you are truly next level. literal GOAT
0:57  it doesn’t even sound like numbers anymore😭😭😭
5:58 Considering what many fans have been saying, I think they’d celebrate and find a way to get that random trooper a name.
who is there to employ? 6:57
dude tf2 has leaked its way every nook and cranny of the internet
2:29 no that's the space marines
1:07 nah, Disney did that themselves.
Badger getting that Vegeta-Mcdonalds hairline
2:15 Bananakin
1:49 do NOT mess with EA
0:57,   SIXXX SEVENNNNN
Badger isn't bass boosted enough
I am back to watch this again and also if it ever comes out badger has got to play battlefront 3
0:57 SIX SEVEN🤙🤙👅💯
9:00 yes. Yes it did.
"space Vietnam with bears and Lazers" is age-restricted badger!😢
Omagad the hats in the "they gave me money" part are a TF2 reference (badger play TF2)
6 7 🔊 🗣 🔥
9:02 well the trailer for rust dropped so
8:46 Hahaha!! 🤣 13:42 "Bite my shiny metal ass!" Shut it clanker.
how does it make you feel that this was there very first video that came up when i searched "Star wars battlefront 2" on youtube
Did he become a Rick the door technician copy 0:47
It says no weapons but what about armor
0:57 s-six seven..?!
@5:53 id pay to see that
New rule: never watch badger while drinking Pepsi
0:20 “do they have ‘the guy in the chair’”
0:35 Signal Calibration In Progress Please Wait...
Bananakin Skywalker
Yeah, I remember when vids were funny and enjoyable to watch. I supported your endeavors to take time for your creativity, but you've fallen flat instead.
battle front 3 spred the word
10:25 funny
they should try the BB droid heroes, absolutely hilarious to run in, stun an enemy hero, and then just leave to let another hero finish the job because of you. Or just run in the middle of a multi-hero fight and cause chaos. The BB droids are absolute trolls.
are all the battlefronts starwars??
IS THAT HAMPSTER CHEEKS!?
Was that Rick the door technician
my dude is killing bot for16 mins and is celebrating it
It’s crazy how incredibly unfunny someone can be. The russian badger is not funny in the fucking slightest.
Battlefront 2 Is making a come back for real now badger
WASSUP MY CLANKA
Bananakin skywalker is goated
Who’s here in 2025?
I want to see @badger @trafalger and any other YouTube poop play any game together
12:30 Only on TheRussianBadger can I hear "The First Order" and "based" in the same sentence and get a chuckle out of it.
Battlefront 3
Boles roor should have made an appearance
Seriously please make another video of this game. It is popular again and the game is on SALE
Here's a weird fact: Sometimes, if you play online in garden warfare 2 with other people, lasers from battle front 2 might glitch their way in, leaving a green or red laser just hanging in the air till the match ends. Oddly, this was most common for me in the zomboss mech factory.
4:02 I think bro likes Salacious B Crumb😭
Jorksune
10:29
I think Badger and Company could've made better star wars films and shows than any of the official stuff without even trying
Ik its been three years but im watching this again and he animated the cocking of the gun at 0:21. When he pulled back the slide he also pushed it forward, which if you have a properly functioning gun then it should go forward by itself. Pushing the slide forward could actually damage the gun.
Quite frankly, your entire squad would be better in a SPACEBALLS movie than a Star Wars movie, y'all would just fit in too well.
It's crumy boy😁
Gimme bubba, I want bubba, oh I got bubba
15:48 to remind myself where this bit is.
Battlefront 2 and plants versus zombies battle for neighborville are the same game with different lore and it's so fun :)
Start playing Star Wars Battlefront II its back
can't wait for part 3 in four months time when the bf2 resurgence has died
Hey, Badger - Battlefront 2 is blowing up again. Ya feel like returning to it with the gang at all?
* George Lucas will remember that*
The game lives again! come back
That stupid signal calibration bit made me laugh way harder than it should have.
Aged like fine wine these videos did ❤
Me guessing who Master Chief replaced: Finn
Hoopla.
BATTLEFRONT III
#battlefront3 spread the word
RESURGEEE
the algorithm knows what its doing recomending rhis to me now...
Pretty sure the movie did come out
13:42 Pov: "You're playing marvel rivals and the other team has a lord spider-man."
Battlefront III when?
Me when fready fazbear deviant art. 5:25
i love watching old vids fro comidic relief
If you hate the unbalance in battlefront, play helldivers
Grevious is the best hero, no argument
Rust is now out
Bananakin skywalker is still funny
Its like going to war high with the boys, seeing Master Chief, Bananakin Skywalker, and Spiderman
Me, when I used to be homeless World gets glassed by the empire...   Well, they finally solved the homeless crisis.
EA literally abandons kids like that one dad who has DEFINITELY over 30 kids and refuses to pay child support.
The fact that this video is coming back after Bf2’s resurgence is hilarious.
Battlefront 3
i am actually blind in my left eye
If kirbys in the video, then it's peak
2025 anyone one
BATTLEFRONT 3
STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT 3 MAY BE A DREAM NOW, BUT WE WILL MAKE IT REAL, SPREAD THE  WORD TROOPERS KEEP FIGHTING FOR THE REPUBLIC!!!
12:29 Sorry, but how the fuck do you justify shoulder checking mf with a back pack. WHY IS THERE ASSISTED SHOULDER CHECKING
We need Battlefront 3
For the republic
Who’s here during the resurgence?
Battle front 3
3:56 why does he like salacious crumb so much
0:10 the most auditorily painful 8 seconds of my life
Badger really coughed up the whole dark evil pack
Duuude. Sorry if my handwriting is bad but I’m higher than giraffe balls and ts was funny as f*ck. And my Freind got some weird idea and got lost in though and blanked Ty for making this vid dudes.
battlefront 3!!!
we need a part 2 for the come back
Felt appropriate to pick this video back up
Battlefront 3
Battlefront 3
Hey new battle front video it blew up
This is perfect for the current occasion
FOR THE REBELLION FOR BATTLEFRONT III!
Badger and Zanny need to be at the forefront of the BF3 resistance. FOR REPUBLIC, FOR DEMOCRACY!!!
We sooooo back
3 years later and battlefront 2 is soooo back, LETTTTTSSS GO!!!
Battlefront 3!!!! Make video about Battlefront 3!!!
Battlefront 3!!!! Make video about Battlefront 3!!!
8:56 Well that movie ended up coming out and I don’t think many people watched it
"It was already toxic, why not make it radioactive" -TheRussianBadger, 2022
The fact that this was recommended at 1 am is hilarious
8:35 Hannah and Irish from battlefield 4, great game lots of memories
Battlefront 3
this game is really good if only they kept updating it till this day and add more content
It has come full circle X3
7:20 in the chat it says “in soviet russia badger rushes YOU”
Who else here during the great battlefront 2 resurgence of 2025
Badger 100% should play with Battlefront plus
10:30 average black man and cop interaction
THERE IS GONNA BE A NEW FUCKING UPDATE ON MARCH 21 2025
i feel like master chief belongs in star wars
I think he likes the Star Wars lizard monkey
Fun fact just looked it up rewarching this the movie "Rust" just had a very quiet release on may 2nd
I can't hear you ooloh ur using big words I'm to dumb use smaller words
4:00 Current is like: the fuq this mf doin with his money
14:20 The fact you were even able to get custom sounds and view models for Master Chief’s weapons is crazy 😂 Also, I think it’s hilarious that the First Order is better in this game than in the actual movie
11:02 this shit would make me pissed😂😂😂
Is there a VOD?
Can’t wait to level master cheif next match 😂
Bananakin skywalker
The “Come here ray I’m boutta turn you  into a fucken hot pocket” got me dying 😂😂😂 5:36
The rust movie came out btw
u and ur friends make every game look 100 times better
BANANAKIN SKYWALKER!!!!!
2:31 DE PUT DA MATHTER CHEEF IN DA SUDA
Badger your hairline is receding too far
the scout's dance at the was so funny!
6:15-7:08 8:46-9:29 13:42-14:42
02:50 the attention to detail in animating Salacious D. Crumb in SFM is perfect, PERFECT.
I miss when making everyone immortal was the worst thing BF2 hackers were doing
9:36 *DEATH CLOAKER*
Did someone mentioned [TITLE CARD]
why does youtube think this is about GOD OF WAR II
Did someone just say that unemployment falls to 0 when you commit genocide on a planet🤣? You can't glass a planet and say "I did it because it solved unemployment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am not shitting you I got a Star Wars ad while watching this
Mini gun solos all :)
IT'S BANANAKIN
Don't worry, Badger, you can't ruin Star Wars anymore than Disney can
9:00 the movie came out, it's called Rust and it released November 2024
👍👍
ayo do you play fallen order? that is where the scout trooper character you were using came from, that is the baton scout trooper!
16:14 bruh he sounds like a vibrating phone
I don't mind if you scream at me this whole video it makes it more funny
Getting called a sweat playing flamethrower..  I mean, have you been around a fire before lads?
Damn badger, didnt know you loved scelatious crum so much
9:28 “1v1 me on rust” -Alec Baldwin
I'm gonna bite you
Chill the FUCK OUT with the Adverts! Omg…
That’s my Glup Shitto 4:02
Baneniken skiwaker
I need to know if badger has used the droid with a knife cause it is chaos when used right
Just like her parents 5:39
Wait, he thinks HE ruined star wars?
5:03 this did not age well. Star Wars has gone to shit lately.
All this time we protected Star Wars from bad lore, copyright infringements and modders, but the greatest threat came from within 😭
Wow, you manage to ruin the star wars franchise more than Disney itself, you need a world record for that.
Oh, I haven't seen this one?
Just recently found out Battlefront II has a community made server system (Called Kyber) and a mod collection that goes with it, so we can still go online and play like dipshits
12:26 they fly now? They fly now
I don’t know why a Droid screaming ITS SPIDER-MAN is so funny to me
LOVEEE BF2 it’s still an amazing game and the community still thrives after the game stopped updating, and mods were a big part in keeping the community alive!
Okay, it's been about 2 years, has anybody figured out what the Mandoa says at the bottom of the screen around the 0:30 mark?
BANANAKIN SKYWALKER
2025?
We need another episode of this in the future. This Shit is peak
9:05 to 9:27 got me shitin bricks-
bananakan Skywalker
4:59 little did he know the woke community would try to destroy this in 2023. Funny how badger predicted that they will fail. They are meticulously protected. 😅😅😅  BTW badger you are still the goat. 😂🎉😂.
i watched this while half asleep, i am not dissapointed
POV:when someone says “is that movie coming out?”  Yoda in the corner:”NaaaOOO”
Bananakin skywalker 2:12
At 10:45 he was just explaning tf2
Disney owns both Star Wars and Marvel, so Spider-Man fighting Darth Vader is canon.
Dude is tis a fortnite refrence
Bananakin skywalker
Jet trooper: charges   Me in my head: *demoman charge sound effect*
That’s the death trooper in lore too
bro said this game wasnt fair :( respectuflly you just versed the most robotic people sir.
Can't tell you how many heros I murked with explosive rounds 😂
5:42 that Kylo was PISSED at you
I remember playing a match of Supremacy and I was a Flametrooper and I kid you not when I say I got like 70 kills without dying. Yeah he's kinda broken tbh.
"You were my brother Bananakin! I loved you!"
did you know stormtroopers are "elites"
anyways free tay-k
Fav characters:first order Fav weapons:empire Fav era to play in:clones
7:46 well duck you too badger.
Me maining the heavy class, while dancing to Metallica
Bro posts like twice a year and he cooks every time
10:30 *Breathe In* Hello, Mar- *Gun Shot* POV: You're opening the door for the ATF
13:14 You can't even get in
THE REPUBLIC IS THE BEST.
Latterly team fortress 2 -> 10:44
how did you meet your friends like????
Badger needs to play titanfall 2
At 9:35 what is that noise
4:35 turn the card around coward.
Oh no
These videos are practically a review in YouTube Poop format, though much more re-watchable.
fun fact: the preview/intro is exactly 30 seconds long
You say that it’s a bad idea to connect your group and Star Wars but they’re doing a far better job than whatever the hell Disney is up to
why is there a constant computer fan at 100% noise in the mocap scenes?
2 years later, that Rust film is still the works. Despite the dumb mofo that was in charge of the props, fucked up royaly.
14:10 that is true if the people you kill have names like Djuj Bellis or CT-1828 thats most likely an AI
Bananakin Skywalker
am i the only one that wants to see them goofify plants vs zombies garden warfare and garden warfare two?
11:08 who was talking about the Salamanders from warhammer 40k in the background here lol
https://youtu.be/ZGLAS6o2T1w?t=289 I choked on my coffee because of this single joke xD
0:09 oh my god. It like Fortnite, the guy from Fortnite. *NO! DON'T! THAT'S MY BIT, BRO.*
2:12 who drinks rum during a stream
At 0:37 the text at the bottom of the screen is in the written form of the Mandalorian language (known as Mando'a).
you should try one hit - i like pain
“Yo it’s the guy from fortni-“ Me: GET SLAPPED 🏒
I just want to know... he knows so much about salacious, is his star wars know further or is that it... lmao
"When the lasers start flying, it's still something special", I must be flying lasers
OMG its Bananakin Peelwalker
Did anyone notice the mandarin language in 0:30? Anyone know what it says?
lore accurate Kirby
just so you know there is an offical salacious b crumb lego minifigure
PARRY THIS YOU FLITHY WIZARD
6:54 say what you will about the empire, they brought inflation to 0 on Alderaan
finnaly i can watch this again
2:19 the sheer terror in his voice…
1:04 he achieved my life goal … cough and fart at the same time…
0:24 YES!!!!
Loved bananakin
Just noticing that Badger's favorites of each generation are the Clones, the Empire, and the First Order, makes me wonder if he's still riding that Platinum Drip high from Fallout: New Vegas.
2:22 Lean with a hint of coke
POTASSIUM POWER!!!!
WE NEED MOAR BATTLEFRONT II
this isn't even a joke i actually am blind in my left eye
bananikin skyalker
6:37 the moment he says the unemployment rate falls to zero is crazy
A yes. My favorite Jedi, the mighty…                Massive Leaf
“Weed has been legalized!” Hasn’t it always been- oh wait, not in California, NOTHING IS LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA AND IT HAS THE MOST CRIME! WTF?!
5:00 well that didn't age well.
2:28 the fear in heavenly’s voice screaming “ITS MASTER FUCKING CHIEF”
0:33 1:02
I love the imagery of Heavenly as Glamrock Freddy just going "No!" in such a horrified tone XD
Rust (the Alec Baldwin shot someone) movie is coming out late 2024
WHY THE FUCK IS RUSSIANBAGER SO FUCKING FUNNY!
"what the fuck did i drink mann" is the best part for me
Play battlefront 1
ok bender 13:46
5:29 Star wars but sh*t actually gets done!
2:17   Bananakin Skywalker
i love  this chanel
"banankin", *DAWG 😭🤚*
9:02 The Voicecrack 🤣
2:12 Bananakin Skywalker
Started learning how to make mods for this game recently, find it hilarious I find this video now. Mods and friends definitely help to make this game a lot better.
6.9 million views
The first order is total trash, in game or in the movie
“The rate of literally everything drops to zero.” “That doesn’t make him WRONG!”
Badger the 🐐 for real
Banakin Fruitwalker!!!
BADGER THEY HAVE A PLUSH OF HIM
Bro is obsessed about Salacious B Crumb
The missile knows where it is
If the first of the new series actually ended with Rey getting scorched by a flametrooper, it would have been way better than the new trilogy overall
two years later, still annoyed that there was no hvv 1v1s, lightsaber duels are peak
Bananakin.
Bananakin Skywalker
DICE actually left the game to work on battlefield 2042
2:11 my favorite for some reason
I haven’t been in a lobby with a hacker yet. But I haven’t been playing this game for 4 or 5 years and I just started playing again
bananakin skywalker
Yavin 4 has nothing but a sith temple so it legit may just save the galaxy
7:46 WHAT DID I DO?
fucking blows up a planet yo guys i fixed inflation now you still cant buy a house
can someone tell me what the hell he talking about based or cringe in the time stamp 5:23?
Wait what the fuck I just sat back down and I haven't touched the rum yet why is FUCKING Skywalker a banana 🍌 HAHAHA 😅😂
Seeing Badger Play Battlefront Reminds Me How Bad I Am At The Game
Am I the only one who doesn’t understand a single thing they are saying
Bananakin skywalker
As of recently, the game has been pretty patched up. ᕦ😎ᕤ
9:10 💀 dawg that’s crazyyy
We need nothing but jaw footage of all the recordings used for the video
To anyone who hates hackers but wants to play, console doesnt have that issue at all.
If you blow up a planet, technically for one single second, the unemployment rate goes to like 10000000% *and then* to 0%
Bajur: "star wars lore is protected"  Disney: hold my beer, and wait, lemme grab master chiefs helmet there too
9:16 "Heavenly are you okay?" in the background
"Oh lightsabers can take blaster bolts? Parry this you filthy casual"
Badger got that Silacious crumb drip!
He shouldn’t have gotten in trouble for the baby yoda thing baby yoda is 50 years old
Crum is evey ware
Badger when no Crumb: 😡
Bro you could have made a kool aid man joke wit hte jet troooer
I come back to this video every once in a while for the good brain juice
How does this guy does not have 100002 subs
Not only was employment at zero, so was the crime rate and world hunger. The upsides keep coming, just saying.
Last video was literally todays topic slavery
How does he make those animations
Y'all remember that "Troopers" fan film?  Yeah, I want that, but a Disney+ show, and it stars Badger's crew.
Gotta love tf2 references
Badger talking and admiring how comunity saves 4 year old game, meanwhile tf2 almost 17 year old videogame and still somehow alive throught the power of comunity.
Star Wars Episode X The Unfuckening: Rey gets roasted for heresy and any characters from the original trilogy that are still alive go back in time to get George Lucas to make the sequels anyway while also shooting Rian Johnson and J.J. Abrams along the way
I kill yoda 5 times with a heavy
@GeorgeLucas
13:05 Scorch cameo
2:37 RIP Salacious Crumb
This video is two years old and it still holds up
the 1HP hack got patched now
12:27 They Fly Now!?
Who here after they announced the originals being released in march
13:09 Who in their right mind would play as a battle droid, the single worst cannon fodder in Star Wars?
11:55 Tropical Punch or Blue Raspberry Lemonade?  Because for serious, Blue Raspberry Lemonade is my favorite but jammers and bursts are mid AF. About as equally mid as Capri Sun actually.
1:35 If you didn't mod in Pink Darth Vader, I will be sorely disappointed.
0:10 Spider-Man, Master Cheif, a handful of Star Wars characters. All that's missing are Jonsey, Peely, getting jobbed Fishstick getting jobbed, Meowscles, Peter Griffin, Deadpool and a million Winterfest Bushrangers getting non-canonically jobbed and it will be exactly like Fortnite.
1:27  ☝️🤓 its actually called a taun taun or something along the lines of that
I just realized that the text at 0:39 is mandalorian. Idk what it says though.
6:51 Why not? The empire probably did!
Bananakin Skywalker 2:22
That crumbussy got badger acting salacious
Honestly though if Finn was Master Chief I would nonstop play the Resistance
You're sweating due to the heat of the flamethrower
i didnt know rick the door technician had a yt series
What's so bad about saying cunt
Wow I can't wait to go to school today!  *TF2 domination sound effect*  Oh
6:39 employment ıs at zero too
SCOUT TROOOPEER!!!!
Way better thanthe new starwars lol
As a starwars fan I saw the title and I choked on my water.
“What the fu-“ *succumbs to smoking wheeze*
Yeah, I love this video so much.
Hkdneidbejsnf bro really got selacsious croumb meech
2:18 Me after having my pint of Guinness and sit down to a game and me friends did something like making anikan skywalker a bannana!
Badger is just like me for real. Always forgetting what he’s going to say
15:53😂😂
Why are you talking for most of the video instead of showing gameplay
"Weed may have been legalized, but you're the one getting smoked gobby!"
badger, i quote you daily
Peace of art😂
Just if anyone wanted to know spider-Man did get his on Tokusatsu series in the 70s.
Why do I feel like theese guys act like stormtroopers would act
So EA has enough time to glass anyone how mods too much of the game but can't even a second to fix a game ruining exploit. Wow such a amazing triple-A company
There is nothing disrespectful about screwing Rey over.
Dustin freaking out over Bananakin made my day.
peanut butter and gasoline? Not go to together?? As an honor bound pure blood red white and blue AMERICAN. I must disagree.
Fun fact. Flamethrowers are still legal under the Geneva Convention. Most militaries retired their used because they were deemed inhumane and because nobody wanted to be a flametrooper
"You're behavior frightens and confuses me, sir." Ah, the memories of being the WORST Republic Commando and having to have SCORCH carry me through the game.
Ain’t you selatious B?
Ah yes Peterkin skyparker is my favourite Jedi too
Bannanakin Skywalker is great
"That is all that I have to say" proceeds to yap on for another 29 seconds.
The most searched video game character on the pronhub this year was chun-li from fornite. I almost punched my computer when i read during me and my mates yearly reading of their statistics
1:04 Badger has used 23 cameras
Stoles crunbe...... fuck
It was already not lore accurate when the stormtroopers can actually learn to land their shots.
I could absolutely see badger as a belligerent scout trooper ngl.
God, my brain rot is worsening. Yesterday I was out drinking, today I have a headache and for whatever reason decided that today is the perfect day to binge through Badger videos again. When Spiderkin Manwalker first showed up I didn't even process that for several seconds, he looked like normal Anaking to me
what is your fav star wars character mines boba fett
Are we overlooking the fact that this man used to work in FINANACE?-
What's the outro song?
2:15 when I saw Anakin as a banana I thought of 1 thing, bananakin
0:53 i very much like when you switched the cameras you used the select sound from the OG Battlefront Games
Imma need everyone to send this to George Lucas
5:48 to be honest I would love that a lot more
I feel like I want to see a third video to complete the trilogy
We need TF2!
This badger 🦡 sounds more American 🇺🇸 than Russian 🇷🇺
7:25 bros telling you how to make napalm 😂😂😂
The most surprising thing in this video to me was the fact that badger worked in finances of all industries. I just find that funny for some reason
Gregory, bite my shiny metal ass, Gregory.
God, I love that Master Chief Sequence. Now I want to see a Star Wars Halo crossover.
I actually beat both of this games campaigns.
Salacious B. Crumb is love, Salacious B. Crumb is life
You really like salacious crumb. Is there something you'd like to tell us?
Game’s developers give up on is what my mom did to me
SRB2 with me pls
I'm glad everyone agrees we all hate the Resistance and Rey is not a good character
This video is an example of when you let Badger give a blood transfusion from TABG to any other modable game
I swear i wish i would have Friends like you Guys with you playing anything is fun and great no matter what you Play because as soon as you havr someone you can have fun with and that is as stupid as you everything makes fun but sadly i not even i have one friend like that to play with and that since years and i really dont play as much anymore since i have no one that i can Play with like you Guys because its not really fun 🤔😅😕
WHY ARE YALL SO FUNNY!
Hmmm I wonder if I know about him?
Is it just me or is badger the only YouTuber, when he gets sponsors I LIKE watching them he some how make’s sponsors/ads fun to watch?
“kirby just clapped maul’s cheeks” got me rolling
Man is the definition of stupidity over high school education
How did chopper die?!?
10:30   Hello- *ded*
bro kerby as yoda is scary holy moly what the fu-
play night of the ewoks
They should play titanfall 2 since they fixed all the server issues
Something about the way he says “It’s SPIDER MAN Oh my god!” Is the most hilarious thing I’ve heard in awhile.
Anakin is Bananakin, because he has no Planakin.
I was not expecting to see Irish and Hannah from BF4 in the background.
7:47 Kirby uses his true power
“I just really like Salacious Crumb man, I don’t know what to tell you.”
I would pay Disney's CEO directly, if it meant we get a star wars movie that's just 4 generic stormtroopers arguing like dipshits at the cafeteria table for 90 minutes.
9:35 the payday 2 cloaker audio made me shit myself instantly 😮
YOU LIED BADGER. You told us about the sponsor in THREE minutes not two!!!
Bager turns ray into hot pocket his character pary this you filfy wizard
Last thing I expected was to find the salacious b crumb fanbase  I'm not saying it's wrong or that I don't like it, I'm just saying it's absolutely the last thing I expected
Honestly I wish that’s how the new series ended. Try getting turned into a hot pocket by a random flametroooper. Better than what we got
1:00 I think that storm trooper had a bit of that legalized marijuana.
What's the tropper name In 5:04
Banana-kin Skywalker?
2:21 Is it me or is this everyone after they drank way too much guinness?
make moar
It’s Bananakin
"Recognized and protected." "Were it so easy.."
1:49  2:21  3:30
Fuck the empire where my clones at
I love that Kylo caught on and was basically the stick holding the marshmallow over the campfire
Haflambe
I honestly what a "Badger breaking character" compilation
Apparently clone troopers call droideka’s - rollies other then clacker
bananakin skywalker
Amazing! Part 2 please!
My guy this is the humor I have craved for a millenia. Do not stop posting
As a die hard star wars fan, it would be better than anything else disney has done.
Petition to make badger and the gang play genshin impact co op.for tge shits and gigs
i def thought he was gonna talk about the sith trooper’s running melee, a tae-kwon-do kick of death
0:06 - 2:01 SPIDER-MAN in Star Wars Battlefront 2 EA!!!
Your litterally the best and funniest YouTuber ever seen 👑
You drank rat poison
We need this man to play undertale
Well, half the lore is dead now. So... Shit.
9:34 The cloaker sound got me
5:45 Alright i feel like star wars fans really like this
This is like me and my crackhead friends
Frigg you spiderman
If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus Is Lord' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. -Romans 10:9
Well, it was so carefully maintained . . . Before SHE arrived
It does my heart good to see ANYONE familiar enough with Star Wars lore to know Salacious Crumb’s name 😂
16:12 MF sounded like a microwave goin' "MMMMMMMMMMMM"
Hi
Stormtroopers arguing for Unemployment via Death Star gives me that Red VS Blue classic I've needed for ages. Here's hoping for "Spartans Argue for Halo Rings Activated to Solve the Insurrection, Covenant AND Flood."
why are your videos so funny i had a stroke frum laghping to munch in the last one
Hearing him treat normal Star Wars lore as refined and serious is funny to me considering what it was before Disney tried to streamline it all
Badgers outro looks like the walk you do when your balls be stuck to your thighs after driving for hours
Man had a point: Alderon's crime/homeless/drug problems all went to 0 after the Empire showed up.
5:33 Vader is in the middle of telling Luke he is his father then gets a bullet to the brain from heavenly holding a awp
Less than one damn second into the video he is going Mach speed into the distance
bananakin
Wait there’s custom upgrade cards for the modded skins! It’s Redon to fit the characters!
Actually blows my mind Americans don’t have “online banking” like Europe ..😅
13:12
10:30 I spit my drink when this happened
Like u can get mods badger be like SIGN ME DA FUCK UP
You should do another battlefront 2 video using character mods like Sabine,Ezra,Bo Katan,captain Rex,commander Cody,fives,thrawn,shae vizla and the armorer.
Ea:bans you for turning Anakin into a banana. Also ea: doesn't ban literal cheaters for making everyone invincible
He is fucking hilarious
Badger: *FUCK YOU SPIDER-MAN* Me who’s bassed on Spider-Man: ?!
Bananakin Skywalker is def the best mod y'all added lol
bro looks like offbrand sheldon cooper
Salacious. Bartholomew. Crumb
7:07 everything except death rates go down
Amazing
9:46  WAIT A MUNITE  IM ACTUALLY BLIND IN MY LEFT EYE IM NOT KIDDING
I hope you drink mustard
I'm so happy you used a voice lone from star wars republic commandos
I resisted the urge so hard in order not to say “oh she’s a hot pocket alright” after dude said he’d turn Rey into a hot pocket 💀
Give us your card numbers
Badger would make a super ridiculous TV show if they gave him full control
2:18 bananakin Skywalker
I dig it.
This video made me laugh so much it somehow made me throw up a bit, making go down my nose. Only made worse by the fact there were chilies in my food.
10:30 hello, ma... *Gun Shot*  Jeezes f__k!!!
15:53 Hnggh waiffff???
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
OMG these are so damn funny!
11:07 All who live, Die by the flame.
10:44 nice Badger   But ...                   *The Titanfall franchise would like to have a word with you*
Rust the movie Alec Baldwin killed a woman during is still coming out.
Ay yo YouTube y'all know that jabba the Hutt is infact a slaver right? How the hell y'all gonna age restrict and demonetize my boi for something that is a complete fact.
Bananakin Skywalker
This video is better than the actuall battlefront 2
Seriously. You need to be in future starwars movies. Stormtroopers would be so much more hilarious
I've met Tim Rose at Comicon
I also love the joke about the hutts. Such a politician response
bananakin  skywalker
Day 2 of watching all of badgers video. 😂 these are good
Badger in Star Wars is like that one storm trooper that bumped his head but like 10x dumber
Ah yes Spider Man my favorite Jedi
I love battlefield 4 sooo mutch
jokes on you Disney ruined the star wars franchise
He talks about playing as salashis b crum. But he never shows any mods of him
Bager: FUCK YOU SPIDER-MAN FUCK YOU SPIDER-MAN I HATE YOU FUCK YOU SPIDER-MAN BITE MY SHINY METAL ASS!!!!!!!!!
YO-HO-HOOO THEY GOT BANANAKIN SKYWALKER
Current? the only thing thats Current is me Currently having a stroke
broooo 6:55 had me dying of laughter there man
Your not russian
Im beginning to think russian badger likes salicious crumb
Update the Alec Baldwin has come out
Dug for for dirt, struck cringe…
"Pretty sure he had to pay his rent with beans" that has me on the floor crying right now
Its bananakin Skywalker
6:18 in a raw sense Yavin 4 should have gotten glassed 3 movie sequels ago😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should play dying light there’s a lot of people you can make fun of that can’t do anything about it
My favorite Jedi spider the banana master
Bros got the voice of markiplier and the face of Carl azuz
As someone who used to play battlefront classical on an old laptop for fun, it's amazing how different 2 is
whait im from fortnite?
This man is obsessed with selatious crumb
I rarely find a hacker anymore in a server
6:48 actually, they did not commit genocide on a planet.  Yavin 4 is a moon.
13:45 Best Part
Bananakin
Bananakin
6:13 a show about a group of Stormtroopers voiced by Badger and his friends would be better than the entirety of Disney Star Wars
Look up saki it's sad
thank god for all these sponsors, don't know what i'd do without Badgers shitposting.
Badger is the only person that makes me actually listen to sponsers
You saved Star wars by killing Rey
If this guy gets his hands on a flamethrower, run, just run f9r your goddamn life
I dont even know how the things he does in this video are even possible. You know its qualiity when you, as an editor, severly doubt your own understanding of your own craft 😂
I FUCKING NEED THESE MODS
9:45 [chuckles] Boomer.
Homicide rates also go to zero
I just want to say, I would like to rip yoda in half with my bare hands
I wonder happened to Current
BRUH
OBI ONE CORNOBY: Bananakin I have the pie ground😂😂😂
6:18 as another side bonus to this particular thread of conversation. crime is also way down as well.
ha imagine being on computer version where ther's hackers
You see the hardest part about this is actually getting that group of friends that makes any game fun.
detauns your taun taun*
He may be quality over quantity, but DAMN that still is a fair amount of video he’s made
No offense but you look like G-man
Also does current debit have fees
Hey George Lucas I got a fun video for you to see, I swear it’s great
Kool-Aid Jammers are trash.
Is Badger married!?!
What if all the movies was just a force Vision Anakin was having
I love how Badger can turn LITERALLY ANY GAME into a shitpost.
Did anyone else get the republic commando reference
0:05 it wasn’t 2 minutes later
2:57 Before I unwrap this Whopper  That has aged like a fine wine
Congratulations Alderan, you're unemployment rate has reached rock fucking bottom
Give me death trooper and I could kill entire server if rebels
Honestly the sequels would have been much better if Rey was turned into a burrito by a random trooper. Because then there’s no sequels! 😂
Bananakin Skywalker is glorious
Salacious B. Crumb was, in fact, Badger's dad (Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away...)
I don’t know how to animate in SFM but I still recognize over half the models he uses.
0:12 im about to order 66 his a**
You should be an arc trooper for the clone army.
if I ever meet someone in person who goes "Like (X) from Fortnite" I will not be legally accountable for any crimes I commit to said person.
need a  TheRussianBadger battlefront vr in contractors vr
Actually just started hopping back on to BF2 and servers finally aren’t fucked
Remember when you talked about Star Wars battlefront finally having a reboot and Darth Vader was driving a tauntaun the original one
Quack
I just imagine some rebel or jedi sneaking around on some base and they end up hearing the conversation about blowing up a planet and unemployment rate in the middle of a movie, like that would be amazing
Idk what he’s talking about, non hero classes can be hella fun
Yall should play Star Wars Battlefront 2 2005
Bananakin Skywalker
4:54 SIGN ME THE F**K UP
Star Wars episode 420 badger becomes J. Jonah Jameson.
Flame troopers are the one of the best in the game.

Bananakin
I kinda wanna try a peanut butter and gasoline sandwich now.
May 1 2018
8:45 is gold. The VC singing the TF2 dominating jingle has penetrated my brain.
Did the death trooper said boomer or bulma from dragon ball z 🤔
2:28 The real life TERROR in his voice. XD
Homie you can have first person in Battlefront 2 and It's even more wacky
Bananakin Skywalker. That is all
Just remember Leia leads the entire Rebellion so like, the population of Aldeeran is like 100%
Bananakin
Xbox servers are still going strong, left pc ones for it and worth it
7:19 - as a russian, i can confirm the thing in red
I just need you to turn the credit card around
Yo, you used to work in finances? What do you think of Primerica?
Hearing 5:00 in 2023 did not age well
If you want more stupid and chaotic mods, Kyber is a community that is "updating" the game with mods by themselves and aren't getting banned because everyone in the community plays on private servers.
4:59 Aged like Milk, ain't nothing meticulously thought out or protected about Star Wars nowadays.
COOL LADE TRooPERS
I can say I have never laughed so much at a single video before! Thank you for existing!
Guys, I think his Favorite Character Is Salacious Crum
The old battlefront games were far more balanced. Loved being a regular stormtrooper killing a bunch of Jedi every match on the ps2
I just realized something watching this for the 3rd time. Badger dead ass looks like an evil organizations accountant.
idk if it's my shity ass wifi or the stuff you did to starwars but either way it crashed my pc
9:19 “heavenly are you ok?” Who the hell is that?
hear me out, it might sound crazy BUT... I think badger might like Salacious Crumb
9:17 heavenly are you ok
I watch the sponsors cuz badger makes them enjoyable
8:38 - 9:16 is priceless! The ATF jokes are great, too!
It's been 0:05 and I'm already laughing.
2:15 Bananakin Skywalker
I would actually pay attention to the star wars movies again if badger and his gang show up in one of them
You forgot the biggest copyright they did Jack Sparrow from fortshit
Salacious Crumb
Fun fact, the Star wars comics has a scene where people you shotguns, like ordinary shotguns, against Jedis because lightsabers can't deflect shotgun bullets
Bananakin
Show us the numbers on the back
I always thought Selacious Crumb was a pet
That right click hits harder than Chris brown wtf
8:45
I would honestly watch a series where it's just a bunch of random troopers fucking around like you guys. I truly would watch that.
I think he likes solacious B. crumb
can someone translate the mando'a at 0:36
I love Kirby with a lightsaber😂
man he is good at doing ads
I would love a series that just follows a group of storm troopers going about their days and missions with dumbass banter like in this video. It could be the most serious plot imaginable and yet somehow the goofiest goobers show up and talk about wondering how glassing a planet could "effect the Burger King economy."
They really brought Bananakin into this
Will you ever do a tf2 video I would just love that
Okay now just Anakin as a banana is the most down right funniest thing I've ever seen in my whole 19 years of my damn life LOL.
Bruh, that blind in your left eye hit harder for me cuz I’m going blind in my left eye
How did EA not ban you
Banana-kin Skywalker.
Pyro in battle front confirmed
Me wondering what I’ve been drinking after seeing this
Recently started playing Battlefront II on co-op missions, glory to the republic man cuz clones are fucking overpowered.
This bro is too funny 😂
Dude looks like vegeta if he shaved his hair off
Bf2 2017 mods are good but bf2 2002 are flawless
Salacious crumb is my idol
This goes to badger I've been playing warface for the past 3 days and I managed to unlock what seems to be a Remington 870 cb is it any good
Loved how you use the sound effects from the og Star Wars battlefront
I feel like I was just in a fever stream while watching this video
bro created kfc with a flamethrower, can I have some
The Covenant when they see Chief charging head on into battle: 2:28
Badger: "It's like peanut butter and gasoline: these two things were never meant to be together, but somehow the universe found a way."  Me: "ah yes this peanut butter kush ought to do nicely"
Makes sense the gremlin likes the gremlin
Warthunder
Badger: *takes form of scout trooper for narration* Also badger never once using a scout trooper in the video
I love any game with flamethrowers
I don’t even play call of duty but I still love these videos
Bro, this content is awesome, and it's hilarious to watch you guys play SWBF with that kind of humor. I got into battlefront a bit before finding your channel, and both are awesome because of the humor. Thank you so much for the content, I'm making a playlist of your videos to loop bc this is some of the funniest shit I've ever seen.
Heavenly are you ok
how is this 1 year old
i recently started playing this game and fuck them jedis and sith i am the death trooper main, ligit last round before i started watching this i got nearly 100K and i got 1st
I love how Kirby is just permaglued to masterchiefs shoulder
Thanks for showing that this game stil can be fun
This is probably how stormtroopers talk to each other when they're bored
Me... My brain banakin skywalker
The first thing I’m gonna mod into the game once I figure it out is  Steve from Minecraft
11:00 just imagine, you're pushing the objective, the enemy is SUPPOSED to be  falling back, but you open that door and three flame troopers rush out and roast you and ONLY you.
cna you pls play the rajnbow siz siege game cuz i sad 😢😢😢😢😢 no rainbow suz zisge gideos anymore and yea so can pls do it!!! i already watched all the other ones 5 times
Swag
Best. Battlefront II. Video. Of fun!  Hopefully the game keeps giving for years to come. :D
homie, you cant fuck up starwars anymore than Disney has
11:36 "nice roll buddy, really saved you from my flamethrower" Bajur says to the AI NPC
You could get the modded servers so you can play mace windu and palpating with a lightsaber and they are their own characters not cosmetic
Nothing really to say, but I enjoyed this video.  Thanks for making and sharing it.
So EA is basically saying "Don't make our game any more fun than it already isn't."
Alright, so going to translate the Aurebesh scrip half a minute into the video....
The 2 words that describe ANYTHING:  Based and cringe
real question; what does Current invest in?
So why did the current commercial feature a guy that looked like Quinton Terrintino got fused with the bad guy from lazy town….. does your alarm clock play we are number one……. In gourmet coffee?
I have never laugh that much on a "battlefront" video. The animations and montage is juste awesome. And the jokes... god. I will never forgot "we should blow up yavin" moment.
"Who gave me a POV camera?!,what the fu-"
It's over, Bananakin!
*0:42** Star Wars battlefront classic sounds*
BANANAKIN SKYWALKER😳
i swear your the only person that can make me watch the sponsor
I need to watch your videos like 5 times to hear all the shit i missed last time cuz i was laughing
I am so glad that YouTube hasn’t taken this down I need badger Star Wars content
Love the "fuck you, spiderman" montage.
What is up with you in salacious crumb
14:18 Now this is how you should play HALO 3rd person style
Never thought I'd see a loading screen on a Badger video
bro is idiot for thinking any good thiing is from fortnite
hahaha you september 11
I can't believe this video is almost a year old now
6:24 Imagine if this conversation was in the mandalorian season 3 word for word verbatim before a fight scene. Unironically fucking golden.
4:40: Heard the Wake Island theme from Battlefield V.
I never knew this guy existed but now I want even more from him
8:43 Jesus, man, that caught me so off guard! XD
I didn't want to see bananakin, but I did
Am I the only one who noticed the ballin_baldwin420 in the killfeed
Play deep rock galactic
Damn those Alec Baldwin jokes hit a little different now.
Now make a third one-
Scout trooper Deadpool
I modded Spider-Man in this game too it’s so funny
Hnnnnnnng waif?
Try escape from tarkov. nerd.
9:05 showing my 100% off gift card to the cashier
8:44
And the hacking problem is a reason I play against bots.
Scorch from Republic Commando gave me Michelangelo from TMNT vibes, in fact Delta Squad Boss is like Leonardo, Fixer is like Donatello, and Sev is like Raphael. Speaking of TMNT, is there any Ninja Turtles mods?  Edit: He ded. sad. But seriously, where are the TMNT Battlefront 2 mods?!
The Waffle House Has Found It's New Host
0:36   anyone know what this says... just wondering
14:17 this is where the fun begins
at 9:19 does anyone else hear "heavenly are you okay" in a girl's voice?
There’s a reason he gets so many views the quality is ridiculously high.
Oh hey! My bank!
My old person who makes me laugh ssundee for child friendly now: him them like wut the fuck!
random Trooper : PARY THIS YOU FILTY CASUAL Ray : *Dies in flamme*
Dude the arc trooper is broken on the first phase of supremacy on kamino you can just spam the seeking blast across the big gap between spawns and the shit feels like cheating you can just farm fucking clankers and the only threat to you is a sniper which is hot ass unless someone is consistent
I'd love to see them play TF2 and see how wacky they can be in TF2 because TF2 itself is already wacky
W
"Do you guts even know who the MonkeyLizard Salacious B Crumb is?"  Don't you know who the fuck we are?
I just realized that you have a Jedi fallen order stim chest in the background at 0:50
This is the funniest video I’ve seen this year 😂
“The First Order is based.”  Cue 60 minutes of the TFO being literal fascists:
10:29
Something about 7:30 just kills me every time. Just the sheer incredulity and disappointment in Heavenly’s voice with that simple “No!” gets to me lmao
I started downloading star wars battlefront 2 and then youtube autoplay put this video on.
So let me get this straight you got age restricted and demonetize for talking about something in a fictional universe
Day 1 of leaving a comment saying “The Gnomes Shall Rise” on random videos until Valve releases official statues/plushies of Gnome Chompski
0:17 like robocop from fortnite, like john cena from fortnite, like dwayne "the rock" johnson from fortnite, like darth vader from fortnite, like the terminator from fortnite, like will smith from fortnite, like mr beast from fortnite, like the hulk from fortnite, like alien from fortnite, like ninja from fortnite, master chief from fortnite, like kratos from fortnite, like doom guy from fortnite, like lara croft from fortnite, like brie larson from fortnite (captain marvel), like captain marvel from fortnite, like thor from fortnite, like star lord from fortnite, like black widow from fortnite, like LoL jinx from fortnite, like ironman from fortnite, like She-Hulk from fortnite, like among us from fortnite, like pac-man from fortnite, like thegrefg from fortnite, like travis scott from fortnite, like ariana grande from fortnite, like marshmello from fortnite, like michael jordan from fortnite, like michael jordan from fortnite again, Like superman from fortnite, like batman from fortnite, like borderlands from fortnite, like deadpool from fortnite, like batman from fortnite, like john wick from fortnite, like stranger things from fortnite, like the NFL from fortnite, like the NBA from fortnite, like balenciaga from fortnite, like ferrari from fortnite, like lamborghini from fortnite, like rocket league from fortnite, like android from fortnite, like android from fortnite, like android from fortnite, like daredevil from fortnite, like freeguy from fortnite, like street fighter from fortnite, like Jbalvin from fortnite, like black panther from fortnite, like naruto from fortnite, like destiny from fortnite, like the walking dead from fortnite, like the predator from fortnite
Anyone else hear that at 9:20 ?
I’m dying at the image of Rey and Kylo having a lightsaber duel and some random ass Flame trooper came out of nowhere and torched Rey 🤣
like doom slayer from fortnite like darth vader from fortnite like mrbeast from fortnite
13:14 idk why i find this as funny as it does
Peanut butter and gasoline is basically how napalm is made
0:31 to 1:05 is just pure genius starting for this vid
Jesus Christ Loves You❤❤❤
Everyone flying an x-wing then there’s badger in a a10 warthog
you and your entire squad are so fkin hilarious
Oh, my, god, it feels like Badger is what the starwars universe needs, just 1 minute in a starwars movie, where TheRussianBadger and his buddies are talking about something random before a bunch-o-rebels show up
Rey getting toasted to death by a flame trooper is the ending we all wish we got.
You couldn't ruin it anymore then Disney already has.
Can we all appriciate how he suffers for hours and hours to make these videos to entertain us
Kirby yoda :)
God I’d hate to be his accountant
*still trying to understand what the Death trooper said at **8:46*
3:38 was that the tf2 detonator sound?????
BURN IN HOLY FIRE 11:06
Its over Bananaqin, I have the high ground
when you gonna do a vid on star wars movie battles 2 tho?
bruh im watchin this on my new GOOGLE PIXEL 6A and i can crank it up to 1440p 60fps this looks so good, after having an iphone 7 that hardly ran 720 oh my lord this looks so good
“Kirby, you dumb bitch! I hate you so much!”-a heathen(this is a joke i love the video don’t smite me)
Wait, badger is married? How the fuck did I not know this
Bananakin Skywalker
The thing is your guys' conversations are actually kinda canonically accurate to Stormtroopers' actual conversations
My favorite star wars character,  Spiderman with his curved hilted, yellow banana-saber
7:24 Gasoline would be so much better if it smelled like peanut butter, change my mind.
Does the games online still work?
I need a pc
9:00 Huh... Interesting prediction
Bananacan Skywalker
6:17 8:46 I CAN’T
I still run away when I see a Deathtrooper
Mans straight up representing the Scout Corps!
All these problems seem to only be on PC
This man makes me watch the sponsors, that's how good this man is
0:13 From Fortnite?
05:54 An apsolute improvment of the new trilogy. XD
Play Ravenfield
Mm barbecue
As a StarWars fan you didn't ruin it for me  You made it even better
KIRBY WENT GOD MODE😂😂 13:59
should have screamed OH YEAH as you fired the sith trooper right click
Yall have to make a hell let loose video
This is essentially the old eu being revived in this video
Darth vader from fortnight
I wish Battlefront II wasn't fucked. I used to enjoy the game so much, but for the past year my game won't let me connect to the EA servers, then after trying several times, it connects to the EA servers, then crashes. Every fucking time. Sometimes I'm able to try and load into a match, but the screen flickers then crashes before I'm even on the character selection screen. I found some apparent fixes that I'm gonna try, but god damn is this annoying as shit.
Dam your upload schedule is almost as bad as my sleep schedule.
1:08 Russian Badger really do work for Disney.
Bananakin skywalker
Ur the first person I’ve seen that covered up the credit card info
Why did I think for a second that DigitalVagrant was Puffer?
10:47 Is me talking about team fortress 2
The kill before he says nice roll was me 😂 I saw my gamer tag and was very confused
The sponsorship this vid is literally a „Fuck you“ in YT‘s face.
0:17 He deserves a bullet.
It's to late spider man Idaho's will be the only state to not legalize weed
the one youtuber who's sponsor segments i genuinely enjoy watching
Please do a dawn of war vid the emperor needs justice
*metro police death sound from half life 2*
Could you make a video about how you make your animations?
You are the only YouTuber that I can put at 0 volume and it STILL be to loud
Badger reminds me of a younger more hip Carol azus
It’s been 9 months, and I’m still laughing hard.
10:30 POV your in front of Alec baldwin
First 2022 vid
My boyfriend loves your channel ☺️❤️
TheRussianBadger try star wars battlefront 2 (the classic one)
Every Time i listen to this vidéo it makes me want to play it again and then i remember that i dont have friends to play with
Yo surprise George appearance
Ah yes, my favorite jedi: Bannanakin Skywalker.
Strongest class is deffo the Assault class with that fast firing gun that reminds me of the Mac-10 from MW2018
That's it you f****** battlefront devs and movie Makers if you don't put the badge and his crew in the next f****** Star wars movie I quit!!
12:48
1:49 Wait are those the Navy Commandos from The Force Unleashed?
“It’s masta fuckin chief!!!” Is easily one of my favorite lines out of heavenly.
At 9:18 you can here a woman say “heavenly are you ok?”
Go ahead, call mom, YOU CANT UN FUCK THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY :)
There is a mod for the game squad that make it a Star Wars game that, from what I can tell, is even better than battlefront. Its called Galactic Contention.
so at 10:34 what exactly does ATF stand for?
but glassing a planet is a halo thing then again you have master cheif.
Damn medical use only, time to jump and see if I get it prescribed
4:39 what does the bottom text of the standby screen say???
They just brutally murdered scooby doo. AND I LOVED IT! 10:40.
Me a titanfall 2 player: Oh EA abandoning another game?
You think YOURE killing star wars, you should see what Disney has been up to.
Quite sad that BF2 has fallen this far I would really wish for EA to get back into supporting it I've pretty much played since launch in 2017 and I had an absolute BLAST over all these years especially with the updates where we got Obi-Wan, Grievous, Anakin, Dooku, Geonosis and that GIANT battle mode And nowadays I can't even find matches on PC in Europe anymore because there will just be 1 or 2 players in a lobby with no one else ever joining I miss playing this game so much man Wouldn't even care about server hopping tbh as long as I'm finding matches to play in
THE MOIE IS RUST AND ITS STILL BEING MADE BROOOOO
nothin beats BF 2005
Wait hol up ahem... *Microwaves his fuckin mic*
Using the First Order is like using Badger’s Lord Death Of Murder Mountain build from New Vegas
How has he not done tf2
You cant ruin it more than disney already has, its literally fucking impossible
That banter between you and your bros is something I would _absolutely_ want to see in a Star Wars movie.
The one trooper in the monkey brain segment with that walk is so funny I replayed it multiple times!
Do more battlefront 2
I am a hardcore Star Wars fan and the hot pocket Rey joke is 😂
Ain't no fucking way bagder has a wife that shit gotta be his sister acting like his wife
That Alec Baldwin is fucking foul. Funny as hell, but foul.
2:10 Bananakin Skywalker
Salacious crumb looks like a mix between puppy monkey baby and a gremlin
Bruh I'm a star wars super fan and I never knew the friggin monkey lizard had a name. I didn't even think his species was all the way sentient
>See's Master Chief  "Dey put the Mamter Cheeb in de Battafron."
The employment rate goes to 100%. Since 100% of people livin there are employed.
Now we wait for a RIDGE sponsorship so he can carry the current card
0:45 badger is just lowkey flexing that he has the money for 8 cameras and motion capture
PS2 battlefront, both one and two were pretty much the top games of my childhood, still enjoy them to this day.
Omg thank you Russian Badger! I was having such a sh&t day at work then I see this and you just brightened my day!
Cringe
Bread
Im a deathtrooper
Badger: "this game is straight up broken and unfair, the company that makes it has abandoned it, we only made this video because my friends are cool and mods are funny"  Me: "hmm, that still looks pretty cool, maybe I should get it"
when he said "I hope george lucas never sees this" I thought oh it can't be that bad. the very next second I heard "you better not take my monkey camel." forget lucas, I'm choking on my own tounge.
In the sponsor segment of this video badger is like one blob or hair gel away from having that supervillain hair cut
(unsubs) DON'T YOU DARE TALK S### ABOUT KIRBY
How does he make this like wow that amazing
The movie is in fact coming out.
I would pay good money to see a star wars movie about a stormtrooper squad with badgers crew playing all the characters
10:29  11:00 POV : You commit tax evasion and the IRS is on your door step and you ask who is at the door
Bannakin
Too late ep 9 already killed it
13:42 RussianBadger has become the Green Goblin
9:46 (radios command of clone war era) BOOMER
I am a fellow sellacious enthusiast
bananakin skywalker
I love that side eye jaba gives
Never thought I'd hear "Kirby just clapped Mauls cheeks"
"Hello Ma-" BONK
it doesn't auto aim your just good
One second In my screen decides no you're going to watch a video in 2001 100p quality
Bananakin Skywalker
"Kirby's just clapped Maul's cheeks"  damn
9:00 I just saw a video about them continuing filming for the movie in January 2023 and immediately thought of this part.
I haven't played in a while but I remember death troopers being absurd
Well that alec baldwin bit aged…. Weirdly.
I mean... Blowing up a planet can solve almost all of its problems, its solves world hunger, over population, planetary wast, I can go on and on
Banan
like goku from fortnite?
2:28
What do you use to make the ideas?
He talking mad tough about Salacious Crumb when Max Rebo just sittin there vibing
Lol wtf 🤣 🤣 🤣
The only time a actually watched the sponsor the animations are holden
10:44-10:56 basically tf2
Ok how have I only just discovered this channel? YouTube recombination sucks
Bananakain peelwalker
I love how he pulled one of scorch's voice lines from republic commando, he is a true star wars nerd
You know you fuck up when they call master chief
there are private servers with modded multiplayer now
You know the bit is gonna be “like Goku from Fortnite”
13:52 execute order 66
16:13 is the best part
10:30 Jedi in disguise: Hello empi- me a trooper: No (fires blaster). Random new trooper member: Jesus Christ. 6:25 ey when we nuking the planet to fix our problem boys. 9:22 hope it was the tf2 sound effect the DUDUDUDUUU. 9:25 tf2 domination gunshot jump scare. 2:12 the rum kicking in.
13:53 *"Good soldiers follow orders."*
10:50 he literally just described tf2
10:31 THAT. THAT. i am just repeating that over and over, NEVER GONNA GET OLD
bruh the HNNG WIFE got me and the heavenly humming too HOLY SHIT
2:24 gave me a damn flashback to the original battlefronts on the OG Xbox.
Smi77y group v badger group on rainbow six make it happen boy's
No one can change my mind that the first order and the clones have the best drip
I love the absolutely randomness of these videos. Cracks me up all the time
i just realized that the signal calibration sceen has mando'a on it. i think its gibberish but if anyone knows how to read mando'a then please help. i can just read aurebesh.
4:32 I've never actually seen Badger's face, he looks nothing like he sounds
In the words of the death trooper: gwgaujaagagjajakekakja
1:12 *cheeks*
I downloaded a mod that turns Anakin into Kit Fisto. That was the only mod I was running. I just wanted to play as my favorite Jedi and EA banned my ass real quick.
Heavenly: What do you have a fake gun? My answer: yes they all have fake guns cause if they were real, that's a ban and the Star war franchise will never continue. Edit: I'm not trying to be rude, I just thought it would be you know, looking on the bright side.
8:40,
Atf can die.
Weed is not illegal. It never was.
if only this game introduced galactic conquest I'd buy it right now.
Someone:*hacks* EA:I sleep Someone:*plays online forgetting they have a mod installed* EA:U WOT M8
The game was ass at launch. They made it worse. Now it is completely unplayable. Servers suck on console, class balance is nonexistent. Even the map rotation is fucking retarded. I get the same 2 maps every fucking game.
I need a photoshop of badger working at McDonald’s
Happy belated birthday Badger!!
Dude, you have made me laugh so much that you probably extended my lifespan. Please don't stop, you are one of the greatest.
badgers has the crumb drip
yeh bit my level 96 heavy is basically a hero at this point
Considering what Disney has done to Star Wars I think Lucas will give you a pass.
Fun fact: citizens actually liked the stormtroopers more than clones because stormtroopers werent belligerent and they actually helped others citizens with problems while clones would be belligerent and would only actually be on the planet when they went drinking or if they were coruscant guards
The animation and quality of this video is insane. Extremely well done
Half the vid was just Badger simping over Selacious B Crumb
3:54 white man jumpscare
Everything in Star Wars being super protected and maintained  Man remember that when they weren’t trying to make a thousand shows that take place before a new hope and don’t care what canon they break in the process
We need a office like tv show taking place on the death star. Staring these mfs
What a great fuckin' channel to find bruh
Dey pud da madder chief in the star wars
Whats the name of the one guy from that meme hes playing an entire band by him self
And then there is Disney.
I hate to say this. Compared to what EA and Disney did to Stat Wars. You guys can only IMPROVE the franchise by making it FUN. Then, again recently EA lost the exclusive rights to making Star Wars video games. Soooo...we can only hope for better content. Even George Lucas didn't even show up to the Premier of the last Star Wars movie Disney pumped out. 🙄 So you can't do any worse. Other than piss off Disney Trademark and Copyright Lawyers the two beings in the galaxy that no Sith or Jedi would ever want to fuck with.
ahhhh and the sounds of old battlefront II in the background
He be proud...........Disney would be pissed
The most baffling part of this is still the fact that there are places where credit and debit cards are not issued by banks, but by private corporations.
10:13 isn't that just current tf2
Ever played the Ewok hunt game mode?
what the hell kinda sponsor deal is "we're giving you 12G but you gotta spend a couple hundred on some shit to show that a fucking debit card works, in case there's doubt"  *goes full send on Salacious B. Crumb merch*
Skippy life
Who else agrees that badger is aligned with neutral evil
2:10 Anakin Bananikin
Soup
This guy is the definition of crumb
I'm starting to think Badger likes Salacious Crumb
As a passionate star wars fan, I was scared I was gonna cry about how Badger and his gang butchers the franchise like they always do. I am not disappointed.
Bro got money from current and spent the money on selacious crumb with current
Run from it...Dread it...THE MEMES ALWAYS ARRIVE
Jabba the pizza hutt

"I may be dipshit dumpster trash with all lightsaber heroes" You and me both pal. I'm not good with lightsaber heroes either. I prefer to stick with my blaster heroes thank you very much. When I use a lightsaber hero I feel like I'm the guy that stupidly brought a knife to a gun fight.
Imagine getting tackled by a 6'4" half tonne hunk of solid metal of the super rocket battle droid
Okay, that Alec Baldwin crack earned you a subscriber.
This reminds me of the good old days of playing modded Jedi Knight 2 on PC
banana
This is good content. And he gets paid to shitpost all day. And Hero hogging makes the game boring to me. I rarely get to play heros even if I have the most points in beginning cause I won't kill myself immediately to get hero.
M          M        M        M       M        M
Bananakin
I hope he makes a Team fortress 2 video
Did you upgrade your engine? Also holy shit badjur best v tuber
Heavy can beat any non-hero in a 1v1, change my mind
banakin skywalker is awsome
0:13 Like Goku from Fortnite
Skin the jet packer as kool-aid man
The real sponsor of this video is Salacious B. Crumb
8:53-9:15  Considering that the FBI confirmed that Alec Baldwin did in fact pull the trigger to shoot the gun and it did not malfunction, the bit is even funnier
Any bro knows what the clown music at the very end is ??
I seen every single original Star Wars movie they are better than the new ones
badger needs to try the original battlefront 2 from 2005 change my mind
Man that BF4 bop tho
3:51 Ah payday 2
10:29 - Hello M-
God I wish I had a friend group like this hehe. God I'm lonely
TIL, Badger’s married.
red trooper = oh no i spilled ketchup on myself
I love the OG BF2 (2005) sounds, it's like getting Vietnam flashbacks.
I counted that u used about 53 different cameras in ur suit thingy
Something something bananas and radioactive poisoning... but I'm not sure that's your biggest worry this time
@TheRussianBadger Skulker forgot to say "Like Master Chief from fortnite?"
Can we talk about how each time he switched the camera, it would play the sound form the original sound form BF2 when you choose where you want to spawn?
Do ewok hunt
you have yet to do a tf2 video
I want to reinstall the game now, its a Miracle
Bananakin Skywalker 😂
agents at current are watching his buy history and saying "oh its just badger, as you can see because he just getting crumbs merch"
bru do STRAY!
Salacious B. Crumb
Darth Lucas will never see it he is dead
You know anybody else watching this while they're taking a shit

cloaker and death trooper be like: my guy!!!
Ima watching this in the car. *just like the simulations*
8:30
Bro it’s bananacinSkywalker
Salacious Crumb sounds like an old school rapper's name. I love it.
9:37
Hey badger u know that there is a coop mode where u and 3 of ur buddies hold or attack an objective from ai bots
POV badger still uses red dot
You need to do the old Star Wars battlefront
8:55 Alec Baldwin jokes.
God if this video was released when Darth Vader was in the battle pass
7:30 free da rugrat
I love this video, btw I am blind 8n my left eye
NOT BANANAKIN WEEDWALKER
Damn use the heavy mobile turret is op as hell
I have been waiting to see badger animate tf2. It would be so great if he did.
When the credit card is star wars colored😳
During the Fortnite bit I wanted to rip out every organ out of my body
FUCKING MODING MY FAV GAME AHHHHHHHHHH BRAIN OVERLOAD

"Yeah, I'm gonna go drink a gallon of *RAT POISON.* I'll be right b- (User Disconnected.)"  Absolutely got me.
10:29 hello ma-
Bananakin Skywalker
8:46
Use arc trooper if you like sith trooper
Oh my god, just as with the last Battlefront video, I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time. Badger, you're the best.
Famous words 'C'MERE REY, I'M BOUTTA TURN YOU INTO A FUCKEN HOT POCKET. WHILE YOU'RE FIGHTING KYLO REN.'
10:31 JORGE
Such good content, who knew battlefront was fun any more 🤣
therapist: bananakin skywaker isnt real, he cant hurt you  bananakin skywaker:
I don’t think I could play with mods knowing I’m gambling with my account badgers just built different
Bruh you should have made yoda into mike Wezowski
6:50 I solved the homeless problem by executing all the homeless people.

Of corse Ohio leagalized weed

No one said Bananakin Skywalker, and I’m very disappointed. Aside, great video.
2:11 Yo is that motherfucking bananakin skywalker
Bananakin Potassiumwalker has to be my favourite Star Wars character.
Why you be looking like Carl Azuz. CNN trans rights looking mother***
Honestly, demonizing badger is probably the worst thing you can do due to his view count, because then you got ALOT of gamers who aren’t going to be very happy that he can’t punt any more baby yodas.
Galactic empire is the best rebel team change my mind
I legit can’t tell if this is vr or an animation
I wanna know what happened to the guy at 16:03
This was the first video from Badger I saw,and when I saw how amazing the animation was and how funny and meme-filled his videos were,I was hooked.Absolute CHAD of a youtuber.
The Star Wars blaster sound effect is made by a high tension steel cable.
TheRussianBadger makes me pay attention to sponsor ships
Finally... I have reached my true potential... as a Skywalker
Solve cancer by blowing up the world
bananakin
Never thought I'd see the day when Bananakin Skywalker joins the chat😂😂😂
Bager let's play VR together. I love your videos and I think the best moment in my gaming career would be playing one round with you
i remember one time me and my friends were talkin about star wars and the topic of jabas hutt came up. everyone went "oh yeah you remember that laughing guy that hung with jaba?", and i dead ass thought about it for a sec, trying to remember who they were talkin about, and about 10 seconds later, i said "oh yeah i remember him. crumbopulous j gooch." to this day, it is still an inside joke of ours
TheRussianBadger and crew are just living shitposts and literally everyone loves it.
omg storm trumper shoots hello mario 10:30
Someone send me a Lifesize figure of rey so I can flambe the fuck out of her?
Congrata bro u got new sub
Man simps so hard for salacious crumb, prolly cause he looks like him
I'm so glad you find sponsors that pretty much just say "yeah, its fine, just mention us." so you can make these kinds of videos.
you know it's bad when all the people that he said from fortnite or actually in fortnite
Give up bananakin I have the monster  You underestimate my potassium master
10:29 hello- *dies*
What's with crum!!!!!!!
Anyone else here a girl say heavenly are you done playing
2:11
I always forget that Djuj Bellis is still a bot name in Battlefront 2, it was in 1 and the first time me and my brother saw it he just yelled out JUJU BELLS and that has been his name ever since
I'd love to see a star wars spin-off (Lion King 1.5 style) where it's just Badger and friends shitposting across the trilogies.
I absolutely love all of your group, you have helped me through depression more than 1 time and I would just like to say thanks
Wait a minute, Badger has a wife?
You should do a battlefront 2 video on starfighter assault and vechivals in general
6:17
“This video is sponsored by Current!” 1 second later: 💀
5:41 The banning of the flamethrower during ww2: 1941 colourised
TF2 video when, there were simply too many references in this one  I liked how the fire after the Rey scene had the one second of crit particles and electricity sound.  Cmonnnn you could get at least 10 videos out of it  Mann Vs Machine!?
I love how in almost any video badger can just say something that would normally get the video demonitized and because he has a sponsee he literally says fuck YouTube statistics and say and do whatever he wants and gets away with it,it kinda feels like he’s cheating god if god was YouTube
He’s from the original Star Wars
3:08
Saber time, Maguire!
You and the homies ruining the Star Wars franchise?! Disney is way ahead of you in that department, Mandalorian and Obi Wan Kenobi aside.
The empire is your favorite???????? Certified based
i just pressed the right arrow for a bit and i just heard "this video is SPIDERMAN"
I’ve seen it
8:23 POV: you're a door to door salesman in Chicago.
To be fair, Disney destroyed Star Wars more completely and effectively than you guys ever could. At least when you guys "destroy" it, it's funny and not mean-spirited.
Welcome back to another edition of me and the Homies ruining the Star Wars Franchise  Mr. Mouse: first time? (Iconic Laugh)
In the first two minutes and eleven seconds (0:00 - 2:11) there’s twenty-eight different camera changes…  *what.*   Edit: it’s been a year since this video came out?   *what.*   Edit 2:   I’m surprised Badger didn’t download the thicc Leia mod   *what.*
People we want weed Texas got it more guns
Bruh. Imagine a star wars series of Badger and his friends just being shit posting storm troopers
You can also add other characters
y'all should play Kyber servers
This is corner, but I can do this shit with Vantage West my guy except for the fees part using the ATMs
Scout Trooper is hot. Change My Mind.
Fuck the Death Troopers. The B-2 and Clone Commando are where it’s at for enforcers
the atf thing my uncle and his dog could relate.if they were alive
" this game is 4 years old, full of bugs, and completely abandoned by the developers" why the fuck is he describing titanfall 2 in a battlefront 2 video
TLDW: Salacious B. Crumb
It's over bannanakin I have the high ground
Bananakin is legitimately the best thing I have ever heard🤣🤣🤣
Make elden ring video
Omg the Bananakin 🤣
Literally Anyone else: Haha funny video badger. Me; *Downloading roms to my twice jailbroken 2ds xl* Huh? you added mods, well good for you ig.
Bananakin skywalker
Heavenlys not actually doing that bad, right?...
Guys i think he likes Salacious Crumb
Banakin skywalker
Put bully Maguire in here as a sith and have him say I'm gonna put dirt in your eye
The AK-47, officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova, is a gas-operated assault rifle that is chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnik-  Oh sorry, wrong classroom.
I love watching these feature films thinking to myself, so many millions of people are missing out
hEy BaDgEr wHy Do YoU nOt TrY tO lIvE StReaM oN yOuTuBE??
0:15 like Jesus from Fortnite?
Badger gamersups bussing
10:30 saving this for later don't mind me
I don’t have a left eye…
half this video is intro
Oh sure. You only have a disagreement with genocide when it brings unemployment to zero. But any other time you support the empire and Caesars legion
Bring me on. No reason.
Is it still P2W?
Salacious B. Crumb
13:06
The POV cam looks like a BONEWORKS POV
No the death rate goes up
One thing I'm just now noticing is that he's not using a battlefront scout trooper model. That model is from Jedi Fallen Order
Yo this guy has a GUN! No SHIT we ALL have GUNS! No THIS guy had a REAL GUN! What do YOU have a FAKE GUN??!!
If u blow up a planet the rate of death goes to 100 for a second
badger's married?
This is quality content
9th 9 ecxra
Bro posts once in a blue moon
Yo boomer juice tastes good but it hits hard
ayo! as someone who IS Blind in my left eye.... that was a weird thing to hear outta nowhere lol
Like earth Vader… from fortnite
Imagine when he figures out that you can unlock crumb in the new Lego Star Wars game
the worst part is they just added Indiana Jones and Darth Vader
This is not the Battlefield 2 you're looking.
You, your editing, and your friends are so funny :D
yo there's a stim crate there at the intro
As a Star Wars fan, this makes me happy, instead of angry. I’m happy to see people can still have fun with Star Wars, even though the recent movies weren’t very well received. Also I know Salacious Crumb. Am I cool now?
When the entirety of badger's Death Trooper homing shit sequence is bot kills except for one
Didn’t know badger was married
They were right about spider man in Fortnite
They changed the death troopers weapon to the E-11D
BADGERS MARRIED?!?!?!
Bananakin Skywalker
I love badger even more now #masterchief my guy
I would absolutely love to jump back into Battlefront 2, but since I decided to change the email on my EA account, they SOMEHOW think I made a completely new account and YOINKED ALL OF MY PROGRESS for Battlefront 2 and took the two Force Awakens skins from the Deluxe Edition.  Oh, and they took all my Battlefield 4 progress as well. Six years of dedication....gone  Thanks EA :')
I got a star wars game ad, AND I DIDNT SEE SPIDER MANNNNNNNNNNNN
11:56 - 12:20 Lorentz driver in PvP on launch
Everyone gangsta until they see a UNSC Pelican come into action:
Finally I am not alone in my love for the man, the myth, the legend, Salacious B. Crumb
i loved the sith trooper and the gun it used was my fav gun that i had used before in battlefront 2015
Whats the text on the bottom of the screen say at 0:40?
You know when you’ve played a lot of tf2 when a man wearing a shit ton of hats makes you actually think “yo he must be some rich trader or shit”
BRO your intros and 3D animation work with the tracking gear are getting so good xD
its master fucking chief! halo parts 2:23 2:28 14:05 14:11 14:15
Y’all see glup shitto too?
Somebody tell Badger about the Kyber servers. I wanna see his perspective on it
nothing wrong with putting bots in games to make people more active
I feel only pain
Wait are there no level 300 bumming you in pc?
“Hey I’m just saying they bring a lot of jobs to the Community. 2:49 I don’t they employ Salacious Crumb and I like it when he laughs”. 2:56
Imagine how fucking amazing this hame would be if it had a good studio behind it and wasnt left to die a slow death by developers. A game being this broken and shit still managing to even have the potential to be funny ahhh if only it wasnt EA
Glad this game became popular again, I used to play the shit out of it on my PS2 when I was younger.
5:40 I got the same feeling from this as I did watching Thanos punch Captain Marvel: unadulterated joy
A Jedi Fallen Order run through would be really cool to see, it is a really fun game
Selatios crumb
It also turns the homelessness number down to 0
Now I REALLY want to see a comedy short of Russianbadger squad as a rebel soldiers in actual in universe Canon star wars 😂
Yo, wait.  Ashoka Tano mod?
This game is fun
The amount of time put into these vids is insane.
IT'S ALL CRUMBS (4:01)
Bananakin Skywalksr
Ok this is pretty good but those Alec Baldwin jokes were in extremely poor taste.
Was that heavenlys mom??????? 9:16
I didn't even think that little creature had a name.  And the commercial for the card helps to explain why the guy has been awol for a while.
14:50 i wanna know a banana lightsaber crystal would look like
This is tf2 the sequel
Smiderman 👍👍👍👍👍
And you’re the only one getting smoked
they are going to finish the rust movie it's on the news maybe they changed their mind reply if they finally grew a brain and binned the whole movie
IT'S MASTER FUCKING CHIEF 🤣😃🤣😃🤣
xD wish I had a crew like yours
2:10 It's Bananakin Skywalker.
Bro I'd turn rei into a hot pocket
Yo. I joined the discord.. shared like 4 memes and was banned from the server.. no warnings issued by the mods as per protocol.. 🥺 so I have no idea what it was I posted that crossed a line 😰
moar star wars battlefront needed badge
Me: A giant fan who loved the first Battlefront II video. "...I Mean... Yeah"
Perfectly  Maintained Star Wars Universe  *screams in before Disney outrage*
You might wanna try the Kyber private servers cos you can have all this fun with mods without EA banning your account.
Menuh bill up widuh weed Induh Nork Joisy😈😈😈🤩🤩🤩🤩🤪☹️🥺🥺🥺😩🥵🥵🥵🥵😳🤔🤭😦😧🙄🤫🖕
This video is sponsored by current tell more about that in 2 minutes... Spider-Man
That’s a nice Current card, can I see what the back looks like?
gonna be honest. I'd love to see a series that's tv-14 just badger and the crew who's all stormtroopers just arguing about stupid shit in the star wars universe and in the empire.
Badger“If you fund me buying monkey merch I’ll tell people about you” Current”alright”
Im suprised that badger is married. das crazy bro
3:50 isn't it weird that most banks in Poland offer that stuff for free anyway (at least if you're under 26)
With that many reasons in your first video I feel like you just decided to forgo pushing the envelope and just make a paper airplane out of it and yeet the dang thing
i found this channel like 2 days ago and im addicted
This is the first video that have seen of this guy, the quality of this video is gold. Kudos to this guy
7:26 pretty sure the universe did everything in its power to stop that from happening, you found a way
Pause at 6:27 and you'll see S U S
Badger when talking about the sith troopers action:"aw, thats so cool! Aw thats so awesome"  Me:"i know right? Just like in the movie when... *OH WAIT* "
If you think death trooper is broken you should’ve seen pre patch Wookiee or pre patch heavy
Are you really in vr or is it edited
Glad I watched this good shit it actually got me back into Battlefront 2
When you did thr sout outs, I accidentally went back to the 'because the first order is based' part and I was like are those bitches part of the first order?
Badger and co: Surely with such a tight grip on modding we won't see anything TOO weird. Bananakin Skywalker:
Fucking heavy class is goated
Gotta say, that’s a really good green goblin voice
I imagine Badger and his friends being Clones during Order 66 but instead of being forced to kill Jedi against their will, they are ready and willing and start laughing each time they succeed while doing stupid shit.
I was dying at banakin
tbh "the more mods a game has the more shit the game is"
Seeing Glamrock Freddy come in all appalled and just... "No!" made my day.
straight up imagining you all in star wars makes me think of red vs blue
this video isn't bad, but like there's only two minutes of anything funny/gameplay
I hope badger plays republic commando
I have ad skip and I just hear "this video is sponsored by SPIDER-MAN"
why is it legal to use marijuana for medical use in ANY state?
do GMOD
YouTube also demonetized a YouTuber for making fun of hobbits
I honestly can’t tell if they love or hate this game
Badger has a wife?
Love how these guys sponsor Badger so he can keep making these videos since YouTube makes no sense anymore with what they allow and don't allow nowadays
40,000 ATMs in the whole country? Oh wow, that's like... 13 per county. Homie thats a whole trip just to pull out cash for the club
Guys. Bananakin Skywalker?
``I find your lack of maturety disturbing´´
The best part about Badger callin master chief a Jedi is that they have lightsabers in Fortnite and you could totally beat someone’s ass as master Chief using Mace Windu’s saber
Kirby just clapped mauls cheeks
You should play tf2
BADGER NEW STAR WARS GAME HAS YA BOI salacious b crumb as a playable character.
Mofo using the 2003 battlefront 2 menu sound
Disney fucked the star wars universe not you . you just made it fun again.
What a great and hilarious video
“The most protected series ever”  Me: uh have you seen what Disney has done as of late
I appreciate Badger at times.   Badger: Shoots kermit  Kermit: Fucking dies   Badger: Shoots Chief   Chief: Shrugs it off as if it didn't even happen
I would get these mods if my game didnt run like a fucling slideshow
Desperatly need a Soviet Womble/Russian Badger crossover
Honestly this just makes me miss the ridiculous bullshit I got up to in Jedi Academy multi.
Finally a youtuber who makes me laff
i agree with what youre saying, but your youtube channel is basically Reddit The Youtube channel, this was so cringe to watch. but it got you a lot of views so keep making that money
If you’re confident enough in your product to get badger to promote it then it’s probably worth buying.
Why do you talk so much like 5 minutes
2:12 "I haven't even touched the rum yet. Why is Skywalker a banana?" Absolutely amazing. XD
For anyone wondering, thing that is written in 0:36 on bottom of vid is 1. Mandolorian writing. 2. After translating a few letters, it sounds like gibberish rather then normal english words.
"you guys gave me a POV camera" proceeds to not use it
Badger, you are the G.O.A.T nobody can beat you. You're immortal
Idk why but the ending but where he was just walking around with the music felt really wholesome.
Give them fat sweat sweat 4.0M
I have sponsor block and the start of the video literally went "This video is sponsored by SPIDERMAN" and I love it.
5:00 **Well that didnt age so well**
the og SWBF II selection sound when he's switching camera angles in the intro is PHENOMENAL
Anyone know the model for badgers wife? Just asking for a friend
“It’s been abandoned by the developer, but when the lasers start firing it’s still something special” TF|2 in a nutshell
this is a sin towards GOD
love the real battlefront 2 sound effects
People talking about how weed needs to be legalized  Me: *Laughs In Coloradan*
did u take a fat dab in the intro XD
The “I’m a death trooper” line is the funniest thing I’ve seen for so long
Wait untill you see Garden Warfare 2 with mods on PC, because the game isn't supported anymore, you won't get banned for that crap, which is why you see cheating in multiplayer alot more there, and those people suck
See I don't play the named heroes, only reinforcements
this video is really funny lmao
badger question. What was your highest kill streak? also, I would like to try a 1v1 please
Bro Im be 100 with u g that hair line gotta go😬
That fucking "Reeech"-guy. Literally everytime I play the game I see him in my lobby and now he's even here in the video. This dude literally doesn't play any other game than Battlefront 2!
Just played Battlefront for my first time It’s great
Dude theres now private servers that  support mods called kiber servers
This vid is sponsored by the card man called current
The only troopers that can aim
No damn way I just got a commercial for Fortnite with sabers and the star wars crossover
This is so boring show some effing gameplay. Trying to hard.
Another class video my dude
15:49 WAIT I RECOGNISE THAT CHARACTER, AHHHHH WHO IS THAT FEMALE CHARACTER
that alec baldwin bit aged like milk bro
I couldn't stop laughing at 6:37 for like five minutes.
Who watching this may the 4th 2022?
Oh yeah, everyone gangsta when you kill them with a fucking flame thrower but when you whip out the 1911 it’s a fucking war crime?
The multiverse makes this video cannon, and since Disney owns both star wars and marvel, it’s even more cannon
Did anyone else hear at 9:17 the heavenly are you OK by someone.
you should try the lego mods for bf2
Just marry crumb already
i need the link to this mod
Lemme tell you, the instant action mods are fucken BALLER.
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance when?
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance when?
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance when?
BE THE 4TH WITH YOU
on xbox no hack but troopers alone i saw kill Darth Vader one time and it was me i was going to be dead but troopers op af in xbox star wars bf2 >)
4:00 my man’s look like a fucking movie villain for no reason to me
Banakin skywalker 😂
Saying that star wars lore is meticulously maintained convinced me that a good take is impossible on this channel
What is the song he used for the calibration in progress at 1:05 called
battle front on the ps2 was the best ngl
Lol DOOM REFERENCE
I'm happy to tell you badger you made me cheer up after a dream where my cat disappeared and we got a new one but I didn't know where the original is :)
EA the kinda company to ban you for talking about slaves in a universe where Jabba The Hutt feeds slaves to a rancor for fun
Amazing animations
2:11 bananakin
"So meticuously maintained Lore, characters to the attention to detail" He says after the Sequels were made LMFAO YEAH RIGTH
*in Halo voice* KILLAMANJARO

I never touched the Death Trooper until his first BF II video, now I have maxed out star cards and it's all I use, now time for the Sith Trooper. Also, hearing "Bananakin Skywalker" literally made me spit out my Mountain Dew, funniest thing I've ever heard
Wait badger has a wife?
I play it on and off and the balance issue is real. I remember a year or so ago, I could rack up 30 kills like it was nothing. Now, you get one tapped from 4000 ft away like it's hardcore mode in CoD. Apparently Co-Op vs AI is the mode to play.
SIGN ME THE FUCK UP
Okay, now i am really curious, RussianBadger and Co. vs Recreyo, who wins?
Huh, looks and sounds like a funny good time.
Just make a Stormtrooper Show that's just Russian Badger and his gang dealing with day to day Starwars shenanigans in the Empire lol
play the co-op mode no hackers
Battlefront 2 is such a fun mess, it's completely unbalanced but still so fun.
For anyone wondering, EA actually fixed the 1hp bug. I was playing for about 3 hours the other day hopping into different servers on multiple game modes and had no issues
My favorite Star Wars character...  Kirby.
15:46 . What fuckin anime or game is this woman from?
I mean ive killed more vaders with heavies thanother heros so i dont rlly get how you guys cant get death fone
Can we make battlefront 2 like a thing on this channel
"SIGN ME THE FUCK U-" >gets interrupted by a Star Wars mobile game ad
Best quote in shooter history...  "Oh, no! This guy got a GUN!"
You can’t spell simple without the word SIMP.
more battlefront 2 pls
I swear 2:12 is hilarious due to questioning yourself what the hell is happening
Star wars battlefront 2 does not need mods
Badger on the FO JumpTrooper  Me: He Flies Now Badger: I Fly Now
@gorge Lukas
Wasn't your last bf2 video sponsored?
Badgers SW battlefront videos  have the same energy as Robot chickens  stop motion star wars shorts and im in love with it.
Death Star has 6 billion jobs, Alderann has 2 billion people.  Net positive of good enough.
Master Chief? More like Master Chef
That's a kool shot, yeah,, with a K, as in "Kool-aid"
Op looks like salacious crumm
BADGER IS MARRIED?
Who's the guy with subtitles cyan/blue
RussianBadger says something a little bad Youtube: No Mcnasty says something terrible Youtube: That's alright
2 minutes of actual gameplay in a 16 minute video 😂
g mod video as soon as you get the possibility
9 year old: hey its the guy from fortnite everybody else: he's to lost
I hate and love how I have to keep rewatching this shitpost of a channel, that I love, just to get my next badger high just so I can wait for the next video.
*CHUCKELS IN SALACIOUS B CRUMB*
my man got sponcered by a credit card
This is why I wake up. It's so perfect🤌🤌🤌🤌 Also, I fucking love u badger.
Dey put damaster chef in the sodah
sus
I fr gotta find I way to befriend Badger and Co These mfs make every game fun  I try the same games and wanna kill myself because I have like 2 friends that do that.
"you're too late Spiderman! weed has been legalised!!" "yeah well you're the one getting smoked Gobby!! *pulls out AK*
Kk
0:26 I like how you replaced your usual gunshots with blaster sounds for this video.
MoNkEy CaMeL
Badger: "Welcome back to another great edition of me and the homies ruining the Star Wars franchise"?  You clearly haven't wachted ep. 7 - 9, Solo and The Book of Bobba Fett, huh?
Yes BANANAKIN very good video
idk if anyone would see this, but I keep getting into empty lobbies when I try playing. Is there a way to fix this or is this normal
Still better than the sequels. Depressing as that is...
Three words: GOLDEN ARCH HAIRLINE
All I’m saying is that, if any of these guys had their house broken into streaming; they’d have better come strapped cause this entire squad sits an arsenal next to their monitors.
7:02 everything except Mortality Rates, but meh.
This is better than all of the sequel movies.
Turn off the volume when badger is explaining shit and watch this video it's funny as hell
Where can I watch the real game video and does he have a twitch if so please what
did you use a jedi fallen order model? just wondering
This is the best editing I’ve ever seen well done!
What makes the demonetization even more stupid is that YouTube literally has Star Wars episode 6 for Buy or Rent.
13:16 proof that Badger and co. share one brain cell between them. While they normally play hot potato with it, sometimes they just pile on.
BORNANA
Badger I just burnt ten ewoks like the crispy chicken britches they are this is your issue now
fun fact: death troopers have voice scramblers, so only the troopers could understand eachother
I wish that game wasn’t so dead, I would be down to play it if the devs cared
i am quite literally downloading bf2 as i watch this dumbass fucking video my lord help me now
I wanna see Badger play TF2
no people=no unemployment
Badger knew Salacious actual species name hes valid valid
what does the b stand for?
The first person to hit the dumpster his arm was flinging around
Badger in the new lego Star Wars salacious b crumb is a playable character
6:24 was my favorite part of this video! XD
the sponsor ads are the best things about his videos lol
Bananakin
Seeing imperial stormtroopers with real-world firearms is a bit cursed
"The last time we played battlefront 2 I was demonetized" Is that supposed to stop me from watching the video or something
Guys, I’m not sure, but I think this guy likes Salacious B Crumb.
damn, this game looks fun! *buys the game* huh, thats weird the servers are down, im sure it will be fine later :D *later* alright lets join a game, *quick join* you join a server with a singular lvl 350 player
9:14
Just asking, will you be banned for using the bananakin mod?
Acr trooper has the right click ability aswell
i like how youtube is like "bro your content is not appropriate" badge "who .. the fuck cares"
6:13  I'd love to see a Star Wars spin off series focusing on Stormtroopers voiced by Badger and friends
Your videos made really happy
Ah yes, I love the video game Which Fucking Camera.
No wonder the empire is understaffed most of them were glassed on Yavin-4
gasoline and peanut butter would  probably make napalm
What a hot take, a garbage game is still fun with friends. Who knew. Meanwhile DRG is actually fun and a fantastic game all on it's own. Give Deep rock galactic a try it is worth your time way more than any cheap shitty cash grab from a soulless corporation like EA
I would really like to see badger and the klan of yes to play tf2
"No way it's a fucken kool-aid jammer trooper!"
6:50 - This sounds like the kind of thing you'd hear in the background coming from a group of troopers who are on break or in their quarters off-shift.
Master Chief vs The First Order What will he do?
Spider Man and Master Chief I expected. But Kirby Yoda. KIRBY?! YODA!?
i wonder how long it takes for him to make these absolute master pieces
When are you gonna upload badger
Glad to see you didn't get cancelled for the alec baldwin jokes. There is hope for this world
The therussianbadger be like: Welcome to, what camera should we be looking at like, do we really need so many cameras for this dips**t intro like, 1, 2, 3 ,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, you can even be a POV cam WTF
I like how Badger uses tf2 stuff and as a tf2 player with 1300+ hours I can say that he uses tf2 stuff very well, an example in this video is: something near the start of the video -9:26 the domination sound  -
Play TF2
Never in my 25 years of life did I ever think Kirby, Master Chief, Bannanakin Skywalker, Star Wars, and “packing heat like Alec Baldwin” would ever be in the same video and still be funny.
This guy def put a lot of work in his vids and I love that but it’s really the content for like the weird autistic stereotype band kids. Still love the work this guy puts
I just wonder what shit badger would pull off in a souls game.
This games graphics still hold up very well today
Watch me be the only one to recognize the MStar poster at 8:19
It's over bananakin I have the high ground 😂
I can’t believe I got an ad on a therussianbadger
My therapist: Bananakin isn’t real, he can’t hurt you.  Bananakin: 2:10
Badger EA did the impossible. They fixed the 1hp glitch.
huh. there is over 100x more likes than dislikes
the fact that the master chief mod even made it master chief in the star cards bro
Badger kill himself in every video meow
I wouldn’t say it’s protected anymore after the new movies lol
You should have a second channel called the Prussian badger
The Star Wars movie we never got, but wished existed. Those tactics though Kylo using the force and a random Storm trooper toasting the enemy with a flamethrower.
13:25 He doesn't even acknowledge how close he came to having that clip ruined by the oblivious Darth Maul. EDIT: This is also proof that he plays with paid actors, a hero class ignored him.
Bro, can someone see if that Mando'a translates to anything?
1:19 “GREGORY. DO YOU SEE THIS MESSAGE FROM PALPATINE?” “YOU NEED TO EXECUTE ORDER 66, GREGORY. KILL ALL JEDI.”
I need a montage of all the times a gun has been racked in your videos, its egregious as shit and I love it
I see title, I think "Is it the good Battlefront 2 or the bad Battlefront 2" It was the bad Battlefront 2
The empire strikes wack
I never felt so proud of my self for watching a RussianBadger video before YouTube demonised it.
Funny how a game that almost nobody cares about anymore still has better moderation than roblox
BanAnakin Skywalker!
Deathtrooper, more like Deathcloaker
6:09 that ray tracing tho
0:05😂😂
I could watch an hour and a half video about how this guy and his friends tried garlic bread
Bananakin skywalker…
Must be nice being married to Asuka
I imagine this is what Deadpool would be like as a Twitch streamer...
if master cheif is lando then i am all for it (lando main here and i am actually decent with a gun hero somehow)
Bananakin Skywalker
new player picks up the death trooper : I AM THE HARBINGER
Rewatching this made me re install Battlefront 2 lmao
what's the kill feed sound?
Badger look liked he was dancing when he was pointing where the cameras were lol
Funny monke lizard go haha
Bananiken Skywalker
"ITS OVER BANANAKIN... I GOT MASTERCHEIF FROM FORTNITE"
Just become a bf2 player this video was based
unemployment -> extermoutause
3:26
How did you make the intro
I keep forgetting this mf has a face
Waitwaitwait… you worked in finance? Your telling me I could’ve gotten my taxes down by THE russianbadger?
i agree free tayk
Badger no cap should play l4d2 vs with friends and fans jus sayin dawg
The guns in the game shoot pillows
Played this the other day on console. Surprised to see the number of full games within the couple hours I was on.
I love how skulker is aggressively walking to Connor going like “THATS MY BIT. NOT YOURS.”
Bananakin
You're too late Spiderman! Weed had been legalized
Aw yes, space viet nam truly is a legit horror experience
They added the fucking Republic Commandos? …I might need to play this now…
bruh u made me buy the game on sale and then hate myself for not buying bfbc2
12:25 cloaker momento??
Why do I think if they played master duel it would be the weirdest game I have ever seen
Wait, the guacamole gamer fart man got a wife? I have no god dam excuse then
Loved bananakin
Should a 13 year old be watching this?
Lol it's bananakin Skywalker
this video has enlightened me to yobama
Haha, Bananakin
Bold of you to think that the lore of the star wars universe is as maintained as you think it is. Before Disney bought Lucasfilm, there was some wild shit going on in the lore. Trust me. What you have done in this game don't even come close. Endor is weirder than you could ever believe. They got a crying mountain. Not even joking.
15:45 🤣🤣🤣
Battlefront 2 abandoned by the Developers but they will still ban you for Mods.
Bannakin Skywalker
I wonder who Badger's favorite star wars character is?
I love how many sounds are ripped straight from half life 1 and 2 that was like 80% of my life from 2002 on
When you're a Death Trooper in Battlefront 2 and they tell you to hold the line. Motherfuckers, I AM the line!
7:59  I don't know if they're playing on PC or console all the honestly I'm pretty sure it's PC but either way I've played battlefront 2 on PC and console and I've never encountered any sort of invincibility thing am I lucky probably
The "prank em Alec" bit has to be one of the funniest things I've heard in a while
bro HE'S TURNING THIRT-
I need to know what stormtrooper mod that is in 5:02 fr im begging
Lol now I'm wondering if skulker watches GMR
“I haven’t even touched the rum yet”
My pc click clacked itself fuck
FUCK YOUTUBE IS DOING 3 ADDS A VIDEO SHIT SHIT SHIT
I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this is some of the funniest shite I've seen XD
Review vid Cold War
wait you have a wife ?
I didn’t know Rey was a Jew🤔
7:00 All except the mortality rate.
EY YO OUR BOY IS MARRRIED!?!? FUCK YEAH!!!
the first order is hosted
is that tucker?
2:07 This is funny as hell
Badger did the best go off?
Everything current does. I've been able to do since 2016 with a bank called starling
Wait, badger married????
Did... he literally say he doesn't give a damn about any of the horrible shit EA and Dice does or any of the criticism because he has fun with his friends? ...go off I guess.
It’s not getting fixed dude
Badger saying he can say anything me wondering when he gonna say the n word
BADGER'S MARRIED?????
I remember when this channel wasn't a passionless meme
"Why is Anakin a banana?"  Because Bananakin Groundsitter has to exist within our dimension or else he will rip it apart from jealousy.
the republic commando looks like it could literally just be a halo spartan
Badger meet me at the courthouse tomorrow
Badger if I sing huge Target one more B1 battle droid I will delete your YouTube channel myself I told this the other YouTubers but I am serious about this one
It's DA MASHER SHEAF OHN DA SOTA
I wanna see badger as deadpool
10:31 What da Jorge doing?
Spider Man ain't so friendly now is he
YOU'RE TOO LATE SPIDER-MAN WEED HAS BEEN LEGALIZED
this man looks like his favorite star wars character is salacious b crumb
Meanwhile in a board meeting on the death star: We should just glass Yavin 4. The problem would solve more problems.
Thx sponsor. Fxck the community for complaining.
You have an unhealthy relationship with schalasish crumb
Bro, u r so damn funny, u turned my boredom and depression into excitement and happiness, keep on doing the best u can my guy
0:05 I don't know why that made me laugh
I love how in the "Signal calibration in progress", at the bottom, it's literally just gibberish in Mando'a writing
Bananakin, I don't have a planakin, start panickin'!
You should do a only droid fight
“Welcome back to me and my homies ruining the Star Wars franchise” don’t worry, Disney made sure to take care of that already.  Edit: besides The Mandalorian
This and the halo degenerate video keep linking each other lol
Get away today so I can violate you!
Is it bad that I love all of the guys in white in starwars movies
I love the sound effects from the 2005 Battlefront 2. I grew up on that game, so I recognized the sounds immediately.
Go ahead, call master chief,  no body out steals the Bloodravens.
“The dark side is a path way to many abilities some consider to be unnatural Gregory”
Just earing free tayk and then the scorch quote made me laughing for 30 minutes
Dude is playing against ai
4:59 All imma say is the deep lore fans might disagree lately lol
Badger play the Burger King games I promise you that you won’t be disappointed
Everytime this dude does a sponser I'm like: wait this aint the vid?
2:10 Bananakin
"Meticulously protected". Citation please
Has anybody translated the text that appears at the bottom of the "Technical Difficulty" screens, or is that just gibberish?
I think George Lucas would look at this video and just be like. "Serves Disney right"
bussian radger
You look like my friends dads friends boss named Steve
TYEH PTU DA MAMSTR CHFIE IN DA STR WRS
Salacious Crumb could 100% deviously lick the Death Star
you should do more halo
Will he play extraction?
Every badger video is a wonderful gift
Do an Apex legends part 2 please
I dread the day he sees S.Crumb as playable in lego SW-TSS (the Skywalker saga) (for clarity he shows up in the overview trailer behind Jabba).
Is there more channels like this I need the funnys
How are you guys getting matches and I can’t even connect to Supremacy😂
never did i think clifford the stormtroopers rick click would hit harder than an alcoholic disgruntled step-dad yet here we are.
I just found your videos this week and I’m hooked. You’re a funny fuckin guy and your content is fresh and super neato man.
Hey badger can you maybe play apex again everything has changed
Just wanted to say thank you badger for Makeing the content that you do. I recently have been having a really hard time in life and your videos give me that tiny bit of joy I need to get through the day also I bought your gamer supps and it is amazing I even used your discount code.
Bf2 is just tf2 with the starwars mod
bro im going to snort some gg
If due current events you'd want to rebrand first half of your name I'd understand, but I think we all know it's just a name and it really doesn't matter. But you always could become TheBadge
4:54 your first job and you think it’s cool
1:40 revenge bitch
1:02 that’s the weed kicking in 😂
This is the second instance of Kirby havin a light saber
Does anyone know why Badger stopped making siege videos?
Packing heat like Alec Baldwin!
I think I'd sign up for current if you'd shown me the other side of the card too
Seeing master chief in battlefront 2 is one of the most cursed things I have ever seen
Hehehe bananakin
I can confirm kentucky is indeed  farming, coal, fried chicken, and horses
Badger, if you ever decide to try and tackle Titanfall 2, i just want to let you know that you're gonna want to get it on PC so you can use Northstar Client  Multiplayer is unusable otherwise due to a hacker bricking the servers as well as the fact that the devs don't care
do a gmod vid
I would love to see Badger and crew on aliens fireteam!
Bro why is the fallout 3 video age restrictied, it’s literally the best video ever. Why YouTube?😭😭😭
Honestly, I can see Badger and his friends as a bunch of clone troopers form the prequel era or stormtroopers from the originals or sequels fucking around in battle simulations. Their names can be seen as clone nicknames (Eekaj, Bing, and Skullker especially)!
Deathtrooper more like cloaktrooper
"about the star wars universe being so meticulously maintained, from the lore-..." Disney: *wheezing* HAHAHAHAHA... You serious?
....YOUR NAME DIDN'T AGE WELL.....         just saying!
Awesome Video :)
I like your thinking all we need to do is........Glass a Fucking Rebel Alliance planet and their unemployment rate is 0 Course on the downside employment is also at......well you guessed it zero to negative results but they were slacking and busy shooting stormtroopers so it evens out
Does Badger have Twitter?
Badger, im a really fan of you, I meet you whit the payday vidios XD u can do a video of Tf2?
599 videos
The rare Russian badger comes out of its year long hibernation to post a YouTube video then returns to hibernation
I'm not even going to ask who Tay K is. All I know is Eminem and the Beastie Boys are Gods.
The russianbager has been real quiet since russia is invading ukrain

Fun Fact: Bananakin Skywalker canonically has enough potassium to kill you with radiation.
Wonder if he'll play extraction
"They employ salacious crumb and I like it when he laughs"
Badger, have you ever thought of trying the also semi-dead game known as Planetside 2?
petetion for RussianBadger to temporarily rename his channel to UkranianBadger
Badger I started painting with your videos in the background because your shit posting resonates with my art style of chaos
Jet trooper = super soldier in Wolfenstein new colossus
you say its supported by ay current
You might wanna change your name bro...
You must rename yourself TheUkrainianBadger
Mijn vriend  told me star wars is dum ten i beat him
I wanna see badger and his friends use turrets to beat the department of justice for a video
After certain recent events involving two European countries going at each other, I wonder if TheRussianBadger is going to change his name
whats is jellos soundboard
dude I watched survivor man by Les Stroud (fucking watch it by the way incredible shit) survive in norway and he siphoned GAS into a FUCKING PEANUT BUTTER JAR and I swear to god if it's just a "coincidence" TheRussianBadger said peanut butter and gas shouldn't be combined
I Just Realized Today How Many Frames And How Good The Resolution Was On His Mo-Cap It Looked So Good From FPP
day 6 of asking badger to play more enlisted
More 2042!!!!!!!!
With all that’s happening in the world he might have to change his name to American Racoon.

Badgerfront II
If you ever see this trust me play Star Wars battlefront 1(2015)

Tabg and tabs
I was on the live I feel asleep but woke up when someone said revive me I have the ray gun
Wait Badger, why aren't you verified???
"So meticulously maintained, from the lore..." Imma stop you there Badger, Disney removing Legends from canon the moment they bought Lucasfilm to the 5 movies released under their supervision invalidates that statement. (See episode 8 for a few reasons why.)
I’m unsubscribing you and your people are just bad.   You’re just bad people.
Video skit idea: Me and my disabled guy, bouta go 70 mph in a school zone...
Hey Badger, i bet ya won't see this, but in case you do, you should check out Pavlov Vr or Echo Arena. Both are VR games and i have a blast playing them
RUSSIANBADGER WE DARE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS TO PLAY DEEP ROCK GALACTIC OR FACE THE DWARVEN WRATH!!! not me the dwarves say this.
I kinda wonder if with all this stuff goin on, is he gonna change his name to TheUkrainianBadger

This guy is the definition of insanity
Can’t wait to here about your new channel, the UkrainianBadger
What is with badger shooting a clone of himself in the intro.
This humorous videos have the chaos of a black hole
I am scared about what would happen to my brain if I slept while Badger, Grouse, Heavenly and the rest try to cause brain dents to everyone in different streams
Are you going to change your Name from „russian badger” to „ukrainian badger”?
Average tf2 enjoyer 3:28
Fam change ur name until the war is over
Day 4 of asking badger to play more enlisted
Every video it gets better
Funny how angrycops got a meme about you sent to him.
Make pay-day with mod’s
Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing on Tatooine?  Sir, picking up some power converters.
I love when badger and his friends just get together and turn any game into a gaggle of memes and jokes
day 3 of asking badger to play more enlisted

15:52

Bananakin I don’t have a plan a kin
14:01 Maul: *Flies into another room* Kirby: *following maul* FIGHT BACK N*GGA FIGHT BACK
The animation tho! Wonderful!
guacamole gamer swaws
Does anyone know if they have made a video on Rust? Low key interested in seeing how they do in that game given its "natural operations".
Hey, badger? Will you do a video on infinite next? Might be fun.
play Holdfast Nations at War
I remember once getting like a 20 kill streak with the first order jettrooper. That was fun for me. The other players? Not so much

Hey badger you should play hell let loose. Great ww2 game with realism in it. I’m talking about bullets flying over your head and tunnel vision type realism
More of this
More bagger
Could you go back to dauntless? There has been lots of changes and plus I think it would be funny to see you stick it to godzilla.
If anyone sees this press the link https://youtu.be/HAtkMuyVPS0  Shoot all your problems away
Getting Current thanks to Badger using the Opera GX I got thanks to Badger

This game dead as AF and got no damn support but god forbid you mod in the wrong thing
Imagine a emo kid in a wheelchair on a bridge what they gonna do jump off
Badger I am bored with tabg should I buy left 4 dead 2
5:28  Now I want Lucasfilms and Disney to actually approve of a Star Wars movie about a bunch of non-clone Stormtroopers who are exactly this, and they're indirectly responsible for 90% of the shit that goes down in the original Star Wars trilogy through sheer coincidence of events playing out. It would be perfection incarnate and make a bunch of die hard Star Wars fans scream.  The cherry on top is Badger and his friends playing the Stormtroopers.
OMFG I AM SUCH A SALACIOUS CRUMB FAN I HAVE A LIMITED EDITION FUCKING FULL ASS PUPPET VERSION OF HIM REPRESENT!
In battlefront two, you should only be playing a faction if they wear a white face covering helmet on the Default assault class skin.
When FNV 3 other DLCs?
you got covid you good
napalm is just spicy putty change my mind
My mom: they do you like Spider-Man? Me: 0:06

The League of Legends ad guy was arrested due to Child Abuse and Assault, I just wanted to point that out.
What do you stream on?
hey badger, theres this amazing mobile game called call of duty mobile, i will happily show you the ropes.
Is it just me or should badger make another apex video now that it's updated to hell and back and the spitfire is in the care package
He even makes a ad read funny/entertaining
Imagine if you hear I’m bout a turn into hot pocket in star wars
5:25 it'd be the sith version of bad batch
Still waiting for the next  seige video

Generation zero I want to see this torn apart
Bananakin

Ayo badge did you know that your next video will be your 600th video?
I have to be somewhere between boomer and zoomer because fortnite is stupid to me and I'd rather talk to people in person, even if it's just about memes.
Thank you for curing my depression.
❤❤❤
Wait if regular spiderman is anakin, then symbiote spiderman should be Vader
I found a solution for that hack problem if you get a Walker (the two Legged that Chewbacca steals on endor)  Then you can walk over people and it will kill them
Can You make more videos then just one a month! YouTube need to pay you more 😂
I want to see the chaos you could do in risk of rain 2, PLEASEEEE
try splitgate
Yo Badger, would you ever consider doing a Team Fortress 2 vid?
I can only imagine how these guys would break "Angels Fall First". Will all the toys they have.
Dude there's a new operator who can patch up defense holes in siege. Her name is azami and she has these kunai things that put flex seal over holes made by sledge and the like.
Where siege videos
"Ayou keek hies ayeis!"

Hey Badger, have you ever considered trying out Rocket League? It's free to play and can be a  ton of fun with friends. And hey, if yall need a guide, I've been playing for like 6 years.

Play gang beasts
Swas
Yo ride that Tauntaun like a Bantha
“If it isn’t Master Chief, stealing my intellectual property.”   This becomes subjectively more funny in light of EA blaming Halo Infinite for the botched launches of Battlefield 2044.
I feel like he would love deep rock plz see this at lest
1:08 oh don’t worry Disney already did that lmao
Shit, this doin numbrs
Treee
"These things were never meant to be combined" *looks at gamer supps and alcohol. Only one way to find out...

13:10
Hey badger there is a game called generation zero and I think you might enjoy it.
I'm literally brand new to the channel, but this is hilarious I love it I will be a regular viewer
You should play some more Dauntless, and if you don't.. then that's fine  - Heretical Khorne Worshipper

1 video needed for 600 vids
Imperial Scout violates Tauntaun, colorjzed.
The goat
Badger their is a new operator coming out in 2 or so days on rainbow six I think you should do a video on them
Wow wouldn’t it be cool if you like did another *rainbow six siege* video ?
POV: You're opening the door for the ATF
I'm 99% sure the invincibility thing is actually a bug, first time i encountered it was in a 4 player game of survival or whatever that "defend the bases" game mode is and i was playing with people i knew and everyone including NPCs could only go down to 1 health. So if it was a hacker they must have done it previously on that server and the effect was still there when we started a game? Notice the invincibility never accompanies other cheats, how often do you actually see people hacking like aimbot, one shot, shooting through walls ect, its actually surprisingly rare in BFII, far more rare than this bug has become.
What the fuck is the music playing during the signal calibration screen? lmao
Yo I just thought about this, why don't we have something like this for warhmmer like mods or whatnot, lasguns, the guard it would be awesome
10:29 XD
This guy ready to break the forth wall, his amount of cameras is as many as the set of deadpool
9:00 Well the Crow can out and the main character was the one who died. Other than respect for the dead I see no reason for that film not to come out.
Badger you NEED to play red dead redemption 2 with da boys right now you fucking ass crack
If you ever make a third episode you have to call it Return of the Kek

Yo badger There is a funny game called Deep Rock Galactic
Have you thought about playing Warhammer Vermintide 2

It just hit me but if these mad lads play Team fortress two the chaos would be beautiful
Downside to playing on ps4 no mods upsides no infinite health

Unpopular opinion: Sith are the good guys, and Jedi are the bad guys

Fun fact: Alex Baldwin was the producer... So he would have capped himself if he didn't want to do more scenes. X)
IS BADGER FUCKING MARIED  cringe
Long Live the Empire
Why do you like that alien monkey
I hope you and The Boys play Ready or Not
599th video
Seeing Heavenly as Freddy D. Fazballs and say just “Cringe” for half a second is probably the most I’ve laughed in a millennia.
you should play ready or not again its way different from what it used to be
Play dying light 2 please
RIP brave soul who got burnt to a crispy pile of soot for opening a door
Heavenly just kicked my ass outta your discord XD  I didn’t do nothing lemme back in PLEASE?    Heavenly has lost my respect though :(   Please???
Badger really just said, “you got me at salacious crumb.”
Salacious Crumb is dope. Good to see him finally get some respect.
juicer
You need to play some of that Aliens: Fireteam Elite my guy
The game is finally fixed again, again
Quick someone make a crumb nft
Bananakin strikes again
Just found your channel because of your Fallout video, this video was uploaded on my birthday.

When i try to type Nicks(your nickname i have forcefullly givne you and i dont care for your real name nicks funny) utube channel and as soon as i put the letter R UKRAINE, WW3 IN UKRAINE, UKRAIN'T TAKE MY OIL RUSSIA: *LAUGHS IN RUSSIAN*.I am done anyways Nick you are part of ww3 whether you like it or not
If stupid shit in games makes you happy,  try Holdfast with your friends,  it is unbalanced and goofy as fuck
his vids are so funny i can watch them 20 fuckin times (minimum) before it gets boring. subscribe to this dude NOW
yo badger. play bioshock
I’m sad I went back to watch your new Vegas video and it’s age restricted probably for no fucking reason
The quality only gets better
tbh i watch anything you put out cause it’ll always have me in stitches but is there any chance of more R6 operator videos now that there are more?
you know you should try Team fortress 2  for the next video.
Bruh Irish and Hannah be chillin tho
Badger uploads more than most of my fav youtubers and he had to edit and use the mocap suit like bro how
when u doing rainbow 6 again🥺
I thought EA hasn't fixed the problem where you can't kill each other
Hmm. do TF2 please. And remember gimmicks
badger you are quality content.
You should try Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Hey can we get a wartunder one
Mr. Badger please make a video on Mordhau, it seems right up your alley. Thank you for your time.
4:50
Jet Trooper got some Terrible Terry Tate vibes, my guy. Hot damn.
deez NUTS
Yeah, Badger I am playing it ight now, and you weren't kidding people like to hog the heoes/villains
ur discord mods are cringe i just troll furries on it
The McDonald’s hairline grows stronger every upload.
I usually skip sponsor reads... BUT NOT FUCKING HERE... I love the funny moments in there
Literally whenever I have a bad day... I just watch one of these videos and I am in a good mood
Badger I think you'd love WarFrame. It's a coop shooter which makes you feel like Goku with hella guns, hella speed, hella practical customization and hella cosmetic customization even down to your arrows.
Badgers wife when all the crumbs show up :|
Video about current does not do it at the current time…
For some reason the playback alway replay the Fortnite part
New R6 video when? 😔
PoV: You do all the SFM animations with a PoV camera
i heard of this game called clownfield 2042 which is basically a parody of battlefield 2042, its fun.
Mate needs to cool it with the animation. It’s cool but it gets old when it’s all the time
MOAR Payday 2
MOAR BAGER
What kind of double a batterys do you buy

2:49 Boba Fett on the hutt cartel 15ACW(After clone wars) colourized
Badger is slowly turning into a vtuber and im not complaining
6:38 is your unemployment rate clip
fortnite has gone to far
You should play rainbow 6 extraction
Dude did you play far cry 6?
This video convinced me to get EA Play to get BF2 on steam. You should be paid for it.
I would totally read a comic about stormtrooper captain B4-DG3R. He's onto something with the idea of an Imperial squadron with the dynamic of his friend group.
Yo, ever thought of playing Project Zomboid with the bois? I think you guys would have a fair bit of fun there.  Love all your videos man, keep it up! And thanks for the discounts on GamerSupps ;)
Do dying light since its out
I appreciate the 04' battlefront sound effect when you swap cameras in the intro
10:30 hello Mario BANG
6:40 THEY WORK IN HELL NOW or heaven
Bro you all are next gen LIBERALS like no cap 🧢 my guy. Also I bought some of that water you been having but I still prefer the Guacamole gamer Farts. I think am addicted 🥸👍
Lol, badger need to see TF2 then

badger seems like the person to out homless a homeless man
Okay yeah this one felt like kind of a flop, well at the time of writing this 2.4 million is a really fucking big number, but not really for badger. Meh vid
Selacious Crumb and Freddy Freaker are brothers
Spencer please play plastic man
תודה על התוכן הטוב

Have you considered playing dying light 2?
All YouTube has left is Badger or the sweats dying to defend EA and their busted catalog. I choose Badger.
Where do I get mods for this game
badger when you play bayday 2 as thanos and cops become spiderman with payday 2 mods.
1hp glitch reportedly fixed
y'all should play Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Video number 600 soon
The call out on YouTube. That's based!

1:02 lmao mans can’t hold his boof
6:18 I don't think I've ever laughed harder at economics
Can you do a Payday 2 video please
This man makes me want to not skip the sponsorship bit
TF2 being 14 years old: am I a joke to you?
11:14 If you look closely, he gets by a rocket and dies for .25 seconds before it cuts to the next scene.
gammer supps slogan, What do you mean we cant use chemical weapons :(
"Protected franchise." as thought Disney didn't completely nuke it.
This man is my literal meaning of Jesus.  He saves my soul everytime I watch his blessings of videos.
5:40 the roles are reversed
Badger...the heavy...it has started to die...please...you must stop its death, but you mustn't forget to stop the dying light 2......
This is the most random video I ever watched.
Do star citizen
2:13 bananakin Skywalker
Hey badger, would you ever play Hunt: Showdown?
When I was younger I thought that master chief was from star wars
Love your content badger. You and the homies remind me of my gang of bois and myself. Keep up the laughs and fun!
The fucking cloaker sound scared the shit outta me 🤣
you should play tabg again
This is the Way.
There’s kyber private servers that give you more heroes and villains. It’s pretty based ngl
I might get aids so i can do a make a wish to play with these guys
Always the best
More Star Wars videos from my favorite content creator 😂
Whenever I play with my grandfather o have to literally play a trooper or a rocket jumper just so he has a chance and i still win
What do you make the animations in? They look really good 👍
do a Video on TF2
So just got done with forest Gump and I swear to fucking God badger and Tom hanks are the same human them mfs look like Mr fantastics offspring 🤣
“Packing heat like Alec Baldwin” just my humor 😭😭😭
Wait he's married?
Yeah I forget about him having a wife
The true pinnacle of comedy
Robo Recall
Play apex again
10:30
I have to ask what kind of troopers do you use for the CGI I know what the old empire storm troopers but where are those new ones I need to know what the names are
Yo badger, you should check out republic commando. You dont have to make a video on it but definitely try it
You should make another ghost recon breakpoint video
You should try playing anicrusis. It’s dumb but fun and would be hilarious.
5:54 i wouldn't   complain
I almost choked on my dinner at those Alec jokes. Those were cold-blooded and *hysterical!* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😐 my face at the animations
Bananakin splitwalker
MORE, MORE , MORE!!
why do all the golden videos get agecrestricted. im waiting for goobitube to restrict this
Badger: *talks about how EA abandoned the game*  Me:”so tf2, but worse.”
His hand movements are immaculate
Can anyone decode the orabesh in the cuts?
Bro, now that you mentioned TF2, I wanna see you and your friends cause chaos there too, cuz even tho TF2 is old as shit, it's still hilarious.
Play the game sharks vs divers depth
How many Team fortress 2 references god damn. Just play TF2 already :troll:
the oof sound got me lmao
Earn it act beware and stop it, unless you enjoy people taking your internet freedom under the guise of “do it for the children”.
When the ATF agent at you door hears you say "Alexa turn on the claymore Roombas"
Everyone is laughing but none of it is funny
I wanna see the gang play fome team fortress 2
You need to bring back clarence
There's no ruining the franchise. Disney already did that XD
The editing is so good that i even watched the sponsor
has russian badger ever done a tf2 video?
watched while dying light 2 was installing
You should have added green goblin to the jetpack and say "your boring me spiderman!
when the next rainbow 6 video?
this man has only his channel as the featured channels
5:33 to be fair, the Ashen One would totally win that fight
I'm really disappointed I can't play any EA games cause my account email had a typo and they won't fucking change it cause I haven't been able to check my account info in literal years. Dumb as shit
YouTube.com @Mechanical Axe
YouTube.com @Mechanical Axe
YouTube.com @Mechanical Axe
Just wait till he learns about kyber private matches
Can you please play R6V2 again? I want you to review again and server has been down for the past months
I love how you put the sound effects of the original battlefront 2 in the video
This man is fucking married? Not inly does he look 59 he aacts it too god daaayum.
Also tell heavenly to eat chunky peanut butter and milk to sustain
Bro badger lemme let you in on a rat tactic, a ratctic if you may. Use officer with bounty hunter inspiring presence and upgraded uhhh commanding presence and it get you points mad funky to roast peanuts
Eat you're friends
Badger… how many forms is Heavenly going to fucking get dude!?
bro, you cannot script this. I got an add that played for 2 seconds saying "people with ADHD" and then smash cut to a fucking current ad.
I am waiting for the "Unemployment" part to be clipped.
Hey badger in one of your world of tanks videos there was a mention of there being no rats in Alberta and that is actually true there was a whole war on rats like how Australia had a war on emus and there are task force of people to kill rats and there is also a hot line for reporting rat sightings so yeah
I'm a recent adopter of GamerSupps, but GGF9000 mixed with Like flavored seltzer is fucking delicious.
Bad News: his Fallout New Vegas video got age restricted
Personally I don’t have a problem using normal classes I mean I’m one of the best imperial snipers in the game
Debit cards are a waste of plastic, I prefer sexual favours for my transactions please
Petition to make Badger play Metal Gear Rising
Where is more rainbow six siege
"Can you imagine the first of the new series ending where Rey got flambe'd by a random trooper?"  Probably would have made the series better, tbh.
Anybody else recognize the similarities between battlefront and battlefield V (I guess maybe 2042)
Now property of Ernie Gang
Bananakin Skywalker
the sun never will set on the  'Schmeatwich deluxe empire' this post was made by #schmeatgang #schmeatergang #schmeater #schlagoon
I made an alt account to check if he really got age resrtricted on the first star wars battle front he got age resrticted
haha funny
Why haven't you replayed ready or not yet badgy wadgy
One more vid and hes at 600
The old Battlefront 2 sounds give me so much nostalgia
In an age where alot of gaming YouTubers are starting to say fuck it and turn into reaction channels it's fucking awesome badger is not only still doing gaming but making each new video better than the last
"Packin more heat than Alec Baldwin" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Thinking about if badger and his squad was in the star wars universe is the equivalent of the red vs blue series as a whole with them in it
God He is truly turning into fucking vegeta.
"abandoned by the developers" *devs ban u for modding*
Thinking about the "Imagine Badger's dumbass squad in Star Wars", that would probably make them pull a Jack Sparrow on Star Wars, like, you can't say it wouldn't be interesting to see four Stormtroopers that do land shots and have some braindead sense of humor destroying the whole inmersion with their stupid stuff.
Bananakin skywalker
Anybody else replay 5:32 a couple times too? If only fixing star wars cannon was so simple 😂
badger out here wit tha vegeta lineup
I love badger but man those baldwin jokes were a lot.
Anyone else think that the animations badger is putting in his vids is getting a bit annoying? Idk i think i personally would rather watch gameplay with commentary than watch the overdone animations. Old badger >>
youtube be stupid and dumb at ummm 24/6
Oh it's mods... i thought the devs literally just added random shit
Great stuff. Not gonna lie, I miss playing this, and it's a shame the developers ditched it just as people were enjoying it more 😞 no doubt Disney had something to do with it Disney: "Are you enjoying the game ^w^ well too bad, no more updates for you. We hate our fans after all!"
you know what, i would love to see you and the boys in some sort of Star wars side series as baground storm troopers, who all speaks and talks in the same goat level energy as this.  "you know what the death star took that unemployment rate down to 0%"
Wait badgers married? I’ve been watchin his Youtube for 1+ year and i’m just now hearing this?
I wish I can animate like that, respect.
WAIT, BADGER HAS A WIFE?
This shit is S tier my guy
hey badger they fixed the servers recently:)

Wait, Badger is married?
9:45 BOOMER. 13:42 FUCK YOU, SPIDERMAN!
Wait bager has a wife? damn he made it bois
I mean. Inflation is now at zero.
Dude this made my day ya damn legends. Have you tried rainbow six extraction. It's as rewarding and infuriating as siege but totes pve....ish
Hi Spencer......
Man i am sad that this game is 6  years old
And 6 mins of dialogue
This episode is basically Badge giving his friends a public blowie and posting it on his channel for everyone to watch. What a bro, talkin' about how great his other bros are
its funny how the players in battlefront have better aim than the stormtroopers in the original trilogy
Also try playing on some Kyber servers with custom heroes and more mod support!
A video filled with endless ridiculousness and loads of fails. Still better than the sequel trilogy
I was just playing this last night lol
*ahem* leech payday 2 Would be cool next time
15:54 badgr waife
I love the fact that he used republic commando ps2 voice lines when talking about them
Badger for president 2024
can we have minecraft mods soon? just for the hell of it XD
Day 7 of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
Day 6  of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
Day 5 of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
Day 5 of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
I gotta say, once you put enough hours into this game the classes feel perfectly balanced.
Is he still with that chick that looks like a Pikachu?
Y is the last bf2 vid gone
9:22 TF2 video When? cause I'm pretty sure my guy just teased with the fact that we may get a TF2 video with him using the domination sound effect. (also, Another banger of a video badger. keep up the good work!)
If badger really like salacious crumb why didn't he put a clip of him playing as salacious crumb?
More of Star Wars please
I think my favorite moment from this was either "My dipshit monkey friends" or "How can you hate outside the club? "YOU CAN'T EVEN GET HIM" LMFAO
Ready or not vids with the boys 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏 beanbags 😎
Even homelessness dropped to 0📉📉😎
so edgy, bro
Wouldn't be a Badger vid if someone wasn't gunned down in the intro
Well technically anikin got cooked lmao
Tbh, I wanna see badger and themeatymarley playing some siege together
Anyone else just start skipping five min in because the first 5 are filler
When you stop the crime on alderan by blowing it up
When you watch Rey skywalker detonate you into a potato while saying PARRY THIS ONE

I died when i saw kirby chase after someone with a lightsaber at 14:00
I 100% wanna see a Star Wars series about Badger and the boys as an extremely chaotic stormtrooper squad who survived the fall of the Empire and now work as the galaxy's least organized group of mercenaries
9:28 JFK be like
Salacious B. Crumb The Video.
I got banned for making an Alex Baldwin meme about his stupidity. I'm glad you didn't 🤣
Right click with flametrooper and he'll shoot a fireball... In case you didn't knew XD It's the same as the sith-trooper...
I had no idea what you looked like until 4:00 minutes in during the ad. And you actually look very normal for being very monkey-man not normal.
Man loves this vid even though it’s just one giant shit post but at this point it’s becoming a diarrhea post and it’s amazing. Keep up the work badger and also congrats on the marriage  that’s a Pog right there.  (Yes this is cringe but hey we all been like that before)
From what I've learned, if you're good at a game, you will be called sweaty no matter how casually you play.
How do you download these mods tho
This is fantastic.   Now give me more.
The best video.
Best way to test out skins, coop
Wait... Badger is married?
Bro I wish the developers didn’t leave the game the was so much more they could do
80% of the kills in this video were bots
Remember the nobody wants a pink Darth vader bs some cunt at EA spewed ? LETS GO PIIIICKLE RIIIICK
i love the long poly green goblin
this video is sponsered by *SPIDERMAN*
y'all think badgers ganna make a video on Ark: Survival Evolved?

Badger u should totally play 2k u always talkin bout ball 🤣
Thank you for existing.
Now I’m all for the Sith Trooper’s under-barrel grenade launcher/sniper but the man has a literal oppression grenade that is fantastic in every way and cannot be overlooked
11:00
5:03 I did not expect to see Imperial Marines from The Force Unleashed in a RussianBadger video of all things. That's a damn throwback xD  Edit: Imperial Navy Commandos. Been so long I'm even mixing up names lol
Hey badger, you know you can mod payday2 right? Its stupidly funny
I feel like badger is like bungie, their content takes fucking forever to comeout, but its unbelievable amounts of fun when it does, its like playing the taken king when in first launched every time he uploads
is this an animation? if yes, give this man all the power he needs to make a good game.
I stopped playing this game for the reason that you encounter lvl 800 pro players everytime and it gets annoying XE
What if i got a gun license for a knife    I had to retype the word knife 5 times just trying to spell it after the a
still better than the last 3 starwars movies
0:15 like bobafet from fortnite, like mandolin from fortnite , like the storm trioper from fortnite , like the female character from Fortnite,  like the female chebaka from Fortnite
My man,your have to go back to r6 siege,there are so many new operators-
bro where the play of the game from the rust movie, i wanna see that shit

Dopamine levels going insanely up rn
9:35 does anyone know where this sound effects t comes from?

Excuse me? Why am I unsubscribed from Russian Badger? YouTube? You have an answer?
Russian Badger can make chess look like a Michael Bay movie XD
Wanna See Muh freebrams
Hey I don’t know if you are aware of this, but people have been stealing audio from your vids and putting it on YouTube shorts over some gta car footage
YESSSSS
Referring to Space Nazis as based 🤣 King 🤣
I really wish they would make a battlefront 3 with out trying to shove all the microtransaction garbage that they did with 2.
Does anyone know why he hasn't reviewed any of the new characters and updates on seidge?
It'd be really fun to see y'all do some Read Dead Online stuff
Do bane in Injustice 2
Russianbadger better play Atomic heart when it comes out cause it really seems his style
master chief is modded into this star wars game         _please insert drunk sounding version_
10% starwars battlefront 2 90% editing and motion capture suit 100% ballin
9:17 i Love the "Heavenly are you okay?" in the Background
I realize I'm just a drop in this bucket but the Alec Baldwin bit was pretty disappointing
Love the vid but could I get unbanned on your server. Name's CRUSADER#4855 I promise not to make trouble.
Heavenly, the amazing microwave
“Your behavior frightens and confuses me sir
Badger you truly helped me with the hardest stuff in my life your vids gave me a reason to laugh genuinely
weird coincidence. I just recently started playing Battlefront 2 again after not playing it for like, a year. Then I watched all of the star wars movies (Disney Trilogy isn't canon, so fuck them.) And I kept seeing this video. Just thought it was weird.
What a masterpeice!
Yo Badger you should play Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
You should play polygon
The hero classes are unbalanced on purpose so that you feel the same way a rebel would when facing Vader
8:10 you can run people over or crash or crash into other people during invincibility
By the by badger there's an article talking about fixing the 1hp hack so the game will be back whenever the hell they decide to do it.
Bananakin has arrived.
I think Badger likes salacious crumb a tad bit
Love the jokes, but too much animation, I miss the old videos like Spider-Man PS4 😢
Can  you make crossout vids
That Spider-Man PS1 Health Regen sound effect tho
Jorge
Russian badger was trying to get some extra time in the video so he started counting cameras
Bananakin Skywalker
*perfectly maintained until disney
Ah yes bananakin Skywalker Jedi of the banana republic
my computer just refused to play the video at the 7 min mark. it just wont let me, and I HAVE BELL FIBER INTERNET.
Oh my god this is literally my favorite video on YouTube now.
Almost 4 mill and your 500th video Gotta post a bomber next video
7000;[
Funny
BRO PLEASE DO SPACE MARINE MO-CAP PLEEEEEEEEASE
Is there actually any footage of the mods in the game or all just this mind numbing animation and commentary
"Eventually the survival rate of everything drops to 0." -Fight Club
sith trooper right click and m107 in phantom phorces is the same thing
Imagine if each games picked a damn game and kept at it
Bananakin Skywalker. 😂
RussianBadger is just american SovietWomble with a, somehow, more regular upload schedule.
You should do like ads'n shit on fiver/equivalent or even tv, if i saw this kind of stuff on tv, i'd buy it.
Try playing Titanfall 2 I think you will enjoy it
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORGE!
Seeing YouTubers do sponsorships for credit card companies kinda makes me sad since they’re selling out
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo the video's overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
R6 video?
I had to watch this video more than two times because the spagetti sauce from the reach video still pours out of my ears.
ray gets flambéd by random trooper, this was a hilarious video
SpIdErMaN
Badger Will you ever upload another Apex viď ?
I was today years old when I learned jaba’s monkey lizard had a name and I’ll be today years old when I forget
8:31 you can see that delicius source engine in the dumpster, not the engine, but what godly entitys does it summon
I love the animation quality
Badger PLEASE play dying light 2 that would be AMAZING
I would love to see you play the dark souls games. Especially with all your friends ganging up on a boss.
Another Russian Banger🔥🔥
Where can I download some of these mods?
Badger do destiny 2 next
Based First Order solving child unemployment throughout the galaxy.
"That doesn't make him wrong."  No, he's wrong. He's just not incorrect.

a good non hero class is heavy
oi mate, thank you for playin my favorout game again
We all know the real reason they fixed the glitch is because Badger called them out!
Bananakin Skywalker! Need I say more?
What’s the percentage of people in this video that were actively high.
Badger dance!! Outro dance!! LETS GO !!!!!
... wait so one of the reason they demonitized the last SW's vid over joking about Jabba owning slaves... Bro WTF
9:04
9:25 best thing ever LOL
Yall should try the Kyber servers they allow any type of mod including gameplay changes
Does Badger not share any of the sub / donation money with the squad?
The hell to youtube censorship.
Darth Kirby
badger play garden warfare
Current looks like an RGB Visa card. I'd get one but I'm not in the States
I know this is old news at this point but I really love that you give all of your friends a character for each episode. It makes following the madness so much easier and that much funnier.
You need to play farcry 6
I wonder how they found people to play with everytime i download it, the servers are dead
The Deathtrooper is just a Combine Soldier from half life
i appreciate the amount of salacious crumb in this episode, thank you
God I love this man....
never have i ever screamed selcacious crumb's name so loud before
Is it the region I'm playing with or does the game not have many players, it take like 20 minutes to find a match and in some matches no one can die
POV: Rare footage of the Biden admin solving the unemployment crisis.
i think he likes the monkey
Ur fuckings videos are 1% gameplay 99% u talking with fucked animation what happened?
Hey badger a friend told me they had a dream about me. I asked and they said my fit went hard.
You guys have to do Left 4 Dead 2 Versus mode
God I remember when I grinded this game for months to get the old master darth maul skin and having a fucking blast with my friends after seeing this I’m gonna play it again
bananakin skywalker did nothing wrong
but mom said its my turn on the tauntaun
PASTA: “Head empty, only bullet.” TF2 Heavy: “I’ve yet to meet one that can outsmart bullet.”
AY MA BADGER POSTED
when tf2 vid
Badgur's hairline is like a glacier. You can't really see it move, but if you compare the statistics, it definitely be movin'.
Badger has a *wife*?!??!
CLOAKER!
How many of badgers friends do yall think are on government watchlists
May I suggest - ARMA3? It's been out for a while now, modded and moddable to hell. Also, custom mission editor. Pick a franchise, pick all the franchise and mix the gear from all of them to your liking in the arsenal. I would dare you, but temptation is better.
badger i wanna see u and the boys play halo infinite!
oh man this look awesome,I'm goignt o reinstall the game *keeps getting the 1hp bug in the game*
I guess it’s now cannon that skullker owns the fortnite bit
Master cheif, would you mind telling me what ur doing in star wars.   Killing kirby, Sir
Back again with a banger
Petition for a mod where the Death Troopers Gun gets replaced and it turns into a 44. Magnum.
I thought your first video about Battlefront II was epic all by itself.  Thanks for the sequel! :D  Really, seeing Master Chief kick unworthy Stormtrooper ass ranks up there with teddy bears in Vietnam.
When you find out a Demi god named Russian lives kinda 30 min away from you❤️🥵
Ultimate Try Not To Laugh
Bananakin Skywalker is my favourite Jedi
I'm not used to such interactive videos like this. But I do find them entertaining!
Crime level? Zero Poverty level? Gone Homelessness crisis? Gone. No planet no problems.
5:40 Super_EI_Tobio is asking if Russian is streaming, well, he'll be super happy if once he sees this video.
Banan-ikin is probably my favorite mod out of this entire video
15:50 who is that female character?
Now play titanfall 2. I can only imagine what mess you guys can get into in that game.
OG Battlefront sfx scratch the serotonin in my brain  edit: I recognized every other sound you used in this video and I can officially say my hyper fixated brain melted in happiness
That Alec Baldwin joke is CRAZY 💀
I just wish the render distance on the lego mods were better
why does the master chief mod look like the game is a Star Wars VS Halo  game we  will never get? i fucking want that now
Video 6 of recommending risk of rain 2  Also thank you for playing more bf2
Would love to see a behind the scenes of how these videos are made. Like how da hell do u record an intro in vr for the real
That’s what I like to call Bannanakin skywalker
Wait till he finds out about Kyber servers
Something tells me badge and his gang are about to single handedly revive this game
10:29 HELLO MARIO
This is Emma's son speaking, 13:47 YESSSSS! Bender's catchphrase from Futurama!
I use your videos to time how long my fried chicken is frying
10:25 tf2 in a nutshell, a game so broken yet so fun
Based content as always
Plz do tf2
When Russian Badger discovers mods…
Vladimir the impaler solved starvation in his territory by locking those who complained in a party hall and setting it on fire. Edit: wait, nah, i think it was poverty
He doesn't need ads because he advertises in the video
Who else is always high af at 2 am watching Badger? XD
seriously badger does look like vegeta. now i kinda want him to do a galick gun
I haven't watched one of your videos in a few years and I'm already impressed by how much you've stepped it up. Well done
wait, wait. is the jet trooper just a Star Wars Cloaker?
amazing vid, literally watched the whole thing even the sponsor....
Guys I think he like Solacious Crumb
I know you like putting in lots of time into your videos but I feel like they are loosing their touch and just becoming a jumbled mess…
I recommend you to play deep rock galactic
Could you do a video for pokemon legends arceus with your friends if you'd want to ofcourse
Good thing 'bout badger, he got good sponsors and better games
Lets be real. Glassing the planet dropps All the rates to 0% except for mortality rate.
I honestly wish Badger had a VODs channel, because I'd then have SO MUCH content of his to watch from the raws, even if he waited to post certain vods if he was using them to make videos or something afterwards, I'ds till love to watch the VoDs of his.
Glen gorblen be talking facts about Weed, also anyone wanna go to Alaska?
I like how heavenly new sfm character changes every video and this time he is freddy bruh XD
Yeah, Badger, the Star Wars franchise is so carefully maintained that Disney eliminated the expanded universe when they bought it
I had no idea Badger was married to Asuka from Tekken. Congrats man
Great Content Creator, Great Friend group, Great community, and apparently as a YouTube viewer mainly I find out that this man is married… I mean this guy literally got it all right now.
How did I miss this banger of a video? Bruh they doing mods now let’s goooo
Actually Spider-Man could totally use a lightsaber, his spidey sense would keep him from chopping his own arms off
This means we're getting a Republic Commando video next, right......
Your battlefront content is the best
Badger needs to do a video on dying light 2 👍
I just want an official star wars movie where the main characters are nobodies and spend a good 7th of the movie talking about the pros and cons of genocide!
Are you in a bit too hard with the salacious crumb
My fucking glutes hurt.
That was awesome Badger. Can’t wait for the next upload
this channel is the only one where i actually watch the sponsor parts
I don't know why YouTube kids exists when they still demonatize their users
Rare W for YouTube recommendations. This is amazing. I’ll be binging this channel.
Salacious Crumbs stock value has skyrocketed, also fuck auto correct, I can’t change it
This video got me thinking about, what is the real world how to kill feed?
I hope people who post cringe get Galaxy Brownies without the galaxies
Quality over quantity <3
Loved the video! I would like two see you and your friends play Team Fortress 2
im gonna lose braincells but this is where the fun begins 0:00
What's wrong badger? Show us those funny numbers on your card
Current deez nuts
8:29 they actually are gonna fix the imortality glitch soon in a server update
God his editing skills are so breath taking I haven't watched any of ur vids for a while but its good to come back and see a massive improvement, keep up the hard work
Clicking on this video, I got a star wars mobile game ad
Cring
I would love to see badger do a team fortress 2 video after all the references he does to it
How the hell do you get Master chief in Star Wars battlefront two?
Who else fell to the floor laughing from Badger saying “Fuck you Spiderman!”
Bananakin Skywalker.
5:30  Badger, you literally just described A Clone Apart
I heard news that they fixed the 1hp exploit, is this true?
are these game reviews or animated shorts
You’re my favorite creator. I loved the guacamole gamer fart. It’s like all baja no blast.
Well this is an insane video...I got nothing else to say. =)
The death trooper is op ngl
Yo if you need a ree kid in your group let me know. :)
The reason why I don't skip the sponsors
Badger pls do team fortress 2
Badger is single handedly bringing back based and cringe
can you make a video for star wars the fallen jedi order
Lol Bananakin Skywalker
The Alec Baldwin but is my favorite
Badger and Star Wars goes together like rum and Coke. Enjoyable but too much will give you a headache but in a fun way
thats cool Anyway Here’s the Recipe for brownies: 1/2cup butter 2eggs 1cup sugar 1/3cup cocoa powder 2teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2cup flour
Upload more pls
I love the fact that I know that in this video your going to shitpost battlefront 2 because of the sponsorship in the beginning if the video
Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing in Star Wars?  Sir, finishing this fight.
Fun Fact: There's no such place, as Wyoming, think about it, have you ever BEEN to Wyoming?
Cant wait for Badger to explore the SCP Foundation and making Cancer real.
it's been awhile since i've seen a badger video WHEN THE FUCK DID HIS PRODUCTION BUDGET GET SO GOOD
Base knight class curbs Vader while planting c4 on yavin 4
R6 Extraction video when?
I've watched this so many times and I forgot to comment because of it
7:27 Great. Now I want a jerrycan labeled as ‘Skippy’ peanut butter.
i fucking love this
Not age restricted yet
what model does he use for the very beginning of the video?
All these epic First Order classes show how the FO should have been. An elite core of super troopers that just annihilate republic forces with ease.
Love the videos you make  Thorn from siege is apparently cloaker from payday
If you listen closely at about 9:20 you can hear someone saying, "Heavenly are you ok?" and that's both wholesome yet hilarious to me.
idk man... i really dont like those animated puppets for some weird reason
You know what. Since we're on the topic of Spiderman, I wouldn't put it past Marvel if they find a way to intertwine the Star Wars and the Marvel Universes.
About 15 whole seconds of actual gameplay content here. You shouldn't narrate every sentence that's being said with those god-awful animations. Thank god you had a stormtrooper waving his hand around, taking up half the screen instead of showing funny content of the game in the title. Animation work is good, Gameplay content isn't even there to watch
No WAY you just said “Packin heat like Alec Baldwin” 😂
badger has a wife???
please tell me this revives the player base for a short amount of time
Get the flamer the heavy flamer
My man walks up and down in his mocap suit impersonating Master Chief with a fcking pokemon on his shoulder, WIFE comes in, awkward silence and then: "as long as you are staking paper to the ceiling...I dont care. Dinner is ready".
It sucks that EA has a reputation to abandon games.  Fuck ea but their games are fun.
i find it funny the game is abandoned by ea but you can still get perma banned for using to many mods
God Badger your videos were hilarious before but now there just insanely funny specially with the motion capture shit
Hey Badger I know this is a bit awkward but when you mention the TF2 sound effect do you think you'll ever do a video on TF2 like you mentioned it a lot throughout a lot of your videos and I was really hoping to see you break down each of the classes that I love so much Just to mention of it if this comment gets enough likes maybe we can get it and I don't know It probably won't do anything but maybe it will
Ayyeee!! This video was uploaded on my birthday! No wonder I keep seeing it in my recommended haha.
And here i thought TROOPERS HAD REALLY BAD  AIM
Fun fact: I have a natural and artificial strawberry allergy. Badgers GGF9000 is THE FIRST drink that doesn't make me feel like I'm dying. Much love to you man
Im a level 700 flametroop...
MARRIED?????
You guys have to try gorilla tag it’s a virtual reality game you guys would do amazing
I have the high ground bananakin
Brilliant to see battlefront 2 vids doing well, the game lives
Wait. Bafger is married?
now i really want a disney + spin off series with just russian badger and his friends just argueing about everything
I’d kill for that master chief mod lol 😂
That ending credits song? Fire!
I literally decided to download star wars after this
ballinbaldwin_420 is perfection
This guy literally plays around in VR for a living
Didn't they abandoned battlefront 2 and battlefield v to work on 2042?
Play my friend pedro on steam
How did Current stop your banning?
badger have you tried galactic assault yet? whenever a hacker sets the 1hp exploit I go to galactic assault or star fighter assault
ahaha shiiit that's never gets old!)
I love that I just hear in the background “heavenly are you okay?” From someone’s family during one of the intense bits.
Recommendation: Evolve, it’s a older game and the basics is to kill the monster as A hunter or you can play as the monster and kill the hunters or complete the object before you are killed.
Oh it’s beautiful
Is it just me or does anyone else what Badger and his buddies to plat Team Fortress 2?
Miss the old animation, it was scuffed but so fun to watch!
Imagine your just a squad of rebels And then some dip shit with a flame thrower just kills you closest Friend and the just go’s swaws
the moving letters at sec 35 and following are Mandalorian letters... don't worry its a keysmash and I wasted time of my life to try and decode it
I play this game all the time and I NEVER see badjur in a server 😞
The damn Alec Baldwin joke man. The guy is going through enough grief and guilt as it is. Not to mention the fact that most didn't bother to research who was shot. Also, for god's sake, directors, quit using Blanks. I thought after The Crow, people would learn that shit.
It played the Machina collateral sound effect 9:23
Not all that protected Disney has ruined it
me: getting urge to get back on battlefront 2 after all this time after this video also me: no friends to play with now that im at college and having no star cards to even come close to competing with other people
master chief in the soda during a war on a planet and we have these four just making chaos on the battle field like dang thats funny
- [x] Time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!
Badger you should go back and Play Fallout: New Vegas but modded like L4D2
Don't worry badger you can't ruin the star wars franchise when Kathleen Kennedy already did that.
btw, ea fixed the 1 hp exploit :)
I would play battle front but every lobby is hacked and It's just boring when you can't kill people or die
if badger was in a suit, you would think he was an actual businessman
The amount of original Battlefront 2 sound effects is great
8:35 , that joke, did he said „…..is packing heat like Alec Baldwin“
I swear whenever Badger finds a new game to play 5 mins after he starts he becomes literally *J E S U S*
Badger, just make a mocap movie already
"I don't see this changing anytime soon"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1o3koTLWM
Put the put the current in the ridge wollet big sponsor
Uranium go pop and atmosphere go yeet
Just waiting on this guy getting outed for beating his girl or some shit like that
Man the B**dwin jokes are BASED AF.
This is good content
Play tf2
Why did you bananakin the anakin 🤣
2:28 that callout to Master Chief is fucking golden
Hey can i have your imposter whopor
They finna turn Rey into a hot pocket
Got dayum that Alec Baldwin joke was so dark I'm 100% going to hell for laughing
EA also have been removed from making any future star wars games and also Battlefield 2042 has flop very badly to point they have given up on it
The Alec Baldwin memes made this video 10x greater
Ea will ban you for using mods but they won't fix the game breaking problem with the hackers. Great.
I dunno man, the alec callout is kinda overkill. the dead's families still grieving
not gonna lie, i can totally imagine you guys playing storm trooper squad who are meant to be the comedy characters. like something horrible happens and then it cuts to you and youre just like "hold shit...thats was cringe"
What program is used for animating the characters and scenes?
listen to me obi wan. Uncle ben
Idk ive played this game since release. Hackers are a problem. But I have no problem using base classes.
I don't even understand what the purpose of the video was but it doesn't matter because the editing quality and story telling were 10/10. I would watch any video at any length in this format. 10/10.
The decision to put 100% into every video you make was the best decision
this man actually bought a signed poster of Salacious B. Crumb
Badger really simping for salacious crumb man
i haven’t watched him since like the constant siege days, idk if he still posts r6 im too lazy to check but the lil animations have gotten so good i fucking love it
THIS IS MESSAGE ASAP WILL COME TO THE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE DEMONETIZED FOR JOKES Edit: Oh... well looks like we are save from demonetizing
Banankin Skywalker for the win
Badger i just want to say thank you, your videos are a reason for me to keep going, i'm at my lowest point and the comedy you and your friends bring me really helps a lot
Absolutely based no matter what you do
Fuck youtube and its censorship
I want r6 vids
Bananakin Skynanner needs to be added to the Star Wars extended universe.
You have to give appreciation to the 2.5 seconds of that POV cam at the start.
Why the fuck does he have so many glasses and hats
The next video he is going to post is the 600 video
Some how Battlefront 1 has lobbies
I like how this video is basically about the meaning of friendship
I love hoe much badger looks like a wall street scumbag
Can we all just appreciate bananakin skywalker for a minute though?
I wish that the kilo replaced with *CLOAKER*
bsquidge
Darth driper
*Un takes the tauntaun*
Always fun
This may be random but I know you liked tabg but they may stop update if tabg
damn baby yoda with the strap
Nooooooooooo new Vegas got age restricted
Can't wait for the respawn starwars FPS for the badger vid
But you're the one getting smoked gobby *fires 2 ak-47s*
I love the Star Wars dark souls reference if you haven’t seen that gif it’s awesome  Also Master Cheif would be a monster in the Star Wars Universe
Ayo is his hairline returning
These are some dark jokes...  AND I LOVE IT!!!
That fucking Alec Baldwin joke 💀💀
What chief mod is that?
Easily one of the most consistently funny channels I’ve ever watched.
im literally just listening to him talk about spiderman my favourite starwars character and i could you not, an ad for fortnite came up, wait for it. with spiderman on it.
You'll be pleased to know they just released a fix for a lot of the issues yyou mentioned.
Lets get another warzone video
This is aids, and I love it
10:45 Tf2 sitting there with these problems but times 3
I like the trend that happens when Badger kills himself in his skits randomly. It should happen every video.
Wait, Badger's married? That's lovely, good for him.
Hey I redownloded battle front two weeks ago crazy
Did I just get called Cringe by Rockstar Freddy?
bananakin skywalker
I would genuinly love to see a "bucket heads" type star wars show with these guys as just regular storm troopers dicking around the galaxy and doing dumb shit for the empire
5:43 u just burned Rey....Great work that's why ur the best.
EA's gonna get you 😢
Waiting for mr.beast to come out of nowhere
10/10 top editing, guide(I think), and stupid meme guy.
Love the quality over quantity thing
eyo hE GOT A WIFE?
I’m pretty sure I’d only make it to his elbows, but I want to give badgur a hug bro
Ey
BASED
Badger is the only YouTuber who I will sit through the promos
everyday we get closer to badjur playing tf2
You should try Northstar client for Titanfall 2. You can make an absolute mess of the game and it’s amazing
"... is packin heat like Alec Baldwin" ☠️☠️☠️
9:27 POSSIBLE JFK REFERENCE?!?
The guy who's voice text was light blue sounds *exactly* like Jeremy Piven
Is this canon?
3:21 why da rock looking like the Czech Republic?
Wait u married
“The rate of everything turns to zero.”  *Not the death rate*
I thinks its cute badger thinks he can destroy SW more then Disney.
Wait badger is married? Huh
"Imma Damn Death Trooper I can be blind In both eyes" and then proceeds to knock the eff outta a normie rebel scum!🤣🤣
bananAnakin  lol
Ima turn Rey into a hot pocket and also blow up yavin 4 all so peanut butter and gasoline
You forgot to mention the sith trooper's grenade is called the "Oppression Grenade."
I love how in every video heavenly is always a meme then back to his cacqdeamon (sorry for incorrectly spelling it) form just to be another meme character
BANANAKIN
So that’s why a killed a dude named Ekaj I thought it was a random trying to look like Ekaj turns out I was wrong well my bad for putting a blue laser beam through your face Ekaj my deepest condolences
if there's not a lot of people playing the 2005 one then you could make your fans play it with you and your friends can play with you too but that's up to you
you could play the 2004 and 2005 version of this game instead of the modern one
MAKE MOAR VIDEOS YOU F@CKING PINEAPPLE
Putting those rebel scum in their place with the newest special ed storm troopers
I no longer have time to eat blink or breathe. When russian badger makes amazing content all the time
16:18 you didn’t say anything you just said fuck a bunch of times and shot people
I wish this game was still being updated
“Has been out for 4 years, has all these problems, and has been abandoned by the developers but is still special” hmmmmmm titanfall 2 intensifies. Anyway all jokes aside the servers for titanfall 2 work again if anybody wants to play
Play tf2 pls :D
That Alec Baldwin and atf shit was top tier
This video is now 4 days old, I just got the fucking notification
Bananakin
Peep Chopper at 15:23
6:29 probably a true statement since nearly 6.1 billion imperials died on the death-star during it's destruction.
This is the Way.
The death trooper is so broken I got a 45 kill streak
part of me wishes badger said to little time roasting ewoks instead of people at 8:16
I just bought a salacious crumb shirt thanks to you lol
I would love to see him play classic battlefront 2.
There was some serious senator Armstrong vibes in this video
there was an american that lived around 730s,or some damn shit ik it was in 700
Badger would Fucken love the allstar from Garden warfare
I see this is the timeline where tombstone let their ship turn to ash on the ocean
sorry 4 days late
Day 4 of asking Russianbadger to play Warframe
Dey put de spdnermrn in der strmwrs
BTW I was to my brother and he called you Roman Beaver
Which special trooper is the master cheif?
alright hes getting a little too good with his mocap suit
Badger has a wife? I didn't even know she existed and now I instantly feel sorry for her being married to the human equivalent of a deep-fried meme.
Brb gonna get permabanned by EA for over modding BF2
10:40 *police siren* Me: oh no
Day 1 of asking badger for a video without a 10 minute monologue
The only reason the fans are still in BF2 is because the title “Star Wars” is on it. You remove that you lose all the fans,
EA just like Valve abandoning a game, leaving the game full of hackers and broken/unbalanced weapons. At least you this game does not have bots, idk if you got community servers.
E
holy shit EA patched the 1hp thing! (I don’t wanna say it was a coincidence or anything but like)
I AM RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT YOU PLAY MORE PAYDAY 2 BECAUSE I LOVE WATCHING YOU PLAY IT
There are custom private servers that allow more mods
Wait badgers married?
appreciate the og star wars battlefront sound effects
BANANIKIN
That mocap suite is practically paying for itself
JUST PLAY ON A PRIVATE SERVICE
I love this
alec baldwin han solo mod
Where not gonna just act like the man didn’t use the OG BATTLEFRONT sounds
Whoa wait Badger where is the end card dialogue
You didn’t say Master chief from fortnite  YOU DESERVE A MEDAL
Play Gungeon plssssss
EA patched the Invincibility glitch after this video. Badger you are god
Day 4 of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
love the scrolling mando'an in the bottom at 0:36
he needs to play war of rights so we can bet on how fast that video gets demonetized
10:32 When Jorge’s shoulder plate is textured properly in a TRB vid but not in Halo Infinite
YES ANOTHER BATTLEFRONT VID
Even tho he was 1 minute off of his sponsor I still enjoyed him making it fun
Damn they got Bananakin Skywalker in the game
I would absolutely love just one video of TheDoo's gang and Badger's guys hanging out. Like, with a sponsor so they can all just go off and commit political war crimes
Its become hard to enjoy badger’s content lately, a few days ago, i tried to have a conversation in his discord server, and i was attacked just because my pfp was a dog, his discord community is more toxic than cardiac glycoscide dioxin (one of the most deadliest poisons on earth). It honestly needs an airing out.
"Ragdolls, it's sponsor time, time to get blown into the atmosphere for a funny bit" "YES BADGEEEER"
I made the mistake of trying to eat a subway sandwich while watching this and almost choked on the dang thing at the whole "unemployment to zero after glassing a planet" part. XD I love your videos, Badger, it's just glorious chaos every time and I love it.
ATF and Alec Baldwin jokes. Nice
Ah yes my favorite Youtuber Russian "slowy makeing his way to holding the world record for largest collection of Selicatius B. Crumb merch ever owned by a single indivual" Badger.
The moar I look at your editing style, the moar I wanna do it like you do. But yours is so good that I won't be able to match your level... Thank you Badge <3
Found this video on my birthday, best gift ever
If you want to have ability changing mods, someone made private servers for BF2 called Kyber. They're fucking amazing
LMFAO!!!! 😂 y’all are funny
People thought badger couldn't pull a girl? He's badger he pulled pussy before he got famous
bananakin skywalker
Russian Badger for President. That cabinet will think outside the box and solve problems. 😎
Thank you Current, very poggers
can we talk about the fact it's 90 gb :(
Me watching theRussianbadger instead of getting A’s in school
Over edited
This guy is literally the definition of quality over quantity.
Bananakin peelwalker
I'm glad people are finally realizing the glory of Salacious B Crumb!
Star Wars being a "protected" franchise is debatable
Someone please tell me all his videos are animated like this
So hitler was fixing unemployment
We just gonna skip over the "chatwhatsyourfavoriteflavorandwhyisitblue?" at 11:53 lmao
The fact is that after 3 days this video has 1.7m views means He makes the highest quality vids
Hey Badger. You know that you can get a LEGO Salicious B. Crumb, right?
I hate mods, they ruin games as hackers
badger plssss play tf2 it will be faantastic
You mean master chief from fortnite? You mean kratos from fortnite? You mean venom from fortnite? You mean lightsabers from fortnite?
If I could I'd download a mod that makes the clone commando look like chief
This guy looks kinda like russian badger
Badger should play hunt showdown, he would wip everyone with shotgun's
Yo those stormtroopers are dancing on Choppers corpse
I KEEP MISSING YOUR STREAMS AHHHHH
Yo badger hit us up with some dying light two, real cringe👌
Next time one the Russian Badger: I subjected my wife to the dipshittery that is my friend group and this is how it went...
WAIT BADGER HAS A WIFE (how am I just now finding this out ;-;;;;)
Mamter Ceif in da Sturr Werz
8:45 is unironically the funniest part
I feel like badger and co. Wouldn’t take away from a Star Wars movie but would rather be the highlight. Kinda like the end credit scenes in marvel they get one or two appearances and everyone goes nuts like, “THATS MY FAVORITE STORMTROOPER!!!”
Badger when the fuck are you gonna make a tf2 video
Isn't this game broken??
Current only for the US.... Why the fuck am I not surprised
6:38 too funny 💀💀
Wait, Badgers' married!? Definitely never saw that coming lol
Badger should play onward on vr that shit would go terrible on escort
I favor the rebels more cause I can pre shoulder people with Han Solo (aka Hanes)
I'll keep it real. I'm not getting a card off the recommendation of any YouTube sponsor. Love the videos tho
ADHD: the youtube video
5:01 Star Wars Canon  5:15 Star Wars Legends  Not saying one is better than the other, but I am saying that if Canon was treated like Legends, Rey would've been trained by Boba Fett in the ways of a Jedi, Palpatine would've blown up a planet with his mind, and a dinosaur with a red lightsaber would walk up to Luke's Jedi Temple and achieve the powers of a god.
His body language really says it all.
Been subscribed to this guy for years, and his production quality is just INSANE
13:42 man turned into James Jonah Jameson
Yes now make a video of battlefront 2005
What happened to R6S
Can you play Titanfall 2
I was actually present for 90% of this stream and was laughing my ass off the whole time.
Seeing more bf2 from you has made my week! I love your videos man and this made me wanna get back on BF2 with the boys. Big big fan thank you badger!
I think Bajur has something for our boy Salacious B. Crumb
Fuck ewoks we rollin wit salacious crumb
I’ve played battlefront 2 for so long I can kill Vader as a standard assault class
Anyone know what that guitar riff Badger uses at 1:35 is? i know its from something but i dont know where.
How the heck does he do this?
honestly I'm just always impressed by all the models he has to work with. this man's fuckin around with every model made in the last sentry meanwhile im over here trying to resist the urge to gouge my eyes out with a straw I found on the side of the road because I cant get the spy from fuckin tf2 into ANYTHING
Can u try play WoT with a guy named OneAndOnly016. He Is a good player and a funny on. it would make my life.
People the scout trop looks got even hes wearing it i mean it good beter than stormtrop
If you ever play again I recommend Chrome Dome, she's a lotta fun
Love the content
I started playing this because of you......right when the glitch where people couldnt die started.......so thanks for that! (no honestly ive been having fun)
instinctively turns down volume
i like how heavenlys model is no goddamn glamrock freddy
Lovely eye shadow, whats ur makeup routine
10:48 Team fortress 2 in a nutshell too....except WAY older
Bro just play titanfall 2
anything is better than bf2042
Bananakin Skywalker let's goooooo
What did I *drink* man?
I Weill continue untill it gets done   R6S when   It’s been quite a few updates
As nice as all this looks; its recycled animations being inserted kinda like any other animation. 'oh high pixel density and smooth animations!' Then you realize how little of the work is actually done by him but is instead reused assets and is actually really cringe Literally every time the head moves its the same shake, the transitions between movement are pretty rough, and its just too damn tryhard and flashy, like this isn't gameplay this is technically a machinima
thank you youtube for showing me the video 3 days after it’s uploaded
Welcome back to another episode of me blocking this shit
Hehehe……….Bananakin
Love your videos Bro
It's scary and surprising how well master chief just fits in this game, he feels like he's actually in the game, like a pc and xbox exclusive dlc.
..Hive fleet take this planet
I will never NOT love the Combine sound effects
Where's that GOYO video I was promised?!
Dude, Lucas ruined the Star Wars franchise long before y’all got your hands on it.You and your friends are just improving it.
Get this man a Kowakian Monkey Lizard puppet stat
That Mo Cap Suit Was HIS BEST Fucking Investment
9:17 was that heavenly’s ma?
Those Alec Baldwin jokes were top tier.
This video feels like an intro the never ends.
Badger, I will never stop buying your Gamer Supps, as long as you never stop making these videos. Deal?
Crumb is now the new meta....well damn
Play tf2 please
i am VERY surprised badger spent that time talking about the Commando's Repulser and DIDNT use the mod that replaces the sound effect for it with a fart.mp3 with reverb
badger's gotta try play some tf2 with the boys. He need to experience how it feels to play casual
Badger: talks about restrictions on his past video Also badger: puts every clip that got him redacted last time into this video This is why I love these videos
I present to you a joke. Ahem.   IFunny
Next time you do a Battlefront 2 video you should try out the Kyber launcher. Would like to see a private Heroes vs Villains game of Banakin vs Vader. Plus it also means you can set up a private server and can play exclusively with fans and you won't have to deal with the 1hp glitch ever again
my guy, 3:40 that click sound affect sounds just like the message notification sound from EFT.
Hey badger you should do a shit post of dying light 2 with your buddies your also the reason I check YouTube every week cause I love your videos.
He missed the chance to put doom slayer in it or mando
The OG Battlefront 2 sound effects in this brings me back!
10:29 goodbye
Use to be a top 100 blaster trooper player on ps4 but those days are long gone.
My favorite koolaid and Gatorade flavor is red because blue is just fucking inferior.
"They put da Mastah Chiiif in the mods"
that was fucking great, lot of laughs
what editing software do you use
Legit whenever the boys and I play first order I just don't even choose the heroes and go straight to a Sith Trooper because they are so much fun to use. One point my mate was Kylo Ren who just froze like 5 enemies and I just glassed them with Sith Trooper secondary fire!
Mods yes, but you forgot the best part of Battlefront 2.  Teddy Bear Fun Time! Styling on a Vader and losing yourself in the dance of sweet victory as an Ewok is pure bliss. Plus you get to throw glowing bees at the elderly. Nub nub motherfucker.
Well now you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6UokEA_3ck
Wait who's married? badger??
After 3 months *HE IS BACK*
Can't believe the Vegas video got age restricted I can't watch it anymore
Real gun and fake gun 🤍❤💙
It amazes me that some pathetic individuals are going around reporting badger's videos.
Who flamethrower
(8:00) The badger talks about all the exploits and how the developer's abandoned the game. TF2: Pathetic.
ITS OVER BANANAKIN I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
Are you gonna play halo Infinite? That'd be cool.
Well, i didn't know they added the Titan Shoulder Charge from Destiny into Star Wars Battlefront 2.  Very cool.    Also, we guardians shall be waiting for your cringe on the 22nd when the Witch comes a knocking with our light.
FYI World of tanks is BS
You did it badger, you indirectly bullied a triple A company into fixing their game.
Bf2 is way better on console
1:07 can't ruin what's already ruined.
1:20 I love how we get “Gregory” and there is no further fnaf speak
hey badger when are you maikng a world of warships?
I would literally pay to see Badger's crew interrupt any of the sequel movies with their usual bullshit.  It might actually make me appriciate the Disney sequels. Just a bit.
Badger should make a video on TF2, i can't imagine the funny moments
Good video, but needs more Selacious Crumb
Badger I missed you 😭
"most protected franchise on the planet" Sorry Me going angry boi. TELL THAT TO DISNEY! Twats screwed it over.
Good lord I wasn't expecting ATF jokes here but I'm glad they are here
I would imagine Russianbadger in a star wars movie. He be in the background and talking to other storm troopers about all sorts of stuff like how glassing a planet would be great for planet hunger.
WORN GLAMROCK FREDDY FAZBEAR POINTING AT ME AND CALLING ME CRINGE IN ABOUT A MILLISECOND IS THE *H I G H L I G H T* OF MY FUCKING YEAR
Russian badger videos are just endless introductions. All the best bits
You are truly the meme king my friend
wow i reinstalled and went back to playing bfII just a few days before this was out, great timing
Really need more of the mods for left for dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’d play as master chief honestly shot would be great lol
When Rey was in the microwave they said it'll be black...         69
I mean my Canadian debit card can do all that shit too and we've had tap payments for like the last 10 years. Meanwhile, when I pay for a meal in America they take my card and write down the number on a napkin.
Hey badger do you think that you could play R6 extraction
“Why Is Fucking Skywalker a Banana”  I AM CRYING 😂
You should do a video on republic commando
No moar Badger
Me playing as a death trooper:yea mom I go pick you up after I destory the rebels
Are we gonna get a video of how the mocap works in editing? Like how you mocap more than one person.
Bananakin Skywalker?  That's it. I'm returning to Monke. There is nothing else the internet can offer me that can top that.
drinking guacamole gamer fart 9000 while watching this
This was 90% goofing around in vr and 5% gameplay. Don't ask about the 5%
i love how easy you can bypass age restrictions.🤣
le exit
Imma tune in once he gets a hairline
U should look up kyber
You should play deep rock galactic I think it would make an awesome video.
This guy makes sponsors amazing. Holy sheet
Gonna be real heavy can deal with anything below 500 health with smart movement (in a 1v1)
It's a K-saber @ 2:17
Badger's sponsor allowing you to do things that are standard with Australia's banks
This man has one of the half of Team fortress 2 players, their either complete shitters or try hards, he is the shitter of the shitters.
why the fuck does this look so good?
Badger never disappoints with his videos
badger is like crack cocaine for my brain
Is heavenly actually good?
“Prank ‘em Alec!” *”YOU ALREADY KNOW”*
depressed its only 16 minutes but its badger so ik its gonna be a banger
Drinking anything while watching this is a mistakr
I want to see badger as an actual stormtrooper in an actual movie and threaten to turn a jedi into hot pocket
Wait....BADGERS FUCKING MARRIED????
love that sound at 11:55
badger's married..?
Badger
bro hes stalling and putting so much useless ass screentime
The one way to solve the unemployment... Glass Yavin 4. Seems like a legit business strategy  China enters the chat
What are you smoking and where can I get some
The moral of the story is everything is better when you have a great friend group.
Should someone tell him the game is apparently getting fixed monday
I never knew how much I needed Bananakin Skywalker until today
Alternate Universe where Badger and his crew are apart of the Star Wars Series
the devs finally said something and posted that they would be fixing the server issues, hopefully
dog.  make a gmod video.
Salacious crumb is my new favorite star wars character baby Yoda close second
bruh my wife just said his hairline make him look like Magneto. She then proceeded to show me examples of why she thinks that. I am dead. Great vid though!
As someone who has played this game so much I am so happy that you have been playing this game more. This game definitely has flaws but it is super fun. The republic commando is definitely an extremely fun character.
Am I the only one who wants to skip the sponsored segment but doesn’t want to miss all the funny stuff during it
13:32 Never thought I would see the Gun That Can Kill The Past in 3D. Wonder where Badger got it from.
Not gonna lie... If 343 ever made a game like this game but set in the halo universe... I'd play it. With ALL creatures taken into account.
i regret to inform you, crumb died in the movies. 😪
They Bring A lot of Jobs To The Community....LMFAO
Saying he took a sponsorship plug to put food on his table and still make his edgy jokes, and then immediately blow it all on assorted salacious crumb items is the most badger thing I've ever had the fortune to witness
John Souls would 100% curb stomp rey
I didn’t think I was going to accidentally find the best youtube channel today…its only down hill from here…
I’m waiting for TF2
This is why I wish I have friends who played games together. Even a monthly gamenight to just screw around xD
Alec Baldwin was the enemy spy, badger figured it out
This is the way
If you want to please play some more enlisted I think some of us would like to see that.
BADGER CAN U PLZ MAKE A VIDEO ON TF2
Bro I swear badger kills himself in every video and I don’t know why
Thank you badger you're the reason why Can kill tanks and planes in WT with a crying seal
Every badger video is a good time vibe.  That's it. That's all. Thought ended.  God bless.
WTF Badger is married? Subbed.
Badger I will literally do your dishes if you do more battlefront 2 🙏
i just really want to know how he makes the quirky animations.. literally defining his brand
i think bager would like Flores in siege
Why is Freddy here? He’s in the wrong place
Finally something good happened today for me
Congrats on the marriage bro
https://youtube.com/shorts/noS_-bXxZ5Q?feature=share
Did they just say MARRIED!? One of them is married!? That sounds improbable.
Funniest clip ever. "Bite my shiny metal as"
im so confused how badger got sponsored by a debit card
3:55 my eyes
The game is so much fucking fun, the lighting and sound design really elevates it, and the maps in my opinion are really special and they just funnel everyone onto the points and people have huge battles its great
i subbed to u 3 times dawg
Bout to change the pH scale to "Based" and "Cringe." Then litmus test the water you're all drinking.
Amazing
8:55 Best part 100%.
Yo wait, when tf did Badger get married? Like, I knew he had a gf but I didn't know they were married!
"Open the fucking door" opens door That guy just can't wait to have his ass torched 😂😂😂😂🤣
A whole month for 1 video, okay. I like badger but damn
I have to wonder during the scene when they were talking abt badgers wife that she got into the suit for the woman in the background
Then I guess I’m darth jjj
I'm literally lvl like 400 with the heavy class but in the teens for everything else.
Wait badger you never used the clone commandos? Holy god dude you gotta play republic commando at some point if you ever feel like it
10:29   "Hello Mario."
Badger, I'm 8 minutes in to this 16 minute video and we've yet to actually get to the part where you're playing Battlefront 2. This is just you describing having a fun time with your friends, but then the actual fun-times are cutaway gags in your monologue. This is why the 100% funny juice videos are popular - they're just compilations of all of the good parts of your content. It's feeling more and more like the videos you put on Youtube are just advertisements for your live streams. Shit sucks. Fix it if you want I guess. Seems like this soulless format is working pretty well for you.
Sorry I'm three days late but i can't be the only one excited for a new video for Therussianbadger
Now draw him getting me a pack of newports
The funniest joke out of this video was badger thinking EA will ever give a shit about their old games and them getting hacked. It's happened so many times. Battlefield hardline, titanfall 1 and 2, battlefront 2, they just dont give a shit about anything but apex legends
The guys did it They made a better end to the sequels lmao
Haha badger you should send me rent for the month that would be so funny hahaha
This is the most ambiguous cross-over event in history. I give my stamp of approval.
Weed is not Kegan in South Dakota recreational yet our governor keeps shooting it down but the people here did vote for it though
Bananakin Skywalker made me spit out the drink I didn’t even have in
Abandoned by the developers and full of hackers?  Ah, the TF2 experience comes to other games now.
I wonder how you guys could do in the current state of Team Fortress 2. Still popular as ever but still overrun with bots and eastern europeans.
For the Master chief mod what character does he replace?
badger wht the fuck man why is there just mandoa all over the bottom. smh i thought you knew star wars better though I do have to say i liked the original swbf2 sound effects from the menu you used when counting cameras.
go play tf2
13:06
My lungs hurt after laughing so much!! XD  Quick edit : That laser you're using at 12:13 is basically the Star Wars version of an M203 grenade launcher.
Haven't been liking the vids lately, but this one's pretty good.
I think im blessed.  Everytime i check badgers channel for a new video he releases one the day after.
How to market a credit card, either,  A: actual marketing with a strong commercial B: SALACIOUS CRUMB
are you telling me johnatham halo isnt from fortnite?
My actual name is Alec so when I was half focused on it for a min I hear "Prank him, Alec" it messed with me
Badger just cause 3 video
EA couldnt have done us all a favor and just give the game to someone who WOULDNT abandon it and leave it unpatched? -_-
Badger tf2 vid rn
Badger shoot a gun irl
I wish battlefront was still up and running
Badger I’m in severe debt
Badger do my taxes
Badger Gregory
Badger half life mods
I had to sit through a H&R Block ad and it sounded like star dew valley and I think someone will appreciate it
Badger
Badger basketball 1v1 irl vs the game
Badger noodle game
Badger fnaf vr help wanted speed run drunk
Badger Minecraft bed wars video right fucking now.
There is so much going on, I can’t watch this shit
Starts 4:40
Badger: plays death trooper Also badger: complains about hero classes being op
0:26 BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOURE THE ONE GETTING SMOKED, GOBBY!!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Their laughter is contagious
Where is the Marvel vs Capcom video badger
Hey bager there still sell your croc skin on tabg
finally got to try your guacamole gamer fart 9000 and I love it badger it's the prefect amount of lemon since I have this powder that I normally mix with water when I'm sick or have a cold that is suppose to help with it but the taste just ruined the 2 lemon flavors gamer supps has but the lemon in your flavor is prefect I'll be getting more when I run out though considering I just got it like what a month ago and how long one tub of 100 servings last I'll have it for a long time
I put up with a lot of shitposts, but that was a legit accident due to props not doing their job. Alec Baldwin accidentally killed someone because the QA supervisor for the blanks quit and instead of getting someone to fill in for her they just went ahead and used the uncleared gun.
I have lost braincells           And i like it
I have the scout trooper w/ shock stick model as a black series figure, search it up it’s the exact same thing
The fact that badgers playing this game is hilarious me and my friends literally all just got back into it like a week before he posted this video
YES BATTLEFRONT 2!!!
I wish they didn’t stop working on this game it still has potential. Or even a battle front 3. We need space battles on the way up to the drednughts and venedors.
Like for the atf joke
another example of Badger's early onset dementia makes an appearance at the end lol
This saved battlefront ,do you think you could make a video on titanfall 2 🙏
Lolacois crumb will one day rule this earth
please for the love of everything good do a video on TF2 please i beg of thee
Gregory let's go shit post
schill
Foolish Badger, ya cannot ruin SW more than it already is. Do your funny words, mocapped man!
Who’s here still waiting for badger to try borderlands ?
Seeing Rey BBQ'd is the greatest depiction of gender equality.
Why did I hear "Tactical Luke, INCOMING!"
I don't think Stellaris is Badgers jam when it comes to games, but it literally encourages you to unlock colossus planet killer ships to glass/infect/shield/drown planets for the economy. Way more fun modded, as well.
I couldn't care less about a lot of games you play and despite it your videos don't fail to make my day :,) Thank you Badger
Badger return to battlefield 2042 and let's see if you still don't care
I can't even skip the ad reads because everything is so entertaining about this channel
you guys should try moviebattles 2
Death Trooper gang
More, give me more
Finally some recognition for battlefront 2
Guys. I think he likes salacious crumb
You can actually join modded private servers, with modded heroes and stuff like that, without risk of being banned by EA
Badger intro Bingo: Cut off Scream Mismatched SFM Model Someone gets shot Gun used for comedic purpose Badger throwing shade at himself Cut-ins by the crew Smooth moves
Every single country wordwide: NO!! You can't just glass a fucking planet to drop unemployment rates to zero! That's a horrible idea! Exterminatus Nuke from orbit: Hehe... planet go **BOOM!** **Earth explodes**
Bruh idk if this has been said before but during your ad segment all I could think is you could cosplay Senator Armstrong.
Soo thats what he was doing on his stream.
Boomer
badger should try the movie battles 2 mod for jedi academy
2:31 Scarry to think that the way Master Chief is moving in battlefront is lore accurate.
Everybody gangsta till the stormtroopers start storming the trenches with a vlammenwerfer...
Yoo wtf I got unsubscribe from badger why?
You better have written off all that Salcious Crumb merch off as a business expense
Badger making a whole video basically gushing about how much he appreciates his friend group is so adorable
10/10 for funny content
The suit part looks animated!
*One of the most protected franchises on the planet* Kathleen Kennedy, J.J Abrams, and Ryan Johnson: “Allow is to introduce ourselves.”
I love how I always expect to have great content and there's just Bananakin in this and other stuff. Keep up the great work and madness, Badger!
Best thing to happen to starwars in the past 10 years.
Pure chaos but like, the good kind.
It's only gonna take a matter of time for when badger mods payday 2
Bro don’t even try to play online because you can’t no I mean you mean you really can’t    I hate the 1hp bug
7:09 success ..with increasing of space debris XD
Bananakin Skywalker
Praise God! God Bless!➕🎄
BANANAKIN SKYWALKER
Next Payday video when?
"ITS MASTER FUCKIN CHIEF!?!!" Yeah that's the appropriate reaction lol PS Pro tip if you play this on console you don't have to deal with ha led bullshit. I play it regularly on my XSX and have zero issues.
This dude: Brings his friends for everything he does giving them exposure to his audience.  Genuinely uses the products or programs that sponsor him. Acknowledges the regular folks who support him, especially when they do something awesome or really amazing.  Plays on public servers so regular folks get a chance to potentially interact with him in a real game. Takes at least a month to put together quality content that makes us eager to see what he cooks up next.  Badger is a true man of the people who cares about his channel, his supporters, and his audience.  I have the utmost respect for you brother.
Literally playing battlefront 2 when I found this video
The One-health hack is actually a glitch made when SWB2 was made to work with Epic Launcher. There is going to be a patch for the glitch coming out in a week or so. So by 2/12/22 it should be fixed.
Well, how about someone mod Doomguy with the Crucible into Battlefront?
I agree that anyone that say "Like ______ from fornite?" deserves a bullet.
You know  There Is a mod for a pope with lightsaber
The troopers talking and moving and shooting in the background (not the game) are so cool damn
Badger is just Deadpool for YouTube….not the hero we need but the hero we deserve
Go ahead, pause the video, you can’t get un -flashbanged by words
I am blind in my right eye in real life.
badger i know im an idiot but could you play Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
Rainbow Six Extraction exists. All of the og characters from r6 siege are there. When you die you become dangerously cheesy. Alien apocalypse.
Badger be like "aight fuck it bananakin skinwalker".
I literally just started playing this game again a few days before this video...   Badger please stop watching me.
@TheRussianBadger, the Sith Trooper’s explosive laser bolt is basically a homing missile.  Was this intentional, or nah?
Half Life Synergy with all the boys?
Bro, kool-aid jammers are real life Estus Flasks and you cannot tell me otherwise
16:28 This is my battlefront experience in a nutshell just a clown walking around in the middle of a galactic scale war.
He needs to play Jedi fallen order
moar badger
This video just got recommended to me and Im rethinking life right now, I don't know what's going on here
The dog opening the door for the ATF bit had me in tears holy shit :D
No one else think that you could totally tank like 90% of the weapons in starwars....with just like a big mirror?
Hell yea
love you badger
Badger… blink twice if current is holding you hostage
8 whole cameras for the intro, should’ve had more
It's over bananakin. I have the high ground
bananakin 7:39
If fortnite were to be added to fortnite its gonna a big debate of the future generation wether its a jojo reference or a fornite skin
when you get battlefront 2 on xbox and find out xbox online severs are dead for battlefront 2
I didn’t expect to be flash banged, by stray laser fire Lost it, to the backdropped Sith Trooper duo  “Your behaviour frightens and confuses me, sir” - Commando
this person got me into left 4 dead 2 because the way he described l4d2 is so perfect
Is the 1hp bug still present in the game?
I want to be reincarnated as an Ewok just to be cut in half by spider man with a lightsaber
Let's appreciate the dance in the credit, guys XD
This is what I needed. All the added affects are amazing, I can't get enough. God tier.
I'd be so much happier if Rey got grilled in the force awakens
sleep well bro
So proud of Badger for including a Waco joke…. The world is good now.
pls make apex or titanfall2 video plsss
The IBS agent can take down x-wings with her homing blaster shot. I legitimately sat at spawn and took down x-wings for an entire game.
BANANAKIN IS CANON
Can't wait for the private servers where you can actually play all the characters.
they put mamshtber chefde in thw satr wrs
Badger & Co. gotta do TF2
Damn I might redownload this
Hey noah
This was good
The best in the biz. GUAC GAMER 9K is life BYW.
this game went straight to the dumpster when I heard they were going to stop support after the half assed OT update. How could they leave the game unfished in the state it was. original trilogy doesn't even have a capital ship phase. Rebels don't have a tank to counter the atst.... Ewoks are garbage so basically rebels are handicapped. Like come on finish your damn game lazy EA. And they cut support for this game to make battlefield 2042..... Great another piece of trash. Won't be long when Dice gets closed.
Amazing Performance https://youtube.com/shorts/s_ZzWkGiOoo?feature=share
2:10 [ZF]Digitalvagrant: *Exists in this video* Me: Is this a crossover episode? Are we gonna have a SovietWomble and RussianBadger collusion video next?
This one felt to Hevy on the animatid segments. I was expecting more gameplay segments
>did you lose anyone?  >BITCH THEY BLEW UP THE WHOLE PLANET
i think Badger's a facist
badger looking like my history professor
Can't believe people watch this shit. It's like a really bad Red vs Blue
Wait,  burger man is married?
If star wars ever gonna make a series or a movie about stroomtooper they should cast badger and the boys
anyone know 5:02 storm trooper type? I need to know lol
12:03 me when i steal an nft
Wait who got da wife?
"Yeah whatever bro, free Tay-K" LMAOOO
8:53 dude that's so fucked... someone ACTUALLY died XD
Wait badgers married?!
Master chief with Kirby is so damn adorable
May I ask you playing the new rainbow six game
Yo Badger please put more scenes of rei gettin roasted
FOR THE EMPIRE     (Also this guys got a gun clip 8:45)
dude, my friends are so bad to play with. can i leave them and play with you now
Another fine addition to my collection
camo commando gang
Why is it that when I get back into playing a game all of a sudden 3 of my favourite youtubers make a video on it
9:21 they use items from tf2 they even talk about tf2 yet no tf2 video
Didn't expect Alec Baldwin jokes here.
moar badger
Anakin as a banana is the best thing I have ever seen
Considering your astronomical production value. I'd love to see that you could do with tf2 or overwatch models
Suggestion: Insurgency Sandstorm
I got my big rig stuck and I’m laughing my ass off at my favorite YouTuber. Life has never sucked more and been more awesome at the same time
What is up with the enchantment table language in the captions in the beginning
This video is more entertaining than the book of boba fett. More videos with bf2! It needs more casuals to dilute the sweats😂
10:47 badger explaining tf2 same problem and how its still around
Robot chicken vibes
no mention of kyber, where you can run A C T U A L mods.
6:00 better ending than that whole shit show
EA:  I’m gonna do a pro game publisher move.
Dude what’s that sound effect from at 2:59 when he changes I don’t remember it but I’ve 100% heard it from somewhere
THEY ARE PUTTING BRUNO MARS IN FORTNITE
I can just imagine you making a collab with zanny and I love it
Wait wait wait...... Bananakin
10:50 proceeds to schadenfreude
16:23 bro badger pulled a real life Bop It lol   If you get it you get it , if you don’t you don’t, I’m not explaining.
4:01  You got that shit signed?!?!?! Lucky bastard...
Best content creator around bager be on level 5000!
2 days over a million views on a gaming video, well done BadjuR!
what 16 minuets of this gold bullcrap man
Lol calling BF2 fundamentally broken after saying battlefield 2042 is fine… why do I even watch this content
I literally watched badger since the days of battlefield 3 and honestly seeing his descent into utter madness. FASCINATING.
Badg I love these vids but all the sweats get back on when you make them😂
Ultimate Shitpost
Im convinced badger just likes shooting himself in mocap
You know its a badger video when your laughing before the little intro card
God, that loading screen is so polished
SHEEEEEEEEEEEESH that shirt drippy
This is the 599th video! Happy to be along the journey!
Never would I'd imagine seeing Bananakin Skywalker in, well, anything tbh
Mentions that it's only because of his friends that battlefront is fun, but never mentioned that during his bf 2042 video.
Bro why is half the video just explaining the video
Wait when he hears of Payday mods
I like how badger blatantly makes fun of his friends financial struggles, and actively laughs about it, the best of friends
Hey badger you should absolutely do resident evil resistance.
*Petition for badger to do a team fortress 2 video:*  *1 Iike = 1 signature*
God that republic commandos voice line just threw me back like a cannonball
6:50 Hey Badger, guess what, did you know Vlad the Impaler did exactly what you said here? Infamously, he rounded up all the poor people, inviting them to a feast in a barn then closing the barn on them and burning them alive inside the barn. Fucked up, right? Well, not in the eyes of many Romanians to this day. They say he "eradicated poverty" and called him a great man. Somebody should probably tell them that's fucked up, right? But it shouldn't be an American that does it. For... reasons.
You can use kyber private servers for no hackers and gameplay changing mods
Dude you’re getting demonetise for that Alec Baldwin joke lol 😂
Cool bug facts one day you will have to answer for your actions and God may not be merciful
One thing about Badger is he knows how to make the longest intros. Thank God he isn't a director, he'd blow the budget on 1h50mins worth of opening credits before you even see the title of the movie you're watching.
Ah yes, bananakin
Should be called empire starts crying
Bananakin Skywalker
Bruh
Don’t make me re download battle front again
you guys playing BF2 feels like fucking Bad Company 3 and I am all for it
You gave me a POV camera wtf! *Proceeds to die from too much smoke* fucking pussy we don't coughs here!
no idea why you hid your real name on the card lol its all over the internet
I love how you guys used the old Battlefront 2 sound effects into this.
Wait, Badger’s married?
Hey, ever considered playing deceit on steam? It's a great game and I think it would be fun for you to play
10:30 for my memory
I remember playing with the neighbour's kid this game in his basement in 2017. he was a big fan of the star wars franchise in general. good times. thanks for making them comback. also I spammed the hell out of the flame trooper. defenatly the best unit out there
Give it some time and Badger just fuckin revives bf2
Badger has wife?
I think I’m losing brain cells bc I actually couldn’t understand but after the third time I think my mind melted enough to where I understood
I called the clone trooper who can knock people back the Jedi slayer sometimes because I have used him to kill Darth Maul’s
You know that scene in the first Sam Rami spider-man movie were the girl points up and says "it's spider-man" in like 2 seconds? Well I need that scene but with russianbadger 2:01
In a good way
I’ve been watching since 1 mil and you are still the same
9:25
Badger dropping Republic commando cameos is all I needed this month. I’m set
My god badger please do more i cant stop laughing lmao
I got to say the quality of the mocap animations has gone through the roof, those little skits you make in sfm look fantastic.
"Protected" was the only accurate word in that whole description of Star Wars under Disney's care. otherwise, this vid is fun as hell. keep doing you!
wait badger is married??
Is the next video the 600th video?
Fun fact: it is confirmed that shaggy from Scooby-Doo is a jedi
9:45
Badger siege videos hit different
Bro you even make the SPONSER SEGMENTS enjoyable 🤣
I'm still convinced that your plastic man.
Badger you should make a video on hell let loose
why yall gotta hate on fruit punch
I have never seen anyone have such a boner for salacious b crumb jesus.
Ah yes.. Sith troopers and their literal OPPRESSION GRENADES
🤣
Bruuuuhhhhh... not using, _"Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!!!"_ was such a missed opportunity... 😔
"You  can't glass a fucking planet and say I solved the unemployment problem." 40k's Imperium of Man: _"That's where you're wrong bucko."_
pleas for the love of god play tf2 on stream its the dummst shit iv seen
These 2 time stamps here: 2:09 - 1:59 (Specifically in that order btw)  They work, perfectly...dont believe me? Try it yourself...  Edit: maybe just use the 1:59 tab, BEFORE, the 2:09 tab finishes...
You should do more r6
Why in the flying fuck... Has Badger not made a TF2 video yet? Ya knows it's going to be worth it.  P.S. unban me from Badger discord server, I'm sorry Heavily didn't like my joke but the dude can suck a fat nut. It was a joke lol
I've literally watched this 50 times
You used to be funny
4:50 Moments before disaster
badgers's forehead rinkles are starting to look like snow jacket
This is some top tier shit
This seems like a thinly-veiled advertisement for Salacious Crumb merchandise
WOOOOOOOO YEAAHHHH BABYYYYYY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT WOOOOO
Loving that there are literally 0 dislikes on this video, pure bliss
But your the only one getting smoked
6:15 now I want a five minute short of the boys in trooper uniform in a conference room discussing the economy of the empire and deciding “yeah, let’s blow SH** up. It’s good for unemployment rates”
Wait badger wife ayo sus
This is a great channel! I only caught sight of you folks in recent times, but it’s now among my favourite channels. 🔥
Attention Gamers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXfUUXN-aXw&t=13s
I just straight up died from laughing this was hilarious
try PVZ GW2
BADGERS BACK BABYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!
Ok, but the Master Chief mod is pretty cool
Also when does he stream? PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW
I have a recommendation for a collaboration…. The Boys+TheRussianBadger.
Badgers upload schedule is about as stupid as his videos.
I think his next vid is halo infinite
16:06 my pc after just running tf2
THEY PUT THE MASTER CHIEF ON THE BATTLEFRONT
servers so bad badger had to do the whole video in coop only reason i know is because of the enemy names
First time seeing badger boys .. we found our actor for vegeta
beans
Is nikacado just therussianbadger but he ate a bit too much glue?
I remember playing this in 2017
2:22 guacamole gamer fart 9000
Badger talking about the republic command made me want see a video about the game Star Wars Republic Commando
You killed Rey and your friends mocked the ATF all in one video. Truly Based.
Bro why do you almost look somewhat like the holodoctor from Voyager?
This content is always good
Two vids in a month what?
Hey is your name Shaun?
He turned himself into a banan that's the funniest shit I've ever seen.
Nah, no way EA is gonna ban you for modding. They let somebody make it so that the AI can’t die and kept it in the game
7:20 tornike zd
*Epic*
The Alec Baldwin joke got me
Don’t worry about fucking up battlefront 2 shit was already fucked
1:07 i don't think you can make it any worse XD
I think the biggest plot twist of the RussianbadgerCU is that Badger used to work in finance
They actually fixed the 1 health exploit
Wait, Bader's married? Dead ass? I only watch his YouTube vids. So that's on me. Last thing I remember, he had an Asian gf sometime ago that liked Pikachu or somn. lmao
Omg the original battlefront two ui select sound everytime the camera changes is such a fucking minor thing and I really hope that's what it is or I'm going insane
Banakin ripwalker should be a meme
Took me a while to figure out why Anakin was made into a banana. Bananakin. Got it.
So....how’s Battlefield 2042?
*distant buckshot from mandalorian*
Life.... finds a way
Ever played SCP sl? I'm sure there is some funny to be found there.
I got my medical license. The legalization joke got me lmao
There have been mods since they added scarif, so probably a few years now
I play heavy bruh reg gun suck but his mini gun thing is insane
I've been in too many hacked lobbies that I just uninstalled the game and moved on to EFT
oh shit PSA EA IS FIXING THE 1 HP bug soon so maybe we can see badger obliterate some ewoks in a starfighter
“Fuck it, we ball”- Michael Crow
2:12 bananakin skywalker
so uh... when are we getting a tf2 video?
Bananakin Skywalker is the ideal mod for Battlefront II
6:19 The Imperial Inquisition in a nutshell
This game has been dead since it came out. It’s fun don’t get me wrong. BUT IT NEEDS MAJOR UPDATES
Have I really been watching this bitch for 4 years
Master chief do you mind telling me what you are doing in Battlefront 2
Do pubg next
I need to see badger play vrchat with his motion capture
Aye bruh play Titanfall 2
I wonder if we’ll ever see badger post a tf2 video
He has too many hats. he is spy.
Was darth Vader wearing Tim’s in that one scene?
Play risk of rain 2 you wont regret it and its moddable
Bro I cant sign up because its too short even tho I put 04 its takes away the 0 bro
Ayo spider man is a jedi
play Rising Strom 2 Veitnam one time for the meme
hey badger, what master chief mod is that? i wanna download it
Yes our monthly badger upload
Hey badger I would love if you make a video of deep rock galactic
Im' no't going to lie bana saber look like bitcher knife.
Found you on trending and I apparently woke up my ma with sneaky goblin snickers
Day three of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
Can we appreciate the fact this man has been posting videos for 11 years?
Man I love seeing glamrock freddy point at me then call me cringe
Really sucks that EA abandoned this game for 2042  The game was finally starting to actually get good before they stopped updates, we were gonna get Ahsoka. I fucking miss this game but I can't play it thanks to someone fucking up the PC servers
Too bad the game is hacked to hell and back outside of kyber modded lobbies
Reported for click bait, you said you would talk about current in two minutes. It has been 3 minutes and you finally start talking about it. Good luck getting paid shitter (takes the L)
I have a feeling Badger's next video will be Halo Infinite
https://youtu.be/Ta3wdzBvfus
the Bananakin Skywalker skin killed me
Bananakin
@TheRussianBadger You should check out the Star Wars mod for Squad. It slaps harder than an ex that I just can’t shake
I was just playing TitanFall 2 and I got a DM from another player who was a ronin main that said “I bet you live in Ohio because you melee fight like you spend Saturday nights in a rural bar.”  And as someone who’s an Ohioan who lives in a rural town I took that as a compliment.
0:22 I live in Canada so that ain't news to me bro.
How'd you find a server?
just cause of this video imma replay battlefront 2  how do i get these mods tell me
Listen dying light with mods
They solved world hunger by blowing up world
One time I downloaded a fnaf security breach mod for battlefront and it turned boba fett into fkn Burntrap and darth vader into fkn Montgomery gator,and a bonus mod was included and it turned the Death trooper into doom slayer, funniest shesh I've ever seen.
weeder-man. the new weed based superhero that flings his drug webs to swing past buildings, intoxicating the villains into submission and then he sends them to jail, with his more humanly accepted form being: some random drug dealer living in Ohio

Badgers slowly dying like arthor from rdr2 every video the cough gets worse.
6:50  You can’t just glass a planet just because of unemployment!
Badger, please, for the love of god, do 2v2’s heroes, it would be the biggest shitpost to shit on your friends (or be shitted on)
Baldwin didn't study his lines, he was already to shoot
actually weed I'm new york isn't just medical use anymore
imagine if Current buys the rights to make Salacious Crumb their mascot just because of this video
You know...I'm just waiting for the day when badger makes a fucking Arma 3 operation video in a shitpost formont and then at that point.... in the next twitch stream I'm selling my soul so I can gift Subs
I don't even skip his ad reads because they are still funny and don't really rip you from the vibe of the video
Alec Baldwin jokes start. Me: Whelp. Guess this one's getting demonitized too. lol
Badger should check out far cry 6
THEY’RE MAKIN’ ME CRINGE, DUTCH
I'm guessing the 1hp hack/glitch is a thing only on PC? Because I have yet to happen to me on PS4.
I don’t know if you will read this Russianbadger but can you make another left 4 dead 2 video pls
Honestly I really want badger to try heroes vs villains it’ll be funny af
will alec baldwin get a +30 xp assist in the center of his vision when the other person he injured dies.
im so glad this man was born he just made my day :)
You should play DRG
Badger you should try fortnite again your other fortnite videos were so good
Yoooooo
Starwars IP was remorcelessly fucked by the release of the prequals. I'm sorry man G E O R G E beat you to it
salaous crub give away
2:10 bananakin skywalker
Ruh roh Raggy, radgers married
Sadly, Current is USA only.
Oh God, what would happen if Badjur and the squad discovered Kyber servers are a thing now?...
Hey badger you should totally  play dying light 2
Hi
“Pranc him Alec”
kyberclient man you should do it!
So this is where peter was when he got snapped
HE'S A MENICE A THIEF AND BRING MORE PICTURES OF SPIDER MAN
bet you don't have the salacious crumb mighty bean
Oh, you play fortnite? -kys- Name every crossover
0:34 Oh hey. Imperial Navy Commandos.
WAIT, Badger is married? I always thought he has been secretly dating Jessika Van since 2014.... (voice actor for Huang Shuyi in BF4...)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆
What do you animate with??
Ironic, considering Jabba the Hutt did own slaves
https://youtu.be/NW55qxXXECs
Was NOT ready to be blinded by that receding hairline gawd dayum
My guy badger really said packing eat like Alec Baldwin 💀 he’s so getting demonitized
Packing heat like Alec Baldwin 🤣
Could you give me financial advice? Like where to put 1000 dollars?
is this a movie or a game?
Interesting. So me and my friend group weren't the only ones to get sucked back into this game. Its almost as if a higher power made it happen. Something that flows through all of us. Guides us.
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

Badger, I'd pay top dollar for a star wars animated/blender mini-movie from you, cause I'm bingeing your videos animations alone, the jokes and commentation just add on to the sheer quality
I know it ain't his sort of thing, but an all out animated battle would be fun to watch, even it it was like only a minute

Basically, don't hand Biden a Deathstar.
12:10 yo he killed Reeech
Wow bottom text amirite
Jokes aside, Battlefront 2 2017 is by far the best battlefront game. Way better than the 2005 game.
I really wanna see ma main man badger play one of the Dying Lights, especially co-op, imagine all of em dropkicking random zombies
dey put da mamstur cheif in da star wars
Where did you get the mandalorian model?
Do aTeam fortress 2 video
God dammit badger I just uninstalled this game and now i wanna play it, badger is such a good salesman.
I mean, you guys can't ruin Star Wars anymore than EA and Disney have.
These comments..... WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT BANANKIN SKYWALKER!!!!!!???????
You should try out the gameplay mods on the private servers. If you liked how the Sith Trooper and First Order Air Trooper play then there's more where that came from
Bananakin Skywalker isn't something I thought I needed to see....
Y'know badger, the original battlefront 2 is on steam and is exceptionally moddable. To the point of changing how the game works
I'm disappointed that no one talked about the Sith Trooper's Oppression Grenade
Bless he is back
Wait, Jabba’s little pet has a name!? I thought it was just an unnamed puppet
There needs to be a mod that just paints the b-2 a goblin green and yellow that would be stupid but amazing
Ain’t even a meme, badger has a wife?
Glamrock Freddy appearing for a single frame to say Gregory really made me choke on my drink
Should i start playing bf2?
If Badger likes the Jet Tackle just wait till he learns about Titans in Destiny 2
5 min in and I haven’t cracked a smile… snooze.
"Badger your blind in your left eye"  Me, literally blind in my left eye: Brother! I found you!
Fuck Youtube, all my homies hate Youtube
video is just: funny vegeta man talks about they economy while roasting a company while doing drugs with the empire
What’s your moniter
And not even one MASTA CHEF N DA SODA
Star wars Battlefront 2 return of the cringe
You should do one on Titanfall 2. It’s incredibly chaotic and it seems perfect for this channel.
Video Idea : World of Tanks but you play wheeled tanks and never stop pressing W. CALL THAT SHIT W KNIGHT RISES
What happened to Cacodemon Evenly
Badger is the monthly subscription of happy hormones being injected into my brain
wait is badger married?
What i have just watched has  killed 800 to 10 000 brain cells and i still wanna play
Eyo R6 Extraction is out. I think there is a lot of bs to explore in that game :D
Slavic Wolverine
do ds3
YAY A NEW BADGER VIDEO :D
and me silly goose thought i watched this vid already
A normal Citizen on Aug 6, 1945- "Ah, What a beautiful Day. I wonder what the weather will be lik-" 0:01
This made my day so much better. Thank you badger.
Two things: 1) Yes, there are some bots in Supremacy to fill out the number of enemies on the map 2) Some modders released an amazing thing called Kyber awhile ago that allows for private matches and game changing mods in a multiplayer setting. This allows for new reinforcements, new weapons, balance changes, new heroes, and more to be added to the game. It even has an official modpack for trying out a collection of cool mods.
Its treason then
dude, please talk about the arc trooper.
@TheRussianBadger I think your video got Dice to notice and fix that exploit.
play tf2
How do we not have badger playing TF2 yet?
Please play TABS from landfall
Funny to see battle front 2 has the same problems that battle front 1 had when it first came out 😅
Ironically, EA just announced they'd be patching the invincibility glitch, I think
In the intro sequence, when he was counting cameras, my first instinct was “1, 2, 3, 4, how many troopers are in my store” and I honestly hate myself
11:10 can somebody tell me how the Ost is called? I'm trying to find out since 5 years 😐
Dying light 2 when
I hope that I can find a match on battlefront 2 after this video
Having a credit card sponsor in a Battlefront 2 is just that ironic eh?
1% spiderman  0% sex 0% drugs 100% *Salicious B. Crumb*
I didn't even know that monkey-lizard *has* a name
Badger got sponsored so I grabbed a Butter knife and got ready to fight
Dudes got the OG battlefront sound effects in the beginning.
Great vid Badge. More Payday 2 soon?
there's also a mod that allows custom characters to be played online where everyone can see them use the new custom abilities and stuff like that not just a skin an actual new hero reinforcement etc
"packing heat like alec baldwin"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn I got told that Badger has an SO by them making a joke about no one knowing Badger has an SO, that’s some funny shit
I just want to be featured and for you guys to have a laugh, so I was at LA at school and we had a assignment that was to say yes or no to the definition of COMMUNISM. I mean, one of the questions was "People should only live for a standard set of time" or another one was "Citizens who break the rules shouldn't be part of society anymore"
Soviet womble USA edition?
Intro too long
Guys I think he likes Selacious B Crumb
The force is strong with this Badger.
The sheer amount of Salacious B. Crumb in this vid is insane! I bet you’re gonna buy his action figure too.
The green gobbler
You probably don’t like getting asked to do a certain game for a video. But, there is a game called “Primal Carnage Extinction” that hasn’t been doing all so great with players. They have a VERY small community and I feel as if you played even on stream it could help the developers a lot.
I was banned off your discord for sharing files for a 3d printable AR15. can i get an un ban i have a glock lower to share.
Badger DO A TF2 VID Next OR FUCKING ELSE
that baldwin bit got me fucked up
Me:hold up wait a minute mods? Badger:SPIDER MAN
Hmmm they are not Sith troops they are coolaid jammers
Hitler was just trying to lower global unemployment
if my walls shook my mother would kick down the door and raid my room like the swat teams like gawd damn
You know with that "From Fortnite" joke I'm surprised they didn't say "The storm trooper from Fortnite"
Cheese for the algoritm
Yoooo this triple A commercial got infographic in ittt!! :0
I Love batllefront content
"The guy shooting back at you is packing heat like ALLEN BALDWIN" BRO NAW THATS A VIOLATION!
This chanel is proof that taking ketamine mixed with crack while having ADHD can turn into profitable business model in other words there is chance for me
Here's a comment and a like for the algorithm, love your Videos :)
لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله ☝🏽🔥
7:34 Heavenly's no gives me life.
I was here for this stream
us in the swbf2 community praise you for finally playing!
Amazing skills by Spider Man against All Crimes https://youtu.be/jtvO4trp9xM
Wait Badger is married?
1hp exploit is being fixed on February 7th
Bruh the bottom of the deathtrooper helmet looks like cloaker😂
the opening 20 seconds of any of his videos always has so much ENERGY behind it
But the real question is, did he buy his gamer supps with the current card?
Man these animations suck. I mean they don't suck, they're good and all, but for some reason the previous way was just funnier to me. Whatever.
If you hold right click on flametrooper you shoot a fire ball
This vid was 5% gameplay, 65% animation, and 30% Current ad. Expected more from such an outlandish title
Badger out here raising solacious crumb awareness
I love you
can i report a video for sending me to the hospital cuz i laughed so hard i passed out?
Hey badger i feel like you would have a good time playing titanfall 2 on the northstar client because it can be modded and its another game abandoned by EA
Are you going to play the new Warhammer game when it comes out
yeah, the outro definitely is worthy of badger
To be fair, the unemployment rate to zero by destroying a planet joke was done by *The Onion* first…
Check out the new Washington Commanders - Star Wars Crawl!! https://youtu.be/cpVTk3mlZI4
“The most well protected franchise”  As a legends fan, this *Severely Irks* me…
This is quality Bf2 right here
Only if I can find a match with the empire
How to solve issue with mods? Make a private server. Now you can mod without fear of banning
I want a mod that allows me to play as a Yuuzhan Vong, amphistaff and all ;)
For the algorithm
Not even a week after this goes up I hear that they're gonna do server maintenance since the game is still available for purchase (meaning whoevers still buying the game rn is buying a broken game)
really want to see you play crossout again you might really enjoy the "kaiju"
Perfect mashup ever
I wonder how badger will react when he finds out Jabba thought of eating selacias crumb, also there species get eaten in starwars
Really my favorite YouTuber
Hearing those menu sounds from swbf2 classic is so nostalgic.
Lel noob. Play on Xbox. It can’t get hacked.
Badger the 🐐 but wait until he find heroes vs villains
Okay, now play the original star wars battlefront 2
Its clones or nothin...clanka
Pretty sure genocide on a planet is called geocide.
Crumb is god
A group of storm troopers arguing over whether glassing a planet solves the unemployment problem seems pretty canon actually.
No offense badger but you have like  6 forehead lines
#11 on trending let’s go
You know what's funny? Master Chief would definitely fit perfectly in the StarWars universe. Hands down.
Bananakin Skywalker is B A S E D
I would love to play 1 game with these guys there funny as hell
Me: Oh no another debit card sponsor Also Me: HOLD UP, WHERE DO WE GET THAT TEE SHIRT THO?
*I'll try not to laugh... I will edit this if I do*
Will you please play team fortress 2 it would be funny
bruh Badger should do a video on fallout 76 multiplayer doing the dumbist shit ever bro
Hnnng wAiF?!
this video is a master craft
Dude the title should be The Empire Strikes Crack
Im still hoping for doom and doom eternal videos, and maybe a fallout 4 one
Anakin Skywalker? More like Bananakin Skinwalker.
dey put da mamstre cheiph in da star wors
I didn’t know badger liked Salacious Benjamin crumbulon but here we are
Lmao, I watched this live as I was playing BF5. I completely forgot they were playing Battle Front 2.
10:47 you just described tf2
good to see u back
Ah yes, Bananakin Skywalker.
Bananakin I love you
Badger you might want to check out Escape from Tarkov you might enjoy it I think it's fun just kinda difficult
i cant use current bc cambodia
Y’know, Badger would absolutely love The Republic Commandos if he knew their lore. Highest trained genetically advanced Clone soldiers who were literally trained by fucking MANDALORIANS. Equipped with hidden high frequency vibro-blades that cut through armor like it’s wet toilet paper, and a fully customizable DC-17m blaster that could change classes on the fucking fly. These guys could take mandalorians in a fist fight and make Jedi and Sith flinch
MMMM
Is that the jedi of 87?
I have never laughed so much in my life. And woken up my parents so fast. Two for one.
Mr badger please upload more I love ur videos. I honestly thought that ur vr ww2 vid and "the time is now, comrade"
They can just join private servers and mod the hell out of it
damn I wish all scout troopers could shoot like that
0:44 I love all the old fashion battlefront noises you used here. Brings back memories.
The ashen one blasting Rey into nonexistence was neuron activation for me.
Glassing Yavin-4 because they’re not economically feasible and lower unemployment, is the plot behind the Purge films.
1.2M visits in 1 day  *This is what peak performance looks like*
badger married A Pikachu?
I don't wanna say it, but I main the normal heavy trooper, and I can do doss on the hero's, but I utilize I frames, so that's why, probably
They put the mamster chefted in the star wars
How did no one say babanakin Skywalker
I've been thrown into this intro this like my non existent father Micheal Jordon'ing my 3 year old dumbass into the deep end of the pool in an attempt to distract the FBI from his recent tax fraud.
YES SALACIOUS B CRUMB GETS NOTICE
Admiral: Master Chief mind tell me what you’re doing in the Star Wars Universe? Master Chief: Sir, you can’t un-stunt the tauntaun.
Day 4 of telling badger to play minecraft
Badger I’m surprised you know who salacious crumb is
Rainbow 6 Extraction
considering there is a Halo ring in the newer episodes of Book of Boba Fett, Master Chief being in this feels appropriate.
God has let me live another day and I’m making it y’all’s problem
Russian badger is the only person who I won't skip during the sponsor because it's still funny
YOOOO NEW YEAR NEW OUTRO YOOOOOO
I need to see the Russian badger on the obiwan series
Wish he covers Tf2, that game is literally just a shit post the fps. Perfect for Badger.

Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!!
Just want to say thanks for all the great content! Keep it up!!!!
Salacious Crumb is the MVP of the Star Wars movies
Play tf2?
Gregory need you to turn of this bullshit
EA?  Fixing a game a couple years old?  They can't even fix a game a few months old.
13:06 The republic commando sounded a tiny bit like Chris Chan. No, just me?
i believe in salacious crumb supremacy
Yay
So, they fixed the exploit that puts everyone at one hp.  Seeing as your alone can prompt a company to fix a game....  Please play titanfall 2.  It has mods
He should play star wars squadrons
play gtfo for fok sake
7:06 "That doesn't make him wrong."  I mean, that don't make it right either.
i don't know how people watch this shit
Damn all my friends... who am I kidding I don't have friends
Badger did you participate In the Mr beast 50k battle royale
BADGER AND HIS CREW MAKE STAR WAR BETTER THEN DISNEY CAN EVER BE
smonk
Yall should play Tf2
Badger sayin this game is 4 years old and with multiple bugs... Mate you play R6S. It's a dinosaur game.
Hell Let Loose would be hilarious with them, but I do not know how well they would adjust to the games pacing.
Whoa! Jabba the Hutt owns slaves!?! My whole life is had been a lie!!!!
Fucking LOVE thee vids! Also, what ever shit you guys come up with, is NOTHING compared to the damage done by Disney!  If any thing your damage is impoving it!
Idk but I miss the old Russian badger when it was just him without those 3D animations. When he would just review the games or something like BFH days
Hey Badger, I doubt you'll see it. BUT EA ACTUALLY SAID THEY WERE FIXING IT. On monday, there will be server downtime to fix it
The Raimi Spidey suit is better in Battlefront II than in Marvels Spider-Man LMAO
Death trooper = cloacker, THEY WILL BOTH BEAT YOUR ASS
palpatine solving unemployment through aggressive empire recruitment was actually canonically one of the reasons he had actual avid supporters, troops and stormtroopers were actually thankful for a job that got tham off the street.
I still don't know how they managed to find a match, but it's great to see some Battle front 2
In defense of the destruction of Alderaan, the planet was acquired by a bunch of colonists slaughtering the native Killiks who retreated to a tunnel system. Said natives were going to make a push for the surface due to the influence of their god Abeloth. The destruction of the planet might not have been necessary if the locals had something of an army, but since house Organa forgot their roots of slaughtering other noble houses while looking pristine, the cost of hunting bugs through tunnels outweighed the risk of keeping Alderaan around, founding planet or not. Palpie's master planned the whole death star business to shoot down the servants of Abeloth who pack serious firepower. Unfortunately, due to the negligence of Alderaan's leadership there were more servants of a hostile power on Alderaan than anywhere else in the Empire. It had to go.
If I knew how, I would sure as hell download that master chief mod so I could set a running riot in 3rd person against an army of clankers.
I can just tell that the invincibility thingy is gon be fixed soon due to this video
Damn Master Chief molded into BF2 looks more fun than Halo Infinate although right now I would take herpes over Halo Infinate
Badger if I could, I would paid you $200- no, 400 dilla dollars for you and your friends to Shit on Destiny 2 to see what happens! No Cap.
My first name is anakin and hearing my favorite youtuber repeatedly say my childhood nickname, bananakin, is such a surreal feeling. It made my week.
Badger why you so good at making videos.. Give this man more subs
literally shit like this from Badger is why i got into content in the first place, if i can make shit even half this funny i will be happier than should ever be possible
DICE has (finally) announced a fix for the 1hp hack will be released on the 7th of February
Love ur videos badger. I got some of ur gamer sups delivered yesterday and it's fkkin delicious. Forgot to use ur code in the store, next time I get some ima use ur code.
Danke for mentioning the Death trooper
The og battlefront noises release so much seratonin man
A new battlefront video. Great!
Should someone tell him that they have private servers now where you can go insane with mods and the bugs like hackers are not an issue? XD
Flame Trooper? You mean FLAMMENWERFER
Bananakin Skywalker
DUDE WHY DIDNT YALL PLAY ON KYBER WHAT THE FUCK
If more people animated and joked their way through sponsored segments like you, maybe I wouldn't skip them as often. Cheers
I think badger might like solacios crumb
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON TITANFALL IF YOU CAN
Yo Bager! When are you gonna play tf2 with da boys?
Yooo you should totally play clownfield 2042, that shit is so funny and I think yall would have a lot of fun with it
Omg what I would give to see badger playing republic commando or project winter
Can y’all just do tf2 now
*They put da Master Chief in da soda*
Sees sponsor short: Laughs in European, literally everyone here has a debit card, thing isn't special.

Bro packing heat like alic Baldwin 😂
WAIT BADGER IS MARRIED????
you make every game look fun keep the good work
wait badger has a wife I thought he was gunna die like a true gamer
Bananakin Skywalker is incredible
so this game is the epitome of, 'its better with friends' but that goes for just about every game in existence.   The highlight of this video was definitely watching Rey get roasted by a flamethrower.
so fucking funny
I also had that hackers :(   That wasn't funny [*]
Why do you think he was coughing?
I wish he included links to where to download the mods, I'd love to see which ones he downloaded so I don't get my EA Account literally nuked
MORE BATTLEFRONT PLX BAJUR
The real question is how did he not get bugged games?
“ they put master chief in the soda “
I would like the 20 cents my view makes on this video to go to heavenly
Therapist: "Bananakin isn't real, he won't hurt u."  Bananakin: ***Gaucamole Gamer farts 9000 intensifies***
russianbadger has the best content
Describing Star Wars as “the most protected franchise” completely ignores the entirety of the extended universe… but I guess it’s called “legends now”
Crumb exists Russian badger  Is for me
Wait... BaDgEr Iz MaRrIed, My GaMeR!?
We’re the mods on customs servers only
Now this is epic
BTW, ea won't ban you, the don't realy give a shit about the game anymore, that's why the game has a abundance of hackers that are not banned
I fucking hate game studios that are strict on mods. Just do what Vermintide 2 does, and have a modded server and a regular server with approved mods that can work in the regular server. Or just do what Stellaris does and not give a damn; like EA gives a shit anyway they're busy making the next 100 FIFA games.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life887
I don't care what kind of day I'm having bad good this guy always know how to make me laugh great content bro
yo what do you use to edit? is it VR or 3d? maybe unreal..
This is vtuber yo the next level
Yo i didn't know that tom brady was a jet trooper
Goddamn thats the content i live for
You will never ever make me buy another EA game
This man has got to play dying light 2
lets freakin go another badger video
I already see this video ending with me photoshopping a banana onto Bryce from AWSW
2:27  Grunts when you kill their Elite.
George lucas already choked on his tongue when he saw what disney did
5:59 is still better than the rise of skywalker.
Try borderlands
Bro you should play for honor
I feel Russian Badger and the gang would love the insanitary that is taking place in Titanfall 2 in the Northstar client.
God i miss that right click on the sith trooper.  I just might play again lol
I would say he's quantity over quality But I don't know what quantity means So he's nothing but good quality
Yo someone who can translate the text scrolling on the bottom at 0:36. Im actually curious if it means something
May I recommend Titanfall 2 when it also comes to community’s saving the game
hold up, it's a new lvl of shitposting? daaaamn son 👍
HOLY SHIT HOLY FUCK STR WERZ
No one cares but when I was like 12/13 I made a battlefield 4 video on an IPad and you commented on it 😂 you had about 200k/300k subs at the time, just something I always remember, now look at you 👏🏼
12 on trending!
Yo badger if you want to find a game with amazing movement and some good fuck around and find out content might I suggest another unbalanced game ea abandoned Titan fall 2, just download the game and the NorthStar client so you can bypass the DDOS and 2,458 ping attacks, could be fun but it’s just a suggestion
Glassing a planet to say "unemployment is at zero", seems a lot like Extermunatus-ing a planet to then say the demonic infestation is also at zero.
Who would win. Bananakin. Darth Vader. Three hundred ewoks. Jabas whole army. Or Shrek.
I just took a bet where I to had drink a whole cup of queso for 5 dollars. That shit was cold and I'm lactose sensitive. I don't know how my body is doing so well.
I swear, the sound effects that he added in from the menus of the original Star Wars Battlefront II for the PS2 just... they hit different man. Some surreal neuron activation hittin' like a blast from the past.
Idk why but the end of this vid kinda got me emotional man. I like it here, happy to be a YouTube frog.
FINALLY, somebody else who appreciates salacious b crumb as much as me. Long live King Crumb.
5:40  i can not explain how mad i am rn... you did not respect the 1v1-
Love star wars content
One of the first videos I watched the entirety of the streams
Hell yea! Love digi being in the Vid!
Damn bro the moment the Baldwin jokes showed up I knew this was demonetized af lmao keep it up
I can't Tell if it's Cursed or Badass to see Master Chief, a Spartan, is in the Star Wars Universe and Killing Clones
I love when you and the boys start doing nefarious shit to games lol
*proceeds to link this video to George Lucas so he can actually choke on his tongue* star wars is dead and the mouse fucking killed it.
Eliminate crime on alderon by eliminating alderon
"Star wars is the most protected franchises on the planet"  *looks at the last three movies*
with that unemployment bit they created a paradox. blowing up a planet brings unemployment to zero, but that also means employment goes down bc now one has a job.
Babe, wake up, new russian badger vid just dropped
Your married
Let's go new badger vid
badgur has a waif what
You know, Badger looks like postal dude when he is looking down. I mean like no joke, it's literally postal dude in Real Life without drugs and cool sunglasses.
Another video, another banger
So YouTube demonitizes Badgers last BattleFront video because of jokes that “gone too far”. But he somehow gets trending. I think Badger has YouTube by the balls at this point.
Another great video my friend 10/10 keep it up i love every upload
Am I the only one that didn't know Badger is fucking married?
Ayo didn’t doom guy blast Mars Idk what was living on there but it definitely solved unemployment
Literally just a living shitpost. Every video. And it couldn't be a better way for me to relax after a long day. I feel like my brain is just off now. No stress in this moment. Bliss.
Bananakin Skywalker lol
Badger is the best YouTuber and no one can convince me
The day badger gets a ps5 is the day I die
Republic Commando when?
why the fuck is grouse a furry
Yo my favorite Jedi spider man
Talking about TF2  Badger could get the Game back up by playing it. As the game is still on. Probably the oldest Online game thats alive.
XD
I can’t wait for Ewoks to all become Salacious Crumb clones
The arc trooper is my favorite, you can shoot to the other side of geonosis and it seeks the enemy, it's broken
Better than the actual lore though.
The First Order is maybe based, but they still can't shoot for shit.
Prenti
So I was curious why I wasn’t get any updates on your videos, turns out I got unsubscribed. So the bug is real.
these videos are a fuckin fever dream man and i love it
Hearing Heavenly mention TF2 was not something I knew I needed. Also, this game is headed down the same path as TF2.
only a few people will know what game that model your using to represent yourself is from, and I find that kinda funny, that is all.
Mando punting baby yoda was the best and that content is unreal love the mods more starwars and Salious B Krumb
Ok, shut up about your sponsorship. I don't care whatever happens to your ways of getting money because you waste my time to all this crap and you don't let me watch the video.
8:46 has the same energy for me as, "He's got a sword!" "You idiots, we've all got swords!"
Badger I love your vids and I would join the discord if I could remember my fucking password
If YouTube can't take fictional slave jokes, executing ewoks, punting baby yoda into outerspace and planet wide genocide to lower unemployment jokes, then I don't want to be hear anymore
Where’s rainbow six content badger
> perfectly maintained > looks at last few movies > yeah i don't know about that one chief
One mil views in a day? Hot damn badger, your some shot shit (please don't yell at me I mean it in the nicest way possible)
Been watching since circa 2016, I don't think my life would have been the same if i had never discovered this man and the absolute goldmine that is this youtube channel. ^~^
15:36 this motherfucker got beans!
the real question is, is it worth to play now
I vow to watch every badger video until I recognize every clip at the end of the year video
Came here for badger stayed for grouse👑
one of the few times I watch a sponsored segment, praise crumb
20 seconds of modded gameplay. Mostly regular and Badger flossing in mocap skin suits.
Is it just me or is this video in particular just not hitting?
Badger's married?! That poor lady.  She didn't expect to also to marry his chat
way to much explaining and not enough gameplay shenanigans with the boys
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
will he do more, or do tf2?
Videos that I feel were a good use of my time to watch: whatever the hell this was
I am surprised that badger hasn’t made a video on far cry 6 and the fucking alligator named Guapo
Far cry 6 vid when?
Badger back at it again with the high budget, high effort S**t post.
Speaking of tf2….. vid when!?!?
Imagine if there was a group of troopers in the movies that are voiced by the guys and just somehow don’t die.
Tried your gamersupps pretty good
Also make a fallout 3 vid cause it’s really popular right now an the analytics on it is really good to get subscribers
I remember when this guy used dead bodies as props . The good ol' days
Wait Badger's MARRIED?? Well shit
Badger your the reason why I play. R6thanks bruv
Can I play as Elan Sleazebaggano?
Like the cringe from Fortnite
I can't wait for his 2042 video where he talks about the M5A3 with dual optic, speedy 7.62 NATO but by SiG rounds, underbarrel grenade launcher from the Poles and a wrapped suppressor
YEEEEEES FINALLY SOME MORE BII
The First Order is the coolest to play in game and the worst to watch in movie.
Mark 8:36- “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Anyone that does not make sure they have taken care of their soul will end up destroyed. Your soul is the part of you that is eternal. It is tragic when a person dies and is not sure of where they will spend eternity.
they put the mamsnrhbr chehfde in the soder is all i heard when i saw masterchief btw you should upload rainbow 6 and pay day 2 again
This bot problem is starting to get out of hand
Try galactic assault battle of geonosis. I promise you will love the AT-TEs
You just played the best game of all time
I can't believe Grouse just committed grand theft tauntaun
HNNNG WAIF 15:53
This guy is the definition of funny
I wanna see badger play modded Terraria and realise how mind-numbingly dense that game can be.
Sorry guys, current is not worth it. I never got my card and they still charged me
Gotta love how Badger's sense of humor has descended into absolute madness over time.
1:17 bro that's like me trying to get a tauntaun in the og battlefront 2
who does the animations
“The class shooting back at you is packing heat like Alec Baldwin.”  Yup, definitely going to hell for laughing at that
I love how baby yoda is holding a M1911
he do his lil dancy dance
does current work in Australia?
Who finally your back
This vid made me laugh so hard. I had a rough day today but I sat down to watch this it made me happy and my day a little better
Finally a new video
Bananakin
Russian Badger out here changing the cannon, can’t wait to see the Russian Badger Cannon.
WHAT DID I DO?????
I love bombing planets
Perfectly maintained, huh? Then what the fuck is the rise of skywalker then?
i love the sith trooper so much because they're literally the incarnation of black air force energy
Im with heavenly, when’s that  movie coming out
A compilation of "FUCK YOU, SPIDERMAN!" would be kinda funny as a vid. Not sure how many times it happened, but I'd imagine it was at least 10 mintues, 30 max.
Lmao bananakin
I'm feeling the spaghetti now Mr krabs
https://youtu.be/lXS7chyX9eM 🔥🔥🐐🐐
Badger play Fnaf with your friends commentary over your screen share
9:43 It took hearing this about 5 times to not hear the N word
Your GMod animations are amazing.
HNNNG WAIF!?
I would not call the lire "maintained" when you just dumpster everything and make your own. Straight up lore gentrification
ITS CURRENT, SEE!
Now do Titanfall 2 + Northstar
the CURRENT state of this game is broken
I wish Badgers friends were my friends. Then i would finally have friends
There's some gaming in your mocap video
Spider man with a lightsaber oh my God
I question, why salacious B crumb
Matthew 25:45-46 King James Version 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
another hit video keep it up
This video violates the Geneva Convention….
I didn't even know this man was married congrats on that
i like it when mr crumb laughs
10:29 hit me in my funnies
I'm glad Badger is still giving us next level outtro songs, really makes my day
Hey,i think you could say it is CURRENTly the best card in the game
So basically Badger’s way to describe the entire Star Wars franchise is all about Light sabers, guns and mods, that’s it
Like Master Chief from Fortnite?
Day 2 of asking badger to play tf2
Your videos cure depression, keep up the good work 👍.
bananakin skywalker
Bananakin
My god the C word jokes are so funny distinctly because they just come out of nowhere it's hilarious.
#10 on trending? Let’s go Badger, congrats!
8:55 well played. I also want to see the movie they were making.
the incredulousness in Heavenly's voice when he says "what do you have? a fake gun???" killed me  God bless this ragtag buncha chaotic neutrals, y'all keep doin you.
I feel like badger has the power to take on ninja
*Sees Badger uploaded a new vid, looks at pistol* Not today old friend, not today
I love that ZF digi is here. Go Digi
YOOOOOOOOOOOO
No way you have a wife
1 M in a Day? Damn
cant count them as unemployed if theyve been atomised
Yeah EA abandoned the game to focus on other projects and not because initial reactions were so poor Disney took the fucking license away from them and now after patching the FTP shit out they're going to pretend it didn't exist to see if they can go shoe horn NFTs into the next Battlefield.
Badger looks like an old template meme at the start of the video and than a mew one at the end
Im pretty sure George Lucas finds your modded BF2 for StarWars lore more accurate than whatever the hell Disney made with Rey and edge lord simp Kylo
I am starting to see a theme 4 mins into the video verasiccrumb
Yo badger u ever doin a tf2 video?
"Your to late Spiderman weed has been legalized."
1k to 1mil in 28 days 😉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwADBQKQ3pq6_GM7cfm3ZZg
My volume was way to loud and the intro actually blasted my eardrums
What are we doing today Badger: modding 🤣
1 mil views in one day. What a legend.
The pov camera change sound is the selection screen in the old battlefront game!!!
"hol up... * Whale sounds* "
if Badger can play a game that broken and still have fun with his friends, plz try dead by daylight, that game is terrible without friends
Heyy!! Badger, It’s me PudgeGamer20! Your Welcome Man! Also, You’re such a Awesome Guy!
You know, I did not have a good time playing ewok hunt, 2 ewok against 14 stormtroopers all in one building
I’m still mad they didn’t update the old jet troopers to fly like the first order jet trooper
Yes he did watch it
where is gasoline? is he safe? is he alright?
I wanna show badger so much shit he can use for a vr video
EVEN THE FUCKING ADS ARE FUNNY
SOMEONE TRANSLATE THE MANDO'A!
i wont sit here and act like badge is a star wars fan when he thought EA came up with clankers
Badger: Posts a new video Me: Serotonin  o v e r l o a d
Does bajur realize his current card color scheme is the damb Bi flag?
Fun fact: if you eat a gram of uranium, you will die from kidney failure before you die of radiation poisoning
Aw man, I said I'd be Canon fodder for you guys but you never replied.  Well at least the video is fun
Hey badger can you please start making siege vids again
Turning someone into a hot pocket is something I need to start saying in video games
Day two of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
I legit just saw this go from 5 on trending to 6
Wait will there be a fnaf security breach video? Pls let that be true also bananakin skywalker has risen from the food aisle of corucsant.(unsure if I spelled it correctly)   Me seeing this video: "star wars multi epilogue: THE MODDED MEMES ATTACK BACK-ETH!!!" Lmao!
Like green goblin from fortnight
I’ve been watching Badger since he made Battlefield 4 content and I still don’t know if he’s genuinely teasing his next video when he does his end of video bit
whats up badger?
BAGUR UPLOAD YESSSSSSSSSSS
“Fuck you Spiderman!” Didn’t know Jameson played Battlefront.
"Packing heat like Alec Baldwin."
2:23 love hearing the original battlefront sounds
Rey being torched to death sounds like a better ending then the actual ending

If badger was the emperor we’d definitely have a Hot pocket day 🤔
honestly, im actually really glad badger's views are still doing good despite the fact that i never watch him anymore, and if im gonna be honest, ive only stopped watching him because ive grown up and moved on. glad youre still doing good dude.
Still got ads on the video so Russian badger won
The Knuckles Apparition-https://youtu.be/gXqjJ8tKvVg
Best  YouTuber in the world I look forward to your videos every month
Now I want to see what Badger and everyone can do on Titanfall. The Northstar client is up on pc meaning fully working community servers with lots of modifiers. Just don't look at the r/titanfall without Schizophrenia meds and an iron will :)
Damn even IRL vegeta has a bulma.
Fox, news channel news
I actually had an incredibly bad experience with Current and I’m trying to close out my account. I got money fraudulently taken out of my account and they can’t do anything about it and haven’t refunded my money yet
Wait badger has a wife?! I thought he just had a girlfriend we only ever heard from like..once, ever
All 9 Wario Apparition Games in 1 Playlist-https://youtu.be/KPHY3UV5oc0
if you’re used to hopping in and out of servers to find a playable game, sounds like it’s time for a tf2 video
We need a Star Wars movie with Russianbadger and his friends in it and they just actively do random shit like this
I'm still amazed how a storm trooper is more accurate with a flame thrower than they are with a rifle.
Halo infinite video when?
They put the Mamser Sheep in der Star Wers  Jokes aside, seeing you run around as Chief almost makes me want a 3rd person Halo game.
Toby Maguire's Spidey with a Lightsaber?   Damn we got robbed in "No Way Home" lol.
Who completed level 15? What's the word? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU5b6pZs_5o

Today is good day. First I get dying light 2 and then a new badger upload :)
My jaw hurts from laughing
Guy from Fortnite
Theres like 0 gameplay. Stop w the heavy animation
Battlefront is the best game out
12:06 You wanna try out a right click ability that hits way harder than that? play with Iden Versio, and if they keep on hogging the heroes to themselves, you can play on coop just to try 'em out at least
So heavily is the doom slayer, a cacodemon, and now glam rock Freddy          What world do we live in
I gotta say badger, youre leaning a little too heavily away from gameplay in this one and too much into mocap lol
I've started playing so many old shooters again just because badger makes a video on them and its such a fun time
I can always trust badger content to scratch that 2007 Xbox live itch.
WATCH IT BEFORE ITS AGE RESTRICTED KIDDOS!
Oh man the agony to know we have to wait that much time for another quality video🤦 @TheRussianBadger please don't let us wait for so long. Your videos are my escape from adulting!!! On a more serious note, great stuff my man, keep it up and much success 💪
Dead game lol
Modded New Vegas incoming
#5 on trending!!
I gotta watch Russian badger episodes like a Netflix show because of them monthly releases
Me) thincking if there is a god   (After waching therushonbager)  Also me: THERE IS NO GOD
Love your videos!! Everyone be safe out there ❤️
TF2 video when?
6 years later ive come to watch a russianbadger video and what on earth am i watching, what has happened
I mean;  I'm surprised you aren't demonetized more often with some of the shit you and the squad say and get up to most the times, if I'm honest. Its quite impressive.
The SFX from switching camera positions in your intro of what camera too looks at, it’s gotta be the sound when toggling through the menu or selecting a character from the original ps2/og Xbox battle front 2
This guy is literally the definition of quality over quantity.
i enjoyed this ad
Badger bb-8 is op bro
Why is nobody talking about all the ATF jokes
Bruh I start going ham with the heavy class 😌👌
haha good stuff! Nicely done!
Take a shot every time he says Salacious Crumb
I loved the Outro.
the lady baldwin shot died have some class
I want badger to try Destiny 2 and watch his dumb ass unlock the feature, of INFINITE SLAM. For any D2 players out there, it is literally Skullfort and middle tree thunder crash.
I cannot begin to imagine how much work these videos take to make.
can you do a tf2 video of theese

this is the only guy that would make it possible for KIRBY to DESTROY MAULS CHEEKS
Sadly the game isn't getting any more updates

I’m pretty sure if someone ruining Star Wars could kill George Lucas, he would’ve already died watching The Last Jedi
A
your editor must be rich lol
Wait so badger’s married???
This is #6 on trending. Like not just gaming but all YouTube... good job Forehead
joking about the Alec baldwin thing was scummy.
Dam I just got lost and watched 4 of your vids then called for help in that time it was peek I want to get lost more
thank you badge.
Guys I think Badger just enjoys Selacious B Crumb just a little bit TOO much.
Master Chief kills SpiderMan?
Capital murder. What's in your prop gun
Selatious b crumb sounds like he’d wear a monocle and top hat as he’s duking it with you to have relations with your woman
Ask The Gods.
HOL UP YOUR MARRIED?
3/10 sponsor, doesn't do anything for people outside the US. 17/10 video
bananakin potassium
100 000 likes, perfect
He is still following me! https://youtube.com/shorts/NClZFdy0V38?feature=share
badger was a salesperson in his previeous life you cant convince me otherwise
Somehow Russian badger has returned
Of course he worked in finance
Bananakin skywalker
badger's content is heavy weapons because GOD DAMN THEY HIT HARD
I have no idea why this video would get demonitized, and yet, I feel like it did.
Like a true Skywalker, Rey gets burned alive.
I always love these even if they take 5 months to make ,keep up the work badger
Youtube: YoU CanT MakE SlAVe JoKeS On YoUtUbe!  Badger: OBSERVE
Youtube hates this man.
I've been waiting for more badger battlefront content
wait hes married
The best content on youtube nocap
Leia and the arc trooper has second fires too and you can use kyber for new heroes online like mando and jango fett
2:02 pov: you didn't fix the damn door
“Welcome back to another great addition of me and my buddies ruining the Star Wars franchise”  Bruh, if anything, Badger’s turning up Star Wars content greater than Disney ever could(save the Mandalorian), just more…comical. Star Wars with slapstick and bass boosted shitposters…what’s not to love?
Dey put da master chief on the battlefront
Hey are you a good person? If you have ever lied,stolen,or taken God's name in vain or broken any of his commandments you are guilty you deserve punishment just like in a court of law if you commit a crime you get justice served to you. God is perfect judge and carries out perfect justice do you know what God did for guilty sinners he went to the cross paying their fine just before he died he said IT IS FINISHED. the debt of mankind has been paid for by his blood he suffered the death penalty on the cross to keep you out of hell. just like in a court of law you can pay someone's fine that's what Jesus did please repent and trust in the saviour today you will be saved this life is a mearly 80 to 90 years but eternity is forever please choose life today come to Jesus he's calling you by name
Badger, homie, take a break from the gamersupps and GET A FUVKIN NAP YO
Dey put the mamstr cheef in th stur wers.
the intro is such a flex of editing ability
J.K. Simmons be like: 13:42
The casual outfit becomes more casual with every video
Always a treat Badger
Badger should make an onlyfans
Claim before 1m views aka Seizure here
UR MARRIED?
Don't try it bananakin, I have the high ground.
That intro was the definition of adhd
Badger: "If George Lucas saw this, he'd probably choke on his own tongue."  Me: "Nah still better than the sequels"
Where is the rainbow six siege content
https://youtu.be/yC6C_xi7gvY
10:57 Open that shet up right now. I KNOW you can hear me. I'm not leavin. *Opens door* HE'S THERE, HE'S THERE, TORCH HIS ESS FELLAS'
Absolute Goat
I can confirm about the death trooper played a little battlefront to the other day talking to a friend there goes an entire army of rebels
Lmfao I love that you modded master Chief into the game lol
New badger video, new brain cell
Aight badqer
Fucking pin me, catgirls can't be real
did they fix the game?
Heavenly as Freddy is CASH
YouTube recommended me this video yesterday. I had never seen your vids before. Clearly, the algorithm is learning what I like...
1:58 not to be rude but that was the weakest lightsaber twirl I have ever seen
Jesus #11 on trending well done!
Bananakin skywalker
Who wants to see Badger do some walkthroughs like he did with fallout, but with a much more mellow art like animal crossing or fall guys for a change 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I had this playing on my Alexa and my parents think I’ve lost all will to live
How does he do the animations?
Yeah sure, I'm going to buy a Battlefront III skin NFT when they'll just drop the ball within 3 years and I can just mod Bananakin Skywalker in the game my damn self. Same people who said we can't have a pink Vader is finna drop randomized clown vomit skins and call them one of a kind.
I DICE allowed for mod support on every platform this game would have more players than 2042 if it doesn't already... screw it I'm re-installing it
didnt EA fixed the 1hp glitch?
I want to see Otis from barnyard force choke somebody.
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
Bananakin bananawalker and the bananasaber
Flamethrowmer
I love when you have sponser cause you make it so HILLARIOUS
MFW you solve unemployment by glassing an entire fucking planet
"Welcome back" Its good to be back
YES YES YES PERFECT VIDEO
I have to say that if you know how to cheese a class even the base classes feel like elite troops
If right click while in the air with the jet trooper in the first order you float
Legit in science class rn don’t tell me they video grind don’t stop
It kinda sucks that some of the coolest things a deathtrooper have done on screen is in this badger video.   Disney just doesn’t let the bad guys live
At this point Badger has to be on an FBI watchlist😂
Thats wild. Need to play this.
A new badger video is an injection of pure joy straight to the brain.
He used the cloaker sound for the death trooper and I got scared.
If George Lucas watched this he'd chuckle and shake your hand bruh wym
Badger bought a 30k motion tracking suit and is now worried about going bankrupt...Seems legit
Why is it that I’ve laughed and had a much better time watching this then all the sequels?
Okay, but can we talk about how Th Empire, that has all of its regiments predominantly consisting of children POWs, decided to create a ridiculous and expensive weapon that ensures there are literally no survivors by decimating the ground they stand on. Sounds kind of counter intuitive, are they just hoping that children from other planets just torture and recruit themselves after seeing an entire planet get blown up along with all its resources, tradesmen, history, scientific achievements, and just sheer lost body count for the universal economy the Empire is attempting to control. If they want me dead that bad I'm finna just do it myself.
The classic battlefront 2 sounds
Badger raising the bar every episode, god damn!
ANOTHER BF2 VID YEEEESSSS
Badger posting on my birthday? I am complete
Badger please play Team Fortress with the squad. I beg.
Ah yes, I saw some of these moments on stream. And, ah yes, another Battlefront video.
perfectly maintained star wars universe  sequels: exists
Current is literally how it works in the EU, but worse
Holy shit, i didnt think he would make a video on Star Wars Battlefront 2.
no video has made me laugh more than this
Oh my god.. I want to see them play Hell Let Loose
Well, this is the first day I have ever seen your actual face in all the years I've known of and watched you. I was not prepared.
10/8  lost my braincells
I saw the stream on this
This is a masterpiece. Thank you.
did anyone else what badger dance at the end of the video until what to watch next popped up
BanAnakin Skywalker is destined to bring balance to your potassium levels.
Holy shit, I'm going to hell for this but at least I'll do it laughing
'The balance is horrible because if you're a Death Trooper-'  You are a DEATH TROOPER it BETTER be fucking imbalanced.
This is just 16 minutes of straight fun
Wake up babe new Badger video dropped
BEING BACK MORE SEIGE
16:22 man really just did the bebop "I'm going to sleep" voice.
Are you ever going to make a rainbow six siege video again looking back on them they’re the best videos
The funniest crap ever
you could totally be a door to door salesman the way you swear to the mother of god that whatever the fuck you sell actually makes life easier ...  thats not lying, thats art right there
Badger's about to singlehandedly make EA start making Battlefront 3 again
i swear, badger at the end made me fear early on set dementia
Comedy makes life good
Just a idea but.... Badger gang plays tiny Tina's assault on Dragon keep?
Try the ARC trooper, their shock Grenada plus their charger shots are pure deadly. Truly the GOAT of degenerate classes. Give yourself three evades and watch them chase you down like rabbit
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that it’s been a whole year since the last siege video
A video per year but the video can last a year
Wait I didn’t know u quit ur finance job
Badger are you actually in an engaged relationship?
I've literally played this game since it came out and I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD TACKLE AS A JET TROOPER
Badgers videos are literally the only ones where I watch the sponsor ads am I a monster 😳
I really needed this video today. Thank you
8:55 jokes are pretty funny but the will to hold my laughter got shot by alec
Can someone add a mod of badjur to this game
Love that you set up your cams and then ask why the cams are set up?
It's amazing with all the millions companies have and yet they can't compare to our boi badger with a mocap suit and a shitposting crusade
The reason why the death trooper is so good is because it's a reinforcement. It is meant to be a lot better than the standard classes. And EA is finally fixing the hacker problem this month, so can't wait to join up in BFII again and slaughter some innocents :) . Amazing video btw!
The one frame gun shot had me laughin more than anythang
OHH FUCK YEAH BUDDY
tfw sw:bf2 goes on sale
EA abandoned BFII, to focus all their effort on Battlefield 2042....that was not their best move. but with the immortality bug being an issue since October the fix for it is finally "on the radar" yea yea in other words "pfft we'll still sell this broken game"
Can we get a mocap suit behind-the-scenes? Imagine seeing badger just dancing and goofing about in an empty room with a mocap suit. No context, no music, just mocap.
Badger is the definition of the wild wasteland perk
HES BACK
B O A T
wait badger has a wife how did I njot know this
in the ad read badger look high as fuck, i respect that energy.
new video. YAY
Honestly, I WISH my friend group was this chaotic I also wish my friend group was more permanent than right now, but whatever
You pretty much mentioned why these games are so fun, it's your friend group that makes them so fun. you guys are awesome, much love.
5 on general trending? This guy is a god.
Best vid he made this year (for now🤣)
I love how you're using Glamrock Freddy for those
why the current card had that black censor looking line shi in the front? xD
the death troops is LIGIT the best class 100/5
I'm coming back to this video, just have to shoot at the Army's National air rifle competition really quick. Then it's to the whatever the heck this is.
That was a fucking lie on being tired dwag. Man went to stream Halo Infinite at midnight
Ngl. I would love to see what carnage Badger and boys would do on Kyber. The possibilities are on endless with custom servers.😄
Play the New Vegas dlc man. Theres so much shitpost potential there
why do i hear oh yeah every three minutes
If you thought these were crazy, you gotta check out the Kyber private servers so you can play gameplay mods together. New heroes and reinforcements to play as, new abilities to use, it's insane. And to alleviate concern, there's no ban risk because it doesn't run on EA's servers and everyone has to run the same exact gameplay mods (and in the same order) as the person hosting in order to join, so there's no worry over someone using a mod to give themselves exclusively an unfair advantage.
That motion capture suit is the best thing that badger bought 100%
Yeah, that exchange about Alec Baldwin was in very poor taste…
Badger you need to check out Titanfall 2. Similar to battlefront 2, EA has abandoned it and it’s a shit show, but the community made their own server browsing system and is modding the game to hell and back with the Northstar Client. You and the boys would have tons of fun, especially playing Big Papa Scorch.
I was really expecting you to call him bananakin skywalker lol
first ever animated mouth and it fucking freddy
2atching before age restriction
you aren't dying alone like the rest of us? kinda cringe
We now know what badger does with sponsorship money
Put a mod on BB-8 or BB-9 with the salacious crumb skin
Halo infinite?
Wait BADGER HAS WIFE?!
You should honestly do a video on Jedi academy: movie battles 2
You should play on kyber servers
oh no i can destroy those death troopers from a range or when i flanked them
I would love to see you do a team fortress 2 video :D
8:30 "i don't see this changing any time soon"  the devs literally 1 day later: "but what if?"
Badger we need Tf2 VIDEO
5:40 was there on twitch saw that crap live. Funniest thing ive ever seen
Now I want a Star Wars comedy with RussianBadger and his bros in it.
These animations are getting so CRISP, George Lucas might hire him for some good animations that are just disgustingly hilarious
5:55 It's not only what can be imagined, it's what should have happened to Rey. The Kennedy sequals would have been much better then
The use of the original sounds from both Star Wars battlefront and battlefront 2 on ps2 was like unlocking a secret memory for me.
Bradger's mrarried?  I guess everything is possible.
I really want to see what Badger could do in a game like Mordhau.
this is fucking beautiful
This man literally got me out of depression. Bruh . I cant get enough of his videos
Badger, love your videos, always gives me a much needed laugh...  The Alec Baldwin stuff though? That's....maybe a step too far. Really knocked me off the high from the rest of the video.
Ngl the fact he has to do all of the movement with his capture suit for nearly everything his friends say is pretty damn nutty of a commitment.
3:18 Respect from TF2 community for that towering pile of piles of hats and unusual effects here. Hope at some point VALVe will UN-bot the TF2 and you will get a chance to make a video on it. If you want to. Probably. Hopefully. ... Please.
Why do my nostrils keep airing out when I watch one of your videos
Someone please read the aurabesh
Mods make it more special to the game, but EA will ban your ass on sight
1:27 I’m dying send help!!😂
You know for a guy who brags that all his videos are shit-posts there is a suspicious amount of quality and effort put into them
Twenty seconds in and I wish this was never a thing
"You cant glass a fuckin planet and say you did it to solve the unemployment problem"  *sips my stellaris tea* I have done worse for less
i love you badger
Badger have you every play TF2.
Yo badger just some fun facts. Death trooper quite literally says “DEATH CHARGING” when you use the long range boomsticck. Another fun fact is that you can get hella height with the jet trooper and can waste rockets on everyone with upgrades so that you quite literally look like a fuxking AC130, boba fett just does this a million times better. Another fun fact the rebels in the “new empire era” have a heavy that walks around with a FUCKING CANNON that sounds like laser artillery blowing a small bunker of younglings up
Console is better
I was promised world of tanks
Never in my life thought i’d hear the words “Kirby clapped maul cheeks”
Cool video now give me your cool jäger looking model thing or I am going to blow up an orphanage
I’m laughing harder every time freddy shows up
Damn this is some good shit
Please play apex legends or rainbow six siege
Sir, you are the absolute best. There is little to no besting you. But for the love of god, PLEASE CLEAN OUT YOUR DISCORD MY MAN
How are you creating content on a game that's plagued by the 1hp bug?!
try hell diver, you wont disappointed
Bananakin something straight outta vegetales
someone posted this the r/prequel memes and I’m not disappointed at all
I love how Badger used sound effects from the classic Battlefront games
Why does this video feel nostalgic
Bananakin
Badger has found the golden area on how to make sponsor ads interesting.  Somehow.
Wait.... BADGER'S married??????
This video is perfect. I see no flaws
i am disappointed this isnt a 7 hour long video about Salacious B. Crumb
Space Vietnam is back!
1) Imagine fighting a squad of Flametroopers with comms broken and zero fear of death. Terrifying. 2) WAIT BADGER'S MARRIED?!
The 3d animation looked really good today
Please play infamous badger, its an amazing game for its time
Isn't the hero class supposed to be broken tho? They can still get killed, but they do be slaying.
I miss times when your videos were 80% gameplay and 20% funny fmv, and not the other way around.
Badgers fuckin married?
Everytime badger hypes up his friends I start thinking he's about to say he's dieing       When are we getting meal team 6 jerseys and merch
Badger content just brings joy to my life. I dont even know exactly how or why, but it does lol
why does he mocap these like he needs a piss
Hello Mario
He returns
You can’t ruin Star Wars more than Disney has
dey put da mamstre ciehf in da srta wras
My favorite creator is marki nah Russian badger
I cant wait for badgers next video when the koolade jammer trooper walks through a wall shouting HEYYYYYYYYY
Watching the ashen one fuck up ray in one hit is so satisfying
I just barely started watching you in the middle of last year, and I know for sure that it is one of the best choices I've made so far. You've made me laugh so much at home and in public, thanks for what you do. I wish you nothing but the best!
8:40-8:47 you wrong for this one badger 🤣
I’m not sure how, but y’all need to find a way to play some Battlefield 2 mods
Hearing my name Alec is cursed.  Just hearing prank em alec makes me die
I didn't know he was married
Battlefront II be balling but at what cost?
I really wished this game would have gotten more support.
we need a badger video on titanfall 2 ong
i like how y’all said this the farthest thing from star wars and it a hundred percent aligned with a lot of the plot of stars from unemployment to glassing yavin 4
Badger is the trooper that punches baby yoda in The Mandalorian confirmed.
Tried to translate the Mando’a (mandolorian language) from the please wait screen 37 seconds in and its gibberish. Was so hoping I’d found something cool lol
Mister Boojir can you play terraria with the boys pls?
Tbh this is just 16 minutes of shitpost. unlike L4D2 where you get fragments of the story, this is it just shitpost
Oh shit more badger fuck yeah
2:28 The fear in that man's voice when seeing Master Chief is downright primal
“Kirby is kicking mals ass”  *tbh kirby can kick anybody’s ass with the power of…*    *S U C C*
Let's be clear on something: The game as been unbalanced since day one and it's as bad as in Paladins.
Bro really took a month for 16 minute video
8:18 whomst in that poster tho
I'm sure Salacious B. Crumb would be flattered by your devotion to him.
Ngl those current cards look kinda fresh tho
Banana anikan
Wait, Badger has a wife?!
You can't ruin the star wars franchise any more than what Disney did already
this made my morning
8/10 this'll be demonitized
Bro I had no idea you even put a video out. Oh shit he's married
Badger has a Wife?
Another YouTube who doesn't mention that current is USA ONLY
man i though of a joke for CURRENT but na its too boring
Badger use to work in finance:  Guess he couldn’t Crunch The Numbers…              sry…..
Fun Fact the Sith troopers Right click shot is Actually the Noise Han Solo's gun (The DL-44) makes only I think with more Bass.
Babe wake up. New Russianbadger video :)
"This game is 4 years old, its got all these problems and is completely abandoned by the developer..." *looks at Titanfall 2* hmmmmmmmm  Side note: yes i know Titanfall 2 has a modded client now that fixed DDOS to some extent and that the game is almost 6 years old instead of 4 but the similarities can't be more coincidental  Also Badger you should try Titanfall 2 i am 100% convinced you and your buddies will have a blast playing it
god i wish i had friends like badger....or friends in general
I think badger is losing ideas fully based on the title
I love the truly next level disrespect of staying behind and DYING just so you can roast a single dude alive. Fucking beautiful.
yall would have been perfect for the troopers that beat baby yoda in mando
8:44 commence dying of laughter
Once again there are bots all over the servers in larger game modes. You’re great at this game but compare your player kills to your bot kills
finally star wars
How about Ronald McDonald as a Jedi in a pickle suit?
You say how great this game is, but I wonder if you play this game if none of your friends is with you to make fun of the game.  My guess? You don't.
'chief you might tellin me what you're Doing in star wars.    SIR finishing this ewok.
List of games I want to see Badger shitpost in: Sea of Thieves, Terraria, Rust, Shotgun Farmers, Fucking UNO
What in fucking gods name is this shit 😔
And remember Badger. Its okay to laugh
6:24 Unemployment scene
Dripping but at what cost
Bananakin Peelwalker in the house.
You could've made the joke. It's over banankin I have the high ground
I haven’t played BF2 since the since the bug started but god this video makes me miss it so much. Well at least more that I already did. I hope EA just fixes the damn thing
Yo..if you blast a whole planet one of the only things that dont plummet to zero is the number of yearly deaths. So not everything hits zero immediately
not even 20min? stop having a life badger. give me more content so I have more of a reason to live. but I still love you.
Next up we find someway to add Russian badger to halo infinite
Give me more pictures of spider man !
Just snorted 15 lines of Crayola Crayons. I am hyped. I am ready. And I am on my way. Be prepared.
0:42 what Minecraft enchantment is that?
Another Great gift for my birthday
Can someone translate the mandoa at the bottom at 0:35? I would but I’m tired
te ef 2 vido when
The mental image of the Emperor or Vader hiding behind a corner listening to a bunch of stormtroopers explaining why blowing up a planet drops the unemployment rate to zero is just too funny not to share.
Fucking everytime I watch one of your videos I laugh so fucking hard
Another great video
Glad to see at least one last bf2 video plus this is definitely one of the best😂
My mans is literally just an alpha-shitter
Current no workie where i live
Bf2 is so good
"It's over bananakin I have the high ground" Obi-Wan Canteloupi
Badger: why am i demonetized in every video? Also Badger: 9 fucken Alec jokes in a row
Well, well, well if it isnt the guy who got me to give up monster for gamersupps. Thank you for that. I really enjoy the pineapple cocktail.
Will you ever make a new war thunder video?
The black tape over the numbers of the card.  Badger knows his community well.
Jeese badger its not even May 4th yet , chill
Moar badja
Ea abandons game, wont fix, wont ban hackers, still has time to ban mods.
Still using your Crossout badge. Kudos.
wait i was here for this stream
GOD I LOVE THIS VIDEOS
The amount of effort and variety in the edite is amazing, you just hear him using game sounds from a wide variety of games and also just the references in genreral are god tier
First video 2022 let's gooooooo
Mans missed out on the flame trooper right click plus my mans missed out on when arc trooper could cross map right click anyone
Bananakin fuckin Skywalker?
Play Dark Souls or I will dark your soul
"Which fucking camera should I be looking at?" Includes PoV camera. Good luck with that one chief
This is DEFINITELY NOT ruining the star wars franchise, if anything it's improving it
I'm sorry but is that Bananakin Skywalker at 2:10 ?!!?!? holy shit that's a good mod XD.
Am I tripping or does badger look like Luke Carder in Inscryption.
Badger got that Vegeta hair.
Air soup is a family specialty.          Even better when you have a bowl to put it in, too.
What I would give to join a session with the boys
13:45 POV you’re Stilt Man
Cn u do a tf2 vid seems like it would be a good addition to the channel
fun fact dark souls remastered considers your hair cut receding just a fun fact
i find it funny how after badger uploads a video the servers get filled like bruh
"Master chief, mind telling me what you are doing on that franchise?" "sir, Mods"
I just realized every planet is basically a country in the star wars universe
The little dances at the end never cease to make me smile.
He's close to 600 vids lez go
ALEC BALDWIN NOOOOOO
Im surprised you havent done Warframe yet, game is free to play.
as a 14 year old I love the fact I'm such a fan I watched the last star wars video before it got age restricted
Can we gay a r6 vid soon Ik u probably won’t I just want one
I don't know if you will ever see this badger but here I go. I don't know if you know it but recently kyber private matches was released. Now this allows you to host/join private servers, as expected,  but you can create/join public servers too and also there is no 1hp exploit. The big deal with it though isn't that, the big deal is that you can create servers with any kind of mod without the fear of getting banned, I think you know what shenanigans can be done with that. Now is it safe? From what I heard yes but personally I wait some more time to see if they aren't safe.
I NEED MOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
I almost threw up laughing. That is a first! Phenomenal!
No planet, no unemployment problem
I’ve played death trooper and wreck the server I’m in but I’ll still lose 🥲
Glassing a planet solves unemployment? Well it worked ish well for Tatooine and Taris before the Death Star so it works well enough.
Yo badger [spoiler for "What If..."] In the marvel show What If on Disney+  mustafar appears for a second so marvel is in the star wars universe or the other way around.
No joke, I know a guy that has one of the salacious b crumb puppets from the movies that he commisioned a prop maker to make a pedestal from Jabba's palace for it to sit on.  Probably the most over the top, nerdgasm inducing thing I have ever seen.
*hm*
yo this game is gonna be popular again
Pog new vid
Is current really that good I'll try it, thanks badger only took few minutes now I have an account to bank with sweet
Should let Badger and the gang rewrite the sequels. Make Bananakin skywalker canon
You guys should try out OG Battlefront 2, lots of the same stuff this one has with a healthy serving of old-so-you-can-do-whatever-you-want-with-it
@6:53 you can hear the god himself Salacious B. Crumb
Dey put da Master Cheef in da Ster Wers.
You should try plants vs zombies garden warfare 2 it legit has the best multiplayer ever
WOULDN'T BE A BADGE VIDEO IF THERE WASN'T SOME IMMENSE SOUND EXPLOSION UNDER 5 SECONDS
Badger really doin  that taken fence scene LOL
Salacious B Crumb is my favorite too
mah boi badger back at it again let’s go
Every single one of these videos are easily worth the wait
dont worry badger, you cant ruin star wars more than disney
so like…tf2 but newer
What's cool is star wars battlefront II has custom servers now. You can now use character mods online using custom servers. I forgot what it's called but it's a mod.  Edit: They are called Kyber servers. Definitely great if you plan on doing a third Star Wars Battlefront II video.
Now I have a big question will you do a video of Team Fortress 2 with your mates just messing around
2:44 Buh-buh-buh bubba fett
Thatcher would go insane in Star Wars with the amount  of fookin lasers
ayo this came out on my birthday, this amazing
watching this before it also gets age-restricted
Badjur? Why are the memes dead badjur
Head cannot outsmart boolet.
Can we beg Microsoft to buy ea so they have a reason to fix there shit?
MOAR PAYDAY2 .......please
Fucken bannanakin 😂
Badger, you good bro? can yall blow this up, he seems a bit tired or stressed. Just want to make sure one of my favorite youtubers is okay.
If Badger made a titanfall 2 vid with the northstar client, that shit would be ballin
best content so far. I'm glad the YouTube Algorithm god's we're smiling upon me and my insomniac ass this morning cause I was wondering how hard I was gonna laugh when I saw this? I wasn't disappointed, you're a King who just got a new sub, please keep the dipshit dumpster trash comedy coming!!! 😂 😆
We all remember the iconic duo of Spider-Man and Master Chief fighting side by side
I think the sith trooper lines is oppressing minority’s
You should do a tf2 video
another one of the most entertaining persons on this platform
80% shit 5% starwars 15% post
Your Battlefield 2042 beta video was so enjoyable that I got Battlefield 2042 as a last minute Smissmas gift. Thx Badger.                                                       Oh and if your not already, please make a vid on the full release if you see this..
Badger is literally everyone's once a month cure for happiness man is on another lvl for content creator
6:18 Why Can i relate to these kinds of discussions…
FINALLY, THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND POSTED!!!
I wonder if he plays team fortress 2?
Ayo hol up  *WHOOOOOO*
15:53 Wait, Badger's married?
Americans only just modernising their banking systems is hilarious.
4:17 look like him going to teach me a lesson in trickery
Got to admit EA fucked up when they only gave jet troopers to the first order. As a clone or a stormtrooper you get booster packs basically you don't have a jetpack that you can hold a button down and fly with
We not just gonna sit here snd hear badger say he is packing heat like Alec Baldwin🤣🤣🤣
Badger turned himself into a stormtrooper it’s the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
BADGER: Glass the plant , it will solve all problems permanently. My Brain: It doesn't make sense , don't do it ! My Heart: I believe him , lets do it
8:46 has the same energy for me as, "He's got a sword!" "You idiots, we've all got swords!" 🤣
9:25 now you're hitting me with TF2 nostalgia come on man
You should download kyber mod it lets you mod so much more
Play prototype and make a video out of it pls
Battlefront 2 : "damn we dont have a big update for 2 years now" Team Fortress 2 : "welcome to the team , soldier"      *the game that doesnt have an update for 4-5 years now*  P.S: i feel like BF2 is literally the ea version of TF2
Wish console had mods too
7:56 the original Star wars battlefront 1 loading screen sound
cringe
Freedom of speech without going bankrupt
Badger, some forms of gasoline are literally made from peanut oil, which is just one step away from Peanut Butter. I know you're talking about it being potentially edible, but i mean . . . some of us have to get high *SOME* how. So still accurate, just in a completely different direction :B
Ray getting cooked like a hot pocket. The good ending.
I am so happy
The invincibility thing wasn't hackers it was just a battlefront bug so it was on every platfrom
BATTLEFRONT IS BACK!!!!!!!
Thank you I love these videos
Rey? Respect? Never use both in the same sentence
You Gotta Help Out Heavenly
Battlefront is so much fun, even with all of its problems.  The core combat loop is very addictive when you don’t take it seriously. Go in, kill, die, repeat. That’s what you’re expected to do as fodder at the beginning. Then you get that power rush when you build up to those heroes and unique classes.
Isnt the game currently unplayable?!
Why the FUCK does badger not have any more subs than what he's got, like honestly wheres the support?!?, The humor, entertainment and editing is fucking perfect and it's low-key retarded he don't got more subs, especially by today. Smh
Man how is your content so consistently amazing
5:30 - 5:37 Gamer sups everywhere
This video definitely made my day
Had a look at your twitch knew this was coming ;)
If you like server hopping due to exploiters you should play tf2
Officer main gebrak grave can suck my space glock
Finally a badger video for over fifty fucking years
Nice stream btw
Badger, you look like Luke Carder
Sucks that battlefront II is broken af
I literally watched badger since the days of battlefield 3 and honestly seeing his descent into utter madness. *FASCINATING.*
10:29 is comedy
He is salacious b crum now
bananakin start panicin, i don’t have a planakin
Yay new video! Im commenting while waiting for the survey to go away.
Kaif and Badger uploading in the same day? It's a sign, the world is finally ending!
Why can I like a video only once?! XD
Anyone else hear a female voice say "Heavenly are you okay?" at 9:16 ?
Can you do a tf2 video
Ever since badger broke through the softcap in Comedy with thousands of dollars invested in technology this channel has proven to be peak comedy
they put master chief in the star wars
Man said the add was in 2 minutes and was actually 3, dislike, unsubscribe, report for terrorism
BTW that legalization poster is old as of 3/31/2021 pot is legal for recreational use
youtube restrict and demonetize the lit dream's you make, RIP
I love your videos badger thay are amazing keep it up 😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘💓💓
I love star wars and will always love Star Wars!
I've never heard the name, Salacious Crumb, more in my life.
the reinforcements arent that much stronger. those players were just bad. with the right tactics and cards any character in this game is easy prey or hard to kill.
I didn't realize this was a new video
This guys packin heat like Alec Baldwin LOL
I love how y'all complain about you're game but y'all forget tf2
I thought I knew your power But this is another level of power I have been humbled
Bananakin
I didn’t know who Salicious Crumb was, but I do now.
Badger why tf are you running resourceful over bounty hunter for your heavy class at 6:50
HOW THE HELL DID THIS MAN GO FROM "EA made up clankers" to knowing who the almighty crumb is?
Ok, he returned to Battlefront, how long do you think we will need to ask  to get a Fallout New Vegas Dlc video
non-heroes are weak? *have you heard about snipers, combat officers and heavies who actually know how to aim?*
too bad Lucas doesn't own StarWars its Disney
so lemme get this straight EA will ban you for cosmetic mods that only affect your gameplay, but will allow hackers to make the whole server invincible? sounds reasonable
More Bubba
When you comment hours later because why not? Bringing up Republic Commandos because I miss Sev, and Fixer, and Scorch, and Boss. I miss Republic Commando in general.
BRO IM HIGH ASF AND SALISTIUOUS IS ONE OF MY FAV CHARCTERS!!!!! THIS SHIT GOT MEE GEKIN LOVE U BADGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE EVEN SAID SALACIOS BBBBBBBB CRUMB HAHAHAH. BET HE WONT PIN THIS FOR THE NEXT VID!
Your the only YouTuber that I can watch their sponsor ad, because your interacting in them.
Badger needs to do a video on Republic Commando
Glamrock Freddy Heavenly is something I never knew I needed and I want more of it 😂😂😂😂
Anakin skinwalker
it's so sad the game in current situation is basically fucked, because of the cheat/bug
Yo Badger is married??? What????
I thought he was about to say hey I’m sponsored by blah blah Buy this NFT
someone should show badger og battlefront  Also deep rock. Perfect for banter.
Nonsense Badger, you can't ruin the Star Wars franchise any harder than Disney, EA, and even George Lucas have already. If anything this has made it better. Funny how EA will ban your ass for modding a dead unmoderated game tho lol
Im depressed he didnt make the clones and droids into lego people
I keep forgetting that you upload videos
Never expected the monkey lizard simp but go my man
I was kinda hoping for a Halo Infinite video or somethin, but this is fine too.
heh.
Wait, badger is married???
Ah Geneva convention Geneva suggestion You bet your ass I'm buying an M2 flamethrower!!! We goin make the chicken EXTRA cwispy! We're going to turn the salad that is the law into chicken McNuggets  Badger will never be cringe, The universe has forbidden it! (use this comment in a video somewhere THE UNIVERSE DEMANDS IT, Have a nice day thank you for shopping at WuWmart) *Side fact* Tom Cruise is 5' 7" so am I.. so he's a Gremlin.. Nah worse he a leprechaun.
So basically add doom slayer into the game got it
Badger: "You can't glass a fucking planet and say "I did it to solve the unemployment problem"" Me, a Stellaris player: Surpasses Hitler approximately 500,000 times just to reduce lag.
How the hell is this video closing in on 1 milion views in ten minutes
That IP joke with Halo sure hit the spot with the current Star Wars show lmao
Spiderman is lore in star wars.
Can you play TF2 badger cuz it's kinda fun
its a shame the games dead now. hope this video gets more people playing it
You can run but you can't hide from R6 Extraction
Hey badger is there a chance that you and the boys will play tf2?
When banger plays the jet trooper "They fly now?"
6:05 sounds alot like a game I play VALVE ....PLZ TF2
“It’s over Banakin,I have the high ground!”
What you call genocide, I call based.
In a nutshell: Star Wars, but it's the Family Guy parody, but it's better.
play team fortress 2 you 600 decibel destroying animal
These people make me laugh uncontrollably
I like how Badger specifically mentions how EA doesnt like mods that do more than just cosmetic online like the BF2 community hasnt made their own private servers for game changing mods and an actual anti cheat so the games arent constantly broken. Kyber is amazing for that.
9:17 someone random in the background "heavenly are you ok?" XD
Badger is just something different, but in a good way.
you shoud play on custom servers next time
I enjoy massing around in SW BF2 with friends, but had to go private servers due to all those immortal matches
If you think that if it'd a mode for star wars where U can play spider man as a hero class ...  And badjer's not gonna play it ... Y'all are on some fu&*$king shiiit
I so happy this came out, but the unemployment rate is UNDEFINED! You know what that means? You don't have a problem after you glass the planet! You can have zero people and zero jobs, and doesn't matter which is the divisor, because you are dividing by zero. No problem, because we cannot define it.
Dae purt der murscher cherf urn de balfrun
It's over Bananakin!!!
Siege video when?
we are blessed once again
“Heheh subwoofer go voommmmmmmmmmm”
Doot
Badger you should play team fortress two how much more chaotic could the game be with the gang
U can make private severs
I love how badger says they're going to ruin star wars like that wasn't past-tense at this point. Go ahead and lite the Porto-poddy on fire my guy, it was already push down a hill into 6 lanes of on-coming traffic.
Been watching you for months and somehow wasn’t subbed.
Bwah HA ha haaaaa! 😂
try out the kyber servers they arent run by ea
btw THeres Kyber private servers u can run mods on without getting ban
Ah yes another star wars video but with spider man.
I'm going to fill up the Grand Canyon with lucky charms and eat it with a comically large soup ladle
I picked up battlefront and started playing it yesterday because of your first battlefront video. It's super fun with friends but you do get clapped by heroes and the reinforcement classes regularly.
Badjur I'm at least 9 shots+ of tequila tonight in so I'm not gonna remember half the shit that happens in this video but I can tell from the beginning of the video that shit is gonna be lit. God bless. 👌
90% of youtubers 10 adds in 5 minutes.Badger : We dont do that sh@t here.
Badger really out here using the original sound effects from the OG battlefront games for his animations! Respect 😤🙌🏻
I used to be so excited when badger videos came out, and for those of you who still enjoy, I'm happy for you. Since he started doing the Mo Cap,  75% or more of the videos are just mo cap and they are hardly enjoyable to me anymore. It's a shame I used to love watching all the in game shenanigans he got up to paired with his commentary. I guess I should catch the streams cause I am just not entertained by these videos anymore.
The editing in this video is amazing keep up the good work badger
13:45 I understood that reference
Mods you like? Play titanfall 2 northstar :)
Badger if you want it have lots of fun playing this game download the kyber server mod
It has to be said that Asuka Kazama was not a character I was expecting to see in one of your videos, but I ain't complaining.
Can we see a tf2 video sometime?
YES
Finally Something fun to watch
LETS FUCKING GO
This is nothing compared to what Kathleen Kennedy did to star wars
Amazing video
This is hilarious
Love how you just complimented your friend for like 60% of the video :))
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This game runs like a potato on my gaming laptop
I would be terrified I saw master chief on like iduno boggano
honey wake up russian badger just uploaded
Is it just me or would a team fortress 2 video be funny as hell
I’m personal friends with  the Jakeanator bodegaboysaint can I get a like ?!
11:56 Can we please go one video without an M1 Grand ping jk :)
How in the name of Yoder did you get on the trending tab AT ALL, but number 7 my guy! WOW
“You’re too late spiaduh man, weed has been legalised!” Me, a Californian, “waaaaaay too late”
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Finally a new video
Did anyone else feel like this video was only 5 minutes long?
Pure funny juice 🤣
next video should definitely be on either Plants Vs Zombie Garden Warfare One or Two, same style, dumbass plants and head empty zombies
Yes, another one
Wait, badger has a wife?
"Me and the homies destroy the Star Wars universe," as if it weren't already at that point.
Badgers widow peak is just a resting area for aviator goggles. Change my mind
We need a Disney+ series of badger and his squad in the Star Wars universe as stormtroopers. Literally it would just be the most random shit imaginable. They could call it simply “Troopers” or something like that.
Sometimes Badger just uses a soundbite from my childhood and it gives me whiplash every time
Commando droid is also a crazy good class. Can out run Jedi and go toe to toe with them with the sword and the gun does insane damage, real nutty class.
holy shit he back , this bouta do numbers on everyones braincells
Russianbadger's straight up GIVING OUT MONEY with this sponsor
Let’s gooooo
Gamersupps ordered with Badger code. Now upload a video more than once a month. Or else.....
you should do a Metal Gear Rising video
Mad respect to any creator who can make their sponsor segments funny and worth watching.
Unbrittled joy and agony in one video
"Kirby just clapped Mauls cheeks" are words I never thought id ever hear in the same sentence.
9 hours early let's gooooo
Jet trooper is cosplaying as a Destiny Striker Titan
Just got my jar of guacamole gamer fart today
Dad just posted
Anyone know where you can get the 3d models of the Imperial Navy Commandos on the left  in the background at 1:36 and 1:43? Really looking to find out if they're part of a mod or are models that can be used in SFM or something.
Another badger video = another chance to steal his content to assimilate into my personality
BASED and cringe….5:26
Someone gonna tell him most of those kills are bots
Your opinion is invalid
I was literally thinking about Bajur and he blessed us with a video.
When TF2 Vid?
"The ability to speak does not make you intelligent!"
>the text on the bottom of the "please wait" screen is in actual mando'a Man
me sitting here watching this after i just went to dollar tree getting a type c charger for a device that didn’t come with one to charge it while in dollar tree a lady wants to go first in line so i let her and then proceeded to tell me ab her kids leaving her and that everyone goes to dollar tree longest 15 minutes of my life. 😐
Bro this shit was fucking HILARIOUS, streams had me on the Floor laughing, and i couldnt catch my breath the whole ass video, i was wheezing so much Amazing work Badger
Yes!!! Thank you! I was so excited for you to come back to this game!
"Salacious B. Crumb"  The "B" stands for...
You guys should play tf2
Good video, but I think you should shorten the preamble and focus more on the clips of you and your friends cracking jokes.
That the Master Chief mod doesn't give him a Beam Sword seems like a missed opportunity.
The amount of god tier content that could’ve come out of this channel if EA didn’t abandon this game during the height of its popularity.
More Serotonin for my brain 🧠
Badger, you're just upset that Arbiter reduced Reach's unemployment rates to zero
It is I, LordHaveMercy1 I spent all those dimmadollars on this piece of sh- in all seriousness though Badger has given me years of entertainment and probably one of the only good content creators on YouTube left and I wanted a way to say thank you and a way to kick off the new year. Thanks badger and keep doing what you do
TheRussianPoggers has posted
Seeing heavenly as Freddy fucking fazbear will always be the funniest shit to me
badgers married??????
SINCE WHEN WAS BAJUR MARRIED
Worth the wait, just like every other vid badger makes 👏
here at 669.000 views
Good, that's one less loose end.
Eyo one of us gotta translate that arabesh-
badgers fuckin married?
Is it just me or does he shoot someone in the beginning of every one of his videos now
Imagine getting idly shot by a Deathtrooper who's busy on comms with a spam call about his starship's extended warranty.
The red troopers gun grenade sounds like a old vidieo game sound effeckt
Will never tire of the shenanigans.
Salacious Crumb is love, Salacious Crumb is life
Now i remember why Im subscribed
Warframe video juen?
After this, I'm fully expecting a 'fake gun' collection of cosmetic mods to eventually become a thing.
I may hate the swearing but good god I love these guys, they make me want to play games I wouldnt otherwise have heard of, like Enlisted? Never heard of it but now it's top of my list to play next. The humor and energy is perfect, keep up the amazing work, lads
If the First Order had just used the sith troopers and mass-produced those guys, they might have actually won
Shit in early
Whoa badger worked in finance.
I just realized that one day, there might be a Badger video with Soviet Womble in it, which would really blow my mind as Womble isn’t that big of a shitposter, but might end up getting dragged in by his circle of friends.
Content is better when your drunk and high this is amazing
Badger: "If George Lucas saw this, he'd probably choke on his own tongue."  Me: "Nah still better than the sequels"
Oh my god Thanmk you. as someone who mods the absolute crap out of thise sarcastic joke of a game finally someone big said something about the 1hp bug cause i just wanna go back to slapping yoda in the face with a pixelated lightsabed shaped as fred flinstones baton
I salacious crumb'd watching this
The Cringe is Strong with this one...
Oh not they reached modding video games this is going to be great
literal GOATED .....
Rey got the Salamander's greeting.
Does Badger really have a *wife* since when?
Jokes aside, I think the special classes are pretty lore accurate. I mean, have you seen the death troopers background? A regular class can kill them though, just not a lot of good players left, hardly any if we are being honest.
i currently lose some brain sells
Gotta singup to current so I get that 500$ badger bucks
Burger married??
Badger no disrespect but u look like dollar store Vegeta.
Rip Halo Reach 2010-2022
yoo there could be a lot of crazy shenanigans in Deep Rock Galactic with a squad like this
“Packing heat like Alec Baldwin”. AAAAAAAHHAHAHAHAHA. This video is definitely getting demonized
You know the day is good when Badger uploads
dey poot deh mampster chief in de soder
BADGER’S FUCKING MARRIED??
There must be one home run ragdoll per video now
How did nobody say Bananakin Skywalker?  Edit: Fuck, I fell for one of the classic blunders
not gonna lie hearing the old battlefront sounds brings me depression badger since i loved that game im go geneocide some ewoks to feel better now
Salacious B. Crumb Salacious Bodacious Crumb Bodacious Crumb
The moment you mentioned immortality it remainded me of the very first multiplayer experience that I had was exactly that, except that I loved it because that basically meant I could just fist fight everyone and managed to level the assault class A LOT.
Badger has a larger budget than Ubisoft's For Honor devs
I love your videos badger. Have me laughing so hard every video
its over bananakin i have the high potassium
Badger, if you ever play Team Fortress 2, I will shit a house.
Why are you so obsessed with salacious crumb🤔🤔🤔
Me when I see a RussianBadger video in my sub feed : 👀
Badger, you should get your friends to play warframe, i'd like to see what you come up with
The only video on the gaming trending page worth watching.
Holy smokes less than 10 seconds in and I'm already being visually assaulted by Spiderman with a lightsaber. This channel is ridiculous and that's why I watch every new video to the end & then go back & watch some older ones.   Thank you for making consistently great content!
I'm on mah nefarious shit.
Solacius Crumb better be at DisneyLand or we’ll be disappointed
Damn badger out here referencing TF2 now I wanna see a TF2 vid now
Apparently a fix is on the way for the 1hp issue.
So uh I know the game is a few years old. But will we ever get a RDR2 video
9 hours and already #6 trending for gaming 👍
Ah, why am I not surprised Bananakin makes a return? Next is Obean Wan Kenobi..... The more I watch these videos, the more of my brain cells die and I love every minute of it!
I like how they recognized badger and his friends in the ingame chat
Hearing these guys talk about the galactic unemployment makes them seem like legitimate stormtroopers  Its concerning
BANANAKIN SKYWALKER
i can't imagine that fight scene with rey and kylo in the forest without rey getting burned alive now
I mean Joe Biden basically killed the united States over unemployment
Between uploads I watch all your old videos like a crack head trying to get his fix
Bruh, I knew I wasn't the only person who knew that Salacious Crumb was hands down the best Star Wars character.  Forget Jar Jar, that laugh is unforgettable.
I can’t believe this game was cancelled to put all hands on deck for BF2042
First order: bad lore, good classes.
I’m not saying that you should make a mocap suit rendition of Red vs Blue, but what I am saying is if you made a mocap suit rendition of Red vs Blue I would shit my pants
Yes
god these videos never fail to make me crap my pants laughing
... well, crap, now I really wanna get Battlefront
Bannanikin Skywalker XD
Glamrock Freddy just popping up out of nowhere really caught me off guard.
I need to see badger play hunt showdown now. It would be amazing and hella fun to see what he does
Selacious Bingus Crumb
Badger please use Scooby-Doo as a avatar for a video. Thats be so funny
Badger didn't ruin the move by burning Rey during her fight with Kylo Ren, he saved it.
Idk why but before the mocap suit the jokes seemed to hit harder because of how snappy the animation was, now it feels a bit off. Still like it tho  Edit : Nvm I fucken lied lmfao this shit funny as hell
I only play battlefront with the boys
Im just leaving these here for my own amusement, enjoy them if you wish 5:25 6:39 7:46 8:25 My fav, 10:29 15:40
Salacious B Crumb
BADGE make a payday2 vid now pls
Cringe storm trooper Chad riot trooper
I wish current was available in the UK but sadly it's not
RussianBadger love your videos man, and i hope you are doing well! Prank em alec.
5:33 From this pint on the Unkindled One is now beloved by all star wars fans, simply for deleting Rey.
I love how you could say anything and it'd be funny, just say "Pineapples" next episode and see how we react
Another top tier shitpost
I’m just saying, no homelessness on Alderaan
oh SUUUURE!~ Badger makes one joke about slaves and he gets hit by YouTube        but meanwhile we have Naked Yoga and those super sexual ads and YouTube's like "this is fine". let me repeat myself: NAKED! YOGA!!! and i know viewers aren't just doing it for the Yoga part!
Salacious B. Crub
Yo badger you should try Deep Rock Galactic with a few of your friends
Alright well…..dancing scout trooper at the end was just the best.
the hairline still retreats
Baugr took a month and a half for the next video because he mocap suited the entire intro
Like a bantha!
Oh god here we go again
4:15 all he needs now is a solascias crumb body pillow and he is set
What did you think would happen. When Disney  bought out both.
the biggest news of this video is that the Vegeta with a receding hairline we keep watching for screwball content used to work in finance.     is this how 2008 happened?
like half the footage uses bots lol
These video's are my crack man .. im always jonesin
Seeing Freddy say cringe is something I didn’t know I needed
To anyone else who wants to translate the text at the bottom of the screen at 0:35-0:40, it's the Mandalorian rune font, and it's all gibberish. Come on badger! That was an easy missed opportunity to call me a damn nerd.
"pov: you tried to sell a eighth in NY"  In NY even Peter Parkers plug would be Flash Thompson
badger uploads make me happy
OH NO HES TAKIN ADVANTAGE OF THE RAGDOLLS NOW OH NO
Bro I'm waiting for Salacious Crumb's new hit single: Crumping on that Beat
wait burgier is married? wot in the hell
10:09
I'm sorry, but why the fuck! is glamrock freddy here XD I have water all over my computer screen now
Spider-Sense vs Jedi precognition does sound interesting
Do a siege video
We need more BF2 videos, like Return of the Cringe, and Revenge of the Based.
I definitely like the idea of Heavenly being Mando.
Do a siege video
Should play deep rock galactic
Virgin stormtrooper: -piss poor aim -shitty armor -bad guys -use plasma weapons  Chad Clones: -Some were trained by mandolorians -personally fitted armor to maximise protection and mobility -God aim -good guys  Gigachad Mandolorians: -Mandolorians -Beskar armor fitted personally like the clones -Virtually have aimbot -So you can deflect lasers, huh? How about I pop a cap in your ass? -Neutral group, will fight whoever attacks them first
Wait until he finds out about modded community servers.
Pls mocap someone in your next video cripwalking
God I fucking love Salacious B. Crumb
First episode of 2022 and i already know the Battlefront II servers are gonna fill again
Get a man that looks at you the way Badger looks at Salacious B. Crumb
Badger is married?
Id be honest Badger, If you and Your squad were ever drafted into the army then deployed to the battlefield, God have mercy uppon those who you were fighting and those who command you and your squad
This is a great video, loved the all the atf and Baldwin jokes
Watched the last battlefront vid 5 hours ago wtf
Wowowowowow I love it
The Alec Baldwin bit nearly made me spit my water 😂🤣
DIGI
"BaDgE hAs A wIfE???" If I'm not wrong that was the chick in the Left 4 Dead 2 vid when the Fall Guys had their states of matter changed, also SF baby let's go.
10:21 And that is exactly why you liked 2042. Not because it was in any way good, but because your friend group could make watching paint dry fun.
“Prank em Alec” you already know!”😭
SPIDER MAN that guy from fortnite
i literally went monke mode when i saw this... bruh.
Packing heat like Alec Baldwin😭😭
God damn epic
MaRrIeD !?!?!?!?
Bro the most funni man with good taste of mods
bro i love you so much badger you have made my day for years i have died every time i watched your vids. thank you so much man you are awesome.
Hello there.
I would love to see you and your crew playing with the guys from worst premade ever!
"The class shootin back at you is packin' heat like Alec Baldwin."  *Badger over here not afraid to flame a man*
Yeah they fixed the bug
2:53 is the humor ever
banger like always
Honestly I'd love to have Badger meme the F out of 40k, it's just sad that there's no 40K games to meme the F out of
On the subject of abandoned, several-year-old games  New R6 Siege video when?
Don't forget the king of shitposting still has a gsupps flavor
I was once playing with my friend and randomly sniped him out of the sky as Chewbacca while he was using boba fett
Nice
Seriously tho, props to Badger for actually knowing what species Salacious B. Crumb is
Badjur be like: I'm going to try and convince you to use this credit card through the power of overwhelming shitposting.
Bananakin
Did he install the night & day Utapau map mod?
The drugs have arrived
"You can't glass a planet because it would solve the unemployment problem"   Me in stellaris that has already destroyed four due to pops not having jobs "Oh really?"
I swear to fuckn god bro if I watch one more new video at the end of a marking quarter while I’m on 2 hours of sleep I’m gonna rupture an organ while absolutely pissing myself laughing; my dumbass does not have the mental strength to handle this kinda bullshittery and not go absolutely ape shit laughing
when did you get married?? (if joke) .....ok (if not joke) congrats
I literally audibly said that this couldnt be a new video because the Thumbnail looked outdated
I hope you have your current card tied to a secondary account, not your primary account that has all your money in it. Card theft online is very common.
Play some rainbow six siege badger
they turned Anakin into a banana Morty!
Badger play the community modded version of battlefront 2, they got a lot more weapons and even added heroes like Jango Fett and The Mandolorian
you described tf2
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say, Badger likes crumb.
Any f reason why it's f long for you to upload a video
Bananakin
16:28 Behold: the "I'm mocapping in my bedroom" dance.
Bro my gamer tag literally LoudogX…nice
Lol starts with a solid minute of him just fucking around with the motion capture suit
Why tf is guece glamrock freddy?😂
we need game reviews like spider man
badger if you want true chaos should look at Galactic Contention mod on squad, literally milsim star wars that you can literally have full scale battles
6:18 Yeah the unemployment rate is too LOW, gotta fix that asap
It's been a while since I tuned in to a badger video ... So like I'ma keep it 100 with you chief ... When did your animations suddenly become fucking next level !
Day 1 of asking badger to do a TF2 stream/vid
He finally uploaded I was this close from pulling up to his house in a Batman costume
I know my man has made a Fallout 4 video before, but the mod scene has really developed into a whole new monster since 2016. That and Fallout 3, now that the game is actually playable on Steam after nearly a decade.
Badgers married?
I love how the execution of a fake creature and fake slaves get demonetized but the Witcher sex scenes stay up
Please make a tf2 Video to save the game.
Please make a tf2 Video to save the game.
Crumb terrified me when I was younger
Badger is married? :0
HELLL YEAAAA BROOOTHHERRRR!!!! ANOTHER BADGER VIDEO!!!!
You guys should do a video on a game called rubber bandits, it’s amazing

Fucking shit up Badger how do you keep improving each video?!

Idk Badger it’s not really a Current sponsorship if you don’t show us that there are numbers on the card and also ones on the back
Go to Europe stuuuupi’d ad
The importance of great friends is empirical in every badger video
Dude what’s that master chief song am an PlayStation kid I don’t know anything about halo
You guys make me laugh so fucking hard. Keep up the good work and keep on flaming Rey.
If the Badger Squad was in a new Star Wars movie, I would watch that ASAP
9:13 I had to pause I died laughing.
Still better than the last three Star Wars movies!
Bad news, your New Vegas video just got  age restricted.
Anyone decipher what it says at the bottom at 0:39?
"me and the homies ruining starwars", Pretty sure Disney is doing that by itself...
Coward let us see the the card numbers..  For science
Man’s got #6 on gaming trending
The production value of this one video exceeds that of all 3 sequel movies combined
Pepperidge farms remembers the ps2 release of battlefront 2. Pepperidge farm remembers
Just as I'm about to hit another mental spiral, you show up like anti-depressant jesus and give me another chuckle. Thanks again, Mr. Badger.
The fact that some people have forgotten about the Bananakin meme and are calling him banana walker instead saddens me
Badger lookin like Tom Hanks
I have the high ground bananakin
Hol up Badger is married? Now the dad jokes make sense
Fun fact: the stream was live 3 months ago
It's such a cool game, but it is a shame the hero units utterly dominate the game so it just becomes about which side has the better hero players rather than an actual war.
NEW RUSSIAN BADGER VIDEO LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Was this video demonized?
01:0 sounds likw the ol d fortne
im starting to think badger really likes salacious b. crumb
Do not disrespect the droids
Zero unemployment >>>genocide of entire planet
Imagine if he gets his hands on the separatist commando Droid 😭😭
Hampter
I found an old ps2 and started playing the original BF2 recently. It’s fun
nice
you guys should totally play sea of thieves i know ur never gonna see this but i have to say it
Bananakin Skywalker
Badger turned himself into a banana, funniest shit I've ever seen!
Bro. I was just playing this 30 minutes before work
God dammit these videos always make my day.
What the fuck?
I could be doing homework right now, but homework is assigned to be ignored
that camera bit in the beginning made me smile. thanks
love u
If anyone knows where  the camera change sound comes from, your a real one.
Marvel and Star Wars in the same room. Now all we need is DC!  (By DC I mean preferably Nightwing but that’s just me)  Badger praising the First Order Jet-trooper and Sithtrooper made me so happy. Master Chief was just the Cherry on top!  Glorious work as always Badger. Go get that nap. 💯
I can only imagine that “I will break into your house, pay for the damages and all, but replace all of your butter with fucking margin, just because.” Goes with Badger-
Hey Badger funny enough you say that they abandoned the game. EA came out and stated that with everyone returning to the offices that they are going to work on a patch for it. so soon no more blowing up at the start of a round to see if you are going or not going to have fun.
This video is just: man gushes over how great his friends are while toasting the Star Wars Cast
the first order when people first saw them everyone was like "YOOOOOO THEY LOOK SO COOL" but cause of how bad the sequel trilogy ended up being everyone ignores the first order and kylo ren like they are the black sheep of star wars... they are literally just smooth stormtroopers and kylo ren has the coolest sith design in star wars, dont @ me his cape and helmet are dope. but yeah the regular stormtroopers are still better, but don't underestimate the power of the neo-empire aka the first order.
This is great
I don’t regret spending $50 of subs on this man
that little post-credits dance is everything, love it
My parents actually got to meet the voice actor behind Salacius Crumb: Mark Dodson at a Star Wars themed bar party. They managed to get his signature on a poster
A game I want to see him play because of the mods is rivals of aether
Bruh EA only cares if it makes them money it's honestly not a shocker
These videos have been slowly devolving into Badger fucking around with his mocap and the game that the video is about is just filler.
Bruh i just named my star wars squadrons character Salacious B Crumb like last week
I love how one of my favorite games is played by them and I'm hoping it somewhat revives the game since updates are no longer coming
Me: "oh wow this game looks pretty cool lets check it ou-"    BF2: "you're ugly, you're disgusting, I'm gonna kill you, give me 200 dollars"
“I’m out here eating bowls of air soup” best quote
Me Whenever i see badger posted a new video  "HELL YAH THE GOOD SHIT"   XD
So wait badger married?
Y'all should check out those whole modded battlefront 2 servers, actually having people still working on it is probably decently better than dealing with base game.
You are my favorite  youtuber can you pls do some fortnight  but I do not it please  me but you asome
lol i bough battlefront 2 on the lunar new year steam sale and just about 3 days later badger makes another video on it: is this the force?
Mr badger I've been watching all your videos and I got one thing to say good stuff man good stuff
“It’s Gylo Man! Oh God!” - The Grouse, “Space Vietnam With Bears and Lasers”
I once melee killed Darth Vader as Infantry.
What if he did tf2, like I'm just saying that would be chaotic yet funny af
In battlefront ll the arc trooper has the same ability as the sith trooper just with pistols instead of a rifle
God love your content man.                                         Would you mind playing more PayDay2?
potato
IT'S BANANAKIN!
Last episode: it's gylo man!!  This episode: I like it when celatious crumb laughs.
Did he try separatist
Watched him all through 2016-2021,2022 is going to be a hell of laugh for me
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
Bananakin Skywalker
I need to see Badger play Deep Rock Galactic. I know my man is gonna make a great driller.
I love how often Badger credits his friends for how fun the game is. Which is just a fact of life, with a great set of friends you can turn most anything into the best experience possible
Badger reached the highest level of shitposting: Full-Effort Shitpost.
So um, dayz video when?
hold the fuck up. is that a wedding ring at 4:11? if so, CONGRATS
fuckin the last bit with the  not-so-forgettable-person-with-the-name-i-totally-did-not-forgot hitting that A#
Was feeling down and saw this. Thx bager
The amount of time and video editing and animation Badger is putting on his video is amazing! How much you have grown man, how much!
So who’s gonna take one for the team and translate the scrolling text at 0:36?
Flametromper
Every time badger upload it makes my day everytime
Badger getting fucken scary good with the mocap suit. I am acutally terrified.
I just rewatched the other battlefront 2 video lol, Im so happy.
I Love The Beginning Of The Video Starting With A BANG
The Book of Boba Fett really gave the Boba jokes more meaning
hold the gott dam phone how the fuck badger out here with a damn WIFE? that shit aint real
Badger is the man of mitosis with the number of his clones that die in his talking bits
🍌  Bannanakin 🍌
Damn bro charge yo phone
Hey badger I have a video idea why not a tf2 video seem like a good idea to me so why not
Is that another Badger video for me to binge🧐
I got thru laughing with 2 debilitating disease diagnosises and treatment, short term disability for 2 months, organ removal surgery, and my wife having cancer all in 2021 thanks to "Fucking Badge". Only time I laughed at all. Now I'm well, my wife's cancer free and we both blazing on our green cards laughing our asses off tonight. Thanks man, you got us thru all that and fucking Covid during all of it. Dropping a sub and some bits on twitch when we both get back to work, but until then, I'ma blaze and giggle and neither one of us even play games. 😂😂😂
Congrats on #6 trending badgur you crazy f*ck!
I like to eat sponges
Anyone else been wondering whatever happened to Clarence?
This man and dunkey are the very definition of quality over quantity
That end credit song was a fucking BANGER, bgr  You gotta let me know the name of that shit
tags: absurd_res alec_baldwin crumble_b_wallace door_opening fun flamethrower team_fortress_2 kirby spiderman
Also they fixed the exploit btw
Can’t believe badger posted on my birthday, that’s fuckin pog
We need a new r6 vid its been over a year
And I was literally thinking, damn that gamer supps addict hasn't posted in a while, good to know the squads mascot still lives
The fact the last Battlefront video was demonetized over jokes about Jabba the Hutt owning slaves is hilarious because Jabba canonically owned _multiple_ slaves.
moar rwabow six bager
*video starts* "This video sponsored by current!" *nuke goes off* *me who had volume up for previous video*  I am ded
Literally just thought yesterday when you gonna load next
Badger is honestly my favorite YouTuber. Man makes it actually look so fun and not in the "this is fun but I'm super stressed and exhausted with constant upload schedules" kinda way.
Hey badger your videos really brighten up my day keep it up please
Pizza time ganj is great you funny friends funny poyo *halo music*
Badger will always be the king of quality shit posts
everyone of these videos just keep getting more and more chaotic and it is amazing.
idk why but i was expecting a alec baldwin joke
But have you heard about private servers
Badger I should tell you that on my vacation to Orlando I did go to Disney World and get a Baby Yoda Plushie only for the purpose of punting him as far as I can
Now he has to play the community servers that have Jango Fett and shit.
LETSS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"How to tell your producer you don't want to do any more takes"  This fucking killed be cause Alec Baldwin WAS the producer.
damn, the empire struck your content? seriously, what happened? your new stuff is absolute garbage zoomer content, ive been here since some of your first bf3 content so many years ago, wtf happened?
George Lucas would be proud of this video
10:55 destiny one in a nutshell
These vids got me rolling everytime lmfao
10:24 yeah I wish I had a good group of friends like yours honestly
G Y L O M A N
Bannakin Skywalker
Is the 1hp thing really a hack I've been in a coop with only people i know and it still occurred.
Badger broke the Fourth Wall
dont care if im dying of stage 5 ball cancer and havent slept in 9 weeks, i insta click and watch this video
I would love to see you do a video on red dead 2/online one day
There are soooo many other mods that im kinda disappointed they only used like 5
Yo! I remember watching this stream! I’m so excited to see the video put together.
So kinda similar to titanfall 2 northstar servers…
When I see any video hit a month old you already know imma be on watch until you upload
Just seeing me the videos had me rolling—
Kirby ran after Maul like “Im not through with you bitch!” 😂😂
This man makes me wanna actually watch the advertisement
Please check out the kyber servers with your friends it will add so much popularity to them plus more reinforcements
What about the original battlefront? can you still go oldschool and play via “direct connect” with your IP addressed? If so can that be modded to unholy extremes?!
Ah yes, another perfectly normal video from Badger. Absolutely nothing strange about it at all.
BANANAKIN!!!
so fortwars  starnight royale then
Welp time for ROUND 2 of BATTLEFRONT 2 in 2022.
Funny enough I’m high watching this 😝
The fucking rat has a name!? Wut.
16:12 sounds like the intro to that one XXX song
I love how Badger and his friends can make jokes out of anything and make it actually funny, from WW2 to planets being destroyed.
i love you badger you are greatest man for playing bf2
10:47 cries in team fortress 2
I love that Heavenly went from Cacodemon from Doom Eternal to Glamrock Freddy from FNAF: Security Breach.   Talk about a glo-up!
“The class shooting back at you is packing heat like Alec Baldwin.”  Yup, definitely going to hell for laughing at that
BANANAKIN
The amount of work you put even when you can just be playing videogames is honestly why you are a "literal GOAT".
I just want to say that I would happily watch a show about a group of soldiers that act like badgers friends. That would be hilarious
Ay badge, they sell remote control versions of those monkey lizard things and they go on your shoulder
比起遊戲，你的朋友顯然更有趣
This guy's level can cure depression
That last bit with Heavenly had me rolling
Anikan: Obi-wan look, I turned into a banana. I’m bananakin
Theres mah Badgur
Id love to see badger do a video about FF14 or halo infinite
You are a legend
Escape from tarkov video when?
Eyyyyyy would still like to see yall play deep rock galactic tho
You know today’s a good day when badger uploads
I missed you
Digital Vagrant is an epic inclusion into the cluster fuck that is this channel
when badger uploads you know its goin to be a good day
69k likes.
When’s he gonna play tf2
Bananakin Skywalker, perfect
That post credit scene reach my heart, im crying by joy
LOL I gotta find ALL the Salacious Crumb things now thanks to Current. Put that in your sponsored Ridge Wallet LOL.
Never a disappointment putting time in to watch your videos. I just wish I could do more than just watch hundreds of times for clips and a couple comments and my sub from 6 or so years ago. Good work, may you continue to post quality content.
Video two of asking badger to play for honor all jokes aside great video badger
Too bad that this game is now plagued with hackers ruining the experience because it's genuinely one of the only games I've been having fun lately
I really did not need to see Glamrock Freddy point at me, and say cringe. I didn’t ask for this! Lmao
I see that TheRussianBager on my bday. well then shit. this is the best day ever
funniest boomer
RADGERS RARRIED????!?!,!??
This video is 'Certified Based'.
9:22:i feel like i want to play team fortress 2 again
Would have been funny to have no recoil for the motion captured shooting because the guns shoot light instead of a heavy projectile.
bager better make a fucking tf2 video
Happy New Year Bajur
9:25 Cmon badger quit teasing us and play TF2 I beg you!
YOU GOT SCORCH! 62!  He is the best! No voice acting quite like Delta Squad. Wish they had Delta Squad skins for the commandos with voice lines. What a throwback! You boss, even the 3D motion acting was on point for Scorch!
Badger really built like Peyton Mannin's criminal cousin that sells Peyote simply because it's spelt similar to Peyton.
It doesn't count as blowing up a planet when it's a moon 😉
Welcome to Star Wars battlefront II, the game so fun that the devs left it for PvZ2
0:14 BURN IN HOLY FIREEEEE
Theres be an awakening have you felt it?  “Yes”  Badger posted another battlefront video.
I know the name of a good therapist, Badger.  Although, that being said, you can't be saved anyway!  BADGER IS GOAT!
Me and my boys hop back on battlefront 2 last week, then badger makes a new video🤯🤯
This mf married?
Whenever Russian badger posts its like when a stupendium song releases.  Pure joy.
ah yes, my favorite Sith lord, Bully Maguire.
i swear badger needs to play tf2 for a video one of these days seeing how often he references it
Bananas having a lot of potassium is a common misconception. They have very little potassium in reality.
Shit. Already have current.
3:20 I'm sorry badger, I can't take you seriously dressed like that
alec baldwin really got his collat ruined by a hitmarker must suck
Wait I didn't know badger was married, last I heard it mentioned in a video it was gf congrats
Bro finally badger I’ve been waiting for years bro I’ve been waiting since BF5 was good
GOAT
Asuka??!!
I would join a fund raiser to get bager and the crew in a star wars movie just to sit in the back ground talking about the dumist s*** ever to ruin the emersion.  Just imagine "the battlefield a star wars short film" but with bager and the boys but in an actual star wars movie.
And just yesterday I was thinking "You know, I think we're due for another badger video".
This man has top quality vids! And the end, with the speaker, made me think of the movie private parts. If you know, you know. 😂😂
hm hm, jet pack trooper literally better than heroes sometimes
In zombie army dead war 4 there are left4dead characters I chose coach not a mod
0:22 "But YOU'RE the only green thing getting smoked, Goblin!"
This level is the coolest yet! Classic throwback version >>> https://youtu.be/TwUjEZr4aTI 🔥🔥🔥
Goddammit you had to do a Combine voice on a Death Trooper
The unemployment rate could be said the same for when the Death Star blew up!
GOAT of memes.
How on earth do you make these videos? Best content out
Let’s freaking go! Russian badger upload on my B-Day!
for the first time Badger...you've disappointed me...i was expecting Bananakin skywalker to come outta the right side of the screen to kill you while you were dancing and the rest of the video is just him slaughtering the troops back there XD
badgerhaswife?!?!?!??  not click bait!!  real!
Yo what is the song at the end?
You can tell he actually uses that current card because of that 5 layers of tape over ID NUMBERS
Bruh the first was 40 min what happened? You don’t want to exhaust yourself for a soulless website in exchange for pennies anymore?
Man really likes that monkey
but do you own an air fryer? cuz i got 2
Bro a Dragon's Dogma Video but having the crew influence your playthrough like a fucking DnD campaign would be hilarious
Badger I can't say this to really anyone else but your the main youtuber I get hyped for when a video drops
Fun fact. At least in my expiernce. Finn mods are a instant ban if u use dead eye or in general anything..or just playing with him and mods..yay lol I remember using the cody mod in 2018..sad times
You missed the opportunity to say "glassed half full"
Love badger, but once you start hearing the same background sound effects, it reminds me of Johnny Test
Oooo i know this isnt really the channel to take things seriously but _damn_ the Alec Baldwin stuff is _maybe_ a little too early   In case you didnt know what happened, Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed a cinematographer (i think) who was shooting a movie. A Real Bullet was loaded into the gun, instead of a blank. From what I heard, he was absolutely _devastated_ that he accidentally killed a co-worker. And no, the movie will not be released.
Bananakin he actually unironically gave anakin the Lego meme skin
What a start to 2022
Have been out of shape for a while and I lifted some weights while this played, my arm hurts. CORRECTION, I Hurt
LETS GO 6 ON TRENDING GOOD WORK RUSSIAN BADGER KEEP IT UP
This video was a bit to over the top
Next up  q and a with waif

Wasn’t expecting to see Hannah and Irish

Copped some guacamole gamer fart 9000. Shit better be busting or the only thing busting will be some knee caps

The Badger squad would have made a better sequel trilogy

*gets age restricted just for mentioning the reasons for previous reasons for demonitizations*
This video is just how many times can we say crum
Yo, fuck YouTube.
There taking the Hobbits to the sex dungeon,current(sponsor)hiding in a ally way with a sex whip
HOW. How do these keep getting better
I would love another L4D2 video, maybe where they try versus, Expert, custom campaigns, and custom modes.
I wonder what’s next on his crusade Rainbow six siege extraction, dying light 2 or maybe………
My ass laughs at this guy for 12 years i haven't wiped in 13 years and my ass is cleaner then batting 2042
lol xd
i gotta watch more of these videos
badger you should make a movie with the mokap suit that would be glorious
At least its not as bad as tf2 where bots run rampant and are litterally killing the game slowly ruining the game for everyone
damn dude every time you stream I'm always busy and its really upsetting.
The Covenant glassed Reach to help reduce unemployment, homelessness, and food shortages. Its true, it's in the books.
Battlefront 2 is basically Team Fortress 2, abandoned by the devs, has a lot of issues, but still fun
Bc I’m in Memphis I’m only 5 hours late
that intro tho 😯 best intro ive ever seen... animation is craxy
Me who decided to grind bf2 a week ago “ oh shit did I die in this video
#freeTayK
Badger should check out the Kyber servers for this game. I'd like to see him mess around with all the custom reinforcements.
You’re videos are so entertaining, that you even make the sponsor parts of video worth watching!
Damn Anakin is radioactive now. We 40,000 Banankins now
The use of '05 Battlefront II sound effects and the Scorch voice line made my day
We need battletoad with wrist rockets.
Current
9:28 JFK is that you
Yo, you probably won't but, can you play Payday 2 again?
If badger is married then I have a chance
bananakin skywalker
Banger vid
The fact that he actually had imperial navy commandos in this video is awesome because they were only in the PS2 force unleashed
Best part of the “From Fortnite” bit is that all of those guys are there.
I really like the image of Master Chief carrying Kirby on his shoulder. Adorable and Badass.
What happens when he finds out of the unrestricted multiplayer mod support from the kybermod
God the production quality with the mocap and intro and captioning is so next-level with you
I didn't realize it had a name or THIS MUCH MERCH. Seriously Salacious Crumb would be an excellent rapper name
Me: Sees badger has a title with cringe in it “DUTCH I SAW CRINGE DUTCH!”
Obi Gyn Kenobi does not approve
Was that dohvahkin at the bottom there? 😂 0:35
Thank you for bringing new people to this game. Much love.  It's free exp.
4:00 I wonder who Badger's favorite Star Wars character is.
There is a salacious crumb AMONG U.S.🇺🇸
I love you badger. I was sad that when I went to play a couple weeks back I found that the servers were dead. With this vid they will be alive for a few days!
OH FUUUUCK LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Freddy's model just feels right for Heavenly
Among us
Wtf
Wait your actually married 💀
Its a blast to see Battlefront 2 back on the channel, shame the game's coming apart at the seams though
Ah yes, my favorite character from Star Wars, Bananakin Skywalker
I've never heard that badgers married till just now tf. Congrats dude, hope you two have a mad happy marriage:)
I doubt you'll see this comment but funny coincidence. My callsign on my deployment to Afghanistan was Salacious Crumb 🤣🤣
They need their own shit post starwars show
More 40K Deathwing! The Emperor demands it!
all ive used is the "cool-aid jammer" trooper in most my games, kill it then get kicked for being mean lmao
WOO MORE BADGER
THE NUMBERS (On the Debit card) WHAT DO THEY MEAN!?
This is the kind of video that i wish i saw more often  Badger knows how to make video and this it
Play siege again or no sub
why is heavenly glamrock freddy now instead of a cacodemon? im not against it but why
I wish there was some way to watch your old streams
There's something magical about Master Chief shouldering Kirby at the First Order Cookout.
YES!!! MORE BATTLEFRONT!!!
Damn, was looking forward to Gyloman making toast. At least he made a taquito with help from a flame trooper.
Every video of yours brings a smile to my face and me and my friends always have a good laugh keep up the good work we very much prefer quality over quantity
If you play as the Sith Trooper and sprint,  then interrupt the sprint with a melee, you perform a roundhouse-ish kick. It's exactly useless until you want to expressly kick Rey in the teeth while she's magic-pixelling.
Personally, I prefer playing BFII on console, and it's been a lot of fun to play Starfighter Assault.
Play phantom forces On Roblox
This is some quality shitposting. Shut up and take my sub.
"Ruining the Star Wars franchise."  I think that has been done already three times.  *cough* sequals *cough*
NEW VIDEO, NEW REASON TO LIVE.
"maintained"
RussianBadger is the only person who can make ad reads genuinely enjoyable to watch
Oh that sounds like Hive from Destiny.
LESS TALKING MORE GAMEPLAY “mY fRiEnDs aRe sO fUnNy” SHOW US
badger is married to asuka kazama from tekken? yo thats kinda based.
Well atoms don't actually touch just there electric fields so officer no I did not punt that child in the lake.
Dude rb posts along with NOODLE!?!?!
Trust me Badger, after the flaming dumper fire that was the Sequel trilogy, I’m sure Lucas would approve of this. Plus, man’s out here counting his billions, so, I’m sure he sleeps very well in his manor up in Marin County
Need to get Darth Malgus
Cool vid but when’s TF2?
Let's gooo, Another Badger video
When you play team fortress? Would love to see it!
Great animation as always, miss the credit page Thant the animator(s)
He’s married?
Clone commando is def the most dripped out after he was released I dropped a 500 kill game day one
Yoooo what if respawn is making battlefront 3 and it's gonna have characters from the series?? Imagine using ahsoka tano to S L A P the Mandalorian's sheet 😂
I feel like that whole intro was just badger flexing his editing skills.
The return of the king.
I wish bf2 on playstation wasn't dead😒
tf2 pyro
BaDgEr
Need more is all I need to say just based and laughing it makes my day
So let me get this straight. You're playing a game that is several years old, abandoned by it's developers, has hackers ruining the servers, but is still fun to play? TF2 = BF2 CONFIRMED!
Yo when are we getting more seige
If you kill everybody on a planet, then you don’t have to worry about them getting jobs anymore. The empire fixes everything it brutally destroys!
Seeing Naruto in Fortnite was like seeing your childhood hero get arrested for Rape and Murder.
This video is an assault on all my senses and I loved it
bagger
YOU’RE TOO LATE SPIDER-MAN, I’M ALREADY THE SENATE!
Thank you Badger, I needed more content I’ve been watching the best of 2021 too much in the background ☠️
Going bankrupt! lol i have 100$ to my name  but getting married in november fml
Wait, WHAT! Badger is married?? NANI the FUCK??????
The only people between you and top spot on trending Is people are a bit worse then you
i wonder how much polishing after the motion capture there is - but imagine being able to animate any fight scene or shit post you wanted, and source allowing most fucking pretty models  i want the chief locke fight by badgur, is all im sayin
Love Badger, but If you think this game is broken: You haven’t played the new Cod, Battlefield, or Halo.  Halo infinite has more micro transactions now than this game did on launch.
These little rare things are the best I’d love to see more l4d2 and shit
Wait I'm confused. Which one of them isn't going to die alone?
This is a certified salacious b crumb moment
“Me staring at rey spinning as im wating her”
Its great to see his production value keep going up.
love those Star Wars Battlefront II 2005.
Call that shit a microwave
The fear in his voice at 2:27 sounds so real.
Badger has uploaded, I am happy
They put mamster cheef in da battlefront
LES GOOOO IVE BEEN WAITING <3
They reportedly fixed the health issue
WHAT THE FUCK HOW DOES BADER ALWAYS MAKE VIDEOS OF THE GAMES I PLAY
5:08 to Starwars Legends being CONSIDERED NON CANON
Yo its the stormtroopers from fortnite
Team Empire all the way!!!!
like for salacious .B crumb
badgers hairline really still be sayin "V"
honestly id love to see a badger video on modded stalker
yo having that motion capture suit 0 being adept at animatin in source by now, he could 100% recreate anything he wanted with his acting. im glad its limited to shitposting, but imagine a short film by badgur for halo - or just redoing the chief locke fight. itd be epic
anyone else feel like this video has a didferent vibe?
you should play titanfall 2
Badger out here with the funniest content I've seen in a minute
Do we all agree that Halo and Star Wars is an epic collide..? Like we need a game mode of that…
It's over, Bananakin! I have the high ground!
I’ve waited 5 years
it’s funny because 99% of us are too young to have a debit card
5:25  That is going to become a one-frame meme, I swear! It may not go wild, but it'll go places.
When you don’t use code badger  Not because you’re lazy  But because you want others to win
Hey badger I love your vids man but I saw the game you were playing and I said “Oh shit this vid is gonna go sideways” 😅
MY SUBWOOFERS SHAKING DA WALL!!! SEND HELP
Gonk!
Russianbadger’s wife is Asuka Tekken wtf.
Him, as a stormtrooper with a flamethrower, is the equivalent of a teenager with a flamenwerfer
Since the last video I platinumed cyberpunk 2077 and got all as
I am no longer satisfied with Badger only having a Halo Reach video Halo 1 video when
economy cant be shit and full of unemployment if there is no economy
Oh no...      He found out about the mods
wait badger is married?
Badger Married?
7:53 William afton  This comment gonna be dunked so fast
Привет Леха
Make a vide about star wars squadrons
Don't worry man, KK and gang already destroyed the whole thing.
hnnnnggg waif!?!!?!
I love this channel, it’s like me and my friends playing games but it’s just the funny parts
Badger's bank staff trying to figure out just what the fuck IS and ISN'T an "uncharacteristic" purchase on his account.
ayo when we gonna get a vid on tf2? cause if its in a year i can wait
Can't believe they didnt laugh from Bananakin🍌😆
Every time I think hmmmm I wonder if badger has uploaded magically there’s a new video
How did people not know Badger has a girl? He's mentioned having a girlfriend in the past, and that was yeaaaaars ago now. Married Badger is the next logical step.  After all, he's got the Vegeta hair, and Vegeta got himself a girl.
bananakin start panakin badger's playing our game againakin... don't even show me the door I'll just yeet myself out the window
Now make vid on original battlefront 2
The sith trooper will always be the drip trooper to me
WOOOOO BADGER VID YEEEEAAAA
Dude I GOTTA tune into the streams more
I can’t believe battlefront 2 died for BF2042. I really wish we got Ashoka.
0:30 SFM fun fact: There is an ATST vehicle on the GMOD workshop that comes with a walking sequence that could be of use in future videos
god the spiderman and chief looks so fucking good - i guess the internal shaders are fuckign awesome but those animations and shit.. god i need a nextgen gmod
#4 on gaming trending you are truly the #1 shitposter!
I didn't know badge was married. The fuck
thats honestly probably the best spiderman ive ever seen
“Committing genocide brings everything to zero not just the employment rate” 10/10 lmfaoo
3:55 nice card now show us the back
As funny as it may be, why are you playing a shitty EA game? You're just helping the shitty company.
I would take out three mortgages to see that movie!!
Ahhh I love the best videos when they appear once every decade. See y'all in another 10 years.
terminator roleplay on gmod is worth it check it out
Jk ima scream at you
HES BACK
Nice lunch
Day 4 of asking badger to play team fortress 2
Make a insurgency sandstorm video
You better not have fuckin 5000 sponsors
Yo badgers married???
Your gonna bring back this game thank you
Don’t worry, Badger. The game no longer has the invincibility hack. Trust me, E.A has finally fixed the problem.
Who here knew badger was married?
EA… what a shame.
This video made me laugh so hard I chocked on my food and had to get emergency Heimlich maneuvered
The only YouTuber that I don't skip through the sponsor section because he just delivers it so good
“We screwed up the Star Wars universe” *Strom trooper hittin a fat vape* “Allow me to introduce the sequels”
If they ever make a DC movie with plastic man in it, Badger should audition
If you really want to play a broken game go play Titanfall 2
Flametrowmer
What if badger played ark 👀👀 by the way guacamole gamer fart 9000 is amazing y’all should try it
Yeah, they're right, we can absolutely eliminate unemployment entirely if we all just fucking glass a planet
Now you probably have never herd of kyber
Just gonna keep hammering it till ya tell me to shutup, I think you and your crew would do well in Star Citizen, Especially with the next freeflight just around the corner.  Yes I absolutely want to get merked to fart.wav
I know this is sad but the highlight of my existence is when badger uploads
best videos come from the russianbadger
Badgur next time could you root the subtitles please? I love the vids but the movement kinda gives me a headache.
"I haven't touched the rum yet" should have guessed that would be Digi
How to sound like Russian badger : "omg I can't believe spiderman from the 90s spiderman TV show from the 90s beat up Master chief from the halo 3 game dlc!!"
Wait badger is married
Ughhhh badgers use of old game menus sound effects gives me a semi, be it MW2 sounds or in this case BF II 2005 its just the best..
Badger even makes sponsorships entertaining
hes married??
"Me and the hommies ruining the Star Wars Franchise" Disney already beat you too it! 😁
I really want to see russian badger make a shitpost out of arma 3
death troopers op lmao i slaughter kids with them

Yo bro where’s ur halo infinite video
FYI there are custom servers that were modded into the game that allows a person to create a server with custom rules and mods built in
Every person with a flamethrower in Star Wars yelling at Jedi saying parry this you filthy wizard
I stand behind Alec Baldwin cuz there's no way in hell I'm standing in front of him
another video another thousand brain cells gone
Honestly had no idea badger was married. Unless that’s a joke that flew over my head.
Ight. Now play the OG 2005 Battlefrot 2
This is 100% funny juice
POG NEW VID
we plan to cut all homeless people in half by 2023 6:56
this is the first video I've seen of you channel and it couldn't be better
Chuck E. Cheese? Naw.. Salacious B. Crumb.
Ngl all the Jet Troopers shoulda gotten the rework that the First Order got
Props to that Kylo Ren who _instantly_ jumped at the opportunity to make Rey into barbecue. "Oh, hello, flametrooper. *Let me assist you."*
This humor is based
Green Goblin: It’s too late Spider-man! Weed has been legalized! Spider-man: But the only one getting smoked is YOU Gobby! *pulls out lightsaber*
idk what the fuck did I just fucking watched but it gave me cancer, so I don't mind
Can you play tf2?
i took a puff a too many more takes... i cant stop chocking
"You can't glass a fucking planet and say 'I did it because it solved the unemployment problem'"  You can do it if you say "I did it because the economy needed it" though
Bagger is best tuber this side of the Mississippi
What happened to rainbow six siege?
Thank you lord, I’ve been waiting for so long
Here's why I LOVE your channel: You just have fun with games as it should be!
I managed to catch a bit of the SW battle front 2 stream a while ago and i was laughing my ass of for almost all of it, needless to say this video is quality
Feels weird being in time for an upload
Based First Order: (Hires/Enlists more women to pay them less)
bro why is Idaho not legalized yet.
Watashi no mai wa Peter Parker....Spider Man
If I had to choose between Badger and my sanity I’d snsksnndndndnndnd
Bro badger your joke are so funny that I can't stop laughing
I love this channel.
The Cringe Strikes Back The Empire Cringes Back
Battlefront 2 is currently experencing what Team Fortress 2 has been for 4 years. Abandoned yet people keep playing it.
Gregory, new badger video.. you must watch it now
play the kyber modded servers they are separate from ea and have some crazy mods like new characters.
“Badger didn’t you die in 2006?”  No.  Only his humor did.
i would dlove to see you guys play scp secret laboratory !
EA: Now that we've gracefully ended the lifecycle for Battlefront II (2) we can take what we've learned and refocus our talent on making Battlefield: 2042 a huge success from launch!
based
man the next star wars movie be looking pretty based right now, i didn't know Badger made trailers for the movies and for some reason its like 17 minutes long
YEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!
My favorite coolaid jammer is chugjug
Kool aid jammer
1:04  what does the runic language thing means on the bottom of the video?
yavin 4 was also a vacation planet so jobs opened up all over the galaxy
Tf2 vid 👀
Learned about Ruby Ridge just so I could get the ATF jokes 😂
bananakin
I hate when this video is below Aphmau and SSundue in Trending
"The majority of the classes feel like they're shooting blank rounds out of fank weapons, And the class shooting back at you is packing heat like Alec Baldwin "   OH MY DEAR LORD THAT IS SO WRONG LMAOOOOOO
Baggur really pullin quotes from republic commando. Fokkin legend
I can’t believe I took down Master Chief. I had such a blast playing with y’all that night and I feel blessed to be part of this community.
“You can’t say you only blew up a planet to drop the unemployment rate to 0”  Hitler: *sweating intensifies
Wait Badger is married
I tap a video and get bananakin… this is a good day 😂
I swear to god badger and his friends are some of the funniest people on YouTube right now
I ain’t beat that case bitch I did the race
Sucks that I only get one episode a month. But worth the wait.
is thgerussianbadger actually a russian and/or a badger?
The one man unit of badger
"You cant just glass a planet and say 'I did because it solved the unemployment problem'" "You're just upset at my outside the box thinking" I fucking love this content
Fans have made Private Servers..........just so you know. Maybe that helps, badger
BANANAKIN
how did you get in working servers? genuine question
Next episode he finds out what the kyber client is and no longer has to worry about any of the hacked lobbies or getting banned by ea for modding.
Badg, you never fail to make me KEKLMAO
i was worry that this day will come once i saw this on twitch
Seeing Badger and friends play Battlefront 2 is like rereading Tag and Bink
Ok, you're just teasing us now. Give us the goddamn tf2 video or I will force you to chug a gallon of BONK! Atomic Punch
I die of fucking laughter every time I watch a new video of this man.
Man Halo Infinite lookin mad different
Oh God
13:14 I was hoping he would sing some of the song
There has never been a single Badger video that wasn't enjoyable from start to finish, and each time it only gets better
immortality issue? just push them off the points with the repulsor!
I died in 1996, but that doesn't matter, what does matter is that I'm a deathtrooper.
Badger and the rest of the crew are proof that damn near any game is fun with friends.
A little off topic but badger, I gotta know. What you think about trudeau vs the truckers?
You know life is good when YouTube's feed hooks you up with Never Gonna Give You Up & a Badger video back-to-back.
Any chance you going to do a video about Halo Infinite?
I just found out my grandfather has cancer today and your video turned my entire day around. Thank you badger your fuckin amazing
Badger saw one tweet and started a new video
I want more of this. This isn't a request. I *NEED* more of this. Give me more funny vivi heheheee
3 seconds in and someone's already source blasted across a map. Yep this is going to be good.
I'm at BLC seeing this shit and Badger has me thinking Heavenly would call it burrito chili lasagna.
When the world needed him the most. He came back
use kyber
Time for yet another dose of monthly Russian Badger!
Banakin Skywalker
good news it’s fix
I can imagine Badger in his Mocap suit 1 day recording Mocap footage for a future video, him going up to the fridge to grab a drink and he just uses that Mocap footage in one of his videos... just for pure shits and giggles. Watching a walking Infected alien head thing from Half life opening the fridge to drink beer or whatever the fuck in the background
Next Battlefront video: playing the squadron maps with aircraft.
Is the graphics better or something? It just looks better.
I love how Heavenly becomes Freddy because he says Gregory and sealed his fate
How did I not know about slishious b crumb. Thank you for enlightenment
“Prank em Alec”
I got off work and noticed this upload and oh my God what a gift thanks badger
Red Faction Guerilla next PLEASE!
Get TheRussianBadger on dying light 2 rn bruh
Yoo Badger either dice or EA are making a fix for the 1hp bug, it was confirmed by management on a battlefield 2042 forum of all things, you don't have to but if you want Russian Badger give this a like or copy and paste this comment
Based
We need to know now if badger uses the cringe Skippy peanut butter or the based jif
Badger is the only YouTuber where I actually watch his sponsorships and pay attention
Can we get a hell let loose video
Why did i expected "peanut butter jelly time" from Bananawalker? XD
I can’t tell you how long I’ve been waiting for this
lmao i straight up thought this was an old video
Skullker sounding a bit normal ever since his soundboard turned his PC into an oven
Made my day, thanks king.
<new Russian badger video <5 seconds in indecipherable <"f*** yeah"
2:10 bananakin skywalker
tf2 oh god, i'm so scared if he actually makes a video on it
based
Hopefully this won't get age restricted like the last one lol
Another video about a game i dont care about, but somehow now wanna buy!? Holy shit badger, ur content always makes me laugh.☺️
The kool aid jammer trooper has to watch out for fin though
You are one of the only creators I know where your content is somehow getting better over time rather than the other way around like most YouTubers. Fucken amazing
8:44 That's an oof right there😂
This man just buffed my serotonin production.
I think i was ingame with ya at some point.
This video was entirely too short, DIRECTOR'S CUT WHEN  In all seriousness, this is some of your best content, Badger, seriously bro. Keep that shit up, man.
The ultimate mod you should have used: lego character models
Aw hell yea
Its like spaceballs 2
i love your shitposts, keep up the good work
6:24 0% UNEMPLOYMENT
IM HERE EARLY
You literally couldn’t do any more damage than Disney and EA has done to this Franchise.
Once you get used to the imbalance somehow you can end up using it to defeat troops stronger than yours, it's wierd, I love it
SHIT IM LATE FOR 4 HOURS IM SORRY :C
"Today is a good day!" - The soldier, from Team Fortress 2.
i simp for badger
If I could like more than once. I would.
599 vids… you are quality and quantity
Never in my 19 years would I imagine seeing a clone commando witness Kirby drop Darth Maul.
I truly appreciate the level of editing and love that’s put into these videos, especially with the sheer amount of utterly trash content out there.
Why is that outro so damn good, I mean, it has no reason to be that good, and it is!
shouldve been sponsored buy the shirt tbh
2 minutes in and i was already laughing
Every time he changes the camera angle it makes the original bf2 main menu noises- oh, the sweet nostalgia
I’ve spelt badjer wrong as a joke so many times that I forget how to spell it. Badgor help
I've heard that weed has been legalized joke before
I tune into this stream and the first thing I hear is tarebear is no longer a wifi bandit rip
I have a question? Does badger animate every character? even the ones in the background doing nothing but stand?
Yet another quality video
When’s the next stream in twitch?
As a professional video editor; yes, you need ALL of the damned cameras!
9:07 "1v1 me on rust"
I want a mod that just makes the sith troopers the koolaid man
That last sub war almost made heavenly drop badger's IP address in chat. Things got scary.
I watch this guy so much I am a mini him. I am a walking crappost. I can also describe anything with based and cringe so like
Bananakin Skywalker
Badger, you've made me wonder if you just want to bodyswap with SB Crumb, wtf
Should put them lower poly avatars from the old battlefront franchise but with even lower poly just to piss everyone off
My phone crashed at 1:46
the legend we need is back with more comedy
Someone needs to mod their whole squadron but just make all the characters eyes 50% more big and yellow
Yall should play TF2 just for stupidity XD
Yoooooooo
EA is actually working on fixing the bug.
dude i just installed battlefront2
This video is gonna get glassed by youtube, like the empire did to alderaan
2:15 Bananakin Skywalker.
I love watching every single one of your videos. Ever since I found your bf3 and bf4 videos all the way up till present day. can't wait to see what you will bring us next badger, also I swear to God if you don't do a damn q&a at some point I'll do somthing...not sure but somthing. So watch out
Im so happy Russian Badger exists

Badger and heavenly should play it takes 2
Badger's married?  Badass
Tbh I didn’t know Badger is married
wait is badger married?
Fuck yeah, new battlefront II video.
I waited this long for this? This was almost as disappointing as my birth
Yo, Badger is Married?  How did i miss this?
Wait wait wait. Hol’up y’all can’t deposit a cheque by taking a picture of it. I’ve been able to do that for a decade now
lol I remember when Nexon was "ok" with texture visual mods on guns on combat arms... then people realized how you could utterly destroy the game by modding other files. Modding the game was almost better than hacking
I want a bagle mabye I should put it in gamer sups
Woo let’s go brain dead part 2
Are you doing this animation by SFM, GMOD or else? :0
You are a mad lad! Legend! Keep it up 👍
Nice video
Dude the only time tf2 seems more cared than this lol
BANANAKIN!
HE'S FINALLY BACK
banakin

Bananakin Potassiwalker

I amazed and lost. Congrats
Please, for the love of GOD please make TEAM FORTRESS 2 content.
Are we just gonna ignore that Badger is married?             *YES*
5:53 With how Episodes 7, 8 and 9 played out, that would've been better hahaha
smrg
ayo jackbox would be so fun to watch
Badger: "You can't glass a planet and then say you did it to solve the unemployment problem"  Every Stellaris player: "Hey man, the lag was getting unreal! Gimme a break!"
I saw the stream like a month ago
GUYS GUYS WAKE UP! THERUSSIANBADGER POSTED!
Tbh "Star Wars: a new cope" sounds better as a title
when i see your notification my day gets 1000% better thanks for doing what you do
HOLY SHIT
The first time I played this game which was around a month ago, I got that hacked server issue with immortality, my dumbass thought it was a warmup mechanic or some shit.
YES! More battlefront 2!
When the world needed him the most  He returned
Thanks to this video I now how to solve unemployment when I become president someday
Hol up, badger married?
play titanfall 2 and i will do literally nothing.
But like, did he ever remember what he was gonna say?
In the hacked servers I resort to meleeing people out of the capture zones and honestly to me it's fun.
3:38 all great purchases
Anyone else think badger and the boys playing dead by daylight custom games would be an actual riot of funny
Never knew Bage was married til now
Badger is the best YouTuber by far
comment for algorithm
how yall feel about green beans
Yesss! I've been waiting for a new video
The unemployment jokes made me choke on my fruit salad.
green Armour super soldier monkey man is in the wrong movie franchise. cant wait to see master chief fix unemployment with a planet destroying laser.
Clearly you haven't gone on a 40 streak with a Jet Trooper.
pog
De pUt MaSeR ChIf in DeR BaTtleFruNt
This is too cringe that it's BASED.
Ive been telling badger to mod Battle Front 2 for now since 2 years ago..... BRO WHAT!!!!
it would be funny as hell to se Palpatine as Spider-Man with that waddle of his lmao!
I present to you the goat youtuber TheRussianBadger
Can’t wait to see a bunch of goobs on the russianbadger wavelength flood into Battlefront 2
real question tho how did you get any footage with how many hackers have ruined the game?
Close commander goated ngl 20 killstreak type
Badger, coming back at it again with not 1, not 2, but **3** BATTLEFRONT II vid's it simply can't be done! ITS NOT POSSIBLE!
2:27 they put the mamsnrhbr chehfde in the ster wersh
Wait is badger actually married
We are missing Motherfucken Doomguy
Yo bananakin is my favorite character
Alright folks, lets see how long his alien monkey obsession is gonna last
Badger you have to make a TF2 video at this point, the references are killing me
Yo try playing Han with the tackle that can literally bring down Vader.
Can I inject this man's videos directly into my gamersupps and imbibe it by the gallon?
HE USED THE SCORCH VOICE LINE LETS GOOOOOO
Surprised no at st looked like bt You should try deep rock galactic a game where you are a dwarf sent to a planet to steal all the natural resources while killing millions of the inhabitants trying to stop you.
4:37 is badger wearing make-up  ?
If you think that the sith trooper is fun, just pick the right combo of star cards for Iden versio on empire and you’ll be beaming and obliterating everybody
Can you cover tf2
New content fuck yeah
Badger you should play a game like warframe or destiny next, if your gonna be branching into MMOs
badger you should play tf2 after making so many references to it
Bruh, i was just saying, its February where vid, i go and take a shower and this filth is infront of me
You know i was eatin that Spicy Lovers pizza from Pizza Hut while watching this banger
fuck EA and their inability to allow more funni mods
Hey, gamer break up your videos please!   So we can SKIP your dated ads.
Dude you should play and mod Half-Life: Alyx you can do some funny things
Gotta say, genuine critisism, not your finest work, still like top 10% of content on youtube, and still great content as always, but kinda feels like lower quality than your other recent vids. Still great content tho :D
kirby just clapped mauls cheeks is funny however the fallout new vegas video where he lost karma for killing house then said "why did i lose karma he is a vegetable im just making him mashed potatoes" is still my favorite quote
havent watched your content since bf3/bf4.... jesus crist, what have you become!??!?
I love this man’s contend like holy shit I can’t stop laughing🤣
Current flows, I don’t know we’re it goes.
I feel its illegal to be watching a video within 12h of it coming out
Waif reveal
Moaaaar!!!
Less go new vid
"packing heat like alec baldwin" badger your going to hell🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How the fuck do you know that the shriveled fetus of a rat monkey has the name salacious crumb
Spiderman: A Galaxy From Home is already out?
"I glassed the planet to solve the unemployment" That's just the plot of Metal Gear Rising a little more extreme
Yeah Badger would know the name of that damn monkey lizard, NERD!
Badger I have a sponsor and don't need to worry about monetization. *Cracks open a cold one* So Alec Baldwin...
🗿
Badger really don't lie. With throwing verbal shitposting with the homies into the mix, how can a game be this cringe yet be so based?
“Welcome back to me and the homies ruin the Star Wars franchise!” Nonono _Disney_ ruined Star Wars.  You made it fun again.
Fucking 5 min intro. Are you fucking with us now or something?
DO BATTLEFRONT 1!!!
I finally realized Who badger looks like. He looks like the superman actor from Batman v superman
Im very convinced he’s sponsored by all the games he plays
Your videos are just top tier every time.
13:43 POV: You're any nameless goon in a Marvel Spiderman movie/comic/game
I take that back I still like your channel but the game is good with and without mods
I shit u not, I literally asked myself yesterday when badger was dropping this video and it came out the next day. It made me scream
WE BAAAACK
TheRussianBadger salacious b crumb simp confirmed
damn badgers hand swerve and point lmao
Idk Badger but Supercharged or Explosive Sentry for Heavy bullies heroes
13:05 Is this a voice line from something or what? It almost sounds like Burnie Burns
Yes how long i have waited for this brother
Get current. Just do it... Cries in European.
Im still holding out for the hope that, if this video is popular enough, EA will send a small team to fix the invincibility thing
BANANAKIN SLIPWALKER
Yessessssssssssssss rip i missed the stream tho
Homeboy needs a keeps sponsor lol
Salacious B. Crumb is next level
Can't have nothing good in the cis
"I AM A BANANA!"  *Random Vacuum Cleaner Sounds*
this slaped
If you learned 1 thing in this video it's salacious crumb
Everytime I see a republic commando… I cry, I cry every time.   I really want a sequel to the game, or a live action series 😭
anybody translated the mandoa at the bottom of the screen here 0:36 I don't wanna but I will when I get bored this weekend maybe
Badger I liked your channel until you did this
They put mastechif in the batlefront
Badger shall be "GOAT" *BASS BOOSTED*
You NEED to try Arma 3 starwars mods. Like a single starsim op with the amount of cursed would be gold.
to be completely honest.. didn’t know badger was married and i’ve been watching him for 5 years.. lmfao
Have a good day badger and the crew!
One of the very few YouTubers for whom I actually use notification bell
Why
Not "The Cringepire Strikes Back?" or "Attack of the Cringe?" Come on Badger, just hire me to make dad jokes in your titles already.
Oh no
The Jetpack Trooper is just Ronnie Lott.
Yeah, current seems ver good but I'm European
That endcard was awesome!
Day one of asking the Russian badger to let me join the discord for a video
are you gonna put siege on this channel again someday?
Let’s fucking goooooo Russian badger finally uploads
holy shit i though you would never post star wars battlefront 2 again
Broke game is broke
Play siege again
I know you guys love Battlefront, but have you ever considered, seeing as it's on its 10-year anniversary, The Old Republic?
Omg this was the best fucking thing
0:19 wrong he deserves the whole clip
MOM, RUSSIAN BADGER POSTED A VID
0:21 but your the one getting smoked gobby. 🔥🔫
Vietnam is still undefeated
I just started the vid and I only can say “I have a bad feeling about this”
love the jokes and mods they are super cool and yeah
DEY PUT DA MAHMSTER CHEEF IN DE BETTLEFRUHNT.
Personally I use the first order jet trooper as a mobile artillery unit  The secondary fire you can eat that shit from one side of the map to the other
Ah yes Bananakin Skywalker
Bro how much weed did you smoke before that debit card commercial? Your eyes are cut
“Packing heat like Alec Baldwin” Man is testing the demonstration button
Bananakin 🤣 😂😂😂
Wait is badger actually married?  Nice
Pls Do Far Cry 6
"One of the most protected franchises on the planet." With Kathleen Kennedy still employed, I don't know about that one, chief.
YEAH
You should do TF2
How did I almost miss this gem
Playing as death trooper is just waiting to be like “middle ability iiiiis now” and then hun down every unfortunate soul who came into sight range.
Bananakin Skywalker
Bananakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Cornoby.
If the squad eventually plays Deep Rock Galactic, that's probably going to be one of the funniest videos possible.
how did you kill people
13:47 when did badger become bender from futurama.
Badger just goes to sleep for like 4 to 6 months when he wakes up he shits us out a video
Is this how it feels to be schizophrenic?
The flametrooper is basically pyro from tf2 before jungle inferno
play more ready or not pls
Hey badger. You convinced me to get both left4dead games. Love it!
video pog, u cool.
bf2 is so fun, truly wish EA didnt give up on it, also looks like from a recent interview they are not working on BF3 and are instead focusing on 2042, big ol L
That steam had me rolling at work that evening!🤣🤣🤣
This video came out while I was playing battlefront 2
Wait .. Did badger use mando'a in those transitions?
There is a Kyber server which has stuff like private servers and other things like that made by a modding community
"the unemployment rate drops to zero when you commit a genocide"   Minutes from the Nazi meetings on economic recovery 1933"
Mass genocide pog world hunger fixed
I love to see Kirby flying across a room to give badger a skin fade.
See y’all in 4 months
The return of the king
This video felt like i watched the whole avengers series if it were on a budget😂
TF2 Vid when
The "no" from heavenly as glamrock freddy fits too well
I made food and put it into the microwave I press the buttons and I click start and we just hit the part we're rey is killed 6:08 I hear the beats and I look back on my camera my food is going what the f*** was that and I watch the video I'm like oh I was the video
It's just battlefield one
Badger when TF2 video
I broke my arm but this turned my day into a good one.
WOOOO NEW VIIIIID
I’ve waited all of january
Thanos: *_*snaps his fingers in Infinity War*_* Pregnant Women: 1:02
Ah the Vietnam flashbacks
"Ice cube sandwiches" Oooo, look at the millionaire who can afford bread!
Bro this is some funny stuff.
Is there anywhere to watch him just play the game? No offense I love his content but I'd much rather watch him play the game for a little bit with friends rather watch him describe a game spinning in circles for 20 minutes
I LIKE YOUR SHOES!
Who da fuk is this salvation p bum???
This is my first time seeing this channel, but I subscribed two minutes in! The rapid fire jokes and mocap animation reminds me so much of Xavier Renegade Angel lmao
My Day was ruined but not anymore
Ayo, I think he could do the same with Payday 2
I only play on BF2 on Xbox, I had no idea that Pc servers had so many hackers, it’s harder to for people to hack entire servers on Xbox and makes the game fun with friends and beating up tryhards
I’m starting to think this guy likes Salacious Crumb
8:29 sounds familiar, like I've heard this story somewhere. I think it rhymes with Chitin Ball
I'm SOO glad Badger did another video of this! His other video is my literal favorite!
In case you didn't know, Badger, but private servers were modded into the game (with other mods available to be played in those servers), so you could play on those.  (side-note, the private servers are not affected by the hacks) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Ke8z9jIwM [This video explains it]
Badger wtf is your upload schedule I’ve seen all of your videos while waiting for this one
Those alec baldwin jokes broke me bro
BADGER HAS A WIFE???
I ain't got no friends like this they all play cringe shit and don't watch star wars  I have this game on PC and PS4 tho, even though I don't have people to play with :/
Waiting for the day Badger uploads a video about the ATF shooting his dog for having an FRT.
Oh yeah! A new Badger vid!
y'all would love to fuck around on Starwars Gmod RP. To punch a shock trooper.
Holy shit
Yyeess more battlefront!!!!
I got a game that I think you and the groupe would love : Deep Rock Galactica. The game is pure chaos and has a great comunity and could lead to some great and funny videos that I know you can make and that you provide us with . Thank you for listening to my TED talk.
Lets fucking gooooooooooooo
is anyone else just learning that badger has a wife? damn miracles can happen in the 21st century
The USA on 1945 be like: *would you look at that hiroshima and nagasaki have 0% unemployment rate*
Is it just me who thought the "Your behavior frightens and confuses me sir" sounded exactly like Moxie from Helluva Boss 13:06
Wait Badger is married 😳?  If I'm wrong who is married?
Badger have you tried doing left 4 dead custom maps. I think that would be great with the warped version of the game you play.
Yooooo comment “creamed” if you see this
I just finish a round of co-op on battlefront and saw this on my phone.
10:30 Luigi gets glassed
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
you do know there is private matches for bf2 on pc
Let’s play the game: which pair of glasses is badger actually looking through
I was literally looking for something to watch, great video I'm sure. Time to settle in and enjoy.
Yo it's soviet badger from fortnite.
Keep the awesome videos coming Badger, love your content man
Moar bagel
Look a Russian badger video. Mind if I do
wife reveal. i don' believe it chief
man alll these tf2 references but no tf2 vids come on badger do some tf2
I think there's modded servers that has way more content called Kyber I think
Alpha Chad gaming
Literally the minute a Fortnite joke dropped in this video, Bruno Mars releases as a skin in Fortnite.
Dustin and Pasta be like: If we blow up a planet, we not only solve the unemployment problem but also world hunger and poverty
FartNickle
Probably the biggest shock is hearing that badger has a wife
I hate how the shitpost tasted the best out of the free gamer sups samples.....*sigh* fine you can take my money
Wait badger just released another video? Hah guess ill call in sick this is more important than bread 😂
Speaking of abandoned game,when are you gonna make a tf2 video?
Rewatched the stream a few times and was really hoping prank em alex got into the video. Hype
Man within 2 hours you get demonitized f in the chat
Literally just hearing Scorch say “Your tactics confuse and frighten me sir,” put such a happy smile on my face, I’m so glad that got in the video
i was here
The stream for this video was so good
Uses all of that 5k like
Im reinstalling
MAKE A TEAM F 2 VID PLZ
This video made me come back to battlefront 2….. ugh
E
Did you use homey to buy all that
You know there is kyber servers that allows you to use more... Extreme kind of mods
"roasting bad guys"  With a clip of a burning rebel. Glad to see Badger is a cultured individual.
13:13 I never said “u can’t even get in” any faster in my life
Honey wake up, new RussiaBadger upload
Wait... is Badger married? I'm being completely serious here I only really watch on youtube and haven't seen anything about this so I'm not sure.
Well you guys didnt ruin the franchise. Kathleen Kennedy did that. She wiped her ass with lore and story, to pander to SJW's
I only liked the video when i saw scout trooper shufflin in the end of the vid, stellar stuff.
This sucks
Play extraction
I want a Star Wars squad game where all the troopers in the squad are just badger and his friends the entire game
absolutely cancerously funny
Nostaliga.
Yeah back when I played the game and the jet troopers for the fo where introduced, I went on absolute genocides with them
Your motion capture stuff reminds me of Deadpool!
11:05 WHO DID THEY TURN INTO AN OPEN FIRE ROAST!?!? XD
Never would’ve expected a battlefront video after like 50 years
Benefits of blowing up an inhabited planet:  Unemployment goes down No more climate issues No more cross planet alimony to your ex-wife that moved there  Downsides of blowing up an inhabited planet: Genocide is committed  Millions of lives and cultures are lost The trigger man most like is consumed by guilt and is probably going to hell for being told to press a button.
Do halo next
the ragdolls in the animation honestly was my favorite part of this video
Badger, you are a gift from God.
I’m waiting for Salacious B Crumb to return in Book of Boba Fett
According to Disney if you go to the galaxy edge park you are cannon in starwars
Now this is content
Nice VID
7:00 That's straight up the US Economy in 2022
Watching Badger play this game like a damn monkey makes me feel some type of way
If we don't get more crumb in the next battlefront video im going to riot
I really gotta try getting high before entering one of your vids just to see how hard it would hit if there's no holding back
Dude the hum and the boom on the sith trooper's laser is just, godDAMN
Amazing
Soon enough, our entire observable universe in all its existence will canonically be part of the fortnite cinematic universe.
I think badger is getting old not gonna lie
PLEASE revisit apex legends on season 12, it looks crazy
5:40 BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD.
Yay another vid
Last thing I’d expect badger to be sponsored by is a bank, while making bank
Can we get a movie
Badger and friends playing TF2 when?
HINNGA WAIF? got me dying love the content badger love it 😂
Bro, the way badger said “It’s Spider-Man!” Is like every damn Spider-Man video game she. You’re doing a stealth mission before the PS4 games
truly the definition of comedic
Speaking of games that are broken and completely abandoned by its developer but are still fun as all hell, you should do a video on team fortress 2. I think it’d do great and this poor decrepit game need a little bit of love from a larger creator like you. Plus you already use a bunch of it’s effects in your (amazing) animations, and I think a tf2 video in your format would be funny as hell.
rest of new vegas dlc when
I almost choked on my ramen when I saw Skywalker as a banana. XD
I hate when these vids end now I don’t know what to watch😭
Ironically, when badger said that weed has been legalized, my computer straight up crashed
This video came out as soon as i made my GSupps. Perfect timing
YES ITS HERE
I'm a simple man, I see Russian badger, I drop everything and consume content.  Don't even care if I have engineering hw due tonight, I gotta set them priorities 😤
Me: cannot physically breathe because of sickness  Badger: posts video  Me: instantaneously cured so I can laugh
Fun fact badger battlefield 1 now has more players in online multiplayer than 2042 does
play for honor
Man you should try Kyber custom servers
dis dood takes months to make videos but hell da bideos are so good
It’s badger time
Dawn of war video plz
make a tf2 video
You kidding me? Heavenly was the one who made the slave joke, you should not have gotten dmc’d for that. I mean, an African American said it…Right?  Sorry fo that’s offensive, I just thought it’s okay for Them to make the one kinds of jokes.
He got married?!?!? To who?
person named mischief IS SPITTING STRAIGT FACTS THO
Badger, Battlefront 2 has private servers now with a thing called Kyber if you wanna try any mods (any gameplay changing mods you can use there, literally adding in new units like Magna Guards or Clone Engineer with a shotgun or heroes and villains like  Jango Fett and Ahsoka as well as a shit ton of new weapons with a gameplay rework) and play with friends and viewers without the 1hp bug (which apparently is actually getting fixed for EA servers as well).
Wonder if he's gonna make a r6 extraction vid
Honestly, most fun I ever had was 4 man defense against ai. I think it was jabba's palace and we got to last defense and like every 2 minutes was a new wave on omaha beach. We had death troopers, DLT-19s and miniguns but AI was deadset on their objective XD
Tf2 vid now bithch
What is the purpose of this video please i dont getit
so are you still playing battlefield?
Did Badger drop a Scorch from Republic Commando voice line, or was that just me?
Now everyone can say badger’s room is littered with crumbs
The empire strikes crack
Bro… wait till they find out about custom servers… no glitches, ban hackers, and INSTALL MODS THAT BREAK THE GAME. Perfection at its finest
Imagine face of usual trooper when he sees Bananakin fighting Mirby with a 'nanasaber
bro, these models look better every time
Has badger done a tf2 video?
If you use Kyber you can use gameplay modifications, more than just cosmetic mods
Spyduh mann
wait a second. doesn't bf2 on pc have the 1hp glitch? ya know its preatty broken at the moment??
Cant wait for the Noble 6 mod, just so you really know you lose
Are you ever going to play Rainbow again
please do a tf2 video!!! so much potential in that
the sith trooper is just the adidas stormtrooper
Am I the only one that hears "Heavenly, are you okay?" in the background at 9:15? Either that or all of the mods have melted my brain.
uploaded this the day i started playing it again and getting countless crashes and blue screens pls stop making my pain worse
now review Star Wars Kotor 1 and 2.
“Alex Baldwin? Bad taste? Too soon?? Shit do it anyways” -Badger (probably)
Hey why didn’t you play saw or play starship mode
What if Deadpool had a YouTube account
There's another abandoned EA game that recently received mods called titanfall 2 oh and another thing it's on source. Just one thing don't forget to install the 3rd party client that lets you actually play the game.
“BANAKIN IS NOT AFRAID OF YOUR LASERS”
I love the sith troopers, me and a buddy abused the sith troopers hard when they first dropped it
Asking for an infinite video until it happens: attempt 2
I was like “i haven’t seen this one yet” then saw it was 2 hours ago
eating your content
Ever since the first Battlefront video, I have been Anti-Ewok. I'll be willing to run a build-a-bear lookin' ass pillow case's fade in a HEARTBEAT.
Hey I made that Spider-Man mod 😳
I love picturing badger doing that litle ending dance in his mocap suit and then all of a sudden his wife walks in and he just stands there looking at her until she backs away slowly
Who is still waiting another Payday 2 video?
been eagerly waiting for the next one
all those subs that stream
Once, maybe twice a month videos. But the HIGHEST quality bullshit I have ever seen.
I've been waiting
anyone who has tried to play this game in the last 10 months knows that this game is dead legit 2+ hour wait times
HE DON'T MISS  Another video proving Badger is in fact Ballin.
I was just playing this it yesterday, had a blast
Yeas
0:23  Me, watching this while high in an illegal state: "You cowards will never stop me."
Barrel did not deserve that
Please do another fallout playthrough
I was there when the sub wars was going on there were so many
Putting Rey in a microwave, glassing a planet to solve unemployment, Alec Baldwin jokes, all those were great but Pov: when you sell an 8th in NY fucking killed me.
Waiting for this to be age restricted too 😂
Can you do a video about ULTRAKILL from NewBlood? Just asking, if no then no.
WOOO MORE BATTLEFRONT
Hey can you please post more r6 siege plz I feel so lost in the new seasons with out your videos
Play the custom lobby mod recently added to the game please, it would be funny.
Damn it's been a month already?
Bajur got dat currentcy
Oh god...he has access to fnaf models
Wait a fucking minute badger actually married his gf?? Damn congrats dude
Badger is married?!
I watched the stream and I’ve been waiting for the vid and I register watching the stream also are you gonna play enlisted again?
Hehe you should try a game call For Honor
Titanfall 2 Northstar mod plz thx
Personally I think the current credit card sponsorship is the worst sponsorship you've taken and pretty much the worst sponsorship any YouTuber I've watched taken I still love your videos and not changes my feelings towards you I just highly dislike the choice and sponsorship
How did you manage to get content with the bug in most servers that prevented kills from happening?
BADGER'S MARRIED!?
Bossk shoulda been Green Goblin bruh
I am commenting this as the very beginning. I really hope there is a lot of ewok
“You deserve a bullet” from Fortnite
5:36 How any of the sequel trilogy movies should have ended.
You are getting demonitzed
rey got flammenwerfed. so sad.
Okay hear me out  You put TF2 sound effects and characters and graphics in your videos all the time... why not have a TF2 episode? That's what I've wanted to see for ages.
Yo badger you gotta play black ops two
I know when I need credit card advice, I look to the one I trust the most, TheRussianBadger
In all seriousness I love these videos.  They remind me of days gone by with the friends I lost and I get a similar feeling when I watch a new video on basically any topic.  Thank you Badger for making these videos.  They always make my day.
It is real pay to win hours
Bing was about to destroy everything at the end
Quote "Life...uuh...life finds a way".
SALACIOUS B. CRUMB GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
That's because the death trooper is so damn op
I bought guacamole gamer fart yesterday. Just waiting for it to come in
Halo infinite video?
I wanna see Dwayne ‘the rock’ Johnson cooking with his Dwayne ‘the Wok’ Johnson while threatening me with his Dwayne ‘the glock’ Johnson hidden by a Dwayne ‘the sock’ Johnson and staring at the Dwayne ‘the clock’ Johnson while dissing the hit pokemon character Dwayne ‘the Brock’ Johnson posting it on Dwayne ‘Tik-Tok’ Johnson and parking his boat in the Dwayne ‘the dock’ Johnson.
Bananakin skywalker
I love the bananakin skywalker skin.
W E E D
All the Rey fans be salty after you turned her into a Hot pocket
Not trying to argue with your criativity but "The  empire cringes back " would be a way better title.
Ayo nah gimme the source to the juju beat at the end i want that for when i meet the all mighty my guy.
Can you do tarkov
Is it me or are you posting faster
HE LIVESSSS
Badgers married? Da frik?
Was badger the YouTuber in Inscryption?
13:15 I literally stopped everything I was doing to reply with "you can't even get in." That song is engraved into me.
Selatious Bread Crumb
Gregory, do you see that Monkey Camel over there?
this mf married? o lawd
DENIED
This needs a p3! This game is gold, and the amount of shitpost that can come from it is amazing!
I never thought i'd say this but Badger got salacious crumb drip.
Selatious Ballin Crumb
Wait badger.. Yor'ue married? TO A WUMAN? CRINGE!!
With every fibre of my being I FUQING LOATHE *Bannanakin Skynannawalker* and it’s creator.
I had NO idea he was married tf
I now believe y’all crew smoke before recording 😂
I hate how realistic the animated portions of badger are getting
you know its a good day when Badger posts and your battery is at 69%
The discord is litty
I would totally love if Badger n' Co played Killing Floor 2. There's so much dumb meme stuff they could do in that game
Come back to bf1 pls...
YOU HAVE A WIFE?!
I don’t care what class you play, nothing is more overpowered than heavy with his explosive sentry. And That’s why he’s my favorite. He is the equalizer.
Glass earth to solve unemployment. Big brain.
Still watching him this man is more than a god
Me, a norwegian watching the sponsored segment, who is used to all that shit being inherent in my banking experience: "That shit's not standard in America? wtf is wrong with your country?"
I don't mind Salacios Crumb but he ain't my favorite. Mine is R2D2
bananikan bananawalker  Lol
USS           R  O  N  A  L  D          M  C  D  O  N  A L  D
"welcome back to me and the homies ruining the star wars franchise" nah I think Disney and EA got you beat on that front bruh
Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing on that ship?
ah yeees  rosham borjor
Yeah go take a nap and drink your gamer guacamole farts so you can fart in bed and smell like guacamole in the morning
and thats around 16 minutes of non stop laughter thank you badger!
WOOOOOO MORE BATTLE FRONT LETS GOO
You need to play Garry’s mod
ayo im in the video
I pray every second of everyday that when I refresh my sub feed that this mans pure unadulterated hardcore dopamine rush is there begging for my eyes to consume every last second of this ungodly precious content.
I hope his content veers away from the funny=random type content and back to his old routes but other than that it’s good.
In B4 age restriction
Always a banger from badgjur
Our lord hath returned praise the all mighty badger
Zanny and Bajur uploading in the same day?? peaked
I feel my brain smoothing
I was just laughing at this while it played in the background then heard something about Badger and Marriage?
Of course the best jedi ever is spider man, don't @ me
You guys needed to play Ewok Hunt it’s so fun
I would watch bad batch if instead of a good unit it was a terrible unit like you idi- geniuses. I would love two seasons of that
We should take what happened to yavin 4 and do it to earth to solve global warming
can we please get a short of you mo-capping the outro
YOOOO HE UPLOADED
Hey Badger, Just a heads up, there is a server that you can setup for mods that's protected from the 1hp Immortality glitch. Its called KYBER
Although I haven't fully watched yet. I disagree with the George Lucas comment. He created Jar Jar and the Christmas special for Starwars. He probably would endorse this it can't be that bad, right?
SPIDER MAN
now we need TF2 2022
They put the mamsnrhbr chefde in the ghame
Mfw badger is just trying to artificially inflate starwars battlefront 2's average server pop by making videos about it
one thing bout the alec baldwin shit HE IS THE PRODUCER!
Me: hey badger who’s your favorite Jedi in Star Wars? Badger: *M A S T E R   C H I E F*
I was there for last stream, the sub train was absolutely bonkers; it was basically those 3 guys fighting each other to see who could gift the most subs and each were up to about 400 in less than 20 minutes
What happened to bf2 is going to happen to bf2042
Yoooo da Badger is back!!! LET'S GOOOO!!!
HE DON'T MISS
Bro I love the TF2 reference I love too soo you guys play that😂😂
I’m a big fan of Star Wars and I publicly support you burning Rey alive with a heavy flame thrower
Man Heavenly really did a 180 on that free Tay-k thing huh?
12:40 all I could think of is Zanny and his friends just going “THEY FLY NOW”
these videos keep getting more elaborate, absolutely love this shit
Try out the Northstar client for Titanfall 2 next.
Badgers WHAT? WIFE?
I remember watching this stream
Oh let's goo Clone Commando is my favourite.
I wonder if emperor palpatine is racist if he only recruits clones,not humans, not aliens but clones of a single person
Those Alec Baldwin jokes hit hard.      About as hard as that bullet
This was such a god damn treat to watch, from start to finish. even when you're SPONSORED you make it absolutely hilarious.  Glad you're taking the time to "Make the best damn video, every single time."
Love the Mando text at the bottom
2 hrs
Force freeze is literally the star wars equivalent to ZA WARUDO TOKI WO TOMARE.
Good shit, none of this short vid stuff shit
Its happened.
Im getting flexed on for not having amazing friends for 16 minutes and 49 seconds
10:48 TF2 players be like
c r i n g e
Badger before Flametropper: Pew Pew, kill yowks (or smt like that i dont write bananas) Badger after Flametrooper: *BE PURGED IN THE HOLY FLAME!*
NICE
I get so happy when I see they badger uploaded a vid bro
Yo badger do team fortress 2  That shit would be hilarious
I wish the top comment was just George Lucas saying “Oh, I know”
turn the current card around so we can see the whole thing
The quality of your videos is so good I can’t stop smiling
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
YES, ANOTHER BATTLEFRONT 2 VIDEO! >:)
Amazing videos as always and does anyone know what editing software he uses?
The Empire: do it do it!!! Come do the dark side   TheRussianBadger: I’m already on the dark dark side, you gotta come join me!!!
you can play on the Kyber servers to not be hacked
AM BRICK.....Not from fortnite, just Brick
yo you ever hit up project cannabis in sf? i always call that place project eden. Love the farcry 5 vid btw
11:41 you never asked badger.
If he thinks the sith trooper's right click is gud wait til he sees the arc trooper
I love your videos so much after a long day
😀
After 6 hours at the airport today, and getting canceled after cancelled.. I just needed a good fucking fun laughter.
Wait. Badger married? The hell am I doing wrong?
We're is a other battlefield 2042 vid
The wait was worth
Play titanfall2
My day has kinda suc- *Badger uploads* THIS DAY IS AMAZING!!!
This is great, i love the content
Bae wake up new badger and zanny videos
The true sequels
I’m not sure this is a good way to test whether my gums have healed from having my wisdom teeth removed
I’m pretty sure there’s a custom server on bf2 that adds a shit ton of weapons that are actually unique
*K I C K S  D O W N D O O R* I have arrived
I can’t believe other people been thinking about mah boi crum mans been living rent free in my head since I was 8
Fantastic.  Darasuum Kote!!
Its always a good day when Bagel uploads
Badger keep up with the videos because you are on fire 😎🙏
Ya love to see more battlefront 2 content. It's not an opinion, it's canon.
2,571oneth
Your hacker problem isn’t that bad there’s another game that EA made and The game got hacked so hard they came in and fix it then it got hacked again the game is gone and the commuting feels like they’ve abandon us for years now and now we taking matters into our own hands. the game is called titanfall2 It came out in 2016
I was able to watch maybe an hour of one of these streams one day and the sheer amount of good stuff Badger has to cut out is astronomical. Great work, my good sir. And maybe tell Heavenly he works a little too well as Glamrock Freddy.
aaaawwwyeaaa BOI. A new video from my main man *BADGE*  hahahaha  I LOVE YOUR CONTENT DUDE, I'VE RE-WATCHED OLDER VIDEOS REPEATEDLY. U da GOAT
you can park the tank on spawns and the other team will load in to being roadkilled
Wait badgers married?
I can say that when badger streams tf2 he will get sooo many free items from fans, i can tell
6:40 as in Stellaris: News: Unemployment Drops To Record Low Following Use Of Planet Cracker
7:59 Good news! This exploit is actually going to be fixed (after 3 months)!
0:48 YOOOOOOO those camera switch sounds are so nostalgic.
That fucking outro made my day
When people are hacking turns out you can run them over with a walker and I will still kill him
badger is married?
make a tf2 vid!
Ily
Jabba prefers you use "indentured servant"
if you get the kyber costom servers mod you can use insane mods that arent just cosmetic  and the mod will also stop the exploit that gives you imortallity
Badger used to work in finan-...I'm sorry, but can you imagine Badger as fucking FINANCIAL ADVISOR!?
I see you with the Republic Commando reference
Why is heavenly built like a bantha
30 seconds In and I liked the vid
I didn’t know he was married 😐
if you want to try battlefront mods without the risk of being banned, i'm pretty sure the old battlefront II can be very modded without that risk
“Everytime we bring up Badger’s wife everybody’s just like *argheghabada waifu*?!?!”    Me: Yo Badger can talk to women? Good for him.
Got good news for ya! They are actually fixing the immortality thing.
I was expecting a battle front 2 video, but not this thing
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry   But fukin Badgers MARRIED damn congrats
"Me and the homies ruining the Star Wars franchise" Disney is way ahead of you on that.
Don't worry badger your content is actually an improvement on star wars vs the Disney bs
Part of me has fun imagining badger in their room doing the mo cap for these videos
LET'S FKING GOOOOOOO!!!!
Well well we'll Bananakin. We meet again...
don't worry, there's nothing you can do that Disney hasn't already done that would make George Lucus upset.
Have you tried the custom servers mod?
I'd watch a Star Wars movie with Badger and his friends arguing about shit at random places as long as it's directed by George Lucas
Another badge video for me to hurt my side with laughter again
Badger worked in finance. That explains a lot.
Yeeeessss another battlefront II video!!!
I am alpharius this is a lie
Once co-op is out please do a video on it 🙏
Thanks Badger for uploading I really needed this.
Wait, Badger married??
It’s the entire Star Wars franchise from fortnite
2:16 bananakin skywalker
I never thought I would see glamrock freddy in a russianbadger video.
You can only make tf2 jokes so much before you actually make a video about it
Bruh awesome
So EA pulled a Valve and BF2 is going the way of TF2.
Badger only posts bangers, ON GOD
Could you do tf2 please because you show so many tf2 meme and jokes about it.
Is the Alzheimer’s thing gonna be a running joke? Makes 2 vids where someone forgot what they gonna say
17 minutes is not enough I need more
Ea said they will be fixing the 1 hp glitch
Ah yes special troops, the dichotomy of basically a hero, and whatever the fuck the rebels have to offer
The arc trooper and the sith troopers secondary fire turns into a homing shot after a certain distance
Yo badger warface. Now has insect's as enemys you should try it
Shit day but come back home to a fresh badger upload?? SIGN ME TF U-
The editing of this video was so nostalgic to me.
The god is back
6:44 badger voice went so damn deep
Let’s fucking go
I’m hoping Badger does another Battlefront II, but modded to the level of Left 4 dead 2
I’ve been waiting for this since the mods where announced
Wait... Is badger married?
Greatest start to February i could ask for.
I fucking love this man and his friends, even when I learn that my mom actually hates my guys, you guys make my day so much better. I wish i could throw money at you xD
Also day 1 of saying zamn until it gets acknowledged
I would love to see these guys play the galactic contention mod on squad. I would piss myself if I heard jello or heavenly with a z6 rotary.
I remember doing something simialr to what yall do with nades back on mw3 to find boosted lobbies. There were some that gave xp for suis, which is crazy
Great
Zamn
1 video every month is normaly bad but with this quality id wait an fucking year
got done playing catch up for my class assignments and the first thing I see is a new RussianBadger video. I'm at peace knowing the rest of my brain cells are going to get fried after this.
My guys surpasses anything expectable to God
bananakin
I came as fast as I could
KEEP MAKING THESE SHITPOSTIN VIDEOS, WE LOVE'EM
Wait badgers married?
I wanna see the graph of people playing this. Like I wanna see it spike up by 150% for 24 hours after these vids are uploaded then crash again after they realise how shit the game is
Hey fucker make a R6 S.I. vid. I MISS WUMBO FUZE
ANOTHER BADGER VID
6:39 oh yeah this is getting demonitized
Badger is truly the shitposting master
Not gonna lie. Goated video, but the Alec Baldwin part was a little rough for me.
I think he likes salashus crumb
My jaw hurts
If you set up private servers you can have whatever mods you want. If you want know how just ask.
This man just flexed the camera so bad lmao I love it
Its a great day!!
Lmao Bananakin Skywalker
The sith trooper alt fire does a motherfucking garand ping sound when it hits. We officially can't go a single video without somebody real or fictitious doing a garand ping...
The Bananasaber
See y'all on trending
Heavenly has become best freddy
this video is complete chaos, i love it
Oh my god. Please play TF2. Now that you have mentioned it’s stuck in my head.
Digital Vagrant has rum? CAPTAIN JACK! THE RUM AINT ALL GONE JUST YET!
Badjur is one of the few people I know that can go "yeah I just want the money fuck you" and everyone would be okay with it without fear of people screeching "he's a money-sucking BASTARD EXECUTE HIM"
Lets Fucking Go!!!!!
No body mentioned the repulser on snipers
BRO HE'S BANANA BRO HE'S BANANA
Bananakin Skywalker
I love how unlike some youtubers who just piggyback on whatever the most popular meme is at the time, Badger and his friends are out here making their own memes with the crazy ass conversations they have with each other, always makes my day to see a new upload 'cause I know I'm in for some shit, lol
The video was good overall, but I lost my SHIT when I heard the Republic Commando line. That brought back some memories I didn't remember I had, and has now forever entwined them in Badger's signature brand of meme-y bullshit. Excellent work, and I look forward to another video on this game in 2023!
For anyone who was curious, the Mandalorian script at the bottom of the screen from 0:35-0:41 is gibberish, it doesn't translate into anything in English or Mando'a. Seems to use some symbols that look like Mandalorian script but aren't actually, for some reason.
i am so glad you enjoy BF2
I love how this community doesn’t give jacksh-t about scammers, good move
That Master Chief montage made my day lol
Mr badge, will you be playing extraction?
But you're the one getting smoked gobby!  *rampant gunfire*
Mandalorian!!!!!!!!
Badgers squad is the terrible mix between the bad batch and the bad company (for any battlefield players) and it is wonderful! I love it keeps the s**t posting up badger
I’m considering putting myself in a coma so when I wake up there will be more badger videos
wife???
goated with the sauce
Really appreciated coughing that diesel exhaust for us
I have been waiting for this.
The unemployment going to zero low-key scared tf outta meeeee 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BRUH THE COMMANDOS, every other elite class just feels like heavy from tf2 but without the movement debuff, but the commandos, UNLIMITED POWERRRRRRRR, I dueled and won against a maul, granted a pretty ass maul but yall know how OP the heros are. Against competent heros I still take half their health before I go down its so rewarding dying to them
Can't wait for next video.
Bjr more war thunder when
you can fuck up the star wars franchise even more?!
That cloaker noise at 9:36 just put me so on edge rn
can we get a badger video where he just uses the footage of his mo-cap instead of using models?
the moment we saw this our entire friend group opened youtube
Bananakin Skywalker is my favorite star wars character
There are custom servers now with no mod limitation
BILK IS BING BUT YOGURT AND MILK
Beyond funny videos
I think this is honestly one of the best videos in a long time. I dunno what about it struck me as so amazing, but it’s one of the best you’ve released
BILK
8:19 is that tifa?
Shut your mouth up and get into the video GamerSups man.
are you ever going back to seige?
I was just watching the other battlefront video for a good laugh
SpiRe mUn

Mods with this game are amazing
i love this  This is such a good video
Try turning on the German voice setting for the clone announcer
Nice outro
I love the map bagger and the Stormtroopers in the background 🤔👌
This guy's videos are so good, I still watch the adds he make becuase they are entertaining.
They put da Obe Waon in duh shoda
Why do people actually give subs? Just to get their name on a screen? 😂
"Me and the homies ruining the Star Wars franchise"  Oh, Badger. You can't ruin that which has already become a decrept shell of "I SAW THE THING AND I CLAPPED" without a trace more of substance or passion.
14:15 I’m talking in the chat as Saltyshooter XD
goat
0:23 “but you’re the one getting smoked Gobby, (Gunfire) HAAAAAAAAAA
Salacious Crumb will not be silenced.
Just got a Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes ad, there is a conspiracy among us.
Now lets see Battlefront's player count rocket
Recipe hack, put 2 scoops of guacamole gamer fart 9000 into a Starbucks iced caramel macchiato, trust
7:46 and that's the story of how the heavens and hell fell to the adorable little knees of a goddamn pink balck hole called kirby
Badgers Memory is deteriorating at the speed of B E S H
You know it’s a blessing when badger uploads
Badger, don’t know if you’ll read this but I assure you I get a big ass dumbass smile every time I get the notification that you got a new video.
Imagine getting field tackled by a guy with a jet pack and white plastic armor that definitely was made in China
Other than the fact that battlefront 2 is cometely fuckered right now and you can barely get a game that you can actually kill people. There's a terrible bug or hack that causes everyone in the game to be invincible. Your health cannot go below one.
Someone please tell me how his suit works. Lol.
Hehe. Bananakin Skywalker
Heh
Got here at 179K
This man literally got sponsored by a debit card to play a game that originally wanted to steal everyone's money with their BS Loot Boxes.
I really hope you make a video on dying light 2 badger
That was hysterical. Keep up the great work.
This video was pretty pog
10:48 this can describe so many great games that are still somehow still alive
Russianbadger is always hilarious.
I fucking died at Bananikan Skywalker
HOLY SHIT, IT'S A NEW BADGER VIDEO
If Badger ever made a Destiny 2 video id probably die of happiness
solacious Crumb Products sky rocket after today
new badg vid wat wil he do
ROLLY POLLY GANG
Aight badjur, imma need that 5:25 as a gif my man. i got memes to make and thats is some a-tier ingrideince ya got there.
"still better than battlefield "
I love that one hour in and there's already 35k views LMAO
Yo I was watching this thinking it was the other battlefront video, and mid video I noticed it was a new one lol
Dawg... Badger is just in the pump room pumping good content out. P R I S T I N E
I have to agree, after racking kills with a heavy (I'm still weak to everything above) after getting my points I always choose the enforcer class. Even if there are heroes available, I can kill and do more than them with an enforcer.
Ight how long till the next sponsorship comes?
yall should do a tf2 video that would be the best vid this year. it would be easier to edit because that shit is in sfm
Do R6 stuff
More BF2? Sign me the FUCK UP
RussianBadger: "imma try to set Rey on fire while she fights Kylo" Kylo: "I have a better idea" Immediately uses the force to hold her in place the speed at which Kylo reacts to the flametrooper is just incredible
Nah he's a god
How does he do this, EVERY TIME?
Badger when are you gonna make a TF2 video you coward
Fun Fact: The Fear of long words is "Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia"
As someone who only plays basic classes, I know the pain of being an inferior race to hero players.
This channel makes me laugh love the new vid
9:16 Someone in the background saying "Heavenly are you ok?"
this was worth the wait
Mean really made a fnaf reference
When CSGO
BADGER!! There is a game called Planetside 2 where it’s pretty much a Battlefield game but Like a autistic Kid on crack with huge epic battles. It is the Best/Worst game on earth!
FINALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Each one of his videos are just another banger fever dream.
Yessssssss
i want homer with a light saber made from donuts
Master Chief, mind telling me what you’re doing in Star Wars Battlefront 2?
wtf what do you mean someone married a guy named S P E N C E R ????
Badger if you wanna try battlefront 2 again (please) they did fix the 1 health glitch but you should try the KYBER custom servers they are alot of fun and I think it would be a good video
I hope a video on Ready or Not is coming, I want to see some guacamole gamer fart 9000 powered high speed civilian execution. Or you could try Mordhau if you want to see naked black and ginger dwarves running around a medieval battlefield crushing skull with a big ass hammer.
Blow up javin 4, yea the triad that, it did not work. And the deathstar was blown up by a frickin tenagger from a dessert and som Jedi that refuses to die.
Wait Badger is fucking married?
I sometimes forget that Spencer looks EXACTLY like the type of person to work in finance whilst acting like the exact OPPOSITE of what I'd expect from someone who works in finance.
Question:Can you rewiev star wars republic commando?
Badger and Kylo turning Rey well done was pretty metal
How does this current thing Work I already Made a account and I used the code but I got nothing??? I Need some help.
Spawns as Vader “ta ta ke ga ma da ra kaht ah na”
YO THE NEXT VIDEO IS THE 600TH VID LETSSSS GOOOOOOO
whats funny is i watched this on twitch and i find it funnier on youtube
Every time I start playing a game this man uploads a video on that game. Now that’s what I call attending to your fans!
The puta master chief in the soder
I remember seeing the streams and just thinking that it's gonna be amazing
What do you mean "why did you not tell me about the right click" badger. Im poor i cant tell you
El Bananakin
Is that muhfukin Bananiken Skywalker
Shit that was from that movie with the big ass maze and the farting swamp wasn't it
The bananakin is honestly hilarious
Has anybody ever told you that you look like a young Johnny Knoxville
The lord hath returned
Im dissapointed that the first video is age restricted
I tried your guacamole gamer fart 9000 gamer supps and it's really fucking good
WAIT BADGER IS MARRIED?
Everyone else: Anakin as a banana!!   Me: *BANANA-KIN*
Remember: Tay-K killed someone in a Chick-fil-A parking lot.  _Chick-fil-A is sacred ground and it was tainted._
FINALLY
Badger I know you playing battlefront 2 but battlefront 1 is a thing that exis
3 of my favorite things badgers genius stupidity and Star Wars and mods for video games, it’s terrifying how much power he has with mods and it being Star Wars, can’t wait to see arthur running around with blasters or boba with a .500 smith and wesson
5:31 Why did I wheeze so hard at a dark souls knight absolutely dunking on Rey. 😂
Ngl guys, I think Badger likes salacious crumb
Oui matter
You should play the old battlefront 2
didn’t you had 6 mil subscribers once
I was hoping they were gonna play Battlefront II rather than Battlefront EA II. Aw well, this video will still be quite amusing.
I’m loving the new lighting on some of the stormtroopers in the talking segments
When we gonna get fnaf security breach gameplay?
Currently watching this
If badger makes more than 2 videos on a game you can tell it has some worth to it. For example his WoT videos vs his Warthunder videos
The First Order is a certified hood classic.
Yeah, find a squad of gamers like badger, that way any game will be fun, even 4d chess
yas
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
He literally got sponsored by money
YOU GOT ME ON DRIP FEED waiting for new videos but don't change because it makes you videos that much more specially cursed 🤣
I am surprised that badger was actually smart enough to cover up his credit card number
Honestly though...Badger is married? I knew he lived with someone but I ain't ever seen em lmao
Watching a new Badger vid while drinking guacamole gamer fart 9000. P E R F E C T I O N
You didn't ruin it, Disney already has
Less go
"one of the most recognizable and protected franchises", that was before the disembowelment... I mean the sequels
dude yall should play tf2
Yeet
Is this StarWars badger striktes back ?
Okay, the Alec Baldwin jokes, fucking funny. That being said, you guys are going to hell for that rotfl
That’s pretty based let’s be honest
holy shit they are literally making fun of someone dying on a set
It's just nice to know he's really having fun in editing
First 2022 badger vid yessir
I wonder what Badger would think of Deep Rock Galactic
Badger be like: Trading Offer I receive : a 1 month pause between videos You get: laughs + Brain Damage in a time of 15 minutes  Us:"Shut up and take my money!"
When badger said he was gonna mod battlefront 2 I thought he meant the good one... not dipshit ea
Hell yeah bro love the Grind and the absolute nuclear blast of humor
Wait, Dabger has an irl wife ?
Star wars perfectly maintain hahahahaha we let three idiots into our ranks and got the sequels
Back to teddy bear Vietnam in space!
Clickbait gone wild
I was just watching the other battlefront 2 video  bro this is awesome timing
the world's greatest Bounty Hunter, Spider-Man
A true fatherlander in the outro. Give me the oompapa music into my veins.
Just like the simulations!
bananakin
He likes Salacious Crumb because they have the same hairline
God I would love to see you guys playing TF2 (team fortress 2), the amount of chaos there would possibly make you guys look sane
Heheh bunger video funny
Wait a second..... he's MARRIED yooooooooooooo
I was hopeing to see cornobi. Bananakin is good though.
8:00 only for PC players tho, and also FFS Badger use your bloody skill points
Some lady married that hairline?
I refuse to believe Badger is married, his wife does not exist in my eyes.
I don't know about protected Disney managed to hurt it
I wasn't expecting an upload from Badger today. But goddammit I'm glad we got one. I was laughing to where I could only make wheezing noises.
Stream suggestion kill race with only infiltrator in coop (choose republic for best infiltrator) hope for Kashykk or Geonosis then just stand on the ramp and right click for Kashykk or capture the gunship area on Geonosis and spam right click (rinse and repeat till so caps point)
Nice
wait there are characters other than salacious b crumb?
Your lack of 4Loco disturbs me
Spoilers for the video:  Bet Rey is still cold in the middle.
I always love the Battlefront 2 vids
heard the new vegas gambling sound effects during the sponsored segment. I don't trust it.
0:13 You have been declared to be an enemy of the state. Your punishment is to listen to baby shark on 10 hour loop
Das some good shit.
Anyone wanna translate whatever it says on the bottom at 0:36?
You guys are nuts but also great fun.
Waitwaitwait bajur is married?
wait badger has a wife since when
Badger I bet my aunt that if I stayed out in the cold for twenty minutes she'd owe me an 8th and this video is already warming me up
Kyber started to host custom servers for Battlefront II, so if you manage to get it working, mods can go even crazier. And i am talking about immediate strike sort of crazy
Yo,you should play Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2
I wasn't expecting bananakin
14:18 This really what Halo Infinite looks like
>man starts out complaining about camera angles >QUIETLY BREAKS OUT TWO DOZEN MORE
Cringe?
POG
I’m so happy every time I see an upload
I watched this stream and holy shite this was crazy!
At this point bajur legit abusing the power of the mocap lol.
Man my Day just got better
There should be a petition to get badger in starwars as a storm trooper.  Have him an the squad be kinda like a live action version of the bad batch.
Damb 164k views in 1 hour
Remember when you subscribed to this dude for rainbow clips? Uhh yeah me neither.
Kylo vs Rey round 2, featuring Squad Badger in the background arguing about unemployment
Day 1 of wanting Tf2 video
They need to make a Pimp Vader mod.
watching this video before it gets age restricted
Even tho you ruin my childhood of Star Wars you made it even better then before 😭🤣🤣🤣
Where is halo infinite video? Did I miss it?
Ayo new Salacious Crumb merch just dropped
Whenever Badger posts a new video my panties get wet.
f*ck yeah
Not with all the hacks and the dumb 1hp glitch
Sith troopers are legit the best reinforcement in the game, only the Commando is at his level
2:25 wait... this isn't the Halo Infinite video i was waiting for........... was it?
As the Koolaid Man, I approve and am proud of my Koolaid Troopers. Glad to have you serve me, Badger
Badger, first of all great video as always, gotta admit I'm like that twitch viewer who totally didn't realize you were married Secondly, you should definitely play Risk of Rain 2 when the DLC comes out
i just played all the half life games - alyx and i am starting to see the little things like the explosive barrels and the combine death sounds in ur videos. i know its just source but still i think its cool
Seeing Kirby flying around with a lightsaber is the funniest thing ever
we back at it again at the EA content mines
Like the Russian Badger from Fortnite?
Can’t imagine the chaos they would do in the new private matches
Always excited to see a new video
The commitment to the Crumb bit is top tier.
Eyewitness 1st hand banana again
XD Bruh, you and the gang make star wars better. You guys should make the new Starwars movies. Star wars : The rise of the shit poster.
14:59 *The green side of the plantation is a gateway to many abilities some would consider to be UNNATURAL*
The strategy to end unemployment on yavin 4 was EXACTLY what Bolsonaro tried while handling the pandemic here in Brazil...
Russian badger makes me want hop on a game again
Bro me last name is Baldwin.
Badger you and the boi’s can’t ruin Star Wars any more than Kathleen Kennedy
feels like years since a battlefront video, thank you for blessing us
Random thought, I am drinking soup out of a cup I just threw in the microwave
BADGER BADGER BADGER BEST YOUTUBER
I just wanna see Badger play Deep Rock galactic and have a blast with it
*YouTube demonetized badger AGAIN* Badger: you cowards can’t stop me
They should voice stormtroopers in Lego skywalker saga
yo wnat master chief mod is that i wanna use it
Did you know that doc ock made a gas that made everyone deathly allergic to cocane
Yoooo Star Wars hacker front 2
FINALLY, *CONTENT*  Now make more
You should mod payday next time
I would love to be pointed in the direction to these mods. Might make me pick the game up again like your last video did.
I'm so happy you're back i love your videos
I’m something of a Jedi myself
Helloooooo
Badger discord server. These words speak for them selfes.
I feel bad for the guy with the subwoofer when Badger said volume up
Free the boy crumby
Honey wake up, TheRussianBadger posted
I would love to see the these people as a random group of troopers
Yo check it, alderan went from GDP per capita to GDP per meteorite
This is the greatest Birthday Gift I could have asked for
Yo all the cash you make be so worth it bro you investin in your content and it shows! Legend bro🔥
Another video lets go
PLAY TITANFALL 2 PLS
Damn curby coming at me is terrifying
I was expecting another the video to be like the first one but this was a pleasant surprise
Badgers content is associated with happy in my brain, it's like neuron activation, I get dopamene just from seeing the title
I feel like this is still gonna get demonitized because of the Alec Baldwin jokes.
I really thought you were gonna die alone
Wait…Badger’s Married?!
Well well well If it ain't the G.O.A.T of YouTube
gg😆
Poggers
I CAN SEE YOU!!! I AM LOOKING AT YOU!!!
LOLLL he mod it
Wait badgers married?
Wait till he discovers private servers
LETS GOOOOO
STAR WARS Attack of the Cringe
I mean the battlefront 2 modding community on pc has made the game much better
I’m gunna sound like to much of a grateful mother fucker but I just had my psycho phobia triggered so thanks for the calm down badge
13:05 SCORCH!!
Mmmmmm content good I see
I literally just binge watched badgers vids this morning bc i was desperate for content.
Yeah but (Music Jam)  I can't agree more but something funny while badger was uploading this video is was watching war of thunther so Lol 🤣👌 yeah the wait was worth it
Did badger forget that the sith troopers grenade is called the OPPRESSION GRENADE?!?!
My friends and I have a joke… Yooo! Christmas from Fortnite?!?
Is he loves the newer battlefront games he should try the originals  (Like if you agree)
You won't play garden warfare 2 no balls
NEW VID LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Chess
Wait... this man married?
Why is there so much of b crumb
I think that, out of your uploads over the past year now, this is the only one that made me disappointed in you.
M hairline
0:57 6 was so out of focus lmaoo
He’s back
It may have only been 30 seconds of jokes on your video, but I actually understand what happened on the "Rust" shoot. Everyone who chooses to blame Alec Baldwin is acting a little dumb and not using their best judgement.
*Me casually watching battle front die*: oh Lord help us *badger* hollllll up you say sumin
Heavenly Glamrock Freddy was something I didn’t think I needed
Another amazing video by badger
Honestly I would love it if more casual gamers came into Battlefront 2. The game would all just be full of dipshits having a good time
Been scrolling YouTube all day bored of everything then 40 secs into this video And I’ve already died laughing 3 times
How many orders of games supps do I have to buy for you to play the old battlefront 2?
I am 2000% surprised that DigitalVagrant is in this video.
Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing in Star Wars?  Sir... killing Bananakin
Welp, if you upload a planetside 2, you'll kill the playerbase
I bought all this salacious crumb merch with the power of friendship and this credit card i found!
Badger has the only sponsorships I watch
I deadass thought this was an old vid cause all the thumbnails look the same. 🤣
This man needs to play Titanfall
Watching Badger videos keep reminding me I need better friends to game with 😭🤣
One of the most protected franchises on the planet. All while being ruined by disney. Yeah its real protected chief.
I love not only the content but how much he loves his friends and appreciates them Da badge out here livin
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
He is a man that is above a saga
I had to wait for the ads to start playing just to take a sip without spitting it across my monitor I was laughing so hard.
Why, just why.
i didnt even know this man was married. well shit she married a dip-shit but atleast its a good one.
so fun fact about the god mode glitch its from when a past hacker was on that server made himself god and then the server doesn't reset so when a new game happens on that said server everybody gets god mode
Iam still hoping you guys play some red dead redemption some time THIS DECADE
as a person who loves star wars. crossovers are the best.
Oh my god the Alec Baldwin shit lmao
I have no idea how you have a channel this big and still manage to keep the content top-tier, but I’m glad you do.
4:34 i miss. The part where thats my problem
Badger why do you look like the guy you meet at your high school reunion that tries to scam you into joining a pyramid scheme?
Woop woop more badger to watch
I would pay just to see a series on disney plus where it is just badger and his friends playing a group of misfit stormtroopers and just fucking around on the job. i wouuld pay to see that as a disney plus show
The timespan of badger’s video are longer that GTA loading screen
Yay new sauce
Air soup? That's a new one. He ever eat a ketchup sandwich? That's for when you're too poor for sugar.
next video Genshin Impacted My Soul
Please I need more of this dumb s*** content
Bad jer
Shit better than the sequels
Wait Badger's married!?
he found the password  also why did he change from the black company soldier model to this one ?
You are the best Badger!
ayo the shitposting god has a wife? legendary my dude
Dey put da mamster cheft in da soder
8:32 rest in peace Irish 🙏
Why you should use Current: Salacious B. Crumb
YESS, HE POSTED AGAIN
At this point being de-monetized by YouTube is like a badge of honor
B E A N S
Worth the wait , but can we get a Halo Infinite video next?
THEY PUT THE MASTER CHIEF IN THE STAR WARS
I find it super interesting that Current is sponsoring people about a few years after I used it. Amazing vid as always!
YES FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING SO EAGERLY
heavenly sounded like a fucking microwave in the last part
Bagur I need more info on current, on the next video can I see the numbers on the back, for research.
Bro I just discovered Bajur has a fucking waif-
WAAAAAAAAAHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! BADGER VID!
Dude production value is more than BF2042....
I live for these videos. By the end of the month, im ready for the dopamine hit that is badgers tomfuckery
Payed actor wife lol we know you ain’t got one
me when I see a new RussianBadger video: *visible happiness* EDIT: best laugh all week, thanks badger
I was telling my friends this previous weekend that I predicted there would be a new badger video within the week.  Glad I can be smug
Our monthly dose of happiness has returned. TIME TO WHEEZE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
Finally our lord has returned “TAKE ME GOD”
“There’s a fine line between based and cringe. And somewhere, in Source Filmmaker, they’ve sent us to find it. We get cringe, the world stays based, that’s the mission.”
I really wish he would play some TF2
Amazing 🤩
Wouldn't even be surprised if Badger just makes a Salacious Crumb shrine with that current card
Thought badger would die alone like us
I'm convinced that the duolingo owl supports public executions
Please post some r6 badger
You are now breathing manually
Imagine how terrifying it would be if you were fighting Kylo Ren, he puts you in force stasis and just walks away. And then a single flametrooper walks in.
Neat
hold up you were able to die??? I miss dying :/
I can't wait for Space Marine 2, mainly because I know there's gonna be a Badger video about it
The time it takes for battle front 2  too to load is on par with the time it takes for GTA v to load
Please, you and the boys have to try out Hunt:Showdown! It's made by the same guys as Crysis so it's already metal af and it's a blast with your buddies (if you win).
Master Chief<Master Jedi
badger can we get a video of bloopers/outtakes with the mocap suit
Badger just showing off his sfm skills at this point.
Every video is banger my guy.
Please put that poster of crumb on your recording room wall with your face in the forefront.
Love your content as always. Day 8 of asking for you to play Titanfall 2
kirby + yoda = koda
I love it how everything in Star Wars is so advanced but at the same time blasters practically have the effective range of a modded Nerf gun and slugthrowers which are basically the equivalent of a normal firearm are even less effective than a musket.  Master Chief would canonically be OP in the Star Wars universe.
God I can't wait for badger to run for president. 2044 I swear its gonna happen.
Baldwin stuff was a little fucked up.
How I excepted that one class is better than the other ones and my friends still made it fun. In the the words of Russian badger THATS Battlefield 1 For You Bud
Fella's, if badger can get married we still have hope!
wait he's married
why is badger simping for salacious b. crumb
The funniest thing about that Alec Baldwin movie is that it’s reportedly about someone going on the run after an accidental shooting.
The immortality hack even influenced PvE modes for some reason. But me and my bud found a way to kill ppl anyway not to brag or anything
The king uploads once more!
Badger they have the solactious crumb (I don't know how to spell) as a toy and it can sit on ur shoulder and has a controller to move its head and make it laugh
🤔
Badgers fucking married? This isnt a joke, i had no fuckin idea.
Hear me out, what if George offered Badge a cameo in the Book Of Boba Fett?
Yo, any way to get Chief as a death trooper on xbox?
Just what I needed on a slow work day.  Badger, Spider-Man memes, and more Battlefront 2!
"unemployment falls to zero when you commit gynecide on a fucking planet" Thats just the average pacifist playthrough of Stellaris
>used to work in finance  RIP white collar shirt badger 😔
This video is so fire
Badger is at this point just true Yt treasure.
"it's Master Fucking chief" that hit me way harder than it should have
You didn’t use a voice clip from the Star Wars movies when trying to open the blast doors. 0/10 marking this video for horrible quality
Ah so that's what that was, the line "you look like an overgrown kowakian monkey lizard" suddenly has a lot of sting to it.
if you want to play with proper mods, theirs a program called frosty mod manager and kyber, my friend mods BF2
Badger:  Welcome back to me and the Homies ruining the star wars franchise  Me: what are you talking about?! You're improving it
yo i'm the earliest i've ever been, still an hour late BUT STILL
I better enjoy this before Alec Baldwin’s legal team takes it down
That shuffle dance at the end of the video restored my will to live
Now, go do Battlefront 2 OG modded
Was waiting for your vid more than for new Boba Fett episode
These videos makes a bad day immediately better
He uploaded
TEY PUT DA MASR CHIF I DA SODA
We could rule this galaxy together, Spider-Man!
Glad to see another video on Battlefront II
I honestly want current cause it sounds amazing as a bank and the like  but i'm in canada and they don't got that shit here man :(
Dementia gaming doing good work.
Wiping out a planet to remove an economic problem feels like a Halo 5 Cortana thing to do.
Please play tf2
Go on, dislike the video, it won't un-grouse the Tauntaun
See if you can make destiny 2 fun again
Ngl badger looks like tech support
Nice.
Loved watching the stream
To quote his halo reach vid  "Ive been flashbanged by words"
20 fucking camera in this bitch.
Lol I was in that Twich stream too XD. And I saw all the gifted subs. It was crazy.
Why do you always shoot yourself now
I beg you check out the Kyber private servers, it lets you play the gameplay modding mods on private matches  You cannot be banned for it and it is stupid how much shit the community has added
i fear that we are losing Badger. Next video he will start turning into Salacious B Crumb
I’m in class right now watching this I love his vids
Sorry im can't support your sponsor im from europe :D
after watching the emoji movie 15:41
One hour ago and already two thousand comments.              I would also like to say, even as a Fortnite player, a bullet was definitely deserved for that beginning part.
Great video! Time to watch more Badger on repeat until the next one
Funniest game videos on YouTube since machinima
Better watch it early before this video got age restricted again.
Bannakin stop panickin Jesus has a planakin!
Ah yes, my monthly dose of shit posting from badger.
Every video is like a movie that you can watch 7 times in a row without thinking about it while under the influence of Xanax.
I wish I could find friends like yours, badger.
TheRussianBadger and zanny in the same hour? Let’s freaking go
More badger shit posting after one whole month
I’m dying from laughter
BANANAKIN!!!
wow
A video a month is okay with level of laughs and quality LOVE YOU BADGER 💙💙
Bro I always get happy when I see a new upload by my boi badger
Every video has been such a blast thank you badger for being the world’s best shitposter
0:09 dude am I having a fever dream again? I just had one-
YouTube: We demonized his Battlefront video. We should be safe now. Badger getting sponsors: I'll fucking do it again
This video is a certified hood classic.
Badger forgor what he was gonna say 💀
"packin heat like alec baldwin" its finna be one of THOSE videos
When you start seeing Bananakin, its best to start panickin,
mf out here lookin like Salacious B. Crumb
Can you do rainbow extraction
The Empire needs to strike EA next
Not even 5 minutes later, now I gotta rethink the hot pockets I just ate.
Wer Tf2 u biatch
remember people, Badger has a mo-cap suit and he had to do every one of the actions seen in the video, including the outro shimmy shammy.  That's why we love him.
dey put da matuh cheef in da battul frunt
ah yes my favourite saga including but not limited to Star wars the cringe awakens,revenge of the crips,attack of the hoes and and a new cope
Rey being barbequed would definitely have been an interesting twist in Episode 9.
nice,
thoseapples8
A badger video? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP!!!
SWAWS
Best video of all
I enjoy seeing the youtubers I love get premium sponsorships, get that bag bagur
After the latest book of boba fett episode, this is EXACTLY what I needed!!!
you can only sell an eith in chicago
12:35 look at the chat
Badgers wife's up when?
Random comment for channel interaction.
128K views in 1 hour
That time you're just about to take a nap but then there's a new upload   Never fails lol
I actually saw a bit of the stream but I have to say it is way better in video form
Dementia is back
Bananakin Skywalker
Another badger video, another shot of serotonin straight into my bloodstream (gimme that shit)
So Heavenly is now Glamrock Freddy, that's great
Dey put da mamstre ciehf in da stir wers.
8:45 “Packin heat like Alex Baldwi-“ Jesus Christ badger
Liked the video while the ad was loading up bc I already know that it’s worth the wait
That motion capture suit has to be one of the greatest decision on Badger's channel.
Wait you got married?!?!? How long have I not known?
This man got a sponsorship and then proceeded to create a Salacious B. Crumb Fan Club  "Your behavior frightens and confuses me, sir."
What is your strange obsession with Salacious Crumb??? I’m worried
Just came across this searching up battlefront 2 randomly. 1 minute in and im already loving channel
Time to wait another month for a very good video
I fucking hate that puppets laugh.  It's a great puppet
Wait Badgers married? Twitch lets you do that now?
Good lord badge how do you keep making bangers
Always a good Day when you Upload
The return of the king
You should do a video on titanfall 2 northstar client
“SPIDER MAN.” ~TheRussianBadger 02/23/22
“Exactly 2 minutes” *actually takes 2 minutes and 54 seconds*
Buba fett is a bomber jet
@5:14 - -  *Stares nervously at all the retcons in the old EU alone
Hey are you ever gonna make a halo infinite video at some poiny.
Here before this shitpost gets age restricted
Early on a badger video for the 1st time
Gotta say. I. LOVE. Wanton stupidity and unnecessarily hectic violence. And that's what you get when you mix Badger with Battlefront II and mods.  Amazing.
Please guys play some TF2
If you right click with the Flametrooper his Flamethrower becomes an incendiary grenade launcher
This new halo lookin different
playing a game from 2005? how strange for this channel
Wait, badger is married????
New badger vid heck yeah
180th less goooo
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Only in a RussianBadger video can you watch someone derail and bring up Alec Baldwin getting a dead ringer in a Star Wars game
If that's true you guys need to hop on the titanfall too
Badger, stop giving Biden ideas with the unemployment problem.
What not butter? Let’s hope this video won’t get age restricted like the last one.
Les goo new badger vid
I feel like these videos are national treasures
fuck yea badger video on my birthday
Man, when this "bank locker full of content" uploads, you sure as hell not going to be disappointed...🤣🤣
Gotta watch it before it's going to get age restricted!
Play deep rock galactic, would be cool if you did
nice
Dey put da Mawsder Chimf in de Star War, bro  I'll... see my way out
Badger's videos are the definition of *quality content*
BANANAKIN SKYWALKER
I just had a bunch of Braces put on me and its pain,thanks for the video
He has come back!
Never tell this man about orks from wh40k
The “Current” me is now “Currently” dying.
It is always a good day when the badger uploads :)
Demonitize it
Where 90% of  the servers are god mode
"Battlefront 2 allows that perfectly maintained universe to be smashed by my chaotic friends"  Nah, actually that universe was smashed the moment Disney bought it
Ahhh
badger you are a legend and I absolutely love your videos, and I think you should really start playing Team Fortress 2. You will love it.
god damn it i love this man
The one thing that I love about RussianBadger is his flawless consistency *to make a dayum hilarious video.*  The first Battlefield 2 video was scarred by all the Ewok madness but this one will most definitely go down for all the blursed mod going on. 😆🤣
Loved the video badger
You have too much money dude😂! I love it
I live for the Chaos that is Mods, Shitposting, and Memes
AND THEY BE SAYING SPIDER MAN DONT KILL. BITCH PLEASE
Kirby takes no prisoners lol
Hehe
Play team fortress 2
Might be only 16 minutes but it's the best 16 minutes ever.
All this video did is further my love for star wars and TF2 video
DE PUT D MAMSTR CHEEF IN D SAR WR
oh btw there are custom servers now made by the comunity, that have custom game modes and mods. its called Kyber
Jesus badger forgettin shit he gonna say again, damn he really do he having Alzheimer's like he said
More videos released AT A TIME BRO
Halo now canonically shares a universe with Star Wars  Change my mind
Had to go get a cup of guacamole gamer fart before I started the video
So like for the giveaway what happens if I already have a current account?
I wonder how you would think about destiny 2 when witch Queen is released
Nobody tell him about the kyber custom servers with mod support
I love the idea of you guys all making a game of D&D or tf2 even more chaotic than I thought possible
lmao
master chief, you mind telling me what your doing in battlefront?
U are cringe funny
HWLL YEAH BRUTHER
YOU CAN KILL PEOPLE?!
8:30 Oof Badger, BF4 isn't in great shape itself especially with the lack of servers on console. Tbf I haven't seen a single hacker at all on PS4, but it's not the best thing to use as an example of EA "working on other projects."
MONTHLY DOPAMINE HIT AQURIED
At this point I'm just commenting to comment.
God Prank em Alec
The sigma male spoke
Got it. So the Covenant solved the unemployment problem on Reach
I wanna know how did Heavenly evolve from a spicey one-eyed meatball demon and now he’s freaking Freddy Fazbear from Security Breach?
Ay man, do movie battles 2 jedi academy mod, it has literally everything you want in a game lol
TF2 PLEASE
Hi banger you should play dying light 2 with the boys and I love your videos keep up the good Work
I have a new idea off a star wars show where we start out with someone who is a jebi and you think for the first few episodes that the jebi is the main character. But then get killed by a random stormtrooper with god tier aim
how. fucking. old. is. badger?! dude looks old as hell!
Battlefront 2 with a side of Shitposts
One line "Spider man!"
These videos are just full of stupid dumb humour...and I absolutely love it 😂😂
So glad this game is getting the love it deserves
Didn’t even know badger was married lol
Bless you Badger, your content keeps me going.
if Heavenly remains the Freddy Fazbear model I'll love this forever
The lord has returned with another battle front II video
Man bought the crumlectors edition
Maintained till they added neon motorcycles to the cannon
Can we get more r6
15:24 how did you encapsulate my brain to such a good level on that single frame? also your previous video on battlefront 2 convinced me to get the game :)
I mean, the special classes are supposed to be superior to the regular ones
8:23 was that the terraria hurt noise?
Wait Badger has waif?
Imma need that master chief mod
EA make game then abandoned it
Legend! On God!   Now, we need a Ready or Not video next! Wanna see Badjur and the boys being pistol-whipped by masked men with Uzis sprinting faster than Usain Bolt.
So u can say this video is curently sponsored
It's a good entire week when badger uploads
<3
DEY PUT MASHTER CHEEF IN DA BLUE MILK
Ruining? Bro you’re making Star Wars better than the most recent movies
When payday leech video
Yes! Another video from the King himself. Immediately opening with a fortnite joke as well. Perfect.
EA restricting what mods work.  Cowards. They should jsut go 'fuckit EVERYTHING GOES and then on top of that SPONSOR you setting everything on fire.   Because i'm gonna be real with you man? That master chief skin honestly looks dope as hell and Potassium Skywalker  is like. The best kind of 'what the fuck'.
Hey bager I'm also pretty fucking bad at lightsaber but I rock with either heavy or officer troopers.
1782rd heh I was not first but I was 1782rd
Master banakin theres too many of them what are we going to do?
Badger, you underestimate the power of Kirby. If he's powerful enough to kill a galactic monster hellbent on destroying planets, he can easily kill Darth Maul.
I’m lucky I got to see some of these clips when he streamed.
I hate this game because of the 1 hp glitch
When I heard mods in BF2 I was worried that it would be as wild as the LFD2 video but this was surprisingly tame.
Battlefront 2 was so fun. Too bad they stopped making content for it tho
I like taking out enemy capital ship turrets and bait the enemy near mine
my daily dose of serotonin
A new RussianBadger video just came out? LET'S FUCKING GOOO!
By God. He's done it. Referenced republic Commando. I'd love to see you play through it and just dunk on some dumb ass Geonosians. It's also got some actually stupid mods too I'm pretty sure.
Okay Kirby what makes you want to become a Jedi?  Kirby: Poyo ✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧
Rebels are for goofs and 5 year olds, Empire forever.
Can we see a battlefield 2042 1944 video
AHHHHHH
This video has served to remind me that I miss this game and I wish I still had it  Also can't believe you didn't even mention the ARC Trooper
You are awesome Badger. keep up the good work for years to come. I hope to see more of your whacky shennaginans
Badger and homies really feel like a squad of mad stormtroopers.
W
That’s like London fletcher with the jet trooper good lord
10:30 this rebel is just asking to get the glock
rip tabg
*Epic*
Green goblin: it's too late spiderman weed has been legalised Spiderman: that may be true but you're the one getting smoked gobbie AHHHHHHHHHHH
Someone outta tell him that theirs private servers now with crazy game changing mods
He’s back! When we needed him most, he came back!
Hey Badger, do you think we could get a behind the scenes vid of you using the mocap suit?
If you use the speed ability on the sith trooper and melee while sprinting you can kick the crap out of people
Another badger video another head set destroyed.
Thank you for not forgetting tf2
Skulker isn’t here because he is still in federal prison for the last video
I'll join the dark side when u FIX THIS DAMN DOOR.
No not again! Not the Star Wars stupidity! Things are gonna be to funny!
We need Badger to do a video on TF2 at some point, the combined chaos would be epic
Episodes 7-8 would be so much better if it ended 10 minutes into episode 7 with Rey getting toasted immediately. Kwispy
I’m almost 100% sure I’ve watched every single badger video at least once
It was nice to see Spider-Man on stream myself.
thats a nice pile of hats. tf2 when
like 1 hour ago i said why isnt he uploading anymore
damn im never getting pinned ha
Badger. If it wasnt for the current issues, I would beg your dawg ass to make a Titanfall 2 video with the homies, all while on my hands and knees.
Gee, Bajur, why your lips turned blue in the sponsor section? Fckn drowned in the "Current" amirite
Kinda sus not gonna lie
this game seems to like encouraging me to break the geneva convention
#1811
14:17 First covenant, then banished, now first order, *Chief is going places.*
I hope it isn't age restricted again so I can't watch
I misx payday2 content yes yes boom boom fun
haha
After 1month ^-^
I can't tell if I'm watching for the enjoyment, or if this is like a cult and I can't stop watching due to the amount of shitposts is in one video everytime.
12:10 damn them shots hit harder than my dads belt
All the darkside enforcers are stupid busted. First Order is on a whole other level of crack, tho, their Specials are legitimately stronger than some named heroes
He just keeps getting better and better with his models and animations. Wtf.
Ruin Star Wars, or make it BETTER?
I was weazing at the alec baldwin tf2 domination sound effect bit. That reminds me: You guys should do a video on team fortress 2, please, watching your videos I see characters, visuals and sound effects from the game keep coming out but have not found video of you guys playing it, which is a shame because its free and I think it could blast to new heights if you guys showed it off.
Badger, try the Kyber private servers. Unlimited modding and bullshit. Adds extra Classes, characters, weapons and other stuff
anyways as Hitler said after glassing 6 million people, "it was for the unemployment"
I love Heavenly's evolution. He went from cacodemon to Glamrock Freddy.
half of this video is repeated from the previous video but I don't mind bc it's fire
Great vid, you and the boys should play Risk of Rain 2, think it it just enough chaos to make a banger video
At this point Badger is daring EA to just delete him from all their games forever.
Tbh, already over with 2022, when they coming out with this 2023 shit?
THE RUSSIAN BADGER DEAD 💀
wimfe
First order jet trooper and I can not be stopped!
The fucking alec baldwin jokes got me geekin hard
YEEAAAH
Anyone else think it'd be pretty cool to see a huge LAN game of Badger's group on the 2005 Battlefront?
Burger will you take my hand in marriage?
Never busted faster
If you guys were in the Star wars universe you would all die to something dumb.
*INTENSE AND TRAUMATISING INHALE* SWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
9:22 Yes, a TF2 reference! I wanna see Badger do some TF2 now and beat some bulked up Russians as a skinny Boston dude with a frying pan XD
So, when will they play TF2. Would pay money to see these guys play MvM
BADGER BACK AT IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
You know what, it fits that heavenly was given glamrock Freddy to represent him, because they both can fit whole oversized birthday cakes in their stomach
Hi
Nice
I just saw this and was like, Wait, is that badger?
Hey Badger, would you ever consider making a video on TF2
Don’t forget bananakin or he will find you
woooooooooooo
this is why we cant have nice things, mr.badger
Every time I see Badger uploaded a video it just makes my day 100 times better, especially when Skulkers involved lool
Russian badger furry suit when
Hell yeah
Heavenly being GL Freddy: “Gregory, do you see that alcohol on that table? Get me it. I need it to eat this pizza because I’m lactose intolerant”
Death Troop is stronk.
RussianBadge is back at it.
spiderman but he has the crucible but the crucible look like a banana
Badger, if your only going to give us one video a month can you please make it longer than 20 minutes. You gettin a little greedy my friend
Ah yes badger here with my monthly fix
Baggur
"The rate of fucking everything turns to zero" WRONG the rate of deaths goes up
Hearing the voice line from SWRC brings me back. Oh man. #saveSev
Yo new burger video let's go
God damnit just make the tf2 video already
ster wers
The fact that I can watch this content for free is crazy
Heavenly being represented as Glamrock Freddy is absolutely perfect.
OOF
theres private servers now with kyber gg, ppl need to join the servers but its free from EA rule so you can mod the game even more, theres new custom heros and more
Love the guacamole gamer fart so much I bought a waifu cup thanks for that badger
wtf
Is this my monthly aneurysm coming back again.
uhhh...Gorge Lukes wasn't in charge of Star War BFI and II, it was by some other "guys" who did it and Karen Woman the who ran the fucking ruin New 2 star war movie that fuck up luke the original person.
within 57 min of post
New vid letsss gooooooooooooo
are you go to pla r6 for a vid?
Ayy Yo
Your editing skills get better with each video. An amazing video as usual.
Finally
this vid has made my day even more perfect like "naruto in fortnite"
Damn there were like 5 joke that were actuly funny these jokes are geting worse
TODAY JUST GETS BETTER NEW OLIVER TREE AND RUSSIANBADGER GOD DAME ! ROAST ME A BISCUIT MOMMA!
Yay for badger
Hi badger big fan have a good day
Really tho. EA needs to get their head out of their ass and continue with this game and battlefield v. 2042 is honestly broken beyond repair
Wait a minute is that a ring on his finger, did he get married?
I’ve been subbed since your first R6 video, and I had no goddamn clue you’re now married. Congrats
I think unemployment would be at 100% because no one has a job if they're dead
E
Goddamn it he modded battlefront 2
Bananakin Skywalker lol. This has been a Bread comment.
I've finally found someone who likes Salacious Crumb as much as I do.
Star Wars….the game where master chief go to the planet earth to save it from banana Vader and apple god of war with the help of the three Egyptian god digimon. With the power of anime and friendship, they will win against the bad guys called teen orange.
I’m so happy that this video came up when it did
Lets go another badger upload
Badger is lowkey a huge fucking nerd when it comes to Star Wars
haha i did a lil gifting xD
As a person who was there for the sub war it was an actually crazy experiencing it live and all those fellas were absolutely based. Please go check out Badger's streams if you haven't yet, there are so many funny and epic moments that don't make it into these videos.      P.S. Badger pls play Enter the Gungeon, its like if The Binding of Isaac, TABG, Touhou, any pop culture thing with a projectile, and Dark Souls had a pissed off psycho baby ready to shoot your kneecaps to oblivion. And if that didn't convince you, there is an M1 with the iconic reload sound. The game is available on everything from PC to Nintendo Switch, and comes packed in with 2 person local multiplayer.
Can’t believe I was here early
Best YouTube video
15:53 *HNNNG WAIF?!?!?*
Awesome video as always :)
Hey badger I know u probably won't see this but I just wanna let u know that u make my day go from bad to good in seconds when I get the YouTube notification that u uploaded another banger of a video so thank u for being such an amazing content creator.
cool
I haven’t laughed this hard in months I nearly threw up my round meal I was dying
This man is gonna single handily revive battlefront 2 and give ea more money how sway the capitalist giving the captiltalist money
AWWW YEEAAAH!!! IVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONE!!! Great job as always Badger! You’re videos always make me less depresso espresso!!
Spiderman should've followed Darth plagueis to bring back uncle Ben
It ain't a Badger video unless it starts with an explosion and the sound of my ears ringing.
This man is Gmod shitpost in person
Badger should use kyber private servers to play mods online
I took so long to realize that the turquoise one was Digi I'm so stupid I was genuinely listening to a 2 seconds part 10 times over to try and recognize the voice
You should play terraria
Badger turning on California dreaming while playing flametrooper
of course this definition of a white boy has worked in finance.  Not saying that's bad. I mean I am a stereotypical german and I work in finance so yeah it makes sense.
wait holup bager got married? like not meme he is actualy married?
Badger is just a deep-fried meme that gained sentience.
Going say I think Badger’s favorite Star Wars character is definitely salacious crumb
Yo, why the fuck do you have Freddy up in there?
Its over Bananakin, I have the high ground
If Skulker doesn't stop using "Hello mario" I will personally find and post the entire Mario Sex Education script to every video
Oh no. Saw the video and clicked immediately
Badger is the only Youtuber I know whose sponsor ads are an essential part of the viewing experience.
Now yall gotta do a video on team fortress or ima start a revolution in chilli
Ayo you gotta try super people yes that is a game and also banana danana banana danana
And Just like the Fortnite Simulations
nice
Please for the love of God keep Heavenly as glam-rock Freddy it fits so fucking well I have never fucking laugh so hard in my life
Had a feeling he was gonna post today
If this comment gets pinned I'll
First Order Jet Troopers are literally just demoknights. They charge in, get a few kills and die
I feel like 60% of this was just Badger talking, 10% sponsorship chatter, and then 30% actual gameplay and jokes.
Badger is the most successful man that has a hairline that looks like the McDonald's logo
Badger pls do TF2
Somehow each of his videos are more chaotic than the last. Is nice
He talked about current three minutes after saying he will... I have been bamboozled and my current credit card is in my wallet.
Gahd dahm ive been waitin for another battlefront vid
I wonder if Badger will figure out that Kyber GG exists and the mods there are awesome, and you can use your own stuff to make the best servers.
As the goldbloom says....ah life ahhhh finds  a way
Man if Badger loves bad shit games he should look at the Earth Defense Force series
alec beldwin jokes were really funny, but a person literally died because of him, i dont think thats good to laugh at
Sci-fi Flameflower, that fits Badger and his friends so well!
Republic Commando Reference, Meesa Likey
The death trooper is literally every class other than support in bf1 everyone damn gun except support is like one shot
I wanna see bager olay tf2
FYI, dice is working on a fix for the 1-hp glitch
Badger you and the homes should try for honor especially they now added a pirate with a gun. The emote spamming with the funny executions and your guys humor would make it soo funny
i apperciate the old battlefront 2 menu sound with the camera change
Okay, current, got it, but what electrical tape do you use?
yo i have been hoping for more battlefront content for a while!!
My sadness is gone yay
make a video on tf2
The boss baby now has a confirmed kill
Radger's parried?
Why do some of the sound effects hang for half a second longer than they should?
This does put a smile on my face.
Someone should tell badger about Kyber. He and the boys would love those custom servers
This man got a wife?
Have you ever played as the Empire ISB agent her melee is MmMmMoist
babe wake up badger posted
Ah shit, here we go again
Bananakin Skywalker made me laugh more than it should’ve 😂
14:17 Lore-accurate Master Chief
GREGORY!!! do not say clanker, that is very rude
Let’s hope this one doesn’t get age restricted
Is that what happens when a bunch of idiots use the force?
God. I was honestly scared this game was dead. Couldent find a match at all yesterday
I love the futurerama reference bender is based
Eyyy here before 100K views lets gooo
Yo Badger, if you like fucking with mods then you have to check out the KYBER custom servers and private games. You don't have to worry about the invincible servers and can put whatever mods you want in a private match without the hand  of EA taking away your rights.
You know..most YouTubers evolve over time..not TheRussianBadger. (This is meant as a compliment)
After a month yesssss thank you.
Republic infiltrated and commando are based
Yo I ordered some gamer supps with a waifs cup before Christmas and they’re still not here. WHERE DA FUCK MY GUACAMOLE GAMER FART
hello mar..........(static)
Early Gang
battlefront takes so little brain power that it's my comfort game
No fucking way.......... A Wonder happened
Every damn video is worth the wait! Bananakin Skywalker for the win!
Arc trooper right click is also insane
badger please tell me you are preparing to cover space marine 2, your warhammer videos introduced me into the games and I'm so thankful for it!
After what Disney did to Star Wars, the only way from the bottom is up
These guys really should try a career as comedians
Yes a Russian badger video time for war crimes and great content
This is why we wait. For the quality of his content. This is amazing!
The moment you said "Mic check, one two." I had to stop and comment. Hello, yes, you called?
Another masterpiece by the Badger from the glorious nation of Mother Russia.
If this gets copyright claimed, it means that banakin, Master Chief and Kirby are cannon in the Star Wars universe
I never thought he’d do another Battlefront vid 🥳
great job spencer this is the best video yet
Yo I can't wait for the sequel video where you crash the kyber gg even more moddable private multiplayer servers with your audience. Ever since the immortality exploit I've mainly played on mod servers with gameplay reworks, and it's been glorious (minus occasional pain of setup time).
God I still can’t get mods to work
6:50 I mean that is how the Job Center in my country works We need to drop the unemployment rate, lets just kick people out, Problem solved because there is no unemployment if its not registered
Mmm perfect the channel thats great for my adhd brain that needs action constantly. help.
Who THE FUCK likes salacious crumb!?!?!
Now only if we can get them to play team fortress 2 😂
Badger is married?
1,5k comments within an hour congrats
First video of 2022! Hope it's going good so far!
I completely forgot about this game. Badger makes me not only remember these cringe games but he makes them funny too
Badger we need more sponsorships til ypu have a code for every single one. Cause we live in a society
Hmm
badger I just want to say thank your videos are really helping me get through tough times and British highschool aka hell on earth
“Hey, what’s your favorite Star Wars character?” “You remember the monkey thing from Episode 6?”
WAIT A BANANAKIN SECOND! Badgur is married?! Bruh this manz got everything I don't, money, happiness, gf, like damn I'm gonna have to follow heavenly at this point
“Hold up…MMMMMMMMMM”
Badger and his squad is literally the Bad Company squadron of the Star Wars universe.
I didn't know mods existed for this game
I keep seeing his head bob back and forth and side to side
Again, the quality has improved even more, soon this man shall shitpost in 1080k
"bananican I am your father"
Pretty sure he already chocked when the sequel trilogy came out
Why is it whenever I re watch old videos the next day a new one is released
5:36 now this is how that shitty trilogy should’ve ended
The Roast of Alec Baldwin
Bruh, I've been playing this game since day 1 and never knew you can charge as jet trooper in the first order
Bro skie you made my whole year , this who year is shit already 💀💀
Plz make a rainbow video
Ah yes  My monthly dose of Badgertonin  This is what we like to see
Hell yeah  BANANAKIN is in the game
I needed this today
When the world needed him the most
Hi
Next star wars movie ray is gonna end the plot with a smith & western 500 bone collector
The security breach jokes are strong with this one....
I once used the Republic Commando's repulsor blast to knock Count Dooku off a platform and killed him. Pretty sure that guy uninstalled, cause I ain't seen him since
I wonder if he knows about the salacious crumb you can buy at Galaxys Edge
I'm more concerned with hannah and Irish talking to ea
Moar lasers Bajur
Y’know. I’ve never actually seen an ATM with fees. Probably a benefit of where I live.
8:00 basically state of tf2 rn
Holy shit i'm early on accident
Yo Badger vid show up? Fuck ya, let's GO
So anybody here hit an Ewok with a Ford F-150 in the time before the release
This game is amaze balls 🤘🏻🔥 Actually played some co-op tonight. Would love to jam with u guys. I’m semi good… u know; like spawn or venom or zinger wings 😉 Let’s make it happen 💪🏻
does badger play on kyber or are normal servers being fixed yet?
Bananaskin Peelwalker
BOUT TIME BADGER WE BEEN WAITING LIKE A JUNKIE
This video should have been called "nuking planets to fix the economy"
Guacamole gamer fart 9000 is a superior substance.
2005 battlefront sounds in intro i'm liking it
This game's biggest crime is not having a Captain Rex skin for the Arc Trooper
man, i made a mistake playing this game at launch, it got so much better
I always cry tears of joy when a new bager video is up
Another TRB video I can finally steal more jokes
This video is brought to you by selacious crumb
Spooderman
Golden. As always.
Wtf is heavenly s main avatar feddy fazballs?
Gonk.
I actually hope the use the cloaker as Darth Vader
I want these guys to show up in an actual Star Wars show or movies. As either a squad of stormtroopers, or a group of guys in a cantina scene.
You don’t know op till you have played the god damn soccer balls, use the middle ability, wipe a room, out damage a fuckin lightsaber, it’s amazing
Once again a super a nice video, im dying 🤣  For every who is reading this: how does he handle copyright? I mean he is using all the diffenrent characters.
Don’t worry Badger according to George Lucas and Bob igors book where he blatantly says he had George by the balls, and threatened to sue and bankrupt him and Lucas Arts into the grave. If he left their bs contact they tricked him into signing with a Pixar like deal. Star Wars is already dead and it’s corpse is being pupated by Disney to milk it bone dry for money.
My reaction to badger uploading: 😩😞😮😲😀😊😂
Uh oh, its Bananakin
AYOOO HE'S  BACK
YES
wait... badger is married
We don’t deserve this kind of quality for free.
LETS GOOOOO
I just realized that badger went bald a few months ago and now he looks like he went back in time
13:06  Hold up, is that a fuckin RVB clip?!?!?
Why Fredrick Fitzgerald Fazbear?
Man you have the best fucking content KEEp it up
Unpopular opinion, battlefront 2 is underrated
YES I LOVE BATTLEFRONT SEVERELY UNDERRATED
Please more videos in 2022 pleeeeeeeaaaaaasssseeeee
5:50 do we wanna acknowledge the top of the chat? “In Soviet Russia badger rushes YOU”
YAS! More Ewok Burning!
Please make a video on rainbow six extraction that game needs someone to try it and actually see the good parts it has its getting hated by everyone and dont deserve it
Wow, he finally married his pikachu gf
May I ask the story behind the "oh yeah" that is behind litterally every clip you've ever made?
Badger, there's a mod that gives you access to a community server browser, where you can mod to your heart's content.
Yeah tell me about it they left star wars for a game that looks like a piece of crap. that’s the reason why I didn’t buy battlefield it’s loaded with crap so it can be ready to ruin another game just like there company. does anyone agree?
I clicked so fast I think I was going 300 football fields/Moon Landing.
plz
Does it make you feel like spiderman~
Oh Cool, Badger posted a new star wars video! Time to watch this before it gets restricted again.
Ahaahahhahahhahaahahahhahahahhahahahhahahqjhaua!
YES
Hold the fuck on badger is married.
play assassins creed odyssey
tachanka i need  moar TANKAKA HE IS GOD
Wait hold up your married
I can't use current even if I wanted to because I live in Trinidad    Anyways.... Love the video 😅
just saying they could of given me those subs
Babe wake up badger posted
Got finals tommorow for school, and been super stressed because of it.  But with this I think that everything is gonna be fine, thank you Badger.
Badger playing Battlefront 2 again was about as unexpected as EA fixing the game  *The only difference is Badger actually did it*
I'm watching while eating a pizza
I'm literally at a loss for words and I mean that in the most positive waya
I love the classic Star Wars Battlefront menu sounds you addended
Mightykeef
As funny as the first bit was, It pained me to hear Naruto's name be pronounced like that. Other than that, Comedy.
The thought of Badger and co. playing SWRPG fills me with unimaginable joy
I was just thinking we were due for a dose of high explosive dopamine today
BADGERS MARRIED?
Binge watching every badger videos bcuz I'm sick wit da virus and my PC broke I was just finishing now I got something new :b
Hope someone lets him know about the custom/private servers…..  EDIT: And the overhaul mods, additional characters, etc.
Skippy chunky gas🤤
ok im going to go play factorio
Now tell me why heavenly did not do the speech in pediment on the phone the a flame trooper
Let's go
I unironically got one of the shoulder puppets from Disneyland of the legend himself Salacious Crumb because he's just great (Also me and him share a name, I'll let you figure that part out)
yeet
Ayo could you flip the card around chief. I'm tryna buy some gamer supps.
Bananikin staring mindlessly staring through the air while a nuke blows up in the background XDDDD
WAIT BADGER IS MARRIED BUT I WANTED THAT DUMBTRUCK OF A ASS :(
Badger, you know that BF2 has mod for Pope XD I think it was for Kylo Ren
ayo bro i was there for one of the streams some of the footage was from.
What about Arc Troopers doe
Love your videos dude , i might hop on twitch one day to see
He got demonetized for shooting ewoks with a 1911. Damn, that's a violation, youtube
I knew I heard DigitalVagrant lol. Dang that rum hittin' REAL early my friend.
as a person who plays bf2 i can say it is painfully pleasant
BADGE
My stomach hurts after every video. Thank you.
Saw this on twitch. r e g r e t .
A suprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
The best belated birthday present ever
I dont know how you make me laugh my a** off EVERY SINGLE VIDEO BADGER. You make excellent content, and make people like me very happy. Keep doing what you do best you absolute based madlad.
Should we be worried about badgers addiction with solacius b crumb
Ever think of doing a Fallen Order video along the same lines considering the stuff people get up to in there? Granted it's single player, but still, I'm sure you could manage some kind of chaotic mayhem with the skins alone XD
This was great. I keep missing your streams tho.
Off topic but with the motion capture is it like VR l?
I almost wanna watch them play the original Battlefront 2 with mods.
learning that badger used to work in finance is weird🤣
We want fortnite
5:07 *HA*
Have you tried Gmod yet?
Ayo guys, real talk rn I think Badger likes Salacious B. Crumb
currently working the storms cant tell you how nice it is to sit down, relax, and watch badger
LETS FREAKIN GOOOOOOOOO
the alec baldwin part caught me off guard
Bro why has this come out when I decided to download battlefront 2?
Seriously though someone needs to sign  Alec Baldwin into faze clan
Clones are still better 😁
at 7:58 "Welcome to Team Fortress 2..."  at 8:30 "...after 9 years in development, hopefully it has been worth the wait."
Spider man got tired of the MCUniverse so he went to space to have a change of pace. (Didn't mean for this to rhyme)
EA-"We don't want to break cannon by adding a pink Darth Vader" Badger and Da Boys 5 years later with infinite possibilities and no supervision
Yes
I like how Heavenly's model went from Cacodemon to Freddy Fazbear from Fnaf security breach. Lol
I hope you survive the next civil war badger...
Mmmmmmmmm meth I mean good videos
When in doubt, bust ze flammenwerfer out.  Can't parry flames, Jedi.
NEW BADGER VIDEO LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO
Spiderman mowing down roger-roger's in a space desert with a banana-shaped neon saber that he stole from Banana-kin Funniest shit ever
My brain sometimes get a migraine from your explosions but I love it thanks for the shotgun humor.
If u decide to play Red Dead Online, all I can say is...good luck
Oh Hey, it's a Battlefront video that I CAN ACTUALLY WATCH (for now) since YouTube hasn't age restricted It yet.  Nice.
Salacious B. Crumb is the literally the best Star Wars character of all time.
Me: *sitting quietly taking a test* My phone: 16:13.
I was just telling my friend at work about your first BF2 video the other day! WTF?!
One of the undisputed kings of shitposting, nice as always Badger.
Badger you should get different skins for the sith trooper like the colors of koolaid jammers
Get Digi to introduce the Badger and his boys to an Arma operation. that would be hilarious
9:10 almost made me spit my tea. Fuckin' hell! 😂
Thx for the upload. Really makes my day especially after I fell into 49.5°F water 6-7 miles offshore while dumping crab gear. 👌
Love to see a new vid from my boi badger. It aint much but it's still good shit. You know how it be.
I clicked on this video more faster than loosing my braincells while watching it
good episode
This was hilarious amazing video :)
Holy shit, that camera switching sound gave me too strong of a nostalgia hit
There should be a mod to change that flying first order trooper into a pilot from Titanfall
Bruh I just had dinner & rolled up, and the GOAT uploads? I feel blessed
6:26 just your average stellaris run
…is this a (What If )episode
Iam under the influence of alcohol
Those hacked lobbies
I didn't realise that fucking Bannanakin got added to star wars
Damn. A welyn and a badger video back to back. Couldn’t have a better night.
I mean, the First Order troops come with Rey and Kylo Ren and all the baggage they bring.  So it balances out.  also, your usurper empire will die in flames and your Sith Lord master with it.
Another amazing episode with absurd meme and space-racism potential! Love it, thanks mate!
Lmao the Boomer death trooper again, I love it!
Hi
funniest man on the planet right here
can't wait to see darth vader slaughter ewoks as a pickle next video
I watch these as religiously as I watch star wars and Marvel Movies. I'm and Atheist
here at 69k views
I like to see you play bloons td6, it be fukn crazy.  Nuclear warfare+accient magic vs silicone rubber
Fucking epic.
Green Goblin: 0:22 Spider-Man: But you're the one getting smoked Gobby! *Japanese Spider-Man shoots Green Goblin*
Finnaly my crack has been uploaded
Oh badger you and your friends didn't ruin the star wars franchise because disney already did that themselves.
THIS IS EXACTLYYYY WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
I remember spilling my ONLY free sample guacamole gamer fart 9000 watching the stream XD thank you badger !!!
I'm so used to hearing badger's voice on some random character that when I saw his actual voice i though that was some more mo-cap shit.
This guy is literally the definition of quality over quantity.
Wow, badge is married AND ballin.
5:40 the real ending to the secuels se need but don't deserve
AND HE'S BACK
Love your vids
If only he knew about the over powered per patch commando
Picture the scene: a band of plucky space rebels on the run from an evil empire, pursued by stormtroopers who can't seem to hit the broadside of bulkhead at any sort of distance
Finallyyy
Now we know why green goblin is so green…
Love this
Dark side gang 🦅🇺🇸💥🔥
Hey Bayer can u play rainbow road to s.I. ? Or return to rainbow in general? Pls
New badger with my afternoon snack. Nice.
Exotic butters
Man I was studying for exam for tomorrow but when I saw the notification that badger dropped a video I sad Fu(k school am dropping off
BADGER TIME!!!!
NICE
halo infinte please
YOOOO
*checks sub box* badger uploaded  Me: "LETS F*CKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO"
YES
I need him to do a video on Cookie Run.
Wait, does he not know about HvV?
Moar battlefront 2 is the best gift I could of asked for
Alec Baldwin is a certified concealed carry owner
This is worf the monthly aneurysm
Ballin..... But at what cost
bananakin is funny, but still love the Pickleous Cage
HE’S HERE ONCE AGAIN TO GRACE US!
Blessed today
Like every gun in this game is fucking garbage but then you pick up the T21 and you realize that you’ve won the game.
So Glad badger found the power of moded battlefront. Just wait till he realizes that you can add basically any character from any game in the game. Even a r6 or L4d2 character.
Couldn't go to school today cause of my stomach and I'm pretty sure badger just cured me of my pestilence
Too bad he didn’t know about the private servers you can create with even more game changing mods.
Oh Yeah
Honestly didn't know Badger was married.
Bro if you use Asuka's model to represent your wife, that makes you Receding Hairline Jin Kazama, that's just the facts Badjur
17 minutes when this was upload
Fuckin hilarious
Way to go Super Star, this video made me die of cringe!
Was that the fallout new Vegas slot machine
Heavenly as Glam Freddy is somewhat comforting.  I can't explain why, and even I don't know why, so we can all agree that I am just a weird human being.
Yay! I've been waiting for badger to post a video and here it is
Making Thursdays the best day of the week sense 2010
Any chance we might get a R6 extraction vid with the crew
The trooper at the end looked like he was doing the walk you do when you shit your pants and have to go change
YES HE FINALLY UPLOADED
Gregory? I'm. I'm embracing the dark side Gregory...
Salacious crumb is cool and all but is he as cool as Droopy Mcool?
“…forget what I’m gonna say” The dementia is kicking in🤣
Hearing  heavenly say cringe as Freddy from sb fuckin kills me
In the last video skulker was the antagonist of the video. I’m glad it’s the same for this one Literally every time he shows up, he goes against everyone else and I love it. He is my favorite part of russianbadger videos
Please come back to Battlefield 1 Badger, then do Titanfall 2 to complete the trifecta of abandoned multiplayer masterpieces.
He has dementia
i am once again requesting a tf2 video
His wall be a vibrator tho
This games goated
It's still possible to kill people if everyone is stuck at 1 hp, you run them over with a vehicle, although I dont know about anything but the saber tank and the republic speeder
1:13 mg42 weilding stormtrooper......yup its badjur vid
And there tf2 we do not know how the fuck it still here but we not question it
Its good to know that if we nuke the world into oblivion, unemployment will be a record low
A banger per usual
Badge
Battlefront II’s live service support was killed so Battlefield 2042 could……    well, fall face first into the dirt.
love you badger
The mods have gone to far you can WEAR SKELETOR?     Wonder if the suit goes MYEEEEAH every time you put it on
No matter how many times I rewatched the first bit it's always funny
This is the best video ever made
There’s this one game called Plants Vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2 and it’s a really fun game and you can really mod this game
Don't worry Badger. You can't possibly do any more damage than Disney already has.
How long till yah play Clownfield 2042?
Man, you sure love that crackhead monke.
I like how at 13:59 you can see Kirby dart to the other room where maul is
YEESSSSSSSS. Time to let my brain seep through my ears.  16 minutes of enjoyment well wasted.
Bananakin skywalker
I too am quite fond of Salacious B. Crumb
The legend appears again
I like how heavenly is glamrock freddy
LETS GO NEW VIDEO
everybody gangsta until spider-man grabs the lightsaber
Next vid better be halo infinite since you be talkin so good about halo
les go
LETS GO! So glad he’s back with battlefront
i still rly dont know why they Blew Up Fucking Coruscant
Luke, I am your imposter
I have to agree with badger, clone commando and death trooper are my favorite classes to play
WOOT!!! Now, if you do Rainbow Six Extraction next, I'd love that. I think you guys would have a lot of fun with it
Come for the funny, stay for Badger saying how much he likes his friends.
You guys are making me want to play battlefront 2 again... e even though I'm a shitter at the game
I see a pattern of a character with your voice killing another character with your voice. It is funny and all but is it suicide or homicide?
….when did Crumb become famous?   And why the hell isn’t he in Book of Boba!?
I watched a bit of this live and im glad you made a video. Shits funnny
If he promotes guacamole gamer fart I'll buy it
Hilarious, congrats on your success m8!
Salacious Deez Nutz
I Hope these videos restart the battlefront community and make Dice/EA notice "Hey, lets update this game again" cmon they killed this masterpiece for BF2042 and BF5
I wish the new series ended that way would've actually had been a good ending. A dumpster fire ENDING IN FIRE
Salacious crumb terrifies me
Your too late Spider-Man, I’ve already had the police legalize embezzlement
Why do badgers characters have a 73% chance of spontaneously imploding
I see spider man but no darth venom?
Hell yeah batman
the only reason i watched any more than half way is cause i scrolled through the feed after it preloaded and saw george. anything with that beast of a man is gonna be great. even if its for half a second worth it 100%
Your too late Spider-Man, I’ve already had the police legalize embezzlement
AW YEAH BABY MY DRUG ADDICTION HAS COME BACK
Today my birthday and Badger uploads? This is a great day
Biggest surprise is that he is married. I did not think it was impossible, I just didn't think it had happened.
Therapist: it's ok, bananakin isn't real, he can't hurt you  Bananakin: 2:10
Hello
YES MORE RUSSIAN BADGER!!
Play some hero vs villains
You're married? That's kinda cringe
ketamine visual dosis
"Monkey camel"
Like can we respect that badger memeing himself with mods now?
So Current is just US version of Tinkoff bank
CRINGE 😬
That’s right, badger smoking a swisher sweet in the intro
Let’s go, love the videos

Hell yeah, over here drinking my Mtn dew voltage, mixed with Gatorade zero, and food on the way, perfect.
Thanks for the upload badger, I really needed this right now
Please play clownfield 2042, we need to watch badger play clownfield 2042
you aren't the clown, you are the entire circus.
Star Wars: Duel of Shitposts
Hanz git ze flaminverffer
I was gonna watch a GTFO gameplay, but this came up like 27 mins ago. This jumps  in front of the line
I like to think that Disney so doggedly protects star wars because they live by the axiom that if it's gonna be fucked up by someone... THEY'RE going to b e the ones to fuck it up.
LOOK IF I DON'T SEE A PIOLT FOR A SHOW THATS JUST A BUNCH OF DUMASS STORMTROOPERS TALKING ABOUT RANDOM SHIT I WILL GET ANGY
I really wonder how much money badger spends on each video.
ok so it's medicinal use only in my state. huh, cool.
I don't know why but I think badger might be a fan of Salacius B. Crumb
Absolute mad lad does it again
The effort and time going into to these videos is extraordinary
I've been looking forward to this video so much.
wooooooo 1,183th lets goooooooo
"Like my girlfriend from fortnite?"
Didn't somone skip thair uncle's stuffing into the forever box to watch your stream?
Gotta watch it before its taken down
waimbow
Let’s fucking go
Bananakin lol
Man, me and my friends pop off with sith troops. They're fantastic!
I wanna see you guys upload more Halo games
you can't hit use with the flashbang that you where an accountant.
Y'all need to play the block ops 3 campaign together, that'd be hilarious
His back
I was there for that stream
God I remember watching the stream for this, so fuckin excitedddddd❤️🎉🎉
Yes a other video to save my brain
Any day Badger uploads is a good day 😌
As someone who has seen Cringe, The Rebellion is indeed Cringe.
Guys, I think he like selacious crumb
6:41 clip this
It 's so fucking funny wtf
BOAT
Yo, Bajur pulling Asuka? Good on you, Plastic Man Also that Rust segment had me weak af
I still want to see what Badger could do on a TF2 video
only 5 mins in and theres not nearly enough Salacious B Crumb
Wait, when did Badger get married?
This is fucked up. I'm suing you for this.
To some, their youtuber posting a video is a small boost to their day.  For russian badger. It's a whole can of Gfuel levels of boost being injected into your body.
Nice
Babe wake up, Badger uploaded a new video.
BANGER AFTER BANGER AFTER BANGER THIS MAN CAN NOT BE STOPPED
B.crum more like BOAT
The return of god
>open video  >deafened instantly by explosions in opening  Yeup. That’s a Badger video
Wait BAGDER GOT A WIFE?!
Where an apex legends video
Play republic commando you nerd!!!!!!
MOAR BOOJER LETS GOOOO
I was in that stream and I realized he puts alot of work into the videos and I appreciate it
Ah yes I love my favorite star wars movie where Bannakin duels Spider man for the fate of the war, while Ray get's toasted in the forests of Vietnam by a pair or unnamed troops while Master Chief finishes the fight.  such a masterpiece
You should play with kyber because you can also play with mods and the one hp bug was fixed in it
helo bajur  also can you play dying light 2?
The Original Battlefront 2 ought to not have any limits on mods.
BADGE
Badger: "The rate of *everything* drops to 0!"  Me: _"But the Imperial K/D hits an all time peak and disease rate drops to 0, think of the positives Badger!"_
My personal rating for the empire's transition: 1. Galactic Republic, 2. First order 3. Empire
I spy with my little eye... Mandalorian alphabet!
Play tf2 and u will feel abandoned like ma dad did to me
Hold up this man is married??? Watt???
That dance at the end will never not be not unadorable (?)
Yes the sequel I’ve been waiting for.
When I finish the video: what did I just watch (rewinds to watch again)
WOOOOO BADGER
Yavin 4 is garbage. Wipe it from the Outer Rim Territories.
The 1 ho bug broke the game …
7:25 I will buy that if you invent that
gyus it’s burjer form fortntie!!!1!1!!1!1
God bless Badger, yet another banger of a video
You managed to make even the sponsoring part funny using some literally different cameras than usual
Salacious B. Crumb for president
Damn, checked YouTube before heading back from lunch. The Karens can miss me with their bullshit for the next 20 minutes.
What perfect timing!  I was just bingeing Badger videos before work!
They're not wrong tho, glassing an entire planet helps with the economy
Ray minding her own business. Badger with the flame trooper: 'Its toasty time !!'
Badger is great
Can you tell me how much you can mod without being band thanks
Badger is such a shit post and thats why I am here.
your content is too fucking funny for damn sure
30secs in there is so much chaos already idk wtf to do
Egg
Honestly love badger if I’m ever asked my favourite YouTuber there’s only one answer
I picked zanny
Darth Spider, Lord of the Web.
I was part of the stream and I asked the best starter gun at 18 and they said get help lmao
Epic video bager
Best dance at the end, that was hilarious
Yay, another near death experience due to oxygen deficiency.
just watched the twitch stream 2 hours ago didnt know he made a new one
6:40 i never laughed And repeated a scene so damn much 💀
yes the wait over
Can’t be a badger video if someone doesn’t get executed within the first minute of the video.
I wish someone made a darth Vader wearing timbs mod on so you can stomp the crap out of people
DAMMIT BADGER MAKE A FAR CRY VIDEO PLEASE. FOR THE COMMUNITY
The legend is back to do more funny shit !!
I've been anticipating this video
8:38 is my timestamp for the Alec Baldwin section. I haven't laughed that hard in weeks.
You guys remember when bajur did that battlefield bad company 2 video? (that was like the first time I saw a Badger video) It's crazy how time goes by. I love you man!
Oh good another video to re watch 70 times :)
Back at it again at BF2! WITH MODS! thats a certified hood classic
badger: puts a random explosion in the animation* everybody: oh that's poggers
Bangar video as always! Now time to wait another month 😂
I'm in the middle of class I'm trying my best not to laugh
Mah day be so shitty then boom new badger video
Salacious B crumb is my drug addicted uncle
I love how Badger makes these kinds of videos. He shows that being able to kick back and have fun with your friends is the most important thing about games.
That Alec Baldwin bit had me in actual tears, never change badge.
2:24 ahh the sound I miss that
He he bananakin Skywalker
Epic video bager
I would kill 5 people in a hostage situation just to see a whole vid of you goofing 'round with mocap just like the intro of this vid
Can't wait for the r6 extraction "review"
16:13 **inhale** ᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍᴍ

"Welcome back to another great addition of me and the homies ruining the Star Wars franchise!"  Can't fuck it up more than Disney did.
Damn Badger you really fuckin like Salacious Crumb
Showed girl Russian Badger video.  Got laid.  Literally, true story.
What is the name of the song when you are doing the signal calibration transition?
FUCK YEAH THIS MADE MY SEMESTER ALL THE BETTER
I can't believe I actually witnessed an upload :D
Fuck yeah new vid in time for brekfst
Badger has a wife??!! I guess it makes sense even Vegeta got hitched with bulma.
Shilling debit cards to teenagers and dumb adults is really gross badger
Love the video, for more enjoyment the flame trooper has a ranged attack if you hold aim and look up parrying to master lightsaber combat “like a bantha”. Good bye.
I can’t imagine what it be like if this video was like lost planet 2
Hope to see a Halo Infinite vid in the future.
26 seconds in and I know it's going To be good
Man, I can’t wait for battlefront 3 heard they were adding the little jabba rat
I just imagined Badger (a full-grown man) in a green screen suit, doin' his lil dance at the end of the video
"Meticulously kept lore and characters" Mans never seen the sequels.
Noice
Now this is great
Begun the cringe wars have
Literally bought the game last night
Fellow storm trooper get ready for storm coming
I did not ask for this but I live this and now I'm asking for more
Dude I think you need to calm down with the motion capture suite, it’s cool as hell don’t get me wrong but the entire first half of the video felt like the intro.
Would you consider playing GTFO?
Your New Vegas video will always be my favorite, but goddamn do I love your Star Wars videos.
I would love to see you explain TF2 with your meme like freinds
New Badger Video, Another decrease to my mortality rate, let's go
6:54 Warhammer 40k says:  " excuses, excuses"

Watching this video before it gets age blocked POG
Russianbadger next Spider-Man villain
The absolute god of shit Posting and making everyones day better!

Badger ya know that there are community servers now? You can use mods that change gameplay on them. Their name is Kyber if you're interested.

Pure distilled comedy, even the ads are funny as hell

Game creators: Makes a good game  Badger: *Shits all over the game by using mods*
Y'all waiting on battlefront while I'm sitting here waiting for Skyrim after Fallout NV
WAIT UR MARRIED???
Finally it’s out
someone get this man a salacious crum body pillow
Radger Rarried?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
FOR TH CRINGE EMPIRE!!!
As a Sith Trooper main, your lack of knowledge of his power angers me. Prepare to me M2’d.
When the world needed him most  He returned
yes
Bf2 2005 is the best star wars game  And To quote the emperor “with the power of the dark side, I have reduced employment to zero”
you dont understand im ACTUALLY CRYING OVER PLUG WALK
Love your vids every time!!!
I think I'm gonna play some battlefront 2 now
Cool outro badger 😂
I literally wanted him to make a new video last night
In the end, that guy in game chat got his plug walk
Another hit, superb videos, as usual.
Sleeps
I’m so happy you posted
I think this video is sponsored by Current.
Try make tf2 video
Killed by green lightsaber? Kinda cringe
Question rainbow six extraction?
My pet chicken died today😭😭😭😭😭
4:15 okay vegeta
Just like Fortnite
Me clicking onto this video: "Ah a nice break from all the problems in our world today." *Next minute* Badger gang: "WE CAN SOLVE UNEMPLOYMENT ON THE DEATHSTAR IF WE GLASS YAVIN-4!"
Poggers
Yell liberal at Spider-Man
Thats cool and all but payday 2 video when?
I got for 1 minute on a badger livestream And the first thing i heard was "why are you sniffing homeless people"
What do you mean ruining the Star Wars franchise?? Lmfao y'all are actively making it better
BADGER, AS SOON AS I BOOTED UP THIS GANE YOU UPLOADED THIS
hello, yes? based department calling.
Hey I'm actually early
Loved it!
The Alec Baldwin part was freaking insane
The thing that really gets me is the deathtrooper saying boomer
Hello there I love your channel very much from Charlie li
WAIT BADGER IS MARRIED
Woooo! Also I caught one of these streams! It was awesome!
Nice
I hope Säpo doesn't see this comment I'm gonna make a taser
When the door is closed and he's telling the enemy to open it whose on the other side🤣
I love how a bit of every episode carry’s a bit to the next one
Your a great Viedio Master
Badger at it again posting another BANGER of a video. This man never misses.
"I can make this video without going bankrupt!" He says, while wearing a $30k motion-capture suit being captured on an $20k computer.
I needed this today, haven't been having the best week but badger helps it a ton
Here's hoping for a Mordhau Video
yes, finally another battlefront 2 video!!!
It's been a long day without you my friend and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Honestly even without friends BFII still manages to be shit loads of fun despite all its issues. It really bums me out how close to a flawless game it became before EA forced DICE to drop it.
Jesus badger even with just that tiny bit of facial hair and hoody you look like such a Midwestern dad
Perfection
YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
I know its like once a month for videos but honestly the quality makes it well worth the while
Dey put da mestr khef in da bttlefrnt
why does Alec Baldwin being a death trooper make sense, canonically?
*hears about current* **cries in Canadian**
A battlefield video that isn’t age restricted or demonitized!?!?  NANI
Classic EA, letting hackers kill all their games just so they don’t have to do anything for it.
There are custom user made servers for bf2 with mod support that solve the 1hp issue
That clown theme at the end is a nice way to end this video
Fuckin Freddy fasbear sayin no
Bout time we got another star wars battlefront 2 vid pls make more
1 minute in and it's already absolutely hilarious. Badger's editing is already unmatched
If Anakin is a banana when you turn to the Lord Vader is a banana bread
Wait. Does this mean we can mod the death troopers into actual combine police officers?
LeRussianBadger video
I believe in Salacious Crumb supremacy.
We got other horde shooters, where's Vermintide 2?  You get to smack big rats with warhammers, need I say more?
Badger doesn't remember half the characters of star wars but remembers the fucking lizard monkey from return the jedi that had 10 minutes of screen time. What the actually fuck ?
Mfw bagur likes salacius crumb and not blue elephant, the best space piano artist
Me: damn I gotta a lotta shit to do today and it's already noon I should get started Badger: [releases new video] Me: 👀
2:11 *Bananakin Skywalker*
Oh don't worry badger...Disney ruined starwars long before you did
They put master chief in the Galactic empire
Badge, the franchise was already ruined long before you took your massive dump on it.  So meme as hard as you like.
why does that hairline look like it is trying to convince me he is the villain
It'd been so long since I heard scorches voice
Battlefront II VIDEO IN 2022? LETS GOOO
The amazing lord is back, it’s always worth the month wait for each new video. Love ya badger, you always make the day much better
AH YES. CONSENTRATED HAPPINESS
Damn 900 comments in 15 minutes
Packen heat like alec Baldwin needs to be a rap lyrics
I was gonna kms but this made it all better
you are truly next level. literal GOAT
you sure did pick a bad time to make another BF2 video badger KEKW. on a side not EA are apparently working on fixing the immortality and also there are modders working on making a mod for servers and stuff, like the modders did for the 2005 version of BF2 (at least that's how i'm understanding it) so hopefully it'll be done with soon
Never go into a fake gun duel with Alec Baldwin..you'll lose.. lol
Tis man hes teh mermers
This is the best birthday gift I could ask for
10:51         clearly badger hasnt played Titanfall 2
It's the guy from Russia
Do blasters have calibers?
I FELT IT IN MY BONES THAT HE RELEASED A VIDEO TODAY
I may be freezing my ass of right now but when I saw this video in my notifications I got excited and put me in a better mood.
Yes, just yes.
There's a 1 in 3.8 million percent chance that russianbadger comments or likes this

Fun fact: Kowakian monkey-lizards, also known as Kowakians, sometimes referred to as monkeys, were a race of semi-sentient reptilian creatures often used by members of the underworld as pets. Owners of Kowakians included Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Hondo Ohnaka, and Emil Graf. They were capable of using weapons such as the blaster and, in the case of Pikk Mukmuk, a pirate tank. One Kowakian became a bounty hunter and turned the Wookiee Chewbacca over to the Galactic Empire. They were related to the much larger Kowakian ape-lizard. Due to their appearance they were often mistaken for pests. Monkey-lizards were quite intelligent and capable of mimicking almost any language.  Also: “Perhaps all Kowakian monkey-lizards should be exterminated for the good of the galaxy.” -Count Dooku
YES! another battlefront video!!
huuuh weird i legit just stopped playing this game like 2minutes ago wild
SPIDERMAN!
They did not learn from left for dead

(5:45) Burn the body and sear the soul.🔥🤣
If Badger and his crew were in Rise Of Skywalker, that shit would be a 10/10 movie.
*I been waitin’ for this.*
Ruin star wars? Bold of you to assume it was not already ruined by the Disney trilogy
I think this is probably the only appropriate time to flex that I got a signed photo with Salacious Crumb's voice actor. It's my crowning achievement.
Honestly surprised he hasn't done a TF2 video
EA abandoned BF2, but not the community, they put servers without cheaters, and it's fucking enjoyable whether you use mods or not.
The king returns
Reeee
*Posted one minute ago* That's what I like to see. Now I'm sad it's over.
they gaved the master chife a futeristic mg34
This is 100% getting age restricted too Those Alec Baldwin Jokes were no where near the pocket.
Battlefront 2 is fun. Battlefront 2 with random mods that don’t fit the atmosphere is glorious.
They put the Master Chief in the Star Wars
Instead of worrying about surviving the end of the month with 5 bucks I just fix my hunger by my monthly dose of badger, if badger doesn't upload for a month I may not survive.
February is off to a good start
Is that the Russianbager bro?!
i would be still playing this if  some assholes wouldn't keep disabling death and some game modes
This video is sponsored by Salacious B Crumb

If anyone knows the Star Wars language… what does the bottom say at 0:36?
8:40 HOLY SHIT BADGER 😂😂😂
Man a tf2 video would be great
0:22 *BUT YOU’RE THE ONE GETTING SMOKED, GOBBY!!*
Ok I’m all for fun and usually find cringe funny but the Alex Baldwin joke was a bit too much and a bit too soon. The person just passed away from that not that long ago. But I’ll probably just end up getting flamed in the comments and called a buzzkill
I love how heavenly is now Freddy rather than Cacodemon
I've only been here for 30 seconds and i already got brain damage
You love to see it
Cool
Nah you don’t shoot the producer you shoot the Director
I liked and commented on this video. For The Empire!
The family meal?
Badger had to do the Drake move of mentioning how much he loves his friends
That’s “current”ly a stupid idea
Is badgers face looking a little different or is it just me?
I love Russian badger he's so funny
Badger and the boys are memes given form.
chicken sandwich, thank you for your time
Do halo CE video please
This super saiyan is HILARIOUS
Badger Fuck Yeah! Coming To Save My Dumbass Humor. Murica!
Please make a video About No Mans Sky I feel like you’d just mess it up and make it perfect with no effort XD
5:25
To say that I'm against the idea of Heavenly being Glamrock Freddy now would be an understatement  How the hell did I have more respect when he was a fuckin meatball lookin ass
i hope this is Januarys vid  i want another one I feb
Hello skedadudler
Wait, I'm blind in my left eye? *MEET THE DEMOMAN*
9:11: i didn't understand it at first but now i understand what the joke was
I was waiting for another vid to pop up in my notifications
Random guy: Hey badger you know there are mods for Battlefront 2 with Spider-Man and Crumb?  Badger: SIGN ME THE FUCK UP!
I got demonitised for executing ewoks.  You should've been monitosed
Will you ever return to siege? Or play extraction
God I love badgers battle front videos
Beans
Pog
Yes.
Bananakin
New upload lesgOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Edit: and better than ever
We're y ou
Wake up babe the Russian badger posted another schizophrenic episode
With the offical servers for battlefront 2 being fucking unplayable you're better off downloading the private servers, watch a video about it I'm not explaining it here, this is the best option and its 10x better
*breathes in*  “Hello Mar-“ Gunshot “ JESUS FUCK.”
Bananakin Skywalker
notice me bajur saan
Ea has decided to continue developing battlefield dumpster fire. Yet abandon a perfect game.
Only 11 minutes and he has 23,000 views. Its THAT good of content lol
Its drip or down in this galaxy
Favorite 2 quotes "Ca$h Money" and "sign me the *F*ck Up* "
Do you work as an animator or do you hire one? All your animations are so goddamn smooth and natural looking.
badger, whers the r6 vids? it bee so long since you uploaded one
I'VE BEEN WAITING
Hell yeah, battlefront 2
Bruh got current and it took me 3 MONTHS TO GET MY CARD
I was literally just rewatching your videos wondering when your gonna upload again ^^
Bread
Im just waiting for the tf2 video
*Nice*
8:43 no way badger said that 💀
I see a video. I see it's by the Russian badger. I hit the like button. Literally neuron activation.
SHITHEAD WARS BATTLEFRONT II: The Idiot empire strikes back
8:43 “Packing heat like Alec Baldwin”  Fuck 😂😂
This video is sponsored by Salacious Crumb
I had stuff I needed to get done........buuuuuttttt looks like I'm watching this for roughly the next 20 minutes
Okay, this video has a Knight kicking Rey back to her desert planet. This video is already better than the new trilogy of films
This comment was made when the coments were 699
Best part was the “Heavenly are you ok”
I mean… you could just play on the private community ran servers…
bean
Packing heat like alec Baldwin 😂😂😂😂
Oh yeah, an Alec Baldwin joke? He’s really going condom off on this video.
If they allowed badger and his friends make a star wars movie, it would probably be the worst thing ever or the most based thing ever, like i can't wait for them to explode a planet just to destroy unemployment.
Ye
I would like you to try PVZGW2 cause it's a lot of fun with online
"you can't just  G L A S S  a planet and say you did it to solve the unemployment problem" - Badger 2022
Salacious B. Crumb is a war-hero with a Purple Heart, put some respect on his name. Why do you think he’s allowed to be so close to Jabba? He’s his greatest bodyguard.
I hate my nefue now he called my stormtrooper helmet I got “helmet from fortnite” and I wanted to hurt him so bad bro
Certified hood classic
This video is so well done 😭🔥
HOLY SHIT BADGER POSTED A VID
PRAISE JESUS, HE'S UPLOADED
One day badger will have a video without a gun in it and that's a world I'm not ready for.
Russian badger ruin the star wars game   EA: I have been summoned
Every month = funny badge video I need more ideas.
I just wanna see a russianbadger pavlov vid now
HEAD EMPTY ONLY BULLET 🤣🤣🤣
1:20 AYO?!
BATTLEFRONT 2 VID LEZZZZ GO
Ah, a video I can watch while I have my brain off.
It would be great if the game wouldn't be broken on PC
I just woke up I see this
When we thought a Battlefront II video couldn't get any crazier this mf adds Spiderman from fortnite into the mix
Badger play on kyber for custom servers and you can mod it to heck
And here I was upset about going to work. Now I get to be in a better mood before work. Thank you good sir.
F for the fallout videos that both got age restricted
I was literally just thinking "man I'm bored I've got nothing to watch" then boom, badger video
I would like to see Russian Badger and his buddies in a Star Wars movie.
1:08 Like if Disney didn't already ruined it. But I don't blame Badger, we all agreed that the sequels never existed in the first place.
This man makes me laugh so much it’s funny
Crumb should be Yoda
fuck yes
When tf is this guy going to play Titanfall 2?
Great work, that $30k + set up is worth it!
Hey russianbadger why aren't you playing battlefield 2042? :) what didn't met expectations? I thought you said this was just another battlefield game that everything was going to be alright...yeah that quote aged better then milk that has been left in the fucking desert for 2 years. Welp i hope your happy defending that pile of garbage because battlefield 2042 is dead and puts the franchise as a whole at risk now.
YES MORE STBF2
Oh shit we got a banger upload
I was wondering if he was gonna mention the immortality bug, I’m glad to know I’m not the only one experiencing it all the time
The weapon mods for this game are epic and so are you badger
So Heavenly is just Glamrock Freddy now?
Hay are you going to review Total War Warhammer 3, like you did for Total War Warhammer 2?
lets see how long it takes for this one to be age restricted
Let's goooooooooo
4.3k Upvotes and 3 downvotes of the time of watching... DAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam thats a good ratio!
I’ve been looking forward to this
I’d much rather watch the version of the version of the new Star Wars trilogy where Rey gets torched by a rando
Our lord and savior badger has returned POOOOOOG Edit: bananakin skywalker is canon change my mind

Salacious B. Crumb's popularity about to explode like the Death Star now.
Disney and Lucasfilm already fuck up the star war universe
I can see badger wasn’t sponsored by KEEPS.
Salacus crumb the main character of Star Wars
4:54 i never heard badger scream like this

You ever just sit down with a delicious salad and refresh YouTube at the moment badger upload is just *chefs kiss*
Salacious B. Crumb for President   Join The Truth
What if they added random crits to this game just because EA hates this game
I literally quote the previous battlefront video frequently. Can’t wait to see what this one has in store.

Again, only certain YouTubers can make ads worth it and hilarious. What a man
firts bajur video of 2022 lets go!
Russian ballin
How does it feel to be the first crying seal to turn Anikin skywalker into bannakin
Battlefront II mods is a better crossover event than No Way Home, don’t change my mind.
I like how almost all of Badger's videos have a Sponsor.
I can’t tell if Badger repairs or destroys my mental health
My bunghole smells the way Jabba the Hutt looks.
BF2 so good I bought it twice so I could have it on PC
Why did the phone type kinda sound like tequila?
Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity. And men assumed a fleeting form. These are the roots of our world. Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite... A lie will remain a lie.Young Hollow, knowing this, do you still desire peace
Bro and his friends are so funny man 😂😂 wish my friends where like this 🤦🏾‍♂️.
its a good day when badger uploads
The animations get better and better with each video
I'm British and its 8'oclock.. perfect timing

Oh god... I was wondering when they'd get around to modding Battlefront. After Left 4 Dead, I knew it was coming, and there's some wild shit on there.
Nice
Sees Russian badger  Smacks lips Furiously cklis My phone screen  Phone is broken but it is all worth it all
FYI there are custom servers also made by the modding community that you can use ANY mod on. YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE CHAOS THE MODDERS PROVIDE

Keep up the good work, and thanks again Edit: I HAVE RECOVERED!
So how bout a cursed halo video?

Hey, don't worry; Disney ruined it more than you ever could.

Seeing Spider Man with a lightsaber is like Yoda with an M16.
Epic, another Star Wars Video that hopefully won't get demonitized and age restricted.
I really should give this game another try... it can't be any worst than Battlefield 2042.
Where AK Guy collab?
Never have I ever clicked on a video so fast
I may have fucked up my knee but at least badger uploaded today
Video just dropped for me, no regrets.
Can't ruin star wars if they did it themselves
I saw this on twitch for two seconds and it was cursed but you still deleivered
Mother wake up, the YouTuber called Russianbadger has uploaded yet another 20-ish minute shitpost
