This is what our kids sing about killing one another, bitches and hoes, etc absolutely 🗑️. Speak about getting an education and being productive human beings , songs that have life. Yeah you can get rich singing about bitches, hoes and capn niggas. But remember what does it profit a man to gain the whole world 🌎 but lose his sou! Make u go 🤔

Talon older brother got shot in the hip and all them people alive in ward 8 deal and work for him I ran them from the sour

🗣️ “my youngans killas too!” 3:32
Gawd damn 🔥🔥🔥🚬
Crazy they all signed to a white man's label but they be the first to diss on the white men in the game. Crazy it's almost like they're hypocrites or something. Don't want to be judged and stereotyped but then make videos waving guns and drugs like they're props or something. Baffles me these boys got millions for singing  about the crimes they commit then call the homies snitches and rats.
This beat gets me every time 😩
Last ones left 🔥🔥
This shit bananas‼️‼️‼️‼️
"Put some blood on all that blue"👌🏾
This song gives me 2007 vibes… good times for me lol

EST really had it out for shorty with that first line. Also the bass in this song doesn’t get talked about enough 🔥
the youngins are screwed.   this is the popular music now?   all about killing.       it used to be " the environment made people kill and get back for their loved one."     well not anymore.   its considered cool to shoot and kill people now?        america please wake up  .    your people are not "your people" just because they have the same skin color.

LATINOS FOR TRUMP 😆 WE DON'T TRUST YOU
POT FARMER DANCE SONG $$ I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack  After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet  Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

Never really listened to ES or Dugg but this joint slappin! The beat is nuts!!!!!

I just wanna know where the producer was spiritually when they made this banger cold ass beat
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.

Every sin you commit is not your fault. You have to blame it on the Sin Family, "The Seven Deadly Sins" because, they are the ones channeling there Satanic energy into your spirit and, Satan is prowling around like a Lion, looking for someone to devour. That means his children the 7 Deadly Sins, that Satan has authority over because, this is there Earth, given to them by God in Heaven. Are to blame! Do not blame yourself "Child Of God! When Jesus aske you on your Judgement day why did you do this sin. To be clean repent for all your sins in Jesus name Amen and, blame your sin on Satan because, he came to this Earth first. Then blame the 7 deadly sins because, they are with Satan, that is there God, so they must follow his Satanic orders. So really guilt all guilt for your sins is just you forgetting it's Satan's Earth, Satan's fault because he is the God of all evil. Bible, perfect literature I tell you my brothers. As long as you are written in the book of Life you are! Saved! You are God's Earth Star because, he is watching you like a movie. Don't forget the Antichrist's are infinite, till the end of the world. So if a person does not confess Jesus Christ as there Lord and, saviour you are channeling there Satanic energy, so blame the Antichrist for your sins as well you are a "Child of God" you are blameless by the blood of Jesus. So no more guilt!
Damn bro💀🔥🔥🔥

Dugg a pedo. I don’t care what you think
Folks let’s not be ignorant fools, now is the time to REPENT or (CHANGE) from doing all of our sins be cleansed and walk in faith reading, doing, and guarding; the commandments, feast days, and sabbaths of the most high (AHAYAH) the “I AM” in his true name and power in the name of the only begotten (YAHSHAI). Whether you know it or not he’s COMING for ALL who are HIS, Don’t be a FOOL!!!? and accept the governments god (lucifer), Their false messiah and false system they are setting up right before you’re eyes. All it takes is a lil research and you’ll find out what’s going on while they distract folks with this planned man made virus, movies, sports, social media, games, music, and other sources of entertainment. Just look at their shows, music, movies, games and other rituals they perform while people pay to watch or play. Be a fool if you want to but if you read this you can’t say you weren’t warned bout it so🤷🏾‍♂️ Go search up what those fake satanic Jewish Kabbalah leaders running Israel are trying to do right now or what your elite government has planned for this country and the rest of the world or you don’t care. 🤦🏾‍♂️ They are literally working out the end times right before us, while spoon feeding the world to accept their matrix system and maitreya (false spiritually woke messiah), but aye the most high said there will be scoffers unrepentant and even unbelievers during the end times who wouldn’t care until it’s to late, Because they got their head stuck in this world, “such foolishness”🤦🏾‍♂️. Man pick up your faith and actually see this thing thru and fight the good fight but ima end this off with this. EVERYDAY READ HIS 10 (COMMANDMENTS) find them in (exodus Ch 20) Worship the FATHER (AHAYAH ASHER AHAYAH) the great “I AM” Accept your SAVIOR HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THE WORD IN THE FLESH (YAHSHAI) CELEBRATE his (FEAST DAYS) FASTING and giving alms.  Last but not least HONOR his TRUE SHABBAT or SABBATH which goes according to the lunar calendar moon cycles.  Oh and dive in the word and actually stop sinning and watch the change take place in your soul and spirit trust me you’ll look at life differently cause you’ll be called out of the lies and wickedness of this earth. THAT IS ALL FOLKS. SHABBAT SHALOM🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🤷🏾‍♂️

shit to hard
Witness: Killing on Demand  Professor Martin Elliott at the hearing on November 29  Martin Elliott, MD FRCS, professor emeritus of cardiothoracic surgery at University College London (UCL), is a member of the China Tribunal. He explained at the hearing some of the evidence that has been evaluated by the Tribunal, including that the number of organ transplants far exceeded the organ donations, the unexplained physical examinations conducted at labor camps, and the short wait times for organ transplants.  Based on scientific publications, hospital websites, and other resources, Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas estimated that organ transplants in China ranged between 60,000 and 90,000 per year, a number much higher than the number of organ donations claimed by China. This discrepancy indicates the existence of a hidden organ donor bank.  In addition, detainees were required to have blood tests and organ ultrasound tests for no apparent reason. Some of the detainees also went missing from labor camps and other detention facilities. Given how these detainees were tortured, it is hard to imagine that such tests were for their health. Furthermore, these blood and ultrasound tests were not documented in routine procedures.  Consistent with the evidence listed above are the short wait times for organs. In most European countries the wait times are usually months or even up to two years. But data showed that wait times in China are often as short as a few days. This can only be explained by a hidden organ donor bank.  Citing calculations from independent journalist Ethan Gutmann, Sir Geoffrey said that each human with usable organs could generate a profit of between $500,000 and $750,000.  Elliott further explained that this is a business model of on-demand supply. In one case, a Japanese citizen needed a new liver and was willing to pay $5 million for it through an agent. The agent contacted a hospital in China and secured a transplant facility in a short time with the organ needed. Sometimes, spare organs were also available. Such a business model is unimaginable in Western countries.  He emphasized that when talking about China, he was referring to the CCP and its policies, not Chinese citizens.

This go so hard on so many levels
This shit so hard PAUSE
Let it be known to ALL today. That JESUS CHRIST is the ONLY way to HEAVEN, to receive ETERNAL LIFE. Salvation is found in NO OTHER (Acts 4:12). That means Religion cannot save you, your "good deeds" cannot save you, your religious figures cannot save you, your idols, and charms cannot save you. JESUS made it clear, that HE is the only way to HEAVEN (John 14:6) Dont believe the lie that people tell you that JESUS was "just a man" "just a prophet" He was MUCH MORE. you tell me which "man" or "prophet" rose from the DEAD?? you will never. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN!!!!! (John 3:3 1 Peter 1:23 1 John 5:1). The Bible says in PHILIPPIANS 2:10-11 that at the NAME of JESUS CHRIST EVERY KNEE WILL BOW and EVERY TONGUE WILL CONFESS THAT HE is LORD.  Do NOT reject the FREE gift of GOD, which is Eternal life and salvation through His SON JESUS. There is a place GOD has prepared for those who choose to REJECT his SON. and that place is where the devil and his angels will be TORMENTED forever in The LAKE OF FIRE/HELL, because it was prepared for them (Matthew 25:41) (Revelation 20:10) GOD didn't make HELL for you, but if you REJECT JESUS you will end up there.  "If you CONFESS with your MOUTH the LORD JESUS, and BELIEVE in your HEART that GOD has RAISED HIM from the dead, YE SHALL BE SAVED. - Romans 10:9

10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. It's been Monday all week. 2. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours.  3. Atheism is a non-prophet organization. 4. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.   5. Ask me about my vow of silence. 6. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 7. What happens if you get scared half to death twice? 8. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 9. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries. 10. All generalizations are false.   Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

1 Peter 5:8-9 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion  looking for someone to devour. 9 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Free dem boy We dem ..
Too All the Artists Out There I Pray We All Succeed 🙏💪🏽💰 Y’all Keep Grinding 💯
Jesus is coming soon!  Please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.

Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥 repent of your sins . There is forgiveness  only in  Jesus Christ, no other name is given under heaven that man may be saved. He  died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  God commands every man to repent and  beleive the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Flee eternal hell🔥.  He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺👂⏰🗣️ The way is narrow and difficult the way. Enter you at the straight gate. If you say you are a Christian but are living like an unbeliever or a devil. You more than likely are not one , you are deceiving your self and other. But there is grace to the one who comes to God through Jesus Christ 🙏🏼.  It will be the end of your self will  and sinful passions, but at the end is eternal life.  There is no sin that Jesus Christ can't deliver you from. So go to him and quit hiding your sins , tell him, repent of them and turn from them.It says beleive the good news  and repent .  He did it with me the chief of sinners. Now I am walking in victory by grace☝🏿☝️ alone⛪❤️....

Wow.... That was so.... BAD! Congratulations on the paint by numbers rap video guys. Just about all of the standard rap video cliches were fit into the first 30 seconds I watched before I had to turn it off due to my ears bleeding. I actually forgot it was called Thump Shit, and was hearing them say Dumb Shit, which is more fitting. I cant stand these kind of rappers. Completely unoriginal. It just turns my stomach when I see these ignorant "rappers" who feel the need to spend their first signs of money on ridiculous amounts of jewelry. And guys, what's up with the holding up of imaginary guns in videos? 😂

Psalm 5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.  Psalm 55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

3 Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
