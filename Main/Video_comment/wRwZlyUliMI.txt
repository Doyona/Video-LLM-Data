Cmon guys🤣🤣 how come I'm just seeing this
0:18 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now Fabinho,Gomez and Trent are injured 😅😳.Matip always injured this Liverpool team is curse. Dean definitely a Man City fan 😆. He predict that the whole defense of Liverpool will be injured 😅
English football is stupid. Especially after pickford attack
R
Van Dijk got what he deserved for setting up a howler in the 18/19 season
Age is just a number.
Everyone talking about Liverpool and Van dijk me over here looking at Pickford's Baby hands 👀
Tbh the last one makes the most sense
BOOM! 😂
LFC v AJAX 1-0!
This one's a classic! Klopp beating up Ramos's red card and JK 2.0! 🤣
RAMOS
Play adrian in midfield to replace fabiano who plays their defense leta be honest Adrian's passing is amazing
Sign Pickford as CB, he really tackles well
No red card on offside is hilarious...It would have led to a yard fight in a school but in Premier league, its ok..lol
*5 WAYS TO REPLACE VAN DIJK AT LIVERPOOL* 1. Emergency Signing (0:07) 2. Use the squad (0:36) 3. Painkillers (1:40) 4. Emergency Centre-Back (2:26) 5. Operation Anfield execution (2:52)
Now it’s Fabinho
Who do you think should replace Virgil? https://youtu.be/88qWkvCk9RA
Honestly i'd love to see Klopp as a Center Back for like one Game just for the Fun 😂
jkparty
Everyone at the end: "Boom!" Jürgen Klopp: "Stop copying meee"
They cant
Who’s here after Ajax actually beat a team 13-0
I thought this was 442oons
This is hilarious 😂
Sign David Luiz        or Phil Jones MUUUUUH
BOOM
I like how in 1:16 and 2:50 when Jurgen klopp hates Jurgen klopp 2.0 that was funny.
Who's here after Ajax actually won a game by 13 goals
Idk why is there not operstion get Dejan Lovren back
Plot twist we win
The Ramos one was the best😂😂😂
Top of the league 💙 Too late thinking about small squads now, neighbour..🙂
This is really funny 😂
I really love Ramos and James
3:14 lol
Nice video
Replace him by Fabinho or Sergio
I love when the red card falls and allison still catches it
It’s just the dark arts
Ramos🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
I will go for harry kane
RIP Virgil
useless ramos
or just sign dejan lovren
Matip injured by leaf😂😂
Who tf is the klopp 2.0?
That's way funny
Where's the 6th way dejan lovren
the best part in my opinion was the ending
Klopp played striker, not CB
Emagine Liverpool searching replacements for Van Dijk and then this pops up.
Its funny how ajax didnt even win
Stupid idea's only☎💥https://youtu.be/T90BnUwYt7Y
gini at CB
Hold Hold  Wait for the offside flag  Attack ...... VAR check possible red card Check complete No red card, offside 😂😂😂

2.55   Exercise can sometimes turn into execution
There is no way to replace van dijk  well on less we buy Laporte
😂😂😂This is actually too good lol
Use magic legs
Sign upemacano
Dean is a Man City fan is CONFIRMED.   Since Van Dijk got injured, he made like 5 videos about it.
The best part way to replace Van Dijk is to get the best defender in the world back AKA Dejan Lovren
Neck massage 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bring the Roy keane show back so  VVD can talk about life being injured
#5 LMAO
I'm on the floor hahaha From a liverpool fan

KAGS
Look guys I think Rhys Williams is the best option right now. the Guy is good and also he proved it in how he played in our last Carabao cup match. And he also commands the back line well to
Peotor Chech has been registered for Chelsea PL Squad this season.So,why not Liverpool did something like it too???(Maybe Steven Gerard as CM while Fabinho plays as CB)😋😋😋😎👌
Can I go kick trump's ass and tell the secret service that melania was offside?
Why does klopps assistant look like a blonde David Wagner
If anyone is wondering, the second jurgen klopp’s name is andreas kornmayer, he is the fitness coach for liverpool and he doesn’t look like klopp anymore
I can't stop laughing
Lol the bits with Kornmayer are my favourite
VAR check, Offside, No red card. Boom
BOOM! my favorite moment lol
Ramos
I was expecting a penalty to Manchester United at the end
The 5th Way is Lit 🔥😂😂😂
Sule whit a Virgil mask
Ask to get dejan lovren back the best defender
I loved the last plan, injure opponent best player when he is offside. Ingenious...😂😂😂😂😂😂
653th comment
442Toons' Jürgen Klopp is the funniest shit on that whole miniverse. I still crack up every time I watch the 10 Things about Lewa: "THEN WHY DID YOU GO ON A FREE TO OUR BIGGEST RIVALS YOU SON OF A BITCH".
I was very impressed about the whole video but the fifth was fascinating.
bring Lord Pique
Without Van Dijk. Liverpool are Chelsea
Stupid pickford
2:39    3:10
he really died ???
Hello btec 442oons
0:58 The fact that Matip is injured again  after playing  just one game after 7 months makes this video more funnier
I  like
thank you pickford
Wait,wait "attack red card,var check offside,no ref card"🤣🤣
Perfect replacements🤣🤣
Van Dijk looks different
The last one is hilarious
operation Anfield exexution is not a bad idea.. just saying.. lmao
or play van den berg
Debruyne is already out.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why can't they just deploy Firmino? World's best defensive striker
Var complete offside no red card 😂
0:16 Ramos joins LFC 🤣🤣🤣 2:41 Klopp plays for LFC 😅
6th way to replace VanDijk :-  Buy a BUS🚌
The last one though 😂 😂
How come kloop got the number 53
The last one was hilarious.
Lol offside no red cards got me
Why not clone Virgil van Dijk?
Andreas Kornmayer trying so hard to be Klopp 😂
Get Dejan Back 🤣
He's not good so any one can replace him
This was one of 442oons's best
haha
I LOVE the last 3.💥💥💥
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Liverpool robbed
I was dying at the last one!🤣
0:21 sadio what hell
Shoot, they’re gonna attack Bruno
Wait for the offside flag 😀😀😀😀😅
Tbf Rhys Williams looked really good when he played next to VVD maybe chuck him in
Get dejan back
They could simply get Dejan Lovren back.
Demiral would be perfect for us. But Juve won't sell him😥
De ligt please take him
Hasn’t anyone else noticed that there is no black referees
1:00
Im not first Im not last But most importantly Nobody asked
If you are offside, you can kill everyone! You’ll never get a red card!
Operation Anfield Exercise 🤣🤣
What the hell sergio finished me🤣😂😂
Sign their rivals cb kind of VINCENT KOMPANY
No 6. Sign David Moyes as Emergency Manager
Klopp played CB?
Wait for the offside flag attack had me dying ahahhahaha
Klopp's duplicating "Neck massage" at 2:19 :O
I’m a mentality monster 😂😂😂
Over-rated player media man
...
Does everyone realise Liverpool are currently the top of the “most conceded goals league” and that was With Virgil Van Dijk
Sep van de berg
Sign Franz Rudigauer. He is German like Klopp and unwanted!
Who cares about ansu fati
A bonus to option 1. Get a Ramos and Pepe duo
442oons outdid themselves on this one😂👏😂👏😂👏😂😂
they should buy kyle walker and play him as gk and play adrian at cb
Where is Sakho?
Its in! Ajax leads 12-0.......... ........ After 5 minutes)))))
No red card. Offside
I think Ramos could work and also Klopp didn't get angry when the Liverpool players copied him
its so sad that we scousers have needed 2 of these videos in just 1 week literally 6 ways to replace alisson says 1 week ago
Not gonna lie they had us in the first half.
“Gomez is playing like peak lovren “😂
Virgil van dijk is irreplaceable
LORD RAGNAR KLAVAN
Kaulipohy from Napoli
Tbh option 5 will give a punishment     Red card to the person that was offside
They didn't include Chelsea or Arsenal's best players     Oh wait...
Time travel and kill Pickford
3:10 it should be lingardinho
Bring back Dejan Lovren
The last minute are amazing lol
Sometimes I can't think of words to describe your work, great vid man😂😂😂👍🏻
U can just ask Jamie carkcer to come on the pitch

Get Dirk Kuytwoman out of retirement to do the honours on VAR-officials in Liverpool games
Jordan pickford was my man of the match it does my head in all the Liverpool fans moaning over a fair challange it's not pickfords fault vandykes legs are like jelly 😂😂
Special pain killers vs ajax hahaha rip vvd
Jürgen is in my top 5 favorite characters in the 442oons line-up.
That wait for offside thing was funny
lmao kdb is already injured and city can cope with playing bernado at cb, cancelo at cam, mahrez at rm
age is just an answer
🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
Best idea:(possibly cheap )  Sign Van Dijk's Brother  He is a bodyguard 💪 He can guard weak Adian I suppose in the goal😂
Sign Wendie Renard from OL 🤣 She kinda looks like VVD
0:24 Who else misses that song Mo Salah Mo Salah Mo Salaaaa running down the wing
They can easily go with a 3-4-3.
Check complete no red card 😂😂
Koulibaly
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 0:15, 0:20, 0:23, 0:27
Get to the choppa!
😂😂
*magic brownies*
Who is klopp’s assistant?
Only if they had the magicshion countiano then he could have healed him right up 1😀
Simione would be proud of the last tactic
Liverpool are f***ed without VVD  ! oh wait they still have Gomez 😊
Ok losing alisson was obviously a big problem but now with VVD gone wtf will we do
Рамос всегда по умолчанию за Реал.
They can use Adrian I don’t think he can do worse at cb
seriously the red card is the most annoying character on 442oons
❤ Keep this up
#1 call maldini and tell him to play until  van dink is better
They should buy back loveren
1:00 that leaf should be banned for life for that horrific tackle
The last part is sooo true we should injure other teams best players as well after offside flag
WAIT FOR THE OFFSIDE FLAG, I died laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Harry maguire
Sign david luis 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Play Adrian at CB! Or just don't play any defenders
Geez,even Van Dijk in a wheel chair is still better than Joe Gomez,Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren combined
Who's that Klopp clone ?
hahaha the last one is the best one.
It's damn funny... 😂😂
Lol
Poner también los subtítulos en español
4)"Age is just a number, I'm a mentality  monster"😂😂😂😂😂😂  5)"Hold wait for the offside flag, Attack"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm finished
That last one thou 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm dead laughing
Liverpool always. They have done everything they can ❤️. Van Dijk will come back stronger 🙏🏽
3 vids just about vvd and they say dean isn't a liverpool fan
Honestly this one is a piece of art. Hilarious all the way 😂
I say that we play bobby as a center back, 😂😂
October injury regime was reserved for man utd Liverpool - allow me to introduce
Matip haha
Too easy - sign Raheem Sterling. He has good clearances
0:31 😂😂😂😂😂
I have to admit..,anfield execution idea is not bad at all. Surely VAR will miss that 🤔
I'll be honest, option 5 doesn't seem that bad
Van den berg give him more playtime so he becomes the next van dijk
How about Pique?😂
Bring back škrtel!!!
VAR epitomes everything wrong with tech. being overused.
“Wait for the offside flag” 🤣🤣🤣
Thought Lovren will appear in this video.
lollll
I lost it after seeing the 5th way
They should play Sepp van den Berg
Sign Lovren back  Oh wait, injured Van Dijk is still better.
Bobby for CB
I wonder how Liverpool will cope without having Van Dijk in defense and Allison in goal
Nice Video
Yes I want van disk to be injured so Man Utd could beat them
Does anyone notice that it changes from exercise to execution at 2:52
#6 Sign Phil Jones. #7 Sign Dejan Lovren. #8 Sign David Luiz. #9 Sign Mustafi.
Sign lovren back lol
Only dejan loveren will be in if he was his skill in 2015 in the Europa league semi finals
Yall always make the best YouTube videos
Matip getting injured is the best thing I have seen on this channel.
What other ideas do you have? Stupid ideas only!
Ajax lead 12 nil after 5 minutes 😂😂
Liverpool RIP.⚰
If liverpool have enough money, they can buy a decent CB that can help them survive, and when VVD returns Liverpool will have a fantatic Defence!
Signing upamecano or koulybaily
If Liverpool could hold on till January they could just loan Phil jones
Phil Jones is the best replacement for VVD. Both are the same😂😂😂
Ramos part was so good.
Forreal tho if I’m a striker and I get called for offside but the defender slides in w a shit tackle, they cant be booked?
Use the world's best deffender        Dejan Lovren😂😂
Two words    Dejan lovern
If coaches could play as players ole would come in and score in fergie time
I wonder are they going to get bounty reward for injuring the players?
3:11 "wait for the offside flag" ... that's funny 🤣🤣
Offside no red card -Jurgen Kloop,2020 😂😂
Announce jamie carrager
No. 6: Sign Andreas Christensen
That emergency centre-back option should've been the last one. Nothing better than shouts of  "Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" to be the final touch😛

I'm laughing and crying at the same time
0:14-0:28, VAMOSSSS! Never gets old.
What about the GOAT, Lovren
what's with the Austrian accent?  He's from Stuttgart...   Good try at a 'meme', boys.  Still probably doing better than your manager/team.
Milner is a darling 😘😘
Boom
Just put Fabinho and joe Gomes simple as pie
Apparently david coote did not know he could recommend a red car to michael oliver 👀

Р
A video about Mesut Özil. He wasn't considered in the Arsenal 25 man list of the Premier League
I feel sad for Jugen klopp
The last one
Anyway Virgil was shit this season
Last week: How to replace Alisson This week: How to replace van dijk Next week: How to replace Salah?
All jokes aside This is what Liverpool should do. Play Fabinho and Matip/Gomez at CB and put Wignaldum in Fabinhos place  in Midfield
Liverpool need the world best defender in the world.     Pill Jones
the last one is class, 😂😂
Use The Mourinho tactit score one gol anda waith 90 minutos
Guys, I know how to replace Virgil.     *Resign Klavan*
Everyone talking about Liverpool and Van dijk me over here looking at Pickford's Baby hands 👀
So it's okay to potentially break your opponent's knee as long as they are in offside position? Good to know
“Wait for the offside! Var check complete no red card offside” 😂 hahaha
Option 6: give villa the title
Hi iam barca fan, Liverpool die
You Just killed it man 🤣🤣🤣@onefootball
Apart from the fact Ramos is also injured after Cadiz
Liverpool aren't gonna win the league now
Number 5.... VAR is not that quick
this early comment section really makes me think about the human race's knowledge
Lol this is funny I love it.
Poli
Nice vid Who else thinks 442oons needs subtitles
No. 6) Sign Phil Jones as an emergency signing
Up the villa
Ramos only signed for Liverpool because Liverpool's uniform reminds him of a red card
Im happy hes injured
I never was so early
Buy busquets as cb
Van Dijk is irreplaceable.
Fun fact Milner has played cb before
Thx for following my video idea keep up the great content👏🏾👏🏾
I guess we could get Dejan lovren back as the Best CB and we already have ADRIAN as the Best GK. Adrian more like MADRIAN😂😂😂😂
