idiot
Armpit hair on women is so gross lol
I couldn't watch to the end. Were we supposed to want these awful people to die?
“Your parents are upper middle class 💁🏻‍♀️” “No they’re not.”  “Jordan😅 yes they are. They teach at a university.” “It’s public…”
0:25 crazy tattoos
I wish this movie involve more hurricane and less shrill females.
J’ai jamais j’ai un film aussi nul. Au final y’a aucun tueurs 😂😂😂
Pete Davidson always in there.
Agatha Christie for Gen Z.... And with a very Gen Z twist. It was actually a great movie. I loved it, very clever satire.
LOOOLLL fun movie to watch,, theyre all so stupid n obnoxious!!!!! I like it
"yOu ArE sWaLLoWiNg"😧
the cuts and the millennial liberal therapy speak THIS WAS TOO GOOOOOD
I hated all these characters but I think I was supposed to.
Are all the annoying, cringe, woke modern movies we get these days satirical?  Or just this one?
Don't think I'll be watching this garbage, full of pissed up immature annoying prats no thanks.
Saw this for the 1st time today and all I can say is.......A Middle Schooler would've written a better script than this
The trailer was so much better than the movie, sad to say.
The characters are vile. Can't watch them.
featuring Olivia Rodrigo
Damn, I know it's supposed to be horror but damn this is hilarious.
fxxking Pete WHAHAHAHA
this movie is so bad. stupid ending. so annoying
Movie was 🗑
The gal with the dreads is so freakin' FINE!  I'm watching it right now. I have just under 1 hour to go.
the trailer lowkey gives me its whats inside vibes
I only watch this movie for Pete Davidson. I don’t care about the lesbians you could’ve made them lesbians and not shown the scenes.
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
This will be a good movie
I want to watch this but I hate Pete Davidson.
This shit cringe and I hate it
I loved this movie!!!
I personally did not care for this movie. It was boring.
This looks horrible
Gen Xer here, I loved this movie. I watched it twice. This will go down as a cult classic.
This movie suuuuuucked.
I have reception:)))lmao, if only they did:))
7/10 it’s ok 😅
I’m watching it now
I wasn’t expecting Pete Davidson to be in this lol
Can't believe they have the feelings is facts arguments in this movie.
Why is there a 50 year old dude hanging with goofball teenagers?
I can tell from just watching this trailer that I do not care what happens to anyone in the film.
As someone who hated Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13th, this movie is an appealing experience.
This movie was fucking atrocious. Not funny. Not scary. Not interesting. Super unlikable characters. Just awful.
I just watched this.  Never heard of most of the people in this but it's very well acted, directed. Can't figure it out until the very end.  Good movie.
saw this movie being recommended for having a plot twist that you can't guess. this movie i'll rate 5/10. dumb, slightly okay-ish. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone i know. the kissing scenes are superb though.
I just saw this on Netflix. It is the kind of movie that you watch once, and once you know the twist, you have to watch it again to see what is REALLY going on. (Like "Get Out")
The girls in this movie are so dumb
This movie is about Girls and their monthly Periods.
boDİES
This was a remarkable horror movie. I've never seen anything quite like it.
Lee Pace has no business being in such a crap movie
seems like a waiste of time watching this....
I have watched this movie at 7:12 pm today
gotta watch this asapppp
Are we gonna ignore the Fact that “BEE” killed a man!!!!!!!   She needs to go to jail 😂
this was painfully stupid to watch.
Turn this trash off Thia movie suck  🗑️
WHAT A WASTE I regret watching it!!
Stupidest Movie EVERRR🤮🤮🤮🤮
That.....ending....holy shit, watch it! 🤯
spoiler                  movie is based on a fucking trend, led to a misunderstanding led to a crazed back to back accidental killing spree
All on netflix  1. Bodies Bodies Bodies 2.Bodies 3. 3 Body Problem
Worst movie ever
This movie was horrible
This is so so so much better than “I know what you did last summer” & other 90’s and 00’s young person slasher films.   The “subtle” humor was hilarious. Literally almost every line is a punchline once it gets going. Super creatively done.
I'm so glad I didn't see the trailer before watching, I love this movie
THE 2ND STUPIDEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE😢😢😢 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME
God this movie was the funniest shit I’ve ever seen… that ending had me cackling
Genuinely wanted to love this movie, but it was really hard to like any of the characters. XD  The only one I truly enjoyed seeing on screen was Greg and he was a freaking hilarious himbo.
Rachel sennott best acting was in this movie 😂😂😂😂 I loved her
Just watched this today! Love this movie, great one 🩷
Omg!!! This movie was different fr about half way through I figured it out but it’s definitely worth a watch!!!
Dumb
so much potential yet it SUCKEDDDD!.
your worst movie yet. don't waste your time with this one.
This was good.The ending 😅.All of that because they misunderstood who did what🤦‍♂️
I watched this yesterday. The ending left me speechless.
This movie was funny as hell.😭
Just watched it. Great movie. Definitely recommend.
I could barely get through the opening scene. No offense to same sex oriented people, but I don’t want to see all that.. it was very cringy. Every character annoyed me, except for Greg, so when they killed him I immediately turned it off. Dumb movie!
Absolute garbage
Of course it would start off gay 🤮🤮🤮🤮 tired of this agenda being pushed .. guess I’ll have to go back to old school horror movies. Even though being gay is horrifying 😂 still don’t wanna see it
I hate Alice with a passion. The girl who played her for sure got threats after this movie. Like how dumb and more annoying can a character get.
The acting was beyond cringy but I did like the idea of the plot.
Garbage movie
is pete playing a 21 year old or the creepy older dude who hangs around all the college kids
Boring Boring Boring
the movie really shows the lengths of how people can be so frustratingly stupid and paranoid, over all it's a great movie i really enjoyed it
Starring the luckiest human being on the planet
Tbh this was actually good! Surprised no one mentioned the actress the payed Jordan, she did a great job!
No spoiling, is this movie actually scary if you put your phone down and watch it in the dark?
Dumbt movoe ever  gay black rich woman so believable 🙄 CW Vibes in writing
If you end up watching this movie you will have waisted your time for nothing its a movie about the typical American behavior of today
VERY suspenseful and good!
just finished the movie and "holy fucking cow wtfff" is my reaction
Never felt so happy when Alice died
I enjoyed this movie because it felt like Broken Lizzard's Club Dread 😂
👅👄🐍💘🦓🐴🏅🕸️🗽⛽✌️⛴️🎖️🤙🥙💇🥇🥥
This movie is 🗑️! Do yourself a favor and don’t watch it. I love horror comedies and hope this would be good, it wasn’t. Only plus is Pete Davidson (rocky raccoon) get taken out first
Greg is the best
Just watched the movie. Started out ok when it seems as though they didnt know how it. Typical of low budget slasher movies. 0:09 However...sad to think but a pretty accurate picture of young people today. 😂 Even though it was poking fun at Gen Z...most of you dont get that it is truth in behavior
any other good horror movies at the same level as this one or better please ??
This movie was not a horror lol wait until the end. Such a dumb fucking twist, but with the characters in the movie. You’d have to agree that it’s the only possibility
Rachel Sennott is the QUEEN. Also, I never realized how incredibly unattractive Pete Davidson is!
Good movie 👌
Trash but also funny AF, waiting for a 2nd part or something similar hahaa
I thought A24 made good movies This shit was trash 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Uhm, snowfall?
Alice is literally my God - like, I watch this movie then I went home and built a shrine to her. I literally pray to her like I pray to Taylor Swift ngl, she's so iconic. I LOVE HERRRRRR
They absolutely crushed this trailer. Perfectly encapsulates the vibe of this film.
Put a chick in it. And make her gay.
it was SOOOOOOO bad I swear
trashy af
The last 30 mins of this movie is so fcuking incredible. When they all start turning g on each other and telling all their secrets is some of the funniest shit I've seen.
LAME AF!!
They all died for nothing lol
The most unique slasher film so far. Keeps you on the toes until that ridiculous twist.
i just watched it and WTFFFFFFFFF 🤣🤣🤣
There are simple people, and there are people who get this trailer
I love how its bloody and kinda funny at the same time
It's all about a bunch of stupid b*tches getting themselves killed through the movie.
No Black men, Lesbianism, Hollywood's agenda..... enforced by design.
best movie of our generation wow
The movies opens with a vile display of some Klingon looking woman in an interracial/homosexual nonsense scene.  Seems A24 has a fetish. It just could haven been so much more believable if they didn't insist on casting black people that can't act just because of some casting quota credit score.  Davidson is good, but his acting gets tarnished when he's grouped with them. Two blacks in a group of seven, come on.
Feels like this was inspired by among us
Probably my favorite movie from 2022. I feel like the satire aspect of it may have gone over a lot of peoples heads. I watched it online with a group of 50+ people and lots did not understand the entire movie is making fun of these "woke" people.
Just as old slashers brought together the most diverse stereotypes of teenagers at the time, this film shows our
Pete Davidson at the end made me laugh SO hard
I like this movie. Dennis winship
What a dumb movies. Probably the worst horror I have ever seen. The only horror was the horror of having to watch it. Dumb dumb dumb.
A bunch of women, that cant talk right or grow up, nah im good
Question?  Who turned off the electricity?  And why it turned back on when max came to the house?  Someone please answer if possible
I felt like the Russian girl was the killer.
I feel like a lot of people missed the satire.  It was heavy and on the nose
This movie was soooooooooo very terrible. Sorry not sorry.
Yikes a A24 film I don’t want to see
I regret watching this movie, it's so fucking bad,
i can’t entirely put my finger on it but this movie reminds me of “I know what you did last summer”
Honestly…… I was rooting for them all to die!!!!! These characters were the most annoying!!! I turned it off after they went to find the friends much OLDER boyfriend 😆😒😴
Tbe dude slashed his own throat. Saved yall 1hr n 30min
Your silenceing me wtf hahaahah
Is this a good movie?
I really hope I can save someone from watching this vomitous raging dumpster fire of a movie. Pick the worst movie you have ever heard of and go watch that instead. Go watch glitter. Everything about this movie makes me physically ill.
Does anyone know how to do Sofie's eye makeup?🙄🙄
It's A24 production. So, for sure I won't watch it.
These characters all seem insufferable.
Hollywood Make-up and DateNights BGBG
The ending got me 🤣
Typical entitled American lifestyle and community. No wonder America is full of shooting cases
I’m gonna watch it but eww Pete 😩 i so wish that guy would go back to his coffin and sleep
ahh i am goanna work with A24 one day
zoomer horror sucks.
Woke
Probably the worst movie by A24… Some of the worst acting I have ever seen. 4/10 🍿
Whoever screamed “yeeessss” in the beginning 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Que filme louco, meus amigos. Quando eles revelam o final! P*t* que pariu 😂😂😂 não soube nem reagir
I've never been bored so much by good acting before. It's incredible, maybe had 2 moments where it was funny, the midpoint and the end. It's one of those movies I'm glad I watched, but I surely won't recommend it, maybe the outtakes....but that's it
Probably the worst A24 film i've ever seen, just awfil
This movie was GREAT. I have never seen one of the actors - Rachel Sennott before, but she was AWESOME! Very versatile, also Pete Davidson was PERFECT for his role as well. Can't see it working without him. Beginning 8/10 Middle 9/10 Ending 8.5/10
I watched this 45 minutes late, high asf and it was one of the best experiences I had.
Worst movie I've ever seen 🤣 had all the generic gen z tropes, talking about being triggered and a victim
Looks terrible!!!
This movie was fucking terrible
This was just weird...
This was actually pretty damn good. Laughed my ass off a few times. These ladies were great. Especially the one that gets shot, she was hilarious
RACHEL WAS A STANDOUT IN THE MOVIE!
RACHEL DID A GREAT JOB IN THE MOVIE!
THIS MOVIE WAS CRAZY!
OMG THIS MOVIE WAS WILD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I loved watching this when it came out, I low key wanna watch it again, most Gen Z thing I ever watched 💀
the ending is so fucking funny 😂
No one can see thumbs down amount anymore So here you go. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
If this is the future of movies we're screwed
Absolute garbage movie
This 👏🏻 was 👏🏻 so 👏🏻 good
Who wants to watch "shite shite shite"....this Is the film for you 🤣🤣🤣
OMG, LOOKS PAINFUL TO WATCH THIS CRAP.......MAKES SESNE THO, AFTER  DATING A KARDASHIAN   PETE'S  LIFE AND CAREER IS BASICALLY OVER
OMG, LOOKS PAINFUL TO WATCH THIS CRAP.......MAKES SESNE THO, AFTER  DATING A KARDASHIAN   PETE'S  LIFE AND CAREER IS BASICALLY OVER
This was an embarrassingly bad movie
Bad trailer but the movie was actually good, worth watching
This movie was so self aware and so freaking funny!
I love A24 but I think I will pass on this one
Good movie but dialogue was so cringy, but then again we gen z are cringy
What channel can I watch this?
I want my 1 and a half hour of my life back!! 😩😩
Gen Z is the $h!thole of humanity!
kaloka the ending🤭
garbage. drugs and sex and gay shit. can I just get a slasher without the filler nonsense?
As a milli, this movie was really good!
Movie me Thrill Suspence kuch bhi nahi he, Sabse bada Ghatiya Disgusting movie😡👎👎👎
Maha Bakwas Ghatiya movie👎
One of the shittiest movies of the year.
I will NOT watch this because of Pete davidson. No matter how good the movie is, if a degraded person like pete involves, bye-bye.
best movie ever and song
Gen Z is so stupid that they merely think this is about them and don’t realize it’s actually making fun of them for how ridiculous they act and how offended they are by everything.
1:07
My favorite movie of 2022
"I caught the bomber" practice. Nice
stupid movie...ouije board in a new jacket
The Cabo 6 wow had to come see the trailer after someone brought this up in a video about her hmmmm
The ending scene I was like: HUWHAAAAAT?
Aaff ... tired of Gen Z
I was extremely shocked this was an A24 movie, not one for me it seems
1:25 when Charlie and Alan change their roles
Who was the damn killer
You know Pete Davidson went up to the director and asked if he could ad that line about f*cking. "Hey I got some script rewrites I wanted to show you. Can I say this please please pleaeeeeeese??!!"
Great movie, just watch it
U Cant go wrong if it's from A24 🔥😌
Moronic.  Racoon looking Davidson.  That guy is a serious suspect.
horseshit
This comment section has a very different genZ experience than I'm having you guys need to find new friends man😭
I've noticed some of these shows and movies seem to be more about normalizing feminist gender cult terms or attempting to theme the movie or show around them. Pffft Now you understand why a lot of these suck.
terrible movie
This movie really unravels the disgusting and insane face of the woke...
this igosd good omlviek i watch iwth my friends
Lame shit
I just love A24 😭✌🏻 they always give us a good movies 😭 THANK YOU
My friends reco this and said theres a twist in the end. Well i didnt guess it right
Nope.
Corniest lamest gayest movie
I just watched this. The plot is very similar to the Filipino film called "Bloody Crayons".
what a stupid movie..........
Omg........!!!!!.......Where can I watch thisssss!?
This movie looks like the epitome of the most annoying people on tik tok. Not interested
i have reception
Thats TGAF - Truly Gay AF
the ending was fucking hilarious :D
we just finished watching it and we are searching who the killer is until many are dead and the plot twist at the end tho
I had my doubts about watching this, and i dont know why i doubt A24 at this point, specially in horror. The movie is gripping since the first minute and it keeps your interest and guessing from start to end, is funny, well shot, great pacing and great acting, i enjoyef it a lot.
I mean if this is truly satire..... it's brilliant.
Thanks, now I know it's a piece of crap I thought it was after 15 minutes of watching:)
As much as I absolutely despise Gen-Z and Pete Davidson, I have to admit I kinda enjoyed this silly, wholly original film.
Dude said he looks like he fucks when in reality he just looks fucked 😂
"i'm smart im strong i'm ready for what comes along" WHAT IS MUSIC ????
Makes you believe in eugenics
Why is this like the comedy skits of NigaHiga
This looks like it was made by Twitter girls that post fan cams
Opening scene was such a ridiculous turnoff I shut it off after ten seconds.
One of the worst movies like!! The characters r soooo dvmb in a bar way+ the plot amd dialogs r so bad everythinh is bad and i really love the kind of movies
is this "among us"?
Trash ass movie
Yo at the end of this movie i was like what the actual f cause ain’t no way😭😭
This film was hilarious
Like bloody crayons movie
just finished watching this movie and man I'm still laughing at how stupid each one of them was
The fucking ending is fucking joke. Nice satire gen z movie btw .
Excellent film. Fantastic idea. Great characterisation. And very funny. Bravo! 👏
It's crazy how 2 girls kissing become so boring.  Sexuality is like the new Devil somehow...Empty.
DUMB! Modern youth are brainless
are they suppose to be college kids? like the girls look like 19 early 20s. but the guys look mid 30s.
A24 never disappoints
Good movie, right from the beginning I hated most ot the characters (vapid social influencer type) and looked forward to them being offed.
wow that was really good...kept trying to look for the killer but damn lol
What an absolute trash of a movie, 1/10.
I fell asleep while watching this so the trailer still brings suprises to me
Whatever I thought was wrong
so who's the killer🙄
woke fem trash
Spoiler alert: It's going to have a funny/awkward ending. Don't do drug kids.
If your into partying, profanity, sex, drugs and alcohol this is for you. Sad
Feminism
gosh, sick of seeing pete davidson. don't they have any other white guy they can put on the screen other than him?
The ending was epic 🤣
the ending is just wow, did not expect that :))
watching this cause amandla and maria are so hot and theyre together here... wheww
Modern movies are a laughable joke.
1:06
"Am so trigger right, now you are silencing me " 😂
Great movie with an unbelievable ending you'll never coming
Whatever you have to say about this movie, the trailer itself is pretty damn good. It doesn't show any proper spoilers (except a glimpse if you pause the video) and just gets the general idea across of that people are dying and we'll have to figure out who is the killer.
i NEED it in spain pleaseee
i hate that 'did you fucking shoot me' 'i cant believe you're making this about you' are two seperate dramatic scenes edited to seem like a funny scene they put in the flick (sadly it's not in there, a solid movie though)
The most gen z movie ever made. But very very funny!!!!!!
Realistic teen talk of these days? Gonna watch this.
they hired the ugliest actors for this movie..🤮🤮🤮
Did Charli xcx literally make this song for this film
Trailer isn't very funny . . .
If I see this trailer one more time I’m deleting YouTube
-10/10
Garbage of the year
What a garbage movie. Since the beginning until the end is awful
Wtf i just watched 💀
One of the most fun movies of 2022! Love a24 no matter what
This is crazy weird.
please let this be peak millennial
I didn't even know this movie existed until the controversy
this movie was so bad-
Were can I download it
So, it's funny & not scary?
This is A24’s Among Us
Trash
This looks camp as hell! Cant wait to watch it
Pete Davidson being in it is a great red flag not to see it
It looks so crappy movie and full of uncanny confusion, I didn't like the trailer so I won't watch it. This movie for weirdos and out of common sense
The fact this is an obvious piss take out of all the dumb shit "Gen Z" or just simply young twats say or do, makes this an instant watch 😂
Rachel Sennot, the actress who plays Alice, is a huge standout in this film! Absolutely loved her.
SKETE
A horror film where all the main characters are insufferable is a bold move! Looking forward to watching it!
Looks perfect for all the dumbass drones out there!
This trailer made it look like Sorority Row 2022 but it really isn't a slasher movie at all.  More like a modern Gen Z Agatha Christie movie
This is far too accurate to be parody.  All the more reason why I refuse to see it.  Hard pass.
Have they announced Rachel Sennott’s Oscar win yet? tired of waiting tbh.
Looks like one of those movies where you root for the killer.
I love looking at newest comments and seeing how vapid and close minded some people are. This was a fun slasher film that kept you guessing and laughing. Plus if you're that much of a bitter bitch, you can laugh at the teens making mistakes because that's pretty much the entire movie
One of the worst movies of the year with a cast of the most obnoxious characters since . . well ... X . . . which was also A24.  A pretty young woman sitting next to me with her boyfriend remarked at the in-your-face lesbian-kissing opening scene: "That's extreme."  Well, I guess there is still hope among millenarians Gen Z'ers.
nonsense
This movie was great 10/10 would see again
I was interested in this - and then I saw Pete Davidson
I am so tired of the same trashy characters over and over again.
At the end of the movie, anyone know what music that was??
Wait, I've seen this movie already... isn't this just Sorority Row?
I saw this in a movie theatre earlier when i went to watch a movie and it looked so god damn obnoxious that i wanted to see if people hated it as much as i did from the trailer, im surprised to see thats not the case, still not watching it though
Aaron Rodgers had quite the off-season
No takes
this movie is dope
Another Pete Davidson Flop
I hope this is going to be funny. Cause I'm kind of expecting it to be like older people writing what they think teens say
Of course there are lgbt characters 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
just saw tonight, gave it a 9/10. best way to describe it imo is, a cocaine covered, gen z “knives out”.
Run, run, run to spend your money on this bag of trash, kiddies! 🤣
this is literally among us
1:26 when a woman asks me how I would describe my personality
"Did you just fucking shoot me", "I can't believe you're making this about you" - This movie is hella funny, wtf. I would've been scared and screaming BECAUSE I WAS SHOT!
so fuckin bad people....
I love Rachel Sennott so much with a burning passion
This looks so trash it’s hurting my eyes
where can i watch it pls ?
Looks like a pile of Garbage. I’ll be rooting for the Gen Zers deaths
This looks so dumb
"Among Us" live-action?
so the horror factor is the dialogue right ? also this is a teen movie i was told , isn't that kim k's boyfriend, the man is like 30 yo lol , he REALLY wanted to be in a movie , didn't he
this is gonna be huge on tiktok
I'm here for Lee Pace
the way she said "yea" at the end all blank in the eyes... WHERE CAN I WATCH THISSSS
This might be the rare August movie that doesn't suck.
If Twitter was real life in a movie?
rachel Sennott is deadass so funny
Who want to play body ody ody ody ody ody
looks better then Pearl
SEES RACHEL
This looks hilarious and very intriguing, love the back and forth especially...
ehh no
i thought it's bo dies bo dies bo dies
I like the horror comedy movie plot. I will watch this movie. Date Stamp: 18july22
Bruh
This looks like a blast, tbh
This movie is a horror and comedy movie
This trailer traffic's in ageist stereotypes and mocks civil rights activism.
Among us.
Among Us
IRL AMONG US!!!! Lmao
Among us. The movie
A24 could make a movie about “how to brush your teeth”. I’d still see it.
This was definitely written by a 50 year old who has no concept of gen z😭
Pete Davis is funny.  The rest just look annoying.
This looks like pure shit
looks like absolute garbage
this will be 🔥🗑
Pete Davidson is obviously I’s the killer I bet my house on that 😂😂
Is the movie named after the snow fall meme 😂😂😂
Basically among us
I can’t believe nobody noticed Lee Pace taking part in this movie !
It's literally among us
I love A24 movies but that raccoon looking guy is there and I'm not a fan so it's an easy skip
Crap
Amongus
It’s a Zlasher. A slasher for zoomers.
So basically an Among Us movie?
This looks so stupid and campy I am excited
I'm sorry but that looks like pure garbage
You had me at Lee Pace.
I was lucky enough to catch a screening almost a year ago and I gotta say I was super hyped about it. Kinda gave me the same feeling as when I watched Scream when it hit theatres.
Saw this trailer in theaters for the black phone (A+ movie btw!) & immediately knew i HAD to see it 😂
Can’t wait for this movie….to be on the Kill Count 💯💯🤣🤣
Guys, I'm obsessed with the trailer, what should I do?
amogus
When is the Charli XCX song coming out?
Tight
CHARLI
I was kind of enjoying this trailer until Pete Davidson showed up
Lee Pace, damn.
This movie looks really well made and great tbh, I don’t know why people are mad about the acting and saying it looks corny like no shit it’s supposed to be cringey they are playing college students not fucking teenagers! I heard good reviews from the sxsw premiere and everyone loved it and said it was “bat shit crazy and will keep you wondering who did it!” Definitely watching this no matter what dumbasses say it looks stupid all movies are crap so expect crap for the next few years lmaoo!
Hopefully I'm not the only person who finds all these characters repellent?
PASS
Garbage, Garbage, Garbage.
I was born in 1997 and straight up hate this new generation.  The way you speak, act… just everything.
This looks so fucking stupid. Horrible writing
among us?
this is one of those movies about teenagers written by full on adults
Gay.
Nah.
Predicted IMDb score : 5.4/10
This shit looks like absolute garbage. If every character doesn’t die 1/2 minute into the movie, it will fucking suck.
god i love a24
Pete Davidson?  Ugh, nevermind, i just lost all interest
I can't wait. I love Pete. I know cheesy and stupid but it's my type vibe
This looks good
"You're always gaslighting me" is honestly iconic af.
Who Green Lit This?
this is the most “this is what millennials think of genz” trailer I’ve ever seen
This looks good
“YOURE SILENCING ME!”
Legs and Hips and Bodies Bodies Bodies
amogus
Living for this trailer rn and I also love the editing in it.  Cannot wait to watch it.
I’m 32 and already out of touch. I
i heard about this movie having no idea what it was about and just laughed at the title (because it has the same vibes as the title Men lmao). but after watching the trailer i desperately want to see the movie, it seems really good and actually based just on this reminds me of scream but with a lighter tone
There is a script for this movie on Reddit. Very readily available. It's interesting but apparently the final product is very different and it added writers and such. But if you want an idea of what your getting into you can find it there.
Miramax was cool, a24 is just a scam
Well Damn ain't this the end of comedy as we know it .....so sad.
This Movie Is Gonna Fucking Suck🤦
SKEETE?
Seems like an update of April Fool's Day
I worked on this as a PA. You guys are in for a real treat.
IM SO EXCITEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This is always the issue with A24 for me anyways. One moment you get a Masterpiece like "Everything Everywhere All At Once", followed by something lame af like this. Happens all the time
Mid
Lame. Scream is bad enough. Now this scream bargain bin piece of crap.smh.welcome A24 first flop Nice try kids.🤣
i think i better skip this one
I love how this is also like a comedy
This is either the worst movie ever  Or the worst trailer ever
It's like they decided to put in a jar everything that's wrong and cringe and awful in just one place, that "Euphoria" generation, the soundtrack, only thing that surprises me is that I don't see any 'jocks', I don't feel related to this as a human being :D BUT hope it becomes a blockbuster, if it does it means TONS of great films produced by A24 which pretty much is the reason why they did this piece of turd flick in the first place :D
🙄
Soon wheeeeen?? I need that movie right nooow! I’m a gen z I got anxiety A24 you can’t do that to meeee
oh i needa watch THIS
Ong
Pete Davidson makes me not want to watch this
i'm so down for this. I love slasher whodunnits.
why is no one talking about the unreleased charli song in this trailer....????
NOT PETE
They still make bad movies i  see. i haven't watched a movie probably since django unchained or something like that. seems back in the hole for me.   btw peter davidson is trash. Kanye's those kids father.
More leftist drivel. Cant wait to watch this fail miserably too. Go woke go broke.
Pete at the end made me die 😂😂😂
Very weird title but I guess it will match the satire of today’s tech savvy violence obsessed generation  I only know Pete Davidson and Amandla Stenberg in this  Hoping it’s good
Lol this looks great
To wannabe Gen-Z satirists, this is how you do it. Playful instead of cruel, varied instead of repetitive, and knowledgable instead of cherry-picked.
“Did you just fucking shoot me?” “I can’t believe you’re making this about you” My theater was laughing at this part before they played Men😂😂😂
Among Us: The Movie 😂
honestly i love Pete but this movie sounds low buget ...i would be in shock if i like it..we will see..
Why did they cast these old white men with the girls???? Gross
Where the hell do you watch a24 movies??
you neVER LOVED ME MUUUUUUUUUUMMM
How do I watch this an feel scared if anything I hope none of them make it an the house implodes. This belongs as a Netflix movie or Hulu right up there with Euphoria.
Black Christmas 2019 done...right????? oh my god
I watch this trailer everyday 😀
The Killer was payed by Kanye West to kill Pete
WE LOVE A24
They just movies about anything
I am so in!
I'm more of a fan of A24's Indies, but I'll definitely give this a shot. I know they've produced some good horrors as well
'you f***king trigger me' my  fav line
For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.   (Isaiah 66:15-16)
so its like a SNL documentary 😂
slayyyyytheyateeeetho
Omg
As a first impression, this dialouge sounds like a bastardized version of millennial Twitter that some senior citizen wrote up. These out of touch, desperate films are going to age terribly, I hope this flops.
this is deffo a gen z movie
Pretty sure the trailer gives away who the killer is at 1:00 mark.
It’s like they took every Gn Z stereotype and put it in a 80’s horror movie. They need to make this a cinematic universe
Among us w human avatars
This looks so great!
Why does this remind me of “The Babysitter” lmao
filme lacronildo
“YOU’RE SILENCING ME!” omg me and my 7 sisters trying to get through playing any game
Does Maria Bakalova even speak in the movie?? An Oscar nominee without a single line! Shame on them! There are other actors in Hollywood whose first language isn't English and they get bigger roles than her and she's brilliant!
This movie is among us🥶
This looks do good. I’m down !
I am here for this!!!! Love it!!! Pete is already perfect in this and I know it from the trailer! A24 makes no bad films. It's impossible. Some might outshine others but NONE have fallen into anything under a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Looks interesting
A24 at it again. I watched X and it was weirdly good. This one looks interesting. Looking forward to this.
guys i cant find X anywhere do ya guys know where i can get it?
ive never heard a gen z person say this kind of shit not ironically, this feels very "basic" and kind of misogynistic  "with love", a gen z teenage girl 💕
“The bodies, the bodies, the bodies!” -Franklin Saint
You're gaslighting me you trigger me you're so toxic stop silencing me 😂
Isn't this, just based on, "Among Us" ?
"You're so toxic" o yeah deft gen z. I cant hardly wait to watch it.
Among us (2022)
Yep another unique movie for this gen!!!
Gaslighting me!!!
People who actually watch horror movies every day know A24 ain't shit. They get way to much credit for what they release. Ifc midnight and RLJE are better production and distribution companies and have been around for longer.
“bodies bodies bodies” -snowfall
I'm just sitting here cackling at the trailer. Should be a good movie!
They all look like random 20-somethings and then there’s that one dad with the beard and Pete Davidson
Looks dumb
im most def seeing this movie
This looks crazy Pete Davidson’s pretty great in every movie he’s in lately
Let's gooooo A24 don't miss.
Tik tok is gonna love this
Aids24
This movie just screams Gen Z and I am living.
Cringe
first a24 L this movie looks like shit.
Pete Davidson is just playing a character of himself... I ain't complaining this is gonna be good.
Its the girl who asked to play the game.
"Never judge an A24 movie before you see it." - Francis Ford Coppola
This is a movie that looks hilariously suspenseful. I want to see it, ESPECIALLY because Amandla Stenberg is in it.
Who’s the girl w the blonde braids
This is if Gen-Z met with late 80s, early 90s slasher/whodunnit horror movies. Say Euphoria and Scream had a collab.
i cannot wait till august 5th i need it now
Spring breakers parody + Scream 😭😭
was that Lee Pace
LEE PACE OMG SOLD SEEING IT
in A24 we trust!!!
You're triggering me, you're so toxic, you're silencing me. Yeah this is definitely a Gen Z movie.
Does every single movie coming out of America HAVE to have girls kissing girls or guys kissing guys?
Good shot a24 anything will be 10000000x better than the dumbass movie x
Who else thought of that one Snowfall scene with Damson Idris after seeing the movie's title?
slasher movie but make it 2022? i'm down.
$20 says Pete Davidson finds some way to include a joke about his late dad into the movie
I didn’t think I’d wanna watch it but now I feel like I need to see this  😅
Literally shows you who the killer is at 1:00
This movie is obvious bait for tik tok kids and they take it without a second thought
Not gonna lie but this actually looks pretty dumb.
Tf
i love how this just looks like a bunch of gen z lesbians and then old ass pete davidson is just there
💧💧💧
*this movies gonna eat*
Spoiler Alert   The killer is their personality.
Barf
Pete should act as Chad in this film
Well… I’m watching this.
Popcorn will be so delicious with this.
Feels like April Fools Day...I'm in
Love this already 😂😂
What is the song?
So basically Tinder Swipe Night the movie.
Franklin St' James IYKYK
I’m here for Pete ❤️
Spring Breakers meets Scream (but like nowadays Scream not the older 90s Scream)
Did Pete Davidson HAVE to be in this? The cast looks great as it is
i’m so excited for this. it’s gen Z without that irritating lens that older people typically use to portray us
MARIA BAKALOVA????????
These mfs pump out movies like no other 💀
So..... Gen Z the movie?
since it’s A24 i’m hoping this movie isn’t just making fun of modern teen girls and actually goes deep into how we present ourselves today and why
“You’re silencing me!” Why I laugh every time 😭
That “yea” at the end was so Kardashian of her lol
Bet ya they’ll pass the "message" x100 on dis shit
For once, a Gen Z like movie that has all slang and terms in a teen slasher movie with comedy. I’m looking forward to this movie 😂
This looks really cringe honestly.
i’m absolutely obsessed
“realx relax” “YOUR SILENCING ME!!!” 😂😂😂
Oh hell no. I can NOT let A24 mess up my mind again.
ooothis looks cringe-
chase and rachels line delivery ateee
This is such a shitty movie already a bunch of tiktokers trying to be actors only thing that's good is the camera quality even then the guy has a shaky hand
The fall of A24
Zoomer the movie. Hard pass
The horror here is watching pretty 20 year olds argue for 90 mins   …. I miss the 80s when Jason just got to work. We don’t care  your boyfriend hasn’t returned your Snapchat Jane!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Didn’t know genera+ion had a horror special!!! Can’t wait😌
Here for Amandla my bday twin yeeeee 👌
This is just among us
wow didn’t realize how much i needed this
20 years from now people are going to look back on how dumb as shit this generation was and i wont be watching this movie
“What is that” “Xanax you want one?” BYE☠️☠️
A24 never disappoints
Pete looks like these kids uncle lmao
Ok first things first i love petes laid back vibes
This movie looks like absolute garbage but since I regard Pete Davidson as comedy gold and the best of the best I will be watching it.
Looks horrible. Hopfully they just made a shitty trailer.
Generation defying satire is SPOT ONNN I need to watch this
Generationnation vibes! I like it. Good to see the actress who played Riley on Generation+ getting more work too!
I’m working on a comic that’s a chaotic & drug fueled horror story… I love this, I love these movies! spring breakers, bling ring, but make it horror. Can’t wait <3
A teen slasher is all you had to say and I'm in.
If Tik Tok was a movie
Trash
amon gus
Ooooh Lee Pace 😍
this looks funny but kinda wish Pete wasn’t in it he stands out too much
Scream for Gen Z
Skete Davidson eeww
This one ☝️ this one right here ☝️☝️☝️ s
Idk about this movie
Movie had potential until they decided to leave Pete Davidson in there for an extended time. Suicide Squad hit the perfect formula for how long he should be involved in anything
This is going to be really great. Or really horrible. It can go either way.
Dumbest movie of the year :)
This is hysterical
Oh wow butthole eyes is in it. Can't wait to never watch it.
Was invested till I saw the sloth from ice age 🙄
Looks great but I would only watch it bc it’s A24
This reminds me of that AHS influencer episode 😅 I'm sure A24 will do it better though
Ah yeah, just what we need: another deeply misogynistic critique of teen girls disguised as being labeled "satire."
Eid Mobarak
This kind of zeitgeistey dialogue could cement this movie into the early 20s like Clueless did for the 90s. In a good way.
This would probably be pretty good if a major part of the plot wasn't making fun of women
"Bodies Bodies Bodies"  "Kuchie kuchie kuchie!"
I’ve never heard so many “ Woke “ Statements in a row 😂😂😂 Damn this generation 🧬 is sleep 😴
Yesssss Rachel, Amandla, and Pete
A24 never dissapoints.
this looks bad, somehow even worse than most A24 films
meow
Lmaoooo gen z in a Movie 😭😭😭
I'm absolutely fed up with the persistent bullying of young people, specifically girls, in the name of "satire." I really expected better from A24 with Men coming out later this month. I guess with every step forward we have to take a gigantic sexist step backward. Do better.
People taking the opportunity to act elitist over a satire film.....lmao
This look funny and SOO good. Can’t wait
it’s A24 so I trust this movie to be somewhat good
Ok but why is Lee Pace in this? That’s like… my main question here 😅
a24 does it again
A24 is going downhill smh.. this is 🚮
Pete Davidson might be the least funny person of all time
Woke trash
LMFAOOOOOO THEY ROASTING US
There are so many horror films that I watch and think, "This is so 80's" or "This is so 2000's". I am really excited to see a trailer for a film that just screams this era. Can't wait to see it. You can always depend on A24 to give us something truly unique!
this movie is like "ioneven friggin caarrr dew"
This looks wack af. Come on A24!
I'm supposed to be from gen z, but with this trailer... I don't feel I'm even a person yet :/
this reminds me of that James Franco movie with Vanessa Hudgens... I hope this is better
OF COURSE it has Charli on the soundtrack.
Trailer didnt get me excited, but since Lee Pace is in this, it must be decent.
use me as a We love rachel sennott button
😂 this is gonna be hilarious
Is franklin saint in this?
Cool
oh noooo
The girl who's being gaslighted is literally me, she's already my fave
Does anybody know the music on the background?
OMG
Pete must have a big piece, he's not funny or a good actor.
Reminds me of a Filipino film called Bloody Crayons (though that one takes itself more seriously)
Dose anyone know what song there singing in the Beginning
Spring Breakers meets Climax...
A24 really whats going on 😔
This looks like aggressively Gen Z version of Scream and it’s either going to be amazing or dogshit with no in between.  Since it’s A24 I’m betting on the former
There has not been one A24 films I haven't dislike my favs
I can’t tell if this is the cringiest thing I’ve ever seen or if it looks genuinely entertaining.
We get it a24, your movies are for young people.
Oh no, not Skete.
Pete never looks like he’s acting💀 he’s just being himself
This film was made specifically for me. This has such big assassination nation vibes. This will become a cult film for me
They gave the killer away so obviously In the trailer y’all it makes me sad 😭😭
I SAID I NEED IT!
What is this lol
I feel like I’m the only person on the planet who never wants to see Pete Davidson ever again.
Wth did i just watch lmao
Why does this feel like yet another project that at first was an attempt at relating to the current generations, but quickly turned into a thinly veiled mockery of it's target audience?
CAST!!! Omg
What?
bad
Not sure how I feel about this
I’m smart I’m strong.  I’m ready for whatever comes along. I got good friends. We’ll stick together until the end.  I’m able to do whatever I put my mind to. I like myself. I’m worth a lot. like myself. I’m worth a lot. Don’t say I’m not cause you can’t see inside of me..  Wow talk about blast from the past..
Is it just me, or is A24 the Devolver Digital of the cinema world?
This is "Springbreakers" fro Gen Z.
Well it's the most gen Z video I have watched. Let's pretend we all fearless and do stupid shit just because we are woke!
Mehhh
this has already had a good few screenings. Critics loved it but audiences, not so much
A24 movies are always so refreshing…
A24, where fever dreams become real.
i need this -_-
Why am I getting a harmony korine's spring breakers vibe?
It's A24's world... we're just living in it!
is that the “its la if you dont have an eating disorder get one bitch” girl????
Cult Classic already, just replaced Mean Girls
Love A24
“ You fucking trigger me” 🤣😭💀 the most Gen z phrase ever 🤣
Republicans are becoming more and more fascist we don’t need a film mocking leftists
All we need is Leatherface to walk in the room with a blood drenched chainsaw and then have them all whip out their phones and say, "Try anything and you're cancelled bro."
🗑 Skete go find God
I hope this movie flops I hate gen z and I hate the way they talk so A24 making this movie really makes me want all the girl's characters in this film dead
Reminds me of Battle Royale and Hunger Games
Jesus this looks hilarious.
I'm hoping in the end that the killer wins. All dead😋
damn
Bring back bullying cause how tf do this many people not know what satire is? A modest proposal by Jonathan Swift? Animal farm? Fahrenheit 451? Do they not teach this anymore?
In my opinion this movie doesn't look promising at all. It lookz like another horror flick trying to pay homage to the new stupid wayz of today.
I see Pete Davidson, I dislike the video
Is it making fun of Gen Z?
So, Spring Breakers but Scream.
No just no
this is everything scream queens wish it was
Yes Pete Davidson 😩
rachel sennott>>
a24 never misses. down for it honestly
Nice
Pete Davidson?
I really hope A24 gets recognized for giving us something more than franchises and existing IP’s. This run is legendary right now.
Petition for A24 to start their own streaming platform
luvs it
I love A24 but this looks absolutely awful.
no but why does this actually look good
говнина для детей
Obnoxious obnoxious obnoxious.
I'm probably gonna watch it, because I have faith in A24 but damn I'm so sick and tired of Privileged American teens' slasher movies , even if it's a satire on them. And it doesn't help that it's so obvious in the things it satirizes. Also, Pete Davidson has such a punchable face it's gonna be super distracting.
This is gonna be a another weird movie from A24.
It looks so cringe and bad tbh
All that genZ talk made me wish that unlike button was back and working
This looks amazingly hilarious 😂
Pass.  It's an A24 film, which is great. But, it's also stars Pete Davidson, which is... yuck.
Feels like a blumhouse movie
Lol this is like a Gen Z clue I love it
Filme de terror com adolescente fazendo merda? Adoro!
Amandla kinda looks like a young Nicki Minaj
Take my money!
I was like ehhh, not really my thing, but then I saw that Lee Pace was in it and now I want to see it.
Damn usually love A24 but this one looks weak
wow, a horror thing with gen z kids...
Your movies are going to drain all my money...cannot complain
Bro, A24, i want to kiss all of you. Making banger after banger after banger.
Looks so good, hope it doesn't drag releasing to the UK
amogus in real life
i am gonna love this
stupid. stick with movies like X lol
Another movie where Pete Davidson plays himself.
If Pete Davidson is the killer I'll snap.
I hate Pete Davidson
Scream for a new generation.
I see they hired Chad.
Comments drooling over a24 remember they are just the film distributor, praise the directors instead
Cringey
I feel like this is trying to mix a Teen Slasher with Woke bullshit. lol
Waiting for A24 to make another movie like Hereditary
Pete Davidson might just have explained the mystery around his attraction
Can’t believe Rue joined a sorority after dying on The Hunger Games!
This looks like a cheap a24 film im sorry
Listen here...I see A24  I'm IN!!!
Yeah, this looks buzz worthy 😆
1:27 Pete finally reveals how he gets all the women!
OMG I'M ALREADY LOVING THE VIBE HERE HOPE IT WON'T DISAPPOINT ✨
Wait. Lee Pace and Pete Davidson in one movie?! OMG this movie is so hot!
Amongus the movie
This looks so fun! 😂
it is a grate movie.
I hope Pete gets gruesomely murdered in this movie
this looks so good!
I still don’t understand the appeal of Pete Davidson Both in a funny of a sexy way, at all
Meh… I prefer Spring Breakers
Another film like X so it looks like A24 is doing a little repeating in its recent films
Is this the X sequel To West was talking about
Black christmas 2
This is so Gen Z, I WANNA WATCH IT!!
Yall shouldve used the song Bodies by Jazmine Sullivan but make it cinematic and intense pls
Ok kanye better l skete
LoL Pete he cant act
Maria Bakalova is a good acctres but after The Bubble ( which was horrible in every way, and I dare say she was the worst actor in it ) and now watching this trailer I'm starting to worry about her career. Judd Apatow was constantly hiding her face while she was talking  ( a lot of Over The Shoulder shots if you look closely) and stupidly small amount of lines and now this trailer where she was the only one without a single line is just a bad sign and decline. I hope she gets her shit together because she got 3 new roles because of Borat but that's it. If she doesn't kill it in her next movies... well guess what.
This actually looks good ngl
I already know Rachel Sennott is  going to be the funniest.
Oh yea pete is dy!ng first isn’t he
Halina Love from your native country The Netherlands! Het ziet er belovend uit!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
This looks shit
They better use the song "bodies" by Drowning pool!
Oh gosh now teenagers are going to want to start killing each other for entertainment. That’s our future 🤦🏻‍♀️
This looks like an absolutely terrible movie. The acting of Ghostbusters reboot with the writing of the janitor who was outside the door listening to the Scary Movie 4 writers one time.
Pete Davidson looking like a meth head
Looks dumb. And Pete Davidson is boring af
A24 doesn't miss
Maria did it.
It’s Pete.
This looks hilarious… but it’s also A24, soooo…
I'm definitely gonna watch this... btw who's disliking this?
They trying hard to make that corny a$$ Davidson a big star and he's not Adam Sandler I just all the rich woman he sleep with worked he a corny piggyback rider at this point anybody can be a star
these comments gotta be bots lol this looks terrible lol
They could have found some better bodies,  And they sure couldn't call it, "Faces Faces Faces."  That's just too big a stretch.
Awesome........
Completely useless trailer....
Yesss, love films with teen girl protagonists! Especially horror.
Perfect timing, maybe we should tweet about it, and make it about "them"🤣
Lol the makeup placement of the fake blood on her face in thumbnail she know what she doing! They want to be indians so bad
song name please
It’s weird to me that people could watch this trailer and feel hyped to see the movie. I watched it, and I feel genuinely sad about the trajectory of humanity.
Amon. ..
Not sure about this one....😬😬😬😬
lame
This feels like a movie my friend Jasper in Theater class would write
rachel sennott and chase sui wonders? this movie will be my joker
rachel sennott. thats it. im sold
Spring breakers wannabe vibes
Lol passs
CHASE SUI WONDERS AND LEE PACE?😍😍 I'll be waiting for this one!
Gen Z Slasher! Love it!
I'll pass
Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump
maybe the kids will enjoy it, I'm too old now
CHARLI ❤️❤️❤️
Man I’m sad if I’m honest I was expecting more like serious slasher. I’m not a fan of comedy horror movies but idk something still makes me want to watch this. Plus A24 is a beloved studio of mine so I feel it may not be what I expect
Looks really bad
Grab your popcorn 🍿
pete davidson?….ew
its a yes for me.
@0:59 xd
Glow stick girl Carrie’s this film on her back I already know it
Trigger, toxic, gaslighting, silencing me, lesbians kissing.  Is there any other cliché that's been left out of this movie.
“Generation defying satire”  This won’t be my cup of tea
If there is one reliable seal of quality in the film industry nowadays is that A24 👌 thanks for always raising the bar.. can’t wait fir this one
So…. Among us
lol really? this looks like one of the most idiotic movies this year - maybe ever good lord..
Ur always gaslighting me LOL
I just kinda hate Pete Davidsaom now, never really brings anything new to the table...a one-trick-pony
Looks trash
i cannot wait for this movie!!!
Calling it now:   Maria’s character will either be the killer or the final girl. She has almost no lines in the trailer and she isn’t pictured when the girls are shown together multiple times. In each shot, she is looking away, afraid, not saying anything, tentative, etc.   Amandla’s character will get killed in the climax, just like Leah Pipe’s character (Jessica) in Sorority Row despite being one of the more charismatic characters.
Among us game ☺️in a24 vibes
Lol this looks funny as h.
Pete is insufferable.
the bit towards the end is funny
pete davidson gon be the killer
*Всем читающим этот комент, крепкого здоровья, исполнения желаний и всех благ! ❤*
Who watches these kind of movies ? This is a perfect example of what Boomers think is cool in this day and age..... WOKE GARBAGE MOVIE
This look like an adaptation of Twitter and not in a good way.
I saw Skete and my day is ruined.
This looks like something shit out by blumhouse.
Whoever came up with the game is always the killer
Ugly non white bodies that is.
👤💬it’s the Covert he’s after
👤💬STEELO be still!!!! she’s fine👀🤙
trash
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
The movie seems dumb,I wouldn’t be surprised if Pete Davidson was the killer
that looks so bad lol
Is this a irl among us?
Rooting for the killer already.
Wait, where’s the Drowning Pool song?
Charli XCX In the soundtrack I'm booked
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🎈
Olpoy
If Pete Davidson is in it, I’m watching it.
Kardashian Kardashian Kardashian
Can Pete get off the drugs long enough to fix his eyes, wtf is those bags???
This looks like pure chaos really.......I can't tell if it's going to be good or not. Plus I don't know any of those people other than Pete.
Entitled, spoiled, over privileged teenagers acting all edgy. Amazing.  Masterpiece I'm sure.
I'll watch it
I like to "Put out that SAME Vibe" that Pete talks about........But when your over 45 and not very Rich?........."Doesn't work as well"🤣
Love me some A24...but these whiny Gen Zers with their "Woke" platitudes makes me wish they were all dead before the opening credits.
These movies are all exactly the same. Boring.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
boring. im gonna say kim k took an L on this one
Lmao at the bot spam copypasting the same comments
Can’t relate to the posh drug addicted pretty teens and it’s cliche as humanly possible. It’s woke clue…. Y’all used to make such good movies too
Spoiler: Their friend is de*d.
This looks so awesome, I've been looking forward to this since it was announced, but this trailer makes me even more excited!! Also very proud of director Halina Reijn, directing an A24 as a Dutchy (her first English language film and only her second film as a director) and doing a hell of a job if I believe the reviews, is very impressive :)
Can someone please explain Pete Davidson to me .
This reminds me of a Filipino Slasher film called "Bloody Crayons" where someone kill one of their friend using a poison while playing an innocent game of truth or dare of sorts involving crayons, and then the others start killing each other because they can't figure out who's the real killer amongst them, so basically they are all killers except for the main character.
"I'm Pete Davidson!"
X was great, I love A24, I hate teen stupid movies with futile characters - which I hope this isn't, let's watch it ❤️
A24 just keeps putting out amazing works
Huh??
I got it... it's a Gasper Noe film... but all are Ariana Grande fans... ;D
This looks hilarious
Let me guess its all the male characters
Just give me a scene where someone gets brutally murdered to a charli xcx song
Scream + Spring Breakers = Bodies Bodies Bodies
Looks dope but that Pete Davidson part about how he fucks is sooooooo laaaaaaaameeeee 😑
I can’t wait !
too much cringe, i cant breathe 😩
Keeping up with the Kardashians (reality television) horror spoof. I’m sure it’ll be a 3/5
the dislikes prove the trailers point
1:09...
Seems interesting, I'll have to look into it
i’m a simple girl. i see pete. i click.
Not impressed! We need coda part 2
America is becoming a huge cult... scary
everything i need right now
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Looks fucking awful
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh…hhh 🤷🏽‍♂️
Imagine if no one actually dies in this movie, yet they're all still being overdramatic. I feel like that would fit with this movie's tone.
1:06 - 1:14 sold me on this movie completely
Pete in the world of A24 is going to be quite an interesting collaboration.
This looks freaking cool
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
I think Maria Bakalova’s character is the killer here 🔪
Ugh I can't wait. Yet ANOTHER A24 film looks great. Can't complain with the track record!!
Nobody in the world loves gay people more than Jesus Christ. He is willing to accept you just the way you are. All you have to do is believe Jesus died on the cross for all your sins (past present and future) and you will go to heaven; no matter what sin u do it is still forgiven
This looks so fucking awesome, I really didn't know what to expect, still dont and that's how you gain intrigue
gen z + horror.... You know it's going to be good
Oh look another generic a24 crap
Ready for this one. X was great 👵🏻👵🏻🔪
This reminds me of Cry Wolf
I’ll give A24 a gold star for this new movie!!!
Did Pete Davidson have to be in this
Omfg i read a article and it spoiled the killer the trailer too look at 0:59
nope,  sucks!
I LOVE THIS SONG FROM CHARLI
My vibe is Pete Davison vibe let’s gooooo
This looks like hot ass, BUT, it also looks like it'll be a good movie to go watch for a meme.
Pete Davidson...and skip!
a24 is carrying
You puch your limit A24
This looks hilarious and like a lot of fun
Jesus, King of Kings, is coming back to gather those who believe in Him. No man can save the world now. Turn to Jesus today and ask Him into your life. Only Jesus can save you.   Millions of people are going to disappear from the face of the Earth. The governments around the world will say that aliens have abducted them or that a nuclear warhead vaporized them. Seven years of destruction and starvation await those left behind.   One man will rise from this smoldering desolation. He will be the antichrist, Satan incarnate. Do not take his mark of loyalty in your forehead or right hand. If you do this, your soul cannot be saved from hell. This is a warning from The LORD. Don't be left behind!!!   Believe that Jesus died for your mistakes, shed His blood on that cross and rose again on the third day. Then you will be spared the apocalypse to come. Call upon His holy name and be saved today. Then you are sealed for the rapture and will escape the seven year Great Tribulation.   It's that simple. There is nothing else that you need to do, despite what some misguided people will tell you. Only believe and ask Jesus to forgive you. He loves you so much but won't force you to do anything.   At birth, you were given free will to choose either His love or an eternity in hell. That is the true meaning and purpose of our short lives on this Earth; to choose which path to take. He is all you need for the future. Not going to church or being a good person or doing good things or living a moral life or growing up in a religious family. That stuff won't get you into heaven. Jesus isn't a religion; He is life itself.   Say a quick prayer and pour out your heart to Jesus. Your life will be forever changed for the better. Peace will be upon you.     John 3:16-21  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.   Romans 10:9-13  If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”   Titus 3:3-7  At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.   John 14:6  Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”   Revelation 3:10-13  Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth. I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.   1 Thessalonians 4:15-18  According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.
L Skete
I love most of what A24 distributes, but I already feel like I can’t wait for everyone to die in this movie
Ok, but where is Jenna Ortega?
Love from the India 🇮🇳❤️
Pass
So many damn gen z stereotype catch phrases ... Who wrote this shite
"did you just fucking shoot me" "i cant believe you're making this about you" i love this already
This honestly,from the bottom of my heart looks like shit
WoW A24!!!!!! Your movies are really going down in quality at a pretty steady rate
I was not expecting Lee Pace lol
Stupid😅
Easy : K.w.  is the killer
They should play Bodies Bodies Bodies in Squid Game Season 2 Like if you agree and want an A24 + Netflix crossover
A24 done fell off. This is beyond cringe.
Ahhh Myha'la! I loved her in Industry.
This looks....not so great. Gonna pass.
Kanye is gonna hate this movie. he's tired of Skete
A24 first miss??
1:14  What are you waiting fooooorrrr??? (Spins in infinity)
CRINGE!!!!    this looks fucking awful!
That dude definitely fucks.
Amongus movie amongus movie
isnt pete davidson like 49 years old
This looks like a STRONG allegory for cancel culture, lol
The trailer did a great job at annoying me, they sound like every girl my age i hate
LEE PACE!
This is literally among us in real life
Imagine Pete Davidson being the killer
So did A24 realize they revealed a HUGE spoiler at the 0:59 mark? 🤔
Are they deleting all the negative comment lmao bruhhh
This couldn't look worse if they tried.
Isn't Pete Davidson too old for this movie?
I'm so excited to see Lee Pace playing this role 😍
Wow. Looks like shit!
Pete Davidson movie?  Pfft. 🤣  Gotta be straight up garbage.
🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Trash
wtf is this? Imao
downvote simply for the cringey SNL dude that efs with Kanye
Idk
Amoung us
Rachel Sennott is gonna kill it!!!
SKETE
I wanna be a part of one of A24’s projects man😩😩😩
Which CHARLI XCX song is this!?!?
Daddy.
This is like if we told AI to create an a24 movie for gen z based on gen z/millenials/pop culture and you know what, I think I'm here for it
Can’t wait for this
In ten years this movie will either be the tale of the century or the most cringiest production mankind has ever made.
The five women in the picture look like they should be in this movie. Good role for Petra Davidson!
This might be good. If anyone can do a funny slasher right I trust A24
Pete Davidson play Pete Davidson once again. Possibly the worst comedian of his generation.
Interestingly (or not), the trailer made me hope for everyone involved with this movie to die in real life.
SKETE
more shitty movies these studios don't know what to make anymore this is pathetic and no one wants to see it
Lolllll all the satire of these buzzwords
gAy
I’m glad that they didn’t spoil any big details about this movie in the trailer, other then the fact that Pete is still the lovable stoner we all know and love.  🦦
awful euphoria bullshit ripoff that tries to pull off as a comedy because Pete Davidson agreed to it.
This is the weirdest dark comedy I've ever seen
i might watchg this simply bc Pete Davidson
SLAAAYYYYY
Looks good! Can’t wait!
Pete looks like a sleep deprived toad.. it’s incredibly unsettling.
Dawg a24 is just amazing
At first, I was like, um no. Then I heard the dialogue towards the end and yep, I'm in.
not what i was expecting at all, very very very different from the og script but this looks so good
A film about spoilt self centered ppl getting killed count me in.
I was exited for this then saw it has pete dickingson in it 💀💀
Intense Scream vibes! Every generation should be so lucky to get a defining horror film.
Yeah, dragging this Gen is always a good thing.  But, even watching the trailer makes me want to kill every one of these buzzword spouting insta cliches.  Weird seeing Pete in this film.  He’s always looked like one of those older make a wish kids who grew up loving rap and his wish is to hang out with WuTang or something…
Really not a slasher fan, but I gotta say it piqued my interest with the humor.  Good trailer, gonna watch movie.
Who is that baddie with the blonde extensions..she is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵
FUCKING FAIL OF A MOVIE
charli xcx serving a24 realness
This the best way I can describe my feeling after seeing this trailer🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 can't wait to see this movie
This is such a good trailer.
I Love slasher movies, don't judge people for what they like PERIOD!!
Looks....  Awful
Among US in real life LMBO
AHHH YES
The least a24, a24 has been
This is an obvious jab at sensitive Gen Z & toxic social media culture… I think they’re supposed to be dense and annoying on purpose 😂
This looks so corny 😂
wack
CHARLI BABY
I like the trailer. I just wish Amandla Stenberg’s breasts didn’t take up 40 percent of the thumbnail space.   I would like to see this film on streaming, when that’s a thing.
Lmao full insufferable woman bingo at the end there gaslighting this toxic that triggered etc god damn I’m on the side of the killer
I feel like they need a character named Bo.
1:00 I think they reveled the killer.
I’m excitedddd
All of the therapy buzzwords being dropped lol I gotta see this
Really good movie. Highly recommend
Looks like vapid Blumhouse trash. Yuck.
Among Us by A24 🔥
Amooooo
Oscar award nominated actress let's gooooo!!!
find god
I'm pretty much A24's bitch at this point. So yes, I'll watch.
Tf is Skeet doing in my A24 movie
how do you do fellow youths?
Might as well say I'm Mr.Insecure Pete Davidson who prove my horse is bigger than anyone else in the movie 😏
Zoomie satire reminds me of hasans chat
Is low-key brilliant or high key cringe? Hmm. Pete Davidson suggests the latter.
I really don’t know how A24 goes from making masterpieces like hereditary, X, and Uncut Gems. Then green light films like this.
Ew
Euphoria the movie.
this looks awful
would love to see this but i fucking hate SKEET…. so its a no go for me.
Fucksake can’t Pete Davidson leave films for others so I can actually enjoy them
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was Pete Davidson that was the killer
Aside from Pete Davidson being in it, looks pretty fun.
I love this
A24 what happened, you used to make touching films like: Hot summer nights, midsommar and the florida project.
This was a great trailer. I'm already sold!
mogusmogusmogusmogusmogusmogusmogusmogusmogusmogus
A24 looks like it’s really going downhill, first X now this…
Ew I can’t stand teenagers. I can’t watch this.
I hope this goes over better than mainstream did
cringe
Skete
Gonna be honest I was expecting Olivia Rodrigo’s Brutal to play with the trailer.
ehh, one of the first A24 movies that didn’t really intrigue me
skete
Looks like among us
A24 don’t miss
generation defining satire lmaooo the scene where it was just a bunch of buzzwords
Amandla stenblerg looks absolutely stunning with this blondes dreadlocks
Pete Davidson is trash.  Zero interest.
I'm so excited this is going to be amazing!!
This ain't it cheif
this movie looks so good
Clue meets TikTok. Looks fun.
Lol dying at the you’re silencing me part
Another horror/slasher film with good reviews? We have to stan. There's no such thing as having too many good, if not decent, horror/slasher films.
Staring Pete Davidson as….Pete Davidson!
Older gen z in a horror movie. I know they're not gen z but they act like it 😂
The shiva baby actress
A24 making zoomer cringe now lol  RIP you had a good run
Is this Clímax for Coachella audience?
Damm Kanye will be complaining about this !!!
This one puts the enema in cinema.
Trash, shame on you a24 for this
new charli xcx??????????????
THE CAST IS SO GOOD WHAAAAT
It looks bad and annoying on purpose. That makes it good. It’s “satire” -everyone who thinks this looks good for some reason
I am so excited for this omfg!
Lotta buzzwords in this trailer.
LESSSSSSSS GOOOOOO 2022 is just bangers
Amandla Stenberg "i missed you"
Has Gaspar Noe seen this trailer?
charli slay
Sorry But Hard Pass
So basically it’s among us the movie 🙄
“who wants to play bodies, bodies, bodie-“ “YESSSSSSS!”
Are the characters meant to be annoying
If Pete Davidson's character dies in this, this film will become Kanye West's favorite film
Looks hilarious. Also imagine if Annie Hamilton was in it ?
Pete is a terrible actor I can’t take him seriously
looks annoying af
this looks like a game of among us but with cringey instagram gen z people being murdered so looks interesting.
I thought it was the new Gaspard Noe.
It’s simple: I see that A24 logo, I go see film.
Very interesting trailer.
this looks absolutely hilarious
A24 ONCE AGAIN!!!! I need to get casted, these movies are too good
Not A24's best tbh.  This producer liked music stop-downs way too much.
Pete needs to teach us all how to put out that vibe
This reminds me of the earlier A24 films, but with more financing. Cool to see an old style.
I was intrigued when I first heard of this because the writer of "Cat Person" was writing this, but then I went to IMDb and saw that she was just one of five credited writers on the script...  Like, how many rewrites must there have been to have that many writers? That does not bode well. It still could good, but I'm skeptical.
OH THIS IS MOTHER
"They deserved it."  Prove me wrong.
2022 lexicon galore
It's Charli Baby
All I hear is Franklin saint, BODIES BODIES BODIES !!!
this looks like shit
Scream but for college white girls
I hope they release a cut without Pete Davison. lol
The quick sequence of banter was already selling me. Then when she said "You're silencing me" to "Relax, relax" I exhaled so hard my tea splashed all over me.
Hopefully this has a good chase scene. Slashers these days just go straight ahead for the kill. I miss the thrill during chase scenes
chase sui wonders!!! loved her in genera+ion, i would honestly just watch the movie for her but it looks great full stop i can't wait to watch it
My joker movie!!
i thought that was Grimes????
It feels like Spring Breakers x Hateful 8
Why is Pete Davidson in this….
please have pete be the killer but it's actually chad from snl
Eh gen z humor. No thanks
Of course they put Pete Davidson in every single clip to get people to watch it 🤣
This looks like so much fun
Wow new Charli !
Jared is the one who fucks.
Gen Z slasher, can't wait!
this looks terrible
Goddamn I love A24.
Lee Pace is in this? This is going to be amazing.
wtf why is one of them chilling in bed covered in blood lol
Ima watch this but I'm not expecting anything great.. just some fun. It seems a lil self indulgent
This looks like a dark black comedy. A24 or not, I'm on that!
This looks like a dark black comedy. A24 or not, I'm on that!
A24 never missed  the track. Shoot moreeee.
Looking like a rare miss from A24 smh
I heard this film was A24s take on Scream, just from the editing alone I'm already sold.
Love how Petes role is small but they got him looking like the main character in the trailer to attract more people to it. LOL
Cool
If Rachel Sennot's character dies before 1.5 hrs in I'm walking out
Jesus A24 you really just emptying my wallet this year, it’s just nonstop bangers
100% sure skete will die in this
This gives me spring breakers vibes I can’t really explain it
SKETE
LOL!
No matter how old I get, I do love a good teen slasher! This looks hilarious. It's giving off Spring Breakers energies with a nice addition of horror.
Copying the scream recipe
A24 have one of the most unique,  weird, twisted, disturbing,  dark movies 🎥 in film industry.... And I love it. Please don't change to like the rest of the Hollywood (well most of them).
I'd pay gross amounts of money a month for original A24 streaming services
All the Gen Z buzz phrases in this trailer got me triggered
Pete does give off that vibe, just saying.
yikes
looks so fun!
You had me till Pete Davidson was in a scene.... Hard pass!
Idk 🤷‍♂️ basically looks like Scream movie but with Pete Davidson
Annoying future flop. Pete cannot do comedy or act. Also, why are his teeth getting bigger?
You lost me at Pete Davidson.
So it's Twitter, the movie
That house looks an awful lot like the house from scream queens
Anyone else bopping to that new Charli XCX song!? 🔥🍒
Never heard of Halina Reijn! Her vision for this movie looks awesome, can't wait to see how she brings it to life. Always love when little known filmmakers surprise you like this, looks great.
*plays a game where you get murdered and someone is the murderer.* Friends: I can't believe we are dying.
Wokey McWokeface
I don't know, I liked A24's previous slasher film  X, but this is giving me flashbacks to Spring Breakers or one of Eli Roth's movies that doesn't inspire much confidence.
A24 🥰🥰🥰  ❤️ ❤️
Lee pace and Pete Davidson? I’m in
I eas think oh lord it's Black Christmas all over again glad I was wrong
Looks like a Gen Z version of the lighthouse sequence from Battle Royale.
Getting to see skete get killed… sign me up.
A24 going downhill gradually.
Man this seems like a fun satire are 1st world Gen Z problems
pete davidson was so freaking good in staten island. can't be more hyped than this.
Spring Breakers all over, again.
Gen Z in a nutshell.
nah
This is either gonna be a hilarious critique of zoomers/chronically online behavior, or this is gonna be an insufferable cringe fest.
the beige rage strikes again lmao
This is probably the worst trailer I've ever seen from A24.
So A24 has sold out now, and is now down with the agenda?   Good to know   🙄
100/10
Any dutch people here to celebrate the first A24 movie by a dutch director.
I've been waiting for this one!!!
*Its a pass for me*
If it hasn't a24 people would already mock the movie
It looks so bad...
A24 is so self-aware, I fucking love it. Give it to me, Daddy
This generations scream? Lol
What is wrong with Pete Davidson face? 😳😂
😭😂😂😂🤌🏾🤌🏾
I can’t watch cuz SKETE is in it sorry A24 :/
Who’s writing these descriptions it’s Pete Davidson not Davison lmaooooo
Lee pace in an A24 movie, I will definitely watch this movie
Skete
happy birthday to me this looks amazing
a24 has really started going downhill....
idk, kinda looks like a scuffed CLIMAX.
No thanks
Omfg
Holy shit that editing and dialogue near the end I can’t fucking breathe.  Legit this is the only way to make fun of todays generation-just play it straight the shit that comes from those in college campuses and on Twitter.  Some would say the writing appears stereotypical-the generation this is making fun of already speak like they are in an episode of South Park.  This seems stupidly fun and hilarious.
spring breakers vibes but with pete instead. K
I love A24 movies but once in a while they drop bullshit ass film. And this one is one of them.
gaslighting. Silencing. Toxic.   This generation summed up in 3 words. Im so annoyed by these characters that idk if i wanna see this
This is loos ok shouldn’t be compared to scream at all, looks like an accurate representation of kids today but that ain’t scary. Most of us doin Xanax like that deserve to die
oh my god this looks so weird and fun, i cant wait!
Wow Pete Davidson is such a cool guy 🙄
Its giving Spring Breakers vibes in the best way possible
SKETE
I was scared of this being your average, run-of-the-mill teeny shit that people will do fan edits of but this actually looks promising!!! It's Among Us/Werewolf but written with a brilliant savage take on our generation! A24 hasn't let me down yet!
I’m so glad they were able to fit so many trendy 2022 words in here. Gaslighting, toxic, woke, silenced. Just wish the trailer was longer so they could use more buzz words for a gen Z like me 🥺
Amogus
"Starring Pete Davidson as... well, as Pete Davidson 🤷‍♂"
this should be called "gen Z, the movie"
A24 couldn’t do better then Pete Davidson? Damn, they make great movies I hope they bounce back soon
so excited for this and more movies w rachel sennott in them! side note: can we please stop casting pete davidson as the character any basic white guy could play thank u 🙏
Gentrifiying Williamsburghers from 2003 fall into a time machine behind a karaoke dive bar and are transported twenty years into the future.  We invite you, America, to witness their last gasp.
so Heathers comedy meets Mean Girls... i LOVE it
My man Pete is in it too I’m in!
Maria Bakalova!!!! but  trailer is ....hmm......................
Let the bodies hit the floor……
Very interesting cast. I will see this at my local movie theater with a wet sack of popcorn
A24s Among Us
Oh my lord
i'll be seated.
Doesn't exactly look like my kind of movie, I've enjoyed the other A24 horror movies though so I'm curious!
Skete
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to me!!!!
LMAO THIS LOOKS INTERESTING
This looks grating. The characters remind me of the ones in Zola, also released by A24. I hated that movie because I couldn’t stand how the characters talked and acted. These characters, based on the trailer, look to be just as annoying. I do like Pete Davidson though and thought he was great in The King of Staten Island.
I had the chance to be a critic for this movie, and let’s just say that the tomatoes aren’t rotten.
They got Skete ? Say it aint so!
Poor Lee Pace, he deserves so much better.
This looks extremely annoying. Yikes.
This trailer didn’t get me like Most of the A24 trailers but I’ll Still check it out
Did you just fucking shoot me? I can't believe you're making this about you!
The sequence of editing at 1:06 - 1:14 sold me on the film alone.
Kind of getting a Black Christmas vibe with a Gen z spin, just without the Christmas lol
90 minutes of annoying millenials ... no thanks
This is like Among Us
this is the most excited I've been for a movie since promising young woman
If Euphoria and Clue have a baby.
Am I the only one who liked satirical humor here? They are throwing standard phrases during arguments, it's like the first one who said that the rival is toxic - wins. Or I'm looking too deep into something what contains nothing.
*PETE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!!!*
Even gen z horror films by a24 looks beautiful can't wait.
a24 rlly spoiling us with quality filmssss, totally here for ittt🙌🏻😌
I'm reading the title in Franklin's Ego Voice. But it's basically Among Us the movie.
here before it trends A24 makes the best movies ever💯
Who's gonna give me the Pete free cut (Don't get me wrong, I hate Kanye as much as the next guy - Pete is just like MGK to me...) Cringe free edit plz
All those beautiful social media buzzwords, can't wait to see this lol
Please tell me this isn't another Spring Breakers?
can we stop including pete davidson in stuff please?
Midsommar Hereditary A ghost story X The lighthouse The Vvitch                 .........you rock A24.
CHASE SUI WONDERS IS GONNA CARRY THIS MOVIE
Snooze
YES! THIS is the film we NEED rite now !! A24 u truly have becum the elite tastemakers for intelligent cinema. Bravo and i cannot wait to cry beautiful crystal tears at the empty 8pm showing of this one !!!
This is pretty wild! I’m in!
do i hear Charli XCX?
Not to knock on the editors(it might be intentional) of this trailer but at 1:10-1:11 you can see the blonde girl clearly murdering someone by hitting them in the back of the head. Maybe this was intentional or it doesn't give a anything away
Looks like I shouldn’t take it serious so as long as it’s funny
I'll be honest, this looks like it's going to be... eh. The dialogue sounds like something straight out of a twitter user
"Among us: The movie"
Pete Davidson is unbearable
hmmmm not exactly what I was expecting…
Bodies, Bodies, Bodies is like Ready Or Not!
FINALLY!! I can’t wait; we will be tuning in!!
so this is Among us the movie
AYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Not fucking pete davidson again spare us
What an ugly, toxic and unpleasant vibe this movie has... Staying at the same room with these people for five minutes, would make me want to retreat to a mountain temple for a decade.
AHHHHHFFHFFHFFHFFHFFHF I WONT NOT BE SHUTTING UP ABOUT THIS MOVIE LMAODOOO A24 THANK U FOR ANOTHER GEM
Some of this looks like wayyyyy over the top "look how dumb Gen Z are!!!!" satire that just doesn't ring true. But I do like the kinda cultic rave vibe this has going on - reminds me of Climax (the Gaspar Noe film)
a24 it's not what it used to be :/
Hmmm... not sure about this one. I guess it could be good but seems more like a Netflix stream than A24 must see.
BOOO SKEET BOOOO SKEETER
OMG, I Have Been waiting for this since I  heard it premiere at SXSW!!! Get into it  YESSSS : )
It's A24... I'm hyped
Just slap a24 at the start of the trailer and I am already there.
Is that Charli XCX playing in the background?? 👀 Excited for the movie!
so all that shit wit skete was jus him promoting himself
cringe
A24 is having one hell of a year!   X   After Yang  Everything Everywhere All At Once (the best movie of the year)   Men   Marcel The Shell With Shoes On  The Whale   Disappointment Blvd.   And now Bodies Bodies Bodies
Why do all these gen z movies and shows seem so fucking cringe
Gonna be a no for me
The Gen Z of it can't be more blatant lol
Well Pete Davidsons character is the only one i wasnt annoyed by so I hope he is the killer 🤣🤣🤣
A24 is out of this 🌎 🗺 🌏 🌐 🌍 🤯🤯🤯🤯
1:26-1:33  Perfect analogy for why Pete Davidson gets all the women, especially Kate Beckinsale and Kim Kardashian.
Can’t wait
I was lucky enough to view a test screening of this last year and can easily say Rachel Sennott was the funniest character. You are going to LOVE this movie.

Looks like woke trash!
pop culture slasher a24??  GO GET MY MONEY 💰💰💰
IM GOING FERAL
A24 creating another fun slasher I’ll take it!
Looks like Pete Davidson is playing Pete Davidson.
“It would be so obvious if I was the killer” imagine if it is Pete Davidson killing everyone that would be funny and interesting 😂
I would actually participate in that game and win most of the time. Movie looks interesting tho
Maria Bakalova is super talented and Borat was a perfect breakthrough role for her. I'm always curious what else she's gonna do next and i'm glad that she land a role for an A24 movie
Yeah this looks like my type of movie
Looks like a pass. What's going on A24. Had such a good record up to now don't start messing it up.
Y’all come out with a movie every month!
Skete Davidson is in this
honestly just here for Lee Pace
I find it neither funny nor terrifying.   But for curiosity’s sake, I’m hyped.
Masterpiece incoming
