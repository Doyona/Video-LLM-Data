Wack music for wack people. This music blows and pink fell off 😅
I can honestly and gratefully dance with joy. Protecting like gold any personal inspiration is my life's mission. I'll never betray my soul again. Never. Thank you for reminding me.
Pink NGNDA😊
When I listen to this song, especially at 0:32 , 1:31, it hits hard. It reminds me that life is ephemeral and that the dignity of those who grow old and fragile deserves respect.
Love You P!NK !!!!!!! 💗
Dancing like nobody's watching over here. Cuz nobody is. ;) I can't get enough of this song!!
I love this song. I found it today rounding on week 1 of grieving the loss of a friend. I have 4 jobs, 4 classes, a funeral next week, midterms, and probably 3 other tests. And this could not have come at a better time. I’m still lost and sad and all the big feelings but at least for this moment I am crying with happiness and laughter because of this song.   Pink never stop being unapologetically kind, creative, awesome and you. You keep my hopes and dreams resuscitated and I cannot thank you enough. Happy s***show of a 2025 everyone. Happy October. 😭
Wohard
Ti adoro! 😂😍🇮🇹😘

I honestly think pink 🩷 is the best artist of all time because I've never heard anything bad about her and her music isn't filling with cult like negativity she had always had this never ending good positive vibes only ❤🎉ty pink we love you so much 🙏💕
So f** Best❤❤❤
That really does look like Chappell Roan at 1:20

Ich liebe dich Pink ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
This! ❤ the very first time I viewed this, I shared it with my sister (stage 4 breast cancer—still fighting as of the date of this comment) and my uncle (lost his fight to stomach and pancreatic cancer June 28, 2025). This is absolutely THE fight song for anyone, because life is too short to not value the moments we cherish the most.
Merci ma belle pour cet éternel adage, il m'a sauvée la vie!!💚
I love you pink
this was time wasting, yes its tekkz🥶, but he was in a corner when time was running out and did an unnecessary rainbow, he also got other warnings that match
You ever feel like your on the Truman Show…
I'd give up my shoes of any kind before I'd give up my dog.
2023 miss me
This sounds so good
excellent
Pink definitely has…. A brand
Kids bop sang this
# ONE SINGER 🎶💋😎🎇🎇🎇
Everybody listens the music of this GARBAGE
Never say never
❤
Congratulations
When I hear this song, I hear all the sampling tracks from an old craptastic Casio Casiotone. The lyrics must've been pulled from some wallflower 14 year old's angst filled diary of diarrhea. And that song title is from some prepubescence bottom lip pushed out pain in the ass. Hell Pink won't even be remembered anymore than Mall wonder Tiffany. I'm sure the choregraphed dance number includes lots of "Jazz Hand" too. The Nickelodeon Tween crowd is Pink's lifeline no doubt. Duh...Duh...Duh...Dum...Dum...Dum... DUMB DUMB....never not gonna be DUMB! Can't really call this song "Lyrics" filled. Every mall and mall food court and panera's plays this worst than elevator music barftastic Tween selection incessantly.
2:12 SHACK IT GIRL 🎉
Pink …u know u my boo, my stank, my heart, my sis (in my head lol) ….please please please make one more R&B album !!!!!!!!!!  I beg!!! For the beginning fans!! 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Shit, ive been there wanting to shake the fuckin cashier
Never Gonna Not Dance Again is a great song
Why is this video the first thing that pops up when I google voice search pearl necklace
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME!!!!😍
No teda neviem ako svisnut ..? Ale pesničku dam
Me and my mom and my hubby and my best friend want to go to see pink in concert it like in September 24,2023 was the best day of our  life because my mom was there with us she love pink and her songs ever since my mom plows I was going to pink and bananas and people saw all the time and I feel like every time I hear a pink song my mom is always with me
Love this song so much and it is such a shame that she use it to condition her viewers to take a political stand; anyone enlightened has realised that to be free and openminded you have to free yourself and your mind from the left side of politics; with all their labels, DSM-diagnoses and division of people into small groups of false belonging; undefining yourself to just BE authentic. She might not see it herself, because she might not be geopolitically knowledgeable enough; but she is doing propaganda FOR pharmaceutical industry and transhumanism with that flag at the end. Why does she choose to soil this beautiful TIMELESS masterpiece with something so deficient as the leftist propaganda and transhumanism...I hope she wakes up from that bubble and see how beautiful this world and planet really is beyond her limiting default beliefs.

Hurts my mom was the same age as Pink😢.
That's. Your. Question ok. Pinks. The. Coolest. Love. Her
Who's in 2025 🎉👇
My mom passed 3 weeks ago today and she loved pink so much and this song fits her so well. She loved to dance and she didn’t care who was watching or who said anything! Now she’s dancing in heaven 😭. I was so thankful to see her in concert October 2024, w my beautiful momma🩷
Laten we een kleine weddenschap maken, als jij dit liedje nog kan afspelen als de bommen hier vallen en alles in ruines is, als ik op me knieeen aan het janken ben omdat alles om me heen is vernietigd en mijn familie en vrienden weg zijn, dan ben jij de ultieme Heer. Hoest dat?
Awful song 😂
Love. And. Prayers. Kenny. Beans😢
Is Pink the real  life harlequin 🤔
The optimistic vibe of this classic got me through my hospital operation in 2022, I remain very fond of this song.
I remember when this came out. Was still in the minutes. I was in the same place (bed because it's night time, lol) when this came out and I'm sure I commented back then. Lol.  This really brings me back though.  It's crazy how music can transport you to another time.
💙
Her fits so preppy in this mv❤
2010s vibes i luv it
😮
Got to make a pruchase. The stuff i got here a while back that was for my personal use. Urs will be new. Promise.
Saw her live at my first concert, and she classically stopped to eat twizzlers😂
I heard this at grad nite
she has the softness and understanding of a great mum and the viciousness of a yard dog
Pink, I love this song a lot. It's very fun and moving. Way to go for you in a great way!
All. Right. Now. Miss. Pink. IC. Ya. Girl. With. Yo. Bad. Self

One of the greatest, most dancable and singable songs ever created. Ever! Thankyou Pink. Namaste
We love you ❤ 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Please, please, PLEASE can somebody help me with my confusion?!  During the party at the end, first of all the tantrum girl seems to disappear from the store, but that’s not the confusing part…. After pink dances in that guy‘s face and they all start to chase after her and she goes shit, why did she go shit? isn’t that what she wanted?  She was “baiting” them to join in and enjoy the wonderful grocery store’s benefits, since they were all hanging around outside, roasting themselves nicely… Dan aka…ps can somebody please help a dumbass(standard version) man like me solve this riddle?! pretty please?
Love love pink ❤
Must be the worse song ever from Pink.
I like pink, but this song is not it
Let's be honest new music doesn't sound good anymore bring back older music
IM P

Come on P I N K 👏 ❤

So funny ❤❤🎉
Am Yisrael Chai🇮🇱🙏🫶🙏💪💪💪 this is such a vibe, love you, Pink ~Shayna Punim~ 💙💙💙
P!nk is my frigging hero and always has been. When I was recovering from my eating disorder I looked to P!nk to regain my self confidence
I love this song❤❤
I listen to P!nk to deal with the stress of the day. I hope P!nk has her own method of dealing with life these days.
Pink you aced this one. I love your music🇮🇪💕

*Let me see if I understand this correctly:* Grammarlys writing assistant pitch is: _“If you’re too stupld to do your own homework, just ask us, and we’ll do it for you!”_  Would someone mind explaining to me how *I’m* supposed to get stronger by asking *someone else* to lift the weights *for* me?   _“Never think for yourself again!” _  What could *possibly* go wrong?!?   Good luck, humans. You’re ﬁnna need it.

A TRUE ARTIST !
I just like the song.
My mom says that this is my theme song
Tan car..with swirlling  Maurice shoes..hospise
This song in my mantra. I'm chronically ill and getting very frail as I continue to progress in my illness and this song inspires me that this spirit of enjoying me for me right where I am and always remember to dance like no one is watching is really keeping me alive and happy especially on the bad days. I'll put my ear buds in and just dance my heart out andxthi song is always one of the first ones I listen to to get my mood up and put me in that right frame if mind!!! Plus I just ADORE Pink anyway. There are a whole bunch of her songs that speak straight to my heart and she sings my life with her words!!
Give me a reason not to...non❤❤❤❤
I love you so w
P  😅😅t
Thankyou pink you remind me to be me

August of 2020, my mom passed away in her sleep. I was only 20 years old, in an abusive relationship, and due to the pandemic, I couldn't grieve with my friends around me. everything was at both a stand still, and time just kept moving forward. 2 years later, I'm in a better relationship, moved out of my childhood town and living with the first man that actually loves me, everything was fine, and I was just trying to shove down the grief of my mom. I just knew that she would want me to live my life, and not wallow in her memory, until one night, I'm driving home with my radio on trying to get home at 1:00 at night from work, and this song comes on. my mom loved dancing to her music, and she really liked pink, next thing I know, I pulled over to the side of the road because tears were welling up in my eyes, and I couldn't see. this song sounds like something my mom would of blasted in the kitchen and would dance to, even with her busted foot! I love this song, but I cant listen to it without hearing my mom singing along, and she hasn't even heard this song before she died, I just know that she would love it. thank you pink, for giving my mom another song to dance too in the afterlife.
❤
Your outfits were so cute!
Happy new 2025 to everyone that had a difficult 2024🎉
Today is 2025/01/01🎉🎉🎉😊
NO leave my dog as well
So, pink...sowilo means the sun.  Health and prosperity.  Actually it is really kind of all the things together.  So maybe you should name your kid willow.
Feel inspired to dance!  Let's embrace bootscootin' boogie, jiving Rock and Roll, FunK with the flair and grace of timeless classics, the Charleston, mashed with old school RnB to really wake up, shake up the Youth Of The Nation (P.O.D)
2013 trow love 2015 try  2022 dance agen
No matter how bad I'm feeling, I listen to this song, and I'm happy again, even if it's just for 4 minutes. Thank you, @pink

My anthem... love some pink🎉🎉🎉🎉
I LIKE HER BETTER THAN TAYLOR SWIFT
❤❤❤❤❤❤  a real fun and catchy song. Brilliant video, real 80s / 90s vibe to it. Love it. Love pink❤❤
Doesn’t everyone wish they could dress like an early 2000s animated character instead of a silly pop music video from those years, and run around the grocery store while shopping and dancing, when they shop? LOL at the kid eating in the middle of the store. He looks too nice to be a thief. He bought it, I know. What a cutie.
Thats my gurl!! I luv to watch her dance 💃
1:35 Hi everyone! This is ME playing the construction worker. Never stop dancing!
I always used to wonder at the groove.  People dancing so close together.  I think for me I pump out the old break beats on my mini disk and dance in the street alone as I walk on by.  I always wanted to see another soul in the city walking by.  I got to try not to tap the the ground and wirl to high.  Never know what it takes to be a mage in this world and get on the black leather and walk down the street again trying not to dance to much to mini disks still going and never knowing what is new for time
is that Chappell Roan in this video?
Finely a song that reflects my thoughts ❤😢
PIINK IS A FUNKY GREAT AT PLUCKING HITS LIKE THIS ❤50YYEAR OLD LAD 💘😘🇮🇪 2:51
Sometimes I am not that crazy about Pink, but this song is great!!!    We all need to lighten up and carry on with our lives after this very devastating COVID epidemic.

Anyone 2025? 🎉
It's a shame they took the AMA performance of this song off YT, I wanted to see it again
Super rola market, just skating 😂🎉❤
This song was a blessing for me! Helped get me through a really tough time!!! Thank you soo much! Your music has helped me soo many times in my life! You rock! ❤
Saw Pink two days ago on tour. And this was one of the biggest songs I needed to hear, to experience live, and to dance to. In the aftermath of the election results, not even 24 hours since it was called, what I needed more than anything was permission, from myself, and from the world, to dance for a bit. To forget just how hellish it was outside the venue doors, just for a few hours. So glad I finally got to sit down and see this show, after years of loving the music. Thank you, for putting out so much energy right when it's needed most.
Listen every time, non stop 🥳♥️🙏🌏
I forget how many good soñgs shes done
Now that's nobody's damn beeswax how you raise your children Ms Adams! 🎉
Wundervoll ❤! Inspirierst, gibt's Kraft als Person!  Dein Video sagt mir " Wieder Rollschuhe anschnallen "! Hoffentlich klappt es mit 57, noch sooo locker 😂!

I love this song and this video, but I have to ask, why are the pride flags upside down at 1:28?? Am I missing something?
I saw her last night and had a religious experience truly the best show I have ever seen and I have seen some of the best.  Another ✓ off my bucket list. If you can go see her do it you will not be sorry.

PLEASE, DEDICATE PERFECT TO HER, SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT SHE IS THE GREATEST GIFT I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE AND SHE IS PERFECT. SHE LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF ME. SHE WON'T ADMIT IT, BUT SHE DID

My daughters love this song
The best song I ve heard for years!!! And Pink is so damn pretty!!! ❤️
Thank you pink for this song. I’m going back to dancing. 🥰
Love the music ❤❤❤
I get in trouble  at work.
Singing and dancing on rollerskates; that's part of what makes P!nk the greatest.
Frozen dinners is not good for your health
You can't even be mad listening to this song. I was in Wawa bout to steal but this song came on and I couldn't even do it. Bought a pack of king size starburst and told em keep the change
LGBTQABCDHDTV...bleh.
Makes me want to cry. Fractured my hip dancing to fun house in my kitchen. Slipped on my clean floor. Only hope I can sing this 😊
This song has gotten me through my younger passing away.
Sad and washed up. Grasping for straws
I love this song and it has become my fight song as I battle stage 4 colon cancer.  I am going to live and I am going to continue dancing!!!  Love this upbeat song.  Anytime things get rough this is going to be on!!!
I actually like this song and am not into white people music.
OMG I am 1 year late. One of your best videos, and I love skate, gosh is like freedom.
This song could have been totally amazing.. why didn't they spend 10 extra minutes to write some decent lyrics!!!! It feels like such a wasted opportunity.  Is this really the best they could come up with? The music and energy is sensational, but the lyrics are so lazy and I can't even play for my kids.. now it's just a throw away song instead of the anthem it could have been :(
Paiaiaiaix tu te rappelle le chien en 2012 j'ai pas survecue jusqu'a un certain point. Seta seta nyokez niokez jusqu'à un certain point c'est à niokez niokez ? Mefiez vous des kléps
this song and music video puts the biggest smile on my face Love u pink

ik vind pink de max
This Song is SO getting Me getting Mr "out of my head today"
Uninspired tripe, song infuriates me
This song sucks fight me
So the first time I heard this song, I thought for a second it means more than just "dance again",. then for a second I realized art itself; composing, singing, dancing, editing, is just more than a wish., if used for good and to create employment.. Otherwise it's just another superficial luxury with no real trasendence.. Anyhow cute outfits, this one song has deepth! #PINK #NeverGonnaNotDanceAgain #OfficialVideo #2022 #2024USA❤🧡💛💚💙💜
My victory song.  Pink never stops letting me down.  Flawless is good!
The kid I the beginning looks like podcast from goats busters

My favorite line: We've already wasted enough time. I love your energy and your art, P!nk!
I was thinking I should not dance  again but  now I think I'm never gonna  not dance again❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I love PINK!!!! Always!!! 🥰🥰
My inspo, still young so I’m def gonna grow up like her, just having fun, not caring what other people think.

Every time I see or hear her, I feel as good as I can. She' s how I wish I could live.   It's not gonna happen because I am me. But I will try to be inspired. Thank you, Pink! ❤

P!nk is a gift to our generation. Thanks babe.💐

Muito top 😘❤
Amazing just amazing, i love it from Elena his daughter 😊
Your music is all the same, you need you find new Inspiration
is anyone here in 2024? 🤩🤩
Lyrically I dont care for thos song it doesnt do anything for me [my opinion]  Thats the negative   The positives Ive been listening to MTC much music and everything eles sence I was 9 years old Im 33 I have 18 years plus in the music area, and with that being daid ita my opinion that This song instrumental wise is nothing short of a master piece of amazing orchestrated genius.  I cant believe its on the raidio. At some points its like a freaking Disney song. Abnormally good.  I love this songs instrumental and vocals.
Time for dicsco heaven now 😉✌️. Still te amo ❤️
The food truck is the best part for me,,, al.   Call me betty
I love this song and I was crying when she played it at the concert
I love this song and i,m sorry that your husband died 😢 i,m never going to dance to the fact that tour husband died

Love this song ❤
Still accomadating.  Better straight night.. here u are comfy.

This is for my best friend Lesley Armitage...I love and miss you my friend, we danced to the end of your life, so happy we went to TITP 2013, for my 40th - you passed away a few years later 2 days after your 50th birthday :(  dance in sky until we meet again xxx I miss you chic xxx Your Best Friend, Your Soul Mate, my Sister from another mother lol, still can't believe you are gone, but you live in my heart xxx

This is my Mantra song.  I love to dance and will dance anywhere and to almost anything.  Life is about having fun and living life to the fullest. Pink's music has always brought me joy. Took my grandson to his 1st concert to see her in October. We had so much fun.

typical dropshorts🤣
Damn, girl sure can dance on those skates. Very cool moves !
Oh no, that kid at the beginning is doing the devil horns, with both fingers!!
I love most of Pink's songs. Hard relate. But why did she choose such skimpy clothes for this video? The choreography is amazing, and the wardrobe choice distracts from that.
1:28 ❣🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
This song gives you motivation to keep on keepin' on.
girl thats so true im never not gonna dance  again . And hell yeah i have 0 f**ks .  love you girl
i love you p!nk.  I  have loved you since i was 2 !
This Video: Brings to Life such a powerful message..... HOPE is such a powerful force #2024
“Never gonna lap dance again!”
I love you pink ❤🇺🇲
This is my fav song...anthem! ❤ The lady in the parking lot w her friend smoking..red sunglasses on her head....reminds me of the late Kirsty Ally 😢
I just played this song in “The Voice of Germany” (I’m a musician), we had so much fun!!! Didn’t know it before, absolutely love it, watched the video now three times in a row and it just puts me a big smile on my face ✨💕💖🔥😊 And I dance!! Thank you very much, Pink!!!🙏
Seeing the music video makes me even happier to hear this song 3 times a day working at a grocery store for minimum wage.
How come did we let this song flop? 😢
Co Ty robisz kobieto ! Magia!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
LOVED THIS CHICK ALL THE WAY NACK INT HE LATE 90'S WHEN I WAS A MINOR. I AM FUCKING 40 NOW. SHE LOOKS YOUNGER THEN ME HAHAH OLL
Conserva todo desde los 90 la adoro❤
I also want to roller skate in the shop without receiving warnings.  Even if I'm useless
❤
Isso é um crime! Uma música dessas com uma Artísta foda como a Pink e só ter isso de vizualisaçâo?? Eu heim, o mundo ta doido mesmo.
I love your songs especially this one thank you for keeping it real ❤

I'm never gonna not P!nk again❤
1:24 look at those guys at the background, clapping so hard, that girl should know better than to be using her phone while working
P!NK has no idea how she brings people together!
Excuse me try mr lords not tonight explain I want that explained don’t fucken try me
Watching this makes me feel closer to my loves that left. My aunt the woman I could trust with all my secrets and who help me come out to my parents. She always told me “as I know your safe and dong well, I’m here (my heart) with you everyday. Both my grandparents, they were my rock and the corner stone to the family. I hate not hearing theirs voices or just a simple “I love you”. It diggs into me every time. @P!nk your music got me through the toughest shit in life since I heard that Rockin’ voice. Album “M!ssundaztood” thats my pill to keep on rollin’ and F**k those that hate. P!nk I F love you.
My happy place for 4.01 minutes.😂❤🎉
I've just ran faraway from DV it Herts but 14years is enough of pain n suffering my life will never be the same even my family don't care slot has happened I've nearly died twice I just want some one to hear me I don't no how to get through life any more I hate that people are so horrible to say nasty things and hakke people s identify I don't no how to get my life back  it's so hard some times I close my eyes and think my times coming close to see my mum that is now flying with the angles I dream of one day to be able to not be seared and lonely mum was Wright all my family are only got one thing on there mind is greed they can have it all I just want to smile n see my kids n grandkids I hate technology it's cruel I hope some one    out there will understand me
Pink is the only artist I've seen through the years that keep being true to herself and we all love her for it
Pink really goes through the decades being relevant.
I am sitting here listening to this with my daughter, bc we absolutely love you!!! ❤ The best part is she has been practicing how to blow bubble gum bubbles for a really long time, and she says "look Mom, I can blow bubbles like P!NK" !!  I knew right at that very moment she felt like the coolest girl, ever! ♥️💞❤️😊🎉
Wish life was as easy as make believe movies, actors, & actresses😔😢
Allá love guys😂❤ great CD pink never dissapoints.
Thank you, ANYBODY!!!!❤🎉😂😊
Like the song 🎶
For acme, oh thank you. Say that twice and mean it ❤
I just want to listen to you 24/7! Please adjust the settings so that when Pink's videos are over that it sends us to another Pink video. <3
*NEVER* gonna *NOT* dance again? nobody *DOESN'T NOT* cares!

I just have to watch this again and again!
Uh that, Gonna.
Never gonna not dance again, let the music play till the end❤
💖👍😎👏💃
Dearest Pink,  I am a mentally and physically disabled 56 year old woman. I will only get worse as I grow older. My treasured husband who is 59, goes to work every single day and then he has to take care of me, our two cats, which are brothers, and does all the housework and all our errands. Now because I’m disabled I truly don’t do go anywhere except to my doctors and my hubby takes time out of work to drive me to all my appointments. I used to go to concerts and bars and dance my heart out but now it’s difficult to walk without a cane, walker or my husband’s arm. However when I met my hubby he was a blues man and a heavy metal head. So I started to get him to listen to pop/rock music and this I swear on my God above, he loved you from the first song I ever played him. We watch your videos and when he goes to work, I watch a lot of your interviews etc. Now we decided together that if you came to Alberta, Canada we would do anything to get tickets and I tried for hours to do just that. Since we live paycheck to paycheck we don’t have monies to get updated cellphones or iPads. Because the websites are so advanced... I couldn’t get into the apps to download on my iPad mini 4. I tried on two other cell phones but in the end we couldn’t get tickets. We both have had an extremely bad year. My husband’s mother, 92, is currently in hospital because she has severe dementia and broke her leg twice and now she can’t walk at all. Plus there have been issues with my 2 sons involving alcohol and drugs. I suppose I just wanted you to know that us hippies are not going to be there in Edmonton, Alberta next August. I was more than willing to go through all the physical pain to see you. My husband is really disappointed too believe that. I just think everyone is so into technology and people are forgetting that it doesn’t work for us little people. The last time I went to a concert you could still buy tickets on the phone or go to a ticket store. You definitely can’t actually speak to someone on the phone anymore. Well I guess I’ve rambled on and the odds of a reply are 1 in a million. Just please know that we will remain huge fans and that I actually have prayed for you and your family. May your family be safe and sound in everything you do Pink.   Thank you, Kat and Dog (Katrina and Douglas)  P.S. I have zero idea where to send this so I’m just posting wherever I can actually go to online. Twitter, Instagram and TikTock I cannot get on their websites either.
I don't understand how this song is not viral! It's MAGIC!!
😄good.now stupid fucking ad.#sing it!💪💖👏👍😎😌😊🙂
What I love about P!NK's videos is that they are so real and always incorporate different types of people, and not only perfect dancers or models. It just perfectly reflects of her nature as human being!!!
Wirkt alles total bezahlt keine normalen Leute🤮🤮Früher war Die echt cool... Mittlerweile ist das alles so gestellt und ekelhaft...aber ist bei fast allen so!!! Geld, Geld, Geld das zählt bei denen🤮🤮🤮
My motto to life problem+❤
She needs to put more thought into her lyrics
You are so praty❤and you're muzic is praty❤❤
I love this song ❤
The day this video came out was the day I knew I had to ask for a divorce. I should have never married a man who would tell me to stop dancing at the grocery store, all those years ago.
So I just googled “never not gonna dance again is a terrible song” the music videos came up first so I watched it and now I think it’s my favorite song!
I Love This Song  I love you Pink ❤️
Pink is oñe bad ass girl and a positivé and loving person that expressed her awesome brand and wasn't afraid to leave love bétter yet was stíll able to recognize evéryone should be loved. I'm pretty sure she is as rough with her  man as she uses him in almost evéry spot that only needed a pretty man.
This was my mums favourite singer but my mum sadly passed away to brain cancer and her birthday is tomorrow rip love you so much 🙏❤️😭
❤
K     . .?             .
Love pink me and mum always listen to her
Been repeating this song countlessly❤❤❤❤
I absolutely Love this !!!!
This song made my baby start walking 😂😂😂 she loves it so much
Good song to sing and dance too! Well done Pink!
This video is so magical. You can’t help but feel better after watching this. Just a bunch of normal looking people and weirdos hanging out grooving together! And of course, P!nk continues to be the mother of badass pop. Fashion icon forever ❤️ I wonder if she knows how much she’s saved people with her authenticity…..
I'm 80  I wish I had learned this decades ago.   It would be a great tatoo.
Good.  Fight.   Story.   Deep.  In  side
Still my favourite pink record beaut she is
❤🎉❤🎉❤
Such fun!
Love P!nk 🩷
WoW❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hab sie live in Berlin erlebt....eine unvergessene Bühnenshow...Du hast es einfach cool drauf Baby💖💖💖Weiter so
Meh
Great she is a virgo
I love P!nk! She just gets better and better! ❤💜🥰❤💜🥰
There really is no one cooler than Pink!!💯
This has become my new anthem. I'm 67, live with arthritis, and I will never not dance again.

♥️👸🏼💎🌌🦚🦋🌻
MUEVA MUEVA MUEVA! I love her so much! -
❤ I always ❤ this. 🎉 Just amazing .
I love how Pink has always stood out to every generation and not caring what other thought keep being you Gil God gave you this gift keep up with it all
💃🏽✨💓🕊️    🤙
I think we should always stand for ourselves of the mornings of afternoon of the evenings the mornings to get it started afternoons in case we're having a rough day and the evenings to celebrate that we made it life is too complicated without dance without music
This song is such a bop
Who
I lost my Bride os 29 years to her 3rd bout of cancer in 2022. We did ballroom dancing for many years. I will dance again when I am with her. Until then I will not dance again. Rest easy Carolyn, I'll be along when it's my time Angel,. I will always be your husband. Even Death can't change that. I love you with all my heart.
GOD bless your soul. AMEN
J'adore Pink. Le clip est trop bien ❤️♥️💙💚💛💜❤️♥️💚💙💛💕💖💚💙💛💚❤️💓💞💓💖💕💜💙💚💛❤️💞💓❤️💙💓💕💞💖💛💙❤️💞💖💛💙💓💕💛💓💜💙❤️💞💖💖💛💙💙💙💜♥️💙
Love je kiff trop ❤❤❤❤
Amazing song
I’m recovering from Covid in 2020. I got debilitating long Covid. This has become my theme song. I will never miss a moment again
Just love it so much ❤❤❤
I absolutely love this. The video, the song, your completely unapologetic and pure personality, and just you as a human being. This song made me tear up as it reminds me of my aunt because even in her 60s and struggling with leukemia she still danced in the aisles when we went shopping. She passed away a couple years ago and I'm still struggling with it. Just Give Me a Reason was one of her favorites.
I am listening to Pink from when I was 10years old and she never disappoint. Love her music
How much I love this woman thank you for many uplifting songs 😢
So much fun...breaking out the skates...always dance...
I sow this video 100 times.
#NeverGonnaNotDanceAgain #PINK
A TRANSGENDERED MAN IN DRAG.
I would love to start a dance riot. New life goal unlocked
Maravilhosa ❤
3:27  that gets me a spit take laugh every time 🎉😂❤
I love that P!nk likes to fight people :)
Great hit ❤🎉
P!nk said in a interview that her dance sequence is a homage to her “Most Girls” video. Its at 1:53 ❤
I just Love this woman! <3
Would you ever make a dance workout video? I would buy it!
This song speaks to my soul (as trite as that it is) and realeases all stress from adulting. Dancing is joy. This is one of my anthems.
PINK WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BIG BOY AT THE BEGINNING?
Squizophrenia everybody wanna jump on me and read in my Jesus mind
P!NK is our queen
You are amazing Pink! I love and loved your concert!
thats it and this is it
Gosto da Pink, mas nesse clipe deixaram a desejar muita lacração e pouca qualidade como telespectador posso opinar 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Who said disco's dead?
My daddy died last week. This is the first time I’ve smiled since. Thank you.

Listened to her Hurts to be Human album (again) then her Trustfall album......!!! What a change in her soul......word!!!
FEEL GOOD TRACK OF THE YEAR  !!!! 💃💥
I need to hear this song because it possibly reminds me of my Uncle Kurt dying of a heart attack. There has been a breakup between my older brother Joel and his girlfriend and my close friend Ainsley. So now, I’m sad and I’m upset and I’m down in the dumps and, I thought she would stay longer and be around and I wish she would stay longer and be around and I’m in my bedroom crying onto my pillow
UNDERRATED SONG!
My mom loves you ❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love this dance track, well done KEEP DANCING GIRL,just love you and this new cd!!!

Моя любимая певица.
I wish this song would stop playing at Tesco's I'm so sick of it lmao 😂
Some mentals on here.
Don't try to recreate this in the grocery store...now that I am older I realize people are lame to real lyrics.... omaha package mo's aka more shoes...look for them.

i love pink to❤
#cityfm89 aired this song... love it !!!
I wish you knew how much i love you and so does the world, from my teenage years to date you still get me or is it that i get you😄😄. Love you and i wish you all the best in everything you do. Don't never dance again🫶🏾
You are an inspiration!  ❤
She is so energetic and fun!
Love this song.   Thanks Pink!
Muy bonita canción ❤
Wow that lady can go thanks pink your song changed my mood I love this song❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pink wrote this song for the album, and I f*ckin love it... its our favorite! No wonder your name is P!NK HART!💃🏼 💗💖👯‍♀️🕺🩰
❤❤❤ 😮
I absolutely love this so much. I had to stop dancing 20yrs ago after I ended up getting diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both my hips and a heart condition that could cause a sudden heart failure at any time called Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia where my heart works overtime and beats at over 120bpm during sleep. Unfortunately, the only enjoyment from dance I get now is by watching it on tv or when its on music videos like this. I was dancing from the age of 3yrs and im 45yrs now.
She is beautiful inside  and out xxx
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
P.s  the message in this song is soooo true, blackwolf
God bless you Pink,"girl, you STILL got it going on"-love you, blackwolf 🐺🐾🐾
Omg I'm loving every Pink song once again just a wonderful flow of energy and her voice is spectacular love it
❤❤
A ma Claudia d amour jtm ❤
The true essence of a brilliant artist! Not only a beautiful voice but a complete, well rounded of artist with a great feel, hear and movement(with times and tides)for the love of music. Please pink dont stop your music career bring on more of this. Love you to the moon and back.A

the grocery store is a meat market; where you might find a prearranged marriage
This song is all about having fun. Love it!
If grocery stores were this fun, I’d cancel my Instacart subscription in a minute! LOVE her!
I like this!  Its a very fun and cute video.  Pink is having alot of fun here!
This seems like a song that was created for the Barbie movie but possibly got cut from the final songs. It's so good!
US and we     All remember skating where ever we got out side after school and I know they have similar life experience said French bread today and French Gates's amazing experience's and choices for our country United States of Affordable  houses LLC is the best idea ❤. Because everyone walks away with a smile and great experience overall!!! United States of America and both of our country's red and blue sides must come together no matter what or who moving forward the world starting in New York City NY State Project's being rebuilt and improved as well! MRS and Richard will always show up doing our very best. Because United, WE and US Stand together The Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates Foundation and starting this springtime??????? Love MRS Es

If you use never and not in the same sentence does that mean yes or never and not will cancel each other.
1:24 violence against critically underpaid people? .... wasting food? ... Pink, once you were cool, but this video doesn't put a good light on you.
I love she busted the roller blades....thank god

This song identifies me as a dancer on TikTok
Älskar dej som fan Pink. Du är IT. TACK!❤
Das bist nicht Du , dir würde es genügen nur zu singen, bin nur ein deutscher Altenpfleger aber ich fühle das so, good luck..
I'm 30 and i'm always wondering, do i dress too unappropriate for my age? too sexy? NO! this clip and song influences me that you need to dress the way you feel. i'm goth and i'm into short skirts, crop tops,  and leather harnesses, am i too old? this videoclip tells me what i always needed to hear, thank you! You are a great inspiration. Keep it up.
Ppl Pink has done it again. God I just love her. She always brings out real fun energy. I will always be a PFFL( PINK FAN FOR LIFE)😊❤

Germany’s Next Topmodel has a 2 second clip as its intro and I hated it because they keep repeating that one part, now listening to the full song for the first time I’m totally in love with it. 🎉🎉🎉
Desde que comenzaste a cantar que se sigo, o sea tengo muchos años ja pero lo lindo es que a tu edad transmitas esa energia, siempre fuiste muy loca y energica, me gusta verte  con la actitud que te conoci.. Saludos !!

I'm commenting on my husband's account because I plan on putting my two week notice in tomorrow as head dishwasher of a co-op I love but the kitchen atmosphere has become toxic and the work has increased without an increase in pay. I'm fifty in August and life is too short for that shit. Thank you Pink. I'm scared but I'm gonna do it.
ILOVEYOU

#BIGISLOOKINGFORME #SuicidelifeLine #Audubonzoocoffeealbinoalligator #PopARotc #MilkNHoneyChapLips #ThePaintedGOAT #WearingNothingbutASmile #LibertyBell Morning and Evening Daily Devotional by C.H. Spurgeon February, 14 (Morning) Devotion “And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.”  2 Kings 25:30   Jehoiachin was not sent away from the king’s palace with a store to last him for months, but his provision was given him as a daily pension. Herein he well pictures the happy position of all the Lord’s people. A daily portion is all that a man really wants. We do not need tomorrow’s supplies; that day has not yet dawned, and its wants are as yet unborn. The thirst which we may suffer in the month of June does not need to be quenched in February, for we do not feel it yet; if we have enough for each day as the days arrive we shall never know want. Sufficient for the day is all that we can enjoy. We cannot eat or drink or wear more than the day’s supply of food and raiment; the surplus gives us the care of storing it, and the anxiety of watching against a thief. One staff aids a traveller, but a bundle of staves is a heavy burden. Enough is not only as good as a feast, but is all that the greatest glutton can truly enjoy. This is all that we should expect; a craving for more than this is ungrateful. When our Father does not give us more, we should be content with his daily allowance. Jehoiachin’s case is ours, we have a sure portion, a portion given us of the king, a gracious portion, and a perpetual portion. Here is surely ground for thankfulness.   Beloved Christian reader, in matters of grace you need a daily supply. You have no store of strength. Day by day must you seek help from above. It is a very sweet assurance that a daily portion is provided for you. In the word, through the ministry, by meditation, in prayer, and waiting upon God you shall receive renewed strength. In Jesus all needful things are laid up for you. Then enjoy your continual allowance. Never go hungry while the daily bread of grace is on the table of mercy.

Im gonna miss humans after a.i rule .........we were a funny bunch ....
Hello
Superb. Love Pink Always
This song is so addictive. What a bop
I am wrong  to say this sounds like a Bruno Mars song?
This song was a must-have the minute I heard it on the show "That's my jam." Pink always delivers a classic and that's why she is so beloved and rightfully so.
P!nks songs are kinda cool but she needs to turn up the bass a little more
If the Bros find this on my playlist I won't even explain myself, I'll just hit play... This is irresistibly catchy 🔥
2:55
İs it can't stop the feeling?
90s vibes! Love her acknowledgment of Whitney Houston too!

I said this for Ertha Kitt and I'll say it for pink. What a woman!
Pink ia a fatnstic S8gwrun L Love you Misic
This is absolutely my favourite song at the moment, might have slid into the faves of all time now, as I'm trying to learn how to sing it, but the jump in the chorus is so hard, can't do that run down and hit the note for dance (in tune), after "never gonna not..". I don't really sing, and this song and attention has made me inspired enough to start trying to sing. But damn that note is hard to get. Seems like it's an octave jump from the word "not" to "dance"? (correct me if I'm wrong)
I loved Piink....but not anymore. She repeat herself over and over... Na-ahhh... not for me.... SO ,,one-way'',musicaly....   😞
I ❤ your song, P!NK!!!!!😊
Well-done Pink. Beautiful song .
Raw Heartfelt Talent Your Amazing Voice penetrates my heart and soul 💜🎉🌿🌹🌿🌻🦋🎤🔥😎⭐🎶🕺💃🕺💃🕺
Another banger from my favorite female singer. Way to go, P!nk!

Du bist einfach so natürlich bleib bitte so wie du bist und lass dich nicht umkrempeln❤❤❤❤❤

I was at a store and I heard this annoying "song" and I kept asking myself, "Are they trying to drive away customers?"  What a hack!

Finally accepting my autism after being diagnosed 8 years ago after a burnout forced me to do so. Working through all the things I have been taught i SHOULD  be, cause how I was wasnt comfortable for others "you'll never survive that way". Today after a fun day, this song was played and it hit hard in the most positive way. Proud of how far I have already come refinding my truth and my life vs society life. Long way to go, but this will be my soundtrack and victory song at every step. ❤ all the best to everyone ❤
What an icon!
Love it
“Never gonna not sing again” 😌😎😉😅👍🏻
What's not to love?  xxxx
masterpiece as always 💖
The waiting was worthwile ❤
Only good vibes !!! 🎊 🎉😌😉😎
So underrated artist and always with positive vibes.
Fire up this song to start your day and I'm sure you can tackle any obstacle ahead!

How ive missed your voice❤❤❤ Dont you ever quit cz as long as you sing, i'm alive❤❤❤❤❤❤
This might be the best pink song ever
Everybody should just dance, and often.
She is such a good singer
I love P!NK’s music videos, they are so good.
I love this so much. Life is too short to be embarrassed and self-conscious. Why not just throw that inhibition away and freaking DANCE! Why should I not just embrace my own freedom! I love P!nk, she’s been my idol since 9. Do you think she knows the profound impact she has on people?
On ressent comme une influence jamiroquai je me trompe? En tout cas c est sympa
4:01 is my favorite part!!

❤
Love this song !

Fantastically fantastic 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
This song saved my life. So many times. The impact she has had on my life is not able to be put into words. The respect I feel for her is just...I wouldn't be alive without her life and zest for it. I'm never not gonna dance again and be myself.
Almost 2 decades with my in-laws and they just realized hubby and I are bi.. they kicked us out of the family. Thank you for always being here for us, even though you could never know how much you help us all 💛💛
Esto es tener identidad Pink ❤ seguir con su estilo fiel yba sus fans no venderte a corrientes de este mundo Larga vida Pink alegras mis días viendo y escuchando tu música 🎶

Brilliant video🤩Just love this girl😍
I don’t know why I am smiling while I’m watching this music video. I love you so much Pink. Never stopped loving you. Thank you for giving me cheerfulness.
0:42 - 0:53 My favorite scene !!! 😂😅
She's such an inspiration she's so talented I love her for being her. She such a queen ✨
Pink is the only artist I've seen through the years that keep being true to herself and we all love her for it
Música brasileira de José Ramalha
I love that your just being yourself it’s amazing!!
Me and my mom are obsessed with your songs They are so good I love this 1 and that's all I know so far and walk me home in the dead or night I love a lot of them
me hizo a acordar a "can´t stop the feeling!". Muy buena canción...
I remember a time when I lost my dog. I turned up this song when I wasn’t shoving down my emotions in November 28th, 2022. I did not want to be there
Ich kann einfach nicht stillsitzen! 💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻 Wow, seit  „Funhouse“ ist „Trustfall“ endlich wieder ein geniales Album!!  SIE IST WIEDER DA !!!
Sorry for your loss. Lost my mother 2016. Know the feeling. Keep you in prayer. Hey, this song helps us ...take care
I love it 😊
J adorrrrrrrre💓💓🎶🎵🖒

I like old pink music sadly, this is a one time play one time forgotten song that's randomly played in convenient stores. It's background noise, I personally don't like the song, seems little effort was put into the lyrics of the track. 👎🏻, sorry pink pls put effort into your music again early 2000s era
So far one of her greatest videos ever 🎉 love every second.
She’s back😂❤😊
🩷🩷🩷
Why can't I add this version to my Playlist? Anyone have some ideas?
This song is the most insulting thing that happened to music in the past year
This song is pure good vibes and confidence🧁💛I play it everyday when I go to work.
P!nk you are just the best I don’t know how you do it all ❤
definitely a Whitney Houston level song

My mam loved this song I played it to her when she was passing away in intensive care bless her 😢
SHE IS THE MOST FUN PERSON IF THERE IS NOT A WORLD RECORD FOR THAT THEN THERE IS NOW
Du geile Kuh !!
She’s wearing baggy pants and soda shoes!!! I wore that in 1998-1999!
Je signe pour l'Amour, l'amour. D'abord moi après l'univers.
This song makes you wanna DANCE AGAIN! 😍
I have liked many of Pinks songs in the past. This song really lifts you the Trustfall album is brilliant and this is from a 76 year old just wish I could see her live.
Pure joy!  You can’t listen to this song and be anything but happy.
Promoting the US and the world to eat processed crap food. Shame on you as a role model.
This sing OH this song!💛💛💛😉
This song means so much to me. I lost my leg below the knee a year ago, and before that, I spent a year bed-ridden and wheelchair bound. I did PT to learn how to walk with a prosthetic leg, but I lost all my core muscles strength, and it's so hard to just stand upright. I'm also 45, if I were ten or twenty years younger, I'd bounce back better. I had a knee reconstruction surgery back in Jan 2011, and I had 3 months to go swimming and get myself into the best shape I could. I wasn't given this opportunity; I had a crush injury to my foot, and my podiatrist wouldn't prescribe PT for me to learn how to exercise with a damaged foot. I knew this was going to be the hardest thing I've ever done (my mom passed away unexpectedly three weeks after I got out of the hospital the first time, when I was told to no longer walk) and I found out I'm not as strong as I thought I was. But I never not want to dance again!!!

Reminds me of seeing Ashley Graham for the first time!

Pink you have your fingers on the heart of so many of us that have been under dark storms and just don't know what to feel, think or do. You are the Sunshine and Pink clouds that makes hearts smile laugh and love! Thank you for helping me to want to dance again.❤ Your strength and tenacity are contagious🔥💪❤️
So let the music play till the end. Why did it stop? (for real why did it stop)

What does she mean with: don’t care if I belong, no. Ideas?
🪩🕺🪩
💃 love this song, so fun!
I have 4 more rounds of chemo. My last round I will be dancing out of the hospital to this.
❤
I love you Pink, but this shit is stupid
ALS has taken so much from me and will eventually take everything. But it can't and won't take my joy. This adds fuel to the joy fire!! Still dancin on the inside!!!😁  ALSforLIF...
I don‘t get it!  Now, will she dance or will she not dance again??🤷🏻
I love itttt!! 😍🥰
This number is amazing  I love this song❤🎉😊
Yet another Max Martin hit for Pink
Had no idea this was pink, just heard it on the radio
Mein Motto! Soll auf meiner Beerdigung gespielt werden...ist bald soweit
I love you pink you are what every mother and woman should try to be ...who knew
Beautiful music! You helped raise me and I’m proud to say I’m strong and kind and fun 🫶🏼 thanks for sharing more songs!
I love it 💕🔥
shes not my style but her vocals are so impressive. shes so bright shiny n smart. I love her
She resembles my first roommate in so many ways...i Miss her😭
Shes one badass woman! Such a inspiration to all and a wonderful mother. I just love her voice and I could listen to her for hours ♥️
The video is soooo good 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ll be honest. Not a massive fan but this tune is UNREAL. It does something to me; I fooking love it 🔥🔥🔥
Pink is the total package. True talent .
Pink just has to always have songs that give positive energy 🥰🥰🤩💫
❤❤❤. Love this song.
Considerando em eleger essa música como a melhor da Pink!!! Um absurdo de tão boooooa! ❤
I swear Pink wrote this for me! Love it!
This is such a Feel Good Song!!!!
This song is a Golden Trash of the year. Covid really hit us hard with creating music. Who tf speaks “never gonna not”? Pink needs to relearn proper English again. Dumb music
Don’t mind my timestap:        0:15
Some people have spirit animals, I have a spirit human it is you Pink, I hope after the therapy I am being brave enough to do at 49, this will be me dancing  in about 5months time popping for a bit of shopping lol, if I can get my hands on a concert ticket for sunderland to see you, I may bust a few moves
Pink is pink 💕
This is the song I needed to keep going. Pink you are always an inspiration to me. After living through so much trauma. I felt so defeated. I’m getting back up again and becoming a better person after being beaten.
The worst fcking song I’ve ever heard
OMG PINK IS BRILLIANT!!!❤
Best song pink made so far without a doubt
She is a special person.xxxx❤
Always funny makes you happy
When you have all your work partners dancing this song !!!!  What a moment !!!!!
After COVID, hip and neck surgeries.... PINK throws on roller skates and dances through grocery store, awards ceremony and trust falls over a cliff to motivate us! The least we can do is send her hugs and then get up and try to do something, anything positive with our day!
This is an awesome song. Love you so.much
Awesome as usual keep kickin a## and dance again!
Amazing 👌
This album...u literally go from crying to wanting to dance! Every time u think she can't get any better she just keeps getting better & better!
Increíble mujer, qué energía, voz y talento, hermosisima
That's really cute. Why the h* I'm not dancing anymore?
I can't not dance to this pink is my all time favorite singer performer so amazing I named my daughter after her she is amazing
Holy crap so good 🔥
I am a fan!!!
The lyrics drive me crazy, she would give away her dog, but not her dancing shoes? I know it’s just a song, but I just can’t get over that 😒🥺
Sooooooo underrated...
Gute Laune pur !
After being a social worker for decades, I became a misanthrope.  Now in retirement, music, dancing, nature, and animals are the only things that keep me going.  Thank you Pink to speak my heart.
Pink chesback my fe vs er  pink she's good Shep old hip hop on and Rock  😃👍 music
I have so much energy after hearing this amazing song thank you !!! 😊❤
Word......xxx
Leave it to pink to evoke emotion from us. Her music always says" feel someting" ❤️
I'm in love in Pink, what can I say?
Every time my 4 year old daughter hears Pink on the radio she goes nuts and loves her. She did ask if she could roller skate around Tesco 😂 an amazing fearless and talented artist
Another song of God coming 🙏 to get us. . I am sure their is dancing in heaven
Ale drze ryja pizda
over dramatic crap never gonna record something that is listenable i can punch your face in bitch for charity 3 rounds
Pink, I'm 55 years old and you rock my world !! xx
Perfect dance song to live by!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
OMG! I just discovered this song. So energic. Beautiful lyrics. Mood booster. Thanks, P!nk
I didn’t like this song until I listened to the whole album. TRUSTFALL is a beast!!
Pink is the only artist I've seen through the years that keep being true to herself and we all love her for it
Yeah, yeah ,yeah ,🙌🙏🌈🌏😇✊💧🌱
Take my birthday cake, my soul, my dog…….  Hardly even hear the subliminal satanism.   I liked this song too.  Until I listened to all the words.
I REALLY LOVE THIS SONG IT'S GREAT 💯✌️☺️💖 ALSO GREAT VIDEO 🌟 Ms.COBY🦂✡️🇳🇱🌟
Girl that song is live WOW make me get up and dance and never stop can't wait see what next with you see at CMA awards
Somebody compared this to 'Can't Stop the Feeling' by Justin Timberlake. Do they know that Max Martin is behind both songs?
PERFECT !!
Why does this song have an ending!!!😩😩😩
Love this one
Pink умничка!
noo this is  the best
Cute video Pink is so…tiny lol
I wanna dance to this so bad but lupus is desroying my hips and it hurts... but i WILL SING
Thanks to our dj’s on the radio here in the Netherlands i hear this fucking annoying song every day 100 times and i cant get it out of my head!!! Most fucking annoying song ever!!!!
Thanks P!nk for writing me the perfect 60th Birthday song 4/1.  I love to sing and dance 🎉
What Ugly and annoyed song
My new favorite happy song!!! 💖
Oh i absolutly love the Asian boy
PINK - you absolutely are a rock star. One of my favorite artist. You keep on singing and creating beautiful lyrics. Go girl. Love ya!
Love the MV
It sounds just like all her other songs ... :/
masterpiece
I feel like this video is missing one thing: Danny Sexbang 😂
Zalig .💖🌞☘️
I love pink
This is not just any song - I am saving myself by dancing, alone, in my living room.  This song is made for me.  I love you PINK.
whats funny, i threw myself on floor right next to my daughter and she got up and looked embarrassed, she never did it again!
I love this song ❤
Goodness this concert will be my 1st ever missed concert since ive been a teen ( almost 40)...... And goodness im utterly gutted...... :(....   Willing ta sell one of my kids for a ticket ;) JKS..... Whoever is going it will be epic.....  Like a fine wine .... Just gets better... Never dissapoints.
We need more strong women like Pink in the world!!!
Am I the only one who noticed the pride flags are upside down onn the counter?
Pink, your music has been in many of my life situations, always bringing light ro it and strength to my soul. Thanks
SUPER !!!🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
Female Version of CR7 xD
Je n'accroche pas du tout rien à faire 🤬. Une déception.
MY TEACHER ALWAYS PLAYS THIS SONG
If you all get a chance watching the Making of this video, it looked like it was so much fun to make!
My favourite song
good song
i love this song so much!! just perfect for our weekly cozy jam sessions with the local fishermen 🥰 muchas gracias thank you!! ❤️
How can anyone say they like this??? Its trash!
This song is a very algorithmic, catchy song and pink definitely knows how to do that very well...as do a lot of musicians these days. I don't think that it's cool for her lyrics to say "take off all of my clothes", especially considering the song is being marketed as a family-friendly song. I just think it's a slippery slope because predators could say "Hey listen to this song, whenever we're happy we dance and we take off all of our clothes!"....I just don't like the connotation, and having been through things like this in my experience it would be easy for a predator to use this song in that way.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY QUEENNNNN
Thank you so much for representing so many bodies, ages and colors in this video. just beautiful. dance is for EVERYONE!
What lovely powerful feminine voice WAW
Needed this song in my life ❤️
You dance, beautiful girl :)  You helped me through horrible things and horrible times.  I'm an AC/DC, Guns and Roses, Iron Maiden, and Metallica kind of guy, but you have had and always will have a place with them, and maybe above them, in my heart :)  I love what you do!  Keep doing it, lady ;)  Love ya!
I love this song 😭😭❤️❤️
One of her best Songs. Already in Love ❤ lovely songwriting!
Ugh. Pink is supernatural. So amazing❤
Such a fun song!
Danke P¡NK thank you ...ich bin aufgewacht. Ich stehe wieder auf. Nichts wird mich umhauen , niemand wird mich jemals wieder klein machen ,mir meine Würde nehmen, dem Spaß am Leben.ich kann nicht zurück aber neu anfangen.ich entscheide mich für mein Glück. Danke für dieses Lied für deine Musik
good vibes!
I wanted to like this song, but it's too "busy" with the double-negative.
Durch dieses Lied vergesse ich kurzfristig unsere gebrochene Welt und muss die ganze Zeit lachen... Danke Pink
Can anyone help me find the tank top she has on when she's dancing outside!? I want it so bad.
Sending love from jamaica we play your songs everyday. You're a legend
I'm having the worst psychotic break of my life. So I will stop now to listen to Pink. And bought lots of pretty stuff. And going to a spa and getting off this mobile phone x
Max Martin the King...
I wish they'd had the "dance" backup vocals line in the background on every beat 2 like in I Wanna Dance With Somebody at the end. Either the originals or a replica
i just heard the song for the first time on the radio in cape town all the way in south africa...... I LOOOOVVVVVEEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Banger right here
Might as well.🤷  🪩💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽🎶💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽🎶
Not just she is a great performer, but she is so down to earth, she is so humble too
👍
i was hit by a drunk driver in December, im a stripper and a performer, my R ankle was potentially done...its March and i can move better than before, ANTHEM!
In 20 years this song is still going to be the best 🎉
J'adore 🎵🎧🎶🌏❤️❤️😍😍
I love it pink
Bella canción!!
Beautiful classic
🥰🤩
hot dog buns
Sorry taught!

Love how fit and athletic Pink is
I can not wait to see her in August! I am PINK in my mind, haha! I hope to see other people there!
Love this song
Never gonna LAP DAAAAANCE again!!!
💖💖💖
I seriously expected cameos from Walk The Moon and Justin Timberlake.
42 years old and I dance like a chicken but when this song comes on I dance and don’t give a f**k who sees it lmao
Pink is beyond AMAZING!!!
Pink got me smiling from ear to ear watching this music video. I've been a fan since day 1 and I just love her music I have about 3 or 4 of her CDs can't wait to get this one. I love seeing her dance, great to see her doing that again.
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️🫶💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
It's too bad she told half her fanbase to fuck off if they didnt agree with her views. So much for tolerance and uplifting everyone
reminds me of a bad 80`s song.....
All pinks make me happy
My youngest daughter just told me that this song IS sooooo me! I was a former dance teacher, I just celebrated my 60th birthday by clubbing. This song just brought me to tears!  Thank you Pink!
I really want to go to one of your concerts but I can’t afford tickets for my family ❤
This song 😢❤makes me miss my happiest times
P!NK is just good for the soul.
Exelente👌
Horrible
Fancy teaching me how to dance? X
I love this song since l was 7 👍❤
Where are pinks jeans from xx
This is my dance song
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !!! THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH ! -NANA
👍
this is her weakest lead single ever... what happened here?
She is amazing! Seeing her Live on her Beautiful Trauma Tour I was brought to tears of joy. Her music validates and makes me feel spoken for. This song brought back those beautiful joyful tears. Life is short. ALWAYS DANCE! Trustfall as an album is amazing!!!
Before I watched this I imagined her dancing in the rain
Pink wow so different from what we’ve been hearing from her. I love ❤️ it. It’s cheerful fun and full of energy. I feel like she’s doing something fun for her kids. Like a message ( I can stop or give up something but I won’t give up what I love ) something like that. I think pink looks beautiful she’s always toned and in great shape with awesome dance moves. Great song. Love Pink💕
Love it make me happy 😊 😃
What an underated artist and singer, she's sounded the same for the past 20 years,great songwriter, I absolutely love this woman, Alicia Moore🥰my favourite artist ever,2nd to mariah carey ❤❤love you pink, what an underated singer, ger voice is ridiculous,
PINK👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️😍👍
I am a 60 plus grandma who just started dancing again because of Pink's song! And my 8 and 4 year old granddaughter's dance with me! I freaking love this song!
This song is all i need
💛💜👏💙😍
Every time I hear this song I cry man
A really great song although first time I heard it I thought it was from Katy Perry. I listend to it now a couple of times and I still believe it has some KP vibe. But in the end who cares. This is great music and (by far) better than a lot of the other releases of so called „artists“ coming out of the Instagram copy machine.
Why is pinks song always involve aggression of some sort I wish she’d tone it down at least sometimes. Power is great but sometimes it wears thin. It’s ok to be gentle too rather than hard as nails all the time
Pink hit another one outta tha park. Love it! Just like Ferrell with his Happy! This one takes you outta your blues.
I love Pink so much!!
Ame si video y la canción es genial, me encanta
Every so often I thought maybe I was watching a JoJo Siwa video.
🎉❤
Perfect and excellent music and nice video 💎💯💎💯🌹✌️
I love this song 💗💜💞💛💚it brings Hope and Joy. Yes it's ok to be  your crazy  happy self and be positive and spread the Happy Vibes in this 🌎 💫🌈🌈🌈🌈
This music is so good i love it
Implying bikers are boozers, big yikes
Leave it to Pink! Brought me right back to a better place!❤
Im so sorry pink u are a rock star to me and still my favo singer and my hero but it also. Got me a little sad i used to dance before cuz i was a cheerleader back in the old days. I was 11 in 2000 year its been awhile after since i love dancing so. Much because i can call it my home to be free to be who i wanted now. My dream is to become a professional cheerleader or a professional dancer too.
Patologia
Fing  bad
Thank you Pink❤️❤️
The Whitney reference hit for me!! Dancing around the living room as a small child, MTV on & "I Wanna Dance With Somebody" blaring from the tube was just something I love reliving, even doing the same with my daughters (sans MTV though & replace w/ the phone)
Why does this song make me cry real ugly tears every time I hear it?   If dancing is in your soul and you’ve ever been in a sunken place where you stop then you get it. Dance gives me life.   Thank you Pink. 💖
Absolutely love this song!!!!! it is exactly what I’ve been going through for years. My ex-husband said I should not dance in front of people. Love you pink.!!!!!
Damn this is a banger Pink a fun song you skating & grooving & has that MJ feel I love it & puts me in a good mood 💯🎼🎤❤️😆✌️
You should have Avery Dixon from America's Got Talent to play that sax part! He's 20yrs old, in the finals, winner announces Tuesday. That would be a dream for him! He's awesome....almost as much as you!
너무좋아요 핑크
Surreal video since I actually shop at that grocery store sometimes. Now I'm going to be wandering through there thinking about the llama that was once cruising the aisles.
Pink Sings as Katy Perry . Do we really need a second katy Perry?🙄
🥰🥰
j adore 🥰
j adore 🥰
My favorite all time artist ❤️😍!!
Bgs lagu dan suaranya
This song brings tears of joy to my eyes!😹😂💖
She dances like a black gyal
Never gonna not is a double negative
Bring. On. Pink coming. March  2024
Pink is such an incredible artist , loveee her no BS attitude and if you know her you know is not a gimmick, she is the real deal
Unique for a reason 👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really think Pink and Monsta X would be a perfect collab mix.
Yea, that ..dancing good rhythm
💗💗💗♥️♥️♥️💜💜💜💖💖💖⭐⭐⭐
So all I see is that she saw the comments about we liked rnb pink days and thought hmmm let me put that COSTUME on again and start street dancing again. But no black people in the video til the very end where u can hardly see them. Yh I peeped that.
Great song ! Super light, funky and make you wanna dance so much, thank you Pink I’m sure you make so many hearts smile with this one ❤
So good to here this
Pink brings so much happiness to my heart, I love her so much because she’s a People’s person.😊
Take my dog? 🐶 Fcuk no!
A fun and Happy song. I love the sentiment.
No reconocía a la bella Pink....si aceptas una opinión sin maldad,no te favorece nada ese look

I wish i could dance with you at least one time💗 to be a dancer in your tour would be a dream 💫 your voice and energy is so powerful. I can’t imagine being right there in the mix of it all 💃
This song is a Grammy Award Winning song.  I'm calling it. #Grammyawards it would have been a blast to be on this video shoot as an extra. 😆
2:29: She literally just ran to the store with random people following her
Pink has been my most favorite artist since the 90s. She's true to herself in her music and life.
You are such an inspiration for my 10 yr old daughter… she said imagine if I could play with Willow Heart on the beach at the golf coast .. the excitement was unbelievable & indescribable!!  Thank you for sharing your strength 💗🤘🏽✌🏽
Great!.....Pink Greetings from Germany -Back-Forrest
I know their all dancer's but it looks like a group of people who ya see In your local area n just has a fucking party 🎉 yup pink love this... nothing stops music 🎶 just keeps getting  better every time  ♥ 🇮🇪  xxx x
Despite being a long term fan, I've just realised that this song has single-handedly caused me to drop a LARGE bundle on tickets to a live show. Over a week's pay and I'm not even mad! I've loved the vibe from very early on, but this song just gives me the "feels"!  Can not wait!
D-d-dance Dance 🎶🕺💃👯🩰🔥
Thanks for sharing ❤️
I bought ur new album today
💞💞💞💞💙
1:37 ICE SPICE?!?!
Great song! ❤
I'm not sure.  I am a fan of her early pink and accepted the rock pink but I'm not a convert to this.  It is nice to see her back but I'm not converting, yet.  Her RnB flavour was unmatchable back in the day.  To automatic responders this is not hate just honesty go back to your ignoring your laundry and electricity bills.
Oh and I pre-ordered your album as well 👌😍💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
You are  so amazing! I Love your Songs and your so beautiful voice!!

"Never Gonna Not Dance Again" Lyrics  If someone told me that the world would end tonight You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight (Yeah, right) You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love  But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records Take off all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) Da da da dance da dance, I'm gonna dance, bruh Da da da dance da dance, I'm gonna dance  I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance) I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun  'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancing shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die (I'll lay down and die) I'll scream and I'll cry (I'll scream and I'll cry) You know that I'm starting a fight  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records Take off all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) Da da da dance da dance, I'm gonna dance, bruh Da da da dance da dance, I'm gonna dance  Da da da dance da dance, I'm gonna dance, yeah Da da da dance da dance  I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry You know that I'm starting a fight (Fight) I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records Take off all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (hey, hey)  I'm never gonna not dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again So let the music play 'til the end Dance again Never gonna not dance again Dance again (So let the music play 'til the end) Let it play yeah  Dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again (So let the music play 'til the end) Come on, come on  (I'm never gonna not gonna dance again) (So let the music play 'til the end) Yeah, yeah I'm never gonna not gonna dance again So let the music play 'til the end  Thank you! 💞 Source: https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pink/nevergonnanotdanceagain.html
Is this video taped at El Rancho in Santa Ynez? I believe so, sure looks like it. Great store! Sister store in Pismo.
I thought..."good for you, you're not gonna lap dance again" Now i know i heard completely wrong!
You are one of a kind! You are light to this society!
love how everyone drops their addiction at the end: Meat, cigarettes, alcohol, sweets... 💪♥️
This is the song I needed that I never knew I needed. She is my idol.
Your going to stop dancing say's Daniel.
How tf did I miss this!? Loved,liked, shared, cherished.. repeated. 🥰
This the type of music we need back in 2023!
Thanks for sharing such good vibes with us! This is so good! ❤️🫶🏼
Hey babe, thanks for putting our flags in your shopping cart. 💕
Music is one of the most powerful things 9n this earth.  It reaches down into ours souls to the core of our being to find a place that resonates with us. P!NK does this with her music every single time.  There is no shame in her story. She shares her brightest...and darkest....moments with the world. And makes no apologies for it. Absolutely amazing soul that will always be times and relevant. Keep being amazing
Awful and this song doesn't suit her AT ALL.
Lord don't try me? Be careful what you ask for. You may find yourself dancing in flames. Just so you know your best song was "There you go". But the hook is cool on this one....about it tho.
I thought Justin timberlake can't stop the feeling than I saw song credits max Martin but I think thisis a good track  something up beat for once and it does want to make you dance
Love this song!!! Thank You P!nk 😘
P!nk ist sehr gut! Ich liebe du!!!!
Try Just like fire Good One

Pink New Album 2023

Saw her in concert!!! Amazing performer!😊
Mega cool 😎 🎊 😂
Toby Mac
love u ms pink
Seriously  brilliant  singing from Pink and marvellous  videoxx
I had an ex that hated whenever I danced and told me I wasn’t allowed to dance. Now my husband, the man I choose to marry loves watching me dance around because he has said I wouldn’t be doing it unless I wasn’t happy. So this song reminds me of the two differences between a control freak and a good man.
This one and Flowers! I Love it! Both ❤ P!NK is everything and always Perfect. I Love her
Love pink the only one person that doesn't give  a f**k about what anyone thinks about her definitely my inspiration all the way she made me realise like is not always what it seems just full of haters well fuck the haters I say and so would she
Same shit ! Different shovel! Boring
P!nk still lookin 😍😍
That stolen DNA those scientist experiments  That's all mine 😂  See you later  Alligator
And it's REBECCA MOORE NOT PINK YOU
And when I'm done here   Your gonna Jewish you never partook in my KARAOKE FESTIVAL

You are the realist white girl I ever heard!! My god!!!
I always love you pink with all my heart!!!
Not only are the notes of this song so painful to the ears, the lyrics just make it beyond acceptable to even be able to stand hearing this to the end👎👎👎
Me and my mum love you

So good

From the skate world.. thank you

White woman anthem
Pink proves how to have fun at supermarkets
The only sad thing is. THIS SONG ENDS 🎉
that kid is so cute  thanks for the amazing music Pink
Very Underrated, this should be in the top 10 most viewed music videos.
pink is fucking back yes!!!!!
Up there with WHITNEY Baby.....
Queen.
I'm glad to see P!NK finally getting the recognition she deserves. Since the beginning, I've always said that she was a better singer than Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. She just never received her credit because she decided not to conform to the silly early 2000s pop singer mold. She always did it her way.
Most trash song. Laziest lyrics. Absolutely waste of time filler music & will be forgotten within minutes like the rest of this old lady’s catalogue from the last 10 years. If you are offended I want to congratulate you for having a terrible taste in music
Oh, my! Never gonna stop watch your videos again!! Love it! Keep it going, lady!! 👍💪
Oh P!nk how I LOVE YOU MUSIC. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shes still releasing great Songs after >20 years ♥️
Had pinks song as my wedding song just give me a reason xxxx
Omg Noooo!!! D-D-D-D-D-Dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-D-D-D-D-Dance I'm gonna dance D-D-D-D-D-Dance I'm gonna dance, yeah D-D-D-D-D-Dance
If someone told me that the world would end tonight You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love  But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance) I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun  'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancing shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry Know that I'm starting a fight  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, yeah, d-d-d-dance  I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry You know that I'm starting a fight (Fight) I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (hey, hey)  Never gonna not dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again Let the music play 'til the end Dance again Never gonna not dance again Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Let it play yeah Dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Come on, come on (I'm never gonna not gonna dance again) (So let the music play 'til the end) Yeah, yeah I'm never gonna not gonna dance again So let the music play 'til the end
Why are you selling your soul to the pharma. Don't you know the side effects and people who are no longer alive. There are too many, am very disappointed in you. You can't be so horny for money.
Never not dancing killed a bunch of people in Strasbourg in 1518

Am I the only one searching for this song under "dancing shoes"? Yes. Ok.....
Wat a beautiful song and
That is a great video and song
THE KID IN THE AILES
Love this song alot❤️❤️❤️
Shame she sold her soul to Pfizer.
Video ist wirklich top ! Aber leider singtechnisch ist noch sehr viel Luft nach oben . Bin es anders gewohnt von ihr
bad song is bad
I love your consistency, you always do a good music. You understand the assignment ❤️, im your big fan. Shout out from RSA 🇿🇦
Totally infectious sound. Well done, Pink. Well done.
23 years or more making great hits one after another, congratulations P!NK, Don't stop the music
Thanks Pink for your song. I dance everyday with it and I feel so fine. It's my energy spoon.
https://youtu.be/zDBSIGITdY4
Love thisssssssssssss !!!!! Pink you’re awesome
I LOVE Pink…ever since her first album. Always a fan.❤

Thank you Pink
Welcome back Queen P!nk❤️
Não há razões para essa música não ter sido um mega hit
May you be encouraged with beauty and Joy!! Sing Pink you are so beautiful!
Pink always gets better and better no matter what song no matter what style she gets us she gets all of this way that we and that's why we love her ❤️❤️😘😘💓💓💓🙀🙀🙀💯💯💯‼️‼️‼️
TRUSTFALL | Feb 17 | Pre-order and pre-save my new album now 💜  https://pink.lnk.to/TRUSTFALL
I LOVE so much this woman! Her energy and songs is like a boost for life…  Live P!nk Life
This song makes me so happy when I'm sad! Love it!
Pink was Not Mine until this single.a good dancetrack.
Do I hear the same sound from Can’t Stop the Feeling! by Justin Timberlake? I love 💕 the both songs.
That choir feeling at the end..."I am never gonna not dance again, so let the muziq play till the end" ☺☺. Love it.
stupid video
❤
This song tops my cardio playlist.❤️
P!nk is in a class by herself and she gets a A+ for everything she does!! She can do no wrong! Everything about her is GOLD (or P!nk lol😂). LOVE LOVE LOVE everything about her! ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤ Love it!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🍀🌈
Love this song. Such a feel good song. Makes me smile. And love the video.
I'm leaving now
this should be dedicated to all the injured and killed people that died in Monteray park Cali
Going to the grocery store has never been this much fun! P!NK knows how to throw a party!
Great song, but ffs every damn video these days  has to be lgbtq wokeness  propaganda bs. 👎
Love the music
amazing
My absolute favorite happy song
Pink is back !!!needed this thank you
Absolutely best song ever. 🎉
Свет выключили потому что воздушная тревога?
If you like songs and videos celebrating dancing, don't miss Trainor's "Better When I'm Dancing." IT IS WONDERFUL!!!!!!
Video resolution is terrible for some reason -- but it's P!nk so....no matter. Love this song but my favorite in-store video is Bareilles' "Gonna Get Over You" (one of her best songs too IMO)....Any video with roller skating in it is good by me, and she's wearing QUADS not blades. For many of us, this song is the theme of life. We are never NOT dancing -- crosswalks, libraries, hiking trails, bowling lanes, hospital hallways ... Alecia has never forsworn her gymnast roots, and we are the lucky witnesses! Dancing is life!
Somebody here can tell me which cookie the boy is eating in the beginning of this vídeo??? Never saw that here in Portugal and looks soooo delicious!!!!! 😋😋😋
P!nk... If you have 11 milion views... why is it than that there is NOBODY DANCING in the supermarkets? I was the only dancing creature in all supermarkets where I was around the world the last few years.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
She'd get rid of her dog over shoes? Geez. That's pretty cold
a true superwoman <3
Am I the only one who thinks that all or if not most artists and bands from the late 90s to the early 2000s don't hear much about today? But yet pink for over 2 decade's still comes back time after creating brilliant track's.  Now another fantastic tune from pink. Undoubtedly one of the best artist ever!
Me encanta esta canción y me recuerda muchísimo a Abba, no se por qué. Estaría genial una versión con los miembros de Abba.
Okay Pink coming with these bangers this is what I want to be hearing. I've been giving up on music nowadays, I'll be getting back into Pinks music again
I thought this is our story.I wanna have some fun,I don't wanna suffer,I wanna enjoy my life., This is our story.I think this thoughts are felt everyone. I don't wanna lose my life.I felt.
https://youtu.be/zDBSIGITdY4
I always love her songs and I will always love till the end of life and the world right.
very positive song, it disperses bad mood and makes u really wanna dance 😊
This woman is so amazing and just keeps bringing us perfection!
This is really not one of her best song! I don’t like it!
Strong massages I all.of her songs she  looked good and has strong sense of wrigth and wrong it only a fuck you hold my baby attributes  when see wrong  in the world .
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ilysm!!

Thanks Pink for this positive and energetic Song  Merci from France 🙏🙏🙏🌞🌙🌍🌟🎶🌄
great to see that you, much like the rest of us, refuse to grow old graciously :) you are an inspiration!! :)
this song is so overplayed on the radio lmao it drives me insane when i’m in work (came here just to hate sorry❤️)
P!NK I ❤️ U!
Thank you pink ,graciaaas por este temazo , te levanta el ánimo y no paras de cantar y bailar !! A tod@s sonreíd y dance !!
Needed this song to remind me to be joyful!
Why is the video format so stretched ?
They can play this at my funeral.
Love! Love! Love!
A bad  verion de Justin Timberlake    can't stop the feeling
P!nk you have my uttermost gratitude. For this is precisely the melody I deeply require in my life.
In dieser Woche ist eine sehr tolle Person in unserer Familie verstorben. Sie wünscht sich, bunte Kleidung auf ihrer Beerdigung. Sie möchte keine Blumen oder Kränze. Sie wünscht sich, dass wir lachen und nicht weinen. Genau diesen Spirit hat dieses Lied für mich und es macht mich sehr emotional. Einfach tolles Lied. Genau zur richtigen Zeit 💜✨
So Much Fun !!! is there nothing that you can't do Pink !!
cringe
❤️
Iconic 💕
She is still a complete fucking bad ass and I love her for it and I love that about her!
Don't lay down those dancing shoes!!!!

Hyv verpo cam, ustra lung cavt unu cafa cafs buts unemat tovs stab bulug tarb ong temro ots....
oh it’s “not” not “lap”
So sad the whole abortion issues :(  Her music was so important to all people no matter their political views   Kinda sucks because her music can be so positive and lovely   But I hope for those that still continue to listen to her  That her music still helps you feel happy and good :)   We shouldn’t be divided   We are all human no matter our opinions  Or ways to live   But she stands up for what she thinks is right and that’s fine   Other people can as well in their own way ^^   Regardless I love her music and appreciate the kind messages in a lot of them
Taking boys and 1 daughter to a wrestling tourney this weekend. Played you're music and they 💘 it!
I love this song, she is so beautiful and talented
You, no one are taking my fucking dog! Know this
She’s definitely a princess loving her best life✨💟
P!nk on the floor like that kid lol
Good with this ideas... smile

I can’t stand Pink bur godammit she writes a catchy tune
Wohooo...luv this amazing lady .SLAYYY💥💥💥💥🥰
She is just so easy to listen to her music just soothes my soul
Really a Pfizer ad...working with big pharma! What a loser!
ApPal Sweet
P hold it down you'll like it
P1nk is so f*cking cringe lmao. Literal seniors listen to her stuff nowadays
Idk why but this song made me feel happy 😁
I think you know that I feel gratitude for all you do together. The best part of the video is the electricity in off.
If given a chance to sit it  out or dance it out, DANCE baby!!!

Instant Happiness 😃when I hear this, makes me wanne sing and dance in the street and on the job.
I really  want her to do one more soulful and rnb album 😩
This song and the one with your daughter make me think of my mom. She died from cancer in 2019 and I like to think she’s having fun still.
what a happy song
Bet l,a still kicks himself for ever telling her to change all she is she never did and how successful has she been gotta love her
This lady is so incredible. I wanted to buy tickets for my sister, but the terrible TicketMaster monopoly makes it so that I cannot :( I hope that TicketMaster is dismantled so that regular people can see concerts again without this bullshit.
honestly pink says exactly whats needed and does whats life
WOW, The VIDEO got me dancing like crazy while cooking dinner. I first heard this today in the car and I had to TURN IT UP because, I was falling asleep and I had a long way to drive home. This SONG may have saved mine and someone's lives. THANK YOU, PINK!!!!
Pink looking like her first album.
this sounds so much like party started!
such a bop!

P!nk is the definition of cool. She seems to manage to be both tough and sensitive, athletic but unique, and is inclusive AF. She reminds me of that friend you take to the shady dive bar. You know you’re gonna have a good time but she has your back if the shit goes down. I’ve really enjoyed watching her career. She never fails to bring it.
Iove this song ❤️
J'adore
😍
I need this so bad. I just got kicked out of my internship because people didn't like that I was so quiet but this helped me realize again that I'm perfect the way I am and to keep moving forward 🤍
I love this so much!

This song chear me up. Been sick for 7 month and lost my most loved dog 6 weeks ago.
This woman lifts people up so effortlessly. Thank you P!nk for always coming through. You have no idea what you mean to so many people. ❤
I love how I am hearing this all over the radio. What a nice way to lift everyone's spirits up when they hear this hit!
##########
At least not until your Pfizer vaxx causes your heart to stop...
Can't wait to see ya this Summer...🥳🥳🥳🥳🤗🤗🤗
It reminds me a lot of Justin Timberlake's "Can't stop the feeling" but it's P!nk so it's ten times better.
The Germanys Next Topmodel 2023 opening song :)
i hate this song
Wow i didnt even know this was pinks song until today,,,good for you girl,,love u
This song reminds me a lot of Sara Bareilles!!
I would love to hear this song sung by Michael Jackson.
Greatness is yours 😍💖😂👏🌹🎉✨💯😇💯🎉✨
love love pink🥰😍😘
Wer ist hier wegen GNTM 2023?
Amazing, i adore Pink.
This song has a chokehold on me baaaaad it makes me cry happy tears and dance my ass off cos you can take everything from me but you’ll never take my kids and my music
I was liking the song up until the part of taking away the dog. The pups are their till the end.
I hear this song daily at work, before I found myself imagining a basic brunette girl with a middle part singing- I get she’s old but when she get basic?
Ich hätte es fast nicht erkannt da es ja mal richtig anders klingt...... Nicht.... Immer die selbe Leier, es klingt immer genauso.... Zum Kotzen!
Her songs would be so much better without the f bombs. And if she would wear something to cover her butt.
Ok song played to death at the mo .see ain’t American the dog liric does my head kin nightmare.
All of pinks songs are great but loving this hype and happy side of her again
has to be one of the worst songs to ever exist
Yup. This Song/Video Made Everyones Day. Sure Of It. 🌋🎀
10M
What a legend.  Pre ordered my cd. ❤️❤️❤️
I maybe 50 years old but I will never Not dance again!  I absolutely love this video!  I can't wait to be front and center at one of your concerts again.  Best concert experience and performance in my life.  Thank you Pink for just being you.  You inspire us all young and old!
Anyone else dying to know where her black bodysuit is from 😍
love your every being. Such a true person, to yourself and family and to us. Your songs are amazing , the way they  lift my spirits!  Now where are my roller skates, ah yes my car, ready for the next skating adventure!
One of my favorits Songs! Want to See here in Vienna! Kind regards and many hugs! Mario
I expected to see Nikocado on a scooter
Soulless, generic and sounds like some corporate garbage song that gets overplayed on the radio. Almost as bad as that Meghan Trainor song. Awful.
such a good vibe song i love hearing this 17 times a day on the radio it really gives me happiness and joy
I love pink but the black community played a big part in the rise of her career kinda hurts to see that abandoned 😢
P!nk is one of my favorite artists of all time, her music never fails to light me up! ❤
Brought to you by Pfizer 🤮
このあみタイツ履けばくいこみすぎるなりる→
arigato ❤  Gave me pppppowerrrr!! Again & again   no para
Boring song - as boring as all her other songs from the last years.
Thank you, Pink, for such lovely and postive vibes <3
This song truly speaks to my soul!! Makes me cry happy tears as I dance around my kitchen!! Just reminds me so much of my late Momma! She passed away Valentine's Day 5 years ago this year! She loved you and would have loved this song! 💛 You are truly an amazing woman! And absolutely gorgeous!
She was , is and always be the most beautiful pop singer 😍
I absolutely love pink and this song is amazing and will be played for decades to come. I'm sorry to say I don't like the video.  WHen I heard it I imagined pink dancing all different dances tap ballet ballroom and street  with backing dancers would have been awesome 👌 Not a supermarket.
It's better than she is wearing jeans. Then the ugly tatoo is not visible on her foot. 🙂
So cool pink!  Love the skater shoes!
Excellent !!!! 🎶🎧 Clip !!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Your such an inspiration pink 💗 💓
https://youtu.be/qnnlT5AIJO8
Hooooorrible song. It feels like everything P!nk releases is the most generic, cheap music to exist. You can make pop music that's still interesting and unique but she insists on being the female Maroon 5.
https://youtu.be/_Ume-twsUx0
i so wait wat so ever new im hope very soon release new but still perfect great song pink you perfect preformance
Best midlife crisis song 👌🏽
Aguante pink !! Saludos desde argentina ! Tendré que ir a verte a otro país , si dios quiere !! Sos genial pink !
WAHOU....   Du groove, très dansant, çà fout la pêche !!   le refrain est top top
cooooooool
😍😍😍
Justin Timberlake Can't stop the feeling.... Poor copy. Sorry
Oh my she hit all totally awesome as usual bless her 🙏💕😊💜👍
Oh Pink! Thanks so much for this song. It’s just what I needed!
Absolutely love this!
Miluju její styl! Je pořád sexy a ten hlas. 😍👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I love This Song  Makes Me Fill Like Dancing Thanks Pink!
*I'm Never Gonna Not Dance Again* cause *I Wanna Dance With Somebody Who Loves Me* ❣ 1:15 I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song. NGNDA gives me IWDWS vibes. Two of the best Pop/Dance songs ever!  Nice shout out from one great singer to the Greatest Of All Times Miss Whitney Elizabeth Houston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH3giaIzONA  💛💚❤Gotta love the the fun flashy 80's colors!💙💗💜  Pink sure does!😝
Pink Lady 😇
Heureusement il y a Pink !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the energy, lyrics and sentiments. Think it maybe my theme song when I head for my 70s.
GOOD SONG, TOO BAD WASNT SUCCESFULL
I will meet you one day! 💗 I’m such a huge fan
We played this at the March for Life yesterday. Always great to warm up and loosen up to!
😎😎😎😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😍
This song had such good vibes to it and I love it! The vocals at the end are by far my favorite!🤩
Love this song
Vaccine anyone . Imagine the money she made promoting it paid for this .. Wef puppet
She looks like a drag queen
Great song! Every one of your songs are hits! Always loved your music...
The jeans and top are giving everything anything has ever given holy crap babes!!!!
Ler's dance!. Life is beautiful!🤍👏👏👏👏
日本人ーー？？🙋‍♀️

Hell yeah. I just want to roller dance with P!nk. Love this tune 🙌
SIIIICK!
I am really batteling my mental health right now. This song has been an anchor for me. Thank you so much 💞
❤ This song is my Spirit Animal. ❤
I love pink,she is best of all, great song  and great music 🎶.
Ich danke dir Pink :) mein Frau hat mich verlassen und seit 3 Monaten das erste Mal das ich gute Laune habe dank diesem super Lied von dir :)
Way a horible artist al sounds the same she screams more than she sings just commercial corparate junk terrible
How about the fact she is sponsored by Pfizer now and turned off comments on her post? WTF Pink? You were the people's person and weve been betrayed. Remember your lyrics..... "We are searchlights, we can see in the dark We are rockets, pointed up at the stars We are billions of beautiful hearts And you sold us down the river too far   Yeah-we have seen through the dark, what they have been trying to force feed us. That's what Pfizer, our government and now you have done....sold us down the river. Have supported you my whole life and am so disappointed like the rest of your fans. Was planning on seeeing you on this tour and now- NOPE!
👍😘
Wow, different people's perspectives on this song. Gosh pink, you are an amazing artist!!!!. This song for me gives me such happy vibes.
Her songs are so much fun to listen to.
"Dance" in this song can be anything in every person, it is something you really like in ur life and you going to fight for it. This song make me realize I got many things to be cheer for..
Crap.
Canadian Virgin Radio
Very good from PINK I love it.👍👌
Never not is a double negative
fire
My favourite song ever I love you p!NK my idol forever 🥰💕

Amazing video and song 🔥🔥👏👏👏
Visiting our queen again before this blows up!
i love it 🦄🤸💖
This is such a good song for post-pandemic era!!
She's so good!  Love this song!
Type "Joy" into the Google machine and this song will always come up first!
Moriré sin ver a pink en México ? .Dios no permitas que eso pase..necesito esto en mi vida 😭
Never take anyones advice. This video is highly made but doesnt reflect the complexity of the message in the song. ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘
Knaller Song, Knaller Video ❤
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
She's on ROLLER SKATEs...Just when I thought I couldn't love this woman more...#PinkFan4Life 😍
On repeat for a bit...xxx
She sold her soul to Pfizer, and for dancing. The devil love this deal!
love this song
Joy at its purest!♥️
Super
Da hat sie Mal wieder einen Knaller Song. Super
Pink comes out of no where and realase a hit. This is already playing in rotation on the radio in the USA
Maravilhosa
Bonjour 😍😍😍😍😍😍😠😠😠😠😱😓😓😓😓😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song reminds me of an old colleague of mine, he was a stunning guy and a good friend
I love Indie Rock genre, but Pink.. always got my attention to listen, she is amazing!
Beautiful
I have mental problems and depression, I don't see the point in life and it scares me, but this song gives me joy ❤
Amazing, nothing less!
Leuke song 😀
Too bad she bought into the bullshit and sold out to the pfizer and there kool aid
I just love her❤️❤️
This vid is "Can't stop the feeling" with LGBTXYZ people.
why is Pink so amazing? Send both from heaven a f hell? Love
The fave song of 2023
Did the writer of six the musical write this or did they buy the rift? it's soo good
PINK! AI LOVE YOU
Klasse👌👍❤️🥰💃🕺👏👏👏👏👏👏
Just my view, but this is without question the best dance choreography I have ever seen in any music video (ever). Whoever did it should be up for an award.  And of course P!nk is sexy as hell in the video!
That song has got about  80% of old smash hits (from 2007, 2008 music)
Love this on so many levels!!
Yassss!!!
This is uh...... not it.....
very nice
You literally uplifted my soul Pink
Master
Love pink so vibrant 😍
I discovered pink in the late 90s . She was an rnb singer . I was already a fan of her and kept being a fan even when she changed her music style. I'm happy to see her in this style. She is an amazing dancer
I feel like I’ve heard this somewhere before
Only dance I have done in my entire life is the nutbush, and I don't plan to dance again lol... though, i got the feeling of conscription and involvement all at the same time.
Mega gut Außer dem Fleischeinsatz😕!! Sorry!
Gute Laune!
This is my 2023 anthem. I am so excited to see her for the 3rd time in August!
Loving it
I'm just sad I missed the filming of this video. It looks like such a blast. Round #2 @Pink?
Such a great song to listen to when you're feeling down
This incredible song/video is my go-to song at the moment, after losing my husband to cancer last week.  Carlos(56)and I(66) had good run for nearly 26 years and he was(and is) the love of my life, but cancer took him and now I'm faced with starting over and this song always provides me the boost I need to start that recovery.   Like my husband, Pink, you are SO FUCKING AWESOME!!!  I Love You, Pink and I Love You, Carlos.  RIP, my love.
This song gives me shivers! So amazing!!!!
Great Vibes. Time for Summer 🎉
this song is such a vibe!!
I lost my boyfriend and this music is so amazing for list. Thanks Pink love u🫠❤️🥰
great sound, great video, great pink!
great perfect song for me thanks a lot for everything
This. THIS big dick energy. This joy power. YES! Im so here for this: like in my SOUL like🥰🥰🥰
NEVER GONNA NOT DANCE AGAIN💃🏽🥳😮❤️
It's an ok video.   She's done so much better.   I do appreciate the roller skating.    That's all I did when I was younger.   ❤️💞💕💓
Not enough credit. Dude here. Love her. Best music around. True.
LED lights.
Nice to hear her return to singing songs that are fun and not so somber. Keep it up, Pink.
I am a huge Pink fan but this song is just NOT doing it for me AT ALLL.
the worse song i have ever heard period
the end is to good 🔥
Smashes it everytime
I dont know how to explain this but this song just screams 'middle aged white women'
Yo.  Found this one.  Killer.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5QK3K3lkOc
This is a fkin bop.
Amazing! 🙂
horrible generic garbage of a cash crab song. ddndance im gonna dance bruh?? tf were you thinking. ik what u was thinking, MONEY. the vocal performance is abysmal.

THX Pink! This one brings sunshine back in my life☀️❤️☀️!
Great song P!nk, can't wait for the album

I love being reminded that Pink is awesome! #awesome

I love this woman *-* she has been with me since my youth. Her style, her way, just great and without scandals ♡ not many can do that. She has a great balance between family and job. I wish I would stand out from the crowd more.

I did a live reading with a psychic last night and this song came through and played while we talked, "i hope you dance" was the song played at my aunts funeral and this one seems to match the emotion level i feel towards the other song based on most of the comments here. Ill now play this song and i hope you dance for her
I just love ❤this song
❤😂🎉
what a nice video ever
Best thing she's ever done
love this song
I am disabled and live with chronic pain and fatigue. But I will never not dance again! 💃💃
Love it
I discovered you today, is that bad?
Really love this song! It makes me happy inside
Sie ist eine richtige Powerfrau Ich liebe ihre Songs  Sie halten mich jung 👍❤️😍
Would have been such a good song if not for the punch. Such a downer after a great build up
😁
Like everyone has already said, "Pink is a fantastic singer, dancer, performer and all around entertainer!!!
Uh oh she swore 😜😝😛🤔😎😀😀😁🤪🙂😊😃😄🤫🤭
This is an atrocious song
P!nk all I can say is your one incredible human being. Your my idol and hero. I really needed this song! Thank you P!nk!❤️😊
Heard this song on Strictly, loved it so found out who sang it, Brilliant !!

Pink is the greatest of all the. She is my hero, help me so much thru the darkest times of my life. Thanks pink you are a true ⭐ love your music keep it up ❣️ love you 💕

THANK you for including ordinary bad asses!! I found my life's THEME SONG!!!
Fonki !
Valley Fresh Market! 👍
sorry for sleeping on this song and video
I liked this song until the hidden promotion of the devilish Lgbti ( 1:21)👎
Can someone please explain to me why I'm crying?!?!
To be happy there is no age. great song🤟
Pink wie immer ein geiles Lied
I Love it so Match 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘😂😂👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌

💃
childish

Omg guys! I don't know what happened but this is the first song I've ever liked by Pink.  I love the song and finally appreciate her voice.  Awesome!

А мы танцуем под обстрелами :)
Best song to begin 2023. Happy new year !
thank you p!ink - nz
Dropping that phone in water is the best thing pink did for that kid. Today’s youths will believe anything told to them. Like how Australia is fake? The earth being flat, how gravity is invented…   Anyways grumpy 45 year older venting and yeeting myself out there like some dumb eshay.
Pink is the best singer ever I love her music I am going to see her this summer so exited to see how pretty she is
З новим роком
Крута,а як же наші діти,тиха но крута,😓😢
I finally got my own new skates , same as yours but💜😉👊😎🙌🎶🕺🎤🎶 Thanx for the reboot on my #YOUTH #NGNDA LOVE Ya  🎶🛼🕺🎶#NGNDA 💜🖐 #pink #ourqueen #bestever #besteva 👊🇦🇺🐨🤩💜🤟
Loved this song from the first time I heard it.  Pink constantly reinvents herself.  I picture too ballroom dancers dancing to this. The song is so joyful and uplifting. A chart topper.
This should have more views.
❤
She brings me to my childhood everytime so of course i have to listen to her tonight in new years eve
Worst song i have heard in a while
Jammin’ in my jammies and tidying the house after a long day, feeling alive again 😊 1:57 doing the slide across our kitchen (((o(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)o)))♡ love Pink!
The roller skating brings the 80's back when I was in high school. Can't help but dance to anything Pink does.🛼🎶🎧
Love this song so much you beautiful goddess! Definitely makes me dance! Xx
Je l adore , et la relève est assurée sa fille peut y arriver avec une maman comme Pink 🎉  ,
No offence but when I first heard this song, I thought it was a new one from Katy Perry.
Gute Laune Song !!!!!
Dziesmiņa par prie
cade a galera do BRAZIL?
I want the name of her shoes, goddamint P!nk i'll never stop loving you
Ahhh a song about dancing, filmed in a supermarket with stranger's dancing along side. How refreshing.
Is it only me who realized they filmed this at Valley Fresh Market?
Ufffff 🌟🌟🌟😎🌟🌟🌟 the best❤️
Maravilhosa ❤️
You freaking ROCK!!!! PINK I LOVE HOW YOUR SO REAL!!
Love!!!!!!
OI
Your voice is so annoying, why you  keep yelling and screaming in  your songs
Amazing!
A melhor
Dog shit song
♥️♥️♥️
Gone, over.
What a wonderful song and tune. Takes me right back to my dancing days in the sixties and the lyrics say it all  i have kept a few of my dancing shoes from then and this takes me right back to my youth and happy memories.  Love you Pink. X
I love PINK, and those 90s pants she had in this video were amazing. Reminded me of her style back than.
I love you so much p!nk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤I'm sitting in my livingroom with my ear buds on listening to this song😂
Does anybody else just love p!inks songs and her!
💩👍🏻
Oh damn I miss those baggy jeans !!!
We need more of these music videos. just happy joyful music and happy vibes. Pink never fails to impress us. such a legend.
Whenever I hear this song, I always think of Stephen "tWitch" Boss and how he would dance to this song in his own way.
I'm obsessed with this song!! I love how after all these years you stayed true to yourself!
On a tinny radio it sounds like _I'm never gonna lap dance again_
What an amzing song 💚💛❤
I prefer this much better than anti hero
Super singer... awesome singing voice
I hope that someday someone will find this comment (and like it).
I just love Pink.And this new song is the ultimate and awesome.Plus I love dancing heaps.
🥰
This woman cannot be a real human; she's mind-blowingly talented in so many ways, active in vital causes, takes no shi+ from anyone, gorgeous at EVERY age, and an all-round decent person. I wanna go to her planet!!
Staying in hospital with complicated jaw fractures (bike accident), needed to eat only liquid food for fucking TEN WEEKS - and THIS comes right from my heart, a promise to myself: I NEVER GONNA NOT DANCE AGAIN 👯‍♂️💃
💕🎼💕🥰💖
I love this song
The dog lyric lost me
예 저에게는 생소하지만 저도 여러분 생각과 같습니다 핑크 허리에 미팅 안락한 예 아주 좋아합니다 많이 많이 사랑해요
we are going to you concert
💛
Pour ma prisc qui nous regarde depuis les etoi'es

My 5yr old girl LOOOVES you pink !
Girl I Love U, helped me all my years an Stll  have impact   Pink
BULLSHIT....THIS AINT PINK!
Pink going to have every dance troupe and company performing to this song great marketing strategy
What I love about pink she is same throw all this years in every thing 😍😍♥️ love you
Rubbish I feel like if I hear da da da da da again I'm going to distoy my brother speaker
I normally love everything from Pink but this one is terrible.
Love this Pink new song..👌😋💃💃💖🌹
I love the stevie wonder flavor to it:)
Stupid song. End of Story.
FLOPPPPP. Even Madonna’s desperate new remixes have got more views than this
I like pink, but my ears actually started to bleed listening to this
I wonder in years  what's pinks song gonna be ?? As for instance  dolly Parton 9 to 5
Boring Been Done Before!!!!   Not Original
Ugh
The song really gives me Disney vibes. When I hear this song I always think about the film Rio. She slayed as always 🩷💖
So wasn't this the same person, who early in her career, did not want producers pushing her to be a bubblegum pop star and made so much fun of the performers that did go that route? Now here she is with this lame song, sounding like a disco-era pop star trying to make a comeback, complete with roller skating video.
I dedicate this to all mums who are raising special needs children.
To my mind this is P!nk's statetment that the pandemic is over.   And even if it's not over, it's still fucking over.  So I'm going to go out and live and celebrate and be happy again and not afraid.
really poor video. what were u thinking? did a 5 year old produce this?
It is a good video of 2022 and a good dance video you saw this year
She aging fineee..👌
❤❤❤❤❤
Definitely number one
20 plus years and P!nk keeps making us happy. P.S.: Love the Whitney reference.
Just one word: AWESOME!!
What an uplifting song. She always knows how to make music that you can turn up and move to even if you're having a horrible day. An amazing and respected artist for her skills, time spent, talent, positivity, strength, and love. Thank you p!nk!!!
Never gonna lap dance again
Her voice is so amazing.
Oh yes, I do the shopping on my rollerskates!
Great somg ,think this might get to number 1.
She sounds like Katy Perry.
Love ya
I love you P!nk 💖
I love you, and how you bring the world of enlightenment! Thank you for caring and motivational song. Love you 😍
Nice song..., butt maybe.., wish you a luck!
Absolutely love this song and can’t resist getting up and dancing round the house ♥️
Sensacional p!nk como siempre. Única e inigualable. Pura energía
top 10 most annoying songs ever
i played roller skate. i loved it. but i aint a pro. 2 months ago i broke my knee and tear my ACL. im on home rehab and doing limited workout with unknown recovery result. until i get my MRI again prolly next month. this song came out and hit me, and i want to regain my strength again for my healthyness. i need to fight again. seems like only hope that can remind me to dont stop doing the all tiring rehab. and i need to not loose hope.
Alternate title: when shopping at Ralph’s goes yass
geht das auch auf deutsc
Love her song even when I’m sad while driving Uber and hear this song I get so happy and dance in my car Onway to riders lol I even put the volume higher when I have people in my car lol.
Why dose this make me emotional?
Por mais letras assim❤️ mulher você é incrível, não te conhecia, amei suas músicas, sua essência,  você é única... Que Paz... Que letra... Poesia pura❤️❤️❤️
This song is the actual definition of an artist who has ran out of ideas and needs to earn some money from her blind/deaf followers quickly … “never gonna NOT dance again” 😂
every poppy song this woman makes slaps the shit out of me <3
The song is absolutely dogshite
#R.I.P Twitch
Every few years, I keep getting reminded why I adore Pink. Her sheer, unadulterated IDGAF joy that she’s able to give in music form.
Love the song and the videoclip👏🙃
Been here for 20 years🫶🏽 love you!!!!
Pink back at her best 💗
Never stop never stopping!.
I’m so sorry for you
I’m not a Pink-fan, but this is a great tune!
💕
❤️
Honestly , Justin Timberlake should now just simply take the pink bitch to the court.
Lizzo and Pink make a sing together!!! I need you both!!!!
Stripper retirement song: "I'm never gonna lapdance again".
Ik hou van deze vrouw! Wat een strot en geweldige lyrics! 🤩🤩
welcome back Pink in 2022 :)
I want some roller skates 🛼 awesome song!
For some reason I suspended both my Twitter accounts I don't know why this is Rik later
I'm going to Pinks world tour next year I've loved her music since the album Mizunderstood love this B 🤟💙💛💚🧡
BALLLLLLLLLERRRRRRRRRRRR
Get Usher to do a remix and redo a video because he is amazing on some skates. They would sound awesome together
Fucking hate shit like this and it's played to death on radio .so I can't escape it at work. Who listens to this shit.
me and my mom ❤️ pink
Best videoclip ever...❤️❤️❤️Pink
We used this song for our finally dance!!! My dance school loves it!
This song makes me think of a credits of an old series, kind The Love Boat 🤣🤣🤣
Pink! you are way to cool, awesome, best singer voice ever! Smart way to have us having fun, dance, sing and THINK ....
Congrats on almost 12k subs!!💞
Good cheesy music
Jag hörde denna låt i dag skit bra man blir glad  och pink är tillbaka härligt ❤️med sina bra texter
RIP DJ TWITCH
Bless you Judy , keep on dancin
I'm NEVER gonna not dance again!!!!!!!
❤ Great song! Hope you come to Stockholm Sweden soon ⁠❤
Can't wait to see her live at Hyde Park next year.she is brilliant
I hate this dumb song! Words are so stupid. Couldn't believe it's by Pink - she does have some great songs. This one is a real stinker tho 😖
Pink just keeps getting more and more inspirational. I remember as a kid I would have what I didn’t know were depression/anxiety attacks and I would sit in my closet and listen to / sing pink because I could identify so so so much with her songs and they made me feel less alone growing up with an alcoholic step father. It’s so crazy to me how someone you’ve never met can support you through all of the seasons of your life. What a blessing Pink is thank you!!
Great,most uplifting song ever! Love you Pink!❤❤❤❤❤
Awesome ! Song
Wow !! ..... Pink ? .... she'd be "red raw" if I had my chance !!
Please don't ever use my story again steal from someone else they're good at that
Oh great! Another artist who fell of the radar and now is forcing her way back by singing songs she genuinely doesn't believe in! Getting sick of these old artists making come backs when they initially went on a break!
I really had a shitty day and I needed this more than anything right now, thanks P!nk
Estava sentindo falta de um música dançante assim, parabéns, Pink!!
Fabulous pink💕💕💕💕
love it  💛💙💚❤💜💖💗💟
pink song is the best I hear
My new mantra!!❤❤
At first it was good but i’ ve been hearing this song a million times a day at work and it pisses me of. Like i just hate it!!!!!!
I like it, but The question is: Who looks like those “st#pid girls” you used to make fan of? 🤔  😂 😂 😂
https://youtu.be/8_RLDBuMtzM
This song give vibes of Justin's  "Can't Stop the Feeling!"
das ist doch mal wieder ein gute laune song
Awesome ...thank goodness you stuck to your vision Pink!
Every time I go into a grocery store I will remember this song
Love this new song by pink..
I LOVE PINK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Happiness in this song is infectious
super co za odjazd 😁👍👍👍
love this song so much❤
Art.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Sweetheart you not really know how you safe...for ever in my heart
Thank you lovely lady. There is still hope that I will be dancing again, even though I am 60 :) <3
🥲💖🙏🕊💕✨🫂
Thanks P!nk. I'm sitting here smiling by myself listening to this in the midst of struggle. May you always pink!. 😊
I love this song and I won a fan badge 🤩 for you so I have pink streaks in my hair to celebrate badge I will send pic this is a new favourite awesome song 🥰
Love Pink.... but this seems to be a video for youtube she seems to play to it not the true "her"
Never gonna not listen to Pink!
I love this song :D
Do you think am a especial person present my ears
I'm in love with this song ((-:
I want my life to be a P!nk song
I don't think there is a song of hers I don't love.
YESS YES YESS OH MY GOSH LET'S DANCE🌈🌈🌈 AGAIN HAPPY MERRY CHRISTMAS ☃☃☃
What I really love about this video (besides the absolutely banging song) is the fact, that every dance move depicted here is something a normal person could bust out. Even the stuff on the roller skates is not that hard if you can use them safely. In many other videos, where "normal" people suddenly start dancing, it is either a well developed group choreography or insane moves for advanced dancers. Not here. And by the way, "Turkey-Leg-Guy" has stolen my very own, personal move-set. I'm angry now. 😆
Beautiful song
I instantly could tell this is a Max Martin song, great work!
Pink you have always been such an inspiration to others may God continue to bless your health, your family and everything you do.  Thank you for always coming back hard and being such a touching soul❤️🙏🏻🎶
I really needed this song! I’m so happy to hear her voice, the nostalgia the pure joy!
It's sad when you lose a lot of people that you love and you realize that you're the one that should be gone but life has to go on and like pink says never not going to dance
pink making the world dance again
absofuckinglutely brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seem Pink twice...amazing woman and down to earth. Keepin it real as always
This song is truly something special !  simply awesome ! a great catchy tune , 62 and i,m listening to this ...... Prog Rock, Soul,Folk, Blues and now Pink 😁😂
Heard this song for the 1st time today. I want to roller skate so bad!!
Wow. This is a real banger. Pink takes it to another level once again!!
Just throwing this out there to the Music Gods - but I'd love to see a P!nk and Betty Who Collab!
I thought pink sang: I’m not never gonna lapdance again
Richtig toller Gutelaune Song👍😘
My wife is totally fine with me being in love with PINK! I🥰
im gonna say Pink is to pop as Eminem is to rap. she is the best...
<3
Ok un
Buen viaje amigo
Ai mano esse clipe é tão bonito,ele tem uma coloração linda sério,ele faz você se sentir liberto,livre pra cantar,dançar e se expressar da forma que você quiser,a p!nk voltou com tudo,eu amei esse conceito,eu já tou preparado pra esse seu novo álbum😍😍😍😍😩😩😩😩💗💗💗💗👏👏👏👏🗣🗣🗣🗣🌌🌌🌌🌌
ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ ..KISSES FROM GREECE
Love this song, Love Pink!!!
La numéro 1 tellement ate d'aller à son concert ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She’s so authentic I love it 😬
Why am I in tears after dancing my butt off to this song?!   wowwowwowow She is my forever fav.
You have Gaga you have queen b you have Madonna BUT pink is from a a ohter level 🥰
The fact she can rollerskate and I cant😭
Yes this ! , A great come back track!
This song makes me so so so happy. It’s been a long time but rn I feel so seen and heard ❤
Why am I crying.   Okay I think it's because this song makes me hopeful and wonder if we can wake up from this techno zombie dream. Well not a techno zombie.. that'd be cool. I mean how life = Twitter Facebook tiktok, etc. Will we ever "dance" again? If you know what I mean. I stopped listening to mainstream music for a few years and I'm pleased to see that we are finally doing something interesting. We're getting creative again.  It was so dark. Maybe it was what happened in the last couple years. In history, we can see that amazing things can come out of a situation like that. I hope we can be human again. For me, my kids, for all the kids out there. They deserve a real life.
Tu  U😅
Hope you're still dancing girl
Ridiculously cool woman.
I love Pink! I want to see her live so badly.
perfect Partysong! Nice in this darktimes!
i love p!nk
Thank you so much for this song for the last several days I have been in such a dark place I ready to leave this world but your song has got me dancing again I AM GOING KEEP ON LIVING AND I AM A CHAMPION
Theme song. Dancing and music is something that can lift you you up and make you feel better always and this song pretty much sums it up. Pink… you crushed it. Thank you.
She's a maniac. I adore her.
man..I heard this song while driving and really liked it.  Glad the DJ mentioned the artist and not surprised it was P!nk!
yes ! welcome back pink ! I think you have done it again, yet again.! luv ya girl____ from Oz, (Australia, Down under).
luv u!
Why this so low im view it is so amazing i m back again
There's something so uniquely special about Pink- she somehow manages to give the world precisely what they need.. when they need it. How one person can please the entire world- is as mind blowing as it is beautiful 💞
First time in a long time that I skipped on the comments to watch the video first.
I absolutely love this song and the music video is great too! The song brings me so much joy, also makes me feel emotional, P!nk's voice is so special and always goes right to my heart! For some reason felt like I needed to hear this at this exact moment of my life!!! Thank you P!nk!
Love it
Godd nice👍🙏
P!nk is 43, but looks 23. She is a true, pure soul, and led me through many dark years and kept me from drowning. Love u Mrs Moore!
Commercial garbage
We'll meet in Berlin next year,  I'm really looking forward to it 😍
@SelenaGomez #SelenaGomez  Are you ready to shake your money maker yet? Are you mad that you can't wear your fancy clothes in my hometown because you'll stick out and get bullied again?  That won't happen around me.  Trust me. I have weapons now, not just my fists.  That's why no one from my past will come near me.  Because they all know they were racist assholes and still are.
Why can't be we   easy as P!NK does? We focus on the pain, arguing, hating etc.. All we need is dance the fukking hated things away.
I wish I could understand the words
Walking in life seeing what the world will teach before life end.cv
Best song of 2022!!!!
I heard this on the radio yesterday and my first thought was "this sounds a lot like Can't Stop The Feeling by Justin Timberlake" low and behold, the video is also very similar.
sorry for my german school english...i had to heard this song about 5 times....but now i love it,pink,your daughter have to be proud of you ! I love you both <3 <3 <3
I love you pink the best always ❤
BTW: This remembers me of "You Wanna Teach Me To Dance - Tina Dico"
This is the best music  😘😘😘🥳🥳🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 ,  Hello from Slovenia 🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮👍
This has the same spirit as So What and I love that so much.
Şarkının her tarafı her detayı pozitif. Klip sözler müzik hepsi çok güzel. Yemeyi içmeyi bırakın. Dans zamanı
It is an absolute DISGRACE that this only has 7.1 million views, one month in.  Shame, y'all.  What's the world coming to??
🔴Our house in the middle of our street 💸 By madness (plagia)🔴.       😅😂
This songs just topped up pinks retirement fund , what a banger ❤
La numero #1 pink ❤
I feel like Britney Spears inspired this song. I kind of feel like it was written in part for Britney as well 🥰
Pink is the absolute queen of Life Tunes. Even if you act mature, Pink's music and videos reflect the voices inside us.
Yeah "take her soul"
She’s so blessed with that voice of hers!!
Shes juat amazing. Her growth over the years as been beautiful to watch.  Her voice has always been phenomenal but she's an entertainer to the fullest but always a message in her music. Love ❤️
Impressive body of work.
❤❤❤ love you pink! 99 baby will always love you!!!
P!nk, Brazil loves u ❤️🇧🇷
I miss the P!NK we had like 10 years ago, what is this crap? She used to be one of the best in the game, this is some generic ass basic shit.
cool
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!
this is overplayed on uk radios
Love love love ❤️❤️ thank you for this
Love all song of pink .love 💗
Please, come to Berlin, queen!!!
National anthem of Walmart people
It was everything I hoped it would be and more!  Love this woman!!! 🫵👏🙏❤️
P!NK always delivers. What a song.
First chord of the chorus is sweet
Oh I missed P!nk sooooo much ❤ This song is everything!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤looooove it
Pink is so underrated. Her voice, her songs❤❤❤ super 90’s vibes 🎧
My son committed suicide, and for a few years there, I was okay to die too... but something clicked back on and this song is going to be my power anthem as a reminder that it's okay to keep going. Guilt and all.
Someone is desperately trying to fit in the pop and staying relevant. You've done better, way better

Not a huge Pink fan but I admire her energy and effort. She still looks great in 2022, just saying.
I want to go to a dance party with Pink!  Thank you for making this song and video - we need some brightness and joy right now ❤🥰❤
Thx Pink for lifting our spirits up in this shitty times!You go girl!!!!
**ATTENTION PINK OR ASSOCIATE**  Pink I am a Nobody and All the Christmas programs going on.. They All focus on like 15 or even really like 13/14 and younger ... I wanted to do a fundraiser for 14 to 18/19 year old foster children or just of less fortunate families in general also those aging out of the system... Go Fund me charges too many fees and as I said I'm a Nobody and don't want people thinking I'm trying to embezzle money!!
Watching again.  Sooooo cool!
ALECIA BETH MOORE!!🧡💚💜💛💙❤️___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This song is seriously so inspiring. I am proud of myself for feeling the same way you feel. Thank you for putting the perfect words together. I hope others know never to give up.

P!NK - Never Gonna Not Dance Again - very good - Czech republic internetové rádio Géčko 🥰🥰🥰
we miss like these song. reminded me katy perry from 2012
Jackhalley2005
I’m not particularly fond of this single, but I love her!! I cannot wait for the new album! She always got something for me! Welcome back P!nk
Through all the years I've been concious enough to have taste in music, P!nk has always been at the top of my favorites  and she sure as hell hasn't lost her magic. Love ya, queen!
I wish I could send this to you 🚀🫀🍇🥣🏄‍♀️  I love so many things about this I could just explode! I love Pink so much for so so so many reasons. It’s my huge life wish to just see her in concert or like just have lunch. She’s such a cool woman I admire and would love to know as a human. 🤗 This is totally my new hype song. 🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️
Okay so she mom right now bat🤦🏼‍♀️ tis music not not I'm not like sorry pink  please you drink one cafe and wake up !!!
I love it ❤
Love Pink 💕💕 This song is fantastic, heard it in my car driving home from work tonight had to turn the volume up, stopped at traffic lights the guy next to me had the same radio station on he was bopping away🤣🤣🤣
I've been feeling like this since way before I was her age. Good for her and smiles 😃 from me
Can this please become the club Q song please to show the world hate wont stop what love really is.
The fact that I can hear Willow's voice at the end in choir with other kids...Pink you are awesome. What a Mommy and you have outwitted and outlasted some very famous artists look at this outkast outstanding.
Love Pink! This song is awesome,  gives me that "skating at the roller rink" vibe. Love it.
Congrats Pink! Life is a dancerloor! 😍🎉
Pink is Perfection!! Love this song!!
P!nk has always been my role model even at the age of 38 I would give anything if I could look like her not give a sh!t like her and just have her attitude. Just about everyone of her songs feel like she has been singing about MY LIFE. I'm still struggling and guess I always will... but much love to u P!NK u are the BEST!! KEEP DOING U
Though Linda Perry leaves the room,  it still puts me in a good mood. Go Pink!
It is my personal headcanon that every single concenience store comes with built in disco lights just in case a random girl breaks out into song
Dancing used to be a passion for me. But I'm always afraid of what others will think.. even in my own home growing up... I heard this song and I was cleaning one day and felt the urge to dance hearing it... let me tell you... I danced my heart out with my children on hip and broom in hand!!
°🤖💢P¡NK RETURNE❤!!! YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS💎
Best song I’ve ever heard from PINK hands down !
Incredible P!nk. At the age of 43 looking so fresh and sounding even more fresh, never loosing your musicality!!! AWE!
That was hilarious that's something I'd do haha
Vanilla Ice's brother looks great!
Iam addicted  to this song,PINK still kicking ass.
That Looked like a Lot of Fun Doing!🙂👌
I got goosebumps listening to this...
Going through divorce and it came up on my mixes- thank you for giving me hope
I love ❤️ this song 🎵 ❤️
Queen of all music HANDS DOWN!!!!!!!!

Pure class.
Absolutely unreal tune!!! Great fun video
She's amazing, will always be amazing!
you don't know how much i needed this... LONG TIME FAN P!NK  YOU ARE INCREDIBLE. thank you for being my life long role model and my forever girl crush 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤
Have a bit of fun then hurt myself.
Ouchies
Heard a snippet of the chorus while watching part of an interview just now & the song grabbed me and brought me here it was instant! so catchy, and feel good🤩The chorus is going to keep playing in my head until the next time I hear it. Yes pink you done did it again💃🏽🪩💓
Hehe my girlies hope that Willow sings and does acrobatics during the tour. I just freaking love the music and Pink and Brandi Carlile are my favorite artists. So excited for the 412 dates.
Thank You Pink
I bet there is a little bit linda perry in it😁
Absolutely love you
P!NK still got it after three decades and I sure wish I was in the supermarket roller-skating and dancing with P!NK! 💃
Brilliant song new single from pink she has always come up with a good song
Just Amazing.....you Rock!  Thank you for being you!
P!nk never not got it. Total bop!
Pop Single Of 2022 ❤️
She's the best!!👌👌
😍💃
You just cant knock quality in a record, and this song embodies all the elements that make this a sure fire number 1 hit. A hard hitting chorus line, a great disco beat line and a message that lives strong in the hearts of everyone who ever loved to hit the dance floor, it brings back that 70s 80s Nightclub feel when real music was just so abundant, rarely do i ever hear a record these days that just makes you wanna get down and dance your ass off, but this record is going nowhere other than straight to the very top of the record charts. Dave Hayes ( Bad for your ears 70s Disco DJ Oxford.)

💕💕
Lost my dad almost 10 months ago. He would be 52 on Christmas Eve and I played this song on Thanksgiving on repeat. This song and the people I was with made the happiest I’ve been in almost 10 months. Thank you Pink! You made me forget about my pain for a day and remind that it’s ok for me to be happy even if my dad isn’t physically with me anymore.
Heard this today...I'm loading this one
Pink jest jak wino im starsza tym lepsza
Such an uplifting song. I'm 60 and this really lifts my spirit. Bravo pink. Dance on
I am a 45 year old white man, and this woman is my goddamn hero.
Just wanna point out how uncool it is to slut shame when you've got sex positive lyrics in a lot of your songs including this one. I hope she's grown out of dragging other women, because it really isn't the feminism-baddie-move she once treated it like. If you're gonna drag the kardashians--drag them for being thieves who profit off of POC labor and plagiarize literally everything.   Not because of a sex tape leak. That shit's weak and who tf cares about one more porn vid on the internet? She's no more a slut for having sex than Pink is for doing it twice and conceiving kids. Nor is she a slut for posing half naked--Pink's done that shit too.   You got two daughters, do you want them growing up to think that sex is bad and that they're "dumb sluts" if they ever have it? Or that wearing certain clothes and bathing suits is "slutty?" Do you want them to live restricted out of guilt? You didn't, but you got ALL this mouth over and I couldn't find one record of her apologizing or owning up that she's BEEN wrong.  I grew up listening to Pink as a 16 year old,  I'm 32 now, and I've been fairly disappointed by the untrue, uneducated things that have come out of her mouth since.
Pink has been going strong since the mid 90s..very rare for artists from that Era to maintain their level on fame. Eminem comes to mind as well.
Am I the only one that wrote “never gonna Give you up”
I love Pink and this is another great song from her  , just these rainbow flags,  God is OK to be straight.  Don't need so much publicity,  it's just too much.  We have to understand that there exist straight people to.
What is there to say really? ... She is always present, can't make a bad song even if she wants to. Luv her
P!NK Is back, My Idol Is back, I love Her New single ''Never Gonna Not Dance Again'' & The Music Video Is Funny!!! 🥰🤘
First P!nk song I actually like, this one's great!
The time is ✨ now. 🌈 I LOVE this song and video and artist!!!
Amiga esse é seu canal
Finally someone that will take criticism and help save their failing restaurant
Wie geil ist das denn?👍👍👍🎶
I have never loved an artist and I certainly do not idolize them either...but I do LOVE Pink..she is a person I could so hang wtih!
This song Rocks! Love u pink ur an amazing artist!
I love this song so much!!!!!!!!!  🌹✨
Liked this song, then i started hearing it 20 times a day on the radio at work and now i absolutely hate it
🔝💥
Everything about Pink just gets better with age x

Fans de Paulina Rubio apoyando a pink ❤
I think Pink's best song. An awesome performer and down to earth.
Best music video in ages. No nudity, no vulgarity. Just positive vibes.
❤️❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖
Love the song, not the Hollywood agenda.  The rainbow flag is a sign of surrender....not LGBTQ
Love from México ❤️
It’s been a long time, I love your music all sounds in harmony 🥰
For those who grew up listening to pink and are already in their 30s or 40s, this song reminds me that I definitely shouldn't stop dancing if I want to.
she don't give a fuck
love to see a representing pride flag! representation matters please never stop loving yourself!
Hammer
This is the land where nothing changes  The land of red buses and blue blooded babies  This is the place, where pensioners are raped  And the hearts are being cut from the welfare state  Let the poor drink the milk while the rich eat the honey  Let the bums count their blessings while they count the money
👏 👏🔥🔥
anyone know who her two skaters are?
She keeps us dancing.  Thanks Pink
Amazing as always! Pink, great talent, cool, smart and amazing human being!
Who forbids her to dance? I don’t understand. This song doesn’t have any sense. It is clearly made for “soccer moms” or middle-aged women from suburbs. Please stop with this kind of generic music.
Sensacional!!!!🤩🤩🤩
this is how u gonna start ur new album gurl? 😭
something off with this song
Djumma   friday   djumma le djinns soundsystem
Aaaahnd..she did it AGAIN!! 🎉
Super gemacht
I just want to Dance with you please Kansas City Missouri
Please come over and SKATE.
Espectacular Pink.
You can always rely on P!nk to provide an anthem to come out to, several others have been my friends', this is mine
idol
P!nk never disappoints.
That titles a double negative
🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
Pop is easy for Pink. Pink’s voice is suitable for R&B, rock.
Did it once as a child shopping groceries for my mom with my inline skaters on. Since then there has been a sign up at the door: no inline skaters inside :-D Didn't even destroy sth... :D
Pink always delivers !!
leave it to pink!!! to release this booty shaking toe tapping dancing song at a tyme when there's more negativity than I've ever seen in 3three decades!!! I'm talking war, countries fighting, gang violence, people being genuinely sh*ty to  1one another!!!.... people are divided n displaced from their homes, jobs not paying enough to live by yourself or evena couple when 1one doesn't get disability like my situation I'm not working  in a wheelchair n my hubby works n is desperately trying to take care of us both only on his salary 'on 1one check we are trying!!!, people moving in wit fam, friends n other's jus to get by!.... so I say it 'homeless'.... americans see what's going on n our great country has been being run into the ground by democrats n republicans alike actually all parties in politics can be a part of the problem so why not be part of the global  solution, it's all our problem now!!! someting has to change n happen cause the old ways, most aren't working now....  it's tyme for the new to create someting where we all need to work twords a better for people's, the environment, the animal's,!!! ya know all us on the planet earth!!! jus had to get that off my chest.... luv n blessings!!! S2'
PINK, GREAT MUSIC BUT  U ARE SO BUTCH ..LOL YOU AND JASON MOMOA IS A MATCH ! FREE HIPPIE SPIRIT... YOUR VIDEO HAVE A BAD INFLUENCE FOR THE YOUNG GENERATION...THEY LOOK AT THIS AND THEY THINK ITS OKAY TO BEHAVE THIS WAY , I CAN DRESS, ACT LIKE THIS ...I DONT GIVE A COW ABOUT ANYTHING.....PINK USED TO BE KOOL CALM W CLASS AND STYLE...WHAT WENT WRONG?
Was that Denali? o.o
PINK.... has changed the way of music. Total icon, she fucking is my inspiration for everything.  She made me realize that everything and anything this possible.  Luv you xoxox n thanks
Love you Pink!!!
for 20 years, she will always be a great great super performer, speakin' on real issues thru her songs.  Wonder why she wuz never been as a SUPERBOWL HALFTIME performer.  By 2024 PINK SHOULD BE A SUPER BOWL HALFTIME PERFORMER.  she is really awesome and amazing.
This hits so hard 💕✨
My Monday morning motivational song!
Pipeyes Taco truck from Santa Barbara
Hello from Russia with VPN
lowkey forgot abt pink
Fabulous revive an empty spirit song. Well guess what my spirit is alive again after this song. Thank you!
she kicked ass at the amas! ive seen her 3 times & she blew my mind. go pink!!!
1:38 I thought for a second that's Brooke Candy...but I was wrong :(
I know how you feel. But life goes on. Your husband would not like you to be like this. So hopefully you will eventually find light at the end of the dark tunnel. ?
The best Song of the year , i love this Song 😃😃😃😃👍👍👍👍
1/10 not the greatest song  Pure garbage.
Her style 😍💕😍💕😍
Awesome song!
❤️❤️
💪🌻😁🌟
Dayum pink you slayed girl 🙌🏼
You are my favorite artist and so beautiful and the voice of a angel and you are so hilarious 😂
Great song
I love pink her music gets me x
SUCH A BOP! let's make it trend!
The dance routine at 1:55 gives me Robyn vibes <3
I first thought this would be a cover of Careless Whisper
You can hear her daughter's voice in the backup vocals, I love how subtle it is, Willow's voice is so beautiful and I love how she includes her daughter in her projects!
I needed this, thank you
This is me, dancing is my passion and feeds my soul.
Love the song well done
Perfect!
Pink!!! Always broadening your showmanship 🎉🎉🎉 I love this & love your music!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love Pink!
Love it!❤🎉
Diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer Monday. I was the Dancing Queen in the late 70’s and we also went to Roller rinks. This made me cry. I want to dance again.
užastna Pink😍👍👍👍
Who wrote this? Justin Timberlake?  Anyway I LOVE IT
The world might be ending, but at least we can dance still, they can't take that from us!
I feel like this song has a whole new meaning after Colorado Springs. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Feels like this one song by Justin Timberlake... Love it! Can´t stop this feeling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru0K8uYEZWw
Love pink
Thank you so much for this song. You just made my 2 year old Boy and I dance. It's an amazing feeling to be alive with my son. He came 3 months early and I almost died. So now we celebrate life. This song is so freaking amazing. Hope you come to Denmark again sometime, so I can take my son to one of your concerts. 😀
Pink Is  Brilliant....That's All I'm Gonna Say...... 👍👍👍🙂
I'm crying this song makes me so damn happy <3
I think this fantastic. I am a 65yr old and I really enjoyed it, reminds me of old Pink.
Omg!
Pink tetap terbaikq , stunninng smga km bs duet sm Agnezmooo
Good tune 🇬🇧
This song represents the spirit of soo many of us in the LGBTQ community. The attacks against our community have happened in places where we go to feel accepted… and DANCE!  As I listen to the lyrics my eyes swell with tears for those lives lost… simply because they wanted to dance.  I will never gonna NOT dance again! 🌈
PURA LUMBRE  ???? JIMI HURTADO GARCIA  VIVA PINK  22/11/2022
Who's here because of the Olivia newton tribute with Pink?
Woke up this morning and listened to your song and it made me dance (though I am not a dancer)...It lightened my feeling as I am struggling emotionally, I am an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) here in Dubai...59 yrs old, and a grandmother...missing my family in the Philippines so much...Just praying that I can retire next year comfortably to be able to dance with my husband, children, and grandchildren.  I love you Pink❤💯
Hi pink can you please send me   the  video    you cover  of  olivia john because  I  missed it    thanks for sharing it   we love  yr music   my son has  some of  yr cds so far

An amazing artist I'd pay over and over to see you live again one in a million artist of all time ❤️
Ok Pink. U did your thang on this song. I came across it on FB and I was like, let me hear what Pink talking about on this single.  I love it tho.
All I have is love for this!
Todo lo que haces, es simplemente hermoso 🥰 muchas bendiciones 🥰 GRANDE PINK 😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰
Brilliant song! Pink is stunning and stupendous always 💖
Ich habe nichts anderes erwartet.... Chapeau🎩
So awesome absolutely love Pink. Great tribute to Olivia Newton John on the AMA's too.❤
Hey Pink, how did you discover my life purpose?  Thank you for reaching out to all the Dancing Soul Sisters!
Swedish pop perfection! Max Martin and Shellback did good on this! 🎉
❤️🎶🎵🌻✨
Wow!! It's time to give it up, Pink.
This song screams “make the most of life!!”
"I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song!" Yessssssssssss 🥰
I'm keeping my dog Pink.  He dances with, and is really the only flaw in this song.(;))  I love you and thank you so much bring this from the spark.  You were absolutely beautiful at the AMA BtW!!
Wow!  Another smash hit & hit video!
omg! at 2:52 Taylor Swift makes a surprise cameo!!!
I love you
If the Ellen show, was still on, I think this would be her new theme song
Queen
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this, you never fail to bring it! ❤️
Pink just makes me happy 😊
Just so joyful!
My theme song :):) LOVE IT!!!!!
Why isn't this pop disco masterpiece by the fabulous Pink not in the billboard top 10??? WTF...Its so catchy. Really infectious and sticks in your head for days. Get those dreadful vulgar rap songs by loser Drakeula out the top 10 in stick Pink there.  Pink also killed if on the AMA 2022.
Fantastic and Amazing song and video💜💜💜💜
Never stop stopping.
¿Porqué P!nk siempre tiene la canción correcta en cada etapa de tu vida? 🫶
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So good !!! 💖👌
Never has an artist shown as much REAL confidence as P!nk
Awesome Pink, as always
In Europe
children and adults are going hungry

Blow me one last kiss copied and pasted. Pink hasnt changed since 1999. She knows the winning formula. It works. Why changing it?

Paying Homage to the one and only Whitney Houston in the lyrics ❤️❤️❤️ P!nk knows best 🤍🤍🤍
She is something else. Always a natural, never boring. This is a great catchy tune, just in time for holiday season.  (1:24 That's what I feel like doing sometimes, but I am mot as cool as Pink 😁😁)
Oh Gurl can you please stop giving us your awesomeness .. give someone else a go … SAID WHO 🤷‍♀️🌹😂 love from Oz
Well, that's a banger 😊

Weak comeback, wrong lead single, please pink save the situation with another single and we promise we’ll forget about this
I am 74 and the gene in my body is Never Gonna Not Dance is just what I feel . Thank you Pink for keeping me young in my heart and body . Wish I had an opportunity to be in one of your videos . It is on my bucket list. Just to show people age is just a number. Cause I have the  BEAT in my feet and a smile  that can't be BEAT!
Amoooo🥰🇧🇷❤🙏
Well that was a big happiness injection. Just love Pink ❤️
pink always rocking her songs, another hit like so many others
God loves you
Once again PINK you did it,  just out of spine surgery, one of the worst days and here you come I see you in that outfit omg and on wheels gal, that song just instantly makes you happy!! What a voice, what power to move someone's emotions from the pits to loads of fun.
She never changes her style It’s like we are watching 2009 song Wow  I love this One of low key female artist that puts a smile on our faces
🤣🤣🤣🤣brilliant as usual but it should have been fimed in Wallmart with those characters😂😂
Most try hard fake person that's ever lived

Jamming I Loves it
I love you! no matter what happens! you're dance is great, and your human chosing was so wonderful! Thank you so much, for living, when I'm living! in on this earth! this song title should be, … hmm, "dance floor in miami" or "You are so humble". (I just imagined sitting with P!NK's music producers and enthused, poped out)wondered. Your voice is so living!
Lol laugh
Lol need some love in the world
Her AMA performance of this song was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
thank you for always sending us love p!nk. you have been there for me a few times now when I feel like my worlds struggling. and your still not disappointing <3
Looking forward to seeing her next summer! Been wanting to see her for the longest time
Love this song!!❤️😊
I have been a Pink fan since "There You Go". I can't hear this song and not move!
PIIINNNK! ❤❤❤
Here because of the music awards
That was the craziest Instacart commercial ever.
Honestly she will never stop suprise words with creativity 👏 amazing artist 🥰🥰
Not bad. 🙃
Love you babe, your a star
I love pink but WHY WHY WHY does every song now have to have swearing or sex??? WHY can't we just have a fun clean song?? It sucks but this will be the last time I listen to  her.
I love this song! This should encourage everyone to not allow anything negative to take away your desire and passion to dance! Dancing is a great part of life! It makes you feel good!
Poderosa ♥️
Realmente amo a esta mujer,💞💌 no hay nada que no pueda hacer y toda su música siempre tiene una moraleja o se burla de un tema que es absurdo✨🤭😍
I love me some PINK awesome energy song as usual. Love it.
This brings me back to the old Pink from the early 2000's. ❤
She did it again! Amazing, funny, crazy song🤩🤩🤩
Got me some tickets, oh yes!!!
I just bought tickets for her summer carnival tour. I'm so excited!!!!
在这个音乐视频的最后的部分，有这个男人，他在推车里面这辆推车有这个疯狂的歌手女人
在这个音乐视频有其中一个女人在抽烟，这个视频有这个女人吃冰淇淋，然后冰淇淋从这个女人的手出来，然后将落在地上
在这个音乐视频，他们都是在购物一些食物，然后得到这些食物，然后犯贱推测离
在这个视频有这个歌手和这个老女人在推车，然后他们都是崩溃了，一起再用推车里面这家超市
这个视频有其中一个很胖，很胖的男人看起来像个平板的中国男人，他看起来像他在吃饭
这首歌听起来像这首歌没有不好的坏话，然后我知道了，这首歌有不好的坏话，都是看起来像很奇怪的
这个视频有一些溜冰鞋
我还在没有忘记了，这个歌手还在会说一些不好的坏话，我还在不想再听说着，我还在不想再听到
我没有忘记了，这首歌有不好的坏话，我不想再听到
这个音乐视频有一些人在用溜冰鞋

P!nk firin' on all cylinders once again!  Damn how fast this tune stuck in my head!
Lost my mum 2 months ago😢 & my beautiful rescue greyhound 2 weeks ago. This song filled me with joy when I needed it!! Adore Pink ❤
flop
smokin like a hippie stuck in the 70's😅😂🤘💚
super clip dans un shopping avec des supers couleurs une musique qui donne envie de danser la grande classe comme à chaque fois🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒
You go my sister. PINK.🥰🥳🎉.
Showy ohno exception  for pink
Saw her 2018 Beautiful Trauma tour. So lucky what an outstanding fearless performer 💖🪩🇦🇺
Pink has always inspired me 2 follow my dreams
My most favorite singer 🤟💌This song brings so much joy 🥳🎉Her music has always been very unique and indeed very inspiring Not to forget their dances are Awesome, brings back the memories of her 90s dancing..Totally love it 😊😊 Thank you, P!NK 🙇‍♀🏳‍🌈🌈
love it!
TikTok coming
I love her!!! My new jam song♥️
This has become my new anthem, reminding myself that I will dance again. Have had to take a break to work on getting my heart back to the condition where it can handle it.
Badass. Great tune!! Missed you!
Truly a Gem in a world full of moissanite's.  She continually brings ppl together with her music, her songwriting, her videos, she's the ultimate entertainer.  Always surprises her fans with her songs and the messages they contain.  Definitely my Choice in the entertainment industry.  She is also an actor, a winemaker, a momma, wife, friend to about everyone and all around good person.  RAD!
Aaah my PINK
Pink is so damn fine!❤️ She’s the total package, she’s beautiful, a great singer, a great dancer, a totally hot body🔥and she’s a lady that’s incredibly intelligent! Not to mention she’s a great mom😊!
My new cardio dance song,Pink is Queen
awesome love it and cool 😍😍😘😘🌹🌹❤❤
❤️🎶P!NK🎶❤️
just... thanks <3 love from norway <3
I'm sorry but this song sounds like if AI made a pop song. Go listen to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Santana Sublime. Tell me how much more soul there is
what a fuckin legend.  Pink...she always puts me in a good mood, and a vibe in my step.
I absolutely love this woman so much!!!! She is the living embodiment of fun. Please don't ever stop!!! 🥰😍
Lol song kinda wack. And she makes good music
Like almost all advance singles, a fairly conventional theme, the kind that doesn't leave a trace. But it's always nice to hear something new from P!nk.
One of the  best SONGS ever!!!  Makes me happy when I feel a bit down. I use to go out dancing all of the time and as I get older I don't as much. Now I just want to dance, even if it's just in my kitchen...
Thank you So much Power Lady.
Pink never disappoints. She is a STAR ❤
❤❤❤
In a world of chaos, confusion, and trajedy u can consistently always count on Pink to pull u into light ☀️✨ ❤
hi pink
Gross!  Just hang it up.
This song is soooo much better with the video. The video really brings out the fun vibe
I love Pink....Thanks for Mentioning Nippy
My mum likes this song and I so good I think it's good !!!!
I've always loved P!nk and I'll always love her.
As a bartender, and GM at the same time, this gets me driving so much, well all your songs. I'm exhausted in bed and kid you not, this song is on repeat Would be amazing just to have a couple of shots with her If you're ever in NYC 😜
I love you P!nk
Smiled the whole video! THNX Pink💕💙🧡💙
She is a world heritage at this point 🥺❤️
Voice super fiozofi shit
Instant mood changer 💃🏻🕺🏻
P!nk always makes me happy
I grew up with her music and she is still going hard!!    Legend!! 🔥
I like her for making this classic songs ❤
🙂🙃🙂🙃🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🔆👏👏👏👏
Love me some Pink ! That llama tho !!!!!
Cringe. Pink is the equivalent of sentient mom jeans bought at target.
SO MUCH ENERGY, LOVE YOU!!!!!
Same old P!nk ❤🎉
Love PINK!!!!!!! one of my favorite artist
I really thought that the video towards the end, when the lights went out, was to dark. Other than that, it was a great video 😘!
Just had an incredible workout dancing to P!nk's "Never Gonna Not Dance Again!"
Vaya decepción de todo lo que tienes
OMG! Love it! Another hit from Pink!
My only issue about this is the fact that I couldn’t see what was going on. I know they were dancing but I had trouble seeing it with the blue lights and decoration that fell down.
This gives me Gloria Estafan vibes.
Exactly!!! Music and Dance were my first loves and now i have my 10 year old to enjoy it with aswell. Never stop doing what makes you happy.
One thing I understand is that this is her job. If you don't like video...just play her music.
Highly relevant. Period. <3
Love it! Pink preaching it!
This woman!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a stupid song
I want my life to be long.. tx here
Pink is my hero she is awesome  and I'm 69 years young.
The Greatest Entertainer Ever…..Worldwide! Love you Pink! Ropes - 69 years young
I love love love love PINK and i love love love this song!!!!!! Wow i love it!!!!!!!
Whenever I want to hear some lesbo pop music, I always come to pink’s channel.
Dancer, composer, a spectacular voice.  A great woman, very complete in every way.  For me a music icon.  I love his music!
I’m so happy that pink continues to make more music for us to vibe too # TEAM PINK 🌸
i wouldnt wanna be anyone but me but if i had to choose a person to be like it would be you pink!
Amen Girl! Love to dance! And skate! Feels me with pure joy!
Wow. Love it .
Me like it.  A lot.
Geil Musica 🎶 Amore 💘
Ich liebe die Musica 🎶 von garze Herzen Amore 💘
Amore mio Musica 🎶 Amore 💘

Fucking yawn.
Pink makes me proud to be a woman. And I'm a man.
I am a huge fan of Pink!!! She never changes from being herself. It really does help me when I am going wtf is going on. I love this song!! Be yourself and recognize what is around you!!! I danced this entire song!!! Much love!!
I love this for her! PINK is back like she never left hunny💕
13 going on 45
І ми танцюємо в темряві! Пісня супер!!! 💛💙
from “I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight” to “For once I wouldn't start a fight” I LOVE HER 😭😭❤️❤️
Glad she being happy again!
Oh my lord this woman tho 🙌💖🫡🫶🏻
Pink thank you sincerely 🙏🏼  currently fighting 💪🏼 Breast Cancer and this song was divine timing 💕 SO Hoping to be able to see you on tour in Michigan 💕💕💕
Love this song, and love the skates! 🥰....Gives me massive Troll movie & JT vibes too though 😂
Brilliant track just brilliant
I have another song to blast in my car when I need a pick-me-up!
Amazing performance from one of the best. Keep shining and remind us of Living Life Fully!
I wish I could go back and tell a 16 year old me that it will all be okay. In 20 years Pink will still be killing it.  Every. Single. Time.
I really wanted to be able to see her live in Houston but the ticket prices are WAY out of my price range. So glad there’s YouTube.
Little call back to Get the party started.
I love that Pink has been rocking the baggy 1990s jeans SINCE the 1990s. What a badass rockstar.
Mac and Cheese sales go up now lol
❤️
❤
I am immunocompromised, and I totally miss going out dancing at the clubs and underground parties (since covid began, I have to be careful, I get sick easily). I have gone to a couple outdoor music events, those are always fun.... I cannot wait til it warms up, and outdoor parties are a thing again. In the meantime, gonna dance at home. ❤️💃
Once again Pink proves that you don't have to be an ass hole in order to be a real world leader.    You just need to leed by example.  Thank you  Alecia Beth Moore (aka) Pink.    For all that you have given us ... Respect! ✌️❤️🤘💯🤘⛵❤️
The rainbow flag 🏳️‍🌈😍
This song is write & produced by P!nk, Max Martin and Shellback. They are all legends in music. Like me if you know the latter two.
Let the music play till the end ❤️❤️ i am gona dance again xx
My best freind was at pink concert 16 years ago tomorrrow her 16 year death i was in hairdtessers today was nearly tearful i said thats pink so my bestest freind ever grace we will dance again always and forever when i see you again xx ❤️❤️
So much Love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Big love Hard ass bitch mom work alcoholic!!!!    Thank you💜✌️
I can not stop playing this song!   LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!
Pink's roller skating is a joy to behold while also instructing us all on the use of the double negative. She can truly do it all.
What a fun video. Makes me so happy 💗💗💗
I hope P!nk sees these comments. I'm struck by how much her music means to people of all ages and situations.  And the bond that her listeners have with each other.  It's very touching.
To think I used to look up the Pink, she's not even thinking about her daughter when she's representing all this evil # trash
Any way HE can sexualise and demoralise the youth he will 🤮 If I had children they wouldn't be listening to this rubbish Alcohol meat and let's walk a llama through wtf for?? The male energy is palpable and none of you can see it 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
She looks incredible... Love this look on her
Pink is the best yeah yeah yeah yeah
I LOVE IT!AMAZING JOB!you have the most,incredible job and career.I love u!💋
My bish is back. I’ve loved this woman since she first hit the scene. P!nk for president
Diva pop fazendo a farofa que amamos!!!!
This woman! I am so proud to be from Philly! 'Nuff said!
Pure talent I can't even recall a song not liked. Absolutely love Pink 💖
Echt einfach Super 💗💗💗
I'm living! Loving the jam P!nk ❤️
She has the midis touch!!!!
I sooo love this song. ❤️
ЛЕНКА не хочу в торговий центр половина старого завоза або свсе яскраве вже дратує або вишиванки і півцентра таких тазів тьоть які ніби заблукали після базару в хмельницкому мішку і щей туалети закриваете і кафешка в суперм аркетві заставленна товаром сидиш ніби дібіл серед баночок скляночок і через тебе тачки кошики ідуть .....точно кафешка яка гарна спокійна  стилізація стіниивелика є мясна котлетка салат з майонезом...чи чай взяти зелений аппельсинку піроженку... все таки афігенно купляти речі без батьків і подруг просто кайф
damn.. look at this woman <3 love to see her grown up but still P!nk it self

P! Nk has Been my absolute favorite artist through the years she is the epitome of Genuine & staying True to oneself, she's Simply Bada**! Every time I watch one of her video's or listen to one of her song's I go from depressed to Joyful!  Every single one of her song's has been a hit ! If I could be anyone, sing like anyone, look like anyone, She's it!  P!nk is & always has been My American Idol. 😘 Her  "I don't care what you think"  attitude is what sets her apart from everyone else not to mention she can sing upside down while flying above the crowds! She's an Amazing Athlete!  Her music & attitude makes me Happy!!!   Love you P!nk!  💗💗💗💗
I am so in love with this masterpiece, song, visual was so perfect. Another gem by P!NK ❤️ We needed this
Ela nunca decepciona. E confesso que me emocionou. Que possamos sempre dançar e se encantar pela vida
If you could see this smile on my face right now .... Roller skating is a huge passion of mine and you P!nk are my all time favorite artist ... Seeing you with skates on just made my day!!! 🛼😍😁🧡🛼
🥰🥰🤩🤩
:)Bravoooo!
PINK ROCKING MOXI ROLLER SKATES!!!! So proud and an honor!!!💖
Can't wait for her new album. Avri Lavigne already gave me 'Love Sux' and soon a deluxe version, Adele gave me '30' and now I need P!nk, Katy Perry and Rihanna to drop their damn new albums already.
❤️❤️
YESSSSSS!!  See you again next year.  With Pat Benetar.  BOSTON YEAHYAAAA!!!

I love PinK soo much and this song reminds me to always dance.....dance to life forever...
Video concept looks like niki's summer time music video😌
Dancing keeps my soul alive - I haven't been able to for a while as I am currently at the beginning of 10 weeks of aggressive treatments for Chronic Lyme Disease in Mexico. Woke up today so exhausted and weak, put this song on and it made me SO determined to beat this and dance my butt off again soon!  Thank you for this medicine. 💫💞 Love&Light to all.
She’s always slaying
Elle fait de la pop maintenant pink.... J'aime pas du tout, je préférais les influences rock de ses anciennes chanson. Je préférais sa mélancolie même si je suis heureuse pour elle qu'elle soit enfin bien dans sa peau mais bon l'ancienne pink me manque tout de même
I love you girl you rock
I love the part with the pride flag
Just because I can’t dance as good as I used to due to CRPS, the highest ranked chronic pain but I’m still going to dance through the pain.
Love the song..
Wish she collaborated with Britney with this song 😀
thanks for  lovelyhappy tune <3
How could an artist be so perfect and complete????! Really wanna see her on Jimmy! Actually I'd like seeing her on Ellen singing this song... but......! Brazil loves you Pink!
But u are dancing though bruhhh
Love this song, just a feel-good happy song! 3:38 sounds so similar to the ending of Band Aid 20 - Do They know It's Christmas Time :D  love it!
WOW PINK, This is how you do it!!! What a f*cking cool bitch... love that sound and love that video!!!❤😍🥰👍
Queen amooo Yees ❤😍🎶🎶

Ok, everyone has forgot to mention how fun life is, and how stunning she looks! Inspiring me to get off my butt too! Very fun, I love it!!!
God she is soooooo hottttttt 😍
This is why I still love Pink since I was little
They would had to have fun doing this music video. Pink never fails to bring out the music.
There's a song that ask u. what will u do before Jesus. I will Dance.
Saudades da Pink que fazia clipes icônicos com músicas boas...
I need to buy this cd I am old school like this when is the album due ???????😃
I was so happy to hear this song. Everything else is boring or depressing. Pink knows how's to have fun. See you don't need to be 20 to have fun fun fun.....
HI I LOVE IT GOOD JOB
00:53 Cool!
this song is number one
Such bad example for young girls out there...
Pink always make great songs like it ❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
This music video and song is what everyone needed. Her voice is amazing and her soul is pure
The exact opposite of George Michael
I😅
I’ve always like you pink because of my teacher I had a crush on her in English
Fucking love this…totally awesome want to put on my roller skates and dance away ❤😊
Amo todo lo que haces. 🤩😘😘😘😘 realmente una estrella.
Never disappoints super fff rock star ⭐️ pink !!!!!!! Love you always and forever 😊 thanks for the joy 🥲
💕💕💕💕💕 love it
Can't Get Enough for the next song pink smashed it out by the building
I love the song and vid
Cadê os brasileiros  que estão  ouvindo a  música  da cantora PINK??? FERIADO FELIZ E ABENÇOADO  PARA TODOS !!!
Quick!...Somebody call the cops! Someone stole Alecia and replaced her with something that looks shockingly-great but isn't "PINK"!.... With the exception of the sarcastic "power-outage"!
Bad day at work folks crank this up full bore and your bad day will fade into nothing
Seriously, you need to be able to dance first before you can stop and you most definitely are not a dancer, complete rubbish....
Spectacular!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤PINk rules!!!! Been a fan for a looonnng time! She keeps evolving as an artist and I am continually blown away by her talent! Werk mama!
nunca defrauda esta artista!!maravillosa !!!contagia alegria
GOOD BLESS PINK ! ! !
Yeah Sabrina ! Cute  Cute  Cute  Yeah !
dope video!
P!nk ❤ ♥️ ❤
Pink does'nt give a fuck what other people say she's like "I don't give a fuck what you say i know i'm cool"she will be here no mater what people say.
❤️❤️❤️
Sounds  a little like Justin timberlake's " Can't stop the feeling"
LOVE you... :-))) ...
pink is an icon untill now her music still suits to this new gen of music shes so amazing.....
The best it really make me feel it !!
Pink is Pink 😍
Is there nothing this lady cannot do? Raging she is not gigging in Ireland.
OI
She's is back.
I love you pink we love you from Philippines
Amazing as always
2:07 parece a Ismeio @ismeiow
Love P!nk. I make this my every Morning song😊😊
Hand Hugz.....hahaha......¿Rosa¿
I'm always going to love listening to Pink and watching her dance, but hey, Sarah Bareilles already did this video!
LOVE the news about the AMA's tribute to OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN with Pink.  💗 #PINKLADIESFOREVER
Max Martin + Pink = Happy ears
I have always loved to dance but now I’m 78 with Parkinson’s and my spine has twisted into S shapes and moving again. Standing up is hard but I jiggle when I hear music and this song reminds me of who I used to be. My husband who was killed in an accident 18 years was my life and anchor, used to call him his dancing Queen and I miss him everyday. Thank goodness there is still music and dancing P.s. I used someone eldest laptop I’m not Trev - I’m Eleanor!
I don’t know how I feel about this. Working with Max Martin at this stage in her career seems a little uninspired and unoriginal. Like this could be from the soundtrack of a Trolls movie sequel sung by anybody. And the energy overall is a tad cringe. I don’t like how the lyrics hinge on the double negative in the chorus either, it’s unpleasant. Overall a five out of ten.
Fantastic, brilliant magnificent. As always pink Is no1, could see Bruno mars singing this also.
I sing this song in the car lol
That was a fun video. Also, I will add that if Pink started dancing in front of me,  idc what I'm eating it's on the floor and I'm dancing back
❤️❤️❤️
sweet
Love the melody and positive vibe BUT did you say take away...um...my dog, pink?  Thats lie down and die time for me....  Now you gotta make a Pupper  Remix titled "Never going to not puppo again"
I thought I liked you, Pink!  But you just used the “F” word in your song, plus you show too much, if you know what I mean!!!  Heavenly Father & Jesus Christ would not like you to talk like that or dress like that also!!!  Have you found them in your life?!?!  They love you!!!  Love, Gay Michaelis  ❤👍🙏✋😇💚🌺🥰💕❤️‍🩹😁💗🐶💘💙💞🐱💖💝
Love t!   I've always loved Pink!   Love everything about her!  This is just another great song to add to my playlist!
PLEASE COME BACK TO ORLANDO 4 Carnival tour!!!  OMG!!!  PLEASE
Osea hacer videos en el súper ahora es la moda ? #shaki #pink
This film clip gives me the same vibes as Galantis's Peanut Butter Jelly song... same kind of theme....
Glad to see pink back
My 76 y/o partner of 28 years just discovered Pink via TV without seeing the video. He says wow she has a good voice!! I really like this song 🤩 Is she still alive???? At this point I lost it...🤣🤣🤣🤣😎😎🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉🎉
TODAY?
Definitely  help Me through my teenage years I love you
I love so much this song. Pink you are amazing !!!
i love how shes always so unique
so yummy.  keep on dancing !
Pleaseeeee come to Amsterdam Ziggo Dome. Loveeee  the new number
Essa música me emocionou... eu sempre quis todas as pessoas juntas e felizes, mas elas nunca souberam aproveitar isto... Ficaram em seus próprios limbos me julgando e tentando me colocar pra baixo. Obrigada por nos dizer que não devemos nos deixar parar, P!nk, amo você!!
this song is AMAZING!!!!! i really needed this
😍🥰🥰🥰🤩😘
Didn't realise she was actually shaped like this 😥😥
S2
Fun song🤗
Jak zwykle świetnie uwielbiam ją 😘😘😘
I love that Pink is normalizing swinging with the Upside-Down Pineapples (in her shopping cart).
LA MEJOR, SALUDOS DESDE ECUADOR 🇪🇨 ❤️🎼
F**ckin' Perfect! This music is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
loooooooooooooooooooooooove it <3
Danke für das lustige Lied, auch ein Dank an alle Verkäufer und Verkäuferinnen ❤️
Love this!
Na capa do vídeo pensei que ela tava fazendo o L kkkk
Never gonna not dance again doesn't make sense.
I can't believe she is going on tour with Brandi Carlile and Pat Benatar. Finally get to take our Granddaughter and I'm loosing my mind right now! Soooo excited!!!!
I love you!!!
Goo P!NK❤
Which Whitney Houston song Pink???? 🎵
winning
We all needed this in our life!! Thank you!! 🎶💃🏻
Damn, I love PINK!!!!!
This video is so cute, especially the bald skater. Yo Pink killing those dance moves!!!!!!
Amore 💘 Musica Tolle Super video Geil
Super grazie Musica 🎶 Amore 💘
Geil Musica 🎶 Amore mio
Amore 💘 Musica 💘 🎶
Ich liebe pink, alles an ihr, mega song 🥰
I  LOVE you. Your music makes me sooo fucking happy.
bonjour
This song kind of sucks, but it’s still light years better than the general dross on the charts
thank you for this song -- we will dance on it - greetings from austria
WOWWW P¡! NK
Such a fun 🎵 song. Seen the behind the scenes and needed to see this video. It didn't disappoint 🙌
Her energy is unique and it brings happiness and joy to my life. It tells us that we need to enjoy our lives with good healthy and fun habits!  When she sings this verse, “the thing that makes us all so dumb” she is actually referring that we spend too much time on our phones missing the meaningful things in life. 💖
Wow what a make you feel good song just brilliant ❤
the pure energy of p!nk will never change, it will always be upbeat and uplifting<3
💜💜💜 Love from T.O 🇨🇦

Now its time TO DANCE AGAIN!! 🤩🥰💃💃 Ps its going to be My Ringtone 🎶💃😂🎵 💋💋 Love and light from Scotland 💋💖 Ps im 52 act 22!! 😂😂💃💃💃 💕💕😍
This actually made me cry. It reminded me of my mom, who passed away a year ago on November 26th. She love Pink a lot and even got to go to one of her concerts not long before her passing. This song reminded me so much of her because I remember her love of dancing, and her dancing to some songs while in the car or shopping at the store with me. I love this song I really do. I know she would have loved this song very much and I know I would have sent her this song immediately.
MARAVILHOSA!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Israel jerusalem
😘, you don't care 😋👍
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!
Its stupid
I really want that pink jacket.  Plz start selling copies in ur shop 😍
Can someone tell me please which brand of shoes is she using ?
Alguien me puede decir que marca de zapatillas son las que usa?
This song put a big smile on my face 😊
This song is amazing and the perfect song to such a shitty situation (covid)
Me recuerda una canción feliz de Justin timberlake

Love Pink, simply love her!
Дорогая Алеся! Надеюсь, кто-то переведет тебе это: ты лучше всех и я надеюсь увидеть тебя с концертами в Беларуси! Потому что имя тебе Свобода и Радость! Вы так нужны нам тут! И имя Алиша это по-белорусски Алеся ;) wish you are here!
she is the moment.

Jak  zwykle bezbłędna  i pozytywnie zakręcona. Uwielbiam  cię  PINK.  Do zobaczenia w  Warszawie ❤❤❤❤
Hello, this is a great song!!! I love love Pink. Greetings from Ecuador!  Here Team Mar Rendón, Let´s listen her song Knock on another door and Ren Kai Shorty Remix,  wonderful song in Chinesse, English and Spanish.
Absolutely great song and video, but why does it look streched in height like they did with Kelly Clarkson's videos in the 2000s?
I love it that Pink can sing any type of song.  She can be a little punk rock, sing show tunes and more.  I loved this song the moment I heard it on the radio.  It shows what she loves to do.  This song makes me feel happy😊.
Autêntica ❤️
Never get tired to watch this masterpiece ❤ and i Also watch her old videos, She is the one And only queen ❤
It's official. Every music video with a food truck is the best. 🥰
Perfect ❤ please come to Brazil

♡Thank you Queen♡
A bop  Pink just always serves
The pit is about to feast is the message im getting 🤔 between this and the 10:35 video right underneath this. I'd say we're what 7 years from 113 and his army. Guess what though yal gona loose in the end!
PInk can't sing a bad song!!! You 🎸 rock!!!!💖💕💕💖
Yay yay yay love me some Pink!!!
November 13, 2022. I'm still here
PINK UP MY LIFE! LOVE IT!
Seriously cannot wait to see  the legend that is P!nk when she tours the UK next year. Always been a fan and always wanted to see her live!! ICON!! X
Love it's my theme song for life!
У нас свет так быстро после блэкаута не включается
The title and vibe of this song make me so emotional . I grew up loving dance and taking dance classes till I graduated highschool . After that I wasn’t taking regular classes , my depression was getting more out of control and I developed a binge eating disorder . I was ashamed of my body and still often feel like I’m too embarrassed to burst into dancing . When I was younger I’d dance to the music in grocery stores without Shame. Now I feel embarrassed of how I look after seeing myself on video damcing . But when a good song plays on Fremont st, there are times I can throw off the shame and just dance like I’m 16 again . I never wanna not dance .
Such an uplifting song , this video made me love this song more 😊
To my spotify list RIGHT NOW 📲🎊🎊

Love your lifestyle. Live a life you want. Love you from Viet Nam. 🥰🥰🥰
😍👏💜
♡
🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽
That made me smile. P!NK always crushing it 😍
Love all of your songs Pink... The long wait is over!!! Never gonna dance again...
Love it!!!!!
Brilliant !!
I love this video. It's not a critique on generations or cliques. Instead, it's saying that everyone has accepted a sadder, more mellow life. P!nk won't accept that and will keep on being herself no matter how times change!
Absolutely love it as always ❤️ xx
Girl, don't throw that hip out.   Lol
Love this...an upbeat Feel good song!
I will ! The good Lord is so good to me,  I will continue to live the life he gives me. High and definitely over coming the lows! Loving myself!  Life challenges are so difficult! Yet he gives us breath! So why not live? Make the best of it each human can! Good luck on your journey!
She looks so good!! But not feeling the song very generic. Wish she would do a lil album like her first 2 albums
Her energy is contagious and she’s just so lively! She always has good vibes and good messages.
I missed P!nk
It’s the fact she’s still here and making it look GOODT
I love P!nk! She is beautiful and awesome! ❤ She is such a freakin' ass genius! She really knows how to write great songs! 👍👍❤
I love eavey minute of  it I love  it  pink  is true  singer
I love how she grabbed a bunch of pride flags🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!
I can't really sing well but I can dance lol
Love pink. ❤️
this song is so goooooooooooooooood
<3<3<3<3<3
Pink is badass, but this song didn’t match her coolness. I see this song for more of a up-and-coming teen girl. 🤷🏽‍♂️
I’m 44 and I grew up on pink when she was just starting out way back in the day
I love to see singer pink in non-celebrity places like the grocery store
I’ve been in love with P!nk for over half my life 😍 I remember getting her first album in middle school ❤️‍🔥 she’s still got it 🗣👏🏾💃🏽
After such a bad year this is the kind of song I need. I want to go to Costco and put on some rollerskates and jam to some Whitney Houston 80s jam. #Pink
Mad respect for this lady. Has always done her own thing, never imitated anyone musically or style wise. When you are confident in your skills you don't have to worry about what others are doing.! Her vids never disappoint!!!
💗💕👑💕💗
Hermoso !!!
Thanks P!nk
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Queen
P!nk i love you! You're magic! *.*
Tears streaming down my face. Beautiful song! We needed this & we need you! I suffered work injury back in January & I'm still working on getting stronger. I want to give up sometimes because of the pain. Yes, we will dance again! Ps. I also have a pair of leopard print roller skates 🙏🏻❤
I have a 2 year old daughter. Shes as beautiful as you which is hard to match. Me and her mom are seperate but get along. Id love nothing more than give her a chance to be on your level. The world deserves her. She can help.
I've loved your music and your personality in general 🏳️‍🌈❤️‍🩹🙌💃
This generic pop anthem feels like a Max Martin throwaway project
Yas P!nk! Wake up! There's so much to celebrate. We made it through! <3
🏳️‍🌈❤️
I really love this song. The last couple of years has been rough, and I don't really smile anymore, but this song, really makes me happy and makes me feel like i wanna start living my life again for good. Thank you. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
🎉P🎉!🎉N🎉K🎉
I've always loved Pink since I was a kid. She truly has a beautiful soul, voice, spirit. Every singe song of hers is truly unique and powerful.
Great song!
Love you!  Love this!!! So fun!  Thank you!!!
This video and song are both awesome!!  I love seeing Pink on roller skates 🛼❤.
I love you with all my heart P!nk 😭

Thanks for the funky upbeat fun song Pink! Waiting to see you live next year 🙂.
It's now over 2 decades and this rocker still hasn't stopped putting out some really amazing songs she has to be one of the best female artist that's out there today.
A levada dessa música  parece as musicas do álbum  Alive da Jessie j

that poor girl in those jelly shoes. PAIN.
essa mulher não erra nunca ❤️
Love this song my favorite artist  back at it again ❤️❤️ keep it up Girl………
Pink. I love your music and I love what you're about. I struggle with depression and anxiety your music always gives me the lift I need.🥰
Need to go grocery store without money while playing this song...
The best!!!
Honestly really like this! And her jeans tho so sick🔥
Pink’s voice is amazing, she is gorgeous, her rebellious nature is fantastic, but sad to say Pink’s gone woke so I won’t be watching her anymore. Sad day for me and it’s just my opinion.
Pink and Adam Sandler always play """losers"""" (even though they really are not) but I would love to see them do something together
Where is the how to dance this at? Not gonna learn now but want to when I'm better
Love this so much 🥳🎉🎊❤️
Full on garbage
OMG. I love her haircut. It's so cute! Great song! P!nk never disappoints.
Music for middle age mums
❤ From 🇧🇷 Brazil 🌈💕🎈⭐️😻☀️
💯 Exactly que preciosa!!
She really knocked it out of the park with this one, it's so good
J'adore !!!
Don't get me wrong.... I love, love, LOVE! P!nk... Have seen her six times, and will see her whenever she comes around on tour.  But Gelantis' "Peanut Butter Jelly" was a better supermarket video ;-)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jBDnYE1WjI
Mmm buen tema but esperaba otra cosa 🙄 is Pink.
This song resonates with me, what a year this year has been, big changes, endings, and new beginnings ❤🥰😘😍💕💜💋
Awesome ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
❤❤❤❤❤

I just emphasize with her energy so much!!! We love you!!! 🦋❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
I was born too never stop moving!! Love dancing ❤
I love you Pink
This is such a feel good song,  ive been a fan of pink since the I'm not dead album ive got every album since then plus i bought the missundaztood album a few years ago. 🥰  She has never released a bad song so talented
Pyi
I was crying cause I don’t have a mom and dad but this song made me happy and I realized I’ve already wasted enough time not being happy about my situation. I’m truly blessed.
Wow!~~~~welcome back P!nk😍😍😍😍👍👍👍
Guess pink stopped being vegan long ago huh?
Pink is back! This video gives me the feel good vibes of the 2000s. What I take from this video is to embrace your inner weirdo. Never conform!
I won't ever forget the first time I heard her on the radio. She wasn't just an instant hit with me, pretty much everyone was listening and if they weren't, she was everywhere anyway!! I bought her first CD for $13.97 + tax. I still listen to it all the time.
The lagend wake up in the sleep
I remember when she made good music, that was like 15+ years ago now 😂
FINALLY!! I've been waiting for P!nk to excite me again! Well done
It was good til she threw in a rainbow flag!! how can she support a wrong lifestyle??? ugh now I have to not listen to her songs.
🙏❤🎶😍
i just love her.
I used p!nk as an example of a leader for university, she’s able to empower yet more people through her music it’s wonderful to see
And thus I talk too much
It's just so beautiful your work... You don't? I tried sometimes to do simulator so we'll see
Super boring song.
Sometimes I work a little bit on that and then I realize this only Beauty... That you do
I would love so much a little bit
It would ever what type tell you that you are gorgeous? I'm just asking
P

Go my roller skater girl your a really good roller skater even in the shops wow!
Momm iloveyou!!
오우, 전과는 좀 다른 새로움 그러나 역쉬 목소린 여전하군
I want an acoustic version so bad Omgggg
Kids will watch that video and that is how you display yourself to them? Doesn’t come as a surprise coming from a satanic democrat
Pink has always been the embodiment of "I know I'm cool, I don't give a fuck, fuck you, you wish you were this cool" for over 20 years and still going just as hard.
I am sitting here with tears running down my face. I needed this so much! My husband died 7 months ago and I'm about to move to assisted living. I love this song and you!!! Thanks more than you could know.
Worst songs in history
I'm so happy you included the pride flags. Love an ally
When the budget die all be blue
I just love you so much!! ❤️
i guess disco's the biscuits of pop music... never gets old!
La La Llama 3:20
I love her music! I’m 55 years old with RA and would love her hairstyle. I always dance when I’m by myself. It’s therapeutic and keeps you going. Plus it puts me in a great mood. Love ya Pink.
Joy!
😂
This gives coming out of lockdown vibes. The positive vision we all need
Eu amooo vc ♥️
Ні пісня, ні відео не сподобалися. І якщо з відео все зрозуміло, бо так часто трапляється, то стосовно пісні - шкода.
A perfect post-pandemic anthem
❤❤🎼🎼🎼❤❤
Lay it down girl yummy
Absorbing this because is what I need 👏❤️
Love YOU and this new song!!  Thanks for being YOU💗💓💖
Kt supermarket pun jadi laaa 😆
whose here in 2023
This song made me smile for the first time in a while… left the love of my life a year ago now and I’ve regretted it since… then my mom died a couple months ago and life just seems like it’s getting sadder and never better…
Si alguien me dijera que el mundo se acabaría esta noche Podrías tomar todo lo que tengo por una vez, no comenzaría una pelea Podrías tener mi licor, tomar mi cena, tomar mi diversión Mi pastel de cumpleaños, mi alma, mi perro, tomar todo lo que amo  Pero, oh, una cosa que nunca voy a hacer Es tirar mis zapatos de baile y Oh, señor, no me pruebes, de verdad, no esta noche Me acostaré y moriré, gritaré y Lloraré Ya hemos perdido suficiente tiempo  Nunca dejaré de bailar de nuevo Nunca dejaré de bailar de nuevo Oh, solo quiero hacer estallar y bloquear mis discos Ahí va toda mi ropa Nunca dejaré de bailar de nuevo ( Oh) Ddd-baile voy a bailar, bruh Ddd-baile Voy a bailar  Quiero que mi vida sea una canción de Whitney Houston (Quiero bailar) Tengo toda la buena suerte y cero mierdas, no me importa si pertenezco, no Si pudiera matar lo que nos hace todo tan tonto nunca nos volvemos jóvenes, así que me voy a divertir mucho  porque, oh, una cosa que nunca voy a hacer es tirar mis zapatos de baile y oh, señor, no me pruebes, de verdad, no esta noche Me acostaré y moriré, gritaré y lloraré Sé que estoy comenzando una pelea  Nunca dejaré de bailar nunca más Nunca dejaré de bailar otra vez Oh, solo quiero explotar y bloquear mis registros Ahí va toda mi ropa Nunca no voy a bailar de nuevo (Oh) Ddd-dance voy a bailar, bruh Ddd-dance voy a bailar, sí, ddd-dance  Me acostaré y moriré, gritaré y lloraré Sabes que estoy comenzando una pelea (pelea ) Me acostaré y moriré, gritaré y lloraré Ya hemos perdido suficiente tiempo Ya hemos perdido suficiente tiempo  Nunca dejaré de bailar de nuevo Nunca dejaré de bailar de nuevo Oh, solo quiero explotar y bloquear mis discos Ahí va toda mi ropa Nunca no voy a bailar de nuevo (Oh) Ddd -baila voy a bailar, hermano Ddd-baila No voy a bailar, así que deja que la música suene hasta el final..
Thank you! We needed this.
love u pink
Only Pink can make a fantastic song called "I'm Never Gonna Not Dance Again". Fun video too!
I just wanted to say I have always loved you pink, omg I love your bed song I find myself watching this video 10 times a day lol, I just love it, it's such a fun song and very uplifting, I sing it all day too I can't seem to not keep singing to it, thank you pink I can't wait for your album to come out, and give willow and jamo a big hug for me I just adore your babies, sending y'all all my love. WYNNE from Louisiana
Pink is my 'spirit animal',  my world., and of course  INCREDIBLY AMAZING!!! she always showed/taught us, Always Be Yourself, and blaze your own path in this (more often then not) #CrazyWorld , and #NeverChange for Anyone, or Anything. Especially the downers'/haters' in this world.  #PinkIsLife  ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 #AlwaysAwesome 😘
Música e videoclipe perfeitos 😍
Amazing! ...not only is it always a pleasure to listen to Pink's songs and spectacular voice, each video has a mix of magic and fun and "absurd mood" that makes it unique. I love this Artist !!!😍🥰😍🥰😍❤❤❤❤❤❤‍🔥
💜✨🙌
Wow she never disappoint us everytime she do comeback 🍒
I love it ❤️😍
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Hmmm pink and blue...transgender colors...is pink trying to tell us something?
More Kylie than Pink 😂
:)
Essa mulher é maravilhosa xD
This is so great!
this is so good
I micd u grl wooo😍
I  MISS THIS PUNK QUEN
always love the vibe pink gave us
Great song love.
Yo I heard this song on the radio that's why I'm searching it I did not know it was PINK... I ain't even attracted to her looks but I'd fucking marry this woman...and I hope my woman don't se this comment 😂🤣.
No te voy a puto amar, joder ❤🔥
See!!!  This is why I adore her...she makes everything so bloody fun!
Love this song. Such a happy song.❤
Pinks music sucks and sounds the same with those mediocre vocals.The people only like it because it gets played a million times on the radio and it sticks in their minds.
Harley Quinn vibes
te amooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo mucho
Of course she picks up pride flags
Te amo 💖
Great! ❤❤❤
Me encantó
A energia surreal que essa mulher emana é incrível. Da pra sentir daqui a alegria dessa música e o poder que ela tem de transformar com essa voz perfeita. P!NK, você não existe ❤❤❤
Oooh look at P!nk giving us that good energy!!
OMG 💛, feeling every cell of my entire body. Thank you so much! Didn't know that i needed that so much. What a wave of endorphines 💔💚💛👌. Love to your wonderful soul. Keep on going. I'm such a fan for years. Your my absolut favorite role Model 💚
A video of joy, happiness, catarctic (is there such a word?), we needed that so much!!
I remember going to school listening to her songs, giving me courage and heart to go through everything that I had. And now more than 10 years later, I can still fall in love with all of her songs once again! She gives me so my life, I'm so very thankful to her!
♥️👍💃👍🕺👍🥳👍♥️ But, wait a moment... There was an 🦙? Really? 😂🤣😍
When you don't know how to dance, DON'T. She looks stupid and ridiculous. Everything ain't for everybody.
I fell in love with P!NK's music when I was very young, and her music opened my eyes to expressing emotion through music. Pink is an inspiration as an artist, mother and wife, and continues to create beautiful, emotional, and unique pieces of art that I hope will last and inspire many many generations after I've left this planet. Thank you Pink for putting another smile on my face.
Not the same catchy fun music I remember from back in the day I'm sorry
Can you please release consistently again! We need your music more than ever — P!NK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Eu amei a sua Nova musica,  sempre muito inspiradora e uma voz incrível...sou seu fã. Beijos
BRAVO ! that's exactly what we all really need right now: & Pink did it ... obviously (I will add): FUN FUN FUN DANCE DANCE DANCE !!!  Unique Pink. Message clearly, and "cleverly" (I am French, sorry but U will understand me for the rhyme with clearly LOL) delivered. In your own way (which doesn't change): I missed it, but you did it again. So "we're good" again (I love that american expression : we're good ? : we're good). THANKS A LOT !!! as I am dancing on my chair now : merci beaucoup Pink
This official video is now my official got-to video... soon to be 76 and still dancing like I did before I was in school. I had loved to dance so much that my folks got me a 45 record player for the rec room so I could dance whenever I wanted. Was a white-booted go-go girl in college. Listen to the local pop/rock station every day when I'm painting and will drop my brush and dance when whatever I can dance to comes on. I LOVE THIS!
Welcome back P!k
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
I've listened Pink since i was a teen. Now i'm 37 with a child. Feels like i've grown up with her. Amazing artist.
Well, it's a nice ear candy in disco flava. Thank you, P!nk! 🤩
Why was the whole bit with u in the fizzy hair and puff dress cut??? Is there a whole load missing
Halsey has nothing on P!NK
I'm 44 and have loved pink since she started, her music explains a lot of my life she's such a Inspiration to being true to yourself and loving yourself and never give up I just love her so much ❤️❤️❤️
This made me smile and cry!!! I needed this
Why is my only question about the video, "How much did Instacart pay to have their logo in the video?"
❤️🎶❤️🎶❤️
Eu amei ✨
❣️❤️👏👏👏👏 Desdé España 😍😘
Je t'aime 😘🤩😍
I'm getting a "Can't stop the feeling" vibe <3
This lifts me up thanks pink forever a fan from 1998 when I was 9 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I have stopped dancing due to physical problems, but seeing this ha truly inspired me to get back to it.  I also have skates I bought a couple years ago and am dying to get back on.  As a teen I skated every weekend at a local rink. Thanks for the inspiration!!!!  Keep doing what you do!
Queen
Um dos melhores shows que eu presenciei no Rock in Rio <3
Way better than 95% of what's on the radio, but they'll ignore it.
FOA...que lindo amiga
My queen is back❤❤❤❤❤
Toujours au top. Je t'adore.🥰
The avatar was back 😎🥰
❤️❤️❤️😍🔥
She did it again. I love it!
i am sorry but this is so .... plastic... like Paris Hilton ....
Ok never...but in your video you dancing.......🤔
I miss angry pink to be honest. I love her comedic side but I miss the angsty songs she used to make
Another amazing song, such a tune to cheer anyone up it certainly has me
Alors on Dance a la sauce américaine….POP POP POP du coup . Ceci dit, love p!nk anyway. ❤
Thank you for this song Pink ❤️
Me as a skater noticing the Moxi Malibu barbie rollerskates 😍
I LOVE PINK!!!
Love it 😍
porque ela ta usando a calba de shopping do patolino no final?
Wow, this is bad.  How did we go from Missunderstood to this generic pop?
Watched it last night with my mom and had to come back as always she never disappoints the song is so so good!
OMG this is so nice 🥰
🤩😘
0:55  I love this choreography! ❤🕺
A VIBE DESSA MÚSICA!!
Exactly what I needed to go on! Thank you ❤️! Always such an inspiration!💪
I thought this was going to be a cover for the song that say " my guilty feet ain't got no rhythm" but I wasn't terribly disappointed. I wonder if people really do enjoy dancing this much? Or if having an audience is a factor. Either way I thought the song was upbeat I just don't really have a lot of passion for dancing. I just kinda psyched myself up to hear how she would have covered the classic. And now we may never know.
Pink is Pink ❤❤❤
Love, love Pink
This is a masterpiece
She's becoming one of those people that dont age. Tell us your secret!
I’m going to hell for this comment but been a mom has turned pink into Disney on acid . Not her best tune to be fair 😮 still she’s a goddess and I still love her
Glad to see something fun and upbeat to dance too
Living legend 🎉
Why am I crying? I'm currently in the midst of maybe the darkest time of my life and sheesh P!nk I just love you so much!
It was amazing! Keep it up woman!
Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone
🌟 Dear Spice Girls member Victoria Beckham.. listen to this lyric..  The one thing I'm never gonna do is throw away my dancing shoes.  The 👑 Spice Girls are legends and known for the  platform boots and all. They are always going to stay in fashion. Platform shoes and boots are the coolest shoes. Posh Spice at 99% didn't wear them and on the Drew Barrymore show she was asked what 90s fashion would she hope wouldn't come back and she said the shoes my other band members wore. Well minus Sporty. Lol no way the best group members wore them. Baby Spice, Scary Spice and Ginger Spice. ❤
Been P!nk die hard fan since ages, now I'm 42yrs old & yet ur still 🤘Lotsa 💕From The Land of Borneo Sarawak 🇲🇾❌⭕❌⭕
Perfeito
I love you P!NK 💖💖💖💖
So cute..im so happy.

I love alecia Moore
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG!!!!!!
I absolutely love love love this song ...I am In  my 50's and have cancer...but I still dance around my apartment to groovy music...like I was still in my teens...thank you Pink....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💃

F!!!!!!  Amazing ❤xx
One like button is just not enough on this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Such an inspiration! Now I wanna pull out my skates at 40 yrs of age and hit up the rink! 😘
I was just thinking  the other day-"what the fuck's hapening with Pink?"Haven't heard anything from her in months & what do we get? Fantastic!!.
💖
Maravilhosa ❤️
I'm mostly a metalhead, but P!nk will always have a place in my heart!
YES! Bring BACK ROLLER-SKATES! Saturday @ the rink with the DJ bringing the O-SO-FRESH TUNES…. Now THAT is a HOT TICKET 🎉  GROCERY STORE DANCE PARTY is already a BI-WEEKLY SITUATION for me but I am so glad the rest of the world is catching up!🤣  NAILED IT PINK😍❤☝️
My birthday twin done did it again!!! ❤❤️🔥🔥🔥
I'm an actor and I applied to be the moody cashier girl she shakes! On Actors Access, the breakdown said the video was for "a well known pop / R&B artist." Thought for sure it would be Lizzo. Damn, if I had known it was P!nk, I would have written a Pullitzer Prize-winning cover letter! But I did get to write about this song for my music blogging job, so I guess I got to be a part of this single's success in some way haha. Loved P!nk ever since my mom used to blast her CDs in the car. Glad to see her back in the limelight! 😍💖
Least favorite Pink song. Not feeling this one 😏
My Queen will never disappoint, this is another masterpiece added to her playlist. P.S. She looks incredibly fit
This was refreshing. You go girl! Philly in the house!!!
I love her so much! My mama did too 🖤
The freer of spirits 😆🌻 P!nk ❤️❤️❤️
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚
PINK MAKES THE BEST MUSIC/ VIDEOS- LOVE IT !!! ❤️❤️❤️
Pink's music, music videos and art are always on point and refreshing 💖🥹🎉 I'M NEVER NOT GONNA NOT DANCE AGAIN!!!!!!!! 🎉
This video  made me reminisce her older videos and reflected that present day may look colorful but in reality it isn't, behind the bright vibrant colors that this generation portrays deep down it's sad and gloomy inside.
✨✨✨🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Pink! One of my queens with Gwen Stefani, Love her
Oh P!NK!!! <3 <3 <3
A legend ❤
Omg this was unexpected...I always loved Pink and her music...please do another pop r&b soul album one last time for the day 1 fans
This gonna be my favorite song now
Wow this is very good, better than I ever expected 👏😳
Beautiful Pink!!! 😍😍

Love you PINK 😍😍😍
👍🐝👯‍♀️👸🏽💃
Beautiful as always ❤
She is amazing !! 47 years old and I love love her❤.. I can’t wait till she tours again..
Oh Pink, Thank you!
Of the many things I have to be thankful for, my natural dislike for lame brain top 20 pop ear pollution, remains high on the list. I’m not sure how this video managed to get played within my eyesight and earshot, but it did. And I’m thankful. I guess I’ve just been taking for granted my appreciation for real artists for so long, I forgot trash like this was still out there. For any of you people who have been duped into mistaking what you’ve just seen here for talent, I suggest googling Tom Macdonald. ❤
Usando o patins Moxi 😍😍😍😍
No.1❤️
I love you pink. Let's visit MAR RENDON with #Knockonanotherdoor and Ren Kai #Shorty. Remix... Pink my idol.... Thanks waiting for your visit! !

New pink sucks
I love Pink... Let’s listen Mar Rendón  with #Knockontheanotherdoor and Renkai #Shorty Remix. My idol Pink since ever!
❤️❤️❤️
Old pink was good until she was fucked by carey
Alecia's flat aaaasssssssssssssss
Pink absorbed carey's semen
P!nk is still one of the best...Iconic and legendary!! She is one of my favorite Pop singer since 2000. Love that she still beings new to the table!!   #LoveP!nk!
Can't say I care for quite a lot of her newer stuff. However, I always appreciate her for being just who she is.
Wow! What a great song and video! You're going to single-handedly bring back the roller rinks from oblivion. And disco dancing. Can't sing the word "dance" in this song without raising one or both pointing index fingers.👆❤
This just made me happy listening to it. I'm glad Pink is still out there making fun dance music.
Cada ano essa mulher é mais maravilhosa! ☺️
Anyone else pick up on the upside down pineapples in her cart? 😂😂😂 🍍

How very p!nk 😍
P!nk has skillfully conveyed many tips to today's society, such as the issue of social media addiction, alcohol and drug addicts, support for vegetarians, bad eating habits, energy problem and current system, breaking bad habits in current society.. Great job P!nk 👑❤, great as usual💪🏼Hit song🔥❤

First thing to pop up on my YouTube today! Definitely needed this! AMAZING!! ❤️💃
SUMMER CARNIVAL 2023. WE WILL BE THERE BABE 💝😘
แม่ชมพู Dance กระจายเลยวุ้ย
I love Pink so much it is ridiculous! She helped me when I was a young teen and still going hard and helped me once again. She looks a little older but so do I and she is still kickin it! I married someone that favors Pink so much it is ridiculous that is how much I love her and I love my wife but I do not understand how an artist can speak so deeply to me for all these years it is more than just looks it is her realness that gets us I think. I love you Pink, forever and always you are the best artist I have ever seen or heard.
Ages ago i had thought that both Pink and Halsey were the same person with 2 names 😂
Still PINK...she's unique and Allways to be natural...I like Pink
💯👍👿🔥🌠🔥🌠🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌠🔥🌠🔥🌠🔥🔥Last days for satan and his puppets illumanati Rothschild family devils and his followers judgement day jesus
Ganz schöner Song, ganz tolles Video, Zeitgeist und Fitnessqueen.  🌹
I love You Pink
It’s just like we come back to 2000 love you
Amo esta canción. Q buen rollo ❤️❤️
This is really bad.

I love you pink 🥰😍
Música para todas las edades ❤️
Lucky  Casey....
This is so so good, very well done girl 🎉🎉
You'll know that a P!nk song is gonna be a hit when she mentions "starting a fight" in her lyrics
🤗✌👌❤❤❤💖💃🕺💓
She always brings out the best of the best!! LOVE her💖
Is Daughter her?
Welcome back pink
She is the one artist I would love to meet. Way to go pink..
P!NK Still Got it ☺

Love YOU MUM ❤❤❤❤❤
Loved it!!!

When you think you have seen the best, only for Pink to release a new banger song🫶🏻Umm damn she just gets better with age, gorgeous 💜🌸💜
I like @jaypayakumbuah
P!NK!! Always amazingly beautiful. Thank you for this🔥💯💖
The chorus sounds so much like love is in the air lmao... great originality
I have this track on repeat right now. Pure tune!   ...I fell down the stairs twice last year and took most of 2021/22 to recover. In which time, I couldn't perform or train regularly... And since I wrecked up my ankles, I now have, ugly as sin, medical braces to let me move freely again... Which makes them beautiful to me.  ...This song is my anthem for getting back in the saddle (of my wheelchair/rollator) and dancing again... Embracing my braces in the studio and on the stage!
Name samoa dancer boy?
If  someone told me that the world would end tonight You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love  But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, Lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (oh)  D-d-d-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance) I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun  'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, Lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die (I'll lay down and die) I'll scream and I'll cry (I'll scream and I'll cry) Know that I'm starting a fight  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (oh)  D-d-d-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance D-d-d-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, yeah D-d-d-d-d-dance  I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I'll cry You know that I'm starting a fight (fight) I'll lay down and die I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (hey, hey)  I'm never gonna not dance again (never gonna not dance again) Dance again (let the music play 'til the end) Dance again (never gonna not dance again) Dance again (so let the music play 'til the end) (Dance again) hey Never gonna not dance again (Dance again) (Let the music play 'til the end) let it play (Dance again) Never gonna not dance again (Dance again) (let the music play 'til the end) come on, come on (I'm never gonna not gonna dance again) (So let the music play 'til the end) yeah, yeah I'm never gonna not gonna dance again So let the music play 'til the end  Why'd it stop?
I used to love her songs but now this is just tolerated. I still think she has an amazing voice no doubt. To God be the glory.
l love pink and this video makes me love her so much more
Thanks pink,, you make me feel better 😭😭
The music video is a copy cat of "La fête" by the artist Amir! It's exactly the same!! I love Pink and the song is dope, the video is dope... but this is one of the times that the Americans copy the Europeans in music videos.
We needed this. Thank you!
Spreading positivity through mvs ✌️
I love you pink
wow!!! เป็นเพลงที่ดีมาก รู้สึกถึงพลัง มีแรงก้าวต่อไปข้างหน้า อ่อ ผมขอพิมพ์เป็นภาษาของผมเองนะ เพราะเพลงนี้ก็ทำให้รู้สึกว่า เป็นตัวเราในแบบที่มีความสุข ได้เหมือนกัน
All that talent and she keeps us dancing (and thinking)!!!! She will be a star as long as she wants to!!! Every one of her albums are stellar!
I love you pink❤

Yes P!nk!!!!
I so love this song. 🔥🔥❤️❤️ The chorus reminds me of Kelly Rowland's Commander
Sekelas pink aja 5 hari cm 5 juta view. Nih bneran popularitas lagu barat lagi kalah ama boyband sama girlband Korea. Giliran blekping aja bbrapa jam dah puluhN juta. Kangen masa2 dulu musik barat dan indo merajai billboard 😢

It's amaaazingggg
I Loveyou Pink❤️❤️❤️
I love this girl...
Perfect song to play and dance to for when the world is burning on one side and flooding on the other ✨
Extremely beautiful song.
Britney we need she hear this song! ❤️😁
What a danceable, Fabulous song from the legend PINK.Have loved PINK since she began in the music industry.Her music, lyrics really are inspirational love you PINK ♥️🌹🌈
Thankyou pink I feeling alive again !!!
And this is exactly why we love and adore Pink and have done so, since she started making music. This is exactly why she's one of the best musicians and artists ever 🙌🙌🙌💖😍🎉🤗😘.
If you hear Cant Stop The Feeling by Justin Timberlake on the back of your head, you are right! same producers, same song, same sound. what a dissapointment.
Attitude is everything you make me smile  ....ITS liberation to see inspiring artists being real
Always Cool, Always Pink ! ❤️
Seeing her when I was 13 years old - after winning tickets from a local radio station - was a highlight of my life ❤
my all time favorite female singer... ❤️
I love love love her 💖🫶 Always stayed true to herself. #PhillyGirl
Me when I go to the market to buy Provolone!  WoW 2 G
Pink rock's!! I put this song in the car and I can't stop dancing hahaha
A complete original package without pretension or subterfuge needed.  Been a fanboy for over 20 years… 🥰
P!nk fez referência a Chromatica da Lady Gaga com a bota???? Alguém percebeu ou só eu mesmo????
Well I was enjoying Pinks' music since my 18 years old  now I'm 40 but nothing changed I still enjoy Pink music she is one of my best artists ever! Desde los 18 he escuchado a pink y sigue siendo una de mis artistas favoritas 🥰
This feels like 2010😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤
P!NK大好き❤ 私の青春時代を支えてくれた存在✨ 本当にカッコいい存在✨ 愛してる❤
My new motto!! I use to say just keep dancing to the song that is played for you, being a sad or happy song, just dance.  I admire P!NK for her growth-mindset and steadfast believe in truth, abilities, family and causes. Her songs I have danced to through many life tunes and will continue to do so.
I love this song and you!!!  Thanks more than you could know.
(DANCING ON MY BED) 🫶🏼 P.S. Lookin fresh and fly P!NK
She never fails, always fabulous
Coolll! I love this Vídeo! ❤
Upside down pineapples?!?
I love Pink, but this is a straight ripoff of Betty Who’s “She Can Dance”. Seriously y’all . Look it up. Betty who is awesome and needs support!
Can’t be the only one who thinks this is utter shit
That grandma dance is op😂
Pink looking good as hell ❤️
Realizing I haven't danced in so long and miss it deeply. Thank you.
yassss Pink 🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️💃🏾💃🏾
Queen.   Learning to dance on my own.   Love it!!!!
YEAH!!!!! 🥳🎉
She is the BEST live performer I've ever seen and I've seen many in my 69 years of life!!! ❤🙏
Dasswussup gurl... U been there wen i was young and ur unique voice has accompanied my life's journey... This is the exact song i need at this point in my life. This song is quite literal for me. Ty💯💃🥺🥺✊
✊✊✊💃💃
Pink is dope AF .
What a song jam packed with good vibes. Loved Pink as always
Brazil loves you 🇧🇷❤️
AMEN✨🔥✔️  PINK God Bless her and her Family Daily❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
💕🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥WOW
0:14 - P!NK looks cute blowing bubblegum.
I love this song
IM A FAN OF PINK
Song sucks....and people in the video are hyper unattractive...
Now she's skating?!?!?! What can't this woman do?!???!???!??!?!?!??!?!
LOVE IT, LOVE P!nk!
This increíble, voice is SO beatiful,PINK IS PERFECTION 💗
t kiero p!nk <3
نظر خواستی ندارم ولی باید تابع قانون بور
Hey I grocery shop at this very store 😂
Boy, this one is a banger !  And seeing her move the way she does is pure inspiration.
I literally shop at that grocery store
Thank you Pink for keeping it classic!
That was good :-)
pink is my most favorite singer and everything above anything and everything she does she always finds a way to make me happy. she has never failed at it.
Wow🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
oh my word, oh my word, i live
Love this and love pink she’s such a vibe
This song is so catchy! Love the video!  P!nk is super talented! 😊
This is a hot mess
Pink can NOT write or sing a BAD song, EVER.  Watching her concerts and music videos have brought “ Fun “ back into my life. EVERYTIME I hear her sing, I know I’m going to sit down, listen to it over and over as well as learn the lyrics.  She’s truly talented!
Once again pink u have out done yourself. Always awesome
I’m never gonna not daaaance again what a bop man
Damn Pink is still Killin it after all these years. I love how she switches up all her shows and music. This girl has soul in her music. I've always 😍 loved her and her music. One of my favorite and stays true to herself as an artist.
so much fun thx
Cool💖💖💖💖😎😎👊👊
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
pink me encanta por fin regresamos con fuerza bella
https://youtu.be/kl36jv89F9Y
I would have liked this song, but there was some virtual signalling that I don't agree with.
The Comeback that I've waited for sooooooooo long!!!!
💘💘💘💘🦩🦩🦩🦩🦩🕺🕺🕺🕺
cute af
Amooo você
So great just as usual from pink beautyful
I love this song, too!  I wish I heard it 20 years ago.
I'm so glad Pink put out a happy, upbeat song! For the past 4ish years or so pop music has been a "who can make the saddest, slowest song" competition.
Thank you so much!  After the past 6plus years we needed this.  I will dance through whatever the next comes
I love you pink. really a big FAN ❤❤❤❤
Dude -- if you're not shakin' your booty to this then somethin' ain't right! She will never cease to amaze me.🤩🥰💃🎶💜🧚‍♀️
Xuxa, é você?
LOVE!🌺♥️♥️🎁🤭♥️🧚‍♂️🍁♥️🎈
Load shedding starts at 2:40
This is so freaking cool.!! 😎
🎶💯    https://youtu.be/F2tG8VqQCLA
I´ll allways dance, even asleep! Dance gives love to our body and soul!
Remember investigator not the judge. Your so strong I'll try to put in a word for ya. Ya know. Just a WIP that never rest.
cause Taemin said he was never gonna dance again lol
Love that vibes 😍😍
Ela está de volta
If any other artist would publish that I would be like wtf is that and I wouldn't watch till the end.. but if P!NK publishes it.. I am like - yeah, you go girl <3  I love it :)
Make some rock music pls what's up with this mall song trash 😪?
So-called artists like İnna, who takes and shares half-naked photos, set a bad example for young girls. Images must be 🔞 before they can be shared. The artist is the mirror of the society and should be an example.
I feel my depression leaving as I listen to this. She never disappoints.
Super Bowl for P!nk ❤
Thank you Alicia for always being yourself and ❤️ your new music video! 🎶 💃🕺music 🎶 has me dancing right now! 💃💃💃💃💃
Pink. You keep inspiring. And woman... seriously... is this what your body looks at this age after 2 kids? (I'm 7 months younger, so we're almost the same age and I have a daughter too). That top! I wish I had your pretty 'top' and size. Wow. Look at you. Woman. Seriously. I'm never not gonna not dance again too! You rock. A true fan since 2000. There you go helped me getting rid of my poisonous ex + Your million dreams recently helped me through the unexpected loss of my beloved mother. Thank you. In all ways.
So happy to see Kitty in this !!
I Looooooooooooooove iiiit ❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤👏👏👏💪i love it!💃
Awesome, bought a smile to my 5X year old face. (Who cares the value of X? ha ha!) Love the bit with the little girl having a 2s tantrum, going to try that next time! Such a great uplifting aong and video. :) Vlad? You're missing out on the fun comrade! Liven up and join the party! Dance dance, not war war.
Who's that girl randomly dancing while I hand you your shopping order??? This chick! And now I have the song to bust through the doors to. Your welcome Walmart customers. Thanks Pink...GOLD! Everyone like this video, listen to it buy it 10 times. We need to show her she did it again!
Pink has always been freaking gorgeous 😍
Pink never gonna not be perfect!
Masterpiece!!!:)(:give me only good vibe...
Nah.
💃
amazing honey  iloved music very very balance!!!!!

🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶💖
This is in the same League as Michael Jackson! So Good Song!
Love it and you as always
I searched for the song "Try" , as I always  do in the times of hardship and...I see this song !!! Thank you, P!NK, you're my favorite singer , artist and a person!!! Love you to bits! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Damn, I needed that!
Guuurrrrllll you looking good.
Ok song ,definitely not one of pinks better song's
until the next pandemic where she'll mask her kids and cancel tours...
The guy with the shopping cart!!!!!
I’ve had this on repeat since early in the morning. I love it so much. It’s a good song, for one. But it reminds me so much of my mom who passed in April a couple years ago (2020). She would have LOVED this song and I just know she would’ve danced around the house singing and dancing to it if she were still here today. What I would give just to be able to sing and dance with my momma 💔
It seems like Justin Timberlake's song...and I love positive songs like this!
Amei d++++ 🥰🥰🥰
Loved It!!!!!!!!
I love Pink so much ❤ I don’t give up 🌻😍 With love from Ukraine 🇺🇦 hart
Que Bueno Escuchar Música Nueva de Esta gran Cantante ❤️ Me Encanta Pink 😍
Thank you, Pink 💗💛💛💛
Love this woman since the jump!!
Love everything but the Instacart parts XD
Hi Judy my name is Misty and I also lost my husband 8 months ago. Everybody says it gets easier with time but I don't see it ever getting easier. I feel for you and I'm sorry that you had to lose your husband also. I feel there's nothing I can say or do to make it any better but I can say this. Take it one day at a time is always remember he is with you in your heart everyday. That's what gets me by. Good luck Judy.
Thats the best and greatest song EVER. I love that song <3 <3 <3
I was missing Pink❤
Cool
They just fired me 💔😢 apparently i dont respect them ✍️🤦‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ after 8 years....of working my ass for them...but you what I'M NEVER GONA NOT DANCE AGAIN 🤗🤗💛🙏
Unapologetic Resilience. AKA "P!NK" #NGNDA
Ultimate Inspirational Song for Roller-Discos?  Yes.
This is the Pink that I need in 2022!
The Ultimate Life Affirmation Anthem of our times?  Yes.    Much appreciation to all the Creators who've contributed to this. Thanks muchly, you're all Awesomeness 🙂
Me encanta Pink. Es y será siempre tan particular... 🥰😍 Y sus vídeos tan geniales
This Queen never left, Ma
Классно! Пинк такая же как и раньше 👏
Love me some Pink! ❤
There are so many bots commenting on this video. This song is so boring and generic. If it wasn’t P!NK it would never make it to the radio. Please stop P!NK. Your voice in the audio mix pierces my eardrums like a hot spike.
bad bad music
Hoping to dance forever and I'm sure when I'm 85 this will be playing in my room.  Keep it strong @P!nk
Pink rocks!!! I was dancing in my kitchen and laughing and feeling so free🎉I have always loved Pink because she is authentic and real.. you keep on rocking and rolling… and dancing👏☺️
mantap macam biasa 🔥
She did it again !!!!
terbaik
Mi eri mancata❤
I love this song
Ohh my body and soul is moving
P!NKK STOPP 😍😍
Roller 😍😍🎿🎿⛸️🎿⛸️🎿
I needed this song... After so many burdens destroying who i am... I am taking myself back. I'm never gonna not dance again ❤️🤟✌️
Badass 🔥
Jup still my favourite female representative of me in the showbizz. This is how I would look if I was you Pink. But I ain't but I could be but I ain't. Hope to see you in person one time my sister. Seeing how much fun you all have in the video clip making it. That's what it is all about having fun peeps.
不管你幾歲時都可以很開心的跳舞🎉
Awesome track - awesome vibe!!
Perfect song
1:50 perfectly captures everything that i ever thought pink would be. except for the actual color pink.... i thought the actual color could have been anything it ever wanted to be. when i said "pink" in my first sentence.. i was refuring to this google regurgitation.  wow i spelled regurgitation correctly by accident.  thanks piunk
She’s the perfect picture of Crazy & Sane ❤ this is what Role Models are made of!
Pink does it right! I also kinda wanted my chips :)
💚🤍❤️
Love anything about her
Куда ж без повесточки
I wish to see you soon in Free Iran .love you pink. Women Life Freedom✌
I miss Pink, love her song
Love this song and video@ she's SO BAD ASS
Pink siendo Pink :)
Is that man or woman?? Im so confused 😕
forever a fan of Pink
I needed this!!!!!! Thank you!
Song for sensan Olivia Jacob
OMG!!! My new song!!! Thank you Pink!! I love this song!!! Im never not gonna dance again!!!
I love pink music
First Pink is Back!! 💗💗💗
Why am I crying? I love this so much 😭
Thank  you Pink ! I love your songs !!💜🙂🌈
Pink is not just singing songs with words she is selling hope
Crap song , Pink is irrelevant these days anyway. She's been well and truly overtaken by Taylor Swift and co
This is why I always have and always will love Pink. I remember the day I saw her live at Pinkpop 2010 in The Netherlands as if it was yesterday. Thank you for existing pink, thank you for spreading love and acceptance wherever you go <3
Always stunning N young
2:10 When u stub ur toe
Pink is back baby!
Tanto quieren grabar haciendo compras en el supermercado, le falta más idea original, ya parece Shakira 🤣🤣
But He said Wait... 😆❤ you are awesome!!

Wow, just wow. I literally just went on a social media fast a couple days ago. I just got the urge to unplug. I've been being intentionally present with my loved ones, reflecting, meditating, journaling, stretching, yoga and studying. For P!nk to drop THIS song after such a long hiatus at this time in my life is more than a coincidence.
This queen is making hit after hit for almost 25 years! She is the coolest!💜
This song reminds me of my mom so much. When she was battling cancer and had a transmetatorsal amputation she said that one day she would Dance Again. Here it is 8 years later and I know she’s in heaven dancing. As for me, I am gonna dance again as well through my pain, through my struggles. I’m Never Not Gonna Dance Again. Thank you P!nk for inspiring me to continue to fight
I love that Whitney Houston reference. This is a great, funky song!
This is what we needed. Pink is great. This song is awesome from the first time you hear it ! Love from Mexico 🇲🇽
0:07 When they ask what I’m doing in the Dm’s
Can someone tell me where I can find this grocery store? I so tired of ralphs 🤷🏾‍♂️
Ever goona Dance again Wow mind blowing Pink Rocks 1 more time..!!
The world need a songs like this❤
i still remember my fvrte song Family potret!!!  ur huge fan from Malaysia papagoatee Malaysia
I love the new rock shoes , and of course pink and the song lol
I love this song too, between midnight Song lists by Tay 🖤
Content de ce chouette morceau. L'artiste est dans sa veine, et ça continue à faire un bien fou !  💓🙂
She can do any genre I swear this is like r&b and soul and dance all in one forever a legend my queen pink
Omg you have done it again pink with another hit 😍😍😍😍😍😍 “keep on rocking  and as you” would say never stop dancing
💃💃💃👏👏👏
I luv Pink, she's brilliant!
I'm so glad you're still making music ❤️💝 XOXO
I guess I'd be the construction worker now 🤣😅
One of the few artists that is truly a great rolemodel and human being
I fell over on skates nearly two years ago and it hurt for a while. Recently I got my skates on and went to a skate group party, freedom!...all great till one person lost her balance and pulled me down until I fell...again.  I will not give up, I will NEVER give up dancing, roller skating, riding bikes, paddle boarding, singing!!
Joy joy joy 😊 💗🎉
This woman is a LEGEND in live
Too bad she's woke asf.
Love!
PINK I love you so muchhhhh you are always a very beautiful woman every time ı hear your voice my energy rises ı feel strong Loves from Turkey
It's an upbeat song but why do I feel emotional towards the end of the song 😭❤💙
Good 🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I was curious on how she would pull off that "NoT" in the middle of the song, but it turned out ok
AWSOME SHADE OF BLONDIE MISSUS PINK
LOVE her!
Pink speaks from a place of raw truth and pure attitude, she never backs down to pressure and knows how to bring a smile through dark times!
A fun song with a great theme and message running through it. Pink forever :-)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6U0NuNx6Rs
Omg... Just OMG
Man …. PINK! Says it ! I am experiencing loss. I am  hearing  her new tracks without  my partner for the first time. Pink! Is the  owner of honesty and once again healing me  ( and my partner somewhere out there 🌈🙏 ).   Pink! Thank you for memories, for love and simply connecting me always with the man I love.
such a feel good song <3 love it !
I realy realy need pop/rock p!nk back !! I hate to say this as someone who was a fan since the start of her career but the moment she became a mom she  turned from a cool pop/rock chick into a kinda basic and boring pop singer and i realy don't like it.  I want the old p!nk back. Hwr last 2 albums are boring as fuck and i realy dont want a other pop album full of basic songs from her .
Love her🤩❤
PINK's music will always be relevant!
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
Siempre tan radiante 🍫tan original💯tan fabulosa 🍸tan única 🍾🥂 Krlosduq
P!NK kicks off the dark world  this is the artist  Songs we need these days  Pop must be like this  With P!NK at the forefront, I want other artists to release bright songs!
Years go by and her music keeps been just amazing, and so is she... Astonishing mama🙌🏼
akala yung nasa trolls na music❤
毎日　これ　見てる🇯🇵💕
Brazil love you pink 🇧🇷🇧🇷♥️♥️♥️♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷
A happy song but I'm crying
That’s amazing 🤩 pink forever ❤
just a Pink🇲🇿
Love u 🧸
Oh gosh why is this so emotionally charged ;_;
Ok ❤️...I was thinking 🤔 George Michael, but ok🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♀️💪🏾
Thank you Pink!! I don't know why, but for the last couple of weeks I've been wishing harder than usual for you to release some new songs, and tonight this popped up. When I've been struggling in life, it's been YOUR music that has helped me get through! And I have been struggling lately. That's probably why you've been on my mind. So THANK YOU for this!! I love you so much 💙💜  God Bless you Pink 🙏
She will literally NEVER disappoint!
But where can I find info about that banging black corset she wears?
I love Pink & her music so much 🤍🛐
i used to look up to you so much, but this is just utter trash. i guess you decided screw it and did a bunch of drugs to come up with this massive disappointment. i liked you because you were different, but now you're just like every other barbie doll singer, using your body to gain popularity.
why did it stop??
Is it weird that I cried while listening to this song?? It’s so beautiful, keep dancing everyone! Be unapologetically you.
https://youtu.be/INA8UczUqHE
I’d love to hear a Pink/Carley Ray anthem. Which how bad it’s getting maybe they can save us with music. Zoe give us the ultimate dance song as the world ends
Video not good....the Song Is nothing new.....almost...EVERYTHING .....she did before..,..however lPink. Is Pink 👏👌💪
💓
love pink
1:52

Amazing!
Man, I already forgot how much I like Pink 🤗
Found my new new years song wooo pinkkk
This good vibe happy vibe thank you pink i miss you🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Looove it... The type of music video off Pink takes me way back. Yaaas queen!!!
Good thing she is  multi talented, she can dance and sing. Personally i would be bummed out if she couldn't sing again.
Thanks, needed this so much!
Why wasn't the alpaca dancing?
PINK YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST YOUR MUSIC TOUCH SO MANY HEARTS KEEP GOING GIRL THANK YOU.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpeR0blXRYY&t=2888s
Love 😍😍😍😍
Its definitely interesting to see and hear disco-esk style music again. 💜
My mom is all OVER this song! This is everything she loved! I can hear her belting it out, shouting and laughing in the face of her illness as she roller skates through a grocery store. Thank you so much for such an awesome reminder. I'm still dancing!!!
I love it
I first heard this on the radio a couple of days ago and I liked it right away! Well done Pink and welcome back.
Wow...Cool P!NK
She is the coolest the  chick! Idk why no one has ever tried to get her to act in any movies or shows because every video she's in, she gives 100%! She's an awesome actress as well as musician! Love her!!!
That fit was very Missundaztood and it took me back!! Love this, love her and I'm never not gonna be a fan!!
Personally going through a healing period in my life. If Pink’s sing “Courage” is my healing mantra/motivation, this song will be my celebration and promise when I’m through it.
me gusta porque es fresco y muy alegre , tan rosa como ella 😉😉
yesss
"We already wasted enough time!" ♥
She deserve something great⭐✨
Pink is the only artist I've seen through the years that keep being true to herself and we all love her for it
I LOVE THIS TALENTED WOMAN..WOW!!!
I LOVE PINK!!!!!
This takes some time to get used to it but I'm loving this song now! ❤️😍
The positive uptempo song that the world needs right now!
2.9m views only in 3 days, this deserves more than 10 or 20m views in its first week. I love P!nk! - 🇵🇭
You are magic and sunshine and love! ❤️
I ❤ U P!NK  ❤❤❤❤
yess a new Max Martin BOP
Thank you for existing my dear Pink
The fact that she had hip surgery this time last year and is reminding us she's not going to stop dancing makes this that much better🥰 stay encouraged folks! You'll get through the trials.  Your best is yet to come!
Musica nova. ❤

Can we appreciate how she looks ageless🥰
Democrats are eating this up
I love how a lot of your songs are all like a protest, with the perfect vibe.
Honestly love P!NK, has a child she helped me in a lot in finding my own confidence and my own style. She truly is a role model and here is another masterpiece to show everyone don't be shy about your own self. LOVE IT ❤️❤️
Girl you’re a queen! I love your music so much! You never disappoint with your music!
I love the Whitney Houston mention, also the song kinda feels like an hommage or sequel to I Wanna Dance With Somebody...
Great tune! I saw her open for Justin Timberlake it was a PARTY! She was so good and was having so much fun! She can sing! Great, great!
Te amo. 💖
Loving it!!! Another #1 for  the world to dance to!!! Dance girl!!!
hermosa eres Pink love <3<3<3
Beautiful
pink i broke the replay button again......sorry, this woman cannot put out a bad song.
Once again PINK delivers sheer goodness. She even incorporates a little of 1999 Pink
Why does the image look squished vertically like the Sandman?
I've read that the old lady in the video is her grandma. Pretty cool!
I want what that kids eating. Is it a marshmellow or ice cream cookie sandwich?
Who just searched for Pink today ? , i know i'm happy i did, I love this Song 😍😍🤩🏳‍🌈
Miss her atlast she back again 😍
This is a BANGER…and I’m also digging that sax in the background! Props to Pink for shedding light in our world! 🫶🏼
I'm so proud of my Girl 😚😚😚😚😉😉😉😏
It is a good thing that pop singer portrays with so much sincerity the real state of american poor huge population. Those faces, those bodies, those fellows are so real. The fill up the cities of America. USA.
❤❤ from 🇸🇳
Oh my word!! You’ve done it again!! You got this grumpy old sod smiling, laughing, singing and yes… dancing!! Love this so much. Xxxx
reminds me of that Justin Timberlake song
Excelente, gracias Pink
So glad to see her back, looking better than ever. P!nk, you never dissapoint
She can serve anything and we will eat it up.
AMAZING...PING BIG STAR 😍😍😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻BEATHIFUL...BLESSING...HUGGS FROM ARGENTINA 🇦🇷🇦🇷
She must been with Justin Timberlake in a past life
Labyu pink ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏
Pink is one of my favorite singers. This woman is one of the few that knows how to put a smile on my face. Pink thanks for all your beautiful energy. I don't know if it is coming but it will put it out there in the Universe, but a Residency in Vegas would be awesome!!!!!! #pink
My beautiful trauma🥰🥰🥰
Musa, linda, maravilhosa!!!!
I love it! We need to dance to fill this world so full of hate and sadness with joy!!!! Thank you Pink, you are the best!💖

So necessary❤ I just smiled during the whole song.
Omg!! I love it!! She's back again, love you!!
Keep on dancing 🎶 💃
super
A legend 💕
This song is pure joy!!!! Love it!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
❤
Música maravilhosa, estava com saudade de uma música farofa da P!nk!
Pink having the Stouffers frozen meal in the carriage is so real. 👌
Dance battle!
All I’m saying is “roll on the UK tour! Can’t wait to see you” 😊❤💃🎼🎶🪩 xx
The eternal sycrinicity  of  artist.   Love may it keep us.   Tender heart and  loving  life
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!! But it sure was weird when she said they can take her dog 😆 😆 not the dog!!!
Amazing Lady!!! What a Spirit❤❤💛💛
I now really want to wear roller-skates to the grocery store.
Very nice ❤️
Oh I love this

Alan walker headlights remix is out now link here : https://youtu.be/7EEEUhWVg_c
Justin Timberlake?
Realmente, os jovens parecem zumbis com celular na mão, tudo idiotizado e sem aproveitar a vida.
il l'aimait à la folie elle est géniale ouissss😘😘😘😘😘💯💯💯💯🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Pink never disappoints!❤️
I LOVE YOU PINK But one question tho... why the Lama ? like Why ? what ? how ?
I like Pink and a great singer but why are these MVs so generic
Can't relate. Looks like a grocery in a privileged posh gated progressive neighborhood. Looks nothing where I live.
sooooo dope
PINK to the rescue once again!! Every time I get to the place where I feel, "What's the point, life just sucks." She comes out with a banger like this or a poignant song that soothes my soul. Pink is a genre unto herself.
This reminds me of a mature “So What” 🥹🙌🏾🙌🏾
Pink. You R such an inspiration to our world. Our youth need you and you gifts to the world. Never stop rockn it brat girl. I can hear it too! 🎶

If this doesn't become a hit I'm gonna become mad
😁🤍🙂
OMG after all these years Pink never dimmed that shine within her! Still awesomely talented and vibrant as ever! This is why I'll always be her fan! <3
Only P!NK can pull off a video of her rollerskating through a supermarket! Lol she makes me wanna go back to a rollerskating rink and do it! She knows how to make us get up and dance!
I love her style music , life , outfit 😍 ✨️ ♥️
love that grocery store

I love the song, the vibe it's giving us, the message of the song. Everything about it. I pray that Pink can live a longer life for her to continue bringing us inspiring song ☺️
Can we talk about how HOT and empowered still being Pink!?!?
Wonderful as always and thank you for your continuing support of the LGBTQI community and diversity in general.
❤️❤️ so cool being able to grow up with a childhood fave that is still out here killing it. Fucking love her.
Whitney I wanna Dance with somebody  P!nk Never gonna not dance again 😅😅
this is awesome love the lyrics it’s like always be a inner child why she is an icon. the kid having a tantrum on the floor that’s exactly what you do when they see how silly it is they usually stop
Why is every song she puts out a total ANTHEM?
that literally made my cheeks smile thank you you that!!!!!
Love it!!!!
Living for this song and that second outfit!!
our songs are for a better good btw 🦄
I'm guessing this was shot at Walmart?  Awesome song & video!!!!!
I like Pink, she has honesty
Loved this...
Wow I love this song so much thanks you guys.
Love you P!nk, omg this song is amazing. Thank you so much!!😍 💗

She is amazing

Absolutely unique! ❤️
The mintest 👌🏾 Pink looking best yet 😻 Mama always spreading love and light thank you 🎵
<3
Daaamn it was about time finally to bring back real MUSIC to the scene!!! Thanks PINK!!
I don't understand her appeal as a singer. I like her as a person but her voice and style just isn't for me.
Why I'm in tears? It's so inspiring for me❤️
I love choirs and the choir at the end of this new favorite song, gives me chills.
she is timeless
I love you so much! This Song is pure warmth and love
Such an amazing song to get me out of my funk!! Thank you 🙏
Quel plaisir dans ce monde morose ! Merci merci merci 😘
Please, please, please announce another Australian tour. I really, really want to see Pink in concert.
-1 one Osmon. We run it. I guess you know. I promised to dance. I broke my pelvis. I ended up partially paralyzed. Nothing could stop me. Dancing after the pelvis is repaired. Doctors hate me about letting the Taylor kids get home safe... Let's see if my credit increased... We run it.
ピンク姐さんは、ずっとピンク姐さん💕
P!nk is pretty back!! Stream it!!! P!nk never disappoints us!
Love the return to roller skating.
P!nk is just amazing. I love this vibes and song.
Pink rocks...love her and her music ...I think she lives here in las vegas ...somewhere with the mansions like jenny lopez  but my respects to them ,let them have their personal lives too ...but us fans will see u on tour concerts
I love it
Love it 💖
Hair icon and body goals 🍬
Pink was born to elevate everybody’s mood no matter what. Hands down. Thanks for making me smile - and move my body - every time.
Such an amazing song <3
This personally hits home, I have been struggling  with thyroxine deficiency and morbid obesity, add to that just this August I was diagnosed with 2 herniated disks. I am a prrson who loves walking and dancing and I'm not able to do it. I am acting all fine and happy but actually feeling left alone and terrible about my body. I was professionally getting trained dancer as a child. I STOPPED myself from dancing when things got hard during my preteens. This song just makes me feel I'll overcome it all again and maybe through dancing. Thanks my love for this song.
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I'm so glad it's a happy dance anthem instead of her preachy drivel from past 10 yrs
Teenage doesn't work for you anymore. Do some "real strong women" songs. Women getting stuck in the past are still girls. Are you doing this sh*t just to make bank? Because, Teenage doesn't work for you anymore. Sorry, just being honest.
WHERE ARE MY CHIPS THAT WILL MAKE ME SHIT MY PANTS
Smiled through the entire video! Love Pink!
Love it!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💪💚💛
I LOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!
Hermosa mi amada P!nk, ya necesitábamos esta canción en nuestra vida 😍🕺🏻💃🏻🤸🏻‍♂🛼🌚
I love how Pink gives the public exactly what they need at exactly the right time. We need a cheer-me-up song in COVID, she “covers us in sunshine”. We’re not “alright” because human rights are being challenged, she advocates that through her music. We need to get out, dance, and enjoy our lives again and she gives us this banger. A music legend, ❤ Pink
Thanks For save my Life once again, It comes on a difficult moment, but with this i feel i can do anything i want.... Thanks Pink I really Love You...
Damn! I can't delete the melody from my mind and my body moves by itself enjoying the song. Damn you, Pink... come and dance with me! 😆
Pink with the pineapples! ♥️♥️
Simplesmente maravilhosa Pink !  Fan Brasileiro !  ...
This is an instant favorite. P!nk does it again. ❤
The lama gives me life 🙌 🤣🦙
The most original 80's music of the year. Congratulations!
I danced my whole life then became paralyzed, I'm learning how to dance again. It's killing me to not be able to dance again.
Love!
P!NK IS BACKKKKKK
I feel like this song came out for me, i had a car accident where i cant still dance for a while (saying that i am a prossional dancer) but once my knee, leg and back , get back i will dance and never stop again.
#Stillalegend ❤️❤️
🥰😍
Great song💜💜 I really like you pink
Like her from day one. Her first song and her bright pink hair and killer video. There you go. Keep doing you PINK💖💖💯
I love you.  you just get me with your song.
Pink is is the coolest and humblest human being ❣️
Oh dear 😑.

Girl! I love everything about you ! Style dance music ! One a kind artist! So what??? Guys ?? What do ya think??
I needed a song like this! thank you Pink! I love you!
My sister and mother killed my cat today 😞 just thought I'd share this
She’s too old for this song.
I love her music but this is sad. She is 43 years old and making teenie bubble gum music. Wow.
Waooo, this is so cool!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Pink is a national well international treasure!! we love you!! #danceagain
Awesome!
Pink never fails to deliver!
I am about to be 42, like Pink, your musical journey has always inspired empowerment for me. 2 months ago, I wanted to roller skate again since I have lost 60 lbs. since 2020.   Thank you for always growing with me.
Damn I wish I could get back the couple of minutes I wasted on this crap.
P!nk is really one of a kind. She always reinvents herself and her music. I can't remember she ever had a bad single released. They are all good.
P!NK NEVER FAILS US!!! There’s so much inspiration in this song! I wonder if she knows how she changes our world for the better! Her songs are therapeutic!!! SHOW OF HANDS IF YOU WERE DANCING TOO!!!!
Why does this simple pop song make me so emotional?  Maybe simply because this little pop song was made with love.
Loved it love her ❤
OMG! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
PERFECT!!!
That stouffers mac & cheese is good 👏🏾✨
Love Pink! ❤️
retail employees around the world trembling in fear.... the terrible reign this song is gonna have is sick
i love her so much
The beat is the same as everybody else ?? Good voice though but don't they all  everybody is cut from the same cookie cuter
I GREW UP LISTENING TO P!NK SHE CONSISTENTLY EVOLVES. LITERALLY LOOK AT HER CATALOG. SHE IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST INFLUENCES PERIOD FOR MUSIC. LOVE YOU P!NK ! THANK YOU FOR STAYING TRUE TO YOURSELF IN REAL LIFE & IN MUSIC. 💕💕💕💕💕
This was on the radio Friday night as I was driving back into the state from attending a good friends wake…this is what I needed to lift my spirits
pink s humor is insane , i love this woman with all my heart
El nuevo disco de ella será bailable y vendrá mucha música bailable en inglés este año ojalá venzan al reggaeton
Que buena canción tan alegre y bailable Pink está de regreso señoras y señores 😃🥳

Love all PINKS songs!!! There so motivational!! I love you PINK!!!
Is that Halsey?
I loved this one! She never dissapoint us 😍
Always warms my heart😍
The world needs more love for others and dance. We are all stressed, angry and frustrated when the solution is within us. It's never too late to be happy and make others happy. Start by putting your shoes on, dancing and smiling.
What made you choose a grocery store? 'Cause it goes perfect with this song.
Such a beautiful song powerful voice Pink has! 🙌🙌👋👋👋👋😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️

Never gets old😍😍😍
Pink does make the type of music for running to the grocery store
Pink is awesome.  I have never had the experience of seeing her live and probably never will.  But ive heard its beyond.  She never gets the recognition she deserves from awards but as she might say ###so what. She knows her fans love her so much. She should be doing the superbowl.  Sorry not sorry Rhianna fans.
If someone told me that the world would end tonight You could take all that I got for once I wouldn't start a fight You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun My birthday cake, my soul, my dog take everything I love  But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already waste enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records Take off all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance) I got all good luck and zero fucks don't care if I belong, no If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb We're never getting young, so I'm gonna have so fun  'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancing shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry Know that i'm starting a fight  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records Take off all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, yeah, d-d-d-dance  I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I cry You know that I'm starting a fight (Fight) I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I cry We've already waste enough time We've already waste enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records Take off all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, yeah, d-d-d-dance I'm never gonna not gonna dance so let the music play 'til the end
She Still has tht "SpiCe",👍🏼😎.
Em 3:06 só sentir que conseguimos passar por tudo que nos fizeram nesse governo do Bolsonaro
Obrigado mãe por me colocar nesse mundo na mesma época da p!nk
It’s her voice, smile, hair, attitude, amazing body… this woman always delights/entertains us. We love you P!nk ❤

No fuera Jlo o Thalia que sacará un vídeo en un súper mercado como el de Shakira  que ya están la gente tirando odio. Pero como es pink no dicen nada. Ypor que no dicen que pink quiere colgarse del vídeo de Shakira a ver ?
Pure perfection 💣🖤

Words can't describe how much I love you. I've been with you since "There You Go" and your music never gets old. Thanks for all the amazing songs you've shared with the world! 🥰 Including this one. I'm working from home and listening... just twerking in my office chair 😂 The worlds been a f#@*ed up place these past few years, so artists like you don't realize just what you do for us. This song made me smile! Thanks! 😁
New disco in house by style of pink. That's awesome song.
Once again we got something we have nothing to complain. Thankful for this song ❤️
❤️❤️❤️🥂🥳🥳🥂🚀🚀🚀👯👯🎸 Love Crazy Pink 🚀🤩😁😻
I love it! 🎉❤

Ol' good vibez.. 🕺 Again
Cuando pense q no podía ser mas perfecta, aparece P!nk en patines... nunca deja de sorprenderme ❤❤❤❤
Her videos are always about having fun, love!
I'm never gonna not Pink again.
You can take Taylor Swift, you can take Katy Perry, you can take Nicki Minaj, but don't EVER... EVER!!! take my Pink away!
this is so fuckin fun I love it
I MISS BLACK PINK SO MUCH....
A great song from Pink again 💯👌
What a fucking legend
You smiled all the way through that song and video be HONEST.. thanks for this Pink...
I love how she just handles life in her own way. She's strong in every possible way and there will NEVER be such a force like her EVER AGAIN!♥️♥️♥️
What does the "free" mean? It's written under the title with green.
Pink is the only artist I've seen through the years that keep being true to herself and we all love her for it❤❤
You will never know how much I needed this song. I've been feeling like I cant even get out of bed, let alone dance. This song makes me want to try again.. to really try and dance again. Thank you again Pink for being the voice inside my head
Moral of the story: she’s the artist we all love and need. 🤩
This is her best lead single since "There you go." In my opinion. That key change is exquisite and those dance moves are astonishing.
I love how her music always has an insightful and empowering message. Since back in the day her lyrics are always on point. Thanks Pink ❤️
This is incredible! Her voice, the beat and the positive message of the video. Im so glad artist understand the power of their influence as the world is in such a dark and heavy time. We NEED to dance and have up lifting pop songs to help us thru the nightmare of the pandemic. Thank you Pink!!  ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My mom was a huge pink fan ❤I wish she was here to see pink still creating magic ❤️🙏🏾
At this point P!nk is a legend in pop music period. 20 + years of good music, great tours and iconic music videos (aswell as hair styles) and she’s still going strong 💪🏾😍😁
Que presente de aniversário. Obrigado P!nk, você mora no meu ❤️.🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I'm 38 and have been in love with Pink since age 17. She has never disappointed with her music...such a beautiful and talented woman.
SHE IS A LEGEND! When I was 13 years old back in 2001 her Album "Missundaztood" was the soundtrack of my life at the time, it helped me a lot. I can not thank her enough for that.
The diversity of Pink is AMAZING. No matter your ethnicity, she's relatable n everyway. I also love that she releases music at her own pace. Issa WINNER 🏆🙌🏾🤎🤎🤎
P!nk can easily be the most complete artist in the industry…she writes,she sings,she dances, she does acrobatics, she inspire, she is sexy and everything is done amazingly
P!NK literally does not age! She looks just as young and beautiful as when she first stepped into the music scene. And she sounds just as amazing too! How can anyone not love her?!
Let's be honest P!nk never make bad songs and never disappoints us, it's gonna be a masterpiece for sure. Welcome back Queen P!nk
I am sitting here with tears running down my face.  I needed this so much!  My husband died 7 months ago and I'm about to move to assisted living.  I love this song and you!!!  Thanks more than you could know.
P!nk had her first hit 22 years ago and to see her evolve as an artist and a person has been nothing less than inspiring. I am still watching her in awe 22 years later and love her as much now as I did then. Whenever I start feeling like shit about myself I think back to a few of her songs and remember she's endured her share of criticism and still continues to be exactly who she is...P!nk
Hermosa mi amada P!nk, ya necesitábamos esta canción en nuestra vida 😍🕺🏻💃🏻🤸🏻‍♂️🛼🌚
I just love how she includes all people from all walks of life in her videos. She has changed so much from her early years and I still love her songs, some with so much meaning. I hope she never changes, except only to get even better.
最高！P!NK!!!
Pink has always been the embodiment of "I know I'm cool,  I don't give a fuck, fuck you, you wish you were this cool" for over 20 years and still going just as hard.
I love how Pink gives the public exactly what they need at exactly the right time. We need a cheer-me-up song in COVID, she “covers us in sunshine”. We’re not “alright” because human rights are being challenged, she advocates that through her music. We need to get out, dance, and enjoy our lives again and she gives us this banger. A music legend, ❤ Pink
P!nk is really one of a kind. She always reinvents herself and her music. I can't remember she ever had a bad single released. They are all good.
I came in thinking "Gee, one more crap out. This song is not so cool" and left thinking " Gee, I love the vídeo and what I catchy chorus! 🤩"
Lol I love Pink 🥰 She’s a rare gem that the world needs 🙏🏾
P!nk fiel a sí misma y atemporal. Canta, compone, baila, hace acrobacias y tiene un rango vocal increíble y poderoso , además de un directo de 10. No se puede pedir más. Gracias por ser, estar y compartir. ERES AUTÉNTICA
P!NK does it again and again🎉 love her
Brilliant video when I get better i hope to be dancing again i love dancing so much thank you for posting 😍
The alpaca was unnecessary..
Pink is the best 🌹

Eu amo muito essa mulher meu pai!  Que clipe e música contagiante  Amooooo
P!nk, obrigado pela energia deliciosa do vídeo <3
I love 💘 all things Pink
My inspiration 😭😭😭😭😭😭 endless Love ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Isn't this the person who sexually harassed young Bieber? 🤔🚩
This is an awesome record and music video. I wish I was there!!!
In a true authentic American way, unhealthy habits are glorified in a copy cat disco style video to a song that it’s hard to tell who the “artist” is. Money, money, money…. 😏
OMG!!! 🕺🏿💃🏿🌈🎉
I love that she just randomly dances around a supermarket
<3
Thanks for this amazing Song ! Party your Life ! Life will be a Party for you! 😅#channelofgoodmood
It feels like a good idea

Amei .
PinkLOVE💝
My new theme song!!
I don’t like this Jojo Siwa-esque Pink. She needs to go back to her roots.
P!NK✨✨✨✨✨💜💜💜😍😍😍😍😍
Same 👉 💩 again
And in true fashion pink does it again, love you mama
I like this great job!
Girl, you never cease to amaze me!!! Keep Dancing!!! (Throw in some aerobics too!!!) Hugs my friend...

I’m not gonna lie this song got me crying cause I hate my ghetto school that makes me depressed I just wanna be happy like I used to be
can't for a live version of this from a music awards show with P!nk belting out while dancing on roller blades maybe while she was hanged in the air? hahaahah ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So happy song, lov it... 😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Always irreverent and.... Musical? I've surprised 😀😀😀😀
Wish she could sing rock song.. rock songs suits her more than pop
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
❤️
I really loved it, this song brings good vibes and we needed it, thanks Pink

Love your masterpiece ❤❤❤
I love pink!!!
Factatic too músic
Finally a dance song!!! Lol <33
Very good Pink Yu aré beatiful
Achei que tava fazendo o L na capa
❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can hear the influence from "Can't Stop This Feeling" on this song ... Max Martin behind it ... But personally Alicia and Max wrote and produced better songs in the past. Both on fun side and on the emotional side.  While still being truthful to her personal and musical attitude, the sound of it does not "scream" Alicia to me. Maybe due to its closeness to Timberlake's "Can't Stop This Feeling".
Such a FUN song and video! We all need this right now! Thanks Pink! 💞
The song the video remind me of 2014
😘💃
She deserves a SuperBowl asap!!!
This shyt corny af mid life crisis cringe type stuff here smh pink need to stay gone w her has been.
I really love this song. So positive.  What a fun record
P!NK looks 43 like 23! I hope she's never getting old
Sie ist unglaublich ... ihre Musik begleitet mich seit so vielen Jahren - durch sehr schlechte und sehr gute Zeiten. Wenn alles um mich herum dunkel wird und ich in einen Sog gerate, der mir den Boden und den Füßen zu nehmen scheint, sind es ihre Stimme und die Kraft, die diese Powerfrau ausstrahlt und ich bekomme wieder Halt - habe wieder Lust am Leben und kann wieder tanzen.... Danke für dieses Hammerlied! Danke P!nk.... all the best to you and your lovely ones...
Grande artista e grande mulher!!!🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
I just love her, She reminds me my favorites days of my life 🤩🥰🥰🥳
Her voice is still as stunning as ever! Timeless Diva!
Eu te amo ❤️❤️
Just when I need her, here comes P!nk again to save the day. This arrives right on time in my life. We are indeed not getting any younger. Dance! ❤️❤️❤️
too many ppl are so full of anger and loneliness, music & dance can bring back joy, if we allow ourselves to enjoy them💜
I am absolutely in love with Pink as an artist. I need her and Jessie J to collab.
You know, no matter what style of music she makes an underlying message that you can always feel from PINK is that literally everyone is welcome to sing (and dance) along with her.  Whether you like her music or not that should mean something.
Ela voltou 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩. Amoooooooooooooooooooo
ABSOLUTELY LOVE You! You are such a beautiful woman; inside and out! Made fill full of joy! 🤘💜🤗🤩
Fantastic.  Made me smile from beginning to end. Dance on!!
Once again P!nk knocked it out of the park!.🩷💞💕💗
Easy to say that you never not dance again when you have a mansion and fist full of cash! Me? The world can go ahead and end! The dance is dead!
Two things that is certain in life. Music trends and styles change, but Pink will always be Pink and she will remain relevant and loved.
Before you listen...get careless whisper out of your head
Спасибо супер гуд,!!!
P!nk never failed to entertain us❤️👏🏽
I love her!!!
Go grandpa
This song bangs harder than my uncle 😍
she always introduce new song with conviction.
I see an early 2000's Pink back to the scene! I love it!!! ❤
If u know how great this song is love the 90s
Very good
She looks amazing 😍😍😍🛼🛼🛼
Love your song pink!!! Thank you making beautiful song, apriciate... My life soooo bored. Will played this song a lot

🎧❤🇲🇳
😆😘😍
https://youtu.be/eftruF4wQi0
Wow, I was feeling miserable and now I feel light.
looks like someone took some of her vacation to watch kpop videos... ;)
I want my life to be like a Whitney Houston song...just perfect!
🎉😂
LETS MAKE THIS TRACK BIGGGGG BY SHARING IT GUYS.WHAT A MASTER PICE BY PINK TO ALL THE SHY PEOPLE.POSITIVE VIBES.
Everyone says my mom looks like you it's so weird
Wow 🤗wish everyone wasn't still sleeping 😏 would be a good one to crank up😋
❤️
this is how everyone is post covid 😅
P!nk was my mother’s favourite artist, and when my mother passed, I kept listening to P!nk to remember her. Every time P!nk now releases a new song or album, I am always sure to sit by my mother’s grave the next day, and have it playing on my phone to her.
i lost it when that lezbian couldnt handle her lil cone when pink put on that butch outfit in the taco truck. yaaas we living 🏳️‍🌈
This feels like P!nk´s version of "can´t stop this feeling" and I´m living for it!
When I lived in Palm Springs, I had to buy milk at Wallgreens after my restaurant job in rollerblades (no car) and they let me do this in the AISLES! WAS HELLA FUN 🛼
AMAZ!NG!!!!!!!!!!P!NK
Hino!!!!
Você é maravilhosa , linda ,  única ... Pra mim é a melhor cantora do mundo !
Yungblud..nice bit of pink white and blue programing like a certain flag
It's a good song. Reminds me of Justin Timberlakes "Can't fight the feeling". But the be honest, I am not that impressed. It's not going to be a classic.
on-brand AF for pink. LOVE HER CUT IN THE BACK & THE DANGLY BEAR FEET LOOKED LIKE A NUTS LOL... SO IM IN 🧸
This feels so good
Best female artist/performer!
Good songs ❤️❤️❤️❤️💗💗😍😄😄🫠🫠🫠🤢😈😈😈🤡🤡👍🤜👍🐻🐹🐻‍❄️🐨🐨🐷🙈🐮🐮🐵🐯🐼🐼🐼🐔🐥🐥
Toda mi vida enamorada de p!nk
The first video clip this year put a smile on my face while watching it Thanks #Queen_Pink ❤️
Actually, she would never be able to perform that song in the town of Chillingbourne. 🚫🎵🚫
I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song
thank you 💖
crying
Always loved pink 😊😁👏🌟
Pink siendo Pink! ❤
Queen is back
Oh well. You told people like me to NOT listen to your music.
so good 😍
A nossa rainha voltou 🇧🇷
She got wokoharam........n her voice faded.........iam out!
the retail zombie still swiping away LOL
Joyfulllllllllllllll!!!
🎶Perfect song for my Summer ☀️ 🇳🇿 it's like a throwback, bits of her past choreography thrown in 💖✨️ love it!!
💜💃🕺💃🤩🥳🙌🙌🙌
1:37 Pushing a cart with rollers on is hilarious cuz you better have traction underneath your shoes to be able to push forward... Love her belting as usual.
Amanda back power
I miss Rock'n'Roll P!NK... :/
💪❤️
Need a Justin “cant stop the feelin” pink combo.
Love love love! Stunning return P!nk!!!! Please come to South Africa again for tour. Plssssssss.
Pink You’re getting old. Quit while you’re not going to turn into a Madonna.
YESS!!!!!!🎉✨💃#strippingforever🤌✊🖕
Lot of white people to be using African descent dances and names and rederences, but, pink is white so I guess.  Uh, just weird, weird to be so obsessed with only having white people.  Is pink everything ok,?
great song minus those flags the rainbow has 7 colors not 6 God bless her
The song is worse than average and the video is unpleasant on the eyes.  3 out of 10
Bless you P!nk for making awesome soul touching music.
She sounds like Kelly Clarkson!
I’m coming to your concert next year in Birmingham!!!!🎉🎉🎉
that black outfit she wears is awesome. it reminds me of her younger self back in the day
It is like a Hillsong Advertisement.......
I feel like the song is missing something… it needs more of a EDM feel to it
This is gonna be a banger on radio
Love it. I did that whwn my daughter was young. Got down n chucked a tantie with her...ha you should have seen her face
She never fail to us, thanks p!nk
Why did she do this? She's so old and saggy.
I loved it, as always, Pink coming with success. https://media.tenor.com/iLt5Ih_nkz4AAAAM/pink-color-pink.gif
I swear, if I were given the chance to choose the voice that I want for myself, no doubt I'm choosing P!nk's.
You just keep evolving love it. Great concept and so true. Ones got to keep moving, keep dancing for sure we all thank u. Ms. P!nk!!
Childhood love
Why does this song remind me of  what about us  or beautiful trauma   for some reason   it's  an awesome
🔥🔥🔥🎉🎉🎉
Imagine getting paid to be shaken by P!nk.
Maravilhosaaaaaaaaaaaa o pop está vivo
Her voice is so amazing but the pop music she chooses to sing is so bad.  She could have been a legend like Janis Joplin.
Always knows just when to bring it on! So so cool and true to herself!
Goosebumps
LOVE IT XXOOXX
My partner passed away in 2020. He love you PINK!. It was his last seen in 2018. 😔 you’re so much fun to watch. Thanks for remind me of him, my love. 💋🤟
♥️♥️♥️😘😘😘 you're amazing ♥️♥️♥️
Wow! Just heard this for the first time. Had to play it 3x and just kept dancing. LOVE this song. Feel the joy. ❤️
Espetacular muito bom ❤❤ ❤
Already dance to the song from the first listening
It's not even a sad song but why am I crying listening to this??
Start at 1.40sec  https://youtu.be/SNmF7pnfp8E
I'm very happy to be one of the first to listen to this song. I'd like it to be a great success but I also wouldn't like it to be. I feel it's such an intimate and personal song for few people. But I'm sure it will be a great success, and in the meantime I'm not gonna stop dancing to this song!!!
Love
A pure happy song with pure love and happy in each word. P!NK does it again…. And looks like she had fun in each scene of this video. Keep doing what you do, always being yourself and everyone else can…. Thank you for a bit of pure love and encouragement to dance again.
I’m trying so hard to find my smile again and beat depression
This is *awful*
I love this woman so much, the is such a freaking bop!!!
Yeeeaaahh ❤
Bit corny, sorry
She's sounds like Justin Timberlake 😳
I love this!!! ❤️
Thanks for bringing uplift fun platinum youthful music 🎶
she sold her soul for money and fame
That's the best ending ever
Es una muñeca
Pink is a freaking icon!!! Loveeeee
👯‍♀️👏🏼🙌

Such a cheerful & touching song. This is gonna be another P!nk classic.
Thank you for this song, P!NK 💜💜💜 Thank you xo
And what about to do a show in Brazilll 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
She is fierce 💪and her voice unique.
Love Love Love this song
Demonic and evil, I pray you suffer.
It's not a man 😆🤡🤮
Not a smart decision for her to come back with this lack luster lack of effort. RIP Pink.
Esta si que es una muy buena representación de la cultura norteamericana 😁... Me encantas Pink😍. Greetings from Guatemala 🇬🇹🏳️‍🌈
We needed a happy song really bad. Thank you Pink
Her voice is so damn good... its undeniable.. there's a reason eminem spared he back in 2001 and blasted every other pop star
Pink me encanto tanto su energía su baile su letra todo tan perfecto
This is a feel good song fasho🥰
Amazing
Ganda naman ng kantang to 💕💞💓💗💖💘💝
This is terrible. What's wrong with you people.
Yoooo love you pink
Cary Harts wife
Just what the doctor ordered 😊❤ Needed P!nk back in our lives!! 🎉🎉
So you're dancing.
Popular opinion: Pink always create a masterpiece
Since "Missundaztood," my girl P!nk's music has been pretty watered down. I don't get it.
Vc não existe sabia... sempre fazendo a minha música do ano... I Love u
ME ENCANTAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
Essa garota sempre nos surpreendendo e nos deixando muito mais felizes!
Life is so hard right now. I'm trying to simplify things and keep to what brings me joy and do what I can. I struggled though group homes and foster care with the help if Pink. I was little and in care when her 2000 and 2001 album came out and I swear it was my only happiness for 3 years. Seems like I need her again.
Congrats , is been years , I don’t see a fun video like this one , is like 80 videos , I love it😘🇵🇷
This is awful
P!nk you are an icon, my hero, inspiration and a positive role model for those of us young/old. Thank you for being a voice of music which tells a story about my life happy or sad trust and believe. I'm greatful to walk and Jesus takes this wheel prayers 🙏 for future dancing skating and a world of peace
Power of the Phoenix. The ability to rise from the ashes. Renewed strength and power.
love it.
Why im crying 😭
Me encanta ...
My take away is her saying People Wake Up and be alive!
She has done it again!
MY QUEEN LOVE U
wtf.a dance song that made me so emo and cry.😘sooo good
I 💁🏼‍♀️ belong 6ft under ⚰️  The  liberal 🤡s - real life lyrics 👍🏼
just don't know about this Pink person.   Har Mar Superstar is just so much better.
I had a stroke reading that title ngl
Take me back to the 80's
If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb... 👏
I like it.  I do.
Most expensive ADS of )
No fue culpa mía, ni tampoco tuya ! Fue culpa de la monotonía 😂😂
never gonna -no dance again- give you up
That  punk  energy  just like: goo
Love it!!👌💗💗💗
😂❤
P!nk is just amazing and incredible as always!!! F***king Perfect Diva just walt for an LP now thank u p!nk for bringing joy in our life sonc Take me Home!!! Xxxxxx
Thanks a lot P!ink, even though its not my kind of music, i love the point you've set. When I'm out, I always have my headphones on, loud music and dance. I don't care what others think. I don't care if they laugh about me, or whatever.... cause in those moments - I'm free.
There’s this thing called a hit. 🔥
I Loveeeee this music!!PINK,♡
So upbeat and uplifting!❤
woke bullshit.
Hi Ms Pink
Divertido el video, me gustó la canción
Queen never disappoints ♥️
Hi
This is good one Pink. 👍
Oh Girl, I missed you so much!
Okay, Pink.
Love the music. She is a great singer, but the clothes are very bad taste!
Loving it ❤
Not a fan
OBBBSSSSSSEEEESSSSSSSSSIIIIIIOOOOON IS REAL! U LOOK AMAZING!!!! I CANT WAIT TILL NEXTT YEAR!!! ..I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!
Can P!NK actually make a bad song...?   Nope. Impossible.
I love how Pink gives the public exactly what they need at exactly the right time. We need a cheer-me-up song in COVID, she “covers us in sunshine”. We’re not “alright” because human rights are being challenged, she advocates that through her music. We need to get out, dance, and enjoy our lives again and she gives us this banger. A music legend, ❤ Pink
Ich liebe sie einfach seit dem ersten Tag🥰🥰 Sie ist eine wundervolle Person, immer sie selbst geblieben, sieht mega hot aus und hat ne geile Stimme und und und 🥰 Mein Idol einmal im Leben treffen🥰 nur sie!
PINK knows how to make a video! She is MARVELOUS!
So much better AND MORE PASSIONATE than Katy Perry - You GO - PINK!
Y66
i loved this

AMO QUE SIEMPRE ERES TU Y SEGUIRAS SIENDO TU, ME INSPIRAS FELICIDAD Y PUREZA <3

I’m a stronger person because of PInk. Thanks for always being true to yourself and encouraging everyone to as well
It's giving pink vibes ❤️😔💃💃🕺
*Literalmente el 99% de las personas ignoran este mensaje: “Dios guarde a tu familia y a ti de toda enfermedad* 🙏!.
Happy tears. Thanks, Aunty P. 💕
Awful.
oh i like it
This song is a freaking masterpiece like always ❤️ but I want that bodysuit so bad  🥰
P!nk!!! I love this new song!!!
Ameeeeiii esse clipe, essa música, in love ❤️
I want P!nk to give us R&B music tho 😂 love this song
I am 51 years old. i have loved P!nk for many years. she always had a "claw" and her own opinion. she was not and is not afraid of the opinions of others. it's nice to hear (sorry for the words because it's not appropriate for a woman to reprove the years :) ) old with balls P!nk. Do not change
I absolutely love this new sound, it makes me feel happy. After yrs of abuse from my ex this song makes me want to smile.
OK, @P!nk, adding dancing again to my Year 62 list! <3
Allllllll my kids died?????!!!!!!!!! Tooooo saddd u cannnnn imagine???!!!!!’ Dragon 🐉
Although blue acccording 2 some farmers r not my color pink is definitely my color yeahhhh🥰😘😍😗!!!!!!!!!!!
I love the nod to Gene Kelly dancing on roller skates in the movie Xanadu❤
Disco dance.. 70's e 80's are back!! that's cool... ! Love Pink!!
The evolution of P!nk
Good to see you back especially with this track it’s a good one , ain’t been listening to pinks music since “so what” so it’s good to see she is till making tunes.
♥️
I hate a lot of pop music but I have always loved Pink since I was little, she is the greatest person ever <3 and I will always listen to her
She's a superstar, she has a fantastic voice!    🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I'm a heavy hitter/ I get on base/  Traveling at the speed of thought like ultramagnetic on a mantronik bass-line/ Climb, my ladder/  Zoom in while I'm on FaceTime/ Why waste time/ it takes 2/ like Rob Base rhyme/ I'm a heavy hitter/ I'm rounding Third Base  and giving haterz the gas-face/ I'm a "Wild Thing" a wild pitcher while on wild pitch records  Check the box score/ I give y'all the cold shoulder like Mayweather, l box more!
Love the musique and the vidéo veri cool
I've recently had my lower leg removed and I missing dancing alot, even just at home. I can't wait to have my prosthetic fitted and be able to Dance Again. This song speaks to my soul rn. It's encouraging! Thanks Pink
Irrelevant is better
Pink sucks.
Omg i love it!!! Pink your 👏  amazing!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

What boots is she wearing in video at 3:44?
Sonhei que conhecia ela  E cantava com ela numa praça  E ela me corrigia
Love! 🇧🇷❤️
She is such a beautiful woman! I admire her so much, she has always been my idol!!
Lmao getting on the floor with that kid throwing a tantrum is a whole mood lol
My family is already loving this song and I have been singing this 3times today😂😂😂😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍
I love when she enjoy the life
So refreshing ❤️‍🔥
Lol the title reminds me of TAEMIN straight up!
Awww Hell that South Philly woman don’t ever disappoint
Great tune,but a bit like Justin lolx
P!nk had her first hit 22 years ago and to see her evolve as an artist and a person has been nothing less than inspiring. I am still watching her in awe 22 years later and love her as much now as I did then. Whenever I start feeling like shit about myself I think back to a few of her songs and remember she's endured her share of criticism and still continues to be exactly who she is...P!nk!!!
Sooooo good !!!!
I love this!
😍😍😍👍🏽😍👍🏽😍👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
TikTok better get ahold of this & blow it up
My cousin is in that video
P!nk you are Amazing, this is Amazing!♥️👌
Not a great video. Pity :(
Wonderful !!      Amazing!!

I have loved you since the day I heard your song. But them pants... Please change them. I'm sorry just my opinion
Justin Timberlake???😂
That's different.
Thank you Pink, you just made a 61 year old gay depressed man Happy again.  Love you.
This is oddly positive and I like it, pink u never disappoint 😊😊👍👍👍
Love p!nk love this new song just love everything she does and what she believes in xxmwahxx
Completely awfully song....
Everybody’s roller skating now 🙃🛼 #WeBeenOn
There is absolutely no way this woman could know just how badly I needed this video and this message right now!!! SPOT ON  P!NK!❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you!!!!!!!!!!
P!nk, Rihanna... I love November...
I love your songs so much. 🏖❤❤❤❤
Queen! Legend! Icon! 🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳
I wanna see P!nk on Hot Ones!
отварительгый клип. из укрианы с любовью. борат )) шутка
tipical to Pink...body starts dancing without permision
La mejor de todos los tiempos!!!!
The way she tries to potray conservatives is here as fat, fast food and thugish you can not label all the same, some are fit sucessfull buisness folks and healthy as it gets. Just like we can not say all libs are thin and none are white, and all look as good as pink or the girl in the bikkini top. One thing I can say is what both parties completely share in common. The one thing that dumbs us down and divides us is social media and the news and so on. We are Americans from the United States of America. Divided we fall do you understand now? We are United because it makes us stronger having a right or left group weakens us all! At the end when the question comes what do yoi stand for right or left? Choose Love. We will conquere all.
P!nk is my favorite artist!!! She never disappoints with her songs.....I relate to a lot of them. I love how she doesn't care about anyone and is her true self! And she is teaching  her children to do the same. Such a genuine and beautiful person inside and out! Keep being you p!nk.
Never do something that you are not doing, welcome to the matrix
Pink always makes me feel better 💖💖🥳🥳
I don't think anyone else in the world has as much appreciation for diversity, as Pink does and enough confidence in herself to say exactly what she feels at any given moment. I can only hope to one day become, a strong amazing, inspirational, woman as she is!
GOD I LOVE PINK! Welcome back!
I love this so much!  I dance every single day and I’m 61. Pink, love you, your spirit and your music so much!
Love this!  Another great song
Sledeci put kad vidim da je neko iskoristio moj mozak i moj zivot za promociju ovih bolesnika .... Bice mrtav!!!!! Zapamticete me za sva vremena!!!!!
Hmmm...the 2 pineapples are upside down lololol
2Ks vibes 😍

I discovered Pink in college with So What ; she was for me the quintessence of cool and positive craziness. More than 10 years have passed and what a treat to find Pink where I left her in college. This song is a hymn to letting go. What a hit, bravo the artist !
welcome to 2023!
Just waiting for ppl to mess groceries hops up inspired by this song, skate around boys n gals
I like it, thanks for the music P!nk !
This song made me cry my eyes out. True art

🇻🇪 ahahaha años sin ver un video de esta mujer ... esta genial tiene su sello y su estilo sin duda es ella a pesar de los años esta igual de hermosa❤❤
Naja war früher mal besser.
She looks like the female version of Alan Ritchson. They are like twins.
Se a P!NK pegar #1 com essa música em 2022 é a confirmação/comprovação que nosso pop TA VIVO
Pink did it again😊😊😊
She's 43-years old with two children but dresses like a teenager in this video. Still, Pink is super talented and this song hits!! Keep it up!
She took over a whole Gelsons in Studio City.
COME ON <3  nailed it
I expected more from Pink. This album, might be worse than last. I miss old Pink!
Muito obrigada e  Bem dançante  adorei fortaleza Ceará Brasil ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This dancing scenario in the supermarket is maybe possible in America , but not in stock stiff Germany . 😁🕺🤸‍
She's just  awsome always been👏🤗
Yesss 💓
Love P!nk. She always speaks to my soul and she ALWAYS sings the truth. This song is pure joy! Thank you P!nk.

I was touched by your emotional beautiful song!!! great songwriting!!!
Pink is awesome
Love this new song! Great vibes to continue on with life and keep positive 🧡

This type of music is outdated  Specially for amega star like her
Pink is back🎉

Awesome Music,  Fun, Happy Video! Thanks!🙂
LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ♥♥♥♥
P!nk and Jeanette Jenkins reinforce our need to stay active, keep moving, regardless body type, economic situations... We can find joy in the healthy movement...Moving means thriving!!!! I'm still dancing!!!
That 90s esthetic with a new Age twist!! Absolutely love this!!
Love u so much! U rocked, as usual ❤

P!nk o Brasil te ama ❤️❤️🇧🇷
Mid
love it
Me encanta esta canción. Está llena de energía y buenas vibras.🥰🥰🥰🎼🎶🎤
Not a dull moment, as always! 💙💙💙
Tive minha era onde Pink era meu crush, engraçado ainda me sinto do mesmo jeito
PERFECTION
Sounds like something you would hear in the waiting room of a dentist's office or supermarket. It's so bland.
The happiness in this song is something else... <3
I saw you at ACL. You rocked It!!
each song has the essence of pink
Pink! Always unique, fun, great singer and never fail to entertain... Love her since 2000!
I cannot WAIT to scream this out loud in Sunderland Jun 10th next year. Bucket list item. 💜💙💋
I love it!!!
Perfect timing, I so needed this!

Never gonna...   GIVE YOU UP LET YOU DOWN!
Come dancin ! Hag  alt gave yu a invitation
Yeah I thought this was going to be a cover of Careless Whisper lmao
Tazzy already was working at nazzy remember ?
Finally, a song from Pink in a while that i actually like
I appreciate the sentiment of unity and finding happiness being ourselves but this isn’t real life since the pandemic. People are just meaner to other people. Love pink and love the dream but it just doesn’t feel possible right now anyway 😢
why does the video frame looks like it's been squeezed to fit in ? it's painful to the eyes
P!ink 2022 Again
I LOVE you pinkkkkkkkk 💓💓💓💓💓
Is it weird that I laughed uncontrollably and sobbed hysterically through this whole video? Seriously, this is a summary of the therapy I’ve been doing for the last 5 years. I have been knocked down so much and practically crawled through parts of my life, and have done so much personal work to overcome those dark times and dance through life once again. This is the catharsis I NEEDED today. Love you, P!NK.
Such a great song!
💙💚
🛼 🤘🏻 🛼
Why is everything so larry coded, help i'm going insane
Yeah, yeah! Cheers 🍸😁🚬
Love it! Like nearly all from this amazing woman!
Disco is back! Love it!
a beautiful trauma was awesome
Never disappoints
👏🏻 waw, this is a very very positive song. its a hit 👍🏻
not a careless whisper
Parece copia del vídeo de jostin Timberlake de años atrás
Great song from Pink. Truly energetic! Thanks. Let's dance y'all!
dos piñas en el carrito de compras ummmm interesante 😏🤔
This made me happy🎉❤
The way she imitated the girl crying on the ground.. !♥️
Pharell vibes
This song really got me. At first I was just enjoying the music and the beat but then right towards the end, the message kind of hit me like a punch in the chest. "I'm never gonna not dance again"...I've been going through a really hard time lately and I've lost interest in many of the things that made me happy - one of which was dancing. That's what this song is about. It's about not letting the shit that gets you down keep you from enjoying your life and being yourself. I really needed this.
Thank you ma'am! I needed this jolt of joy. ❤❤❤❤
Great music, you always on point
this song is so joyful! I LOVE IT 👏
Waoooo genial.. te amo Pink
Who else think pink crazy..... nevermind
Love, love, love her!!! A class act! Best concerts I ever attended. What an uplifting song. Just what we need right now. She’s such a genius!!💞💞💞💞💞
Essa mulher é perfeita 🇧🇷
🛼🛼💪💙💙💙
I love PINK. I'm always waiting for her new songs ❤️❤️❤️
Pure JOY… Obsessed!!!! ❤❤🎉🎉 Thank you Pink!!!! 👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Watching her dancing takes me back to her old songs and music videos days. Welcome back P!nk!
Watched and heard this just now as it appeared on my YT feed. Idk why but it made me smile and made my soul happy. Thanks, P!nk! 😊
I'm just discovering her and like her so much. She is a great performer. I enjoy watching her and the family....Go Pink🥰😘
Love Pink! Such thirst for life !!
Wow pink ❤️❤️❤️

❤❤❤❤❤
Você nunca erra! As músicas sempre muito perspicazes
Aiii gente, como eu amo essa mulher. Me arrependo tanto de não ter ido ao Rio vê-la no Rock In Rio 🇧🇷

Pink deserves a SuperBowl Halftime show!!! She’s an ICON ✨
This is a  masterpiece ❤️❤️ I love um P!nk!!
P!nk in her P!nk era! Love it 😍
❤️
Rainha nunca decepciona!!!!
She’s not aging so well, looking pretty rough on the edges.  Definitely need to do some rear end exercises cause wearing them shorts doesn’t enhance her curves at all!
wOw pInK is SoOo pRoGrEsSiVe. Make sure to pander to as many issues as you can lmao.
I'm happy that I can see this fantastic woman sing again ❤
Pink es lo maximo la amooooooo
Perfeita 🎉🇧🇷i love ! ❤
She's the original MGK.
Sempre maravilhosa lançando hits com clipes incríveis!!!
Feels so good how most of the 2000s pop girlies like Pink, Avril, Bey, Riri, Britney, Xtina, Taylor, Gaga, Katy, and Adele have released new music this year <333
Amazing song my Quenn,just what we need in these days …love You so much💜💜💜
POP 🍾 🥳 🎋 🎊  🎉
Why can't songs be like 7-10 minutes... is there a version of this at that length?  I'd like to have it
she never disappoints!
0:26 her hands
NICE. by the way who was the guy who was pelvic thrusting at 3:16 ? asking for a friend, the friend being me.
p!nk is my fav...what a sweetie. BADASS WOMAN! EMPOWERING PEOPLE IN EVERY SONG! THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU!
Awesome X
ILY P!NK!! <333
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Oh you know she had fun making this video. She is hands down the best artist in my lifetime. #nngda
This song will be every single dance studio’s recital finale song for 2023 lol!! ❤ absolutely love it
Let’s be honest. P!nk is a complete bigot. Her voice is just her screaming, she is not all that and if you’ve seen it once it doesn’t get any better after that.
Love this lady, always have, always will! ❤
1:22 gen Z
Where's the closed captioning on this music video for Deaf and Hard of Hearing fans? Please add it and thank you #CAPTIONTHIS
🇧🇷🇧🇷🖤
Eu amoooooo 😍😍😍

Yay!  looks like most of us can now agree, 🎶🎵"I'm never gonna wear a maaassskk in a store againnn!!!"🎵🎶 😷👎👎💯🎉🎉🎉
Have to say its different from her usual but I love it what a tune, its been worn out in my house 💃💃💃💃💃💃💃 yet again queen you never disappoint ❤❤❤

You make me smile 😊
Damn, this had me moving around in my bed!! I'M GONNA DANCE BRUH!! 😜
THIS IS SO FUN!!!! WE LOVE YOU, P!NK 🥰🥰🥰
P!nk is probably the most emotionally honest artist out there. Every song feels so personal that even something as "Poppy, bouncy, Happy" as this song can bring a tear to my eye.   LOVED IT!!!!
Good Skater
Queen never fails 🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
Katy Pery song…. Same shit .
Love it ❤️🔥  This woman is really a fucking ICON!!💯
I love youuuuuuuuuu ❤❤❤❤❤
Cool, crazy amazing Pink ❤️🎸
Absolutely joyous!
This is EXACTLY what i needed waking up hung over on a Saturday love you p!nk!!
I love her since 2000 just gets better!!!!!
Pink always makes us move our bodies somehow I love her music!!!!!
thank you pink!
La amo, super linda
I just love how she includes all people from all walks of life in her videos. She has changed so much from her early years and I still love her songs, some with so much meaning. I hope she never changes, except only to get even better.
P!nk never gonna not make a good song.
fun positive vibes and energy....the title of the song just doesnt roll off the tongue right....should of just named it (Im always gonna) "Dance Again" or "Dance Until the End" "Never stop Dancing"
need better video for this music
Muito bom, pink sempre arrasa ❤️
Simplemente adorable P!NK ❤️
Amei essa musiquinha
terrible
Still waiting on that phone call from pink lol love her ❤️
P!nk is always being the sound track of my life. This single is just perfect for this moment. Thank you girl!
wow ❤
Little fat kid is funny
P!nk is the embodiment of a true music artist AND  of a bada$$ woman who knows it but has zero F's to give about what you think about her, and this is why I've been a hard-core fan since her debut. ☺  And is there anything she CANT do?  She's effortlessly rollerskating here 😂   On a side note: I've always wanted to be an extra in one of her videos, they look like so much fun.  And because of the behind the scenes of her mvs I know that she treats everyone amazing and makes sure that they have a great time.  😊
This is so uplifting
She is the greatest!! <3
0:00-1:15
I hate pink. Shades of cool colors are prefed.
Excellent😎
looove this!
amei essa música ❤🇧🇷
P!NK nunca decepciona ❤🇧🇷
Do the youths still say banger? This is that.
This year is really bless with most of my faves singer make their comeback 😍 Taylor Swift, Rihanna, BP and now P!nk 🥹
Fantastic song and love the video thank you pink just amazing ❤❤
LOVE YOU PINK XOXOXO
This will definitely be a hit! Nice one P!NK!!!!! Im never gonna not daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaance againn
She is excellent, songs, music videos, live performances... Pink is the G.O.A.T
i wanna know why selena gomez, meghan trainer and justin timberlake are all in the tags for this video
I love P!NK 💓💞 As always at the highest level with a beautiful voice 🥰
Me ha gustado 💖🔥💖🔥💖
Lol I love Pink 🥰 She’s a rare gem that the world needs 🙏🏾❤️
NUNCA DECEPCIONAAAAA, MARAVILHOSA SOU FÃ
I used to be a dancer. Music was everything to me. Now i have akathisia and seeing fast movement triggers it. I lost everything.
Should have Janet's "That's the end?!" LOL
Love this. I was actually dancing in my local garden centre the other day to Let's Dance, David Bowie. My fav song ever. Life's too short to not have fun 🎉😄
interesting comeback for her...
i'm getting some 2022 'can't stop the feeling' vibes
I am sitting here with the biggest smile on my face.  What an awesome song and video.  Thank you Pink!!  We need more happy in the world right now.  <3
Here watching again and again💕💖
Fun song. Fun video clip! 👏🏻
This showed up on my feed, but pink said not to listen to her music. 😂🤷‍♂️
Whose grandma is this?
So middle aged shite 😂
I didn’t expect something so extremely generic from p!nk
Love it
Yas pink coming through! Bringing better music than the younger artist ❤ Thank You Pink 🎉 🕺🏻
Love it!! Keep rockin🤟🤟🤟🤟
Why does she look like Katy Perry during her flop era 😂
Queen Pink is finally back, another female artist that doesn’t have one bad song.
Love ♥️♥️
Let's Go !  Welcome back P!nk!
Pink never disappoints ! This song is amazing and so is the video ! And made with great sense of humour  as well !
This! ❤❤❤❤❤
The queen Pink is back!😍🤘🏻she never disappoints!🎶🔥
Queen
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Welcome back
This is painful, this is annoying, this is killing me, I don't like him, I don't like them, I don't like them!!  I don't want to Stay here I don't want to see them I don't want that I'm not one of them I'm not happy They say that I'm just a game That's nOt true It's all not true This is not true Please kill me Please don't let me die PleaSe They are everywhere
Hermosa mi amada P!nk, ya necesitábamos esta canción en nuestra vida 😍🕺🏻💃🏻🤸🏻‍♂️🛼🌚
歳を重ねることを恐れず、己の信念を貫く彼女は誰にも真似できない。唯一無二とはまさにこの存在です。
❤️❤️❤️
MYLF
Ohhh  hott cougar😍
This song is so infectious! I’m immediately dancing to this!
Even P!nk can dance. This is cool fusion of rock and dance.
Buying lgbt flag right after shaking some random teenager at work is crazy😭😭🙏
So  are we not gonna address the upside down pineapples  in Pink's   shopping  cart? 😏😏😏
Dancing to this banger in the middle of the night of my 18th birthday with my bestie was one of my favorite moments of the year...even though it's so simple. ❤️❤️❤️ Can't wait to see her live next year!
I love,Pink!
Iconic! I love this song and MV
I swear, "I'm never gonna not gonna dance again!" Thank you 💗💗💗
P!nk is still and will always be amazing! Love her to pieces! Never disappoints!🙌🏾❤👏🏽🔥😃
Omg need to listen to pink again, amazing😍❤

Pink stole my jeans!   As someone with big thighs I hope she single handedly brings baggy jeans back into style 🤣
All lives matter, red and yellow black and white all are precious in God's sight!
Pink for putting a smile from this empowering bliss. Thankyou 💕

Sooo many 90's references & I LOVE it! I miss the 90's
Awww another politically correct song where she loves everything and everyone for more $$$$$$$$$$$$$   Awwww, awwww, pathetic.
Pink gave me music with poetic lyrics to bond with my daughter and is still doing it for the next generation... my granddaughter and I sing and dance to Pink every time we're together

Loved it! Can't stop dancing. 😃😄❤️❤️💜💜💙💙💚💚

She accompanied the video with the message "I just wanna pop and lock to my records. Pre-save Never Gonna Not Dance Again out 11/4"". The single was released simultaneously with its music video co-directed by Pink.  To promote this single, Pink recorded a funny video of herself announcing a new brand of chips, "Vicious Bitches Chips", in a grocery store. In the video she says, "Excuse me, would you like to try a free sample? They're spicy as fuck!" A press release said of the song, "A euphoric and joyful ode to dancing through the hard times."  "Never Gonna Not Dance Again" was produced by Grammy-winners Max Martin and Shellback.            Copyright © 2000-2022 AZLyrics.com

The dancing for the construction worker killed me 😅❤ this was great !
Alexia has obviously been listening & watching K-Pop videos as most of these moves in the blue outfit are from BTS & other K-Pop groups dance practices, the song also sounds very K-Popish so I love it, the lyrics need more work but I understand the message & what she is trying to portray
My ass skid my damn knees bloody roller skating at 35 yrs young. That shit hard as fuck after 15yrs. Ay my feet felt heavy as fuck.😐
I would love to be able to skate around and have fun in a supermarket like that. In reality I would crash straight into the displays knocking everything to the floor and have to pay for the damage 😂
Yeah Pink is back. funny Video
And she is back!!! #Pink
PEOPLE - LET'S MAKE THIS GO VIRAL! She deserves it! ☀️🎉
세상에!!! 핑크!!🎉🥹👍👍👍💕
0:50 that kid got really offended 😂😂
❤️ song
Reminds me of justin timberlakes cant stop the feeling Same vibes here
SHE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT,LOVE THIS SONG AND VIDEO🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Curious to know who's the dancer with long hair and grey sweatpants !
she's just consistently brilliant. always refreshing.
Pink is dead to me since she decided to open up on politics and sh*t on half the country. Be like Dolly, stfu and sing. Keep politics out of you.
She makes fun look so beautiful I love her!
Shouldn't waste food but nice song
Amazing!!!!!!! You rock again!
🙏🏼❤️🙌🏼
♡ thanks Pink 🥰😘 #forever
I love her so much ❤
yeeeeees! let's dancee!!!
The song is such a good vibes
Dreamy kind of mama bear every guy is looking for and terrified of. Waiting impatiently for a new tour.
Pink is always incredible.
SHE IS A LEGEND! When I was 13 years old back in 2001 her Album "Missundaztood" was the soundtrack of my life at the time, it helped me a lot. I can not thank her enough for that.
I love your jeans where I get some XD  I love your move I wanna dance like you again <3
this is a bop! 😍 I wanna see this go number one! 👑
Thought this was going to be a cover of a George Michael song 🙈😅 Missed the NOT 🙄😆
Amazing.
Pink please 🙏 do another R&b album again !!!🎬
Damn She can Roller skate dance too!?
She made my day 5th November ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What for a great Song dear Pink .Thanks for this.
Please stop immediately.
Yess I never gonna not dance again💃💃
Pink 💗💗💗🎶
Just brilliant as always, love her.
That all pretty random but I love it anyway❤
Pink amazing as always. Love this song.
Finally another dance track. Love it!!
P!nk fiel a sí misma y atemporal. Canta, compone, baila, hace acrobacias y tiene un rango vocal increíble y poderoso , además de un directo de 10. No se puede pedir más. Gracias por ser, estar y compartir. ERES AUTÉNTICA.
Just Like Fire, What About Us, Walk Me Home, All I Know So Far and now Never Gonna Not Dance Again. HER COMEBACKS ARE ALWAYS ICONIC. Queen 🤩♥️
Has vuelto a hacerlo. Viendo el clip, de nuevo me he sentido dentro de una pequeña película de la que no quiero salir. Por momentos he recordado Stupid Girls y So What. Menudo comeback más bueno, con tanto buen rollo. Enhorabuena.
Cooool
Ah the Song is amazing 😄.
From now on, every time I enter a market  Me: ~pretends to be Pink in the Never Gonna Not Dance Again music video
🤣  Body like a chubby 13 year old boy.
It made me smile from the very beginning to the end. This woman is amazing, welcome back queen 😍♥️
Never seen anyone in my life try so hard to look tough and constantly sing about getting in fights when she's never been in one. Poser
Sohey Sugihara🕺🇯🇵✨
I like the outfits being a reference to "get the party started"
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wowww I actually love this song I’ve always loved pink she’s always made such good bangers I love this new era that she’s doing in her music too 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
That outfit change was so iconic omg
Still watching here🇯🇵🇯🇵
P!nkp!nkP!nk💕💕💕
Remember kiddos, life is 100x better when you're wearing fishnet skockings and rollerskates and *NEVER* throw away your dancing shoes!!! 💃🕺🏽
So, she cirque de soleil while performing. I can't wait for her to perform this song because I am 100% ready for her to rollerdancing.
I love you Pink since my younger years 🥰🤘🏾💞💞💞
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
I am a fan from the start. She is and will be great.
Satanic.
I hope she never throws away her voice
Brilliant.
Yuck. Disgusting.
P!nk is really one of a kind. She always reinvents herself and her music. I can't remember she ever had a bad single released. They are all good.
I'm also a Lithuanian from Bucks County PA were P!nk grewup so I feel a connection. I'm also gay. I love the support she has always given to everyone.  You never fail to produce fantastic music. I hope to see one day perform in concert. I'm looking forward to your next tour. Great song from a very talented  genius. Love you Alicia!
this outfit, this dance, this voice = this song ❤‍🔥
Thanks for your Art for Me! My Love is near to me! I'm the Autist in Eyed of him! (The-Judith-Eye)

this song brightened up my day and will brighten so much more! thank you
Once again.... the Queen has brought us more joy!! I love you PINK!!!❤
the second outfit!!!! im stealing the idea
I’m sooooo happy we finally get to hear the whole song!!! After hearing you and your kiddos singing the chorus nonstop ❤❤❤
This is how it's done. Perfect!
Love Whitney & Janet ❤️❤️
Perfekt, ideš!!! 👌👍📻💃
I introduced my step daughter to your music, I got sick, Lucy died at age 19 from suicide 2 years ago, your music inspires me, thankyou pink my heart still hearts but you can you take this heartfelt msg I'm alive because of your  music and inspiration thankyou.
Queen P is back! Love you Pink!
👏🏼👏🏼👍🏻
Love her so much! Pop off ❤
Can she please go on your now? 🥹
You can’t not smile while listening to this.
‘Let’s be honest’ comments incoming..
I’ve been following P!nk since There U Go, I love her! She is actual talent with lasting power. Only thing I wish is I wish she’d dye her hair pink more frequently like a throwback 🧡
Very good! Can’t wait for the tour!!
I can't stand this song ... sorry 😔
Man, I love it that she’s not afraid to act silly in her videos. Her personality just oozes through it. Is it me but does She gets younger and younger everytime she releases a video? 😂
The Queen Of Dance Pop Is BACK. Long Live The Queen Of Dance Pop, P!NK!!!
Confused… so is she gonna dance? 😂 love it. Reminds me of that Timberlake song tho.
Love that is is a fast song! Very good P!nk
Not many artist can say they have lived their truth. Stuck to their guns. Have a great career. While working is an industry that is so full of sh**! But Pink can. This kind of music is so refreshing.  The video is cool. It's good to see her in her hip hop mode a little. Haven't seen that from her in a while.
🦖- Theme Song! 💯❤✌  - Great job kid! 👍👍
Fantastica in ogni video musicale a volte seria altre volte esilarante 🏆👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💓❤️📽️📽️📽️📽️📽️⭐⭐⭐⭐🤔🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤😂👍da Tambuzzo Giuseppe di Milano Lombardia Italia 🇮🇹 l'italiano doc

thank you!!!
Love you Pink
that llama though 😍
Sucks!
🤪🤪🤪💕👌💃💃
Good'..
Ameeeee❤
❤️
not sure if the anamorphic was stretched right all the way
This bish told me to go take a hike and stop listening to her music ‘ cuz, well I’ma republican. So Fcuk you Pink.
I am 48. And I got into a car wreck that nearly took my family out!?? In 2019.  By the time I was able to just get a car, and. Enough for physical therapy,!  2020 of March hit. It shouldn’t taken that long
Ayyyye! Another bop to get me thru the rest of the year. You And Taylor got us.
Rihanna , taylor and pink in one week this is my 2000s childhood in a matter of days
It is a double negative. But it kicks buttocks.
Moved me!
I heard some foster the kids on the vocals 😱😱😱
And she delights us again!! I love this woman 🥰
Now she owns every genre of music. A real qween 🥹
Genius film Clip. Love it. Instant smile.
YES MA’AM! NEVER A MISS BY P!NK!!!😭🤩
Love ya ❤
meu único arrependimento foi não ter conseguido ir no show da rainha no Brasil mas ainda vou em um nem q seja em outro planeta
As an English Lit. teacher, I do not appreciate the double-negative insisted upon here. Nevertheless, it's a catchy tune 😊
so let the music play to the end
Why does this song sounds like it would have been produced by the same team as Timberlake's "Can't Stop The Feeling". I feel very same vibe, beats and style here...LOVE IT!!!
Pink was born a male right?
P!nk never disappoints.
She's still got it! 🤘
We don't need anymore dull radio repeat songs like this. Ugh.
Love this song
I’m old. I’m gay. I still wanna marry Pink. I wanna wear her shoes.
Another Pink masterpiece. Thank you.
22 years since her very first music video debut and she still looks sexy and fit AF in this video!!!! BOSS!!!!!
chorus is okay but the rest i can live without, sorry Pink, writing hits take a combination of luck, talent and that special element that is elusive, just ask 99.9 % of all other musicians, especially those without money and connections to promote their music some of which is darned good to.
Let’s be honest it’s kindergarten
I expect better from Pink.  This is just more mindless pop to cash in on the brainless masses.  I'll pass.....
♥️♥️♥️😘😘😘😘
This is absolutely terrible! Just awful
It has been a long time since I heard Poppy dance music
Lllllliiiioooooooooooovveeeeeeeee itttttt😊
Iconic as always 🔥
Amazing that Rollerskating is one of the LESS athletic things she's done.
Nope
Love it! P!nk, you never ever fail to please! Awesome song & funny video = Great entertainment!
This song cured my seasonally affected depression. I'm just gonna play this when ever I feel stressed about the holidays. Thanks pink 🤠
It’s positive
Pink is a legend and yes, bought her very first album and if she can be awesome and real then so can anyone else. ☺️
I don't see it.
Pink is sane. She'll live long
THE QUEEN IS BACK!!!! This is what music is all bout!!!
Great song, as always!!❤
horrrrrible
Alecia Moore is one of the raddest human beings on the planet. If we could all be like her, the world would be just that much better.
Powerful female
Me encantaria escuchar a pink con shakira en una rolita rockera
First time watching the video. Sitting in my bed having a shit day in a shit week in a shit year and this song and video evoked happy tears from me. I felt a love well up in me that felt so good. I love you for giving us things like this. You have no idea how grateful we are to you, Pink. 💜
Nvr gonna dance again huh👀🤩💃🔥
LOVE! 💜💕❤️
I like how they gathered all these not easy on the eyes people. That's one way to make this 40 something woke sagging butt showing has been attractive.
Great vid ❤️
.
The pineapples were a nice touch.
Nice hit and catchy ! :)
So wow… never what I would have expected but talk about switching it up and it’s awesome!!
Shes so cool
Love pink my favorite artist ever and she looks amazing
Oh I Love Wat a Great song 🎉❤🦋🤛🌻😘♥️🎉
Why is this only in 360p?!
This put me all the way back in 1996 at the roller rink with my girls 🥰 Those were the days!  I needed this so much. Thank you 🖤
This song.  After seven years of grief that, at times,  consumed me provides a glimmer of hope.  Thanks. I needed that.
Que venha logo o próximo álbum.
Queen ❤
Love it!!!!
💖
Is that the boy from the Disney Pixar movie "Up"?? My he has grown!!!
I love you so much, Pink. Thank you for ALWAYS bringing a smile to my fave and joy to my heart.  And an extra special thanks for starring my hometowns local apple farms tiktok in this! 💕 It means so much to us from Freeland, MI!
P!nk + the 90s + NOW = EPIC!
My love ❤️❤️❤️
Still got it after all these years
Never gonna not...???
10 de 10 🤩👌🏼✨
Sounds like a song for a Trolls movie.
Pink 💕💕👑💝

Pink, stop, it’s time.
I won't listen to pink.
Love you then even love you now more than ever❤❤
💃🕺💃🕺
Do that Pink !
Again, proving there’s nothing she can’t do.  You are the Bob Dylan of our Generation Alicia.  There is soo much that can be said about you, all very much true and positive, but you already know it all. We love you and we’re all happy to be on this musical journey with you. Thank you for your Music 💞
Hola 👋
Puke is so awesome!!
Pink is never gonna come out as lesbian either 😔
🙉
She did it again!
Perfect timing for Palm Springs Pride day 1 … 🏳️‍🌈 Happy Pride 🎉
Damn that black sheer top. Killing it
I love the lyrics because dancing always makes me feel good
Pink is my B-tch 4ever !
Idk if it’s the hair, makeup, or pants and shoes for me (when she is dancing). 😍❤️
Omg!!!! De vuelta P!nk !!! Eres la mejor hoy y siempre ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I agree every single song she made they are all sounds good never get tired of listening to it.
Those dance moves from get this party started and we gunna start a fight line from so what , that was awesome
Best music
The queen herself has come back & didn't fail to leave an impression. She is the vibe like always.
Best song in forever! This here is real talent! 🎶🕺🏾💃🏽
Why did she shake a 16 year old cashier then steal a bunch of gay flags? Lol
I'm sorry but I was there for the 1999 P¡nk and even though she says making R&B wasnt natural for her, I want that back. I burned a hole in that CD
Can we mention the fact that she looks the same as she did 20 yrs ago (if not better)🙄
I love this song
Reminds me of the 70s Togetherness. Music bought us together....Love You, Pink💖Niceee!!🌊
I wish I had a PINK rhythm🎶 Even better with her singing voice✨✨
The queen is back
Mamy!
this video is so random
ughhhh I love Pink BUT this video is a massive ad.... so annoying

Instant no. Mastering sucks. Can't listen to this compressed mess. Bye.
Eww
Shes alive? I missed good music this makes me think there's hope in the world
I am almost 70 years old and I love to listen to Pink sing. Even us old folks love Pink.  The people in my building say, "There's that old lady dancing in the hallway again"' ..."she must be listening to Pink ". Thanks for keeping me young.
Romanov family.
Even as a child Pink has been the realest to me  100 Peace and Love Stay blessed
Never gonna not dance this song again!
Loveeeeeeeeeee thisssssss 😩😩❤❤
Loving this, even got me feeling like getting up and dancing!
“Let the Music play till the eeeeeend…” 🎉❤❤🎉👸💜💡🦕🥹😱🤓🫶
The diversity of Pink is AMAZING. No matter your ethnicity, she's relatable n everyway. I also love that she releases music at her own pace. Issa WINNER 🏆🙌🏾🤎🤎🤎
This is her best lead single since "There you go." In my opinion. That key change is exquisite and those dance moves are astonishing.
I just danced barefoot. Love the song, love your style, thank you 🤩
I love her
You are my #1 SHERO!! Woohoo great as usual! Love you 😍
😇🥰🌍🌈🌟💖🥳
This day this Legend, this Queen, this Icon - the day Pink - makes a bad song is the day that all of reality dies. She really does amazing work.
Wow. ❤️ I was 14 years old when I first watched your cool music videos, and I so loved them. Now that I'm 27, the vibes, coolness, and beauty of your art are still the same. 🤩 Seeing this makes me feel that your music is always there to make us smile and be inspired. ❤️✨
For years, in my adulthood I’ve been saying “I don’t wanna regret not dancing.” I have too many memories as a teen of being too nervous or scared to dance, afraid I’d be embarrassed. And I’ve never looked back and thought “wow I’m glad I sat and didn’t dance then,” so I decided to dance whenever it feels right. Whether you’re the first on the dance floor at a dead party, or just feeing the moment getting groceries out the car
So how's that Biden thing working?
México 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽espera que algún día lo visites porfa😍🤩
Just love her!
I LOVE YOU P!NK
awesome like always😃
This has a strong hint of Ellen to it!
YES😎
💩
Literally love her she looked like she never aged ❤️🥳
I love this...but just had a leg cut off. So...a little sad, melancholy. I can't even stand.
P!nk sempre surpreendente! Adoorooo!!!
#LOVEP!NK
I love that she has such a banging body and hardly a chest in sight!! Every body type is amazing and should be celebrated! Thank you for always bringing hope without saying it. Always in style even if it’s not anyone else’s style!!
This song will make for a good bathroom break at her concert. As unoriginal and generic as it gets. Made it through half the song.
Good
That was fun. Way to go kid.
This is such a happy feel good song!
I am loving this! I feel like the artists that I grew up listening to are back to making FUN HAPPY MUSIC. we have been missing that.

Fire 🔥 🎉🎉 not going to lie love ❤️ it

The World has certainly not given P!NK the level of respect her talent & hardwork deserves.
Epic!

me when reading the title: 🎶Never Gonna Not Dance Again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool🎶🤦‍♀
more than 20 years on TOP✅🔥♥️Love you  girl♥️
Why I'm..? Food ..🦊
Welovepinkforever ❤️💚💙
Love you PINK!!
Love ya baby
Pink’s songs are always AMAZING😍😮#P!NK is always BEAUTIFUL💖💕
Interesting. In a supermarket.
I love the vibe P!NK is giving off right now. Dance on, queen.
we need this kind of music to get us thru these Dark Ages! let's dance againnnnnn
I need and extended version ❤️❤️❤️🪩🪩🪩💃🏼🕺🏻🌈🌈🌈🌈
Still hitting like the star she is. Been loving her for 20 years. Have seen her a total of 7 times . ❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰
Honestamente no es bueno , falta algo más de creatividad de los productores... Es buena la idea pero usar la nostalgia de los 90s y 2000s no funcionó.  Regular 💁‍♂️ 6
them jeans took me back to high school... lol
Estava com saudades Pink , te amo
Different sound, still good though
Love it
!
I just heard this ong for the first time, and I love it! It has a 70s feel to it in the best possible way! 🥰

Similar to her first song I ever heard from her: Get this party started, loved her from that beggining 🌈🙂
It's amazing see you again! We need you, we loooove you! <3
Pink es como la Maná de las pop girls ja ja ja. Sacó justamente lo que esperaba que iba a sacar. Igual es un bop 🥳 🥳 🥳
Pink 🌸 Siempre con esa energía y carisma ❤
I do not even give two shits that this is a tacit ad for Instacart. Girl slays!!
Now let’s play careless whisper. “I’m never going to dance again…”
Oh and I love the roller skates 🛼 it totally came to together ❤😅💯🥰💃🏻
This is some crap
Iba distraída y pense que era algo de Taemin por el never gonna dance agaian pero vi bien y era Pink y le faltaba el not en el medio jaja. Por cierto buena canción Pink ♡ como siempre
I love you Pink! You were my first and only concert I went to! ❤🎉
P!NK大好き！！　元気になれます！！

Maravilloso
#AlwaysP!nk❤️🌟🦋

Supperr loveee it!!! Pink you're the best! I hope the day will come you'll have a concert here in the Philippines! Love you! #SolidPinkFan
P!NK does it again and again🎉 love her
Thanks for that message, I don't think I want to not dance again either
If I could be anyone in the world, I would be PINK‼️❤️
Sencillamente un excelente tema. Distinto a lo que hemos oído de ella. Pronóstico que será #1 en Billboard Hot 100 y en otros países. Es el regreso de pink como debe ser.  Muy pronto será un himno que retumbará en cada rincón donde se escuché. Muchas bendiciones para Pink y que venga más música, para que nos siga alegrando la vida.
Sooooooooooo Pink! Luvya!
😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤💞
Can't Stop the Feeling!
I noticed those Lollys. I have the same pair. I love the song.
Is this a sign???? I must go back to roller skating again. It's been years, I maybe rusty but. I'm feeling inspired ✨️ 😊
Just the usual standard of musical content....  Absolutely fantastic sums it up!  The hits just keep on coming...
Pink rocks. Pink is amazing
It's like who needs Yankovic when you parody yourself better than anyone ever could? Fun 🙃🙂
DON'T MAKE ME CRY, P!NK 🥺
Amo a esta mujer 💕💕

One talented young lady.
amazingly entertaining and enlightening.  my best friend's new quote is, "We have to seek supreme hope."  Lately, i've been seeing many great videos on YouTube and P!nk added to the momentum that is rumbling in youth culture. Awesome.
😍😍😍😍😍
Absolutely love it ❤
I am sitting here with tears running down my face.  I needed this so much!  My husband died 7 months ago and I'm about to move to assisted living.  I love this song and you!!!  Thanks more than you could know.

Please someone tell me what her jacket says on the front. Love is …..
Goddamn I LOVE HER
Longevidade amores a P!nk segue passando por décadas e nunca erra!
Yessssss!!!!! I needed this!❤️❤️❤️
For the thousandth+ time ..  NEVER disappoints 🥰🥰😍😍
Pink music always gives me confidence I love her so much. Her music helped me come out to my family her music helped me get out of a toxic abusive relationship. She’s just an amazing person and I wish only the best and all the love to this her.
This got me moving and when is she going do contact again
Just be excellent to each other. ❤
#FJB
Goddesses how I love you p!nk, it's a Friday I listen to your music, I can tell nanana it's a game I don't want to lose

🙂
❤ this song & 💖 P!nk
Pink ilove you ♥️💋❤️🙏🙏🙏😍😍😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳

PINK 😍 thank you !
No kidding…. P!nk literally helped me through every rough stage in my life where I felt so broken down. And once again she’s just in time. Dealing with grief and heartbreak….. Thank you Alecia 🙏❤️🙏❤️ I really needed this revival
Dang she can kinda skate though!
Loving this ❤️
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
All of the outfits in this video are amazing and I legitimately love each and every one. Wear what you wanna wear. Be who you wanna be. Dance how you wanna dance.
I wanna like this. song so bad...
"Got Zero Fucks" PERFECT !!!
Bravo❤
Pink is absolutely legendary. Coming from a black guy
I'm a conservative type. Is it OK that I watched this?
This gave me some Jessie J vibes, love this
Most fun video ever. The song is the greatest thing ever too. They are just so much fun. ❤
how did you make pretty people ugly?
P!nk casa vez mais maravilhosa, cada vez que ouço essa música me pego dançando seja onde for. Aí para não ouvir sozinha tiro o fone e ponho no volume máximo e continuo dançando 😉.
I liked her hairstyle. I can go for it. I do have short hair that needs a hair cut.
Thank the Universe for Pink
Wow love it, welcome back P!nk, missed ya girl
this sound is so nostalgic to me. im so happy to see pink making music🥹💖
Hi mom 💕💕💕💕💕💕 keep reminding me who I am 🌹🌹🌹🌹
Tudod mit Mama? Ezt hallgatom majd szülés közben😅🥰😊😘
Great great positive vibes 🙌
Pretty poor tbh
Pink ne déçois jamais ❤️
The park scene reminds American Pie by Madonna
Finally!!!!! Thank you 😊 💓
That voice IS ICONIC!
She is back and never disappointed
EXACTLY how I feel.
I am 60 and still dancing to Pink! Lets dance and keep on dancing! Keeps you young and happy.
Perfect lyrics, great MV! Can't wait to see this performed on tour! Thanks
I can’t stop watching this video! I’m obsessed!!!
She destroyed the song name 🦉
LOVE IT! thank you for making better my day
Super 🎤🎼🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥

How she just coasts on those skates.  Is there anything she can't do??
THANK YOU. MY ANTHEM FROM NOW ON. Spent 7 to 10 years recovering from injury and depression and NOW IM NEVER GONNA NOT DANCE AGAIN. NEVER GONNA LEAVE MY DANCE SHOES! Regaining my dance career is the best reward.
Girl !! You are happiness!!
One of the special artist in the music business, welcome back P!NK ❤
Kinga
Pink is back!!!! 💃💃
EU AMEI 🇧🇷🥰🇧🇷🥰🇧🇷🥰
yeah, you're back girl!! funny, i was talking to my older sister bout u on Wednesday .. we need your comeback song and now our wish come true!! ❤
Great song! She has the trick of continuing to evolve in a way that feels really authentic. I see a P!nk recognizable from who debuted in 1995  here, but I also see all her development.
❤❤❤
Great song and video 👏🎵💃🎉🎶  I want to dance with you @pink, sometimes, I dream 🙏 To dance is my life 💃🩰 since 55 years.
Long live the queen!!💙
Look how good she looks
Is she wearing Mugler ?
The message in the song gives me total modern day Britney vibes! 👏
I'm gonna try this in Walmart tomorrow. Wish me luck!
I love it, definitely one of my new favourite songs 😊
She is awesome! She looks hot in those loose jeans!!! ❤
She is so awesome 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wouahhooo !!!! 😍 Absolutely irresistible !!! It's therapeutic for morale !!!!! 🤪 Thank you so much, Pink !!!! 🙏💋
Rainhaaaa que só faz música boa ❤️

Woo una reina pink me encantó ❣️🥰🤘🤭💯💥💗💘
"People of Walmart" video

♥️ 💃
I AM LIVING FOR THISS!  Pink never dissapoints
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Podemos hablar de cómo P!nk ha logrado convertirse en una PopStar atemporal 💓
My friend was in this video
When I first read the title of this song, I thought Taemin had a new collab with P!NK.... 💀
Luv it
Love it
A MAIORAL ❤️

Amei❤🎉

Ta no repeat aqui!!!
Meh 😒… I’m not that impressed. Something about It isn’t quite clicking for me. I don’t know what it is… Eh maybe it’ll grow on me.
L💗VE
Can't stand her.....a hypocritical Prima Donna!
I love the absolute joy in this song and video.
Her daughtie at 0.56?
The retail workers gonna be bumping up and down the aisles with this soon
❤
This song is just pure fun. Something we all need right now. You’re the best P!nk
Nunca decepciona, a alegria esta de volta.
She is crazy
Love it!!! 💟💟
😍😍😍😍😍😍la amooooooooooooooooo 🥰🥰🥰🥰
PEACE 🕊️
I love Pink! But this song recalls me strong on Justin Timberlake - Sunshine in my pocket. Even some dance moves :/
You never disappoint! Love ❤️ it!
Love Pink ❤️
If someone told me that the world would end tonight You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love  But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance) I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun  'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancing shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry Know that I'm starting a fight  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, yeah, d-d-d-dance  I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry You know that I'm starting a fight (Fight) I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time We've already wasted enough time  I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (hey, hey)  Never gonna not dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again Let the music play 'til the end Dance again Never gonna not dance again Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Let it play yeah Dance again (Never gonna not dance again) Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end) Come on, come on (I'm never gonna not gonna dance again) (So let the music play 'til the end) Yeah, yeah I'm never gonna not gonna dance again So let the music play 'til the end
When I posted this video to my social media, I said this: "I think I have a new anthem! P!nk is one of my favorite singers and I just heard this for the first time. I love it. I interpret 'I'm never going to not dance again' as a metaphor for living life to the fullest, for living as exactly who we are, for not giving a f*ck what others think of us. Enjoy. P!nk is a music goddess."
Alecia genius strikes again.  And Alecia ... 🤩😍😍😍❤❤❤
thank you P!nk
I love this so much ❤❤❤❤
Pink, você é necessário mulher
Give me ROCK P!NK !!!PLEASE!!!
Here before 1 million views gang ✌🏻:

👏🏼
🔥
This song was written for my Madison, my angel 😇 ❤
i thing somting wrong  about  accept ratio
Love it!! Such a fun video ❤️  🛼  🛼
This makes me wanna start rollerskating again!🙃
Because we have to pay for everything in life, are not compensated correctly so people feel dead inside. Life is not fun for most and it should be
pink on dem moxi skates got me feeling so happy
😍❤
Kind of reminds me of her old songs.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
P!nk with her music and attitude really touches me deep and makes me believe in humanity again every time. She’s so genuine.  Everyone, just dance to your own beat. We all deserve this! ❤
Dance baby 🩰
OMG  its the oxxo kid of the meme   :)
Love Pink in so many ways but gotta say that second outfit makes me want to update my CLOSET. My gosh it's SICK! Fun tune :)
P!nk só tem música boa!

ice cream sandwich sitting down in a grocery store aisle listening to music, dudes living like Larry
❤❤❤❤❤
joyous!  thank you
I’ve loved P!nk since day one!! And the fact that she mentioned my Whitney Houston in this song is just everything!!!
Album filler at best !
this is such a bop!
🙂
Maravilhosa PINK você não decepciona nunca que ritmo gostoso de ouvir amei essa música 😍💖
THE IT GAL
Every P!nk song is a masterpiece!
Sweet ♥️
Lmao I remember Pink made a statement about pro-lifers to fuck ooff and stop listening to her music. Personally I separate her music from her and still enjoy it.
J'adhereeeeeeee !!!!!!!!! 👍🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
🙏🙏🙏🙏
i love pink.
WTF is this shit?
I love all of your songs!!!
New fear unlocked: getting P!nk-rolled
Love the song.. but that is a LOT of Instacart ads
Is it just me or has this song ( structure and breaks ) and video ( setting ) massive borrowings from Justin Timberlake - Can´t stop the feeling ? EDIT: Okay, same songwriting team. Some leftovers.
Love it!
Isso foi de 0 a 100 muito rápido
P!nk is always so good. I love both the song and video.
This is horrible
Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this song. We need positive songs in this world.  Greetings from The Netherlands. XXX!!!
What a beautiful message <3 & Pink looks hotter than ever!! :)
Por fin , me encanta
Groovy 🎉 ❤P!nk ❣️
Mgt is evil!
wonderful clip music
This song is so fun. I needed a pick me up and this did it for me. It had me dancing!
💜
Oh Pink, I'm never gonna not love you again! I FUCKING LOVE YOU, YOU LEGEND🎧🎵💃🏻
pink used to be attractive poor carey hart
*round of applause*  👏
🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://youtu.be/-i5dRvaKj4w
Struggling to stay relevant is painful
I hope all y'all realize we're blessed enough to be living during the same music era as one of the greatest artists of all time: P!NK!!!!
Queen Pink is back! ❤🔥🔥
Amazing! Can’t wait to see her again next year 🎉
Pink nunca defrauda... Gracias por tu energía, tu sentido del humor y esa voz inconfundible ❤️
P!NK vamos dançar juntas? Please?
I love how her music always has an insightful and empowering message. Since back in the day her lyrics are always on point. Thanks Pink
This is why we love you!!!!! The uniqueness, the charismatic, the attitude, everything!!!!!
“CAN’T STOP THE FEELING!” song and video have now a twin brother.🙈
I love her voice… not a lot of her music.
Fab!
Anyone who says she is too old to be doing this or dressing like that needs to just stop.  She is gorgeous and so talented and can do whatever she wants. She is an icon and a great influence and inspiration.   You dont like it?  Thats fine. Love more and judge less. ❤️🌈❤️💗😘
This song was amazing. Can't wait for your AMA performance.  Brazil loves you ❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Never gonna give you up
Welcome Back Pink! We've missed you! Love this single! And I will keep on dancing!
I loved it! 😍
Je l aime , elle est sulfureuse
Hey baby....hey P!nk thank u baby i feel so alive 🙏❤
SHES BACK!!!!!!
👌😊💐💕
We need another rock opera. Led by this Queen.
Welcome Back Queen !!!!!
I love that Pink si releasing new music. She's part of my childhood.  Also from the title for a second I thought she was gonna sing an iteration of Careless Whisper "i'm never gonna dance again..." lol
She Never missed a single song!
I’m so fucking early
director: what do you want in the video? p!nk: everything ... and lama <3
Love, love, love PINK!
Wow, this is so brilliant, catchy and that's a whole new side of P!nk, as well. She makes it look so effortless. Very well done!
Sorry.. but not
Amei!!!
I love P!nk, I really do, I've been following her for so many years now, it's just that at some point, seeing her physically abuse people in her videos is not cute or funny, it's just violent. Yes, I know it's not real, I know that's her thing-being bold and honest, doing whatever she wants, but it's just got old for me. She can deliver the same exact message without punching/shaking people in every single video.
LOVE!❤
no matter what I will always be dancing
no matter what I will always be dancing
Pink é uma deusa...
Nie nie nie ! To nie Nasza ❤️ Pink!
She's definitely very cool without even trying it
Totally not sponsored by Stouffers lol, cant hate tho they are pretty good
Love it Pink!  Thank you! 💞💞💞
Thanks for the reminder to keep being whoever the heck you are and keep dancing and living! ❤❤❤
HFK - kids flop version
I'm NEVER gonna doubt a new P!nk song again!
Boss
Love it!! 😍😍😍 See you next year in Cologne 🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳

Her stuff is sounding all the same at this point, I love her old stuff
Thanks for this new great song❤
Oh look! It's P!nk doing P!nk things! Get the party started!!!
Minute 2:40 = Germany 😂😂😂
Excelente canción de Pink, de este 2022. Está si es buena música, no porquerías de Los Bukis y OV7, grupos de conflictivos y mediocres, que ya deberían retirarse. Bienvenida, Reyna Pink!!!!  La mejor exponente del Rock actual en Inglés y de todos los tiempos.
A bit old to be dressed like that
Omg, how much we love you P!nk 🎯 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤
It was about time Pink started dancing again! I am still waiting for the sequel to her iconic first album! Babyface, Jimmy Jam and La Reid must be on board.
The fact that she is in her 40s and still looks like she's in her early 20s is amazing
🇳🇬🇳🇬
P!nk is back! Like old Times
❤❤❤
cool
what a banger!
Thank you for bring us good and simply pop in a time where you only listen urban styles which I like, but we need more pop as this one
💖...
SO FING HAPPY LOVE HER FOR LIFE !!

A música acaba e logo já vem a vontande de ouvir tudo de novo! Refrão contagiante, ritmo alegre e a letra traz uma boa reflexão. Gostei muito também da menção a música da Whitney Houston! (I Wanna Dance).
This is ICONIC! P!nk just never disappoints.

I missed you ❤
Literally my favorite since I was 12 ~ 21 years and counting loving you P!NK!
I love you & I appreciate the last 2 decades of your music & vibes so much. Thank you for being everything you are. This song is a jam & a great reminder
Never fails to cheer us up! Brilliant. Thank you!
Tbh this is the first P!NK song I haven’t enjoyed
Mahalo Nui Loa, P!nk.
I’ve been listening to P!nk since I was a kid, and honestly I can’t thank her enough for making me who I am today!
Seeing her perform "Baracuda from Heart" at the Taylor Hawkins tribute concert really made me appreciate her capabilities.
Love P!NK🤩👍
Of course not cause she’s Hella rich and the more music she makes to dance to the more money she makes
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah que HIT deliciosoooooo 😍😍😍
this is the kind of vibe i need rn
Literally an anthem for the Karens of our society. What's with Pinks need to be biracial?   Way too much bronze tanner.
💖💖💖💖💖💖
Can't wait to see the 2023 Summer Carnival!!
💕💕🛼🛼
Ok cool song but ENOUGH of these 80s kind of sound, it’s been 6 years since E-Mo-Tion by Carly Rae Jepsen and Witness by Katy Perry came out and since then we’re all vibin’ on the same beats
❤😂💘
P!nk I love you demasiado!! 😭💖
I was waiting for a possible shooting.  Thank God Pink turned it and made it all alright.  🤗
nice vibing song, but for me the songtitle and how it is pronounced in the song disturbed my ears...for me it dont fit . i know what she want to say behind the words, but it really sound akward for me. Sure i will see her on Tour next year, think for the 5th time, so i am still a fan- dont get me wrong
💘💘💘
Love it!!!!💯❤️
Is it just me or is this video music dark it's not like it used to be when it was fun and colorful
FINALMENTE 🤧❤️❤️❤️❤️
<3
Another Hit!!! Always a great message and Vibe!!! Thx for all the love you gave us and to make this planet a better place🎶🎤🔝👑🎉⛸️👏🤩😃😍😊🔥🥰👌💓😉
I needed this, honestly I almost unalived myself today, thanks x
❤❤❤❤
I love you p!nk
I really hope she has a new album soon
Siempre tan original y bella PINK, sus videoclips son garantía de pasarlo muy bien. Dios te bendiga mi bella PINK, te amamos  y admiramos por millones!!!👏👏👏👏🤗💖🙏💖👍😘🇵🇪 PLEASE, VEN AL PERÚ, TE ESTAMOS ESPERANDO CON MUCHO AMOR!!!.🙌🙌🙌🤩
i resonate with the lyrics! let's be good again, let's not stay stuck!
I don’t think I like this song
Podría estar mas enamorada. Respuesta rápida, No 😍 💘
Double negative....
Para cuando una colaboración con Shakira??!! ❤
Cannot wait for the tour to see this performed! The confetti, the colour, the costumes, I can picture it already! 💓💃
P!nk is my spirit animal. Love her so much.
amo a Pink
Very good, I'm thinking about becoming a fundamentalist Baptist after I'm done with the vampires
Love it!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cette chanson respire l'esprit positif j'adore 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿✌🏿✌🏿✌🏿💪🏿🎉 J'adore cette artiste

It's true Pink never disappoints
The theme and the music are such a throwback to earlier years and it's almost like a part two to Get The Party Started 🤩
Clipe bem do jeito Pink de ser s2
Love it ❤❤❤❤❤
Eres Única😍✌️🇨🇴🇨🇴
Another master piece
I love her music 😍
This is why I love Pink,
If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.Romans 10. 9-10  so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.Hebrews 9. 28
Pink is my forever Punky/Hiphop Queen!!!!
Te amo mucho 😻 pink contigo me siento viva y capaz de enfrentar los problemas no soy rara soy auténtica que viva la variedad de personalidades en este mundo eres increíble y te amo❣️

M.I.L.F with good music
She is back and better than before ,double hip replacements and happy to show nothing can slow her down ,20 years of amazing music and hopefully she never stops. Love this beautiful woman.
I swear lyrics for music is just so horrible. Everything about it feels so lifeless.
🌈💕💕💗💕💗💕💗💕💗
Maybe Shakira and P!nk were in the same supermarket and they didn't even know😅
the song is okkish but the music video and Pink dancing is Amazing
Just make a Rock Album already. You're voice was made for it.
💞
Buena rola como siempre!!.. De pink no se espera menos!!.

Thank you for give us the BEST SONG EVER ♡♡♡♡♡
Sometimes I feel like throwing away my dancing shoes for good. This song motivates me to keep dancing regardless of the obstacles that may come way way.
Love P!NK!!!
muy lindo
Our Queen  is here! ❤️
I'm 38 and have been in love with Pink since age 17. She has never disappointed with her music...such a beautiful and talented woman.
Always have loved Pink, this will have to grow on me , sorry..

Boomer music
🛼 🤘🏻 🛼
Just watched the new Rihanna single, with all due respect, i felt really desolate. Watching this immediately after, back to back, my faith in humanity is restored. ❤️ always.
Every roller skaters dream to shop with skates on! Pink Nailed it! 🛼
Eu gritei: Rainha.
I commented so that I can say "I was here!" 😐
rollerblades, boob tapes, instacart, instagram, granny pants and big granny shoes is back in trend? WHOA
💗💗💗💗💗💗
Yaaaaaas pink bringing real music back again 🎉

OMG! Amazing ❤❤❤, Love you pink!! 😍
Yyyyeesss bring it PINK!! I LOVE THIS!  THIS VIBE DEFINITELY NEEDED IN THE WORLD RN!!👏👏❣️  I'm loving the old school pink looks in this...she gives me vibes from the oldschool Pink..  like from the "there you go" era 💕💕
Nice bop.🎶
This girl scares me in a good way. Like she looks so powerful and confident. She gives the impression she can rip 3 burly men apart.
Wow...geez every single song she comes out with is perfect and can yank anyone out of a bad moods :0) !! Thank you pink !
And Pink, you have done it again❤❤❤❤❤
❤
❤️🎉💥👏
What a woman. 😍
Never gonna NOT dance again!
Is my perfect Birthday song. Thank you Pink I Love you 💕  My Birthday is November 5th I will be 52 years old but never felt that age it just seems very strange when I look at a mirror lol. I am going to Dance now ❤️🧡💛💚💙
I will pray for pink and all lost celebrities ✝️🙏
Welp, this new song and video just made me forget who I was for a minute or two. It’s so good that I advice you to get a permanent marker and jot your name on your forearm before you take a gander. 😂   It took me an hour to get through it because I popped it and locked it, paused it and stopped it. Then rewound it and snapped every itty bitty inch of it. It spun me around and it spit me right back out. It hung me in reverse and stung me where it hurts. It swung me over here then it threw me all about. I forgot who I was, so that’s a hit, no doubt!   GREAT JOB @pink, cast and crew! You outdid yourselves through and through.   This is the one that won.   ~jb
Eu amoooo 😍
Just Pink being unapologetic herself ❤, playing in her own league, giving 0 f#cks about trends, charts, doing something different, etc. You go girl 🥳
Perfeita demais! 😍
Almost the same beat as Can't stop  a feeling by Justin T
Hahahahha nunca decepciona! Que pegada Stupid Girls! Amo essa dancinha dela! 😍
Queen is back
My queen
Take my dog 😢😢😢😂
I Love so much
All of the pineapples, I love her
Love this lady❤
Cool song 🔥🔥🔥
Love the roller skates great song I'll probably be dancing and singing in my car for weeks to it
Instant favourite! ❤
Whomever thought of this concept for the video. IMO simply brilliant!!!! 👏👏👏 Another amazing song for Pink's collection!!! 👍👍💞💞
Heart Anthems are what Pink is known form. Rock on queen
😍🤗OMG Pink never disappoints. She is so original and genuine. I love this. This is my anthem... I'M NEVER GONNA NOT DANCE AGAIN. I LOVE YOU PINK!❤💓💗💓💗❤❤💗💖💖💕❤ THANK You for blessing me with this song.
Im inlove with this
This is so very modern Disco
Amazing
I cried 💜💜💜💜
I remember hearing her singing acoustic and thinking "wow her voice is so special". Such a shame she wasted her talent by singing basic dance pop commercial bullshit. She would have been a great rock singer had she not sold out.
ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING AWESOME SAUCE!!!! BUT THEN AGAIN HAS SHE EVER PUT OUT A BAD VID??? HELL NAW SHE HASN'T CUZ SHE ONLY PUTS OUT BANGERS!!!!!
I love her so much, so talented ❤
Pink. que ter um poder de persuasão significativa demais porque não gostei da música mas ela conseguiu me prender  fique até o final do vídeo
👌🏼💯too good!!!❤
You are my idol Slaying Queen! Please keep inspiring and living your life with such strenght
핑크 사랑해❤
Thanks to this song I want to continue living ❤
Made my day🎉. Love it❤.
Why am I crying!!??!!
And I'm never gonna not love you P!nk!!!!! I love who you are even more than your music. I've watched you & wanted to be just like you since I was a little girl in middle school. At 30 yrs old, I still do lol. Love you girl!
Not the tan and urban look 😂 I see you pink . They sure know what to use to sell
Why are pride flags being inserted into so many tv shows, videos and commercials lately?  Show you that just a few control the narrative.
So What! Part 2 🥰
good music, too bad you make a political statement for LGBT (LGBT) flag in the video. It is up to everyone to treat it with respect. They want to be treated normally, so act normal! Straight people don't just ask for straight parties/activities. Respect each other's orientation religion origin that makes life a lot more pleasant. Do not participate in the 2 division that the political persons are going through. to gain total power over humanity. Peace to all!!
最高っす
queeeeeeennnnn 🗣️
SUPER 🤩😍💥👏🎤🎧🎵🎶
Fabulous darling

The Feel Good Song right at the end of 2022 is what we need right now. I also love the Whitney Houston reference in your song: "I wanna dance!"

This resonates. Love it!

And i maked 10 homeworks with my favorite singer and that is u.
Disco shopping mall...i am like Add🌺🌸
Toujours au top 😍😍😍
I miss the old songs from pink like so what, sober. Why doesn't she make music like that again.
I am SO SO SO happy right now after watching this video. P!nk is my queen and I've been obsessed with her since her very first single ever dropped and her music is always just amazing!!!
P!nk is the absolute greatest.
Magnificent   as always, 😇🥰🇬🇧
I just love you! It’s that simple. You are kind and beautiful.
P!nk and Lady Gaga are the two singers I have never stopped listening to. They keep it real and relatable, and they have so much talent. I truly respect both of them.
I LOVE PINK!! ❤

This reminds me of a song Katy Perry would do. I hope P!nk’s next album has more edgier songs than this.

I Love you since i was 12 and sang "you make me sick" with all the rage  ,my first favorite singer and idol 💕
I am so down right now and this song changes my mood☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
P!nk arrasou não só na música, como no clipe! Percebo uma era mais vibrante e alegre, se comparada a outras passadas, mais emotivas!
P!NK IS A TRUE ARTIST 💕
i missed her
Oh my gosh! I live in Slab City, CA and I’ve felt like I’ve been struggling lately……until I woke up to this this morning!!! I have to be out of my home and live in my van until I find a new place to be by Saturday and I was feeling some sort of way about it. THEN…this song! I’m going to be performing/dancing to this tomorrow at THE RANGE where people come and share their talents. I’ve never heard this song before and it gave me so much hope!!! I’m fricken stoked AND it’ll be recorded LIVE at sundown. Please watch and play with me!!!
I vote Republican and I listen to all Pinks music and I love it and love her!
Great tune and an amazing video. Still, the ultimate super market themed music video is this Jane's Addiction's gem from the early 90s.. https://youtu.be/jrwjiO1MCVs
te amooooooooooooooooooo
Justin Timberlake called and wants his song back
Gute Laune Musik 💃💃💃🌹🙏👍cooles Outfit 🙏

What a disappointment!!!!! This woman has always been a legend in my eyes...!! Some of her music have been the most inspirational, life lessons music!!! NOW THIS SH*T!!!  What is shame.. I really wish people would keep the politics out of their music as far as I'm concerned pink can take her pride and trans flags and put in her ASS!!!! ANOTHER ONE BITS THE DUST!!!

I remember when Pink used to release good music. Her first two albums were insanely good. Now she only drops mall music. A shame.
I like the part where she dances and sings
I hope this song will bring pink back at #1 bbhot100

Goodmorning happy friday tgif cheers🍻🍺🍹🍸🍷🍾🥃🥂🍻🍺🍹🍸🍷🍾🥃🍵
I got my first album with P!nk in 2001 and I haven’t stopped loving her since then.
P!nk never makes good music anymore she used to have awesome danceable songs now her music is just boring and too sentimental   Old school P!nk come back!
the denfinition of fun is this song
I stopped dancing since I moved to Australia as a international student but I’m gonna start dancing with this song again❤️❤️
MAYBE PINK SHOLD BE IN THE BAND OF SILK SONIC
Thanks for coming back and boosting our self-esteem once again, Queen ✨
I'm not real into p!nks music but this was phenomenal.
Let's GO ❤️‍🔥👯
Fantástica como siempre!
Let's be frank...P!NK is everyone's girl crush, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity lol. Oh man, what I would give just to meet her and give her a hug and tell her how fucking RAD she is. Or hell, even just to be able to go to one of her concerts. I'm 32 now and grew up on her music. Maybe someday I will be fortunate enough to meet her, but until then I will continue rocking out to her music online. Idk if she ever reads these comments, but if so I just want her to know that she is a legit role model for me, and that growing up a shy awkward gay trans kid, her music helped me find my voice and helped me learn to be comfortable and confident in my own skin. If you ever see this, P!NK, I love you! Thank you for teaching me how to love myself and being a positive influence in my life❤
Love it,still love your style and your ever so gorgous
love this!
Let's make it the number 1 video on youtube.
Girl! You just give me life.
The best 😅
I LOVE HER R. ON THE FLOOR
this feels so goooooooood to my boddddyy
Something New from P!nk ..
ameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeei
I LOVE HER  EVERTHING
the „good mood booster“ of the year
It's really good to see p!nk back, and making the type of music that she makes and we love 💕
💙
She is the gift that keeps on giving
Yay! I love it. Dance it out people!
Hey, this was really good and I much enjoyed the video  ❤
Le faltaba a P!nk entrar en la onda Disco 🥰 espero sea una buena era
Inviting all of us to make the choice to be happy and "dance" in the very place that causes us stress, a grocery store with its empty seccions and high prices. And inviting others to join in our happiness....I ❤️ ypu Pink.
I have been a P!nk fan since she first came out and I have to say she keeps getting better over time.
I will always love this Queen 💚
A song with deep meaning… love this! I love pink too! ❤
Perfection - again.
All I can say is P!NK has done it again. Every single song she creates is a bop. I absolutely love her and hope to meet her one day
Another bop! I'll be replaying this for awhile! 🤩
Looks like an old lesbian
Mais quel clip! Et quel classe! Queen mama le retour!
worst Pink song to date.
Ok. How did I miss this? It's a Bop with an old school feel. Love it!
❤
After all this years you still can make everyone through your music feel this energy, younger and bright inside. Love u P!nk ;)
what a stupid song Don't tell me she's starting to go shit too we ve lost too many good artists selling out and just producing crap for money and let downs Big thumbs down from me
Beautiful!!! what imagination for that video!!!
I needed this song!! Feeling like I am losing my mind with the hate in America! Then pink comes and reminds me I’m never going to not dance again!! Love the woman and genius you are💙💙💙
YES! More happy and uplifting songs! This is what the world needs!! NO MORE Drama, Sex, dark songs. Good job Pink
🥰🥰
The World ain't gonna end, you can free yourself from that idea when you heal your heart.
love the alpaca walking through the midst of the dance party!!
I LOVE PINK 💗
Te amo...!
There's no genre/style she can't adapt to
Strong 70s disco vibe
Toujours aussi belle et talentueuse <3
Love it🥳🥳🥳💃💃💃
What a fun song, it put a smile on my face.
MOMMY IS BACK 🎂✨🇧🇷
My idol ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Dancing shoes are for the celebration of circumstances. A spiritual mindset is celebration of emotional growth.
I love it!
LOVE this woman. Confident. Beautiful. Fun. Inclusive. Talented. Happy. Joyful. Fabulous. And, oh yeah, a great dancer! XXXOOO
Goosebumps!
love pink but I will never understand how someone can be a climate activist and a capitalist pawn at the same time
P!nk is ❤️❤️❤️
If i could bid all my money on this song to be a close-future #1 i would
Love you!! Love this message!! I've been saying this all year and even bought myself roller skates
OMG, I'm so happy that you drop a new song. your song is good as always. <3 waiting for more work from you, my idol <3
Dancing in my kitchen at 6am!! I needed this... Thanks!!!!!!!!
2022 and still listening.
Simplesmente a melhor 😍 como eu amo essa mulher! Nunca decepciona ❤️💕
'P!nk attitude' should be a used and accepted as a psychological defining trait.

Never ever disappoints!. Another hit. 😊🥰
everybody let's dance 🌟
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!! you're the one of one.

Yes serve us more happiness and joy P!nk. Thank you so much 🎶🎶👏👏🤩💖
P!nk never fail to amaze me. Her music is always there to keep me away from the verge of mental collapse.
P!nk is the best female solo artist in my opinion. I love her since I was a teenager, and I'm 29 now, but my love for her personality and music hasn't changed at all. ❤ Thank you for always creating amazing songs which inspire us, give us strength or put a smile on our face, even on the hardest days! 💖
Mal gespannt für wen dieser Song gesungen ist
PERFECT!
Simply the best🤩🤩
This looked like so much fun.
You de best
Too bad she drank the Covid Kool aid 🤣 She used to be a rebel ...she sold her soul to the agenda
Dude,, that's the same comment 🤣
SHOES!!! in the second part ❤❤❤ anyone knows the brand & model?  EDIT: Ok i found them! Looks like NEW ROCK - ANKLE BOOT WHITE TOWER
Ela nunca perde a sua autenticidade. Eu amo demais essa mulher. Essa artista. ❤️
Shakira poniendo de moda los supermercados

WELCOME BACK QUEEN 🎉❤
Love it so much
That is the next number 1 hit
Great job on the video!
Einfach ein Meisterwerk! Musikalisch, technisch, optisch! Alles ist aufeinander abgestimmt! Pink wie man sie seit Jahrzehnten kennt und doch wieder neu, wie immer! Gesellschaftskritik nett und bunt verpackt und doch so berührend!  Ein wshnsinnslied und eins der besten Musikvideos die ich jemals gesehen habe, man möchte es gleich wieder neu starten!  Toll wie alle sich am Ende der Party anschließen, es ist so wichtig sich von belastenden Dingen zu lösen. Rauchen, Alkohol, Ess-Sucht usw. Am Ende liegt das wahre Glück in und selbst und besteht wie in diesem Fall einfach aus TANZEN! 🎉 Das werde ich jetzt tun und höre diesen Song daheimsitze REPEAT!  Ganz ganz großes Kino und jetzt schon ein zeitloser Klassiker! Möge es die Welt zu einem besseren Ort machen 🌍 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 PINK! Germany loves you 🇩🇪
Amazing as always. Found my new ringtone ❤️❤️❤️
Pink sempre diferenciada parabéns música de uma vibe muito boa
Can't wait for the summer festival show🙏🏼
Elle doit percer cette musique !!!! Bravo P!nk
WOW ! ONLY POSITIVE EMOTIONS ! CONGRATS FROM BAKU !
HOW GOOD IS THE VIDEO?! 😍
Eu amo a Pink, porque ela é uma das poucas que ainda faz pop de verdade
Hmmm I’ve been a fan since her debut but I haven’t been able to connect to her music since 2017. Not feeling this one either.
THE QUEEN IS BACK! 😍
A true Queen❤
I've been saying this so much lately. I'm neverrr gonna not dance again. Thanks P!nk for always having a song for every chapter of my life and recovery
Did anyone else notice the “Fear Street” reference? Or am I wrong? lol  Ps: I’m hooked already 😍
There is no one else that has been entertaining me since age 16 and now I'm 37. There's not a single song of hers that I don't love. Her music saved me. She released Beautiful Trauma right after my dad died and I wouldn't have made it through that time without her music 💖
Nice song
Never Gonna Not Dance Again Lyrics [Verse 1] If someone told me that the world would end tonight You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love  [Pre-Chorus] But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancin' shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry We've already wasted enough time  [Chorus] I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance  [Verse 2] I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance) I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun  [Pre-Chorus] 'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do Is throw away my dancing shoes and Oh, lord, don't try me, really, not tonight I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry Know that I'm starting a fight  [Chorus] I'm never gonna not dance again I'm never gonna not dance again Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records There go all of my clothes Never gonna not dance again (Oh) D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, bruh D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance D-d-d-dance I'm gonna dance, yeah, d-d-d-dance

Thank you P!NK for always inspiring me to never give up. I have almost 18 months of sobriety after a 30 yr battle with drugs and alcohol. We are the same age. I listened to your music the most to get me through some really hard shit sober.! Please keep making music. I love you so much, and someday I will be able to afford to see you in person!! Maybe next year if you come closer to Seattle,, WA,  Portland, OR or Spokane, WA. They say ask for your dreams and make them specific. #cuzican. Thanks for reading this!! Rock on!!
I will be listening to the song in my car for weeks . My friends and family will know this song by the end of the week bc it WILL be played on repeat lol
Te amo muito. 🫶🏻👑
this song is great 💃💃💃💃💃🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺

I’ve loved every page of your journey. The good, the hard lessons, THE LOVE! There aren’t many people I enjoy the way I enjoy you. You music helped me enjoy good times, supported me in bad times, and held my hand as I walked through fire. I’m pretty glad the powers that be put you on this earth! ❤❤❤❤
Oh girl I love it sooo much!
I always love the subliminal messages in Pinks videos 🖤
i love pink but this song is just for north american market
She looks fantastic !!! xxx
Love it! ❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you, Pink I needed to remember I'm never gonna stop dancing again. Rough patch over. I love you😇.

This song just screams positivity! Love it! 🤩🎊🎉🥰😘🥳🏳️‍🌈🌸💐
Pink I have been following your music forever! You never disappoint me ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Love it! ❤️
Old skul P!nk back with a vengeance complete with the sarcastic humor, outfits and attitude!
She is one of my favourite singers ever , never has she done a bad song and she's still slaying ❤️❤️
Beautiful song 🤩
OMG! So much fun and Dan, dance, dance again and again!! I will love sing and dance this song on conciert 🥰🥰👌😉😉✌✌🎉🎊💃💃💃💃💃💃 LOVe U Pink!
she pulled a justin timberlake song
Jak zawsze nie zawodzi Miłego dnia ❤️🇵🇱🙃
Pink esta re regia única como siempre re linda Perú 🇵🇪❤️❤️
Alecia always makes me feel good about myself, I feel that everything is going to be ok.  Thank you so much Alecia
I love you P!nk
😍💙
Pink come to Brazil ! We love u  queen! 💚💛💚💛💚💛
Que showwwwww🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 amei cada pedacinho
❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! Great song! Smile from the beginning till the end 😍
More proof that Alicia Moore is not just a celebrity. She is an Artist and damn well talented! Keep Rocking P!nk you Aries moon Goddess! 💞🌻🙏🏻
Once again a feel good song with a deep message - I love it. In my opinion P!nk is one of the greatest artists of our time, because after all these yrs in the business she still is true to herself. 💖
P!nk be making them anthems don't she!??? The song and video makes me feel really good. Okay P, I see you!
Ok, how long of a comment do I want to say? Do it numerically... 1. She can do no wrong, obviously 2. I have what I call covid hair which is just not cutting it since covid popped up. Debating if I should go back to her haircut again. So tempting. 3. This makes me want to break out my roller skates. 4. Although she looks fantastic in them, as she does in everything, please don't tell me that style of jeans is coming back! 4. I just want to go to one of her shows because I LOVE HER!!! Pretty trivial but that's about all I want to say currently. Wouldn't it be mind blowing if she gave tickets to all of us that left positive comments? 🤞🏻LOL! Oh yeah.... Did I mention that I LOVE HER? 🤗💚
진짜 제발 한번만 한국와주면 안될까 언니
Amoooo, COME TO ARGENTINA PLEASE!!!
❤

Hated it! JOKING! PINK can do no wrong...and if she did, she'd do it right!
Rewelacyjna piosenka 🎶⭐️💥🤩, mocno wpada w ucho. Ta piosenka to jest świetny hit 🔥💪👍, uwielbiam tą piosenkę. ❤️🧡😍🥰. Pozdro z Polski 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱
Yo the pineapples lmao
Pink is everything.
Cool song 🎶⭐️💥🤩. Great P!NK 🔥💪👍. I love it ❤️🧡😍🥰. 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱
At this point P!nk is a legend in pop music period. 20 + years of good music, great tours and iconic music videos (aswell as hair styles) and she’s still going strong 💪🏾😍😁
Never disappoints! ❤
#950 It's simple Pink... I'll always love you 😍  I'll always be dancing,  even when I can't no more ♥️🧞‍♀️
She'll still be dropping  hits in 30 yrs time! And I'll still rocking out to them at 80 WITH my walking frame 😁🥰
Carpe diem, for the status quo rely on the popo, amirite?
Creatures, no human beings
Thank you Pink! At this time of my life this song is really important for me and my mum. She is a dance teacher and 2 months ago we moved to another city so she must start everything again and it's not that easy. Sometimes she thinks she'll never have dance school or dance again but now after this song she'll dance forever. Thank You)))
soooooo good
I LOVEEEEE ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Not only does this track feel nostalgic, but the throw back to the 888 number to promo the song is such an Ode! Only P!nk!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This new era will be amazing 😊🌟
I love this song <3
Bravo 👏 👏 👏 10
i hope mama will release an r&b/hip hop album just like her debut album.

MEXICO IS HERE 🇲🇽
Awesomeness  👌
Harley Quinn vibes when she appears with the trolley haha
Can't find Warcraft monthly subscription cards/packages in your local shop or it only has parts for bicycles from an end of an era - you are in the right place. There is a marketing strategy to put merchandise into shop shelf so the buyer is more likely to buy them or wonder where they are.
Wonder if my local Aldi does this...
*uhm no this aint it.. cheesy as fuck*
BRUTAL!!!!!!!!!
P!nk never disappoints! Instant classic ❤️
P!nk needs to collaborate with bts lol
Damn what a masterpiece is this 😍 love the dance moves she got 💕 love the song already

P!NK will always be amazing
Phenomenal!!!

Finally, there's something old but new in this pop song, at least. I find it different from many new songs from young "artists"
The timing of this video could not have been better. Needed this. 💜

I love this! It's such a bop. Super catchy, and has a summery feel.

Is it weird that this all makes perfect sense to me?! 😊❤ This woman is incredible
Welcome, DIsco Pink!
Amazing
❤️❤️❤️
P!nk chiquita hermosa, welcome back!!! 🥰
So I started watching the video feeling like it's a beautiful dance-y track but at the end it left me crying, i don't how P!nk does that - always bringing out the feelings! Dear P!nk I follow you since 2007 and I'm never gonna stop ❤
P!NK,   YOU'RE FREAKIN'  AMAZEBALLS!!...         🤹‍♀️🤹‍♀️🤹‍♀️ ..ON THE CONSTANT..    ✌🏽💖🤗💯❗    PEACE,LOVE  AND HAPPINESS        ALWAYS!   ~VARONICA~

Pink never misses
Look I love pink... HOWEVER! this seems like a blatant rip off of style of a artist whom I also love who's name is BETTY WHO! pink come on now I thought better of you how could you do that to another artist like that? The song is great but the video is a clear rip off...  so ashamed 😞
Yes!!!!!❤❤❤❤

I didn't expect this type of song! Still, very happy song-its what we all need, happy notes!
This is pure Gold, Silver, Rose Gold, Platinum, White Gold! I love this video because it shows the fun people use to have before we all became serious and I love love her first outfit and how she is buying frozen pizza and cake! Her body is fit too!
One thing about P!NK.. she gonna give you a bop. The hook is addicting!
This is giving me Don’t stop the feeling vibes but EVEN BETTER! P!nk doesn’t know how to make a bad song, gotta have this on repeat! LOVE IT! 🔥🔥🔥

Yıllar geçse de Pink sesi daha da gür ve güzel sen başkasın ilk aşkım.

Wow this woman can do no wrong when it comes to writing a classic tune! I really hope this gets to no1 and to all the dancers out there (good or bad) we are not stopping ❤️🔥

LEGEND & UNPROBLEMATIC ICON 💗
I thought it was "Never Gonna Nut"
LOVE P!NK!!! Another great hit with so much color!!
Weeeeee!!Nice!!!😘😘😘
I'm sorry why did I find out she was dropping this AFTER it was released. Thank goodness I found it 😍
She's always had a unique sound
You are always there P!nk. Thank you 🙏🏼
Queen!💞💞✨
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷 for a proper tour!!!
awesome
🙏YOU know how to surprise!! Thank you for that!! Adore!! I get a lot of beautiful emotions!! Thank you!! 🙌
Admittedly, I was a little surprised by this 1st single, NGNDA. It is different in comparison to her previous music, at least to my ear…definitely much more pop but her vocals provide some grit & depth, which gives it a great balance…I am really enjoying it.   Looking forward the release of this project.
IT'S A PLEASURE EVERYTIME PINK BRINGS OUT A NEW TUNE I LOVE THE LYRICS ❤️ LOVE THE WAY SHE LOOKS AT DAUGHTER WILLOW SAGE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN ADMIRE HER SO MUCH THANKS PINK FOR YOUR AMAZING SONGS AND NEVER DISAPOINT TAKE CARE ❤️🦋🌈
What’s stopping us from doing this at a Trader Joe’s? The queen has served again🎉🎉🎉love this so much

Another GREAT song by Queen P!nk that brings true JOY & LIGHT into my heart💚
Man I've been hearing a ton of Pinks songs in my little Midwest city. Guess she's getting more popular
The last part remind me like a prayer 1990 version  omg 😱
This is such a banger .... omg. Cmon pink 💗
I Love you ♥️ from México 🙏
absolutely love it 💝
From   ARGENTINA❤❤❤❤❤❤
Another great song from P!nk! This hits home for me. After having COVID twice, I've always felt so fatigued and I haven't danced as much as I used to. I've gained a lot of weight and have felt so weak. This song reminded me to keep on dancing.
like for the nicest and colorfull person in the word P!nk Thanks for remember us than growing up is not meaning to left be a kid and fun Hi from Mexico
0:45 every parents should do that when their kids are in temper
YES i needed this and whats best, its not another ''made for the summer'' song. NOOOO baby its November and winter is coming babyyyy! <3

I love it,so hot🔥🔥 thank you my Pink,🥰
My favourite singer ❤ I wish one day i will make it to attend her concert.
Yay 🎉🎉 Love me some P!NK 💖
Thank you for this energetic, lively and vibrant electroshock; exactly what the torpor and ambient gloom need  and what I needed ❤❤❤
Wow, it's like listening and watching her before 20 years ! Nothing has changed her really, she's awesome !
This song reminds me of my childhood, sitting on chairs at birthday parties wishing I could have fun and dance instead, fucking scared of being judged by the assholes around though. Years later, when I finally realized I had already wasted enough time, I told myself I would never not dance again... best thing I've ever done! TY, P!nk, for making me dance my own breakthrough ❤️🇧🇷
Im fan of Shakira but i love Pink Return :D
We were ALL in need of more P!nk music!! Yayyy+
Eyyyy! What a blesssing of a song! Keep creating
Guilty feet have lots of rhythm
When P!nk releases a new song I never get disappointed, how can this be? I love all the songs, all the videos. What a woman for god’s sake!
Pink! Never disappoints love your music such an awesome artist
hi<3
CAN'T STOP THE FEELING 2.0
wowwww the lyrics are great... beautiful inspiring song again.... looking forward to the concert. Let’s dance whoop whoop 💃🇦🇩
P!NK songs feels like a throwback songs.
Thank You P!nk you're the best!
Eu amo que ela nunca promete nada e sempre entrega tudo ❤
She is so iconic 🎉
You go girl
YEAHH PINK I LOVE SOO MUCH IM PERU
Hi P!NK, That grocery store looks familiar. I think, I've been there. I miss Queensland outback.
If you all say you P!no fans...you're not a bigger fan than myself... Welldone Alecia....this is beautiful... I'm in South Africa...when are you touring here...your fanbase is massive here....I've never been to you concert and I really need to experience it before I die...
Wait. I love this song!!
💜🛼🎶💜🛼🎶💜🛼🎶💜 #pink #dance #BESTEVER  #ourqueen 🙌👊👋🇦🇨🐨
Thank you as always!! My favorite artists for years and years and here’s why. Fierce and a fighter but not leaving behind joy and love❤
Loves from Türkiye.❤🥳🧡🥳💛🥳💚🥳💙🥳💜🥳❤🥳
This was everything I needed right now. I was just crying over how hard life feels right now and this out a massive smile on my face. P!nk you are my idol. Thanks for reminding me to pick up and keep dancing. 💗💗💗
I love P!nk, but I HATE this. I used to love how edgy and different she was and now she's doing bubblegum pop that sounds like it came directly off of Lizzo's album. She's so much better when she's her unique self... This is way too unoriginal.
Rock on Pink! ❤️
Absolutely freaking brilliant. Just what I needed. Thank you thank you thank you
Love
PINK you're super same to ever
Welcome back versatile queen 👑. She is trying to wake our inner self to be happy 😊
CANT BELIEVE IM SO EARLY
Team Pink... Love your songs... From Mexico
The queen is back ❤
I've been growing up with your music close to my heart. I think I can say decades now. From angry teenager to still-angry-but-willing-to-fight woman, I'm glad that many things change, but I can still use your music as the soundtrack of my life.
Thank U... Alicia ... U Will rise #1
What a voice!! 💜
The best Queen
R.I.P. in peace Pink 🙏 You'll always be in our hearts
Okay that was just too much fucking fun for its own good lmfao.  Another P!nk banger y'all!
Love P!Nk.
I fucking love this women... saved my life more times than she will ever know ❤️❤️
This is very millennial music
I love this woman! Such a wonderful person! ❤❤❤
Please have concert in Asia and Oceania soon ❤
Cuando I don't wanna dance again ella viene y me levanta, Te amo!!!!! ❤️😍💥🥇
We love you P!NK, thank you for making great music.
T E A M O O O O O O ! ! !
I am not a pop music lover at ALL but this woman could sing the phone book and I'm gonna listen! LOVELOVELOVE P!nk!
Surprise it doesn't say trending yet
Glory for Ukraine 💛💙
Ths is the first time in years I have liked Pink again I was getting sick to death of that soft pop rock sound.
Hello from Kiev, Ukraine 💛💙
Oh god i just love her ❤
🙏 To the person reading this, even though I don't know you. I wish you the best of what life has to offer. 🙏 🤗❤️
I love this!  I’m so so glad to see P!nk back in action!  I can’t wait to see her in concert!   ❤❤❤

Awesome song and video. 😃💖💗💖

🛼🛼
Soooo 2010’s bop!
This is why pink is number one of my favourite singers for as long as I can remember I’ve lost out on the long years and she never fells in getting a lot or a little message in threw her artistic way I really loved the animal I. Forgot what they are called it’s right at the back of my tongue but loved it she always keeps giving and never drops the ball I would definitely love to see her doing a Christmas song maybe a mixture of a carol or a hymn beefed up with her own parts of words added too it if anyone can do any style or meaningful insight then pink definitely can love and hugs 🤗 or even team up with pentonix. 💯💖🙏🦋🦋🦋🦋💖💖💖🎸💕💕💕
Queen is queening it again as always 👑
I LOVE YOU ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️💯🤟⛪️👰‍♀
Dang 2022 seems to be the year of all these iconic artists coming back after hiatus or leveling up in their music careers. I'm here for it.

Our Queen Rockstar is dancing with her best choreography💖 damn, she's perfectly multi-talented
I love alternative rock and metal and although it's such a different genre I've always loved Pink's music because she is so proudly unashamed of who she is and there's nothing more rockstar than that.
Glad to hear her again ❤️ pink is one of the few who's always bring the party and can make you cry with her melodies.
I clicked liked before starting the video.. :s
Singers from00s are the best
A fucking bop, obvi. SLAY QUEEN!

テンションあがるうううう！！！！
I love you pink 😍 I can't even tell you how this song relates to my soul right now. I retired from dancing last year and I've been struggling with not being able to do ballet anymore. I can still dance 😉 but it's sad to let go of years working on something. So... Once again lady your new music speaks to my soul. I love that your back to our old style with the baggy jeans 😂 I'm laughing at what is coming back and these kids take on it... Got to say... Way better than ours 😂 I'm so glad your in this world. You have been jamming with me across several types of rooms since highschool lady. I'm 38. I'll be your fan till I die. I love your music ..I love you as a dancer . You push the limits and I'm fascinated by your work on stage. I also lost my daughter last year and I live vicariously through you and yours 😂 seriously your my mom goal 😆 not even kidding. I want to dance with my baby one day to. If i get a chance.. I'm sending you a video 😂 just give me a few years.. I'm not giving up just yet 😉 😂 thanks for being authentic always. 🙏❤️🕯️
Perfeita né mores

The chorus lacks that catchy feel good kind of singalong for a dance song but still a decent fun song though

Why I almost hear Jessie J?😊 anyhow P!NK is incredibly amazing.
After listening to this seven times on repeat, I can confidently say, I LOVE IT!!! But I honestly can't think of a Pink song I haven't enjoyed.... Also no one does a live show/tour like Pink, she is quite literally, THE BEST!
A veces me dan ganas de ser un buen tipo, enderezar mi vida, casarme con ella y formar una familia. ♥ P!nksita bebé quiero salir en uno de tus videos, dame un beso y me lo tatuaré. 🥰
You are so beautiful!!!!! I love this!!!!!

Yesss, Queen is back🥳💃🕺
I’ve never known a love and passion and can empathize as much with another person (fucking rockstar!) quite like I have when I discovered Alicia Moore when I was younger. Her existence is a whole a$$ mf vibe!!! I love you beyond the moon and stars in the galaxy P!NK!!!
Your music is always amazing... My wife has been a super fan of yours since you started your career. She gets all the kids stuck on your songs and a lot of your songs helped her through childhood trauma and a toxic marriage 💚🖤. Thank you for being you and caring about everyone 💚🖤
This song is very impacting, that my Girl I love you P from then to now
YES!!!!!!!! NEVER EVER EVER EVER GONNA NOT DANCE AGAIN!!!!
Incredible video.  One of many blockbusters. Thank you P!nk.
La mejor artista del mundo 🌎   I lov u Alecia ♥️♥️♥️

I'm never gonna not listen to P!NK
💖
Los latinos presente en la casa
P!nk
For me, this is the year of P!nk! Her music helped during the toughest times last year. So my 4 yr old and I followed her to BottleRock and Ohana Fest this year, our summer covered in sunshine
Woah Girrrllll look at that body! You aged backwards! You look AMAZING!! Love the song. It’s a dancing song (no pun intended). AND, one more thing you can do>>> roller skate so smoothly. My butt would be on the ground. The fan list of “What is there that PINK CAN’T DO” is still empty!!!!  I swear there is nothing you can’t do. Talented, Creative, cooks, crochets, sings, entertains, dances, geez, the list doesn’t end. You are living  in such a great Chapter in your life.  You emit such happiness and joy. Love seeing and hearing it. Keep going Pink! You bring so much joy to people.
Finally, you’re back! I just wanna say that I’m such a huge fan of yours. I grew listening to your songs. You are always phenomenal and wonderful. Please continue making music. Thank you!❤❤❤
Love it!! Gonna be in my head all night💃
💃🏼💫💃🏼💫💃🏼💫😍
Great song and fantastic video, you look so beautiful🌟 I love it❤️
🤘🏽 #P!NK for President!    Can’t wait to see her on tour in Seattle again. I hope to meet her before I die. P!nk, you have helped me cope with a lot of pain in my life. I watched your “All I Know So Far” documentary today and I cried at work. I relate so much. #biggestfan #bucketlist
I saw a pair of roller skates on Urban Outfitters, but wondered if I should buy them or actually be careful with my money and not spend so frivolously.  Then this video came out.  They're coming in 8 days.
👌🏼🎶simplemente Magnífica! Pink I love ..🤘🏻😎🤩🥰
Caray! Me gusta el ritmo de esta canción 🎵🎶🎼 😍 P💗!💗N💗K💗 Mi cantante Pop favorita 👌💯💯💯💯

"Never Gonna Not Dance Again" is so uplifting! P!NK INSPIRES transformation with this track! I'm still dancing in my galley kitchen!

Tell her to make me a song. Hii P!nk 😊
This song will be played at parties, birthdays, masses, baptisms, weddings, divorces, graduations, funerals, Walmart, Target, at the North Pole, Atlantis, Wakanda and the apocalypse.  Love you Alecia.
Love it.!!!!!
I adore this woman!!!!
Holy wow. Pink is my favorite in the world and the best performer that has ever walked these 20 years or more.  Love everything about her style and energy... Hoping one day to actually see her live.  Somebody tell her to come to Texas!!!  PLEASE

I'm a P!nk super massive fan. Been on a P!nk binge all day today just cause the release of this song. I wish it went viral and number 1 on billboard.
Alguém do Brasil que ama a Pink ❤
Forever and always will P!nk have my heart 💜
Exactly what we needed 🔥🔥🔥 can’t wait for summer carnival, I missed out on your funhouse tour and was heartbroken. I never ended up going to your shows since missing out on an opportunity (my mum got tickets and went with her friend instead of me😢). But as soon as I saw you promoting the summer carnival I knew it was going to be another once in a life time show and was determined not to miss out again so I bought tickets for me and my two best friends. I honestly cannot wait. Great song I’ll be putting on my dancing shoes ready for your show in June! Sending love from London🤍
😍❤️🇦🇷
Best show / concerts EVER!!!   Don’t miss one!   Thank you for all the music I’ve used for the soundtrack of my life!!
💖I LOVE YOU!💖 💖I HEAR YOUR MESSAGES💖 💖FEEL THE SAME WAY!💖
I love it when artists get crowds involved..👍
Did anyone just freestyle in their kitchen to this? 🤣🤘🏻🔥🎶🥰💃🕺
TE AMO PINK !!!!!  y AMO TU MUSICA!!!🔥🔥🔥❤️👏🏻
💃❤️🙌💐💃
Pink is whatever she wants to be and that's powerful 😍 I love her since I was a girl and still loving her in my 30's. All of her songs are truly an inspiration.
Me quedo como anillo al dedo! Queen P!nk!!

P!nk doesn't get the recognition that she deserves for her music or for her performances at award shows.
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I'm so excited!!! I hope this means a new album is on it's way. <3
#Pink ❤️🇧🇷

So exciting!! Hello to Willow and Jameson! Hey Carey! Pink/Alicia  you are such an inspiration to so many.  Especially to me,  you are true to you and that shows us women be true to yourself,  never settle and let other's try to control what you do!! ❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈🎶🎵

The song is already out in the U.K. if anyone wants to know as it's gone past midnight! Just listened to it on Apple Music. Can't wait to see this music video to really bring it to life! 🙌🏼🪩🛼🎊 #NGNDA
My wife is a massive fan, but she can’t see you in concert because she has epilepsy and strobe lights could cause her to have seizures. If you ever consider a strobe-free and laser-free concert, we will do our best to be there, wherever you are. Keep being awesome. 🇺🇸
💖🛼💖

She's about to go off in this music video!
I agree! This is her "get the party started" but better! The  clips I hear make me want MORE (also an amazing song by her lol) but I cannot wait to blare this and sing it at the top Of my lungs! It's a chart topper  💯% She just keeps getting better! I define my life in p!nk albums and it sounds like some good times ahead!  (Luckily at a time when I need them the most!)
I can’t wait, this is going to be blasting on my speakers at work tommorow
Another masterpiece ❤️ I can’t wait 😍
Well, that's a BUMMER of note ... LOVE ALECIA. But, I get you, hun, and WHY ... Regardless, you will still forever be known as "The Most Electrifying Performer of All Time" ... which few can question. YOU GO, GIRL ~ WHETHER YOU DANCE OR NOT ~ You'll always be beautiful ... On the inside and out 💕💕💕
So excited for this!!
I’ve been in love with this woman for the past 22yrs! She’s amazing, I would love to hear her back into RNB again!
Can’t wait can’t wait
P!nk is about to give us the end of 2022 hit we all need!
Me encantaaaa❤
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Omg...love the 70's disco roller skating vibes!! Can't wait til Friday 11/4 to see and hear this new song from Pink!  🛼
Calling all the P!nk stans, help us so that in the next tour P!nk adds dates in many Latin American countries. Please, we love her.
she makes a hit again!!!!! Always love you by my ♥
Can't wait!!! You never disappoint us!! Saw you 3 times in Toronto and I really hope you come back so I can make it 4 or 5 or 6!! You saw my sign I made with lights on it the first night about me taking my mom because we were celebrating her beating breast cancer and you read it and blew us a kiss! We were right at the end of the stage just off to your left. I doubt you'd remember that, but I'll never forget it! Thank you for always being yourself and being a voice for so many who won't be heard in too many ways. Keep on being you're amazing, rad,.absolutely wonderful self!!! 🤟
Can't wait!!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAA TE AMO
❣️❣️❣️
Another hit, no doubt.
Really excited as she always comes out with amazing tracks and her vocals are truly the best xxx  welcome back cant-wait
So excited 😊
Mega ansiosa pela volta da queen p!nk 🤩
Best singer of our generation. So underrated. Also, a part of the chorus sounds like "Can't Stop The Feeling" by Justin Timberlake. Also, the same producers. I LOVE IT!!! It's such a good feeling song. This has to chart! ❤😍
Wish they would've let you film in the other store ! ! !  I can't wait for this video (and song) !
Already my #1!!! 😏🙃🔥
❤❤❤❤
This reminds me of the social shutdowns of 2020. Those were particularly hard because my mom was murdered shortly before, and it was very hard for me to mourn her in isolation, with no access to other people, parks, etc. NEVER AGAIN
P!nk lost her irreverence ☹️ I miss she bringing us songs like U+Ur hand, don't let me get me, stupid girls, bad influence, etc
🤸🏼‍♀️🤍🤍🤍🤍
So excited this is definitely about to be on replay💞
I can’t wait!!!!!!! When is the album coming out please? ❤🔥
Please bring your 2023 tour back to Boston!!!
yes yes yes!! can't wait!!! she's back and bringing the party with her 👏💗🌟🎉🥳🛼💞♥💙💜🧡💛💚
Never Gonna Not Love this bop, or anything at all you put into the world. You’re always 🔥 Can’t wait…LET’s GO! 🫶💓🛼
It's gonna be a club smash
It's already my favorite new song and all I've heard so far is the chorus!!!  I can't wait!!!
So f***ing EXCITED!!! 🎉🎉😊
Can't wait, last concert I attend with my sis.💔 So many great memories Pink brings out😍🫶
