the real
The only reason the blazers Loss is because Damian Lillard did not play
Just look at them!! They even know they're living out an unlaughable joke  called covid professional protesters  .I MEAN SPORTS  WHATEVER THAT MEANS 🤯🐵
REALLY BASKETBALL IS PATHETICALLY AN INSULT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE OF THE WORLD!!! FUCK BASKETBALL! ITS RIGHT THERE WITH GOLF AND CROQUET!! HOCKEY AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS ACTUALLY EARN THEIR MILLIONS!!!
Lakers are so good
Can someone tell me where was Lillard at I haven’t kept up !
Can we all start to refer to Caruso as Friar Tuck, this man is a god among man!
6:17 got me dead
it’s just so easy for LeBron
The last 5 minutes really showed AD and LeBron want it BAD
lakers winning champion
Yeah Let’s Go Lakers That’s  What You Get When Miss Up With Kobe’s Tribute Last February. Especially U Damian Lizzard

Let’s be honest the blazers weren’t gonna fucking win
At 6.14 did y'all here him say get that shit outta here Nigga
I can't be the only one watching these games man. CJ and Trent literally cost them the game with their selfish plays, trying to elevate their ego in a time of team basketball. They spent more time and energy freezing Melo out in the 3rd than actually trying to beat the Lakers. Chucking up shots contested by dudes twice their size.
lol people saying lakers would lose in game 7.
This is the playoffs? somethings off....
muffin time
The suns deserved the 8th seed more than dame choking time!
Hope lakers win 4 Kobe 👏💛💜
2:17 Howard looking like a point guard.
Djmeech called it "Lakers in 5 I'm LeBron James"
Nurkic is still afraid of bron i think he still remember when bron posterize him in 2018
go lakers
Boiiiii That CrossOver Thoo ! CJ Give KCP His Ankles Back😂😂
Lakers will win this season  i am sure.
Deontray Trayvon Bennett is a bitch. Put that on your jersey!
To NBA Executives: please tell the camera crews in the games to stop cutting away when players attempt shots after the whistle. I watch in hope it goes in but then the camera crew switches view right before the ball drops
Lakers will be LUCKY if they win the next round 4-3...
6:18 😂😂😂

Lakers Team Highlighst https://youtu.be/snmfmRp7kgg
Lakers definitely gonna win the rockets in 6
this season was a tough lesson for ja morant and grizzlies he put 37 points against blazers and still lost playoff determination game by 4. grizzlies are amazing
Blazerz didn’t lose because of not having dame but not having Dane was a factor
"Get that shit outta here": @6:14
Carmelo is a shooter a college level player.  If played all around basketball they would have had a chance.
without damian of course lakers Win haha!
Melo was saucing them boys
Props for the blazers for having an incredible bubble performance
6:17 “ get that shit outta here Nigga “

Black lives can’t matter until Chinese shoe maker lives matter
How quick we forget how he used to get calls made when they barely looked at him wrong they would be fouled that's call being baby sitted by Moron  commissioner silver  He can say he was lucky he had a baby sitter watching his back
Lebron James was baby through all of his career by silver when people used to look at him wrong they where foul
Looks like Cj traveled at :42

AD has carried the team this series in terms of scoring... MAJORLY
unheard truth about floyd- he is a ped user he used saline injection and vitamins 39 days before his fight against berto and pacman, he paid usada so he can used ped , floyd should be ban from boxing ang forfeit all his belt hes a fake hall of famer, he was also beaten 5 times such as castillo beats him also maidana, dela hoya, pacquiao and mosley beats him so it is 50-5 record.even pacquiao have shoulder injury during first fight against mayweather pacquiao clearly wins in that fight pacquiao was robbed, how much more if pacquaio is healthy and not injured surely maywearther will get knocked out by pacquiao, floyd was really very luck pacmam get injured
I heard at least FIVE "and ones" from the Blazers, all were NO CALLS. fuck this shit.

WAKE UP! The Tribulations are coming very soon! Jesus will be returning near the end of the tribulations! Repent now! Turn away from your sins and follow Jesus Christ who died for your sins! All the world events have been prophesied, they have been predicted in the Bible and are happening right now! Storms, earthquakes, flooding, fires, locusts, asteroids, and rioting (lawlessness/sin). Many nations are going to form an alliance and attack Israel. There are going to be famines and tons of extreme destructive weather and sickness. The world is going to follow the New World Order in which everyone is united under one government and it will be an evil one. They will pretend to be peaceful and loving, but when the time comes they will tear the world apart and start killing everyone. "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. (Matthew 24:7 King James Version)" "And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. (Luke 21:11 King James Version)" "And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke (Joel 2:30 King James Version)" . You are all sinners, just like me! You are wicked and live in lies! Repent now or you will be thrown into the pit of fire! The wages of sin are death! "23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23 King James Version) Here is the good news! You can be saved, and taken out of the world before this time comes and be with Jesus Christ! "16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 King James Version)" "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version)" . ABC's of Salvation (How to be Saved): "9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:9-10 King James Version)" Admit you're a sinner and that you need to be saved and forgiven, and that you can't enter into Heaven by your own works but by Jesus Christ. Believe in Jesus Christ truly with all your heart and that He died on the cross for your sins, and rose on the third day. Commit/Call to God with all of your heart, and pray to God. Ask for forgiveness and to be given the gift of salvation and to be sealed by the Holy Spirit. REPENT! . Then continue to walk in His light, and hold His hand and let Him guide you through life and protect you. No one can take you out of His hand. "28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.  30 I and my Father are one. (John 10:28-30 King James Version)" . "40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. (John 6:40 KJV)" . Thanks be to God forever and ever! Glory be to God forever and ever! God bless you! God bless President Trump! Amen.

It's funny to see how much shit Lakers fans talk after their team just knocked off an 8th seed in the first round of the playoffs lmao.
#KillTheNBA
I would like to see Dame leave Portland so he could possibly win a championship. If he stays in Portland, they need to add a really good big man. He and McCollum are the only superstars.
I told you guys Melo was trash this proves it!
If LeBron can get past the western conference finals I think he got number 4
Them LA boys is ready, we ready for you'll.
Portland didn't have enough
6:18 shit out her N!gga

Not only the referees are on the Lakers side...even the commentators....🤮🤮🤮 Lebron's flop with Melo was so shameful it was hard to watch. And then the commentators::🤣🤣🤣 'Look at the grace and skills......" On what????? On a huge flop??????🤮🤮🤮🤮 The NBA is a fiasco.... Like the WWF in its worst days.

Hey did dorris fix. That mommiefied face?
Damian  lillard  needs to think about his future if this team be able to when a championship.Or he might need to text the market and put himself on a championship contender because he is getting older not younger. he should think about after he recovers.
NBA, please move to China.
That shit was rigged in u can tell damn
Not the same without the crowd, it's almost unwatchable for me. Tired of this Corona bs
The media and all these sports analysts were hyping up the blazers a lot more than the actual fans were. As a blazers fan of course I wanted the blazers to at least win a couple games, but we all knew there wasn’t gonna be an easy win and we definitely didn’t think we would sweep the lakers. Media was making it seem like LeBron and AD were just gonna roll over and let Portland win the series.
7:25 - Redemption for Kuzma after talking shit around the 6:17 mark just for the Blazers to the the putback bucket, cause that sequence was BEAUTIFULLY done. 👌🏾
ONLY RAPTORS can beat the Lakers...😂
Lebron is the best Basketball player of all time
Show this to the N.B.A. Players.  Tell them Grim would like for them to respond on this.                                               https://youtu.be/LhJJ8UjDKXk

Not a Blazer fan but this series just shows how much Lakers gonna struggle they could barley beat a team without 2 starters and half their bench out...what's gonna happen when they play a healthy team I can't see this team getting passed Clippers/Mavs hell even Rockets if they did somehow manage too Bucks would smack them up...that's what happens when you don't not have two players and the rest of ur team is average at best.
Kuz “get dat shit out here nigga”😂
Melo cookin em
I told yall, we would be fine💛💜🙏💪😎
Playoff Lebron activated 🤔??
His prime was in the heat and cavs he left his prime ever since he move to the lakers

Lmmfao
LeBron is allowed an extra step and three aggressive elbows into defenders every time he drives into the lane. Then he cries every single play he doesn't draw a foul. As a defender you might as well just drop shoulder into James, and elbow him in his face every play, since refs are going to call you on his contact anyway.
Where all the BLAZER hype BOIS go!?!? All we heard was lakers in trouble and the got SMASHED!
4:59 Melo: I got it f*k outta here... then gets it taken from danny LMAOOO
I gotta say, even without Dame, the Blazers put up much more of a fight in this game than I was expecting!
game 3 and 5 were super close until final quarter - portland couldve stolen those. Wish the blazers were healthy - put up hell of a fight. cant wait for the battle of LA

DWIGHT SUPERMAN HOWARD I SEE YOUUUUUU
Who here as a Grizzlies fan so happy to see Portland about to get a eliminated
Lebron is the best player in the league
CJ McCollum is amazing
Damn I thought it was dame time 🤣
We all know the league wants lakers to win a chip. They will get it. Stop watching ... they’re also using BLM so people can show no attention to the pizza gate and sex trafficking ring ran by the elites all around the world. sheep!
clippers will crush that LeBum team
carolling epizoite
Anthony still lazy on deffense
Damian Lillard injured and the Portland Trailblazers still scored 120 points,  and against this defense.  Imagine what the Houston Rockets can do to that Laker defense.
Portland need to put a squad around Dame, or eventually he gonna leave. When he got hurt you knew this was over
🖕🖕
Why cj break that man like that 0:40
Let's go that's what I am talking about and I can hear lebron already saying proud of the guys for closing out the series but still not satisfied
If you don't think Lebron is one of the best ever, then you weren't watching this game.
Lakers all the way... or whatever lol
Seems like passing the ball to Green for a three was not an option to the Lakers HAHAHA
Lebron and AD bringin them Shaq n Kobe chemistry back to LA...easy
Chris Webber will forever be a Laker Hater.... He still has nightmares playing for Sacramento & Big Shot Robert Horry hit that buzzer beater to send him home.
6:16 "get dat shit outta here nigga" 🤣😂
Lmfao @ 5:00
Everytime LeBron says "aye" when he's driving in the paint the refs blow a whistle. Hmmmm.
It seems to me that each time The Lakers have a big lead The Blazers would come right back I’m glad The Lakers got the win but when they play their next opponent they really need to work on defense and continue attack the basket
🤔🤔🤔 no dame y tf is this game so close
Let’s go Lakers
Give the Blazers all respect. You lose alot of key players from the start then you lose your best player. Mad respects to the Blazers and RIP to Cliff Robinson. Future Hall of Famer
6:16 your welcome
Lebron James And Anthony Davis Activates PED Mode  Meant Play Off Mode !

The Lakers will grind their way to another Championship.
Next?
Very sloppy game
Lebron wouldn’t go to the hole like that back in the day, these guys just move out the way.
6:16 get that shit outta her n*gga
Why TF was Gary Trent guarding LeBron the whole series? Dumb asf

WAY TO GO LAKERS
Fuck the NBA..losers
No dame? Hmm wonder why lakers won
I hate to see lakers win. Used to like lebron but man hard to like him now that he's trying to pretend like he knows about politics and other things that NOT basketball. Say in your lane. You losing fans
NBA ratings are shit
Whiteside plays like he don’t even wanna play lmao
If the blazers won they could’ve won the series cuz lillard would be back and better than ever nothing but respect to the blazers
Lakers v Boston Finals
Buenos días👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🏀😄
Lebron stick to basketball other topics are not for you
“Bron can’t shoot”🤦🏽‍♂️
Blazers and Magic: We won the first game, now we're gonna win the series!          Lebron and Giannis: Hold my beer...
Lol when they said Portland was gonna sweep the lakers
An unbelievable amount of open 3. Pointers in the corner for the Lakers. No excuse for it. Blazers ain't goin anywhere until their defense improves.
Enjoy it now cuz NBA is almost dead.  R.I.P.
I thought thought these losers were on strike.
Kuzma @ 6:17 Get ur shit out here nigga LMFAO
melo really showed out this series
6:17 “get outta here nigga”
Carmelo keeps rocking that number 0 like that’s the amount of rings he wants in his career smh lol

I am so proud of the L.A Lakers winning the game against the Portland Trail blazers!!! The L.A Lakers are moving on in the second round!!! I'm so happy that the Lakers won the game!!! LeBron James and Anthony Davis had a good day against the Portland Trail blazers!!! All the L.A Lakers need now is a NBA finals championship!!! I'm so freaking happy that the L.A Lakers won a NBA finals championship!!! All the L.A Lakers do is win!!! I'm so happy that we won the game, if we keep playing like this we're going to have a NBA finals championship. I am so, proud of our team. I know that we're going to win a NBA finals championship, if we keep playing like this. Way to go for LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the L.A Lakers!!! Let's go Lakers!!! I love the L.A Lakers!!! How bout them Los Angeles Lakers!!! I 🖤 L.A!!! Let's go Lakers!!! I love LeBron James!!! Let's go Lakers!!! The L.A Lakers are moving on to the second round!!! Hooray for the L.A Lakers!!!

I’m just mad how Carmelo didn’t had enough highlights if they would of let them do his thing they would of had another game but the lakers won let’s t
Good game wit no Lillard ya the Lakers got some things to work on for the next round
Rockets Gone Give The Lakers Some Problems Especially If Everyone Stays Healthy
Let's just take a moment to GIVE IT UP FOR MELO!!! Hes gotten the most disrespect on the team. To make it back his 1st year and help elevate this Blazers team to the 8th seed is amazing and impressive. I thought for sure it might be a game 6 at the middle of 4th quarter
Lakers will sweep The Rockets
Remember they won game 1 and ppl thought the blazers could win it all hahaha
All I can is gg I have so much respect for blazers
I love lbj d king

6:18 “ get outta here ni**a”
6:16 "get out of hear nigga" 😂
4:58 Carmelo- I got it I GOT IT I GOT IT. * proceeds to get strip and lay on the floor  lmfaoo
First time watching a game with headphones on and all I hear is lebron yelling “eeeyyyy” every drive he makes 😂 and a lot of N-word coming from players well except the white folks...  great job Lakers on to the next
Can anyone name a player who pulls up faster than Melo?
Can we continue this 🐐 talk now Paul Pierce?
LeBron james, AD had a legendary series both played at a legendary level. The Lakers are ready to win a championship this year and the Lakers look like a championship basketball team.
LeBron looks like he could still play another 4 years.  If he does that, then he will pass Kareem as the all time leading scorer in NBA history, provided that he does not have any major injuries over that period. http://www.espn.com/nba/history/leaders

Kuzma be fucking up
Virtuoso😂😂
Shouts to Melo, and salute to Portland!
That shit wack asf it was supposed to go 7 games 🤷🏽‍♂️
6:17 That's what I thought I heard from Kuzma 😅😂😭
NBA should automaticly give a technical fault and a fine everytime a player scream : " And 1 !".
Watch the 3 to 4 possessions. Smh Melo played NO DEFENSE Lmao.
Hahahaha it’s not like Portland needed a pick me up considering their city is on fire or anything. Poor socialists can’t catch a break 🤣
Theres alot of crow pie being served right now
They use magnets in the rims
6:15 "get out of here nxgga" 😂
So proud of Carmelo
DAME AND CJ NEED TO WORK ON THEIR DEFENSE THEY BOTH OFFENSIVE THREAT BUT THAT'S ALL ONE OF THEM NEED TO BE A GREAT PERIMETER DEFENDER.
😂 😂 wtf did Kuzma say when he blocked that shot? His momma gonna hear that
Where are all the people who were talking shit when the lakers lost that 1 game... where ya'll at ?
It's funny as f lebron looks for a foul every single time like they're gonna call 20 fouls a game just for him 😂
No one can defeat LA LAKERS💪
It was not a prophecy it is our reality
Where’s Bron’s dunk?
All the Nuggets fans lowkey rooting for Melo.
Good series... respect for the blazers. They battled to get there
Blazers had a great Game. But our Lakers team didn’t play great defense in this Game.  Anyway the win still feels awesome.🏀🏀
Melo was cooking. He got a habit of just standing in the corner waiting on the ball tho. He sets no screens or nothing. Smh he should have fought harder
iWant Dame With A Ring So Bad.
5:02 had me rollin 🤣  Melo tamlbout I got it I got it, lmao danny green finessed his old ass
Blazers need a bonafide shooting guard IMO
Any1 who says Blazers didn't deserve to be in playoffs (like Skip Bayless) is just wrong IMO. I thought LAL would blow them out, but Blazers fought thru.

Let's admit it. The Morris brother would be in jail if it wasn't for the NBA. Even while in the NBA they act like thugs and get into trouble with the law.

Fuck Lebron, Fuck the new NBA. Makes Sports about Sports again.
@6:17 You can hear Kuzma say “Get that shiiit outta here nigga”.... as he blocks the shot😂
why were the lakers not playing defense in the lane for the last 5 minutes?
What Happened Chuck 🤔😂🤣😂
I don't respect Lebron as a legend of basketball like Jordan or any other real legend that didn't have the luxury to pick who he wants on his team like a basketball game at the park. He has to have a loaded roster to play for any team he go to. Lakers  got players on the bench who were good starters on other teams
MEEEELOOO TOUGH
Melo should join lebron next season.. He looks so aged old like he don't care I feel bad for him great friend of the king
Nba
LeBron James is the KING!!!
Blazers held there own
Get outta here n**** 6:19 bruh
Much respect for Portland. Lost by 9 without Dame proves that they have heart. I may be a  Lakers fan but Portland has a lot of promise.✊
The Portland Trailblazers will be back next season. At least they've gotten to the first round. It could have been worse.
Semi finals: JAMES vs JAMES
6:16 get the shit outta here nikka had me dead
Blazers done and never going anywhere, Dame's time has passed for good. Gotta hope the Rockets can beat LA now.
Good luck beating Lebron James and The Lakers 4 times out of 7

Bro lakers defense is butt right now.
Boss Pashoutout kay Patricia Gaylle Mendoza.
I love how their careers are headed for being minimum wage paying jobs. They don’t realize yet that the political narrative being pushed comes from globalist Elite. The handlers that have almost the entire planet enslaved. Wakey, wakey ballers! Break away from that evil Democratic Party and think for yourselfs. Btw, ALL LIVES MATTER! PERIOD!! If you don’t believe that, YOU are the racist. There’s no room for that here. Trump 2Q2Q!!

Fuck LeBron's racist ass, he gets on interviews talking about racism but he said himself that he didn't like white people until he got into college. Boy if that wasthe other way around. But EQUALITY right?
Lakers vs Clippers WCF gonna be 🔥
I bleed purple and gold but props to Portland they had a helluva push to even get into the playoffs then put up a good fight against a superior team.
Congrats for the Lakers for making to the 2nd round and well respect for the Blazers for making it to the 8th seed
May i ask where is lillard
Dame deserve a ring beast mode
6:14 get that shit outta here
Danny green with the Zion steal 😂
Player Paycheck Matter...
Kuz at 618 told cj to get that outta here nigga
I still don't get why teams play out on Lebron. If he averages 45 plus a game and beats my teams in a series from 3 point land, so be it but I'm not letting him get that and everyone else involved by playing single coverage on him  to he can drive to the lane and kick or screen/roll. I guess people don't watch Popovich's tapes.
This is why I loved the Lakers all my 13 years of life even on there worst days I still rootin for them hope we win the finals cuz I'll be mad Dena mfka😂
The bubble suns would’ve swept the Lakers 🚫🧢

Blazers just need to be healthy in the offseason, keep Melo, and get better next year. They got something good going there
I’m a new fishing YouTuber also , if you can just stop by my channel & show any type of support on my first video liking / commenting / subscribing . That would mean ALOT ! God bless y’all and thanks to the ones that can help out !🎣
Melo is better than LeBron and AD combined.
Damian Lillard got hurt that's alright we'll be back next year Lakers I can't stand them 😭
Lakers getting back into their grove again! Let’s get the championship for Kobe!
Blazers was a below 500 8th that dont play defense. Lets not get too excited here smh lol
You know games over if cook and dudly are on the court.
Member the Blazers we're supposed to upset the Lakers ???? Lol
I knew Melo still had game. Man I wish the Lakes would've signed him. Lj..melo..ad..kcp & rr/ac!

Really hope the blazers bring back melo
am i the only one who heard "and 1 nigga" at 6:25 onwards 😂
Where DAME TIME? Bye Bye 👋✋👋
I knew the lakers will win this series.
Blazers just needed a Damian Lillard for victory
I wonder if front office will renew Carmello after seeing that turnover steal on 5:00 lolz

WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS THIS : WHY WILL PORTLAND WILL WANT TO PLAY THE LAKERS GAME AND NOT THEIR GAME ( THEY HAVE SO MANY SHARPSHOOTERS THAT'S THEIR GAME ) , AND THE SAME QUESTION GO FOR DALLAS .
They wanted to protest for BLM but out here saying the N word on national television SMH
bad body language for nurkic for the whole series
6:16 get outta here N 🤣🤣
8:03 "because they don't have ball handler ..."  They do have. Why they'd recruit Dion Waiters? For nothing? Settle for D.Green and KCP as shooters while having JR Smith?

Skip : on  Monday James miss 2 FT Shay : didn't do that skip 😄

Alright Now Root For The Clippers
“Fuck outta here nigga” “ AND ONE NIGGA” lmao yo how u get these uncensored games? Everytime i watch they bleep everything
6:18 kuzma says get that shit outta here nigga
Everyone saying they beat an 8th seed (no big deal) but there's more to that. Nurk is a big part of this team and he played less than 10 games during the season due to injury. He is also a big reason why they suddenly played well (in the bubble) to snatch the 8th seed from Memphis. To me they would be the 5th seed if Nurk was healthy during the season so the Lakers fought way better talent than a normal 8th seed. This is why Chuck and others were so high on the Blazers.
All of these positive comments. Put a smile lm my face
DIDNT A BUNCH OF DUMBASSES COMPLAIN ABOUT LEBRON JAMES PLAYING IN A WEAK EAST AND SAID HE WOULDNT LAST IN THE WEST.
4:58 nobody asked
@ Every salty blazer fan ever. I stood by my word that the Lakers would gentleman's sweep you guys after game 1 and guess what happened...
The heart of nurk, cj, melo was unleashed in this game but they were severely undermanned and came up short. Respect.
6:15 "Get that shit out of here ni66a" LOL!
Double standards man.. 6:15 and 6:28. Postponing and shit all a show
Feeling bad for Damian and the team. Injuries are really a pain in the ass. 😢
Goodluck hahahaha HOUSTON is coming 🤣😂
CJ bag so different, it’s amazing how smooth his game really is .
Damn cj played so good today the kinda shots he made and his moves were awsome ❤️❤️
when lakers lost game 1: yall where are those saying lakers will sweep blazers, blazer in 4, im seeing games an upset lakers gonna lose this  when lakers win series 4-1: props to the blazers effort, what an incredible performance, so much respect.. etc..  haters cant say right words right now!! idiot!
Melo whole comeback season was 🔥🔥and made the playoffs never doubted dude when shoot a Fade away I still Melo me a n****💯💪🏽
I would’ve rather watched Memphis vs Lakers.
I use to think i knew what the traveling rule was
2:40 i Don't know why it's funny, each one of the commentators farted😂
I TOLD YOU MAN, THIS SERIES END UP UNTIL GAME 5 ONLY, CONGRATS MY TEAM👍❤️👍
I feel bad for Carmelo.
They should start callig Ts for too many "and-1" screams
It’s McCollum scoring and having the ball bounce off his head after for me
I hope Dwight win this years ring the guy deserve it before he retire
lebron 27.4  points 10.2 rebounds 10. 2 assist avg in the playoffs so far...
“Don’t give easy buckets to the lakers” LeBron shoots over Nurkic.       Easy buckets 💪🏻
6:17 “Get outta here n*gga” 6:28 “And 1 n*gga!” 😂😂
6:17 lol
Respect for Portland fr. #lakeshow
“Blazers in 7”
We all understand, the two most HATED things in the NBA are:  The Lakers  & Lebron  *With the Clippers (minus Kawhi) fighting for the title lol  But even the peope that hate BOTH the Lakers and Bron KNOW that when AD and Bron are both attacking the rim, no team has a chance....   I been telling people when the playoffs start your going to see playoff Bron  30+ 10+ 10+ a night  AD is have 30+ 10+ 4+  The only thing that will keep teams in games when these 2 are locked in is if their teammates brick EVERYTHING for FOUR GAMES in a row...  Highly unlikely
Got some uncensored trash talk at 6:16 and at 6:28
Not really sure why people thought the BLaLers were gonna sweep the lakers but all the haters that said that hold this L
Cj my boy though..what a beast. LeBron, thats the LeBron I like to see
LeBron On a roll right Now. the beast has been awoken the league better watch out, my mans on a mission. Just wait until the lakers get they’re chemistry to a-1 they’ll be almost unstoppable.
I’m so proud our lakers have advanced to the second round!!Win lose or draw it’s just good for the nba to see such a historical franchise back in the race!Along with the Celtics on the East. #LAKERNATION
Hahaha where are all the people saying blazers advancing lmao casuals hahah
Where is Paul pierce?
6:17 😂😂
Why the dumbass lakerz sign Jared Dudley over melo ... smh
Who heard "Get out of here n*gga" at 6:16
LEZZGLAKERS!!🏆
One hundred percent respect Portland they played hard all the way till the end.
Everyone needs to process that the Lakers have the toughest path to a championship right now. First round against an on fire Blazers and Dame, second round will be the Rockets, conference finals will be the Clippers, then most likely the final boss of the Bucks in the Finals. IF they win, it’s the biggest win and hardest win in Laker history. Because they had to play top tier teams the whole way through during a pandemic in a bubble. Lebron knows this and is ready. This ring should count as 2....and will be replayed in highlights for decades to come as the weirdest end to a season. Lebron is all about Legacy and telling his story. With him and AD playing like this...I think they’re about to make history.
Ok I have a question how did McCollum walk away like nothing happened after the ball fell right on his head
NBA wackkk!!
LeBum is a cry baby. . . Flat out
Lebron & AD so dominant made it look ez tonight. Bring on the Rockets
6:17 LMFAOOOOO
Dem boys had heart shout out to Portland ❤️
portland always lose in semi finals yuck portland fan's now is crying
7:05 _"Did U see the no-look right there by Nurkic? That was nice!! 😀"_   Yeah, we've seen better.
6:18 “get dat Outta here nigga” 😂😂
What did he say at @6:14?
6:14 Kuzma says something when he block CJ
6:27 and one, nigga!
The biggest problem of Lakers is they don't have another facilitator when LeBron sits.
6:16  "When you Tired of your Neighbors leaving their Trash in your Yard"... Mutombo Finger!!! ☝🏿
Anybody wondering when Terry stotts is gonna get fired?? Or is it just me? 😂🤔
Bron doing this at 35 is insane.
that first play when mcgee gets stuffed. feelsbadman
"GET OUTTA HERE NIGGA!" 6:17
CJ balled! He went to the rack! Didn’t know he had that in em. I’m proud of Portland. They all played well. All they needed was Dame Dolla for that extra push at the end.
@ 6:16 turn volume up Lmaoo
3:31 I've never seen LeBron shoot that way :/
Dame time?
6:17 got me dead 😭
Shoutout to the blazers played their heart out even against so many obstacles Cj and Melo wet off wish we can see more Melo vs Lebron iconic duels or even them playing together
Skip be like lakers are terrible my clippers are going to whoop them the blazers with nobody’s kept the game close till the very end my clippers are playing a real basketball team with their choke star luka that is a terrible free throw shooter and a terrible three point shooter and just got lucky as my boyfriend would put it that was a bad shot damn flight is so inspirational
Team LA Lakers Idol LJames super stronger
Let's get that chip kingjames for lakers
Melo should resign
That first game was a fluke
“GET THAT SHIT OUT HERE NIGGA”🤣 gotta love the bubble
Jordan, LeBron, Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Olajuwon, and Shaq:  Check out the 2013-14 book NBA's 50 Greatest Basketball Players of All-time is one of the most extensive  "factual and statistical" references available. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00INWRXWK/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_twi_2?qid=1421293982&sr=8-1
Fuck the Lakers and their fans
Its crazy how losing Aminu and Harkless on defense damaged them so much. They went from contenders to barely making the playoffs even though they got Melo and Whiteside. It shows how important defense is and they should target perimeter defenders this off season
I think melo gonna retire after this smh
A lakers and rockets series looks exiting
Rigged nba last game I’ll ever watch
People saying lajers are winning and there this and that hell they shluld win they got 2 of top 5 players whats so great abt that its not great and next year they get more help nba is a joke there's only like 3 teams that got chance to win chip
LeBron pushes off, off the dribble, every time.
They need to play d. Like the homies in prison playing d to keep the D out of their A.
Danny Green ripping that rebound away and Melo falling over is the highlight of this series.
6:17 *shit outta here nigga*🤣
6:17 "Get out here n****" 🤦🏾‍♂️
The NBA is a whiny band of ignorant, spoiled emo-brats.  They live in palatial, multi-million dollar estates and have the ballless gall to disrespect the United States that gave them the freedom and opportunity to gain such outrageous wealth.   BLM is a militant, Marxist front inciting riots in an effort to overthrow the US constitution: https://youtu.be/_TJpqSZ8ACc   •	Civil rights activist gives perspective: https://youtu.be/1L7JuIEtL7A  •	Facts about Systematic Racism:  https://youtu.be/Z572XopBVFc  •	White people in America are all racist, right? https://youtu.be/5vkaiiMM2sc  •	The hope of the USA:  https://youtu.be/BpJmBVE4vYg
6:16 kuzma say the n word ? lmao
Fucking finally RIP KOBE
“Get outta here nigga” 6:13 kuzma to CJ after he blocks him...  but misses the round and gets scored on >> 😭😂😂
Charles Barkley should never appear on ESPN again❗❗❗✌
that trashtalk from kuzma. "get that outta here n** "
Lebron and AD =2020 Kobe and Shaq
Up&down, Highs&low moments during the 2019-2020campaign for the Blazers, 🎊 to the #LakeShow on the series Dub & thanks for the memories #BlackMamba & #UncleCliffy
Smh can’t believe Stephen A said blazers will take us 7 games 🤦🏾‍♂️ lol cuz we lost game 1 due to dame time.. dame what???  Smh what happened to dame time after game 1🤷🏾‍♂️
It’s so fun watching Carmelo in his bag, the guy just pulls out old school moves so effortlessly
I guess chuck was right about the sweep after game 1
my man carmelo played so well! hope can see him again next season 🙂
Dude, 6:15 am I the only one who caught that? LMAO!
Bye bye dame
Who gives a shit about NBA?
Blazers pure ❤️
Oh you think Lebron played well but don’t worry Skip Bayless will find everything he did wrong on Monday for sure
This is the best you'll get from me. You racist, 2 faced nba.
I really gotta say, lbj is so much better. Those olajuwon workouts, have been working. He got inside game now, a nice left hand now, and a better 3 point shot now. He really is the king!!
GG to lakers just happy to see Melo play like that again man
RESPECT FOR BLAZERS
Lebron James hit that gazer gazer
6:15 "get out here n*gga" XD LOL IM DEAD
lmao 6:16 “get that shit out of here...”😂
CJ got heart ❤️
Honestly this team is better without Lillard if he could play withing the offense and be a more willing passer like CJ they would be better but he does to much CJ had this offense looking smooth tbr I liked them Lillard really makes it look stagnant at times it looks like he has little help then you realize he just thinks he has to do more than he has to and doesn't trust his teammates
The blazers bandwagon is over
Looking at the comments now puts a smile on my face, nothing but respect for both teams
sad to say but melo wil never win a ring but a sure HOF tho
LAKERS!!
Getting rondo back in time for the nxt round and the 2 day rest will be much needed
4:55 best play of the game
6:17 wholesome banter
AD is like KD but with defense and interior game. Minus the cupcake
Is it disrespectful when they call that shot vintage melo? Tsk. 🤣
Melo lookin real good out there 👀let’s hear the haters talk now.
Lbj gettin nice wit the left
AD is the best player in the NBA.
Glad to see basketball but damn it ain't the same.. Must be hard not playing in front of your home fans.. This just feels weird watching
King James was unstoppable.
LEBRON AD IS BEST IN THE LEAGUE 💗 BUT, VINTAGE MELO IS LIT 🥂 WELCOME BACK!
Nobody can't stop king James and AD let's go boyz
Hug to hug comment first
6:15 SHIT OUTTA HERE NIGGA
bucks will win championship mark my word and thank me later..come back on this comment.
rip chuck
JUICED
Nobody:  Nobody at all:  Kyle Kuzma: 6:17 “get outta here n—“
HATERS CRYING 🤣🤣🤣
as i laker fan, i always feel like imma bout to cry whenever i see jr on the floor. such a pain seeing him play, his minutes should belong to dion
6:17 “get that shit outta here nigga” 🤣🤣 dnt know if morris or kuz said it
anyone else here the N word @ 6:15?
markeef morris was mad eshit @6:15
Lmfsoaoaoa why everytime melo shoot a 3 he looks down
I wanna go back and look at the “Blazers in 4” “Clippers fired up Dame to take out the lakers” comments😂
6:15 "get that shit outta here nigga". I love that I can here all that shit talk ! 😂
6:17 “shit outta here n*😂😂😂
Great series by a terrific shooting Blazer team who showed a lot of heart. AD and LeBron might take the Dynamic Duo label away from a certain Gotham tandem
"Get out here Nigga" 6:16 🤣🤣🤣
So........ where is my boy melo signing next year??
Lol so if you play from 6:14 you’ll here CJ sound like he’s saying “ Get That Shit Outta here Nigga” at 6:18
Bron the Real Mvp
Caruso be playing some great defense 💯
Warriors gonna take this series.
Melo is so underrated dude
Just clicked on here to say... If things are so unequal, why don't you give away your millions and try working for a living. Only 1-that's ONE out of 5 NBA players are even registered to vote. Why don't you try preaching your shit in Somalia. How bad is the US again???  #neverwatchnba
This Trail Blazers team needs to be rebuilt.
6:17 "get outta here nigga"
LBJ getting that Laker ring no doubt
I hope Blazers resign Melo, he really found a home.
Bye bye blazers 👋  stay #ME7O in the off-season
I wanna listen without the commentary “ get that shit outa here nigga” 😂
Playoffs Bron and AD were literally just fucking around in an open gym tonight. Props to Blazers though
Thank god they only boycotted one game, I was wondering what Lebron was doing?
Heard the N word alot in this game
DGreen has been trashed since he became a lakers... better give minutes to dion or jr...
are the Playoffs still happening? heard that the season maybe cancelled?
6:16 get outta here nigga
And one n word? 6:22
Lakers in 5
6:18 that was KG’s voice 😂😂😂😂
Anyone else get really annoyed that Melo was going off & they stopped giving him the ball in the third? When the Lakers went on that 13-0 run or something like that? Melo was literally begging for the ball when he was wide open
All hail China
Barkley left the world
If the Suns had bagged that 8th seed things would be a lot more interesting. Not saying they'd beat the Lakers, but getting hot at the right time can still work wonders for a team.
Just happy and proud with Melo. I hope Blazers keep him until he retires.
The haters have been hibernating since game 1. They’ll crawl out of their holes soon as lakers lose a game. Just remember haters, all the greats had to take L’s at some point:) thats why its a series
Am I the only one hears the Wakanda theme?
Prediction: blazers will sweep LAL since winning game 1.  Facts: when LBJ (played wth Cavs) played against Warriors and down 1-3. Still, Cavs able to recover and win, remember??   Game 1 and losing 1 game doesnt mean u get a sweep. #justsaying
When the blazers win in game 1 chuck make a meme with a broom hahaha
Where's chuck barkley.. I guess he left
Damian Lillard wasting his talent in Portland smh 🤦🏼‍♀️
To the blazers fans ,when's game 6? 😂
Happy to see Melo making big buckets
Danm lol 6:17
Skip called it
6:07 AD was definitely robbed of DPOY
2020 MVP-LEBRON JAMES DPOY-GIANNES MIP-LUCA DONCIC 6TH MAN- FRED VANVLET
LeBlazers
CJ played for 46 mins with some back injury
Game 1 blazers looking for un upset,,after game 5 upset is real,,ask Barkley and Pierce
6:18 he gets blocked and says “ get out of here nigga”😂😂😂
LeChina is a BITCH #sellout
不是不打了吗
Who do you think will play in West Finals? Lakers vs _____  I guess it will be LAL vs LAC
6:16 when blazer gets bloked 🤣🤣 get out of here nuka🤣🤣 shit had me weak
wow lebron and ad..
Game 1 was a gift from Lakers hahahah
Carmelo COOKED them tonight CJ and TRENT ballhog and froze Melo out as usual. They refuse to pass the ball Melo was HOT
Ban davis
LeBron is the best. McCollum snapped though:
C.J. a real baller though
That highlight at 8:40 was crazy, the defense into the alley oop...Lakers looking good, seem like they ready to win that chip this year
Go to 5:30 and youll see lebron travel. If you try to slow it down to watch it the frames are literally cut out lmao wtf
I hate LeBron, but if the Lakers don't win it all, I don't wanna hear anything about LeBron and AD. Both carried this series with pretty much no bench (besides game 2 and 4). LeBron and AD gonna do their thing every game, but the rest gotta knock down their shots.
https://youtu.be/klF4O5NH1gA
Man LeBron James and ad the closest thing to shaq and Kobe I've seen in a while
Charles: "I was wrooong...."
Proof money talks
NBA SUX! NO DEFENSE EVER!! LIKE  WATCHING  A REC. LEAGUE  GAME!
Cancun on 3...
What? Didn't that boycott the season?
AD and LBJ did their thing damn the Blazers couldn't beat them 😔
"Ohh, but y'all lost game 1." Then proceeded to smack 4 in a row.  "Oh, but if Lillard was playing" Blew out the Blazers in 2 games while he was playing.  "Oh, well they just an 8th seed anyway" An 8th seed that most niggas were saying could sweep (😂😂) Lakers or upset in 6.  Anymore excuses?
People still gonna be hating on Lebron 🤦‍♂️💀
Finally they play again!
Did anyone else catch that at 6:16 someone said get outta here nigga 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:28 AND ONE NIGGA
❤️❤️❤️
6:18 get out of here n..gga lol i thought they were a bunch of blm activist protesting for a few days
6:16 "get that out of here nigga" *scores anyway* lmao
Nice try haters . Looks like y'all forgot LeBron and AD exist
That first block was painful to watch. I bet he called his mama after the game for some milk and cookies.
Two teams defend like this is an allstar game.
Teams scoring more points cause referee not calling bullshit fouls & doing all that extra shit
Bye bye
Listen to the players at 6:18
Listen 6:17 🤣🤣🤣
@5:00 Melo yelling I got it, just for it to be stolen 🤣🤣
How did ad able to fix his mid range
Lebron in playoff is just fucking  good you can count on this guy!
Kamto2021
Bye 👋🏾 Portland 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾 Hi 👋🏾 haters👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾
Where is the analyst who says that LA will lose in this fiight againts PB?Maybe hes packing his stuff now...fly away get new carrier....lol....
Ye the goat LeBron and we winning this year
Lakers wining the chip
James playoffs mode activated
🔥🔥🔥  Anthony Davis: 43 pts, 9 reb LeBron James: 36 pts, 10 reb, 10 ast
Nice game lakers lebron james,davis,caruso,mgy,moris, kuzma,green,what a solid player in nba
You bums couldn’t just win by 10?
6:15 "Get out of here N****"
Charles Barkley left the chat group
DAME NOT IN A GAME* BLAZERS: IGHT IMMA HEADOUT!!
I think blazers will win this game if Damian Lillard is there
Melo still gotta good 3 years left fr
Damn strong words at 6:30
Melo can’t get out of the first round...what’s new
Damn.. what did Kuz say at 6:19 mark to CJ? 🤣
This might be the last play off game of Carmelo Anthony.
1,2,3 Cancun!! 👏
I saw the full match. Im just here to see dope coments on lakers win. Lol
Bye dame 👋🏽it’s truly sad they did better without him😭
6:25 he says N1 nigga 6:30 he says N1 Nigga Lol this game intense 😂😂
7:25 KOBE💯
Atleast we were lucky enough to see vintage Melo vs BRON... We can't be sure to be hoping that they will matchup again... So enjoy while it lasts ❤️
Yea yea yea lakers win from kobe 👍 🆒 👑
Told ya
Melo playing great.. really redeemed himself from all the previous adversities
Lakers got real problems
What happened to Deon Waiters?
I'm a Blazers fan but oh well, I got some LBJ rookie cards that hopefully will go up in value if he gets another ring.
GET'EM OUTTA,LEGGO @LAKERS 💪🏾💯❤❤
6:17 🤦‍♂️ TNT where yo bleeps at
Dameless Blazers and Lakers still hardly beat them
So happy my team close this series out in game 5. Congratulations. On to the next game, all the best in the next round, I still believe in you guys. Stay healthy and strong, be safe all.
Charles barkley u dont have a ring so stfu
BBQ CHICKEN ALERT
Fuuukkk the NBA and all the fans that continue to support them
6:16 “Get that Sh*t Outta Here N.gga 😭😭
6:17 kuz called him a Nigga 😂
Great comeback run for Melo. Way to prove em wrong💪
LeBron whenever he drives: “🤨foul?” LeBron whenever he fouls: “😯HOW?”
Why lakers are playing? i thought they voted out? I guess money talks louder than their entitled a$$
6:14 I like the trash talk Kuz lol
Would rather seen Suns in this series
Lebron x Wade. Lebron x Kyrie. Lebron x Davis.
Davis is the best 🔥🔥🔥
Bro LeBrons head need work
Trailblazers went out strong 🦾 next season is after corona finna be gas
6:16 Kyle Kuzma “ get that shit outta here nigga” 😂😂😂🤣
Rip haters i wish you all got covid and died😂😂😂😂
Fucking kuzma racist
go lakers!
Congrats Team Lakers and Lebron james
Bron just let the hair go we already know what your head looks like
Where is Lillard?
6:16 🤣🤣🤣🤣
ALM
Good game
6:16 LMFAO
Blazers fans be like " because all of the top players are injured!"   Let me tell you something, availability is the best ability an nba superstar should have. What good are a star player when they're not playing when it counts. Getting paid to sit lol.    Just see derrick rose in the bulls, John wall in the wizards same as bynum with the 76ers. Waste of cap space didnt surmounted to anything and get traded or waived. Except john wall but his time is coming another season ending injury and he done lol.
sigh, no new RDCworld1 video of Lakers i guess
6:17  Didn’t know we could hear this much dialogue.
😡 haters labas na
Lakers taking it this year
Hellooo “Blazers in 7” people!! Why can’t I hear shit from y’all no more? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Melo ballin out here
Minute of silence for people who thought Lakers were going to be swept
Blazers didn’t have their stars and Lakers still struggle smh
#goLBJ! #goAD!
Chuck: "The Blazers will sweep the Lakers! Guarante-" Lebron and AD: "Hold our beers"
lakers are just lucky to be carried by caruso
We all know lakes gone win it all and this coming from a melo fan
Hearing players in the nba say the N word while black lives matter is scrolling by on the court is hilarious
5:00 and 6:18 💀💀💀💀💀
6:14 get that outta here nigga 😭😭😭
The Lakers are too top heavy having to depend on AD and en LeBron entirely too much with no proven third scorer. This works against a subpar team like the blazers  who don't believe in Defense but once they play the Clippers trust me this will come back to back bite them
6:17 we gonna act like we didn’t hear that audio 😂
I don’t see how Houston can deal with the lakers centers the small ball might not work
I can hear Shannon now skkkkkkkkiiiiiiipppppppp goat James did it when u said he couldn’t
was that kuzma? lmao 🤣 6:16
6:16 The beginning of the Kuzma-McCollum rivalry?
Ruso fillin in nice , keep doing yo shit boy . It’s time for Kuz , waiters & Jr to sound Off next round . The starting 5 gone do they shit , but when the bench start popping this train ain’t stopping.
The blazers did better without dane🤨😳
tf is the backround noise
good game
We knew AD and LBJ would show up. But the role players make the difference. KCP, Howard, Kuz, Green and company have done their part throughout this series.
I never thought i'd say the NBA is straight up boring now. I no longer feel interest for it at all first time in my life.
BIG CONGRATS TO ALL LAKERS FANS.. PLEASR SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL
deym they got stuck in 112 in the 4th quarter and that was the difference
Y’all hearing that N word 💀
This Blazers team had a lot of fight in them. CJ left it all on the court with his effort. I think LA underestimated Portland. Despite winning one game they played better than an 8th seed in my opinion.
Cj and carmelo deserve to win. But lebum need more allstars plus the refs to win wkwkwkwkw.
6:17 get that shit out here ni***
6:18 lol “get outta here ni$$a” to funny
Props to LBJ need someone to fact check my lack thereof (laziness) stats Jordan played how many more years in college than Bron bron 4? Jordan was out the league for 2? Years I'm asking is that 6 more years of stats for LBJ than MJ? And for the record king James adored MJ to the point he wanted to be better than him hats off.
Both first seeds lost game 1 then come out and win every other game
Caruso's Teammate Grade is D-  for sure HAHAHHA
When I heard DAME IS OUT I DIDNT EVEN WATCH THE GAME CUZ I KNEW THE LAKERS WAS GANNA WIN THIS GAME..
6:15 is it just me or did he say get outta here nigga😂😂😂
melo with his last playoffs : (
bet chuck had to chuckle 🤣
6:16 get that shit out of here nigga
That showtime ad was weird they should make a movie about bill Clinton  goin to Epstein’s island 98 times 🕺🏽
5:25 was that a travel??
Im usually a fan of Lillards , but him not stickin around a couple more days to Support His Guys was kinda Fuckin Shitty to me.  Ya they were gonna lose , Not The Point . Mr LOYAL (ironically)  BAILED !  Sorry  DAME !   but Dude !  That  Was WEAK !.   Now i wouldnt be surprised if you joined a "$uper Team"  later. !
Lbj wins 1st round west playoffs 3more
Skip to 6:11 and listen 😂😂
Get that shit out of here nigga😂😂
Good win for the Lakers  AD & Lebron putting up historical numbers & Lebron still adding on to his legacy.
They say "Blazers in 4". They did an amazing job anyway. Props to them
Lakers All the way💯💯
Congratulations Lakers, 🤩🤩🤩💖, let's keep moving """"
Lakers all the way! The Blazers have a good roster a lot young talent for  the future. Good series Blazers! See you guys next year.
I love the blazers they played so great. It's too bad they met the Lakers in the 1st round
So what y’all think ? Lakers winning it all? Or no?
6:17 6:28
what the H!!!! is wrong with the background audio man!!!????
6:17 thx me later
Idc what anyone says there was nothing easy about beating the blazers, i dont think the lakers should be discredited just becasue the blazers fought hard and made it a close one
Y’all heard that at 6:17 😂
Dollar was the highlight of the restart with his performances . Coming from a lakers fan
LeBron's a damn machine
6:17 I guess they can use this language, black lives matter thou. it’s a joke.
Big props to the Blazers. From a Lakers fan 💪
Portland Trail Warriors Fans is Crying right now 🤣🤣🤣
Someone said that Blazers have a chance at winning the championship in the game 1 video They did great but That dude was SO wrong
Listen to kuzma at 6:15😂
if you rewind to 6:18 they say the N word
Man without the nba fans the game is bored as aff
6:17 "get out here ni**a"
8 Years Of Drought in Playoffs is Over LET'S Goooo LAKESHOW🏀❤️BUT CREDITS TO BLAZERS THEY GIVE THEIR VERY BEST IN THE SERIES 😌
Someone been watching The Last Dance on Netflix about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls 👀  Showing love from Nashville 🛫
Blazer.. Really no ball moment, everyone want to be a hero, Nurkic need to be on the show Survivor so he can toughen up. Melo barley touch the ball after he made 4 in a row in the early 3rd quarter, keep losing balls trying to dribble through 3 Lakers when 3 blazers players were open, no defense once so ever besides Trent Jr.. Just bad
If the Portland played this well in the whole series plus Dame. It would have been 7 game series. Good moral boost for the lakers. And props to Portland as well for the fighting spirit they showcased during all of their time in the bubble.
6:16 “get that sh*t out of here n****” listen
Bron still looks like he hasn’t even turnt up yet 😭😭he on cruise control playing this well
AD already trashed the blazers back then. Blazers never had the chance to begin with.
"Blazers in 6"
Where the talk now lilosersss i mean lilard
Kuz blocked CJ shit n said "get that shit outta here nigga" Lol
6:13 on Cj drive "Get that shit out of here nigga"
6:16 did he say what i think he did?
Was I the only one who heard what Kuzma said when he got the block on CJ 😂😂
Who else heard Cj say “get outta here nigga” 6:17 😭😭
When the zebras close out their masters' trick.😁
Get outta here “Nigga” 6:15  🤣
6:16 hahaha
Shout-out to the bunch of Nostradamus predictions. 👏👏👏
Old time melo 👌
if you say “Blazers lost because they didn’t have Lillard”, then you probably haven’t seen the whole game, or the series.
Wtf are the refs doing I mean can anybody else but Shebron get a call Sheesh🙄...every time he yell (hey) he got a call what’s really going on? Referees I really disappointed some of you are fans too!! IJS!! Good Game Portland you can’t beat Shebron and the referees💪🏾
I just heard one of the players say the N word.its at like 6:16
So am i the only person who heard Kuzma say "shit outta here n*gga" to Cj when he blocked him and then Cj kept starring him down
Melo: I got it (1000000)  Green: No, I got it
https://youtu.be/CMAp-IMaZk0
are the 2 marcus the same person
The nba is a fucking joke
my parents went to weber state, so since dame was drafted we’ve been supporting him alongside the raptors. both teams played great, but it sucks to see the blazers have tied it, and then be down by 14. to lakers fans, i wish you the best!
lakers fans saying lakers in 5 one week ago: why are you booing me im right!
AHhahahahahaha "get that shyt outta here NEEGGA" anyone else here that? 6:16
Lakeshow won but man, their defense suck!
Go to 6:15
6:16 😂 Kuzma need to be a little quite especially if he gonna let the man Get the Putback for free
6:13  tell me youn hear that 😂
Blazers are a solid squad when healthy . Expect them to be a 4th or 5th seed next season.  Oh ..and Melo did AD so dirty
The Lakers gave chance to Dwight and He proved it!🙏🏼 Happy to see may Idol❤
Is it me or did he just say ...              “Twitter Thumbs” 😂😂
Bye Melo
No one care about da nba no more lmao
Good game
Congrats LAKERS. King LBJ👑🐐👏👍
Let’s go Lakers do it for Kobe but the Blazers played their hearts out and I hate they have to go home empty handed nothing but respect
6:16 This is not what you want to hear haha.
4:59  😂😂😂
Wow Lebron is like 35 and still averages triple doubles “Momma look at this man”
6:08..💪💪💪
Damian Lillard: AFK
Blazers put up a good fight against us, respect. #LakersNation
Loving AD🔥
So no one gonna talk bout Melo performance? Wow that man did his thing out there‼️
Rockets-Lakers who ya got folks? Lakers in 6?
Dame needs to leave..or end up just like his teammate Carmelo.. good career, no rings !!
dame time let's go!😏
Lakers vs. Suns would have been an interesting series.
Lebron has been in his prime since he was in his prime. He never left. 🤣
Nice game blazers ... even w/out dame you still fight to the hardest #respect
7:06 dude even faked me! I thought the ball was gonna go to the corner
LAL vs HOU will be a good series.
2nd round: lal vs hou  Rockets at 6 😔
My top 5 All-Time Lebron Kobe Mj ShaQ Kareem
The Lakers should have picked up melo idiots
Damn kuz😂 6:13
This was a great series for both teams and damion lillard gave it everything he got my cap goes of to him and how hard his team played but the lakers dominated after game one and won four straight and off to the next round let’s go lakers 💛💜❤️🙏💪
Carmelo anthony will  never beat the lakers in the playoff!
lma kuzma at 6:16
C Webb as commentator is very bias clearly leans on the Lakers..
Told everybody lakers was gon kill these niggas.. they got caught up in game 1. Lakers gon win it all.
Good read Melo, and good read LBJ.7:16
The sad truth is that the Blazers needed their ENTIRE team to beat the Lakers. Even when Dame was playing, the team was still missing guys who were important. Then Dame dislocated a finger. Then he went all the way out. CJ was playing with a broken back.   Once you have that many things going wrong, you're not beating Bron and AD.
6:16  get outta here n____
lakers won but kcp will be lakers downfall in the playoffs he;ll do the classic 1 pt 1 reb 1 assists
Where is Barkley
Props to Melo
The talk on the court 😂😂😂 awww man
Danny green still sucks tho
6:16 lmao. Just listen
6:17 someone needs to get fined here.
Nice Game 👌
AD  43, 9, 4, 77%. He’s playing mycareer
This was just a highlight, yet the number of fouls not called for the blazers was just outrageous. And yet LeBron still has a free card to shove players with his hand all the way to the basket. And yeah I know, I'm a hater. The referees must be the good guys
I’m Sorry but CJ’s bag is just so FILTHY 🤷🏽‍♂️
anyone else hear that dude say get outta here nigga lmfao
We always eliminate Portland from the playoffs. Go LAKERS!(
Man how soft is Nurkic you are seven foot and you are taking jump shot in paint rather than going and dunk on everyone.
Listen at 6:17 and little further 😀
6:16 "Get outta here nigga" 😂😂😂
Well should have let the grizzlies play i think it would hVe been a better game 😂
Where’s Barkley and his broom?
Get that shit outta here nigga!👌💯
Laker Fans moving forward if Lebron James is not the best player on the floor, they will not win.
6:16 “GET OUTTA HERE NIGGA”
Lillard will be traded soon...to the Lakers
Chuck: "The Blazers will sweep the Lakers! Guaranteed!!"  Haters: "Yeah, the Lakers are so bad in the bubble, Blazers is a different team, they playing like a top seed! 1st round exit for Lebum, AD is soft! No chemistry Lakers, Overrated team"  Me: 🤷
rips in the chat for the blazers. :(
Panalo Lakers talo s plus s pustahan  laki Kita ni LeBron s gambling at Ng Lakers team bintahan Ng laro
They really got us in the first half of this series
6:18 “ Get outta here nigga” - Kuz 😂
Respect to Dame and the Blazers!And i mean it. Lakers wrap it up tonight but Portland played against them very well. Dame,CJ,Nurkic are the only three players in my opinion to be safe in overhauling this team. Run by 2 PG's, missing a consitent and able 3rd scoring options and the push deeper in the playoffs/finals will be some reasons to tinker.
Bron with another 30 10 10  14/19 FG% 4/7 3pt% Made it look easy   Where the haters now...
can't stop lebron, when he wanted to score
Melos last game..
Go sub to @DoodaTV
6:16  "get outta here n-" 😂😂😂
Said and done 1st round
Charles BARKley: Portland trail blaizers will sweep LA Lakers..  Me: 🤔🤔🤔
Respect for MELO🤟👍 WELLDONE BLAZZZZERS. GRATZ LAKE🤟
LeBron (FiRsT RoUnd UpSeT) lmaooo. Overacting media.....
Blame time
“Blazers on 5” didn’t age well
Kuzma at 6:16: "get outta here nigga"
Damn this shit just ended
I had the Lakers in 6. I had the opportunity to change after game 1 and stayed with Lakers in 6. Who woulda thought I should've picked them in 5.
Yes Dame can shoot. But now see what happens when he doesn't always hit those deep threes like Chris smoove said. For the moment yeah he's making em, but he won't always make em
Wheres the Broom?
I’m not trying to hate but is Whiteside an ok like this man turns the ball over every time he dribbled and was baited in almost all fouls like he looks like a guy who is tall that plays basketball not an nba player like he looked like an amateur maybe cause the lakers played that well but if I’m Portland I might try to trade him
6:16 who else heard that 😂
“Get that outta here nigga”😂😂😂 Kuz meant that
4:58 melo 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂
Panalo sana sila kung nglaro si MANG DAMIAN
Free Hong Kong!  Say it LeBron SAY IT
Well, congrats to the lakers... let’s see if they can get past the second round... might be a tough one.
How many time lebron finish with that left hand? Looks too easy for him. Haha
This is why I've hated the Blazers since the 90's. They couldn't win this one for Uncle Cliffy?
Lakers fan here, gotta say the blazers played amazingly without dame and everyone else, if they would’ve played like this every other game with them they could’ve won, but still nothing but respect for these guys. Got high hopes for this team next year.
PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS ELIMINATED FROM THE PLAYOFFS
What now Chuck? 🤣
Who else heard someone say nigga?
Cancel the NBA!!
omg portland would actually be scary with dame
Man i hope cj would go to finals someday.  You see his effort to win the game
Where's Damn?
6:10 lmao
Bye bye milo
This game felt like 2009 because Melo and Bron firing back at each other
No way... the crazy rebellion by the nba is over after one game I’m sure LeBron wants to support BLM more than another ring for His ego. Lmao joke
Where you at, Michael Rapaport?
NAH THESE FUCKING ADS GOTTA GO
Wait, people are watching the NBA?
People are gonna say the samething about the Lakers when they Play the Rockets in the Next Round. Im Sure the Rockets will punch the lakers in the mouth Game 1 just for the lakers to tapped that ass in game 2 and so on AND TO GO ON TO WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS . BOOK IT FOLKS
I’m excited to see family in the bubble. I think it’s gonna really boost the level of play I feel
Only Blazers can beat Lakers got wrecked up😂
Blazers put up a fight. If they get 1 more good big man and Trent continues to develop then they could be contenders
Its over when Jared Dudley starts playing
Did anyone hear kuz @ 6:17 LOOOL
Portland is gone, We're off to the second round
J r think they a next game 😂😂
6:15 kuzma with the kind of choice words ive been hoping to hear without the crowd noise. laughing so hard im crying emoji laughing so hard im crying emoji laughing so hard im cryinbg emoji
I guess Shaq won the battle Rap..he predicted Dame's future lmao
And some people still saying that "if dame wan not injured, portland would come back from 3-1!" lemme tell you, these people are clowns!
thanks blazers for the warm up. now we need to face the rockets! let's go lakers
Respect CJ, the man was balling but they couldn't stop AD and Lebron
Yes sir
What happened Blazers fans? Y'all got so hype after game 1.
Blazer fans thought they had a chance lmao
And they wanted to see the blazers over my Grizzlies play the Lakers we could have won a game or two this series was lame blazers never stood a chance against the lakers even with dame,cj,and Carmelo Anthony
Get that shot outta here nigga 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lillard should get out while he’s still young
PORTLAND Trailblazers 122 vs 131 LOS ANGELES Lakers
Lets go Lakers!!!
Respect to both teams but it looks like the Blazers we’re playing dirty or were they too desperate to stay alive in the series
who said the n-word at 6:17? or did i just heard it wrong
Melo at 5 mins into the vid LOL
Lebron is a beast, AD is a beast and Caruso is starting to become the 2nd best defensive player but in tonight's game I think he had at least 10 steals
Dame time to go home. Really blazers sweep laker hahaha
Fuck the blazers is James Time
Melo was embarrassed asl after getting striped "I got it I got it"😂
Carmelo "I GOT IT I GOT IT AWH SHIT" Anthony
I know y’all heard what kuzma said 🤣🤣
Great job Lakers💜💛
I’m the goat
Lebron is going to turn into 2018 Bron for the rest of the playoffs and win the chip
Chris "I'll tell you what" Webber
Blazers fans, do you want to talk about it? Nah jk nothin but respect for Portland
6:16 " get out here nigga " hahaha
Lebron must be really happy for having a good teammates unlike on Cleveland

I doubt anyone else will say it so I will. Congratulations LA. I though the Blazers would get swept but I guess you guys felt bad for us. That was a fun series and I hope you guys will go on and win it all.
Nah not worth my waist of time
Paul Pierce gave Chuck his power of Prediction
6:16 "Get outta here nigga" 🤣🤣
Lol Blazers always going out sad in the playoffs
GG
basketball is  the best. I play a ton of Basketball.
Time to break up Dame and CJ it doesn't work 😂
I don't see Dame eh
Wow its crazy that the blazers played better without lilard 👀 also I wish the lakers would have played Dallas. I think dallas would have beaten them..
Where Lillard go?
Rockets in 4
Legend has it, Chuck is still waiting for the sweep
cool video. go jazz and blazers
True heart here
6:17 “Get out here ni****” 🤣
AYE LAKERS💪🏾✊🏿💪🏾✊🏿💪🏾✊🏿💪🏾✊🏿✊🏿💪🏾✊🏿✊🏿💪🏾✊🏿💪🏾✊🏿💪🏾💪🏾✊🏿
FBLM
Let’s gooo baby!!!
Seems like that "Blazers will upset Lakers" didn't age well.
1st Half: Defense has left the Chat
this is not the time for blazers..
Props to CJ McCollum who fought hard for this game and hands down to LBJ and AD this duo is on another level woaaah!  Gotta give credit to Carushow for his hustle and energy. Nice game! Let's Go Lakers!  Let's get the ring for Kobe!
Both played for there legends and what an entertaining game!
clips taking chip
6:14 listen to Kuzma LMFAO
This Game was history. Lebron is now tied for 3rd all time in playoff games played, and is now 2nd in playoff games won
Mad respect for Blazers But yeah it was always lakers in 5.
Check me out on the tube ASAP it’s lit 🔥
They did better without lillard
Volume up, 6:16 listen to kuzma lol
Oh chuck.  How wrong he was.
6:17 " get outta here nigga" 😭🤣🤣
And people thought blazers was taking it 😂😂
God luck Lakers Glingan nyu due Davis james
Blazers in 9
6:17 and 6:29 ???
9:00 lands so long before he shoots, travel
Anthony Davis went to the buffet tonight boi.....
Charles Barkley really pulled a Paul Pierce.   Let that sink in
Blazers: “I don’t wanna be here”
Happy the players decided to keep the season alive. Hope they can find a way to create change while providing entertainment for us at home. Props to them
Who heard kuz say get that outta here nicca
0:29 That annoying 2K cam lol
6:17 “get outta here n*gga” 6:28 “and 1 n*gga”
Low key, I thought blazers was gonna win but I still went for lakers Even tho  Damian Lillard did good, I think blazers did good still.
4 down 12 to go
Lakers vs Rockets gonna be sick
Each like is for Chadwick Boseman
Davis and James combined for 79...... holy shit 😭
Blazers gonna upset the Lakers tho right??
Father Time will catch up to you  Lebron & Tom Brady - “bet”
LILLARD why did u let your team down
Get back to work.  Dont bring politics into ball or any sports. Do your jobs.
👍 ON TO THE NEXT ONE !!!!!!!         GA GA
Dame needs to leave Portland. Respect for his loyalty but he’ll never be a champ there
Playoff Brow and Playoff Bron. You love to see it
7 years of not making the playoffs how times have changed bring it home boys 💜💛
4:58 Carmelo Anthony “I GOT IT I GOT IT!!” also Carmelo Anthony *proceeds to fall and give up the ball*
4:58 MELOOOOOOOO
Good Series Everybody. In my opinion, Blazers would have lost in 6 or 7 but injuries happen.
This Social Justice Plan sounds like planned opposition to me 🤷 You know, kind of like you can put this but not that on your jersey 😐
The marathon continues into the western semis. The Blazers played fantastically, but some quirks and the DAME injury really set them apart after Game 4. No doubt an entity despite being the eighth seed. Gotta give my props to AD x Bron, and for the others in the rosters into getting it done tonight.. #ForTheChip 💜💛
blazers sweeping
Dame thought he could beat Bron and AD
Give some respect to the blazers even though they were outmatched I gotta applaud them for all the effort I saw in these 5 games
Respect Blazer 👍
good luck to the lakers for round 2!
Should’ve been a sweep. Glad the blazers woke up the Lakers in Game 1. We comin💜💛🏆.
Kuz trash 🗑
The one who can read this will be successful one day.🙏
Watching Melo and LeBron guarding each other today is a blessing! #melonuggets
Cue in the video of Nurkic 's flying kiss after the dagger dunk from game 1.  LMAO
Gg Blazers.
Come again Charles?
I remember when people said the blazers were going to win in 4 games
Who wich melo was on the lakers
for a moment it seemed that there will be game 6 but then the refs took over with a barrage of non sense calls...
Bron haters hella mad rn 😂
I remember when people said Lakers were gonna lose and that they are overrated. Fucking dumbasses
Welcome to the Carushow!
Blazers played hard to get here nothing but respect
You know how much money Chuck lost betting on the blazers to sweep the Lakers??     $50k 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
It's "dame no more time"
Who is the best NBA player?
NBA trash
Who y’all got in the Celtics vs. Raptors series is the real question...that series about to be insane
Props to Caruso! Dude plays with so much energy.
Damn it’s way sadder to watch teams go home this year. Knowing how much they sacrificed to be there and going home empty handed
Props to the Portland Trail Blazers! They played really well even if they came up short! Congrats to the Lakers tho
Youtube, you so fast. Lakers onto next round. #2020Champs
Lakers will win the 2020 Championship.
Damn Lebron! He's turning 36 yrs old this year in his 17th season and still performs like this. Gotta say we just witness greatness again.
Props for the blazers for having an incredible bubble performance
Length of lakers will be deep.
Nice WIN Lakers!!! 💜💛 #OnToTheNextOne 🏀💪
I wonder who will take on L.A  Houston or the thunder it would be good series
Always bet on the team opposite to what sir charles predicts will win and you might become a millionaire in no time😂
Bron gotto let that hair go man just embrace it already 😂
F I R S T
Damian" Its dame time!! Bron" yeah to go home!!
I hope the 1% that reads this will follow their dreams and never give up. My dream is to become a successful Youtuber.
Spoiler Lakers win the championship for Kobe💜💛
My dad has this old shirt that says "thank goodness for sports, without them we'd be stuck talking about politics!"   Sigh
Congratulations to the Lakers, but the Blazers also deserved a hard earned respect as well.👏
Buddy, the refs not 6’4”, he’s not 8 inches shorter, bruh
0:40 ankle breaker
*Great Series guys. Congrats to the Lakers*
When lakers lose people hate on Caruso, but that man plays with so much energy and appreciation for the game man, he really out there hustling. Y’all gotta start appreciating these role players
Rip black panther😔🥺😢 Rio Chadwick Boseman☹️🥺❤️😭
Skin lng ni gus
That was fast
Anthony Davis  43 PTS - 9 REB - 4 AST - 78% FG  LeBron James  36 PTS - 10 REB - 10 AST - 74% FG  Best duo in the league
Im very confused why the 6th best player in the world 🌎 is getting wide opens dunks so constantly
Win for Kobe and Chad 🏆
lakas ng LBJ AD
Charles Barkley looking worse than Paul Pierce people gotta understand Lebron James doesn't get eliminated in the first round never.
Lebron played like a king man & Ad’s a fucking beast!
Who says blazers can outplayed lakers. Hahaha
Portland sucks below the belt.🤗
The Lakers play for kobe Bryant  The blazers play for cliff Robinson  These two teams play for the loss of these two legends  RIP kobe Bryant  RIP Clifford Robinson
yall so fast
Where ya boys at!?!?!
I really hope melo gets a ring. Can't believe people said he was washed smh.
DAME TIME LASTED FOR 1 GAME
Here b4 the bots tho
The 2020 NBA Champions Los Angeles Clippers.
Lol, the people who said the Blazers would sweep after game one looking dumb now!
1st
If you came straight to the comment run me my likes please
LeBron is a demigod sent from the future
I'm not first I'm not last  But most importantly,  Nobody asked
Lakers Taking it Home Baby!!!!!!!
Blazers overcame so many adversities and still clinched the 8th seed. Nothing but respect for those guys.
1st haha
Lebron dominate and caies 36 10 and 10
The “blazers gonna upset lakers” crowd real silent rn
GG portland
Lebron is a straight up cheat code
We all knew it was gonna be a sweep, or gentlemen’s
Atlast a replay of highlights of lakers vs blazers.
The Lakers aren't gonna win the championship if Kuzma is gonna play like he did today, I mean c'mon 3-12 😂
*I GIVE YOU PLAYOFF LEBRON!*
Hehe haaah mmonkee
Dame Time= Time For Another Early Round Exit 😉
Lebron is getting ring #4
G LAKERZ!! XP
Props to the Blazers for keeping this game close most of the 4th with no Lillard 💯
LAKERS WIN !. 💜💛
first
Blazers play better when injured!😭
l
Frst comment
Early
first
F in the chat for blazers fans
Yeah Bron definitely catching Kareem on that scoring list. Might establish his self as the 🐐.
Let’s gooo lakers
I got Houston In 6 or 7 because of the 3pt shooting difference. And also because Russ dropped 40 on LAL. Houston won and it was the 1st game of small ball. And nobody can really guard Russ and Harden.  But Who y'all got tho???
