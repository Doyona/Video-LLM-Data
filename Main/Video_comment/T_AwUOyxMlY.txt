It’s crazy without that fumble they’d be 0-7 against Mahomes
4 years later, hi haters! WE THE BEST!
Sadly, it was the Ravens’ one and only win against the Mahomes-led Chiefs.
BENGALS ALL THE WAY
4:07 3rd and 39 is wild
Me
Had to come back and watch this for at least some joy considering the chiefs are attempting 3peat now -_-
Such a great win!
11:35 off topic but one of the worst bailout calls I've ever seen
Who’s here in 2025
Hopefully Lamar and the Ravens step it up vs KC in the AFCCG this year.
I had to revisit this because after this 1 for the Ravens it's been all Andy Reid and the Chiefs
Chiefs are the luckiest team in the world even when they play against one of the worst QB's in the league. Lucky.    Reply
Honestly they did pretty good considering the Chiefs offense
Who is here watching this vid for film on Mahomes?
Man, Lamar loves throwing INT's into triple coverage vs. the Chiefs. Only time Lamar has beat the Chiefs he got outplayed badly by Mahomes. Only reason they lost was because of Clyde fumbling in field goal range at the end of the game smh.   Lamar- 239 yds, 1TD, 2INT's (and one on a 2 pt conversion in addition to that) 78.8 rating.  As opposed to Mahomes 343 yds, 3TD 1INT 131.5 rating.   It'll be interesting to see what happens on Thursday. The Chiefs so far have Lamar's number bigtime. Mahomes has owned him in these matchups.
2024 season opener is this magnificent rematch. No matter purple or red, it’s gonna be a hell of a game. LFG
Yea my ravens in for a rude awakening but this without saquan
That throw at 2:10 so stupid 😂
Crows should have lost this one also.
3:12 Triple Coverage, the same interception to lose against chiefs in the 2023 AFC Championship 🤣🤣😆😆
Came here to see why ravens anit go with this game plan that won them this game u see how much they running that ball Dawg they ran the ball so much and u see how they was moving down the field why did they stop doing that and look at the time of possession it was way higher than the chiefs and this is how u beat Mahomes Ima be real doesn’t Lamar seem more comfortable this game more than the AFC Championship game
Who is here because the AFC championship game is in 22 minutes???😂
There only one man to stop the swifts
Stop trolling me Google.
Imagine... this was when the chiefs were at their best...and still lost. Lamar only had Andrews and still put up 36 Pts!!! Ravens will win by 20  this time!!!
Save the soul society Lamar 🙏(I will never stop believing in you Lamar)
Chiefs gonna take this one. If you’re here for the AFC championship game this weekend DON’T THINK IT IS SWEET!
AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. This will be different
Re-watching this getting prepared for this Sunday's game. I hope it's just as exciting as this or more.
That 11:15 ineligible receiver call made me want to look again… still think wow
I’m trying to figure out what happen to Hardman 🤷🏾‍♂️
Ravens win 34-13 against Chiefs #AFCChampionship  #AfricanStoriesRetold
This gone be ravens again but this time for the afc championship Sunday ravens got way better offense and defense this year it’s over ravens winning championship 🏆#Ravens2024Champions🏆
YouTube is becoming worse than TV
He played badly in first half and the ravens personnel and schemes on offense and defense were poor in this game.  Yet they still won.  I don’t see this weekend going any differently, Ravens by 2 scores or more with improved personnel, schemes, home field advantage, and a better version of Lamar
I’m here getting idea what Sunday is gonna be like Cheifs must be stopped
i miss honey badger 💔
Youtube...way too many commercials bro
Here doing parlay research👁️
Bro the move at 8:19 😰 wtf
See y’all Sunday 🤧🐦‍⬛
Chiefs 27 ravens 17
If the Bills couldn't beat the Chiefs, the Ravens are gonna struggle. But regardless, I just want a good game ❤️💛
Sunday cant come soon enough 😈 🐦‍⬛
And It’s gonna happen again  🐦‍⬛
Who's here for the championship game!!!
This game had me at the edge of my seat back in the day! Lamar gotta win Sunday, we do not want to see a Taylor swift super bowl
too many ads bruh
9:34 ❤❤❤❤
8:20
4:07
Fumble was the difference in the game wow.
This is gonna be the greatest championship game of all history
First game in Baltimore with fans in 20 months and first win ever against the modern-day Patriots. I’m here hoping to find some reassurance that the Ravens can do it again to KC considering this is, incredibly, the teams’ most recent meeting. But both teams have changed so much since then. Jackson has grown as a QB and the Ravens defense is much better. Of course KC also has a much improved defense.
8:19 crazy elusive
Looking back at this game for film study for the AFC Championship and Lamar looks like a ROOKIE QB here compared to 2023 Lamar Jackson.. The GROWTH is real! We got a New OC/DC, REVAMPED linebackers, DLine, secondary, and receivers. The chiefs LOST their OC, and their second best player. This should be a BREEZE!
2:10 Mahomes is the best I’ve ever seen, wtf is this throw 😂 insane
Exciting game. Lamar vs Mahomes is every bit as exciting as Allen v Mahomes. First time they meet in the playoffs. Difference is Lamar has improved since the last time they squared off and the Chiefs defense has never game planned for Lamar in a Todd Monken offense. That means they’ll have to respect Lamar more as a passer, even while their defense is weak against the Ravens’ strength which is rushing. Spagnuolo has his work cut out for him to figure out how to stop Lamar in Monken’s offense. Will be very interesting to watch what his game plan will be. Sell out to stop the run and keep Lamar in the pocket? I’m anticipating a lot of blitzes being thrown at him, but that leaves Andrews, Flowers, Likely, and/or OBJ 1v1.
Anyone came back to watch this epic game to see whats in store for this Sunday?
This was last time they played each other. Who’s here for the afc championship?
Who all came back to review this game
Here’s to hoping we have another classic on Sunday. Would be great for the neutral fans but maybe not for my mental health.
Whos here because they about to play in the playoffs
2024 AFC Championship
Mind you the last time they met here the Ravens had lost a majority of its starters due to ACL tears and the defense was no where near as great as they are now. This is a game for the Ravens to lose
AFC championship finna go crazy

Can't wait for next week 💪
No honey badger so that pick won’t be there and Lamar way better now ravens winning
Go Ravens 🫡

I came back to watch this game to remind me that we are a better team now, it’s 2024 playoffs, let’s have the same results. Although I don’t think it will be this close.
Who’s here now that the AFC Championship will officially be between the chiefs and the ravens?
Raven Flock

AFC Championship 2024
2023 AFC Championship game.
I have forgotten how good the Chiefs offense looked and how bad their defense was. Its kind of flipped now.
This game was on my birthday and I'll never forget it. Amazing game it was like a movie. RAVENSSSS
coming back to this game, Lamar is still RAW after all those injuries from the team this awful year yet his raw skills and his talent around him still beat a polished Chiefs team...2023 Ravens are near complete team and Lamar has been redefined even better.
team ravens i have bin a fan for a 1year i am still one
Lucky for tht day
So, this was Tucker's one miss of the season? If so, great timing.
"BALLS OUT!" call @ 13:37 and BALLS OUT play call @ 14:02
2024 AFC Champinship game.
If they match up in playoffs ravens will win again
Watching this two years later shows me that Greg Roman wasn’t it 💀
Was at this game. First game back with fans since covid and I can say it's the most electric crowd I've ever been to and I've been to over a dozen Ravens games
8:18 apppppppppreciate 8
We can debate all day Lamar better then mahomes 💯💯
GO RAVENS!
I love the Ravens.
9:40
This game was crazy, it shows the good Lamar and the bad Lamar.  Some great throws and runs, and some really bad picks but gutted it out vs the best.

GO Baltimore RAVENS Win!
Let’s go 🎉
Wow
Why would he pass it to the end zone and his WR was fully covered by three defenders? Totally insane 😳
The energy in that stadium was CRAZY. One of the most electric games I’ve ever been to
Ravens: Win. NFL: Puts Mahomes on the cover anyway.
Pay lamer
What a W to this day💜🖤
you've got to admira Mahomes' arm strength... now look at the pass for the 2nd touchdown for the Chiefs
I love Jackson he's nr 1!!
11:37 Lamar is a top 5 QB 🤓
“HIM”🥷🏿💜🖤🐐
I remember getting back from the cowboys chargers game and watched this game at the bar amazing
Picked off by guess who, Mathieu- Al Michaels.
After losing to Mahomes and the Chiefs for what? 3 years in a row, the way I felt after this win was like when I first saw this team hoist the Lombardi
Went up against the boogey-man and won. Gives me chills every time!
I know I’m not there only one waiting to watch some ravens football
The Ravens didn't let the score or the success of the mighty Chiefs slow them down or stop them from getting this victory.
One of the best seasons since I been watching football
I’ve been a Kansas fan for I year and I can’t believe they make it to the championship
Hi
Not a Ravens fan, but glad they got the win
If Baltimore was healthy this would've been the AFC title game
Oweh owner of KC
Ravens now own mahomes
9:22
Why are so many people only giving credit to Lamar the defense carried to

I couldn’t believe it that night. We finally beat the chiefs
I've watched this video and it turns out that if the Ravens haven't made that field goal attempt, my Chiefs would definitely won for sure. Final score would be: -Chiefs: 35 -Ravens: 33
If only Clyde didn’t fumble😭
Best regular season Game this year. Bills vs Chiefs is game of the Year though.
Chiefs could make it to Superbowl
No kizzy this season have been absolutely crazy and insane
Favorite game ever
RAVENS FANS. REMEMBER TO KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY. HAHA
wanna think every person in the nfl would doubting us.. #flocknation
Favorite game ive ever watched
greatest victory of the ravens since sb 2013
CEH the fumble that cost me $30k.
And I just love listening to my quarterback your quarterback doesn’t talk
Big ending
So why do y’all take out Patrick Mahomes
Here 4 cheifs highlights
I was at this game. Baltimore went crazy that night.
I was at this game. Baltimore went crazy that night.
Ufvg
Lamar FINALLY won his game against Patrick. He can thank the Super Bowl Hangover and the Madden Curse for that! Remember Ravens fans, one lucky point gave you the win. Wait until next year, #ChiefsKingdom ! We coming back
Ravens need better defensive players
ravens were literally just jogging
love that Sammy Watkins checked in at RB for the final kneel down
The ravens do really well in comebacks
The ravens running game is insane
This is the game that ended the Chief’s career for the rest of the season 😂
why would the nfl allow a play to be repeated after OL holding plus the penalty? I think it should be automatic 2nd down!!
Y’all got a new field design and new cameras ( the quality) 👁
The announcer didn't do justice to this game. Get someone on who's more excited about football.
wow ... jackson bring he's A game even 2 interception hehehe ... keep it up LJ
The Ravens need to make Tyson Williams the number 1 RB again!
Beat Mahomes ✔
What happened to the audio?!
8:20 "wow " is right. Dude broke 4 tackles with ease.. Appreciate this man

damm wish i could watched it live but i was passed out cause i work graves. lamar threw two picks...b but besides that played crazy. ivd been rooting dor him when his games are on ever since jaxson he won the highsmen
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Stephen A. “Irritated” Mahomes loses to Jackson.  Still proceeds to slob on his knob, like corn on the cob after he loses.
Sammy Watkins beating his old team

Awesome game!
Slap
Ravens need a new coach and new gm , good game tho
4:09 Look at Oweh on this play. dude is gonna be an issue
I am winning money off the chiefs every one think there a good team but I am the only one think they Suspect 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 go browns.
Any bronsexuals here..🤔🤔
We beating the Chargers today❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
Dude the referees are chiefs fans
This is what usually  happens.  A team is really good for a few years until the other teams take there off season seriously and watch them and teams start figuring out the chiefs game plan happens alot. Chiefs are still one of the best if not the best in the NFL but I'm just saying expect other teams to start giving en a harder time than usual.
Lamar Jackson MVP candidate
As bad as it sucks to lose this one, the offensive line for the Chiefs looks great so far (outside of a few bad plays). Definitely looking better than last season.
This game was EPIC ..... I am a Lamar fan... don't live in the city at all. But I like me some lamar!!
“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” Acts 4:12 Jesus is the only way we can be saved, not Allah, Buddha, only Jesus Christ
They fought for everything in this game.
mahomes is good but goddamn those ravens are relenteless, never give up, never surrender!!!!!! it ain't over until its over.
Galatians 5:16 King James Version 16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
Defensive ends are not made in an off-season.
Who edits these videos? You don't show replays of awesome throws, but show the ref calling an illegal formation on a meaningless 2nd and 10? Even worst, the "highlight" video doesn't even show the beginning of the play so we can't even see the illegal formation. Come on man!
Travis Kelce should get some blame for completely half assing his block and allowing that dude to come in and punch the ball out from helaire
damm CHiefs run defense sucks again
Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr
Lamar is lethal agility but reads on passing needs get better
Incredible games this year
If i subscribe to the NFL on Youtube, will I be able to watch it on youtube. and will I have to sign a contract?
Mais que merecido a Vitória do RAVENS💜🔥🔥🔥
I was mad when dude fumble the ball Chiefs was suppose to win this Game it hurts.
Wow... Chiefs lost due to a dumb fumble.... I'd be extra sick if I were a chiefs fan, if this was a post season game... Losing like that when you're in FG range is just sickening
今のＮＦＬの若手最高峰ＱＢ対決で個人技がＮＦＬ最高峰のジャクソンとＮＦＬ史上完成されたＱＢのマホームズの対決は何度見ても楽しいし  是非ともスーパーボウルで見たい対決です
way to go ravens
It really bugged me that the commentators didn't know that a pass has to make it back to the line of scrimmage to avoid intentional grounding. It didn't matter that Mahomes was outside the tackles.
awesome game
what a game, many mistakes by kc but wow the ravens hung in there and came back, although tim not a big fan of the flips and cartwheels after the touchdowns
Nice pass from the talented Lamar Jackson!
Jackson throwing into three guys and getting intercepted - he got to stop doing that. Mahomes falling throws instead of taking the sack - sometimes he has to stop doing that.
Ravens won with far worse offensive stats.  Pretty amazing.
Jackson is a Iiving legend  he is the reason y watch nfl
Chiefs will redeem themselves....      they have too
Ravens better win the Super Bowl. Also Lamar did his thing hope it pans out in long run
Imo I don’t think Mathews is all that great. All he does is sit in a zone. No skill in that
The ravens were 0-3 against the chiefs coming into this game. I think the chiefs could've won if not for CEH fumble.
Blood Crip gang 💙🧡🤍
Holy Ghost
Ha ha motherfucjers I own you all now
This game made Lamar the biggest paid player in the game!
I love watching the Chiefs lose

AFC Championship Game preview.
Came here to see the wide open wr mahomes has.. for his 76 competition percentage...
Lamar Jackson carried his team to a W. Full credit
I love the way Lamar Jackson runs. Buttery smooth and great acceleration.
This is the championship pregame.
What a close game 🔥🔥🔥
This video has like 20 ads lol
Is it me or did Lamar Jackson just pull a mahomes on mahomes this guy is insanity
Lamar to Mathieu for 6!
Great game bit all mynails off go Baltimore
Lamar been playing like this madden n he dont know how to use his own team
Patrick Queen sucks
Lamar is goated
KC needs a lot of work on their defense.  Ravens D is bad also…. Browns will light that defense up.. both teams have a lot of work to do.
Damn what a game!! Brilliant!
Don't watch that much football mostly basketball. Lamar Jackson is fun to watch though.
12:51 textbook
LOL
If it was Brady they wouldn't have called intentional grounding @3:47
why do American commentators suck.
Chiefs offense will have to score 40 a game with this shitty defense
That's what they get!
30th ranked defense
Damn good game!
If #70 didn't have that block the ravens would've lost
What happened to undefeated this season chiefs?! Lol even with lamar throwing 2 picks they still lost. Mahomes threw a pick too just like baker did in thier game. What a game though. Ravens looking good this season.
This game was waay better then watching the damn emmys
Coming from a cowboys fan we gotta play one of these fools later on in the season
GREAT game!
It’s weird that I’m from California and am a ravens fan

How do you throw a pick 6 and then throw into triple coverage in the same game?
Remember Chiefs fans, Us Raiders beat these guys.
Lamar Jackson with the Madden inzone flip
replayed 2:56 so many times 😂🤣
Ravens went from weak to berzerk from the raiders to the chiefs game WOW. and I say that as a raiders fan.
Game of the Year ?????
chiefs will lose again if they can’t stop the run game
Patrick Mahomes dumps the ball off and the receivers all make +20 of run after catch with a host of moves. Mahomes gets most the credit for that but those receivers (and TE) put in work.
what a game
RAVENS!!! ✌🏻🥳💜
8:20 one of his best rushes this game
Who’s still boycotting the NFL? I feel sorry for ya mudder
Jackson is on a different level.
Chiefs are in big trouble, you can't think you're gonna outscore everybody, giving up 30 plus points a game ain't gone cut it.
今シーズン最高のゲーム、お互いに最高のパフォーマンスだった。
What do you think about the last 4th and 1 and going for it? I would have punt it away
2 false starts are highlights? Who is making this videos?
Best start to an nfl season in my lifetime. The prime time games have been unbelievable !!!
Swear everytime I see that ad tellin me I can’t skip , I close the damn app. 😂☠️ don’t tell me I can’t skip lol
Nice 👍🏾
game of the year and it’s only week 2
Thanks Baltimore for beating the Chiefs for us
Is it just me or was CEH a reach by now? He is just not very good.
Kansas defense hopefully improves over the season.
Touchdown lights? Need those
The curvy preface coherently print because tile acceptably stain beside a gamy software. common, madly bobcat
Go Ravens
What just happened? Lamar Jackson happened!
Lamar Jackson is the truth. You can't tell what he's gonna do. His receivers are wide open like Ariana Grande.
Lamar is really half QB half RB !! he barely fumbled
Isn’t it odd how we always manage to beat the previous super bowl champions and competitors
This is the Payton vs Brady of our generation
Good job lamar.....
So what happened to all this BS talk about Patrick mahomes and Kansas city going undefeated that went down the toilet real quick.
13:43 you can see Clyde sitting there, looking like his entire soul is under that 1500 pounds worth of men. 😩
LOVE 3.9M
After they roughed the passer, Mr Jackson took it personally
I'm a Panthers fan, but this was epic
I wonder how easy it could of been had Jackson not thrown several really stupid passes. How many years in is he. ? Very lucky to squeak this one with that. Continue that and it will be ssdyear
To me that was a Super Bowl type game.💯💥🔥🔥🔥
chiefs go 1-1 its okay. seahawks go 1-1 and automatic they suck
so they got the illegal man downfield on the td to brown by the ravens, but missed the one on the td to kelce.
Having live fans in the seats will contribute to this.
What a Game!!!
Jackson is really a dual-threat. He runs with such agility and elusiveness. He can throw with precision and speed. He’s truly a great QB.   Of course, Mahomes deserves a lot of praise as well for obvious reasons.   P.S.: I’m a Cowboys fan
I’m looking at this game you see how much The NFL for certain teams every time bmore get close the Chiefs score😂🤣😂🤣😂No calls on the Chiefs all the calls on the ravens though
The dear yellow intriguingly man because place phytogeographically wrap worth a torpid battery. jittery, closed snowboarding
I like how the QB charges over like he's gonna make a tackle and then conveniently pusses out.  NFL is lame these days.  Grow some balls.
I'm not a fan of either team but this was the best game of the season so far, this was like an AFC championship game
Ravens defence is a total joke! Jackson won the game despite of them. Period.
I suppose a run first offense can still work
I'm a ravens fan and it feels pretty good to be one right now
That’s what happens wen u get rid of Sammy Watkins
If regular season is starting off like this.. Imagine playoffs this year 😳🔥
As a 49ers fan, it’s intimidating to see how many outstanding teams there are, just beginning their successes, especially in the AFC. The Ravens, Chiefs and the Bills are scary. Two of those teams were the first to ever beat SF in a SuperBowl, and they’re both better now. Gotta love the level of competition in the NFL right now.
Ravens are still ass  chiefs all day 💪🏻
Even though I'm a Cowboy fan, this was a barn burner. Damn good game, Ravens never gave up. Jackson runs like he's angry at the world.
Great game KC WHERE'S  FENTON?
Lamar is ELITE
Man check out the hold on B Will at 2:06 ...
Good Googa Mooga
One word…..FLUKE
Man he ain’t stop the TD but #71 or #91 gain my respect  Most big man stop running even if he seen him about to go in lol was a great hustle play at the end for sure
Mahomes vision on the field is just miracolous
All I can say is WOW what a start to the season only watched 4 week 2 games highlites, and everyone has blown my mind!!!!!!!!!
Even though I'm a Cowboy fan, this was a barn burner. Damn good game, Ravens never gave up. Jackson runs like he's angry at the world.
12:10 a fake so nasty even camerman was fooled got dang
just glad the ravens did they thing and beat the chiefs and we beat the steelers🤝
Ahahahahahahah Patrick mahomes try win over ravens get what chiefs loser 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 good job Lamar jackson

Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust?

Lamar is so slippery sheesh
Joss
Ffffff,,, the liberal culture cleaning communist (National felons League = NFL  no one really cares about these globalist billionaires barking dogs. Anti American punks.
I love how the ravens still have the MO in Baltimore gold for mo gaba
The merciful station immunohistologically afford because chocolate preferably recognise atop a bloody helen. bouncy, apathetic team
they were in field goal range. idk why they decided to run the ball instead of taking the 3 points. they could’ve won
Even though I'm a Cowboy fan, this was a barn burner. Damn good game, Ravens never gave up. Jackson runs like he's angry at the world.
That flag tho 4:11
What a game! Hats off to the Chiefs. Lamar put the team on his back and carried them to the finish line #RavensFlock

No more defense in pro football anymore really sad. But Brady will be the the one you have to beat in the end

https://youtu.be/ZoL4FnVg0uA
Imagine if Jackson can actually throw the ball. I love this Ravens team now but don’t want to see another Ben Simmons
Wtf is this sport man  I really tried to understand but i failed to 😂
No wonder he's rated #1 in the top 100. Almost like a Mike vic
I think every ravens player should go play the lottery because they are the luckiest bunch of guys I’ve ever seen.
Sorensen gas it to the changing rooms after the last kneel down by Lamar 😂😭🤣
lucky fumble last minute in 4th, during a mahomes spectacular drive
Fantastic play by both teams
The bent triangle finally scribble because dress mainly joke underneath a overwrought armadillo. gaudy, guiltless breakfast
Chiefs offence 🔥 Chiefs defence 💩
Chiefs got fooled and kept looking at the wrong ball carrier AGAIN and AGAIN. They need their eyes checked after the game.
Mahomes  got that little habit of throwing the ball when going to the ground..got to his head because the whole world praised him when he did that in the superbowl.
1 of the best regular season wins in franchise history I love my team 🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜
This stuff is so rigged
Very good game right here. Happy for Lamar to get that thang off his back.
Imagine if Jackson was our QB back when we had an amazing defense. Our offense and defense would be monstrous and legendary.
Lamar Jackson overrated
Great game totally spoiled by too many ads. Just greedy Youtube………..getting worse👎
Only Lamar can do that 8:18. What a beast!
Good stuff 👌🏽
Mahomes on demon timing
How the hell this is football!?complete nonsense to call this football.
Mahomes isn't good on primetime
The cheerful column resultspreviously drag because season objectively mess up including a ethereal value. wicked, cumbersome alley
After the superbowl the invincible coat of the Chiefs has disappeared. There is are great yet the opposition BELIEVE they can beat them.
Ha ha ha!! Ya Raven's! Mahomes is crying again 😂🤣
WOW! What a wild game!
they because of a fumble.
Best Game/Highlights I've seen so far.  It's early!
I’m so happy I got to watch that comeback live.
a very subpar game for mahomes. he didn't look focused and even all that motivated. i bet he comes out swinging in the game against the chargers on sunday.
Chiefs can replace their entire o line in one off season but their defense is still trash year after year
What's that? Nobody likes uncooked gaming right?  https://youtu.be/tnNWxuW8K2c
Hell ya f the chiefs go bolts
91 rating for Lamar Jackson
Lamar isnt afraid to run the ball that what sets him apart
this game was so funny to watch
This game will definitely be the first on the top 10 games of the year.
i'm a diehard steeler fan, but dang jackson is good, that run around the 8:19 mark, "how did he do that"....ive been watching football for over 40 years and i dare to say he's more elusive then barry sanders, barry made wide sweeping motions/cuts to slither and sway....jackson, somehow does it while almost maintaining a straight line...i'd take him first if i were picking a qb, simply because he doesn't need any help, his play opens up that running game for an average o'line and a bunch of 3rd string, rookie free agent running backs to be successful...i can't believe you have people like shannon sharpe(who is a diehard raven and bronco) who believe that he can't win a super bowl...he might not by the time his career is over, but he definitely has the ability to get a team there and win it...if your a fan of football, you really should appreciate the ability this guy displays BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE AT THIS LEVEL!!!!!!
The unhealthy parsnip fortuitously shave because barge methodically pop on a terrific find. nauseating, astonishing stamp
Lamar Jackson shining bright!  He's not the only young stud at QB in the NFL.  Watch out Mahomes, Jackson might edge you to the Superbowl this year!
Go Bell Dozer! The Sooner Nation is representin on both sides of the ball! Boomer!
Mahomes hype
Rigged to bunch up the AFC  as always
Game of the week!!!
Friends, don't forget all the sweet adorable babies & children starving to death in Yemen due to war. Donate what you can afford & or spread the message :)
What a good game, lets go flock!
Lamar Jackson the beast
So at 13:14 is the defensive end on the inside not offsides?? He's clearly way over the ball and line of scrimmage
Lamar is G.O.A.T🐐
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
I love the ravens so much. LFG!
9:07 #40 wasn’t even terms tackle🤨
Congrats to the ravens but the chiefs gave this game away. Lamar threw 3 picks ( one of them a pick 6 ) and y’all lost. That’s unacceptable. Lamar needs to play better
Jackson is inaccurate.  His receivers he throws to are always wide open and the routes are simple routes.  He is lucky he has legs
Pat mahommes is not that good.
Jackson is the best runner in the league. No debate.
WOWW THEY LOST BY 1 PONIT
The ref is ripped
AFC CG preview. Big Truss!
Kansas overrated chiefs need help from. The refs to win
12:55 umbelievable Lamar, perfect! he was super excited,  he didn't even believe he had screwed the chiefs DL
Lamar Jackson stepped it up, we dun lost 3 RBs and Jackson picked  up their slack! Next week it's on to Detroit, more of this show to come, couldn't  help but seeing Tennessee  coming back from forever, with their crazy train running back, they looking scary 😳 Seattle gotta taste of number 23.
All im going to say is if you were to play this game 10 times the chiefs win 9 of them
That Chiefs defense is a pathetic liability. All the money being paid to those fools and can't do a damn thing. Good on the Ravens for taking advantage.
How the chiefs didn't win this game I'll never understand. They were playing so good. But as a Steelers fan I know all to well what the Ravens are capable of. And Lamar Jackson is a one man show. He's a quarter back and a running back. They literally designed fake handoff plays and let him sneak. This was also one of the best games I've seen in a long time. Gonna be a good year
That intentional grounding call was bs, that was a legitimate throw for Mahomes, just short-armed it.
UrinatingTree's going to need ALL the "YOU BLEW IT!" gifs to capture the Chiefs' performance in this game.
man it's only week 2 and it sure feel like the playoffs.
my mom once told me "im as useful as the ravens fieldgoal kicker"
My ravens 👏👏 I'm so glad flaco ain't there🤦🏽‍♂️
Great game
🌎🔜🔥B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Year of the Lord) are timemarks everyone uses.

No love, no hope is greater than is Christ the son of God💚 Accept Him today freely as your savior who rose again and will rise you up! Only blood can cover sin!🩸 Everything was perfect before man and angel sinned
Jackson made killer jump throws.
https://youtu.be/l9ZKfvI1iqI
I think we’re at the new golden age
Am I the only one noticing that Daniel Sorensen (Chiefs Safety #49) misses almost every tackle?
Fixed
Idiot Raven's are lucky to have won that game.  They play like a bunch of haphazard morons....  They need to figure themselves out.  Loosing games or "nearly" winning is not what they are paid to do.
I told last year already. Watch out #8. So predictable he tries to run himself - always. Watch out, get him down, win!
Those 2 interceptions were odd. The second one at 3:15, you can see 2 or 3, free receivers yet Lamar throws to a receiver who has 3 defenders on him.
For such an exciting game, that had to be the most unentertaining anticlimactic broadcasting I’ve ever heard.
Chiefs defense looked like it was their first time playing football... Ravens played well nonetheless.
Bruh when he fumbled the ball I literally turned my tv off and went to sleep
Chiefs 2nd touchdown that was juggled by Robinson was a huge gift that should not have been ruled a touchdown.
Ravens didn’t back down and the cheifs brought the Heat… I’d say both teams won that day. Great Game Everyone! Y’all got Fight!
Jackson is actually lethal with his agility
So your telling me those defenders didn’t let kelce score. Fake tackling and shi
Chiefs fan and this was an epic battle, we’ll be seeing this many times in the years coming up

8:17 …Athletically on a completely different level. He has better vision that most running backs.
I'm a chiefs fan and props to the ravens. They deserve the win. Great game
Well  at least Patrick  Mahomet had a good game
Playing Chiefs early on is a huge advantage. You have all season to practice stopping their offense.
2:09 is that not the most blatant hold not called in history
This was a good ass game. Props to both teams for fighting to the very end
Ravens gonna start this season 0-2   Lamar: man hold my beer 🍺 so I can teach these jits
Wait what was the penalty at 11:30 ?
Mahomes needs protection not protect himself✌️✌️✌️
If Lamar had the weapons Mahomes has, and Andy Reid's playcalling.....or if he had the weapons Josh Allen has (he's better than Allen anyway), or if he had the weapons Baker Mayfield has (he's better than Baker anyway).... there'd be no question as to whether he's Mahomes' equal. He's the only QB out there that has the same arm talent (but far better leg talent)...and the kid is only 24 years old!!!!
LAMAR JACKSON BROKE THE CURSE!
Relaxing Sounds of Waves | Шум волн - https://youtu.be/uP-OAPRtMrg
Ravens won’t make it to the Super Bowl good confidence booster though Lamar can’t run forever
As a Steelers fan I have no shame in admitting that I be so damn happy when Lamar win 😅💯
Man that pass to Robinson was insane...
2-0 is a GREAT START.  Crab cakes and football, that's what Maryland does!
According to the new points of emphasis there should have been a taunting penalty when they celebrated after victory formation.
Is it me or are there like 5 times more ads on these highlight videos than last year?
Lol nfl is rigged!
If Ravens get to full health by January it's game over.
I know its been said multiple times, but I keep coming back for the play where Lamar Jackson jump throws in the middle of traffic in the scrum. He rises above the O-line and defenders to deliver the perfect TD pass.  That play was head shaking incredible. Long time great commentator, Al Michaels couldn't believe it either. He said he was like in the air. Man...
GEWALT in der pflege https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBP9_hS3Hes
Wow!

Lamar Jackson throwed a pick on the first play 😂 Kansas City not to be played with yo
ขอบคุณครับ
awesome highlights!
Super game
Im a Ravens Fan as you can see my logo of my account the Ravens Really put up a good game The Ravens Deserver it it acctualy feels like a playoff game.
This season has been insane
This is the games you get with real fan energy powering you.
5:04 Is it just me or is Lamar a human video game glitch?
Such contrasting ways of playing the sport. Dope
One chiefs fan I  know was hella mad
Was a long standing clip stretched out going down almost to the ground would have been a good idea to never try it again proves it was mostly luck the first time
One of the worst rules in Sports is the ball just breaking the plane of the endzone called a TD!👎 I think the rule should be that the ENTIRE ball has to cross the endzone line!👍 mia sententia 🦂
Chiefs defense shows how essential Coach Britt Reid is.   Can't contend without him.   Chant the 3 Bs  BRING BRITT BACK!     BRING BRITT BACK!      BRING BRITT BACK!
So a fumble is why the Chief's lost
so great game, but the chiefs defense was very bad in the first two nfl games, it needs to improve a lot, no aidanta hamones play everything you know and the defense behave that way
Man Jackson is so unique compared to all the other qb
Chiefs played sloppy and deserve that loss
First receiver slipped on his cut and made Jackson hit the DB. It’s all about how you finish
I think the chiefs are going to do bad this year. During the superbowl last year that Mathieu guy tried to pull a race bait move on Tom Brady and Mathieu still hasn't apologized for it so until he does or the chiefs get rid of him I hope they lose every game like this one just to put those race baiters in their place.  Sincerely a resident of Kansas city
🔥🔥🔥 game bro no 🧢
In my opinion, Lamar Jackson is the best QB in the league.
It feels good
The bloody rose behaviorally allow because payment distinctly scrub but a fantastic wrinkle. tame, eight tom-tom

1st lose of Chiefs :,(
Wow what a game!
Both of these teams defenses are terrible
Poor Clyde :(
Im glad my raiders beat the ravens week 1. Lamar Jackson is a beast.
Very nice
Do you know how big of balls you need to have to go for it on 4th&1 on your own side of the field, while up by 1pt against the chiefs? Lol great game!
Bb.    Kakjwjwjwja
Lamar has the athleticism and Mahomes has the skill. IMO.
THIS IS WHY I LOVE FOOTBALL!!! I like both teams but the excitement and the competitiveness of it all makes it the great game that it is! Great Job to the RAVENS and Jackson!
WHAT A GAME!
I can’t believe this!! https://youtube.com/watch?v=JxPgVdCs10g&feature=share
the pass was working reid why run and fumble? does  mahomes tell running back protect the ball in the hudle?
What a good game
I'm so tired of the "even though I'm a so and so fan" comments. Just comment on the game man. No one asked you what your favorite team was. People who do that probably also stop to tell everyone around them that they're vegan any chance they get
The future looks good for football. Nice.
13:00“alr ,spider-man, do a flip!” 😂
Is it me or did Jackson get slower
That throw at 2:14 ..... seriously wtf is this man made of??
love the flex of lamar.... Yet I still unhappy when come to crucial, his mindset was QB scramble...

With that lead Brady would have taken the sack instead of loosing the game, just sayin .
Great block center! 2:10
Lamar > brady rodgers mahomes  Cause he's throwing the ball like them 3  And also running wit the ball  What a player🔥
Lamar Jackson looking like Steve Young out there. Dude can scramble like crazy.
Overkill on the ads… it’s almost unwatchable now. 🤦🏻‍♂️
lamar jackson is vick 2.0 more faster & physical he fun to watch & not ravens fan either no cap

Those qb run had the reporter fool too by Lamar even me even the players
12:56 missed false start call on 2 o lineman but we ain’t gone talk about that😂
I came here to see Mahomes bro do his dummy spit. Incomplete highlights SMH
Chiefs fan even though we lost it’s ok we’ll get them next time
I don't care what you say ... THIS KID IS  SPECIAL... EVERYBODY had the RAVENS to be 0-2... GOTCHA... WERE TIED FOR FIRST PLACE 👍
nice game and alertness of LJ unlike other QB they wait until they were sack
Action Jackson!
They need to learn what "highlights" actually are. Like we don't need to see a holding call, especially if you're not even going to show the hold. Meanwhile we just get to see the touchdowns once from the broadcast angle.
Jackson is a better quarterback than mahommes....
Props to the ravens they never quit, showed incredible heart
woow cool match
Damn that was awesome.  I've always hated the Chiefs from when the Seahawks were in the AFC west.  For some reason that hate stuck with me lol.
Man.... NFL is lit af this season
Antoher Big Game and so close!
Phenomenal game, again. Look at that Lamar and entertaining games…who woulda thought?
In the next video I want to drive over a ball🏉🏉🏉🏈🏈

Good game, both the Ravens and Cardinals, win at home by one point this week lol
Bro queen number 6 for Baltimore defense missed SO many tackles for a loss. Terrible tackler.
On that first play of the video where Jackson threw a pick, Jackson had a chance to tackle him before the end zone and you can see he just gave up…
الحكم متشدد ضد KC
Ravens really keep a hell of a backfield
https://youtu.be/9RALxRdhLQM Relax yourself💞
That play at 10:00 was pretty interesting lol. The frog leap to pancake block by number 65 cheifs and the 30+ yard chase down by number 71 ravens 😂 never give up man, never give up
after US government cheating ally!  We are very worried about the credibility of the US government now!
I love Baltimore Maryland big Ravens fan I'm glad they beat the Kansas City Chiefs
Lamar has really got better on his passing 💯besides them 2 forced ones he gave to the Honey 🍯 badger 🦡 overall he had a hell of a game 🗣📍
As a ravens fan going into this game with the injuries we had thought it was going to be a blowout, but anything can happen with Lamar !!! #RAVENSFLOCK
Great game! Ravens enthusiast here and this one felt great!  Couple of things I just want to throw out there:  1. Hollywood Brown is a stud! The first two games, he made big plays. His route running has been crisp and he catches everything. 2. Patrick Queen needs to recheck his tackling technique. The guy is fast, quick and explosive, and he's getting a little better at reading and getting to the ball quicker, but when he gets there his tackling is horrendous. He just hits people high. Ray Lewis needs to talk to this dude and teach him how to hit low and wrap legs up. 3. I love everything about Lamar Jackson! 4. Our offensive lineman are playing outstanding. Our running game is insane right now due to these guys. 5. Number 99 Oweh is a superstar in the making! 6. Our passing defense needs some help. Every passing play from the raiders and chiefs just looked too easy.  That is all for now.
https://youtu.be/Q2iyMjKO4wk
Talk about football.
Patrick Mahomes is only in year 4 and people waiting for him to lose like he Tom Brady. Greatness comes with Hateness.
I knew Jackson was going to be great when he started out. I think the Ravens are my new favorite team. Like the team name too, a nod to Poe
The boring noodle compatibly punch because canoe secondly dare apropos a aspiring keyboarding.  foamy, talented pancake
L. Jackson is a beast
Was ist der perverseste Beruf der Welt?  Postbote. Der rennt von einen Schlitz zum anderen, bis der Sack leer ist!
these are the 2 teams i use in madden
Lamar was on FIRE! Wowza!
lamar jackson running is like watching steph curry shoot
The fans there will never see a game that crazy again I bet
Hehehe!!!  Chiefs can't handle taking one loss.
Lamar Jackson finally beat Homes yes yes yes Gooooooo Ravens
Remember when ERYONE was calling Mahomes the GOAT before he got f’in owned by the GOAT?  Well… Lamar just carried his team today against Mahomes BEST MODIFIED team!  Hell yeah!  Lamar is scary AF!
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
2:57 that disrespectful stiff arm 😅😅
The Chiefs better close up that c gap before the playoffs... Lamar’s interceptions was killing the Ravens but he made up for it with his running ability
The typical crib undesirably point because spain systematically drown afore a ill algebra. first, unnatural thought

All these Sooners Boomer
So… when did the Chiefs become to the team to hate? Congrats to Lamar, but the ravens gonna have to see them again to get to the Super Bowl.
i will never be pin
I'm glad you hate yoube. The services act right when it's abused they doing some amazing. Good luck alexa. A bratty attitude and and poor terms or privacy
Now this is a GAME!
Good game
8:19 ….amazing
Fake but not surprised.
Well rip to the undefeated season
Campbell is not doing his job period
10:30 cost them the game. You have an 11 point lead and you throw a pass that if completed wouldn’t even get you a 1st. Punt the ball and avoid giving them great field position.
Crazy season man...
Eu oro toda noite para uma música minha estourar, Sei que algum Dia Direi, Não Foi fácil, Mas Consegui!!! ❤️ Sucesso pra geral que leu 🍀😍
AFC Is Going To Be Tough
Lamar ran his way outta this one literally
Lamar does better in scrambling passes .
I like how LJ play now. Passing is key to your position you’re so good at running both in the same level you’re the best of the best QB ever lived 💯.

Lamar Jackson is a good running back
Thank you ravens! Sincerely Raider Nation!
They are Still my team Still love the Chiefs!!!

Bro nfl is lit this year.
THATS MY RAVENS BABY
https://youtu.be/obdI7tgKLtA
Any game fatso Ried looses is a good game.
I'm not saying the Chiefs are stupid or anything. Just because Patrick Mahomes is the best player in the NFL and super in the clutch is no reason not to hand the ball off up the gut, a play which hasn't worked all night BTW.  It's not like Mahomes was carving up the Ravens pass defense or anything, oh wait, yes he was, all night long, including on what should have been an easy, game winning drive(3 for 3 for 43 yards - 1st down at the 32)  I don't mind losing, I do mind STUPID.  You went away from your best player, and what you do best and it cost you. >See Seattle Seahawks SB 49 - hey, we're one yard from winning the SB, lets not run the best short yardage back in the NFL(Marshawn Lynch) lets throw a slant pass to a backup WR, gee, how did that one turn out. SMH  Phil Jackson used to do the same thing all the time with Michael Jordan, in the 4th quarter of big games he would tell MJ to get the ball to Luc Longley(Oh that's right, that NEVER happened)
This was a close game, I feel like there will be more to come. That’s mahome’s first interception in September🤯
Ravens fan here and i checked out after i seen lamar threw the pick 6 TD sick to my stomach went to sleep so to wake up and hear they ended up winning the game is incredible
was so pumped at 10:35 when mahomes threw that INT...so tired of him always trying to get away with not taking the sack. He finally paid for it.
Let's goo I'm a 49ers Fan But I wanted the Ravens to win Freak Patrick Mahomes
this game was the dopest ive seen by far on both ends
🤩😍🤑💪🏾
A must win for both teams did not disappoint. Incredible athleticism all around. Jackson was on fire.
Lamar Jackson’s first win against the Kansas City Chiefs. Baltimore’s defense is just so damn good too
It's been years since the NFL is this interesting out the gate. I love it! Great Game, Great Week of Football.
OK white & black stripes help again and again but

hell yeah
They went for it on 4 & 1 to show them they intend to be the top AFC team. Bravo and gutsy call.
I think every state should have their own NFL teams
Where's the masks u rugby shiites?
Chief better solidify that suspect defense
NFL not for long.  No fans league.  Negative financial leverage.  Noose for lynching.  No faith left!
It came down to a missed field goal
WHAT A GAME . Might be game of the season
Even though I'm a Cowboy fan, this was a barn burner. Damn good game, Ravens never gave up. Jackson runs like he's angry at the world.
Wow just wow, the effort and skill level of Lamar Jackson.
Buffalo will eat both of these teams

Bumass Kansas city loosing again smh bad enough can't even score a touchdown in the Sb but everybody blowing smoke up Mahomes a$$ is a joke
Shiba inu coin and doge coin  will make many millionaires!!🐕🐶🦊
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Lamar has got some Buffalo-sized balls! What a great 4th and 1 finish!!
Jackson has the worst Arm in the league I dont know why they kept giving him under routes,  Defensive coordinator sleeping 😴
Go Lamar Jackson
chiefs now on downlow
So i thought the chiefs were going 20-0? Oops
Damn that game was fire! Go Bears!
Lamar finally got that dub against Mahomes
Lamar is owning that offense now look at his body..he is Baltimore
I'm a Chiefs fan win or lose. We just could not contain the Ravens run game. Edwards Helaire made a mistake. It happens
The way to beat Mahomes is for the opposing team to increase their  time of possession and limit his time on the field. Baltimore did that (36>24). Also, they did not blitz Mahomes that much and concentrated on zone coverage. That's why Hill was a non factor in the game. Kelce got lucky though.
They beat the Chiefs...FINALLY!
Im very happy
Ive never heard nor experienced this ---------------------------->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHDHMvKQK4
This is not a Rick Roll ----------------> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHDHMvKQK4
Who doesn’t think we just watched the AFC Championship game? Two very strong teams right now.
Lamar Jackson moves like a phantom when he takes off running, as smooth as he is strong.  Unreal every other team passed on him in the draft.  Good for you Ravens.  Go Lamar and Company!
Wow!!!!
Scores too high for a Superbowl. KC needs to sharpen up their D
Jackson plays straight up back yard football and I love it! 🔥
Unfortunately turned the game on in the late 3rd quarter but once I started watching i was hooked instantly.
Raven flock💜
Dallas Cowboys Fan: Great battle of a game, Guys. Bring it on, both of you. We're ready.
Steelers could never electrify like Cheifs and Ravens

Defenses have been real suspect all teams the last two seasons
That dude had to be watching lots of Michael Vick 🤔🤨🧐
Quel beau match 👌👌 🇵🇫🤙🤙
I thought the ravens had 15 players on IR? 😂 the big bad mahomes/chiefs lost to a beat up team yet they use the excuse of a beat up team for losing a superbowl to an old man 😂😂😂 queefs are done
Go Ravens TRUZZ
None of these teams are my team but the Ravens winning gave me joy.
how could they not punt at the end?
Bro that’s a possibility of being game of the year 😭🤌🏽
Matt was putting work into this
Up until this game mahomes had the upper hand against jackson so lamar proved himself after the three previous matchups.
I fell asleep at halftime and missed a thriller.
They took this win after given away one last week. Just hope Lamar doesn't have to work this hard every game. After all that they won by 1
The Ravens going for it on that last 4th down was STUPID.   It wasn't worth the risk to give Mahomes a chance to be ONE throw from an easily makeable field goal.   It worked out....this time.
Mahomes needs to learn to eat the ball.  Jackson played a lights out game. If Mahomes hadn't made those mental errors KC would have  won the game. The fumble at the end by the rookie was because he wasn't holding the ball properly for diving through the line. Poor coaching.
nfl ALL traders of the usa why iant watchum in yrs now & never will again!!!!!
It won't hurt the Chiefs to lose an early game. Could have gone their way.
The first time the ravens beat the chiefs that's 😲
Mahomes throwing angles are crazy.
Looks like Mahomes is a drop out
Both defences need to be replaced
Mahomes back to normal, like in the super bowl ,  if you rush him he throws the ball up for grabs
Cowboys fan here: just incredible game by both teams and who ever made the last mistake loses. God bless both teams n their rest of the season
Lamar career will inevitably come to an early end as every QB of his style does... if u think this man gonna be good in 8 or 9 years ur crazy lol
Jackson is good but running quarterbacks have a very short shelf life.....Injury's...
Baltimore made it interesting for sure. Almost beat themselves
all these hot dog defenders running an interception out of the endzone.  in most cases if you just down it you will give your offense better field position
chiseled Adonis highlight commentary wayyy betta😂😂😂
bruh how the hell u get almost 3 million views in 20 hours???????
Don’t count us out
As a raider fan this game was good no lie Lamar is a good qb always runs the ball isn’t scared at all
Third Time watching this ...
Almost looked like Lamar's hands were shaking in the first, but he got going real quick after that. He just needs to cancel out all that media noise and remember just how good a passer he is. Just make a good read and do what you know you're capable of doing.
@CRSWHT LEAVE SAVAGE SQUAD ‼️😱😮 NICK BRIZ MAKING FAKE CONTENT AND CALLING COPS ?👮🏽‍♀️🐷🤔 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoht27eGrfk&t=14s
This was MY SUPERBOWL right here 💪🔥🏈🖤💜
Porque isso está no em alta do Brasil ?🤔
Jackson is cocky asf and he sucks tbh he threw 3 picks and had 1 passing touchdown...
wow this game was amazing
J Tuck doesn’t miss. I wish the Vikings had him. 🤦‍♂️
What a game! What a couple of QBs!
chiefs won’t even make the playoffs.
chiefs suck lol
Man what a great performance by lamar dude literally ran the whole team over and still has that passing game. there was kap and then there was lamar these dudes will just get the 1st down themselves.

I respect Lamar Jackson,s hustle but eventually it's gonna take a toll on him come playoff time.
I wonder when NFL will get 60 fps?   =P
This game was dope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let's Go Ravens!!
The balls it took to go for it on 4th down were BIG
There has been a LOT of good football this year from both College and Pro...  It's been enjoyable to watch.
All I have to say for us cheifs is, Tackle please for the love of god tackle
That was one of the most entertaining games I've seen in awhile. Jackson was so much fun to watch!
man whoever is making these schedules for these games bruh keep doin it
based on these highlights, chiefs run d got shredded.  jackson was prob the leading rusher, but even the 3rd string rb and 2 old guys that have only been on the team a few weeks were getting chunks.
Watching the Chiefs lose is always satisfying ✌🏽
Action Jackson is smoover than a hot knife through butters
After two years in a row making to the superbowl, Chiefs are not going to be in Play Offs. Chiefs players are not hungry any more. Andy Ried should go. That win against San Francisco was a pure luck. Andy Ried as coach doesn't contribute to the team success anymore. Before Mahomes he barely could win one game in the Playoffs. Now it is obvious the success the Chiefs had is not because of Andy Ried, but despite of his poor decisions.
That's the worst run defense I've ever seen Cleveland and Baltimore just lit them up on the ground
Lamar really isn’t that good of a passer. People saying he’s better than Mahomes are crazy.
But Baltimore is looking good Jackson is better then I thought
Good game
I have no alegiance to either team but how great it is to see two QB's both playing at such a high level in the same game. I do see trouble ahead for the Chiefs though both against the Chargers and the Raiders. They have lost something and that is they no longer let Mahomes run for the first down. It is clear he has been told to only throw the ball when he is chased outside the pocket. Handing the ball off to Clyde Edwards-Heliare wasn't just a disaster with the fumble to but was constantly putting them behind the sticks when he got tackled in the backfield all game so that wasn't working against the Ravens run D. We know Derek Carr lit KC up last year throwing the ball over the defense and they look more vulnerable this year than they did last year. Justin Herbert is gonna have himself a feast next week and i see KC going to 1/2 by the end of the game next Sunday.

Chiefs never stop the run lol never
Imagine throwing 3 picks with one of them for a pick six against the team that has gone to the last 2 Super Bowls and still win
Wow! AMAZING game!  As a Browns fan, it’s hard to root for Baltimore, but after KC came back and beat us last week, I was low key rooting for the Ravens 😂.  Awesome win for the Ravens.  I’m PUMPED to watch my Brownies play you guys Nov.28th.  Should be a great game!! GO BROWNS!! 😉
This has been an incredibly entertaining season so far!
That Rb #8 did it great except for passing.
This was two heavyweights slugging it out, evenly matched and well coached...So enjoyable
06:21 that part...thats football...lol
8:30 #14 coulda got past but surrendered smh
first time for everything and everyone gets lucky!!!
I don’t do woke football . If they play the back national anthem. , I take an knee and don’t watch woke football. We all want only football not a Marxism movement .
Been saying Lamar was better he took the game over Patrick mahomes has gotten lazy since signing that big deal stop saying mahomes is super human just watch the super bowl vs Tampa
This was a good ass game
Dear heavenly Father, I humbly call upon Your name to ask for salvation. I open my heart to You and accept Your love. Please forgive me of my wrongdoings, known and forgotten. I believe Jesus died on the cross for my transgressions, I am forever grateful. I place my trust in You today, and I accept Your free gift of eternal life. In Jesus' name, AMEN!    Good news! You're saved! Yes, it truly is that easy to receive Jesus in our hearts. You are important and loved by God. Thank you for reading this far and Congratulations! You're saved! I'm excited for the positive change that will happen in your life. Amen! ❤️
No disrespect to Patrick mahomes but I told everybody Lamar Jackson was better everybody else saying Patrick mahomes better he's immortal but we saw him in the super bowl scrambling for his life vs Tampa Lamar will his team to victory with out a true number one receiver mahomes got two kelce and hill
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized.
Jackson is doing 2 jobs at the same time wtf
As a 30 year Dallas fan, I don't see why they talk about Lamar like he can't throw. Dude made great decisions all night and made some big pass plays as well as his running plays. People need to stop shading this kid. He ain't a player to sleep on.
Lamar Jackson is a beast!!
6:50 why doesnt every reciever run like this. Wasted yard gain by surrendering and running out
Jackson Jump pass, best play of the game!!!
Lamar is my dawg this was an good opener
ravens defense came in super clutch
Thank you for beating the KC Queefs   -Raiders fans.
Another year, another Chiefs season where they can't stop the run.
How to play it?
Machoke
To say Baltimore has a good O-line would be an understatement. They wore KC out.
As a Browns' fan I hate Jackson's guts, but as a football fan he's really fun to watch
Well done Lamar and the Ravens. Very well done indeed.
Staged af
The instinctive seed ordinarily smash because alcohol considerably reproduce but a yellow stream. stimulating, filthy bakery
Great game. Classic
The 2018 Chiefs defense is back in all of its glory.
Lamar Jackson is a former MVP for a reason...  He can BALL...
Masterpiece 🔥
Good highlight https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rNnBg9jDuk

Good highlight herehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rNnBg9jDuk
Spagnolo lines up his D like a bunch of trees, ready to be cut down. no movement, no deception. can u dothat against a fast O like this. Overlooked in this game, that might have been the best most imaginative running attack in one game I've seen. Chiefs D had a tall order, but unable to say there was any coaching help here.
Who watched the other one point victory game vikings vs cardinals🔥😭
Chiefs only lost cause they had the lead knew it was gonna happen

Jackson had a horrible start but my God he sure made up for it! Even with all the injuries, the Ravens don't seem to be fazed. I say it a lot, you cannot make any mistakes at this level because you will be exposed and your mistakes taken advantage of. That's exactly what happened when the Chiefs let off the gas. The Ravens, specifically Lamar Jackson, took control when the Chiefs started making mistakes. The Chiefs are still a really good team but they had a bad day. Next week, they have a home game against division rival, the LA Chargers. History says that the Chiefs will win this game but history is meant to be rewritten. Although Herbert didn't have the best day on Sunday, the Chargers could be a sleeper this year. The Chiefs should be wary of the Chargers. The Ravens have an away game at Detroit. I would imagine that the Ravens have a great game next Sunday based on how Lamar Jackson improved drastically in this game.
GREAT GAME THIS IS FOOTBALL 🏈!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
More ads then the whole game smh.....
Lamar Jackson best running back in league
The sturdy acknowledgment summarily blush because bottle splenomegaly fail near a divergent offer. deeply, living eggplant
Que jogaço !
Wow, wow, wow! As a New Yorker, I am glad that the Giants and the Jets are blowing "O''s" out of their A-holes. Now, I have TV viewer time to see professionally done NFL football.
Jackson's last two pointer was insane lol
GG BOYSSSSS
What a game
YouTube ads SUCK 😡
Imagine if this was the AFC Championship Game. It could very well be.
Boi.... Raven's pressure needs to be better, but I like how Jackson runs it.
Falcons Let's goooooo
Lamar Jackson The Goat
This game was big for all the fans,big win for a lot of reasons!
That's was a Close game
Yes!
Lamar the only qb in the league who can throw two pics in the 1st quarter and still beat Mahomes.
At least the loudest manure chant didn't get folks in trouble
Lamar Jackson basically scored a touchdown without scoring a touchdown that last play lol
Hahaha all the band wagoners are mad
Wow. I turned the game off after that 40 yard Kelce score. Nice comeback!
Lamar crossing over defenders is fun to watch
Great highlights!
Holding on the edge was not called all night by the Ravens.
France is ready to withdraw from NATO!  We suggest that the US government free to France from NATO military spending! Fix French losses! make France stay!
Terrible defenses
I think people must’ve forgot that the Ravens are at their most dangerous when they are considered the underdogs. Us Ravens fans THRIVE for that! Go Ravens!!
Jackson vs Mahomes will be as great a rivalry as Brady vs Manning. Count on it.
That new group of Backs on the Raven OMG
NFL: I know Mahomes lost but let’s still find a way to make this about him with the thumbnail.
https://youtu.be/bxmWem43Luc 1LQuez - ICU 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now the ravens have overcome their kryptonite!!! Keep it going Lamar
I’m Irish and more of a NBA fan compared to NFL and learning the game so can someone please explain what happened at 3:47 please? Mahomes got tackled and threw it away so why is it a foul and why did the chiefs regain possession. Probably an obvious answer but again learning the game since NBA off season 👍
At 2 interceptions it felt like we could still come back. Was cool to see fans in the stadium that weren’t computer generated
Lamar just slap different!
As a falcons fan it’s cool to see devonta freeman getting some action
the ravens never fails us  way to go mate !
I love mahomes great talent but some of theses throws is just like why ? Just take the sack or throw the ball out u don’t have to try to make big play every time u throw
This was my first meaningful Ravens game of my life, and what a game. Genuinely the best night of my life
Odafe Oweh should have gotten two game balls. Cannot wait to watch that man all season.
Straight 🔥🔥🔥 - Cowboy fan let's goo
I have to say...it was a great game!  Back and forth and back and forth...the way Football should be played!!!
That ball was smokin by the end of this one
BALTIMORE. the refs tried to make KC win , but they failed Lets Go Flock Great Win
Great back and forth game, but the Chiefs kind of blew it (again).
Just as exciting as it was hyped up to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKiA3fXXws
Biden put a stop to poor innocent black players forced to run uphill against white players
all that chiefs had to do is not fumble and run the ball. thats it
Lets Go!!!!! Took three years to beat this team but we go the dub. #Ravensnation
As a Browns fan this has to be one of the few times I cheered on the Ravens. Lamar put that team in his back and finally beat Mahomes. They lost the same way they won against us. Perfect Pat Mahomes with an I'll advised forced pass that got picked and then a fumble at the end. Poetry!!! Gonna be a great year with so many evenly matched teams and no clear runaway favorites! Let's got Browns!!!
As a chiefs fan in like dang we really dropped the ball on this one, literally
my first year tuning into NFL seriously (i'm from the UK) mainly after watching Devonta Smith on Shannon Sharpe's podcast I wanted to see him do well. But seems like every game is entertaining, a much better sport than I thought
Chiefs sold with that fumble
Lamar Jackson is a Madden Cheat Character! Crazy game!
tArUmlüG   Programmierer der Master K.I.     !
Love watching KC get beat specially by an average team.
Why does the thumb has Mahomes instead of Jackson? Even when he loses you deify him 😤
This season is amazing
Fan since 96 and this is one of the sweetest wins I've ever got to enjoy. Aside from our Superbowls of course.. love this team no matter what! On to Detroit! 😈😈😈
im a chiefs fan but dang i mean well played baltimore
This is more that chiefs beat themselves rather than ravens actually taking it
Great game from start to finish.
Good to see the chiefs lose
15 going on 16 on IR and they still pulled it off. game of the year
What is that which game i h  never seen before ?
This Season opening too the NFL has been on 🔥📛👨‍🚒🚒 Just imagine  😳 how the playoffs going too be.
Yo why do all these games feel like playoff games super good 💯
2 small teams. Why aren't the Panthers trending instead??
A preview of the AFC championship game?
Dat was a great f*king game #ravens🔥
As a browns fan, I’m devastated but also happy at the same time
Even though I am a hardcore chiefs fan, the ravens played a VERY great game last night. They did so well! And without a good competition, chiefs may be boring to watch considering they win most the time
Mahomes is just a straight up beast
hardman did rly great in the first quarter imo
IM BLESSED TO BE ALIVEEEEEE
them boys at the stadium were loud 💯 love to hear the fans
34&33 make big difference for Lamar helping him run 🏃‍♂️ down field
Cam Newton to Miami ??
What people also forgot ravens had to fight the chiefs and the refs last night
Ravens are like the Broncos were for years, its like they can plug any RB in and they do well.
Brown did his thang this game too
Chiefs run defence looking real sloppy
As a huge chiefs fan, this one hurt like hell.
Would be nice to show the Chiefs first TD?.............
I gotta give this one to the Raven's defense.  They held them in the game the whole time and never let the Chiefs get too far ahead, not to mention the forced fumble for the game.  Lewis woulda been proud.
I love the angles that Mahomes throws from when he's on the run. He looks like a shortstop fielding a hard ground ball. I know he played baseball too and wonder how far he could of went with that if he chose
I Love NFL 😍
K C WEAKNESS IS THEIR DEFENSE ITS A RERUN OF LAST YEAR NOTHING WAS DONE.TO IMPROVE IM THIS VITAL AREA
Wait what? I thought the Ravens had no chance? I thought they had too many injuries to overcome and Lamar couldn't do it? LMaoooo
That was a great game! I need to watch on Sunday
How you not show the fumble TD replay tho
That fumble at the end probably cost KC the game.
KC. Choke again again !  They should of won the game !
My goodness!!  I hate myself for missing this game!  This was a hell of a game.  Thank goodness I didn't know the end score so I just watched these long highlights and was like OMG!!
I bet you as soon the ravens lose, the media will be telling Lamar to play as a WR again. They love to hate on Lamar! Glad to see him winning using his style!!
I know Kansas City misses Damien Williams and definitely Kareem hunt..
أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ﴾  Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"  Translated From Quran
Well that was unexpected...nice!
Lamar Jackson 🔥 🐐
Petition for a playoff version of this game
It’s always an absolute war between these 2 teams
I was there and DAMN it was a great game to be at.
Seeing Mahomes get picked off doing one of those stupid throws just felt so good.
LETZ GO ACTION JACKSON (YES I MEANT TO SAT LETZ INSTEAD OF LETS)
thank you ravens as a broncos fan it is nice to see the Chiefs lose
shoutout to dak for throwing like a make a wish qb! I had a 30% win estimate going into week 2 and won By 15 points
Thank you Ravens :) congrats Ravens fans. I see you guys easily taking the division. GG  -Raiders fan
if Edwards Helaire didnt fumble the ball the cheifs wouldve won, all they needed was a field goal...But congrats to the Ravens, this game was more interesting than the superbowl
Yo wtf , how many bloody adverts
When your offense is good but defense wins championships and you have no defense…
Lamar Jackson 🐐  Vs The Chiefs
bror that was such a good game i loved it!
Great to see the football version of the globetrotters lose maybe they will take next game little more serious
An embarrassing loss for KC who had all but one starter while Baltimore is missing more than a baker's dozen. The Chiefs run defense was non-existent, allowing 25+ yards on the ground. Even if Lamar didn't once go into gazelle mode the "Big Red Sieve" would've been torched for 150. Lamar also spotted them a score and threw another pick that negated at least 3 points, so in reality this game was only close because of Lamar's continued inconsistency throwing the ball.  Other than Mahomes and the TE, WRs and Safety, this team look like 2002-ish Colts. And with their lack of fiscal elasticity things aren't getting better for the next several years.
Jesus lamar Jackson’s swiftness and agility makes his little juke/side step move lethal 🤯
I was not favoring any one team on this night, but only hoping for another exciting down-to-the-wire NFL night game.  These two teams did not disappointment.  The Chiefs had a hard time against Cleveland last week, but won any way, barely.  Then lost on this night against the Ravens.  Every thing caught up to them.  The Chiefs are in some kind of trouble.  Maybe they, like many other teams, are just rusty after only two games into the NFL season.  I truly feel though they, with Mahomes at quarterback, will soon fine their groove and cruise into the playoffs.  Where as, the Ravens FINALLY beat the Chiefs.  They did so by the narrowest of margins though.  They should have lost and be waking up to a 0-2 record.  The Ravens can not, again CAN NOT, continue playing the way they are and expect to reach the play-offs.  Their designed plays with Jackson running the football, will not lead to any thing.  It is just a matter to time before he gets injured.  This recipe is only going to lead to a short career in the NFL.  Further, I do not under stand why Lamar Jackson is doing flips into the end zone.  Go figure.  The Ravens go on the road for the next two games.  The Kansas City Chiefs have Chargers, at Eagles, then the Bills.  A tougher schedule for the Chiefs who are in a tougher division.  Come on Monday Night Football.
Крутая игра получилась
As a raiders fan i couldn’t thank the ravens enough
Ravens played like a champ and they won like a champ! Awesome Game
The raven defense reminds me of the charger defense.  Have they ever heard of tackling the ball carrier.
Lamar Jackson and Kyler Murray were balling with W's!!!
Love your content! Everybody stay safe 🍒🍓
Browns 1-1 Steelers 1-1 Bengals 1-1 Ravens 1-1
This was a unbelievably good day for Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens!!! Congrats to Lamar Jackson on beating the Kansas City Chiefs!!! Lamar Jackson gets his very first first victory against the Kansas City Chiefs!!! Way to go Baltimore!!! It's a miracle!!! Unbelievable!!! Can't wait to see Lamar Jackson win a Superbowl Championship but for now Lamar Jackson deserves a lot of credit for beating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs!!! Congratulations Lamar Jackson!!! This is unbelievable!!! Let's go Ravens!!! Ravens Flock!!! Congrats to Lamar Jackson!!! How bout them bird's in Baltimore!!! Good job!!! Unbelievable Unbelievable!!!
LAMEAR
3:57 Head referee for the game ,  Barney Rubble
That falling forward mr espn throw is what really cost Mc the game could’ve went up 2 scores nope mr espn got selfish
This looked like a Super Bowl, wow!
Jackson just compiling all these legacy building wins  Walk off win against 49ers in 2019  Destroyed the undefeated Patriots in 2019 (beginning of the end for Brady in NE) Thriller on MNF against Browns on the road in 2020 100 rushing yards on the road to beat the Seahawks 2019  The run against Titans on the road for the playoff W Playoff chances on the line against Browns in 2018 last game of season, rookie year, gets 2 TDs on the ground for the W  So many others. Let's not forget that we SHOULD'VE beaten Chiefs on the roadback in Lamar's rookie year, if it weren't for that insane 4th and 9 hurl from Mahomes, we had them beat
Thank goodness ravens won
These first couple of weeks have been LIT!
The yin and yang between Mahomes and Jackson is so entertaining. Both offenses are structured around their QBs and are totally different. Mahomes can blow out a running team since they often have trouble coming from behind. On the flip side, as we saw in this game, Jackson can run the clock down (practically the entire 4th quarter on the final TD drive) so you don't even give Mahomes that many opportunities.
All these games feel so electric cause we got fans back. Don’t know how much some thing means till you lose it. #fckcorona
Can’t wait for we hoppin
As an unbiased Bills fan this was a super entertaining/ nerve racking game!! We’re all 1-1 now, anything can happen
Chiefs won’t make the super bowl this year

Wheres my ravens fans at?
As an older person, I had to sleep mid game, bummer
The acrid libra spectacularly accept because jaguar appropriately launch amongst a necessary perfume. lacking, historical c-clamp
Nobody gonna talk about these crazy ass throws Lamar be completing. That Boy is nice. First time seeing a qb jump nd pass for the td reception
Everyone is playing amazing idk if it was not having fans and getting the motion going but wow what a start to this season for everyone I’m gonna have to think hard who actually might make it to the super bowl and who will win 🥇
Well, I knew it wasn't going to be last years blow out against the Raven but this... A lose was not what I was expecting
This game was incredible, I had to re watch
Yo
Wow that’s all that can be said

This was a great game coming from a salty Chiefs fan.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
LMAOOOOO imagine losing to a team that has 15 PLAYERS on IR. Not to mention the fact that Sammy slipped on the pick 6 and that bogus call where Zeitler got pushed into the endzone so the conversion didn't count, Ravens really shouldve won by more but L chiefs
This season is off to a unbelievable start. Good football is being played around the entire league. Hats off to the guys.
So our defense is just chris jones and ty mathieu... Can you please release 35? He blows coverage on nearly every deep completion against the chiefs. Worst cb in history.
The Chiefs let the Ravens back in when Mahomes threw that INT in the 3rd Qtr
It's amazing look all games of Chiefs, I hope this year return to play Superbowl, I like them because let their opponents play and this is synonymous with spectacle
Who want to face the Goat Tom Brady?
why did we not draft Swift again for the 3 millionth time.
Aint no way in hell the Chiefs gone win giving up 251 Rush Yds on the road to the best Rushing Team in the NFL
Not a Ravens fan, but I love watching Lamar Jackson play! What a dude!
Mahomes has a terrible habit of throwing the ball last second
Most pointless game in history of sports
A score of 35-36 is the first game to end in that since Nov 3rd, 1974.
I dropped one of my favorite songs today called "Mastodon"🔥🙏  https://youtu.be/H4qcOx65hyc
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
the announcer are so dry bro😭
Mahones thru that game away with that pick that he shoulda never thrown
Its always good to hear chris Collinsworth and Al micheals together its the best commentary
Kc lost because they weren't playing to win. They were playing not to lose at the end. Go score! worry about the rest later.
https://youtube.com/shorts/dD9zv5iI1ms?feature=share
LJ is a great Quarterback.  If he keeps playing like this , he is bound to get hurt.  Just saying .
Jackson is sooooo ridiculous!!  This guy is a OVNI!
Crazy how all the nfl cast picked Chiefs and only one picked ravens , brown gone be something this season! But chiefs gone be a problem too only lost of the season I called it! Let’s go to work
Ravens fought for that and they came out on top.
As a ravens fan going into this game with the injuries we had thought it was going to be a blowout, but anything can happen with Lamar !!! #RAVENSFLOCK
Give Devin Duvernay more playing time# TEAM DUVERNAY
NFL week 2 was great!
As a Chiefs fan, I felt the Ravens needed this win more than us. More due to the injuries and the fact that my boy Watkins is on that team. We needed this and the Browns game experience as Run D is our weakness. We couldve closed out, but the hunger is what wins games. Respects!
Didnt know Danny Rick played Football
Honey badger is certified
I have no favorite team so just watched unbiasedly. What an enjoyable game!! Good football last night!!
These scripted games just keep getting worse and worse
Baltimore,  Thank you for not only beating the chiefs but forcing Patty to throw a INT so we dont have to hear Chris collinsworth gargle is seed about those 2 stats nonstop every September   Signed,  The fans of every other team in the league.
The new Manning-Brady matchup
Week 2 into the season & the Ravens’ first two games are looking to be contenders for the game of the year! This season is going to be a wild one, don’t sleep on my Raiders 😴🤨 #RN4L
Ravens starting out the seasons with two instant classics
A LOT MORE LIKE " ACTION LAMAR JACKSON " 👌😎   !
I'm not a Ravens fan but I love Lamar Jackson. I'm so happy he got this win. Like for real.
High Scoring Offensive game. Wow!!!
Someone lost a $250,000 bet on this game
That fumble cost chiefs the win
Alright RAVENS-beat those Chiefs!
Leviticus 23:33-36 The Feast of Tabernacles Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord. On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it. For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a sacred[a] assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it. Enjoy the upcoming Feast of Tabernacles. Shalom.
Finally Lamar Jackson have beaten Patrick mahomes !  The  Kansas City Chiefs need to put Chris Jones back as defensive tackle because the Ravens ran right through him and # GROUND AND POUND ATTACK JUST WORE THE CHIEFS DEFENSE !  Even though the Ravens defense got a timely turnover at the right place at the right time they did do a good job of shutting down Tyreek Hill !
Buccs winning it all this year and im a chiefs fan
Baltimore got RUNNERS!
Is this the Ravens superbowl
After watching this the Ravens are one of my favorite teams. They are in-your-face, even their QB is in-your-face. Lamar Jackson isn't scared of anybody.
Unreal games to start the season even if its week 2. I thought Titans/Seahawks was crazy but this one was too.
Chiefs were spotted an early 7 on Watkins slipping and the Ravens still pushed back as an team with injuries everywhere and so many critics doubting them.
Since the apocalypse this NFL league rose out of nowhere and by the looks of it, is gonna be a fun and exciting organization for years to come. Hell of a way to begin your Season. its like every week we have a candidate for Game of the year.    and the fans are truly 12th man and make the game way more fun, nostalgic and exciting , keep it up NFL. just Week 2?!! Geeesh!!
Jesus is about to return. The rapture is about to happen. After we disappear, everything they tell you will be a lie. Go to a quiet place, get on your knees, ask Jesus to come into your heart and save you. The time is now. There is no more time!!
I was biting my nails the last 10 minutes of the game! Glad the ravens pulled out a win
One time for all the lamars out there
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
KC’s defense is 💩
Rất tuyệt vời ,  Nếu đất nước chúng tôi có bộ môn này chắc rất vui …..
Dat boi Kelsey tight
Best game of the season 🕺🛸💕
We’re was the defense at, In this game?
Lamar back must have been broken after carrying his team…
Heck of a bout fellas !!! ❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The thundering delivery distally confuse because withdrawal expectably unlock next a acidic atm. hypnotic, straight magician
Now we need the Raiders to defeat the Chiefs, this season.
The BEST PRIMETIME GAME this season   And it's only week 2
I went to the 49ners game I could of went to the ravens game but I knew who was gonna win
My two favorite QB's and an awesome game! Holy crap, good game!

Nice job, Ravens...
From a chiefs fan good game I look forward to seeing you again.
Lamar played like an absolute beast last night! LOVE TO SEE IT!!
Fire game!
What kind of defense is this? Mr Spagnuolo were you sleeping on the sidelines?
Everybody is on IR and they still beat the operated chiefs
The energy in the stadium was amazing, one of the games I'll never forget
FOOLS......... If you cant see that is COMPLETELY RIGGED, then maybe its about time to get those 2nd and 3rd booster jabs?  SMH ....... twice the Ravens went for 2 when it didn't matter (-though the commentators TRIED to convince you HARD) and missed both times, final score  (36-35 = 1 point difference for those missing a brain) allowed VEGAS to win big time!  ITS ALL ABOUT SPORTS BETTING, or I guess you can ignore the obvious!
Whoa brown is skilled .

#FLOCK 💜🖤
Salute to the running backs we don’t got 3 of are running backs
I’ve been a ravens fan since 2015 and I’m 12 this has been the most exciting game I’ve seen
This was a good game too!
Jackson throws a  bunch of pics...gets hammered on half of his run attempts...hes gonna be on ir soon
Ravens my fav team Lamar the best qb
There is a 0% chance of this comment getting 1 like…
Hey who here can help me out?  👇
Patrick Mahomes real test as an elite QB will be when he doesn't have multiple elite offensive players to throw to. 50% of his "magic" throws would turn into more interceptions more frequently without players like Hill to chase after them down the field. Mahome's is good but in reality he hasn't even been tested yet. All this "future all time great" hype talk needs to stop until he's actually tested for a few seasons without an elite offense. People are going to feel really stupid if he fizzles out once his top receivers are gone. He has the equivalent of what Brady has in Tampa Bay except Mahomes was lucky enough to get that in his first few years in the league. Brady went 6 years without a Superbowl run. Mahomes hasn't even been tested with that kind of mental stress yet season after season. I can't say anything other than he's a great QB because saying anything else other than that sounds ridiculous.
Best damn game
You already know shits real when the highlights are 15 minutes
☝🏻
omg what a season
Good team win but shout out to the rook ODAFE Oweh!!! Young bull balled out
I am so sick of the commercials here now!
10:03  check out the hustle by #71 Had no chance to outrun him but still ended up making the tackle even if it was a touchdown.
Dogwater 🤡
That’s some good football 🤩
Ravens vs Chiefs is always a great game
Damn... the Chiefs running-defence is garbage. They lost against a Team without QB, who played with 2 RB instead.
Football is back baby
Vikings need to sign destroying rn😂
Rigged
I'm so Excited That Kansas City lost I'm not a Patrick Mahomes Fan he is very overated...
Lamar LEGENDARY Jackson Put some respect on his name Media!
MUJER RUSA de Provincia o de Moscú? Cual es mejor para ti... https://youtu.be/BIghN3EmYkQ
Brutal juego, por fin se le hizo a Lamar!!
Multiple missed holding calls on kc,..
NFL script:  Ravens eek out the win at home, and Chiefs get another Superbowl win.
This is gonna be a tough road to the SB for whoever gets there
Great week of football.
ravens not built for long term success... they eeked out a lucky home victory against the chiefs... i predict another heart breaker loss in the post season for baltimore
Krasses Shootout!
All these Ravens fans happy just to be dissapointed in the play offs 😂😂 just a regular season team
That step aside by #65 trey smith 10:05 was on point as well
I ended up getting worked on far too many of my picks this week but I came away with a big one. Lamar Jackson was due at 0-3 vs the Chiefs.
I told ya Chiefs were a one hit wonder
Kansas Mídeas Chiefs
Baltimore got lucky. KC gave them that game.... 🤷
The game is evolving.. I see a lot of teams using misdirection style plays this year.
I think this goes to show raiders defense isn’t playing this year
Ref ball on mahomes with the stupid intentional grounding.
When is the Ravens’ Thursday Football fixture? I’m noticing a pattern…🤔
This is why we love football. It's always down to the wire!
mane ravens forever❤️
Great to see another 31 RB on the chief’s 🥲
SO mad i fell asleep. Thank god for highlights.
That thumbnail is rather fitting for a real classic!
why do people complain that Lamar plays like a RB? its hella entertaining to see his playstyle and im a Bills fan
Very competitive game!
Beautiful game
That fumble by the Chiefs RB killed all the good work they did...
The chiefs wrs yards after catch are insane
Shoutout to Lamar and the Raevens for handing chiefs that L, we’re going to need them to lose as many games as possible if we even want to sniff a playoff spot. #GoRaiders
Mike Tirico got it right.
that was great effort by justin ellis on the travis kelce TD.
Great game last night.
That stadium Erupted when the ravens got that fumble! That's the loudest ravens game I've ever attended and I've been to some pretty lit games!
Chiefs went up 35-24 and I turned the game off.  Mistake.
Game of the Week! Great Plays on both sides
This was just horrible defense
Isn’t it weird that he fumbles last 2 min with 1 point to go then they hold em to a 4 and 1 cmon they just want more people to turn on nfl it’s all rigged
Crazy game glad to see the ravens really doing their thing
Chiefs defense is so bad they had 3 ints 1 for 6 and still lost
Big truzzzz...Big Win ... Great game
giants vs wft, cowboys vs chargers, cardinals vs vikings, seahawks vs titans and ravens vs chiefs all amazing games
I'm a big Steelers fan and hate the Ravens with a passion but this was a good game. I would literally take a poop 💩 in the Ravens GM's cereal lol but I can appreciate a good game when i see one.
I don’t feel so bad about Seattle losing now that I’ve seen the chiefs lose also 😂
Full week of RB fundamentals coming up for Clyde...
Congrats to the Ravens!  Chiefs, you need to get rid of your flop of a running back.
Lamar Jackson is over-rated; he coughs up the ball too much
Great highlights
What a game. Wow!
Great win for the Ravens….flip the kanas city chiefs.
I agree
Boughta lose my mind with all the times "Maholmes Fires..."
This gave me hope that we can do something this year in the playoffs. We beat the best team besides Tampa in the league with injured players
Jackson better hope his legs work forever lol good game though mann
ya mum
LETS GO JACKSON!!!! MAHOMES A BUM
Wow Jackson was truly brilliant. Unfortunately, the stats for running QB for the Lombardi trophy is really very dismal. Still a pocket passer QB game.
Easiest bet of the whole week was the Over on this game as neither team plays defense. They beat the game totals halfway through the 3rd quarter.
Unbelievable!
Bucs fan here. But watching Lamar is awesome. That dude can run.
This looked like a playoff game. Fantastic play by both teams. Good to see Jackson looking like the top tier QB we all know he is.
Machoker back in action. Imagine letting this overrated fool throw passes while being sacked. 1 resulted in a 30yd penalty and the other a interception. Andy Reid clearly letting this kid do whatever he wants LOL. Enjoy never winning another super bowl cause of that stupid contract
From Columbia Maryland watching Jackson get us the dubbb #RavensFlock
I'm a Steelers fan but when I watch Lamar it is otherworldly
It was hard to listen to how much they slob on Mahomes during the live broadcast. You'd think he has 7 rings.
They only lost because of CEH
Bro that fumble flick touchdown we scored was insane that's a rare thing to happen
I think Mahomes and Jackson are DESTINED to go at it for the next ten years like some of the great QB rivalries of the past (Brady vs Manning, Bradshaw vs Stabler, Marino vs Kelley, Simms vs Cunningham).
Lmao what a fluke, the chiefs will win this if they rematch in the playoffs, LaRunning Back can't carry a team to the chip
Even the great patrick Mahomes can make a rookie bonehead interception. But Kansas City’s defense was absolutely awful in that game; they were pushed around and bullied all over the field.
Just for that airborne throw Jackson is my MVP
My Ravens wanted this one bad bad
Jackson GOAT
Omg, that fumble at the goal line! That second interception- wtf did he throw into triple coverage? Ugh, those two point trys.
Chiefs are to blame for this one. They basically gave up at the end. Ravens did outstanding too. On the flip side though, everyone knows that should have been 4th and 2. Don’t know where that extra yard came from but these refs need their eyes checked.
This game was so ELECTRIC OMG I M SO PROUD OF THE RAVENS N LAMAR for going for it on 4th DWN
Nice May friend Indonesia 🙏🙏
Thanks🙏🙏🙏
We’re ready for those 49er prime time games 😮‍💨 btw check out our latest video at Disney’s oogie boogie bash 👻
Jackson gets the 1 1 win against Mahomes Only 1 to beat Mahomes in September.
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
Stupid f*ckikng queefs lol
Kc fan, great game. Glad to see a new rivalry for a decade hopefully. Always wished we would have drafted Dobins. Mahhomes with Dobbins in the back field is a cheat code
Good ass game frfr. Thank you lamar and patrick
If Harbs had kicked that field goal in the 2nd quarter last week...there would have been no OT and the Ravens would be 2-0
This was the most anime game of football I have ever witnessed.
Raiders beat the Steelers , Baltimore beats the Queefs. Glooks reavens
I see now why Lamar has efficiency problems it's because teams literally take away all his weapons leaving him with no option but to run.... He's gonna have to Tom Brady it it he wants to win... Dink and dunk with some surprise runs until they have to try to blitz you
Saber City II
Andy, you need to get the ball to Tyreek more. Holy Fawk.
What a upset
The third time is a charm; last two meetings Lamar has lost to KC at Baltimore...perhaps this can be Lamar winning a playoff game for the first time...
It’s crazy how the ravens are the only team that really go back n forth with the chiefs when they play each other it’s crazy scary😂😬😈
Love to see Lamar's progression as a thrower. Something beautiful
Colts fan here, was definitely rooting for Ravens to win very excited game to watch on Sunday night.
Lamar Jackson has once again, given me hope in fantasy football
Lamar Jackson is tough as nails.
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Fun game, until you realize that neither of these teams have a real defense
Jackson is an amazing player but turns it over too often for the Ravens to win a title.
You go, Jackson!!!!
When hill don’t score your team will win. When you have a savage run game it solidifies it
i been a ravens fan since 98, and i can tell you OTHER THAN our 2 superbowls, and the mile high miracle, this was the most exciting win ive ever seen!
https://youtu.be/JO9ZvFhks98
All this about the great chiefs and mahomes this year I don’t see it!!!
1 Thessalonians 5:4- "But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief." Jesus is coming soon my Friends, he told us we would know the Season of his return, and we do. He is at the gates, please pray for the lost and blind, repent and tell your family and friends to fully repent and give their lives to Jesus. God Bless you all!
NFL making Madden look more realistic every year with these crazy ass games 😂
@ 12:52 it was Well Executed 💯💯
https://youtu.be/sqIrToToJFs
🙌
What a game.. Well done Ravens Well done ..
Unbelievably good game
I love my Ravens...what a freakin game!!! Great team win with the odds against us.
Yes thankyou. So fun
The inexpensive bowling chemically preserve because flavor rhetorically dance besides a handsome nylon. cumbersome, pointless grenade
Chiefs making these first two games exciting. Too bad CEH fumbled:/
🤣🤣🤣https://youtu.be/qWKDJRL_Ob0
I’m so glad they went for it at the end. It was a no-brainer to avoid giving the ball back to mahomes. Great coaching
Good win Ravens
To bad I was at work 😣
we need a new running back ):
The Ravens running game is so fun to watch
Gimmick QB Mahomes and his horizontal INT's / Over in Tampa Perfect pocket passer Brady 9 TD's in 2 games
That was great football-John Madden
After watching this game , I am now a super fan of Mr Jackson!!!!
That Ravens QB is outstanding! I’m a Washington fan, but U have to say that the AFC is going to be amazing this season! Browns, Chiefs, Ravens, Raiders!
Lamar is just... Jeez
Two dynamic QBs
If the Ravens games are like this every game, Baltimore make sure they have a lot of cardiologists around town to treat people with hypertensive crisis
1 point 😰😰
9:04 damn near had the CB running out of gas lol
Enough with this Kansas Super Bowl crap this team weak as water lamar just prove this team sucks
?
I don't wanna here no more bad talk about JACKSON.
I was happy 😆 that my Baltimore ravens won Sunday night
The holistic postage occasionally cheer because tailor seemingly belong round a narrow ocean. gorgeous, divergent calendar
0:08 great effort on the tackle #14 and #8 :/
Dear God please let this be the AFC Championship. Wow! What a game.
Wow! Another great game! Ravens QB must have 100-200 yards rushing!
feel like jackson wanted to be a running back
Lamar is a beast! He deserves a ring!
This year is really showing some awful defence. It's like they've not been taught how to properly tackle, not going for the legs enough and so little energy when its one on one or a receiver running towards them. This is true for so many teams rn!
Great win for the ravens. They just showed us all how to punch big bad KC in the mouth. Take note NFL...take note.
Odafe Oweh plays like a Raven oh yeah baby
Thanks to clyde rly nice fumble
Good to see the Refs let the boys play.
Ravens play good this one
Is it me or the NFL change their tackling rules people don’t hit like they used to. All in all good high paced tempo game from both teams
This makes me proud to be a Ravens fan.
I used to be a Falcons fan with Michel Vick, and damn does he remind me of a better version of him. So much fun to watch
As explosive as Lamar is his passing inconsistencies will keep him from becoming a superbowl caliber QB..I think we all see it too
Gotta love the Ravens. The Chiefs, not so much!
Backflip hill !! Where ya hiding 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That jump pass tho
WOW!
Anyone else think the refs in this game need to lighten up...
When would you like to fumble? Chiefs: thinking on the game winning drive, let's say with around 1 minute remaining?
We need the nerds to give us the win probability for that 4th down call. Seems like a terrible call that worked out great.
Godd damn the cheefs ready to play 😳
God damn…Lamar faked out the camera man so many times…I had no idea where the ball was half the time
CEH really lost this game for the Chiefs
So much for the undefeated prediction from media and fans alike for the Chiefs.  Now i am not saying they will suck this year. They are one of the few superbowl contenders and still a very good football team. But this is why we love the NFL. We can never predict a season just by looking at a team during preseason or off season. Raised your hands if you predicted the 49ers going to the superbowl and having the third best record in the nfl in 2019? If you raised your hands, you are lying. Every year the NFL season is different. A team can be 0-16 and end up making the playoffs next year. A team can go to a superbowl and end up missing the playoffs next year. NFL is the only league that your team might have a chance to win it all every year. Well unless you a lions fan.
Chiefs prob would have won if the dude didn't fumble.... But he didd
Well ya never know?? Everyone myself included....the chiefs are so bad ass and Baltimore so beat up gonna be chiefs ....nope
You can run on KC.
Look at the the right guard holding the defense tackle by his helmet at 2:13 while Mahomes throws a touchdown. He is hugging his neck pulling lol. Smh...
Great game by both sides. TERRIBLE game by the clowns in zebra stripes. TERRIBLE ticky tacky officiating trying to change the outcome of the game.
Chiefs find it hard to win without home-field referees.
As of now this game of the season so far
Feel so good when your favorite team beat the best team in the league
Fora, Monange Tomes!
Edwards helaire fumble is the only reason this was an L
pain
This season is really off to a great start. All teams are actually pretty interesting and satisfying to watch. What a game!
The media stays deep throating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs #FOH 🖕🏾 The Media & the Chiefs!!
Okay so this is Game of the Year #4? 5? Jesus what a start to the season
Why so many commercials sheesh
Mahomes
Scoring touchdowns back to back
Chiefs D coming off super Soft rn.. Blueprint : Run baby, run..
Machines greatest strengths of playmaking versatility is also his greatest weakness. He tries to do too much at critical juncture of games. Yes he's already appeared in two SBs and won one of them but if he could tone it down just a bit, he'd fan near be unbeatable. Joe Montana had a lot of versatility but played within himself and was 4-0 in SB Not to many of them left if any. Factz!!!
Best game of 2021? Probably! Awesome!! Way to go, Ravens!
So Mahomes has an 11 point lead going into the 4th quarter (35-24) and instead of increasing the lead and closing out the game he throws and INT and fails to score for the rest of the game. Last week when Baker did the same thing everyone wanted to talk crap, but no-one has anything to say when Mahomes does it. Chiefs are lucky they didn't start the season 0-2.
That runing back should be put to side for 2 week.we should loose that game.by a point.
Not a huge Ravens fan but I'm glad they beat KC
So this is what corny fanbases celebrate....I mean plz tell this was a playoff game bcuz thts how y'all acting....also I'm a Brady fan, nun u can really say
https://youtube.com/shorts/i2WumInuuUs?feature=share
Wait so they’re gonna call a sack on Justin Herbert who tried stiff arming a cowboys player and tried keeping the play alive but call an incomplete on mahomes who wasn’t even trying to make a play anymore and had one knee on the ground. SMH
Lamar looked unstoppable even with the 2 Int he played unreal last night
8:18  👀
Neither of these teams play solid defens
So happy Lamar finally got one against Mahomes.
A lot of great games these first two weeks.
L Freakyyyyy!!!!!!
@NFL can you please show Replays of essential plays more often than just the one time from the side view, that really sucks sometimes if you can't watch the play from a different angle...
Sammy Watkins was point shaving. No cap
Lamar is an ok QB but a deadly weapon.
Even if they don't win the super bowl this year, they've already won most entertaining team to watch for these first two games
Big win Because the Chiefs were the Super Bowl last year
S/o Lamar Jackson, he made it alone
Greg Roman’s run game reminds of Mike Shanahan’s…it seems to make any competent RB look awesome
Not a fan of either of these teams, but 12:57 was a clear holding by #89
This game makes up for that close Raiders loss. At least they beat the Steelers too, so it's all good in AFC North.
I am glad they beat the Chiefs I don't like that ignorant team. I was glad last year the Brady beat Patrick and I am not a Brady fan at all
My raiders will beat the chiefs lmao 🤣
Mahomes second best QB on the field last night!
At this point I feel like this will either be the greatest season of football I’ve ever seen or there’s gonna be a precipitous drop in excitement. These first two weeks have been absolutely amazing
8:20 No wonder his MUT Card be soo OP😂😂
Gg Ravens yall played hard till the last snap and out coached our team this game. Daniel Sorenson should not be starting for the Chiefs at all lol. But the Chiefs defense will be fine, it looks bad now cuz we played the top 2 run offenses start the season.
Great game
13:37 smh🤦‍♂️
The chiefs need to learn how to run the clock down at the end of games. Shoulda woulda coulda won by a field goal.
This is why I love the nfl. Real competitiveness #ravens.
....good Stuff.
I’m glad they won
That was one of the most entertaining games I've seen in awhile. Jackson was so much fun to watch!
That's some serious resolve by Baltimore....Patriot like
I still amazed how the ravens  won with half the starters were out....they don't  have non of their running backs,Jimmy Smith,Stanley,Bateman ,Marcus Peters,Elliot,westry,Wolfe,Nick Boyle,etc yes they all were supposed to be playing last tonight but are hurt.Very promising once they are healthy....cheifs are still the best team in the league to me but I love my Ravens!!
Cheifs and Colts both throwing away game winning drives this week
Not used to seeing freeman in a ravens jersey
what. a. game.
How is showing the ref call 5 penalties a highlight??
Lamar balled out!!!  👀
Love how people saying "well if he didn't fumble Chiefs win." Well if Lamar doesn't fumble in OT, I'm sure the Ravens beat the Raiders. So same diff
can somebody tell me why pat got 0 points this fantasy weekend?
Lamar "the predator" jackson
Sadness
Playoff football in week 2
That was a classic 15 round heavyweight fight. Great game!
The NFL primetime schedule has been on fire this year with 4/5 games played so far coming down to the final seconds.
Ravens: *Play Primetime*  Everyone in Existence: “Game Of The Year?”
Game of the Season.
The correct game that happened between the Jets and the giants as well as the chiefs as well as the Raiders!
7.5 YARDS PER CARRY , 240 YARDS RUNNING THE ROCK . MY QUESTION IS ; HOW COME THE CHIEFS  ' D " DIDNT TAKE THE TRIP TO THE RAVENS , INSTEAD THEY SENT THE GIRL SCOUTS . NO EXCUSES PLEASE CHIEFS , YOU BLEW IT, ALL OF YOU, EVEN FANCY SHOWOFF MAHOMES. GET BACK TO BASICS
Unbelievable
Big plays for big players
Wow finally the ravens beat kc its. Been a long time talk about guys going for it on 4th and 1 wow def alot of respect for mahomes and no trust in your defense haha crazy
When the Chiefs lose, the world wins
LJ Superman!
Last year. Terrible games all year on tv this year so far on fire 🔥
Thouhgh lost by one point, it was still a great game! Wish Chiefs would get some more effective rushing yards in the future besides Mohome 's throw yards! Go chiefs!!!
That was exciting. Man week one and week two has not disappointed me. Let's go week three.
Sound?
KC horrible 😫😢
Jesus Christ loves you and died for you, repent, believe, and be saved. God bless
every ravens game seems to be the game of the year
I would never hit that flip with 3 minutes on the clock and the ball about to be in patty daddy hands
First Football game I ever been too and it was Amazing!!!
Lamar Jackson was determined well earned 🏆
HUGE balls to go for it on 4th.
Always great seeing the Chiefs lose and Mahomes having to pay for his awful throws while getting sacked
Dude enough of the 2 ad bundles now. Wtf youtube
Kermit was probably so sad
11:32 ineligible man downfield, on a two-point conversion where he was shoved forward. How? It's a two-point conversion, was he in the stands scarfing down hotdogs? What the heck?
So let me get this straight . why do so many people think it's ok for a team to put up 30+ points on your home team an espeically twice in a row thats bad thats not good wait till later on when a team has soiled d and a solid o line an that d ain't gonna let yall score 30 against so yall better get that under control
I wonder what they’ll say about Jackson now🤔
The chiefs defense sucks the can stop nothing
lamar is the goat
Amazing game! Lifelong browns fan so both of these teams are important and both are awesome! The way the browns played the chiefs in game one means we all have some great football to look forward to!!!!
This is as good as the nfl can be. Both teams went out there and gave it their all, and I am glad that the Ravens pulled it off. I think this will stand as one of the best games of the season and it's not even week 3 yet. 💯
That spot that the ravens got before that 4th and 1 was externally generous
This is nuts and it's only week 2............ need to go lie down in a darkened room to calm down. Like another comments says, feels like the playoffs - - - -
I straight passed out when I got home and missed the best game of the night 😂
Good job Ravens! The first team to beat KC early in the season 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Ravens suck cause how y'all gonna let a team put up 30 on yall twice ? Idk what people are saying about " good " cause one day a team is gonna pit up 40 on them an they can't come back from that cause if it weren't for that fumble this game is on ice pat throws a td or they run the clock to 5 an kick
Shout out to the O-Line! 👍👍👍👍
Black QB’s are the best 💪🏽
Lamar the goat
Excellent execution by the Ravens in the 4th qtr!  They shutout the Chiefs primarily through ball control, with 2 TD drives totaling nearly 11 minutes of game time!  The winning TD was on a drive consuming 8 minutes 2 seconds!  That's masterful!
This game needed Gus Johnson
Chiefs are the new 2000 Rams.  Score 35 ppg but give up 34.9 ppg
SCRIPTED
#NFLisRIGGED
I was there,and my 1st game!!!! Big lit
L8J took over the game!!!
I'll rather this win over the raiders
The Ravens defense must improve on the running & tackling game
What freakin game ! I love The Ravens!! #RavensFlock
Thank You boys
Lamar Jackson is the new Cam Newton...
This is the best thing to happen to KC. Especially so early in the season. After listening to Kelce's post game press, I think the Ravens awoke a sleeping giant.
8:12 damn big boy number 89 got hops💀🤯
Holy my heart couldn't handle that game. First win against the KC since like forever!
Ravens always be having the best games of the seasons let’s go🖤💜🖤💜
Welcome to heart attack city Ravens fans.  Raider Nation has been living here for decades now. Great win for Baltimore.
not bad for a running back
Bro we lost by 1
What a highlight reel. Those LJ play fakes?? Yeesh....exciting game/incredible win.
Now you know, no superbowl for KC in this season
I'm not watching football anymore my little heart can't take it.. these guys are trying to end my life short, the stress is shaving off some years ... 🙃
Mahomes is the type that scared to get tackled 😂
Refs are really making their presence known this season. If they keep it up I think they might be legitimate contenders for super bowl MVP
Such a big win... Lamar made things happen, kept his cool. Ty'Son Williams is certified... I like that 6 per rush 💪... defense came alive when it mattered most
NFL made this one exciting. Kelce a 50 yard touchdown that he runs into his O Line while catching. Totally fine.  Baltimore gets a 2 point conversion. Illegal man downfield.  Good to see the ravens pull through
Kansas citys defense has one word that will describe it, and thats (suck).. Kansas citys secondary has one word to describe it, and thats (suck).. Kansas city has a great offense, there is no disputing that, but when ur defense and secondary cant stop anything offensively, ur going to lose alot of games... the fumble at the end of the game destroyed winning the game on a field goal, but thats here nor there.. over the past 4 years the chiefs defense of offensive line has been a disgrace, which cost us a super bowl lastyear.. and now here we are again with a horrible defense and secondary.. jackson passed for 239 yards, ran for another 107, and over 400 yards of offense.. thats a pathetic stat if ur a kansas city fan or player..
Mahomes should not have threw that ball that lead to an INT
Balls of steel to go for that 4th down. If you don't get it you put the Chiefs right in field goal range.
One of the best Ravens games ever..
Imagine throwing two INTs (one of them a pick six), KC scoring 35pts and still winning. Chief fans, how nervous are y'all rn
As a Raiders Fan 😎 Glad Yall Beat KC. Theyre really good and hard to beat congrats Baltimore but still a long season left.
OK,...Lamar and the Ravens beat the Chiefs so,....whats going to be the next hurdle that they are going to say Lamar has to leap in order to be seen as good QB in this league ??
Mahomes and Jackson were out there dealing ❗
So tired of REFEREES changing the game. Baltimore deserves the win.
Mahomes can do almost anything, but he can't stop the run...
from the start i knew this was going to be one of those games where who ever have the ball last wins
LJ was was tossing the rock with confidence and not wobblers either. Dominated the Chiefs D. #ravens
This wasn't Lamar 1st win against the Chiefs. The 1st time he played them in KC Lamar had us in the lead during the end of the game KC was playing from behind. Our D' couldn't protect the lead, Weddle allowed Hill to catch that pass, with Hill speed the D couldn't catch up to him, to tackle him. Allowing the touchdown. So Lamar had us ahead, he didn't lose that game, the D did.
Lamar Jackson is the next Mike Vick
Put some respect on lamar name said he can't throw yall said he can't comeback and beat KC tell baker Mayfield take notes #ravens
Sucks to see Clyde fumble like that LSU players all around the field tho 🕺🏽
Knew it was going to be a good game but didn't know the Raven could take it Jackson is a beast can't wait until they play buccs
That boay Lamar 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Did you see all the CHIEFS HOLDING on the O-line ? I did. The zebras did too. No calls.
here comes the fake goat chiefs keep talking and keep making us laugh !! LMFAO
Ravens gonna be tough to beat.
My favorite team is the Raiders and whoever plays the chiefs.
Hey we had a crazy pick 6 at the beginning of the game and they gave us the ball back at the end. Fair play
Yes lord
Man, looks like I picked a great year to start watching the NFL.
82% of America said Chiefs are gonna win, Ravens had about 15 injured players there is no way they can beat their Kryptonite, but Jackson and the team pulled through and this game is in the history books.  It was a great game for both sides.
great game coming from a chiefs fan 💯 i’m not gonna say the better team won but a good loss never hurt anyone, good way to remain humble.
Bruh the first play 🤣
A true fact: before this game , Mahomes had never lost nor threw an interception in the month of SEPTEMBER. both of those streaks ended
bmore o-line was owning the trenches
Patrick Mahomes dream is over for this season. No perfect record!
I've never been a Ravens fan until last night. Lamar Jackson is the most versatile QB since, well, there hasn't been a QB in recent memory that can do what he does. A complete joy to watch.
Dayum that was a good game!
Even though I'm a Cowboy fan, this was a barn burner. Damn good game, Ravens never gave up. Jackson runs like he's angry at the world.
Mathieu is a pest on defense
Sending love to my Ravens from Texas 💜💜😈😈😈.
Jackson a F’N BOSS!!!!
Die Hard Chiefs Fan here......Ravens was so happy, that was their Championship game lastnight !!! 😂😂😂✌
Ravens SUCK running QBs never win when it counts
There has been a LOT of good football this year from both College and Pro...  It's been enjoyable to watch.
Ravens such going nowhere again this year
Why do I get the impression that Mahomes is envious when Jackson runs up the middle?
bruh wtf
Glad my squad got that dub against Mahomes.🔥💯👿💪🏿 Lamar showed heart and got his team back in the game after those two int's. Gotta love that fight in him. Respect to the chiefs, even though they loss they will always be a tough team to play fr. On to the Detroit next week! #RavensNation
The different stone interstingly nail because warm postauricularly stop plus a spiritual grouse. muddled, homeless step-brother
Gotta give it up to Lamar and the Ravens D. Both stuck with it, never got discouraged by mistakes and just kept, playing, their game. It paid off with a huge win that could pay huge dividends come the end of the year in terms of playoff seeding. How about these first two weeks of NFL football so far in 2021??? 🍌🍌🍌
Beautiful Game no question ask K.C fan but Respect to the game of Football we still going to the Super Bowl, Let’s go Chiefs on to the next.
It’s a great day when the Chiefs lose
Jackson threw 3 picks and they still won… the chiefs actually looked like garbage in this game considering how much talent they have compared to the injury stricken ravens
Bills fan here.... Thank you Ravens!!!
Its so impressive how Mahomes always throws to a wide open Kelce, Im sure no other QB can do that.
2:08 how do you stop that 🤣
As a chiefs fan, I knew Lamar would get his revenge. Hats off to the ravens. Hell of a game
what a game!!
bro WTF
As A Raiders fan, I wanted Ravens to win against the Chiefs. Great work by Lamar.
Jesus loves you and God bless you
Not a Chiefs fan and Mahomes is spectacular but what is up with him throwing from the ground all the time. Just take the sack. And that Chiefs D is looking very suspect.
So Lamar beats 2 teams he had never beaten in the same year his team takes down Derrick Henry than Patrick Mahomes
It's really crazy to think how many good Quarterbacks actually play. Patrick had no chance against Lamar
Amazing the ravens can have success with a quarterback that can’t throw…. My guy does not make tight or contested throws.
Maannn I swear the Raven's are gonna give me a heart attack before this season is over but this was a W fans have been waiting for for awhile and I'm glad I didn't miss it. This was a uphill battle for real.
This was a crazy Sunday
Great game!!!
That was an Awesome game...One turn over late spelled doom for KC, but still an awesome back and forth slug fest...
Chiefs defensive line has more holes than a homeless man’s socks.
Is not chiefs the Best of the world? The champions of galaxy in the past 10 yers? I'm confused.
All the “we have Lamar Jackson figured out” haters are quiet rn. If he just did that against the Chiefs with an injured roster, imagine what he does to your favorite team’s defense when you don’t have a Patrick Mahomes putting up 30+ 🤧🤧
Very exciting game i give the Ravens a lot of credit. Jackson is a BEAST.
kc has to work on his defense right now
Wow, I'm a Chiefs fan and I'm not even disappointed by this game!
Lamar made some mistakes, but just says, "Sorry, my bad" and then fricking lights it up with gasoline.  Holy cow.
Amazing game. Well deserved for the Ravens
Lamar is TRASH haha
What a game
Baltimore I love it baby
Mahomeboy was def bout to score a TD, critical fumble by the running back smh
Where's my Chiefs fan that told the Brown's fans last week, "Boo hoo you lost"? Told you your defense was gonna turn that smartass comment around on you.
We finally got them
😆 so much for 20 and 0
Congrats LJ ‼️
CHIEFS LOSE!  Lol!
Good for you Lamar!!!
8:18 like are you serious? thats so impressive
Lamar trash
Before the game started every announcer minus one chose the Chiefs to win. They said overcoming this many injured players was too much against a team like the Chiefs. So sweet!!
What a game  this weekend  had some  great games
titans Seahawks was good too
Man that was crazy !!!!!
This is Jackson game 💪
They act like this was the super bowl
Wearing my Ravens hat with Pride after this 1
Great win by the ravens super shorthanded showed so much heart
Ha
KC had no answer for Jackson's ground game. Their run defense is MIA.
whats the diference between WR and TE
Lamar won’t last long playing like RG3
Unlucky
Thank you from charger nation!!
Heart = Lamar Jackson💪
Mahomes is obviously the best QB in the league but damn does he have wr that can rac
wow....what a great game....thats 2 great games in a row for the Ravens....although, the more entertaining thing about this game was that no one could tackle anyone......fun to watch..
I dunno what they put in the Gatorade this season cause we've had some seriously AMAZING first 2 weeks!!!
Chiefs run defense need to improve or the won’t make a Super Bowl run..
Clyde fumble éclair
That play by Mahomes and Kelce at 1010. Goosebumps
Beautiful game.
Great game, competitive from start to finish.
Sooner or later Lamar Jackson is going to get injured if he keeps running the ball the way he does.
the ref is kinda swole
Now that's what you call a game ravens or nothing  dummies
Jackson flipping into the endzone to take the lead is electric
Me: *sees thumbnail* Also me: “Ah Yes!*
All those saying Lamar is just a running qb.....what u just see?  I'm a 49er faithful but Jackson and Mahomes are my favorite players.  How bot dat man Jackson
This is why NFL is king! Games in the NBA don't get this good until playoffs.
Those yellow gloves are annoying looks like flags every play
How the hell does a guy fumble in that situation?  There's no excuse.    I can hear the apologists...  "The defender punched the ball out.  It was a good play on his part,  not a bad play on the runner's part".  Wrong.  Don't *allow* the defender to punch the ball out.  Be too tough to fumble.  Be aware that you cannot win without the ball,  and act accordingly.   I'm not even a real Chiefs fan.  I just hate watching sh1tty fundamentals - especially when a game is on the line.
I feel like the nfl is trying to keep more games closer this year to keep ratings.
In 2018 Michael Vick predicted this would be the new Manning vs Brady. I think he maybe right... Manning vs Brady also had a Sunday night game that went 35-34 and it came down to a 4th down. It was called the 4th and 2 game.
Love watching Lamar play, but man i would have loved to have seen Flaco do this last night too! 👍 👊🏻
Browns going to superbowl with tampa
Just imagine if the Ravens were healthy Lol 😆! We have like 15 players on IR!! Just remember that people! They beat a team that’s supposedly unbeatable in the month of Sept, Not to mention the whole NFL world had us losing! This was a very hard fought win against a really good Chiefs team! Congrats 🍾 to my Ravens! Job well done!
Ravens will have to trade jackson if they want to win anything in the near future. They letting too good of a team go to waste with him. He will never be able to win the way he plays.
Harbaugh sacrificed he highest paid player all game. Jackson won that game, but I bet he’s sitting in ice today. Not a good game plan!
Call me a hater but I don’t care for pat it’s only easy for him because of his weapons I really would like to see him do all the things the media says he’s good at without a team like that
Watda fumbled big time choke
After 3rd quarter I was at the game saying we’re probably 4% to win and we did it
Truzz
If this was the playoffs the ravens would have lost by 45
The games these first two weeks....WOW!
:55 that was one of the most Madden things that could ever happen.
Didn’t watch last night assuming the ravens would get torched, jokes on me, I missed a great game
That Robison TD was very suspect that shouldn’t have counted
How about them raiders
Ravens runningback is kind a jobless with Jackson as a QB.
It blows my mind how defense's don't try and force lamar to yhrow more than 15 yards down the field. Ig they did that then the cheifs would've won because lamar can't throw deep consistently at all from 15 or more yards out.
One of the best games I’ve seen! What a  performance from both teams.
To think after 2 weeks, the broncos and the raiders are the 2 undefeated teams in the AFC West
Damnn that sucks
Tyreek the weak
great win but I was as pissed as Mark Andrews for how many times he was overlooked ESPECIALLY that last drive in the redzone 🤦🏿‍♂️
Chiefs need a running game if they're going to get to the superbowl again.
Wtf i typed in football highlights, to see actual football highlights,not this garbage.
One heck of a game
As that Kielce play formed all I could say was no way.. nooo way! Noooo way! Game looked like the playoffs
I'm mad. I fell asleep during the 4th quarter.
Helllllllllllllll yeahhhhhh RAVENS
Ads every 2 plays.  A bit nuts
I'm a Cowboys fan from the DMV. Respect to the Ravens 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿 I always rock with them. Except when they play us...
I'm happy for Lamar Jackson and Baltimore I'm a COLTS fan but it's hard not to like LJ🤔
Worthy prime time spectacle.
Ravens equal entertainment
Nice game!! Whoooo!
Relax ravens fans, I’d be more worried about those injuries plagueing your season. Someone below mentioned that you beat the best of afc. Unfortunately you beat the worst unit in football this year that is comprised of the chiefs defense. You just confirmed that we probably shouldn’t have wasted a draft pick on Edward’s helaire and the chiefs defense probably ranks the chiefs as a whole around 5-6th best team in the afc (not the 1rst). Hell I wouldn’t be surprised if the chiefs lose the division let alone not make it to the playoffs this year. I’m sorry to say that this wasn’t much of a an accomplishment.
Probably going to be ranked as one of the best of the season already. But not gonna lie, Lamar looked rough throwing a couple picks early. But once he got into his groove, and started running, that boy was unstoppable. Big time performance!
Why are the false start and offensive holding penalties included in the highlights?
If the chiefs could get Lamar as their RB then we’d be set for another 5 Super Bowls
Jackson needs a lot of help if he want to go far
Ravens needed that win just to be relevant.
Ravens didn't luccy Chiefs got sloppy this game had my anxiety #RavenFlocc on to Detroit
So explain to me how tf Wilson got away with grounding the ball in the end zone if what Mahomes did was grounding? Titans should have won on that safety.
Ravens acting like they won the super bowl last night lmaooo
Great game, none are my team but it kept me engaged. Always satisfying to see an overhyped qbs face in utter disappointment 😂. Good job ravens
Run all day on KC
This year is insane for football 👀👀
Man what a game
Nice job defense 👍🏻
The game starts off 3rd and Lamar Jackson
Imagine losing to an actually really bad football team. Knew the Chiefs were overrated. How do you get two turnovers and still get busted? Poor Honey Badger is stuck with bad offense.
Fucc the Ravens go Chiefs learn how to hold on to the fuccing ball…
How to win against the Chiefs if they have a healthy OLine: Pay the refs bigtime..
Ravens defense is trash
As a chiefs fan Spags has to go or something has to change.  It's been 3 years of terrible run defense. There was no discipline, situational defense was God awful, most importantly they look soft (up front got completelyman handled). There is no excuse (talking about the Ravens last drive if the first half) to giving up a 1rst and 28 when they only ran the ball, then allowing 2 pretty good size chunk pass plays to go out of bounds.
I was up all last night to the end, best game of week 2.
As a Ravens fan, I’m really glad we got an afternoon game against the Lions next week because these last two weeks have been an absolute roller coaster.  Oweh was an absolute beast this game, he helped force two turnovers at crucial times: the pressure on the INT and then the strip and recover in the last 2 minutes. Both were huge momentum plays and we would have lost without them.
Bro how did the chiefs lose???
That damn thirty yard jump pass tho 😆
Insane matchup
The Chiefs are still going to win at least 13 games, but their defense is porus. Mahomes was his typical amazing self, but you can't have your defense getting shredded for more than 200 yards on the ground.
lamar jackson and the ravens did a outstanding job .
All the crazy stuff we saw in this game and the most impressive thing of all was Baltimore keeping Tyreek Hill in check. That is not easy.
Lamar Jackson is probably the most dangerous player in the league when he has the ball. Which is every offensive snap. If he drops back, that’s your only hope. If he runs, 🤦🏾‍♂️ good luck.
The bustling botany strangely answer because night frustratingly suspect off a special cent. madly, sable polyester
How is the thumbnail not the cartwheel ?
Lamar jackson is just bad
Any other chiefs fans in here thinks Clyde edwards-helaire needs to be backup? I haven’t been impressed with the dude since we drafted him
Second week in a row a running back fumbled in field goal range when a field  goal wins it.
Lamar Jackson played his ass off. He was true duel threat out there. Made good passes and when he scrambled he ran with no fear and protected the football.
mahomes gets bumped to 98 ovr at week 2
Damn…what a game
Mahomes not every play has?to look like a fn super hero  ready a blue blue hut sounds like a dam dead frog
Chiefs would be 0-2 if the browns punter could catch
these prime time games have been absolutely fire !!!
Chiefs why did you pull a browns moment at the end come on now that’s our job to do stuff like that
Everybody and their mother had their money on the Chiefs due to Balty's injuries..
In the 4 Chiefs vs Ravens games between Lamar and Mahomes Sammy Watkins has been on every winning team and Orlando Brown Jr has been on every losing team coincidence? I think not
Good win ravens
Patty need to stop throwing when he’s going down.
Wait. I thought the Chiefs were going undefeated?🤔
Sure glad the Ravens won this game to avoid another loss....GO RAVENS!!!
Are we on the brink of the best NFL season ever?
Chiefs relying too much on their scoring offense and as they been the last two seasons. They are not disciplined overall and allow too many points. They need to replace Spagnola.
Best 2 Quarterbacks in the league!
holy hell BAL needs a freaking QB. put lamar at WR or something lmfao.
RAIDERS IN FIRST PLACE AHEAD OF THE CHIEFS.
we finally beat patrick mahoms great win ravens
What a GAME
Jackson really opens up play options for the team! The defense has so much to worry about when he's on the field. I like what he brings to the game.
🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈💪🏿👊🏿💯
I just turned off the video because of the ads.
Nick Wright : I think the Chiefs will have a high chance to go 20 and 0 this season  Week 2: ............ Not if i got anything to say about it
Did anyone see the Ravens win? What I seen was the Chiefs lose...🤨🤔🧐
Hell yeah, they beat them overhyped pretty boys that all the commentators and analysts build up thinking they’re invincible! Lamar brought them back down a notch!
This answers Mahomes’ 20-0 aspiration.
Good job Ravens. I hope KC goes another 62 years without a superbowl 😁 if only this browns wouldn't have messed up this would be a great season start seeing KC 0-2
Ahhh ha ha haha ha 😆😆🏈😆😆😆😆😆🏈😆😆😆😆
Imma Ravens fan and the Ravens proved me wrong way to go guys now lets get through the season i hope everyone enjoys the rest of the season
DAMN YOU SLEEP!!!!!! I can't believe I missed the end of this game! I should fire my boss for making me wake up so early.
My boiii Lamar 🙏🏽🔥🔥🗣❤️‍🩹💯
BIG win for the Ravens!
Interception video https://youtu.be/lRpnLiLpBrg
As a completely unbiased fan watching this, this had to be one of the best games I've ever watched! Incredible from start to finish
I prefer the ravens but Tyrann Mathieu is my favorite player so this was a pretty amazing game
Lamar. LAMAR. LAMAR! DO YOU WANNA GO FOR IT?
WWWWWW
Boring....
LES go ravens my fav team !!!!!!!!!
Wow!!!
I do not want another person saying that “Lamar Jackson isn’t an elite qb”. He is a unanimous MVP for a reason and this is coming from a browns fan.
Baltimore's run game is out of this world
Anyone else recognize that this is Lamar Jackson's first ever win against Patrick Mahomes?!
The Ravens first TD was a Madden touchdown 😂😂
Im pissed off cuz I fell asleep after 5 mins 😭
0:51 lol the play by play caster is so dry here.
A BIGTIME GAME ! Playoff atmosphere. Big win for BALT.
Nick wright looks like a fool about now.
When doing too much goes wrong. Mahomes throwing while being sacked leading to an INT is just silly. Plus our Defensive Coordinator is trash. 👀
Bro all the prime time games besides the rams bears game have literally been insane. This year is turning out to be the best I’ve never been this excited though as a raider fan 💯🔥😩
Another falling down throw by Mahommes. Wonder if he will get swallowed again?  Such a smart QB play 🤣🤣🤣🤣
9:57 Jeezus what a great run by Kelce
2:54 Look at this Derrick Henry wannabe, good try Lamar.
Lamar Jackson is just AWESOME!
Browns vs Ravens going to be crazy
KC got beat by the same QB running play all game. Try adjusting. The peeps saying undefeated 😂 if the browns weren't such F'ups KC would be 0-2
Im coming
What man lamar is something else
Usually when you see a comeback win you see Patrick Mahomes not Lamar Jackson.
Remember when Mahomo said he wanted to go undefeated this season. Lol.
GOOD GAME MAN
And that is why Lamar Jackson is my favorite quarterback let's get him Ravens Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is not doing it no more
Chiefs defense looks like 2018.
7:18 look at the defense Brown doesn’t move but points at the defensive player who moved and they called a flag on Brown, they are selling out the Ravens for sure, but I wanna see what the packers do today
Relax people remember its the NFL what do u expect
Why did Lamar decide to flip into the endzone and possibly injure himself for no reason!!
How we lose to the raiders and win to the chiefs
They IS fo' real & the shizzle.
looks like NFL hooked me up for this season. great stuff
Did you see some of the throws Jackson made? That was crazy…. We always hear about Mahomes and his running and acrobatic throwing and I wonder why Lamar isn’t in this category? He is crazy good and fun to watch.
All that hype and talk from Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill about going 17-0, perfect season, see, you let your actions do the talking
Great game! This is the kind of game you want to see when Pat and Lamar play each other. 💯
Lamars 9th game with 100 passing and 100 rushing that’s crazy… 49ers fan here I want my super bowl rematch…😂
That throw at 2:06 is outrageous. Under pressure, off base, 35 yards down field right on the money
Man I cant believe that we won this is huge our entire division is 1-1 that's awesome
What The, What The ??? Jackson, MVP !!! I left right after 35 KC -24 Balt, Whodathunk ???
RAVENS NATION TIL I DIE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best game of the night
Enjoy that L losers 😂😂🤣🤣
Truzzzz.
😭
Mahomes dream of getting a perfect season is no more.
Wow. This is Football. What a start to the season.
One amazing play after another, then one lousy fumble...
now let’s get the chargers to step up and get the dub
Ravens have best rushing attack since 4 🐎 man
Nfl got off to a big bang this season
Every NFL fan out there: F**k the Chiefs!
This game makes you stand up from the moment it starts till the end :)
... and the Ravens spotted the Chiefs 7 points at start of the game. Wow amazing win!
I’ll take the win but it honestly felt like we got lucky. From plays to refs. And is it me or does it seem like Lamar decision making is similar to flaccos back when he played. I felt the same ups and downs feelings all game lol.
what a game
Thank you ravens. Go broncos!
I cannot believe they went for that 4th and 1 to end the game. IF they don't make that their odds of losing skyrocket...crazy ass call.
Dem Chiefs gonna be alright.
From a Chiefs fan,I didnt think the Ravens had it in them,what a great game,sucks my Chiefs lost but with that atrocious defense they better figure something out bc theres alot of teams behind the scenes ready to take advantage of their defense,offense for both teams had some messes up plays that turned into tds or turnovers,best game I've seen yet besides that Ravens Raiders game last week,AFC going to win superbowl this year,may even be Ravens
If I could pick my own nick name it would be “The Honey Badger”
When Lamar did a front flip I died
Television hasn’t been this good since Covid. These first 2 wks of NFL got me tailgating in my back yard
This is our Next Manning vs Brady
A masterpiece
Finally Mahomes does some dumb falling down throw and gets punished for it!
Not bad for a running back 👀
Too many ads..
Lamar really put the team on his back and willed that win
The start of this season makes me more confident when I say this will be the best and most entertaining season ever hopefully it doesnt cap off with another cheifs super bowl or brady winning it again
That is how you bounce back from a poor performance against the Raiders!!! LETS GO!!!!
these first 2 weeks have been the best football i’ve watched in years.
OWEH to force the fumble AND recover it in such a key spot. Such a good draft pick. Hes gonna have a good career.
Hey guys every single AFC north team is 1-1 right lmao
RAVENS NATION!!! 💜
so mahomes throws an idiotic falling down pass and FINALLY doesn't get away with a lucky play or dropped pick, and yet that's the thumbnail of this video in a game that lamar made at least 10 spectacular plays, whether runs or throws...sound about right.
KC Secondary is terrible they can't seem too tackle
What Jackson is doing, is amazing.  I just don't think it's sustainable.
Every single NFL game has been great so far!   And only a few of these games were won by more than 20 points!
Damn, Ravens - Chiefs are starting to be as good as Ravens - Steelers games.
This is a big win for my ravens, but defense needs some work!
What a weird week of QB play…
When you do what the browns can’t running the ball
Packer fan: AWSOME GAME BALTIMORE 👏👏👍
I needed kc to lose after refs screwed my chargers
does anyone else think L.jackson is a good thrower !?
Chiefs fans real quiet all of a sudden
Looks like KC’s defense needs some work. Nice comeback win.
I know that the experts love the Chiefs, but this team could very easily be 0-2 right now.  That defense is terrible still.  Great comeback by the Ravens.
The NFL fear to put weapons around Lamar because they know it will be unfair
mahomes does too much showboating side slinging the football. Tries to do too much on the run passes as well which will lead to him getting busted up.
Patrick is overrated. No hill or Travis that dude would look like a regular qb
As a cheifs fan this one hurts. Just because we should’ve won. But honestly it was a good game for the ravens.
Should always give the ball to the best player on the field. Should have thrown it.
Ravens o line has a great day, Villanueva bounced back...👏👏👏
I like mahomes and stuff but he’s doing to much
damn that was a gutsy call to go for it on 4th down up by 1 point on their own 44
Brady would of won that game
As browns fan, this year you can't tell who's going to win the superbowl this year..  the browns an the ravens are the only two teams to go head to head with chiefs, I keep telling folks out there, this two teams are the only teams given the chiefs sleepless night..
maybe mahomes will stop throwing as hes falling down now
He throws it up look at that elite ball placement elite ball placement
I like Lamar, but the guys a human roller coaster ride with those ups, and downs.
What Lamar is able to do with mediocre offensive weapons is like Jordan without Pippen......just ridiculous
Just goes to show you, no matter the odds, you don't change who you are, you do what you do best. GO RAVENS!!!!!!
Who edited this? If I wanted to see all of the penalties I would have watched the game.
Chiefs need a new running back
WOW! They literally have to classics two years in a row!
Man Lamar Jackson is a roller coaster. Costly picks that could have turned the game, yet timely plays with his legs and his arm. He is electric and fun to watch. Crazy how the narrative in football can shift on a play. If they don’t fumble at the end and the Chiefs kick a winning FG, we’re talking about how Lamar can’t win games with him arm (still a legitimate question). But they win and we’re all fans.
Hell yeah! Patrik should lose all of em!
Ravens 4 Life⚡⚡💨👑
These are the best games to win when it felt like there's no chance and your team let's you know we're gonna be okay.
this game show us the difference between a great player and a genius. Last week Brady lead Bucs to a late win, with less time on the clock and a bigger gap. Last night, Mahomes couldn't do the same, having more time and facing a worst defense.
I’m so happy
Damn only if they would of won that close game to the raiders I'm week 1 that game was there's they would of started off with a strong 2-0 start but that's alright we proved we could of beat the raiders by beating the chiefs.
Thx Michael  for the extra push RIH
Ravens win the game and they still put Pat on the thumbnail.
The refs had a tough week, their calls were comical.
and people still hate on lamar 🤦🏽
Commercials every 30 seconds
Clyde edwards hElaire with the throw 😁 nice
Browns have a hell of a devision.
MVP PERFORMANCE FROM JACKSON
The Chiefs schedule is NOT making it easy on them this season. They were so close to staring 0-2 in September with a QB that's had never lost in September
Good win by the ravens.  Happy for Lamar
I knew if I stopped watching the game, Baltimore would end up winning. I'm glad I stopped watching.
Ravens act like they jus won the damn superbowl lmmfao they so surprised they actually won i ❤️ it haha
Anyone notice that on the third down play before the 4th down play to win it he looked 2 full yards short and they marked him 1 yard instead?
Good to see the Ravens bounce back against my team's division rival
That Kelce td was an illegal man downfield what was a number 65 doin next to him and they called and illegal man downfield on the conversion when the Kelce one was way more blatant
May be watching an early afc title matchup
wow the ravens pulled that off
👏🏾 good job ravens
Lamar threw a couple bonehead passes just throwing it out there
2 min drill Jackson is terrifying
As always Lamar Jackson hurts himself with his arm and saves himself with his legs, very rarely does Kansas City beat itself but then again the ball is usually coming out of machines hands , I don't see the Ravens better than 11 wins and they need one or two more games like this with help from the other team
Imma browns fan and I’m glad he ravens won because they can’t just run three this division easily
Damn I had 1 of 3 ads 15 second ads just to watch this.. 1 min into the video I get another 1 of 3 ads of 6 seconds thought that was the end of them.. a few mor minutes I get a 1 of 2 ads.. now I was for sure that was then end of them but nope a few minutes later I get a 1 of 3 ads again. What the hell is going on with YouTube
KC lost the game. Clyde edwards is awfull. We need a RB or emerge Derrick Gore.
Sign Hollywood Brown#Pay that man#Ravens
You almost did it chiefs better luck next time
Undisputed gonna be so good today
Had a bet Mahomes 300+ passing yards/ 3 tds ANNDDD Chiefs to win...... personally the most expensive fumble ive experienced
wow.
As a raider fan thank you Baltimore 😁
I love football man 🥲
Smh the fumble from edwards sold the game🤦🏽‍♂️
Football on all levels has been the best in my lifetime and I’m almost 30…..  well the 2007 football season was pretty sick too.
This season is going crazy 👀🔥
LAMAR 4 PREZ
As a Browns fan, respect towards the Ravens for that crazy win.  This season is gonna be interesting.
We are only 2 Weeks in to the 2021 NFL Season, and there have been some unbelievably fun Games, ridiculous Performances both Offensively and Defensively, a few upsets, and some other surprises as well!  Great job by the Ravens tonight! When they get that Offensive Line moving and playing together, they really are one of the Best in the AFC!  I have no dog in this fight, but I honestly believe both of these teams will be there right down to the End, and might even play for the AFC Championship.
Also, Ellis deserves a game ball or something for that pursuit of Kelce
NFL Pro-Tip: We called it 3 days ago Raven would win 🏆  We hope you followed our advice and took the Raven's 💰
I hate there running back so much
I will say , Lamar does look good right here and I’m a chiefs fan lol.  Lamar stepping up his game!  Good for the ravens!
What a game!
I was on Rt.1 and 95 N while the game was on. WICO/BRICK CITY I'm just now getting my game on.  PROTECT THIS HOUSE! 🖤💜💛👏👏👏👏
THE RAVENS WON?!?!? Hate when I go to sleep thinking one team got it in the bag and wake up to being wrong 😂
Chiefs D sucks and looks worse than last year. Not too optimistic about them this season.
What a game
If llamar Jackson would quit throwing into triple coverage, and really work on his passing game, and receivers work on their routes, the ravens would for sure go to the Super Bowl, they’ve got all the tools in the shed for it. Their rushing game is superb, a QB that can do both excellent like Patrick Mahomes can is a nightmare for the defense.
Lucky thats all Jackson will never beat mahomes  when it counts
Bro versus bro..I love it..Lamar Jackson beat Patricia Mahomies...it doesn't get any better than that!
watching kc lose heals the soul
10:35 , The Play That Won The Ravens The Game . 💯
This game was very exciting, I watched the game and still watching the highlights. By a show of likes, how many agree that this felt good?
I knew Lamar would get revenge
Oweh might be the hybrid Terrell Suggs we’ve been waiting for.
Coach: Calls passing play.                           Lamar: Great a running play.                        Coach: 👁👄👁.                                           Lamar: 🏃🏿‍♂️💨
So much for the 20-0 season Mahomes was talkin bout
Freaky Ls perfect moment to get ready to win the SB
As a jets fan it's great to see decent teams 🙃
That thumbnail look like he dunking lmfao
Loved Jackson save, after three picks ( especially after a pick 6) but it still came down to Mahome, not playing like Mahome.
How many yards did Mahomes throw for in this game looking at these highlights I only saw one completion over 20 yards 300 yards passing for the game but highlights show he only threw for 50 receivers ran for the other 250 but he gets credit for 300 when Brees did this at the end of his career it's called dink and dunk
Jackson greatest running quarterback ever
Its fun watching Mahomes score 30+ points just to lose  Probably need a better defense than just Matthews
I hate both of these teams it was nice to see at least one lose. Yeah I am a hater.
The season match so far
This was great game
Ravens defense really came through at the end
The Chiefs are going unbeaten this season according to the experts.
Until Lamar Gets a ring, this will be his Super Bowl. Coming from a Chiefs fan, they simply gave the ravens that game.
Wow imagine someone told u the ravens with 15 injured players would throw the chiefs 2 INTS and come out of this game with a W💪🏾Lamar got over his kryptonite in the best way 💯
Adriana Balboa  You cant win  Lamar hold my 🍺
Lamar Jackson is trash
Good football cures depression
Down so many starters and we still handed the chiefs their overdue L! What a game this should keep the Lamar haters quiet for awhile 😂
Bith teams were great, Ravens just got lucky too many times. That first td them that fumble by kc at the end.
What is this, NFL? Two trips into the Shamaylan Zone in just two weeks? Are you *that* desperate to be like Harold Ballard?
Ravens avenged us browns Respect to ravens nation     For now
The Defensive coordinator for the Chiefs has a set bias. He kept blitzing Lamar hoping and probably thinking he would fall apart in the pocket. Lesson leave your pre conceived notions at the family cookout.
One hell of a game, it was going to come down who was gonna make a play, and the Ravens did. Huge win.
So glad the ravens won. Chiefs fans haven't shut their damn mouths since they won't their first (NFL) championship. They were almost unbearable to talk about sports in general with, and the amount of bandwagoners made the 2015 Golden State Warriors look like child's play. Here's to hoping the rest of their season is like this 🍻
Can’t lie both teams went crazy 💪🏾🔥🌪
Karma worked for Jackson last week he fumbled now the other team did
Ravens have the best prime time games
Good game
feel like we been in the playoffs since week 1, the haters will have all negatives to say about this win but im proud of how Lamar kept his composer thats what impressed me the most
Let's go ravens
If we don’t up this defence I truly believe we wont win another super bowl
4 points from T. Hill killed my fantasy team.
Dam every body picked the chiefs to win this game 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂
Oweh and Jackson put this game on themselves and went all out great play by the whole team
What a great game! This is why we love football!!!
What a ridiculous amount of ads on this video
Funny how Lamar and Kyler both threw pick 6's and still ended up barely winning
Chiefs could’ve been 0-2
Only reason ravens won is cuz half the chiefs starters  is injured everyone knows that if the chiefs were full health ravens would have lost
THIS HAS BEEN A DAMN AMAZING START TO THE SEASON WTFFF
Thank you Skip Bayless
Impressive win by the ravens, lamar remainded cool. And that defense which I doubted came up big in that 4th quarter.
20-0 my asss 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Lamar runs = ravens win…..
Good, chiefs lost. Nice to see their gimmicks starting to backfire on them. Can't play street ball all the time with crazy throws and unscripted heaves without NFL defenses catching on.
What a game
Congrats Baltimore.
There were some terrible calls by the refs in this game. You have to know at this point they're trying to sway the outcome when they do that. It's blatant.
I still think that the vikings and Cardinals game was game of the week
Ravens Nation 💯💯💯
New to nfl here. These games are fire!
Ray Lewis must had “touched em” lmaooo I’m a Steelers Fan I hate the Ravens but this was a great team win by them good football 💯
I’m from Australia and I like rugby league. But watching  this bloke play has changed my whole opinion of NFL. It’s a much better game. New fan of the Ravens and NFL
Always draft lamar…Alway.
WHAT A GAME
Why mahomes int no in Highlights????
Chiefs , how do you win a game with no defense ?
I ain’t taking nothing from ravens they all banged up and they beat us  Lamar tough asf man never gives up I like that bout him but we gone see them again 💯
You get paid 450 million dollars to NOT throw up a lame duck pass under pressure lol He must have had a high school flashback or something ? Then fumble on your last drive ? Lol Pathetic Mr. Superstar...
Action Jackson finally beat its kryponite got the win for the team.  Good game Ravens!
My team defense suck we miss Ray and Ed. We'll take the win Lamar is special!
All I wanna know tho is why Lamar threw this ball at 3:14 I mean what 😅🤣
I hope one day soon Nagy either gives up playcalling or looks at the Ravens and says, "Oh, these are the plays I need for Fields, not 4 yard dump passes"
i can’t accept the fact that the chiefs lost to a team with injured starters🤦🏽‍♂️not a fan of both teams but the chiefs overrated.
Ravens… ravens …. Ravens ❤️❤️❤️🤧
It’s about time the NFL give us something to watch for instead of college roll tide by the way 🐘🐘 but this year starting off great especially for the N FL
Jackson on fire 🔥🔥
It's weird. They won this game because of/in spite of Lamar
Boys! We have a rivalry And a historically great season ahead of us
I know my bae is happy his team finally WON.❤️
On 10:36 you can clearly see statPad Kermit  Mahomes in full swing, idiotic interception!!
Stop doubting Lamar 💪🏾
AFC Championships game preview!!!!
Do u think the chiefs still think they can go 20-0?
What a game
I guess going undefeated isn't going to happen for you this season Patrick
Lmaooo muttholms taking another horrendous L
I will argue that Penn State has more historic value than U.S.C...and upmost the present value.
Ravens paying mad hard
Can't wait to here nick wrong spin this
Now this was a SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL game. Love to see Lamar lock in. Half the stars on IR against a stacked KC. Pure talent across the board.
Big win fellers sorry I didn't think you guys would pull it out Peace
I swear The ravens give me and their entire fan base heart attacks on every play
With the exception of a couple over throws. Lamar was very accurate tonight
I passed out at halftime lucky bc no way I'd have slept after this
I almost went to sleep thinking the Chiefs had it in the bag. Needless to say I’m glad I chose otherwise
The amount of adds that i had to skip through for a 14 minute video is absolutely ridicoulus
WOOOOOW...GO RAVENS💯🔥🔥🔥🔥💪
I know the media is trying hard to crown Mahomes so early but a lot of times he tries to extend plays where he shouldn’t and it results in a turnover
Good win on the Ravens. I got mad respect for the Chiefs though! Good luck to them for the remainder season! BigTruss!
Lets Go Flock Gang 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
This is one of those games you can’t be mad at! Both teams put up a good fight and it was so close that you were of the edge of your seat the whole game! Super proud of the Chiefs and Ravens!
Let me enjoy the Broncos having a better record than the chiefs for a couple weeks ok, it’s been a very long time 🥲
Lamar finally beats the golden child!!!
No words can describe this game 🔥🔥
Why 14 minutes highlights??? WTF..
Great videos
God bless
So much for the Chiefs perfect season.
God bless you
Lets go
God bless don't forget to keep God first
Lamar Jackson is a winner
Soooo scripted Collins says balls out on the Fumble nearly a second early who believes this game anymore honestly? Vegas my goodness
A FRIEND OF MINE MADE A PROFIT Of $8,000,000.  WTF😳 I'M REALLY CONVINCED HE'S DOING DRUGS 🤔.......🖕BTC
Congratulations BR awesome
BROOOO that running back sold 😭
So I see raider fans went back to their team after this game  🤫
It's crazy how much Lamar Jackson runs and doesn't get drilled without sliding.
If you hated on Lamar in any previous seasons you’re not apart of this winnnn 😂
What a game!
What a brilliant game! Jackson really was on 🔥 the whole game!
🔥🔥
Now I’m not just saying this but I think if we played the ravens 10 times then we winning 8 of them
wow fell asleep before the end haha
Ok what just happen no one talking about why she went aw
I been saying all off season that the Chiefs are obviously going to do well but will be beaten more times this years after that SB. Bucs found out how to beat them and teams are going to study that match constantly.
This Lamar best game as a QB to me 🔥
I love football
GOAT Coach. GOAT QB. GOAT Franchise.
That was 'showboating' by Jackson at 12:59.
Wow, these very mobile qbs. What if after mahomes, brady meets jackson in superbowl too.
i been a ravens fan since 98, and i can tell you OTHER THAN our 2 superbowls, and the mile high miracle, this was the most exciting win ive ever seen!
That helmet call on ravens number 70 was bs
Chiefs Defense is not very good...
1:13  James harden in the NFL wtf 🤣💯
Lamar looks like a cheap version of Danny Dimes :))
That was an amazing game to watch.
Jackson finally beat Mahomes. Love to see where this rivalry leads to
LAMAR JACKSON > PATRICK MAHOMO
That jump throw from Jackson was low-key amazing
LETS FUKCING GO LAMAR JACKSON MY GUY
Mahomes needs to stop throwing the ball when he is going down. Is stupid.
As a Titans fan who despises the Ravens, good stuff! You showed us and many other teams how to beat the Chiefs. Thank you Baltimore.
Chiefs should be 0-2
Thank God I HATE THE CHIEFS
Chiefs and Mahomes choked hahahaha
Patrick Mahomes is the NFL verison of the NBA Steph Curry,
Lamar is clutch and make his team Better Baker jus has a better team around him!
As a chiefs fan Lamar Jackson is an absolute machine
Yea Lamar !!!
As a Steelers fan and a Raven hater .I'm coming out to admit  that was impressive an win .
Lamar Jackson gotta have 4 lungs mannn LESSSS GOOOOO
Chiefs D is soft! Lite him up when he's running and he will stop.
The Browns game, Raiders game and now this game, the Ravens do NOT disappoint on primetime 👏🏾
Bro Lamar is throwing the ball to the outside now!? Dangerous
As someone who loves watching both teams i gotta say this game was fun to watch
Best NFL season ever? Certainly one of the most thrilling two rounds of football ever. 💥
Love seeing Mahomes lose.
Harbaugh asked Lamar if he wanted to go for it. At least that’s what I got from the lip reading. Just has that much trust in Lamar.
I was up 152 to 110 in fantasy around the 2nd quarter I lost by .12
Mike Terico had balls and got it right
Yo the start of this season has been amazingly crazy lol
Crazy
Watching these top teams execute drives play by play is a joy to watch
chiefs defense has been the biggest let down these past 2 games.
I can’t wait for them to play Denver should be a great game between Baltimore and the Broncos
Everybody sleeping on how the tight ends are the most effective players of the teams nowadays
Ravens did great, My chiefs need to fix up defensively and get into the right positions to receive and block.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DAMN  playoffs 😧🔥🔥🔥💯👍🏼
What's happening with my cheifs we have lead after half 35 to 24
Travis kelce turned it Alvin kamara
The face on Maholmes face in the beginning of the game , he got tht call
That means....KC will have their work cut out for them with Baltimore.
Jackson still sucks and he'll never get a ring.
Just in case all watching DON'T KNOW  .... this is a very possible SUPER BOWL MATCH UP
Outstanding first two weeks for a person new to NFL
i do not like both teams, sucks one had to win.
More like last game of the season eyy
Later your going to find out Lamar is using PED's.
Such a strange week today.
What an incredible game! Great job to the Ravens….both sides played their hearts out!!!
Chiefs should have been 0-2.
Lamar Jackson smh
Even with the refs help the cheifs couldn't win lol
Finally
Now that was a true prime time game
Lamar magic 13 injury’s can’t stop us
really clyde edwards -eilaire  just cost kansa city the game
Woooow
15 injured and beat a healthy chiefs team after a bad start.. watch when we get our players back😂😈
The Ravens saved their season with this win and Lamar finally slayed the Chiefs’ dragon. Great Win all around!
It don’t matter Lamar Jackson’s not gonna do it in the playoffs
What a gutsy win. Do people understand the magnitude of this? Nearly 20 players on IR and/or out for the week, most of them starters. Going against the best team in the conference. Going against a quarterback who had never lost in the month of September. Starting the game with two early turnovers. Nobody would have blamed the Ravens for rolling over and instead they win the damn game on a play like that. Simply incredible.
2 best qbs in the league
Go chiefs! Stupid fumble
Action Jackson strikes again
I just wish we got to see Lamar scramble more, it would’ve been really entertaining considering we know we he can do already
I can’t wait for the chiefs to be back and shut all the haters up.
Lot of 1-1 teams after week 2.
Half the games this week were nail biters that were decided by 3 points or less ... guess the nfl needed to rig the games to be more interesting after pushing most fans away with forcing their social justice garbage and left wing politics down the throats of their viewers.
Chiefs L means a good week!!!
🙏🏾✝️
When The Rock finally beats Stone Cold.
All right Ravens you win this time
I fell asleep at the half woke back up Raven's loosing 35-24 start of the 4th figured it was over I couldn't seem to stay awake in the morning wife says did you watch the game ravens won buy 1 point I thought she was pulling my leg wow they pulled it off I know Jackson is a mobile quarterback but him being the leading rusher is insane Go Ravens
Fat respect Ravens thumbs up. Go Bucs :)
These games are unbelievable
LJ's jukes are a thing of beauty.
Chiefs really should be 0-2 but browns choked but anyways congrats to Ravens
As a ravens fan this win, 2 wins over the Steelers, and the Steelers miss the playoffs I will take that and lose all other games considering the injuries
Ravens came out like they got nothing to lose, like cannon fodders facing death we got ourselves a game
Best performance of RB Jackson  😂 👏👏👏
The Ravens finally beat the Chiefs, that is no small feat, congrats to them from.a Browns fan
When everyone picking the Ravens to lose they prove you wrong No one thought with all injuries and Mahomes owned Ravens no one thought Baltimore will win and somehow they did in a crazy game despite 3 tournovers they have depth
Everybody praising Lamar yet he threw 2 int. Patrick outplayed him like he always does.
Mahomes - we’re going undefeated  Lamar hands him the L week 2 😂
As a Broncos fan, I never would've thought about the Chiefs losing to the Ravens. INSANE.
OH MY GOD!!! 8:21 🤯
More of a KC fan, but boy, that was a cool game ! WOW
Raider Fan In The House: This Was Very Close Game Gotta Give Both Teams Credit Keep Y'all Heads Up Much Love and Respect.
Both teams have garbage defenses.
that Raven RPO is devastating!!!
Is Nick Wright going to be in a good mood this morning? There goes his 20-0 season
I always wonder how much the tackling and run game would improve if NFL teams brought in rugby coaches. I'm literally watching the defenders drag the opposition over the lines for the 1st down or a TD. Its really frustrating to watch. As well as watching stupid attempts to tackle. I am enjoying the rollercoaster of no teams really standing out as playoff runners. Any given Sunday......
They should start adding stats at the end of their highlights for a few seconds it would be a nice touch
Such a good game to waste I couldn't even watch because I had school. Uggh
What a game! Chief's defence is so weak btw.
Jackson Will is what won this game.
Jackson won't ever win a SB. The guy can't make the big plays when it's needed.
Man the first two weeks of football been very exciting.
Not seeing Palumalu, ED Reed, Favre, Ladanian LT, ray Lewis, Peyton Manning is just so crazy
Thank You Baltimore!!!!
Big shout out to the Ravens guess the Chiefs are beatable all the talking head pundits who said they werent have to be sick right now. Cant wait to see all the sports shows tomorrow.
How bout dem ravens !!
The game was like a Roller Coaster - In the first half it was a back and forth contest. But during the sec half - things got real crazy . Raven took off gloves and say" Let go" I'm was surprise how well the Raven Defense holdup / even being without alot of players
ooooo My boy Lamar is on fire gooooooooo Ravens love from Serbia
So how can the Ravens score off their own fumble at the line?  thought there was a rule about that, offence can not advance a fumble?
Another year and another bad Chiefs run defense, smh.
LMAO these are pros?? Lol the NFL is nothing but NCAA nowadays...   Every quarterback thrown for over 300 yards every game yada yada yada yeah the NFL is trash
Lamar won't be going to the super bowl you can't run the ball every 3rd down there's to much speed on championship defenses
This might just be my favourite game of the season so far! And that says alot with all the fantastic game there's been
Who knew that was going to be there last score 10:17
I cant lie these games been living up to the hype !!!!
That was a good game by both teams but i feel like the cheifs should've easily won that game
would love to know how Cheifs get away with multiple facemask penalties
LET’S FREAKING GO BRONCOS!! Great game by both teams! The 2 QB’s obviously gonna be a problem for anybody. But after the first 2 games, it looks like both defenses are not that good, to put it nicely. Gaping running holes, and blown coverages with WIDE OPEN WR’s!!
Thought pat maholmes said they was goin undefeated
Chiefs 20-0 season 😂😂 LOL
Yo, the Chief's defense wearing yellow shoes & yellow gloves got me thinking there's a flag on every play 🤣
Dudes what’s with all the ads nfl
https://youtu.be/2WqAqe8VMcM 976
Lamar finally beat Patrick
Raiders sitting pretty right now!! who knew
Chiefs aren't making it to the Super Bowl this year. Teams have figured them out.
Hell yea Baltimore coming from a bills fan
Just wanna say I'm a fan from the UK and lamar jackson single handedly made me love this sport. He's better than your QB and RB take it in
Can't believe the Chiefs didn't score for the last 22 minutes (almost) :O
Steelers 4th and 1 vs. Baltimore 4th and 1
Ravens earned that victory in the trenches #RAVENSNATION💜🖤💜
This seemed like a typical Lamar performance TO multiple times, but still look good. Also you got the best QB and WR TE tandem and you risk running it? Kelce was open all night cause they was terrified of hill get a first down and knee 3 times then put in a FG or even 2 to throw em off then flip to hill to get real close or a td.
I always thought DeMarco Murray would have lasted longer than latavius murray...
Definitely Game of the week
There goes KC's perfect season... Oops
Watching Lamar Jackson play football is truly an emotional experience.
Wooooooooooooooow
Lamar a bad man.
And the dreams of an undefeated season is flushed down the toilet at the hands of Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr. WOOOOOH!
yo the nfl iis crazy rn
The Ravens are gonna get a Superbowl out of Lamar; Believe That!
Can we stop lying that Lamar Jackson isn’t a great passer ? If he’s not then why does he make great throws ? Lol
Im sorry for saying this, but that game was closer than it should have been. The interceptions were not helping. The fumble at the goal line was crazy. Even though they recovered the ball for a score. If the ravens clean some of that stuff up , they will be there in the end. Lamar makes this team go .
Chiefs honestly should’ve gotten blown out. Lamar threw two picks and missed two two point conversions, they’re lucky the ravens didn’t score almost 50
I never 🙈-saw 30 yard jump-pass in my😳 life
It's fitting that number 25 lost a fumble to lose the game for the chiefs! They need to get rid of it.
mahomes and the entire cheifs org are overrated
This nfl season is gonna be crazy!!!!
Mahomes should have just taken the sack. That was a stupid decision
Ravens came out to the infamous whistle
You can really tell the difference between Cleveland last week and the Ravens this week. The Browns don't have half the defense the Ravens do although the Browns offense is probably better. Unfortunately for the Browns their QB still screws up a the end of games.
Jackson kungfu throw!
The defense for Chiefs was terrible and the running game of Ravens deadly. KCC will not win the superbowl this year.
Jackson throws 3 ints and mahomes and company still lose. Guess he's not as superhuman as the NFL hypes him up to be.
Crazy to think The Ravens best RB is their QB lmao those other guys lack explosion
Lamar literally unstoppable with his run game if he does that every game how can they stop him. He should have did that more against raiders. Decided to throw the ball instead of running for the first on the most crucial possession in the 4th quarter
The run game was phenomenal, a little more work on Lamar's passing game and this offense will officially be unstoppable.
Credit to the Ravens to get the W what a game
Chiefs run defense is leaking this year better tighten it up are there will be no Super Bowl run
Fumbles suck. 🟥🟨
This was amazing
Lamar extention....5 years 250 million
As a Chiefs fan, this loss was bitter sweet because we had so many opportunities to win , but Baltimore never ever quit.  Amazing game today.  I hope Lamar Jackson wins a SB in his career because he absolutely deserves it.
I'm A COMEDIAN On YouTube !!!!! "Hood Justice Part 13" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥#Like #Share #Subscribe !!!!!
I’m not sure why Baltimore plays to strip the ball? Like why can’t we just make a good form tackle...
Wassup wit these ravens players/fans celebrating like they just won a super or something foh, enjoy it tho it’s gonna take ya another 4 years to beat the chiefs again
Ooo Nick Wright boutta be crying on live TV 🤣🤣🤣
What a week has it been for me and this Raven win put a cherries on the top ☺️. Have a great week everyone.
The Ravens forced a fumble and won. 2nd and 3 the Chiefs run to burn some clock and the Ravens forced a fumble and won.
The Ravens beating the Mahomes Chiefs for the first time, with significant injuries...coming off of that tough game with the Raiders...feels good. Feel real real good
Action Jackson!!!!
Electrifying
Ima browns fan & I'm tired of hearing the Lamar a RB take it's retarded af.. if he was white that wouldn't be said but just because he has better running ability than most RBs. & oh by the way can pass the ball better than some Starting QBs.. yall just hate seeing a black QB shine like the rest of the LG .. & racist ass GMs that's why he was 32nd ovr pick.. "he's too talented we don't want him" , "he's too fast so he should be a WR or RB".. He has the best of both worlds & still improving as a passer..  thankfully the Best QBs in the future & currently will seem to be all black.. Mahomes, Kyle, Dak, Russ, DeShaun, J. Fields etc. Etc. Yes they have mobility but they all can pass too. Yall cucks think all Black QBs should be RBs probably 🤣🤦🏽😭💯  especially Lamar since he's the best Runner out of ALL the QBs in the LG. Yall seem to forget he's constantly breaking & making NFL Records for his passing & running abilities .. & didn't play much his Rookie year. I just hope Baker can become elite as well
Wow
Love the looks on mahomes,kelce, and hills facial expressions when they are on the sidelines not making all the plays and about to lose
Where the Lamar Jackson haters at now ????? Shits been real quiet
Defensively, the Chiefs are not that great. Barring the honey badger their secondary is average, it just gets overshadowed by their awesome offense. Big up the Ravens for staying in the game and their defence holding up.
Chiefs defense keep this up Raiders and Carr gonna have a field day when they meet
Was the the 4th and 1 risk really worth it? It's only genius when it works out but boy had they fell short....
Brown is finally looking like what we thought he would be
M&t bank was lit 🔥
Action Jackson has done again,what a great performance
Raiders looking even better now
They might even win SUPERBOWL
Look at Lamar man. He's so inspirational.
I'm glad they lost 😂
Chiefs still gonna win Superbpwl
Dis a classic fs
What a game. I'm a phins fan but I really enjoy watching the Ravens. I hope they win it all.
WEEK 1 NOW WEEK 2  BEST SEASON EVER
Good ass game
Everytime these two team play each other its always a thriller this was game of the year!
Dam got like three and half hours of sleep for the second week in a row and have to drive a hour an a half to work then back. but we got that win In the bank.will be happy to see them play at one next week.
Nick Wrong talking about the Chiefs going undefeated.... Bwahahahaha! Great game!
Why is Mahomes the thumbnail pic when Baltimore won? Kind of misleading.
damn. straight.
We all know the only reason Ravens won was because of that fumble 🤷🏽‍♂️
#RavensFlock
9:35 🥶
Coach how do we stop Lamar Huh!!!!
Watch they still have some hate ! These shows gave us no chance ! We are bout that Lamar different plus these new guys playing with new sense of pressure I love my guyz TRU💤 💤
What a game and what a wonderful performance from Lemar Jackson. From the uk
Trash chiefs so much for going undefeated overrated  team 😴  gg ravens
Wow what a great game!!
I really love that RB named Lamar Jackson.
Great game way 2 come back ravens
TRUZZ!
This one trumps all the week-one games of the year. It's a momentum killer for the Chiefs. I didn't think Jackson can pull it off
It seems like no one want to hit mahomes or Jackson 🤔
Chiefs drafted an undersized RB in Clyde in the 1st over better backs. We were marching with ease on the last drive. Should have won.
That duvernay TD is probably the funniest heart attack I've ever had
Playoffs atmosphere!!!
Nick Wright will need to change his "20-0" tier.
turned this game off at halftime - I live in the UK. Sadge
Last week a fumble stopped the last chance attempt by the Ravens, this week it goes in their favour - football is really a strange sport.
Probs would have had that game if we didn't fumble at the end there. Ravens got a little lucky, but kudos to them for coming back after Lamar threw two picks. Getting a lead back from 7 points down against the chiefs is pretty tough, Well played ravens!
I'm sure Steve Young (Mr. Old school) will still find something wrong by Lamar. Smh!!
One of the best games I’ve ever watched
This game felt like a damn playoff game.
What a game! Action Jackson is so thrilling to watch
thy ravens. after the chiefs gifting brady a ring last year, i dont want the chiefs to be in the postseason!!!
👍 ok
Lol where’s all the people saying the chiefs are going to win this year  😂
Great game, fun to watch.
Lamar Jack = Excitement ...
Same thing that happens to the browns week one happen to Mahomes this game I guess what goes around comes around.😂😂
50 seconds in bro got his back 💯
Wow, Lamar finally beat Mahomes!
It was around the 3 minute mark that i actually wished i watched this live.
Absolutely thrilling day! And to finish it off like this is indescribable. Wow👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Jackson the mvp
#RavensNation 🗣 it was a great game yes Baltimore we beat Kansas city 💯 great way to redeem ourselves
Ay man I’m a chiefs fan but boi Lamar beating Mahomes is one of the good feelings now cuz what do the media have to say on this man
That cover photo was an INT lol
Lamar ints came from throwing into quadruple coverage smh ... Why
NFL = Rigged matrix distracts
Letssss goooo
Letssss goooo
Yeah to any Seahawks fans after today how confident in your team especially watching these teams?🤔
Without the CEH fumble, Chiefs more than likely win. Been a Chiefs fan for 34 years. Congrats to B'more.
Both mahomes and jackson just showed me they not even close to brady at playcalling 😅
YEAH LAMAR IM ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN YOU BEAT HIM THEY GIVE HIM SO MUCH HYPE WHEN HE PLAY ON A FKN ALLSTAR TEAM THROW A ROCK AND YOU HIT A PROBOLER
Lammar Jackson As Usual 🔥🔥
Great good game even a great win ravens without our key players let’s goooo
What a game indeed. Two incredible quarter backs. Ravens have had two nail biters. They should start putting the games away early
11:16 The Cover for Number 5 Ravens was off
Know why Ray Lewis is the goat? Hes such an inspiration to a team he dont have to play for the team he just shows up and we win lol
It feels good being a Ravens fan. Having Lamar finally getting his cherry popped against mahomes. 😂😂
Hard to tell who has the ball since it's the same color as his arms. Credit Harbaugh for using this to their advantage
Travis Kelce wants to be George kittle so bad
THEY SAY THESE ARE THE PROS CANT STAY ON YOUR FEET OR TACKLE AND FOR YOU NON FOOTBALL PPL OR PPL WHO THINK ITS HARD I PLAYED FOOTBALL AT 3DIFF LEVELS ITS NOT HARD AT ALL
Let's here's some super bowl predictions   I got buccaneers and Titans
NFL is fuc now back
Great game, but here's hoping Jackson gets tackled hard all the time to make him a quarterback and not a hybrid runner/quarterback. Defenses wise up and stop falling for his pump fake. Most times he well past the line of scrimmage.
This look like one of my Greatest Madden Games 🎮😂🤣🙌
Will this be Lamar's year of destiny? Let's see !
*Lamar is **#Special*
*Did i just watch the SuperBowl?*
I'm just here rooting against The Chiefs 😂 🤷🏾‍♂
"Highlights" ?! ... This is every paly that's not an incomplete pass! 15 min?!
Tua am praying for you, pls get well
I'm so happy omg action Jackson Even after the pick six to start
Who cares about the int and sacks. Lamar gonna be flipping for TD
Crazy game. Lamar throws 3 int, Pahomes with 1 int. Kinda sloppy but close game. Ironic the chiefs lose it on a fumble trying to run down the clock and in totality not trying to score too early. Such a tough problem to have, the ability to score too easy and quickly. Got hope for my raiders to at least split with KC.
Way to go Ravens! Way to knock off a titan!
Why would you take the ball out of St.Patrick mahomes hands on a potential game winning drive. I would rather lose with mahomes interception than a rb fumble. Let's get ready for the chargers next week.
🤯😳🤯😳🤯😳🤯😳🤯😳🤯😳🤯
Lamar Jackson hard carried
Dude was dishin dimes and shredding everyone everywhere all the time.. goddamn Lamar yer scary
carr must just be on a different level this year man 😂
Lamar Jackson is the best QB in the NFL
This game was so fun to watch. Great performances for both sides!
Wow that’s all
Not a ravens fan, but we just got a glimpse of lamar at his mvp level. This is what he can do on a good day
the “ineligible man downfield #70” penalty on the 2 pt conversion @ 11:15 is ridiculous!! he lunges forward to block his man who sidesteps him so he partially hits him and stumbles forward. he’s next to #66 the whole time! no effect on play.. and cost them those 2 pts.
There goes the 20-0 narrative
Fire Andy Reid
🔥🔥🔥
The ravens beat the chiefs the raiders beat the ravens… this could only mean the raider > chiefs
Bro that jump passs was elite
If #25 would have just held on to the damn ball... Good win Ravens, but we'll get em next time
Going for it on 4th only up by one is a ballsy play. Good thing it worked out for them
Coach Andy Reid will never make this mistake again. Taking the football out of Mahomes hands in crunch time
These primetime games have not disappointed. Seems like a year ago that the Bucs got that clutch drive from Brady to beat the Cowboys in the final seconds.   If only Thursday Night wasn't reserved for trash.
Literally first play before I’m actually paying attention is a pick 6 lol wtf
https://youtu.be/EuGWNHoQQIM
Gather around here all Lamar fans he was electric. The 2 weeks have been unbelievable
If only Mahomes had a defense 🤦
Instant Classic
Imagine not liking football.
watching these teams after watching giants and jets is like watching another sport
Worst highlights in all of sports.. very rushed no slow mo replay
MVP Lamar
RAVENS FLOCK ALWAYS!!!💜🖤🤍
Holy f…. What did I just watch
Jackson jukes for days…..
Feel like we’ve never seen anything like Lamar that man gonna change the nfl🔥
This is the Ravens First Win againts the chiefs after 2 years🤣
These games be having my heart on a different level
Game Of The Week🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lamar is a running back.
F the queefs
So satisfying to see the Chiefs losing a game. Also the Seahawks vs. Titans. Perfect weekend for me 🙌
at 12:55 it was too good
Lamar is the goat
It’s been only 2 weeks into the season and all the games has been 🔥.
Shows how rigged the games are . Great acting.
Good game.  Some suspect tackling by the Ravens here, though.
The Chiefs defense seems to have a some problems vs rushing. First the Browns and now the Ravens. Was also nice to see the Ravens defense picking up the pace in the second half. Nice game!
这次不到鸡鸣山绝不收兵!
None of the Chiefs fans should complain about CEH’s fumble, Oweh woulda punched that out of a vice grip dude, what a game, what a fun rivalry being built, should be a playoff matchup 😊
Chiefs not going back to the Super Bowl no time soon
That b.s call on Honey Badger changed the game
welldone Lamar!
you hear that high pitch scream out in row 68 right ?? ... that's when things are getting scary
I know people think mahones is perfect but he straight up handed this game to Baltimore, the man is clearly full of himself and thinks he's God with the stupid throws he kept trying to force all game. Pathetic.
I hope playoffs are as amazing as all these games so far
Marquise balling this season
They better show Lamar the money ❤
Thats 2 straight game of the years in 1 season now
Called it. Chiefs should be 0-2 if not for a freakish dropped punt imo. Mahomes's luck is running out.
They really put Mahomes being tackled for a 20yd loss as a thumbnail🤦‍♂️ At least put Lamar Jackson, he was the best player today
Outstanding game watching two titans battle for 60 minutes
I love how the Ravens let Lamar be Lamar and they are behind him win or lose!
11:44 wasn’t a forward pass??
Lucky fumble.   Whole world knows  Mahomes was on a game winning drive
you guys really gotta include the penalties in the highlights? lol
We Beat The Ravens In OT TWICE LOL THEN GOT TO WATCH THE RAVENS BEAT THE QUIEFS HAHAHAHA RRRRRRAAAAAAIIIIIIIDDDDDEEEEEERRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSS
NFL: Mahomes is Mr. September!  Mahomes: I'm Mr. September and the NFL will help me win since they love me!  Lamar running the 3 minute drill:
10:35 Bro we GETTIT. That worked 1 time....but ya prolly shouldn't try it every game haha
As a chief hell of a game they earned that W we will bounce back season got aways to go still our rush defense gotta step up willie g will be back for playoffs
WOW
Seeing all these random jersey numbers is throwing me off. I’m like why the QB on defense lol
What a start to this season!!
Tyran Matthew or w.e is pretty insane
The muddled foxglove bareilly clip because heat strangely scratch on a accessible tadpole. lucky, worried tax
Did the chiefs Lose 💀 I must be dreaming 😭
even though kelce scored the effort by number 71 a DT really hawked him down that guy working 10:10
Great win for the Ravens. Cheifs were too casual on the final drive. They were playing for the field goal, instead of being aggressive and scoring a TD. Ravens finally proved to themselves they can beat the Chiefs.
Mahomes was scared he has to play the raiders
THE CHEATS LOST !!!!!!! Did the money for the refs not go through or something ? Thank you Ravens for making my week, let alone my day. !!!!
Jackson deserves all the respect in the world, his performance has been nothing less than that of a MVP.
Ravens played loose and still won. Great job
That was a dope game.
Alot of mistakes made in this game from both teams this game could have went either way.
Jackson deserves all the respect in the world, his performance has been nothing less than that of a MVP.
Man I hope he can maintain this type of play and doesn't get hurt, Lamar is going to the superbowl
When you realize Tyreek Hill had 29 scrimmage yards.
Lamar Jackson is Jamarcus Russell with wheels
I don't watch NFL all the time but Lamar is my favourite player. Dude is straight entertainment
Honeybadger is a bad man
3:41 LoL
Lamar tries so hard. And then come the playoffs and he has nothing left. I don’t get it.
That game was just as epic as last Monday's game
Everything went the Chiefs way and they still bottled it. Fairweather Franchise
Let's gooooooo !!!!!!!!
ravens go at it
ngl, once brady retires I'll probably a mahomes fan. That guy is a magician...
Was at this game, was crazy and the stadium nice too, saw the city from our seats and flo rida performed it was basically a concert plus a game
🖤💜
@ 14:05
Awesome game
Can't even beat the ravens haha
At 3:04 of video, it seems the Ravens were given an extra second after play clock had gone to zero. The announcer said they "got it off," but stopping the video,  it's clear the clock is at 0.0 and the ball was still in the hands of the center for a full second longer ...
I wish KC could play that well with so many injuries. GG Ravens. What a game.
both teams are awful god what a waste of time.offensive coordinators will disappear in a few years.Mahomes is done with all those stupid flipping,and jackson is useless in the playoff
Fumbled the bagggggg
CEH cost the Chiefs the game. He’s not very good if you ask me.
Hahahaha Mar can not throw tha damn ball. What'd he have 3 passes beyond 7yrds. Good luck winning tha bowl with that technique
These ratings have to be through the roof; along of these games feel like the playoffs.
NFL lucky that Lamar stuck to his guns and remained at QB. Can you imagine how much more deadly he’d be if his sole purpose was getting even better at running than he already is? That would be unfair. He’s being generous and chose to dominate without cheating.
I guess this is bonus for enduring the year of 2020 and its season. These games have been crazy already.
Chiefs defense is low key beeen 🗑. They’re constantly bailed out by Pat. I mean I get it you payed your whole offens hundreds of millions but this just isn’t a championship team to me. Not when you got a team like the bucs around
Can we talk about how fast this lineman reflexes were @10:05
Action Jackson killed them. Good to see the Ravens with a strong running game. It would be great if they had another star receiver to compliment Hollywood.
I feel so bad for clyde bruh that fumble gonna be on his mind the whole season
This was such a great game to watch, always fun to see the underdog win. Nothing against the Chiefs but dynasties are boring in my opinion. I love to watch Mahomes play but I really don’t want to watch the same team winning for the next 20 years again
unbelievable game uncle Shay going to be pleased on the inside
Beautiful day when Chiefs lose
Hell fkn yeaahhhaaaa!!! LesssGo Ravens!!!
TIENE QUE TRABAJAR LA DEFENSA DE KANSAS CITY POR QUE SIGUE SIENDO UN PROBLEMA Y UN DESMADRE ❤️💯🏈🏟️🇲🇽🍻🖤
Action Jackson
The Chiefs Defense looking sus as usual
12:02 Come on mahomes you’re better than that
Chiefs defense is not good this season. But I don't worry. Two years ago, Chiefs won Superbowl even with such a bad defense.
Action Jacksonnnnn 🔥🔥🔥✅✅✅✅
0:56 Right Place, Right Time
/ourRavens/
Lamar gotta clean up those Ints.....other than that solid win
Lamar played like MVP Lamar but with better defence read, he didnt use any of the new things he learned this off season though like that rainbow pass he used last game which was sad to see cause that would have opened the field for him to score and run easier but forcing cover to fall back more... Mahomes lost it for KC when he had the chance to close the game, Ravens coach needs to work on his plays, if not for Lamar getting so good a faking handoffs and passes this could have easily been a blowout for KC... but the Ravens coach did the right thing at the end and bet the game on his QB and asked his opinion that was great leadership which i believe has a ton of since started following Ravens they looked like the most united team in the league second only to that Tom Brady Bucs team but like KC they are united by winning while Raven look more like a "family" - Dom
Not much defense being played in the secondary of either team.
AT THE END OF THE LAMAR  JACKSON  HE IS A ELITE  QUARTERBACK  .YES LAMAR  JACKSON  THREW 2 INTERCEPTIONS  OK PAT MAHOMES THREW A INTERCEPTION  TO . HATE LAMAR JACKSON  ALL YOU WANT. AT  THE END OF THE DAY LAMAR PROVES HIS HATERS WRONG . IT WAS A GOOD  GAME. CHIEF'S  FANS OR LAMAR HATERS  YOU HAVE TO GIVE LAMAR JACKSON  HIS RESPECT. HE TOOK THE TEAM ON HIS BACK  AND WON. LAMAR  IS SPECIAL HE COMPETES JUST LIKE MAHOMES .LAMAR BEAT MAHOMES. NO EXCUSES.  CHIEFS FANS HAVE  TO STOP BEING  SORE LOSERS..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why did the chiefs throw away Sammy Watkins? 😂😂 biggest mistake
I just came here to watch how people blame everyone but Mahomes for this
Mahomes will never win another super bowl.
Great game! We must build on this win. This wasn't easy, and at times we looked shaky. But we pulled it together when it counted. O Line played better, corners defended Hill outstandingly. Lamar balled out when it counted, but my man gotta tighten up a little. A couple passes were off target that could've been prevented. Hats off to the Chiefs on a good game. See you guys again. All in all, great W Flock!!
Thanks Ravens for returning the favor. Raiders!
How y’all liking  these scripted games so far
What a game !!!! Lamar Vs Defense. !!!!
Every team and players now know the importance of protecting their QB and do his job!  Every game is fantastically thrilling!
Hell yeah Ravens. Lamar looked decent except for his passes to the badger
KC is severely overrated
That jump pass tho. Like a James Worthy finger roll. Sweetness!!
Kelce earned his NFL rank
Good defensive game.😁
Oooooo these games are 🔥 now allow me to throw some salt in here. As I good of a game this was, chiefs and mahomes ain’t not Brady. Was his time to make that two min drive against a formidable team. Anyways this season is going to be pretty fun 🍻
That was a wild game
As I said save the best for last. Definitely a full 2 weeks of good entertainment 😩👌
My team finally beat the chiefs in the new era 😤👊🏼
So basically Mahomes has to be perfect every time for the Chiefs to win a game.
LAMAR!!!! JACKSON!!!!
Great game Raven played hard , I feel tgey tried to cheat a couple times but y'all with stood that n came away with the W. Jacksons a BEAST
HAS MAHOMES BEEN FIGURED OUT? His style is not sustainable.
Nick Wright will be so mad😂😂
As i predicted in my post comment😊 Ravens win!!!  Congrats Baltimore!!!
UN-REAL GAME
KC fumbled this game away
Rave on
Chiefs defense is scary bad vs the run.
so many of these plays are *not* highlight material actually
😳is Holms reign over, and LJ start? Tom B: who cares Til I leave 🤣🤣🤣(goat)
These past 14 days of football have been phenomenal. There hasn’t been a bad game in primetime anywhere.
This has been an AMAZING start to the football season!!! Great games all week long in both weeks so far!
Ha ha ha ha K,C You can be Beat.  Way to go Lamar Jackson
Everyone’s finding out ways to compete with kc this year.
Lamar has it, unquantifiable
Lamar Jackson is ridiculous!
Such a wild game for Lamar and the Baltimore Ravens, congrats!
show the Jackson Mahomo highlight
Ravens not even my team and I’m happy 😂
Hell of a game Jackson is hard to stop
Cheifs ate dirt 😂😂 but this was a good game
Man I’m watching this after already watching the game and I’m just as excited as I was the first time. Absolutely bonkers win.
Def one of the finer games played this week
Let’s go ravens
I love how john  treats lamar like his own son god i love football
lucky
Now I hope yall all see the Chiefs are not better than the Raiders and split the series between the two last year💯
Darn do I want Mr. Odafe Oweh to be a Ravens lifer...
Got to say best performance I’ve seen by a quarter back this season   Lamar Jackson was all over the place  great throws/passes great runs great hand off and fakes.   We beat them last week but damn they a whole different team from last week
Wow. That jump pass from Lamar was class. Absolutely class.
critcal errors from chiefs
Let’s go !!!! Lamar and the boys are doing it
Congratulations to Michael Vick jr🥰 he took over the game 👍 aka Jackson
What a fucken game
#1 & #2 RB's go down...no problem guy's, we have an amazing offensive line
My fantasy opponent and I were tied going into this game. I had Mahomes, and he had Lamar. I lost lol
Lamar Jackson needs to be careful with all that rushing, could lead to a major injury 🤕 would not want that because I'm starting to like this kid
https://youtu.be/qENt_QKiVTI
what an amazing game - Jackson is really lighting up - what amazing plays from Both QB
To throw 2 interceptions and still beat the Chiefs is very impressive.
I was at the game . Environment was awesome 😎 greatest game I’ve ever been to.
Lamar's arm talent is underrated, he can do it all.
First things First in the morning fasho
Kansas City chiefs have Seattle Seahawks written all over them. Dominated the nfl for 3-5 years, but they were only able to win one super bowl.
This was as close as watching the ` Harlem Globetrotters vrs the Harlem Globetrotters on a football field as you can get.
What an OUTSTANDING first 2 weeks!!!!!
LJ the best RB in the NFL
Showing a false start, or holding penalty is not a highlight so plz stop showing that….
Ravens in prime time never disappoints. I’m sure lamar gaining fans left and right with this performance tonight
Can someone explain to me the illegal formation penalty ?
Both defenses are bad!
Mahomes the best throwing going sideways. Murray the best throwing moving forward. Jackson the best throwing while jumping.
That 40+ yard flick seemed so easy
Lamar with an amazing game. Coach forcing two points attempts could have costed them, defense stepped up in the end.
My gosh these games have been awesome and it's only going into Week 3!   Side note: Why am I seeing QB's playing on offense and defense?
Is Edwards-Helaire even that good? I thought he was, but he only had a few good games last season, and he's started this season off very poorly. Maybe they just need to involve him a bit more, throw him some more dump off's and check-downs, idk
He made some dumb mistakes, but his greatness overcame it, and I still think he's a better passer just was rushing too much. He needs to have a bit more patience Idk why we have people hating saying he's not a QB he's a running back. It's one game he made a few mistakes. Stop overreacting to one game and wait till the season is over before you judge like damn
How many of you "men" out there realize that our elections are a fraud, the virus is a scam and that your children's and grand children's futures are being systematically destroyed?
Chifes got destroyed
Edward  funa have to start selling cars cause he fumbles every game
Did LJ backflip rushing TD reminds you of Hill's backflip last year?
OMG I can't get enough of that fumble. Odafe Oweh will be a name to remember!
3:56 No that makes it 3rd down ref did you not watch that Penn State vs Auburn game Saturday.
Smoking on  chief pact
8:18 Lamar literally jukes 4 people in a row like its madden 22
i was at the game, my first ravens game ever. electric and best sunday night game ive ever seen
False start on the right tackle on ravens last TD
Lamar is hungry!!!
Chiefs Kingdom still reigning. I’m not worried about Ravens. I’m more worried about the Raiders, Chargers & Denver.
Mahomes talking about going undefeated😂😂🤣
THIS GAME WAS A CLASSIC
Lamar can't throw the ball that's why he has to run he is not a quarterback
Chiefs OL still needs work. Chiefs CANT stop the run and need a  Saquon Barkley-esque RB and need to properly coach their defensive players how to do wrap-up tackles if they expect to win the AFC
nobody can say that was mahomes fault
The Thumbnail explains its all how Chiefs went... why...
Watching from Australia. Can't believe how many really exciting games there have been already. These guys must be makin' up for Covid or somethin'.
🎵🎵🎵🎵The KC fluke is over🎵🎵🎵🎵
🎶GO LAMAHH GO LAMAHH 🎶
LOVE HOW WHEN U HAVE A FULL BLOOD BLUEGUM AT qb ALL THEY CAN DO IS RUN THE BALL
Chiefs continuously just choke it's kind of embarrassing when you're a "god" team
Lamar is too nice with running that ball like that. Please don’t get hurt tho 🙏🏽
The Chiefs' defense is ruining Mahomes.
0:00 When you failed the exam once 14:10 When you passed the exam on the next attempt and get an A+
I'm tired of hearing about Mahomes. He gets way more credit than he deserves. Those receivers he always has around him are always open, the line is always a wall, and the yards after the catch are insane. Put him on the Jets and let's see his numbers. Great player but far over rated.
As a Browns fan this makes me feel weird.. of course I'm more concerned with our own division so I was leaning towards the Chiefs to win but seeing them lose does put a smile on my face.. Lamar just showed how to overcome adversity and beat an elite team.
I hate the Ravens but I gotta gut feeling that they are going to be dangerous again this year. That team can be lethal and their QB is insane. If they get on a winning stream, they will literally destroy everyone.
good.
I'm confused who is going undefeated this year Patrick Mahomeless sure as hell not you a promise you couldn't keep. 😄😄😄
What a game it was. I was shocked that KC blew an eleven point lead in the fourth quarter and allowed the Ravens to score 12 unanswered points and win this game. That fumble they forced was the icing on the cake. It is Mahomes first loss in September as a starter too.
Lamar is not a quarterback he is a running quarterback he is going to get injured you will see
Chiefs Defense has to get their act together because this looking like 2018 Chiefs Defense all over again, Mahomes and the offense have to put up 30 plus point each week to win.
AFC North is now officially the strongest division in football.
CHEIFS ARE TRASH 🗑
3:19 #14 has absolutely no interest in playing football
I thought for sure Ravens were taking an L. That fumble saved em.
NFL thank you im a lebron fan and im glad these sport shows have something else to talk about ...
The balls on John Harbaugh, we’ll played well played
When you want the Raven to win and have Kelce in your fantasy line up while playing against Tyreek Hill and Mark Andrews.
The Chiefs are incapable of having a dull game dude.
So much for the perfect season.  Nick Wrong is on suicide watch.
Thanks, Ravens! -Raiders fan
if lamar develops his pocket passing that boy is going to be a problem. but so many errors when he is there interceptions,over thrown balls or fumbles lmaoo too much be happening

Ravens had 15 guys on IR, had Watkins fall down on a play resulting in a pick 6, had a terrible penalty go against them on a 2 point conversion, and the Chiefs were entirely healthy. .."
Let’s go!!!!
Lamar 🔥🔥 so proud of him. The way the franchise has changed their entire offense for him and his strengths is beautiful.
We see you Lamar…. Packers fans. Much respect
Wish all games were like this
Entire AFC north is tied
Thank you RAVENS!!
That last td was an offsides.
if only lamar had some of these weapons
Put respect on Lamar Jackson name
Saw a lot of people making fun of Baltimore's preseason streak coming into the regular season. What their streak tells me is that they have unbelievable depth behind their starters and great coaching. And now it's showing. Obviously we haven't played the best ball the first two weeks, but considering the amount of starters missing, the fact that the Ravens are even able to be in a ball game like this is testament of how deep they are. This team would be scary at full health this season.
Cant wait to hear Chris go in on Nick Wright Lol
Jackson won't have a long career if he keeps running the football... All it takes is just one hit in the right place.
Incredible timing of turnovers becoming recovered in critical moments of so many games.
Not a fan of any of these two teams but I was rooting for the Ravens since everyone had ruled them out on having even a sliver of a chance at winning this game. And I am really glad they pulled it off and won it.
some pair of quarterbacks . unique talents both
So raiders might be dangerous
RAVENS NATION STAND ☝!.... GO RAVENS!
How is NOBODY talking about that jump over the defensive line throw at 9:35 😲😲😲 LJ is that DUDE!
Good stuff
Game of the week for sure.
they deserve it after halfway they were the better team
Yall lamars shoulders are tired and it's game 2 ravens D better step it up
Mahomes needs to stop running and running before letting go of the pass. Their offense is just stale for some reason since last playoffs. Somethings off
Dayum, many teams went 1-1 in week 2
No entiendo porqué Lamar no quiso correr desde el principio, pero, al final, y con ayuda de la defensiva, le ganó a un equipo contendiente al súper tazón.  Los últimos 4 minutos estuvieron de lujo.
Hahaha.....Lamar is MVP!!!
tavon young almost had 2 picks. dudes presence is huge
Let’s go Ravens 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🦍🦍🦍🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥💜💜💜
Terrible calls by the refs in a lot of games this weekend, especially this one. Ravens could have lost this due to a few really bad calls.
Jackson threw some ugly ones, but he certainly made up for it. Man, what a game!
Before the season, what if I had told you that the only undefeated team in the AFC after two week would be that Raiders and the Broncos?
It's all rig.... tonight all Vegas bet was on hill and they made sure he only got 14 yards total....
Even with the refs help the cheifs still didn't win 😂
That was a great game but Baltimore defense was playing like they don't want to win
Lamar Jackson = VIBRAINIUM QB 🏃.....I told y'all this a LONG TIME AGO.   Do you BELIEVE me now.... 😉
Great game but can we speak on the 3 big phantom calls. Especially the one called on Matheus, that really swung the game. I truly suggest the nfl look into hiring younger refs.
Black player go through to much you have to be mentally strong to make it
T.O. Is a Hall of Famer sure he still got it
They won but you can't say lamar was better than mahomes. He led his team down the field for the game winner and his running back coughed up the football. Can't blame mahomes but ravens won so no excuses, moving on too week 3 after packers vs lions
As a broncos fan who moved to KC a few years back, this game has brought me great joy. Cant wait to go to work tomorrow LMAO
Wow every year Lamar does something he had trouble doing the year before.  First it was a play off win, then getting past the Titans, now beating the Chiefs!  Just gotta get them dam 🐃's back and we in there
This was one of the best football games I've ever seen
Insane game! I had under 73 1/2 lol!
10:00 shoutout to the big dude for not giving up on the play
Damn if Lamar cleans up his TO's, they going to be scary.  Glad they got a fumble back for last week.  Crazy games so far
when Lamar's on point hes the most exciting QB to watch
Lamars jukes are even more advanced.
edwards-helaire aint gonna have i good sleep tonight.
The Raiders really are good this year. They won vs the Ravens that won against the Chiefs and against the Steelers who won against the Bills who just destroyed the Dolphins. Stop underrating them!
That first slip looked too easy.
Every chiefs fan before the game 😂😂😂 Every chiefs fan after the game 😳 Lmao y’all the bid
5:32 bro how is there an illegal formation?
Raiders are 2-0 and beat these Ravens. How long before they collapse? Or is the Silver and Black back?
This is the outcome many wanted to see but few actually expected. So happy for Lamar, getting his first win over Kansas City!
Two average defenses just trying to hold on for dear life.
Robinsons touch down shouldnt be one cause he didnt have control of it till he was out
L
Damn that Thumbnail lit! 🔥 Looks like it’s going to be a battle
I feel like most Ravens prime time games are extremely thrilling. Steelers, Browns, Chiefs, Patriots, etc.
*Amazing game from the two best quarterbacks in the league!*
nice job ravens and lamar. the man is persistent and that’ll be what gets him a Super Bowl.
Tackling is embarrassingly bad.
Who would have guessed the Chiefs would sit at #3 in their division after Week 2? Crazy season so far!
jeez ravens have freeman and murray wtf
This was Lamar Jackson playing with confidence in his ability. That boi has that little jab juke step down. The PREDATOR!
Needed Chiefs win after all the other legs of my bet had already been ticked. I thought the certain field goal attempt would get me there... Safe to say I wasn’t a big fan of CEH by the end of the game...😑
Ravens came through in the clutch!!
Phenomenal
Big dub by Titans 😩
Did not expect that. And as always when watching these, don't look at the comments, don't look at the comments. :-)
Aside from the 3int, Lamar has gotten significantly better at throwing since his first start.
Is there any other team that asks more from one player then the Ravens do from Lamar? Amazing he is!
Very impressive that the Ravens don't even need a Quarterback to win especially against a really good team
Only 7 undefeated team currently, I think the Raiders will have the best record this year 🏆
Not a Ravens fan but honestly I’m happy for Lamar
Not only have the prime time games been electrifyingly close and competitive, but the season itself is off to an amazing start! Feels like playoff season already!
Watching two hyper offense teams is such a snoozefest
My ravens🔥
Raiders and Broncos fans must be ecstatic right now
Great speed and jerky misdirecting
Odds that Jackson and his stick-like figure won't get injured doing any of these very fast and razor-thin Neo dodges around 300+ pound linemen?
Lamar needs some damn help!!! And that was some pathetic tackling by the defense of the Ravens
Jackson may have started with a Pick-6, but he had some incredible moments that led the Ravens to victory tonight. Just goes to show you that however good the Chiefs may appear, all teams are beatable
Lamar finally overcame his kryptonite nemesis, but he subjected himself to an awful lot of punishment in the process. He needs to consider how that went for RG3 and Cam Newton. Like your QB doing a cartwheel flip into the end zone was ....???!!!!
ALL I CAN SAY IS…. WHAT.. A…GAME!!
Lamar so fustrating, cuz one moment he goes super saiyan god mode, but next, he looks like the Tampa version of Jameis Winston. Giving you Raven fans heart attacks each week
LJ was on demon time in the 2nd half, MVP
Travis keelce td WOW😲
Hey 👋 Orlando Brown jr 🤣
Glad the chiefs lost 🤣Go raiders !!
Such a thrill to watch this live! Mahomes' interception really turned the tide. That fumble at the end had me shouting!
I wonder if all those Trumpers who vowed never to watch another NFL game know what they're missing.
It’s a wonderful day! Hard to imagine giving up 3 interceptions to the Chiefs and still winning!
Great game! Wow.. The ravens need to tackle better though
Both teams looked great. Ravens were better today. 👍👍
I was at this game. I’ve never seen it that crazy before
Lamar Reminds Me Of A Prime Kapernick But Quicker.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Ravens have had 2 Hollywood games in 2 weeks
y’all talking abt lamar let’s talk abt playoff lamar 🤣🤣what super bowl has he won?🤣
Bout time the ravens learn not to blitz mahomes dats all they use to do 😂
Baltimore oughtta do the Omar whistle to start every game. RIP Michael K. Williams.
Glad to see the cocky Chiefs get pegged down a little.
Losing sucks but I say this with complete sincerity; respect. You give Mahomes the ball and we win it and you said "No. I trust my guy." Good, hardnosed football. Respect.
Edwards Helaire is such garbage
That was the best game today! , the Ravens really looked good out there today!, and the Chiefs as usual.
Seat geek commercials are terrible
omg Lamar is a beast!!
And just like in madden 22 Lamar is a problem 😤
lamar is such a smooth runner... maybe on of the best ever. too bad i cant throw a lick
What a game!
I feel like people put so much pressure on lamar because hes a black QB hes doing just fine and hes only getting better with more experience
I'm still going through my head of how we won when we were down 11 points 2 times in the 2nd half.  That turnover by Mahomes was massive
Give credit to the rookie Oweh , he played a master game
What Else they going say about Lamar??? .... ( Seriously, I Want Answers)
OWEH the truth!
Holy Sh**, what a game!
17-0 whut?
At 12:57 The Chiefs defense got bamboozled
I am your nabor...i am your soul. Follow me out this hole.
I’m smelling a rematch
I think some of these guys forgot how to tackle 🤷🏽‍♂️
I don't think chiefs are getting to the superbowl this year. Sorry not sorry
Another great game.
fatrick "diaper boy" mahomo stays overrated
This is going to be a interesting season.
Mahomes vs Jackson is this generations Brady vs Manning.
I haven’t seen devonta freeman in a minute
Not really watched a boring game yet. Well done all teams.
In NFL whatever happens, never be astonished in 4th quarter
I'm cowboys fan but Great NFL Game!!
Man DAMN!!! How do you have 15 ads in a 14 minute video! 😡
Dear god now i lay me down to sleep thank utube for the posts they allowed me to keep.. if i die before i wake i pray to tech gods my posts dont take.
shitty run defense for both teams
False starts are not highlights.
I was rooting for the ravens but I feel they got lucky with this win, a rematch will not be the same results. Kc I’s just too good
I’m calling it now Best game of the season💪
Best start of an NFL season in recent memory.
Baltimore needs every play to beat KC until the end of game.
Everybody saying Mahomes lost because his teammate fumbled but KC got a pick and 7 points because Sammy Watkins slipped… excluding that not only is the margin larger but Lamar and Mahomes then have the same number of picks. And only one of them has half their team injured and a HS o line. I think PM is the best in the league rn, but the amount of people rationalizing avoiding crediting LJ8 is wild
Helluva great game!
Ballsy call on the 4th and 1 at the end of game. Ravens earned that victory..what a game
lamar and the ravens played to win. nice job
Mahomes turnover cost K.C. and it changed the momentum, but I bet on K . C over Baltimore every time. Baltimore only has Lamar Jackson and you can't win  a championship that way.  KC will be in the Superbowl.
Michael Vick?? No Lamar Jackson. He might as play both position as a Qb and Rb at the Same time
8:18
The ads bro are mad annoying
As a chiefs fan we will bounce back just part of the game win a lot lose some can’t win them all good luck rest of the season ravens fans
He may have still been a little sloppy, but you could tell how much Jackson wanted this win after last week
Kudos to Harbaugh for giving LJ the decision on that 4th down.
Ravens offense honestly looked great. Only real bad play is the second INT. Passing game was smooth whenever they had to pass. Running game wasn’t able to be stopped, just the next man up. Defense has to step up, some good drives some bad. Onto the next let’s go BMore.
Ravens need some big guys upfront chief guys where much bigger which gave mahomes alot of protection
Damn. Alot of underdogs have been giving the best games so far. Even the raiders somehow , I hope the packers can give us a best season to
This game literally proves Lamar's a better running back lol. Threw 3 interceptions and his best plays were on his runs. Good game tho
You got to give Lamar his credit🔥🏈🥇
The Chiefs LBs and Secondary are so bad (again) this year far. I really wish they could have addressed the defense more in the off season but they had to spend a lot to get the Offensive line together for Mahomes after that Superbowl implosion... Talk about a rock and a hard place
I have been saying this since last year and sticking to it CEH, Nieman, and Sorenson needs to go!!
Definitely " WHAT A GAME " 👍🏾
Kansas D is flawed they can't stop a run game only passing !
Football is on a whole new level these days, everybody is a star coming out the gate. It’s no longer just a bunch of old men blowing each other’s heads off. It’s young guys with finesse and real calculated talent. Football is on another level.
4:07 Oweh got OBJ shook!
Love to see the chiefs loose
Lamar finally beat the chiefs. Celebration was a lot work paying off
KC really needs a big back that can carry the ball downhill (and not fumble). If we had a big back to help Mahomes shoulder the load (and block when needed) the fact that our defense being as awful as it is wouldn't be such a factor. Helaire is not the guy.
17 players on the IR and you play like that , can you imagine healthy ravens what they can do
Just imagine that your QB is your best RB on the team…that must hurt😭😭😭
Who would have thought it would be the Raiders and Broncos on top of the AFC West at 2-0 each after the first two weeks?
The game could have been more one sided for the Ravens if they didn't suffer so many turnovers and miss extra points.
So how good does this make the raiders lol
Chiefs suck!!!!!
I was at this game. Even chief fans left the stadium smiling. Great game
The hapless gum thermodynamically bare because wealth mostly battle notwithstanding a puzzled pvc. tearful, cut wallaby
This was a real football game!
Nice one Lamar let's gooo
If anyone don’t think the NFL ain’t rigged this game is actually proof, think 🤔 about it the ravens lost on  Monday night football 🏈 overtime lost to the raiders on the road then come back to beat the chiefs without any other Their running backs an two missing CBs think 🤔 about this then the chiefs up by 9 fail to get a score or anything an then they need a field goal in are running it ? Oh another one how about the Steelers beating Buffalo then losing to the raiders at home ? Think about this guys
Lamar is definitely the most fun QB to watch, like you literally never know if he is going to run or throw
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
To go for it on 4 th down with one minute left that’s the best decision ever made by John harbaugh, I won’t be disappointed if we don’t make the first game .. you can’t give the ball to mahomes hands with 1 minute left
Derrick  Henry plays for the ravens to
Knee down?  Is it not called a victory formation?
always love it to see the Queefs lose!
Another fantastic game. Two wonderful teams.
First ten seconds shows why Lamar isn't a linebacker.
Man, this season gonna be greaatt
💥💥 This game actually shouldn't have been that close. I mean Lamar Jackson threw a pick 6 and threw a pick in the end zone and the Ravens defense Missed a ton of tackles. In fact some of the tackles they were missing on defense was just absolutely pathetic.
Agreed he still needs to take the next step in his development to go deep into the playoffs. But can we please stop with the "league has figured him out" nonsense?
For all the injuries the Ravens have faced just in the last 2 weeks, this is a huge win. I think a real statement game for Jackson and the Ravens!
Jackson and the Ravens muster  game coming from behind to defeat the Chiefs.....
Congrats to my resilient Ravens. Ravens overcame adversity. Chiefs are a great, legendary team. Mahomes is like Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers on steroids heck of a player and team those Chiefs are. I had a feeling Bmore had a chance after losing to the Raiders on the road who also beat Pitt today which is nice.
I back Mahomes, it was a flook.
Yessirr 2 - 0
Lamar Jackson trying to throw a deep pass and gets picked: Well i guess that spot will be there tomorrow i think i better just keep walking. Throws a second pick to the same guy: Running better start running running running!! Scores a rushing TD and is one score away from the lead: SPRINTING YES!! I JUST GOTTA KEEP SPRINTING!!!! Lamar Jackson after winning the game: Sitting sitting bleeding...
Are these highlights sped up????? Watch the clock it’s definitely sped up
Best game so far. Hoping more games like this
Tampa native, but die hard Ravens fan and this was a big win for us with so many injuries.
I know for a fact that Lamar Jackson cannot read defenses, he's talented as all get out........but he's out there "Guessing Right Now".......he ain't Winning No Super Bowl Playing Like This.........#Facts
I'm a Niners fan and I have no love for the Ravens, but Lamar is one of my favorite players in the game. Baltimore got themselves a great
I’m so glad i get to hear nick wright whine and moan tomorrow about his chiefs losing and how they were going to be 20-0
People always get hyped by the Ravens and LJ at the beginning of the season and chill down when the postseason is coming.
Right when I saw the thumbnail first thing I thought was "ain't no way boy"
Let's be real the chiefs gave this one away
DAMN.......I wanted to see this game......I'm sick right now lol.....this was one for the ages
Damn Game of the year already lol
This was just the next step to the Chief to win this season :P
Game of the year!!!! CHANGE MY MIND!!!
Chiefs are lucky they’re not 0-2
NFL Defensive Coaches: 2021/22 is the year we gonna figure out Lamar LJ: I strongly doubt that
Game of the year
Well was a good game , looked like the chiefs were setting up for the walk off field goal win.....then the fumble....oh well Sh*t happens....on to the next game .....
Ravens fans suffered heart attacks the past two weeks. Crazy.
Grat game, Im glad Baltimore won.  They could scored more points if it Lamar hadn't thrown the intersections.
Hell yeah!! Ravens get the Win
Lamar went from -1.68 fantasy pts to 32 😩 saved my team
I see you Jackson... that desire to win. 🔥🥊🥊
As a pats fan.... YES!!!!
Why does the referee looks like Big Ben🤦🏾‍♂️
For about the 5th or 6th time this year,a late turnover cost a team a win.LJ really wanted this win,great game.
Lets go Ravens. What a game by both sides. These opening games are just awsome!!
LETS GOOOOOOO
Bout damn time!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I hate that people saying Mahomes had no defense, that’s what happens when you focus so heavily on the offensive side of the ball. Plus, mahomes urged for a whole new line, and that’s what they spent their money and picks on.
Let’s Go Lamar hopefully we get the Super Bowl
Raven running game even better!
Anybody ever think the sound of the crowd is fake?
Poor Lamar, He plays in the worst defense team in NFL LoL....
Lamar is not a qb
These first two weeks of the NFL season have been so good to watch but bad for my heart
I can’t believe my Chiefs blew it.
That bogus call on Honey Badger that negated the sack was the turning point. You can't give a team like the Ravens more opportunities. The officiating has been all-time bad this season.
Lamar Jackson is straight 🔥🔥
No way Jose
I swear this was my wild card
I thought the ravens was going to lose another close game but I'm glad they pull it off go ravens go ravens. This nfl season is exciting to watch it's like a playoff game.
Chiefs blew it with that late fumble.  Actually they blew it earlier by giving up leads.  Should never have been close.
I wish the Steelers would get rid of our old pass-of-gas and get one of these young guns 😒🙄
I have to ask this stupid question, can Lamar Jackson throw? Lol
Vegas:  So who would have placed a bet that the RAIDERS would have a better record than the Chiefs at any point in this season?
That pour judgement throw coast KC the game
My Grandfather who was a huge Ravens fan and inspired me to be a Ravens Fan passed away Friday… he would of been so proud of his Ravens. I miss him so much but so happy his team won on the week of his death. Crying tears of joy tonight.
1:12 Is that James Harden?
Please don't bash the Black QB this week his team one the game he came through during the clutch he was consistent all game... So please for one week don't bash the Black QB
Gg raven fans
Raiders and Ravens fans rn 🤝
What happened to Le'Veon Bell?? am I missing something?
The L was handed to Baltimore in the first minute, and they still won
That pick Mahomes threw intended for Kelsey was a game changer.
Lost to a better Qb.
Most coaches would have punted at the end and lost.
First off I am not a fan of either team and I don't have any skin in this game at all.. Also I'm not one of those guys who comes out and blames the refs or thinks that there's some kind of officiating conspiracies but I have to tell you this was one of those games that gets you scratching your head.. This game was not called right down the middle and it's a miracle the Ravens won this game having to play against 2 opponents.. Horrible officiating..
Don't abandon the DESIGNED runs. Not scrambles that start as dropbacks but end in turnovers because this line isn't but for pass pro. A steady diet of designed runs opens up the passing game.
Great game! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
MAHOMES is out of this 🌎🌍🌎🌍🌎🌍both teams ALL THESE 🔫🔪🔫🔪🔫🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔫🔫🔫 WEAPONS Jackson 2 elusive ever
Wow the Raiders are the number one team in the AFC West
Lamar Jackson the QB who still wants to be a Running Back
Boy o boy let’s go Ravens incredible game, what a team we have this year, Lamar is going to be better and better, every single game. Love from Italy
As a steelers fan good Job to the radars they've beat us fair and square no hate respect  and  this session is just neck to neck games awesome session so far
Thats two weeks of a RB fumbling the game away for team. New England Patriots last week  Kansas City Chiefs this week.
Hollywoods false start????
Lol the refs tried sabotaging this game too?
Manning vs Brady ebony edition
Edwards-Helaire threw the game away, but you have to tip your hat to Lamar Jackson. What a game from him; put his team on his back after those two INTs and never looked back. Amazing stuff
The Ravens just had two amazing games in a row
Im just glad all the “experts” that thought the chiefs would go undefeated are currently silenced….
These games have been close nowadays. Damn! i thought my job was hard but I have to think again.
Positive Vibes
John harbaugh and Lamar’s relationship is something Rodgers wished he could’ve have
Fumble
What a game. This season has been good
Idk anything about American football but saw the whole ngl it was kinda fire
Unreal
The hollow acknowledgment optimally shave because window postsynaptically peck given a melodic probation. judicious, gaudy transport
9:38 If that was mahomes w
Mahomes always pulls through in the critical moments.  But his team always screwing him over.
i love you lmar jcson
Best the NFL has to offer with my favorite Al Michaels and the best competing Offenses and Defenses. Surprised the Chiefs came up short. The Ravens game plan was well executed. Let Lamar be Lamar. It was clean and a proper NFL presentation of excellence. Well done. Great Game.
Nick Wright officially on suicide watch after this one 😂
Bruh im a cardinals fan and my best friend is a chiefs fan and i was saying the cardinals are gonna win the super bowl and she said not if they only winning by 1 point cuz they won 34-33 today then she said sum about how would u feel if ur team lost by 1 point and i said id prolly cry and then said the chiefs gonna lose tonight tho and she said well if they do at least it wont be by 1 point that its so close it hurts and then i saw the final score lmao
Still not figured out I guess 🤷🏿‍♂️
Aahhh such a good feeling when that team loses 😌 sleeping like a babie tonight.
Game of the year
Can anyone tell me why duvernay’s touchdown doesn’t show up on a stat sheet? I couldn’t find anything about the touchdown that he got and I was wondering why that was.
Im not a Raven's fan but FINALLY they w vs kc
Mahones costed the chiefs the W
Wow, now that's some great football on both sides of the ball from both teams!
holy crap
If Chiefs was a NFC and Ravens were still AFC and both of these teams made it to the playoffs. I don't know what I'll say.
Wow! What a great game!
Them Raiders are looking reallly good now!!! RAIDERNATION
Omg NFL is back
Ravens a beast with rpo. Cheifs couldnt figure it out cuz lamar too nice wit the option. When u think he hands it off he just takes it back from the rb. Hard to react
Imma start being a ravens fan if every game is this amazing
Game was a heart attack so far in NFL play best game wow
Was it me or was it number 90 in the beginning of the video running in Jordan 1 shoes?
Uncle Ray Ray came through for a good one😎🍻🍺
God bless you and God bless anyone reading this! Hope you have an awesome day!  Seek him while you can! Jesus is the way  and the only way and he is returning soon! Whenever you think you aren't loved... Remember the ultimate sacrifice was for love! ENDING YOUR LIFE IS NEVER THE ANSWER!   For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV   The wages of sin is death (hell) but Jesus paid our debt on the cross, for our salvation! We must turn to God and away from our sinful ways, Confess Jesus is Lord and believe with our hearts that he was risen from the dead by God, and we must be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and The Holy Spirit and live by His word and Commandments! Trust that God will help with the rest!   Seek God today before it's too late! Today could be your last day on earth! Have a blessed day!
I don’t know what it is but perhaps this nfl season feels so special and the players also feel it to be so special because we get to view these games live! The crowd is such an important factor to the players psyche!
I think what Chris said home field advantage is back fans wasn't there last year so the energy you can feel it
Too many ads on this video.
Some of the best early season football I’ve ever seen so far this year
SO do teams with poor defense win Super Bowls? The chief's defense looks like it was put together with glue.
I see everyone is saying the Chiefs fumbled it. Look at the replay again, the defender punched it out and the rb didn't have a tight grip. Well really he slapped it out. When they show it in slow mo you can see he slapped it out.
On the final third down of the game it looked like he was tackled 2 yards shy of the first down, but on fourth down the ball was marked just one yard from the first down marker, what did I miss?
So why they didn’t give number 13 on the ravens his touchdown on the state sheet
Hahaha Chiefs lost! #PATSNATION
*Yo! The NFL POPPIN THIS YEAR* 🤣
And yet another game where the chiefs get every single flag in their favor. Seriously?
Give my man some credit for once
I fell asleep and missed THE WHOLE GAME!!!!!!! but hey, at least we won!!!!✌️
Nick Wright is crying somewhere right now. Lmfao!
Where’s all those chiefs fans that said we were automatic 0-2?
Wish I was Nick Wright's house, so I could taste his tears.
They cant stop rpos
Too bad the ravens didn't win week 1 as well as the cowboys ah?
I mean, when you have the ball for 36 minutes you better score 36 points.
wow. jackson fire asf
As a Chargers fan the earlier game still has me mad/sad but the Chiefs lost… their defense looks terrible so far I think the Chargers have an actual shot at stealing a game in Arrowhead.
is lamar a better runner than most RB's in the game?
Hell yeah Ravens!
LJ YOUNG LEGEND OUTTAAA POMPANOO
Just went to my manager and demanded sundays off this season has been amazing so far this year 🙌
Congrats ravens for the early victory ✌️. 49ers fan
Chiefs defense is.....a big yikes
Patty boie is over rated. He makes the most dangerous throws and it will cost him his career.
As a chiefs fan, its always disappointing seeing them lose, but Lamar Jackson is just so entertaining to watch. Gotta love it.
Raven flock 😈😈
LAMAR GETS HIS FIRST DUB AGAINST THE CHIEFS WITH THE RAVENS PRACTICE SQUAD 🔥🔥🔥
That's Rivalry
Mahome's goal this year shoud've been 2-0, not 20-0.
LJ and Mahoms the 2 most entertaining players
It's rigged stop watching fb  ppl 😒👍 this never happened..I got better things on schedule
Lamar Jackson is a top 5 rb
He did it. He freaking did it. Wow. Gotta respect those effective read-option runs by Lamar
As great as Mahomes is he needs to learn how to just accept the sack. Idc how good his arm is, he needs to stop trying to make these hero throws
That mahomes Interception was sus .. rigged? What yall think
Win or lose, always a good game when the Ravens are playing
Go with what you know. Yeah Lamar needs to improve his pocket feel, he can do that in practice. In the meantime, don't sacrifice winning for development. Do the things that made him an MVP
People people listen. the ravens played well, as chiefs fan forever, I rather lose to a respectful team like the ravens than anyone one else. They have a great organization just like the chiefs, and they have so many players hurt. good game ravens, we will see you soon.
So glad to see the Chiefs at 1-1. They could easily be 0-2 right now. I’m sick of the hype.
Ravens hung in there all game. Key difference was that last second field goal before half time and the 2 missed Two Point conversions.
Nice, now we can be quiet about Chiefs going undefeated.
Chiefs really thought they got a free dub lol, all chiefs fans r so salty rn
Ha Chiefs just lost to the team we beat last week. Raiders are #1 in the West. Raiders gonna kick the Chiefs ass next time we play. Chiefs and Ravens are both overrated
Mahomes is 1-2 his last 3 games. He's garbage now.
Duvernay being Johny-on-the-spot as usual 🤘🏾
Lesgooooo big truzzz💜🖤
Excellent game....  Always remember anything can happen...  Continue to "Believe and don't quit" 👍
The defense stepped up and held the Chiefs to zero points in the 4th.
If you can’t stop the run you can’t beat the ravens #Simple
KC lost this game shot out to the Ravens but KC fumbled this lost 💯
Well deserved Baltimore. This will be in the top 3 best games of the seasons. As a Saints fan all I know is pain but it was great watching yall get the W tonight
Congrat!Go Ravens from Hungary!
WTF Happened ?
LAMAR GOT HIS WIN AGAINST MAHOMES LETS GOOOOOOOOO
What a game 👏🏻 👏🏻
The balls on harbaugh to go for it there.  Holy smokes.
Kc fans were handed a box of tampons that night
Non è stata una gran partita ma è stata una bella partita vibrante. Finora ottimo football in queste prime due week
Lamar shut a LOT of haters up here. He beat Mahomes, he came back from a deficit, and, admittedly after that poor throw into triple coverage, played very damn well.  The jump throw? The call to go for it with the game on the line? Knowing when to check down, when to rush, and when to take shots? He looked like an MVP starting that 2nd Quarter.  Edit: Also, just to spread the love, Mahomes played excellent as well. That pick was a major drawback on an otherwise perfect night for him. Some of the throws he made and his evasions in the backfield were insane.
LAMAR IS PRIME TIME!!!
Coming from a Steelers fan ,  The Chiefs let the trashy Ravens come back and win and then on top of that they don't play defense um um um 🏈
Yeeeeaaaahhhhhhh Talk yo Talk Lamar!!!!!!! It’s on now!!!!
no one gon talk about the patty mahomes int that completely changed the momentum of the game??? could have totally been avoided and was a stupid decision. but that doesnt matter hes still the best qb to ever walk the earth.
Lamar is such a horrible passer.
Hopefully we get another 10 years of this from these QBs! Great football tonight
Ravens won the first game out of 3 acting like a Superbowl. Win at least two more than I'll give y'all credit. Good 1st win though about damn time
#Sunday Night Football game of the year 💜🖤🏈🏈
Yeah and all u sorry mother suckers said the chiefs had an easy win lmaoooooo keep crying
Was there and it was insane, I couldn't watch , 1st TD my favorite was unspeakable
These NFL games have been so exciting lately!!
Guess Mahones is human...he has brain farts now and then like the rest us
No one talks about this but the ravens running game should not be this good according to naysayers but im sure they got 200 yds easily and devonta freeman getting 30 yd run makes this run game lethal.... im sure the ravens can make anyone a decent rusher..
Lamar vs Maholmes = Magic vs Bird  Of football
If only JW of the saints could learn from these two QBs. He certainly didn't learn from Brees. 🤦🏻
Wow
some great football this weekend so if the best i’ve seen in a long time lol
That's a tough L for KC they let the game get away from them
KC fans giving are the best at giving all the excuses of the world when others team beat them lmaooooo
Man as a Raiders fan this makes me feel a whole lot better for our season
there goes the undefeated season  how fitting that it comes against a team he never lost to
GAME OF THE YEAR
Lamar's stats have to be shown as Total td/ int to show how truly good he is. His arm did what it had to tonight
Lamar literally carried that team wow 👏
Don’t worry chiefs fans. Pats lost to a fumble 1st week. It happens
It's only week 2 and so many good games already  this season finna be good
The ravens would have killed the chiefs of Lamar didn’t throw those two early interceptions but he’s still found a way he just needs to be more consistent
Wow Going for it on 4th down was wild
Wow...that was a fun game. Incredible. Congrats to the Ravens for holding on against a dynamic tough team.
One hell of a game with two great Quarterbacks with totally different styles, the great arm talent of  Patrick Mahomes and the great Quarterback and running  back Lamar Jackson
Excellent game...looking forward to seeing this match up in the playoffs...wishful thinking ✊😬...CHIEF NATION!
so yes Lamar was great but stop giving him all the credit, his defense is the reason they won, if Clyde didn't fumble they would've lost. GG though. Lamar lucky
Damn this felt like a afc championship game already
Never sleep on your opponent never know what you can pull off go against your odds.
This arnt the 2019 and 2018 cheifs anymore... people can score on this guys and match up a shootout against mahomes
They need to stick to the run first Lamar.
Lamar beats the Chiefs  Haters: bUt HEs oNLy A rUNnIN bAcK
The only thing more impressive than these first 2 weeks is the amount of ads thr nfl is able to squeeze into these videos.
What a time to love football
Skip was right again.  Shannon keep taking Ls.
Insane game, great how Lamar rebounded
Lamar Jackson is gonna have a broken back carrying this team
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised…
Lamar have passed Mahomes as the best player in the NFL.
At first glance the dude at 1:13 looked like James Harden to me and I had to go back to make sure it wasnt 😂
Thank you god for sports 🙏🏾
I was AT the game and still watching highlights to make sure it's real. God, what a game.
WHAT A GAME
The last great commentator, broadcaster, Al Michaels. I can still remember your Early games of baseball and football. You were with the late Cosell and Keith Jackson, will be miss you're intros of the game.
What a gutsy effort by Lamar and crew man....Big time needed win.
🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
Insane game with an insane ending. Holy crap a lot of games in Week 2 went down to the wire. The NLF season is off to a fantastic start. FUll of upsets, game-winners, and unpredictability. I'm pumped! :D
That throw by Lamar on 3rd and 7 had me nervous. Good decision in the end though
What a great game
i was thinking right before the first play im liek man i hope Lamar learns to throw better this season. Pick sick
Dayum Lamar got us finally!!! Man played his heart out and mahomes threw a pick but its all good. Football is back baby!!!
Wow the run game was something to behold so much misdirection. It reminded me of the eighties and nighties football.
dam lamar is a beast
That Lamar Jackson  stiff arm was mad disrespectful 😳
Fumbling there is so inexcusable ... it is THE GAME.
Defensive fouls are BS....
Brown played an excellent game!! Roman called great! Defense played great and dint give up as many big plays.... made chiefs work for it and by end of game they were gassed out!!!  Sounds like a formula....
Good win for the Ravens but can they do this constistantly to get them to the SB? Time will tell but my money is still on the chiefs. Kc defense will improve as the season progresses.
I can already see Colin comparing Baker and Lamar over this mess
I’m not a chiefs fan and I’m not an expert in anything but they’re concerning me right now. They can’t run the ball effectively and their defense can’t play defense. They can’t play sloppy games and win with luck and stupid mistakes like they did against the Browns and the Ravens proved that today.
Man I love how my Ravens overcame adversity! They have 20 players injured right now, and still managed to pull of the W! The Ravens depth is truly impressive!
Lamar vs Mahomes. The two most entertaining NFL quarterbacks in the league right now.
Idk why but this game gave me Ravens vs Broncos 2013 double overtime vibes
That' was an incredible game
Great win. With that being said, hope Lamar manages to up his throwing game, bcuz it's difficult to carry on like this when it's playoff time
Do we deserve football this good? My goodness so many good games in just 2 weeks
There was a brief sideline camera angle near the end of the 3rd(???) where Lamar was standing on the sideline with Hollywood Brown and another player and he was telling Hollywood I Got This. Hollywood turned around with head down shaking No, as he walked to take a seat on the bench. Jan.11,2020 vs. Tennessee they cost me a new car. Tonight they cost me a used car. THAT'S MY RAVENS!!!
awesome game
We're all winners, we get to live in the era of LJ.
Lamar is fun to watch
Greatest comback ever!!
Gg ravens and ravens fans. From a chiefs fan y’all deserved this!! I’m glad we look bad right now. Hopefully this team pulls together. Chiefs D Is HORRID again
What a great game!
Idk if it’s the virus or what but having football back like this did not disappoint at all . Every single game this year is competitive and can go either way loving the start to this season .
Man these Sunday night games really got me going.
In 1 hour these highlights has 270k views. It’ll be at a Million by noon lol. Really thought the game was over after Kelce made that TD. Left the house and came back & Ravens was up 😂 Chiefs rook gonna learn from his mistake. Good game tho 🔥🔥
I like Lamar Jackson. But the caliber of the chiefs football team should never of made a qb throw 3 int and let them win .
Patrick Mahommes DaFuk Whooooooo???!!!! 😂  Jack is da Mannnnn.....
Good for you Ravens! RN4L
You have to appreciate watching Lamar Jackson play if I was still in Baltimore maybe him alone would make me into a true ravens fan
Can’t stop the running. Lamar Jackson is a BEAST.
If anything as Chief supporters we have to back Clyde up, more football to go and everyone will learn from this
Chiefs’ offence is good as always, just need to improve defence
Raiders !!
Can't sleep on them Ravens!
I'm new to the NFL but I'm enjoying the hell out of it
But but.... he can't  trow. But but... the teams will figure him out.  But but...he hasn't  won  anything.
So much for the Chiefs boasting about going undefeated.  LMAO!
Great win, but the Raves won’t go far with a defense like this…
Are you a circus seal trained to react to a ball..seriously mon, wtf r u ?
When I watch these two teams play I start craving grape and watermelon Jolly Ranchers. 😆
Despite Ravens having a few injuries and O line stepping up for Lamar. They most definitely could be that team!!
Don't get wrong Mahomes will go down as one of the best 5 QBs to ever play but his footwork is still terrible man. Watching Brady today vs Mahomes it's night and day in the pocket.
Geeeez that Lamar stiff arm was NASTY though
The Ravens won despite the desperate efforts of the refs to see them lose
Ravens have had 2 of the best games of the season in their first 2 games of the season
When I saw Lamar throw a Pick 6 on just the third play of the game, I lost a little hope. Going into the 4th quarter, down by 2 scores, I was telling myself it was over. So glad Lamar and the offense showed up after their mistakes. They’re going to need this momentum going forward
Wow
Nervous twitch 😬 inducing game!!
I love watching my boys in play. When I miss a game I love these highlighted videos. I feel like I didn’t miss anything! Ravens 2022
Unbelievable game!!!! And such a GUTSY performance by the Ravens!  I thought their goose was cooked more than once, but they NEVER gave up. Wow.
I can't stop wondering about the illegal man downfield call like 66 was deeper than 70... what was that?
Now we can call this a rivalry
Can anyone freeze frame whatever picture flashes at 07:18?
Seems like nobody could tackle on defense. The offenses did as they wanted 👀🥴🤷🏽‍♂️
The dashing day preferentially mate because drawbridge remarkably dry alongside a incandescent plant. hurt, breezy bolt
Chiefs one and done no more SB wins told You since 2 years ago
😭
Shout out to Ravens Offensive line. They bought Lamar some DECENT time to work with tonight for a change.
The legal cockroach singly accept because title evolutionarily attempt amid a early grip. lucky, telling helium
What a game! As a chiefs fan these ravens fans need to chill though. Acting like you guys blew us out it was a tough back and forth and Baltimore finished strong. Also Clyde is a bust and I’m not just saying that because he fumbled.
Fantastic finish.
Can't even imagine being on a defense vs LJ, dude has me fooled so much on his read option and i'm at home with a skyview perspective LOL. Ravens scary as hell this year being this banged up and having two very strong performances
Phenomenal
BMORE STAND UP THANKS LAMAR U GUYS DESERVE THIS WIN HARD WORK FINALLY PAID OFF🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💥💪🏿💯#RAVENSNATION#ANWEBACKONTOP #LAMARJACKSON
ravens beat the chiefs by 1 pt & people are blowing them lol Jackson is never winning a SB.
This is going to have a few million views
HEY YO!             Omar Comin!
But can they do it in the 3rd round of playoffs ??
Thank you Ravens...I hate the KC Chiefs!!! 🤣👍🏽👍🏽
Always a good day when the chiefs lose
Nick Wright will be pissed.... 20-0 no more for the chiefs..🤣🤣🤣
Awesome
Cheifs.are so badddd the Raiders beat them and they couldn't 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh....
Mahomes is not as good as legend Brady. Brady stays calm in pressure situation. Mahomes panics
Lamar is unreal running, but frustrating throwing
Broncos in trouble when we play ravens
This was a playoff game
Great game, I thought the comment sections were trolling saying the ravens won. Especially when I saw 3 minutes and 14 seconds  left on the clock in the 4th quarter. and the ball in mahomes hands then the two completions. Then the fumble happen, in my opinion Patrick would of won the game. But I can’t speak in would of and if’s to long. So shout out to Lamar and the ravens for the win
I always knew the key to beating them was Lamar trusting in their running game.
that was crazy
The dislikes were chiefs fans 😭
Chiefs got a couple Vikings players ! Jerick McKinnon and Latavius Murray !!
This may be one of the most competitive NFL seasons ever if the past 2 weeks of close games is any indication.
Best start to an nfl season in my lifetime. The prime time games have been unbelievable !!!
Lamar is the best quarterback in the NFL
I died like 3 times in this game. What an amazing game
This whole season been mf lit asl
He can't beat Patrick hmmmm . He can't cone from behind with that offense well well .
All the chiefs haters coming out of their small hole 😂😂 it’s funny
Ravens just gave the league a huge clue about the scary chiefs... KC has a powerful offense but their defense is TRASH.
As a Chiefs fan I'm glad we lost this game. So now Andy can stop taking his foot off the gas once we go up.
Lamar put on a clinic tonight
That's how we win
Damn Travis Kelce is good
Some of these throws that mahomes attempts would piss me off if I was the coach....smh
Everyone doubting the Ravens and they won anyway 😂😂😂
Chargers got robbed bad by refs/league... NATIONAL FIXED LEAGUE (nfl)  - 2 TDs called off, one for "illegal shift" and refs didn't even speak to Staley to tell him wtf happened.  - 3 additional plays for 30 yard passes (each) got called off for random reasons   - in this game Mahomes threw the ball as he was falling, it was called grounding not "sacked" because he hadn't touched the ground. Herbert was standing upright stepping back as he threw the ball and was called "sacked" which took chargers from 3 & goal on the 4yd line to 3rd & goal on the 15 yard line  ^^ maybe both TD flags were fair, but calling him "sacked" when both his feet are on the ground and he's standing up right?! Horse poop  - League knows cowboys are a bigger draw for "views" so of course they wanted to avoid cowgirls going 0-2
Poor KC, that UNDEFEATED season already gone, lol.
Everytime KC loss, America won
Not a fan of either team, but I rooted for Baltimore because I thought they needed the love. This was another of those good games that are more like end of season games, and I was impressed by both teams. That ending was crazy.
hell of a game!
Cowboy fan but this game was insane!!!!
Best football season in a long long time.
I'm sorry this Ravens team is good and I can see them in the playoffs but I just don't see Jackson winning a super Bowl unless he becomes more of a traditional pocket passer. The athletes in the NFLare just too good for one guy running around in the backfield to win it all.
Unless the Chiefs get at least a top 15 defense they are not winning another Super Bowl regardless of how good Mahomes, Kelce and the rest are on offense.
They deserve the super bowl .
Stephen A has nothing left to say about Lamar now. There’s no way no how that all of what happened tonight still wants to make him say he’s not an elite QB overall this was well fought and well earned. It’s a real deal you wouldn’t think the defense for BAL would at least be decent against the pass for KC but they were more Lamar kept everyone leveled up and focused. Top 5 QB in the game and he’s getting that extension this year. LOVE🤴🏿❣️🥷🏾
Instant classic!
So far this season has been INSAINE🇺🇸🔥
Two amazing but very different offenses! What a fun game to watch!!
So 20-0 talk over now????😂😂😂😂🤣🤣#Raiders!!!!!!
Mahomes will light up a scoreboard, but he will also make BS throws like the one he made on the interception he threw. Terrible decision. KC has a terrible defense….in case nobody noticed yet
Lamar Jackson is so humble, he's always giving the entire team credit. I'm so happy the Ravens Defense woke up in the second half. Continue to play that way, Ravens Flock!!
Alot of butthurt chief fans. 🤣🤣  Remember people Buccaneers are winning it all again.
Congrats from a Bills fan. It's okay we hate the Chiefs too 🔵🔴
"You can't beat the Chiefs running the ball Actually, if they avoid turning the ball the over, they often have considerably more time of possession. Passing is riskier and if the defense can't stop the run, why would you stop?
I said this in the titans Vs Seahawks game.... Great games all over the NFL and this is another one. Damn NFL lit this season.
Congrats Ravens. Reality check though, thank KC running back. That fumble was inexcusable. If they keep it in Mahommes hands or legs, you be 0-2. Facts
Good fking game!
They literally scored twice in the end zone with the exact same play. I'm not even mad at the chiefs.
This game was lit 🔥
They going to meet again in the playoffs watch
The chiefs need to sign good cornerback.  They need to sign Richard Sherman
As a raider fan I would just like to thank the ravens for beating the chiefs for us. Paid ya back, we beat the steelers for ya so win your division well do the same and well meet ya in the playoffs.
As a Raiders fan, I approve of this  public spanking of the Chiefs by the Ravens. 😝
Ravens still need a true #1 reciever tho till they 100% true Super Bowl contenders...brown still nice af tho
Fine football we are having so far! Im really happy to see Lamar and the Ravens pull off this win. Good for them
best game all year
Gutsy call by the Ravens to convert that 4th down at the end.
I was there! My first NFL game 🔥 The game and atmosphere insaaaaane!
LOL LOL HAHAHAHA LOL LOL. This is what happens when the refs  don't bail the chiefs out. BANG BANG NINER GANG
Any given sunday. Not a fan of either but glad the ravens beat the chiefs. It's funny I was rooting for the raiders in wk 1 to beat the ravens and they did and then I was rooting for the ravens to beat the chiefs and they did.
Jackson was on fire! "matrix run"
Lamar Jackson is literally the most exciting runner of the football I've seen since Vick
So what’s the narrative now ? With 15 players on IR and Lamar still manage to get the job done , stop playing wit that man !
Damn we beat the chiefs with literally an injured roster
Gg KC always scary when we play yall
My voice is gone 😈😈
Hell of a game....just wish my vikings could find a kicker😥
The thumbnail was mahomes interception throw LMAO
Ehhh…
I'm from Kansas City, and I have to say a defense this bad deserves to lose. Mahomes and Kelce deserve better
Ravens really already have 2 of the top 10 games of the year in the first 2 weeks
Mahomes is a loser
1 point has Baltimore thinking they're elite just 1 week after losing to the Raiders, who seem to be a more competent defensive front than KC.  I cannot wait to see their high horse torn back to Earth once they realize KC's defense isn't that good.
Think I cried
This game was off the MF chain......
What a game
Zero points in the 4th Qtr from Patrick and the Chief’s. 👎
Get ready for a great season.
This season is officially of the rails. Can’t wait for the lions to somehow beat the packers tomorrow
Really funny to see all the salty   chief fans trying to insult anyone who says "good job" to the Ravens. They better get used to losing, and crying.
chiefs defense usually won't shows up until the playoff time.
The Ravens have played 2 game of the years. And it’s only been 2 games into their season
Well there goes Nick Wright's dream of the Chiefs going undefeated, lol
Kc going to bowl no doubt
Are we still trying to call Lamar a quarterback. He’s the best RB in the league but those throws in the first half were terrible.
Tampa Bay embarrassed KC QB, they made him look like the mediocre he is and now everyone is following Tampa’s blue print, I’m so glad that bum got exposed… this season will be  awesome…
What a game and it didn't go into second consecutive overtime for two straight weeks. Wow...
Only week 2 and it's already a crazy season
This game is a testament to how great Tom Brady is. You give Brady the ball back in the 4th quarter with over 3 whole minutes left, that’s a big no no. Just look what he did to the cowboys. That’s the most recent example. He’s been doing it all his life. Clutch times is where he’s the calmest.
So much for undefeated season nick Wright
ridiculous how the NFL gave the ravens 5 prime time games this year wtf smh
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE CHIEF'S NEXT OPPONENTS.😂😂😂
D-Line are suck
Tells me two things: Ravens are class of the AFC North. AFC is up for grabs.
So much xciting ds season, specially against caliber team.. go tb12🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Broncos and Raiders have a better record then the chiefs i don’t care if it the beginning of the season still
NICE JOB BALTIMORE!
Ravens, on a short week! With literally 20 injured players beat the chiefs after gifting them a pick 6! 🤣 this team is built different!!
Go Raiders
Game of the year
I told you before and I say it again Mahomes never be the same again.
Damn I missed the end of this game... I thought it was over
AFC championship?
Wtf was Mahomes throwing to on that INT, the kid needs to get slapped and told he can’t make every throw lol
Elaire fumble and Chiefs D Line beat Mahomes, relax.
These Primetime games freaky
With 15 guys on injured reserve and another 5 injured (not on IR), the Ravens beating the Chiefs (a 100% healthy Chiefs team) here was huge.
Some crazy games already and week 2 ain't even over yet.
Seems like my Ravens are always in these WILD shoot outs. Who remember the Poop Game last year against the Browns? Then you have them against the Raiders last week on Monday Night. Now the Chiefs...
unbelievable .  KC's defense is really suspect . Not going to the SB this year , I think .
Lamar,Kobe,Messi,Lebron,Kevin durant- next level athletism with skill 🔥🔥
Release #25. In two years I have not seen anything from this guy. I cant believe KCC investing in this POS running back.
The amount of people here saying Lamar won the game is absurd, you all know if CEH doesn't fumble at the end it was over right?
iTs NoT a RiVaLrY
mauser rifle out to 600 plus yards today windy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pfnWvSrOeE
"The greatest sh!t defense show on turf." Thank god we won though! I didn't think we would beat the Chiefs with our injury list. Proud of Lamar and the boys.
We've been blessed with so many great games this year already!
Kansas City has a horrible defense I doubt they go to the super bowl
they better pay Lamar Jackson soon he deserves it.
Last week's game against the Raiders: BEST NFL GAME OF THE YEAR This week's game against the Chiefs: Hold my Boulevard Beer.
It’s hard to find y’all Lamar haters right now 😭
WOW! Complete disbelief 😲👏👏
Nomore LamaR Jackson slander !! Especially what he did tonight with the two picks , come back second half & did it himself !!! We still here !!! That offensive line looked way better
My money is lamar getting injured before the 5th game with all his rushing hes doing
Can wait for Undisputed tomorrow
There have been 3 game of the year contenders in 1 Week lmao
I eagerly await the day when that showboat Lamar Jackson gets clobbered because he thinks he's a running back.
14:00 that ravens power set is crazy
No more 20-0 @nick wright😛😜
Yessir, I was screaming while watching this game. We finally beat them.
13:48
Harbaugh's play calling, wow. What balls!
Whoever called that run play….DONT TAKE THE BALL OUT OF YOUR QB HANDS FOR THE GAME WINNING DRIVE
Woah.
Chiefs offense is killer but their defense is weak.
I really hope people didn’t bet on the chiefs to go 17-0 this season
Baltimore knew everyone doubted them they just played ravens football and didn’t get too out of character good win
Uh, defence, anyone? Seriously, hate the Ravens, but L Jackson is undeniably awesome.
Ravens exposed KC defense, that run game tonight was NASTY
On behalf of all raider nation we’ll be celebrating this W with you guys. Thank you🙏🏻 🏴‍☠️
The Autumn wind is blowing 😳
The Talking Head Homers for KC will NOT talk about KC losing. Theyll find something else to blame.
Wow what a game
I can't wait to hear what Stephen A. Smith has to say about this.  "Let's just give Mahomes his props for going into that environment and only losing by one. That's not easy."  He'll do anything except give Lamar his props. 😂
This has been the most unpredictable start to a NFL season I think I’ve ever seen lmaooo
Damn What A Game 🔥🔥
Lamar is so nasty
When the Queefs lose, the league wins!
I feel like we’ve have 5 game of the years already…it’s week 2
RAAAAAAAAAIIIIDERRRRRRRRRS 😮‍💨👌
Lam !
So much for 17-0
Lamar é monstruoso demais…⚡️💪🏾
Have faith in Lamar 🙏
This is the best start to the NFL season,so many good games, the ravens down the overrated queefs!
congrats to the ravens..do not celebrate too much..lol
Thank you to Lamar and Kelce who saved me last second from losing in fantasy 😭😭😭😭
Not a raven fan but Mahome is over rated and will not win another super bowl
PHENOMENAL
This was a big win for them, so much for 17-0 chiefs 😂😂
Lamar Jackson you not gonna win in my house Patrick Mahomes this is my Kingdom
What happened to nick wright saying the chiefs were gonna go 20-0🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Sheesh
I just watched the game and I already want to watch it again lol
If this is week 2, what's gonna happen in week 18? Absolutely insane start to the season
I was 6 yards away from Helaire from losing my fantasy game and then he fumbled, lol thanks
WHAT A GAME
Lamar literally got better every single quarter. Crazy game
Wow! Mahome's 1st loss AND interception in September.
So happy the Ravens pulled that off. That first interception shouldn’t have happened. Should’ve won that easier.
Bruhhhhh we can already tell this season gone be good
I'm a Patriots fan for life but since I seen Brady leave to bucs I been saying I don't know if anyone gone stop them from winning a super bowl I think they win this year again lol unless they play the Patriots in the super bowl
Baltimore got double lucky with this one. KC controlled most of the game.
4th down on their side of the field damnnn
What a game indeed.
Man most of the primetime games has been inssssssaaannne!!!
Lamar Jackson is a ball hog. Super predictable and that’s why my Raiders made him fumble 3 times lol 😂
WHAT A GAME, WHAT A QUARTERBACK! -From Tampa
What a game. Easily one of my favorite games of all time
Gutsy 4th down that was a close call could of lost that game Ravens but no and thank u for that my Raiders balled out today...☠☠☠
As a raiders fan, I thank you ravens.
I swear it’s like the game is in slow motion for lamar
Lamar got so much heart 🔥🔥🔥
Lamar had to put the team on his back for this one ☝🏾 Great win!
Wait this wasn't part of the script
We need to just trade back to low first round picks every year cuz we seem to pick great players in that spot damn
Let me say this, don't Come to me and tell me that lemar Jackson can't not be the better team. He did it without jk dobbins, their New rookie RW. So don't Come to me with the BS.
Ravens MVP Clyde Edwards Helaire. Lamar didn’t win the game. That dude won the game for the Ravens
Heard a lot of trash talk about Lamar…what a game is right.
I have never seen the chief getting comeback from the ravens 🧐
Lol stop chiefs fans u lost. Ravens made more plays end of story. Browns fans last week have the same feeling as u enjoy it till next week
Somebody go check on nick wright
“Not bad for a RB”
Me very time the ravens and chiefs play each other it’s game of the year
Wow I can tell KC hates Clete Blakeman😂
Raven fans gonna be wearing their jerseys all week
Stop making excuses Chiefs just lost. If the Patriots old dynasty lost gams then the Chiefs will. Just like they take credit away from the Bucs by saying they didn’t have an O-line.
Lamar is doing everything
The 🐐 would’ve won the game with that much time left.
RAVENS LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is it week 3 yet I need more football
Poor tackling by the Ravens number 71 helped the guy get a TD.
Is it jus me or is honey badger playin a little lazy 🤔
This a season for the ages
K.c gave that game away hilarious to watch.
they earned that W, stick it to the chefs.
Oweh > OBJ
That 2nd half defensive comeback is on another level. Go Ravens!!!
This was an absolute masterpiece of a game Lamar showed how he elite he is a qb
12:00 Matthieu got flagged TWICE for "Illegal Touching", both questionable, but this (see time stamp) was okay?  This should have been "Illegal Touching", Pass Interference or even Holding.  Take your pick but NOTHING.   Chiefs gave up after the Mahomes pick but the refs sure screwed them over too.  Lots of stupid calls on both sides.
My favorite part about this whole game is at the end when the ravens went for it on fourth…. You see John Harbaugh ask Lamar if he wants to go for it…. The head coach let Lamar make that decision. The absolute FAITH in your god damn quarterback.
This game sucked
Any time Mahomes loses I am happy.
Poor Nick!  😂
The Ravens were the Raiders from a week ago, forcing turn overs at the right time.
4th and 1 coach to Lamar ...you want to go for it? Lamar: hold my beer my beer!!! God I missed football!!!
Lamar straight up carried my fantasy team
If you've played Madden, you understand: 1.) The Ravens are that guy that runs the same few plays over and over! And says stuff like "If it works, why change it?".  2.) The Chiefs are the guy you can hang in there with, but sooner or later, they'll make a few plays that are either complete skill or ABSOLUTE LUCK, that will win them the game!!
GG Ravens. Tough one to swallow as a chiefs fan and our defense was all over the place but our offensive line was excellent today & probably the most positive takeaway from the game and I can’t wait to see the chemistry continue to grow. Chiefs defense didn’t show up to play & Ravens wanted it more. Congrats to Lamar for getting his first W over Mahomes.
They deserved that win!!!
Everyone said I was dumb when I told them the Raiders would beat the Ravens and the Chiefs would lose to them…  Then they said I was dumb when I told them the Raiders will beat the Steelers…  I want to make even more ppl mad so I’ll say the Raiders win the AFC west and finish 12-5 in 2021….
That's that man FLA str8 threw
Just here to say the Vikings should trade a first round pick for Justin tucker I know it’s not relevant here but I just want a kicker
RAIIIIIIIDERS!!!!!!!!!!
woo this season is lit so far
The ravens knew they could not give the Cheifs the ball back with a minute left good game now Lamar is 1-3 vs Mahomes
wow dude. this was an amazing game. jackson is gnarly.
The Ravens Defense looks old and slow
Lamars Stiff Arm at 2:54 is sooo nasty. Derrick Henry really birthing all these peeps haha
Whuutt, a gayme
These games have been ridiculous so far this year.
The Chiefs has so much talent
What an outstanding game!!! So now, as a revamped Cleveland Browns fan, how do I imagine getting a victory at Baltimore on November 28th??? It, already, is looking like each of the AFC 'power' teams are winning at home and losing to each other on the road. What a great season this is shaping up to be!!
let's go lamar
Flight is going to go crazy reacting to this game!
Stop Doubting My Team & My Quarterback🗣🗣
Lamar Jackson and Mahomes!!! It just doesn't get any better! Great game!
Ravens fans went through 2 wild games back to back lol omg
When did the NFL start allowing defensive players to wear single digit numbers? I haven't really watched in a few seasons
AND they almost lost to the other AFC North powerhouse last week lmao.  RIP KC
Ravens are garbage!
Can’t believe Lamar finally beat mahomes
This man Lamar is the Qb and Rb
Phenomenal win for Lamar. BS calls in Matthieu. You can’t call illegal touching on a 5 yard bump at the end of the game. Either way Lamar definitely earned that win but still BS on the refs as usual
The chiefs RB that fumbled needs cut
Damn you 3rd shift! Looks like I missed a great game.
I love how harbaugh asked Lamar if he wants to go for it in the final 4th down. Lamar of course said yes, and harbaugh responded with “let’s go” lol. Great win for the ravens.
What excuses Steven A Smith has now?
REDEMPTIOOOOOOOON-NUH!  #RAVENS4LIFE
does that mean raiders are good?
Kansas city chiefs will have won if he did not fumble
The Ravens Defense needs to get it together they are the weakest link.
How in the hell we win lol, RAVEN 4FORVER
Thank you to Baltimore for ending the Chiefs perfect season already.
I’m just here for the comments. 🍿  And to say how awful the Chiefs Defense is. 🤢🤮
This has gotta be the most thrilling single week of NFL football in recent memory. Like the quality of all the games today....just insane and how most of them ended neck and neck. Awesome stuff.
😈 Lamar played a hell of a game!!
Afc championship preview perhaps?
I still can’t believe we finally beat the Chiefs but we lost to the Raiders but we beat the Kansas City Chiefs What
Ravens better offer LJ a contract extension of about 40 mil a year now, if they wait, he will want 50+
“Hey Chiefs”, try playing a little defense. That was a pathetic showing.
I was about to say “I wish the NFL would stop putting the game winning team in the thumbnail as it removes the suspense” so I kept on waiting for the ravens to fall apart 😂
35-36 Ravens Never give in. Never, never, never.  Anything can happen
GREAT GAME!!!
Great game for sure, but that KC defense ain't going to no SuperBowl if they don't improve.
Literally so many comments trying to discredit him already. Congrats Lamar! You have the most injured team in the league and you beat the Chiefs. Fun game to watch as well.
This  was a game. It was a hard game but my Raven won. Congratulations  on your  first win.
Raiders-Steelers, Cowboys and Chargers, Titans and Seahawks and then this game, what a great weekend of football.
I Love football. And this game proves why.
Come on what's the excuses chiefs even fans was saying chiefs win this game but not me You got to show me Ravens let's go
How u gonna lose to the raiders but beat the chiefs lmaooo
Thats My Team ####RAVENS ###PURPLECITY
Does mahomes make these same throw from super bowl man this kid is good
What a game!
Not gonna lie, I love Tyrann Matthieu… but what the heck was that throw Lamar?
I’ve always wondered do colorblind people read Colorado as ‘ado’
10:05 watch 71 on the ravens. The chiefs still score on this play but look how he never gave up!
Waiting on Colin "situationally" Cowherd tomorrow!!! 🤣
The football gods corrected that bullshit call at the end of ineligible receiver downfield. Justice was served.
This win felt so damn good man
Primetime games are killing it.
If the rest of the season will be as the first 2 weeks. Holy cow
Tomorrow Stephen A. and Shannon will give little to no value to Lamar while on the next segment they will simp for Rodgers
Thank you Ravens from a raiders fan, for last week and this week!
Only 2 weeks and this season already better than last year
Minor setback for a major comeback 🗣 loss to chief 3 times and we show what we are 🤫
THEY BLEED!
Las Vegas aka the house always wins
GOOD JOB REAVENS #CRYCHIEFSCRY!
never thought Jackson would beat Mahomes. This is gonna be a great season.
Raiders > Chiefs
Lamar put the away tonight. MVP quality some would say.
🏈Don't know what to make of this game.🤔It was kind of eerie to watch an early poor performance from Jackson and yet the Ravens were still able rally back and defeat KC in their own stadium...Hmmmm.🙄🏈
haha nice!!
A fumble.........A damn fumble.
Somewhere Bill Burr is laughing. He’s always said that the Chief’s are beatable to a running game.
Chiefs receivers are UNDERRATED.  It is hard to tell how good Mahomes truly is.
Lamer Jackson most likely will never be a great "traditional" QB from the pocket. His skill set is not geared towards that. But he can become a solid to good pocket QB while being one of the most gifted runners and overall players that the league has ever seen.
Sucks my team lost but it was a fun game to watch.
So far I feel like there is no guarantee  favorite to win it all every team has a weakness
The crowd just progressively got louder @10:34
What a great coach Harbaugh, AFC is on notice I think the Ravens have finally embraced who they are and making no apologies
When all lamar does is run. mahomes > lamar and always will be
Well done Ravens! That from an old Pats fan
Its not how you start, its how you finish
Oops ! Well guess that 20 - 0 Chiefs season is up in smoke hahaha 🙈🙉🙊🤔🙄😵😬😳😉😛😝😜😂😏🤓🤗
I’m a ravens fan and I felt this game is unreal…
You're Welcome AFC West.
Despite some bad throws from Jackson they got it done! Can't let the Ravens run like that. Great game
This ravens season already been insane
is noo one gonna talk about tyreek hill having 3 catches for 14 yards? against a ravens secondary with no marcus peters, plus others ?
Lamar just led a team with 15 players on IR to a win against a team with pretty much every single starter and backup available. Lamar is a top 5 qb and should receive no more slander after this game tbh. Every single odd was stacked against him. U rlly cant even make those excuses
This plus the cardinals game, keep it up nfl America is the winner
lamar had his heart in dis game
Seriously how bad was the raven defense I'm just asking
Great game but who told me the Ravens was going to lose
That was quite a finish too see on the video you provided.  Personally I didn't have faith in the ravens and Lamar Jackson! Oh well I guess will see what happens by wk. Eighteen.  Thank you again. WR, 🇨🇦🇺🇸🇨🇦🇺🇸🤠🤠🤳🤳🤳🤳
LMAOOOO Big Nose Nick Wright is gonna be salty. I thought the Chiefs were going 20-0
Edwards-Helaire is a bum literally just had to run clock, not fumble, and gain a couple yards smfh
Mahomes outplayed Lamar but the defense was terrible. It’s crazy how we still woulda won if Clyde didn’t fumble considering we have one of the worst defenses rn😂 goes to show you how good the offense is
As a Chiefs fan this crushed me. You do so well on offense just to get smothered on defense. Especially against players that are injured. Lamar Jackson is great at running, but we're using 25% of our budget on our defense and paying so much for them to play and yet they can't even make one good move. If we don't get a ride together we'll be lucky to get to the wild card
Lamar Wow I just loved watching him play some great football
Skip Bayless going  to have fun with Shannon tomorrow,his cowboys won Tom Brady wow  KC lost wish he hates
Hell of a team win!!!!!!! Had no doubt they would get this W💪🏿✊🏿😈😈😈
Wamar Jackson
Nice hard-fought win. The Ravens need a Number 1 WR or they'll never win the Super Bowl.
Why are the ravens fans acting like they just won the super bowl in these comments? Before you try and call me a Chiefs fan, I'm not.
I love upsets. -Just a loyal Chargers Fan
When Lamar ignores the coaches telling him not to run the ball so much
From a die hard Chief's fan: congrats Ravens fans. You truly outplayed us in every aspect possible.
So yall are just going to leave out the clip of that outrageous illegal contact penalty that was called on Mathieu that led to the Ravens scoring a TD to cut the lead to 5 huh, definitely didn't want anybody seeing that lol... One of the worst calls I've ever seen 😴
Lamar looked great!! His speed is next level,also he might be the shiftiest runner in the NFL. The scariest thing tho, is his accuracy and read progression have improved dramatically. Thats a scary dude to line up against
My one take from this and I said it before… the Las Vegas Raiders are going to win the Super Bowl . I’m not a fan either , just a hunch
Lamar Jackson is the best player in the NFL.  To me he’s the best runningback in the NFL and one of the best quarterbacks.  It’s crazy to watch him.  He’s like more exciting than Reggie bush at USC.  He’s pure electricity and magic every time he laces up
Atta boi Ravens fans!!
RAVENS FLOCK!
These primetime games have been bananas...who else is picking the lions tomorrow night??
This a good a year of football 🏈
So many mistakes on both sides. Good game nonetheless
Congrats to the Ravens. And thank you.
With such a banged up team, just wow!  Well played Ravens!
This is how an elite QB deals with adversity good job Action Jackson. Props to the coaching staff and the team well done.
That's a banged up Ravens. Wow!
Seriously this is building up to be the best season of football EVER! Am I right???
These Ravens games are getting really boring and predictable.
Game of the Week!
KC's defense is pathetic.
Chief's deserve the fat L. They better realize that they'll get more Ls and I hope they do with that defense.
Defense was trash and Clyde fumbled the W a nd Lamar took it and ran with it!
If Lamar can be consistent with this type of play I’ll call him elite but we’ll see it’s a long nfl season the dude definitely looks good tho
GAME OF THE YEAR
As a chiefs fan gg to the ravens. Lamar played good, I was happy with Mahomes had us driving to finish the game until that one play (can’t even say it) 🤢. Our defense is looking horrendous
ESPN is gonna dig so deep to find ways to not give Lamar credit for this win.
It couldn't have been scripted any better when Baltimore beat Kansas 36-35 today.  #36 pitcher beat Kansas City on the road, #10 drove in the game winning runs. Kansas City lost to #10 who was on the road. #36 Pitcher from Seattle and Lamar Jackson are both born in the Florida area, both 24 years old.  Baltimore scores 36 points, Kansas City gets their 10 game winning streak snapped.  Kansas City loses 1-7 at home, Lamar Jackson born on 1/7, so Kansas City was gonna lose to the guy born in 1/7, at home.  Kansas City Royals fell to 15 games below .500, Patrick Mahomes #15.
3:45 = thumbnail 10:35 = another thumbnail
PM15 had a great run being "Mr September." Hope to see many more battles between these two awesome teams. Great Ravens win!  *Go Ravens!*
Wtf the Ravens finally beat the Chiefs 😂😂
Chiefs are going to the super bowl this year - save this comment.
Never give up
Lamar Jackson finally beat Patrick Mahomes in this rivalry 😈😈  Ravens at Lions Next Sunday 1pm on CBS
I love how they put the thumbnail as Mahomes even though it was a horrible throw
CEH holds onto that ball and Chiefs get the W.
So no one noticed how at roughly between the 8th and 7th final minute of the game the clock still was going … even though the ravens passed the ball and the receivers ended up out of bounds twice . And the clock just still goes . Crazy indeed.
99 is a hero for the Ravens
8:18 What?!?!
Hope you show the game changing Tyrann Mathieu penalty .. Commentators even called bs
ODAFE! JAYSON! OWEH! REMEMBER THE NAME
Wassup nick wright 20-0 lol
Just got back from the ER. The win sent me into shock.
Why are there so many games of the year type games and it’s only week 2????????? Chiefs vs Ravens, Ravens vs Raiders, Cowboys vs Bucs, Giants vs Washington football team, Vikings vs Cardinals  This season is insane!
So Lamar threw 2 picks and is leading a completely butchered Ravens offense and the defenses #1 cb is out for the season too.. and Lamar and the Ravens still beat a KC team who has all there starters back and they did have a bunch of huge plays.. and the KC fanboys like Nick Wright of espn are going to say well it's still 3 to 1.. and that's what a  fan like Nick would  say but.. this is by far a better win then any of the 3 others could have possibly been LMAO.. omfg I can't wait to so see Nick tomorrow on tv talk about how the KC chiefs "should" have won and they are the best team hands down ..this weekend was amazing. Brady throws 5TDs  and IS on the best team hands down and the chiefs aren't going 17-0 LMAO.. sorry KC fans but Nick has made me dislike the chiefs very much bc of how he is always talking about the Chiefs in such a fanboy/fck boy way..saying stupid crap like Mahomes WILL replace Brady as the goat or making excuses for the Chiefs why they got curb stomped in the super bowl or saying stuff like oh they're going to go 17 -0 and there's no way the bucs could do it and that the bucks won't even make it to the super bowl again...well  he also said that Lamar and the Ravens had no chance and we just washed how that turned out
Well this yr isn’t guaranteed like the others for maholmes he’s gonna be tested this yr the league has to adapt. He’s so good though but the league always adapts. Like Brady said he didn’t know how hard football was till after his 3rd super bowl ring
Very Satisfying Game!
when the ravens eventually get even a mediocre passing offense watch out
KC yes you too can be beat have a slice of humble pie KC Fans there will be no going 20 and 0 and just beating everyone down sorry
Lamar a goat
His running game makes his passing game possible...that's his bread and butter...BUT John Hardballz got nuts of steal......Every coach in the NFL WOULD OF PUNT!
FCK that fumble the ball
Can we get the full game footage?
People need to start putting respeck on Lamar's name. This dude repeatedly delivers with injured running backs, o-line , and defense. His offensive weapons besides Andrews are inconsistent too. They do have Justin Tucker tho.
The ravens have played back to back game of the years 😂
Gooooo raiders 😁😁🙌💪. Glad you guys beat the chiefs! 💯
Hey Stephen A! Hey Steeler Nation! You still think your better then the Ravens? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
FCK that fumble the ball
I’m glad to see that with all these injuries we still have a fighting chance… it was Rocky vs drago tn.. never bet against Rocky! 👊🏼😈👊🏼
It happened it actually happened
Love this team 💜🖤🙌🏼
Ray Lewis was by the Chiefs sidelines sharpening his knife set after halftime
I can’t wait to watch first take👀
Madden curse had to hit one of'em 🤷🏻‍♂️
This what happens when I procrastinate on my assignments. I'm stuck writing a paper and I miss the best game of the year.
Nick Wright has some explaining to do....
One of the best games I've seen in a LONG time.
Lamar is a one man army!!💯
Wow...
Chiefs lost in the most Chiefs way possible. We we’re ahead and the Chiefs let the ravens play comeback football. Our defense like Okafor, Niemann, Hitchens needed to step up especially when Mathieu had 2 picks with one leading to a touchdown.
The chiefs defense has struggled for years now. We need to figure SOMETHING out.
“💨💨💨💨New Chiefs pack in the air is gas or what? “ Good Game to both teams
The Ravens have added a white feather from the chiefs head dress and are wearing it on their hat.   Don’t explain why this is racist, explain why a Raven is wearing a hat.
Gd it chiefs 😡🤬
AL MICHAELS defines the NFL
Game gave me a heart attack
Man the Ravens secondary couldn't tackle a wet paper bag!!! Looks like a 7th grade team out there trying to arm tackle if i was that DB coach the only drill I'm making them do all practice are tackling and wrap up drills!
Now the ravens gotta get they revenge on the bills
lamar jackson put it on his shoulders in the 4th quarter.   ravens zone playing way too soft but got a couple big turnovers to win it.
And Stephen  A Smith said Lamar isn't ELITE.
I feel like this season is going to have many more upsets ! Nothing is for sure with any team so far except the bucs !
Lamar didn’t give up but... didn’t show he was an amazing qb. 2 ints and had opened lanes and receivers all 2nd half chiefs defense was handing him give mes. But his legs make it possible to play how they do so it works and sometimes it doesn’t. If they meet in the playoffs Lamar can’t play the same and win I know that for sure.
Lamar Jackson was awesome!
AND LIKE I SAID PATRICK MAHOMES IS A HAS BEEN OVER PAID LAST YEARS NEWS. DUMP HIS CARDS!
Elite ball placement.
If this is what Thursday and Sunday night games will be like this year, this is going to be an awesome season. Grats to Lamar and the Ravens for finally getting one over the Chiefs.
Lamar is not a normal quarterback yes, but he does whatever it takes to win, he might not play like every other quarterback, that’s why he’s special, people just hate because he’s not doing the same thing everyone else is doing. But he’s making a statement.
Now everyone in the AFC north is 1-1. If I accurately predict here’s what it’ll look like at the end of week 3  Pittsburgh 2-1(plays Bengals) Baltimore 2-1 (plays Lions) Cleveland 2-1 (plays Bears)  Cincinnati 1-2 (plays Steelers)
even with all the mistakes the ravens made, still came back and won it. great games and great win. now for all the excuses on why the chiefs lost lol.
Lamarvelous! Lamar Jackson finally gets his win against the Chiefs! What a great game!
Wow
Was up 1 point ... CEH fumbles the ball and I lost by 1. Automatic trade block
Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry saved my Fantasy team today…
Finally they can shut up bout Lamar
Holy hell
All I needed was 3 points from Clyde Edwards to win fantasy this week
Dear NFL, please put Lamar thumbnail, we don’t need losers thumbnail.
best game of the seaon so far! LAMAR MVP
Wonder What Nic Wright Excuse Gone Be Tomorrow
Referees interfering in yet another game.... conspiracies if you ask me
Just so happy to have witnessed this from my boys🖤😈😈💜😈🖤🖤
Ravens fans have been through the WRINGER these past two weeks
Is that what you call an unbelievable pass by mahomes can cause your team is intersepted it...
The Dallas Cowboys would've won this game too
Ggs to chiefs they played a good game👏🏾
Ha-Ha !!!🤣
3-1 Patrick not going to do Lamar like Brady did Payton
That's it if there's anyone else better than Brady and Mahomes is Lamar Jackson what a catch and plays also quiet magician I name it outstanding game That's what I'm talking about!
Thank you so much for nocking this 6 man team around from a Bills fan!!!!
That Kelsy touchdown was kinda crazy..look how much bigger he is than that whole entire secondary, lol
11:15 So that may have been a "by the book" definition of ineligible man downfield, but that rule enforced in that moment only exists for gambling interests.
🖕🏻 the chiefs. Good job Lamar for leading your ravens to an amazing victory 🤘🏻
Broooo even tho we beat you guys last week I'm glad you guys beat KC . Much love ravens
*Lamar still throwing like a little girl !*
What a game
I heard folks talking abt Chiefs 17-0 this year. These TV guys know less than my office team members
Buffalo is gonna best both teams.....you heard it here first
The amount of times Lamar Jackson ran the ball was crazy I’m so mad that we didn’t cover him better if we had we could have done better. We’ll get em next week go. Chiefs!! ❤️💛❤️💛
Great win for the Ravens, what a game
The GOAT wouldn’t have let his RB fumble the ball at the end of the game…smh
I’ve seen a lot of ppl sleep on the Ravens but Jackson really does the most for that team. The play fakes were nuts and offense was great too. What a game! Congrats on the W Baltimore, from a Saints fan.
And they were talking undefeated season could not even make pass 2 weeks
We chose to draft an overrated running back instead of a stud receiver in Tee Higgins. Let that sink in.
the chiefs better grow a defense, and FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crazy game had me up on the couch
Lamar's mental fortitude to bounce back after those 2 interceptions is my favorite quality of his, doesn't hurt when your teammates believe in you as much as his do
KC coming harder next week🖤💪
WAMAR WACKSON !!!
As Raiders fan, thank you guys so much for beating the chiefs!!! 😁 We’ll see the ravens again in post season
Peep my music bout as good as this game👀
FLOCK NATION
This game was so good that last play where they ran it out of the gun was legendary. Ravens are the only team that can run the ball so good that they can make it so obvious what they are gonna do
Bro it’s just the second game.
I LOVE watching the Ravens play, with Lamar
All these upset in college and pros they where just waiting for the crowds to show out that goes to show the crowds make a huge momentum difference
Mahomes is awesome, but this choice wasn’t the best 😔 10:33
Those 2 fouls on Mathieu was hilarious but give it up to Lamar eventually he was going to beat us … 3-1 #ChiefsKingdom
Nick Wright in shambles
us ravens deserved that💪🏾
Game of the year
The ravens out played them.  The chiefs looking sus this year
Well played Ravens
That game felt like a eternity.
No one wants to talk about Lamar's passing yards or rushing 1st's. Get caught up on the 2 int, still won the game. People just want to stay hating on the Ravens when they do well lmaooo
F ya Ravens #GoBroncosCountry 🐻🥊🥊🐴🐴🐐🐐🔥🔥🏆🏆
I dont even know what's happening right here
This was like a scripted football movie, that game was unreal
WOW! What a game! One of the best games I've seen in a long time and I don't support either team.
brady would of tore both them aholes
Seeing Lamar Jackson run is a blessing. Different.
Good can’t wait to see Nick in the morning
Great game cheifs! But as a Ravens fan this felt like the Superbowl, 1-3 we finally got the W over Mahomes.
Wanted to come here & give y'all in Baltimore some respect from Cleveland. We couldn't get the job done last week, & I know that game & tonight will come into play towards the Playoffs, but congrats on this win! 🟤🟠🤝🟣⚫
The NFL season should just be  Chiefs Vs. Ravens every week.😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😃
Is bob sutton back coaching the defense? These first two games have been shameful for the defense. I would be embarrassed to show my face if I was on that D 🤦‍♂️.
Only 7 undefeated teams left already that's incredible. Rams Broncos Panthers Raiders Cardinals 49ers Buccaneers
Damn Raiders are legit.
The Quiefs choke again. lol.
Refs get a F this week. Refs need to be graded every single week
This was another exciting between these MVP quarterbacks! In the end, Lamar Jackson got the win with a little help from the defense late!
Blah blah Kryptonite blah blah 0-3 blah blah…..every game is a new game 😈💪🏾 LETS GO FLOCK
https://youtu.be/rIUGuV0hppw
There were a lot of upsets today
Chiefs' defense was lame on the running game. They are always winning because of their excellent offense. But tonight they lost due to a defensive fumble.
Wow...they finally did it...
Chiefs defense is so incredibly trash atm. Browns ran all over them last week, Ravens this week, and every other team now knows all you have to do is just run to beat the Chiefs. If their defense stays like this throughout the year fire Spags.
Whatta game! If only they had a healthy squad, they would be incredible!
Only week 2 and so many close games
Big win no more of that we can't beat KC BS
They better hope they don’t see the chiefs in the playoffs
Thames did this for Omar
Hats off to Lamar for finally getting a W on the Chiefs! We would have had it if not for that dang fumble. Nevertheless great game!
BIGG TRUZZZ 😈🖤 We Shocked the World tonight. Proud of the Flock and Lamar For stepping up after making mistakes early. And Oweh #99 is a Problemm😈
Now Lamar Jackson have only one more thing left to do
Lamar got it together after those 2 INTS. what a game.
https://youtu.be/rIUGuV0hppw
Can’t nobody really “ beat “ the chiefs , they Always lose by very small margins
Clive - Edwards Fumblair
Lamar Jackson has literally silenced every critic in this game
Brah chiefs defense is ass that’s y they won
Lamar over Patrick
What a crazy game, thought those 2 picks early on were gonna cost the Ravens the game but way to battle back!
RAVENS ON TOO
Week 2 and we already had 2 game of the year candidates from the ravens
When the ravens are in rhythm they are almost impossible to stop,.The key to beating them, is containing lamar jackson. There was countless plays on the chiefs side that just let lamar walk in the gap like a running back. Props to the ravens on sticking to their game plan and coming out on top.
Such a bad call on that ineligible man downfield.
So does this mean Raiders>Cheifs
Good ass game Lamar Goat
That Mahomes pick was the worst interception I've ever seen thrown.
Me as a ravens at the end: LOL we won..... wait.... WE WON!!!???   HONEY! WE WOOOON!!!
At least Chiefs chocked this one lol
This was supposed to be impossible. “You can’t come back from two scores in the fourth quarter against Mahomes with your legs.” Two rushing TDs beg to differ.
NFL UPSET
Kelce is no way near as good as Gronk
The FIRST TWO weeks of this season has been insane, I can't think of another season where the first two weeks was this HYPED. So many good games especially prime time games.   This one says a lot, who knows..  We all know the ravens and cheifs will make the playoffs and maybe this time, the Ravens are just better this year, and maybe the Ravens will face off with the BUCS in the Superbowl, that would be fireworks with Brady slinging the ball and Lamar slinging AND running around with it. Can't wait for more football, I love you football community, it's been a beautiful great entertaining stress relief thus far.
As much as I love the chiefs, seeing the ravens and Lamar finally beat them just feels right
What a game. Congrats to Lamar for taking down Pat for the 1st time.
Both QBs have identical stats Patrick mahomes 346 total yards rushing/passing with 3TDs,  Lamar Jackson 346 total yards  rushing/passing with 3TDs.
Everybody please say a prayer for my Detroit Lions. We're going up against Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers, and you know Rodgers is gonna be out to redeem himself after his terrible performance in week one.
I was sad than happy than sad than happy than depressed than the most excited I’ve even been 🤣 Lamar set the team on his back and did what he had to do GG chiefs
NFL>>>> any other sports league
What a game!
finally man we should b up 2-0 rn tho but it’s cool 💯💯 I just watched this live game was crazy 🥷🏽😭
How many game of the year contenders have we had this year already?! 5? This season is going to be insane
There has been like 5 "game of the year" games so far and its only week 2
Oweh is a Monster 👹
Man the chiefs run defense is dogshit.
It’s only week 2 and these are games we have wow can’t wait for the rest
Incredible game, congrats to the Ravens 👍👍👍👍
Wait thai Mahomes guy is supposed to be the best qb in the league?
Hear me out Lamar may become the best and most dangerous qb he scares me with how he changes the game
Chiefs made too many mistakes to win this one.
And just think about how many Ravens starters are on IR or done for the season.
Seems like in every sport the underdogs have been winning or is it just me?
Looks like the system QB has his first loss of many
What I liked this game was Lamar played through real adversity today 3 turnovers Lamar had and he kept his resolve all the way through.
I'm happy for Lamar for beating his nemesis. The shadow of Mahomes is no longer a burden for Lamar.
Finally them legs working!!!
They finally did it the ravens have beaten KC as a fan of the ravens I am so happy.
The more I watch him the more I'm convinced Jackson is gonna be an all time Hall of Famer
Ravens always gotta make it interesting. GG both teams!
The whole league is sooooooooo good.
I don't know why Mahomes attempted that throw on the pick... it was completely unnecessary
Where them doubters at?????
I can't wait to hear from nick on first take 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who is here after just watching this live. Ravens always have the most exciting games.
Finally got them.
I'm just here cuz I love watching the Chief's lose 😁😜😂🤣 #raiders
I thought KC had them there at the end! Some great games in the NFL so far!
lamar is back to his old self
KC always puts on a show
Lamar "Action" Jackson looks unstoppable, throwing and running the football.
Thank you Raven flock! From a Raiders fan! We both did a favor for each other!
Lamar put the team on his back tonight. Put some gosh darn respect on the MVP’s name!!
This season is just on a different level
The Chiefs are 1-12, in the last 13, against  the spread. ¡wonderful!
what a shocker down to the last second lMFaO RIGGED........................................................................................
Skip gonna be on unc head tomorrow 🤷🏾‍♂️
I thought it was going to be a disappointing game when Lamar had 2 int in the first quarter. He turned into Superman after that and carried the ravens on his back. His ending stats don't look amazing, but he was the man tonight. Hope we can see part 2 in the playoffs
ive never been able to understand how nfl refs have a huge mic right in their face and u can still barely hear them
Game of the Year
YESS I WIN SOmE MONEY on this game I know I’m a kid but Thank u
Mahomes may well be the better passer.... But Jackson is the bigger threat.
That’s my MF TEAMMMMMMM 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
Go chiefs 👍🏿
What’s up now Stephen A smith 😡
soon as you see harbaughs face you knew what he was gonna do😂
So pumped up rn #flocknation
LOL CHOKED 🤣
Glad The Ravens Won #BigTruss WOO WOO
I thought for sure the ravens were going to lose this game based on the way it was going.
Lol....sorry-ass Chiefs. Yall THROUGH.
I was at this game very intense but we won in the end
Do it in the playoffs
Ravens finally beat the cheifs cause of 1 fumble late lol. That fumble just coughed it up
That was a fun game
I love this team so much!! Even if we had lost this, I loved the showing they put on tonight! This is one team I never regret repping!!
I’m Texans fan first and football fan 2nd. Every time Ravens play Chiefs I’m going for Ravens. So yeah watching them finally win was like a BOO YAAA
Damn the Ravens really had 2 games of the year in a row to start the season
Lord help us, Skip Bayless was 3 for 3 with his NFL takes today. Tomorrow should be a trip 😂
letting Lamar run that much and in that way is pretty risky
And the rivalry continues 🤡(bruh Jackson finally won one 🤣)
Is Lamar even a QB or a Running Back I don’t even know anymore.
Slowly, I'm noticing  the progression  of Lamar jackson against "Mahomie". This was a good game. Obviously the better team won.
each week gets better. the crowd was hella live too that makes it even better
Chiefs starting 1-1 sounds insane. Hey people who see this in a few years
I’m loving this season so much. Amazing game.
FK KC
2018 chiefs defense making a comeback. GGS ravens
Big Al had a bounce back game shout out to him 💯
A lot of teams are 1-1 now…   Huh 🤔
Wow
Broncos and Raiders have a better record then the KC Chiefs lmaooo
yessir lamar szn
Lamar is a top 5 QB. Top 4 over last 3 years. Just a great player, and an X factor in its truest form.  Has proven he can carry a franchise on his shoulders all on his own.  Edit: my top 10: 1. Mahomes 2. Brady 3. Rodgers 4. Watson 5. Lamar 6 Russ 7 Kyler 8. Herbert 9. Allen 10. Carr/Dak
This game was amazing, and I say this next part from the bottom of my heart as a Broncos fan  F*** the Chiefs
I apologize for everything I said
This season is gonna be just unexpected endings all year long it seems 😂
As a Ravens fan, I’m happy we handed them probably their only loss this season…
Too good one hellva game. Congrats to LJ8 and the boys. Hoorah
Was the best teams in Madden 21
I have a feeling Rashod Bateman is bout to really help Lamar once he gets back....man shout out to Lamar ...far as I'm concerned he made one mistake which was on the second pick ...the first was unfortunate and not on him...LFG!! and the steelers lost at home .....today was a good day.
Ain’t no way boy 🤯
Week 2 had a lot of great games but I think was the best game of the week.
when Lamar jumped in the air i thought he was going to roundhouse the guy out of the way lol nice win give the guy a cape.
I was at the game easily the beast game I ever watched go ravens!
Ravens are again in the game of the week.  But this time we won.  Against some pretty heavy odds I might add.
Hope the chiefs enjoyed their cute little run over the afc. The patriots are back ready and to take back the crown with our new young prince 🤴 mac jones
Damn did I hate watching the last minute of this video
LETS GO RAVENS! This season has been entirely different for every team, right back where it used to be!!
Baltimore Stand Up!!
Chiefs would be 0-2 if Browns weren't such losers.  Mahomes has two wide open options on every play.
Can we now shrug off the "can't play from behind" narrative?
Wow, what a game. Felt like a championship or Super Bowl type game. Ravens are a problem
what a game
5 Turnovers in two games by your quarterback, does not equal Superbowl.  Lamar needs to fix this....
Excellent job Lamar Jackson
If these last two chiefs games have told us one thing, it’s that the chiefs aren’t running through the afc this year.
This is what I like to see Go Ravens 💜
Lamar got it done with a 78.8 QBR v Mahomes 131.5 😂😂
Everyone talking about how great MNF TNF and SNF have been during these opening weeks but nobody talking about the ravens being in 2 of those games. It goes to show the Ravens are one hell of an entertaining team
Ravens fans last week: *sweating* NOOOOOOOO Ravens fans this week: *sweating* YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Week 2 was just as crazy as Week 1. This season is really turning into one of the best ever
I thought both QBs played well in this game in spite of the interceptions.
Wait until Denver plays you. Denver will beat the hell out of you
Game of the year!!
Lamar might have just signed his check - Contract incoming... Big Truss - Lamar Jackson - Woo woo
Release CEH
It’s hard being a chiefs fan, just a roller coaster of unbelievable offense and terrible defense!
These games have been amazing so far.
Soon ray lewis came I knew we were going to win the game
All I gotta say is we’ll see mfs in the playoffs. And mahomes is 3-1 against Jackson so who’s better?
This season is going to be insane
I am beginning to like L. Jackson so I say this with admiration...don't run so much, you will get injured!
Nick Wrights 17-0 prediction made it two games.
Man what a great week this has been. So many good games Chiefs/Ravens, Seahawks/Titans, Vikings/Cardinals, Giants/Football Team, and so many more. Hopefully this continues throughout the whole season.
Lamar Jackson better keep it going , ravens defense looked lost
Nice Touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Demarcus Robinson.
I'm sure we have the most players injured at least key players
It’s gonna be a wild season,real fans know how crucial these early Ws are
When the Ravens play two game of the years in the first two weeks
How about those 2-0 Raiders?!!!!!
Lamar Jackson Phenomenal QB.
Lamar Jackson’s beast
THIS GAME WAS INSANE CONGRATS RAVENS MY TEAM PULLED THE IMPOSSIBLE YOU CRAZY BASTARDS
Chief’s defense looking like it did in 2018 lol and our offense is still relying on Mahomes doing the most. I’m a bit concerned tbh
Alright boys, is it time to trade Ceh on my fantasy team?😔
Insane
I think everyone forgot how dangerous the Ravens are. It was time for a reminder.
When you get a 7 spot and still lose.... smh - can't wait to hear Nick and Stephen A tomorrow
*Fun Fact* Brady had more TD's today than both these posers have all season combined
Every team we play gon have 2 battle til the end
Ravens with back to back game of the year candidates and it's only week 2
Raiders atop the AFC West. YES!
This was def best game tonight
SuperBowl hangover is real
Lamar cant throw?
Chiefs defense wtf
Nice to see patty boy humbled.
Ggs
lamar haters better shut up
I really can't believe the Ravens came back from 35 - 24.  Just didn't think the Chiefs machine would slow down.  Crazy.
This going to be a wild season hold on to your hats
Aite now, yall better start giving Jackson his props 💯💯
Not even mad the Chiefs lost they played a hell of a game
Props to Lamar for actually attempting deep passes now. He’s not accurate but he will get there with the jumps he has made. Just has to stop throwing into double and triple coverage
It’s always nice to see the chiefs lose
I heard that the Raven's couldn't win a game from behind....
Ravens are crazy good
Game of the year? >>>>
What a game, I'm not happy with how we played, but GG Baltimore fans, you guys played hard and deserved to win -  A chiefs fan
Game of the year so far. Amazing game
Lamar had cold feet at the start but became action Jackson by the end
Raiders fan here, great game, couldn't ask for a better outcome.
Nice hopefully teddy bridgewater can dismantle the chiefs as well
The ravens have 15 players on injured reserve while the chiefs only have 1. Imagine when we get some of our guys back like bateman
Week 2 coming to a end Monday night and it’s already been one of the best
The ending was crazy 🔥
Yup. The life of a Viking fan....... Sigh.
Phenomenal game, again. Look at that Lamar and entertaining games…who woulda thought?
At this point I feel guilty for the amount of incredible games we’ve been getting
Glad the Ravens won 👌🏼
these late night games haven’t missed
Yo, I'm a Steelers fan but even I have to admit that the Ravens are one of the most exciting teams in the NFL.
That dodge at 10:05 by #65 is WILD
Mahomes played like a highscool jv qb tonight, not happy
So Pat Ma-homie blew an 11-point lead, eh? Gee that's too bad.
Through most of this game the Chiefs had control but could never knock the Ravens out.  They kept on hanging around.  Mahomes makes only 1 INT but came at the worst possible time for KC.
Pat has the most amazing arm I've ever seen on a quarter back. His form, aim, anticipation and accuracy are ABSOLUTELY sound.  His decision making is the only negative thing i could possibly say.
Bro so If Clyde doesn’t fumble in a “fumble and we lose situation” do the chiefs win most likely?
look at number 51 at 12:57, he is clueless
STOP HATING ON LAMAR
If you're a 49ers fan and you see how the Ravens dominated the Chiefs with the run, you're even more pissed off with Kyle Shanahan's playcalling in the Super Bowl against them a couple of years ago.   Aside from that, great game between the Chiefs and Ravens. Magic Mahomes and Action Jackson were outstanding once again.
Can't wait to see what Stephen A Smith and Molly have to say tomorrow on First Take they low key hating on Big Truss
Also notice wit ths two team trade draft picks nd players they both r winner in the trade move they made
Welp looks like skip won That bet “SHANNON 🤦‍♂️ LOL GO RAVENS
"hey lamar! LAMAR.. do you wanna go for this?!" -John Harbaugh (Mr balls of steel)
Chiefs are no longer better than the Ravens. Jackson > Mahomes.
Sad I missed this game, would’ve been a fun one to watch
Wow 😲
I was at the game it was lit
Raiders are going to have there hands full next week
Watkins first year as a Raven beats the chiefs
GG today Ravens and Chiefs!! You both gave it your all today!! The Ravens proved themselves to all the haters today!
Definitely will be a candidate for game of the year
A Chiefs fans so about 20-0? I don’t think it’s going to happen just like y’all going back to the SuperBowl 😂😂😂!
Just tell me how the hell my Ravens managed to pull this one off? The Chiefs had us down bad! AMAZING GAME!!
@NFL, You need to improve these highlight videos. Less minor plays. More replays. Thank you!😁🔥🤘
Lamar is one of the funnest players in the legue to watch as long as he is not playing your team.
Wow wht a game I jus realize the KC didn't score after the 6:50 mark in the third quarter thts super crazy
Regardless of how you feel about Lamar’s skills as a QB, you can’t deny that he’s one of the most electrifying players we’ve ever witnessed.
RAIIDERS
Hahaha the chiefs are done! Back to the Broncos reigning for years to come!!! 🐎
Season already turnt up just after 2 damn games 🤯
Ravens didn;t win, chiefs gave that to them. Their game plan sucks!
2 weeks of the nfl this already becoming one of the best seasons
Congratulations to Lamar Jackson the Ravens, and their fanbase for winning their first game.   Chiefs, better luck next time.  Good game, though.
The ravens really clutched up on this one. GG chiefs
Did the raiders just beat the chiefs by default
Crazy game
#what they gone say now!
Never forget. Odafe Oweh was the man we selected with the KC pick. Tonight he forced the momentum changing INT and forced and RECOVERED the GW fumble. Y'all still wanna make fun of his 0 sacks in his last year at Penn State? Ravens got a monster of a player
BIG TRUSS
Number 71 helped Kelsey score at 10:14
The broncos will sweep the chiefs this year 🥳🥳
thumbnail looks familiar Lol
For 2 weeks in a row, the ravens have had the most exciting games, gj lamar!
Lamar is exceptional. Amazing. Crazy.
I thought the Ravens were going to lose with 16 injuries.Glad I was wrong!
Every time these two teams play it just brings out everything great about football I had this game circled on the calendar for months And it was even better than the wildest expectation Cheers to the NFL🔥🔥🔥
wow
Lmao can’t wait to see all the excuses from KC fans in the chat 😂. My browns didn’t get no break from a dropped punt and rare fumble by Nick Chubb. Chiefs a failed punt away from being O-2 no cap. But y’all can keep sleeping and thinking that the chiefs gone win with that defense. They also had an 11 point lead lmao.
Not gonna lie I had my Ravens losing man I'm so happy to be wrong. Go Ravens
Hell yeah *uck the chiefs
When Vegeta ( Jackson) finally defeats Kakarot/Goku( Mahomes)
What a game. There isn’t a chance that I’m gonna sleep tonight I’m so hype. Lamar played fantastic
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
guess what tyreek…. “✌🏿🏃🏿”
One of the games of the year for sure
Chiefs lose 👍👍👍👍👍👍
This season is going to be awesome. Thumbs up for every player and fan. Let's go
Not to mention that we came from behind to beat the Chiefs. Take that pundits
Lamar proved he can win a playoff game, proved he beat his kryptonite chiefs, proved he can throw. Proved he can win his division and make the playoffs consistently. Proved he can win an MVP. Now it's time for him to do one more thing, y'all know what it is.
This intensity of game in this year AFC championship….    Sign me in!!!
Take the L garbage cheifs
Ravens gonna be the most entertaining team to watch this year mark my words
LJ8 really went week 14 Browns on them minus the bathroom break
What a game. Lamar Jackson  carried that team on his back🔥 🔥 And although that defense looks shaky but it won the game for us. And that’s how you win football games. Defensive plays 💪🏿. Now Lamar go sign that contract go get that 💼
Let GO RAVENS!!!
Pay that man. He literally carried that team to the dub.
He tried to recover the ball with his feet. 😅😅😅
This game was incredible!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 f KC
Lamar is my favorite player to watch since he was drafted and I'm a colts fan he's ridiculous
How bout dem ravens 90% we lose pre game sikeeee das the wrong number
Guys it’s only week 2 and we’ve already had potential “game of the year” games.   *CAN Y’ALL JUST CHILL*
I BLEED PURPLE 💜💜
What a game tonight
Im so glad i watched and witnessed this
@9:33,  🎶"I Believe I Can Fly!"🎶
while everyone clowing the seahawks and their defense ... and cant keep a lead...
So glad football is back 🙌🏽 now if we can get back to a time where defense is allowed to play defense then real football will be back
That was a chess match
how’s the perfect season dream going mahomes?
Niners 2-0😏
Lamar is amazing
This game showed the ravens that they need to keep playing their style of football. Everyone says you can’t win from behind by running the football. But you can when you have someone that can get 10 yards per carry. Even when the playoffs come they’ll be fine if they keep running the ball. The last 2 years in the playoffs they lose when they get behind and think they have to throw. Until the defense puts 8 people in the box the ravens can succeed by running the damn ball.
You know it was a good game when the highlights are 15 minutes long
This is the 3rd comeback game of only the 2nd week. We are in for a season!
You know the media will be like "but can Lamar beat Mahomes while holding his breath and reciting the alphabet backwards?" 🤣🤣 Great matchup.
I swear God Chiefs can never win super bowl championship
ANOTHER EARLY GAME OF THE YEAR CONTENDER?! When I wished last week that every game of the season would be as exciting, I wasn’t taking it seriously!! Two Primetime games, two early contenders for Game of the Year! Surely, the season CAN’T get any better than this next week... ; D
Lamar Jackson finally beat mahomes
Odafeh Oweh is such a beast 🦾
mind blown!
Just think, the charger and chiefs are 1-1 and the broncos and raiders are 2-0. What is this world coming to.  Good job on the Ravens for the win and Lamar for closing the game
Thank you Lamar for giving the Queefs 💨 their first L of the season
Ravens ty on behalf of Sin City Raiders. Great game on both sides. fun to watch especially with Queefs L. lol
Only Lamar 🙏🔥
GAME OF THE YEAR!!
I don't wanna here any Lamar slander ever again
John Harbaugh's got BALLS
What she says when I unzip the 👖 13:38
The double digit comeback Lamar had to complete against the team the Ravens HAD to beat. Against all odds with most of the biggest starters gone, they did it. He may not be Mahomes but who cares… He’s one of a kind. Enjoy every second of this young man’s legendary career. It’s a privilege to watch Lamar Jackson play football.
Ravens have been apart of 2 of the biggest games of the past 20 years in back to back weeks
But they say lamar can't come back from behind multiple scores,yea okay😂
Good game
LETS GO !!!! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 #RAVENS NATION STAND TF UP !!!
This game stamped a spot in the NFL History Books! Lamar Jackson! “ Mama there goes that man” 🔥
Somehow that Lamar haters will say this game doesn’t count even though they came from behind double digits against the chiefs
14 players on injured reserved and they still found a way. Lamar can carry this team but I'm actually impressed how they took care of Tyreek hill. They didn't care who else got the ball. you can't let that man go off
Every fan base has had a heart attack so far this season lol
Tom Brady threw 5 Tds, Cowboys won and Mahomes lost, man first two weeks have been out Skip’s wet dreams. Ernestine getting it good on Sunday nights 😂🤣
Can’t wait til next week. I’m finna have a load of fantasy points coming from austin Ekler cause the chiefs defense is sorry 😂
Lamar is fun to watch. Glad he got his 1st win against the Chiefs
Lamar Jackson is better then most quarterbacks, and better then most running backs, at the same time, this man actually is built different.
Chiefs should be 0-2 right now 😆 . At Least Now This 20-0 Bullshit Has been put to rest against Nick Wright .
Finally no more chiefs fans saying there going 20-0
After week two the only undefeated teams left are the: AFC  - Broncos  - Raiders  NFC  - Buccaneers  - Panthers - Niners - Rams  - Cardinals   This season is going to be really interesting.
0:52
Ravens been in 2 really good games this year this season is going to be very entertaining
Bills fan that's a massive LJ8 fan, I legit want him to win that damn bowl.  Beat the Chiefs  Won when down late Beat a team when they didnt have a lead   Just stop the BS narratives....
If this was the playoffs ravens would’ve lost 💀
These first 2 games have been Absolute Bangers #Ravensflock
Don't see why people say the jump was unnecessary wouldn't have gotten it over the ol otherwise
we all know lamar started off as bad as possible but he worked his ass off to come back and get that win we gotta respect how good he was after the first
perfect season? WHO?
Great game but the commentary was so MEH
This was the best game of the year and it will be for the rest of the year
Mahomes and Vanilla Ice = 1 Hit Wonders
What a game! Although the bad decision to throw and get an interception at the goal line by Jackson is why he will never win a SuperBowl! Let's go KC!!!!
Reid HAS to put his trust in his QB there. I understand they were winding the clock down. However, field goals are not certain. Baltimore isn’t necessarily a fast scoring team either. You have to let Mahomes do what he does best. Play to win, don’t play to not lose. Huge difference Reid. Congrats to Baltimore. Lamar played a heck of a game and that was a great call to go for it.
When the Chiefs lose, its a good day...... Or night depending when they play.
"No one is touching the ball but me!" Lamar jackson
It’s funny how people change up lol
one thing we can all say is lamar fighting through adversity is a scary sight.
As much as I love Lamar that second pick he threw just made me laugh
Late flag of illegal contact on Tyrann Mathieu won the game for the ravens.
Raiders, Broncos, Chargers fans, how we feeling?
Ravens games in 2021 be like 🔥 these days.
I feel like there is a curse that people just forget that they shouldnt arm tackle when they play the chiefs lol
John Harbaugh: do you want to go for it Lamar Jackson: what kind of question is that hell yeah
Missing 15 players and the ravens still pulled it off? Wow…..
Imagine trying to play it safe and just run it only to have your Rb fumble the ball. Story of my life in madden lol.
Good on Lamar to not get rattled after that terrible start. He really just kept getting better and better throughout the game and showed up when it mattered most. Good game
chiefs' defense is marshmallow. Better get them going quick otherwise, teams are gonna tear them apart.
Hopefully Lamar get's the respect he deserves, he's a phenomenal talent and super entertaining to watch.
this game was so entertaining to watch. Lamar played his hearts out to get that win
LaMarvelous Jackson
I’m so happy someone popped KC. Not because I hate the team, but because of their toxic fanbase.
S/O Lamar getting that first dub against Mahomies
Chiefs will miss the playoffs...Hot Take!!!! They certainly not winning anything with that trash D and no running game. Lolol.
Literally EVERYONE except chiefs fans were rooting for the ravens! 🥶 We just got tired of the chiefs always beating them!😇
9:51 that was a clear block in the back lol
Clyde Edwards-Helaire sold
"No chance"
Bro Lamar went off in this game
Incredibly entertaining season so far, starting from the first Thursday night.
this season already going crazy😭
My home team won I’m proud of the ravens 🙏🏾🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾
Ravens playing in The Game of The Year back to back weeks and YEARS !!!
Tom Brady > Patrick Mahomes. Prove me wrong.
Chiefs still a defensive mess that can’t stop the run 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
As a Bronco's fan good job Raven's.....but we have to play them in 2 weeks 😳
20-0 no more
LAGOAT JACKSON 🔥🔥😫
Mahomes exposed yet again. Anyone mentioning him in the same breath as Tom Brady is a straight up clown and shouldn’t be taken seriously. Without that pick six to start the game, they lose this game by 8+ points. Pathetic. Huge win for the Ravens. What a game.
Another day another Lamar narrative dead 😵🔫
This is becoming one of the best NFL rivalries in the league right now
I've watched 4 games so far this season.... All 4 have been edge of your seat, highlight reel 4th quarters.  Man I hope the rest of the season plays out like this.
The last decision Lamar and the HC made and their execution was one of the greatest
9:05 what happens when your safety doesn't go full speed
Skip bayless bout to go crazy tomorrow 😂
🔥🔥this season so entertaining
Just Remember: Ravens Made A Comeback When The Score Was 35-24…& Half The Teams Were Injured KEEP THAT IN MIND
Does this mean the raiders are better than chiefs and ravens?
Congrats to Lamar on his first win in the Lamar-Mahomes rivalry!
Plus the end zone is not even finished...where's the grounds crew ?! Lol
I think what really started ravens up was that bad call on Mathieu for illegal contact????? It negated a sack and they ended up scoring on that drive
What a game... wow
Lamar is the reincarnation of Barry Sanders
I’m a chiefs fan but i didn’t know the run defense was THAT bad but really good game by both teams
I bet every Chiefs prolly mad as hell right now😜 #RavensFlock
Lamar isn’t a quarterback
As a Chiefs fan good game Ravens. Lamar won really good, he played really well, and he has a really really future in Baltimore. Good game.
lagoat jackson😹
Congrats Baltimore but chiefs D has been a huge disappointment.
All the good teams in the AFC are 1-1 except the Raiders, who would’ve thought that….🤔🤔🤔🤫🤫🤫
lamar got all the bad plays out in the first quarter so that he can show up for the rest of the game
Great game. The only bad part was the intro with the brain-dead Trump supporter and anti-vaxxer in Carrie Underwood.
#RavensNation😈
When chiefs at the bottom of the afc west LOL rn.
Game of the year!
Happy to see Mahomes lose
Damn man😕 I guess 17-0 will never happen, gg ravens 3 years late but yall did it.
So far these prime time games has been amazing this year!! Love it!
What an insane game! This season has been fun to watch so far
Ravens oline was atrocious and with so many key player injured, idk how the Ravens and Lamar were able to pull this off. Lamar something else man. The team feeds off him, it's clear as day.
Two weeks already and I’m already getting so many heart attacks from these type of games that have been happening so much!
Last year I didn't get why CEH was a first rounder, and I don't get it know
The blame doesn’t fall on Clyde. It falls on that high school caliber defense 🤦🏻
So proud of my goat
So we’re not gonna talk about the penalties against Matthieu
This may be biased but I think I've witnessed the best SNF game in a few years. I'm at a loss of words and still can't believe that my ravens won.
Uh oh! Oooooooo lolol! Also go Honey Badger! Louisiana State University is so proud of you!
This is why Lamar and my Ravens are prime time games 🙂
😎
CEH sold the game
As a Ravens fan, I’ve waited four years for this.
Thank you Ravens - A Raiders fan
Goatmar
Haters can’t use “He cant beat the chiefs” against him anymore, I wonder what they’re gonna say next lol
That feeling of beating your kryptonite has been so satisfying for lamar and the ravens fans. That Ray Lewis dance Hype from the beginning sure paid off
I had a feeling that the ravens were gonna upset tonight it was long overdue and even though I have Hill AND Kelce on my fantasy I was rooting for them good job ravens
This season looks like its just going to get better and better. So many bangers. Also want to give props to Lamar Jackson and the Ravens for finally beating the Chiefs. With how banged up the team is, it was obvious as to why no one game them a chance but they came out and proved them (Me too since I was one of them) wrong! Happy for him.
Lamar may have been ass the first half, but hot damn. He put the entire universe on his back when they needed him to
Honestly I'm not really seeing a difference from the SB. There big issue, other than Mahomes being pressured 5000 times, is if you stop Mahomes' passing lanes, the run is clearly not going to cut it. Along with that atrocious run defense.
Ravens like watching a team from 1965... run every single play.
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t happy to see  the Chiefs lose, especially early on. Nonetheless, this was a very exciting and theatrical game to watch. GG
Mahomes has lost his daddy privileges (congrats to Lamar and ravens)   Tom Brady is still mahomes dad
Lamar for mvp x2
Textbook definition of grit from the Ravens given all the injuries and circumstances... WHAT. A. GAME!
All the prime time games except for the Bears/Rams game have all been great
As a Chiefs fan, great game. A true shoot out. Both defenses couldn’t stop either offense until the Ravens made a great play and forced that fumble. Clyde you had ONE JOB, just hold on to the ball lol. Crazy back and forth game. Hopefully we see a rematch in the playoffs.
Wow, crazy upset for Baltimore! This season is shaping up to be very interesting already
There goes 20-0
As a raider's fan this makes me double happy. Chiefs lose and this makes last week's win look even better.
Man only 2 weeks and this season been one of my favs so many good teams who's gonna win superbowl browns,chiefs,49ers,bucks, ravens, idk
As a Chiefs fan...they did NOT deserve to win this game!
You know how many Ravens were out this game?  Ronnie Stanley Chris Westry Miles Boykin Deshon Elliot Derek wolfe Daelin Hayes Jimmy Smith Rashad Bateman Otara Alaka Nick Boyle Aaron Crawford Jk Dobbins Khalil Dhorsey Gus Edwards LJ fort Xiaver Kelly Iman Marshal Marcus Peters Tyre Phillips Justice Hill Ridiculous Chiefs……
Thanks Lamar I just won 2100 bucks because you went for it at the end!! Woot woot
Everybody knows the ravens shouldn’t have won that weak ass fumble and we was in Field goal range🤦🏽‍♂️
4th & 1, 1:05 remaining... John Harbaugh (through his headset): "You Wanna Go For It?"
The only game where I didn’t  care which team had possession; both teams have incredibly dynamic QB.
wow
GG chiefs fans
Omg i love how both team is playing like it's the Supwerbowl title. Everything one the line
This season is starting off right. Another classic in the books!
GG ravens man wow
Eat this, NFL!  Let's  see you hide your hate on my team now!
Lamar is so overrated but good win
Good Game to both teams
LAMAR PUT THE SQUAD ON HIS BACK!!! #RAVENS
What a game from start to finish
I'm a titans fan, had to come here to congratulate Jackson. Glad he got the W
Bahahaha damn chiefs, given up 405 yards rushing and 7 rushing tds in 2 games. Smh ahem that outta tell you something 🤣🤣
Just play this game every week
Imma Steelers fan but I love watching the raves play rs good W for y’all🤝
Lmfao and somehow people still think these losers are going to keep Tom Brady from winning another bowl
I'm a Chiefs fan and I'm going to be honest we got out played almost every way I don't feel very good about this season I know it's only early but I just don't feel good about it
LAMARVELOUS
Lamar is slowly breaking narratives... happy for him
The fact that 85 percent of America went for the chiefs makes this game that much more satisfying.
The flip
The trade was clearly worth it. Have fun at left tackle OBJ.
AQUI É RAVENS CARALHOOO
Ah yes, good competitive football with fans back. This is what I like to see.
LAMAR GOATED
Thank the football gods this game had fans
What a great game !  Ravens had to play from behind which was better for them this time around . Don’t ever say he can’t come back from behind  to win  ! He beat the greatest player on earth ! LFG#RavensFlock!!!
THE JETS SUCK!!! I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS RAVENS CHIEFS HIGHLIGHTS, IF YOU'RE TEAM SUCKS LIKE THIS, YOU LOSE YOUR BRAIN
Very impressive #8…that first interception  had me shook 💪🏽💪🏽
Imagine how high scoring this game would've been if both teams went up-tempo like they do in college. It could've reached 100+ points. I just wish NFL teams had the guts to run up tempo but I guess they like to waste time for some reason.
Lamar Jackson almost won the game without a lick of defense. We needed a miracle and we got it.
When Lamar Jackson is running being a playmaker the offense looks good. Great win for Ravens
And the chiefs were talkin 20-0,already got their hearts crushed in week 2.
Imagine someone calls you Honeybadger as a joke in 7th grade and then the whole world knows you by that nickname your entire life wtf
What a defining moment for a team with injuries everywhere in a game that no one  thought they would win. They are truly built different!!
So you saying that the raider or better than the cheifs
Can’t wait to hear the aftermath of Lamar flipping into the endzone on Mic’d up😂😂
That was a close game but gg chiefs
Might not have been the Best game today; however, it was the most Fun.
Don’t tell me about no other young QB in the league other than Mahomes before you bring up Lamar’s name. He’s better than Kyler,Josh Allen; Herbert and anyone else until further notice
I love how much they praise the chiefs just to get clapped
I’m a ravens fan and I picked them to lose. Great game by Lamar despite the stat line
Hi
We smoking that Chiefs pack tonight baby
Lol Lamar is overrted. You can't reach a super bowl with a RB as your leader. He can't even throw
The Chiefs allowed 251 rushing yards... yikes 😬
That ending to the game was seriously insane!! I did not expect that at all!! Kudos to the Ravens! They never gave up and they defeated the Chiefs! To the Ravens, I am so impressed by your win!!
How do the ravens loose to the raiders then beat the chiefs ?
Thank you Ravens for your service. You’ve done the rest of AFC West a solid tonight.
This is why we love Football!!!
I knew this was gonna be a close game!
Best season
We finally beat the Chiefs. Go Ravens!!!
Lamar for another MVP
Definitely game of the year for sure at least for now , there’s going to be some tough competition this season tho
Have you any idea how badly I needed this win tonight
It’s such a good game, Go Raven! 🏈😎
RAVENS! As a Raider fan I know we didn't get along last week, but I love you guys.
Lamar finally gets his revenge on Mahomes.
Raiders run the West ☠☠
Two top 5 qbs going at it love Action Jackson much respect to Mahomes
LMAO Patrick MaFraud is washed up and needs to retire. Chiefs are overrated and garbage and I love it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm sooooooo happy right now! GG chief fans....hell of a game! Both raven games have been super stressful!
This game was so rigged the flags on mathieu
As a Broncos fan, watching KC choke like that is just music to my ears.
CEH is the biggest choke artist in the NFL right behind Matt Ryan
There goes chances for undefeated season
Game of the year😩
Chiefs should have won but Clyde sold so hard the ravens had no chance in stopping the chiefs but obviously sometging had to happen so that lamar can finally win bs game
Lamar Jackson’s win against Kansas City  “It’s about damn time.” What a game tonight
2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BALTIMORE RAVENS BEATS 2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION KC CHIEFS
The primetime games this season have been mostly really good so far, not sure about lions and packers tomorrow night 😂😂😂
Let me count the ways that they will still find a reason to disrespect Lamar Jackson. I wonder who will have the worst take.
Mahomes is obviously a better passer but I'd love to see Lamar with Hill and kelce and hardman
KC defense is it's own kryptonite
We’re going 1-15 with that defense.
Superman BEAT his Kryptonite!!!!!!!!!
Great game
Great game as the Ravens nevermore the Chiefs. The NFL has had sooo many exciting games so far this season. Hope it continues.
What's scary about this Ravens team is that they gifted KC 7 and an Extra possession at the start of the game and they still won. The Browns played perfect but 1 turnover lost them the game. Ravens will be the main Chiefs rival in the Mahomes era
What a sweet win!
I actually predicted the Ravens to win this game lol.  The Browns proved to the world that the Chiefs were vulnerable, and the Ravens capitalized on it.  Ravens, well played.  You guys did the NFL a favor.  From a Browns fan Great Job 👍.  You guys proved many people wrong today.
With this defense KC ain't wining s*** this year, make Freeman look like a rookie😂 have over 400 rushing yards on them First 2 games, Spags might be good but he's not getting the job done, Chiefs need bigger bodies in secondary, pass rush everything, this is what will happen you will slowly see it, if teams know they can run and score at will who cares if you can throw it down field
I turned off this game earlier... then got a phone  alert when ravens were down 6...   OMG...
What a game. Both teams never quit.
It's about time, DAMN!
One of the best games I’ve seen this year. Lamar Jackson played better tonight despite the 2 picks thrown to Ty Mathieu, the offensive line accepted the challenge and the defense was able to stave off the rally late, and Odafe Oweh deserves a game ball for that critical forced fumble and recovery. Great win by the Ravens
2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HEARTBROKEN 💔 😭 13:38
This win came with an injury plague team
Go Ravens! Lamar haters be quiet 😏🤫😈
What a game! I thought it was just gonna be an easy win for the chiefs but Lamar proved me wrong
Prime time has been insane so far this year
*He’s a runningback* haters real quiet now
GAME OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE LETS GO LAGOAT JACKSON
Not bad for a running back. Congrats Lamar, you earned it
Game of the year
Lamars flip into the end zone was amazing 😂😂😂
Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Lamar Jackson doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing!
I'm glad that the chiefs lost crushed their hopes for undefeated
instant classic
Early
The KC RB that fumbled prob won’t sleep for a week. How do you hold the ball so loosely???
Lamar Jackson hands Mahomes his 1st loss in September.
That’s probably one of the best games Lamar’s played in his career despite the bad start he showed showed some real guts this game
This whole game was crazy from start to finish 🤦🏿‍♂️ how many heart attacks did the fans of both teams receive tonight? 🤔
2021 season is off to a great start. Hell of a game.
Lol Stephen a smith trying to find a way to praise the ravens without completing Lamar Jackson
Wasn't pretty. But Ravens Flock!!!!!!!!!!!!
LAMAR IS BEING CONTROLLED BY GOD RIGHT NOW 🔥🔥🔥🤣💯💪🏽
Respect to Mahomes though, i love KC vs BAL
This was such a good game besides the unnecessary flags on both side of the team
Lamar said he was gonna come into this game ready and prepared, he wasn’t lying
Chiefs will choke.
I thought chiefs won for a fact, when I saw we (Chiefs) get fumbled, I told my dad to turn off that damn thing, I was sad, & mad.
Leggggo
Play Like A Raven‼️🖤😈 On To Lions
Chiefs fan, what a great game from the Ravens well deserved win from you guys, but Clyde bro you fumbling the football 😪😔😔
What a big play from the Baltimore defense to strip the ball from the Chiefs RB for the Ravens to run out the clock. Big win for Baltimore.
Oh no Lamar Haters where did you go? Your mom's basement? Come on I wanna hear those jokes?
Mahomes’ first pick AND first loss in September 👀
Wow what a game from Lamar Jackson. He made up for the bad defense #RavensFlock
BUST
Use me as the Jets winning the Superbowl button 🙌🏽
There’s been like 5 games of the year so far lol
1-1 boys let's go
Insane game lmao
There’s a new game of year each week
OWEH
Finally electric Lamar beats Mahomes!!! What a hell of a game!!!
LMAO y'all didn't even post the fumble yet but when mahomes scored y'all posted it within minutes.....Y'all don't even hide it anymore
Isn’t it wild how the Ravens already have TWO Game of the Year candidates to begin the season?
Lamar Jackson showed he's the REAL DEAL. That's why he's the MVP. 15 players on IR and NO EXCUSES #RavensFlock
In conclusion...defense is an illusion
Wowwweww congrats Ravens 🎉🎉
I’m so happy that Lamar has finally beaten the Chiefs, he played brilliant!💯
lamar god
Someone rescue Hill after today 😞
83% of America picked the chiefs to win this game tonight LMAOOOOOOOOOO
GAME OF THE YEAR ( so far )
Lamar and Mahomes both goated for this one! 🐐🐐
I had the Ravens in an upset on the preview video. Yall better quit playing with Lamar Jackson. He's that guy
Thank you Ravens
What a game
DONT WRITE US OUT
GO RAVENS!!! Great game chiefs, we’ll see you again
Let’s go
Chiefs: Bayern Munich!  Ravens: Aston Villa!
Ravens
🤯
Ravens despite their injuries could easily be 2-0. Remember the Raiders needed a 50+ FG just to force OT
The chief’s brought back the 2018 defense way to go I swear they only play defense when they feel like it
