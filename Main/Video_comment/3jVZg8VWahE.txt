Wish there were more foundation shades for light medium olive green skin. I'm almost 30 and still haven't found a foundation for me... I've tried everything. Beginning to lose hope
Can you do a minimal hair growth routine based on the Australian market? Some of the products you recommend I haven't been able to find in Australia like the Pantene miracle rescue mist. They only just brought in the miracle rescue conditioner and mask. I cant find the OGX mist either, just their other products. So yeah, pretty pleasssss <3
I know he’s controversial but I swear he seems like he’d be the nicest person in real life.
Jeff torna a fare questi video per noi...tu sei fantastico, iconico e ci manchi!!! ❤❤❤
YOU LOOK LIKE SILVER SQUIDWARD WITH A HITLER HAIRCUT
healing, growing inside and out  🥺love u jeffree #og💗💗
Dude ... Doll ... you lost me at powder. NO! That foundation is stunning without. No powder!

Lady gaga, we love her! Haus labs, we love it!

Hi does anyone wanna buy original oil paintings or customized paintings please let me know I'm a 22 years old women artist who have won multiple national and international awards and certificates also got featured in news articles and many of my paintings are in holy places all these things just got me fame but 0 income, my parents are sick and I've some health issues too as a stubborn kid i choose passion over everything and now struggling to live and pay monthly bills
Jeffree… a tom ford eye brow gel? Maybelline has a great $8 option 😂
I really miss your videos just sit downs and makeup I hope one day when your ready we can get more of those x
❤❤❤❤❤
After I bought that foundation I started having allergy reactions to a lot of eye shadows brand like Mac .  I really won’t recommend this foundation to no one .
If you acted like a man you’d be so hot.
Was für ein schönes Gesicht er hat!
Hiiii ✌️ Jeffree I kinda low key MISS your hair cut here... It made you look like a BOSS.. killin' it YO 😎😇😍🥰 hottie hottie 😜😜🥰🥰😍😍🌻🌻🌹🌹🥳🥳💄💄💯💯💓💓
JEFFREE PLEASE CHECK ON EUGENIA. FREE HER FROM HER MOM IF YOU CAN
I hope Jeffree can do these videos again. 😢
i miss this so much JEFFREE COME BACKKK
Anyone in 2025?
So much swearing.   Can we cool it on the swearing
I bought this foundation after watching this review, and wow, I love it!  A half a pump blended with an Artis oval 7 brush gives me great coverage and staying power.  I can work a 12 hour shift and workout afterwards and it's still there.  It's still true to the color, it hasn't melted off, and it hasn't settled into the fine lines of the face.  The concealer is exceptional too.  The highlighter gives the skin a beautiful glow and it doesn't cake at the end of the day.
You realize that she knows nothing about the make up… or chemistry
Come back jefree star
On his elf foundation video I waited n waited n he never came back on after 5/7 hours n told us if it held up
Jamie Lee Curtis . I like his no brow look
I don’t like the brows! I always liked that he was so different n did his own thing n it looked so good
https://youtu.be/IeL9t6wFElg?si=U2yvAfYLvoWtNzl0
I’m with Jeffrey, I WAS SHOOK! It looked like my skin just 5 times better with no imperfections! ❤❤❤❤
a lot of people don't realize this man is 39 now...he doesn't age. Love him or hate him, the man has good age defying genes. He don't even need make up!
Jeffrey, I am a woman with PCOS and I have had to shave my face like a man forever.  I have a problem with foundations setting in and showing that I shave.  How does this foundation do where you shave?
I cant stand your hair like that you look like a Karen
Why does my heart feel so broken 😢 I miss you regular content and I miss your vlogs. I miss seeing your pombabies run around. I miss your positivity. Ugh come back!
I love it!!! Now I want to buy the foundation and powder ❤ omgahh I stress over my shade finder part.. Jeffery it looks amazing ❤
Makeup looks flawless ❤
You're the most goddess of the internet the one and only, love u 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I was wondering if you would do a Jeffree Star approved for flower knows makeup? Their makeup looks super pretty and is supposed to be really good.
Lucie Arnaz looks like a bird to Kristen. She scares her.
I just bought this foundation yesterday and I love it!
I miss J⭐️ reviews 😢 who else can we trust
Damn, I stopped watching Jeffree for years and now I came back to watch his vids and he has an eyebrows now 😂
I definitely wanna slap the shit out of you……BECAUSE IT LOOKS FLAWLESS😂!!!!
What is this haircut 😢 Last time i saw his videos 5 years ago he had long hair and no eyebrows what happend to him  He now look like ken mixed with kim k mother
I can't be only 1 putting jeffree star's videos in background while organizing n decluttering my closets n makeup drawers🐣
I don't normally get handheld mirrors but that cleaver mirror is GLORIOUS AND I WANT ONEA
I miss jeffree star so much. I started following jeffree a decade ago when he was in his myspace era and really followed him when he came on youtube with his neon pink hair. I hate that he went thru life and had to take a long break because life was lifing. Im so happy he is coming back slowly at a time because the beauty community got too toxic. But so happy to see you again, please come back with your reviews. ❤ cant wait to see what you drop for us. If there are haters out there, keep viewing becaus more views means we get more content. Ty
okay but the nails💅💜
Omggg who knows the name of the song at 10:35
I love you but this haircut is not it you look like kris Jenner
AZ advised me to use a gentle, non-stripping cleanser to remove makeup and maintain my skin’s natural balance.
I wish he still did these 😢
Jeffrey Star . I love your makeup it is so AMAZING. I got my order today and yesterday and I couldn’t wait to open it when I seen my PINk boxes In the mail . I was so excited . I got the liquid Blush and the lip gloss for free and the Beautiful eyeshadow with also a free gift. Your makeup is amazing . And I love watching your videos. And thank you so much for making the best makeup I have ever tried.
Just found your channel...yeah i'm way behind but hell, i'm old what can i day! But i did my research and was pleasantly surprised at how everyone said you were straight forward, blunt and told the truth about products so i adore anyone like that. Very refreshing in this day and age. Is there any foundation or beauty products that you have tried that's affordable to us older folks on set incomes? I mean i would love to have that foundation but i'd have to go without eating a few days to buy it! 😂 I do absolutely love your channel and so damn glad i found it!!
The existence of this channel proves that majority of man"kind" is not even "humans" theyre all just 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
Colored contact link pleaseeee
no bc i got that foundation and when i was at Sephora it looked so nice on me but when i tried it at home again tell me why i looked like annoying orange
Wow Jefree you REALLY look amazing.....honestly! You are very good looking with or without make up but for real sir YOU have never looked better!! I'm 50 yrs old and have no clue how ro do my make up and haven't explored what I'd look like with "proper" male up on...I live in Canada but I'd LOVE to be able to have you do my make up and teach me what I should be using!! But bitch I know you're busy af...so I know it's not about ro happen buuuut how cool would that be??!! Looooooove to see you happier and looking more fierce than ever!! Much love from Canada ❤
Когда то в далеком ... училась краситься по его видео. Сейчас решила посмотреть есть ли он еще на ютюб. Жаль, что не могу видеть его чаще. Притягательный мужчина.
Miss your videos Jeffrey but I hope you are living your best life in privacy. You carry the beauty influencer YouTube community, feels so blah without you especially in this “clean” makeup era. Your looks always give me the perfect amount of drama that my brain chemistry requires.
We’ve missed you!!
I know this is an old video, but have you heard of Tiger grass serum…? What do you think?
You look so much healthier!
🤍
Jeffree is about to roast
It blends like a dream ❤
I have missed Jeffree's reviews. Jefree is looking Fabulous ❤❤❤
I knew you looked absolutely stunning !!!!!!!!!!!! I love to see you so healthy it almost makes me wanna cry

One of these days, Jeffree should review makeup off amazon makeup palettes to see if it's Jeffree Star approved. Some of them are drugstore type, some are straight from China, some are hit and super miss.
big fan of your work in blood on the dance floor keep it up :D
5 chance also😅
the old packaging was so tacky! i love this new look ❤
❤
This foundationd looks absolutely fricking ahmazing ;o

Jeffrey come back!!! I NEED a new review!!
I want that meat cleaver mirror!
I just came back to this videos because literally miss the old YouTube
"are nye ca" 🤣 🩷
How does the setting powder not go on messy with a damp beauty blender? I am going to experiment with this. I like to have a dry feeling face after doing my makeup but i end up looking cakey because of it and my foundation cracks alot. I have so much too learn. Think i need to rewatch all of jeffrees videos lol
I'd like to try this foundation!
I LOVE jeffri
COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
Im 28 and I have HORRIBLE skin😢 I really hope Jeffree Star never becomes like those tik tok influencers with the fake reviews😒 His reviews are one of the few I trust❤
I LOVE YOU! Not only did you teach me what makeup is worth buying on the market you've also taught me how to apply it! I know that there are so so many tutorials out there but your videos are the ones that gave me confidence in knowing how to do it myself just by watching you so thank you so much ❣️!!
I love the kitchen music in the background 😂😂❤ too cute and love this review!
lol I was trying to figure out what was new about him. EYEBROWS!
I miss your videos a lot. Hope all is well with you
You look so beautiful right now. I love that you look and sound so healthy. You need to be the next Betty white and live forever!!
Always LOVE and trust your reviews. I tried the house labs concealer in store and it also looks amazing. Have u tried it?
Jefree Star is not speaking out for the lgtbq narrative, he is taking someone elses script to keep benefiting his pockets and killing our future in general on purpose. We are pansexual and we do not support any form of his way of speaking about pansexuality. As someone coming from a community where we have to be continously speaking due to the amount of predators that try to hide behind our doors is really sad. We are commenting because we dont want kids getting hurt due to our innacountability to speak up and hold Jeffrey Star accountable for his aid and refuging of these predators within the lgtbq community. We are also our own line of defense, we exist and we are not powerless or hopeless of hope less. To be able to perceive them through the Spirit, Mind, Body, Soul, Telepathically, Energetically, 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, 9D, 10D, 11D, 12D, and even 13D for comical reason or purposes and yall chose to make this unaccountable comments due to being guilty in adding such disrespectful community.
how come this idiot clown shane has more subscribers than Jeff???
I love your reviews, you really tell the truth about the products and I like how expressive you are ❤️
❤❤❤❤
He's glowing ❤❤❤ You JS are so badass
My question is how much does it cost on average per shade of foundation.
Welcome back!!! Missed you here, Jeffree! ❤
I seriously LOVVVVVE this new, healthy, radiant, sun-kissed, well-cared for Jeffree ❤❤❤ SO happy for you!!
What the F..k is this??😨😨 Million subscribers for that thing??🤣🤣
Love your brows! 🙌
With a brush or blender?
I want long, regular videos from Jeffree again :(
What I love about your videos is that they are so well done.  Your craft of makeup is so spectacular.  It is no wonder you are so incredibly successful.

Everytime someone chooses to get their lip fillers dissolved they end up looking years younger. I can’t wait for the day people start actually realizing how goofy and aging successive fillers really look
Hi babe what is your response to  - NY Times in August of 22 put out an article , “ The days of full coverage foundation are dead “ .  Vogue also put one out Jan 2023. ✨✨✨✨
I freakinqqqqq loveeeeeee YOU
I missed this. I'm not into the tictok. I miss the long jeffee videos 😢❤
Hello Jeffrey, I know I am late in the game. BUT.....I've followed you and enjoying your videos. Love your personality and your dedication to reviewing all the makeup in the world! Including dollar tree! Can't wait to see what else you create. Take care and have a wonderful day!
OK so I have a question and everyone tells me something different I have originally oily skin what is the best primer in good foundation, combo, drugstore, and namebrand?
Growth and Maturity is becoming of you! You wear it well! I am proud of you and you look so good! I love this new Jeffree Star! I have resubscribed.

And please, stop saying bitch every second- it’s ruuuuul tired 🥱
I literally can’t believe you spoke to your poor fan that way- Legit hope your career crashes and burns now… It was just some nice person trying to catch a break and get by. Why do you care?!?! I actually started crying when I read what you said - so cruel-  Also, everyone knows LadyGaga hates Bullies. I hope she cancels your mean ass. Absolutely unforgivable- You’re a disgrace- Hey LadyGaga! Go find the fan he did this too and make him/her/them the star! Cut this jerk loose! He’s a monster and not one of your good little monsters either… For Shame Jeffree…
Please upload more videos please
Wow!!!! Jeffrey is a model handsome looking man! 👍👍👍👍
Does anyone know what highlighter Jeffree has on? I LOVE how natural yet highlighting it looks. It's beautiful!
Wow, Im going to sound like a cringey kiss -up ....however....I just  gotta say you look good in any hairstyle, nake up or no makeup.   The cosmetics you review look  fantastic in part of formulation but a larger part  is  YOUR flawless COMPLEXION.    Those compamies  get an awful lot of free press because of you.  Hope they are taking good care of you in return.
Jeffree I love that you are so happy you deserve it❤️ getting sunshine, yummy food, and healthy friends that love you does wonders
Imagine if new viewers didn’t know that was a mirror 💀 🔪
Hi star ✨😊they are like bashees😊😅😂❤
can you review sk2 skincare too?
What shade was used?
I miss him 😢 😪 😔 😞 😕
Please come back to youtube
You look beautiful ❤
Jeffree serving some Twink energy. LUVS IT ❤
You look so good in tan skin omg 😍
Now do Gwen Stefani’s makeup 🎉 just saw her on drew Barrymore show
The mirrow in shape of the hatchet  knife ... I love it
Low-key crazy how Shane, Jeffree, James Charles or Tati never recovered from 2020. That was their peak, and nobody gives a fuck about them anymore
Why are u no longer making many videos since the move?
I bought that for my girlfriend and she died
Thank you for bringing back makeup reviews ❤ your realness is what I need in my life
Hear me out
Jeffree with brows and short hair? I’m shook
Hiii
suddenly he looks like kris jenner but young
He looks better without make up  😂
The last makeup review 😭
I need need your foundation ❤ make it full coverage … queen here lives for your existence and am thankful you exist .. the world needs your energy 🎉
I LIVE for Jeffree Star makeup reviews! I’m a budgeting teacher so it’s nice to know what not to waste my money on. I’d love to see him review some of these lash extension companies (lashify, urbandollz, lilac st) that claim they’re waterproof and won’t come off.
Missed you. Glad you’re doing good. You deserve it.
ur getting more beautiful handsome i dunno but i am hooked again
Greetings from California. Great make-up reviews, Jefree Star. Happy holidays from our channel: Australian Parakeets Stars
Honestly this is the best your skin has looked ❤
The eyebrows threw me off tbh lol
You look AMAZING
So awesome 🤗🥰🤩 your lips the eyebrows you look so amazing and i swear you seem more happier and more at peace and just look so vibrant and refreshed and I see the difference in you! It’s really wonderful! 🤗🥰💖💖
Tbh, Jeffree star is cringe in my opinion, but it’s amazing how he made a bunch of products that work for an majority of people, but I also hate how it’s all pink, but overall him himself is just  cringe
you should try tresluce beauty by becky g
My favorite foundation ever!
I love you and your program, I wish you always and forever to be as you are.  is Brilliant❤❤❤❤

Jeffree please bring lady gaga on your youtube channel and make to her a makeup 😍♥️
I adore you, and I miss your ability to cock your eyebrow. Please take a botox detox. Your eyebrows and lips look amazing, though. It's awesome to see how naturally beautiful you are!
YOU ARE SO DELUXE MAMONA, QUEEN REVIEWS QUEEN 🧄 the ☂️, 🧂🍵☂️ and who 💦.
Yeah he seems  cool
Appreciate the honesty on quality versus price point!

I swear to god if I seen him and he asked me how his foundation looks, I'd probably die. lol I have loved Jeffree since like 2008, this is so great.
New sub, Jeffrey you are super addicting ❤
Love your brows, love that you dissolved your filler. You look great! The foundation looks beautiful on you.
Good for u my friend 💕💕💕

Yo I didn’t watch Jeffree star for so long and now he has fucking eyebrows

How have I only just started watching you. Gorgeous and funny, love ya x
Jefree is so crazy 😂 I love him 😂
Foundation on or not, you are one the most beautiful people on earth.
the Haus Labs liquid foundation and the loose powder looked so great on you ❤
Hey I'm going to get a bottle choosing a shade now
Gorg💗
I can't even explain how happy it makes me that Jeffree is into his more natural look lately. It's like the light that I never knew I needed, blended in with his classic Hollywood look. Just looks stunning as usual, but in a more soul satisfying way. 🤍
Came back to check on js and wow he looks more healthy and natural. He looks like himself and I love it! I could cry. 😢 I pray for the best for jeffree.
Gay
I literally just finished watching one of his old vid and decided to check in his new videos, he looks so different now, he looks so healthy and fresh
Jeffree is actually such an icon. Happy to see you thriving and living your best life in Wyoming
❤❤❤Yasss 😊 I am so happy to see Jeffree getting his life!  The girl is FLAWLESS 🤯💝👌
Missed you !!! Love your reviews! You are my all time favorite !!!
Wyoming!!!  Neighbors with Kanye?  Glad your back Jeffree
I always like his reviews. Very honest ❤
I saw the rode makeup I never knew it was that bad for you to review
i haf never heard of you, until a TV show here in thd Netherlands about dramageddon 1 and 2. I think you all need a dose of dutch smartness and feet on the ground. you seem a lovely person, so include somebody to avoid these things. fighting is never ok.
I am going to wait for my summer skin to come in and try this! 😍 You are literally glowing!
jeffrees reviews will always be the best, so honest and entertaining✨
I nearly thought you had a cleaver.
I need this foundation 😮
Lol. The eyebrows is the first thing I noticed!! Keep living your best life
I definitely miss your reviews.. nice seeing you review this. And the foundation really looks good
You look gorgeous! You have always looked beautiful, but I am in love with new healthy you! I think this look is my favorite. Cheers to health journeys!! Because we are worth it!

Missed you!!!
Jeffrey hi! I’m from the Philippines and taking care of my 86 year old mother. I’m not really good in putting her makeup but one must say that watching your videos makes things easier for me.  Would love to see you make a video about how to put makeup for elderly women and what best practices and techniques when dealing with seniors. Thankfully Jojo from the Philippines!❤❤
Can you do a review with a full face of pixie makeup?!
Gorgeous
can anybody tell me what is the name of the liquid eye shadow seein on this video from Jeffrey cosmetics it look like a rose peachy
Miss your reviews, too babe ❤️🙏😂👼🏻🤘🏻. Im Donna in Baltimore; 55, & i ve Love you; your cosmetics, skincare, and Trut your reviews . Love it❤️🙏👼🏻. Take Care
So Happy You’re Back, Jeffree ❤️🙏🙏. Oh. Do meA favor.  Put that little you tuber wanna be Mikala, whatever; . Put Her In Her. Place; Really.❤️🙏👼🏻😂🔥. Does she know wtf& who tf; she’s dealing With😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤘🏻😂😂😂😂😂
I’m sorry to say but your orange have seen you much better
😊😊
I didn't like you before. I sorta kinda watched some of your videos. You've matured a lot. Really enjoying your content.
Jefree's make-up reviews are the only ones I trust and watch. Everyone else, sorry. You're not Jefree Star.
Have not watched a video from him in a while
I love the mirror :0)
Can you do makeup by mario review?
Mesmerizing , I don’t even use foundation…I like this planet
I am looking for a range of foundation which maybe available in my country. The Valentino looks good but not available here sadly.
New.follower of Jeffery.  No idea bout his history.  Don't know.and do not give a shit. This guy - will give u a straight up dead honest review. He is not paid. He doesn't try to hide whether they are promoting him by putting it in tiny writing at the bottom that mo one reads , or hide it beind the platform logos.  I'm sick of fake-ass influences. No integrity.Unsubscribed from all.of them. I want someone to tell me the truth only. Don't sell me a shit product and waste my timr and money. Im angry bcoz it's VERY easy to do this - not showing how much u had to put on/correct it, how easy to apply , filters then hides everything.  Fuck that shit. U use a filter and try to sell me products that have been staged to look they are so miraculous? Fuck that. I want to know the absolute brutal truth. They've wasted enough of our money and time on this crap for big brands.  I'm thrilled for lady gaga - now that is someone who I am on board with - Intelligent skin makeup that actually delivers 👏. Thankyou for this superb review Jeffery.  I'm a new fan!
Your honesty 🥺❤
I sometimes give you shit, but in all honesty I’m SO GLAD UR BACK 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gained weight? Ok. Lips look better now.
❤
Can I just say I’m gagging over your nails omg 🥵😍💚 so beautiful ❤
come backkk we need moreee
hi there
BUTCH TIK TOK IS BANNED HERE WE NEED YOU IN YOUTUBE
Haven’t seen jeffree in a minute. Damn who is she nowww?? I love the new vibe.
Thank you!!! I’m going to buy it now and your concealer ❤❤
i love u
please transfer me 4000 dollars to the card I am from Kazakhstan you could help me cool write the answer
I'm a 50 year old bag and just started to dab in makeup...I love you omg so real and I love that I can trust your options on brands.Makeup in Canada is very expensive and I know whe. You give a Jeffery Star approve that item is going to be amazing.Love you so much ❤❤
♥️
I love this foundation on my dry skin 😍
Has Jeffree done jones road yet?
The foundation is amazing 👏🏾 and he is right about the shades. I work at Sephora and when I am color matching a client to their shade it does take me a little longer to find it because there are so many different undertones in the shades. Which isn’t a bad things it’s great because it is inclusive but, it does take a couple tries before finding that perfect shade. And I really wish Jeffree test the whole collection. I would’ve like to seen the bronzer and the blush along with the lip and eye products. It’s so colorful and diverse I think he would’ve created a really nice look that pops. Haus Labs Approved 👏🏾
Crypt keeper ass lookin; heifer with widows peeks says what?
the brown streak 😂😂😂 too relatable
Can you do a makeup video for beginners . I have no idea what I’m doing or what I need
Love you and your honest reviews, love your fine lines makes you look like a real person. And I LOVE that you grew your brows!

So glad I just watched this bc I’m ready to try a new foundation and I KNOW Jefferee isn’t going to lie to us. He’s actually the only influencer I’ll believe now

The fact that Jeffree star is so filthy fucking rich that he genuinely doesn’t even need to be on YouTube anymore but the fact that he is just shows how much he really has changed and how he’s really working on himself and trying to get back to what he loves
❤❤❤

I was here for the makeup,  but I staid for  the evolved Jeffree.  I adore , you embracing yourself in a more natural way.  The look you chose was soft and complimented your skin tone perfectly.   It's nice to see you happy and healthy.
I haven’t seen you in awhile & you look so healthy & gorgeous!  I love the haircut and eyebrows!!

"kind of plastic but a little real" LOL
Girl! We missed you so damn much. You look stunninggggg!!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
How could they be so chill around you? I’d be fan girling, and I’d scream and faint. Probably hit my head on the way down. Get a TBI.
Jeffree can you review Glossier ?!???! so curious what you think
I’m so obsessed with how you’re mixing that bottle and still talking 🤣
Jeffree, I really miss you GRWM that you use to do back in the day. But I am loving the new you!!!!
U look better than ever
Omg Jeffrey has eye brows why is no one talking about this. Scandal jk jk love you my Queen
Keep saying bitch....learn another word

Awwwwww it’s soooo nice to see you on YouTube ❤❤❤❤
Thank you for the honest review! The foundation is 🔥
Love seing you around on YT again, love ya <3
Love you so happy for you dear
Don't even wear make up but have I watched every video about make up Jefree's made? Yep
This is such a wonderful treat 🧁🍡🍬 I feel like it's pre-pandemic & I'm drooling over the newest JSC creations!! Listen, I'm not a fan of LG. It's not my aesthetic - the music, the costumes, the make-up, the videos - none of it. I will give credit where credit is due, and why not?!! With all her money and resources the least she could do is come up with a decent product IJS. Overall I'm just happy to be watching a Jeffree video ✌️🧡🌈
It’s the Alfa 7 playing In the back for Me LMAOOOOO. . ‘Im buying the foundation thank you jefree keep  glowinnnn it looks good on u!
PLS REVIEW RARE BEAUTY PRODUCTS 😭😭😭
You look so beautiful 🤗
JEFFREEY STAR is an icon, bro⭐

You seem happier and more authentic! Than ever ! Wyoming suits you! Stay humble

So happy that your back the Real OG ❤
You look so much healthier and happy.😊 missed your honest makeup reviews no body does it like Jeffree does and you are good at what you do.
I love your new glow, Jeffree. Keep slaying!
Jeffree, I've been under a rock for awhile, but I am back. One thing I can say, YOU LOOK AMAZING!!!! Obviously, Wyoming agrees with you. I've never seen you look more stunning.
💙💙
You look amazing, Jeffree! Keep doing whatever it is you’re doing! 💖
It feels like 2017 again
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER TRIED FKN WITH JEFFREE HAS EVER PROSPERED ! TEAM JEFFREE PERIOD!
Can't stand this guy he thinks he's all that his opinion means nothing to me
That mirror though…..❤
I’m going to say it: peach is your color! Oh my sweet cream, you look gorge!
Just discovered your makeup reviews and I’m straight obsessed! Please, bitch, what is the best medium coverage for dryish super fair skin - like redhead fair? Redheads are people too! 😂

Yk me and I’m sure others want you to please try the new elf foundation😢
Jeffree you look slammin’ Love U 😘
<3
You’re so cute! I just love you so much 💗 I’m so happy you’re back and looking healthier than ever 🤍🦋☺️
Review SHEIN make up
You look great n heathy bby ❤
He looks so stunning!!! And where are his contacts froom??
You look gorgeous love the healthy changes! 2:32
I NEED THIS
Baby, just reminding you to use your SPF daily, I don’t want to see bitch wrinkle prematurely !!
JEFFREE!!! I saw a dream. In that dream I bought a Jeffree Star product that I cannot stop thinking about, because I NEED IT. The problem is, that product does not exist yet. It was a chapstick. But it was not any basic ass chapstick... In the dream you gave me what looked lika a jumbo sized lipstick, almost as big as a deodorant, but it was a chapstick. It was a Jeffree Star iconic Pink coloured case, and I opened it. It smelled like minty fruits or something, and I applied it to my chapped ass dry ass lips and it felt like buttery goodness and the main thing I remember was that it had a cooling effect, like Carmex does, and it felt sooo good. I WOULD BUY HUNDREDS OF THEM IF YOU MADE THEM. Hope you find this comment. 💖💖💖
Its been forever sence u have posted r u ok!!❤️😊
My mom likes you concealer
I NEED MORE REVIEWS PLEASE
WHO IS SHE?!?! Overjoyed to see fresh dewey skin, and bright eyes! 😭😍 I've never seen a healthier Jeff. Please delete if I overstep...(but since you brought it up...)😶‍🌫️ I  struggle with ED, and your weight was concerning. I'm glad you've gained. Women talk about their struggles more. Men are often led to believe they CAN'T. So they suffer quietly, obviously, OPENLY... and people pretend not to see because it makes THEM more comfortable. It makes me comfortable to see people healing, truly living. ❤️
Bitch we missed youuuuuuuu❤❤❤❤
You look so healthy!! So amazing what changing your environment does. So happy for you jeffree!
Shocked with how good you look! ❤️
Oh my goddess Jeffree! You are simply glowing. You look so healthy and happy. We love to see it. ❤
Love you JS ... her makeup nope . It's greasy, and clumbs up later. Not good
Can't believe I've only just found your channel, you're sooo gorgeous 😍 Can't wait to see more of your content in my feed
FINALLYYYYYYY!!!!!! MY JEFFREE BABY IS BACK! I NEED YOU IN MY BEAUTY WORLD!
This is suck!! How a man thinks he can be a woman! This is a big sin in every religion people please wake up the end is near!
Not la raza with the gits in the kitchen 🤣🫶🏼 10:29
Missing you so much on YouTube!!! I don’t watch ducking tiktock… please come back to YouTube with long content for your old school fans 🥹🙏🏻❤️✨🌹✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️

Love how you are looking, skin color, weight, those pounds are making u look very pretty! More natural looking
You look beautiful shining and healthy ❤❤❤
I just miss u so much on YouTube ❤️😍❤
OMG bitch welcome back queen all I have to say is the thank you for coming back with reviews you are the ONLY person I trust doing reviews because I know you give 0 F's and are on no one's payroll except your own 😂 at least I know when you do a review it's going to be real and unbiased BUT honestly I would love you to start also doing reviews on smaller Indy brands like spoiled cosmetics, XNO , jealea cosmetics,smaller brands I do Makeup lives on Facebook and TT and would never ever lie to my followers Of course I am a nobody but you inspire me even being broke I wouldn't lie because I wouldn't want that done to me love you girl
I got it through influenster, and it's lovely, but I definitely need to moisturize cause it did not like dry skin 😆
Ms Jeffrey Lynn entering her P!NK phase. I think it’s the haircut ❤
omg he went into the restaurant kitchen and asked how his makeup is
i miss watching jefree so muchhhh
I have not watched Jeff in over three years. I forgot how hilarious is but can we please talk about his damn wig please guys LMAO
Idk why but she's giving Kris Jenner/Kardashian vibes hard.
OMG I NEVER RAN SO FAST TO UR VIDEO WHEN I LEARN THERE WAS A MAKEUP REVIEW OUT
We love you here!! You look amazing!! 👏🏼💖💖💖💖
This New Jefree is so good. Slayyyy
Im sorry...what??!!! I need a hatchet mirror!!!!
Jefree I see the Spirit of the Lord all over you!
That foundation is the best foundation Ive ever seen on you! Damn 😮 I wanna buy that but im broke
Yes back with YouTube reviews!!! Damn Jeffree looks good, absolutely love the eyebrows!!!
"No botox we can see some wrinkles, not even ashamed" Bitch what wrinkles? 😂❤
Hi
I love the adidas outfitz
What a treat! LOVE the new Jeffree 🥹 You look so happy and healthy! Miss your videos ❤
Good to see you back jeffree! Now I need to get that foundation! ❤
You somewhat remind me of Annie Lennox.   I think a nice gold earring would look good on you.
I want a radiant foundation from you
I think that people need to learn to be honest about something you love like you do.
You look great. Why did you ever behind the long hair. You are cute
Can you please do a review on shein foundation
Bathroom scene is giving gay Kris Jenner small slay
I love that you are showing your skin texture! A lot of makeup influencers often use filters and such to make makeup appear like a “filtered look” and that’s not a reality. It’s just not. Makeup sits on skin, not the other way around.
Its been a while hun and you look great and happier love it!
Ive gotta question. Why the fuck is he making himself look male again
Will there be a Makeup by Mario review in the future?
I love you so much ❤❤❤
plastic but real, bitch!
Jeffree should create a makeup foundation, I am sure that after everything he have try and the good ones and the bad ones, he would be the perfect person to create one for all skins. I would definitely buy it.
Wow he actually looks his gender here lmfao
Imagine talking shit and saying you’d never come back to YouTube as it’s “dead” 😂😂😂😂😂 clownnnn literally as your brand proves it
Forget the foundation.... GURRRRRL! Your NAILS tho! So freaking hot bitch!💚💚💚💚💚💚
What happened to your face? It looks like a mash-up of Bryanboy and Utica the drag queen
omg jeffree have you tried the IL MAKIAGE foundation? It is all over social media. They will basically send you a foundation + makeup brush for free and let you try if you like it. If you do, you get charged $45 If not, you can return it in 14 days. I tried it but It's not for me. The shade I got was too light and It felt dry. It would be interesting to know if it will work on yours.
Your skin looks FAB and I love the nails 💚
I love the new you!! You seem very happy. So glad for you!!
Glad you’re back doing reviews! You look great!!!
You look 100 BILLION x better without injections. The difference is dramatic in a good way. *Please Don’t Ever Inject Your Face Again.* I can’t even begin to describe how seriously good you look absent of injections. Plus, you’re promoting self-positivity for people who can’t get injections. But seriously, your face - it’s back to perfect.
um. idc what gaga releases i would never support her knowing what she is, what she isn’t. sad world. i wouldn’t expect to have seen jeffery supporting her knowing he knows about illuminati shit. this is hilarious
I miss u jeffreyyyyyy
I was actually waiting for your dinner clip/footage - wanted to see more of u.. but then i remembered this was a makeup review clip lol!
tsa loves them…. opening conversation starter. omg im dead girl

Giving Claire Underwood
Gosh, how I have missed your videos. I've been working my ass off so that doesn't help either but DAMN JEFFREE get your arse back over here!!!! Lol, Love the video of course! Looking good.
Laddyyyy Gaga mama
ar-NAY-ka   i fuckin lost it 😭
Thank you and Shane for getting me through Rehab. I'm in a transitional living facility now and I can't wait to get a job so I can buy your products!! Love ya ❤️❤️❤️❤️
we need the reviews on here babe
You are so prettyyyyy
Jeffree! You are looking soo good beautiful!
I haven’t seen you since you grew out your brows! They look great. I forgot how much I enjoy your videos 😅
I'm so glad to see you back bitch!!
let’s go ask someone random… enters the kitchen.
I was literally asking myself what was different about him but couldn’t pin point why it was then he said his eyebrows grew and i was like oh yeahhh
I need more of this. I miss watching REAL reviews of make up items. Pleasee post more on youtube than in Tiktok
Jeffree looks better then he ever has! So happy for him!
I love gaga and I bet this fondation was awesome but I tried her liquid eye liner and crayon liner duo and the liquid sucked. After it dried, it cracked on my lids. That was a year ago. Maybe I should try more of her stuff
Omg I didn’t even notice the brows until he mentioned it 2:54 that’s how you know he looks amazing with or without 🎉
I haven’t watched Jefree in 4 years or more and he honestly looks happier, healthier, and I feel like he’s changed a lot. I’m really happy for him.
hurry up n come out of retirement🦂🦂🦂🦂🦂 we rule
I love your wrinkle* and pride for them. Lol You’ve been stunning since MySpace let’s just get that straight. But appreciating our age and how far we’ve come and the fact that we’re here we survived, made it out alive….I love them wrinkles bitch yas
Your inner glow is gorgeous!! Happy looks good on you. ❤️❤️❤️
I love how he’s changing as a person ! and he’s living for natural !
Am I the only one that thought the girl said u look gay💀
I have missed your reviews sis!!! Omg I love you!! I love your honest reviews and value your opinion always like since what 2015-2016 or maybe even before that tbh
I will always trust Jeffree. I truly truly trust his opinions and value his commentary. I missed Jeffree!!
Looks like a paid add
Regardless of your wrinkles, your flawless! Thank you for always being real and honest in your reviews! Happy for your comeback!
thank Jeffery for always keeping it real!!
Can you do a review on rare beauty?
You are glowing and look so happy, I love that for you ❤ you are such a beautiful human being! I love your videos!
You look so much healthier! It’s weird seeing you with eyebrows 😂 The foundation looks very good on you!!
I’m so glad your back!
I feel like you lady Gaga would be absolute besties!!! And you guys both started ur careers with Akon I think that’s absolutely amazing!!
The only thing wrong with those powder blockers is when its almost out, good luck getting it out 😢 its hard as fk
Do people still care what this mentally ill Nazi says?
Who else is here after the whole mascara situation😂
I’m glad you’re back ❤🎉❤❤❤
I MISS U JEFFREE , please don’t become on of those YTB who only upload when they’re selling something
Kind of plastic but a little real 🤣🤣🤣. Im loving the new look at first I couldnt tell but then I was like oh that was your real brows lol. That foundation looks so good.
Omg you look like Kris Jenner!
We missed you here 🥺❤️❤️❤️
I’m the last person that isn’t on tik tok am I going to have to get on just for jeffree ?? Guess so 🤷🏻‍♀️ lol
Does anybody know what contacts Jeffree is wearing?
Jeffrey star with eyebrows! Wtf! Ptsd left me off the planet! Holy shit tho Jeffers, you look fucking fit with natural eyebrows!
I'm not sure I want to have a convo with TSA 😅
You look incredible & healthy ❣️
Hi Jeffree! Its been awhile, im waiting for more makeup reviews!
Its the nobleza de aguililla music for me 🇲🇽  When he’s asking people what they think of the foundation
Please do makeup by Mario foundation, blush and concealer 🫶🏻
OMG DO A RARE BEAUTY MAKEUP REVIEW I don't know who to trust some say they like it and it's so good but then there's these few people saying it's over hyped
wow been years since i watch JS video from his own channel..i like this new u dude, just stay out of drama, start loving people sincerely, never get on that high horse again..just be that usual freaky u like the first time u join youtube..i enjoy those days so much until u got to start all that JC n shane drama
FINALLY HE IS BACKKKKKKKKKK
Iv watched 400 reviews on this and THIS is the only one that made me buy it 😝
You look soooo happy and healthy and I love it so much 💖

Jeffree star coming back to do reviews next week to show these new influencers how it's done with transparency he bout to expose all these lieing hoes
I’m glad he had the fillers dissolved. He doesn’t need them at all. Natural is beautiful… well, that and a little make up 🤣🙌🏻
Ugh so so excited to see more of your reviews!!!!!
I freaking LOVE IT BABY!!!! LIVING FOR IT❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉
Love your review, that mini make up class was super cute and you look so amazing and WOW... 😘

Commenting because I just heard he is coming back with more makeup reviews REAL & RAW B*tches THE WORLD IS HEALING
BACK TO REVIEWSSSSS😮😮
Jeffree can you please review a bunch of setting sprays/ face mists
We love a little plastic and realism yessss!!😊😊
I’m excited to hear you’re doing reviews again! Yay! 🎉
I like this happy J*
Beautiful
Can’t WAIT to see you come back - I’m so tired of wasting money on influencers who clearly lie 😢
The vibe is off Jeffree I think the filming felt rushed and the editing was very different. Im not sure why but I feel something is wrong. I hope you’re okay
he looks better with his eyebrows
Plsssss do REM BEAUTY
love hearing you talk about this new chapter in your life❤️
You’re so gorgeous 😍🥰
Love that your back doing makeup reviews!!!!!🥰
You look so much happier & healthier I’m so happy for you
BEAUTIFUL
Let’s go ask someone random - I’m dead.
well im convinced. love him or hate him, 🌟 knows make up
the meat cleaver mirror... so iconic jeffree <3 LOL
You look so freaking healthy! Best you’ve looked in so long 🫶🏼♥️
I forgot jeffree rock the no eyebrow for years and I totally forgot about it until he mentioned it lol 🤭😂
WOOOOWW
I wish he would do more YouTube!!!! 😢😢😢
Love It and I love your nails and your eyes!I definitely need to got some of your new shadows!
seeing him with eyebrows is so weird
Yes bring back more makeup reviews!!! Been watching since forever literally and the people have missed your reviews!
It's good to see you redefining yourself. You are an amazing person never lose faith in yourself ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
posttttt this stuff againnnnn
Please don't ever stop doing reviews! I LOVEEEE watching you girl! 🔥🔥 NO ONE does it like you!
Hey Jeffree. I know you plan on quitting YouTube from Shane’s series since you believe youtube is dying but I think your genuine fans would appreciate your reviews on youtube. I feel like with tik tok, people consume content so fast and it’s just impossible to get an in-depth view of a product through the short snippets on tik tok. This is something that tik tok lacks despite the rising popularity in the platform. I hope you do more reviews like this once in a while on youtube and not quit youtube for good. We would really appreciate it ❤
Jeffree’s weight gain and lip filler dissolving changed so much! I wanna say tho, Jeffree always looks amazing but I do love this ♥️♥️♥️♥️
He looks so happy, healthy glowing. I’m so proud of him and everything he’s done for himself. He really started from the bottom now he’s here. Super proud of him I’ve been watching him since I was like 12-13 I’m 20 now and will always hold a special place in my head for him. He’s truly an inspiration
You all who fallow this wicked guy, all are putting your soul in danger! God said once you see the Abomination that causes Desolation, ( MEN DRESSING AS GIRLS AND WOMAN THAT DRESS AS MEM) BABYLON 2.0!!! Tata!!!
MY BABY!!!!!!!! We love you queen from Oklahoma. Come see me. Or I'll fly to you. It's my DREAM
I love the new jeffree.
you look gorgeous now without botox and ? you look so healthy, you look just fab! better than before!
Even if it would be the best foundation in the world, I wouldn't want to buy something from her! 👿🙅‍♀
No am wrong.Actually Jeff you look an amazing
He looks amazing and so healthy! Love it!
💗💗💗
I took the butcher knife mirror through TSA. They didn't mind at all. They kinda just kept saying how awesome it was.
Somehow, throughout Jeffree's whole video of trying foundation, I always love the finish from the beauty blender. It's more natural, more skinlike, and just more pleasant to look at than the whole no-pores finish on the brushes
Omg stop cause I just checked back in on you to see this . I’ve been waiting and didn’t even know it’s happening still 😍 letsss goooo reviews 😊
I love this new Jeffree 🎉
“Kinda plastic…but a little real” my new year resolution
His face looks great and plump!
You look so much healthier and happier now! I’m so glad you are finding peace ❤
i will forever love you jeffree never stop being you
I love you with brows!!
So glad you have eyebrows again. Every time I look at "Madge" (Madonna) nowadays without the eyebrows and it's a cringer. Eyebrows give us definition and make our eyes vibrant. They emphasize our cheek bones and gives our face shape and definition. Gurrl, love your tutorials. You always look fab and I'm glad to see you dumped the botox. I'm not a huge fan of doing things to ourselves like injecting a toxin in order to look beautiful. Poison to look beautiful. Just a tad bit 'wicked step-mother/Elizabeth Bathory, Joan Crawford - 'Sunset Boulevard' for me. A little too much like the movie "Death Becomes Her" and not my conception of beauty (though I'll admit to wearing a lot of Christian Dior's "Hypnotic Poison" parfum so I guess SOME poisons rock just not "The Tox".) Sorry for being judgmental but you have a gorgeous face, gorgeous definition. In the long run if you had kept using the "tox" you'd have lost that definition in a very unnatural way. I mean if one part of our face can't move then other parts have to compensate...for us older ladies it's like just moving the wrinkles around and prolonging our wrinkles in the long term. And the "Real Housewives" look is rather disgusting. And it comes off as very desperate. Lisa Rinna and that "lip" of hers...Kris Kard's losing her nose and if Khloe Kard has any more surgery, she'll have carved her face away. Going to such extremes is not maintenance but denial in my obviously not so humble opinion. Self-Love is not the same thing as Self-Distortion/Destruction. Aging is awesome and difficult at the same time. And that's what makes makeup so fun besides its ability to help us reinvent ourselves, BUT also helps us accept our age without having to chop, slice, stick, poke (okay, I like micro-needling), burn, peel, etc. And when we accept our age, we accept ourselves. And THAT is what is important. Thanks for the years of vids...I wish I could afford your makeup. Cause you're fantastic! I work in the concert industry and I'm of a "certain" age. Any tutorials for wearing makeup in that Wyoming Wind you talk about? Think working an outdoor concert for 18 hours a day in 100 degree weather and not being the youngest employee in the batch. Or being at Red Rocks Amphitheatre when it snows. HELP! No one does tutorials on that kind of makeup. But not all of us gals have "indoor" jobs. And my job is all physical labor. Makeup slides off and melts...Your help would be appreciated. Thanks again. Fabulous You!!
You look amazing!! Beautiful and healthy. Inside and out. It's great to find peace within.
I love seeing you happy, comfortable, and you have really found your element in Wyoming!😊
You should do a full face of Five below makeup !!!
Now I want it!!!
This Lady Gaga foundation looks amazing
Im not on other platforms…we want to see you here Jeffree. I dont have the attention span of a tomato! Give me reviews! 😭
Okay the final makeup look was giving Kris Jenner !  I had to double take for a second 😂
Jeffrey!! You look so much healthier, plump and just balanced! It’s giving new era and I love it and am here for it!
Can you drive the link for where you get your contacts? Or someone who knows lemme know
The foundation honestly looks so nice on you. It doesn’t seem to pick up on texture
I missed these reviews! Really hope there’s more to come!
I always loved Jefree but I absolutely loveeee him more now!
Queen Jeffree 💖
You are looking so healthy! You're just glowing and that is before you've even put any make up on. Here's wishing you the best 2023!
Jeffery is making moves in the makeup industry by being all natural now. Makes me feel more confident to be me 🥺💕💯
I just love how randomly Jeffree talks with staff like with any other friend🤗
Who’s here after Jeffree EXPOSED the Illuminati?!?! The names he chose for his palettes, are making so much more sense to me now! ✨
I don't know anything about makeup but wouldn't it make more sense to start a review without wearing any makeup?
i fucking love you. always have always will <33
Hey, I watched this video at least six-times at the day..  Also I've learn alot of makeup, skincare and all of #theshityoutalk I can be the only one, but I still graving my fckng RedBull, and pop corns. So don't even dare to quit YouTube. K bye xo that's all.
Jeffery, you should make a video reviewing homemade Etsy makeup!
You look Amazing! Love ur eyebrows! Beautiful! I’m a 58 year old grandma and watch ur make-up videos, wishing I could put makeup on like you, and be as brave! You are so funny while doing ur videos I binge watch ur videos all the time! And I just love ur little fur babies!! You look so healthy now keep up the great work, you look beautiful
I love that mirror
Love the brows and softer look very glowing and youthful!
Jeffree, I'm proud of you for speaking up. I know it's scary and most of us believe you. The world isn't what we think it us. It's good & evil fighting non stop. More of us are "waking" up. I've always questioned everything. I've never trusted the goverment, or anyone really. Stay safe please. Also please be careful. It makes since why you got the ranch. I knew you weren't the person they tried to make you out to be. I can see your aurora and your soul. Be careful. Please.
Jeffree you look so much happier! We missed you ❤️
Hi jeffree could you do a tutorial but using kids make up? That would be such a fun video.
I love your makeup! I got some for Christmas. And let me tell you- It’s amazing. 😍
Looks good
That looks like my color
PLEASE make some foundation and eye & face brushes. I've been asking you for3 years
Why is his skin red...
No puedo creerlo, que lindo y sencillo, no pude evitar escuchar la música de fondo cuando estaba en el restaurante, música regional mexicana
You look so good, different but good 😍
You look so much better with the fillers dissolved. Very pretty.
I love all of your makeup,skin,apparel and accessories. You're brilliant,outside the box thinking and mond blowing concepts are what I live for. Can you possible do mini liquid eye shadows like you do the mini  liquid lip for holiday bundles. Omg I need them all.
Where tf are we looking my dude
Hi, how are ya?
JEFFREE!!! You look beautiful without all the botox. So awesome that you are leaving all the toxic crap.
00:00:00  #jeffreestar
Jeffree you look amazing! Better than ever! You look so bright and beautiful! ❤️❤️
Wtf your hair !!
Jeffree has eyebrows now???
I used to watch you all the time like 4 years ago, I decided to see how you were doing and when i clicked on this video you looked so different ! then when you said you got your eyebrows back and your lip fillers removed i was like omg thats why. You look so much healthier !
You have eyebrows u look incredible I been telling u for years u needed then u look literally incredible @ Jeffrey
Love love love your videos Jeffree💖🥰
Someone said he looks gay😭
Jeffree you are looking the best you have ever looked!
That’s the mirror I need
Missed ya great review always keeping it real giving people credit where it’s due. Can’t get no realest than that. Love it.❤
Jeffree's skin! Glowing and lovely
This foundation is terrible, transfers like crazy. You need to do a wear test video because trust me this shouldn’t be jefree star approved
The music in the Background at the Restaurante. Banda ❤😂❤
I would love more technique videos on like different ways you do your makeup and tips and tricks
You're gorgeous💜
I love the Mexican music their playing in the kitchen 😂
I don't know man, the foundation looks amazing but you look orange? Is that just my monitor and lighting? Not feeling the shade but the finish looks velvety smooth and comfortable. I'm glad you're doing much better! You look happier <3
Makes me so happy seeing you at your best. I’ve been buying your products and watching for years. My now 6 year old loves the liquid lip and when she wants special time with me she will ask “mommy can you put jeffreee star lip stick on me please” I’ve even gave her some of my older star eyeshadow to her because she’s obsessed with makeup
Love you Jeffree! Been with you since Beauty Killer Days 🎤
That mirror!!! I love it❤❤❤❤
Your Eyes in this video are amazing!!! You look simply fantastic!!! xoxo
wow that foundation is soooooo nice
Stop saying 'bitch' all the time. It's offensive
You look healthier than EVER!
You have never looked better.
You do look better with eyebrows! Love the new look.
its been a while since i saw one of your videos, im happy to see you looking so healthy. you have help me so much with my english <3
Wyoming looks good on you!
I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS REALLL

You look freaking gorgeous! Alittle plastic but real! Love that! You are glowing jeffree Lynn ❤
Looking great!  I need to try this foundation!
You should see if Holograve Cosmetics eyeliners! Especially the water activated ones🥺🥺
Love the honest reviews. Especially for such makeup which is quite a price point for most. People (me included). Thank you for testing it. ☺
I’m so proud of you! You look so healthy and happy! Love you! ❤❤🎉🎉
You looking so good looks so much better with weight on and I really think my eyebrows look good and that Foundation is amazing
Jefree looks glowing. like a natural glow and It's so cool to see.
I love how you treat people so kindly and involve them
We miss you Jeffree
Can you do a rare beauty makeup review??
Bring these back please 🙏🏽 ❤
I didn't even notice the eyebrows until you said something lol
Who remember his 2016 videos ❤
Jeffree should do a zodiac collection
This was such a fun review ! 😊🥰 I may have to try that foundation.
In need of more reviews
Jeffree the concealer on the left eye is a bit much it seems uneven at first but slayyy you always look stunning 💯
2 months and I’m barely seeing this video! We miss you Jeffreee!! We forgive you & honestly don’t even care what’s happened. Just continue being you! That’s what we love! 100% agree foundation is amazing!
Most normal ohio resident
yb better
You genuinely look so much happier and it’s a joy seeing you back at what you love!
I so love your look now Jeffree! The brows, the weight gain your hair it's all amazing and epic....new home, new life, new you and I'm here for it all!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Wyoming looks good on you! You look fabulous ❤
Ohhhh God.... I looovvvee That mirror ⚰️⚰️⚰️🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Lol the waiters that guy telling jefree the girl was a jefree freak lol very cute moment.
Damn that is nice. I don't wear foundation but I wanna try that one. 😬👌🏼
Jeffre i love ur content u are so fun to watch u changed so much over the years and u had such a hugh characther development i feel so proud like u are family
more make up reviews pleasee!!!
Wow it glow
damn, Jeffree looks so different this time that the only Jeffree things remaining are the voice and the robe lmao. like the new haircut and everything
Ok. I’m late commenting. I love you soooo much. However, I work 2 full time jobs and would love to see a SheGlamm review. I don’t really get a lot of time to shop at stores for makeup and usually can only purchase makeup online but it tends to get pricey. Wanna know your opinion before I make a purchase. Once again, love you!
I like the brush side better. The beauty blender side looks more matte than the glass like finish on the other side.
Why is he copying Ariel Versace?
How about testing Gwen Stefani's make up line? You're looking amazing as always girlfriend.
Lady Gaga has so much foundation skin tone so much I love
Love you :)
i love the new jeffree <3
The packaging is rlly giving la mer
love his reviews, love lady gaga & now i need to buy all of this
So happy for you right now Jeffree! Missed these reviews the best on YouTube
You look  alot healthier  now
Jeffree is amazing in this video.
Ur natural lips are so nice ! Loving how healthy and beautiful you are looking 🖤🖤
You look good
Missed these
I love your reviews. Is the type of video series I like watching the most.
I’ve missed you!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
you can say what you want about him, but Jeffrey fought for a more inclusive makeup industry
The fact you’re a multimillionaire but still realize that $38 is a lot for powder is awesome
You seem so healthy and happy and I’m HERE FOR IT. So happy you’re back I missed your reviews. I have spent money on things you would have saved me from
You skin is gorgeous🌼
Doooo more reviews Jeffrey!!!!🥰🥰🥰🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
YOU ARE A GAY😡😡😡😡
OMG I LOVE NEW JEFFERY! I'm gonna be real, I loved old Jeffery too, but new wholesome, " I Love myself, Jeffery." I love so much!
I love that Jeffree reminds me of a lil mom that is just living her best life and we are her children:)
just straight guy who loves jeff review. i dont even know the technicalities of these cosmetics, i just love jeff..
I love Jeffery !!! He seems happy 🖤🖤
Now he just looks like an angry lesbian
Jeffree looks nice in all natural tanned glory!
missed u 😔
He looks good fr 🥰🥰😍😍😍 ok jeffree
OMG I HAVE MISSED WATCHING YOU!! and OMG you look so healthy!!! You do not look the same at all what have you done!!! YOU LOOK AMAZING!!!!
amazing!!
Anyone else feel like you’re watching this video on 1.25x playback speed? I guess I’m not used to him filming when he’s anything less than 10 blunts deep 🙃
I miss you doing collabs with other creators and doing crazy videos like you used to. These days you barely leave your house it seems and its either a launch video or a review. Maybe you're not getting as many viewers anymore because we can see your heart just isn't in it anymore.
*Kinda plastic, but a lil real😌"                - Jeffrey ⭐
I always watch Jeffrey's vids and I don't even know nothing or care about make up😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣.. Just love the process of transformation even though it's all the same 😁
I also love that he's practicing self care and dissolved his lip fillers and is eating better and just caring for himself. He looks fucking gorgeous! He's always beautiful but the shine he has from actually being happy and giving himself some love is amazing!
I just can't get over his eyebrows! He looks amazing with or without them! But I'm just so used to "is this Jefree Star approved" with no eyebrows! 😭😭
it looks like it oxidized, it looks orange.
If Jeffree says something’s approved…. It’s APPROVED
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
😘
Omg I forgot about the eye brows lol he has brows YAaaaaaY !! I love Jeffreilynn
To everyone reading just remember we were out here to grow and change as humans and we are in control over if it’s a positive thing or negative so remember positive things only happen if you have a positive mind god loves you and so do i
You look absolutely gorgeous and handsome and healthy all at same time I love this new you healthy you
Okay, I’m back.  It’s been like two years since I’ve watched a Jeffree review or video in general.  I’m happy to see him so happy and beautiful.  This is who I used to love.  Time to get caught up.  💜
He looks so good!!!!!
Love you with short haircut. Highlights Your face bone  structure
Jeffree oh my god!! I love you!! Love the growth 😍♥️
Jeffree... Please 🙏🥺 don't end YouTube, you are AMAZING 🙌🏻, you give us life with your makeup review's, your own make up pallette reveals and so much more. Your the best👑🤗
Sold buying this foundation and powder for Xmas for myself ❤️
OMG this video was the first time in my ENTIRE life I’ve seen the most beautiful transformation by JUST applying foundation. The difference is shocking !!! I’m about to throw my fenty in the fucking garbage. So dewy so healthy just glowing like a spiritual being. That foundation made an already flawless skinned Jeffree look STUNNING !!!! I didn’t realize how much I truly missed Jeffree’s reviews. I’ve been eyeballing this foundation. I’m just sad it wasn’t Jeffree to drop it. It seems so perfect. EDIT: OMG Jeffree those emerald green nails have me emotional 😍.. Sooo beautiful 😮.. You have the absolute best taste in nails ever !!! I would die with my nails blinged to Jeffree Star standard. It never gets old or tacky.
Lense brand and shade pleeeeeaseeee
I love a good foundation, but, I've honestly been loving skin tints !! Skin tints are where it's at for me 💜 A skin tint with alot of blush , bold eyes, and bold lips is where it's at for me 💜💜💜
Can you do a review on Kylie's wizard of oz collection???
i missed you   so glad ur back doing other brand reviews
I quit watching for a while but I’m loving the new jeffree 💖 the same but different, congrats jeffree on the new you ❤
Jeffree, you look amazing! Your skin is glowing! You look so healthy. You are a true testament to clean living and enjoying nature.
Moving out to Wyoming is the best thing that ever happened to Jeffree.
Asian brands all do that “sifter” for their setting powders ❤
Yaaas bitch! We love Jeffree Star makeup reviews!!
Oh how much I have missed the reviews
I really love these reviews! Hope more come in the future! Would love to see the Peanuts Wet N Wild Collection.
We need more videos like this you are amazing doing reviews, don’t leave us
Wonder what shade is on his lid? It’s so pretty goes really well with the crease shade ❤❤
Beautiful look Jeffrey ❤
You look so much healthier now!
What's with brows? Cruella devil style?
You look so amazing! The new Ranch life really suits you. Like DAMN!!!
I am gonna miss Jeffree on YouTube… especially his makeup reviews. I hope he decides to keep doing them every now and then!! I think more Wyoming content is what we need
it’s been years i haven’t visited this iconic channel!❤ love the eyebrows!❤
I literally learned how to do my makeup from youtubers lol God bless
We love you xxx
I really missed ur make up reviews
YOU ARE SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL JEF
JEFFREE! don't say people don't care about your videos, they DO! I DO!
So great to see you back doing reviews . You look amazing
I love the mental space he's in now. Nobody can deny how far he's come. He's learned allot along the way shes really grown.  He's NOT the old him. He's the new him. STOP belittling his progress!🙄  Yes I'm BLACK🖤 we STAND Ms. Jeffree #NoHate
You're quite handsome sir😘
❤️ 💙 💜 💖 💗

Hi
Why are you here? Why are you alive? https://youtu.be/F6YbLfB4GTQ
Jeffrey, what’s yours and Tatis relationship these days?
Jeffree your skin is BEEEEEE YOOOOU TIIIII FUUUULLLLL!
6:25 GET OUT OF MY HEAD
please stop
that hair isnt it :(
I really enjoyed this review, been in the mood for looking for a liquid foundation instead of powder only. Truly loved your energy and your going natural without lip fillers and Botox, makes feel like this review helps since I have more untouched and textured skin. I really loved reviews and your personality was genuinely calming to me. I hope you do more but I understand if you don’t want to. Just wanted to put out some good energy for you, much love Jeffrey.
LOVE IT LOVE YOUR REVIEWS  should keep up the make up reviews  pllleessse entertaining!!!😜😀😀
really miss these makeup reviews, i love/d your judgement on makeup
You look incredible. Always loved you but this Jeffree feels more real, comfortable and I trust him more. Also, the hair is amazing.
Great review. Just for this foundation today and love it. Looks very glowy and skin like for sure
I am so happy for you Jeffree, you look so content and healthy! Love that for you <3 xx
Love the honesty. Honestly I live for it. I can't stand fake people. I think we would have so much fun hanging out. you just have that good energy. I love ur videos the whole vibe. N I ain't gonna lie that foundation looked nice alone. Like if I was in a super rush lil bit of that foundation, some mascara, lip gloss, lil blush n out the door. It definitely has a fresh look to it. But u look good in anything u put on ur face tbh. Ur just that bitch 💋✌️💜
You've never looked better Jeffree!
Foundation is too orange
Love this new real Jeffrey
Came here for the makeup review, now I want to embrace my wrinkles and get the iPhone 14 pro.
Jeffree 💜🥹…you look so gorgeous!! Like someone who now knows their self-worth & has a lot of self love. Like someone who’s truly happy. I love it & you! I’m excited for your journey 🥰.
Ive missed you so much. I went from watching you everyday to just poof you left. Please dont quit YouTube.  You look great
Jeffrey, you look incredible! Had to do a double take. WTG! You look so healthy and handsomely beautiful. Whatever you’re doing, keep it up! 😘🫰
Jeffreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you better not quit YouTube you and Shane are the only youtuber I watch 😤 I will not let you goooooooo 🤧😭
I’ve missed these. I missed that JS started posting again. Now I have so much to catch up :D
He had a Paris Hilton glow up
Omg I was just thinking of tsa when I first saw this vid LOLLOL
Jeffree your looking so good and healthy since you moved too the Star Ranch.

Yesss! I love the Jaclyn Hill Bronzer! Thank you for giving her her flowers. She does get a lot of hate and I’m just glad finally to see someone using her products and giving them credit. Her bronzers & highlights are GORGEOUS.
I really hope you don’t quit youtube. It’s so upsetting for many of us who love the beauty community on youtube. Wish we could go back to 2016-2019. Your videos are such a comfort for me I’ll miss u :(
I missed thisssssssss
That fan girl at the restaurant turned bright red!😂 You made her whole year! Love it, so sweet!
Always the best videos to watch on YouTube! Don’t ever stop creating them! We love you Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️

I so missed your reviews!  I trust your opinion!
I miss you so much on here and I love you don’t leave us

When can I fim
When I marry her now
You look sooo happy and healthy! Love that for you!❤
This is not related to this video and im probably super late to the party, but I wanted to leave this comment anyways.  I just wanted to say your content/videos and demeanor are much better now that your not with Nate. Im sorry if this is a sore subject, but he legitimately brought you down to an unrelatable level. I feel like his immaturity rubbed off on you and thats not something I see portrayed in your content anymore.  I appreciate the work you put into the progression of the beauty community and what you have to offer.  I don't follow the drama. I dont really care about it, and although im not a subscriber I have seen you grow since the Myspace days and am happy you are where you are in life. Im an outsider and cant imagine the struggles of your daily life, nor am I ignorant to the fact that everyone is not a perfect person, but you are a product of your environment. And so far this new change looks good from my perspective.  Also, your liquid lipsticks are hands down the best ive ever come across. Its hard to shop anywhere else. :) ❤️❤️
I’ve been waiting for u to get “older” ,so I can figure out what foundation I can use because as we age makeup is so weird. Gonna try this and see if it gets in my wrinkles most foundation make me look even older so I stopped wearing them.
hey!I'm a personal trainer,Bike guide,snowboard and ski instructor,wildwater guide and many other things...I would love to work for Jeffree!!I NEED A JOB! Plz contact me
Me and Jeffrey's b day is coming up we're the same age. I saw him at warp tour when I was young and he was in the music business, I have always liked him.
Love you back and yes Gaga did good good! Beautiful on you for sure.💖💖💖💖
Foundation and powder look fabulous! I don’t think I would buy for myself though…products looked super small. It might last me a couple weeks, haha.

Nice
Someone had a lot of caffeine before filming this video 🤣
honestly at the end of the day, it's hilarious that as you get older you realize all the cliche's are legit real, but it takes a lifetime of experiences to truly understand them. Just something like the simple concept of "do what you love" is something that took me struggling for years against what I actually needed and wanted to realize that it's okay if the things I like or want to do won't satisfy other people's idea of me, because the only thing you can truly control is your actions and future
Jeffrey you look amazing. You get out of California and you are going out everyday got a tan eating better.
where is the old jeffree
Omg you look so good and healthy Jeffree! I’m sure you will never see this comment, but you look great!! Single Jeffree looks so good!!!!I love you makeup! And can’t wait to order more!!!!
Duranguenze playing in the background at the restaurant iconic.... mexicanos cocinando en Wyoming
your slight tan w the icy white hair is GIVING... you look so good you're literally glowing!
I haven't tuned into your channel is a long while... I don't know why but just saying, I missed you Jeffree. So so good to see you and you look stunning and healthy. Like healthy in your soul, you can see it in your eyes.  Nice to have you back💋
Like a fat fan but huge
You still act on camera like if you were on stickam what a natural star you are I'm a big fan
So so glad to see you back again for a review. Love love love your reviews ❤
Stopped watching you for 2 yrs...Came back and Bitch.....I missed your reviews! I'm about to check this foundation out💗
JEFREE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A LONG TIME AND YOU LOOK FABULOUS,  AND I LOVE YOUR EYEBROWS🤩
I’m obsessed with his naaaaaaails omg what a pretty colour
Please review the new Bath and Bodyworks Moxy skin care 😫😫
I stopped watching Jeffree about 2 years ago, don’t really know why but now that I’m back it just feels great, like I’m at home.
When you said shall we ask someone random. I heard shall we glass someone random lol
I always love your reviews. You're such a character 🖤❤️🖤❤️
I knewww something looked different and it wasn't the hair or the skin tone. Jeffree has mf'n eyebrows! Yesss workkk
You look ever so much healthier and happier. Wyoming life suits you.
You just seem healthier and happier..happy for you.
I miss jeffree doing these brand reviews i want to see a full face of shopmissa from jeffree so bad!
Mata

I don’t use foundation or any heavy makeup, just eyebrow pencil, mascara, and eyeliner. But I’m here because I love you Jeffreestar.
I never committed on Jeffery’s videos before but I have to say it he looks better.   I am kinda impressed.👍
You look so healthy ❤
We miss you Jeffree. I'm over the hill, old enough to be his grandma & absolutely adore his personality.  Bet he's working on something very special for Christmas can't wait to see folks open their mystery boxes.  Know he's been dealing with a little depression i hope he's ok & doesn't forget us Jeffree your personality is what drew us in to begin with please never forget that, you're loved by millions.
Jeffree, I like that you actually look at the people you are talking to when filming. Most just look into the camera 📸 the entire time.
For Jeffree 🧿🧿🪬🧿🪬🪬🧿🧿🪬🧿🪬🪬🧿🪬🧿🧿🪬🧿🧿🪬🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🪬🪬🧿🧿🧿🧿🪬🧿🪬🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿🪬
I love the mix of vlogging and review!
Oooo! I’m living for Jeffree’s more masculine look! He always looks amazing, but I’m living for the change up! Looking gorgeous and quite handsome as well! 💜
Amazing 🦋🦋💙💙💙
I think we all missed this jeffree! 💜

Omg jeffree ❤❤ such a pleasure watching you. I’ve been off yt for a while seems like I haven’t watched any makeup tutorials in a long long time. So glad to find myself back to your channel Pooh 😊
The haus labs glam attacks were straight fire for me, but these new products seem more her, high end, better quality, unique. Idk I will stand anything Gaga does til the day I die. I loved using the glam attacks for giant winged eye looks with my newer no brows
"That's some solid foundation." - The Watcher on the Wall

Dear

7:52… love it. Probably the best match for you yet ❤
“It looks scary at first…Like girl…Is that your f**kn color…” 😂😂😂Stop it. Just stop. Lol. I haven’t watched Jeffree in a minute and he’s got me dying😂”TSA loves these. It’s a great conversation starter.” 😂
You look amazing! Lovely to see you back here!!
He looks great!! He’s actually quite the cutie
OMGGG GURRRRRL YOU ARE SOOO PRETTTY <3! You arent like all these content creators out here these days who just be using that *IGR0Cket* to blow up on the GRAM... Seems like anyone can go big on the gram these days..
Ewww
Hey Jeff, are you a pedo? Your creepy interactions with Ian Watkins are... disturbing.
You look AMAZING. As always, I love you and it’s great to see you back.
Honestly Jeffree is the only beauty channel I watch 😛
Can we get more YouTube content??? I miss reviewssss

You looks so good Jeffree Baby!!! Like yahhhh your glowing under the Wyoming sun!🥰
I missed these videos!   I’m embarrassed to say I actually unfollowed awhile back. 😢 I couldn’t relate to the later videos but now I’m loving… ABSOLUTELY LOVING the direction your content is heading and the path you’re heading too!!!  Now I’m a sub again. Love you J ❤
You are a swindler, my products arrived wet with mushrooms, I presented my claim with evidence and documents and you say that it does not proceed, you are an abuser, you make rich at the expense of others...
Good
Good
Good
Honestly, no one can compare to Jeffree's reviews. He's authentic, honest and straight forward since day one!  On a side note, so happy to see Jeffree looking so healthy and youthful. Glad he's had a change of lifestyle since moving away from LA 😊
Can you pls do more videos trying full faces of brands please  I love watching you when I’m high af it’s so comforting 💖🫧
Wow, you look so well Jeffree! It's wonderful to see!
Jeffre can u please bring back the liquid frost!!!! Please please please

Missed Jeffree star!!
Żałosna postać :(
I love watching the new Jeffree so care free and so expressive without botox and all! Keep up with the self care you look amazingly happy
Omg please I would love if he reviewed Abby Roberts new collection cause I would wanna buy it but I wanna know if it’s worth it 😭 can people comment on this for he can review it
Jeffree you seem like you are in such a better place so sweet and healthy. I have always seen past the tough bitch facade and know you felt you had to be that way because of past trauma.
You look fantastic.
You look 10 years younger😮😮  you must be eating healthier and taking care of your self well done ❤
the glamour is literally gone
Looks better using the brush
That mirror 😍😍😍
I love it
I miss this type of videos just chilling, no intense editing and shouting..  just pure chit chat and honesty
I just want to say, your skin, brows, hair, EVERYTHING is looking amazing!!!
Maybe I could sell some shoes. I'm kind of in-between jobs now. I need to find something. I've done shoes before. It's a lot of work. I can't really be that picky. I need a paycheck
I miss you so much miss thang! Lol.. seriously though Jeffree please do more videos reviews tutorials! You just missed! I’m so glad your happy!
Hey jefree.... post a makeup tutorial
Where do I get one of those mirrors. I’m new here lol
MR STAR, love me 💥❤️💢 BYE ♡
I needed this. Thank you
Hey Beautiful, Just me again   I in the future plan on making and releasing my own Acrylic Paints and Talc combination in individual bottle so one can use the paints and if they would like too add Talc too thicken up the Paint formore coverage
Hey Beautiful   I have been experimenting with Liquid Foundation, Super Stay by Mabelline ♡ mixing liquid foundation with Baby powder too make a very thick Mousse and is soo delicious too look and and swatch next too a swatch of Liquid foundation for you too try out, add and mix baby powder with liquid foundation until the liquid foundation turns into a Mousse and doo check the ingridents on the Baby Powder too ensure you are not using the Cornstarch baby power and using the Talc based Baby powder, does effect the result, the baby powder sucks all of the oil out of the liquid found ation and omg smells soo fucking good I could eat it, Concrete full coverage faces here we come! also mix a second batch and let dry out for a couple of days and crush up in a Mortar and Pessle and turn into a Setting powder..   Oh and and and use a Raw Sienna (Yellow) mixed with white for Beige and Ivory colour foundations, I made with Acrylic Paint first and omfg
10:30 u can hear the mexican music lol i loveeeeeeee it but im glad you are back doing make up reviews <3 cant wait to see more jeffree <33
Can you make a video while shopping, am i the only one who's curious how jefree queen do shopping in some luxury brands
I just love so much how he interacted with the staff. This DEFINITELY feels like a new Jeffree. Sad to say most people aren’t accepting of the fact that people can change. I’m proud of Jeffree. As he should be of himself!
That foundation looks sooooo bloody good on you! 😍
Wow Jeffery has never looked better! This is his best look yet
Jeffrey star? Can you make some iPhone giveaway? i wish you will do it and i hope im one of the winners.
Wow Jeffrey you look so healthy and amazing I'm so happy for you !
Those green nails though 😯💚💚💚
🤢🤢🤢
You are so weird. Why are you a person
Hello I'm Jeffree star and my promoters said the only way for my channel to actually live on is to make another apology video and to dress up as an absolute slapper.
Love this new Jefree vibe
I H34RD YOU ARE THE 2RD RICHEST  CHANNEL!!!😳😳
Purchasing immediately
I’m living for you in the kitchen
J E F F R E E ⭐

I love this Jeffree. He seems so happy and healthy❤❤
It’s been a while I haven’t seen a review like this please make more like these🥺 I’ve been watching you literally since you started..
I wanna buy hauslabs foundation
love your reviews jeffree
Review KIKO makeup pleaseeee
Make an all in one tiny all In one 1930 mondaine compact with eye liner , mascara , eye shadow, blush etc . Handheld !! 😍😩
Please do a deep dive on Youtube. I did not get a tiktok because I do not want to hand over all of current & future info the the Chinese govt. I do NOT want them to have all my info across ALL my devices. I can’t believe how stoopid people are. You say you want to protect your privacy, yet give your whole life up for sale to the Chinese govt
You’re glowing baby
J: I literally dine in that restaurant every time I am in WY! You look amazing you look so healthy and happy. We are so happy that you are happy❤
Jeffree, you look hot!    You are absolutely exuding healthy and I love it!    Keep taking care of you.   I do love all your reviews!
I’ve missed Jeffree’s reviews so much! I’m looking for a new foundation, and have been waiting for a new JStar review. I adore everything he does. I’m watching while wearing my JS robe. I love it! It’s warm and oh so cozy. My only complaint is that it isn’t at all absorbent. If you like to put a robe on after you bathe and are still a bit damp; you might be uncomfortable. So, I just keep a robe to use after my shower. I know some are coming down 😊n Jeffries makeup, saying the formulas are different. I haven’t noticed any issues. The new eye shadows are bangin’ and the mascara is incredible too! I love everything I’ve bought from his line. I love the change in Jeffree, he seems so happy. ❤
Babe! Looking SOOOOO good!  So happy to see Jeffree is back and better than ever ! Love you to bits honey! Gorgeous!
I wish I could have Jeffery do my makeup!
15 million subs yet alot of videos don't reach 1 million views...and the ones that do are only just over 1 million...that's a dead YouTube channel tbh. Only getting about 1 million views when you have 15 million subs is hilarious
Jeff, I love this hairstyle on you!
Hi, I have been following u for ever. Tomorrow is my birthday and it would mean the world if you say hi. To me with this comment. Love you and your life journey!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I miss these so much. You’re like a hot mom that guides me in the right direction.
These fans are such a weird intersection of people who love self growth, real work, community, but also enjoy a good drag lol
Jeffree come back! You taught me how to properly do eye shadow with the pizza palette & I've been a fan every since. I miss your reviews!
I dont know what it is but, you're so endearing in this video and I have followed you for ... a lot of years. I really love you :)
I really loved the fact that there was no background music in this video <3
Kris Jenner vibes
I’m so happy to have you back giving me a review of things to try!!! Ty so much!!
We defo need more YouTube reviews rather than tiktok, so many of us don’t use tiktok!
ina mo bading
Thanks for being real Jeffree. It really means so much to see you embrace a wrinkle.  I can't even get into it, but this really impacted me 💛
I love you jeffree
💗
I went and brought this foundation today. It swatched really good in Sephora so hopefully this really does my skin wonders! 😊
You look sooo much better without that stuff in your face.
I'm SOOOO happy you are taking care of yourself, eating healthier, etc.  You are gorgeous without all the fillers and your tan is awesome!!!  It's obvious you are happy and healthy!! Congrats!!
Can you review Rare Beauty next time?
Might have to try this not a fan at the house labs Reddish gloss was sticky. I got it in my ipsy so it was almost the full price of the bag if I bought it myself I'll still use it i can't be that mad at it. I can't remember if you sell foundation or not.
I am loving this short hair era. 😍
I’m loving the eyebrows
How do you tell what foundation you should use if you don't know the shade of your skin? I really hope this question can be answered because I've been struggling to find my shade for years.
My eyes are hurting from the skin beauty filter on the video. Is it out of focus or do I need glasses?
Hey jeffree wyen are you doing a house tour
Jeffree looks SO much healthier. I'm so glad for him ❤️
https://youtube.com/channel/UCDpDGMwlsgmQiNgHQFoNIZA
Your eyebrows are great.  You remind me  of Linda evangelista from the 90s when she had short platinum blonde hair and dark brows. I love this look so much J.
Wat abt..."R.E.M Beauty by Ariana Grande"???
Love you so much
I just vomited in my mouth seeing this thing's mug.
“You stupid bitch..” 😂
Jeffree I know society is a cruel, sociopathic, hive mind set. I know the fame makes you put a cold front on. And its sad that you must. Youre a human and should be treated as such.  You have a curt cobain tattoo with a crown of thorns. I don't know your meaning behind it but that shows you know of christ. Please pray jesus sees behind the plastic and he loves you and calls for you.
Truthfully the new Jeffrey needs to bring back the old Jeffrey because New Draft really is a wore out
Lilah Gibney wants to be you so bad it’s not even funny
Best foundation ever
Omg I was thinking “yo he looks so different”, thought it was the hair until he said “the fact that I have eyebrows now” and I’m like “OOOOOHHHH” LOL
I think you look amazing natural Jeffree so glad you realize all your "imperfections" are what make you beautiful and amazing. That goes for everyone seeing this your amazing your beautiful just the way you are. Our uniqueness makes us beautiful and just who we are meant to be uniquely you.
im liking this new jeffree star plastic but real look, it look effortless & subtle in a good way. not like the old days which seem like a skull 😊
Hahhaha yeah right
71 NORTH
Visit DAYTON hahha
KEEP DOING YOU❤ and thx for the review we missed you and love you!!!
You should do a review on kiko milano makeup!
Or do a makeup look with the wedding pallete.  Cant wait getting that palette for my birthday next month (gonna use it for my wedding next year 😍)
Pleasssseeeee do a eyeshadow review next
The best thing is that you looks absolutely gorgeous and healthy. You stunning. You did the best thing for yourself and you left that place. Everyone can see on you. I'm so happy for you. You deserved it to be happy. 😊
I really love the New Jeffrey So Pretty and hot!
You are  g.l.o.w.i.n.g  😍 Ugh, now who's gonna buy a new foundation 🥵 it looks so good !
Dude,you make millions of dollars. You spend thousands alone on a single bag,and you're feeling weird about spending 48 dollars on a foundation? I'm dead 🤣
I am new to this channel...WHERE have you been my whole life Jeffree!?!? I never watch tutorials...I never heard of you before, until I came across a video regarding a Kanye rumor, and  seeing one video has me hooked. Your personality and your fashion, Jeffree, is to DIE for. If I had a Genie at my disposal, to grant me 3 wishes...shiiiitttt, my three wishes would be to hang out with Jeffree Star, For a week....you make FABULOUS look GORGEOUS with an addition of AMAZING!!!  mixed
WOW😃 I didn't realize how much I missed this crazy bitch until this new makeup review haha!! You look FANTASTIC Jeffrey and I'm So Happy to see you back  " GIVE"N IT TO US GURL"😂😍🥰
Hands down this is the most beautiful foundation you have ever tried
Supposedly he‘s living healthier and more natural, but why does he look scarier than ever?
I'm so happy for you. You look so much better Jeffree. Not that you didn't before, it's just that you're quite literally glowing now. Seriously proud of you 💜
First of all  I love you  and I truly loving how you looking. You are looking so natural and more beautiful. And I  respect your reviews cause you so damn real. Love you
At least you had great tattoo artists. That's the only thing you did right. I remember seeing celebrities get tattoos and they always would reference your name when they said where did they find the famous tattoo artist from.
Love you're vids ❤
The content I NEEDED and bitch you've never looked better 🤩
You are looking so beautiful. Stay this way, it seems less complicated - I'm happy for you.
Leaving the drama in LA is THE BEST THING Jeffree could've done for himself... so glad to see you thriving mama👏🏻 and bless you for always giving us completely unbiased reviews 🫶🏻
Your real friends know what's up. ^ .~
The more real you are Jeffree, the better! Keep going!!
ععمم مةج٠
Please Jeffree, for reviews, makeup tutorials, etc, keep doing the YouTube videos, shorts/reels don’t feel right.   Also, I know you’re a rancher lol, but we miss makeup tutorials, not necessarily for new products, just for fun, do tutorials with Lipstick Nic, for your pallets like Star Wedding, Pink Religion, Pricked.
You look healthy. I hope you heal
Glad to see jeffree back 🧿
dog: put me down weirdo 😳😖
U lookin like Kris Jenner 😂
You look fabulous. Great hair and tan. You look alive
Love it!
I dont ever wear full makeup but i love watching make up videos
I love how casually Jeffree is in back of house of the restaurant, in the servers alley. 😆 it's so wholesome! I can't wait to try Jeffree's yak meat 😋 I have loved him since his hot pink MySpace days.
Thank you for reviewing Haus Labs Kristen Wigg!
Yassss Gaga

I haven’t seen a Jeffree star video in about??? A year and a half? Almost two years?? And now that I’m back here today. All I can say is WOW. Jeffree, you look amazing and the vibes you’re exuding are so so so different. You just look so healthy and at peace and beautiful. Kudos!!
I can feel Jeffree's peace ✌️  Doing great things, keep going 🥰

Hello jefrrestar
Aww man I've missed this 🥺🥺🥺 . Genuinely make me happy seeing this review.
i got to have that mirror
Boo your teeth issue doesn’t bode well for your health & all that phosphoric acid in Red Bull eats away at your enamel.
Love all your reviews. Too bad I can't see the new ones. I don't do social media
Loveeeeeeee the new jeffreee
Nothing like this dude making millions off of vegans to fund his yak slaughterhouse. Slumlord Star.
Wtf does anyone notice the fact that she's the richest YouTuber on YouTube
TRY HER LONG LASTING LIPSTIC

I miss this so much..only reviews I'll watch..love it ❤
How isn't that considered as a mental illness?
You messed ur life up mate
Love it please more YouTube more more
You should do a video comparing a full face of makeup where each product is $1 vs each product being $100
A savage
I LOVE the eyebrows and your lips look great!  Your skin looked fabulous BEFORE you put on foundation.  So happy to see you are doing so well. I thought for sure the color of the foundation was too yellow, but it blended well and looked great.
Jeffrey Star has been cancelled.  His day in the sun is over.   He's lost millions of subscribers
OMG it has AMICA cream!
You look great !
You look so much healthier. 😊
I ❤ the new Jeffree..and u r glowing..😊
Jeffrey you look beautiful, fresh, like omgggg😍😍😍😍😍😍

Hello jeffree star I would like to experience a normal day with what you do and so that would be so cool 🙃 greetings PS from is just a question or idea

Love you with all my heart 🧡
We missed ur reviews here ❤
I just ordered  your magic star concealer and a velour lipstick can't wait to get my order in
I wanna know what that glow on the chicks is
🖤🖤🖤
I was just thinking "Mh..there's something different in Jeffrey.." *realization* *GASP* "HE HAS EYEBROWS!!"
Jeffree luv can we just only do makeup reviewing and doggie family blog from now 🥰 you're so beautiful particularly in these series of videos
where were did you go out to eat? I live in Casper and that looks familiar. Like I have been in that bathroom before. I'm so sad that we haven't run into each other because I was a big fan of your music back in the day and I love your makeup and I enjoy watching you and think you do so many wonderful things for others! Some day I hope we cross paths. <3
Zero interest in anything by Lady Gaga. Support local MUAs instead.
Hi beautiful! I  found my love for make up becouse of your videos! If one don’t fall in love w you , they are dead!!! But you have taught me so much, and I want to say thank you for introducing make up to me, I just got my first pallet for Christmas last year and I LOVE it! Also, you encouraged me to start doing videos and trying to become an influencer. Well on Tk Tok . So I hope you know just how inspirational you are, as you are also beautiful ❤ Tk you!! I can’t wait  to start adding all ur stuff. It will just take me a min😂😂 so again thank you! Much love
I dnt like it I returned it she was too greasy n my skin is dry
Is this a man or a woman or both 💀
Dying for the tan skin ❤️ I took a break from watching since highschool. I’m in my senior year of college and I’m sorry I forgot u were a real one and I’m glad to be back 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 slay me for the rest of my life 😮😮😮😮😮
Miss you!!   Love you
I love fire rock! There food is delicious. Just took a day trip today to casper from gillette. We tried out the wyoming ale restraunt too. Delicious. And the makeup looks good!! Lol
Okay but Jeffrey looks so healthy! 😍 I'm living for this transformation!
To see you doing so well is so amazing, looking stunning, babe. It’s nice to be back on your channel. ❤️
"We all know..." Darling, I know nothing but it's nice to see some new content! Tan looks lovely.
It looks good
When you held that iPhone 14 Pro Max, i thought u were using a DSLR camera 📷 the quality is insane and....  Ahahha, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORCERY IS IN HERE".
I’m sorry, but this side part is just not my favorite thing on Jeffree- regardless of gender fluid look.  It almost reminds me to those guys, who try to cover a bald spot. Which he definitely does not need.  Any hairstyle would be better!!! Please change!
Haus labs has bronzer too. Can you do a full face using Haus labs products? And her eye products?
You are fabulous bitch. Looking like you are living your best life girl.......xoxoxox9
You look amazing Jeffree 💯💯♥️⭐️
thank you Jeffree🥰miss you!  you look amazing🤍⭐
F.......FINALLY JEFFREE .!!!!¡!........YOU NEED TO BE YOURSELF TO BE THE BEST😊😊😊😊LOVE YOUR NEW YOU ...GOOD HEALTH ,NOT BOTOX OR FILLERS NEEDED JUST BE YOU 🥰🥰🥰🥰THAT'S ALL YOU NEED AND SUITS YOU THE BEST XXX WISH YOU ALL THE BEST ....SILVIA
You look great girl. Wyoming has been good for you.
Not Jeffeee in the kitchen!! Can you imagine your server telling you your food will be out after Jeffree is done asking the cooks about his foundation 🤣🤣🤣
I love you so much ur the OG
Love Jeffree Star reviews!
Jeffree looking like a blonde Kris Jenner. Love it
i love you jeffrey star hoping someday ❤️ you will my bestfriend ❤️ all the way from philippines
I taught you have undergone plastic surgery because you relly look good, so happy to hear that you live healty now.    Best glow up i have seen in a long time
Does Jeffrey going for a look of a GUY?????? What a transformation…🤔😮
Do R.E.M
The fact that miss thang is wearing adidas
People (like Lady Gaga and co) are going to tell you, "Hey, Lady Gaga fandom is part of your fandom. So, do a take reviewing her makeup to gain more followers and revenue for us both." But Jeffree, you stand alone. (**Scoffs**) Take YOUR goods and push THOSE! That's what your fans want and will make you more happy anyway! Maybe you don't believe people would buy your goods standing on their own? Well, that's just false. So, I guess it breaks down to-- do you want to serve more and sell less? Or serve less and sell more? I think the latter is more of a **LIVING** vibe, but if Lady Gaga is your friend it might be different?
Jeffree looks amazing ❤
I loved this video! Seeing you interact with random people was really cool, it humanized you in a weird way lol like it was really refreshing, most of the videos I seem to watch there are no other people ig I’m pretty stoned so idk if this makes sense 😅 it just goes to show that people can have so many seasons in life and I’m happy seeing your new season
I have been enjoying the smaller reviews on TikTok but this was definitely missed
Hiiiiiiiii QUEEN ILY so much you don’t even know
I wanna know YOUR makeup routine for everyday!! What products you personally use
Yesss keep making YouTube videos again!
Wow pretty nice, that new iPhone is amazing lol I thought the camera guy was in the bathroom 😂
i love how there’s a corrido playing in the background oh the video during the restaurant part hehe
How many of you can count the number of times he said  *_"bitch"_*   ??  🌚🤭
You look great 👍
Omg I miss this so f much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
مفهمشي انجليزي كداااا
مفهمشي عربي كداا
Quick question for ya jeffree, why dont you make music anymore? What happened to you and deuce?  I must know!!
You look fantastic ❤
I really love this "new" you! 💗 You actually seem healthy and relaxed inside an out. This was a very smart next step!  Now I hope that you will review more products and try on all of your own products here on YouTube!! It's so hard nowadays to find good reviews of your stuff (which still makes up about 95 % of the makeup I use), and I'm still only on Instagram and YouTube, so I miss a lot of the JSC news because no one that I already trust is talking about it. 😢
Looking good honey! 😘
never seen such a good person as jeffree. iconic
Jeffrey you look so good, your skin is glowing 😮 you look younger. Wyoming is doing wonders for you. I hope you have found true peace and happiness ❤
Omg, we have the same eye colour ❣️🇨🇦
Do a review on the Kris Jenner collection please!!!??!!
Love love Tik tok but we need YouTube FULL review baby 🥹🥹😘
I love your YT videos 💗
You are so healthy and beautiful! This life in nature with organic vegetables and meat without the hormones and cruelty life of animals in the big industries of meat (animals doesn't meat grass and are locked to never walk to have a soft and greasy meat), are making you be in the best version of you! 💗
You look way better and healthier. You look happy again and it’s showing xx
You look amazing so happy for you seems healthy 🥰❤️
jeffree looks really really pretty with eyebrows and a tan
Not sure if you read comments or not. Wondering if you’d ever do a Jeffree Star approve for Culler Beauty Foundation. Cause I’m just very curious of your thoughts, and how a brand can only have two shades available. That’s all! 😁
This is the first time in a long time that his reviews felt genuine and not sponsored or careful of being demonetized. Jeffree seems to be in a much better spot mentally and is thriving, happy to see him back
I love this foundation! It’s so good and yes, works beautifully with the Jeffrey Star concealer (my favorite)!
She is GAGA. Lol
I’ve been eyeing this foundation and damn — it really does look fucking good.   * add to cart *
I hope you have a new launch this year that is Halloween 🎃 👻 inspired.  Can't wait to see what you come up with.    Personally I like skulls/bones 💀 and movie 🎥🍿 like "Beetlejuice".  Although, "Indiana Jones" has some great videos to grab ideas from too.  The Holy Grail 🍷 makes a great makeup 💄 metaphor/name.
i LOVE liquid eyeshadow! AND Jeffrey's brows lips tan everything!!! i need the haus foundation!
the inside of the haus powder is soo similar to Unit's translucent powder but Haus looks waayyy better 😍
I want to see jefrree reacting to 🖤BLΛƆKPIИK💗and whats he think about the group cause he's also a music artist
that mirror tho!! 😍and those nails bitch!! 😍
Healthy Jeffree, we love to see it 🙈
Hi Jeffree! Just a big fan of you and your make-up products saying hello all the way from the Netherlands.🧡 I have really missed your make-up reviews here on YouTube! YouTube is so much more relaxt/better to watch your video's.❣So thank you for that.💓  Also i want to thank you for letting me learn so much about make-up and how to apply it all. You make so much beautiful and gorgeous products.  💌

I miss his SAVAGE reviews ☠️
Unfortunately, but your reviews does not look right anymore. It’s a bit fake.
I feel like wear tests are a must
I love the reaction we had about this being on tiktok 😂

Where tf do I buy that mirror 😂 I need it
Love the eyebrows ❤
Hi, my name is Amber. I ordered your rainbow pallette bundle online about 2 weeks ago, and wow. Let me explain what I mean. These pallettes are gorgeous. I've never been one to really do something like this. If anything, it was my oldest daughter's idea. She just turned 10 years old three days ago, and when I told her I got her six of your pallettes, she was over the moon and back with joy. I might have a tough time finding her foundation color and my own for that matter lol but that's okay. I just wanted to let you know that your work is phenomenal! Glorious in every way. It's funny though. I keep having this dream about you creating a winter themed pallette with a snowflake as the crowned centerpiece of it all. The name of the pallette is unknown to me, but the idea just sounds really pretty. Cool blue colors, whites of many different shades, a couple greens and browns to compliment the smell of pine and evergreen trees. You are an incredible person Jeffree. I don't follow up on celebrity drama because that crap annoys me. It's none of my business what you've said and done in the past. We're only human. We all make mistakes. You have shown the world how much of a STAR you really are, and I am forever grateful to be holding the most gorgeous pallettes I've ever seen. Keep rockin your creativity Jeffree. I look forward to your newest creations in the future.  Sincerely,  Amber ♐️🏹
Jeffree you look stunning in your videos but this one in particular, you are positively glowing.   The changes you've made in your life are showing on your face.   The Lady Gaga foundation looks amazing on you, it gave you a real dewy glow.  Cannot wait to try it.
Jeffree, have you tried gardening? I think the start to finish process would really be enjoyable to you, being able to see the literal fruits (and vegetables) of your labor seems like something you would love!
thank god. no more of those youtube shorts bullshit plz
We love the new Jeffree! Love this for you!🎉❤
How much money you make
You lookkkkk amazing!!!!!!
I MISSED YOU
I love this!! Lol you should do makeup reviews while your on ya ranch working! 💪🏼some girls need that good makeup that would last while we working and sweating lol
ahhh.... like the good ole days. HERE FOR IT <3
Jeffree I fucking LIVE for your reviews!! They are therapeutic!!!! ❤please keep doing them!
Please make youtube videos again 🙁🙁🙁
Tell me Jeffree Star doesn't remind you of Da Vinci. Everything he does is artwork. His existence is art.
Is this Kris Jenner's tattooed twin 😳 🤔 👀 😂
👍
For 1 you look soooo beautiful with this hair, tan, and eyebrows. 2nd... Plz do these more often. It's so nice to have an old school style review from you.
Has anyone else tried this foundation? I had a hard time finding a shade that would match me still don't know which one to get
Nice to see u Jeffrey!!!
He seems so much happier and healthy now and it just warms my heart ❤️ I feel like I've grown and healed along with him and I'm just overjoyed to see him blossoming 🌸
Jeffree, you are the only reviewer that I trust, just ordered the foundation from Haus Labs.
Love your videos ❤️❤️❤️ You look amazing Jeffree 😍💗🔥
Te amo

JEFFREY OMG. JEFFREY!!!! When is the Peach palette and collection coming.? Notice I didnt ask if ;)  HEAR ME OUT.  The scent of peach is sexy AF! And so many people LOVE the shade and scent of peaches.  So like a peach lip mask? some skin care in peach scent? A palette OR singles to the peachy shades you already have (i have a list of 9 :P)   I'm so tired of trying to find a peach palette and only seeing that DISCUSTING too faced palette. WE NEED to put that monstrosity in the far far past and who else to do it then MS JEFFRY LYNN HIMSELF. that ICONIC formula of your is UNBEATBLAE. pleasssssssseeeee WE NEED THOSE PEACHES AND CREAM ;)
this video was awesome! i loved when u came up to the restaurant staff to ask for their opinion!
Please keep your hair short Mr Star, you look so handsome with it short, besides, you can always get your wigetry on lol. Love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 U.K. 💖
Hey Jeffree! Could you pls review Rhode Skin?
I love you and so proud of you❤
I am writing to you because I want to share what happened to my son in hopes that you can also help me share. My son was a victim of a carjacking on 9/21/22. We live in west palm beach Florida and he just so happened to be visiting the beach as he suffers from depression. He stated that he stopped to send a text and next thing he knew he was being dragged and beaten out of the car. I can’t even imagine the horror my son was feeling in that moment but as his mother my heart breaks to know I couldn’t be there to protect him. When he tried to hold on to the car in order to keep the thieves from taking it they sped up dragging his body in the process. My son stated that the next thing he knew he was lying on the side of road left for dead. He tried to flag people down to help him, and no one stopped(which my heart continues to break knowing I couldn’t be there to protect and save him). Finally a trucker stopped and called 911. Once my son reached the hospital they called my husband to tell him that our son had been taken to the hospital as a victim of a carjacking but couldn’t give us any further information until we arrived. As a mother, words and emotions could not describe what was going through my soul, but as God is my witness I cried out to God to take control of the situation and give me strength. When his dad arrived the police were there taking a report and my husband was taken back by how unprofessional they were handling the situation. They stated to my husband that they found our sons car with someone inside but did not arrest them because they did not have enough “probable cause” to do so. My husband and I are still trying to wrap our heads on why the police made that type of decision knowing that the car had already been reported stolen, and obviously the person inside of the car was not the actual owner. In the process of the doctors working on our son my husband came to get me because he didn’t want me driving and having an accident myself due to how distraught I was from the news that we had just received. On my husbands way home the hospital called and told my husband that our son was ready to be picked up from the hospital. We where completely taken back and shocked as we could not understand how a hospital could release  him considering that his injuries were significantly serious. When my husband arrived back at the hospital he found our son sitting outside in a wheelchair. Our son was crying in agony and pain and we made the immediate decision to take him to another hospital and advocate for him. The doctors who took care of son at the ER were full of empathy and compassion. They immediately took care of him and started working on his injuries and pain management. As God is my witness this has been the most challenging traumatic experience I’ve had to go through as a mother and everyday I have to ask God to give me continued strength, as I need to be strong for Alex. I’ve had to take time off work because I refuse to leave my son alone. We received news yesterday that our son has a small brain injury and there may be a possibility of facial paralysis on his right side. We are praying and continue to share his fundraiser in hopes that anyone reading this can help me spread the word. Please if you find it in your heart, help share this fundraiser so that it can reach as many people as possible as our son has a long road to recovery ahead of him. God bless♥️  Please help me stop violence and raise awareness by making my sons story go viral. ♥️  https://gofund.me/35646c62  Sent from my iPhone

I actually love the color and the mirror 🪞 💋
Thanks for trying for me
Jeffrey Star need it’s own foundation too !!! We need it !
The background isn’t it……. Green screen, I don’t like…
Just came back to check in on what Jeffree's been posting and... *He has eyebrows now?* Where did those come from??
Presta s'il te plaît le maquillage pourquoi tu le transformes en abattoir et pourquoi tu c'est toi qui fait la polémique autour de toi c'est toi qui te fait attaquer

I'm living for your nails in this video. I'm sure people have asked this dozens of times; what kind of tips do you have for color matching foundation/concealer?
You look SO good and SO healthy. For real I have such a crush on Jeffree and my husband is not aware. Can't help it 🤷‍♀️
i mean im glad jeffrees back but its not the same now😪
It never stops astounding me how spectacular Jefree's face is!
Wow you look amazing… that foundation is awesome
Your skin looks amazing!!!

Scared the s*** out of me when you picked up that mirror😂
Yes please keep posting reviews on YouTube!!! This old girl is not on or into TikTok. Not my scene. I live for JS reviews 🥺❤️
It's not that it blends, it's that you covered that whole part of your face with that, so..it matches what is there.
👌🏻👌🏻💫💫💝
Love you and miss your reviews!!
AR-Ni-Ca my love
That is one of my fav places to eat lol
That moment i refused to watch the review u till it came to YouTube cuz that where all the tea is !!

Do a shot every time Jeffree says "bitch". 🤣😂
Zarb it with your story, come back, you straighten your soul, brown 🔪⛓️🔪🔪🔪⛓️⛓️⛓️🔥🔥
ضضض
A little bit to shinny. I wonder what it looks like with highlighters!
Wow well I know which foundation I'm getting next mine always is so patchy by half way through the day
Put this on for me daughter to watch but I'm honestly shocked about how amazing he looks since leaving LA. He looks so healthy. Hopefully he's extending that mentality to all parts of his life.
Jeffree, you look beautiful!
Don’t use tik tok .. not interested.. so yes review 👍Btw brilliant product and luv that u dissolved the li filler.. looking fab !
Goes on like butter
LOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEE THIS REVIEW!!!!
Love You!💐 You’re so hot, I’d like to see you bulk up with some muscle I think you’d wear it well😍💪🏻
Jeffree, you look so happy and healthy, mentally and physically <3  totally here for it <3 :)
The foundation looks great, I am not a fan of the packaging its a bit basic to me. Did that guy say “she has all your products” lol blew up her whole spot haha, I love that Jeffree interacts with his fans.
Thank you for posting on YouTube!! So many of us love your detailed reviews or just your long stories! Keep posting please!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Your sick person !!!
When are we gonna get JSC foundation cos honestly I can’t wait
Jeffree needs to tell us where he gets his contacts because girl, they are so realistic!!
The way he said arnica 😅

Wow, Jeffree! You look gorgeous!!!!

You look great Jeffree!
Omg it’s Barbie👛💕👚🌸🍬
This is what we've been waiting for!!!
Looking gooooooood 🔥
I missed this type of reviews❤🥺, thank you so much, it’s so good to see you happy
This melted right off my face in this Louisiana heat and humidity 🥵 I wanted to love it but it’s 👎🏻
Jeffree Star looks like Cris Jenner. Glad to see Jeffree being happy and awesome...
so refreshing...
Missed these videos
Your very pretty with makeup on
Oh bjtchhh we LOVE him again
Nice review, Jeffree looks great
I love the music in the background 😍 viva Latino America! Your face looks beautiful as ALwaYs but yes I'll pay 45 to try it.
You’re looking incredible Jeffree! 😍
I must say that Jeffree’s skin, hair, and body look so much healthier! Talk about a glow up. He also looks much happier ever since moving to Wyoming. 😊 So much growth and a detox! 🌱 He’s a ray of sunshine!
Your energy has shifted and it's good. I hope you're not pretending. You seem to have CHANGED for the Best and radiate POSITIVITY, we are water signs so take care of your feelings baby.
ahla oen ???????
Lov u Jeffree
Besides being on for 8 hours, it looks like that foundation was patted on with your hands alot too and still looked that good. P.s. I like this version of you very much.
At this point nobody cares if you approve anything or not
Why are you so White?
Best review vid so far !
Beach you in heaven or something that backdrop is Blindddiiiinggggg
My Darling u look so amazing, 2 me u r at ur best, everything about u is magnificent, thank u 4 all u do being u, sending u a bazillion huggies besos
Jeffree love the brows! AND, nobody makes a true light blind brow product! I’ve searched high and low and nada! PLEASE MAKE ONE!! We need two lighter shades for blonde… one warm one neutral. I think making a bit more would be amazing! Have one very very light , but still visible and it can be mixed with other shades to get your own perfect shade!!!
I'm waiting for jeffree star's new house tour ✌✌🙂🙂
You look amazing Miss Lynn! Wow! So happy for you 💕☺️💕 You truly are healthier, and it’s showing! You deserve to enjoy your Yak’s and the beauty all around yin peace. So so happy for you! And I loved the firearms practice videos. Pink of course and I looooved it!
Hi Jeffrey me and my mom love you and we watch you everyday while I do my makeup for school and we want you to review the brand 17. I'm not sure if its in the us since im in the uk It's the one I use but I want to know if  you would like it too. I hope you will see this we love you and when we have money we want to buy your mascara, blood sugar,  and foundation:)
Thank you!!!!
U talk too much
As much as i want to, i don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive/forget everything he’s done
Make up looked great up until he put on concealer
You look great without makeup.

."...do you want to slap me across my face?"😂😂😂
The fucking clever in the opening!!!!!!
I’m confused at “skin care benefits” but never mentioned what they were?. And then said your concealer has skin care benefits too, I never knew that and I have a few…?
You’re gorgeous, love your silver hair!

Yelling doesn’t equal “high energy”.  Jeez!
ভাই    ,   তোদের      যে     কোনো     কাজ    নেই     l   তোদের    দেখেই     বুঝতে     পারছি      l    তোরা     এসব     ছাই    ছাতা     না     বানিয়ে     ভিক্ষা     করে     খাস     l    নাইতো     চুরি    ডাকাতি     করে     খাস     l
Jeffree seems so free! No botox, no more lips, has eyebrows! But mostly importantly, seems so much more comfortable in his skin 💕 even the way he speaks has changed, doesn't seem like a "show" anymore
Omg, I didn’t even notice the lip filler was gone!…Jeffree looks so beautiful, he’s exuding so much happiness and positivity ❤
To buy list. I'm using fenty for years now and lately its been frustrating. Its cakey not like last time. Thanks Jeffrey the only makeup review source i can trust
Jeffree Star in Wyoming… R U Kidding Me? I love it!  ✌️ Jeffree has never looked better. Wyoming is good for him.
The Mexican music 10:12
THE MEXICAN MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND IS EVERYTHING :)
I did not realize how much I missed Jeffree doing makeup reviews. I’m loving how expressive he is while doing the review. I got super use to calm and mellow Jeffree but seeing him this expressive and knowing he’s in a better place in his life makes me happy for him. It’s really nice to see him passionate and makeup always seems to be that jam for him.
You look so happy and healthy. Love you. ❤️
Wow! Loving the more natural look with brows & a tan. Gaining a little bit of weight looks amazing on you. I've never seen you look so damn healthy! 💕
i am so sick and tired of you using kids cheers sound effect in all your videos i bet you prais it like its better then anything else and i cant stand it anymore
You look so good!!!
You look terrible without makeup     That very thing is probably ruining your face.
I have a lot going on in my life! and I’m still here for the reviews!!! My safe place.
Glad to have these videos back. Love your hair! Gorg 💋
I used to watch JS reviews every night before bed, this feels like the good old days ❤
i must get it !!
My four year old granddaughter said, nana that’s Jeffree Star 💫 😂😂😂
Jeffree you look stunning as always! Yes please more make up reviews for YouTube! I live for it! 💕
Happy to see you in a good place 😃
Jeffree is glowing!! I love the weight gain, the brows, and natural hair and lips. You are looking healthy and so good! I'm glad you posted on YouTube since I don't use tiktok or much of other platforms.
Once a prick always a prick. Now just with new hair.
Missed these videos.
He really looks better than ever!
I learned English because of you jefree, this makes me remember the good times. be safe ❤️
We need a JeffreeXJaclyn collab  - THE OG's!!
Jeffrey, you look so healthy and beautiful. The sun, the eyebrows, the normal sized lips, and your new healthier diet looks good on you.
I am living for this new fabulous and free Jeffrey star 🌟 makeup on point, stunning bitchhh 😮
I wonder if Jeffree will start reviewing or using Too Faced products on his channel now that Jerrod Blandino and Jeremy Johnson have left the brand.🤔
Now THIS! This! This is the Jeffree Star we all love so much! This is what made me fall in love with Jeffree from the very beginning so many years ago. I’ve missed these reviews so much! Jeffree, it’s so refreshing seeing you in this light. Happiness looks so, so good on you. And it’s not just a surface level happiness, you can literally just tell your soul has healed so much and it shows! I’m so excited for your future and the future of JSC and most importantly the future of the new and improved ⭐️JEFFREE STAR 2.0⭐️ Keep the videos coming! Jeffree Star is BACK y’all! ♥️♥️♥️

There is nothing more relatable the you talking about the bronzer streak, and screaming. Haha. I feel that in my soul. I'm as pale as a ghost and that's so relatable.
Kinda of plastic but always real!   Love ya!
I have missed these reviews!! So glad you are doing some!
Holy shit you look AMAZING!!!! I could tell immediately that you dissolved your lip filler. Omg I can't get over what a difference the changes you've made truly make! You've always been gorgeous but you're a whole other level now!!!!!

What happened to your pink Lamborghini Urus!?!?!
I'm loving the 'new' Jeffree Star!!
Jeffree youre looking good
I feel like you’re one of the very few on here that will give a honest review!  Even with Lada Gaga’s  comment you don’t let that jade you and make you only say good things about her products.  You’re real with your honest thoughts and I freakin love it.  You Loved the foundation, thought the white box package was blah, and the powder was so so.  I agree too on every point.  Love the brows btw 😍
The only honest reviews on YT!!! Thanks Jeffree!!!
you're gorgeous!! like your face today like you gain.. so nice
I love makeup
Loving the peachy vibes! Makes your eyes pop and your skin looks flawless!! ❤
I am so glad to see you thriving so beautifully. It's about time Jeffree. You look like an Iconic Goddess as always. Keep doing you girl and continue to find that beautiful smile of yours. Love you always

OMG! You look AMAZING natural! That tan has you looking soon young! I love seeing you so happy!
Ternura68?
You look healthy
You look amazing and I love your nails
Yes looks great, jenni rivera playing in backround yes 💣
You're looking happier, healthier and better than ever.
And that’s how you know Jeffree is a successful reviewer !! No one watches youtube anymore for beauty content . Tiktok is the new beauty content platform and stillll we would watch a whole 20 minutes youtube review Just because JEFFREE STAR IS REVIEWING IT ! That small tiktok video wasn’t enough for us ! We needed more !!! We need the Original youtube reviews by Jeffree
Yayayayay! Thank you for the review sweetie! So good to see you looking good and feeling healthy and happy, for the non-tic-tok audience, please don't forget about us here! I like when you are out and talk to everyday people. The girls at the restaurant were so cute! Love love love you xoxo
Okay, but like as many videos as I watched of yours but this one was so rushed I wish you would have slowed down a bit to give a update on you before the product. We missed you!!!
I feel like the foundation is a lil to red but its cute ❤❤
A few questions for the Christians……A lady asked me to read the Bible awhile back and I am shocked about the things I read. From what I read your God is the leader of the Christian community, right? What I learn from the Bible is that he is a serial killer. Killing people is the solution to his problems. For example, he drowned the people with the flood, he killed the first born male of Egypt, he drowned pharaoh and his army, he killed the people of Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and the list goes on. My question is where was SATAN when he was killing the people? (Something to think about).  It is also written in the Bible that he created the wicked for his purpose….. What does wicked people do?….. They kill people, right?….. He created the wicked to kill people so that his earth won’t be over populated.  It is also written in the Bible that he created EVIL (Isaiah 45:7)….that means if he created EVIL….. that means EVIL is in him. He created lies, right?…..That means lying is in him, he is a liar. He created murder, right?…..That means murder is in him…..That means he is a murderer…..that is why it is so easy for him to kill people.      His heart is unclean towards people……He should have unconditional love for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah instead of murdering them for their sexual preferences…..Now my question to that is: Which sin is better?….Him murdering them or them performing sexual acts?      There is also a prayer that says: Our FATHER who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. How in the Fuk your FATHER kill you? If he is your FATHER that means you are his children…….Explain to me why would a FATHER drown his children? The same prayer says: And lead us not into temptation……that word temptation means doing wrong……why would you pray to your FATHER not to lead you into doing wrong?  Isaiah 45:7 says God created EVIL…..So if he created EVIL then who is SATAN?…..isn’t he SATAN (something to think about) His leadership qualities are fuked up. If he kills the people, then who his SATAN? Is leadership qualities are fucked up for real.
In the beginning his mirror looked like a butcher knife
You look amazing! So happy to see you healthy and living your best life. Stay true to you. ❤
So glad you're doing reviews again! Ive missed these!! And Jeffree you look AMAZING. Happiness looks awesome on you! 😍
you're giving Toby McGuire from spider man 3, vibes
Ok yup, I was wondering what it was…. You look GOOD! Healthy! Glowing! 🎉
Love the natural you Jeffree don't change Queen xx
❤❤❤❤❤
Yeeeeiii we love to see it! New healthy habits and happy Jeffrey💖 and still MU royalty of course
You’re slowly becoming a guy…lol.
You should review AVON makeup products!!
Why your hair look like toe nail
Jeffree looks amazing with or without makeup! I love the eyebrows. Wyoming must really be the right place for him.
https://youtu.be/bdOKx9XJBsU
I know Tik tok and short form content is all the rage but it can’t compete to a full in depth video, short content can’t be that great if they keep making it longer, isn’t it 10 minutes tik toks go to now, there’s so many lies and misinformation on tik tok and not just about make up so I usually wait for a jeffree review cause then I’ll learn the true tea on if a product is worth the hype and money ❤️❤️on a side not how amazing is jeffree looking
Jeffree looks like Kris Jenner on the vlog from restaurant 😅
his reviews are so honest and thorough i love them
Dụ con nít à
ONLY ON YOUTUBE!!! Don’t turn to tik Tom PALEASSSEEE
Natural Jeffree makes me feel more comfortable and he looks stunning. It can be hard to look at surgery face. It is okay to not be perfect because God knew what he was doing when he created your face. Beauty is so much more than fat lips and injections. That is what our world needs now.....to be happy and comfortable in our own skin.
You look like kris jenner
Aww Damm I thought you were announcing JS Magic ⭐️ foundation … I got all giddy then- ya big tease! 🤣
You looks really good right now! So much healthier and prettier 😊
I don’t do full coverage so I wasn’t sure if this was for me, but when the girl said it looks hydrated…hmmm.I was there!
Jeffree had proven that anyone can grow up and learn.
I never write comments on any Youtube videos, but I just checked and I noticed I've been following you for 10 YEARS. I've learned a lot from you, English, values, self love, makeup, and not giving a fuck about what others think about you. You are a true icon for me, and I admire you so much for who you are and who you've become. Please continue being the person we all love. THANK YOU SO MUCH <3.
Loved this video. I missed you Ms. Jeffree Lynn!
I missed this type of reviews from you….your skin looks amazing these days….so fun….
Love the new you! Looking great!
do rem beauty plz
I am loving your glow up. You’re so natural and beautiful and it’s awesome to watch you grow as a person.
THANKS !!!
Beautiful Jeffree!  ❤ ty for the honest review
"Now today...Bitch it's been a minute" 😂😂
I never comment, but you said it yourself that you healthy. So I am going to cc7omment for the 1st time. You look so much better.  In a healthy way.  I am so happy, proud I am not sure what to say.   MIZZ THINHG, keep it up your STUNNING!
No. That’s not your shade. Still too light.
Gaga the discriminating bigot can stick her crappy foundation where the sun doesn’t shine
love this new jeffree so much!! gives me absolute joy seeing him this happy 💛💛💛
He's so tan now 😍
I love the new jeffree, don’t be afraid to be yourself baby! You’re beautiful without all the fillers and add ons. ❤️
I wish I could shade match like you do.
Trusted and Approved by the One and Only!
🎉yessss we need more of JS product reviews
I LOVE you with eyebrows! You look sooooo young! (Not that youre old) love watching you and that foundation on your skin! Chefs kiss❤️😘
Jeffree with eyebrows!  I never thought I'd see the day.  Gorgeous as usual!
I LOVED the bathroom review without the studio lights. You could actually see what the foundation looked like on real human skin with normal pores and texture. That’s a REAL review and made me like the foundation even more.
Honestly this channel  the reason I started watching YouTube in the first place after MySpace
Yesss, I love that Jefree has found the freedom to embrace the natural beauty💗 the foundation looks great!
Open challenge to Amberlynn Reid: https://youtu.be/azKVbr2N70Q

Finally another video. Missed you
Go home don‘t talk
Your eyes are so beautiful
I love a JS review! Thank you darling!!! That peachy look was EVERYTHING !!! As far as uni-carton styling goes, I wish that companies would not put so much into box design, because then it makes it hard for me to throw out, and I end up with a bunch of boxes in my closet that are too precious to dispose of lol
12:36 you look SO good, literally healthy and glowing
god i LOVEDDDD this, it was so high energy and informative and the foundation actually looks so good on your skin! and i loved the restaurant reviews! pleaseeee keep reviewing products!!! i miss your old upload schedule so much

You have healthier look Mr Star, better food, more time being outdoors, less facial procedures = A happier version of yourself, your fans approve!!
I hope he doesn't stop reviewing on here - I find socials depressing lol & I come to YouTube for escapism
God you don't realize how much you miss something until it's back, have always loved these videos
Seeing your growth over these past two years has been astounding you are a completely new and different person in the best way and I am so proud of you lovely! I am freaking living for your tan btw the glow is so stunning 💜✨️

i miss this Jeffree Star Approved MissMaam good to see you back sending love from Philippines
Make Up Fake Up 🤡 full of chemicals  When are you ladies going to realise men don’t like make up monsters we like all natural
I really like the new jeffery look.
Jeffree doing a makeup review on YouTube feels like visiting with a friend you’ve not seen in a long time. I love his make up reviews because he’s honest and straightforward about the products no matter who created it.
So good to have the reviews back❤ Hope we have them often.
Wurk 💯😍
Jeffree, you look amazing 😍 and this foundation looks great on you:) I need to try it as well🥰
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Who has tiktok?!?! Not me
I would love for your to review Rich Lux’s new palette!
I remeber him saying that he is not using Botox, he just stopped moving his forehead....and now it has been Botox all along :D
I love new real nobotox shorthair eyebrowed tanned Jeffree💯👏🏼🔥💃🏼
You look more young and genuinely happy Ms Jeffrey and I love it. Love lots 😚😚
Yeah, it's about time Jeffree. I miss your review's.
Watching this brought me back🥰 and put a smile on my face! I’ve missed these reviews from Mr. Star! 😘🤩
Sorcery Indeed, America on cusp Halloween Season so Jeffrey’s Ga-Ga description befitting.  Weather-Wise Will apologize if no longer politically correct, but to quote my childhood, “Indian Summer”: Wind wisped Leaves, skies of blue, the clouds puffy white and crisp as a handpicked apple the temperature at night. 🍁   When I was small in the 70’s you could count on this extra bonus bout of Sweater Weather. Now often here in the MidWest, Mother Nature extremes from Summer Hot to Winter Cold without her pause for the pleasure of Fall 🍂   August 2022 I was in an Uber, destination Soldier Field in Chicago to see my All-Time favorite band, The Red Hot Chili Peppers 🌶   My Uber driver informed me that Lady Ga Ga was also performing that same night on opposite end of town in a Chicago big arena.  “The Windy City” as a Chicago is known, buzzed an energy inside it’s End of Summer breeze and freely mingled and ministered to those who Turned Up and Tuned In a night to never forget.  Beyond any man-made rules and opinions of Religion are concepts that connect us all as People of the Planet Earth in Positive Principals  Music is The Universal Language And Mother Nature’s Natural Wonders Heal the Soul  RHCP basest Flea is often quoted his parting words at end of show, “Be kind to each other.”  Soon enough Winter’s pale complexion to find my face fading the sun kissed days of present and this go-to weatherproof wearable veil a ✔️   These my own feelings unrelated to foundation will be the reason I DO purchase Ga Ga formula   That-And That It Is, Officially: Jeffree Star Approved 👏 💫
Always that bi$h 🤟🙌
i can't get over him having eyebrows  💀
Give us a tour of your beauty room!
You look so amazing ❤
Iconic
I can’t believe they just let you into the   kitchen area. That’s hilarious. Good video. Btw I’m picking up that eyeshadow liquid.
Hey Jeffrey can you do an atomic Shake Lady Gaga lip lacquer review? It looks like patent leather that doesn't transfer on your lips and looks amazing really wanted to get your take on it
Oli London looks so good here
Does it matter?
🎉glad you brought this back to you tube. I just can't do tickets snapshots etc. Its just tooooo much.  So I was happy to see you bring this to YT
Sending love to you Mista Starrrr ❤️
Jeffree you are looking HOT AF right now. Can’t wait to see what is coming next for you and JS cosmetics. ♥️ I have mature dry skin and am on the hunt for a good foundation that is skin like, illuminating and nourishing. Did I miss the liquid eyeshadow release?

I can only love the make up reviews now!  I’m happy he is happy but I can’t support his yak meat business. And I don’t buy his make up anymore.
Just living my life through jeffree because I can't afford these products 🤣🤣
From all the foundations you’ve reviewed this has been really sorcery’s material 🥶 your skin helps a lot but thats a HIT 🫶🏽✌🏽
Anyone tried it with combination skin yet? I currently use Huda but she still wants to slide off my face after a day of wearing 😭
Jeffree! You’re glowing! You look great 👍 😊💗 Wyoming has been good for you!
Waiting for jeffree star foundation 😍 😍 😍
GLOW UP.  Love you Ms. Star ❤
Am I the only one who is surprised that lady Gaga used the word fire? I'm wondering if she has someone writing for her.
gorgeous!
This hair look is killing me in the absolute best way
i knew we could always count on you for a helpful makeup product review
love to see you like this. you look amazing Jeffree ❤✨
Great review, haus labs are killing it! Looking good and healthy Jeffree, eyebrows and the outdoors suit you so much.
Please review the New collab  Beutycreations x Rosy Mcmichael Please!!!!!!!!
I’m sorry Jeffree but imo this was one of the worst foundations you’ve tried since I’ve been watching your reviews- I didn’t think it looked good at the start but when you showed it in the restaurant I was convinced it was awful.
Not jeffree living his kris jenner era😂😂😂

Mister JSC has that face for the Hungergames
Pretty sadening whole beauty community on YouTube is dead

What bathroom did you use
Jeffree looks like he wears foundation without wearing foundation. With foundation he looks like a mannequin 😮🔥
omg the views are dead 😫
It looked good dewy and peachy but in a good way plus your face matched the track suit....super cute
That Mirror fnif
The evolution of his makeup has style over the last couple years is amazing!
I came here from not watching you for almost two years I'm so happy to see you be better, good job, looking good!
You look amazing jeffree, like less 'perfect and plastic' if you will.. you still look perfect but more natural. Love it!!
OmG that looks really good 😃

The natural Jeffrey I love it
The way Jeffree pronounces arnica. 😆 love him
Please don’t abandon YT. It is my preferred platform. I don’t use TT, I fell off Instagram, and does anyone still use Facebook?
Jeffree is literally glowing from the inside out! Self love and inner peace is so important!
I miss makeup videos.   But baby you look FABULOUS 💖 😍 ❤️ ❣️ 💕 💘 💖
Is it me or did Jeffree get younger?!?!?!
I enjoy your makeup reviews so much!!! Always serving your authentic opinion! Yes come through Miss Gaga 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Missed u jeffree !
Jeffrey looks so good without the fillers and botox. Im'a get that foundation because it looks amazing
Blonde is back! I love you Jeffree 💚  it's so hard for me to get used to the brows on you lol. I got used to you not having any and bringing the make up higher. Also I think your crease looked more defined. I'm so  happy for your transformation. You are a such a  beautiful person, I always knew you were.
YAY
Te extrañé ❤
This looks like oily skin makeup wearers would HATE it. Makes jeffree's skin look dewy and cute. Would make mine look like it's covered it grease.
You look great, natural beauty rules
The Mexican music in the background at the restaurant 😅
U look amazing Jeffree
You look amazing. And that foundation is fire.
QUEEN IS BACK! Love the new Jeffree
The Mexican music in the background 🔥
Love ❤

Your nails are beautiful 😍
Why didn't you treat the restaurant to a makeover....sure...or they can make you over to a Wyominian...😂🙃😉😃
love the doggy appearance 🐶
You look great!
Whatever that you've got going on in Wyoming, it's *all* agreeing with you. You not only look great (you've never looked better), you sound great. Your aura has really changed. Continued success and happiness to you, JL. 🤗💓
You look so healthy and real! Love it!
You are absolutely 💯 so gorgeous 😍!!!!!!!!
I do miss the reviews I'm sad it is only sold at sephora.
Finally something not for sale.
aesthetics
Dayum!!  I wish I looked like you after my makeup!!!  You are S.T.U.N.N.I.NG. Sis!!!!  ✨❤✨
I love jeffree even more now because he loves himself and you can tell 😊
Love seeing the natural texture ❤️💖 love love love it I’m buying some soon!!!
i missed this  so much...... you look so happy and healthy......  love the formula on u
Bitch you look amazing😍
Pls keep the JS reviews on YouTube ! 🌸
Jeffree giving hot & healthy 🙌
did you get sunburnt?
If you like the Tom ford brow gel, Try the bobbi brown new brow shaper! There great and have so many shades
Wyoming is doing you some good!  Eyebrows and more natural look...is WOW
I love how much the peach eyeshadow and natural makeup look makes your hazel green? POP!
Jeffree, I can tell how much happier, more relaxed, and more authentically you have become in Wyoming! 💗 Wyoming looks stunning on you. 💋 And I love the Tom Ford brow gel and the new foundation from Lady Gaga looks stunning. 😍
Love it! Thanks boo! BTW obsessed with the eyes today! What contacts are these babe?
I just love you so much!!! Bitch I missed you!
Time for a Rich Lux makeup video! Will it be Jeffree Star approved?? Hopefully we'll find out....👍👍♥️♥️
Missed this videos. Just love you
Yeeessss I’m living thanks for the comeback!!!! Also the foundation looks very natural
Don’t love it..
Haus Labs is using reviews of their products in their ads WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE CREATOR, AND they even take BAD reviews (where the product does not work on them) edit them and put them in their ads AS IF THE CREATOR APPROVES OF THE PRODUCT.  IF THEYRE GREAT WHY LIE?
GAGA NEVER DISAPPOINTS😭😭🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Looking forward for JSC and Haus of Gaga collaboration. 👑
Jeffree despite everyone being so damn small minded you really look great. But it’s not about that. You said you’re physically feeling well. This is all we wanna see. Keep living a happy life: That’s what it’s all about.
While the foundation is very good.. The foundation does contain a lot of Silicones. More than 10. Which is a bit much. And I haven't seen much youtubers talking about it.   No wonders why in a few months people are going to complain about theirs skin being all messed up.
I got mine the other day and tried it today and loved it. Very nice feel to it. My color match it pretty spot on. Had my boyfriend with me to help me get the right shade. I love that he goes shopping with me and actually enjoys it. He’s so amazing that way.
You are looking absolutely gorgeous Jeffree! 😍 The foundation looks beautiful ❤️
Honey! GaGa needs to send you all her upcoming products because I just trust your reviews! You look so healthy and happy! Way to go!! 😍
I can already tell by that dewy glow, oily skin peeps would not like this foundation. I'd be trying to blot off all that shine.
Please Jeff more makeup reviews!! I love the JS approves or not videos!😉
Please Jeffree keep doing your YouTube videos, because me and others that i know don't like TikTok.
You are glowing baby!! Looking good 😍
Yay! I saw the tiktok review & was like please do a yt video!!!
I know it's trendy now but I will never buy a complexion product boasting skincare benefits. It's hard enough to find a good foundation that works, and it's hard enough to get acclimated to new skincare. So taking two things I'm sensitive to//needing to try out many different types of is a double whammy.
Yay love these videos. Hope u do more of these. ❤
Sooooo... When are you & Gaga going to collab again? 👀
I LOVE YOU BITCH! We missed you!!!
Jeffree hear me out you should make a doll head that comes in a lot of skin tones that comes with makeup and wigs
Hi jeffree how are you
I’m not living in her background choice. She is too far and look so F orange. I prefer the old one.
I love this foundation.  It’s so good! 😊
Jeffrey’s ranch life looks so good on him. He’s tan!!
gwoorl get your ass to reviewing r.e.m beauty CONCEALER!
I just bought 10 foundation shades thanks to jefree . Pay him Gaga!
Jeffree Star you are the Queen 👑 you are the big deal! Loved the video and Lady Gaga new foundation is amazing loved it !!!

we are still waiting for that rare beauty review 🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m living for the eyebrows!
You look gorgeous ❤
You should a review on Colour Pops Hocus Pocus 2 make up review next. Just in time for ALL HALLOWS EVE OR HALLOWEEN 🎃
Bitch, this is the review I've been waiting for, what took you so long?
You literally are glowing. I’m sorry if this makes it seem like you weren’t glowing before…but I feel like we didn’t even realize how GLOWING you could be. Like holy cow (yak, lol) you look really good
U look AhMazing  Jeffree! Wow! Before and After makeup, but to see u in ur more authentic form is so nice, I think getting tf outta Cali really took u to a new level!
I don't have tik tok and never will so thank you for putting this up on youtube!
this is the best foundation i have ever seen, i neeeeeed it
I really like the natural jeffree star. Really suits you and you look so healthy and happy.
I haven't watched JS in a long time and I now see that you have EYE BROWS! When did it all grow back?  Fabulous with the brows!!!
Omg Jeffree is looking GOOD
You look well.
The motherfuckin moment
Love it
Jeffree you look so healthy and energetic!!!!
I have missed you and your reviews!  ❤ love you and I am so happy for you and your world in Wyoming
Although Jeffree is somewhat detached from the reality of the working woman, (common in rich people who are consumed in the heart from a startup), I enjoy these reviews. Reminds me of the old times and i hate the shortening like a tiktok clip, I will always love Mr. ⭐️ <3
Please continue with the reviews on YouTube ! I hateee tiktok reviews because everything goes by so fast. So many cuts in the video to squeeze all the content into 1-3 mins on tiktok and this just makes it hard to watch
Jeffree you're more beautiful than ever!!!!!!!! Stunning!!! ❤❤❤
Omg if you start doing reviews again on here I will be so happy!!
I miss this type of videos
Lol I didn’t even know she had came out with anything
You look great in that foundation and powder. Thank you for the blood orange mascara, I love it!
🙃🙃🙂🙂😘😘♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Welcome back jeffreestarr💜💜💜love u from the Philippines
I used to be a scriber but lost you when you broke up with the young guy that didn't have tattoos then got them with you then one of your dogs died. It's been awhile good to see you back , out of l.a. too
I don't even wear make up but I enjoy watching your videos.
We need the Jeffree Star Cosmetics foundation.
Absolutely love the makeup reviews ❤So glad ur back at it
Love the mirror, I want one now.   As far as TSA, I’m sure you won’t have a problem. As long as the edge is blunt and not serrated.
The green nails calls my name 💚💚💚
Do REM and Half Magic Beauty next!!

I love his foundation reviews because he goes out in town and ask people for review like a casual daily vlogger which is very calming
No matter what the comments say jeffree will always do jeffree. HOWEVRR BITCCHHH!! You are SNATCHED af bby!!! Im loving every second of this. cant wait for you and shane to do another series. i mean come on it has to be coming "ya'll". "Wy-oming takes shane ryland" lol
Too cute. Loved the review.  Welcome back, yakkiity yak, talking back. Lol. Yes I'm old and remember songs older than you are.
His skin looks amazing before he even applied anything 😍
You look like a  professional gorgeous grown up ♡! ! Stunning!!  congrats to you♡ Now, easy on the rays- skin cancer kills.. Lmk when ur ready to get rid of a pink car or 3... MY TEEN daughters got me ur F proof mascara. MR& MRS STARR, IT'S NOT 🥵HUMIDITY,🔥 Nor HOT 💁🏼‍♀️🦳FLASH,  proof😅.However... some  of us are  gonna get slammed by a hurricane , thus no shopping:( but you fid not expect LESS from Gaga ,did you!!
Thank you so much. Your reviews are very important to me and I don’t have TikTok. It looks like a great foundation!  Thank you 🙏🏻 ❤🙏🏻💜
I wish other YouTubers and celebrities would take note of Jeffree removing his lip filler. It looks so natural and nice
I like the light eyes much better!
I am excited for this!!! &&&& #alwayZ, gorgeous my friend!!!
Thaaaaank you.  This is what we love.  Not the quick tiktok review like James Charles did.  Not the youtube short.  Some things don't have to be reinvented.   I like to come home after work or during a chill weekend, grab a drink, sit back, and just enjoy!
For us phone users who watch videos can you scooch the camera a tad closer so I can see your makeup a tad better please?
Looks good! I might give it a try! Thank you! I'm glad you're doing well. It's amazing how much life can change, isn't it? My entire life has changed since December and I'm feeling and looking better than ever too. Here's to the journey!
Love the eyebrows,  so beautiful and softness. Absolutely: Marry her look
I'm loving the new Jeffree Star!  Experience
The match is impeccable ❤
JEFFREE!! Soooo glad to see your GLAMOROUS SELF !! 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋     MORE VIDEOS✨ 🙏🏼✨✨✨✨✨✨
Kinda plastic but a lil real.
Who the hell cares about Lady Gaga
1 love the cleaver intro  2 a lot of us old hoes don’t have the other socials  like the insta hoe , snap slap or slut tokk
Yayy!! YouTube review!! Thank you Jeffree!
You are a national treasure.
I love these reviews from you and miss them! You look fabulous and I love your authenticity. Been a fan for years so this makes me so happy!
What we've all been missing!!! Give us more!!!
What we've all been missing!!! Give us more!!!
I’m so happy for you J..you seem like you are in such a better place both mentally and physically. You seem excited to be doing YouTube videos again. You are radiating good energy. I like this jeffree
Not Jeffree looking like the true  immortal vampire  he is by completely doing a 360.  He looks just  the first time  I saw in his first YouTube video
This guy is so true to his self.  Love him 😄 Was Rosio Durcal in the background at the restaurant?
Please do a full face of Bobbi Brown she literally has everything
the eyebrows. still not use to it. haha
He is like secret shame enjoyment thank God for this video
Perfect match! Flawless.
nothing's right with this stupid hairstyle.
I went and bought it when I saw you post on tiktok. It really is great!
Always love watching you and the makeup and your products. You are just amazing..keep doing videos and  makeups. Enjoy life and be happy
Jeffery, thanks for listening that not all of us use Tik Tok. We've missed the reviews!
Oh wow how beautiful do you look!! Happy healthy and glowing! Thank you for posting here!
okay i still can't get over Jeffrey's new look  yet  AND  THE EYEBROWS ...!!!!!😲 Omg  girl you look stunning 😍 😍😍❤❤❤
You’re radiating such a healthy and happy energy it’s making me emotional 🥹 I’m so happy for you ❤
jeffree we miss you over here!
WOW JEFFREY... . YOU LOOK AND SOUND AMAZING!
WAIT WERE UR EYES ALWAYS MULTICOLORED GREEN BLUE TURQUOISE LIKE DO THEY CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WEAR? Ur eyes r a great color. If you wear colored lenses I do too cuz I love changing my look. Although I noticed I love my natural eye color MORE and more when I forget what it looks like after using only colored contact lenses for months.
I’m obsessed with youuuuuuuu and high
Im loving the new jeffree.
I'm loving your brows, i need to get new foundation, but i always buy the wrong color, any advice on how to pick the right one?
Just slicing all the air with the cleaver, making pies out of it
You look amazing!!! And so happy !!
is it just me or the lighting seems off?
Love it and you truly seem happy! Yay!
Love you 🤗🌴🏝
New layout video ? I see u crop little bit at side and top
I hope he comes out with a lighter brow product, I can't find anything lighter than my brows, which are supposedly "blond" according to the brow mascara that doesn't change the color of them😂
Jeffree coming back to do the lords work.
Finally! Also, JS looking so much younger is such a glow up.
Yesss my cleaver mirror was in my carry-on! I chose an agent that had fly makeup on, knew she'd understand "I know how this looks…"  She appreciated the heads-up & wanted to know where to get one!🔪💄 Please make a travel case!!
Geeee I missed these reviews!!!! I love it ❤❤❤
I love you so much, and Chris's video work, that foundation on your skin looks incredible 😲🤩
SLAYYYYY
You Look Amazing Jeffre...
Love the look of it!
You can't take the country out of the grrls, honey! I'm a country farm girl and we have this healthy glow that can't be beat! You are an inspiration,  Jeffree! Love you, Miss Thing! ❤️

I’m loving the new and improved Jeffree 😍. That foundation looks so good that I really hope I’m not allergic to it 😂 ⭐️
You look so happy 😀
Jefree miss thing look into tretinoin you’ll thank me later. You’ll never need Botox again. Well, maybe if you would like to when you get older you can. But believe me tretinoin is the shit. Also never forget sunscreen!!!!!
Very glad to see reviews are back!😀💜
SO HAPPY YOURE HAPPIER !!! Missed these reviews so much
My queen is back🥰🫶🏻
Jeffree ....you look...peaceful...
i love how humble he is now
☺️☺️😍😍😍🙃🙃🙃
I already bought the foundation and yes it is absolutely beautiful!
The New Jeffree looks good on him. I’m so happy that you have found happiness! You look absolutely beautiful. I agree with the Haus labs makeup it’s of the hook. Sending love ❤️ 😊
i wanna see the sheglam review👀
you need to do a  Collaboration with the one and only lady Gaga I would love to see you do her make up Jeffery star
OMG….I have missed your reviews so much. I had actually thought about trying the powder and after your review I def will try this.
You are absolutely ** *glowing* ** !!   Must ask: what brand is your contact lens'? I have dark brown eyes and it's so hard to find a good light colored contact lens.   Welcome back, much love 🥰
super confused why he didnt like his eyebrows in the first place but i totally understand why im suddenly sexually attracted to jeffrey star LOL. yeah i love the new look you look cute asf.
You look so healthy! Happy for you ❤❤
Everyone is sleeping on Hard Candy GLAMOFLAGE foundation. I can’t believe it’s no viral yet. I’ve tried so many & it’s my new holy grail!
'Kind of plastic but a little bit real' iconic lol.
Still on this 2016 type of content and wonders why his channel is dying 😂
I’m eyeing the highlighters she put out too. That pink one would make a great blush. Foundation looks amazing on you!
You don't wear wigs anymore??
Extrañaba esto i missed this
Listen. Your highlighter is amazing. ❤
Sweet heart you look so fantastic right now, your skin, those flawless brows. You glow. With health-thank you to all your baby yak friends! I feel less like I need to come chef for you-your body clearly likes lack of fast food, and we can all see what the lifestyle change has brought about.💜
Some of us don't do ticky tok. Please don't forget about the peeps with longer attention spans over here on the tube :/    WE MISS YOU! Ps  loving the eye color 🤩
glad to see a new videos :) You look great ;) Love your dogs . x
Yay! I missed you! The new Jeffree is awesome.  You are gorgeous!

jefferee in the kitchen asking staff  😹
Can I just say... I love the new Jeffree!!!
A happy healthy Jefree is everything ❤️
Gotta say, your skin color, texture, and overall health in general just looked so GREAT even before makeup. Glad you are eating healthy and out in the sun, living your best life!❤
Mr. Starr, Wyoming so agrees with you.  Your looking healthy and happy.  ❤❤❤
You go Jeffrey!  I love this life you’re living. ❤
I wasn’t excited about this brand when it launched on Amazon and not excited about it on Sephora. I am tired of all the “celebrity” makeup brands. Nice to see a review on YT. Some of us don’t have social media.
I'm going to buy this foundation.
Yessss I miss you tube videos
Bitch lets talk about the nails tho 💅
LOOKING YOUNGER💅
❤❤❤
You just keep looking better and better !! So impressed!
Congrats to dana_tatt for getting her 15 seconds of fame lol
🌹😍💕😘 Loooove U Jeffree ⭐️🌟✨✨✨
Jeffree! I never comment on videos, but you look amazing and happy here! Love this so much for you.
Ms. Jeffree Lynn is glowing ❤️
You look fabulous as always @jeffree star. Im livin for this review, the foundation and setting powder looks beautiful 😍 ✨
I love it it looks so good !!!
Welcome back queen!! I love the reviews on tiktok and also in here!!! Love that you give a wear test here!
I don’t see wrinkles lol
I was like why does he look so good and then he pointed out his eyebrows, tan, and no lip filler. He looks great!
You look great!
*You look like Kris Jenner*
Where's the Jeffree star foundation ?!?
YouTube always please
Not a fan of the coloring of the video. Looks like the reds are pushed up way too much.
Just love watching your videos amazing as always
Lol I love that huge mirror knife
Yes tsa will let you i flew with it on my carry on
Why can't I get sound?? 😭😭
You can tell your in a better place you look amazing ❤
10:00 ur skin is not "perfect" as you used to say, anymore! pores like a volcano! not about botox.... u youtubers r so fake!
YAY! YouTube jeffrey!!!
I was waiting for this video for a long time, but… let me tell you that I’m so happy for you and your new way to see yourself, you’ve been growing up as a person and I’m glad you’re trying new things with your body, skin, food, and everything you’ve changed, love you for ever ❤❤❤❤
I missed these kind of videos where it’s about makeup with a little life update. Stopped following Jaclyn cause she doesn’t even do makeup anymore. It’s constant “life journeys”. Wish her well but I honestly don’t care to watch her walk a treadmill for 2 mins and then go stuff her face at an expensive restaurant
Im living for the healthy glow jeffree!   And loving the jade green nails!! Ooo is that a nod to the next collection 😁
Finally a makeup review in a very long time. And so happy with the interaction he has with the restaurant staff.
Digging the new look! 🌟
Will you be doing a review of the kylie and kris collection ?
Hi Jeffrey is the your real eye color... So gorgeous pale green😻 Stupid of me
I'm so jealous You could live as a guy cause your so goddamn good looking  AND then, AND THEN,  B-B-BAM,  YOU'RE FREAKING BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!! in make-up.   Girl,  GIRL  you are beautiful!  You have really grown-up so much over the last couple of years.  I love your FUN maturity.
Wow! Such a stunning foundation! I'm so tempted to purchase and give this baby a whirl 💫 I miss sitting down with you and coming along your review journeys so thank you so much for quenching our thirst with some real TEA ☕️ We miss you so much Jeffree Lynn 😘 Can't wait for the next one! Love seeing you live your best Wyoming life, miss thing! Until next time 💋
Wow, you have such stunning eyes Jeffrey Star!
Can you review the rest of the haus labs line?
Love how prices are called out when jsc prices are jus the same if not more
Thank you for thinking of us, I feel like I’m too old for TikTok
Hi They Them
You look amazing Jeff
Where do you buy her foundation at??
we need r.e.m and rare beauty 🤌🏻🤌🏻
😍♥️
WHOS WATCHING DAHMER ON NETFLIX?  I’m binging it over the course of the week. It’s so good. Jeffree star used to have the same name, but allegedly they are not related. We need proof before we verify that. As always Jeffree makes the most unique, attractive, and functional makeup. I met him a few times and have always loved him regardless of what the internet says. Sure at times maybe I was upset and took a step back but seeing him now is amazing!
❤👏👏👏
Wow! Loving the new Jeffery.   Gorgeous!   ❤️🇨🇦
You look amazing as always!
I’m not even a fan of gags, but I love Jeffree and TBH the new Haus Labs foundation really held up pretty nice!  I also enjoy the new Jeffree!! ✨
wow that does look very nice ! I am a cosmo very nice!
ngl. I have been watching JS for years and I can definitely see how much you grow. You honestly seem so much happier ever since you move away from LA. You seem more healthier. It makes me really happy to see that growth.
Jeffree! Are you growing your hair out again?
It’s reminds me of the Dior Backstage foundation
She’s back!,
U had surgery ? Hmm
Jeffree looking younger then ever. Eyebrows on point 👌🏻
I would love to see you review mikayla paht 2 makeup
Jeffrey miss the makeup reviews. Holiday is coming and I am hoping you will be doing those @jeffreestar
I love this look on you!! You are more gorge now with eyebrows & no lip filler. You look TRUELY happy!  Boy Jeffree is as beautiful as Fem Jeffree.
I love this review!!  I was wondering about the foundation and it looks great on you ☺️
I love the new real JefFree! Really living up to the free bitch!! So happy for you and your team!
love it
Looking good Jeffree! ❤☀️
The foundation looks beautiful I definitely want to try it. I am so happy you put the review on YouTube because I am not on tiktok. How does the foundation work with the Jeffree Star setting powder?
YESSSSS i missed these so much <3
Hi Jeffree my iPhone 6s Plus for years has been already dying, love your new iPhone and your look love you 🎉 sending love from the Philippines ❤
I just don't get it. 1st you put a darkish foundation on and it looked good bit than you put (to me)ALOT of the lightest concealer,and now you look light you have spots.
Omg loving the new jeffreee post moreee we want moreee we need moreee we love youu 🥰💋
The best part about this video is seeing how happy and healthy Jefree is 🥰
Wyoming looks good on you. You seem more relaxed and comfortable than ever.
Beauty, glitz and glamour aside I would really love a audiobook or podcast or something of you teaching business, tips to success in finances. You have such an awesome story of the true meaning of American dream where working your ass off you really can do anything. But I feel so many of us just have no idea even where to start. It doesn't have to be beauty related, just anything in growth for personal success and professional success .
I think I’ll spend the $45. It seems like a foundation that I’ve been searching for. Thanks Jeffree  for the review.
I love these reviews!❤️😘
I trust your judgment on make then anyone else. You keep it real.
I need a Jeffree x Lady Gaga collab
Having a hard time looking at the concealer when you have such awesome brows and lips! Happy for you jeffree! I really am. Fuck the rest.
Yayyy 🥰🥰🥰
Yesss the reviews are back 😍👏🏼❤️
I was just binge-watching your older videos and the difference from then and now is night and day. Whatever it is you are doing Jeffree, keep it up!
Pls review REM beauty 🥺
Look you amazing!! SO happy and proud of you. ❤️
I love how they are playing Mexican music in the background
This is what I love these reviews 😍 When you go after A brand for not having A good product,bonus!!
You're back. Happy for this video. Love what you do and your charitable heart. Wyoming is doing wonders for you
I love you.
Please tell me your protecting those incredible  tattoos from the sun while your enjoying the country life.
I LOVE YOU
Wyoming jeffery is my favorite iteration so far
Wow. My skin has gotten lighter and Jeffree is getting darker. Wtf.
Really glad that you reviewed this product as I ordered it a few days ago after hearing a lot of positive feedback.   I really like your look today. Love the natural hair and no wig today. Looks great!
What highlighter are you wearing 🤔🧐
Why he kinda looking like my grandma.
JS is so awkward and that's why Nathan left him. You know it's bad when someone leaves you because they rather be alone than with you lmfao.
I truly miss your reviews on youtube
Jeffree is glowing and looking so happy and healthy! Love to see it! 💜
my combination of foundation and powder costs under 8 euro's. thats seriously over 75 euro's less expensive............. (as dollars and euro's are like the same now) and i already find that expensive to be honest. but ofcourse you will never care about someone like me STEFANIE !
OMG Jeffree your makeup is ALWAYS perfect and I LOVE❤ your reviews
I seen the TikTok review but I love a OG YouTube review!!!
You have to try the lip products!!!! Lipstick and gloss in one that doesn’t budge and the lip oils!!!!!!!!❤
Can you restock Magic Star in shade C7 please
you look like nicktron
Your eyebrows look so nice grown out! I love wearing this foundation! I’ve been waiting for your review! It looks great on you!!
❤
Can't wait for his hair to grow back to at least a bob
Wonder if Jeffree Star brings out a better foundation 😜
It’s so refreshing to see jeffree so happy with his natural self, he is working that forehead wrinkle , natural lips , and natural eyebrows!! Jeffree you look so stunning and glowing as yourself it bring me so much joy to see
Jeffrey get your ass back on here, we’ve missed ya! 🎉
Again, gawfahs here, no, let's NOT slap Jeffree today.
You look amazing. Better than ever.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
just so you know ''gaga''  as one of your original, MOST GENUINE fans, foundation of just 3 euro's is perfect for me !
Yaaaaas this is the kind of Jeffree Star post I am here for
45 dollars ?????????? yea like that's really what GAGA stood for... CHANGE YOUR NAME FAKE GAGA !!!!!!!!!!
To think that 20+ yrs ago Matthew Shepherd was brutally murdered in WY for being gay and now, this beautiful blonde boy is living his best life in the same state. How far we’ve come. 😍
Not that Jeffree needs any more money hehe...but I've often wondered if he has ever reached out to someone or a company that had new products and had them pay him to do these reviews. Cause I have often wondered when something is Approved...does it effect their sales in a big way? I know a long time ago when he did the review of the eyeliner from Dollar General omg it took me ages to find one that had any in stock lol! Love ya Jeffree <3
You should do more YouTube reviews please 🥺
I’ll be @ Sephora tomorrow morning sharply at 10:00am..just direct me to the Haus Labs foundation and powder! I’ll tell them Jeffree Star sent me! My God you look amazing! THRIVE bitch!!! You are def living your best ever! Damn…I’m in the wrong state!
I wish, I could be able to afford her foundation..😥
I absolutely love this new happier Jeffrey. You’re glowing! Wyoming is totally you.
BTW those up close shots to the face  really proved you are so so so handsome you don't even look human. And I love the green eyes. This foundation is to dye for on you ! I hope it's good on dry skin too
I just love you!
wow this is AMAZING ! you saying that a make up brush is too expensive, and especially Lad gaga's brush... wow that really says something and to me that's real proof that the real gaga doesn't exist anymore. the real gaga stood for such other things... she always said she's not a celebrity and she doesn't care about the money. thank you so much Jeffree for always being so honest ! as you are very rich yourself, that's really amazing !
Jeffree, not often luv, but you had me laughing at the fake butcher knife going through TSA being a conversation starter!
Jeffree my star ⭐ you belong on YouTube. Missed you here ,I love the journey your on . Keep shining 🌟
I missed your videos so much! I love your reviews. You are literally one of the only people I trust with product reviews because if you say it’s good… it’s GOOD! You are looking so healthy and refreshed. Im so happy for you 🖤🖤
You look amazing! 💗💗
Girl I’m sorry but your side part is way too much on the side in my opinion, you should move it up about two inches in my opinion! 🙃
I love this new look of Jeffree, you look so happy and that's the most important thing.
it looks good with the white hair, I don't know if it would be as good a combo with darker hair
Oh noooo not "amica cream" 😂😂😂😂😂😂 i wonder if it "covers bruises"   we all know its arnica but damn I just had to say it!!!!
That mirror!!! I love it!
Jeffree you are so beautiful baby. looking better than literally EVER!
New Jeffree > old Jeffree 👏👏👏👏
It's hard for me to even judge any form of cosmetic on someone who I find to be so naturally beautiful...the way I see it in my opinion is that YOU MAKE THE COSMETIC LOOK BEAUTIFUL!! But I sure love the beauty tips they help me tremendously Jefree! Thanks ♡☆♡☆♡☆♡
THIS is what WE love jeffree. Your fanbase is HERE
yes, definitely more youtube videos instead of on other social media please.
💖💖💖💖💖💖
Thank you for putting your videos on you tube. I'm 51 and don't miss a post, but I don't do tic toc.  I'm appreciate your honest reviews.  Lost my dog 2 months ago and have never been so sad in my life.
Kate moss cosmoss review next.
Love this video 💜
If they send the PR would you do a rebrand review of the other products?
I just LOVE YOU JEFFREE! I just get misty eyes 👀 when I watch you. My son looks exactly like you, and I don't get to see him much, so when you're on it's like I'm watching him!
I love it
PRAISE THE LORD for a conventional video review! Please don't jump over the cheap content influencer bandwagon trend with those hideous and pointless 60 seconds TikTok / Shorts reviews. YOU ARE BETTER THAN THEM.
Now in Wyoming, is it more dry air? Also, has your skin changed at all? Good to know for future wear tests.
I love me some Jeffee ❤
Hooray thanks for doing this on YT!
Thank you for the review your skin is to dye for
My daughter brought her mirror in her bag and failed to mention this to me! The one guy at TSA literally stopped what he was doing and says "uh, i think we have a problem here. Who's backpack is this?!". They scanned it again and he's like "it's fine, it's just a mirror". 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I need more Jeffree videos
@Jeffree Star what do you think about Brad Pitt's new skin care line? Are you going to review it? It's expensive AF 🥴
❤❤❤❤
Dont u dare leave us here! U look so good and so healthy, I'm proud of u. I hope so u'll record some Q&A video, I'd like to know more about ur new lifestyle :)
I know I’m not the only one that’s missed miss jeffree lynn’s reviews! Wyoming has done wonders for you Jeffree and you’re just glowing and look so happy! lots of love!🥰
Where I can find it?
Amazing.
Best reviewer of all time! Honest, thorough, entertaining, and REAL! I missed these 💕
Thanx for not forgetting us on YouTube. I refuse to consume Tik Tok at all. Anything intertwine with the CCP is a no chance in hell for me.
Thumbs down because you reviewed it first on tik tok!
😅please always keep posting videos on YouTube as well as Tik tok ❤
Your nails <3  0:42 Love that sound!
I love your pomeranians!!😍
Yeah you gotta stick with YouTube I don’t do that stupid tiktok crap!!!
I didn’t think he would approve her, good to see he gave an honest review
Wow you look amazing!!!!! So happy for this update!
oh i’ve missed THIS Jeffree. comeback QUEEN
These new haus labs products are amazing tbh
I was watching all your make up review videos from 3-4 years ago because I missed your videos sooo much!!! You look amazing Jeffrey!!
1 your wrinkles are invisible. 2 you are absolutely glowing and thriving and I am so relieved and happy you're on this journey. Sending much love 💖
He said he got his fillers dissolved but I can still see it in the skin below his nose, it’s still puffed up from the migrated filler.
That "I used to be a ghost" got me dead 🦖
Since you now get a tan more often then when you were in LA would you do some videos for keeping skin healthy during summer months? You look happy and healthy.  Wyoming was definitely your calling.
Jeffrey: I’m so tannnn  Me: and yet still the palest bitch I’ve ever seen XD
Well, it’s about DAMN time Jeffrey.
I missed the sass. This was so cool. Plus the uncensored convo is life. All the other YT cover and beep everything while Jeffree : " I'm using the fuck proof mascara". 🤣🤣
Jeffree I am so happy you are looking so healthy. I was so worried about you and with everything you went through. Once I can work and my mom's divorce is over, I'll finally be able to try your yak meat. I'm excited for you on your new journey. Also beware of the government, now that you own a farm they may or not attack your farm. Other than that drama, I would love if you could make a video of cooking the meats and trying it. Idk how to season and cook it.
Novadays we are looking at new Jeffrey the Second. You look so energy, healthy and first of all happy. Hope all the best to your new life👍🏼🤩💋🥂❤ pss. Hugs to your lovely puppies 🐾
WEVE MISSED THIS ❤❤❤
Jeffree…. Yes, you look great my guy
wow jeffrees personality has changed so much. Also he would never use a shade like that in the past
Wow, Jeffree, you're looking amazing. Hope you're feeling amazing inside too!
please try the haus labs 15 second lip stain gloss thing!!
Loved the video!  And you look stunning as always!  💖💖💖
I missed your reviews! I keep hearing this foundation is IT !!!
I missed those review videos Jeffree, so good you're back 🔥

The whole video I was looking at him and thinking that somehow he's different. And then I noticed eyebrows
Loving the eyebrows 👍😘
You look so healthy & pretty! 😍

"We're just going to use a little bit, we don't need to go overboard"  *skips forward and he has it all over his face*  Lol. I love him
I'm impressed by this foundation, it looks amazing on a skin. Love the powder's packaging too. Thank you so much for the review ❤️
YOU IN THE KITCHEN OMG 😭  ilysm
JS, I love those nails, gosh ❤🥰
Yea definitely missed makeup reviews from my girl😭🥰!!! But I can’t get over the progress you continue to do for yourself so fucking inspiring!🔥👏🏼
Hi there 👋 love that your back ☺️ beautiful makeup look love everything you got 💗
I love that Jeffree's vlogging some lol
Your fuc*ing pretty!!!
dropping the filler and being out in nature a lot more dropped a good 10 years off your look. Congrats because whatever you are doing up in Wyoming is working.  Prob a lot more full sleep i bet. Also WTF were you doing ever shaving brows when you could beat them into that shape. lol,  Shaving brows is what you do when they are beyond repair.
Please review wet n wild new makeup! Good to have you back!
JS looking so good n nice glow on your skin..👍
Ребят, кто тут понимает, что я пишу?
So gd to see ur sexy face on doing a review. No one does it like u so effortless. Love u
hi I love you all ways
You are glowing! So refreshed and healthy I love it
Yaas missed Jeffree STAR reviews soo much also that foundation looks amazing!
Your skin is flawless! I’m jealous! I want to see how the foundation looks on ugly trash skin so I’d know how it’d look on mine 😆
I like this jeffrree star ❤
Bish your face is soooo glowy!!!! I’m deceased!!!
I LOVE your mirror!!!
Thank you for doing this on YouTube love you so much ❤️
I'm at work rinow but I'm SOOOO excited to get home and watch this later! I've missed JS/JSC makeup reviews and tutorials! Thanks to the Messiah Jeffree Lynn himself for gifting us with a review! Xoxoxox
I haven’t been here in about 2 or 3 years so I just gotta ask. When did Jeffrey get eyebrows😭
Star and GAGA!! Come on!!!! I couldn’t have asked for a better video! JS you look so HAPPY and THAT makes me so happy and so proud of you!!! I’m a farm gal and I’m so glad you’ve found a happy place for you heart mind and soul! Nothing is better than fresh air and animal husbandry!!!  I’ve been a fan for a long time baby and I’m just so happy for you❤❤❤
I’ve loved every Jeffree…. However 2022 Jeffree is by far my favourite ❤️
I need to stop eating out aswel.  You look great! What you eat in a day video please!!
Love to see you babe ❤
What happen to the microphone?
Your skin looks so good Jeffree!!! I loved this video, we need reviews on budget-friendly foundations. 😂 Love Gaga, but not sure I'd buy this every time.
I’m so early 🎉 I missed this Jeffree ❤️❤️ looking forward to more like this!!!
I am loving the foundation and powder
I  need a life update on here please
Is the sound so bad or is it my tv? 🤔
Your skin looks FLAWLESS!!!!! 🔥
thanks for the review!!!  incredible foundation !!!  I really want that.  It is very elastic and will definitely look cool on aged skin 👍👏👏👏👏🍀🇺🇦
10:19 „you look gay“ 😂😂😂😂😂❤
So good to see 😍😍😍 you look amazing
You are looking amazing!!!!!!!
You look sooo beautiful and your skin is GORGEOUS...❤️
When are we going to get the (star foundation?) It's time for Jeffrey to make us a foundation. We need a Dewey version as well as a mate version of foundation.
The foundation looks good on the on the skin
You look natural the haus!!!
Maybe it’s your pink robe….  You seen much more red than that color…..
Jeffree, I love the more natural look. You look healthy and still fire! Be proud of any wrinkles you have; many don't live long enough to get them.
I miss the long videos :(
Thank you so much for the review and for the wear test💖, the foundation looks amazing, very glowing and natural, I definitely would like to try it 💯
Your skin looks red. Sun burns permanently damage your skin. I used to live in the sun and I regret it because I have permanent sun damage.
When u have eyebrow... u dont need nothing. U are gorgeous now...
Jeffree you should know better to protect your wonderful face from the sun! 🌞
I truly loved this video, feels like very old days JF...please come to Barcelona, I wanna hug you so baaaad
I love your hair style it looks good on You
Facial hair!!!  Wow
So glad ur back. Missed u on YouTube. You are stunning. Been following u for 6 years and stuck through all the cancel bullshit they did to u. So fkn dumb. U look amazing and healthy. Love u Jeffree
Finally!! I was waiting for the YouTube review! I love ur IG and tiktok but your YouTube review is always the best.
aww, Drizzle baby 🥺💖
Maybe its just my settings but at the end you looked a little orange.. does that stuff oxidize at all?
Whatever Gaga does she kills it. Sh don’t give a fuck about she makes amazing products and makes shades for every type or person.
❤  love your review s your amazing
What are you done to your face you look so beautiful 🥵😍
The foundation looks amazing! thank you for the wear test 👍❤️
Your eyebrows look good on you! Definitely keep them. They enhance you’re makeup in my opinion.
Can you do another full face using the star wedding palette? I want to see you apply not just Swatch
You are amazing.
I missed these kind of videos!
i swear jeffree is looking younger and healthier as ever
Jeffree you look so healthy!!
Jeffree, you look better and better in every video..very sexy, no more botox, suits you perfectly..the vibe of your personality holds up better than botox..love your videos!!🤩
Love you with eyebrows!
I just love that meat cleaver mirror 😁❤️
Yes ❤️ I always love your reviews!
jeffree you better work it girl.🥰
for some reason reminds me of the La Mer foundation
SO GLAD YOURE BACK! I’ve been waiting on so many reviews
yeeeees! JS at it again!!! :3
Is it just me or does Jeffree look absolutely STUNNING ✨
I love the new Jeffrey you seem so genuinely happy and healthy. ❤️ I’m so happy for you.
Love that the powder is Talc Free!
OMG I am soooo glad 60FPS IS BACK YES! 🥲🥲🥲❤️❤️❤️🤩🥳🤩🥳🤩
Good to see you back. Your reviews have always been my favorite content of yours. 🎉😊
We missed you!!! You look so happy ❤❤
That is a beautiful finish. FrFr! I'm ordering it ASAP. Is the coverage good tho? Ur skin is perfect so it's hard to tell
Looks super cakey up close when you were in the bathroom
i really dislike this setup - its way to bright with the bright white light right behind jeffree.  Also the camara seems out of focus the whole time. i always love his videos but this absolutely blinded me 😂 (not in a good way)
Jeffree I am LIVING for your look. You are beautiful. I’m loving that you’ve eased up on the Botox, filler etc. you look so happy, fresh and radiant. Shine on!
This looks great I’m not seeing if the site ships to the uk? Does anyone no please?
Giiiiiirl pls review the whole New haus labs they have a lot of New stuff
You look fabulous, Jeffree 🥰💖
Yes!!!!!
🥰
Missed this!!! Tired of these influencers getting paid for there reviews and scamming the people
You look great! I’ve been eating better too and have more energy now lol makeup looks good too! 💅🏻🎸
Missed your reviews so much! ❤❤❤
The fact that he is trying to be even more natural, eating healthier and just being himself, inspires me so much! Thank u
REVIEW REM & RARE BEAUTY 😩💖
YASSSSS JEFFREE!!! Please keep the videos coming and do more reviews! We miss these videos!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜
The under eyes were a lil lined and I’ve never seen that on you
I fucking miss jeffreee Star on YouTube! Literally the best video I’ve seen in a while
Does he seem manic?
I LOVE IT!!! AND YOUR BROWS LOOKS FANTASTIC
I’ve been watching you for years…and took a break, due to work, but…omg girl…I love the HEALTHY version of you!!! You look so fab, and great review!!! Will definitely be getting it!!!
Jeffree is glowing. Is it the tan? Eyebrows? A good diet? I can’t pinpoint what it is. Something is different.🤔❤
You are looking SO healthy. I love the natural look with no lip fillers and eyebrows. Hair , all of it! ❤
Omg yayyyyy he's back 😍😍😍😍😍
wow, love the hair style and those green nails
Wonderful to see you look so fabulously happy ❤
Jeffree so hot with browssss
Jeffree! Since you don’t eat much fast food please share some of your favorite recipe ideas! Especially with your yak meat I have never made it or tried it 😅❤ I love how you are glowing 😩🥰
A lil plastic a lil real! Amen 😂
Yay!!! Happy to see 👀 you!!
Im so glad you're doing all these positive changes!!
This was awesome I totally prefer watching a YouTube video than a TikTok just because it’s too short like three minutes. ❤❤
Definitely missed the reviews but still miss regular tutorials too 😉  It's great to see Jeffree so healthy and tan 💕
I will watch every video you post anywhere and leave a like. Please do a full video for all reviews and use it to cut down into the short videos. This is what i call a review!
Who cares about the foundation.. Jeffree has eyebrows. 😮All the aliens are shook of the betrayal of their tribe. 😱
"hypoallergenic"   literally everyone with an almond allergy staring at the ingredient list of this foundation: 😭🤬
I thought you had gained some weight. You look great! You look healthy! Go you!
Jeffree, I can't believe you had the new foundation of makeup by my idol, Lady Gaga on this video, it's so sickening and the short hair is reminds me of Pink!!
More reviews!!
Jeffrey looks good!!!
I'm a cowgirl  who splits time between Wyoming, Idaho and Arizona. I love skincare and makeup but, sorry to say I've yet to try any of your products except for your Yak! It's so good! I strongly recommend!  I will get around to trying your makeup at some point. I mean, a girl needs to look good on the back of her horse! Giddy up y'all!
You look so healthy ! And seem so happy I love this new chapter in your life ❤️
Slay
The new jeffree is happier and healthier. Much better.
Jeffree!! I need more lifestyle videos from you! I’m so happy you’re thriving! ❤
Yesssssssss! A whole ass video! I am living for this and love it.
Pls do rem beauty by Ariana Grande
I’ve missed you Jeffree! I’m so happy you’re back❤
Why is the lighting making our Queen Lord Voldemort pink??
Lol people talking about age like that means you wouldn't have a certain app...I'm 37 and I have TikTok... But I deleted the app because of privacy concerns. Ty for sharing here! 💜🕉️
You look amazing ❤
Has he ever checked out makayla on TikTok??
Foundation shade: Trump
HE HAS EYEBROWS NOW?!?😳
jeffree is looking healthy and more beautiful then ever!!! 😍 💕 💖 ❤️ nothing gets better then a notification from one of my favorite youtubers ❤️
I’ve so missed these …. I don’t do tik tok so hope you do more on YouTube
I hate sitting there wasting time scrolling through tik tok I come you you tube to get straight to the point
Glad to see you back with reviews! That is one of the best foundations I have seen reviewed. Looks really nice. And if you don’t even know you are wearing it that makes it even better.
Tan jeffree is awesome haha I’m not used to it
DEITY!  If I could tell you how many other brands make money off being Jeffree Star Approved...!  I have saved HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS thanks to your honest reviews. I have also SPENT hundreds...but they were ALWAYS worth it. You have never steered us wrong and every single time I ran and bought something you approved...IT👏HAS👏WORKED👏  Thank You for bringing your review to YouTube, we sure do love & miss you!♡  And LOOOOOK, you are LITERALLY glowing! Your aura is so clean and BRIGHT!♡
I LOVE the hair and eyebrows with the healthy color! Looks fantastic (little jealous 😂)
Always enjoy a nice 😊 Fast-food visit with Jeffree STARR.
You with eyebrows really reminds me of yours videos from years ago, in your apartment in LA ❤️ this bitch barely ages
Please don’t forget about us on YouTube haha Sometimes I need the long content on here... not on the short content platforms
I missed you J. I want that foundation 😻 btw you look so young and fresh.
The nails 😍 I wonder if he flies his nail tech out from LA😮
You have such a healthy glow!
Jeffree. I L❤VE YOU SO MUCH!!!
Jeffree, are we gonna get some wild n' crazy (& comical) photos of you, on your ranch, with your yaks AND in the snow?  _PRETTY PLEASE?_ 🤞🍀🤞
That meat cleaver mirror is freaking awesome. I wish I had the money. I'm barely making it day by day. I'm vicariously living through Jeffree lol
I love that you always wear other brands and not just your own,  it says a lot about you 🥰  I've been watching you since the beginning and every time you upload , I'm running to see because I love ya 💞💞
It looks good but very red toned ... is that the lighting 🧐
Wait he censored the word bitch when he said stupid bitch but then he said lady gaga you’re that bitch with no censor, I’m confused
Hi Jeffrey! I love the way your hair is styled, it looks so good that way!  The product looks beautiful and natural on you! As for the wrinkle, look at it this way ok! They're just the body's way of stating "I went through some tough times but I survived and came back stronger" I'm happy to see you looking so healthy and happy! Stay positive and stay strong! Much 💖 from 🇨🇦.
This is the best you've ever looked on this channel. Keep it up ❤️
Missed you and your reviews, love!!! ❤
I rarely use YouTube anymore honestly. Except when I see see Jeffree or Shane upload.
YES!!! VIDEOS MORE THAN 5MIN FROM JS! 😭
Jeffrey,  I'm amazed of how beautiful you look,  gorgeous,  healthy and happy.  You are truly amazing we love you 💕  I'm so happy for you.  God bless you always 😘

Love the look Jeffree ❤️
It has been a minute! Missed you Jeffree! Glad you are doing good in Wyoming. And congrats on the Yak Burger being official at your favorite Steakhouse!👏
JS has never looked better than when she said goodbye to LA lifestyle...Jeffree Lynn, you look FIERCE!
I missed seeing you on YouTube! I love you IG stories and look forward to them everyday but having you do the longer form on YouTube is a must! Love ya!
Love you 😍
I do miss these reviews omg glad your doing a review for us who still live for your reviews
So happy you uploaded! Been missing your content here on youtube!
Loving this version of you Jeffree 🙏
😮 dance in the dark
Jefffreeeee did u grow ur eyebrows back yayyyyyyyeeee
The lighting in the restroom was harsh. It was giving texture palooza.
Didn't realize how much I missed these reviews! Thank you! 💜💜
Wow that was the first powder where I actually saw a difference on camera, good shit Gaga.
Yass, Ms. Thang the foundation looks stunning on you. I didn't realize how much I missed your reviews!!  I'm gonna try it myself as soon as I empty my last one. I was looking for a new one & now that you have given it the JS approval, I know it's worth the coin.
Not Jeffree stepping into the f*cking KITCHEN FOR FEEDBACK 😂😂😂😂😂
I probably wouldn't call you stupid or a bitch but some of us older fans still prefer the YouTube reviews.
Can you do the Blurring Balm Powder by Danessa Myrisk please
Love ya!! Did anyone else noticed the music in the kitchen background?🤣🤣 My people working hard!!
Can we get a car review
💜❤️‍🔥 Congratulations on all your new launches so excited for more beauts 🔥 And Hi How are Ya Baby 🥰🤗💜
Love you doing this Jeffree!   Many thanks.
Please continue to make videos on YouTube! You look super healthy and positive!

Foundation of the year!!!!!! I’m obsessed with the way it looks like my skin
Hi!@!!!!! MISS YOU
Looking forward to YOUR foundation!
Sis got tan
I have to say that when I saw the IG video I enjoyed it but also felt sad because it meant that we won't be getting a long video here on YT, but boy!!! What a beautiful surprise to see a full review!!!!. Can we make it 1 video/week or /2 weeks please 🙏.
Yesss!!! I've missed your reviews!!!! You look amazing babe!!!🥰💙
I miss these type of reviews/videos!!! :D More please!!!! :D
.... :) Are you truly happy Jeffree? You are YELLING throughout this video. Your bare skin is pink. Are you taking hormones to try to stay "peppy" and young? Or maybe you got high before this taping. So sad. I hope you'll be ok from here on out.
Yasss real JF Also, it's so clear that Christian is back...
Yes miss mama you are GLOWING 💅🏼
Really miss you Jeffree Star so happy to hear you say your back doing reviews on YouTube again.....!!!! & most importantly to me it was so sweet to see you hugging a fan who adores you & your makeup product in this Vide📹    ♿🌈📖🙏🏼Shalom🙏🏼📖🌈♿
You look really stunning and I love seeing your lines and pores
I really hope Shane's new series is with you I need to see cowboy jeffree 🥰🥰

Please try R.E.M beauty. She has a very interesting concelar concept. Black and white paint? Idk
You're gorgeous in anything ☺️
Fucking stunning x
Miss genuine reviews! Only opinion I trust, miss thing cannot be bought lol
Missed you too!
wonder how it is on a little more mature skin like early 40's to 50's? that formula looks light enough and dewy plus the added benefits have me sold!
Why are we not zoomed in for the application? 😢
Wow, he has uploaded a makeup review! I thought he had stopped making these to focus on his ranch. Glad to see you are still creating content. Welcome back!

Who else missed Jeffree's "Good morning" 😁 Happy to see you back all while enjoying your Yak journey 💕😘
love u
I love this new Jeffree full of life , hapiness and confidence
I can’t believe how much BETTER you look with your birth lips!!!    Not to sound all Sling blade on you but you have a beautiful proportionate natural mouth shape. You look 10 years younger than the last vid. Dissolving that shit gave you that refined & regal look to match your amazing eyeballs & top notch bone structure, like pls don’t ever again, K???   I have not even listen to this vid hardly bc I had to stop, pick up my jaw, & one finger type this fucking essay about your face on the IPad just now 😂 its just fascinating bc I’ve never seen or known anyone to reverse their facial work, but it worked on u, u lil rascal i hate u wicha perfect skin 7 million of dollars 😂❤❤❤❤❤ oh & glad that u did love Gaga’s stuff but love even more her reply!  🎉 cheers sweetie always a pleasure x
I love you Jeffrey you got some awesome style but your eyebrows look powdery
hes back ❤❤❤❤
When I saw the short on IG I was like...where is the wear test?! So glad you did wear test :)
Love that youre taking care of yourself and being beautifully you!
Jeffree with NATURAL LOOK IS SO STUNNING !!!!❤️✨
Sooo happy to see u been followed for long time,so happy to see u doing better and I love love your yanks. I really needed this video today man this mental health crap is killing me but I'm so happy for this video. Thanks God bless and much love ❤️ 💙💜🥰🙏
Great video, l also love yhd the foundation
Oh my GAWD I just noticed the nails. Stop it 😍
Gosh, how I wish I can get on his pr list! I'm on disability and love his makeup! Though sadly I can't afford it :( having a learning disability is sometimes hard but watching him use makeup makes me want to get into it. I just wish Makeup wasn't so much money.
Pale as fuck, junk food snackin’, LA living Jeffree was a great vibe, but honestly, tanned, Wyoming Yak rancher Jeffree with brows is the definition of a glow up! Commenting positively with good intentions on someone’s appearance can unintentionally hurt the recipient, but truly, you look so much healthier— and more importantly, happier, vibrant, and thriving. 💜
Miss you love you!! ❤
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
want to try this so bad!
so fake gaga had to come out with foundation................
Jeffree you don't even know how we miss you
You look fantastic Jeffree! So healthy and happy. Great to have you back.
You look so good! 😍
Jeffree you look so radiant, happy and healthy !! WOW!
I've missed these videos 💕
jeffrees idea of a tan is tomato red 😂
Hi jeffree ❤❤
Yassssss review time!!
fab
Wow you look good
It's wonderful to have you here again.  You look stunning as always.✌🏻❤🇨🇦
This thing makes me sick one minute he's all I'm done with this and then comes back hating on people or if his evil heart likes it good for u ..so damn  sick
Ok so the Jeffree Star Vlogs page has got to be fake because those videos are horrible!! They cut off in the middle of a sentence, repeat clips and are all over the place n has no context. This right here is a normal Jeffree video n im loving it!!!
Beautiful foundation but absolutely cannot find my shade. The pink tones go from 240 right to 320, and nothing in between so there’s no shade in between for me. 😢
Jeffree, You look better than ever !!! You look so HAPPY !!! Love you Babe.
Jeffree looking cute AF
Missed you💋
Yay Jeffree u look so happy I’m so proud of u bb
That meat clever mirror is tooo cute.
OMG I never saw this coming.  ❤
Can someone from TSA chime in about the mirror? 😂
Queen Gaga never disapoints 😍🔥
He looks so healthy and happy.
Yes! Thank you for uploading here 💜
OMG you are looking amazing. So happy to see your radiant happy face!!!
Omgosh you are stunning. Wow lady Gaga wow. Love it❤️💯

You look gorgeous and beautiful, love it ❤
You should do the new limited edition Gucci makeup
Loving this more real version of JS! You are glowing!! More than ever.
You are beautiful!
GORGEOUS as always
I missed these kind of reviews where Jeffree asks random people how good or bad the product is on him. This is how you can tell if it's worth it or not. Loved it💞
Holy sh*t he's doin makeup! I couldn't b happier! No shade but the furry cow things mayb entertaining 2 some but they aint 4 me! Give tha makeup! (Yes I know the furry cows r yacks b4 some1 gets smart!)
Makeup scares me. I envy ever who gets it right. 😭 How do you know what foundation colour to even get?
⭐⭐🌟
HE'S BACK! GIIIIIIRL ME MISSED YOU!💕
We missed you doing tutorials. You look fantastic, happy/healthy. I hope to see more in the future ❤️
I missed you Miss Star!!!!

Love the hair.
It's really been a journey for you and I'm glad you're back better than everrr!!!! Stay sweet
My fave influencer reviewing my Idol’s new launch Foundation. Huhu 😭🧡
wow! you look fabulous and now I want to try it!
HI JEFFREE!!💜  MY SCORPIO SISTER!!  🤘😎
You Look so amazing!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️ the natural Look is fucking bomb 😍
I love it and the foundation it's awesome!!
Loved this cute and simple review with a little bit of life.. im loving the new jeffree 🥰😍
Love this video!!! YouTube isn’t YouTube without a good JS review!!! You also look so happy and healthy and I love to see you living your best WY life!! Much love to you!! ❤️
OMG yay! So glad ur making yt reviews again! 😆 and that is a good shade match wow!! ❤
Lol, I'm living for this new funny positive Jefrey
I personally don't wear makeup but I'm glad to see Gagas product does exactly what it says it does and more!
Yes!!! I love this more in depth video ❤❤❤❤❤
I love watching you on tik tok BUTT ... I'd rather see the bigger reviews here on YouTube. I will say it be interesting to see mini fast reviews. Pick the shade of whatever click it forward to the next a simple slay or ew look at my skin. Faster clips with humor. It's hard not to scroll on tik tok so when videos are long long its takes alot of dedication to see what's what.
I think I might have to try this one. It looks really beautiful on you!!
Glad to you back again miss all your videos awesome 👏🏻
Jeffree waving that knife around. 😳
YASS WE MISS YOU!!! COME BACK TO DO VLOGS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
we missed you
I think you look amazing nowadays Jeffree! The new look is a keeper! 😃✌️
Can someone please send me a couple dollars cash app for food an transportation 🙏🧡  I'm struggling
Glad your back but also understand you needing time for yourself just to live off and away from social media!
So happy I’ve missed you!!!!!
MISSED YOU DARLIN!!! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 🥂
I dig the JS realness.
You look very happy and healthy!
Yes! I don’t TikTok so I’m happy you came back here!! 🎉❤
So many people are saying the Believe Beauty from Dollar General is a full on dupe. At $5.50, I mean you're not get the skin care aspect, but if you already use good skin care, then you only care about looking snatched.
Hi jeffrey you look so fresh and stress free ,,,   best of luck ✨️
missed these sooooooo much!!!
I clicked soooo fast!
I MISSSSSS YOUUUUUUUUU
You look amazing ❤❤
I’m shook at how good this looks 🥵😍

Love your review gorgeous products x
New Jeffree seems more full of life than ever. ❤
Thank you for bringing this to YouTube! As someone whose 30 I don’t have tik tok and don’t plan on getting it and it bums me out that other creators just abandoned us here!! Lol
Does anyone else miss the giveaways? 😅
Okayyy pause! Only watched like 0:10 seconds, but I gotta say damn! You are glowing with happiness and looks beautiful allways <3 Oh yeah, gotta watch the rest!

I really love when you make reviews,  kisses 😘😘
Wow Ive never seen you so tanned! Must be the outdoor activities in Wyoming 👽  edit and voilA, you ansvered this minute later in the video. 😄 looking healthy! just didnt expect to see the day you dissolve all lip filler. I think looks great with or without. You one of the rare people it actually looks good on.
You look so happy Jeffree 😊 Love the mirror😍 You look great!
Hello 😊
I love you JS!!! We missed you here ❤️❤️❤️🫶🏾🫶🏾
So exciteddddd glad ur back doing reviews🖤
I love you b*tch. Your new look is amazing I’m so glad you are focusing on your health. This world would be too vanilla with out you in it 😘
Can you do a full review of the Zara foundation.?
Love that lady gaga commented! Let's see if she adds u to the pr list! 🤔 she should!
So happy to see a new review !!! Love you so much !!!!❤
purrr
I was waiting for you to review this on YouTube! Thank you so much
Omg u mean some id*ots out there really asked if the mirror was legal!? 🤦‍♀️ wow. Duh!!!!
Please... ans me
We missed you JS❤️❤️❤️
of course u r not getting any pr from her
Omg Jeffree you're looking amazing!!!  We live for the natural look!!! The scruff, eyebrows and natural lips is everything!!!!!
Be careful bc this foundation is full of silicon that’s why it looks so beautiful on the skin but if you wear it every day, it will break you out
Please... please.. i know that is possible for you...
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
Jeffrey has amazing looking eyes on this video. I mean, without the makeup first.
I love the mirror from the beginning  💗💗💗
I’ve been waiting for this review !

My replacement item was shipped out within 2 days. #shook thank yall for being amazing!
