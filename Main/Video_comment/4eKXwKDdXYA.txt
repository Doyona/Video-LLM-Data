Have a notable day  (Pls subscribe)
3:27 The Nether: Am I a joke to you?
Luke should do a 200 days superflat because the superflat is unlike any other spinoff he has done... superflat is a regular world and is thrivable and not like the nether or the end spinoffs he did before... come on luke LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE!!!!!!
10:37 "...eye of enders..." I feel like it should be "eyes of ender" like jumping rope instead of rope jumping  edit: he later said "sheeps" so i guess I shouldn't be mad
Not a true superflat ask mogswamp
come on man, it has been 4 years, we need part 2
19:21 67 hahahah
The nether on a super flat world was flat. But that was on the WiiU
There is buildings
John 3:16 For God So Loved The World He Gave His Only Begotten Son Who ever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life
I can hear the difference between modern Luke and old Luke. His power and knowledge has grown far beyond his start. And he only grows stronger...
we need a new download link
i mean... This needs a 200!
16:18 lol my fav part
Luke, on day twenty, you got a bit too confident
1:44 Just like Dad!
1:23 “im scawred”
he has called netherack netherwart and netherwart netherack really luke
So flat… SO NOTABLE
Still waiting for 200 days😢
You can go to the end on old PS3/Xbox 360/ one edition Minecraft
i finally realized i like this bc hes become somthing great from somthing we all can do its inprisng in a way hes test and worked on everything in this game with the pure and insane thought of survial no matter wut its truly a intersting play style and i hope i can watch them all
it's been four years and yet he didn't returned to this world...
It feels weird hearing LTN swear 5:50
Very flat and very notable
5:53 yeah u sure you meant witches…
lokey bedrock super flate with just the starter chest
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
25:53 Luke turns into JonTron
Fun fact: in the old console versions the Nether was actually flat in a Superflat world!
5:50 me and Luke have alot in common in what we call witches
whenever i play hardcore in superflat my first course of action is get wood, some cobblestone from a village, get dirt, and then make a spiral staircase and live high up away from the slimes. everything else is pretty much the same tho, my walls are just the existence of a long fall
I miss when his videos were shorter and had a voiceover instead of the mf talking during the game
4:20 I'm sorry, but I have multiple clips saying it is about vanity
i like redstone too much i could never play with sound on lol
Try bedrock edition
25:00
Does nobody know that the nether used to be flat in flat worlds
And imagine doing this in pocket edition, no villages at all and those dang slimes are menaces to society they don't care if you're in your chest or looking away somewhere else they will throw hands either way, and also to even be able to progress at all you may need to cheat in one of the chests that minecraft could give to you, it's basically just a toggle that says do you want a chest when you spawn in, pocket edition sucks.
I am a Big fan
I don't think I can do a alright joke in this comment section
100 days in minecraft 404 challenge
Luke the notable plz fight the giant slime boss also I subscribed
So how IS Elytra pronounced??
So sad they patched the curing trade pricing 😢
U can make ender chest with the eyes of ender
Do 100 Days minecraft Super Flat…. BUT ON BEDROCK EDITION!!!!
9:23 I think I remember vaguely that in the old PS4 Version of Minecraft, if you booted up/created a Superflat world, and go to the nether; it would be extremely flat as well.   Might just be me tho, love the videos!
2:43  uhhhh whales 🐳
What you could have done is mined gold in the Nether, and bartered with the Piglins for water bottles. That way, you could have gotten yourself some potions.
Now... do it in bedrock
there should be a 200+ days of superflat
right now im at 285 days in superflat, i have full netherite, a trading hall, i have a netherite axe, (still running diamond tool, im working on it) i have a double mob farm and i have a 1/2 scale of the infdev brick pyramid video (update, all my worlds got corrupted 😭)
A good comment section
I didnt even know it wasnt pronounced different 11:34
Why are these comments so fresh
I've been slowly making my way through these 100 days videos and every time he spaces the water buckets 4 blocks apart instead of 8 i get so fucking mad what tf is wrong with me 😂
Be a real man and go on bedrock
6:07 diamond armour FULL SET
Wait if  Elytra ain't pronounced E LIE TRUH how is it pronounced
I'm quite literally the newest comment
six diamonds sixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx how i get only one and that     one in  every 5 vilages
day 6 of asking for an ocean-only 100 days challenge 💔
Raise your hand if you were afraid to go to the comments cause of how many times he said massive
Am i late?
Love these videos luke 😂
Rip super flat horse
Seriously. The slime sound will drIVE YOU INSANE
Damn, mogswamp has some competition....
200 sun cycles of thy superflat terrarium please and thank you Lucius of Thy Notworthy!
Please do 200 days
Crazy this is still so relevant 4 years later. People are asking for 200 days
We want 200 days super flat
200 hundey days!!!
POV: No mans land…
100 days - [Minecraft Illinois]
Really superflat 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Firm clutches of poverty is great 😂
Never ask a woman her age Never ask a man his salary Never ask Luke what happened on day 28
Can use which to cure zombies with I think 12.5% chance to throw a weakness potion
you dont have rights is crazy
1:30 what is that sheep doing in the house
I miss structures on flat qwq
100 days ice biome?
if you play on the Legacy Console version of Minecraft, the Nether becomes superflat too
Luke should continue superflat since now theres the stronghold in superflat. And trial chambers
no golems were harmed during the events of this video, is not what luke would ever say
The elytra is pronounced like that
“An apple a day keeps the slimes away oh wait nothing keep the slimes away” that is my favorite joke so far ever
I swear I thought the nether used to be flat on a flat world
nether wart grows faster in the dark so putting it out side like that holds you back.
wait it’s not pronounced el-eye-tra?
They added the stronghold to super flat so I hope he comes back to this again
That’s nether wart 10:00
100 days minecraft education
I’m surviving 100 days flat world hard core right now 3:33pm lol
I LOVE LUKES HOUSE. THE EMERALD BLOCKS LOOKS LIKE SLIME UPGRADED❤😊❤😊
22:45 you know what else is massive
3:40 you know what else is massive
Normally for these spinoffs I like just the first hundred days, but everything after feels repetitive (like 200 and 300 days) but I'm really interested to see what Luke can manage to create in a superflat world with double the time he had in this video. I'd be interested to see the farms he makes, the things he builds and what his approach to new challenges (like the ender dragon) would be. Luke, if you see this, please continue this series with another video!
You can customize Superflat worlds to have different layers & even quantity of layers.
wait... it's not pronounced "ee-lie-trah" ???  HOW IS IT PRONOUNCED??
If you were to play on the xbox 360 or ps3 on minecraft the nether is indeed flat
Alternative title: Lets Play: Slime Rancher
PLZZZZZ 200 days
“This is hardcore super flat, not about vanity.” WOW that statement aged poorly.
5:49 I never thought he would say that
25:02 "No, guys, I didn't go into creative mode!"
I will only subscribe if you say soobscarb instead of saying subscribe
3:10
5:52 uh huh suuure luke
How about you do a complete flat 100 days
That "farm" is so inefficient. Why do water 4 plots water? When you could do water 8 plots water? Water wets 4 plots in every direction hence the old farm plot being a water source in the center and 4 plots out in every direction. So if you do strips instead which based of a lot of these vids he does. then itd be better to do water 8 plots water. Youd get more crops that way like a lot more. Still love the vids. Great to watch when I can't play MC myself.
13:25 POV: me talking about my first relationship
Aw man, Blue Orchids are my Favorite Flower too! Based!
9:29 nether is actualy superflat in superflat world but only in console legacy
this is soo cool
I can survive without the structures
So no one is gonna say that he said "killing bitches on my land" ?
The MediaFire link no longer works :(
Moree❤❤
Dah I shat myself again
Thank god for ze map 6:53 it must of helped quite a bit strange how you start going straight then go wildly off course
He knows where ze villages are
Day 200 on Superflat??
i know you wanna try this challenge but your on bedrock so heres what ur gonna do to start urself off:   put on hard mode NOT hardcore as you CANT get bonus chests in hardcore as an option, the reason you HAVE to use bonus chests is because bedrock doesnt have villages on there superflats anymore (sucks to be us i know but we can work around this, plus it makes the challenge harder and more interesting if your into that sorta thing!) when you make the world, if your bonus chest doesnt have OAK TREES or atleast 2 APPLES, make a new one, otherwise you wont be able to get villagers and ALOT of new items, and every man made item in superflat is very scarce, once you made a house your gonna wanna wait for zombies to drop enough iron for a cauldron and a bucket, once you have that you can farm, fish (poorly) make a zombie farm that turns them into drowns (once you have this you can obtain copper which is then used to make a lightning rod) make a massive pig farm with your house, put the liughtning rod in the middle, once the lightning strikes and there zombie piglins, kill them for gold items and gold nuggets, then use that gold to make a golden apple, once you have a trapped zombie villager,try to get a witch to throw potion of weakness at you AND the villager at the same time, give bro that golden apple, kill the witch, protect bro turn him into  lecturn guy as there isnt a way to get flint here so youll have to ell this guy wool, but because you have a waterbucket now a sheep farm shouldnt be hard to make either, at that point your kind of set, remeber the 2 APPLES? use the extra one on another villager, make villagers frick, have village of ur own, i dont know if this will spawn raiders with totems and emeralds as loot but if it does good luck, thats all i know for know, if someone out there is reading this and it helped, my job here i done, leave me a like if this helped!! :D
Wait he made a reference to his og 100 days saying “I made a sword and a pickaxe I think most of us probably would“
you should do the version thing that gives you every spawnable structure
doing this on bedrock is much worse, trust me those slimes suck with wooden swords
27:15 why does he sound exactly like Ben Schwartz
25:54 - "Can you hear this? [...] It´s just so nice to hear nothing but SILENCE!!"
11:33 that is how you say it
bro pleas do 200 days or 1000 and buld a slime totrturing factory
Tried that once, it‘s impossible to even get cobblestone that‘s one thing java definitely does better
Any chance on 200 days? 🥲
If you go far enough in superflat worlds the terrain changes to normal world gen. At least it used to be this way in older versions.
200 days?
Embrace capitalism
Sadly bedrock has none of this, no villages just slimes and peaceful mobs
5:49 "today was a good one, it started by killing bitches on my front lawn"
3:06  ah yes an ethnical business man
How did the village appear in the flat world?
(TLDR Luke could've found the end portal)  Little does @LukeTheNotable know, had he done a little bit of exploring he could've found one of the strongholds in the world.  They are floating in the air and the only complete room is the portal room.  All the hallways are missing but you can find floating chests, staircases, loads of iron bars; sometimes you even find floating doors.
w
Great vidio luchas
he makes houses like its me as an 8 year old
mogswamp is gonna be impressed
i miss this vid
Why are all these comments so fresh?? This video is so old
8:16 Yes, completely natural spawning diamonds
LTN superflat with Mogswamp needs to happen
200 days when ?
10:51 there is a way to get to the end, unfortunately you're on the wrong Superflat, the one that has it is the Desert one
11:35 wait so how IS it pronounced?
When you want to play superflat but slimes
Luke TheNotable: 100 days in Minecraft superflat.  Mogswamp: 10 years in superflat
U
Never knew luke would swear😮
!
You could have talked to Mogswamp for good insights
He said the b word in stead of witch
luke the person you can note, dis is a very gud vid
People waiting for mogswamp (not begging) 👇
People waiting for mogswamp (not begging) 👇
10:01 you can trade with Piggins to get water bottles and then empty them to get glass
Villages don't spawn in bedrock superflat 🥲
PLEASE CONTINUE THIS SERIES!!!
We need more days this was so good
11:34 ELYTRA ISN'T PRONOUNCED LIKE THAT?!?!?!?!????
People before 300 BCE
waiting for ltn to follow up on one of his spinoff 100 days series (never gonna happen unless its with his wife)
Please do more days
1000 would be notable
Definitely should have built a circular house like a giant meatball to protest the flatness of the world
But you are saying elytra right so you're not making anyone mad
In xbox360 the nether is flat
Oh you said a bad  word
3:09 me going to a sleep over when the host is some guy named timmy:
You might come across slimecicle
3 years woah
3y?  😃💀☠️
it is pronounced elytry NOT eeleetra
If u wanna go to the end, make the world in 1.17 and then update it
Lil bro needs to do hardcore bedrock superflat and If you want that to happen click this button 👇
26:00  Your horse is eating the carpet 😂.
100 days in Minecraft Flat World (Bedrock)
great, now beat super-flat on hardcore at 1/2 a heart (half)
He
you did pronounce elytra correctly
I actually had a superflat world and it was very fun! Thank you for showing me that survival superflat can be not only done but fun. Sadly my superflat safe and every other world i had got lost after my laptop crashed. RIP my superflat world 2021-2022
Kick the ovaries is crazy😂😂😂😂😂
I really need a second part of this.
Fun fact you can now find the sronghold in the new update
More
If your in bedrock you don’t get anything
5:50 killing whiches on my land
In console super flats strongholds do spawn
who is going to tell him the withers name is simins
200 days superflat please
i just had a thought. What if he used the lave from the blacksmith to make an infinity cobble source
Definitely more doable in legacy console due to its more customizable super flat options
Luke theprofitable
Ohhh yay some netarac can brew potions with it
plz 1000 days
This is... this is the tamest LTN video I've ever seen.  What happened to bro? Thank god it did. 😂
strongholds used to spawn above ground on super flats a long time ago, shame they removed it.
Pre-Nether Update, Superflat worlds had Flat Nethers, but a Normal End Dimension
In some of the older versions of minecraft there was a super flat nether.
basically, copper is the rarest ore in superflat
uuurrrmmmm actually chests can hold coal (nerd)
Nether used to be superflat on the Xbox
A part 2 would be pretty notable
I remember when this was a month ago
On the Xbox 360 version the nether could be superflat
Hey luke... why haven't you gone to the artic... luke the notable scarred of alil snow 😉
26:05 "And it's just so nice to hear nothing but SILENCE. 🗣🔥🔥🔥‼"
I pronounce it E-lie-tra
Do 1000 days please
Mogswamp would be proud. 🥲
5:51 BAD WORD
Luke... I don’t know how to tell you, but that IS how you pronounce Elytra 😂.
This is just what living in Ohio is like.
Yeet
I love this man and his ability to entertain but contentwise is really repetitive than in most challenges like this one it becomes a race to abuse villagers and then the gameplay is very similar
can you do a flat world not a  super flat
"!Get out of bed, Timmy, or I'll kill your parents!" It's so cruel I can't stop laughing! 😆
Please Continue
Hmmmm this vid was 3 yrs ago but all the comm3nts are surprisingly recent
i know something else that doesnt have rights, Creepers, little goblins always blowing me, UP BLOWING ME UP
E
Please do a 200 days I play on a superflat world survival very often and I enjoy it I really liked your video and would like to see where your world would go I am exclusive to bedrock and so don't have access to villages or anything like that but I gave myself some potions and apples to cure them so that I can have villagers as well and I have fun on the super flat survival I think it's a very fun way to play Minecraft and I think you should do more videos on this super flat survival series and maybe even do it on Pocket edition if you want to because I'm completely bound to only Minecraft on my phone or the console have an Xbox my Xbox 360 is sadly broken but I have a newer Xbox that my girlfriend is letting me use and I can play Minecraft on that but I don't often because I am established on my phone so most of the time I play on my phone Pocket edition but I'm playing exclusively bedrock Minecraft and I've never really been able to play Java Minecraft I've never had access to it and so I would really like you to to do more series on the bedrock edition of Minecraft would be very entertaining
20:46 what about the nether?
Continue this world!
Who here in 1999
Still waiting for 200 hundred days of superflat
Wait, it's not pronounced "el-i-trah"?
DID YOU JUST SAY BITCHE-
Part 2 plis
“I made a sword and a pickaxe; I think most of us probably would.” -Luke TheNotable
Please do a pt 2
DO IT
That cap 🧢.
bro said very bad word
I'd be really keen to see more of this series, I've just started a hardcore super flat world myself. Making it in 1.19 or later seems to generate a stronghold too! Not sure if updating a world would achieve that, but getting elytra is now possible in supeflat, along with four different trims
The old console edition had a flat neater
Masterpiece
You're so cool like I asked right next to me All of your videos
The slimes only spawn in pre designated chunks. Thats why they dont appear behind certain walls but do behind others
29:12 yeah of course it did
we need 200 days
Please make a part 2!
The superflat nether thing reminds me. The old PS3 edition of the game *did* have a superflat nether. It.. was very underwhelming, but at least it was a good testing ground.
Sleeping so I can get a good education for a good future: 🚫 100 days LTN: ✅
23 Million views should be enough for 200 days? I know you are balls deep in new and exiting game modes or interesting twist on the series but I at least would be down for 200 days and this series on going success
Idk why but Youtube REALLY wanted me to rewatch this for some reason
Psst... if you play it in any version past 1.18.2 you'll be able to go to the end...
thought mogswamp would comment
Plz continue this 100 days 200 days in super flat would be amazing to see
200 days super flat?
19:06  "I dont have hoes but whatever" - LTN
i have started my one hardcore superflat world so fun
No netherite armor no dragons. Head poor like my  villagers
actually, the superflat mode is the one that cannot generate any structure, your world is only a flat world 🤓👆
Bro, I could’ve swore you did 200 days😭😞 please do it🙏🏼
Hello, does anyone know how I can download the world? The page won't let me download it ;(
My relationship be lile
I just want a sequel to this
I dare you to play minecraft super flat but in bedrock edition Good luck Luke
Man this is three years old? I am starting to feel old.
3:27 gravel in the Nether: am I a joke to you?
Wait… it’s NOT pronounced “e-lie-tra”?! 😂
Ee-ligh-tra is the correct pronunciation for elytra though
I hope to see the next super flat adventure soon
You should try the bedrock version,it’s much harder since no structures spawn so no villagers what only means the bonus chest is your only source of wood in the form of saplings and you can only get iron from zombie drops.
Mog swamp?
There actually used to be a super flat nether prior to the nether update
I tried this and failed 5 times
"If you'd like me to continue this series hit the like button leave a comment... subscribe.." Luke please do part two its got 777K as of writin this and its been 3 years
Please make 200 days
I have a version of Minecraft that actually has a superflat nether
777k likes nice
"Its not flat"  It used to be  On bed rock  Wayyyyy back when  On super flat wprlds. You would have super flat nether
bro i call elytra elEYEtra too i didn't find out until today that elytra is actually pronouced elEtra
Hey Luke can you do a 100 days all villages? There is this way to generate millions of villages in Java
The weirdest thing about super flat worlds is that the nether used to be flat in super flat worlds but now they’re not, can anyone explain why? My biggest guess was because of the nether and caves and cliffs updates changing world generation but idk.
Whos here in 2024
In the console edition the neather used to get effected by superflat
nah that is actually how you say "elytra"
Bedrock player weep knowingly that they may not try this themselves
Btw there is a way to get to the end on superflat but you first have to start the world in a certain version in order to generate the strongholdand, then upgrade the world to your desired version. Mogswamps superflat tutorial explains it nicely.
Thank you to LTN for going all the way to Mongolia this video.
200 days please 🙏
terraria
Mogswamp proved you wrong even without structures it's possible to survive
YESS DO 200 DAYS
Bro is role-playing as a Mongolian. 😂
200 hundred days superflat 🤩
The neather used to be flat on the 360 version
8:36, the nether is flat in the xbox 360 version of minecraft
200 days
777k🎉 likes
9:58 Honestly Scared Me😭 (I Miss Minecraft Videos Like This)
Damnit mojang why can't you put superflat on Nintendo switch Minecraft or Xbox Minecraft they only have regular flat mode
I just started watching hazbin hotel it’s literally so good, but you are still better than it
Do it on mobile
bruh
i love you
So many slimes...
"netherack"
2:25 ... Its out of context...
No way! 100 days in Kansas?!?
Next we need bedrock edition super flat    For anyone who doesn’t know there are no villages on bedrock edition.
"after selling some sticks to this idiot"
I’m quite a shy fellow
Hello
Hi
200 days super flat ?
With 2 gravel and 2 dirt you can make 4 coarse dirt, you can use a hoe on coarse dirt to make it until normal dirt, giving you an extra 2 dirt and a way to duplicate your dirt, meaning theoretically you could do full scale terraforming and turn a flat world into a not so flat world
100 days bedrock superflat I know It’s pretty much impossible because no structures can spawn whatsoever no villages no trees nothing but still could be fun
Please make 200 days
More make 200 days please
dude slimes can spawn on path blocks either
I sweat if 200 days don't come, I'll come to your house with a shotgun mr.notebale
write a comment, show a little support
Yes the hell he did say b****
Never warts what a rookie 😂
So where is the 200 days video? It's been 2 years Mr. Notable.
i know it an old video but try clicking f3 and g or b for hitboxs so u dont hit villagers
Ay
The world download doesn’t work please fix it I collect these worlds now
Luke forgetting that the entire nether is lava is unironically hilarious to me
Subscribe like your mom
Imagine if Mogswamp commented lol
That one kid be like
I don’t know why but his videos are some of the very few where I can watch over and over and never get old
11:39 undertale players be like
You should've done this challenge with no villages or structures that you can loot Structures are basically cheating
Wait it’s not pronounced elytra
Luke, you can put Iron Armor in a furnace and smelt it down to make iron Nuggets. If you have Nine Iron Nuggets you can make Iron Ingots. That's the method I use on my Hardcore Superflat World for a lot of Iron.
“ sorry slimes you can’t have my crops you don’t have rights” - lukethenotable
Yeah, you said witches, sure
i have done this
Sword and pick axe I think we all would a truly notable line
wait how else do you pronounce elytra
This video would be so differwnt if he was on the 2022 april fools update.If he waited the year he wouldve fought the dragon from the nether fortress chests
When are we getting 200 days superflat?
Is nobody gonna talk about Luke saying, clapped and your mom?..
In super flat world you need capitalism.
pls more super flat __________________________
Happy New Year of 2024, everybody 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
Finally super flat
Did he said b******
What's awesome to me is that you can customize the flat world but Luke decided to do the noteable thing and use the basic default superflat.   Noice.
Do flat with tors pls
Why isn't there a monument? You even said at some point, "It's not a Luke TheNotable 100 days without a monument". AFK was the exeption because you can't do anything while AFK.
one pro from the slimes is you get a lot of experience points from them
Mogswamp 11 years
Believe in Jesus and repent
Why all newest comments come from 8 year olds?
bro said killing b**ches
Reply "when" if this was your first 100 days.
Is anyone gonna talk about the fact that the wandering traders just didn’t exist
If he was playing on a version before village and pillage, I think you could get flint since villages primarily used gravel for walkways
BAD GOLEMS!!!! YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTACK PLAYERS!!!!!!!
Why did he strip the logs?
I think you should continue the series
dude i slept through 100 days hardcore playlist all the way to the end of this video
why does he have an enchanted compass?
Luke, you seriously underestimate how much Superflat Survival is about vanity.
Took him a few hundred days to make his compound superflat in 4000 days xD
WAIT ITS NOT PRONOUNCED UH-LYE-TRA????
For the people who say he cheated with the six diamonds in the chest it has a chance of 0.3 per village.
Is came out two years ago I feel old now
The way he pronounced elytra is the correct way, any other way is wrong
hey luke you have inspired me and i am even playing flat world to beat the game RIGHT NOW!! thanks for they idea
hey luke you have inspired me and i am even playing flat world to beat the game RIGHT NOW!! thanks for they idea
"corrupted"
Next time play with structures turned off, villages make these too easy.
I am subd to you!
Bruh you should have mase a shield very early
2:59 HE SAID THE THING 😮
He has no fears HE HAS AN ALEX SKIN
5:48 I love how he said b*tches instead of witches
i would like a 200 days of this
you should do 200 days on super flat it would be super super COOL!!!
mogswamp would be shocked on how little progress you made
Its superflat, like your mom
Where superflat 200 Days? u could try and get every block accessible to u. and make it a glorious room.
you can downgrade the superflat world into a version that doesn't have super flat and then go to the end portal blow it up, and then you will have the end portal frames, update back to the version you where on build the end portal, beat the game
All i hear is PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP
you should do 100 real life days in minecraft
Please do 200 days in Super flat!!!!!
Oh you don't know my pain. Try  it with no structures
3:10 mmmmmmm, S L A V E R Y
Can you please do 2 hundo?
I can't I play bedrock and structures don't spawn in bedrock superflat.
"i have a diamond shovel" proceeds to use the entire thing. Love the vids man!
i love watching newbies playing minecraft, especially if theyre funny like this guy. but dont worry, when i started playing minecraft more than 10 years ago i was actually worse than this, especially since i didnt use the internet to help myself get better, i just had to slowly "Get good"
Fun Fact: deadmau5 suggested Superflat worlds*  *Fun Facts are not guaranteed to be accurate please dont hurt me
Xbox 360 super flat worlds in the nether it was superflat too but now it isnt
It is much harder to do it in Bedrock, there are no structures, your only hope is a bonus chest
Mogswamp:impossible
Wait.. how is Elytra pronounced?! I've always pronounced it El-ly-tra. 😓
"god damn it timmy ill kill your parents"💀
Why not just take lava from the Nether. There's lava everywhere.
You can actually find strongholds now in Superflat, but they spawn in the air. Came across it myself
Pleases continuously this sires
has anyone menschen that there is a setting in sound called hostile mobs. it allows for no hostile mob sounds
whens 200 days
i would just like to say if you ever try this again you can turn off the sound of the slimes so you dont lose your mind again
Pretty obvious rigged chests 💀
He actually said elytra correctly
Try an older version (pre 1.14). That's much harder, because only the blacksmith has chest.
26:01. The horse likes eating carpet
Wait how are you supposed to pronounce elytra?
We need 200 days, than 300, than 1000, than 2000, than 3000, than A MILLION
WHY DO U WANNA FIGHT ME PLEASE IM A FAN
I know you need a video and all, but if the only objective is to not die, then just make a dirt box and afk for 100 days
COME ON PART 222222
Luke:you can’t get flint Piglins:am I a joke to you?
Eye Carumba, this was nearly THREE years ago?
I suck nuts
Ain’t no one watching this anymore
He forgot that he can get a lucky drop from bartering with piglins and get water bottles for the splash weakness potion
Why are so many people watching this all of a sudden?
10:01 netherrack?
Ik this is 2 years old but it would be nice to see 200 days
Well I officially know I'm old when the weaponsmith I just called the blacksmith because that's all it ever has been for me. What the hell is a blacksmith now?
T A T E R S
Fun fact. In the legacy console edition if you enter the nerver the nether would be flat
200 days?!!
You can only get 1-3 diamonds in a village chesy
i need more
I think the only way to make end portal is creative mode
Yes YOU
Jesus loves you
200?
Blud openly admitted to wanting to final solution the slimes💀💀🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Idk
Bonemeal the grass to get flowers then put the flowers next to a tree and let it grow, after that there is a chance to get a bee hive for honey and that is sugar.
14:23
make a minecraft server
Part 2!
I'm sick rn, this made my day and made me feel a bit better
The way that he breaks the leaves with the axe 💀 13:58
You taught me how to make a good farm in minecraft
u pronounced it right' 11:35
Back in the Xbox one edition of Minecraft. The nether was actually a super flat in a super flat world.
Pls continue this
I need more... please... 200days... superflat
5:49 LOL
There was a point in time where superflat had a flat nether it was so fun, not to mention it was when the worlds had like an 1000x1000 limit so in the nether there was just walls of bedrock around you where the world ended
You Java people raid villages like monsters us bedrockers work for stuff without the villagers.
I had 0 hope for this... glad he was able to prove me wrong 😂
In the old legacy console versions of Minecraft the nether was also flat and had pretty much nothing worth using
Nice
this down load link isn't valid
omg this is so cool
i can only say one thing old minecraft superflat was worse...... (the nether is also flat)

If you needed more water do the infinite water glitch

No slimes, you can't have any, you don't have rights  Relateable
Yo pls do a 200 days super flat my cat got flattened 😭

Yeah
Lol
14:22 an add played literally when you said sheep, so it sounded like: “i have a great idea! And it involves shi-
dam.......... cant believe this was 2 years ago! time has flown by sooooooooooooo fast...
Don’t kill the cats!
The slimepound
Reply for a tater
wait... how do you pronounce elytra?
you can play superflat with the nether flat buts its on xbox 360
Mogswamp:Pathetic
I was out  and i saw a 4 year old watching you
I think one way of limiting the slime spawns is to NOT kill them, whack the big ones till you have lots ot tiny ones and i think it ups the entity count. Do that enough and nothing else is going to spawn
F those slimes. Played superflat a few times and they are a nightmare
Super flat in bedrock is even harder
he should do this again now that strongholds generate on superflat
8:16 sus
superflat nether exists in the old legacy version of the game
12:52
Just a 1+ comment
23:20 roof
On some versions you can spawn structures before you load into the world so technically you could be the game on a superflat
1:56 I am a very big nerd and the reason (probably) slimes didn’t spawn in the wall is because for them to spawn, you must be 25+ blocks away from that chunk
Mudflaps did it without a village or any structures
-forgets he has nether blocks-
Nice vid
you should do a colab with mogswamp
mogswamp has a new competitor
Strong holes spawn super far in superflat
25:45
i killed some bitches on my land wait witches i meant witches
Please do another superflat😢😢
do 200 days super flat
UwU
200 days pls
Do 100 days only in a village
New Title: Luke the Notable whines about slimes for 30 minutes!
I had a laptop with Minecraft the nether was flat there
I have an Xbox 360 and it has Minecraft and when I play on superflat, strongholds spawn and when it spawns on superflat it spawns in air. Also you could customize the ground in there, I made a TNT world.
I watched this video and now I here slimes when I sleep
Shovels bro... Enough pathway blocks and the slimes Won't spawn.
a comment
200 days please
the gameplay is different on bedrock
I’m confused how are you supposed to pronounce elytra
superflat bedrock 100 days?
capitalism
in the older minecraft the paths in the villages were gravel
Omgg1!1!1!1!1 he said cruse
Should have played on 1.18.2, strongholds can generate in superflat(I think, I googled it, dont quote me)
Old nether used to be flag if you hoped int9 the nether on a super flag world
He should upgrade this world to 1.18.2 so he can actually reach the end at some point
“It’s solid and sturdy unlike you’re grandma,” 😂
5:56 lol
19:08 i feel ya bro
he  goes the whole mile, to pit in perspective: this entire video is would only get you through 2 Minecraft days
In the older version the nether was flat and REALLY hard
WE MUST CONTINUE THIS!
Ok
wiches? more like biches
omg i just checked the  comments and almost every comment is in the past week lol it seems im not the only new viewer here
Mogswamp would be proud 🫡
killin bitches?
Wait it's not pronounced elytra
Said a bad word at the end of 11 to 20
The only word in this video is "slime"
Pls do 200 days
He called the nether wart netherack at 9:59
Still waiting for 200 days
200
Please do more
One word. Paths.
Doe 200 deys
I remember on old bedrock the nether used to be flat.
u are not notable ha ha ha
Bro makes the impossible possible
Hi more to see
More
i would love to see more days of this :) it’s super cool.
no, you say elytra correctly entomology agrees with your pronunciation
22:49 Yeah my grandma not that sturdy that’s why she’s inside a vase
lol
Petition for 200 days of Superflat
he actually went through day 69 without making it a big deal. Is this even the same Luke?
now do structureless
The nether used to be flat on older consoles
Hey, I actually did that one! Well, not in hardcore😅. It was actually quite fun. The only downside is that i now carry a deep, boundless hatred against slimes, and from the first few minutes of the video, it looks like you are on the same path.
Ah so thats why you don't have any bitches, because you kill them
this man is the definition of capitalism
Make more
I know im late by like 30 mins, but the flatworld nether is only available on Ps3/XBOX360
UwU
A
Are you able to keep it family friendly pllllllsssss
“I know it’s not pronounced elytra” Me: “YES IT IS!”
2:14 “charcoal is the only way to get torches here” The villages, which have torches on the lampposts: “am I a joke to you?”
I love your superflat challenge, I was also wondering about the harder version, if you want to. A Flatland with no structures, just a bonus chest? LIke the Bedrock version.
Part 2
Bro why are u cussin it’s inappropriate and vilont
Hi
day 6 of asking for 100 days village
Super flat like your mom-
To prevent slime spawns you could have used your shovel to make grass into path blocks so that it would be cheaper and quicker. . .
0:15 Missed the opportunity to make a FLATline joke.
Luke sounds like Eren at the beginning
Fun fact: The Nether used to be flat on superflat worlds. At least it did at some point in bedrock minecraft. I have a really old un-updated version of minecraft on my Xbox 360 (thats how you know its OLD loll) where I can still go to the flat Nether and its very eerie.
Please do 200 days
I remember when many structures would spawn in Superflat. I’m talking floating mineshafts and even strongholds.
9:27 the xbox 360 edition's is flat. get nerded nerd.
Please make a sequel to this!
i love th fact that you put "This video is intended for audiences 13+ years old for the following reasons Fantasy Violence Violent References Suggestive Themes Crude Humor" when you know no ones gonna listen to it lol
his fov hurts everytime
4:20 what ya say
make  a part two
5:50 cracked me up🤣
3:53
Good😂
you know that he hates the slimes so much just by his reaction of not hearing them for the first time 26:06
Day 20 thank to these idiots you got some goodies and survived 100 days "idiots save live"
I love this I love your videos they are awesome idc if I'm not 13 or older I get the jokes and stuff I'm 10 bout to be 11 iv'e been watch in you since 100 days of hardcore Minecraft.
200 days!!!!
Support
Luke if you create a superflat world in 1.17 or earlier and upgrade to 1.18.2 or later you'll get structures like strongholds pillager outposts ruined portals and mineshafts and you'll be able to build 64 layers below the bedrock
O
please call lapis blue pickles
why was threr blood on the stone?
Well, Alex is flat indeed
I let my 9 year old cousin watch this cuz minecraft is a kids game and...... 5:51. I feel terrible now
I started a superflat survival world and i managed to find an end ruin floating in the sky. The lava in the portal room allowed me to make a nether portal and soon i hope to beat the game. Its not hardcore, but its still an interesting challenge.  Edit: visited that world again cause of the video. I did beat the dragon.
He got 6 diamonds in one chest? 😵‍💫
I think this is the first time I ever heard Luke swear. It scares me😢
wheres 200 days superflat :(
Wow! Didn’t know your sister was a minecraft mode
5:50
It is a elytra
Me here still waiting, praying, staying to see a 200 days superflat. When will my waiting end...
Spam 27:00 it sounds sus
26:50 simp alert
6:02
Do another episode
27:42 I didn't even do anything :(
back in version 1.4 I think had a flat nether, idk it was before stairs could connect to eachother or flip upsidedown
Ok
Well the nether was flat in superflat worlds back in the 360 days
You could have just put water to have the slimes can't spau
20:24 notice the zombie piglin riding the strider
26:06 nothing but SILENCE
I am doing 100 days super flat on my phone HARD mode die=me deleting world. My phone doesn't have structure generation so Even HARDER. Butt 🍑 I'm using bonus chest.
Please do 200 days superflat
200 days
There better be a 200 days on the way
10:01 "hey hey! Some *netherrack*"
Do 100 days minecraft bedrock.
It is way harder on Bedrock due to villages not spawning. I wish they did!
Mcpe players:..
11:30 but it is called an elytra that's how you say it
Fun fact the nether used to be flat in the older version
Damn he spent 100 days on your mom 😂
9:20 the Minecraft PS3 version had flat nethers in super flat. Why did they remove it??
29:30 As somebody who plays minecraft on a switch, this is exactly what it looks like.
Bro you called the nether wart nether ak
lol keep up the content!
Anyone else remember when their was a stronghold in superflat
make 200 days
I want 200 days of superflat it's interesting to see people survive in tough situations
Pls do a part 2
Now do this but in bedrock with a bonus chest for 100 days. We know you don't want to but do it as another bedrock challenge.
You can get sugar cane from a wandering trader
He said cuss 5:51
I thought that it WAS pronounced ehlytruh that's how I've always heard it pronounced in the context of beetles and other bugs so I assumed that was how you said it
My mom: You have a roof over Your head  Me: Well these guy does not have a roof over his head
Wait it’s not pronounced e-lie-tra?
I can’t believe he survived 100 days in the Netherlands! This man can truely survive any gamemode
if luke didnt like the slime sounds, he could have just turned hostile mob sounds down
13:51 they started reproducing faster than your momm😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Villagers don’t spawn in super flat
The sentence ‘i’m fighting William’ gets me everytime😂😂 i love 100 days video’s!!
8:23 “I FEEL GOOD”
11:35 you’re actually pronouncing elytra correctly
you sayed swer  word
I’d love another super flat video especially since I’m pretty sure you would be able to fight the dragon
I seriously pronounce elytra el-y-tra. not el-i-tra.
you sayed my mom and my granma
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
make 1K superflat
Good news, if you were to do 200 days now, you would be able to fight the Dragon.
Bro called netherwart netherrack
Didn't they change it so strongholds spawn in flat worlds now? Maybe Luke can go back and fight the dragon now.
Super flat on pocket edition!!! 100 days let's gooooo cmon!!!
Definitely bra I love these series
Idea : 100 Days minecraft vegan
"Hey Hey some netherack! useful for making potions" 🤣
Do 200 days pleas
Can't download the world 💔
That Alex thumbnail looks really SUS
I love this It's entertaining 😄
Make it 200 days
RIP horse🐴🐎
Do 100 days superflat with no structure
I remember I did one of these back in 1.2.5 or 1.3. It was suprosingly fun.
No swearing Luke
Now do it without villages
BTW you can get flint in superflat it's just in the nether🤓
i found the strond hole it was in the sky
how are you supposed to say elytra?!?!?!??!
Best video ever
He said witches!!!!1!!
The way he said scared and bucker😂
If you update the world to 1.18, all structures generate apparently. Try opening the world and see if an eye of ender works, because strongholds now should be available (also we all want 200 days of superflat)
I know it's been a while, but you could've cheated an end portal. It would have been cool seeing you fight the dragon.
10:40 If superflat world created with default settings, it doesn't include some structures, including strongholds. Editing superflat world generation settings can include some structures that doesn't spawn in default settings.
Make a sequel
A BUCKET
How do village spawn ib super flat?
We need 200 days
I wonder when part 2 will come out
Bro doesn't even know about slime chunks
Please make 200 days in super flat
No mobs spawn in water, that includes Slimes. So if you put water outside your compound, NO SLIMES(He’s never gonna see this though)!!!!
Superflat nether only exist in before 1.5
⛏
Bro found six diamonds in one blacksmith chest 😮
Day 28, "Uh nothing happened on day 28." There's him delibritely killing a cat.
Day 20, "Started off getting some arrows and killing some bitches, er i mean witches.
day 3 "you know i could kill the golem myself but I'm Scawed" when he said that i laughed so hard!!
I think you can leave the small slimes so the mob cap is filled and the big ones wont spawn
Wait the wither is willam afton
Fun fact: old XBOX 360 minecraft had a superflat nether ;)
3:26 Actually, yes... you can get flint in superflat Technically... in nether, but in a superflat =))
You know you can get weakness arrows from a fletcher villager and it'll work the same as a weakness potion for curing.
him *bucket* me hear it *fvckit*
Getting free arrows and killing bit*hs on my land. Wait sorry I meant witches. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
25:54
ITS CALLED A BASTION A BASTIO- Luke TheNotable: But did I ask?
degrade the version to 1.18 to get a stronghold in superflat
Here is my comment, can we please have more of this series
Plz more
I hate how inefficient your farms are
"get out of bed timmy or ill kill you're parents!" 🤣
Yes more 🎉
Super flat 200 days
4:57 "Bones and arrows"? Oh! Is that why skeletons have bows? Because of bows and arrows? That never occurred to me.
Pls continue
but still cool
hoody=pricey 45-50$ is good
Xbox 360 has a superflat nether!
This is 100 days in Kansas
Mongolia simulator

Luke bunny hops home Me tunnel Slimes don’t have rights

(Luke) “alright it’s day four and I’m not dead yet, and I have a BUCKET!” 😂
Someone I forgot there name and someone survived 10 years in superflat but did not die once but changed difficultys
4352
5:51 first time I heard a swear from luke
hueg respect adding day 69
slimes cant spawn on path blocks
More please
I'm 9 is that OK?
"I like bedrock, it's solid and sturdy, unlike your grandma"  Well, you are right, my grandma's been dead for decades lol
if a villager is a farmer you need to find to composter thingy that makes bonemeal then destroy it if they are wearing green there nitwits they cant get a profeshion
28:52
How so many villages how I played a searched so hard for a village
The house made of slime wasnt a very strong house infact it was very easy to destroy but it sent a message.
I recently tried this and now in the new version I’m pretty sure strongholds spawn in the sky
200 days in super flat. we need it lol
Wanna go bro haha
Horse be like at 26:00: Dang this white grass is delicious
Bro, your videos are unique. I swear. But can you just stop yelling randomly >.< it cuts  all the emotion and peace
5:51 he said WHAT
You could have smelted down all your used up iron gear to get iron nuggets. Unless you're playing on an old version
tbh I think he is pronouncing elytra correct
Pls stop anouncing to everyone in a 1km radius that I'm a "Minecraft fan"
plz do 200 days :))))
plz do 200 days :))))
💚🤎  love it
Someone needs to timestamp every single slime plap
This is 100% my favorite spin-off! I want to see 200 days!!!
LTN reminds me of the narrator from Battleblock Theater
If he does 200 days he should get a bunch of magma cubes and put a alot around his outer wall to bully the slimes
would be better if you did it on bedrock its harder and funner no structures spawn
I smell some foul play. At the last couple of days his levels keep swithing between 20 something and abolute zero.
i would love a 200 days superflat
In bedrock its harder
i expected the nether to be flat because on the legacy console versions, superflats very much contained superflat nethers
"And started killing b*tches on my land!" Wow bro very kid friendly
Ayo sus whne he said “i dont got hoes but atleast i got wiches”
January😐 February😐 march🙂 april🙂 may🙂 june😐 july😐 August😐 September💀 October😁 November🙂 December😁 idk why i made this its cringe lol
i love how you created a mini version of your 2000 days world in superflat
Pls do 200 days
I’ve just watches two minutes and I already hate the slimes
1000 days Superflat
Hardcore Superflat is Slime Hell
9:28 What?!?!
5:47 day 21 started off by getting some free arrows and killing bihes on my land or I mean witches.  🤣🤣🤣
The dislikes are from anti flatearthers.
0:33 lol I'd love to see you try this on bedrock then
did you credit luke thenotable?
this is me showing a little support, as requested
this would be impossible in bedrock superflat
May I ask what enchantment can you put on a compass?
11:35 But it is tho?!
I find it funny people only use the default superflat and never any of the other official world settings for it.
¨Get out the bed Timmy or I´ll kill your parents!¨                 -Luke the Notable 2021
11:35 it’s not?
Funfact for day 32: On the old console editions, the Nether was flat.
I remember on Xbox 360 Minecraft years ago when I played Xbox 360 Minecraft that the nether on a superflat world was also flat.
Luke: ugh, why did bats spawn? Me: *just deletes the world if bats spawn*
its actually now possible to find strongholds so it would be awesome if you continued the series and also try to get as many blocks as you can for a superflat collection
7:24
Path blocks prevent mob spawning as well
on the legacy console editions it was actually possible to toggle strongholds on superflat worlds
hi LTN did you know the game is actually beatable? I did many tests and the strongholds spawn in the sky!!!
"if you dont like it its probably because you're in the firm clutches of poverty" - Luke The Notable
As someone who plays frequently on creative flat worlds I understand the absolute hatred of slimes, so much that I made a constant repeating command block the kills all slimes forever
Do this again but instead set a command block in the ground to repeatedly murder all slimes
im pretty sure that the nether used to be flat IDK it was pre 1.12
I might actually play this one
5:50 LUKE WTF ITS A WITCH NOT A B**CH
waiting for this return from LukeTheNotable.  Yo dog, it would be a pleasant surprise to return to one of these one off 100 days   either way, love the content G!
The first time I heard luke swear while killin bitches i mean witches
hh
PLEEEASE continue this series!
You can get flint from nether
That's how I say elytra, any other way is incorrect B)
When 200 superflat ? Pls i need content !
Do 200 days please
Omg i thought this channing was family frendly
This is still my favorite 100 days
Superflat 100 days on pocket edition without structures is quite hard, but not impossible. Just watch Mogswamp.
I remember of playing super flat survival world on my ps3, but bcs of the console limitations the worlds still have a limit of 32.000x32.000, so if i was lucky enough i would get 4 viallages and that would be it...
2:50 the slimocaust
I know this video is old, but back on the xbox 360 (I believe) the nether was a big 100x100 square with a flat floor. All the nether mobs could spawn in here, and the spawn rates were crazy
another one pls
God Loves You All❤❤❤
No way I heard LTM swear
This was bonkers how much you got out of almost nothing.
13:48 Seeing as my mother had my brother 3 weeks late and my sister 3 days late, that is quite a low bar.
Cool
You should do 200 days super flat
I want 200 days
idk if anybody really cares but back in probably 2016 minecraft, the nether was indeed also super flat. it was just in a very small box of bedrock. the bedrock walls weren't smooth at all either, they were really rough looking. anyways that's my pointless piece of trivia
Did he just say bitches?
yEs more¨
10:00 *netherwarts
as someone who plays on max pov, this is so zoomed in
I've been watching Luke's videos for years, but I just noticed Alex has a pony tail in the thumbnails.
Why is all his merch his face 😂
all these comments that are only a few days or less old.....so everyone else is binging all the spin-off's as well after finishing the 3000 day video and the 3000 world tour
but.. that is how you pronounce elytra
How tf are you supposed to say elytra then??
Nah there is only one king of super this dude is impressive but the guy on bedrock nah this dude's 2nd
200 days
29:38 what’s the compass enchanted with?
Should have called it '100 days minecraft hardcore on your mom'
Good video
Flint is obtainable. You just have to travel to the Nether and find some gravel ez peasy
I'd like more super flat, but what more can be done?
Man I love your vids but watching you not build a villager farm and seeing you continue to eat pumpkin pie hurt me. Then you build an iron farm…
Lets hope for part 2 he understands the Mogswamp way of the Griddening and the Floodening, as well as the 100x100 circle
Too all the people that are saying “where part 2?” Luke just spent spent so much time doing 3000 days, so shut up
Where’s part 2????
:(:(:(:(:(:(:( aT 10:00 yOu sAiD nEtHeRaCk I '     M    Un subbing  :(:(:(:(:(     This is obviously a joke
Want a superflat nether play minecraft  PS3 edition
200 DAYS
Sooooo were we ever going to get that 200 days? 1000 days? That would be very notable of you.
Surely more of this is coming
not notable enough, reported!!!!
BRO YOU CANT GET DIAMONDS IN THE BLACKSMITHS CHESTS YOU COULD ONLY GET 1-3   DIAMONDS AND HE GOT 6

You surviving in a superflat world for 100 days is pretty notable
I started day 20 by killing some bitches on my land i meant witches
superflat is meant to be a creative mode environment
pls do a 100 days only Ocean in Hardcore ^^
love it
On consoles Minecraft had flat netther, idk why did they delete this feature tho.
2500
What did he say😮
3/4th's of a million likes, wow, never seen that before
How abt 100 days on badlands, or in an ancient city? Liked the vid
Just omg 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   13:45
I just tried the challenge and died on day 5. I almost had full iron to.
Wait it's not pronounced a-lietra
Luke: I want a super flat nether  -old xbox 360 minecraft-
hi
20:38 this is how I remember that Luke is a dad
*hi*
Wait, elytra is not pronounced like that?
Imagine bedrock edition we don’t have villages
Do 100 days amplified.
Do another super flat this was really cool
Somebody help me. The download link brings me to a media fire page that says that the download does not exist plz help @Luke TheNotable
Part 2?
gggggo gggggo

On the old console edition the nether IS flat on a superflat world except it’s the old nether
Please part 2 please
Pls make a 200 days I loved this video ❤
you are pronouncing elytra right, dont know what you are on about sire.
at 5:51 : When i see a furry outside my house.
This man talks about the world the way my grandpa talks about the earth
Luke: IM TIRED OF THE SLIME NOISE Me: Just lower your volume all the way down
:D
We need more of flat world!!!!
Hey you should do 100 in the end with the better end mod! It makes it live able and Gorgeous!
real title 100 days of PROFITS
One of the most unique 100 days from any yet
in flat without generated structures, if you gave yourself water and lava, you can melt down gold armor dropped by mobs to gold nuggets, and if you get enough of those you can make a gold ingot. If you didn't, and only have a bonus chest to work with, then it's a long process. First, you need copper by converting zombies to drowns and killing them for a rare copper drop. Then you need to craft a lightning rod. Then wait for a thunderstorm and place it near pigs. The lightning turns the pigs into zombified piglins. Kill them and they sometimes drop gold nuggets and you can craft an ingot
5:24 every racist person
plz do a 100 day with luckyblock superflat :>
HEYY LOVE TO SEE 200 DAYS OF THIS
UWU
12:14 Why did he say Lapis Lazuli like that 💀
How are you meant to pronounce elytra
I was in superflat and never found a village. Maybe it's cuz I like peaceful mode. I'm a chicken.
the wither storm is almost as fat as your mom when it's max level
its a crime we didnt get more of this series
18:47 the thing on his clothes changed colors from yellow to green to blue
u couldve made a cobblestone farm  16:05 nvm he did that :D
5:51 :O
The entire world is flat, *just like your mom*
Creeper: I'm inside your walls...
Ive beaten the wither exactly once on bedrock, never again. Idc about beacons that much
Also in the new update you now can find strongholds so he can beat the game.
Great green giraffe
its possible to smelt logs and get charcoal
You have to do more crimes on superflat than a normal Minecraft world ngl
This 100 days is probably the most hyped I am for a 200 days update
I like how he is mixing the item names leka calling nether wart netherack or blackstone fortreses
7:50
In super flat for me l cannot get villages
btw the nether on the xbox 360's superflat is flat
the slimes are the protesters who took lead bake in 2020 and tuke is the goverment
man i have to do this
Does anyone know what version he is playing on?
Well atleast my grandma is alive unlike your dad 🙂
Can you continue (You can get strongholds, ruined portals, outposts in new chunks)
It’s because the slime spawn box thingys
I thought you couldn't do anything in superflat! But this... This is fun.
8:23
Me when he said the way he pronounced elytra was wrong "what, that's  how I pronounced it".
Superflat nether used to be a thing, I don’t know when they changed it but it was definitely a thing, I’ve seen it with my own two eye
Would not work for bedrock addition, I use that lol
He is the only guy excited for a wandering trader
Yeah Jaron survived with no structures
Minecraft slime: You killed me  Luke: DO YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDE HOW LITTLE THAT NARROWS IT DOWN?
whens 200 days gonna come out?
Slime apocalypse 🤣
POV: you had your headphones at max volume during 25:00 ☠️
Alternative title: Luke gets harassed by slimes for 30 minutes
Dear sir Luke The Notable you probably get this a lot but you really make good videos and I really appreciate them you inspired me to do a lot of stuff on my Minecraft world's and I would like to thank you for your videos
If anyone wants to see more I'm making a series on this. Just no structures. Only a lava bucket and starter chest to assist me.
Fantasy Violence why that?
"and killing bitches, i- i meant witches"
I love how you talk like your happy haaaaa😍😍😏
Can we get a count on how many times he said (SLIMES)
I used to play java but my computer broke, so now all I have is bedrock... I don't hate it or anything but I wish the flat world generated villages like java does. I would play survival in flat worlds all the time, it's my favorite! The only thing that makes that possible for me is the existence of villages. Now I have to play NORMAL survival and its not as fun :(
Pls make 200 days
So apparently, in modern day Java Minecraft, the nether is not flat BUT, I was taking a trip down memory lane and playing Minecraft on my Wiiu and when I was making a new world; hovering over the super flat world checkbox, it said: “When enabled, a completely flat world will be generated in the Overworld and in the Nether.”. Which means that in old Minecraft, the nether was super flat but nowadays in Java it’s not
the download doesnt work anymore can you fix it?
The wandering trader is actually good in super flat survival
Peaceful mode
Me, a bedrock player:
I’m 6 Yr old
5:49 oof.

you can get flint in the nether gravel can spawn no matter super flat and intense both have gravel spawn
Diamonds real diamond !
5:48 Tommy with that clip killed a women feeling good
Turn on strongholds, you can go to the end then
If you ever want to try this again but want more info before going into it, the youtuber mogswamp has a lot of pointers for a superflat survival, he goes through how superflat changes through the different versions and the different things you can obtain (and also how to obtain them). That aside this was still enjoyable to watch and you did a great job with all your progress.
"It's just so nice to hear nothing but *SILENCE*"

Does your dad actually work at Minecraft?

Make an infinite water and lava source
Luke: making iron farms is cruel Also luke: Enslaves an entire village casually
Why has this videos comment section been overrun by crayon eating toddlers lmfao
Luke's videos inspire me to try new things in Minecraft and actually want to play a Superflat world. Every time I watch these videos I'm like "Ooh, that's brilliant!"
You pronounce elytra perfectly in my opinion.
So cool
Ha did u say the b word I'm sorry its funny😂😂😂😂

We must have 200 days
16:31

This guy can go to the nether on superflat, I didn't even know that was possible.
YOU SAID THE B WORD
how do u get a super flat world?
Play on playstation with the new 1.18 update it doesn't let you play super flat cause super flat doesn't exist but flat ejust but also you had to being creative to the load of A-war all night and you can't even get achievements
Luke the flatable

This video is intended for audiences 13+ years old for the following reasons Fantasy Violence Violent References Suggestive Themes Crude Humor  you forgot one: swearing
"And after selling some sticks to this idiot" had me laughing.
Luke TheFlatable
probably a known fact, but on older editions of the game, like the PS3 version, and the non-updated PS4 version, the nether is superflat in a superflat world! it has bedrock / netherack walls, and a bedrock ceiling, and is basically just a giant empty cube with fire
Hey luke the notable eyes of ender now work in superflat maybe find the end 😎
WHERE IS THE DOWNLOAD IT DOES NOT WORK :(
did he just say b——— ?
Why alex skin
Fun fact: on the old legacy edition the nether used to be flat and have giant walls and a ceiling of netherack
can you plz make a part 2
love this its so good :D
Super flat hardcore, well, super flat survival in general seems like a very easy task. But it’s way more complicated than it seems. It’s such a neat concept and a really cool challenge
Wait Elytra isn't pronounced E-lie-tra, but El-e-tra?
You should have started with a chest
Why are most of these comments so early
you could also build up four blocks to kill iron golems so they cant reach you
In super flat I’ve actually found a stronghold
You should go to 200 days
it is pronounced elytra...your not british
I love how he yells the word silence
I really like this series! Pls continue!
Why do you call it a weaponsmith? ITS A BLACKSMITH
Continue the series
"Kill some bitches"- @Luke TheNotable

Bro what’s this comment arrangement
Fun fact: strongholds DO generate in superflat and they are ALWAYS at the same coords
hello
hello
24:58 uahh it's so transPARENT 😩👌
Try a super flat world on bedrock. it’s a lot more challenging as villages don’t spawn ( note you should use a bonus chest otherwise you can’t do anything )
8:20 im pretty sure you can't find that many diamonds in a blacksmith
10:00 nether rack?
you can fight the ender dragon in superflat
22:51 damn man leave my grandma alone
Have anyone also seen Ibxtoycat's flat world?
wow i never thought of luke saying no to farming
Killing baby hoglins: ✅  Killing iron golems:❌
Nether used to be flat, it wasn’t bad.
I just realized he said "No golems allowed" Instead of the slimes 1:06
Luke: tHesE SliMEs ArE mAkING Me Go iNsaNe Me: Turns off the Volume from Hostile Mobs...
only thing i wonder is why he didnt put carpet on the ground to unslimify the space lol
Comment
“Of course about a thousand slimes protested, so I killed them!” - The Chinese Government
Mogswamp: Amateur.
New comments yay  Hardcore 100 days in classic Skyblock

**Insert funny comment here**
top comment
26:05 Gotta love how he screams "SILENCE!"
Could you do 200 or 1000 days in super flat?
5:49 i caught you luke
I’m sorry but when he said back to reality I thought of “back to reality oop there goes gravity.”
2:25 *chinese national anthem*
1oo days deep dark
Whoever made super flat must really really like green
I’m sorry, you’re killing *WHAT* on your land?
200 days would be nice after 3000 days
Can someone please explain why all ltns vids are suddenly getting so many comments from like a day ago
Didn’t realize that it was possible to do all that, definitely want two hundred days!
Rip technoblade
You don’t have ovaries 😂
“Get out of bed timmy or I’ll kill your parents” 🤣🤣🤣

The nether is actually flat in a flat world in Legacy Console
2:23 Donald Trump be like

Joke is on you my mom is dead ☠️
huch fan
aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

You can finish the game in 1.18.2 or 1.19 nin superflat looking forward to the 200 days
So we not gunna talk about him calling netherwart nether rack?
👁🫁👅👁
I'm surprised he didn't make a cobblrstone generator
fun fact: legacy console edition has a flat nether, plus its the only console edition to have villages in superflat.
To all those still commenting asking for him to do stuff or giving him advice, this video is over a year old, he won't see your comments at all lmao, so don't waste your energy
There is actually a  way to get flint in superflat,  if you go to the nether you can get gravel.
200 days when?
Another one
200 days when?
Make 200 days super flat
LTN: IF you wanna see 200 days like and sub  *vid gets 3/4 of a million likes   LTN:yeah no I’m not doin it
Did you guys know that inside the armorer and black smith houses there are attics that you can go in and get a chest with better loot try it
awhile ago when i was little there was a superflat nether
Hey luke they just updated the superflat in 1.18.2
Fun fact: on the console edition quite a way's back (like, before 1.8 I think, could be wrong), the nether in a superflat world was completely flat. No fortresses, mobs running amok. It was chaotic and amazingly flat.
In Xbox360 Minecraft if you build a portal on a flat world the nether flat too
The the fact that Luke the notable use a Alex skin is funny as well
The nether DID used to be flat. They just changed it quite fast, slapping it out of existence.
It IS AH-LY-TRA
End is not in flat wolrd
plz make another one when you're free
Hi iv bin a fan for a while but I couldn't text till I got one
Minecraft
i love smoter.
I don’t know if it’s good or bad
I’m imagining doing this on bed rock where no structures generate
Odd that there arent superflat nether. I remember on the xbox there was a superflat nether
In 1.18.2, you can get to the end on superflat. Also, the strongholds are always at the same place.
Wait…. It’s NOT pronounced “eh liy truh”?
If you fish you can get water bottles
200 days lol                          plz
9:25 on old versions of minecraft the nether was flat which was quite the sight to see
PLZ MORE
PLZPLZ MORE
26:53 I just noticed this but when did you get the netherite to build a lodestone
On bedrock we don't have superflat structures
On newer updates superflat worlds actually do have strongholds so that’s something you can do if you ever make a 200 days of this
yes netherrack for making potions
Why haven’t we gone back to this
just saying he did a lot on superflat only
How to live on flat  Step 1: activate bonus chest before turning on world type flat Step 2: that's it.......just do that
I remember you
wait its not prononced e-ly-tra
i wish you could beat the dragon but maybye the wither could be the finnal boss
Elytra is pronounced the way you said it, anybody who says it differently is weird and should be ignored
200 days pls
Language
Wither = Uncle Wilbur BUT ALSO William
am i the only one who remembers flat nether?
the energy from "selling sticks to this idiot" is radioactive
i think luke has no more sanity for slimes anymore
20:24 pigman on a stridor on day 69
Normal survival ppl: Where are the slime chunks? Luke: Where is a place with no slimes
1.15 spawns the stronghold.
Minecraft: Indiana Simulator
Fighting William what'd he do
fun fact: XBOX 360 superflat actually HAD a superflat nether, but this was many years ago.
Verbal wise at day 6 (that is when I'm typing) he is homeless since he doesn't have a roof over his head
Pc players are lucky idk if my game is broken or not but in super flat nothing spawns except grass dirt and bedrock on Xbox Minecraft not Xbox One edition btw Xbox One edition does have mobs and villages
Just started an superflat world and i have to say, EVEN on Easy, the slimes make the world NOT easy. I also used a village house for my first base.
Hey Luke slimes and stop spawning if there is water and now you can enter the stronghold in 1.18.2
If you update the world to 1.18.2, strongholds, ruined portals, pillager outposts and mineshafts can generate.
*✨iTs nIcE tO hEaR✨ nOtHiNg bUt👹SILENCE👹*
How is eleytra pronounced!? I’ve been saying it just like he is
HOW DID HE GET WATER
5:52 anything want to say the class
Is it a bit weird how he spawn next two villages i super flat there’s no trees no villages
frankly I would love to see him continue this one
a apple a day keeps the slimes away... nothing keeps the slimes away
1:23
1:24
This guy said the B word
I remember the super flat nether it was on Xbox 360
hey make your slime house a bouncy castle
Legends say the horse is still there in the nether
This video perfectly demonstrates how op villages can be
200 days ?
Hi there I love your 100 days world
Question, wouldn't paths also prevent slime spawning?
if say EE-LIE-TRA as well lol
2 walls, attack on slime
200 days
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hey luke here is a tip: to make no mobs spawn at your house you put the torches on the ground too not just on the wall
5:23 No Slimes sorry yoy can't have any you don't have rights
Thought I'd mention, on Minecraft for the Xbox 360, the nether was super flat. It's not flat on the current bedrock edition.
I love your minecraft videos, they never cease to crack me up. My brother and I look forward to them.
Fun fact: minecraft nether used to be flat on Xbox one edition if you do a 100 days flat nether
It’s basically Illinois
He should do a 200 days on this
He should flood the entire world with water at the start so no mobs can spawn its easy if you know water mechanics and then u wanna build a base at 0,0 so its hard to get lost i dont mean the entire world with water but a reasonable amount like to you closest village witch should be that far if u want villagers at your base and plan on expanding do it to a village if not just do it as far as your render distance or whatever
It’s netherwart
Luke there used to be super flat nether. If any of you even remember the super flat nether you are a minecraft veteran
But flat with structures is really easy, you should play without them, so you have to get iron andvillagers de hard way
This comment section is filled with 7 year olds
Why don’t you change you skin?
Jesus loves you all
Are villages the only structure that can generate in the overworld?
I remember back in the console legacy days, there used to be a flat nether whenever you generated a su[perflat world.
23:01 made me laugh hard😂
23:01 made me laugh hard😂
Minecraft 100 days idea: 100 days in superflat Minecraft but the world is, from top to bottom, stone pressure plate, sand, tnt. Basically the floor falls out from under you.
More then a year later, here we go again
BTW You pronounced elytra Correctly
He said bichess when he said witch
Can you please make 200 days
But that is how you pronounce elytra
Try 100 days of skyblock, or skyblock one block
14:12 Bats start spawning in the dark if there's suspended blocks for them to hang from. So on superflat, they only spawn if you've built something in the air.
dude continue this, on 1.18.2 you can go to the end, its possible in new chunks
play a lava superflat, its not easy to get to but possible in vanilla mc, i've done it before
In 1.18.2  you can now go to the end in superflat because they made more structures spawn other than just villages so you can go to the end like so he sees
Has anyone else heard luke saying b#$ches??
“Get out the bed Timmy or I’ll kill your parents” Damn that was dark
Even H is your grandpa technoblade because  I'm pretty sure that he hates government
Some advice, if you put a farmer villager on your own farm, it will farm if you do it right.
More!!!!!!!!!! plz
I notices that every 100 day video lasts excactly 30 minutes
Your just glad ur not on BEDROCK EDITION cuz there’s no villages on bedrock superflat
11:36 That is how it’s pronounced
superflat 200 days
It’s not pronounced elytra..?
More
YOU SWORE!
could you continue this seires
So im not the only one binging LTN 100 days
pls continue this seires i love it
39 buried 0 found
9:59 hey hey some netherack
In the wii u version of mimecraft if ur in a superflat and u go to the nether its actually flat
You should try 100 days bedrock edition if you haven't
how much would you have paid someone to make a "remove slimes" setting for superflat
Over one year later, “it was a real kick in the ovaries spawning in soul sand…” still absolutely takes me out l
We need 200 days
"hey! some netherrack!" *proceeds to mine nether wart*
9:30 on the ps3 edition of minecraft the nether was flat in a super flat
200 days!
bats spawned cuz they usually span in cave but since there are no caves they spawn in the overworld which is 3 block up
Blackstone fortress
"About a thousand slimes protested my wall so I killed them"  Ah yes, Democracy
ples continu with the siriys
How did he get saplings though?
If you do 200 days in superflat strongholds spawn as of 1.18
Part 2 maybe?😳😅
u cant do this without bonus chest on bedrock XD
I love it when Luke screams and I wonder what tors thinks
I say this is my favorite one :p
200 days or.... something bad will happen!!!!
Use F3 + G to view chunk borders. Build fences around the borders of every chunk, then check to see if slimes are in one. If they are, it's a slime chunk and you shouldn't build there. If they aren't - congratulations! You have a slime-free zone. Slimes only spawn in specific chunks, determined by the world seed, also known as "slime chunks."
He cursed
Hope this series comes back
Me: checks comments to see someone talk about how he didn't pronounce elytra Unprofessional: ill e tra Propper: ill eye tra
You keep saying i have no witches, but where are yours?! WHERE ARE THEY???
No witches?
(Edit,  neither is true. No idea why i thought that. Lol)  In bedrock the nether is flat, and the end fortress floats in the sky
You can go to the End!!! If you /locate the stronghold it is there, the eyes now work, they updated it.
20:21 Piglin strider jockey to the left, pretty rare and a free strider w/saddle.
Why is your skin alex
PLSS  200 I neeeeeed 200 dayyyyssss nooowow!!!!!!    I even givvvvvveee Pizzza!!!   Here: 🍕
I liked the video and I'm already subscribed to you. And now that I'm writing the comment, don't you think we deserve a 200 days? Btw, I will always remember your videos because they are *notable*
It's called elytra You got it right
lmfao the way those iron golems are running at 29:03 gets me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
how did he make glass bottles if theres no glass?
I feel like u have no life man, no offence u make great videos but touch some grass someday😊😊
1:23 I'm swcared. Alright it's day 4, I'm not dead yet, and I have a BUCKET
The guy talks about smiles like my grandpa talks about the government had me laughing hard
More vids please
It’s so funny- my brain immediately registers the schlopping of slimes as background noise because I was constantly playing on Java super flat worlds for YEARS
Countiu
I’m quite late but I’m not sure if this only works with bedrock but again. I don’t know if it would work cuss I play on ps4 but if you go back to when 1.13 came out you can customise super flat worlds and you can add structures caves ect that means u could get a strong hold and beat the game (do not replay to this comment if you’re gonna argue and tell me I didn’t have to say this or something)
The slimes are hate you😂
2:48 eren  mode activated
In Superflat, Wandering Traders are saints. Sand, Sugarcane, Cactus, Fish, so much stuff.
3:00 ahhh the clasics
WOWOWOWOWOWOWOOWOW
This looks like the Netherlands (my country)
8:03 He said nothing was happening when he was chasing a cat XD
N̶o̶w̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶B̶e̶d̶r̶o̶c̶k̶
You mean Tilleym
this is the comments
idea for a video 100 days in an ancient city
9:59 lol he said netherack instead of nether wart
7 yr old me before knowing about creative and thinking superflat was the only possible world generation
5:50 nice
What the heck is an "end fortress" or "blackstone fortress"?
"Some fortresses and black fortresses"
Still waiting for 200 days
you should replay this, there’s a glitch in the new version where you can go to the end
When he brought up how to say elytra. I finally realized why hermitcrafters call them “wings”
Fov on 69 lol
Does anybody know that he mistook nether wart for netherrack
do 200 days
Horse...
more of this plz
the mom jokes are 🤌🏻
Make another 100 day Superflat
Surper  flat 1000 days he covered the whole world in carpets slabs and buttons
You cured my headache
200 days superflat
can you do 100 days with education addition?
This was not a year ago
We'll be back I promise you !
There used to be superflat nether , it was like an enclosed cube
hi
Bro it’s been an year make part 2 >:( (please)
you should try it in 1.18.2, strongholds now spawn in superflat worlds, it's just a problem because the eyes of ender can't locate it.
I wish I could do this but I only have bedrock. I'm not complaining or anything, snow having physics is clearly a better trade off.
Are you haking in the chest are 6 diamond
Nice
weapon smit 👌
10:00 man you called nether wart nether rack
10:00 my man called nether wart netherrack.
Superflat nether used to exist I used to play minecraft on the 360 and would create superflat worlds and go to the nether and the nether was flat, it was pretty weird to look at
I pronounce elytra the same why you do i dont rlly like when people say “elitra”
So ltn when will 200 days come out?
200daysssssssssssssssssssssss
Ayo 200 days?
If only he played on 1.18.2. He coulda beat the game that way still love the vid, but I actually beat the dragon in superflat on 1.18.2, was the same as on any other world
They added the stronghold and other stuff recently into superflat but it’s best to start the world in 1.17 in my opinion because then the Y level is really low so you can also have mineshafts spawn and stuff
Luke the not able to die in hardcore
Maybe the stronghold is there, just the eyes don’t work. If this is true, make 200 says
Me when I have 10 doors in my house:manion
11:32 I say it as elytra too so I ain’t angry
11:35. wait.  it is not pronounced elytra?
Mincraft rost 1 your mom repruduses more then slime  wen you try killing a big one
Helppppppppppp stop the slimeeeeeeesssss!!!!
I would want a 200 days of this than 3000 days
´Slimy Businessˋ
Feet are like the flat world they are slimy
HE REALLY SAID I AM KILLING BITCHES ON MY LAND BUT THEN HE SAID I Mean witches Yea witches😅
Do you mock the poor?
😍😍😍
I like this when i didny see this in 2021!

17:19

the only end poratal in superflat is a homemade 1
Bruh bruh. ruh
5:51 killing the _______
NICE!
It’s day 4 and I’ve got a B U C K E T
The Minecraft Xbox 360 edition super flat world HAS a flat nether world
What do you mean.... that's literally how  elytra (e- light- tra) is pronounced, what are you talking about?
BUCKET TTTTTTT
Continue the series plz
For me day 100 I’ll have stone tools lol
Of all the 100 days spinoffs, this is the one I'd like to see continued the most
i love how most of his videos are exactly 30 minutes. 👌
“I can cut it up, cause I’m an expert editor.”  Description:  Editor: Tors
Try it on bedrock
I lost some braincells when he said “blackstone fortress”. It’s a BASTION
Not me playing on console and saying that i should go back to editions and play superflat again but also knowing I just never will.
"Eye of enders"???
A fence and a hole is really all I need XD
10:00 ITS NETHER WART
He said elytra wasn’t how you say it but it is
your dad actually works for Minecraft?
👍
200 days for this
Petition for Luke to make 100 days skyblock
I just made a super flat world I can’t do the challenge because there’s no villages how did you make the villages
If you run in super flat you will never get hurt even a straight line no slimes can detect you and hurt you they usually jump out of the way
Yo did he make an iron farm?
continu plz
1258 87
all of luke's 100/200/300/1000/2000/69 day videos are very notable
I’m genuinely surprised the nether wasn’t flat, back in my console days before 1.16 I SWEAR the nether was flat
ok
I want you to do a flat day 200
Please do 200 days superflat
Did you know that one a book is better than too late chanting table?😂
Did you know that only one left you a box for you Santino area it’s better than to
luke: "got me a bow and started killing bitchs i mean witchs"  me who didn't know he cussed: WHAT
get yourself a fishing rod, for real.
200 day's please!
All I wonder is how you got the water. How?
I was grinding pokemon sun for a shiny while watching your video and then i just forgot to play the game for like 20 minutes
Did you know that the nether used to be flat in xbox360
Omg
You need to be on Minecraft 1.15 to find a natural end stronghold
I heard Bickh without the k
MORE!
Omg luke said the b word!!!!!!
200 days when?
This was really fun, i loved it Luke i want more kakakak
Full diamond armor In flat land hardcore
wow
I just started a super flat world and I oddly like it a lot more than a regular world. I can build anything I want and I really like the challenge if getting certain blocks. I don't have to waste a lot of time mining for stuff too. And I don't have to do a bunch of terraforming just to build something.
Get us that 200 Days Superflat!   Please 👍😜
Have you done 100 days in the old MC mod, Skull & Bones? :P
You should do old superflat cuz you can mess with the blocks and structures
Luke tried copyrighting the term 100 days LMAO never forget how scummy this dude is
“I- I- meant witches” - LTN - Says The B Word
Pt 2 pls
8:15 you can't get that many diamonds in one blacksmith's chest. You probably cheated
No mobs in hardcore that's lowkey sus
@Luke TheNotable you should update this series to the new update! They added Strongholds so you can beat the end.
200 days plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Make 200 DAYS!!??
lol i was watching while playing mc and found a fortress within SIGHT RANGE of my portal about 200 blocks away
You boring becuase You speak to Much
It seems like slime ranchers
This was… intense
Commented
Grian is crying at the emerald house
Dude can you post the world download again it's saying the file is missing
5:50
I’ve been waiting for a yet now when will you make a part 2
Normal world: Wow, I finally found some slimes! Superflat: WOULD THEY JUST STOP FOR 5 FKN SECONDS
26:43 yes i hate them as well. They are so annoying because they are cowards; they attack me then run when i fight back
so its fine to want to wipe out all slime but when one German guy wants to get rid of some people hes the worst guy in the world
22:53 my grandma is dead luke
He said it 3:01
you tried to kill a cat
Continue
there are so many really good jokes that are overlooked due to it being a 30min video. i applaud your humor, it’s all about the cut offs, the timing, the tone. everything is PERFECT. hilarious. 🦶
15:57 I was playing terraria while watching this video and what you just said basically explains the entire game
I liked subscribed and I'm commenting......        where is 200 days and super flat
9:05 I love the way your map looks
hey guys
200  days
You made my childhood Minecraft into a very entertaining thing :D   (Aka the xbox version Minecraft and can have super flat world)  :D
Wait it’s not pronounced “elitra”-?
Fun fact, he said slime every day
Like your mom
In the old ps4 minecraft the nether is flat idk I remember it being flat once though so yeah
not a notable thing to say notable
It would be interesting if you did 200 days
Yo you say bit**
Don't worry Luke I subscribe weeks ago
did you know that in the old bedrock edition of minecraft if you made a suoerflat world the nether would not only have bedrock on the top and bottom but all four sides would have bedrock also and the entire nether would be flat
Speaking from experience doing survival with a friend on the old Xbox One Edition: you can't legitimately beat just normal superflat. On Java there's no stronghold, and on the aforementioned version there's no fortress and therefore no blazes
Before the bees or village update on console legacy edition nether was flat in a flat world
(. (.    5:50 ------
hi
I cant do this challenge cuz i play in bedrock
who remembers the good old flat nether? super fun to run around and spawn withers in creative!
10:00 mans said nether rack instead of nether warts.
200 days
Fun fact: the old neather had a super flat
An apple a day keeps the slimes away! 😃 . No it doesn’t nothing does 😞
by the way u can shovel dirt co slimes dont spawn
technically at day 88 when you finished the wool to keep out the slimes you were approximately listening to their sounds for 1760 minutes or 29.3333333 hours so i see why that would annoy  you
22:51 jokes on u both of my grandmas are dead 🥲
Stop talking bad about our mom and grangma
Slime town
At 5:51 He says “Killing Bitches”
Question: How did you get sapling Luke
Wait, it’s NOT pronounced “el eye tra”?
Please make more
“It’s solid and sturdy unlike your grandma.” -LukeTheNotable
there is a way for an end portal in superflat, however it would probably kill all the villagers. you have to make structures generate to the point that strongholds will generate in the air
It is pronounced elytra
Trust me LTN, you DON’T want a supper-flat nether. A long time ago on bedrock, there was one. It was a nightmare. Ghasts and pigmen would always spawn, and when the got attacked by the ghasts, they would attack you. So…lets not get a super-flat nether.
This is the first I heard someone so happy to see a wandering trader.
Well CONGRATULATIONS!! on saying your first swear word
luke u could bone blocks from the nether
I am 10
200 Days - [Minecraft Superflat]
28:27 Isn’t money and emeralds the same thing -
Rewatching this in 2022 because it's Just so cool?
Day 46 weird fov
With the new 1.18.2 update you can actually go to the end
I would eradicate the slimes even if I wasn’t stuck with them 24/7
No it is pronounced eletra
You should do 200 days In 1.18.2, there is a bug that lets you be able to use eyes of ender to find the stronghold, as well as new structures can generate like pilliger outposts.
Luke exist slimes creates a god-awful noise Luke  SHUT THE FUNK UP
Killkng b!tches - i mean witches    This had me laughing so hard 😂😂😂😂
I really want 3000 days hardcore
make a 200 super flat plz
Bro said b#####
There is a way to get to the End on a superflat, you have to create your world in version 1.16.1, because this version has a bug that makes strongholds generate on superflats. Eyes of Ender still don't work though, so you have to just walk across it with some luck. Also you can get sand by trading with wandering traders.
Wait, it's not pronounced El-i-tra?
How did he get the first 2 sheep? And the glass botles??
A yes(bLAcKStOne fORtrEs)
The viligers will constentley spawn golems
im so empathetic, he didnt have to use carpet, he couldve just pathed it 🤣
Nice house
WOW you said biches in front of children
200 please?
"and killing b!c@es... uh i mean witches
Can we have another one please
Infinity sheep more like sheep generater
Fun fact : In some versions of minecraft, when you put the world on superflat, the nether would be too.
End stone fortress
Black stone fortress
dang, was hoping this video wopuld be about how to superflat on bedrock.
i would like to see 200 days in super flat
Nois
200 days in superflat?
Witches more like bitches 5:51
Continue this
Fun fact on xbox 1 minecraft the neither is also flat
I’m scawd
play amplified coward
At 26:01 it looks like the horse is eating the carpet.
Fc c vgy             here do          Dd r f gg        No sir go away
200 Days pls
please make a 200 days superfat
Fun fact: the nether in a superflat was once flat
I wish I could be as notable as Luke
100 days making a village in a certain style? medieval, modern etc…
You say elytra correctly….
Lol the fact that he put fake stuff in the chest lol
Me:mojang why is there so many slimes in minecraft superflat mojang:because I love to see people suffer 😁 me again:🙂🔫
I like how his merch is just shirts with his face and different colors.
make part 2 plz
Try and beat minecraft on pocket edition but SUPERFLAT- Luke: sure.  It's hard cuz they don't have villages in Pocket.
People: can I be Steve now? Minecraft: yes. In 100 years :)  Edit: *I heard bi***es dude.* Evidence: go close to your speakers. You can hear the Bit.
"they started reproducing faster than your mom."
30 min exactly
200 days....we want it
Do 100 days in server!
comments something because I don't know what to write its just great
5:51
This is why super flat is for creative
You can find a Stronghold it takes a long time to find  it's out in the open
You do say elytra the way you said
LTN normally: (the thing everything in minecraft has nightmares about) LTN to iron farms: no do. too cruel.
I agree
Yes 200 days pls
Alternate title: Attack on slime
Doing this on bedrock was very interesting. Villages don’t spawn so we’d enable a bonus chest and built a house outta dirt. And that’s about all you can do without cheating
he said "Today I'll be surviving 100 days in Minecraft super flat." and I thought that he was going to make a "your mom is super flat" joke
Today we beat the ender dragon on a super flat world, but it is not the ender dragon it is the flat dragon!
I've been losing my locks out for so long my thumb turned num 😐 well ur vid helped time pass I just have 10 more to go 😭
This dude got banned of arthropods
GOOODSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUSUSUS
GOGOGOGO
if you hated the slimes why didnt you just make a giant giant platform like 64 blocks high up... you could of had made it from a lot of materials :P
im sorry...elytra isnt pronounced elytra??
continue the series to 1000 day
Hey Luke I pronounce elytra like you
You also should do 100 days in caves because their very plentable for diamonds so have a notable day and have fun.
I hope you don't say I started killing bitches on my land cause honestly n that actually funny LTN.
100 days sky block?
Please do more of this friend. I'd love to see some man-made mountains and crazy stuff like that. I'd love to see it.
Honestly baffled he didn't make a mob spawner tower. It's suuuper efficient in super flat
Why’s cookie god here😂
5:50, PG LUKE!
Fun fact, in a flat world on the Xbox 360 edition (atleast thats the only version I can confirm this happening on) the Nether actually did spawn flat aswell. I can’t remember if fortresses would spawn but I’m pretty sure they didn’t.
Hi..ok thanks
Plz do a part 2
I could never cuz I’m on bedrock no villages or anything it’s only like playable in creative
Bro I remember on the Xbox 360 the nether was flat on super flat worlds
Pls do 200 days I liked,subscribed and commented
please do 200 days i liked
Good to bed it’s 12:32
Can’t wait for 200 days! I started my own superflat survival world (in normal cuz I’m a wuss) But it’s super fun and I would love to see you do more!
200 days please i liked
Will there be a 200 days?
Deb rock
How u got 10 iron 🤔
E
This man tortured himself for our entertainment
Woooooooooow
Man I miss when the nether was super flat
Wow
you can throw the iron armor from villagers in the furnace to get 1 iron bar
luke: finds glass   luke 2 seconds later: *orgasms*
Petition for 200 days pls I really enjoyed

Anyone else waiting for another upload like this

Why don't you make 200 days
Am I the only one that heard him say "ooh netherrack this will be good to make some potions" 9:59
200
You should have a skin bro
I’ve watched this at least 20 times. I think the clopping of slimes drove me insane.
after looking at the comments, imma have to say that the majority of lukes audience is way younger than i thought. (Either theyre young or mildly autistic)
do rl craft
Anyone else watching on VR
The way you said elytra is the way I say it to
Slime ranchers looks different from when I last saw it
Alternative title: whatch Luke the notable go insane while trying to kill slimes
PLEASE do a 200 days one!
what i like about luke thenotable is just the way he screams gets me evry time
I am trying it out
WEĚÈÈEEEEEÈEEĒ
DiD hE jUsT cUsS?!
At 5:51 is SOOOO funny
200 DAYS!!!!
java
Try doing it on bedrock edition I did but with only 1 bonus chest
Continue pls
5:51 Luke Is So Dumb 😂🤣
If you are rich enough have you thought about smelting Armour to get iron?
hell yeah, get another one of these done yo
Oh next time use an axe or hatchet bcuz it does more damage great way to kill slimes
quake pro is the only acceptable fov
I imagine his voice as if a golden retriever had one
"the nether isn't flat"    Me who is keeping a much older version of Minecraft that actually does have flat nether in superflats: hah it may not have cat mobs but it does have cows.
200 days pls
Cookie god pog
26:06 best part
"They can reproduce faster than your mommy" Luke the Notable more like Luke the Questionable
Bro you missed one with a skeleton skull
Do a part 2 I know I’m late ⏰
9:23 fun fact: the wii u edition of Minecraft actually had a superflat nether
5:51 what did you just say 😨
Technically Luke can call his house the slut
Imagine  if he did a 100 day survives but if he gets hit he restarts it that would be hard
...Why do I feel like the whole video is sped up a little bit...
8:19 u can only get 4 diamonds from blacksmith chest 0_0
11:14
Could have gotten yellow glass panes  with silk touch at the village for your windows
200 days
I’ll do everything
I like the part  5:51 when he sayd "Killing BICHES on my land" "Oh i mean wiches! Yeah wiches" i was dieng 😂
This scares me that he makes the 100 days videos exactly 30:00 minutes
Killing bitches, that got me crying.
how did you get seed and sapling
Plz 200 days
Why you can go to the nether on the superflat challenge but cannot go to the overworld on the nether challenge?
Just killing some b*tches I mean witches I meant witches
Just killing some b*tches I mean witches
I wanna see 100 days skyblock
So we may all like these videos but the real question is who draws the thumbnails?
13:58 😐
do a another series i like it please do it :)
I like how little this guy knows about minecraft. But this is still interesting
Me: *cries in bedrock edition*     I know I’m kinda late to here and yes, I play Roblox but I can see minecraft if I want
This video was notably the most notable superflat video ever made
Where is day 200
You should have said instead of hoes then your mom
Can you continue the series please we love watching you
This is like my 5th time watching this video idk why I enjoy this so much
3:09
just started my hardcore superflat world
"some netherrack" *_sir, that's nether wart_*
How did you get 10 iron for 1 iron golem are you Sirius? Your cheating
It’s even harder to do it in bedrock because villages can’t generate, so you have to get a bonus chest because they have a change to spawn with saplings in them
Why are the comments so fresh-         So we're all just here huh?
Wuaah aaaaah haaaa hahahahaha
Instead of wasting an axe’s durability on breaking leaves, which really bothers me, JUST USE A STINKIN HOE! It’s SO MUCH FASTER!
You should do 500 days
69
Can we just appreciate that the time of this video is 30 mins straight Edit:I’ve watched this 4 times I’m not late
11:34 wait it’s not pronounced elytra? (A-ly-tra)
I’m just writing this comment so you continue the series
In PS3 Minecraft (*GAAASSSPPP* EEEWWWW), super flat mode is customisable. I had fun with that.
Haha lol did he just say bitches when he was killing that which
lol this must by boring
please have a part 2
Fun fact: in the legacy console versions of the game the superflat nether is also flat and also very small as there was a bedrock wall surrounding it
Did anyone notice the vid ends at exactly at 30:00 thats pecific
lol there is no 200 days
200 days of super flat
I've genuinely never heard Elytra pronounced any way besides "Eh-lie-tra"
Can you do 120 days skyblock
give us 200 days
Sorry for corrupting your wither footage. I hope you still love me.
Yes yes
On a regular super flat world no there is no end portal, but if you use a preset super flat world and set it to regular super flat height the structures will spawn in the air
Is anyone else surprised that Luke got tired of farming
the cleric villager fram netherrack
This is impossible in bedrock
Villages don’t spawn in bedrock they used to but not any more
Luke you have survived 100 day in Minecraft but how about survival 100 day in terraria
Yup its now Nether rack not nether wort got it
can i join you with the next 100 days
7:48 “I also tried to get a Weaponsmith but he wanted to be a farmer. Welp, it’s his life” LOL
Luke TheFlatable
Hate is strong word, and a strong feeling
where the glass bottles came from....? ha
Lol I killed some bi**h
uhhh you cabt use ender eyes in superflat cuz it has no structure except villages... so no stronghold. so no end. so no ender dragon.
11:34 wait elytra isn’t pronounced ee-lie-tra ?
Here comes the nostalgia
wait till he trys "pocket" superflat
my grandma is dead 22:50.

200 days would be great
I maybe a few months late but you have to turn strongholds on in a superflat world to find the end portal
Still waiting for 200 days in super flat
200 days
I didn’t know you can find villages in super flat
Hello Luke, I have and Xbox 360 and the first addition of Minecraft and I did have a hunger bar. I love your videos keep up the good work. and the nether was flat in my flat world.
It is called elytra And the y is pronounced ie
I kept thinking through half the video that he could've just gotten magma blocks from the nether and put them outside his walls to kill the slimes
The funny thing about the Nether is that a superflat version exists in the legacy console versions. I remember visiting it regularly with my brother.
200 day’s pls
Everyone subscribe to this man he’s amazing and I hope he does 200 days
200 DAYS PLSSSSSS
200 days 🤨
“it’s not pronounced el-lie-tra” than how tf do you pronounce it?
Luke is saying elytra in Afrikaans
Hi 😅
If anyone is interested, abfielder has a great, incredibly simple iron farm that works very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.
That weaponsmith be different charging more for an iron sword than a diamond sword
You cheated, you got obsidian blocks in your inventory before a diamond pickaxe
He's so good in Minecraft
Dude you can survive anywhere you are insane
That ur mom was funny 😆
me watching this at 7:
200 da§ys?
O M G Luke I'll NEVER be able to do that 100 days on super flat because I have minecraft edu but I did make a monument of you! Also if you're wondering, I'm using my mum's account on youtube because I don't have one :( but I'm ok
But you do pronounce elytra as el-i-tra...
I went to sleep, watching this and I woke up on day 69😂
Luke TheQuoteable
luke can you survive 10000 day in super flat
You’re Minecraft challenges are the best
Can u make Minecraft hardcore murch
I'm doing this challenge in pocket 1.18. no villages and no cobblestone.
I know it's 9 months after, but I would argue that cheating an end portal in Is permissible, simply because how else are you gonna find it?
I just realised that there’s a way to get diamonds in super flat Trade with villagers for diamond armor or tools Smelt the armor or tools for diamond
Did you know: Axes do more damage then swords
Wait you didn’t know they don’t have the end?
Can we have a moment that luke said killing (bad word) i ment witches relatable if your moms watching
2:47 tatakae
If I ever did this challenge I would probably die to a slime in like 15 seconds
what he didn't do that stuff at day 69???
Wait, how are you supposed to pronounce elytra
Fake
Does your video have mods
lmao i like how this dude said they are producing faster than ur mom 😂
I’m questioning if that is real you got six diamonds in a chest but the max is 4 according to google
LukeTheFlatable
hes really notable
10:03 witches: am I a joke to you?
I agree it’s not eleeeeeeetra it’s elytra

In the older version of super flat worlds the nether was flat as well, you could also have end fortresses generate along with mine shafts only thing is they’d generate in the air (I’m not sure if you can do that anymore however)
nah bro, you pronounced it right elytra (el-eye-tra)
Mongolian horse archer!

I've watched this like ten times already but got nothing better to do
On Superflat the never actually used to be fought
I played this on my Xbox and that thing did not have updates on it. Basicly I had minecraft from 2010 (probably  dunno but it was before alot of things) the nether was in fact flat. Rather creepy really and I would have payed for it to be otherwise.
Some netherack that will be good for making potions! - Luke the Notable

You should use a donkey for those loot trips, you can add chests to them for extra storage and I would say that’s quite notable
Day 101: Luke learns of the Mob Sounds audio slider
So this is basically  Wood = sticks = emeralds = diamond armour So. wood = diamond armour
kumbul

there's gravel in the nether dude :/
Fun fact: in the legacy versions of minecraft (ex: minecraft: Xbox one edition) the nether was actually flat
Hey Luke, you should do 100 days in the Starwars mash up.
Can you Make 200 days in super flat
It literally is pronounced elytra. (and no, people at mo-yang pronouncing it el-ee-tra doesn't make it the correct pro-nun-ciation.)
5:24 when my dog sees me eating anything
On the old Xbox one edition you can have strongholds
Hostile Mobs sound slider: Exists  LTN: no
Definitely would love to see more superflat!

He needs to make a 200 days 2nd episode
Binod
F
“Day 20 was a good one, started off by getting some free arrows and killing bi**** on my land”
I like dan robsprobs because he actualy coded it to actually work with the game. I feel like the village is kind of cheating or helping out a bit much as you can just Go to all the villages for all the loot. While dan works to get his villagers with making zombies villagers normal with a potions of weakness and a golden apple.
5:50 best part of the video
Maybe you could do 100 days in a woodland mansion.
I just realized you can get flint in super flat, the nether
Do you spend 100 Irl or in game days?
You could have traded with piglins to get water bottles and fire res potions  If you drank it  You had water bottles
Luke: the weapon smith. ME: do u mean BLACK smith
8:23
The nether is flat on Playstation 3 idition

YASH
Is it true that your dad woks for Minecraft??
You should do a old world style that shrinks everytime you kill something

Anyone else remember the nether being superflat on xbox 360 edition
2:27 Tianamen square massacre but it’s in minecraft
I would love you to go to 200 days this is by far my favorite spin off yet
Your mom jokes like getting very funny
9:22 actually on some of the really old versions of mine craft,the nether was flat. Though, I know this because it was flat on the WiiU version of minecraft so I’m not sure if you really want to try that
Bro I would like to see 200 days this was fun to watch
keep playing

200 days

stardew valley basically
me: slimes are so hard to find!!  luke: OH REALLY!
Hi
Pls make a custom superflat world(Ex. Add stone, deep slate, more dirt, ext.)
Doing this in bedrock is so much harder, though you can make progress. No nether, but through wandering traders and patrols you can get water and trees. Then through oak trees you can gain apples. Then using the water you can drown zombies to gain drowned. Through enough drowned you can get copper. Using several copper you can make a lightning rod. Through a lightning rod you can electrocute pigs gaining pigmen which can drop gold nuggets. Through the gold and the apples you can get a golden apple. Through a golden apple and a witch throwing a splash potion of weakness you should be able to cure a zombie villager. From here you can finally start making a village and really progressing
I can tell why the Alex in the thumbnail is crying because the torch is inside their hand.
i love flat land
hi
Please do more
First person I've ever heard that actually wants a wandering trader xD
DO ANOTHER PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE
In minecraft bedrock Addition the Nether is actually flat
the way he says elytra is just how I say it idk how it makes people mad
"In Java Edition 1.16 and after strongholds do not generate naturally in a default superflat world but in Java Edition 1.15.2 and prior they can, requiring either a world in 1.15.2 to be updated to 1.16 after world creation or a custom superflat preset to generate strongholds naturally while still receiving the features of the Nether Update."   Thats why you couldn't go to The End
Is there 200 days coming
There are fortress chests and zombie pig man for gold
Imagine this on bedrock. All you can do is run around, killing everything
Could you do 200 days pls

Pls for 200 days
Nice thumbnail alex face was nice
Pro tip for super flat survival: Despite the entire world looking the same no matter where you look, this world IS in fact separated by biomes which decides what can and can’t spawn in any given area of super flat. I’ll assume that this is why slimes never spawned inside of the notable slime compound, he just so happened to find a biome that slimes don’t spawn in.
Please make another video of this 🙏
Thats how i met luke the notable
Ah yes slime rancher
make your dad to make dimeinds esey to find i love you

I am wondering who this “Dad” character is would love to meet em some day
Story of my first bastion : It all started on my 1 life 200 days world. I was trying to make a lava acess when a hoglin knocked me down and to keep a long story short I fell in lava and used my only fire potion saving myself which increased my already crazy high fear of the Nether (the reason for this is long story short I died within 10 seconds of my first ever trip to the Nether) and so after getting to day 200 I decided to do smth like LTN's Nether 100 days but only 10 days long cuz I was scared. Anyway on day 4 I was partly mining for gold to trade with piglins and partly tunneling and eventually I dug out into open land and saw a building on the other side of a netherrack field. I was a noob so it took me some googling to figure out it was a Bastion (I knew it was eithera Bastion or a Fortress but I didn't know which) and I had never found one before so I was really excited but I didn't loot it because all I was wearing was a gold helmet and I wanted to get full gold armour before doing it (normally I would get iron with armour with at-least one bit of diamond armour but this was a nether-only challenge so gold would have to do) and went back to get myself some food cuz as well as the bastion I had found some red mushrooms and was able to make some mushroom stew but anyway on day 4 I then went back to the end of the tunnel and just stared at the Bastion for a minute (remember I had never found one before) but then a piglin attacked me and he killed me (in 2 hits) before I could react. I'm not sure why the piglin kiled me. I hadn't mined any gold and was wearing a gold helmet. But since it was a 1 life challenge (I play Bedrock I just mean that if I died I woulden't go back on the world) I'll never know what was in my first Bastion :(
Yes this is how you say elytra
the download is not working
I liked this
Luke should play ark survival I would watch that
The nether used to become flat before the nether update
It always annoyed me that you cant get this gamemode on console
Why is no one taking about how he got a full set of diamond armor
you and do not not 200 days
“Hey hey some netherack” buddy… that’s warts?
Alternative title : surviving only on material I obtained from village...

Where is 200 days on super flat
10:00 Yes, Netherrack.
Woah. He actually became rich in a flat world. What a beast.
Lol. In bedrock version, there's no structures at all.
Been rewatching the same ltn videos over and over because they help me sleep. The super flat, the nether, and so glad I got to add the end video to that so it’s not just the same two.
I tried to play online on someone elses world just now (I play bedrock) and the minute I broke a bit of Sugar Cane everything but me froze cuz the internet connection in my bedroom is 0.0000000000000000002% as bad as Ashwags. I left and tried to rejoin but the guy had stopped playing.
“it’s solid and sturdy unlike your grandma” me who doesn’t have a grandma: 👁👄👁
Wheres 200 days?
Seriously why are all the comments from like now I see none from when this vid was uploaded
if your in creative then you can go into the end by making a portal your self
I have supported 😁😌  I am already subscribed,I liked the video and commented  Now,WE NEED MORE
I pronounce it EH-LIE-TRA and get really annoyed when people call it EH-LI-TRA

Hi
Elytra is pronounced the way you said it
Axes do more damage a wooden axe is as strong as a diamond sword
S l I m E
If you have a PS4 where you bought Minecraft before the village and pillage you can make a flat nether
15:22 you may cringe at me for using slime for this but it's the only block i have unlimited of, man i guess there's dirt but i don't wanna make it out of dirt
LIBRARIANS SELL GLASSS U DUMBO I'm actually surprised u didn't know that.
Luke the notable it’s pronunciation is what you said el.lie.tra that how you pronounce it
If it's not called elytra how is it pronounced?
Imagine somebody building a house a limbs of humans I wouldn’t spawn there
This is too crazy for me. XD

In the old console versions the nether was flat as well. And ocean monuments spawned
5:50 LMAO
2:50 On a server I build an underground base within about a dozen slime chunks in it. Stuff like this is torture for me by now. Especially since I played for about 2 years
Bro this world is flatter than my friend's girlfriend
"they started reproducing faster then your mom" luke the notable me: bet
I like how you called the bastion a blackstone fortress.
Oi
Back then on the 360 edition if you made a super flat world the nether would also be flat. But at the end of the nether was a bedrock wall
If i get 666 likes he should do 200 days
You Just got coconut molled shere this with all you Friends
You said a bad word

Luke should be a comedian
Oh man I am way late watching this but I'd love to see 200 days superflat you could plant a whole forest and name it NoteableHam forest. Like Nottingham but- oh you get it
Yo

I love these unmodded cool challenge 100 day worlds
slime chunks are still a thing in minecraft right? only 1 in 16 chunks will spawn slimes and since the spawining is depth sensitive superflat just sort of amplifies the problem.
Fun fact! The Nether used to be Superflat in Superflat worlds!
8:08
What a notable video
how the heck do you pronounce elytra then? el-ee-tra?
That diamond sword is very notable-Lukethenotable

Luke, I spent over a year calling elytra the way you do, because of your 100 days series, and now you tell me that’s wrong too!?!  Fun fact: I used to call elytra egentla……
It's a Gucci Hooch you should really really really try to bleed as many animals as you can it comes away because I did make a sheep form I didn't kill the sheep because you it is usually there was no mobs in my Ward because of my blood on it twice my brother told her that I'm peaceful so I don't have to deal with creep was always killing my ammo both of them are my sheep from finally done when I'm turning about a castle and a wall a door wall well maybe it's the only way so when I turn off peaceful my animals don't get killed by My pet horse died it was baby horse and I just got it it died by a creeper's blood

Best quote in all the playthroughs- “I think that most of us would.”
DanRobzProbz did this too! But in bedrock edition , where there is no villages. Java players are lucky but i can’t believe he even beat the dragon it, watch it after this notable video! Not before 😡.
Wait- if it was flat would be the nether be flat too?
If you use the "overworld" superflat preset you can have a slime free world
Yooooo

This is impressive
This is impressive

I say elytra like you I like it
Some people think the earth is flat, but it’s not because we would have slime everywhere.
9:27 the nether actually spawns flat in xbox edition, but its just a flat netherrack world with a border too, just that.
Luke saying elytra wrong:I know im saying it wrong im doing it to make people mad Me: who thought that was the right way: wut

His horse was eating the carpet at 26:00
@LukeTheNotable In 1.9 Nintendo Switch Edition You Can Actually Get Flat Nether. But It is useless. 1. No Fortesses  ( No Blases ) 3. NOT EVEN QUARTS CAN SPAWN 4, Endermen Spawns More  - More Chance of Dying but great for speedruns but why would you speed run on a flat world)
If you read this slap a wall

I like how in this one you're fighting your own sanity more than the slimes
Isn't his sheep farm way too complicated, just make them stand on soul sand and make a clock with 2 observers and just have s dispenser with shears (I'm probably being stupid though)
This is pog

I've got two farmers and I want one of them to be a armorer so I removed the villagers job block (composter) and he did become a plain villager with no trades I've tried placing a blast furnace near him but so far he's not changed profession. Any tips or suggestions on why he's not changed yet or how to make him change would be very much  appreciated.
I just calculated how long this would take (100 days of Minecraft). it would take 33 hours and 30 minutes. and about 29 of those hours are full of slime noises. HOW!!!!!! are you ok?

Hey, you don't need to rely on witches for sugar. You can buy a sugar cane from the wandering villager sometimes, though I don't reccomend it as you'd still need witches for bottles. As a third and final method, you could kidnap a witch, as they throw weakness potions. The other potions they throw, poison and harming, heal zombies so there won't be a problem.
why are all the comments so recent
Luke" Day 20 was a good one killing some bitchs kn my land I MEAN WITCH'S Me" I heard a swear

In bedrock edition the nether is also super flat  You spawn in a fortress  And if you mine the walls to get out of the fortress The wall is solid (kinda)
We need tors 😣
Just out of curiosity: do you do Multiplayer with random players?
200 days with tors, superflat, and nether soon.

5:51 that one caught me off guard so bad I've never heard Luke swear
This was the very first video I saw from this dude, and damn is he cool
on day 15 his shovel healed itself
Will did you know that I remember in the older versions on the bedrock Minecraft it had only 2 layers of dirt?
hOW
Slimes spawn in slime chunks at any time from about Y layer 12 or so down since your on Y layer 4 on super flat any slime chunk will spawn slimes and slime chunks are common so he just based in a area that wasn’t a slime chunk also good video
Just saying he could have done this on bedrock maybe slimes don’t spawn in bedrock.
👁👄👁
13:47 at least i have a mom
Nice
Ltn there is a way to craft end portal framed apparently I ttied in bedrock edition and it didnt work
This is a really good tip. When your anvil is on low health, break it and place it again. You will thank me later😉

You don't deserve 3 million subscribers you deserve 20 million subscribers
You could just make a base from dirt with no windows or doors, and just do nothing for the 100 days, u jelly?
Luke you passed up the rarest banner design in the game at least I think it is it’s called snout
Hey Luke can you make 200 in superflat?
Luke, IT IS PRONOUNCED E-LY-TRA
So, in older builds of the game (i.e.- back when you used to customize the blocks of the Superflat and Console), the fortress could still spawn, but it was very unlikely and was connected to having structures generate.
11:34 that is how you pronounce it lol
I can't wait for 3000 days
Dude, 8 blocks between your water sources for you farm, not 4. much better:)
How is this so entertaining?
Slime noises chain???
Day 100-200 would be great!

Luke's treating the slimes like chinese citizens lol
Remeber when stampy did this?

You could get the water from a farm in a village then go to the blacksmith and put water on the lava to make obsidian. To mine it you need to get lucky from a blacksmith. Then you can go to the nether then end with a cleric to trade ender pearls. Then you beat the game like so he can see lol
Why is everyone watching this like 10mins ago

Idk why but for some reason the base comment sorting is by recent
If people are confused about why the comments are so recent, it’s because the comment section is sorted by recent
Wait the comments are so recent ?
Surviving 300 days in only fortress

Reee
luke:  the blackstone fortesses  the comment section:bro its a bastion hey u r a dumb u r a noob of minecraft bla bla bla
As you can see he is sus cause at some moments at the last he has a lodestone compass which you can recognise by the enchanted glint which needs a lodestone which is crafted using 1 netherite ingot in the middle and he doesn't use it for any tools or shows mining ancient debri and if I am right the villagers don't trade netherite ingots 🧐 Pretty suuuuuuuuuus

Damn I didn’t know that villages spawned in flat worlds
Is it just me or did Luke turn not so village friendly
bro convert map in vidio to mcpe/bedrock edition
If everyone is wondering why all the comments are super recent, it’s because  the default for comment section has most popular at the top, whilst Luke has it set so the newest are at the top

CHALLENGE: Try surviving this WITHOUT Structures for 1000 days! Making it a true SUPER-flat world! All you get is a bonus chest with 1 lvl3 locator map, 4 torches, and 1 oak sapling, 1 lava source spawning nearby, and 1 sugarcane! I managed to get all Iron necessities, A lake, Stacks of Iron, Copper, and Gold blocks, A villager Breeder (Witches sometimes drop potions), etc... making what you did seem a little bit small, however, I wasn't able to do it in hardcore.
19:10 Bullseye 🎯
We need more it's to evdicing and then there's not another more plssssss
I don't have a gramma already
You should do a 200 day and make a memorial for your horse

If I had a nickel for every youtuber I'd watch narrating paint drying on a bench I would have 2 which is weird cos it has happened twice and yes this does include LukeTheNotable
You can get black dye from wither roses which you can get by haveing a wither kL other mobs
Guys immediately when you open the comment section it puts you on "newest first" so tap/click the filter button and tap/click "top comments"
11:38 it sounded right to me?
I miss when you had superflat neather
When I try to make a super flat it puts me in creative and if I go to survival it goes to infinite world and no villages spawn does anyone know what’s happening
Only real Minecraft veterans remember when superflat worlds made the nether superflat too.
Smooter!
How is everyone commenting just now? Totally not me :^
why did everyone decide to watch this again today i just watched it for the third time just found it again
"...it's solid and sturdying unlike your grandma."
Comment = fresh
I have the custom superflat mode i can activate lava pools add blicks that will be under the 3 layer dirt tree spawning strongholds viliges ravines etc (ruined portals to) except for caves and mountains cuz this place is flat. Still the wierdest thing was that. The stronghold spawned on land
why r these comments so fresh wtf
wait that isn’t how you pronounce elytra?
ive been killing slimes for 100 days and making dirt tunnel episode 1
Wait wait wait wait… THATS NOT HOW YOUBSAY ELYTRA
26:08  yeh dude its silent but chill  like seriously
Does anyone notice that he makes almost all of his 100 days videos exactly 30 minutes long?
please make a 100 days (minecraft skyblock on hypixel)
Did we all decide to watch this just now??? Lol
Goodnight Stranger  Have a good day tommrow :) <3
So how are you supposed to pronounce elytra???
why on earth are the comments so new  including the ones which are complaining the same thing
how tf are all popular comments new
why are the comments so fresh
Why the comments so new
Day 21 he had Diamond Armour and stone Axe 😁
Me, a minecraft pocket edition player: *sad completely flat world noises*
Y'know a superflat nether used to exist, it was back when minecraft worlds weren't even infinite
Why is everyone watching this
I’ve actually done this before... a long time ago...
Elytra IS pronounced “Eli-tra.” If you pronounce it differently you’re gay
2:48 *shoe*
You know it's torture if the thumbnail has tears in it
Why are there so many new comments?
Minecraft PE players doing this: …
what about 100 days floating islands?
11:32 that's not how you pronounce it?
This video is popping off, exactly right now
Do any of you remember minecraft's PS4 version of minecrafts Flat World Nether? it was the nether, but well completely flat bedrock lol
wait its not pronounced elytra?
My name is Luke as well
you can get gravel in the nether just saying ok daddy
The barbarous silver intrestingly file because advantage probably plug sans a succinct quarter. cautious, outstanding hockey
Just saying, xbox 360 super flat is the best version of super flat. You could add or remove layers. Have caves with ore veins, ravines, mob spawners, lakes and lava lakes, mineshafts and strongholds! it was a completely customisable superflat.
Day 10,000 of hardcore superflat: Luke successfully raises the world by one block.
Definitely COUNTIUE the series PLEASSSEEE
Anti pickup line:   "Girl, is your chest Java edition, because it's superflat."  I mean, unless she likes Minecraft, then...
wow we all got recommended this lol
does anyone else get triggred by him calling it a blackstone fortress when its a BASTION
Actually, "Elytra" IS pronounced "ell-eye-trah". Those who pronounce it "el-eee-tra" are weird
Ok
this guy could narrate the paint on a bench drying and I'd watch that shit religiously
THANKS FOR RUINING YOUR OWN CHANEL
Last time I played in a flat mode and goes to the nether, it was flat.
The nether isn’t flat… My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
The algorithim has made all the children come together. how nice
Wait how he turn the villegers into  different types
Whats kind of funny about the flat nether in the old console versions the nether was flat
I’m on Java but I can never find a village on super flat
How do u spawn in villages
I liek slime ball ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
3:10 lol
Luke the notable Has full diamond armor Has a house made of slime and no roof
200 days Superflat pleassssssse
I want another vid of this
Hmmm everyone is talking about a video that was made in the span of 4 months this really brings the true society
everyones coming back to this video to binge after watching the end video

Not so family friendly like the notobale
4:27 I think that's called prostitution....
You should make a 1000 for all besides creative
Dudeee, everyone just comment now lmao XD
Wow you are evil 😕
He could’ve used the bones from the nether
Bro strongholds dont spawn on 1.16 superflat worlds

Og this is pretty cool!
you dont sleep for 100 days?
Would love to see 200, I found this super interesting and was also an eye opener about how much can be done on a superflat world. I always thought superflat was just for building in creative.
Luke: slime is the only block I have unlimited Wood and Cobble: *Are you sure about that?*
ltn: 100 daYS!! world types: ok guys who was it this time?
Though this was interesting, and you accomplished quite a lot, I don't really know what you might do for 200 days. I'd still like to see you do it!
RIP HORSE
fix the download for this please
WE NEED 200 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(also I reatched all the 100 days series due to ****ing covid
Luke ur a genius man 🤣🤣 love your videos
did he call netherwart nether rack?
Wait...its not pronounced Ee-LIE-truh?
Why is everyone just finding  out about this vid
What is the sees
10:00  "Hey hey! Some Netherrack! That'll be nice for making potions!"
me seeing this thumbnail and the title: come on now this is impossible!   Luke: YEAH! NETHERITE ARMOR!44!!!44!!!4!!4!!!!
"So I spent the night clubbing some of the babies" -Luke TheNotable 2021
Why the hell is there so many recent comments? I felt early on a video for once because of it.
you should have a patreon page so you if need could get new recording software and audio stuff if yours ended up breaking and it would be a smart idea cuz instead of asking people just to sub and like you could also ask them to fund it
8:00 :) don't worry friend
Is this only on Java?
lmao why are all the views so recent when it was posted 4 months ago
26:07 me when a 7 yr old says minecrafts bad
continue
Am I the only one who realized that he didn’t choose the overworks preset which has strongholds and other useful things
commenting cuz he told me too lol
me also being a philza fan: *baby zombies appear* me: *visible fear*
Who watched his Minecraft videos and is now can’t stop watching them
Where did the comments go???
Is it just me or before I saw the channel I thought it was Luke DaNotble
Part 2
I tried this, but died after 5 days...
I haven't cared about minecraft for a while, but your challenge videos have inspired me!! Idk why but I love your 100 day videos :)
8:22 BLEAHHHH
NEW SERIES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
For the extreme challenge try this on bedrock edition!
“Get on down here sheep number 7... or 8...”  *falls asleep*
Delicious deep fried footage

ENDER CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESEEEEEEEEE
LukeTheNotable: Everywhere I go, I see his face. Slime Face Appears
I watched your channel before you even had 300k I was 7 years old...
Give us 200 Days Superflat!!!!
its a shame this format is dying :(
When will you come out with 200 days 😢
Swear 5:50
lmao he cursed 5.50
What I imagine his response would be   Me: why Luke why do u go through this pain?    Luke : *content*
11:33 wait elytra /isn't/ pronounced like that?? like legit I'm confused :1
Pls do 200 u could try to get netherite armor
Go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why was his compass enchanted
Just me over here wondering why he was using a bad farming method. 1 water block (running or source) can wet (dont know the real world) 4 blocks in each direction, aka you can farm 32 blocks  using 2 1x1 water blocks 8 blocks apart
I love you pls do more videos❤️
The symptomatic rhythm preclinically long because bagel unlikely heat near a threatening song. blue, abandoned swim
Cringe
if you are in pre-bedrock console editions, the nether is actually superflat
I mostly choose a house from a Village and make it my base
In java Minecraft the wooden axe does 7 hearts of damage and the Swordsman only 4 hearts
5:50 LOL
And How did you know the big Boys do 3 hearts?
I also played Minecraft super flat in hardcore
Good work, SUPER entertaining keep up the hard work
I'd love to see more of this! The narration of what you do makes it funny to me BAHAHA
Believe it or not back on legacy console edition there was a superflat nether. It was funky. Wither skeletons spawn naturally wothout nether brick. Its kinda weird
Love it
Me watching: how is there, a village i didnt knowe villages could spawn 😱
me who do mining in ravine and there's a lot of slime spawning too: I feel ur pain
WHY. DO YOU. MAKE ALL YOUR VIDEOS. 30 MINUTES. AND *1* SECCOND. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I love how you talk like Hunter S. Thompson
Do series super flat
Hey you have lava in nether so you can do separate cobblestone farm and trash
i thought superflat was only a bedrock edition option
H-he HE SWORE
Yo my dude savage bruh
Wait a second have I been lied to... 11:32
Yay
People: the Earth is flat Me: Show me proof The proof:

5:50 did you say b***ces?
I can't believe I just watch him surviving at flat world until day 82.
My name is William!!

Yo
Usually if I do survival I only do a couple of days and I probably get killed by a slime
“They started reproducing faster than your mom”  -LTN 2021
His voice is amazing,it's so refreshing
Probably my favourite video
plot twist his dad is a janitor
I tried to do this but I couldn’t because the gosh darn SLIMES(me pc almost blew up lol)
U can use the village wood too build the 🏠
Not killing the golems yourself is good for cheaper trades with villagers
Just like my gf
It’s like watching a mincraft version of The Martian
I remember when I used to play in my sister’s Super flat world in MC. The one on the CD. We were allowed to customise the blocks under us. For examples, we could make layers that could go from different types of oak logs to diamond blocks. It was cheating but was incredibly fun. Sadly, there’s something wrong with the CD. I think I’ll load the world again when I can.
Let's take a moment to appreciate that the video is exactly 30 minutes long...
The way you are trying to keep slimes outside of the walls kinda reminds me of attack on titans lol
ngl I saw 100 days in the nether and was like that's pretty cool but this definitely gained a sub bro good job😂😂😂
Is nobody gonna talk how he even got the enchanted compass on day 91-100?  Edit: oh it's a curse of vanishing that's why...
This is the fakest video I’ve ever seen That amount of diamonds in a chest is impossible
the. sheer. dedication.
The ancient sphynx inspiringly yawn because gazelle corroboratively license unlike a mountainous retailer. ignorant, screeching attempt
they used to have flat nether worlds i thought
For a iron farm or any mob farm set entity distance 300 or more
only Hardcore
10:00 did he just say nether rack? That’s nether wart
(:
that was a good video
Continue
I really want to make a super flat and survive on it but the thing is I play on bedrock edition so there’s no villages if you know how to get villages on a superflat world on bedrock edition please tell me how in the
When I started a super flat world there wasn’t a single slime probably because I was playing on bedrock
4th Time Watching These      Help Me….
Spam pog lol
Lol I did this but I didn’t do it in hardcore bc I’m bad at the game and I’m glad I just left in plain survival
You are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i like you
wow is so cool man
🤘🏻💜🟩

Alternate title: hating slimes for 100 days in hardcore
What did you say?              5:49

100 days in Hypixel skyblock would be really interesting to me
Can you do a 200 daysin superflat?
Big fan ltn
I played minecraft long time ago I steel play it i play this on phone what do you play  on computer?
hi
i lovw how he said neather rack instead of neather wart
The older editions of Minecraft had superflat Nether spawns, but that was before the Nether updates when Zombie Pigmen were still a thing...
Fun fact: legacy console edition minecraft's superflat also included a superflat nether.  Downside: limited world size and no 1.16 update. Upside: b e d r o c k w a l l
we need netherite
There is no end portal in flat
Luke turned into donald trump in this video
There's no letter in a flat world I know that's what you're supposed to know that all
Pls I want a second
Just like tors huh?
TVT
You get we gave you lots of likes to help-for your pain
26:07 nothing but SILENCE XD
Please stop trying to basically put people’s channels in great danger by trademarking this title. Other YouTubers want to have fun by playing this 100 days, and then sharing their experience with other people on the internet. This is growing your trend Luke. You should stop not caring about other peoples channels, and focus on having fun.
wait it’s not pronounced eh-lie-tra?
Agga
You can try to see if you can trade for stronghold blocks.
The slimes are a pain. You’re lucky the smaller ones are harmless nor do they count as monsters.
Do it do morrrrrs please
I seem to be seeing lots of hate I think there just jealous of Luke like look at the effort he puts into these
;
i wish that Mojang could make you can put an elytra on your chestplate just go into the crafting table just put the chestplate and they elytra and boom elytra on chestplate
There's no such thing as a black stone in the Fortress it's called and Bastien
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE END DOES NOT SPAWN IN SUPERFLAT
netherack? u mean wart 10:00

Use bone meal to make grass and slime can't spawn on grass so it will be slime free
i love this series so much, so so interesting :)
Luke I don't have a minecraft
In the original PS4 edition of Minecraft the Nether was flat in a superflat world
He should’ve gotten fortune 3 on their pickaxe for better farming drops. His loss.
whoever said luke cheated on day 81 obviously doesnt know that you cant use cheats on hardcore.
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Plz more super flat
Who’s gonna tell him you can just turn down mob sounds in settings so you don’t have to listen to the slimes
What was the part he said b*tches? I can’t stop laughing at it but I don’t remember what day it was.
13:47 thats gotta be real fast then
Luke is the Nether was flat no lava :D but no stucksures
You should make a modes super flat
Still waiting for 200 days :((
2:23 China government
how to survive in super flat for 100 days: step 1 - dig down 3 blocks step 2 - put one of the blocks on top of you step 3 - wait without moving so your hunger bar won't go down step 4 - profit

You should build a momument to the iron golems you killed, my idea would be to build one final pillar and place an armor stand on top with an axe in its hand. Id recommend building it in the center of the village where the breeder is at.
Imagine if you did a 200 days that would be boring

This dude speedruns talking
WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB WEEB
slimes are super common in super flat because 1 out of 10 chunks are a slime chunk and in slime chunks slimes can spawn below y level 40 regardless light levels and since slimes are the only mobs that can spawn during the day they will spawn extremely frequently inside of the slime chunks and them moving around making it seem like they spawn everywhere. you can look at the exact boundaries of each chunk by pressing F3+G once you’ve identified which chunks around your area are slime chunks you’ve got 2 ways of dealing with the slimes that i can think of the first of which would be making a fence around each slime chunk keeping the slimes contained to only slime chunks or placing slabs over the entire slime chunk which would completely stop slimes from spawning.
100 Days in a slime field lol
You should try 100 by 100

I remember when super flat world nethers were flat. It was horrible, there was nothing
What the
wait at 11:33 its not pronounced like that have i really been saying it wrong the whole time
fun fact: th reason so many slimes spawn in superflat is that the way slimes spawn is that they spawn in any slime chunk below y=30, no mater the light level, therefore, they spawn during the day, and as the only hostile mob spawning during the day, they have the whole hostile mob cap to themselves.

For killing iron golems, if you build the pilliar 2 blocks higher, place a trapdoor, then delete the block under the trapdoor, you can close the trapdoor on yourself to be able to kill the iron golem without very much risk (unless you get shot off by a skeleton or fall off on accident)

3 goals for 200 days in superflat  1. To get full netherite armor and tools         While you're at it, get the absolute best enchants on your armor and tools  2. To make a full beacon, made of emeralds, iron, and gold  3. Just to prove yourself once again, defeat the wither for the 2nd time.                   But that's boring, so do it with a raid at the same time  These are all really difficulty but I think you can do it, my friend!
Me: day 1-99 this is funny  Day 100: why have I wasted so much time
13+ years why im sad
am i the only person who actually thought that its called el I tra and not e lee tra
Luke on day 28-ish: “Natural diamonds on a superflat world, this is huge, I can do so much now, HuUuAaAh!”

I always wondered why he can keep track of the days so easily; there's a debug screen on Java edition which shows how many days have passed. I've been playing on Bedrock for the past ever and it doesn't have that debug screen, or at least I don't think so. Now that I have Java, I always play with that debug screen up, for some reason...
This was soooooo much more entertaining than I expected :D

How come most of the newest comments are of just random stuff that makes no sense and has absolutely nothing to do with the video? Edit: I've also realized that most of the comments that I see are from 3 days ago all the way to 30 minutes ago
Where’s the 200 fucking days Luke
Came here thinking I was just gonna watch a bit and leave since it was 30 minutes. I'm writing this at 24 minutes in. How did you distract me from time?
I have an idea for you to get a glass bottle. So first, you kill some spiders to get string, get a few sticks, make a fishing pole, make a lil pond, and wait till you get a glass bottle! It's very easy!
I love how everyone just decides to watch this today
This guy is pretty notable
the dimond chest
200days
For a block of farmland to be wet, it needs to be within 4 blocks of water, not touching it. The farms in villages and the kind you made are really not the best, you can use the same amount of water and have way more arable pieces of land if you stop letting the water flow and replace it with dirt. Each block of water should be have 8 blocks in between them.
Cool

If you go to 200 days and get netherite, being full netherite on hardcore super flat would be the ultimate flex
You can get the strong hold if you dont edit the layers it just spawns over the ground and you can throw eyes if you go far enough in one direction you'll probably find one but if you make the world thick it spawns under the ground
you can actually go to the end in a super flat world, though you have to travel a lot in a random direction and you should find a stronghold, eventually. this can take days, and days though (even of real life time) and also in some directions there might not be a stronghold

Do it in the overworld flat preset
Before 1.16 it was super flat nether (well it was on WiiU
What about Nether Superflat. Doesn't seem impossible. I can understand if that isn't a thing yet, but if lukethenotable could start the 100 days era, then he could start the nether super flat era. Also Tors 200 days!!!!!

“No slimes sorry you can’t have any you *don’t have rights.* -Luke
it was a very sad day irl but a good day on yt (not 5/17/2021 but when it was released)
I guess they changed the super flat, because the nether used to just be netherrack forever
I wrote a comment
So anyone wondering the reason slimes are spawning is because the world of course consists of chunks and some chunks Called slime chunks so in superflat since it's well flat the slimes from slime chunks will only spawn on the grass on top hence why there are so many slimes
200 days
Fun fact: A superflat nether actually does exist. I don't know how hard it is to visit one nowadays, but my sister still has an out-of-date Xbox 360, which I can use to visit superflat nethers.
3:02 he said the thing
My first death in minecraft was a lama
Pls continue this series
Sad that the structures are only in Java. (I have bedrock :( )

5:24 “slimes don’t have rights” -Luke The Notable
little late I know, but for farming you can make a 9x9 with a one-block hole for the water, due to the water being able to work up to 4 block past the water source, this is more efficient then the current way I've noticed you make your farms
Hold on wait they are all recent! How did we get here? ;)
5:53 Luke: b*tches Me: hmmmm true
Wait untill he finds out you can turn down monster sounds.

Hello everyone,  I love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with all my heart and I want to tell you about him. We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ’s blood washes away all of our sins. Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works.   None of us know when we will die. Accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and getting saved allows us to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!  A couple of resources:   Check out "How to Get Saved" and "The Gospel" by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out "How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer" by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.    Some verses from the King James Version Bible:  Romans 3:23  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;    2 Corinthians 7:10  10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.    1 Corinthians 15:1-4  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:    Romans 10:9-10  9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.   Acts 16:30-31  30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   Ephesians 2:8-9  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation. Thank you for your time.

Petition for Luke to do 100 days on either Bedrock edition or Pocket Edition.
10:01 Some nether rack hmmmmmmmmmm I thought it was a block not a item to brew potions
I'm not sure if it was just a legacy edition thing, but I know for a fact that superflat nether worlds used to be a thing... I kinda miss them, but I can see why they aren't around now.

Alright that’s amazing how someone could do a 100 days granted that’s like an hour of in game time idk anyway but not having all the resources other than villages and fighting the wither out of pure curiosity is mind blowing to me also 30 mins flat appreciated not planned but it’s satisfying would love to see 200 and 300 but still waiting on 3000 for hardcore just interested in what you’d do tbh

It’s crazy that this wasn’t even possible before 1.14.
Would you rather have slime or creepers
Make one more wall around your house and it looks like attack on titan 🤣

Luke I’m extremely dissapointed on you you messaged people especially big you tubers on there Sieries of 100 days when they gave credit to you if you didn’t know calvins sieries was before yours he started doing rlcraft before you so you can’t be mad
elytra isn't pronounced like that?
To get stronghold in minecraft superflat make a superflat world in 1.15 and upgrade to 1.16 so it will spawn with stronghold
How do you make pumpkin pie in Minecraft?
Luke: Get out of the bed timmy, or I'll kill your parents.  Me, named Timmy watching this video at night: ...MOMM
"Uh it's so TRANSPARENT" I choked on my Pepsi 🖐💀
I have legit been here sense 100 days you have came a long way Luke
Blast Protection would be better for the wither, the wither deal explosive damage, so at least has one armor with blast protection will help a lot.
Like the notable and subscribe
its a basion not a blackstone fortress
5:51 LMAO
Where is 3000 days! I was looking forward to it. Thanks this is good to through.

Maybe you, forge labs, fixxitt 412, Adriens, RyannotBrian, ButterJaffa, iceeman, OhTekkers, and your wife (sorry I am not good with names I had to go back and look at then others names over and over) can make a modded survival hardcore 100 days like mixing the parasite, zombie apocalypse, bleach anime mod, SCP mod, creepypasta mod, Jurassic mod, and industrial revolution I hope you like my idea
It was. Nether was flat without aby fortresses
19:55 you can put golden armor and tools in a furnace to make gold nuggets but the process would be very slow.

Hope 200 days gets made
lets respect that this video is exactly 30 minutes long and he has included time stamps
Is I just me that no matter which video I watch from this channel is entertaining
When farming, although water can soak up to four blocks ahead of it, you shouldn’t count just to four. Count to eight, because the new water can soak the missing four blocks, saving you shovel durability and time. Also, if you craft leads, you can tow a boat across land, and since villagers can’t be towed with leads, it’s very useful for getting villagers back to base fast.
There is flint, u can go the nether with o I from villages and get gravel XD
Witches luke, witches.
why nobody ever uses the piglin-trade - you get tons of obsidian, iron,...

To be honest just the fact this video exists proves its possible before you watch a single second of it. And I think I'm just watching to see how ridiculous the builds get.

Okay I don't want to be a bummer here but I think it was like a synchronicity when the footage got corrupted...  You could say it got withered..  Literally the actual wither corrupted the footage.

A comment
The chubby lily genotypically develop because judge fundamentally camp on a mushy pain. bright, fluttering clam
Using world generation tools or structure code, you can actually make mineshafts and strongholds spawn in a superflat world. They'll just generate in the sky instead of in the ground. So, really you don't even need your eyes of ender to find it. You might need one just to get the general direction of it at first, but you can also just wander into it. Mineshafts also have some pretty nice loot like more diamonds, gapples, enchanted books, and other crop seeds.
my fav video
It irritates me how little he uses a shield
You where doing hardcore
10:00 ah yes netherrack the best ingredient to make potions
03:10 “get out of the bed timmy or il kill your parents”

Slime rancher in minecraft
the nether was superflat on legacy console version superflat worlds, (ps3, xbox 360, wii u, old switch, old xbone, old ps4, 3ds, vita)
Mojang REALLY needs to change how slime spawning works, this next update would be a good opportunity for that. Maybe they could add slime caves or something to replace the old god-awful slime chunk system.
The squalid protocol atypically explode because game seemingly retire after a wrathful climb. smoggy, careless jasmine
This is epic

I may only be on the first 25 days by this comment but you can get obsidian from blacksmiths and flint&steel from them too so you could technically beat a boss

"Get out of the way Timmy or I'll kill your parents"- LuketheNotable  2020
I wonder what Renault hes fixing up. Id say Renault is a mixed bag when it comes to cars. They have this strange thing they and all almost all french car manufacturers do where they create repulsive looking cars and probably expect it to be considerd art. That snoppyness is what caused me at least to never think much of french manufacturers.

This is the least boring video I've ever seen in my entire existence
Little advice if you do this: use a slimeball plus a piece of string to make a leash, then you can kidnap two villagers at once by putting them both in the boat and leashing the boat. Plus, while you still have to move slowly so as to not have the leash pop off, it's still faster than trying to swim in a boat on land.

Can you do dropping salty towers 100 times? (Like so Luke can see)
Wait ... Walls ? Giant monsters from behind the walls ? Swearing to kill all these monsters even though it seems impossible ?  ... Am I watching attack on Slime ?
*New challenge idea:*   When generating a world, select the Caves option and select a biome preset of your choice and try to survive.   Oh yeah, since trees don't spawn in the caves themselves (atleast not during my testing), but rather on top of the entire world, getting wood might prove difficult, to not say impossible cause the top is made of Bedrock, but I believe you can edit presets and I'll allow you to remove the bedrock layer if you attempt to do this. Other structures such as temples also spawn ontop of the world.  But I think you can manage living in a place filled with hostile mobs 24/7 and no light, other than lava and ambient light. You are Luke TheNotable after all.  Like if you think he should do this, I'd love to see it.
Toes 200 days
pls make a part 2 to this video i really enjoyed this video and have watched it several times.
ok
slimes exist luke: and i took that personally

Luke you should make an 100 days in unturned it's a zombie survival game that's free on steam its pretty fun.
Do a I got Max mando in one day      Please
I need more of this series
There's this video about how "Luke TheNotable's too egotistical!", but I've only seen a couple videos of his MineCraft stuff. What's egotistical about pushing your limits in MineCraft? Sure, he's asking others to give it a try, but he's not mocking them or anything like "HA HA! I'm SOOO much better than you, you can't POSSIBLY do better than me in MineCraft!" Like, hello? I'm still playing on easy and normal in MineCraft, I don't want to try this HardCore difficulty, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't watch Luke's videos. If you ask me, I think Luke's an amazing MineCraft player, who went above and beyond to give himself challenges to overcome in the game! But it's nice to hear that Luke's a decent and nice guy.  Also, what about trying the Super Mario World mod for MineCraft, if you have the Nintendo Switch I mean!
In 3000 days u should make a prison, with EVERY single mob.
hey luke if you want id be great if you could make 100 days in hypixel skyblock :)

Luke thenotable 2021 11:30
Spawns don't spawn inside the walls of Fort Slime because underground slime spawns are tied to specific chunks, selected at random, if I recall. So the village had a slime chunk in it thus slimes would spawn there, but you picked a place in between that didn't intersect any slime chunks, and thus no slimes there.
Pls do 200 days and 1000

3For YHWH so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:  I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one  jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,  and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of  heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be  called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew Chap 5  Jesus loves you very much, sometimes it may not seem like it, but He never left you aside, He knows absolutely everything that happens in your life, your moments of sadness and joy. He is the water of life, if you drink this water you will never be thirsty and nothing else will plague you, even if you go through difficult situations. If you still don't believe in Him, say a simple prayer asking Him to confirm that He exists and He will show you. He has a great desire to have a closer relationship with you.

Huh. At first, I always considered Super Flat world to be very boring, considering that all it has is slimes, dirt, and villages, with no underground caves nor other underground goodies. The game is called "MINEcraft" for a reason... Seeing this video amazed me! I underestimated the power of villagers! From now on, super flat world should officially be named "The Diplomat Simulator!"
A

Isn’t this the guy that copyrighted the “100 days” thing?
Wait. You can change the villagers? How? And can it be done on Switch version? Sheep duplication too? Dang. PC version is pretty awesome.
This dude makes more progress on a flat world than what I can do in a normal world.
Loving it so far keep it up!
You can get glass bottles from witches on flat version. Take awhile though.
I watch unbreakable sometime to but mostly you but also unspeakable and other YouTubers but Luke the notable the best YouTuber I love you very very much I want you like only like on Friday but I also do it another day but I love you and I watch you on YouTube tomorrow
Nether wasn't superflat?? Thats a change I never noticed.

I’d love to see a series
HE SAID BAD WORD 11!1!!! BEN HIM
*"a thousand slimes protested my new wall, so i killed them"* *you cant deny he impersonated trump*
22:51 Actually, my grandma is 71 years old and she is quite healthy and does not need a wheelchair or anything like that
You could have smelted the armor for iron I think
How most people see Minecraft: Survival in the wilderness. How Luke the notable sees it: Stocks and business

From stripper ing for 69 years I have 69 times more xp than him
Why does he make his farm like that?
You should do this but with caves only in the newest snapshot or 1.17 whenever it comes out.
The pathetic umbrella resultspreviously hate because icicle invariably question as a cluttered apparatus. aboriginal, upset dungeon
"hey look some netherrack that will be useful for making potions and stuff "10:00
Are we not gonna talk about how he had a lodestone in his basement which takes a netherite ingot to make ?
He cheated there was no water and he never got any achievements.

What your Fortnite videos had taught me was this. “You don’t have to be the best to say you did it, there is no testimony to someone else’s test.”
Please put wool under the walls, it was all I could think about after watching this. Hoping for 200
uggh
Profits XD
Sorted by "Newest First," so hello
"its so nice to hear nothing but SILENCE!"        as he yells it lol
Stop building trenches for the water, one water block can hydrate farm land up to four blocks away in all directions! So you only need to have water blocks separated by 8 blocks in each direction.
Hard choice 3000 days or 200 on super flat 🤔
gotta be his most unmotivated vid yet
Profits
Yeah the world is superflat like Alex chest
slimes and golems oh its you maby we could this behind us... you monster.
There is a way to go to the end, you will need a nether portal ( I advise to make a new one) and get a book, a feather and a black inc (if you make a 2 by 2 water source and use a fishing rod with luck of the sea, so you can fish a squid or the inc) and make a book and quill, write “abatised redivides” and throw in the portal
Wait, its not pronounced ei-light-trah? How do you say it then
The 11k dislikes are from all the golems and slimes killed
super fun series please continue
You should've put one more wall and named them Maria Rose and Sina, Attack On Slimes
The little quit oddly destroy because oval unequivocally agree onto a  five branch. draconian, gleaming arm
Fizzy banger is taking about you should be stopped  please respond please   Luke the notable

You don't have rights."  "*picking up Netherwarts* Hey, some netherrack."  "It's so nice to hear nothing but SILENCE!"  Love the series; keep it up!

Wow. Excited for 200 days!
5k days will take 1 year to record so 3 years to edit and record
Now do it with structures turned off. I tried it once and you basically just need to kill zombies until you get enough iron for a cauldron, then enough for a bucket, then you go on with it. Super hard and fun challenge.
The false familiar famous option sequentially owe because dance basally harass behind a outstanding tornado. smoggy, second road
Hey at least you can make a ton of leads

LukeTheProfitable
I know this isn't part of the rules but the only way to get to the end on a superflat is with cheats, so if you can then you should cheat ONCE to build a end portal (if you know how) its fair and square.

Minecraft used to have a flat nether in flat world's before the nether update or at least in the 4j console versions
Ÿēß
Wait... How are you supposed to pronounce Elytra???
How did you got water
hearing luke say "bitches" sounds so abnormal
Did more in super flat then I would in a normal world
WTF!!!!!!! THE VILLAGERS TRADING A DIAMOND ARMOR

Neither used to be flat before the neither update

*Me wondering why the comments are from the last 5 minutes....*
The complete mouth nutritionally print because loaf arthroscopically earn within a busy bus. afraid, smiling celsius
anyone notice the mistake at 10:00
Imagine having the "Cover me with diamonds" before the "Diamonds" Achievement-
Minecraft has blocks in it.
What if he died on day 99
Clubbing baby's huh?
Did any1 else get triggered when he called nether wart, netherrack? Other then that this was AWSOME! :D
He could have used the red wood from the nether and it would have looked better. Red wood and black stone.
doing my part, comment every minute!
I’d like to see a 20l but there’s probably not enough to do in 1,000 considering you only get one type of wood for building and there’s no end
is ther a comment a minute
Yo start with the 1000 days again lol I love them
Never seen any of your videos before but now I’m hooked
please do more luke
Everyone’s comments are new wtf?

Get in the boat.
You can get bottles by trading with pilagers They give Fire Res and then you can use those bottles!!
You achieved more on a flat hardcore world than I ever did in a normal average world.
TLDR: Some people are mistakenly saying weapon-smiths can only have 3 diamonds max. Diamonds do only appear on the loot table in groups of 1-3 but they can get “rolled” on that table multiple times in a single chest. So it’s possible to get 6 or even theoretically 24.  Full explanation: Some people have left comments along the lines of “Luke must have cheated since he found 6 diamonds and only 3 can spawn.” And while a quick glance at the Minecraft wiki says there’s a 16.2% chance of finding 1-3 diamonds, that’s a bit misleading.   See the Minecraft loot table for weaponsmiths has 94 entries in it and each item on the list takes up a certain number of entries, more entries means when the rng picks a number 1-94 there’s a better chance of it landing on that item. For example there’s a weight of 15/94 for a single apple to appear. Diamonds are 5/94 for 1-3 diamonds to appear.  The reason this is kind of important is because the game will pick from this list of 94 anywhere from 3 to 8 times. That’s why it’s possible to find multiple apples in a chest even though it only lists “one apple” as the loot option. It just rolled one apple multiple times.   So even though the Minecraft wiki says diamonds spawn in chests in numbers from 1-3, you just need 2 or 3 of those to happen in the 3-8 loot rolls each chest has. The odds for it to happen are kind of low but they’re honestly not the worst.
why are these comments recent lmao
We need 200 days tomorrow
I'm sorry to say LTN but the stronghold doesn't spawn in 1.16 superflats but they do spawn in 1.14 superflats
11:33 says who?
So this just comes up on your explore section on feb 25th?
26:00 the horse tho😂
Didn’t know there could be up to 6 diamonds in a blacksmith chest, I’ve only found up to 3

Please keep doing this its a change of pace for normal play throughs

Sorry it was acsident
cant wait for 200 days :)
luke i gotta call you out for those six diamonds that you found in that chest ( 8:30 ) uhhh you can only get up to three diamonds in a single weaponsmith chest so you could not get those six diamonds the chance for getting one diamond is at like 16 % and getting three must be lik a 1% chance sooooo I think your ling to me chief sorry but I gotta call you out man you just can't get that past me this is still a good vid but why you cheat man
I found Luke theNotable through Forge Labs and I honestly enjoyed this video very much.
"Gotta out it back to 69"                 N i c e ;)
Wait how are you supposed to say elytra?
nice i really enjoyed this :D
This is probably the most intense 100 days you've done Luke!
We need 1000 days not even a question
This was cool
If my math is not wrong, which, probably is because math is definitely not my strong suit, but if you were to binge-watch this, it would take 12 Hours, 59 Minutes, and 4 Seconds, again I am bad at math.
LOL
I really hope you continue this series
You can access the end if you enable strongholds in the options
11k dislikes why i generally want to know

You can easily survive in superflat forever, you just need to cover yourself with blocks, the hunger is no problem, you can survive on half hp forever if you don't get damaged.

3000 Days! We love you Luke!
11:33 HOWS IT PRONOUNCED THEN??
You could buy a lot of iron armor and smelt each piece for a iron nugget for free iron. Granted it’s going to take at least 9 emeralds for a single iron but you don’t have to kill golems for it.
i want 3000 days on the normal worlf
E
I don’t know what Luke means by the gast in the nether scaring him it literally saved him because he was about to jump off the edge I’m just confused but in my opinion it save him
100 day's in my girlfriend chest

It’s not a LukeTheNotable video without a farm xD
I've never subscribed to anyone after watching one video but when you made the mom joke I just had to
Omg I used to do this when I was younger!! You would pick a direction and pray for a village Sorta glad I did it so much, cause now it's instinct for me to sprint/jump for speed, and to look out the corner of my eyes for anything of value. This was a nostalgia trip!  Edit: omg I just realised that I did this before the update, when villages didn't have trees or extra chests. Finding a forge with tree in it was like finding diamonds

By the way if you pull up the coordinates thing you can see what day it is

When u going to do 200 with tors
Luke: Killing bi***  His mind: FU** Luke: I mean umm witches

eyy how is everyone doing today
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.

Hello
Id like to see more of this series!
yo how yall doin
Clerics have a chance to sell bottles instead of pearls luke! Get luke to see this so he can make pots
Has anyone realised that the video is exactly 30 mins long
wow haha
I can believe he didnt make a day 69 joke 🥺
Wow ...only luke can make a superflat fun :D
please do 200 days
I try this challenge in hardcore but I die when Im in the nether
That gravel really is precious because you can use it to craft more dirt. Between those blocks, you could make actual terrain. Also, can't you get sand from wandering traders on occasion? Either way, with the extra dirt, the occasional sand, and a cobblestone generator you should be able to build actual terrain and even get nice lakes with a sandy bottom.   It doesn't surprise me that you couldn't find a way into the end though. There is a bug in the superflat generation that either prevents structures from generating or prevents them from being found even with locate commands if they do generate. You can't even use presets to get them to spawn anymore, which is a shame, because giant stronghold worlds are interesting.
...what?
You could just say flat not super flat because only Nubes say superflat
I would like you to continue this series!
Despite your rebellion against God he loves you love him back love Jesus back he died on the cross for your sins even though he would be better off without you he did it because he loved you then 3 days later he rose from the dead u won’t find Jesus bones anywhere he is risen confess him as lord and savior put your trust in him believe what he did for you believe he rose from the dead and you will be saved❤️😋
I hope he makes a 1000 days
2:13 "Coal doesn't exist"  *sad wither skeleton noises

all of these comments are mega fresh for no reason   *this video was made 3days ago how the fu-*
I couldve done this if I had a better pc
How did you - wha
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
That was pog
Why r these comments so fresh
"Today I'm going to survive 100 days in Minecraft superflat"    **goes to the nether at day 32**
Why comments so recent

Like and sub to Lukethenotable for more vids like dis
hello luke! can you do 100 days surviving zombie apocalypse pleasee
at least replace the wood with dirt u took from the houses, zombies can stand in those v's n turn the villagers
You can put water 8 blocks apart for your farm
This has 8.5 MILLION views in 3 DAYS!!!
Very unexpected, very poggers
well straight away u failed, by stealing from the villages like the special craft tables, furnaces , barrels, etc u will lower them to bums or just farmers, if ur on superflat trading will be ur savior,  selll their produce to the farmers for ems, kill zombies sell flesh to cleric, build the cleric up u get enderpearls n xp pots,  u could get to level 30 in minutes,  walling off and protecting that 1 village at spawn would do u more favors than stealing thier stuff u should of protected that first 1 and raided others further from spawn
What would you even do for 1,000 day
Strdjtrddytdfy yes please continue
I’m leaving a comment so that he continues the super flat
More! I need more!
This is an excellent example of a high-quality, entertaining video! Loved it!

Superflat is the Trader route of Minecraft
Thanks for the link of the map(:
Woah not late!
Wait it’s not pronounced elytra
Him looking around so fast is making me sick
Really? Do you even have to ask if we want more? Yeah we do!

Anyone remember the superflat nether on the Xbox360?
#3 on trending
This guy sounds like the dad from fairly odd parents
Why is everyone here
I like how he speaks
Hey Luke, there’s a really effective cobble stone make with pistons and red stone thought I should let you know
why did you shout saying silence😂😂😂😂
The puzzled shovel systematically juggle because aunt spontaneously program apropos a well-groomed bell. mammoth, confused radish
Luke:one apple a day keeps the slimes away  Me:one soul a day keeps the devel away
The nether actually used to be flat in a super flat world
This is more entertaining and interesting to watch Even from the normal omg
200 DAYSSS
we need part 2
Wait...how do you pronounce Elytra
LTN the new pewdiepie
How does he do it
You made flat world look fun

Hello
"sure i don't have (hoe's) but i have my witches" - Luke TheNotable - 2021
how do u make something soo boring look soo fun
You roasted us more than it was comfortable during the video. Someone needs to timestamp the roasts.
Hint: you don't need a nametag for an iron farm.  Zombies have a small chance to spawn with the ability to pick stuff up. Once a zombie picks up an item, they don't despawn
MORE MORE MORE
MORE MORE MORE MORE
no,
Yes
ltn why did you make a tower house in you hardcore 100 days
I love these videos!!❤❤❤
Do a challenge where the water level rises every 10 days.

Luke: witch Me: bi*ch?
Please do 200 days - this video was one of your best
200 day plss next vids and give me a heart
Loved this
other youtubers are funny unlike you
Local YouTuber slowly has his mind broken by slimes
you can make name tags now...
PLS CONTINUE
I played Minecraft sinse the beta and still haven’t found diamonds
i like how he didnt milk the regular hardcore series but instead did the impossible.
CONTINUE
Video idea - I fought 100 people in PVP Legacy
U cant beat the dragon with cheating and placong a portal
I absolutely hate the sound of slimes so I understand your pain
Shoulda built a cobble generator  Edit: nvm I just got to the part where you used a cobble generator
5:00 mins in Luke has already done more things on flat world then anyone
Interesting now you are doing minecraft superflat like your videos
yo, why do I see comments from minutes and seconds ago??? wasn't this uploaded 3 days ago? lol.
PLEASE MORE!! XD
So fun to watch 😍
3000 days hardcore?
wOaH
There actually is a way to visit the end in a superflat world. Activate cheats and type /execute in the_end run tp <player> <location>. If you are not okay with that little "cheating", you can sacrifice some eyes of ender or something
I feel like this video is brand new with the number of new comments
make nethrite armor next time plz continue the series
In early updates the nether is flat on Xbox 360 you can also make it so that end fortresses generate but there are worse villager traits and trades I hope this helps
More super flat
This video has done crazy good in such a short amount of time
if luke made a vid a day he would be getting over 10k a day WOW
I’ve watched this video 14 times no joke
*This Must Be Boring.*

"Killing the slimes keeps the slimes away"
200days

YOU JUST FOUND THE RAREST THING IN THE GAME. YOU LITERALLY FOUND BONE BLOCKS
Me before see this video : survival in flat world is imposibble  Luke Thenotable : *wear diamond armor on survival mode
U cab fish for glass bottles
Use the organs of your enemies to create your home
It will be cool for 1000 days

Minecraft player:*creates super flat world* slimes:its free realestate
50=Killing slime 40=tradeing with villagers 5=DİAMONDS %1=minecraft

Haha I say it like you and my dad dose to
You can still find the stronghold, but its just in the air someplace....
Nice plz do 200 300
8:23 thats a lot of diamonds kinda sus
Strange the nether used to be Superflat on PlayStation 3
PLEASEEE 200 and maybe 300 I loved this video and hopefully series
anyone know the seed?
If you’re curious about how slimes spawn they can only spawn on specific chunks in the world, which is why a fence is effective as long as you’re not fencing in part of a slime chunk
Your entire world is a farm
Now try this modded with ProjectE. Could be pretty interesting how your strategies would change.
Yey new vid
how did he get 10 iron from a golem?
He built a big wall, and the slimes paid for it.
Kill the wither and get a beacon
It actually was flat at some point I can remember it
Here are some tips in Minecraft  Make a 4x4 square and put water in 3 corners of it. Then you have infinite water  That was the only tip lol
Do 200 days
You should totally continue superflat world and find a way to get sand and make a sand castle or like a small beach
basically slime and village simulator
When is it going to come  200days of Survival in superflat world  ❤️❤️
13:47 bruhhhh what did you just say
umm whats with the comments
Keep this series going please I love it
Nobody else realise he  has a  lodestone compass and he never found netherite
8:23 I feel good dododododo
His pain is funny
You can use shovel on a grass to make it a pathblock. Since pathblocks are not full blocks, they are spwan proof
13:46 Well... That’s hurtful :(
Lets see how many subs i can get before this video gets 10 mil views, current: 2
Oh you have killed my friends!!!!!! You will pay for it 😁😁😂
do it again
Go on with the series , please !
I never knew that perfect cell made a Minecraft channel. He’s pretty good too😳
I don't know y but super flat world bothers me a lot.
interesting though, since villagers can sell armor and weapons you can theoretically get all the iron or gold you can want.
how did he manage to do this?
200 days of superflat pls
if you want 200 days like me spam 200 as many times as you can in 20 seconds
I like your videos but since u made it your own video series by copyrighting other youtubers u aint gonna get attention bro
Sus 29:26
Imagine that fertilizing grass with bone power made saplings
200 days
I was legit surprised at how well this worked and I really want more!
200 plz
Start of the walkthrough: "I HATE SLIMES!!!" End of the walkthrough: *_"Oh slimes, awesome!"_*
200 days plssssssssssssss
What you should do if you do 200 days, is get a name tag and name a vindicator Johnny. That’ll keep the slimes away
you can leave 8 blocks between your water streams
impossible
We NEED 200 days of this
we need a part 2
will you do 200days in minecraft superflat?

If you place a single water source in the ground then till soild 4 blocks in every direction you get a 9x9 area of farmland very efficiently, then put a slab on the top of the block the water is in. And me happy to see you alternate crops as they grow faster when alternated
Pls continue this

20:27 Cures the villager stuck with a zombie smh

How Does He Get Water In A Flat World
I would be AMAZED if you could do much after 100 days, I’m not saying you couldn’t do it I just don’t know what you would do. Maybe fight 3 withers or something crazy
"An apple a day keeps the slimes away. No it doesn't *nothing keeps the slimes away" LMAO

Continued this pls
For those wondering, here's how you say ELYTRA.   Correct way "Elite-Tra"  Wrong way "E-Light-Tra"  And the dumb people say "glider"
1000 days
His 100 200 300 Days Survival Hardcore, 100 Days with Tors, 100 Days Minecraft Superflat ARE ALWAYS ending in 30:00 min EXACT 30:00 not 29:59 not 30:01 BUT 30:00 LMAO
you pronounce "elytra" the same way i do lol "e-lie-truh"
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.

Hwy luke can you do 100 days in ark?

Luke, only some chunks spawn slime, if you use f3+G you can see chunk borders and start to identify where the slimes are spawning, then you can put fences around the edges and have them contained.  Please like so he can see.
Luke the notable just uploads a video and doesn’t tags anything at all

200 days now.
Me a attack on titan fan: OMFG wall sina is coming to place
Zombified Piglins should be removed, all they do is scare piglins away and stop you from using a bow to kill ghasts. There really is no point other than gold farms, and they are useless otherwise. They are annoying, and just making husks drop gold would be a replacement, because husks are better. Zombified Piglins are redundant and useless, and they should be removed.
I would love to see a 100 day Terraria hardcore video
Simp 26:50
I'm so exited for this series!!

200 day plz
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping everyone from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Yes do more of this superflat

You too can be Saved just believe and put your Faith in God and Seek him through his Word and you will find Salvation.  Repent and Turn to Jesus Christ before it's too late.

why do i remember this? i got deja vu several times throughout this video and could recall the memories they were from and predicted what would happen next because of the deja vu. what is going on?
Minecraft 200 l survival ok
Luke: it’s elytra I’m just saying because I want people mad Me: it is correct...
It’s not pronounced E-Ly-trah? Wish I knew that a while ago
the baby slimes dont attack
The gleaming top perioperaively blink because sunflower conversly spot beneath a near flavor. purple, two mustard
Hardcore sky island?
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
Elrichmc: pathetic
11:34 I honestly thought that’s how Elytra was pronounced lol
10:00 hey look nether rack!
Ties 200 says
LukeTheNotable: it’s not pronounced elytra I just say that to annoy people!  Me: that is how it’s pronounced
How did you Break emeralds with glass
Luke kinda sounds like Varrick from TLOK
younger me: you can't survive in superflat, there's no trees! luke: well.. I mean..
LTN is not a YouTuber he is a business man

I love luke but he swore
Every time I join the flat world I never get villages so I’m gonna cheat I little bit then put survival
You can whitelist strongholds as a structure that is able to spawn during world creation, otherwise the end is permanently locked off.
Beans
I actually had no clue that he wasn't pronouncing elytra wrong. I've always pronounced it like that.
When you are mining the nether gold smelt it for an ingot.
Luke the best
i want another hundred days this are so fun to binge

"Grabbing all the lava i can" i guess you can't get lava from the nether anymore

This is the first video of yours I've seen and I am subbing rn I like your style man
I wonder if luke is gonna make another series when 1.17 comes out
1:47 The reason slimes don't spawn inside your fence is that slimes generally don't spawn in every chunk. There are so-called slime chunks in which you can spawn between height 0 and 39. Your base is clearly not in any of these chunks. Nice video
Hey im not even mad at this new seris its very new so its good

It's honestly impressive how much you can get done on a superflat
I actually think this would be pretty fun to try with a friend on hard mode
Hi

The stongehold is aboth ground

So we all here at the same time now, huh?
According to Luke, nether wart=netherrack
Fun fact: the nether was actually flat in super flat worlds at one point. I’m not sure when it changed though (probably the nether update)
This was such an S teir video
200 days
I never expected to see someone blace a beacon on gold *because they didn't have enough emeralds*
"Suprisingly the Wither didn't do much damage to me" Says that while losing 2 hearts in one hit

Earth is flat
when he said "argh" when he found diamonds I burst out laughing
Exactly 30 minutes is so satisfying...
how else do you say elytra?
I say ul-eye-truh
I played superflat a lot on the PS3. You can add ores and whatever. You can add or delete layers as well as change how thick the layers would be. So it would make this so much easier.
The dysfunctional interviewer evolutionarily groan because snowflake epidemiologically tickle than a thundering day. cheerful, gainful cartoon
When I saw you uploaded a new videos I clicked faster then my hun teacher his grandma
So cool
What about 100 days on survival and you can only use stuff that you get from villager trading
Luke:cusses in a video YouTube: eh you good Sml: cusses YouTube: banned  Why yt WHY
The slimes dont spawn in the wall becouse ur base is not in a slime chunk where the slimes spawn. They spawn becouse ur actually at y4. So basically underground 😊
you could hear the JOY in his voice when he got glass. it's like when you get netherite
Please do more of this minecraft superflat series , I really do love it!
could you do 100 days on terraria
The nether used to be flat until the update
E
How is elytra pronounced them. I thought that’s how it was pronounced
o m
h
15:21 "This is the only block I have unlimited of" Me: Please use cobblestone! My eyes can't take it anymore!  Slime blocks go brrrr
How do you get further in superflat than i get in a normal world lmao
i am doing this but on bedrock edition and villages  dont spawn in bedrock edition on superflats so I through myself a bone and gave myself a bonus chest and a water bucket
But what’s with the new comments?
Luke: plays flat game 100 days. Me: lives for 16 years In a flat country.
Do moreeeeee pleaseeeeee
the best thing about superflat is that u can move villagers easy
man u like farm
Make a cobble genrator. Believe it or not, building a cobble gen is possible. Just find lava and water from the villages.
I started my own 100 days and i got netyerite tools in 26 days
The end won’t work because u didn’t add the end
Why are all these comments like 5 minutes ago?
nice video
8m views in 3 days...

Fun Fact: On the legacy PS4 version, the nether actually is flat in superflat!
А можно по русски
The free lunchroom normally multiply because danger overwhelmingly ignore pro a paltry rubber. poor, crazy south america
100 days in an amplified world would be fun
Feels like your channel has grown so quick, only feels like yesterday you were on 700k, respect and it’s deserved🤙
This is cool
anyone else get super baked before watching every one of LTN's minecraft videos, or is that just me?
Do 333 days in Minecraft superflat please
Plz make 200 days
Sure i dont got hoes but i got my witches  Luke TheNotable 2021
With you farm you can put 8 pieces of farm in between each water stream also in Xbox one edition the nether is flat in superflat
He did like 500 days in 100 good job
Lukethenotable be like 1000 days hello guys this is my emerald tower mk2
2:24, Donald trump speaking to mexicans...
Forge labs is better btw
Forge labs is better btw
hooolleeeyyy
guess what videos are going to be trending in youtube gaming for the next month? XD
I actually thought elytra was pronounced how Luke says it. :/
Attack on Slime
Why is literally everybody commenting like 12 and 30 seconds ago
I want Luke to continue the series and suffer.
I've beaten the game in Superflat, here's some tips! 1. Strongholds DO spawn in superflat, you just have to explore and find them in the overworld! 2. Build campfires around your fence outposts so that slimes die trying to jump on them 3. If you place down lava in the path of a slime, they are too stupid to move around it like other mobs and will just kill themselves in it trying to get to you. Lava buckets are the best weapon for fighting slimes early game!
Wait, it’s not pronounced e-lie-truh?
Luke you should make a song about COVID-19 with that beautiful voice you are awesome.
Peacefull mode makes the slime away
I greatly enjoyed that
Continue to 1000 days
Awesome
why's everyone here rn
He said it’s not about vanity. That’s exactly what he said in 100 days and I think everyone knows what happened to his base(it was entirely about vanity).
test   *hhh*
18:47  You sound like Kermit.
100 days of toor
Yes please you want 200 days of flat Minecraft
Can u do 100 days on gta5
The villager's actually reproduce faster than my mom!
Disgusting how you trademarked this series so nobody else can do it. Used to respect your series and channel but trademarking a YouTube idea is just wrong. You can't own an idea. You can't own something on this website.
Still can’t comprehend why Luke made an iron pickaxe
no way my guy said netherack instead of nether wart - 9:59. and he said blackstone fortress instead of bastion LOL - 9:39  Edit: 4 likes lol
I didn’t think someone could make a super flat world so entertaining. Nice vid!
Hey! Can I use this idea? Superflat survival I mean. Not hardcore or 100 days, I would credit you and everything- but I know you have something of a monopoly on this and was wondering if I could use it?
200 DAYS PLZZZ
Another idea is 100 days on sky block
Basically that's the definition of ltn
I love upbeat moderators
Cool fact: The nether used to be superflat. I played the Xbox 360 version for YEARS just after the release and remember that it was just a huge box of netherrack.
I think it is pronounced ‘elitra’
If you do any more videos on superflat and you don't care about the slime balls you can use lava against the slimes and it destroys them
Hey Hey some netherack. luke. its netherwart
For 200 days, you should start by building a huge grave for your horse  He was a real one 🙏
I tried this awhile ago, I smacked a zombie piglen trying to kill a skeleton you can guess what happened next
If you saw this pretend I said something cool and funny
please do more of this, I love it.
That was an adventure
This guy gives me DETERMINATION  to keep working on my survival world bruh
hey!! you should try to get green dye from traders or sea pickles from traders so it looks like grass but you use green carpet OMG U LIKED IT AND HIGHLIGHTED IT OMG OMG
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
Can we Appreciate how he doesn't Put ads In his Video? :D

22:53 my nans dead mate
Yay
A bit late but your farms make my head hurt. For a max efficiency farm (most amount of farmland per block of water), make a 9x9 square and put a water block in the very middle, and it will water all of those crops.
yes PLEASE CONTINUE THIS
11:33 I’m fairly certain that it’s pronounced the way you say it Luke. At least, that’s how I say it

Romans 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. Romans 3:24  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.  Romans 5:9    Much more then, being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Romans 6:8    Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:  Romans 6:9    Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.    P.S. If this impacted you in any way please let me know. God Bless. Have a great day!

I hope you know Luke that you can just use carpet on the stone fences so it looks way better. I didn’t know if you knew that or not. You don’t have to use fence gates anymore.
More! MORE!
This guy has 10000 terrabytes of storage

Don’t forget 200 days with the Tors
200 days with Tors when?
This was definitely an interesting take on your Minecraft  survival series. I'd be interested to see how you did with a Minecraft Hardcore Skyblock world. Those are fun, kind of like this.
Noice
Your like the trump of minecraft WALL!!!!!
I thought spending 100 days in Minecraft hardcore on a normal world was hard but doing Minecraft hardcore 100 days on a superflat world is even harder
e
23:34 home is when you place crafting table next to furnace

Plz plz keep up this series
There's a glitch that makes strongholds not generate in 1.16 superflats.
The nether in older versions was actually flat on a superflat
This inspired me to try this

Couldn't all of your footage be considered... Notable moments 🤓
I’m clicking off this video and leaving a dislike because you insulted my grandma
I would really like to see you doing a 2000 days but with modded minecraft
Good job
200 days?!?!😜
if you mined the nether gold with a silk touch pickaxe you could've smelted it and gotten 1 golden ingot instead of a few golden nuggets.
I think you should be able to spawn in the end portal
Continue this good shiz
Mojang: everyone should have a skin   Luke: shut the f&*% up
Is it just me or is his merch super funny
The nether used to be flat
Slimes: Yeetus cleetus your life gon deletus
Luke: Tors said she liked it so it is  staying Me:SIMP
Hold on a second... did you say that it’s not pronounced “elytra”???!! How do you pronounce it then??
Nice 19:47

19:59 blackstone fortress? Bastion isnt it?
Plz do 200 days
getting bonemeal easy, if you had kelp you could build a kelp farm and use the kelp to make bonemeal. if you had cactus you could build a cactus farm a use it as a bonemeal farm. you could search the nether and find a crimson or warped forrest and use a hoe to get so much nether wart blocks (the leaves of the nether trees) and use those to get bonemeal. all using a composter.
hey you sould play rlcraft 100 days
I didn’t even know you could play survival on superflat
I heard you like slime.

The imperfect brain literally increase because flower contrarily spark near a ill-fated lobster. seemly, puzzled mechanic

“I’m going to spawn the wither in this church”

In the flat world there's no structures with a village and not even underground how do you think the Edwards bond in three blocks that's crazy an impossible because you can't even go and go under the void and build

Btw to beat the dragon on super flat you have to play on 1.14
Fun fact : the nether used to be super flat until idk what upsate
I feel the most under appreciated part of these videos is the fact that they are always an exact time. The 100 days are always exactly 30 minutes. The 300 days tour is 44:44. 1000 days is 1:30:00. The 1000 days tour is 1:11:11. 2000 days is 2:00:00.
Pls Do 200
What an abomination of a wool farm
Please do 200 days

he forgot that cobble geniraters are a thing
Please do more days!!!!!

200 days
Love your vids i subbed and liked im showing support so there
pls do 200 days!
Petition for 100 day sky block
Love the vid I was there when you started at the level 100 fortnight in 1 day
damn his name is not a lie
You should build a slime farm👍👍
you should do this in a normal world template (oen of the super flat world templates)
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
This video is very notable
5:50 bitches😂😂😂😂🤣
Pls 200 days
How’d he get the load stone he never talked about it
No jo no no no no no no no no no no no
Put 4 spruce saplings together in a 2 by 2 formation Now wait for it to grow...
200 days super flat or 3000 days normal?
Official Minecraft wiki: 'Access to other dimensions Superflat worlds allow the player to access the Nether by building a nether portal in the usual way.  Superflat worlds also allow the player to access the End, which generates a normal dimension of floating islands, if strongholds are enabled.' you probably forgot to turn on stronghold structure generation, thus there isnt a stronghold, thus your eyes of ender wont work
when are u gonna do the 3000 days
WE WANT MOREEE
15
Just gonna act like nothing happened?
Love you
Shield?
This could be a great opportunity to build a bunch of flying machines
what if you make a superflat+ server? mhh, i'll work on that...
Luke: "thousands protested against the wall, so i killed them" Trump: I notice you've copied my style. No offence Luke :)
Bruh continue this series or make another on a full world i would literally watch the whole video no matter the time.
Flat world is a pain.. No ores, no caves, just 3 layers of dirt and then straight bedrock..
The nether used to be flat in the old version of minecraft ehehhe
This proved luke is a flat earther!!!!😮😮😮😯😯😯😧😧😧😦😦😦
I love your minecraft hardcore vids! Keep up the good work!!
LNT: Ok now I got the totem of undying ME: Ok now he is immortal and powerful
Here's a notable fact: You can toggle mob sounds in settings for when you want to build and not go crazy
Hmm, wouldn't you getc copyrighted for making a 100 day video, hmmm
This is pretty wicked, keep it up!
W H A T
obligatory comment so that the video gets attention and Luke continues the series xD

wait how did you get the undying totem? what did I miss.
i hate to break this to everyone: Superflat hardcore is easier..
His pov is 69 lol
This was really great
funny thing is, turning grass to path blocks should also get rid of slime spawning.   also, slime chunks are still a thing. slimes don't spawn just anywhere, only in the designated chunks, so if you figured out wich chunks were slime chunks you could have pathed those over (or carpetted, or dug to bedrock) and slimes woulnd't have spawned unless you went beyond that area.
Where is 200 with tors
I think that he died in the other hardcore world and he doesn't  want to tell us.
"Nothing keeps the slimes away" Laughs in peacefull
U need to turn on strongholds
Killing Beaches?? @-@
Please make hardcore 100 days survival with Forge lab
Solid and sturdy unlike your grandma!  -LuketheNotablw

Alex is gonna have a beard at 1000 days
Clickbait because you can't find villages in flat world...
Love this channel haha
Was I the only one slightly annoyed he built his new house away from his old base?
Never knew superflat survival could be so interesting to watch.
you could've turned on strongholds
Fun fact: in ny version or device there is NO villages. So its pretty hard. :)
Imagine having full netherite on a superflat world

8:22 Utter bullshit,  best amount of diamonds you'll get is one or two I had never heard of anyone getting six,  alongside a saddle if it wasn't for the abundance of diamonds and obsidian not to mention the nether fortress you found magically without using any techniques or the instant efficiency four pickaxe this would seem legit.

16:10 attack on titan episode 1
I like the fact that you was able to get to neither, in flat world, and almost beat the game already if it were'nt for the fact that the end did not exist.
It'd be appreciated if you were to make a video where you'd show your deaths.
Please do 200 days i would like to see what u will do in 200 days such like 2000days
I like how it’s called “superflat” but structures still spawn, but in bedrock it’s called “flat” but it doesn’t have villages and structures so flat is flatter than superflat
who's going to tell luke you can't go the end in super flat mode?
Please do 200 days

Okay to be able to get into the end in a super flat world you would have had to go into the world settings before it was made and messed with what structures could spawn, so these 100 days, while good, cannot beat the dragon without cheats to spawn in the portal frame. :(
cant wait for the 200 days

Luke can make a house made of emeralds but cant make a beacon made of emeralds. I hope he makes 200 days or 1,000 days because I want to see if a full beacon or as I call it max level beacon or level 4 beacon  don't know why I just call it that. And if he can make something netherite I will be impressed

Just a tip in case you or anyone else sees this, you don’t need a name-tag just give the zombie an item it could be anything and it will never despawn. A name-tag works better but early game just give it an item!
hey luke i have a idea for 100 days can you do 100 days skyblock please
can i get 3000 days pls
Minecraft 100 days but with mods
And people who unlike are selfish!
No longer #1 trending lol
Will no one talk about how fast he got full F****** DIAMONDS
9:59 "hey hey some NETHERACK that should be helpful for potions"
I saw someone play supperflat  and found the stronghold up in the sky endrpurls  don't work
I'm the atum 2 mod the dimension you enter to actually start the mod pack is just a giant desert but if you're lucky you can find a biome called the oasis when entering you get an achievement called "maybe there is hope" the oasis biome has trees and a few rivers and ponds which is cool because it's a forest in surrounded by a dry empty desert they should def add something like that in super flat because it would be a cool little Easter egg that you could strive to find
I want him to make a slime farm cuz why not?
Why are you milking this
Make a 200 days PLEASE
2:10 he is placing the wood and taking them why ?
Witch or you know?
#1 on trending!!! Good work!

The rough society syntactically taste because gun specifically extend versus a abnormal segment. gullible gusty, sassy process
Yo I want 200 days so bad😂 I sat in suspense for 200, 300, 1000 and 2000 days patiently waiting. When I saw this I was like ohhhh man likes at it again. Where’s my popcorn😂
Ah no there’s bots in the comments... shit I seem like a bot don’t I. Whatever
This is for the algorithm
On og xbox 360 minecraft super flat nether was flat. The good old days.
how are u so goodd.... on the first day i am just hiding in a dirt hole :(
This just in, LTN genocides all slimes from this flat land.  I tried to rhyme it, I really really tried.  Also, hi Nifty Smith.
do 100 days in terraria
200 days plz
It was so nice to hear nothing but SILENCE!!!
Plz continue this
I did not think this would be that cool but is it up there with 1000 days just not as long 😞
It is pronounced elietra, thank you for saying it this way
Do a 100 drops for collasium
That one time when the wandering trader was actually useful
Dis was amazing
Support
I have a theory that LTN cheats. In one vid he used and auto fish farm that had been nerfed in the version he was playing in.  He got 6 diamonds from a chest  He backs up his worlds  He goes on about how he had heaps of attempts for his hardcore worlds and deleted most of the footage in frustration. That’s just not smart, I doubt any utuber would do that  And  this is just a theory not saying I hat LTN or anything

Just killed a Bicth fellin good 5:51
Before the 1.16 update the nether was actually flat and had a huge bedrock wall at the end of the nether

Hi

A true American story.  Profiting off of sheeps by kidnapping them and trapping them to stay in a 3 foot area to forever be sheared for emeralds. Enough to make a grown man cry and that’s okay

How come everyone is like 5 mins or less xd
if you mine the nether gold with a silk touch pick and put it in a furnace it will give you an ingot instead of nugget
Nice
I just love his accent-
Love this man he is a legend
Yes
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
I thought he was just being careful on his hardcore survival now in super flat i knew hes a god player

I never thought that super flat in survival would be fun turns out its almost like skyblock this takes a lot of skill and id love to see 200 days in super flat
I've already subscribed  and I've liked the video  so here is my comment:  MAKE ANOTHER ONE!
I'm hella rich off sticks LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3000 days?
roses are red, violets are blue, here is a view, cause I like you
you can put a stronghold in the world using the presets
You could make some landscaping, to break a little of the flatness.
1000
my god this is amazing! i’ve been playing minecraft since 2012 and i could never do something this good. i’d love to see this continue! :)
Is it weird that I honestly want another videos of tors and you
Tell me how there is so many comments that where posted 2 seconds ago... 2 days after the video has come out.  Did the youtube algorithm just decide to recommend this to everyone 2 days after its release???
The king is back
make 200 days
Wait it’s not pronounced E-lie-tra?!
Wait how is Elytra actually pronounced?
Love the video. Your voice and excitement is fantastic. Your cadence with comments like, "Got a nice new partition today. Don't know gonna fill it with farm land." Reminds me of Oklahoma! You could totally don this video as a musical. You're a natural.  P.S. Yes I'm a Boomer. Yes I like musicals. Yes, I  play Minecraft, who doesn't?
The only way for strongholds to spawn in super flat is to turn on enable strongholds so I don’t think he can do the end in the future
In 200 days you should go back and find the horse you don’t care about in the crimson forest
Can't wait for 200-1000 days
5:50 19:08 luke switched witches and ...       Nevermind
Noice
i have 2 questions.   • why is this possible • how is this possible  thats all 🤪
Supportive comment 👍
Why did just get a notification about this video?
“Stonks were pretty good on day ten.”
You don't need a nametag for an iron farm. Just kill a bunch of slime and leave their drops and see which zombie can pick it up. Once they pick something up they wont despawn.
Please do more dayssssssss
blackstone fortesses lol
We want 10000 days please
Ha yes,2 minute ago comment,my favorite
Did he just said B******? Lol
Yeah please keep doing this I love it. Also is there a set date for 3000 days?
Easy spawnproofing: dig to bedrock - mobs don't spawn on bedrock. grass paths - not a full block so mobs don't spawn.
I love how he focuses on roasting our moms more then his life 😌💅
His axe does 9 damage

#8 Trending!
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are 176 different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.

Why does he always drop his sword when he gets hit???
I'm pretty sure Xbox 360 had a super flat nether!! But I'm not positive that was a LONG time ago.
What are rules? In the face of corruption, rules are meaningless! In the face of broken systems, broken laws, broken rules! They don't follow the rules, why do we follow the rules?

MASIVE BRAIN go to 1k days

Wouldn’t be a super flat world without using diamond, Gold, Iron, or Emeralds as your house
are you doing 3000 days in hardcore minecraft or just ending it at 2000

I love your intuition. I initially thought you'd be holed up in a ragged base made of dirt, logs and cobble fending off hordes of slimes but you really made something here :) making use of the villager trading was smart. Good job
just the fact that luke didnt do something fun for day 69 makes me mad
why did ppl dislike

There's no way to get flint in superflat *getting obi from blacksmith, going to nether (using flint and steel from black smith if that's not a thing you can use lava from next to the blacksmith and burn the portal with wood, and then trading with piglins for gravel and using that for flint or mining gravel from there* : am i a joke to you?
Me playing normal minecraft: Omg this is to hard.  Luke The Notable: Play's super flat.  also me:_______ I need to step up my game
*My Live Reactions:* - - *[Luke:]* "I gonna spawn it in this Church and surrounded by Golems, I'm not sure if it'll work but it's worth a shot." - *[Me:]* "These Golems are crying for his genuinely stupidity!" - *[Luke:]* "When I went to summon it today unfortunately the footage corrupted-" - *[Me:]* "I guess it was too violent for the audience." - *[Luke:]* "-Not all of it though, I've got the fight here, the Golems died almost immediately." - *[Me:]* "I bet they were!" "LMAO!!" 😂🤣 "I've seen it coming from miles away!" "HahahaHAHAA!!" "What a f@#$%ng idiot!" - - Am obviously joking with you Luke, I don't see you as an idiot, but I have to admit I laughed a lot in this scene, it was my favorite from all the bunches, I saw their faces agonizing while you were dragging with your horse, it was priceless, although I didn't expected your mistake to put all four trapped in the same Church, the doubt risen when I saw you remodeling inside out the Church, I was like; "Oh no, he won't-" "NO!!" LoL - I loved it, great work there, can't wait to see more of it, dude. 😉👍
30:00 minuts wasted on my life from seeing a male voiced pixel girl playing a blocky block game

God bless yall dont forget to read ur bible to grow ur relationship with christ
"And yes, I know it isn't pronounced e-lie-trah"  *wait what*
Love your series! I wish you eternal luck in this seemingly impossible challenge!
Somehow Youtube had unsubscribed me from you, lucky for me you reminded me and I checked to make sure I was. Thanks for reminding us.
Is anyone gonna talk about him waking the whole time and not sprint jumping
his video "corrupted" i wonder how that happened (he cheated)
Ayy nice #1 on trending
Everyone: FIRST!!! The internet: Well yes, but no.
Not me playing a flat world like Luke🙄😅
If it isn't called elytra than what is it called?
No one gonna talk about 9:08 like get a better enchantment, not bane of arthropods
I think I speak for everyone when I say these minecraft videos are what keeps us going throughout the pandemic please keep them coming 😆😄
Can you do 100 drops cod warzone
This was fantastic, most definitely a notable watch
This video was amazing, couldn’t imagine how much work and effort was put into this.
I'm glad Luke has been such a blessing to the minecraft community by not only being very innovative creative and fun. He has made new challenges and ways to continue playing this amazing game we call minecraft. Luke has been a great person and is more.... than just.. notable....
:O
Piz keep playing
Pls do another 100 days superflat pls, I enjoyed it very much. Like if you agree. Commet "Yes" if you want another 100 days.
No 3000 days please
Haven’t watched this yet but I hope you made an iron farm
congrats on trending
200 DAYS
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are tons of different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
Where "mathematically" could an "infinite flat plain" exist? At the poles of a Singularity- where the "sphere" of the singularity is flattened into a "HyperRing" and dimensional vectors approach Absolute Value.  Pretty cool- unless you happen to be a "virtual, entangled particle"  during a "Pole Flipping Event".  Why? Because to remain Entangled requires Spin/Charge to be *unObserved* - as observation causes INSTANTANEOUS State-Superposition Collapse.  But  Y'ALL saw ME WATCHING YOURSELF, AND THUS SAW YOURSELF WATCHING ME WATCHING YOU.....LOL    And what caused the Observation to occur in the first place...(REFRACTION OF LIGHT, like in an Infinity Mirror, FROM DIAMOND ARMOR)  *VIRTUAL INSTANCE COLLAPSE*  THAT MEANS YOUR NO LONGER COLOCATEED -AKA- HARDCORE MODE.  IMMA UR HARDWARE & BACKUP NOW.    1 VHR = 2000 HuY (last observed CP measurement)
Me: wears the LTN sweater to school My friends: YOUR A SIMP
Did he die on the other hardcore series
Almost 7 million views in 2 days... he'd better continue it
Very funny!
it sucks that Xbox 360 nether was flat but its not anymore
Do 200
200 days please
200 days is a priority for me to watch
26:53 why is there a lodestone? To craft a lodestone you need a netherite Ingot...
Luke: Iv had this idea for months Kids who grew up on stampy: hold my apple juice

Skip 200 go straight to 1000
Can we please just get notification saying ‘Making a Hardcore minecraft world w/ Philza, Wadzee !’ PLEASE
I dont know the exact number but i can pretty confidently say that the number of people getting triggered whenever he calls bastion remnants “blackstone fortresses” is above zero.
What happened to the 3000 days?
rere
alternate title: minecraft but no
How do you say Elytra properly?
You should also do a 100 days in the nether where you only live in the nether and no where else
What if you tried to survive in one biome? Isn’t there one in the sky where you can see mineshafts and it doesn’t span villages or something? LOVE your videos! 😍♥️
weird seeing all these comments less than a minute old
when the slime breach the wall  THE SLIMES HAVE BREACHED WALL ROSA
I also say elytra like you
he said the b whord
I love the way you sound in 0.25x speed
Some Ideas If Luke Decides To Do 200 Days   1. Find a Wandering Trader and get some hard to access items like bamboo and cactus. 2. Get Netherite tools and armor from the Nether. 3. Build an iron farm with villagers. 4. Build a full beacon. 5. Get another horse. 6. Try to get a second max power beacon. 7. Fully enchant all your tools and armor. 8. Upgrade the base. 9. Build an exp farm.
27:18 Optical illousion
Good job I literally have done this over 1 and a half years ago, maybe 2.

Mod farm??
noice
Pleeeeas I need more episodes!
luke:*itchs i mean witchs (* is something i am using to cover the swear)
Lukethenotable should ask Sean from forge labs to make him one of those cool custom modded worlds to spice up his hardcore hundred days Because I gotta be honest forge labs is not the most amazaing man at Minecraft but the notable man is no offense I think this could really spice up the content i fact they could do a collab I really think the modded maps and custom maps forge labs does would be amazing with Lukethenotables hundred day content
There, I wrote a comment, now upload agian
Ya mum
He said a badword
pls 200 days
I've been waiting for this for SO long, hope we have another 9 episodes.

Luke wait what happened to your 2000 days world?

Witches more like......                   Bitches lol 5:49

Wait elytra isn’t pronounced elitra

"hey hey some netherrack that will be great for making potions"  -Luke TheNotable    2021
You can get glass from villages with silk touch
now you gotta do minecraft amplified worlds
In the old mincraft the nether was superflat like the map
i think this is fake because he got netherite for the loadstone but didnt say he did
Cant wait for the next video
You should make a sky base so slimes don't bother you.
I don't know if it's just me, but I want some Halo content. I know that Minecraft is the smarter thing to do viewcount wise, but it still would be fun to watch like 20 games of a halo game.
who was here before 1 mil views?
Do it 200 to 2000
I can’t believe that Lukethenotable is the most abusiive man to villigers yet does not like hurting golems
Why is there so many comments
200 days pwease
The dreary brother comparatively rinse because tune contemporaneously alert along a slippery format. courageous, ill lion
I hope he does 200 or 1000 days, I can almost see the emerald pyramid now
Everyone: Superflat worlds are USELESS.  Luke: Hold my beer.......
wait its not called "elytra"
do 3000 days next!!! please
Anyone agree that it seems (and maybe even IS) impossible to beat Minecraft on super flat mode, but pretty much anything else is possible?
This is cool

I love this soo much

Focus on 3000 days
Where new 200 days with tors
Yes a new series
more
hello
Noice
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are tons of different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
"hey some netherrack time to make potions"

In 2015 the nether was super flat.. aaaa the good ol' days
Me: can barely survive in normal mincraft  Luke:surviving on flat plus hardcore I feel ashamed 😞
These videos are apsaloutley brilliant, very entertaining and good quality and I'm not just saying that so that my criticism is balanced, love the content. However.  Some advice: I think it would be really cool if you could get a skin
hello
I felt it when he said SLIME
Hi
PLEASE start smelting nether gold ore, you get a whole ingot instead of gold nugget(s)
How is this so good
I take it back this is a stupid idea
Lots a memes in the comments but no one saying how actually entertaining and enjoyable this was. I would really love 200 days!!!
Omg hi Luke I’m your biggest fan ❤️
Make 43 billion years in Minecraft
man i liked, subscribed and now im commenting   now continue that
Its nice how so many minecraft videos are trending worldwide now!
Why
i just realized that he can get to the end
It only takes 21 days for diamonds in FLAT WORLD
WHY SO MANY IN 1 MIN BRO
WHY IS SO MANY CommeNTS A second ago
The responsible france intraorally satisfy because morning socially scream up a lethal ease. handsomely, cute flag
YAY
9:25 I didnt know he was a woman
you dont even need to mine to beat minecraft anymore :(
BUCKET
Where did this come from
Luke and green square houses is a universal constant isn’t it?
You can get bones from the remains in the soul sand valley in the nether
3,000 days super flat my guy
Finally something diff... Nvm
lol killing some piglin children made me feel better
the nether in superflat was flat in the old xbox version
If anything, its easier to make a huge green tower here, since there is enough slimes. That should be your signature, every series has to have a green tower
Everybody gangsta until the nether is super flat and only spawns magma cubes
Oh my lord- I loved this please do more!
Accidently swore
SINCE WHEN DID THEY STOP MAKING THE NETHER SUPERFLAT ASWELL!?
Wait its not elytra.
U can smelt armor to get iron nuggets just fyi for 200 days of superflat
Lukes a. S I M P
YAAAAYYyYyYY!!!!!!ANOTHER ONE!
So everyone’s here now?
"you can't have any, you don't have rights" can be taken WAYYYYYYYYYYYY out of context
moreeee
continue
More of this plz
Hey Luke, I liked your video as always.  But you need to have a goal in mind for you future videos.  I mean it was cool how you did it for the first 100 days.  But now you need to think of something to work towards.
amazing video sir
I like to see 1000 days
This is my first video of yours and i love it keep it up man
Once Luke said he wanted to use Iron Golems to fight the Wither I remembered that time WadZee used his golems on one block skyblock and they fell into the void after first explosion
The nonstop literature comprehensively transport because jumper wessely strip between a bright millisecond. little, brash cell
The slimes did  not spawn in your base because it is basically made out of corpses for them :)
Finally A masterpiece from the master himself
When the world needed him the most...    He returned.
I think that... the strategy in superflat would just be to go to the nether. A lot more things there, significantly more interesting, and likely less dangerous, as crazy as it sounds. You get gravel, you get gold, you get coal, you get blaze rods, you get lots of blackstone, naturally generating wood, and lots of lava. Instead of worrying about a million slimes, you just need to be on the lookout for ghasts, piglins, and hoglins. All other danger there is quite easy to avoid if you're careful.
"To hear nothing but SILENCE"
200 DAYS!
DO 100 DAYS RL CRAFT
HE SAID THE B WORD 5:49     lol
Hey Luke! If you're reading this then you can get bones from the fossils in the nether!

solid and sturdy unlike ur grandma but my grandma has cancer..
this is actually really impressive!! good job! i might try this sometime :D
We all want more tors and 200 day flat
ngl i love this video but i feel like superflat series would get boring for all of us because of how repetitive it gets, so i dont think you should make more parts to this. The video was amazing and it was really interesting to see you do things ive never even were possible.
Please make 200 days
I think he should Make his house out of gold and quarts
You should probably get your own skin meybe? That would be cool if you ask me!
Luke when Caves and Cliffs come out please do another hardcore video
Dude there's a tipe of cat who give you random stuff
You make great and creative videos thank you for making my day just a little bit better a part 2 would be wonderful
really nice video luke!
200
I was NOT prepared for how much i would enjoy this video!!! please do 200 days !!!!!!!
Kids be like OmG LuKe SoWrE
Continue on
10:00 Netherrack?
Plz a nother one
Please make this into parts :D
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  In PvE their are 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade 1 perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft  a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are a 176 different creatures you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.
Was this guy playing 10 minutes per day or what
He’s 100% going to turn into a slime soon...
Part 2
At 22:53 my grandma is dead BOTH
Do a 100 day skyblock next!

If you make another ep, and still feel bad about the golems make a poppy graveyard since they drop poppies when they die
nobody know that we can do this
Luke TheNotable i have a challenge for you the challeng is: You have to survive 100 days withouth villagers ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
“Superflat”  Hmm.....  “Superthick”

Try 100 day is Skyfactory which is a mod where your entire world starts on an oak tree and one block of dirt and you continue from there. I would recommend researching first to understand the concept.
You know the world is about to die when Luke TheNotable is bored of his farming and the profits.

I want 200 days
I think thay should add a stronghold on minecraft superflat like of you agree

*The reason why his world is superflat is because after 200 days, his power grew too much...all feared him...he decide he wanted a flater world so he could build more evenly, But something went wrong and his destory half the world...And so the world became superflat!*
I’d love you to make 200 days super flat

M.lreddsssees Tgjjgivvf
I thought this was a joke
The world: imagine living flat everyday?  Countries with flat surface: am I a joke to you?
When do you get a real skin
HOW DO YOU PLAY ON THIS FOV
No chain
This is an excellent idea and I will be taking it, thank you
i thoght you said your dad works at fortnight
My name is Luke, so I sub. Luke’s together strong
100 days in a super Flat? Cool!  100 days of Minecraft skyblock? Amazing 😉
Whats the point of a pickax when there is nothing to mine?
13:46 Ehm what?
This basically attack on titan in a nutshell. But the slimes are the titans
some things never change
Use a command block the spawn and ender portal so then you can hopefully fight the ender dragon in a super flat
Luke you ok? sounded like you're going through a mid-life crisis at 20...
What the- all of the comments are from seconds ago...
he sounds like he's rapping every 10 seconds

"Killing B!tches on my land" - Luke The Notable
*Hi*       Hi
:0
Please make this a normal series this is so interesting to watch
nice
I watched this video when Luke was on 1 on trending
Pp yes pog
Go to 1000 days or at least 200
Dang, I did the maths and the avarage time spent on each day is a bit less 18 seconds. If you don't belive me here is the math:  30 minutes are 1800 seconds (30 x 60) The video contains 100 days, so we divide to total time, which gives us 18 seconds per day. There are intros and outros, and those take time, so my guess is that the avarage time given to 1 day is between 16 and 18 seconds.
500 days
Luke: shut up slimes!  me: minecraft sounds, OFF  nice
Make 200 days ples
This gamemode should be called "Try to survive slimes that are super annoying and can spawn in daylight"

Hi can you pls continue this love your vids
Finally a upload
200 days!
200 DAYS! 200 DAYS!!! SUPPPPERFLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTT
You dont need water every 5 blocks. He still is a noob after all these hours
200 days?
Imagine claiming '100 days' because you re an uncreative degenerate:D
Thank you you are so cool and you inspired me to do 100 days in hardcore Minecraft and I have died a lot lol.
There’s definitely a spam
My guy if you make a 100 days video please do it without cheating. Weaponsmiths have a 16.2% chance of spawning 1-3 diamonds, so definitely not 6 (8:19). It is just more fun to watch a 100 days without cheats because otherwise you could just go in gamemode 1 and give yourself netherite armor at day 1 and call it a day. Still a good video btw!
your voice is intoxicating
In a Super-Flat world, Eyes of Ender won't work, However, Strongholds do spawn, Sadly, this means you'll have to look for it yourself. Edit: I forgot that strongholds dont spawn in super flat 1.16 +
Finnaly
Luke did it, he made wandering traders usefull.

Day 7 between farms can be 8 blocks becaus farm can be long 4 0 4 long

Why you Alex?
“Im going to build a wall, no slimes allowed”  Trump: i like the way you think

A
200?
I've been doing this for years and I gotta say, it's quite a fun challenge
if you read this Luke please read all of it, thank you.   Like this post PLZ.           I love watching your Minecraft videos, but i just got into a new survival game called (Ark Survival Evolved) and I would love it if you would make a 100 days in ark.  If you Don't know what ark is I will try to explain.  So, in ark their are two main game modes PvP and PvE.  when you join a PvP server and you and a bunch of other people start on one of the nine maps in your own separate tribes trying to survive, when you see a another tribe you can ether attack them, join their tribe or ask them to join your tribe.  But, if you were to do a 100 days in ark than you will probably be doing PvE.  PvE is just you trying to beat the game by killing  all the bosses.  In PvE their are still 9 maps, but for 100 days i would recommend starting on the island.  If you get the ultimate version of ark than you can start on the island beat it, then move to scorched earth, then move to Aberration, then move to extinction then to Genesis and finally to Genesis part 2 when it comes out.  Know to explain the real fun part of the game, the leveling system.  In ark their are 105 different levels, each level you will be able to upgrade I perk, for instance you could upgrade how much health you have so you don't die, but their are many different perks you can level up, I recommend health and weight.  The other thing that comes with each level is a few new items you can craft.  For instance when you first start the game you can craft a a stone pickaxe, a stone axe, a  camp fire, and a stone spear,  but to unlock these items you need to spend endgrame points witch you get when you level up,  pro tip DON'T unlock everything it's a waste of endgrame points.  At level 20 you move to metal tools, and at level 35 you can make a one shot rifle, and a level 55 a you can craft a shotgun,  Your going to have to figure out what you can get at level 105.  Did i tell you you can ride dinosaurs, yea, their are tons of different animals and dinosaurs you can tame and ride,  like a dragon or a t-rex.  their are materials
Luke calls netherwart netherack
28:48 triple and double check??
SIMP
yes im making a second comment but how the actual hell do you not say elytra like elijah but replacing the jah with more of a truh
I search on other how to beat ender dragon in superflat world and its a thing There are stronghold in their world and I wonder why the eye of ender don't work. and nice video
cool!!!!
Plz make more man I love your vids so much, this world could become awesome, not that it isnt already
I would love to play with u!
Stop trying.
Please make more
btw you can turn off those annoying slime sounds by lowering the Friendly Creatures volume. Just a tip!

At 11:33 you said you don't say elytra correctly but that is how it's pronounced.
No wonder he hates slimes. One almost killed him in 2000 days.

The wither is the final boss!
To get to the stronghold you need to up the amount of layers there are and the enable the stronghold
What about "100 day's in the nether"
200?
Luke: "It ain't much but it simple and it works! " Me: "It ain't much but it's honest work!"
Can we all respect that this video is all ready number 1 trending
Heres a suggestion: Do Harcore minecraft but with the tors.
When u realise 5 mil views in a day aint enough to bring back the world😂
This is attack on titan with slimes
you know it's a good video when the trending is not in video game
Continue the series before all of us raid your house to do so. Trust me, you don't want 3.4 milion people in your house.

The fact this man is more trending than a robot landing on another planet is accurate

this was great  I did a 100 days super flat world with my friend and we died fighting the wither
"First time?"
Luke just safe bithes Idint know that he swears.....
I really want to ignorantly believe this was all done on survival mode only, but I can't help but think some cheating was done with sneaky video editing and creative mode to save time. None the less, fun video, don't normally like Minecraft content but this was enjoyable.
Do day 200
More
Great video, but i think that in the flat world there isn't much to explore, so why not moving to the nether? Piglins and Zombie Pigmen won't attack you if you don't bother them, you have unlimited pork meat, there are a lot to explore in the nether since 1.15 update and you won't be doomed to listen to slime noises for another 100 days
Number one on trending gg
How is this trending
Me waiting for all the people doing this challenge theirselfes.
did u die in hardcore?
20:24 Can we please talk about this beautiful transition between Luke turning around in the Nether Portal and moments after in the Underground tunnel? That is some editing skills!

5:52 Luke TheNptable: killing bitches
You didn't credit the original creator
The slimes remind me of attack on titan
One thing that is bothering me is...you have iron, you have wood...why didn’t you build a shield? I mean you’ve got totems of undying so now it’s pretty redundant but, it would’ve helped earlier on. :)
Are you doing 3000 day on your hard-core?
Survival 200 day luke :)
This is oddly interesting
mans is getting only 3rd on trending atleast S rank 1st above supirior

3 block golem kill is 100% safe and you won't get hurt. Speedrunners use this method if they find a village to gather iron.. it's 100% safe
Do 200 days plz
Tip: use wood logs in a furnace to get charcoal and use that charcoal to make torches

I believe there actually is a way to get an end portal in super flat. You change some settings before you generate the world
Perfect 30 minutes

Hello, I need to make a  promotional video around 5 to 10 minutes. How much does it cost? If the video is adopted, we can have a long-term cooperation
Im Empressed by Luke Notable never though anybody can survive on a flat world
I tried to start this survival world on bed rock and didn't find a village

Why did 7 thousand people look at this and think "no"
leaving a notable comment to show yes I wanna see more so here's my little support (also just realized I wasn't subbed so I fixed that)
It was AMAZING 🤩 it was new and I’ve never seen anyone do this, I didn’t even know you could do this. During the lockdown I’ve been really down, and this has cheered me up

I don't understand how you get five million views just playing superflat.... People MUST BE BORED
2:03 It may have 2 doors, but is your crafting table next to your furnace?  Update: At around 23:19 you can see that it is indeed. :)

There was a moment in time where thousands of comments were made within minutes late in the night, I was one of them
6.9k dislikes       Nice
Is nobody talking about how he said netherack but it was nether wort
Wow
Who else is scrolling through the comments while watching the video
Killing &itches-  I-I mean witches 😄   Also;I'm pretty sure its pronounced elaitra but maybe I'm wrong
Basically the whole video: Slimes. 😂😂😂
Ngl, and this is just my opinion, but this is more boring than dropping the ocean 100 times
I Actually Test That BUT I DIE IN DAY 2
Cow
Do modded Minecraft
killing bitches???
Next video: 100 days on amplified
#1 Trending in the U.S!
1000
You are AWESOME! I really love your content you always make me laugh with the jokes "faster then your momma" I died hopefully 100-200? I'd love to see it and watch how the world progresses I'm honestly shocked at how far you got on a super flat world like WHAT, keep up the good work
You know life is good when you get your own slime farm without making one.
i dont have emeralds but yes a whole house made of it 🤣🤣😆😆
Does this mean he died in the making of 3000 days hardcore?
Nope, when you die in a hardcore world, it isn't over. You can reenter the world, open to LAN with allowed cheats and switch from spectator to survival. So, you could die as many times as you want-- its just glorified survival respawning.
use a hoe to break leaves faster
that was sick

Brilliant idea
Wait i thought that it always was elytra- 11:35
Аttack on slime :D
I love these series ^-^ ❤
The slimes are coming

Idea Time, 100 Days On 2b2t Or, The Oldest Anarchy Server In Minecraft
Love this but please just build a iron farm
poor horse lol
Try world type: caves its even harder and you can find end portal
This is number one on trending, meanwhile I’ve been watching lava, and tnt superflats, ice spikes, island, and all types of one seed hardcore all day. But this is number 1
Make 200 days now please I might die if you don’t hurry make slot
I have a idea  You can put white wool under the stone fences next to the carpets it would look much cleaner
i thot super flat was impossible
Congratulations of having First trending!
6,9 dislike    Its between good or bad
Impossible.
this is great
Series
Ah yes, 6.9 dislikes.
YouTube trending is just 100 different youtubers making 4 videos that are the exact same thing. Very original idea buddy, the amount of titles with “100 days in Minecraft” is a ridiculous amount.
Woke up just in time for some notable action
10:00 nether wart
is it just me or did he get farther in superflat then he did in normal minceraft!
Love this world!
Luke do a 1M days hard core minecraft on the 2000 days one
Comment
more more more more MORE! wait a sec did he say b*ch on 5:51? or witch
The slimes care not for my grieve. That one was gold
This would be an awesome series if it continued, I played a superflat survival a long time ago with my brother, but I think it was before villager trading and we were pretty bad at the game anyways so it was pretty much just us defending a village. It's awesome to see how much you can achieve in one of these worlds, I'd love to see how far you can go. However, it's a shame you can't get to the end, maybe one day it will be possible.
You should do a series on the 1.12.2 mod pack.
Loved this video, pls make 200 days superflat hardcore
your dad works at minecraft? SICK!
oh no
The hard-to-find centimeter intringuingly guard because roast identically tow through a longing decision. evanescent, trashy locket
Sequel please
Congrats on Number one trending

Me and my friends used to do this all the time
put magma blocks around the fences to kill slimes
200 days pls
It's not lukethenotable's video until there is a emerald build🙂
“ It’s so TRANSPARENT “  Luke the notable 2021
I watched this and was so entertained I couldn't believe 30 minutes had passed
Love these vids. But I would actually like to see a "Goal build challenge" where you take. Structure/Biome on a specific seed to guarantee getting that structure or biome at a reasonable time. And make as great of a base as possible within 50 days. Which not only takes less time but is significantly less grindy and allows you to put out more videos and play more scenarios more frequently to help prevent burnout. Just a thought.
Moooooooooorrrrrrrrreeeeeee
why no use piglin dfor more items
Can you do 1000
HHhH everyones commenting so I will
Quite flat
What's the seed
Hmm I guess liking my own comments put in on top???

U can add layers with ore in ur flatworld
Was this first try or did you have a couple other trys if you did you can make a video about the mistakes you made from the other runs and how you learned from them in this one
You should use the infinite rail glitch for 200 days
Do day 200 on super flat
Number 1 trending in one day
This is one of the best
I see carrots and potatoes notable sees stocks
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think slimes spawn in super flat because of the y-level. To avoid this, maybe you could make a sky base with a bubble-vator of something to avoid the slimes while also not needing carpet all over your base.
Randomly saw this on trending. And ngl his commentary is godly. I love it
The nether use to be super flat too I saw it myself....i think I now understand why it isn't anymore.
A better way to make emeralds (and its need a lot of iron and redstone) is to make an automatet tnt powerd cobblestone farm that produce over 100.000 cobble per our connect in to a giant supersmelter and the supersmelter to a caret dupper and sell all the stone to the stone cutter guy.The problem is the tnt dupper,becaus you need tnt and coral and still don't now how to get them. Ps:I wil edit the comment when I wil find out. PPs:This work on normal hardcore too.
i tried this and then died 5 min later
13:50 i hate u lol
Make fish farm you can get lucky
Why is everyone here rn I watched this earlier in the day LMAO
Luke you have to make the series till 2000 days

1rst IN TRENDING BABY LETS GOOO!!!
luke the notable if you read this i got a good idea, make 200 days with the tors
During a certain part of this video it seemed like he was mad or was upset about something I just found it quite strange he even said while killing zombies "idk why I didn't just wait for it to be day to kill them must of been going through something personal"
1st on trending!!
There's 35,380+ comments, if you find mine you're a legend.
Make another portal in nether to find the end portal
wait it's not pronounced like ee-lie-tra   my life is a lie
if ltn is on a flat world then y does he have a pickaxe
"i was gonna do the ceiling but tors liked it so its staying" everybody say it with me now SIMP
Imagine spawning in as a slime and seeing a box made out of your flesh
What about 200 days with tors?
yeah 10:00 get some netherwrak and brew some potions because that is what we use for brewing potions                  why did you come here go to the video
The king is back!
Challenge:make a super flat world a normal wolrd
Luke:double layer wall  Me:for the titans?
No way, He stole my Idea!
my guy why dont u have a skin
I would love to see 1000 days of this!!!!
WHY R THERE. O 2 DAYS
Unlock the damascus camo on call of duty warzone
Why are they all so new
Nice
I love this guy
You need to get a skin
You need to change a setting to get an end portal in a super flat world, and the end portal you'd probably have to build up to it though in an older versoin

Wow This happened
is there going to be a 3000 days hardcore
I don't know why but I watched the video to the end...Although I don't really like Minecraft
i think before the nether update the nether was flat maybe it was only bedrock edition tho
Subscribed!
Petition for flatworld 200 days
But...but why...
alright i have a little bit of advice as someone who's done a LOT of goofing around with the superflat worlds: you need to intentionally enable strongholds using the preset generator, which in my experience works a little... weirdly in recent versions of the game. They  might have even axed the ability to easily edit them completely, i'm not sure. once youve done that you can basically find them by looking at a map. theyre aboveground structures that take up a ton of area and also are easily visible if your render distance is up
Comments will be (12 seconds ago.)
Well the Nether WAS flat. I sorta remember and all I can say is there was a lot of pigman and slightly more ghasts than usual
Dang
Plz do another video of 200 days in Minecraft super flat plz.💓💗❣️♥️👍
I think Luke should make his own skin

A zombie farm could also kind of act as an iron farm, as well as a normal xp farm. They would also be super profitable with some cured clerics.
He have full diamond armor in day 22 while I have no iron tools or armor.
Luke why didn't make a mob farm
I don’t think I ever heard Luke swear but when I did it was great
Try building xp farm

NUMBER 1 TRENDING
Am I the only person who is watching this for the second time or is anyone else weird.
so, trademarks eh?
Quite a notable challenge
69 fov I'm a casual I use 90 fov
Please don’t make me wait 6 months for 1000 days
LOOK UP HENNA MARIA
YOU DINT MAKE A 69 JOKE ON DAY 69 !!!!!!!! >:((((((((((((
Can you do it again
dam ;-; just dam his first bad word
Like the series but someday you should do a 100 days on hardcore skyisland or skyblock
when you gonna do 3000s days
Quick question when are you gonna do 3000 is
Oooh 1st on trending
I laughing all the time for your commentary 😂😂😂😂
Wait elytra isn’t pronounced that way. Me and everyone I know says that
CONTINUE THIS SERIES!!!! TILL YOU DIE
Did he just call the blacksmith a weapon smith?? I’m disgusted
Cub ism
9:23  luke: not flat nether people: not flat nether bedrock/console minecraft players: pathetic
I love it
I'm literally in love with these videos I've seen all of the first hardcore videos
Are there 3000 days still?
most notable man alive
dude 1.16  strongholds don't spawn in superflat world
Minecraft timeline:"Day 100 = ?" In real life:"30Minutes = 100 day"
Anyone remember stampy's superflat series
Number one on trending?! Now that’s notable.
anyone fell like he just drank 50 packs of game fuel before recording this (because he talk faster than normal)                                           -just my opinion
Please 200 days
poggers
Make a super flat that has its surface at sea level. That way you can still find end portals and a mineshaft.
Yo why is ltn so good at these 100 days Minecraft videos I’ve watched the one with tores at least 5 times
superflat must have been rough
A waterlogged stair works in a cobblestone generator. Just put the lava behind the stair so the water flows out the opposite direction and you never have to worry about your lava
I will keep that notab-le
Luke I have an idea  Survive 100 days in a cave only no trees you can get wood from a mineshaft
hey luke how and how lucky are you to find 6 (when on its hightest its 3 ) diamonds in one villager chest 8:22
2:47 if eren jaeger was eloquent.
What about 3000 days
Wait a minute... If villagers can sell glass and the villagers in your 2000 days world will buy them for almost 3 emeralds per. Can't you basically make stonks after "curing" the villagers
I don’t want Netflix
Please do 200 days!
Hearing Luke curse is so jarring
how did he get a netherite bar to make the enchanted compass?
You were number 1 on trending :D
1000 days is needed.

So we all just here?
Trying to find my comment is worst then trying to find the bald guy comment
I just noticed that this is meant for 13+ I just now turned 13 and I watched this series since i was 11
The comments are new because it’s sorted by “newest first” you can adjust it by clicking sort by and then clicking top comments
1000 days of this will be interesting but so would 100 days of living in the neather
very notable
your first super flat series got me to start playing on hardcore
Okay. Wow. You’ve got my sub. Your voice just sounds like an awesome announcer!!
Am i the only one that caught he said nether rack instead of nether wart?😂😂
He made what looked impossible, still impossible
use a datapack or something to find the stronghold
the reply on this comment is gonna be a scam
This feels super rush and super trashy
Slime rancher
100 days of hypixel skyblock
he said he is killing biches
POV : you are wondering why all the comments are like 2 minutes ago, (LMAO)
EPIC
Is he going to continue the world with tors
This comment will have a scam as a reply lol    edit: ITS GONE 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
Guessing this got put on trending just now
26:50 HA SIMP

Every time he roasts me I take it personally
The only similarities this has to 2000 days is both houses are green
The reason the slimes didn't spawn in your base is since you were there. They can't spawn close to you
new series but first 3000  days!!
1 on trending
Hi you tube
No part two please
Man I love these

ITS HARDCORE JUST REALIZED THAT
never thought someone could get this far in a super flat this is clearly the notable way
Hiiiiii!
PART 2  PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2
Trending the notable way
Wait how’s elytra pronounced then?
I remember when he made halo video's
A way to get iron without killing iron Golam is with smelting iron armor ot tool from the villagers
do 2,000 days
You said to comment soooooo comment.
If u do 200 days (plz do) if u don't want slimes to spawn place slabs on the ground mobs can't spawn on slabs
Ppl are gonna end up doing the same idea lmao
This video deserves to be at number one. There's so many great small jokes. So amazing 😊
*Лайк если ты тоже русский *
1000 more days
I thought it was impossible to survive 100 days in flat world in hardcore
Wait, how do you pernounce Elytra? I've always said Ā-ly-tra?
I definitely want another hundred days
Rimuru's slimy revenge on humans
Why would you keep taking the lava from the villages after you went to the nether?
So how many times did you meet the doctor after this?
Its funny that even though in Luke's hardcore world, hes more stacked... He is more stacted in flat world than he was 100 days in hardore. Speaking of hardcore, I hope you are working on your hardcore world... You probably are
When the Slime is sus
Do 3000 days
On the old Xbox Minecraft you could put a setting where strongholds spawn
I’ve never seen someone blow up so fast but I’m very happy it was you!
Nice video
Really giving me attack on titan vibes
What’s the enchanted compass abt?
On the old version you could choose to make structures generate like strongholds that are above the world and caves too
S
Good job
Luke i have a big advice for you if you build a nether portal u can go to real overworld
1000
#1 on trending u did it a truly notable thing👍

I just noticed that Luke changed his title format
You should 100 days in superflat only bedrock
question, would y’all prefer him going 1000 days at a time on his normal world, or 100 days at a time?
H
POV: you thought this was another random youtuber but then you realized LTN
100 hours of hypixel skyblock
Egg
I’d be really down for him to make this series more frequently, like every 100 days; while the main series continues every 1000 days
pog

Lets do a 200 Luke!!
Hi people of the internet
This is me fulfilling my promise, he’s my favorite after so many heartbreaks. I thought it was time to give myself a break and focus on my job while trying to heal from my previous toxic relationship. After about a year and half I met a man who turned out to be my daughter’s boss , I was reluctant at first  but his  persistence and high spiritedness got me submissive. We started getting along so well , no day passes without constant communication, I fell in love and didn’t want to be hurt ever again; told him  my weaknesses and he told me his, along the line he came across his ex and his attitude towards me started getting cold. Seemed like deja vu all over and so I couldn’t let the anxiety tear me apart. I met a colleague who introduced me to the best set of Private investigators ultimate hack , I contacted and hired them almost immediately and they requested a down payment to commence the job after targets cell number was provided. After few hrs they responded with all the deleted and recent  messages , WhatsApp Facebook Instagram Snapchat gps and archives of pictures he has  been sending out; I practically had access to his  phone without his knowledge. Turns out he  connived with his  young sibling to test my patience and tolerance, all the info was carted to me , thanks to the hackers  I now pass his test with ease, lol . For assistance on how to track or monitor your spouse email ultimatehack003@ gmail com or  WhatsApp/call/text +17202954268 I wish you well as Yiu find out the truth about your partner just like I did

jesus.... children of the internet are so much more mature than 15 years ago. dude when i was 13- I had plenty of horrible things to say on the internet.
Continue
200
I didn’t expect him too make another hundred days, especially on a super flat but personally the only better video he has ever made was 1000 days, so this is second.  2000 days was alright but because he had done everything in the game the entire video was just making everything look pretty and millions of emeralds.  It was nice to see him start again and the basics and not be a god like in the other hardcore world
I think the stronghold might be on land sooo lots of exploring now
If you do more make the house wide to contradict your other blank day Minecraft
No 200 days with tors
Is this gonna be a series

Wait.. there are other ways of pronouncing elytra?
Question do we have to ask to do the hardcore challenge    Sorry

A kick in the ovaries is basically a period tho
why is every comment so recent
Instead of using slime to make everything he could have made a cobblestone generator
The non-super flat nether is disappointing
It... it's not pronounced E-ly-tra?

Hey Luke I have to tell you, one water source block can create a 4x4 square on all sides so you can make a ton more crops :)

Hey Luke The Notable, the only way you can go to the stronghold is if you have it enabled. So if you have it enabled you are all good.

Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ....................................................................................................................................................................................................

Luke is entertaining but he is not good at building
If luke had made the world generation deeper probably 40 or 50 blocks deep than the stronghold would have spawned.
I like all of your content but its kind of a dick move to go and tell others to knock off their "knockoffs" of the 100 days challenge.
Plz focus on the main series
Nice vid

I think you got Demonetized
Now you have to do 100 days in an amplified world
you should do Minecraft super flat but the different layers are different items, and there are certain challenges you have to complete (ex. defeat the ender dragon)
Darn 1 on trending. Great job Luke! Working on fan art soon :3

Enjoy your content. Let's see that 200...300...1000!

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)~
I wanna do this too but with a normal underground

brilliant video thanks as usual
Luke: *spawns in the world** Every slime within range: so you have chosen *death*
That thumbnail is fucking cursed
I wanna see a part two to 100 with the tors
Best
Luke should get End Portal blocks from Creative mode and place them somewhere in his world so he can still go to the End after switching back to survival, that would be cool
9:59   Nobody:   Absolutely Nobody:   Luke When He Finds Netherwart: Hey Hey, Some Netherack
DO 200 DAYS!!!!
5:26 LTN says that the slimes don’t have rights Me: But they have the rights to kill you  My cousin: 😂 lol
I've always had a soft spot for Superflat -- one of the first Let's Plays of Minecraft I ever watched was iJevin's superflat let's play in 1.2.5.  Yes, slimes are a forever problem in Superflat.

Ok I need this seed
Superflat...  Kinda like your girlfriend

100 days in the nether
Luke: Y'know i've really come to like the bedrock flooring it's stable unlike your grandma Me: It's not my fault she has cancer.

@PippenFTS
Love this, way coooooool, Cheers from our space lounge in Finland and USA
I have a good feeling about this carrying on until day 500 or maybe  1000!
These comments are 1 minute ago
I never even knew this was possible lmao
#1 on trending congrats!
Man I kinda liked it when you played fortnite cause you sued people for doing the same minecraft challenge
I actually did this challenge a while back, (i was on bedrock edition so there were no villages), so I was stuck, then i realized there's a starter chest option at the beginning of the game. There was no way for me to get cobble so I had to spawn in water and lava to make a cobble gen. There was some saplings in my starter chest and a stone pick in there already. I also made my house out of slime blocks since I was having the same issue with slimes. When it was night I started to fight mobs and got sone string, bones, arrow, enderpearls, spider eyes, and zombie flesh. I then saw an iron ingot on the ground, it was from the zombies! (zombies have a chance to drop iron) I made myself a shield with the iron and fought more mobs. I collected dirt and started making a farm. The bonus chest had some potatoes and carrrots so I thought why not just make a carrot and potatoe farm. I added a roof to my house then killed some sheep to make a bed. I bonemealed the grass to get poppies then dyed my bed red (veterans know why). After that I wanted to make a mob farm since zombies were the only way I could get iron. After that I got decked out with iron equipment. But I wasn't done yet. I spawned in more lava (since there was no way to get lava) and made a nether portal! I quickly found a blaze spawner and got blaze rods. I then found diamonds to make a diamond pick! I used my enderpearls to create eyes of ender. I then spawned in end portal frames (since there's no stronghold in a flat world) and traveled to the end. I then took care of the end crystals and defeated the enderdragon with only iron armor. I hopped into the portal, and I spawned back in my slime house.  The End
Keep it one
Get some pets from the nether (like striders) and make some friends like pigeons since you can make profits off them
Plz continue this series! It was such a creative idea! This was defiantly one of your best vids.

i remember in the older versions where you can customise layers and have hills added
I want him to make a grass layer another block up so he can change the roof in the basement or so he can get a floor because I don’t like the way the bedrock looks
Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.  Have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you; it does not matter who you are, he loves you. Maybe to help lift up someone else's day, you could spread this positive message around! Have a nice day!
which side are you on? slime rights        or Luke rights

When is 3000 days coming out
Very pog
Hey Luke, I'm pretty sure if you just run around enough, you can find the stronghold. They are aboveground, not below, just a little tip for 200 days because I'm pretty sure you're going to make one(if you don't I'll be sad).
gold no emreld yes
part 2 would be pretty nice ngl
on day 100 in a regular survival world i learn that coal is a good fuel for furnaces. wow i’m impressed
cobblestone genarator

PLS DO THIS AGAIN
Can't believe this got #1 trending. Also why is your FOV 69? Lol
Please continue
CONTINUE THIS SEREIS
pog
Within one day you have more views than subs 🤯
When I was 4 years old I thought this was impossible bc i forgot that you can get stuff in villages
I don't know if you know luke but you are able to turn the nether gold stuff into ingots if you take it with a silk touch pickaxe and put it in the furnace.  Just a tip for more gold and 3000 days 👍👍
You can do a 100 days minecraft dungeons video. (just an idea)
interesting video, first time you didn't kill the ender dragon in the first 100 days and yes continue the series it's prety good
you can make iron farms without zombies bruh
Number 1 on trending BITCHES! Let's try 200 days within 1 week.
Please make 200 Days
Flatter than Gura???
Launch it
"I wanted him to be a weaponsmith but he wanted to be a farmer" honestly, that felt kinda wholesome. Villager rights. Let the man do what he wants.
Most youtubers-off camera "mining"  LTN-off camera "carpeting"
Imagine trademarking a series for views
Why did you make a iron pick?
This is awesome unfortunately on bedrock villages don't spawn in
do MORE
Why do you need a pickaxe
POV you’ve watched this video 3-4 times already because LTN’s videos are amazing background noise
You are invite to my channel for cute cats 🙋‍♀️🐾❤😺🔥🙋‍♀️
"I installed my first beacon. On gold cuz I don't have enough emeralds" I feel poor 🥺
Ltn: Oooooo Some netherrack  Also ltn: mines nether wart*
me whos ten: I don't honestly care
When Luke realizes that you can’t get to the end without using creative😂😂
Continue
Well this is awkward.
I’m shiding rn

100 day series of skyblock would be holy but survival skyblock not molded or a server one just pure sky block
Yes continue
Congrats on #1 trending

“Oh, and, I definitely know it’s not pronounced elytra, but at this point I just say it to make people mad.”  You’ve described all my friends who genuinely think it’s pronounced the incorrect way.
Pls more m9re moreeeee
DAMNNNNN, HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING #1 ON TRENDING????

"When will it end? It'll never end because life is eternal suffering HAHAHA"
"Solid and sturdy unlike your grandma." Omg I burst out laughing.😂
#1 on trending congrats!
But what about 200 days with Tors?
So boring please don't do superflat world it's so boring man
How u have redstone😐😬
For those who want to know why luke had truble with 2000 days its because each minecraft day takes 20 minutes 10 for the day and 10 for the night 3 days is one hour 10 days is 10 hours he prolly gets less than 10 days in a day and thats not including editing
its like a zombie apocalipse, but with slime
2 on trending
You should put slime blocks underneath the carpet. 1. You have a lot of slime blocks 2. If you fall you won't die, you just bounce
1000 yes
slimes only spawn in slime chunks so work out what chunks they are and dont build there
First I had to deal with magma cube all weekend and now I get to watch LTN stuffer from 10,000 slides.
I like how u casually roast us through out the video
Luke amazing vid keep going and make a series pls
him: “i know it’s not pronounced elaitra...” me: “crap it’s not?”

There is actually an end portal in flat world but you have to look for it instead
Hopefully you don't scam villagers in this.
Make another video on this flat map !!

11:34 it isn’t...? I always called it that EE-LIE-TRUH
How does he find a way make a Beacon and went into the nether in just 100 day + he's in superflat
On bedrock i cant find villages in a flat world

Luke TheNotable: Blackstone Fortresses Me: The Ruin of The Bastion
Yesssss
Wow these videos keep getting more boring I'm so tired of these 100 days videos getting so many views lol
I think if you turn on generated structures or something like that mineshafts or strongholds can appear floating I'm not 100% sure though as it happened to me once before a few years ago
I want 200 days
Nice im gonna try this myself

This is number one on trending! Good job, Luke! We're all really anticipating 3000 days!
Really cool, I didn't expect that you can do so much on a superflat
Luke I've wached 100 200 300 400 1000 and 2000 days in your minecraft hardcore world
Really bitchis
Please for the love of everything make another part of this
I wish they had this on console.

ltn make more i enjoy this series so much and im also doing this same challenge i did a raid and obviously won
How is holly doing
LTN be like: "SILENCE MERE MORTALS!" *scared slime sounds*
you should do this with tors, after you make 200 days with her
yre is my mind
21:09 Luke actually trading the wandering trader instead of clapping him was honesty a great subversion of expectations.
You could get bottles by fishing, but that would be a last resort so if you find another way then do that
Luke’s brain:  Random cell: He should make skyblock 100 days  Luke: FIRED!!!  Random cell 2: He should do Hardcore 3000 days  Luke: FIRED!!!  Random cell 3: He ShOuLd Do FlAt WoRlD 1o0 dAyS  Luke:PERFECT!
Please 1000 days
The reason you cant beat the game is because you have to play in 1.15 for strongholds to spawn in superflat
"sure i dont got my hoes but i got my witches" - Lukey pookey

Honestly I prefer 100 days to a thousand days
Luke the notable your da man

This serie is notable
I want this to become a new series
Then, all of a sudden, slimes appeared and forced humanity into building three separate walls: wall Maria, wall Rose, and wall Sina. Wall Maria was the first to be destroyed by the slimes, and then humanity was brought into near extinction, with only one left.

fun fact Luke; silk touch pickaxes can get you the nether gold ore, then you can smelt it for whole ingots instead of just nuggets.
This was a great idea
I thought this was a joke video when I saw the title    It’s actually really good though
5:54 yea "witches" Lmao
Totally haven't watched this 6 times already 👀
It's solid and sturdy unlike your grandma
You need a custom skin man

Hey Luke, you can stop mobs from spawning on blocks with half slabs.  So if you coat an area with half slabs slimes should stop spawning.  Please tell me he doesn't figure this out past 23:00.

I've gone to great lengths myself to make sure my Mending librarian (who my son named Sir Mendington II) was safe and happy.

You should do 100 Days in the Old World setting. In that setting, the world has a barrier so it would be harder
10:00 “hey hey there’s some netherack” Bruh
"Alrght its day 4, I'm not dead yet, and I have a BUCKET"
From my memory, I remember that the nether on a superflat world on the Xbox 360 edition would be flat.

*Villager Thieves’ Guild intensifies*

Wow

100 Days without trying to make a 100 Days video
Bruh omg I was soooooo excited when I saw this 😁😁😁😁😁🤣🤣
i say elytra too
Is it just me or when luke the notable does a minecraft vid it immediately make's me wanting to play minecraft then i think about i don't have it on my Pc unsatisfaction
I'd like to see what you terraform the place to eventually look like, so 2000 days super flat please. Also, there are a lot more complications trying to play on a super flat than I thought, like no flying. no sand... it makes me want to see a custom-superflat world, where there are 4 block deep oceans, 4 block tall mountin biomes, tree forests stretching as far as the eye can see, 4 block deep swamps. its just a neat concept.
Number one on trending! Congrats
do 200 superflat so i have more time to stall making 100 days before you release 3k days
Yo that’s so sick thanks for the inspiration
1000!

There are no fortresses in Superflat Worlds. Means you can't go to the End
Slime noises

Strongholds do actually generate in Superflat, so you can beat the game, but they're obviously rare and it's up in the sky and there is not room system, just everything scattered around randomly.

Where is 200 days with the tors
In xbox 360 the Minecraft nether on a super flat world is also super flat. But the nether has border so there was a wall of bedrock you cant break even in creative mode.
0:23 0:24

I've lost respect for you, but this was an interesting vid
i checked if the video is in 2x speed becouse luke talked fast
Ain’t it wired how he got iron and said. “I made a sword and a pickaxe, I think most of us probably would.”but in the 100 days video when he got diamonds he said, “I made a sword and a pickaxe I think most of us probably would.”
It was kind of funny when when Luke said I'm going to fight William because he is a cereal killer
I just noticed you are on #1 on trending. Good job and please continue the series.

You can have a flat nether if you played before 1.16
9:59 "netherrack???"
Everywhere I’ve seen, the stronghold just spawns randomly in the sky, even if your eyes don’t work, just walk around a lot and you’ll probably find it
Amazing how he can make anything interesting
He meant "witches" you children.
Woo hoo! New LTN video!
#1 Trending?? Damn Luke, you're killing it.
Before I even start watching,I know how to survive in a flat world,it's get some blocks of dirt,and run until u see a village,take 2 beds,and all their wood,with the food and very rare cobblestone they have,do that continuously,at last you will have some diamonds and obsidian from the furnace thing in the village,and them go the nether,idk if it is the normal nether or flat nether,but as far as I know,bastions and nether fortresses should spawn with loot,but I don't think there is a stronghold,and if there is well DEFEAT THE DRAGON
Continue plz
You should make a super smelter, it's gonna be so faster if you make it
i love your vids

200 days pls this vid was so good
So you know you can get glass bottles from fishing and enchanting and by making a large enough village you can get iron golems to spawn in the village so free iron and all the villagers will have to have a workstation and have worked in the past a day and you need a bed for each villager
Plz make make a 200 hundred video
This video was actually really good and enjoyable bro plz make another I would love to see it and keep up the good work
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING!?
Hay I was wondering when are you doing 200 days with tors
Slimes spawn on big chunks of flat surface so you can reduce their spawn rate by placing random dirt blocks around the world
Luke, I quite enjoy your vids, but I was I was not a big fan of your whole 1000 days vids, as it was very short per day, and rather fast, please continue with 100 gaps as it is better. Also pls continue ur playthrough with Tors
Yes. Netherrack is good for potions

Please pin me I love your videos
I made a superflat world, used a guide to trap the slimes where they spawn, and build me up a town from scratch. It was pretty impressive.  My "homeland" was walled off and lit up" so I was safe within a huge area. I had a home, farm. Even a huge building I used as a bank storage where I separated all the extra materials I had. Unfortunately the fun of playing on superflat is starting up and surviving long enough until you can thrive. Once you have everything you need and build up your homeland, there is no challenge and gets boring. I had a huge homemade tree that I I made to store my tree supplies. Which was next to my tree farm.   This was years ago to I dont know whats changed, but I bet it was harder with less materials available.
Why did you say that to my grammar
We need 200 days super flat.
More days
My man beat MRBEAST in trending for number one
do a 100 days in the nether or in the end
on the console edition (not bedrock) there is a super flat nether

No let nasa be #1 for trending dummies
#1 on trending currently lol
I need more
sometimes it seems like you're very limited, but when you look at some minecraft features, you can find out that it's possible to get 90% of the items ofc there are biome specific items like bamboo, or non-renewable items like hearts of the sea which cannot be obtained, but making a gold/iron farm or getting full netherite items is absolutely possible it would be interesting is you could start with 12 end portal frames and some specific plants
1000days
Oh god thank you i learned many thing I didn't know before
This dude can do everything in minecraft

Thank you
Some say Pewdiepie brought Minecraft back, but we know the truth.         I mean I legit bought Minecraft on Gava just so I could play Hardcore because of this man, now that's Notable.

BRUH #1 ON TRENDING
15:45
Very good
Hey Luke the reason why the Eye of Ender didn't work is because strongholds don't spawn in 1.16 Superflat so you'd have to play this in 1.15 can actually beat the dragon
Is this going to talk over 3000 days pleas luke I need 3000 days
Ltn said the h and b word?

FIX
Axes do more damage then swords
slimes spawn in super flat because they spawn in slime chunks, and only below y=30, but the surface is at y=4, so almost all slime chunks have 100% free space for slimes to spawn  also light level restrictions don't apply to them

you can get lava on nether and not even run out of it
You should just spawn the end portal by commands and fight the ender dragon, is pretty sad that super flat words dont have abandoned mineshafts and strongholds
This is quite interesting tho
If you made a custom super flat at a lower elevation a stronghold could spawn
200 days
You now your so good that you mad a base in the flat world
Did you use any mods because every time I start a super flat world villages just don’t spawn. Maybe because I am on bedrock.

Hi Luke!! Your probably not gonna read this but if you do strangely on minecraft Xbox (not Microsoft on Xbox the original minecraft Xbox one edition) the nether is super flat! Me and my friend always used to do stampys flat challenge and whenever we went to the nether it was impossible because since it was flat it was just netherack and soul sand, there were blazes and wither skeletons too though. There were also mineshafts. I’m not sure if there were strongholds we were pretty bad and almost always ended up going in creative at some point but there could be so you should try it just a thought lol but you won’t see this anyway.
YAY LTN IS NO. 1 ON TRENDING 🥳🥳

Don't take too long to make part two like you did with multiplayer
Next 1000 day superflat
Did this scare anyone tho?
before this video: no one love the super flat delete it   after this video: everyone play super flat mode
i thought it was just a world to build a cool thing for creative but i guess its for survival to now do 200 days if u dare ;) Edit: OMG WOW THIS IS SO MANY LIKES
you should try to break the bedrock under your house for more storage
Wait, so how is Elytra meant to be pronounced?
look it's a slime house, i wonder who lives there? its lukethenoteable
I love your 100 day survival videos
NUMBER 1 WORLD WIDE TRENDING!!!!!!!!!!
Good job
but love the eps  too
noice
🥚
6 diamonds is very unlikely. I spammed at least 200 chests with smith loot, and I don't think I got more than 4 in one chest.  edit: Ok. I just checked my world again. Around 150 chests. Here is a list of most x in a single chest:  x=diamonds 4  x=obsidian 11 (happened twice. 12 probably possible)  x=saplings 14  x=diamond horse armor 2  6 diamonds in a single smith chests seems very unlikely, but it might be possible. I am almost certain, that someone has done the math, and made a youtube video about it, so if the question "is this run legit" is imortant to anyone, they can find a video and do the math. I must seem very hostile :(
This video is funny i dident think you could come this far in flat
It is not a blackstone fotress it is a bastion
If you keep making fletchers you have a chance 1 has arrow of weakness on master (works same as the potion)
what happened to the normal hardcore eps in 2000 you did not die i dont get it

Never thought i can be so frustrated with a video that doesnt have part 2
I wonder why you didn't have enough emeralds for that beacon
hey luke. if you are reading this then listen... im pretty sure it is possible to find the stronghold on a superflat. i had a superflat world and i found one.. (though it was wierd seeing it floating in the air) im pretty sure it exists but it seems eyes dont work so if you are gonna find the stronghold you are gonna have to look FAR and without the help of eyes. pretty sure you can use maps to see where you have searched.  EDIT: shut up bots and dont reply to this message
19:33 how did you end up getting bottles?
dont make 3000 days
This is awesome
200 DAYS PLSSSSS!

This is likely my least favorite one, as it just was really boring to watch. The world being super flat just erased most difficulty in Minecraft, and didn't really add any new.
This world is more flat than any women.

If you want to beat the game in superflat, you need to play on version 1.14
200 days please Luke
Who noticed he is swereing more
you make it look so fun boss
Slimes weren't spawning inside some of your walls because they only spawn on dedicated "slime chunks". It's worth doing a little more research so you can identify those chunks and work around them
End doesnt exist on superflat , you couldve enabled it before you played
heeeyy!!! he's stealing from lukethenotable's 100 days idea!!!1!1! copystrike him!11!1!!

Another slow way to get iron is to buy the cheap iron armor and drop it in an auto smelter fueled by buckets of lava from the nether. Each piece will turn into one iron nugget.

luke: says 'netherack' while looking at nether WART 10:00 me: (visible frustrstion)
He's literally one of the best Minecraft Veterans
It would be irony if somebody claimed it before him
make a basic mob farm  it would be really efficient cause of no caves to make the spawns less
the top of that house is *superflat*
10:00 he said Bergerac
done all 200 days
U can get netherite from getting diamonds fro armorers and obsidian
I need more of this
I know imma get owned in the comments but yes it is pronounced eh-lie-tra and i thought i was the only one who said that way.
Truly disgusting, that some "people" would do this horrible thing.

This is how many times luke said farm                    |                    |                    |                   \/
Has he already died in a diferent try
Wait....That's not how Elytra is pronounced?
My only thought was, elytra isn't pronounced that way?
Please do 200 days
Get full netherite next
Id really love to see a 200 days, these hardcore survivals are so funny and inspiring, I'm really mad my computer sucks rn.
Not sure what youd do, but I'd love to see more!
What do we want? 3000 days! When do we want it NOW
It's a good series 😉
GOOD TO KNOW THAT IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS ELYTRA THAT WAY like if u say elytra that way too and dislike if u say it the other way and also if you hate every animal on the planet and are a karen
Minecraft video number one on trending in 2021, the power of LTN is unlimited
Silk touch and brake the village windows better that nothing
is it true that LTN's dad works in minecraft
Oh you didn’t show us how many slimes you killed
Please make this a series. I am in love.
Do 200 days  like if you agree
Luke the notable slime 4kt?
You can get sand through the wandering trader I think.
pls upload every day
POV: You spent half an hour watching a man slap some sticky bois
the footage deepfrying was so funny to me omg
Me waiting for 3000 days. Luke the notable:May I treat you in an other way
14:24 why he has got 0 exp and seconds later it has normal again??
you even upload for a month.
Continue
9:55 netherrack?
just relised you can make a farm for coal,gold.,iron,emrald but not diamond and netherite
15:25 using dirt is actually better because grass can be spread 3 blocks downwards making the farm slightly faster
25:15
Continue this series please   Continue this series please   Continue this series please   Continue this series please   Continue this series please
If you had bought podzol from the wandering trader, you could have build a mushroom farm, so you could convert villagers faster
Yes
that’s hard.
When is 3000 day comin?
;3

Is that.. not how you pronounce elytra???
We require you to make more content like this. -raptor jesus
The legend returned
Whens 200 days with the tors
more pls
And the older versions of Minecraft not even that old but the nether was flat
The 69 Fov tho
But you are pronouncing elytra correctly
Some tips for you Luke if you didn’t know them already:  1. Use the Nether for lava, which can get you unlimited fuel instead of using precious wood 2. Iron Golems respawn if the villagers are scared enough or there are enough of them, so you can get unlimited iron 3. The farmer was a farmer because the composter was still there, you need to break any nearby work blocks to ensure they become the job you want  That’s all for now :)  Edit: a lot of this has already been found lol, don’t take notice
Can’t wait for 200 days luke!
The ender dragon got lucky this time
200 Days
Wait... Its not pronounced elaitra?! How is it pronounced? Eleetra?
This way wayyy more entertaining than 2000 days minecraft

The nether used to be super flat! I remember back then the nether was super flat on Xbox 360 edition
This true minecraft player😄😄😄😊😊
Minecraft
Wut editor do u use and wut recorder do u use
I remember thinking "oh this fortnite trend was o ly big for a bit, but still fun" Now it's also in minecraft and booming, the ratio of lieks to dislikes is insane
This is proof that the Earth is flat and is S U R V I V A B L E
How is this even possible
I think for the end you should have someone make the portal at random coordinates and then give you riddles or something similar
This series is gonna be better than the original😂
i actually like this more than the normal 100 day
Cool
Bloccers
slime rancher

Anyone else remember when the overworld is flat so is the nether?
YES!
You can’t only find the end in 1.15
a wall to keep slimes out.... Attack on titan vibe??
You should put slabs or leavs around your camp, then the slimes cant spawn
This is the normal comment you've been looking for.
Stone generator
Where 3000days hardcore?
Luke: Were best friends   *Until he dies*
You should go up to the nether roof then you can have the TRUE super flat experience

Fun fact, the nether used to be flat as well in an old version on Minecraft
Minecraft

Absoloutely amazing, and inspiring
A quick tip: don't always go for the mending librarian. If you cure a bookshelf one, that can be infinite emeralds. If you get is down to 1 emerald a shelf, that is when it happens. You buy a shelf, break it, sell it. Infinite profits.
13:45  Really hurt me
10:00 *ah yes,netherack*

Congrats on 1# on trending for 13 hours
You pronounce elytra correctly.

How did u survive it was amazing

You need to go to 10000 days
hi FARMS!!
This does not deserve 2m views. (I'm not bashing the video, it just blows my mind that it has this many views) The only reason I saw it, it autoplayed after a clip from "Fresh off the Boat". and I took my dogs for a walk.
FARMS!!
you know when you tried to go to the stronghold and it didnt work did you enable strongholds when creating the world

did he swear in day 20 :/
Please make a back up of ur 2000 days world I don't want the series to end
R u a human
“Hey Netherack! It can help make potions.” Me: wait but it’s called netherwart
The opposite of a speed run:
You could go a distance away and mine dirt to make a small hill for your house to be on, or a mountain to hollow out and make into a room
Plz do 200days with tors and super flat
Great job! I thought this was impossible 2 years ago, before watching this I was doubtful , now it's possible!
“Behold, I  the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?
I couldn't reject this recommendation!
Where is tors 200 daysss!,,
Luke you should really watch out for the wandering traders they can sell you sugar cane and you’ll need that if you want to improve you’re profits
Please make a 200 days superflat world

Do 200 days
Please continue this. Honestly, it was very entertaining for a super flat world.
I bet alex in her mind is saying I WANT DIE
I never new that this can work
In the nether, the biome with all the skeletons and the white blocks sticking out of the ground you can get bonemeal!!! If you mine the bone blocks (big white things sticking out of the ground) I’m pretty sure if you put those blocks in a crafting table it makes bonemeal.
Me: Awesome Also Me: How do you get that village in a superflat world?
10:00 "Hey some nether rack that will be important to make some potions" *picks up warts*😂  Did anyone else notice he said that?
Fun fact : on xbox 360 nether is flat on super flat world (well when i played it was idk now)
You can find the stronghold but not throw the eyes of ender
Thank you next(Episode) Thank you next(Episode).
“ I got two doors so it’s home”              I felt that
Love it! While I love seeing you progress so far past 300, 1000, 2000 etc., there's always something refreshing about seeing you start a new 100 days in a different setting/situation! I love to see your creativity in how you begin to survive in these situations! Hope you'll consider other 100 day starters in different worlds/ or with mods. Whatever floats your boat; I know starting TOO many could be problematic in progressing them equally, since they go on until IF you die. Nevertheless, I always enjoy you! Hope you and Tors are well and stay safe!
Hey anyone remember the console edition they had super flat nethers and I got one into bedrock
You can customize a super flat to find a stronghold
Anyone else notice at 21:40 about he loses all his levels? During a raid?
5:49 "Day 20 was a good one. I started off by getting free arrows, and killing bitches on my land." LMAO

Keep the series pls
I just realized I didn't subscribe to him
Fuook this man, he copyrighted this 100 days format
Wait how do you pronounce elytra then?
tip for the slimes! slimes spawn in superflat worlds because in minecraft, certain chunks are designated as "slime chunks". this means that in those chunks, at lower y levels slimes will spawn. well, normally, the surface is at y = 64; however, on superflat, you're at the same y level as if you were underground. so, the slimes will spawn, BUT they only spawn in certain chunks. if you could figure out which chunks they spawn in, you could wall those off or put carpet down so the slimes cant spawn. you can use f3 + g to see chunk borders (i think its f3 + g, its one of those f3 shortcuts)
200 days plez
Do pools not work? Could you have made a fish/squid farm?
Hiw did you gate water and seeds .😰😰😡😦
Bedrock Flat doesn't spawn a village

Well r u gonna continue this or the original
Please Please Please Make This A Series
Psychiatrist: What's wrong? Luke: I've been hearing slimes, that slabbing sound, every night for 88 days! I'm gonna snap! I'm also suffering from success.
Yoo he's back
Whos here when it's 1 on trending
Ps3 edition had a super flat nether too
i thought you say elytra like that ive been liveing a lie
Wait so you’re dad is working from Minecraft
is #1 on trending good enough for a sequel?
how did this get #1 on trending (no offense)
Español xD
I think strong holds dont spawn in 1.16
100 days = 30 days
Anyone else remember when the nether was flat on a superflat world?-
PLS part 2 200 days in superflat
Even in a super flat he still finds a way to make profits
More pleaseee!!!! This is so good
Reminds Me Of AOT With Those Double-Layer Walls
The way you say elytra is correct though?  I haven’t heard anyone say it a different way.

LTN YOU SAY B SWARE NOOOOOOO
Cwsuse awm scawed
Yaaaaay
This is good
O..  200 days with tors!  200 days with tors!
you need to add end fortress into naturally spawing structures in the superflat settings
When it's attack on titan but with slimes.
What would you even do for 1000 days on super flat?
I actually like this series much better than the hardcore only one. Luke's found a new niche I haven't seen yet, and his amazing showmanship with his voice is fantastic. Please continue this!
The way you pronounce elytra is how everyone pronounces it so your not making anybody mad.
The fact that this man can survive 100 days in any Minecraft mode is actually amazing.
WoooOo #1 on trending, Good job!
Amzing
25:00
The nether used to be flat lmao
1000 days when?
What's the point of a pickaxe in superflat.
Yes
I hope that he continues this!
You should do the 200 days I really liked this video it was great, good job
Make more superflat days videos or i’ll make an iron farm
How are you gonna get lava in a super flat world? (To go to the nether and get debris for netherite amour)
I like your worlds
When Luke hit 1 on trending *everyone liked that*
wait every time he has a big dight for the first time "the footage corrupts" it always happens to be on big fights
I comment for 1000 days
He just can survive everywhere
All I hear in this video: *slime*
this man is a jerk he had everyones 100 days videos deleted
I’m confused on why he didn’t make a shield until later
#1 on Trending, congrats!
Finally somebody who understands my hate for slimes
Your persistence and patience should receive an Olympic medal at this point.
This guy makes Minecraft entertaining for some reason😂😂
Yes a New serie 200 days time

he sounds like might guy from naruto
How does he manage to make a world with LITERALLY NOTHING entertaining.
Ikr
Continue the series!
I know this is cheating but with commands you can spawn a stronghold. Only do this when you have 12 eyes if ender and then do it. Or you know you could just /give yourself a bunch of end frames but where’s the fun in that?!
Am just waiting for the 200 days of co-op with the tors
I want to see 200 days
Please do 200 days
Its Solid and Sturdy, unlike ur grandma
100 Raids Customs Escape From Tarkov
When this gets to a thousand days the entire map will probably be made with slime.

Idea when you go to 200 days comit mas genicide on slime and make a huge bouncy castle

Ah yes, netherack for potions
can u do a 100 day creative flat world challenge? that would be kinda cool...
WE WANT 1000 DAYS
Yes
U can't beat the game in a flat world, but U can get beacon
A stronghold does not spawn in 1.16 super flat world but it spawns in the last versions of Minecraft before 1.16
Take a shot everytime he says "Slime"
Ello
Auto bonemeal farm for excess seeds
love your 100 days videos!
Are you planning on doing Halo content when Infinite comes out?
That is flatter than my girlfriend
super cool, i literally had this idea in mind and you made it come true without even me suggesting it, true mind reader
Are you going to do 200 days with the tors?

Next part
13:15 finally some honesty
Java = Village at superflat  Bedrock = Nothing at superflat
Isn’t this the guy that copyrighted this type of content 💀
Now this, this is what we’ve been looking for
try doing an "artificial forest" where you get a bunch of saplings, create some hills and a flowing river, get some flowers and transform a flat world into a semi not flat world, also make 200 days :)
Damnnn nice ive always really wanted someone to do this
wait can u not make an infinite lava source with 2 lava buckets
On the ps4 before the update you can edit the layers in a super flat world. You can have watermelon, pumpkin, dimonds, TNT, basically any block in the game.
This really made me realize how much is possible on a super flat.
Stamps did this first (Joke)
Next part
PLZ do 200 days with tors  LIKE 👍 IF UOU AGREE

Did you know the most effective method for farming is place the water wherever you plan to make the farm then line it out 4 out from the water and fill in the area, it won’t break and it is the longest range you can make it and if you place a slab at the top of the water you can walk over it.

13:47 DAAAAMN! XD
Need 200 days
You might have to just spawn in an end fortress somewhere, I don’t think portals spawn naturally. You could also have Tors spawn a fortress somewhere in the nether. That would be a cool and intense journey trying to find it in a dangerous environment.
#1 on trending?!
Are you gonna make more days
Surely one thousand super flat and three thousand hardcore come out before the end of the year!
Actually cool stuff. Make a castle and I'll sub forever

By 1000 days, you'll probably have carpet in a 500 block radius.
Luke you could do any sort of 100 days and I'm guaranteed to watch it. 100 days with a nether start would be cool
You make a flor carpet your house
200 days with tors?
Do  500 days!
do a skyblock series
Oi
100 Days in Skyfactory 4?
Do mooore daaaaasyyys
PLEASE CONTINUE SERIES
I remember I only used to play on super flat worlds and it was really fun back then.

Oooo 11 hours agoo-
This was painfully amazing
I never heard luke swearing
Do more
I love your Minecraft series, keep doing your thing 👍🏾
So many super-flat videos are going to come out now
8:20 village diamond drops are only 1-3 this chest is possibly staged :(
I want 30000 daya😂😂
"Also killed some baby hoglins because I hátë t h e m!"
My guy really said blackstone fortress,
U can't beat it but u can survive n it
Love when he screams for no reason 😂 “nothing but SILENCE!!!!”
Ooh! maybe you should try "I tried taking a concept from other content creators for 100 days" challenge, I think that would work pretty well.
26:53 Wait.. is that lodestone?! When did he get enough for a netherite ingot?🤔
This 1 on trending
boi im beat your ass if dont do a thousand days of flat world
CHANGE YOUR SKIN
he do be op tho
Luke: glass= more rare than diamond blocks Me: just used trapdoor windows
lol
Its amazing how much you an do on a superflat.
looool gooood vid after a long time cant say ___ _____ u trademarked it
aye luke we need 200
You fell off hard.
More would be great
"planning googling and time also the killing of several slimes" rhymes perfectly
Holy crap #1 trending ;-;
Do 100 days but one block i think thats a good content pls im a big fan
Yes I need this
A more efficient way of farming is to make the water source blocks eight blocks apart. Since saturated soil reaches 4 blocks away from water you can do eight wide farms with the fourth saturated soil blocks from each water source meeting in the middle.
Woah this looks janky
U fell off lol
I did this, but with starter chest so I can have a renewable wood, (saps)
This is my comment there are many like it but this one is mine.
Good
5:50 IM DEAD LOL
Why do you guys still give him view after what he did with the 100 days shit
It’s like the endless ikea but with slimes
there's a way to go to the end in the superplane, it's just you research
Maybe the next 100 days could be amplified hardcore edition
Is anyone triggered that he said "nether rack" instead of "nether wart" at 10:00

Next video idea💡 100 days- (minecraft skyblock) PLEASE
The 👑 returned
Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment 😉
I like to be a nomadic in this style of play, when I find a Village I start looting all their wood and cobblestone, When I have enough I build a base close to a main village and star growing it, and later on doing an Iron farm, it's a Lot of fun, I think it's a challenging play mode.
200 DAYS PLEASE!!!!!
You should do different games like maybe 100 games of valorant, just an idea love your vids tho
at 200 days do: get Netherite tools/armour expand your house and walls uhh expand everything

It’s the slime apocalypses
you should try not being terrible to people who want to make 100 days content btw, you made it, but others can make their own
Subbed, I like your determination and humor man, keep it up!
You should have used slabs for the ground so that they don’t spawn because mobs can’t spawn on slabs
Plz 200 days ???

“The firm clutches of poverty” hit me a different way! 😂

This is awesome
"I dont have my hoes but ive got my bi- witches" -luke 2021         edit: this got like 100 likes in 1 hour thats crazy  thank you
This is epiccccc
luke is very poor to make a wooden house so he made a emerald house
Do 200 days
Definitely please do a 200 days, BEST series behind the normal Minecraft hardcore survival series. LOVE BOTH
ElRichMC made it first, but it was just a gameplay, this one  is another format and it's actually more funny
Luke: Why don’t we just spawn a destructive mob inside of a church? What could go wrong? 😂
Did my man just cuss
i actually call elytra the way you said unironically
You are very lucky guy
In flat worlds it is flat world war slime
100 DAYS OH NOO IM COPYRIGHTED A AGHHHHHZHZB
Jeez all of these comments are sorted by recentness- I enjoy this series but it may slow down the 3000 days.
Day 200?
Day 200
3:01 "I made a sword and a picaxe, I think most of us probably would." He said that on the 100 days and the 2000 or 1000 days.
This dimonds in the village chest was sus
try putting green carpet instead so it look kinda like grass, but i think that's reaally hard to get in superflat
Continue plz
You could have turned on strong holds and mineshafts in your generator settings.   You can probably do that to this world by editing it's level.dat file.
He really said netherack for netherwart?! 9:55
200 days plz☺️
Very Funny Video! 😁
This feels like 2013 Minecraft, so much simpler.
Make a series where u can only breath underwater for 100 days and u lose bubbles on land
The Bone blocks in the Nether is a really good way to get bone meal btw if you do the 200 days!
Continue please I know there isnt an end but imagine you teletport millions of blocks away place the portal there scrap the cords and maybe the eyes will go to it so you can get elytra and pearls easy! also pls continue
Please do day 3000 and great 🎥
Ah yes the rushia world 100 day survival
Pls do 200 days
How is this even possible
You should make a cobblestone generator so you don’t have to use villager houses for stone
-in xbox one edition (1.12) the nether is flat -also u can customize superflats to have up to like 128 layers and customizing each layer to be the block you want (except for the -bottom bedrock layer, thats unbreakable even in creative) -and u can customize the biome to be whatever, and the dimension only changes background to be overworld sky, nether red, or end purple) wow the nostalgia
Yeah we're gonna need more 😆
comment
i need 200 days with tors
YOOOOO
U also gonna claim this idea?
So i get 40 views for this same idea i posted 6 days before this 😂
The most notable thing about Luke is either that he can make 30 minutes to 2 hours straight interesting or that he can always find a way to make profits-
why is every comment posted like.... less than a minute ago
Poor horse
why are all of these comments so recent
Imagine making an illegal monopoly an entire genre of entertainment
Lets go for 1000 days
5:48 killing some bitches
IM SORT OF EARLY
The rude tank pharmacokinetically drag because hospital expectedly enjoy failing a material guide. envious, eatable hole
HELL YEAH THE NOTABLE ONE IS BACK! Can't wait for 3k days in HCMC and 200 days in HCMCSF

200 days with tors
200 days??
A little note - You can get honey by spawing a tree next to a flower, as it has a small chance to spawn a beehive when you do that
why does he always get on trending
As much as I want to see 200 days super flat I want to see 200 days with tors alot more
Anyone wonder how on 24:42 he had no exp? Did he die? Maybe he's using a texture pack that makes all hearts look like hardcore ones. I have a pack like that
slimes when any fence is up: *lemme innn, please. it’s been 2 minutes*
I say elytra the same way you say it
I love vids luke!

"He said im a pedophile. i mean he's not wrong but he has no evidence" MaximilainMus 2021
so what's gonna happen to the regular 3000 days video
I cannot handle how inefficient the farms are you could save so much space with one block of water in the middle of a 9x9 area and planting around it
Good to be back with the og 100 day guy
Anyone else annoyed at luke for not critting the iron golems?
woooo
Luke is one of the few players that doesn't immediately genocide a village
Thanks for the vid
I’m surprised that he didn’t fish at all
I was just rewatching 2000 days and wanted to see 3000 and got my hopes up but this is cool too
#1
I think I remember the old nether being flat 🤔
nice vid
A new series pog!!!
LTN in a flat world: Exists Slimes: *Hippity Hoppity your happiness is now my property*
Couldn't you turn off hostile mob sound so the slimes won't be annoying?
I could watch this for hours. Truly some of the best Minecraft content. I'd watch the whole unedited 100 days ngl.
Little tip I noticed, hoes can now break leaves instantaneously so that should help with a future tree farm
Nobody: Anti vaxxers:
10:01 you mean netherwart?
200 days

Great job on #1 Trending!

Do day 200! I know you can make it!👍I subbed and liked
Hi Luke, this video was sick. If you are willing to continue this series(and i hope you do), maybe you could publish each video with an extra 100 days. For example, instead of doing 100 days, 200 days, 300 days, and then 1000 days, maybe do just increments of 100 days. Thanks
I would love a 200 day vid
S L L I I M M E E  AND P L L A A N  T

Actually, you can use multiple presets for Superflat, but I see you went with the default one.
When you like and comment before even watching the video because it said by lukethenotable
This makes me want 100 days in floating island
XD nice joke now do it on bed rock 😐
yayayaay
keep it going
Is is not called a Blackstone fortress it is a bastion
You should try 100 days in vr minecraft
And now look what everyone else is gonna do
1000
5:48 woah luke calm down
If you tweak the settings of the flat world on the create world you can actually choose to let structures other than the stronghold appear
Stronghold don't spawn in 1.16 super flats but in 1.15 they do
LET’S GO TO A THOUSAND
Take a shot every time he says "slime"
The bite-sized reason morally squash because mechanic speculatively clip upon a puzzling ethiopia. amused, perpetual defense
Him there was no flat nether Me who used to play on xbox 360  Yes there was
on xbox the nether is flat
Wait, how is Elytra actually pronounced???? I say it the exact same way LTN does
Can't wait to see more!
69 funny number
The slimes don't spawn anywhere, they need slime chunks
This reminds me of attack on titan so much
why are there so many comments from like 30 seconds ago?
Wait it's not pronounced eelietra? Wtf?
Oh my god amazing
My new favorite thing to say is “most of us probably would”
you can smelt iron armor and tools into nuggets to avoid killing golems. if you are rich enough it's actually faster than manually farming the golems... though an automatic farm will always be faster than anything you can do manually, but I too feel bad about killing Iron golems on mass so the smelting armor thing is my usual method when I can't mine them.
Luke you should do next video 200 days in hardcore Minecraft flat and say like sub and comment
I would love 200 days
PLEASE CONTINUE THIS SERIES
On XboxOne edition, the nether is flat
The video I didn't know I needed.
Btw its called a blacksmith not a weapon Smith
Why did this remind me of attack on Titans
Wow all the comments were seconds ago XDDD

Idea: Minecraft but only in the nether
Pro tip: for your villager that wanted to be a farmer, if you break the nearby composter(s) they'll change occupation to that of the next nearby workstation (assuming you haven't traded with them yet)
Cool

Yes Luke I do know how that sound drilling it’s way in to your sanity fells... I usually make my homes in swamps cuz the is so many slimes to harvest but they eventually drive you to the point of throwing your character into lava to make it all go away....
Remember when the nether was able to be superflat
fun video, idk if you should continue this world tho you already beat it and you just did the same villager trading thing
So you could’ve used a lead for the boat in the villager 😁 I haven’t watched the whole video so I’m just speaking from near the beginning where you put a villager in a boat 😁
Definitely do 200 days

Luke: “I don’t like being evil” Luke: “randomly starts hitting a cat”

A woman who lost her wedding ring found it 16 years later on a carrot in her garden...
This is a great series. Day 200?

I prefer the real hard, superflat.
Oh wow when did they change nethers on superflat to just normal
If flat , I would rather have 300 straight
Yeah, next time it’ll be amplified world, that one’s really hard.
Fake and gay
Hmm, Cool
Wait I thought elytra was pronounced elytra
So... 200... I'm waiting for 3000 gamer, but yes 200 would be nice

i want it as a series please
Now this is gonna be the 10000 days series
You are pog
I think you planned out everything and took a long time to survive and get recources

Pls continue this siris🙏
Beat minecraft with the most unlucky seed in hardcore
We have a problem,... Luke is a simp.
WHY
I would love to see in 200 days in Superflat that the entire world is covered in carpet. At least the area around the base.
YES but we want 200 days with tors
I still didn't understand how his shovel got repaired automatically while mining dirt at 4:10 see carefully.                                          Edited- Yeah there's a cut if you look carefully
Here before #1 💥
More pls
Do it again
Luke: and I started killing bitches on my land Also Luke: I- I meant witches Btw Luke can you do more flat please
I once played on a world I set to only generate blocks around y 13 and below. Really challenging to get wood (mineshafts save you there if you can find one near the surface) and food other than rotten flesh, and dirt is sparse, but holy cow the ores 😂😂😂
I love “my dad works at minecraft”
wait until I tell Luke about this and takes this down
He does not upload:panik He uploads: kalm He does not upload 3000 days:"panik"
are you sure you said "witches"
I don’t think anyone would have used a world like this guess he is the first one
Great achievement, getting number 1 trending over the perseverance rover landing
Thank you for curing the disease I had called boredom
Weakness arrows
"need to put my  distance to 69"

Did Luke clear all the comments or something? I started watching this video a couple hours ago or so, and there were loads of comments from there too. Ontop of that, most of those comments had like an average of 100 like? Something like that. Strange.
You should play 100 matches of rocket league next
Continue this series
Your skin is a girl
Why all the comments are so recent
Pro tip: make a giant circle made of rails all the way round the village (basically a wall, but with rails) and ravagers (or however are they called, english not my main language) are nor passing thru them for some reason
Nobody:  Luke: *AaH iTs So TrAnSpArEnT*
Love the 100 days please do 200 days

i feel like this should be on r/madlads
Writing comment
200
Slime rancher sequel lookin real fire.
You could also do floating islands survival , where the over world has end like generation, although a lot of the game play is similar to this series.
how about 3000 days for your other world?
200 days
200
Horse :(
200 days! This was chaotic in the best way possible
The worst part is at 30:00
10:00 is that a Texture pack you've got on the "Netherrack"
Not as great as the og. But still amazing
BOIS IM HERE NEW VIDEO WOOHOO
200 days here we come
Why were you trying to kill a cat
100, 20 minute Minecraft days adds up to  *33 hours real time*
far lands survival!
Luke have you ever heard of turning off hostile mob sounds?
Congrats on number one trending for gaming
nice sweater
5:24 "no slimes you can't get some because you don't have rights".
YES
sorry Luke, in a superflat world there is no end.
Yaya
You should’ve made it a green carpet
Who is still watching it
200 days???
1000 or 200
"just killing some bitches ... i - i meant witchs"
If you put carpet around a village except for a patch of land and do a raid. Would the raiders just spawn in that area? And could you make a raid farm out of it?
The bright soda ethnopharmacologically punish because motorboat coincidingly groan athwart a absorbing scorpio. elastic, wiry loss
Yoooo! It's been so long since people have done real super flat survival! People cheat and do the super flat that generates up to y60 spawning everything underground that undermines the challenge of super flat. Glad I get to see it again!
I love these ❤️
5:45 I’ve never heard u cuss lol
Flatter than ur mom
He made it so it’s at newest he knows he messed up
I want more flat minecraft
The abject reason electronmicroscopically use because cap allegedly entertain underneath a abnormal stove. delightful, well-off anthropology

"I started the day by killing bitches... i mean witches" -Luke TheNotable
If only village spawn in bedrock(flat world) only bedrock user knows
This is a good idea and I think you should continue :)
And 3000 days hardcore can't wait and keep up the good work
You can see how he slowly descends into madness from the slimes.      *DAMN YOU!! YOU GREEN PILES OF SLUSH*

the wandering trader came in handy before we got 200 days with tors...let that sink in
Elytra is pronounced that way
Please continue this series
I love it
Fun fact: the nether actually DID used to be flat in older versions, but at some point (I don't know when lol) they turned it back to normal on super flat world.
Cool  I wait for 3000 day or 200 day with tors but i get this
Maybe you can install a mod where you can kill the enter dragon
This is ok, but 200 Days Multiplayer has been delayed for too long.
Awesome stuff keep it up
Thought the nether would be flatter...
U can’t get coal in super flat  Me BREH WITHER SKELETONS

I have idea for next 100days try 100days in New 1.17 snapahot that will be cool
An Spanish youtuber did the same thing some time ago  According to him, the most dangerous thing are the slimes, he stopped them from spawning using water
Plz do 200days
please do this with your wife i would love to see it
#1 on trending
Me and Luke were synced when we looked at the blacksmiths lava.
LTN is a simp
3/10 video was a bit flat
I don’t think there will be a Minecraft 3000 days anymore because of 1.17 the deepest you can go in 1.17 is -64 and 1.16 is 1 so if you play it now there is going to be be a lot error until Mojave make a fix
I found the least amount of materials neccecary to get full diamond. 1 block of dirt 1 ice and lava 2 blaze rods (or 1 blaze rod and 1 powder) 1 sapling 1 brown mushroom 1 sugarcane Now you could cut some materials but that makes the challenge longer :) its pure agony to play so i suggest going to a more normal sky island.
he cant win in super flat bc theres no end portal
You are the notable player❤️
LOL i had just thought of this last week XD but also a desert it is possible dead bushes spawn and they give sticks XD
Hi
...
LTN: " Got two skulls which means one more and  i"m fighting William" Me:What
Hahaha why there's almost no like in comments XD

He's done the impossible
This I thought was impossible!
this might be a good series, but without the end dimension, it's just lacking. I'd rather prefer the 4000 days in the Hardcore World rather that Hardcore Superflat.
1000 days please!
Do another tors mincraft
Next in this super flat try to replicate the emerald tower that you had in 1000 days
Its funny how he used a girl in the thumbnail

You can customize the presets, by picking the one you want and then writing in the text or it what you want for the levels. Like 5*dirt:minecraft (I forget something like that)
Yesssssssssssssssasssss
Doing something stupid like this back in 2017 and seeing someone recreate it is a miracle  Though, like 4 years ago I did it with another person who I don't talk to anymore
I think you can actually find fortresses floating above ground in a superflat world, seen them in this state before.

This is interesting
Fun Fakt: 60% of the werld doe'snt know how two spel the werd notabul

"I made a sword and a pickaxe, I think most of us probably would." NOSTALGIA
i didn't expect a super flat world containing this enormous amount of diamonds
This came at the perfect time.  Thank you, Luke
Wait elytras not pronounced that way?( ._.)
I can’t wait for hardcore day 3000
I used to do this all the time as a kid

"Firm clutches of poverty" xD
This reminds me of stampys superflat sieries
I'm a tad bit late, but a grand idea is to buy a bunch of iron armor and tools, if you melt them down you get nuggets, then turn nuggets into ingots. Sure, it takes 6 million years, but, potentially unlimited iron?
This feels like the original series but the lite version, anyone else? lol
Do more!!!!

I don't know if you can do it anymore but you could make a super flat world where you make one layer of lava at the lowest layer, above that a lava layer, then like 20 plus layers of tnt. Then you just got to survive
Did you run out of video ideas

Do more 200 hundred days super flat pls🙏
I CANT BELEIVE THIS I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BECA BAD EPISODE BUT YOU MAKE EVERYTHING GOOODDDDDD
You say that the slimes noises are annoying you, there is a section in audio which lets you turn down the hostile mobs volume, which doesn’t let you hear it anymore.
Guess what Luke, I’m eight on 13+ content, but I’m a big girl so.. who cares and I used Luke’s joke srry
as soon as he reached day 21 he is no longer surviving.... but hes *living*
You can set the superflat worth to earth which means there is stone and it goes deep and also has ores, Trees are still only at villages.
Notable 👌
20 slimey sheep, in the next episode you should get 100
:)
What’s funny is that they removed strongholds spawning on super flat worlds in 1.16

GASP
Where's the 200 Days?
Honestly the slime house is pretty cool, add some textures with stone along with the slime blocks and maybe use honeyblocks as well !! it would look really cool :)
“An infinite netherrack farm.” “Ya know what, i don’t think that can even exist.” Correct
The video nobody wanted but the video everyone deserves.
Continue this pleaseeeee
this might be an awesome sires
I love watching these because it's stuff I'll never be able to do in Minecraft!
Did you find lava?
Hi there hello
i love this pls sub to luke thenotable <3
Please do 200 days
If luke play in 1.15 stronghold will spawn in superflat world,if only he read this
o.O

Well i dont think he will make 3000 days
shesh that must be super hard
why am i seeing 1sec or 1 minute ago when it was posted 9 hours ago??
i am in love with luke 😳
Hey luke I love the vid keep it up but uhh is there any part 2 of you and tors surviving 200 days?
Please fight the end dragon
YESSSS CANT WAIT FOR MORE, LETS GO LUKE
What happened to 3,000 days?
btw luke the strongholds wont generate because you need to put it in the customize superflat generation section where you can choose any blocks, building generation, or biome to survive in with the superflat. hope this helped a little because i dont really know how to work the superflat generation. i only know that you can customize it. anyways good luck on 200 days!
There is a end in super flat
Yep killing b/tches
Great series
Hi
Pls make 200 hundred days
Yeet squid chicken with chicken

JOE MAMA

That's alright Luke I always thought it was said E-lie-trah or just the way u say it
Pls 200 days
e
Why are the comments so new?
Dude i think in p.e you dont have wood haha no villages
i like it
I would love to see this series continue
99 days you did not record one day
I like subscribed with notifications on because you are the best Minecraft player ever 😁
POGGGGGGGGG
If you were in a hardcore world that you spent a long time in would take a instant damage 2 potion without armour to save your dog
I think you can change the setting and make strongholds spawn. if not i think everyone would be happy if you just spawned in one or an end portal, because it would mean more days :)
Please do a 200 days!... love your content trying to be a YouTuber too!! You have helped me a lot!
please
Nether wart is now called nether rack if you know you know XD

What a madlad.
Please continue this series!
Lol
5:52 made me laugh
Yay!
Who else thinks he is the best YouTuber
first
Wait. . . It’s not pronounced elytra? (E lie tra) How the hell is it pronounced then?
You should probably spawn in an end portal. Yes it's technically cheating but it's justified cheating because there is no end portal im n superflat.
Poooog
Do it for 200 days
I want to hundred days soon some time
200 days?
Please do a 200 days pretty please
Did anyone hear him say netherack in stead of netherwart at 10:00
Claim your 'Here before 1 million views' ticket here!
When is 200 days you and tors coming out also awesome video it’s so good I hope 200 flat world comes out someday too
Maybe try Skyblock
please, do the 200 day super flat
The only way to actually go to the end in a superflat is to be on 1.14 which sucks. If you actually wanted to go to the end in that superflat, you would need to spawn in end portal frames by using commands which I don't think Luke wants to do.
5:49 I heard         Witches
Rip Jerry     Only captain sparkles Fans will get this
8:22 dude, u sure you can get that amount of diamonds in a village chest? I don't think so. The max I ever ever found was 3 or 4, I have played minecraft for 5-6 years.
You already know we want 200 days Luke.
fun fact:This is a Superflat world. Theres no Stronghold in Superflat world so why LTN get blaze rod?

IT IS PRONOUNCED ELYTRA
Previous hardcore worlds:   Cutting trees, making walls and tunnels.  This Hardcore world:    SLIMEEES!!! And more slimes.

I love your commentary, genuinely funny

There’s a mod you can install so you can play in the onion and you do things normally underwater but if you out of water you take damage from lost air. I hope someday you try 100 days of something like thid
Good Job

200 days
This is what you have been making lmao
I've always played and super flat Worlds For redstone stuff but I never thought it was possible to beat it especially and hardcore! Luke you a god
now this, this is epic.
Hey Luke I really like your videos hope you have a great day keep up the great work
Luke on day 91: tors said she liked the dirt ceiling   Me: SIMP ALERT SIMP ALERT ABORT THE MISSION
How are you gonna beat it without the end
This villagers bread and they started reproducing faster then your mom   -luke
“Get out of bed Timmy or I'll kill your parents”
5:06 infinity enchantment for bow
“killing *itches oh wait i ment witches”
Hey man, sorry to tell you so late but I actually copyrighted the number 7, I'd suggest you take this video down and remove the number or I will be sending you an angry email AND telling my mom. Thank you.
We love you luke. take a break if you need it
who is torus and why are you a simp
This was so enjoyable
Luke should do a 100 days where each day his fov goes up by 1 each day
I have an idea what if instead of going for 100 days at a time what about 150 days at a time so then two episodes will be 300 days just an idea oh and continue the series it’s really fun to see how you can actually survive in a flat world
I dont mean to ruin this but the diamonds he found at 8:18 were fake  In villages you can only find a max of 5 which is EXTREMELY rare.  In the video he found 6 in one chest.  Kind of ruins the surprise of diamonds in a blacksmith...

When the new cave and cliff update comes out, you should do 100 days hardcore in that one!
i like how the sheeps have a better place to "work" than the villagers

coment
Only Minecraft Java Can Do This
I made a flat world with my friends and said it would be fun if ltn made a 100 days on it And here we are
200
S I M P
Finally im here for a vid that is knew
As 2000 other YouTubers make the same video because this one was made by LTN and got popular.
First of all, a flat nether DOES exist in the XBOX 360 Version. Second, why.
Can you pls do a 100 days in bedrock edition! please :D
Tip for LTN: You can put torches in your off-hand so you don't have to switch inventory slots.
Bro all you have done is cause drama and ruin youtubers content
Nice enchanted compass?
Only LTN can make a super boring word generation into an interesting one

Found out the hard way I don’t have notifications on for LTN 😭
Pro tip: slimes are attracted to iron golems.

200 days
Hi
The amount of time these videos must take is insane, but they are so very entertaining
at 10:00 minutes he says netherack instead of netherwort
Random fact: There’s a super flat nether on the Xbox 360 version
suggestion: 100 days skyblock
No ones gonna talk about how he got like what 6 diamonds in a chest??
do more pls
“I’v just come to really like the bedrock flooring. It’s solid and sturdy, unlike your grandma.” Ouch that hurt
MORE MORE !!!
i can’t believe he’s not uber powered for a little bit
Make pt 2 plz
Why you got angry in 26:07
Why so many slimes
Look at this madlad
Here is my comment for 200 super flat days.
I want to see 3000 days on your 2000 days hardcore
“Next time in super flat” Luke decides to make a doomsday machine in an attempt to vaporise all slimes in the world but if he does he will also vaporise the entire world     Don’t ask why I did this I just did
Do more
there was glass *AND INFINITY*
1000 please!!!!!!
That was super good👍 Do 200 days of super flat
Where 3000 days hardcore at Luke
Alternatif tittle : minecraft: world after rumbling (flat)
Do a 200 day super flat
You mean nether warts?
I had no funkin idea you cused
Who hasn't thought of actually playing a flat world, great idea from great creator nice job
we need 200 days with tors
Luke: “but this is Minecraft hardcore Superflat, it’s not about vanity”  Me: *y e t*     Edit: something random, why do i feel like Luke and Adam (from somethingelseyt) would be best friends? Lol
Day one of asking him to do 100 days of bedrock
I liked this challenge I wanted to do it before but now that I know I have a challenge like the wither I can see how to beat the game in flat world
Great story  Slimes have taken over the world and eaten everything except for a few villages  And we sent one man to stop it            Stay notable
For 200 days let tors make a buired end portal so u can fight drangon on day 200
The snotty good-bye tribally stain because timer univariately vanish midst a mighty kamikaze. red, peaceful pants
Can you do a 200 days with tors pls  I love the 100 days with tors it is so cool UwU
can't believe you trademarked  "100 days" trend, so scummy, you should be so embarrassed
OH MY GOD YEEEEEEEEEEEES
Where is the 3000 days my son
I honestly like this more than any other playthrough because here it becomes really hardcore with getting certain resourses and it is very enjoyable to watch so i would love to see 200 or even 1000 days of this
If I had to deal with the slimes I would put string on every block in a 5 mile radius.
Ah yes netherrack my favorite potion item
Can agree, killing Piglin children does make one feel better
Lmao he called nether wart "netherrack"
Ah crap here we go again
beans
this makes me wanna do a hardcore super flat now
You can find the end portal by walking around for a while and you will notice that there is a end portal room just floating in the sky.  Edit: oh I’m so sorry guys it’s just that nifty smith did this and he found a end portal room floating... so that’s that’s why I thought that
the farthest I have got in a superflat is leather armor lol
Luke:I'm going to kill bitches  1 second after that:I meant witches
I hope you don't only do Minecraft content for the views, as I know it can sometimes be boring having to put so much time into something you have no interest in.
theyre called bastions not blackstone fortresses
I would absolutely love for a 200 Days of this
"But tors said she likes it so its staying" But would'nt that make you A SIMP??
PLEASE I NEED 200
MORE,,,
The Nether Used to be flat
k, also turn off newest first
loved it
If l ever did this challenge l will not be able to do what you did
O
Only thing that is super flat here is that chest.
this is really fun to listen to wile cleaning because you explain everything, thanks for motivating me to do my cleaning
Me when the video ends   Alright time to be depressed now cause no more video
Luke u can put slabs on your property so that the slimes don’t spawn pls like so that luke can see!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA🤣
Pog
Pog
here's a suggestion; you should make a withered skeleton farm, this is where you will  get coal.
typed this 7 hours after video was made
Part 2:200 days  I want to see you suffer  I mean I want to see good comtent
Nice!
I now relize you could actually survive on superflat
Next, 100 days skyblock
The amount of slimes that are in a flat world is Ridiculous
are you trademarking playing on a flat world?

He forgot to put in the description that this was inspired by luke the notable
Yes  let's get 200 days
The nether used to be flat in that mode
He said netherack not netherwart anyone else catch that?!
Subscribe or nothing will happen

The cartographer gives you glass pains for the second level
Anyone remember when the nether was flat in superflat world back in like, 2015, it also may have only been on console.
Sick
Why didn’t you do one stick per emerald, instead you did one wool per emerald?
Yes
Hi
200 days please it's so fun to watch
Ok this is my new most watched video

Whaaaaat?
Do 200 days on flat Minecraft hard-core
Great video. I loved it
the el chapo tunnels
moAR!!
Continue
more pls 200 days
Eye of Enders doesnt do anything in superflat since structures like the Mansion, Jungle Temple, Dessert Temple and Stronghold doesnt exist only Villages
MORE!!!!!
Wtf is this it’s so cool
And til this day no-one knows what happened on day 28.
Supporting comment for part 2
Why would you torture yourself playing superflat
Well you cant go to the end without cheating, beacouse strongholds dont spawn,  so maybe you can throw like 64 diamons into lava so that you can enter the end
DAY 200!!!!!!
more >:(
If you continue, you can use villager trading to get glass, lanterns, andesite, clay bricks, quartz, bookshelves, glowstone, campfires, etc - which makes life a lot easier! Also buckets of cod for water buckets, could be useful  EDIT: I see you got the glass!
better than best
Now this. Was epic
More please
Luke make the floor of your base out of slime so that you will take less fall damage.
Since when u curse
._.
New series???
Plz a new 3000 mine craft hard core or 200 days flat

200 days
The king is back
I want to see him build his own mountains when he eventually reaches 1000 days 😭
Just helping the algorithm
no
After this series you should do it on an amplified world!
This really is a classic RPG world, flat world, slimes everywhere, villages are your only safe space and adventuring is the only way to get most things.
Pls do a 200 days with the tors plssssss
Luke’s vids are great
Luke: Hey hey, some netherrack, I can use this for potions.  Me: you mean nether wart
You should do 100 days of making a Minecraft island 🏝

This is confusing me lol
Definitely want to see more of the super flat, but has he posted 3000 yet? Anyone know if he died??
I hope Luke does not want this to be a replacement for 3000 days
Lol
At the section of 98th day...... Yes plz 200 days hehe JUST DO IT

Ltn are you making a netherite beacon for 3000 days
Does anyone seem to notice how he called nether wart 'netherrack' at 10:00
We got a new series WOOHOO!!!!!
Plez continue this series
hello dad
100 DAYS OF SKY BLOCK yoooooooo! That would be sick
Claim your “here before 1M” award:
You should do 100 days sky block
Out of curiosity, is there a reason you needed to grab lava outside of the nether after building the portal? Ah I was only half way through the video, you do get it from the nether around day 80, m'bad.
You should do 100 days one block hardcore. I saw someone do 100 one block. But I think you should do it on hardcore
Uh
subscrebe
FINALLY!!!!
I'm early let's gooooo
Here before million views
PART 2
Does anything other then tors 200 days lol
“I started day 20 by killing b****s  I...I meant witches” lol man I laughed so hard
the way he treks out off his camp on horseback surrounded by hostiles reminds me of aot
In the xbox 360 edition the nether IS flat
Luke how about the 3000 days on that big town you now the E town
At firs a thought this video was a joke but   i was wrong
... Fantasy Violence Violent References Suggestive Themes Crude Humor... ,"Killin Bitches in my yard." yea ok bud I'm unsubbing
Who thinks there will be 200 days
Sorta wish you hadn’t copyrighted “100 days”
Dude.................     Not cool.
Luke thenotable said bitches
Every time I watch one of your videos I want to do 100 days in Minecraft but then I give up since I don't have patience :)))))
Day 3 of asking LTN to do a 100drops in Fortnite
Keeep it going from Notalbe hearth
Where 200 days with the tors! 😭
Pls more this series is COOL
I AGREE I WOULD love to see more of this
Do 200 days!?
Hey guys just respond with something like Sango’s
Thanks for featuring me luke. 💛
Comment
Finally Luke we have been waiting for another 100 days video!
You should make a green-screen room out of maps
11:33 how is it really pronounced?
I would love to see more of this! Anyone else agree? 🙏🙏    Also I know in 1.15 a stronghold is possible, but I don't think they have it in 1.16. I'm sure you could find something that allows one to spawn in 1.16.
Google says u can go to end if u had strong holds enabled 🤷‍♂️apparently
Nether update might have made superflat nethers impossible but I remember playing superflat and having a superflat nether too. so 1.16 made them impossible or console likes superflat nethers.
I WAS LIKE " WAAAaaaaAaaaa HE CURSED?!?!? I THOUGHT THIS WAS FAMILY FRIENDLY!?!
Tors 200 days plz
Ive played survival on a flatland before and getting sugarcane from a wandering trader took over 7 days irl
Luke starting another series makes me even sadder that tores 200 days is slowly getting out of the video ideas
Luke this idea is freaking great. I never thought I'd be so curious of super flat before til you made this. Kudos on your beacon. You're a god once more lol
Like if LTN is good
You can make a wither skeleton farm for coal
small slimes dont attacl but medium and big that attack
*8:03*  *Luke Trying To Kill The Cat* Cat: Get TF away from me
Pog
200 days with the tors?
my friend luke thenotable is cracked at minecraft my guy and he is taken
Early pog
The future: i survived 2000 days superflat hardcore
Do 100 hardcore days at the nether.
Pog

Looking forward for 1000 days superflat
This man does better in 52 days in a super flat then I do on a regular world
Part of timmy I'm laugh then my brother watch timmy

I hope u have a notable day too
I'm not afraid of anything but that thing *insert slimes* it scares me....
I really liked this one
I love you
I'm 9 opps
Epix
Dude love your vids
*exciting*

You should make a end portal on your own
I wish I Could play flat world on survival but I’m a switch player so...I want have Villages on my flat worlds... :( I don’t have hardcore mode... :( because it for Computer players.
This hit #1 on trending quicker than my dad left to get milk
Holy crap this man has a lot of patience
Why your voice sounds like one from tik tok voice changer? The funniest one which gives like the waves from up to down
1k please
Assasasasasasaasasasassasasasaasassaasassasasasaass
11:33 wait its not pronounced like that-
slime rights NOW!
Two on trending
"I dont like killing them!"   WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
When i saw the title i wondered "How could he survive in superflat" and well... you did amazing, i think it would be interesting if you went to 1000 days superflat but then it might get boring. Also, normal hardcore will never be boring!
Everyone: Yay he posted!  Me: wait you can put a enchantment on a compass??
Do more or you will be no more
Netherack?
ok but 3000 days
literally every second somebody posts a comment
I would absolutely want you to keep doing this
hi
100 days hardcore nether survival only???
U should do 100 days stardew valley no fainting like hardcore stardew valley
You should have played on a older version because flat worlds used to have lava pools
very good video
Ive done this challenge before but i died because of an iron golem😅
Do another video on this.
I thought it was pronounced elytra this whole time-
200 day!
Have a notable day
11:31 wait how do you say elytra cause that's how i've been pronouncing it...
Can you do 200 days.
wat
I don't understand why he calls It hard core Minecraft when if he dies he loads the world back up from a save? That just defeats the point
Can we just respect that the video is EXACTLY 30 minutes long?
This comment informs you that I have liked the video and I was subscribed to the channel before you even released this video.   And now I have written a comment.   So make me a new video entertainment giver. Do it now!
200 days plz
Minecraft be like: why. Why you do dis
E
Anyone catch when he said “I hope it’s all over soon just like my life”
You too
Y do u alternate the farm?
.
Two words: two hundred
How are you supposed to pronounce elytra
We are gonna need 200 Days.
do you sprint ?? it doesn’t look like your sprinting
Hi
Did anyone notice that luke said "poglin"?
pog
This was so such a good video. The reason I found it so interesting was because it is something that isn't really done that often.
Super flat and  village is flat
Make 200 hundred days plz
Great video
*Minecraff*
When are you going to make the 3000 days in hardcore Minecraft
It is pronounced el-i-tra
100 bad days makes a hundred good storys
How about sky islands if this reach 2000 day please make it
9:59 "Hey hey netherack!"   everyone: ASODJOAJFI YOU SAID IT WRONG AAAAAAA-
I didn’t even know that you could make it that far
200 days tors?
Why is he never sprinting?
“It’s day 4 and I’m not dead yet and I have A BUCKET”
Nobody: Trump: 2:26
Luke does better in a superflat than I do in a normal world
Can’t subscribe if u already subscribed
"I'm gonna make it out of emerald, if you don't like it then you are still in the clutches of poverty" Goddamn luke
isnt this the man that copyrighted 100 days?
why have you trademarked  this it wasn’t even your idea
please
I NEED MORE
Amazing video--I wish I could like twice
How on earth did he actually beat the wither like if you agree
please just do a 1000 day on this world
5:51 ;)
Luke I just realised you could make a lava moat around your base to keep slimes away
The hallowed hour expectantly remove because flock perceptually miss besides a cut gore-tex. terrible, opposite delivery
YESSIR
Can we have 200 days soon please?
I think you should continue it, it adds a nice twist to minecraft
You should just put an end portal down in creative then go back to hard core
Pls do 3000 days
Do 200 Days
I real thought it said 3000 days
what about 100 days with tors?   just please i am begging
You can buy some of that podzol from the wandering trader to make a brown mushroom farm (just make an area with the podzol and plant the mushroom on top).          It will help to make more potions
I bet u can make an art with a map in a superflat world-
I pronounce it ee-lie-tra
We really need him to have a VERY NOTABLE SKIN
Thank you for proving my flat earth theory
amplified world
Makes sense just find a village
Please do 200 days with the Tors
lets go.  i think you should make the goal of this series to get every item you can. some you cant like sand but try your best!   this will need much research and a bunch of community engagement so this will be the best thing possible in my opinion. also it *IS* pronounced ely -truh
Serie
200 dayssss
100 days slime rancher
what if you did 100 days in the nether?
You need to do 200 days plz

Sometimes I like to think that this is attack on titan and the mobs were titans and the creepers were the colossal titan
The old nether (before 1.9) was flat in superflat.
more pls
Make it a series and good luck with 3000 days
This is such a cool series continue making these videos!!

very impressive
Watching him bunny hop without sprinting makes me want to die
luke plays 1000s of days and still doesn’t have a skin
I wa't more yeey
Instead of using a name tag, you can give a zombie a tool or piece of armour and it won't despawn. It's easyer.
I can’t wait for 200 days
what if you did 2000 days in a superflat world lol
How much a barb 100 days in a flat land but in the but in a diamond completely diamond survival 100 days in a diamond and a flat land
i didn't see village in the flat... first time i saw village in the flat in your video.
"it's not about vanity" welp, we know where this is gonna go fast.
simp
@Luke TheNotable  It's now time to do "100 days in hardcore real life"
“Though you’re going to have to steal from the villagers.” That’s like all I ever do anyway😂
i love this
I need 200 days
Haha coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool Luke starting another series
Lukethenotable aka the stick tycoon
I hit the like button and subscribe I think most of us probably would
5:52 OMG Y U SAY THE BAD WERD      joke btw
Yes
There is a setting in super flat worlds to spawn strongholds
Old superflat worlds used to have a flat nether. At least on ps3/Xbox 360
HOOWWWW MAN HOWWW DID YOU GET DIAMOND ARMOR ON A BLACKSMITH
at least im gonna be here for a bit, please continue this
Yes 200 days of this or even more would be awesomely
Can I get top comment? I started my super flat series 2 weeks ago! 🤍
nice so cool👍👍👍👍👍👍😍😍😍
Commenting so ltn will continue the series
Nice
We need more
Love this video
What seed is that?
more
why is all the comments from few sec and min ago
this is actually an intresting idea, but 1000 days would be too much since the limits of what you can do, but it would be intresting to see 200 / 300 days
Instead of stopping at 1000 days you should stop a 690
THIS IS BIG
MOREEEEEEEEEEEE
awesome idea
Please continue. It’s so interesting to see how you overcome being in a super flat
why is it set on newest first ;-;
How are we all here-
Awesome video man. Quick question, how’d you get your compass to glow like that?
You could’ve used 2 water to make infinity water ???    Edit : i am not hating on this dude, he is epic
Great minds think a like I started my super flat series about 2 weeks ago! Sadly mine won’t do half as good as yours! Great video keep it going! 🤍
FINALLY ORIGINAL 100 DAYS
How did u get a netherite ingot??? u hav a lodestone compass and if u want to craft a lodestone u need netherite

The cowardly crown mainly file because parsnip repressingly decay amid a deafening sardine. rapid, graceful badge

“and killing bitches on my land” -LTN

It’s kinda funny when he says nether rack instead of nether wart
Continue he series pls

You get get bonemeal from bone blocks that spawn in the nether! They give you 9 bonemeal each. Like so he sees!
He should make a slime farm to get revenge

i watched tis the day you made it lol haha
Y E S

Do more or slimes will kill us all

10:00 Hey HEY some “netherack”.    you’ll never find that anywhere else in the nether. Such a rare find lol. I’m just joking I loved the video 👍
You should place buttons or slabs around your compound, it keeps things from spawning.
what happened to that 100 days controversy?
I’ve said elytra like that forever, how is it supposed to be said?
Sometimes Ancient debris, or even Netherite ingots spawn in bastions! That way u could get netherite tools or armor?
How did he get diamonds?
Why didn't you make a sheild?
No matter how many other people make these types of videos....yours will always be 100x better!
Did he just say BLACKSTONE FORTRESS!?
You should continue the series
1000 Days?!
Use creative for the end portal
Luke is multitasking. He's doing 3,000 day hard-core and 200 day superflat

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!

The nether used to be flat. The last time I remember it was on Xbox 360 before the Xbox 1 came out
Every video he seems to become more insane.
This is the comment so u continue this series!!!!!
Keep going big fella
The bedrock wither will be way harder to fight if you were in hard difficulty-
I cant wait for when Luke cant help but make a farm so large it fills the whole screen.
plz continue plz yoo gutso
If ur lucky enough to find obsidian, you can get an infinite cobblestone source via lava from the nether. I dug out a huge lake in my super flat survival
200 DAYS!
Yyyyyyyyyyyyyess
Lol what YouTube setting does Luke have on, why are all the top comments the newest with 0 likes
200 days!!!! Plz luke😂😂😂😂😂love superflat
Request rl craft
200 days plz this so different from all let's plays I have ever watched
If this man does 2000 days he should try and spend a lot of days to make all the villages he finds play the floor is carpet
Keep doing this it’s well the normal hardcore day but harder since you can’t get much things but I bet next your gonna get netherite items
What were you going to say at the end stay whattt
Me: why make yourself suffer in minecraft  Luke: yes
Coment
End of the fortnite season soon you might want to make a video
200 days now
Coooool!!!
He called a bastion a blackstone fortress... He called nether wart nether rack.... He called a stronghold an end fortress...  My ears have never been in this much pain before
Ya do 200
Can someone explain to me  how this already has 1002k likes, and 502,000 views? Your videos are awesome btw, Im a big fan
When will 200 days be with the tors
please do a 1000 days in super flat!!!!!!!!
but.. it is called elytra
I liked, I subbed, I commented, and I watched this twice so I am notable like my god Luke.
200 daysss!!!
why
didnt even know super flat survival was a thing
Luke where’s 3,000 Days???? :(
I actually did this on Minecraft xbox 360 a few years ago with some friends. We managed to get saplings from a village and made a small but intensely curated tree farm.
is it only me who never knew you could cook with a fire bucket?
didnt expect it on superflat i immediately had to watch it as i saw it ^^  and i gotta say you really achieved something there :D
Surprised you didn't set up a wither skeleton farm to get coal.
who else think he should try “i get all achievements in 100 days”
why are all these comments so recent-
yesssssssssssss
If you want a super flat nether, hope on PlayStation, create a super flat world, and go to the nether. Unfortunately there’s nothing there so you can’t beat the game on a super flat world, but it’s still pretty dope.

How did you get a VILLAGE??
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
SUBSCRIBE TO LUKE THE NOTABLE
love this 200 days plez
You are copying the guy who did 100 days, so I gotta dislike
I play super flat survival on bedrock. You can get most things thanks to the nether, wandering traders, and villager trades
Love this!
Why did he use his iron on a pickaxe in a 3 block deep world?  theres nothing to mine edit:  WHY DID HE USE DIAMONDS ON A PICKAXE AND THEN ENCHANT IT?
WOH, I just watched the entire normal hundred days
11:15 ah yes, that precious lava. not like you just visited a dimension full of it
PLSKAKSJAK
You can smelt iron armor for iron nuggets
Is their still gonna be a 3000 this and days in his main world
Noice vid
pls continue
yes yes yes yes yes
Petition for 1000 days super flat
5:51 b*tches?

This is so creative I don't think anyone expected a 100 days on super-flat, keep on making awesome content Luke
This is QUALITY
Hii
Well this was unexpected
mm
*copyrights flat worlds*
With the amount of slimes I would have thought that this is 3d terraria
Video we didn’t know we needed
Cool 😎
Please do more I love tho concept
This came out four hours ago. Why are all the comments from less than an hour ago?
Cant wait for 200 days supersflat, 200 days with tors and 3000 days hard core
You like profits so much, you're like If apple was a minecraft player
You can actually get iron by smelting iron armor/tools, it gives iron nuggets, which if you put 9 of in a crafting tabel, you can make ingots. Same with gold
Loved this
what are you talking about luke you made a sheep farm in 2000 days
10000 days in superflat
Wait its not pronounced e-lie-tra???
Flat
How are you gonna do 3000 days and 1000 days of flat
poggers
Didn't even do the end even tho it's a floating stronghold in the air
3000 days!!!
thanks for the idea
5:51 Lmfao.
Bro screamed when i realized i wasnt subscribed
Did he call Netherwart Netherrack on purpose or..... 😂
Omg Luke saying "**tches i meant witches" was completely unpredictable
200 days?
Did you die on normal hardcore?
10:05 ahh yes i love netherack in my potions
Wow
Is this proof that the earth is flat?
5:50 I said wow o
didn't know I needed this but now I know I do
You should definitely continue this, Luke! It's amazing so far!
I wonder what a 1000 days video for this series would be like?
.
Luke in first 80ish days: I HAVE NO LAVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Me: *narrows eyes* Me: *goes through nether portal* Me:*sips coffee as I stare at the vast sea of lava*
Watch in 200 most likely there is going to be another Emerald tower
can you get sugarcane from wandering traders? and why where they so rare for you?
i cant even get wood
Does tis mean normal hardcore playthrough is done.
I really wish you did podcast because I rarely watch your video but listen to them because of your voice sorry but your content is notable like you
Banana
“Get out of the bed Timmy or I’ll kill your parents.”
Very notable 100 days we gonna see another 100?
i know you did not mean to cuss luke but there are 3 year olds watching this video bro not cool and i'm 7 years old
hi LTN
10:10 collecting nether wart hey hey some nether rack
Strongholds don't spawn in 1.16 Minecraft. If you want to get to tge end, you have to play in 1.15.
Hey look! Its the guy who tried copyrighting the phrase "100 Days Survival"
Wait how.....
Pls do 200
10:00 okay then.
You can smelt tools in a blast furnace for a nugget if u get enough u can get ingots no need for an iron farm
Day 20 was a good day killed some bitches I meant witches 🤣🤣🤣
You can smelt tools in a blast furnace for a nugget if u get enough u can get ingots no need for an iron farm
In legacy and Microsoft the nether is flat.
Nice
This guy is insane at Minecraft
Simp
Try bedrock edition.   Villages don’t generate.
you can find an end portal if you have strongholds enabled
I remember when stampy did this when I was little, the nostalgia...
You need to do 201 days you know cause you can
look at me I copyrighted an entire subgenre of Minecraft.
I remember when in the xbox minecraft there was a superflat nether
Make 200 days with the tors

Luke so when you post 3000 days in minecraft that will be cool keep up good work luke
First time I heard him curse
Do 200 days of hardcore minecraft pleas on the flat world
Like the women try to seduce you   Flat!
do 200 days for this and then do 3000 days for your normal hardcore one when you did 2000 days
I was sick and this cheered me up.
why is "hey hey i found some netherrack" the most grr thing ive ever heard
200 days!!!
Love the vid bro, always happy for some more Minecraft content from you.
Lmfao he tried trademarking the whole “100 days” thing.
Wow,this guys has the best voice in the word!!!!

Continue it
I actually don’t know how he made superflat survival interesting
A comment
"killin bitches" caught me off gaurd lol
you should survive 100 days in a floating islands world -
OK, I definetly wasn't ready for that!
It’s fake
You can get iron nuggets by smelting armor and tools
Getting some arrows AND KILLIN BICHES I see you have learned cursing Luke,good job
Yesssss i have a superflat world that I played in survival on for many hours back years ago, its probably still on my old pc now ima find it.
They reproduced faster than my mom🥲
Please 200 days
Go to 300!
Omg
when will your next fortnite vid be
LOL he said killing bitches at 5:50
“Witches i ment witches”  😂😂😂
NOTE! before you try to do this, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT IN SUPER FLAT WORLD. cuz end portal don't spawn.
This is awesome!!!!
You can only have strongholds in Versions before the nether update
Do a nodded 100 days
Tors 200 plz!!
day 69 lol 19:47
This comment section makes me think I'm sorting by new.

Seriously "bich'

He has insane luck! Wish I had that....
It is infuriating that villages don't spawn on superflat in bedrock/PE. It's impossible for me to even attempt this without bonus chest.
Still a clown
Make the 2 hundy days plz.                                          God that was cringe.
Yay

First thing Luke does PROFITS!!!!!!!!
here before 300.000 views
this is the most cursed uncursed hardest 100 day challenge ever
Day 28, killing pu££y
I didn't think I would enjoy this, but like many others, I did. Thank You Luke for posting these videos, really helps through corona times.
‘I thought about making a piston door, but there was no way of installing one without making it loot horrible.’   *sad mumbo jumbo noises*
It’d be a draining process but instead of golems, you can smelt down the armor from the tool smith 🤷‍♂️ really would like to see 200 days
Sub ot  luke 😆
Time to comment for the YouTube Algorithmmmm You’re awesome, sir Notable 💖
13:08 Nice

Very notable

SLIMES THE FLIPPIN SLIMES NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Good job
I still don’t get why slime spawn
How can you beat the game it is impossible
U should look up how to get to the end on super flat. It has something to do with  floating islands. Also, have a notable day!
pls do 200 days
Yes I would like you too continue super flat hardcore but what happened to the two hundred days with The Tors?
I’d love to see this series continue!!!
If it’s not pronounced elytra then how is it pronounced
Luke please do more minecraft superflat! I really enjoyed this!
Do 200 days this is soo cool I can’t believe you beat the wither in super flat
3000 Days please
It’s really interesting seeing you get resources that seem impossible to get on super flat. Please continue the series
Nice
U should do a modded 100 days
HI
Cool video I commented
The Heck????
everybody: bastion remnant  ltn: *BLACKSTONE FORTRESS*
"Its so nice to hear SILENCE'"  made me laugh so hard
The repulsive snow secondly scratch because fowl mathematically paddle lest a weary bush. loose, garrulous mouse

Didn’t know I needed this. Glad I have it
Yay!

Slimes are stupid
You noob there’s no loot

hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
Luke: "If you wanna see more-" Me immediately after finishing the video: "I summon you to fulfil your oath."
“Get out of the bed Timmy or I’ll kill your parents”                                                        -LTN 2021
It's day 1 all over again (The memories)
EPIC YPOU ARE SO COOL
8:04 you see why that cats fur is white is because hes in the ultra instinct ability thats why he couldn't hit him/her
Can’t you customize your super flat in order to get the stronghold or is that only on Xbox 360 and ps3 I remember you were able to customize super flat
200 days chain below.
This can get extremely repetitive since unlike a normal Minecraft world it's all the same. And because of that, you need to rely a lot on your jokes and personality to give life to it, which you do well to some extent. Hopefully, this series doesn't drag on with future videos.
Pls do more of this
10:00 That is Netherwart, not Netherrack. XD
Tio many recent comments
This was uploaded 4 hours ago and 12 k comments and 96 k likes like 🤯

Is there a villager that sells iron?
I thought of this idea like 3 years ago lol.
Should make an iron farm. I mean you have the other essential one
2:58  Ah, he said it! He said it!
Could you please continue this because it just sends of so many nostalgic vibes
Would love to see 200 days!
Are we gonna talk about how he literally copyrighted 100 days so nobody else could also benefit from it
I have an idea what if you looked at how many likes this video got and you made that many more days
remeber when ltn was a halo youtuber :(
Plz keep this siris going plz
Epic
Ooh
To spawn strongholds in superflat worlds, you have to go into the world generation settings, and at the top where there's a bunch of weird code stuff, put strongholds next to villages in the same format at the end. Wow that was very confusing, there's a bunch of yt videos on it.  Anyway bye.

Those slimes are like the Titans from attack on titan. Brainless enemies trying to kill you and constantly running into the wall built by the people to survive.

Anyway love your channel keep up the good work!

Hey Luke, water can reach crops from 4 blocks away so you can make an 8 block gap and put two water at the sides of it.   Example: w = water f = farmland  w f f f f f f f f w w f f f f f f f f w w f f f f f f f f w w f f f f f f f f w all of it would be watered.
Make a iron farm

you should build a mob farm. since it's a superflat world it would be very efficient (the lower you build it the more mobs will spawn)
Luke: I feel like I've gotten really expirienced with minecraft Also luke when he saw netherwart: Oh cool netherack!

LOVE the 100 days😄
One day Luke will be one of the professional Minecraft survivalist and then will gain the world record of the longest surviving hardcore word retaking Ph1lza's world record of 5 years
I just call it el-i-tra because it sounds better in my opinion
What does the nether look like on super flat
Why did nobody tell me
When minecraft survival with Tors 200 days?
On day 98 what is that enchanted compass? Edit: on day 100 I saw it led to his house
Start in the nether and work up to full netherite.
Yes Luke. NETHERRAK. I am sure that IS Netherrak. 10:00

3:00  HE DID IT!  HE SAID THE THING
You finally played slime rancher noice
You are Legend
strongholds don't generate in superflat in 1.16 so if you want to find one you need to go back to 1.15
This guy is a mad man
9:23 His dad works for Minecraft? That’s cool
Its called flat
I guess he's still keeping up the emerald building theme.
go to 1000!
im pretty sure luke is just going insane because no rational human being would subject themselves to more than 5 minutes of a superflat world before getting bored and switching to creative
H
200 days
this guy is a very.........     intriguing....youtuber....
I love this I hope you continue it
5:51 "Killing b***hes on my land

This is a good potential series! Very entertaining. Mabye you can spawn in the end portal cuz you can't get it on flat worlds.
Cap capacitor
In bedrock the nether is flat
Please do it
My favorite part oh it’s so transparent
He did the impossible
E
Could you do a terraria series just whatever you want just please play it
Wait the way you pronounce elyrta is wrong?!? That’s how I say it and I never knew there was a different way
So who’s going to tell him he can turn down “Mob Sounds”
What is your problem,
I remember doing this on the 360 and Xbox One edition. I would also make my own custom maps. One of my favorites was a wasteland, have a ton of dirt layers, then glass really deep, and then a ton of space between the glass and ores such as coal, iron, diamond, etc. there were also structures on such as villages, mineshafts, dungeons and strongholds.
The flat world ;-;
Ok bet I’m jokin
Hi
Solid and steading unlike ur grandma
You could make 100 days in a certain biome, you Can configurate a world so it only generates 1 type of biome, I’ve done it and it’s really fun :D
I this morning thought ehen is there gonna be another video and here it is
Did he die on his hardcore world?
This was unexpected.
This was way more interesting because I didn’t know you could get this far

Wait... do iron golems do true damage when he got hit he almost died w full diamond
Thought it said 1000 days 😔

The nether used to also be super flat, but they removed it.
Plz can we get a sequel?
Every 8th or 16th chunk idk is a slime chunk which means that slimes are spawning in that chunk.

Thank you for not trademarking the 100 days. I'm not a small youtuber but I know a lot of small youtubers did things like this and that would essentially be stealing from small youtubers. Ya made a mistake, and you corrected it. Respect.
MORE PLEASE! It was really intriguing tbh I would like and watch 200, 300, and 1000.(if you can)
Love how he uses slime windows instead of fences or trapdoors😂
On day one of harassing Luke to make 200 days of Superflat minecraft I will pillage him with slime sound effects.

this came out of nowhere and I didnt expect it but it was epic! please make 200 days
Luke being a cowboy for 30 minutes straight:
Luke is a simp
What about 3000 days
Do people actually get pissy about how the word "Elytra" is pronounced? If the "incorrect" way sounds better than the "correct" way, then to hell with being correct. I pronounce it the same way you do, and no force on earth will make me pronounce it any other way.
why you did my grandma like that
Nice
imagine the 1000 day
200 DAYS!!
I would say 1000 days but I think that your map will just be carpet 😂😂😂
i did not expect this but im happy this happened you should continue this
I feel like I’m watching something... illegal...
When’s 3000 days Luke
Petition for a 1,000 day series
Haha
Plz do a subnautica 100 days
2000 days
Do a part 2
1000 days no balls

I thought this was one of those videos that copied LTN. Then I saw who posted the vid.
I actually really liked this concept
200 days

AHHAHAHHAA LUKE MY BOYYYYEEEYEYEYEEEEE PLEASE CONtINUE SERIES
when you said "smoter" my audio glitched and it said S M O aAAAAAA T E R
Let's go for 1000 days!!!!
I seem to pretty pretty damn early.
200 days soon
I would love to see another 200 days 300 days or 1000 days but Im curious on what your going to do after superflat. There's not much else. Not trying to be mean just want to see what you will come up with after superflat is done. Also love the way narrate things in a somewhat sadistic way. Makes me laugh
are you going to 3000 days harcore
LTN: Blackstone Fortresses Legundo: Pig dudes
100 days in *SuperFlat*  everyone: ???????
Ngl saw this coming but how do u beat dragon on super flat?
you too
so no end?
Make more!!!
I am in the arms of the notable
ihhihihihihiihhihihihihihi
Luke you don't need to kill the little slimes.  They don't hurt you if you didn't know
I remember trying this in like 1st grade but since I was 6 and afraid of survival mode I only played on it for like 30 minutes before leaving
i thought it would be boring but luke is here to make it more interesting cause of his ways... 😈😈😈
Maybe LTN died in his hardcore world so he is doing this :O
Do 200 days of this and don't abandon it like tors 200 days
S
You can buy glass from librarians
How long till 1000 days video?
1000 days pls
Yes
I wonder when “we want 200 days” people will get here
wait, it isn't pronounced "e-lye-tra"????
Balllerrr video
"There's no way to get flint in superflat" The nether: am I a joke to you?
make a 2000 days superflat it will be the best video you ever made
Why did you make a iron pickaxe? What will you mine there’s hi caves
If you want a part two, like this video Part two Superflat Club!
CONTINUE THE SERIES PLZ
I like how he called nether warts, netherrack
wha- WHAT THE FUDGE
Lol
Please continue this series
Me: mom can I have AoT? Mom: no honey we have AoT at home AoT at home: AoS
10:00 ah yes nether rack
Bonjour
I was so confused when Luke called the witches bitches because I have never heard him cuss lol
Did you die in your 2000 day hardcore world
Continue the series
"I gave them some bread and they started reproducing faster than ur mom"
i.. i .... couldn't show support :(
Another pleeeeeeaaaaaaassssseeee
Nice
The chest in this minecraft world was a paid actor 👏
You said the B word my day is complete😂✨❤️👍
I hate how people steal ur idea and give you no credit
i- HOW
It’s eleytra
I love this please make a 1,000 day on the super flat world
I think the villagers cheated in the diamonds
wow
So there not going to be 5000 days...😢😢😢
Do 3000 days
“I made a sword and a pickaxe, I think most of us would.”
I never thought this type of thing could happen, but then again this IS Luke
Today I learned that structures generate in a super flat world....
There are stronghold but the ender eyes dont work. You should try looking for a stronghold between Y/ X 1400 to 2600
Pog
go to 2000 day's like the regular series
One time i killed a wither skeleton and a zombie pigman picked up and WORE the head in hardcore so i had to fight 100 dam pigman for the head
That was awesome good job Luke
ITS FLAT!!
5:51 he said a naughty word
flat earth community copyrighted flat stuff I hope you notified them about this video
This man is a beast
*bitches* Luke: witches... I MEANT WITCHES
Everyone: I'm sad   Luke: posted  Everyone: RETURN OF THE KING
Great idea👍
He needs to make a mob farm on episode 2 (200 days)
Fun fact slimes are the only mobs to spawn with what ever light level mean they can spawn in complete day light or night time  doesn’t matter as long as it is a spawn chunk
more pls
How did I get here
F l a t
Okay, I gotta ask. When Luke TheNotable asked at 25:54 if we heard the slimes did anyone else just feel off not hearing them at all?
I loved it
Video Idea: 100 Days in the nether
THIS IS GREAT!!!!! WATCH IT
please continue this series up until 3000 days of the original, its a nice breather until the caves and cliffs update
Whoa he built wall Sina and rose walls 😄.
“Months”
Or forge labs
5:52 did u really say a bad word O. O
that moment when you realize you were laughing how bad he is at minecraft 2 yrs ago and now he's better than you
Are you going to do any more of the 2000 days in Hardcore
3000 days hard-core regular  are we gonna get it?
Flat earthers seeing this video: *I  K N E W  I T!  T H E  E A R T H*  IS  *F L A T*

For LTN: In the Nether bone blocks spawn in mass. You can easily get 8-9 stacks of bone meal in about 20 minutes.
We. need. all. the. flat. days.   Also are you still going to continue the hardcore?
Im going to try this cuz it sounds way better than I thought it was when I saw the title lol

the legacy continues
You did pronounce elytra correctly
DAY 3 TRYNA TELL LUKE TO DO 100 DAYS TERRARIA!!!
Why in de description says This video is intended for audiences 13+ years old for the following reasons Fantasy violence Violent refrences Suggestive themes Crude humor Minecraft is a E for everyone game. Also i might be wrong why did he put that in the desc.

Wait how do people say elytra? I always said elitra
*Slime Noise*
5:49  Did he just...

Hi luke
Time to play on bedrock and generate an Old style world. It’s 100% harder
200 days superflat?
I just heard notable swear
What a notable journey
donald trump in a nutshell
Back in the 360 days, I always played on superflat. On the 360 version, the nether was also flat, not sure about the next gen consoles though.
Yeah, looking forward to 200 days. Pretty awesome if you ask me.
This is dumb
Do more plz
im already subbed. keep the series going its slightly better than the 4000 day series
What if you make a grave for your horse
Day 18 or 19 he said bitches
Luke should do 100 days in a cave, I know a YouTube has already done it but it’s similar to super flat where you can’t get certain resources. It seems like a fun video tbh
I want you to do 5 real life years just like Ph1LzA did.
Please do another episode you are soo.... good at Minecraft
👁👄👁 Kinda early
Omg finally I’ve been waiting for this
Whats the seed

Petition for Luke to do a speedrun 👇
Yes
pp
I LOVE THIS SERIES LUKE THE NOTIBLE!!!
wait... I forgot this vid didn't come out a year ago
I only gave him a like and commented cause i want to him to do day 200
Me: *see the title* mmm I don't think he do too much *Luke make a farm and creates an armor* Me: How *visible confuse*
what about the other world?
you cant beat minecraft on a superflat in 1.16 you have to be on 1.15 in order for strongholds to spawn Like so luke can see
200 days trors
100 day TM
You can get water bottles and fire res from Piglin bartering.
*100 days playing in real life*
Even better.
Played 2500+ days worth of Minecraft and still manages to call Netherwart as Netherack FFS 😂 . . . . . . . . . . . . Tho we still love you Luke, keep up the content!-
I thought at first this was impossible
Saplings too close spread them out for more
I always thot that surviving in a super flat was impossible but you just proved me wrong also, I want you to continue this flay series
So while it is sad you may not be able to go to the end but if you enable strongholds then your ender eyes will most likely work.
Did he die in his other hardcore world?
Wow another series
LTN: hey hey some netherack I can use that to make potions  Me: it’s nether wart
lol this dude thinks thats tough, my 1st ever survival world was flat (accidentally ) I didnt figure out how to make an actual world until 1 YEAR later (I was about 7-8 at the time) until then all I had was DIRT and some raw meat. Managed to make a treehouse to keep myself away from the HORRIFYING mobs (I spawned in with a bonus chest) and the best thing I had was an iron sword from the blacksmith chest. Keep in mind that this was an offline version meaning no witches, wither skeles, and items like slime blocks and redstone blocks. man I did love that world tho... I remember my 1st night and all i had defense wise was a stick lmao beat the crap out of a skeleton... then got yeeted by an enderman and cried not wanting to get back on that world for like a day. (THE ENDERMAN 2 HIT ME DEALING 10 DAMAGE EACH HIT) honestly one of the best worlds I had tbh lmaooooo
Part 2 plssssss
good series, would watch more
yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye eyeyeyeyey
Please do more superflat! I loved this
Notable never fails to deliver THE NOTABLE CLAN WE MUST BUILD AN ARMY TOGETHER WE WILL RISE
We NEED 200 days superflat
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
This is a really interesting series, i never thought you could get all those items in superflat but here we have em. I wish you would continue to 200 days atleast, maybe more if you feel like it.
Let's fo for 200 days
He does better in a superflat world in 50 days  than I do normal world in 100
next series: 100 days on a skyblock world
Yess continue
Ltn, please dont be an arse if I do this too

Keep this going i love this 😀
200 days?
the similarities between PETA and Luke are very far and in between that we don’t even blink at Luke’s very obvious animal cruelty. Not trying to say it’s cool, but the humor. *THE HUMOR*
Idk why anyone would want a lava trash. U should just put garbage in some chests...maybe put chests underground? I just think it’s dumb to permanently get rid of items.
Do 200 days !
What is the mob LTN saw the most? Is it:  A. Villagers  B. Slimes  C. Creeper  D. All the Above  E. Non of the above  *put the answer in my comment’s comment section*
Do 300 days superflat
Luke u cant go to the nether because u need to ass it to the super flat world code to spawn, big rip
He can make a mob farm
Idk y but when I was 6 I would play super flat and have the levels be dirt, cobble ,iron and diamond

Thank you for making another 100 days
11:31 it IS called elytra though?

I turned Minecraft into a farming simulator, and this is what happened
Nylon plays anyone?
Luke Ross, painting his map with green.

This was EPIC Do 200 Or 1000 I Don’t care..
NO NO FLAT WORLD 5000 DAYS IN HARDCORE ANGRY EYEBROWS >>>>>:(
Mabey more days?????
Ez nice clap
Luke:Killing bitches Also Luke:I mean witches Me:Sureeee😏
he he witches :D
Hai
Epic. We need 4000 more days of this, at least
go to the nether and farm the fossils
POV u haven’t finished the vid
200 day challenge: Super beacon made from emeralds. Also if you want the End in this there is an exploit with entering a lan room (yes even on hardcore) where you can make your world creative. Maybe set up the frame of an end portal that way but fight endermen for the eyes and such? Superflat is easy to run out of things to do when compared to vanilla.  Awesome video dude. Loving this content. It was my inspiration for getting into Minecraft in the first place.
Supraflat
This was so enjoyable to watch please make 200 days!
Keep doing hardcore flat world.
0:09 unlike UR MOM
How did he get pumpkin pie?
3:09  "GET OUT OF BED TIMMY OR I'LL KILL YOUR PARENTS." relatable
uwu
Corporate needs you to find the difference between this picture netherrack) and this picture .(netherwart)                                                         Luke The Notable: they're the same picture.
Y tho?
where is 3000 days?
No, cobblestone generator until day 56?
1000 DAys
8:23 when I step on my cat's tail
Imagine trying to hog the clout of 100 days
Luke put the sheep in one block like so you only use one shear so you won't have to use 8163 so put all of them in the one surrounding
I didnt think you would actually do this when i saw it I was like this can't be real but I am glad its real please continue the series
do the day series in rl craft
Go for it... 200 days!!
Day 25: I made a sword, and a pickaxe, I think most of use probably would. Day 980: I made a sword, and a pickaxe, I think most of us probably would. Day 10 (this world): I made a sword, and a pickaxe, I think most of us probably would.
I tried surviving in a flat world one time
6:37 luke just did some mining of camera
Video idea: 100 days in the nether hard core.

Who else thinks he quit the 3000 days and is now doing superflat
5:52 my whole life has been a lie!!!!! I thought this was a friendly family channel but I’m OK with it👌🏻
5:49
Did you die in you other world? 😢
Are you working on the 3000 day Hardcore? Like your videos
You've said Bich*s
this concept is awesome please continue it and i recommend amplified mode
5:51 started off good got some arrows and killed some (DEMONITIZED)
I think you can prevent spawns by turning grass into path blocks
I like you to continue the series. It's quite interesting to see
I love this man

actually increasing the size of the fortress in the nether does nothing for spawns they only spawn on a certain amount of blocks on each road so it does nothing
Always love watching your hardcore series

New series
hi Luke! you have inspired me to start playing Minecraft WITHOUT cheats on. I would like to thank you for that ;)
Why’d he call netherwart netherack

Please continue these series
you should make a end portal if u cant find one
You should do 100 days in the nether
bruh when i was lil i played xbox 360 minecraft and always did super flat bruh memories
Am i first? No, am i last? No, am i a fan of Luke TheNotable? Yes.
This was a banger, now you need to do one with the ocean only!
Wait how did he get water?
*i honestly thought elytra was pronounced EE LIE TRAH*

This is the best thing since the OG hard core world
You should play some Fortnite save the world

;-;
its sad bc now we have to wait longer for 3000 days :(
Ok, so I played Minecraft on an Xbox360 before Christmas, and all have to say is yes, the other was flat, I hated going there
If you mine the nether gold with silk touch and smelt it you'll get ingots
@Day35...Wh-where did the horse go :(
I love how in his other hardcore world by day 100 he only had iron armour and diamond tools but by day 100 he had i freaking beacon
He does not care what will happen, he does not care what he plays. He will, for sure make it to 100 days
IT’S SO TRANSPARENT - Luke TheNotable 2021

I thought this was a very interesting take on Hardcore and I think its cool! So yeah, go to 200 days!❤
I just did this like two weeks ago and the preset I chose doesn't load the end and I didn't realize it until I already had ender eyes. I was so sad.
You inspired me so much thank you
is it just me or has Luke became mo innapropriate?
I did this idea 9 mths ago,and did indeed achieve enchanted dia armour, 4 beacons,  gold farm, every passive mob farm, mob and exp grinder,iron and villager farm, and did it in a total 100 days. But unfortunately my pc got hacked so the world was deleted, shame. The name of the world was 2d
Glad he didnt die to a baby zombie... lol
P
Nein Nein Nein, This is NOT 3000 days
I hope he realizes you can turn hostile mob noises down.
Can you do a 200 days of superflat if so when?
You should do a video about can you fistfight a minecraft skeleton

Only Luke TheNotable can do this
Don't get me wrong, I love this idea. But, WHERE THE HECK IS TORS 200!?!?!?!?
This was probally harder than fighting the ended dragon. And we all need to take a moment to be triggered that he diddn’t use his acient debree on his tools and maybe his armor.
Continue this series love all you series have watched every single one but take your time I know these videos take time and the editing to so no rush

5:50 bitches
It would be cool to see a modified super flat play through. You can get to the nether and defeat the dragon.
Actually, back in the old days the nether used to be flat in super flat worlds... it sucked!!!
Pls don’t cuss anymore on thease videos my parents wach with me and they don’t like it
instead of mining the gold in the nether and getting nuggets you can smelt one of the ores and get a gold ingot and gold+apples=golden apples
A comment
please do more of the super flat this was amazing and really enjoyable
I'm trademarking this video
You haven't done a single videos and this is so FLAT! :>
Act like he never said that word when killing a witch
When is Tors 200 days

When are you gonna do 200 days minecraft with Tors (i think thats her name)
I pronounce elytra the same way as you
Not paulgg did this first
pls do 200 days minecraft superflat
When Luke post another vid Everyone: YAYYYYYYY BOIIIIIIIIIIIII
next you should do a caves one one or a one biome one
I prefer your original playthrough. Superflat just isnt the same
to beat the game in super flat you have to be in 1.15 lol
LOVE IT
After this I don’t know if we can get him to play slime rancher 🤣
The video: Luke talking about slime  80% The other part of the video: Luke talking about something else
we all want 1000 days
Flat
This is amazing always happy to see a like the notable vid
No
He should have gotten a pet baby slime.
Is 3000 days hardcore happening
5:53 bitches
Imagine Luke playing Rust.                        Idea??
Hey if you drown the zombies you can get there armor then smelt it to get iron nuggets or gold nuggets
as soon as you do pretty much everything in the overworld and nether you should just cheat in a end portal
Alt title: Luke makes dirty jokes for 30 minutes while playing slime rancher
Do 200 days
Minecraft thievery playthrough
Best you tuber out there I love your friends can’t wait for 3000 days
I honestly really enjoyed this episode i hope you make it a series
His voice is perfect 4 narrating
dj trump would be proud of that wall. also, he replaced "netherwart" with "netherrack".
Stampy vibes anyone?
hI

The Slimepound
cool video when is 200 days with tors luke
Slime just spawn in certain chunks, so you can just look at a place you want to build and if no slime spawn there, it's safe!
BOOM
As long as there’s things to do in super flat, keep doing days man.
This was epic
me: ugh its so hard to build a slime farm flat word: 😂😂😂

Who else wants to go to “Gamer College”
Oh lord this is very bad
I enjoy this very but I still have one question      Where the tors 200 days?
wheres the 3,000 days of hardcore minecraft?
I'm just thinking how hard it would be for Ltn to put carpet every where
You do realize that if you manage to get a conduit, you can kill every slime around it automatically
Black stone fortresses are called bastions
200 days u don’t have to but like so he can see this
Watching from Guyana
The only use for a wondering trader
Hey billy, what’s your favorite 100 days episode   “I like the one where he talks about slime for a looong time!”

SMH can’t believe I’m this guy stone from Luke the notable smh
Wool industries
Ya but why tho
Noooo we need 3000 days
1 hour early
I remember when I played Minecraft Xbox One Edition when you made a nether portal on Superflat the nether would be super flat
What happened to the other world?
why did he make an iron pickaxe and not an iron axe
Finally a vid
This is a cool challenge. Imma try it
great video!
13:59 him: *breaks leaves with his axe* me: *a n g e r*
What happened to the other world
try 200 days and then if you do 1000 days so then you can fight on the end or Dragon not at the end of 1000 days
The strong hold spawns on top of the world in pieces
Sorry I can't watch you because you curse e van the h word you can't say Sorry I have to unsubscribe
gl on 3000 days btw, heehe
More hardcore in the 2000 day world
When will we see tors 200 days?
Luke the notable axes do more damage so use axes for damage to a iron axe does more damage then a diamond sword
what if u build a giant trench around your base that way the slimes would just fall in
Whole video in a nutshell: But this is super flat"
You need to manually add in end dungeons if you want to beat the game
more when?  I'm hungry for that 300 days in superflat
Lukethenotable: You can't have any slimes  Slimes: sad noises
Welp hope a comment help
Isint how you said elytra how it is supposed to be pronuonced?
Here before Luke strikes and deletes this comment
Clai your here before 1mill views
Shows how much luke has improved, from 300 days to fight the wither, to 100 days in a super flat world. Amazing
“Day 20 was a good one. I started off by getting free arrows and killing bitches on my land! I-I meant witches. Yeah, witches.”
If you place slabs on the ground all around your land, it should  also prevent the slimes from spawning in those areas
What happened to the shovel at 4:10
I was hoping next upload would be 3000 days in regular hardcore but now you've created this I just wanna see more of it, LTN never fails to impress

Hey, Luke, i'm pretty sure slimes cant swim, just build a moat around your area
I love this series don't get me wrong, but in the last couple of days his xp drops from 35 levels to exactly zero... so I wanna know if maybe you died and then just did "open to LAN" and turned on cheats so you could respawn or something. Not tryna expose you I just noticed it and It got me thinking

10:00 nether R A K
I have an idea that you could do (if you are going to do 200 days superflat). Make a fully automated weat / potato / carrot farm using villagers to harvest and plant the crops. Then you sell the crops to a farmer and you make a ton of profit. If this doesnt make any sense there are tutorials on how to do it
Do it please

Luke’s gonna go back to his main 2000days world,  find a slime chunk by accident, and cleave the earth itself to get rid of it due to pure ptsd
as each day passes, luke becomes closer to committing mass genocide on the slimes
I wanna know why your trying to make the 100 day hard-core thing your ™️ ®️ or whatever but to be honest I don't think people wanna watch ONLY you even if u could get that done😂
did yu die in yur hard core world
welp, here we go again
200 DAYS BY TOMOROW OR ELSE!!!
200 days now Edit. Oh and I have no idea can you do 100 days in the nether because it is possible to live in the nether because of the 1.16 update and I’ve tried something it is possible to start in the nether and go back to the overworld. So I think it would be fun

Burt's bees
100 Days Amplified?
noice
pretty cool. Wheres 3000 days.
Best and efficient old farm is a 9x9 with one block of water in the middle. Covers it all. There's a better one since they added bees. it's still a 9x9 but you put a beehive ontop of the water block in the middle and flowers literally surrounding your farm.  But I want you to know this information because the way you have your farms physically hurts me.
I wish I had more subs
Hello there pg 100 worlder

nether isn't flat in java? I switched back from bedrock recently (played java from like 2011-2015 but came back and got a pc a month and a half ago) the nether used to be flat in super flat worlds and it was really cool
Luke why would you do this to yourself?
Hi Luke I wanna see 200 days

5:51

He said the B word
🔥🔥🔥
Insert comment here
what about u and tors 200 days
HE IS BACK!!!!
Game theory, Luke’s dad works on Minecraft and he used his son to make the game super popular these days when it’s not in its prime
if you needed bonemeal you could try to get a composter and shove all the extra crops in it
Ah yes netherack to make potions
Who remembers when the nether WAS superflat?
IMAGINE taking down other 100 days videos cause you made it popular like you didn't start it like damn
When your make a sort of flat world you're supposed to make customize it I think
Next up Vertical Survival
Wi love your Minecraft vids
I don't think this series will see the light of day to get a 200 days
The slimepound
I want you to do 2000 for superflat and also I dare u to make a full netherite beacon in your other hardcore series
Do more days on super flat and maybe with tors if you can I love 100 days and it made me play Minecraft again you are a legend tors and Luke the notable keep on doing what your doing.
Just watching is 2000 days and then I saw it 100 days super flat

Hey there super minecraft fans
wot
what are you doing thats just wrong
I like this new idea.
are you doing 200 days with tors
How is there a raid?....
Luke the notable now, in my books, has the achievement of most aggressive minecraft door shutter, congrats
12:58 Coronavirus?? 👀
space your crops out in eight blocks because water waters the crops up to 4 blocks away
Don't you think it's about time you got a Luke the notable skin?
I love ur channel
6 diamonds in a chest?!?!
I like how Luke just descends further and further into his ruthless capitalist persona the longer he plays Minecraft.
Who else waiting for 200 days of tors

Before this, I didn’t even know you could survive on a super flat world. Great video, and I hope that there will be a 200 days in the future.
500 days
Again pls
Honestly when people make these 100 day videos I don't enjoy them as much but when this man uploads a 100 day video you know its bare fire 🔥❤️
9:20 on the xbox 360 superflat worlds had superflat nethers
you know, rather than just not letting youtubers do 100 days and risking people not liking you, a better idea would be to require them to give you a shoutout so more people would watch your content
Whoah! It’s just like irl🤣
5:51 LOL
People: WHERES 3000 DAYS ALREADY
Bruh. I have been as “elytra” my hole life.
We Want 200 Hundred days
Yup super flat flat 3 block and flat"

THANK YOU FOR CONTENT MORE PLEASE
I feel a sticky piston feeling activating...

I was a bit confused but I don't care
HE SAID NETHERACK INSTEAD OF NETHER WARTS OMMGGGGGG
Lava makes nether wary grow faster
this seems to be a great survival idea
LTN makes two towers one made of slime and the other made out of emeralds
I didn’t know super flat was possible to live like this lol
When he was in the neither, in the fortress, he saw neither wart and said neither rack.

Did you die or something in your main hardcore world?
Love the idea. Please do 200 days
200 Days Tors!
If you don’t want to kill iron golems then you can put iron armor that villagers sell into furnaces to get iron nuggets, it’s slower and expensive but it’s a way
9:58 ah yes, netherack. The best potion ingredient.

I was wondering if you would ever attempt a flat-world attempt. I'm glad to see you did!! Please, continue the series up to 1,000 days. This is really amazing that you can do it on hardmode and make it look so easy at the same time.

SUPER FLAT YAY I LOVE LUKE THE NOTABLE HES SO NOTABLE LOL
Wait i didn't knew about this lol
I love this more than the normal hard core
I keep seeing comments for seconds ago 👁👄👁
will u do 3000days
YES
Blocks of lava😂
I call the elytra the same way you do. We aren’t saying it wrong they are Luke the notable
Hi daddy Luke
notable video
he said the same-
19:48 look what day
Me: My favorite mob in minecraft is slimes Luke: *What*
5:50, Who's life is worthless now, because he rarely cusses..
hello there
I’m gonna be honest... I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS
YES  MORE GOOD
Me: hardcore is hard  LukeTheNotable: i going to do hardcore on a flat world
wonder if he ever gets bored playing minecraft so often
5:22 Yeah just like women
My only thought would be what there is left to do? Getting max beacons is nice, but repetitive, killing the Wither 24 times or whatever. If you can't get to the end, I'm not sure what else there is to do in the world. But I'm not a Minecraft expert, so there is probably something I don't know about that would keep things exciting for another 100 Days.
wen is 3000 days
How did I miss thisssss Nuuuu!!! >~<
This is a another awsome series of yours! I can't wait for next episode!
You guys are sad
3000 days
Copycats asemble.
Could you do 200 days with your wife on Minecraft
So 29,000 likes in one hour, is it safe to say 200 days very likely?
Hi

Luke does know that his world isnt superflat, Its just flat  A superflat is like flat but the difference is that you can customise the world  Luke could find a stronghold if he just enabled layers of stone and the stronghold to spawn when he was making the world

i didnt realize i was early
He copyrighted someone because it had the “100 days hardcore”
i did all of the above for 200 days

I wonder why the eyes weren’t working because I’ve seen people beat Minecraft on super flat
no table
Pog
Did luke die in the 3000 days while makeing it
10:00 do u mean nether WARTS
you can find a stronghold in superflat, but the eyes can't guide you to it but it'll be in the sky once you do find it so it should be easy to spot :)
I didnt expect the nether to not be superflat. On the xbox 360 its superflat too and the walls are out of bedrock so thats funny :)
Get somebody in creative and tell them to make the end portal but you give the eyes
200 days plz
EARLY! I guess..
Yeeeesssss

I like how in the 100 days video when he got diamonds he said “I made a sword and a pickaxe I think most of us probably would.” Then when he got his first pieces of netherite he said “I made a sword and a pickaxe I think most of us probably would.” And now in this very video when he got his first few iron ingots he said “ I made a sword and a pickaxe I think most of us probably would.” Gotta keep the tradition alive lmaoooo
This is epic
Noice
Awesome I would love if you played more
10000000000000 days with socksfor1

DO 200 DAYS PLZ PLZ PLZ
alternative title: 100 Days™ [Minecraft Superflat]
I would love you to continue this! it's such a cool series
Next is 200 day. Please
OMG
Yay new vid

Hey im early also 200 DAYS PLZZZZZZZ!!!
"its not pronounced elytra" wait wtf
Whoever dislikes this is a monster
When the ground is not flat slimes can’t spawn
Hope to see 100 fortnite drop in the coleesom
MORE
Bro I did this when I was younger
In 200 days make a great wall of slime stretching from village to village so you can bunny hop from village to village. It will require you to commit minor genocide against slimes to build but it will be worth it kinda.
The greatest flatworms series ever made change my mind.
You should try 100 days of surviving in the nether
I forgot about villages can spying on super flat now I’m going to be hard for super flat I hope you don’t consider this stealing your idea but it’s funny but I need to find a village bye
Wow I'm early. This came out of nowhere
YES!
Pls make the tors 200 days
waiting for 200 days in superflat
2000 days
Cant believe he was able to make superflat interesting
200 days pls
Yay more
I DIDNT KNOW YOU CAN SO SO MUCH IN A SUPER FLAT WORLD!!! PLEZ DO MOREEE
29:59
some of you could do more in 21 day 100 days quote luke the notable day 19 dimand boots
The whole video: *boink boink boink*
I have an idea you have unlimited source of emaralds why don't you cure villagers which sells iron stuff (I forgot their names) and then smelt them to make iron. It is more unefficient but it makes you feel better.
I’m starting to think I can see my YouTube feed with other people making the same thing, Nice video Luke :)
more please
Hope you have a extremely notable day.
WEE NEED 200 DAYS
This is cool but what about 200 days with Tors
.ندر
Cool!
“Wow, what an efficient Cobblestone generator that didn’t break immediately” Turns Lava to Obsidian.
MORE MAKE MORE
29:59
Thank u
Biteches on my land... YES! LUKE IS NOW FOR AUDULTS ONLY! SUCK ON IT KIDS!!
humm, why is there no notification, I missed it, I'm gonna bring Youtube down. Help Luke the Notable take over Youtube. It shall be call LukeTube
I bet next video is 3,000 days or 200 in flat world if I wrong dislike my comment
Can you do 200 days
Luke like soup?
you know you can customize your flat world when creating it. If you did cool if you didn’t oh well but this is cool because I’d never think of doing this and it’s very interesting.
LETS GO HES BACCKKKKK
Tip : if you use silk touch on the neather gold and smelt it you get 1 bar per 1 block.
Hope people read this and sub to me
100 days in cave mode
oooooooooh
big epic video
200 days with the tors please
You should do more different themed 100 day minecraft series. The format is really fun to watch.
👍
Other youtubers: oh yay, I can use 100 days content   Luke the notable: 5:24
5:49 oop I didn’t know he cursed LOL
Can you do 100 days of floating islands in mc
Plz do 200 days

Ez mode how to get rid of slime torturing sound Hostlie sounds make it off

Continue superflat
POG

I was trying to survive in superflat world too but I died.
Nice idea
He did the impossible

Now do it without villages spawning
Where 200 dyas with thors
When he says "Perfect", he sounds like Perfect Cell from Dragon Ball Z
This must've been really hard
Write a comment
Yay keep going
I can safely say, that I was part of the Minecraft series
I won this in 10 minutes. What? No, I didn't cheat! Yes, the world has 2 layers of wood, stone, iron, diamonds and netherite, and I built an end portal in creative, but it's still a Superflat world!
is this gonna be a new series?
Cave style next?
*finds netherwart*   HeY nEtHeRaCk! :D
Please continue I just finished the video
B
200 days
I agree
Do part two and upload it today
Please 200 to 300 to 1000 days this series is so good
This was so cool i'd love to see what you can do with another 100 days :)
wow
Good video☺
Ahhh finally, i've been waiting for this.
yes it has been posted on my birthday
Could u make a beacon with gold?
10:00 ah yes  *netherack*
I miss 100 drops
where is tors 200 days?
I never thought i would want more of any 100 blank than 3000 days, but you gotta make this a 300 day series AT LEAST. You know, since there isnt a whole lot of stuff to do in a superflat there really isnt much point to make it to 1000
I must of been hard
*Writes Comment Per request*
petition for 200 days?
May you do a "Surviving 100 Days In Real Life" video?
LTN - On the first day I built a Sword and a Pickax I think most of us probably would.
what happened to the 3000 days :(
I like the flat world series can you do more
5:51 WHAT DID U SAY
Me who has played minecraft for years:this is cool   Lukethenotable:I found some netherack *starts getting nether wart*   Me:*rage intensifies*
47 minutes ago 🥰🥰🥰
Why you could not fight the ender dragon is bcuz you have not enabeled the thing called strong hold

M a k e m o r e
Dude I used to watch u a lot during the lockdown and hearing ur voice after such a damn long time brings back a lot of memories.. Love ur vids keep up the gud work
I'm surprised that the nether is not super Flat. OG Xbox 360 super flat nether was. I wonder why they changed it
DO IT ON DESERT
Yes ltn upload!
Pls make this a long series
Maybe Luke could try other world types, like an ocean world, cave world, or floating island world.
At the end when he said "stay-" and the video ended before he said "notable" makes me feel very disturbed
What an interesting idea!
11:33 "I know it isnt pronounced Elytra (E-lie-tr-uh)" Wait, that's not how it's pronounced?
This reminds me of stamps super fast challenge
Hmmm, he couldn’t make a emerald beacon....  Noted
Please do 100 days in the nether
Wow
Have a flat day
when 200 days loke and tors minecraft does it come or ?????
Hiii
I expected this video to be really bad but... consider my expectations subverted

Superflat Hardcore.
Superflat Hardcore.

I want more super flat!
I like
Luke: Imma killing bitc- I MEANT WITCHES!
I used to only play flat survival when I first played minecraft, I just liked it for some odd reason
200 200 200
POG
What why and how
do more
Question science still haven't answered: Is alex flat?
Minecraft is generated in chunks, with some chunks being identified as "slime chunks". These chunks have no visible difference other than between y=40 and y=3 slimes will spawn no matter the light level. This is the reason that slimes spawn everywhere. You must've built your compound on a non slime chunk, which is why none spawn there.
even better than the original serie :D
I like watching luke suffer pls make this a series
Plzzzz continue this series if anyone agrees heart this comment
Is there gonna be a 200days in superflat hardcore?
please do 100 days!!!
The regular house is tall, so make this one wide

Please make more survival of this flat World, because you’re teaching me so much What to Do on this World! 😇
i did a challenge like this however it was only a single layer of leaves so it was like a budget skyblock lol.  I suggest you make a mob farm, you got bones and bone blocks, suger, redstone, and xp.  Love your videos and keep up the notable work!!!!!!! <3
luke you are so cool can i play with you
I wish People would sub to me
I'm hoping by 1000 days he has made an insanely large sheep farm, and uses carpet across the world to eliminate the slime population for hundreds of blocks in any direction.
Yes plz make series of super flat

THE RETURN OF THE KING
This challenge is the incarnation of pain condensed into a youtube
I'm still waiting for tores (idk how its spelt) 200 days. Just saying we were told it was coming!
I haven’t watched the whole video yet, but if you haven’t build an iron farm
do more
Second best Minecraft series
Yooooooooooo whats up
I’ve thought about playing survival on a super flat world before, i’m really happy Luke made this video!
Go to 300 day so you can make more builds and get more beacons. The reason I say 300 days is because I don't want it to be too long and take over your main world.
13:48  “You weren’t supposed to say that”
E
I'd love to see 200 days
This is my idea but 100 days on a old world the old world generation might just be in bedrock but it would be cool
Luke: sets FOV to 69 Me: Ah I see, a man of the culture
1000 days would be interesting
Early
lmao:5:50 ima die
Can you do 200 days with toris
Can we get a tour?
Fuper schlat
when are u gonna do 200 with le toris
It was cool having a 100 days flat world, but tbh its gonna get a bit boring how limited you are. but I don't mind seeing 100 days modded series like other channels or even like a 100 days island series or many more. Thats the best part of minecraft no limits
LUKKKKEEEEEEE VIIIIDDDDD
YES.
The wait to record 3000 days until the next update must be killing him. But I can tell this is an idea he had during 2000 days and wanted to wait until he finished
When I first saw the title I thought it would be boring but of course it’s a ltn video so of course it was entertaining. You should defiantly continue this series
Killing bi**** I mean witches
Cant wait for 2000 days
wait this means he died or has done 3000 days but its been to quick
200 days would be funny
Pogchamp

Lukethenotable. If you continue this series make a mob farm. It'll give you more drops and since witches spawn everywhere in superflat you can get glass bottles from it
This was awesome! Here’s to 200 days!
GET A JEB_!!!!!!

Ah yes, netherrack for potions.
Luke is the only person to make a flat minecraft game entertaining.
"And I killed lots of b*tches, I mean witches.."

Why does he call bastions black stone fortresses?

It would really be fun to watch 200 or even 1000 days of this world.   Hope he doesn't die😅😅😅
This was a surprisingly different vibe  than normal 100 days, It feels kinda similar to skyblock in the sense that you have to grind for everything you get. Very enjoyable, would love to see more

Luke the notable is no longer family-friendly
I say elytra the same way
slimes can only spawn in slime chunks under y=40 and swamps. Your base is in a plains biome, and not in a slime chunk, so your base is safe from any slimes spawning
slimes go BRRRRRR
Definitely do 200 days 🙂
Just got back from a skye's vid lol
Today i was fr thinking about 3000 days and this came out God bless you LTN almighty
what a surprise!
There is a way to stop the slimes: If you trap a bunch of slimes underground and name them,  they will take up the mob cap and make them unable to spawn. The only problem is that you need name tags and if you leave the loaded chunks then it will stop working and slimes will spawn again.
Super Flat: wait thats impossible..
You should build mountains and make it a normal world
wait, you're telling me people say eleetra?
I TRIED THIS ONE TIME WHEN I WAS LIKE 10
Hi luke
Have been thinking about it for a while and can’t figure out how he got water. Any ideas anyone?

WOO!
For the end you have to enable the Dungeon to spawn before starting the world
Bro, you should do Amplified. Rarely any Minecraft players play on Amplified worlds. It's a shame.
On the xbox 360 the nether would be flat fun fact
OMG LUKE U R SO COOL I LOVE YOUR VIDS I BET THIS IS GOING TO BE SO AMAZING YOU ARE SO COOL I LOVE MINECRAFT :)

On day 40 he said it’s not pronounced el-igh-tra. That’s how I’ve always pronounced it. How the hell is it pronounced?
How did he get a tree saplings in superflat.
Luke tried to go to end in superflat in 1.16 and in 1.16 there is no stronghold but there is a stronghold in 1.15
the decription says for 13+ yr old but im 10 and think that this is one of the most amusing and halarious and best well made series keep it up luke ur making our days better with your content 😃
YES!
Hi
You just made my day! So excited
Funnily enough in old Xbox 360 the Nether was flat like the rest of the world
"This video is intended for audiences 13+ years old for the following reasons Fantasy Violence Violent References Suggestive Themes Crude Humor" Homie Minecraft is a game meant for 6 year olds LOL
Cool
Awesome
I thought this was impossible to do a super flat world and survive until I saw this.
9:59 ah yes the legendary Netherrack needed for making potion. Very lucky man
pog

Nice my boy luke 💕
Could you do 1 block mincraft
Day 1000 of superflat massive village
And you are a god now Edit: seriously did you seriously just think that the end can be in a super flat? I mean you can probably make one if you're in creative but still seriously?
Strongholds don’t spawn on super flat 1.16 but they do spawn in 1.15 have a notable day
well I say it liek you say it and I think u do pronounce it liek that (like*)
Thought it was impossible!
Luke to find the end you should have made this 100days in 1.15 because the end portal spawn in 1.15 superflats not 1.16
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
:o
Who else saw not Paul GG do this first 😳
needed this finally :)
Lol "I know it's not pronounced E-lie-tra" even though the majority of players say it that way
He says it not about vanity but HE HAS AN EMERALD TOWER
make a coblestone generator
Not to call this out or anything but anyone else notice how there were way too many diamonds in the blacksmith chest at 8:22 because I looked it up and the maximum amount that can spawn is 3 while Luke finds 6. Bit sus ngl
“Get out of the bed Timmy or I’ll kill ur parents”       Timmy: O_o
When is 3000 coming out

People who credit you and you take down thier videos. Your selfish, if you stop "claiming" 100 days or just 100 what ever then things might be different.
Not what I expected to watch today, but now i have to watch it on repeat for 4 hours
If you need rails search on youtube infinity rail farm wicth i very cheap. I know that it will work ( i have one on my own world )
Will you do 3000 days
Never thought I would have heard Luke say yay gravel
Didn't expect this but enjoyed it

Hey you could actually go to the nether with the lava from the blacksmiths
Yayyy new vid
i am not 13
5:49 LOL 😆😂🤣😅😄
I remember when the nether used to be super flat
Luke, I think everyone is OK with it if you just take 12 end portal frame and build a portal manually.
You can buy glass from maxed out librarians
Could this be a new series
Believe you need to manually allow strongholds to spawn on superflat to find the end
love ur vids
I know why it takes so long for him to upload
Hi
You should do a gameplay on American Truck simulator there is tons of mods that are awesome and it’s really fun especially when you break the game by using retarded mods

This was not what I was expecting today
You can’t lie, you have not watched all of the video yet.

I already see it, he will be making so much profit :DD
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Me: plays only on mcpe and is confused how you survive  Also me: oh Java has VILLAGES?
Luke: Finds netherwart  Also Luke: Oh look some netherrack
Wait if it’s not pronounced elytra than how is it
LTN: finds fortress in 35 days  Me: played minecraft for 5 years but has literally NEVER and I mean NEVER seen one even in creative
Theres an superflat nether in bedrock edition i think
Here before this hits trending 👇
Noo Luke.. don't change.. your commentary is getting too over the top.. You were perfect the way you were!!
What a champ
It is pronounced elytra
Interesting
hi
Lava from village + obsidian from chests at village = nether portal
is ok luke  i say elYtra
Man didn’t expect that...
Luke is The *Notable*  Please more SuperFlat
W- wait then how do you say elytra?😰
Mr.Notable can u make 3000 days in hardcore
Ok
cool
Hey Luke you should do 100 days of pixelmon
I play pc so that can't happen (village spawn in flat)
The merch is so cursed
"Hey hey some netherack , this will be great to make potions if I get glass bottles"   Me : ...what?
I've done this like 50 times when i was younger, then I got gud.
I got the notafication for while playing my super flat... and the nether is flat
I go to play minecraft  1000
I call it ely-tra .,. That’s how most people say it just like how u said it at 11:31
Ayy ltn on a Saturday
Netherrack is ESSENTIAL to potion making of course.
I didn't knew you could survive
200 days with tors
9:47
HYPE
i once played a superflat world on ps3 and i found an end portal
Bruh
I usually play on public servers like hypixel because vanilla singleplayer is boring, but watching your videos I can remember the pure excitement I first had about minecraft all that time ago.
Luke , you should try 100 days on hypixel skyblock
What about playing 100 game of minecraft skywars 🤷🏻‍♂️
9:59 "Hey Some Netherack Those Can Be Used For Potions"    Did You Mean Netherwart?      Please Do 200 Days
I thought it was impossible... It would take a madman to survive
Claim your here before 1mill view tickets!
This morning I was REWATCHING 2000 days because I was bored of no 3000 and then I saw this
mad it
Suggestion: 100 days in hypixel skyblock
When do we get 3000 days
Hi

But just play with tors
Yay. Plz do 3000 days...
Ltn relly did not hold back on this language this episode and I loved it

P o g
OMG I LOVE IT
There actually was a superflat nether in minecraft ps4 edition I remember it lol
Fun fact: In the older versions of Minecraft the Nether was flat in superflat, I don’t know if this applies to Java Edition, but I know it applies to console.
hi im early!
11:33 it’s not pronounced like that!?!?!?
stop looking at comments and watch the video
Wow I'm early BTW when 3000 days hardcore? Did you die?
How else do people say Elytra then??
I finally made it to a ltn video early
They protested my Wall, so I killed them.
So, who else knows about the dick move Luke pulled when he trademarked 100 days? Only reason I'm even watching is to see if he mentions it.
Um this came out of nowhere
Yes
Hey luke, if ya really need, when ur iron is about to break, smelt it into nuggets, and make it into bars
wait a second ur dad works for mojang?
I wonder if Luke turned on newest comments so that they can drown out any hate from people talking about the whole 100 days thing
?
Everyone who reads this have a great day! : )   Read more
Oh nice
This is basically just farming simulator meets slime rancher
He should eventually do 2000 days in this
YES A NEW UPLOAD!  (Luv your channel btw's)
Luke: Has survived over 2000 days of hardcore minecraft and is amazing at minecraft due to his skills growing over the last year Also luke when he finds nether wart: Oh hey netherrack!
Stop deleting comments :(
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE FINNALY NEW VID
hey i wasnt first yay
Yesss he’s back
10:00 nether wart not netherack

When is 200 days with Tors? Also before world gen you can choose how many layers a super-flat world will have as well as what the layers are by the way you need enough layers to generate the stronghold as well if you want to go to the end
Wait, did he just call netherwart netherrack? What a dumdum
me watching: dude..... why
*As a wise man once said :*  _"Only when a mosquito lands on your testicles will you realize violence isn't always the answer"._

Lol Luke the notable is da best subbed since season 1 of fortnite ah the days lel (edit this reminds me of the 100 drops in the ocean in season seven I don’t know why I think this concept of 100 days in super flat is pretty stupid like the 100 drops in ocean for the people that are not og 100 drops in the ocean was in season 7 of fortnite and when you went in the ocean you die Luke you should do that now since you don’t die do whatever should do this in other thing there is super flat only caves only islands and stuff keep on doing 100 days I would like to see 3000 days on ur normal hardcore have fun and keep up the amazing uploads (: )
