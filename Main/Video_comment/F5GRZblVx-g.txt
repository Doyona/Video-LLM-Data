"There's probably six or seven of them" me: SIX SEVEEEN
I love your videos so much
She said 6 7 hahahah
i love you videos i've whatch all of them
ts12 it means taylor swift 12 but it should be ts13 taylor swift 13
Ryan candy definitely doesn't cause any of that and that's coming from someone eats his candy all the time
This deserves all the love in the comments.
It’s red because blue is unnatural food coloring
6-7
She said 67
Gluten free stuff isn't all bad, you just gotta find the right stuff, we're gluten intolerant and it took us a while to find stuff that actually tastes good, although we usually just cook our own stuff💀
I didnt know I needed this until now ??
I feel bad for Ryan, he’s one of my favorites❤️😢❤️
I have issues with Top o' the Mornin' Coffee. It's great... for one cup. Something about the packaging makes it go weird and ashy, the next day. Some products take a while to be gross, is all I'm saying.
16:24 the way I flinched like an abused child-
Six seven
Im late but please dont support james charles. Hes a predator, also the stomach issues are probably due to artificial sweeteners, some people are very sensitive to them and some people arent. Like me artificial sweeteners are fine. I also dont taste the chemical taste people can unless theres ALOT in something..
16:25 SIX SEVEEEEN😂😂😂
67
JOYRIDE SHAL NOT BE HATED!
Hey my name is also hope just wanted to say that because I think that is really cool ❤
16:24 kids in 2025 screaming 67
I think so, Chamberlein Coffee; you should add milk to hot chocolate. It will taste better than water in it!
Thank you for posting. I know it takes a long time to edit and stuff and thank you to the Krewe.
Hopscop saying 6-7 not thinking it’ll be a meme in the future 😂❤
16:24
67
But joy ride isn’t 1 stars……. ( there was joy ride on the front)
16:25 what number
1 year after
Thanks!
You look exactly like Megan traitor
Did she predict the future? 12:24
Sorry what did you say? 16:24
Hey I was wondering if you could do a video where you go to five Below and you get every thing in the skincare section and you test them all out 😊please I have Been subscribed to you for 5 years now and I love your videos so much you are my favorite YouTuber and I whould really appreciate it if you could shout me out and can you please shout out whoever’s name  that starts with the letter s sorry that this comment is so long I am just so excited that I can finally comment on your video ❤❤❤❤❤
11:39 why would she use water with hot chocolate 😖
Poor Ryan😂😢
my wife is more sour
You need to put milk in hot chocolate not water 😅
The eyeshadow palette dun dun duuuun 4:47
Joyride is so good!
Really really late to the game, but, if no one has told you by now:  To get that high gloss shine seen on commercials, all you need to do is a clear coat or essentially a clear hair dye. This will fill in breakage and helps with long hair longevity.   When I used to bleach my hair, this is what my Paul Mitchell hair stylist did to keep it super shiny and smooth.
At least joyride won't kill you. I hate the pink lemonade it's disgusting
16:25  😂 67 lol
People were for sure trolling for feastables I like the p but butter one most
i didn't even know she is a painter
Six sevennnnnn 16:24
9:30 but ehat if ur hair is greasy before u cant shower that doesbt have any logic
7:42 hahahahahahahawhat baby
Did you just say 67😂
People in 2025 hereing 67😩
I think the thing is w feastables is that it's quite expensive for the little amount you get BC you can get more chocolate for less with other brands
She said 67
Yes
Hope put milk in your hot chocolate it makes it tastes better and not like dirty I love your vids
no at 16:36
did anyone notice that she said 67 at 16:46
Why don’t you have your own game show?
16:25 67
16:24
OKAY SO WHY ARE  THEY PUTTING JOYRIDE ON???? THATS CRAY CRAY (ty for saying they’re good tho)
12:46 My name is Trisha 😅😅😅😂😂😂
Why is she giving Chappell Roan with the makeup on
6 7
14:29 that actually looks sooooooo goood
It’s weird seeing you without pink hair 😊
Her hair is goals
Mr. Beast chocolate is the best 😋
6 or 7
Hi who’s here in 2025 I am👇👇👇👇
I do not think it’s Ryan Trahan’s fault of the stomach issues of some peoples stomachs doesn’t like it and some people does. It depends on your stomach. When Ryan Trahan tested these, I think his stomach didn’t care so he didn’t know.
Someone from the futre will say 67 is a meme thats only growing
67
67
I think their saying it’s not different to any others I bought or smth 4:17
16:27 6-7 mention???
love this
3:00 Gr what’s that pic😂
Is it just me or does Hopes hair kind of look like Faye Knightlys hair in this vid
You don’t put water with hot water hot chocolate 😢 you put milk!
17:19 I have a REALLY sensitive stomach! So I don’t think I will be purchasing any time soon!
It looks like a heart 5:51
For healthy oreo alternitive, glutino''s are overall the best in my opinion. I prefer them over oreos, you get double the sutffing and the cookie part actually tastes good
4:53 have anyone seen Leo's haircut
3:43 come onn lets be honest we all pull up our leggings after every session or sets
I like your straight hair😊
16:24 … SIX SEVEN! 😝 (sorry I had to)
Jesus is coming back. I don't know when, but He IS coming back. No I'm not forcing christianity on you guys, but I'm spreading the good news. Jesus went through the worst things, He paid THE ultimate price for you and me. when you sin, youre not condamned. God forgives you immediatly. HE loves YOU! so much, He sent His ONLY SON, who died on The cross and rose 3 days later. HE DEFEATED death. and Satan. to follow Jesus, or to be an actual christian, it is to read your Bible at least 3 times a week, pray twice a day, talk to God (hes literally your Heavenly Father), deny your flesh, Satan, and your wordly desires (sins). Jesus is THE ONLY ONE who can give you PEACE. and with Him, you WILL be happy. of course you'll go through soulfoul wars, but if you have faith and put your trust in God, you will defeat them all. God does tell you to hide underneath His feathers❤️
So regarding the first product you tried (the candy) the reactions people were having may have been caused by the alternative sweetener (not sugar). For health reasons my mom and I are doing no sugar and sugar substitutes as much as possible, and I will say after several days of not eating sugar or the substitutes, I threw up when I had something with the sugar substitute (sugar alcohols, in this case) two days in a row. I definitely think that whether or not your body is adjusted to it is important, but not always key in whether or not you get sick.
Lots of Mr beast products have lead in them.
The reason why pokimanes Cookies were so dry is she made them gluten free. Gluten is a combining agent and it sticks food together and makes cookies especially softer and more easier to bite. Gluten free flour dosent have that gluey agent so GF food is more likely to crumble and be dry :) here is the timestamp where is shows the packaging: 7:08
HOPE U SHOULD TRY [ SPACE CAMP]_[LETS TRIP]_[ FRESH LOVE] aka the sturniolo triplets bands plsssss try them🤍🙏🏻
5:08 Good idea Hope
I’ve been here since the legging closet
Cute nails❤ I love the green and Brown 😊
Very entertaining, thanks for the laughs!
13:00 LOVED IT.❤
Hi
God is so loving and Jesus is coming back so soon, In Jesus Name, Amen!❤
FaZe Rug is the scammy kid from Hannah Montana which always makes that more funny to me
Ryan made this candy,  it got a few 1 star ratings, but he made it better! He constantly improving it. Honestly, I think she should redo this video, because ryan didnt deserve that much criticism..just saying
The joyride not do to You diarrea i provet and the medic recomended 4 for day
15:00
I just really dont like the feastables at all cause they dont taste like chocolate, they crumble so bad. I didnt even think I was eating a chocolate bar and thought I had a wafer
If you add lemon to the blue matcha it turns purple
YOUR EYESHADOW LOOKS GOOD ❤
Yok can try rhode
17:41.  Your hair is shinyyy
Hope should review haley Phams new book Just friends! I think it’s on pre orders? (Sorry if I completely butchered her last name😅)
Hay can you test one star hotels please I really would love it
I have only tried the joyride sour strips but I don’t know if it is just me but I hated the flavours
Should have use a liquid white eyeliner
so when i first started tryna do glam makeup i had an urban decay palette that came with three color sets and three cards to teach you how to make a smokey eye with each color set and for me that was hella helpful regardless of my eye shape bc i got the general idea i LOVE that nikki did something like that bc its super helpful for beginners like i was back then
PSA about sugarfree candy: Most sweeteners WILL give you diarrhoea, if you eat great amounts of it. Don't eat large amounts of candy with artificial sweeteners in them if you  don't want diarrhoea! :D
We. Need hope hair dye 😂
I feel like so many of the products were good.i love how you don't spread hate.
Hi hope  I think you should go through some fast food drive through and get the best thing that have and I'm shara I'm a big fan I hope I will get to meet you one day  love you hope❤
I believe i got pokimanes cookies in a food donation, weirdly enough . It stayed in my locker for months because i hated it and i didn't want to finish it  Personally, they tasted like rocks   Its nice to see someone with the opposite opinion because i felt wrong hating it😭
I love joyride and I'm subscribed to Ryan trahan
GO JOYRIDE joyride is greta btw I tried them especially the watermelon ones
I can have shiny hair if I don't wash for a couple days 😂 Forget that product. I hate when my hair is shiny. Also, why'd you blowdry your hair without the heat protection!?
You should rate books
11:46 "5/5" proceeds putting on 4 stars
RYAN AND BRAD FOREVER!!!!!!   1. ryans is real so it wont be as sweet or strong as leading brands which is the point   2 brads is a treatment. for atualy struggling hair and hope your hair is always glowing
What do 100 push-ups for every like this gets?
?????
Lol when I eat joyride I feel fine
I love how leo’s curious every product you tried, I think he wants to test it
😢?
i eat ryan’s candy all the time and never had a stomach issue from it that’s so weird 😭
I love how Leo(the cute puppy dog) just wants to be involved no matter what 😍
Amanda
Honestly I think some of those bad reviews are just from people who hate the people who came out with them. It has nothing to do with the actual product I feel like
My stomach was grumbling when you were testing joyride…
Loved the brown hair on you!!!! 😮🤯
Pokimane stole the idea from a cookie brand from Costco but added 1 thing and subtracted 1 in the ingredients. She then proceeded fo go live and say "If youre broke just say it, its not my fault you cant afford my cookies".
Maybe YouTuber products aren’t the best but can we pls stop giving them hate
Xmondo heur gloss is Good! You see the differents hope
If you add lemon to the blue tea it might turn purple
AMERICANS gluten is neutral to your body. You can eat gluten and it won't make you gain weight or whatever you think
I mean you can buy reviews so I never go by them.
I have celiac which means I can not have gluten so if you think that it tastes good then I hope I can try it!😊
Video ideas❤️  -opening Sonny Angels- -Opening labubus- I know its not youre type of videos  But it would be fun to see❤❤
How do you know what cleaner tastes like?🤨🤨🤨🤨 1:52
Before watching the Pokimane section: these people have obviously never paid for gluten free anything if 28 for a 4 pack is expensive.  After watching: immediately notices the GF package marking 🤣🤣
Is that candy sugar free? Because yeah, sugar free candy will cause horrible gas etc. For a while I used to eat sugar free candy now and then while I was doing an ultra low carb diet.
Why did she call them leggins it’s leggings
Hope buy expensive and cheap things and see wich is best
I love joyride but the thing is if you eat more than 5 you will have explosive diarrhea. THERE IS TOO MUCH FIBER
Hi Hope you’re my favorite YouTuber you make my day❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
U look like megon tranor from better when I'm danceing
I loved your make up
Just have to be careful with sugar replacements. A lot of them are natural laxatives so depending on how your tolerance levels they’ll have that effect.
Это красивый цвет волос
For the joyride candy they are lying cause you bought it off of Amazon. They put poison in it to make that happen
Candy slime
I still want those Timberland's on your shelf! ❤️
1:51 how do u know what cleaner tastes like
0:42  pause at this time and read the full review !
The booklet brought it back to the 90s and early 2000s ❤

14:54 Leo in the back 😂❤
Umm joyride doesn’t give it
I LOVE YOU HOPE you are great and your vids are AMAZING AND FUN and leo is so cute and hope you have a great year!!! of 2025!!!
From the sounds on the reviews of the Joyride, it's just higher in fiber than they were expecting. If you eat something high in fiber and you aren't used to, yes, it's going to make you fart and poop 😂😂 learned this the hard way when I was like 14 when I ate to many fiber one bars 😂😂
can u pls try duch food
I agree sometimes there’s mold in it too 15:00
Can't trust the reviews. Or the bad ones anyways. Because creators get alot of haters and you don't even have to prove you bought it to leave one. So. That sucks.
I don't think tea in coffee flavors with added milk is something most tea drinkers would want anywhere near them to begin with, so idk what anyone was thinking they'd taste like when buying them. Feels like setting yourself up for suffering. 😅🤣
Why was your hair a little bit blonde and then it turned like a orangish red
Lost me when you pulled out the James Charles pallet..ew
I LOVE RAYAN TREHAAAN!!!
3:54 NOT THE UNDERWEAR
What is your country's name?
Well, if you have thin hair, yes it’s going to weigh your hair down. It’s going to make it really late cause it’s a really good product and you have thin hair.
Whoever said who’s in 2025 why
She’s literally using Lazyes outro sound 😣
Anyone in 1967
In my opinion tea in tea bags is not tea. It’s tea dust. I only drink tea if it’s brewed with tea leaves. And add nothing to my tea no sugar no milk etc.
sometime I went to target and I saw they had the first ever purple and green festival bar and guess what is expired for like two or like one whole year and like two months and it was so weird. I was like I didn’t even have like I didn’t I didn’t look at the days I got expired, but it was so hard that I was broke a tooth andI had a wiggly tooth and it didn’t really even do anything so but still it was so bad.
3:00 DANMM!
MEEeeEEeeEeEEEEEEEEEEE
0:09 2025 anyone ❤❤❤❤
Hope scope I wish I could see u but I don't live in America 😢😢
Good luck hope 5:32

Noooooooo joyride!
Joyride is sooooo good
For the joyride candy I hope you know they said it a good for you and dating burns calories so it it good
Stuff
Cool
RYAN TRAHAN SHOULD NOT BE 1 STAR!! HIS CANDY IS THE BEST..
About the stomach pains, its because of the fake sugars. Those tend to make people sick, like I know I can't have artificial sugar or I feel sooooo sick. About the toilet issues, that happens to anyone who has too much artificial sugar. Like the whole thing about those trending sugar free gummy bears a while back that would make people shite themselves XD
What happened to her pink hair
For the brad mondo one, your hair looked better before
Pokimane's Cookies Look Like They When Through The Pompeii Eruption 💀
If Joyride candy makes people go to the toilet, I want 12 packages.
Watching  in 2025
Itried feastables/mr beasst chocolateand it wasso bad😭😭
Meeeee❤
Its the less sugar replacement that is the issue. I bought some berry strips from a different brand that had the same sweetener. NOT GOOD for people sensitive to this sweetener.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR

I love joy ride i got some and it was so delicioso . I tried it and nothing happened I personally like strawberry lemonade .
17:14  Is this a funny line😂
The reviews on Joyride candy were from before Ryan Trahan bought the company. He bought the company and changed everything
Joyride are not 1 star
Maybe for the hot chocolate put milk instead of water it might make it taste better
I think some of these get so much hate because the people are not that popular right now. If there's a lot of hate for Mr beast his candy is good. So are those gummies.
I LOVE RYAN TRAHANNNNN (I LOVE U HOPE SCOPEEEE)
I’m watching in 2025
Do a.  Video   That. Trying.   Food.  Of.  All. The.  World
"My wife is more sour" is CRAZY 💀
The Mr beast chocolate must be inconsistent then because I was excited to try it and when I did it was the worst chocolate I've ever tasted in my life.
At 1:26 I was eating a sour strip irl😂
I watch your videos I subscribe to you guys and you guys I wish I could go somewhere that I can see you guys but I'm only here in Texas it's almost my birthday I have to be skinny for 2 weeks because like I want to eat eggs for a whole day can eggs make you skinny because my sister Desiree she eats eggs the whole day and she makes her skinny or she was doing workouts cuz I want to go to the gym I'm going to turn 15 in March the 21st actually my real birthday is in the 23rd I have two birthdays you know that yeah I love you guys

Did you hear the Good News? Jesus, the Son of God, loves us so much that He died for our sins. He was crucified, then resurrected. Jesus conquered death and has overcome the world! With His sacrifice, we can live forever in Heaven with Him in eternal happiness! Follow Jesus, repent, and live forever!   - If you want to learn more about the Good News, check out the Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John of the New Testament of the Holy Bible.
Yeah
If you want shiny and soft hair I love the gisou hair oil it makes my hair SO SO shiny and soft I love it ❤❤

Hope can you plzzzzzzz make a more Pinterest vs real
I LOVE BLOGILATESS
Bro Ryan food is not one star it is 4.5
Do more nail videos
I am  celiac disease
I'm soooo glad that my daughter (who has Celiac disease and gluten literally burns her intestines) wasn't watching this with me, as usual. You're grossed out by gluten free?! Give me a break.... they've got tons of delicious gluten free options now and I'm sorry, but if my daughter had been watching this, I would've felt horrible for her. What's that telling her?!?! She's only eight years old and very impressionable. Please, please....think before you speak. I get it because I used to be like that too, but we can all grow and learn how to be a little more kind. ❤️
Every time you blinked it looked like you had fake eyes painted on your eyelids 😂 and it was sending meeee
the pink lemonade sour joyride strips are SO gross, it tastes like licking a sugar coted dirty tire
YOU DO NOT DISS MY RYAN TRAHAM
So, an update on the oat milk. No shop is allowed to charge you more anymore. It was ruled to violate the Americans with Disabilities Act because lactose intolerance is classified as a disability.
I got that friend of hair dye from my mom ❤️❤️❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ this.
3:02 my bday is when she posted it😊
1:50 how do you know what cleaner tastes like
Disappointed to see you platform anything from a self confirmed predator. I did not think you were like that
6:07 Is that hyperpigmentation?
Under hour gang
The feastables ki ll ed a kid
Hii hope I think Nikki’s line in her makeup that white line it was prob a a eye liner
I ❤ James Charles he's so talented
3:02 what is that😂😂😂
JOYRIDE DAMN.. ITS NOT 1 STARRR
9:45 her hair looked rough tbh...😅😅
I know that it's been 10 months since you posted this video, but you really should put some lemon in the butterfly pea flower one because it'll be really interesting what happens just saying...
With the Mondo hair it works best if its used over hair that has been dyed by his hair dye. His hair dye is really nice, very conditioning and lasts a while if you do proper maintenance. They (and you, sorry) use too much of the Mondo Shine and they absolutely leave it in too long because I am very particular on my hair products but would recommend his. His stuff also smells AMAZING!
Please do more of these videos
hey mam is there a reason for this other thing that we have to know.
4:15 say WHAT
Shiney
14:24 what about 2025 😂
4:01 I have that palette

14:42 here James Charles haters don’t go back
I dont vanna see youre viedios agan youre but is so big
Your makeup looks really good. Five stars.
The feastables tastes like normal chocolate and it’s way too sweet. I suppose that’s why people are saying that it’s gross it’s probably because it’s too sweet s
you're cool
Hello I am James Charles cousin. Why did you give him that rat? You should’ve gave him 100 out of 5?
This is Nikki’s cousin and why did you give her makeup palette that you should give it a 100 out of 10? I’m.
This is Nikki’s cousin and why did you give her makeup palette that you should give it a 100 out of 10?
13:48 I think she used a white mascara
Yiu didn't rate james charles paints
Im watching in 2025
Where are the Arabs now?
Hmm, hope scope I have a late video idea try out the worst rated sour candy ever! ❤

Mia Maples just launched her custom sweat pant sets! Sold out in 12 minutes 🙌 I hope you were able to snag some to make another "YouTuber brands" review video 😄

Your video is the best
Why is kassies product 1 star ?

I love you!! I am your biggest fan ♡o ♡
I heard pokimame stole the cookies from costco
Yall need to taste Norwegian chocolate. That’s the best chocolate. I tried mr beasts bars and they were AWFUL. Tasted like cardboard
NO NOT RYAN TRAHAN😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG
This is no hate to Hope scope it’s to James Charles James Charles has posted something really really rude like I hate him for this because he did this make up thing and he was only like talking to his girl. The other girl got left out and he said that she was like in a movieor something and she got bullied and then he said he doesn’t even care and then he literally said to her you’ll never win so shame on James Charles but you don’t deserve any good reviews
9:29 Don’t brush your hair when it’s wet! Bad idea.
I tried Joy ride candy and nothing happened
I love your hair😍😍😍 9:50
You can do a video about Japanese popular candy and dessert
Her hair was so shiny ❤ 10:29
see, I hate that the James Charles reviews were so biased. The products were great quality and super unique with the packaging. I loved the idea and even the marketing. But people didn't give it a fair chance.
I love Ryan trahan
Did you ever go BOOM 💥!!!!
I would like you to do Lin.The short to put on stitch stuff, go to chin.And get some clothes there from sheen

Omg Nikkie is Nederlands net als ik ik heb je pas een paar dagen indekt en ik kijk je filmpjes de hele dag tijdens het knutselen ik vind je video’s echt tof. Blijf zo door gaan topper hvj 💜
1:00 NOT TRUE
Most people don’t realize sugar free uses other things to sweeten them and they are prone to cause stomach issues. It’s not just from joyride candies themselves. Most sugar free items will cause the same issues
If you bought it off Amazon, then you bought fake fake joyride
Yeaaah they’re trippin who ever reviews the feasteables chocolate bc it is SO good. I prefer it over most chocolate and the macros are good AND it’s affordable.
Popped 0*
How do you know what cleaner taste like 😂😂😂
Im kinda surprised that they said that Joyride made their stomachs hurt because Joyride is the only candy that doesn’t give me that problem.
17:34 your hair *is* shiny!!
My brother loves Mr beast chocolate 😭
2:16 2:17 2:21 2:23 2:31 2:34 2:36 2:40 2:44 2:47 2:48 2:50 2:51 2:51 2:54
I love how Hope was so excited to try the hot chocolate but ended up not liking it😂😂❤
0:20 WHY RYAN
You should make a video about testing healthier versions of different foods
I'm sure you're going to learn this the hard way, but sugar-free sugar products if you're not used to eating them act as a diuretic. That includes sugar-free sodas, sugar-free candy Etc
Not surprised that Aphmau products   are not here.
I love those cookie's❤❤🎉
I love when hope does these videos and I am gluten free 😭😭😭
Ohhh I love Cassey!!!the clothes are amazing and she is so sweet❤
"taste awful. I can't believe I supported pokimane in this process. Here I was thinking I would enjoy them but NO. These taste like astronaut food. I can barely taste the chocolate. Pokimane, do better" OUCH
RYAN IS THE BEST

For Xmondo color you should try the dye it is semi permanent it can stay up to a month if you just leave it but if you go In the ocean or in the pool it will come out and if you want it out you can use vinegar and by the way the blue is the strongest
you look prettier in straight hair than curly
Actuly the feastable chocalet one is kind of yummy
OMG love the hair what were the pink hair go LOL
The James  project is cute but …..
Any one here on January 1 2025👇🏼
Please try my dads tea it is called Sri Gardens tea ☕️
Please try my dads tea ☕️ it is called Sri Gardens Tea
9:39 maybe don’t blow dry it and let it air dry
Try the hot chocolate with  warm milk
Maybe as an video idea u can ask famous YouTubers  to send a free item of their brand and test it and give ur opinion! (I know im watching this vid very late but i love too watch older ones!)  -Demi❤
14:55 I’m allergic to nuts and the dairy milk one said it didn’t have any nuts in it but it made me have a reaction 😢
9:47 your hair looks so good straight!!😮❤
The old chocolate bar i Like
What is your dog’s name
You now that's 27 cence per cookie
Me and my bestie had similar hot chocolate based off on how you described and felt bad because the worker kept falling asleep and looked as if she was in college but we drank it because we felt really bad😀
the emma chamberlain blue matcha tasted fake and vile imo
Umm hope how do you know What cleaner taste like????
Team 2024
You should make a video of kall me kris souer candy  and  purple stars  02 lip sest
Can you do a house tour please🥹
Hope i think in the hot chocolate you should add milk instead
My nose almost exploded with laughter😂😂😂😂
Just saying with the Joyride candy every sugar-free candy is like that because of the replacement sugar so if you eat too much of any sugar-free candy, it causes a laxative type reaction
I almost exploded with laughter😂😂😂😂
No the dog is so cute at this moment 10:17
Hey, Hope I was wondering if u can do all 5 star rated things x
hold up you heat water with an pan and not a tea kettle O__O
The mini blender should’ve come with James Charles’s PAINTED no doubt
Whenever I see chamberlain coffee anywhere I'm like how's Emma man !!! It's been long
I thought the phrase rug candy was good though and I love that guy. He’s funny.😢😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ I hope you notice this comment.
Joyride gives you diarrhea because of fake sugar
15:14  my fav chocolate and I love the new one with penutbutter ❤
I ate a hole bag a joyride with my friend and we didn’t know who made it but we didn’t go BOOM!🤣
Okaaaaaaaaaaay, but I've tasted all the chocolates that Mr. Beast sells.And I have never tasted worse chocolate in my life.Maybe I'm just used to the taste of European chocolate, and in America its chocolate is really the most delicious, I don't know, because I haven't tasted any other American chocolate.
Why are the being so mean to ryan😭😭
Just put milk in th hot chocolate prms it will B sO much better xx
There's fiber in the candy guys. It's just fiber
2:08 my name is Alaina it is also spelt the same way 😂
Slay
I cannot get past boil water in a pot! Do they sell kettles in America?
1:20  her face before the biggest mistake 😭😭😭😭😭😭
11:59 James Charles got one stars on this 😮
9:51 it looks really silky in my opinion
If you are trying to have shiny hair I know everyone has different  hair but honey deep moist shampoo makes my hair pretty shiny
I ate Joyride without going "BOOM" before
My name is Nikki
I just want to say this because you said that since like you never really liked gluten-free cookies I have to eat gluten-free cookies if I want to eat cookies because I am gluten-free I'm just I can't eat gluten which is very sad me and my brother and like ever since I found out I was so sad cuz I can't eat a lot of things that my friends have in their lunch and stuff like that cuz I'm only 9 years old right now
Hi hope I just lost my best friend to cancer she had a brain tumor I really miss her please respond she was 9 and im 9 I really miss her
Ты знаешь, кто любит тебя больше всех? Всемогущий Бог, твой Творец. Бог любит тебя настолько сильно, что Он послал Иисуса Христа, Своего единственного Сына, умереть на кресте, чтобы твои грехи были прощены.  Ты знаешь, почему Бог любит тебя так сильно? Потому что Он — любящий Бог, сотворивший тебя по Своему образу. Твоя душа бессмертна и ты очень ценнен для Бога.  Иисус любит тебя, но Он ненавидит грех. Грех огорчает Бога. Грех отделяет тебя от Бога. В судный день (а этот день близок) Христос скажет грешникам: «идите от Меня, проклятые, в огонь вечный, уготованный диаволу и ангелам его», а праведники пойдут в жизнь вечную.  Мы все грешники и были осуждены на вечный адский огонь. И все же Бог любит человечество, сотворенное Им. Он искупил людей через смерть Христа и теперь, благодаря этому, мы сможем быть с Ним в Его Царстве.  Иисус умер вместо тебя. Он не хочет, чтобы ты погиб . Но Он хочет того, чтобы ты жил вечно с Ним на небесах. Только доверься Ему. «Ибо возмездие за грех — смерть, а дар Божий — жизнь вечная во Христе Иисусе, Господе нашем».  Подумай, как сильно Бог любит тебя. Он послал не одного из Своих ангелов, чтобы спасти тебя; Он послал в этот мир Своего собственного Сына ради твоего спасения, потому что Он любит тебя. Иисус сказал: «Ибо так возлюбил Бог мир, что отдал Сына Своего Единородного, дабы всякий, верующий в Него, не погиб, но имел жизнь вечную». Бог свят и справедлив. Он сможет принять вас только тогда, когда вы покаетесь и поверите в жертву Христа за свои грехи. Иисус сказал: «Покайтесь и веруйте в Евангелие».  Покайся, веруй, что Иисус Христос умер за твои грехи, и прими Его в свое сердце как личного Спасителя и Господа. Бог омоет все твои грехи кровью Иисуса и полностью очистит тебя. Слушай и читай Божье Слово (Библию) и Святой Дух изменит твою жизнь и даст тебе новое сердце. Он освятит тебя и наполнит Своей любовью, радостью и миром, мудростью и силой, а также научит тебя жить для Его Царства.  Слушайся Бога, Который так сильно тебя любит. Покайся и обратись к Богу сейчас. У вас лишь ОДНА жизнь, и она может закончиться ВНЕЗАПНО; вы не знаете, когда и как. Однако, Бог по своей милости дает тебе шанс подготовиться к вечности. Он воскресит тебя из мертвых и будет судить тебя по твоим делам. Думай и действуй сейчас. В момент смерти вам придется предстать перед Богом, Его судом и вечностью!  Признай, что ты — грешник. Ты нуждаешься в Избавителе, Господе Иисусе Христе, Который избавит тебя от твоих грехов, чтобы ты мог избежать Божьего гнева и грядущего суда. Попроси Бога прямо сейчас простить твои грехи, произнеси Ему молитву от чистого сердца. Он всегда готов услышать тебя.
( I didn’t see that it dont any different then the others I bought). Was crazy I didn’t understand any of that💀
On the hair product your hair looks like 3 percent shiner then it did before maybe it depends on what hair you have idk 🤷‍♀️ maybe later your scalp will itch idk
I will do 100 push ups for every like this comment this gets
Okay but why does Hopes makeup look like something Chappell Roan would wear 😂
😅
0:00  satisfying
2:59 she got that gyatt
That scream😭✋- 12:05
11:48  says 5/5 but puts 4 stars
The joy rides are good
Do the best rated items 😊😊
why it's arabia bruh 😭.
The hot chocolate tastes bad because you used water😭no matter the hot coco if it’s water it’s gonna taste like dirt. Use milk and it’ll be so much better
When she ate the third one my stomach started to hurt 1:46
4:37 her dog just chillin in the back round 🐾❤️🐾❤️
The hot chocolate is supposed to be mixed with milk not water !
At 7:58 min of the vid that hair product at least the hair color. I have a purple one and I’m obsessed and it makes my hair amazing and the purple is just so shiny so maybe you don’t use the shiny one maybe use like a colored one like purple or pink❤😂
You should try giant joyride
Wirdo
My daughter uses Monday shampoo mixed with Redkin all soft shampoo to get soft, shiny hair
Why?! James Charles he’s horrible!!!
You should rate 1up again he came out with more flavors and the candy look so different
Emma Chamberlain’s blue. Matcha was so sweet and also she had this amazing tea but she doesn’t sell it anymore and I have no idea why she kept all the other ones it had like I don’t remember what animal it was on, but it was so good and I drank it every time I was sick 10:24
Hi
Hi
I think the joyride candy contains stevia. Stevia gives a laxative effect to some people. I guess that's why some people had some issues
You were pretty generous with your likes lol. That hair shine foam didn't work at all and you gave it 2.5 stars lol. How was that worth giving a 50% positive review for something that not only doesn't work, but also seemed to be causing harm to other people who have tried it. In my opinion, something that dangerous should only have been given 1 star.  That being said, I always enjoy watching a beautiful Queen inside and out sending out positivity to your viewers. You are intelligent, beautiful, powerful, positive and charismatic.   You make all of us women look better... Which is becoming more and more important given the self entitlement that is apparently everywhere now that we have a whole generation that have grown up never truly having to save up, or even wait for, anything. Whether it's getting things delivered same day or buy now pay later schemes etc etc. It's no wonder people are becoming so much more entitled. I still remember when you had to go through a catalogue and get videos/ dvds delivered to you before you could watch a film. It could take 2 weeks to get it, or spending 24 hours and a fortune downloading a film through dial-up... And that was cutting edge! Even though I'm only 33. The 'get things now' culture has exploded exponentially since 2000. And since people have absolutely no patience anymore, they don't treat their fellow humans with any patience or appreciation.  Which is why we can only rely on champions like you to show people being an adult can still be fun while behaving responsibly towards ourselves and others.
But milk with the got chocolate
Feastibles are just... meh for me. It was fine, it just wasn't as good as say Lindt or other chocolates in similar price bracket. And of course with current knowledge of some of his behavior, it makes me glad I didn't care much for it anyway.
I watch your videos when I was born
People came in the comments to see if one of the YouTube's commented 👇
Uh Hope, your nail fell off 😂
7:39 they look so good
1:00 the only reason that happens is because it has biotics in it which Is kinda like a laxative
Your supposed to put milk in the hot chocolate not water😭
You didn’t pick up FaZe rug
Sorry but it’s 28 cokes in the 4bags 4*7 =28
I get that James Charles is just NOT it. But the video was about 1 star reviews. Obviously his brand had 1 star. She had never tried his stuff and wanted to test it out. Chill please..  Edit: would i spend my money on that? ABSOLUTELY NOT. But again, she just wanted to try it out.
You needed to put milk in the hot chocolate instead of water
Hi!
I love brad mondos hair color. Never used the super gloss. But the color is great for me!
Ryan’s r god
joyride is freaking nice, just as ryan himself, love him, love joyride 🙏
Joyride is not one star ???
1:50 baha
girlie i think they meant three packs, not three singular. Singular. gummies…- 😞😞
Why do you know what that taste like ?! 1:51
I agree with Amber and ham I don’t know if that’s how you pronounce it
this hair color is soooo nice on you, until now ive only seen videos of you with pink hair, but this style suits your skin tone and eyes so much!!
Omg RYAN TRAHAN'S JOYRIDE IS HEREEE (I liked them but yeah ifykyk problem thing BAHAHAH)
Please don't financially support Mr Beast or James Charles. Predetatory behavior is gross.
I can’t believe that turkeys are 7$ this year  Let me guess you don’t believe in Santa clause too
“the whole popflex community rates every product so incredibly high”  -only 4 reviews on every product shown😂💀
Omg I tried the hair cream to make our hair shiny and it worked cause the creator of this
Maybe the said the hair shiny thing is bad cause they maybe did not do the instructions right
You should try putting lemon in the blue matcha, butterfly pea is ph reactive . may not taste good though idk:)
The blue flower is better with honey and lemon,its a very good anti oxidant
Why don’t you just use a wig🤦🏿‍♀️
The fact that you supported james charles knowing hes a predator is extremely fucked. I love your videos but youre giving money to a predator. A video is not an excuse.
The feastables in canada dont taste bad but the ones we tried in the states was nasty, bitter and no flavour
I
I had pantene level shiny straight hair as a kid. Do not recommend. It escaped from any style you put it in and refused to hold a curl. Yet somehow it always managed to tangle into a rats nest on the back of my neck during sleep.
Они очень прикольные!)❤️🧡💛❤️
CAN YOU DO SPACE CAMP OR FRESH LOVE?!
What kind of dog breed is your doggy😊😀😁
Roses are red violets are blue I liked my own comment cause no one wants to
Hope deletetion day is coming on December 21
WE ❤ JOYRIDE
Was this just a 17 minute advert all your yt mates asked you to do to help boost their sales? Did anyone else fast forward the James Charles part? I'm done giving that yt my time. By the end of this video I was left with sour taste in my mouth ⭐ star out of 5
Please fix the various range of sound on your videos! I have to turn my volume all the way up to hear portions then get blasted when you cut to next product or scene. Makes it hard to watch!
You are so creatively talented for someone who doesn’t have a job as a makeup artist you really do so well. In all your creativity it comes through.
9:01 İ can tell natural stuff for shinny hairs
HOPESCOPE I JUST WANTED TO SAY UR THE BEST YOUTUBER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi i love you
If they are 80% less sugar they are 80%, more artificial flavors, colors and fake sugars which will give you diarrhea, nausea, etc.  You are probably too young to remember the potato chips that we're supposed to be good for you because they were made with olestra well. Olestra had to put a label on all of their products because it would give you Juicy toots.. or leaky bowels as they called it.
I have tried all of these things trust me I feel so sick. Wait you waisted money on James Charles 😮
3:00 not trying to be rude or to make you uncomfortable but did you photoshop your butt? It kinda looks photoshopped
I am gluten free so I really was surprised about those midnight cookies being gluten free and I would try them but they are way too expensive for me
The QR code for the eyeshadow palette booklet is so creative! ❤
That haircut looks so good. Whenever I tried it. I like the brand.
Hi hope scope
I tried the Cherry ropes and they were sooo good😊
Omg I freaked out when I saw her natural straight hair???? It’s so pretty!!!!!!
2:08 lol my name’s Alayna just spelt different😭😭

No, there’s no way joyride could overcome sour strips through the best
If James Charles react to this and say I’m the worst person in the world, I will hate you even more if you like James Charles get out my face
I hate James Charles
0:20 Just watched one of his vids. Love his vids but especially yours too. ❤

You look like Meaghan tranior lol 😂

Hi hope love your videos

she added water to the hot chocolate 😂😂😂
you released your clothing line on my birthday
Ih
I don’t think so I think it’s a good thing to do that I don’t know what else I could possibly get out there to get the stuff out there for you to get done I think it’s just a little bit of a waste of time and I don’t know what to do with it I don’t know if it’s going anywhere I think it’s more like an emergency or something like this or if you could do that and let them do whatever you need I don’t make sense?
Bro🙏🏻😭💀
Bro Mamy branches the lumpatious🙏🏻😭😭💀
James Charles 😭😭😭😭😭😭
😐Yeah that's good
I will do 10 sit-ups for every like this gets please don't like 700 or 800 or 100 cuz I don't really want to do that much push-ups
I love how Leo smells everything lol❤❤😂❤❤😂❤😂😂❤😂😂❤❤❤❤
Hay im  glutenfree that's ofensive

Hope scope you should try
When you came out with you seamless set ,it was on my birthday 🫶🏻
GYATT
14:09 The white line may have been thinned by applying the black line after?
13:54 Pinstriping brush or try cutting bristles at an angle?
The Brad Mando product looked pointless
Lot's of Too Faced palettes comes with an insert showing how to do different looks.
RU VA su suck 😂
Rating the YouTubers (no hate to anyone. I’m just stating my opinion please don’t get mad at me in the replies. 1 love 2 loveeeee 3 never watched 4 never watched 5 again, never watched 6 she’s OK. I’ve watched her a few times. 6 used to love him, but not really anymore 7 loveeeeeeeee 8 i watch him sometimes
As a person having hair which was damaged coconut oil helped
joyride is really hit and miss
Try adding milk to the hot chocolate powder instead of water ❤
If you want your hair to shine you have to put a hair oil on after you curl your hair. You do that for about thirty days and your hair will shine. The product is called KLASSE
the blue raspberry is purple because to make it truly blue they would have to use artificial dyes and its a clean candy.
Can you do a vid where you spoil your dog for one day!
day 1 of trying to get 5k subscribers 😁👍
Figs are known to make u go to the bathroom
The thing is I can’t eat gluten so I have to eat gluten free cookies every time I want a cookie
I`m literally drinking the blue matcha from Chamberlain Coffee as I watch this 😂 I love it somuch tbh
This my mums account but my name is Rhea (Think of diarrhea!
hi hope I Love your viveo
12:22 THATS IT!
15:54 “my wife is more sour” HAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAH😂
1:11 the candy does not do anything but fill your stomach i promise i ate 2 packs and nothing happened just a full stomach
Midnight cookies by pokimane r getting most of the hate cuz she copied it from a Costco cookie
3:00 GYATT😂
3:05 love itttt
Xmondo is really good
You should write perfume
14:24 ummmmmmm
6:41 NO WAY THATS MY NAME!!!
I did not go boom. -HopeScope 2024
🤣🤣🥤👕
Feastables made me sick
5:42 the makeup looks so good!!!❤
ryan’s candy looks so good
0:50 with some sugar free products when you eat a lot ,  that often happens I doubt it’s just this brand but I’m not sure !! Correct me if I’m wrong ❤❤
Hi hope if you need a good hair shine product I recommend the Amika moisturizer and shine cream
I adore that white lacy shirt you are wearing in parts of the video!! Need it for myself, so cute.
I love you you give people chances
Wouldn’t be grossed out if you tried my mom’s cookies sadly she doesn’t sell them, but I think a lot of people would really like them
Love the video ❤
2:54 It looks so cute tho!!
I’m eating a Fiesta Bowl well the Fiesta Bowl is on.
Can you test temu products pleaseeeeeeeeeeee
My fave yt is Ryan trahan

Hopeeeeeeeeeeeee😭😭😭😭😭 your hair is so preppy natural with no curls😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤
Joyride isn’t a bad
hopeeeee!! i love you but did you have to give money to a predator? 😕
9:54 it didn’t change just took the curls and made it I tiny bit shiny lol
I love the backround so cute and the vid 😊
Hope scope where is the giant poof for the giant make up?
✨Hi SiStErS✨
Aham
Joyride, is delicious for a no sugar candy
Hi hope🎉❤❤🎉❤❤🎉
I have never seen you without pink hair
Ow seney
Slay
Bc it’s white eyeliner she is using
1:51 have you tasted cleaner??? I have so many Questions now…😊
Big fan here. But Hope, don't know if that hair shine treatment got a fair review. You can't really judge it on hair extensions. Even though it's human hair, once removed from a person's scalp, they lose the ability to hold moisture and shine.
I love ryannnnn yalll he's so cool weird and funny
Joyrides are gut candy
the answer for "how do you get the line so small" is nail art brushes or many of the indie eyeliner brands like suva or glisten or my personal favorite holograves cosmetics sell really thin brushes for lining and for art
It looks dryer.. 9:39
To be honest hope, I love you so much! Your content is amazing!  You are so amazing. Anytime I’m going through something I watch your videos because your beautiful personality makes my days amd nights so much better. Love you hope! Thank you for always making the best content out there 🫶🏻
Glad to see it wasn't only me having that issue with Joyride sticking in one big clump. I just starting taking bites out of the big ball cus I couldn't pull them apart cleanly
I luv her so much
Not her dog just being like “ I’ll eat them for you” in the first one😂
I LOVE COUGH SYRUP 😢
I think you should do a snack hack video like if you guys agree and want that
I love Cassie ho
hi hope for the next video you could do futrestic outfits or items btw I LOVE YOU your my idol AND yeah hope you have a good day\
When she did the makeup i thought she did an amazing job she did a better job than i could do.... 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I love you hope scope❤️❤️😊
❤❤
YOUR THE BEST YOUTUBER !EVER!
Loved how you did the orange in James Charles product,you slayed it
i feel the same way about the🥰 feastables!
This is so interesting
Fr 0:26
I believe that nikkis white line could be achieved with a white eyeliner
Your hairs so pretty when its flat❤❤❤
Feastables are disgusting, we bought every flavor walmart had to try and all were bitter and just nasty. Honestly the worst chocolate bars I have ever tasted.
You got scammed with the James Charles make up paint
Hi hope you should do a review on candy bars or chocolate bars
Hope you have some of the best videos ever❤🎉
Hope I had The gummy bears they were horrblie
I saw a video of James on shorts and he was being mean to a girl and I’m a girl 🥺😭😢
HopeScope!!!!!!!!!!! OMG i have been a fan for years (2 years now) I love your videos SOO much and my dream is to see you in person I hope you get to 5M!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I think this is amazing. I love you. Hope you’re the best. I just love you so much and that looks kind of weird but I still love you. Bye.  5:29
Hi somebody a couple years ago said they would rather watch James Charles then you
um hope how do you know what cleaner tastes like???
I loveeeee your videos
😂😊
I feel like I shouldn't have clicked because I love Hailey Pham. Don't dis her husband
Hey hope! You should make a vid with all of the times you have been scammed lol❤
I love your videos
I know what you should use. You should use native shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair shiny for some reason, but my hair is not dry.
0:03 and so.e of these youtubers u dont know!
love ryan trahan..
'😮
I bought some and I was for real scared of having to go to the bathroom during the movie, regardless I didn’t actually have to do maybe it’s just different body types.
The dog keeps looking at the makeup and joyride is like so cuteee❤️❤️he's so cute❤️
Hope there is a way to get ur hair shiny with just shampoo and conditioner get ur hair wet put conditioner in first put it in ur hole head and wait 10 mins then use shampoo And put it in ur whole head then rinse it out the you put conditioner in only on the news after the shampoo
JOYRIDE! RYAN TRAHAN SUPREMACY!
Your next video can you do a house tour?
There's more than one company named joyride
I wish hair products gave clearer instructions on how much to put. I always put wayyyy too much 😭
Loved the video.   you are equally beautiful and funny 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The comments where they say you go boom it’s just there body and how it reacts to different things
oh and for graphic liner you need a super fine brush that had longer bristles so you can drag it not a short patty brush
okay but seeing as its made with butterfly pea powder if you add lemon does it go purple?
5:05 THATS THE MOST GENIUS IDEA ❤❤❤
2:12 I thought you said ho3 for a second and I was like WHAT-😭🖐️
I love ur hair
I love Ryan Trahan and faze rug ❤
If y’all don’t like James Charles why are you commenting abt hin

No no
Joyride and feastables should not be in a one star video

Love the vid 😊❤🎉
Try kitchen hacks and things
My name is Hope and it always makes me feel so special
7:45 we call them tiny teddys in Australia
It’s the first ingredient, corn fiber, in the joyride candy that can upset your stomach.
Joyride is perfect for skipping school
Sugar less candy is known to have sugar alcohols and some if you eat alot does ... activate the bowels
Idn, if it tastes awesome the laxative effect may be desirable in some circumstances.
I love your hair when The front peces  were pink and it was short.  But I like it the way it is now 💓💞💕🌺🌹🌷🌸💮🏵
Hi Hope!  I love your videos and your name is so pretty!!!💕💞
Until I go boom😂😂
Español
the music in this video was so loud and bad .....sensory load guaranteed
wait i live in muskegon and my mom's name is tammy... wow
i love your videos and i think you should make your own snacks based on what you like
Hii hopescope I was wondering if you could try Plouise it’s a British lipgloss company and omg i love the packaging I hope you can get your hands on it because obviously you live in America but yeah if you did end up buying it would make my day (I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS ME AND MY SISTER WATCH YOU ALL THE TIME!) ❤❤
15:56 my wife is more sour lol
Joy rides contain 3g of Fiber so that's why ur bloating 1 star reviews
ViDeO

Jesus loves you and died for you 🤍 so you can be set free and know Him personally 🤍 In Him is the fullness of fulfillment & eternal security
Never buy the feastables they taste so bad

👋 Hi
Hi
Oh no I already have IBS so I’ll Skip the first product lol
Wow, why would they see these reviews?😮
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
JESSUS FOLLOES
I love your videos
Reason why the pokimane cookies are so underrated it’s because you can get them at Costco literal Costco
Maybe try air drying your hair than blow drying it  8:07
Jesus loves you!
You should do all five star reviews from YouTuber products
I think eating those snacks was a bad idea. I hope that you won’t get the stomach ache by the first. Candy you . ..in the video
ok hope sorry but the emma Chamberlain hot chocolate probly tasted gross becues you used water not milk
Hank and Henry did paint tube make up first
Maybe you can make a best reviews YouTube products video and see why their so good
I love the Mr.beast bars and it is not at all bitter!!😍
Hope you do not need shiny hair 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Mr beast had got sued 😢
I need joyride now
This comment can’t get 5 likes 😢
I love joyride:D
Hi i am gluten free and offended
You need to try putting a darker color in the corner and side on your lips and a white in the middle then mix it together
warming water in a pot and putting it in a mug via ladle is WILD. do you just not own a kettle?
For all of you guys hating on her for trying james charles makeup she was trying the product not based of the person..
the joyride candy gives me the haribo gummy vibes. there was a haribo gummy that used that type of rare sugar and it can make you have diarrhea.
Hi Ryan Trahan? Well when I was watching his part a suggestion came up for him
James Charles ripped off Halsey’s brand with her about face paints. Her products are absolutely superior in every way and I would never give the JC groomer a dime of mine
Gurl when ya Goanna die ur hair pink😂
JOYRIDE!!
I love hope straight hair its so cuteee 🥹
Nooo. Fâse. Rug
Chocolate drinks mixed with water are just... yuck.
Tried my first mr beast feastables with my son. We both like it. It's better tasting than hersheys bars no offense Hershey's bars lol 😂
1:06  NOT true I ate the whole bag  And SOO good
The butterfly tea if you add a lemon to the matcha it will turn purple
James Charles😬🫣
The reason why if someone eats really badly and has something healthy like a lot of fruit veggies they can get poo and fart a lot cause there body’s are getting rid of all the bad food cause fruits and veggies have a lot good stuff in them the fruit/veggie is getting rid of the toxic things on you. You can have anything healthy for this to happen      Pls correct me if I’m wrong on anything
Ryan Trahan has not yet released his candy at stores so it is just a scam idk what to call it   Read more…..
Hey hope I’m a huge fan and was just wondering if it would be a good idea to do a real products vs the dupes???? Just wondering love you girl
Here is a good product that gave my hair shin lúcido-L  ARGAN RICH oil
Can you try to make a video about trying famous gummies😊😊 love your vdios  😊😊😊😊😊😊
where’s 5 minute crafts?????
If you want to achieve shiny hair, you can use paul mitchelles super skinny serum ( idk if i spelt that right)
You have the best YouTube channel ever
NEXT VIDEO IDEA:try every barbie that was banned ever
i tried the joyride ones there so nice but there just like those rainbow sour strips kinda :)
the reason why ryan trahans candy are “diarrhea, gas, and bloat” causing is because they contain allulose which is commonly found in figs and raisins which are foods that make you 💩. it is a natural sweetener for people that dont like to eat sugar, that’s why he puts it in his candy. but it has many health benefits! anyway, you should try the joyride lollipops, they are so good and dont make you…fart as much 😀
Did u go boom 😅
I still support james and his makeup brand is amazing! <3
Hi i love your video's❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You should git a eye liner stamp in One of your videos😊
Can you do a mini brand one   One of each kind   Like pets. Books. Toys. And more
I love you Hope but the fact that you supported James Charles in this video is actually disgusting. That man is a predator, and he is not ok so pls do not support him in your future videos if that is ok
Ryan’s sour strips are made by him and they do not make you go BOOM! Joyride is cancelling their other candies and only selling Ryan’s
Do you know the hair problem thing you had with the cream well there is the  TRESemmae brand xx
most candy that is "healthier" for you causes stomach problems my dad has to eat sugar free candy and not just that brand but pretty much all "healthy" candy causes this problem.
Can you make a cheep make up vid plz
Social media is one of the most toxic things that was ever created and if I could go back I would wish the internet never existed.  People give one star reviews for personality issues, not liking the person it's so nefarious.  And then you have websites like Bath & Body Works which incentivize reviews for giveaways and everybody gives everything five stars.
ahhhhh your nails!!! they are soo prettyyyy!!!
Wondering why i have so much flatulence... had to come back to this video to remind myself why.... the joyride candy is so good, so i ate a whole bag, and now i can't stop... 😭 please help.
Is it just me or does anyone else think that hope’s hair looks gorgeous
Loved the video until I realized u were supporting James Charles and Pokimane in the process...one is a child predator and the other called people broke for not being able to afford $28 mini cookies that were just bought in bulk from another company :/
0:17 WHO DARES TO HATE JOYRIDE?!😡
The first review on joy ride was made on my birthday 😂😂😂😂
you kind of look like Magen trainer  lol
Sugar free items will cause stomach problems that’s why they cause diarrhea and gas ur only supposed to eat one or two sour sour strips
I love gluten free food
14:31 can u show some of ur paintings
Hi you should do 5 stares YouTuber stuff sevens u did 1 star YouTuber stuff     It just feels right todo it
I’ve watched you for so long, my friend sadly left somewhere that I will so we probably right, but able to see each other again but watching a channel makes me remember her know she didn’t die but I’m still kind of sad that I can’t see her
People who love Ryan
Time to get rid of the tracks…. Your hair is too long for your height.
Yes blogflex has good reviews but it only has like 4 reviews???
Roses are red, Joyrides are true, If you like stomach blues, Then this candy is for you! (True = real, not fake.)
You really put James Charles up there?  Wtf
I feel bad for the dog give it candy
O.M.G😂
Joyride is currently sold out… don’t ve a trahan clout chaser
❤️🥰😊😍🍭🍬
Hi hope I think your next video should be about 5 star reviews
The paint kind of reminds me of the glossier cloud paints.
I hate the chamberlain coffee but I hate oat milk
Hi☺️
7:44 SHE SOUNDS PRETTIER (No offence to her normally)
3:27 Your taking yourself with yourself
It's just heart-breaking that Americans don't get blackcurrant flavoured sweets.
But but I love fazzrug
I had no idea what James Charles was accused of before reading the comments for this video, so dont feel bad for reviewing a product that happens to be from someone whos less than reputable.  Love your videos, glad ive wandered across them :)
JOY RIDE?!
I had The Ryan trahan gummies and that was like the sugar free gummy bears all over again 😭 no hate to him he’s a great YouTuber but those things were fowl
U should Go live
Can you come to my birthday party 5/11/24
Never eat sugar free gummis
Wait how do you know what cleaner tasted like nvm we have all accidentally licked sanitizer or some chemical 😭
The seamless set you came out with is the day of my birthday 23rd October 🎉
You are. Wrong
Hello
All sugarless sweets gives you diahrea. To make it edible, they add an ingredient that creates a laxitive side effect. So it's not the Youtuber's fault.
proud of a predator?
I am in my dad’s account, but I really like coffee even on eight years old
Why do you always raise your pinky every time you get something you do that weird pinky thing so weird
15:03 it was so good tho I had some me self,u were right ppl were trolling,they probably mad they are not mr.beast or mad they do not have as many likes/subs/fans as him❤
I’m gluten intolerant
Predator paints,it’s a no no from me
Do you no enee win you slepe
Allulose is a sweetener product approved for use in the US. It is not yet (as far as I can find) approved for use in the UK, much of Europe or Australia & NZ. It IS a natural product when sourced from plums/prunes and similar dried fruits HOWEVER the product now sold in US stores is NOT made from these fruits. Instead it is made from corn by-products. The chemical composition of the original allulose is then taken and re-devised in a laboratory using other (artificial or natural) products with the main ingredient being corn by-products. It usually uses several different products to make up this same sequence. (By the way, this also happens to almost all the vitamins, minerals and other supplements that you buy from a health food store. These products take the chemical makeup of each vitamin and recreate it using several other food and non-food products. You have to look high and low to find nutritional supplements that are actually made from good quality food sources.)  Everyone, by now, should know how corn by-products have been tainted by their modification in laboratories. High fructose corn syrup is one of the worst products for your health. It can trick vital organs into thinking things are okay or not okay. This, I'm sure we'll eventually find out, will have astronomical effects on the body and on whole populations. You can barely look at a food product in the US that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. I don't believe in it as a food-worthy product. I'm pretty sure that this is why it is still not approved for use in so many countries.
Hi use me as your lov the video button  ❤❤❤😊
Let's get her a dimon play beton
6:41  litter they had my name it is the last one it’s pronounced as me leen a
hi
Hi
Hi.hope with the hot chocolate thingy I’m pretty shore you’re meant to put milk in stead of water than put it in the microwave
Do a my  favorite brands
Why do Americans not know about things called Kettles ! Hope for your hair ask for them to put on a semi permanent tint on at the end of your highlighting so that you have glossy hair. Also speak to your hairdresser about products or maybe go elsewhere as your hair shouldn’t be stripped with no gloss just because you have bleach in your hair. I have very light blonde highlights and always get a semi permanent tint on at the end sometimes just to enhance the blonde and sometimes to slightly colour it like a very light baby blonde or right now it’s a little copper. I do go to a very professional hairdresser who uses 20vol only and I have pretty dark hair. And I always have glossy hair so there are plenty of options to improve the hair game. Also I always use super professional products like wells, Kerastase, redken, ouai and nothing cheap and nasty on my hair.
Why?????????? ??????????
🪓🧨🗡🔫🔫🔫😊
You look like Megan trainlor
I have an idea  What if you mix products to make new ones?
Hi I’m Harper I’m one of your biggest fans

My name is Hope
I’m  pooping right now so I’m going back in a minute to get my haircut but I’m on the toilet💩
please don't promote the predator paint
The Joyride candy probably has a lot of fiber. Could be why reviews mention passing gas
Hope Try  Torlls  Stuff   Please  i  Love your  videos 😊😊😊
Iirc, the yellow color of the painted collection is the worst of the bunch. Like it’d flake within minutes
I want try those cookies link please
Hi hope please can you do a live stream
OmLord!!! I have the Xmonda Super Gloss in my hair right now!!!! Oh no! I’m watching this while I wait. I do LOVE his wavetech products are amazing for my curls! Oh I hope this works too 😮

I would love to see you try out theory wear!
I watch Ryan’s videos
Who is waching in  2024
Hi ❤ my name is Rae
The right one look cute ❤😊
It look shiny so cute hire 👄
Hope if you want a good hair product to leave your hair shinny you could try the drunk elephant conditioning  leave in milk it’s pricy but SOOOO good and definitely worth it
12:29 I have a lip balm bigger than that lol 😆
Hair dryer that you use for that YouTuber was the exact same one that I have😂
i’m quite sure the reason the hot chocolate from chamberlain coffee is gross is probably because you added WATER instead of milk😭
i love the qr code you should tag her
I love how she said how proud of the creators she is 17:43
I think it looks less shiny
so 1.14 grams of sugar per cookie
This made me crave candy i was eating it the whole time 0:00
Hope is the new queen of nice❤
Hi Hope! You used what looks like a philbert brush. You need a tiny angled brush actually. You can get them for eyeliner brushes. Make sure to use dove soap as a conditioner to smooth out the brush extra thin. Trim if needed. I say this as an artist who discovered partway through this is by FAR the best brush for straight lines or tiny dots. Sometimes it’s easier to add a dot from the tiny pointy tip and the reconnect. All the best! :)
Hopescope:"lIpGlOsS" Me:"WHAT... she has a accent what?
Have you tried the best rated products in their brands?
I miss the old Mr. Beast peanut butter bar. I don’t like the new one— the taste is off to me but the milk chocolate is so good! Such an improvement.
She spent 84 pounds on cookies on cookies!!!😮
Waw🎉❤😍❤️❤️i Love this so much 🎉🤩😍❤️
How can I dm you and send you a PR package from my small business? I can't message you anywhere 😭😭
You look pretty with your hair straight. You should keep it that way from now on.❤❤❤❤🎉
Oh my gosh, I love your videos. Thanks for making this.❤❤❤❤❤
Do not be proud of James Charles PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
I don’t like chocolate but I like Mr beast chocolate
I love all the youtubers- idk why
Your production quality is excellent and you are very entertaining!
@bradmondo
Really disappointed not only did you include a known self admitted sex offenders products but then endorsed them, gave them 5 stars, and gave them free promotion to a large audience(the majority of whom are likely minors), and didn’t once mention that he is a predator. If you don’t think it’s appropriate to mention sex crimes against minors in your content then don’t review their products
I have celiac (can't ha e gluten, wheat, etc. So I eat gluten free) I'm a child and can't order stuff but I go to camp thats for Cealiacs. I love when gluten free stuff or coach is mentioned
Should have tried the hot chocolate with warm milk, not water.
My high school best friend her sisters best friend was a panting model.. it was never the shampooer conditioner it was always oil on their hair. Oil ... 🎉
Any candy or beverage made with steviolglykoside instead of sugar or honey will make you fart and get the brown water. Same happened to me with waterdrops (the cubes that make your water taste better). One cube per day was okay-ish (Yeah, I farted), but 2 gave me the brown water. So be carefull what you digest.
People how Pause the video on the first Product to see the whole review on Amazon  👇
45 years old and I'm still laughing hysterically at farts. 🤦‍♀️
Catalina Crunch "oreos" are v. v. good!
I'm a regular mondo product user and love all the products I've used. Shampoo conditioner and temp hair color.
Skye’s
L love you so much 💗  😊😊😊 and L wille think You should do for😊 your Videos Paint some make up and see if it's summer😊😊😊
Next try 5 stars products
Y’all joyride is 4 stars
CAN WE PLLLEEEEEAAAAASSSSSEEEEEE HAVE MORE OF LEO
I am always a little disappointed by your ratings because I feel like U always rate everything way too good maybe that's because U wanna remain attractive for sponsoring or because money isn't worth as much to you as it is for other people because you have a lot (good for you no hate there) but I feel like U never really think of how much some of these products cost and how inconvenient they are (not just in this video but in general) Seems a little out of touch for me and also a little morally wrong because U can influence a lot of people into more consumerism
I would rate the me. Beast new bar a 1 at First i thought it was good until i ate the whole thing i hated it it was súper sweet
Leggings review! Old school Hope! I still wear my Pursue x Hope leggings and bra!
Your hair is pretty shiny to me. Those commercials use lighting to make hair look shinier
The glow hair thing worked but you just have to wait😂
Ryan does one star reviews all the time and now someone is reviewing his one star product 😂😭
Something I noticed about the “less sugar” candies is, they are LOADED with fiber, and it’s easy to eat a lot. Especially because it’s marketed as “sugar free”
I like her with srate hare
Brad mondo’s hair colors are the WORST. Box dye lasted more for me. I got one day, followed the directions, spent hundreds for all the products suggested from XMONDO. One day of color. I was complimented a lot that day, but one day before orange turns brown, or purple turns yucky, or blue or red. I’m keeping my virgin hair now but 0/10. I adored him and left a five star review after the first day on the orange but that died quickly.  Edit: ALL THAT BEING SAID that was MY experience. Maybe somehow my common hair type is less common than I thought. I just feel bad being honest but I can’t waste money for my chestnut blonde to turn to a green brown.
My cousin is called hope
I never tried the og feastables (they had an allergen of mine) , but I tried the new ones (no allergen). In my opinion, it reminds me of Walmart's Great Value brand chocolate chips. It's not bad chocolate, but it isn't something to rave about
You should do a video where you do a one star makeup product and go to the ten stars make up product
I love the video!!
Not me seeeing your extensions the whole video 🫠 girl dry shampoo the top layer of or you hair…
Do the sour candies have xylitol or sorbitol? I know those have laxative effects. Xylitol gums are popular in Finland since they're actually good for your teeth. But a whole bag of candy at once would be a terrible idea lol.
I love hope she makes me realize that I don’t have to look like a supermodel to wear what I want
Sugar free stuff tends to make ur stomach upset…
Girl you slay Meghan Trainor
If you regularly eat fiber then eating some fiber candy shouldn’t make you go boom 😅
Buy one star fake nails!!please I really would enjoy it!❤❤
Like your visit 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Puppers needs credit in this video ❤
Fazrug tried to call you for a video
i love your video and I'm subscribe
You need white eyeliner
You’re one of my favorite Youtubers
I love how her dog looks like he/she wants to eat everything
Honestly I think the worst youtuber products are the ones that make drinks
Guys, lets not hate on the creator, hate on the manufacturer
5:50 actually kinda looks cute they just jealous cuz they not mr beasts and faze rug r the only 2 i know u gave the stars cuz u felt bad
Literally everyone should know by now that you shouldn't overdo it on the sugar free candy. Joyride is a sugar free candy, of course people felt sick when they over ate it.
I hope everyone appreciates what you put yourself through to show us these products, but you also need to be careful of yourself!
Bro she makes me laugh so much ❤
I always have to make hot chocolate with milk  it tastes so disgusting when it's made with water
Thats how long it takes to blowdry your hair???? 😵 It takes me like 45 minutes. So I just don't lol
is it just me who realized how photo-shopped her brand's seamless picture was. Did you see how much bigger her butt was? Why would someone want to show all of that off? I love your content! Your also VERY pretty. I love you hopescope. Keep p the great work!!
I have tried the Joyride in the past and it did make me gas and bloat up, but not the "other" extreme. I threw them away because I don't want to be gassy every time I want a treat hahaha It literally lasts for hours after eating only a couple... not for me!
the hot chocolate with water?????
I Think the problem whit the food is that it is different for everyone. So I think those one stars are mostley just personal taste.
Not James Charles 🤢
The shiny line you were trying to create I’ve usually seen it created with a long thin makeup brush not a small short one and they drag it :) also love the joyride update ❤❤❤
Those who came from TikTok can like this comment
But I feel like the reviews are just hating like your ratings were so good like….WHAT??                                                          Btw I was subscribed for years now notifications on! Love youu <<3
Wowsers
I’m YouTuber and it’s called in Kimmi’s world
Great video, love to know about the different products sold by other Youtubers. Very entertaining. Also, you had friendship bracelets? I wish I would have known that. I would have loved to buy one.
Some reviews are pretty pathetic horrible and shows only hatred towards the stars which is bad because if you don’t like one thing doesn’t mean whole world will hate it so kindly learn to keep your thoughts in your brain and let others enjoy
People don't understand that zero sugar stuff has chemicals. Obviously you will go to the bathroom if you eat too much. 😊
I LOVE YOUTUBING
How did Mr. Beast's chocolate go up in the amount of sugar???!! That's just ridiculous!! I definitely won't be buying it!
How many knives does she have?
Emilee❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉Boow
Mr Beast Feastables taste like all American chocolate, bitter with a side of vomit. It reminds me of Hersheys 🤢.
The little raisin dude was so cute
Yeah no, i went “boom” only once, and i ate all four joyride packages 😂❤
Your hair at the end of the video looks SOO glossy! How funny😂  It’s very pretty
Hahaha, the low sugar items. The fake sugars always make your stomach not happy 😂 I avoid sugar where possible and some of the fake ones. NOPE. Eat very little at a time. Lol.
You turned your eyes into tide pods
Haha the dog want something to 😉😊😘
15:25 I read new as ew
How the dhirrorea HELP
Your doggo is a real sweetheart❤😊
The thing with PopFlex is that Cassey takes all the feedback and makes changes.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Your white line 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hot chocolate With water is a Crime
God is with u he loves and cares for u no matter what he will bring u comfort and joy no matter what we all do he will always be there for u no one knows when Jesus will return or when we’ll die so be ready God created all things can’t just appear😊❤
Use a nail art brush for white eye liner 😊
Who makes hot chocolate with WATER?! Use milk and try again <3
Support James was a choice ….
If I were you wanting to get shiny hair I would highly recommend the biosilk hydrating shampoo and conditioner
Those sour gummies have 8g of fiber. It’s no wonder they make people go boom 😂
7x4=28
Not Bolgotis get them of you cover page
Hot chocolate with WATER?!?! 🫣
Leave a like to give me luck for my emacs tomorrow please! "I'm scared!"  "Not begging for likes" please!
James Charles is a creep, he fakes his makeup too, don’t believe everything you see.
I thought Ryan trash and joyrides were 5 stars
A long time seeing her hair straightened
Because the creator is horrible person we shouldn't like the makeup he makes even if we like it? Ok
awe bro
Hehe i thought we were talking bout the king in england...........

Glossier also has a product similar in a tube like that I think
“Let’s see if I go boom!”… “I did not in fact go boom,” Im dying this is too funny😭😭
🎉🎉🎉🎉 😅 @Sophie💐🪩: God is with u he loves and cares for u no matter what he will bring u comfort and joy no matter what we all do he will always be there for ua
Hope I love your energy and every video you like oh I don't think I'll go boom oh I'm Over great you're the best YouTube ever Youtuber
I’m so glad you did Mondo Gloss because my hair is all natural color but it’s never been shiny. I’ve been thinking about trying this product but I’ve hesitated about ordering it because I don’t have a lot of money to blow
Nikki got a lot of bad reviews because she didn’t have the money to do all the shades we like to see brands do. Plus she’s based in Norway, and that explains the broken English Reviews.
I remember allulose from the 00’s, never ever ever again.
2:02 she didn’t swallow anything
Ok I have dyed my hair with Xmondo and my hair was much healthier and silkier
Hope I have the best best video you might could do is 5 start things and one start things, it will be really, really funny😊
Why support James Charles?!?!
Why is Cassey there?
1:51 hope have you been eating cleaner.......
.2026.
I misssss your Pink hair 💓💓💓   But love your videos 😃
Thank You, i enjoyed this video!!! FUN!!!! Youre very very BRAVE Hope 😊
Hop should freeze dry YouTuber candy❤
I subscribed simply cuz you weren’t negative. There’s so much hate online. I hope this is a happy corner of the internet.
I love your videos so much 😊 14:06
You should had done prime.
5:38 I mean it’s not Nikki’s but slay for like 20 minutes🫶🏻💖✨
4:52 the Meredith duxbury x Morphe pallet also has a small paper with some of Meredith’s favorite looks🫶🏻💖🪩
I didnt know the joyride candies were some influencers, i bought them because of the ingredients and didnt really care for them. Stuck to my teeth bad. I think the problem with the gas is people eating more than they should.
Back in the days the leggings are back
I was always told that Americans don't own kettles but I don't think I ever believed it until now... How do you guys make up baby bottles? Because you have to add hot water to the formula that had been boiled and I can't see every mum boiling water on a stove with a thermometer in it...
Let’s see how many likes this comment gets..
you remind me of kelly from superstore
Bit late in watching this but the end make up when Hope tried to do the white lines made me laugh so much.. And I loved all the other honest reviews.. 👍😃
Hope you’re such a boss influencer ! You are so pleasant to watch always !
Too many ads
Why would you make hot chocolate with watteeerrrrr
The flower that was showed in the screen for the blue matcha tea whatever here in the philippines me and my fam use it to make blue rice 😅
Pretty sure the joyrides are just people all coming together and joking abt how bad it is when its really not, sense he does 1 star review content 😭
The pov from the makeup drawer killed me😂
@James Charles
For those who are mad that she didn’t comment on the allegations about James Charles she’s reviewing the products not the person, SHE IS A REVIEW YouTuber she’s not a controversy YouTuber who talks about drama, if you want that go watch the news or something.
Cap.
Okay just saying not trying to sound brady or anything but my hair is always kind of been shiny and what I use is the Ozzy miracle hair moisturizer and it makes my hair feel really nice so but then again we have different hair types was
Astronaut ice cream gets to much hate😢
🥞
😮your hair in the end segments looked really shiny.
with the mr beast bars i liked the old one better
Thank you for putting the name of “butterfly pea” powder on the screen to avoid confusion! 💁🏼‍♀️
THANK YOU for not including your eating noises when trying the food related items.
I love the blush colour on you
I feel like withe the Brad mondo product you are supposed to do it with your hair care routine
i hope james charles didnt pay you for this...cuz honestly this isnt a good look
OMG FEASTABLES!!
Gurl I'm pretty sure they were talking about the dehydrated and then rehydrated food that astronauts eat not the freeze dried candy😭   Correct me if I'm wrong.
White Eyeliner
My nephew loves the Feastables chocolate...but I think it's only because of Mr Beast.
I used x condom and it wasn't pigmented. A I also used the painted brushes and it peeled and the hairs broke off.
Wow
Nah rug didn’t deserve that
When u made your seamless set it was on my b day
I HAVE NEVER HAD JOYRIDE BUT I WANT TO TRY IT
I like how honest and authentic you are. You try to see everything from a positive aspect. I’m sad about the James Charles part, although I am able to separate artist from their product…anyway, I’m happy I re-discovered your channel.
Wish we could’ve kept James out of the video because of his past - just sad to support someone so controversial
2:07 MY NAME IS ALSO ALAINA
not trying to be rude,but she can't say that it's bad cause people spend their time and money on it just for people to rate them
I love you and jams ❤️ ❤️
alaina is my name   but  i  did not do it
I use mondo color ones and love them my hair is so soft.
Hi Hope, can you try the Chamberlain hot choclate with some milk ? I think it will be much better :)
NO NOT BUTTER FLY PEA TEA OMG MY SISTER AND I GOT SOME BECOUSE WERE LIKE OH MY GOODNESS ITS SO COOL AND I THINK IT TASTE GOOD TO SO WE GOT ITT AND MADE TEA AND WHEN WE DRANK SOME I SPIT IT OUT AND I LIKE UGH YUCK SO DO NOT GET BUTTERFLY PEA TES EVER!
3:11 I love those pants slay
why would you support a groomer?? so disappointed and unsubscribing
Ouch to say you're proud of James Charles 👀👀👀
Should've tried the feastables cookies lol those are some real crap. They're the same as chewing on rocks.
Can u do Benji's makeup products please 🙏
I don't like those sour strips and please don't try pink lemonade worst flavour ever 🤢
I love the new Mr Beast chocolate! Way better than the old formula 👏👏
JOY RIDE RYAN TRAYHAN
Omg that lipstick looks so cuteee
For hair shine use a little Jajoba oil.
Ryans candy. I swear the reviews are just funny.
Why are you buying makeup products from a groomer (James )
yall complaining ab james charles but she said at the beginning “some of these ytbers  u might love or some you might hate”
i think for emma chamberlain’s brand you could add milk instead of water for the hot chocolate and latte. that might make it taste sweeter/milkier 😊
Oh my facking god your GORGEOUS!!!!!
crazy how the comments are all abt james charles omg😭
Well, I haven’t heard of any but the gloss. How ever I hated the gloss.. definitely need to be put on clean hair and it’s not worth the result in my personal opinion. I was disappointed by that.
11:48
How does she know what cleaner taste like
MY NAME IS ALAINA!!!
Please don't support predators like James Charles
come on.. James Charles ...seriously Hope?
Thsse kind of videoss are so nice i love!!
the way she had the AUDACITY to put joyride candy on the thumbnail 😭😭😭
If you think describing diarrhea is graphic, you have definitely not been on the same side of youtube as me 😂
Doesn’t max have sour strips?! Hmmm 🤔
Her videos It reminds me of YouTube back in the day when the platform was fun to watch
Not you brushing your hair when it’s wet…that’s really bad for your hair girly please take care of your hair
Awful content
You should do five stars next
I must say in the final end clip your hair does look superrrrrr shiny maybe Brad’s product does work 👀
Yasss love James charles products he's the best 😍❤
Why don't you have an electric kettle
9:00 pause here she looks like penny wise
ITs just the fake sugar that makes you fart lol NBD, the price you pay to eat zero sugar snacks
BRO ITS SO FUNNY THAT RYANS PRODUCT IS THERE BUT HE IS TOO (cover)
1star? 💀
I don't know who  in their right minds  will try the james Charles stuff  the guy goes around messing with underage straight guys who he manipulates. Hope has a affiliate link  supporting people like him is really not a good look.
Popflex is my favorite work out attire by far. The hourglass leggings are hands down the best in fit, most comfortable, and well made leggings I've ever worn. She slays 99/100, I guess she can't get it all right 🤷‍♀️
Why all the hate for James Charles? What did he do to u??? It’s her opinion ok!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If u wanna say that say that but she had her opinion and u have urs. OK!!!!!!!!!
You guys keep commenting stuff about  James Charles she might not even know  I don’t even know…
Hope, buy a kettle
Stop being so rude about Ryan trayhan sweets there perfectly fine they sold out in one day so you can't do anything about it so stop being so rude
This is nice!
9:46 it looks dryer HAHAHA I don’t think it looks that different.
Your hair!!!!! Gorge 😍
What’s wrong with James Charles?
Hope kinda looks like Mary from young Sheldon with that white outfit.
I love your content, I've been watching videos everyday for the past two weeks. You give me hope that life isn't so bad when I feel like I have no one. Thank you hope.
i LOVE ryan im so glad you reviewed those
I'm honestly shocked about the PopFlex reviews; knowing Cassey, she'll listen to her customers and fix it!!!
Hi Nikki!:)
PLEASE do a life in a influence
Not the predator paints.
Wait, I haven't try any Chamberlain products but you are never supposed to do hot chocolate with water😂 that's like a crime! It's with hot milk
ANY candy that is X% less sugar is probably made with alcohol sugars that cause gas/tummy upset.
Not surprised you’d support James Charles tbh
Why are people mad about James Charles but not poki like bruh just enjoy the video
Reviewing a *child predator’s* makeup is giving major ick and is disappointing.
People rip on Pokimane because it's a rip-off of Toatzy Midnight Mini Cookies.
About the Feastables, they were both good to me.
11:27 💙💙💙Mmm, I taste Percy Jackson vibe💙💙💙
why do you cut the video literally every time before you put the candy in your mouth? were you tryna make it look like you didn't actually eat them?
Mr. Beast's chocolate is NASTY!
I did not go boom. 😂😂😂😂😂
blue matcha is not actually matcha! matcha is made from the tea plant (sinensis). butterfly flower/blue pea flower powder is NOT matcha, it's just a flower powder. there's no caffeine content like there is in true matcha or tea.
I haven't tried the new feastables but the old one tasted like hershey's chocolate syrup.
Not getting a like for the predator brand review, your only video I didn’t hit like for
as for the brad mondo shine product, the reason everyone is having such a bad time with it with their hair being greasy and stiff is because they’re using too much. his products are extremely concentrated so you don’t have to use very much. hope that helps if you decide to try it again! also his shampoo and conditioner is fantastic and it smells amazing!
did nikki use eyeliner? like a white eyeliner (i’ve seen my cousins do similar things with white eyeliner)
Good video
I wish James Charles wasn’t included
I love how hope scope managed to ruin her makeup but then also to salvage it and make it look very good
I really love chamberlain coffee especially the macha  I have one it is the best macha I ever tasted plus they are fresh   but do not get the latte only the normal one with vanilla powder if you want
Oh, Predator paints, that's a no from me
Sounds like those sour gums were made using a diabetic recipe😮
I must say, your hair looked really shiny at the end of the video, when you gave your final comments.
I would say James Charles gets the bad reviews.... because he's a predator regardless of if his make up is good or not. Can we pls stop giving him money?
James Charles? Really?
Her using a LADDLE to pour hot water in her teas instead of using a kettle is crazy to me
I got an ad for some stuff on pop Flex a few months ago and I bought one of their rompers and I have absolutely loved that thing
I subscribed! I also love this video 💗💗
You should review rare beauty products
Can I say one thing I don’t hate anybody I dislike them no offense
You should try Pop fit leggings! I love mine!
14:56 the original ones were so good i loved the crunch one 😢
11:38 i thought she was going to say blue 😭😭
DID U JUST PUT WATER AAND HOT CHOCOLATE TOGETHER?!
I really like the joyride candy’s bc I have diabetes and they taste really good (to me)! ALSO ALL SUGAR FREE CANDY HAS SPECIAL SUGAR WITCH WILL UP SET YOUR STOMACH!
You sound like Amanda Bynes low key
her extensions popping out lmaooooo
The  brand sunset  makeup  water activated eyeliner is cheaper and works really well.
Most sugar substitutes have laxative affects in them if you eat too many, so if you have a handful sugar free gummy bears you’ll be on the loo for a while lmao
So happy to find you through this video!!
Amazing video ❤
I thought younger people were concerned about the planet. What in the heck is the purpose of that paint can other than to be cute?
If you now more than one tick-tock er 👇❤️❤️👋💕
2:58 GYATT
Why is Joyride on the thumbnail? It’s not 1 stars
What's with the pot and ladle for boiled water?
Hope you should make a video about I try YouTubers candy 🍭🍡🍬
Hi hope love Ur videos Ur so inspiring and funny
The background music is too loud and annoying
In my opinion, I don't like James Charles products period bc they just aren't good. I saw that Ulta had a James Charles pallet and brushes on sale and I was so excited to use all the vibrant colors, because I was good at makeup and wanted something brighter and more vibrant to do a whole face look instead of just eyes and I kid you not I couldn't even get the shadow to show up on my eyes let alone try my face. I was so sad but the product was such a disapointment.
Ok the joyride is not 1 Star i think cuz it ran out of all in like 5 days
So I think there's a difference between people who have done questionable things, maybe made a bad product, and James Charles who's an actual predator. Icky.
The James Charles support need to be addressed. This ain’t it Hope. How can you just ignore all he’s done and bring attention to his products? Even if it’s one star. So disappointed.
WHY ARE WE SUPPORTING JAMES CHARLES?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Things with less sugar usually have artifical sugar stuff in it and that causes bloating and diarrhea and stuff if consumed in large amounts or if consumed too fast. So thats probably the reason
no mention of james being a predator? just gonna promote the product and move on? we see you..
I love your videos
Pop flex is soooo expensive!! I would absolutely love to buy some pieces from them it I can not afford it at all!! 😂😢
But the eyeshadow look❤
Me waiting to see if she is gonna “blow up” 🍿😂
babe one thing you look goooooooooooooooood  like seriously the white dress and the makeup you look like a whole show
I don't understand after all that he's done people still platform James Charles. Please don't do it.
I miss the pink hair
I did not know you were a painter like gurl pop off
I personally LOOOVE the old Mr beast chocolate. The newer ones just don't hit the same lol
Don’t brush your hair while it’s still wet 😭 9:21
My name is Alaina but I did not post that 😂😂😂😂
I started using beachwaver about a month ago. And it's the only products I use in my hair. My hair is so much healthier and shiny. You should try the beachwaver hair care products. 💕💕
So I will just say this. As a Type 1 Diabetic the chocolate bar from Mr Beast does not spike my numbers as bad as anything else. After having his bar its hard for me to get the reg stuff as its like my numbers jump sky high
Ooff, didn't realize Painted was included on the intro, had to click out of this one
At 3:00  gyatt
You didnt put milk in the hot chocolate😢
You should do a 5-Star version!
U have talent
I really wanna see you test some craft kits! I love a craft kit so would fun to watch! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👀👀
I love your contents hopeee!! Keep the good work up:>> 🫶🫶
Hi hope love your ❤ videos
I really like how you ended this video on a positive note, supporting other creators is the way to go 👯‍♀️
Where was this anger when Onision was exposed for abuse, or shabe dawson and his cat, and Jeffree star. Y’all can boycott Starbucks but can’t stop watching a YouTuber 😭 sad
A lot of artificial sweeteners have been known to cause stomach issues so thats probably the problem 🙃
The MrBeast chocolates are actually quite good. Y’all are savage.
The candy probably is made with that ingredient they used for chips that was a laxative.  They marketed it for less sugar and healthy with less fat. Of course it was because it went right thru you lol
Predator paints, this disappointed me
Loooove how she keeps her intro so short✨ straight to the point diva
.
14:36 the bad part is you’re not supposed to use them on your eyes, but James doesn’t tell you that.
Shes wearing the Presson nails from the video where she buys things from subscribers shops secretly
They are so small
Awesome
Willing to bet the Sugarfree was made with Sorbitol. It will give you gas and more. That is why you never eat sugarfree gummy bears
Heyy
If you don’t like gluten free stuff I’d still recommend the gluten free double stuffed Oreos I was gluten free for a while and those helped me make it through😂😅
The gas is coming from the sugar free additive. That’s why it’s “healthy” because it has this alternative. That’s why haribo’s sugar free gummy bears are so infamous. They use the same sugar alternative
The milk chocolate from Mrbeast LITERALLY tastes like DARK CHOCOLATE.. WHY
Nikki ❤
I'm confused I couldn't hear her for like half the video💀💀💀
Pls can you rate Pigeon dolls line of  accessories
she said she did not really do any searching about the youtubers stuff she prolly didnt know about james.
She did not go boom, ya'll. Yippee!!!
Using water for hot chocolate is actually criminal 😭
L’Oréal Paris hair oil cola with elvieve is the best
Genuinely thought the sour candy one was like, edibles. The packaging is so weird 💀
Is that a real beauty blender by the brand beauty blender or is it a make up sponge?
Including the booklet was very common in the '80s and I'm with you I'm very surprised she didn't put a QR code
10:34 wtf just buy a kettle
I don't know if anyone has told u this but you look so like Spencer pratts sister in her younger years no idea what she's like now but u are her double so pretty x
Hi
HOPESCOPE you roasted ryan trayhan how dare you (im sorry)
Please test cécred by beyonce !!
finish your mini dream house that actually works
Not James Charles…..
Hope maybe you should. Do I bought ringtone shoes
i hope your not gonna say bad things about ryan im writing this before watching
8:56 you should have done it in a wig but great video u always cheer me up
HOT COCO NEEDS MILK
Thank you hope for spending your money and time for us we love you so much 💖 And your dog makes me laugh 🐕💖
Didn't know that poki has snack product😮
Omg such a good idea for the QR code ❤
I love your videos and I think you should do a how many famous people can you do in a day 🎉
Hi  can you do Amazon Japan they have cute things there
It’s funny bc when the Mr beast chocolate came to Australia I tried it and bleugh! I hated it😂. Aussie chocolate is way better
I actually love the painted brand,, cause it does help me with my cosplay makeup
Honestly why are celebrities and influencers always making their products soo expensive?
Sometimes, even if the product is great  it gets bad reviews because of the owner. For example: James Charles..
You should buy taylor swift dresses if you like her
I’m sorry but ummm.. at 3:01 in, the pic of her in her own seamless set (cute set) vs her live on treadmill🤔🤔? Something is not adding/ matching up. Photoshop/ pic enhancers are really getting their use **bombastic side eye**👀
my daughter loves watching these videos, and her name is Hope too. She also has a dog named Leo! She says that you are the best and that her and her friends are inspired by you, and love you so much.
I just saw a tik tok about how millennials love QR codes and this speaks that truth
Hope please stop supporting predator paints 🤢
Im sorry but i can support anyone saying J.C. name at all. This video just got bad regardless of him learning or not. Its a big big big no. Hope im disappointed in you
Y’all need to grow up and stop with James , It's in the past I feel like he said sorry, and admitted is wrongs if god forgives if so do l,even if he did wrong, l was SA'ed also but I forgive even though he was wrong !
One of my family members is dying... makes me happy to watch hope tho. You make me feel better❤
QR code thing is so smart!
Your hair looked really shiny at the end though!
Yall it’s not necessarily the sugar substitute in the candy (for Ryan Trahans new candy) it’s the fiber!!! One serving is 8g of fiber for the sour strips😵 . There’s 4 servings in a bag….which is only 16 strips of the candy. Yeah, you can’t mindlessly snack on those. Ask me how I know 😂
I avoid anything that’s advertised as “less sugar” by using alternatives like allulose, sucralose, erythritol, etc. Those weird sweeteners are a trigger for IBS, which makes sense why there were so many reviews about stomach issues. I’d much rather just have real sugar and not an insane amount of it.
Who thinks her hair is DROP DEAD GORGEOUS ✨👑
How does she know what cleaner tastes like 😂 🤣
Girllll no. James is a no go sis.
Will you will do 55k push ups
idk why but i would have totally washed my hair. just to feel clean. some instructions are just weird to me. like now i gotta wash my hair because the next day is hair wash day. 🙄
If u add lemon to the blue matcha it should theoretically turn pink
As always Hope fun and honest, I love how you acknowledge your peers on the work that goes into getting a product to market.  Bye Hope thank you
I thought Mr. Beast chocolate was legitimately bad. I'm not a mr. Beast fan or anything but I was kind of excited to try it. I got the peanut butter one... It tasted like ammonia!!!
Guys... She can buy produts from whoever she wants. James Charles' brand is actually very good and creative despite you not liking the person. People do not know the full story. James said that he asked them their age, and they said 18 even though they were 16, just so the boys could get some quick clout. Later on, James found out their real age on their social media pages and stopped talking to them immediately.
lol my name is milena too just my youtube name is mika so people dont track me down
You should do more Taylor Swift, and thrift vids.🙂
When will you be live again Hope?? I have always wanted to make one of your lives!
Please can I get a shout out because I really lolly love you r videos biggest fan ❤️
When you try the hot chocolate you should try it with milk instead of water. Btw I LOVEEE UR VIDEOS.❤
the  makeup for a staged bed after thought video lol
The idea on the QR code for the makeup was a major missed opportunity!! You genius!!!
I really like you and i hope you inform yourself on James Charles because i really dont want to have to stop supporting you too
Where does she get her money?
3:00 gyatt
What do you take a magic please take a message to Miranda
Hope!!! you should try a wavy hair routine!!!
Glossier has tube blush
use white eyeliner for niki eye shawdow :)
I saw so many altoids at target.
Hope I literally love you!!! I have watched a lot of your videos in the past month!!!! Love: Bailey ❤❤❤
the affiliate links that pop up make me iffy
poor americansXD dont know what good chocolate is lol since moving here ive been so sad with you guyses sweets lol everything tastes bad lol
for the hot drinks. i wonder if it could be coconutsugar. i cant handle stuff with coconutsugar
Omg
I am still flaber gahsted that people are actually sensitive to sugar free candies like anytime I have one or someone talks about it its all like omg ur gonna have the craps or be farting. I literally have ibs and celiac and I have yet to experience this when Im already more prone to crapping and farting.
Why do you have his advertisement on your video? It takes away from what you're doing. Did he pay to do that?
I came from Snapchat!!! Heyyyy❤❤ I love
Some people give bad reviews just to hate
That is all sugar free candy.
Every like I will do that many cartwheels 🤸🏻‍♀️
Went from fun youtuber to watch to biased reviews, it's clear she supports her YT "costars" and does 0 actual research lol
I'm confused about what reviews you're reading for Ryan's products. Not only does he not sell them on amazon, he just launched like a month ago yet these reviews are from last year
Isn’t joyride a brand new brand by Ryan Trahan? You kept saying ryan’s flavors haven’t had very many reviews, but isn’t it like I’m very brand new brand? I’m confused.
Another big thing about Pokimane's product was her attitude to people talking about the price.   Mainly something "If you're broke just say so!"  Plus it is just the same kind of cookie you can get from Costco (if I remember correctly) for much cheaper.
i like ur videos but ur too enthusiastic and it gets super annoying a minute into each of your videos
Amen
Having an affiliate link to James Charles makes me genuinely wonder if i want to stick around on this channel.
I think you didn’t like the hot chocolate cause you put water in it 😂
licensed cosmetologist here! my clients loveeeee the redken acidic color gloss! it’s color safe, of course, and works best with the shampoo & conditioner! try it!!
Replace the water with milk for your hot chocolate☺️
James Charles is a predator though, pass
THANK YOU for actually giving an honest review on Painted! All I've seen are people giving it a horrible review just because they don't like James, and nothing to do with the actual product.
Try Kromoda coffee
new  to this   channle but im loving it keep up your good work
I think you’re fabulous Hope, but please reconsider supporting a predator like James Charles.
Hii Can you please try Otto by KallmeKris? :)
not james charles....
literally at the side of this video there is a Ryan Trahan 1 star review video😅😅😅😅😅😅
3:00 Something looks… a little different there 😭🍑
When I saw biogles in the thumbnail I knew it was something off because she makes amazing quality stuff
Candies with less sugar often substitute with sweeteners like xylitol or similar. Those are not bad for the body, but our body can't digest them properly. They are actually quite helpful if it is about losing weight or caring for your teeth, BUT only if you eat them in low quanitities. Your body can get used to those sugars if you eat stuff carefully. I actually find this more of a pro than a contra for these sweeteners, because it helps me to not stuff my face with high caloric foods.
1:51 how do you know what cleaner tastes like...
The gummies probably have too much sugar alcohol.
James really didnt need to be here. I understand youre trying not to be biased but this isnt the best thing. I dont think i can support you anymore after finding out. You also have a affiliate code
The blue matcha is something I make using the blue flower u show. It tastes pretty good
At the end your hair was soooooooooooo shiny 😮
People still buying from James Charles ?
I thought joyride was way higher rated
Love your content but I would pass on anything from James Charles after all the allegations.
Hope scope is just the best😊🎉❤
But honestly, would Hope risk having her colleagues hate on her for giving their products bad reviews? She barely dislikes anything…
Not James Charles, Hope...... That's extremely disappointing......... I thought after all the things he did (which included m!nors), we'd agreed on not giving him money or any exposure.....
One like = one push-up I’m being fr
❤ I really liked your video. I thought your dog was adorable. The Chamberlain coffee products were interesting.. I liked the blue one the best to be honest 💙
day 2 of asking if you could do a video of disney channel stars current brand plss
I cant believe these brands are 1star rated
I love your dress!!!
can i inspire u to try one star drinks at starbuckssss??????????
There are different hair types
Hi, I am a new subscriber
the Blue Matcha Latte reminds me of the drink from Ginny and Georgia, who agrees?
PLEASE read those James Charles komments... I give a thumbs down for this reason.😔
I love your videos, but please don't brush wet hair.  :)  Your hair is beautiful!  Brushing wet hair is very hard on the hair.
is it js me or did james charles kinda copy the “cloud paint” by glossier
Who thinks hope should do a collab with moriah Elizabeth??? They could bedazzle somthing! Or hope could review moriahs bussiness!
NEW SUB
With super gloss, the website says to wash hair with a clarifying shampoo wait for it to dry and then do the hair treatment with super gloss, so it works on super clean hair best. Also I have found when using that I have to rinse it out super well and the rinsing takes more effort than rinsing out regular conditioner. Idk I like it though.
did we even talk about the fact that the reviews from the first brand is from before ryan started to work with the brand and bought the old inventory out?
BRO just let her be😭 She might not have realized that showing James Charles would be bad😭 She might have forgotten the drama😭 And she is just trying to try YouTuber products😭 She isn’t supporting😭 She is just trying them😭
She didn’t even put milk in it. Of course it’s gonna taste weird I’m not even trying to be rude. 11:16
most if the time Popflex reads feed back so they might fix it
My friend got the Mondo shiny stuff and only used it once
Mannn too faced used to have booklets with their pallets.. not sure if they still do but it was so great!
Deplatform James Charles in 2024
Why are you drinking hot chocolate with water?????
I would love to join but I live in Egypt so I can't because we use Egyptian pounds and not dollars
Dear lord the Mr. Beast cookies taste like a potted plant smells. My son asked for them and hit a hard nope. 8yr old boy tossing chocolate and cookies is an absurd reaction 😂 Run don’t walk… AWAY
The thing is, i am so glad that you don’t say bad things about them, and even the ending just made me so happy! I just wish more people would be like you!😊
People who miss her pink hair😭
Helloo   Why dont you try one star makeup, or wigs, or food restaurant, or any country's one star food,
YALL LET HER LIVE. IF SHE LIKES JAMES LET HER. JUST BECAUSE YOU DONT LIKE HIM DONT MEAN YALL GET TO HATE IN HER.I DONT LIKE HIM BUT YOU DONT SEE ME HATING ON HER.
why are all these comments about James Charles is there some hate going on 😢
Not a huge fan of James Charles but I’m not hating
Can you test Pashion footwear?
I have a video you could make Things you thought you could not boy but actually you can buy it
Really disappointed about the James Charles mention/rec
I think the reason people don’t like Nikki’s pallet is because it looks cheap. It’s cardboard and for someone as successful as Nikki Tutorials you’d think it would be more Lux.
Hi
Y'all fr over here getting mad at Hope for supporting James Charels, but what if she just didn't know?
Try Indian food first time 👉👈 please
You should try out the damelio brands
I HATE everything "better for you", "Healthy cake". NO! A carrot cake isn't good for you cos it has carrot in it, it's BAD for you cos it has ingredients in it that makes it a CAKE.
The Nikki QR code idea is brilliant because I would look at the photo of Nikki and wondering how? .. The QR code to a video with that look is genious !!
You look like Megan trainer
Proud of James Charles?? Hmmm
Its her opinion oh the products, you didn't buy the jc product so leave her. Yall really make a big deal out of such small things
I love you so much made my day post soon pls watching this after my Latin test x
If the match a has butterfly pea in it put lemon it'll turn purple
@Brad Mondo please review it
I actually liked the original Mr Beast Chocolate.
Nikki's images are highly photo shopped.
blogilates is NOT a one star buisness honestly shut up
wow just love your videos of both the channel i just new to your channel but from 3 days i have watched all your videos that r even 3 years old my whole watch history is filled with you love you all love from india 🥰😘❤❤❤❤❤❤
Am I late😅
You need to do a shop and do a youtube video of reviewing fayt clothes
I normally don’t make any negative posts.  I do implore you please don’t promote or endorse James Charles.  He’s admitted to being inappropriate with underage individuals.
grabbed a feastable while watching this. they really are yummy
Did not even notice the affiliate link. Hopefully people unsubscribe bc its actually very disgusting.
For making that thin line on your eyes, it's a good idea to buy a cheap nail art brush which are long and thin! 🥰🥰  I think that's the kind of brush Nikkie has used..  Love your videos,  they are definitely enjoyable.. 🤭😋   Thanks for sharing your goodies and feelings about them.. 😁😘😘🥰
YOU SHOULD TRY GLUTEN FREE OREOS
So disappointed to see you giving a predator a platform. There's a reason his products aren't well liked. Smh
Hi HOPE                  I hope you can make this video happen but I have a video request                 I think you should rate or test out kid or teen YouTuber products I ❤ your videos
Do u see the mini knife❤
guys leave her alone abt James jeez
You should try house of cb next. House of CB claimed that Oh Polly had copied their business model, social media, marketing, packaging and presentation (including using the same models and the same locations for photoshoots) such that consumers would be deceived into thinking that Oh Polly was a sister brand of House of CB.
Your hair is looking sooo good I want it!!!!
Sense when did you taste cleaner?😂
Definitely looks more shiny
8 grams of sugar for 7 cookies is insane do you know how much 8 grams is??? That’s like 2 sugar cubes
GUYS. This is just a fun video it’s not about James issues and she might not have even known not everybody who is on YouTube or watches YouTube knows who he is. I have no idea who the rest of these YouTubers are and I watch YouTube all the time. SHUT UP
JOYRIDE SHOULD NOT NE IN THIS VIDEO
anything sugar-free should not be in gummy form. they all have laxative effects and gummies are entirely 'sugar'. it's always going to be a bad time so save yourself the trouble and have hard candies
The chamberlain coffee is just so terrible
Hey
H̤̮i̤̮i̤̮i̤̮i̤̮i̤̮i̤̮i̤̮i̤̮
Hiiiii I love your videos
Loving all james charles comments  Yes hope, that was not a good call at all...
I LOVE ❤️ You’re videos
Girl! The X Mondo product did in fact make your hair look AMAZING 😮 How can you not see that..
Sugar free candies are a toilet's Armageddon.
maybe with the money from the overpriced cookies pokemane can finally afford to stop neglecting her kids
Hope i looked at your nails 💅🏻 and then I noticed that thoses nails are from trying fans mini business that was brooke's mini business
Hey Hope, big fan I’d love for you to test out the brand “IPSY”. thank you
RYAN TRAHAN METIONIED RAHHHHHHHHHHHH
EWW not PREDATOR PAINTS!!  anyone looking for eye paints:  Danessa myricks  About face Haus labs
Joyride, I was VERY glad I was at home when trying that candy, about 3 hours later I was in the rest room and very very glad we have a fan.  Lighted some candles too.  Really upset stomach for a good 4 hours.
I love hop
hope i love you but supporting james charles by buying his stuff.... noooooooooooooo!
At the end Mr beast held her in gunpoint 😂
My diabetic grandpa swears his sugar free candies, cookies, treats, give gas and diarrhea. He will not let my kids try them!
My name is Amara Charles but people call me Charles
Wait? No kettle?
I love the nimya palette its so nice 😍
Hi
It’s so shiny at the top
Hi
Hope hope!!!! I found a dress that I don’t trust it from Jessakea I just don’t trust it they said they have 10 sizes?!?
Can you do the same version just with german products from Youtuber?
Ever thought of doing video of temu clothes /activewear etc haul a lot lf people i know are curious if its good or bad because of the prices
The Mr. Beast bars on Amazon are three for $27. $9 a bar is too much. Also, they are totally unhealthy because of not only the fat content but the saturated fat. 12 grams of fat and 8 grams of saturated fat!
why in 2024 are we still supporting james charles, a predator ???? and then engaging with comments, but supporting all the criticism about you giving money to somebody that likes children is crazyyyyyy
I love candy
11:48 5 or 4?😎
For those sugar free sour candies, a lot of them can cause upset stomach in larger quantity due to the way sugar alcohols digest. When they said they ate 3, they meant bags, I bet. The whole bag would likely upset your stomach 😂.
16:09 “there it IISsss” in small caps 😂
My understanding is that the review from Nov 2021, when known as Project 7. 1:05 In 2022, the company rebranded as JOYRIDE, which is when Ryan came on board and focus was put on vegan candy.
noooo wait were the gummies like haribos sugar free gummy bears? NOOOOO
With the hot chocolate wouldn't it taste better if it was made with milk and not water
Off topic you looked super pretty with your hair left straight.
Hi
I tried Emma Chamberlains canned coffee in Walmart and I took one sip and thought I was going to spit it out
I wanna start a campaign: where she wears her hair straight. when she does those 70s curls they’re just not fitting her. I wish she just stick to shoulder length hair. I think that would work really well for her. Click the like button if you want her to see this, so that she just tries to keep her hair straight.
That was fun now let’s leave James Charles out of it next time 😂❤
With the gloss by brad mondo, try two shampoos scrubbing your scalp really well at first, rinse all of the foam out of your hair, then lightly towel dry, put the gloss in, leave for recommended ammount of time, rinse out and lightly condition your mids and ends, then rinse.
12:44 Trisha Paytas undercover
What you’ll seriously drink hot chocolate with water?
I'm sure a lot of bad ratings on LGBTQIA+ owners were just people who didn't even try the product and only rated it bad because they don't like the owner only because of their sexual orientation.
Can you now make a video for 5 stars?
Why on earth would you intentionally eat something that others said gave them diarrhea?!?
I bought a palette from Smashbox about 15 years ago and it came with a booklet showing how to create different eye looks. It was very helpful!
I just had the Beast Bar. Fair Easter egg milk chocolate.
I love your straight hair
I really love how you were unbiased and gave your honest review. Love you❤
I support all the YouTubers definitely not an easy thing to do. I love Emma but I’m very skeptical about her coffee! But I’ll give it a try. 😊
Oof. Wish you didnt include James!
How did you manage to get the feastable case filled with chocolate?
You did amazing on the eyeshadow
The Mr. Beast chocolate bars taste like any other chocolate bars. It is so expensive for a chocolate bar that tastes like any other.
I'd give some of them 1 star just for the wasteful environmentally unfriendly packaging.  I know this junk is aimed at shallow people but still...
So I've been wondering if you could play all the Squishies in the world and one of your videos❤❤ love your best fan Natalie❤❤ I love you
the way everyones hating on James
I was so confused at first when she used a pot to boil hot water and then realised kettles are more of a Aussie thing lol.
Alloulose Is not the issue with the gas... Is the fiber.. Most people don't eat so much fiber at once... The other sugar free your low sugar candies do the same thing if you eat too many.... I guess I lost might have effect on some people... But it's been a stable in my house for years and never an issue.....
At the cookies I could eat them because I’m gluten free 😊
Joyride broke my heart. They used to be called project 7 and made all these crazy gum flavors that I loved but then they switched to just low sugar candy
Your my fav YouTuber I’ve joined all the give always but haven’t got anything
Really sad I have to unsub. I enjoy your content so much whilst working but, I cannot support you when it comes to James Charles. He is an admitted predator.
It is so wildly disappointing seeing you respond to all of these comments, but not to any of the ones mentioning that James Charles is a predator who went after minor-aged boys. He admitted to it, it's not even alleged at this point. What do you even gain from doing this, I'm so confused.
The reviewing, buying and commenting what you did about James Charles pallet was pretty tone deaf in my opinion. But ya know, support predators 🎉 I really like watching your channel but this rubs me the wrong way. I hope you at least address this in some kind of post or comment.
When you read Ryan Trahans reviews the candy you are reviewing is not the sour strips it’s the gummies. The strips have good reviews
Hi Hope!  I enjoy you and your videos very much...but, lets be honest..Leo is the true star here! :) ! He is a true scene stealer, just nonchalantly nosing around. So adorable!
I LOVE LEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Only  OG Hopescope fans can like 👍🏻 this comment
As a Brit it’s so weird seeing an Americans version of ‘tea’ lol everything looks so wrong and weird 😂
omg! That eyeshadow look made you look like katniss Everdeen!
I love you Hope but I don’t know if I can support someone that supports James Charles…
Hope: I LOVE mini stuff! Also Hope: oh... The paint tubes are so tiny  Also also Hope: 5 seconds later: OMG THE PAINT PALETTE ARE TINY   !   ! 13:09                                              O
Sour Boys, ftw!
I'm disappointed in you, Hope.  Do better, please.
Why did you have James Charles products and praise him????? Don't you know what he did? He should not be given any support or attention and you are advertising him!!!
I don't know how you feel good about supporting James Charles. this is disgusting.
"I did not go boom" 😂
5:25 yes the photo is okay but definitely a tutorial would be great 👍🏼
𝓐𝓷𝓭 𝓘'𝓶 𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓮 𝔂𝓮𝓪𝓻𝓼 𝓸𝓵𝓭
I have struggled with the "shiny" hair too. But I found a hair oil from a small brand Fable Beauty that gives me shine, and smells amazing!
Hope has a huge part in my daily positivity dose😊
Why don't you try hot chocolate with milk
Hope you should Try the oh polly × Bratz clothes
can you review pink friday nails??
for the shiny xmondo thing i would recommend straightening your hair after to make it shiny x
Please, don't support James Charles.
With the hair shin gel, I would recommend Neutrogena, specifically the blue and pink shampoos and conditioners. Don't use the green one though because it has tree oil, making your hair more oily instead of of fluffy and shiny.
I get the video idea but im bummed she supported james. :(
12:01 I’ve seen that a lot, but I am a makeup artist and a sfx makeup artist, so I’ve seen and tested a lot of products, haha
What was the 2nd one she tested on the treadmill.  The workout clothes
8g of fiber in 4 strips…probably where the stomach issues are coming from
Sugar free candy is KNOWN to make you crap your brains out. Its just a no no on all fronts.
Okay here's an idea. Compare European chocolate with American chocolate
You soo need an electric kettle
Totally not going to read through ALL the comments, buuuut, your hair at the end “update” was sooo SHINY! So stunning ✨🤩 😎✨
Promoting James "the predator" Charles to your 4.28 MILLION subscribers is incredibly irresponsible. You have an amazing and powerful platform that can and has done alot of good. Giving it a 5/5 stars  and including and I am seeing comments about an affiliate link? Yikes. Hopefully you see the comments people have left here and take them into consideration.
17:34 but the way u review.. it never feels like hate it feels like u really want to show the audience the 100% feeling about the products and if its worthit .. your reviews are the besttt no hate no extra buttering no lies just 100% truth.. 😍❤❤❤💯💯
It's the substitute sugar in anything "sugar free" or "less sugar". You gotta get your stomach used to it... very slowly.
You should use coconut oil and almond hair oils for your hair it will make ur hair shiny and strong
Seamless always slides down on me
I got my bracelet!!!❤
hi
according to google  allulose If consumed in large quantities, allulose may cause some stomach discomfort, including gassiness, bloating and queasiness. so you have to eat a lot to get sick unless you have a sensitivity it problem get sick faster
I don't think the people hate the products so much, it's the people who did them.
Can't believe you bought the j Charles stuff.
I was looking for something to watch and u posted perfect timinggg
I was shocked when Mr beast came up cause I loved them all (the new ones, never tried the old ones)
What happened with your pink hair
The candy that makes some people poop reminded me of a time in the late 90s. There were potato chips with Olestra in them which caused people to have MAJOR blowouts! It was not a good time!!  One of my best friends worked at a news station. They always got press packages that had random food. The whole news station was WRECKED! 😂 I don’t know ho they put that news show together and held it together, without people having explosive diarrhea. I don’t think those potato chips lasted for too long.
YOU LOOK SO PRITY WITH STRAT HAIR !!!!!!
It’s actually very refreshing to see honest reactions. I feel like it’s trending to hate things just to hate OR people are fake liking stuff to promote it.
Hey
Really an affiliate for James Charles? That’s disgusting. He’s a massive problem, and you supporting him shows your aright with everything he has done 🤮
The Brad Mondo one, I think you have to use it more than once to see a difference? 🤷🏻‍♀️
" i DiD nOt Go BoOm " I died😂😂😂😂
Could I inspire you for your next video for on tik tok every  liked thing you did you have to by it 😮
I love the positivity at the end of the video. Hope you’re the best!!!
After hearing hope talk about glossy hair, I feel lucky af about my hair, cuz my hair is naturally like the AFTER of the commercial
"I did not go boom"
If some people don’t know but things with “less sugar” usually cause stomach problems
I love your videos . I really want you to try these products
Omg that booklet of ideas from Nimya reminds me of old ABH eyeshadows, they would include cards with tutorials in all the palettes! I kept those for years.
The issue with the Pokimane cookies is more that they are a drop shipped cookie repackaged from another brand ENTIRELY(not kidding, she acted like she worked so hard on the recipe but it was found out to all be lies) & then shamed anyone for being mad with her & called her fans “poor” for not being able to spend $18 minimum on cookies
Give credit where credit is due. James Charles STOLE that idea for the make up paints from Hank and Henry (Henry Vasquez) the orignal creator of Canvas Paints. If you dont Hank and Henry you MOST DEFENTALY SHOULD BE lol. And your welcome because you wont be disapointed for it!!
Omg that booklet of ideas from Nimya reminds me of old ABH eyeshadows, they would include cards with tutorials in all the palettes! I kept those for years.
Can you do a 5 star products video pls it would make my day
I think you should do YouTubers best selling products
💀 GYATTT
I’m gonna need justice for Brad Mondo. I’m sure his products are great you just have to know how to use them
Lol love the Altro, "I did not go boom".🤣🤣🤣
I think you should try sourboyz candy instead
I got Ryan’s candy also and it was stuck together. I didn’t love the flavors but I am use to the artificial candy like many others.
Leo and hope oh my gosh the cutest  U should get all tipes of Nike products please
The joyride candy has sweetener in it the same as sugar free usually made from figs  for diabetics and it gives you the runs and gas as figs are amazing for constipation and are used in a lot of medicine for consideration lol
supporting james has put me off quiet a bit which sucks because i love watching your videos they are such a good distraction for my anxiety. but he openly admitted to speaking to under age boys and i hate that so many people are acting like that never happened. i dont care how much time has gone on this happened multiple times and now everyone sweeps it under the rug.  this sucks i really loved your videos hope but this does not sit right with me at all.
For the food related reviews is EBT a payment option I'm asking for me, my broke self barely can afford rent 😂
Really disappointed by the James Charles love. It is your channel of course, but that's a no for me.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Taking one for the team by testing those 1-star products, so we don't have to 😂🙌 Can't wait to see if the sour candy aftermath is as explosive as the reviews said!
You should do a Mary Kay makeup and skincare review!!!!🥰❤️
i remember when i used to get hope and meghan trainor mixed up 😭
Hey there I found the peelable gummies
Hopescope is a different person with curly and straight hair 😂
the way half of these products are affiliate…
I love it how Leo smells everything
THE AUDACITY TO PUT RYAN TRAHAN😔
The schizophrenic mecha birds keep swooping at my head on my walks :(
Do people not realize that sugar free candy does that to you 😂. Sugar free candy tends to cause diarrhea and gas that’s just the perk of it 🤣
Loved watching this :) The CIA is watching me every single day. I keep trying to get to Joe Biden and I cannot get to him. I have an important message to tell him.
To the people saying this is so genuine and she's not fake, please check the description box... Take all reviews with a grain of salt. People are doing this to make money🤷🏾‍♀️
James is an admitted predator. Disappointed she bought from him.
You look great with straight hair
James Charles and Pokimain's products didn't get the low ratings, they did as people. I wish they weren't included. You could have mentioned it and not bought or showed the products
Most ‘zero’ sugar options will cause stomach issues and diarrhea. Take it from someone who had one too many of her grandma’s sugar free candies as a kid. It’s definitely good, but not like more than one or two!
Love ya hope ❤ and Leo 😂 I would also love to see collabs with Mia maples
Ok here’s my thoughts on all of you saying that you’re disappointed that she gave James a 5 Star Review. She was doing a review of his product and his product only. If u want her to actually review James, so you’re finally satisfied, then ask her to do one. You guys need to stop nitpicking at every single thing. In NO WAY do I think what he did was remotely ok in the slightest way I, however, think that coming at Hope is unnecessary.
WHY DID U CHOSE JAMES CHARLES WHY
Feastables gave me an anaphylactic reaction even tho they said they only had traces 🥰
i lovee you so much and leooo cuteness and so much of t i have a pup and love puppys so much🤩😝😍
That eyeshadow palette looks hella low budget 😅 it screams chalk
The blue tea is for kidney stones 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
James Charles was a bad call to review but I truly hope you didn't know how awful he is
i used the xmondo hair gloss and my hair felt super soft but yeah it wasn’t very shiny or anything afterwards. i never had problems with my hair being greasy or weighed down though so i think the reviewers didn’t fully rinse it out. i will say, the instructions say “apply to clean, dry hair” so you’re supposed to wash and dry your hair and then apply it, leave it on for 20 minutes, and rinse. that’s why it doesn’t say to wash and condition, because you’d be stripping your hair of the natural oils if you did it again
I love xmondo's original wavetech foam. It's the only product I ever use on my hair except basic shampoo and conditioner. Also haven't tried the new feastables chocolate, but I loved the old version. Idk why they would've changed it.
Omg i love the fun dip sticks, they have always been my fave part. Can i just buy the neutralizer.
yikes james charles
You just saved the day. I’m on the treadmill and couldn’t find a video to watch then one last refresh and saw an upload. Thank gosh !!
I love Hope but had to click away when I saw the Painted affiliate link pop up :(
I love how your 4 legged supervisor is hard at work and keeping you on task!
I got the joy strips but I did not get to eat it because my br😊
NAW the review saying “I went BOOM” made me burst out laughing but when you followed it up saying “two more until i apparently go BOOM” was the icing on the cake XD
ooo i loove love this
I like these reviews do more of them they’re fun to watch. Also try that chocolate mix with milk see if you get a different taste then with water. I like drinking any chocolate mix with milk 🥛 but also I warm it up too hot chocolate ☕️
PLZZZ DO a vid of BEST RATED THINGS❤❤❤PLS PIN ME I ❤ UR VIDS
❤
The cups that you used for the tea and hot chocolate, where did you get them at? They are super cute.
if you want good gummy candy, try Sour Boys
“I Did Not Go Boom”     HAD ME FALLING OFF MY CHAIR LMAOOOO
Joyride was nothing compared to smart sweets but if you can’t have sugar they really aren’t bad.. when I was on a diet I ate them and enjoyed. But for the same price as smart sweets I’d get them instead. The sour ones are weird though.. weird coating and not sour AT ALL
For the Brad Mondo product, he says in his videos that, that is the same stuff the dyes are made out of but with no color, just the beneficial parts of the product. You rinse it off because his dyes are meant to be rinsed with water and not shampoo so it doesn't fade off. You can use conditioner while rinsing though. This is more like a treatment so I think people didn't understand the product. I'd like to give it a shot myself.
Hold on isn't that the effect of no added sugar in general
If you put lemon in the mocha it turns pink I’m sure Xx
I find it weird that Andrik And Johnny And Milena Have the Same exact Profile and Color but just different letters?🤔
you should do a video that is like viral sephora products or viral tiktok products!!!
Leo's quality control sniffing 🤣 And yes, going to echo the comments about supporting and putting affiliate links to questionable creators like JC. Puts your reputation at risk.🙏🏾
hope the support for james charles is incredibly disappointing....
Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
hey hope i have been watching since you had 3.5k you've changed my life
I❤Mr beast chocolate
I hate that she used water instead of milk for the emma chamberlin hot cocoa (unless it required water)
Back to Nature cookies are good asl idk what hope is talking about 😭😭
I would LOVE too see a video of you buying and reviewing room/decor/furniture items from Wayfair, their stuff seems too good to be true sometimes! Thanks Hope, I love your videos!
Can I get a iPhone 15 pro max
I love you girl but why did you use water to make your hot chocolate 😢
I don’t think your supposed to put it on your scaLp
Hope I believe that your hair was a lot shinier especially in that end scene 😊
You're proud of James Charles? I wouldn't be. Don't platform known predators.
Can I just ask where did you get those mugs? X
Your strat hair is alsome
There have been major problems with some "less sugar" candys. The substitute "sugars" used cause serious stomach "reactions".
Does she sleep with her makeup on because that's a no-go
Hope ur so pretty❤!
Don’t like James Charles… although by the looks of the comments neither does anyone else.  Was that paint tin JUST for the sponge… what a waste of packaging
RYAN TRAHAN❤😂😂
I need a link to your outfit!!!!! So cute!!!
Where is your dress from?! It’s amazing 😮❤
The Super Gloss treatment, I use it after I shampoo. I use it like I would a normal conditioner. So it sits on my wet hair for 5 or more mins while I shave. I rinse well and I like it for my bleached hair. I add a dash of his purple color to keep my silver hair bright and silver/blonde. Expensive? Yea but how can we have on Brad?! 😂
Ick. I am a casual viewer but I will absolutely not support someone that buys and allegedly has an affiliate code with James Charles.
Love it ❤❤
I love some of Brad Mondo's products, but the Supergloss doesn't work. I even bought a second one just to try. Regardless, they're both terrible. Expensive and I didn't see or feel any improvement. 🤷‍♀️
Blonde hair soaks up light, dark hair reflects light. You aren't going to get the shine that someone with black hair would get. 😊
Wait... WHAT! Hope is a painter! that's so cool!
GYATT 😭😭
Romans 10:9-11  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
Hey can you do a video of all the popular , skin care and see if they’re worth the hype ~ Gianna G.
This video feels disingenous
I always forget Hope is also a painter, and im always shocked at how amazing she is at it
Really really disappointed to see you support James Charles.  What a shame.
Hope wear your hair down more
“I did not go boom” 😂😂😂😂
Why don't you try making a video with your straight hair
✨aspartame ✨
Cane you pls try aynur abbott jewerly, Love youre vids❤❤
PLS SHOUTOUT ME  I love ur vids I’m a subber and the biggest supporter
I want to add to the number of other comments in how disappointed I am that you bought products from JC. Please, you and your team do better and research who you are supporting before releasing a video.
You're so funny, honest n adorable lol 😊
I really love how she expresses her honest opinion about the products so respectfully.
How old were you when you realized that you can copy comments by clicking them 3 times?
The candy lift off Ryan needs a little bit of help they need to talk to harabo and their sugar free gummy bears that hospitalized people lol.
The mood drop I felt when I saw Charles, thats a real bummer. I get being unbiased about the actual product and all, but there's a good reason or two his stuff isn't liked (and they're called minors)💀
U did good trying these out.
Wow👍
Does Affiliate mean she gets paid for these products in this video?
I like the active wear. U look good in them, by the way
I love this girl so muchh!her videos are so entertaining and enjoyable! She always somehow makes my day.❤

I think the problem with the sour candy is that it's marketed as a sour challenge. It's supposed to be the most intense sour candy possible.  But it's just mediocre sour candy. So, it is a scam. If it was marketed as just sour candy then it'd be fine. But it wasn't.
I always love your content. I also feel when it comes to YouTubers and their brands the 1 star reviews have more to do with the YouTuber and not necessarily the product. But you are always fair in your reviews and that's why we love you!
Ilysm sm hopescope your just so kind and not fake at all like idk, your so great hopescope.  keep doing what you do your amazing at it
I LOVE straight hair!!!!
Urban Decay used to release mini tutorial booklets like the Nimya booklet with their Naked palettes, but the idea was dramatic looks you could do in like, 30 minutes.
"I don't think I like this one it taste kind of like cleaner" got me dying 😂 1:53
Hello hope if ur looking for hair oil I would record the sol de Janeiro one it helped my hair and still helps my hair so much
Ummmmm why are we supporting James Charles in this day and age? Disappointing
The blue butterfly pea tea is super healthy look it up! LOVE the show. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi:) im a big fan of u❤❤
Could you please try zapaka prom dresses???
She literally risked her life tasting the joyride candy🍬🤣☠️
Hi hope u should do a video on I asked people to photoshop me ❤
can you do lash by maya
Wow
Nothing makes my breaks better than getting to watch a HopeScope vid.
$20 says the negative reviews from Trisha on the Painted stuff is from Miss Like Fish herself 😂
I love how you didn’t use MrBeast as click bait
Hope, Pokimanes cookies are a ripp-off of “Toatzys Midnight cookies”!
Btw joyride candys gave Lactic Acid which in the name “lactic” literally is a laxative if too much eaten, it is usually found in sugar free candys
Whenever I make hot chocolate, I have to add milk or else I cannot drink that hot chocolate! ❤ I love your videos by the way!
I really appreciate that you commended all the hard-work of these individuals that put time into creating products, regardless if they were good or not - Very aware of you :)
your content is amazing
James Charles has the best brand ever why does no one like it!😠
your a painter?
Hey hope I love your videos, could you please do a vintage makeup testing video.
I’m so happy 😁
Hope please 🥺 do the continuation of working doll house we wanna see it finished and im not forcing im just excited to see the video of it i wish you do that next ❤😊
Some ideas!  Hope & Tyler review cruise ships. Hope does relaxing things for a day. More nostalgic 90s toys. More things out of the house!
Hope, will you please do a test on Sistaco nail powders?! 🙏🏼 😘
I love it how hopescope is doing good videos
Hi hope can you pls review kalde  Btw i love you so much
I didn't know she launched her own seamless collection! You should've advertised it better hope!
Honestly surprised Niki doesn't have more reviews! It seemed like a nice set!
You should do a video about youtber's candy 🍬 🍬🍭🍭🍪🍪🍩🍩   - Miranda  @hopescope
I love your videos ❤❤❤
Omg your contents are really expensive  😂😂
I wish you hadn't included James Charles. He should not be highlited. His actions were awful.
Ur hair really does look way shinier
Trust me all of the low sugar candy/chocolates will have the same affect on you. Always best to be near a toilet!! lol Its the substitute sugars they use in them.  Crazy stuff!
it is not alana i have the same name it is Aa-laa-e-na
9:51 it looks matted to me I don’t know why
YOUR NAILSSSSSS!!!!!😍😍
I am HURT by u saying glutenfree stuff is discusting🥲 I have celiac and have no other option😭 (love u though)💗💗
the problem i have with most youtuber merch / foods etc there super over priced in general for what they are IMO good or not
Okay but the pre shower make up is amazing and artistic
Who else loves hope
This feels like it was sponsored by painted. It’s listed as the first link as well. But a partnership wasn’t mentioned
Hi I love your videos if I pick one of these it would be mr beast chocolate I love chocolate I never had on of these before lol😂❤😊I love your videos ones again and ceep up the good work❤
“Some of these YouTubers you might love, some of them you might hate”   And some of them have messaged multiples minors and been a huge creep.   *coughJ@mesChárlescough*
These products is for not everyone cuz your body is unique in different ways so some of these products is not gonna work for some people but work for others it’s literally on the person
Hope... your nails are STUNNTING, like wow just wow.
Your hair does look super shiny at the end update x
Ilysm sm hopescope your just so kind and not fake at all like idk, your so great hopescope.  keep doing what you do your amazing at it 💗🙏
Not to focus on just your appearance, you’re an awesome and talented creator,  but I have to say that your hair looks amazing straight!  It looks great curled too, but I bet you would look gorgeous with a soft blowout.
11:45 the stars for the green tea are marked wrong lol
Pls review RAYN. Really wanna see your opinion!
There are certain artificial sweeteners that will cause digestive upsets for some people. It’s not the fault of the candy company. People have known about the sugar free gummy bear phenomenon for years. It’s not a new thing. The key is to eat the products in moderation until you know how they will affect you.
Disappointed you spent $ on anything from James Charles. He doesn’t need any air time. Even for showing off his one star products…   Love you and your content sweet girl. Just think he’s not the one to showcase
You should try Rebecca zamolo zamfam hot chocolate
The hair product you used did shine your hair😊
The white line needs to go above your crease, you did an amazing job on shadow
HopeScope do milk with hot chocolate because with water what??? 🥛
Wait,WATER WITH HOT CHOCOLATE????!!!!!?!
Hey could u try doing a video where you buy the worst rated things on temu or Amazon?
11:30 you should deffinetly try to ad lemon juice to the blue tea. If it is real butterfly pea flower, something magic vil happen ✨️ 💖
Hello
Hello hope ☺️
Hope my darling ... where is your kettle??? As a British fan, watching you pour hot water from a pan to a mug using a ladle made me cringe!!! Please be a spokeswoman for USA tea drinkers and please get a kettle, no idea why people in America never use a kettle to boil water, much easier lov xxx P.S love your content xxx
If you from YouTube you can't like this comment
I love how honest you are with the product.. most influencers say the worst things are so amazing! You’re the best hopescope!🩷🩷🧋
HEY Hope I relly love you'r vidios !
My birthday is in 2 day's 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
HOPE you could do the most expensive youtuber products in the video....🥺🥺🥺
Being a diabetic liveing on low income the cookies are to high same with the sour candy but l9w surger stuff is always higer
I love HopeScope
j thought james charles sold the thin brushes for liner etc as he showed himself using them
I HATED the new beastables. Horrible flavor. I had one but and tossed it   Kind of sad you supported some of these people by buying their products.
Why is James Charles still making makeup products? He should be in jail for what he did to those boys (also, makeup has came in paint tubes before! Some brands have came up with the idea before him)
These are like my favourite videos when I saw this I nearly cried and no one does it like hopescope❤
the problem with most of these is it's existing stuff put in packaging and sold at stupidly high prices. like Pokimane's cookies that you can get from costco without her name for 2/3rds cheaper.
Yes girl
You were a champ to try some of these products..  I hope your stomach was not upset later after the video😊😊
I would just easy the mini cookies like a bowl of cereal, you could get a couple bowls out of one little pack 😂
Streaming on my tv but got on my laptop just to comment and tell you how freaking beautiful you look at the end of this video 😩😭❤❤❤ I LOVE this hair color on you.
Hope: *pulls out sponge* Leo: *sniffffff* is it for me??
Poor faze rug 1 star review 😮
the predator paints? 🫢
you should by a bunch of Australian snack s because us Aussies have the best snacks and if u do vegemite  wrong we will find you
Anything with sugar subs can upset the stomach.  A lot of sugar free gum gives me gas. I think it's xylotol that does it.
I used Brad's super gloss before and it worked great in my hair. I saw the reviews and took a leap of faith. I truly liked it but it's too expensive for me to buy very often and I have a lot of hair so I use a lot of it in one go.
I have to know where your dress is from!! Please, it’s so cute
Video Idea-trying Snacks from around the world
Omg Leo looked ready to eat those candies at the beginning 😅😂
I’m giving you a thumbs down bc you’ve give James Charles a platform. Gross.
Me fasting watching this 😋
Do butterflies pee? 🇦🇺❤️
A huge YouTuber I admire supporting James Charles in 2024? And I quote , "I Had Hope. Anyway, You Ended Up Disappointing Me More Than Any Of The Other Silly Girls.” --Miranda Priestly.
⬇️ if you love hope
Thank you Hope for doing this video
Uuhmm they wayy mouth dropped when i saw the promo for hopes seamless set 🤤
Very shocked that brad mondo is on it 😢
Idk I kind of disappointed in her videos now cause it's all TikTok stuff nd like it's so repetitive and I miss old hopescope
12:05 Didnt influencers learn their lesson about supporting predators with the Glamzilla drama. very disappointed
My co-worker that loved Mondo ordered his set of semi dyes or whatever it was and gave me green ones since i have green hair...THE WOOOORST product i have ever used. I wanted use it as colour refresh, but there was zero colour pay of (i tried one on bleached hair cuz i didnt want to waste it but still nope), you had to use tones of it, because of formula...it is literally in comparison to the oldest toner brand i know that cost 1/4th of the price... it was not doing anything good to my hair like it claimed. She hated it too. His products are not good at all. It's not just the gloss... I'm not even joking i unsubbed him after that. xD I don't like lies...  About the chocolate...as an European that moved to USA....i hate every single chocolate here. And mr beast is not an exception. It's awful...but better than hershey.
No way faze rug
5:34  expectations v/s reality
It probably has Sorbitol as a sugar replacement which causes upset gut and diarrhea. There are two others that cause the same problem one starts with a Z and the other starts with an X I just can't remember the names. You are brave to try all of those items.
What hope is a painter 14:30
I must be out of the loop because I don't even know who some of these influencers are.
i am very disappointed in you supporting James. you have a big following of kids and families and you putting a man who has admitted to his behavior in a positive light will only make them go and support him. as a victim of SA myself you are giving those kids to him. he didn't care about what he did then and blamed victims and tried to pay them off to silence them. I loved your content but there is no way you didn't know about what he did.
Most sugar free products make you gassy or need to go lol so honestly good if your constipated 🤣
I have yoga pants where they criss cross in the front and I think that's the fault with them. They always roll down slightly and you got to constantly pull them up lol
Girl thanks for the honesty!!!plus you were not hating on the product just giving constructive feedback
Im reading the ingredients & "corn fiber" is the first one listed & allulose is second.
I think you should try the super gloss again but on clean clarified hair.
Why do you endorse predators???
i love how its called chamberlain coffee and its tea
OMG hope I love when you do these videos!!
It’s the Malitol and Sorbitol that they add as sugar substitutes in most of these “better for you candies”. Why don’t they add natural sweeteners like Agave? I mean, the Agave flavor is subtle and can be masked with another flavor of your choice. That way you could consume more without stomach upset. Plus, it’t actually better for you!
As someone who was almost groomed.... I am very uncomfortable with you buying or using anything thats from or has to do with James charles   Normally I love your content but i can't thumbs up this one due to what i stated above.. its worse that you gave 5 stars and have a link for him/his stuff
Me randomly eat a fun dip and then she mentioned that’s what the drink tastes like..idk just the odds
For those who love hopescope are now my friends 😊 Like to claim 👇🏼
Hopescope is so brave when showing her undies 😂
How does Leo stay so calm with the hairdryer, every dog I have had has los there mind over the hairdryer
I will do 10 push-ups for every like this comment gets
I actually really like the strawberry matcha tea from Chamberlain   ❤
ITS HOT CHOCOLATE U ADD MILK NOT HOT WATER AND THE SAME FOR ALL THOSE WHO SAY OAT MILK BECAUSE U ADD OAT MILK!!!
Always start from the ends of your hair to put your serem on making sure hope keep up with your great videos ❤❤❤❤
These are my fav vids I love it And hi hope!❤
hi hope.      i love your videos
He just needs to rebrand them as Fart Tarts — for those with a “backup” issue.
Pls review pink friday nails by nicki minaj
NOOOOOO HOPPEEEE!!!!!! Any sugar free candy will make you poop your pants. this is what happened with the haribo sugar free gummie bears!
Can you try out kaladé by Kat klark
Ppl who know who hang out with shyah is allowed to like
Pls review pink friday nails by nicki minaj
i used the xmondo hair gloss and my hair felt super soft but yeah it wasn’t very shiny or anything afterwards. i never had problems with my hair being greasy or weighed down though so i think the reviewers didn’t fully rinse it out. i will say, the instructions say “apply to clean, dry hair” so you’re supposed to wash and dry your hair and then apply it, leave it on for 20 minutes, and rinse. that’s why it doesn’t say to wash and condition, because you’d be stripping your hair of the natural oils if you did it again
So funny 😂❤
Leo smelling everything ❤😂😂
Also, when someone asked her about the price Pokimane called him a “broke boy.” Shes an awful person
Pokimane cookies are a rip off. She tried selling them aa “healthy snacks” because they have vitamins d in them. Youd have to eat seven of them to get you daily dose when you can just take one pill. Shes a scammer
Hope please review more stuff from bloglattes  pleSeeeee 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
You slayed the straight hair 💅💅💅💅💅
pls do not support james charles
I feel like the Joyride people ate the entire package and that’s why they diarrhea’d
Let’s not buy or support predators like Jamz Charz please
All sugar free candy does that though. It's not specific to this brand or this youtubers product.
This is why I never really support influencers businesses since they aren't actually passionate about it! Some are but others just slap their name and make it super expensive!! For sure Cassie from Blogiloties?! She actually goes through reviews and makes videos based on her work!
I hate one of these YouTubers try and guess in the comments I will reply to who get it right
I love all your videos every time but next time let's not support or feature James Charles...
yeah skipping the jc section lets not support predators...
I loved this video SO much!!
2:24 bc there aren’t even that many reviews lol
Wait Hope is a painter?
DONT BELIEVE SHE ATE ANY OF THE CANDIE. IT CUT OFF AFTER EVERY SUPPOSED BITE!!!!!! CHECK CLOSELY
Anyone else miss Hope's pink hair? She's gorgeous but I do miss the pink hair.
11:50 hiiiiiiii      Ssssiisstersssssss
Now I want a MrBeast bar
Everyone I've seen use Nimya loves it.
Grossed out by gluten free cookies?? That’s all I can eat😭
Noooo hope James is a really bad person don’t buy from him or do commissions :(
I really love u hope, but giving JC a platform and spending money on his brand didn't work for me, after all of the accusations that keep coming out about him.
Noooo why are you affiliated with James Charles 😢
Can you make a video trying Filipino Foods
Girl did Ryan trahan dirty…
Could you do a video on 1989 or you fav show
Jeffree Star won't even buy Peto paint from James Charles
Maybe the hot chocolate would’ve tasted better with milk not water
Hope you don’t have to worry people don’t care about if you’re good or not I think your make up skills are way better than I can do😅 and that’s being generous❤
including james charles tho? why
OK I just can’t with this how is it possible that the smallest blush that she got was more money than the big eyeshadow palette that she got😊
Your dog is so sweet !! but  I can tell you most sugar free candies or chocolates warn you about a laxative effect if you consume too much and yes some people are sensitive to the artificial sugar its Malilot not good I avoid sugar free chocolate and ice creams for that reason. If they used Stevia whole other ball game
You will read this wrong….. “those who come didn’t from are TikTok allowed like to comment this..” btw credits to @ItzRileyShorts for the comment. It was the comment I randomly chose okay!?😭✋✋
Low sugar and sugar free candies usually cause stomach issues if you're not used to eating them
You should try to do a rating youtubers candy
I love Emma's coffee, but I bought the hot chocolate, drank two sips, and threw it away. My roommate disliked it as much as I did, and we LOVE Hot coco.
if u like the mini beauty blender u should check out pink river, it’s a beauty blender company here in the uk and they do tiny beauty blenders to massive ones and they are the softest things to exsist !!
She needs to read the reviews for sugar free gummy bears. Those sour strips probably use the same stuff.
Leo is so cute 🥰
Not the James Charles "predator paints!" 🤮
the blue matcha chamberlin tea reminds me of sol de Janeiro 59 scent for some reason 😭😭😭
You definitely have to watch the amount you eat when you are having sugar free candy
Mr Beast chocolate is actually really good. My 10 year old would beg my husband to buy for him and knowing I love chocolates, my husband bought for me as well. 😅
Seriously the dog in every single shot is really distracting and annoying
hope!! you should do more lululemon videos! I personally really loved them and they helped me know what to buy and if they’re products are worth it!! love you and your channel ❤
2:11 my deadname and the correct spelling i thought i was being soul read
Can we stop with the comment fishing for likes…
Guarteened those Trisha reviews from Painted are from Mrs.Paytas 😂🫢 kidding but maybe LOL
the chamberlain coffe looks like mold lol
JOYRIDE IS A 100 STARS
I can't believe how much people charge for little bits of stuff ... $20 for tea?  $28 for cookies?  No thanks ....
I love Brad mondo. I think you need to use the hair gloss more than just once to see results 😉  @hopescope
I tried the Mr. beast chocolate and it was not good. I think Hershey’s is even better, and that’s not saying much. WAY overpriced for what it is.
Ryan’s candy sound like the forbidden gummy bears from Amazon if you know you know. If not google it and read the reviews 😂😂😂
James Charles? Really and you add affiliate to get money from it your fans are clearly disappointed in you your fans are hoping you are not a p-word protester
I really wish James Charles was not a part of this video because it giving him a platform he does not deserve at least for the victims sake. 12:13
Something fun is that Ryan puts his gf and his name on the package
Cause u love nails design and false nails you could make your own nails at home for a few minutes and it’s called poly gel
You could have done the whole video without having to support promote and give kind words and positive review to a child predator. I understand wanting to stay above The fray but at some point you're just a coward Hope.
Sugar free candy will make you gassy and go BOOM
As a diabetic, I can confirm that many low/sugar free candy causes stomach issues. I found this out the hard way 💨 💩
13:21 does anyone know the song that plays right here
Hopescope do you remember me from the live
Kerastase will make your hair shiny ✨️
face rugs product looks like the one chip challenge (taylor’s version)
p.o.v. Leo (sniff sniff)
The BOOM part killed me 😂
Butterfly tea—with sweet pea flowers is a blue violet and to die for AAANNNNDDDDD cheaper
Butterfly tea—with sweet pea flowers is a blue violet and to die for AAANNNNDDDDD cheaper
Where is that white belted dress from !?
Umm, why did you ladle out water from a saucepan - dont you have a kettle?
The diarrhea reviews are true of any sugar free gummy candies
Anyone who does hot chocolate with water deserves jail time.
About Joyride, there was an older company before Ryan's version of Joyride, the original Joyride was not selling so Ryan decided to buy it, change the formula, and sell it under his name instead. I'm pretty sure those on star reviews are about the older version and not the new one.
Why would you include James Charles products in this video? There is no way you do not know about the controversies and criminality that surround him, yet you have still decided to consciously use your huge platform to continue to promote and platform a predator.
Love The Video And You Hope!💜
they were sugar free ones, these 80% less   should be ok :P
Hello hope!!! I love your content so much and I really want you to try out the new Florence by mills pajama line!! Love your content so much❤❤
If you want a good sour candy, I HIGHLY recommend SOUR BOYS candy by ytuber oompaville! These are delicious and SUPER sour, I actually burnt the inside my mouth with only eating 2 bags of these, my tongue hurt but it was so good and so worth it!
34 yr old here - I’ve never had gas or cramps or bloat from eating candy…. What is in it that makes it so different?!
why affiliate for james charles’ brand, queen hope?😢
Not the James Charles predator paints 😅
Interesting way to make tea……using a ladle…..must try 😂
11:49 is when J Charles appears. Skip to 14:41 if you don't want to see that.
james charles? Really?
Time stamps  0:16 Ryan trahan 2:15 blogilates 3:58 NikkieTutorials 6:19 pokimane 8:06 brad mondo 9:56 Emma Chamberlain 11:49 James Charles 14:40 Mrbeast 15:40 FaZe Rug   Now u can find ur favorite youtuber!
love your videos but including james charles in this video considering all the things he’s done was a big miss for me, although you’re reviewing his product you’re still using his face in the thumbnail and low key praising him AND linking his products for people to easily buy therefore giving a groomer a platform :/
Try some Sour boys candy by Oompaville...much better than the ones that were supposed to make you go boom 😂😂😂
I know that we are NOT supporting James Charles in 2024 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Quit supporting a predator. James Charles is an admitted predator.
I actually like Joyride. I didn't realize it had anything to do with someone famous. They're kinda expensive but totally worth it.
“ now open for Birthday party face paintings “ killed me for than it should have😭
Tried mondo hair color to freshen up my burgundy and it did not color my hair at all was highly disappointed as he hypes it up a lot
Can you try other YouTuber merch
😂 you are my idol I want to be just like you when I get older
I love your vids! ❤️
Hope is my fav YouTuber please like hope❤😢
I can confirm the new feastables are SO GOOD ❤️
Mrbeast chocolate is better than hersheys in my opinion, I tried it and it’s sooo good
I love the white dress, it’s so cute!!!
Fun. I enjoyed hearing about these brands. Thanks hope x
Ok but with the Myna cookies not all the hate is bc of the cookies themselves. A lot of it has to do with Poki's response to fans who couldn't afford her $28 cookies. It was quite rude and kinda classist. Oh and the fact that they're incredibly similar to a different brand's (don't remember if it was creator backed) cookies that came out before hers and don't cost nearly as much.
Your hair was 10000x shinier BEFORE you put crap in it
Please try night sweet thing!
A lot of the candy with less sugar has a lot more FIBER. If a person isn't use to getting a lot of fiber they can go BOOM.
I love u hopescope you are an amazing person
I love feastabells
nail art brushes are really good as a liner brush
Is your dollhouse done?
Under 1 day gang 👇
Ummmm buying James Charles makes me question subscribing to your channel.
I'm actually a 69 year old man
did she really add water in hot chocolate 😭
Great video! I really hope to buy one of your bracelets!! They sold out so quickly!
Ryan’s candy probably gave so many people gas, bloating, and diarrhea because if you read the label, 4 strips has 8g of fibre (which is already 29% of daily value) and most people probably ate the whole bag in one sitting thinking it was ok to do so because its “healthier”. The first ingredient is literally corn fibre. Agar which is also in there can also upset the stomach causing diarrhea and stomach pain
Too faced pallets used to give little mini booklets with their pallets for ideas with step by steps idk if they still do I haven’t needed new eyeshadow in forever. And then I had a everyday pallets cheap from cvs and it had a sticker on the back with step by step ideas
4:56 the two faced born this way does😊
I tried Brad mondo hair color and it’s the best semi permanent color I have ever tried I use nothing else now
I love hope’s videos! I want more 😂❤
The best thing I've ever found to make your hair shiny & healthy is chi silk infusion serum!! I've been using it for years it saved my hair after bleach. Works wonders !!
I love Hope's content but the support, affiliate links and in general giving a self admitted predator a platform is not it. 🤨
Allulose sugar alternative is supposed to be the newest safest sugar alternative
Alluose is used as a laxative in the medical field and is used as a suger free option so if consumed in large amounts it can cause diarrhea
Painted is not the actual problem, it’s the creator
She gave the groomer 5 stars 😭 Hope, noooooooo
honestly your just so beautiful and when i saw your straight hair i absolutly was stunned🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰😁
Nimya from @nikkietuttorials is really good
I wish you didn’t even give James Charles more press
She’s a content creator who is in the line of work of trying products that belong to people we don’t care for but please remember this is her job , I don’t personally take any offense to her trying products from people I don’t care for it’s her job guys be gentle Hope deserves the most respect she is not like other influencers at all love her ❤
Yikes Hope James Charles ?
So disappointed you bought James Charles products.
I love how Leo always steals the show. Hope I think you have a new competitor lol 😂
you should definitely try p.louise. The makeup is amazing. James charles basically ripped off their colour bases with his painted collection in my opinion. You would loveeee their packaging💖
I love your dress! from where did you get it?
How did she get joyride if it’s sold out?
When you were reading reviews for the Pokimane cookies, I had to listen again because I genuinely thought you said “these taste like ash tray, not food” and now I can’t un-hear it! 😂
I would give this video 10/10, but James Charles… Its a 3/10 for me.
We all be watching this at the same time 😂💀
This video was amazing
Maltitol
The fact people don’t know that fiber causes upset stomachs if you aren’t used to it is wild to me lol
Love u so much Hope!
Leo is so cute
Sorry, but the dog is super distracting.  And don't you think that Nikki makeup look was photoshopped?  NOBODY can put makeup on that perfectly.  And I love your hair straight!!!  How pretty!!
Hi Hope, you are so pretty!❤
Not the james charles😢
Any thing with artificial sweetner with cause the flatulence and diarrhea.
i luvv how u smell everything
Did Leo get a haircut, he looks so adorable
I would LOVE to see you do a video on nothing but Brad Mondo’s products!
I can see the shine but not thet deep
Technically, Nikki Tutorials has had a pallete before as a collab with Too Faced.
NOOOOOOOO!! You missed the best part of the Blue Macha drink... if it's made with BUTTERFLY PEA... add a spoonful of lemon juice and watch it change to bright pink instantly... it's the best part  and adds to the earthy flavour - not kidding, TRY IT 💜
I can’t eat Oreo cause I am allergic but I can eat myna of pokimane.
Am I the only one disappointed she supported James Charles? I’m a firm believer people make mistakes but if they refuse to own them, blame victims and continue the same act they don’t deserve support until they have legit changed and owned the mistake.
2 dollars a tea? I can get high-quality tea for 2 euro that has about 24 servings! Who even buys that influencer nonsense?
it’s time to stop gate keeping if you want shiny hair try the natura bissé conditioner i didn’t love the shampoo but the conditioner is great
Not hope adding water to the coca powder and saying it’s not good…
I think the chocolat pawder is for milk
Glossier's Cloud Paints come in paint tubes :) they've been around since 2017!
you make everything interesting and fun, i'm finished watching all your vids
@ItzRileyShorts STOP disrespecting Hope’s channel. You’ve only ever commented on two of Hope’s videos with this ridiculous comment. Hope is inclusive and welcomes everyone. Stop trying to promote your channel, while creating exclusions on Hope’s channel. We love Hope, regardless of how we found her and her awesome channels and content!
...and boom goes the dynamite 🎉
I loved the reviews but why must we buy and support james THE PREDATOR charles brand painted??
I have to say im proud of you to lift up others on  YouTube trying to make products.  You gave your honest review and i love that!!! ❤️ more people need to spread positivity thank uou for the great video im happy to be a new subscriber
The issue with Pokimane's cookies is they are the same as Midnight Mini cookies for $9.99 that they used to sell at costco.  Same company makes both.  Total scam.  Just rebranded and tripled the price.
I love popflex, but I definitely don’t wear it to workout 😂. Honestly my favorite loungewear
Boycott oreo !
“ I did not go BOOM😢”
The make up had me dying, especially when she looked at at the packages
The Emma Chamberlain lattes in a can are absolutely disgusting. Like grooooosssss. Is this how Californians like it?
NOT DA GROOMER😭😭
I’ve never been a fan of “healthy” alternatives for “unhealthy” foods. I would rather eat an actual candy and accept that it’s not the healthiest instead of eating a replacement that probably wouldn’t taste as good and might have questionable ingredients
Girl, James Charles’ stuff is getting one star reviews because of him, not because of the products. The anti-JC hate train is gonna come after you now for promoting his stuff now too.  I’d change your thumbnail and cut that segment if you want to stay off the radar of the drama channels…
your a painter?
You should review Sour Boys by Oompaville. I'm not a big fan of sour candy, but you are. Naturally colored & sweetened, from what I understand. Thanks for reviewing the rest of these 😊
me looking at the xmondo reviews after i bought 50 of them: 👁👄👁
I love how hope gives her honest opinion ❤❤❤❤
i honestly did not expect blogilates in this video 😅😅
Not James Charles 😭
my family tried 1upcandy thanks to your video!
Please don’t give James more money
I recently saw Mr. Beast's chocolate bars in a store here in Sweden. $9 for a tiny chocolate bar. It was under 100 gram (3,5oz), I think it was like 60 gram ( about 2oz I think) or something. Is the chocolate made of gold?
You should try IPSY glam bag and or box. They are only a $14/month subscription and they'll send you makeup/skin car/ hair care products.
Mr beast chocolate is disgusting. I just did a survey comparing Hershey's chocolate to his chocolate and Hershey's came up on top because his is dry and bitter and just not good.
Oompavilles candy? “Sour boys” I heard it was good!
When are you planning on restocking the friendship bracelets? I wanted one so bad last time but was a little late to the party so I’ve been checking your store every day since to see if you’ve restocked them. 😊❤
what type of dog is leo? I just lost my dog, but Leo kinda have the same face my dog had
You should try clothes from temu
You do a video about Rebecca Zamolo’s merch
I appreciate the “I did not go BOOM” update 😂👍🏻
Nooo Why support James Charles 😫 (lest we forget he admitted to multiple inappropriate instances with underage fans)
I really love how she expresses her honest opinion about the products so respectfully.
Love your videos ❤
Mr Beast chocolate sux. 🍫  I'm in Central Canada and that chocolate is way over priced here at $10+ Canadian dollars.  Bought it once for my son but will never again buy it. Wasn't even good. If I wanna spend premium money on chocolate I'd or rather buy Lindt chocolate or the very least Casbury chocolate 🍫
Those sours probably have an artificial sweetener, some cause digestive issues if eaten in excess and 3 be excessive can
Hope now supports a known child predator? Sad
let’s watch nen fam steal this one…
Poor choice to include JC paints. We all know what he admitted and what he’s like. He shouldn’t be supported as he really hasn’t learned. I hope Hope makes better choices next time. You can’t say she didn’t know about his problematic history.
Your dog is sooooooooooooo cute ❤❤❤
Love you and your content Hope but really feel like it's unethical to buy from and bring attention to James Charles  Edit: just noticed you also have an affiliate link for his product. Really disappointing.
you have beautiful eyes especially at 17:12
0:08
🎉
For shining hair you can use shining spray.
I think the reason why there wasn't much reviews for Nikki is that initially she couldn't ship worldwide and she started on her own and that's expensive. We couldn't get our hands on her products in the beginning. She's based in Europe too. Might explain the weird language review (lol) I guess Nikki is working on her shipping and expanding since you got them. I personally want her products so much rn.
Hope you ate that eyeshadow!!
i feel like the joyride one is kinda unfair because you technically didn’t read the reviews of what you were trying
This makes me so sad but I think I might have to unsubscribe. As someone that’s been groomed and SA’d quite literally throughout my whole childhood, I don’t want to support someone that praises and supports a predator like James Charles. Honestly super disappointed.
you shouldn't be worried about the james charles painted being "practical", they don't meet fda regulations and contain harmful chemicals that aren't approved for use on the eyes, mainly the red. you should throw them away. disappointed you supported james at all.
She put water in hot chocolate powder 😂😂
Unbelievably disappointed that you reviewed and gave a predator a positive review. Do better and care about victims.
It's always a good day when we get a new upload from Hope!!! I love Hope!!!!
hahahahh i love these videos sooo much!! can you do five star now? ❤
i love it
Hi hope! Can you PLEASE do another testing viral diy hacks
JC is a predator
5:03 You look like the mom from young Sheldon😭
BOOM!
Hope, please tell us that you've just somehow missed the James Charles saga and aren't knowingly supporting him. We'll be crushed. 😢
I've tried the Mr beast bar and its so good 👍
Yay
love your videos hopee
It would be an actual honour to have a comment ❤ed by hope I would die love you hope❤
Slay is all I have to say lol
I’m so glad I found your channel, love so much your videos, your energy and your transparency but please, no more James Charles 🥶
love your videos!! you are amazing!🩷☺️
Okay but at the end your hair does look really shiny
Never give your dog artificial sugar, dangerous for dogs
I want a collab with Brad to do your hair
Great video hope I love your content keep up the great work love it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Allulose also doesn't spike blood sugar and has recently been found to lower o er blood sugar.
Let’s stop giving child groomers named James Charles the light of day on any platform please!  Ofc you are great, Hope, and love the channel. ❤
The gassy sour strips were probably due to eating too much of the candy in one setting. There’s an infamous review for sugar free gummy bears where someone pooped their pants after eating an entire 5lb bag. Most artificial sweeteners are fine in normal amounts so I think a lot of these reviews were people who ate multiple bags at once.
What kind of hair products do you use? Your hair is so beautiful ❤
sorry but I think your eyemakeup look is soo funny :D
❤❤❤❤
OK so I was diagnosed with diabetes a month ago and I have learned to read the package on sugar-free candy it does tell you that it can cause stomach issues and it most certainly does. You should only eat two and that’s it.
Is i just me or does she just have the most pretty Hair in the Hole World. People who agree 👇🏼❤️
If you add a little bit of acid to your blue tea, like a few drops of lemon juice, it should turn purple (that's the butterfly pea tea reacting). It's really a cool effect, specially in your transparent cups!
I wouldn't buy Painted due to it being James Charles' brand. I'm not into supporting predators
It was nice to see some of the products being better than the reviews
That first candy must be made with the same sugar substitute as the infamous Haribo Sugar Free gummy bears. 😂
Hi ❤❤❤  I love your channel so much❤
Josmarlis
My partner tried the OG mr beast bars and he didnt like them, he said they were just ok and really expensive 😂
Nah.  Giving James Charles any air time is not a good look.  I really enjoy your content, but I'm so tired of seeing you promote terrible people like the Kardashians and now...a predator, too.   smh   So disappointing!
Hi hope I don't know if you like pickles but if you do you should try a chamoy pickle lol sorry 😮
I think a lot of reviews about "healthier" products are not judged fairly. Many people see a product with better-for-you ingredients and expect it to still taste the same or very similar to the unhealthy version.  And then the whole no/low sugar thing... People don't look at ingredients/the nutrition facts.  Usually these products include erythritol or high amounts of fiber, which are very commonly known to cause GI issues.  The first ingredient of Joyride is soluble corn fiber and there are 8g of fiber per serving.  Allulose is the next ingredient and can also cause GI issues.  Some people are more sensitive to these ingredients too, so someone could eat only 3 pieces of this candy and have massive GI symptoms, whereas someone like me could eat half the bag and would be fine other than a mild stomachache.
There is NO WAY Hope hasn't seen all these comments that are extremely disappointed in her reviewing the groomer pedo's brand and talking pretty highly about it. She should take down and edit that part out or at least say why she chose to even let that gross waste of space be apart of her reviews. Smh 😔😔
You have to try Kikiz Cosmeticz! She makes the cutest lip glosses with fun themes and scents and stuff. I dont use lipgloss from any other brand now, and own over 50 glosses from her❤
soooo much hatew from pepoel
Girl i already have IBS, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and a hiatal hernia. I dont need any pooping candy😂 my GI tract is fuuuuuck3d already 😂
Just saying I’m sure James Charles’s new make up palette is great. But that’s not why it got 1 star. It’s because of his history even if people won’t say it on the reviews. He has tried so hard to get people to forget and forgive him to be relevant again but no one will.
HOPE !   LOVED your mexico vacation vlog and i just wanted to tell you it looked like SO MUCH FUN!!!  Im so happy for you and Tyler to  be able to experience Mexico together!! Would be great to get a vacation vlog every now and again lol the way you had it planned out while comparing the destinations to Pintrest was so unique!!  So yeah do it again sometime and thx so much for sharing your lovely getaway with us!!!💜🩶💙💜🩶💙💜🩶💙
Not a fan of promoting James Charles
I love Ryan but I feel like oompa has the sour candy game down better
Love love you video and Leo smelling everything 😂🐕🐶
1000 coment
OMG hope you hair looks so cute straight!
I know you won’t see this but Im pretty sure most of the diarrhea comments on joy ride are jokes because of Ryan’s crazy 1 star review thing.
Blue drinks… Percy Jackson fans, ASSEMBLE 👇
I enjoy Nimya. Her primer works great on my skin. One of the best I have ever used.  I've never tried the food products.
Try adding lemon to the matcha it should turn purple
First video of yours that I've ever disliked, supporting JC and his brand as well as promoting them with a shoppable link is just sad, and the products are not unique at all there are many makeup brands that have come out with these products.
Pokiemane or however you spell her name, she is also in trouble with copying everything in her cookies to another well known brand.
But then again people just hate James Charles for no reason
My guess is she did that white line with a graphic liner/pen, so it had a sharp tip and wouldn’t drip funny!
Omg ! Hope, I work at a company that specializes in friendship bracelets.  We host birthday parties, adult events, and even teach after school classes. It's so fun! I wish I could help you with all those friendship bracelets 😂
I love your dress in this video Hope, where is it from!!
Nikki Tutorials can never do wrong imo.
those who love hope 👇
I love my Emma Chamberlain, hot chocolate, and the blue Matcha so give me these people are not making it correctly I don’t understand the hate towards those products because I would definitely purchase mine again. Also, when I make my hot chocolate, I don’t make it with water. I make it with the milk, oat milk, Chobani, oat milk. I don’t know if that makes a difference to me best hot chocolate I’ve ever had and the blue Matcha I make it as a latte, so I don’t know, but everybody has their own taste so
Hope reviewing active wear was no on my 2024,bingo card
You look so beautiful with a straight hair omg I love it ❤️
I’m honestly a bit surprised by a couple of the people featured in this video considering their problems in the past. But that’s just my take on it, otherwise the video was good.
The ice cream stuffy in the back spying on hope 😂
Hey I don't know if you will see this but um.. I was just wondering if you could do a morning routine video next please!!!!!!!
Hope instead of putting that soap tip: use hair gloss
I remember during a live you asked about nails and I see you're wearing the ones I thought would be great for St. Patrick's Day.
You should do mini verse foodies in a satisfying video
Please don’t support James Charles 😔
slowly catching up and keeping up
I always love your content, so I'll just skip to after you review James Charles products, as a mom I just can't support him...
I wonder if the sour candies have sugar alcohols in them.. that often gives people tummy problems (including myself 😅)  With the blue drink (butterfly pea flower) add lemon/lemonade and it turns purple 😊 (& tastes delicious)
I just love your honest reviews , and your videos 😻
Leo wanted to do his makeup at 4:32!😂
The reviews for the sour candy remind me of the Amazon review for Haribo sugar free gummy bears that went viral. The lesson being that sugar free or low sugar candy can cause some nasty stomach problems.
I realllly love your hair like this!
She’s so kind and uplifting ✨
HOPE IM ON THE FLOOR WITH THIS COMMENT 😂 1:36
PLEASE TRY KENDALS (I think) GUMMIES ❤  please
OMG hope you should do a review on the skincare products that everybody’s obsessed with nowadays like the bubble, drunk, elephant, etc and if you do it, please shout me out in the next video if you do it
You should do the exact same challenge expect 5 star products instead of 1 star products!
Love the dog!
BOOM sooooo funny hahaha 😂
If you add lemon to butterfly pea tea it turns purple
Plsssssss try nick sturniolos space camp lip balm in a vid 🙏❤
I was so mad with xmondo the super blue didn't eve deposit colour on my BLEACHED hair it was mental I was so mad for 35$ a tub
I have been waiting all day for the queen to post !! So happy
I'm sure a lot of these are true, but I wonder how many people leave bad reviews just because they hate the YouTuber. I'd have a hard time trusting any of these reviews, good or bad.   (Low sugar products are known to cause GI distress in some people, so I believe those.)
this is crazy but WHAT was that vamping church camp music underneath the James Charles Painted section 😂
C'mon now Hope, why are you buying James Charles' stuff?
James is meh. He’s not really the best to support I don’t blame people for rating his brand so low since he’s not very liked
No for James Charles. Do you even know about his allegations?
The problem people had with the pokimane cookies wasn't even just the price. She called people poor for not being able to afford them.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
About the Pokimane cookies, I'm pretty sure the main reason people were upset is because all she did was slap her name on some cookies you can get from Costco and majorly bumped up the price 💀
the reason why the sour candies probably made so many people have stomach is because theres a sugar subsditute that literally works like a laxative LOL
That one astronaut food review is too creative 😂
a good hair oil that I use is the moroccanoil 🥰
I love how you did Ryan I live his videos!!☺️💗🎀
I ❤ mr.beast’s new updated chocolate. I literally have some in my purse.
That candy has a lot of fiber, ur def going to get gas n poop
not loving the support of james charles :/ don’t agree with supporting someone who has openly admitted to being a predator
Lol i bought a mr beast bar yesterday for £9
I got 2 liquid "paint" type eyeshadows and the ONLY way we could get it off was with a makeup eraser rags. I had put some on me & liked it & put on my daughter and she didn't like it. I tried baby wipes, makeup wipes, face wash and soap. It was so bad for her. I had to wait until we got home from our trip to get it off both of us. I don't remember the brand, but it came from Ulta over a year or so ago.
Really disappointed to see the predator paints in this video 😪
Loved how you ended the video on a great positive note like always!
I am the 900th comment lol  Oh and HIIII HOPE😊
for the mondo try to let ur hair air dry next time
Someone has said there is a recording device in the mrbeast PR box
Hi hope
When she brushed her wet hair!!! Ahh hope I love you but that is so damaging!!
Heyy lol i luv ur vids u guys slay hope and the rest of the youtubers
Heyy lol i luv ur vids u slay hope
I love your hair straight
Hope!!! I've been wondering what you do for workouts
Did you say you were a painter 😮 I never knew that 😂 I luv your vids and Leo is such a cutie 🥰🤪🩷
Oreos are gluten free too
How are you reviewing accurately if you are affiliated with 3 of the products you rated 🙄
Love the Beast trunk full of chocolate!
Look I don't know what you're doing but if you literally just like blow drag your hair and it's straight why did you have to take a whole bunch of time just curling it and if you didn't do that that means you took another whole day just to make this video it doesn't really take that long just to make a video
Disappointed you gave money to the groomer James Charles
buy a baby reborn and see how real they are per price point
Ryan Trahan did not have any candy before and if you look at the dates it’s from 2021 2023 dates when he DIDNT have any candy 1:06  is the time too
thank god hope is on this planet i have saved more than 1000$ watching her vids
Hi Hope! I think that Nikki used eyeliner to get those white stripes over the eyeshadow❤
Hope reading all the negative reviews and then is like LETS TRY IT OUT 🙃🙃
❤❤❤
Omg this video was so funny I love your videos hopescope!
who else loevs hope
PLEASE! Make a Vintage Lisa Frank Video
I find it very sad that the makeup community has not supported Nikky enough. Her products are amazing and everything I have used is either solid good or of the best I've ever used. Same with Rodial.
That hair is giving😊
Hope, you should try popular make up and skincare.💗
OMG 3 HRS AGOO!!
Your so nice! Also can you do more 2000s videos and amearican girl doll videos and you should try our genartion doll english verson of amearcan girl doll
Leo is so cute
Please don’t like this comment.
The sour candy that causes gas, is prolly sweetened with sugar alcohols lol a lot of people can’t digest sugar alcohols lol never seen em before but by the description’s that’s what it sounds like lol
Please make some more bracelets I’ve been wanting for one
Just want to say. On the update at the end your hair looked really shiny 😍 👍🏻
Love your vids!
1 like=1 push up
The fact that you heart sooooo many of your comments is heart warming
First day crew🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
I always forget Hope is also a painter, and im always shocked at how amazing she is at it💛
You're too nice to give 1 star.
Those who came because that got a notification⬇️
Why are we still supporting James Charles ? Disappointing.
Do you have a video reviewing those diamond makeup brushed u used your makeup for xx?
Hi
honestly none of these (most of them) are not 1 star products, every product has good and bad reviews
Was painted sponsored in this video ??? Cause it was coming on the view product.....???i don't know I might be wrong
Under 4 hours
I love you in dresses 😍🥰
HOPE YOU ROCK THE STRAIGHT HAIR!!!
“If you like to fart your brains out” 😂😂😂
Do a video where you try making skincare recipes like on Pinterest you could do sugar scrubs lip scrubs lip balms
i was looking at leo all the time🤍🤍😂😂
Don't you dare diss James Charles Trisha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg! U look so gorgeous! 👇👇 if u agree!
Does anyone else think it's kinda cute the  way she says leggings
cute nails hope🫶🏼😍
The old formula for the choc WAS AMAZING. People just didnt like it cuz they r so used to overly sweet choc. I love dark choc n those were the only milk choc bars i could tolerate.
wow Hope your hair looks shiny actually
Sugar free stuff usually makes you have tummy issues! 😅
How can we get your friendship bracelets?
You should do sour boys gg ,by oompaville, he literally created a brand and manufactured everything probably the only youtube product someone made
Hope, question mabey u could do a vid about one-star hair products from famous people? Pls do it (ps can u give me a shoutout if u do?)
I really wish James Charles wasn’t included in this, I don’t think he should still have a platform after everything that happening and him basically admitting to talking to underaged boys.
OMG I've nvr been so early for one of your vids I love u sm😭you're so pretty💗
okay make up is crazy, but I like this palette anyway
Love you hope I wish I could buy your merch was too expensive for me
Disappointed you decided to support James Charles considering the mountain of evidence against him for reaching out to underage boys ....
“I Did Not Go Boom”     HAD ME FALLING OFF MY CHAIR LMAOOOO
If you get the sponge wet it gets so much bigger.
Love you hope 🤍🤍🤍 Keep up the great work!!!!
So I bought the joyride candies as soon as he dropped the promo… Nastiest candy I’ve ever tasted! 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ I was like nooo what is this 🤣
❤😊
I really did not like the first Feastables. They're overpriced in the UK and not a good taste (soz MrBeast!)
I feel like its not even about the products.  People on the internet they just want to hate on everything😭
The fact that shes sacrificing her stomach for us😂 each like gets her good luck for her stomach 👇🏻
I'm shocked you don't have a kettle for the hot water lol ❤
I buy from a little vegan bakery shop as i’m allergic to dairy. It’s £2 per a massive cookie, i can easily spend £25 there and get so much. I can’t believe $28 for those little bags lol. What a rip off 🫣🫣
omg my name is alaina !!!
I did not go boom!! Haha
Hii
Hey! I wanna say something important about why people are hating on the myna cookies! Apparently, there are a knock off of the midnight mini cookies which are like 8-10$ and she's just selling them for more. Also once a fan pointed this out on a live stream and she just replied with "if you're a broke boy just say so!" So yeah 😊.
omg I love this video so much and its super helpful
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please check your lemen8 account
Should check out blowout professor! I use olaplex  oil
I think you should try the jessica kae dresses xx
ngl I like when candy tastes like cleaner..
The problem with pokimane is that she basically shamed her subscribers into buying it basically calling them broke if they can't even afford them or "support" her. Tells you so much about how stuck up she is.
I could have done without the James Charles review.
If you are going to review candy please do sour boys! I want to know because oompaville is amazing
The thing people were upset about the cookies is that they are repackaged unbranded cookies that Pokimane slapped her name on and acted like she did something. I think you can buy them at Costco without her brand name. Then she was condescending to her viewers who can't afford them.
👎👎👎 on this video. Don't support people that don't believe in age of consent!
Pls do Ijustwanttobecool products
Omg! I loooovee your videos specially your cute dog 🐕  Pls like my comment
The hot chocolate with milk is sooo good
Under a day!
A lot of snax, slay💅
Very good video concept, though. It also gives the consumers and the business owners a chance to hear about the products from a different medium, not just ratings, but with detailed reviews.
Hey hope! I don’t know if you already did this in one of your channels but can you go to 1 star restaurants? You don’t have too I just thing it would be entertaining!❤
Hope you have a good day!!!!!
Can't believe you wasted your money on James Charles🤯
an** snacks brand?????
It was written on package mini cookies so why hope shocked to see tinyyyyy like if u agree
Your hair looks very shiny in the update at the end of the video !
I love Mr. Beast chocolate. The crispy bars.
I love when does this!!! ❤❤❤
I love her honest reviews❤ And her honesty ❤
Hope you are so funny and the co host was co hosting today!
To get shiny hair put vinegar on it after you shower
GYATT 3:00
You brighten my day
HAPPY ST PATRICKS DAY UR MY FAV YOUTUBER AND YOU CHANGE MY WORLD BY HOW FUN AND INSPIRING YOU
Under 2 hour gang
as a person who is gluten free most food sucks
At 11:24 she said she didn't like the hot chocolate but maybe try with milk
I love your american girl videos! Definitely please do some reviews of poorly rated restaurants, please & thank you! & also please give lots of love to Leo!
4:31 I would give the product 5 stars just for the beauty blender loll 😂🫶
Under 3 hours team  👇🏼
11:23 For me hot chocolate has always tasted weird with water. Maybe add milk instead of water to the hot chocolate.
Love how she is never lies about these brands😊
Your hair is sooooooooo amazing i love itttttttt
Ryan's candy stuck together for me too! The strawberry flavor looked like beef jerky being stuck together like that haha
GUYS THE QUEEN POSTED❤❤
Ooooh reduced sugar is always a red flag in my books, because it's probably sweetened with something else and it's likely something with a laxative effect. Be super careful around Leo with anything that might contain xylitol! 😊
Can you review OH POLLY please🥺
Any chance you will bring back a version of the simple HOPE sweaters? I loved those soooo much and I could get away with wearing them to school because they had a positive message!
Hi Hope!  Really enjoying your videos, I always look forward to them😊💕 I tried vinegar mixed with water 1:10, and it helped my hair to be shinier, maybe you shoud try it too! Just put the mixture on your hair and dry it. It kinda smells, but after an hour it’s gone😇
I just found this channel recently and I’m so glad I did. I love it
Can you go to a funcy place ever please 😂🎉.l love 💞 you guys
I LOVE your face pain makeup look 🦋
Hopescope I love your videos so much I have been watching you for 3 years  A Video Idea is I Bought the Best TikTok Products Ever❤❤❤❤❤
that was not a true workout outfit. all it was, was a bra and leggings. a true workout outfit with leggings consists of a bra under a knee length shirt that you pair with leggings. you shouldnt be able to see your stomach. that needs to be covered when wearing clothes of any style. you putting that crap all over your face while your dog is in the room is very disrespectful. you should be ashamed for just buying it let alone applying it in front of him.
Lol
hope, love u buddy but you just aren’t qualified to review makeup😳
Can we just all agree all these products that these YouTubers sell is just overpriced
I related so much when she tried the blush 😂 I am always scared of a new blush 😳
If you want shine hair  Lemon and suger and onion juce  with shampoo that work  My hair is so shiny if it work make a vidio on it
U should rate Fazer chocolate bars!
I feel like james charles getting one star reviews has more to do with him as a person. Not the actual product. 😅
i love how leo is sleeping behind her😂
Can you do a review on kids clothes😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤ I love you so much you're my favorite YouTuber❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😅 and maybe one day you should do like buying rubber duckies because I collect them and bedazzled them😊 hope you're having a good day lon is cute
I love Leo. ❤ I love this channel ❤️❤️
Ugh I love Ryan he deserves NO HATE
I wonder with the teas I’m someone who can’t stand the taste of aspartame but lots of people drink things with aspartame no issue. I wonder if there’s a sweetener or flavour in the teas, not necessarily aspartame, that some people are more sensitive to than others, like how some like cilantro in things but to others it’s nasty and ruins it.
A huge reason pokimane got heat for the cookies is because it’s a similar (nearly identical other than one additive), and her servings are about a quarter smaller than the other brand, to which the other brand charges less than half for the same amount of cookies. She then went on live after all the backlash and said “if you’re broke just say that”
Omg this is so funny😂😂😂😂
I love how your 4 legged supervisor is hard at work and keeping you on task! 😆 🤣
the joyride gum is good
Who else is screaming Noooooooo!!! Don't do it!
This kinda reminds me of when people left hilarious reviews on the gummed bears from haribo....hours of laughing joy in the worst way! 😂
Love you I am from Pakistan and I hope you try Pakistani snacks
It's true lollies with natural sugars they do make you go to toilet if you get them all in one go
I love Nikki¡
I think the issue with the painted makeup isn’t the makeup but the owner and so he got bad reviews for other reasons
Hey
How come you brush over on how you did the eyeshadow , don’t u think that your viewers would want to see how it was done , please next time show the steps
Omg I love you hope, am watching from Jamaica 🇯🇲 ❤❤
I love you hope!! 💗💗 always able to make me smile and laugh! You’re so gorgeous!
I kinda feel like your hair does look more shiny after the X mondo gloss
With the red colour from James’ collection DO NOT use the red on your eyes!! They are not safe for around the eyes area.
❤❤❤
Why no kettle? So weird to see Hope ladling hot water in to the cups 😆
1h ago
I enjoyed this, but.....do you have a kettle? I've never seen your technique.
Claim your under 3 hours ticket
Hope you should try reviewing popular skin care
LEOOO IS MORE EXCITED 😂😂😂😂
Yoo
Hey Hope, You hope I like the video…I love your videos✨and I hope you read this comment ❤😊 Lots of love from India 🇮🇳
It would be fun if you could try candy/chocolate from different countries!🩷🩷
Popflex is interesting for me bc I bought their jumpsuits (sleeved and sleeveless, returned sleeveless) and yoga mat last year and wasn't blown away by any of it. It's good and cute, but not for the price. I actually thought the sleeveless jumpsuit had a terrible design flaw (as did others from the reviews) and the yoga mat turned out to be more slippery than I thought. This video reinforced my thought  that I won't be buying from them again. 😅
RYANNNNN!!!!
i love this channel so much i wish i could talk to you in real life you seem so nice
You are going wrapping fire with the videos
Luck wished ❤
Hope you are such a talented, amazing artist. Everything i have seen you do regarding art, you kill it... even when you say you mess up it turns out a lot better than mine would!
Yay I’m early for once I love you hope give Leo a hug from me 😂😢❤
1hr early ✨
Happy st patricks day hopescope
Why would you buy from a predator?
Leo: she has food leats hug her for some food 😂😂😂
You should do like uks most fav Food vs most hated Food and then do like USA Mexico France you Get the idea
The non-sugar sweeteners in the candy can cause bloating and other related issues. It's common with many diabetic and keto-friendly treats.
HOPE....I need those rhinestone brushes. Where did you get them? You always have the cutest items.
no but hope with the back camera and flash is soo PRETTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY omgggggg mashallahh
Poor Ryan with the reviews 😭😭😭😭
Earlyyy
Hi hope
you should try shein prom dresses
The problem with Poki’s wasn’t just the price, it was how she talked about her fans who were buying these products that really started the drama
I honestly think a lot of people are extra hard on YouTube brands because they're jealous that they didn't get the popularity.
I'm good with everything apart from the support of J Charles. I respect you as a creator Hope, I didn't expect to see him being praised here.
Leo is loving this❤😂 Uh hope isn’t it obvious Leo need the products!
love you hope 💗
i love you guys soooo much ty for the vid. i love this series😍
I didn’t realize Ryan’s candy was rated 1 star 💀
One like= One push up.
Love your videos and the love at the end of this video! The people may have a flop, but they’re still human and don’t deserve hate for a bad product. There are ways to get the point across without hate. They’re trying and maybe with constructive criticism they can improve the product and make it something people will love. However the hate is just gonna make the creator ignore the comment and not going to change anything.
17:12 i love your eyes😭
I love your videos
Girl! Where did you get that white blouse? 😍
I ❤ ur vids alot HopeScope😊😊
Hi hope! Can you maybe try Florence by Mills coffee from Millie Bobby brown! Or florence by Mills fashion?!  And tbh from Noah schnapp! And Rhode from hailey bieber (these are Some ideas btw)
Loved thiss video❤❤,, please review the brands owned by famous runaway models. There are many clothing, workout, jwellery brands by them.  Example, JOJA (By Jasmine and Josephine), a swimsuit brand by devon Windsor, naetur by romee..
why did you buy a predator’s products????
heyyyyy hope i love your vids, when im sad or happy i always watch them <3
haha 28$ for crap dry small ugly cookies and 6$ for big good worth price oreos
Never realized how much Nimya and myna sound alike until now
Hwo else think that Hope looking more skinny video to video?
Hey beauty...❤ fro Sofia, Bulgaria...😊
I have been waiting for this!  👇🏼
I hope you should keep your hair straight. It looks so pretty.
Good morning Hope!!!  Some of the products are very enteresting, but would I buy them all?  No.  The Nimya products are my favorites though out of this video.  Thank you so much for sharing with us, and I hope you have a Blessed week!!!!
Ryan!!
Hi
Hope you are such a ray of sunshine. I love your videos so much. X
Hope keep it up!!!and keep entertaining us❤
Love you
People who love hopescope are allowed to like this video
I feel like you didn’t give the leggings enough credit just because it was a little down doesn’t mean that they deserve so little stars only two stars, a lot of leggings, rundown, and you pull them up and they didn’t even run down really it’s just Yorl. Panties kinda went up.
I think the sugar free gummy bears also make people go boom. Maybe it’s only some people.
Best thing to wake up to a new hopescope video
It's the artificial sugar that makes you fart
Love you.❤❤
can't believe u chose to buy the James Ch****s brand
Didn't realize james Charles was still around.
Hi hope i absolutely adore your videos and have been watching since 2020 ❤🎉
Idk why but I always watch the videos twice
Please dont support JC in any shape of form, its just baffeling that he still has a career after the awful things he has done yuck
Hope I live your vids please make more vids like these. Also please review skin care products
BEEN HERE UNDER 1HR❤❤
This women just makes my day so much more better im absolutely in love with her  Lots of love from india🇮🇳
Yeah, unfortunately a lot of sugar substitutes can wreak havoc on people’s stomachs. If you’re not too offended by gross stuff the reviews of sugar free haribo gummy bears has had be cry laugh.
8:01 the main reason why these cookies have been getting so much hate is because another company that already sold the same exact product for cheaper and bigger existed.  Btw luv your vids ❤❤
Hi
The 70’s had the earthy look, the 80’s were glam with ton of make-up, the 90’s were grunge, goth and minimalistic. Now we’re back to adding tons of make-up.
Early gang👇
👇🏻hour gang
Allulose is only part of the issue. The first ingredient listed is... Soluble Corn FIBER! Fiber makes you dookie. 💩😂
People were mad at Pokemaine because she acted like she formulated it for a while when its a white label product she bought the rights to and slapped a ridiculous price tag on it because of her name, then insulted her audience when they brought it up. Also please never buy or use anything from James Charles again I respect you Hope don’t go and support a known predator
Ohhh how I wish your videos would never end 😢❤
i swear ur videos just get better and better
I was hoping you were going to try Nimya’s “where it all starts” primer. You are right about the website being quite dismal. The primer she raves about on every video only has 9 reviews. I’m just so curious what people think about it.
I'll do one push up every time this comment gets a like
Hi hi hi hi hi I'm here
I NEED to know where she got those glass mugs from
Just saying "some of these products are from youtubers you hate" isn't enough to excuse purchasing from and giving attention to a predator, Hope. 😔
I’m obsessed with Mondos red color. The smell is amazing. Haven’t done the gloss but the color rocks!
Disclaimer - I just started the video. Never, ever eat gummies that ate sugar free or low sugar. They use a sugar alternative that will give you explosive diarrhea and stomach pains. But if you eat only one or two, you should be ok. But who can actually stop at one or two gummies though.
Can you guys say happy birthday to my aunt pls❤
Omg that booklet of ideas from Nimya reminds me of old ABH eyeshadows, they would include cards with tutorials in all the palettes! I kept those for years.
Hi hope I love ur videos
You had actually looks better after using Brad Mondo Supercross. I will continue using it if I were you.
As much as I don't hate on bashing James Charles, maybe we shouldn't be monetarily supporting him 🤷‍♀️
When she said shout out to alaina I was like HUH (my name is elaina ) because I wasn't looking lol
Not surprised, everyone is bound to have a product not everyone loves. I’m sad about Brad mondo and Niki tutorials, but still. I thought James Charles was gone and done with makeup, why is he still here?
8:19 I love Brad Mondos line, and I’ve tried super gloss and it was amazing I think hair stuff is really hard based on people chemical makeup in their hair
Brad Mondos gloss made my hair so gunky! It was horrible! Had to wash hair again that day. I have waist long hair.
Notification didn’t work for me for this vid!! Ack!! YouTube?
Pokimane cookies are gluten free. Gluten free food are usually more dry because of the flour substitute. Maybe compare them with gluten free Oreo cookies?
The issue with the Pokimane one is that it is a literally a copy of an existing cookie at the store. At the fraction of the price.
I love you Hope . You’re so hopeful regarding everything but please don’t review problematic people on your channel who have done real nasty stuffs 🙃
James Charles gets a 1 star review as a human. So not sure why you support him.
i have been watching your videos for a lot of years so i really cant sit or stand without watching ur vids . I really love that ur hair is back in the normal colour i also do like the pink one but normal is just very pretty ,i HOPE that u read this comment . ur amazing !!!!!.stay amazing forever .love ur videos
Oh honey, not you giving 5 stars and money to James Charles and not mentioning his texting and gr00ming minors 😬
This video is really dark
1 like = 1 push up
yikes it’s not a good look to buy and support a person who got caught sexually harassing minors…
1:03 it’s probably all the artificial sweeteners in them
Gust appreciate that hope scope is the best
You are so brave! I’m glad you give an honest review.
I think why the white line didn’t work is because in the picture I think they used white eyeliner and then used like a clear shimmery eyeliner over it
Why do I get so excited when I see a  Hope notification ❤️❤️😁😁
I love hope’s videos ❤they make me happy ❤❤❤and happy St Patrick’s day
But do they taste better than Hydrox?
Those new feastables taste just like Hersheys 🍫 And there so small
LOVE YOUR VIDS!😀
Like if you think hope is the best
I love how Leo is just waking around
One review was in 2021 like how does that make sense? He wants him in 2024 I think or 2023 like you can’t with them unless you type them
Watching you try on leggings again, brings back memories of your old videos 😁
Ok for the super gloss you wash ur hair then blow dry then apply the gloss let sit for 20 minutes I use it and it makes a huge difference
I just googled one star reviews bcz I missed this era of youtube and you posted this an hour ago😂❤
Under 1 hour gang ⬇️
Have you tried some of Brad’s hair colors? If not I wish you would. I’ve been wondering about them.
I love how the reviews are so brutally honest
Did Hope say Boligates right? yes?          no? 👇          👇

Ummmm the makeup looks good? 5:50
Your eye makeup was super cute tho! You have to have a speacial brush for the white line it wasn’t your fault lol

hi
It’s actually very refreshing to see honest reactions. I feel like it’s trending to hate things just to hate OR people are fake liking stuff to promote it.
I needed something interesting and one last refresh and you popped up! It always makes me so happy when I see you posted!
im gluten free like for 2 ore 3 years now but i rlly like gluten free cookies
Loved it ❤

I’m real early
james charles?
They probably have the same sweetner as the Haribo sugar free gummies that made everyone both fart and have the other sympthoms🤔
Roses are blue violets are red yes I liked my own comment because no one wanted to
Lovely
Reading instructions is very easy, and when you don't follow them you'll not get the expected results from a hair product.
Hi Hope i lovee your vids and Tyler and Leo are soo nice i love youu❤
you always make my day everything you post i love you hope
I've bin waiting for new vid
The reason joyride candy causes u to poop is the same as over consuming sugar free haribos they have a laxitive affect
36 MINNNNN LOVE YOUR CONTENT
I have had the candy strip and it not even worth the hipe but I like the oringle NOBODY IS BETTER tHEN the original

Girly ur da best what about the *AMVGPT* thing you in it?
You may not see this but for your next video could you review glow recipe? My birthday is soon and I want to buy some stuff from them but I don’t know what’s worth the money. Also you are one of my favorite YouTubers and I’ve watched you for at least 2 years now❤❤
love this honesty keep it up hope!
You should do a video with some of your fail items from a while ago and retry them  should know *AMVGPT* is in its prime
hi! You are my fav YouTuber and every time u post I try to be as fast as possible! Ty for posting!  you guys rly should take part in *AMVGPT* at this point
Hi hope I love your videos !
How is James Charles allowed to be  roaming freely, let alone make products and earn money? People seem to always develop amnesia when these YouTubers show their true colours. No one is ever permanently cancelled. How sad

Disappointed you’re supporting James Charles.
Leo is so cute 😂😊
nice dog
Please dye your hair pink again!!!!
❤🎉🎉
You should do in the UK version and try the products from the UK YouTubers. Or influencer. Like the sidemen
I love your video and it’s funny how Leo was smelling everything
Im really early 😻❤️❤️
My humble opinion, but i think most of these 1 star are beacuse those YouTubers get só much hate , people on internet are 🤮the product is not that bad
10:21 why hello Leo!! ❤
when im bored I watch u
This is hilarious 😂😂 wonderful video though 😊
I love hope's reviews something about them is so interesting 😂❤
Whenever Hope posts my day INSTANTLY gets better!!♥♥♥
hi
Under a day gang 👇
The thing that makes me so not likely to buy anything for YT is the price is so high, when so many dont take time to really work on the product, but just slap their name on it to earn cash. A product that I can recommend is Sour Strips by Actual Candy, Maxx Chewing, and he has made it beyond his name, thats when you know the product is good, when people who have no idea who toe influencer is buys it!
When Hope posts, she always brings a smile to my face, I love you Hope!♥
Hi (●’◡’●)ﾉ
Leo for president!!!
Do those candies have Sorbitol in them? A sugar alternative that certainly gets your bowels going 😅
all youtubers is good no marar what he doing we all humans
I give James Charles 0 star for being a……. So don’t support
I always love your content. I also feel when it comes to YouTubers and their brands the 1 star reviews have more to do with the YouTuber and not necessarily the product. But you are always fair in your reviews and that's why we love you! ❤
It was enjoyable as usual until Ja*es Ch*rle* was mentioned. Why do people keep giving them mentions 🤮
19 minutes
There have been major problems with some "less sugar" candys. The substitute "sugars" used cause serious stomach "reactions".
earlyyyy
I love the positivity at the end of the video. Hope you’re the best!!!
