2:53 not every team has the pull of United 😏
Hahaaj
The more things change, the more things stay the same!  #closebutnocigar #artetaout
Five-and-a-half years ago Arteta out - wild! 😂
We're 15th 2:31 8:41
you'll never sing that, you'll never sing thaaat, CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE, you'll never sing that💀
This was when Arsenal fanbase was at their best. They've lost their spark over the last couple of yrs. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. I miss these days.😂😂😂😂😂😂
ARTETA STILL AT ARSENAL THO
Arteta In 😂😂😂😂
Still comedy 😭
Arteta is in forever ❤❤❤
Also, that moment when Troopz grabbed the mic, zaa was praying for his life.
And Troopz was asking for Arteta out 4 years ago. And the story hasn’t changed a bit.
Just seen this and remembered so that's where Man Utd are now
Dude saw God for a Second there..  TRUE FEAR!
Bro this was actually shambles. I thought it was bad in 2018/19 but bro we had no idea what was to come😭😭
It's been 4 years and Arteta's still there
2:31 Man Utd fans right now
Anyone after Man utd going to 15?
Hahahahahahha this can’t be serious ?
2025 anyone???
The fact that Tottenham are now 15th is quite interesting to see.
Watching this 4 years later is quite something!🤣🤣🤣
2:31
I miss this era 😢😂
We have come a long way
This Arsenal side is worse than Man United 24/25
As an arsenal fan i couldnt appreciate this videos back then but coming to them now has me in tears lmfao😂😂
To those who's here from DR Sports, we cookin
The way troopz has switched up
Why did this end ?? I remember watching, week in week out 😂
Hahahahha FFS and this is a guy who's supposed to know what he's talking about?! 😂😂😂  This ages really well 😂😂
Golden days
How has Troopz let this gem of a man walk away? This format was unbeatable, these two were pulling in views
Hahaha minute 2:32 is when zah feared for his life. Best troopz interview ever.
Man was right you know 😅 Arteta in, Troopz didn't have any patience
Watching this clip today, after all that Xhaka has contributed in his last two years under Arteta and seeing how the gaffer has transformed the club, it’s a powerful message for everyone: believe in what you do, stay consistent, be creative, and work hard—results will follow, and people will eventually change their narratives. Hats off to Mikel!
Watching this after Arsenal has been labelled the Professor Snape of the EPL 😂
Miss these days man… -disgruntled Chelsea fan
How much Arteta has changed is crazy
Whos here in 2024
Lol Troopz really a clown
9:02 my dad when I get 2+2 wrong
Time proved that Zar was right 😂
That Arteta out by Troopz aged well 😂
Zaha had faith ❤
2:30  2:31
Turns out za was right lol
The good old days
whos here  in 2024, top of the table, wating to face bayern in the champons league, Arteta still my manager😂
"grown ass men that have kids and all that shit" lol
4yrs later trust the process worked 🎉🎉🎉
@troopztv
@troopz
“I would rather see Azeez” is such a bad take 3.5 years on 🤣
2:34
😂😂😂 commenting from the future in 2024, have I got news for all of y'all
Troooooooooooooooooooooooopaaaaaaaa!
This is the best ever fan cam video ever. Legendary stuff.
Arteta relegated this fraud to live streams in his basement 😭😭
tbf Zah was right
Good times
Please come and say this again 😂
Trust the process 🎉😂😂😂
This guy knows nothing about football. Just a loud mouth with a YouTube channel
Who’s deluded now??? Wallad!!
Who’s deluded now??? Wallad!!
Who's here after the 5-0 win
Boy have we come along way since this zah backed the manager fair play
0:48 the camera man did him dirty
Big man ting 🤣
No way the cameraman didn’t break during this comedy sketch
LACABLOODCLAATZETTE
Now way this is three years ago
got nothing against arsenal, but life was more entertaining for the fans of 19 other clubs when arsenal were crap. For the greater good, bring them back to fifth 🤣
AFTV in 2023: ARTETA IN ARTETA IN
Auoar would have in fact, signed for a team in 15th based on where he is now lol
This didn't age well.
Lol troopz needs to come here revisit his bad-mouthing
How's he feel now though?
Troopz is all emotion, with no logic,he's like my mrs. My prediction is this "Arteta out" call won't age well at all, and he can't take it back...
This vid will always crack me up
It's great that we trusted the process
Here to check out old things😄😄
How things have changed ey 😂
This didn't travel well did it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Had to come back to this after Troopz left Barstool.. this will always be legendary 🥹🙌🏾
Who’s here after officially leaving barstool sports
I'm in 2023 and boy were we in the mud some few years back😂.. granit came goos finally last season so wasn't that useless after all and the season before was decent as well.. Glad we are back in title race talks ,, gud thing i didn't know much football back then 🤞😂😂. Also ,, we've brought in players like Declan Rice for 105 million pounds,,got some new additions like Gabriel Jesus.. and as things stand currently we got the most expensive squad in Europe or in the world also too. Saliba's playing too by the way 😂🤞.. It's happy days as a Gooner in the future 😤💯😊
So in the 23/24 season we just played our first hame against Nottingham,won the game 2-1 (made a really comfy game seem nervy somewhat in the end,🤞✨) and these were my thoughts on the game; We could've played better in my opinion,, but I'll take the win,, Saka with a worldie today 😤💫🙃✨😎.... Martinelli with some samba flair 💯✨😤🙌🙌for Nketiah's opener... Just got caught on the counter,,coz we had some tired legs and obviously we were inverting on the right hand side (thou personally I'd have luvd the clean sheet) today so we were a bit open on that side.... Happy with a lotta performances,, nothing much to  look too much into but can't wait for our next one at Selhurst Park ... Come on you Gunners ♥️😊💯✨💫😤..
Hahaha the man who just wants success yesterday
This aged like fine milk.
Aged well, ZAH YOU LEGEND
Still come back to watch this video again😂
This aged well 😂😂😂
Funny to see zah ended up being right
throwback to this😂😂😂2023 and tbf to arsenal they were in a tital race, arsenal were really in the mud
This aged well😂
This video went on well hahaha
2:11 2 years later, at least Troopz was right about one thing….
2 years later "BIGGER FISH 🐠 TO FRY EHH😅"
What a c##t
I wonder if anyone has shown this to Troopz now 😂
This aged well, zah was right from the very beginning
Omg this hit a mill😭😭😭 na big up troopz. But zah was right about arteta 🤣
Duh. Am seeing it after 2 years. God this man has been toxic. Wow.
Check your history Arsenal have been relegated once that was the 1912-13 season.
Zah won this war 😂
How can they look in the mirror they are fans not supporters 🤔
Arteta out is this bro mad innit
First I thought this didnt age well at all.. but when he said we are 15th.. well then I dont blame him at all 😂
I cant believe he has been with barstool for over 2 yrs. Still feels like he left just a yr ago
9th April 2023 today and we got Liverpool away later on today. Why has this come on my TL now 😂 so random
I came back to see how far we came. 😂
Just wanted to see who wanted Arteta out Troops
I remember these days man😭😭😭 i was patient enough 9 games to go
This aged well!
This aged like fine wine 🍷
Someone tell him 2023 Troopz is Arteta IN!
This aged well! Arsenal is now top of the league... 👀

No wonder why troopz had to do an Apology to Arteta, he roasted him back then n now feeling sorry

A lot can change in 2 years😭
I like coming back to these videos from the dark days. I'm happy the energy is better these days

This is aging quite well right now.

Lol he must feel like a right old mug now
Zah was right after all 😂 the look on troopz face after he said it hahahahaa , I was arteta out myself at one stage personally delighted I was wrong and that he turned it around 👌🏻
Clout chasing yo-yo. How quickly he changes his views to suit his pockets. Fake fans.

Good Times.😂😂
This was recommended to me how the tables have turned 🤣

Random comedian: So guys, wanna hear a joke? Audience: um, duhhh Comedian: Arsenal 😃
Aging really well since  cedric is "soooooooooooooo" good now
‘I stand by my brudda cos he’s got previouses’
Troopz don’t take his eyes off Zah man😂😂😂
A classic

0:48 why did the cameraman do that 😭😭
Every Friday evening after long weeks day of work I come to this to start a great weekend. 😝😝
Best video ever
Zah is cooked
Tlopz need to come down
Allardyce would actually do a better job than Arteta😂😂
Ty shrunk in the wash
Who’s here after we are 4th and about to play Spurs for top 4.
Who is here now😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
The way he just snatched the microphone from zah   Zah like can I have my microphone back
Aged well (maybe)
We are closer to the bottom then the top  Zah : me too
His a competing against ty
Arteta choose to play this scam football, xhaka is not a professional footballer fact
Arteta out
This will forever be funny
This match gave me stomach problems.
IT'S ABOUT TO HIT 1M VIEWS
Oh How the turn have tables
Arsenal in the top 4. 20.03.2022.
How we feeling now ?? Trust the process
Now what? clout chasing slags
Did arteta leave?
1 and 3 months later we are faves to top 4 and looking at CL next szn... trust the procces?
And now we could be in champions leaque
I cant believe a season before this club was fighting relegation
2:24 PEAK COMEDY RIGHT HERE 😭😭
The dwarf was right. Arteta now has the squad in pole position for fourth, lowered the wage budget, and absolutely smashed the summer window.
Imagine watching this right now and seeing how much change there has been in the gunners and how Troopz opinion has really changed about Arteta and the team! COYG!
A year later an Arsenal are sitting fourth with a brand new team
Arteta at the wheel
we're better now 😂
How times can change
Arsenal got relegated in 1913. Don't lie Troopy
A year later and it turns out Zah was right😁
1 year ago and its still a classic
This is so iconic😂
Every now and then we need to come back and watch this video
Troopz looked like  the undead 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂when he looked at zah ,when zah said you heard me artea in
Noticed  A few more views since finally the ex has moved to barstool sports. Now with troopz it’s a big man ting. The interviewer was right dead players how can a dead manger out won’t fix it c
Its funny how your complamenting the players of arteta yet you still want him out 10 games in a row you fake of a fan
How time moves, Arsenal now is 10 games unbeaten and Troopz is Arteta In lol
"WE'RE 15th YOU FUCKING WALAD!!!!!"  💀😂😂😂😂😂
3:34-3:45 i can't stop laughing at their frustrations😂😂
Just reupload this today. No need to make new video
Fight fight fight
Mini Robbie😂😂😂
"we 15th u fuckin wallad"😂😂 - its tradition to come back n laugh
Troopz is so jarring when he starts shouting
U now want carmer its hot u want Wenger out u gone shit since
This is fake
20th now 🤣🤣🤣
If only they knew then that real relegation battle is coming now
RIP Arsenal, Troopz has been delivered the truth but Arsenal fans still believing the process. Keep dreaming 🤣😂🤣😂 You better get your seatbelts on because you next destination is Championship
15th imagine now that their in 20th place
there's a tradition to come back every month to watch this interview
8 mounts later ..... how many time needs this manager?
if you smeeellll what arsenalll is coookin     team is bottom of the league*
The camera man is on some joke ting showing the box 😂
Lol watching this september 2nd.. nothings changed
Zah doesn't hv much of a say, he's more of a hearing aid
8 months later this is still relevant
8:40 one of the funniest insults I've heard from troopz lmao😂😂😂
Well, thomas partey did
Troopz shouting big man ting to a dwarf 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
“We 15th” , currently 20th September 2021 😂
WE ARE 15th.   not really... you're 20th LOL.
**Fast forward 8 months**  Arsenal bottom. 0 points. 0 goals scored. 9 goals conceded.  Trust the process. 👀
8:40 actually it does, it's all about the money. give Messi 100M per week and he'll comes to Arsenal.
Relegation Battle On Trust The Process
Trying to speak on the mic, while holding the mic himself, but pointing the mic to mans it's legit! 😂😂😂😂 1:36
Here after the Man City thrashing💀
Zah: “Erzil”
I cant take this video seriously, that guy is standing on a beer crate to argue
i cant wait to watch his rant after they get relegated this season
Troopz... i see how this is relevant this season,  no european footy u was spot on
This was 8 months ago and Arteta still here and Arsenal are worse 😭😭😭
Troopz was right it seems lol
Still valid till this day
Troopz speaks a lot of sense but cut down on the fucking swearing. Whoops, apologies. 😂😂😂
Who is here 8 months later?😂😂😂
2:31 The way he grabbed the mic from zah lol
“WE’RE FUCKING 15th YOU FUCKING WELLAD” 🤣🤣
0:49
2:29 he got shook😭
"we ain't gon play Europa next year..."    *You were goddamn righty*
Zah arteta in😂😂😂😂
Cant believe these make money talking shite
Re-watching this after the Brentford game🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:30
Money would fix it all. Not in 1 year. but in 3-5 years it would.....take Man City for example.
And we've just lost 2 nil to brentford... is Zah really gonna sacrifice the victory throne for some Spanish legoman when there's a bloody Italian stallion just waiting for a job...
Who else got recommended this after Brentford beat arsenal 2 0 lol
They have the the most stupid and brainless fan base in all of football.
2:31 WERE FUCKING 15th  Today: well ur 20th now🤣🤣🤣
whos here after brentford
Why fire shots at big Sam 😂😂
Did troopz call little guy big mantis lol
I like troops passion: but it's rude to grab things: big man tings
It was funny at one stage i though a fight was going to break out.
That kit is atrocious
troopz saying big man ting to a dwarf is the funniest thing i have seen in my life
Watched this, will never forget
Him: Ozil is better than Smith rowe  7 months later: takes ozils number
No European football next year, he jinxed that 😂😂😂😂😂
2:55
I'm glad I'm not an Arsenal fan. Blues all the way. I just enjoy this vid
What’s this bar stool sports? More like bare tools sports
2:31
Hornswoggle vs carlito
I'm here for 1:32
The best meme ever at 1:32
Am I the only who keeps seeing this on my recommended? Troopz already knew how our season was gonna end 😓😓
I love troops.   👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Troopz knew there would be no Europe next season
areteta out for life  hes managing is disgraceful
Man said shout out to the mondem
Troopz predicted at 2:45 there is no european football for arsenal next season
Man this makes me feel so good after that "bodied" rant after winning 1-0 against United.
The cameraman done him dirty at 0:48
I love how you can tell the difference with American camera work and British camera work
This man congratulated the board at the close of the transfer window. He then said Manchester United would finish 10th. He then said “We have a manager. You have a PE Teacher”. He then said Arsenal will finish top 4. Then he said “I’m excited. I can’t lie”. This meltdown is beautiful.
2:42 troopz predicted the future
Zah is so deluded
Called it
Who's here after the Villarreal match?👀
1:33 lil stroke there 😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Who is here to watch Troopz praise Ceballos after last night's Europa semi-final game against Villareal
Showing his drip 💧 😂😂😂
No Paco Rabanne go home with a man! He is right Arsenal have not had a season this bad I can remember.
I like it, it's way more off the wall than AFTV! Keep it up!
Well this dude needs to put that wrath on Kroenke not that little man 🙄🙄
Out fucking Arteta
TROOPZ: WITH YOUR CHEST! LOL
3:41 😂
I have to keep coming back to this.. I fucking love this ! You fucking WALLAD!!!
Zah met Ty on the live you know!!!! Hurry up with that colabo
2:34 legendary moment
Zah is never an Arsenal fan. They made him do a bit of research on Arsenal before Troopz got there. Americans set up everything.
This is the greatest interview of all time
1:33 zah speaking his own language
Troopz vs zah wwe
This is top ten Troopz rant👍😁
I can’t take Americans talk about football seriously
Trooptz is the football version of Gordon Ramsey
take me back to the good all times
I’ve not heard him say blud once😭😂😂
POV: your here for 2:31
“Yeah you heard me, arteta in.. “ I mean when troopz snatched that mic where was that “yeah you heard me” energy zah? 😂😂 ahh likkle man is a funny one uno
Oh shut up .....
8:40 2:31
Robbie looks nice with hair
We all know that it is scripted
I absolutely stand by this statement: Troopz's use of the English language is a thing of beauty. He's near Shakespeare level with his creativity. It is fucking quality! "Are you fuckin' deluded? Big man ting nah, big man ting". I could quote him and his diction all day!
And now they are 11th near March.  tRuST tHE pROcESs
Troopz about the shank this man
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who else keeps coming back to this iconic vid 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
This big man ting now 🇦🇺❄🇸🇩
😂😂😂
"You said 2-0 with your chest " 😂😂😂😂 "With your chest "😂😂😂😂
Big man ting...are you deluded hahaha
Hes speaking Facts btw
Troopz I can’t believe this brudda is saying arteta out?
2:55 my parents when they see my maths test
0:08 when the teacher finds out you have been talking
2:31
1:34 me in a maths class and the teacher asks what the answer
2:25 lmfao
You belong in 15th
8:35 I never knew Troopz was Italian
Hearing an American use "mandem" just makes me keel over in pain
My fav line out of the entire video😋 2:31
It's like Zah is getting abused by his crazy father
W E ' R E F I F T E E N T H Y O U F U C K I N G W A L L A D
This aged well....
2:30
Troopz doesn't let Zah respond lmao
How you feeling now Troopz?
3:03 that would be Ødegaard
Arsenal 3...Southampton 1...Soooooo
never forget this! troopz going over there was as good for us as ozil leaving #toxic
2:30 lol
So arteta has control over players anger now🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is great
2:30 and 8:40 and 9:45 💀
Bellerin can't defend. So already Cedric is levels above him
Zah is an American Ty
8:40
Yoooo why they had to show the stool tho lmfao
Believe it or not, Arteta is on the right track. As of writing, Amongst the 20 (give or take) Arsenal managers that have managed at least 1 season, Arteta has the 3RD HIGHEST WIN PERCENTAGE (54.55%), behind Arséne Wenger (57.25%) and, ironically, Unai Emery (55.13%). To put that more into perspective, Arteta is well ahead of dual First Division winning coaches Herbert Chapman (49.64%) and George Graham (48.91). You have to STOP calling for managers heads every time they have a bad spell. Literally only Arséne Wenger and Unai Emery have done better than Mikel Arteta (so far) at Arsenal, and you were the same people that called for Wenger's and Emery's heads. If this is Arteta at his worst, then statistically, Arsenal has a lot of great years ahead of it. Provided the board doesn't listen to reactionary videos like this and sack him.
I zubbed, I love barstool and AFC, now I can see big Mandem Troopz do his ting! Much love!
Can’t stop watching this one. Gotta say, Zah handled the whole thing very well. The man kept his nerve. He got balls
5:00 WTF !! 😂😂😂 He had to interrupt 😂
Man this guy is higher than arsenal in the league table
When Arsenal fans are deluded to think that they will make it on top again on the 15th place🤣🤣 BANTER CLUB!
Well this aged well
Jonathan coach interviews the rock
Even if asana throw money at players they’ll just get merceneries who will be there for a paycheck with no ambition
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Sidemen need to react to this video
2:31 Lol 😂
If u guts dere wondering where he says there fucking 15th it’s at 2:32
Why the camera pan down to the box 🤣🤣🤣 what a joke of a video
Troops needs to take it easy, he is young but when approaching his 40s he may get high blood pressure. I feel his pain, am a Arteta out , he puts players based on emotions not form.
2:30
this gave me the biggest WWE backstage vibes ever lol
Can we appreciate how quickly this became Troopz’s second most popular video on his channel.
Yo Arsenal fans go to United stand when you get relegated
Trueeeeee
50 seconds the camera looks down at the box he’s stood on 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ARTETA OUT
What a wanker troops is. No need to bully someone like that whether your right or your wrong. It's a bloody game for christ sake!
Troopz the ignoramus
Maybe, the players just suck ass and its not only the manager
Comedy central Prats
Arsenal losing is pure entertainment for us 🤣🤣🤣
This supposed troopz man needs professional help. No class, no brains and thats why people watch him. Its the same reason people watch the x factor the first few weeks. To watch all the bellends!
I'm sure this is even funnier in English
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i am a man utd fan i love watching arsenal t.v
Spreading toxicity and creating bitterness amongst Arsenal fans around the world.
He mocked it by saying big man ting
This is a circus now, you are just about views and i dont blame you.
😂😂😂...am laughing with tears
Tyrian Lanister got a tan!!!
Why can't he talk properly??
🤣🤣 this is beyond comedy. What a joke of a club
Damn Troopz can cut a promo
"Big man ting now" lmao🤣
they need ozil
Burnley living rent free in Chelsea and Arsenal fans heads I fucking love it
Within 9 days Zah went from Arteta in to No comments
Quality content right here
We need Özil back and xhaka needs to piss of with with bellerin
Yankee jit lol
"I'll take Sam Alderdice right now!" 😂😂
This guy wanted Wenger sacked.  Then he wanted the frenchman sacked.  Now he wants Arteta sacked??  How about this Troops sacks himself
the man a run the thing like some basic school  him deh punish the man dem like a baby them
Its only a game
Troopz asking him questions whilst holding the mic away from him 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
bar stool popping champagne after this interview: this is why we paid youtube transfer record fee. Troopz the Messi of fan cams
You're all fucking disgraceful! You call yourselves *ARSENAL* fans?! Arteta deserves to stay, PERIOD. He's doing a wonderful job and he is bloody brilliant. Arsenal are better than before. *ARTETA IN!*     🤣🤣😂😂
Troopz stop embarassing yourself. m.youtube.com/watch?v=XM2whSPen9A
The only thing winning here is Troopz TV #views
Fake as WWE
2:31 is the reason your all here for.

Troopz vs arteta with zah as a manager in a hell in a cell match in wrestlemania 😂
Be the bigger man Troopz
Big man ting...... Lol

Özil in, Saliba in!!! Arteta OUT!
Troopz speaking fax
How can arteta still be in
Keep these videos coming please.
American version of Ty..
“Money fixes everything” okay so how did City and Psg not win ucl then 😂??
Telling Lil Man its a Big Man ting seems a bit harsh.
Love the passion and heart troopz! But I also love where arsenal are in the league been a Chelsea fan
😂😂😂
0:47 😂😂😂😂
why does this look so staged man ffs
Missing troops in AFTV videos
I cant take this lot serious.. what is this minimi clown class shit..
lololololololololololololooolololololololololo
Looks like they're interviewing in a community centre or youth club. Probably the latter with the way these two look. lol
This feels like a backstage wwe interview
Arsenal are fucking shit 🤣🤣   Love from Chelsea
supporting arteta out
Imagine letting someone talk to you like that 🤦🏼‍♂️😂
What does Evvoh mean?
Why is he shouting at him. Troops just screaming at a dwarf wtf

Bullying at its finest

They can’t even talk properly 🤔
0:05 Top 10 acts of bravery.
Just wanted an RKO out of nowhere 😌😌😌
Arsene Wenger must be at home eating popcorn laughing at this
The way this was going... I was waiting for the short guy to say:  "HULK HOGANNN... WE COMING FOR YOU NIGGA!!!"
2:29 onwards🤣😂
Robbie would have never let troopz grab the mic like that 😂
Can you imagine next season’s interviews after taking an L against Luton Town or Millwall😭😭😭😭 Talking about “ at this point we won’t make the playoffs!!!!”😭😭  RIP ARSENAL
Why do l hear a slight Zimbabwean accent from your man!?
Yo the camera man violated it showing the box that the guy is standing on I’m dead 😭😭😭😭
What confused accent is this?
It looks so staged hahaha like they are acting it out
“ dead ting in the rave” ? Say what LOLLLL
Robbie looks different
Barstool uses Troopz as a joke. Sad really. They are gonna biff this experiment
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I think if united fans started to act all gangsta, I'd go and support someone else I think 😂
My god why is everyone at AFTV a child. He just snatched the mic and started screaming at him. That’s a grown ass man
Bet they wish they didn’t get ride of wenger now 😂
Dis ain't a RANT man. Troopz is 100% muthafuckin right mate!!! He -Is -Right!!
"with your chheesstt"
There was never a process! 🤦🏽‍♀️ Arteta is scam! 🚮
Camara guy is fuck up by showing the interviewer is on a box🤣🤣🤣
Hornswoggle and the rock back stage interview
“Bro”
Man said big man ting
It’s time to GOOOOO
2:30
This is no mangers fault! I said this a very long time ago Arsenal need new goal keeper,two centre defenders,two full backs,two cente midfielders two wingers, plus alot of back ups! Ur talking about 14 players! Even Alex ferguson would have struggled with this team
Give the dwalf back his mic😆😂😂😂
LOOOOOLL THE WAY HE GRABBED THE MIC LIKE THE AUX 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Give em hell Troopz
Troopz TV and AFTV is everything wrong with your club. You know..... When Arsenal looses everyother supporter watches these guys loose it. Man, Arsenal have lost respect
What's mind blowing was that I didn't' even know arse were in 15th position.
"With your chest"  Troopz- 2020
3¼mips...eggnchips®€cu™   https://youtu.be/zsjTpFR0oYQ zxc
Do you know how mad you have to be to call someone a “fucking wallad” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WWE vibes
🤣🤣🤣 this is where I find laughter
MANCHESTER UNITED ON TOP
@51secs The camera man's alittle d##ish, lowers the camera to show Zah's bar stool he's standing on.
Why is Troopz leaving for America ?
WITH YOURR CHEST!!! Lmao I'm dead.
Ozil is next to xavi and iniesta arteta is full of shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
U need nunu esprito santo,bielsa
Absolutely shocking Arteta is worse
I kinda want to see Arsenal get relegated 😂😂😂
A very covid conversation.
Wenger back in
3:38 WITH YOUR CHEST!!!
Same old arsenal
Cameraman mocking it why he show the bucket man was standing on 😂
Waiting for Troopz to say “If you smellllllll what the rock is cooking”
RKO OUT OF NOWHERE
Payback for how you lot treated wenger
American adapting WWE vibe into english football. Looks staged yet arsenal approaching relegation zone isnt.
They sound like two 5 years olds, arguing over a toy ,
Whos here after the everton result
Bro if I was 3 foot and interviewing Troopz screaming in my face. I would shit myself. He’s scary when he’s angry
Man where did Troopz find the black Tyrion lannister from
Fuck arteta
This guy is crazy
HECANNOTCROSSABALLTOSAVEHISLIFE!!!
This is so obviously scripted lol
bushwick bill loves arteta doesn't he?
he's standing on a box lmao
"big man ting"... Awkwaarrd 😂
Yuh damn right.......Arteta needs to go. He isn't ready for Arsenal. I saw them play against Burnley and I had to blink. They didn't play the way Arsenal play...............they seem to have no direction. Arteta has to "S" the spot.....................dat means leave Arsenal
Such a baffon this guy is...  Not always the manager's fault..  Licking Arteta's arse when he won the FA cup and now wants him out..
8:36
No American will know more than Troopz, are at least enough to argue and back their points 😂 Troopz is going to lambast everyone in the US 😂
There is no reason to believe in Arteta. He's so inexperienced. Big Sam would be better.
Robbie's shrunk
Time for Arson to come back...
Get this lil nigga a smalling Jersey GGMU       🖕🏾👁👁🖕🏾
I really like the little guy! Colour me a fan (if that word is still allowed)!! Subscribed.
I feel like this guy needs to remember it’s just football 😂
This clown is TY 2.0 😏 , totally agree with troopz #Artetaout
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
2:32 the short guy’s life flashed right before his eyes 😂😂😂
Shaky cam and everything. He really is in America 😂
Arteta In! <3
3:13 pree the way zah opened his mouth tryna speak😭😭😭😭😭
Man took the mic of zah LOOOLLL
I blame the white shirt, fuck we wearing white for
“We’re the dead ting in the rave”🤣🤣🤣
The moment Troopz grabbed the mike made my day😂😂😂😂
the stool he on😭😭😭
This is a fucking abomination to the idea of football in general.  This isnt passion , this is packaged anger for the growing army of dummies that are not real fans. They are zombies . Frankenstein monsters built out of internet bullshit.  Taglines , memes , rants like this made especially to keep the levels of bollocks topped up in their half zombie brain..        Listen dummy this is whats gonna happen..  We will weather this shit.. Players will come back.. form will come back..  and the real supporters will come back TO SUPPORT!!!
THAT LOOK🤣😂😂😂
You shouldn’t belittle those who are already little troops 👎🏾 move
grown men.
The only manager in the league who has less tactical nous than Steve Bruce, sad but true I'm a mag but feel sorry yous fallen well beyond the Arsenal standard , this manager needs out .
KSI is a little gunner now?
Hey troopz...... Remember the Liverpool arsenal combined 11........hahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha hmmmmmmmmm
Waiting for Troopz to kick away that crate 🤣🤣
8:41 had me rolling 😭
Troopz is funny as fuck g
#COYS
How can anyone take an American serious talking about football let alone thinking hes a arsenal fan 🙄
It's like watching WWF from the Attitude era
Yo has Troopz separated from AFTV?
pretend fans who turned on their team years ago.
If ya seeeeeeeeeell what the troops is cookin 🤨😎
Time to support someone else, blood.
Troopz is going to smack him with a steel chair in a couple weeks 😂😂
What does he actually do other than an american aftv
yo my little man got scared for awhile
This man is the worst man to rep arsenal in the states.
Gronit shocker
Troopz has taken the mighty dollars and it must be hurting him bad he can’t chat to Robbie on AFTV!
Is Troopz still with AFTV?
haha Troopz going off
This cameraman was trolling
Cant take Yanks seriously who say mandem
The mic snatch is EVERYTHING 😂😂😂
I hate troopz he doesn’t even know what he’s talking about was one of the main guys who violates ozil
Petition for zah vs hornswaggle cause I’m seeing some wwe shit here
Dwarf robbie aint doin dem tings der, hows troops ended up with the mic? Robbie would ching man
Yo troopz fuck the ps, come back to ends
Hakimi.      Gabriel.      Upencarno.       Tierney         Ward-prowse.      Partey.    Sabitiser        M.diaby.            Auba.            Saka
😁😁. Aubameyang never sold out, stayed loyal, and you sell out going to America!. 😁😁 #whufc
Only Arsenal could get this upset about being 15th! Try supporting Fulham mate, we get nose bleeds at 15th!
Crybaby fc back again lol
Big man ting now 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz is going to do a Stone Cold Stunner next time out
Ust to be my favourite on aftv but the guy has sold out now profiting off failure
Has that plastic yank ever been to a game?
Hilarious, telling the little guy, “big man ting”.
Feels a bit forced
when the camera man zoomed in on the box i died
Arteta out 🖕🖕🖕🖕
This can’t be for real? If so I’d be embarrassed to have this associated with my team.
Funniest serious interview ever 😂😂
Troopz - Wenger and Emery were disappointments because they were both Experienced managers . I'm not happy with our performances either but Arteta is still in the beginning phases of a manager, give him more time to develop.
I feel bad for these Arsenal fans and I’m a fucking spurs fan
Thought he was gonna dash the midget
Dude made a career for being the Arsenal fan who would cry after every loss on AFTV during Wenger years but he has the nerve to say it wasnt this bad under Wenger LMAO.
Troopsz taking his frustration out on a midget LMAO
“If you want entertainment go and watch a bunch of clowns.” Welll.....
Sellout
Let me present the main event of WREEEEESSTLEMAAAAAAAAANIIAAAAA:
2:30 looked real fake ngl
Troopz wanted to rock him with that mic haha
The black guys accent doesn’t suit him lol
Are u f***n deluded,that had me laughing
17th December and still no wins 😂😂
This is dead
Cant blame the manager, same thing happened to wenger and emery all the time, pick your best team and they just dont perform
Yo troopz Man dem need u pa zed. Visit zambia bro
“ Arteta in still “ Troops “ your lying right “ 😂😂😂
"How can we better AFTV?"  "I dunno, urmmmmm, make Ty a dwarf?"  "Bingo"
One of the days, Troopz will throw zah out the window 😂😭
First ever time ive heard an American cuss.
Poor little guy “ he’s thinking holy shit I didn’t sign up for this” welcome to clown TV my friend! 🙈🤣🤣 and troopz ffs try and speak some English..... blud/ting/fam, absolute fucking moron as always!!
Robbie woulda smacked Troopz up if he grabbed the mic like that :L
Guendouzi was fighting for the badge... Arteta mishandled that one for real ..
Auba who? Auba who? Auba who? D;
2:30 😂😂
Arsenal is in complete shambles... as a Spurs fan I love to see it. But i could not imagine Arsenal being relegated...
Let me tell you something Mean Gene!!! Troops moving like Hulk Hogan!!! 😂
This short dude has no clue what football is ...
Who's giving the interview lmao
Tell him Man!! Arteta is pissing all over our legacy... where is Ozil??!! Why he playing 2 separate teams one for Europe and one for EPL..Auba is not getting any balls thru...where's the midfield ??
I love these guys. Saying it like it is. Wake up Arsenal before it’s too late..... or maybe it is. Sad to see this great club in turmoil YNWA
Boring!!!!. Go back when we won fa cup and beat city and liverpool. What did troops say then... lol what a joke.
Funny interview
I'm not an arsenal fan, I don't even watch the Prem, but I love watching this.
0:49 the violation
Hahahahahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️it.
😂😂😂😂
This shit is hilarious! Go Chelsea
"Dead ting in the rave"
Troopz has sold his soul lol 😭😭
Both need to be the bigger man and rise above it.
I was waiting for someone to attack troopz from behind... wwe
Sit down and keep quite fool. You have not being a fan but a bladders and shut up for Arsenal sake ......you can’t even coach a school side so stop. We don’t need your type ! What we need is support and encouragement fool. We are building it take time and money, with the kind of money ! We are lucky Mikel is willing to help. For Arsenal sake stay away.
Big man team blud! Ironic
Troops thinks he has the power to enforce decisions in AFC. What a joke. Now he doesn’t trust Arteta and the process. He has to be ashamed of himself with this Arteta out because he should know better than to think Arteta is the problem. Anyways, the board have spoken  Arteta IN
I think troopz would have done alright in WWE
I get passion but troops don't embarrass yourself and react like that when doing video reviews. It's not going to get you extra views!. Seriously, I have to cut the video short coz your tone of voice and attitude is baby like. tasteless
Don't shout in man's face like that bro... That was dead ngl.
money can attract anyone
“We’re 15th you fuckin Wallad” best quote ever
I always come here for this dude, he is so mad.
Mini robbie😮?!?!
08:32 😂😂
Why the camera man gotta violate man like that? 😂
"I take sam allardyce now"😂😅
It’s sad what’s happening to Troopz come back to London Troopz
Closer to the bottom than the top... Hasn't that been assanals motto for the last 5 years?
Wtf is this 😂😂😂
3:18 “Arteta in”🤣😂
i think he needs an octagon!!!
Always a joy to watch arsenal pissed about their shit club 🤣🤣this could never be my club
Troopz should bulk up and join WWE. Bring the Attitude Era BACK.
#troopzhassoldout
Why am I watching this
i think troopz needs to find a  new team to support for his mental health 😂😂
Shut up troopz
Give that mahn the mic back lol
HOW IN THE FUCK IS ARTETA STILL IN AT THIS POINT IVE LOST HOPE FOR MY CLUB IVE LOVED FOR YEARS AND TROOP IS RIGHT THERE IS BETTER PLAYERS THEN BELLORIN IDK HOW TO SPELL HIS NAME
Watched this in Australia just after seeing highlights of Gunners draw with Southampton. Another Arsenal send off! Can't wait for the next rant. Troopz...just keep your finger out of Zah's face. Just a bit intimidating.
What is worst , being an Arsenal fan or a midget. I think the 1st is more painfull.
Troops thinks he's the rock,wwe interview
I'm a arsenal fan what an embarrassing bloke all black talk can't stand it total prick
Small team small presenter haaaaaa
We know the Ozil situation and we know its political. Respect him so much for it though. 💯
MAN REMEMBERED IT WAS HIS SHOW AND grabbed THE MIC 🤣
Arsene should have stayed what's changed. I was wenger in. But under the great man the football was good now football is shit n results same
Troops man mans true though I didn't want arteta too big job too soon should have got ancelotti or allegeri
Troopz you said you was gonna hot up josh kronke so far the only man you stuck it on was Zaa
0:50 the real sauce
Panning down to the box was cold. 😂
Why is Troopz sqauring up to the black horn swaggle.🤣🤣
GET READY FOR another calssic interview. Arsenal down 1-0 to Southampton. 45 min left!.
WWE should give troopz a contract
Arteta and the board are a fucking disgrace. We are guaranteed to get relegated as things stand.
This interview had more of a script than Hollyoaks xD
Imagen if arsenal got relagated I would love to see his reaction if it did happened by the way the championship is alot harder to get out of
Imagine saying big man ting to a little guy lol
😭😭😭😂 even there fans are a mess 😂 💀 arsenal
This is so awkward
true what Troopz  says 100%
This is pure content making the lockdown lit.
Aubamayeng came to a team that wasn’t in the champions league lol
How do you shout "big man ting" at a dwarf
Thats over reacting .. he thinks he is smart. He does not represent Arsenal fans.
Camera man done likkle man dirty
Stop this madness! Stop supporting Arsenal!!!
Imagine troopz yutes are gonna have to view there big grown father acting like this daily on the net hahahahhaaaaaa
Swear troopz thinks hes in the wwe the pantomime clown
Fakeness
More than Arsenal supporters, others watch these to have more fun.
Who else hype for this to happen again today after they get spanked by Southampton 😆😆😆
Arsenal fans killing arsenal.just because your arsenal doesn’t mean you should be 3-0 up. Auba scored a cracking goal for Burnley.
With your chest out
What was troopz saying before he went to America artekkers weren't it, please. These players need to look at themselves and aubemyange needs to be dropped, Wright,Henry,Bergkamp,Campbell,Smith and even Wiltord are shaking their heads with embarrassment that he can't even score against Burnley
Always funny to see the fool ross proving  my point of being a even bigger fool as time goes, always a lot of hindsight and no knowledge of football whatsoever, he makes it impossible to watch aftv as well 🙄
Troopz, you need to be constructive not angry. Proper WWE energy.
just wanna say troopz ur now a international man , you are known to the Asian market, people are putting Chinese subs on these Hongkong football pages on Facebook , well-done man , they all love it !!!
Zah is Ty's son
Little Robbie 😂😂
He said to the midget big man ting 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gawd...Fuck Troopz. This dude is like the Alex Jones of Arsenal supporters
I'm voting troops to get into WWE..
This so so so fake, what a sell out eh
I do have a feeling Troopz is saying Arteta out just to be controversial and different
This wasteman along with the rest of AFTV has made a career out of Arsenal defeats he should be happy.
This is fire!!
When you grabbed that mic though I was 💀 🤣
Troopz is on some fake WWE shit. This is some scripted bolox mate!
kofi kingston & hunico
Touchdown Arteta 😂😂
Fuck Arteta
bellerin is the leading scorer on foul throws this season come on you gotta give him that!!!
This little guy needs to learn we want to hear troops. Don't care about this little guys opinion.
Did he just say big man ting to a midget 😂😂😂
1-0 is a hiding😂😏https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
Arteta out but ur saying the squads dead, so what’s sacking gonna change u melon
Everyone saying WWE it’s because it’s in 60fps & the filming style is very different to AFTV
WHY ARE GETTING THE MIC FROM THE MAN INTERVIEWING YOU
karaoke
He called him a WALAD😭😂😂😂
WWE interview🤣🤣🤣
Talking is very cheap...let's have an honest discussion. Arteta has only been there for a minute. He has not been given time to build his own team. Ole and Lampard have been backed big. Even Pep and Klopp some of the best in the business, struggled in their first season. They needed time to build a team to play to their tactical strengths and inprints. Arteta is not a magician, he needs to be backed big and be given time. No one, not Pep, Ferguson or Klopp will win with a shit Arsenal squad.   Look at the team Xhaka, Holding, Lacazette, Mustafi, Bellerin..these players will not win you big games even if you are Pep. Troops n these bloggers just criticise for the sake of criticism. If Arteta had been there for at least a season, had been backed like Lampard, had built his own team...then yes maybe. Troops, DT, are the we know it all fans who cannot even coach a pub team. Give the manager a chance. You can't hire n fire managers. Thank God them lots don't own Arsenal otherwise such grenade reaction to a manager who has only had one transfer is shocking...and disproportionate. Ole has been at Man U for 2 years and they are still backing him.... Arteta just 2 mins and Troops wants him out. Stop this clout chasing. Let's get behind the manager, ask the board to back him and stop this we not it all mentality..... Troops has never managed a team or run one. So please put some respect to people who are in the trenches.
Arteta in bro hahaha but the real problem is the board cause why did they went for Arteta instead of an experienced manager so for now u need to support Arteta and things will change for good and remember good things comes from hard times aswell
Was waiting for a “IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU THINK” from Troopz 😹
I like the vid and I think Troopz is great but it’s a weird format mate. You work together so it feels like a staged (excuse the pun) interview.
This is absolute trash.
I get zahs point. Unless the owners back the who ever is the manager of arsenal fc no manager can take this group of players to compete like we should be so why go through man after man with the same dead players. The kronkes have killed arsenal and now any man in artetas shoes will take the hit for the team he picks, which just aren't good enough
Respect to Arsenal. They might not get great performances these days but they have the most hilarious fans 😂 🙈 😄
WWF... Macho Man like Troopz
I'm not an Arsenal fan but this was entertaining, fair play for the comedic interview style. Turning disastrous results into great content.
This guy  cares more about putting on a show than talking sense.
😂😂😂😂 brought the banter to America
Holding is a donkey and he proved that in Aston Villa Match. This guy don’t know how to tackle all he do is back off like his life is under threat
Bellerin is a fucking sponge. He’s the only player taking foul throws in the 21st century.
He's stopped asking dya undastand
None of the managers we’ve had have had the bollocks to say fuck this shit and have a fuckin clear out. Why the persist with the same shit players is a joke. And when it comes to signing players we’re only gonna get the level of players that go to a Crystal Palace or a Southampton or a wolves, forget anyone elite coming to arsenal. The players we get are because none of the top teams want them.
2:31 😆😆
troopz target players
The way arteta handles his squad is disgusting
I wonder if Rwanda regret sponsoring this shit show
Interviewer: Arteta In, still Troopz: So you've chosen death
We are really going down.... Mikel needs to do something
You can tell who the real fan is just by watching this vid. Honestly, I'm not even an arsenal fan but how can people have a positive outlook on the future when a big club like arsenal, rich in history, very well established for so long says things like "trust the process" when the club is just hovering above the relegation zone. I hope the very best for you lot. #prayforARSENAL
Wwe on troops TV. I was waiting for an rko 🤣🤣🤣
Zah is deluded though 😂 i dont always back troopz but this one i back him
Lol this is what I luvs about barstool!! Don’t have to even be into sports to luvs this shit!!!
Who is top of the league while you are 15th?? CMON YOU SPURS!!!!!!!!!
I agree with troopz 100% big Sam would be better than the twat we have as manager
Arteta has had 2 transfer Windows not one or has everyone forgotten that mug brought in Cedric and Marri in January
Arteta out before things get worst  Arsenal want to kill me before my time, I can't even discuss football with people anymore because am an Arsenal fan.
January Arsenal signs Aouar and Troopz will be pikachu.jpeg
Troopz just being a moron in American now shm
@Troopz 0:14 dead ass lol.
Big Sam Can Successfully Relegate you to Championship Bottom .
do u smell what Troopz is cooking?
American Robbie or rob for short
troopz just shout nonsenses ... i love his passion , but he needs to open his eyes more , new manager with our dead players wont do anything
In theory, the manager is shit.
This is so fake this guy isn’t   Real arsenal fan. He is trying to make money. He should be quiet like everyone
I think the players are not playing for the coach. His rigid handling of the team is not producing results, let the team get a better experienced and a non deluded coach.
What a waste of ten minutes..should of stayed with aftv..
1 point in a month 🤣🙈 didn’t realise it was that bad managers got to go what a shame he has pulled off some decent results aswell oh well
Arteta IN
Camera man violated at 0:49 😭😭
I prefer AFTV the old original version of Troops, this is whole thing is too fake and it's not amusing anymore to watch.  Go back to UK Blod, you're done since you begin to use "Bro" instead 😒😏
i love this
Honestly if we get beat by Southampton & Everton I don't think Mikel will be kept
Arteta in
Had me at "not battling against Burnley" 😂😂😂
So irritating man
😅😅😅😅
0:51 Nahbhhhh😂😂Man got done dirty
Grabbing the mic all disrespectful 😂😂😂
U mean lmt
lol this guy thought top 4 and mikil artekars
As if Arsenal has the losing spirit since Arsen winger, when I was a teenager, I quit watching Arsenal matches. The management over think so much and end up fucking everything. When the players leave Arsenal some how the manage to regain their potential and surprise everyone! 😂😂. Not attractive team for football no grit or luck. Aubomayang is good player now look at him with the silly mistake, he will lose confidence.
Makes me wonder is Arsenal fans would take Poch as manager at this point?
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Zah what you have to understand your not replacing the number of players you need, that only happens in the NBA or NHL . In football, both sides of the pond, the Managers pay the price for. non performing players.
I think Arteta, has 2, more games to try and save his job. If Arsenal, end up in the bottom 3 he will be gone the same day.
Becareful what you wish for!!!. Wenger out, Wenger Out....now we are 15th and you left us for THE STATES.
Bing Man Ting, this is a violation...
Exactly what I was thinking, give youngsters more chance and they’ll have more heart to win the game, to prove their quality in the first team
If you smell what the crap troopz is saying !! Ya get me , yaunderstand,   it's like blud, ya get me ! Yaunderstand. Fuck how the yanks let this idiot into the USA, revoke his Visa!! Ya get me troopz,  yaunderstand
Listen, Troopz has got it spot on, but some of these Arsenal fans won't listen untill you really are in the bottom 3. A place you have no experience
Arteta not even that bad coming from a United fan, players dont give a fuck for some reason fuck off Troopz he aint that bad
Zah: How do you feel about the game?   Troopz: IT DOESNT MATTER HOW I FEEL
Senor Arteta out, you not fit for the Arsenal job.
Troopz man! Your a funny guy and I like your content. You don’t have to get abusive on the dude! Calling him a f...ing Wallad! It’s rude bro have some respect
Barstool is not ready for troops  😂😂😂
Hornswaggle sure looks different these days
Your 100% RIGHT BRO ARTTA IS A WANKER
Troopz: BIG MAN TING NOW YEAH  zah: yoo why you gotta do me like that?
Little man is kinda funny
How can troopz not know that his club have been relegated before? 1913
Yo I was watching Gillie the kid and his cuz wallo earlier that same stool in background in their studio. You see them man yeah troops
Troopz i feel your pain, but show more respect to your co host.
I still Trust the process,arteta in
3:40 with your chestttttttt, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Wtf is this, embarrassing troopz, this is a circus, hope they paid you handsomely for your self respect
All this fake emotion is pathetic , its all an act . No football fan in England gets this emotional about their team . Dont be fooled . And who would let a fool like troopz shout in his face for 1 second let alone 10 minutes ?.
This ain't the real troopz 😔 disappointing to see this job take the realness away
If you smellllllllllllllllllllllllllll,what troopz, issss cooking!!!!!!
When he randomly moved to the camera to the box🤣🤣
😂
Troopz grabbed the godam mike 😂😂😂😂
2:26 to 2:31 best part 😂😂😂. It gives me Wwe Vibes
0:48 lol
Great Khalil Vs Rey Maestro
Arteta in. Trust the process 😂😂😂😂😂😉😉😉😂😂
Rule number 1 for an interviewer is to not let go of the mic
Where’s the steel chair blindside shot and the paramedics?
“We’re 15th, money won’t fix that”. This new guy “money fixes EVERYTHING Troopz”... this guy really knows nothing about football 🤦🏼‍♂️
This kid can’t even realise he’s ruining his own club with his negativity 🤔🤣
Who ever loves troops? 👇🏿👇🏿
So, Troops is an actor now?
just get two mics ffs :D
Bit insensitive dropping "big man ting"
His solution to everything is a new manager, at least give the man proper time. Look at Alex Ferguson when he 1st started. I’m not saying Arteta is gonna be that good but I think you see my point
Man gave him the death stare at the start 😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine mark goldbridge doing something like this
We 15th you fecking wallak. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"The mini Robbie ' funny as fuck      COYS
Let's be honest, we miss Troopz. Proper dude man.
Were 15th you fucking wallad 😂 Whys troopz arguing with plastics now?
Why can't fans of Arsenal and Man United just focus on the real problems that's bringing down their respective clubs. The problem stems from the ownership...yeah both United and Arsenal can get better managers but a new manager is never winning the title if the spending isn't there. Fans have become reactionary...just to amass few followers online they indulge in useless debates and arguments and those penny pinching owners prosper.
The way my man brought the camera down to the box 😂😂😂
Time bandits fam blud ting
Troopz isn’t wrong last 8 games only 1 point
You are whining.   Boy. - You should be glad that you are alive & able to watch sports during WORLD WAR 3.
I feel bad for zah
2:58 Harsh choice of words
What is this programme supposed to be about. Why does it look like Troops talks over the other dude. Kinda Disrespectful to me. Sorry i dont feel this thing.
Hmm 🤔   Should Aubameyang still be captain?
It feels like a son arguing with his dad lolz
Ohhh troopz ur so hard starting on a 4 ft man
I rather troopz play than aubameyang
This is the Troopz we know! hard truth
Lmfao this is hilarious omg🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:49 What...! What...! What the hell was that cameraman!? F**k you cameraman! 😂😂😂
Burnley finished way up the table last year and have been in the prem on merit now for years, Arsenal! you dont have any right to claim you should beat a team like Burnley. Your team is on the back down to where they should be, accept it
Has Trooz split from AFTV?
Why the fcuk do you support Arsenal Because even when you were good you were always second best to us gonna be a long season for you guys MUFC cockney reds
They need 2 mics lol he’s like a lil boy getting told off at school 😂😂
Well let me tell you something brotha
9 minutes of rubbish
I felt bad for the man not a chance to speak troopz stfu
The short guy is definitely Zimbabwean .  💯 10000000000 million percent . His accent and his height . Mfanha wekaghetto uyo
😂😂 the UFC pre-match meet-ups are calmer than this!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is  troopz fighting with a dwarf🤔
You’ve got no right to win anything or succeed because of your name or history
Replace the whole eleven
Relegation would do you good
troopz the kind of guy that shouts at a baby to stop crying. utter prick haha COYS!
Is this real life or a pisstake... i get confused sometimes
Wtf is that 😔
Arteta,xhaka,Belerin and the rest should quit arsenal FC and Arsenal board needs cleaning inside them.
Troopz 100% correct on everything... sadly.
Troopz is completely wrong here. All he wants is the players to like him. Troopz is soooo wrong
You saying big man ting to a little man 🤣
"Against Dundullk"
Troopz sold out
Who reckons aftv will be at it next season, and will arsenal go straight back up to the prem? Hope aftv sticks with them anyhow
0:14 Arteta in........🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Troopz  is such a manchild 😂 Like let the other guy talk, no matter what his opinion is. Feels like on watching a mad 5yr old
Glad to see you doing well mate. 🤙🏼 wish you all the best and the success.
WWE vibes, as the interviewer looks like Kofi Kingston XD
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Six weeks ago he was your manager too troops.. ARTEKKA’s remember?!?! What a flip-flop, little man has more sense than you
Maybe you can be the manager for 1 match
This is nice. There goes freedom of speech.
Anybody wounding when the Under-taker going to pop up from the dead 💀... 🧐
Wont be surprised if Vince Mcmahon signs troopz to boost the falling WWE ratings
IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU THINK, THE ROCK SAYS
Why the camera man film the guy standing on a box 📦 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
YEAHHHHH ALLARDYCE IN!!!!!! ALLARDYCE IN!!!!!!!!
Wow I think troopz has finally lost it.
Troopz is like a Johnny Cochran lawyer for aubameyang, hell defend him no matter what until he becomes the manager of arsenal and messes upm
the rock and jonathan coachman vibes.....
Oh my God Troopz is so intimidating. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you think money will solve the problems you will be left with the same problems all over again, overpaid players who aren't good enough and those players that are any good, will leave for a better team the first chance they get.
0:08 troops reaction is when your mums says you can have pizza for dinner and then pulls a smart price one from the freezer
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I could watch this all day!
they support the same team tho
this is toooooo     funny
Troopz represents everything that is wrong with our fanbase. If Allegri were to come in and underperform he'd be saying the same thing, adn he also clearly knows nothing about how Allegri plays. He's not an offensive coach.
"arteta in ..trust the process" 🤣🤣🤣🤣it gets to me everytime
So we’ve found the American Ty.
Zah gonna be found floating in the Hudson River after 3 months with Troopz
shoutout troopz!
Amazing 😭😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Are the supporters wanting arteta out, the same supports that wanted wenger out ? Just asking 🤔
If arteta out then who? No manager with any experience to rescue arsenal won’t want to deal with the club they don’t want to spend big money no top manager wants to be at arsenal as long as they’re so tight fisted
Free Ozil
Troopz ya fucking fanny UTC 🤫🤫🤫
Lol
Keep him in 😂
Lol
The only process I trust is in troops arteta out t shirt business 😎 💯
Get Sol Campbell
Troops is lucky he didn't get a left hook straight to the knee cap  But all jokes aside the players are mainly responsible but the manager is responsible for picking them players
This guy is super rude!
robbie looks a bit weird
Has ty developed an American accent?
Big sam packing his gums ready for arsenal
They can't score, that's all.
Arsenal fans really think aouar is choosing to play w Arsenal over Juventus
Wonder when troopz is looking D him he’s thinking, i wonder how far I can throw him?
2:30 minutes had me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
#ArtetaIn
Internet is my inspiration! My mom said that if I got 1k subs on my channel she would definitely buy me a full gaming setup. Please it will help me out a lot.
Hilarious
This is by far the best combination in entertainment Troopz and Zan this is pure gold. Watch their reaction when Arsenal concede a goal its priceless. And I am loving the disagreements between them. This is the perfect duo and set for BIG things
Troopz moving like Terminator send for Young Marv
What happened to Robbie
Just so you know Willock can not do the job that Xhaka was to there to do, Willock is a box to box player who can play #10 role, he can fill in a LCB can he now 😞 The delusional toxicity is really lol
we need a rap battle between these two
I can troopz laying this guy out one day
Am I the only spurs fan who subscribes to this comedy gold? 😂
Lmfao Arsenal is just horrible. However swapping coach after coach after coach wont ever solve your problem, and the players also has to be held accountable. Arsenal is feeling real despair at this point. Nobody wants to play for this sorry club and the players lose form and morale. It’s truly trash.
Speak English blud
I learnt a new word today Wallad, thanks Troopz.
Troops still got hold of the mic right now 🤣
Maybe if Lacazette could finish would help
If I was Arteta I would have bribed this guy to keep silent .
what can you do?!! this club famous on making wrong headlines. "Arsenal in relegation battle" the worst GF & GA in club history.
come on .. who singing praises before that when arteta won the FA Cup with Community shield. changing manager doesn't help with this situation. it is the players problem.
This is soooo WWE, even the roving cam HAHAHAHA
😂😂😂troopz is a donny man the way he took the mic like nah little man you ain't having it back 😂😭
What everybody is forgetting player this not showing passion on the game anymore it all about money simple and Fooball is die ing now players want to win games and make legacy of their name and more the problem is the chairman not supporting the coach simply
So he's stopped saying blud, fam now?
If you can smell what troopz's cooking.
🤣
Troopz come on you cant shout big man ting at the little guy
Just do a choke slam
Best interview I've seen in ages !
As a chelsea fan it's funny to see arsenal fans fighting each  other like this
😩😂😂😩😂😂 coys
Bruh I’ve never laughed so hard in a while
Troops grabbed the mic off him and said big man thing now... naaaaa
#notmytroopz
You pay 500 grand a week for new transfer and see how.
What's the point of dropping Arteta. Wake up. It's the players!! We won the FA Cup and community shield last season. Beating man shitty, livarpool chelsea and manure. Players need to wake up and take responsibility!
Am not an arsenal fan but I feel like subscribing to this channel. These guys are just hilarious 😂
hahahahahaha
This geezer was shitting it when troopz took the mic 🤣
Arteta is good but he can't manage a big team like Arsenal. Mikel ain't good enough.. Bellerin has been bullsh## for more than two years now
Good job troopz, this should bring in the P’s
Lol interviewer is here to put gas to fire 😂😂
I'm a Tottenham fan and I think if arsenal lose to Southampton arteta will get sacked
Can you imagine, the year Tottenham win the league is the same year arsenal get relegated 😭😭😭😭
People saying arteta out is not right. The manager isnt the team. The squad arent taking accountability. Xhaka is experienced, captain for club and county, unacceptable behaviour AGAIN, shouldn't be playing, let alone in the team. Our team is no where nearrrrrr the top.of the league. We need a change of players end of. Arteta is the right man atm. End of
Troopz I’ve had so much respect for but don’t be a reactionary fan the players aren’t good enough the bk ups aren’t good enough there’s still like 19 20 players which aren’t his players there unai n mostly wenger still which means they love downing tools n not giving a fuck no matter what manager u get will b the same thing cz players aren’t good enough n we had bare chances don’t gas the ting bare chances to score I’m so disappointed that he’s become reactionary fan n what manager r you gonna get in cz there gonna have same problem we haven’t got ps to get another manager don’t act like these other players that’s in the squad are gonna b better the squad is still shit n Chelsea signed players finishing 9th acting bare dumb fam
I remade ocean eyes - Billie eilish
Lol Troopz never fails to entertain. Fucking loving this. COYS!
0:48
Robbie saw this coming from troops and didn't wanna handle it 🤣🤣🤣 poor mini Robbie 🤣🤣🤣
Lol troopz has gotten use to world class players like viera pires bergkamp van persie fabregas sol cambell cole. Lol get use to it blood you guys are an average club now
Troopz come home
Troopz frustration never gets old 😂😂😂
NAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH 0.50 MARK THE CAMERA JUST PANS DOWN TO THE MAN STANDING ON A BOX. RUDEST THING EVER I AM DEAD
Troops man please contact me, I want to collaborate
arteta in!
I think I know how to get us the winning mentality back, we have to come back in full capacity in our home stadium, get rid all of this covid...
This is good for Arsenal if we are not top 10, maybe this is the time for us to go to bottom league 🤣
Troopz does not respect Zah he would never snatch the mic from Robbie
Arteta is our leader, he will get us relegated, keep him stay for at least 5 years
If you smelllululululululll what The Troopz is cursing!
Oh Zah...I feel for you...its like an angry  lion about to devour a 🐁...Lord help zah before he gets eaten up🤣🤣🤣
Get Troopz in as manager blood lol jheez !! this mans so Shallow i can see straight through him when Arteta had recovered from testing positive for Covid 19  & Arsenal was doing well & Aubameyang was on fire it was like oh keep Arteta in 🤔. Troopz just simply pick up your toys & stop watching WWE it is what it is a true man knows you win some u lose some fcking Whallard 🤫 !! .. Bless up . ✌📿⚽️
Don't worry guys, Auba has previouses.
Big Man Ting needs a RKO
"WE ARE 15THPTH."
Troopz thinks he's so much bigger than he is 🤣🤣🤣
I like how Troopz is getting more views than AFTV
Someone tell Zah to stop saying mandem in that American accent
This is funny shit
my mum is “ARTETA IN!!!” is she mad?!?!...oh but relaxxxx the Rock...
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
This guy is so embarrassing 🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal fans should support Ozil situation n protest the management. It’s clearly shows that China is running Arsenal in Ozil situation.on future any arsenal may speak about China repression towards Tibet and Muslim they might get fired. So don’t make arsenal a communist team

Troopz was bout to spear man dem
Please relegates idiots
Troopz scares him so much 😂
Troops is a bully who knows Jack shit about football
I thought the interviewer slamp the head after he snatch microfon
You sound like an idiot troopz. Answers Zah question head on, stop beating around the bush.
This is put on massively
Troopz just fluctuates like a fecking voltmeter 2019 December - Wants Carlo Ancelotti 2020 July - My man Artekkers Now - I DoNt BeLiEvE iN aRtEtA
talking about who we are gonna bring in when we are 15th but why would a world class manager come to arsenal lol
Little guy has more sense that the troops the liar.
To be honest the players are playing shite because of you supporters
8:40 "We're 15th you ****ing walad!" 😭😭
Chief Keef 😂
Troopz is a true Arsenal fan who knows his history.You don’t have to like his expressions but he talks from the heart
Why does troops look like he wants to swing for this lil midgit
Money fixes everything! Man City once upon a time bottom of the league then money changed all that. The whole game is now about money
accg. to latest reports arteta to be given ultimatum for next 5 games or else face sack
You cant take the mic out of zahs hand like that 😭😭😭
#ZAHOUT 🤣😭
TROOPZ IS GNA DAMAGE THIS GUY SOON😂😂😂
Arteta is not the problem! Jose experienced this phase in his career, the problem is attacks from media, fans and pressure from the top!
Man could never snatch the mic from me like that ....friend or no friend im swinging are u mad
Since we cannot change ownership...We need to get help from Josh now. We need World class players and leaders and a coach who is experienced. Like Allegri...We have become a poison chalice I am afraid. Big changes are needed on the coaching side and player side...
Arteta has lost the players even if they are not good enough,he is not getting the best out of them alienating players like guendouzi, saliba and ozil
The next Claude and Ty
“WERE 15TH YOU FUCKING WALLAD”😭😭
troopz really went to America to find someone smaller than him for interviews
https://youtu.be/HMUZ0INHKIU Attitude havana
Brendan Rodgers is a top manager and gets laughed at because of the "proud", "character", "beautiful human being" caricature / Liverpool bottling the league. He used Celtic as a stepping stone to the EPL and is using Leicester as a stepping stone to a bigger club. Rodgers will be at Arsenal next season and Pochettino will be at United.
Is it me or does Don Robbie look a bit different here?
When the mic gets snatched from your hands, it's all games of thrones from there onward.
Omg you you guys just drew benfica. Fucking rip
Pure comedy gold 🤣
ARE U FUHKIN DELUDED?
Zah don’t let troopz take that mic from you
Zah is an idiot. Money alone doesn't fix things. The team needs a culture shift more than any personel change.
We wouldn't be here If wenger was in charge, but hey you wanted him out, I remember you complaining about being top 4!!!  YOU GET ME FAM!!!!!!!!!!!
I dont even watch football but this gives me anxiety
Who is this guy getting mugged off by Troopz and he's still standing there holding the mic? Never seen so much disrespect in a long while.
Free OZIL! Arteta out.
The Office and WWE = TroopzTV
Lol
Troopz you need another british Arsenal fan these yanks ain't shit
Toops!! I've always back you, love the trust the way you access a game... Arteta is f**king useless... Remember DT said he is back this guy is a total disgrace. You made mention of Alegri, poch even henry is available and more experienced than this guy. No pattern of no game plan....

This is more wwe then aftv
Commentator: “Troopz off the top rope”
Troopz only said “blud” 1 time smh and not a single “fam”
Prime Troopz vibes are back
WWE Armageddon: Booker T vs Samoa Joe
I love Troop reaction out there... Arteta out because he gat nothing to prove.
I stand by my brudda Aubabludclotfam. Cuz he give me da shoutout on da insta you get me fam? Blud what has Bellerin ever done fam? All he ever done is talk shit about us fans and den, AND DEN not know how to throw da ball  - Troopz / AFTV
That part when he said artera in trust the process the way he said had me crying dwl
Omg this man had me on the floor laughing and crying dwl I've never laugh like this before the man said who the fuck is going to sign 🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal are winning the championship next season 👏🏽
Nah man he just called him walad naaaaah
Watching from Kenya 🇰🇪 +254 Ebu likes za Kenya hapa👍
Troopz is makin my man cry chill
Speak english...  'madden'  what.....
0:50 why did he pan down... violated the presenter
I got a small hint that this coach might be bullshit when he signed David Luiz from us. I confirmed it when he again signed Willian from us 🤣.. #KTBFFH 💙
In Jan arsenal should go for lamptey and duffy or white plus that Salzburg midfielder
That microfon grab was epic :D
This short guy I would have slapped his face........ You can't create excuses for arteta.
When he mocked him saying “Arteta in trust the process” I was dead😭🤣😂💀
Ozil is better than all midfielders combined
Wow you told ole is PE teacher when you won against man utd ,now you are telling arteta is PE teacher     Banter fc 😂 😂 Fucking assholes
You fcking walled 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz i thought you were gonna drop him 🤣🤣🤣
bro like the thing is other big managers were available these man pick peps cone boy LMAO bro get him out and certain players
Wait is troopz still in the US??
This is terrible
Beyond a joke blud 😂😂😂😂
Yo when he snatched the microphone 😂 😂
This is troops tv rest are irrelevant tbh
Edu keeps backing arteta ...both should be fired asap  to save arsenal from being a mediocre club or even worse relegated
Bring back Mateo Goundezi
Grap his neck 😂😂😂
Arsenal are going down lol
Arteta in, everyone is fucking deluded if they think anyone else can do better with this team. Talking about relegation is beyond fucking stupid, a few results go our way and we're top half. To think an American is talking more sense than a London born Arsenal fan is fucking mad,
If troopz stole the mic from Robbie he would get slapped up
What happened to Rob?
Robbie would never let Troopz steal the mic like that. Come back to aftv troopz
But money is evrything tbh
This man thinks he knows better than Arteta but is asking for Mesut Ozil,  GTFOH
we're like the dead ting in a rave - Troopz, Dec. 2020
Please treat zar well. He didn't deserve that!
Ohhh God i am waiting for arsenal to God into relegation zone
Next 3 games they could actually lose
Not even a soccer fan, but this guy gets me fired up
I think now the best Edu can do is to get Alegri on board, so he can persuade Aouar to come over
My guy shouting big man ting to a dwarf💀💀💀💀
As a wise man once said  ‘ITS TIME TO GOOOOO!!!’
We r so close to witnessing a rock bottom
There are two things that are short in this video. The other is troopz temper
This dwarf Ty lol
I like troopz but that's bullshit
This man is so tiny he can’t barely reach the top 10 of the table too
This US Donny just said “mandem”
Troopz speaking truth. AC Milan is definitely the favor to take Europa and Arsenal is very likely to get relegated. After that, who the hell gonna wanna sign with Arsenal?
You know the teams bad when even aubameyang is not scoring.
Lost to Burnley 🤣🤣🤣, 💩 💩  Shit Arsenal.
Why did they show him on the box like we thought he was that tall smh
When he snatched the mic, was like a WWE promo
Troopz nah blood don’t do that to the man he look so scared..
New if anyone would like to watch or support :) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zpaxJnvvWcs
The camera man dirty looking down
Can’t blame arteta when the same players that have failed 2 managers (and are now failing him) are still in the club. Bellerin is the only questionable player you can criticise him for picking, but he must have his reasons.
Yhh troopz love how u deal wid dis ediot
Look at him trying to grab the mic back. Thank god he's wearing dark pants
My man sold out for this shit?
Hold the fucking camera still ffs or get a tripod
There is something unintentionally hilarious about this.
You can tell troopz been told to go all out
9:17 onwards 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Holy shit this is mad 😭😭😭
Cameraman needs to stop moving, stay in one position
2:30 like watching WWE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why does this look like a fake backstage argument in wwe
Troops shouting at that poor fella like he's Arteta. He'd be a nightmare to have a pint with.
Idiot arsenal fans always blaming the manager. Look at your squad, nowhere good enough. This is all about just putting the blame somewhere and easiest way out is to put it on Arteta. What is gonna happen with a new manager? He is magically gonna turn it around?
Troops about to turn Heel
WE NEED OZIL BACK. WE NEED THE CREATIVITY HE HAD WITH RONALDO BACK AT REAL MADRID "Blud"
Was expecting vince mcmahon to step inbetween these two... also what's with the NECESSARY box shot? 🤔
its funny to see the english act hard they just sound like absolute fannys having a stroke dude in white shitted himself can he even english *yawn*
Troopz needs a lesson in respect
Bloody hell Robbie has gone down hill since lock down 😂😂😂
Mi bredda T real talk Arteta out. Arteta don't know talent, and he is holding back good players.
Seems like these guys at Bar stool are slightly misunderstanding the culture. Everything in America is built off of hype, Troopz needs to be careful that they don't turn him into some type of Minstrel show. They've got him up there with a vertically challenged person, making for some strange visuals. No disrespect to Zah,, he's a good brother but he's gotta be careful they don't exploit him too. The presentation and the imaging looking  kinda funky right now, not gonna lie, come like pantomime. That said, no disrespect, I wish these guys the best. But don't let them exploit the culture, as if to say you're some clown performing to the crowd for a penny.
Troopz is getting far too big for his boots. He would have never snatched the mic off Robbie.  This American thing doesn't suit him or his energy.
yah...speak the truth @Troopz! don let em silence u! shoutout to @Zimbo.
Tbf, the ozil situation is actually not Arteta’s fault. Blame China and politics
Nobody: Zah: kids and all that shit
arteta has no clue, he is fullly of shitt.
Short man is top class 👌👌👌
Troops just violated him man you can’t treat a 10 year old like that poor kid
This was like a WWE interview
Robbie crying he not getting a new  porsche by not getting this interview
It's not Ty, but his American cousin.
Somewhere Wenger is rolling about pissing himself the gooners have gone from cl every season to making up the numbers with everton
you will see. arteta is the guy
Warnock in.
Aubame me, Aubame you, Aubame who? AUBAME BLOODCLAAT YANG BLOOD! YOU GET ME FAM! 😡😡🤬🤬
🤣🤣🤣the comment section as nothing to say about arsenal.  Its all about these 2
The Ozil situation is dead simple this guy fucked with the money talking about the Uygur muslims in China! Hence why they made him an excample  and also he kinda lazy with defending, back tracking, actually running in general is his weakness!
Bruh this looks like all the backroom call outs to promote Wrestlemania 😂😂😂
Artea out 😂 absolute idiots .. couldn’t happen (being in bad form at 15th) to a better club
God help Zah if Arsenal lose again this week. Troopz will knock him right off that stool.
Oi this dude is no, Don Robbie!
I watched this like 10 times now. Favourite moment  best moment starts here 2:27
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You wanted wenger out , you wanted emery out now what.
Lmao arsenal fans always so angry  , I feel your pain arsenal fans 😂 you guys just have so much bad luck
Get troops to give the pre match pep talk
Bruh, don’t take mans mike. I don’t know who’s interview it is. 😅😂
Is that gervinho?
They compared this Tony pulis with head and shoulders shampoo to Frank lampard 😭😭😭

Troopz needs to get a replica WWE Heavyweight Belt to hold over his shoulder during these interviews 🤣
When Americans use British slang 😂😂
Troopz calm down
Mini Ty will be off soon. My man was lucky to get out of that interview alive  🤣
Sorry men. I think you are not good enough. Football makes players rich. And you get mad for nothing. Stupid
0:49 camera man taking the piss here😂😂😭😭
When that Fulham result came in I shit it 🤣🤣🤣🤣 from what to what! Wenger in Blud
"Trust The Process" ✊
Ι'm not an arsenal fan but westsood literally pushed him on the floor that's why xhaka grabbed him by the neck
That was a WWE cringe fest.😬
I was waiting for an R.K.O.. .. from nowhere!
For once, I agree with troopz, but I think the way he spoke to American Robbie was a bit disrespectful. But if he's okay with it, who am I to comment? But bare respect for calling out Liverpool as the best team in the league, though we sure ain't showing it and I think man city still is the team to fear, despite them being 8th. Anyway, nice jumpmans
0:50 violatinggggg
Where’s randy orton
Take it easy on Zah man, he doesn’t deserve to be a fuckin wallad just Bc he’s delusional and belies in arteta.
Ill tell you the truth. Zah never watched football when Arsenal were a great side.
Troopz my G u need to come back to aftv!
COME HOME TROOPZ. THESE YANKS ARE BORINGGGG! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
No one can compare to the almighty Ty
DON Robbie if you chopped his legs off.
This geezer sounds a bit like Kevin Hart 🤣
All these man look like they need a bath and a trim
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal have been relegated before, some time in the early 1900s
WWE style interview had me in tears of laughter, imagine actually losing the next game, I fear for Zah's life if that comes to pass. 😂😂😂😂😂
The problem that arsenal have, it is not one person that caused it and it is not one person that will solve it
Troopz is deluded We're neither creating nor scoring and you're talking about Saliba?!
You know troopz is going crazy with anger. Man said i want big sam.
Im so glad this guy has left AFTV.
Troopz got a point
Troopz not holding back on Zah 😂😂😂😂
3:34 ARTETA IN 😂😂😂😂
Feel sad for zah tbh 😂💔
Lies, Arsenal have been relegated 1912 - 1913 season
Sah speaks facts . Troopz is a clown
Fucking wallad zah
Sod AFTV, this is where it's at. I'm buying the next PPV on this channel because it's gonna be bigger than Joshua vs. Fury!
Troop out now. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Im a chelsea fan but xhaka is not a good player
Troopz is bare pissed fam.. i feel your pain bro 😪
Ty shrunk
This is the funniest thing I've seen in a while 😂😂😂
Its both
Anyone watching this again 😂😂😂😂
Stick with the Europa team,they score goals
Its the players .trust .
Bellerin actually made some great crosses just a few games ago. Troopz just can’t handle the rebuild.
Ozil is the best midfielder in the world arteta 😡
TTV AND CHILL
By players
this was absolutely funny
Arteta change now but players bring Ozil if u don’t we are rRelegated
How Özil and Saliba ain’t getting no playing is messing with my head fr
I really hope this dead team continues the same way 🙏  Arteta in 🤣 Troopz ya little muppet
Arteta out
toxic fans
Lmao bad acting not the same as AFTV seems so non genuine
Troopz is so fake
Need to watch this again, missed if Arsenal are 15th or not...I’m sure they mention it
In frank Lampard first season he had a transfer ban and still managed to do better then arteta with a bunch of kids 😂😂😂 Arsenal fans the gift that keeps on giving
Money is key with players they dont care where club is you offer a player double his wages and the time is in 15th he will sign 100%
Troopz soon become a wrestler
Imagine this guy and Ty arguing
This is my new favourite show. 🤯
Look what arsenal did to Don robbie
"YOU FUCKING WALLAD" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Troops is an OG
Old man troopet better hold it down before racist police shoot his clart 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😜
I am sharing all my application
To be fair tho that Burnley game did change on that Xhaka red card. In isolation that result isn't really at Artetas feet
I think we just needs to sell xhaka and get another midfielder
Sad
What has the little guy done to get so much abuse... ??? hahahahaha
Instead of walk for weed you went to Hollywood.  Vince McMahon gonna smash Zach arse...... keep it real
This is hilarious troopz
Ty's American cousin, delusion runs in the family.
I like the duo good chemistry
2:31😂🤣🤣🤣🤣I cant breathe
WE'RE 15TH YOU FUCKING WALLAD
Wenger in!
WengerOut, EmeryOut, ArtetaOut, NextCoachNameOut
Arsenal wouldn’t match up well in the bottom of the Championship. Too many young, careless players with talent being led by veteran average-talent that lack leadership. Good luck in the Championship.
Bruh the troopz taking the mic out of his hand by force got me weak af London is always blue go Chelsea
Troops and dt are spot on about Bellerin , he is dreadful
Still back Arteta 100%!!!  Weak pussy players who can’t stay motivated and no investment from the ownership.
This camera is brighter than my future
The new lamborghini ESSENZA SCV12 awesome luxury car  https://youtu.be/l7vn_dZTEUM Welcome dear 💯
Lmao . So troops gone to USA for another ty
Troopz is stealing Robbie's views
Agree with Troopz Ozil is so much better than some of Arsenal first teamers
I was half expecting Stonecold Steve Austin to come running in with a JR voiceover after Troopz started ranting about Bellerin
Nahhh 😂🤣 I hope this isn’t serious...this is embarrassing af
0:50 what jeans is troopz wearing??
this seems so staged and fake. the way troopz talks and the other guy, the way he acts just everything
These Americans must be looking at troopz like he's mad🤣 Yeah bro Soccer be like that. Have you rattled with emotions 🥴... Troopz relax, health care ain't free out there bro, high blood  pressure fam.
🤣🤣🤣
Who was scared Troopz might get so angry he might hit the other guy by accident or push😂😂😂
American Ty 🤣😂
I'm a spurs fan. I come here to laugh
LOL I have  MISSED this meltdowns!
These Americans just don’t have that passion lol I mean if you just see Troopz‘s passion towards Arsenal compared to theirs...
Americans don’t want our smoke
Ozil situation = He spoke out against China's treatment of the Uyghir population. Chinese sponsors demanded he be punished.
Yo I beg you do wwe match
Er social distance troops
You can take Troopz out of AFTV but you can’t get the AFTV out of Troopz
As a Chelsea fan im soo happy
10yearold troopzzzz backagain!
this isnt Covid safe lol...  Another man talk to me in that tone ?  problems ! #facts
I don't like this guy his so fake his trying to show  passion as football fans his just acting and  the way he talks is so annoying it was so disrespect to the the guy he was interviewed him
Troops let the man speak ffs!
What happened to robbie??
The way how troops was standing with the mic was funny😂😂😂 It was like he was gonna spank the guy out😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man said "Were the dead ting in the rave"
Troopz wrong. Arteta not the problem, the players are serial duds.
Where u find this guy from blud
America ain’t ready for Troopz 😂😂😂
And they think Emery was the problem 😂😂😂😂 look at them ranting.
Aubameyang be like.. Just want to let you know, I'm trying to find out if I can un-sign da ting!
Arsenal might as well sign championship players
Ayy bruv Sign me up arsenal
Arsenal could be the greatest gift for football fans 😂😂😂😂😂
If arsenal gets relegated and then wins Europa... that means for the first time a championship team would qualify for champions league that would be an achievement for arsenal fans
👇NEW COLD 🥶 DJ TUNE 👇 https://youtu.be/GSiYjwZpaJs
Has troopz left arsenal fan tv?
Nah shorty, you can see that signing players isnt even the answer. This is something deep rooted, so this is a Gods of the club type situation, thats how the air will be cleared.
Been watching every week to see the episode where the midgit falls of the stool ... 1 day it will happen 1 day ...
Troops is real if he says arteta out this guys was peps water boy and whoever thought from the get go this guy was gonna take them somewhere u lot are clowns im a Liverpool fan by the way so glad u lot didn't get Ancelotti
He went to America to be his own AFTV
"This ain't very COVID friendly guys" - CraigRussellChugg
Thank you for winding him up!!!!
I was waiting for Kane to come around the corner and I ain’t mean Harry Kane
They need to have Claude on as a guest appearance
spurs fan here.  this was hilarious.
It is clear that Troopz and DT should be appointed as the next managers of Arsenal (co-managers)... But Arsenal need to hurry otherwise the Americans may swoop in and offer them big money contracts to replace boring people like Oprah Winfrey or Ellen Degeneres.

Troopz back up a little man. I feel sorry for this little dude 😅
I guess Solskjaer aint that bad...
Arsenal OUT! Wait what?
Arsenal fans still expecting miracles when we Have xhaka, bellerin, willian as our starters.. we can Change managers every game but with some of these players, there will be no change... let Arteta have his rebuild. we have been shite for years now anyway
The camera man has to leave doing dirty to my body zah
Straight Up Comedy. You fucking Wallad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Acting period,embarassing.  You are turning into an American all actors.
As a Tottenham fan I kinda feel sorry for Arsenal and plus i wanted Arsenal to win that game and now they fucked it up
Men the first gye that talked mennnnnnn Coool Doooownnnnn boyy
STFU. You gonna be the next manager
Partey just left UCL for relegation! Hahaha, also, while a bit hammy, this is the kind of content I want from @AFTV and Hugh Wizzy. They've mellowed out too much 😂😂😂
Ozil in Now or Else all is lost .
2:31 Troopz basically going Attitude era Rock and telling  Zah to “Know his role and shut his mouth” LMAO
Veganism ruined Hector Bellerin. Cautionary tale for all athletes.
Mini Robbie 😂😂 #COYS💙
3:00 Look at him tryna reply to Troopz
It’s time to goo arteta ~ 2020
Arteta, is too emotional. He should give Pep and Wenga a call. He is completely blind and can’t see his problem.
This is art well done to both of them
This is not an interview this is bullying
Sam allardyce is good
Can troopz become a manager please
Cameraman thinks he's shooting Jack Bauer having a dramatic conversation. Constant snap zooms, shakey cam, and horizontal drifts. 🤣 Buy a tripod and use a fixed shot, lads. It's cheaper, and infinitely more suited to this kind of content.
What player will leave a team in CL or Europa league for a team in a relegation battle. Partey did. And technically Kante did it too. We were down to 15th at some time and finished 10th, but we still got him signed for us. BTW it was the same summer Xhaka signed for Arsenal.
If The Rock and Michael Cole were Arsenal fans in the Attitude Era
Making money from outrage. 2020.
Im a Chelsea fan but wven i know that Ozil is a great playmaker
TROOPZ:- olle and lampard are shit managers....we got "ARTEKKERS"..... 3 MONTHS LATER TROOPZ:- ARTETA IS SHIT   I DONT BELIEVE IN ARTETA....ARTETA OUT!!!
Play ozil
The black Tyrion Lannister
i was seriously becoming concerned for thebespectacled guys well bing at one  point. arsenal fans are certainly "invested" in their team
Shit i was like dude troops is too short, then the camera man explained why
And I didn't think there was anyone more deluded than ty 🤦‍♂️
Arsenal football club RIP
ARTETA OUT
Arteta in!
People saying they feel for Arsenal una, I I don't feel a single ounce of pity, they are loud as fuck
Bring back ozil see what’s it like
Troopz all day
Troops looks like he might eat that guy. Good lord.
What in the. WWE shit is this 😂
0:50 😂😂😂
I cringed at 2:58 when Troopz shouted "big man ting"... 😬
This is how you know Americans don't know anything about football in Europe, only in the MLS would money make big players come to a struggling club 😂
How can he grab the mic like that 😭😭😭😭😭
Hyperbolic screeching framed as critique. Hasn't the world has enough of this in recent years? Awful clickbait which only seeks to harm and push out any reasonable discourse that could occur in this space.
2:32.... Gets me every time... Lol
This is comedy class! Soon Arsenal fan TV will have the most subscribers on YouTube. Loving this
15th counter here  👇
Arteta is a fraud. I agree with Troopz, we can't trust the process any more. That process is relegating us. Arteta Out
At 2:58 im surprised the PC brigade are not all over that yet🤣🤣🤣
Booker T and The Rock 2001 Backstage interview right here
Big Sam for the win
This is so fabricated man. I don’t doubt how much Troopz cares but it’s slightly bizarre how staged this is which runs contrary to any passion. I feel like it’s more of a comedy skit now whereas Robbie, whatever you think about the guy clearly cares about arsenal and matches passion with the people he interviews.
I'm just waiting for Josh Kroenke to announce that Arteta is sacked. Arsenal is bigger than him so he has no right to be too authoritative. The players are very unwilling to deliver. He should stop deceiving us. We are suffering here
Oh partey 😭
Troopz with the clean aj1 mids
😂😂 stop he's already dead
Troopz is right. I believe we should have had Ancelloti. Arsenal are not serious.  I dont watch this team no more. Pointless
Arsenal fans are fighting each other now 😂
Banter club 😂
Troopz needs to realise how stupid he sounds a few months ago when we won the fa cup he said " we dont have a p.e teacher we have a manager klopp smoke lampard smoke proper bigging up arteta now its all going shit hes saying get him out 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Troopz knows deep down that he has got to come back to the UK to help his arsenal, he knows Auba respected him and took his passion direct to the team and pitch in love real time. Troopz knows
The camera man took the piss when he try bring the camera down on man stool 😂
0:50 🥶
0:50- the disrespect lol ahahahahahhahahahahhaha
DO A DAMN TRNSFER FOR ANCHELOTTI IF WE HAVE TO!
you fucking WALLAD ahahah i actually love that word
BGUPZ TROOPZ! ARTETA OUT =!
So if you have 25 dead players that means y’all are in a relegation battle.........
Half ounce of Ty
Seriously how old is troopz? Why does he still dress and talk like a ' roadman ' or whatever twats call themselves these days
Troopz didnt say a word and still had me FOLDED😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dead ting
Troopz thinks that being louder than someone makes him correct *face palm*
Big man ting 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Watch this video for extreme mind relaxing experience https://youtu.be/HIPdFTSWXAU 🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿
50 seconds in camera pans down to him on the block or whatever it was got me creasing 😂
Joke of a club 😂
American TY🤣🤣🤣
Zah got scared when troopz took the mike ,when he said big man ting zah starts looking around like its dig at him..
I’m a spurs fan and I love watching these weekly lol feels good
He was like Wtf is he saying i don't understand him 😂😂😂😂😂
Said for time xhaka has to go he is shit
Absolutely right Troopz.. Who is gonna come? Another fading star who is looking for his last big pay cheque for underperforming.... 😭
Stop scaring likkle man my g?
Troopz pippa & charline want u back & im a hammer⚒
loool Troopz took over the presenters job. He was shook hahaha
I'd know when he would take aladice because he will keep them up lol
Big Sam finishing off a chip butty rearing to go
I'll say this so troopz understands, he seems more deluded here no offense  acc to fabrizio romano arsenal is and will always be a big name in transfers where players would like to play (facts) about ozil situation, emery didnt play him, the guy is buzzing at la liga  arteta wont play him theres 3 managers who did not play him, so that says alot in itself lastly the squad is filled with deadwood, reason? fans like us settled for mediocrity.. half of these players are still playing since wenger era, willian probably is artetas mistake but previous managers made transfer mistakes too, wenger got alot of dead wood emery never got a say in transfer board got pepe who looks like a 30m signing.. the players are shit, yes arteta fucks it up but the players deserve the blame for most.. how are arsenal gonna ever achieve anything with switching managers where we overlook players who cant play, players who headbutt and choke? lastly, its the fans from aftv which also rated these players 7/10 8/10 for completely avg performances. we were gassing bellerin xhaka holding, and overlook the time they were shit.. and now since they cant hide behind their once in a while above avg performances now you guys see how shit they are? come on man.  zah has a point, the whole squad is dead.. the board is dead for not injecting money, fans are being flipflops arteta is lost with how long he can make castles with can scraps.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this ones better than aftv
Troopz give it big en after community shield saying how good Arteta was 😂😂 absolute clown just for views
It's football in UK and soccer in USA, see the difference 😂
Southampton will mash you lot up!
2:41   The guy on the left genuinely looked scared shitless!!
We NEED GUENDOUZI
Not Arteta out
U Wallad 😭😭
Arteta out , I don’t think it is the player, it is arteta no tactic no plan, I think he play  with  look, if you looky you wing that’s not the we you play, he has no plan A and B, he has no  idea, we don’t want waist anymore time he has to go,out 😡😡😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👏
This should be #1 trending on YouTube.
This looks so scripted and forced. Getting wwe vibes lmao
Guy with the white top probably looks at the ratings at the end of the game and wants everyone out😂
Ceballos literally is a way more effective footballer than ozil as of the last 3 years
Nah, the box 😭😭😭
Why hasn't he been sacked yet? Are they waiting for us to be bottom of the league before they do anything!! The fans who do go to the Southampton game need to be more vocal otherwise what's the point of going?
Troopz like The Rock snatching the mic of Kevin Kelly
So it’s not xhakas fault that he lashed out frustrated but it is artetas? Chatting shit
Your the biggest plastic fan going   You know fuck all about football
Troopz went from getting interviewed by Don Robbie to tinny man TY
This is actually hilarious lmfao
Wow them subs went up rapid 180k
WE ARE FUCKING FIFTEENTH!!!!!😂😂😂🤦🏿‍♂️
Who else waiting for Troopz to hit mans with a steel chair
Bro, this is straight WWE backstage brawl settings. I was waiting for the steel chair or 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire to make an appearance
I dont even wanna see dani there...giv ESR the position come on im upset giv auba a rest he does not want to 2 play
9:30 The moment Troops loses all faith in Zah
At least troopz isn’t deluded tho
I'm sure Troopz recently was all "Mikel Ar-Tek-Ers"?
Did that American dude just say “mandem”
DunDALLLLK 🥴🥴🥴
At least AFTV is real. This looks fake clearly 😂
When the camera man/women zooms to the box 🤣
Taking the microphone off the presenter sorry troopz but that’s disrespectful. No need to take it out him in him. Bad form
This is so jokes
This looks staged 😂
i spat water when the camera man panned the camera down and zah was standing on a stool xD
Troopz finally found someone smaller height then himself 😂
SALIBA AND GUENDOUZI SHOULD BE PLAYING, OZIL SHOULD BE GETTING SOME GAME TIME TOO. GET RID OF ARTETA NOW
Arteta OUT!
There were wenger out when they were getting top 4 consistently
Xhakka wanted to be off work for Xmas that’s all
It’s like troops telling his kid off hahah
Big man thing troopz he is the opposite bro
Zah cracks me up!
my mans face when he said arteta in is priceless
EY TELL HIM FAM, ARTETA IS A MUG, HE NEEDS TO GO NOW
My man troopz found a mini Robbie in US 😂
This is the real feeling of arsenal fan.
4 on trending finally the people understand how hilarious troops is 😂😂😂😂
0:52 they did my man dirty
Americans really know how to dramatise everything
Don't be surprised if the little man catches Covid-19 with all that shouting in his face.
I 100 percent agree with zah
big man ting i think he was vio
Zah needs to do more research, Arteta actually had more backing from the board than Emery and Wengers (last 3years),  +/- 8 players brought in by him.  (source lee)
Is it called barstool sports cuz that’s what the guy on the left has to stand on to interview anyone?
2:25 is the most I’ve laughed in a long time😂😂😂😂😂
I prefer watching this week in week out than watching the Team Play 🤣
This is soooo fucking funny oh my lord 😂😂😂😂
This feels like a kid getting screamed at and abused.  Someone call childline.
Troops raging!
ARTETA has got us to a level of deep crap. Current situation in EPL, we got good teams, bad teams, few load of shit & thn ARSENAL. D 'Wenger Out' gang must b regretting now. Is it better to fight for europa league or the relegation?!?!?
Get him on the pizza reviews
Aubameyang should of joined United or barca
Need to bring zah to aftv and let's see how ty reacts 😂
The legend troopz on it
Taking that mic ...How rude!
Interviewer is acting because DT said they are manipulating Troopz to sell "Arteta out" shirts
Auba is shit just admit it u jokeman
Stone Cold Steve Troopz over here.
Arsenal created 18 chances and lost because they conceded an own goal.. had 65% possession ... the red card affected the team.. can't blame the manager on this one .. if the game went 1-0 in arsenal favour none of the fans would be mad .
Lmao this is gold
Troopz face 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
Arsenal fans are killing me yooh🤣🤣🤣
Benfica will beat Arsenal
both squad and management need to change... Even the fan base... Arsenal needs complete overhaul
Why does this look like it's scripted lol
🤣🤣who is interview who here ..
Damn troopz moving like priti patel in the workplace
He really said big man ting uno
loser club
Not Arteta problem !!! Problems with all player's must have responsibility !!!
I just came here to see how sad it is how seriously some people take football. I was not disappointed.
He looks like KSI
How tall is he 143? 😂
I dont think this channel is safe for American Ty.
TroopzTV got an american version of TY
Bellerin was brilliant before he got injured
Cmon troopz, good luck to ya but your selling out man this seems so fake
Big man ting?😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
If I was vince Mcmahon I would hire troop as the replacement for paul heyman.
Zah is gonna need some windshield wipers moving forward. Troopz is gonna get worse.
Is this comedy? Lol
Troopz two words Corona virus.
😂😂😂😂😂I LOVE YOUR VIBE!
Troopz nailing it, experience speaks, the American Ty is deluded, he's been watching too much DT, regardless arteta's getting sacked in a few games, even arsenal's favourite journalists are annoying him.
This is a bit cheesy troopz
Ksi pissed
All this for views 😂 nah bruh man
I love you troopz but your chatting crap if you want Arteta out already.
Money DOES attract rats...like Partey
Troopz moved to America to run into their version of Ty. Equally as deluded as the original.
Fuck off man. Arteta out? Seriously? What happens if Arteta goes? We bring in a new manager. He has a honeymoon period, we might win the FA Cup. The we have a bad start, team isnt playing well. We are bottom half. Manager sacked again. Process repeats, over and over again. Kroenke is the problem. If he was investing we would be fine. Fuck Off.
Little Ty interviewing Troopz
This is just jokes 🤣🤣🤣
This is just jokes 🤣🤣🤣
If arsenal actually gets relegated that would be crazy af 😂
15
Troopz talking to a wall.. Troppz, people like Zah don’t understand the dynamics of football. He doesn’t understand when you say money can’t save this club. He doesn’t know that most players play for glory and not money. Troopz you are 100% correct but don’t waste your time on people that don’t understand how football works.
I told Arsenal fans after they got a lucky draw against Liverpool don't gas its early days.   Asenal fans were hyping not long ago.  Imagine  Arsenal had injuries Liverpool had
The Europeans showing the Americans how things are done in the old country. Its like in Demolition Man  "Put down the mic ... or else...."
This ompa dudes got to be Ty's DNA line somewhere. Interviewing someone doesn't involve you hogging up the mic with your deluded opinions
“Nice” NAH YOU ARE SHIT! YOUR MANAGER? SHIT! YEAH? WHERE YOU MAN AT? 15th? 16th? This man, literally, wake up every weekend praying! West Brom, Fulham, Sheffield United, LOOSE!   So glad he loves 15th a the words “you are shit” cause arsenal are both now 😍😍 https://twitter.com/thefergusonway/status/1338425029529243648?s=21
Was Troopz trolling when he said "big man ting"
There was like 5 ads in this video! With all the money aftv making of YouTube ads and views pretty soon they can buy of the club 😂 and get who ever they want player or manager. Make that happen. Robbie next owner, troopz manager, ty the club psychologist.
Funny thing is Arsenal is so similar to Man Utd last season. They were in the bottom half/mid table for half the season missing a creative number 10 (like Arsenal do), they bought Fernandes and everything changed, they finished 3rd. Everyone wanted Ole out too (some still do). Point is United coughed up the money and got their man in the January transfer window, Arsenal can do the same but problem is will they.
No one can return the team to the right path in this period except Arsen Wenger. He is the only one who knows the club’s secrets and can deal with young and experienced players.  At least we were playing attacking football despite the bad performance in his last season with the team
If Arteta is not responsible for our performance this season, then similarly he is not responsible for our FA Cup win
why can't they have 2 mics?
Haven't watched this yet but this look like some WWE shit
Brothers, we used to play with Dennelson, Song, Abu Bandar, Chamakh, and Dusantus, and we used to play a sweet ball, imagining how bad we were.
Bro if you tired you can support  DC united.......your point z fucking point less cos u the same fool praising Arteta back den
This is just uncomfortable. Troopz is an absolute mug.
The only thing attractive about arsenal is the merch
Get rid of this b-Tec Hornswoggle
THEY HAVE RE PLANTED THIER OWN NEW STRAIN OF FLU IN LONDON TO LEGITIMISE THEIR SCAMDEMIC,  ELITES ARE PANICKING
The cameraman just violated the short guy😅😅😅😅😅
Troopz took that mic like he took this boys lunch money
Feel bad for him 😂
This is why Americans should stick to the NFL
In Wenger we trust
Mini Booker T
Nahhhh the second “with your chest” killed me 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
Arteta IN
Talking over your co-host, insulting him, forcefully grabbing the mic, shouting in his face. Real class act you are.
i miss arsnal nt this sheets
Arsenal is shit.🤣🤣🗑💀 ✌️ to being in the top 6. You guys are fighting to not go in the relegation zone now in the bottom 6.
😒
Use your head ya fuckin wallad LMAOOOO
Much contrast to the aftv man u interview
Zah is not American. His from Zimbabwe...
Troops makes me laugh every time 😂😂😂
Troopz getting trolled on his own channel  😂
The way he takes the mic out of his hand, "we're fucking 15th!!!!" 😂😂
Troopz I have to agree with you zah your chatting
Why ain’t troopz on aftv
Cant wait what troopz does to zah when arsenal loses to Southampton and he says "Arteta in still."
I am a Chelsea fan that loves Troopz complaining about his team , absolute gold fam
how is this short thing
Arsenal has their self to blame cause u cannot possibly have ozil on the squad shit
Troopz stop bullying Zah. 🤣
Dwayne Troooz Johnson
I think arsenal need a English manager
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
How did William get there do quick
Whattt!!!  Whattt!!!  Whattt!! 😂
i guarantee Arsenal change the manager and you’ll get the same results! they need to get rid of the dead wood who have consistently let the club down for the last couple of seasons and replace them with players who want to be there and fight for the shirt. i’m not even an arsenal fan i just consistently see the same players letting the club down no matter who’s in charge. Kroenke needs to back the manager and get rid of players like bellerin, xaka, lacazette etc and replace them with players who the young lads coming through can learn from
At least Arsenal playing UEL now but Lyon didn't play in Europe competition this season
Big man ting lol
The interviewee needs his own mic cos Troopz is a microphone bully 😂😂😂
Take your time with it! Take your time with it!
Same guy that said arteta is better than lampard🤣🤣🤣 Look @ you now
Only thing missing is wwe logo .
I say let’s just fuck it and get pochettino 😂
How is Troopz saying  ‘Big man ting’ to him 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz should be WWEs next manager next to a big superstar lol
'Low sayin' "BIG MAN TING!!!!" To a dwarf.
Robbie & AFTV needs to step up their production 🤣
He has previouses!
THIS IS WWE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...NO MORE FOOTBALL....I’M SCARED TROOPZ CAN PUNCH THIS GUY TO DEATH...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like the other guy his energy is calm; why did Troopz do him like that 😂
I don’t get why maitland niles is never playing now ? He was better then bellerin and got an England call up but it’s shit
This video is simply great content  So weird, so funny
I'm waiting for Zah to blame the length of the grass
Mini Robbie XD XD XD XD likable guy
Zah is confused.   Arteta pushed for these dead signings. He's freezing out players that should be playing or at least in the rotation. Guendizzle, Saliba, Ozil.  Why is he still backing Xhaka and Elneny, Bellerin cant throw a football and he was defending the guy.   Wenger was dealing with dead squad after dead squad with barely any financial backing and was still getting 4th each year.  How can a team go from be so creative, to creating less chances than most of the bottom teams in Europe?  This is systemic fault at Arsenal but we've always known this. Arteta should be doing better with what he currently has period.
Is this suppose to be a parody of Robbie and DT?
Profiting from choreographed wwe stylee dramatic slagging off of our club. Do me a favour
robbie lost in space 😂 https://youtu.be/iTb-cabGwds
self entitled fans think they're big time. Barely done anything for years, barely won anything when you lot where "good". Never touched a European trophy, maybe just dial back your expectations. You lot cry more than Man U fans do but atleast Man U have a rich history of winning trophies.
Use your head you fvcking Wallad!! 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Arteta in otherwise same group of players have got rid of 3 managers due to their SHIT play. They need to step up.
I told my brother, we losing today. He didn't believe me. #Arsenalgetrelegated
If the following team isn't given a run-out starting on Wednesday and for the foreseeable future then it's time to say bye bye Arteta. Either grow a spine or leave if you don't have the balls to step up. Leno Cedric, Saliba, Gabriel, Tierney AMN, Partey (Elneny till Partey returns from his injury) Pepe, ESR, Saka Balogun Impact subs: Nelson, Martinelli I don't want to see Xhaka, Willian, Bellerin start for this team again how many more seasons are we gonna see the same old cr@p. Over Jan and the summer get rid of Bellerin, Luiz, Mustafi, Holding, Chambers, Sokratis, Cedric, Kolasinac, Xhaka, Dani, Elneny, Willian, Ozil, and Laccazette. Loan out Eddie and Willock.
I can’t take none of these videos seriously 😂😂😂😂
EDU is fishy!
I know absolutely nada about futbol but these two are electric😂 very thankful I was exposed to Troopz thru Barstool✊🏻
Nah the way he grabbed the mic was giving me The Rock vibes 😂😂😂😂
Troops share the mike.... I understand you want to stress a point but be fair.
Things are getting very intense on the forrest moon of Endor
Use this energy towards KROENKE!!!
One day, Troopz will kick that stool from right under the interviewer out of frustration.
As a Man Utd fan, can I say I love this. It’s the funniest thing. I actually enjoy seeing Arsenal lose more than Liverpool
Troopz unleashed loool. Enjoy 15th, Waking and praying Fulham, Burnley and West Brom lose: your COMPETITION.
Troopz, why are you there? Just go back to AFTV
deluded Troopz.  trust the process (Arteta in) who can do better with  the same squad
The camera guy just had to pan down 😂
Troopz said “big man ting” to a little man.
Arsenal played a 4-5-1 defensive formation at home to Burnley a team they've never lost to in the PL.... Hahahaha.
He has to grow blud
To be fair there does seem like a light at end of the tunnel..... A speeding train approaching! 😂
I am Troopz. Troopz is me right now! 😔🤬🤬🤬😡
The best of Troopz TV
Troopz said it wasn't that bad in Wenger and Emery's time but he wanted them out, it is pride that is destroying Arsenal football club
Arsenal coach is very stupid we need ozil back ozil is de solution of arsenal call him back
Hahhaha.. Guys yu are killing even me in Belgrade 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️  Troops will kill this guy when yu lose next time (next week 😂😂🤦‍♂️)
I think man drunk over 😂😂😂
We are too Auba dependent and we are seeing now that since he’s not scoring we aren’t winning games he’s the only one who can put the ball in the net constantly and I feel like he needs better service and hopefully when martenelli gets back on the squad he can help with crosses and goals
Troops you don't act as if you are the only Arsenal Fan the club has.  It does not always work changing manager all the time.
Stick that in your pipe bully boy,  you are in a relegation battle mug 🤣😂🤣😂
When troopz took the mic from 2:31 it looked like he was tellin off his son for bunking off school 🤣🤣
WTF. I half expected Bam Bam Bigalow to come through the door in a Tottenham shirt haha.
I love how u still do interviews even tho u ain’t on AFTV
Troopz will do anything for the views..cant blame him lol this is so staged
THE CAMERA MAN MOCKED IT 0:50🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comedy gold 🤣
What accent does Troopz have? Jafaican or some shit?
So a new manager is going and come in and magically make this team good?
Bit cheeky panning down to the box that matey boy is standing on.
Troopz don’t deserve to be here hahah needs to be back in NL
Ha ha ha happy days another manager yous are hounding out
The way troopz is talking saying he is your manager I mean they both support Arsenal right 😂😂
Why is he scolding the little guy, what he do wrong?😂
troopz, stop abusing your pal. he's done nothing.
Lol embarrassingly staged WWE shit ....bring out the chair
Man I like Troopz and the video is amazingly funny, but my god does this come off as fake 😂 seen a comment saying it’s like WWE, i think this is top notch promo work here 😂
Go back to AFTV
Why pan the camera at 0.48 😂😂😂😂
😂😂 Troopz should be in MMA.
This looks so staged LOL
I refuse to believe that this was a real interview. No way this was real. This has to be a skit. It's gotta be a skit.
You guys are the realest
This is the tried and tested method good cop bad cop, one person argues for Mikel Arteta, and the other against Arteta. This is just embarrassing, all these podcasts that are doing this is a humiliation to all real Arsenal supporters, this is profit over Arsenal!
Leave the poor guy alone mate
Aouar doesn't have European football lol
Remember when you beat “Dundalk” and thought you’s were back on form! 😂😂  Championship club at best now...delusional.
Arteta shouldn’t pick the wastemen then .  No excuse for picking players that aren’t good enough lil man
3:00 how can Troopz say ‘big man ting’ 🤔
I agree with troopz 100 percent arteta is shit
All I hear is Shona
There's more views than subscribers, why?  You like the thing, subscribe to it!
With your Chest 😂😂
Been over there 10 minutes.. That microphone grab though! Wow
The pain we are going through now is very terrible..are players boycotting to bring  Ozil back
After Ozil situation everything changed..... I feel the players supports him and wanted him in the team
dude, this guy dosent know football... (not Troopz)
Manage your expectations, arsenal are shit right now.Arsenal are not going down thou. It's much Arteta fault as the players. Sacking Arteta now will only hurt Arsenal. New manager mean getting new players and restart of the process. Tell me what can Alegri do with this team?? We need to ride this hurt WITH Arteta give him a chance to get rid of all the shit players like Bellerin, Papa, Ozil, Shaka, Holding and Lacazet
Trust the process lads and you'll all be rich beyond your wildest dreams when Arsenal get relegated
Your gonna need Sam Allardyce to keep you up 🤣🤣
Troopz and his love child need to chill
Social distancing gone through the window...
Troopz has got pretty annoying since he's joined barstool. constantly talking over zah. he's become so condescending as well - think im done with him likes hes done with arteta
Pick on someone your own size fam
Cedric for Bellerin? Yeah that definitely makes Arsenal a top 6 contender!
Why the canera man did Za like that in the beginning 😂
Arteta in 😭😭
The way zaa took the Mike back after troopz mentioned sam alladice like no, no,no no. He flipping knows
Troopz turns heel backstage
I love zah
Wow the way he snatched the mic left likkle man stressed . Peaaaaak bruv
Aftv from wish
Man's did Zah wrong
These is funnier than aftv
I thought mikel was a masterstroke 😂😂
Listen to Zaa I'm amazed man's American hes talking more truth than  troopz,  the owners need to be hotted up
You pissed me off with that sam alladice comment, downgrading the expectations of the fans, this is arsenal.
Come on you SPURSSSSSS!!!! YID ARMY. Jog on back to Woolwich joke club , and these fans ffs massive show up for the club
That's right continue embarrassing yourselves on TV.
D'VON.................... GET THE TABLES!!!
Why this feel ber scripted
I love the American Ty
1:00 FACTS
Emile Smith Rowe deserves a chance
Troops yelling at a dewarf it what I needed tonight 😂😂😂😂😂 come on you spurs
LOOL Troopz is like the rock in he’s prime wwf promo 🤦🏿‍♂️
You write man
Artekaz😂😂
He really said big man ting when a guy is standing On a stool
😂🤣🤣👍👍
Z is right. Troopz wrong
Trropz Tv, shows us some 2meter  rule, hahahaha
Troopz sold
Be real arsenal doing bad is better for these guys and fair play if arsenal started winning no one would watch anymore
We got our American TY :D
Can’t stand ppl trying to defend bellerin, the guys doesn’t give a shit about being a footballer. He’s a fashion designer/ social media influencer he needs to move to Fulham or espanyol or something
Yo troops 🤬🤬🤬 man is angry
FUCK THE PROCESS!!
You said 2 nil With your Chest..... WITH YOUR CHEST💀☠
Blaaaddddclaaaaat Yang ....
I'VE JUST  HAD ENOUGH ARTETA OUT WE NEED SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE
I would make Troopz manager now! Get him back from NY to the Emirates and give him the contract!
This is acting.
No ratings badding up that little guy  Man would of laid his Clart out one bat business
AMN at CDM no cap
Someone please sack Arteta and this American Arteta in guy!
LOOK HOW MUCH I CARE.IAM A PROPER FAN smh how embarrassing
Is there any point being out there if arsenal are just a mid table club
Two melts
No troopz no party!!!!!
Arteta out. Simple as.
0:48 big up the camera man 🤣
I agree Arsenal has a squad of wet players. All your leaders are unregistered
when he said BIG MAN TING to him
Why's he in the states?
This is fake to get views
CLART DEM
Lmfaooo zah is basically the American Ty
Dead players dead team your shit and you know  you are
Troppz is right ..these other guys are clueless
Troopz is just straight up bullying the dwarf at this point
You have some anger issues bro
Wtf is this
TROOPZ money can change things but will it depends on the board they signed him and did not back him. When he gets sacked same thing.
Arsenal performance is keeping me up all night. Someone please wake me up and say it's a dream.
Want to swap American ty with British
Big man ting  Leave it out man he’s stood on a box, no need to dig
Arteta out idiot
Arteta and Gabriel came because of Arteta troops. Stop being embarrassing
Thought McMahon, Triple H, or Steve Austin will barge in anytime
Arteta get out .
We are 15th you walad 😂😂😂😂
Honestly,Arteta has totally lost the plot!!
Not an Arsenal player but if they had half of Troopz passion, they’d be world betters. They’ve never had a leader on the pitch since Viera.
Let's get a new coach and in one season troops will scream again COACH OUT.
how much of this interview was scripted
Get troops on SKY SPORTS ASAP
The future is Claret.
Its pretty obvious the players don't listen or like Arteta especially when you see the players on social media saying that their free from the lock up
Troopz tell little man,Big man ting 😂😂😂😂😂
Zah was bricking it 😂😂😂
I love Troopz he's right
Cringe
Troopz is like the extra loud foreigner🇺🇸
Troopz, please get a new camera man, fuck ill even come do the job better.  Put the camera on a tripod. Way too much movement. AND the camera man disrespected your co-worker.  How can you allow this?
If you came to see the action click here: 2:25
Much love for Troopz, arteta is taking us to championship next season, as an arsenal I can’t even brag of my club because we’re shit, am not even sure we will survive championship competition
WWE promo lmao
Is this a skit ?🎭
I can't help but laugh at the way troopz looked at zah when he said arteta in 🤣
Idk I like troopz but this reaction doesn’t seem authentic ygm
This is so fucking funny, karma's a bitch huh.
Troopz dissed mini Robbie to pieces.
I love the passion sports fans have. 😂🤣🤣 an underperforming team goin’ make you irate 🤞. Great interview boys.🤙🤙
Besides Partey Arsenal's midfield is pure shit. They sold Ramsey, Iced Ozil, sent Guenduouzi out on loan......all players better than the current midfield.
Long story short: Fans with fervour and a club that is furtive.
my man snatched the mic and went in *WE'RE 15TH!!*
TroopZ 😝😝😝😝I really appreciate you I love you I make me enjoy
Troopz, you should be ashamed of yourself! I understand your passion, but this behavior of yours is bullying and intimidation and nothing to do with your passion for the club
That guy was so  funny he was trying to take the mic of troopz the whole interview
🅶🅾🅾🅳
Lmfaoooooo. I love seeing Arsenal fans this season. It's not the manager this time. Getting Arteta out will lead to relegation even faster. Lmfaoooooo.
The coach and Devon dudley
Atleast Aba ended his goal drought! lol All us fans can do now is laugh because our club is a joke. Our owners have no ambition that's why they hired someone with no experience. Come practise your craft on us. Xhaka is shit. Bellerine is shit. Laca is shit. Imagine Smith rowe, balogun and niles starting that game. We might actually have won. These wenger players are fucking horrible and we are only getting worse. Every player is declining under Arteta and that's a fact. #Artetaout
Everyone was dancing when we got partey and when we beat man united which was only by a penalty lol. Look whats happened lol.
we need an experinced coach max allegri.....not like henry and viera...we are done with the rookies
since troopz has been there we havent scored a goal from open play in the prem 😥
Well rehearsed lol. America loves acting in sports lol.
The other guy speaking about football in an American accent don’t sit right with me
Xhaka told the fans to f*** off at that point he should of gone.  Arteta called him back into the team so it is the managers fault.  Arteta out he is deluded, his after match interviews are getting embarrassing to watch. We had possession and they had nothing??? We passed it sidewards and they scored to get three points haha.
Staged, fake...
What happened to Artekkers blud?
Karma for telling us united fans 15th I guess
Zah looks like he just saw a ghost when Troopz took the mic
Mini Robbie
Love troopz but bro, this new show, your new guests are shocking mate, get back to England and back on AFTV. even the flag in the background feel off the wall, sums it all up 🤣😂
#freeozil
A lot of shit acting honestly
I’m not kidding I thought I had seen it all with this dude you need to check yourself you balloon . This interview will go viral and you look like a nut case I’m passionate about my team but I don’t know if I’m watching passion with you ?????????
Troopz is right some of us been down this road with Arsenal for too long, my son was just 5 when he will cry about Arsenal losing games, he's 19 now not crying anymore but fed up of same old shit. This player look like they want Arteta sack though they are all Ozil's click, they don't like what's going and it's showing on the pitch. Things will up for while with new manager but this mediocre players need to go.
What on Earth is Troopz doing, get back to London.
Big man ting
Shoutout to my guy troops
I thought supporting United was hard but see what Arsenal does to you 😭😂🙏🏾
If Arteta left.. who will replace him?.
aven't got my hair cut since the Pandemic started. Chic looked at me when she seen it and was like "EWWW." I just pulled up my pants and walked off
QPR look forward to playing u next season
Aubama what? Aubama who???
This short guy is fuckin deluded. He keeps arguing with the man. Let him speak and get off the goddamn barstool!
Ty looks different without his hat on
I’m a liverpool fan but I feel your pain bruv hopefully Arsenal end up in Europa
Agree with troopz about allardyce,  horses for courses
Why is this fool calling for arteta troops out
He grabbed that mic quick😂
Troopz literally went to New York to meet another ty
0:49 🤣🤣 is that why they call it barstool tv?
Comedian Troopz,  you could not talk to robbie like that. FAKE!
Ozil is washed he has underperformed for years & he’s a passenger
They need to bun this camera man.
take it easy troopz social services see this they take kid away
Sam Allardyce or Alan Pardrew who are the Arsenal fans taking
Best thing ever seen in 2020
2017 WENGER OUT 2020 WENGER IN
Use your fucking head 😂😂😂
Money grabbers here.  Well constructed interview
Troop$ the sellout
Mans grabbed the mike hahaha troopz your some boy. Big up
😂😂😂😂😂

He bought willian for fucks sake hows it kronkesproblem
Troopz better get his ass back to London ASAP.
Supporting arsenal isn't good for ur health
pure comedy, like the football team 😂
I don’t see how Arteta is a good manager, yes he won the FA Cup but he still finished like 8th. But what’s worse is that Arteta has no plan whatsoever other than pray Auba scores which he ain’t this year. There’s no plan B and blaming players isn’t gonna solve anything unless Arsenal want to wait 4-5 years to finally get other players in to be good, but then they’ll be finishing in low spots cuz Arteta can’t manage anything or than putting out cones.
Mateeee ahahahaha I beg arsenal loses their next game🤣 these interviews keep on getting better and better
Which episode of Raw is War is this?
A Tounge Twister  A homesick homie, honing homing missiles ,after a home loss. Make them all homeless , there hopeless.
how can you blame Manager for not picking ozil. Are you mad? Logical speaking there's more to why ozil is not playing. Most likely political reason. You cannot believe everything someone says.
0:08 😭
Its like Mark Henry took the mic from hornswogle
I died when he took the mic 😂😂😂
Troopz could hurt someone, you guys need to hold him😀😀
Ozil sword
PARTEY HARD what happened to PARTEY HARD
I was taking this seriously, till I saw the camera pan down to the wooden box 😂 who gave Wilfred Zaha the  day off, to interview Troopz 😂
tension building up here bruh
Arsenal need to bring in Allardyce, Pulis or Hughes in order to secure their prem status
get zaha
Arsenal been letting quality players leave on a free transfers and replacing them with mediocre ones and expecting to win the league. Money would attract the best players Troops that's why ManCity and Chelsea are doing better than us. Football has moved in that direction, the biggest purses gets the best players that is modern football 4 u sir...
IF YOU SMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLL WHAT THE TROOPZ IS COOKING.
If all arsenalfans act like Troopz, you aint going nowhere. Other guy is more on point..players are to blame. The manager is paying for previous managers mistakes in recruitment. Ageing squad, no fight, zero winning mentality, and internal conflict with key profiles.   Arteta is under the gun for sure.. but its still early in the season. Needs a few results before january though..
He can cross trust me and shoot better. Plus Ceballos should be a starter plus for me Pepe over Willian also all the rotate thing ain't getting these players on form. We take far to long to pick a pass by time we decide to pass the chance has gone. It's clear that the players ain't tryna play for this guy anymore. Plus I was saying it's time for Big Sam last night if it's gonna be a fight 😂 , 2 mistakes he shouldn't have got rid of these guys Guendouzi and Torreira not afraid to put a foot in and willing to pick that pass and then no Ozil who can pick a pass and got rid of Ljungberg 😂 🤹🤹🤹 moves mate.
Arteta OUT!
Fuck sake Troopz mate sort it out, cringed through all of that video felt like a WWE interview Michael Cole interviewing the Rock you're taking this peoples champ to far now 😂😂😂 get back to AFTV, they made you. Shouldn't be out in New York or whatever it is the fuck you are. What do Americans know about football 🙈😴
Finlay and Hornswoggle are back. !!!
I loved this interview 😄😄😄
0:11 that zoom in gave me the office vibes
When you order Robbie off of wish
I like troopz and dont care about AFTV anymore but 250k views already for this trash?
No droplets dropped in the making of this video  Guaranteed
This is scripted
Damn that mic grab... this is epic
When did Arsenal become a WWE franchise?
Zah is Zimbabwean 🇿🇼 btw...
🤣🤣🤣why did the camera man pan down to the box little man is standing on
He called Zah a ‘fucking Walled’ that was abit much. I get he is angry his team are shit but there is no need to insult people.
What the actual fuck is this
100% Arteta in all day he is the manager who will lead arsenal to glory in the championship 😂😂😂😂😂come on gonners 💪😂
STRESSSSSSSSSSS
Damn Robbie looks shorter
This is scripted af
Why is troopz talking to zah like that? He would never talk to Robbie like that.
Troopz- you know where City were before they got the Rich owners? Bottom half. If the owners persist with Mike ‘L’ then they will have to overpay for quality players. Doesn’t matter what position we are in, go get your cheque book out Stan and get the right players
Absolute cringe when yanks say mandem
Let the guy speak Troopz.. You loudmouth prick
Arsenal sooo shit mans are making money off of youtube vidz😂😂😂😂
Haha troopz real fan spitting facts this team is shit man
All he need 3 games after United match. From my manager to arteta out. LoL. Same ol same ol troopz.
“BIG MAN TING” to a dude that’s 4ft f*ck all😂😂😂😂 ahhhh!! Toooo much
New word: “Previouses”.
Come on arsenal get relegated 🙏🙏🙏
Yo tye I like ya cut G
Man said i am mini robbie 🤣
At minute 3:00 he goes "Big Man Ting" to a 3 foot dwarf. That shit was hilarious. 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz just remain in the US Arsenal performances are getting better week after week
Man said big man ting looooool
Holy shit this is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
I’m not Arteta In but it’s true, the players are wack. I don’t care who got picked or what form you are in. OUR 11 is better than Burnley and in all honesty- they ALL apart from Gabby Saka and KT3 are trash!!

Guys Ozil is very likely not playing due to political reasons. He publicly endorses Turkish president and he has a right to but Arsenals cash cow is China. That's where the conflict is up top. He is an influencer and Arsenal dont want to rock the boat. That's why no one is giving clear insight as to why he won't play, where do you even begin?Sad
We can change manager, which probably would fix the problem short term. But to truly get some change we need to change 70% of the squad and get rid of Kroenke for a owner with cash who cares
OUT  Milkle Arteta
This comment section is too much man I'm dying
“Money fixes everything”🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aaaaaah hahahahaha funniest thing I've seen in years
He has a point. Big Sam would never get relegated.
So Troops left Robbie for this.....absolute relagation for me
"We're 15th"  😂😂😂
Troops Is Real Soldier
Troopz please take your time with it 😂😂😂😂😂 thanks for bringing aubas legs man dem
As a lover of football I hate to see a big club like Arsenal heading in this direction but in terms of being a rival fan I'm also loving this 😂😂😂😂
For weeks and weeks zah was blindly agreeing with everything troopz says.  Let's start faking it...
Not kidding Troopz forgot more about football than anyone at barstool ever knew and I’m a Spurs supporter
zah should be an actor....his face expressions is priceless!
Best interview ever 😂😭😂
#TroopzIsBack
Comedy gold this 😂
Question Time!! If Arteta manages to win Europa league and we finish in bottom half of table, Are you still Arteta out????
When troops said “big man ting”
dnt like troopz shouting 😂😂😂😂 he myt as well hold the mic and talk to himself no interviewer
Troopz u are a absolute wally !! What kind of wwe foolishness in s this
Troopz I like you but your chatting shit, you want Sam alladice who the fuck will we compete with when we have him, furthermore 8:30 zaa said it we have one of the richest man in the world this guy needs to whip out a paycheck
As a united fan I extremely enjoyed this rant. Give arteta a chance
Yeah, but but but....... Ole hahahahahaha, fucking jokes club
2:31 Was this a heel turn by Troopz... I am telling you now bruv Wrestlemania 37 Zah VS Troopz.... ITS HAPPENING
Sam alladice,  troops please don't joke and make that acceptable, for arsenal we need a top tier manager, these owners are gonna give us fat sam trust me we fucked
Pain
Let him dye in his own movie arteta is just fake
IMAGINE BEING A GROWN ADULT STANDING ON A STOOL BEING YELLED AT ABOUT ARSENAL LIKE A 4 YEAR OLD.
When the American says mandem 😂
I really like this guy, patient as fuck too.
Really no hopeeee I can seeee
Arteta outttttttttttttt
😂😂😂
Troops wooo big pundict  thanks big bro #ozil and arteta out true where is cendric for sure
Troopz has zaa against the wall in the thumbnail
My Mum is Wenger In Now  She is not mad  Not Troopz
Chelsea had dead weights as well : Michy,Moses,Willian,Pedro, Danny,bakayoko,Emerson,Alonso,Rudiger,Kepa,zapaCosta etc. One transfer window was  needed for Frank to manage those dead weight..  You need good player to be in top 4, not to beat a team like burnley..
I love it! COME ON YOOOOOOOOOOOU SPURS......
“With your chest!” 😂 I’m dying over this video.
what is going on my best life ever in this moment 😂
xD umm testy testy x) lol  what is more funny than this hostile discussion is the accent  bla.bla.bla fam bla.bla.bla fam
This video needs JR & Jerry Lawler commentary!
real talk
l thing arteta and paley's broblem 🤬
Arsenal fans are thick as fuck hahaha
Bro listen to the man money talks how have teams like West Ham and Villa, even Brighton drop £40 mill and not make a big song and dance and Arsenal make a big stupidness to drop 100M but still want to be challenging. You can’t eat alacart  if you are shopping at ‘NETO’ (if you don’t know google it). Just look at Chelcy who they bought and there having hiccups it’s deeper than a manager - we need to be relegated 🤞🏾we bounce strait back up and with new owners
Troopz on Fire, i love it. My man Troopz teaching this dude a football lesson. Coz its clowning to say Arteta in, its an insult to all Arsenal fans. ARTETA OUT.
It's good to finally see Ty without his full kit on.
0:03 - 0:15 is just premium content...  Troopz probably thinking about a 1000 ways to drop kick Lil man
Hahha troopz man
Love the rant, it’s been a crap year no holidays no going to games no Christmas, the only joy I’ve had this year is watching AFTV and this channel so funny , keep up your passion, Andy Spurs fan
😂😂😂 They Were once #1
WWE interview
Arsenal fucked up not buying atleast 2 good first team players after winning the FA cup
It’s Kronky for me bro - willak and Smithrow for me bro
You didn't have to show him standing on a box hahahahahaaaaaaa I'm crying 😭
God. This boy needs to fucking grow up. It’s football, if I was this guys girlfriend I’d be grossed out beyond belief. She needs to get herself a proper man, not this little boy screaming his head off and shouting blud every 2 seconds. Who actually bloody acts like a mad man about to kill someone when their football team looses. It actually kills me🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
Play the kids
Yo this is bigger than a manager bro we need to get Kronky out
At least he doesn't say blud, fam, and know wat ey mean, at the end of every other sentence anymore. Who says USA hasn't contributed to the English language!!
Stop mentioning Aouar his fucking dog shit this season
If you have shit players that are shit... how's it the coaches fault..  he came to the club to coach shit players... if you sack him the next coach will be training shit players
One thing is sure after watching this video!! There are multiple Tys around the world.
At what point do the players take any responsibility for their actions and performance? I always hated hearing grown men referring to themselves as "lads and boys" because it infers that they are kids with diminished responsibility rather than professionals hired to do a job!
They threw Ozil under the bus. All the other players aged 30 years and over are done and know that's how the board will treat them - with disrespect. Auba has gotten his mega contract and he's done. He's 31 and will never come close to his form last season. No matter how good Arsenal fans think Auba is, the reality is, his is declining and he's shown it from game one this season. Arteta handled Ozil's case VERY BADLY. Backing Ozil would have been the greatest managerial decision Arteta could have made. But he followed the stupid Board in enacting a stupid vengeance that did not make sense. Ozil was by and large the best creator at the club. Now it's come to bite Arteta. Managers must understand that the board does not care about them. The fans don't care about them too no matter what you won for them. The aim of every manager should be their job. Arteta will lose his job and another manager will come in and bring Ozil back.
" The next Varane" - Yeah, Varane is the greatest defender in the world!! Ask this Real Madrid fan. No wonder Arsenal has the greatest defence in the world. But it works only after the game is over!!
So sorry for your lost but so many entertaining details in this video 😂😭😭
Hhhh it's a catastrophe
Troops Tv need to invest in two 🎤 s instead of one!
This zah guy seems to know jack about football. Seems like he is just a arsenal for the sake of the show. He is probably just a NY Giants fan or something. Giant fan hahaha no pun intended
All of this was part of the script
2:30
We don't need big names to fix our problems. Anything is better than this dead team right now.
Zah is clueless like Arteta...if we not sack Arteta now when will we sack him, After we relegated...I'm tired with these Blind fans...
Chelsea Chelsea
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 omg it’s too funny
What happened to arteta being a better manager than ole?🤣🤣🤣💀
0:48 Had me crying
Stay calm and visit Rwanda :-)
I heard saliba is not in the team because of certain comments him and guendouzi made about arsenal on Twitter
A fucking WWE promo 😂😂😂😂
This ain't acting. All Arsenal fans are feeling like this ..or even more animated tbh because our fan base is divided af.
Dead ting in the club 😂😂
Who's this don think he is trying to talk over troopz??!? Man trying to force a reaction. Man thinks money attracts big players ? Dead ting look at a.c Milan. Money only attracts good players when you're on top.  It attracts the dead players when you're at rock bottom. Fool
MAN REALLY SAID SAM ALLARDYCE IN
🤡🤡Arteta .....🤡A🤡R🤡T🤡E🤡T🤡A🤡.......🤡........
Ogs should watch this channel!!!!
WITH YOUR CHEST!!! HAHA O Lord that had me in hysterics.
Hasn’t been this bad. True but seems with the way it’s going emery was worse than wenger and artera worse. The next may be even worse
This is the best content ever.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 coming from a chelsea fan it's funny but I'm genuinely feeling sorry for this team
Who's intervìewing who????
Love the debates, don’t take his mic ya tit!
Troops is bullying this guy I wonder if he would talk to rob like that
Yea guendouzi a person who plays with all his heart I agree he should be bench for that incident but not froze him out 3 matches is enough, arteta man coaching is horrible  ,arteta out pleas please I am done
Not Cedric play ainsley maitland niles  please for fuck sake arteta out
Zah and troopz look like they wanna scrap
Artekkas blud, you know dem way there? What a delusional guy troopz is. Well deserved.
Always Manager out, wasn’t it u lot that yapped “title challenge” and felt so good and satisfied with him? All of a sudden it’s “out” U guys r Jst a joke
Troopztv and chills bruh
How you feeling this morning troopz 🤣🤣🤣 banter fc are gold viewing at the moment..
It’s Barstool sports. You gota get the stool in.
That's correct about no one wants to join a club in free fall with no European football.
3:00...”BIG MAN TING” 🤣🤣🤣
wow troops had a better performance in less than 10 min than the WHOLE ARSENAL squad
Troopz is a Lost Soul
Scott McChicken 🥪 ... DT needs to take back this  back.😂😂
this is so scripted....
Someone needs to stand up or tic toc tic toc.... we're gone
Where are your masks 🎭 no social distant either 👌👮‍♀️people are shouting bring Wenger in now !
ARTETA OUT
Nigel Pearson would do a good job for you guys, he would get everyone to fight like their life was on the line.
Interview feels forced and fake🤔
This itw is giving me Covid PTSD
Bruh Americans don’t understand how Football works. It’s easier to ship out a manger then sell a squad.
Everything Troppz said was absolute fact s
I cba to support this club fuck this
Wow troopz is really short
Heavy D left this world so he didn’t have to see this
It’s it wwe or what?? 😅😅
WWE backstage vibes
That guy is a poor presenter. I'd recommend for him not to look at camera when doing interviews. Don't use word mandem it don't come over.
Troopz was really close to straggling somebody
Wtf is this
When the other dude says "Mandem" at the end in his american accent, it cracks me up lol
Reckon that Aubamayang's goal will win December goal of the month for Arsenal.
Good to see Robbie has grown he’s hair over lockdown
Ive got a 7 month old baby who is lively and hard to keep calm. He just watches this and was blown away by this.
Don't wait relegation plz, sack him as soon as possible ....
4:05 the short man is soo sad blood
4:58 Man said “that’s your guy 🙄” about auba he’s defo on a wind up trying to get reactions 😂😂😂
Someone keep an eye on Troopz.  I'm starting to worry about him no BS.
Troopz, please keep doing the good work till we get an interim manager - Arsene Wenger to hold the team while we take time to sign a permanent Head coach for the club in Summer.
WWE
With the way troopz scream. He'll soon be given a quit notice
Arteta Out! Now!
😂😂😂
Is yours gold hahahahahahahahha Watta walad but it only counts as ☝️ ynwa 🇦🇱🇦🇺
Can we all just take a moment to remember when troopz said man united wake up every weekend hoping Sheffield, Fulham and west Brom lose cuz that’s our competition... yea its not looking good rn troopz LOOOL
Troopz went all the way there to do show with Ty's twin
ZAH MONEY DOES NOT GET ALL THE PLAYERS COMING TO A TEAM TO 15TH THEY WILL SABOTAGE THEIR CAREER.
So is it arteta’s fault that lacca auba and Gabriel missed good chances. Is it arteta’s fault that xhaka got sent off.  I would also like to point out that the majority of the team is players inherited from the Wenger era and were not good enough then and need to be replaced that’s not arteta’s fault either. Arteta is still the man for the job and even if he is replaced his successor is going to have exactly the same problem.
Troopz: "This is Artekkers!!"
This fun to watch 😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal are going on like schalke, soon enough its not going to be about the tactics and the football and the players or even the coach, its a mentality thing and as u said its easier to change the manager who aint good enough anyway
What drama is this 😂
Camera man you taking the piss 😂 😂
Big Sam will just about keep arsenal up
"Heated Debate"  oh wait wrong channel
Aubama-*WHAT?....*
They can't afford 2 mics? This is a weird pantomime.
I think let troops manage Arsenal FC. Its very easy to talk rather then doing it. You'll feel the same heat when you are in that position. Shouting and cursing him, back him up. All what pundits and fan base can do it just sit talk crap and curse. Be in that position  and you'll see how much you sweat your ass troopz. Not easy as it look. Perioddddd
What is this
Arteta must be sack he's nt a good  coach. he's don't no the good players to use.he's taking the club to relegation believe me guys.
Love that Mic grab, classic 🤣🤣🤣👌
Recall torreira
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂⚽️
This is gold 😂 Arsenal should keep losing
it just aint the same 🤦🏾‍♂️ troopz come home
Brilliant piece from both u G's.. Arteta isn't good enough but then again as a Villa fan I stood by Dean Smith right to the end and he managed to turn it round but If I'm honest we didn't do it.. Watford and Bournemouth fucked up big time... Watford were 7pts ahead of us with 4 games to go and they fuckin' bottled it.. I said it on another Arsenal stream earlier last night that ur going down with this manager in charge. It's probably for the best lads. I'm not bantering u lads on this. I'm being deadly serious. My club,  AVFC, was galvanised by the relegation but at the same time we nearly went into admin only to see 2 owners come in to save us bcos we nearly lost Grealish to ur enemy. That baldy ski slope nosed cunt Daniel Levy first offered 25mil but when the silly head like a tit without a nipple cunt Levy found out we were fucked he offered 1 mil for our boy Jack. Sorry for ranting lads. I know it's not funny. Have u watched Lee Gunners video tonight?? It's so fucking funny. 😂 😂 😂
15TH PLACE BACK AGAIN!!!
im sorry but Troopz look so out of place being interviewed by anybody but Robbie
Troopz this is so staged.   How are you getting this worked up watching on a TV?   All about the views so poor
Again Arteta have no balls and he is a very poor judge of good talent. He will not succeed at Arsenal he will not turn the situation around. Too many good players he refuse to play all i could tell Saliba hold on we will have a new Manager soon
Troopz should have gave Zah the stone cold stunner after he snatched the mike away from him.
This is so shit
Kinda Felt bad for Little man there Troopz kinda bullied his ass
1:22 so has Lampard
Who’s this donny 😂
He grabbed the fucking mic from ma guy, this dude crazy deadass 😂😂😂😂😂,
I have said it a few time. Zah is basically just the american version of Ty 😂😂😂😂
As a Man U fan, this makes me feel better about our situation.
Cant even admit spurs are the best team in the league at the moment.
When Troopz grabbed the mic I lost it 😭😂😭😭😂😂😂
I had too much laugh, that was a fun interaction
Keep this shit show up mate 😂 😂 troops is more of a joke than arsenal. Angry little tit ahahahhaahaha
The fact is the prayers are frustrated as per incidents that keep on happening in the game like Xhaka's, Elneny's and more of past
I swear this feels like I'm watching a mockumentary this has to be scripted 🤣
Troopz crying about who'd want to play for a team in 15th.....fam if the manager and board shows a plan to the players they want to sign and make them important pieces to the teams future, they'd absolutely wanna join. You ain't getting Aouar, but atleast whoever joins will be better than Xhaka Stop this nonsense of Arteta out, he has nothing but love for Arsenal...and even you know it
arsenal fan you gotta love them
"A u fuckin deluded" mahn dey pist😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Got yourself a leprechaun hmm, 😂
As I life long arsenal fan the problem isn't with arteta it's the management arteta is like pochettino with tottenham upper management won't give you what you want you just have to work with what you have and second they don't have a leader and theyre keeping ozil as a prisoner I say what we should do along with troopz and all of my arsenal brothers and sisters please let's do this have a online petition to have stan kronke sell the club to someone who will spend money for success not for the revunue and for the brand but for the success of the club I wish the qatari owner of psg will buy our club and get rid of this heavy contracts for aubameyang,lacazzete and ozil and give ozil a chance and get a superstar he is hungry who is not yet in his peak plus get a world class manager I love arteta but he is not the one for me get allegri because for max allegri is the one who can turn this club or pochettino or the previous barca manager I forgot his name or maurizio sarri
Wenger was chased because were top 4 and 5.karma is bitch.
Troopz gonna be a hit in America.
All in All Arteta out
WITH YOUR CHEST!!!
Big man ting
Mans always real af....big ups Troopz!!!!!!
No matter how pissed off we are about Arsenal results.  We still cannot talk to each other this way.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Troopz you’re 100% right. Atteta should go now if not Arsenal is going down. He does not read the game before making his substitution. Nkettia had no business yesterday in that match. He need more aggressive and direct players like wilock or nelson but Atteta keep making the same mistakes every game. He’s confused and job is bigger than him. He’s actin pep  tough guy when his not pep.
This guy is the new ty
hahah this is pure gold. Eddie Howe is a good shout
"Trust the process"
Sack him please, Zah its not 25 dead players. The manager is making then look shit, some are actually shit the xhaka and bellerin but others are good. This manager is shit and needs to go.
😂😂
Arteta made arsenal more defensively solid but at the moment ozil is necessary him coming in dosent mean arsenal will start scoring goals but his contribution could work out
Zah giving me ty vibes lmfaoo
your top 15 bro
Bro go back to London its the most logical solution...
Troopz makes my day😂😂
Well said zah dey av ta take responsibility.....FACTS
Man said Arleta had one only window    Lampard : hold my beer 🍺  -Top 4
3:33 😂
He saying same ting every time
Poor guy wants to send troopz back bless him😭😂
why did the camera pan to the stool at 0:50 the disrespect 😂😂
Ah the good old zoom in zoom out effect to add dramatics like shit dramas
After united "my manager". 3 games later..."Arteta out". Embarrassing.
Arsenal must stop pleasing the chinese government and free mesut
It's amusing to see arsenal in  serious termoil from a Chelsea fan😁😁😁
Mic snatch😳😡
3:40 Troopz turns into Vince Mcmahon 😂😂😂
Is anybody else waiting for Lee Gunner and Claide to come rushing around the corner and to steam into Zah with some chairs screaming 'fuck the process, it's time to go!''
Auba-ma-who??? Auba-ma-what???  Auba-ma-own-goal-yang!!! 😂😂😂  #copied
London Club for Londoners . . . . "Big man Ting" you know 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🏽
GOOD EBENING. HOW MANY TRANSFER WINDOW DID EMERY GET? Troopz didn't back Wenger either.
This is set up..fake trrooz tv
Man 😂 i miss wwf attiude era
Say it Troopz Say it Say it Say the O word.
Troops bro u are in America. Korenkes do not care about Arsenal. No manager doesn't matter how good he is can make Arsenal like they used to be in their golden era. Arsenal need new owner more they need new manager. Look at abrahimovic or sheik Mansur how they are running their club. Arsenal need a owner who is passionate about football. korenkes are American they don't care about football they only love baseball, basketball etc. As long as korenkes are sitting on Arsenal's throne Arsenal will never winning any big trophies mark my word.
As a united fan, I love this 🤣🤣
Social distancing at its best :)
im genuinely scared for my man's life.
Passionate man there having a old WWE interview on  Barstool, for real Arsenal moving silently
I like how unlike Robbie he argues back and go against troopz
I subscribed just for troopz lol 😂 😂
I can’t stand listening to Americans trying to speak about soccer loool
Zah is saying facts
Dwarf not stop chatting nonsense that's y TROOPZ a disrespect u
Arteta must  go
I’ll take David Moyes  I’ll take ANY BODY
😂😂😂😂😂 some wwe interview
Life’s come at you fast 🤣🤣, You guys wake up every weekend playing shielfied, westbrom, Burnley and loose, Thats your competition 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz showing America what it's about. Hope he apologized to zah but I'm sure him and barstool understand
Sorry but discipline comes from the Top....it shows that Arteta doesn't have the authority he thinks he has with the players...  Proof is in the the disciplinary record and lack of results.
This is the best thing in wrestling today
Little man got scared at 2:30 hhh
I genuinely think Arsenal can win the league next season the way they’re playing. Arteta is still learning as a coach but I reckon with a few additions and Aubameyang firing they can pip Millwall to the Division 2 title.  🤷🏽‍♂️
This channel is just like Arsenal. A JOKE lol
Zah is just making troopzzz angry
Auba who? Auba what?   Aubame-blooodclatt-yang!!! !  My brother said Burnley fans
I was waiting for Teddy Long to come through that door,   “Tonight playa, for all that hollering, You will go one on one, with the Undertaker!!!”
Gold
Stupidity, Arteta brought in Willian going by that trend we should not let him waste any more arsenal cash on transfers. We have a good squad to warrant a top 5 position, Arteta is a shitty manager.
The cameraman did him dirty by randomly recording his feet 😂😭
3:34 brilliant 😂
This is what you get when you are a fan of a club that buys an ordinary recruits and expects them to play like a field Marshalls in the battle of Generals
Sick promo interview. It's like Attitude Era never left us lmao
I was scared for ZAH for real ... 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
8:42 😂😂😂
best interview ever lol from a united fan... but troopz should take it easy with the dude
The interviewer is seriously DELUDED.
the camera man is a bitch.. why he turned the camera like that lmao
My dawrgg, Forreal I hope y’all fix up. Auba lost his goal scorering touch and team struggling for identity
Troopz wwe promo
Use were attractive because use won the fa cup hahaha arteta in hahaha do you think use can win the league next season haha enjoy the championship hahahaha
2:23 .. LET THE RUMBLE BEGIN!
This is legendary
# Bring Ozil Back
Beat the sit oit of each other Arsenal Bafoons...hahaha
Anybody else think he should go back to Aftv
Wait a minute, I searched “Clash of clans troops comparison” on YT , What is this???
This troop guy don’t know nothing about football lmao wants every manager out after a few loses 😂😂😂😂
Dude talks so much but clearly never played
Troopz is so clueless about football it’s sad
I'd say Troopz knows a long a lot more than what he's letting on.
The camera pan at 0:50. What was that about?
Arteta is just a scapegoat. He was played out by his own players. Xhaka is not bought by Arteta. The way he squeeze the throat of the opponent, he already knew that he is killing himself and the manager. Even his tackle leading to the red card is ridiculous. His kick was aimed at the Burnley leg and not the ball at all.
Didn't these guys won the transfer market  back in August,business and money well spent?
Money fixes everything Troopz
I half expected Arteta to come out with a chair and bash his head 😁😁
This is peak cinema!
Troops and black tyrion
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Troopz gimme a call Where's Max Allegri
Big man ting while the little man is standing on the yellow pages to get in view
aubawho aubawhere aubabloodcartgone
Don’t worry guys next year Arsenal will win championship for sure👍🏻👍🏻
Eyyo WWE take this guy for your promo class dude
This is turning into Ty and Claude thing. Good days ahead 😁😁
TYs American brother. ARTETA OUT. STOP BUYING AFC MERCH. #KROENKEOUT
Pheeeew that was rough
Your team is shocking they so bad you guys are getting religated
ILLUMINATI BLAD!
man look hella stressed
Well the new Robbie is pretty bad FAM
Due to footballing reasons Arteta out
He said big man ting to a midget I'm fucking dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Sell xhaka, luis
Relegation zone
Truth on ozil is the Uighurs tweet bro China pressure hence why we are cursed now bad energy
Zah is somehow right,not everything blame on Arteta,the players need to show their love for the club and fight for the club, with no goals, I think Auba need to seat on the bench and let the young stars like Balogun to show him how goals are scored 😉
WWE backstage
After Biggin up Arteta like Troopz an co have u know they're embarrassed. I know I am,I have said for years now  the likes of Xhaka Bellerin among many more in the squad are just dead dead FUCKIN DEAD
Zah is robbie AFTV mini me dr evil 😀😀😀 I was waiting for troopz to RKO manoeuvre zah off his stool 😂
This guy is Arteta in after playing Xhaka Elneny midfield duo at home to fucking burnley lmao Jesus Christ
When troopz snatched the mike, the other guy was scared 😅😅😅
The big show n stone cold steve austin interviews up next on wwe raw 😐
If Arsenal don't want to get relegated they need Troopz back in the UK, Ozil back in the squad simple, Wenger back in the dugout
ArtetaIn He Will make Arsenal Win A Championship
Camera work is brilliant. It looks like a promo to the fight. Arsenal are shocking. I am Man United fan and even I did not expect this. Troopz looking like volcano eruption. Xhaka what are you doing 😂
Lmao this made my day wtf these guys are soooo hyped  big man ting
Arsenal heading for relegation!
This is what they are paying him for.
bellerin can't cross? c'mon dude stop talking shit....
We as fans dont deserve this where we are but the board deserves it Kroneke deserves it players deserve it Manager deserve it  ...does it effect them no Frauds it only effects fans Unite everyone get Kroneke out
Zah is tys son
Xahka out... mustafi out.... arteta out arsenal my favorite team  </3 :'(
getting allegri or someone like that in won’t suddenly allow xhaka to turn
🕺 TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT 🕺
😂😂😂😂😂😂 GOLD. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know it's bad when Arsenal fans are actually thinking about relegation.
Troops you have to look back at Liverpool we was in the doldrums we had players like Johnny Dundee, Le Tallec we was the club to offload the deadwood too.  The deadwood and the bloodsuckers have to be GOT RID OF  FIRST. Before a Foundation or Process can start. The bloodsuckers have to be cut out because these are the people that the youngsters are looking up to. Arteta has been given a token gesture backing. THE BACKING THAT YOUR MANAGER NEEDS IS THAT YOU REALISE THAT HE IS FIGHTING WITH ONE HAND BEHIND HIS BACK. YOU GUYS NEED TO STOP BUYING ARSENAL MERCHANDISE THE SHIRTS NEED TO STAY IN THE SHOPS. This is what SHAM KRONKEDOUT UNDERSTAND'S  YOU WANT OUR BUSINESS THEN YOU NEED TO DO THE BUSINESS. AND STOP BANKROLLING HOLLYWOOD PARK STADIUM.
Let's be honest arteta is weak
Come on Tyrione... a Lannister's smarter than that.
This is WWE
Sam Allardice 😂😂😂
Is ty putting a accent on 🤪
I feel like this was stage managed anyone else haha
Troopz bruv, show your colleagues some respect. The shouting and the grabbing of the mic isn’t top bins.
Remember how y’all were happy when y’all beat ManU ? Looool was that y’all last win ? 💀
Aubama-own goal-yang!!!!!
Man on a stool gets yelled at for 10 mins straight
😂😂😂
I fucking love it. Where is Tottenham in the table gents? #COYS
Am I  seeing mini Ty here 🤣🤣🤣
Zah and Ty would be a lovely conversation.
I feel bad for the other guy. Troopz just bullied the mic off him.
I love the game 😂😂
2:48 "Can I get my mic back" 😃😂😂
Black Tyrion Lannister. I've seen everything now
This short guy is deluded I’m a spurs fan and you guys played us knowing what we do and u guys play high line against the best counter attack in the league you guys have no plan no tactics no organization
3:11 answer is Partey 😂😂😂😂
so this guy is the American TY !
Top top interview camera angles brilliant 🤣🤣
“Big man ting”..... the irony of it all
Troopz just gets too personal sometimes
Rahim Sterling interviews Troopz
Lol this looks like a dad scolding his son for not studying and playing video games all day.
Wenger out wenger out
that dude funny and a good presenter 😂😂had troopz going crazy
Troopz not happy at all. I am not also.🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️!!! They need to fix this...
Instant classic
Arteta is at fault. So are players who can't keep their fans happy. Bellerin, xhaka, lacazette and many others
Just woke up on a drab morning in England and just seen this , this made my day funny as fuck 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man said were going home in a cab... Blud, arsenal walking home with no oyster card what u mean 😂
Arteta is not playing ozil because the club told him not to play him. Why? Bkoz he spoke out against china about how they’re treating muslims overthere. So china said boycott arsenal,  Arsenal said “dang we about to lose a shitload of money, dont play him and in time get rid.  That’s what I think anyway.
Hype for the views. Watchable tho
I wonder what will happen when Arsenal actually drop in the relegation zone.
Don't matter who manages arsenal.... U can't polish a turd
That look after Arteta In was the only reason, I continued watching this clip 😂
Good promo
We are going down next game we are waiting to lose this year troop you need to come back
2:25 zah was about to get choke slammed
hhhahhah last year they other guy was chilling now he's there having to take it from troopz
Haha 15th where yous belong and arsenal fans say united are shit difference between yous and us is yous are gonna be saying hello to the championship very soon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keep indulging these same players week in week out no matter what the form or results it’s no good crying when your sacked Mikel, bullsheet fucking
Love these 2 🤣♥️
SOUTHAMPTON 4 : ARSENAL 0
Remember when u thought arteta was christ resurrected when he joined?? Remember when u compared him to lampard... Remember that cos he was gaurdiolas send out yute u thought u had a pep 2.0 lol.. Reality u got the guy that gets sent shop to get the ribena and rizzla 😂😂😂... Cech, Luiz and now William..... Still ain't learnt your lesson.... What deadwood u gon a buy off Chelsea next year??

"...... with your chesssttt"

Arteta wanted Xhaka and Bellerin to stay at Arsenal. Tells you everything you need to know about this clown
When troopz told him "Big man ting" I howwwled lmaooo

this is some WWE ish
2:29 is what youre here for !
Troopz is the man!!!
😂😂🤦‍♂️
Never change Arsenal 😂😂😂
coys!!
The mic,, 🤣
He nearly got beaten by troopz 😂😂🤣
Troopz shut the fuck up arteta is a good manager but he's an amateur  playing out of form players  and making bad decisions for now  but give him upto feb for now b4  you lose it on him
I don’t watch arsenal fan tv first time watching this. It was on some other video I think HITC and o decided to check it out. Def feel the wwf vibes but is that short guy American? He doesn’t have a London accent.
arsenal lost 4 straigth home game ,arteta  is going to keep record as the fisrt manager to take asenal to championship. this is the worst arsenal tha i have seen in my life.
😩😍 Troops!
Stand by aubameyang flog everyone else😂 troops don’t wanna lose them celebrity friends😂
Who’s interviewing who here 😂 miss you troopz. Come back to aftv
Take your time with it, take your time with it, take your time with it.. Hold the L's
Nice to see Troopz has calmed down.
Here in Indonesia. We consider a team to be proud. And as well as one point from seven games. It breaks our hearts. And what we're going to do ... we come down to demand a real change. The football team may be the place of business for you. But for us, this is an honor. A pride
He will take Sam Allardyce 😂😂😂
😂😂🤣😂
This is some next level disability discrimination
These man are bottle jobs 😂
"we aren't attractive" im crying hahaha
I wanna do one of these with Troopz so bad lol
Dead ting in the rave 😂
Haha Arsenal fans karma is a bitch mocking Man utd after a lucky win  good luck in championship lol......
This looks so fake some people have said troopz was a actor on aftv
what in the wwe is this
Troops you the shit bro🤣🤣🤣🤣
The camera man be like on the Hennessy
Big man ting talking down to a migit 😂
I was expecting a fist from troopz at any moment.😅😅😅. WWE environment
As a rival fan all I can say is this is no more a joke! Majority of Arsenal fans still want the manager to stay after these results?!?!? I cant believe this 😱
Troopz out !!
Troopz Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk oooooooooooooooooooofffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Cedric is ofensif player. And hektor. I don't know.. back pass back passs and again back passs

I genuinely thought he was gonna powerslam him at one point.
This is soo WWE cross with AFTV
Black Tyrion Lannister interviewing a character from Sasha Baron Cohen's movie 🙄🤔
This is not even genuine... This looks and feels so staged. Troops what have you done
Sam Allardyce rubbing his hands at that ringing endorsement.
This is amazing! 😂😂
Hahah he smoking crack for sure!
BIG SAM INNNNNNNN
Troopz channeling his inner D Lo Brown
This on aftv wouldve been trending 1 mil views
“Hulk Hogan” brother ..
Troopz is just taking shit for views now...
Arteta 1 window but he is playing dead players
Atleast when utd lose I can say atleast I don't support arsenal
My mans said he wants big sam 😂

Not the place to say big man thing to a guy standing on  box 😂😂😂
I swear down I thought troopz was bullying my man 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣 like fully had him on ropes and dat apply pressure
Troopz - Please collaborate with Lee Gunner
“Big man ting” Ffs troopz that’s literally what you weren’t supposed to say
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
He's right troops it's the players bruv
brah i swear troopz was about to hit him with the rock bottom.
Yow Troops mind the young kid drop you innuh be careful how yuh a grab the man mike bro bro
0:50 violation😂😂😂
Take your time with it..😁😂😁😂😁😂😁😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Big up troopz
Arsenal became cursed after they back-stabbed Ozil.
Zah right
arsenal fans 😂😂😂😂
As a Gooner i was actually happy Arsenal lost again its just a matter of time Arteta will be sacked
Good to see hornswoogle and boogeyman after such a long time
I thought Hornswoggle was getting bodied by Troopz for a minute
i hope this is staged otherwise tell troopz you cant be speaking to people like that..
Sean Dyche has never won Arsenal. This season under Arteta he did. Brendan Rodgers has never won Arsenal. This season under Arteta he did.  All at the Emirates. Oh, how has the mighty fallen 🤦🏻‍♂️
He fool just rants over all the managers and say him out , what is this guy's purpose , Wenger out then down the rail🤦‍♂️.
Troopz pls come back
Troops looking he is about to slap the guy. 😂😂😂 we are 15th ...
Aubamaowngoalclat yeah 😂😂
HAHAHAHAHA this is peak comedy
is this other guy deluded. mourinho and moyes have had the same time and look at what theyre doing. look up the facts before chatting shit
troopz wont come out at aftv after this ea?
Welcome to the Rat Army Troopz #TapasPulisOut
Think god troops is a smart man
Zah bout to see the real Troopz if Arteta stays much longer
Would have been hilarious if black Wee Man moved the mic just as Troopz went to grab it 😆😆😆
Troops sound arrogant 🤣🤣🤣
This troops guy is a joke
Troopz grabbed the mic off Zah like he was backstage on Friday Night Raw in the late 90’s 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THE cameraman has to stop MOVING
Unless Arteta wants to get sacked, he needs to re-evaluate everything and flip the whole team on its head. Sit Auba! Ozil gets in! Saliba gets in! Kids get in!
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The man too short him a cant given see the garbage we playin
😂😂😂😂😂
When Zah said Arteta in still - troopz was about to say - Arteta in? Is he mad? 🤣
I will never watched again it is so fake and staged! Forget it!
We’re the dead ting in a rave ffs 😂😂🥶
When he grabbed the mic 😂😂😂
Robbies looking different but can’t quite put my finger on it
Troopz have a point Belerin is not good enough he’s past his time and several others player’s in this Arsenal team. But I don’t believe that getting a new manager will not make this team better. I strongly believe that Arteta should a entire season
bringing the attitude era...my G....
Ran out wenger now look!
Big man ting 😂😭
lol The famous Arseanal "supporters" going scripted rant videos now? This looks bad..even this guy is more genuine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_LwskG3gLY
😂😂😂
Arsenal are 15th. 💔
Wrestlmania every weekend
everything that came out of Troopz mouth is facts. No one can argue about it. No one
Troopz he used to be real and his emotions was real, but now it looks like staged comedy!
Mans lost the plot
Hire wenger!!  After 1 season: sack him  Hire emery  After 1 season: sack him  Hire artheta   After 1 season: sack him  This is how arsenal fans rants!!!😂😂😂
Troops really called us the dead ting in the rave nah man in dea at least I can laugh my sadness off😂
Troopz need to respect Zaha more regardless of his opinion tho!!!
The zoom in to the box he’s standing on 💀🤣🤣
Sept: Artekkas Oct: My Manager! Dec: Arteta out!
Did you see the red card Saliba got against Wimbledon? He lunged at a player
I don’t think that The Ozil situation is Arteta fault.  I really believe that Kroenke and the other man are demanding to get Ozil out bc he is way to expensive for the club right now
Troopz bro they got ya arguing with a disabled guy for views you fell in that trap big time. I know the guys a grown man but visuals with you screaming in his face aren't the best mate
Waiting for someone to run in with a steel chair
Budget robbie
Fam troopz about to pull out the steel chair on he’s clart
Troopz is absolutely right.... We all called Bellerin, Xhaka, Holding and Willian not to start against Burnley but Artetas desperation has put those clowns in  and it's backfired.  Cedric and AMN should have definately started, no excuses. Arteta is finished and thank fuck for that.
It’s Horsnwoggle and Finlay.
Xhaka gotta GO
that could NEVER happen to don robbie LMFAO
HOW MUCH did they pay for auba?
Man this is just prime troopz
The real pandemic is at Arsenal.
Eddie Howe is the solution
He legit jug the mic off his hands 😂😂😂 2:30
Neil Warnock
If Arsenal loses to Southampton and zah says “trust the process”, troopz might beat him live
I'd take Harry Redknapp rn even
that camera work is the office-esque
Big Sam ftw!!! LOL....tape his mic to the side of his face, Sam.
Ok, all jokes aside.. This was lit 🔥
0:10 that face turn hahahahahah
i agree with Zah!
No interviewer should have to put up with Troopz’s behaviour. Disgraceful and frustration with Arsenal is no excuse
People with America accent taking about football, it's kinda weird for me 😂. Can't take serious 😀
Pure gold lolllllll
Troopz players are problem and not arteta you ave to know that...arsenal sack arteta and bring new coach same thing happen so long as players are bulshit
Troopz is a real Arsenal man!
Zah is delusional....the manager picks the teams. He rushed back Partey. He orchestrates the tactics and upholds the disciplinary standards.
They make their manager God the one day and devil the next day....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Try Ozil... maybe he can unlock auba
The cameraman is violating he didn’t have to zoom in on the pedestal like that lmao
So easy to say “dead squad”, Auba, Partey, Leno, Gabriel, those three make at least half of the other teams in the league. This team should’ve top 10 MINIMUM. Of course there’s shit players at Arsenal, but there is at every club. So many bad things at your club, but I don’t think the quality of player is correct at all
Fakest shit I’ve ever seen
Funny thing is, fm predicts this every year somehow in each release (on my saves at least) for a few years now, arsenal do alright for a season or two then somehow they fall into becoming a mid table club to only get europa league on the odd occasion when they have a good season but other than that it’s just mid table mediocrity
Great acting lads
Arteta in
I dont get why Troopz doesnt see that the Ozil situation is way over Arteta, it's been going with Emery as well.
Don’t blame arteta, red card couse us the game
Im laughing like a maniac in a crowded silent restaurant... lord bless troopz
I see troopz mad but not like this
Lmfao they did man dirty showing him stood on a platform to interview🤣🤣🤣🤣
troopz needs to be locker room hype man when arsenal are down in the half
Troops you need to calm down when you're in an interview
Can’t take Americans serious when they talk football
WWE vibes for real 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I agree with troopz
Troopz and Zah da best combo😂😂😂😂😂
Take it easy on za man
😂😂😂🙏🏾🙏🏾😂🙏🏾😂
Troopz is electric on the mic
Hahaha muppets aubama who aubama where looool
Artekkers
Clout
😂😂😂😂
Acting
My man, He won't play Europa team with EPL team so he can have more "Excuses"
At least the UKs Ty is honest, the lil guy is just doing it to get views. Shame. As everything in America all fake.
🎶Take Your Time Wit It🎶 😭🤣💀  Auba... Refund Di Ting            GGMU 😭🤣🙏
Who’s the camera man 😭😭😭😭 wallahi he’s going jahannam
When he grabbed the mic I was like "Woah it's getting real now!"
3:02 Well Troopz I mean Ibrahimovic signed for Ac Milan in January this year and they were 12th like 19 points behind a European place and like 30 something points from 1st place. Look at them today. Ac Milan has a leader that motivated them to get back to the top while Arsenal have no leader in their team.
Troopz WWE 😂😂😂
Zah the American Ty😂😂😂😂
When your 5ft6 and scream big man ting in a midgets face
Dt was right, troopz is selling out. This was fully scripted nonsense
This is better than aftv 🤣🤣🤣
Aftv still in your blood with the out, out, out agenda
if Arteta could justify why Ozil is out, or bring Ozil back as soon as possible, then he could be in. Otherwise, please out!
This guy is on here trying to sell his Arteta out shirts and trying to get bar stole some money or hes gone. Fans with a single braincell know its kroneke fault.  Who ever we get managerwise will be gone within a year again like the last 2.
We back this process 😂 just increase the professionalism  and   make them more clinical😌
Troopz isn't a fan. He is what we call a fanatic. He ends relationships over sport.
Should I mention now that Arteta was the reason Gabriel and Partey signed...and they have been our best players.
arteta is a joke... two things fucked up your squad  Ozil decision is haunting the shit out of Arsenal.... Arsenal has been on a speedy decline since they didn't show Martinez the respect he  earn....he fucking won the fa cup and took some shame out Arsenal eye in the league....
haha was waiting for this, Troopz never fails
Realax Arsenal fans you still have 26 more games to go 🙄 😴
Troops you Bully.  No right to grab the mike out of hand and screen shit in his face... ya wrong mate...! Grow up...!
3:34 🤣😂 the accent “” ARRRTTTETTA IIINN”” my guy
I was waiting for the “plan bree” 😂
The Gambian Hornswoggle getting bullied here by the peoples champ
That guy saying money will fix everything 😂 and then troopz using the aquar example 🤣🤣
0:48 LOL the camera man did the interviewer dirty
Can’t lie , he needs to relax with Zah a bit . It ain’t deep but the Yanks dont know troops and it looks Deep. 😬🤷‍♂️ Also it’s a bit jarring , don’t just yell lol
Arsene wenger come back
This is lit🔥🔥🔥
Robbie looks different here...
You remember arsene wenger
We've been waiting for this all night. I can sleep now
Troopz made himself look like a football genius next to this guy, are American fans really that deluded?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.......
I'm predicting Troopz will pick this guy and slam him when arsenal lose again in the next match.
Troopz sacked by Barstool sports moving back the the ends aftv return in a month.
Troops more entertaining than Arsenal
This is a bloke who said arteta was better then Lampard 😂 what a clown
We Finishing 16 Or 17 With Arteta it's not the worst we will be out of Europe  especially Europa and can focus on the league
Arsenal for the league
Boring.. i love troopz in aftv.. much better
why the camera man tilting the camera lol
LONDON IS BLUE
It’s disrespectful that ur just sat there shouting in ur boys face like that rah 😂😂😂
2 transfer windows and its arteta who picked him , and he picks bell-end all the time in the league
8:40 he was shook
ELECTRICITY BLOOD
0:49 nahhhh why did they have to do him like that 😭😭
Dave needs to bring in the fat dude from aftv
Zah is gey
As if anyone in America can understand him. He flew to America to avoid Arsenal and they still make him throw a tantrum on YouTube haha COYS top of the league
Blood in my clot my clot
Is no one going to talk about the camera man panning down on the platform okay ? ....😅 subtle paar there
Man looked scared when that mic got grabbed off him 😂
where is this lil guy from?
If I wake up and he isn’t gone I will personally get him a taxi here and talk him out of our club he has lost control he has torn my club apart   Ozil  Guendouzi Saliba Maitland-Niles All miss handled situations that you would do a lot better job than bellerin,holding,xhaka,elneny/ceballos
Lol. Players frustrated under Unai...frustrated under Arteta. They'll be frustrated under the next manager as well.
The cameraman did the guy dirty when he panned down 😂
This interview is crazy nice 😂😂😂
Arsenal is ass
Remember when özil was the scapegoat, bet he's laughing at Arteta right now (and everyone else tbh!) Maybe özil was the reason we haven't hit 15th until this season.
Finally you're Artetaout. About a year too late
Woolwich got relegated
Nooooo I feel bad for the American guy
0:49 😂😂😂😂😂
5:29 did I hear big Sam 😱
There both short
Cannot believe an american said mandem hahaha what the fuck
grab the mic when zah starts to make a point about laca not putting away an easy chance.... shouting and being intimidating makes you right yeah, fucking freak behaviour mate.
Starting eleven is shit
"We're 15th you fucking wallad" my chest is burning 😭🤣
Electric factory!
Barstool sports licking their lips..use Troopz wisely and you'll coin it
Robbie, tell me the diet you use .
American Robbie knows  how to wind him up, he even has the same box.
🤣🤣🤣 Troopz is f***ing ANGRY
Keep the cam still feels fake
0:51 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
let zah talk ffs
Slowly troopz is turning to prime Claude, reminds me alot of ty claude
Whether you're Arteta in or Arteta out I think we can all agree Americans should NEVER use words like mandem.
Troopz getting mad lol.
2:31 MAN SAID GIVE ME THE MIC BLUD 😂
straight back to the cedric argument LOL!!!
Only a few months ago Troopz was all about Arteta and laughing at Pep   How time flies
Troopz is bullying Zah☹
Bruh what troopz has turned into is embarrassing
Arsenal have two options sack the manager and get poch or spend in Jan and hope it pays off until the end of the season
This is gold😂
2 and a half minutes in, this video earns that like from me
Get rid of arteta period
Trust the process - signed 76ers fans
“You can’t pin Xhaka’s behavior on Arteta”. Of course you can. Players are walking all over him because they don’t fear nor respect him. Pepe got a red card one game and the next match he started for the Europa  squad. The players are untouchable with this timid manager.
Facts. We have 25 players that need to be sold.
Arsenal should apologize to ozil
Arteta in.
Troopz is high. Arteta in.
TY Lannister's moving mad
Arsenal fans need to realise that yes Arteta isn’t the man but YOU HAVE A SHIT TEAM😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️  No manager in the world is making a difference. Managers can’t control what players do on the pitch  You’d think by the amount of Managers they’ve ran through that they’d realise this already
“With youuurr chestttt” 😭🤣
It's kinda weird that everyone under 5' still are Arteta in. Hello, Ty and Zah....
0:49 camera man is takin da piss 😆... I'm done.
troopz is losing it over there. arteta in still
Jokes...troopz will pop him from behind
We more than anything need to replace Arteta and sell, buy our , or not renew the Deadwood at this team.  Then used the youngsters whilst using the subsequent windows to buy players we need. Any new Manager that comes in has to be experienced not interns as we're experiencing now.
SAR is the new Ty!
Troopz needs to come down.  Like dude chill and stop insulting Zah.  Ripping the mic from him is disgusting as well.
Zah is a pretend Arsenal fan. He doesnt known fuck all about football or Arsenal. He doesnt even realize that this is the lowest Arsenal has been since the 50's. Only started watching Arsenal because of Troopz's podcast
Troopz can not talk to a grown man like that
Lol cameraman violated that guy by zooming on the box
Troops mimicking CEC “I’m getting 200 grams at Arsenal......but they’re 15th” 😂😂😂😂😂
Troopz took the mic im dead
Two dreadful actors and a god awful camera man 😂
I want arteta to stay
We should break the team and rebuild from January.  Sell Bellerin, Xhaka, and drop most of the first 11!!!  Rest Auba and Laca for 2 games, play Martinelli and Balegun instead.  Pair Gabriel and Saliba for CB.  It should work or at least give the fans something to be hopeful for.  Arteta... He too stubborn to learn new things, even though he is a newbie Manager!!
Looool bruv arsenal is banter FC now I can’t watch football
This dwarf guy is such a weirdo lmfaooo my guy doesn’t know football what so ever how did they set troopz up with this guy
The fact Troopz thinks aouar would change anything shows how clueless he is.
These guys need to act their age man. I used to rant exactly like this, on the fucking playground. Grow up man develop some coping skills.
He sounds like a white man 😭😭😂😂
WOB all having a shit fit. Hilarious.
aubattyman scores again !!
Fucking Troopz will never show such disrespect to Robbie! He found someone shorter than him and he things he can just push him around and make him feel so inferior? Pick on someone your own size you plum! Big up Zah!
Troopz is a sellout
I wish Troopz was still on AFTV so much good content with Arsenal form rn  😂
Chill the fuck out man. Im pretty sure Arsenal doesnt want fans like you. You have new manager w bunch of bang average players. You guys hopinh from miracles. Im united fan and trust me i know frustration but yours is waaay out of order. Specially when u take xhaka’s side over Arteta
Players are shht but at the end of the day Arterta can not get anything out of the players so he has to go
This is the worst channel I’ve ever seen I used to like troopz at Aftv😂
God bless Zah...no way I could firm being called a wallad 😂😂😂😂😂
Troopz come bac. This channel dead asf
This dwarf is a btec robbie
The camera man needs a slap...what is the meaning of what he did in 0:50
0:48 why did the do my man like that 😂
What gives me jokes is the other guy just taking it like he’s being told off. Zero comeback ! When he let Troopz take the mic out his hand I knew it was a barrage of verbal coming !
I'm in heaven  right now  !! spurs top of the league ! arseanal in a relegation battle  !!!
These players are betting against arsenal to lose
Confiscating the mic was deep
Obama who obama what , where is Obama now ???
0:48 ah man the cameraman didn’t have to do that 🤦🏽‍♂️
Troopz not agreeing with most of what you said still think it's too early for this kind of vibe. You need to show more respect to the 🇿🇼 warrior  as well fam, come on now.
This is some WWE promo backstage lol
Troopz needs to come back to London, this Zah guy is SUS as fk.
'money fixes everything' proper American mentality 😂
Naaa the way the camera man went down to the stool 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ceballos's left boot>ozil
"profiting off a loss" anyone. Rant in the title = instant views
Booker T gave Troopz a great interview
Claude and Ty show, US edition.
Why is Troopz in America? I've been out of the loop
Der Mann hat nh krawatte
This is fucking brilliant 😂
Troopz di Jamaican came out, grab di mic 🎤
0:49 why’s the camera man done that then 💀
Hahahahaha thought troopz was gonna hit him😂😂😂
All fake
This defo has to be staged. It's too good 🤣🤣
Lmao my man really lowerd the camera to show zah on yellow pages
Wegner IN,
troopz gonna drop kick that American ty off his stool 😂
This is a genuinely well constructed comedy skit.
Boring
But the squad has been enhanced with partey and Gabrielle etc
This lit 🤣 am a Barca fan so this is happy to see
3:34 when Troopz started doing Zah impression like he's ET i spat my drink out.
Shit went up another level when Troopz snatched the mic. x)
This channel. Has just upped its levels big time today 😂🤣👌🏾🔥👊🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Yoo troopz scared the shit outta lil dude my God 🙀🙀
Xhaka needs to curb his ego
Scripted interview.. troopz sold out ur dead when ur back in north london Mr tshirt
When u gota lean on to ur lil brother 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
zah and troops make hot tv
This is straight up some WWE shit lmaoo 😂😆
Anyone that says this is acting up for the camera doesn’t know how it really feels to be an arsenal fan right now because off camera we are acting ten times worse than this tonight. Big up troops 4 keepin it real... #PAIN
At home as well.. rubbish now
Feels weird hearing an American say mandem
Arteta chooses the team. Xhaka, has done this crap before and the manager kept him. Whatever happens on the field is all about the manager getting into the players head. Arteta OUT!!!
I hope specs uses this as a memory on ‘remember wrestling’😂
Feel sorry for Zah.
From the claude and ty show to troopz and ty show
Fuck off about that transfer window, Lampard took a transfer ban n got fourth
Damn this is weak, seen your rise all about the hits now even your a1 drooped it. Reflect bro conduct yourself you aint a teen
I swear this lil man is winding up troopz back and forth. Inside and out. You can almost see him holding back a big smile. I dont know if troopz is in on it though.
Mini Ty is Ty
This guy is looking a bit phoney. Can never replace Robbie.
Did I just hear “mini Robbie “ towards the end ,.? 😂
Man picked up the accent a lickle
Loooll when the camera man looked down and lil man was standing on the box I nearly died🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yo anyone notice the quality of the camera 😨 Aftv need to step up there game up
Players, not every player, but some will reject better teams if the bag is better tbf. And they'd wanna live in London.
lol, this guy. Starts the interview with Troopz saying "Arteta In!" ... pass mic. Thats like pulling the pin on a grenade before handing it on to Troopz, lmao
Xhaka shouldn’t of started. That’s arteta’s fault
I BEG YOU BUY ANOTHER MIC looOOL dat guy is doing fucking bicep curls this video
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Robbie looks mad different
my guy is a better wind up merchant than Don Robbie...
Lfmao Arsenal and Arteta are making Ole look like he's doing great
I appreciate Troopz trying sumn new, but these interviews doesn’t seem authentic. It’s clear they are winding up Troopz for a reaction for views and I honestly feel bad for Troopz.
I love seeing Arsenal fans meltdown but wow Troopz took this to another level
Both have a point  that’s the problem we have too many problem  Which will be not solved unless kroenke is out 💆🏻‍♂️ Yall still don’t get it
Wenger was king
Just need xhaka and bellerin to walk in the background and get an rko out of nowhere by troopz 😂👌👍
Sign Pochetino Arsenal must change this fraud Former Assistant manager
Its just about clicks and you man are here clicking or you would not have read this. Mind blown! 😆
Guys,You can believe in JESUS CHRIST now and get saved while there is still time. GOD loves you, The Bible says ''Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'' Mark 12:30 One either loves GOD or loves the world, never both, and the result of loving the world+ the things of the world is death, death in sin , no salvation, rejection by GOD. Are you going to finally get it ? or you keep playing and neglecting the precious LOVE and SALVATION GOD offers through His One and Only SON JESUS CHRIST Our LORD and SAVIOR, who died on the cross to redeem our souls. Please repent and accept JESUS CHRIST, get saved https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g
bro we are still winless since your departure from aftv
I am done Bro with arsenal
F*** trust the process #Artetaout Period we have never seen something like this period
Troopz is hardcore! Give the guy respect cus he fights for his club like a wild beast! Cant ever knock the man for his zest for the club. Fuck it! Give him the job! Least players might actually do something then when he cracks few skulls!
Don’t talk to Americans about football honestly
Some TNA impact interview 😂😂🤣🤣
who is this yank weirdo
That face from troops when he said arteta in 😂😂
Lol i think this blokes psychotic well and truly.
Honestly I would even take back emery over arteta 🚌
Who dis btec presenter 😭🤣
no he panned down to the box hahahahahahaha hows he gonna do him like that proper violation that hahahhaha
Ay troops do not get angry man I have just got in to football. I did not know there was a relegation in English football.
LMFAO! This is hilarious. Troopz snatching the mic from the dude is priceless. Long live Troopz! Straight forward talk right there.
Hate to say this but Troopz has really let this US move get to his head. He is moving mad arrogant and I don't like to see this
The funniest was during the live stream towards the end of the game " Troopz, this is really good pizza"
Camera pans to 📦  Troopz snatches 🎤  Then says Big man ting repeatedly to a dwarf.   This video had it all.
Money isn't everything troopz America is dead 🙄
Imagine if troopz took the mic off Robbie like that! Robbie would have treated him like AJ did pulev with a dirty uppercut haha
I actually feel sorry for this zar coz I like his loyalty and he looks like he just getting told off haha I dont feel sorry for muppets like troops hahaha
Troopz is so annoying nowadays. Too much swearing and screaming it looks all fake, i cant take him serious.
He is right who in right frame of mind would want to join Arsenal in 15 position with an unknown manager. Players ego are more frustrated playing for an unknown manager.
3:16 v the rock
When man opens his mouth to talk at 3.15 but can’t muster the words I was dying 😂😂😂
I would sack Arteta if we’re getting a world class manager but not for an average manager or on Artetas level.
This guy talks a load of crap. When troopz said he,d rather see Cedric than bellerin, why did he try and make out that troopz was only judging him on the Dundalk game. Cedric,s 10 x better than bellerin
ah americans pretending to be football fans haha
Troopz absolutely frightened TY son ffs 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
For once Troopz actually makes a good point - who would honestly sign for them now? And also, who could they actually sell to bring in money and who would even want to buy these players?  It’s not as simple as get rid of the old players and get new ones, it has to be a gradual process. If your the owner what makes more sense? Get a whole new XI because the manager has lost faith in all of them, or get a new manager who could actually get something out of the players they have.
You lot are mad at Troopz for profiting from Arsenal's downfall, but most of you let this absolute joke of a club sell you dreams and screw you over every season. If you still buy Arsenal products, you may as well join a cult
I have american accent and I do not approve american accent in this tv it just is offfff
Troopz still nothing about heavy d. It was down to you
0:55 Americans can’t say Mandem 😂😂
Troopz man this ain’t you, you’ve changed
Bloody hell I knew Troopz was small but how small is Zah?😂😂
Robbie the GOAT but Michael Cole 2.0 pretty decent
Arteta is not the problem at arsenal you can see he wins with young players in europa. It's the mature players having issues with the arteta it seems
Arteta In
185k muppets, I mean subscribers for this crap?
Trust the process...  The process is stress 😤
This is tooo funnny 😂😂 trooopz  15th  Man Utd 4life
I'm actually dying. the dwarf is on a box and troopz took his mic from him and said "big man thing".
Just have boxing match already
Troops raging! Imagine what he’d be like aubamayang didn’t score.
Lol when troopz grab the mic...🔥🔥🔥🔥
How can zah say he inherited a shit side he has a squad that is better than what emery had and emery did better with a worst squad. Also money solves the problem aye. Is that why arsenal have spent more than Chelsea last 16 years and spent more than Liverpool and are 2nd highest spenders the last 7 years. Excuses for arteta isn't even funny anymore
Wtf can’t they afford 2 microphones  Fighting over a mic lol
I saw the fear in the guys eyes and saw fear when troopz took away the mic
Tna impact back stage.
Lol I was laughing so hard this interview
It was a good movie,It even had a scenario when the guy takes the mic :-D
Salivas never been better then Wesley fofana he’s chatting shit
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Was waiting  for an RKO out of nowhere
Over at AFTV so deluded that they can get a manager like ponch to come in lol
oh man, I miss Troopz, LMAO
Arteta out. I don't understand why we cant use a team of Laca, Auba, Ozil, Saka, Elneny, Cedric, Gabriel, Mari and Maitland Nies/Saliba/Tierney.
If Arsenal keep losing their coming games definitely Troopz you going to get sick
Considering Lyon just beat PSG and have a chance of winning the league, Aouar isn't leaving Lyon
#zahout
You have been relegated
On a real, if Troopz was a wrestler his Promo skills would be a madness. Mans spitting like rock
0:48 looooooooooool
I know some aspects of the interview was scripted but it was jokes still
We're 15th you fuckin wallad 😂😭😂😭😂
Troops you already become americanized, keep the interview real!
Love the new camera... clear AF
Come on Barstool, get man a studio!!
Troopz found Rastafari Ty in New York. what a day ......
he's right money cannot fix this one,
Greatest WWE promo ever🤣. Only thing missing is for DT to jump him from behind in a epic heel turn🤣
0:48 The camera man is naked the little hidden🤣🤣
We will lose to south hampton on wednesday..i wonder what kind of excuse arteta will hve then, those man are fourth on table and playing some serious ting..
You need a better camera man, moved to much,I’m looking for a job ?🙏🏼
Nah man that’s vio. How the camera man showing footage of down below😭👎🏽
Maybe if we get relegated to the Championship then Kroenke will sell the club
No offence to this guy i give this guy props for interviewing troopz but this guy is american version of don robbie 😂😂
Zah..."thats your guy" dwl lmao
If Arsenal relegate to Championship maybe he has a chance to win a tournament...again
I feel like troopz will pickup that guy a punt him across the room
Troopz thinks no players will come but Allegri will.  lol. Arsenal need to wipe away this season, stay up and rebuild looking for next season.  Manager must go, bring in someone like Big Sam to ensure safety in the PL.
Dave portnoy is a genius
arsenal fan tv is the funniest shit ever
who appointed an inexperienced Arteta? simple
Blind loyalty.. auba who auba whaa auba he’s playing fucking shit!
Troops, I know you are in the states dont try so hard  you ain’t in London with robbi and all  keep it authentic blood we appreciate that better.
0:47 VIOLATED MY MAN NO
We are not attractive any more , we are a mess as a club in whole.
Nah troops Dooo one! Aubameyang has previous blah blah nahhh duck that. Wenger had previous and won titles for us but once he start doing shit you were wenger out! LOOL auba is not your son or brother to be backing like that! Piss off and call him out! He’s scored more own goals then against teams at home. Piss off
The way he snatched the mic with so much venom 🤣
I felt like troopz was gonna say, " I spoke to my mum last night and she said she's arteta in... IS SHE MAD?!! "
This american TY is more smarter,calm and less cringe than the British TY lol.
With their current form. I could genuinely see Arsenal not winning again until January.
A new manager may not fix all d Shit but he can Save u lot from RELEGATION.
troopz looking like his bout to RKO this guy
I thought troopz was going to rko the guy yo
You can tell Troopz only went here for New York. This Channel has 1/4 of the subs that AFTV has + you ask any American if they know what Barstool is or AFTV they'll say AFTV lol
Ty in a wig
Zah speaking facts
I guess your mum wasn't mad after all, Wenger in.
all this stress has shrunk robbie
Midget man is there to wind up troopz
00:45 .... Ya have been relegated before (1912-1913) and ya actually bought your way back into the 1st Division 👍 Your history should be totally different.
Here is the players play for they play for Ozil.
What is troopz talking about?! Of course more money convinces most players to come
Zah out
Ozil be like 😌
Not watched Troopz since he left. What am I watching 😂 I love it,
That dwarf is like 'No, no, no' to Sam Allardyce but the sad truth is that Arteta is a bloody Noob as a manager. Big Sam would be an upgrade over Arteta anyday of the week. Not saying that you go for Big Sam as manager but any Arsenal fan still defending Arteta is a delusional idiot. The writing is on the wall in big bloody letters, sack Arteta before it actually becomes a relegation fight come the end of the season.
Ty got real small all of a sudden
Is this a skit? Might be wrong but this doesn’t seem genuine. Good cop bad cop routine to fuel a rant and get views...
Troopz turned on arteta so quick, the man was dancing against Man United to selling arteta out shirts
Arteta out Emery in 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Too drama troopz 🤮
Enough Arteta, we want a new coach who could be Allegri, Hui or Pocinho
Why troopz shouting at the little guy
This is WWE!
American ty winding up troopz 😂, never seen troopz this aggressive and angry before tho
Arteta out bro
It's time to go out artata and then back arson, Wenger.
All I see when someone says they still back Arteta is someone who is okay with mediocrity and has no desire to see their club move forward. Weak embarrassing mindset.
Arsenal should sack arteta now? 🤔 “ tek ur time wid it....”
A whole lot more what??? Arteta as mismanaged the players, he is confused the guy is fucking up the club. Guenduzi should never have left why buy a player for almost 30m and not include him in the squad lastly for over a month now he has picked the same players with no results what is going on with arteta i like him but it is a results business.
Someone tell my man with the camera to stand still wtf
Scripted - fake
Why troopz being a dick to zah?
For a minute I was worried for the lickle man
So no one's gonna mention Troopz turning Indian at 3:00 🤣🤣🤣
troopz is gonna launch this guy through a window one day.
The 1 transfer window reason is lame. Ozil is in the team, yet Arteta doesn’t use him.
Troopz bro I love you but have some respect and don’t be snatching the mic from him like that
omg this is gold 😂😂
Anyone else getting WWE interview vibes? 😂
Troopz shouting like this shows how plastic this fan base is
Arteta out!!!
Troops needs to come back to UK. These Americans don’t know what they’re talking about
He lost the dressing room when arteta took full responsibility on the Özil fiasco
Man said YOU FUCKING WALLAD😭
So staged
This cameraman have to show leg standing on a wooden box
I think Arsenal need to appoint this Southampton coach before Borussia Dortmund does.
holy shit this guy is actually worse than ty
What’s the guy saying??? Arteta is in over his heads. Something is wrong and Arteta is what is wrong! How come Bellerin and Xhaka are in the team? We will be relegated if Arteta is still in charge next game I promise you. Arteta out tonight
KronkeOut....changing managers is a circle chair......average dead squad
Why he always say blood 😂😂😂
I agree with Troopz. I would take Sam over Arteta all day long!  Arteta was never proven. He was a coach in the top team in the prem how does that equate to him even being a good candidate for the Arsenal manager job? He was a cheap alternative. Nothing more.
THE SQUAD IS JUST MEDIOCRE!!! ARTETA is inexperienced and i did not expect much from dude. TAKE THIS L and start investing in Quality players and sack these useless bumms out of the squad.
This presenter is brilliant
Troopz and TY-nee!
I think Arsenal appointed an inexperienced manager way too early. Let him prove himself a lil bit in a small team just like Lampard before you appoint him, he will get better but that will lead to painful times
Im sorry but tryna listen to Americans talk about football is the cringiest thing on earth
Calm down blud 🤣
As much as I love troopz. Hes WRONG for telling Zah it doesn't hurt him as much as it hurts for troopz. Fucked tbh
Ty drank a magic potion
im sorry but saliba is not better than fofana
Wenger out!
Lol if arsenal are not top 10 fella then 15th is about right!!!
Not fair when Troopz says big man ting to this guy
Getting mad over men that don't even pay his bills.
Tatu shit himself when Troopz grabbed the mic
Troopz why be employed by these muppets embarrassing
Bellerin is in the team because Arteta is too sentimental. He loves Bellerin like a son. He even let him live with him and his family.  Arteta is a shit manager. Arteta out or Arteta in? He should never have been in, in the first place.
I've missed these melt downs
The cameraman 😂🤣🤣🤣...... And Troopz scared the shit out of Zah, I was scared  too lol he may push him.
Might not get the views but this is one of the best interview from troops 🙌🙌😂
Nahh Troopz RKO that brudda into that box he is standing on  .  Rahhh what is this
Getting Michael Cole interviewing Vince McMahon vibes from this
Fuck the process, wenger in
Barnsley v Arsenal next year
Za lowkey finna quit after dis 😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA BANTER FC
Did my man just say big man ting to lickle man? he doesn't know how it feels to be a big man!
These goons are just acting to add spices....trying to make it WWE....
Sell xhaka bellerin lacazette ozil eneny holding mustafi bring in william carvalho, isco,saint maximim, tavanier and yes Eric bailly would improve a weak willed squad
American Ty is more delusional than Ty
2:26 Troopz: "nononono. nonononono". lol arsenal fans are all south park characters.
Social distancing??
*WELCOME TO MONDAY NIGHT RAW!!!*
Liccle mans got no clue
its sad hes cashed out for this shit
troopz we goona win europa league yo
THE CAMERAMAN LMAOOOOO
Telling your kid off 🤣
Omds he's actually Ty
Wow Robbie has gone small and finally grew some hair
The rock and hornswoggle
The problem wit Arsenal is the player it self come on guy you got to play good to win games and only deaths players are right now playing for Arsenal keep the young sale d rest
Sell deadweight at this club although troopz is right who would take them
Lool I love these two 😂😂😂😂😂
These two are embarrassing 🙄
Troopz needs to come back to London, immediately!
Arteta got rid of Toreira, Sokratis, Guendouzi and quarantined Ozil, he thinks showing muscles is what a manager is all about, he is good only at polishing Pep's shoes.
Troopz don't push him off that standing tool oo, it is very dangerous
Issa Classic.
Don robbie will need to get the 💰 out to get these 2 to aftv😂 new claude and ty
I'm sick of all the dikkheads scapegoating Bellerin everytime. He's playing right wing-back and not as a right back blame Arteta for it.  Tierney is the worst leftback I have ever seen play for the Arsenal from Sansom to Monreal.  He hasn't got one ounce of intelligence in his game except charging down and whipping in shots for crosses instead of crossing the ball low.  Arsenal isn't know to be an aerial team since the George Graham days.  Holding Willian Xhaka Leno and Auba are all terrible.  I swear to God if I hear Dt saying Leno was better than Martinez ever again I'm going to personally make him a man-whore and allocate him a street.  We are in a relegation battle.
Wenger in
Cedric stoped playing because he couldn't cross to save his life, there were even stats going around by the time and troops now wants him for that lol
Ozil in, Arteta back to Etihad to polish Pep's shoes, that's what he's good at
He grabbed the mic because its Troopz TV
This is stupid shit.
Real talk: You wouldn't have snatched the mic out if Robbie's hand like that bro..... Respect your co host Troops
Kroenke is a cancer. Arteta is a puppet just like Emery and Wenger. Arsenal fans deserve better and that starts right at the top with the owner. He does not give a sh4t about doing anything at Arsenal.
This is peak arsnaaa
Im laughing out loud
Yooooo 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Troopz is gonna sock zah if he isn't careful
Zah looks like he got caught cheating by his teacher and listening to him 😂
New country same old Troopz
Come back to AFTV troopz
They taking the piss how this man making my man standing on a stool 🤣🤣🤣🤣...Vile🙈
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😀😀😀😀😀
Troopz is right and the Rock could not give a better promo.
This dude talking about players frustrated... are they not getting paid every week? Pls tell me what’s frustrating them. 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz is right and the Rock could not give a better promo.
Troopz is right and the Rock could not give a better promo.
Troopz is right and the Rock could not give a better promo.
Arteta out to night
This guy must be ty’s twin
Troopz is right
Jesus this troopz is a bellend, the guys getting too heated over this team. Mate the players dont give a shit what you think or say!!!
Good ebening Arsenal
Troopz is right on so many levels 😂😂😂
Big man thing. Is troopz saying he is a short man thing. 🙄
Don't know how long this show may last.  Out of the box, very amateurish,
Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It!    Won the league at Old Trafford! Won the UEFA Champions League at Molde FK. Soooooooo  Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It! Take Your Time With It!
Troopz is a meme but in this vid, he is speaking absolute facts. Wake up arsenal!!! It’s MID DECEMBER!!! Emery was better than this guy and that’s the scariest part
Yanks dont know shit about football
My respect for Little man📈📈📈  my respect for troopz📉📉📉
Couldn’t make out if this was a wind up or not 🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
This is pay per view stuff.
Lol, can’t take this Zah guy seriously. He doesn’t know anything about football. The accent as well, lmao, sounds like he should be a basketball analyst or commentator.
The way he snatched the fucking mic, I’m CRYING 😂😂😂😂
' You would rather see Miguel Azeez ?🤨' Zah is too funny 😂😂
Arsenal has fans arguing with each other 🤦‍♂️
Zah's trying to play devils advocate but hes just doing it blindly to wind up Troopz rather than actually make good counter arguments. It doesn't really work. It's hard to defend Arteta after that Burnley performance. This loss is definitely on Xhaka though, shocking complete lack of thought and devastating lack of discipline especially given the moment this club is in, which makes it far worse. but Arteta shouldn't have played him in the first place, nor Bellerin nor Willian who have all been underperforming, Xhaka and Bellerin look incredibly vulnerable in this system. Maitland Niles, Reiss Nelson and even Willock have all shown much better, which just seems to be a trend at this point of mis man management. At the end of the day our midfield is genuinely shambolic bar Partey. Arteta made his own bed by not registering Ozil and sending Guendozi on loan while failing to bring anyone in (bar Partey). It's difficult to see how Arteta can turn this thing around.
Zah giving Troopz the stare down, like hes gonna lay a Stone Cold Stunner on his ass. 🤣
Relegation Fc bruv. I mean blud
You know something is wrong when you hear “Cedric can cross”
Arsenal FC, this reminds  me of the way Leeds  United  went, nobody  seen it coming.
Can't call zah a wallad..
Troopz was out of line this whole show with Zah. Be emotional, but he professional. Just makes him look stupid. And he actually had plenty of valid points. Grabbing the mic was a bit much.
Zah and white man yardie   u know robbie and troopz on that comedy ting
How this American trying to disregard troopz opinion a loyal fay
How he grabbed the mick
Someone tell Kroenke tanking doesn't work in the Prem
This is comedy gold 😂
He is right. No player is going to come into this team if they are 15th in the January transfer window and have a manager who has never managed a team before. Also, the fans blaming players, are you saying Aubameyang is not a better striker than Benteke who is above Arsenal? Players need to feel connected with the manager and have a relationship that makes them bring out the best in them every game. Players would die for managers like Sir Alex Fergusson. They would never question him and would try to impress him to stay in the team. Bellerin and Xhaka have played abysmally and they are still in the starting XI. Why would they fear Arteta? They are starting every game anyway. They are getting their wages anyway. They got nothing to lose. The players need to either love their manager like Liverpool players love Klopp or they at least need to fear their manager who will be ready kill their career if they make stupid mistakes that cost the team the game. These players don't respect Arteta and that's why they will never do their best to win.
loveeeeeee ittt
Trooopzzzzzz hhhhhhh
"Were 15th you fkin........." what did he call him,i couldnt tell?
TY: dread me, run from me, destiny still arrives..or should i say...ty arrives ><
Troopz needs to respect man wtf is this here nahhh
Hhhhhhhhhhh
This is what i subscribed for
I told you don’t mess with the Muslim ozil he’s prayed that something bad happens to arsenal
U went to America and we went to relegation
Just waiting for Goldberg to smash through that door.
Best thing in WWE right now! 😂
Azeeeeezy
Oh please Zah, get real......coach picks the side, he coaches the gameplay, and the lineups and strategy are all him. The coach takes the credit for FA cup, own your mediocrity
This fool is standing there shouting in his friends face over a game of football and a difference in opinion lol
Real talk Troopz....some Arsenal fans daydreaming, hoping and praying...
When Zah says that’s your guy about aubamayeng I was done 😂
The new version cole interviewing the rock
Hopefully Southampton win their next game.
WWE at its peek
Ozil has been dropped because of him speaking out on his views against the Chinese government’s treatment of Muslims, no one mentions this as a reason. I don’t understand why, do your research it’s there to be seen.
Football is politics no ways, how do these guys work together? 😂😂😂😂😂
Arteta out
Troopz is literally bullying that guy
Yall should sign Buendia and get Ozil in the squad, from a Liverpool fan
Zah love you man you speak truth this players are not good we just need to chill together we go out of this
I'm actually felt scared for the guy Troopz is talking to, even he looked scared at some point lol
Troopz getting mad  standard but reigning it back somewhat then- YOU FUCKIN WALLOD! 😅😅
As staged as I suspect it is, that shit is uncomfortable to watch.
Arsenal fans at the beginning of the season was toxic they deserve all this banter 🤣🤣🤣 thinking use were gonna be contenders 🤣🤣🤣 look at your bludklart now 🤣🤣🤣 arsenal who arsenal what arsenal crumbling ting 🤣🤣🤣
Suprised troopez hasn't picked him up and thrown him out the window
Troopz , you should check on auba fr. He doesn’t seem himself... I’m honestly worried about his mental health
Its true...sack the manager and get the shit players out before too late..
0:50 don't dead mee
Shit. At 2:31 I thought Zah was about to get Pulev'd.
This guy finding out how troopz is looool
Camera pans down on the midgets box he stands on camera man doing a mad violation on him. Raaahhh
Troopz I feel you bro but by kind to the man he looked genuinely shook when u gripped that mic
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hahahaha. Welcome to the partey Troopz.
Troopz isn't making sense man he's a lil too reactionary. If you get a new manager I don't think they can do much more with the players you have. Arsenal are rotten in the core and an overhaul is needed not patchwork cos that's the reason they're in the place they're in now
Arsenal are in a real mess
Why is the camera man showing the stool?  LOL
Arteta oooooout !!!! If you smeeeeeeeeeeell what troop is cooking 🤨 lol
Troopz is loosing his s**t!! But he’s not wrong !!😑
Sam Allah Dyce !
The way your talking to your colleague is so disrespectful, you can have passion for football but don’t lash it out on others
2:31😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
rant seems staged and scripted. we need OG Troops from AFTV
Troops needs to head back to London fam
Love to see Arsenal fans in turmoil lmao
Troopz disrespecting man like Za with that mic grabbing
Troopz must regret leaving uk, this whole American thing feels like an act.
You said 2-0 with your chest... With Your CHEST🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Couldn’t they have just got Zah to stand on the actual stairs instead of some random box?  Also, why does remind me of D’lo Brown being interviewed on Sunday Night Heat before he challenges for the European Title against Ken Shamrock?
Troops was traumatized my the result thats why he grabbed the mic ok
Whoever the camera man is that showed zah standing on a pedestal is going hell🤣🤣🤣
Dwl sorry for these Arsenal fan
Troopz be like I will take Sam Allardyce lol😂😂🤦
Boys your audio is clipping hard on the stream and this fan cam. Back off the levels. There is a hella lot yelling hahahaha
Nahhh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🧐😂😂😂😂 im CRYIN ✋theyre taking the piss out ere 😂😂😂 The cameraman's a fucker 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 DEAD
Troopz relax on zah man ffs bro.

Fam, your opinion doesn't matter anymore
😂😂😂😂😂 YO THIS MAD FUNNY😅😅😅😅😅 15TH WHO'S GOING TO SIGN 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅

TY said he has a twin brother and they don't look alike. We have found him in USA
who gives a fuck what u think u were the one to get Wenger out how u are happy now
Man was shook when Troopz took the mic off him😭😭
This is the fakest of the fake channels.
Arsenal been the dead thing in the rave for years
Zah’s like ‘ I’M ON NEW LEVEL!
you have not seeing any yet you remember you say his better than Frank lampard hnmmmn so what is happening now
you have not seeing any yet you remember you say his better than Frank lampard hnmmmn so what is happening now
Ty lite 🤣🤣
Troopz was about to push that guy off 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ... deluded... we the mandem that go home alone with a cab!
Anyone else feel that Troopz will return to London eventually, I don't think he can hack these yanks. This guy interviewing him is  a fool.
Arteta a scapegoat, the same person who willingly plays bellerin and xhaka. That is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard😭
Bro uno that Leicester centre back is one of the best in the league now
Troopz went fully roadman when he grabbed the mic!
I mean TROOPZ is right who is going to sign for Arsenal 😂😂
Troopz is deffo going American Jail for Murdering 2ft Ty
Troopz looks like he about to shank someone
Trust the process
Man I feel bad for Zah. Atleast Troopz has something going for him 😢
I agree with you bro Arteta should leave
Arsenal finishing 15th
Trust the damn process.
Troopz just come back home maybe we might just win a game 😅😂
Pantomine. Please call Social Services hahahha. This is bullying
this is just a damn show.
Troopz talks like a tough guy but when was the last time he threw an actual punch or got in a fight.
Quality content 🤣🤣🤣
Why did the cameraman expose the interviewer height?
Bet Troopz wouldn't take the mic off Don Robbie like that
This felt like the Jamaican version of Finlay and Hornswoggle
I hope u said sorry to him for grabbing the mike like that ...he made some good points U can not disrespect  him like that
This is so funny man looooooll 🤣🤣🤣🤣 seems like man lyk troops is gonna floor the midget
DDT zah into the metal gate WWF Style he is deluded
Ty 2.0
Troopz thought he had escaped Ty when he moved to the states            Sike 😂
Zah has the most typical American accent I've ever heard😂
Just expecting Wenger to pop out with a chair shot to Troopz head...
This camera man is a savage😂😂
RIP TO MIKEL ARTEKKERZ 😂

The with ur chest is one of the best thing troopz has ever said😂😂 3:40
Money Won’t Solve this Bruhv 🤦‍♂️😁😂
Hi troopz, just wanted to say i am a big fan of your work. Keep up the good work buddy
How far away is he
What a promo by Troopz
This isn't even nice to watch, leave the little dude alone
Troopz is ready to RKO him out of no where lol
Troopz with more heart and passion than the whole of the football club. Put him in charge and the team would surely get in gear. He’d give the players a proper John Sitton style bollocking. We’re the Arsenal for fuck sake, this current form ain’t good enough and hasn’t been for years.
Why did troops leave afc tv,?
Camera man need to come up closer and film better
Loool ita funny coz  troopz wasn't speaking to Robbie like that... dickhead
Zah kinda rarted not gonna lie.
Get this new TY a headphone and then slap him as hard as you can
0:50 LMAO!!!! Camera man is wrong for that!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
TROOPZ i rate you but don't do likkleman like that AND snatch the  mic...Respect haffa run...You would never disrespect Robbie or dT  in that manner so low it cuz...big up the channel
“That’s your guy”😂😂😂
Sacking mikel arteta and selling fringe players won't help anything the whole club should be dissolved
Arteta in hahah  London is blue
Big Sam we Believe
HAHAHAHHA THEY ZOOMED IN ONTO THE BOX
Stop play Willian
Why did the cameraman LOOK DOWN?? Disrespectful
Not the camera man moving the camera down 😂😂shmdgdhdhfstg
Willian no good
ahhhhhh this is gold! :D
3:00 guys like ‘can I have my mic back please?’😂😂
Aubama who???? Aubama what???
Dortmund know what they are doing, Arsenal are keeping everything the same. It has been 3-4 years with the same team. Nothing has changed, 0 improvement and the choices Arteta has been making very bad , bad choices and it keeps hurting the team.
Dead ting in the rave.
Troopz picking on a small man what a guy hhhhh back again banter FC
Cringe
I lost it when he snatched the mic big man ting 😂😂😂
Troops  sam allardyce hell  no 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was agreed with Troopz but now i think  Arteta should resign himself if i were him.By play xhaka and bellerin and some shockin subs.Arteta is lost,Arteta should resign or Sack him.And Ozil situation,Saliba not playin,so much bullshit...
"there is no light at the end of a tunnel." 😁😁"
I thought I’d tuned into tots tv
Troopz sorry but the ott staged emotional everything now w a midget scripted usa dude w oppo viewpoints for controvery it dont work like that near last but then seen from 3rd cam a tiny bit back w donm robbie screaming an just fake scrambling up pogo mosh pit fake look but on 3rd cam u were not touching it was all james bond punches that really miss by a foot . youve sold your soul to go out there and you'll never get it back. you need to force them to allow you to fly in diff fan tv people n sdo live links w all of it to authentithize the ne w dudes n football less atmosphere that usa [aka all usa inc sioccer matches is a non football atmosphere cos they dont even like soccer over asll their crap sports.
Cedric?
Arteta our when he’s signed barley any players can’t get dead wood out and is just starting if we get an attacking player who can create well be able to get play better
Im a united fan but troopz is class lol!
So this is The unidentical twin Ty was talking about
This is class 😂😂😂
Troopz scared me by taking the mic
Troops has done a 180 in a month mikel artekas
Ty looks way taller in this video
Michael arteka
Troopz needs to WATCH how he addresses Chief Keef
OMG fight for the mic 😂
Tiny Ty got big man Troopz on ropes 🤣 blood pressure on rocket
Burnley. Burnley football club?! Wtf wow get OUT ARTETA
Lmao😂😂😂😂😂
American TY presenting 😂
This has been the best video I’ve seen in a long time . Dt sounded intelligent . As he was not using the blood this and that
It is a lucky 1 point against Leeds!!
I guess troopz’s mum being Wenger In is not as bad as it turned out to be
The co-host is annoying
Yes, it's easier to get rid of the manager. But the squad has very little quality, particularly in midfield. There's no depth. The feel good wins in the Europa League won't translate to the Premier League because Arsenal just aren't a physical side. Troopz mentioned that Arsenal can't buy an entire side? Chelsea brought in Havertz, Mendy, Werner, Silva, and Chilwell in one window. Almost all of these players are impact players. Also, if they sack Arteta, who does Arsenal think they're going to go out and get? Mauricio Pochettino? I don't think so.
Zha don’t know much abt arsenal!!! We are tired of arteta because he keeps playing the player which aren’t preforming!! We got nothing to lose now why don’t he play youth... I am brilliant percent sure AZ, Wilco, balgon, smith will show more spirit on badge and club
Calm down stone cold.
You say against Dundalk! Is Burnley that big a team! It is just Burnley!! Try them in Burnley & give them a chance & let us see. It is exactly same first 11 against Tottenham from last week except injured Partey!
Bro, you must respect Troopz man. He mean business when it comes to arsenal. How can we still back Arteta after losing this much games? I trust in Aubameyang and I believe he will return to his goal scoring form when Arteta leaves. He is really frustrated.
Aubama-who?Aubama-what? Aubama-BUMBUCLAT-yang
The guy on the left is just trolling troopz for the reaction 😂
Black Tyrion
Give him time, that’s what’s wrong with this modern game projects need time ⏰ everybody’s so quick to sack with poor results  it’s just gonna be a Manager merry-go-round .
Lingard wouldn't even come to Arsenal 🤣🤣. You can have Phil Jones and Rojo
Man nearly fell off the stool when troopz grabbed the Mic loooooool
Arteta has been poor but today was not his fault. Xhaka has to take full responsibility for today’s defeat. So so disappointing.
0:48 the cameraman did not have to American TY like that
You should  blame aubamyang for his weak performance
Bruh zahs triceps are mad btw
The way za says "arteta in" at the start. Absolute troll. Too funny hahaha
OUT
You can’t sell 25 players, so Arteta has to go😂😂😂
ARSENAL FOOTBALL CLUB FALLING APART HAHAHAHAHA
Come back to AFTV
WWE like superstars
0:05 I FELTH that look man
Arteta is a manager, NOT A PE TEACHER 😂😂😂😂 how times have changed
Zah shat himself when troopz grabbed the mic🤣🤣
Troopz is funny but he brought some serious points this is my covid cure ong I love this ish and I dont support Arsenal
Zah basically getting paid to get screamed at at this point 🤣🤣
This mini TY doesn’t know anything about arsenal lol
Troopz he was winding you up my guy. This guy is smart
Nice ott exaggerated reaction from. Troopz... Barstool paying him for this. Fair play
When troopz took the mic it was like an angry dad and his son 😂😂😂😂😂
Let's be fair before the red card arsenal were playing well and should had been 2 nil up
I think arsenal will fight to stay in the league there fixtures are going steep
😂😂😂😂
Troopz is real. Arteta stays and we are on course to get relegated
Why don’t they just get a second mike
The violation from camera man.. why u gotta do zah like that and show him standing on a box 🤣🙈
These are the dead players we have. (1)Bellerin   (6)holding (11)Kolasinac  (2)Lacazette(7)Willian (12)Luiz (3)Mustafi (8)xhaka   (4)Sokratis  (9)Enelny (5)Chambers (10)maitland niles
Damn it's getting so bad troopz is bullying a midget
Little man is proper delusional
2:28. Fought there was gonna be a fight  🥊 🥶🤣
Arteta In, sign him up to a lifetime contract
Chill on Zah...
Troops taking talking to him like a dad telling his kid off for pissing the bed 😂😂😂
Hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....I am so relieved I can share my sorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Troopz destroying this Zah-s job loooooooooooool
We are 15th u FUCKING WALLAD😂😭
Robbie looks different
Tropz standing tall 👌 what size is tropz by the way 4ft 10 because he's barely taller 🤣 were closer to the bottom than the top, think both of ya are 🤣 big man thing, the irony...
Please tell Zaa to be real.... Ozil is laughing at the team right now. #Arteta Out
Bring Paulo di canio or roy keane in
I bet you this guy also does the BLM gesture during every match
spurs top of the league ... arsenal relagation battlee LOOOOOOOL 😭😂😂😂😂😂 LOCE THISS
TY’s twin bro
Troopz has officially sold his soul since coming to barstool sports doesn’t care anymore only for the money
I didn't know ty left for the land of America too
Need my guy ozil back. He's loving life at the moment
feel sorry for zahh lol hes shook
Fight 👊🏽👊🏽 Fight 👊🏽👊🏽 troopz is literally going to kill him 😂😂😂 !!!! Peak Troopz though I missed him a lots
When Troopz took the mic off Zah,he just went silent lyk ooh this shit is real,the Cam guy just decided to show us how tall was zah lmaoo
Haha Troopz keeping it real. . But Arsenal are a joke club and done out here
Troopz you need to find a man like Robbie who knows the job who knows to ask not always asking s**t on interview
This team is unmanageable.. that’s what the pundits said.
well this is a little different to robbie interviews lol
Zah looks shook after man sucked him 4 da mike 😂😂😂😂
Bellerin can’t cross a road
I think some of AFTV mandems will have mental break downs and we should be worried about them!
Props to the camera guy. This interview is so Murica 🤣🤣🤣
Arteta doesn’t believe mesut isn’t good enough the club have told him to not pick him cos of the China situation are people really that stupid ???🤔🤔
Love how the camera man looks down to see him standing on the stool, why is that got anything got to do with the interview
Is this a joke? Just because you talk loudly don’t mean you talk sense. Cedric is better than Bellerin. What a fool!
Someone come grab Ty's lil brother
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"arteta in"
Why is cameraman violating with filming the stool mans standing on 😂😂😂
Zah: This win takes burnley out of the relegation zone. Therefore we didn't lose to a relegation side
When a small guy like troopz feels like his the big man in the room 😂
“We’re 15th you wallad” 🤣🤣🤣
Troopz has changed man, uste to be my favourite but the stuff hes coming out with aint his words you can tell
Troops as fucking killed him with words classic did get you on Abu been you guy
Yo is xhaka planing to do a choke slam or what ??
I like the midget guy still
Knew this Zah guy was tapped when I saw him don a Nkeita Kit. Must have had an Iwobi one too ffs
Zah really believes this squad is the 15th worst in the league?
Big man ting but mans talking to a dwarf 😂
This is one of the greatest heel promos of all time.
Bullshit troopz u said wenger out how'd that work out A!!!!! Clueless
TAKE YO TIME WIT IT!!!!!
loooooooool
Mans took the mic with no remorse
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Zah is my guy still, fuck Arteta
Troops u r gradually becoming a fool ..
Troopz cutting that backstage promo WM19 just before the main event
Troops u r gradually becoming a fool ..
özil
😂😂😂 this is gold
Troops I give you shit but on this one bang him out please
Arsenal have spent the second most amount of money in world football in the last 2 years. In the last 4 years, arsenal have only spent £30m less than Liverpool, and look at the difference in teams. The problem is the recruitment. On top of that, arsenal fans were giving the transfer window 7 and 8s out of 10 when they signed partey on deadline day. Arsenal fans are a confused bunch 😆
Troops u r gradually becoming a fool ..
Zah man it's not good enough mate it's not good enough for arsenal you guys are actually in the relegation zone it's panic mode
I agree we are heading down it will be like Leicester winning the league but the opposite
2:31 Zah thought his life was over 😂
Troopz like many fans you're reactive. Willock has been our best performer in the Europa, had a couple starts in PL and was poor. Didn't take his chance, Azeez we've seen for 20ish minutes whilst looking good was against opposition not on the same level as PL clubs. Same with Reiss Nelson. Arteta is making mistakes yes but the players are clown and our board left Arteta out to dry by not providing him with a creative player in window, where's the experience or help for Arteta? Even if he is out of his depth and should go do you trust the board to appoint the next coach and get it right? Who emplyed Arteta to manage Arsenal? Kroenke. Wake up and smell the coffee ffs
They need to get Troopz his own mic
We’re 15th you fucking wallad, money ain’t fixing nothing 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Troops u r gradually becoming a fool ..
Within a year he’ll be back in england. Blokes a melt
#Allegri in 💯
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the american mini Ty winding him up. Troopz suddenly Arteta OUT
😂😂😂😂 Troopz should be in a drama
🤣🤣
That's how they'll trust the process and relegated
Troopz needs to go back again, to AFTV he's clowning himself in America 😂
Troopz after the United game: "My MaNaGeR"
My hopes for Arsenal this season are about as high as donny interviewing you 🤦🏻‍♂️
Probably the only guy on the world Troopz seems tough against.  Bit embarrassing the disrespect he gives towards him.
I was dead within the first 15 seconds 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭☠️☠️☠️☠️
Get Henry or Viera as manager
The way the cameraman was shaking, he was scared for his life 🤣🤦‍♂️
Lovin this.wish players had same passion. Got to have some creativity..we havs zero..if we are not playing high intensity pressing game then ozil has to come back in!
Lord Have Mercy... I love Troopz 😭😂😂
It’s called retribution bro. Ozil #humanity.
Arsenal should just sign Pope, Tarkowski, & Mcniel from burnley lol get paid more and still be low table 🤷🏻‍♂️
Ain't blood fam, bro
Bruh arsenal have more crosses than the Vatican😂😂😂
Why did they not do the interview on the stairs? They are right there
Troopz looks like a father shouting at his son 😂😂
5:29 😂😂😂
More like 2 girls arguing over a sugar Daddy.
2:31😂😂😂😂😂
My man was so shook when he had the mic took off him , the disrespect 😂🤣
Really feel sorry for Partey😂😂. He should have just stayed at Atletico Madrid
He’s saying “big man ting” to man standing on a box 😂😂😂
Hahahaha Faxx troopzzzzzz
Tribal chief head of the table  troopz of barstool sports not happpy arteta is a dead man walking
Calm down man
This is funny as fuck 😂😂😂seems like a drunk interview 🙆🏽‍♂️😂🤣
Arteta should just resign, this squad is better than 15th..
Tek time with Zah bro, I know you two are bless but it comes off a lil deep on cam
Troopz abusing this poor child
Y. Chief Keef
Yo this looks fully scripted
No hope man. 15th in the league what a joke 🙄 😑  fuck the guy with the mic.
Likkle man looking like the wheelchair basketball donny off BBC
why is he shouting at the short guy like hes gonna do something 👎🏾troopz is a clown  🙄 he acts up blud 😂
Who the fuck takes this seriously. Wow this is so embarrassing for arsenal
This is fuckin halarious 😂
Troopz badding up a midget, so pathetic
Man should have slapped Troopz up side his head. Disrespectful bludclart.
Arteta: See, I told you lot that Auba can make headers!
Well Big Sam to the rescue once again
In all my years watching AFTV, nobody would ever think about snatching the mic for Don Robbie Capone.
You forgot the passionate
That looks like one of those faked american "behind the scenes interview" in a reality TV-show
Nah why is troopz beefing Robbie 0.5 it’s not fair fam
This guy' almost shit on him self when Troopz grabs the microphone
My man said "big man ting" to likkle man 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Troopz getting interviewed by the Great Gazoo 👽😆😅🤣😄😂
Arsenal have problems within the club and this shows up on the pitch.  The way some players are being treated like Ozil, Saliba, Guendouzi and so on has influenced the teammates.  They think that the way they were treated one day could happen to me.  These situations lead the team to degradation.  It is a total mismanagement by Arteta, an inexperienced coach in a big team.  He has forgotten how Wenger treated the players and will copy Guardiola where he has the luxury of buying 20 players each for 50 million euros and burning anyone.
Ayo troops respect ya self bredda dont snatch things from grown men like dat dawg. Poor form champ
How many managers are you going to sack? Take some responsibility. Bellerin & Xhaka shouldn’t play. Ceballos should play instead of Xhaka.
Troopz gonna get deported carrying on like this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m with Zah these players been dead. #clearthedeadwood
All that's missing is the Zah supplex and throwing him into the cameraman. SUMMERSLAMMMM
toilet TV
This zah guy moves like he’s read a ‘how to speak like a Londoner’ book
😂😂😂😂
This is embarrassing
How long until Zah files a complaint to HR and Troopz is sent back to London 🤔 😂😂😂
Looks like he has stopped saying blud
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
It feels like zah is getting told off for sneaking out at night
Plz artete resigned I dont want to abused fuck of artete my club
Tyrion Ty is politicking well
Troopz ripping the mic was so funny 😂
Stop blaming the manager every year.  It’s the players, they are horrible, no heart.   At least half of the arsenal players should not be playing in the premier league.  Xhaka is the worst captain in arsenal history.
Troops poopz having a breakdown. Leicester city xxxxxxxx
yo ty got smaller
Would rather visit Rwanda than St Marys on Wednesday, for real.
On the bright side guendouzi scored a goal on behalf of arsenal we can use that for a draw
Whata gobshite.  Youz still paying 350 grand to Ozil, you let your best players leave for nothing and its Arteta?  A clear out is needed and give him another couple windows to sort it out.
Don’t ever blame it on auba...
The way troopz grabbed that mic 😂😂
Troopz Lowkey out of the blue arteta out soon as he moved to nyc, you already know he’s gonna rant so he can get his views on his new show🤷🏽‍♂️
Zahs deluded, were arsenal football club being 15th in the league is simply not acceptable the players are too blame but so is the manager. question directly to zah can u see arsenal winning the league with arteta?
you wanted wenger out and now youre whinging about the state of the club. you got what you asked for, you should be happy! i was wenger in because i could see this coming from a mile off. now youre saying fire arteta and then when his replacement get the same out of these players fire him and on and on.
This going viral
feel bad for troopz
The Bushwick Bill of Troopz TV
Zah should stand next TY—> mini me 😂❤️
Will.i.am on a booster stool interviewing angry roadman
Zah looks like a kid being told off by his parents in front of the class.
Nah I'm done troops is sticking it on this guy 🤣🤣
Bellerin is shit so is Cedric ffs your team are all dead simple as that
Wtf is this channel LOL? What's going on?
Nah troopz u need to chill on zah wtf is wrong with u. That’s his opinion! Chill cuz don’t violate him
Me reminding my schoolmate when he drinks alcohol 2:31
Why'd the cameraman pan down to show the box Za was on...... im done lmfaooo
Mesut Ozil has more influence over this team than Mikel Arteta. The players have downed tools in his honour.
omdsssss im dead
I want to see Zah wrestle Ty.
Arteta brought all of Pep's shitehouse tactics, snideness, diving etc,  but none of the skill to Arsenal.  A yard dog team with no skill...Everton.
Troopster youre wromg money is the solver!!! Remember chelski and city!!???
Yo, where the fucking social distancing 🤣🤣😅😂🙂😆😆😃
Troopz might be entertaining but hes a shit bloke. Imagine being in a room with him
Yeah but arteta is the one picking these guys .... arteta was backed more financially as well
Another Ty 😭
Troopz is getting fired before next year
I'm dying inside...lol. On a serious note the whole team need to accept accountability not just Arteta.
Aubamabludclaatyaaang woke up feeling DANGEROUS🥶🥶🥶
Amazing tv tonight 😂😂😂😂
Naaaa the cameraman was mocking it
"Mikel Atekers" Troopz 2020
Bruh i'm done. Arsenal are really out here making fans cut WWE backstage interviews
C'mon troopz don't be disrespectful.
What a wanker, snatches the mic and doesn’t let him speak
i tattooed Arsenal on my heart 10 years ago now im getting a heart transplant
2021/2022 championship fixture  Arsenal v Derby
Hahaha this channels dead! What a melt.hell be back in London by Jan when it flopz
Glory glory Tottenham Hotspur!!
Troopz must be taking the piss when he was shouting “Big Man Ting!”
Imagine zah and ty had a show it will be called the deluded brothers
This brudda is the American Ty 😭😭
I don’t know why but this whole interview is actually so funny lol
Big Sam would definitely have them a lot higher than 15th... the players would work harder, organisation would be better and there would be a tempo and intensity that brings results. If Arsenal are serious they need a 250 mill warchest and a new manager and a full big dick change of direction.
Zah is right, most of the stuff on the field is not football related... its so obvious
Loooooooooool aubaaah who aubaahh wahhhh ... wat u sayin now dnt chat shit about liverpool again
This is Sunday night RAW Troopz vs Arteta for the relegation battle
This dude tys little brother lol.
Wow this guy is angry. Pure entertainment. Unfortunately bad advert for arsenal
It's the American Ty 🤣🤣
Better than AFTV😃👍
Leave Zah alone you prick
Troopz lookin like hes ready to put my man in his blunt...nochill
We're fifteenth 😭😭
He wouldn’t have grabbed that mic like that from Don Robbie..this is abuse 😂
Troopz told Zah.  BIG MAN THING 😂😂😂
@troopztv CALM DOWN ON ZAH. You don’t have to agree with him. He can still have his opinion even thou it’s your channel. 🤯
Arteta has no experience to deal with hard headed players, the way he managed them is by taking away the only thing which will save him his job.
This is like a comedy show with the camera zooming and that 🤣🤣🤣
the best thing about arsenal is there kit
Absolute jokers the pair of you
Troopz wanted Wenger out, we got worse, he then wanted emery out, and we got worse and again, and now wants Arteta out.
Man like DT needs to get these Arteta boys in line
I don't care how mad Troopz is but he can't be grabbing the mic out of the interviewers hand.
4 next league matches: Southampton, Everton, Chelsea and Brighton.   Oh boy...
This is shot like a WWE promo 😂
This is absolute gold! 😂
Aubama-what? Aubama-who? Aubama-own-goal-yang!!
Maan do this, maan do that maan not hot! Get Pochetino before Man u get him
At least the Blunts are still bottom of league & long may it continue!
Cameraman on a madness showing the stool 😭
Is this some kind of weird niche on the Internet? A man bullying someone who's stood on a box?
"BiG man ting" - that was a little harsh, no?! 👀😬🤷🏾‍♂️
Why does it feel Troopz is gonna hit the dwarf with a steel chair
Give Arteta time - No manager can make these players work
Troopz would never snatch the mic like that from Robbie
Get yours Zah! Buzzing for you my guy
Why did they zoom in on the box 😂😂😂😂💀💀
"Be Excisted" 2 Josh Kroenke
Hornswoggle vs Vince McMahon
Said it to my mates, should have got Mourinho (If we could) and looked how arteta developed at another club first, at this point I would have got us higher than 15th, "money fixes everything" never seen that guy zah but I like him
0:49 the camera man🤣
Why does this feel practiced
Troopz NEEDS to relax and bun a spliff
Only man I know that’s illiterate on two continents 😂😂😂
Don robbie would slap him up if he grabbed his mic - poor zah looks shooked
Troopz, stop bullying Zah!
Troops come back to uk aftv need u back
I like Zah, but dude getting on my nerves right now!
Christ, Lockdown has been hard on Robbie
I don’t think they was ready for the real troopz with his heart for arsenal fc
This isn’t troopz man??? He’d never take the mic of Robbie
I am commenting on all Arsenal fan channels. Are we the only club that talks this "Trust the Process", "Back the Manager" bullshit? These buzz words n catchphrases have to be the biggest pile shit in sports. You now know when a sports team is about winning or branding. Yet fans keep saying "back the manager". Are they not getting paid millions to perform. Stop being a bunch of cowards and accepting failure. Scandalous.
Troopz is so right arteta out
😂😂😂😂lol y’all should have never brought Troopz to America he gone tell it like he see it no filter
Cédric is better then Bellerín. This should be your team against Southampton.  Leno  Cédric Pablo Marí Gabriel Maghãlhaes Tierney  Willock  Ceballos  Nelson  Smith-Rowe  Saka   Nketiah   With a 9-1-0 formation
I feel like im watching Jackass
proper WWE Backstage Interview
its arteta putting them there
Man, I bet troopz finna kick this likkle don out the window sooner or later lmfaoo
0:50 you did a great job camera guy
Arsenal In the mud, your manager looks like a supervisor in Zara
The feels like a bad into to a WWE match!
There are drunk 80 year olds in a bar right now who know more about football than troopz. He is so fake.
Ok Troopz man, I will say this. I'm a Liverpool fan. When Brendan came into the club, we had a team of Andy Carrol, Downing, Joe Cole, Koncesky, Charlie Adam etc etc. He signs Sturridge and Coutinhio and the team and quality of football approved considerably. But, even in Brendans first 6 months, at least the football he was trying to play was good. I don't know if you need to get better players, but the style of play under Arteta is bad. So give Arteta till January, get his players, and if they don't work, get rid of him.
Allan joined us from napoli whos in the europa
ZAH is the adult in the room. TROOPZ is too emotional and irrational . Arteta is not the problem,it’s the worthless underperforming below average so-called players.They need to go.
when he put his hand up to talk, omg im dying!!!
All Jokes asides now *Ozil in!!* Because if them whole team stop this behaviour Arsenal will be relegated!!! #Facts
ARTETA OUT! #FREEOZIL!!
Troopz moving like he’s bout to have a wwe entrance after his rant 😂
Them attitude era vibes r back lol 😂 & I was just waiting for someone to say “My name is Kane & I’m a ruddypoo candy ass “
U didn't have to take it out on zah
Troopz saying big man thing to Zah.....shit go haha
YOU FACKIN WALLAD
Arsenal will be relegated this season! Why you ask? Arsenal has chosen money over morality! When your player speaks out against concentration camps in China, your club silences him! I hope Arsenal Football Club ends.
impact wrestling looks weird these days... great promo tho...
Fam the quality in the video
😂 When an interviewer became interviewed 😂😂
Troopz needs to chill man , Willie wonker will bang that door down and take him home
this is more entertaining than AFTV
No way artea has no experience  Emery is 100 times better atleast we would get draws with these clowns now look at artea were a damn championship side nowwwww
MAN LIKE CHIEF KEEF 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Lil yatchy voice: “Bro Chill”
Arsenal fans after a loss are entertainment gold lol
This is the same guy that called him artekkers 😂
Staged!!!!
i ain’t know kofi kingston was an arsenal fan
Is he standing on a box 🤣😂🤣😊😀
Half an hour later im still waiting for him to get his mic back
Take your time with it?

If aftv are looking to bring troopz back the studio will be gone
ARTETA IN
Oh I love it
When he said "with your chest" i felt that
Zah became silent after troopz grabbed the mic🤣🤣
Arteta out
Another TY
Troops talking straight facts man #artetaout #COYG
Fucking hell, Troopz with a look of murder when zah said Arteta in!!
Troopz yelling BMT is just funny in this context
If your not attractive then what manager is gonna come in... no one any manager can come in and won’t succeed at arsenal get that into your head troopz man
Xhaka had 39 cards before this game... 37 yellows and 2 reds. He would've had his 38th yellow cards, but he's an idiot for grabbing that dude's neck. The yellow was because of him being slow to turn. Arteta has had 2 transfer windows.  In the first, he begged Xhaka to stay, he signed Cedric & Mari. (3 players he wanted in the team). The second transfer window, he renewed Auba, Saka and Martinelli's contracts. (Another 3 players). He brought Ceballos back from Madrid, begged Ainsley and Bellerin to stay when we had offers. (2 more players) Signed Willian, Partey and Gabriel. (3 more players) That is 11 players he kept. He even sold Emi Martinez, loaned out Guendouzi and Torreira. I ain't having that "He doesn't have his own team".
He’s got a point it’s not peps bitch fault the players are shit
2:26
The camera guy violated him😂😂
Arsenal fans are the must deluded fans in the world. FACT
Take your time wid it😂😂😂😂
We love troopz
NORTH LONDON IS 🔵 🔵 COYS COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵 COYS 🔵
How long has this fool been a Gooner? He thinks Gazidis is gonna whip out his chequebook and solve the situation? He could have done it years ago. Done NOTHING.
Zah tryna create hostility 🤣 Luv it. Arsenal need to keep Arteta till end of the season..they need to have a Renaissance.
Where's Josh "be excited we're 15th in the Premier League" Kronke ? I feel sorry for Arteta and the players - it is not their problem. Who appointed Arteta - Who is managing this shitshow - it's the Kronkes - it is their management decisions that have caused this problem from Day 1 - so real Arsenal fans don't blame Arteta or the players - it's these septic c unts that are running this shit show on the cheap ! They do not understand the club - our club's values or ethos ! Get these septic unts out of our club !
Troopz bring the rant to New York 🤣🤣
I thought I’d never find someone more stupid than TY. Zah proved me wrong.
A new double act to rival Claude and Ty !!!!!
Blatantly scripted, troops sold his soul!!!
feel bad for zah😭
CLIPPED VID UPLOADED ON MY CHANNEL 😂
Arsenal and arteta are dudssss, lets go Chelsea!!!!
Pure gold 🏅
Can we sack half the Squad? Mikel has been completely let down I agree he’s made mistakes but come on this squad 😡😡😡😡
Looool it really is Barstool @0:48
This is how passionate us English men get over football, our first love is are football team lol
Maybe in a few years time Arteta will be a great manager. But to come into this Arsenal team and turn things around it takes more than desire. A lot of experience and resilience is needed and as a young manager he does not have that.
Troopz would never do that to Robbie
Alladyce has been known for preventing team from relegation!
If zaar was bigger he would slap troopz for that mic violation😂
Mc Troopz...... Snatch 🎤 assassin. 😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😆
Bro, since you left the UK with our last win against Utd, we lost so many games since then. Maybe it's time for you to come back to the UK in order for us to win again.
can see troopz binning this off soon haha. This guy has no clue
Troopz mum was Wenger in...  She wasn’t mad
This is trash
Good ebening When you thought Arsenal couldn’t get any lower this guy appears!
Should’ve kept Emery 🤷🏽‍♂️
Fuck the process Arteta out
lol When Troopz grabbed the mic
Troopz gave Zah the "Are you mad" look?😂😂😂
troopz call DT he said Arteta is the future.  my man troopz speaking from the heart
Why’s this like wwe backstage interview 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The cameraman occasionally appreciating Troopz's fit😂
Felt like Michael Cole was interviewing The Peoples Champ THE ROCK... old school WWF vibes
Arteta out
Yo, when the cameraman moved the camera down to Zah legs. That had me bussin up. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal has had financial loses during the pandemic and folks think owners are going to fire a manager and have to spend millions paying off the manager and then hire another one and pay him millions?  That's not happening.
Yo the Mike switch was mad , got scared he was going to bang him
Give Zars microphone back man. You would never do that to Robbie.
dont disrespect Zah and take the mic like that. I know we're angry and upset, but come on, that's your guy/colleague
So they put a midget in to wind troopz up . Don't take his midget shit.  Smack him up if the little fuker is trying it
Man jus took the microphone lmaooo
Who’s he think he’s talking to like that 😂😂shouting and poking man 🤣
"We're 15th you fucking wallad" 😭😭😭😭😭
I can’t take Zah serious when he’s calling Özil “Orzil”
Omg why you grab the mic like that 😂
WWE backstage lol
Been depressed all night but this makes me laugh I love troopZ mannnn
Sam allerdyce dho 😂😂😂
What happened to Mikel Artekers?
This doesn't seem real no more, it's like a circus..
Big up Troopz,  Arsenal 0:1 Burnley  Terrible performance at HOME from a lot of the players…notably the “experienced & trusted” bunch!!! I am gutted!!! We CAN’T get a win from a team that sat below us in the league at our own HOME!!! There is something wrong with this team and I will blame Arteta sparely today for it.  We have played 12 matches so far in the EPL;  - Fulham 0:3 Arsenal  - Arsenal 2:1 West Ham  - Liverpool 3:1 Arsenal  - Arsenal 2:1 Sheffield Utd  - Man City 1:0 Arsenal  - Arsenal 0:1 Leicester city  - Man Utd 0:1 Arsenal  - Arsenal 0:3 Aston Villa  - Leeds Utd 0:0 Arsenal  - Arsenal 1:2 Wolves  - Tottenham 2:0 Arsenal - Arsenal 0:1 Burnley  6 red cards Last 5 league matches - LOST 4 Consecutive HOME matches - LOST 13 points from 12 matches and 15th in the table, 5 points away from RELEGATION Waters.  How can one explain a team play where youngsters (Saka, Tierney, Magalhães) performs way better and take responsibilities over the likes of Xhaka, Bellerín, Lacazette, Aubameyang.  How can a team with players such as Leno, Aubameyang, Lacazette, Ozil, Luiz, Willian, Partey be this “average”?  I will lay blames on a chunk of the senior players for these disastrous and unacceptable results.  I blame Arteta the more because he chose these players and they will send him to an early sacking.  Why can’t Arteta see what everyother fans see and understand that the so-called “senior and experienced” players are not willing to strive for the desired results.  Arteta keeps playing the wrong players every time and expecting a positive result.  That’s not possible.  Arteta needs to make a bold decision and drop players that are not performing!!! He should work his talk!!!  Arteta MUST change the team.  Start players that will be bold and direct to bring him results!!!  Leno  Soares , Magalhães , Mari, Tierney  Partey (fit), Elneny  Smith Rowe, Ceballos, Saka  Aubameyang   Maitland-Niles for Partey  Luiz for Mari Pepe for Saka or Smith Rowe  Give Auba one last chance against Southampton and if he plays poorly, give him a rest and replace him with Balogun or a fit-again Martinelli.  The team lacks a CAM; The Owner and the Board MUST assist Arteta in this January transfer with at least 3 quality players (2 ball-carrying attacking midfielders to Partner, Partey in the midfield) and another winger to compete with Pepe and willian.  1. Houssem Aouar  2. Jack Grealish or Dominik Szoboszlai  3. Wilfred Zaha  However, till that time, Arteta MUST start winning matches or he will face the EXIT door!!!
Troopz is hurting bruh
Fully feels like a wwe backstage interview 😂😂😂😂😂
Need to get Sam Allardyce in quick to avoid relegation
Troopz saying what players are gonna come into the club and saying what teams are gonna buy these players well there we go the players and the board at the problem because any manager I’ll fail with no backing hardly and managing a bunch of bottle jobs

From Champions League to Champions Hip. Arteta IN!
Damn Troopz got my guy Zah shook after he grab the mic 😂
Troopz Zah is an American business man... he owns you
Arteta is scared weak manager. He fucked off Saliba, Guendouzi, Laca, AMN, Martinelli, Ozil.  Arteta is totally out of his depth at every level
Zah, im sorry but Arteta has lost the dressing room open your eyes please hes finished  our football club
Silliest fan group, circus entertainers.
Fam get this clown zah or whatever he’s name is ,off this show !!!..:.....joker
THE WAY TROOPZ GRABBED THE MIC IM CRYING OH MY DAYS 🤣🤣🤣
Arteta thought he was Pep freezing out man like guendozi,ozil,saliba & etc now look lmfao Zah sounding like a true american casual
Zah sees sense...these dogshit players need to step up and take some responsibility! Troopz is right tho about questioning why arteta continues to pick them....
Zah is ty in disguise.
when mans snatched za’s mic minute 2:30 😭🤣😂
when the camera panned down to the... box.....? Why man? 🤣
Wow Robbie lost a lot of weight!
Who is interviewing who ?
3:40 with ur chest😂
Troopz TV>AFTV

Camera man louding up Zah
Zah is totally deluded he has no fucking idea what.he is talking about. Typical US guts talking BS
What's ZAH standing on
how many times is xhaka going to cost us ? lets be real though arteta isnt going anywhere
Don't get why Troopz even needs Barstool he carries the whole show himself
"money fixes everything" jesus-how stupid can u get?
Omg 😳
Elneny did an Eddie Guerrero feint after that dirty elbow. Viva la raza!!
Were 15th
Both of them have points but troopz’s argument is stronger
Zah is delusional how my man saying were gonna get better with this manager
Man like Chief Keef is still Arteta in wow
When Troopz grabbed the mic Zah probably feared for his life
Wait Artheta wins 4 in a raw EVERYONE WILL BE LIVKING HIS SHIT HOLE
Zah you need to be impartial when interviewing, u can have ur opinion after
We have double the amount of sending offs since Arteta has been in the job than the second team. YOU CAN BLAME THE MANAGER!!!
It's Karma because Arsenal treated Ozil unfairly, Now Ozil is laughing at Arteta and the board #Arteta_Out
0.50 reminding us hes standing on something

Thnk u troopz i agreee with u 1000%
😂😂😂the way he grabbed the mic
Not gonna lie a lot of the players have let the manager down today, even while Arteta has fucked up today
Making Auba captain was the worst decision of the season
"Gimme the mic"  easssyyy naaaaaawwww
Troopz was hyping up arteta saying he’s better than lampard and ole and that just makes this more funny 😂😅
Troopz grabbing the mic is so disrespectful to me
The thing about the Arteta out people is that no matter who we bring in if Arteta gets sacked. The manager won’t be elite, the players will let him down, and within a year the fans will be calling for him to be sacked.
AUBAMEY WHO? AUBAMEY WHAT? AUBAMEY BLOOD CLAAT YANG
Feels like Wwe attitude era times
Bellerin isn't the scapegoat today

Wenger beat Burnley 5-0 last time and he beat them every game. We've been breaking negative records since he left. Stop trying to replace him, he was never the problem. Just bring him back and support him financially this time! #OneArseneWenger #WeWereTheArsenal #BringWengerBack 🔴⚪ 🏆🐐
I've missed these troopz rants 🤣🤣
Funniest thing about the arsenal game was their fans false sense of hope when Elneny didn’t get a red or give away a pen only to concede from the corner 5 seconds later.
Troopz my man just get out of that contract and come back home bro your blood pressure is on a 10000
0:48 Why the camera pan to the box? Did man dirty lmaoo
Barstool violated g when it comes to production value so i hope that checks nice

Troops come back to AFTV
We need to realise there’s not much a manager can do with these players
Hello Darkness My Old Friend
