From yellow away kit
Lukaku was slowly starting to take off again, but that interview let him down 😔 let us all down.
1:54, Love how Lukaku and Hudson Odoi were angry about not receiving the pass, even though the shot was clearly the better option.
Omd u don’t know how happy i am to see kovacic and kante
I’m convinced that Penghino only scores pens
Jorginho scores a penalty  Chelsea fans: give him the ballon d'or
jorginho is such a pen merchant
No way is that a pen. He fell into konsa. Practically pushed him
Lukaku is going to be decisive in the next couple weeks for Chelsea’s title charge
1:57 there in sync
2:20 that LB got BLACKEDRAW 😂😂😂
Bolingoli 45
Villa beginning to look a lot like Rangers under Gerrard Get the wing backs forward and get cross after cross after cross into the box Predictable
All I got from this game is that.  We were better in the first half easily.  But without Mcginn and when they subbed on lukaku in the second half everything went wrong.  We should have had a pen. Chelsea fans said that when James took out konsa but the whistle was blown for offside which was later proved to be onside. But despite all of that lukaku completely changed the game and what a player he is.  But at least I know that we have an absolutely spectacular goalkeeper.   We move in to Brentford  UTV
This commentary, one of the best I've ever heard.
Good game
I like how hudson and lukaku did the sign of "i was here" at the same time😂😂 in 1:54
Kante, Lukaku and Kova all back 😍
2:20 "you can't stop the shine"
Can not stop the shine absolute animal
Jorginho goals this season: 9 Jorginho penalties scored this season: 9
3 players very well done. Mateo Kovacic. Rom Lukaku. CHO.
Chelsea winning wasnt because of lukaku you idiots it was switching to a back 4
Martin Atkinson shouldn't have a job
Lukaku. The best striker in the PL is back in business!
What a header from Reece James tho
Gerrards doing well since leaving rangers…
On talkSPORT the commentators were so harsh to Hudson Odoi
Martinez thinks he's so good, couldn't even stop Jorginho penalties in two tries. He hasn't learned what that other keeper learned and that's to not move until the ball is hit or fake a move to one side so that he shoots in the other and you dive the other way to save it. He has a better chance to save Ronaldo penalty than Jorginho
Jorginho deserves goal of the month
1:56 cho & r9 doing copy & paste looool
I don't understand how Villa's Konta was not sent off for denial of goal scoring opportunity. Lukaku was through on goal with only goalkeeper to beat.
Jorginho 1st penalty was really rather poor; the 2nd one is not any better either.. but as the Commentator said, he won the battle of the nerves
How was that not a red, last man back
people call ronaldo = penaldo  why not also call jorginho = penginho
Aston Villa keeper no dancing ? 😂
penginho
he went trippin
imagine if jorghinho ever scored a goal that was not a penalty
Lukaku is just the perfect striker he literally has every attribute possible.
Pen merchants
That run by lukaku where the defender gave away the pen is a Drogba re-enactment. Some player
Who’s this ref…. How’s not a red… bollokcks
Chelsea a 1 man team.
Mings really is a poor defender, Championship at best. God knows how he gets into the England team. The Lukaku goal highlights how poor a defender he is. Still trying to figure out what he was doing for the 2nd goal.
Lukaku is the missing piece of the jigsaw that man is the reason why Chelsea will win the Premier league 💯
Lukaku is good Playing False no9 but Tuchel likes wasting him, i hope he learns something about how to use LKK
Mount is so overrated
1:56 good to see synchronised poses to berate a fellow teammate for not going for the easy assist
Another spectacular penalty performance from Jorginho. He got robbed of that Ballon d' or
How was konsa not sent off
Def not a penalty that second one. Lukaku puts his leg across Konsa and even then there’s minimal contact
Love how this doesn’t show our own decision. Nor does it show any of how villa played in the first half usual trash from sky
Let's be honest Hudson odoi played brilliant 👏
Chelsea only win on pens
chelsea are nothing without set pieces most overrated team in the prem
Get Cho to do some more shooting practice and he’ll become a scary winger!
You got to feel sorry for Matt Targett, he got outpaced by Lukaku not once but twice...
Jorginho penalty merchant
Mings the England centre half
Penchelsea
Just me or do chelsea only win games through penalties?
Lukaku the battering ram
Jorginho is the biggest pen merchant ever
one of Alonsos best games. Still cannot wait for the return of Chilwell.
Lukaku came off the bench and immediately made an impact. A well deserved man of the match
What o what was Mings doing  for Chelsea's second. He tried to hold Lukaku off with body strength instead of attacking the ball.. awful defending
Does anyone consider Lukaku world class? I think he’s a top striker not world class, but I can only think few strikers that’s better than him, so surely that makes him world class, right?
PENmerchant 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mr Perfection Is  Riyad Mahrez 🇩🇿❤
jorginho only scores pens
Konsa shoulda been sent off
Jorgie is so underated he is the glue that Links Chelsea together,I hope he gets the props he deserves (I'm an Arsenal supporter)
Penginho
Chelsea are so poor to watch, after buying the champions league you think they would of built a entertaining style by now
SOTV
Mings watching the game instead of playing in it, all mouth and no substance...
Shut up ur not coming back just watch ur getting battered by liverpool
the amount of jorghino pens are insane this season
And people call bruno a pen merchant
All Jorginho is, is a penalty taker 😂 he’s nothing special
Penginho
2:37
Chelsea getting penalties what a surprise
Lukaku: has 1 good game  The entire comment section: cHeLsEa ArE sO mUcH bEtTeR wItH lUkAkU   We've been far better this season without an out an out striker with a fluid front 3. Don't get me wrong if lukaku can keep bagging goals then sure he should start but he has to press more.
Chelsea out of the title race already
Why did Konsa not get a red for the second penalty?   He’s last man with Lukaku in a goal scoring opportunity, then comes in from behind and doesn’t get the ball? What am I missing?
Classic sky, not showing the fact that Villa dominated Chelsea
You can't stop the shine
Someone please take Mings on a free transfer
I would not trust jorginho to take penalties. Don't like his technique. Always think it's a 50/50.
Lukaku is a problem, be ready to tussle and outwit him. He's just a bulldozer. Good game. Chelsea have a lot of ballers. CHO, Jorginho, RJ, Mount, etc.
Kovacic back tho🙌🏽
These VAR assistant refs are a joke can anybody tell me why the Villa defender wasn't sent off for the penalty on LUKAKU
About time Lukaku actually scores
Mr perfection missed a big penalty for Italy wich most likely no world cup for Italy 😡🤬
Jorginho’s first penalty went exactly where it went in the euro final VSA Pickford and I’m just laughing because Martinez is a brilliant keep and he fails to save that
Kovacic does not get the credit he deserves guy is an animal in that midfield
How can you call Jorginho mr perfection from 12 yards when he has missed more than a few including one in a major international final 😂
Does Jorginho ever miss a penalty? Fair play to him
Pace, power, precision, Lukaku is an absolute beast!
0:24 wrong end or not that’s a good header
Penalty merchants thinking they have a shot at the title 🤡
Poor old Stevie G is now finding out management in the big boys league
hahaha Chelsea fans defended the shoe box that is Lukaku... us United fans said he would get the odd goal but wait... use will replace him.
What's with all the penalties lately
Target 🎯 Rom
Carney Chukwuemeka lost the ball and didn't even drop back to chase down the player who robbed him, poor attitude from the youngster. Should have been subbed off for that
That's one of the headers of the season from Reece James...oh wait!
This is the major difference between Dean Smith and Gerrard. It was a mistake to discard Smith. We used to give these teams a fright and even beat them by competing with an attacking threat. Now we pack everyone behind the ball and look for a breakaway goal and no surprises we get beaten. You cannot play like this against quality teams they will win easily. Ings and Watkins doesn’t work and we need more attacking threat. Used to have Trezequet, El Ghazi or Traore roaming wide upfront and doing their defensive duties helping the 2 wing backs. This game, both backs were faced with 2 on 1 several times. We need to stop worrying about them and let them start worrying about us.
Lukaku is not getting enough service yet,  our wingers and midfielders are not reading his movements enough plus our midfielders are good enough on short balls only.
Pure idiocy from Villa tbh don't go deep if you can't defend the other end then to bring players down in that lazy fashion ..... back to the drawing board lads
Chelsea are so reliant on penalties now a days its worrying
nice to see all the sides getting penaltys after Liverpool got clearly robbed against spurs by corrupt VAR decisions.
Chelsea are the most boring team going
Lukaku's pace and strength is insane.
Lukaku went from Akinfenwa outside the box to a calcium deficiency patient inside it 😂
The comments section: LUKAKU…..
Lukaku absolutely turned the game on it’s head. Call me deluded if you wish, I think our title push is still very much on.
I’m not arguing against the decisions but I thought if you stopped a goal scoring opportunity it was a red card? The fist pen I understand isn’t a yellow but the second one Lukaku is the last man, clearly going for goal and he’s brought down 🤔 I’m not a Chelsea fan arguing for the dismissal, I’m just trying to get a better understanding of the rules
1:55 Lukaku and Hudson odoi clones
Literally Jorginho can only take pens
2:27 shouldnt this be a red? last defender taking him out from a clear goal scoring opportunity
Lukaku is so underated also I won a 33/1 bet a penalty to be scored in both halves never doubted you jorginho!!! Merry Christmas to me!
“Did you ever doubt him” Me: yes
suddenly over the last few weeks the defence for chelsea seem to be making some silly defence errors
How was konsa not sent off 😂😂
Villa should have sent Mings for a PCR test!!  He is garbage.
Penginho
How does konsa not get sent off
The last time lukaku scored in the Orem was against villa earlier on. Chelsea fans are deluded in saying ‘he’s back’
Mings england International 🤦🤦🤦🤦
Lukaku was clearly brilliant and changed the game but kovacic also had a massive impact, he's just brilliant, runs with the ball and drives at players, keeps the ball well and creates chances, absolute baller, criminally underrated.
Actually thought mings was ready for a step up but he needs to wake up and take a game he’s been rotten for villa this season there desperate for a decent centre half for last two years
Nice
Funny how Jorginho is never called a pen merchant but when Bruno gets one penalty he is swarmed with the phrase. All cause he plays for man United. Jorginho offers nothing major except penalties
Why is it everytime jorginho scores a penalty he gets praised like he just scored an absolute banger
Although he got himself two goals Jorginho has to be one of the most over rated Chelsea players ever to wear the shirt
Lukaku is worth 2.5 times Villa's most expensive player (Buendia) so it doesn't really surprise me.
Hudson odoi is doing so well
letss goo romelu
How is Konsa complaining about that😂 it’s an awful challenge lucky it wasn’t a red
Hudson Odoi terrible in front of goal
Chelsea fans are so delusional they think one game makes him the best in the world lukaku so far has been a flop
So many soft doctored penalties especially the first where lukaku shoves the defender onto his path across him 😂 all to keep the league close 💰
Ofc thee Italian scores 2 penalties😂
Chelsea way too reliant on penalties
Tyrone mings couldnt handle lukaku all half
Is it just me who is annoyed thats there is no clock or scoreboard
Enjoy losing stevie
Great to see Lukaku back to his absolute best!  Hope we see this form continue throughout the season!  What a presence he had today!
Anyone else think that last challenge by wasnt a penalty? Lukaku stepped on Konsa's foot causing him to fall into him?
The new penalty kings, its every game.. Man U's record is in danger
lukaku impact
I was fearful of more dropped points but we came good in the end.
Keep thinking I'm watching Dortmund
“did you ever doubt him” tbf both penalties he wasn’t far away
Can’t stand Jorginho
bruh this guy is a pen merchant
Lukaku is world class I love him
Just can't stop the shine
Lukaku is powered by love. You love him he delivers and you don’t love him he doesn’t which is why he wasn’t good but was still good at man United. Lukaku really cares about his teammates and if they don’t show him love or hug him when he scores he is empty and thus cannot perform. Just my theory 😂 love you big rom 💙
Chelsea will finish 3rd cause Liverpool and city are a level above them you can see that when Chelsea are missing players they don’t have the quality or depth also city are like a machine and have so much strength in depth and Liverpool can rely on the likes of jota origi and minamino
the fact that jorginho comes away from games like this with a brace or even 1 goal is embarassing lukaku deserved his brace they need to start putting whoever wins the pen on it if it’s someone like lukaku
Gerrard really struggling against top 4 sides.
Tyrone Mings is one of the most overrated defenders I’ve ever seen.
Jorghininho=pen merchant
Why is no one talking about the second pen and that lukaku elbowed him and that’s why he went down
i was there today i was on villas side
The shine never stops
2nd penalty should have been a straight up red card!
How many penalties is that for Chelsea npw?
Anyone else see lukaku and Hudson-odoi in perfect sync with each other after mounts miss
Lukaku is good at the football
Everyone talking about Lukaku but Kovacic was superb and he has been unreal for Chelsea this season, before his injury.
Foden clear of mount 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Penalsea
A FIT Lukaku has to play every time
mendy really living up to cech boots even conceding similar goals as he did
Pengihno out in full force again lol
What this game tells us- Jorginho is good at Penalties 🤣 And Lukaku can make the difference .
Mason Mount is washed
Lukaku when he runs that right channel is a problem
Jorginho is a pen merchant that's all he is
Is it just me or was the second pen not even a foul? Konsa falls over (Lukaku possibly stands on his toe?) and Lukaku just falls over next to him because he knows he can get a pen if he does; I don't see any contact initiated by Konsa on Lukaku, let alone enough to bring him down. Poor refereeing as per usual in the Prem (not that I think it altered the match outcome at all in this case)
Villa cancelled the game against Burnley on the 18th December 2 hours before kickoff because of covid.  8 days later they put a full team out apart from Mcginn??  Strange.
By no means a Chelsea fan but nice to see Matrinez beaten from the spot twice
Chelsea were dead first half
No pen by me
Lukaku is a pure embodiment of a striker
Chelsea must be mentally disturbed you are not starting your best player time & time again what is wrong with you this is why you draw/lose matches
If mount scored that chance 🥵
So embarrassing that Man Utd sold this guy at a loss
First half villa put some work in fair play lads on to the next one utv
The tough times are almost over all of our players are back just in time for Liverpool and City
I think without mings lukaku is just another striker 🤣
Even I got out of breath watching lukaku’s run
What a goal from reece james, some header, own goal of the season 😂
Lakaka
Jorginho hasn’t scored any goals this year that haven’t been outside 12 yards. THE WHOLE YEAR. WTF
Konsa only getting a yellow card even though he was last man back 🤦🏻‍♂️
Where are the Jorginho penalty merchant comments?? Oh wait he doesn’t play for United 🤣
Chelsea looked there strongest when they were playing without lukaku and werner but apparently lukaku is the glue that the team needed all along….
Is that 6 penalties in 3 games for Jorgi?
Second penalty should have been a free kick to Villa. Lukaku played the man with his elbow.
Martinez 👏👏.what a save..
I don’t know how that wasn’t a red for Konsa..
Jorginho is an absolute monster from 12 yards. Martinez giving it wiggly wiggly but old jorgy like not today mate, boom.
Easy win. Cheers villa 🤙🏼
1:56 😂 Romelu Lukaku and Callum Hudson-Odoi
Doesnt mendy know he doesnt need to jump to grab the ball
what a pen merchant jorginho is
Lukaku dived and even pushed Konsa. Today should have only been 2-1
Kovacic should really be starting over jorginho🤦🏽‍♂️😪I feel so comfortable with him playing
Second penalty wasn’t a penalty and likely should have got a red card for pushing Konsa over and clearly diving
And people call Bruno a pen merchant
2 penalties seriously? This is how the top 4 always win, by getting cheap penalties
Decent header from Reece tbf
Own goal of the month
he's not mr perfection from 12 yards though is he. misses plenty
Call me crazy but for me Benteke is a better player. Needs a bit of confidence back but think he’s still got it. Certainly at their best I’d have Benteke
Jorginho 3rd best player in the world doing what he does 😀
Kovacic and kante is deadly
Everyone talking about lukaku but kovakic brought calmness to the midfield
*IDC WHAT ANYBODY SAYS* *JORGINHO IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THIS CURRENT CHELSEA TEAM* *DEBATE YOUR NAN*
Respect to lukaku but villa had some great control and counters in the first half, how is it sky sports don't show any of it at all, ever...
That right back called cash from aston villla is terrible. Always does something stupid.
That was Scudetto Big Rome. He's Back!
Lukaku is a beast, so powerful. Wish we had him at arsenal
pen merchant
Lukaku deserved to take the penalty
All the boys did really well today up the blues💙💙💙
Has reece james been chilling with drake again 😩😩💙
Chelsea play decent football, but they can't finish their chances
shouldve been red, lukaku was the last man. what is ith this refereeing these days
“Mr perfection” who missed 3 of his last 6
Rash from cash
Lukaku just looks like a beast,  as a defender you'd be scared watching him pacing into the box. Jorgino cool as ice as usual!
How was that not a red card for the last penalty? Last man preventing a goalscoring opportunity with a deliberate foul
mrs who? perfection? get outta here
Kovacic’s influence on this game was so underrated
AGAIN "super League" team star hits a defender, falls over himself and gets a penalty. First pen was a joke too. Refs are fully corrupt. Clear as day.   Dirty cheating Premier League nonsense.
Everybody taking about Lukaku but nobody mentioning the guy Chelsea really missed for the last few weeks, my man Mateo Kovacic. He always goes under the radar, totally changed the rhythm in the midfield. Praise to Lukaku as well, Chelsea is coming back after few rough games!
imagine how many chelsea players will be at the top of the top scorers list if they took all the penalties Jorginho takes
Penslea
Lakaka
Who would win a fight between Lukaku and Konate
Jorginho is such a pen merchant 🤣🤣
I thought Villa where good today ever since steven
Penghino is the most overrated player right now. How did he get 3rd in ballondor when he hasn’t scored a goal from open play for Chelsea in 2 years.
Tyrone mings defending Lukaku like that 🤔
Kante MOTM, that guy can do whatever he wants on the field
More like… Aston V 1 - 3 BLM Football Club.
Ming's 'challenge' for the ball with Lukaku, laughable.
you can do many things in life but you can’t stop the shine ✨
Never a penalty, Lukaku puts his left leg out and fouls Konsa
Villas tackling is shocking and has been all season 😬
Peniniho
Big ROM to the rescue & Jorginho one the best pen takers I’ve ever seen
Big Rom is back 😍
Stevie g pumped again love it villa going down
Look at Callum and Lukaku at 1:56😂  Mason should have squared it or smashed it. Unlucky Lukaku changing the game 💙💙
Some goal by reece James
Man Alonso is bad, surely there has to be a u23,21,18s they could use instead
How is that only s yellow for konsa?
Penelsea
Well done to lukaku getting another goal after being injured for a while but now jorginhos gonna get hyped up even more when all he is, is a penalty merchant
Lakakaa
How is that second penalty given? Lukaku pushes him off his feet lmfao.
Amount penaltythey get. This was united last season and people couldnt stop on about it
Lakaka
Russian club Penski
Chelsea should change there name to pen fc
The aim is to win the tittle. Chelsea need to win against Brighton and win against Liverpool. That will put them firmly back into the the titte race.
2:38 Lukaku was on his way to ground before the player touched him, crumbles for a big lad huh
I love how the commentator on 2:57 basically called him a pen merchant
Konsa got away with one there. Never looked like even trying to win the ball. I know they have the double jeopardy rule for keepers but surely when a defender jumps in like that it's a red and a pen?
where's McGinn?
Penalties make a difference to this team, not Lukaku
Amazing what a difference having your key players back makes. Seems like people forgot CHO, kante, kovacic, lukaku, Werner, havertz and chillwell were all out when they were making their comments over the last few weeks. Would have had more points if chelsea got the same treatment as other teams last week when they tried to have the game called off.
What one sided highlights
All of the goals we conceded today were avoidable. Cash tackle was stupid completely unnecessary. Mings defending on lukaku was useless just let him get in front. Mings is awful that’s why. And another penalty
2 pens each for the 2 oil baron teams.
jorginho got robbed of man of the match
We played well first half I’d say we were the better team. But at half time tuchel made his changes and lukaku completely changed the game. Hudson odoi and jorghino played well tbf. Jacob Ramsey was our stand out player once again he’s some talent
You cannot stop the shine
Man city win title no chance Chelsea
Villa is a baby Lfc now cant wait for another Derby 🙃😆
If Mings can play for England so can my wife.
How was that only a yellow card For Konsa? It should have been a straight red and a 3 match ban.
What a header from James to be fair
Jorginho Is a pen merchant
Pen merchant
God I hate Jorginho
LUKAKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
What a own goal though 😂
Cho Is class
How was that not a red? That's the bigger question.
Pulisic was underrated today Wish Tuchel could stop changing his position
chelsea diving for yet another penalty. only way they can win
How on Earth is that last foul not a red card?
All attention turns to Liverpool now...
Surely chelsea cheated the last goal through am a chelsea fan 💙 great performance
Jorginho can only score pens most overrated player
SOTV 🤣
Here we go again fraud premier league
Jorgie looks set to be our top scorer again this season 😂
I'm looking forward to getting Gilmour,  Gallagher and Broja back,  all in the mix fighting for places, what a squad and Cobham schooled players...Chelsea are a Conveyor-belt of World Class Talent
LAKAKA
how on earth is that not a red?
villa fans getting put in their place. the most overhyped team
Fightback in the title race? Nice joke mate
1:53 I just mean, really, mount?!
Lakaka
JORGINHO THE PENALTY ROBOT
How on earth wasn’t that a red card 😆 😂???????
how that isnt a red card for konsa baffles me
Chelsea stop the rot.
Matt target just got embarresed😂😂
Jorginho 🔥🔥🔥 my pen merchant
1:54 is it me or Lukaku does this sometimes he points at the space Infront of him whenever someone shoots instead of pass to him
2:23 is the reason why chelsea signed lukaku! We’ve been missing that since Diego Costa left
LAKAKA
All this talk about Lukaku hell soon find his foot he was injured and struggling to fit in tuchel system but when tuchel can fit him in it  he'll be back
How did mount miss that open net let alone not pass it to the choice of two in the box who were ready.
Honestly! Hats off to Lukaku! What a unit! Amazing run in the final minutes to win the penalty and game!
What a header by James!!
Great defending by Mings for Lukaku’s second... He just had to head it away...
Should have been 5 -1
Lukaku is one of the greatest player of all times give this man his flowers. Living legend rudiger very underrated also great passes great defender
I've held into lukaku for weeks in my fantasy football team. The week I take him out, he scores...
How was that not a red for Konsa?
Villa well beaten. Konsa shouldn't've bothered to foul Lukaku - he was waiting for it. Cash reckless. Villa should have taken their chances. And yet I hear Villa played well. Hardly matters does it?
Lukaku was absolutely brilliant today! I believe in you Rom!!! COYB 💙💙💙
Genuine question because the ref was still playing advantage before the second pen surely he should’ve pulled it back for the Free kick
"Lukaku can’t dribble" "Lukaku is a flop"  When he wants to play football, he will play football.
Can we talk about that Kansa challenge? If you watch the replay he goes down for the slide tackle but lukaku’s leg knocks him down and into lukaku himself. Not sure about that. Feel free to disagree
Pulisic Looked More Comfortable switching from CF to a RWB. Lukaku replacing Pulisic into his CF position and Reece james Drifting to CB. I am glad Tuchel made these decisions at the start of a second half to really change the Rhythm of the Game!!
Jorghinos justifying that ballond'or finish
Why did they cut out the commentary at the end where Lukaku “duldozered” his way through so annoying the league hates Chelsea. Smh
I went to the match as a villa fan we was so good 1st half second rubish
1:57 FREEZE FRAME 🤣 look at lukaku and Hudson-Odoi 🤣
Shhhh at the end of the Mach avfc
that run to win the penalty at the end from lukaku just shows his strength and pace waw!
Chelsea fans going on like they won the champions league today how embarrassing🤣🤣  2 penalties AGAIN shock horror.
HOURS AND HOURS OF BOXING DAY FOOTBALL EACH MORE CLIMATIC THAN THE LAST
welldone. can't stand Stevie G.
Think we can safely say Martinez is no longer ‘king of mind games’ lol
Hudson odoi was involved in all three goals  Underrated and overhated tbh
Not a football fan but how is that not a red card at the end???   Does a player have to commit literal murder on the pitch nowadays or something to be carded???
sorry but how has konsa only got a yellow for that challenge on lukaku?
Lukaku gave me Drogba vibes today man!
All their goals atm are literally coming from jorginho and penalties, if opposition stopped making stupid challenges in the box chelsea wouldnt even be top 4😂
Best ST in the league
01:55 when you do your best Khaby lame impression
Premier league is going to upload a ‘spectacular own goals’ video any second
That last run from Lukaku gave me chills - what an absolute beast of a man!
People say cheslea rely on penaltys now come on lukaku would have scored that last one if he wasn't brought down
Easy penalty decisions.
Lukaku can be to Chelsea what Mo Salah is to Liverpool and what CR7 is to Man Utd! When he came on it was like watching him at Inter 💥
About time
Chelsea beat villa mentally and the goals and mistakes just kept coming
Nice
It may seem easy just to put lukaku on. Let’s not forget who to take off an move positions of players   Tuchel is 2nd to none when it comes to in game management 👏🏼
Has Jorginho even scored anything other than penalties
Chelsea shirt looks like Borussia Dortmund.
Don't ever ever ever go down like that in the box running full pelt ridiculous defending
That lukaku header was class. respect for him coming off the the bench scoring that masterclass of a header!
Lukaku on the counter and run is phenomenal. But he can't do much in a possession based system apart from receiving crosses.
what is mings doing? also that 2nd pen is either no foul or a red, you cant give a yellow if its a foul because there is no additional cover
Look as soon as mason mount misses that sitter Lukaku and I think Hudson odoi  their reaction is so in sync
What is the actual point of Jorginho aside from scoring penalties?
Jorginho on pens... it’s like Art
Penchel or chelvar take your pick ..  lucky with penalties for 2nd game in a row
My gorginho, Mr perfection. The best penalty taker in the world
Lukaku has never struggled for Chelsea. Just hasn’t got enough game time since his injury. Also, Thiago Silva is incredible. Most underrated player in the world right now just because of his age. Easily one of the leagues best still at his age.
Luk who's back.
Lukaku is built like a beast
Penginho
Ez
Good win for Chelsea but they need to stop rating jorghino so highly .Only scores pens and places 3 in ballondor just because he won the euros. I have never seen him score a goal that is not a penalty. Overatted and gives away silly mistakes. Ps. NOT A CHELSEA FAN so roast me all you want but I’m just speaking facts.
Need Chelsea to come back and win the league but I doubt it
It's a difficult result , no Gerrard and 1-0 up we throw it away with 2 penalties,  on the other hand it's against top 3 so I dont know how to feel , disappointed with the manner of the result I suppose, its one of those results that will shape the rest of the season under Gerrard and one where we get to see how he gets the players back on track , lose the next game and we go back in to free fall.
Lukaku is actually showing his Inter form in that game. Hope he keeps it up, cuz we'll need him for this season!
Lukaku my man
ladies and gentlemen, december is coming to an end so is chelsea’s bad form
This Chelsea team can win trophy’s
Lukaku
Reece james has been quality this season, scoring another goal for us tonight, he’s on form 🔥
Reece james can’t stop scoring 🔥
Jorginho makes  me smile 💙
Penginho
Stevies WiFi must of stopped working😩
when  will jorghino score a non penalty goal.
The nets on Villas goals are 👌👌👌
☘☘⚡ CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB ⚡ IS COMING!!!! THUNDER FEEL THE THUNDER FIRST THE LIGHTNING ⚡ THEN THE THUNDER 👀☘☘
You cannot stop the shine
I can’t help but think CHO would thrive elsewhere on loan, like Conor. I think he’s a talented player but not really showing it with Chelsea
How we didn't get a pen I don't know I don't think VAR even checked it not to mention that last penalty wasn't a pen as Lukaku bumped into Konsa not the other way round. You may say it's offside but atleast double check especially as it's a pen shout  and how is playing mind games a yellow card like seriously  the pen taker and the keeper do mind games so it's not like a unfair advantage what's next there's going to be yellows for doing skills like Neymar football is in the mud.
Chelsea are good but the amount of penalties they've had this season suggests they're quite average in comparison to other sides
Arsenal and Tottenham will finish above Chelsea, can't believe that this joke of a club won the Champions League
Chelsea have a weapon in Jorginho. Very jealous. As soon as there is a penalty there is every chance he puts it away
Aston Vile got the skelping they deserved
The Animal is back with a bang  Well Played Team Blues..... Forca Chelsea 💙..... Blue Bleed ....
Lets go! 💙💙
Penginho
Another 2 pens for the pen merchant
Haha villa, won’t be a top 6 team for many seasons to come, can beat teams like Norwich but when it comes to Chelsea, lose every season apart from last. Lost to Liverpool and Man City too, bang average prem side nothing more. There fans think they’re something they’re not!!
HOW IS THAT NOT A RED CARD?!?!?!?!
Smoking on that Villa pack 😈
If only our games were postponed until lukaku came back 😭
As a villa fan i still have a feeling that somehow we couldve won this match against chelsea tbf
What was Mings doing on that first Lukaku goal. 6 ft 5 inches and he did nothing. Come on now Tyrone.
Let’s gooo!!! 👏👏👏👏
Hopefully this build momentum I can’t believe how unlucky we got with our injuries and covid really turning the 3 horse race into 2
Lukaku has been missed 💙
Jorginho pen merchant
I came here for the lukaku goal
I hate being negative I promise, but Tyrone Mings just isn't good enough for what we are looking to achieve, as soon as Lukaku came on he looked like he just didn't want to be anywhere near him, taking absolutely nothing away from Chelsea but we simply don't have the players to challenge for Europe.
Callum hudson odoi is so good
Pen merchant Jorginho
Now hopefully city can drop points
Where are all the people who called lukaku a flop foolish rival fans
All Jorginho can do is take penalties
I don’t care Jorginho better start getting destroyed by the media and fans, the biggest penalty merchant off all time and the biggest stat padder of all time not even the best midfielder at Chelsea!
Penalty Merchant...
Lukaku came on at half time and completely changed the game and got Man Of The Match. If you think Chelsea are better without Lukaku then you’re simply deluded. He makes this team 10x better. What a player.
Seriously I don't get our team. We cross 40 times in the first half. Then lukaku comes on and we only do 2 crosses all of the second half. One we scored from and the other we looked dangerous.
Great to see Lukaku score but can we agree that Jorginho is a pen merchant and stole Lukaku's winner.
Lukaku is back to feast 🦁
As soon as Kante and Kovacic get minutes in a match, we see their impact in offense and defence, now we look more comfortable in tough games, most importantly BIG ROM IS BACK!! 💙
1:58 the players were synchronised as heck.
Junior DROGBA
😳👍
You can see how lukaku makes a big difference , that brute strength reminds of our game against Arsenal
LUK WHOS BACK what an impact he had off the bench
We are back
