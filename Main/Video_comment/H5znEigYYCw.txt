Imagine if Kier Starmer had the balls the just scurry off into the weeds. Instead he continues to have the worst approval ratings of any PM.
I never knew I could thoroughly enjoy listening to someone enunciate the letter p.
Glad you put "(for now)"  Reports saying he may join the election campaign. Yippee!! Another nail in the thoroughly nailed coffin for the Tories
He is oddly linkable to every political death. He has protected the local mafias before, why? He is highly probably one too. The law says he is responsible so is his dad for defending him. How can anyone believe anything he says.
I think its misguided and/or wrong to tell that BJ is thick. He is quite smart, and therefore he fully understands what he is doing.
Borris reminds me of davith the only gay in the village
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Boris is just like Nero - he partied while the country burned!  How many people banned from seeing their elderly relative's before they died or visit sick people in hospital.  He underestimates the people of this country if he thinks he will ever hold power in this country again; especially those he ordered arrested for being outside - this traitor should never be in any position of authority again. I think his ministers and all those involved in flouting the rules they levied on the people of this country belong in prison - no exceptions!
Good job at keeping the people complacent, Jonathon. Without you placating my anger with silly skits, I'd actually put that energy into involving myself in politics  Nevermind, we need people like you to tow the line and pretend to be a rebel, while really helping the tories by keeping the insignificant crimes in the limelight instead of the serious crimes, like Bozza's involvement with the Russian oligarch Lebedev's, we don't want the public to get wise  Your service is the comedic version of James O'Brien, another fake rebel towing the tory lines and distracting the public  See you all in the final days of humanity, when the consequences of your actions are fully realised  I can only hope that karma is painfully real
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂😂 Best quote I’ve heard in a long time. Gonna use that in future conversations 👍🏻
😂
Johnathan try being neutral ya lefty
I’m really hoping Labour gets in next. I know JP will get stuck in as soon as he’s given a good reason! I wonder what it will be? Oooo the anticipation.
"....looks like a boiled swede in a hoover bag" 😂
What should bother Brexiters is that they followed Boris (Father of Lies) and voted leave 😂😂
Bet he voted for Blair. Made up dossier.  Over 100k die. Gets a knighthood. No rant about him. Not buying it
Bang on! 👏
I love you Jonathan Pie! Funny how all those brexiters don’t want to focus on his lies now and think about how much lies went into that campaign what a complete travesty
Jonathan Pie 🤝for the truth
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legend 😂😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
This could apply to Australia’s PM Scott Morrison.
Yer spot on kid
A “gaslighting bag, of … gas”.  Gold.  Will never get old.
Johnson wants less humans on this earth (he admits it in his books)and his father is part of planned parenthood. Both eugenicists. Yet his misses is pushing them out once a year! What a bloody hypocrite. We need less Johnson’s not more .
Amazing you slag off a man who had cake but you say huw the sick bully is an ok guy . Hilarious hypocrite
"a boiled sweet in a hoover bag...." HAHAHAHAHAHA that's 1st class.
Don't hold back, Mr. Pie, tell us how you really feel.
I'm very glad there is a real boris denier.Boris himself was absolutely wrong yet at least he had a go bucco.
you brits make fun of north american politics a lot but you don't seem to have your bed made
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag. 😂😂😂
❤
I knew the C word would make an appearance. Bravo.
Nice to see someone with a backbone. Thanks again JP!
Do not understand  I call boris a wanker on utube,then I'm smacked in the hand banned for 23 hours ?Jonathan watch your bank account and your back,keep up the good work ,your humour is outstanding, I'm passing myself, not because of age,❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Pie for pieminister
Summed the bastard up to a T. !
A self centered narcissist who's in bed with the Russian's. A bag of piss is Boris.
Jason Farrell Sky News is a clone of this character 😮I kid you not! The manerisms with the hands looking directly and down to the camera while berating whoever is the subject of a 'Sky Exclusive'. Even the suit and tie is 'Pieesque'  Tom Walker must be in awe that an actual newsreader/reporter(term used very losely as it Sky ffs!) who has no personality per se has to 'mimic' his creation to present real stories to the GP. Some may say.... I'm imagining it...😂😂😂 So go ahead look him up today Friday 30th June 2023 reporting on the police undercover sex scandal.  Enjoy. ❤
I would LOVE to see you on Question Time! 😂
The master of insults
"Boris looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag"..... can't unsee that now...
Love your rants....hits the nail on the head every time
Perfectly expressed! Johnson is a LFC!
Well that covers it quite neatly.
Da, that's a proper and truthful rant rather freshing
Well said Jonathan. Saying what many know and feel johnson is a con-man, liar and bully
Could you have a look at my MP please?  Douglas Ross current MP for Moray.
The unbelievable thing is that many deluded Tory voters think that he's great. They should all watch this 50 times until the truth sets in.
Well said,  Well said.  👍😉
A boiled sweet in a Hoover Bag. Brilliant.
This show used to be a funny sketch, now it’s just an angry man ranting and insulting everyone. Such a shame…
Please sit down Pie, your takes are awful!
Nice to hear your dulcet tones again Pie! No BS and no fear. Another fucking fantastic news report...... or a message to Boris directly! Keep shouting it out loud Jon ✊️
Report on Wagner mutiny.😅
Lol, Fik as shit. and yes, thick spelled by a thick oaf
Fat kids like cake. Smart kids like Pie.
You could say Boris was and is damaged goods then.
It's always funny watching Johnson getting eviscerated but this type of episode is a bit predictable and isn't as clever and satirical as the ones where Tom (Jonathan) acts like he's genuinely in-between broadcast takes. That c-bomb was great though 😂
I love to hear Jonathan Pie!
I think at this point Boris is liar but let’s not forget the conservatives that put him in that position and knew exactly what he was but then when I started to become a liability they throw him right under that bus to try and wash their hands with him and try and come out smelling of roses never let the rest get away with putting him in the position in the first place because they are just as guilty as him.
Not for now the people of britain DONT want him back at all for God's sake he's dpne enough damage to our country.
Genius as always
I am wondering how it is that this person is considered funny/incisive/erudite.  He is simply telling us in a sweary, semi-articulate way that he hates Boris Johnson.  I suggest that he collects his thoughts beforehand, writes down his lines (or gets someone else to do so), and then learns and delivers those lines like a professional performer would.
Tell it like it is, love it.
Pie is nothing but a shill of the Establishment. If he understood how things rally work he would also be telling you that all the partys are fake and only their to take away the fact that the Establishment run the show and the fake Government are only their to take the flak when things go tits up.
Genius. Huge fan of JP. Always absolutely nails the truth when there is so much bullshit in the world of politics. Ironic that the comedy and satire speaks the truth when the politics, which should be truthful, is now the fiction.
It’s good to see you again. Please come do some US news correspondence. It’s magical
Boris is a complete Johnson.
Very good. Now do Starmer and Kormagate.
👏👏👏👏👏
Jonathan, I think your  being very kind to Boris. I thought he might be OK, as a leader, but he's a two faced lying f----r. How easily he's duped the public. Great stuff, more please.
Fookin spot on bruv! Agree wholeheartedly
Thanks Mr. Pie - watched the clip during breakfast. Best way to start the day!
Amen.
The real news. Now back to the tidal wave of distractive retarded propoganda BS of mainstram media.
This is what the concurrent demonstration of courage, compassion and wisdom looks like. All humans could benefit from this level of dignity. Thankyou JP.
As an Aussie, I always appreciate hearing Jonathan cussing his mouth off, it helps remind you that journos are human too and do get sick of some of the fucking morons they have to report on.
To the foul mouthed Jonathon Pie, You have lost your mind. You are possessed by Satan the deceiver, the liar, the “Talking snake” of life, the evil one within all men (post puberty and adolescence) when we have changed and are no longer that young, innocent and harmless (naked) child of whom we once were. Where our many dishonest and immoral (secretive) thoughts of unruly temptation are the demons within us. But you are blind to yourself, in the way that Hitler was blind to himself and in the same way that all leading religious preachers of all religions are blind to themselves.  “Away with you Satan; you are a stumbling block to me. You think as man thinks, not as God thinks.” – (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 16: 23) –
Johnathan sounds on the fence about Boris.
He will be back like Trump. Trump's latest speeches are definitely written with AI that knows detailed voter demographic profiles and decades of advertising psychology expertise. He sounds like winning over yank sentiment over there and Boris Johnson has the equivalent latent working class lad fascism festering in Britain.
Running off like a wounded balloon 😂
Johnson needs to have the limelight so he won't be content with newspaper columns however much money they throw at him. A new political party to cater for rightwing codgers and barflies will be set up with overseas funding from billionaire backers but the weight of public opinion seems to have shifted away from his cult, not least because there are so many other preoccupations than brexit to worry about. The messiah didn't walk on water after all and we are all  paying the price.
What a pity he wasn't free to really let us know what he thinks about Boris . . .
Another exquisite rant, he nails it time and time again. I love this guy.
He’s a politician… expecting anything more than a lying scumbag is a little bit naive… you get what you pay for, keep voting and you’ll keep getting lying scumbags
Wonderfully put Jonathan 👏
Truth. As always, JP
Of course he’s a bully and a liar, he’s a tory. It’s in their DNA.
Listening here in the US. Boris is another Trump.
Ill tell you we keep going into agreement on being conned in everyway possible by those who control everything yet we out number them thousands too one actually its time we turned the tables on them now before we lose everything in life isnt it or is the message still NOT GETTING HOME YET
So why is he in public life at all hes a f****** Embarrasment too the British public how did this country stoop so low
Johnathan to say he is a conspiracy pendling person thats an insult to conspiracy theorists
Booked my ticket for Feb 2nd. Can't wait.
100% correct but... still they support him. It's not Johnson that's broke, not even the tories. It's the (mainly) English voting public who are brain dead.
Johnathan... just an amazing critique.
We have missed you so much!
Reporting on Boris or Trump.....pretty much the same.
I can only hope that Jonathan will turn his eye to all parties with his new show on BBC Sounds. Yes, Johnson is a twat of the highest order. But so is Starmer, and that deputy of his. So is Sturgeon, and her cronies. So are the liberals (no one knows their names). I said Sturgeon was jumping before the shi*t hit the fan and was called anti-Scots. Well it didn't take long for the truth to come out. Just like Johnson though, she will get away with it and become a lobbyist. They're all bent as F*CK !!!!
Do you see now why we here in the US compared Boris Johnson to Donald Trump? Liars adulterers and prone to conspiracy theories.
No longer comedy or parody. A real and accurate description of the facts..
Bravo Mr "Pie" - bloody brilliant (and as ever, spot-on) rant! Thank you again! :-)
Jonathan pie should be the top MP interviewer  I would pay to watch .
I love your documentaries Jonathan.  Bravo Sir.
You don’t like Boris then? Don’t sit on the fence
I wish I could be this coherent and intelligent when I'm angry. Sweary I can manage. I've certainly called Johnson an F'ing C-word on occasions.
Boris Johnson is a fu**ing liar. Who would've known?
is conspiracy theorist even a slur anymore though, I mean, how many have actually come true this last while ffs
Wow
@JonathanPie you would be excellent presenting Channel 4’s election night coverage
So what...? We all know all of this Pie... You call him a, "pussy" and a "coward"...   So as a hero that you might yet be...   Call for action....?  Or... Are you just happy, calling out the obvious for profit? Profiting from calling out the obvious....  If you are, you're complicit.  If you're not, I'm with you.  What are you? Pussy or hero?
I wish you wouldn't hold back Jonathan 😂😂😂 Absolutely spot on mate 👍👍👍
Bojo's kids will have to hear "your dad's a liar" for the rest of their lives, his wife has to somehow come to terms with her husband is a liar and can't be trusted - laugh it up bellend
'thank you colin' 😅😅😅😅
Goes to show how stupid the electorate was for voting for him.
Pie, you save me the massive headache of explaining to others my personal feelings… I just play your videos to them, you say it as clear as glass 😂😂
Brilliant. I love the guy
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂 What a description!
Cant help feel we would be a lot better off if news reporters could actually be like this
Where's Tim?
Well Said.
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag, took me out!
Accurate 😂 checkout "Richard Vobes"
Thank you, Colin.
You pushed vaccines on everyone mate so how’s about an apology ?? I didn’t take your advice by the way !!
So twat Boris partied??? What about the dancing prancing tick tok nurses , you gonna call them out ?
Pie for Prime Minister ,mate give it a go. if "a boiled sweet in a hoover bag'"can do it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love it!
Pig in a hay bale!😂😂😂😂😂
Stop beating around the bush and tell us what you think of Boris 😏
“We” (collectively) as a nation voted for him though didn’t we? Thus we have all got what we deserved. Never mind the man with the fast hands
Such a legend..❤
How the f@ck did Boris ever get to be prime minister.....it beggers belief
SUBFUCKINGSCRIBED
Disappointed not to hear the word tw#t used - Boris is surely is the biggest of all time
If anything, I think JP might be understated in his assessment of BJ
Loving your BBC Sounds series mate, binge listened while at work. Please do more, and for the love of god BBC, give this man and his team a televised sitcom.
I wish Jonathan Pie would gift America to his opinion of our own Boris, namely the orange menace. I enjoy your rants immensely sir.  Thank you.
I don't understand Pie's outrage. Johnson is the natural product of representative democracy, whereby ordinary people - ignorant, foolish, thoughtless - get to vote for the most amusing and entertaining imbeciles. Just like Trump, Johnson succeeded because millions of ordinary people voted for him. So unless Pie accepts that democracy is a catastrophically stupid idea, his outrage at Johnson's lies is misplaced. It is precisely because Johnson is such a lying buffoon that he was, and continued for many to be, so very popular among the crowds.
At last - the TRUTH  about Bojo the lying 🤡
And most of they wankbags down south would still vote him back in.
A wounded balloon 🤣
When Jonathan Pie says the word "cunt", it feels like the knockout blow in a fight. So cathartic and scathing. I love it.
Any Daily Mail readers watching?
I presume, fair to say he is not on your Christmas card list Jonathan?
We all know Johnson and Trump are conjoined twins separated at birth. It's great to see them both falling in holes of their own making. BTW, don't usually use that word but I could listen to you say c%*t over and over. Beautiful work!
Was waiting for the c-bomb, and there it was! Well played JP!
I'm constantly accused of 'confirmation bias' because I expect the Tories to be criminally corrupt. And sure enough, everywhere I look, I see evidence of this. Perhaps they're on to something.
Who needs mainstream media?? Just get the news here!!!
I bet Bobo wouldn't be such a big man if confronted by a member of the public, tosser would be on his ass in seconds.
Mr Pie, legend.
FYI, you lost me when you started supporting masks and Vax !
He was itching to go, he craved money and whilst PM gave him power it didn't pay him enough.
Love you Jonathan! Keep it coming!
Hmm... Interesting... We have one of those here in the states.  Well, to be honest, more than one. Several, actually.
Probably the first time Johnson has recieved real consequences for his actions. Essentially a globe spanning condemnation of his behaviour. Everything else up this point has been an innefectual slap on the wrist.
The Pie says it as it is 👍
but what do you REALLY think about Boris?    :D
Pie would get my vote if he stood for election. Can you imagine a debate in the commons with Pie on his feet?
Don't sit on the fence, tell us what you think!
Pie's videos are lights in the dark ❤
I just saw the illigal covid party video: such a nice start for the Bring Back Boris party...or should I say: parties?
😂 Don’t know why anyone’s so surprised and astounded by the depths of depravity the ruling classes will go to to retain power and the only difference between ALL those Westminster muthafukas is Johnson wasn’t afraid to flaunt his sense of entitlement and now the rest OF THAT MUTHAFUKIN cabal up there has had to bandy together to prove that they’re not ALL like that, honest. 😂😂😂 “Thick as shit” twat, I bet he’s even surprised that he got thrown under the bus… no honour amongst thieves… so speaks the 61 year old Welsh anarchist who’s never been dumb enough to put her name to ANY of those disingenuous muthafukas up there 😂 Democracy, a 1000’s of years old system that was a fuck up when it was invented and, despite 1000’s of years practice is still a fuck up… believers, man, how much time does this system need before it’s perfected? You do know it’s not the only game in town, yeah?
Thank you Colin.
Police at the time stated there was  not enough evidence to “disprove the version of events provided by attendees”.  So if the statements provided to the police are contradicted by this new evidence doesn't that mean these people are potentially guilty or the far more serious offence of perverting the course of justice?
Lest we forget… this one should be carved in stone until the occasion of Mr Johnston’s death
Johnson lying all through and causing fear amongst the people is nothing less than terrorism! He should be treated as such
I'm curious to hear Jonathan's thoughts on the honours list!
How has no one in Boris’s presence not dropped him yet??
I need JP in a 3 way (steady) phone call with myself and my sister, we rant about wanker politicians every time we talk😊
Didn't May sack him as Foreign Secretary for slipping his security and disappearing to the Lebedev Italian Villa and lying about it?
Go look at a photo of the girl who was his asssitant for a few months and is now a lord..
Thankyou for vocalising what we're all thinking
Like father, like son..........in this case!
Beautiful. And only cos that cnut Colin got back in his ear did we not get to listen to Pies rant for another 10 mins or so. FU Colin.
Glad I don't live in the UK, it seems every week you guys have a new prime minister
Greatest Boris Rant, great comedy.
Who bloody cares, there's more important than crap
I came here for the satire. There was none, just 100% truth. Joshson is such a fucking bellend he's simply a caricature of satire.
Johnson the swamp creature, indeed. But what about all those c*nts that voted for him, and the ones who even now would vote for him? Beggars belief.
"pussy" is misogynistic / homophobic? Even worse..... American!
Omg. So spot on, JP!
Get off the fence and say what you really mean 😂
Let me explain if someone on the left drinks beer eats cake during lockdown that is okay, but if you are on the right that is wrong hence some person do not understand the law only applies if you are right wing.
He fights for his innocents with tax payers money... the Baboon is still laughing and enjoying the show as it is not going to costs him nothing... Shameless piece of dirt.
Boris is the type of annoying kid you want to kick the shit out of at school. Rees-Mogg, Sunak all of them are the self absorbed, privileged people that unfortunately destroy this country for their own entertainment.
I think the line from 'The thick of it' applies to Boris - "You're like the guy that fucked the monkey that gave us AIDS... you're saying 'it's not me, it's not me' but you got monkey shit on your balls, not me."
Just imagine if he stolen money from party funds like jimmy cranky! Not just had cake,
Just. Fucking. Awesome. 😂
Boris speaks nonsense and laughs when you take him seriously. It's your fault for believing him. Not his. By the way I'm not a Boris Supporter. I'm couldn't be happier he has gone and gone so embarrassingly as well. Bring on the schadenfreude. I'm not even going to hide it. The worst prime minister in the history of Britain! I'm just so glad we can now say this openly and we don't have to waste our lives being balanced about this twat!
Once again brilliant
Just like Fu&kin Trump!
This a great video, I learn alot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me. building steady income is quite difficult for newbies.Thanks to Sophia for improving my portfolio,keep up with good videos.
JP 4 PM!
Once upon a time, Jonathan Pie was quite funny.  It’s a bit of a tired character.  This guy needs to do something fresh and new, it’s got pretty old.
This is his best work by far. He’s somehow managed to channel a lot of my anger in 3 mins. Keep up the great work Jonathan!
I think Mr Pie is holding back a little on his criticism of Boris Johnson!  Is he concerned about offending our sensibilities with strong language?
I love Jonathan Pie 😊
Privilage and hierarchical delusion.... often means there is apparently an honor to being a self righteous, deluded, lying, cheating arsehole
If boris dies we party
How I wish I were this articulate.
Legend💝
I don't care for Tories or Labour, but when this guy speaks I listen ..and laugh my arse off.
Johnson a complete tool
While I think that this guy is outstanding; it's a sad day when you have to go to a satirist for the honest, concise and accurate information in current affairs...
I suppose you have taken Boris off your Xmas card list?
This the original RRREEEEEEE guy?
Here here!! But the sad reality is he just walks away with no accountability 😡🤬😡
we got your back
Can Jonathan do one about that Liar and bully Starmer too?
Superb as always x
Excellent, brilliant commentary as always from Jonathan Pie 👏🏼 👏🏼
If only the media could say it like JP
WOW Breaking news Politicians lie 🥴
Has Pie mentioned the Mayor Labour stitched up?
Johnson is an idiot. Every job he's ever had he had screwed  up and still got to be our P.M its who he know who is protecting him.
I really wish you wouldn't hold back.😂
What a disgusting rant, he wasn't the only PM, President, Leader etc. etc. to 'lie' they are all liars, and bullying is prolific in any society from time immemorial, how can you represent your constituents views if you allow yourself to be bullied.
I have missed you Jonathan. I am glad you are back.
Ah, the Trump defence.
'Boiled sweet in a hoover bag' is a fucking burn for the ages. Hats off to you sir.
JP should get an honour for telling the truth as we can't rely on our politicians to do that. 👏
"Foie gras infused liquid shit". Dear God Mr Pie you couldn't be any more brilliant 👏👏👏
Great show. The problem is the hard right adore lying politicians. They would believe 100 lies rather than one inconvenient truth
That's all that needs to be said really. Very well put.
You said exactly what we all know him to be. Thank you for that. I still can't believe that anybody was ever taken in by him. I hope you are all ashamed of yourselves for wanting this clown in power!
It's not the only thing Boris lied about either.........
It’s all true.Brilliant Mr Pie absolutely spot on.
The web address at the end is misspelled. Other than that - brilliant - keep up the brilliant work 👍👍🤩🤩😎😎
A J Pie and Frankie Boyle "talking politics tour" please.  Could the planet handle it?
Why are you so vexed about everything? It can't be good for you, surely
I don't get why people keep attacking former Prime Minister Johnson. It is not like he mislead Parliament or something. Every word he has said has been 100% spot on, when the fullness of time is taken into account. Don't believe me? Consider when he said flat out that there was no party. At the time, people were skeptical about the remark. But now we know, there is no Conservative Party anymore!
Could be talking about trump
You're correct. Johnson is "a person who, in fact, has done nothing but spray his foie gras-infused liquid shit all over our constitution, and all over our Parliamentary procedures."  If you could see your way to ranting just as scathingly about our lack of democracy - because FPTP is after all a scam, not a democratic electoral system - that would be super-helpful.
He is the devious cronies with Portsmouth Russian warships and blame it on yourselves Boris bog brush the seven sins of greed.
"a boiled sweet in a hoover bag" - class :)
You Poms just noticed eh! #BoristheButcher .
😂
Similar with his pal across-the-pond to the west .. ?
Sure that's not Scott Morrison he's talking about?
Noble Prize stuff. Greatest poet of our times.
can't wait to see him in southampton next year
Are the MPs expelled from the Commons for calling him a liar going to receive an apology?
Love it.
Yes, it was known that he was an absolute self absorbed before he was elected, but the dim-witted electorate voted for him. Says a lot  about the intelligence of UK citizens, sadly.
Thank you J.P. Always a pleasure to hear from you.
Just look at the number of thumbs up vs thumbs down.  The Pie nails is once more!!!  All hail The Pie!!
This view is probably flawed in that we should hold boris to account  But I don’t care about boris  I don’t think he should be punished for rules broken during lockdown as 95% of people probably did as well and they too shouldn’t be punished. I’m more concerned about being led by more liars who make decisions that seem to represent none of the citizens of this country and seem to chuck us under the bus every time their stocks fall in value. At least they capped fuel prices though.. at 4x the amount they originally were.
For us in Europe Boris was hilariously  entertaining. Miss the old jester
Shut Eton down forever
Rather more complimentary about thick boris than I would be.
Just Brilliant & too the point🙏😂
Wasn't his talent the thing the Brits voted for?
Oooh it looks like he doesn't like Boris 🤣
Jonathon used to be really funny but this was just overtly political, rather vulgar trash talking. A shame to see a great comic resort to simply hurling unfunny abuse at an individual, whatever your thoughts on Boris are.
The question is, which we'll never be able to know. Was it on purpose to mislead the country, or is he just insanely stupid?
But don't talk about the war!
No what it was all about Was  "We lock you all down for a deadly virus of which we really didn't care or was worried about at all But it's going to be a really good money spinner for all of us elites straight out of the pockets of you working tax paying imbeciles
Like he renounce USA citizenship 👍 Boris Johnson
Just brilliant 👏
VOTE PIE!!!!!!!! <-------- The UK needs this man to run things - get someone in who actually tells the fucking TRUTH!!!!! <3
So what you saying...
It's been too long Sir. Good to see you again.
Yet Rishi gets away with it.
Bozzo has been the maker of his own downfall telling lies from an early rubbish journalist to an even rubbish liying PM,but he's just bought a £6m pound house so he is ok in current cost of living crisis.
😂😂😂😂😂....brilliant love you Johnathan.
People STILL back him,that sums up the idiocy of this Countries voters.
I'm so glad he is setting fire to the Tory Party. Maybe next time they will be more mindful of the country when selecting a leader.
That sums Johnson, I suppose...🤣🤣
All of this is true, but the saddest thing is, and let's be honest here, no-one is really going to do anything. The man has been openly racist, untruthful and bullied those against him and yet we do nothing. We all know they control the police, the courts, even the voting system and that there's no legal way out, and yet we do nothing. At what point does the blame shift from people like him to people like us?
I’m a lyricist/singer in a band. 30 years experience, but Pie spills words like a warrior. Nothing but love Sir. Nothing but love. I stand in awe.
A boiled sweet in a Hoover bag!!!      Brilliant!😁😁
To call him a pig is an insult to pigs🐖🐖🐖
And yet people still vote Tory! Why?! They are a party of liars who’ve had 13 YEARS to sort this nation out! They’ve made things worse, whilst becoming increasingly and openly corrupt (and authoritarian) with each iteration! I don’t particularly like the current state of Labour, but if you want these idiots gone, they’re the only choice. Perhaps we could even have a proper referendum on Proportional Representation (which would mean that every single vote mattered)
Now the republican party needs to take the same stance with Trump (fat chance).
We need you to give us the news more often.
i don't give a fig about the parties                          the concerning thing is that they must have all known that  this virus wasn't a big problem to the majority   but still ruined the economy on the back of it                               imposed lockdowns  - stopped visits to  sick and dying relatives and  traumatised kids for years to come    -  never forgive and never forget
Boris need to be taken out to the back of the wood shed...
Go Pie! 😂
The F-ing joke is that the people of uk voted for to be pm, like the USA voted for Trump.
I think the queen died because Bories lied to her all the time and she just couldn't take it anymore. She was witness of the most brutal war to this date, multiple economic crisis, how the UK joined and left the EU, multiple health crisis, but what broke her back was that Boris lied to her.
Amazing your channel is the only one I can comment on thanks to the algorithm.   Why is your channel not popular.  Coz of the algorithm.    Dam man you deserve to be honoured by the Queen rolling in her golden grave
Johnathan Pie telling it like it is.
If a channel gave this man a news show i'd stop watching their competitors.
I'm just a Yank but this guy is awesome.  We Americans appreciate the UK showing solidarity with our Tangerine Tyrant by electing a bloviating idiot of yer own.  As America collapses in the flames of white racist evangelical Christian Fascism Brexit was a perfect English response.
Save that speech for when trump is booted out😂
I fart in his general direction
Love you
It’s his corruption that grinds my gears.
Who else lost it at 'boiled sweet in a Hoover bag'?!!
1:59 Wasn't ready for this part. I now have coffee all over my monitor, thanks Pie.
If he's looking for more material he should do an American spin-off. We've got lying bullies in public office for days.
"Boiled sweet in a Hoover bag" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. A perfect of description of Boris
One day. Jonathon will come off the fence and say what he thinks. Meanwhile, anyone who disagrees with his comments must be as deranged as the blonde scarecrow. Trouble is, the narcissistic nonce will undoubtedly stage a come back.
Ah. So the UK has one of those too. Fortunately for the UK his party didn't back his lies.
A wounded balloon !
Spot on JP. I just pray that time does not Diminish the corrupt behaviour that Johnson, his cronies and the wider Tory elites have foisted upon Britain. Time for change.
Someone should start a class action suit against the government for all the people fined during lockdown.
Yes, yes, that's all very well but tell us what you really think 😂 Jonathan Pie's anger leaves me at peace.  He is on point and funny in equal measure.
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag. Brilliant.
3:18
Edit this and dub in Trump for Boris. If you stopped to think about the world of these sorts of clowns out there: Orban, Putin, Xi, Kim, Maduro, Lukashenko, Min Aung Hlaing, Modi... you might start believing in the End Times.
Jonathan should be cloned and make sure that every nation gets one.
Oh that was just what I was thinking, thank you Mr Pie 👍
Imagine if we all felt like Jonathan, Boris would not have even been voted in as Prime Minister. I am afraid its the British Voters that are the problem. Boris has always been a clown that no one should take serious.
My thoughts exactly. Thank you!
Jonathan Pie needs to be a senior political correspondent on a news channel, that way the viewers can actually hear what we’re all thinking, without being drip fed bullshit nonsense
Trump and BOJO must have the same dna.
Did you both have the same hairdreser?
This is the voice I hear in my head whenever I see the news. Jonathan Pyle helps me  not to feel like I’m insane.
I started my morning with a slice of Jonathan pie and coffee…😁🤣🤣🤣❤️thanks.
Anglos are typically morally iffy
02.39 "A gaslighting bag of gas ..." Good But "a gaslighting bag of stale farts"  would have been better. Good work
Best one yet.
Awesome brother Mr Pie. It's been too long since you have been speaking the truth.  Carry on you excellent word speaking genuineness human😂❤🎉💪🤬🤬🤣😠❤️
Too the point the truth and funny as fuck 😂😂
I urgently need to hear Jonathan's take on Boris's "honours list."  That Jacob Rees-Mogg got a peerage...! Please, Jonathan, lance the boil!
Wonder if he renew his USA passport and then emigrate to visit friend in prison? He'd be a good Fridge salesman - if he can find his way out.
A fine summary sir!😂
Always game for a slice of Pie.
Prime Minister of the Ukraine. A cross between the bully Harry Flashman and Billy Bunter.
"A boiled sweet inside a hoover bag"
And I thought that Boris Johnson was a Russian penis
Maybe, so.  But the people who are outraged by this man's character are the same ones who knew him for years yet still pushed him out to the front to sell us Brexit and, as a consequence, succeed in keeping Corbyn out of No 10.  There is no bus that none of these despicable lowlifes would not throw ANYONE under. Thick as thieves, birds of a feather.  The abusive relationship which the Brits are victims of carries on unabated. The pantomime rolls on unchecked and undamaged.  But hey, it gives us an opportunity to avoid any responsibility for changing any of it or standing up against it because we can have a good old bellyache about it and we'll settle for that, as we have always done.  As an old Navy captain of mine said one day  "Good! I'm glad that the mean are happy to have something to be unhappy about!" when he heard of rumblings of discontent among the lower decks as the age-old 'one rule for them, one rule for us' card was played as the officers ( born to rule class) were exempt from an order for the rest of the ships company.  And we mimic it down through our own personal power and command structures, as illusionary and trivial as they may be.  We could call it 'British Values'.
If Boris committed a crime then so did Stammer  and his side kick who were both pushing for even more insane lockdowns but yet hmmmm all quiet on that front
You don't need to be a psychiatrist to see the narcissistic/psychopathic character traits of Boris Johnson. And that is to put it mildly not using the word disorder. And yet more than 50% of the population of the UK voted him in. Similar to the US where Trump was voted in and may be again.  That in itself is fascinating to observe.
The SWAMP is a little cleaner today, just now need to get shot of the rest of the detritus ;-)
'Call Jonathan Pie' on BBC Sounds is hilarious, I ❤ Tom Walker
What is Jonathan Pie even for anymore? He used to be funny.
What’s J Pie going to rant about next, his protege has gone??
Boris was the last British prime minister to ACTUALLY BE VOTED INTO POWER. There have been 2 since then. Both doing an even worse job than him. Liebour won the local elections here. We have seen a 96% rise in buisness rates.....  next will be your income tax. Raised to 40 to 70% of your earnings. But hey. You pricks will still vote for a party who started a war illegally and sold all our gold reserves to thier mates for a fraction of its value.
And now Sunak is the front man trying to steady the tory ship 😂 its tragic there's still tory voters out there
I don't know why any of the other political parties use Mr Pie's rants at PMQs. 😂
Absolutely f'in brilliant and spot on, as ever
I am beginning to think Pie does not like Boris Johnson very much.
3 month suspension, a harsh punishment?????
No punishment is enough for him, honestly.  If anyone without his privilege did as much harm to the nation as he did they'd never see daylight again.  Let's not kid ourselves - its yet another slap on the wrist.
He looks like a boiled sweet in a Hoover bag 🤭😂🤣😂🍬🙈😂🤣😂🤧  🤭😂🤣😂🤣😂
Quite possibly the best one yet.
no words apart from brilliant .....as always
Spot on Jonathan once again
spot on
Why can't genuine news presenters be so honest?
Actually, his "punishment" was a slap on the wrist.
Totally agree. One of the finest politicians of our era.
Really the funniest part of this Cultish devotion is how Rishi Sunak is so uncomfortable to do anything like he's terrified that Boris will spill the bean on him, really I said it at the time all the PartyGaters should have been barred from the front benches
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂😂😂
Bravo Jonathan!!! 🎉🎉🎉
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏Encore! Encore! Encore ! 🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣absolutely spot on 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤
Pie for PM !
Boris Johnson - “This is Your Life”!  Now feck orf!
Genius - another classic and scathing 'rant'. So many spot on comments to. Joyous to watch.
"A boiled sweet in a hoover bag." The finest jest ever jested.
He Biggest SCAM was covid !!!😳
Jonathan speaks from the heart as always. Favourite insults: "looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag" and "wounded balloon"
I wonder if he is prone to egoist suicide?  His narcissism is extraordinarily unconstrained.
boris should've stuck w/ ancient greek - he was pretty good at that.
I love your reporting! I love the way you tell it as it is! I would go farther.. Johnson is a fat C U Next Tuesday! 🤘🏴‍☠️🎭
That’s one hell of a rant 😂 ! Isn’t it horrifying to think people voted for Boris ? ( independent of political views) .
Ok but when's the tour  coming to california??
On point! As always! ✊
So, Mr. Pie, *how do you REALLY feel about Boris Johnson?*  😇🤔
every mp is a liar
Firing off at Boris implies that he's the only villain and all the other politicians are angels... Which is clearly not true.
I'll bet Theresa May doesn't look too bad now. Truss preceded by Johnson. Dear God. The former an utter incompetent, the latter an abject liar. Are they the best  the Conservative party can offer? Surely not.
As a Dutch teacher of Engish I learn a lot from his speeches. Wonderful! And as far as Boris, good riddance.
yo lad stop yelling it wasn't us!
So good, so funny, so true, you are like a fine wine and continue to get better with age, keep up the good work
You're fucking fantastic Jonathan Pie.
3:18, nailed it
You forgot the bit about him lacking any actual leadership talent......
He also looks like a cursed Ed sheeran
Thanks a million ❤
Wondered where you’ve been, nothing snide to say about Roshi Sumac?
Boris didn't ask for covid to happen on his watch.
well, british politics is fucked still
I love this. But it would be improved with someone calling 'cut' (or whatever the correct word is) and then a brief testy disagreement, followed by the monologue. I want to be the frustrated guy (lol) calling cut!
Boris' reincarnation will be an orange combover
jail him for treason  - make an example of him
comb yer hair.
And now he's back to lying as a columnist in the Daily Mail, breaking the ministerial code while doing it!
Yeah. He's a wanker now that mainstream media have been given the green light to say he is, after the public have said from day one. Politics.
Very eloquently put Mr Pie
I'm disappointed that you failed to mention that he organises journalists to be beaten up.
Boris and Trump, peas in a pod
I can't believe how bad Boris is on all fronts but what baffles me more, is the fact that he was voted in....
Jonathan pie for PM would be fucking incredible.
Can we please stop going on about the evidence and just trust a heartfelt Boris denial - what is wrong with you people?
You are a global treasure Jonathan.
He's Back!
A boiled sweet in a hoover bag,classic....
society is never cured of such people, merely in remission
His typical English person … lie and bully
But he's a good boy from Eaton…like the rest of them. 🤮
....................................Thank you Colin !!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCbxw8yWkGY
Dorries "Only the electorate have the right to remove an MP" Johnson chucked 31 of them out after they didn't back his ready meal Brexit deal. Where was she then? He's going to be writing for the Daily Heil. When I say 'writing' I mean creating more dog whistle rascist bullsh1t and bluster for people who think they are middle class because they read it when the actual middle class wouldn't touch that rag with a barge pole.
This is perfect
Who really gives two Fuchs about a very rich spoiled bully forget about him folks
Enough said
You are so right - a complete and compulsive liar.
He was a sad laughable circus clown long before he got into office and any mention of him since - be it good or bad - is a sort of 'salute to' or 'acknowledgments of'  a 'player'/character, which will of course make this worthless blonde orangutang smile. The most important issue should be the Establishment and how it continues to deflect attention from itself, 👺pissing itself laughing as the plebs are entertained by the jester.
The Pie is never wrong! 🔥
You either believe in facts & already saw through serial liar Boris.  OR you've been duped... But you're eyes are now open due to an overwhelming abundance of evidence.  OR you read the Daily Mail & you struggle to eat & breath at the same time & still delusionally praise him.
Thank you Jonathan!
Party gate is bad which ever side your on … if u saw people die in lock down working in care homes or hospitals it’s awful because the person ment to be protecting them was laughing at them… if you think it all was fake and lockdown was a con, it’s awful because he was locking people up for rules he created while laughing at them !   But I bet we’ve not seen that last of him or his ilk. Britain seems to be locked in a weird abusive relationship with these tw@ts and no one wants to sit us down and do an intervention !
I have been thinking about how to make politics boring and unattractive to the current crop of tossers who seem to keep poisoning the whole planet for the rest of the normal folk.  It's a very a boring plan to get us to a place where we can negate politicians completely.  We can remove the ideology, dogma, self serving, corruption and money from vested interests out of our politics - but it requires all of us to put in some hours. It's a bit like jury service. The mega rich and corporations would need to bribe everyone to get their will enacted rather than just a few tossers, like we currently have, so it would be much harder to do that. I think many people are too stupid to take back actual control if it means they might have to be involved. But I have thought of that too.  There's going to be a gcse-type in government course and you have to take it and pass it just to be in the raffle to be considered eligible. You'll be able to select sectors you are interested in or do nothing at all. All positions will be time limited and overseen by committee. You will not be allowed to do more than a specified number of government placements in your lifetime.  Voting will be done on a daily, weekly, monthly, annual and longer term basis for reaching consensus and be devolved by region, age-group and identity. Differing levels of political activity can therefore be sought and earned like clubcard points. Bigger issues will be debated regionally and nationally according to the freedoms of speech and behaviour as society selects them. Committees will underpin everything making for multiple pillars or government that each balance the powers. Remember no one stays on any committee for any amount of time sufficient that they can do any damage. Same with those on oversight. I said it would be boring.  A Civil Service will operate similar to how it is meant to now; to enable plans, ideas and policies to be put into effective practise without destroying the country which it always been generally quite good at, but again these roles will be rotated around everyone who has undergone training and passed specific exams. What school you attended will not form a part of the selection process, though civil servants will be educated to a higher level to make sure there is a longer term oversight creating stable government.  We will have no need for political parties but there's no need to abolish them. There funding will be administered from and audited by the government. Lobbying will be pointless. It will be very boring for many, but it will be democratic and it will be ours, for us by us unless you opt out of fail the citizenship tests and exams. At the moment any duffer can be a politician. And they do. And it shows.   I'm sure some of these ideas might spark better ones. I will have made some stupid suggestions. But man, we have to start somewhere.  So, if you're a political scientist, please develop and share this idea with someone cleverer than me to see where democracy can radically be enacted to get rid of these numpty, self-serving bastards once and for all.
get over it, Boris was the best prime minister this country has ever had
Your brilliant, we need people like you saying it like it is, keep up the videos 🖒
He flew to Afghanistan to avoid a vote on Heathrow's third runway.
Tell it! And no different to bp CEO, Bernard Looney. #bpPensions
Excellent as always
You have been dearly missed Mr Pie. Please, never leave us again like you did.
Come of the fence Jonathan. What do you REALLY think?
Nah, I think “lying cun@!” Although usually otherwise, is a great fit for this occasion.  And the litter he has spawned, maybe even worse. Dark times, bright minds are required🍀👍
Yes, you’re right about the lying not being news. Looks like lying is de facto these days.
So I guess you won't be going to Boris's new Book Signing then....Well said Mr Pie it's a bloody pity you don't stand for parliament, I for one would vote for you.
Now do the bad points of boris ´the kipper` blojob
We should now re vote on brexit.
Very good
What happened to Tim? 😂
This guy is up there with Saul Goodman at his brilliant best 😆
this politics thing is all a big headache isnt it??
Well spoken Jonathan.  Boris is a pathological liar i.e. someone who is totally incapable of speaking the truth and for that reason alone he should not be an MP!
Everyone knew what an abhorrent individual this man is. Yet he was voted in with a massive majority. You can fool some of the people some of the time. Although it looks like you can fool the bristish electorate all of the time because you constantly vote these massive 🔔 ends in. You'd think british people would learn after 15 years of thatcher, but no. Keep voting for people that look after their rich mates and leave the most vulnerable people in society deeply in the sh*t.
Superb
Being PM was just meant to be another jolly for Johnson with him taking all the accolades while Dominic Cummings did all the governing. The wheels came off the bus after the barnard castle drive and Johnson reverted back to type: lying, bullying and being ineffective under pressure.
Commenting for the algorithm
Yes, but what do you really think?
Show me a PM that isn't all these things!? 🤔
There appears to be spittle on the camera, dead center.
Boris is a lying c@@t ….. I punched the air at that bit 😂
Shame on the members of the electorate that voted in a narcissistic, psychopathic, lying charlatan. Shame on them all.
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag ! 🤣🤣🤣
Spot on. Shame on you if you voted for this prick. I certainly didn’t.
Jonathan Pie is not just an original comedy act but an important political voice in the national conversation. He expresses the rage, indignation and contempt that many people feel at the incompetence and duplicity of the Conservative government.
You finally, finally dropped the C bomb on him. Long overdue
Haha, we do have a disturbing habit of repeatedly voting for complete Thankyou Colins.
Ignorance of the rules is no excuse  Boris Johnson (whilst mayor of London talking about the congestion charge)
Anyone else watching Jonathan Pie to get their news?
And what's truly mindblowing is that Trump is worse! That takes some serious negativity.
Channelling my sentiments perfectly 😂👍🏻👍🏻
Imagine the Tories having integrity... at least if you compare them to the GOP...
Jonathan is the angel on my left shoulder and the devil on my right.
How do you get a political organisation put on to the terrorist list? Asking for a friend..
I can't take you seriously since Wear A Mask, I hate Brexit, and politicians on the whole, but at least he didn't want Masks like you!!!!
JONATHAN PIE …. You is da MAN 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well that aged poorly. Less than 24 hours later and it's already been announced that he's joining the ranks of well-paid columnists at the Daily Mail.
Boris and his antics has helped you pay for gas and electricity over the last few year! Given you  many opportunities to earn. 😮
You not just a treasure to your country, you're a treasure to the world Jonathan!!!! Keep up the great work calling things out as you see it 😁👏🙌
What are your thoughts on the worldwide excess deaths that the news channels aren't covering and the oncoming jump in MS thats about to happen.
"Foie-gras infused liquid shit" is such a wonderful descriptor. 😂  Please don't stop doing these segments; we all need them.
LIARS and bullies are nothing but COWARDS.  It’s there co-dependent “friends” who prop them up and tell them different.  They are ALL co-dependents for each other.  Knowing they’ll all  F-UP because all his cowardly, weakling friends will do the same.  Be careful of ANYONE who is friends with and/or loyal to Bozo Boris - because they likely are to be F-UPs as well … and that includes “King” Charlie!
As far as the media keeps giving him airtime he will keep being himself, simple!!!
Jonathan Pie nails it again.  Thanks.
There all liars
like the symbolism
Hes a narcissist, pathological liar and has zero empathy for anyone, a chronic fantasist, disloyal and ruthless. These are symptomatic of a psychopath. In a different life he'd be in prison, perhaps a killer. With his priveleged Etonian upbringing he instead followed the other path many psychopaths take: a machievellian bully who clambers to the top by ruining the lives of others.   And he was our Prime Minister.
He always wanted to be world King.  King Boris. ... F***King Boris.  Dubious Wrecks.
"Boiled sweet in a hoover bag" - classic Pie.
Why not rant how the entire media is memory holing the identity and motive of the Nottingham terrorist attacker. Yet we know every aspect about the victims lives. Why does this happen every time the victim is white in the UK?
Ugh! So cathartic.
Absolutely spot on, no one could have said it better, 100% spot on reporting
It's a shame that boris destroyed Britain's reputation as well...
When the pantomime of parody becomes the awful truth...
The venom in 2:26 and 3:16! I salute you Mr Pie
Problem is, the left get nowhere near the same scrutiny. Pie is just another champagne socialist.
I'm not into insulting boiled sweets in Hoover bags.
The Brexit thing wasn't really a lie because everyone with half a brain knew he was talking bull. Problem is  most people in this shithole don't which is why nothing ever changes
Absolutely bang on
It sounded like you were revving up to invent a brand new curse word at the end there. Times like these certainly merit a few!
Love this but I dont know if it's me but I have noticed that if you stare long enough at Jonathan in this video, he looks so much like boris! With the squinty face expressions haha still love your videos Jonathan keep em coming
Yikes, “the back of Boris” . . . that’s an image you can’t unsee.
And so say ALL of us 😂😂😂 keep it coming Pie we love it
I love that Pie is sporting a Boris Johnson hairdo in this one.
Bravo 👏
There are practical benefits to Brexit if only the re owner turds would actually stop getting in the way.
Shame Mr Pye has turned into just another raging leftist attack dog.
🥹👏👏👏👏
Jonathan Pie tells the truth 💖. 💯truth brilliant.
The man IS an offense
like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag.
As always, so eloquently put Johnathan :-D Also, i saw a very young you on heartbeat the other night, up to no good lol
"Boiled sweet in a hoover bag" ...the most accurate description yet of this mendacious buffoon.
“ looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag “ 😂😂😂😂😂 I just spat out my lunch
Accurate assessment of BJ, it’s a pity some of the media do not use this recording, instead of having the usual talking heads trying to justify what he did
Why are you getting upset? I would say I find your description of Boris as; if you had added the words," he holds the UK voters in utter contempt as lesser human beings", you would be describing the perfect Tory. I don't mind the swearing and it does make the description of Boris more potent, but sadly it prevents me from sharing your great videos on FB, which is what they deserve.
It's been too long! Glad Pie is back
Just tell him to leave the coccaine alone..pity you see the need to F everything in your presentation which comes across no better ...
99% of brits if given a platform to speak their mind, this is what they would say!!!!
a "fact averse startled pig in a haybale."Must make a note of that next time I feel like taking someone down with a compliment.
Hes a liar, definitely. May I remind us that he was sacked over the Chris Pincher affair by his own side. Awful leader, failed on Covid IMO. Yes, we got a version of Brexit but that was nothing more than seeing and exploiting the mess his predecessor left.
This feels good.
Brilliant. As one of the many who didn't get to say goodbye to a parent because we were "Doing our bit" for the country, you have articulated the true hatred I have for that complete narcissist.
3:16   That is all
Whatever happened to personal responsibility, accountability and accepting the consequences of one's actions?! AND DONT SHOOT THE MESSENGER!
Not short of Brilliant!
pig in a hay bale!  special!
Spot On
Couldn’t have said it better myself - I literally couldn’t !  Keep ‘em comin’! JCHK
BJ, a proven self serving, unwavering manipulator of the truth; how can this cretinous individual ever be trusted again to enter into British politics.  Moreover, those of his cronies (MP’s), who backed him during the ongoing ‘partygate’ debacle, thus ensuring they weaselled their way onto the PM’s honours list and who still back him now, in the knowledge that he has been found to be a liar.  How can these servile and sycophantic followers also every be trusted by their constituents?  One way to distanced themselves from the disgraced Prime Minister, is to hand-back their awards and titles etc. But we all know this will never happen.....The MP serving my area is a recipient of a honorary title, they have lost all credibility and can never be trusted again to honestly have their constituency as their main priority, instead of advancing their own career in the turbid and furtive world of politics.....best thing is not to vote for anyone involved in politics, as it only encourages them!
"A boiled sweet in a hoover bag..." Jonathan absolutely nails it. And l love the way he switches back into normal journalist mode at the end.
Gold. My rage at the right, at Murdoch, Trump, Morrison, Dutton, just boils. Entitled, self-serving pricks.
Why isn't this guy -or someone very similar-Prime Minister? And/or President? There is something Fundamentally wrong with global politics.  Maybe we should have to pass an intelligence  test  to earn the right to vote, who knows.
Murdoch still backing him
Very good, BUT! I like many others always knew who/what Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was..  What Really Pisses Me Off.. is that 13,966,454 members of the british public voted for the Lying #ToryScum Toff.!!..  #NeverForgetNeverFogive
Great to see you back.
Blobbajob Johnson is the sort of person you'd like to corner in a phone box so that you could jump up and down on them until the squealing stopped.
Lol said it before and I’ll say it again, Jonathan Pie says what we’re all thinking! 😂
Boris will return and i look forward to you crying out it  all over again
I would love this to be Johnson’s epitaph. We should stop giving him space on the media and then, hopefully he’ll be resigned to the oblivion that he richly deserves and detests so much. Thanks Mr Pie, never a better word spoken.
Whilst not a leftie I agree with you 100% on BJ
Thank you Johnathan. Every word the absolute truth and no one could have said it better.
YouTuber HG Tudor (who is himself a narcissist psychopath) has done a series on Boris. Boris is indeed an aware narcissist. His bumbling idiot persona is a facade and he has no empathy is manipulative and only does things for himself. It’s well worth a watch.
3:16
A brilliant display of anger! And so true, ALL OF IT. Sadly, no mention of the over 200K people he murdered by his incompetent handling of Covid-19. Or the £ Billions wasted in PPE purchases, no mention of Mone and her purchase of a £14 million yacht with proceeds of a donation, to her personal wealth, by the courtesy of a Tory government stealing from the public purse. No mention that he walked out on his second wife just after she had been diagnosed with cancer. Nor his habitual non-use of contraception and catching how many diseases to take home to his partners.
Epic, as always. Back when he was manouvering into position for PM by throwing the UK under a Brexit Bus, my Daily Mail reading parents asked me what I thought. I said I couldn't be more horrified that a lying, misogynistic, narcissistic fantacist could be even considered for anything other than failed journalist and jokular speech giver. It is scant comfort to be proved right.
Hallelujah!!
Oh I have been waiting a long time for this. I honestly think this is your best ever. I actually wet myself.
I get the strong feeling that there's about 30 more minutes of rant in there, bottled up and waiting to be unleashed.
Everyone is missing the only question worth asking ........................ How could this country have allowed anyone like Johnson to become PM? Johnson was not the cause of our problems but only a symptom. Everything else being said is is just hot air to fill the 24/7 news agenda! This might be the most serious question this nation has ever been faced with. Everyone in this country should be ashamed of what happened. And we should be very scared of the consequences of what Johnson was allowed to do. In struth the Fat Lady has not yet sung.
Utterly love it.  Thank you once again for so eruditely verbalising a Nation's feelings (those of us that aren't utterly morally corrupt or just plain stupid anyway).  Just Jacob Rees Mogg to tackle now...
The fact there are people who are so stupid they refuse to see the truth, is obscene. Makes you wonder what he would have to do, for them to see him for what he is....
Pie for Prime Minister!
How is he not in jail? His punishment is to no longer be an mp? That's the bare minimum I'd expect is for him to issue a public apology, be fined the amount he made as pm plus some more and finally sent to a dark room and not to return
He broke the rules he imposed on every one 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
A boiled sweet in a Hoover bag (or, as we'd say in Australia, a boiled lolly in a vacuum bag) 😂 Oh how I've missed your rants, Mr Pie 😂
"Looks like a boiled sweet in a Hoover bag". 😂 1:14
More Pie please, given the tragedy that is British politics JP should be a "daily staple" for the masses.😁👍
More kids for Boris until he has enough to start his own country
By simply existing Boris Johnson commits an offence.
Please ! Dont hold back ...lol
There is no morality, only entitlement. Why can’t us plebs just accept that.
Let's petition for Mr pie to take fishi sunaks job🤣
I'm glad Pie held back on his opinion here 🤣
Jonathan the word smith, saying what some of us are thinking. As for how people still support this guy? - Admitting you were wrong seems to be the most difficult thing in the world, these days, for someone (anyone) to do. Keep doing what you are doing Jonathan.
Just beautiful.
A boiled sweet in a hoover bag! 😂😂😂
Absolutely excellent. Jonathan Pie, of course.
Couldn't have put it any better myself
Sums up the man perfectly😊
Looks like a boiled sweet in a Hoover bag. 👏
I feel better now, I hope he does too.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day - JP
Why Bbc or ch4  havnt a " jon Stewart " type show with Pie is beyond me.
There is actually breathing, living people who both Back Boris & think he's somehow a victim.  The UK is a laughing stock thanks to him & Brexit
Don’t hold back just say it how it is 👏👏
Let’s not forget that when he was fucking behind said wife’s back, she was living with cancer.
My dearest hope is that johnson watches this.
It's really a shameful that people  believe in him. I just can't  understand why. Are people really so stupid. The media  brainwashing  of the masses  is truly pathetic, but it's working.  I don't understand why this is. Are we all so weak minded? I am all right, Jack mentally. There is a really high level of corruption in government that has been, for some time, they have lost billions  stolen  millions paid off their friends and cronies. Not one of them in jailed. There's no conscience to their crimes. The system is broken time for a radical change.
I always thought he should get a little bit of what Nikolai Ceuecesue got but on reflection that's to good for him and a waste of a  box of Atomic PB 82 it's rather ironic that he thought there was a vendetta coming from the guy who along with Darius Guppy conspired to have journalist Stuart Collier beaten because he exposed the pair of rats
''Divided Tories prepare for free vote on Boris Johnson Partygate report''  still cant make their minds up, no wonder country in such a mess.
Yet still tory David TC Davies refused to be drawn out on question time that Boris should have gone long ago
The United States need a Jonathan Pie.
Respect to Pie for still being able to get angry, he's a way more optimistic figure than I can manage to portray...
Love it!!
He made up every source he ever had at the Times. I know people who worked there when he was fired. After being caught lying they checked the older sources which were all fake too. Pathological.
I love the fact that this (quite frankly awesome satire) is better and more informative than most of the news we see on the main steam media.
This is the result of an education at Eaton
Well said.
I laughed so hard at the 'a boiled sweet in a hoover bag' line.
Can we use your words to slam Joe Biden? 🗯
For once, Jonathan Pie tells us how he really feels.
looks like a 'boiled sweet in a hoover bag'.....probably the most complementary thing ever said about him
There all liyers it's mp first law
Talk about evisceration..........................love it.
Love the sentiment of the video but please stop referring to him as 'Boris' . He's got a surname like the rest of us so please use it. Does my fucking head in.
It's great to see you back, Mr. Pie...  hopefully on a regular basis 🤗  PLEASE give us your commentary - as only you can do - on the #kremlingremlin's useful idiot,  the  #DiaperDon, and his treasonous stolen documents BS and court crap...  Please don't hold back on your cussing, either 👍👍👍 😂😂😂 💕💕💕  Thanks in advance... tee hee 🇨🇦
He gets it so right! The biggest bull shitter in the ring of bull shitters in the houses of parliarment! that is Boris. Love Jonathan pie.
"A boiled sweet in a Hoover bag". Priceless! Only Carrie could suck on that!
Boris is like that unflushable turd clinging on for dear life
Aww that was brilliant I’m laughing my head off😂😂
Guto Hari was on Newsnight last night obfuscating Boris's misdeeds, rubbishing the committee and justifying his whining. What an arsehole
Yes demonstrably an authentic LFC.
Lol. True, every word.
Oh, I have missed your gentle, polite analysis, Mr pie
They’re all the same. Lying money grabbers spending tax payers money on cronies.
Foie gras?!
Yep, every word is true BUT... there are STILL people out there who think he's great, would like to see him back - and that he should never have gone in the first place - and they warm to his 'personality'. There was a voxpop interview the other day in Uxbridge when some piss-stained old tosser said he liked him because he was  - wait for it - quirky. Quirky? FFS. I'll retire to bedlam.
Well done again!
Weird how so much of this could be said about Donald Trump as well.
I get the impression that you’re not keen on him ?
A perfect summation of the coward.
Just substitute Trump for Boris
Love me some pie 😂
Who cares
Possibly my favourite video ever
😮
"has done nothing but spray his foie gras infused liquid shit all over our constitution!" Brilliant commentary as always, Mr Pie!
'Boiled sweet in a Hoover bag'.  Brilliant, Mr Pie.
He's just a smaller Trump.
Perfectly summed up.
Summed up quite nicely…. LIAR and BULLY…..  And for those who voted for him……..and still believe he has been treated badly……WAKE UP…..it’s TRUMP all over again….
"...like a wounded balloon..." Gold!
Poundland Trump as someone so eloquently and accurately described him.
Running off like a wounded balloon 😂😂😂
It was never about lying, because he simply never believed the rules applied to him.  He thought he could say and do anything and it would be fine and for far too long his self belief was proved correct.
More pie please!    Barb
Spot on. So funny that all the voters with delusions of grandeur  who pretended Brexit wasn't about narrow minded xenophobia and racism but really about sovereignty, are now complaining about parliamentary sovereignty and calling it a kangaroo court and a witch hunt.
Johnson turned the British people into trumptards 😅😅😅😅
I would love to quickly remove a chair as he was about to sit on it. I’d just be so content.
All this and more. Well said.
I imagine that will be played as his eulogy…or perhaps I fantasise
Brilliant and spot on 👍
Good point but why swear, why??? Dont need to. Your english is lacking!😢
We need to movement along the lines of #metoo like #shaftedbyboristoo ?
Get ‘em!
Boris was bad, just wait until kier starma gets in
It’s not only that gross pig  why on earth haven’t we eliminated this system where we quite openly know politicians lie consistently  Waste our money     continuously promote there pals  when caught failing in one dept to  run another usually with a huge pay rise  And using the police during Covid to act like thugs enforcing the rules that don’t apply to themselves TBH  It’s Shameful  and ridiculous   I want no part in voting  WHY.  there mostly liars thugs and thieves  plus a few pedeos hiding within  I sure as hell not gonna play but its fun watching the  sham but not on mainstream media
Its like saying the back of the BBC. Someone sold his soul i see.
"his foi gras infused liquid s**t" has just had me spit my Weetabix all over my computer! Brilliant!
And they would still vote for him!!!???
Your Boris sounds like (and resembles) the former guy in the US. Your descriptions are spot on.
just imagine, the millionaire bully from eton is mascarading as the victim and people fall for it. he and his friends should never again  be allowed to hold any office in this country he deserved to be condemned and he deserves even more… just imagine if an ordinary person would lie and break the law that much… we would be in front of a court… but this privileged mofo just allowed to continue to play the brainless bully he is… and he gets away with it
It's absolutely wild how people like Johnson and trump came to power almost simultaneously.
He's Harry Flashman writ small and stupid.
If only were on politics live yesterday, was like a Boris helpline with one vaguely sane person. It's staggering to think people will still listen to him.
And to think, He will still get his golden pension because he was PM.
God, these videos are such a stress reliease....
Tell me how you really feel Jonathan...lol
You speak for most of us, Jonathan. Thank you for getting it off of my chest.
BJ has lied his entire life, and he always got away with it!!!! Looking back is amazing how he lied and the people swallow his lies. This pig need to be ban from politics.
Couldn't have explained it better myself.... The worrying fact is.... There are still millions of people out there that think this TOTAL LYING BULLYING C**T should still be in Politics and unbelievably... running the country.
Brilliant Brilliant 🤩  If we could all watch this on the BBC news tonight’ the whole country would know then , what a lier this turd IS ‘  Or maybe in the Daily Mail 😂  or maybe that’s stretching it a bit too far.
First the NYT and now the BBC, Pie u r a sellout!
Come back Boris and smash the lefties
Yes Jonathan, but he ( will) still get(s) away with it by playing the loveable rogue card with the public.
Spot on again, as always. The thing that grates with me is that the Queen had to sit alone at the funeral of her husband, and this liar was at a party. But he's independently wealthy and born with a silver spoon in his mouth, so he doesn'tgive a shit about anyone or anything. Bottom line, Boris only cares about Boris.
Classic!
I would just love to hear your opinion on Morrison here in Australia.
Verbal diarrhea squared
I’m glad he is gone 😩
A lying narcissist.
Yes he broke the rules   just like 100 % of the rest of us
You forgot to mention this loser led the UK into the disastrous ultimate retreat from Afghanistan in 2021
Oh boy, we really need that...
Not defending bojo, though people forget liebour sent us to war on a lie.
What aren’t you coming to the US, JP? We need you!!!
Jonathon Pie for Prime minister
Boris or Trump - who came first, and who is the bigger lying sack of shit? Real answers only please.
Jonathan, you are the voice of the nation, well, the decent part of it, that is. Not the entitled, privileged, narcissistic, deluded individuals who still think Boris and his cronies have EVER has any interest in doing anything remotely good for the country that doesn’t benefit themselves financially. Hmmm, now you’ve god me ranting, thanks. 😂
Boiled sweet in a Hoover bag. I wish I’d coined that!
You really like him don’t you lol 😂
OMG… “boiled sweet in a hoover bag” and “pig in a hay bale” 😂🙈
He majored in entitled bullying.  His popularity isn’t something the average Brit should be proud of because they ‘made’ him in his full corrupt glory.
@ 2:39
System is broken
So good to have you and your brutally honest vitriol back!
Pie nails it as always
He speaks very highly of you though..............................LOL
I love Boris he makes me laugh
uk doesnt have a constitution does it?
Bring back ‘Tim’…
Hi Tom from across the pond!
Fg infused!
He is a “fu***** lying cu**”…. LOL 😂 😂😂😂
Johnson is delusional not a liar! I never voted for the man-child spoiling my ballet as none were fit & all who voted for Boris bought Boris Johnson's delusional ramblings. Boris larped as Churchill not really knowing a fvcking thing & you clapped him along as your just as ridiculous! Politicians are a reflection of society & my how Britain has become filled weighted anchors!
He raises his blood pressure so I don't have to 😂😂. Nice one
Where can I get that T-shirt❓
Hold on… as far as I know Britain does not have the constitution which is the essence of this make it up as you go sh…show 2:00
He's an ejaculate of an excuse for a human.
'Bulla Bulla Bullsh*t'
Carrie On Up The Johnson.
Is there a nexus?  A mystery plot surrounds Nadine Dorrie’s denial to a seat in the House of Lords, a mystery plot described yesterday by Piers Morgan.  Then there is the simultaneously occurring mystery in the U.S.A.  A run for the White House.   ‘Neglected boxes upon an empty stage,’ at Mar-a-Lago .  The U.S. National Archivist Colleen Shogan, a mystery writer herself, demanding documents protected by a Presidential Records Act.  All these shenanigans can not help but to raise a curious eyebrow.😂😂😂
::shudders:: ::breathes deeply:: ::lights a cigarette:: Fuck that was good.
Bravo! All hail the algorithm 🎉
I'd call this "harsh but fair", but to be perfectly honest with myself, it's not harsh, either.  Truth is truth.
Fantastic video as always!
Putting it in a nutshell as always.
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag? What sort of meaningless, shit, unfunny joke is that? This is the kind of 'humour' that gets claps, not laughs.
Welcome back, Mr Pie! We’ve missed your eloquence and humor! Thank you very much!😊
A spat out boiled sweet in a Hoover bag , GOODRIDDANCE to blow jo
It feels so good doesn't it, when Jonathan lets it all out, all the truth and no bullshit, expressing our own anger 😁🤗😘
One day children will watch these videos to understand what was the mood "at the time" because nothing else captures it better.
Bravo Mr Pie. Honest, open invective at is very best. I feel more at ease after every one of your videos. Keep up the good fight mate. Best wishes from New Zealand, where Christopher Luxon is the nearest we have to privileged, wealthy, virtue signalling Tories. He's a COCK too. Go well fair Warrior.
Boris Johnson makes me glad that I live in China.
Bang on!  As always!
Poetically if Boris had just been upfront honest from the start and said he partied during lockdown his followers and party would have likely just gone "LOL thas Wild Bobbly Boris for ya 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧"
Little ott JP but classic 😊
Brexiteers: I think Boris may have lied
the working class Tory men still love him.
he thinks we are all morons.
Now every time I see Bozo's fat, ugly, gurning mush, which, let's hope, will be few and far between, I will only see a boiled sweet in a Hoover bag! Fantastic coping mechanism that Mr Pie, thanks muchly!
God he is British version of trump
Boris was just hounded out of office. It's a total witch hunt. He had done nothing wrong yet the woke media like Jonathan Pie just don't like him. So they crucify him. He is like Jesus and will rise again.
Love the Yes Minister reference sneaked in there
Hmmm, Boris...........I think Jonathan doesn't like you, just like the rest of the country, thank God Jonathan has the platform to speak for us, thank you Jonathan
Boris and Trump are two of a kind.  Thanks so much Rupert Murdoch for influencing millions to vote for these two turds.
genuinely cathartic. full on ŌM !!!
I'd pay good money to see this guy and Trae Crowder (the Redneck Liberal) in the same room. 😆
Hey, Pie, fix your hair, you're starting to look like Boris!
10/10
Say how you really feel Jonathan
Been waiting patiently for this video!
Obviously particularly bad loser pro EU traitors disingenously think if they all tell a lie at once it'll become "truth".
😂 just say what you mean JP!! ❤
Wait, are we talking about Johnson or Trump?
You're a genius!
Well said my mush
So cathartic! Go Jonathan.  I have a newish grandiose nacissistic neighbour, similar to Johnson. They are straight  out of the textbook.  If I had not seen this type of pathology in action I would not have believed it. They cause enormous damage to anything in their vacinity.  Ps. I hope you keep yourself super healthy and well, Jonathan.
Thank you for allowing me to think I'm not the only one who is thinking this.
Spaz
Your hair style is becoming very "Boris". Be careful it doesn't start turning white/blonde
What you've said is way too complimentary and driven by logic, I wouldn't be allowed to say what I think about this Man as it might be construed as abusive.and result in a hate crime? He's a clown a bafoone a dancing monkey, with a guinea pig living on the top of his head sucking the vitamins and minerals out of his brain. If anyone Bears some guilt for what's happening in Ukrain and all those dead  it's Boris who sabotaged those peace talks in Istanbul 22, but that won't bother home a bit, he'll sleep well tonight  like a baby because its not his problem, I'm game on bring out the  pig's head my good fellow's, and a fine buxum wench to ravish over a table?  let's all stop quarrelling and do what I say, hurrah for Britain, hurrah for Eton, hurrah for me, everyone wave a union jack and say I'm Churchill. What a fraud this clown is..
Sooooo unfair to pigs …
Pie, nailing it
The country is bankrupt for Boris to actually become PM and remember lettuce head
Go Pie ❤
Magnificent,  you've made my Friday.
Boris can’t handle the truth. Clap emoji!
Yet again, a perfect summation of the character of this abhorrent being! Excellent and many thanks!
I just want somebody to tie the slippery-pig-in-chief-and-thats-being-totally-unfair-to-pigs down to a chair and make him get roasted by Pie for minimum of a decade.
"Looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag" ........................... is my new favourite.
Spot on again.
I am laughing, But it is a new thing to be laughing about the actual truth. Pie in politics. keep on telling you. '''i'd vote for you:)
Amen...can we all remember tnis please, for the next time this bullingdon bastard smirks his way back...
Chad Boris makes virgin Jonathan cry and seethe  😎😎😎  M
Thank you so much. These videos stop me from going on similar, less succinct rants and giving myself a brain aneurysm
... good runner though.
Yet in Ukraine Boris is a national hero.  Best put him in a Challenger Tank and ship him out as Tank with driver.
"Pig in a hay bale." 🤣🤣🤣
"boiled sweet in a hoover bag" - I sprayed my drink at that. Please dont ever stop making these videos! Thankyou for existing! P.S.  I would really really really love to see what happened if you actually ran in an election.  There are a few by elections coming up.  Now's your chance!
THANK YOU!!! Amazing
Change a few relatively minor details and this rant works equally well for Donald Trump.
BBC still trying to do “balance”, and elevating the voices of the few maniacs who follow the selfish twat as if those opinions hold equal weight with the evidenced details of the report against him or the majority who’ve had enough.
Oi,,where have you been??
Would that excuse have worked for people who were charged during lockdowns, trying to see their dying relatives?
Bloody hell Colin, you could have chosen a better time to butt in! JP was just getting started!!!!
Exact and exactly how I feel.
Feck I’ve had a busy day, it’s fecking late and now I’m stuck getting my adrenaline all raised up again! 😂. We love you Johnathan.
If I didn’t know any better I’d think Jonathon was talking about Donald J. Trump, but then there’s no one on this side of the Atlantic who’s smart enough to call him out. We need our Pie!! 😵‍💫
Fucking hell that was exquisite.
would love to see you reading the 6 o clock news on the bbc
Don't hold back! Tell us what you really think!!😂😂😂
I knew I would be seeing this video soon.
You should upload videos more often Jonathan.... Pleeeeease!!!
My dream is to have jp or Tom appear on question time and actually project the pure venom in these videos at a real mp, can you imagine the answer dodging fuckers trying to evade the tyrade of delicious fact based bullets the would rain upon them, because we all know, he is right every single time, Tom you make the monotonous subject of politics something I actual like listening too just because I say to myself "oh no jp is going to ruin you"
Thank-you Jonathan… thank-you. Couldn’t have put it better myself.
I think you should get off the fence Jonathan, I'm not sure where you stand.
My word. Too good my friend, too good
I noticed the 666 hand sign in the thumbnail.
Brilliant !!
Boiled sweet in a Hoover bag! 😂
I don't understand how we keep on getting complete bucket's of shit running out country i just don't understand 😡
JP drops a well deserved C-bomb - can’t think of anyone more fitting to bestow that one on! Still can’t beat the ‘looks like a cross between a head injury and an unmade bed’. Genius!  The sad and unfathomable fact, to me at least, is - like Trump, so many voters still love him?! Sadly it says more about the public at large than one highly deceitful and self serving individual .
Boris Johnson has secrets about his body shape.
👏👏👏👌👌👌💪💪💪👍👍👍
Mr Pie you ought to be delivering these talks in parliament. Please run for office. The entire lot of them would shit their pants.
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag!  Best yet 😆
but the hair!
good god you love the sound of your own voice.
Would love to see Jonathan Pie demolish Rees Mogg...how are his morals when he defends and supports a proven liar and adulterer?
POLITICIANS ARE DECEIVING AND BEING DECEIVED.  THE NEXT PLANNED ENSLAVEMENT IS COMING SOON
he lied to disgrace the UK. No fxxking country will listen to the UK anymore.
Loving the BBC Radio podcast. Why did the ' caller'from Fingringhoe sound Bristolian? Theyre all Laaaaandoners out here.
i like this guy’s comment!
Boris looks like an amateur compared to Donnie Trump...but they deserve one another - wish they could be cellmates.
"The only people who can get rid of him are his constituents!" Hmmm... How has that gone in years past?
Aw britain. Am tryna still care i am honest.. but when your led by liars and thiefs its hard not to become what they are if your not careful.   Theirs so much truth to that staement. Sorry tesco.. your brexit prices are mental. "Put it in the bag helen, they wont know"..  You'v NO IDEA how much people steal from mayjor retailers on camera or not... people just dnt fkn care guys, even mothers with new borns come in and just raid the place.. old woman grabs 30 sirloin steaks, trys to walk out.. "security".. one may shout..maybe try stop them.. 2 men (massive lads) with blades walk next to the guards.. guards stop..do nothing.. woman walks free lol..  Americans might say.. "only if u had a gun".. i find that statement hilarious.. "nowon dies in britain if u steal steaks" i always think.. a small win i say lol.... stock can be replaced.. not people u trigger happy twats lol.. but still we have a problem in britain.. ofcourse not solved by guns but by fair, affordable trade.  Its a shame greed is what makes working class fight eachother rather than what should be.fought  Srry, complete rant. Am ticked off just like the rest of u.. comedians make more sense and journos.
The known liar, Boris Johnson, has found out to be a, errrr, liar. Mr Pie, you are, as you so often are, right on point.
Boris Johnson was just a more articulate version of Trump. Good riddance to both of them.
All of them democrats are like this, otherwise they are regarded as nazis  aren't they.
I concur......
The only logical conclusion: The majority of voters are masochists and/or secretly hate themselves but aren't smart enough to realize it.
Shocking yet utterly appropriate use of the c-word, I feel.
I wish you all the Best JP and am grateful for all the great insights and entertainment you've produced for YT.  IMO going to the BBC is a huge gamble, it really puts you on the spot to maintain your cutting criticism on your now employers as BBC is in most peoples opinion, a direct branch of the Tory Political Elite. I hope we dont get a coopted and watered down JP in the new show. Just my Two Cents, you deserve every success and Im rooting for it being a great show.
Absolute truth!
Word.
Glad to see you back in action
That "lying effing C" was so unbelievably satisfying
took his current wife out on a date when he heard his then wife was having treatment for cancer. Thought it was leftwing lies until i researched it. Unbelievable
I hope he’s remembered as “disgraced prime minister” before his name
boiled sweet in a hoover bag... spot on
Any chance this video could be projected onto the front of Johnson's house and put on repeat?
"He looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag"  Christ, I'm going to have to remember that one!
Who could have predicted that the man who was fired from numerous jobs for lying would continue to lie as a PM? No one could have predicted that, not a single person (!)
Said it before, I'll say it again, STAND FOR MP somewhere
He even lied to Nadine
i love the 480i quality
Is that all ? Here in America former president sharing nuclear strategies and war plans with kid rock and golf buddies ......and there are taped conversations . .....Britain do better 😂
I thought Pie was being quite restrained...
So what does this say about us - the electorate? As Pie say,  We knew he was a liar way back but chose to be taken in by his scruffy charm. We totally deserve what we got and should share the blame for all the impact of Boris's wrong doings to our country. Will WE learn from our mistakes? I somehow doubt it
Duuuuude!!!! The labour files!!! I mean this one was great as ever but……….The Labour Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiles!!! Please.
Perfect summarisation in 3min 45 what else is there to say?
Total Rubbish Remoaners   but yes about Sue Gray and HH
“Wounded balloon” 😂
good slice
Aha, at last we stir the sleeping dog that is Pie. Thank you, I shall enjoy this when I'm allowed the sound on.. Cheers Tom
They partied away confidently, as they obviously knew there was very little risk to their own health.  The fear they imposed will impact this country for generations…with many lives ruined and lost along the way.
It is  wise to remember that unless he is formally banned he could come back. If he was given a safe Tory seat & won he'd be back in the commons if only to stir trouble & seek revenge. The Tories could be re elected too at the next election, its possible even now.  The electoral system as it stands works in their favour. Well past  time  for reform in Britain. Neither of the two main parties will  initiate this so it very much up to the public to apply the pressure.
Good to see and hear ya back Mr Pie!, lol :D
Excellent.
“A lying fucking cunt” - which is being polite and underplaying the truth!
'A Boiled Sweet in a Hoover Bag' - a fitting epithet for  Great Britain's version of Donald Trump!!
Brits loved his lies and angrily demnded more lies. As long as they can wave their silly little flag. They wanted to ruin the EU because of ignorance and arrogance, I will never forgive the Brits for that and hope that the UK will soon fall apart.
Nice use of the C word, very appropriate in this case. I’ve been muttering it all evening .
He lied, the Tories knew he lied, the public knew he lied., Boris himself knew everyone knew he was lieing..... And no one did jack shit about it.
All politicians are complete and utter liars.  Boris' ultimate crime was that he was one of the few who were inept enough to be caught with his lovable, clownish trousers hanging around his hairy kankles once too often.
"You are guilty ! Now how do you plead" ? Yes , Harriet , they are too stupid to realise what you have just done and the whole unedifying coup process . Just read some of these comments . Beyond help .
Now you're talking!
Boy I love your Tshirt Where can I get one?
Even my headphones disconnected 30 seconds into his rant.... I could sense that although BOJO is gone Jonathan is even angrier....
Brilliant
Awesome
Next time, don’t hold back….
Yeah you lot all slag him off yet someone's voting for the Tories one way or the other. Why not stop moaning about the blonde haired over sized twat and vote them OUT!?!
Brilliant comedy. You couldn't do this kind of stuff now 'cos you'd get cancelled by wokeness.
He as to be one of the biggest tossers going if not the biggest
The front of Johnson is bad enough ...  But I am glad to see the back of him. Better would be to not see him or any of the other Tory Robber Barons again. Throw in Nigel Frottage for good measure (the original importer of American politics by lies)  Another epic excoriation by Jonathan. View this with James O'Brien's takedown.
Discerning use of the C word btw works so well 👏
Brilliant and true Johnson is a c t
Never mind this bullshit, we know he’s a liar.  Instead let’s focus our ire upon the 220000 people who needlessly died as a result of Johnson’s negligence in the handling of the Covid-19 crisis.
Why on earth don't one of 4's family of channels give this man a series? Satire at it's most scathing. No punches pulled, and every blow lands
of course nobody mentions his greenlighting of hs2. a crime infinitely worse than this of zero importance to anything distraction
Mr Pie that was an eloquent and absolutely perfect obituary for a waste of oxygen. Thank you.
Johnson couldn't find enough people in his own party to keep him in power. Some of these people have known him since school and were actually his own siblings. For some reason, his supporters think they know him better.
Yes Jonathan but how do you really feel about him :)
100% bang on & what anyone with a working brain thinks about the corrupt lying clown.
I salute you pie.
And yet, remind me because there is not a single man in Britain who will admit to voting for him during 2019   Or if there is, s/he is keeping very quiet about it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Jonathan!!!
That exact statement should be read in the commons
Foie gras infused liquid shit 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’ve been waiting for this!  Never fails…priceless
Boris is a puppet   of course he is news. U are talking about HIM instead of puppet masters...
There doubts about him from the start. Very serious doubts. Yet.  Where are the leaders?
💯
At 2-40 rumor   has it that was Boris on the road hog entrance right of the screen , gas lighting Jonathan whilst getting pizza for the party )
How far back do you have to go to find someone this deceitful and morally bankrupt who was Prime Minister of the UK?
"...Thank you Colin"  That is pure genius!
Lol, I couldn't have put it better myself 😅😅😅😅
You can tell when Boris is lying. He has a tell - breathing.
I fucking adore you. Don’t stop.
That was a pretty good description. I'm surprised he didn't exaggerate a little.
Ne'er a truer word said! And so eloquently, love it!
love your work
Boiled sweet in a Hoover bag 🤣🤣🤣 perfect
What a piss poor recent run of terrible pm,s we,ve had to suffer. Almost makes Biden seem Americas most credible.
The amount of people supporting him with: 'the rules were too complicated, it's not his fault!'.... They were his rules!
What are you saying?   (Like your style sir).
I’ve watched it three times, but I can’t really seem to make out if Pie is for or againt Boris. The video is so subtle. Vague, even.
I clicked like before the video even started to roll because I knew it was going to eviserate him.
Maybe he thinks he is like an under cover police man. "Its not a crime because I'm a witness."
New cockney rhyming slang. Boris Johnsense.
Thank you!
I'd love to make the waffling bovine talker to watch this 😆
Now I can sleep easy.
LFC!!!
He is Boris Trump!
Hooray for Pie! Consistently calling BS on Boris's BS all these years 🎉🎉🎉
Brilliant as ever and great to meet you last night in Leicester Sq at 'The Eastern Front' Premier. PS, I am signed up to your podcasts :)
We need Jonathan Pie to save Canada from Pierre Poilievre, Doug Ford, Danielle Smith any the other lying conservatives
I watched this several times because it was so enjoyable
26+6=1
When’s he going to prison?
Fuck, i'd like to shake Pies hand, what a champ.
Worth the wait ...
Now talk about Sunak.
I think the youtube block my last response... so id just like to say Jonathan Pie your brilliant, keep up the good work i imagine you as James O'Briens inner voice ❤
Jesus Christ Jonathan, please get off the fence and tell us what you really think about Johnson.   I found this quite therapeutic, actually.
" 'ware teg i Jonathan Pie - gwirionedd pob gair,  twll tin Boris"
I hate all this bullshit about Boris. We're better off ignoring him now and focussing on Rishi aren't we?
Kant
Quote "Boiled lolly in a hover bag"... what's been seen can not be unseen.
I just love you man 😂
I think Pie is being a little kind be to Johnson to be fair.
brilliant rant totally agree
Thank you 😊 The men in suits who put him in are still there working for the conservatives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27OKLyGGxKw
Foi gras liquid shit pretty much sums up Bojo
Foie gras infused liquid shit!! What a line!!😂 also a boiled sweet out of a hoover bag! 😂 please though Jonathan, think twice before using mysogonistic slurs. You should know better. Basics: balls vs pussy, the c word... 3:45
Johnson will not write history you will, you sir are a Legend.
Love this channel - even watching from Germany its so teaching what's happening in the UK, amazing that a Mini-Trump could be the PM, mind-blowing!
100% 👍
Pie is a hero
Thank you for expressing my feelings better than I can!
Not loving the sexiest comments but otherwise you are a totally awesome dude! Cheers Jonathan!
He has failed upwards his whole career me thinks.
Greetings from Australia, must say couldn’t have put it better!!! Now get on to honours list! What a pisstake that is!!
I have a little inkling that Tom enjoyed doing this particular video.. ! Sure was satsifying to watch.
Welcome back, sweet prince 🤴
His hair is paying tribute to Boris 😂
Listening to Jonathan rant is genuinely cathartic. He is so able to express how i feel so incredibly well…⭐️ Never stop, Jonathan 👊
Absolutely fantastic 🎉
Get off the fence Johnno
I had to shake his hand once while he was on his fairwell tour. Obviously I (literally) washed my hands the second I could afterwards.   I think he knew that everyone there knew what he was and that his jovial bullshit and his incoherent stammering was only going to lower our opinions of him. Honestly he looked like a tired and pathetic ancient ball sack and he knew that's what we saw.  It was kind of funny.   Oh his handshake was weird too, not quite two fingered but more off centred and he obviously introduced himself "boris johnson, prime minister" to every person in the room. I think the weird handshake was to try and get people off balance or something but it just came across as stinking of mental weakness.  Literally the only thing he has going for him is that he went Eton, that's it. Even his uni course was a joke, "the classics" I think you mean ancient media studies mate.
Awesome 🎉🎉🎉
He's like therapy
Inundated! I'm a rather simple man, accustomed to polite conversation...   Yet this Tsunami of insightful eloquence had me cheering from the bleachers!  GO GO GO Lord Jonathan! If we had only someone of Your Courage on the other side of the Pond whom was honestly evaluating their Blond & Brainless supposed "Leader" (???)....    I'll be sending You the medical bill 4 Broken Ribs- NO! This rib tickling pain was well worth the agony....   Some believe that the search for TRUTH can end up as a Masochistic endeavour, laughingly- I now deem that as a possibility. I shall tear up the bill, am considering a Donation. So, in retrospect, I'm about to burst into song;   🎼🎵🎶🎵🎶🎶 ALWAYS LOOK ON THE PIE SIDE OF LIFE   😎🥧👍
Hey! Leave fois gras out of this. It's never told a lie.
Britains Trump
To quote a certain MTV show...  Johnson is a "Grade A, Solid State, High Definition Turd."
Why is it that Johnson lied to the Queen seems so heinous to me! And BTW calling Johnson a cunt is just flattering him. Just love Pie :-)
Morrison in Australia, Trump in  America and Johnson in the UK. All 3 avowed conservatives, all 3 known for being untrustworthy/liars, all 3 managed covid in a similarly discombobulated, probably corrupt way, with lots of money given to their backers.   All moaning and blubbering about how they’ve been wronged. Pitiful bunch of sooks and girls blouses.
Many thanks from my wife, JP. I was all set for a moan at her about BJ but watching 3m45s of you has taken the wind right out of my sales!
So refreshing that no bleeps were used when truth is told 😂
Priceless!
Sigh…. Wonderful !
''he looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag'' .... i don't know what that means but it sounds damming🤣
King Charles.. Part of it.
"A boiled sweet in a hoover bag" - genius :D
Speaks the truth 😊
"Boiled sweet in a hoover bag..." One of your BEST, sir! 😂  M 🦘🏏😎
Yep, I'll go for that, thick as Sh^^t, a Fu***ing liar and very self centred. (Didn't have to star that out!.) He repulses me, a self - centred individual that has been  openly encouraged by the Tory party to do his worst. Abominable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GQ4UANm4k In 2009 Mr Johnson said this while interviewed on HARDTalk and while serving as Mayor of London.   Mr Pie referred to it in 2020 when talking about the Government's refusal to fund free school meals during the pandemic and the efforts by Marcus Rushford and others to keep schoolchildren fed during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.
At least David Cameron had the decency to piss off over the green hill and far away after stepping down. Boris Johnson left the office of Prime Minister ALMOST A YEAR AGO, and yet he's STILL front and bloody centre. It's excruciating.
There all liars they all knew he was not telling the truth and stuck up for him. Rishi included
03:15 is the most accurate quote I have ever heard
Hats off sir X❤
The only man that I would ever vote for
Keep it up Mr Pie!   You're right. Mr Johnson should be finished in public life. He's been given the benefit of the doubt since 1987. Long enough. Good riddance and keep him out.
Whats with the 666 handsigns?
Boris didn't lie about Brexit (not completely) everything else, yes.
Brilliant!
Lord this schtick has gotten old, One trick pony Pie
If only he'd gone to Durham,  then in an almost Biden like conversion of reality, there would be nothing to see here.  Looking forward to seeing Tom's amusing skit on the Somalian rapist, and the amusing double murder high jinks in Nottingham, (surely something to do with the Sheriff in that one?), going to be rib tickling, haven't laughed so much since the Manchester bombing, missed that skit, there we go.
Brilliant sir absolutely brilliant
apart from all that, what’s wrong with Boris?
I wish...I wish...I wish...that Blowjob and his many cronies are placed in Jail and tethered by their fat necks to the floor...on their knees for years in recompense for their murderous lies and theft....I hate these ne'er do wells...grrrrrr
You sort of nailed there, I might have added the word greedy in there too.
I ❤ Pie
😂 I love how worked up you get, because Im just like that myself, so to see you at it, is like looking in the mirror whilst letting loose. I especially love the colourful descriptions you use, and that is also definitely one of my trademarks when I get riled up. I usually eat spoon after spoon of the crud that life throws at me, with a patience that I never knew I had, but eventually there comes that unseen point of no return when I suddenly burst into an apocalyptic ragefit in which I have been known to create new swear words since my mind is trying to utter a Bakers dozen of them simultaneously. In other words, watching you tear into delinquents such as the "albino Kumquat Jack in the Box Johnson", is a delight for both eyes and ears. Do keep up your hatred for uncontrolled indecency.  Lots of laughs from Germany 😉
Nailed by Pie. Oh happy days
this was probably the most enjoyable 3.45 minutes i've ever had
You forgot that he looks like a womble in a bad suit...
you're the best out here JP...rave on
Yes, but he hid it well 😂
There was a time when tar and feathers were the appropriate attributes.  Oh dear, those were the days...
So quick to get out the pitchforks and torches....ranting and raving like a child.
“A lying fucking cunt”.  Chefs kiss 🤌🏼
We need you in the USA
Description of Johnson sounds like a description of Trump, except Trump won’t quit/jump
"a wounded balloon" :-)
fok ye
Pie never disappoints
you don't have a constitution
"But he's got a personality." cry some of the most thick-headed in our society.
Yep, theyre ashamed to admit that they were wrong and fooled by a fraud, so instead invent an alternative narrative to support their belief:  Andrew Cuomo was saying the same of Trump supporters earlier today on “The Newsagents”, same applies for Boris.
Shame you are on the BBC payroll.
Bojo is as daft as his hair cut.
Fantastic. Loving the podcast series on Radio 4 btw. Only discovered it the other day.
Thanks. I needed that.
Perfect timing and execution. Again
❤
Brilliant just brilliant as always, now wheres the personal cost and accountability for the odious, Entitled, Elitist, Corrupt, Compromised, Bumbling, Incompetent, Pathological lying, Morally bankrupt, Serial Shagging Boris Johnson!!??!! His honours must be refused! 🤔🙄🖕🍋💨💩👎👎👎👎😬😂🤣😂😁💚💚💚🌍.
Oh but I really didn’t mean to be a filthy Eton educated lying charlatan! it how I was raised to be? I promise it will not happen again, I know I have said this before but I mean it this time, and a I am a sociopath and a liar?
"Looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag". My god,  I cant breath! 😂😂😂😂
LOL!
But Johnathan, what do you realy think of Boris?
But Johnson looks at his bank account then does not care.
Now don’t beat about the bush Jonathan. What are you wanting to say? Lol.     Love it and it’s all true.
Excellent. All truth for once. Johnathan Pie should really be a BBC news correspondent.
He was also a liar.
He’ll probably join Labour!
And do you still believe boris about covid ? and the Jab been safe ?
"a boiled sweet in a hoover bag...!" hahahaha. I nearly wet  myself laughing so hard at that!! Well done sir, well done!! 🤣🤣👏👏
They're all liars. They all have dirt on each other. The people levelling the accusations are as big a bunch of cunts as Johnson is. Congratulations on your BBC contract.
Thank you Colin!?! 😂😂😂😂
To Boris Johnson,no more no less than this - "But man, proud man, Dress'd in a little brief authority, Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd— His glassy essence—like an angry ape Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens, Would all themselves laugh mortal." More will come We need to be vigilant.
Wow, he even took to the haircut for this one
Jonathan Pie should be our PM. No doubt about it. ;)
Remember when this no mark was funny.. shame he's an establiahment tool..
Go Pie!  God, we’re going to miss these Boris rants….
All completely true. 👏👏👏
Balloon 😂
Thank fuck he's gone(for now)
We now have a new term for a lying cnut: JOHNSON.  Hope you're proud of your JOHNSON of a son, Stanley.
We need to set up a GoFundMe page for you to come visit America. We should be able to get you a work visa as a consultant to CNN in other news outlets that need help with communicating the absurd. Thank you. I just replaced Boris with dumpster. It works for me for now
Epic. And factual!
Lock up the Scammers!
Is this the great reset? I wonder who’s head is next on the chopping block? I won’t vote anymore, I wouldn’t wanna be even remotely responsible for putting any of these monkeys in the position of power, stop the world....I wanna get off! Can’t trust anyone these days, hung parliament next year? I hope so... by the neck if possible!
I'd pay real money to have Jonathan Pie appear at Prime Minister's Questions... Just think how much money could be made selling popcorn...
Boris Johnson young Mrs must be cursing the day she met Boris. I am certain she has been told quite a few lies too
Don't hold back JP 😂
Yep - just about sums it up
You put into words what  many of us are thinking. Totally agree with every single word!!! Well done
Absolutely fking Brilliant!! 100% FACT!!
imagine being one of the thick cnuts who voted for him?
Is he wearing a wig 🤔
But what do you really think, Jonathan?
Love this guy
To borrow a Monty Python song: "Brave de Pfeffel ran away Bravely ran away When danger reared its ugly head He bravely turned his tail and fled... Bravest of the brave - de Pfeffel!"
Private Eye's cover just read: "Boris Johnson resignation special: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha etc etc" across the whole front page at the news. Kind of sums it up.
😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣 it's a shame it so serious lol
Looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag - I spat out my beer.!!
Brilliantly delivered and scaringly accurate!
Jonathan Pie you are sheer stress relieving genius, saying what we all feel! There is a brilliant Scottish word ‘bawbag’ which I have always felt suits the Bawbag perfectly! Thank you for the sanity rant! 🙏🏼👏👏👏
Pig in a hay bale, lol
It’s so nice to hear my inner voice spoken to a sleepwalking Britain
3:16 I hope this is a direct quote from the Partygate report.
Liked the bbc sounds Calling Jonathan Pie series. Mostly just as angry but just as serious/amusing.
Mr Pie, for those of us in the US, your stream of invective is nothing short of cathartic. It's a vicarious pleasure, but I'll take it.
Pie, you HAVE to do a "spot the difference" essay of trump vs bojo. they're basically identical.
Should he be tried for treason? For his actions in misleading the country over brexit, lying to the Queen?
I'm afraid that Boris going isn't going to change a thing. Conservatives are all deliberately working against the public interest for private gain. That will not change, the only thing that will is impeahing the entire government, who all knew, or at least suspected the truth, just too selfish to admit that they are as culpable as the PM when issuing dicates and lawas, then breaking them.
Best thing about this - Pie hasn't toned things down now he's got a promoted BBC iPlayer podcast.
I am sick of hearing about the narcissistic, utterly-deceitful, truth-manipulating, power-obsessed clown who has succeeded in inflicting so much damage to this country and its people. No doubt, we shall all hear his name being frequently mentioned again and again and again in the weeks and months to come as he attempts to turn himself into a political martyr in order to gain  a position of power and influence, again. It's all about Boris Johnson's addiction to power and little else.
Absolutely brilliant summing up of an oxygen theiving waste of skin. Thank you Johnathen Pie for the truth.
Why all the amazement, like no one knew all this, even from his first appearance on HIGNFY, where Hislop disembowelled him!
At some point, lying politicians, where their lies have a real negative impact on peoples lives or a significant negative impact on the effective functionality of politics, need to be prosecuted. In The Clown's case, I recogn this amounts to about 137 years porridge.
And still they elected him.  Idiots.
Don't forget lying about the benefits of various lockdowns!
Yes.. Bojo is terrible but the reason he's being pushed out is because he got Brexit done and that infuriated the global oligarchy and the City of London.
Bloody love it, bang on with the anology ( Cunt)
He'll get into the lords, people will forget
Punishment what punishment? He needs a sledge ride down Whitehall for treason.
Boris Johnson  Deceit and lies  A Turd encrusted  In Emerald flies
I fucking love Johnathan pie
Let's not forget Brexit. He was one of those whoresons of the apocalypse.
And people still want to vote him into office.
Do u have to talk to ur ex wife before filming so u can get filled with such hatred to boiled sweets in hover bags😂
Johnson didn't maintain his position by himself.
Time to rid ourselves of the Tory SCUM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Thank you Colin!" Remember that "photo-op," where he rugby tackled a little kid to the deck & took off with the ball? He was in his element that day. In stead of messing around with the little scamps & letting them win, he simultaneously went for the poor ten year olds kneecaps & balls, almost breaking the kids back in the process! The signs were there & how some people were taken in by the c#nt is mind blowing.🤯
Oh, that switch in midstream toward the end...
100% said
Spot on as always!
Fact adverse - priceless.
Brilliant as usual
😂
He lied about Brexit and the stupid English fell for it!
You begged for harder lockdown which eliminated all parliamentary procedure, worse than any lie about a cake. You hypocrite.
OOOF! 👊😆 Back and brazen as ever, I will hopefully be coming to see you again live as you were the tits last time!
Boris is a disgrace and will be knighted accordingly ✌
I'm sorry, I haven't paid much attention recently to your version of our (U.S.) previous president. It sounds like the two of them are cut from the same cloth. I feel for you having to deal with the same awful and disgusting ways they have performed as "leaders".  Our piece of shit has been indicted for espionage, among his other looming charges and legal proceedings. 75% of our country have celebratory champaign awaiting the day  he is sentenced and hopefully incarcerated. Yours, and ours, sound so similarly corrupt. I will not name them. Good luck to both our future's.
Ffs
He was extremely drunk and on coke the whole time, remember
we've missed you
He wasn't leveraged or shoehorned into Power in order to wield Power, he was put there in order to distract attention away from where Power actually resides.  So: A pathologically shameless, but useful, Court Jester with silly hair, only with the ability to amuse and disarm the Proles with erudition, faux charm and a plummy-voiced, pricey education derived from Eton/Oxford. (Apologies to the late, great magnificent Douglas Adams (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) and with a nod of acknowledgement to Zaphod Beeblebrox, aka "President Of The Galaxy....  ("World King" was a little limiting in his ambition) (Oh, and George Orwell for the Proles reference, "1984" should be required reading for Humans) Hence Johnson will be rewarded magnificently for the remainder of his filthy, flagrant, fornicating, flabby, favour-seeking & flatulent existence. He knew the Real Deal from Day 1. You Guys get to talk about it, shake your heads in Brexrospective despair and worry about your household bills. And I'm pissed. This is a good day.  Vaya Con Satanas, Mr Johnson.
Johnson is a liar, bully and a cheat. He has destroyed our economy killed thousands by his Covid incompetence. Sending infected old people into care homes.  His lack of patience and thoroughness being his normal work patern ensuring failure at every level. He has demeaned politics and dragged it into the gutter.
Johnson is an absolute disgrace. He has disgraced this nation for the worse.   The two worst things that happened to us were Tony Blair the murderer and Boris Johnson the complete loser.
Tell us what you really think JP.
When he said "Thank you Colin" right at the end I was expecting him to say "Thank you Colin from Portsmouth' then my head really would have exploded.
Does that mean brexit was a lie, and can be duly cancelled?
I don't think anyone could have said it better and with the right amount of disgust. 👍
Eddie Mair called Boris 'a nasty piece of work' to his face in an interview. King shit.
The most depressing thing about this story is that you can't get away from it!
Say it like it is Mr Pie😂😂😂😂
He looks more like a raw, pork meatball that's been dropped on a Swedish barber shop floor.
thanks mate, i needed that
Perfect. Thank you.
Foi Gras infused sh*t .. absoulutely classic line!
Brilliant!
He went to Elton,they don’t lie,ask his teddy bear,it wasn’t me it was the sneaky socialists
Thank you. I’ve missed you.
JOHNSON SAVAGED BY PIE! Did he deserve it? Hell yeah.
Another excellent video and spot on although still too complimentary to Boris IMO.😁  Boris Johnson a man who's been sacked from 4 jobs for lying. The man with the fecal touch who turns everything to shit. A man who ticks every one of the 20 personality traits on the psychopath test. A man so incompetent that he couldn't find his own arse with both hands, which when you consider he's a TOTAL ARSE is quite some achievement.  I'd say good riddance but like a turd that won't flush I'm sure he'll be back💩.
Brilliant as always mate
😂😂😂👌🏾
“Fact-averse” - perfectly said.
A good slice of truth Pie is always a wonderful thing.
0:38 "....or if he's just thick as fking sh!t" He's both.
"A wounded balloon" 😂 🎈 😂 🎈
Just perfectly said, I feel so much better now for your rant, thank you
The US Republicans should learn something from British parlamento enough is enough!
So what exactly are you saying jonathan 😂😂😂😂😂
#JonathanPie nice summer cut 🙌
"Startled pig in a haybale" 😂🐷😂🐷😂
Great - so everyone will stop talking about Boris now yeah?....yeah?...
I remember when everyone said his was like the next churchill, I also remember my inside voice screaming at them saying you stupid f**** you have no idea how shit he is, you're just voting for the charm.
Class
Build. Back. Better. 🤣🤣🤣
Spot on JP ❤
Thank you.
All of this is nothing more than a smokescreen very much similar to the trump smokescreen in America  and it would not surprise me in the  least if trump became president again . as it wouldn't surprise me if Johnson took power again here in years to come . the whole things a shitshow nothing more .
Brilliant Segmet Loved it 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Perhaps when the utter see you next Tuesday goes for another morning 'Jog' and I use that term loosely... He can do us all a favour and stick to his promise of ending up in a ditch!..... 😊🤞
As always with your observations and deliverance,  absolutely spot on Jonathan. As a youngster, were you that kid that had the balls to tell the emperor in his new clothes that he was actually stark bo11ock  naked?
Do you get the feeling Boris is that thick he thinks hes popular in the country. !
Wow, strong words but apt!!! Made me laugh. Disgraceful,  this country encouraged this swine. All the old ladies loved him "oh Boris is lovely,  give him a chance" well now you are paying the price of that chance.. Now he's  probably set himself up in the Ukraine, (please God don't  let him mess that country up). Mind you they are already in a mess sad to say.
Good Work Mr Pie
Spot on! It is impossible to describe johnson without using a few expletives , and you used them with such passion! Thank you, this was the version of events I wanted to see.
He did this in his entire life, from his early carreer.
The best description of BJ
People voted for him…didn’t they?
How was he to know it was a party, there was hardly any cocain and only a couple of prostitutes? Not a party by the conservatives standards.
Can't wait to see Jonathan on stage next year. Spot on as always 👌
I wonder how Charlotte Owen got her peerage? Wouldnt have anything to do with her looking like Carrie Johnson, but in her 20's would it?
God bless Pie!!
Harsh punishment? yeah, i'm sure he is going to suffer while sipping champagne in whatever million pound mansion he chooses to dwell in at the time. If that was me, or any one of us, we would be in prison, do not pass go, lose your house, access to your kids, fined out of the arse, and have a criminal record for life. Don't talk to me about punishment, when these cretins in power can kill us with impunity (iraq war= 500.000 dead, austerity= 320.000 dead)and only get a slap on the wrist. we need to be tougher on these fucks, just like they are "tough on crime", we need to be "tough on Toffs"
Seriously, who gives a shit if he went to some damn party, or not.   Who cares?? A politician lies....water is wet....and fire burns.  These are the natural order of things.
Nice portrail of that man
Spot on, I think you got it all in there
Always a fan of the use of the word "cunt" and it was nailed perfectly
You can´t even say he is a piece of s**t as shit at least can be used as a natural compound in plants, not Boris
Boris Johnson, like Trump, is a narcissist. Narcissists are ALL about what THEY WANT and they are very seldom held to account because they manipulate the system, by lying, cheating, and stealing if needs be. Trump and Johnson are now facing consequences that they have never in their life had to face before and it is infuriating them and as a result they lash out at everyone around them and try to put the blame where ever they can to distract from the horrible things they have done. They are classic manipulators but it isn't working now and they are furious.
Absolute bollox,  its all a big distraction .
All mps are full of shit no new news team red team blue
I always love to hear Pie tear BoJo to shreds!
That’s what I call a Pie in the face for Boris!
More Masterclass’s 😂😂🥳
I really do wish Boris was a victim....of the rise in knife crime!  Absolute twat
Spot on the money as usual Jonathan. Love you mate and I'm not even gay 😆
Fantastic. . Well done Sir. . 👍👍
Brilliant from Pie as usual 😂😂😅
James on LBC much cleverer take down !!!
U T T E R L Y  B R I L L I A N T ! Thank you, sir! ❤ Paul 😎
It’s not even for now is it? He’s in the news MORE than ever. I’ve just had enough of all of this! Fuck the Tories I hope their party is annihilated.
Johnson is like some shut vampire film you have been forced to watch ! You think he’s been dispatched and then some Toff sycophant goes and drops some coked up nose blood in his mansion and  resurrects the child of the dammed ! God help us all .
Lying about it is just a bone that got thrown to the general public to distract the population from the real crime: Of course he didn’t lie about it, because parliament already knew as well as he did that Covid 19 was NOT the threat they were making it out to be. That’s why he won’t admit to lying. There was no lie to parliament - only to the British people. They partied because they knew THERE WAS NO THREAT.
BJ was a dreadful mayor, too!
How you didn't pop during that, i do not know. "He's not wurf it, Johnny!" bellows Danny Dyer as he holds you back in a bear hug from behind.
You nailed it Jonathan 👍
Pie. Your hair. Is your stylist in the House of Lords too??!!  Kidding- keep going. I’m so angry I’m tussling my own bouffant
Great stuff
Beautifully put sir
My Pie. You are my hero
At least Britain’s “trump” can do no real damage to the country.
He lied under oath. Jail him for perjury.
Oh my. This is beautiful vitriol of the highest quality! Bravo!
Don't know why but for some reason I'm starting to suspect that maybe Jonathan Pie isn't Johnson's biggest fan...
He’d rather be a coward than a loser. He’s kept a reputation for being a “winner” in tact for any potential comeback. 🤮
BREXIT is great, my daughter has gone from 4 hour slots to 8 hours with paid breaks [like we used to have before tony Blair] I would vote again as long as all the gash from the EU FO!
I love watching my daily dose of Pie, he's saying what a lot of us are thinking and isn't afraid of doing so. God Bless Jonathan Pie for always speaking truth and common sense! 👏👏👏
This guy is a riot. Brilliant!
This has been well worth the wait!
And he stopped a peace deal. All them young men dead because of him and his puppet master Joe Biden. A evil evil monster
Leave Trump ALONE, Jonathan!
Beautiful, shine on J ✌️
This is such a sad Day for the Majority of a Minority .  Yippee .
He was repeatedly assured by the voices in his head that no rules were broken. Ipso facto no lies.
Nailed it?!!! Absolutely bastard and coward. Tens of thousands of deaths will not be forgotten!!!
😂😂😂 you never fail to make me belly laugh 😂😂
You can say exactly the same thing about all the MP's there is absolutely no difference between any of them, all liars and cheats 🤬🤬
"Spray his foie grass infused shit all over our constitution"  oh waouw and holy f
Love JP. But his comment about Johnson being self-pitying resonated with me most. For me, it is his most despicable quality.
Just like Trump.
Absolutely 😁 brilliant...and so right.
Oh how I missed you
Jonathan Pie for Prime Minis…. NO!… Jonathan Pie for GOD! 😂
How do I get this guy a pint?
Fois gras-infused shit!😮😅
Tell us what you really think!🎉😂❤
TRUE.
I'm not sure why a pig in a hay bale is a bully but ok...
PLease go into politics
I Am going to report you for your disgusting behaviour !
BorisTheVirus ManslaughterMattHandjob EatOutToInfectSchools RishiRichScumbag CostOfConservativesCrisis
Brilliant straight talking and honest need more people like this rather than snivelling two faced self serving corrupt turds like we have so called running the government
The problem is, is that the police looked into his parties and only found him guilty of the one he was fined for.  The internal investigations THINK he breached covid lockdown rules.... Therefore because they THINK he did then he's guilty..... Typical bully boy tactics by the investigation.
There he is: Jonathan as good as it gets.  Awesome, that was/is masterclass niveau. Bravo.
13,000 plus thumbs up in 3 hours 76,000 views in 3 hours. The people are concerned.
Stop swearing !
Well... he is the British Trump.
Couldnt have said it better myself😂
These were not party’s, they we’re gatherings, politicians had to meet up, they we’re running the country !
Welcome back, Jonathan!
Brilliant stuff Tom,,Fucking floored here 🤣🤣 You need to do these a lot more often mate 😁
Reasonable arguments , well-expressed, not a lie in sight or in hearing. I'm convinced and will vote for you.
I know this is a farcical show but it is somewhat amusing that it provides a better commentary on the news. Love it
I missed your rants!!!!!! Keeep them coming pleaseeeeeee. You're the best. Spot on!!!!!!
Jonathan is full of shit. I mean first of all he says that Boris wasn't pushed out of anything. Well he was. He was pushed out of the anus of a donkey called Satan. It's just that some moron discovered his reed basket floating down the river and that bleeding heart idiot didn't do us the favour of drowning that child on the spot. I'm tired of the comedians who still believe there's a reason to be polite about these things!
Pie you are my Hero! 🤩
That's the sort of Pie I'd like to digest every day 🧐
Who really gives a f***. There seems to be a lot of petty vindictive individuals.
Nothing like a good bollocking from Mr. Pie. Once a week does wonders.
Still nothing about the Biden shitshow? The innocent Brits slaughtered on the streets of Nottingham? No. Let's talk about Boris Johnson instead.  Again.🙄
Yes, he's a genius.  Doing the same thing (lying) repeatedly and expecting a different result this time is the very definition of a genius.
Pie for PM!!!
I can't get enough of Jonathan Pie's righteous rants, and this is about what Boris Johnson deserves. He's a privileged person, he has no need to lie or cheat or bully, he is always going to be comfortable. He's made £6 million on the after-dinner speaking circuit since he stepped down as PM! Outrageous! Kudos to Tom Walker for finding a way to put into words how so many of us feel about this dreadful con-artist.
Arise Sir Jonathan Pie. 😂👍👍👌
And now Boris wants to join the Reform UK party so he can destroy that party too, as a Trojan horse of course !!
Awesomeness Pie style
You lost me at brexit, i thought you were a bit more clever than that ! out out out from you brainwashed clever people !
Have you ever thought about writing and giving eulogies? I’d love to go out with a bang ‼️
The man that used to burn 50 pound notes in front of homeless people turns out to be a complete c*nt, what a shocker.
Spot on
you seem a little angry.
Ahh.. Bojo.. a bit like a Pound Land Donald Trump...
Marvellous!!! 😂
English grammar school (old boy) culture
Succinctly put! 👏👏
the voice of a nation, thanks JP
I have a serious question , if bojo stood naked in front of a mirror would he be able to see his member of parliament ? You see if no how the fuck does he manage it with Carrie . Fun fact they both met on a dating website called portly partners , how quaint .
Jonathan, 100% totally agree will all your thoughts, bit worried you decided to model your hair style the same though 🤣 keep up the great work
Genius.
Remember every mp got 250,000 pounds payment at the start of the pandemic and also allowed to claim more expenses not suprised that keir and Boris kept voting for lock downs
10/10
"We need to find out if he lied or is unbelievably stupid."  Neither of those options are good in the leader of a country...
Love you J Pie. Hope the BBC have let you loose on this new show
🤣Ah, does this tell us why Boris gets on so well with T****?  Another politican who is averse to facts.  Only T***** is by far worse--per evidence noted in his most recent indictment.   Lying and hiding documents from his own lawyer...the cluster**** goes on!  Cut from the same cloth, one could say.
This rant should be ran on every channel until the dopey fucks that think he did a good job get the message...
Just out of this world!
But some believe him
Please, please please. I want the BBC to air Jonathan telling the factual truth. More chance of Mogg giving his Knighthood back. Both are a laughing stock to most Brit's. A complete waste of human species.
Its just a witch hunt to ensure he cant become leader again, same as trump. Everything was much better when they were in charge and if it wasnt fir covid theyd still be in charge.
Spot on as Usual ,JP. ! And Funny as the F-word, As ever ....,.
I love this guy, I wish he'd do more on Trump, we need him for this, especially now he could have a field day with all the shit Trump is going through!! ※\(^o^)/※
Wheres your video about the Murders? We are sick of hearing about Bojo
“Wounded balloon”. That’s one of the best Pie’isms of all time 😂
Brilliant
Oh my, and thank you Mr Pie. Your service to our country and our mental health should be honoured.
Very much to the point
We gravely need an American version of “Jonathan Pie”…
Boris is a phenomenon. He appointed Sue Gray, he accepted her findings, all was OK, until that new recruitmenty by Labour came out. Then half of Tories went bananas, how it was all a stitch up. HE accepted her findings FFS! He knew she was right in her conclusions! And even this nonsense JP pulled out, is just blah blah to have a final word. He knows they were right. He even got a chance to tilt it as unintentional misleading, the committee member was handling him a straw to grab and get out of this mess, but he kept lying. That is what Boris always does. He never knew any other way of dealing with things, always lying his way out of trouble. Until now.
There is still people who don't care and would still vote for him, because they would like to be like him, getting away with everything over and over, never having to actually face the consequences of his actions. He would be a disgrace for any political party with a shred of integrity, but I guess with the Tories he's fitting in just fine and still has his supporters.
It's all in the stinging letter from the master of Eton.  He wrote that Boris had an air of entitlement to him, which when you think of it, to stand out to the headmaster to a school of entitled kids really takes the biscuit.  It was also reported that Boris was a bully back then too.  I think Eton's advertising blurb should be 'Eton, creating the next generation of entitled, self absorbed, narcissistic pricks since 1440'
Good to see you back Jonathan Pie
Yet this oxygen stealer still claims he’s the victim
His incompetence during Covid cost 225000 people's lives.Lets see him lie his way straight into a noose.
I like a nice slice of anger pie.
❤
Good riddance
Hell yes
"Wounded balloon" Ha ha ha
I don’t care whether Johnson or anyone else had drinks and cake. I care that the Tories are scum and Johnson is King Scum, along with his vile toad of a father. Starmer is almost as bad. As Chunky Mark says, “we’re fked”
I like the fact that you used the word cun* to explain Boris. Can't think of a worse person to use that term...
Boris The Clown is scared of being in the wrong, he's given an enormous wake up call which explains why he's been playing mind games with people, he can't fool me that's for sure. What you say of him is SO Correct 👍
Is it worrying that Jonathan pie is now my white noise that I fall asleep to?
J P at his best. I so wonder what any tourists passing thinks of J P.
Absolutely on the money sir and as totallyfucking eloquent as ever, particularly when describing that pieceofshit formerly known as Bojo the bastardclown.
The best thing about Brexit probably is that Boris and his like can no longer be recycled in the European Parliament.
Brave Brave Sir Boris, Brave Sir Boris Ran away... When danger reared it's ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled. Yes, brave Sir Boris turned about And gallantly he chickened out.
JP is the absolute GREATEST ….. I so, so, so wish he’d do one of these on Trump & Putin !!!! This comedian who tells the absolute TRUTH ball out every-time is the BEST. I never miss a dish out - kitchen sink full- BOTH TAPS if you please,  satirical viewpoint on these lowlife politicians who’ve ruined a country & now run like rabbits. Just brilliant. Keep it up Jonathan💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🤣🤣🤣🇮🇹
Old Bill Shakespeare would have enjoyed that strenuous nettle thrash of language immensely, no doubt...or Bill Blake...
Aaaaaah!...better than sex.
And yet he's given the Victorian zombie wanksock a Knighthood!
This must what passes for edgy political satire in the dead eyes of those hand-wringing, petite-bourgeois, liberal denialists that are still facing into the mainstream media's uninterruptable stream projectile faeces.  What a joke, what a f*cking tragedy.
I’m starting to get the distinct impression that Jonathan Pie doesn’t particularly care for Boris Johnson.
Why don’t you just say what you really mean?😂
he could be both thick as shit and a liar
"Fred Westminster " got his just deserves and he should get more ... please excuse the Fred Westminster quip as that is offensive to Fred West🫣
Pig in a hay bale is brilliant!
Truly Great.
Thank you Jonathan. I feel better for that.
Johnson was is and always will be a liar, i think he gets his kicks from it, how the hell he ever got to be an MP let alone PM is beyond me, sadly it just shows how people can be hoodwinked by ' charisma' and if you tell a lie enough times then it must be true. Hopefully its by bye boris never to return
God I miss Pies rants! We need more of them please. Loving the podcast btw
Rishi also attended the parties, and he’s the PM. Rules only apply to some.
Ive enjoyed your take on things but its a shame you joined BBC. I have to question your integrity now
If he tried and failed to become party leader for the second time.  If he tried and failed to get re elected as the ( fucking useless) MP for Uxbridge, then his earning potential as an after dinner speaker in the USA would be shattered. The yanks don’t pay losers.  So he’s quit claiming a “ witch-hunt “. Which he organised and approved.  The walking turd.
Pretty much sums up with the mess the Tory party is in lol 😂😂😂
You can take the boy out of Bulligdon but you can't take Bullington out of the boy.
More truth from JP in three minutes than we have had from Johnson in his 20 plus years of being an MP.
If he tried and failed to become party leader for the second time.  If he tried and failed to get re elected as the ( fucking useless) MP for Uxbridge, then his earning potential as an after dinner speaker in the USA would be shattered. The yanks don’t pay losers.  So he’s quit claiming a “ witch-hunt “. Which he organised and approved.  The walking turd.
thank you.  Unfortunately you are still not going to run out of material to work with.
Utterly brilliant as usual Jonathan!
Aloha; it's so nice to have you back. AND that biting editorial! Mahalo
As Meatloaf would say, "You took the words right out of my mouth." Farewell (for now) to Billy Bunter Bullshit.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️.  Jonathan says it exactly as it is ❤️❤️
And today's competition question is.. Name a politician who has never lied
Nice outro
Between Jonathan Pie & Trae Crowder I get all the news I need 🤣
Tom Walker become Jonathan Pie full time there’s something very sexy about a good rant
Saying everything that James o Brien wished he could say on LBC. Gunna book my tickets ❤❤
I was only speaking to a pig in a hay bale last week, I thought I was being fed bull shit. 😮 Jonathan you are one of the only people that can hold a torch to the  turd that politics currently is through which we can see a glimmer of light.
Hear! Hear!
If I had one wish, it would be to see Boris watching this video 🤣🤣🤣. The problem is that people like Boris and Trump don't seem to have any shame, but I can dream.
Thank you.
OMG,,,,,,,This is brilliant....and he used my favourite sweary word, the one youtube keeps punishing me for the hunts......c......😅
Bravo! 👏
Cut the grass, sir - shabby man's lawn heard here too.
How do you really feel about Boris?
instaclick
Who are these people spouting off? Too much conjecture and scrutiny, not enough substance. The language on this video is rude and offensive. That's something Boris is much above. 🙃
foie gras infused liquid shit
Top quality Pie (again)!
What a pottymouth full of bile.
Like a cool glass of water on a hot day. Thank you JP.
Pie for PM  !!!!  Make it so !!!  He'd get my vote 🗳
Maybe the best rant ever!!
Was it at his home?
I love your comedy, especially the American bits.
Love this guy.
But who is surprised it ended this way? Predictable for Trump. Predictable for Johnson.
The back of Boris should have the Western world's most desirable target on it. Just Slaying. . .  🗡🎯
Dear Jonathan or Tom, would you please take over the BBC after the Tories have been sent to hell? I'm trusting a fictional sarcastic comedian more than the official news presenters there.
I wonder how many people don't realize that this guy and Mo the mechanic are state sponsored propaganda?
A pig in a hay bale of a bully...that is perfect
Boris needs to reveal all and just bring the rest of them down.
Fuckin awesome.
Nice one well done Mr Pie
Can't wait to see your live tour again!
😊
"A boiled sweet in a hoover bag"
Imagine, corbyn can stand for and will be elected, Johnson bravely ran away, are you watching starmer, that's what lying gets you.
Thank your choice of Middle Eastern Sky Fairy for Jonathan Pie. We sorely need the likes of him here in ɐᴉlɐɹʇsn∀ so he can rip the Tory LNP a new arsehole. Not that they have been, or are,  short of those.  Poor fella my country.
Nation surprised that pathological liar is a liar. Again.
Excellent work Lord Pie and another fine video of home truths. I vote for you to be our next PM, as for your phrase... he is a f*****g lying c**t are my sentiments exactly. This fucking idiot tosser could power his own fleet of zepplins with all high gas and gas lighting bullshit. I am not going to pay my council tax anymore to those thieving warmongering snobs who let their own people suffer whilst dishing out missiles like free school dinners. Deconstruct this corrupt government then rebuild it with us, the people, and not them; the WEF's dog bodies.
We Americans are not much privy to British politics because of our awful MSM.  So, a favor to us, please?  Jonathan, you've been very up to speed with our criminal ex-president.  May we expect a likewise glorious tirade about him? 🤔 Thank you in advance. 👆
Classic! And so glad to have the 'boiled sweet' zinger as a bonus too.
Sad that he is smiling all the way to the bank and can now afford gold wall paper without public money
Yet again criticising BJ is a waste of precious energy and vocabulary
From this gather Tom has a fairly low opinion of BoJo. 😁
Thank you … we needed that 😂❤
An utterly repugnant, entitled, posh, bullying liar
Top Notch'  J P.
Jonathan pie make me laugh
It's cute.  At least your way lesser of a POS is going away.  Hooray!  🥧   Have a slice of that.
The producer at this news station really needs to be fired. How is is that they forget the camera on EVERY SINGLE TIME?
The sudden stop due to being back on air caught me off guard 🤣.
have to be sent to prison, thats the only way the people can pull in the government now and for  the future
well said, Pie!
This about sums  it up🤔
damn...I gotta get me one of those shirts with the middle finger.
I was wondering when this video would happen and whether it would be angry about Alexander Boris dePfeffel Johnson's lying on the way out or just an hour of joyful dancing.
We need more Pie.  I miss these short clips of Jonathan shouting what we all feel!!!
Jonathan Pie , welcome back 👌👌👋👋
Shocked to see pie so on Boris' side. 😊
he admits to being somewhere he shouldn't have been but doesn't see how he shouldn't have been there.  yep that logic checks out for elitist prickery.
Political assassination or self-immolation by negligence? Well said, Jonathan, as usual 👏
Just love it 😀
Mate. Your Podcast was fucking hilarious. The cracking hymens line had me spitting out my Coffee. Bravo.
Its so cathartic that even the morally bankrupt Tories are even sick of this prick
Nailed it Mr Pie
This is beautiful
Borris Johnson is the male equivalent of Elizabeth Holmes, he lied and made up stuff just for the betterment of his own wealth and career, he's bullshited and wormed his way though. Elizabeth was found guilty for fraud over billions of dollars. Boris should be thrown in Jail under the same morral light
Wonderful !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well Done, best use of 3.45 minutes on YouTube this year so far  !!!!!!   Excellent !!!!
The sycophants will still back him, just in case he gets back in power and gives them a knighthood!
Tea pot for steam release....
thanks for venting out our temper, very therapeutic 😌
😂
So generally speaking, Johnson is a liar. Well glad that's been cleared up.
He'll throw anyone under a bus, and scribble more lies on the side of it
A lovely rant!!!😂😂❤👍🏻
Legend
Always good to have a dispassionate and neutral commentator
Good to see you back on Youtube...Just finished your 10 episode 'Call Jonathan Pie' show on BBC Sounds.  Absolutely brilliant, can't wait for season 2
Good to see you again                            jonathan;  but you are lucky   ~~~~~~~~  We will trade you happily Boris for the great Canadian Turd, TURDEAU
Johnny Pie, just doin’ Gawd’s work😁
гадит
and if anybody says they would still vote for him cos he's a good old boy should have their right to vote snatched from them them forcibly through their ARSE with as much pain as possible until they use their brains
Cut the language
That was the very last Jonathan Pie piece about Boris there will ever be!  Now his political career is finally finished.   Ha ha ha ha just kidding that's one turd you can't flush.
Who looks up to Trump as a hero. Sad!
Boris is a nasty lier! Our society has failed as we as citizen seem to accept these liers.
Great, but why hold back?
Like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂😂
The best ever use of the word kundt
He's the equivalent of the chorus in the Simon and Garfunkel song "The Boxer".... lie lie lie, lie lie lie lie lie, lie lie lie.
He broke the law but the law was stupid (since it applies to privileged toffs such as him) therefore he committed no offense. I mean, he wasn’t offended by his own behavior so… OTOH, the committee offended him plenty and so is probably illegal, immoral and invalid at the very least.
3:16 was beautiful
Wonderful commentary, just what we need to cut through the bull.
LOVE THIS MAN
Great to see Pie back on YouTube
im chuffed he is gone now he will cry from sidelines like the looser he is good riddence pity more never followed him but seems he aint as popular as he thinks he is he is a joke of a man a man-child even takes petulant tantrums when things dont go for him i suggest to follow his money also as he and his buddies been stealing for thier pockets for years  as for sunak anyone think he will stay in britain after he aint in politics i recon he will move to where his money is ie india or america
Does he still have American citizenship , deport the bastard .
He's a big old Liebag!
Geez you went a bit easy on him there...
Wonderful to hear JP's evisceration of the abominable Johnson...... I ❤ this man!
Correct as usual...
Nailed it
and the british has been proven SO stupid since brexit they will happily vote him in again so he can "fix the problems". thank FUCK the UK is out of the EU.
I can't wait for you to turn your Sauron eye on Starmer. YouTube will delete this comment but Starmer is a sight more dangerous than any of those appalling tories. Starmer will be the last straw in the downfall of a democratic UK
MAGIC" THE EXACT THOUGHTS OF ANYBODY WITH A RATIONAL MIND, SUPER JOB PIE" AS USUAL, CHEERS. MINT."
😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
exactly what I thought 😂 you are right on the money
I’ve been waiting for this.
Pie knew it all along
I love this guy. The stoic, well mannered, well-coifed and groomed... and then just brutally honest and blunt, Brit. Always liked that about our cousins 'across the pond' no one knows how to use English.... like the English.
I wish he reported for the BBC 😂
John Pie for PM
You got that right Jonathan, the similarity between Boris and Trump is obvious, both odious chaps!
Pie could be describing Trump
All the Tory MP'S including Rishi Sunak not once did they challenge Johnson for fear of there jobs, you mentioned Gaslighting Rishi Sunak doing the same even lying.
Lovely stuff
The Withhunt of Boris by Jonathan (actually a Labour activist) Pie........
Johnson will blame everyone but himself, he has been found out and now it’s time for him to bugger off! The only thing he can stomach is a free lunch,as for the truth well that’s over and hopefully is his future too.
A genius expression of how angry we all should be
Britain loves liers
Now everyone has a go, but the truth is people voted for him, Tories chose him for the leader and he was PM and all these already knowing Boris is a liar - now everyone forgot they supported him
... a boiled sweet in a hoover bag ...
Oh dear...Jons  ban list just expanded..those C Bombs...ka boomba. .💥
Now tell us what you really think Jonathan and this time don't hold back! lol
Blonde gorilla who chucks shi…e at everyone all the time.
its so good to hear you in full rage rant. You speak the truth but sadly Joe Average will never tune in. Please keep up the assault and keep telling it like it actually is.
Cockwomble comes to mind 😂😂😂
“A pig in a hay bale”  Howling🤣. Preach Pie PREACH🤣😆
Boris is now outside the tent pissing in as opposed to inside pissing out.
U are pukka mate 👍 😅
🥱 yawn
Jonathan rocks - Boris can go ... himself and about time, too.
I'm now waiting for the next scandal to break. The one where Honey Monster Boris stuck his sugar puff up Nadines chocolate cheerio. Let's be honest, that would make more sense as to why Dorries off her Lorries is behaving the way she is.
"...a gaslighting bag of...gas!" Thumbs up.
He did indeed turn out to be 'Britain trump'.  Him and his mates have screwed the country in ways we'll never recover from. Brexit was final nail in the coffin of a once pretty cool and influential country.  Now the only thing we have is a witch blaming everything on the 'woke' and trying to force us to be 'pay-triotic' because jingoism will pay the bills. And a PM whose big selling point is knowing what to call an adult female because of all else fails, lean on the 'culture war'. You may be remembered for the bigotry, but you can worry about that when you leave office and get a job working two days a week for some multinational company and getting paid 100 million a year while we get to pay for your protection and your pension.  To top it all off, if Labour ran out of our money last time when they inherited a good economy, what's going to happen when they inevitably inherit _this_ economy?  All I know is I can't see myself living in this country in the future, although I'm hoping a certain overseas territory will be cool. Other than that, I'll probably head to Germany or preferably, the Netherlands
I have been dreaming of this rant...
Clean and to the point. So I guess you do not rate him as a politician, farther or/and human. LOL
Pie your camera's been out of focus for like 2 fucking years now.
Now THAT last bit was a gear change worthy of someone with EUPD! :P A master at work ;D
And yet, in Westminster, you are punished worse for calling out the liar and the lies than for being a liar and for the lies. The "Mother of Democratic Parliaments".
He wants the King to knight a man who partied the night before his dads funeral.
I am SO looking forward to seeing JP in February at Warwick University - an EPIC evening!  OUR HERO!
EPIC rant as usual sir.😂 but i still can't get over Jonathan pie at the fucking bbc,the FUCKING bbc,why?
And what does this say about the state of our democracy that people who should have known what he was like (it was not secret) still voted for him. We get the politicians we deserve.
Why are we all not as angry as Jonathan pie , know I am.thank you Jonathan for expressing my views
Love Johnathan Pie. This guy can elequoantly express what we all wish to say in a language only the elite and powerful would heed!
Best rant ever
So bozo is gone. What will you do when it's starmer in there and he doesn't repeal anything the tories put in to law? When you figure out that starmer is worse than boris?
Absolutely fucking nailed it.🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨
I wish you were leader of the opposition, no-one would dare stand up to you.
A Pie Classic😂Absolute bloody perfection 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
@3:15 I had to replay that several times because it's so gratifying to hear.
The politicians are all the same, and sadly so are your videos now. Expose the fraud, expose the failure of parliament and the king to protect our sovereignty.
Well Said!  Now do one about Trump!
Excellent
I mean, just say what you think 😂
Tories in a nut shell. Bunch of wankers.
Wow what a great video spot on with the truth 👏👏👏
Outstanding now do the Orange Shitgibbon
Boris johnston has help fuck up this country
Possibly your best work, Jonathan! Thank you very much!
That just about says it all about the grotesque liar.
Bloody marvellous 😂👍❤️💩
A boiled sweet in a hoover bag. 🤣
Boris haters are hilarious 🤣He's gone and still living rent free in the Lefties heads😂😂
'FG infused LS ' - brilliant!
I've been waiting for this! And, as ever, Mr Pie doesn't disappoint!
3:15 truth
Never mind about Boris, what about Khanage!!!???
The government took the nation into the mess we are now in ! Covid garbage was the start . They’re all pi**ing in the same pot ! 😡
Nearly EVERY politician lied about covid and lockdowns, they are all complicit, as are TV presenters, newsreaders, civil servants, SAGE, and various celebs
Replace BJ with DJT.
Amazingly true!
Awwwh the dribbling British aristocracy arent that bad ? What about sir jhodper beast bogg ! A very warm individual , who only has the    lower classes in mind 🧐🥴🤑
Thank you . I really needed that.
How about you just go away as you seem to think its ok to hound people out of office because you don't like them ie Borris/Corbyn who next little old ladies???
The name "Boris" is not going to be the name of a child in quite a few years. It will probably become an insult among the British.
He's precisely how he fu..ed up, yep, we accept that.
I’m sure his mum pushed him out….
Pig in a hay bale 😂
Media talking about it like it's a suprise,  knew this already, no suprise! 😅
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag!
What a come back!😊
Colin needs to stop interrupting.
Thank you yet again Mr Pie.
What's the next government plan to piss away taxpayers money?   Are they going to investigate if water is wet?
Always nails it right on the head!
A boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂
I've always thought the C word should be used sparingly so it's full force is felt when it comes out. This was a great example of that!
Wounded balloon 🤪😜🤪
Spot on as ever.
That felt like the shortest 3 minutes of my life, incredible what the truth does…
Graphically speaking, this Pie charts above all others! Keep 'em coming, JP.
This is quality writing and acting.
More worrying, the proportion of England that votes for this.
I wish he would do a video on how Cheney and Johnson have already got invites from Hitler and Pol Pot plan to meet up in Hell.
Please get back to youtube regularly! We miss you
indeed
Fred Westminster 😂😂😅😊
I have watched many vids on Boris this afternoon, all of which were very enjoyable. When i saw that you had one i knew it would be a CORCKER. Well done.👋👋👋
Hes the best lier thats why hes the best UK PM, the job fits his profile like a glove.
We need a Pie clone here in the states right now.
Boris Johnson,  Scott Morrison and Donald trump - 3 stooges.
Welcome back....at last 🙏🙏🙏😁
I always thought BJ was a hunchback due to the sheer weight of his lies, with a tiny part of him feeling the burden of guilt and eating away at his twisted corpse. Reminds me of a Picture of Dorian Gray in some ways
Direct from the Trump playbook. Its a conspiracy, I've been stabbed in the back, I'm innocent, their out to get me, I've done nothing wrong. I will come back because i am King !
Good use of the C word there. Reserved for those who truly deserve it.
It's the hairdresser getting m'lord shit, it's a total piss take!!
Yet he still has supporters! Shows how incredibly dumb many people are, same goes for the trump cult. I actually heard it said Trump was the greatest orator in US History! He makes 5 year old seem articulate. The film Idiocracy is going to be up there with Orwell.
Pi's commentary at its most subtle.  Sorry.  Devastating.  I meant devastating.  And honest.  11/10.
it must be really hard being a privileged white upper class man in Britain who has always had his mediocrity gassed up
👏👏👏👏👏
Hell is too good for that man
This isn't about cake.  This isn't about parties.  This isn't about a gay bloke pinching another blokes arse.  This is about Boris honouring the democratic mandate incumbent upon him to take the UK out of the European Union, a legacy that will be preserved regardless of the tantrums thrown by the minority in the UK and the majority in Brussels.  Forever in your empty heads, admission free.
Gosh I love you deeply. Please start an Indie party so we can vote you in.
And rishi sunak is  another lying greedy corrupt tory criminal.
Good riddance you will forever be known as a lying skidmark in the history of British politics
Well said. Jonathan Pie. LEGEND!
Nice to see you back on YouTube!  It’s been a while.
For good i hope, fucking liability, then now we've got a wog ,fucking brilliant
I really didn’t like Pie until the far-left nutters were stopped from writing for him. Now I think he is fantastic. The podcast is wonderful.
On behalf of the English Language may I extend thanks for “a boiled sweet in a hoover bag”.
Don't hold back man, tell us what you really think! Boiled sweet in a hoover bag set me off. 😂
The most depressing part is; knowing that we will go through all this again, simply because Conservatives are incapable of learning.  Just look at America!  That’s what happens when you replace facts with belief.
And yet whole tribes of voters believed all they were fed and even though these people now 100% know would happily do so again. It shows politics and people are completely messed up.
3:29 Is this the same "Colin from Portsmouth"? I thought he was in prision.
Boris could certainly give his mentor Donald Trump a run for his money. I suppose we were lucky to avoid an insurrection, by the way has he taken any top secret documents with him??............... FFS will the people of this country EVER learn anything, have they NO judgement of character. Boris was the biggest bull-shitter since Jimmy Saville.
Brilliant
I hope Johnson's wife dosen't bite him.
Public school does horrible things to people, then they go on to do horrible things to the country!!!
Amazing, you have boris we have trump. Holy shit.
J.P. level of restraint is impressive.
his honours list should be shredded, literally. If I was King Charles I'd refuse any of it.
Def a coward, being a puppet led by Sage
Used to be funny. Just bitter and nasty now.
They all lie
Yeah.  Sounds legit.
Fabulous work sir!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I had hoped you would weigh in on the Undescended Testicle's unlamented departure.
"Democracy is over rated". This democracy got a fwit like Bojo into the highest office. Who's to blame? us the voters!
So he resigned from the premiership before the 1922 committee vote, quit the leadership race when knew Sunak had a lot more support, saying for the sake of the party, then resigned before been served the punishment for misleading the parliament!! Can you see a pattern here? He’s a psychopath by the definition.
Who paid for all the booze?was it the taxpayers by any chance?
I get the distinct feeling that Jonathan doesn't like Boris very much...
Nover have I been so entertained as much by harsh truth. It’s shakespearien 😂
Oo, I just gotta see this tour!
Sounds a lot like someone we have on this side of the pond.
I know this video is mainly done for comedy but everything pie said is 100% true. Boris will spend the rest of his life in luxury after this when he should be in jail
😂😂😂😂funny as hell but on the flip side true
Boris is a narcissistic, sociopathic, pathological liar! And those Politicians who are defending him should go as well because they are similar.
Demons like Boris Johnson never die ... he will get a job at WHO and meter out even more tyranny just like Jucinda Arderne
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The "converted" have been preached to in classic no nonsense style. Now to convince the people that thought (and still think) he's a lovable rogue - that he and his cronies - should never be within a 1000 miles of Westminster.
Boris Johnson and his father and other members of his family are very corrupted people and bullying neighbours all the time so how Boris came to power as a Bribe Minister you have to finds who was his behind to support him.
What a waste of carbon he is.
Love it! Boris Johnson: Britain’s Trump. Forget “God Save The King,” it’s “God Save Us All” from these idiots!
The English Trump.
The only thing more depressing than the lies of the conservatives is the reality that their supporters are just as dumb and morally bankrupt that they make them into victims and essentially into martyrs of so called "freedom". The fascists have risen from the dead, yet again...
Boris never worked for the British people. He works for the adversary forces. So lying is not a crime in his world and comes naturally to him and with earthly rewards.
Woot woot!  Wonderful,nay, majestic tirade. Music to my ears.
these vids are so cathartic
He’s back & still angry 😂
Perfection ! Mr Pie 👍
This is identical to running away in Luxembourg...similar to an adulterer who has been found out...he worries are now that he can't earn so much in his speeches ...
A boiled sweet in a Hoover bag.   I salute you Sir.
I'd wish the rant went longer. One can never get tired of hearing enough how much of an imbecile that blob Boris is.
tru mate ❤😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Everyone has to hear, listen and REMEMBER the detail of this monologue!  It's perfectly put, in an imperfect society.
A bit understated and reserved .... but getting there .
Superb 😃
Don't sit on the fence mate, tell us what you really think 😆
Foie gras infused liquid sh*t😂😂😂
"A wounded balloon"
If i was prime minister the very first thing I'd do would be give Jonathan Pie a knighthood!!! 😊
please reproduce this with the name "Boris" replaced with the name "Trump" voiced by the guy who voices Homer in the Simpsons.
😂 hits the nail on the fukin head thankyou for cutting through the shit 👍
Thank you  ,  Pie  .  🐺
Brilliant! And spot on.
Jonathan Pie, the only political satirist left in the U.K who has any balls...
And in the future some Torie prime minister will make him a lord politicians always reward failure they make the law's and break the law's but they always bounce back watch this space 🧐
Brilliantly said. Here is  Canada, other than Brexit, your commentary, could be about our utterly be obot our PM Justin wanker Trudeau
Ok…..what’s going with your hair…..it’s cut like Boris’s……😱😱😱
Nobody rants quite like Jonathan Pie. I needed that, thank you!
Love you Pie!  Keep speaking for, an to, the people!
I needed a bit of Pie 😅
G8 to see tom back.
"Foie Gras infused liquid shit"  I'll remember that one for when I'm next on the audience of question time.
"Pig-in-a-hay-bale". Conjures up a marvellous image of Boris. Love it.
The man the myth the legend, Jonathan Pie is back ladies and gentlemen.
Exactly .
I particularly enjoyed '...his foie gras infused liquid shit...'
Calling Boris a piece of sh*t is an insult to the piece of sh*t.
Thank you Jonathan.  Please run for parliament.
Brilliant summary !
We have failed as citizens if the only character who can express what a lot of ppl feel is a YouTube comedy character. Where are you labour? We need to make them all work harder for our vote. We need ppl to actually vote! History suggests it's only after war or rampant unemployment do ppl bother to get out of their pit and vote. You get the gov you deserve. Vote.
Superb!
You honestly think he gives ash🌈t? He’s owned and has been used to do the bidding of his masters and he performed well
Jeez, get off the fence why don't you...
Poes!
i think we should scrap the bbc and just give pie all the money tbh OR when i am declared king.. well u know because i AM.. i shall make him SIR BBC news man.  love it when he says : Lying fucking cunt..   makes me proud to be british ^_^
Boiled sweet in a hoover bag 😂😂😂
Someone who doesn’t mince his words. Thank you for your honesty
Unlawful ? That means a law has been broken. That means the CPS fancy it. Anyone know the court date ?
Doublespeak
Perfect as always !!!!
Loving the BBC Sounds show!
As ever spot on; great to hear it said out loud.  🎉
But Harriet Harman...  It's annoying that there's so little push back from the Conservative members of the committee and that any of the Boris backing nutters don't have this thrown at them repeatedly in any interview they have in the media.
Honey Monster in a suit.  Hat tip to Marina Hyde for that one.
"Pig in a haybale."  Almost Shakespearean.
I have something to say if Boris really nearly died in hospital, and he had co I'd that bad   he divided to party and pass it on he's the biggest  lier on the planet  but then rishi sunak  is one of his team so he's no better another one who lies about his wife's tax payments
Are you available for hire? I have some people that need to get told off.
It's truly amazing that anyone cares. We all now know that all that staying inside, don't sit down outside stuff was absolute bollocks, so it's not like he even did something irresponsible. He just broke arbitrary rules which half of us ignored anyway.   He's a fanny - yes, we all know that. We all knew that 4 years ago too.
Always cheers me up
Bojo and his cabal started his/their training for public office at The Bullingdon Club. The abuses of those who scurried around serving them, wrecking restaurants, humiliating everyone and anyone who came within shouting distance, wasting and displaying their parents wealth as the self serving/entitled parasites & vermin they are.
Well said.👏
Jonathan, stop beating about the bush and tell us what you really think.
He probably is the most entitled person on the planet. He doesn't see it as lying or bullying because to him there is no difference between right and wrong its all about getting his own way every second of the day and who taught him all this..his parents? not sure....most likely Eton.
He did not do it alone, their is a long list of people who backed him up on camera. Why are they still there, a know bunch of liars.
And to think the Ukrainians actually worship is sack of piss and wind.
God, that felt good to get out. Venting by proxy is terribly therapeutic. Thank you, Mr Pie.
Mic drop. 10/10.
All the crap calling him Boris as if he is some man of the people. What a pile of old bollocks and if you voted for him, what a mug you are.
Boris is a clone of Trump
He should still do his 90 day suspension.  From a gibbet in Parliament Square.
Nailed it.
Boris Johnson's nonsense = Johnsense
Brilliant. :)
He also helped Brandon and Killary get a war going with Russia
Marry me!!! 😂❤❤❤ Brilliant!
Jonathan, I'm a big fan, but I strongly object to your demeaning pigs in your clip, there's really no excuse for it 😉
Yes, Jonathan.  YES. 👍
Sounds like trump..join the party😢
👏👏👏👏👏Thank you Mr. Pie for articulating so well what we all know anyway but you make it sound so much better... yes, Boris is and always will be, a complete Cnut
Boris will be back and he will save this country!
Perhaps a monologue on starmer's ability to make a pledge and not keep it. 😉😉😉
Come on now, Jonathan, tell us what you really think.
In all fairness to Bozo, he's both.
"Spraying foie gras infused liquid shit"..... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. As always, JP tells it like it is. I wish, somehow, somewhere, it was possible for JP to interview Johnston - it would be absolute carnage, and televisual gold.
Yeah, I think that about covers it. Well said.
There is talk of banning him from the house of commons, I would ban him from the UK
He’ll land on his feet though. That’s what he does.
nailed it as normal!
Absolutely perfect, can't wait for richy rich sunak the self entitled poisoned dwarf of parliament
Conservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen has described the committee's report as a "distraction" from the real issues people want to see the govermment deal with, like.... THE SHADY DEALS IN THE TEES VALLEY
When you think about it Boris and trump are like peas in a pod.
An MP lying!!  Well I never.  They all lie. All of them.
I went to see boris in Wandsworth pre london. Never would have imagined leading the UK😂
Thank you for being angry on my behalf, Jonathan. This was genuinely good. (Outsourcing my negative feelings to an imaginary character seems like the sort of breakthrough idea that could get me on tedious podcasts, doesn't it?)
📢📢📢 IT is obviously a Witch Hunt. The deep State and the radical Left  wants to destroy BoJo. The made up a Plan in the Basement of a Pizza Place in Crystal Palace to destroy him. Involved are Keir Starmer, Jeremy Corbyn, Prince Harry, Meghan, Piers Morgan and Michael Fabricant. Just a Witch Hunt. 📢📢
The only good thing to come out of the Johnson regime, and which helped give us a laugh in the darkest of times in Covid Riddled Brexitland, is Jonathan Pie. I've seen all his live shows (both pre and post covid) and have tickets for his upcoming tour in January.  You may not remember me Tom , but we chatted outside Bournemouth Pavilion on 2019 and I said you were doing the nation a vital social and therapeutic service - this is more true than ever, and for that may I thank you!
So you are saying you might support Johnson ?
The best and most appropriately used similes that I've heard in a long time. 😂
Can we assume Jonathan Pie is somewhat mildly irritated by Boris Johnson? He seemed rather unamused. Anyone top that for understatement of the year?
I've been needing a slice of Pie for a minute. Glad to see you back
Pig in a haystack is a brilliant visual metaphor.
I bet most of you people voted for Tories aswell haha
Yeah if i had to describe Boris in two words it would have to be "lying cunt".
"Done nothing but spray his Foie gras infused liquid shit all over our constitution". Blimey, the lad is on form today.😂
Great to hear Pie telling it as it is as always 😂
Pie for PM!!
Much like the legend of King Arthur, Jonathan Pie returns at a time when the nation needs him most.
😂
Bojo is a male version of Vicky Pollard from little Britain yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah
Great summation of the Blond Turd, missed a big bit though!  All the Tories were complicit by their silence. They are coming out now only because they don’t wish to go down the dustbin of history with him.
put him down, slap him on the bbq
A boiled sweet in a hoover bag LOL you can't summarise him better
But Bojo and his party of clowns are complete entertainment for the rest of the world and keeps Johnathan Pie in business, but realistically all the bastards should be behind bars for a very very long time and their assets stripped
Officially a liar and a bully.  Love it.
Pig in a haybail 😂😂😂
I used to wonder why we don't see those white dog turds any more which I remember from my youth. Turns out they amalgamated into one amorphous blob and came to life representing Uxbridge until earlier this week.
Yay hes back
Most passionate one yet? 😂 Couldn't agree more
Comedy gold as usual Tom! 😂
😂😂😂 a complete fxxing lying…. thank you Collin …. awesome.  perfect definition of narcissism
At last Billy Bunter has been caught with cream around his face after denying he stole the cake.
4k me, 😂😂 best one yet. ❤😂
Jonathan Pie, as always, you deserve a cake for putting it as it is.
Tom Walker looking dapper as always. He could afford the nicest of suits with his cash from propaganda outfit Russia Today. Did he pay income tax on those earnings? Tom won't say. But taxes are for the little people aren't they?
Thank you for having the balls to (correctly) blame those pathetic marger cunts in Uxbridge , Ruislip and associated horrible little places in the shitshow that is Hillingdon.
Boris Johnson = piece of lying sh*t, I have known this for some time now. Try not to mince your words @Jonathan Pie, tell us as it is,, 🤣
A big problem in the UK and America is that for too many people, party affiliation has become identity. Nothing can budge it. In that situation, it makes sense to have a loud lying loose cannon at the top. Your party gets the votes it would get anyway plus it picks up undecideds who 1. believe the lies because they want to believe them, 2. know he's a liar but vote for him as a f u to the very idea of responsible government.
Like Trump
So, does Dawn Butler get an apology for calling him out? Probably not.
You are not coming to continental europe, specialy germany, aren't you?
Yup. Fact.
Wow, dude, can you plug rump's name into that and release it in the United States? You could just as well be speaking of that pimple as the one you have to deal with - weird how bodge bailed the same day rump got indicted 🤔🙄or is it? Same people on both sides of the Atlantic up to no good with shady liars and thieves and apparently, morons that show off national defense information and? What else were they doing with it? You got lebedev in the House of Lords and oligarchs everywhere, and we got them and Saudis and who knows? Who shows a military contingency plan to people writing a crappy book for his former chief of staff, now star witness for the prosecution?
Pie for Prime minister
I can always count on Pie to say exactly what I’m thinking. To the letter.
Brilliant!
get me a bodaa of wadaa will ya !!😄
Scum such as Boris embody everything wrong with modern politics, not only because he is so immoral that he shouldn't have any say in how the country is run, but that his peers supported his appointment in the first place, despite know he's a liar. And there's also been zero accountability for the all the lies he told about Brexit and NHS. Mainstream media will just come up with another topic of distraction for the public, instead of actually taking a hard look at how fucked up everything is and demanding better.
Spot on Jonathan.  What a sad country this is.  They are all a bunch of lying bar stewards, they are corrupt to the core.
Pie in your  Aye.
Funny that he uses the exact same play book of excuses, diversion and cries of witch hunt that the other entitled, bloated, vacuous piece of hateful shit from across the pond uses. Britain's Trump Lite!
Another great slice of Pie 🥧
More pie. Please.
3:17 onwards...just says it about the man.
This isnt out of character. They knew what he was like yet still put him in charge.
Right on.
God damn I've missed you Jonathan pie! Lol, can't wait to see you live next year
Johnson if your fed up of clowns,don’t go to the circus.
Prison....prison is it prison...suspension for a job he's already quit yeah that'll make nanna's corpse happy.
I find it practically impossible to speak about that total johnson without expletives.
Love it 😂
Only if the news was as accurate at representing the truth
I got confused there for a moment if you were talking about our lying piece of shit (Trump) or your Boris! The names are definitely interchangeable!!
03:16 - the reason YouTube was invented.  Thank you Jonathan
👏👏👏👏👏
You dont like Johnson, do you?
100% CORRECT.
So, you’re not a fan then?
I think Jonathan needs to come of the fence and tell us what he really thinks as I’ve said a lot worse about Johnson
You don't have a constitution 🦅 🇺🇸🇺🇸
'Injured balloon' phahaha
Pussycats are not cowards.
Another wannabe dictator has faded away.
Ah Pie you never fail to impress. 😂
You should be on the main BBC news with this accurate account of Boris Johnson, well done Jonathon !
Fantastically visceral response. Thank you for being an avatar of the ffs folk!  Oh, and thank you for Call Jonathan Pie, BBC Sounds doesn't have a feedback spot so I'll mention it here instead. A fun premise and excellent supporting cast. 👏
And then there is Trump.
ooooh dear. you dont like that twat do you pmsl
Can one wound a balloon?
Stick him and his enablers in jail with Trump.
Why can't Boris do a Blair, or a Major or a Cameron or a May or a Truss? And just fade away with dignity?
I ❤ Jonathan
Spot on. Johnson is a coward. The committee has a Conservative majority, so members of his own party have found him guilty. The recommended sanction would then have gone to Parliament for all MPs to vote on freely, so he clearly didn’t think he would even win this despite the Conservatives having a 62-seat majority. And then 10% of his electorate would have to sign the recall petition to even get to the point of triggering a by-election, which he could have contested but clearly thought he would lose. He’s a a massive gaslighting,Trumpian, conspiracy pedalling bell end.
Will all the Boris backers pay to put right anyone who got fined or jailed for similar or less serious actions during the same time?
Jonathan Pie is a national treasure. The only question is which nation.
Pie hilariously putting into words exactly how every right minded person in the UK is feeling right now. Bravo!
I am disappointed that Jonathan took it too easy on Boris.
Johnny pie cakes is back
I’m afraid 😧 that I have come to the conclusion that the bozmiester is a liar 🤥
Well said - what he's done to the integrity of our government, the type of people who followed him in, the drag net of Brexit we have to deal with, the fall in our stock in global perception. The man was never fit for office and like any good charlatan and would be tyrant he exploited people's hate and fear, and once in he's delivered nothing and done harm that will last the rest of my lifetime. The man is scum and I do not say it lightly.
Disappointing. Evan Jonathan Pie has gone soft on Boris.
I think you summed that up pretty well. You forgot a party or two with KGB spies.
I think Jonathan has caught the feeling of the nation quite nicely.  As ever.
Love this guy
...... and Yet, Boris Johnson will likely make a comeback into British politics in a year and a half or so, because the Tory Party, and by extension, the British voting public will choose to overlook his trespasses for some sort of .... expedience (something like "Boris is at least entertaining, isn't he?"). Just watch.
😂😂😂 110% accurate and nobody else can say it like Jonathan pie does… brilliant well said man x
“Running off like a wounded balloon “ 😂
I hate to say it , but this is subpar please focus & elaborate better ... use different words & dont repeat
A wounded balloon 🎈🤣🤣👍
Betcha the morons in your electorate will welcome him with open arms. Speaking as a colonist from Canada.
I’ve known he was a liar since he tried to cover up threatening to beat up another journalist. What’s changed again?
This.
You are a complete wordsmith. Wish I had your tallent for stringing sentences together. Keep up the wonderful work of telling it like is!!🤣🤣
Love Boris, the epitome of a puppet that entertained with his charismatic demeanour. No one in office has ever been fit for it, just exploit the steeple.
that is how it is when you are a congenital liar and buffoon.
Love your videos but please don't have a heart attack whilst doing them. Talk about putting your heart and soul into them.Keep doing them my dear but remember your blood pressure. 😃xx.
That a pretty detailed and fair assessment and the conclusion was to the point. 😂 although you might get complaints from Cu*ts who don’t want to be tarred with the same brush 😂
Pure genius
Just brilliant sums him up what else has he done Finnish him
Love that comment that he looks like a boiled sweet in a Hoover bag 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When your role models are Just William and Violett Elizabeth what could possibly go wrong.
as a German, its nice to learn new words, they never taught me in school!
Tad unfair on pigs, other than that, nicely done.
New Pie rant day is always a good day
Finally proper reporting. Love u Jonathan!
It's not "one or the other", meaning lying or thick; it's one, or the other, or both!
He’s so Trumpian. A whiny, self-pitying, over privileged man baby in a badly fitting suit.
Well said
Fantastic!!!!!
Still. Boris was quite funny, for a while.
Imagine - If it wasn't for Bojo's sea-deep narcissism, with empathy as bright as a black hole, he'd have humbly apologised right from the start to 'unintentionally' misleading the house, have begged forgivenesss from the public and in all likelyhood still be PM.
Bully is a key element
The most accurate term for Johnson is 'psychopath', which also applies to all our current crop of cabinet ministers. This is what the general public need to wake up to.
He committed perjury under oath to a parliamentary committee which is a criminal offence  The CPS must investigate this and charge him with perjury which carries a custodial sentence
Mr Pie's videos are a much needed consolation during this nightmare.   Thank you
The entire Tory Party are as guilty as the lying, dangerous and immoral DumBo and should be eradicated from history like the Nazi Party.
Say it how it is.
We should put Jonathan Pie as honourary opposition leader for a few PMQ's. I would pay a lot of money to see him disassemble the PM and his cronies
Ya got me, with the "Lying Tory" comment, although you used the alternative name for 'Tory' which has the same number of letters but begins with 'C' and is also quite often the word which follows the words 'lying' and 'Tory'  When those words came out it was like I had been waiting for them, I gave an involuntary cheer.
There are no words....but I'll take yours. With knobs on 😂
Pie for pm!
On fire and hit the nail right on the head as always
If James O'brien was allowed to say this live, we'd probably hear it everyday
We won't see any justice. He'll get a little slap on the wrist, thing they was going to do with a 90 days suspension ( big deal, he would have gone on holidays) , and he will be off to his next very well paid job like nothing happen.
Welcome 😅
The VERY FIRST time I saw J. Pie I actually thought he was a " real " news person !!! And I was Shocked . Where was that stiif upper lip. To be fair.... I also thought Blair With was real...had NO IDEA what the HECK "found footage " was. Fangs fur sharing
YES! Jonathan Pie always makes me laugh by saying exactly what any person with a functioning brain is actually thinking.
I expect Boorish Johnnyson to produce a comic soon, entitled, "Why I am still Prime Minister and you're not".
As per Boris, I always find myself thinking--Wait. Is it Boris or Trump? So confusing sometimes. BUT! So very satisfying!
Divide and Conquer
You have been sorely missed!
Boris is an FLC . 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When i feel so angry and so disillusioned.  I just watch you. You say everything i am feeling and you make me howl with laughter. You are completely brilliant xxx thankyou for speaking my mind.
Jonathan, why are you sitting on the fence on this? I think you should say what you think!
As ever ✌️😎🇺🇸☎️🇬🇧
You’ve said it all! 😁
Yes. Well fucking said.
The Pie rant I waited for years for.
Johnson is now officially a liar. Thangam Debbonaire went on record calling him a liar numerous times in the House and she wasn't challenged by the deputy speaker.
Can really tell you don't like Boris 🤣🤣
Goofy bird on her way out
" a boiled sweet in a hoover bag" glad i wasnt taking a drink at that point it would have been a mess.
Jail the bastard
cleck cleck BOOM!
I honestly believe that there is a possibility that boris is trump's lost twin brother...i mean...the hair...the intelligence...the thickness...plus he is bornnin the US...in queens new york!
No, sunshine.  This is about people in Parliament criminalising the public and not applying the rules to themselves.
A tad understated in the circumstances I'd say. 😂😂
America needs it's own Jonathan Pie.  At least Britain is on the road to recovery (or at minimum realizing they have a problem)
Don't sugar coat it, tell us exactly what kind of a person he is. ☺
Bee You Tee Foooool
Tell us what you really think, Jon. Great video as ever.
From minor crook on Heartbeat to legendary voice of the proletariat and generally anyone who isn’t a well off Tory supporter that has their head screwed on properly!!
Oh I love my slice of pie
Yes. Just yes.
Pie, you … are … AMAZING!   My hat’s off to you.
I can feel him spitting on my face
You speak for the nation, well except for the cuntservatives.
How is he any different to the rest of the Westminster cesspit? Blair lied over Iraq and migration. Major lied over family values. Heath lied about the direction of the common market. Last week Starmer was cancelling all new exploration in the North sea, this week he isn't. He even pretends he doesn't know what a woman is. The civil service is lying about protecting our borders......the whole swamp needs clearing!
Now I'm not very clever, but when I first saw Alexander Boris Deffefil on hignify all those years ago, I saw a total tw@t that shouldn't have been put in charge of a wheelbarrow.  Not often I'm right, but I wish I'd been wrong!😢
I don't know if you get asked or not, but can you sell that T-Shirt somewhere? I'd really like one so I can fight this government with added panache
HERO as always! 👏
Oh replace Boris with Donald, no loss of truth there.
so yall had a sack of sh!t as a leader too huh? ours is getting flushed at the moment
If you cannot think of any words to express the joy of Bojo, “fat-lad” Johnson finally being held to account, don’t worry! Pie will have some 🎉😂
Absolute liar,conman and a grifter just like Trump.
🔥🔥🔥
Jonathan Pie speaks more truth in one video than Johnson ever has in his whole life
Agree 💯  x 💯  ofc... (Not language choices tho - but I get reasons lol)
Running off like a wounded balloon 🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant
I do not find Floppy Johnson likeable, credible or on any way noble. I also dislike his brand of politics. However... Those who love him, love him.  And they will never change their view.   This was another glorious piece from Monsieur Pie. Chapeau!
Don’t listen to his words, just say lies-lies-lies in your head while his mouth is moving. Trust me, you will be better off.
Hasn't "Jonathan Pie", the boy actor in provincial tv series Heartbeat, done good.
Mr Pie, I like you. Your video about Trump winning and how the left has become intellectually flabby and refuses to debate and just uses their social power to cast out anyone who opposes them thus sowing the seeds of their own cultural backlash, is brilliant and on point. But Boris Johnson is old news. He'll never be in power again. He had a chance years ago and he blew it. The "right wing" has no love for him because he delivered a terrible EU deal and he instigated lockdowns and he didn't 'conserve' anything, he didn't bring immigration under control he didn't change hate speech laws, he didn't help the economy, nothing.  The left hates him because duh.  It has been 3 months since your last upload and so much has happened in the UK since then. Boris is irrelevant, he'll never come back to power.
Pie for pm
“Harsh penalty”?  Nah. If he hadn’t quit he’d have a few months off (still collecting his PM allowance) and come back when he felt like it.   Can’t think of many organisations I’ve worked for/with that wouldn’t have dismissed me if I had repeatedly lied to them, undermined them and insulted, and then done the same at a disciplinary hearing.   Politics is detached from the real world.
Beating up a journalist....islamophobic, antisemitic, anti-Buddhist, anti-Sikh,  racist, sexist, homophobic, liar, gaslighter, domestic abuser (allegedly), and bully who tried to intimidate MPs and the current PM. He and Brexit and the Tories have ruined Britian...with the help of the DUP. Also a criminal....fines etc. Also lined his, his mates and his families pockets with tax payers money as London mayor, MP and PM. And then appointed peerages and honours to similar scum, some of whom broke covid laws and lied.
Wounded balloon …absolute class😂😂😂
Jeeeez Jonathan, get off the fence!
Love it 🥰
2:27 delilvery of this line is spot on
love the foie gras shit image that I still have..thanks Mr Pie..didnt know where you were going there..was expecting jiz, but that would be asparagus wouldnt it?
Very good as usual but he's got it badly wrong about Putin and the war in Ukraine. He might as well be MSM the way he accepts the NATO/US/UK/EU narrative.
An absolute masterpiece. Now if someone in America would create an oratory even 1/2 as good about Trump
I wish this bloke would quit it with the mealy mouthed beating around the bush song and dance and just get on with telling us what's on his mind.
I would love a world without Pie meaning we have functional governance, but at least Pie helps get me through this hellscape
Nadine Doris will not want to see this...
Absolutely!
Finally it's official ... He lied to the whole country ... yes, that's you, me and everyone we know!!! Defend that if you can!
A golden epoch on the journey of Jonathan Pie. Brilliant😁
Any spare towers Lying Idle???  {\} ))
hope Boris gets an indictment ...
The truth will out. After being an also ran for months on end, Boris is a has been. He ought be be summarily ignored by one and all. They think he might shine with Tice and Farage. How wrong can these worth folk be?
And yet. He was probably the best that parliament could offer.. We're fkn doomed.
Great rant, JP.
No offence was committed. They just made us believe that we would be committing  an offence if we carried on as normal.
Haha!  That ending. Brilliant 👏
👏👏👏👏👏 Very this 👍💯😂
But how do you really feel about Boris?
I think they made me eat toast 4 a reason.. A sign of the universe.. In ni t..
These 3:45 have been YEARS in the making. Jonathan Pie at his absolute best.
But how do you REALLY feel?  This applies to Trump over here in the US. I wish his MAGA followers would have to listen to this but they don't let any information into their tiny little brains that is MAGA approved.  Looks like these types of "leaders" are flourishing all over the planet and it's scary!
And yet theres still an army of gammons out there who see their own malignant narcissism and hatred in him regardless of the fact that he's 100x richer than they will ever be and that he has been manipulating (lying to) them from the start. They would still and I quote "vote for him tomorrow." if they could. Good old blighty!
Tell us how you really feel ;)
More please Johnathan!!  Spot on as usual...
This sounds like the indictment of Trump
😂😂😂 '... looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag' — 'a wounded balloon'
Man. What are you going to do when Labour are in power and everything gets way worse? You're going to be out of a job!! (Unless you pull a Jon Stewart and just start bitching about GB News and stuff that powerless conservative MPs say)
A boiled sweet 🍬 in a hoover bag 😂
If Boris is that thick, he has no place in public life, even if he is just a liar. 🫨
The life and career of Boris Johnson summed up perfectly.
So sad Pie can’t get as angry about the unscientific lockdown experiment
Jesus. Say what you mean FFS.
OH! Jonathan, I love the true words that you say. Boris is a 100% example of money being given to the wrong person.
'Bout right. R.
Without the accent and 'parliament' I would have thought you were talking about Trump.
Yep, Johnson is a lying c**t.
Ahhh, you know its a good day when you get that notification inviting you for another slice of Pie...and what better way to sum up the immensley stupid honey monster, with a big capital C 🤬👌🥮🇬🇧💪
welcome back
Now tell us how you really feel!  😂.
Trump & Johnson are TWO of a kind! BOTH are LIARS, RACIST, SEXIST NARCISSISTIC BULLIES & WANNABE DICTATORS....
Johnson has no apparent ethical capacity.  Compared to that, being a liar is a fairly bland accusation.  He will resort to any tactic to protect himself and advance his ambitions, damage anyone and anything.
Whole country went behind him into a brexit chaos. Why not rejoin ? Why not stop this madness ?
LOL LOL LOL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!!!!
His lips were moving, of course he was lying.
''A boiled sweet in a hoover bag'' 🤣
UK continues down the sewer pipes
Pie drops a big fat "C" bomb!! , one approves sir🤣🤣👍
Not sure if cunt is the right word for BJ. Do we need something stronger?
He's a spineless, self-serving, lying bigot, but he's definitely not thick.  This belief he seems to have that he can get away with anything is actually fairly understandable because, up until now at least, he pretty much has done.
😂😂😂
Hear, hear.
Damn, sounded like he was about to take off - before being cut off😂. Tbf, nothing about Johnson is shocking or new, he's been the same for the last 25yrs.
Oh hey, he remembered his YouTube password! ;)
Agreed!!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Thank you Jonathan...beautifully put.
superb!!!🤣🤣🤣
Pie spot on.. as always. however bad boris was. . i have to argue, boris came out as per boris kinda expected.... tony blair however, or that other useless and horrific personal data giveaway bit*h, theresa may (spits)...were far, far, far worse. Theresa may signed that everybody but politicians, are suscepibtible to investigation of any nature using any means......EXCLUDING politicians. and especially former prime ministers. i dont let it consume me, but in context, some cn*ts are idiots (boris), and some truely are the DEVILS incarnate. and this woke nation lets them continue incase of offending somebody.. ffs 😡🤬😠
Aahhh - yeah that's it....right there......mmmmm.....thank you Mr. Pie
And now here's Susan with the weather....
Boris is getting it from all sides today. It is crazy the heights he reached while being a prodigious liar, but also a bald-faced liar. Now he is being pilloried for being what he is and what everyone knew he was all along.
I’m getting the impression you don’t like Boris…😂
He reminds me of that tub of lard in the US !! lOL
Brilliant
Thank you so much Jonathan, I'm glad you cleared up that point so well.
It might be just my impression, Jonathan does not like Boris.
he really didn't do anything wrong.  other than the lying.
if only I could "Call Jonathan Pie" on a radio phone in show to voice my displeasure...
3:16 on repeat LOL :D
Well... You know... Why don't you tell us how it really is? 😂
Probably want to bleep out calling Boris the "C" word, 'cuz The Algorithm will surely demonetize and shadow ban you.
I think you were overly generous and charitable about Boris to be honest...
But his new house has a MAHOOSIVE fridge he can hide in for a while..........
Interesting name PIE... Head of this Kangaroo court one Harriet Harmen who back in the 1970s was on the committee of P.I.E the Peadophile Information Exchange who campaigned to lower the age of consent to 10...Starmer, he who apparently when head of the CPS saw no evil, heard, no evil, said no evil and Jimmy Saville wasn't prosecuted..Dont kid yourselves Johnsons the only one out of 650 and the tens of thousands who have been in that place...the whole stinking lib,lab,CON are exactly the same.
"A boiled sweet in a hoover bag" Bravo sir 👏
"Just fucking nonsense"   Bojo in politics, defined in three words. 🥧👍
Always love to hear the truth from Jonathan Pie. Nobody else has the balls big enough to say it but this man does every time! 👍
Wow. You had Boris, we had/have Trump. Two of the biggest clusterfucks to ever have hit the political stage. Everything said applies x10.
On the bright side, at least he's not going to further copy his countryman and role-model The Don and embark on a years-long tour of the nation, repeating the same proven lies to his gaslit zombie followers over and over, and whining about how mistreated he is... At least he wouldn't do that ... would he?
Yesss!
Next time, don't hold back 👍
I've been looking forward to this video. Naturally you haven't disappointed.
Huzzah for skewering Bozo, the Eaton wanker.
I laughed so much at this indictment of what Johnson clearly is. In China, he’d have been dealt with more harshly because we are soft and decent, which cu… sorry, creatures,  like BJ exploit . The elite have been laughing at all of us. Time for change. They won’t go quietly, though. They might need some encouragement. Legally of course.
nice greenery, mr. Pie
This guy is in a league of his own. Every video is just perfection, the podcast is sheer genius.....
I don't know if I'll ever be able to get the image of Boris Johnson spraying "foie-gras-infused liquid shit" out of my head. Thank you for that, Jonathan.
Off the scale funny and accurate 😂
..Hahahahaha ..." boiled sweet in a hoover bag" ... 😜
Boris and trump are vile disgusting schmucks and thank you Johnathan for telling it like it is
Brilliant. As usual.
Boris in a Nutshell or a Boiled sweet in a hoover bag.
Ideal for a job at the bbc.
Back with a bang huh. Every country needs a pie
This is exactly what the press should have been saying today.  Still heard loads people defending him 🤔 still.
finished your podcast. Waiting for season 2
Right on, Mr. Pie.
Can you please come to the USA and help us with our lying c. U.n. t.
Legendary 😁
Thank you, that was as brilliant as ever. Your acerbic wit is on fire today
Well put!
Now this bloke likes Boris Johnson you can tell lol
👍
#woundedballoon 👏👏👍
A much more exact truth is always to be had from a non-monetised channel.  I'm hungry for more Pie....!
😂🤣 👍👍
Will you come to Belfast?
I accept that driving at 150mph on the M4 is unlawful but I dont see how I committed an offence. What? Johnson was never fit to be anywhere near public office.
Why don't you just say what you mean? Isn't it nice to be able to say,  without fear of being sued,  that JOHNSON IS A LIAR And,  with his incompetent handling of the pandemic has probably killed more people than the blitz. Lock him up Now I'm going to listen to that again
I'm really enjoying his series on BBC Sounds. Got me laughing in public a few times
Bravo Mr Pie
Sounds like he has a lot common with the dumpster fire named Trump.
He’s good to his dog though.
Wow. That's some scorched earth.
So well said!
Why don't you tell us what you really think?
the tories should be disolved as a party and it should be illegal to accept donations, thats litterally buying power
The world has missed you and these- ahem, reports.😁😁😁
Magnificent rant!!  I may learn this verbatim and preach it loud to the good folk of Leigh On Sea the brainless twatters!!
Hahahahahahaha so good
Brilliant as always
You can always rely on Jonathan Pie to sum it up honestly and succinctly. Bravo! 👏
You have summed the life of this corrupt and incompetent man perfectly in 3 minutes. Thank you!
The really good thing about this is that he can be called out any which way you like and there is not a single thing the blob can do about it. I have just read that his new neighbours are flying the Euro flag and have made him and his missis unwelcome. There you go Boris - you lying twat. Reap as you sow.
So true.. well said 👍
Crab
'Foie gras infused liquid shit' done for me. I have a couple of broken ribs presently and that fuckin hurt but was worth the pain. I near pissed my pants but managed it with wincing a lot and forgetting my bladder for the few seconds it took me to get to the loo. FTT's!'
Blackford was right!
Absolute liar and bully. Let’s hope he curls up and disappears into the cesspit of his own doing… for now!
😂😂😂😂 love this 😂😂😂😂 Johnson lying again 😱😱😱 A man that can’t even be bothered to drag a comb through his hair should not be trusted. Plus the way he looks at official gatherings make the countries he represents just look unprofessional and unprepared. He is a national embarrassment, he looks like a scarecrow - a lying, disheveled, plump, horrible little toad of a scarecrow
Exposing the snivelling, spineless British media as ever JP. Both the Beeb and Sky devoting more time to the liar’s response and to those who even now want to equivocate and offer lame, sycophantic excuses on his behalf or in true Trump cult fashion, pretend he is the victim. Embarrassing
Correct, he is a liar and a national embarrassment
About time, Pie!
Jonathan Pie speaking the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth (unlike Boris Johnson).
Well said.
Like a wounded balloon.
Pie makes me laugh..... but his obsession with Boris and trump cracks me up even more!😂😂
get this man on bbc breakfast
So are people finally ready to admit that Corbyn would have been a better choice?
And Rishi's too weak to dish out further punishment.
Him and Trump. Same same.
This should be played on a loop for anyone who still thinks he's a bit of a character/got brexit done/saved Ukraine/rolled out the vaccine and built 40 hospitals! (Especially 3:18)
Johnson should be in prison for wrecking the country.
You must be torn Tom, Trump gets back in, four years of material writes its self, the upside. Down side Trump is president
Magnificent Tom, magnificent.
Wow, best one yet 😂
God! That was good.
His punishment was harsh?! Sorry, how? It's taken a year of taxpayers' money to conclude that Johnson is a lower than vermin lying narcissist, when we all knew that from the beginning; and his legal defence has been funded by the taxpayer to the tune of a quarter of a million. Where's the punishment in that? He should be locked up and the keys thrown away
Another victim of the Bent Bananas Conspiracy.
Is terrifying how two of the most powerful nations in the world trusted two compulsive liars as their leaders. It makes you think that we are in the edge of being ruled for some autocrat any time soon
You missed out "egotistical narcissist", but still a splendid summary of the lying buffoon's time in office 👏
I bet Carrie still loves him...
If Starmer had 1% of your balls, Mr P. The Tories would be out for decades. Come on Sir K. There's almost too much ammunition for you!
Could not have put it better myself. 💯👏
Concise destruction of blubbery erg rent boy who has no Intrinsic value to people.
Thank you for putting into words how many of us feel about this cretinous fuckpig, you're a good man Johnathan!
Long live Jonathan Pie
Want to save the world, Mr. Pie?  Please turn your attention now to Donald J. Trump and let us know how your really feel about the bloke.
Thank you for swearing where others no longer have the words.
I felt you held back a bit Mr pie , absolutely brilliant 👍✌️
Thank you so much Jonathan....that was brilliant!!!....I got double the pleasure of listening to you because the second time I listened, every time you said "Boris", I substituted "Donald"...non-stop frissons of delight!!!!
GAS LIGHTING BAG OF GAS....A WOUNDED BALLOON.....This pure Gold..
It's ok to be thrown under a bus by Johnson,  he makes those busses out of used wine boxes.
Perfect 😊😊😊
left black eye club hey?...interesting
I've been keeping an eye out for JPs take this! He says all the things I can't put into words.
PIG IN A HAY BALE..... ..SUPERB!!
back on the street? So the radio gig is over? 😉
Why do people keep saying Jonathan Pie is a comedian when he is in fact the BBC's leading political analyst?
think that might be a Jay at 3:23
"A lying fucking cunt". The best summary, and the best way to bring it to the people care of Mr Pie. Voted into leadership by the party members, but thrown out (if he hadn't jumped) by the elected MPs. Highlights a serious problem with the non-democratic system.
Wonderful, Mr Pie.  just wonderful.
Jumped before he was pushed, reminds me of the Scottish first liar, sorry, minister.
Brilliant. The man is a disgrace. Well said 👏
Christ I miss Pie. NEVER fails to deliver.  Re Boris, don't blame him for anything, he is what he is, a kuuntt, the blame lies with every single Individual that has either supported him, voted for him and been behind him. Shows how many weak and tasteless individuals make up the masses, which does not bode well for this country and its future....
Bob on
Who mentored whom.  Trump to Johnson or vice versa.
90 days is equal to 2 Liz Truss stints as PM.
Pie may have forgotten that Boris had only put up a mirror in front of the British public.
Waited for this.
Perfect!
I've been saying all along that he *ACTS* the clown to win favour and disguise how repulsive he truly is. Noone would listen to me years ago 🤷‍♀️
Enjoyed the new podcast this week Tom. But this is the JP rants Ive missed and needed back in my veins.
Unlawful is different to illegal.
Great stuff! Who needs popcorn when you've got Pie.
When will we get the uncensored version?  Maybe tell us what you really think ;)
Oh you beauty
precisely my thoughts
I’d still vote for brexit 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's amazing that you could replace "Boris" with "Donald" and it's still (almost perfectly) true
That ending is superb!!!
The Pie, spitting fire and truths
That final description of Boris has absolutely made my day. I thank you so much.
"a boiled sweet in a hoover sack" 🤤
When are we getting rid of rishi sunak 🤣
I'll never understand why British political comedy shows pull punches when they are being shown up by fucking youtubers
YES.
Welcome back!!!!!
His name is Johnson.
Of course Boris is a liar, he’s a Tory politician, we knew this when we voted for him.  Wait, did we vote for him or was he another Tory reboot after they totally effed up again? I get hazy after Theresa May tbh…
3.5k views in 9 minutes! Fkinell Pie, we've all been missing you.
well said
Brilliant. Just, brilliant.
nice
JP on the ball again
I want Jonathan Pie to be the news anchor in a videogame, and then if in-game you get past the ad breaks, you get to find out what Mr. Pie really thinks! XD
Brilliant Jonathan, maybe now those who still thought "Boris is a good bloke" realise he is our own "Trump Light", a corrupt, lying, bully.
Brilliant, you are a star 🎉
He didnt lie about brexit
Naughty lying little boy.
HIS FATHER  GAVE  HIM  SECRET  WANKS    WHEN HE WAS  10
A British politician who lies, name one that chuffing doesn't. Biggest bunch of crooks going!  Honestly this country won't be even close to what's it's capable of until it's run by those with actual moral standards, who happen to be in touch with reality....
Amen
I believe that henceforth, it is only fitting that the pejorative, vernacular nomenclature for the female genitalia, should in actual fact be called a 'Boris'.  You've made a right Boris of that. Look at that total Boris cutting everyone up in the Audi. That Rees-Mogg is a massive Boris.  It just works.
The BEST most Honest Journalist/Satirist Ever! Jonathan Pie We Salute You!
I needed this.
Please, don’t hold back!
Tell it like it is. Like we all knew it. Except for the Fatberg of gibbering Pus that is Boris The Liar !!
Brexit happened.  It's over my guy.  Time to move forward so you can understand how blessed you are not to be ruled by other nations.
Brilliant
I'd say he's a bigger liar then thick but then he's pretty fucking thick........
Saying precisely what we're thinking, as usual. Thank you.
a perfect analysis
I've been waiting _years_ to hear Jonathan go off on Johnson like this!  Thank you.
Such a pity the inestimable Pie was not consumed by more before Brexit. As for his evaluation of Bojo, glorious.
Did your little pedo pals at the BBC pay you to say this? You left any integrity you had at the door Tom.
"Foie Gras infused shit" I now have to find an opportunity to use this insult, pure genius!
boris trump
I have correct you. A Cunt is a thing of great beauty and the desire of 1/2 of human kind! This is not a description that could ever be applied to the narcissistic self aggrandising superannuated Eton Toddler.
I remember you! Good BBC podcast btw, but I need more. MORE!
Well Pie the Police didn't think it was unlawful, but the committee did, vindictive Nasty F**kers, this is a witch - hunt, Sue Grey, and Harriot stiched him up. Bullshitt* Every word.
Are we talking about Trump or Johnson?  I get them so confused sometimes.
How I have missed these rants 🤣
narcissists can say sorry.. fat little piggy is a crook
Well said that man!! lol
Trump   Boris    Morrison     all the same ......
The more jonathan gets angry the more i wee myself so funny
Like any old bully, he could dish it out. But he couldn’t take it in the end. Bully, bully!
The best rants are definitely British.  🇬🇧
it says so much about English people, boris the man who on behalf of NATO and associated partners destroyed peace talks in UKr, implemented Lockdowns on behalf of big pharma, suspended parliament unjustly and many other wrongdoings, all are ignored but go to a party and you are toast.
That was cathartic. Thank you!
Just... perfect!
He also didn't receive repeated reassurance it was OK to dip his winky in his secretary.
I can't stand Trump. Sorry, Boris. I always get those two liars mixed up.
I love Boris- he really is the funniest guy in British politics- much funnier than all the other clowns.
Thank you telling it ALL like it is ! Excellent !
John saying pussy like that funny as fuck
I couldn’t wait for JP’s take on this.  Perfect.
Wage stagnation in the UK is only comparable to the wage stagnation that occured during the Napoleonic War! Lucky they got all the big calls right or where would we be...
Sums him up completely.  He's and entitled, dimwitted, self serving shit.  He should be in prison.
😂"only just a bit thick. Hardly fxxking news" 😂😂😂😂😂
Absolutely Brilliant
You got Liz Truss for 45 days…happy?
Let’s face it, Boris is a bit of a scumbag. We don’t even official know how many kids he has since he can’t keep it in his trousers.
Just heard that the wage stagnation in the UK is only comparable to the wage stagnation that occured during the Napoleonic War! As James O'brien said lucky they got all the big calls right or where would we be
Spot on as always!
What a huge waste of time boris has been
....wait, are we talking about Boris, or Trump?  Missed you, Jon!
I committed murder but I’m not entirely sure who I killed
And as always with the wealthy they fail upwards
Don’t be surprised if Bullshit Boris bobs back, like an I unflushable turd that just won’t disappear.
"A gaslighting bag of gas." Solid 👌
Goddamn it Colin, you interrupted his rant! 😂
I might be imagining things, but I think Johnathan doesn't care too much for ole Boris.
I was hoping a video was incoming and it didn't disappoint! :-)
Fabulous 🤩
Boris is a narcissistic buffoon…always has been…🤬🤬🤬  Sir, can you do a piece on Trump indictment and how he listened to Fitton instead of his own lawyers…?  😂😂😂
Please don't be shy,  Jonathan.  You are among friends. DON'T HOLD BACK 😂😅🤣
Thank god the lying piece of crap is gone.
Anyone would think you don’t like Boris Johnson!
Brilliant as always
This was surprisingly calm at the start, but it certainly built up the expected head of steam as it went on.
OMG! 😂😂
Another one claiming it's a witch hunt. Has anyone checked to see if he is a witch?
And yet, there are still people who think he's somehow a victim!
Definition of tory is an economically and politically illiterate, lazy, liar.
Masterpiece
Boris is a version of Trump, or vice-versa. Boris doesn't stand a chance of acquiring the Prime ministership, but unfortunately, Trump does.
Boris Johnson is as repulsive as a sewage bathhouse and just as dirty.
“Boiled sweet in a hoover bag” 😂  I really wish Johnson had had to face Pie rather than the sycophantic media he always spoke to.
BIG   LIER   !!!     BREXIT   ZERO  BENEFITS  !!!!!
Nice one 👍
get over yourself
He's The Terminal-lier-nator.... he'll be back.
"...who looks like a boiled sweet in a hoover bag" - just amazing.
90 suspension was not long enough or the right kind of punishment
Sometimes I'm pleased the country is going to hell, because at least we get Pie out of it
I'm sure he'll be back though. The Boris Comeback Party, bubbly for all... fucksake
Poor Jonathan is going to have stroke at this rate. And so do I. I cant stand the fact that this disgustng liar is a succesful politician.
Brilliant say no more
Don't hold back, Jonathan. Do tell us what you really think.  😉😅
Brilliant as usual, Tim, I don't need to watch the video before saying that ❤
👍💞😂
Bozo commits an offence by simply existing.
Thick does not excuse lies.
Just binging on the podcast just now... Can't recommend it enough, so sign up people, so do yerself a favah... 😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👍
Did you know wage stagnation in the UK is only comparable to the wage stagnation that occured during the Napoleonic War!
Toodle-pip, old boy!
I am so looking forward to seeing you Tom!!! ❤
There are no words sufficient for this morally bankrupt individual
been waiting for this one 😂
Nadine still getting her peerage 🤣🤣
😅
I knew this would bring the YouTube channel some life again.
Ahh heres my angry dopamine fix for the day
boris bashing... it's almost nostalgic
Brilliant as always!!!
Pie is back I am happy
Pie
🤣
