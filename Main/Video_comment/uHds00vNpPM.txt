When you realise this video was released on Thursday Feb 24, 2022
Russia attacked on Feb 24, 2022 but this video was uploaded on Feb 23, 2022... youtube glitch?

This war is karma for NATO, for every time they attack and destroy other countries, always together. Now they can no longer face Russia together because China, Iran, North Korea, India, Indonesia are watching. If there is a major war in Europe. Countries that are peeking will immediately take action to annex the country that has become their target

With all that prior intel.................and still, the invasion.   Ownership of information is indeed a high commodity.
Crimea, Donetzk and Odessa. These are three. How does pong bounce back? This has been one long campaign since 2014.

A few times we were told by the local authorities that a hurricane was coming our way and that we had to evacuate immediately so we packed and left and later came back each time when everything was peaceful again ..... Russia could have burnt their own people all alive like USA warlords (USA is NOT the people in USA) DID many times before with people not our own...... instead Russia  waited long enough for their own people to safely evacuate ...... unfortunately deceitful warlords from demoacies afar instructed naive and dilusional for war glory clown actor Zelenskyy to use ukranians as humanshields and to repeat to Ukranians that they are innocents protected from the hated Russian Hurricane ...... the world do not want to remember the Democratic Oligarchs/warlords DECADES OLD PLAN which is: 1) to have our brothers Ukranian sons and Russian sons kll each other without taking any blame for it (achieved)........ 2) their gold rush goal to own their gas oil wheat once Russia is destroyed and converted to Democratic states, but the main goal is the 6,000 nukes because with this Chinese brothers and sisters are next  (not achieved yet).........  3) to break Russia with a long war selling arms to Ukranians without NATO getting involved (achieved) .......4) To turn the world of intelligent individuals along Ukranians into mega idiots only with videos so that no one discovers warlords inhumane plans by making the whole world cry "fight Ukraine fight" (achieved) ..... 5) to have a puppet dilusional with war glory "the defender of all Europe" President like Zelenskyy so that Ukranian sons are imposed with their deaths defending the interests of democratic warlords from afar (achieved) ...... 6) to build nuclear plants in Ukraine so that they can be exploded like Chernobyl if nothing works (partially achieved) ....... 7) to build and use a biolab in Ukraine to blame the Russians with it (achieved, see the link).... ... 8) through the years Russia expressed their safety fears and now RUSSIA has said to NATO STOP NO MORE .... sad, so sad.....  It is painfully sad ....to live the warlords from afar malicious plans for this family of Russians and Ukranians which is to kll each other when this family could together be peacefully selling gas oil energy and wheat to not only the democratic world ..... this democratic warlords gave Wuhan a Trojan Horse, we know that is a fact, now the whole world of idiots hate our chinese brothers and sisters, many in the world also hate the whole USA because of those warlords....

None of these videos allow the markings to be shown. They seem to be shot to keep the angle sharp & cut short to allow anyone to confirm markings. Seems like propaganda. WSJ is not a trusted news source.

In the end, the grilled meat named "trap" of the Russians, Ukrainians, Eu, Nato and the whole world was served on the table of the United States... because the US wanted to expand Nato was the main cause of the war.  During the war, the Americans did everything to spark the war with the face of a peace lover.... a country in uraina Ngu didn't talk... over here the whole European leadership bloc was as stupid as  cows eat grass, Europe eats all the grass, they won't be hungry  you and your family eat together for fun, even the entire world uraina protesters as well as cows, why don't you ask your leaders what to do to expand the military alliance, why don't you guys  Why don't you let your wife and children join the army to fulfill your ambitions, why do you take my children out to the battlefield, our money  pay taxes for you guys  let you guys feed me delicious or beautiful food or let you guys go to Russia to buy nuclear bombs for us to eat, you people in Europe, especially Americans, often question their leaders and governments  , stand up to protest and dismiss the term of the belligerent leader who wants to expand the Nato military bloc the most, if you don't protest, the possibility that you and your whole family will have the ability to eat nuclear bombs all over Europe  continent... and instead of protesting against NaTo's expansionist policy led by the US as the main cause of the war, they protested that war was just a consequence... sorry for saying  like this... hope that parents all over the world don't spend money on their children to go to Europe to study stupid subjects like cows anymore... hope world peace lovers share the content  This is to stop the war soon, because I know who is the real trigger of the war, Russia, they react to protect their legitimate interests, if someone puts a bomb in front of your house, points a gun,  At your house, you will react like Russia, thank you for sharing the news on the forum....

Putin's assistant Xi Jinping.. Deport Chinese from all countries. Chinese are pretending to be Koreans. Be sure to check your passport. Deport or ki
Only 40% of the 150.000 on the boarder have moved into Ukraine Russian troops are using Artillery strikes when they get contact just wipeing Ukraine troops out 😓 is only going to get worse when the rest for the troop moves in

Movie forward Russia love from India
the west always  have lies in everytime, everywhere
this is so sad. love from singapore!
now it all makes sense and this vid came out on the 23rd
I support Russia....and I respect vladimir putin....he tried to save two states who are tortured by Ukraine... this two states asked help from president Putin...
Ukraine has declared that it will create nuclear weapons. Russia responded by conducting a special operation and demilitarizing Ukraine, forcing it to peace, followed by denazification and a trial of the followers of Nazism defending the authorities of Ukraine. Now the Ukrainian authorities have distributed machine guns to the population and chaos and slandering have begun with murders and settling scores with each other. Ukraine released criminals from prisons. The Nazis do not want trial and fight hard.
Bring that energy over here Russia! I can't wait to wipe these mfers off the face of the Earth.
And the liers say they were being sent for training to Ukraine and were unaware
They have the devil in them
Shame if someone with 250 million sent 5 Rockets to the location and kill 25k Russians and 100 billion Euros of Military equipment 🤷‍♂️

Funny how everyone so concerned about Russian invading killing civilians when America England and Israel killing civilians for fun
America, Nato hit Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Kosovo... no one spoke up. Russia beat Ukraine because it was worried about Nato's threat, so why are so many people protesting. If the US and Nato keep supplying Ukraine with weapons and economic sanctions, then Russia will be cornered. At that time, Russia no longer has an economy, before starving Russia will play with all hands, "I die, you also die". Russia will play with real nuclear weapons, life is too unfair. Forcing Russia to the end is a terrible mistake that the US and the West do not take into account, still busy with joy in weakening Russia because of the sanctions. But I don't know that I'm joking with a superpower about nuclear weapons.

WWII & NOW ?? As war is fought it takes charge And events spin out of control. The madness of men can alter the soil which nourishes the roots of their soul.  Many things will forever change Far more then wished to be. As the wrath of war starts to destroy Those things we fight to keep free.  War is the greatest plague of man, Religion, state and sanity. Any scourge is more preferred Than the one which disables humanity.  When war breaks out, boundaries change And all who die are a token Of the rage that must run its course Before words of peace are spoken.  It’s not a priest that gives us our freedom of religion And it’s not a reporter that gives us our freedom of voice. It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, preacher or teacher But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.

It’s sad, I see Russia getting exactly what they want, Ukraine. The US and other countries will just let it happen, spouting how they’ve sanctioned Russia heavily. Clearly sanctions do not deter or scare Russia from this invasion. It’s time to either stop and watch, or take action to truly help.
Trump been crying to Putin again life so unfair to him.  The POS only know how to bomb civilians and Trump should face death penalty for being a traitor.
How long did it take the USA to  take  Iraq? answer-26 days -6000 dead soldiers How long  did take the USA to take Afghanistan? 3-4 months - 5000 dead soldiers 700 000 dead civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan 4500000 dead  the Vietnamese 4500000 dead Koreans 20-30 000000 dead  Indians Native Americans 30000 spanish soldiers  - spanish-american war  500000 dead mexican soldiers  - mexican-american war  Ukrainians  are taking  pleasure in killing and filming dead   and wounded Russian soldiers. It is unmoral,sick and ugly This is my only private opinion  I'm afraid, that Putin will use mini nukes , armed miniatured  aircrafts , cluster weapon, napalm bomb or  poisonous gas namely sarin or gas   contained carfentanil and opioid against ukrainian nationalists. Putin will  treat ukrainian nationalists like terrorists  and  He can use the gas or nuclear bomb.This guy is determined. It will be the instant bombing .He will turn  ukrainian towns into sea of ruins. Gaza militians  and Palestinians hided  rockets and   artillery and weapon in civil buildings.Israel destroyed /bombed them. Putin said, than Ukrainians installed   heavy artilllery between the buildings.Putin slept the chance  away  between 2015-2021 ( militarisation of Ukraine) .Putin grew rich , building big palace. Attack  on Kiev is mistake.He would win after conquering/taking control of  western  Ukrainian border and South Ukraine. Russia will conquer third of Ukraine or  Half of Ukraine and Putin will be replaced.  Probably scenario Zeleski will escape 60 %  of Ukrainians  will lay down the arms. China will send tansk and artillery to Russia Negative scenario for China Vietnam, Taiwan, Philipines, Japan, India,  Kyrgyzstan,Kirgistan,Tadzykistan,Mongolia ,Uzbekistan will join NATO between 2030 and 2045 endangered, encircled,surrounded China China vs NATO  WW III, nuclear war Russia will be asian country .Russia  and China,Kazakhstan,Uzbekistan, Mongolia, North Korea will unite/join forces to create political, militar,economic  federation.Russia needs great army composed of  immigrants  from post-soviet countries  artificial russian-chinese  isles on the Athlantc and Pacific  russian-chineste internet  russian-chinese SWIFT  alternative russian-chinese space station and satellites
what war?  ....  LOL !!!!!!!!!
Tiktok just prove itself a threat for national security in real time.
So it's all over TikTok.  Basically meaning China and the CCP have high coverage of what's happening on the ground.
If a contry sends soldiers and tanks to another country, without an invitation... What is it called? Its simple... If its America then its liberation, and if its Russia then its invasion
ok WW3, anyway that hottie analyst Thomas Bullock is so handsome😍🤤 so cute
There is nothing we can do to stop the cruel people who run this world from spreading war destruction chaos death hate division... it's just what they do on this messed up planet. Greed power control money ego hatred..a lack of love for your fellow man...selfishness pride envy etc etc this is what causes war and needless death and suffering.  If you read the Bible you'll find out we are all born with a sin nature into this world and really all these traits are in all of us none excluded.  So no we can't change how this world is run sadly.  We can change ourselves though..our hearts minds attitudes lifestyles thoughts actions intentions.  We can choose good love kindness forgiveness compassion empathy sympathy patience self control in our daily interactions with others. We can reach out and positively impact this world one person at a time!  Focus on what you can do not on what the corrupt selfish rulers of this earth will always do and I'm not referring to just  one particular ruler who's getting all the world's attention right now.   God bless!❤
Never expect a war could still happen in 2022.
Whos here after Russia acutally did it.
It's all because was No.1 refused to accept it is probably No.4 now.
Please stop war

Propagandist media says it is all Putin's fault. Far from reality! NATO said they wont expand east and yet they did so for the past decades. Russia had been patient and Ukraine is the last straw. The one who should be blamed the most is the Ukraine President. Russia does not event want Ukraine to join Russia. All Putin asks which Nato did not even hear is for Ukraine to stay neutral. This is all about IDEALISM vs REALISM. It is good to hear to say Nato is open to anyone who can join, That is Idealism. Realism is Russia is threatened which Ukraine President failed to realize. Russia's demands are so simple and justified. For Ukraine to stay neutral, they dont even ask Ukraine to join Russia. This comedian turned president failed to even see that. He does not even think. Blood is in your hands Zelenski. Idealism is wishful thinking in this world. Realism is the way to go. NATO exists to counter Russia. Russia wanted to join Nato before but they refused. Why? because that is the only reason they exist. If Russia, joins NATO, then all the Military industries wont profit. They need to create conflict so they make money!!! That is Reality. You want to join NATO to protect yourself against Russia? But that is the very reason why you are in this situation now. It defeats the purpose! If you only decided to be independent and neutral, this wont happen. Crimea would still be part of Ukraine and no separatist regions in the east. The moment you ask your citizens to fight, is the moment you are detached from reality. You only care about what is good to say versus what will happen. If they fight, many will die. If they don't fight they live and be happy with their family. You even fail to see that. This is not a movie, its reality. Stupid Ukrainian President!

Europe and US please help us, send in troops send in military equipment and help us defend democracy and European soil. Our people fight bravely, don't leave us alone 🙏 #saveeurope #saveukraine
Chernobyl be like: Come here my bouy
I thought tiktok has only cringe content. 🤔
TikTok is your sources now huh WSJ?
Next pandemic
Just after Covid19
Now the western media is crying and calling it war. But they were totally silent when USA and NATO forces attacked on Iraq without any reason. Their blame also proved as fake.
China took some part of India, Israel attacked Palestine and now Russia over Ukraine. Bullies will do whatever they want and no one will stop them. Rules and sanctions,UN,NATO and etc  are for stoping meek countries. 😔
so what ?
🙏🙏🙏
Israel🇮🇱💀🇺🇸 ungrateful of Russia... who defeated Nazism💀💀 ...and saved the Jews from total extermination💀🇮🇱💀
Jesus Christ is coming back soon, repent and give your lives to Jesus.
The ukranian pres brought this upon to his country. Putin already warned him for a couple of times to not join NATO because that will compromise their security esp that Ukraine is the west border for Russia. He believes what NATO said and thought that they will back him up. But when the war starts, the only thing NATO provides are words. Other countries cant fully retaliate with Russia and only sanctions were provided which im sure Putin can just brush it off. Why seek brotherhood with countries that are miles away from you than the country who is literally your next door neighbor and shared same culture. Hope they can still save whatever remains.
God🙏
Youre all a bit late with this info. There has been a full scale war for 2 days now. Houndreds of deaths.   Theyre not only attacking the 2 easteren regions.
the people need to wake up stop following the elite

Mr. Putin Please stop the war...  pity the little ones... 😭
the us funded this war for 8 years now look where its at
I trust the Russians. Russia didn't abandon Syria despite US/Nato presence in Syria. US/Nata abandoned Afghanistan and now Ukraine.  Russia is the Future<3
Tik Tok image is a thousand times better than spy satellite image and it's totally free.
Racist biased media NYT WP Wall stree BBC DW news and French news etc should ask Grandpa Joe to stop provoking Russia.
Russia is the most peaceful country. For 1000 years of history, Russia has spent 489 years in the war, this is half of its history. Russians know everything about the war. It's in their genes. And for the record, Russia has never filed, only defended. Everyone came to the Russian land, Christians, Persians, Ottomans, Mangols, English, French, Poles, Lipovites, fascists and many others. How many times has Russia saved Europe? Residents of Paris and Berlin called Alexander 2, the liberator, so there was a square in Berlin, named in his honor. But fortunately no one was able to conquer Russia. And now, what is happening, Russia has been forced to do so. Ukrainian nationalists were engaged in the genocide of the Russian people on Dombasa. "WE ARE RUSSIANS, WHAT A DELIGHT" - Alexander Suvorov. By the way, this great commander conquered the lands that Stalin later gave to Ukraine, and thanks to him such a beautiful country as Switzerland appeared, but they don't teach you this in schools, so you have such a negative attitude towards Russia
Это наша русская земля мы тут без вас как нибудь разберемся. Вы сюда свой нос лучше не суйте .
Call of duty 4 modern warfare
This is the first time in human history where civilians in war are going to play a very very major role. Many Ukrainians are flooding into the dark web, discord, telegram and other social media where they can't be tracked. They can share pictures, stories, connect with other civilians, find safe spots, even relay the whereabouts of the Russian military, all through the internet. The internet is going to play a very major role here
Europe for the Nazis killing the civilian population of Donbass. survived.
this is going to be russia down fall and putins downfall just like hitler. Because lf they try and pull the same thing that hitler and the nazis pulled taking over countries America and Europe will rise against you will be stopped what needs to happen we need is mercenaries they don't have to go by Geneva convention have regular military do there things and contractors destroy all food supply to russia starving them out seems wrong but sometimes you have to bad for the greater good
As the Ukrainian army bombed and killed the population of Donbass for 8 years, so you were all blind and deaf. And as Russia began to LIBERate Ukraine from fascist power, you immediately saw and heard everything. And then you ask why all mankind hates you Americans.
This is what happens when a US President says a "small incursion " into Ukraine is acceptable when he knows Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine while he was Vice President.. this is exactly what happened in 1938 when Neville Chamberlain allowed Nazi Germany to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia & then once Hitler realized he was feared by Chamberlain & other leaders, he invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia as their allies watched & threatened sanctions.. We can only hope that this time around the implications aren't as severe.. because quite frankly I don't think Biden could light an m-80 without disastrous consequences, let alone trusting him to protect the fate of western civilization..🤔
Perhaps the most evil of war crimes.. An unprovoked war that will only hurt the innocent.. as you read this, innocent people are praying to make it through the night without dying from one of the many bomb's they can hear overhead..🇺🇸🤝🇺🇦
America should stop flexing its power over other countries. Hope rest of the countries retaliate against America's control over their own countries political economic culture privacy development and defence. Salute to Putin for standing up against Evil ideologies. Ukraine it's a back stabbing decision to join NATO, it's against Asia and Humanity. Have a bit Honor and Respect for Yourself. Drop USD as world trading currency. We're not born to serve white people.

For 8 years you pretended that there is no war in East Ukraine. For 8 years Russia tried to make peace in Donetsk and Luhansk while huge army of Ukrainian Nazis shelling those two areas with bombs and killed 14 thousands of civilians including children.
Too late
Hehe
And the fact that the world watched as he moved all his troops and equipment to the border and no one done anything about it but said do not cross this line or we will sanction you a bunch of spineless countries

Thank God Russia was more humane and restrained than the US was with Iraq, Libya and Syria. They're actually saving civilians instead of killing them by the thousands.
Какое ваше собачье дело до этого?
So, when the US does the same thing it's ok but not Russia?
how many quality shots and evidence. And when the Boeing was shot down, you didn’t have any personnel.  But as a Russian I will say ... what is happening is a terrible tragedy.
If Putin is not dealt with China will follow suit
You realize that they are likely testing 8G over 364ghz probs like 1,000ghz microwave current nostradamus forseen as fire  from the skies sabotage on innocent Ukraine. USA is not real help either. I'm telling you the darkweb whitehouse US organized crime gov and Russian mob run phishingscsms have taught these swillary, putin, obama, biden, trump, that pretend and even reinvent help stops all others from helping and allows evil to be done permanently. Also, putin is said to have bought 80,000 US Souls on darkweb by a biden whitehouse gov sale and modern white supremacist human trafficking by war will have many disappear into Russia's hands to provide him those 80,000 souls by biden an evil human trafficker of his own citizens..
God Bless Russia hope ukraine will give up so no more lives are being lost
Old news Russia invaded Ukraine because US Neo libs wanted Ukraine in NATO.  Now the USA can only offer "unprecedented sanctions".  What a weak country, as it spends more money on military than anyone else in the world yet soldiers are weak college rejects.
When the US and EU wage war and lay waste upon islamic 3rd world countries slaughtering thousand of innocents its OK good ol' uncle SAM but if Russia does it then Russia Big Bad Evil Empire, barbaric nonsense, bad Russia bad bad shame shame Russia. THE HYPOCRISY!! THE AUDACITY!!
One rule in life. Do not mess with Russians or Russia. Simple. Us in the west are to naive and dumb to realise. Don't get involved!

Russia stood by us in 1971 war. We must be silent and support Russia
Salvation is close
Russia Just wants to pop bodies and reconnect the SU, won't happen but you can't convince a Monarch
Can this war be avoided if Ukraine took a non-aligned approach ?  Wasn't zelensky  regime too much Anti russian and too much pro Western ?  Most of the decision zelensky took , he put his ego over his people's safety and now he is asking civilians to fight ?  He became too much of a tool that he now forced  Russia to a corner to  attack his country .   If he had taken a non-aligned approch to both Russia and NATO, he could have reaped benefits from both sides and made Ukrainian people better    A was with a neighbour should be the last resort  if you don't  want long term cost    He could have just said that he won't join nato and stayed non-aligned to  reap benefits for his people  from both NATO and Russia
This is why I laugh when the west what’s to reduce their military budgets. It’s living in denial that just because it’s 2022, large scale wars won’t happen. Imagine having such hubris into cutting military budgets especially European countries, while China and Russia just increase their military spending. Honestly, this is happening to the Ukraine because of weak Western European countries pretending we are in the age of peace
Čo robia americké vojska v Európe??? 👎👎👎
Putin, you do not own the world. Let ukraine choose the right place
Tiktok/sarallite images🤭😂😂🤣🤣 What do u expect form wall street journal? A propaganda machine to spread fake news. Ukraine has been attacking its own people on the east since the coup of 2014. It.ignored all Russian warning including the agreement signed on 2015.
Never in my life would I imagine TikTok and invasion as a click bait.

Am I the only one who imagines Putin riding a giant bear in front of the armored tanks looking at the horizon with binoculars in hand?
Putin is old and crazy. He will makes moves like Hitler with increasing boldness and ego. Unfortunately people do not see the potential of this and only think about how little they care about Ukraine and don't really remember Hitler and Stalin anymore
All the Ukraine shoulders have to do attack the first Russians soilders kill them and take there weapones.
Lesshhh goo russia
Looks like WSJ has more intel than the Ukranian military
Justice has prevailed, the Ukrainian authorities did not counteract the shelling and killings of residents of Donbass, the murders of those who disagree with them, who were burned in a government building in Odessa. These bullying continued for 8 years. They were terrorized constantly, shrapnel, shells exploded near schools. The West hushed it up because for him the life of a Slavic person is equal to a piece of live meat. Patience has come to an end, Russia will not allow people to be bullied
LET'S GO BRANDON!  Shalom.
Go, Russia, Go! And Belarus!!!
Z isn't in the Cyrillic alphabet it's a roman letter. Could a Russian enlighten us what it means please? We realise it's the elites and not the general public that want war you'll be fine replying??

PUTIN THE MURDER OF INNOCENT MEN  WOMEN AND CHILDREN ⚘
It happemed
massive casualties, or even in hundreds, needs to take place before america will recognize invasion beyond separatist breakaway regions that essentially were already under moscows control. ukrainian resistance will need to lift a few fingers and respond to these initial errors and deployments. when invasion occurs, we dont have lone explosions we have an array of them. we dont have a little boy killed, we have dozens of them bombed. we dont have any concerted invasion still, we have intimidation and agitation tactics which the ukranian government can respond to. if and when there are actual examples of ukrainian forces being put in disadvantage through death or violence then an alignment of european and allied support can engage, despite putins threats and warnings against 'interference'. the media who have lied countless times about wars and damage and displacement in general are not going to convince the american people to prioritize these reports until the reports can show literal invasion and destruction on a scale that ukrainian existence and allied capabilities cannot defend from. they can whine, they can lament cry and fail in all ways to use social media to force their ignorance, but will any of that solve their apparent problem ? no, no it wont.
Immigration reform PROTEST in the USA!Every Wednesday for all immigrants in the USA !Refus to work,Don't shop,Don't go to school! HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS!!!!!!!!!!!
"Russian 2S19 designed to shoot shells long distances." It's called Artillery WSJ! As a former Redleg, I couldn't be more disappointed.
All there were made from selling gas. It’s like mexican mafia who buys arms rifles from selling drugs
I love how social media can be used for military intelligence gathering now. A large army like Russia's can't move 1 mile without being spotted.
https://youtu.be/zzrz3u7DAHc
nah your late, its happening already you bozo :D
Now time to stop Russia's invasion against Ukraine anyway otherwise it will create inspiration to take control territory of other countries like China can take control of Taiwan and some part of India. North Korea can try to start war against South Korea. Israel can take control full Palestine, Mayanmar can start genocide again it's ethnic communities etc.  War can't be a solution it only can destroy. So please stop war against humanity.
wsj showing russia which places  need to be filled up
Can we all agree that Romney was right in 2012?
KETIKA  IRAK MENYERBU  KUWAIT. BUSH  : " SAYA AKAN MENGIRIM  500.000 TENTARA" KETIKA RUSSIA MENYERBU UKRAINA. BIDEN : "MARI  KITA  BERDOA  UNTUK RAKYAT  UKRAINA"
US and NATO push Russia all the time resulting war now, but US said it will not send a single soldier to help Ukraine,what a garbage country USA.
Imagine all the people living life in peace 🕊️ without war and borders.. this is extremely sad and unfathomable for me.
"Tiktoks and satellite images show" yes that very reliable and verified source where teens make cringy and idiotic videos. What a great source to report on a war . 🙄
Welp. This aged well I guess
We lost so many lives because of this present pandemic. Now we will lose our planet if this war will break out and turn into a world war. God forbids.
Russia has no shame
I love how TikToks can compare to satellite footage at this point
Whats crazy is how russia lies to their own public, controls their media and does not allow people to protest
Seems russia is building up a army to start a full scale invasion. I pray Joe Biden and the world leaders know what they are doing and how to handle this dark situation. Doomsday clock is also at 100 seconds till midnight which is the closest it's ever been. God bless everyone suffering from these dark times and lets pray that the good will prevail. May god be with us all🙏🙏
USA TEROR  RUSSIA👍🏻👍🏻🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
no rat would build a rattrap.
Why aren't a bunch of drones constantly showing us what's happening right now?
for the record, we can see so many russian tanks here becuase russians have had the largest number of tanks now,, more than the rest of the world combined, altough they are ancient, still good enough for kiev
Does anyone consider Ukraine is the Cuba in Cuba Missile Crisis when US was not happy missiles were deployed in Uncle Sam's backyard and HOW had Kennedy acted then?  Does Putin have other options when US and NATO trying hard to push him into the corner?
Yeaayyy!! War of World part 3 will coming soon 💪💪 if the third world war occurs, I hope China will be destroyed by the enemy. 😅
I didnt know tiktok can be useful
We are at the time where we casually say: Hey have you seen that tiktok about the russian invasion?
Remember in the US 2012 Presidential debates... Stupid Obama mocked Mitt Romney for suggesting Russia would eventually wage war in Europe.... And dumbbell Obama thought he was funny.... saying... What is this, some 1980s movie plot.... And he got his dopey supporters to laugh.... Hmm....
That scary do we know how many tank they and other eupmin
The Invasion has begun, WW3 has begun.
Russia's crime against humanity. Putin has dug his grave.
And if they take control of Ukraine, how long before they go after Poland and the Baltic countries. Putin is trying to reconstruct the old USSR.
Here we go!😔
"Only Military drills, no plans to attack Ukraine" - Putin Yeah right, awesome story bro... (chugs down a galloon of skooma)
Data mining Journalism at its best
I can imagine how much Putin hates tiktok right now. It's super hard to have a secret military mission when your own people are uploading your every move several days before your attack.
Great reporting but wish could post a bit earlier
The Wall Street Journal want to be a " news source" now. Too late lefty
I will share my experience with the people of Europe, Russia is not an ordinary country that went to war with her, and try to strengthen the Polish border well, that Russia will cross Ukraine, then it will be too late ...
We'll destroy Ukraine and anyone who comes in our way, we will destroy them all too. You better stay away from our country business. Long Live Russia 🇷🇺
The Ukrainian PEOPLE are protecting not only their territory from the russian invader, but also all security in Europe and the world. If Ukraine loses, the whole world loses. God help UKRAINE. 🇺🇦❤🙏
Time to dust of the nukes
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted".  YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.  If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land. AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.  This, then, is how you should pray:  Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  "Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search. These are the teachings, The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God. REPENT, and start doing what is right. If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.  Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.  In the New Heaven and the New Earth, only Righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.
This is what happens when you have a weak  frail old surrounded by cowards and leaches leading the world's super power. Afghanistan was a tipping point letting our adversaries know they are free to act without consequences
Maybe it’s just a flash mob and everyone will start dancing to an abba song.
let’s go Brandon, Brandeau and Brutin!
Moscow Pootin is killing civilians in Ukraine. TerroRussia has to be destroyed ! Glory to Ukraine!
Good get my money back
Shohan shikder should intervene to stop this war
BIDEN AND ATTACKS ON IRAQ, SYRIA AFGHANISTAN CAN?
The tiktok dudes are probably dead now because This is Illegal in russia to do.
Need a nuclear war destroy humanity bcoz we don't deserve to survive as a species
Need to tell a balance news
God bless Ukraine, tears in my eyes. Praying for all children and families🇺🇦❤
USA and NATO is behaving like a global mafia and gangsterism
American Military Industrial Complex finally smiling to the banks
Looks nice, just I want to ask why you mix timing? January 19 - Yelnya is full with military equipment, but next statement is “January 12 is empty “ For the records: January 12 NATO declines Rusian “red lines” Question: who pulled the trigger?
Putin said he won't set foot and invde Ukraine accusing the west of war mongering and spreading panic. But he did afterall. Now he said, he won't occupy Ukraine and that citizens will not be harmed. I doubt he won't. 10 civilians have already been killed. He cannot be trusted afterall.  I used to like him. Now he is just another lunatic trying to reestablish USSR glory.
Uraaaa 🔥 👍 🇷🇺   🇮🇩 Kami mendukungmu.......
The war is here
NATO SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT HAPPEN ON UKRAINE, NATO GIVING A HOPE TO UKRAINE THAT LEAD THESE SITUATION HAPPEN!!! PROVOKED RUSSIA THAT HAD BEEN SANCTION SO MANY TIMES!! DID YOU THINK THEY GOING STRAIGHT TO DO NOTHING?  NATO SHOULD GUARANTEE THAT ALL UKRAINE'S PEOPLE'S SAFE!. BRING IT ON!! STEP IN THAT WAR!!
Getting my popcorn ready. Netflix be like: This is some good content lets make a series
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, big boys?
This is the result of Biden's America & the democrats that supported his administration
Bruh
if this would lead to a worldwar 3 then prophecy is being fulfilled in front of our eyes. where will people run to. haven't we preached this news to you ?  haven't you heard that Elijah already came back in this age. what was the mission of Elijah.  what is the message that is being preached around the entire globe.  hmmm.. i pray for those who are still alive that finally they can have eyes and ears to listen and to flee for safety . we are still preaching. untill we will be silent ..and wait.. May Elohim blesses you all
It’s invaded.
I would never expect to see tiktok and satellite imaging in the same sentence covering a war
It happend
putler
CONGRATULATIONS PUTIN!!! SAVE RUSSIA!!! PATIENCE IS OVER!!!! THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES INVADED COUNTRIES LOOTED THEIR RICHES AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS SILENT....... RUSSIAN STRENGTH!!!
CONGRATULATIONS PUTIN!!! SAVE RUSSIA!!! PATIENCE IS OVER!!!! THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES INVADED COUNTRIES LOOTED THEIR RICHES AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS SILENT....... RUSSIAN STRENGTH!!!
CONGRATULATIONS PUTIN!!! SAVE RUSSIA!!! PATIENCE IS OVER!!!! THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES INVADED COUNTRIES LOOTED THEIR RICHES AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS SILENT....... RUSSIAN STRENGTH!!!
all the shock and outrage below, where was that when NATO liberated Libya and all the other countries the west has invaded and destroyed. Stop being hypocrites. Russia just doesnt want NATO on their border. Ukraine did this to itself.
The report given within this tagged link spoke to the profundity of the conflict. To better understand the root cause of the conflict click on this link: https://youtu.be/nK-yJD_fAtk
I thought war between two countries are over and it is now a thing of the past in this age
difference between "looking dangerous" and "being dangerous".Russia  describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard  to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use  nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of  weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of  aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the  very existence of the state is threatened.   oops  google russia deadhand  The 'Perimeter' system, dubbed in the United States and Europe the 'Dead  Hand', is an automatic control system for a retaliation nuclear strike.  To put it simply, if Russia's territory is devastated after a nuclear  attack, the Perimeter system automatically strikes the enemy's territory  with its own nuclear missiles
World War 3 is around the corner
Ukraine's condition will get worse, this is only the trailer , the picture is still left And NATO will continue to watch the spectacle as a mute spectator, Russia is not going to make any difference to this empty threat, America and its stooges have no place, it has been proved in Afghanistan, America first started the policy of expansionism, Whoever comes with Ukraine will also get a lesson, this is the gunpowder of cold war.
Why US Just see.. If the know... That will be a big invasion.. If Iraq n Osama.. They Just fighting.. Fearness fo US against Russia millitary
Wow russian millitary is powerful
what does putin want ? 😥
I wish our media was this detailed with our illegal interventions
listen to the americans, they are good at starting or provoking wars
time to see who’s stronger
All the pro Russian comments absolutely disgust me, how someone can agree with the slaughter of innocents is beyond me. But karma will come and get them, just looking at Russia's economy crashing is sweet karma. My prayers go out to all the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country, families and lives of innocents.
Will this be declared by WHO and CDC as Wardemic....., Will see
Unnecessary innocents being killed a time will come powerers have to pay the price,,,,,o God save the innocent people God hear thair prayers amen
America and western countries just make sanction and intimidation for Russia is nothing 🤣🤣🤣，your don't dare directly military clash with Russia, because your cowards
It happened 2 hours ago.
When USA invaded Iraq and murdered the people there because they thought there was a weapon of mass destructions there and turns out there was none... and no one sanctioned the USA... also they left Afghanistan in shambles... and no one sanctioned the USA again. hahaha Weird..
Like a Syria Libya Iraq kosovo nothing new
It's time for the West to suffer the consequences of electing weak leaders and years of leftist political propaganda.   You created the monster that is now unleashed.
TikTok?
This video has aged well
soon this satellites are going to be obsolete
This aged well
wow tiktok now working for US intelegent 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sanctions are not going to stop Russian invasion in sovereign state of Ukraine,, #US & #NATO should intervene militarily otherwise USs & NATOs survival is on question & Global order & #UN presence in question
Where is Usa and NATO?
The fear has come true. Military operations in Ukraine have begun. My prayers for people there. God bless..
Ukraine made wrong moves with NATO and the US.  Now is payment day.
Prayers for RUSSIA 🇷🇺 AS THEY GO IN AND CLEAN EVERYONE INSIGHT 🏆
#STOPWARWEHATEWAR #STOPWARWEHATEWAR  #STOPWARWEHATEWAR
we've been here before, i'd argue the initial invasion of Crimea was much more serious, most likely were going to see a Palestine scenario were an aggressive foreign power slowly chips away at a countries sovereignty over a long period of time measured in decades
Interesting
Russia should be banned and thrown out of the window from UN NATIONS. All children of russian politics should be deported to Russia asap.Ławrow is next ribbentrop and will end like him. This is the start of end of russian empire just like Portugal in Angola or UK in Africa back in the days.  There is a principle rule in politics that whoever rules for 20 years must go insane on some point of time and we are witnessing it now with Putin. He things he is next car 🤦 God bless russia 🇷🇺Imagine all countries on the world start fighting suddenly for history disputes and lands. Sometimes you just need to move on for peace and greater good.
Oh Soloti Russia I thought I heard something else.
Here we go. They invaded
Please 🙏 make humanity between Russ and Ukraine other God is always with truth
Good predictions. Its happening unfortunately.
They did it
Tik Tok ? REALLY??
This title/headline has all the right buzzwords haha
Wouldn't it be lovely if all militaries of all countries vowed to turn onto their own government in the event of creating war for no good reason? Imagine how many innocent people wouldn't be blown to smithereens. How many children would be spared the inevitable collateral damages of war? Children are going to die. They're going to be burnt to a crisp and crushed under collapsing foundations. Does this sound deranged? You must be delusional to think this is anything but reality that is literally unfolding before your very eyes.

Rational reflection would wonder why WSJ et al have not been utilizing these methods to oversee expose support accountability upon USA itself? Like the situation amid Donbass region, USA corporateers kleptocrats shills been involved by proxy or directly for several years & more, not only misinformation obfuscation, beside over two decades & longer ScAmerika promote exploit indulge own methods state-sponsored terrorism invasion occupation oppression depotism inhumane atrocities imposed at various scales domestic international, yet few overt exposure while mostly suppressed. Also for as long, despite purporting advocating so-called energy independence or security, been extracting exporting own resources, not recently appeared at ports like was stated. Obviously the usual useful suspect characters & idiots employ promote impose coerce exploit conflict destruction harm socio-econ disparity beside obfuscate divert misinform deceive, I'm referring to ScAmerika kleptocrats corprorateers shills GSE NGO conniving parasitic systemic corruption.
People Hallo!!! Listen what says tv and cut half. WHY you all so believe that Russia wants to get Kiev?!!! Who powdering your brains so much?!!! Where this hundred dead solders?!!! Anyone saw them or it just like Arabs creating fake movies… America all the time puts it’s nose everywhere around globe creating conflicts. If America would not put military bases all around Russia - nobody would start any conflict. Russia and Ukraine is a brothers since centuries. America faaaar away on other continents and still trying to muddy the water. After years all Slovenia countries will ask back in Union. It will be great country because we always was near and mix among each other genetically. It’s our history. Beiden can put his bases into his as* and sit in his own country. Soon America will fall apart Avon states and America will be Zero on global scene. Why, because instead to care about own people it all the time puts the nose into other countries business. Why? - Because of money. NATO renting helicopters and military stuff from privat persons. This how NATO washing money.
This video is much more informative and well presented than most news channels
Whr r those mouth supporting country?
Putin is just the modern day Hitler. All that power trip will end up badly for him
2015...2019... Russia: "Minsk II" France/Germany: "What?" 2020... Russia: "Minsk II" France/Germany: "What?" 2021... Russia: "Minsk II" France/Germany: "What?" 2022... Russia: "Donbass Recognition" France/Germany: "Minsk II" Russia: "What?"  Thank God that Mother Russia is bringing this nightmare to an end for good. Long live Russia! Long live Donbass! Ukraine nazism must die!
america is fu___^ed now , i am so happy west think they are god or something like that , always meddling in other people business , show what you can do now europe
While criticizing Russia attacking Ukraine, don't forget damning Canadian Governments (led by Trudeau) cracking down Protesters! Same thing: Bullying!
TIK TOk images 😂
PUTIN: Now a few very important words for those who might be tempted to interfere in what is happening: whoever tries to hinder us, moreover, to create threats to our country and people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and that it will lead you to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. "  👍
And all because of a little man with a USSR fever dream
Do you know how many tanks exist around the world? Do you know how many universities exist around the world?  Do you know how many people are hungry and living under the poverty line? Why do most politicians waste the world's resources to build a military and make war? We need the world without war, the world without a military, the world without an idiot president, and corrupt governments.
when this war broke out into europe vs russia war.. then the pillar of peace in the East China Sea is also likely to collapse, this momentum can move China to invade Taiwan.. West will face 2 very large theaters of war, can it prevent all this destruction? Allahua'lam
Over all in history tells us Russians are just not very good people.
Dear God, Please create the world without war, the world without a military.
The fog was definitely hired by the Russian military
Wow, Russians moving their troops in Russia. Shocking.
Best thing to do is to get a booster shot 🤣
Kieth Woods: "russian" oligarchs Zelensky early life check
Amazing analysis. Sad reality 😢

All superpower countries are superpower for namesake.
Go Russia .....God Bless you all.
Massive increase in Russian dancing girls on tiktok is a sure sign of imminent invasion.
😶
The Lord weeps at what we do on this earth.
Told you.... Russia is no Iraq Syria Libya or Afghanistan....
Where is powerful uncle sam.uncle sam has created this mess .if cuba joins russia how usa will feel the same way russia feels and if you are willing to take ukraine in nato then fight for them coward usa.
Dont worry guys they are just peacekeepers
Putin gonna get a lot of angry letters from NATO for this 😂
Yeah tiktok is my go to source for military intelligence too.
4 hours later, it already begun...
Too late. War already begun. Pytin already announced and tanks just tolled into Ukraine
Like The American president we can only pray for Ukrainians . He did it Joe. He did it.
Why not become a neutral country? Ukraine joining NATO is stupid. It's like two boxers eyeing each other side by side. Ukraine should act like the referee in between. Russia/Putin already made it clear for the past decades that they don't like NATO and its allies near its borders. It's just like the Cuban missile crisis.
History doesn't repeats itself, people does!
Glad that Russia supports Donetsk Self-determination color revolution!💪💪💪 people want to rule themselves them should let them do
Putin is in red eyes
Dang
can we talk about surveillance society tho? 📡  🛰
OMG!!! THE TENTS ARE HEATED!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Sorry for my ignorance.  But why is America so hyped up with the tensions between Russisa and Ukraine? Can anyone explain?
Ukraine needs Respect!!!
What happened to the Covid 19 🧐

😭😭😭😭😭
Go Russia
What headphones does the reporter use at 4:54?  (this is great reporting and what's happening is horrible but had to ask, sorry for the trivializing)
Will the Russians who filmed these videos get in trouble?
With all the problems in the world, it's beyond me that waging war is even in someone right mind.. smh
ABOUT F@#%ING TIME WW3 GOT STARTED.
Gosh please hire a new narrator. This one is unbearable to listen to.
What about the Russian troops in Belarus?
Ahhh carajo Ami!!! Con mentiritas
Best option now for west and Ukraine is to come to the table because either they try to defend and die in thousands, still lose it will still end on the table don't let it take lives before you know how serious Russia is about their security.... Use your brains now
Go Russia Go !
Go Russia. Love from India
Anti tanks and anti aircraft weapons should be on the hands of those Ukrainian para military groups right now.  This will be Russia's second Afghan war.
Ukraine = Serbia 1999
OIL prices will skyrocket again¡!!!! u freakin war mongerers
Lol, we just had a missile inbound alert at our base, and it wasn't a drill. I am still alive tho, so I guess it was a drill.
Come on Japan 🇯🇵…. NATO has nine “partners across the globe” or “global partners”, which the Alliance cooperates with on an individual basis. NATO’s global partners include Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan…
God Please help to stop this war...
Can we just talk how russia has to f#ck off?
Greetings to all from Russia. The war has officially begun. Putin said in his address that we are talking about the complete demilitarization of Ukraine and the bringing to justice of all war criminals who have been destroying civilians for many years.  It was also stated that any country trying to interfere in the events will face such consequences that it has never faced before in its history. So now it remains only to observe what is happening. I hope the Ukrainian army will simply surrender without a fight.. because otherwise a lot of people will die, mostly Ukrainian soldiers, which the Russian people would not like very much, since the Ukrainian and Russian peoples are essentially one people.  Ukraine was the territory on the border of the Russian Empire. Russian Russian for the name Ukraine means "on the edge", that is, Ukrainians are Russian people who lived on the edge of the country. Now we also call Russian citizens living in Siberia Siberians - but this is not a separate ethnic group, it's the same Russians just living in Siberia.
Putin is another Stalinist russian criminal dictator war monger, he needs to be punished for his crimes against humanity.
I hear a lot of propaganda here, they told us the same 💩 about Iraq in 2001…
what do we actually care about the Ukrainian, let Putin get it (a good 80% of the people who live there prefer to be Russians anyway)
Those are T-90s
Why do we need spies in Russia when we have Russian Tik tok users
🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊
If Russia wants to, it can overwhelm Ukraine very quickly. This is not a fair fight. Sanctions ain't gonna stop 'em.
"suggesting Russian Troops are on the move....".  Really?  "a large scale attack is looming to the north..."  Really?  You know that, do you?  The Wall Street Journal, a newspaper, has "analyzed dozens of photos ....."  .  Well, I'm glad to know that. If the WSJ had just been or assertive during the Vietnam war, maybe it wouldn't have lasted 10 years.  Oops!  They didn't want it to end.  Too much money to be made off of Government DOD contracts.  Hmmm. They also analyzed photos on SOCIAL MEDIA?  Now we have Social Media determining our National Defense Strategies. I'd say this entire video is Misinformation.
Putin might ban their internet for a while so that their people don't give leaks
New Cod game of we all survive this...
Objective reporting, thank you
A lot of guessing
Chill out vladdy daddy 🥵
The Ukraine fighters should look at all the footage from the Afghan people destroying the Soviet soldiers in 1979+ learn their tactics even if Ukraine doesn't have mountainous regions like Afghanistan.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
well its on guys
Putin and Kim jung un about to invade at the same time lol, The moment Russia strike that first blow which will happen, Kim will move on south Korea whilst China take Taiwan and Japan with ease.
He is the Czar-Punisher! The Orthodox Crusader!
Just when things started to get closer to back to normal
Who cares. With biden as president, we won’t be able to help them. Only the American people will hurt
Accept Jesus Christ into your heart and follow him. Don’t follow the world.
Seems to me America wanted the war ..more then the Russian....Putin wanted to join NATO in 2008 was rejected...but Nato despite assurance in 1990...not to move east...already is at Russia door...America war machines..and NaTo needed an to make an enemy out of Russia..so they did...everyday..I hear war drums beating....and its USA beating the drums...already they got what they wanted...Nord stream 2...more kids coming home in caskets..and dead Ukrainians will be collateral damage..why are they not listening to a very rationale putin ?? The only way to stop..war is fir American...European to take push back on their government..
you guys looks like afking sitting duck, now everybody knows that you are not capable of doing anything, its exposed.......
Here we go. The attack has begun.
Well duh, it’s winter and cold outside so the camps will be heated. Very normal. What planet are you on?
Hi, sorry you didn't get the memo WSJ.. you're no longer believable and relevant.. but Ty💖 for all the years of DS.BS you silly Mockingbirds you. so, C'ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.. 🤣 ! Hug's 🥰   P s.

Read the " Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances ", UK and USA and Russia has guarranteed  territorial integrity of Ukraine. That is already sufficient reason of USA and UK getting involved.  But if you recall Brandon ( when he was VP in Ob era ) force Ukraine President to fired their AG on investigation of Hunter B bribery scandal by withheld financial aid, you would not be surprised Brandon is just doing mouth and deco work on Russia.
Videos posted not on social media but on TikTok 😂
Well duh, it’s winter and cold outside so obviously the camps will be heated. What planet are you on?!
Talking about Spying.. LOL..
Well duh 🙄 it’s winter 🥶 and cold ..so obviously the camps will be heated! Hello, what planet you on?!
Russia no nothing but SMASH i feel sorry for whoever face them.
Russia no nothing but SMASH i feel sorry for whoever face them.
How does all of this affect the central bank digital currency of Ukraine?
Meanwhile the Ukrainians aren't putting troops on their border. They are waiting on NATO to save em.
The west has never been objectively minded and sincere enough to solve the problem amicably. Russia has wait too long. And now they has to do what they have to do for great mother Russia. Note the superpower make rules. Time is of essence.
Can’t they attack Russia instead of protecting Ukraine ?
As the pandemic winds down, World War III is just getting started
I hate to say it, but Ukraine doesn't stand a chance.
its official we're headed to world war three.
nice wsj got nothing else then their source from app for doing stupid dance
So much fear mongering. They're not going to invade, they got what they wanted
if Tiktok is your source of news, then you need to heavily reconsider all your choices in life
you have six million miles of land, but you go and rob a small dead end of land, so that the world condemns you as a butcher, is a bandit worth it, wherever you go people will stay away,  Do you need that little piece of land to make your grave?
All the while this is going on... TRUMP CONTINUES TO KISS PUTIN'S AZZ
Shame on You, Russia!
Russia will win……..again
all Russia asked was that Ukraine not to join NATO.  Is that so hard?
The attack on ukraine is 💯 percent .....
Western Democracies must not let Ukraine fall
Man I’m out here trying to live a normal decent life but unfortunately we have psychotically immoral sociopaths that run countries and want to ruin everyone’s birthday cakes
Russia needs extreme sanctions if they invade, cut them off from the world. Scumbags.
Good!
So the army is moving ...i thought they would stay stationary for the next 3 years...!!!
Wow
America invaded a lot of countries. Now it's time for Russia . NATO is based. The child of Zionism .
This where and how world wars start
behind the crisis:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opxCv7zf3Gc
ALL ABOUT MONEY
All this instigating. Where’s the documentary on America genocide
Well, I just read 3 minutes ago in the AP News that Putin announced operations in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Invasion has begun.
What if they are preparing to defend not attack..and why would you trust US which has done lot more war crimes in the past few decades.
RUSSIA is  greedy ,,  the same north viet nam
Remarkable report
Why are we not giving them more weapons
At this point, kinda just hurry and get it over with. I mean gas is almost 5 dollars a gallon
china and taiwan tensions left the group, lol
by recognising the 2 new republics within ukraine, putin has allowed the seperatists do his dirty work. DREAMWIDOW
god bless tiktok
Guess they said what they meant and did what they said eh?
Let's go Brandon!
Never poke a grizzly bear. This is Russia's sphere of influence.
Cloud ☁️ logic make ..make me think good proganda video....ah 🙂🤭
to come? 😊
I also want to say, "Good always prevails, always" it's very possible the world may soon be ruled under Russia and China but over a long time, that will just embolden "good people" to rise above their own expectations when it affects them and they have had enough.  Humanity today thinks everything is about them. My rights - not yours, my property to defend, my feelings - matter more, my religion - it right / yours is not, etc. From the time our country started, people fought for Independence, freedom from slavery, women's rights, gay rights, etc. Those that fought realized, it's about them. Most of those fight for what is right knew they most likely would not see the results. It's not about them. It's about the future of all and it's time to help everyone. Many times, we just have to do what is right and not act on how we feel.  I am the founder of Citizens of the World. We are first responders helping people in world catastrophes. My motto is "It's time to help everyone. Here's one of my videos on what we do and who we have helped https://youtu.be/0F3dA8NGqWg
What we and NATO do in the next few days will give Russia and China an idea of how the US and NATO will react in the future. I'm a combat veteran and we need to show fall that we mean what we say and are wiling to back up freedom at all costs. Otherwise, It lasts years and years. They want to take over the worlds economy and  set world policy. The decision here is, do we let them because it will happen and China will join in. It all comes down to... do we fight now and win or later and lose. China's leader didn't increase their military forces for no reason. They are going to take those shipping lanes China's current leader will do it during his reign and not leave it to his predecessor. Think about it, would you?
Russia are comfortable having China as allies  Hoping all of the world act like the uk and us who gave sanctioned them
I didn't know TikTok will be a source of military intelligence
NATO should give a Ukraine membership in current situation.
Be honest, how many of you sicko deep down secretly hope that Russia invade Ukraine cause you just curious about a potential WWIII.
Putin marching in invading killing innocent Ukrainians and the only response of EU-USA is suspension of business with the dictator🤣. Really pathetic!
American politics is all about making money and make allies from where they make money. Now Ukraine is worthy for them. Europe may become like destructed in WW2 so be ready to build if the planet and life on the only Earth survives. Putin should step back from war we the world sympathise the sanctions on your country but our duck politics cannot do much about it. The Pandemic could not take many lives as targets set in 2015-17 by some powerful people so it seems Ukraine war is being created that may lead to nuclear to depopulate the planet. Africa be ready to take care of European and American survivors if any as it's is a war of superpowers  How stupid the Americans can go to think about a war in nuclear age? Mad mad Joe.
This opens the door for China to take Taiwan
Are they preparing to liberate Canada?
Why russians snitches on their own military lol
Looks Mostly peaceful to me
It is better to practice peace not war
Russia Army don't flatten cites as they move unlike the Americans.
I'm thinking Russia is just doing this to flex thier new Su 57 , Ka 52 and Mi 28 NM.
Russia this is not God's direction 🙏🕊️.
This section should be called baaaaahs not comments..
Russia is not of God if they invade Urkraine etc .
The United Nations has certified that Iraq has completed its compensation obligations for the Kuwait’s invasion. Now, we are the honorable, patriotic and loyal Iraqis, and not the agents of America, Iran and the Gulf rulers, are demanding compensation from the USA, Britain and their Gulf allies for the occupation and destruction of Iraq that includes the material damages as well as moral and psychological damages. We are seeking TEN trillion dollar compensation.
American government is warmongering, military-industrial complex is profiteering and Russian are waiting to blow United States Of the surface of this earth
China never do this type of journalism
He's not gonna invade. He's making things appear like he's going to invade to force a deal of his favor on Ukraine.
Talk about eavesdropping
Russian allow this thing to saw by the enemy for psychological in fact to its enemy, "can they now over power Russia? according to what they saw,,
trump wouldnt let this happen///
The universe is made up of mathematical patterns! Can order be created from chaos? Ie...Can one drop a bunch of steel, aluminum and plastic from the sky onto one part of the ground below and expect a car to be created? Darwin renounced his theory on his deathbed. Why aren't ALL apes human by now anyway if we truly evolved? Apes and tadpoles still exist separate from us do they not? Why don't we see tadpoles evolving into human beings today?   The Divine #3: 3 Primary colors (to create from). Sun: 3 diff rays. 3 Kingdoms: plant, animal, mineral. Matter: gas, liquid, solid. Forces of Nature: gravity, light, electricity. Atom: neutron, proton, electron. Matter cannot even exist without 3! For such "creation," I believe there is a creator: Father, Son, (Jesus = God in the flesh) Spirit.    From Google Search: Everyone's skin grows in a slightly different environment. That's why it's so unlikely anyone has the same fingerprints as you – about a 1 in 64 billion chance. -    4 different seasons; night and day, sun during the day, moon and stars at night. We have the ability to heal, reproduce, have emotions. No two fingerprints are alike. Creatures can breathe underwater. Most birds can fly. From the tiniest ant to the tallest mountain, things are made. It takes more faith to prove God doesn’t exist than there is to prove he doesn’t. Burden of proof is on the former. He is a Creator w/ order.   So, He is real. What must happen? He sent His Son on earth nearly 2,000 years ago.  Follow His teachings (New Testament Bible) and receive eternal life. Acts 2:38 (Repent and be baptized for forgiveness of sins and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.) Jesus was seen by 500 witnesses walking around ALIVE AFTER he died! He showed himself for 40 days before rising up to heaven. I hope you follow Him too.  Go go to heaven my friend.  BTW only 5.6% of the population in the us is “Gay etc…” Why promote “pride?” It doesn’t make sense, dishonors the creator and dishonors the 94.4%. Makes sense to me...what do you think? Perhaps He will relent of these plagues (Covid, drought, severe weather)  and WW3. Plagues affect food, gas, and water prices. Killing His creation in the womb has dire consequences too. I mean, don't you want to live life without war? Why not bring HIM back into public schools and offices because since 1962, society has gone down as a result of removing Him from it. That also makes sense to me...what do you think?   7 plagues currently ongoing: 1. Millions of Locusts in Africa/Mid East (over one year now)  One swarm can eat what a population of 35,000 people can eat. Plus they multiply. 2. Mega Droughts in SW USA (will raise food and gas prices) 3. Bird Flu in Russia 4. Covid  5. Large quakes (7 over 7.0 since 1/21). 6. 29 actively erupting volcanoes world wide!!! 7. Millions of Mice/Rats in Australia  eating crops.    Acts 2:38. Go to heaven my friends. 7 current plagues on earth (Google it.) Be close to HIM. Save yourselves. He will be here soon. Genesis 6 is similar to Matt 24. The Man himself said, it will be like the days of Noah. (Gen 6 meaning the fallen angels mixed their DNA w/ mankind....similar to what Pfizer and Moderna are doing w/ mRNA mixing w/ mankind. Just read NEW TESTAMENT in bible. Jesus is God who decided to become flesh/human and came down to sacrifice himself so that we wouldn’t die for how sinful we are since no one is perfect. By doing this, people who believe and follow His teachings are made right with Him once again. (death to sinful sefl) & baptism allows the cleansing/rebirth of a soul. That’s amazing love for you and an opportunity.. No Mohammed, Bhudda or other has done that. Abolish killing of babies thru abortion. Abolish LGBTQ support, fake presidency and fake MSM because maybe He will relent. Please DO NOT mandate “fake vaccines.” Look up Georgia Guidestones. Rule #1 is to REDUCE and maintain population at 500,000,000. Don’t give in.
GENERALS GATHERED IN THE MASSES..... just like witches..
Any country with nuclear power can invade any country they deem to be enemy period. End of humanity is near ladies and gentlemen.
It's a trap set by putin and the West has stepped into this trap. And that means Russia will get a legitimate cause to attack Ukraine. But Russia is not going to invade Ukraine. Her plan is to change the current ukrainian government.
I have been following Ukrainian telegram pages for years and have seen videos of of Ukrainians killing and bombarding their civilians on the east and cutting of the heads of 18 year old Russian soldiers who aided in 2014. Ive read the comments of young Ukrainians under these videos. There is no sympathy. Russia wont be able to convince who the real monster is, because US controls the media.
it's sad that we get more information on this from tik tok then from the actual media
Tiktoks 😁
nah guys i think they just doing routine exercises
Putin consider Ukrian Russians and part of Russia, he won’t kill Ukrainian even if he invade Ukrian
Preparation for the modern version of The Battle of Stalingrad. Hail Russia. Genius Putin!
Russia is upset with Ukraine..for what? Let Ukraine live in Peace..why choose death over life..maybe russia is a sad place to live and  they want people to be as miserable as them...leave the past in history books...learn and move on...get a life
What if Nato agreed that Ukraine wouldn't join Nato with stipulations that Nato would defend Ukraine if Russia invaded. Would Russia have agreed? Well we wouldn't know because that request was denied by Nato. So here we are. From news outlet that was one of the biggest concerns and request by Russia that Nato denied. Russia said they would withdraw if they had papers drawn up stating this. Nato denied it. So Putin like ok it's on! That's the main thing i get out of it from news media that's not here in U.S.
Maybe war is their intention maybe not but you gotta admit this video is reading into the evidence because they want to ‘see’ war… propaganda? 🤔
Jeez....russia  doing this for oil which will become useless in a few years. Clean energy taking over the industry, therefore  innocents people will die for nonsense and for nonrhing. May God protect them all.
Poland  ostria.Rumania.hungry.  Ready of korea weapon. AND  GAS have use of USA
Satellite images show a large convoy of trucks in Washington DC.
3:38 Are those even Russian Tanks? I've never seen Russian Tanks with ERA block configuration like that. Closest thing to that is the Ukrainian Modernized T-64s, and Russia does not have T-64s.  Edit: Those are T-80 tanks and I forgot about this particular variant since most T-80s are upgraded to T-80BVM or have those rubber shielding covering their ERA
T98 tanks LOL! There are no T98 - very grainy image but I am guessing its T-72BM3.  At 5:12 the ZZ at back of tanks / APCS is usually formation name.
WSJ has better Intel than my S-2 ever had! 😉
Just 3 decades ago when the Soviet Union collapsed, we thought that there is going to be peace, now history is repeating itself
Aliens be like this season of earth is fire af 🔥🔥🔥
I hope zelensky would be captured, but I’m sure he will pack up and leave b4 it really begins
Hopefully this video could also help all Ukrainians who are preparing to confront any of these possibilities in the coming days. Knowing what your aggressor is preparing to do is half of the battle the other half is when you confront it.
The only one to gain with this war is USA. Russia will not sell gas to Europe and Germany. USA will export liquefy gas to Europe. It will solve the inflation problem in USA temporarily. Which forces are behind Biden? Everyone can see that he´s atacking Russia every day in a loop and don´t let a door open to an end. And why he invited Ukraine for NATO in middle of a pandemic??? Nothing makes sense about this madman
Hey wsj, why don't you do same kind of reporting what Isreal is doing to Palestinian.
https://youtu.be/-1qju6V1jLM
Can you not show the real pictures that show what you claim. These "camps" that are showen on these old satelite pictures, can be struck out nearly total, with two to three bombs. You dont concentrate "resourses", if you are thinking to start a war. The emptying of the "camps" that are shown on these old pictures, indicate that they are moving back sustainable parts of the troups and equipment from the earlier training sites, to places deeper in to russia. As if THEY think that they are going to be attacked! And would you please stop the fake news regarding "depending on clouds, we can not take satelite pictures"!!  Thats just bogus.  When we studied space technics in the early 1990:s, even then, clouds were seldome any problem.   So stop theese bogus lies to cheat the "public".
Rooting for Russia. If Nato won't agree to stay away, they have no choice. They have had enough of Nato closing in.
America and Nato is responsible for this crisis
my thoughts and prayers are with ukrainian
No foreign entanglements
Good.  Ukraine is a vassal state of the U.S. Don't worry Putin will take out the Nazi trash running the place.
Russia: We are going to take this diplomatically. Media: Russia on the brink of full invasion. Russia: So you want us to do it. Ok
Been on the brink for years lol
where does media stay when its the US who invades ?
They are setting up this will scared major population which will cause them to leave their homes. Scaring them away. Russia won't attack but they'll just move in.
Democracy Stands with  the Ukrainian people
How much of this images taken r true indeed
The gas price in Russia must be low
Western media propoganda, have some shame
American military now is weak under biden administration even taliban they can’t beat how much more russia.
This is worrying. How about Ukraine? Is there any military build up in Ukraine to match the Russian's? Why Russia moving into Donbass? Will US and Nato intervene?
The rich were right to build those spaceships.
The Minsk Accords  Donetsk and Luhansk declared their independence from Ukraine in 2014, along with Crimea.   However, Russia only recognized Crimea’s independence. Crimea then applied for membership into the Russian Federation in February of 2014, in which they were granted. Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk are demographically made up of ethnic Russians, who speak the Russian language.  After the 2014 American sponsored coup-de-ta in Ukraine – also known as the Maidan Revolution – resulted in the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukraine; three provinces of Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk) did not want to be a part of the new regime. Victoria Nuland of the United States State Department was seen handing out bagels to the Maidan revolutionaries after successfully overthrowing the Ukrainian government.  This regime was very anti-Russian; they don’t allow ethnic Russians to speak their language in schools. It should be no surprise that in response to this new anti-Russian regime, the three provinces who are made up of majority ethnic Russians, declared their independence from Ukraine. Russia did not invade these provinces, they seceded.  Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk all sought recognition and annexation by Russia. Crimea was granted recognition and annexation due to historical and strategic reasons. However, until 2022, Donetsk and Luhansk were not recognized. For eight years, Vladimir Putin has been trying to and enforce the Minsk Accords. The Minsk Accords was for both Donetsk and Luhansk to be reintegrated into Ukraine and in exchange the Ukrainian government would stop its hostilities towards ethnic Russians. The Ukrainian government would allow the Russian language to be an official language and allowed to be spoken in public schools. Allowing the two territories to have a certain degree of autonomy.    Instead of abiding by this agreement that had been struck with the mediation of the French and the Germans; the Ukrainian government doubled down on anti-Russian measures and became evermore hostile. Putin waited eight years to recognize their independence.  What changed was the return to power in the United States of the same people who orchestrated the coup-de-ta in Ukraine.   Namely Antony Blinken (Secretary of State), Wendy Sherman (Deputy Secretary of State), and Victoria Nuland (Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs); who had the second, third, and fourth highest ranking positions in the state departments during the Obama years, now they are the three of the four most powerful people in the state department. They have renewed their hostility towards Russia. Putin is responding to events that are motivated by the United States.  On February 21st 2022, Vladimir Putin recognized the sovereignty of Donetsk and Luhansk.
no way russia is letting them having this information, they have another planthat won't be seen for sure
Go Russia
World War 3 Started Already on 22.02.2022 ✅✅✅🟤🟤when Russia invaded Donetsk and Lugansk 🎯🎯🎯🎯🔵🔵🔵🔴🔴🔴🔴⚫⚫⚫
Putin knows that Biden isn't going to do anything if he does invade.  It's going to be up to Europe to do something.
Putin wants USSR - FIRST UKRAINE 🔴🔵🔴 then the 15 other countries that were a part of Soviet Union 🟢🟡🟢 LOOONG WAR AHEAD 🟣🟣🟠🟠🟠⚫
haha never thought tiktok was actually useful
And no satellite images of belarus.. most closer to kiev...
When Obama was President in 2014 everything started in Ukraine! When Trump was President everything cooled down, and now that Biden is President again, Ukraine is again at war! Does anyone see a pattern? Democrats have no reason to spread their dirty hands on Ukraine and Russia!
Go USA!  Common America invade ukraine and slutti russia already!  Now is your best chance Joe
We always wondered what Putin wanted from trump. Why he tried so hard to mess with our elections so trump would win again and now we know why. This has been in the works for years
great reporting and explanation of russia's possible strategy here. now fire whoever did your captions.
Before 3rd region claim independence , no invasion. 😅 Putin just playing .
The famous military training exercise excuse...
SO WHAT!!! RUSSIA IS NOT THE PROBLEM! !! NATO IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. JUST BECAUSE NATO IS FRIGHTENED IT WILL NO LONGER BE THE GO TOO FINANCIAL MARKETS DOES NOT MEAN RUSSIA IS A THREAT... OPEN YOUR MINDS YOU FOOLS...
I had a dyslexic moment and thought it said a battalion of IVF....lol I'm like why are they trying to impregnate their soldiers???
fake News
Wow. It’s like we saw this coming. I mean we’re literally watching an Intel brief from public media. It’s almost like the people bitching about this drop the ball.  I guarantee if Trump was the president this would never have escalated to this.
This is left wing war monger fake news... Russia has been doing these exercises at those positions for quite a number of years, and with good reason. Remember, it's NATO who are bringing nuclear weapons on Russia's border even though they have guaranteed many years ago they would not expand towards Russia's border... Russia has no choice but to bring a stop to it. ALSO remember that Russia leads the world in nuclear weapon technology by a long shot... The west is lucky Putin has a measured approach, anyone else would have ended the west long ago.
Why did the US send their troops out of Ukraine in the first place?
Ukraine still want its freedom and democracy not a fake one.
Emperor Vladolf Blownapart
Stop aggravating, in order to make news
those videos on social media could be misinformation can cause more confusion and panic.
Ukraine - I am in danger
Know what they say about exercise? Gotta warm up first...
Bb24a
#standwithrussia
Doomsday….tick tock, tick tock.
Can we also see Ukraine military camp?
It's obvious that Russia is preparing for war, Ukraine must not be act right a way
I'm beginning to think Vladimir Putin hasn't been entirely truthful about his intentions.
Bet they attack, Ukraine should immediately surrender to save lives, either way, our petrol going to cost alot more.😡
tactics.  the same thing happened in the iraq war, they said there are weapons of mass destruction in the end it was all mentors.  now they want to create panic to provoke another war. USA is provoking but Russia is not alone,  who will start the III War be careful.
The US put the Ukrainian people in this position with their illusion of democracy but cannot defend them against the Russians.
Are you nuts???So its Russia's territory and follow to military doctrine if your neighbor  is hostile of course it would be cause to accumulate troops.
We're going to see WW3
NATO enlargement is responsible for this war
Hope they found the nuke like they did in Iraq.
Social media is killing it once again. Forget the news I go to YouTube for it lol.
As I look at that map and the two regions that were recently recognized by Russia as independent, I start to wonder if they aren’t planning to push west along the Sea of Azov’s and Black Sea’s northern coasts past Odesa to the Romanian border to cut off Ukraine’s sea access. The Crimean Peninsula is halfway along that route, so I’d think it would be relatively easy to push west, not knowing the terrain, of course. They could push south from the northeast and slice 1/3 of the country away. This could get really ugly (brilliant observation, I know).
First World War, kind of nervous
How about they disclose aliens so we stop fighting and work together
good job

Be weak, people take advantage
The world should not let this happen to them
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Putin and Russia had no problem,eastern Europe nations adopting western ideology, but the west start taking advantage turning it into geographical that’s wake up call for putin.
And what are we doing? Oh yeah that's right! Sanctions! Meaningless ones that no one's afraid of!
FJB
Good job RUSSIA. . GOODLUCK
what is the chance they ( Russia aka Putin) backs off??
oh ok nothing happens when usa invades iraq ,afghanistan ,syria whatnot..but when putin marches to donbass suddenly he is the new hitler?? ok.
Sadly, the Russian and Ukrainian peoples have forever had some Tsar or would be Stalin stepping on their necks. May Putin be the last in a long line. From Canada: Remember the Holodomor, Erase all tyrants, Peace on Earth, and God bless Ukraine!
Putin got the ears of the whole world. Just what he wanted.
USA has the business everywhere. Sitting in Pacific and Atlantic they poke their nose in Iran, Sudan, afghan, Libya etc. and now in Russina. Please just mind your business. The concern parties know how to solve their problems
Reagan would bomb and destroy every vehicle and tent with a "preeminent strike" now. Hey Putin, there's your war exercise. Now clean it up.
Russia just wants to avoid the nato/us operation barbarrosa 2.0! Nato had been amassing it's infrastructure to Russia's borders for the past 30 years!
So far the media has been right. And I want to give you guys credit.
The invasion of Russia?? Lol 😆
Jesus is the only solution for everything. Problems will continue until every knee will bow before Jesus Christ. ✝️🙏 humanity has to surrender to God! ❤️🕊🥺
You have got to be kidding! Is this serious journalism? What a joke!
You don't add that many field hospitals unless it's serious
This is total important and serious info, but it's really, really NOT somethings that (I) Like'.🤬💀☠🥺
😂😂😂😂 ignorants will believe this pictures "reading", this is so funny. Bravo for the expert
Will Russia halt their aggression once Eastern Ukraine is fully annexed? Or will they skip the salami slicer method, and fully invade Ukraine?  Things seems to be escalating quickly, and the fog of war seems to be encroaching.
Wonder how soon it will be before Russian government blocks their citizens from social media and apps from communicating outside of their country and sabotage main networks internationally . China blocked their people from using any international social media when people were 1st posting all those videos around start of pandemic because that made CCP look bad.
I'm playing Red Alert 3 as we speak, the only solution to the Red Invasion: dolphins
When west invade,freedom bomb and murder poor peoples its good...When others do the same thing its evil...Double standards, hupocracy at its best....Russia is doing wrong but these so, called democracies,murderers aren't good either...
This is the same exact thing China is going to do to Taiwan 😔
Evil never sleep, they just wait.
Utter madness
This Tik Tok guy is gonna disappear fast and I mean really really fast 😂😂
Don't worry about PUTIN ,  worry about the invasion on the RIO GRAND ... GO  PUTIN  GO ,   Get  rid  of  the U.N and  NATO ... The US is a JOKE ,  80 YEARS of wasting TAXPAYER MONEY on the U.N and NATO ... Time  for  the  U.N  and   NATO  to  PAY ,   and  SHEAD  their  BLOOD ...
No it not... it's only a minor incursion.. just ask joe
Ukraine should declare neutrality.
The world should be selling Ukraine enough ATGMs and MPADS for every man, woman, and child, to have three or four shots.
Or maybe they are just protecting the Russian border from a counteroffensive from Kyiv after they move into Dombass?
NATO isn't needed anymore, it was designed to balance the Soviet Empires' influence.  Russia is no longer a superpower, and has the economy strength on par with Australia.  Most Ukrainians have ties to Russia, and would rather be under Putin's' gangster regime.  Ukraine is NOT a NATO member, no US troops or assets should be involved,  Most my life this country has been at war with failure after failure.  Get our people out and leave.
Maybe Russia's words meant that taking Ukraine is like just an exercise for their military 😅
I cant wait
This is not a scare tactic
So, it’s in there territory! Who many bases does the USA have around the world?
If these troops can be spotted by satellites, why can't missiles be launched to take them all out?  Why waste time.  This new WW3 is bound to happen.  We're just delaying it.
In 2075: Welcome guys to a lecture on World War III, we are going to be talking about the timeline and the pre-preparation for the war. First, a key point in our timeline is Tiktok. Tiktok was a dancing app popularized around the world and also showed confidential videos of Russian troops moving their heavy equipment towards Ukraine's borders. Tiktok is the main point of this lecture.
The first ever TikTok war, can't wait.
It is going to be like 1956 Hungary, Budapest. Full-scale invasion.
Ukraine isn’t even a real country
Putin knows that he is monitored around the clock and use that for his own advantage
You don't need a field hospital for training! WW3 is coming 🥺
Start checking the mail boys!
The visual graphics are amazing. Great video thank you for shoeing people who don't know much about geography
Excellent report and fascinating analysis. Just one question, funny that with all of this technology and intelligence capability the US/UK were unable to defeat the rag-tag Taliban.  If the western coalition could not bring into a submission a nation of goatherders and poppy growers, what makes anyone think we'll do better against Russia with all of its strategic advantages?
The only real war no one is talking about is between Russia and Nato(USA). This whole thing has nothing to do with Ukraine. Can someone explain to  me why the US have hundreds of military bases in most of the European and close to Russia countries? What Russia is doing is and stays within their own borders while the USA are having military bases 10 000 miles away from their own country. 🤔
Go President Putin
Ukrainian insurgents can take the war to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Minsk by carrying out terrorist (car bomb, arson, subway, refinery, and airline, etc.) attacks on military targets and on the Russian population in this pending guerilla war. *****************************************************************************************************
The letter Z on those tanks is exactly same as the sign of soviet occupation forces that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968.
The USA is the root course if most of war in decades over the world. .This time is not an exception.
Nice fear mongering. Images of small military bases. Skeewy. Nothing is going to happen.
It's quite sickening how these journalists and nato spokesmen try to all demonize Putin and the Russians. They are stooges taking their cue from the US media. Putin wanted to join nato but was rebuffed because the US military industrial complex needs an enemy to profit from in war, and thus, keep up a command for wealth and prestige. This appears to be just shameful and evil. Invasion? the Donbas was a Russian province called 'Elizavetpol' under the Czars, and the Russians were invited in to these regions by their governors. Now, nato, who would not allow Russia to join, has its excuse for a greater war, which will greatly enrich the US military industrial complex and make many more billionaires. That is, of course, if the Bear doesn't take them all down.🐻
A 1939 moment...... PUTIN his legacy his disappointment from Yeltsin's demise and 1982 the wall falling.....a man the kgb snubbed....now stands to make his mark in a way that will be remembered for a misguided paranoia that stems from his  cold war recruitment.......once a GRU man always a GRU man determined to divide the west and conquer.......the Romans made the same mistake
Always knew they were gonna invade since day 1 of this military buildup.
Putin will fall sooner or later. He is leaving himself open for other countries  from the old Soviet Union to do some inside work.
your showing Russian troops moving in Russia....news is getting worse by the day pure anti Russian propaganda
Funny how US is never shown as the agressor. But history tells us.. USA always makes up stories lol   Russia can build up whatever they want inside their border lol
Next big thing will be web 3.0 based projects like crust network! Dont miss out on the next hype! Crust network!!!
But remember, Russia loves only peace 😐
Just remember NATO is sitting on Russia's border so it's only natural to defend its borders
West, that is an invasion. East, we are peacekeepers.
Ain’t military movement and all relevant are confidential ? Those Tik tok idiot just exposed everything, giving enemy the clue of what we have
JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU , DONT TAKE THE COVID19 VACCINE, GOD JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON TO EARTH , JESUS DIED FOR YOUR SINS , REPENT , REPENT...........

FK putin & his mafia cronies!
Somebody send Putin a football so he can take his ball and go back home!
Sneaky alcoholics!!!!😯
The only thing tik tok is good for
Where can you see these live satellite images?
Putin wants to join the N club... Lenin, Stalin and Putin.
Russia has got nothing to lose everyone is against them, so why not invade Oekraïne and all of europe, thats my thought of all this.
That is real deal. We are verge of it.
Soviet Union is coming back
Are you planning on part 2.     There seems to be a conclusion missing,  i mean this is all speculation just to be clear.   Would be nice to make the vdeo longer to fit the issues.  I feel like there was a hard stop at the end..
So much for OPSEC. All hail OSINT.
❤❤🇷🇺🇷🇺❤❤
I am from Ukraine and i am not afraid. We ready.
Ukraine is weak and feeble! I think it's time to put the squeeze on them.💂
Putin is a thug, I don't care what side of the aisle you're on. War like this can be avoided diplomatically.   I have no real experience with this kind of thing so I'm definitely out of my league here but Putin doing this stuff is just ridiculous
BREAKING NEWS: Russian Troops in Russia!!
When you thought 2020 and 2021 was bad
Since Rupert bought the rights to Publish the Journal the tone has changed little, but the quality of coverage seems to be suffering? The indications that Russia has defensive troops deployed inside their borders since the NATO demonstrations of last March 16, are as equally a potential defense against a Proxy Army that has US weapons invading Russia. Russia has been invaded several times from Western Europe. Moscow continues to celebrate the defeat of Germany every year. The ability to misrepresent Russian defensive deployment as an aggressive position bu Putin seems to offer no proof of such a plan, and seems to offer every indication that it is as big a lie as Scooter Libby presenting the image of WMD programs in 2003? Russia now provides 40% of European Union gas imports, they have the potential to double that supply, the US has no such ability and only seem to deliver 27% of LNG supplies into Eu ports....
... "a new field hospital added....     Suggesting possible casualties to come..."  That, right there, was the scariest part of this video for me........
Vladimir Putin is a crazy man. Clearly unstable for power. No reason to be invading Ukraine.
Russian bots in the comments: Россия не сделала ничего плохого, иди Россия
Dear WSJ writers: “Troop” is a misnomer that is misused about 95% of the time. It is a plural noun that means a group of soldiers. Please instead use the word members. That includes every branch of a country’s military (soldiers, sailors, pilots, and in the U.S., Marines). Accuracy in journalism, please.

We always c US satellite aerial shots but no Russian shots. There must b a reason
Biden is doing an awesome job so far!!!
US is the real problem. They are the one who creates problem for their own personal interest. And act like a hero. They spread fake news all the time and destroy others nation. They are not helping. They are making issues to make them believe that they are helping. Because they don't want other country will be higher than them. US scared that russia might have develope a very good relationship in Europe. Unfortunately, Leaders in europe are all puppets. Like no own opinion and no brain at all. As if Russia is a big threat for them. I can see Russia is a good country. The way the US play is so dirty like evil ! If there's a REAL sanction it should be sanction on US. US REAL TARGET IS CHINA because US debt to china more than $1 trillion. US find their way to Russia. US know that china will always back up Russia. Since the Philippines refused to be their battle ground😎 Ofcourse creating WAR is a business purposes in favor of US. The next target is Ukraine as battle ground. The Ukraine president has no brain. Another puppet will be born as new NATO's member! Welcome to the club :) Putin sending more thousands of russian troops as he is aware about NATO'S MOVEMENTS. Really a genius President ever. If people have no enough knowledge regarding their personal history between ukraine-russia, they will never understand the side of Russian President!🙏❤
In coupe days will be quiet in Donbass.
I feel like Russia is an integral part of Mongolia. Mongolia should invade it again to protect the Mongolian citizens of Russia.
Wsj is owned by Rupert murdoch, the most trusted source in the world.
The Wall Street Journal (no affiliation with the Kremlin) says Russia is going full invasion mode. Russian gold, silver, palladium, and platinum sales skyrocket. 🙋🇺🇲⚒️🇷🇺
Monir hosen alias Sajor pola monir is a horrific murderer. in 2001 monir brutally killed his neighbor Alomgir hosen . but no punishment of monir's crime.

NATO should honour it words and stop expanding east, simple
Putin moved his troops around = on the brink of invasion.  I watch Squid Game = 27 year old high school drop out.
Well done.
Who gives ppl the right to watch you with satellites?
Vlad the Impaler vs. Joe the Bewailer
We all gonna playing fallout VR soon for real
<3 respect to putin <3 respect to russia <3
Based Russia
Americans media is so full of lies you wonder what kind of journalists they hire. Russia will never invade Ukraine apart from the troops they've already sent to lugansk and Donetsk
Biden looks mentally disturbed because Putin share the vision with the right people at the right time.
You know you are a failing news organization spreading misinformation when you start quoting Tik Tok on matters military. American journalists are DESPERATE for a war
don't care
Yeah, Ukraine is lost
Somehow, Rasputin has returned
Psst ... it's free real estate.
Based
This makes me think of an obvious parallel of a belligerent strong man, irridentist intention, perfidy, and an excuse of ethnic exclaves as a means of invasion and usurpation of a sovereign nation and the rights of other peoples. Those who stand with Russia will walk the same path as those who supported this in the past.
awesome! looks like the world will be going to war!
did USA asked Russian permission when invaded and ruined Afghanistan or Syria or Libya ?  why on this time when Russia acting on her neighbor which concerned its own security sounds crazy ?  does USA have the moral to accuse   Russia for anything ?
The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing.
God bless us All! ✌❤
Nice photos and graphics. Why didn’t Biden do preemptive sanctions to discourage a war from occurring?
tik tok. really dude
"TikToks" and "Satellites" ! hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
This is an excellent report.  Thanks.
what about ukraine and nato do what could avoid such invasion !!which is to ensure russia that ukraine will not join nato. Otherwse ukraine will be part of russia soon.
why dont you care about your own border? this is the usa's next middel east
Need to note down jets can travel long distance so they didn’t need it be close to the border.
This is a horribly destabilizing event, with scary unintended consequences.
All this stroke one man’s ego. What a shame. Russia could've been a great nation, but now it’s just a cold Saudi Arabia, destined to be China’s puppet.
Just wait until Putin's "Soviet Legacy Tour" makes its' stop in Poland.  That's when this gets real.
Low credibility US media on the march….
Well guys it was nice not knowing you, let's avoid each other in the next life as well.
Stop warmongering.
Time to buy some puts
Why die for Danz.... Donbass?
This is 2022 no one invades other countries anymore. That's from another era. Even North Korea isn't that stupid.
Tik tok, the place where you find white girls dancing and internationally relevant military inteligence on military mobilization. I love our timeline so much
The meme of russian guy with fractured hand firing missiles with moskau music playing in the background is about to trend again.
Not logistically possible to take over entire Ukraine. The 2 regions are what they will take over and thats it. Ukraine = 40 MM, Russian troops = 190K ... its peanuts.
Fear mongering
China 🇨🇳 is the future
If we had internet in 20 century maybe it would prevent Stalin and Hitler from starting war🤔
Blame nato!
If Europe let's this happen again all my respect will be gone
This is it.
NO LE COMPREN GAS PETROLEO POR UN TIEMPO SERA UN POCO DIFÍCIL PERO EN UN AÑO  SE MONTA LA INFRAESTRUCTURA Y JAMAS SE LE COMPRARA GAS Y PETROLEO  GOD BLESS YOU OTAN USA 🖖❤
Let's just Pray so that God Can Stop these Nonsense
Let's go Russia 🙌🇷🇺
Oh well. NATO better be ready. Cuz if Putin is ready , trust me , he is ready and has carefully taken into consideration every possible western and European reaction into consideration. Russia and China are gonna take over Europe soon.
"A New Cold War: Global Strategy" how to split apart dictatorships and set them at each others' throats.
This it it boys
Uh oh
