3 months of hell for celtic
Lurgan Flopp manager of the year! 😏
I think, the players,  need to ALL Show (express), that: A, they (all) -want to be here and B, they are Unified/Utd. (United) **and always -putting 100% in (@ all times/games/matches!!)!!**!!
hahaha
We conceded two really poor goals. Both were beautiful goals!  It's just a nonsensical defense!
All i ask for this year is ten n a row neil 💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💚
Until now still some of the fans don’t admit that spl really in deep deep trouble. Celtic win treble but can’t even play well during champions qualifying round. That’s all we can say SPL football standard.
When you try your best but your don’t succeed lol 😂 😂😂😂😂😂
We popcorn teeth blaming the players his tactics in Europe is found wanting
Let's be real, Lennon ain't the man for celtic
Ferencvaros❤❤❤❤❤❤😜 celtic luser HAJRÁ FRADI❤
Neil Lennon is very much like sir Alex Ferguson. The red nose I mean, and fuck all like his managerial skills.
if there are players at are club looking away this historic season then they should never have played for celtic 🍀🍀🍀
David Tunbull 3 million hahahaha
Piss poor management. Piss poor excuses. Piss poor all round.
Trash club
👨‍🌾 league 🚜🚜
What does this result say about the state of Scottish football. If we can get pumped by this mob, what does that say about sevco and the rest of Scottish football.  Lennon will be gone by the end of the season He can’t survive after that.
Looks like the wheels have finally came off celtics gravy train !...Had it far too easy for the past 9 yrs , I can see rangers dominating them this yr as they have more of a settled team than Celtic I hear as many as 6 want out of there
@CelticFC what's happening in this dressing room. As fans who put money in to this club don't leave it quiet. We lost big deal but we might be losing players which ones want to leave which ones wanna go for 10inarow why did Lennon do a Levein.
Lennon proves again what a bad manager he is. Frimpong not on and two striker sitting on their arses. He has molly coddles McGregor too long and should have kicked Griffith out long ago. He plays a pensioner when we have a great defensive midfield holder sitting on the bench (Soro). All world class teams play with a strong back four. A great team has to start with a solid defence yet Lennon goes out and buys extra strikers....madness.  At the end of the day the blame lies with five directors with a total wealth of over 4 Bln. They could easily give the team 50ml a year and not miss it...its pennies to them. They are not true Celtic supporters. You will not have regular group stage participation if your target is buying players for 3-4 Ml. They should be buying players in the 8-10 Ml range and then group stage football would be a certainty. Celtic fans need to wake up and demonstrate to get that sick board out...or force them to spend.
Is he gonna play a goalkeeper at striker next week ?
FTC scoring two poor goals that's a pathetic assessment
What a giggle 😂
Absolutely classic from Lennon, passing the blame. Playing a 4-6-0 whilst 2 perfectly good strikers are sat on the bench for most of the match. No tactical awareness from him whatsoever. Diabolical.
Sort yourself out Lenny
Is the pope went on a 3 week bender stuffed his pockets up way chocolate digestives and dyed his heed ginger
AHAHAHAHAH
Hello hello we are the Billy boys
Farmers.
Hahaha Scottish football, the gift that keeps on giving.
Up the rangers 🇬🇧
Oh dear, never mind.
Never mind......you can all watch your old DVD victories against Barca and City
Shocking,to many players think their bigger than the club,but in the end Lennys to blame. Let's get back to 3 5 2 after all you did have 3 strikers on the bench.
Is it cgi or smth?
Celtic lost to my wi-fi password
Lennon is sevco's best chance for 10 in a row. Celtic have a policy. Buy young, sell on at a profit. They can't therefore complain if a player plays for a few years then wants away. Lennon apparently drinks in the afternoon, is drunk 3 times a week and regularly takes afternoon naps at Parkhead. Why should professional players such as Ajer respect him? Brown can't play so much! He is 35 ffs!
selection was bad last night stubbern no striker i would have started  kamala.lost the match before it even started. few of our Bhoys turned up  struggled at home. compared to ferencvaros whole team turned up solid  unit well drilled. Elhamed was shocking semi pro level Ralston or  Frimpong alot younger Luca and Soro freshen it up a bit . hearing people  saying we alot better with 3-5-2 a and more dangerous cant defend with 4  at the back let alone 3. the last few game is looking like it gonna be a  scrap this season
Small club
Teams are going to sit in against us, Killie, Dundee Utd and now this mob. Tactically naive. Two strikers on the bench until it’s too late. If they don’t adapt I fear for 10IAR. Not good enough by far.
Champions league's shit anyway......
How shit must the other teams be in SPL if this lot win year after year after year?
All lives matter
Does anyone remember when Levine played with no strikers this is not far off 😑😑🤬
Had enough of Lennon! Tactics are shocking! Thought Brenda was bad- but Jesus! Time to go and take lawwell with him
The true banter fc.
Looks like a clown with the red nose

Cool😂😂😂https://youtu.be/ziRhih0lR9Q
CELTIC ALREADY FAILED THEIR 10 IN A ROW🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This guy done the exact same type of mind boggling stunts last season champions league  He has cost the clung around 80-90 million from last year till now  BALLOON, SORRY no excuses eeeegit !
Lennon needs to go and take Brown with him
Shocking performance but the tactics and managing were a shambles. Proof winning the league is easy and hes not a proper manager.
Just watched it back. We actually done quite well but just couldn’t score. The first goal is quality but second is pathetic and defender and goalie should squeeze the chance out. We get a good goal chalked off and hit the bar. Very hard to take but get behind the boys and move on 👍 could be a good reality check.
Red face again and not got a clue how tae win a match well done Lennon 10 in a row will never happen with u as manager  just not smart m8 ur a tit ?
SO WHAT DOES BROON DO MOVE'S OUT THE WAY FOR FIRST GOAL
LENNON'S LOOK PRICELESS PLAY FOR THE BADGE!!! 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/lS0FpAnRUJs
bloke looks like he needs a good nights kip. Looks knackered
I wasn’t surprised at all by the result. Change is needed and I think at management and boardroom level.
He's terrible can only beat wee crap teams in Scotland
The two goals were brilliant. Keep up the great work Neil. If you want 2 blame anyone blame your tight arsed board.
' they would finish top 6 in the PL'    HAHAHHAHAHA
What a noob
An embarrassing mess in europe, now its the 2nd round not even the 3rd or 4th
😂😂😂😂
"more than enough chances in the final third"  just think what could have happened if you'd played a strikker
but come off if 2 srikers aren't fit start with klimala up front give him 45 mins then ajeti atleast try
you can kid yourself on neil, your not kidding the fans on,  the only 2 pass marks was elanoussi and christie, im not going to slate my team on here but  we havent invested with quality again, maybe players once more thats why we are going backwards in europe and dont look great in our own league so far,  i think we must get behind lenny for now, but maybe his lack  of tactics and team shape is showing up now,  hh
All the Judas players at Celtic like money bags Tierney can fuck off away... wrong selection from Lennon but hes right what he says about the players that don't want to be there..id love someone to buy the club and have more ambition for Celtic to achieve more in Europe.. hopefully a good europa run..up d Celtic
HAHA
People laughed and mocked me when I said that rangers were favourites for this season but we have been embarrassing in most of our games! 10 in a row is slipping through our fingers unless we seriously buck up our ideas
Lennon that line up was shite. You don't take teams seriously you get punished for it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a crappy tinpot club Celtic are. They are embarrassing, they're not even the biggest club in Scotland.
Fantastic idea not to play a striker clap clap mate
Never mind Celtic next year perhaps you will not have the misfortune to play a team from the might of Hungarian football
Well-well, Mr. Lennon.  Should have done your research.  Ferencváros are not on the level of St. Mirren, Hibernian, Ross County, Kilmarnock etc - teams you can score 4-5 goals against and everybody celebrates even though in England these would be in League One at best...
I remember wen you had dalglish Johnston Larson in your team it is embarrassing you win the league every season and you carnt get in champions group's stages you need to spend big you sell out crowd at Celtic  park winning  the league doesn't count mutch in Europe it's the fans who suffer most get rid of Lennon most of the players its embarrassing
Iv always backed lennon through thick and thin. ALWAYS. I know him personally. But when I seen that team selection last night before the kick off I was gobsmacked to say the least. Then at halftime, not bringing on the strikers I just couldn't even make up an excuse as to why this was happening. This is lennons fault and he has some explaining to do as to why 10mil worth of strikers warmed the bench the whole game and he went with tactics that have cost us in the past. First time I'm truly upset with lennon and having doubts. Speak up big man and give us all some clarity
Ha ha ha ha ha
They compared themselves to the Lisbon Lions if they made it 10 in a row, they should be ashamed of themselves, they are not fit to wipe the ars-s of the Lions, big Billy will be turning in his grave.
Lennon should be sacked for that shambles,😱 We can’t do that we are going for Ten titles in a row, so there we have it Lennon is saved  of course he will mange the team that will get Ten in a row great  unreal but what’s next eleven twelve .We crave for European football at the highest level ,unfortunately this man is not up to it.
It shouldnt happen lol how's that lyk, absolute garbage
When’s this prick getting the sack never trusted him coming back Absolute fkn joke of a boy
Sorry but before it’s to late let’s get rid of of Lennon he’s pish wee need someone with balls of steel to give us ten in a row
Time for Lennon to go its all very turning up for Lazio but when you playing against these sort of teams should be doing better
I thought Celtic were a big team,Chris Sutton said Celtics reserves were better than Leicester's first team,Just shows how people don't live in reality lmao,Tiny little club in a tiny little league
get in!
“we dominated the game, but.....” = how many times have we said that?...I know europe is a bonus, and the league is what is important...  (if this happens again next year = i think we need to change managers in 2 years time maybe)
💯..some players def have an elevated idea of their ability...no "dig" in certain area's..a very poor show from a lot of them.
Gyere fradi, vedd fel azt a seggét, akit szar rohadék 💚🦅💚🦅💚🦅💚🦅💚 HAJRÁ FERENCVAROS
I wouldn't miss him if he goes his tactics are dire
🤣🤣🤣🤣 What a joke!
I can't believe some of these comments, have u only started watching Celtic? We have had far poorer performances than this. We could have won the game if we put away our chances, simple! James Forrest is homegrown hero and if uv read his book ul read/see 👀 exactly what kind of player he is and what he has done for the hoops. Tonight was not our night and unfortunately we are better suited for Europa League at this time. We are going for 10 and this is what will be remembered in Celtic folklore. Not a an average run in ECL.
Ferencváros players knew head to head in a neutral venue (no fans) that they would win. No fear. More hunger....better players? Squad values : Celtic £80m vs Ferencváros £21m
Why didn't he play klimala? Why is he even at the club? If I was klimala I'd get the fuck out of celtic.... Lennon tactics are a disgrace playing Christie up front when we have a striker on the bench that cost 3million 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
I am from Hungary how u say in English........u got feked ya Fannie's hahahaha
Absolute shambolic stuff of the highest order. The club needs to stop accepting Mickey mouse performances like this and make some serious changes.  I'm getting less confident about the 10IAR by the day. 😏🍀
55 on its way🇬🇧🇬🇧
Celtic Really Are Poor
I’m a rangers fan but even I was absolutely perplexed at Lennon’s team lineup. Not one recognised striker it made no sense to me and he didn’t really react to like the 70th minute. No trolling but kind of got what they deserved with such negative mindset. I’d have been raging if we’d have sent a team out without a forward against anybody
10 in a row? No fukin chance ahaaaaaa
two really poor goals what a disrespectful timmy comment that is the hungarians 1st goal was a beauty and the goalscorer for 2nd left bitton for dead a very skillful goal and he nutmegged the geek lol the only poor of 3 goals in the game was a lucky deflection for celtic goal
😂😂😂giruy 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
At least they won't have to face the likes of Bayern Munich and lose 18-0...🤣
This is what happens when you let a English league one level pub team in the champions league
Lennon reminds me of Strachan keeps picking his favourites.. Time to get ruthless as all fans want 10inar
In all seriousness your problem is that because in the league yous have no challenge you're no ready to step up when you get into Europe
I'm no laughing too much because yous will probably beat us in the league but I'm still having a wee laugh
😂😂😂😂
not good enough at all. 8 million pounds worth of strikers starting on the bench, once again lennon starts with 4 at the back which hasnt worked at all this season but once again lennon goes for it
No striker up front criminal,  James Forrest and ajer playing even more criminal.  A lot of explaining to do Lennon.  Pathetic
Terrible Lennon no excuses you pick the team it's an disgrace
Just embarrassing.
Lennon Gone by Xmas watp
He should have learned lessons from last season , is he the new tinker man ? Should have started with a striker we can’t rely on Eddie every match .
Ur a wanker Lennon well done m8 cup final all over again
Am a rangers fan but Lennon to blame 80% players 20% all starts with squad selection
Disgraceful man. Nae excuses, bringing on a striker when your getting beat is shocking. Should have been on fae the start
Lurgan plopp looks like a junkie 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahahaha out your depth Lennon no got a clue in Europe,  no striker ? Ah well Europa League Celtics level anyway 🤭🤭🇬🇧
Celtic: the champions league should only be for the champions of each league  Also Celtic: get beaten by some hungarian farmers
Love lennon but the buck stops with him with this result! Playing ntcham whos a CM as a no.10 ? Playing Christie whos a 10 as a center forward?? Klimala obviously not trusted so why pay his wages ?
Oh well, only a football game eh.. everyone safe and well? :P
celtic buying shit players, arzani, boli ajeti e.t.c can't expect to win crucial games if you're buying trash.
Terrible defending again we never learn. Need to really sort the defence  out and knucle down cus this is the clubs most important season HH 🍀🇳🇬
The team gave it their all. Lennon is 100% to blame. Starting players who haven't started this season yet. Players all out of position. The better players left on the bench. I was worried when i seen the team selection as were all celtic fans. Why make so many changes in such an important game?????????
We get punished cause your the manager and you dont change anything subs to late players that are not strikers playing .stop playing brown to old and slow 3-5-2 barkas bitton Julien ajier Forrest McGregor Christie ntcham moi eddy ajeti or Griffith's kilmala .theres goals in griff even if he ain't fit still puts one in
pure disgrace last night the 2 changes he made should have happened at half time not at 77mins when we are losing again
People need to stop mentioning him playing Christie up front is af that's the reason we lost, we should have battered this team no matter what team was put out. Players were shocking
He f*cked up the strategy like Ferrari!!
Fielding a team without a striker against a team on paper your much better then.  Then trying to blame the players.  UNBELIEVABLE.
Hahaha get it up yaaaaa 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
The board are to blame as much as Lennon.  They haven't invested anywhere nearly as much as they should and could of.
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Beat by a poor team. Rubbish team selection and tactics. Shved would have ran riot against them.
This reminds me of the 2nd match against Copenhagen. Shocking team selection and not playing our winning formula. Why try fuck about with tactics on such a crucial night for the club? Baffling.
Am a big celtic fan but something is far wrong in the dressing room and it needs fixed asap
The winning goal was effectively a clearance that was so badly defended by Elhamed it led to them scoring,i'm a Celtic fan but this is no coincidence,Copenhagen,Ferencvaros,Cluj,sadly we're at that level,dare i say it even not quite at that level,25m for Mcgregor headlines in the summer,we would be relegated in the english prem.
Throwing players under a bus publicly ? Out of his depth in man management, out of his depth as a football manager, New management required to get control of the playing squad and give the players confidence and belief that they are really playing for a big club, this has been car crash beginning to the 10, time to change driver
Ferencváros deserved the win. Celtic made way too many mistakes and didn't play anything near their best. Lucky for us.
Lennon you’re time is UP.......ANYONE AGREE WITH ME 👐🏻
It was FCKN EMBARRASSING
Wonder what team will put them out the UEFA qualifiers?
very poor team selection...the buck stops with him I'm afraid...so poor!
For the past 3 years in the CL qualifiers we have been put out by a team that aren't as good as us Athens, Cluj, now Ferenvaros including last year in the round of 32 in the europa league shite at home against Copenhagen I'm starting to see a theme.
It shows how bad Scottish football really is.
Questions need to be asked of Lennon after this.
Just saying that Ferencváros played a midfilder up top as well until Boli came in as a sub
Announce the sacking
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Is it not surreal reading all the hun comments this is their only entertainment that says it all really  no won a major trophy in there 8 year history 😂 mind bhoys said it before disappointment is temporary  Liquidation is permanent.  FACT.
Shame and sad...
It's easy for us to put NL and the bhoys down, though when everything is going good we go the other way and start praising them and talking everything up. We are out of the CL now and that's that... Look at the stats from last night's game and Neil is right we were better than the result but that's football and do we all remember 2-1 v Barcelona when they had 75% percent of possession only for Tony Watts to do a number on them for us?.  That's football...!!!! Only thing we can do is get right behind a team that needs our support most now. All the way Celtic 🍀 Keep the Faith  .. Faithful through and through.
Can't even watch this
Hahaha sweet timmy tears 😭 🇬🇧
"We conceded two really poor goals" - WTF Dude? the first one was a great strike from a distance, and at the second one the defender was simply outrun by the striker and put the ball in the goal from an impossible angle. In the contrary, Celtic's goal was a really poor shot ricocheting on a defender and confusing the keeper. Coming up with these kinds of excuses is simply pathetic and not worthy for the captain of a legendary club like Celtic.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 sums up how embarrassing the Scottish league is 3 years in a row you haven’t qualified for champs league 💩💩💩💩💩💩
Fradi best!
Rip celtic xddd
Buy a cdm and a fucking new cb had two strikers on the bench last nyte fs cmon you bhoys in green Sort it out Neil
Lennon is a bum. He’ll be found out big time this year, exposed with no fans giving the team that extra shot in the arm!
Feel bad for Kilmala he has shown good stuff so uncalled for
He's got a ginger bum
Lennon must stay.
Scottish football is a joke. Celtic shouldn't be anywhere near European football.
A correct statement “their not as good as they they think they are” sums it up really
Lenny u set up 2 defend at home in the champions league come on mate we r celtic go out to win we r not as gud as we think and the quality of players we sign are not celtic standard to many players at the club Taylor Julian ajer el hamed Forest  french oily polish pat simply not gud enough and are answer to that david turnball ffs????
Time for Edouard and the others who don't want to be here to get out!
Scottish football is two bald men fighting over a comb.  The quicker the fans demand change the quicker the standard will rise.  Too insular.  Too preoccupied with the past and tradition therefore living in the past.  Scotland you are a wonderful country with magnificent people you deserve better than this.  The powers that be are taking the p*ss out of your passion and loyalty.  If you don’t change the game in Scotland will never change.  You hold the power.
Celtic getting a beating from a small European team.......again! 🤣
😀
In total control of the game. The players that were on the park - Christie, Forrest, Moi, etc are good enough to be putting the ball in the net. They do it often enough domestically from both in and outside the box. The players selected should have finished off that job last night. N’tcham’s effort that comes off the bar goes in and that other rte crumble. It didn’t happen. The second goal of theirs as Lennon says should have been dealt with. Ajeti should be coming off the bench for minutes under his belt at this stage, not trying to save the day. Bolingoli doesn’t help us either - 2 full games behind where we should be in terms of sharpness.
When we will people listen and stop praising Celtic and calling them a “big” club. The Scottish league is an absolute joke. Celtic are the equivalent of a mid table championship team playing in league 2. Bang average players with a bang average manager. The bloke wins titles in Scotland and gets relegated from the championship in England but goes back to Scotland and wins more titles. The league is shit. There is no player in that league who is worth more then £8m. Edouard looks decent but he’s doing what he should be doing in a league like that. No way is he worth 30m.  Celtic need to get out of that league and try get in the championship or league 1 because the spl is embarrassing
It's as if Lennon has started listening to the people who say ntcham should play and just tried to squeeze all 4 of those midfielders onto the park to accommodate ntcham without dropping brown.  I personally think ntcham is lazy, doesn't do enough off the ball on the back foot for me.
Lennon needs to buckle up . He picked the team with no recognised striker....maybe this season wont be so straight forward afterall
Devastating loss but should played alteci up front from the start and also frimpong earlier too he made a huge difference this fervarvous were decent but we should be winning these games celtic should be in the champions league they should change  maybe management next summer and start afresh for champions league qualifier celtic should be in that tournament
Only things worse than team performance was team selection and Lennon interview after it.  Threw el hamed and others under a bus.  Players need to show they want to play for club? They don't want to play for you lennon.
I know celtic fans it hurts but europa league isn't bad. If draw goes right I think you can go far in it. Got a chance to play mr rodgers Leicester now
Ott van bazdmeg!!!!!
As a Hungarian guy, the result is lucky, but shows the lack of respect and scouting on behalf of the Celtic staff. Ferencváros has really only one dangerous attacker, and he was not taken seriously. I dont know this coach, but this was not the direct, fast build-up Celtic Ive anticipated, luckily.
Was like watching an SPFL game.  The chances Celtic created were not good enough essentially because they put out a team that didn’t have specialist playing in and around the box.  Do Celtic not own like six strikers?  Naive setup from management.
LENNY OUT! He Hasn’t got a clue!! Making our club a laughing shambles!! So embarrassed right now to be a Celtic fan!!! We will never be good enough for the ecl simple as that! Get brown out that team right away!
He's no as good as he thinks he is! Quite a few of those chances would have been taken by a striker...if we had one on the park! Right, I'm away  to play snooker without a cue...wonder if i'll win?
Business as usual ........
When we continue to lose in Europe like this then our domestic success looks like it's more down to a poor league, than it does a good Celtic side.   Our last 9 in a row team knew how to cut it in Europe. This wasn't cash rich PSG or Man City tonight, it was a bang average side from Hungary.
Fuckinf disgraceful team lineup. Play klimala!!
RIA RIA HUNGARIA! Ferencváros  ❤️
Barkas should have saved that second goal.  Near post, with a defender harrying the player trying to score, all he has to do is get down drop a leg.
well... the better team won.
Im sad now. The mighty Rangers will have to save Scottish footballs face again. Och well 🇬🇧😂
hahaha delicious fenian tears😍
Team played well in spells but playing no striker is inexcusable when we missed so many chances! Klimala should’ve started. Starting to think only reason we never played a striker is that he won’t drop McGregor for Ntcham!!! Both Elyounossi and Ntcham carried the rest of the team.
We really shouldn't be anywhere near to losing to this type of joke pub side. I'm embarrassed we only beat them by 1 goal.
I no longer have confidence in this man as manager of the club and I think the players are of the same mind they've checked out.He constantly goes on about being unproductive in the final third and he doesn't field a striker?
Does everything but take any personal responsibility. Murmurs something about team selection then goes on a rant about how the players need to buck up their ideas. Do me a favour. I saw plenty of drive tonight from players but no leadership from the manager. Tactically abysmal. Playing a midfielder up front for no discernable reason. Absolutely laughable. The board at Celtic are a disgrace every year they penny pinch, sell big players and buy in poor replacements at a fraction of the price. Tierney for Taylor, jesus you don't get a bigger downgrade than that. They couldn't wait to hire Lennon, a cheap yes man. His appearance is awful. Dressed like a tramp, massively overweight imagine this guy trying to lecture players on work ethic, committment and discipline. Lawell, the board, the manager it all stinks. They've been getting away with this for years. No investment in the team. No ambition. Just milking the fans dry. I wouldn't give the bastards a penny.
Poor goals ???? Ha! U mean shit defence, great goals
I was having a bad day but when i saw this result i felt instantly better!!  Hate bigoted Celtic and Rangers equally
In 6 seasons we have lost ties to inferior teams with vastly lower resources than ourselves at the expense of Legia (before getting reinstated), Maribor, Malmo, AEK Athens, Cluj, Copenhagen, Ferencvaros.  These freak results should be happening at most once a decade & instead they're happening practically EVERY SEASON!
Lennons lost the plot
HaHaHa
Klimala ran past me THREE times tonight warming up !! But naw instead we start a CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUALIFIER with ONEEE opportunity to win it with a fucking midfielder upfront ?? Fair enough he scored but it was a deflection , We’re paying klimala thousands a week and soon to be Ajeti thousands a week for them both to apparently be unfit .... What so your telling me TWO professional football players aren’t even fit enough to play 45 minutes that’s why Ajeti got 15 poxy minutes instead , Most important season of all time and this is how we start it off😂😂
Lennon out
Hajrá Fradi!
Celtic played good but you didn't realise your chances. Ferencvaros relaised their chances and that'd why Celtic is out. You don't need to be angry or something else. I believe that Celtic will be very good in Europa League like last year. Heads up boys and see you in round of 32 of Europa League. From Red Star Belgrade fan! 🇷🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🔴⚪🍀🍀
Lenny to blame for poor team selection, no urgency from players to get out at first goal, Ajer has to be who Lennon is talking about for leaving as he was at fault for first goal, barely jogged out. Second goal barkas could have stayed on his line, there was no threat if he had done that. All in all not a big surprise from celtic, that is our level, capable of a big scalp on occasion, capable of being defeated by also rans also on occasion. The reality is we would have struggled in the 3rd round and struggled in the play off and would have been pumped in the champs league proper.
Lenny is right thou, some players do need to buckle up and realise they’re performances recently has been unacceptable. If you don’t wanna be here, don’t wanna play for the badge no more then fuck off if the shirt is getting too heavy. 🍀🇮🇪
Perhaps if bolingoli hadnt caused the players to miss 3 games yohs might have been sharper eh...
😂😂😂💩🇬🇧🇬🇧
Ferencváros AND Celtic fan here. When we got together I was was buzzing really, was a dream come true. I don't even know what can I say right now. This evening has to be our biggest upset since we beat Liverpool in 1974.  Wishing all the best for the 10 in a row and hope we both of us get into our respective group stages!
Why does this season look set up to be a big big disappointment
Zero defence, no excuse for that Mr Lawwell and the Tory board it's plagued us for years.
It won't happen this year obviously even though it perhaps should, but after this season Lennon has to go. There's lots of top, young coaches out there who'd love to manage Celtic. And even if that weren't the case, give Jack Ross at Hibs a chance.
Utterly shameful performance, very worrying.
Leave mate
Looks like Messi won't be signing 😡
fucking shocking, but don't worry we will go out n batter Motherwell on Sunday!..... Absolute bangers!!
Marvellous. I can hear the creaking loud and clear. A fantastic shambles that cheered me up no end. Well done Lenny.
If ed leaves we wont win league, we need to sign a striker NOW
The amount of momey celtic fans have pumoed into the club and we have to watch that dross
Not fucking good enough
Groundhog Day..
Yes it was a terrible result but come on guys let’s keep the heads up and not get too negative over 1 silly result.  We controlled the game and at times played some lovely stuff, had a legitimate goal ruled out as Mo was not offside, Olivier hit the bar n we bombarded 29 attempts.  At the end of the day we are not a champions league club anymore (nor are the other lot who have no trophies) and if sacrificing champions league and europa league for that matter means we go on to win the ten then I know we would all snap the hands off that offer.  So keep the faith guys, in Lenny we trust because the poor team selection tonight does not make him a poor manager.  Lenny started n will finish the 10.  Mon the hoops n ‘o the Rangers are shite’ ‘have u ever seen Gerrard win the league’
Celtic don't like playing in the champions League qualifiers  put them straight nto the final
Hahahahahahah take that pedo patrol
It's really hard not to laugh at this girning, whey faced loser.  He was a whinging cheat as a player and he's a whinging cheat as a manager.  And a loser.
Something needs to change at the club ASAP not just for 10IAR - but for the future standing of our clubs place in Europe and the game in general.
Small club playing in a farmers league what a surprise hahahahaha
First goal brown  ran away from fella  shooting it was inexcusable I couldn't believe what I was watching I had to go for walk after it to clear my head
Please stay neil
It seems to me that Lennon and previous managers are feart to drop players such as Brown and Forrest in case they face a backlash. It’s bullying in a way. But if these players cost you time and again, what’s the alternative? Scott Brown’s legs have been gone for about 5 years and he’s still first pick. If a manager is bawless then he’s always destined to fail. Nah, no for me. I’m checking out. Europe should be the only thing that matters to club like Celtic.
Congratulations Ferencvaros from Ireland & thank you.
Kimala 3.5millions centrr forward sitting on the bench REALLY mate
Celtic are good at beating low level teams but as soon as they play a half decent side they get exposed
Celtic is a great name, a great club, but actually not better football team, than Ferencváros. Best wishes from Hungary and good luck in EL ! And thanx... ;-)
Champions League stadium, champions League fans, champions League wages n transfer fees but bunch of underperforming players and manager, sick of it now..!!
The best team in Scotland is worse than a team no one's ever heard of
Get that idiot out!!!
Can anyone else see that James Forrest is stealing his wages empty jersey him
Scottish football is a joke. A championship club would've given ferencvaros a better game
Gang mentality to distract u from how shit ur life is, then pay for a season book, but can’t get in 🤥🧐, then get put out a Europe and you’ve paid for rangers to laugh at u 🙄
Came on Celtic you can do better then this pull your socks up play for the team big Season Ahead we want to win 10 in a Row not going to win the League playing like that
Not Neil Lennon - he's Fail Lennon.
Directors still saving money in 10 in a row season shows all you mugs who pay a season book you’re a farmed animal
not amused
Lennon has done that because Celtic is getting run like a business off higher powers and he’d much rather griffiths wasn’t a prick and got 2 lesser strikers while he got fat and went awol!!!! Lennon is obv saying he don’t have a choice in signings or he’d av played them , embarrassing all the same
Start klimala for the love of God what has the boy have to do for a chance hes shown he can do the job
Wow
There is so much I wanna type but I'm no giving the Currants amo but I could go full on Lebanon right now
Hahahahahah Neil must stay. Hahahha fuking ginger heed
Maybe it’s time for you to step down. Last year the Romanians, this one the Hungarians. What’s next? Moldova?
Pure and simply embarrassing...!!
Another Kopenhagen like humiliation, another suicidal tactic. Celtic shouldn't wait no longer and sack this guy imediately. 2 shots on target, 2 goals... Ferencvaros 4 actions in whole game Celtic : 25 actions - 7 shots on target - 1 goal...
I guess Ferencvaros were Hungar-ier than Celtic, is that you lot oot ay the Champions league already,  🤫😂🤣 better get that defence fixed up quick sharp, the way rangers are attacking right now, that defence will get ripped wide open 🙃🤫😂
Neil done a Craig Levein with the 4-6-0 formation. Absolute wagon. Why not play Klimala for 45 mins and Ajeti for 45 mins ? He's full of shit. Honestly, Lemon thinks he is Pep Guardiolla and got found out again. Celtic fc have a massive narcissistic issue from top to bottom and it constantly bites them. They think they are way superior than what they really are. In the main as soon as a half decent non domestic opposition is presented they struggle. The sooner they learn to be humble and realistic and the fans focus on their own club instead of consuming themselves with attacking and demonising Rangers the better it'll be for Celtic, and these moments will be less frequent.
Haha just when Scottish football couldn’t be more of a joke. Celtic are not an English premier league standard team so get those delusions out your head. You’re a lower championship team at best
The 7 P's...Piss poor planning produced piss poor performance.
Embarrassment. Inept. Utter pish.
Pack your bags!! you have NO clue
#LennonOut
Not good enough same old story groundhog day again if players want to leave then  fk them seriously peeved tonight
❤️🇭🇺
1st and foremost wrong team selection
Just sack him now its a sacking offence it was tactical suicide and not for the first time. Hope he just walks away instead of the embarrassment of being booted out the door. We've been going back the way under lennon and tonight was just to far
😂😂😂
Terrible performance . Wrong team picked again and I'm fast losing patience as we never learn from our mistakes.  Throwing players under the bus is not a good move either
Proved once and for all hes not good enough for Europe blaming the players for his choices
Know stickers 2 sitting on the bench anyway fuck their no surrender
We are the home team also the favourites and we don’t start with a striker. What exactly is going through neil’s mind, it’s the same bullshit every year
I know what happened! Mr. Lennon unsuccessfully invented the brand new 3-7-0 formation.
Simple question, would a good manager have started without a striker and played 75 minutes without a striker?? Lenny trying to show off his creativity. I'm not jumping off the bandwagon, I have said it since the start. We need a top class manger.   We went from Brendan Rogers to this.
Imagine buying 2 strikers over the summer and then not fucking playing any
I see people singing about 10 in a row... Why? Why celebrate 10 worthless titles? I know the first few would have been great, free wins and all that but Celtic fans still cheer like Celtic is amazing...   The hard truth is that even when Rangers were winning the league year after year that 2nd place Celtic would shatter this current side... That Celtic team didn't have even 3 in a row but they were superior to this side yet we chant 10 in a row! Is this what you are happy with? A guaranteed league win every season getting beat by teams that simply shouldn't be able to compete? Scottish football has admittedly always been rather shite, but after Rangers fell it's like it's taken Celtic also, nothing left to right for really do why try?
Honestly though..should any of us really be surprised? Our defence is horrific,  What the f***  do they do on the training field!
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Walk away ya clown  poorpoorpoor
Since when is passing the ball side to side to side to backward pass dominating a game? Shooting from 50 yards out so it boosts our shooting stats! Brutal corner after brutal corner from christie, shocking set pieces, trying to flick in goals! Forrester an empty jersey yet again, heart of a mouse.  Callum mac, what happened to the lad! Not scoring, not creating, completely ineffectual.  We all see brown needs rested.   But how on gods green earth can Celtic football club go into a home tie, to progress in the champions league with the prospect of making £30m, and not have a single striker on the pitch.  Not only that, didn’t bring one on until the 80th minute. That is unforgivable management from Lennon and Kennedy.
Right people, I’m gonna try something new. Don’t even know why I bother but I’m gonna do another top 5 list, with a twist. Rather than players from a specific position, it will be my ‘Top 5 managers to replace Neil Lennon’. Too late tonight but I’ll do it tomorrow. If anyone is interested leave a comment on this and I’ll reply tomorrow once I’ve done it so you get a notification and don’t miss out. I’ll post it on the club’s official page whenever they release their next video of course so you’ll see it there too!
Who's to blame my list: Lennon for that dire selection hasn't learned from culj and the league cup from last season hopeless and not  surprised because you knew what was going to happen I know we would lose  Lawwell for not spending on the  areas that need investment 10 million is not enough we more and get a cb lb rm lm cm of actual affordable quality not projects  Taylor is pish not Celtic class and  never goes past the opposite full back he is up against get him to fuck Brown is very too old and proved it today gutless display has no right to be that team every week  Brown and Taylor not closing the guy down for the first goal  Elhamad for the second goal horrendous and costly  Ajeti and Paddy on the bench both strikers Lennon doesn't play them because he is thick  Ajeti on at 75 mins far too late embarrassing should have been earlier  Subs coming too late from Lennon happens far too often and is beyond a job now  Forrest turns in mystic Meg not the first time  Wasting our chances and it haunted us  Edouard is going why didn't Lennon lie and say he is injured not true the board are selling him to Aston Villa because they are clowns and want to open a hotel and laugh at the fans  What needs to happen now:  Get rid of Lawwell Lennon the board and the players who are not good enough 10 in a row won't happen because of these guys this season is going to a diaster and I won't be sympathetic or surprised fuming rant over
Just seen Lennon, criticizes the team and they can leave if they want, this coming from the idiot who played a midfielder as a striker, I expected this crap from Gerard, at least he has a decent excuse, his team are poor, not the kind of response I expect from our squad!!!
Small, irrelevant club north of England
FRADI💚💚💚
Congratulation Ferencvaros!
Wee lenny doing a slippy g  trying to distance himself of blame by throwing his players under same bus. No recognised strikers,  disrespecting his opponents, no easy games in Europe, team selection disgrace, sorry but lenny to blame for exit out of Europe, not helped by dam board with no ambition , still think team good enough for 10th title  , but now laughing stock of Europe, that goes for other Scottish teams to , gone are the days , when wee used to compete, money men running game now , making sure English teams get into Europe even when they haven't won there own league total joke , time fans stood up made point , corruption ruining best sport on the planet, and fans don't have say , but have to put up with , respect your fans world wide and stop taken them for granted , shame on FIFA and other world football bodies,  but the games nothing without hard paying fans around the world. 😶🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪
No forward on the pitch and 4 at the back with brown and mcgregor in CDM roles. Tempo is like playing in mud. Slow, boring, and predictable. Happy no fans there to see that shite
At least he gave an interview. You can’t say with our form and team selection this hasn’t been coming. Very disappointing and maybe a wee wake up call
Home advantaged!!! Let’s play a midfielder upfront  And keep £10 million pounds worth of strikers on the bench........ Mmmmm sorry Neil, WHY ARE YOU A MANAGER!!!!
FERENCVÁROS❤🇭🇺❤
Stop blaming the players. Your playing 1 up front against part timers and even Rangers.... Sort it fuckin out Neil! We are the big team not them! Let them worry about our attack!!!
I was listening to comments like if we had a quality striker we would have one; well what about defending?  I don't blame Lenny (totally) but he needs to understand no more make-shift srtikers or defenders. If you don't think Klimala is good enough , then sell him but don't play Christie instead . Looks like the Pole has worked his arse off to play CF. I blame Lawwell and the future planning at Cektic, we need to plan to be ready to play games in July, August otherwise let's admit our ambition is Europa League.
That’s him starting on the players now needs to look at his own decisions playing people out of position can’t tell when players aren’t playing well , ie brown / Forrest &Taylor always makes subs to late in games & his tactics are predictable never learn think we need a change before the 10 is out of reach sorry to say. Raging tonight
im buzzing 🇬🇧
He’s a gers fan at heart and almost completed his mission just take the rest of you’re players on holiday I hear Spain is lovely this time of year Neil at least you’ll have an excuse for when we win the league you’ll never get 9 iar
So Europa league?
God save the queen
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Celtic pumped out of Champions League three days after the competition ends- FACT Lennon turns on his players- FACT Lennon doesn't play recognised strikers- FACT Scotland's shame? - FACT Ireland's shame- FACT. Although most Irish people don't give a fuck about Celtic and support either Man Utd or Liverpool. - Scottish government shut down their proposed fan attendance game- FACT - Celtic have lost out on at least  £10m today- FACT Celtic deny knowledge of paedophile ring operating for decades under the tutelage of several Celtic coaches- FACT Most Celtic fans haven't seen their own feet in over 5 years- FACT
We dominated the game? We got tactically played for 90 mins, them letting us have the ball is not dominating the game... We had loads of chances? For the second game running we did not make 1 clear chance against part time opposition. Hitting a bunch of low percentage shots is not creating chances. The players are following your lead Lennon, out drinking 4 night a week, coming back from lockdown 5 stone overweight. You have undone all Rodgers work in creating a professional culture. Your team selections are astonishing in that when you think it cant get any worse, you go and produce Christie up front with 2 strikers on the bench. We deserve better than you, we deserve a manager who can drop scott brown to the cheerleader role he warrants. Im so sick of Celtic with you in charge, do the right thing and resign.
Fucking embrassing shocking shocking shocking
Look at that nose😂 probably the stella giving him that yellow brick road in his mouth anaw
Hahaha bloody brilliant 👏 🤣 😄 👌 😆
Yea let’s have a good choice of strikers keeping a seat warm and put a midfielder up front, that’s what ud expect from Craig levine the 6 4 0 specialist. Farcical to have no striker.
Abysmal team selection and tactics.
Kieran Tierney sold, what do The board expect. Too man soft players,. It's not the fans fault, if you got 4 chap's outa THE BRAZEN HEAD at closing time they would defend batter than that.
Its his own fault fuck about with team again and you don't get away with it in Europe
WATP 55 🇬🇧 coming 😂
That was a very poor interview by lenny... no confindence🙈
He is terrible. Just sack him and get somebody in that’s better
Griffiths not fit Big Eddy not fit & the new guy not up to speed it was always gonna be hard, we needed our other attacking players to step up to the plate . . . it didn't happen so move on stay positive, look forward to the good things that could be :) One thing I really don't get is why we can't have some fans at the game, surely we could have at least a few thousand, if they wear gloves and masks where the problem?
Fkn shocking
Got beaten by Hungarian plumbers
I can't decide if Celtic are Scotland's shame or Irelands shame? All that effort to finish a league they hadn't even won yet just to get their dirty rancid paws on Champions League money that now will never come. That is one of the beautiful things about football: karma will fucking get ya. Tramps.
Ferencvaros 🔥🇭🇺😎
I'm hurting right now also. I only give 2 Fcks about securing 10 in a row this year. I can't understand why he didn't play a centre forward tonight. Doesn't make FCK ALL sense.  Anytime we get into the UCL it's an absolute bonus because we ain't a UCL team and is much as that pains me to say that it's the fckn truth. So we go again in the Europa League and focus on the 10 in a row.  I've been going to Celtic Park now for over 40 years and I followed Celtic when it was the fckn Kelly's that owned us. I seen Celtic win the double in 88 and then we lifted the Scottish Cup in 89 and I never seen Celtic lift a trophy until 95. Back in those barren days I couldn't imagine Celtic winning 9 league and umpteen  trebles in a row.  We will get ourselves on a winning run again that's for sure. Neil Lennon is a great manager in my opinion. Wasn't that long ago he took us 2 the last 16  of the UCL. Neil Lennon is Celtic daft like all of us and I'm backing him 100%.  Personally I think Celtic have found it difficult without us the FANS there to roar them on.  At the end of the day I'm CELTIC TILL I DIE 💚💛💚💛💚
Bad performance bad choice of players how do you explain that one
These bad team performances are becoming the norm , the quality needed for a successful season just isn’t there anymore, their goalie wasn’t under much pressure at all, the Celtic goal took a lucky deflection , why buy strikers and not play them 🤦 and it looks like any strong fast forward can penetrate our back line too easily , weeks ago every Celtic fan knew where the team weaknesses were and absolutely nothing was done in time to ease through the qualifiers by management, the overall complacent attitude of the club is shockingly poor considering they have the best fans in the world who deserve better.
Same shite every year take an eternity to sign players & fail to qualify then bring players in to quell the fans anger! Reactive rather than being proactive which is clearly not good enough again!
this will be all sweeped under the carpet till next season. last season it was mcgregor playing left back this season playing a midfielder as striker. Just scunnered with this
Hope.  Lennon.      Keeps his job.       He’s a top manager.   Guys
He sounds like a man with a lack of ideas wtf
John Abraham is a dobber
To be realistic about it Bugs Bunny could have manged Celtic over the last few years and they would have still have won nine in a row taking into account the calibre of the opposition, Europe is a different story and this is when Celtic get caught out because they don't raise their game enough to deal with the change of pace and style of European clubs.
Rangers man here....watched tou part timers tonight and enjoyed every last minute of it 😂😂😂😂
That’s tough to take
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm a gers fan and to see you lot getting humped by that lot and playing no strikers it's honestly the best night for years I'm no stop laughing hahahaha 😂😉
Got a home draw in both 1 off ties against sides no better than the likes of Hibs or Aberdeen IMO.   Genuinely thought Celtic would win comfortably to help boost Coefficient again.  With wage bill relying on Champions league football as they have shown by selling Dembele then Tierney past 2 seasons AFTER not making group stages if French Eddy stays you can guarantee Rogic & Ntcham will be sold off to balance books. Club have made £5-10m profit AFTER taking in £20m and £25m respectively just read the accounts published at AGM. Massive blow for their squad this season
At the end of the day or night,  it’s just your standard issue out on yer arse Champions league qualifier night at parkhead. Charlie Nicholas is just sitting there thinking 🤔 why did we not play a striker when we had 2 on the bench.  Dearly me
need to get rid of the, "we win...not for second best"..it's embarrassing, it's just  asking for a 2nd place finish this year
Told everyone Gary Mackay-Steven would be shite ✅ Told everyone Jack Hendry would be shite ✅ Told everyone Scott Allan would be shite ✅ Told everyone Cristian Gamboa would be shite ✅ Told everyone Scott Bain would be shite ✅ Told everyone Marvin Compper would be shite ✅ Told everyone Jeremy Toljan would be shite ✅  Told everyone Moritz Bauer would be shite ✅ Told everyone Oliver Burke would be shite ✅  Told everyone Lewis Morgan would be shite ✅ Told everyone Greg Taylor would be shite ✅  Told everyone Patryk Klimala would be shite ✅   Told everyone Moussa Dembélé was gonna be a God ✅ (backed him to the hills when so many people didn't have a clue who he was and when they got on his back after a reasonably slow start. Then when everyone called him a rat for leaving I went and bought a signed top of him because I loved him so much. Now everyone loves him again now he's doing well...)  Commented on Celtic's video's telling them to sign Erling Haaland during his Molde days when he put 3 past Hibs in a European qualifier ✅ (he's doing not bad now...)   Yet nobody listens to me. EVER. Celtic's scouts will be getting paid an absolute fortune to sign players. Yet I do it as a hobby in my spare time and I'm FAR superior than them at it and I don't even get f***ing paid for it!!!!!! Celtic should hire me for one season. I'd work for free for the first season and show Celtic what I could do. If I flopped (which I wouldn't) then it would cost them nothing and I'd never comment again. On the other hand when I turned out to be the next John Park Celtic would have made the best piece of business they've ever done!
im a rangers fan and obviously not lennons biggest fan , but i admire his honestly .. a shocking result there , up there with Rangers v progres .... your keeper looks terrible , big FF would have saved them both ...hopefully give you’s a good challenge this season ..
oh dear how sad, never mind !!
LENNON OUT
Best Wednesday Iv had for a long time 😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
#lennonout
Is that your only input Neil? C'mon. You've lost it. You picked that baffling selection and farted about for too long, FAR TOO LATE! Same at Tannadice and i won't even mention Rugby Park. Do the right thing. And take Taylor with you.
Anyone think he threw this game for ten in a row? Food for thought.
Looks like the dressing rooms all over the place, not a good sign this early on, we're fuckin struggling. Also, if Frimpong starts we don't lose that first goal, he also done more than Forrest done when he came on, that's Lenny's fault.
Edouard will be off to villa before the start of the premier league, every year celtic miss qualification a big player us sold to subsidise the loss of champions league money, the Adidas kit deal is also now worth less as it was heavily incentivised on champions league participation...poor show
oh dear.................but u wanted lennon back......blame yersels....
Lenny's Craig Levin moment with no striker. Absolutely disgraceful.
Lennon talking pure shite your attitude towards that team tonight thinking it was a gimmie was shocking u picked the team and your no as good a manager as u think you are that was embarrassing and no excuses
Lennon out now...!  Should be chased down London Road for this...at least no 7-0 beatings this season...
Lennin out! Had enough if his daft arse ideas!
He's a disgrace!!!! Total embarrassment, overrated, we should get rid of him, we already had a poor start in the league and I fear the worst. We've loaned out shved, and bayo is away,...why lennon never gave them a run of games? And his side to side passing game is boring as f×××. Defo a step back since Rodgers left, gutted
The opposing team had under 30% possession throughout the game you actually kidding me??  Hope with all these ridiculous results in football lately the bookies go broke
“Players need to buckle up” says the man who benched two strikers and starts an AM up front
The Green Levein 😂
Any other club the size of Celtic and their manager would be gone after costing the club near £100m with embarrassing defeats to Cluj, Copenhagen and now Ferencvárosi. Not Lennon and Celtic though. Don't worry we'll go out and batter Motherwell senseless on Sunday and all will be forgotten about and Lennon will be the hero again.
Wow, throw your players under the bus much, although tbf they deserve it. Millions spent on strikers both left on the bench, fuckin joke. Same shite every year don’t even know why I’m surprised. Surely can’t get any worse eh. lol watch this fuckin space 😂
Learn from this Neil.. Work on your shape and selection ☘️
This is why we don’t deserve to be in the premier league. What an awful performance again in Europe!
Don’t want to hear it Rudolph
No striker! Putting players out of position!!! YOUR TO BLAME NEIL FS
Same old story underestimating opponents and experimenting with tactics and formations in crucial games. Playing a 1 leg match with a centre mid up front and 7M worth of strikers on the bench is beyond a joke. Lenny dosent have as much love for this club as much as the fans and the game was lost before it started tonight with that game plan
Not like we going to win the champions league
Fringpong went past more players in twenty minutes than Forrest has went past in two years, cuts back every time he is not an attacking player anymore he is a waist of a jersey get him out our team, less of the pals act Lennon , i get you managed him when he was a kid but enough is enough, if he doesnt want to attack get someone who will ffs
Not good enough lennon heard all this rubbish before
Lennon take the blame bad decision to play with no forward done it twice last year and nearly fucked it up you bought Klimala he has had a preseason and he doesn’t get a game a joke
Sorry Lenny. It's you who isn't as good as you think you are. Awful decisions tonight & you have failed to improve some glaring aspects. Whenever we lose the ball no matter the opposition. They are either having a shot or we are getting lucky with some desperate defending. We have to be the worst team in the history of throw ins. It's a disadvantage when we win one. We played a side tonight who were far from match fit. Yet the excuse to keep 9mil of strikers on the bench was both not being fit? Lenny was a great player & has been a tremendous servant to the club. Tonight he made some unforgivable mistakes. On top of this he compounds them with his post match comments. It's time to go Lenny you are on of your depth.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’ve still got faith in Lenny.  🍀
4-6-0 formation. What an advert for the game. Coaching career over
Needs to go.  Not good enough we haven’t improved since the rat left.
Lawd u do da me celtic!!!!!!
Celtic always flop in champions league and Europe competitions
The board are to blame. Penny pinching fuckers. Always dragging their heels regarding investment in team. Always the same. Especially this season. Every time I see lawwels face I see a big smug pound sign. Shameful
Absolute shambles! Terrible defending poor team selection, and scott brown shouldn't be anywhere near first 11!
Putting some strikers on the pitch would help , not one centre forward or striker on the pitch an absolute joke and pissed off hearing the same old shite , Where are all our forwards and strikers we have ? ..... totally took the team for granted .... Eduard now gone
Unforgivable Celtic! £700 out of pocket for a season ticket to sit on my couch at home and merch to wear in the house to watch a toothless performance !!!  Playing without a striker is inept! Carbon copy of Cluj!!! We need to shake things up from board level to manager and players! If we don’t start reinvesting in proven players before the season and ucl qualifiers, I for one will be permanently supporting my club from home and you won’t be getting one copper penny from me in future! We have backed the team more than ever, season tickets sold out for an empty stadium and this is the dross we need to watch! Big changes needed!!!
do the honourable thing neil  and resign shambles not playing a striker in a must win, how you manage o mess that team up even he keeper is awful. your advice is buckle up ye well done going nowhere fast slow pace no urgency or tempo no ideas its been the same in every match this is all on you and yove passed the buck again
Every single pass that f*cking muppet Taylor made was backwards. Ntcham was on the left wing once and managed to beat a man on his first and only attempt FFS!! (50th minute) Greg Taylor had an entire 90+ minutes to do it and he couldn’t even do it ONCE!! But oh no, I’m wrong, I’m the hun, I’m the problem for not accepting mediocre players at this club. ANYONE who argued with me that Taylor is good enough has ZERO right to complain about this result tonight. ZERO. It’s people like you who accept theses bang average players that allow results like this to happen!!!!
I can't believe all the nonsense being said here. Its very very disappointing but its gone. So lets settle for a better run in the Europa this year and a league title.
Europe’s punch bags again
Rule Britannia!  🇬🇧 😄
Utter joke. Pathetic. No strikers. Undroppable players. Don't blame El Hamed.
Lennon throwing the players under the bus with they comments,you have two strikers on the bench yet you play a midfielder up front,Klimala is not the greatest but could run there defenders about for an hour obviously no trust in the boy.We looked great last season playing with 3 at the back until we played Copenhagen ,now this season we have gone back to playing 4 at the back and 1 up top just poor and slow .we knew what the qualifying was all about this season but yet again we drag our heels bringing players in ,now we will probably lose our best player to make up the money lost from getting knocked out tonight.Sorry about this rant but people have to answer for this after all they took our money for season tickets and we have nothing in way of transfers on the pitch tonight until Ajeti comes on.Aaarrrghhh.
Absolute garbage. Team and manager should be ashamed.
Lenon your to blame no striker your ment to be going forward not back same old
Got what we deserved tonight, the recruitment has been poor over the past few seasons, little competition in key positions in the team.
Forget europe a no is a bad won but league the one
*I'M ABSOLUTELY LIVID* 😡😡😡😡
No striker against this mob, absolutely shocking.
GREG. TAYLOR. OUT.
I am a massive celtic fan and the team sesection was poor
I have to say one thing Elyounoussi was brilliant. Should sign him if edouard leaves🍀🍀
My god man how many chances did we hhave tonight and why did we not have a st on the pitch
Give us a break Neill man. Point all the fingers you like, you set them up to fail by fielding a team without a striker
Absolutely fed up now. Lennon’s clueless, the scouting’s been ABYSMAL, and the board are business men, not football men. Sick and tired of putting up signing suggestions and people telling me I’m wrong and know nothing. Yet I told everyone Greg Taylor wasn’t good enough (got hammered for that), told everyone Klimala wasn’t worth anywhere near £3.5m (got hammered for that) and that’s without mention Lewis Morgan, Jack Hendry, Jeremy Toljan, Mauritz Bauer, Scott Bain, Oliver Burke, Vakoun Bayo, Marvin Compper etc etc. To think everyone in that scouting department will be getting paid an absolute FORTUNE to do something I could do 100x better and for a fraction of the price!!!! Absolutely fed up man.
Neil, we love who you are but it’s been clear as day from the start of the season that you cannot motivate this team any longer. They don’t believe in you and your tactics. Your team selection was dreadful, I have never seen a Celtic team play with no strikers when there are 2 on the bench. Inexcusable and I think your time is up. This is not jumping on the bandwagon, I genuinely feel he doesn’t have what it takes to manage Celtic any longer.
Unfortunately, I now firmly believe Celtic's level is Europa League at best. Toothless performance once again in a European competition at home and really don't deserve to be at the top table. Ferencváros did what they needed to do and congratulations to them. Possession is nothing without conversion.
Well you can’t polish a turd can you lol
Scotland. Finest. Nine. In. A. Row.. Aye.. Oot. Of. Champs. League. 9.iyears.in.a.row.baw.heid.broon.in.kentys.pocket.
Can't see celtic doing 10 rangers by far look like the stronger side celtic look shit
Can't help but feel thatLenny is caught up in a ground hog day scenario with the board limiting his true vision for Celtic. But more importantly (and maybe because of this "celtic board scene)" Lenny has been looking and sounding a bit disheveled... for want of a better term...Keep well Lenny we love you but you'e sake is more important
Get a grip Celtic, c’mon🍀
As quick as lennon got the job after winning the scottish cup, id be happy to see him leave just as quck after he clinches 10 in a row...which btw HE WILL DO!
Fkn hilarious 😂😂😂
Delete this channel please x
Pish.
He says ajeti no fit enough to play 90 mins okay fair but you’ve got another striker on the pitch that can play there a do a better job than anyone else that he puts there. Honestly fukin shocking team selections just shows that without eduard we will barely score goals
Pull yer finger out lennon
Poor piss listening to excuses from Lennon no head for Europe think Lennon time is up.
Don't take your chances and you get punished at this level. It's all very well blaming Lennon for strikers and all this but  if El Hamed had headered the ball away people would be saying we played quite well. Unfortunately Europe is a very high level even at this stage and filled with champions of countries bigger than ours. I think people that follow the access lists realise Celtic have probably played their last Champions League group campaign but going out this early makes qualifying for even the Europa a tough ask. Obviously the league is the priority but group stage football is important financially and to try and keep our top players. Good luck to Ferencvaros, good team defensively.
Think we need a more tactically astute manager Lennon doesn’t cut it for me  he’s trying to blame the players attitude but it was him who didn’t start the game with a striker & we have never played well with brown/ ntcham & calmac in MF he needs to stop being a puppet for the board
“Lennon knows how to get a result in Europe”. Gets tactically outclassed by Cluj, Copenhagen and Ferencvaros. Gies peace ffs
Why are we paying Klimalas wages if we're not gonna play him in such circumstances? I mean seriously, we had no strikers and still, he didn't play him. What's the point in having him at the club? why are we spending money on professional bench warmers? wtf is going on?
Lennon's to blame for team selection but this goes deeper. The PLC have mugged us off for years telling us ten in a row is the golden goose while we constantly get embarrassed in Europe by what were once minnows.
Tbh i think he ment it just to focus on the 10iar and the quadruple treble
Lenny to blame imo
I think Lenny is alluding to some players who don't want to be there. Without mentioning them by name
We bought a striker ajeti then you go play a centre mid up front
Hahahaha pub team
Ho ho ho merry Christmas could nt have happened to better club!!!
Raging the now really struggled to find money to renew season ticket prob like many this season and this is my reward no fit for purpose Neil, sorry but got to be said.
Having the ball doesnt equal having chances, Neil! Wake up TikiTake is OVER! Absolute disgrace. There is no excuse. Don't even care about 10 in a row. It's not worth a thing in such a mediocre league. Love Celtic since I was born. Broken heart every August.
Disgraceful . Bring in Martin O'Neill before It's too late . Lennon has lost the dressing room . Also , he has zero tactical awareness . His team selection tonight was baffling to say the least . To add insult to injury , Eduaord didn't want to stay at Celtic prior to the match ,- now he will be gagging for the exit door . Embarrassed in Europe once again , and unless things improve rapidly , we can kiss cheerio to ten in a row .
Lennon the was shit need tae look 👀 it yourself m8  play a 3 /5/2 arsehole m8 🇮🇪💚😡💪
Who doesn't play a striker when you have 2 on the bench. Don't let the door hit you on the way out
Fucking crap NL and the board need to have a good think about 10 IAR before they mess that up the board did the same when Martin O'Neil left had a great team and fucked it up doing things on the cheap BRING IN THE RIGHT MEN FOR THE JOB
Come  on  my  CELTIC   fc  for  life
It's always difficult playing these smalls teams. I had never heard of them. I did a Google search and apparently they play in a pub league in Scotland.
I don’t mind getting fucked my PSG or Barca but all them wee teams it’s to much Lennon is not the man and the assistant managers aren’t it ever let’s hope lester sack BR and we can some how get time back that’s all I can see for the good of our club
LOL...
Cheers Lenny there’s another hole in ma wall
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol
Another massive underachievement from Celtic. Last year lennon messed up but got another chance. He’s now messed up again. Big European games and he can’t do it. Time is up for me, I could win domestic trophies with this team. With no champions league football will players now want to leave? crap again Celtic
Get rid of christy and Julian get duffy and benkovic plus melling from rosenbourg
We are fucking shocking so far this season. Fragile at the back. Toothless up front. Needs to sort this shit out.   Why are we spending all this money on strikers and then not even playing them when Eddie is injured. Klimala must be at his fucking wits end. What does he need to do to get a start. Give the guy a chance.   Seriously.... If eddy goes this season.. we are fucked
Im a celtic fan. And don't want the team i love being gubbed 10 fuckin 1 on agg in the CL.. But obviously it doesn't fucking bother the board.. In my 50 years supporting Celtic i have never taken a penny out the club just put money in... Lawell and the rest can get tae fuck...
take the blame you coward. there wasn't more than enough chances . 28 shots only 9 on target because you won't play either striker on the bench
2 years in a row this manager team selections have cost us not good enough
Every year same nonsense against these basic teams we should be putting in their place simply not good enough
Well that was fecking horrendous. What an embarrassment
Greg Taylor. Shite. He’s clearly a Kilmarnock level player. Not good enough. Offers fuck all.
Taxi for Lennon 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Surely he would of scouted the team to see that they were a quick counter attacking team. Frimpong should of played from the start and at least one striker at the top. Jimmy didnt look like he was in it. Need to pick ourselves up and focus on the remainder of the season🍀🍀
Said Klimala wasn't match fit, not buying that one at all. It's not good enough, but sadly it's also not surprising, same thing every year.
Has to go for me ,great Celtic man and has done well with the club ,but tactically he lacks especially against teams who are well organized , every season he has made mistakes against lesser sides ,
why change the 352 i know tryin tae be pep  or kloss out the door neil what fuckin shit
Absolute Colin nish wasn’t really surprised we Taylor needs to practice that crossing of his
Lennon off u go m8 all u do is waste our money on strikers that can’t even play u don’t play good squads in big games I’m sick of looking at your ginger nut we need someone like Brendan Rodgers
What a great midweek been for a banging world buffet and watch celtic getting pumped out the cup bye bye 👋🏻
Ur fault Lennon  You have no plan b Said it for years even during your first tenure.
Same old same old Copenhagen  cluj  aek Athens  we are  becoming a laughing stock  and the sad thing is when we play a decent team  in the europa league it will happen again
Guys I’m not too happy with him but when he can start using the 3-5-2 when strikers are fit he will do great. Give him a bit more time
naw a fuckin disgrace  your fault neil. nae stricker fae the start dont sub till 78m  shambles.. defence is shite  im enbarresed
If we sack lenny, we wont get 10 iar. Its just his tactics we need the 3-5-2 tactics back then it will be a different story
Much as I hate to say it, we are a europa league team. The moneys the only reason we wanna get into those CL group stages just to get pumped. Europa league group we compete
you need to sort out your team selection if you buy a guy at 5 mil and canny play him  straight away dont fucking buy him. Shocking result, shocking team selection shocking use of subs as well for the last few weeks - very poor
Its a big biscuit tin... Rip the fans off left right and centre. Lenny out his depth sadly
He knows this could be the beginning of the end for his time at Celtic, bad night, stretching from the players to the management
An absolute fraud of a manager.  We wot win the 10 with him.  LENNON OUT.
Piss poor result lenny
They took the pish out of us first half did he no see tht fucking clown
3-5-2
Am fucking greeting my eyes out again
Pathetic time for lenny to get the boot
I hope I wake up tomorrow to find lawell has sacked this clown, he is tactically clueless, has two strikers on the bench but plays a midfielder upfront for 3/4 of the game, honestly your average fan could do better than him. Been done again by a team with a fraction of our budget.
Poor management
Just can't believe what is wrong with us every year in the champions league. Plus a midfielder up front as well I know we needed a goal. Come on the boys 🇮🇪 better results needed ASAP
The fact we started with no striker was bad enough, but to not put one on when we're at 1-1 and dominating the game was criminal. The number of times we managed to get in behind only to end up crossing to an empty box was incredibly frustrating to watch. I love Lenny but he takes the blame for tonight's loss. He made the wrong decision not playing a striker and then failed to act on it when it was clear from the first minute that it was hindering us. Yet another failure in Europe at the hands of an average side at home. Not good enough. 10 in a row but going backwards year on year. Devastated.
Fans wanting him out after this were dropped on their heed as a wain. Biggest season in our history.
Hahahahahahaha, mon who’s first 🤣🎣
£7mliom worth of strikers on the bench and he brings the first one on on 78 minutes??,. And that defence is a joke. We would have got humped in the group stages. Get Duffy in and never play without a striker, fucking shocking
No striker in a European game. Lenny picking all his favs. Screwed us again in Europe. Klimala or Ajeti should have started. Ntcham and McGregor in the starting lining up doesn't work....here we are again.
Sorry Neil too many mistakes now goodbye
Your devastated neil u played a midfielder up front, 2strickers on the bench wat happend neil seriously one wasnt match fit klimala from wat i heard at least put ajeti on up front poor lads sorry hail hail
Get fuckn duffy in now
ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC for a club with an average attendance of 57,000. Knocked out in the qualifiers in the last 3 seasons by the following teams;  2018 AEK Athens (greece). Average home attendance 12,487 2019 Cluj (romania). Average home attendance. 5,149 2020 Ferencvaros (hungary). Average home attendance. 10,715
Ajeti and klimala oan the bench get uer finger oot and use them
lennons fault 100% thinks hes a smart arse cluj copenhagen now this game fucking joke.
This muppet is tactically inept.  Time to get rid with Lawwell who will have Edouard gone now. Watch what happens to this team within the next 2 weeks.
Sorry wtf. Yet again, we foolishly rotate players into irrational positions. We had TWO strikers on the bench. We keep a 35 year old on the pitch and try to fit Ntcham into the system in the wrong position. We made two subs out of five after 75 minutes. We’ve been absolutely shite this season so far. Frimpong would’ve caught the striker for the second goal.
Utter pish lenny
Neil you have taken Ferencvaros for granted and that shows evidently in your team selection. You will have to shoulder this one!   Should the axe wield? Probably not but this has to be one of our worst ever results!
A champions league club playing Europa league football
Sack if u want 10 iar
Same old story 🤬
He’s got some explaining to do for putting a centre mid up front
Poor
Absolute disgrace,Definitely NOT being over dramatic here that was a disgrace! Literally don't know we're to start here!!  The team selection was poor.the squad in general is weak after all the years of strength n depth..WHILE PENNY PINCHING and getting loan players,we still had reasonable strength n depth,Tho with all releases of duds and few great club servants were weak in many positions!  Greg Taylor was great player for Kilmarnock tho hes to feeble and small to play for Celtic!! especially In Europe! Then you've got no cover on wings no wingers bar moi n Forrest bar that it's youth players !! Then you've got Defence,there great big guys tho both are soft as iv ever seen when defending,how Jullien let that bounce by him and get stretched aw er camp not for first time!! is embarrassing!  Tho to play with nchtam/Christie up front was a joke no strength n depth all years of penny pinching and loan players coming back to bite board on ass in 10IAR season!!  Need to have two players competing for each position,I'm tired of all these kids and projects we definitely need to buy a new EXPERIENCED LB,Two new winger for LW and RW No competition,CB role always using bitton as utility man for about 5 years and list goes on!!  I'm tired of writing and ranting tho I'll stop and come back,iv got plenty more to get off my chest,Lawwell and Desmond better stop taking our money and GAMBLING with 10IAR!! 🍀😤💚
Get this prick the sack
i’m going to get a lot of hate for this but we need to get him out that’s too many mistakes now 😐
Shocking defeat
Get him away man that’s embarrassing
Embarrassing
Lennon out
Lenonn out!!
Omg no striker
Ntcham out

Pish
Poor
First

Shocking
