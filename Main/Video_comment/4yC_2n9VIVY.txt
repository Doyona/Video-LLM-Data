Perfeição
these girls are so crazy talented holy fuck
The craziest thing about thsi group is how they switch between EACH OTHERS parts so effortlessly. Jorja and Renée starting discourse because they switch with ease between each others parts. At the end Jorja and Renee do a sick tenor battle. Stella and Renee switching parts! Man these women are really masterpieces with pulses
Perfect 🇧🇷💚🦋
Always have to come back to this iconic performance
The live version is wayyyyy better
Wow it just gets better
💙💙💙💙💙
This version is much better ❤
I listen to this at least twice a day

god they are just so fucking good. this is what i have been needing musically as of late. they are so talented!! their harmonies are flawless DAMN
Wow angels
There's so much chemistry between them vocally it's insane 😭👏🏾👏🏾❤
They are so freaking amazing and talented I’m convinced their voices are what you’d hear in heaven I love them sm💗💗
The outroooo, 🔥🔥🔥 Headphones needed👏🏽
God this is SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE STUDIO ONE
Lauryn Hill at the beginning, Justin Timberlake afterwards, Destiny's Child everywhere and so many more influences in this one song
Wowwwww
renee looks like abt 7'0 ft lmaooo
They are so great. But for sure they're gonna do solos in the near future because they are really great vocalist and beatiful aswell.
Jorja's voice was heavenly in this, Stella's charisma and Renée...I mean...how can you not love Flo !!
69 will think twice next time 🕊🧛‍♀️🔥
Maravilhosas
Eu sou o comentário Brasileiro que vc procura
THE CHORD CHANGES AT THE END 😭😭😭🙌🙌🙌
The one in the green pants kinda sounds like jude demorest from that show star
Yes about Friggin Time!!! Love them!!! You can tell they are proper singers that understand how to harmonise in a clever way! And they are honoring the live musicians.
elles sont trop mignonnes ptn
0:30 Stella’s voice is so unique and velvety smooth those riffs and runs are so effortless! 2:18 2:57 the harmonies, the vocal blend!! Renee’s holds it DOWN with her lower register! These girls are the MOMENT
the random baby noises are so clearly an homage to aaliyah's are you that somebody
Stella did this wayyy too effortlessly 😍 3:14
Someone please put this on spotify!!!!!!!!! i need it frrrr!!!!!!!!!!
why this sound better than the studio version
Yea ima needa new phone bc ain’t no wayyyyyy I just lost my mind bc BABBEEEYYYYY THEY IS SANNNGGGIIINNNNGGG😮😮😮😮
The ending of this song will always be my favorite, their harmonies are ridiculously amazing😍
2:34 i love the sample they used that is a classic my mom listens to it
1:50 what happened her lips lag behind the words
After listening to this 50,000 times I just realized they snuck in the beat from don’t leave me by black street after the bridge 🤯 soooo good!
THEY EAT EVERYTIME.
.can’t believe this was only 5 months ago.
The harmonization is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! These women have such beautiful voices!!
they aren’t real there’s just no way that blend is possible
It’s the 2 pac beat for me at the end
Rooting for these girls 💗 Looking fw to more music from y'all 🥺
✨️❤️
I have a question are they all sopranos?! And yes can someone explain
This version has to go Spotify, it's tooo good
Lord thank you for these girls and their team!! Professional and TALENTED!!
Im getting worried about the whitening in this video!
One thing about UK and Ireland, they come out with amazing, talented girl groups and boy groups I've always liked their groups more.
They also remind me a lot of TLC.  TLC technically wasn’t like the best singing group we had in America but each member brought something to the group.  And tlc really stood out amongst the other female groups.  they had their own sound, own style, own personalities.  And hands-down flo is a fantastic singing group & each member has their own style and personality.
Sounding 🔥🔥🔥ladies!!  Great job!! 👍👍
This is the real life girl group from Star fox series
This is my favorite
yall eat up every damn time omg
Omg this was so good, I got goosebumps
They’re so good it seriously sounds pre recorded. Def one of my new fav groups
How long have we been waiting for a r&b girl group with equal talents ❤
2:49 I’m obsessed with the bout it Stella does
THIS WAS PERFECT VOCALS
This is the bestttt cover they did live than any other.... NICEEEEEEEEE
no every live version of their songs is better than the original except maybe losing u BUT WE HAVENT SEEN IT YET 🤪
1 MILLION VIEWS OH
She ate plus no left crumbs
YUPPPP A MILLION VIEWS IKDRRRR
Muito boas cara
Great vocals, but...  incredibly safe and a bit boring - works well for something the BBC are promoting, but would like to hear something far more adventurous than this.
The profanity is a deal-breaker for my household. We're raising success stories here. Let the neighbors kids learn foul language.
I keep coming back to watch this performance. It's so good 😌
love her tone at the second “walk with you, so walk with me” at 1:33
It's Renee holding down that deep low harmony for me , it sounds so good !
1:31-1:32 no ones mouth was moving. This performance was lipped.
I'm completely addicted to this Girls! 😍
Vevo, please, invite Luísa Sonza to participate on DSCRV, she is a great artist from Brazil, we love her, and sorry, i'm not speak english.
Immaculate!!
Best 2022 performance
FLO in the morning, FLO in the afternoon, FLO in the night
💗💗💗💗💗
💗💗💗💗💗
we need to make them blow up! they are amazing! 🙌🔥👑
3:23 look at Renee !! ❤️❤️❤️ she looking like yeah just carried
RENEE OWNED THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s been four months and I’m still not over this
i love them bro, they just keep popping up on my recommended on twitter & youtube👏🏾
They’re all really good but I can not take my eyes off Jorja 🤩
Love the part after the acapella. The band starts playing the melody of Don’t leave by Blackstreet and if fits so well with the girl’s vocals😍😍
i love how they used the same sample as tupac, de barge, blackstreet boys etc at 2:32
THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!
still need need this and all the other dscvr perfomances on spotify pleaseee😩🙏🏼
Meu deus parecem anjos
there is quite literally no other like them
It's so fucking clear this group is passionate about what they're doing n everyone is 1000% invested n every single note matters n the immaculate very well thought out arrangement just,... 😮‍💨🙄😭
Immature and Cardboard box are there two best songs!!
Their harmonies it’s just too good
Feels like I've been waitin' a lifetime (yeah, yeah) For you to tell me what's goin' on in your mind (mind) But you don't talk to me, talk to me I'm tryna walk with you so walk with me But you be takin' too long (you be takin' too long) Soon, I'll be gone Say you want my body, body  But you ain't never do a thing about it  Baby, lovin' you is such a chore 'Cause you're steady movin' immature I don't want no body, body  Who talk that talk but don't do shit about it Say you gonna put it down for sure Why you gotta be so imma-, imma- Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture Imma-ture Oh (oh) I'm tryna understand your point of view But you fuckin' with me, fuckin' with me Tell me, how can I relate (ah) If you don't communicate? But you don't talk to me, talk to me (oh) I'm tryna walk with you so walk with me (walk with me, yeah) But you be takin' too long (you be takin' too long) Soon, I'll be gone Say you want my body, body (ah) But you ain't never do a thing about it (ha-ah-ah-ah) Baby, lovin' you is such a chore 'Cause you're steady movin' immature I don't want no body, body (no I don't, no I don't) Who talk that shit but don't do shit about it Say you gonna put it down for sure Why you gotta be so imma-, imma- Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture Imma-ture Say you want my body, body But you ain't never do a thing about it (thing about it) Baby, lovin' you is such a chore 'Cause you're steady movin', immature I don't want nobody, body (no, oh) Who talk the talk but don't do shit about it (about it) Say you gonna put it down for sure (down for sure) Why you gotta be so imma-, imma- Immature, immature (immature, immature) Immature, immature (immature, immature) Ha, ah, ah (imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture) Immature, so immature Why you gotta be? (So immature) Why you gotta be? (So immature) So immature Oh
I totally love this rendition. The sample from Blackstreet "Don't leave" is my favorite part!
i am in awe 😭
okay but like we just NOT gonna talk about the intro 🥶 that shit was cold- the amount of chills-
THEY ARE SO TALENTED, WHAT
This my fav
These girls are out of this word fr and the instrumentals?? The keyboard?? Wow next level fr
I’m feeling them
They all sound so emasculate and beautiful I love it!!!!!
“Why you gotta be so immaaaaa”😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Up next as a girl group  lover I needed them
OMG I AINT MAD AT CHA BROOOOOOOOOOOO, A-MA-ZING
Elas são surreais! As vozes conseguem se misturar muito bem, mesmo em tons totalmente diferentes. Renée com um ótimo grave consegue cantar em uníssono com a Jorja tem que possui uma voz clara e com Stella que possui uma voz escura, mantendo a base nas melodias. Stella consegue suprir o lugar de soprano muito bem com seus falsetes e possui um timbre muito marcante. Jorja nem se fala, THEE RANGE, a mona com uma potência nos agudos/médios e um bom grave.  Estamos presenciando o nascimento de um grupo que vai marcar o R&b/Pop nos próximos anos.
Their voices give recorded track every time❤️🔥
THEY ATE SO BAD IM GONNA CRY, THEYRE SO GOOD 😭
My GOD they are so good
i’m so ready for a girl group again.. Age of Aquarius/ Year of the woman .. finally somebody see it
this intro is SO GOOD. i can't!!!!! 😭
Eu acho um absurdo essas Rainhas não serem reconhecidas, vamos dar muito views pras gatinhas
Yaaas 😍❤🇧🇷
I hear y'all with that Blackstreet sample at 2:33!!!

Renee is the weakest vocally
Renee’s low note at 2:32 was so good omfg
Is that NORMANI OR AM I TRIPPEN TRIPPEN ? 😳🤦🏽‍♂️ if not she look JUST LIKE HER
I feel like it's my moral obligation to promoto these girls till they are mainstream! Their music and talent is everything I needed!
THE FUCKING DEBARGE/BLACKSTREET/2PAC/FIFTH HARMONY SAMPLE AT THE END? HOLY SHIT.
Renee is taking it as usual ❤
I got chills throughout the entire performance 😳 Crazy talented
Stella ate! And Renee’s vocal choices always just wow! & sis was feeling herself through this whole thing & while Jorja was slaying her parts their faces they just know they did that $hit 🔥

They all have beautiful voices. They don't try to outsing eachother, their harmonies are intricate but powerful. Love this version 💯💯
So effing good !
okay but stella's vocals at 2:49 love they're reaction when she did that!
Does anyone know where i can get the instrumental to this , i wanna perform this at a talent show pls .
Las mejores!!! Van subiendo
My hears have been blessed
i need all of their live performances streamable its so rare to come across an artist let alone a whole group of talented people who some how sound better not only performing live but giving different renditions live?!? every! single! time! i to say i feel grateful for stan twitter putting me on when cardboard box just came out is a gross understatement. it's such a privilege to watch renee stella and jorja grow and rise up from the jump as people and artists. they always seem to be having fun with each performance they've done and their spirits and nature makes an already enjoyable experience infinitely more enjoyable. i'll be rewatching for years to come and am so excited for their futures together!!
Yessssssss ♥
WOW they r so good
I don't see a huge f*ckin' good R&B since Destiny's Child!
Those ladies knock out many artists singing live
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😩
Stella’s run 1:28 chills
Stella’s voice is out of this world her tone hits different almost like Sza 1:18 (NOT comparing, i meant by the way both of their voices sound so unique in the their own way, you just gotta love and appreciate them both ❤️.
I feel like the short girl doesn’t have long solos in any of their songs
I kno darn well yall heard the little I aint mad at cha melody addition❗️ whoever put this set together needs a raiseeee
Please release the live version on spotify 🙏
I love how the way the songs vibe reminds me of old groups and the bratz the way they hold the mics(the bratz is an early 2000s show or movie)
meu deus a surraaaaaaa na versão de estúdio!!! artistas demais, eu não aguento
They are so talented. I can see them making music history 👏🏼
I love them!! #DOPE 😊
Okkk bout time somebody did some real homework on 90s r&b cause I can tell they been studying
I love this version over the original💖🙌 Edit: spelling
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
We KNOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
i actually can’t stop watching this. their vocals are so good and i’m obsessed with their harmonies!
This group is the next BIG thing
Wow
I could see one of them with The Weeknd ❤ if not then definitely they’ll collab 🥲
I love how they're bringing back the 90s /2000s rnb back into the mainstream! And they work so well as a group. Plus the vocals are immaculate 🔥🔥🔥
jaw on the floor
ohhh their voices are amazing and harmony makes me fall in love
Somenody please put this version on spotify 😭
Wowowowowowowowowo
They actually deserve to include the Tupac sample at the end
so true
I can get over how absolutely beautiful Renee is. 🥰🥰

Came here again cuz this isnt on Spotify. Its TOOO good 🤧
Wow! What vocals😍
Woah!
2:16
It’s been a month. When are you releasing this version on streaming services? 🤨
I’m blown away. This is better than the original!
I held off on watching this to build anticipating for myself because I knew that I would be blown away, but THIS NEARLY BROUGHT ME TO TEARS. I am just speechless. FLO, you have gained a fan for life, and I wish you every single success in your very bright future! <3
Hopefully they can be mature enough to keep the group together 💯 because they🔥🔥
2:32 Ok my inner childhood jumped when I hear that Blackstreet sample
People who knows music . This not easy to blend. Without going off key. They must be singing together fo a while now.   Bravo girl. I dont know them but i got interested and i 'll go google.   My ears are just loving this. The lyrics are good. The voices are beautiful and the work behind. Just bravo ❤️❤️❤️🥰
Ok. Yes to girl groups that can sang sang.
Omg the chemistry gives me goosebumps every single time
THEY DID THIS SHITTTTTT!!!!!! i am actually in tears by the perfection!!!! i stan TALENT!!!!!!
i never got cheetah girls vibes from any current girl groups till yall stepped in the scene! its just fab
Love this band
I love their music, their harmonies, their voices are stunning. Only thing is the dancing, the energy seems off but then again- they just debuted. I hope the charisma shines soon because they have so much potential.  (p.s. im so over every rnb group having a light skinned, dark skinned, and 'in the middle' skin tone i thought we left that shit in the early 2000s)
Haven’t seen a trip with this much chemistry since TLC. This is so refreshing. Each girl is equally as talented and beautiful.
o talento delas véi vtmnc pqp
wen they harmonize… like they’re stupid good !! been rewatching since it came out like this is beyond amazing
omg who did they sample? I can hear a 90s song in the back

Impecáveis

One of the best live performances I’ve ever seen in my life wow😭😭goosebumps all around
Elas são fodas. E essa banda gente, qualidade de última geração.

A harmonia perfeitaaaa 🤌🤌🤌
oooffttt, Making me pull stank facess n that, Im obsessed, bringggg R&B back pleaseee i miss it 😭😭😭
The fact that they even sound better in live JESUS
W.O.W 😱♥️💗
I can’t wait for the girls to come to Dublin so I can hear them live in person.  Their voices are like liquid gold to my ears. Just magical
Kinda annoying for youtube to keep throwing kpop girl groups in my mends when I prefer to listen to western ones.  Been waiting for another soulful gg and FLO's harmonies bagged me.  Ok that harmony part on the intro is a take on a song and I can't remember, help.
SO GOOD SO SO GOOD
Boas demais pra esse mundo pqp!!!!!
these girls just keep on slaying
my day doesn’t start until i watch this video.
That "Lauryn Hill killing me softly run" at the beginning was so smooth 😍👌🏾🤞🏾
Omg what's the girls name with the skirt, I really like her voice
cannnnooot!! I am literally OBSESSED
theyre just too good
Whoa! This has a Late 90's vibe and Early 2000s! 🎶❤❤  I love this style! Perfect.
Ok the harmonies popping.
Wow!!!  Such an AWESOME SONG, me and my daughter ,who is a big fan of you guys really appreciated this new song and finally appreciate your return to making a statement  to this lackadaisical R%B era of good music. We are looking forward to hearing more footage of your upcoming releases. I"m not a professional A&R ,but I would like to share my thoughts and perceptions to gravitate to a more universal fanbase ,when it comes to limiting any expletives to articulate any singing skills. The name of your group is entitled "Flo"!!! Hit me with some more "Flo" and bring the R@B game back with some 21st century swagg that you don't need to follow the  rest of these fools when it comes to enjoying some good music w/o the "F" bomb. Im not coming down on the beautiful lady who utilized this word part of her lyrics, but lets come up with more inviting adjectives to to hit the world airwaves universally, and prove that you guys dont need the "F" word to compensate for any lyrics!
too good … TOO GOOD!!!!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Eu preciso desse acústico no Spotify está maravilhoso🙌😍
This whole song just gives me chills love it
Did anyone else clock the pianist doing the melody for don't leave me by black street at the end ?!!! I loveeee live versions
They should stop eating their own CDs 😭
We desperately need summertime and feature me live
jesus christ they are so goooooooooood
Come on Debarge interpolation!
Giving very much BLAQUE
fave r&b group <333
This is God Tier talent, wtf??? A true R&B girl group that takes you back to the golden age of the 90s-2000s, but with modern production. As a 3LW stan and a casual fan of 702, TLC, Danity Kane, etc. This is what i like to see! I'm keeping an eye on them
Gente elas são demais ✨ Era meu segredinho, acho que já não é mais 🍀
love it
so good!
I’m definitely a huge fan of these girls❤️
I want them to cover Aaliyah’s are you that somebody soooooo bad after hearing this!
Jorja's so gorgeous!
Bro imagine them and ChloexHalle collaborating
okay rennes lower register is actually impressive wtf
F L O IN YOUR FA CE BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII❤❤🔥🔥
The harmonies are my favorite part. Y’all are so damn clean
Renee’s and Jorja’s voices are so similar when they do notes or harmonies together it sounds so full like stacking vocals it’s sick
They’re literally perfect😭🫶🏽
Perfect ✨✨✨✨✨🔥
im so happy i found this amazing group when they first debuted with Cardboard Box, they're what i needed, cant wait to see them grow even more, this was perfection <333

Talented girlss!! i love it.
So it's taken me a minute to get every girls range. What is surprising to me is Renne though she has a light voice can sing that low " why gotta be". Who the heck put this group together? We are witnessing greatness love these beautiful, and talented young ladies ❤️💞
The song is absolutely awesome 😍🥰.
WOW

Sounds like they interpolated the DeBarge’s “A Dream” at the end 😍 love it! Here I was thinking the song was just produced beautifully but they sound even better here!!!!
Renee looks just like normani at the end there holy shit
I can't write in English 'cause I'll not say it properly: Elas são fodas!  Harmonia perfeita, vozes, looks... E a banda aí! *Chef kiss* Ignorei esse vídeo por dias, agora estou arrepiada com o que ouvi e vi. Vou ouvir mais delas! Nota 10 mesmo!
QUEENS
I’m amazed… they’re so gorgeous and talented. Those harmonies has my jaw dropping.
amazing.
Sheesh, the harmony game is immaculate! <3
crying again....is this heaven??? I just can't, i can't even say anything...
3:05 are u kidding....... so heavenly oh my god
EVERYTHING
THANK YOU YOUTUBE!!!
Wowwwww
I definitely needed to hear a live of this. The record doesn't really display their obvious vocal talents. And I still feel like they were holding back.   But this live was great. I wish vocals were valued more these days. But the top 40 just wanted basic clean vocals.    These 3 slayed it.
Ok a new girl group who can sang 🔥🔥🔥
Le R&B vous attendait!  🙏🏾❤️ J’adore !
Absolutely love how Renee holds down those low notes! Whew!
my ears have been blessed
FLO is going to be the opening act on the “Renaissance“ tour🤫
🔥❤️
Wow I found these girls about a week ago… I can’t stop watching their videos and listening to their music. They all give me super different vibes but then the vibe when they come together is crazy good. Renee gives me Normani vibes. Stella gives me Rihanna vibes for real for real and Jorja reminds me of Dinah Jane from Fifth Harmony. I can see these girls going on to do big things just like my girls Little Mix but of course for stupid music industry reasons LM didn’t get a lot of time in the USA. But I can see these girls being the next Destiny’s Child and being big in the US bc they’re more R&B and we love that shit over here. It’s giving TLC/Destinys Child and I am ready for more of that in the music industry. It’s been a while.. anyway I’m rambling but I fuck with girl groups and R&B so I’m just excited. Exiting the chat now peace and love y’all
Ayooooo. I need THIS version available for download on Apple Music! ASAP
Okay, so hear me out...I really like their chemistry with each other and I'm loving their EP, BUT I cannot fully stan an artist or group until I hear them live. This isn't officially live. They may have sung it in one take, but the vocals are wwaaayyy too touched up to be considered live. Love them, but I need some REAL live performances.
Beautiful ❤️💕❤️💕
Renée at 3:10 - 3:15 OMGGGG 🥲
They sound DAMN GOOD!!!!!
It’s giving star! And I love it cause that was my show!
The live musicians OMG wowwwww
i stan
I watch this on the daily now it's sooo goodd
this is amazing..
Jorja 🥹 idk man she does something for me i love this group so much
everything from their harmony to their movements are just so in sync i literally love it, thank you flo!!! 😍😍😍
💜💜💜💜
I LOVE IT!
Renee looks like and sounds like normani
lol, That Debarge sample damn near killed me, I just love them so much.
Queens!!!

The 2Pac Instrumental at the end 😭
damn girls! masterpiece
The arrangement on the last hook.... TASTE
They sound so goooddd😭😭🙌🏾
jaw dropped. slay. in. every. freakin. angle. the voices the visuals the melody the harmonies the base the- EVERYTHING. this is everything.
There are 2 types of people  in this world: People that Stan FLO and People that don’t have good taste in music
Renee’s lower register is insane! And that DeBarge sample at the end???!! I almost fell over 😭💕
Eu tô viciado nessa versão

0:00               1:04               2:04               2:32
Wooooow 🛐
Near the end, them harmonies have me on a chokehold. Over here holding my breath 😂😭 girl breathe!!

they ate, left no crumbs sis periodt #johnnyversayce #slayrights
The harmony please 😮‍💨
Though I believe both these new videos used pre-recorded versus "live" vocals, I am so impressed with the vocal arrangements for these ladies. Hats off to MNEK and the team!!  I want to truly hear them shine LIVE with full out vocals soon though. I just know they are practicing and perfecting this.
Ole girl look like Normani. They give an early 2000s feel I love it.
Flo outsold your faves 💁🏽‍♀️
Ummmm they’re gonna be BIG
bro the chemistry with their vocals and harmonies is so beautiful
They are so beautiful and talented I can’t deal
They're absolutely perfect, their harmony is unique 💘🔥
I had missed a girl group where they all can actually sing and carry their weight in the group. Come through FLO!!!!!!!
I love the “Don’t Leave” reference!!
I. AM. FLOORED!
🗣OKAY HARMONIES‼
FLOp
The girl in black looks like if meg the stallion and normani had a baby😍 but I love all their voices!
BRAVA!!!🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿😭😭😭👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Donassssss

They're so good!!!

Y’all did that! Period
Vocais perfeitos ✨

They are so gorgeous and so talented.  My jaw was on the floor during this whole performance.  AND THE HARMONIES!!!!!!!!!
Love them. Renee stage presence is awesome. The camera d Always finds her in this performance
Wowwwwwww!
Is it just me that sees the resemblance between the beautiful brown skin young lady and Normani?
No games were played the entire time but from 2:18 onward it was really o/v. The way they switched up them harmonies.🔥
Their vocals live 🥰💅🏾🗣👏🏽
😍😍😍😍

I hope they go big, but stay with this genre
This is WIIILLDDDD🤯🤯🤯🤯
I feel like they’re so happy to do what they’re doing. There’s such a good energy, they look so passionate and the fact that they twist the instrumental and change some notes shows how much they’re talented. Look out for them

I LOVE Stella's lil consistent thong look! She is toooo adorbs!
There is a specific science to girl groups, y'all get it just right. Genuine friendship so no one is too "afraid" to be the star.
NO CRUMBS. ABSOLUTELY DEVOURED
FLO is a huge inspiration to me and I WILL produce a song for them one day.
Omggg their voices are flawless 😭❤️

Mouth agape the entire time! So much talent. And can we acknowledge the band playing DeBarge/Blackstreet towards the end? GENIUS!
Future stars on the way...
Renee's "yeah yeah" adlibs at 0:19 🎶🥰
You did AMAZING ladies! Waiting for the Summertime MV to drop!
the way Jorja did that @ 2:10 😩😍
They sing SING
😭✨
Their voice is so beautiful and incredible ! 🔥👑🌹🥰❤️
wow 🤩🫶🏽
Don’t play or mess with FLO because they coming to take over the world 🌍 point.blank.Period!
Love this they sound so good together ❤❤❤❤
Something within me tells me they could've gone harder. I think the mix was a bit off, the arrangements was cold but there was something missing. I'm only saying this cause I FULLY believe in these girls and they're on route to the moon and stars but irregardless , keep grinding and shining
at 2:49 you can sorta tell that stella didn’t do that run in rehearsal; renee and jorja both look at her like they were surprised then they all smiled
Amazing!
Quit playing with FLO!!! 🙌🏾🔥
I clicked on this video so fast and the moment I heard the harmony I literally got tingles I'm so happy that they exist
omggg today i was literally like “is there a live version of immature” and now it’s here 😭😭😭😭
I had an eargasm
They have soo much potential! They can all sing, great harmonies, they are look stunning, but they just need better music, imo. Something a lot MORE catchy and upbeat.
Y’all ate!!!
the voice of angels 🙌🏽
they got HARMONIES for days!!! vocally, they'll be on the same tier as Little Mix in a few years
1:27😭
@flo get my neckkkkkkk

We are starving for talent
This is gold.
Wow … just wow…. This is literally one of the best vocal groups in a really long time.
I am SICK with these vocals!!!!!! Like WHAT.
#FloEver a fan ❤️❤️🔥🔥
monaaaAAAAA 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Elas são perfeitas, eu não consigo!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
good god im so gobsmacked
I didn’t know this could get better than the original 😭😭😭
There harmonies are reminding me of little mix and dc
Show me a girl group in our generation that is better than FLO, I'll wait...
Now that Little Mix is essentially over, I'm glad there's another vocally talented group on the scene. There hasn't been a FULLY R&B female group in YEARS.
Am I the only one that is CAPTIVATED by Stella??? Like every one of them is drop-dead gorgeous, but Stella’s voice, look, and expressions… I want to be the floor that woman walks on 🫠
the melody interpolation at the end means so much
I love how they said, “lets spend the first 18 seconds of this performance showing you the most talented live harmonies in the last 20+ years, then we can start the song” ❤️‍🔥
immaculate
🤩💞
Vocal delivery for your money!!!! I mean come on these girls have what it takes to become superstars.  Run up the views guys
I love their voices together. The harmonies are just so beautiful 💞.
They are so good!!❤️❤️❤️
TLC, Destiny's Child의 부활인가 ㅋㅋ 완전 추억 돋네

They are not only EXTREMELY talented but if I'm being honest 🙏🏾this is the first girl group I've heard in a while where it never feels like they need to compete with one another because they are all TOP TIER VOCALISTS 🙌🏾💕
🔥🔥🔥
very few singers sound good live flo is one one of those singers
Am I the only one to find that renee imposes herself more vocally than in their old performance I'm happy for her that she continues. I'm sure she can do better !
Omg i just love you guys !!!!!! You make me believe in music again
Incredible!

Oh my lordddtttttttt, THE FUTURE 🤩
♡
If I'm being honest, I get BIG En Vogue energy from these women.... And I live for that, cause En Vogue in there prime was one of the most perfect girl groups. Besides DC3, I don't think any of the others were as polished. But it's all love!
Yess!! They slayed this as expected! I cannot wait for a feature me performance, I may pass out.
This was very disrespectfulllll 🤬 do y’all hear this arrangement!! The ladies are SINGINGG
JUST PERFECTION 🥲
THESE WOMEN ARE THE FUTURE!!
❤️‍🔥
THEYRE EVERYTHING PERIOD
HARMONIRS ARE BACKKKK
So when are these versions going to be on streaming?
MY HEART MAN I LOVE THEM
they're sooo good!!!!
WHOEVER their MD is... sir/ma'am this arrangement was ARRANGED BY THE GODS. this was absolutely phenomenal
INCROYABLE PURÉE 🫠🥵😮‍💨
Sick!
Not the Blackstreet sample😭love this group sm. Been waiting for an Immature performance. The harmonies on this song, especially on the outro, ugh🤧🤎
IT’S FLO SEASON
vocals bringing me to my KNEES!!!!!!! the interpretation from in-studio original to live performance was impeccable. individually and harmonically perfect.  this work of art is laid edges and lashes; THINGS I NEED TO EXIST IN THIS LIFE!!!!  AND DON'T THINK I MISSED THE TUPAC 'I AIN'T MAD AT YOU' (He sampled Debarge's 'A Dream', which is a fcking CLASSIC) SAMPLE-BREAKDOWN @ 2:32!!!!!!!
In love chile
THEY'RE THE MOMENT!
Jorja is a fucking beastttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yall this gagged me!
PUTA QUE PARIUUUUUU LINDAS INCRÍVEIS
THEIR VOICES>>>>>>

WHATTHHEE that music arrangement at the end, featuring DeBarge’s sample?! Are you freakn kidding me?! Those musicians, THESE GIRLS, this entire team is SICKENING! I cannnnooot!! I am literally OBSESSED 😭♥️
yesssss, thank you for that, YESSSSSSSSSSSS
The harmonies in the beginning.....the band using the Debarge sample in the end😍😍 these girls are everything💯 Bravo
Stella with the beautiful high notes, Jorja's soulful range, Renée's unique tone. Together so beautiful. You know it's gonna blow you away with such a killer intro! Their harmonies blend naturally and vocals very stable, no one doing too much or trying to out do the other. They're in sync and we love to see it. FLO, the next biggest girlgroup.
So good 😭
I really think flo is gonna open the door for labels to sign or start their own groups because these songs and talent
Reinee is so cute 💖 I love her voice
loved the fugees' killing me softly reference at the start of the performance. they paid homage and did it flawlessly
