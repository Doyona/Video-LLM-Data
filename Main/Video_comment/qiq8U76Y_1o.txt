Now days England is full of Muslims  🫣
Best comedy of all time imo. And bernard manning best stand up comedian of all time. Unlike s--t like tarbuck or Davidson
Trigger "alright Dave" never fails.
Del.  Sounds.  Like.   Arther.   Daly
😂😂😂😂😂
Rather than nothing to lose, Mike had nothing to gain if he won and £5 to lose.
It was nearly pulled after the first series was a failure in viewing terms!!!!
"Customers have to pay for their drinks" Never was a fan of that rule tbh 😢 😅😂
Without trigger this sitcom was not that great
Trigger was brilliant  🎉😂
there you go dave 😂😂
Does anyone know what series episode this was thanks
Brilliant  when the uk people laughed. ? Not not know 🤔
EU Ursula must have watched this all night before meeting Trumputin 🤣
Triggers trick is a metaphor of Starmer dealing with the EU
Only fools out rates comedies like fawlty towers and that is saying something
An industrial paint stripper will certainly dry your hair? 😂😂😂
Love when youtube randomly recommends me clips like this!
Genius!!
Comedy genius (Trigger)
what a year is ?
I always say the same thing. John Sullivan wrote the script for the character Trigger But it was Rodger Lloyd Pack that done the acting perfectly. A complete professional. Also never forget Rodger playing a club owner in The Bill. Great acting front one of British true professional actors.
Comic genius! ❤
British culture British humour  I miss these days
Quality
🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁
Brilliant ❤
National treasure
God bless for Trigger.
Just brilliant 😂  Modern so called  'comedy' today is just so abysmal!  Thank goodness for these gems from the past. They will always be solid Gold.
Roger Lloyd pack in real life a wonderful man too. Met him a few times just so kind.
British humor - you can't beat it!
Roger Lloyd Pack's acting when he first comes over to watch Delboy is just phenomenal. You can see every bit of him taking it all in... well almost all! :)
He was absolutely brilliant  and always a straight face
...can they not start a modern series of this programe. If you guys help me with ideas and mabe I could put a play together. It would be awesome if we did.
Howling lol
Never ever again will anything like this be created pure genius
Beware Drinking & Thinking with  Del Boy .🍓
haha Trigger was the best, RIP
That is a great trick. I am definitely gonna start using that.
Absolutely lost it, my shoulders have gone 🤣
2:51 This demonstrates Boycie's power to make me laugh by the power of his voice alone.
I didn't get this first time round. And then Trigger puts a fiver in 'Dave's' hand ! Absolutely brilliant !!!!
What a great show and Trigger was the secret ingredient.
Trigger was the best character in that show. Always had the best gags. Mind you, what got me during the whole sketch was Uncle Albert playing the piano so terribly and noone even notices.
They must have had a great time filming
Back in the days be video recording, we had to stay in to watch this, wouldn’t miss it for the world.
I just did that to everyone 8n my family works like a charm 😂
Yeh, we did this scam back in school in the 50's.
I was working at a school in Indonesia, and an American guy called Rodney started. I called him Dave all of his first day, and everyone else started calling him Dave, too. It stuck, and he worked there for two years never understanding why everyone called him Dave.
Im with Mike that's why I shave my head on daily basis
Hold yer hands out Dave
I still dont how how roger lloyd pack managed to say his lines as trigger when everyone else was crying with laughter. 😂
I thought Barty Crouch Sr would use his magic wand on Rodney sorry DAVE 🪄😂
Still makes me giggle like an idiot!
Only fools and horses my best comedy 😅
lol 👏
Boycie would probably be a billionaire by now
I think the BBC is banned on Facebook. They won't let me share any BBC media to the fb app. 🙄
2024 and this is still hilarious
Its been said loads of times,  but  only fools and horses was and is the best ever British sitcom ever made, John Sullivan was an absolute genius writer,  the actor's they pick to play the characters were brilliant, could not have gone any better, I absolutely love only fools and horses, I've watched the sitcom hundreds of times  to my wife's annoyance, every single time I watch them it makes me laugh,  I'm so sad they don't make any more only fools and horses,  but things must come to an end,  TV in the days when they knew how to do it.
God I miss watching this show every week back in the 80s. It was the only show everyone in the family loved. Triggered was always my favourite. Perfectly cast and acted.
What episode is this one
Del obviously tha trick back in school,thats where I did. Trigger, what a dumbnut.
Ahhhh back when I at least considered paying the licence fee.
The best ever
There'll never be anything like OFAH ever again.
Here's a fact, daft but true, everytime a publican serves drinks technically they break the law!  The law prohibits publicans to give credit, so between your ordering the drinks and he serving them then taking your money you got  credit!
For now on customers have to pay for there drinks 😂😂😂😂
The dead pan alright Dave cracks me up every time.will never get old 😄😄😄😄😄
Genius this is
There’s something so deeply satisfying about the way that Trigger takes his hand out of his pocket and slaps the note into Rodney’s upturned palm at 3:53
Boycie was ahead of his time with that electric car comment
1:08 I can relate, I have fine hair. :)
Why can't I give this another thumbs-up every time I watch it?  It deserves it!
In 2023 that same round of drinks would be about a grand
EVs what a joke in reality just Milk Floats
Best series ever 👏 I've watched it million times all start to finish and still at 52 find new angles n laughs , really is the pinnacle of writing acting
When Trigger sees an actual gun trigger, it triggers a lot of psychological triggers within Trigger 😳
Pure brilliance!!
ok
ok
wow electric cars
Nicholas Lyndhurst is Marvellous actor love him so much he should get a knighthood for service to acting
The east end predicted the future in the seventies.
so good
I thought the pubs were cheap in the olden days
If boyce really had done that or whoever wrote that part of the script would be Multi billionaires
Trigger is a great friend
British humour is the best 👌
LOL with tears, beautiful. OFAH is what life's about, avin a laugh at life at every opportunity ;) Such a sham Del became a pig... ;(
Willow
Bless Trig, was like an English Forrest Gump
Love this program still to this day doesn’t matter how many times u have seen the same scene still makes u laugh as hard as the first time
Alright Dave?😁😁
Sheer class. They'll never be a sitcom quite like it.
Shame they don't make them like that anymore..
ELECTRIC CARS… we should have invested in what’s his name, that Musk fella!!! 😐
Gold !
Complete bull-s—t
Superb, Back in the days you were allowed to have fun!
In God we trust . Others pay cash !
I like to think Trigger intentional did that so Rodney could afford a round.
I like to think Trigger intentional did that so Rodney could afford a round.
Boycie was ahead of the curve talking about electric cars. RIP.
This is my 2nd favourite sitcom moment of all time (the 1st is the Father Ted small/far away cows)
Them hairdryers would stroip paint off a door
Boycie ahead of his time
Absolutely brilliant timeless
Funny everytime you watch it.
Doesn't work on non-British people
I wonder is there men out there as bad as Trigger, just asking
The irony he was talking about electric cars in the 80s.   No mention of CC though.
The best was the  "same broom" one with replacement brushes and handles.
See! There you go, Dave! 😂
John Sullivan created the "Dave" as a running gag.
£25 for them drinks. I think that's least £65 for that in today's pubs
😂😂😂
"Okay I'll buy for a fiver"  The quick wit on Del Boy hahaha
LMAO!
RIP John Challis and Roger Lloyd Pack.
Investing in electric cars, who'd have thought.
That would come in handy😅😅😅
Did Del not believe in drinking the drinks before getting another round in? 😂😂
Absolutely classic
ITS ALL BEEN SAID BELOW....PRICELESS.
Jesus! DO try to improve the printed grammar!   Not to MENTION the 'spelling'!
trigger is the best
There'll never be another Trigger.  A wonderful actor in everything he did.  Sadly missed,
trigger such a natural!
Yeah Dave got a bit wearing after a while.u plonker
Bossier talking about investing in Electric cars!
LOL the power of positive thought
Love this - all great characters
Boycie predicted the future of motoring.
Lol that hand trick eh
I wish the writers were writing for WWE
Brilliant as always. Rest in Peace Roger Lloyd Pack and Kenneth MacDonald. Great actors and will always be missed.
Brilliant just utterly brilliant. The best show ever created by none. After all these years & endless times of watching every episode every one still leaves me in absolute stitches.
Triggers a header absolutely brilliant "Rodger Lloyd packs" guide to how to play someone that's absolutely thick as 2 short planks to perfection 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legendary best ever
2:50 Elons inspiration!
true fact best comedy ever made
Epic Greatness right there!
Nicholas is always overlooked though, he is pure class.
Boycie was right.
notice how trigger is nearly always very smartly attired..... not bad for a refuse worker with a peanut brain !
you can watch Only Fools and Horses any time of the day and you would still love it - it is a timeless piece of national treasure - the best on TV
Bankok nightlife
Absolutely brilliant 🤩
Investing in Electric Cars....'canned laughter'....but Boycie was a modern day Prophet...as Tesla shares are on the up & high atm  lol
RIP Boycie Trigger & Mike.
£25 for circa 8/9 drinks!?!?!?!?!
Absolute quality from start to finish....script, actors....everything.....use to look forwards to this bin on  telly.
I absolutely love the character trigger and nobody else could have played that part like Roger RIP you still make us laugh  and will do for many generations to come.
The writing in this series never faulted
Belter 🤣🤣🤣
I always had soft love for Rodney
When we went back to school after the new year all the kids in the playground were copying this
Boycie was always the smart cookie. Bigging up electric cars. Sad he's not around to see how well his Tesla shares would have done!  Tragic that we're losing all these legends one by one.
“Alright Dave”
Triggers magic trick.  Waiting, waiting, waiting, there we go! 😁😁😁
The chandelier episode is my favourite piece of tv humour ever :)
Boycie knew about electric cars back in they days 😎
Top man.
Absolute quality  “ alright Dave”
I was in Iceland the other day, (as you do) lol actually it weren't the other day it was Halloween time, & this young girl serving had this pink cowboy hat on, & i asked her why she had it on? & she said, "Oh we was all gonna dress in fancy dress but when i turned up i was the only one that dressed up" So i said, "Oh thats like that episode of only fools & horses where they dressed up as Batman & Robin but when they turned up everyone else was dressed normal" & she said, "I've never seen that,  im only young, i'm not that old" 😂 When i got home i thought about it n thought "You cheeky cxnt" 😂 So shes calling all us lot old! Who'd have thought it! just coz we was lucky enough to live thru this classic tv program were deemed as old lol
When ever I'm down or stressed I search these things out, now I've got a smile on me face 🤘🤘😂
It's a good Trigger scene, granted, but nothing will ever beat his "everlasting sweeping brush".
That electric car investment would be paying dividends now.
These guys always crack me up
Boyce created tesla before Elon musk
Just brilliant as ever!
Poor old Ken MacDonald bless him... He played the pub landlord so well... Died far to young. RIP
Boyce was ahead of his time with the electric car comment.
Electric cars !!!!! how funny
Trigger and Dave were a classic comedy act.
Hilarious.
John Sullivan was an absolute genius
When comedy was funny,clever and just brilliant. Never missed an episode,better days,sadly passed. Thanks for posting 😆👍
Trigger has to be one of the all-time best sitcom characters ever created.
Rodney always reminds me of Mr Humphrey's,. I'm free    from are you being served
Comedy genius !
Canned laugher? Oof
I think only fools and horses cant be beat for comedy value but I also think trigger was probably the best on the show with his one liners.
Legends.
I know this is on gold most days but there's nothing better watching only fools over Christmas on the telly ❤️👌
Ban this it’s too funny.
Good old BBC - electric car plug
Pure have humour, Golf that will never get old...🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is classic comedy scenes 👍
True story... Trigger was never supposed to be in the scene where Del falls through the bar,  Infact trigger ( Roger ) was off for a while with an injury to his arm if i remember correctly and was only passing by and popped onto the set for a visit and John sullivan after seeing trigger walk down the stairs in the bar where Del was came up with the idea of Del falling through the bar..... LEGENDS
lmao
We don't deserve Only Fools and Horses!
I need to remember that trick, I keep forgetting 😂
That's classic.
There won’t be any in 20 years as BBC makes rubbish now.
brilliant !
Classic.
Trigger had the best one liners in the show lol
Rodney was missing £5 to make the £25 for the drinks, which he inadvertently "won" by "losing" to Trigger...😂...The editing should've been a little after where it ended to show this.
Brilliant 👏
Absolutely brilliant
Boycie was a visionary but just too far ahead of his time, investing in EVs would've made him super rich, just not back then lol.
The writing. The pacing. The delivery. All brilliant! What a great show Only Fools and Horses was.
Absolutely class🤣🤣🤣
The late, great man Roger Lloyd Pack aka trigger, pure class 👍🏼😂
Boyce knew
Trigger and "Dave"! Quality!!
I love how he slaps down the fiver. Priceless absolute comedy gold.
this is quality innocent by gone times.
Timeless❤
My dad used to try that joke on me...
David Jason said that working with the others in the cast he was aware that they were acting a part. With Lloyd-Pack he said he became Trigger and never displayed a single hint that he was acting. High praise for any actor particularly from one of high calibre.
Classic 👍
It's It's shame the BBC of today is incapable of producing golden shows like this.
Ahead of his time was boycie 😃
Brilliant
Back in the day!....When the world was happy & a nice place to be.
Trigger has yo be the best comedy character ever. Thank you Roger.
Class comedy
What episode was this one. I thought I'd seen them all.. But can't remember watching this scene
"They've brought in this revolutionary new rule, from now on customers have to pay for their drinks" 🤣
When the BBC weren't woke
The only  comedy  now is BORIS Johnson
Imagine the Yanks trying to do their version of this..It would be utter shite!
I don’t
only fools....ive so got to watch them all again, best comedy scripts and acting, nothing these days can compete
Simply 😂😂😂 ! 🙏
trigger is something else :):):):):):)
We'll have to watch this in a few years time to explain to younger people what a pub was .
Lol 😆 quality show 👌 not sure this will be equalled but I'd like to see
Put it on the slate mike.
What a great scene, Boycie emulating Arthur C Clarke predicting the future (the ascendance of electric cars), Trigger with more cash than Del and poor Mike, told by the brewery to start charging for drinks; priceless!
The whole clip is absolute brilliance. But one thing I don't get is that del get Rodney to get a round before they have even touched the drinks he has just brought.
Boycie knew how big electric cars were going to be even back then . Still watch this every time it’s on
Boycie talking about the future is electric cars! How about that premonition from John Sullivan!
Brilliant only trig could do that!
Genuinely breaks my heart my partner don’t like only fools, she said “you watch the same episodes over and over” yh I known because they literally never get old.
They must have had to do many takes. How could they keep a straight face, when we are still laughing all these years after? 🤣😂🤣
What a wonderful time them old days were, maybe not perfect but it was ours and I bloody miss my home and country and people ☹️
Trigger is a great actor
Rip Roger loyd Pack, Kenneth MacDonald and John Challis, Legends.   Best comedy ever!!  RIP John Sullivan, thankyou creating so many years of entertainment with Fools and Horses for us all to enjoy.
Comedy at its best pure brilliance RIP trigger
Probably the best family comedy of all time IMO. I have happy memories of laughing along with my parents and grandparents, something you are hard pushed to do today. It’s obvious the Beeb is desperate for cash, but I think it is disgusting they have sold this gem off to the highest bidder so we have to pay to enjoy it still. It should be freely available rather than the banal tosh they seem to peddle now. Laughter would help us all in these Covid times
Grew up with them legends on the TV. Thank you for the great memories 💗
Trigger warning!
I must have seen this about four times and I’m still laughing at it
Excellent comedy, RIP Trigger and Boycie !!!
I get the feeling while any attempt to redo the series with new actors would be given a chance, trying to give us a new 'Trigger' just would not be accepted.  Roger Lloyd Pack took a funny character to incredible levels of humour and comedic timing. No-one else should even dare try to re-create this character.
Boyce knew electric cars were the future back in the 80's. That bloke just went up in my estimations 🎓😎
Electric cars? How old is this
If only fools is on.  You know I’m watching it. even if I’ve seen it a billion times !!
Can any body tell me which episode was this?
Comedy gold. Trigger and Boycie made this show great. RIP. X
Such an underrated scene!!!!
CLASSIC
Absolutely class
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😭
dont quarell about drinks baby"s .hmmm,grrrrrr,cheers and slanta,and what ever
30 years on and boyces investment in electric cars would still be struggling
Absolute magic it shows how good the BBC won't show it anymore
i miss funny shows .... this was epic
The ghost old days when comedy was comedy not like the crap you get now RIP Roger Lloyd pack
“ Lovely Jubbly “
Long LIVE Hookie STREET....🇯🇲🇬🇧❤️..Stand UP...WALLLLLL🦁🦁
The interactions between Trigger and Rodney were always the best, RIP Roger Lloyd Pack
RIP, Sullivan, Pack, Merryfield, Challis... the Barman.... who's left now?!
What a wonderful series by John Sullivan. He kept on churning them out. And to cop it all the cast was brilliant
Trigger for prime minister....wait, I think he alrady is, lol
One of the best comedy's ever made
I miss 1996 😪
OMG.
Was Boycie an early Tesla invester? 🤔
Trigger is my favourite character.
Total classic there you go Dave
What a classic X
That was brilliant 🤣
In Serbia even today "Only fools an horses" is such a joy to watch those re runs.Just brilliant..
This is proper comedy  "They've brought in a revolutionary new policy, from now on customers have to pay for their drinks!"
*R.I.P Trigger!* 😢
Elon Musk watched this episode as a little boy.
"I'm not on about model bloody racing cars for gawds sake"🤣... comedy perfection...
Back when comedy was great.
RIP Roger Lloyd Pack.  A man perfectly cast, with a perfect script.  This is a perfect storm of comedy.
Makes my Christmas every year
Classic British comedy. It was like no other. I say was, because cancel culture is eroding its finest.
This acting priceless 🤣
Trigger the road sweeper was the only one who ever had any money 🤣
See!  The magic of Trigger is that they didn’t overuse the character.
Tomorrow funny trigger was sumt never could u replace trigger
Anything with Trigger, is magic 🪄🤣🤣🤣
The writing is brilliant. Trigger is Perfection
Boyce was the originator of Tesla
Nothing has impacted society quite like this has, absolutely brilliant 👏
Trigger might be thick as two short planks, but he's a good bloke. R.I.P Roger Lloyd Pack.
Boycie going on about electric cars and look at us now.
For a whole decade, John Sullivan just kept coming up with comedy classic gold after classic gold after classic gold.  His Xmas specials were the only ones I looked forward to
Rum and blackcurrant for Bobby Crush over there.
Such brilliant writing
In the dictionary under 'genius' it says 'John Sullivan'
Dave looks smart in his suit
