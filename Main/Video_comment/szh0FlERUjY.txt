Been saying it for months, he is a mercenary, has no loyalty to the shirt. I hope he buggars off. He is constantly  inconsistent
There is no way Bruno starts for City or Chelsea. Heck, he couldn't even start for Portugal.
Pogba is the best midfielder we have.Wait until he has gone to PSG then everyone will realise how good he was.
Sell Pogba, sell the other deadwood and buy new blood. C'mon Man U, wake up...
Man U chiefs are pathetic. Pay the damn fee that Madrid wants and get Varane. He's worth it. Or else, other clubs will snap him...
selling pogba on the cheap is bad. we wont gain from him never have never will but having pogba and bruno in midfield is exactly what we have needed im sick and tired ov pogba this and pogba that every single transfer window if we was to sell him he would have went by now and if he dont renew his contract then psg will get him for free psg have always gotten players for free  because they are smart they got the best keeper in the world in my opinion for free
Mark if pogba goes and the club go pit and get Camavinga but the manager starts the season with mcfred how can you blame the club. It's the manager, Camavinga is better than mctominay and Fred but if the incompetence and favoritism and of the manager can't see that then he needs to go
Mark the players don't dictate the tempo. The manager does. Look at Liverpool. Klopp is always on the touch line shouting at his players to up the tempo. Ole boy sits on the bench waits for individual brilliance. Pep does it aswell. Top class managers do that. We have a below average one
And people need to stop this obsession with Grealish as a pogba replacement. Grealish is a LW or CAM. Not a box to box midfielder.
Mark ole has to come into the equation  His love for mcfred will cost us. Pogba leaving is a big blow but I would be more comfortable with Donny. Ole won't play Donny. That's on the manager. Even if Paul was to stay well all know ole would stick with mcfred because they are passion merchants
Mark if pogba was to go VDB should be his replacement but as you said. The Manager will pick Mcfred. Fans who want pogba to leave are simply haters. No matter what you think of him he makes the team better. I hope he leaves for his own good. When we have mcfred next season fans will appreciate him more
I respect pogba for not signing a new contract 👏. He is ambitious, he wants to win things and we ain't never winning anything under ole
Why would psg give their captain that’s worth 90mil for pogba who has a year left on his contract 🤣🤣😂
The more I listen to you Mark is the more I realise the problem is Ole and his bias English coaching staff cause if we sell Pogba Ole believe in his McFred and that is a disaster waiting to happen.. Hate that midfield two slow no creativity, no vision and dead ballers dead engine room
This channel is poison.  Absolute poison.
Just think how much more bruno has done in his first 6 months than pogba has done in 5 years.sad how he's getting so much headlines and drama and in out in out shake this nonsense all about
Hi
Varane is doing a Ramos on Utd for sure. Fernandes can easily replace Pogba in CM with VDB at 10 where he is most suited to play
Varane will not come
Swap pogba for veratti he's been making noise about blowing p.s.g's popstand
Celebrating Pogba leaving!!!! Hopefully it deals with the cultural rot within the squad and we can get some consistency and standards back at the club. Sad thing is that he wasn't sold last year when we could have got a good fee for him and not had to pay the useless (in a man udt shirt) guy.  If he runs his contract down and we don't throw him in the reserves...I actually will just stop caring about Ole's udt. Looking likely given Ole's track record :(
The moment I get excited for this season with almost strong complete team , and it starts to crumble   with Pogba wanting to leave
Get rid of pogba asap.....im so sick of this turd, inconsitent primadonna
Sell Pogba. He hadn't turned up for Manchester United, why do you think he played better than McFred when he hasn't
I think we need to sell pogba now and buy a CDM  Basically we have just attack minded players we need atleast one a little bit defensive minded. Coz both Maguire and Varane are long ball to Rashy and Sancho + they can carry the ball forwards.
virane not coming
so much for the 50 million bid you mention in the video the last day.
few days ago : pogba stays  now : pogba blow  to much news over here
What has Pogba done at man utd? yea he's good but not for us
If utd could get goretzka then it's fine pogba leaving. Goretzka is the better midfielder anyway. Pogba hasnt done enough since he came back. Goretzka can replace him no problem but i dout bayern will let him go.
Its a really bad if we dont sign CB.. Delay cause a lot of problem.... Building team need to be fast..... Really need expedite.. Player need more understanding.... Whoevsr want to go... Just let them go.... Man utd want to be champion next year
I feel pogba is holding out ro get the signings wee need b4 signing himself,  do or do not there's no Try he said
United should be concentrating on selling Pogba rather offering him a deal. I cant wait for Pogba to leave United to be honest. In my view Pogba is so overrated but apart from that, Pogba leaving would be a break from the toxicity of his agent Riola.
Get £45m for Pogba then get neves!
lets be honest overall pogba as been awful at utd... if can find club daft enuff to pay 50 mill then get rid.
This is good news to some of us who do not rate Pogba. Apart from the long range passes, Pogba offers united nothing. He is slow for the PL, not tenacious, he is not a hardworker and has poor agility. Very few games i have enjoyed watching Pogba playing for united to be fair. Pogba leaving could the best thing to happen to united apart from Jadon signing.
Let pogba enjoy his time in the farmers league
Sell Pogba asap.. we need players who give their all and love man Utd the way the class of 92 did... we can't hang on a player who has no best interest at heart for the team..
Pls let him go and buy two cms.
Please god let him finally go. The guy doesn’t want to be here. Good player. Terrible agent.
Looks like Mark woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
Pogba let he move
I think it will be good Pogba leaves Manu simply because he has lost the trust and confidence of majority of Unted fans. That has seriously affected his capacity and ability.  Can he turn around his current form if he stays beyond now? I am not sure so it is in the interest of all parties to part company.
Mark is getting so complacent with super chats. I love the show and Mark's the 🐐 but so many condescending answers to super chats.
Pogba is so overrated it’s untrue can’t wait for him to leave our football club he a joke wish we had a never signed him. I’d take 20p for him he a joke of a footballer
I’d rather have Mctominay than pogba any day
Pogba rejected a better deal He doesn’t want to stay. Get rid ASAP Good player but no legend  A handful of good games per season
Why are we arguing over a the fee? Arsenal paid £50 million for Ben White and we're stalling on paying the same for Varane. Pogba can go as soon as possible.
F>@k off Pogba
Phil Jones is back!!! He's the best trainer during gym session.
Totally Disagree with the Pogba situation. If he wants to go, let him go. What's the point of offering him a big contract, if in just 6 months/a year him and his agent would come out with stupid & disrespectful comments
United doesn't need Pogba. He's too slow and loses possession easily. Since project restart/his injuries united played better football without him. It's time to build a team ard bruno and not pogba. Get Philips and we r good!
Every decent Player rejects banter Club united
If we do pull in verane and pogba has a good last year with us and we win trophies he will sign a new contract
Swop deal with verrati
Alex Ferguson had bbbbs. That's why he was successful
Pogba gone =McFred whole season. This club is in a fucking mess worst midfield two in the Premier league
Nobody wants pogba let him go move forward.   His a good midfielder but if your mind is not in the club. What's the sense keeping him
Mark my friend don't live in hope .this man must go he causes too much headaches
Gatvol of pogba as we say in RSA
I Have been saying there's no chance United get Varane for the longest time?? People come out with these suggestions just to keep United relevant, where are there teams like Chelsea Liverpool in the city just get it done!! I love United but the owners in the board just got to go where the laughing stock of the Premier League on how we move in the transfer market.
We was always gonna loose pogba
So you got Sancho but pogba is going and varane is not confirmed..One step forward two steps backwards.  Seriuossssslly
This 60% max
"United through and through" is a good point.  The whole point about the Busby Babes and the Class of 92 was that they weren't just United through and through - they were also among the best players in the country / Europe.
United always do their business in august
Ole isnt a good coach lets be fair
I got tired of pogba sell him and play vdb 😒
Pogba isn't box to box.. He's a flamboyant, luxury playmaker. We play two CDMs precisely because he isn't that. That's not his game. So Grealish would be a fairly appropriate replacement. Or Camavinga.
Pogba is world class but he rarely puts his heart in the game. Same as martial. These players are better gone.
It is very simple.  If you want to keep Pogba, show him a project that can deliver titles and results for him.  The last and I think only title he has won is the Europa League with Mourinho as manager
let POGBA go ,we still have PHILL JONES
We are not getting Varane - get it through your head.
Mctominay > Pogba and fred
"LeT hiM rUN tHe CoNtRacT dOwn" Give me a break... really. Totally don't get the Pogba obsession. Just fucking sell him
What about gravenberch as a pogba replacement if he leaves
Sell Pogba sign Grealish
Mark's pissed because his 'Pogba will stay' schtick is evaporating and his 'Ole loves McFred and they will start next season' bullcrap is soon to go the same way.
Hey Mark
Finally Jadon Sancho has signed...here is an idea for a content Goldbridge....read out the names of all episodes mentioning jadon to utd in past one and half year...you will surely get bored 😁
Just get rid of pogba FFS
sell him now so we don't have a circus all season. It will be a drag on the team and Pogba will only perform now and then, and AS ALWAYS be very inconsistent throughout the season
Bla bla bla ...player want united not united want players...if we need a player we buy it ...fulll stop ...with this glazers we are like a poor club....city and chelsea dont speak more like us ...
Pogba,s been a total embarrassment  to Manchester United and himself. Real have stated yesterday they haven't had any contact at all from OT.
Managers won’t make a difference with the Glazer still owning the club. How have some united fans not got this through their thick skulls. SMH   Nothing has changed and nothing will change under the Glazers.  We are stuck with them indefinitely.
LESSGOOO SANCHOO OFFICIALLLL
yes leave pogba GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!
Box to box seriously have u watched him lately  if he loses the ball he never tracks back
Marks point doesn't stand.  If Pogba know that this is his year in man u and he will walk to any team with huge salary,  what will he do this year?  Play safe and stay from injury.  You won't see a great Pogba even you have him this year.
Everything good mark you sounded tired and irritated ? Also I still think varane will do a Ramos hope I’m wrong but I’m just not seeing this
Has pobga ever even won a champions league?
Who takes the first offer if they think they can get more? This is real life and any contract that Pogba signs whether it's with us or somewhere else it will be his last. Remember De Gea has been on £350K a week for the past 12 months. Pogba was never going to sign now for what De Gea has been on for 12 months. Remember these are just stories. When and if he signs we won't here it in the news first. This is the real circus when the media chucks stories out and fans bite. News people have been getting fat off this story since before Lukaku left.
the two dony and pogba difrent kind of players !!!!!
There’s just no excitement in our transfers anymore!.
Sancho ✅
So Sancho has finally been announced
with Pogba, he is a lazy player who like to play with so called world class players  ( france, juventus and now Paris, he always like it the easy way buh just letin him go will bring trophies to our club, mark my words
If United were serious about a real DM they'd be looking at Joao Palhinha.
Using Martial again????? It is worse than using MacFred..
Varane isn't signing for us and we aren't getting a CDM.  Obviously I want to be proved wrong
Here we go 5 Mll too much get a cheaper option or buy inJanuary desperation time.Jonesy recons United are going to gamble on his return and delay the Verane deal.Officially by somebody.
They just announced SANCHO!
Jason just announced officially!
Your thumbnails are as so predictable just like our club! You just recycle old headlines daily with changed names! Next week it will be, rice signs rice delay, rice bid accepted, rice worry, and finally rice deal falls through
Let's have it right we ain't signed anybody of merit yet ffs
they don't want to sign any other player in addition so they want to drag the varane deal till the last end
Its the coaches duty to up the tempo...
ITS OFFCIAL GUYS JADON SANCHO HAS JOINED MANCHESTER UNITED AS OF THIS MINUTE AND A OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION BY THE CLUB IS JUST MINUTES AWAY CONGRATULATIONS TO SOLSKJAER FOR THIS GREAT SIGNING. STAY TUNED TO FUTURE UNITED STAND COMMENTS AS I WILL BE POSTING UPDATES THERE😀😀
Who’s here after sancho signed
JADAN SANCHO GOT ANNONCED. FINALLY!!😭😂
YEESSSS SANCHO OFFICAL
Sancho announced
Mark,sometimes it would be more productive to not make a video regurgitating what we already have known all week..🤦🏻‍♂️
Sancho has been announced
I was ur 3000 like
So City getting Grealish who we should’ve gotten last year until Pogba decided not to go.  Smdh United’s done.  Bloody joke club
Just play vdb in the pivot of Pogba goes I don’t see it as a massive issue, he’s a quality player and needs a chance
All next season is going to be pogba pogba pogba.  I hope we can just loan him out or sell him or put him in reserves.    We have seen with previous players like herrara. When they sign for another team. Ole wont play them. I hope he does the same with pogba
Really couldn't care less if pogba leaves, United will go on. He's been trying to leave for ages let him go.
People saying 'sell Pogba' need to understand that United can't sell Pogba unless he agrees to it. Nothing can change this situation this season unless both sides agree. Equally, Pogba can't force a sale either. So either both sides agree something this year, or the contract ends next year. Those are the only two outcomes.
Lukaku trained alone and In around for ages while waiting for inter to come to agreement with Utd varane will happen it’s all negotiations now and poker remember we are dealing with a terrorist in Perez 🤣🤣
People are really saying "Varane is staying" bs🤣, maybe he will if Real Madrid offers him what he wants. Real Madrid offering 8 mill, United offering 12 mill
Pogba can go, stop scaring us
Taking about  a prats must be looking in the mirror .
So Pogba rejected a new deal Varane deal is at risk over 5m  No deadwood sold Mata and Grant got new contracts to be cheerleaders Camavinga turned Utd down  But according to twitter, Murtough and Fletcher are "doing a madness"  🤣🤣
Let Pogba go....  united is bigger than pogba ..... we were already sucessful before pogba and united will be successful after him
Varane ain't coming
Thanks for telling them Grealish isnt a Pogba replacement Mark. Wth are we going to do with Grealish Fernandes and VDB 🤣🤣🤣
Get rid of POGBA now before I do.!!!!!
Varane is not coming to Man United???
Pogba has always stated he wanted to leave and yall still jump and social media  and criticize him. He stated his intention more than once  and yall actblike he betrayed the club. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ Ander Herrera stated how much he loved United up until his contract was over  and he just walked away. And yall still love Herrera 😂😂. Yall come like "pogba needs to go" ,"get him out" . He wants to leave 😅🤣🤣. You'd be doing him a favor u fools.
Mark you really need to cut it be realistic, pogba has to go, yes a lot of us don't like the mcfred midfield but we are just tired of po ga. Let him go
We have to face it Mark if the side is as it is now and we don't get Varane or a CDM, we are using McFred and Ole will be gone by Christams.
Business glazer Vs business riaola/pogba
You need a proper manager,
And as for you Mark, you need to trust the other players we have in the squad.
Preston North End 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
This is Man Utd so nothing is quick, we all thought that was Woodward’s fault but it is clearly the Glazers
We either play and pay pogba for another year and hope he performs for the season and maybe we're successful. Or get 40/50 mil now and remove his wages of say 12 million. So we could save 60 mil if we sell now. The club and ole need to just bite the bullet and sell him. Player gets what he wants and club look strong rather than begging to stay or loosing for free in a year.
Seems like Pogba wants to run his contract down. Get rid of him. Mark so u would rather pogba goes for free next season.
how could we sell pogba for 50m but have to buy varane for more???? nothing makes sense with united’s transfer business
Soon players will all run contracts down and have all the power! I believe Pogba has to leave if only for this circus around Riola and Pogba stops
Never talked so much about a Utd player leaving or staying as much as Pogba. Fair enough when it was Ron who gave us so much but Pogba leaving could really be the making of us
Pogba is a good player not world class, world class is Zidane, Scholes, Messi, Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, Rivaldo, Romario, Giggs, Hagi, Okocha, Ronaldinho...
If we keep Pogba  when he wants to leave what’s to say he will be arsed when he plays
2:55🤭
It’s been nothing short of a circus with Pogba ever since he came back, every transfer window is all about him and his fat rat agent. Get rid of him while we can he’s not worth the hassle, I can count on the fingers on one hand the amount of great performances he’s had over the last few years
People Need To Stop Talking About Ole Replacement He Aint Going Anywhere
Sell or drop. Do him like Abromavich done Carvahalio
Why do United not swap Pogba and Varane?
Pogba does not have the stamina to even play in the premiership
Let him go to psg who cares we've lost and got rid of better. The drama he and riola cause its better to let him go.
Mark seemed in a really bad mood today
Im sorry but i will not miss Pogba as much he was a good player yes but only because we didn't have any real quality players much changed when Bruno arrived and we saw what a top player can do vs the Average guys.
I have a feeling Varane will stay ffs. Our club is just slow. GLAZERS OUT!!
This club is being run by moron ,no need for all this online media transfer ,you can get things done underground and announce once the paperwork is completed.
Just sell Pogba, absolutely sick of the saga, if he is deliberately running his contract down just let him rot in reserves.
Can someone explain what Goretzka is good at other than bodybuilding? From what I've seen he's the German McTominay.
do you need to hit the table to make a point?
Pogba want to go... Then no need to stop him....he has no heart anymore. Buy better attacking mid, we dont want to have diva here.. Man utd can be better without him...
Sell pogba and get some young talent in. I wouldn't feel this way if Pogba played well every game. He only performs 50% of his games the rest he is average at best the other 50%. Why pay them wages for a player like that.
Lingard needs to play instead of pogba
Varane to Real Madrid Pogba to PSG  move on...
I woant be suprised when we win things without him
Ive mostly aligned with Mark’s opinions, very pragmatic but this one on Pogba is kind of really really disappointing. Didnt we have Pogba last year and yet ole still played McFred (and there is a reason for it with Pogba sometimes being a liability at times in midfield). Rather focus on the future - Pogba is not Manchester United material.
If Goretska is to replace pogba next season and it happened it would actually be good business
Sancho deal (t shirt hold up) is been delayed so the Glazers have something to show come the end of the window and they haven’t signed Varane or anyone else for that matter.
Get hallard next season as replacement for Cavani
I'm curious as to what's happening with the Glazers out movement
Mac Fred in the midfield next season for United! I'm loving it..... 🤣🤣👍🍻
I'd rather let Pogba rot in the reserves than the glazers get 50mil in their pockets
It is time to sell Paul Pogba. He will probably leave next year for free so it is better to give a chance to a player who wants to stay at the club, next season.
Another transfer window and another opportunity for Pogba and his agent to get a pay rise out of united ..  Time for board to call his bluff and sell him to PSG and let him rot in a second rate league
Get PP out.....what has he done for man utd  anyway? Why so desperate to retain someone who dont want to play for us?
Don't need him anyway!
i watched the best player in the world leave my club in 2009, im not worried about pogba
Why does £40 million = dull? Plenty of players out there.
Pogba not signing and Varane not coming.....😂😂
If he doesn't want to be here. Why would you want to keep him!
If we don't sell Pogba with his wages he would cost us approx £50m+ for the season! Would we loan in the best player in the world and pay him £4-5m a month, no we wouldn't... Cash in and use donny more
You seriously would keep a player who doesn’t want to be here for another year to allow him to go free? Naa id rather sell now even if we dont replace him Id like to replace Pogba this window but  the last thing you would want is a player with Raiola as agent who doesnt want to be here and then to see him get played over players who want to play for the badge will be an injustice
Your spot on about the United through and through thing , it’s because back in the 90s  loving the club and having a good attitude was all that was needed to make it in the game but football has moved on and evolved.  Mctominay is a perfect example, good lad , loves the club , great attitude works hard and follows instructions well , his off the ball work, workrate and stamina is second to none, the trouble he’s is AWFUL with the ball , he’s slow, takes too many touches , doesn’t see forward passing lanes quickly enough , on top of that he’s is so obvious and predictable on the ball and telegraphs everything he does with the ball that stevie wonder could intercept his passing.  The reality is he wouldn’t make the team , bench or matchday squads for any top6 side and would struggle for game time at with with over half of the premier league sides too, we keep him around for the the wrong reasons and if he had a top top manager in charge he’d end up being moved on to Crystal place or West Brom.
Let paul pogba go and look for sameone else. Manutd for life.
Failed at United, couldn't turn up in a europa league final against nobodies, juventus won without him, now he wants to Jog off to a super team to disguise his inability to actually play the game of football. How fans can't see this mercenary for who he is, I'll never know.
I agree he better go for free that 40 mil
Why you keep on saying Fred is no good we finished second last season and went behind and we didn't lose all last season away in prem
I spoke to Varanasi last night. He wants the big bucks from Us as his pre-retirement payout. However, he does not want to be stuck with Ole.
Sancho, Varane and Neves in. Pogba of significance out. Cant see us challenge for the two titles that really matters.
we need a cdm now even if pogba stays so if pogba goes we need another md so if he leaves and we bring in no one its a terrible window that holding role is the most important signing
When Pogba signed all them years ago, I could see him not signing a new contract and the fact the club extended his deal would have pissed him off. Personally I'd be happy to see him move on so we can focus on building a squad that A) wants to be here and B) will challenge for honours. I'm not saying Pogba is a bad player at all, he's quality but I think we can replace him with other players. Ole is building something here and I feel we shouldn't have to rely on Pogba
I will chose pogba sold for 50 mil and not spend it... Remember Fred got a consistent chance only because of injuries, probably if pogba is not here, it will be easier for donny to get into the team
I can't see how it would be beneficial to us to keep a player for a year especially he's not committed playing for us. I love PP & would be sad to see him go but it's better for us to move on imo
man let him go already, we can play VDB in his position, he well be more effective, and more complementary to Bruno and whoever is gonna play in the MCFred Duo.
Si aende tuuuuu
But if Pogba goes for free is that is a respected way towards MAN U T D   what do you think  Mark
transfer window for Manchester United seems to be closed...we will have same old set of players with Sancho added on
Let pogba go to the farmers league. Premier league is getting stronger and stronger, and what does he do, runs away.
When you say put varane and top class cdm and we can put pogba in middle, we will play better football, we played with pogba on midfiled wih bruno rashford cavani Greenwood, everyone in europa final, we played poorly even with all the posession and attacking options, that s not just one game
Pathetic!
Keeping a player who wants out just means you set yourself up for failure. It's not about pride. I like Pogba, but if we play Pogba for a year, McTominay and Fred will play after that. Manchester United need to identify the flaws in the squad. Because Pogba being the strength in the midfield means the following season Manchester United will be shite. I'd rather be crap until Christmas than be okay for the season then go into the following season with McFred and without seeing the team without Pogba and knowing what to change and add.
People don’t realise how good pogba is pogba does play well and when he leaves people will realise how good he was for us
Surely Solskjear has to play Donny with Mctominy, they are both box-to-box but have less inclination to get foward that Pogba so could share the defensive role
If that's the case why did he buy donny ????
players can force a move if they want it
To be honest pogba can go for me no player is bigger than the club we should be asking more than 50 million play donny he will come good the more games he gets
Varane has already left valdebas
Being owned by businessmen is why they should sell Pogba. Starting with Pogba just creates a hole when Pogba goes. Manchester United won't be prepared to replace him. Playing without him can show the staff the flaws in the squad. If Pogba helps us win trophies and goes on a free, fair enough. I don't think that will happen.
Varane to remain at R.M & PP to PSG this season. Ruben Neves to United.
Should never of got pogba anyway. Overrated and been nowt but trouble since he came. Hope he does f**k of to PSG another player who thinks he's bigger than the club
How pogba is a World Class player is beyond me... He is probably the only player who can be called world class without performing consistently
"He wants to leave our football club" "He doesn't want to play for our football club" Me:🥲
Mark is talking bollox about pogba
About 90% sure Ancelotti will convince Varane to stay
I thought we should have sold pogba last summer. He always seemed like he wasn't happy and had other ambitions. What his agent did before the leipzig match didn't surprise me and there's been that undercurrent throughout the season that he wants to leave. We should sell him this summer and I would take £40-50m for him, then use that to go and buy a cdm type player like Bissouma.
Hey Mark!!!! Are you still in the Varane 90% club???
Mark....listen to other people's opinions like we have to with yours.
swap him with Paredes. get tielemans or Neves sorted
Varane transfer setback Varane transfer blow Varane transfer delay Varane transfer meltdown  Varane transfer danger Varane transfer risk We will hear all these......."mark" my word.
AND new player coaches, then i would offer Mata and Matic as first team ones. They would do a far better job than the existing ones.
All these problems we have will only be solved after we fix one thing... GlazersOut! The board will follow.
Neves is Premier league proven. Kamavinga is too young and too much of a liability. Neves has got a lot more to offer at a lesser price.
Pogba can go
Donny needs games he's not getting the chance because he's not an ole favourite
What a team PSG will be! Pogba, Verratti, Gini in the midfield, a top keeper for free! Neymar and Mpabbe. United’s midfield will be so crap if no signings are made.
Paul Pogba is welcome to join PSG ... im tired of issues and discussions about Pogba ... let him leave ... let DVB quietly and effectively take Pogba's position and let the team go on more quietly about their business of winning. Enough of Paul Pogba!
Pls pls pls let this over rated arganet puffda leave united 😡😡😡😡😡😡
We don't need a replacement get donny in there
Let’s be realistic here.. it’s still early in the transfer window, let’s not be critical until the season starts. Most big clubs haven’t made any signings
Van De Beek will fill PP slot no problem. We have the young players like Dialo or from the Academy to bring through.
Pogba is a luxury player. If you already have a world class team and want some fancy flicks and passes in your game pogba is your guy.
If he don't leave , united should not play him for the entire season.
If united don't let him go this summer. They would be so stupid. Sancho can play Midfield.  And sign another winger
Paul Pogba is a consistent peformer  for France. Unfortunately, same can't  said about him for united.
So what's all delay all about... On varane. More delays will mess it up
I have never liked Pogba.. he is an ABSOLUTE CHILD. He’s been saying he wanted to leave Man Utd since last January. Then he said in February last year that he did not want to leave then in March he said he wanted to leave then his rat of an agent made things worse and then Pogba came back saying he did not want to leave… POGBA you want OUT?! You moron there is the door…
I hope Pogba becomes our Coutinho and we win big trophies after he leaves or gets sold. Pogba isn’t that important of a player that we can’t cope without him.
Pogba out neves in..  Fred out cama in
Love the way you have a go at media and Utd for putting bullshit headlines out and you do the same! Hypocrite
I told you that would happen…Man Itd were nowhere near signing Raphael Varane the other day mark despite your claim that his signature was done and dusted
On ya bike 🚴🏾 pogba
Sell POGBA.
My God PP bs again. Why does mark feel we NEED to replace the PP? Grab whatever we can get for him and run.
Varane will remain at R.M. Said it over a month ago.
Considering Pogba played as a right and left winger last season, can we say his replacement is Sancho?
People saying it’s Mino Riola, not Pogba. When has Pogba ever quashed any rumours of him leaving. When there were rumours of VDB leaving he came out said those rumours were complete bullshit, Pogba has not done that. He just lets them hang there to spread doubt. Get him out of my club. 🐍 🐍 🐍
Get lost Pogba
I actually really hope PSG actually sign pogba this season I really can’t be bothered with it all now and I definitely didn’t want him to stay for a year because every day will get story’s pogba staying pogba going just no. Its actually crazy how people actually lose their minds of the thought of pogba leaving like Manchester United are going to be relegated no Manchester United have seen wold class player leave before and guess what we are still here
lol started the summer strong, now everything is slowly going away (camavinga, varane, trippier, when tf is sancho being announced). Typical united
Are there people really scared Varane won’t come because he went to training. He’s legally required to do so, and he didn’t even train he just went there to do some medical tests.
If pogba stays without signing this club will get disrespected for a full season. I'm not bothered about the glazers getting disrespected but the constant circus around the club only makes it harder to do well.  Couldn't care less if he goes. Rather have everyone on board with the project.
