here after the suspect was caught smh 🫣 2 days after this update he gets pulled over for driving too close to a semi and driving away like if nothing has happened 😳 sickening
Take down the crazy video post of Tarot Card readers on youtube. They are accusing outright and need to stop with the hocus pocus.  Also...... others who are posting themselves....' I didn't do it' are trying to clear themselves.  Contact them to come in for lie detector test and get a DNA swab. So can be cleared correctly. with finger prints. If they refuse. A suspect for sure
Moscow PD, you are supported. Thank you for working so hard.
Moscow law enforcement are doing a great job!
Idaho law enforcement are doing a great job!
GO TO YOUTUBE A FASTER WAY TO FIND A SERIAL KILLER AND MISSING CHILDREN  WITH THIS CAMERA SYSTEM IN ALL COMMUNITIES.  WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE POLICE.  A SERIAL KILLER AND MISSING CHILDREN WILL BE FOUND FASTER.  ON EVERY CORNER HOUSE WE ARE STARTING TO SEAL OFF THE AREA GIVING THEM  NO PLACE TO HIDE.  NO ONE CAN ENTER IN OR OUT WITHOUT BEING RECORDED.  CONFIRM TO SEE IF THIS IS A GOOD OR BAD IDEA.
Why did it take so long to ask for videos ong roads. Another taking the cars away. I hope to a secure place. Many issues I see slipped by investigation
I think there were alot of mistakes. Just like the car.How far to people report awhile Elantra. California. I spotted 2 this week on the 210 E in San Bernadino
Why bother having this doofus clown-cop on? Are you kidding me?
Those cops are bumpkins
Thank you.    We don't have jack shit
Was it a rental car'?
People why is there not more video cameras we all have phones bought your kid a phone why aren’t you buying a video cameras to keep them safe at their homes they need video cameras inside and out lights that turn on when somebody’s around steel bars that go inside of your sliding glass doors they need pepper spray on their keys they need to sleep with their keys and if they hear something they can push the alarm on their car if they have a garage they need a video camera in there parents please keep your children safe to many of them are being killed and are dying some of this would be a great Christmas present keeping your kids safe I don’t know why there wasn’t more cameras or the building was secured by a company connected to the police I have eight cameras on around my house I have lights that pop on if they see motion I have eight video cameras outside at and the other place is not in the bathrooms but my bathrooms don’t have any windows around my house I have bushes that have stickers on them on my windows I have bars that step two sideways if you decide that she needs fresh air you could put those on the top of your window and I would leave it open a little bitch deadlocked a really important cameras inside it out of her apartment and I have a dog that would probably kill somebody if they keep in the house I have to put them away the work my grandkids come he’s very protective over me this is a great time to buy security stuff for your children is a great time to bring safety to their life to really kids or die
WHITE ELANTRA DMV RECORDS. University Parking Permits (Murderer will be Hiding Car) MURDERER SHOULD TURN himself IN it is OVER. SECURITY CAM at 4AM on his Escape ROUTE.  👉MOSCOW has his ESCAPE ROUTE on SECURITY CAMS. MOSCOW CHECK YOUR CAMERAS CATCH THIS SOB!!!![the Stalker. HER Friends Know who the STALKER is, When Women are AFRAID they TALK] STALKERS Don't just STALK 1 Woman, they STALK more.(CARS need GAS License Plate on Gas Station CAMS) what Elantra is getting Gas on this DATE
What about white Hyundai Elantras in Ontario Canada?
Somewhat understandably, most of the misinformation in this case originates from the Moscow PD.
This is why inrlieve. Everybodies dna.should be recorded at birth it vouldmake prople to.decide not to commit.certaincromes while it'd just athought
Jack d did this asleep is not a good alibi he is the only one with the motive he lived within 200 feet she was leaving him and he was obsessed jd did this I’d bet anything on it and I believe also jd was at food truck not js
The update is we have no update. The end. We’ll check back in next week with nothing else new and continue to botch this investigation with completely unnecessary press conferences. Thank you, stay tuned.
Wait a min? So….homicide investigations DO take time? Hmmmm. Every time the victims are minorities the claim is the cops don’t care. I’m confused lol. 99% of racist allegations are just examples of things that happen to all people but the moment they happen to “them” the focal point is shifted to identity. Note to all apolitical people. It’s a lie.
Bring in a VALID  physic police investigater like Dorothy who has passed now...but helped police solve many murder crimes...a legit one can start to lead the detectives in the right direction.
Buy a damn firearm. Let's all do that.
The murderer watches all the news story's I'm a phycic medium in UK I think he's gonna do it again or already had copies Bundy and the night stalker
God bless u so much I can't help but it's a copycat serial killer .
There's no way 1 person could have done it. There most likely more people involved.
This is a difficult case and all law enforcement involved are doing their best jobs for these victims and families. For family members to be constantly questioning police in the media as to their diligence does not help. One in particular comes to mind. The killer is reading and watching and loves seeing police ridiculed. Do not feed the monster.
God bless the law enforcement. In  m Moscow Idaho and the USA. Guide them. To catch the killer. My high respect to all. And God bless our troops and veterans home front. God bless our USA.
Does anyone  know if there has been any conversations from people that might know the person who drives the white car?
Never going to get solved
MORMON MAFIA MOSCOW POLICE DEPARTMENT protecting JACK S (Mormon rich parents). Sad world, they have the suspect 💯 %. The big dude talking with JACK S at the food truck is also a SUSPECT  💯 %. Mark my words people. They know soooooo much more than what is said publicly. This may be labeled a cold case for nefarious reasons. Sick.
Dennis Hopper look alike….sad case❤️‍🩹
Obviously  waukesha is cursed like hell...
The fact that they haven't found the car and the owner of the car that was in that area on the night in question and not coming forward on his own just means that the individual is part of the scene and not just an individual who might of seen something.
This guy is so incompetent it's no joke.
Another Dateline episode in the making... SO much evil in this world.  That's why I don't believe in aliens... no other life can be so cruel, just humans
💘
There is seriously way to much wrong with this world and the simple truth is because there's entirely way to many people in this world.
There would have been blood everywhere outside ? Did they have blue light pick up blood outside or dogs
https://youtu.be/-LlY98SKmh4
They have failed us in solving this.
There never goin too catch the person or people!
Word is the fbi is working with a secret gov agency on this and that this was an alien abduction gone wrong😮 👽
"Ultra Kill"
I just wonder about that white Hyundai there aren't that many out there between 2011 and 2013. I would imagine that they could at least do a DMV search of every white Hyundai Elantra that is regiatered at least in that general part of the country. Now I'm thinking the killer is from out of the area.
be aware every day.  but what he is saying is, watch your back because we don't know who did this.  situational awareness is something you learn when you are learning gun education.  carry a gun, know how to use it.  it is your federal constitutional right.
You’ll never catch them
It’s bad that it’s online tips it shows how people are afraid and don’t trust going to the police
Terrible Crime Captain  Roger Lanier Thank you  Sir for your  value information , my heart broken it is a  terrible  and horrific crime passionatal
So, nothing.
These are the most clueless cops I have ever seen
Thank you for all you and your department are doing.
Its a shame & its sad why people have to be so mean & violent??? I don't understand
Oof, that really didn't sound like law enforcement has much to work on.
is this channel real or a relabel source? please lmk
It’s the neighbor. He knows he didn’t cut himself, he knows he was well dressed and didn’t leave any hair or touch dna. Whatever he did with his outfit he killed them in needs to be found out. That’s the big ticket to break this open. He’s too weird…
Always lock your doors. Get a security system and USE IT. there are many affordable options. Get a dog and leave them in the living room or near entry points of your home. Life is precious and there are evil people out there that want to take it from you. Protect it
Antinatalism is the ethical view that negatively values procreation and concludes that procreation is morally wrong under all circumstances. The justifications are: harm/suffering prevention, the questionable nature of gambling with another life, & the impossibility of consent to be born.  In summary:  1. There's no reason to create a child that’s for the child's sake. For the potential child, birth doesn't solve any problem that it doesn't first create.  2. Existence is imposed without consent. No one chooses to be born or chooses the circumstances of their birth.  3. Everyone experiences at least some suffering, and some people experience disproportionately more suffering than others.  4. Existence brings guaranteed harm for unneeded benefit—guaranteed harms being: pain, fear, worry, sickness, injury, grief/loss, fatigue, etc.  5. Bringing someone into existence means exposing them to all the harms of this world. It should go without saying that the presence of harm is bad.  6. The only way to guarantee that your kids won’t ever suffer is by never bringing them into this world in the first place, making the absence of harm good  7. Even though there is good in this life, the unborn aren’t deprived of anything since they don’t exist to miss out on said good, therefore the absence of pleasure is neutral (neither good nor bad)  8. No one has the moral right to inflict serious, preventable harms upon others without their consent.  9. Intentional procreation is intentionally harming your loved ones, a questionable deed?  10. It’s morally questionable to place someone in a position from which death is the only escape…  11. None of the nonexistent wish to be born but plenty of the living wish they'd never lived!
Thank you Captain Roger for taking the time to speak regarding the unfortunate deaths of the college students.  Too many people call with false information that does set back the investigation.  Praying for the loved ones who are grieving 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I have no details at all other than what I'm hearing here right now ..I haven't been paying attention to news.
12:37
Sadly . . . America has become Lawless. No fear of our weak, outdated penal-system. We need to put "Hi-Def" Camera's EVERYWHERE. The camera Never-lies and if you are Innocent, (or Guilty) there will be clear footage. I hope & pray they can get some justice and closure, for the grieving loved-ones.
Possible Serial killer is on the loose.
They know who did it, he basically said it but they want to make sure there is no way a defense can come back to dismantle the case
No parents should ever have to bury their child. 😭
So in other words they don’t know anything at all and the case is officially a cold case. Great Job officers.
As an expert in data management, i know for certain that you are not even trying.  Edit; you could easily find this man through cell tower geofencing. The same way you caught the January 6th insurrectionists. Do not lie to me.
rip bozo ratio L L L L L L L L
Sounds like this will be good material for Hollywood
Wow they spent HOURs. I hope he meant days or weeks worth of sorting evidence.
God's speed! 🙏
Wow, looks like this will be an unsolved case. Pretty sad.
I know nobody should ever be murdered.  I really don't understand how someone could do something like this during the holidays.  😭. Wreaking havoc on so many, ppl in the 🌎 are fuqtup these daze 😭. May GOD be with ALL parties involved 🙏. S I.P 💕
Y'ALL show the same repetative BULLSHIT. FBI STILL getting calls REROUTED to the Dept of Healthcare? Fake ASS investigation..fake ass law enforcement. You want EVIDENCE get the tapes from A&E 48 hrs where you PLAN THESE ppls murder and then do it. That's ILLEGAL, UNLAWFUL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL Y'ALL record everyone EVERYDAY QUIT LYING MOFOS
It should not take this long to catch the evil monster. Hope there is closure soon
Hey yall Is there a link to  the original story and whatnot to see what this update is all about because I ain't seen the origional story
I have about a 1:3 theory. The NSA knows every person who was located in a square block of the murders, but they aren’t supposed to. What they do when they want to bust a drug dealer is give the local LEOs unconstitutionally obtained evidence that they cannot use in court or even show a judge. If it’s unconstitutional? It’s very highly illegal. Because there’s so much notoriety and noise about this event , the NSA has given local LEOs the info and they must develop evidence parallel without divulging that they actually got it from NSA. Now NSA doesn’t care about murders. This might get the admiration of foolish people who praise unconstitutional means. Then they have a breakthrough. Hint: you can’t murder 4 people and leave no evidence. You cannot leave evidence that the NSA cannot get. They watch everyone.  Illegally and don’t fall for them . They are evil
Just heartbreaking. Prayers to the families.
I thought they already solved this
What all these people said...so sad.
Moscow idaho....hell of a name
Check the neighbors ok
Thank you all who are helping.Condolences to the families ❤️
God bless you all at this tragic time am sure they are doing everything they can to find this or theses people who done this despicable act to 4 young beautiful human beings with loving families 👪 ❤️ peace to you ❤️
Remove the FBI if you want it solved
Thank you for continuing this investigation. Prayers go out to the families.
This is ridiculous. The ONLY reason this is national news is because the victims were attractive, popular people. If it were average people this either would not even be KNOWN about or ignored after one day. This happens in this country every day. All your comments of “outrage” and “prayers”….spare me. Start giving a damn about everybody.
.#zZz#.⚡⬆️⬇️💀☢☣....НАЭКСПЕРЕМЕНТИРОВАЛИСЬ???!.💀⚡⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫💀💀💀💀⚡⚡⚡
Praying you can do great work in the near future.My Dad was in the FBI for 30 years.Tough case for sure.May Jesus bless your work.
Naming it the King Road homicide and Murders this Late in the Game is Telling. Lots of little things tell us these small town cops have screwed up since day one, too bad they didn't ask for help from the FBI early. This guy just told us this community is still at great risk and the killer or Killers are still in the immediate area. The Killer knew his victims intimately, he had been inside this multi story house before.
Thank You! For the update on this Sad Case Officer! Justice is coming ⚖️
I hate to say this but the police in Idaho seem incompetent and incapable of completing the investigation. Just saying.
I had to skip through the last half of the video it was so stupid. So unless I missed it, the update was that there was no update?
You know what, some of the comments about this cop and his blinking and putting ANY blame, well, it's just sick and no wonder our country, and the world, is deteriorating.  And while I support (not ALL cops), and back the blue, it is so hard to trust anyone these days.  I don't understand why the good, cave, or are afraid or whatever, but there is so much corruption and sneakiness about so much, that you just can't trust anyone anymore.  Commiecrats have ruined our country, taken away our ability to say the truth, there are cover ups, and the FBI is just about the worst of them all.  I don't know who killed these innocent kids, and it IS weird the other 2 were left alone, but something is strange.  And for a perfect example, look at the Pelosi cover up.  Can't even trust police anymore.
If I were to investigate this I'd look at bus routs. This person was more than likely a vagrant who rode in and did what they did. Then they blended in play sight to get away. The new Jack the Ripper.
I would guess that the crime was done by the roommates, plus a group of friends. Maybe up to 10 people at the house involved. Especially since stab wounds do not match for people laying on the same bed. Mysterious instagram post or whatever by one of roommates at strange hours supports this theory. Psychic-wise, I agree that the formal days before was motive to the disorganized, impromptu killings. I get this feeling like “she keeps having people over… and more $ than me.” Just a hunch…
God Bless the families of these victims and all who are involved in solving this case@ o know the holidays are going to be rough as they are for me as well as I have list my entire family but we must remember Jesus is the reason for the season! God Bless you all  and be with you every step of the way!!!
Is this the four murders at the college campus? It's a shame.
Don't care but  . I will be looking out.
this  fake reality fake holographic  realm   is very evil and wicked its all over i am just waiting for the Fireeeeeeeeeeee!!!! )
Prayers to the Moscow Police and the victims and families.  RIP
Look directly at the ex boyfriend that’s who.
Excessive blinking is a sign of guilt. Investigate this man!
Roger is looking awfully guilty. Where was his ass that morning?
Sad, nothing stay with the friends ....
People just don’t understand the pressure and the proceedings of these certain cases LE does everything in a form in matter where everything they do has full effect on getting a crucial conviction that can’t be overturned The parents might be anxious to get this solved but everyone should just do their part stop spreading misinformation as facts all we have is a bunch of speculation and opinions coming from peoples personal bias and it may all be one huge Case That has a lot of history connected to it
What happen to forensics
Are they sure these people weren't mauled to death?
Pretty sure this video confirms they have who did it just needs overwhelming evidence.. also the white car has some significance prob someone who gave the murder a ride, or is friends with the person. At this point if you have a white car and haven’t come to the police and say hey yeah this might be my car.. :something is up. Just my take
God bless you Captain and your Department.
Yes there is alot of info and you say you have alot of people so why is it taking so long and by the time you sort through and analyze everything the leads will be cold hrs of video of one day have had days to watch and analyze but we will believe you just don't have anything new so thanks
Bottom line you have nothing to say.
Very nice speaker, clear and too the point. Thanks
Idaho is a very conservative state in regard to homosexuality.  Those 2 girls were quite obviously gay and not just friends but lovers.  There could be a connection with this and to the murder.
Oh my God these cops are fucking horrible. No updates just “we have a bunch of evidence”. Good do something you shitheads. They’ve spent more time trying to get people to feel bad for them than actually solving the case. Gotta be a cover up or something because they can’t be this evil and stupid.
Dr. Phil thinks that an incident 3 miles from these murders could be related. A dog was skinned. I hope the police will investigate this incident to see if it is related. These evil kind of people often hurt animals 1st.
I'd be looking across the border into the relative communities of Washington...
It appears he is lost unsure.
Wow such bullshit. They are lost.
Why is he blinking so much? Strange.
💔 so very sorry for you losses.
https://youtu.be/y8XCOgZqGAk
Perhaps you need to start from the beginning. You shouldn’t rule out people. This is probably someone that knew them in some way.
I think the investigators, police officers,  all the staff assistants are truly working so diligently.  Much gratitude to them.
Let's be real ,the killer got off clean. He's definitely not in the area and probably not the state. He's a modern day serial killer ,this is very rare.
Friendship is not the same anymore. That’s all
He is lying! They are taking us down a rabbit hole. I have always thought it was more than one killer! Guess what? The cops and the University know that as well. They are not being truthful about these horrible murders for the sake of the University. However, they are taking for granted these killers are walking around freely and will do it again if they are not caught! The police know! They know. It is time to take the globes off and hold the University and the police accountable.....   Lastly, those two roommates left alive is very awkward. Something about that is suspect.
Madison was riotously beautiful! And remember the Delphi murders? It got solved albeit it took six years!
THIS IS THE NEW AMERICA EVERYONE GET YOUR PROTECTION IT GOING TO GET WORSE...
I’m praying for the families of Xana, Madison, Kaylee & Ethan!! I know the killer(s) will be brought to justice, I just feel it!! I hope people aren’t calling/emailing tips that are based on the rumors & narrative from online ‘sleuths’ because that takes up precious time that LE could be investigating real tips!! We all want this case solved but listening or putting out assumptions & speculations is extremely counterproductive!!! Prayers for all LE involved in this case!!
The killing of these four young college students has my heart broken.  The thought of sleeping in your home and someone coming in to stab you to death is horrific.  May these four Angels Rest Peacefully in Paradise.  Father please comfort their families and friends as only You can.  Amen.
I pray so hard that they will find the killer
There were multiple targets and that rules out an ex-boyfriend because typically an ex would target just one or the parents but I guess the roommates could be targeted if the ex blamed them for the breakup.  My theory on who murdered these people is that it's somebody who lives close by who was angry at the people in the home for being loud with the parties.  A neighbor would be able to walk a short distance without being seen, committing the acts and then fleeing to a safe house close by and cleaning up the blood.  Perhaps the person was sleeping in their home close by and was woken up by the young college kids in the early morning and had enough of them, went and grabbed a weapon and murdered them.  Either that, or the person nearby has some sick kind of fascinations with horror type movies and acts and they wanted to be the killer targeting the typical victims that are in these movies.  That is the kind of profile I feel like is the killer.  There are so many cameras nowadays I think it would be hard for somebody to go do a crime like this and not be seen with blood stains and scratches etc.  That is why I think it is somebody who lives close by.
Monday morning, amid ongoing protests
This is what happens when Andy has to solve a murder, they are going to blame a Native..just watch.
Stay strapped.   Be sure to carry a  👉🏼💥 at all times.  Some people don't want you to be able to defend yourself (or your loved ones) or have any chance at survival and they LOVE to pretend they have your well being and best interests at heart at all times.   Liars.  Stay safe, be careful out there everybody. I am hoping for the best for all.
Sooo.. who done it?
If my stalkers know where I am (among many other very intimate details) and I know who they are..   I know beyond a shadow of doubt they shouldn't have hardly any trouble finding who murdered these kids.  There's good and bad in all. Who is going to prevail..
Pathetic Police Department
Yeah, we will all pray that criminal will give him self up to the police because they are all absolutely impotent. Similar like Richard from Delphi, he was jumping around "I was there, I was there.." and police ignored him. But after 5 years they finally said "uuuf .. ok ..let's check him".  Check this one if you wanna know how police is proceeding while encounter suspect. " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OLzntLQS3U ". Must see it.
It's no safety in USA whit all that illegals walking free ,, we don't know nothing about them, and apparently the authorities and the government don't give a fk about if we the citizens that pay taxes are safe or not.. it's very disappointed
God bless you all. This situation is so difficult for everyone!
Hmm the subjects probably live in the home
Alot of people believe in the fantasy world in their own minds, that they know what law enforcement should be doing and the right way to do it. LOL. They really do. They actually think they know how this murder investigation should be done and that Moscow police, Idaho state police and FBI are doing it wrong. These judgemental fools commenting like this DONT HAVE A CLUE about what is going on in this investigation or how investigations are even done. There is something we have here called LAWS and PROCEDURES. The "know it alls" would totally SCREW this investigation completely.
Based on what he said about having a lot of info and keeping it safe I’m starting to think they know who did it but they need to find a link or probable cause so they don’t lawyer up or get spooked- like he said, “we want a conviction”, - this crime may have even been setup this way to be as frustrating as possible for law enforcement and detectives, by someone who is basically saying they could do this and there’s nothing you can do about it bc they covered there tracks and all the bases so well
BLAH BLAH BLAH... Ya'll keep doing these CYA press conferences that ONLY display INCOMPETANCE! Continuing to explain the basic crime scene processing and investigation... STFU and do your jobs... not talk about how one does your job... This is utter BS
Were the girls lesbians? They were in bed together. Sounds like y’all need to look at the other les……girls……in that house that night. Pretty freaking odd how they “heard nothing”, “saw nothing”, “know nothing”, and waited HOURS after discovering the bodies to contact law enforcement. Instead they call “friends” to come clean up the scene?? Hmmmm
They don’t have squat and messed up the case/crime scene.
All these Dumb ass cops are doing is letting any budding murderer know that they can kill and not get caught
The 2nd day this local police should have asked for assistance from other agencies with a lot more resources. Dragging feet and playing is safe might have cost them the case!
White folks get killed it’s a national tragedy. To b honest white people have a history of committing Heynis Crimes. IE white serial killers Billy the kid I mean it goes on and on
IMO ..This statement was presented wonderfully by the Moscow police Captain!🙏🙏🙏💔💔💔💔 He did an excellent, informative, statement, which helped me feel so much better about the investigation....!💔💔💔💔 knowing that they are tracking down and interested in every lead and and bit of information possible..!.💔💔💔💔 and how they have everyone working on the case....!🙏🙏🙏💔💔💔💔 May God Bless Him and lead both him and the other investgators into finding the truth and justice for these sweet young children who had such promise in life! 💔💔💔💔 For we know that God sees and knows all things and it would be better for this person and/or persons to just come in and confess as God will not allow them to have a moment of peace in their heart/s and mind/s until they confess!💔💔💔💔🙏🙏🙏  And I pray that the Lord will hold their families and their friends in His Loving Arms and comfort them in this devastating time!💔💔💔💔🙏🙏🙏
My heart and prayers go out to these families I can't imagine the horror your going through and also at the holidays! I pray every night for you and the police to solve this horrific crime!!
Prayers for everyone.  I can't imagine being one of these parents and seeing all the crap on social media about this case.
Here's an update for the public:  We have nothing. We will pretend to have something but will rely on the good old excuse of not wanting to compromise the investigations to not share any info with you. Our investigations will never reach a conclusion until someone steps forward and shares vital information that puts us in a tough position and forces us to solve the case. This is done by design. We want unsolved, painful cases to frustrate, pain, and anger the public. We want people to support future initiatives such as microchipping everyone, accenting 24/7 surveillance, DNA collection, digital ID and CBDC.  Just take a look at the Delphi case and you'll understand how a murderer who came forward and put himself at the crime scene, wearing the same outfit, matching the killer's description, in a town of less than 3000 inhabitants and an investigation run by multiple divisions and LE levels including the FBI ... had managed to walk freely for more than 5 years. Five whole damn years blamed on a "clerical error" or "filing mistake." And the finger-pointing game started. Doug Carter said on multiple occasions that when everything has been done and the investigations had reached a dead end "we will start all over again." He clearly lied to his teeth because had they started all over again they would've discovered that "clerical error."  And "guys, down the hill" was everything the public was told for 5 whole years of incompetence and screw ups of police work. We can't give you more information so as not to compromise the investigations. We won't share more details. Because heavens forbid, had they shared more details the public would've identified the killer 5 years ago. We can't have that, right? Google, Apple, Facebook, the WEF won't like that. It's not good for the communist agenda of 2030 and the Great Reset, is it?!  And here's another simple case of a murderer who was interviewed and cleared by law enforcement. Jack S. who was identified as a person of interest by web sleuths and the public. A person who should be extensively looked into and grilled in interviews was allowed to walk out freely and without submitting a DNA sample. The stalker who was presumably "making sure the girls arrived home safely" on the very same morning they got murdered. Is law enforcement for real!!!
I prey the NRA politicians get their just reward for their being whores for the gun manufactureres
So in other words Moscow is going to turn into a ghost town until someone is suspected
This should have been done weeks ago, public relations officer or the Capt should have been connected with the public to stop the speculation
I really hope they catch whoever did this and give him the death penalty for doing such a ferocious crime
I know people have been upset about the lack of info put out on this case but looking at it from the investigator’s perspective I can completely see why they don’t want to put info out there.   The public is a double edged sword.   On one side, it can be beneficial to have sleuth’s looking into all this.   On the other hand, there’s a lot of unstable people out there who might inject a lot of info etc that can just be a distraction to the investigators.   The public is so used to these days of technology that it seems strange to us that this investigation is being kept so private.
What update? .Police and Investigators FBI haven't produced anything other than saying we have a lot of Tips. Big Deal!...  Not fair to the Parents or the Community on nothing solid or anything  to say on being  updated or keep everyone waiting..
As for local safety, the murderer could very well still be among the populace. I believe Idaho is an open carry state. Not sure if ID is a constitutional carry state. Exorcize your constitutional right and carry a weapon for your safety. Carry illegally concealed if you must but carry a gun. "The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Your life depends on it.
He sounds idiotic
From this moment i will stop watching or believing the media about this case unless it comes from the law enforcements, yes you are right Sir, public keeps speculating without valid sources, i will keep the victims families and law enforcements in my prays, may our Lord bless you all.
But I can get caught doing 5 over the speed limit. Prayers to the families.
KILLERis here watching. POPO Got nothing.
LE sure has to put up with a lot of unnecessary nonsense. Especially ones wanting instant results.
You need to look for who is NOT there …. Who quit their job, quit school, or just moved out of town.  Flyers sent to every business in Pullman & Moscow.  Ads in every local publication.   Put signs at every grocery store.   Whoever did this is smart.  But maybe too smart, and that mean’s predictable.
Walking and sleeping with your loaded guns
Had to look down to read the victims names smdh
What??!
I really, really, really hope this case is solved
You are stupid, INCOMPETENT and airigant!!
With all the criticism going around, I just wanted to say that I believe you guys are working very hard to solve this. Rome was not built in a day and this will take time. It is probably a monumental task to examine all the evidence, interview everyone, and to collect and look into tips from the public. I have faith that in time you will find the person responsible for this horrible crime. Thank you!
I know a little about slow police work and lack of police activity. It's very frustrating for family members of victims.I do believe these cops are doing something.I experienced no police work at all under the" Lundy Administration" in calcasieu parish Louisiana back in 2002.They wouldn't even admit there had been a crime committed till they finally realized they better get off their lazy asses and that people pay taxes for their salaries.A real disappointment Sheriff Beth Lundy was. And the egotistical detectives were asses. Sometimes you have to work on holidays when there's a murder victim to be recovered.I could go on and on.Tunnel vision is also a problem with fat and lazy detectives.
I still believe that they won't find the murderer ... just my opinion..
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird, that two other people were home and heard nothing? I can see how it could have happened to one person without anyone waking up....but four? Surely, someone must've fought back and made a commotion. Add to that,  none of the people trying to wake the girl they thought was passed out noticed multiple stab wounds? Or, at least blood? It's just weird.
What happens if the pos,goes to another country?
Thank you Moscow Police Dept
I think you don’t have “volumes” of information to go through. I think you’re buying time because you have little to nothing. You’re still asking for leads? This update is simply a CYA announcement.
This bloke is really famous, in fact he is on 37 clickbait channels on youtube all making up stories to get money from Adsense.
So, no new leads. A lot of words for no information in your update.
Four people brutally murdered. Definitely a safety issue. How can that not be an elevated risk??
BACK DA BLUE
Here is my “profile” of the type of person who committed these murders… HE is Male, he is angry with pretty women,  or maybe women! But definitely pretty young flirty women. NOT THAT THE VICTIMS ARE TO BLAME HERE. This man has never had a women give him their real phone number. And wouldn’t typically go out on a date with him. He is most likely an “Antifa” like individual who believes that life has been unfair to him… Most likely this MAN felt in some sick ass shitty way that HE was in the right. Hope this helps, it’s just a hobby I have In profiling criminals.
Frustrating slow progress, but justice will prevail. No matter what happens our sovereign God sees all and DOES take care of business. Nobody hurts others with impunity.
Calling all angels to help solve this case.
There are traffic cámaras and Almost everybody has a ring cámara,it is nearly impossible for anybody to hide!! Plus the cameras in every store church buildings like come on
I wonder why the 2 other girls in the house are described as 'surviving?'  Not to say they were not harmed or seen. I just find it an interesting description.
Hey dummy they all made it home! Get new police 👮‍♀️ this guy is clueless
That guy knows were the donut shop is. That's it.
Maybe the 2 that lived were somehow involved maybe they weren't. Maybe they lived due to luck, maybe involved.....
It’s still someone they rebuffed earlier!
Sounds like idiots are sabotaging this investigation like they did Delphi. Sounds like these investigators didn't learn from Delphi. Keep it local damn it.
Anyone else sick of Johnathon Lee Riches accusing everyone and making up stuff!
I can’t believe no leads yet. I also can’t believe the bodies were buried so fast I don’t believe bodies were thoroughly examined
in other words...there is no update
⚠️⚠️⚠️IMPORTANT NOTE 🔴 KILLER was hiding already waiting for those kids.    🔴🔴The most brutally stabbed was the LAST Victim.
Just wait until the Father of one of the girls, starts a reward!!!!  Then the flood gates will open.  it is awful that this will impact the investigation with crazies calling in anything for the money.  A reward, this early is going to hamper the investigation, rather than help.  As the Police Officer said, they have thousands of tips to wade through. Rewards often coming into force when the tips have dried up.  Often later when whoever is frightened to contact the police, are tempted to change their mind!!!  At this precise time, anyone who has relevant info, might be too frightened to come forward, until the heat dies down.
On behalf of what is left of humanity on social media, thank you for your efforts, keep up the good work, we know you will solve this and get a conviction in due time.
to me an update is a lead. this case is all over news social media and youtubers 24/7 constantly talking about it even though no leads to follow up to update.
That car had to get gas at some point
Its frustrating for families and the public to have maybe another delphi or gabby p on their hands. Too many violent crimes get swept under the rug. How many times do the public call the pilice and nothing gets down because le dont got money time or are bias or corrupt. Public wants to be safe. LE fails to make or keep the pubkic safe in some areas around the country.
I just watched a Video.  One of the Girls had a Room Mate that committed suicide.  And the Comments was terrible toward the Students Killed. Look into that.  They was blaming one.  Could be one close to the girl that committed suicide
Have they talked to the four guys seen running from the house??
Prayers to all the surviving family members of each victim. Hoping for answers soon. 🙏🙏
Was one of these girls hooking up with a police officer? Was that her stalker? Where I am from the police sexually harrase girls 21yrs old and younger all the time. It's possible the killer is a cop.
What where the cops doing in the area before they turned on the body cam???
Thank you sir for all you're doing.
Maybe they should look into stolen car reports to see if there are any like the one they are looking for. Not just locally. There was one serial killer named Danny Rolling(?) who spent years traveling around and going into random houses and butchering people. I believe he was finally caught after a young girl survived having her throat slashed. She pretended to be dead until he left. So I think it could be a serial killer. Many of them have killed with brutal rage too.
Stupid police. They already know who did it. Yet they don't allow peace in the public.
One guy at the food truck in the Golden long sleeve shirt was rebuffed it looked like he went in for a hug and was totally ignored. . Also a animal fur was hanging in the window with the fur toward the outside.  Was it a calling card. Wouldn't the fur be so you could see it in the house.
Drink your water and please get rest too. All of you are doing an outstanding job.  I cannot imagine the stress and sadness. You | team working, are doing amazing. Thank You!
So what about the glove that sat undiscovered outside the house for a month until a retired detective noticed it? What about the Kid that posted what appears to be detailed accounts of he and his fellow students doing the crime on 4chan? Could we be dealing with a "scream" scenario with multiple student perps acting together in a revenge killing for perceived slights from the victims? Who are the mysterious four sihouettes seen in the bodycam video running in the background around the time of the murders? White hoodie guy has more red flags than a Chinese new year celebration. I suspect this is more complex than anyone has guessed. I'm starting to believe a conspiracy among four students to commit a murder on the victims in the same scenario as the movie "Scream". Police should consider this possibility especially with the 4chan posts and the connections between several students that are materializing. This may not be a lone perp.
My heart goes out to the first responders who had to witness the crime scene and collect evidence, I can not imagine how hard and disturbing that line of work must be, it definitely takes a strong person.   Thank you for what all Law Enforcement officers and agents are doing to solve this crime.
EXCELLENT TRANSPARENCY SIR!
I came home to find my housemate being held at knifepoint by a stalker dude who followed her home from a pub in London. My other two housemates froze and when I asked them to go get help, they refused and then they were not capable of helping me take down the guy. We were very lucky that two of our male housemates then came home and had two male friends with them, so they immediately ran into the room, tackled the guy and beat the shit out of him, he ran down the road. He's still out there. This happened in London in 1995. Another friend  on Long Island was stalked by a guy who saw her dancing at a bar and he got into her cabin (he was so quiet she had no idea he was inside her place!!) and filmed her in her shower without her knowing and then left a video tape of it! She was worried no one would believe her. Then he started leaving messages on her phone machine and then luckily the local police believed her and found out he was calling her from a payphone down the road and arrested him. There are some real cretins out there. He's probably out of jail now.
Well said🍻✌🏽
This is why it's taking so long, a vast number of tips, film and probably the same with phone,  interview information and forensic evidence.  This is a huge puzzle and just takes tons of time from many individuals and that's not mentioning the long hours and sleepless nights of those who have to sift through all this tragic information.
Moscow police are useless, 1 month and still no leads absolute joke
Prayers to the families and friends of the victims.    Thank you for all involved in trying to solve this case.
I wonder if he might do a better job if he had his ass kicked
Wow always thought  that was one of safest state .smh triple 187
Prayers from Kuwait.🙏🙏🙏 I think that young people should also be very careful about who has been given access codes to their doors as well.
the fuzz gots nuffin
Social media is good In one way but shite in another with the bull shit people come out with
Anyone living there is not safe.  That should be stressed more strenuously.  This evil murderer could be long gone but no one knows.  I wouldn't leave my house without protection. And I sure would not let my kids go to school there right now.
Whoever committed these horrific murders better sleep with one eye open, as the police are sure to come for you, it's only a matter of time. So Mr. Murderer, whoever you may be,  sleep easy while you can, as they are coming, and I for one can't wait for the day when they catch your sorry arse
In other words, we don't know shit.
if only the police spend this much resources when the victims were black
I hope you find under their nails people who had killed them this is the most saddest thing I can see sorry
Are you sure that the cargo/goods taken away from the crime scene immediately did not obstruct any clues/effidence to cause of murder and the move was by people possibly part of the murders 😎?
I hate to break it to you officer but all those bad apples make people not want to talk to you. If I was there and saw something, I wouldn’t talk to you because you people put people in prison who are innocent for decades.
The Police Officer that spoke during this segment, Captain Lanier,did a good job of speaking about the situation. He seemed knowledgeable,and genuine.
Perhaps the Moscow police should get assistance from the Boulder Police Department.  We all know what a fine job those guys did on the JonBenet Ramsey murder investigation.
Also some ppl hav compared:Kaylee's personality with allegedly:AH*Kaylee bless her soul is  someone that's bright n motivated♡*
Just say we have nothing . Tune in next week when we have still nothing .
These kids r not dumb,they've gotten so far in their education n no this case is alive/well*lt's not gonna b swept under the rug n be forgotten!!!
I pray to God that you find the perpetrator of these murders and present him or her to God for judgment... I also pray for peace for the family I pray the family will get some comfort with one another and in our Lord Jesus Christ two rose from the grave after being crucified by Rome.
Thank you for your dedicated efforts in investing this crime. I hope that the killer gets caught. I also hope that we start to crack down on internet sleuths and media programs that capitalize off these situations. I am speaking specifically about that retired random male who just happened to be in Moscow over Thanksgiving and who found a glove, as well as that Banfield lady who can't shut up.
Doubt this was some drug-related hse,if it were so(it would be)the safest pl(locks,sensors)etc if allegedly staff's stashed there!!!Nope
I don't think people realize just how frequently cops totally botch murder investigations.... looks like this will be no different - if they don't get a DNA match, they'll end up pinning it on some poor vagrant.
Stabbing is very personal way to kill. It takes skill and strength. This has the feel of a serial murderer or spree murderer. 🤔 It would follow that the victims might have known the killer. At least he had to be someone they were aware of since the murderer took on 4 people and was successful. He didnt just drive around and pick a spot. I guarantee this wasn't his first. Too calculated, too precise. A first time killer doesn't take on 4 people. He was calm, methodical and older...im thinking 30's to 50's. I am also thinking look at college campus employees for some reason. It's just a feeling. Could be a cop. Guy is skilled.
Make the tip line easy to remember!
Thanks to law enforcement, FBI for trying to catch the criminal or criminals to get justice for the four students.
POV : Announcement 🗣 every student and everyone in moscow around that area of the murder there phone is tapped. Have access to all there phone information there call log pictures everything.
I think there is a sick self -proclaimed ‘frat’ of young guys guided by one alpha male. I think they met or connected via video games and then got led into hunting animals like wolves together. They worked together to watch out for and restrain while this one ring leader did the butchering. It’s inconceivable that these psychopaths can find one another, but we are in a new world here. I pray for swift and focused retribution. Forget about getting some slam dunk, someone WILL break among this sick little ‘wolfpack’!
why was hoodie guy cleared? if you have video of him somewhere else at the times in question, show us!
Pathetic moron. What he's really thinking is why this had to happen to him two years before retirement.
All those tips times 4 people.  That takes TIME.  keep up the good work.
Here is an update: we have no update
so nothing?  they got nothing.....
This guy basically has no progress and nothing to say. He is a good hearted soul but not the right soul to crack this open.
God bless everyone working so diligently to solve these crimes.
The young man who drove 5 hours to his parents, do you know what kind of car he drove there to the cabin. Seems I read he left just as the bodies were discovered...just thought.......what kind of car he drives ?
GREAT ADVICE KEEPIN THE FAITH THANKS FOR ALL U HAVE DONE 👍
Pigs are negro 🐖 Anyone that doesn't honor our first amendment right of absolute freedom of speech has the trait of a coward, not bravery, which would be the most police, Congress, and most Americans
Why not pray to a God who doesn't let this stuff happen?
And this guy pretty much said to ALWAYS stay vigilant. So you’re literally saying live in fear…this case gonna go cold 😂
Dear Captain Lanier, I appreciate all that you and everyone involved in working on this case have and are doing and will do. In spite of any criticism you all are doing everything possible to solve this case and bring justice for the victims, their families, and everyone affected by this horrible murderer. God bless you all.
My take is that they have a person of interest but they need unequivocal evidence to get a conviction.  This is why they haven't offered a reward.
So nothing
Hoodie guy (sociopath) did it!!!! cops know it already but they are protecting him for some reason!!!!! cause he disappeared or took off from Moscow.
Weird
Thank you for your vigilance and for the hard work you all do in keeping your community safe!
Monday Update: Nothing new. 🤔
Is there a reason he mentioned he has investigators in Moscow, Salt Lake City and Virginia? That seems like a very spread out area with nothing in between.
Thank you for your service. I have faith you guys will catch these cowards
Locking our doors, having security cameras, having ring doorbells, having light outside out homes, having self protection at home.
🤣 what even is the point of this. Telling people your committed isnt going to bring the stress level down, or the fear level, or comfort the damn parents. They should just stop doing these. until they have something of value to deliver.....
Please people talk and assist police someone somewhere knows something ,if you harbour this killer one day he will murder you and you going to live your life worshipping him since you know what he's capable of
This is useless 😶🥱😒
Looking for lead that might break it open for them???! They DONT have a suspect!! They don’t have anything concrete that points a finger at any one person! Hope this changes soon❤
Something stinks.
If they had give that case over to the FBI from day one policing is good for the general public but a murder like that is for highly trance agent
Do your best. Grieving parties need your commitment to solve this. I personally believe you will.
It’s tough to stick with “official” information, because YOU DONT SHARE ANY!!!
URGENT MESSAGE!!! PLEASE PASS ON!!!!! FOR ANYONE WHO HAS NOT RECONCILED TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST THEY WILL SPEND ETERNITY TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF YEARS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE. THE BIBLE SAYS BEFORE THAT DAY THERE WILL BE A GREAT FALLING AWAY FIRST. DO NOT FALL INTO FALSE DOCTRINE. READ THE BIBLE THE SOURCE! SEEK THE LORD WHILE HE MAY BE FOUND CALL ON HIM WHILE HE IS NEAR LET THE WICKED FORSAKE THEIR THOUGHTS AND THE UNRIGHTEOUS FORSAKE THEIR WAY LET THEM TURN TO HIM AND HE WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON THEM FOR HE WILL ABUNDANTLY PARDON! REPENT THE DAY OF THE LORD DRAWS NEAR! IT IS NOT TIME FOR FIGHTING OR STRIFE IT IS TIME TO SNATCH SOULS FROM THE FIRE. THEIR WILL BE WHALING AND KNASHING OF TEETH WHERE THE FIRE IS NEVER QUENCHED AND THE WORM NEVER DIES. DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST! PASS THIS MESSAGE ON! PRAY FOR REVIVAL AND SALVATION OF SOULS IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST!
So nothing new. Lol. This isn't csi or law order cases don't get solved in 40 minutes could take months years some never get solved.  Period that's it
I can only imagine what kind of tips people are calling in. At this point in the investigation, I doubt there is much solid information left. .Seeing so many ridiculous theories online, I would hope they are not submitting a lot of nonsense to the tip line. People are complaining that the case is getting cold etc, but if people wouldn't waste the investigators time with BS, they could spend time on legitimate info, not some bored housewive's imagination acting like they are one of Charlie's Angels. Go to the library and read some paperback thrillers instead of screwing with other people's lives
Thanks for your post GOD BLESS
Sounds like they don’t have anyone. Simply because anything will break it open and always be vigilant which is not there’s a psychopath that slaughtered 4 college kids out there just hey you should always be vigilant and always walk in pairs. It’s the new normal.
I have watched so many crimes shows sometime it takes a week month years to aresset someone I no the parents are so over welmed and devasted how ever police should talk to the parents and tell the parents not to talk to the public
Have any of you guys seen the video of Jack Showalter out by the food truck that clearly shows the outline of a fixed blade hunting knife under his hoodie as though it was strapped to his  chest? Anyone? Was this image falsified or was it for real?  Come on,  somebody besides me had to have seen this!!!
This so-called latest update was the proverbial nothing 🍔 burger; just like all the previous ones. Sadly, mostly aggravating the public rather than encouraging them. o_0
Really you don't say well crap we all know that the two still alive are your suspects  why are they still alive 🤔
You can’t tell they law doesn’t want this suspect as much as the family . Their not heartless their working their ass off .
I think we all should be worried. This lunatic is loose in our country!!!
Sounds like the cops are making excuses for their incompetence . Oh yes , you sure can depend on the news media as an informed source of information .    12/22
So nothing new
Xaoh!!!!!
Prayers from Canada to all the families. May your faith help you through this incredible loss especially at the holiday season 😢
Don't count on the fbi! I mean they have a laptop with a lot of incriminating and obvious evidence and still can't get their act together! 🤔 oops. Totally forgot! the crimininal is a liberal and related to a liberal politician! Get out of jail free card!
His competence is evident
The  homicide is connected to Hannah Cleere, who was supposedly an ex-roommate and shared her dorm room with one of the Idaho victims. They bullied and harassed Cleere, who eventually took her own life on February 24, 2022. Hannah Cleere took her life in February. She shared a dorm with one of the victims and got bullied. Her birthday: November 15." With the post, the user has even shared two images. One of the image is suposedly of Hannah Cleere, which is captioned, "Hannah was born on November 15, 2000, and passed away on February 24, 2022 at the age of 21. I knew Hannah and her brother vowed revenge for his sister.. I thought I would share this
The father of Kaylee needs to let them do their job and be patient. 4 murders takes time. I believe this case will be solved very soon. Our technology and science today is amazing.
Yeah Jonathan lee riches channel needs to be shut down !!! He’s spreading terrible news and accusations on innocent people and literally everyone is a suspect to him even a grieving parent
The update was the tip line phone number ha!
.. this is just getting ridiculous... he has The Killers DNA ...okay it doesn't match anyone in the database...So  start pulling in people and ask them to give  you their DNA!!!!!!!! OMG they should have no problem with that and if they do well then they really have a problem ...what are you people waiting for?
This idiot goes about business but the DA sucks they probably want a police state for these kids running there life .
I knew there was no update! So what's the update chief?????
Why can't you find a car?
This stuff is suspicious you can't kill that many people and leave no  evidence. Is it a campus police officer?
First thing police said was targeted, isolated on day one. No threat to the public. Mayor called it a crime of passion.   Then the nurse lawyer coroner declared it a homicide. A coroner that defends killers, in court. Everyone has been chasing their tails since.
Thank you for all your hard work.
They’re in so far over their heads.
This guy is a very calming public information officer. I can see how frantic people may not appreciate that, but I do.
They must have numerous photos or clips of that white car in that area during the time of murders. That is the only way they are going to make a statement like that. Most likely someone picked up that car on a doorbell camera etc.
If you read between the lines, it seems he is saying they have a person of interest, a suspect, but don't want to simply make an arrest, but want enough evidence for a conviction.  I think the killer must be sweating his own blood right now, scared to death. Yah, somebody must have come forward with the right info to make an arrest... they are just waiting for the frosting on the cake.  He should confess, maybe save himself the death penalty.
Did I miss the 'update'? there was no update here.
This killer is a pro! He is a sophisticated and advanced killer. Girls.....they are a dime a dozen. Get arms training and legally carry. Get self defense training!!!
So, no progress, then.
The real question is was the code changed after the lock was replaced? If it was then there should of been a limited amount of people who knew the new code.
Well said, people are running around pointing fingers and hindering the case.  Give the police concrete tips to solve this murder case asap.  Everyone appears to be playing the police.  Let them do their work without distractions.  Believe me from a legal background, the police and FBI want this resolved.
This is so sad my prayers to all the families. They need to catch this evil person or persons who did this horrible act 🙏
Sooo useless, same speech over and over again, offer a big reward to make people come forward and talk
In other words nothing new
I’m still betting on JJS. They’re just waiting on dna. There’s just too many red flags with him
IOW COPS got nothing!
They already started since 2020 when covid-19 started this world.
Praying for our Latah County, Idaho Law Enforcement, Moscow Police Department, FBI for spiritual guidance to aide in the capturing of this killer.
4:53 IT is frustrating and confusing stop targeting names!
To summarize, you want to talk to the occupants of a white car and you're sifting through all the tips people have phoned in. Got it. Now, what was the update?
I honestly think this will go as unsolved.... there have been some things to take away from this one is door code security.  If it was true where this has been a place for parties and the code was not changed is something to learn... there may be more coming in the months ahead hopefully closure but I have a feeling that may never happen
they have no idea what they are doing......why don't you talk to Psychic Reverend Donna Seraphina she has so much info and was right on with so many other investigations .. she actually said the FBI needs to take over
Such a respectful professional
How was there no surveillance captured?  I am puzzled as to why this is still an active and open case.  This is scary- this town is full of kids!!!  Praying for a break asap.  Someone knows something!  😢
I see why the Captain is saying it, he means well giving good advice but the truth is, nobody should have to live life where they have to walk from A to B with another person, or phone a friend or family member when you get in to let them know, "Hey mom, I'm home and didn't get murdered tonight."  That would be a horrible society to live in and is utterly senseless, tragic and evil as these acts are, if you structure you way of living around this killer or Killers....He/They have won.
I'm really starting to think it was a completely random person that did this crime. Just my opinion.
I’m sure the police are so frustrated with the public!! I think they know more than they’re saying, and are prioritizing the integrity of the case over informing the public of their every move. They have far too many brilliant minds on this to have nothing. Dna takes a while, processing a scene takes a while, and somehow they’ve assessed that the college community isn’t in immediate danger. Having the FBI & state PD experience & resources alongside the heart of a small police department really is the best possible combination to get this solved AND prosecuted. Talking theories is one thing, but targeting individuals or spreading false info isn’t worth it!!
It would be great if the fbi would take a break from investigating parents of school children and Trump supporters, maybe they could figure it out. Then again it must be challenging to figure out a crime that you aren’t involved in smfh.
I'm looking at the car. Are you sure it's a Hyundai? Maybe it's a Toyota or a Nissan or maybe a Honda? Plus when did Kaylee actually get her range rover? I was on Google maps looking at skinny Santa's  house and there was an update on Oct 22 and there are similar white cars and if you look to the apartments on the right of his house(left if you're looking at it.) and zoom in, there's a similar range rover parked in the back parking lot. Plus I remember when I was talking to him he said he had some charges in Washington for buying alcohol for some minors. Most likely skagit county. 13>00. Peace and Ahev
The wild speculation that goes on is over the top.  People convinced who the killer is despite having almost no facts to go on is really a bit crazy.  There are many comments by people who are convinced this person or that person is guilty and saying that a mistake was made by clearing them, when in fact they really don't have any information.  I doubt the police are going to put out simple details as to why some people were cleared, it isn't their job to do that.  Their job is to find who did it and  make sure the person can be convicted.  I suppose some people were cleared quickly simply because the police had hard evidence as to where they were when the crimes were committed (video evidence, witnesses,,,,) but they have no reason to go through all those details with the public.  Maybe we should all just stick to the showing some sympathy and support for the families and leave it at that.
Prayers from Baltimore Maryland 🙏 ❤️
I don’t believe him. Tough job but they don’t know anything. They’re looking for a white car? That’s all they have? This case is going cold cold
thank u for ur all hard methodical work👍🙏
UPDATE:means NOTHinG NeW!wake up People...white car ?baloney..more cliche than that?you..bet..black car!bingo.
Hang in there Moscow PD! We appreciate you. I know you're an outstanding group of LEO and I'm proud to be an Idahoan and Moscow native. You've all got this and we've got your backs and you've got our support and love.
One pair of hands working does more than a million clasped in prayer.
I commend all of the people involved with this investigation. I believe in all of the information brought forth with all of this.
Either they’re not telling him anything, or it seems they have nothing. I can’t believe it could be the latter
https://youtu.be/LnIRB0-po8s
I think that car has something connected to their suspect or suspects, thats why they are desperately looking for it.
The update is “there is no update”
We support the Moscow police, Idaho Bureau of Investigation, and FBI teams who are working so hard, taking time away from their own families, to apprehend the suspect(s). Thank you, most sincerely. And of course, deep condolences to the families and friends.
They will find the killer or killers
Sending strength and love to all those directly investigating this horrible crime.  They must be exhausted and emotionally fragile so please give them some love and respect.  They are working so hard 🤗🥲🦋
"Stay vigilant at all times."  Yes, that's what it's like living in the U.S. these days.
I knew you were "good to go" Captain.  You seem to have a tough one on your plate, Captain. May God's thoughts and wisdom lead you through capture and prosecution.
The fact that the owner of the white car in question isn’t coming forward to clear their own name seems strange.
The true crime community is causing untold harm to these investigations. The community has become toxic and saturated with fools. Moscow police Dept are clearly hopeless. Let’s hope Idaho state PD and the FBI can solve this. The perp or perps will kill again .
Everyone is sick of seeing this old 🐐 goat.
Shut Up
So in other words you have nothing.😂😂😂😂
To all Idaho LE : Ignore all haters!  Good hunting!
Continued prayers for the families and friends of these precious young adults. Prayers to all LEO and teams working so hard on this case. I can’t imagine how tough if it is for all involved.   May these four beautiful souls get the justice they so much deserve.
Sir, you made the right choice calling in the State Police, bringing in the FBI, and additional support for crime scence evidence.  You are a small department and properly utilized the resources around you.  It was not 1 murder but 4.  I am sure this is agonizing for the parents and cannot be easy.  Great idea, great thinking for this update.  My thoughts and prayers are with you, your team, other LE there supporting you, to the family and friends of the victims, and residents of Moscow, Idaho.
Come up with an easier email address alias for the email tip line... Are you kidding me?
Ethan Chapin was mentioned in reports as a Freshman.  Yet, he was a freshman in August of 2021.  Umm,  shouldn’t he be a sophomore? This could be important?
I don’t understand why people keep calling the police for no reason, and just wasting their time. Also, the victim’s family has the right to justice, but it’s better to have the perpetrator or perpetrators, and not just any random person, just to keep public quiet. You can obviously see how this investigation it’s struggling the investigators and the police enforcement. Please don’t give the police, false leads, just to get your 5 minutes of fame 🙄
Am I the only person willing to start a "theory" that our open internet allows decades of perfected hypnosis techniques by enemy states to hypnotize us citizens into being a remote control dissident?🤷‍♂️ That being said. I'm effing triggered! I'm starting a petition to change the name of Moscow to Mike town
Dog the Bounty Hunter can help you 😂
Prayers
Send the dogs to track this killer now 😂 tell me it is a manhunt without telling me it is a manhunt
You said the same shit last time. Sorry for my language
Sounds  GREAT TO try an be safe but saying be vigilant when the Joe Biden administration has the border wide open an All kinds of criminals coming across the border infact just coming across the border is illegal.  To all be safe an realize COPS HAVE IT HARD AN WILL BE HARDER as  this illegal acts from people coming across the border will allow people to commit more crime, IT WILL COME
This was stupid.
Lame
He just admitted they know who did it by saying, "we have a lot of information but want more than an arrest  -- we want a conviction." They need just one or two more pieces of evidence.
those meddling kids always solve the case. scooby doo. its always the janitor or groundskeeper lol or the disgruntle neighbor
This is why I have cams in and outside my house and I encourage my neighbors to do the same.  So basically there is no new update.  I'll sum it all up in a few words for those looking for a real update, "We are analyzing all tips that come in and don't want to release any important details that might compromise the investigation."  What a waste of time.  thumbs down and next.
In other words, the cops have nothing to go on...
what a horrible world he created...
One of them pissed someone off and that’s it….case solved
Strange even stranger if a fellow student on campus did this horrific murders. Puzzling deep down someone nos something on campus and not talking I bet. You think house they were killed had cameras in this day and age also surrounding places around them . To kill them this horrific secrets were taken with them to there graves if they new or pissed some psycho off . Hope justice for these kids .Death penalty if Idaho has one
This isn't the end of it guys. They will catch the killer only after he kills again. Took years and dozens of nuders to catch the btk killer. They have t any idea who did this and they won't untill he kills again
By the fact they’re dead they didn’t do enough to live. Be willing to kill and to die at any given moment is the only answer. I didn’t make 75 years by trusting any part of society. At some point they were sheep. Slaughtered with no remorse. I know at all times where every steak knife or weapon is located in my house behind security doors that are locked. Talk about killing with no remorse, give me the slightest legal right to defend myself. Can you live after looking right into the eyes of a man looking back at you in horror knowing he’s going to die right then and now. I can and do. Went for a pizza afterwards. The only thing different from a citizen protecting themselves legally and the sick coward who sneaks up on the innocent is the law. Both are emotional monsters. Be an emotional monster, live.
Who got Killed what was the Motive? Was it Justifiable Homicide? By leaving information out you leave the world in suspense, unacceptable.
The heinous act of violence against soul's full of life & family's lives forever changed and never to return to what was. My blessing's to the families enduring this time and know we're all in supporting you from near and far, Our All Father's love to you and may this be solved soon.
Prayers out. Been waiting, will be grateful when it all comes to a head!!
Some one close enough to murders to misdirect
I don't care what anyone says I think this department has done an incredible job! Nothing they have done or said or not said has been alarming to me. I'm a huge true crime sleuth I've seen every dateline 2020 48 hours American justice, I know my states laws very well personally.. this is a massive investigation.. even for a department that deals with homicides regularly.. for a small department that doesn't deal with this regularly they immediately called for assistance they have done everything right)!! I applaud them. My heart is with the family I understand their grieving and frustrating but I know this department will not let them down.
It was online people that MADE you look at that body cam footage. There is also a screa on it you can clearly Hear so why clear the roommates living. If we can hear it on body cam they had to. There was also a person in all black looming at the girls behind Hoodie guy that stood against a wall. Never showed their face....you look at that
Save your prayers, they’re worthless.
So they know when the murders occured? To state that the car was in the area when the murders occured! They have no clues so just keep guessing huh?
Slow and steady wins the race. No stone unturned.
all these prayers, god was watching like it was a pay per view event and let the killer escape.
Here is what you need to do get 12 of the best I don't mean like top of the class of graduation best but I mean straight old school top shelf hand pick 12 of the top dogs and get them together in one room and see how fast they figure it out.. these 4 need justice ⚖️ they were not suppose to leave this earth yet. Who ever made that premature decision needs to pay.
In an unrelated story, Californians flee from California due to...
BIDEN and his illegal aliens 👹
It’s starting to look everyday this has the potential of becoming a cold case.
I feel sorry for the parents. This PD is woefully unprepared and experienced to solve this.
Tread Big Captain Lanier. Crimes are not solved to make News for Media. Stay focused & do not Rush with case.
Well I want to ask you this, why did you tell the residents in Moscow there was NO NEED to be worried. You GAVE the murder a PASS to get away. So you mislead your residents IMMEDIATELY why .
It sounds to me that police do not have a magoo on who murdered these young individuals.
Maybe if they quit demanding the police give an update every hour they would have more time to solve case.
Why why why do a press conference to say nothing yet again?!?
Suprised nothing new. I feel it's someone who knew them who possibly had been at their home previously maybe a party or something. Possible student. I don't see this as just a random act by a stranger at all. My heart and prayers go out the the families and all working to solve this.
If it were my kids I’d hire an independent investigator. Cops are hiding the perpetrator.
That is not an update!!! Once again he said the same crap.
😪🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🗽
I’m certain the police already interviewed the killer came in contact with him already
i appreciate you, sir. wishing for justice for the moscow family!!
Update?  I didn’t hear anything new.  Bla bla bla!
If this was in NY we'd have the killer long time ago
These cops are bad at their jobs
I think he is doing amazing,  he has daughters and will not let this go cold, he is setting up this case for a with. Put a doubt prosecutions
God bless you chief😊😊😊
Hope you not wasting time doting eyes and crossing Ts you have a killer on the loose 🤦‍♀️
Perhaps video footage of activity/encounters inside/outside the said night club. That may have already been covered; just a thought.
5:00 lol, a lot of information that gives them no suspects... hehe... 🤡🤡🐷🐷
These guys have no idea what the F they're doing. They should have handed the entire investigation over to more experienced and competent hands from the start.
Arm yourself America! Don't be a another statistical victim! Defend your lives!
Imagine if the local authorities and the FBI investigated the rampant Democrat Voter Fraud going  on in our country with this much focus, public updates, and resources.
God Bless All of the Family and Friends of each and every person who was taken and prayers for Law Enforcement in their endeavors to find Justice for all. 🙏🕉🌺🌹🌠🌹🌺🕉🙏
In other words, still nothing...afraid they're long gone by now..another cold case file in the making.
we're still hoping for a stroke of luck that will help us solve this - otherwise, we are literally clueless  the case is getting as cold as the weather
Good Luck When Lauren Spierer went missing we spent a lot of time looking the white vehicle too. We never found it.
FBI still to busy arresting Jan 6th protestors.  Lol. FBI is nothing but a political tool for the Biden regime.
Would it not be prudent to look at the list of students at  tended school and then start looking at students who didn't come back for break. Then cross reference it with who has a white Hyundai in the student register for parking
They should just start calling this guy Jack the Ripper. . . He’s never getting caught.
Makes a person wonder what the heck was the motive!?! This is just crazy!! 🙏 For the victims and their family's!!
I feel sorry for this guy. He should have been the dog catcher. This old boy is ready to break. It may kill him. I'll bet he hasn't slept 15 hours total in 4 weeks. If you can't stand the heat get the hell out of the kitchen
They need to find that car. The fact that noone has came forward yet and said it was their car is a huge red flag. It seemingly has to be the suspects vehicle at this point. No way that whoever owns that car doesn't know they're looking for it by now.
They are getting closer to tell us it was one of them! A cop...
2:54 just be hyper vigilant forever. It only makes sense and is much easier. Remember everyone's the enemy.
I'm very sure all the law enforcement officers involved in this case, will definitely catch who are the suspects or the suspect. Real true honest trained officers, detectives, etc., all those Women and Men will do their jobs!
Scary thought that the killer is still running free! RIP to these college kids!! 🙏
The police that stop those kids on campus you can see there’s a bright light and you can see somebody running from like you can see somebody running through that bright light that’s one and two is it that Hyundai was found at a dealership so just some little dealership you have to look on YouTube one of the YouTube channels I’ll have to look it up and find it for you
God bless you Captain Roger Lineer. I know your department is doing everything in it's power to solve this heinous crime
Rumors have it, that it was orchestrated by the bottom two roommates. Or at least Dylan Mortenson.  Pictures of her Boyfriend surfaced that was geotagged near that house at 3:30 wearing a ski mask with blood clearly on his hoodie. He looks like a super scumbag too. Id bet my bottom dollar on that lead. They also immediately took down photos of them together the day after which is odd.
All that to resume, “we are working hard but we have no clue”.
I read in a news article that the father of one of the victims called the police "cowards" because they would not release the gruesome details of her wounds. To be blunt: the public doesn't need to know the salacious details of the types of wound each victim died by. It's currently not necessary to describe those and I'm sure doing so would only cause some family members more emotional trauma. The cops are putting their efforts into solving things and telling them to try harder is not going to help anybody.
That area has one of the highest concentrations of extreme survivalists in the country. The way one person could silently and effeciently stab 4 sleeping people to death in a house of 6 just screams survivalist to me. Someone who practiced and fantasized doing a stealth knife kill.   Every instinct in me tells me the killer was NOT close to them but a much older man nearby who watched them and saw an opportunity to live out his sick fantasy and to test his skills.
I would think that if those people knew you were looking for them and why you were looking for them they would have come forward if they had seen any plea’s to come forward or if other people had seen the news about them coming forward and told them they might have information it’s been a few day’s since the first time anything was said either they don’t want to or they are that person‼️‼️
Moscow Police Department you got this!!!! God bless you all!!!
As someone who has worked in the legal field in the courtroom, everyone needs to understand that LE has to hold some cards close to their chest and not divulge everything they know to protect the investigation.  They have to have their evidence airtight to make the conviction STICK.  Otherwise, they could arrest someone they feel strongly did it but because of tainted evidence or a technicality, defense counsel could get the case thrown out and the killer(s) walk.  How is that going to help anybody get closure or justice?  It won't.  It's a fine line to walk, but I'm sure w/all this extra help from the FBI and others, they will eventually solve this case.  My cousin was murdered, and it took my aunt & uncle 10 years to bring the perp to justice due to constant problems in the case.
So they still don't have a break on the case. First they say there's no danger to the community but now saying walk with a group and tell others that you're home safe. What a shit show. Unfortunately this case will go cold.
I know they are working hard. However, due to his comments they don't seem to have anything concrete or suspect. It's Sad
In other words we are clueless
🙏🙏🏼 🙏🙏🏼       No words. . .
Why tell us to walk on lighted paths when nobody was killed on an unlit path? Because they don't want to say "Be careful not to die in your house while sleeping."
Step it up.....
In the food truck video is a guy in all back hoodie and pants. He stays to the back leaning on a glass window.Suspicious!! He also wears white tennis shoes with a Nike brand possibly. He is every bit 6 ft tall and looks well toned . He needs  to be looked at
The murderer should just turn himself/herself in…it’s just a matter of time before the perp is identified.
It's always been a good idea to keep the public on a Need to know Basis. Most human beings don't know how to process and distribute information.
pls change the name of the city
No new news
Speaking of vigilant tell your cops to stay vigilant themselves,  too busy busting college kids for drinking while a quadruple murder is happening across the street from them.
They’ve got very little clues or leads. 4 dead and a lot of people are shrugging 🤷‍♀️ of any knowledge about them or what they can recall.  But, their silence has to be respected because they don’t want to say anything to jeopardize a possible solid lead. I am so sorry for the families and friends of these 4 young people.   Godspeed to justice.
Wow 😳 all people at risk madman on the loose 😥🙏🤔😷☹️🧐
This is why the 2 amendment matters...POLICE CANT SOLVE CRIMES ALREADY COMMITTED LET ALONE STOP THEM.
We have enough crime and instability, why do they have to fake these events?
Anybody that could have been picking up or dropping off in a white vehicle is not apt to come forward.
Thank you for your hard work. It is much appreciated. Hopefully you can catch a break soon and recover from this tragedy. Stay strong Moscow❤️
They got nothin. They need to get lucky. Let’s hope so.
LETS BAN WHITE CARS
Why isnt this called a MASS HOMICIDE
There is no way I’d feel safe around there when a “scream” type killer is on the loose. 🙅‍♀️
I remember in the Stephen King novel (The Dead Zone) the killer turned out to be one of the towns police deputy's
Nice job by the Moscow police. Everyone needs to be patient and believe that the perpetrator(s) of this heinous crime will be brought to justice.
BULLSTUFF!!!
Well done, precise, to the point
Peacefully protest like they did the murder of George Floyd😮😮
You can wipe that look off your face, cap. Your 36 person team is way, way, WAY out of your league.
Of course gotta slip in excuses... and copslain common sense.  A private citizen will solve this. Police will write about it and give eachother awards and promotions
Start arresting and getting rid of these POS on the internet that think they know something but are just full of sh-t and getting in the way so you people can do your jobs F these internet POS
If you think the police have anything of substance on this case by way of evidence, you are a fool.
How much was the life insurance policy did the university have on those students that was murdered in cold 🩸 blood ❓❓❓
The 2 new crazy stories i read on the Web today was 1. The perpetrator was a cannibal and ate part of one girl  2. The perpetrator used a drone to enter the house and kill the people........ I can only imagine some of the crazy tips the police are getting r/t
The police have nothing.
DONT BLAME ANYONE IF THE POLICE ARE TOO LAZY TO SOLVE THIS!!
DID ANYONE HAVE CAMERAS AROUND THE HOUSES????
You can't catch the killer, you haven't experience, knowledge, you're a looser. Ask help from NYPD and FBI. And change the name Moscow . Get lost
Stand up for your Rights
Damn this case is cold as fuck lmao
This department is just as bad as Uvalde
Carry a gun
Both the chief and this nice man seem really kind and wise, nobody can dislike the Santa beards ♥️ Hope they catch him/them soon.
The toxicology reports show that all the student victims were high on drugs and that is why they did not resist their attacker.  So sad.
My heart and prayers go out to the victims and their families.❤🙏I appreciate the Chief coming out with this post. I’m sure he wants to solve this case ASAP. I also believe the LE are all working hard to solve this horrible murder. God bless them all.
Murders of the most brutal are happening all over the wesr coast and state touching them, and the states keep taking our rights to bear arms and defund police, buckle up people this is only gonna happen more and more now that it's obvious that authorities can't solve a thing lmao
Probably crackheads involve the criminal behavior
This interview is a whole lotta nothing!
Can't even give a bit more detail than just a white car after all this time. 🙄
Got to feel a little sorry for this dude.. Up to this point in his career all he had to worry about in his cozy little college town were drunk college students and speeders and within one evening Moscow Idaho has become as big a news story as Moscow,Russia
Captain Lanier You pull this off You and Moscow PD will be America's Heroes.
Sounds like they know as much as they did  last month.
That was some fine uhaul driving the other day. 😂 How many officers did it take to get out of the driveway?
God Love him, he’s has nothing.
This case reminds me of the movie "Brigham City". Quite possibly life imitating art.
"tips, calls, and online tips" (online tips are different than "tips" how?) "an update based on the information we have to this point" (yeah, that's what an update is... As opposed to a final report). "We believe, based upon our investigation" (no duh based upon your investigation. What else would your beliefs be based upon? Dreams? LSD trips?). Just speak English. Stop trying to sound all sophisticated. It's police work. It's not freaking brain surgery. You can talk like a normal person. There's no actual technical jargon involved.
They said they want a prosecution they said they want a conviction--not an arrest. That's telling.
Basically this update is nothing new.No wonder the families are frustrated over the investigation. I am so sorry for the families,💜
Screw your timeline! We already know the timeline, let’s solve the murder now! And there’s “hours of footage” from businesses, homes, and gas stations but they only need to look at two specific times, before and after 3am. And you are saying that you cannot give out any more information for the respect for the families, but the families are angry and want answers or any kind of clue as to what happened. It has been a month, this is an absolute joke and anyone who thinks otherwise wouldn’t understand unless it happened to someone they love.
The crime rate has spiked through out America its is robbery &home invasion season from September-Spring time so everyone needs to be careful and the university should have made it known and the Mexican border is close to Idaho and sum of those people that are crossing is terrorist rapist drug dealers and killers please ask Brandon to close the boarders it’s been 10 million or more that has invaded our country
This poor man just looks broken. He has received tons of criticism from people who have no clue how real cases like this work. It’s not as easy as they make it seem on tv and they really shouldn’t be sharing much with the public even though I know that’s frustrating. I believe they are all working their asses off and want this resolved just as much as anyone else. People need to stop being so ignorant and attacking them without fully understanding what all is involved in a case like this.
I figured it had more to do with a potential witness
Im guessing a jealous student went nuts
Prayers to LE that they find this Suspect or if more than one the Suspects. Prayers to the community there for Safety and Students and their Families and Friends. Condolence to the Families and Friends of the 4 Students Murdered. My hope is social media stops putting out rumors and speculation. Justice in the end for the 4 that was Murdered and their Families.
❤
How you check  jack showalker cell phone pin  o search his residence
Great update from the police very well spoken and prayers to all working this difficult case .
If this was done ahead of time with well lit lighting and cameras this could have been prevented this could happen again until Brandon closes the border
He was saying a bunch of nothing.
Thank you!!  Please ask "News Nation "  Lauren Matthis,  to stop throwing out to the public all sorts of ideas and contradictions to your police reports.
I am happy to hear these news. This is. finally a more transparent manner clarify the situation. I am also happy to hear about the multiple investigative teams working in different areas like Salt Lake City etc... May we hope that this tragic case will be solved as quick as possible. Hope that justice will be served to the 4 beautiful souls that lost their souls on that unfortunate early morning.  RIP
VERY eloquent and SMART officer....we are fed up with the IDIOTIC  and cheep click baits of the so CALLED"""""journalistes/Reporters""!!!
We are used to getting everything instantly. I believe you will catch this guy.
From Jacksonville Florida, sending all prayers to family and friends whom lost there loves ones during this heartbreaking moment . I am on this case and it scares me this could be my sisters … and I’d do anything to get JUSTICE. JUSTICE WILL BE AND SOON !
Thank you for update. We're all watching and hoping for a conviction. Sending healing light to all those involved in cracking this case and for resolve for the families. This was a heinous violent crime. The vulnerability of campus living needs a rehaul and this house needs to be destroyed! A memorial in its place. RIP Madison, kaylee, xana, Ethan. May they be rejoined in heaven 🏞✝️🌅🌄🌼🌹🌸🌻🏵🌷💐
"Anything can break this case" - well that to me says they don't have what they need yet.  Praying they get the tip that is needed so these kids will get justice.
so not a single update basically
Thinking of you all, & thank you for your hard work & dedication on this case.
Praying for the families. May this perp be caught
yeah, all you arm chair internet detectives - knock the shit off
Another "Keystone Cops" shit show. Incompetence On Parade.
So if the occupant of the white car is cleared at that time of the morning, that means the killer lives close by within walking distance of the crime 😢
Well done, Moscow PD.
Cold case. Get it out of the news.
Drug related
Your worried about a conviction, really! If you find one good piece of evidence it's game over. The person or persons are guilty. Probably in Mexico by now
I think the car is a red herring. Put out there so the perp thinks they are free. LE knows who that car bongs to & why it was parked there.
I'm about 80% sure they have a suspect right now. They're just waiting in evidence or a break. Maybe a 100 definite ID on the owner of that car to put it all together in a nice bow. Etc. Maybe letting the suspect get a little comfortable while they compile evidence. Maybe still looking for him/them. Plus the way he's talking. Feels like they're building a case. Or trying to
Well that white car is burned up now!! You should have never said that!!
Get your heads out of those phones and start paying attention to your surroundings!!
What's the point of constantly putting out stories if there's no suspect
John S or the guy that was stalking them IS the PERP. (the hoodie guy) the cops and FBI have to be honest with us.He did it according to what I saw in the video from the food truck. Because of his behavior his behavior was very stalker like first staying away from the girls BUT keeping an eye on them later he got closer to them and started a conversation with Joe the fat guy just so he could get closer (he had no intrest in talking to Joe he used him to get close to them that's what psychos do because if you seen the video you can see that as soon as the girls left he took of without a word to fat Joe he already was in killer mode as he walked away and if you guys noticed he was walking with a purpose and just before he went around the corner he sped up he went to the girls house and I THINK he hurt Kaylee worst because she was making fun of him and tried or did take pics or video of him. Psychopaths don't like anyone making fun of them AT ALL. he got to the house first harmed the couple first and sat and waited for the girls to arrive and waited for them to fall asleep and thats when he did what he did. I don't know who hoodie guy is but he is being protected by some very important people parents rich maybe...those are my thoughts. if you noticed too the Captain giving the update he looked and acted unsure and nerveous and didn'tseem to me like he is at all in charge anymore. something VERY fishy is going on here. and a telling thing too is no one else was there BUT the Captain to give out info or updatse on ALL they are doing. where is the FBI? and also the four very suspicious guys that went thru the house. I"m sure hoodie didi it.
Praying for the families
I wonder what is in these “suspicious notes” some people are receiving in Moscow and calling the police about. Also a few reports of businesses receiving “suspicious” and “harassing” phone calls.
The poor officer they see too much.
Yo killer was a rando a drifter he had some kind of contact with the poor folk involed he killed then caught a freight train out of sandpoint idaho and went to seattle sorry to say this is his first kill he will do it again the knife should be easy to hunt down RIP ANGELS
So you should always be vigilant and scared, because a rare and random event might happen to you? We live in a world where parents are afraid to let their children play outside because something terrible happened to child across the country a few years ago. The publicity and exploitation around one parent poisoning his child ruined Halloween for millions of children and ended traditions of homemade treats. Sure, the students in Moscow should practice extra caution until this is solved, but the idea that we should treat our communities like war zones is damaging to those communities. The are costs to too much caution. Humans are bad a risk assessment, but we have to come to terms with media that hypes and expands rare events like a murder in Moscow, ID.
I'm sure this is wearing on you and if unsolved will haunt you for the rest of your life. Wishing you a break.
The killer's family knows! They need to report him!!
Cold case
They just need to admit that they have no leads at all and their investigation is going nowhere
This crime needs to be solved
This is a good man with genuine feelings and concern. Do not disrespect these people, there are multiple agencies involved doing their ultimate job. There were four victims not one! DNA x 4 etc etc etc. Video surveillance not just the food van. Mind your business and hang like the rest of us. This murder is so shocking and devastating. It is every parents nightmare. Kids killing kids due to obsession and a deranged sense of misogynistic entitlement.
In other words no update.
I’ve learned nothing new from this update.
I'm very sorry for the loss. Lock your doors and put a stick in your window track, at the least.  Close your drapes and blinds at night.  Don't let stalkers learn your indoor home and habits, just by lurking and looking through your windows. Do you know how many men walk around all night long, trying doors?  He was out there amongst us before the murders.   But people act like we're in more danger now.
they should not ask to the public for tips ,,99% of people are jokers
God bless you all! You are our countries unsung heroes! We love you and pray for you!
This Police Officer has said the exact same thing for a month. He says: We are looking at evidence, we are following up on tips, we are talking to people, blah, blah, blah.  He doesn't know ANYTHING.
Keep up the good work. Prayers are with the families,
How do they know the year of the model so precisely? 2011-2013 is fairly specific. That would indicate that they know who the “occupant” is.
Come on you guys got this!!! prayers for all the families and LE my heart breaks for all.
Praying for all the families and the police to solve this soon andeveryonesafefrom the monster who did thos
Captain Lanier and Moscow Police you're doing a great job and you and all concerned are in my prayers.
Thos has Barney Fife written all over it. I'm not sure who's leading this investigatiin but it's a absolute circus.
John3:16 ❤️This is for everyone
So whats the update ?
That was really awesome of him...  clear, concise, logic and reason!
They want a conviction and ‘more than just an arrest’? That’s something, I suppose. So, they suspect Jack S. They can prob get an arrest warrant but are hoping for more evidence. Totally circumstantial at this point.
The problem is, hardly anyone for good reason trusts LE.  You are a small town easily swayed by money, reputation, and bright colors.  I for one, trust the parents and the PI!
Captain Lanier speaks of vigilance and he is referring to a small town with little crime. Those of us who live in areas much more dangerous should especially take his advice to heart.
😢
So basically no news. Ok then
Seems pretty hopeless. So I take it there was NO blood evidence from anyone other than the victims? Why can’t they tell us this? Why can’t they tell us why they eliminated both the Jacks? Were they both physically interviewed and cleared (no injuries)?
Thank you for your hard work. Praying praying for you all and the families during this time. Praying whoever did this is caught soon.
I feel that they must have finally met with the family and let them know some details to ease their minds because i haven't seen Mr. Goncalves in the last few days.  I think this was well said and something that needed to have been said already.
Thank you for this update.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
No new info. What's with his statement around 30 seconds he says we believe the vehicle was around area and not we know or are sure about vehicle,still think red herring
#justice4idaho4!
TLDR:  There has been no significant progress ... We still have no clue. We continue to blunder through "evidence" .. We should be done by 2035.
I send much love and prayers to the family from austria in europe!!!!
RIP kids🌹🌹🌹🌹 Prayers 🙏🏼 justice must be served! Sending prayers From 🇪🇺
Hey when you have a party house and at food truck drunk / high and telling someone f you this kind of life style and a lot of people know the code to front door and the sliders with no sticks in them the person or person's or killer/ killers new everyone that lived there and they all party together with the killer/ killers these people had a rep and people new it . The killer or killers / friend new Kaylee didn't have her bed anymore the killer / killers / friend was with them that night when they where all out and about they left them and hid in the house before they all return
It’s a damn shame they haven’t been able to solve this as of yet…. Imagine all the other cases that were and have been piling up on their desks… At some point, unless they crack this case soon ….. it too will unfortunately be set aside ..
I would think the owner of that white vehicle would have reached out by now if they really wanted to help. If it was me I would  with no hesitation.  I'm sure with the news media coverage they  already know that the Police is interested in speaking with them.  I dunno maybe people are just spooked.
Such a tough job. I hope they get the conviction and whoever did this gets punished with the full weight of the crime. So awful. Justice must come for these families.
Its almost Christmas…I cant imagine the depths of sadness these young peoples parents, families will feel. May they all rest in peace and Bless the parents and I pray that whom ever did this is caught and brought to justice. It is still unimaginable for this to happen in the Moscow/Pullman area. Please stay safe be vigilant
I don’t think this conference offered any peace to anyone. If anything all it did is show a lot of snarkiness but said in a polite tone. Stating people shud b aware of their surrounings regardless of this case…no $hit Sherlock but ur small private community is asking if there is a direct threat & up until now ur little community felt safe & that’s why there r asking. 2nd to go and complain that people r consoling about their wait timers to report anything to the police and for him to say this case isn’t the only case in America was again so unnecessary and all these police r doing is showing they have no clue how to is has impacted their city/town and the last thing people need is a jerk police officer that doesn’t have answers and instead calls a conference to b a smart a$$ in a very friendly tone. I don’t like these officers and I get they r working hard and it’s their biggest case they have had but perhaps if they spent some of the free time they used to have on sensitivity classes or how to speak with people, perhaps they wudnt b where they were and wudnt have so many people mad at them and hounding them.  This police department needs a wake up call becuz they have proven they r not capable of handling a case this big.
What about the neighbor? Something is off with that
I would look for a hunter /military type that  has knife skills, and has a grudge against college students, hates women in particular, and lives by himself.. Maybe this person keeps souvenirs of the crime, and that could be his downfall. If you find him hang him, anything less would be an injustice.
What about the other guy they found dead in a river a few months ago. They quickly called it an accidental death, shut case.  This police dept. have no idea what they're doing.
The chief wants no more talk of upper deckers! His investigators have turned over every tank lid in town looking for corn, peas, carrots, or other evidence leading to the perpetrator of that sinister upper decker.
Why are they saying King Rd instead of Queen Rd.?  The back of the property as shown during the investigation is located on Queen Rd. - King Rd appears to be the former front entrance to this property.
5:20 says it all correct. I think they have someone on there radar. Then just need the evidence to convict. Prayers they get the proof soon.
PRAYERS TO ALL THAT ARE INVOLVED AND LOST A LOVEONE... JUSTICE FOR IDAHO4!!!!
Its good to get an update. I'm in Scotland, but this is such a horrific crime. I really hope you all stay safe. And this creature is caught. And put in a cage ASAP.
Who ever did this is a sick sick person, or persons. I worry for students at both the college at Moscow and those just across the Idaho/Washington border who attend Washington State @ Pullman. My granddaughters had left Pullman not long before this happened as well as my daughter and her husband and I am so glad they are no longer in that area. This person or persons is a monster and both cities (Moscow and Pullma) are in real danger. Bring your kids who are students at either college home, they can make up studies lost when its safer.
They told nothing!
So nothing new essentially
The safety comments make me cringe - these people were in pairs and home.  That didn't make the public feel warm and cozy.
Amateur sleuths / podcasters trying to benefit from this tragedy.... SHAME ON THEM!
The university need to get everyone to give DNA, if they don’t comply they’re taken off course. For those who have graduated this year also. It could be vital if they found a match between someone from the university to something found at the house.
These cops are way over there head.  They cleared the rich boy with the parental connections.  And now we know Jack S lives right next store to the girls.  He hunts he was kicked out of his sorority for killing animals and putting them on porches.  He was stalking these girls
I will continue to pray for Moscow PD.
From hearing the fathers graphic butchering of his daughter,  the killer  now completely satisfied has engrained himself back in society
Going nowhere
Here we go with the car again.  This is a  distraction.  It's been a month and not one word about a car until now.  Having no leads
LE is doing all they can to bring resolution to this case.  The Dad is not helping with his rants
This buffoon is in over his head this is the most incompetent police force in the country and this iddiot wants to say shit about people doing their job well dont be incompetent and public would have no reason to help what a BlTCH this terd is this piss me off so much
"Anything could break this open for us"...doesn't sound good
This case has gotten even more hard core. Fox has an article with Kaylee's Dad Steve.  Evidently the coroner described big open gouges to the victims.  Kaylee's lungs and liver were slashed.  Evidently the couple downstairs put up quite a battle according to the article.  This is the work of a real psychopath.  No wonder the Dad is pissed.
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you very much.
Basically, they know nothing.  I feel very bad for the families.
Occupant may have seen something....not! Occupant is the killer. Surely police must have a few suspects narrowed down by now. This killer may have unalived himself by now and we won't know his motive.
needing enough information to convict. that's where the rubber meets the road.
Kaylee's dad seems like he wants you to release more info. We CAN'T send in tips if we don't know what to look for.
💥👍🏼🤎
Likely a police officer did this
Why is social media a distraction? Just ignore it and do your job…
What makes me so angry are the people who are using this tragedy for subscriptions / money while pointing a finger at innocent people who are now receiving death threats. These people should be sued for slander not to mention the misinformation is hurting the investigators. I live in Idaho & our updates are saying they will start crackling down on these people & if needed charges will follow. This is a difficult case & I'm sure traumatic for the people involved in trying to solve it. I hope we all get a resolution soon. And then maybe all those people crawling out for subscriptions will be seen for the maggots they truly are!
Gods speed and guidance.. thank you for all your hard work in this ongoing investigation.
Please remember more then likely the perp lives within 25 miles of crime.  Also go beck to the beginning don’t make mistake that Delphi did. Check out Alibis
We're praying you solve this ASAP. My heart and prayers goes out to the families.
Mark eleven twentytwo.
All of you are a joke police FBI and anyone else that is  involved you have no idea what you're doing not enough schooling in these kinds of situations.You have dirtied the crime scene so badly that you've made it extremely difficult now. If they had proper schooling this could have been solved and for the life of me I can't understand why you can't find this car it can't be that difficult insurance registration ect. but you did not do that. The car could be anywhere now my theory is the car is either underwater or it's been stripped and maybe crushed at this point or it's buried somewhere. You have all completely screwed this case to the point that you'll be lucky to find anyone.🇨🇦⚔️
Nice update. Classy to mention these four young people by name. Just so you know I am praying daily for the same thing, that is, that the One who sees everything will guide you to an arrest and a conviction.
Taking four promising lives people that had a  bright future and we're doing something with their lives to model citizens
Some one should be watching out for the police officers in the Mosscow town, for some reason the police smile and laugh about the murders of the four people.
Soo basically ….. Update: no update … ridiculous
This sucks!  Truly does.  I feel so bad for the families involved.  I'm sorry, but I feel they're not even close to finding a suspect/ suspects
In 2 words: nothing yet
Where do we go then to get the updates from them 🤣
The killers family may know or suspect something. This person won’t stop so do the right thing!
I might believe they're looking for an eyewitness (perhaps) so they can get a warrant signed to nab this guy... can't arrest him on circumstantial evidence. Likely tons of circumstantial evidence right now, since they have so much video. Still not enough though to get a conviction, as we all know... Cough cough Casey Anthony
Yep you have to work for hours ...that’s called a job 👍.   We all work for hours buddy . Nobody feels bad for you.
I think the police have the suspect in their crosshairs!!
I could of given the EXCACT same update. A while ago actually
I know they’ll solve it. Praying they get a DNA match this week!
BE Vigilant=see something=say something
Roommates are the key that might seen they poeple from the black suv park in front of the house with girl we know those roommates was still up ..they might have been up when girls go home
5:20 says it all.
Kudos to Law Enforcement from all agencies for the immense amount of work they are conducting in this case. Please take care of yourselves and focus on what you need to do to process this crime scene and conduct your investigation. YOU do what YOU know you need to do to maintain the integrity of this investigation. Keep up the great work.  We have your back.
District Attorneys need to start Prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law if you have a career criminal that is out there murdering people maybe you should think about putting it down before it assaults another inmate or staff or gets out and commits more murder
Father's mother's others alike that have kids don't you know that you're responsible for their safety you should teach them self-defense get them self defense classes otherwise harm might come to your kids don't believe me let's do research and statistics in data tell me what you see I know what I see if there would have been neighborhood watch in this community like other communities this could have been prevented if people would get off their lazy asses and have not provide safety in their Community by forming neighborhood watches then maybe they should gather up some of that good money instead of giving it to the churches maybe they should buy security with it and for their neighborhoods specially being a God isn't protecting your neighborhood your church has yet to come in and resolve peace and prevent murders child kidnappings child molestations rape just to name a few more crimes
To all the Geniuses out there put something in your door like a string a piece of tape or something go check the doors before entering your home or business to see if that thing has been tampered with if it has notified 911 somebody might be in that building your home that you locked up and secured
Looks like the killer got away with it, if they didn't find something in the first week, then they're not going to find something.
Would Gabby Petito's body been found without the intense world-wide interest from social media?
Wow some of the stuff that Captain is saying is what I and other professional people had said to others and yet people want to take their asses and wear them as thinking caps I said taking their heads and shoving them up their asses stop taking your heads and shoving up the gases stop wearing the asses it's thinking caps stop praying about it as praying does not resolve things neighborhood watches informing neighborhood watches resolve things traveling in groups and pairs that resolves things got to hear in the back of your neck that stands up that tells you hey that something might be bad off don't go doing it
No, we want more than a conviction, we want the death penalty for this monster.
What does the emperor do when the people become restive and start asking questions? He creates a circus.
At this point that white car probably doesn't exist anymore it's either underwater or stripped and and recycled I be checking the water around the area lakes rivers ponds whatever. And for the life of me I can't understand why they can't find this car it's a simple process which it seems to be out of the league of these detectives police and FBI they're obviously is no training here as we've seen in the past. I think there needs to be more schooling than training anyway that's my opinion I feel for the families.🇨🇦⚔️
Why do they update on nothing. Why don't they just don't give an update at all till?  Suspect
Basically they have nothing
Sounds like LE are zeroing on someone.
This is such a difficult situation for everyone involved. My continued prayers for the families and law enforcement. Both sides are dealing with unbelievably difficult situation in this senseless, horrific, tragedy.  ❤❤❤❤🙏🙏
His comment about, not just wanting to make an arrest but actually get a conviction, seems to suggest they have someone (or more than one) identified and are waiting for further/better evidence to confirm their suspicions. This could be forensics (DNA), alibi, etc to help build a solid case. If this potential perpetrator hasn't committed a crime and has no DNA on file, this may be the stumbling block or it could just be that they are waiting on the DNA confirmation from the labs for someone who is in the database.
Its good this guy is at least attempting to specifically address all the youtubers and rumours and b.s.  Unfortunately I don't think it'll help much coz the types of people who talk all the b.s. in these things are gonna do it regardless *sigh*
In other words "We don't know crap..."  C'mon offer a reward, stir some sh#t.  Do something! One month? You don't have any specific details to release, Going Cold...
They kept saying this perp was really sloppy, but it's been a month and no one arrested.
There was really no need for this update….🤷🏻‍♀️
The cops are delusional.  They are backtracking. The parents should raise a reward to solve this murder.
Sending love to the families of those 4 angels. My heart cries with yours. This must be incredibly hard to have suffered so much grief and loss and then have no major breakthrough on this case. We are all praying that LE will bring about Justice. That there are committed and honest officers working to solve this gruesome murders.
not much of an update
Might as well have said nothing.
And not be looking down at thete phone texting when walking
I'm sorry but what's the update on the case? ....bc I didn't catch one.
Thank you for confirming reasons for white car search. Any tidbit helps us grasp more about this most horrible murder, an event that will be studied for years and years to come.   And, safety! Do you want to discuss what these girls missed? What they could have done?  We have millions of pretty girls who are scared now. Please help guard and give them protective advice.
When I watched the first broadcast at the crime scene I noticed that it was apparently garbage pickup day in the neighborhood and I was wondering if those garbage cans were searched for evidence as a fleeing suspect may have discarded bloody clothing of even the murder weapon in a garbage can and may have left blood evidence on the lid if they opened the can. I also saw an officer open a can with their bare hands, look inside and replace the lid thereby compromising evidence left on the lid.
God bless this incredible Police Chief.  He lives and breathes these disgusting murders every minute of every day.  xox
So no update at all poor victims and the killer is stout there at large. He will strike again I am sure of it, cops need to see a pattern and that means the killer will strike again before caught
If there hasnt been an arrest it is clear that the killer lives alone and there isnt anyone to phone the Police about his suspicious activity, especially at 4 AM on the night of the murders. This tells me that the killer is definately an exconvict. The difficult part is knowing how he came into contact with Kaylee. He must have seen her in a Bar somewhere and overheard her or spoke with her, in order to hate her to the point of Rage. I suspect he is a Barfly and probably from Pullman. Keeping an eye on the Bar scene is critical. No doubt he is a hunter and I wonder which hunting club he frequents.  Good luck Police.
I got news for you buddy, you’re gonna need a license plate if you want that car
Be careful because we don’t know anything 😢
Thank you for your hard work!  Prayers from central Illinois! 🙏❤
Prayers for the victims family members.  Praying there will be justice soon!!! Please lead them to the murderer(s)   Nobody should have to go through this senseless killings.  Please lead the police to the right people.  Lay hands on the family members and send a comforter.  Let the Angels come and lead the way.
Anyone complaining about the information given is selfish. Let them do their job. This shit doesn't happen over night. Yall want to complain from behind your phones in your safe space comfort zones while these dudes are working day and night to investigate and build a case.  If they don't get it right, they don't have a 2nd chance. Stop with the cowardly childish tantrums and grow up. Let them work. And go back to your safe space tik tok coffee.
great way to say nothing
so, they haven't identified and interviewed the occupants of the Hyundai yet...too many tips, I guess....
Great spokes person! Finally explanations and not nothing.
