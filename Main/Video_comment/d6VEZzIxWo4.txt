When the own goal happen Mbappe pushed Messo to get to Neymar
Team bending to Mbappe giving him penalties. He is SHIT at penalties so why give him???
Dude wtf is wrong with mbappe 6:41 aint even attacking
yeah peopel say neymars just a flopper but he actually is top 10 player... and hes showing hes top 5 rn
They rather failing a zero chance shot than passing the ball to Messi who was alone uncountable times. Whatta bunch of morons
Neymar >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Mpimbe
If Mbappe lose penalty, don't worry he will score anyway.
This team can't win the CL. You can't play Neymar, Messi, and Mbappe at the same time because you lose the pressing game. Those three are not going to defend from the front which means they will find it difficult to beat teams like Liverpool, Man City, and RM.
Donatelo is not happy
lol 77
2:38 You have Messi. Why are Mbappe and Neymar ever taking a penalty? 7:26 Just plain amazing.
Don't put your trust in men- put your trust in God. Jesus is coming soon and it's time to repent. We are all sinners in need of a Savior. No one is perfect. We cannot earn salvation. It is a free gift from God. Mary doesn't save you, confessing to a priest doesn't save you, religion doesn't save you, self-help doesn't save you, meditating doesn't save you, Buddha doesn't save you. Only faith in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection saves you. The Father gave His only begotten Son to die for our sins, and whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. Cry out to Him now. He loves you so much... but He won't force Himself on you. True love allows freedom to choose. If you don't want Him, He'll give you what you want - eternity without Him in hell. If you genuinely admit you're a sinner and need His sacrifice to pay for your sins, He will cover your debt and give you life forever with Him in heaven. I hope and pray you choose life.   This is realer than you could ever imagine.

KDB or Neymar for ballon d’or 2023
3:59 Nice tap bro 🤣🤣🤣
Messi’s vision is truly something else
Mbappe needs to learn humility
Mbappe lost my respect. Dudes lost in his ego and doesn’t pass the ball. Little baby cry.
Mbappe is a waist!! He is a ball hog, just trash. Neymar and Messi have great chemistry when they play together
Neymar is going in this season. Need to see him on demon time this year. I hope this mbappe situation inspires the best ney in years. He knows its WC year too.
10:38 why wasn’t this counted? Wasn’t he onside?
What a boring league
Seems like even the commentator was trying to stir the pot with mbappe and neymar, can't help himself
If only PSG was dominant in Europe as they are in France. 😣😣😣
Mbappe MISSED ANOTHER PENALTY WHAT A CLOWN! WORST PLAYER ON THE TEAM, NEYMAR IS PENALTY MASTER.
The clip you came for mbappe 6:37
U can tell there’s no more chemistry between Neymar and Mbappe.
Neymar is back
This is the most selfish I’ve ever seen from Mbappe
This psg team but Neymar and Messi all seem like they hate themselves
Worst highlight ever had to go back to make sure it’s from a legit source
Leo 👑
the new psg coach is so good
mbappe is playing horrible this game
i love neymar jr seeing him play at the level we all know he is capable and hungry sincerely makes my day better
Let’s hope this play translates to bigger games as well… and pls don’t let Mbappe take pens anymore
8:25 that night night 👌👌
Imagine if Mbappe ever passed
Fer artista in YouTube hsje
Fer artista in YouTube gshe
Fer artista in YouTube gshe
Omlin had a great game tho!
Neymar showed Mbappe how to take a pen 😎
Mbappe should be fourth choice of penalty taker  He is not qualified to take penalty before Messi Neymar or Ramos  Guy have no respect for the legends ... shame on him
Neymar I love his penalty kicks lmaoooo
Messi is feared by teams … he didn’t score but he made the other team focus and him and he made the assist … that team will win champions league 100% this year
Did neymar not score 3? Did I miss something?
This could’ve been 10-0
What happend to the third goals for Neymar?
I mean what do you expect 💀 for them  lose 5-0 , like come on
Midbappe doesn't look like he wants to be there
I don’t think the colour commentator says “Phil” enough.
I keep thinking that Kazri dude is Roberto Carlos
world cup years = hungry players.
Mbappe has a problem with Messi—I know I sound crazy. His ego is off the charts because he won a few games against the GOAT when Messi was out of his prime and in shitty teams. I was so hoping that Mbappe would have went to Madrid this summer but that greedy man child stayed so he can sabotage PSG.
Mbappe is so incredibly overrated
Mbappe is not a team player. He always plays for himself.
Donnarumma had two shots on goal and both were converted to goals. The first one he left a live ball in the small box. The second one, he gave up his goal side. I am sorry but you do that in big games and you're done. I feel sorry for Navas. He deserves better.
Mbape is ass,  bro is like a reject Ronaldo
Keylor navas is the best 🥺
Bein sports USA and the stupid narrators are in brazilian
Kilian Mbappe!! Never ever you irrespect LEO MESSI!!!  HE had a lot of time playing like a best. You are 23 just running and gol. But no one is like Messi!! You have opportunity for learn of him. Don't be ridiculous!!!!
Hopefully Mbappe ego’s gets him kicked out. That way PSG can bring in Ronaldo and then we can see Messi, Ney and Ronaldo play together at last
Ironic how mbappes selfishness and childish behavior will cost psg the cl
every since the mbappe contract bro thinks he owns the world
Mbappe bro grow up SMH 🤦‍♂️
Mbappe isn’t the best player on that team 💀 dude thinks he is bc two of the worlds greatest really let their hunger to win burn out and the other was still in shock for a season getting kicked out his home bc they couldn’t pay rent turtle needs to learn
Mbappe 🤦‍♂️
6:37 ...why did he stop the run? ... could have ended up with a goal had he continued that run🤦
i’m sorry but i don’t give a damn who mbappe is or thinks he is, if neymar is on the pitch he’s taking the penalties, the guy is sickening from the spot, never gives the keeper a chance, the master of mind games! i mean i could watch neymar take penalties all day long talk about ice cold from the spot omds
Bein sports managed to remove Mbappe's bad attitude on the field.
Mbappe really starting to show hes the liability.... Penalty miss, over dribble.😂😂😂 they were hating on my man ney
I’m a Messi Fan I and do think he’s the Goat but honestly is sad just watching him play like this😭
Hakimi is team Mabbpe , he could have cut back to MESSI
Mbappe looks so frustrated, ego is bad. I pray he gets of that feelings or thoughts. He’s still a kid
i knew messi play false 9 and mbappe and ney up top is a perfect lineup
Psg play better without mbappe tbh mbappe wastes so many chances they need to treat mbappe like a normal player instead of constantly funnelling balls to him.
Sergio ramos just man handled mbappe
Neymar Ballon D Or year Loading….
Trash league. I don’t know why Neymar and Mbapee enjoy being in a league where they dominate almost all games. Psg will not win champions ones again. Hala Madrid!!
Mbappe is final form Marcus Rashford 😂
Say what u want about ney but i can see the passion coming back ↗
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                .////////////////////////////////./
I am a PSG fan and I think PSG will turn south pretty soon. There are too much conflicts surfacing. They are all top players and they should have egos. Its like a company with many CEOs..... Coach first priority is to settle everyone's expectations... formation, winning, etc are secondary at this stage
Psg switching to a back 3 is the best thing they could’ve done. They play more fluid football then when they did with pochitino
If we really want to be honest, if anybody should be taking the penalties for PSG, it should be.................... no, as a Barca fan, I won't say it, because then I would throw up.
MBAPPE CAN'T SCORE : PENALTIES OR FREE KICKS.
Mbape must change his penalty style. He has to develop another system. The current one is simply not working.
Tf is up with Mbappe acting like that dude looks like he lost his motivation to play
Jesus loves you!
I love this Messi and Neymar duo. Reminds me of their Barcelona times
Mbappe need to let go of his ego and fit in, stop tryna be personal
I love soccer
that goalie is so bad! put Navas back
To whomever reading this: wishing you the best rest of your day/night! Remember, what we think..... We Become
Having an American play by play is weird
And they blamed messi and Neymar when mbappe is the one who think who thinks the team runs through him
Sanches went to psg?? Nooo 🪦😪
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing ✝️
In my opinion they should switch Mbappe with Messi for pens
Boring farmers league
Farmers league
Mbappe is going to cost this team a lot if he doesn’t change his egoistic ways.
Horrible commentators
I was hoping they let Neymar go so he can come back to hunt them, but the new coach knew better.
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Its clear that messi already knows mbappe wont pass so he just waits them out🤣🤷‍♂️
This league seems boring 😴
They won't win the CL when they're not being challenged in the regular like this
Something seemed off about Mbappe, looked unhappy for whatever reason
Man my iPhone can record better quality then this
Mbappe should learn how to pass the ball
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔴🟥
They are better without mbappe
I know most of us are waiting for the meltdown but PSG looking all business so far this season. If Neymar is pressing things are definitely changing
It’s clear that Neymar’s motivated…hopefully he has the season of his career
Mbappe you can tell his ego is getting to him
Mbappe looks mad the whole game I think he feels left out by Messi and Neymar, but again hakim acts as if Messi doesn’t exist
Mbappe thinks he deserves the ballon dor 😂😂😂
Number 1 on trending crazy
That blonde headed guy should not be allowed on the pitch again 😂 he left Neymar to just head in that second goal and caused own goal and he’s always just standing surprised whenever psg scores😂
🤣🤣🤣 esa liga asta el betis la gana
Ok.
nice
MBappe is the best manger and owner psg have ever had it his might win a ucl with him and their main striker mbapay
mbappe needs to go, there I said it
3:59 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Messi is a better cf than mbappe lets be honest. Mbappe would be a good winger cutting inside, but he is giving me selfish player vibes this game. Him having an attitude and not learning anything from messi and neymar who in their prime would dog the absolute shit out of this psg mbappe. He should have transferred to Real, it would have been better for psg and him
is anyone noticing that bein sports is blurry unlike prem league videos?
Neymar-Messi duo is most definitely back, and as individuals Neymar is playing outstanding and Messi us also playing very well and the whole psg team is playing well now, huge improvement 👏
Mbappe is the problem for PSG, Yes, he did carry them last season, yes he is a good player, but he’s not a team player and kills PSG energy, they were doing good without him, I hope this changes before champions league
MBappe goal was incredible, Neymar goals were amazing and Messi assists, out of this world.   I want to see MBappe and Messi scoring more goals.
mbappe had so many chances to pass to messi or neymar but instead chose to be selfish and shoot from the tight angles
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
score line looks nice but it was pens and deflections mostly. they are connecting better though.
Props to Montpellier goalie, 10shots on goal and he saved most of them so beautifully
Mbappe looks so salty that neymar scored 2 goals and he’s playing like trash.
Psg doing well so far hopefully they can keep it up
PSG will suffer with Donaruma, small mistakes make you  lose games
Ok im sorry but how is that 2nd pen given? If anything it hits Messis arm...
PSG ligue 1 champions 😂
Mbappe seems like he doesn't want to be there 😂
whoever edits these videos should be fired. Take a look at NBC's premier league highlights and learn from that
El psg es una vergüenza de equipo
is THERE any TEAM that CAN stop PSG??? like wtf they make em seem impossible to beat!!!!
Let’s hope this play translates to bigger games as well… and pls don’t let Mbappe take pens anymore 😭
In. a team sport, attitude  is very crucial and can help a player even improve, as well as his/her team. Mbappe needs to curb his behavior. He should not  try to chance Messi and Neymar with every opportunity. He should respect his seniors no matter how good he is.
Mbappe is a spoiled brat
Very happy for Sanchez way to go buddy 👏👏👏👏
Mbappé is back with his selfishness!
This was really boring😮‍💨😮‍💨
Don't forget y'all world cup is this winter so these guys are going to be on their A game until then
5:09 Mbappe trying to play like Messi!!! I think he needs a lot of work to  play like the GOAT...,
i really want them to buy a defensive mid who is aggressive in mid to help messi so messi can focus on attacking mid instead
Mbappe is a cancer to this team get him out
3:30 I want to see hatters say again, oh he did not meant to do that flick to Neymar last match. He did the same thing again for himself. 6:45 Sometimes I do not understand players, there is Messi wide open drop back easy goal. Hakimi goes here selfishly. 10:30 Sublime pass to Neymar again.
VAR sucks so bad
Bro I don’t know what’s going on With Donnaruma this dude was a beast with Milan and his National team Italy ever since he joined psg his performance dropped drastically
NEYMAR 😈💫
Mbappe, come on, pass the ball man!
Neymar never miss the pk
I’m here from the man United game it was up next 😮
As Mbappe fan, i’m pretty upset with him tbh that he got so many chances to pass the ball to someone else but he just kept shooting in narrow area and wasted!
why the resolution is still like 10 years ago?
Everyone shut up and stop talking about our best player, coach, and sporting director Mbappe. If he gets angry, he will sell Messi and Neymar. Keep talking if that's what you want.
Messi and Neymar is magic but Mbappé with them makes the group ineffective
Can’t believe they’re letting Navas go!!! 🤬🤬 Donnarumma will make so many errors in UCL… mark my words. Letting Keylor go will be a huge mistake.
Why was Neymar's goal in the 85th called back?
11:23 was there no var? or is there only var where there’s no money?
messi ... starts every play goat
I’m my opinion mbappe was probably acting like that because he was hurt for a couple of games and now need to step up his game or maybe something happened that we don’t know
I hate mbappe. Such and arrogant prick
I’m glad beinsports don’t broadcast la liga games. I hated this commentator saying clement lenlglet’s name. He would say longleg lmao
I’m so happy sanchez is in psg woooo now paul please
Even celebrating very unnatural
Messi is enjoying his salary without the pressure of lifting a whole team on his back…
baby girl Neymar go and try to win real teams
Stupid  clown
Mbappe looks unhappy. It seems as though he regrets his decision to stay at psg..
Nejmar is complete IDIOT
I look forward to Mbappe sulking, being juvenile and finally having a meltdown with PSG losing in the UCL again 🤣
Like Some one said!! THE FARMERS LEAGUE IS BACK “
No one is going to talk about that own goal, that guy could have just let it go, no way that was a mistake
Mbappe se ve incomodo
Mbappe no place on this team. 4-4-2 beter, with Messi and Neymar in front
Mbappe should never be taking a penalty when he’s on a team with Neymar and messi
I will never get used to Ramos and Messi on same team
Juega mejor messi y neymar que neymar messi y mbappe mbappe no juega en sociedad
Mbape needs to start passing the ball more.  He wants to do the plays by himself
If im psg ill buy dibu martinez.  Donaruma is horrible.
😂😂😂😂Que mal juega el PSG , todos los goles por errores del rival, un equipo inocente de bajo nivel, Si el PSG tuviera un patrón de juego , mínimo 10 goles , y encima a topo gigio le hicieron 2 goles, parece que la gente no sabe de fútbol.
Mbappe is selfish and never happy when his teammates score. He should've just gone to Madrid.
Mbappe needs to stop taking penalties and hand them to Messi.
The Players looked bored and for them playing at home the fans had zero celebration or excitement lets see how they will perform in the UCL
This is night and day with what Pochettino was putting out. Gatlier is managing circles around the Argentinian. This shows just how shitty of a manager Pochettino was with PSG.
Psg infront of liverpool, Tottenham, bayern, barca real let’s see. They play against weak team and roar about win!
How was Neymar denied a hattrick.  He was onside
Ligue 1 is the worst league in Europe by far. 1 super team and no one else. Convince me otherwise.
This squad won’t get past the champions league quarterfinals...again
Joke league.
Hakimi 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Donnarumma is trash!
2 tiros,2 goles,,,asta q les aga otra regada como la eliminación en champion,,van a confiar en la DONNA,,,pongan a Keylor
You need a better video editor - these highlights were awfully put together
I keep saying Mbappe does Not know how to take penalty kicks. Neymar should be the player to take penalty kicks for PSG, why? Because Neymar uses skills and Not force. He always puts the ball in one side and the goalkeeper on the other side! Also, Neymar is effortless when taking penalty kicks. You see  him studying how to trick the goalkeeper ! Mbappe will never learn how to use skills but he will continue using Force when taking penalty kicks,  and this match is the correct evidence. You saw Mbappe taking penalty kick. He was too fast, he didn't psychologically study the goalkeeper, so that the ball went to one side and the goalkeeper on the other side. Instead, the goalkeeper studied his mind and he got the ball! Neymar has been the best player to take penalty kicks because he uses intelligence before taking it! Messi, CR7 Benzema, Mpabbe etc.. all use force and Not intelligence!  So, PSG really needs to indicate Neymar as their penalty kicks man!
Montpellier goalie played well
Neymar is getting ready for the WC. I wonder if this will be his ballon d or Season
S. Ramos has become a wise boy .......can you believe it ?
PRIME MESSI & NEYMAR DUO 😍😍
Neymar thought he was untouchable until PSG were open to the idea of selling him. My man was having none of it. GG by him.
Mbappe looks like he doesn’t wanna play there anymore
Mbappe is to selfish.
Fuckin Mbappe back with his bad energy
Great team. The crowd though sounds boring
renato sanches is cape verdean but yeah.
This league is an absolute joke 😂😂
Neymar seems to be very motivated to play this time around
Neymar is doing great since PSG put him in the market for sale. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
why are these commentators american anyway?
this is why his futties sbc card should of been 99 rated instead of 98 lul
Please, no more penalties from Mbappé
Is Idrissa Gana Gueye canceled ?
Mbappe looks mad, probably because neymar is stealing the spotlight from him this season.
Messi fans are going say Messi the only reason they won 😂😂😂
Mbappe and donaruma 👎🏻 Messi and Neymar 🥵💪🏼
Bruh this league is a joke
Why isn’t Messi the one taking penalties? He is 3rd in line? Wtf
PSG is untouchable when they play as a team
no way 3rd neymar goal was an offside, so why it was annuled?
Bro get Omlin out of there poor guy
Neymar WC healthy
Except for the 2 goals it was a solid game for Paris. Just need to focus a bit more because the clean sheet was really feasible.
Doesn't matter; they're not gonna go far into the Champions League lmao
mbappe is so greedy bro
Donnaruma is trash, couldve prevented the first goal by pushing it out. He sent it back to a dangerous position
6:38 What is "she" doing?" y'all can see at the bottom of the screen
Neymar balon d or
Yes PSG played well, however, clearly there is an issue with Mbappe. He basically stole the penalty from Neymar only to miss, and then took a ridiculous shot from distance trying to impress. This already smells like trouble but I guess we will see.
Neymar's penalties are the best.
Why is Mbappe taking pens 🤦‍♂️
Renato🤩🤩🤩
9:39 Ramos is so Aggressive!!
please show highlights in time order. VAR review for Neymar's hat trick goal is out of time order.
Ney ready for World Cup.
There ia a problem between Mpappe & Neymar you see it very clearely
Quality is so bad omg. It says 1080p but it's more like 480-720
Neymar wins next champions and World Cup bet money
7:20 why is the keeper looking to punch that ball?
Ngl i didnt know renato sanches signed for PSG.
if one of the the trio Messi, Neymar and Mbappe plays excellent and the other 2 normal/okay…. it’s a deadly team and sharp on positions
The French ligue is so bad, imagine if de bruyne, haaland, or ronaldo played. Easily 30+ goals.
Messi and Neymar are world class together. Mbappe is too selfish
Turtle head is so selfish
Great started for NEYMAR of season 👏 🇧🇷
El porterito en el que se ha convertido donarumma
If only Mbappe would pass the ball.... Messi is always free waiting for this pass back. He is just selfish. 4:22, he scores, but it is just luck. Neymar was alone. Messi was alone too. 6:45. again, he doesn't pass back to Messi who is alone.
Jesus loves you all
Who the tf edits these videos
Mbappe is so ass 😂😂
Neymar is best pk kicker in the world
What’s with Mbappe today? Guy looked bored/apathetic the whole game, even after scoring.
Neymar has a completely different attitude this season and it really shows
Fuera de Francia no son nada
Is it just me but there seems like there is a selfish player among them ......not gonna name names but not messi that's for sure ......
Let's see them in the Champions League
Neymar epic player !
That own goal is 100% MATCH FIXING
Love watching psg, miss seeing di Maria on the pitch w/ those front 3.
PSG need a solid gk those two guys just aren’t making the cut for me
The VAR is a disgrace, it only came to show us how corrupted football is, first penalty kick, was a fault by PSG player to the other team diffender
neymart es mejor que mbappet
Mbappe was never a team player. His glory hunting will ruin PSG's momentum. I'd bench him if I were the coach.
navas better
Mbappe is so wack on penalties
Mbappe is the most selfish player in the world , for sure 👍
"chasing chasing with Messi" while Messi just stands still. That's crazy 7:56
mbappe was kind if being selfish
i really hope mbappe doesn't play selfishly all season
6:43 why not pass Messi is right there tf is Mappe doin
FARMERS LEAGUE LOL
Neymar is coming back. He’s reviving all of the numb skills that he has.
5:11 man this dude is annoying 😒
Great game for Mbappe. The only people hating on his performance are deluded Messi fans. I’ve never seen a more toxic bunch.
It is the World Cup year and Neymar is trying to get fit and ready. He can put on a show any time he wants and be causious not to get injured. Maybe he is trying to silence his critics who wanted him to be sold or bring his value up for future transfer. From the look of Mbappe, he is not happy playing. He acts like he is the captain and missfiring left and right till one shot goes in. I guess his really the decision maker in the team.
Neymar showing mbappè how to do a prefect PK.
Neymar this season has been on fire
Am I the only one who sees some icing between neymar and Mbappe after Neymar hits his penalty?
Mbappe all pace and shite finishing
Psg lookin deadly rn
what a selfish turtle 🐢 🐢 🐢
Messi is the greatest to do it don’t matter if he not in the Ballor dor he already won 7. 😎
Boring!!
Well, Neymar was the man again. Vitinha is not in Renato's class. I tell you something, I am impressed by Ramos ( he look's like a man on a mission so far). Mendes is good but he tries to make one move too many and looses the ball a lot.
Mbappe WORSE PENALTY TAKER!....cant decide what style what corner!...but hes greedy!...clinical he is NOT!!!
Kylian should take PK only when Ney and Messi are not playing.
Mbappe is looking for glory he too  selfish  🤮🤮
Was neymar sending a message to dembele😂
This is league 1 not premier league. The defense looks easily to beat them and no pressing at the high level. If you can score 20 goals in the Premier league, you can score at leat 30 goals in League 1
U didn’t show Mbappe’s BS attitude .
Loved this game, NEYMAR. Messi and Mbappe played on a different level. The whole PSG Squad actually.
The have a lot of selfish players in their squad. Can't win champions league like that. Messi contract ends this year. I don't want him to extend this one year left.
This is the ideal progression for Messi instead of being the scorer his assist and decisive balls and able to break the line is perfect at his age, psg has many attackers with speed best to use them than to overwork himself yes scoring here and there is great but if psg want to win the champions league he needs to stand back and support more and lead the team with his masterclass view of the field
Sorry ass league 💩
that messi assist>>
Man only if mbappe could link with Neymar’s and Messi give and go they’d win it all this year
That diving header from Neymar was so funny 😂
Mbappe needs to pass the ball more often man🤦🏽‍♂️
The goalie
Mbape don’t want to pass the ball
that goalkeeper still had the game of his life shame it was an L
So Neymar didn’t score Hat-Trick???
Something about mbappe. Looks like he doesn’t want to be there.
Mbappe and Messi Have No Connection!😮‍💨😅😂
Mbappe is so like Ronaldo man! I don’t think he is a good combo for Messi and Neymar :(
Neymar better than mbpappe
Sell mbappe
Neymar🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Neymar is the best player
Mbappe will be the downfall of the messi neymar duo unnecessary ball hogging
Mbappe is so greedy and needs to put his ego aside. He’s not helping psg
Another farmer league stats padding game.
imbape is just too immature. it is like all joke to him. glad he stayed in psg.
donoruma is cheeks
w mbappe the ney messi chemistry isnt a thing. needs to be benched tbh.
geez farmers league
psg have a very high chance of winning the champions league this time, pochettino was obviously the fault last season look how many goals they’re scoring now they used to score only 1 goal per game lol
Mbapaypal is a clown🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
If mbappe signed for Real Madrid what would’ve been the result of this Mach
What happened to Neymar's goal at 10:40 ?
why mbappe even playing lmao
Neymar wants it this year
Messi hasn't scored a Free kick for PSG yet
so messi can't score when kylian plays bro?
How was the goal Neymar  offside
This is the strongest paris side we’ve had by far such balance 🇫🇷🙌🏽ICIEST PARIS
Mbappe's new born child can't stop his hunger. We need Mbappe in peak physical condition.
Lazy D up 4-0... and that worries me a little.
Neymar's header was a great play but... Hakimi has to play better... bc that deflection could've gone the other way.
Win is a win but psg Need organization. It looks like bunch of mindless super talented wild horses running around. Too many leaders trying to prove themselves. It will be yet another failure in champions league if they don’t find order and union in the team. They will win France league for sure no doubt with the current state.
Kimpembe and Mendes were sleeping in defense
That header by Neymar was BIG TIME.
Wish they would of gotten rid of Mppape and just have the Argentine and the Brazilian. The team is still under balance.the team need to play through Messi and Neymar should be a supporting player, Mppape is to selfish, they will fall short against better opposition.
Wow what a surprise hahaha
Was it a hatrick?
Hakimi needs to finish that Mendes play.
If Mbappe wants to WIN... then he needs to let Messi take the PK's vs Madrid...
Mbappe missing the PK was a bad omen... bc Messi and Neymar might need to take the PK's...
In a French league Neymar scores and doing that clown 🤡 celebration wow .
Damn! imagine Brazil having Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Vinicius Jr, Raphinha, Antony, Martinelli, Rodrygo and Richarlison as options on that front line! SCARY!! 🇧🇷🔥
That first half touch to Ramos, Hakimi, Messi, Neymar... though stopped, set a tone.
What is wrong with Mbappe’s attitude does he think he’s like a god or something
mbappe penalty 💩
Neymar Ballon D'or!!!!!!
Just going to say it right now, Neymar is the best player in the world
I hope they show this class outside of the ligue 1 they’re a good team really good team it’s just injuries and small mistakes that hold them back :(
*So are we going to talk about that controversial penalty give. to psg?*
Mbappe was not on form today
Mbappe baaaaack yes sir
Nice complete PSG win.  That Mbappe goal was beautiful!
Love watching Neymar play like this, amazing🔥🔥
Another good performance! Galtier is doing well! But this is only Montpellier and much bigger tests await. Neymar and Messi playing very well, Mbappe gonna take 1 or 2 games to be back in full force. Happy for Renato debut goal!!! Vitinha played very well to again! Overall great match, defensively we were good but lapsed on those goals need to improve that.
Aside from the goals, ive never seen psg that defensively composed since tuchel.
Neymar+Messi combination is delightful to watch. They always seem to look for each other. Neymar has been criticized a lot for not performing but he is a man on a mission this season.
Vinícius Rodrigo > mbappe 🤣🤣
Pessi ghosting like usual
Neymar with the Curry celebration. Night night.
