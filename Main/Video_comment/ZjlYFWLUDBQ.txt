I just wanna point out that "5 days of our actual lives" in dnd terms is likely to be anywhere between just over a month to five months because outside of events tables don't normally marathon like this </3
I hope you know i now hear this in my head while playing arc raiders
I sing this song while looting bodies in Arc Raiders.
0:46
Am I the only one who wants to play this song when using the flute in ARC Raiders?
gonna send a kid in a scary costume after my party tonight lets see if the party kills him
why is this such a bop😭
I laugh every time at the "loot that body" part :D
3 nat 20s in a row, an impaitent player derailing the campain with murderhobo shenanigans and then looting the body of the kid they were supposed to find and save definitely sounds like the stuff that would happen in a dnd group with a bunch of friends.
No joke 168th watch of the day 😅😂😂
I listen to this song in loop, I can't stop crying, it's so hilarious
LETSGOOOOOOOO, FOUND IT, NOW I CAN ADD IT TO MY YOUTUBE MUSIC PLAYLIST
0:39 and 0:45 are the best bits for me xd I roll a 1 i roll a 1 ... fuck xd xd
Frigging best song ever.
🎶loot that body🎶
Absolute cinema
Benson Boone is my favorite actor!
I have lost count of how many times I've listened to this song and how many people I have shared the experience with (because this is more than just music) but it just never gets old 💃💃
The villain refused to cooperate in the interrogation.  I rolled for barbarian to torture and kill him.  I, cleric/warlock then rolled for resurrection.  "So....tell me. How's death? You see. I was once a benevolent man. Don't be mistaken, I'm twisted, still. But as you can see. I can kill you *and* heal you anytime. Put curses on you or blessings,......"  "So, let's start again. Would you, (villain's name) disclose the information on the location of Lord Aestroth, OR we could do this whole kill aand resurrect again.....and again......and again. Until either I got bored or you break and went insane. You're choice"
lol
I prefer this video to animation. For reasons that are not unrelated to his short and hip moves. edit: and his moustache and the glasses he wears at 1:30
Cunt Scavino has one chance in 15 minutes to end the chink music mind rape.
btw guys, this is the original
I love this song so much and have been listening to it 24/7 on loop for the past few weeks❤😂 I wish there was a 10 minute long version of it, I love the beat❤❤❤❤❤
that "loot the mf" breaks me every time even after 2 years
this sht hits way too hard
We need a collab with jazz emeu
Bards: "Fuck around and find out"
This tune slaps way too hard
I need a one hour video loop of this
Bards always knowhow to have fun. That is all. 🤭
ah. now i know what your content reminds me of. the mighty bush
1:38 I love the dance here lmao
Ackchually, vicious mockery is a safe and suck. No attack roll required.
I have watched this video 1000s of times and only now just realized his flute is a drumstick.
ah, casual infanticide, a sign that the campaign is going *exactly* as planned
God   Wait for it   Damn
I had no idea this went beyond the vicious mockery! lol still thank you for the inspiration to write music.
This never gets old
I need a whole ass DND song with that FUCKEN bard!! 🤣 Me and my friends decided you're now the living embodiment of the archetypal Bard.
Something about “So I’m gonna bring it all myself” is real af when you’re the only spellcaster too lmao.
0:58 i need this as a ringtone 😅
I quote "my boys are otherwise engaged" to myself all the time. Like I be at work and it's getting busy and I'm all  "me and my boys (coworkers who do not share my fondness of them or our work) gonna mess you up (take and fulfill your orders so fast)"  "I rolled a one (need to restock something urgently brb)"  "I rolled a one (spilled something that needs to be mopped up asap)"  "FUCK"
Are you a Ben Lippen alum?
thanks for getting me through my homework lol
i have never played D&D before, and i am short; this song is awesome :D
The fact that he says "child" at the same time as the GM floors me  Also, the realization before "Don't."
The way he kind of looks like he’s having a flute seizure at the end and then “bitch” randomly comes out at the end killed me
A year later and I am still giggling like a lunatic every time I watch this! 🤣 Thank you for such a masterpiece! 😍❤️
"Let slow it all down a bit, so you notice that one of the hooded figures is a little shorter..." Instantly in his head : "Fuck him"
0:37 I can't stop hearing "so skibidi" pls help
“There’s no escapin it” “So skibidi”
This should be made into a short movie 🤣🤣🤣
This Was Fun to Watch 😁
0:45 will never not be funny
Laughed. So. Hard.
This is so amazing! i need more of this!
Not the dm being so excited to actually introduce them to the kid they were looking for 😭
How exactly does one play a flute while looting a dead kid's body?
The dnd songs are the best
This will remain the best dnd bard tune ever XD
The 'BITCH' at the end always gets me. 🤣
When you cast Vicious Mockery, the enemy rolls. If they got a Nat20 then theyve heard all the short jokes before and attack you
VICIOUS MOCKERY IS A SAVING THROW. YOU DON'T ROLL DICE WHEN CASTING VICIOUS MOCKERY. JEEEEEEEEEEEESUS. The rest was fire, but you kinda ruined it for me.
DM: so first of all, vicious mockery is a saving throw, not an attack roll...
This song enters my head whenever I play RPGs now. "Loot that body! Loot that body!"
"Don't"
I came here from Wizard Time.
You always loot the body right? 😂
Please do this song in Melbourne
I never could've imagined what this song could lead to, after today I'm astounded
This is seriously the best thing I've ever fucking seen.  I've watched, mostly while drunk, probably 1000 times.  Thank you for that.
Who else immediately watched this again after 'Love Letter to a Dungeon Master' 😂
i just realized that’s not a real flute
Why is this so real? 🤣
Can't believe this is the same guy that made Human Centipede gang 😂
This in me fr. Im a bard in a couple dnd campains. I have a lot of fun lol. 🎉
I thought he was saying “ that’s so skibidi” I hate myself
Half orc Barbarian, Rogue, players clearly making their own rules and not respecting the DM.   Guys, this is just the Dragon Friends
the song paused itself as soon as he said that the doctor said wait 💀
5 irl days and 15 in game days is the most backwards shit lmao.
''there is no escaping it''? nah, all i hear is ''so skibidy'' xD
My brother showed this to me as a way to convince me to play D&D with him   It worked.
And my 11 year old makes me play this one every single morning. You are now a family channel.
My cousin introduced me to BG3 recently, I chose bard and this was practically our whole experience
That was a very weird Critical Role episode
When the luckiest dice roller is also the most chaotic person in the group.
Best dnd song ever
I listen to this one at least once a month lol took me at least 4 plays before i noticed you were playing your drumstick as a flute 😂
Since when do you roll a d20 for vicious mockery? I thought it was 1d4?
It took me too long to realize that flute is really a drum stick
I laughed so hard I could barely breath the first time I saw this.  I can't say how many times I watched this now
the way he says SHORT while looking like he Gavin a panic attack got me dieing
Your average D&D campaign
me, spontaneously over 700 hours of BG3: 🎶loot that body (gotta loot that body now) loot that body (gotta loot that motherfucker)
I love this so much and the fact some big d&d youtubers have done animated shorts with the audio😂😂😂
SHORT!!!!
I love this song, it’s something else entirely to see it like this though. (I laughed non stop and my coke went into my nose XD)
I dont even play dnd and know nothing about it this fucks i love it
Omg I just realized that’s a drumstick not a flute. Rolled a 1 for perception myself I guess
“I rolled a 1” “I rolled a 1” “Fuck” *clap clap*
Why does theres no escaping it sounds like "So skibiddy"
"don't"
I rewatch this at least once a month- pure gold
0:38 why the fuck do i hear “so skibidi” instead of “there’s no escaping it” what the actual hell is wrong with me
I laugh out loud every time I watch this video... 1000x later still makes me die
instant sub
0:38 all i hear is him saying "so skibidi"😭
0:58
can I please find a man like that for marriage.
This entire time I thought he said “it’s so skibidi” and I’ve died every time. Just realized “it’s no escaping it”
The number of times I've watched this and I literally only just realized that he's miming the flute on a drumstick 🤣
Wait did I found the original video after going through so many animated ones 😂
Великолепно!)))
you know what i just noticed? the cloaked figures were never stated to have malicious intent, they could have been trying to safely escort the child to the party
There's one in every gaming group......
THE FLUTE SPIN WAS SO COOL
I might sing this to myself just about...everyday single day.
When the bard casts vicious mockery IS A GNOME and it's all the short jokes he's been hit with and he's unleashing it all.
This is surprisingly how majority of DnD sessions actually go...
"Loot that body!" sounds as equally lethal as the vicious mockery.
0:38 - Without the subtitles I would've *SWORN* he was saying "So Skibidi"
How many times have u watched this? Me: yes
Oh no! Tom found a flute!
When my friends and I went to a DND party, this was our theme song.
I'm short and my mind is shattered, can confirm the nat 20 is real
1:00 Short people just got completely destroyed (which I guess kinda includes me)
I clipped the I rolled a 1 bit for my D&D group as a soundboard button. It's just so perfect n_n
I like the implication that the mockery was so effective the kid ended up dying from it 😂
holy shit this is phenomenal
I just realized his flute is a drumstick.   I've watched this video probably 20 times and only just noticed.
I dead ass need a full animation for this song please😢
I hummed this song a month ago and my daughters insisted I tell them what the song is. I showed them this and now they are singing it non-stop... I can't wait for teacher-parent meeting...
This lives rent free in my head for the rest of my life!
What gets me about this is RAW, you would not roll for Vicious Mockery yourself since it is a save-or-suck spell, and thus the bard getting a nat 20 on that, much less even rolling the dice in that case to begin with, would only be achievable through a houserule or something. (Unless the kid rolled a 1 on their save, which would've likely yielded the same result)
Bard has alot of potential in a DnD campaign
Went straight into my "Best of Youtube" - Playlist xD
Bo Burnham 2.0.
Let's fucking go
the second he heard the word short he casted the mockery
The flute spin 😂
Genuinely thought "there's no escapin it" was "so skibidi"
As a 5’6” individual I have very confusing feelings towards this one.
Anyone else think "In Anticipation" would be an awesome name for a Rogue?
I have to admit that I've been going through a tough time in my life lately. This video has become an amazing mood booster, every time I hear it I have to laugh and it makes me feel better right away and it doesn't matter how bad the day started when it's this crazy and more videos like this
Ngl if he continued on the DND path it would be awesome, imagine listening to his songs while playing lol
I have watched this multiple times a week every week since it first dropped and I've only TODAY noticed that flute, is a drum stick.
A total genius.
This video is 'S' tier YouTube, I watch it on the regs and it always makes me laugh
Heard this remixed on another short today and went right back to watch this video; makes me laugh so hard every time😂
Best thing ever
how has it been a year already?
My League of Legends allchat for the last 15 years.
The best part for me is that Vicious Mockery is not even something he can roll for. Its the target that makes a save. 😅😅😅
I dont know much about dnd so im not sure if vicious mockery does damage but at no point does the dm say the child died, just that their mind was shattered. So they just loot this kid IN FRONT OF the other two people with them  I googled i and it does deal damage, but the image of the child still being alive was funnier
I can't even provide a rebuttal to this, that's just how bards are   People keep stereotyping us as the guy who seduces the dragon  But we're also the guy who finishes off the BBEG with an insulting one-liner
This song (0:59 - 1:21) I'm always using now in my streams as sound alert for taunting a bird friend of mine, calling him "small" xD
Cheese knees is glorious (look in the video background for context)
i cant be the only person that heard "Me and my boys are gonna rizz you up" right?
His body's just lying there right?   Right?
Only 6.1 M?!?!?! drastically underrated
1:00 uff reference smg3 hahaha i love
I want someone to do a Harry Potter animatic of the "you're a short m***********r and nobody likes you" but, but it's Sirius talking to Snape.
I still need 2 more minutes
I must say this... Vicious Mockery is wisdom savingthrow... it can't crit... ☝️🤓
Am I crazy,  or is this track slightly faster  on this glorious record?
At least he's more helpful than 3 Kobolds in a Trench Coat
0:37 does anyone else hear "so skibidi" instead of "there's no escaping it"?
You probably failed the perception check and didnt notice that tom is playing a drumstick instead of a flute
For some reason when he says "There's no escaping it" I keep hearing "It's so skibidi"  I hate that the world has done this to me!!!!!!
“SHORT!!”
Defo has a mighty boosh feel to it
The engaged lean forward of the DM as they say “So you notice one of the figures is a little shorter” is so tragically sincere
"ME AND MY BOYS GONNA RIZZ YOU UP" "SO SKIBIDI"
A perfect @DavidLightbringer Deep Ones theme song.
When your Vicious Mockery takes three rounds to cast you know it's going to cause some real damage.
This needs to be a mod that can be played in bg3!! Like now lol
Twitter warriors be like 0:58
One time we did actually roll three nat 1’s in a row in my campaign. Always think of this song… we also made a “loot that body” sound clip. We play it a lot 🤣
So nice to see the actual video after seeing the Dark Urge version. Hilarious 😂
Zub fucking loves you!!  Everyone at the party fell in love with your song dude!! POG CHAMP!
0:58
😢
I paled dnd 1 and then i rolled  a Nat 20 for wanting  to make Cheese sauce wall shouting racial slurs and then chug the cheese      sauce and then say mmmm cheese sauce then pore half of the cheese sauce on a giant bone dragon it  was the boss Batel
A Destiny animation with the rouge being the hinter, a titan being the barbarian  and  the bard being a warlock would be fire.
I'm late. Really, I'm too late comment this, but here's why : it's the first time i'm breathing after toooooo much laughing because of this video I watched... a bit more than one year ago
why is this the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life?
Whos gonna tell him that Vicious Mockery is a save check?
I remember u had another dnd song about 2 dms, where it is now? I can't find it
Spotify wrapped told  my my favourite genre was parody nerd-core. I blame this
Bro said short with such force, that's what killed him 1:03
Beautiful, Excuisite, Amazing. I need 20hr version of this.
Fun fact: The chance of him rolling 3 nat 20s in a row is 0,0125% or 1/8000.
I truly love the backround storytelling. The 😑 when he rolls the first nat 20, despite that the typical dm would be excited that a player xan get more information about important story events (especially because he's clearly excited to explain that one of the figures in shorter), the "Its always a kid", the 😒 "dont".  Tom does shit like this CONSTANTLY and still manages to have enough irl bard charisma that the other players just start rolling and getting swept up in whatever nonsense he's doing
It's a funny bit but legit hate players like this.
This is peak comedy. 😂
The fact that I know which person would be which in my friend group is sad and hilarious all at once.
Best Song, best video clip and best YT comment section EVER...
This song is the reason I run bard now
The whole song is pure gold🎉❤ I will never not laugh at this 😂
0:38 legit thought he said "so skibidi"
0:38 Skibidi?
I love how the DM was gonna give him all the info they needed to complete the quest due to the nat 20 check, but he cut him off before he could say anything
I LOVE THIS!!! XDD VICIOUS MOCKERY!!!
I love how he just decides to cast a vicious mockery on the slightly shorter cloaked figure instead of checking if they are an adult or not
"You notice one of the cloaked figures is SHORTER than the others..." The DM hopes that the quest for the missing child is finally over...  But his bard is just a little too thirsty for blood today.
I think this is the most, geunly, great song that I know about role playing
the "Loot that MADAFAKAAAAA" will permanently ingrained in my brain
I'll never be able to play a bard normaly again
This gets all the funnier when you realize that Vicious Mockery calls for a Charisma save, not an attack roll.
1:23 It is only now after many times watching the animation and getting a chance to watch this original where i see he actually says “child” at the same time as the dm. Truly demonstrating that “it’s always a child” has happened enough times to where the DM has given similar narration. Yet he never learns that his actions have consequences 💀
I lost it when I heard ‘you’re a short mutha f#### and nobody likes you’ 😂
Okay, I have to get it off my chest. I been calling you Tom Candy FOR YEARS because my vision apparently has gotten worse  and only now I realized it's Tom CARDY. I've been telling all my friends to listen to Tom Candy... I fucking swear I always seen Tom Candy.....
And now he's the emcee for the Critical Role live shows in Australia, woooooooooo
Man, I wish I had the creativity for D&D.
Oh my fucking fuck ahahahahahahahahahahaha😂
I saw this but with a Hololive edit and yeah it's something Ollie would do.
I know this is a long shot to see an answer but you're wearing a shirt from a jesus school for kids from a city im from and I'm so intrigued how you came upon the Ben Lippen Falcons shirt
Yup, it pretty much sums up all my D&D campaigns.
I only just realised that Tom must have been taught the flute by the same guy who taught Ray Parker Jr the trumpet, what a coincidence.
1:03 the absolute viciousness in how he says "short"
I think 1.2 million of these views are just me
Wait, it's DnD4 bard, since he make an attack roll, and vicious mockery is a save roll for opponent in all DnD version except DnD4 where it is an attack... Great!
DM: Roll save at disadvantage. Bard: Wait, what? DM: You just went, killed a kid and waltzed between the two people guarding it to loot the body. Your character is obviously too preoccupied patting down the kid he just killed to notice the axe closing in on your neck. Roll save at disadvantage.
Even with the massive and amazing animations/animatics/etc, the original holds up still.
Tom Cardy being the MC for a Crit Role live show is divine fate!
0:38 I'm not the only who hears "so skibidi" there right? It's not just the brainrot, right??
Anytime someone says "short" or "loot" this song immediately pops into my head. Tom Cardy, you owe me rent.
I wonder if Tom the Vampire got good at playing Flute specifically because he got called out for playing the Drumstick?
This is my current phone ringtone
My wife sings this song at the top of her lungs EVERY FU@$ING DAY. Do you have any other songs like this so she can sing something else?
Best Song Ever !! Never tire of it.
1:21 I like how Tom knew the answer was going to be "child" before the DM even finished talking.
I wish I could just like this more.
The amount of times I've rewatched this is ridiculous.
I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love this, take my like and my comment funny man
He said avengers ass and we know that Chris evan has americas ass
Please tell me you bring a flute when you play dnd?
A lot of people have commented about how Tom's character has apparently killed multiple children, but has anyone remarked how foolish the NPC who hired him to find a child must be?
"I can perceive you 👁👄👁🫵"
This one song went on to create three separate memes based on the Nat 1 Roll Teammates, Casting Vicious Mockery, and Looting Bodies. Truly impressive.
“so skibidi” “me and the boys gonna rizz u up”
we need more like this lol  alot more lol  like a full 10 page long lol  it so funny
I'd like to learn how to twirl things in my fingers, cause it looks cool af.
He’s not supposed to roll an attack for a vicious mockery, vicious mockery requires a save from the one being attacked so this video is wrong!!!!!
what kind of flute is used in this song?
it's a gem💎
PLEASE, I BEG YOU, make another nerd song
1:31 My favroute part! :D
0:39 it sounds like “so skibidi” 0:45 it sounds like “rizz you up”
It's so good.
DnD sucks now because I just want every game to be this song.
1:03 SHORT
The vocal crunch ar the me and my boys  gonna mess you up scratchest my brain just the right way
Every part of this is pure gold!
0:38 he sounds like he says “theres no skibidi”💀💀💀
Okay, so the animated video is great, but this video is GOLD. It's so good I'm actually a little bit disgusted.
Didn’t realize this was the guy that made ‘red flags’ for a hot minute lmfao 💀
🎵 YOU'RE SHORT MOTHERFUCKER  AND NOBODY LIKES YOU 🎵 1:00
I have watched this so many times it is his best song ever
The fact that BITCH is my bards vicious mockery every time made this so good at the end 😂
1:04 = "SHORT!"
Omg the original is even better LMAO   Edit: K, working out with this song is just phenomenal 😂 (sadly I start laughing mid set, which is not good but totally worth it)
Nat 20 Let's Fucking Go!
1:40 Me after I take out enemies in Baldur's Gate 3
I can't help imagine Gricko from Ledgends of Avantris singing this. 😂
0:38 all i hear here is so skidibi, my brain is so fried
I can't like this enuff!
Tom Cardy is a absolute treasure to humanity
The irony of the fact that Viscous Mockery doesnt even require a roll to cast, butbrather one to resist 😭
tell me your not julian barrattt
1:00 TCNick3 whenever he fights Vernais
this is just legendary
0:38 For some reason i thought he said "We're so Skibidi"
There is no way he is actually saying "There is so escaping it" it sounds so much like "So skibidi"
At 1:10 - "that you were just a head" I love the subtle electronic robotic backing vocal on this line. Maximum levels of funky.
that vicious mockery was... really vicious.
this has been making me happy for the past week
"It's always a kid" HOW MANY TIMES HAS THIS HAPPENED 😂
I hate that I can only like this once 😭
0:39 my brain might be fucked. But all i hear is "so skibidi" and reading what it says doesnt help 😭
Let me get this straight.... So they verbally assaulted the child with body shaming to the point it died, and looted the corpse of said child?
SHORT!?
Why can't i stop watching this video?
THIS IS HILARIOUS
SHORT!
Love the nonchalance of the last nat 20. There was no question what was coming 😆
You just simply understand....
You enjoyed making this
THIS IS JUST TOO GOOD
I... Can't stop watching it. 🤦🏻‍♀️
I can never watch this just once
This is still one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. I come back to this on bad days and it definitely helps
This is why we always have a cleric on hand to deal with these situations lmao
Chaotic Neutral bards are such a joy to have around my table.
Is everyone gonna ignore the fact that the white board behind him says cheese knees
Imagine being one of the cloaked figures in this scenario. You're traveling through the forest and come upon a trio of adventurers. Two of them immediately trip over their own feet, and the third yells at your companion hard enough to kill him.
This song reminds me of the DND game I sat in on. By the end, a child tabaxi priestess-in-training was dead, one of the characters was having a mental breakdown (due to them killing the child), Jessidah the innkeeper was STILL kidnapped due to intimidation by a rude goblin doctor, and the warlock/rogue unlocked fireball. I pray for their remaining sanity.
Can we take a moment to appreciate how *well mixed* this song is? The panning of the doubled (and tripled) voices, the talkbox/vocoder... This is an absolute masterclass in sound mixing (and hilarious). If you haven't yet, listen to this with headphones.
That aggressive "Loot that Mothafuckaaaaa!" at the end!🤣🤣🤣
Wow. This is The Mighty Boosh worthy. Haha. 😄
Maaaaan now i have to learn to play a flute.
I keep thinking: oh that's a cute tiny flute. OH, actually a drum stick, nvm.
I like this better than the animated one
Yknow what? I get the casting for Mammon now.
This never stops being hilarious
Why does this feel like it was filmed in the late 80s. lmao
I can’t stop hearing “There’s no escaping it” as “so skibidi” 😂
Can someone explain to me why the kid died from a vicious mockery?
what kind of flute is this? (other than just being a drumstick in the video)
I love how the bard doesn't need the GM to end his sentence to realize he just roasted a child to death.
Now, THAT is why I pay my electricity bills.
0:59
I did not see the "loot that body" bit coming...... at all
I'Ve been laughing for the past ten minutes.... I can barely freaking breathe..... This is awesome, and why is this so true to like ninety percent of every DND party i've ever been in 😂😂
“It’s always a kid”
Something which I haven't seen anyone else mention (from my brief glance at the comments) is that when the DM says "child" at around 1:25, you can also see the bard player saying it at the same time.
I have never been more in love with someone I've never met 😅
Kid witnessed two healthy trained adults die in front of him spontaneously, got viewed ultra hard by the only person still alive from the group, then got killed by a roast from the same person somehow unaffected by his buddies' death.
The anger when you play is hilarious
Pls tell me you ar working on an extended version... Because this is a treasure...🤩
1:05 :3
Well, it looks like I have found a new soundtrack for our play (previously we used mostly "Yakety sax").
God, I die every single time at "Loot that mothafuckaaaaa!"
that short shout feels really personal at 1:04
This song is terribly catchy and i love it
"i'm sorry ... i'll be better"  we all know he is *not* sorry and he will *not* be better
I'm downloading this and adding it to my car playlist.
the title made me think this was a Disco Elysium meme
"Perception Check" has become my "Vibe Check" for D&D groups
Thought this thumbnail was just a Begbie scene from Trainspotting
I know it was a mistake to watch the Lalafell version first because now I can't get it out of my head.
For anyone thinking about him rolling a Nat 20 for Vicious Mockery, consider: The player was so impatient and cocky that he just rolled it anyway assuming it was like any other attack, without giving the DM a chance to correct him
No matter what this is a CLASSIC
0:38 "There's no escaping it" I heard this as "so skibidi" and you know what? I think it works just as well, so I'm rollin with it
This song furthers the stereotype that in DnD content in online media, a d20 has only two sides: 20 - the fabric of spacetime shifts beneath your fingers, as you perform the most epic action in the history of the known universe 1 - you don't do the action
This is Genius  He Rolled a nat 20 while making this Song
"Ugh look at that guy he's so short and fragile. Gross"  "Dude that's your baby son"
gosh damn you're sexy
You should check flounderman man user fan animathion of this song, it's amazing
I suppose I have to be the one to bring up the fact that Vicious Mockery uses a Wisdom Save and not an Attack Roll. A nat 20 would be a success on their part.
You know youve got Matt on the brain when you think Vicious Mockery is a saving throw you dont roll for it- and immediately thing about CR thinking they need to roll for scry
The player who plays the bard is *incredibly* uncreative. So we made a table of insults *i* made, i use a deck of cards to choose them.
This is amazing
Any moment I’m in trouble 0:46
(SO SKIBIDI!) [..."there's not escaping it"]
Got Baldurs Gate, and chose a bard with a flute cause of this song.
I've watched this like ten times and only just realized that vicious mockery is a saving throw, you CAN'T roll a nat 20
THAT "BITCH" AT THE END ALWAYS GETS MEEEEEEEE
vicious mockery is a saving throw not roll to hit so.. he just insulted them so bad that despite rolling a 20 it obliterated them.
Had a moment like the end of this, where a guy my party was chasing was shot dead by an unknown marksman, and one of my players thought that instead of breaking line of sight, he should loot the corpse. Long story short he was hit for 23 piercing damage, like a dumbass.
Thank you for this! I wish there was an extended version or a second part to this. :)
Loot that body 😂
I keep on thinking he is saying "so skibidi"
so skibidi
<3
Very Chromeo - Bad Decision and I’m fully here for it. When’s it out on iTunes?
i know this is comedy and all that but the flute riffs are actually insanely technical and i love it BITCH
At one game I rolled 20 4 times and gm canceled game 😅
"DM Tom" perfectly expresses how every DM feels dealing with the "Bard Tom" type player.
You have my sword, and my staff, and my bunny bracelet
OMG THIS IS SO GOOOD HAHAHAHA
To be fair this in part, if not mostly, the GMs fault. He had created a game where upon seeing anybody the players feel they're under attack.  The barbarian grabbed their weapon to attack but critical failed.  The rogue tried to hide but crit failed.  Of course the bard was going to kill them on site
The lyric "there no escaping it" Sounds like "so skibbidy" to me. 😂
one shot brought me here
0:46   Fuck.
Make a longer version this is too fucking good
I've played DND, and I know the references here, so I'm just laughing my ass off and crying because I've thought about making my character a Bard the next time I try and play 😂 Not to mention after hearing this meme all across the Internet for years and finally listening to the song through Spotify and then finding this video I can guarantee that all the fame was absolutely worth it because this is gold content!
This is by far your best one Tom.  Ive watched this more than I am willing to admit
so i heard "there's no escaping it" as "it's so skibbidi". my brain is rotting.
This kinda of stuff is the reason why I would love to get into dnd Ive never played it before but would love to seems fun as fuck
1:04 SHORT
When he says "there's no escaping it" and "are gonna mess you up." I heard "so skibidi" and "are gonna Rizz you up".
amazing
This brings back memories of a certain foul-mouthed gnome bard.
0:37 I seriously thought he said so skibidi- the brainrot is getting to my head you guys
Dm: You just killed a child  Bard: ...I call dibs on his shoes Wizard: I'll have his Cloak Barbarian: I WANT HIS TEETH
this is a master peace
This is the quality content i come to youtube for. Subscribed.
" I cast Vicious Mockery NAT 20 LET'S GO!" and the realisation in his eyes when he says "don't"  why am i incontrolably laughing at this every single time? 😂
Why does the “there’s no escaping it” sound like “that’s so slibbidi”
I know he says "theres no escaping it", but I swear it sounds like he says so skibbidi
0:36 Corgi hair / Ernie cameo 🤣🤣
0:38 I keep hearing "so skibidi" do I have a brainrot
To be fair, the DM should’ve said that it was the child they were looking for when he had his first nat 20 perception check
I love the glasses version of him looks genuinely confused.
It's the only one guy who gets 20 everytime, but did not even think things through.
This is a moment of game culture history.
Vote to make this the Murderhobo anthem, anyone? 😂
I really want someone to make a choreographed dance for this.
Everyone talking about how Vicious Mockery is a save and not an attack roll, while completely ignoring the orc critically failed a roll to ready their warhammer, which isn't a dice roll of any kind.
1:40 "loot thatbody!!!!" Lmao had me in tears 🤣🤣🤣😭. Bro didnt even hesitate 😭 😂.
0:40 i feel like some1 got here from this clip
okay, that music are awsome but... plz someone can tell me what kind of flute was use for this song ? (yeah i know that was sinthetised but i want to play an instrument with aggressivity just like in this song)
I love how you can tell the bard was saving that song in his arsenal of weapons.😂😂😂
Truly the greatest bard of our age. Not the hero we needed but certainly the hero we wanted.
"...Yes?....*click* Don't-"
The face he makes when he says "muthafukaaa" CRACKS... ME... UP.
I goddamn love that flute riff right before the "SHORT!"
"Its always a kid" Implies this isnt the first time this has happned.
I've listened to this at least 30 times in the last two days and I can't stop laughing.
I don't know how many times I've watched "Perception Check" by Tom Cardy so far, but it it many, and it's still funny and makes me want to sing and dance every time. I don't see this changing anytime soon, and I'm going to continue watching this entertainment gold for many times to come. This is my favorite of his work.
I woke up feeling like crap this morning and my teenage daughter played this for me... suddenly I felt ready for anything. Bonus action, bardic inspiration
You don't roll fort Vicious Mockery, it's a Wisdom saving throw for the target.
Does anyone else hear, 'so skibidi' instead of 'theres no escaping it'?
Spoiler: Tom was using loaded dice, which explains how he got 3 Nat 20s in a row.  He was playing to agressively so noone would question that
Okay so my friends and I are planning on playing a run of baldurs gate 3 as the party in this song (half-orc barbarian, halfling/dwarf/gnome rogue, human bard) because we like it so much
The absolute disdain when he says "SHORT!" abruptly is just amazing. Like his shortness is causing a physical uncontrollable outburst seeded only in rage. It's beautiful.
The best part is the singing honestly
SEND HELP I CAN'T STOP LISTENING
Nothing has made me laugh more this year 😂😂😂😂
1:03 SHORT!!!
My brain rot has peaked. When we says "There's no escaping it", I legitimately heard "So skibidi", and now I want to kill myself.
Buddy: The worst she can say is no  Her:
I think this is my favorite song 😂
1:40 don't mind be just leaving this timestamp here
this player sounds so very annoying to play with
Is anyone else annoyed because he rolled for a hit on vicious mockery even though it's a saving throw?
The best thing about this is that he says "is always a kid".... like this kind of thing happens all the time where he impatiently attacks a group and is constantly accidentally killing kids
Hey, if I see a body, I gotta loot it 😂
That "bitch" was personal
Should probably have a look at that man's dice   Nat 20 deception..... dice seem fine to me
I love how complex and layered the music is for your songs, you go hard even for the silliest idea and I love it 😂🥰
Wait but how is he able to loot that body when...there is that other figure
SHORT
I must have watched this video easily 30 times now, i know all the words (speaking and singing) by heart and i still cannot stop howling with laughter.  Tom if you read this - you're a bloody genius mate!
That’s AdHa mind right there 😂😂😂
IS  IS THAT THE BALDURS GATE DICE
I've listened to at 56 times already and it still feels like the first time. This song rolled a D20 on my brain's primary auditory cortex, located in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe. But I'm cool with it 😎
I've watched this video a lot. I've just realised his flute is a drumstick.
Brilliant, just so funny and entertaining man :) I Love it.
I can't get over the fucking impeccable rhythm. The only better part is the absolutely VICIOUS mockery. "Stops you from forming meaningful relationships" is such a wonderful line, and I'm in awe of the wordsmithery.
I have listened to and watched this a zillion times and only just noticed the whiteboard in the background says Cheese Knees lol
You sir, are a treasure!
😂😂👏
i keep hearing "There's no escaping it" as "So skibidi". Can someone cast remove curse on me?
The absolute look of feral chaos in this man’s eyes when he snaps to attention and says “I cast Vicious Mockery” is the epitome of awoke-and-chose-violence energy and I love it. 🤣🤣🤣 0:58
Me failing to hold back the "Um, actually" guy in me: ...BUT VICIOUS MOCKERY PROVOKES A SAVE, NOT AN ATTACK ROLL AND YOU CAN'T CRIT ON IT!
Play this at my funeral
SHORT!!
I love how the bard realizes just before the DM tells him that it was a child, and then remarks that it’s “always” a child.
Everyone send this to Ben Shapiro with the 1:00 timestamp link
"But... you don't even roll for vicious mockery... ?" "Actually, I replaced all saving throws with making a spell attack against a DC calculated from the monster's saving throws, so that my players get to roll attacks for their spells and we don't have to roll for every single monster affected by a fireball." "You know what? That's actually a good idea."
Vicious mockery
The little aggressive mini bursts of flute solo absolutely make this.
Least insane Bard gameplay:
i actually had something like this happen to me. a couple years ago i was talking to an online friend when the conversation shifted to height for some reason. i told her my height, which was 4'11 at the time  she asked me if an anvil fell on my head 💀
8 months later, still cracks me the fuck up.  That "Yes...DON'T." and the expression along with it is fucking Oscar worthy.
"LOOT THAT BODY" (YES) "GOTTA LOOT THAT MUTHA7AKA" (HELL YES)
So this is the full version…that really escalated
I need this on Spotify 😢
I finally found the original video.  Nice song btw.
Hail yea! Ima play this when my neighbor asks fer a ride to town again. Short muthafuqua gonna hear this whole video on repeat.
Lol I love this
🎶 When you were born everybody thought that you were just a head but then the doctor said ‘wait! This stupid mutherfucking tiny, short ass baby got a tiny little itty bitty body and I hate it.’ 🎶
Ya know i just realized there are still 2 other people? So like is he looting and everyones in utter shock? What happened to the other 2
Can I just say: it’s Nat 20s. He didn’t spec his build to always get 20s, he just got insanely lucky at the worst possible times.
Thats me when my GF DM for me 😂
bard was quicker into action than the battle ready barbarian lol
📣SHORT📣
legendary
masterpiece
is it possible to find out which wind instrument is used and what kind of model it is?
I quote this far too often.
It took me entirely too long to realize he was blowing into a drum stick....He is that musically talented that I believed he was playing a flute. 😅 He perceived me for sure lol
Bro the little dance he does while singing "Loot that body" fuggin kills me. Tom is an absolute legend lmao
no joke i think about thiss song every day
pure masterpiece
I have been watching this short off and on for about a month now and still laugh my ass off every time.  "Me and the boys are gonna mess you up! I rolled a one. I rolled a one. Fuck!"  Hilarious & thanks.
This is. . .  This is the best thing I've ever seen 🤣  If you actually did this in game, I'd demand that you have permanent inspiration lol
That song is so vicious and vile.     I love it.
This might be my favorite internet, of all the internets.
1:32
want me to ruin this for you?...at first in 0:38 i heard "It´s so skibidi" now i can´t unhear it..and neither can you,you´re welcome
Vicious mocker is a save. Not d20 roll from the player. 😢
This is the kind of efficient bard that everyone should be afraid of.
something i noticed is that the whole party was gearing up for shenanigannery with the hooded figures, it just so happens that the other two members of the rag-tag trio crit failed so the dm’s anger went directly towards the bard lmao
Tom is a high level bard, with the ability to get and earworm like this stuck in your head for 2d6 months, and I crit failed my save.
Well this just made my day.   Good show
Totally my husband's halfling bard...he named him Guy.
I will never stop laughing at this. "Loot that Body".😂
1:00 Anyone come here from SMG4?
I made my first bard yesterday and absolutely chose vicious mockery. No question
DM: Tom, what does your human Bard do? TC: Active Perception Check, *rolls* nat 20 let’s go TC: *30 seconds of fuckery before even asking what the fuck he sees*
Amazing This crew of 1 or 20 rollers should become a weekly thing. This Bard is just too funny and talented
God, I wish this song was on Apple Music or Spotify
I don't even play these sorts of games yet I think this is so funny!
SHORT! hahahahahha
This is pure comedy
PLEASE. Do. MORE!!!!!!!
Damn, now I need a flute when I loot
Can you make an extended version, I love this song lol
"His body's just lying there, right?" "..." "Right?" "... Yes. Don't!" "LOOT THAT BODY!"
My entire run of bg3
I can't express how much joy this songs brings me.
I've had the animated version in my music playlist since it released and only now do I realize he's saying "there's no escaping it" and not "so skibidi"
how the fuck can a drumstick sound so REAL?! WTF, it fooled me so good! IT SITLL DOES HELP
You should write the sequel to Hamilton.  Hamilton II, Electric Boogaloo The Hamiltoning
It's a masterpiece.
This music is amazing
Okay but what are Cheese Knees?
" no escaping it", but I'm hearing "so skippity" ?
I am a big fan of the drumstick flute.
I can't stop hearing "there's no escaping it" at 0:38 as "you're so skibbidi" and I hate myself
https://youtu.be/6P7fHpEg0Tk?si=9QaUkZoja2tZuLGv
This made me laugh so dayum hard!
"It's always a kid" - how many kids did you roast to death xD
The fact this song is only 2 minutes is criminal.
How much do you want to bet this guy almost never hits an actual boss and only has god-like rolls when it either doesn't matter or actively hurts the parties effort.
i didnt realize until i read the lyrics that it does not in fact say "so skibbidi" but rather "theres no escaping it" and now i cant stop giggling
I want an animated version of this song that uses the scribes from Inscryption. which players would each scribe be? I think PO3 would be the DM and Leshy would be the bard, while Grimora would be the rouge and Magnificus would be the half-orc barbarian.
I listen to this once every couple of days. It recharges me.
i need like 50 more verses to this
I love this song with all my heart and soul..... but am I the only one who's twitching that the words weren't "TOOTIN' my flute when I loot"?  IT WAS RIGHT THERE!!!!!
I'm not really a DND fan, I don't really have much interest in it. However, this song.. this song is what reaches out to make it hilariously worth while.
😂😂😂❤❤😂😂😂😂 Give Us More!!! I wanna hear more about the bard and his dice rolling skills!! 🤣🤣🤣
Why is Tom's music so kick ass?
That flute twirl, those dance moves. Hes just lovin it and so am I 😂
What did we learn? Gods fall and empires crumble to the power of NAT 20 "emotional damage" Vicious Mockery.
I've watched this video more times than I can count, and only now I've noticed that that's not a flute.  It's a drum stick.
Ru gonna punch her dad’s dick again ?
Someone please do this with invincible's Thragg and Oliver, I can picture it now, invincible's director : you roll a nat 20 in perception and you find out the  person was so short because they were a child!!!!, not only that, but they were one of the children of the last heirs of emperor argol, you know, the lineage you been looking for, for the 1200 universe years and 12 youngling viltamite years, Thragg : oh ya, well f@#$, now I feel bad, I promise I'll do better, by the way, were sure the kid is either unconscious or dead right ( looks with menacing grin ) invincible's director : yes??!!. Don't, Thragg : " loot that body, loot that body now, let's loot that body, lootthatmotherf@#$_&, I'll play a song as I loot that dead kids body ( play's sick solo ) b@#$_.
It took my so many rewatches to realize that the other group had done absolutely nothing threatening.
THREE of my players from TWO different groups have, COMPLETELY INDEPENDANTLY FROM EACH OTHER, sent me this video to clown on their short DM
Very funny. I just wished he used Vicious Mockery correctly in it.
THE FACT IT WAS A CHILD JUST THREW ME OFF GUARD SO HARD
"LOOT THAT BODY!"  -Words every dnd player lives by XD
I mean, he's giving Bard a hard time, but Barbarian was about to maul and Rogue to pull a Vax'Ildan, were it not for the nat 1s.
The “bitch!” at the end killed me lmao
I love this song despite the fact that the guy rilled for vicious mockery a spell that requires a save check from the inflicted target not a spell attack roll
I'm absolutely obsessed with the gesture he makes when he says "I can perceive you"
"it's always a kid :/" HOW MANY TIMES HAS THIS HAPPENED--AND WHEN WILL THEY LEARN!?!?
The DM's face is so full of excitement when he mentions the short figure like "oh Tom's about to figure out that this is the Child" and then he just... doesn't 😂
Funniest shit I've seen on YouTube 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loot that body 😂😂😂
Alastor seeing Lucifer for the first time OH MY F%CKING GOD THERE A VERSION OF THIS THATS JUST LUCIFER
Growing up is discovering tom cardy was behind some of you favourite animations all along
It’s the hand gestures when he says ‘I can perceive you’ that get me the most 😂😂
This is pure gold, I can't stop playing this song on a repeat
I will always love the absolute ridiculousness of this video😂😂😂
*toot*
1:00
Are there any other songs like this?
throwback to our last dnd session when we had to do a perception check and 4 out of the 5 people in our group rolled a nat 1 and the other one an 18
This is giving Flight of the Concords and I love it.
I roll a 1 (I roll a 1)  Fuck! 😂😂😂
The sync of the bard and the DM on the word "child" is a great part of a great song.
I want a longer version of this song loosely based on a bard carrying an entire team through a campaign
average bard behaviour
I have it on my playlist I have it on my phone This mothafuckin song is fire And I've got to know So come on, tell me now  You picked the right jam So how's a fan gonna su- -pport you? You deserve payment I wanna fund you Yeah, here's what I wanna do:  Me and my friends wanna send you bucks (No payday yet.) (No payday yet.) ...FUCK  My friends are otherwise unpaid, so I'm gonna fund you by myself, HEY!   Seriously, do you have a Patreon or donation link or something where fans can send cash? I haven't had a chance to hunt for one yet, figured I could ask. Thanks for sharing your talent!
Is that a runco
I can imagine this happening to mineta from MHA
Every time he plays the “flute” I think of that one scene from Turning Red.
I liked this video, but just cautiously.......
Pure gold 🤣
0:22 1:03
Блеан, шедевр!/Deaaaaammm this is a masterpiece!
Celestia: You notice that one of the hooded figures is a little shorter, a- Discord: I cast VICIOUS MOCKERY, NAT 20, LET’S GO. (Discord, Nightmare Moon, Christine, KARR, Luna, Celestia, and Chrysalis proceed to slander Spike’s ass six ways to Sunday, ending with Discord throwing Spike out a window.)
Pd
This is what I would do if I played d&d
does anyone else think he looks a little bit like Marv from Home Alone? 😭😂
Tom Cardy Running Weighted Dice, and gave his Allies "Unlucky Die"
The fact that it abruptly ends makes me replay this endlessly. Just can't get enough of that sick flute playing.
This song shaped the campaign I'm DMing. All player changed for the....I want to say worst but it's a lot of fun xD
LOve this video!
Accurate.
I rolled a 1 I rolled a 1 FUCK
Ah yes, the true bard experience
I love this but I also have to know, what kind of flute is that? :o
I cast vicious mockery nat 20 lets go, youre a short mother fucker, and nobody likes you! (Plays flute) SHORT! Everybody says "look how fucking short that guy is" and it stops you from forming meaningful relationships! When you were born everybody thought you were just a head, but then the doctor said "Wait! This stupid mother fucker tiny short ass baby got a tiny little itty-bitty body and i HATE it!" 0:59
0:38 Oh my gods I thought that said "so skibidi." I feel quite dumb.
“Yes”  *recognition* *resigned disappointment*  “Don’t-“  Gets me every time
"Gotta loot the madafaka!" with that high-pitched prepubescent screach is the funniest part for me honestly.
I can't be the only one who is so brain broken that ehen he sings "there is no escaping it" it sounds likd he sings "so skibidi", right? RIGHT???
0:33
Art.
Why did I just hear about this song?! This is a MASTERPIECE.
i can see the song as actually being used in a combat, thought i'd put it as 3 rounds of continuous vicious mockery
“It’s always a kid” which implies that this wasn’t the first time this happened
My new dream is to see a collabo between Tom and Tenacious D. A full song between these two insane minds, and performers would probably shatter all our minds, but is worth risking.
Please help. I am old, and the practice of streaming is new and strange to me. Where can I buy this song by exchanging money for a downloadable file?
The instrumental sounds like an advertisement to a refreshing drink lol
I DM and my groups bard sent me this video. Not sure how I feel.
I swear, he said 'so skibidi'
As a staunch bard main I greatly appreciate the realism of "HOSTILE NPC SPOTTED ENGAGE VICIOUS MOCKERY"
0:38   "so skibidi"
Just finished Baldur's Gate 3 and I feel this in my soul.
i kept hearing "its so skibity" at 0:38 in reference to the ever influential "Skibity Toilet" series. truly a time to be alive.
my mood improve each way that i hear this song :D
loot that body
I really want an extended version of this, just too good to be this short 🤣
2 things about this are that if that rogue is level 11 or above, they still would've gotten like a 23 on that stealth check anyway, and you dont roll to hit with vicious mockery, the enemy has to make a wisdom save.
Big Astarion energy.
am I married as hell? yes. do I need to know tom cardy biblically? also yes
@Andre:can you tell me the notes of the flute? I want to use that whenever I roll 20 as a bard, please ^~^
Great song, had to come listen to it again after seeing you in dance till you stop.
I like how immediately mocks the character for being short when in DnD there are a bunch of races that are just short
" i rolled one" "i rolled one"  "f*ck :D"
This song lives rent free in my head, we need a full album.
The true, the only, the final... Murderhobo Anthem.
This is solid gold. GIVE ME MORE
has anyone else mentioned how vicious mockery is a saving throw not an attack?
That realization and "don't" is just so on point.
Why is this every D&D party I've ever been a part of?
I really feel the moment where the bard asks "the kid is just lying there, right?" And the gm is compleatly stunned and does not know why he is asking this question and than comes the realization. xD
my brain perceives it as “ so scibbidi” please send help
I didn't think I could could top 'mixed messages' or 'red flags' but now I hear this. Here's hoping for more hilarious dnd related songs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I will now constantly remember this incase a giant Wyvern comes to attack me just like my last campaign (my stats were perm halved because I broke my oath)
0:38 we all agree they are saying "so skibidi" right???
Now I wanna play dnd...
I like the reason the dm talks about height was to clue in that its the child but bards got to do what a bard gots to do
Loot it and revivify it
«It’s always a kid..» How many kids have perished to this madman?
why does the flute go so hard though, such a banger song
Wish it didnt end
"I rolled a 1." "I rolled a 1." "FUCK!" *Aggressive flute note*  best part of the song
i've watched this video approximately 742 times over the past five months, but today i watched it at my desk with my nice headphones for the first time and now have a whole other level of appreciation for it. thank you tom
you said vicious mockery not vicious death XD imagen this was a real DND game that would mean this man had been waiting to do this for so long
I rolled a one. I rolled a one. This song is superb.
As a short person, should I be staying away from Tom Cardy, or will he explode my head off with insults?
He's just describing the quintessential Bard experience
why is this song so catchy lol i swear ive had this on a loop 1000 times already
Rewatching this in preparation to play my flamboyant, impulsive Kenku bard 🐦‍⬛🎻
CHeese KNees
This song lives rent free in my head even MONTHS later and I love it lol #BardLife #BardGoals
1:00 Women on Tinder when your height starts with a 5
Actual footage of Edward Elric's demise
Ok. I cannot snap my fingers. I am seventeen. Not super weird, just pretty annoying for me. Even if I do the motion perfectly it makes no sound. BUT FOR SOME REASON I managed to do it right after "I feel it in my fingers" PERFECTLY TIMED haven't been able to do it since
Doot doot magic flute
this is bout to make me to get into D&D
We need an extended version of this!
Lucifer the Short King
It's giving Alastor the Radio Demon
I love the implication that Tom's character has such an active vendetta against short people that he regularly murders every short person they come across with Vicious Mockery and it's always just a kid.
This is and isn't the best thing to have on repeat in your head all day every day. Just resist the urge to sing it in public.
S H O R T
Ah remind me of that time i got a nat 20 on an inflict wound on a child, fun memories.
_"I rolled a 1."_  _"I rolled a 1."_  *_"Fuck."_*
Bro what the hell lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The loot part is me every time too in and rpg or dnd
This is some gourmet Mighty Boosh-esque shit.
TOOT doo-doo dee doodley doo DOOT 'SHORT"!
Wait your telling me it isn’t “me and the boys gonna RIZZ you up!” ????
Umm...what?
Best hahahahahahahhahah
Vicious Mockery has no attack role though, it has a saving throw, which means when the required dice roll was a nat 20, the spell failed to do any damage.
my new alarm clock noise, this is so well made
Gotta love a bard that doesn’t understand the concept of the enemy having to make a save.
I’ll admit, I’ve only known about the vicious mockery verse from other videos, I didn’t know there was more to it, and now it’s even more fucked up than before. Magnificent. chef’s kiss
I love this
I laughed hysterically when he said “I’ll play my flute when I lot that dead kid’s body” 😂😂😂
Bro rolled three 20s in a row.
this is why I want to play DnD man
Also known as "How NOT to Play DnD"
Doesn't matter how many times I watch this - still hilarious and makes my day.
Lol I play D&D too and the “loot that body” is accurate for me 😂 I steal anything I can get my hands on but I’m also a folk hero so that’s best kept secret…
Im watching this video everyday. I need to stop
Side note: That’s not how vicious mockery works.  Laughed my ass off all the same XD
this is a fucking masterpiece
"When you were born, everybody thought that you were just a head, but then the doctor said, 'Wait, this stupid muthafuckin tiny short ass baby got a tiny little itty bitty body and I hate it!'"
This will never not be hilarious 🤣
S H O R T
POV : You're Lucifer
I FINALLY FOUND IT!!!!
This is the best video on the internet lol
I like how at the start of this the other players look excited to play but by the end it’s more of a “not this again” attitude
Man this song goes so hard
0:10 "pretty cool fail" sounds better
That was magical ✨️
0:37 all I can hear is "So Skibidi" and I hate my brain for it
I love this song❤
Vicious Mockery is my favourite spell ever. And I mean Ever. I give all my characters Vicious Mockery. Always.
This is like one of those the longer you check the worse it gets images.
0:38 "There's no escaping it"  OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  I swear I've been watching animations of this for so long now, and I thought that line was "So skibidi"
As someone who chose bard for thier first dnd campaign I can definitely I am planning to act in a similar manner
so im just starting to understand dnd via bg3 and i play a human half elf bard and this is exactly how i play lmao i always thought id like being a cleric before knowing a single thing about classes never thought id feel more at home as a bard
Dm is finn Barbaian orc is jake Rouge is fern And the bard is Bmo
In case anyone is wondering  Rolling three nat 20s in a row has a 1/8000 chance of happening  That is a cool 0.0125%, or 1 in every 800 times you roll three dice in a row
This is amazing, definitely gonna remember doing something like as a bard whenever I play DnD with my friends.
It made me burst in laughter man i just wish it was longer. Like, if it was episode 1 do 4 or 5 more episodes. Then combine it into 1 full song and it would be EPIC
i read the lyrics yet for the longest time i still heard "theres no escaping it" as "so skibidi", the internet has rotted my brain
This is the best video I've ever seen. I've been watching this on repeat all day
I love every line.
If only I could give this more thumbs.. I need more thumbs!🤣
I love that "It's always a kid" implies that he just regularly goes around casting Vicious Mockery on short people and the victims are often children. Fucking gold.
I want you to know that the person who showed me this video was my audio video production teacher
Now i fucking NEED to play a bard and its all your fault, FUCK
g'damn it hits hard
Im here because someone draw Alastor mocking Lucifer with this audio. 😂
i played a kobold bard in my first dnd campaign i dont wanna hear it
Critical failures: Always funnier in stories instead of the actual game where it turns the most capable, powerful superhero of the ages into the worst, most incompetent idiot imaginable 5% of the time... which is actually a whole lot of the time if your DM makes you roll for trivial things
I can perceive you   🫵👁👄👁
1:40 every rogue ever
I liked all of this except the ending. Kind of a trigger warning for us parents, eh? I was about to share it to my wife and then... can't
“Gotta loot that motherfucka” killed me😂😂😂
I like this!
tubbo has got me obsessed with this, i come back to it like every other day or so
literally humming 'loot that muthafacka' at the end of every fight in BG3, this song is peak gold
That's at least 3d4 of solid psychic damage
As a flute player I fully appreciate the chaotic energy this has.  As a side note, the fake playing is /really/ good.
Please for the love of god create more verses. This is one of the greatest gifts ever given to the YouTube community. Bless us with more 🙏🏻
The slight falsetto on 0:39 “There’s no escaping it” sounded like…   … well, “so skibidi”. 2023 may have left a scar on my intelligence
Bro insulted a child XD
I need to know the chords of this song so I can sing this cuz I'm a bard in a campaign and I have instruments I wanna use for the campaign
The absolute BEST song of 2023. PERIOD.
I toootally didn't mishear "there's no escaping it" as "so skibidi" nope, nope, nope! Not my Gen Z ass.    ....      My ears and brain are fucked.
i’m convinced the reason tc has millions of views is because the same group of 100k nerds view and share these videos 1,000 times per dork. personal experience guiding me
this song healed my relationship with my distant father
Hello, please do you have the sheets for the flute notes? Eeh it's for science ...
this is the best thing on the internet PERIOD
why do i feel like he accidentally killed that one kid from act 2
JUST BEAUTIFUL, THANK YOU
My husband and I now regularly point at our cat and yell "SHORT!" because of this video
What kind of flute is that, I want one  Not the drumstick he’s holding just what’s played in the song
WHEN I HEARD THIS SONG I KNEW YOU SANG IT
Reminds me of my first campaign, where my character threw a hammer at a statue, rolled a one and the statue toppled over on top of 2 gnome children.  Good times...
"It's always a kid"
“I cast vicious mockery, another 20 let’s go “
This is why i love dnd
I'm not saying the bard's dices are weighted, but 3 Nat 20 in a row? C'mon now, something is not right.
FULL SONG PLEASE
So is no one gonna point out that Tom is just holding a regular stick and pretending he was playing a flute like a 10 year old child?
The only bad thing about this song is that its 1:50 too short.
Chaotic evil bard best way to go 🤣🤣🤣
0:59 He sounds a bit like Kyborg.       That's also totally something Kyborg would do, if he was a bard.
The flute twirl is soooo perfect ❤❤❤
If I could explain to you the absolute hold this song has on me…😂
My friend introduced me to you recently! I love your stuff!
TUBBO HAS GOT ME ADDICTED TO THIS
Absolute Masterpiece !
How fucked is my brain if every time he say “no escaping it” all I hear is “you’re so skibidi”
I genuinely dont know if I like the animated version or this version better
The palpable disappointment when the DM saw his nat 20 tells you this is not that bard's first incident.
I am a Korean who does not know English. I was in a good mood today thanks to the video you made. I hope happiness will always be with you.
this critical hit me with Hideous Laughter... i've been prone for hours...
This was far too funny for me. I'm sick. The laughing started wheezing, coughing, and then i puked. I've never puked because something was so funny before. Just thought you should know
my brain is so rotten i thought he said "So skibidi" instead of "theres no escaping it"
*Comedy gold AND catchy!*
SHORT
The sheer confidence with which Tom sold that drumstick as a flute is what I hope to achieve one day
Does anyone know what flute Tom uses? Thanks!
It's a drumstick.
"So what kind of bard are you?" "Never really liked putting labels on myself, but I once managed to bully a child so hard he died. In my defense I didn't know he was a kid, I just assumed he was a midget of some kind" "Ah, I see." *rolls perception to find the nearest exit*
😂☠️ ABSOLUTE KILLER 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
is that even a flute 😂😂
This song is a nat 20
I love how the only reason the DM would despair at the first nat 20 would be because he knows the character is pure chaos
I feel like this is a song that ended too early but at the same time could go on literally forever
Jesus how many instruments can this man play
It's that one harmonized f-bomb that had me rolling.
What's the name of the flute he's playing? I need one xd
I like how he describes the shadowy figures and everybody just assumes they're going to fight and the figures proceed to do nothing the entire song
This killed me. 😂
Vicious mockery is a saving throw hey wait a minute
i don't know why but without looking at the words at 0:38 hear me out but it kind of sounds like "so skibidi"
Was already gonna send this to my party, before the punchline. Our first mission together ended in a dead mind-flayer-child!😂
When I first heard this song, I thought he said "lift" the dead kid's body, so I was imagining the bard just grabbing the kid's body and running off with it 😂
I never thought someone could make playing a flute so damn intense. Damn Tom, keep at it!
omg, I'm very new to DnD, and I'm so glad this showed up in my recs I can't stop rewatching this xDDD and it kills every bloody time!!
You gotta keep this dnd story going man, we need more hahaha
This bard is like Hiemdal from God Of War Ragnarok. Very perceptive, but just does not think.
Huh, what happened to the original video?
It's so fucking good dude 😂
"When times are tough, the only numbers you can roll are 1 or 20."
that's not how vicious mockery works in game but i think i can speak on behalf of most people and say the song is so charming that more than forgives that
I would pay top fucking dollar for a concert bro.
My partner and I just instinctively shout LOOT THAT BODY while playing games now. Thanks.
This is your magnum opus and I will not be convinced  otherwise.
Vicious Mockery isn't a ranged spell attack, though...
"LOOT THAT BODY!" *28 gold and a crossbow* "FUCK"
The look of realization on the DMs face when he asked if the body was just lying there sent me. I've been in that position so many times I did the same damn thing lmfao
the way that he says "loot that motherfuckAA" has permanently changed the way that I experience the world
Tonight we play our very first session migrating from 3.5 to 5e.   My character is named Bard Tom, is a combination of Tom Brady and Silver Tom (Journeyquest), has zero adventuring experience at L1 and is only skilled at womanizing, larceny, and evading injury at the hands of angry husbands and town guardsmen.   This should be fun 🤞
LMFAO!! This is gold! The music is too good.
Fun fact dnd 4e had vicious mockery and it did need an attack role. The rest of the song doesn't give enough to disprove that they might be playing 4e, so I like to think they are.
So groovy, we may end up forgetting child murder, theft and body desecration... If the Bhaal had a groovy bard children, guess that would be Tom...
Love how in the perception check the bard is so satisfied, but slowly realizes who the short figure is halfway through. He even mouths "child" at the same time the DM says it just to drive home the fact that this is not the first time the bard has done this LOL
PLEASE I NEED THE FULL SONG😂😂
Can confirm as a bard main this is 90% of my gameplay
Video inspired (in part) by BG3, came here from a BG3 animation of this song. Truly made it.
I died at “B**ch”
I love how vicious mockery is just roasting the fuck out of a foe and depending on how high the dice roll is they don't take it that well 🤣
This man is the spiritual successor to Tenacious D
Blumineck's pole dancing routine brought me here
This is my dark urge bard 😂😂😂
I need more songs like this I love it so much
Umm ackshually Vicious mockery is a wisdom saving throw so you wouldn't make a roll, the child would
When I first heard this without seeing the vid this is exactly what I imagined the video looking like. Incredible
The phrase "It's always a child" implies that this has happened at least a few other times. *How many children has he murdered. This bard cannot keep getting away with this.*
ONE OF US. ONE OF US. ONE OF US!
the fact i have watched this WAY to many times and just noticed he's using a dfrum stick and not a wood flute....
Am I going crazy? is this a reposting or am i living another life via dreams? i very clearly remember seeing this over 4 months ago huh?
I keep hearing “so skibidi” help 💀  BUT THIS SONG IS SO SILLI
loooot that muthafucKAHH
You rolled a Nat 20 on this song, Tom! I’ve been listening to it for the last week almost hourly and I CANNOT GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD! Good on ya, mate. Cheers 🍻
Hehe heeeeeeeee https://youtu.be/X8PKP0K1Hf8?si=cGKUyhwUemFithfT
I adore how every dnd party has seen this and done animations and reenactments to it. It just redonated
Perhaps the most destructive Vicious Mockery in D&D history. That's the kind of Vicious Mockery that deals critical damage no matter what you rolled.
This isn't even an exaggeration of what happens in an average dnd session tbh
HERE FROM TUBBOS TWITCH! HE LOVES U!!
The way he says "gotta loot that muthafucka" gets me and idk why.
I have a date tomorrow and all I'm going to hear in my head is: "Loot that body!"
Quick question: Vicious Mockery is a spell that requires the target to succeed on a wisdom saving throw to avoid damage, rather than have the caster make an attack roll. Therefore, 1:00, what is the bard getting a natural 20 on?
Tom BARDY.
This is fcking hilarous, i love it!
The fact that being short is enough of a roast to just aggressively with all seriousness scream "short" made me lose my goddamn mind
Man as a DM this speaks to me in so many levels, and it makes me sad.
Whenever someone mentions Vicious Mockery all I can think of is this video by Tom Cardy  https://youtu.be/ZjlYFWLUDBQ?si=p1irY3I6eIYfNhxv
Well, I have a sore face from going on an hour binge of these videos, I can't laugh anymore or I'll develop a tumor, probably. PLEASE MORE D&D CONTENT. And the Australia roots was hilarious.
imho the original is still the best <3
I demand more D&D and Pathfinder content from you, now
3 million of those views are just me
I love the "It's always a kid!" like this has happened before XD
I just can't decide which one is funnier bewteen the animation and the original.
Finally now on Spotify!
@tom cardy But wait, what happened to the other cloaked figures?  Those moth4f7rs meant to harm you, so we've got to know!  (Perception Check 2 plz)
I didn’t realize how aggressive he says ‘SHORT’ and ‘BITCH’ till I actually watched the video and it’s killing me- /pos
I love this song lol, but is viscious mockery an attack roll? Or is it a saving throw done by the target?
Possibly the hardest I've laughed in Years.  Thanks for that!!
It's hilarious how DnD gives bards a move to belittle their foes into death.
WHY DID I THINK HE SAID "So skibidi" AT 0:38 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I HATE MY LIFE
does vicious mockery work over the internet? Cause I think I'm dead
+
This has a life of its own on TIkTok with fantasy cosplayers having a go at it....
This is a banger. For sure.
The bard is going on a killstreak
I've watched this at least two dozen times and every time I do I laugh so hard I change the migration path of local birds.
This has lived rent-free for the past few months and I'm going to need to start charging for inflation reasons
My dad laughed his tits off while watching this
I love how from the first Nat 20 the DM already knows this isn’t going to end well
This song is so catchy, man! This guy's a genius 😂👌🏻
Someone kill me I can't stop hearing "so skibidi" when he sings there's no escaping it
Jesus fucking christ
That party was unbelievably tight
After wathcing this 10 times while laughing just as hard each time, i realized... The bard is playing on a drum stick. Not a flute.. Best video ever.
I really want to play the flute parts with my own flute
Whats stopping you from making a music video of this?
the realization of what he's going to do. "...Don't." 😂
This feels like a CG5 song dear god😂
I still think the funniest part is that Vicious Mockery isn't a spell attack roll, it's a saving throw.
"These motherfuckers' beans are hummus."
When I first heard this I was like "meh", then I started playing Balder's Gate and I absolutely get it now.  This is just hilarious.
This is.. just... the best shit in the world. I somehow didn't think you'd be a RPG playa.
You notice one of them is shorter I CAST VICIOUS MOCKERY NAT 20 LETS FUCKING GO
"I rolled a one", "I rolled a one", "F*ck" lives on repeat in my head
S H O R T
My favorite part about this is that the human bard plays a human bard
This has Flight of the Concords vibes…
I don't understand shit, but this is Fire 🔥🔥🔥
100% the reason I'm playing a bard in BG3 right now *shreds a flute solo BI*CH!
The animated version is tight, but there’s no denying the OG’s hip movements.
As a bard I totally get it
i love how the GM is just already upset when the nat 20 lands and the bard is let's go. The crime is this song is too short.
This has nothing to do with the video but nice earring
"Lute that body!"
A flute takes two hands, so if he plays the flute while looting the body does that mean that he's looting the kid's body with his feet? That's even worse.
The whole song is hilarious but the part that always leaves me in stitches is the last second "BITCH"
That drumstick flute though.
1:40 the first time I heard this i genuinely thought it said lube that body 😭😭😭
Man, i liked that animation for that song. It's what made me discover this great tune but i need help now. I had already what mayve +30 different animatic of OC with that song and i can't stop it!
not me hearing "theres no escaping it" as "so skibidi" 💀
the storyteller struggling to delay the inevitable but eventually ending up saying 'yes' was hilarious
So we all know that Tom rolled an attack roll instead of asking the DM to make a saving throw because it's funnier to have his character bulldoze over the DM, but now that I think about it, Vicious Mockery used a Charisma attack roll vs. Will defense in 4e, and nothing in this song indicates that these guys aren't playing 4e instead of 5e.
LMAO! That was Sam Riegel level barding right there! Giving Scanlan a run for his money. 😂😂😂
The spirit of D&D lives in this song!
I found this because someone made a little animatic with BG3 characters. I love it, I'm dead.
I wish this song was longer but it so perfect at the same time.
This is exactly the kind of player I am
I’m so brain dead I found this song through a goofy animation of the song and I thought when he sang “There’s No escaping it” I thought he was saying “so skibidi” LIKE I DONR EVEN LIKE OR UNDERSTAND THAT MEME WHY DID MY BRAIN PROCESS IT LIKE THAT
This is giving me Shrek vibes, and this is the only thing I can think about right now
Holy shit dude. This would be an amazing character to have a guest appearance on Critical Role or Dimension 20. I'd love to watch you come in like a whirlwind of chaos and watch Matt or Brennan try to keep up.
0:19 The "Active perception check" was all on off beat, then led to the short silent pause, most brilliant 😂
i still play this every time i play bg3 and it brings me such joy
As a DM, I love this so much.
I died a couple times during this, but specifically the: "Me and my boys are gonna mess you up" "I rolled a one" "I rolled a one" "FUCK"  and  "Specifically the child you and your party have been looking for for the past 15 days game time and five days of our actual lives"  I felt the anger in that line. and the faces of the other party members.
Funny meme, but in actuality one of the worse kinds of players to play with, I can't recall the amount of times a player like that just wouldn't shut up and let me describe the scene to them.
wait actually i need a music sheet for this bc i play the flute
The moment you realize that he’s jamming on a drum stick 😂
This came on my Spotify Discover Weekly and I am forever grateful
Baldurs gate 3 dice?
I want a full song of this. I mean like an actual 2-4 minute song of this entire encounter going on because it is simply golden!
This song just scratches my brain in the best way possible.
There's no escape sounds like so skibbidi
Perfection
Man, this is my favourite! I fucking cracked up at this.
this is becoming some sort of antidepressant or anti anxiety pills for me. i come here whenever i need some comfort
ok but what is the original instrument? Cause you can't play the flute on a drumstick but what is it? Or what is the name of what it represents please someone help!
This is epic af! Best use of vicious mockery I have seen in quite a while :D
I need a full 5 minute version of this song. It's epic!
how can so much be crammed into less than a 2 minute song
~Loot that body! ~
I THINK WE NEED AN EXTENDED VERSION 😂
Spotify release when
I want this to be longer!!!
I've been watching a bunch of crime videos. Ones about entitled people being arrested and ones about corrupt cops and the like. for SOME reason as soon as this video ended I got a bunch of recommendations for crime videos involving children being killed.  Which only adds to the dark comedy of this video.
SHORT
Larian set me here.
Masterpiece.
This has big Flight of the Concords energy and I absolutely love it
This is one of the stupidest songs ever. (I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!)
Im so glad that non of my players bards.
I would just like to point out that the whiteboard says “cheese knees”
This stereotype is of people who play bards is very accurate or at least with my dnd groups.
That "bitch✨️" at the end was awesome.
Loot that body!
To be clear my wife hates you, but I've decided I want you as the best man at my future wedding.
Meanwhile the two kidnappers just standing there like "What the fuck did we just witness?"
This is such a master class in comedic timing. Amazing. It's been stuck in my head for two months nonstop. Cannot say enough nice things about this song and video (and subsequent animation).
I've watched this so much. I fully and completely adore this. Well done!
I seriously thought he had a flute (but im a drummer) and i noticed the fucking drum stick.  Dear god, comedy gold.
When I first heard this song the "there's no escaping it" part sounded like "so skibidi" and now I cant unhear it and I wanna kms
Guys i've watched this video about 100 times and i'm only just now realizing the "Flute" that tom is playing is actually just a drumstick.
Please tell me there’s an extended version of this song I can download on iTunes and it make me ringtone please and thank you
Fun fact they just released this song on apple musics just this past Dec 25 was a very nice Christmas surprise for me.
I'm addicted. The 0:42 part is perfect.
Sometimes I cast Precious Flattery on my cat and change the lyrics to "You're a soft fluffer-nutter and everyone loves you! (SOFT!) Everybody says 'Look how fucking soft that cat is' and this helps you with forming meaningful relationships! When you were born everybody thought that you were just so cute but then the vet-tech said 'WAIT! This super mothafluffer tiny cute-ass kitty got a fluffy little itty-bitty body and I love it!'" Absolutely shatters his mind 😻
Something I only recently noticed is that parts with the Bard singing has two layers of vocals, one for Tom's Bard and one for Tom himself
This is the best thing that happened in 2023
Hear me out. Tom Cardy and Brennan Lee Mulligan in a movie as a bard and rogue going on an adventure.
I like how the flute sounds in this one.
that "SHORT!" felt so personal 💀
ladies and gents if you want a perfect description of any d and d or pathfinder game, just show them this video
Can you imagine being one of the other members of the cloaked party? A random guy in medieval city wear runs up to your son and yells at him, crippling him for the rest of his life?
What did he roll for when casting vicious mockery?
I think I need "Loot that body, gotta loot that body now, Loot that body, gotta loot that mutha7ka" as a sound byte that I can attach to a button. Whenever my party finishes an encounter "I hit the Loot the body button"
Tom's amazing flute twirl has me mesmerised
1:38 the best part of the song
I require more DND songs that slap this hard
The two taller cloaked figures seeing the whole event unfold before their very eyes:  👁️👄👁️
I honestly need a longer version.   This is gold
This is pure gold!!!
i multiclassed astarion into bard and yeah, it pretty much was exactly this LMAO
Part of what made BG3 my game of the year was just how much playing a Bard was exactly like this.  Entered a fireworks factory through the roof. Everything on the top floor is on fire or exploding. My team has to go down some iced-up stairs. Which I iced up myself of course. I send the bard down first, no problem. Then it's time for Karlach, Astarion and Jaheira to make it down and one after another "I rolled a 1!" as I watch Karlach slip, blocking the entire stairs, then Astarion has to try to jump over her fallen body, but stumbles and falls as he tries to do so, and lastly Jaheira doesn't even make it past the first step before taking a tumble herself. All the while my bard who took HP damage dash-jumping down a full floor of the building to get to the enemies ASAP just standing there like "fuck" as the entirety of the tight crew is now just in a giant pile on the stairs one and a half floors above her and she's surrounded but good with hardly any spell slots left because camping is for suckers. So all I've got for the next turn is a single wimpy rapier swing or... cast vicious mockery... okay let's fucking go!  10/10, would Bard again.
Honestly when he asked if the body was just laying there i got scared 😂😅 i mean, he's a bard...
You don't actually...roll a d20 for Vicious Mockery, but oh well this is great either way lol
"I rolled a one", "I rolled a one", "fuck" Is the greatest line was amazing
Ah, yes. The comundrum
“Me and ma boys are gonna mess you up” “I rolled a 1” “I rolled a 1” “-fuck” just KILLS me
I'm like the guy who don't know about TRPG stuff before I played Baldur's Gate 3, but after that, this thing is fucking masterpiece.
I need the initial toot every single day.
This is the best song ever.
i want more bard songs. this on a loop for 6 hours straight is good, but it could have friends
The “BITCH!” At the end kills me. 🤣
I NEED this on Spotify like now!
SHORT
Note the DM's reaction at that first natural 20. This is not the first time Tom has done something like this.
Love this song have listen to it over 30 times lol so good
A Bard with CHA so high he overrides the fact that Viscious Mockery is actually a Will SAVE on the targets end with his own Nat 20.
"it's always a kid" inplies this isnt the first time the bard killed a kid
I would love to see a behind-the-scenes of either the making of this video or the song. Or both.
beautiful
This is hilarious
the flute makes this a thousand times better 😂
Loot that body!
It’s 2:03AM when I watch this and I’m still boppin to it!
For some reason 'SHORT' takes me out every time.
This goes so hard!!
This has been stuck in my head for weeks please help
“So skibidi” “There’s no escaping it”
nice try tom we all know you actually said "so skibidi" at 0:38
This goes hard.
I feel like the intrumental rings a bell in my mind but I can't put the finger on it.
Masterpiece.
Its just so dang good...and accurate!
ew vertical video
0:38 I swear to fucking God he said "so skibidi"
What I can't stop thinking about is that there's no pause between saying he'll be better and him asking about the body.   He didn't apologize and then notice; he was already thinking about it.
I'm so happy right now😂 I f# cking love this song ❤😂
dude i roled a 1 on perception myself - it took me way too many rewatches to notice IT'S NOT A FLUTE
Been seeing this song popping up around tiktok a lot. Between that and Youtube Shorts latching on to Red Flags, I'm glad you're getting the attention you deserve
So happy to know that bards rolling nat 20s and killing children is a common experience in dnd campaigns
When you're so good at barding you can cast viscous mockery at an npc and at the DM at the same time.
it was funny the first time i seen it on twitter, and its still funny now
we need a full...fuller version XD
Australia and everyone living in it is the god's gift to the world and you can't convince me otherwise. This is a whole different level of great and I'm here for it.
SHORT
"I be better" is an absolute lie.
The immediate response of “Let’s fucking go” reminded me so much of myself.
🦩
Didn't realize this guy is mixed message guy. So talented 😮
taako, is that u?
I almost forgot to listen to this today...
I needed this and I don't know why.
Somebody call Matt Mercer IMMEDIATELY.
0:38 the internet has ruined me. If it ruined you too, you'll know what I mean   "So skibidi" 💀
-"Me and my boys are gonna mess you up!"  -"I rolled a 1." -"I rolled a 1."  -"FUCK."  This had me in tears laughing so hard.
Holy shit hahahahahahaha
this is amazing
That “*SHORT*” felt personal
best DND song
Best representation of DND I've ever heard dude..
Best representation of DND I've ever heard dude..
I want to learn to play the flute now.
"your so skibidi"
I need a tshirt of a white silhouette absolutely JAMMING on the flute with the caption "Loot that body!"
0:38
the music in this video is so good.
Okay, i dont see nobody talking about how 0:34-0:35 is fucking smooth
This is my go-to theme song for a good laugh, and also the reason I play a Bard in all my campaigns. Jack of All Trades is too good with Sword Bard.
How many perception rolls did it take you to realise he's playing the flute on a drum stick!? 😂
I love this song, but there is this knocking in the background that led me to question my sanity so 10/10 would again
I could listen to the vicious mockery on repeat for a week
I love how his first thought after killing the kid with Vicious Mockery was looting his body. 💀
This is what happens when the bard has 20 charisma, 16 intelligence, and 6 wisdom
Gods this is so good. I already loved this when I first came across it, but now having seen the Secret Life Animatic and a couple others as well, I just wish it was on spotify so that I could put it into a bunch of playlists ajfdhdjkf
So skibidi 0:38
My dnd group has 2 out of 5 bards (me included) im a dragon born bard and the other guy is a teethling bard. (So monster f*kers) Any time we are needed its a last result. We give eachother the "look" then we both roll for charm and one time we both rolled nat 1 and accidentally quoted this song
Every DM friend of mine: "vicious mockery isn't an attack roll!" lol
I showed this to a friend of mine. She laughed at it and then called me various insults
So when is this song going to be on Apple music?
Perception check, sure sure. But what about the slight of hand check needed for all of us to miss the fact that Tom was playing the flute on a drumstick the whole time?
I've never played D&D.  This is the best song that I've ever heard.
I NEED this song on deezer! Please!!
I decided that  I am an addicted, it's been moths and yet I am here.
I love this so much that I've watched it over and over again I just can't get enough of it can you do another one or more?
is this on itunes? cause i so want to buy this song! 🤩
Wait a second, vicious mockery is a saving throw for the opposed creature.
Don't 😂
I started playing a Bard in a new campaign and I forget I’m a bard 90% of the time so I just swing with a quarter staff and miss 100% of the time. I’m a terrible bard but I survived to level 7 so far!
This video is my life now
How's it feel singlehandedly creating the biggest & most widely spread D&D meme since The Gazebo Story?
1:05 SHORT 😂😂😂 the look of intensity on his face kills me
I can't stop coming back to this song every time xD
i need it out on plateforms. I NEED IT
my favourite bit by *far* is:  "Me and ma boys gonna mess you up" "I rolled a 1." "I rolled a 1." "Fuck." *toot*  had me cry laughing omfg
Make a song with this
The Gen alpha "genre" ruined 0:38 for me Listen to this "So skibidi, I can perceive you Here's what we're gonna do [Flute] Me and my boys gonna rizz you up I rolled a one x2 Fuck"
Peak dnd
I can’t stop hearing so skibidi at 0:37
I perceive that this will become a new meme soon
🎵Loot that body 🎵
Absolutely making a human bard whose name is tom and a bisexual bitch. Thank you, Mr. Cardy
Its the next Weird Al Yankovic i can FEEL it
Real loser nerds would talk about how vicious mockery is a save and hence the player cant get a nat 20 lmao
I long for a Tom Cardy / Jazz Emu collab
OMG❣❣❣❣L😂😂😂😂😂😂L...ROTFL..F@CK& REAL.NICE
*Sick flute* Me and the boys are gonna mess you up!  (Rolled a one;  Rolled a one) FUCK!
I need this as a video
The next WEIRD AL! As a hard core WEIRD AL fan, this is a powerful complement that is not to be taken lightly!
i like how you have the first 'fuck' be right at the 30 sec mark, just in range of youtube's first 30 sec no swear requirement
0:38 Sounds like he is saying "SO SKIBIDDY" instead of the text incorporated into the actual video.
When the content creator doesn't like anyone's comments. They rolled a 1. Even though they are a natural 20. I don't understand, no matter.
That loot that body energy is absolutely hilarious and I never expected it as a new DM. Just grab all the shiiit you can find cuz you never know...
ive never played dnd but from what ive seen this is just what bards are like
This is so much like actual D&D encounters that I refuse to believe the scenario was fabricated just for the song.
I miss read the title as Perception Cooking, and I was confused, to say the least
There needs to be many more of these. Hilarious!
This song sings to my bardic soul
this song needs a full version defo
I desperately need this on Spotify-
I wish BG3 had "You're a short motherfucker and nobody likes you!" as a vicious mockery insult.
When you're such a good bard, you roll a nat 20 on an ability that calls for a saving throw from your opponent.
This is just the best
This video just made me uninstall 3 whole video games just to reinstall bg3 cuz I wanna do silly bard things again
Anyone know the bpm of this song? I want to do an animation for it
I love how bards are generally most loyal to their party, and very happy to have freinds, even if their party is annoyed by them, and then the bards are brutal to everyone else
Can you please post the musical notations for this? I want to play it on my tin whistle
The fact that Tom Cardy not only plays D&D but is also a Bard, is peak to me.
This song is a banger.
This is way too good  :D What a bop!
This a bit too funny to watxh while high
Love from a Vaush and OneShotQuesters fan!
this is such an accurate description of DnD players lol
I love how DM Tom is the only one fed up with bard Tom while barbarian Tom and rogue Tom are just cool with it😂
Heavy Scanlan vibes there XD
May I use a clip of your music to make an animation of my dnd characters?
I've listened to this an unhealthy amount of times and i can't stop
I cannot not hear "So Skibidi" at 0:38 and I am not sure if I should blame my own dumb brain or internet society for meming.
I have watched this more than twice.  Please do a full d&d campaign like this. Lol
Oh dear. RAW you can't critically fail (or succeed) a skill check. In fact critical fails don't exist at all in 5e and critical success only applies to the damage of attack rolls. Now, I agree, players like a little bonus for rolling a 20 but automatic skill success is a slippery slope and if we're gonna start changing the rules I really think we should probably be using passive floor for the perception checks (and most skills outside of initiative). Also, viscous mockery causes the target to save, it doesn't require a spell attack roll. Do you even D&D Bro? 😂
We need full song
In the last few days views have gone from 3.2M to 3.3M. I'd like to think my multiple viewings per day added significantly to this.
cheese knees
I love how the part accompanying the kid is just chill with the bard looting the dead kid's body
When he says "there's no escaping it" the only thing I hear is "so skibidi"
She has to roll to ready her weapon?
When you max your charisma and your geh.
This song is living rent free in my head and i love it
The concept of a player rolling a nat 20 perception check, but IRL being too impatient to perceive the result is a great setup.
Of course the bard's not paying attention in the beginning to know his boys rolled a 1.
So good!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Ngl, I thought they were gonna try resurrecting the child.
OMG this is so freakin hilarious!!! Such Flight of the Concords vibes, you guys would be buds
I swear the more I watch this the funnier it gets
This is my Bard! Her name is Devalynne, and I love her! My daughter (who I also play with), is a Dragonborn Barbarian, and is constantly yelling at me for getting into situations JUST like this. My husband is the DM, and he just laughs and goes along...
We need part 2
Please for all the holy put this Apple Music
I shouldn't have this song on repeat right? Oh well.
I honestly can't stop listening to this, it's just so amazing
You people need to stop being all like "AKCHUALLY vicious mockery doesn't have the caster roll anything", there is literally only one edition where that's true and nothing in the video indicates that's the edition being played here.
This will never not be the funniest thing I've ever fucking seen. 😂
Bro needs to make the song longer it's too catchy
hey i was just wondering but does anyone know the make of the flute?
Took me ages to realise his flute is a drumstick
Perfection
here after bg3 won goty let's go
Couldn't remember last time I laughed that hard ... this is pure gold!
I almost forgot to watch this today
"I rolled a one." "I rolled a one." "Fuck." I lost it. Too real
The line "it's always a kid" always gets me. As if this isn't the first time the bard has killed a kid.
I never played DnD. Is this how it goes?
😂I love it!  Your music reminds me of the mighty boosh. ❤
That's just how DND is
I want to download this song please tell me where I can send my money lol
i love this song  its funny
“Critically fails to hide behind a tree.” Bruh.
This is still the best thing ever.
Why yes, I have seen this many times. Will see it many more. Side note: even though he only needs to switch and hold different characters briefly, his acting is still noteworthy. JMHO.
i have a theory that he was gonna immidiately cast vicious mockery but paused because he realised DM hasn't told him any identifying information yet
why have i listened to this like 15 times in the past 2 days.
I think it says something about Disney, despite having probably multiple songwriters on their team, that their latest movie didn't have any good or memorable songs in it... While Tom made this whole 1 minute and 50 seconds replay in our minds for the past 5 days... On LOOP 🤣
0:38 - sounds like "So Skibidi"
I would love some more D&D content that had me in tears laughing awesome content.
Imagine a D&D character that is so much of an ass hole to the point where he always gets what he wants through sheer bullying
😂😂😂😂😂 this is gold
We need a full song please.
Cheese knees!
This man has great talent huh
mockery nat 20 slaps
Hey big dog, I know this is a bit of a long shot but do you know what kind of flute generates the tone you used for this video? I need one for jamming.
My bf inspired by this song is going to be a kazoo based bard 😂
Me and my friends DnD campaign in a nutshell:
This is my go-to song for fighting back the Darkness, even if I do end up with Hideous Laughter.
This is by far the funniest thing I've seen in ages
Here from Simon's Important Videos during the Jingle Jam. Hi Yognaughts!
Vicious Mockery isnt even a spell you roll attack for. That nat20 is invalid.
Please make more, I need more songs to sing in character
Why. Cant. I. Stop. Watching. This.
i wish i had the improve skills to IRL act out being a bard.
I love how it just starts with a single flute note
THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING!
I wish this was on spotify so much
This is a jam. It is so hilarious with all the nat 20s and 1s, that I forgot for a minute that vicious mockery is a wisdom save, not an attack roll. Still is funny though, and it could 100% be overlooked in the moment only to be remembered later... XD
I love how the bard looks like he constantly has to take a pee break
The delivery of "BITCH" at the end is perfect
I fucking love this
I love this song soo much!!!😱 When is it coming too Spotify!!???  I need it with bardic inspiration by 1 for all,  World's best RPG and rage  by Yazick with more.😶
Did you actually play the flute on this? Also it makes sense that you're aa Bard
it's been 2 months and I'm still laughing every time I listen to this.
I can't stop watching this haha
I absolutely love this tune.
had to double check to realize that hes actually playing a drumstick...
"My boys are otherwise engaged, so im gonna bring it ALL Myself” when your bard multiclassed in rogue / sub-classed in College of Swords, and ends up going full speed 'assassins creed'.
0:58 Vicious Mockery is a saving throw spell. A Nat 20 should've meant that the kid shrugged it off effortlessly.
This has to end up becoming a full song, PLEAASEEE
Nat 20, let's go!
Why in the 9 hells, is this such a banger oh my gods above
1:24 I love how angry he sounds during the word “child”
I'm short and I love it
I love how entirely done the DM is. Man theoretically spent hours on that campaign.  What did he have tho?
Certainly! Creating a song can involve various elements like lyrics, melody, and rhythm. Here's a simple set of lyrics for a Tom Cardy-inspired song:  (Verse 1) In the world of laughter, where the moments never end, There's a guy named Tom Cardy, a true and funny friend. With a skateboard in his hand, and a twinkle in his eye, He's carving up the streets, reaching for the sky.  (Chorus) Tom Cardy, riding high, under the open sky, With a grin that never fades, in his own sweet serenade. Skating through the day, in his own Cardy way, Tom Cardy, we cheer for you, in everything you do.  (Verse 2) Through the ups and downs, in this crazy, spinning town, Tom's the one who makes us smile, even when we're feeling down. With his humor and his wit, breaking through the noise, He's the skater, he's the creator, our laughter's endless source.  (Chorus) Tom Cardy, riding high, under the open sky, With a grin that never fades, in his own sweet serenade. Skating through the day, in his own Cardy way, Tom Cardy, we cheer for you, in everything you do.  (Bridge) From the ramps to the streets, to the beats of the heart, Tom Cardy's carving dreams, making every moment art. With every kick, every flip, and every goofy grin, He's the skater we admire, in this world we're spinning in.  (Chorus) Tom Cardy, riding high, under the open sky, With a grin that never fades, in his own sweet serenade. Skating through the day, in his own Cardy way, Tom Cardy, we cheer for you, in everything you do.  (Outro) So here's to Tom Cardy, in this song we sing, A melody of joy, let your skateboard take the swing. Through the ups and downs, and the streets we roam, In the world of laughter, you've found a place called home.
I need a long version of this song ....
"But then the Doctor said" has no business going as hard as it does.
I’m confused why shouldn’t you loot the body? Shouldn’t you loot every body?
What’s the sheet music
The fact that you don't even roll for vicious mockery so he just rolled for fun and still got a nat 20
I love it.
i love the implications that "its always a kid" has behind it
the boy can move
Ye gods, there's something about the chorus of this that reminds me so strongly of another song, but I can't for the life of me remember what it is. Anyone got any ideas?
holy shit dude
I love how you rock that drumstick 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok but can we talk about Tom's hip work during the vid ? That got me mesmerized lol
I imagine this is the song that plays through my friend's head every time he does an action lol. I mean he killed of his last character by seducing a dragon 😅
Love the notes the singers hit- chord? Idk I'm not versed in music vernacular. Anyways I like the way the singers sound when they go "me and my boys are gonna mess you up"
I zoned out so fucking hard to this. It’s so fucking good
I think what I missed the first six times I watched this was that he clearly wasn’t paying attention at all. So while his bard themself may have rolled a 20, you can’t fix stupid. I guess I failed the perception check myself because I didn’t notice it at first
There is no way this is just 2 months old, I swear I've been listening to it for 5+ years and it's fully integrated as a part of my personality now
on the bright side he isnt trying to seduce a dragon
Eeeeh you don't roll the d20 yourself for the vicious mockery, it's a saving throw so the crit success means your vicisous mockery is a fail.
what flute is that? i cant get the out of my mind ive listened to it at work for hours damn
I have never played with a bard but I had a very horny rouge friend once that was basically a bard
0:38 so skibidi
I’m fairly certain that I’m responsible for at least half of the total views of this video.
the viscous mockery in this song accidently happened in our campaign, my paladin (wild magic with flavor) accidently used vicious mockery on a small goblin child that was beating up our magic hat.
The flute solo at the end followed by the aggressive "BITCH" has me fucking dying every time
.....vicious mockery is a saving throw spell
Honestly, those two nat 1s are what you get when you roll before the DM asks you to roll for anything 🤣
Yup, yup, this all checks out.
You can't crit fail a skill check.
I find myself coming back.... and back..... and back again for this is the best tune of our times.
Imma need a full version of this song asap! It is highly addictive and has been stuck in my head for a week now!
Guys I think the Bard in this song was cheating he rolled three natural twenties in a row.  The chance of that is one out of eight thousand.  Lol
"You can see that his magical sword is a +5 Keen Flaming bastard sword." "I can see that his magical sword is a +5 Keen Flaming bastard sword!" "He crits on a 17 and chops your arm off. White-hot pain sears the stump where it used to be."
This song is so funny and somehow also a banger
This is it. This is all of dnd
i need more dnd themed songs from him.
THIS SONG IS SO CATCHY
I love this. So fucking much.
why is nobody talking about the perfect moment when he's hyping up his team and they both roll a 1. just the timing of "I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1...FUCK" gets me everytime
Yes, I've listened to this every day since it's been released, what of it?
If Flight of the Conchords played D&D, they would have absolutely made this.
I love how into the DM's narration the other 2 players are at the start, they're spellbound
We need a whole album of this play game. Loot that body
I love it
My main problem with this song is that its SHORT!
I THOUGHT HE SAID "SO SKIBIDI" WHEN HE SAID "THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT" KILL ME-
I like this is now becoming the background music to d&d shorts all over YouTube glad I saw it here 1st
I BEG YOU TO RELEASE THIS SONG
I've watched this so many times youtube knows to keep it on my front page.
Vicious Mockery is a Save (in D&D, not sure about Baldur's Gate) not an Attack Roll And there were a group of figures, not just the kid  But I imagine the GM just let this happen to punish the Bard, lol
Bro ruined 5 days of them playing and the DMs whole conclusion to the story because he was bored.
he ask the DM for what he see not because of the Nat 20 Perception, but because he needed the material to roast whatever it is that he see with Vicious Mockery. what a champ.
Accurate representation of bards tbh
Ah, the famous chaotic neutral human bard. The best kinds of players in my opinion. Memorable moments to be had for sure.
how did you get footage of me playing dnd?
1:04 SHORT
I've had "Me and my boys are gonna mess you up." *I rolled a 1.* "I rolled a 1."  *"Fuck."*  stuck in my head for like two weeks now and I keep coming back to this song to hear it again.
Have you seen that meme of a soldier firing an RPG captioned: “when you shoot an arrow and rolls a nat 20”. This video is the equivalent of that meme for vicious mockery.
This has no right to be such a BANGER of a song.... i play it on repeat xD
I swear to god I misheard “there’s no escaping it” as “so skibidi” and I HATE MYSELF FOR IT, now you all have to never unhear it too.
> go to party to deliver the child they have been looking for > Barbarian is failing to ready his hammer and rouge is doing a crap job at hiding > bard walks up to the child > proceeds to give most horrific insult mentally killing the child as it collapses > bard realising it’s the child loots the mentally destroyed child just because Yep that’s DnD
I absolutely love this song.  It's amazing.  However, I would also love a version of this where you and the boys actually mess them up.  Like, the part where it's "Me and the boys are gonna mess you up!" then you proceed to give everyone inspiration by directing and describing their actions, and I just think that would be a perfect bop.
I think their bard is playing with loaded dice...
0:46 that is the most real fuck I’ve ever heard
What happened to the rest of the cloaked figures though?
yes
moments like this is why I encourage my players to explain what they say/do to cast vicious mockery. They've been pretty creative with it xD
ive seen this too many times it just soo good
I just cannot get tired of hearing this. Love it.
i found out about the spell vicious  mockery from this song and then i got to be a bard and casted it on the 3’ 4” gnome in our party
“His body’s just laying there right? Right?” Gave such Ed vibes (from This Flag Means Death)
bro, My favorite part is when Tom just mocks the short one, I do that all the Time! especially when tom specifically points out short
Press 2 for a natural 20 :D
Oh man. I’ve had this on repeat all night. Makes me want to try DnD. Never tried. Never really been interested. This is fun as shit tho!
Man I'd kill for the instrumental for this
As a dnd fan (I’m a half dragon rouge :3) I love this. Thank you, Tom.     I also loot bodies way too much
this is glory
I've never seen so many critical fails and nat 20s in one go.
In spite of how he jumps the gun in a way that ruins good progress, I still admire the bards ability to roll with the punches when something happens 😆
I shit you not this happened nearly word for word in my last session
Once im able to im making this my ringtone
"Its always a kid!" - I see you are down this road not for the first time :D
Fun fact: because the chance of this progression of rolls happening is 1 in 3,200,000, we know divine providence intervened to inspire this song.
This is absolute fire
I assumed that the bard was going to try and resurrect the kid, but it appears I was naive x)
When is this gem being released on Spotify?
This makes me so inexplicably joyful! 💜🤣🤘🏼
Make a part 2!!!!! Play my flute while I loot that dead kid's body!
Perception check: Failed  you didn't realize he was actually blowing a drum stick
My favourite thing is that 1) the doctor just immediately hated the baby and 2) felt the need to declare it 😂😂
I found a new favorite song
This needs to be on Spotify😂
Inaccurate, he’s getting actually good rolls from a d20
My favorite part is how confidently the DM says "You notice one is a little 'shorter'" heavily implying it's the child they've been looking for the whole time but it goes right over his head lol
I need a full version of this in my life so bad.
This is amazing, you are a comedy genius and I think I love you. NAT 20 GO!
Hey, I found the original!
I listen to this at least twice a day
Ok, know that I've listened to this ~1MM times, I've decided that my favorite part is when the DM is getting back into it after saying "let's slow this all down a bit." He leans forward, smiles, and is so proud of himself for this part. The whole thing is about to pay off and it makes him happy. Then... Vicious Mockery.
Why is this not on Spotify yet?! I'm obsessed!
This goes so hard, it should be a crime
Everytime I listen to this song I keep expecting the "Okay let's slow it down" to lead into a slow part of the song
You ALWAYS loot the body!
1:44 - “GOTTA LOOT THAT MOTHAFUCKA!”
I need this as a Full song, or just as is posted on Spotify. Totally a repeat song for me.
The very solid and sincere "BITCH" really does wonders to cap off this masterpiece
It's been decades since I've played but when I heard "I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1... Fuck"  I had an anxiety attack...
This would be ten times funnier if the bard was a halfling. Just absolutely demolishing this kid for being short.
This would be a good song even though it's been months since this video was posted
hahaha this is amazing xD
I'm really sorry about this but I'm a rules lawyer through and through so I can't resist........ Viscous Mockery requires a saving throw not an attack roll.
I love the resignation by the DM at the first nat 20, he knows exactly what is about to happen because it was the bard who gets to react first.
Just sheer brilliance
I'm listening to this on repeat to cure my depression and.. it's working. I'VE FOUND MY TEMPORARY CURE!!
Exactly how I imagine bards playing. Literally singing everything with a constant playing background music
When the character has advantage but the player has disadvantage... and possibly blind.
An entire album detailing a campaign like this would be 🤌
I've honestly watched this so many times 🥰  Thanks for making me laugh always! ^_^
Well, knowing it was a bard I was suprised this all did not go into the other wrong direction.
“That’s a 1” “I rolled another 1” “Nat 20, let’s fucken go.” This perfectly describes what happened with my party in our VERY FIRST combat experience, warlock buries her axe in the ground behind the target, I ricocheted off the target’s armor as a ranger, after we barely managed to win that fight we both ace acrobatics checks, mine of course being a nat 20
Had a bunch of people asking me if this coming to Apple Music. Hopefully we rolled a nat 20 and it will be on Apple Music and Spotify
While I don't understand nor play DND, the bard (the flute?) Is the best.
From a DM's perspective, this is accurate and basically why my idea for what will happen is always thrown out the window at first contact.
Always loot bodies in D&D, because dead bodies don't always stay dead.
How do I like a video twice
I shall listen to this on repeat in order to properly harness the ability to play a chaotic bard
That's one hell of a flute
So, when can we vote for this to be in the Hottest 100?
took me a few watches to realize that the flute hes playing is just a drum stick.
God that's the most Aussie D&D song I've heard in years. -.- A.G.
D&D aside; this is so accurate to what every flutist I've ever known is like...
lvl 2 bard 20 wisdom 6 intelligence be like:
Oi Tommy- if you're ever feeling down at all you should check out some of the art covers of this one. Instant mood lifter for me (as is the original). K byee.
Lets go meta in this: The fact that Tom realizes the short figure is a child before the DM reveals it means that this situation has happenned before...
Every time I watch this, I can't help but dance along in the same chaotic way Tom does!
Most accurate internet bard i have ever seen in my life😂😂
At this moment, this has ~2.9 million views, and I think I am, by a modest estimate, 1.9 million of them.
no one plays a drum stick flute like Tom Cardy
I definitely roll a 1 on my perception check cuz i have rewatched this many times and never noticed thats not a flute but a drum stick till someone mention it to me
I can see a Zombie playing as a human bard while insulting a small blue child during this. Ollie's influence is LEGENDARY!
Through context this isn't the first child he has murdered
Still waiting for this on spotify
The “BITCH” at the end made this song perfect
silly question, but what instrument is that the tom's bard plays? is it simply called a wooden flute?
Cheese Knees
The only thing I have a problem with in this video is that Vicious Mockery is a saving throw and not a roll to hit
I need a full version of this oml
If I'm not mistaken, you don't roll to cast Vicious mockery, right?
Howard Moon, is that you?
Can we get this as a full song I mean I know it’s almost 2 minutes, but like I almost wanna see an entire album based around this DND game
absolute perfection
This has become my new infinite loop song
This song is one of the greatest three act plays I’ve ever witnessed
Please make a song for every class! My Pathfinder and DnD groups love this!!!❤❤❤
I want a full series of songs about this bard. It's my new dream.
TikTok brought me here
Please give us a longer version of this! Or a sequel. I cant stop jamming
I need this on every music streaming app ASAP. Thanks.
ohmahgawd I cannot stop listening to this it's just such an incredible fucking bop
My boys are otherwise engaged 😂😂
Looting the body was not the first thing I thought of I genuinely thought he’d cast speak with dead but it’s far funnier to imagine Tom looking a kid who he made head pop
Is this on Spotify?
Ill probably never meet him so I just want him to know that he is amazing and keep up the amazing work👍🫶💯🫰 You v always m Ake VB me laugh.  😂
I wish I could meet him
His songs are amazing
I lov tom cardy he is my music idol
I love this song not just because it is hilarious but also because I have done the short thing one of our party members was cursed to be 3 feet tall and then he betrayed us. I was sent to retrieve him for the police after he burned down a hospital. During our battle he tried to intimidate my character so I cast vicious mockery and called him a short motherfucker and them proceeded to charm him.
ok so is nobody gonna talk about the twirl at  0:34?
Its funnier that its implied that its not online meaning bro got atleast 4 natural 20's
"Me and my boys are gonna mess you up" "I rolled a 1" "I rolled a 1" "Fuck" This shit is too real.
Tom: "You're short" Kid: *fucking dies*
Finally found it. The original
Stronk Scanlan vibes
Plz finish it too a hole song 😂!!!
This feels so much more than 2 minutes
this song is the only thing holding me together
Longer song please 🥺
Perfect song for Baradun and the Dheads @vldl
This song always raises so many conflicting emotions in me. Because it's a total banger but the bard rolling a d20 for Vicious Mockery physically hurts me.
Some here see a game that has gotten out of hands. I see just a regular game, even tame considering the lack of epic backfire from all those 1s.
I cannot tell you how many times I've watched this
That drumstick spin was immaculate.
Such a very very funny man!
I loved this so much when it first came out... and now that I've played Baldur's Gate, I love it even more 🤣🤣🤣 an absolute masterpiece
PLEASE MAKE A FULL VERSION!!!!!!!! I’ve been listening to this on repeat
Cheese knees.
Is that flute real? Can someone share a link to where I can get one?
This will forever be amazing, I love it so much
Why is this the first time I've noticed he finishes the sentence "it was a child"? 😂
I need this on spotify PLEASE!!!!
Tom is just a bard irl. Like, yes all musicians are but you could actually fuck up a dark elf by calling him a little shit with some sick beats. I- I want this power
This has absolutely no right to go so fucking hard 😂
If a Nat 20 was rolled for the vicious mockery, then the kid made his Wisdom save. I don't understand how he still had his mind melted from it.
I’ve lost count lf how many times I’ve watched this, and i just realized hes not holding some kind of flute but a drumstick 😅
when's this banger dropping on Spotify
Just happend over here someone said :we are leaving are u wrapping things up? he said:no. As a joke and then right after he said that the video said bitch
I...can't...stop...listening...it...
I love this so much. I would listen to an entire album by him that's just about DnD.
That “f*ck” got me laughing 😂
amazing song...but however as a DnD nerd you made 1 error, vicious mockery is not an attack roll, it's a saving throw roll xD but aside that very good
I need a longer version of this song like a full 3 minute song cause it's perfect
JFC I just laughed so hard I thought I was gonna die. Tears down my face, out of breath, coughing fits, look like I'm having a seizure kind of laughing. I stop just long enough to think about the song and start all over again.
I love that this outcome had a 1/3,200,000 chance of occurring. Or the bard is using loaded dice. Honestly, either way it's hilarious.
I've rewatched this more times than what's healty
0:59 - Shrek when he sees Lord Farquad
This is quite simply genius, I'm absolutely crying and I've watched it five times in a row.
ITS A TRENDDD
3d6>d20
Bard theme song
I have watched this 37 times
This video is my favorite thing in the whole world
this keeps getting stuck in my head, not only is it funny and accurate it's just legit a great song
I’m sorry, but the “loot that body” part is my favorite thing of 2023… he is so happy, so excited… the “Im gonna loot that madafakaaaah” part is just unhinged…  I love everything about this 😂
Me and my best friend love to sing this whenever we see eachother almost everyday 😂
I love how Steve, rolling for a hide check, feels so much like a wholesome dad who's trying to figure out a PC/the internet. In general, Steve has such dad vibes. :D Also, the move while singing "I am perceiving you" is just top comedy gold! I wish this song was longer, but I'll take anything I'll get. :D
God we need more DnD themed stuff 😂  "I Rolled a one" "I rolled a one" "Fuck!"  😂😂😂
1:03
Fuckin' "Cheese Knees" in the background. Tom's over here still raising that awareness
Fucking bards yo!! This song slaps tho
I need this on spotify
Besides the murderhobo atitude, that bard is really enjoyabke to have in a party, with his random flute playing and improvised songs every now and then
Stop making me put this on repeat it's too good
This will never not be funny to me. If I ever stop laughing at this, assume I failed by Death Saves.
I like how every player except the bard has a mic. Ironic
That flute twirling is so smooth
I sent this to my friends because I thought it was hilarious, but I they thought I was insulting them for being short😂😭😂
I want Scanlon to cover this song somehow in Vox Machina
Tom cardy...I have been watching this video on loop and I feel guilty for liking this. However, I  also want to know if the bard does more horrible stuff. I need help.
This song made my day. I just can't stop looping it xD
the fact that the bard said "child" the same time as the DM implies that he could have known it was the kid the whole time and still cast vicious mockery because tom likes bullying kids.
Thank you.
the fact that the dm is disapointed when he says perception check means tom does it a lot and the dm knows what hes gonna do exactly
This lives rent free in my head and I can't stop listening to it. It has succeeded its grapple check on my psyche and I refuse to resist.
I humbly request this either be extended or a part 2 be made.   I just need more of this greatness, either way!
What kind of flute he using in rhis video?
This is the funniest video I’ve ever seen
I can not express how much I want this song on Spotify to just jam to it for literal hours 👍♥️ it’s fantastically funny and catchy and just everything. Fantastic
I'm glad to see the video that launched so many fan renditions and animations :) And really this just confirms everyone's opinion of FUCKING bards running around casting seduction on all the monsters and just generally getting into or causing most of the trouble in most parties :)
This is the best Youtube recommendation ive ever gotten
Me and my bois gonna mess u up I rolled a 1 I rolled a 1 *_F U C K_* ☠☠☠☠☠☠
I love the Lizzo vibes of the flute in this 😂❤
My only problem with this song is that vicious mockery is a save spell so he was not supposed to roll a dice for the attack. Though is a great song.
I'm not one to usually comment this, but do you think you'd like to write and release a full version of 'Juggling is cool' from Helluva Boss' last episode? Its such a banger but its soo short! Anyway, amazing work as always!
Love seeing Tom playing himself.
"....and I hate it" is just so unnecessary it takes it from just mockery to vicious
This is the perfect encapsulation of all my dnd campaigns with friends. Never once does things go the way the DM plans and he doesn't rail things to bring it back he just lets things go to shit and it always goes to shit.
It took me way too many repeat viewings to notice "CHEESE KNEES" written on the board in the back.
I love this song sooooo much!
Absolutely beautiful work
The amount of videos this music has inspired is SO FUNNY! I can't stop listening/seeing every video 😂
the flute is going way too hard XD
I've had this on loop all afternoon. It is just too good!
I love this song so much like I wanna buy it  The only criticism I have is that vicious mockery is a save not an attack roll  :P
A challenger for @nobleknightadventures appears.
The only unrealistic part of this song is that a DnD game would get through three in-game days per session.
lol ur so crazy.... someohow your not cringe tho... your hilarious
It took me much longer than necessary to realise he was, in fact, not playing a flute, but one of his drumsticks instead
This is a gem
Could I have another one?
I keep watching this video bc the flute spin makes me fucking drip
do we get a full version?
About seven watchthrus in on this and I just realized he's playing a drumstick like a flute
Please make merch of this. There is so much gold in this song.
the only unrealistic thing is 15 in game days vs 5 real days bc we all know one or two days is stretched so wide
This not being on Spotify yet is a crime 💔
That ending kills me  EVERY  SINGLE  TIME!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wish this was longer I’m so obsessed with it rn lmao
The fact that this isn't one of the ones put up on Spotify absolutely kills me
Please extend this soooooooooooooong
His face when he said "SHORT!" 😆
Omfg this is gold!!!!
Please release this as a full song it slaaaps
Gentle reminder to the fellow nerds saying "Vicious Mockery isn't an attack cantrip," it is in BG3, which is where the dice image he's using comes form.  You're welcome.
Spotify please I beg you  Edit : Thanks !
Dm: dont  Bard:oupsies too late😂😂😂
PLEASE make this into a full song!
I wish I could re-like this video every time I watch it. Playing my bard in bg3 and it's hilarious how many times I've made crazy mini-boss battles end without fighting by  puersuading the boss to kill his minions and then himself. Grand.
1:26 it’s always *WHAT*
I unliked this to re-like it.
Spotify when?
0:43 I rolled a 1 x2 Fuck! XD
I have listened to this so many times and it fills me with such joy every time
I want this on spotify so bad to add to my playlist
I can’t believe I’m on my third rewatch and I just realised he’s holding a drumstick and not a flute
This is how I want to be in campaigns, I haven't done one (bc my friends and I are still setting up our characters) but I'm making my character to this song bc I WANT TO BE THIS CHAOTIC IN GAMEE BC YASSS
He need to make a full music for this because I will listen to it everyday
Literally heard "There's no escaping it" as "So skibidi"
WE FUCKIN GOT THE DND ANTHEM
That’s points for style
This goes so hard for no damn reason 😂😂😂💜💜
This one is such a FUCKING banger I've had it in my head for a month.
There is no best part to this song. It’s ALL the best part. 😂😂😂
There’s a lot to unpack here, but I’ve watched this several times now and “active perception check” has me dying .
The idea that he psychically obliterated a CHILD by calling it short.  The child that was described as only "a little bit shorter" than the others, we assume adults. Bro called a tall kid short and it DESTROYED HIS MIND!
Ok, im multiclasing to bard.
YEA SO...... watched this video like 30 times before i noticed it was a drumstick.....
Day 2 of asking for Juggling Iz Cool  audio.
This is amazingly well done.
why do bards always get the nat 20s tho
I love how this is two non-human actual warriors and the little human musician who's fucking everything up
People underestimate how fun bard is 😂
This does nOT feel like an almost 2 min vid,     more like 10 minutes... of pure joy.
Alt title: "Murder Hobo"
I watched this so many times before I realised something. The moment the DM reveals that it was a "child", the Bard says "child" at exactly the same time.
I have watched this about 600 times since I was shown it yesterday
"Me and the boys are gonna mess ya up! I rolled a one, I rolled a one... FUCK." is possibly the best thing i have ever heard
This is gonna be one of those “on repeat for a week” songs for me isn’t it…I ask on my 5th repeat
The bitch at the end sends me every time XD
is this gonna get on Spotify cus I wanna listen to this all the time lmao.
“How many times have you listened to this?” “Yes”
vicious mockery is a widsom save, so I don't get why he roll to hit hahahah
I LITERALLY watch this everyday since i discovered it, multiple times and its still not enough :D  <3
I have watched this so many times and it is still not enough 😂
Is there any chance we could have this absolutely perfect gem on Spotify? 💕
“Me and the boys gonna mess you up” “I rolled a one” “I rolled a one” *”FUCK”*
Cheese knees?
I know this is probably the full version but I’m greedy and want more just like a loot goblin
Imagine a mod that played this when casting viscous mockery in BG3. Lol
Anyone else watch this several times a week still? Lol
Of course its the fucking human bard that gets the nat 20s XD
DM: this person is slightly shorter than the others.  Bard: I brand you the shortest person who has ever existed.
Is this gonna be on spotify ever?
I've listened to this song so many times, and I still lose it so much at the hard *"BITCH"*
This goes so hard I rolled a 1 trying to believe it.
I'd love to see a similar song about the Will Wheaton Dice Curse. That would be hilarious!
I kinda want a while campaign sung out like this...then put to animation. Then signed for a 6 deason television deal
On the horizon of this forest path, you see a group of dark cloaked figures slowly trudging towards you. What do you do? My half-orc barbarian braces her greathammer and- that's a one Critical fail. Steve, what do you do? Well, I believe in anticipation, my rogue would try and hide behind a tree- okay, I rolled a one That's another critical fail. Tom, what does your human bard do? Active Perception Check ...That's a natural 20 Let's fucking go  I feel it in my fingers I feel it in my toes These muthafuckas mean to harm us And they got to go So come on, get 'em now! You picked the wrong day to fuck around with my Tight crew There's no escaping it I can perceive you Here's what we're gonna do Me and ma boys gonna mess you up  I rolled a one I rolled a one  Fuck My boys are otherwise engaged So I'm gonna bring it all myself  Hey, I forgot, you're supposed to tell me what I see, right? Yes, thank you. Let's just slow it all down a bit. So, you notice that one of the hooded figures is a little shorter- I cast Vicious Mockery, nat 20, let's go  You're a short muthafucka And nobody likes you SHORT! Everybody says "Look how fucking short that guy is" And that stops you from forming meaningful relationships When you were born, everybody thought that you were just a head But then the doctor said "Wait, this stupid muthafuckin' tiny short ass baby got a tiny little itty bitty body and I hate it"  Your attack lands and absolutely shatters the mind of the cloaked figure. Perception check, please Nat 20, let's go! You perceive the figure was so short because it was a CHILD It's always a kid Specifically the child you've been looking for for the last 15 days game time and 5 days of our actual lives Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't know, I'll be better. His body's just lying there, right? Right? Yes...? Don't-  Loot that body Gotta loot that body now Loot that body! Gotta loot that muthafucka! Play my flute when I loot that dead kid's body Bitch
Damn dude. This song slaps harder then the opening of Muppets Treasure Island
I can't find this song on Spotify
Watched this way to many times and added it as a sound on my soundboard for discord calls
This is my new favorite thing
yeah sex is great but can you sing the word motherfucker where the octave spikes during the last three letters
This video brings me immense amounts of the happy chemical so I re-watch it ALOT
This is a masterpiece. When the aliens find our planet 2mil years from now I hope this is the only piece of media that has survived
Spotify pls 🤣🤣🤣
Absolute masterpiece.  I can't stop watching daily.
A murder-hobo bard? That's a new one.
its my fav X) <3
Love it Perfect
YESSSSSSSSSSS!
WHY DID THE BARD SAY "IT'S ALWAYS A CHILD"?!?!?!?! HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE DIED
These comments are awesome
It's so fucking good, keep it up Tom, Nothing but bangers
Tom, we're gonna need you to go ahead and make an entire album about a DnD playthrough from the bard's perspective now pls.
You dont make attack rolls for Vicious Mockery, therefore a Nat 20 roll could never happen.
I've been tainted by that stupid toilet head sfm crap that i cant unhear "skibid"  when he says "theres no escaping it
it took me until now to realize... he's using a drumming stick as a flute.
"Don't " the most relatable part
heavens if possible we need a extended version
i still pray that we get a (somehow) get a full version of this.. or maybe make this a series  ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
Erm… I’ve just had a word and Halsin likes the song but is apoplectic that you killed Thaniel. What the fuck Tom…?
I really like your videos, but F bombing every three seconds makes it significantly less funny. Also it just annoying.
I love that this has just taken over D&D tiktok
How many buffs / perks  does the bard have to roll perfect 20 twice in a row ? ( i don't play dnd).
as a dnd player this makes me laugh so much my eyes get teary
I do agree with him here. Nat 20 sounds a lot better rhan disadvantage on the next roll. And it shows how little it takes to fck the campain up.
Make a full song please this is brilliant!
just found you. this is fire, dont stop.
Could you upload a full version of the Helluva Boss song Juggling Iz Cool please?
This has to be my favourite so far, but man you just keep making them so hilariously good. Thank you 👋👍🎉
I would pay money to play D&D with Tom
I love the song but at 00:52 is a very quiet screeching sound that i only hear in my left ear whats that?
I love this so much 😊❤
Um, Actually VM is a wis safe not an attack roll so you can’t roll a 20
ive watched this video dozens of times now and only just realized he's playing a drumstick, not a flute
that short segment HAS to be a mod for baldur's gate 3- so every time you cast "vicious mockery" you hear this and do a 1turn status of Reduce to the target(ed?) enemy
Perfect title, now Everytime we roll perception this song goes through my head "I feel it in my fingers... These mothafuggers mean to harm us, and they got to go!"
Please release this
Plot twist,  they have silvery barbs and Main character syndrome
it's always a kid 😂😂😂
This is simply one of the best things I have ever seen.
I want the flute music sheet of this !
I see this get animated often, is there a way we can get official permission to make one?
3rd playthrough... Playing as a bard. Finally defeated that devil in the nautiloid. Vicious Mockery was one of the most important spells. That disadvantage on attack made him fail a lot more. Letting the mindflayer blast him time and again.
I could listen to Loot That Body for an hour straight
I fully plan to get “loot that body” as a sound bite to use for my next DND
This is gold.
I think we all need a "Loot that body" vol 2 😂
The way he ends it with "B****" ends so hard you can feel it in his gut. Don't believe me try and mimic it yourself
love that tom is consistently the worst person ever in his music video canon
We need more dnd songs. Our party loves this one lmfao
This masterpiece needs a series of songs lmao
"How many times did you listen this?" Me: yes, also Loot that body!
it couldn't be just me who was wait for him to snap with his toes
IRL Nat 1 Perception Check: I didn't realize he was using a drumstick as a flute until about the 50th view...
*magnificent flute solo* "SHORT!"
When is this coming out on Spotify? I need to listen to this daily for my Dopamine... <3
I been listening to this for the last 5 hours...and its still beautiful
0:58
1:05
so freaking good and hilarious, love it
"Me and my bois are gonna mess you up" "I rolled a 1" x2 "Fuck" All being on rhythm absolutely slays me
TOM CARDY
This is EXACTLY what it's like running a d&d game for middle schoolers.
"Me and my boys are gonna mess you up" "I rolled a one" "I rolled a one" "Fuck" "My boys are otherwise engaged" HAHAHAHAHAHA
BG3 playthrough literally in a nutshell as half evil bard lol
0:37 so skibidi
I've watched this so many times. I'm recommending this to everyone who listens. I've showed this around at work.
Thumbnail looks like Justin Timberlake in The Love Guru.
What always gets me is the pause between “the body is just lying there” and “loot that body” the dm processing what was just said and going NO NO NO DON’t is beautiful 😂
This song keeps popping up on my feed.  Youtube broke in a good way.
Can you release this as a full song
I love this My only issue is that the caster doesn't roll for Vicious Mockery, it's a Save Spell
That flute spin is finesse at its finest. Also the idea of everyone else being helpless in this situation makes it so much better 😅
Wait....if its a nat 20 perception how did he not see that it was the person that they were looking for
What is the name of this song
One of our DnD members sent this to me and my husband and said this would be what our in-game child would be like. Accurate. 😂
im gonna rewatch This daily until i am sick of it
I’ve come back to this video multiple times, and I only just noticed the “flute” is a drumstick. I’m dying 😂
Vicious mockery is a save spell, you dont roll for it, the DM does. A nat 20 would be a failure for it.
A month later and I'm still clicking Play Again
Loot that body...😂
We need a longer version of this  Actually  We need a longer version of everything lmao
Anyone else sing “so skibbity” when he says No escaping it?
I love how he is so confident that the da doesn’t even question a spell attack with vicious mockery
I have been all of these people at one time or another. Butterfingers barbarian, bumblefoot rogue, exasperated DM, and Overachieving Bard.
Love it! Best d&d comedy song sense Roll a D6 dropped onto yt.....oh lord 12 years ago! lol 😆
Tom, we're gonna need some EU-tour dates... Belgium, around my area too please..
This song became a meme at the table and now everytime we do or we find out something bad to a kid or something bad happened to a kid we just reference "it's always kid"
I wish I could like the video every time i watched it.
I love the battle flute so much
He may be a murder-hobo, but he's at least chill enough to play with others before he murderizes a small child
hello from Ifunny
with all them Nat 20s i swear those dice are loaded
Tom:  I guess we're all just going to ignore "Cheese Knees"?
The most underrated moment for me is that split-second bit of visual acting where the DM realizes the bard is about to loot the child's corpse, and there's a flash of realization/horror followed immediately by bracing/resignation.
If I can get a music sheet from someone experienced in the flute sections, I'd really appreciate it. I tried some music to mp3 sheet music apps but they are inaccurate.
This is so goddamn funny
The very first toot from the bard just kills me every time. How you managed to translate "I'm about rain absolute chaos because I'm unbearably bored" into one rbf and a single recorder note is beyond me, but it's comedy gold.
I like how the other players don’t look annoyed or upset that the kid/npc they were looking for died, they just look like they’re in shock/confused.
I play a bard in our campaign, and I'm totally gonna use his Vicious Mockery insult sometime, oh my gosh. 😂
Can we appreciate the fact that in universe, these 2 other guys walking with the kid watch a group of 3 people seeming to come up to them, 2 of them out of commission for whatever reason, and then one dickhead with a flute steps forward, sings about how they’re gonna mess them up, notices the kid and proceeds to diss how short he is until the kid dies, then loot his body. Like, they just watch the whole thing happen, and not say a word.
This fucking slaps
When he yelled "short!" That was personal wasn't it buddy that face don't lie lmao 😂
please, please, please, don't tell me I'm the only idiot who thought Tom was actually blowing a flute this whole time and not a drumstick...right?
this dnd section is wild!!!!
1:00 you're welcome.
This is the best video on the internet!
Just nothing compares to this
Esto es arte
Every group has one (and sometimes five)
fk me Tom this SHLAPSSSSSS
Блин,  я всё ещё не могу перестать думать о том,  какие серёжки он носит ~  Каждое видео на них смотрю 😅  *Том как всегда крут,  песня прекрасна, надеюсь, когда-нибудь будет полная версия)
Please make this longer, a full D&D scene
Watching this while office is being on baclground
Every line in this is comedy gold.  My personal favourites: “I can perceive you” “My boys are otherwise engaged”
So this song was very fun at first but then I realized that the super short sound that my steam deck makes when I open the current game details menu is kind of similar to the first note of the song, so basically every time I sit down for a gaming sesh, the song just sets off in my head by this one sound effect. I said it was fun at first but actually now it's 100x times funnier
"there was a slight confusion between perception and insight check" the song.
The fact that this isn't on Spotify is a sin.
SHORT!!!
what roll did the orc fail?
I need more of this please😂😂
I wish I could like things multiple times just over and over again.  10 outta 10
the instrumentalnis jaunty as hell i love it
Haters will say he uses a drumstick as a flute, but Tom is actually pushing the envelope here!
I'm addicted to this song.
Can you imagine actually playing dnd with Tom cardy as a bard 😂😂
I discovered this song and channel through a fan animation of a lovable zombie with a complex about her chest playing DnD with Death herself (who is also best girl). I am so glad that I did.
Y’know, on a twenty perception, the DM could’ve specified that the child doesn’t mean to harm him.
I'm in pure awe of how this vid is so perfectly done
Despite not understanding DnD at all, this is golden in every way. Mesmerising beats, funny lyrics, and i understood all DnD stuff there. GOOD STUFF
I didn't notice it the first few times watching it but I realized that the Dungeon Master looks a bit excited and he leaned in a bit when he was about to reveal the first perception check. I think that he was hoping the team would realize that it was the child they're looking for and had something special planned for the encounter before the bard ruined everything lol
I just realized the barbarian and rouge rolled their own dice but the bard was so chill the dm rolled for him the first time
Can we please have a sequel? This is so fucking awesome and funny! And I don't even play Dungeons and Dragons! 😂😂😂
This needs to be a series
This song is dangerous because every time I listen to it I laugh so hard I can't breathe and my head gets all fuzzy and I might suffocate.  10/10 would risk hypoxia again.
Is there a purely instrumental version anywhere? The beat is so damn good!  The song is just perfect, but the music on its own is so just so perfect too.
I would watch a whole musical of this adventuring party.
hey thank you Tom, no matter what is going on watching some of your videos/listening to some of your songs always brightens my day a bit. again thank you
I AM CRYING.  I CANNOT STOP MY TEARS AND I CANNOT BREATHE.  MY RIBS HURT AND MY CHEEKS ARE SORE FROM LAUGHING.  WHO THE FUCK CAST TASHA'S HIDEOUS LAUGHTER??  I WANT NAMES.
The new bo Burnham?
the beat drop on this part "yes? …DoN'T—" "LOOT THAT BODEY•*¨*•.¸¸♪♫•*¨*•.¸¸♪" is endlessly hilarious to me
This is so fucking funny and somehow has only gotten funnier with time
Sir thank you for this piece of art. My girls (10, 7 and 5, non English speaking) have demanded it at least once daily and can sing along pretty accurately, dance a little choreography to it, and their English is making leaps and bounds!
Me playing Bg3
I can't stop listening to that
I've heard tom cardy thru random playlists that music app thought id enjoy ...they were right and 1st ive seen this dude
on spotify when?
So much like Flight of the Concords
Can we get more with the bard in D&D?? I like this character😂
this song is a work of art, but also... are we just not gonna talk about the whiteboard in the background that says "Cheese Knees"?
🤓 Well actually Vicious Mockery requires the target to make a wisdom saving throw, so the child should have rolled a 1 rather than the Bard rolling a d20
this has very strong flight of the conchords energy and I love it so much
I love how he only asks what he sees just so he can have some fodder for vicious mockery
What is this type of flute, im obsessed with the smooth high pitch it has
I’m here from Olivia killing Kobo with vicious mockery
As both the DM and the bard this is great Cause I still wanted to join in on the fun but with out actually helping the team. In fact she is constantly being more of a problem to them than anything
Will this ever be on ITunes? I wanna buy it on there
To all the people saying you can't nat 20 on vicious mockery: you'll need to take that up with the dungeon master.
Someone please put hololive animation of this on here so I can watch it on repeat.
As a DM this is horrifically accurate , even though they do have ungodly high rolls sometimes 😭
How do you do this without cracking up laughing?
"I cast viscous mockery. Nat20 LETS GO!"  💀
This is gonna be the first song at my wedding
😂 Loot that Body!! Why is this every group i ever DM for
I wish there was a full version
My dude, we need apparel of Perception Check asap so I can order it for my husbando (for Xmas). Someone commission some rad DnD art for Tom and make this happen lol.
Full song please thank you
"It's always a kid." HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU DONE IT!?
This is such a legit bop
Excellent
Why is this sooo good
So this is what Charlie's grandpa has been up to all these years
Hilarious
The fact the Bard already anticipated the DM saying Child when they both said it at the same time is hilarious.
What an absolute fucking HEATER. Somebody get this man an award.
haha 4e represent!  Nat 20 on vicious mockery.  Max damage.  Let's go!
Aw bro there’s no iTunes copy I wanted to buy a copy to listen to at work.  And I’m 5’5”
Do people actually not notice that he's playing a drumstick and not a flute? Like, come on, y'all! Pay more attention!
omfg this is the funniest thing ive seen in a long time
Song is such a banger that you don't even notice he's playing a drumstick.
Listening to this song has become a daily ritual almost. It’s perfection!
This got me into Dragon Friends, and after a season and a half I'm pretty sure this video is a tribute to Michael Hing being trigger happy and having zero guilt about it
the murder hobo theme song. i love it
The thing is, with that 20 perception, the DM would probably have told him it was the child they were looking for.
There's so much good in this, but the two that stand out are  "My boys are otherwise engaged" because it's hilarious  And "I cast Vicious Mockery Nat 20 let's go" because Vicious Mockery doesn't require an attack roll but that's *exactly* what everyone that casts that spell does before the DM says "hang on, it's a save, your Nat 20 means nothing"  Keep up the good work Tommy boy
Spotify PLEASE
Can I pleeeeaaase have the flute sheet music? Pretty pleeease?
I love this so much, CANT STOP LISTENING atleast half of the 2.1 milion views are mine xD Im addicted its so funny and it is an absolute jam, on top of that love the clip and the facial expresions Absolutely satisfying to watch this in every regard  Just 1 issue I had to point out  You dont roll for vicious mockery xD SORRY CANT HELP IT ... the enemy roles and if they roll a 20 then it fails ofcourse and they take no damage...  probably 10000000 people already said this  Eitherway love it, it fits with the nerative so its fine  Love it keep doing what you do this one is amazing <3
0:37 i hear nothing other than "so skibidi."
SHORT!
I'm gunna need you to make an entire album based on this group and their adventures now.   K? Thx.
Not one comment asks if Vicious Mockery is a save or attack roll.
I have watched this an unhealthy amount of times, and I laughed just as hard as the first time
I have this exact same energy. especially cause im also aussie and I just sound like this
You don't roll for Vicious Mockery yourself, that's Wisdom Saving Throw made by the target x)
I watched like 8 different animated versions of this and it just doesn't get old
"A child" "It's always a kid"  He's done this before 😂
I realized just now that the bard didn't even listen to the game properly until it was his turn (he didn't know that they rolled 1s) :D
the only problem with this video is vicous mockery is a saving throw spell not a to hit spell....
Because of this song, the urge (heh) to play BG3 with a Dark Urge Human Bard named Thom Kardi is incredibly overpowering.
the other two players roll their own dice, but the dm rolls toms… meaning that tom has gotten so many fucking nat 20s that the dm has started rolling for him… and is still getting nat 20s
I don’t know why but the “lets fucking go” after the first Nat 20 is the most realistic reaction to a Nat 20
I CANT STOP WATCHING!! I MUST HAVE MORE !!!
Its the "bitch" at the end for me 😂
Sending this to my friends as it identically described by bard characters in our last campaign  Amazing!
ive watched this at least twice a day since finding it... five days ago. usually more than twice if im being honest.
i roll into here frankly 10 times every day, I can't get enough of it
I need more from this badass bard character.
Please make a cd
This is such an ABSOLUTE BANGER of a song! Also, hilarious to the point of making my stomach hurt! Genius!
AMAZING
AAAA HHEHEE. YEES
Xenoblade 3 should’ve started this way, with Mio viciously flexing on Noah’s height while playing the flute  …even though she’s shorter than him
We've reached maximum evolution. Nowhere to go from here
Tootlie ootlie ootlie ooo SHORT
THE BEST DND SONG EVER
does anyone else want a full version of this to listen to while in a campaign?
I immediately cast revivify
the amount of times i have rewached this . its just soo catchy
This videos reminds me of the time while me and my friends were playing DnD we had this annoying short guy we were supposed to protect so I rolled to punt him like a an American football and got a 20. My friends were not happy with me but I didn’t care because I was laughing uncontrollably.
To be fair the kid was supposedly intending to harm them
Killing a child with magical mockery and then looting their body is an odd way to prove you're not a cop, but ok.
Any chance this masterpiece will be released on Spotify?
Vicious mockery is a saving throw, not an attack roll. You dont roll a d20 to hit
The most meta thing about all of this is the actual human bard melting all our brains with a song after rolling a nat 20
This has been stuck in my head for the last three days
Dm: ok so you see something peeking out of the ditch Me, playing what is essentially a home brew purpleblood troll a la homestuck: roll to chuckle voodoo it’s brains out  My DM: OR. or. You could ask what it is  Me: oh yeah right what is it  *and then it’s a normal ass npc also fighting the evil Orb Monster*
Tom is actually physically hot lol
Is nobody talking about how HILARIOUS TC pronounced the mutha7ka im dyiny
0:46 f u c k
I've watched this video 4 times today and I still can't stop laughing
That feel when you keep coming back every day to check if there's a full length version yet but still happy this exists and replay the song at least 3 times every day.
That 1d4 psyc dmg is Godly useful
RENT. FREE.
WE NEED AN EXTENDED VERSION!
we need more dnd stuff that was amazing <3 i love this lol
any way to buy this? I want that for my car...
Love the beat man, everything about this song is just perfect.
this may be the greatest video ever made, i have seen this probably 50 times. this deserves 100,000,000,000 views ez
Actually, Bard's don't get vicous mockery
Tbh I think the DM is partially to blame here. The Bard rolled a Nat20 on Perception and the DM’s response was “you notice that one of the hooded figures is a little shorter” which would be a fair clue for a roll of 10-15, but for a 20 he should really be like “yeah so you see that one of them is that kid you’ve been looking for gg”. DM should know his players better.
I’ve watched this more times than I care to admit.
Me and my boys are gonna mess you up
Cheese knees 🧀
There need to be a Baldur's Gate 3 Mod that replaces the Vicious Mockery's sound clips with clips from this song.
I senth this both to my D&D party and my gf who knows nothing about D&D and everyone died laughing like the child
I think i did a nat 1 or maybe it could be consider a nat 20 because i am in an infinite loop listening this !
It has been 1 month. Now we need full version plz
Can you post a 10 hour version of this? thaaaanks
POV: reasons why the Bard is the best class. Also, on a slightly related note, in the movie Dungeons and Dragons, if you look closely, Chris Pine’s lute is padded on the back where he hits people
PLEASE animate this
This song is unironically fantastic
My party’s Bard rolled 3 nat 20s in a row, the first being an active perception check. Needless to say everyone in the campaign knows this video now.
that B#$ch at the end was hillarious
So basically, this muthafickin Bard had Karmic Dice.
I'm going to jail I laughed so hard.
The initial flute sound has been repeating in my head since the first time I heard this song
What... what the fuck are "cheese knees?"
Hottest track of 2023 😂
I bought a flute because of this skit. I want to get really good and actually play this character in DND.
It's probably one of the best songs i have heard in a while
Clicked this thinking it was Pedro Pascal, didn't expect this Mighty Boosh nonsense.  Fun though.
toot
That cut to "loot that body" is so catchy and hilarious!
I really need to know all about Tom's BG3 character now
I so very much need an extended 5 min version, just, just do the whole campaign, the adventures of the human bird, same jizz pls
this song lives in my head rent free
I mean...  this is the best thing on youtube for the year.
I’ve watched this like thirty times now. I discovered the song about 4 hours ago. There’s actually a great animation for this song by lanky mf. Also really good. I’ve listened to others songs like red flags which is most popular, the Tolkien one is good, the Jurassic park one is funny, the flirting with your dad one is good but this is hands down imo the best. Fackin love this shiz
Bestie and I just started playing BG3 and last time we chatted to catch up, we both admitted the "loot that body" part of this song is stuck in our heads while we loot~eroo.
love how as the DM reveals the short figure was a child, the bard realizes and says it at the same time, indicating that he knew on some level this was a possibility but fuckin attacked them anyway
This sounds like something out of a whimsical DND musical movie.
LankyMF personified this beaut real well
I so wish to be a fly on the wall to watch this masterpiece come together. Bravo
This is utterly brilliant. Lol there's so much IYKYK in there.
This is the comment to ask for a full version.
Tom capture the fun of D&D so GOOD!!! More D&D plz!!!!
My hope is that this lands on spotify
We need a full three and a half minute song of this.
The end hit and, after I stopped laughing, I wondered "when's the full version coming out?"
That "rolled a 1. Rolled a 1. Fuck" part will NEVER  make me not laugh. I can't get over it it's just so perfectly describes games with RNG!
Legend says whenever Tom Cardy tha bard is near a flute (or a good enough drusmtick) this song starts playing
Glenn Close be like
He's so powerful he made the saving throw spell into an attack roll spell
The comedic timing has succesfully shatteres my ribs
My fantasy goal is to make a song like this in hiphop form, an ode to dnd experiences. Love this
But the caster of vicious mockery wouldn't roll to hit, it forces the target to make a wisdom saving throw (so the target rolls the d20, not the caster). Therefor a nat 20 would be very good for the child.
perfection
As an avid player of DND, this is pretty accurate
y'know what maybe this DnD stuff ain't so bad
"Cheese knees" in the background XD
YO TOM! This bop is SO DAMN HOT.
i fucking love that the part where he just shouts "SHORT!" at 00:57 is the most replayed bit of the video because honestly same lmao
Can't stop watching when this comes up in my feed, funny every time 😂
This was stuck in my head all day and now its on my stream playlist. Also LOVE the new collab with BDG!! I was just thinking about how epic it would be if y'all made something together.
Highlight 1; that flute spin... that's just showing off. 😁 highlight 2; "I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1... (dramatic pause) FUCK!" 🤣
But... vicious mockery is a saving throw, you don't roll for that q-q
How did Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie ever make a kid together, that's the big question this video raises.
listen to this song too many times and cant stop
I might be 200,000 of these views
This is what chaotic evil is, more campaigns need this.
My favrioute detail is at 1:25 you can see Bardy say child at the same time as the DM.   This has happened before and he realises it.
I can't wait for the official video for the full version.
"It's always a kid." kills me every time.
Absolute perfection.  Can't stop watching a month later
why have i listened to this so many times.... it is.... perfect
This was so close to being epic, but vicious mockery is a saving throw spell.  The bard doesn't roll to hit with it shorty rolls a save and would have gotten that nat 20 asking the bard if, you know after the nasty divorce if his parents would still be brother and sister.
LOOT THAT BODY! It is really an unexpected and hilarious twist in the song.😂😂😂
Once, my players were looking for a cave that had a monster in it. A character led them to the cave, and mentioned how his dog liked walking in caves. Few minutes later, they trip over something furry, and are like "it's a bear!! Kill it" So they kill it. It was not a bear. It was the dog.
i want to jam to this while walking through my workspace omgg
Commenting for algorithm
I think this is literally my new favourite song
I can't stop rewatching this. Help me
This is the way that I want to tell people about how my day went.
“Let’s fucking go”
I just watched this 10 consecutive times. I want the algorithm to deliver more content such as this!
"I rolled a 1" "I rolled a 1" I'm glad the boys from business man have other hobbies
I now need to learn how to play d&d so I can do this
I just failed 4 perception checks in the Temple of Bhaal and got lit up lol
The Bard seems to be channeling the spirit of the great Rudy Ray Moore...BITCH!
When I'm having a bad day I come here and listen to this song. Always makes me laugh 😂
I thought he was gonna go full necromancy, cause if I remember correct from my short time as a Dnd bard, bards can learn that shit like surprisingly easily.
This is one of my favorite videos on the internet right now. It’s just…it scratches every single neuron in my brain.
Thats...... Ye ah thats exactly how random dnd encounters go tbh everybody either rolls shit or acts like an idiot
the fact that this is literally every bard pc 😭😭😭
Major scanlan vibes
Started a new campaign with multiplayer for the first time in BG3, and casting vicious mockery was the FIRST thing I did
This is just every end campaign as a song
1:00
His absolute and utter trust in the rest of the party is so fuckin cute
LOOT THAT BODY-
The short attacks and "Loot that body" will be used in Tiktoks for a couple meme years at least.
Need more dnd !!!🎉😂😂
I hope that in the extended version, the bard is just going around mocking people while also looting their body in the most catchy and interesting ways possible.
"I rolled a 1","I rolled a 1"..."F*ck"  *flute sound*
Please make more like this
With the Cheese Knees = Bad poster in the background, I like to think there's a continuity between his releases. One day we'll get smokin' joe rudeboy and the bard from perception check battling middle finger to flute
But what happened to the other cloaked figures? :P
After watching this nearly 30 time, I just realized that Tom's Bard says "Child" the same time that the DM does and that is absolutely my favorite part now
So you guys know Glenn Close of Dungeons and Daddies...?
Loot that muthafucKAA! 😂😂
I fucking love this banger.
You look huge tom! Good looks good looks.  Whole thing is hilarious,  seen so many people animating it
I thought vicious mockery was a wisdom save? How does he roll a 20 to hit lmao?
Alright, who reclassed Astarion into a Bard? 😒
I was playing BG3 with some friends today and could hear one of my them singing under his breath "loot that body"  over and over as we cleared an area. 10/10
the fact that dm is so done and the bard anticipates him saying it's a child means this is not the first or even second time the bard has fucked something like this up
Him calling the dead kid a bitch at the end sends me lmfao!
I have been listening to this on repeat for the last week; it's so good!
* the best flute solo you've ever heard * B I T C H.
need a full song/ballad of this!
This is so fucking funny for no reason-
The SHORT scream gets me every single time
Dm: One of the cloaked figures is shorter- Tom: * Murder hoboness increases *
This is just a failure on the DMs part for not making it clear that the cloaked figures where unarmed, and didn’t mean to do harm.
When I eventually find the time to play baldurs gate 3. I'm going to be a bard called cardy.  Loot that body bitch!
When is this hitting Spotify, seriously? LMAO
This is the only thing that has brought me any joy in the past week. Thank you.
my favorite part of this (as a D&D nerd) is that Vicious Mockery doesn't require an attack roll on your end, it requires the target to make a saving throw.  I bring this up bc it just lends more credence to the fact that Tom's character is so wrapped up in his own awesomeness that he doesn't realize that nat 20 means NOTHING.  10/10, amazing song as always.
I love this so much !
One guy in my dnd group sent this to our group chat and no one could breath
Only in DnD could you call someone short so hard that they fuckin die
I like how other two figures saw all of this and probably decided to GTFO of there.
Dear god this is so good tom
There will never be a better DnD song. Change my mind
every time i link someone to this video i watch it again and it's a complete mood uplifter. thanks tom
Is it sad I could see astarion performing the whole interaction?
can confirm that this is a GOOD day with the party. On a bad day they argue, blow up a city, and then fall asleep at a pub and wake up in the sewers...
Never thought i would laugh so hard at the sentence "play my flute while i loot that dead kids body"
I need to stop watching this and forget about this man if I wanna properly continue my life. Stg if I wasn't out of the closet, this would make me.
The timing in this is everything. I love how in the same breath he goes from "I'll be better" to "so the body's just lying there, right?" Which is kind of the opposite of the foregone promise.
I really hope this makes it in the next album ❤
1:43 The passion and the high pitch-ness of this bit is (bardic) inspirational! 🏆🥂
I've watched this so many times, why am I just now realizing that's a drumstick? lol
I've uh... I've watched this video countless times. It's just so good. I'm still not tired of watching it, I just start to feel like I shouldn't. What's that about.
I need more comedic songs with a flute i didn't know i needed this till now
"My boys are otherwise engaged" gets me everytime
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease release this as a single. Please. I sing it like 5 times a day.
Major FotC / Mighty Boosh vibes and I love it.
Tom Cardy is a problem player confirmed
came from red flags so glad i stayed for good shit like this
The vicious mockery killing that child, to me implies that the bard was either level 5 or even 11, which makes it all the more funny
As someone who is pretty prone to a rogue/bard/assassin life, I can say I fully support this mocking, disparaging, insulting, belittling, besmirching, defaming song.
i found this song being used for a mlp fan video, the other day that sounded EXACTLY like a tom cardy song but in Chinese: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AizSC7VNaPA&lc=Ugzkk156KIaGZqeP7hx4AaABAg and THEN YOU DO A DnD song with kinda the same premise and punchline XD
We are gonna need a full length version of this going through a whole set of rolls.
Someone needs to check this guy's dice...
I am watching this on fucking repeat
Spotify version when?
I love the Cheese Knees in the background
Soooooo I like JUST rolled a bard for a session a friend wrote that's a coming of age story so we're all playing teenagers, so this feels so inspiring right now lmfao
That dance and smile when it jumps to "Loot that body!" kills me
I can't stop watching this
please please PLEASE! we need a full song of this, this short version already has more views the whole "Ballad of Smokin' Joe Rudeboy" and "level clear", two other masterpieces of yours   Please, bless us with a full version of this song, heed the pleading of your followers
Tom Cardy is a fucking god in music.
this is the new anthem of my dnd campaign
as a bard in dnd, i can confirm this is EXACTLY what we do.
I can't help but to watch this video multiple times a day!
This is my D&D experience. My husband never waits and is a loot monster.
I want a long version of it !
The most unrealistic part of this whole thing is that they managed to get through 15 days game time in 5 sessions.
I sing the “loot that body” bit every time I loot people in bg3
Is this going to be on Spotify at any point? 😁
When i indefinitely start playing DnD, i am gonna take the last few second of the audio in this video, then make a "loot that body button"
Um actually you don’t roll for vicious mockery, it forces a wisdom saving throw 🤓
How has this not been in my feed its starts eith such OLD GREG energy
This would be perfect if you hadn't messed up vicious mockery... The caster of that doesn't roll a d20, the victim does,  and on a nat 20 they would take 0 damage
full song version plz
I need this on Spotify yesterday!
How is this a better song than most of the entire Billboard Top 40?  And with better lyrics too?
MORE!!
HUUUUUUUUUGE Howard Moon energy and I am 💯 here for it
Congratulations on being stuck in my head for three straight weeks
Bro the face made by the guy at 1:29 kills me every time, idk why.
when tom yells "SHORT!" i laughed so goddamn hard, i need to make that my ringtone
Wait at 0:45 did they roll a 1 again in that exact moment or was the bard really not paying attention and they have to painstakingly remind the bard that they both rolled a 1 beforehand? Either way it’s hilarious.
i like how he rolled a nat 20 on a perception check but the dm didn’t let him know the short guy was a child
icon behavior
Is it bad if this song randomly gets stuck in my head and I have the urge to sing it in public? XD
so for his action he did an active perception check...  so he shouldn't have another action to use vicious mockery... unless he's hasted or something   was that even combat? there were no initiative rolls.
The biggest failed perception check is not realizing he’s playing a drumstick until you read the comments.
We need a extended version
I love Vicious Mockery, but I never get anywhere with it. WIS somehow never fails in BG3. Sacred Flame either decimates or fizzles and often it's the latter. maybe a mod makes it work.
Markus Velafi
every couple days this video shows up on my homepage feed and i always feel compelled to click it. 2 weeks in of this and im still not tired of it, what is this sorcery?
LOOT THAT BODY!
WHERE'S THE LINK TO THE PODCAST TOM
I am absolutely fucking obsessed with this song. I have to play it at least once daily or i break out into hives i swear
You don't roll for attack on Vicious mockery but i know the DM just allowed because he is angry with that bard.
does anyone else get flight of the concords vibes from tom?
This may be the best video I have ever seen in my life and I come back to it daily when I need a pick me up. The cadence is just perfect. Tom Cardy you are a gift to all mankind, please make more videos like this one.
This is the pure distillation of DnD
Girls- body shaming is never OK  Also girls when they see a guy under 6ft- 1:00
I really like the  "it's always a kid" meaning it's not the first time he's done this XD
I have diffuculty expressing how fucking awesome this is! Bard is the best class evah! ♥🎵🎶
"when the Bard turns out to be the Murder Hobo"
The way he sings "gonna loot that muthafukka" always makes me laugh, and I don't know why. XD
I'm absolutely in love with the replay button
The fact that this song still isn’t on Spotify is a *crime.* It lives rent free in my brain.
that flute beat tho
– Me and ma boys gonna mess you up! – I rolled a 1. – I rolled a 1. – Fuck! *doot* 😂😂😂
Im invested. I need to know what happens in the rest of this campaign lmao
This is the most powerful Bard my eyes and ears have ever perceived! 'Perception check failed'
Masterpiece.  The "BITCH" at the end kills me everytimes. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tom looks the absolutely happiest when he's gonna "loot that body" and his smile is contagious.
Someone needs to check that bards d20
Everyone is so distracted by how good the song is nobody noticed he rolled 3 natural 20's in a row, which is extremely unlikely
The best example of Aussie humour
Definitely found a new favorite artist
I love how many people are animating this one, theyre all great
DM: “you enter the cave and encounter the dragon-“ Tom: “Roll to seduce, Nat. 20 let’s fuckin’ go.”     edit: I want this on Amazon music so much 😭
I want to leanr the flute just so i can do this in DND
honestly if the central quest npc was felled by a nat 20 viscious mockery thats on the fuckin dm
I play a Bard in Baldur's Gate 3 with a group of friends and this is so accurate.
This is basically our party's anthem now and every now and then me and my husband will sing "loot that body" and laugh. 😂😂 If you made a whole album called Bard Jams, I would buy that album. 😂😂
Somebody asked Tom "How would you like to do this?" And he chose Song.
when do it get on spotify
I want this to be a full song ;-; it's so good
"I play my flute while I loot that dead kids body" This killed me
Tom, you rolled a nat 20 on this song! I just keeps getting funnier... How is that possible!
We need a longer version with the flute tune ^^
i can't stop listening to this i'm sorry i can't stop
The part that killed me was “loot that body!”😂
Everything about this is so perfect from the one flute sound at the start to the perfectly delivered 'bitch' at the end
If Flight of the Concords played D&D
Stumbled upon this yesterday. I've lost track of how many times I've listened to it since then. I'm gonna need a full length song now.
This guy and this song gives strong Old Gregg vibes
How are there no comments about Vicious Mockery not using an attack roll, but a saving throw? I feel like im going crazy
Should be on Eurovision
Isnt vicious mockery a wisdom saving throw? I dont think you can crit on it
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE FOREST WITH THIS ONE BOYS!
My brother plays bard in his DnD campaigns. He does stupid shit like this all the time. It's fucking hilarious.
Instantly skip remorse and go to looting. ACCURATE.
Love this song so much and the expressions from the GM and other placers is perfect.  I've had "loot that body" stuck in my head 😂
"It's always a kid".......I'm sorry but that DM should have learned after the first time
Been playing balders gate 3 with a friend and he is indeed that kind of bard xD
I love that the flute is just a drumstick
I was not prepared for the ending 😂
Thats just me with every DnD game, where i just MUST do a game breaking action.
As someone who plays dnd, i can say the last part is totally accurate.  We always racing trying to be the first to loot the body.
The funniest part has to be that vicious mockery is a wisdom save and not an attack roll
Judge! Vicious Mockery isn't an attack roll, it's a wisdom save by whomever you're attacking
Three Nat20s in a row? How rigged is that dice? XD
I vow to always announce my natural 20s by saying, "nat 20, let's go".
I'm going to be playing this daily until your tight crew recovers from the 1's
It’s incredibly accurate, the bard always hits the nat 20
Epic
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched this on Instagram and now here we are
I didn't realize that wasn't a flute for an embarrassingly long amount of time
please, please, please do more dnd ones!!!!
This beat is a banger
Beautiful ❤
there's always that one bloke who plays a bard with 500% effort lol
I like to think that Tom just plays as himself at D&D.
It's so obvious that Tom is the problem player
HAHA the fucking Scanlan be like:
LOOT THAT BODY!!!
I watch this multiple times daily...
Probably my favourite out of all your songs somehow
I'm under the weather right now and giggling at this is doing far more for me than the pain meds are. You're such a gift.
This is exactly me as a bard
OMG This is so good. Cant wait to see more about D&D and Baldurs Gates
I love how Tom says "It's always a kid" implying this has, in fact, happened before.
I would love a longer version of this, it's just-so perfect, I'm vibe hard with it.
Play my flute While I loot That dead kid's body  Fricking Shakespeare
God if this isn't the dnd experience i don't know what is honestly
Tags : perception mindbreak flute
This is just so catchy
Thank you for making me laugh this hard 😂
I can't stop watching this!!😱
I. Just. Can’t. Stop. Watching. This!!!!
One of the truest likes I left on a video ever
I LOVE YOUR BASS VOICE
It took me two weeks to notice the "flute" is a drumstick lol Grandma was right, I'm not the sharpest knife in the kitchen
I don’t know if someone noticed this, but there were a group of hooded figures…… Meaning the bard instant killed the child and proceeded to run into the unknown group to loot his corpse. Meaning he’s going to be immediately surrounded. Classic bard!
The beat dropping back in to "loot that body" gets me every time.  It's just perfect.
Glorious.
Chaotic neutral bard be like
Sir, will you come to PAX next year?  I think people will enjoy your presence there.
Its just soo good 🤣
this is so damn catchy, I keep coming back to this between playing bg3
please tell me it's on ytmusic
You loot the body. You find 1 lvl3 Monster Truck
This is the kind of video I wish I could upvote twice.
Aw man this makes me miss d&d
☠️
My man, I love your stuff as is. You are a music god.   But this shit right here is perfection made manifest.  I've probably watched this video 20 times by now.
Spotify when? ❤
😂
The times i played this is getting unhealthy 😅😅😅
The Lil feet stomps as he plays his flute while looting that dead kids body.. M
A masterpiece beyond masterpeices.
This literally reminds me of my party dice rolls, one is always nat 20 and pulling the group through
please release this song.  I will listen to it every day for the rest of my life
I will now be singing “Loot that body” every single time I loot any enemy in any game ever forever. Thanks, Tom the Bard
Um actually, visious mockery is a saving throw for the target. (I need to get a life)
Next time I destroy that grove, this will play on repeat in the background until I find the kids' corpses 😂
This song is 110% pure fun~
It's mesmerizing. I think I've watched it 10 times already.
Chaotic I-don't-care-so-long-as-it's-funny
this is every DnD campaign ever
This is so catchy I feel like this could be a famous pop song if the lyrics were about love or being young forever or whatever.
I’ve watched this dozens of times. And, intellectually, I know he’s saying “there’s no escaping it,” but I can only ever hear “so skippity”
a song could just be this and people will still say its about drugs
I love how you faked the dms realization when he says: yes, don't, then immediatily rsigns himself to it before even hearing it. I was rolling at that point
I like that he uses a drumstick as a flute
Please make more Dungeons and Dragons themed content. You are so good at it. Your music is amazing in general but you seriously GET IT on this topic.
Wait he's also getting into dnd now too?
Average Baldur’s Gate 3 playthrough
Hey, when is this song coming to spotify? My wife wants to jam to it in the car.
this video alone can get me into dnd goddammit
Jus the greatest thing ive seen! This cured my ADHD!
I think my favorite part is the rogue looking at the DM like "what the fuck" when he just made the child that the Bard killed be the same one they were looking for. Either this is a party of Murder Hobos and everyone's killed some kids, or they've had the old switcheroo happen one too many times with crowds of hooded people.  Not to say groups of hooded individuals aren't suspicious already.
I don't want a full version..     I NEED IT !
😂❤THIS has been stuck in my head for two weeks 😅❤ I can't stop singing it at work😅... I'm 6'1" so most other people around me are... SHORT! 😂 BAHAHAHAHA
Fck never knew i needed this
The rules lawyer in me wants to say that Vicious Mockery is saving throw spell, so Nat 20 means the child makes the save and take no damage  The rest of me who is sane just vibes with the song
"I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1....fork"
I love this detail.   Viscious mockery is a crap spell, dealing at most 4 damage.   A child in DnD has 4 hit points.
Tom Cardy is a best bard in the world!
I love hoe he says "child" along with the DM. You can see him realize half way through the sentence what the DM was about to say
I genuinely cannot count how often I have watched this. I have gone from laughing hysterically, to this being my hype song to start playing BG3 to all of the damn above. I want to see this live.
This is perfect
"SHORT."
He roasted the kid to death… hilarious
That “B*tch” at the had me on the ground.
It took me 4 watches to notice the DMs natural disdain when Tom originally rolled a natural 20, which means this exact thing happens all the fucking time with Tom.
Perception succeeded: you realize the bard's flute is actually a drumstick😂
easily the best song you have ever made and they have all been good.
More of this pls
Loot that madafaka!😅😅😅😅
When you finally realize he's not holding a flute... perception check 1
So spotify when?
We need a full series about Nat 20
My ADHD brain has had--  "Me and mah bois gonna mess you up!!  I rolled a 1  I rolled a one.  ...Fuck"  --stuck in my head for hours now.
How you gonna have someone roll a 20 and not tell them the small one is a child? It's not like he rolled a 16 or something.
Full song plz
Please make a full version of this, I LOOOVE the flute 🪈 ❤️
That was epic. Masterclass👏👏👏👏🤣🤣🤣
He did an ocular pat-down of the situation
Can we get a full proper song?  This gives me the same joy hearing a Weird Al Yankovick song does.
It's a Bop
no one metioning that he says "its always a kid"  Implying that he has not murdered one but multiple kids
Very strong William Papadin energy going on right there
amazing
I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes, these mothafuckas mean to derail the campaign, and that's just how it goes...
One of your best songs! Been listening to it on repeat for the past two days! Keep up the good work!
Thank You YouTube algorithm we win again🙌🏽😂
I need a full song of this
I think it was on my 10th(ish) time watching that I realized that he is using a f*cing drumstick as a flute.
“loot that muthafucKAAAA”
my jaw has been dislocated for like a year. I vibed to this so hard it genuinely snapped it back into place. so i guess thanks for the bardic inspiration
0:58 saving this to share (timestamped) for the next time i cast this spell
So much is gained from such a short song. A D&D party in which most of the party cares and plays with sincerity but constantly just rolls terribly and can't do anything... and then there's the bard. Barely invested and mostly chaotic neutral but rolls 20s constantly.   I need a full-length musical set in this world. Please, Tom. Make a Kickstarter.
Barder's Gate
I come back to this video at least once a day, it gives me life
Just that point where he decides to loot the body reminds me of how many people while playing games will intentionally kill NPCs just for loot. 😂😂😂
Why have you done this!?! Fuck I already watch your stuff on repeat, stop! Stop! you're ruining my life!
the just yelled "short" completely out of time fucking kills me every time
Your Howard Moon was strong in this one. (Not complaining, lol. I find it hot.)
Can't... nat 20 a vicious mockery roll 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I am crying and throwing up
bards are a straight up menace fr
The most legendary bard, and the most hated by the gm
I'm genuinely confused on what it means to loot a body, mostly because my friend has a character that loots bodies and my first thought was *gathering organs.* My second thought a year later was "stealing their money and/or clothes and whatever else they have on them." I don't know which is correct.
How does he stand up straight under the weight of all of his massive talent?
“There’s no escaping it, I can perceive you.” Has me cackling so hard every time
@1:39 when the DM knows you're about to do some shady shit lol
Man, if  D20 doesn’t at least CONSIDER this for a theme tune if they do an ‘Oops All Bards’ season, I’ll riot 😂
i believe that’s a pan flute specifically
It's just so damn catchy. Listening to it once isn't enough 😂
This needs to be a song in the Apple Music and Spotify apps, please.
You don’t even roll an attack roll on vicious mockery, it’s a saving throw
"My boys are otherwise engaged." Sheer gold.
I'm not even laughing. I am amazed, I'm enlightened, this is a masterpiece
I need a Tom Cardy and Sam Riegel collab in my fucking life right now
I accidentally auto played this on 1.5x speed. Try it. Thank me later.🤣
You look kinda like Joey Silvera, back when he was young.
This is pretty darn catchy. Thank you Secret Galaxy for pointing me into this direction.
Damn bro got a one in 8000 chance to get 3 nat 20’s
I rewatch this... a LOT... and I burst out laughing every time! ... BITCH! XD
I think my favorite part is just him aggressively screaming “SHORT!!!”
Hi I'm back for my daily rewatch of this
I can't stop listening to this. The end loops in my head constantly.
Banger and a half!!!
I try to start every day with this video. Let's fuckin go.
OH FUCK OH SHIT ITS LEARNED DND NOW ITS EVOLVING!
This is awesome thank you 🤯
This is a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJFPNDAYTcc  this is amazing someone did an animation to your song XD
never played DnD, but I might after this just because I found this so entertaining
Okay, okay I’ll watch it AGAIN, YouTube you didn’t have to recommend this to me 😂
I'd definitely would follow the musical adventures of this dnd party!
That “BITCH” at the end had so much power behind it, I took 8D10 force damage.
I love picturing the other people in the group of npcs just watching this bard obtain ultra vision and then immediately break a kid’s brain by taunting him and hurling insults, then proceed to loot the body of the child while playing the flute and the others just watch in horror.
Cursed by how catchy this is. Consistently running through my head all day now 👏🏼
Art, a masterpiece, master-crafted. Comedy *gold*
Tom admitting he's still playing 4E is the real news here.
I'm dead lmfao😂😂😂
It's been 15 days and I listen to this song at least 5 times a day. Such a banger.
Honestly might be my favourite thing on Youtube
I don’t know what happened but it’s 5:35am and I rolled over because my phone was making noise on my night stand. Turns outs this video was somehow playing. I don’t know what this means.
The best part of this video is the fact that the first 20 comments are people saying "the best part of this video is..." and relating to a different part of it. In short it's all pure gold.   Thank you. Praise and worship be unto you. 😂
🤓ummmmm achualy Vicious Mockery doesnt have the caster roll instead the target rolls a saving throw. Unrealistic
Raise dead, all better nobody will know.
Every time I see someone wearing ankle skimming trousers, he's here in my head going *flute riff* SHORT
This song is gold Start to finish
Here’s my head cannon:  This is Shawn Spencer (Psych) playing a bard, Gus Dming, Jules as the half-ork player, and Henry as the rogue. Obviously, Gus blackmailed them all into playing a campaign he made and naturally Shawn refuses to take it seriously like Gus wants. Jules is doing her best, and Henry is confused by the game’s lack of realism. 😂
I wish there was a long version of this more than anything in the world
This shit is so fucking perfect 😂 Edit: I changed was to is, because I keep coming back to it and probably will keep on will keeping to
I don’t subscribe often... But this video alone is all I needed to be convinced. 😂
It's a shame you can only put one LIKE on each video. This one should get at least 1.5K likes just from me.
Ive watched this way.more times than I'd like to admit lmao. The immediate vicious mockery response kills me 😅 def need more of this
Raise that body! Gonna raise that body now Raise that body! And I'll teach the flute to the undead short kid's body!
when is this goin up on spotify..?
Dammit, Tom, have you been spying on my D&D group this entire time?  This was painfully accurate.
died
That is one hell of a little ditty there. Love it!
"It's always a kid."  How many times has he killed kids?!
When he says it's always a kid. This means this isn't the first time he mocked a child for being short.
this is so good and i had to watch it again because it has infected my brain
Need more of this
It's giving The Mighty Boosh vibes and I love it!
I now watched all your Videos and one Thing is certain: you are plenty fun.
I need to figure out how to make this a ringtone
Homey you have to get this animated please🙏🙏🙏
My friends keep repeating the vicious mockery section at me because I'm short 😂
I had the same flute when I was 6
I really want to animate that flute spin at 34 sec to be a constant loop
Baldurs gate hands down.
I have watched this video at least 12 times over the last week and it makes me giggle every. single. time. Kudos.
Where is the 1h loop. I need it. I CRAVE IT.
I'd like to add NEVER roll unless the DM tells you to You're just begging for a 1
I will never be able to loot a body again without thinking of that song and dance.. you've ruined me
I really appreciate it, that all 4 characters feel different from each other. Especially how done the dm is with the bard and starts to question his life choices.  And the bard seems to have rolled a natural 20 for his dexterity check, as it shows in the way he uses the drumstick/ flute.
I can’t stop listening but I’m also not trying to stop either
Don’t mess with Tom’s Human Bard, he magically charged a drum stick into a flute. He’s too powerful.
This song is such a bop
as a long time bard player this is RIGHT
"You're a short muthafucka and nobody likes you. *SHORT*…"  *Rolls a 1 for the Wisdom saving throw, curls into a fetal position and uncontrollably sobs in 5'2*
i like that 1:50 bangers come out and then when the album get released, we get an extended 3-4 Min version that bangs just as hard
This is fire.
I need a series of this. It brings me joy 😂
"... don't." "LOOT THAT BODY!"  aaaaaand I'm dead lol 😆🤣💀
Is it even a good DnD session if someone doesnt chaotically fuck it all up
"Loot that body! Loot that body now. Loot that body! Loot that mothuafucka!" This is now on a soundboard for our discord group. I can't wait to regret this.
I think we can all agree this video deserves a longer version. Lmao. Made my day.
I genuinely enjoyed that
Am i the only one hearing blurred lines? Like so blurry.
Vicious mockery is a spell save, not an attack roll. You can't roll a nat20 on it, instead the kid should've rolled for a wisdom saving throw. This is literally the worst video on the internet.
I've restarted my Baldurs Gate campaign again and made a bard that looks like you mate. Dark Urge.
Watched this last week, and i can't get this song off my head this morning.....lol
I love how all he gets for a nat 20 perception check is that he notices "one of them is a little shorter" and it's also misleading information 😂 Absolutely brutal DM.
How the hell did this go so goddamn hard? This is art my friends.
...so I'm new here, but your hair and mustache remind me of Howard Moon, _and_ this song is something that wouldn't be at all out of place in The Mighty Boosh. Love it.
I have never wanted to go out for a beer with someone more in my life 😂
Engaging with the algorithm
I think if there is a full version of this song in the future, I hope there's a slight alteration. Vicious Mockery is a Wisdom Save, so maybe it could go something like:  DM: You see that one of the cloaked figures is smaller that the others- Tom Bardy: I cast Vicious Mockery. DM, exasperated: Nat 1. Tom Bardy: Let's go.
my first d&d game i was a bard and i swear i essentially did the same crap xD!!!!
Not sure anyone will see this comment but @Seafoodimation-mm7sf made an animation for this and it's very good.
How many times have you hit repeat?  Yes.
I love that he's the one guy that every DM absolutely hates in the party, and also the one who is clearly the smartest in the group. He caught on the same time that the DM told him that it was the child they were looking for. Meanwhile the other two players are still like Huuuh?
This just became one of my favorite youtubers INSTANTLY.    I cannot stop watching this.  I've shared this to literally every fellow musician I know and gamer and tabletop gamer.   MAD RESPECT for making me laugh and dance at the same time.
Where can I go for this kind of dnd ;) seriously though *cry*
but vicious mockery is a save thoooooo. so they gotta roll not you
You're awesome, I subscribed after watching this 😊❤
I've watched this too many times and I can't stop. Please more
Wtf did I just watch 😅
This is actually quite good
I want this animated, stat
I've watched this atleast once a day since it came out. Laugh and love it each time, thank you.
A Bard at the height of his power.
I almost forgot to watch this today
This is seriously one of the funniest things I've ever seen omg.  Great job!!😂
Congrats on 101,000 views. Im soley responsible for 100,000 of those.
I'm pretty sure 200k of these views are just me because this keeps getting funnier every time I see it
“You’re a short muthafucka and nobody likes you” *toots and flutily flutes* “SHORT!” Had me DYING on the floor
When the bard was asking about the positioning, I was worried he was going to say something else. I was relieved by the looting off the corpse of a murdered child.
I was watching something else at 1.25x and didn’t realize this video was sped up at first. It’s so good faster too 😂
I love that its just a TTRPG song and doesn't explicitly mention that dead shore mage property.
I want an animation so bad now
Do more plz 😅
Hilarious my guy
I feel like if you roll a nat 20 on active perception check, you'd know that was a child lmao but i like the idea of realizing that after you made fun of him to the point if a KO
This is one of the greatest things I've ever seen
I love this
Nobody else intriguded by the Cheese Knees then?
You've got long shins
This absolutely needs to be on the next album
i think you should do more flute that was good
20th time and it’s like brand new 😂
Vicious Mockery is a saving throw, not an attack roll.  The burn was so suck it broke the rules of the game.
There's one in every campaign
How do you nat 20 a DC based cantrip
so excited for the bdg collab!!!!!!!
The degen in me through that same exact fucking thing the moment the DM said yes. This is beautiful.
We need a Fullll!!!!!!!!!!!!
That’s fucking good, youtube had to be more like this, it’s good and so enjoyable
This video is the best thing since sliced bread. You nailed it, man. I laugh every single time I watch this. I have shared it with countless friends.
First piece of content I saw from you. I subscribed before the short ended
Crying over here 😂🤣
luting while looting
I mean, what’s done is done. You might as well get some loot out of it 😂😂😂😂
Holy shit. This caused the laugh wheezing😂😂. Well done!
I can't stop coming back to this, HELP.
A DM that doesn't reveal the cloaked figure is the kid you've been looking for on the first nat 20 perception is kind of a douchemove and deserves to have his npc viciously mocked ;)
I don't get the part about looting the body
I'm biased due to being a massive dnd nerd but particularly because I enjoy when players role play to their class and this is the perfect quintessential bard! He's so gifted a bard he turns a drum stick into a flute!
Would the greathammer that the half-orc barbarian is wielding happen to be called Thunder's Wank?
I find it odd and amazing that Baldurs Gate, following a strong push by Critical Role a few years ago, has brought DnD to the forefront of modern culture, and I'm here for it.
We need a loot that body t shirt pls.
"I roll persuasion to convince them that I'm not a cop... yeah that's a 1."
Dear god, the Bard in every game I have ever played.
I love Tom Cardy
If “murder hobos” was a song…
IS THIS ON SPOTIFY?
That flute spin
My English Teacher recommended me of this song. And I can’t get it out of my head :D
I want this on Spotify so damned bad! I legit come and watch/listen to this video daily because it makes me happy and it's just pure, absolute gold.
Holy mon fatality 1:00
Saw it last week, saw it again today(folks know I play) and every damn time, so damn funnay.  (yes, I lack Mr Hardy's skills)
Tom, I know you'll never read this, but I beg you to cover something from Hall & Oates.  Kiss On My List or Out Of Touch would be the best. I'm just starting to get into music theory, and I've discovered so many hidden levels to your music because if it.  I've been working on a comedy song of my own for about a year, and you've re-inspired me to finish it.
dnd is awsome
Tom Cardy, I like the red flag music, but I don’t like when you kiss he butt
this is so addictive
SAVAGE!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I rolled a 1 I rolled a 1 *fuck*
Wait, what? You do not roll for vicious mockery. That is a wisdom saving throw by the target.
This song is extremely funny and very catchy. I was listening to this on repeat, and with only a basic knowledge of d&d. I only wish it was longer. Definitely going to subscribe. The deadpan "lfg" after the nat 20. the F*&$ after the two critical fails. Most of all though "Playin the flute while I loot that dead kid's bod-aayy" It's hard to believe you fit so much genius into a minute thirty.
Some serious "Flight of the Conchords" energy here
MORE OF THIS
I really want a full version on spotify
Am I in love?
im playing this on loop, and now im imagining this happens every 5 sessions. always looking for a kid, and the bard always kills him. he never learns the lesson, but his group loves him so handles his shenanigans
I absolutely love the vibe and confidence of this one
When's the Spotify launch? Need this in my D&D playlist.
Just imagine that you're a kid, emerging from the forest onto the path, you see a bunch of flailing figures, and the last thing you head before your brain snaps is an Aussie accent murderously yelling ''SHORT! "
"playing the flute while i loot that dead kid's body" is the kind of internal rhyming i live for
He did mention several cloaked figures, so did he just kill the hostage? Wait, what would the child wear a cloak? Also, if he goes to loot the body, the rest of the figures will be within melee range of the bard, and that's not going to end well for him.
Please make the next song: I am not a cop
please you have to make a full song about thissss
That "bitch" at the end. We need more unhinged flute tom
This was far more than hilarious!!! hhahahahaa
Hey Tom, what's the chance of you teaming up with DankPods for something?
I feel the time is right and the world needs a Tom Cardy fantasy epic album.
LOOT  THAT  BODY
Knowing nothing about d&d. booting shaking to Tom regardless.
cant get enough of your vibe dude keep it going!!
This has been my boyfriend's human bard character the past four sessions, I sent this to my whole DnD crew and it made us scream in laughter
Loved the song until i realized vicious mockery isnt an attack roll but is a wis save...sadge
To me, this sounds like it should be on spotify
VICIOUS MOCKERY what the hell man, we aren't even in melee range yet 🤣🤣
How many of you didn't pass the perception check to see that's not actually a flute
Your dance moves are on par with the Noble Knight himself
I didn’t know idubbz and Orlando Bloom had a baby
Party of cloaked figures: Minding their own business, travelling a forest path.  Absolutely no one:  Bard: THESE M@&!#^ERS MEAN TO HARM US, AND THEY GOTTA GO
Hey, did the speed change?
The least accurate part of this is how little they react to the crits. The most accurate part is how common the crits are.
I've been in a slump for years now. I always used to be in bands and love music. You've inspired me to program some new synth and slap the bass again. I may even throw in some accordion. lol. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Full version when??
My Baulder's Gate anthem
I keep coming back to this banger. Shit slaps. Etc. Good song, great comedic timing
I cant stop watchiing this
Totally and 100% inspired to play a Bard from now on.
Now a full game with this bard would be a true masterpiece of an adventure.
Nat 20 let's go!
That 0:22 "let's fkn go" were so smooth.
It's so good. so damn good.
This has been stuck in my head for days and I can’t even get mad about it
Amazing song. Out of curiosity how is called the type of this flute?
Fun fact I just realised: Vicious mockery doesnt require a roll from the attacker
I specifically switched my bard from Lute to Flute because of this video
SPOTIFY NOW
Damn! Banger flute!!!
I've done something worryingly similar in dnd... it was not my finest moment but the kid was evil so...😅
I am hoping in my heart of hearts that this is the next bit to get the animation treatment
Vicious Mockery gives a save roll, not an attack roll. RrreeEEEEEeEEEeEEEe
I rolled a one.....
this song slaps so hard please make it a full thing with music video. it would be excellent.
Too good. Subscribed.
One of the best things is how _laser focused_ he is the moment  he hears the hooded figure is short  Like _look at his eyes!_   No hesitation, immediately casts "vicious mockery". 100% premeditated. This is the culmination of 10 hours worth of shower debate replies after some short motherfucker gave him lip back in the day 😂
lmao!!! i dont even REALLY  "get it" cuz ive never played the game but the song and the musician is so brilliant I get it enough and I was cracking up!!! great job!!!!😂❤😂❤😂
Holy shit I haven’t laughed that much in ages!
"His body's just lying there, right?  Right?" "Yes... Don'-" "LOOT THAT BODY!"  These are my people.  Never change, man.
You're right Tom, bards ARE the best
He even wrote in a balanced 3 person party.
WAIT YOU'RE THE GUY FROM THE DRAGON FRIENDS HOW I AM JUST NOW REALISING THIS
Are those all couch cushions on your walls?  Or are they custom made?  Sweet room!
"My boys and me are gonna mess ya up, I rolled a 1, I rolled 1, FUCK"
this is so good i forgot i was a person for a moment
Tom Cardy: Gives us H. S., showing us how even the smallest of dwarf planets can be the absolute greates on the inside if they just believe in themselves.  *Also Tom Cardy:*
I'm playing this anytime i kill a halfling😂
ART 😂😂😂❤
0:58  you need to not roll a twenty to go with your next turn but as a editor mistake they but a twenty on the screen so tom would have lose if he didn't say ”not twenty let,s fucking go”
That'd be an insight roll, not perception bud, but I understand the confusion.
WAIT A MINUTE- is your flute a drumstick-?
Someone help, I can't stop listening to this day in and day out.
no entiendo absolutamente nada pero me encanta el ritmo, toca aprender con Duolingo
Nothing so beautiful has ever existed 👌
I feel like the Bard rolling for the Vicious Mockery was done just to antagonize me. Guess what, it worked.
I have never played a game like this in my life but Jesus Christ my stomach muscles no longer work cause I laughed so hard watching this 🤣🤣🤣 the flute was just too much hahaha
Hey, uhh...when did you sneak into my DnD group and observe how we play?  Because this feels awfully familiar to me. 😅
I need a full song of this!
Lost somemany times   But i play the flute while i loot tickled me particularly
Literally Sword Af
funny as hell until you have an actual asshole like this at your table 😂
1:04 Stewie?
It's really my favorite one, it is now my alarm to wake up
*aggressive flute* followed by “SHORT” is genius
maybe i don't understand enough about D&D but wouldn't a nat 20 perception check immediately make ALL information about the NPC apparent, including the fact that it's a kid and specifically the kid they've been looking for?
The energy my lil bro brings to every session
Bards are the best, never doubt this.
*Somebody* has been playing Baldur’s Gate
Alternate ending: that Halfling uses Giant’s Might.
You can't roll a Nat 20 on Vicious Mockery because it autohits.
the sudden realisation of the DM before the "don't" is just chefs kiss. why is tom's acting genuinely really good and nuanced
REAL
Oh and can I buy this on MP3?
So... are you Howard Moon?
I relate way to strongly to the dm.
This needs a part two and a part three and a part four and a part five and .... keep going pls!
Tommy's such a good boy GOD I wanna give that hair a tussle
This is the one that finally beats out "Touch Me On My Arm"
DM here, my chaotic bard and rogue sent me this a few days ago and this session they used this song EVERY FUCKING TIME they looted a body.
SHORT!
Scanlan who? XD
think ive listened to this over 30 times now lmao
Can you make a clean version of this for little kids that play DND?
The idea of tom being a chaotic good human bard is awesome
Can we get Tom Cardy to play Scanlan if they ever do a live action Vox Machina?
Real Flight of the Conchords vibes from this one Tom, my god this is perfect. Keep releasing bangers you magnificient bastard
Tom please make this like a series. I want to see the continuing adventures of this ruthless bard!
LOL 😂
Yes?....Don-LOOTDATBODY!
It's giving strong Mighty Boosh vibes, and i love it
Hi, tom. Your music has been a huge help to me after a rough break up. You never fail to make me smile and dance in my car as I go to wherever. You’re awesome, man.
i love the aggression behind te "bitch" it makes you really feel the insult XD
sometimes tom releases a song and im like 'ok, this is probably something he experienced in real life but then dramatized to the nth degree for comedic purposes' but this video is just a transcript of your average dnd session lol
Only note: Vicious Mockery is a saving throw, not an attack roll! Unfortunately you can't nat 20 a Vicious Mockery
full DnD party song when xD
pH en no me na l! I think we're all just spitting at eachother now 👼😂😘😍
I love Steve’s expression at 1:30
this is absolutely hysterical and as D&D player and bard lover i have never felt more seen xD
I need to learn how to play flute
“Loot that mtha7kah!” As he sticks his tongue out is absolutely sending me
I love how he casts Vicious Mockery and rolls the d20 himself instead of forcing the kid to roll a wisom saving throw, the poor DM doesn't even have time to enfoce the real rules
Is that an Irish flute? It kinda sounds like a tin whistle. Makes me want to pick one up X)
Yep. Yes. This. I want this.👍
Funny but knowing their intent to harm is insight not perception.
Why is nobody talking about how it starts, the sheer hatred for what hes gotta do that just gets stuffed down by that first toot
Loot that dead kid's body is now the Australian anthem, naur regrets. Yaur, naur yaur.
The dance he’s doing when he says “loot that body”.
I WANT A FULL VERSION
I f*ckin love Tom 😂
I sent this to my dnd savvy friends at Mach speed
My Bard is a two foot tall Goblin and this is very much his vibe.
S H O R T
I absolutely lost it at “15 days game time and 5 days of our actual lives.”
How come your songs fall so so deep inside my brain and make a home there... For weeks?
This video is so damn good that I, an extraordinarily lazy person, subscribed to your channel.   Bravo 🎉
This and Hot shit are the best things I've heard or seen in a minute.   Must have listened and watched both 60 times today.    Amazing stuff.   God I hope there is more dnd stuff later.
I cannot stop watching this... I have watched this at least 30 times and every time I crack up, this is pure genius!
my literal only complaint about this song is that it's not long enough. it's so fucking good i wish it was a little longer haha
Tom’s hips game is so unbelievably powerful.
On my knees begging for more dnd content
It's the fact that he *aggressively* plays the flute and yells "SHORT!" while looking like he's having an aneurysm 🤣
Me and my boys are on a magical motherf*cken Quest. Got some string and coins from that short ass body. I keep trying to think of possible lyrics for a full-length song lol
"you notice that theres a cloaked figure that is significantly shorter than the rest of the troup-"  *' ' i cast vicious mockery, shattering the mind of the opponent. ' '*  "...nat 20." ' ' LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO ' '
Absolute Genius!
I see Tom took inspiration from his time with the Dragon friends
I fking love this and want to play DnD with you so badly
I notice in the background that you're still raising awareness for Cheese Knees disease.
Is it wrong that I’ve listened to this like 40 times in the last 24 hours?
Dont know why but the "forming meaningful relationships" part and the "bitch" in the end just does it for me.
NAT 20 LET'S GO
Can we select this song as Baldur's Gate 3 official theme song? Larian?
Flight of concords vibes big time. And we’re all here for it.
Bard life play that motherfucking flute
I need animation this video
The bard literally roasted that child to death  Peak D&D gaming
I’m crying, this dude is a gift to humanity and we should all treasure him
I wish I had more likes to give than just the one.
By far the absolute best part about this video is Tom playing a frigging drumstick like a flute and selling it so well that you didn't notice until you read this comment
Critical Comedy Success
I have no clue what this song is about (probably D&D) but I've also been singing "LOOT THAT BODY" everywhere in the house lmao
I would love a multiple verse version of this with the adventures of the overkeen bard
I thought ‘Red Flags’ was a random one off funny song/video and turns out you’re actually a comedic genius. 😂
This man I on another level of comedy
Tom better have a shirt with NAT 20 LETS GO! With LOOT THAT BODY! on the back...
😂😂😂😂I love it
hahahahha 😂😂😂 that was amazing!! firet video of you i am watching 🤣🤣🤣🤣 wtf bro 😂😂
Bruh idk why but I always lose it at the "thats a natural 20, lets fuckin go" XDXD
Legolas lent the bard his weighted dice damn
More of this! Im so hooked :D
"If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and..."  Not an Attack Roll! You can't crit on Vicious Mockery!   ... Tom needs to be viciously mocked. 🤣😅😝
The rapid fluting and then "bitch" at the end is the cherry on top of this video 😭😭
Someone really needs to show this to Brandon Lee Mulligan on Dimension 20!
i love this ever so much
Your music is incredible, beyond just being absolutely hilarious, there's so much happening and it's funky and weird and insane and I keep looping because it's so good 😂
Hmm I’m barely 5’5 so this is a personal attack
Not the bard being chaotic neutral.
HOW DOES HE ALWAYS POST 10/10?
Came for the comments,  WASN'T DISAPPOINTED.
holy shit i love this
perfectly natural in-game behavior.
10/10 song as per usual!
Gotta loot that body 😂
where's the rest of the song 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video nearly killed me. I couldn't breathe for for the entire time. "And that keeps you from forming meaningful relationships!" By the Gods. That is a nat 20 on Vicious Mockery.
I’ve probably played this 80 times in the last 2 days and that is not an exaggeration
this is gold
F bombs are low hanging fruit substitute for wit and lyrical articulation.
Song of the Fucking Year right here
I love all your songs but the flute really elevated this to another tier of humour and I can't get enough
logged into YT for the first time in years to say: I'd listen to a whole album or more of this campaign/'dnd' genre.
Gawd, the intense toesie-tapping while ripping on that "flute" straight into a full-chested, "BITCH." 😂😂😂
Me having terrible spelling: I"M GONNA CAST VISCOUS MOOKRY
I love how Tom is just so casually annoyed he hit a nat 20 on the active perception check, like he knew it would happen and now is just waiting for it to proceed
....world tour with Scanlan Shorthalt when?!?!
cool song and all but vicious mockery is a wisdom save not an attack roll
Why is the "You picked the wrong day" little dance so smooth--
I have not yet played. And this is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen full stop
Why does this give Mikey Gilder (Legends of Avantris) energy to me? 😂
What the absolutely awesome D&D/Viva La Dirt League/Mighty Boosh/Flight Of The Conchords bull crap did I just have thrust into my sensory face holes!? 🤣 Fkn GET IN! 🥳👍
God dammit I’m watching it again
Saw this on twitter & loved it!! I Googled Tom & up came a very raunchy site with a thread devoted to him!! 😳😳
ohhh this is a banging tune ,loving its lyrics and music
This song is so booty shakey
Please please please make this a full song!
You must send this to Larian studio,think Swen will appreciate😅
So groovy,amazing🤩👍🏻
This is absolutely amazing.
This is the greatest thing I have experienced all day
Can’t stop thinking about how great this is
guys holy moly he rolled three consecutive natural 20's
I can't stop, this song has been playing in the background for an hour. It's a delight.
This song is Lava, it's fire as hell yet it still flows so well.
This is one of the best videos I’ve ever seen and I don’t even understand half of it since I’ve never played D&D lmao
This would work so well with an animation xD
Tom's face reminds me of a younger Robert Carlyle. Please don't gut me Begbie
Banger bro, more, please give us more.
Toms internalised short phobia really popping off in this one-
I unironically love the idea of a Bard taking NO points in combat, agility, or any other physical trait.  Instead they rely on unreasonably high perception scores, which they then use to DEVASTATE their opponents mentally through song and mockery, winning the fight before it can even begin.
You sing with such joy! It's truly delightful 😚
The split second look of realization on the GM's face before he says "Don't" cracks me up every time lmaoo
Technically speaking the first perception check should have been an insight check, as you were actively trying to intuit what they're intention was and managed to figure out they wanted to fight from body language.  You don't roll anything for Viscous Mockery either wait. It's a wisdom save
Oh my God I laughed so hard! ❤😂❤
Tom just keeps dropping banger after banger.
This might be the funniest thing Ive seen in quite a while. Well done.
Day 7 of playing this on repeat
Its always the bards with the stupid rigged luck
can I live in that room and... just pitch ideas at you the entire time?
This is my favorite funny music video ever
I don't even play or know a lot about DnD but this shit had me peeing myself. 😂
Hands down, my favourite part is when the dm says "don't" before he loots the dead kids body.
This needs to be released as a full song Tom!!!!! It's so catchyyy
i love you tom, is this on spotify? 👀
shit, this is the best one since "i dont work here". amazing. perfect, short, but im still gonna put it loop while i do my 8 hour work day
My son sent me this video and I couldn't be more proud. Just watched it 5 times and cackled every time😂.👏👏
Listen to his vicious mockery, it's fucking brutal.
Just… *blows flute* S H O R T  Also “I rolled a 1.” “I rolled a 1.” *”F U C K”*
I get aroused by the idea of Tom Cardy collabing with NSP
Gawd!  That LOOT THAT BODY song sticks in my head!
I'll never forget that my first ever dnd session. Was my character punting a child
The best thing I ever saw :D
Brilliant
This might actually be the best d&d themed video I’ve ever seen!
LOOT THAT BODY!~
Literally my character in bg3
🎵 "Me and ma boys gonna mess you up!" 🎵  "I rolled a 1."  "I rolled a 1."  🎵 "FUCK" 🎵  I was CRYING from laughter
do more of these please SO FIRE
All of the little schemes you put in your songs is amazing
I love this so much! I love dnd and this is so accurate of players I've done campaigns with
Pluto's blue sparkle jacket in the background really adds to this
Yo. More funny people doing tabletop RP stuff, hell yes.
“Don’t—“   “LOOT THAT BODY”  😂😂
Please animate this song.
I'd like to see this modded into BG3 as one of the things you can say when you critically hit with Vicious Mockery
0:43 Hands down the best part. "Me and my boys gonna mess you up--" "I rolled a 1." "I rolled a 1." "...fuck." Of all things I expected to be rhymed, I never expected "up" and "fuck" lmfao
Accurate Bard behaviour
I love the idea of failing to even wield your weapon for a fight.
I need a Baldur's Gate 3 mod, where every time someone cast Vicious Mockery, a Tom Cardy song insult plays.
The DM face 😐  is exactly how my husband looks when he has to deal with my swashbuckler rogue 😂
If a nat 20 was rolled when you cast Vicious Mockery that means the target succeeded (most likely) since the only die you roll for Vicious Mockery is the 1d4 psychic damage (if they fail on their d20 saving throw).
The wide eyes, smile and stare while waiting to hear what type of creature it was is also hysterical. That wild anticipation
first he plays the flute, and then he's gonna loot
1 million views!!!!!
So, you will be doing more BG3 related songs and videos, right? Because 1mil views in 6 days isn't too shabby!
“This stupid motherfukin tiny short-ass baby got a tiny little itty bitty body and I hate it” made me burst out laughing
This entire video was real life vicious mockery being cast on me and now i will cast it on all of my friends
Tom playing the drumstick like a flute absolutely kills me 😂😂😂
"I rolled a 1; I rolled a 1; FUCK!" perfectly describes my Baldur's Gate 3 experience 😂
"Loot that body" is possibly the hardest drop lmao
As a dm, I would instantly give you inspiration for this masterpiece.
Here from Will Neff's stream, fucking brilliant job lad o7
Is this on Spotify? It needs to hit my playlist😂
The view counter on this video seems to be broken it only shows my views.
god i love this video. i have watched it like a dozen times by now on loop and still vibe hard with it! also i can feel the frustration of the DM at this bard, which i totaly would be.
If I point out that Vicious Mockery is a save from the DM and not an attack roll by the bard, am I opening myself to more Vicious Mockery?  PS - A screen grab of "Loot that Body" is already being regularly traded around my table. Fan-fucking-tastic.
This has been absolutely stuck in my head for the last 6 days.  Send help.
Absolute masterpiece!
What I find interesting is that he made an attack roll for vicious mockery
I've watched this more times over the past day or so than I care to admit. I identify with it so much and have been in that situation so many times while playing D&D
God Tom, I'd love to see some TTRPG tracks for the great real play podcasts
where do I put my money to get this on spotify
I cant stop watching this over and over. Its just so good. Sing along 😂
this is a masterpieceee
Dear Larian Studios, *please* put this in Baldur's Gate 3 as some sort of awesome easter egg or flute based bard side quest!!
I am way too familiar to the pain which DM feels…
I've watched this over 50 times and counting .... in 2 days ....
This is some of the best nerdy content I've ever seen.
congrats on reaching 1M views on this video! you're welcome, btw. This song is so addicting i'm responsible for 0.1% of its views
I sent this to my DM last night and just said “knew you’d love this”, he simply replied back “why does this sound familiar?”
I think I've listened to this 100 times in the last two days. It's like...comfort food. I especially love the "We rolled ones." "Fuck, looks like i'm on my own"
Can’t wait for this on the next album release
I FUCKING LOVE THIS YOU ARE AMAZING MAN PLEASE MAKE MORE DND SONGS PLEASEEEE MORE LUCKY BARD  😂😂😂😂😂
"AND I HATE IT!" this part slays me, every time, I think it's the funniest part XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Any chance we could purchase this on itunes?
This song goes so incredibly hard, I don’t understand you musicians, how do you do it
I have listened to this an embarrassing number of times. Like a 6 year old with that one movie he plays over and over again…. It’s so catchy though.
ok I watched all of your videos at least three times. I can comfortably tell you to get a better camera. you are ROBBING US OF YOUR VISUAL FIDELIT--
Why can't I stop watching this?
May I never unsubscribe this channel 🙏🏾👏🏾😂
Nothing makes a DnD story better than addong the actual real time time spent on the event. It always ups the comedy factor by 10.
This may be harsh, but Tom's favored enemy is kids.  One time they touched his tonka truck and it scarred him for life.
I think the DM should check that Tom doesn't have a weighted die.  Guy's rollin' a suspicious number of nat twenties
For some reason the thing I always lose it at is him just SCREAMING 'Short!' into the 'flute'
Not only did you absolutely NAIL this DnD jam, but I wont act like I didn;'t notice that Ampeg fridge in the back looking...perception check...FUGGIN NICE
Ok...this has to stop.   It's been like the 10th time I've listened to this....what..have..you...DONE?  Edit: AND IT MADE ME SUBSCRIBE!!! YOU MONSTER!   *starts up video again*...
I can't stop laughing! For the rest of my life, this will pop into my head whenever I roll for a perception check, and I'm totally OK with that. Thank you!
TC i love ur music but you dont need to roll an attack roll for vicous mockery. Do better.
I heard Red Flags and Mixed Messages a while ago from TikTok and im so glad i decided to go down the rabbit hole of Tom's songs because they're all amazing 😭
Need a full version for an album or some shit thankssss
Lets be honest : both the barbarian and the rogue were about to murder the kid. Barbarian was about to split it in two if he finished the sentence and the rogue was about to ask if he has sneak attack. Bard just happen to go first xD
the flute solo + BITCH is such an underrated lizzo reference LOL
Dammit why did it take me almost a week to realize Tom's "flute" is just a drumstick.
Tom being into D&D is something I’d never think he would like but now it makes perfect sense and I NEED more.
Scanlan vibes and I love it
I desperately wish this was a full 3 minute song
That is so gold.
You completely shatter his mind, his self-worth, and his self-respect, he takes four damage.
What funky and groovy lil beat this song has, awesome
This will be stuck in my head all day…. 😂😂
Ah, Richard Hammond's more musical, Australian cousin. This has me cackling so much.
Found this on Facebook, which took me to instagram, so I could find you here. This is a masterpiece. Thank you for this!
This is so fucking good, I'm angry. How dare you be so talented, Tom Cardy. Fantastic!
The "Short" is shouted with such hatred it's amazing!! I love this song!
oh so just an average DnD session, huh?
I don't play D&D (unfortunately) and this whole bit is still just me killing someone in an RPG, insulting them viciously as I attack them looting then and insulting them more
"i'll be better" also immedietly decides to loot the dead childs body
may i feel as satisfied about anything ever as this bard does when he says 'loot that body'
We need a FULL 4-6 minutes version of this song so i can but it
This is the Macarena in a different key and with better words 10/10, no notes
Marry me papito❤
Not only does this song slap, but it makes me laugh so hard. You pack so much into two minutes.
I need a full version this song so I can loop it over and over again.
Oh,when new song - "Red Flags Uno Reverse"?
This is perfection. Sounds just like my table 🙌
Lol. This sounds like something that would happen at Dimension 20
Almost a week later and I still randomly whistle a bit before going "SHORT!" for no real reason.
This is probably my favorite thing on the planet. I’ve watched it maybe 10 times now and it’s still just as hilarious as it was the first time
I see loads of comments of people agreeing that this is a certifiable bop. But can we also mention his immaculate moves? Just... ✨perfection👌✨
This live free in my head
My favorite Tom! Could you write a song about John Justin Bunting? Also, don't forget your boxers!
I would watch an entire series on Tom the Human Bard just ripping a continent to bits
I'm a bard myself and I'm just waiting for an encounter with any short npc. I am going to instantly do that.
SHORT!!
It reminds me of when my ecoterrorist druid gnome torched a bunch a inocent people by accident. That was wild.
Why didn't you ever release the recording of you pranking Hobba with the "Weird Guy" song?
You really sold the whole flute thing to me, I watched it a solid 10 times before I realised it was a drumstick lol
Tom I genuinely love all your videos they are hilarious. Have you ever thought of reaching out to NobleKinght? He does similar vids and with you providing musical comedy I think shit would be funny as hell.
Какой же это хороший)
I once had a natural 20 as a cat lady demanding an Elf king to do something so (the quest could end, get rewards and) I could go and devour tuna. The King was impressed, my character ate tuna, and the quest was done. A victory for all.
The angry flutting right before yelling SHORT! is a highlight of YouTube. As a whole.
Added to favorites
bg3 in a nutshell
I'm obsessed with the gesture he makes when singing "I can perceive you"
Sooooo... what did you get when you looted the body?
Higher Ground +1 bonus... Even if you take the low hanging fruit. Just sayin'
yeah I see ya
I can't tell you how many times games I was in went off the rails that hard 😂
Is there a song similar song like this? " Loot that body , *gonna loot that body now* , LOOT THAT BODY ,  *GONNA LOOT THAT MOTHA7KA* " Love this part 😂
Why does this make him even more attractive lol 😅
This is total Freezo behavior
Tom Cardy the Bard!!!! LETS GOOOOOO!!!
Oxventure vibes 😂
As a member of the "Always the DM" club,  I can attest that this is an accurate representation of an entire campaign. 😂🎉
Honestly this is the dm's fault. The kid wasnt short. He was a kid and kids are small.
Never have I heard such a well-crafted drumstick flute
I need this song on an hour LOOP!!!
See...  That's why you always roll an INSIGHT check.  Perception doesn't tell you intentions toward you.  Gotta roll that Insight.
Please make this a song animated
Mr. Cardy...dont think i dont see that singular RIGHT ear pericng.... Otherwise the song is very funny especially since my gf has been getting into dnd
Please do more tunes about DnD play cause gotdamn this was funny
20/20 I need a full song. this is gold.
This song needs more verses...
I love how the most toxic one of the characters is the Bard, rather than the Half-Barbarian Orc whose always fighting on the front lines or the Rogue whose probably like a stereotypical TF2 spy player.
I recommend watching this at 1.25 speed... over and over and over
Wait, if you roll high on your perception you can see the shiny blue outfit in the background, which was used in HS. The early spoiler.
My best friend and I started playing dnd with our group about a year ago now and she plays a sassy half-elf bard, so when I saw this on tiktok I immediately sent it to her
I could listen to this on repeat for at least an hour - lol
My favorite part of this song is how it's a story of Tom rolling 3 nat 20s and absolutely destroying a campaign. Best rolls of his life, and it did less than nothing.
welcome to my dnd playlist. this has somehow erased the rest of the playlist so i guess i'll just play it on loop forever
I play this on repeat now tyvm, more please
Finally an accurate representation of dnd
This is just so good
I need the full version right now!
when he asked if the body was just lying there the dm went no dont the he said loot the body i bout died laughing there
As a DM, I can feel the simultaneous pride in my player for being so true to character that he'd murder and loot a child as well as indescribable sorrow that the fucking bard is at it again.....
God this is a banger, and so incredibly accurate.
This is the most amazing thing ever, I show it to all my friends. This is what DnD is all about!
Ohh i cant wait till this comes to spotify
Can this be what the channel is about?  Love this!
Why is every song this guy writes an absolute slapper?
I can't stop playing this.  between the hilarious delivery and the ear-worm tune....   Thanks!.    Also... more please =)   I may or may not be daydreaming about a short series of the bard's adventures.
And this is why bards are the best 😂😂😂
This is so D&D that I can't xD
The only problem I have with this song is that it’s too short and I can’t cast vicious mockery to make it longer
Laughed so damn hard that coffee shot out my nose.😂
I love how happy Tom looks when he's singing "Loot that body."
Love this so much. Would love a full song with different scenarios and interactions. Hope you had as much fun making it as it seems 👏
Oh my god the editing is a work of art
I never knew I needed a Tom D&D seires in my life until now
This brought me unbelievable joy 😂
Natural songwriter. Natural comedian. How about that. Brilliant!
I BODILY need a full album-length extended version of this song. Absolute banger, just has no reason to go as hard as it does. The lyrics, the music, the mixing, just all around amazing. Instantly subscribed and shared this around because, my god, how could I not?
Tom Cardy meets DnD is the crossover I had no idea I needed more than anything in my life today. Legend
LMFAI I LOVE THIS
The glorious "fuck" at unison of the three voices is just a masterpiece.
Someone please tell what kind of flute he used. Need to know for a future char
WHY IS IT SO FUCKEN CATCHY
Thank you for this. This is the funniest DnD related thing I've ever seen. Reminds me of Flight of the Conchords. Please do more of these, I laughed so friggin hard.
Full version when?
i come back to this video so often <3 thank you so much for this absolute banger, Tom !!
"me and my boys are gonna mess you up" "i rolled a 1/i rolled a 1" "fuck"  been there. that story ends with my malkavian going into a frenzy and a truly impressive attempt at breaking the masquerade.
What was this??
LOOT THAT BAAADY!
Love this so much. Top 3 for me with HYCYBH and Big Breakfast.
This is all the convincing I need to finally try this game. I am very tempted now.
The DM realizing too late that the child was going to get looted is the story of every DM. This whole song is just the story of every D&D campaign in existence.
Should have ended it with you telling SHORT?! again lmfao
I need an extended version of this pls 🤣
1:26 Tom realizing and mouthing “child” along with the DM might be the funniest part.
I think I've listened to this 100x's since its release. it wont ever get old.  I need a whole album for this. Pleeeease.
I’ve watched this like 20 times. The line that gets me is when he’s like “me and my boys are gonna mess you up.” Immediately followed by “F***” it’s just perfect.
You’ve had some absolute BANGERS, my dude, but this one goes even harder🔥🔥🔥
I laughed so hard I cried
PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF FLUTE YOU ARE PLAYING!!
I like the point that everyone says "my character" and stuff while he says "I." I do the exact same thing when i play when im like SUPER into the game. Idk if this was intentional or not but i liked it anyways.
Can you make some family friendly versions? I can't play it at karaoke and it annoys me
Goodness this is so, so excellent
I can’t stop watching this 😂😂😂
"i rolled a one" "i rolled a one" "FUCK" had me in hysterics
genius. i want to see where this group goes next in their campaign
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vicious mockery is a save not an attack roll so the kids probably fine
Somebody has been playing dnd lately😂
I KNEW THIS WAS A DND SONG………dose that mean I’m a geek😳😳
This hits so perfect. The comedic timing is gold.
When the bard roll a nat 20 in performance in real life
I’m already picturing a cover of this by Scanlan, Grog, Vax and Matt Mercer.
Bards do love their lutes. You can't blame them for looting.
There are Unearthed Arcana rules that outline how to play a game where players roll all the Dice including enemy attack rolls (reframed as player's defense rolls) and saving throws so actually It's perfectly possible for the Vicious mockery roll to be done by the player. on this Technicality I decree Tom has a broader knowledge of the rules than you do.  TLDR: get bent
I love how "Cheese Knees" has been in the background since appearing in Level Clear.
0:45
I NEED more of this song!  And of the crew's adventures! 😂  I play a bard in my mates' BG3 campaign and Vicious Mockery has always been my go-to spell.  So this song has become my theme whenever combat occurs, we run into a child, or if I just start looting the place 😂❤
That "loot that body" reminded me of my D&D games where everything is desecrated by the players (I do it too xDD)
Average Bard player ngl LMAO
I really hope Cohhcarnage have watched it ^^
TOM CARDY i am so thankful for your songs and your music it really like REALLY cured my depression and my anxiety from making new connections in life i am truly thankful and i enjoy every single song you have made so i hope you keep on making them because this hits different and to remember your songs i bought the transparent blue vinyl signed as a thank you too :) Keep doing these you have a god talent mate ;)
Immediately sent it to my D&D group once it ended. 😂
"It's always a kid."  Ooooooof. For so many reasons.
beautiful all of us have a tom in our party
0:34 literally obsessed with the flute twirl
"I rolled a one."  "I rolled a one."  "Fuck!"
Only Tom Cardy could play the flute on a drumstick and nobody would question it
A murderhobo bard is a very interesting concept.
1:40 I seriously need a gif of Tom singing loot that body so I can watch it over and over again
Tom cardy x d&d is the crossover I always needed
I’ve listened to enough RPG horror stories to understand everything that happened here! 😂😂😂😂😂
I love that "bitch" at the end
This song is not only the catchiest thing I've ever heard it's ALSO about D&D. I couldn't ask for more in life. I can die in peace now.
Yup.  I died when I saw this.  lol
Baldur's gate 3? Aside from d&d obviously. Just thohght I mention cauee I love bg3 lol
How many children has Tom's human bard viciously killed?? 😂
This NEEEDS to be a series
I hope to god this gets a full version for the next album, I want to hear the extended adventures of Tom Bardy
HES DONE IT AGAIN HE MADE ANOTHER BANGER
Too bad crit fails/successes dont exist on ability checks
I had to listen to this again after first listening to it because it is just that amazing xD
When do I buy it? FLAC plz ;)
Best one yet, way to go
This is the best thing I've seen in my life 😂
i have listened to this an embarrassing amount of time in the last 3 days. thank you
This seriously just popped up in my autoplay feed and I didn't reach the cancel button in time and THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T DISABLE AUTOPLAY
the fact that you didn't say "doot my flute while I loot" upsets me greatly
god dam Tom, you're a genius. NEVER, change.   Edit: i tried to report you for being funny.... was hoping for an "other" section so i could say " this should be your (youtubes) featured video today".  there is no such option :(
Oh shit. This is hilarious
Ok i think this tops the entire channel.  I'm humiliated by the level of genius here.
Isn't Vicious Mockery a wisdom saving throw?
Accurate…
Dude, don't make fun of short people. Not even my uncle, even though he's a dumbass.
I love how when he yells "SHORT" @ 1:04 it echoes just like it does in Baldurs Gate 3 when you cast vicious mockery xD
Will you ever get an actual camera or do you intend to film on your phone forever? Just asking
1:41 The personification of smug 😀
This video broke me (with laughter).  I have played D&D for longer than I will admit but I was around before THAC0 so yeah.  But my goodness in a few seconds he reps every DM in any campaign that ever campaigned.
I accidentally left my speed on 1.25x and now my brain wont let me watch it normally
It wasn't until just now that I ever thought that a D&D musical would be a fantastic idea, but now it's all I want (provided that Tom produces the music)
I need gif versions of all 3 verses. Slap it on a sound board for playing BG3
Tom just yelling "SHORT" is perfect
I just keep hitting play again and laughing. The fact that the other party members had to reiterate that they Crit Failed their rounds because he wasn't paying attention is too accurate.
This is the best thing I have ever heard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I keep coming back to listen to this and I think my favorite part of the video is how excited the dm looks as he's like "Okay so one traveler is a bit *SHORT* like a certain someone you've been ~searching~ for and-" only for it to immediately be ruined. This poor man had so much hope, someone help him lmao
This sounds straight out of Flight of the Conchords
omfg XD
He's just lying there, right? Right?
Fuckin killed it nice dude
Bard privilege
coughcoughviciousmockerytakesawisdomsaveandnotanattackrollcoughcoughcoughcough
You can see the joy in his eyes when he sings "loot that kids body"
It fills me with a lot of joy that the 'cheese knees' sign is still in the background. 😌 I want a public information film/song that reveals the details and prevention of this deadly disease! 🧀🤢
This is amazing
1:43 "gotta loot that muthafucKAH" 😂
This definitely needs to be a whole song!
Seems you rolled a 1 on the mainstream signing of the musical industry but a 20 on the comedic music niche that we all deserved. A banger, as always.
just noticed that Tom isn't playing a Flute but a Drumstick, i watched this video 12 times now..... guess i failed the perception check
Beautifully made yet again. Made me laugh too much
Every time I listen to this I pick up new nuances in the music. the two note flute at :27 that shows up again in the next stanza a few octaves higher and with some funk smeared on itz The slightly creepy "I can perceive you" harmony in the left ear around :40 The WICKED walking bassline at 50: in the right ear The low end vocoder bass harmony throughout is great The funktastic organ groove that makes up the backbone is goofy but also really great with the syncopation...  Its been a while since I have had this much fun listening to a song.  The mixing is fantastic.
I feel the pain of this DM. Literally had the same thing happen. "You guys find a child in the house." "We kill the child!"
Tom holy shit XD I am just a nobody from ireland  and I would love to play DnD with you sometime every XD This song alone makes me know that you would be HILARIOUS and amazing to play with at a table of players in a semi serious mostly silly campaign XD
Do I play D&D?  No.  Did I laugh and am now smashing "play" over and over again because my tiny ADHD brain is being flooded with So Much Dopamine?  Yes.  (I have a lot of friends who play D&D, so I understand what's happening. Can't really blame Tom for looting the body. I mean, it's *right there.* What else is he gonna do?)
I can only think of the Smosh Sword AF crew reenacting this. The chaotic energy is such a match lol
I love how Tom is visibly trying not to laugh when delivering a lot of the bard’s lines.
I think this is him coming out and saying he is literally a human bard...which would explain how fucking awesome all his music is
This is such a banger! I wish it was on Apple Music!!
im gonna say it, i've listened to this song atleast like near a 100 times, i still anticipate of saying bones instead of toes, you made such a gotcha and i can't adapt to it
*aggressive flute solo * SHORT🫵
1:34 AHHHA I can't , loothorders do be like that 🤣😭
Can't wait until BG3 comes to Xbox so I can make Tom Cardy my character
As someone who has dm’d, I can confirm that there’s always one player who wants to obliterate the npc’s
NAT 20 LET'S FUCKING GOO!!!
I am more alive after watching this than I was before
"Your vicious mockery shatters the mind of the child" what a hilarious line I cannot stop laughing.
Love how his first perception check was wrong lol
Tom Cardy is the best.
Classic Cardy
Was singing this song in my sleep last night 😂
I’m so into his energy when he said loot that body part😂
I've just become a D&D player, and this could not be more true how things can go sometimes.  Wish our bard played this way. 😂
This broke me I'm in hysterics 😂
Playing this is now part of my daily Baldur's Gate prefunk
Maybe the best one yet
I feel it's a DM mood that he started out describing a group of cloaked figures, but the moment the Bard starts on his bullshit then the rest of the supposed group beside the kid are just forgotten. You can imagine the DM's next words are. "The rest of the cloaked figures watch you loot the child. They're creeped out."
I showed this to my friend when introducing her to tom cardy's music and she just died laughing. "Loot that body" is now our favorite line
I play this song like 6 times straight every time I start up baulders gate 3. Fucking love this
Cheese knees
I was walking through the store this morning and couldn't stop humming "Loot that body". Also the "I can perceive you" line gets me every time.
Amazing as always ahah
Please PLEASE make this a full song, it is such a fucking bop and I need it my life, another banger!
100% my favourite song so far. Brilliant.
the phone aspect ratio is...unfortunate
I cant believe how low this view count is. This vid has made it to millions on every other social media platform.
I feel this all too well, My friend decided to fight a group of 26 goblins by first disguising as barrels. And My true pal just decides to use a customized rule that each character had… he doubled a spell named Shockwave, and the dm, already Over it. Just said you killed everyone, both goblin and party, so me, also human bard rolls natural 20 and says “Loot ALL the short gobbo shits!” And all my friends laughed their ASSES OFF. To make it even better this happened when this song came out😂 I feel this way too much…
I'm not even exaggerating when I say I've watched this 100+ times over the last couple days lol so good!
So… there’s gonna be more too this some day.. right? Because I need MORE!
I have actual tears streaming down my face. Thank you. That's a sub.
That last 'bitch' was personal
Okay but King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard needs to get you on one of their funky songs, ASAP. They're missing out
Are there more of this type of D&D song video? The audio here was really catchy.
"i cast vicious mockery  Nat 20" But it's a save or suck cantrip not a hit/miss cantrip??
Catchiest somg of 2023
Well, guess I found the next song I want to animate in my spare time. Blessed Rolls
This just keeps getting better.
You get a lovely tone out of that drumstick.  Much respect.
I watched this a hundred times, the delivery is sublime -  natural 20... - *calmly* let's fucking go.  masterpiece
"Nat 20" "Let's fucking go" Why is  THAT the funniest part to me
my consrabr dnd experience
My kids are almost old enough to play dnd. Can't wait to sing this song to them
Can't Stop this video and singin' this song. Thanks AHAHAHA
Nat 20 lets go-  famous last words of tom cardy (great song!)
"emotional damage!!" (с)
Im laughing so fucking hard. Thats just me with everything.
Everyone is on about the music which is amazing obviously but that's some insane acting talent playing multiple parts and selling it so well reminded of Monty python.
The syncing of the hip swing with 'loot that body' is 🤣
Good GOD i haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Thank you Tom, you are truly the gift that keeps on giving.
I think this is the most I've laughed in a good while.
I love Red Flags😈😉❤
This is the example of a non sexual bard
try red flags with the witers
How many times did I watch this? Yes.
Saw this on twitter on my bus ride home for work and tears in my eyes from laughing. I'm going to bed now and I'm here to listen once more and I still 😂😂
I had such a bad day today and you brightened my day so much, thank you so much Tom ;v;
I need a purely instrumental version to play during battles in my goofy dnd campaign pls do your fellow tom a solid 👉👈🥺
Jeez already #44 on trending xD
Chaotic stupid alignment right here
the flute twirl is so fucking amazing i laugh every fucking time.
I need so much more of this
I need a full version of this, please X3 it's so great.
god i need this to be a full song
I just found this channel and did a deep dive.  I’ve failed as an artist…
Please make some more Bard songs, this freaking rocks and I was dying watching this.  That comes from a DND Bard player
looot THAT MODAFOKAAAA
Astarion would approve
Another banger from Tom Bardy
That almost screaming emphasis on those keywords like, " of course you had to go and do this to us and our campaign.... again"
This song is the cheese knees
Once I was doing a campaign and I kept rolling straight ones, like nat. Ones, and we figured out that because the hand sanitizer I had used warped the plastic when I was using it 😢
"Loot that body, loot that body" me a loot goblin: I love the internet sometimes
My friend has lots of stories about breaking the game when playing as a bard lol
Thats the best thing I ever saw omfg
Absolutely fan-fuckingtastic. I have been treating BG3 like a fine battle of scotch and playing seldomly to thorughly enjoy it. This song has made me decide to chug down BG3 like a shit bottle of whiskey.
I need more Dnd related music that I can send my players when they mess up spectacularly and hilariously
I love how the flute is a drum stick.
Ski-Bap Ba-Dap ... have you checked his butthole?!?!
Wheres the full song? I can't help but notice that there was a "Group" of cloaked figures, So now I need the full song to be written where the bard just one by one, Verbally eviscerates each and every one of the, ideally, innocently cloaked individuals.
Loot that body is now stuck in my head
*yoooooo*
The little hip shimmy/flute twirl at 'the wrong day'. Incredible effervescent remarkable
You don't have to roll to hit for Vicious Mockery. By the way.
This almost surely is just Tom recounting an actual D&D sesh.
should have rolled insight, woulda got nat 20 and avoided the whole thing
Man can you release a b-side with this and the fellowship of this is my book
Yoooo can we get this bad boy on music streaming platforms? Like spotify?
banger
I love that out of the trio, it is not the barbarian or the rouge who are the murder hobos, but the fucking bard.
me and mah boys are gonna mess ya up i rolled a 1 i rolled a 1  *fuck*
this was extremely delightful. thank you
I can't stop watching this. It's still funny every time.  :D
Roll for subscription, natural 20.
So… who else is watch this about a hundred times now.  Oh and is also still laughing
This is unreasonably good music xD
as a 25+ yr forever DM/GM ( I mean game time not age) the resigned expression and the "don;t" with the implied pls, kudos. It never changes. jfc.
I want to hear a whole campaign musically narrated this way.
This is an absolute work of art. This belongs in the pantheon of great D&D music for all time. I'm not kidding in the slightest.
I love the weight and foreboding with which the dm says "that's a natural 20" on the first active perception check. He's knows .... "HERE WE GO"
1:09 the subtle vocode lifts this line into the heavens
I've had sessions exactly like this! (Well, less awesome singing and epic flute music, but when it comes to the general feeling).
"So let me get this straight. In this story, that *you* just told, while walking down a forest road, you happened to encounter a group of random people, and *immediately* proceeded to verbally assault the CHILD among them, until their mind COLLAPSED. And then followed up by rifling through said child's pockets for their personal effects."  "Okay but HOW you tell the story matters."
what kind of flute does that sound
Tom packing a 19 rizz.
Why was the intro so fire
Is this a ballad?
Great video
this man just keeps gifting us with MASTERPIECES
Free song idea: post-nut clarity after an extensive period of edging allows one to understand the secrets of the universe previously unknown to man.
this song has no business going so hard. 10/10
Concept: Smokin' Joe Rudeboy is a bard, and flipping the bird is how he casts Vicious Mockery.
The line "it's always a kid" opens up a horrifying and hilarious rabbit hole. This seems to happen frequently, so not only is there a trail of kids behind the party, but the DM continues to put kids disguised as adults in the path of the party, despite knowing what happens... frankly, this is on the DM. THEY are the ones that want dead kid bodies  to get looted. lol
the first flute note kick starting the beat has no right slapping as much as it does!
I love that song as a D&D noob. I wish it was longer
Lmao IMMEDIATELY loots the body
This is your best video to date!
This was posted on the day my nephew was born so now whenever I see a picture of him I get "When you were born, everybody thought that you were just a head But then the doctor said "Wait, this stupid muthafuckin' tiny short ass baby got a tiny little itty bitty body and I hate it" stuck in my head, so thanks for that lol
I think this might be my favorite song of yours as far as the music goes(which is saying something cause thyre all amazing)but something about the flute mixed with the more electric sounds is just so much fun, listening to your songs makes me want to actually learn music theory
I cast magic missile. Um there's nothing around you, what do you cast it at?  The _darkness_ . Does anyone want a mountain dew!?!?
I shared this with my DnD group and our DM gave us a +1d6 to use in our next session as a "meme bonus"
"Me and my boys are gonna mess you up" "I rolled a 1" "I rolled a 1" "Fuck"  Absolute poetry <3
As a bard player since 2nd edition; We defientley need a collection of viscious mockery playlist of 30s song or inspiration performance based on all the skills!!!! pleeeeeeaaaaaaase
This could win the first Nobel Prize for TikTok
Love this, but isn't vicious mockery a saving throw, not an attack roll?
This is unironically catchy, 10/10 job.
Hey, how did you get access to my game session?
This video is a nat 20.
I’d love a full length song of this.
When he says “loot that body” kinda… 😏
*Being short and cries in the corner*  This is very accurate and I get roasted every time
WE NEED THIS ON YOUR NEXT ALBUM THIS IS INCREDIBLE
Never enjoyed the "Loop" function of Youtube before but after both my morning & evening commute spent listening to this catchy AF tune, it's neat. 😋👍
He really rolled a 20 on deception cause that is not a real flute
Not me actually looting the goblin kids' dead bodies in the Worg Pens the moment the "loot that body" bit dropped 💀💀💀
Is this on spotify? I need this to randomly start playing during my day
Can we talk about the fact that Tom rolled 3 natural 20s in a row? That's a 1/8420 chance for it to happen. Tom might be the best DnD player of all time.
Help, I've listened to this too many times and would like a longer version, please.
“My boys are otherwise engaged” is the most relatable part for me, considering my parties are either a completely united front that cooperates flawlessly, or four raccoons with dice engaging in whatever shenanigans activated their single neuron first.
genuinely hope this song gets the "mixed messages" treatment and Tom chooses to bless us with a new entire verse to the song about something entirely incongruous with the original topic
Hey, I usually like ur stuff Tom cardy, but this one felt extremely disrespectful.  I have a disability, and I'm sure some other people may hav also felt similarly.  I've been watching ur stuff since covid days* and i enjoy lots of ur content. 💙 but I think this is the first time I've seen something of urs n felt annoyed and hurt.  I'm not a short statured person, and I cant speak for other people. To me this felt hella pointed. I hope u understand what I mean 💙
The realization on the DMs face when he asks if the body's just lying there. XD
I just want this as my ringtone
i cant count how many times ive watch this its so good lol
this is 12/10
Loot that body!😂
I think I'm 100,000 of these views. More, please. Also, love the subtle electro voice xD
How intensely he vibrates when he plays that flute is amazing, I can't stop watching.
0:34 that stick flip?? Hello??
I am crying. This is hilarious! I just clipped and sent to my vertically challenged friend...
https://youtube.com/shorts/Z3ft-1O002Q?si=Q40p4UC08g2VO7fY  Stop Asian Hate😂
Man this is such a bop.
The fact that the bard comes to the realization that it was a child at same time of the reveal like it’s a constant occurrence is simply icing on the punchline
Guys, a bard can kill you simply by calling you short. Imagine trying to hunt down the serial killer of the town and its just a bard roasting motherfuckers
this would be amazing animated
This totally just reenacted my whole last campaign I DMed with my crew. Total anarchy and shenanigans that the players would pull just so that they could derail my story line. Also, this is just plain hilarious!
LOOT THAT BODY LOOT THAT BODY😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So good
Please make this into a song I beggg
y'kno, if this guy would play a bard in a D&D campaign, i'd watch every single stream.
This song hits the same sweet spot in my soul as Seagulls Stop It Now and it pleases me  Also somehow this is my second BG3 character's theme song and I was already 30 hours into that run before I saw this video...
I havent played DnD but this fits perfectly to Baldurs Gate 3 :P
This is the quality content I expect from Tom cardy
Please for the love of good make a full version of this
Probably the single most immaculate bit of short-form DnD-related humor on the internet. Absolutely every part of this is perfect.
Using a drumstick as a flute is so funny for some reason.
And from now on every D&D campaign is going to have at least one bar of "Loot that body" sung at some point in it for the next 20 years.
I want this to play at my funeral
I love Tom so much OMG 💕
Fucken subscribed
Wish I had a friend like Tom
The amount of hours I’ve listened to this on loop is becoming a problem.
Following in the tradition of every d&d greentext story, where there are only two possible rolls: natural 1 and natural 20
Gold! Just comedy gold!
This is the convergence of two of my favorite things! I’m so happy!
I love how unhinged that "SHORT!" yell is lol
I've watched this around 20 times, how did it take me this long to realise Tom's "playing" a drumstick!?
Imma need this to be added to your spotify or I may commit murders.
This is a masterpiece
Okay but this was approx the first party in dnd i ever had.
fastest like ive given thus far
Well technically isn’t the kid still alive? Just in a permanent vegetative state of mind. 😅
I love the rogue nodding along to the tune in the beginning
I've lost track how many times I've watched this now. That 'Bitch' at the end still gets me. 😂
I need this on Spotify. Such a masterpiece🤣
I cannot begin to tell you how much the “*plays flute aggressively* SHORT!” part makes me cry-laugh every time I watch this
Playing BG3 like "Gods... they massacred these poor gnomes..." "LOOT THAT BODY - GOTTA LOOT THAT BODY NOW"
"It's always a kid" ... So that's not the first time it happened?!
I should be able to like this for every time I watch it!
I always get so excited when you post 🤣❤️🤣❤️🤣❤️🤣❤️❤️
This is absolutely amazing, very funny 🤣
YEAH 100%
"My boys are otherwise engaged" is a wonderful turn of phrase. 😂
this is gonna be plenty of people’s introduction to tom and i’m so happy for them 😂😂❤
Need a long version of this xD
the accent gives you a wicked charisma bonus
Tom is fucking brilliant as always,  of course,  but this is goddamn interstellar as far as I'm concerned. Amazing!
I’ve watched this ten times now. Please send help.
For anyone who needs it, the Vicious Mockery starts at 1:00
I NEED THIS ON SPOTIFY PLEAE 🤲🤲
We all must reroll Astarion as a Bard now!
Litteraly the exact opposite of my own bard in bg3 when he misses his attacks. I just make him play luth while the rest of the team just destroy the ennemies 😂
LOOT THAT BODY
Power Word: Manlet
My fav since HYCYBH - amazing
Criminally too short! I Want more!
The face at 1:04 kills me wtff
What are the few videos I immediately put on loop
please tell me your Bard name is “Tom Bardy”
0:56 the confidence of the DM... you can see he was excited about this
I want every single one of these songs on Spotify so badly.
If Bowie was a Bard
This may have become my new favorite of your work with how many times I keep returning to it.
shit I can't get out this song...
The vibe of this entire video perfectly matches the vibe of every D&D session with my group and I love it
1:40 loot that body
FULLY obsessed with the instrumental on this one i cant even express it. GOOD WORK as always
This is beyond gold, I'm going to annoy everyone I know with this video now, cheers, my friends hate me
I'm getting flight of the Conchords vibes. Good shit
This does not surprise me in the slightest
I wish I could be so talented with a drumstick
Rewatched this just a few hours ago and it was #15 on Trending! Now it's #14! How high will it go? Only one way to find out... Hire a chronomancer to check the future for us. Also maybe ask them what the winning lotto numbers are while we're at it, but that's only if they have time afterwards.
Where's the sequel song titled "You don't FIND any traps..."'?
> it's always a kid So, it is far from the first time smt like that happened. The bard learns nothing
Welp boys we have a new meme picture to work with 1:05
So uh... Nobody gonna talk about how... he somehow rolled a nat 20 on Vicious Mockery XD
The drumstick as a flute is killing me 😂
Bars
Do red flags but with the girl full song
The IMMEDIATE realization on the DM’s part as soon as he says “yes” is disturbingly relatable.  You can pretty much sense the avarice and curiosity radiating off your players when they ask questions like this and it’s almost as if they’ve shed their human guises and revealed themselves to be a pack of goblins in a trenchcoat the entire time.
Someone's playing Baldur Gate 3
It's Good to be Chaotic 👍
Tom thats not a d20 that is a coin.
I don't know who you are, I don't know what the fuck this is, but it's the best thing I've seen in my life.
*[Lyrics]* # description of the setting, and failed battle preparations, with the exception of the bard # I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes, these muthafuckas mean to harm us, and they got to go - so come on, get 'em now  you picked the wrong day, to fuck around with my Tight. Crew. 'Oa, OA'  There's no escapin it, I can perceive you, here's what we're gonna do *another sick flute riff*  me and the boys gonna mess you up I rolled a 1, I rolled a 1, *FUCK*  my boys are other-wise engaged, so i'm gonna bring it all myself - Hey~ # description of their opponents - one is short- I CAST VICIOUS MOCKERY NAT 20 LETS GO #  you're a short muthafucka, and nobody likes you *Cool Flute 2* SHORT everybody says, "look how fucking short that guy is", and that stops you from forming meaningful relationships  when you were born, everybody thought that you were just a head, but then-the-doctor-said 'Wait - this stupid muthafuckin tiny short ass baby got a tiny little itty bitty body and I hate it' # description of the attack landing, the identity of the individual destroyed, and the bard's innocuous question #  Yes. ...Don't- LOOT THAT BODY GOTTA LOOT THAT BODY NOW LOOT THAT BODY gonna loot that muthafucka play my flute, when i loot that dead kid's body # Last Flute Play #  Bitch.
I always enjoy the effort you put in with different characters. From different clothes, to mannerisms.  Looting the body... here I was, thinking the body would just be carried back for the reward. 😂
.... Right? .... 😊
I'm so happy you did some d&d content
Gotta love vicious mockery
Please made more epic bard adventure musical 😂 this is gold
I sent it to my shirt friend and i think he's mad 😭
Its been a long time since i seen this kind of fun music from any disney or pixar music let alone dnd role play 😂
YES
why does it stop aaaaaa
This slaps hard, I need more of this :D Me looking for more : "Active perception check" *rolls D20*
Yo tengo money 👍🥵
There are so many clips of this that I'm instantly uploading to my D&D group's Discord soundboard. Thank you Tom!
Yo Tom, you want to come to my game? I’m serious.
To be fair 🎶“Loot that body!”🎶 is FAR from the worst follow up from a stereotypical Human Bard to the question “his body’s just lying there, right?”
This is so good, dude.
Hi! That guy here! Vicious Mockery is a save spell not attack spell. :P *Zoidberg runs before getting things thrown at*
Ok you win. Best short story hands down
I'm looking forward to the Tom Cardy D&D extended universe in song
I was having a bad day and this video just made everything better.
How many likes can I give this video ?😂
I just so happen to be a tiefling bard in my campaign and this is exactly the chaotically stupid shit that I have done
Now im running viscous mockery cos this song 🤣
As a non-DND player, I went through three phases watching this video, a total of three times: 1. What the f*ck is this shotpost and why are we "looting dead kids' bodies"? 2. Scrolling through the comments for context and understanding what happened and why he was yelling things  3. This is a masterpiece shitpost, but why are we looting kids' bodies? 😭
This is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time. Love it.
So good! :) lol
How did Tom get video footage of all my DnD sessions ever?
The foot wiggle over the child corpse looting really brings the whole thing together. Bravo
does freezo know you used his likeness in this way?
I can't stop watching this 😂
more! 😂
As a DnD player, this is almost all of my campaigns that I'm in XD
"Youre a short motherfucker and nobody likes you, *flute solo*, SHORT!" thats the bit that always gets me. What a tuuune Tom.
Okay I gave it a day in case it was just the weed, but no, this might be the funniest thing I've ever seen 😂
This is it.  This is every D&D session ever, by law of averages.
Fantastic
Let's fucking go!
Absolutely amazing! Kid totally deserved it.
The brilliance of this cannot be denied. Reminded me of some of the best D&D sessions I was ever lucky to be a part of.
I really wanna play dnd with TC now…all bard party
I know i say this about every new song but like- this is just art
so we're getting a longer version of this song in your next spotify album right?
"It's always a kid"  Meaning this isn't the first time this bard has killed a kid. Why am I not shocked?
This NEEDS to be a downloadable song lol
Love it! But technically you don’t roll to cast Vicious Mockery, the enemy rolls a saving throw 🤓
The fuck this is funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You find a teddy bear, a sheet of math homework, and a pair of Christmas shoes for the NPC's dying mum.
Cheese knees
This was hilarious and convinced me to just make a bard class. I was hoping for a longer song to keep on going lol.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen
spotify link pls 😭😭
The proper way to listen to any new Tom Cardy song is to right click the video and loop it! You catch new details and expressions nearly every watch :) This has been our house jam for the last day!
I need this for Spotify, Apple Music, and a custom LP ASAP
Confirmed Smokin’ Joe was a Bard PC?
Casts Vicious Mockery and rolls an attack roll. I was really hoping that he actually plays dnd but this shows me that he doesn't since it's a Wisdom save from the enemy that needs to be rolled
The virgin “I learned how to play the lyre and I’m singing a old timey song with D&D themes”  The _CHAD_ “im in a tank top and boxers but check out this sick flute”
So, this is great - as always - but how much is this just Tom hoping to be invited on the next season of Dimension 20 ;)
Please send help, I can't stop listening. I need to sleep.
Someone send this to Sam Reigal!
This is an absolute banger.
Rule number one of watching Tom cardy: any water you try to drink can and will go down the wrong pipe
My next Bard's instrument is going to be a single drumstick.
GOAT.  Now I'm singing "loot that body" all around the house! 🤣🤣🤣
Why are you so good at music?
You are very talented.
Yeah our paladin sent me (bard) this one entirely out of the blue this morning and I cannot stop laughing - you're my favorite human right now 😂
As someone who will spend his weekend DMing a campaign and playing another one, this is the best prep I can image
1:04 just fucking slays me...SHORT
pure genius!
The more I watch it the more I love it
WHY IS THIS SO CATCHY
I passed my perception check. That's a drumstick, not a flute!
This is gold.
an instant fave
Loot. that. body
I feel the question of "His body is just lying there, right?" in my gosh darn SOUL. You just KNOW they're up to something when they ask these seemingly innocent questions... Great song!
Happened to my buddy Richard once
noble wuz here
Since Tom can apparently create sick bangers with every instrument known to man, I propose he makes a song with a theremin
Just subscribed to dragon friends. Let's go! Obsessed with your musical comedy. Tom Cardy for president of earth!
OH NO I CRIT FAILED MY WISDOM SAVE
I don't know anything about D&D, and I still laughed my butt off! 😂
The way he says perception check omg hahahahaha so good
The flute finger spin is mega skillzzz. How many takes ? :D
Creative and funny, laughed out multiple times, great video!
I do now what my next character will be
I need more short adventures with this bard and company!
Is that a drumstick he's using as a flute?
He literally doesn’t miss.
this is amazing
This is hysterical, and it's not just because I started a bard air head character in BG3. This is absolutely accurate. 🤣
holy fuuuuck just when i thought i couldn't love you and your music more you put out this absolute banger that's super relevant to my interests?? 😱😩
Oh God this beautiful man coming out here with another beautiful song
I really love the idea of you playing a Bard and coming up with songs on the fly while playing a wooden flute. I need to see this.
This is legitimately the funniest thing I've seen all year.
I'm just gonna say it, Tom is *Bardcore*
EVERY D&D GAME EVER! 😂👍🏻
Gonna be the pedantic cunt to point out that Vicious Mockery doesn't have an attack roll, but rather the target gets a Wisdom saving throw, so no nat 20 or chance to crit. Also only does 1d4 but can go up to 4d4 at level 17. So my head canon here is that your bard is a full level 20 near-godlike adventurer and just unleashed hell on this child. As you should; probably the kind of kid to lose a ring at a wedding.
Haven't laughed so hard in so long😂
Pleasantly happy as usual with your videos ❤
Please make a full
When your murder hobos have the strength of smooth jazz backing them up. 🧐
F****** hilarious
True art as never seen before
OMG this is fucking awesome!
This song is too SHORT.
This gets funnier with every watch. There are so many amazing small choices made that are all hilarious. Bravo.
When you're such a nerd that you lnow vicious mockery is not an attack roll and instead a wisdom save so rolling a 20 would actually do nothin- 🤓☝️
The actual anger that went into “SHORT” 😂
💯🤍 FUNNY👱🏻👌🏻🔥❤️💪🏻
I NEED AN ANIMATIC OF THISSSS
Absolute masterclass
Oh my gosh I would kill for a DND musical
Well done tom! Love that someone else is playing this game and wasting their life away like me
A FORGIVING GOD  God is a forgiving God, let the people who both believe and don't believe come to this knowledge.  When we know the love of God in our lives, we will know that God that we serve is Forgiving. So that our fear and self condemnation will stop.  When we make mistakes as a Christian run to God and not from him.  Beyond his instructions, God is loving. God does not tolerate sin, but he forgives them.  The forgiveness nature of God can clean our sins, show us mercy and restore all back into us.  Psalm 130:3 God does not judge us by our past.  Daniel 9:9 In our Lord, our God, there is mercy and forgiveness.  Don't conclude on others, because God can still wipe all their sins and give them a new life.  A forgiving God is worth following, he can forgive our guilt, our shame, our sin. He looks beyond all that we are, we have done and show us mercy.  Psalm 51:15 The only way to receive forgiveness is to be humble and have a sincere heart.  Sinners are those who make mistakes, those who miss the mark, those who are living in sin, those who are living in their mistakes and errors, those who have so many weaknesses  Rebels don't receive forgiveness. Those who are against God, against the will of God and against the purpose of God. Anti Christ . satan is a rebel for he is against God. Don't be a rebel.  There is hope for a sinner, but there is no hope for a rebel.  Let us repent and return to God, so that he may wash away our sins and forgive us too, and teach us to serve him in spirit and in truth.  Therefore let us come to God with a humble and sincere heart. Asking for forgiveness and help from God to change us in our walk with him.
Lol so good
How did this show up in my suggestions just a week after I found the Dragon Friends podcast? It's not like my web browser knows what RSS feeds my VLC app is subscribed to… on a different machine and operating system! Time to binge years of DnD to catch up!
1:18 absolutely hilarious vid but that bassline is no joke
Amazing as always... but how did you roll a 20 on vicious mockery when it's a a save spell, not a to hit? Everything else checks out as far as any bard I've played
On one hand, I love this, absolute masterpiece. On the other hand, as the forever DM, I am going through 'Nam flashbacks right now
You have perfectly captured the vibes of a D&D session in less than two minutes.  Bravo.
chaotic neutral bard, lets gooo
I literally cried when he said started singing “loot that body”, I knew it was coming somehow.
Never dissapoints to make any situation into a banger of a song
This is a work of art
where's the 10 hour version?
omg this id the funniest shit ever. I dont need to laugh for a week thanks to this
god how is this so fuckin GOOD
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO IN THE WHOLE WORLD I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING
So accurate to how ZF play DND.
The DM’s eyebrow work is incredible, just astonishing, throughout
> "I cast Vicious Mockery, Nat 20, let's go" Erm, actually, Vicious Mockery is a saving throw not an attack roll so the ENEMY would be rolling, NOT the Bard 🤓
It's the "SHORT!" that gets me every time! XD
Best drumstick-flutist known to man. An instant classic as always.
Yeah I’m going to need at least three more of these D&D parodies. Thank you for your immaculate work as always Tom
VICIOUS MOCKERY ISN'T A CHECK ON THE CASTER ITS A SAVE ON THE TARGET
the reason i picked bard
I wanna get into dnd even more now
So, um, this was shared around my D&D group because it more-or-less mirrors something that happened to us. There was this NPC that we *really* needed to talk to. He sicced his guards on our bard before he could use his high CHR to get the info we needed. They nearly killed the bard in their first hit. Everyone was rolling fairly badly. But the bard rolled a nat 20 on a check to cast Cloud of Daggers through the window of the NPC's escaping coach. It turned out that this guy was really weak. By the time our half-orc stopped the coach, there was mincemeat in the carriage. The bard calmly stepped up and looted the body, finding a key. Laughing maniacally the whole time. I. Was. That. Bard.
but vicious mockery is a wis save
Accurate XD
vicious mockery isn't roll to hit, it's a wisdom saving throw     I had to do it, sorry, i still love the song
I would give my right or left testicle to get an extended version of this song.       You can have your choosing, but you can't have both.
I can't stop watching this.
You realize this means we need a "Nat 20 Let's Go!" shirt, right?
*"Please brave adventurers, help us! Our  temples sacred macguffin is missing!"*  Tom Bardy: "Have you checked your butthole?"
Australian bards are just on a different level, dang
As a short guy listening to this, It really made me fail my saving throw
SPOTIFY PLEASE!
Bard in real life
Been paying bg3, so hilarious casting vicious mockery nat 20! He's a child! Loot that dead child's body!
The bard always carries Be it a lyrical tune or the critical failure of a team
I didn’t think I could enjoy you more and then you did this! 😂😂😂
......My friend sent me this....I played a drow bard like this...
of *course* Tom Cardy would be a bard 😂
"Loot that muthafukkah!"
I would love to have those flute sounds, it'd be perfect for my d&d campaign. Can just randomly play some at any time and annoy people.
I have been listening to this on repeat for almost 3 hours now
This is one of the best things I've ever seen. Bravo.
These songs are just so random and I love it 😂
I'm gonna mod this into baldurs gate as the opening music
This song is a deep stab to my short person chest in the funniest way possible.
Natural 20.... Let's fucking go.
This had much better music than it does when things go this horribly wrong for my rpg group on the regular.  Funnier, too.
This feels too real to not be something he experienced
Loot that body!
Your name may be Tom Cardy, but in my heart you'll always be HYCYBH-guy
I absolutely love your stuff and this tune in particular is really good.  I was about to correct you about the Vicious Mockery, because in D&D E5, the target has to succeed on a wisdom saving throw, and not you roll a spell attack, but I guess Baldur's Gate does it differently.
Every time I hear this song it gets better
This was so goood 😂
Earned yourself a sub. I cried laughing.,. thank you sir
It would be rude not to loot
Can you do a video where the chaotic bard ruins someone with Hideous Laughter? I feel like this as a part 2 would be amazing.
I know nothing about DND but holy crap this was hilarious 😂 the flute just makes this so much more funny 😂
U the best
Took me way to long to realize his "flute" is a drum stick. 😂
*sweats* *pushes glasses up* Um, ackchewally Vicious Mockery is a Wisdom Save
I love the accent.
Hey guys we found the sequel to Flight of the Conchords
Ah, D&D in a nutshell
Hey Tom, you’re invited to my next campaign 😂
Another in the top ten easily, holy fuck
Where's my spotify, apple music, etc version?
This is a masterpiece
This is sooo funny ahahahhahahhh I love it
full song when?????
I love love love Bards xD
This is my new favorite video :)
Best use of Vicious Mockery since Lin-Manuel Miranda made fun of a robot
how do I buy this song right now??. RIGHT NOW
Viscious words came out of the bard's ass
ahh... The true bard experience
That's really extraordinary! Please more of this! D'n'D is really going smoothly with your artstyle! <3
incredible. as a fan of d20 show, just incredible
I can't believe Tom plays RPGs. How did i not know this?
Speaking for bard mains, you just earned my sub. Only the best rolls for the worst situations 😂
Thanking you for these fine additions to the D&D discord soundboard.   LOOT THAT BODY !
I cannot stop laughing at this, and it's so catchy lmao
This might have inspired me to start a bard Dark Urge playthrough in BG3 where his main instrument is a flute
The face DM Tom has at 00:21 makes me think it is not the first time Bard Tom messes with the campaign.
1:01 goes so hard
I don't recall seeing you at the last murder hobo session, Tom.
Do this again. I need this same song but again
I haven't laughed so much in a while now. Thank you very much for this, it's wonderful.
OMG WHENEVER ANYBODY ASKS WHAT DND IS THIS IS WHAT I'LL SHOW THEM NOW
We need a full song of this!! PLEASE.
Finally! Dnd song content from my favorite youtube musician! <3
Bro didn’t even try to figure out intentions and straight up obliterated the child and main objective in one fell swoop, and then had the audacity to loot him. Truly a chaotic evil moment.
Your bard's nat 20 managed to hit us with Hideous Laughter through our screens, I was rolling laughing from this video. :D
And that my friends is why you wait for the DM to finish describing the scene when you roll a natural 20 perception.
the DM’s face when he sees a 20 lmao
😂❤
i love the idea of the group's bard casually shredding the flute while being a cocky dickhead during adventures and on the road lol
This is something.
Average bard interaction
Give this man everything he wants now.
1:44 the way I looked at the word 'mutha7ka' and relistened to the song to count that 'fuck' in some way, shape, and form was, indeed, sang seven times
Yeah that's d&d all right 😂
This is precisely why I play bard. Vicious fuckery.
i saw this on twitter and i just HAD to find it on youtube and comment... this is SOOOOOOOOOOOO good. i am hooked. i frankly want more DND songs from you (im begging)
He vicious mockery a poor kid to death so many times that he knows right on bat what DM is going to say. And of course he gonna loot that muthaforka 🤣
Haha love the DnD remarks 😄
Muthafucka, a genius!
haha so good..... can't believe he looted :P
I love the implication that the bard has killed several children by mocking them for being short
Please where can I get this song
I must have rolled a 1 on my perception check, because I'm on my 4th or 5th time through, and just noticed his flute is a drumstick
what mic do you use
Proof that there are bards and there are Bards.
This slaps hard and all the better has no business doing so, I love it!   PLEASE continue to develop this into a longer song!
You killed the boy in the shadow cursed lands, didn't you?
Who are you romancing (or trying to) Tom? The people need to know who you're trying to smooch in BG3.
0:45
I'm loving it, i just started play dnd as a bard too XD
M
I thought your best video was Red Flags. Not anymore.
I want a flute like that
Please, someone explain this song to non-DnD nerds, who don't know anything about the game 🤔
Loot that body describes me perfectly lol
Is there anything Tom can't do? Try AFOLs next ❤
I need more of these please and thank you
❤❤
Did anyone else get some serious Mighty Boosh vibes? Fucking beautiful.
Full song please
Someone needs to send the vicious mockery to Charlie 😭 I love him but I also love when the community messes with him
God damn that song is an instant bop
The fact that i wake up after playing my bard character to this
I almost bursted a mouthful of food into the monitor :D
We need a full song!!!
I rolled a nat 20 on perceiving 'the flute.'
Awesome
This is perfectz
You could tell from the terminology used that they actually play the game. Not just stuff picked up from baldurs gate.  What a fucking bop this is
Legit the funniest thing I've ever seen. It's worryingly relatable 😂
Don Quixote would be proud
Loved it, keep up the great work
Not looking at the board in the background that says “cheese knees” lol
The fact he made an attack roll on a spell that is a saving throw doesn't even bother me in the scheme of the rest of the video and song. Absolutely love this song, I've been listening to it in repeat for hours!😂
D&D nerds ignoring the concept of house rules: ThAtS nOt In ThE bOoK. D&D nerds who understand house rules: LOOT THAT BODY, GOTTA LOOT THAT BODY NOW.
relatable-
Perfection.
NAT 20 LET'S GOOOOO
Please do make this a full length song this is such a banger!
I rolled a 1. I rolled a 1. FUCK made me cackle so hard 😂
BG3 taught me that I'm apparently a murder hobo, so the "loot that body" bit hits so incredibly hard.  "Oh, I failed that persuasion check? Time to murder and take your shit."
tom cardy's melody has something special inspiration. we will get new song!! yeahyy love your contents
So cool video❤❤❤
"it's always a kid" So that's happened more than one time🥲
Suggested alternate title: "Scanlan"
"It's always a child" implies that he makes fun of children on a regular basis. Good on you, Tom.
Played DnD since highschool and this is hilarious! Love your comedic timing, absolute blast💫
Tom Cardy is short for Thomas Cardinal.
Another song to replay 1000 times. Hit after hit Sir Cardy. ❤
But is he as wide as a Westfield door?
Why is it blinking so much?
I love how I understood all the terms since I just started D&D with friends and could absolutely empathise with the jokes since our fighter and ranger roll natural 1's all the time too 😂 My barbarian and my bestie's bard are carrying the team tbh lmao edit: typo
Murder Hobo gunna hobo... not mater what class :p
Nailed the perception checks but not the insight check
this comment goes out to all the RPers who have definitely sent this to their group chat today
toms songs are better than standup comedys for my broken soul
Damn that Vicious Mockery is so powerful that it hurt my vertically challenged ass irl.
😂😂😂 loot dat bodyyyy
"It's always a kid" ...means this is not the first time it happens. This motherfucker goes around town sniping all the children around and I love it
The acting and way Tom yells "short" at 1:04 absolutely kills me. He's so committed to it. Man needs to get on the horn with the Hemsworth's and make a comedy because the acting skill is there.
I love the reactions of the crew when the GM announced the bard mocked a child to death. The Barbarian: Damn, that guy so powerful he didn't even use a weapon The Rogue: We were looking for a kid?!
OH MY GOD you are into DnD! My life is complete.
This is… devastatingly real
01:04 THAT FELT PERSONAL
0:43 the masterful pacing on the lyrics as the party lands multiple crit fails is both fantastic as well as incredibly ironic
Every D&D session ever.
I want a full version
I love how at the beginning when the others are making their rolls, the bard is just playing his flute in the wings, waiting for his moment.
Fcking hilarious
Watched this too many times today, never and WILL NEVER get old
Magnificent.
Absolutely no one is surprised that Tom is a Bard (but we're so happy to get it confirmed!!!)
I love the vibes this video radiates
Holy shit thats so good, I wish i could like more
So how okay is it to create gifs from this video? Because I am creating like 20 of them and using them in my D&D discord 😂
The fact that you cant "nat 20" a vicious mockery, because it is not an attack but a saving throw makes this song more accurate not less.
Tom rolled a nat 20 on the number of instruments he can play.
The Ballad of the Murder-Hobo... nailed it, Tom! Nat 20!
"it's always a kid"  fckin murderhobos man.
Perfectly personified the bard 😂
Tom doing songs about DnD? What is this, a freebie from a genie? Holy shit. Please keep doing as many as you can cause its fucking amazing
Of fkng course a bard rolls a Nat 20
It's a very good and catchy song and I'm sure I'm going to be using "I cast Vicious Mockery. SHORT!" for ages to come, but I have to unfortunately be a D&D pedant: critical fails and critical successes don't apply to skill checks, only attack rolls!  Okay, I got that out of my system back to playing this on repeat.
The DM knew this wasn't a dangerous encounter, and yet he still winced in pain when Tom got a nat 20 on perceiving the group, because he knew how Tom would carry on when given that much power.
fuck this guys creative hahah
This is literally my bard mood
Suddenly I wanna play d&d with tom
the way the teo other olayers are wearing headphones makes the bard seem like the DMs annoying little brother who plays in the same room as the dm while everyone else joins in a dnd discord call
as a bard myself, i’d just like to say this is beautiful and i’m going to show all my friends this
Most of your songs deal with insane behavior. This song shares normal D&D murder hobo behavior. Which probably says something about how each song presents us with a reality free of long term consequences.
I'm just here for the music and the loads of people saying "Vicious Mockery is a Saving Throw"
🧸
This music is a Nat 20 roll every time
not enough songs end with a flute solo and a venomous "bitch!"
This is another one of those tom cardy songs that feel like were inspired by an incredibly real event in Tom's life
Loot that body! Got me real good, almost choked 😂
As someone who worked on Baldur's Gate 3 (I did the flute version of the bard) and kept sending Tom vids to co-workers throughout the production of BG3, this is pretty amazing and made my day.
10/10
i saw this. then i watched like 50 of these videos for the next couple hours. amazing stuff. such BM.
He died of embarrassment, he's not gonna use it. Loot him up.
"danm the bodys just lying there right?" <- feeling that every dnd player gets right befor they roll to.  loot that shit
Can we have a YouTube shorts with "You´re a short motherfucker and nobody likes you! Short!"? Please?
happy holidays
This is the most accurate D&D experience XD
The best part for me is when he viciously plays flute for half a second and then yells "SHORT!" with a grimace
You've done it, this is your masterpiece!
I need an epic, double-album of Tom's D&D songs.
I've watched this at least 5 times today and every time I laugh so hard I cry. 😂
I fucking died at his face when saying loot that mathafucka hahaha
" *Fuck* "  I felt that.
I only just realized on my 6th replay that the flute is a freakin drumstick. My brain just accepted Mr. Tom Cardy can bullshit play a flute and just say "Hey, that looks and sounds about right."
I am clearly playing the wrong class
tom and D&D, truly a dream came true.
Took me a while to realise but this has such big Flight of the Conchords energy and it makes me love it even more
I chose to clock this video over Taylor Swift
Was that last second a Lizzo reference?
Your musical talent mixed with your lyrical genius never ceases to amaze me! You're the best 🧡
The whole table must be rolling those special nat 20/nat 1 dice, just only the most intense options
Found a campaign with Tom! https://youtu.be/yFiPeT4Y23A?si=4wgcioC5zUQZRHfi
I WANT THIS ON SPOTIFY NOW
This brings me a lot of joy. Thank you.
That fuck came from the soul
I'm always like "damn. can this guy be any cooler?" And it turns out he plays dnd? Hell yeah
it was inevitable
I didn't know Tom was a murder hobo but that seems to suit him.
I needed this... I used to fuck around on my zelda ocarina playing as my bard
Absolute gold
I relate to this as a chronic high-roller that gets way too invested in how my character would act to consider logical action. It's great my table loves playing with me
To all Aussies out there like myself🤠 👇
as i listened I just kept imagining Scanlan Shorthalt from Critical Role. He would totally do something like that. He once took a shit in the Temple of Sarenrae so he could use scrying on the poo and spy on his crush.
I cant get over Tom just yelling SHORT 1:03 😭
Finding out you’re doing an AP is the best thing I have heard all week. Comics playing RPGs are legit my favourite media.
We all just gonna accept that he treated vicious mockery with the caster doing a check instead of the creature doing a Saveroll?
Brings back memories of when the DM kept getting annoyed that most of our party just wanted to stay in the inns and taverns, get drunk and roll charisma checks to chat up the bar maid. Quest? Nah. I still haven't spent my last dead body loot yet.
I did not know I needed a combination of Dungeons and dragons and tom cardy in my life , but my god im glad it exists
My favorite part by far is   "Me and ma boys are gonna mess you up!"  (I rolled a 1.)x2  *FUCK*
FIIREE
🎵 LOOT THAT BODY! 🎵  Oh my God 😂😂😂 ☠️☠️☠️
Yes!
wooohoo! its a d&d video 🤩🤩🤩 Now Tom’s ascended to truly legendary status
Oh my god. I need to add this to my d&d playlist!!!!
This is my favorite one yet!!! Ahahaha i love your videos so much 😂😂😂 hubby and i dance to them while cooking hehehe
"Its always a kid-"  *HES DONE THIS BEFORE??*
This could be Scanlan Shorthalt's theme song  Incredible work lmao
"you're a short motherfucker and nobody likes you" 🔥
This is hilariously accurate
Oh I recognize this player! 😅
I was laughing so hard listening to this that I had a customer come check on me and see if I was okay. 😂 now he's laughing too!
This is a party that only rolls 1s and 20s.
LOOT. THAT. BODY. So accurate.
He's a bard. What did you expect? Look at him, barding all over. The DM knew what he was getting himself into, and it's admittedly quite funky.
As a perpetual DM I found this both unbelievably funny and also my thousand yard stare of player bullshit PTSD this triggered made the last two minutes quite the mental ride. How much psychic damage do I need to roll for now?
SHORT
Damn Tom you are playing my favorite class and giving it homage with this vid 🎉🎉🎉
I love you with my whole soul.  No matter how gray the sky, how shitty the day, how grim life seems to be, what you do always brings a smile to my face
Yay
Ok I laughed so much that everybody in the train looked at me. Thank you but no thank you xD  The bard looks so bored AF at the beginning until he can do his chaotic stuff xD
“It’s always a kid” I love the idea that Tom has verbally attacks kids without second thought cause he thought they were just short people
Tom Bardy
I swear every now and then he makes a tune or song that just kills you with laughter and I love it
Tom is straight up a wellspring of unbelievable high-quality high jinx 😂
HOLY SHIT.
"My boys are otherwise engaged"😂
I haven't laugh so uncontrollably in a long time, jeezus 😂
The absolute pop off with the flute is amazing lmao
Holy shit, it's the new Leeroy Jenkins!
Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. USA! BITCH! https://youtu.be/ZjlYFWLUDBQ?si=8RgcGEHoetEb695t&t=108
I play a bard and now I realize I play a bard wrong.
The little flute riff before yelling "SHORT!" has me in stitches
I sent it to my boyfriend who was in a DnD campaign. His DM might hate me now but! Totally worth it
More.  MORE!!!
1:47 the little jig followed by the "bitch" kills me every time 🤣
TOM GUEST APPEARANCE ON DIMENSION 20 OR OTHER BRENNAN LEE MULLIGAN INTERACTION WHEN
Tom, are you more of a MURDERhobo or a murderHOBO?
😂😂😂
Can we just get a Flight of the Concords style show with Tom already.
Oh FUCK yeah, 1000% checking out thw podcast ASAP. Also, great song. 🤌💜
Man this made my day and knowing you play and is probably a CHA based character just made it even better  Didn't even need foresight to prepare you for melee
Typical DnD stuff, you know how it be
"Me and my boys gonna mess you up!" "I rolled a one" "I rolled a one" "FUCK!" That is the most DnD thing I've heard in a while
I love this song so much, just been listening to it on loop for a while XD DND Chaos YES!!! <3
Somebody asked me at the table during this week’s session what makes Bards good. Now I have this awesome video to share as well.
Please lute my body bish 👁️👄👁️
Can't stop watching this on repeat. Why is this so damn good? Haven't even touched BG3 yet. xD
I laughed pretty hard listening to this and then I started reading the comments and literally started crying from laughter
The crossover I never expected, of two things I love: Tom Cardy and Tabletop RPGs.
kskakskskajsjekisjsjdoajskkdksks i edge to this iaksisoajaisajjajaoajajsow
watch the DND babies get baited
The implications of "It’s always a kid isn't it" 😂
H.S. - Inspiring, Uplifting, Motivational Perception Check - I cast vicious mockery on the short person  you can't ever predict what the next cardy song will be like
I now have something to sing while I loot bodies, thank you Tom.
Tom Cardly misses with these slappers
I’m gonna be singing “LOOT DAT BODAYYY” for the rest of my life
As an actual short person, I just took 5d10 splash damage from your vicious mockery
This song has driven me to want to play at one of your tables. I need to witness such beautiful nonsense firsthand. I don't care if I'm the player or DM. I will gladly continue to be a forever DM for the opportunity.
tom manifesting his bard magic by turning his drumstick into a flute
He totally played bg3 or something and went “hey Phineas I know what we’re gonna do today!”
I want more of these DnD musical😂
I would do unspeakable things to have Tom in my D&D game as a bard
Damn this song slaps hard! Looking forward to more bardic songs like this. <3
the DM made 2 mistakes. 1: running the cinematic like a combat encounter let his players jump the gun. 2: admitting it was the kid they were looking for. Coulda just said it was a short bandit and tried again.
SHORT
this is it  jesus christ this is it
Oh my God you killed me 😂
Cheese knees has me all kinds of curious
Videos like this just make my day. 🙇‍♂
oh WOW I needed that laugh. Good one, man.
"You're a short mother f*cker and nobody likes you... SHORT" I immediately sent this to all my short friends.
I just sent this to my DND loving brother, and this is what he sent back...  "Not to be that guy but technically vicious mockery requires the enemy to make a saving throw so he wouldn't be able to nat 20 on an attack. *pushes glasses up nose* "  Seriously though this kicks ass, I love you Tom (and the signed record I got)
the real live bard has arrived to save humanity from all whats not obsolet
I hope to God we get not a cop treatment for this golden master piece.
pretty accurate depiction of the average game session)
honestly just a skill issue on the DM's part. should've just bullshitted that the kid was the bard's long lost son so as not to set the party back too far story-wise :)
I'm dying!!!!  😂
Of course your awesome extended right into d&d...
I laughed so hard at this. As a bard who bought a recorder specifically to serenade my campaign, I approve
There are a lot of hilarious details in this stupendous song, but the "flute" being a drumstick is my favorite 😂
Why dont you upload to spotify as much?
literally just discovered your music like a week ago and was like "wow this guy rules" but now you bring D&D into it? it just keeps getting better :^)
Absolute banger.
This is so damn funny you'd almost get a pass from me for being a murder hobo in my gaming group.  Almost.
it's so fucking catchy, I can't stop watching, this is peak nerd story telling.
I love how Tom says "child" at the same time as the DM, as though this is a common occurrence.
"mutha7ka" makes me laugh so much i don't know why
It's Tom's dead stare before playing the first note on the flute for me
😂😂😂
Hahaha loved it the ones were perfect❤
Can I just say that the beat that this song throws down is an absolute banger, and the flute is perfect, ha!
Heyyy, it's Hot Roddy from Rude Tales of Magic!!
I've never sent something to my dnd group faster
Dude I've literally just been getting into dimension 20 lmao
I actually just finished a campaign where my characters name was Tomathy Cardimum and this was his exact personality
I’m gonna go out on a limb and guess that Tom’s been playing a little Baldur’s Gate 3.
Tom what does Cheese Knees mean? WHAT DOES IT MEAN TOM
Cheese knees?
S H O R T
Literally stopped playing BG3 just to listen to this. You epic chaotic bard.
I was on the verge of breaking down tonight but then I saw the title and thought it was going to be about some song about mental health and thought "Oh I can use that right about now." and then it was a song about my favorite game of all time made me forget all about what I was about to break down about and started laughing instead. Thanks Tom.
Great song XD Also dang not a very good Dungeon Master huh?
Yes.
yo he plays d&d
I LOVE THIS OH GOD
Perfect timing. Just started getting into DnD, and listening to Tom Cardy. THE STARS ARE ALIGNED
Just yelling "short"  is a brutal use of VM
The most unrealiostic part of this song is 15 days game time 5 days of our actual lives, i have a whole  year long campaign thats like a week in game time
Why does this go so hard though
No alignment restrictions on bards, right.
Any of these lyrics on some Merch please ❤
Please keep up this energy with more TTRPG scenarios
As a DM, I felt that... "Don't".
The way he says "It's always a kid" inplies accidental child murder is a frequent occurrence, which isn't at all surprising to hear from a D&D campaign.
Channeling my inner Obi-Wan over this cause of course I know him, he’s me 😅
I'm pretty sure that's exactly how every bard plays Baldur's Gate 3
OMG IT'S 10PM AND WE ARE HOWLING 😂😂😂😂 THANK YOU TOM
Had to watch this 4 times then immediately send to all my medical friends. We’re nerds aaaand we curse a lot 😂
This is a masterpiece.
Best advertisement for d&d I’ve ever seen
This shit brings me so much joy.
Nat 20 performance!
my entire baldurs gate 3 playthrough in under 2 minutes
That bch at the end really got me! 😂
Tom this is unreasonable 😂😂😂😂😂
This is Art.
finally, the flute enters the TCCU (tom cardy cinematic universe)
I bust a gut laughing. And then I got to "he's just lying there, right?" Knew it was coming, and still burst out into uncontrollable laughter again, anyway.
Hi
this is why my first playthrough of BG 3 was a bard.
The aggressive flute is everything to me
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That "bitch" in the end made me laugh so much 🤣
I am adding you to my campaign as an NPC. This is non-negotiable
Classic Bard.
You know...between this video, clips from that College Humor group, and books like Vermis, this D&D stuff seems like a lot of fun!
If a nat 20 was rolled on a vicious mockery... the baby saved. It's coming back as a rogue in 15 years.
So good
Full Version PLEEEEEEAAAAASSSEEE!!! 🎉🎉🎉 0:24
ahah, that flute spin editing, we saw it Tom, we saw it : D
Today I joined a D&D Club at my highschool, Tom was obviously inspired by me lol
the most chaotic evil bard ever
i sent this to my dad who loves D&D , he had a good laugh and he thanks you for the video !
Boss you killed a child *AMAZING, MISSION COMPLETE*
This reminds me when I was running through a game, the bard had rolled a fucking 20 every time he wanted to drop kick the child npc. And I love it
The fact me and my friends got heavy into D&D recently makes this so much funnier. My friend who is a bard plays exactly like you do
I have definitely failed my save to resist being charmed by Tom.
I honestly didn't think Tom could go any higher in my estimations. And then I learn the man is a bloody dnd enthusiast. Absolute legend, much love xx
i've had games like this  i had to share this with a few friends i used to play with  and the DM's "...yes"  - i felt that in my core
tom why is it that your videos always come at exactly the right time. I've literally been planning out a dnd club. STOP PERCEPTION CHECKING ME TOM ITS NOT OK Edit: I have SPECIFICALLY been planning to play a bard. On a side note I haggled with the DM possibly weeks before the campaign (it has not even started yet) to let me have an immortal corgi to accompany me on my travels. They're being ominous but they have sworn multiple times not to let anything harm my precious darling immortal corgi and if something does happen I will sing christine's high notes from phantom of the opera in an elmo impression until my corgi's most minor to major wounds are healed and the dm begs me to stop just let them TRY TO HARM A BARDS CORGI. Edit 2: I've never actually played DND before. I hope this goes well. For the DM's sake. I have seen the bard memes i will act accordingly roll to seduce is the one sentence I have memorized. Oh? Female guards? ROLL TO SEDUCE Male guards? ROLL TO SEDUCE Dragonborns? ... ok too far hell nah
friggin' genius.
Bloody bards eh?
The way he says "I can percieve you" made me want to pounce on someone like a cat lol
god i love this lmao
At least the bard didn’t try to make love this time
The line "Its always a kid." Makes me assume that they regularly kill short people using vicious mockery just to find that its children.
This is my favorite thing ever, I need a three minute version of this song asap, "Loot that Body" can be the chorus for both verses, it'll be amazing
Dragon Friends is the best DnD podcast out here - fucking hilarious and talented people. Dave hates every player and it's my favorite. OH ALSO this song rules, thank you!
lol
WE NEED RED FLAGS UNO REVERSE FULL PLEASE
THIS IS SO GOOD!
❤
wake up babe, new tom cardy song just dropped
First
Im about to play my first round dnd and also chose to be a bard  and that song song genuinely made me exited for it 🤣  Edit: 1 year later, I finally slowly understand the game and once my baby dragon hetches, shits gonna go down haha XD
CHEESE KNEES
Not how vicious mockery works. And on the first nat 20 perception check he would have seen that one of them was a kid.
Now I want to see you play DND ❤
the look on your face when you shout SHORT is priceless
The fucking riff at the end dude I can't I'm dead 😂😂😂
i love u music wizard (make another album now)
The flute playing gives me such Jethro Tull vibes too, I love it
Does anyone know what is the flute that Tom is using? Suddenly have the urge to get a flute
It’s the single note afterthought flute bits for me
🕺LOOT THAT BODY 🕺
THE BEST THING I SEE, EVER.  IM GOING TO SEE DRAGON FRIENDS, NOW. FUCKING MY OPOSITIONS!
this is scarily accurate to how me and my friend's d&d meetups go though there's usually a lot more arson and my friend dying more times to herself than actual dangers
This is hilarious and so damn catchy! This should be Pardon My Take's theme song when they play Dungeons and Dragons.
Yes.  Just Yes.
The YouTube Algorithm has blessed me this day!
Thanks for making this awesome vid, but also fuck you my party is gonna spam a sound board of  LOOT THAT BODY (GOTTA LOOT THAT BODY NOW) LOOT THAT BODY every encounter from now on.
I'm curious, can you actually play the flute, or is this like the brass wherein you just like to make the funny faces? EDIT: The longer I look at it, the less sure I am that it's even a real flute. I think it might be a dowel. EDIT: Okay, it's definitely a drumstick. Now I feel silly.
Thank you Tom. You're the best funny bom bom
man I wish that I could "like the video" more than once
Yeah this checks out completely. Accidentally killing the NPC you were trying to save is such a core DnD experience
Aight Scanlan... aight 😂
🕺 ✨LoOt ✨ 💃 ✨ ThAt ✨ 🕺 ✨  BoDy ✨ 💃  ✨  NoW ✨ 🕺
"SHORT"  I'll admit it, I snorted full out loud
I cannot wait for the extended version of this track on the next album.
I dont play dnd but man. This was hilarious. May have to change that 😂
This literally made my day 😂
If he rolled a nat 20 on perception he should be able to see that its the child, the child theyve been looking for, the child theyve been specifically hunting for for 5 days, that child
Perfect timing for this release! Just finished my first ever DND character profile!
This was a wonderful surprise today
Although this isn't marked as an "official music video", I really wouldn't mind this one being on the next album. But then again, I've loved literally everything I've heard from Tom.
Hing as a Bard.
I keep listening to this on loop, it's just so joyful. ♡
Pure perfection!
Should have waited for the perspective check to reveal more then short, lol.
Yesss! A d&d song! I used to love playing this game!
Masterful. Makes we want to play D&D.
VICIOUS MOCKERY
The virgin 1d20-cell fears the girthy and engorged 3d6 chad
I will never recover 💀 This was spectacular
I can forgive the mistakes of the game's knowhow for that absolutely realistic reaction to killing a kid in dnd :)
I ugly laughed until I started coughing at this because mooood. Why can't I like this more than once?!
Tom Cardy the Bardy is so talented he can play the flute with a drumstick
Ooh, in real life I'd interrupt your song after the second line with 🤷 https://youtu.be/ciAsltEpCkw?si=lWQ5-HLAmBiw9TVo
WHERE'S YA LINK TO YA FUNNY PODCAST TOM
This is great. I actually found you because I kept listening to you on Dragon Friends.
As a DM I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh or to cry. Great song though
Whoah! this is such a bop. Would you consider showing how you made this or showing an audio file or something?
Despite my overpowering love of yeeting people off cliffs as a rabbit-themed warlock, I'm now tempted by the Bard Class.  I'm gonna have to show this to a mate that's working on a 5e/Pathfinder2e revision/setting for Paizo and WotC, since he got me into Tom Cardy via Mixed Messages.  I can also explain the "rabbit-themed warlock" if anyone's interested. It's silly but awesome.
TOM my friends and I just had our RPG game night last night...this was the perfect thing to share with them today! Btw you're invited for a side quest if you're ever in Alaska :)
I neeeeeed this on Apple music
ahhhhh i love this so much
this one hit a nat 20, let's go
🕺🔥
uH aKctUAllY ViCouS mOCkeERY is a wIsdOM sAve  seriously though love ur stuff man
Looting a dead child. Lucky I'm not a cop so it's none of my business.
Nooo! Over already?? God that was the bestt-
Bard is the only class I actively avoid playing.
No problem, just roll a medicine check to stabilize the kid, and if that fails and he dies, take him to the nearest cleric for a quick rez. No muss, no fuss. (Kid isn't going to have any loot on him though, he's a kid!)
what kind of flute do you use tom, also i LOVE LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU MAKE <3
Someone show this to Freddie Wong IMMEDIATELY lmao
Lmfao - yea that’s usually how it goes.
I just can't get over how fun you seem to be around
Hell yeah what a time to be alive to be a human bard
I don’t understand this - but fucking love it …
Fucking Phenomenal.
I'm a Japanese learning English, I don't get the lyrics but it sounds nice so I keep listening to this
The way you enunciate Motherfucker at the end is incredible
TC: "I cast vicious mockery and roll a Nat 20" DM: "T-that's not how the spell wor-" TC: *flute shit* "I roll persuasion. Nat 20." DM: "What? Oh fuck it, fine"
tHatS nOt hOWe ViCioUs MOckErY wErks!@@!#@!!@#!!
Oh no, two things I enjoy have crashed together. This doesn't bode well for my free time.
gotta loot that mutha7ka broh- 1:44
A new certified bop
wholesome
Let's go another banger from the man himself
I died 😂
This gave me strength
how do you nat20 a vicious mockery? It's save or suck  (i am so sorry, i had to. I'm compulsive. I love this song)
This man is single-handedly revolutionizing the entire Flight Of The ConCore genre
Tom using the term active perception check proves to me that the vicous mockery used an attack roll only because it sounds better in song and not because of a lack of knowledge.
Bard call out the 2 hidden orc behind is team mate but they stare blankly at the bard saying wtf you talking about, there is no one around. But the bard was able to make them draw their weapon half heartedly making them ready to fight but no advantage. I mean both is team mate crited failed. Or bard put is crit on making sure is team is ready or he get advantage on is next attack. :/
You don't roll when cast Vicious Mockery. The victim rolls a saving throw.
Even tom is not safe from BG3 NICE
Are you also playing bard in bldursgate?
Here before 100k 👇
It's always the bard! -- calling out all the party's that group with bard.
I don’t know anything about DND but I know I love this   And that may be  All there is To Know
I love the idea of a DM thinking “I didn’t ask you to roll, because I’m the one making a saving throw but, you know what? Fuck it. Failed quest for you”
This is amazing, once again. So damn groovy haha
Day two of squid boy full song
Tom being on a dnd podcast is amazing and a gift from god
That is how the F I play!
I think we can all agree that Tom’s due to write a full musical that will be a smash hit yeah?
When you're in the groove but the grove demands a _drop_
lol
We need more DnD songs !
Nat 20 performance.
That's the bardic inspiration i needed to start my day. I just got to Act 2 after about 475 hours of play time :)
Scanlan is leaking. I don't know if or what to ...
This is an absolute masterpiece
I just played D&D today. This was perfect!!!
Everyone knows playing a Bard is the true Baldurs experience
Outstanding work.
The fact that every single fucking one of your songs gives me that special feeling of discovering my new favorite TV show must mean something.  Please do the intro for my show if I ever get to produce one (and I will!).
Another masterpiece
Although TC's bard is a horrible person I can't help but notice that he's very positive about his Tight Crew even when they only roll nat 1s. Boy's a team player and respects his friends even when committing war crimes.
This is such a banger
Murder Hobo Bard ahoy
If it wasnt for BG3, i wouldnt understand this, but now im mentally visualizing it in game 😂
I don't think there's a video of yours I don't jam to. I'm going to do a Bard Playerthrough on BG3 and this will guide me through the darkest of times.
Ummmm ackshually, Vicious Mockery is a saving throw, not a hit roll.
New favorite song about DnD
I'm at work listening to this in the background. I might have shattered a rib trying to stop myself from cackling maniacally. Bloody well done m8!
This is getting played at sooooo man roleplaying games for eternity. Nice
HOOOOOHHHH MY GOODNESS, THIS IS THE MOST BARD THING I’VE SEEN ALL YEAR
what is this heresy? default bg3 dice? disgusting. gotta pick one of those other 2 options
PLEASE make this a full song.
I really want to make a D&D Bard based off of Tom
Bard, a flute solo while the team goes full loot goblin
I sent this to my dnd buds who were introduced to vicious mockery by my bard haha
*Yep. This is going straight to my DnD group*
Scanlon be like
As a DM, this video brought me immense psychic damage. Nice work...
Tom finally realizing that his antics are accurate to a typical Bard PC is the greatest thing I have witnessed all week.
This is just the best and what I strive for my bard to be like
I have to know, does Tom just know the flute on top of all his many other instruments, or did he find a flute and learn it just to drop some sick bardcore on us?
I'm sending this to my dnd group right tf now (I'm the bard)
I've never felt so seen before as a dnd player, and as a bard main xDDD that vicious mockery LEGENDARY
That "BITCH" at the end from the bard really sells the whole thing
HE IS FLYING OUT CONTENT, Keep up the good work
Scanlan being wild as usual
This made my day
Absolutely perfect. I can't wait to listen to Dragon Friends and catch up on the good times that gave you this Bardic Inspiration.
"The body's just lying there right?" "Don't..."
this is great
we need uno reverse complete version 😿
OMG!! Fantastic!! ❤
This entire clip is a charm person spell and Ive failed my save.
The fact that I have a Steve in my dnd crew escalated this so much.
So no more songs for a while since BG3 is out?
Good choice of using dnd for inspiration of this song! It's be cool if we got a full song with your dnd group telling another amazing tale!
This is a banger, lol I need a full song.
This is just my current party, but instead of the DM, its just me as a human necromancer trying to stop my team of chaotic good anarchists, and instead of hooded figures, its Waterdeep council members begging us to stop our bullshit and go help stop the actual cult from resurrecting Tiamat.
get fuckin PERCIEVED
I love that the Bard says "child" with the DM at 1:25, just figuring it out at that exact moment.
I play a rougue/bard multiclass. this is very accurate.
Um Actually...
Good damn dnd references, I can't not love it
Tommy boy never misses
Tom has unlocked the flute, I've never been so happy
I F'ing love this.
Tom. Stop. Please. I can only get so erect.
Please, please give an animated version of whatever tf just happened here
Tom Cardy D&D songs was something that I didn't know I needed until now... we need more!
I want to thank the gods for your existence in this world. Even when I’m having a bad streak of days, you manage to make me laugh and feel that things are going to be ok. Love your content man, keep it coming!
I'm gonna have the "Loot That Body" bit stuck in my head for days. Thanks Tom.
XD 'he's just lying there right?' ... 'LOOT THAT BODY!!!' XD
Welp, pissed myself you bard asshole.
Absolutely love 0:42 to 0:47 😂
he's not using a drumstick as a prop he's actually such a powerful bard he can get a flute noise out of one
A new Tom Cardy song—today is a good day.
This is great, I love this :)
This would be me in DND if I had any luck with rolls
Two of my greatest loves combined!
This is legitimately one of the funniest things that I have ever seen.
Me and the Boys about to Perception Check and loot that body. Banger as always!
I've played with so many people who can't properly play a bard.  I should have been playing with Tom Cardy this whole time.
I am currently on a bard run in BG3 and this made me die laughing.
That's the best motherf*cker way to play DND
In before this pops off, love this high-effort garbage thank you
I just finished a D&D session where we hadnt had a combat encounter in about 6 months. And this is pretty much the soundtrack to that session :')  the fact that this dropped about the time we finished is just magical.
You mad bastard, you've done it again! thanks for posting
What would happen if Smokin' Joe Rudeboy was a DND character?
I legit guffawed. This is beautiful.
la suite par pitié
who knew we all needed a musical DnD battle
Didn't think it was possible, but being a huge nerd has made Tom more attractive. Amazing.
“Can we reload?” “It’s a live game.” “I know, but can we reload?”
bro wtf is even this LOL
best part of my day was tabbing out of baldurs gate 3 and seeing this on my homepage. also i love the idea of a whole verse being the vicious mockery
I needed that vibe today
Enjoyed this way more than I thought I would.
You bring joy….we all thank you for the laughs. This was absolutely hilarious
Ur storytelling in rhyme IN A SMALLL AMOUNT OF TIME is such a big talent 2 me at least
OFC Tom is a bard. I would fist fight traffic for even half a chance to be a part of a campaign  with this man 😭
Tom Cardy giving us our regular dosage of child murder
I LOVE YOU MR.CARDY
And a D&D player 💗💜💙
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU JUST CASUALLY UPLOAD ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING SONGS IVE EVER HEARD
tom totally would play dnd
When the party decides to loot the child's dead body...  I don't say it yet.
Nice.
If this doesnt get a full version, I'll be sad
If a player told me anything even close to that when I demand an insult for Vicious Mockery, I think breaking their mind instantly from the sheer psychic trauma is fair
the physical pain when he said 'Dont'. I felt it existentially.
I know this is about D&D but it's shocking calling out my current fallout 4 campaign.
This is treasure.😂
I'm just going to go ahead and be that guy who points out that Vicious Mockery uses a Saving Throw, so if a nat20 was rolled immediately after declaring it, it means the child saved against it and took no damage.
Murderhobo bards just got a new theme song :D
We all know you're Chaotic, but I can never really tell if you're Good or Evil
As a DM, the least realistic part of this was making it through 15 days in-game in only 5 sessions
Algorithm
A Tom Cardy D&D song. Life is good.
Ah yes I love D&D  Ditties & Derisions
The funniest part is that Tom's character almost certainly has like  +8 to perception and does not need to roll any of these nat 20s
I could listen to hours of tom singing the happenings of a D&D game
That was wholesome dnd comedy as far as I'm concerned 😂
incredible
it is just.. amazing...just amazing ..
Of course you'd play the bard
TC is a confirmed murder hobo
A friend sent it to me and I instantly knew what you've been playing hahahahahaha. Hope you have as much fun with the game as I have, with just as many different playthroughs with mates and solo runs :) Enjoy!
Uh HUH
I think I might love you Tom.
"that is the child you've been looking for the past 5 actual days of our lives"   this line, is too relatable to comprehend
Oh I should learn English hard. I want to understand this lyrics. What's mean? But the song is good.
I feel like this is the  pendulum, swinging the other way after the Pluto song 😂
He's obviously a Bardbarian, it's impossible to be this brutal otherwise
It was a child Tom! A child!
Nothing fills my inner nerd with more rage than Tom saying he rolled a Nat20 on a Viscous Mockery
someone's been playing bg3
TC been crunching some bones as a bardbarian in BG3 it seems!
This is literally how I play my bard in bg3
... Tom.
Fuckin amazing
I can always count on a relevant bop from you!
In fairness, you don't dress Young Master Missing McSaveme in a dark hooded robe looming out of a forest path unless your primary plan is to get the kid killed and guilt the players with it.  "5 days of our actual lives," don't even play that shit with me motherfucker, you spent those five days giggling while you wrote the scene description of the mother's tearstained face. You're a grief pervert and I knew that when I agreed to join this game. We ALL did. You think we rolled up with a barbarian, a rogue, and a bard because we were expecting some well balanced combat? But you don't get to play coy about it too.
Average bard
...vicious mockery is a saving throw on the part of the target...
I am in love with everything you represent Mister Cardy, don't ever change.
A full Ballad of Bardy Cardy better be coming out soon!!
I am Alpharius.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Dnd bard are GOOOOO
" 1:04 " dang it! I can't breathe 😂💀
Only this guy could make a song about looting a dead child 😂
My favorite part of this is the jethro-tull-esque flute breaks
Ngl, I thought he roasted so hard that the body was eviscerated into non-existence
OH man, that is actually hilarious! Well done. I wonder how long this took you to put together?
Full on murder hobo
I started playing dnd litterally a few days ago and this actually seems like its gonna be an eventuality in my campaign lol
I'm all about D&D with just this song now
It must be nice having friends to play D&D with lol
It's always a bard
I love it. Best thing is, I never personally played DnD and this song is not only making me want to, but also tempting me to play as a bard creating social havoc just for the fun of it
Quest failed but hey we groovin'
Pretty much just a summary of all of Vox Machina campaign.
D&D! Yeahhhhhhyyy
Always a good day for some fire from Tom Cardy.
I think this is my sign to start playing DnD
DND. Screams
i’d absolutely bring my flute to dnd sessions if i was the bard instead of the cleric
Yup. This person legitimately plays D&D!
You're the best lol
The “loot that body” bit hits especially hard for me as a DM, I have a player who upon entering any new room or killing any enemy immediately tries to loot the room/corpse. They consistently roll low, so It always ends up being “you get four copper pieces and a twine of string” or something along those lines.
Tom Bardy
Weighted die
Everytime you release a song it's just a banger. Stop making me dance!
Should you ever do a continuation of this song i want to know if the dead kids body just has a bunch of candy
Bobby Pancakes and Philge really fucked it on their perception rolls huh?
TC releasing yet another song I can’t quite share with my parents lol
Never ever be on the opposite team, #TeamTom
Banger, after banger, after banger. Tom, if you keep being so clever, hilarious and hard working, I'm going to cry
Tight Crew o        a m       r           d           y
This is probably the most influential single source you could send someone to join a DnD campaign
And this, my friends, is why you have somebody in the party with Revivify at all times
The bardic inspiration hits and i am refreshedddd
This song and vid seems like a bard doubling down in spite of some very unhappy party member.
Чувак, я обожаю тебя. Жалко, что в Россию нету возможности заказать твой мерч. Ты супер классный чувак!
You don't roll for Vicous Mockery, they have to make a save
Ok, but here me out... What if there were more bards
The world needs a Tom Cardy and Brian David Gilbert duet.
I was already trying to add this to my playlist
❤
I always smile when he uploads.
with a nat 20 wouldn't bard Tom also perceive if one of the hooded figures is a cop?
I mean, you can always multiclass Astarion as a bard...
I absolutely love that some channels I’m subscribed to (that aren’t centered on D&D) suddenly start posting stuff about D&D after I just purchased 24 dice sets a few days ago
Tom... You're simply the best 🧡 You just made my day, and probably a week too! I'm listening it on repeat for now 🕺
Spotify wheeen, so good hahah. Keep em coming Tom!
Looting the rotting corpse of what once was a small, youthful being with a promising future ahead of them is my favorite pastime
This is great.
This is going in the dnd group chat. absolute gold.
I love your music so much
Did you check... his... butthole?
As a dnd player this is just what being a bard is they are chaotic neutral all fucking day
Me hoping I roll a nat 20 on this comment check to see if Tom says hi
been playing baldurs gate 3?
This is amazing.
Maybe that kid shouldn't have been so short huh? Have you thought of that, Mr DM?
When you play a Bard and you get to the gates of the Druid Grove.
This makes me wish there were more outcomes of the perception checks basically a longer song would be amazing
he can just find a topic a make a great song about it!
Top 1 dnd battles of a lifetime ⚔️
I felt that final bitch
Just had my first DnD session last night and our bard brought a little guiter and used vicious mockery to tell a guy regardless of how dark it is, we could see how ugly he was. I love the interacting of life things I enjoy that I never expected to meet haha definitely gonna play this at the next session!
at least it wasn't eldritch blast
This is... just unnecessarily funny.... and way way way too catchy
I roll to revive. *nat 1* ah fuck lads the kids a lich now
With him being a bard, I expected a very very very different result from the body of the child just lying there
Hey, its their fault for allowing him to play chaotic neutral
I don't want, I NEED an animated clip with that masterpiece.
Loot that body
Bardyest bard around
A spider climbed up my face tonight. I needed this.
can't wait to see an animation adaptacion of this
Was not expecting the "b!tch" at the end, but this dude is very unpredictable
Using a drumstick as a flute, he’s just that good
Vicious Mockery isn't an attack so that natural 20 actually did nothing
I’m laughing so hard because it’s so funny to picture some poor random kid just fucking dying on the spot from Tom’s merciless height roast.
This. This ia absolutely the bard that i have in one of my campaigns.  I'm sending him this. Thanks for making this legendary tune.
This is why my friends don't play dnd with me. This is the kind of shit I do
As a perma-GM, I sympathise a lot with that "don't".
Tom is the embodiment of genius, I'm glad I was born at this time when I can watch his work, despite the fact that I live in Russia❤️‍🔥
Bet he was playing BG3 and this whole song is made out of his pure pain and agony against the mfs that were playing with him. I love how obvious it is.
Shenanigans! A nat 20 in 3.5 would have meant he 100% knew that was the child they were looking for.
Of course he’s a bard why didn’t I see this
Yes I've watched it five times now and I'm here just giggling like a child, what of it? BITCH!
I'm really enjoying seeing bits from the previous songs gradually accrue in the background - the blue pluto jumpsuit and the cheese knees whiteboard are like fun little easter eggs!
He don't miss
Is it bad that I like that song but have no clue what the F he is talking about?
D&D truly lets you live out all of your wildedt fanstasies, such as bullying a child to death and looting his corpse.
normally tom cardys songs are really out there and unrealistic... but this is just a typical dnd session, maybe a little calmer than usual
Fucking love this!
I have a nagging feeling this was part of one of his D&D campaigns
Your songs give me years of life.
This is going straight to my favourites. Oh my god.
oh it took me WAY too long to realise that "flute" is actually a drumstick lmao
Fuck this was so funny i have actual tears, and a bop too
I wish I had more singing bards in my DnD party.
I love Tom Cardy so much ttt-ttt gotta play some RPG     *the flute spin-*
The entire internet is baldur's gate pilled and it's the best thing to have happened in years
This is the Baldurs Gate 3 DLC we need
15 days gametime and 5 days of our actual lives. More like 5 years.
I think because of this video I’m going to create a new bard character for my campaign named Tom Bardy.
My bard character has both accidentally impersonated a dead child and killed a different child by wasting time pretending to be a representative of a plumbers union. I never expected to commit so many child death crimes but I guess it comes with the bard territory
😈😈😈😈
I can't believe I never thought about him being such a great bard. Would absolutely devestate
It's official I love this man
And so we continue the trend of Tom making songs about things that happen to him in real life. Today's edition: his last D&D session
this is so good omg, hoping for a smoking joe treatment and get the full song! otherwise great job
Loot that body baby!
This is one of your absolute best
LETS GOOOOOOOO ❤
I love your music.  I love your energy.  I love everything I've seen and heard from you so far. But I have a problem, Tom. Every single time I hear your music, I have an animation playing in my head that fits the song.  But I don't have the artistic skill to turn those animations in my head into actual animations. And this gives me an overwhelming sense that I have failed. So hearing your music is very much a blessing and a curse.
Going ham on the fantasy flute while he loots a pretend dead kid's body, is peak Tom Cardy.
Tom Cardy being a bard in D&D is a little on the nose but absolutely PREFECT.
I've never played DnD, and randomly decided to play bard in BG3, aaand how, why is it so accurate?!😂is there a type of people who choose to play bard and am I one of them?😅
Usually I wouldnt question anything in a TC video but I do love how the flute is just a spare drumstick. Percussion + Woodwind = Yes
Now we know why Tom never misses when he drops a new song. He always rolls a nat 20
This is very relevant.
i love that the whiteboard still says "cheese knees" from the Level Clear! music video
hahahahahahahaahha
Remarkable, now how do we go about getting a 5 minute version of this? Im willing to roll for it.
The bard is truly the greatest asset to a party. Nothing more powerful than the cunning tongue of an absolute madman.
354th commenter baby yeahhh
Dndeeeee
"it's always a kid" implies that this is far from the first time this has happened.
This is me in DND all the time
The video description saved me from asking the question that immediately came to mind seeing this
You know is a good day when tom cardy uploads
why is this so fucking relatable??
This is how i imagine my bard will mock in baldur’s gate when i character build
The absolute power behind that music drop on “LOOT THAT BODY” almost made me drop my phone. I couldn’t handle it Tom, it’s too fucking good.
He rolled nat20 on Perception yet failed to notice it's who they were looking for, sounds like my party
The D&D vibes this has is amazing
Will you just fucking marry me ALREADY!?!?!
The flute spinning was critical!
Father has made us content!
Go bulls*hit go
I KNEW I LOVED YOU  Tom's a D&D nerd I fucking love this
i need a full version of that song, omg
To be fair, the kid was also dressed in a dark cloak, so how could he have know better?
Did you know I’m part of an actual D&D funny podcast "dragon friends"? It’s on streaming or wherever, I played music for a bunch of season and in the last few started playing characters. Check it out it’s very funny, especially the first bunch of seasons before I was there!
you never disappoint mr dad
Well that's the kid's fault for being cloaked. Your sick cloak, now.
Classic bards 😂
Getting two songs in a month it’s a gift from god
You. Are. Perfection.
Time to listen to this banger 18 times in a row
my biggest flex is that i was early to one of these legendary videos
I just started watching Dimension 20 this week so it really feels like the planets aligned for my favorite songwriter to put out this DnD song. ❤
0:46
god this is so fucking good, love tom and his silly music
as a flautist i'm gonna have to politely request more Flute Cardy and the Mystical Drumstick
Anyone else want an hour long video of Tom doing this
I would so watch a whole stream or listen to a podcast with Cardy boy playing DND
Didnt know you played! Also this it the new DnD opening song for my group.
Love you Tom
Yeah BG3 is a good game
Ok i didn't expect that end because he was a bard...  Bard love a lots of things...  They love every creatures...  Very very much...  Too much...  Even a slime...  A dragon...  A dog...  so...
Either it’s a specific story song or a bop, and it’s mostly a bit of both  Love it all the time lol
he will not stop crit succeeding his performance checks
This is so awesome
This and Level Clear have this crazy "How do you do fellow kids" energy which is so weird to me because I have no doubt that he actually likes and participates in these things
Playing a male bard rn in BG3 and this is scarily accurate.
I just realised the DM never says they actually wanna harm them. The bard simply said it and everyone took it as fact, meaning this never had to happen in the first place
You are not well.
Its the little feet taps when you play the flute that really sells it
I love the idea that every time Tom rolls a twenty he breaks into a actual song like this and the rest of the crew is annoyed from it.
Tom I love you
what a masterpiece
Sending this to my party, they need to know😁
GENIUS! You are a damn genius!
As someone who’s D&D crazy and a Bard lover, I’ve never been more attracted to Tom than I am right now after listening to this
I'm really, really excited for your next album 😩
Cant wait for it to develop an even crazier story of looting dead kids of some fellas that mean us harm.
thanks bro. I'm not in my best days lately. This made me laugh really hard. I needed that. Thank you.
The amount of emotion that went into 'because it was a CHILD' got me rolling
This song is now stuck in my head for 8 lifetimes and I couldn't be happier
Then That One Guy™ pipes up and says "actually Vicious Mockery is a wisdom saving throw"
This is incredible
i dont know if i want you or i wanna be you
Tom, I beg you to do a cover of Inner City Pressure if you haven’t already.
You’re not just a bard. You obviously made a deal with an infernal patron to be capable of producing a bardic inspiration video so powerful as this.
I loot the body! What do I get?
it is a REQUIREMENT that when a Bard uses Vicious Mockery you have to sling an insult. If it's good, you can add an extra point of damage "for the burn."
TOM NOOOOOOOOO
I'm ready for this to be a whole series!
Based on that last verse I believe this might have been co-written by Michael Hing…
Im planning to be a bard in my dnd campaign, so thank you Tom for the inspiration
Real
Welp, what I hoped smoking Joe would become when it was the initial short, I now hope will be the case for this Tight Crew and its adventures 😂
the way he sings "my boys are otherwise engaged" singlehandedly absolutely shattered my mind. nobody move. this is a masterpiece
this is a piece of art
least insane bard player
Magnificent as always
Accurate to a normal DnD campaign
Ehehhehehhehehehehe
YESS MORE DnD/Baldurs  Gate 3 content PLEASE!!! Critical SUCCESS
Baldur's Gate 3 yaaaaas
That's why bards rule!
I’m so happy, I never thought we’d ever get a Tom Bardy video
The frustration on that "don't," I felt it deep in my DM soul.
Need to see you in Dimension 20
Finally an excuse to get my friends who like D&D to watch a Tom Cardy video.
Can we start to call you... TOM BARDY?
I Love you. I Love you Tom.
Took us on a journey for sure.
I am fucking CRYING, incredible isn't enough to describe this
I knew because those dice are cropped from Baldur's Gate 3 and I've been playing it obsessively for about a month.
The bard rolls 20 yet again
My party couldn't meet this week due to a player being sick, but I bet this cheers the group up, message sent.  Thanks for rolling a nat 20 on your skill check Tom.
I would to watch a real DnD session with Tom
This is me and my friends in any campaign
I just love the flute
Awesome. Total immersion.
I just ran a Smokin' Joe oneshot - the party walks into the town of Longhorn being hired to take out the Mongoose Mountain Gang lead by the Velvet Man. Fought a rattlesnake hydra, cactus mimic, took down the gang, then had a showdown with Rudeboy after accidentally killing his daughter where he used his gift of vishnu to cast vicous mockery on all of them simultaneously. 10/10 would recommend
Vicious Mockery is a Wisdom save, you can't roll a crit when casting it
I sent this to my d&d group to out our bard as this is literally his anthem for playstyle
You know, I always thought Tom would be a good D&D player, but murder hobo bard? Yeah, that scans.
So the kid is just *slightly* shorter than the rest of the bandits?
Years ago I had my first rpg campain with friend (not quite dnd, we were too stupid to fully use the real rules, but it was close enough) I had one of my friends play a Tiefling bard and that is EXACTLY them
I'm willing to bet this is something that he's seen at his own DnD group.
God DAAAAAMN 😂
Oh God 😂 I'm dying. Brilliant
I always love a roast integrated into the lyrics of a funky song.
"I can perceive you" is such a beautifully threatening line
The millisecond after I read the title I said "Huh looks like Tom's been playing baldur's gate"
Someone’s been playing Baldur’s Gate.
Exactly what always happens when you play dnd
I love DnD I love Tom Cardys amazing work  I have achieved true happiness just now
jesus that was savage
Yesss give us TC as co-writer & actor in a fantasy series as a chaotic Bard <3
Best way to wrap up the day! 😂😂
This man lives in my head rent free and that is OH fucking KAY
"Made middle aged woman cry today" "Killed child with depression" What next, Tom?
new song to listen to for the next month
indeed
Just save and reload duh
Tom just getting back from playing dnd and wrote this song
Why is always the most psychopathic player the one who gets the nat 20s? Is that a universal rule?
It's that bard life of crime we love so much.
"Loot that body!" will play in my head any time something like this happens now lol
I'm living for all these bards videos
You truely are the greatest Bard of our time 😂
1:22 DM tom has said this enough times that human bard tom recognizes what's coming before the sentence is over and they both sing CHILD in sync
He saw that so hard
🥸
7,940 views
HOLY SHIT
You've released this on our dnd night we love you
Unironically best song yet. Laugh every second
And apparently getting ahead of yourself all the time.
Is there ANY topic Tom cannot write a banger song about? I mean.  Anything at all?!?
hahaha
I... usually listen to your tunes while zooted to the moon, but I'm stone sober and cackled so hard my sister came to check on me
Always that one chaotic ah player who has fun and gets the most fucked results 😭 W SONG, T
Found the bard!
😂😂😂😂😂 OMFG IM CRYING HAHAHAJ
0:22 is such an amazing flute riff it deserves its own comment, so here it is.
Tom Cardy the bard AKA Tom Bardy
the most accurate part is the DM's long delay to say "yes" before immediately squeezing his eyes shut in pure disappointment 🤣
Tom still proving he's not a cop by rolling a bard.
As if he couldn’t get hotter… he plays BG3
What do you think about red flags going viral
thank you for the anthem of exactly what my group have to put up with (I sing my vicious mockery for sheer annoyance reasons)
o 0:16
I would have been playing D&D today but I'm on the bus home because our rogue is at work. This song makes it all better! Especially since our DM is railroading us.
interesting
Holy shit my favorite Youtube musician and my favorite pastime have become one! A nat 20 indeed good sir!
Tom and D&D was a combo I didn't know I needed
Nobody gonna talk about that sick flute twirl Tom did???!!??!?
As soon as he asked about the body, I knew where it was going...
My body when i listen to this :  (ノ°ο°)ノ  ヽ(°◇° )ノ   (σ‾▿‾)-σ
I laughed uncontrollably hard when his immediate response to a npc being short was “I cast vicious mockery”
The dangers of having a player that is actually capable of roleplaying a bard.
This song is prime material for an animation.
Didn’t think I’d hear a song about a bard soloing an entire enemy encounter by mocking their height, but here we are. Amazing, Tom, as always
“Gotta loot that motha7ka”
The idea of the bard player actually playing their instrument during the game is so fantastic. That's another song for the playlist :D
D&D Tom Cardy songs? A niche I didn't know that I craved content for.  Loved the Bard rizz btw.
I'm just gonna go ahead and share that to my DnD group chat 🤣🤣🤣
What does "cheese knees" mean? 🤔
This isn't accurate hes playing bard and flirted with none of his teammates or npcs
This is great and hilarious 😂
Petition for Tom to stream a playthrough of baldur's gate 3 (playing as a bard of course)
Tom Cardy and DnD, my 2 favorite things :D
I'm old and this entire thing went over my head. I'm sure it's hilarious though.
CHAOTIC ABSOLUTE
ah yes bards  love it!
OF COURSE tom would be a bard. love it.
In game right?
thinking of tom as a chaotic bard is actually perfect
I think that guy's a cop
The look of horror on the DM when he realizes what's coming with the Don't. Felt that.
Out off all of the spells he could have used he used one that you don’t have to roll for lol
I get the distinct impression that Tom is either the best or worst to be at the table with. And I'm leaning worst, cause screw that guy who rolls 20s in a roll.
Hilarious 😂
XD
YEAH!
Sounds like a good opportunity to make a villain.
This is so funny! your videos are always funny. Keep up the good work
Is there somewhere I can listen to Braveheart Banknote's song from Dragon Friends 6.18 Heebied his Jeebes without downloading the whole episode every time?
TOM YOU NERD i love you
immaculate
Nat 20 on your Performance check
There’s already so many comments! I gotta be faster on the click
Let's face it.  Vicious Mockery would be banned in every civilized location.  The idea you could just have some idiot whisper "yeah, but your mom"and you straight up die would tear the world apart as we know it.
yeah my bard ass identifies with this 😅
w h a t
OK I held my breath for a second when I heard bard because it always ends in 2 ways... and both ends with someone in tears it just depends if its the insulted target or the party having to witness the bard bang another BBG
I don't play DnD (I read old rule books and monster manual's cause I'm a weirdo) so I only recently found out about vicious mockery, but it's my favorite thing ever.
Now imagine a whole group comprised of TC like bards! THE UNSTOPPABLE POWER OF MUSIC
Babe wake up, Tom just dropped a DND song!
Glad to see everyone else is also neck deep in baldurs gate
WAKE UP NEW TOM CARDY SONG DROPPED-
murderhobo behavior (affectionately)
The fact that he specifies 15 days in game and 5 irl days makes me assume they've been playing daily with 3 in game days per game just searching for this child. It's unbelievably funnier once I picture them FINALLY finding the kid and whoopsie he's dead
A Tom Cardy D&D song???? FUCK YES
Tom’s face at the start is the culmination of all his friend’s Nat 1’s
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Tom if this doesn’t make it on the next album the emu war is gonna look like a joke.
Man I love it when this guy posts whenever I’m depressed
Either Tom's the luckiest bard in the realm or that thing is weighted 😅
Just received my grandmothers ashes and death certificate. Thank you for bringing some joy and laughter at the most inappropriate but best time possible.
YEAH Tom please stream your self playing BG3- it would be a dream come true XD
Tom, you are a bloody king !
Sure, the rouge rolled a 1, but they'll beat them all in a MIND FIGHT!
These are so random that I wouldn't be suprised if the next song was about industrial revolution.
I cannot stress how much i love the recording room in the background with the "slanted" soundproofing.
Killed it!    Literally
Fuckin LOVE this guy😂
Вообще не знаю перевод но звучит круто
DND SONG LETS FUCKING GO its exasperated DM jokes but with music what more could you ask for
Tom playing dnd and being a bard is so perfect  Im sending this to my party
If I’m not looting bodies is it even an RPG?
Yesssssss
The amount of storytelling this guy can do in 99 seconds is something else EDIT: I can't count
Amazing, that could be my characters, all of them lmao
It just feels too right that Tom is both playing dnd, and is a chaotic bard.
I tried to stop watching this video... nat-1
LMFAO PERFECT
This is where universes collided
Sending this to my D&D group that includes my dad, sister, brother-in-law, and two family friends, will come back with their reactions ASAP
Gotta love the one person in the party that gets stupid lucky for no reason
I see even tom cardy is playing bg3
Divine
The one person brave enough to point out vicious mockery prompts a saving throw and doesn't use an attack roll.
Well, now I want to play a Bard. Thanks for that.
The fact that Tom is over her doing some RP made me backflip out of my chair.    Luckily I rolled a 17 on my acrobatics check so I didn't eat the floor.  I'm all good.
I love this
Ummm akchtually Vicious Mockery is a saving throw not an attack roll. 🤓
Finally a murder hobo anthem, thanks tom
I hate that this is exactly how I choose to play. The chaotic neutral yet savage person in the party
YESSS I HAD NO IDEA TOM LIKED BG3/DND
TOM CAPRY
babe wake up tom cardy just uploaded
TOM CARTY
I love it!!! ❤
Was about to comment about BG3 but the description has bested me. 1-0 to you, Tom.
🦖
Why do these always appear when I'm about to go to bed. Goodbye sleep for the next two hours as I have this on loop!!!!
Perfect
Tom Cardy rolled a 20 on this
Sending this to my DM with an apology 😅
The bard:
the fact i briefly closed Baldur's Gate 3, opened YouTube and this was staring me in the face with "posted 1 minute ago"....
10/10
Tom when is the red flags song, but I have an idea what if the red flags was the waiter singing it and Tom was the waiter
Tom can play flute? Is there any instrument he can't play?
I thought this man could not get any better, tis I am wrong. Cause this man plays DnD Tom deserves this: 👑
I am the very essence of confusion
I passed mine
Its is so good your music is the best
Shit
Sent to my dnd group immediately lmaoo
this is better than my dad saying he was proud of me
YEEAAHH NEW SHORT SONG BABYYY!
This is a banger
Tom you pin me plis?
That was really good ❤Another funny song added to my playlist 🤣
i hate rhe fact i understand this all
Oh a perfect song for me DND weekend!
This guy unironically has amazing music production quality
I totally accept TC being a DnD bard in real life
But the question now, Tom is, how far into Baldur's Gate 3 are you?
Amazing keep on the good talent!
Hi
