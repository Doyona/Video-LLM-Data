So funny how he says "don't tarnish favourable name please', so sincere 5:47

3:20 My friend is really invested emotionally in this review
Favourite chicken rainham village need to go there
yoo thats near me
I'm not gonna lie, I'm... Not not gonna eat this 😂😂  Yasssss
Best part about this is how many mandem now check the potato content of their chips
Beat in the background
Since you're wearing AUS Nikes......in Australia we have "chicken salt"....and that stuff makes chips crack.
NAH BRO WAS TO SCARED TO GIVE A BAD RATING ECAUSE OF HIM
Man sd down under as if S Ldn is another continent 🤣

Cause I live in Notts the other day I went in town and went to a chicken shop myself and this white guy just ate the skin and the smallest bit of chicken off of a wing 😭😭
Big up Jessie, remember him from newcross monson days 😂
Has to do the new Popeye's I'm Westfield next.
My guy looks to the stars everytime he bites
Do BFC in Colliers Wood
Big up for repping Tolworth
Big Jess representing the South, should’ve taken him to Morley’s in Brockley or Deptford. Defo would’ve slapped differently.
"for some people... datts a phalange" I died lmao You need to do a KFC or big chain so we know what the standard is! We've all been to KFC so we can relate.
We would be besties, I called that 3.8 from a mile(kilometers?) Away.
MAN SAID “Incy Wincy’s cousin” 🤣🤣🤣

All these years and the music is still overbearing. Staying true ;)

This accent is 🤣 similar to that of the Nany on South Park with Eric Cartman 🤣🤣
chip rating seemed wayyy too high from what u said
eensie weensie's cousin lmaoooooo
Marylands in Leicester city center was always good
I hate that American fried chicken is not as good as London cheap chicken. Have to watch this show just to remember.
Mans starting to look a lil thicc after all these years of service
Try favorite chicken & ribs in catford it don’t disappoint
Oh shit I thought this channel was dead, glad to see you're making a comeback with the older format again  <3
Havent seen one of your videos in like 2 years, mans been eating good I see😂
Anyone know the beat in the background? It's banging ngl
THE PENGIEST MUNCH OMG ITS THE PENGIEST OF THE PENG MUNCH BRUV
Nah, y’all gotta recap the kicks because both pairs were super hard 💪🏾
I reckon CNSR would be good at stand-up comedy, he’d succeed well in that, I can picture him on stage.
He needs to go to jangos
I cant believe my man 20 somthing
Try Morley’s in Clock House! Wings are 👌🏻
For me pengest munch Is mumsies food.
Hope you do cardio b
That background music gets very annoying
He went to one of the deadest chicken shops in lewisham 🤦🏾‍♂️

Banging wings & I’m from Hackney
The Pengest Chunk
i love this dude
*scratches head* maybe you sat in a spiders home which was the bench and they are crawling on you trying to tell you that you’re in our home.
Bro, you need to review Popeye in Stratford.😄😄😄😄
You were on a roll years ago and then you sold yourself to Channel 4 and died. It's dead. Stop trying to bring it back.
Yo the dress code aint it fam...👀
Mad to think dis guy is 28
man will forever look like hes 15.
this is one of my locals so I was hoping for the good ratings like my man was opposite CNSR lool
"i cant lie, i cant NOT eat this" loooool F that spider
This is the most british thing I've ever seen.
man be 40 running round like hes 13
you stomedy's cousin?
Bruh turn the bludclart background music down
Get to the new Popeyes!
Very obviously influenced by the local lad, easily a 0.8 overscore due to intimidation
What the fuck?! I thought this gentleman stopped making videos. Glad to see he's been back. Subbed!
What gloves are they
5:32 You're literally eating outside, on a dusty ass bench. Tf you'd expect Mr. Chicken Connoisseur? It definitely wasn't in your meal, don't be a dusty daft yute.
"for some people that's a phalange"
He speaks like he's 200 words short on his essay, love it
Oh, and don’t chew on the ankles of a chicken bud, that’s an act of desperation..
The trouble with eating garbage.. you become accustomed to it..
not in front of my fav hairdresser 😩😂 , atleast now Ill know if that chicken shop is nice or not
mans looking 40
Lmao bro genuinely looks like someone's aunt now
Turn the shit music down lad
mandem so hungry a second pair of lips grew under his chin
swear down, all chicken places just taste the same man. Even KFC has almost fallen to their levels in the taste department in certain places.  Go outside of the UK and get KFC, you will taste the original recipe taste.
< 3 3 3
You got me with the chicken.. if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Original peng, all the way. Glad to see you're back.
is this youtuber a girl or a guy. I can't even tell...
30k!! it will smash it in 2022
looked like a good meal. £6 bargain. i had KFC saturday. fillet burger 2x legs 2x wings, beans beans with pepsi max was over a tenner and sometimes its hit or miss if the chicken is gonna be nice.
“For some people that’s a phalange” 😂
Far too generous with the scoring
What's up with this obsession with shoes in ghettos I don't get it.
where’s VP on the camera
My guy went from 1 neck to triple neck in a span of 3 years

Don't no how people can eat it to the bone properdirty some ofthe bits
My local shop 😂😂😂
This guy literally gets fatter with each episode!!
I felt that connoisseur was slightly pressured in his judgement. It's really hard to judge food properly, when your friend shows you the place. But from the footage, it is looking pretty good. :)
The fact that mans almost 30 and looks like hes in year 8
More chicken, less other stuff. Certi.
Is this man still in y9

"Completely unbiased football analysis if that's your thing. And if that's not your thing, we also do completely agenda driven biased analysis as well" 🤣 sounds like something David Brent would say
Potato content, a chip is 100% potato 😂😂😂😂

Man has not aged 1 single day since he started doing these vids.. what age is he?
Do this more my g
My man looks like a forever freshie. Straight up looks like a visa don from Africa. Like a weird afro nephew forever baby. Why doesn't he age?
East London is definitely the birthplace of chicken and chips. However, South did start knife crime.
Why does he look the same age ?? I’m convinced he’s 16
Big up lee
Giggs is the cameraman
This is like 5 mins away from my school
When mans started patting down his forehead ☠️☠️☠️

Favourable... I call it perfectly serviceable when the food ain't Banging
How are you asking for a crep check when your ankles are begging for moisture and hydration?! @2:16?
Cameraman’s laugh is as recognisable as Seth Rogen I’d say
Stick to this instead of commenting wass on music videos
Pam Pam chicken in forest gate
I love how emotional the guests get about their locals 😂
Looking more and more like yolande every day
really pleased that the focus is so tight on the house behind them...
Bro, much respect for making a living eating fried chicken. Much respect.
its like when you show your friend a video and they dont like it 😂
Man got the leg and not the sidepiece 🤦‍♂️
Anti ageing cream? Plastic surgery? Nah fam, this man's DNA. Boy hasn't aged a day since he turned 17.
This guy doesn’t age
bro people for some reason really like watching you eat and review food, me as well, but I think you should consider expanding your review series to different types of foods, just name it something different and upload em here, maybe like kebab reviews or beef burger reviews, or fish and chip shop reviews
This channel needs some better editing like the good old days and please for the love of god continue doing chicken reviews my brother 🙏
You should visit Baraka Piri Piri in Edgware Road, the only place worth going to in the whole area. Then maybe go to a shisha cafe after lol.
This place is called “favourite” chicken in my bits
5:13 Pause
more munch de peng
How old is this guy now lool
My man is a glitch in the system, looked 14 for 6 years now
Man like Dennis, a voice you can’t mistake 🐐
My man got double chins on his neck😂😂😂

2:23  😂 I love how when we speak to fellow/or non fellow countrymen we (respectfully) adopt that tone and tempo of speaking. Loved seeing the chicken shop reviews, banter and jokes with little Incey’s cousin. 🔝 1️⃣ 🙌🏼
Go khf

Man said vintage 2016 air max 🤣🤣🤣
Should try to uplift the game instead of doing bakeries what not, do some upscale fried chicken tings in London, there's hundreds. Butchies should be the first, you'll be well pleased.
He should make his own shop
He’s so old now
I live near Lee, thanks
Thoughts on chicken shop gravy?
KFC: *Kung Fu Chicken*   ..Fight me for dat leg boiz...

Whatdoes pengest munch mean?
gassed to see another pengest munch episode
6:44 "is that good? 🥺" Hahahahahahahha
LOOL i was thinking how comes you're on ends, then I see who you're with 😂
What's the loop in the background of the crep check?
CNSR, I do like you, so please take this as the conscructive criticism it is meant to be: Bro, you still don't get what people like about your videos, really. Adding more strangers to your videos won't make them any better, if seen so many of your videos, adding your friends or whoever NEVER works (Money Up didnt work, ask yourself:why), bc they stop the flow of the videos and vid double in length without additional content. Like in this case: You expect me to watch a 11:44 min video which I practically already know bc ive seen your other videos before. Its so unrealistic, know your place.  You need to focus on 5-7 min vid, flow with music. No pauses, many cuts. Don't explain your rating system...you think anyone watches bc of "how" you rate chicken? Focus on shoes, clothing, and focus on YOU, make some jokes. Bro, there is so much potential, for example, instead of interacting with your friends, you try to interact with the chicken shop owners (or interview other customers - I know, its difficult right now), just a funny one liner would add so much, show more of the shops. Bro, watch your very first video, it feels like a music video, ep. 53 feels dead. And for gods sake please keep your friends out of the videos and focus on the things that work for you instead of the things that dont.
Jess who? Wait, no one cares....
Go Edmonton dixy next
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BOOMBOW
Class episode 😂
This review was favourable.
Get chunks on the channel
This aint the same
Absorption, I'll say it again, absorption!
Brudda in the north face stressing like the chicken shop is his dads joint about to face eviction

Appreciating the creps from down under
Amazing episode the king of all chicken and chips, you should try USA chicken in leytonstone east london the last time i went there they had an amazing rating overall u wont regret it as im from north london coming to east lol
Oh my. It’s back. The greatest week of my life just got better

I wanna see some workout videos bro!      !!!!!!
I'm down for either or of the videos.
Nah £6 for Chicken burger meal with some wings should be around 4.50-5 max , especially in south
These are my favourite vids, go back to the chicken shops and u can go around the country to level it up
Who is Lee bruv?
7:28 'For some people, that's a phalange' LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, my man brought out the encyclopedic words

“I’m not gonna not eat this” - class.
he still looks fresh out of year 9
Armchair gaffers stand up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
FWIW, I like the reviews of other places than chicken shops.  If you get a chance to come out to zone 5 North West London, try Royal in Eastcote. Get the Met or Picadilly line out to Eastcote and it's like 3 mins away.  Bossman there's smile will probably win you over.
Did the other guy say his shoes were vintage.... And then say they were 2016.....?
creps colddddd
"Incy wincy's cousin" I'm using that hahaha
Mans be elevating numbers due to stress, his heart be true. Parental guidance 5/5.

BIG UP ACG!!
How do we get this guy a trip to Kentucky, USA for chicken? Go global man, reviewing chicken in Dubai, Shanghai, New York, let’s gooooo
I feel like these ratings were influenced by the friend who’s backing Favourable 😂
Spider n chips yummy!!!!
Love this but also love the new content to my man
Anyone else have a headache from the music!? I still watched the entire vid tho 🤕😂
Jess must have shares in favourable.  He seemed waaaay too invested in the scores.
No way is this guy where I used to live couple months ago 😅😘
Ive been saying this for years. CHESTERS SEVEN KINGS!!!! Just by the station.
Glad to see my home town representing how chicken is done
Can't call it Favourites because it's taken. So Bossman opened up a thesaurus.
I miss how the old episodes were edited
His succulency hath returned!
Looks like a fabulous meal! Perhaps they want you to salt your own chips with one of them little salt packets?
Does the boy in the North Face jacket have shares in this chicken shop? He seems to take criticism on the food to heart. Calm down man.
Chicken is back-yeeesss!
Boom bow! Finally back! Praise da lord!
You need to go to PHILLADELPHIA MANCHESTER!! Best chicken in the UK!!
Fucking oath reppin the Australia 🇦🇺   Much love from Sydney Australia don’t worry bout us we around we outside 😂🧨
Feel like he was being nice with the score innit 😭😭
Went back to the roots, respect it 👊🏾
I like this format, having an advocate for the shop right there, sweating as you review.
Finally fam this is what we want!
Go to a shop called oz in dalston
I dont know if the connoisseur would have made it home if rated this one badly. Peer pressure got to him imo ahaa

jess' presence and earnestness was favorable, a 4.6 no doubt
Been missing these "The Pengest Munch" episodes - keep them coming mate, it's the staple of the channel imo.
This show still hasn’t recovered the loss of the first producer
More chicken videos, Its why we're all here. Had to stop watching the channel until this video popped up. The pukka grub vids are okay i suppose but definitely do not attract and hold the viewers attention a as much as your chicken shop vids. Much love !
You willing to travel out of London to do a review?

As a londoner, it would be good to see you do reviews out of London bro. Maybe hit up up north/ Midlands / wales etc. Keep doing your thing though.

Keep an eye on those cholesterol levels, friend. It's not a game with the plague and its mainstream fix. Bloodclot isn't just a Jamaican phrase these days

Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Ole's at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!
going back to his roots.
