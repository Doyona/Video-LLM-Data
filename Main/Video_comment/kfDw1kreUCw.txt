I really clicked on this video thinking it was of yesterday's game because the time of the day and scoreline was so similar😂😂😂
Ramsdale,wow
Emirates is back. The noise is something else
xhaka goal epic
Oh What a game   Arsenal Arsenal Arsenal  With huge moral
Respect Arteta👏👏👏
7:14 I thought the security were going to celebrate.😂😂
We will make it this season by God Grace..🔞
We are the best team Arsenal.💞
God help us come back this good on Man u 🙏🏿
I love Arsenal with my life...
Lord knows how much I love Ramsdale😂😂
Should of been atleast 6
WHO WUN
Sometimes Playing Football is Easier than Managing As a coach ♥️ Look at Mikel He feels every emotions of football in this game
Are you sure you want number 8? Because that's a 20 (Hoshiana) or did you just loose your hands?. Remember when my brother played in three positions in one game? The Lord Is Faithful*.
😷
Arsenal deserves some credit considering this is his first job as a manager and he is in a league where all the top 4 managers have all been managing for several years and have all won champions league
David Benchcam?
Unbelievable good performance heads up as a gunners
6:56〜 アルテタ「こりゃあかんわ…トミどこ！？トミ！？、トミ今すぐ準備して！」でしょ
Kreatif arsenal 🤙
たまにハイライトの最後にアルテタ監督が映ると、ハンサム過ぎてefootballの映像見ていたと勘違いする時ある。格好いいな〜
7:43 Tavares the manager tapping Mikel the player😂
pyramid pirlo back with a masterclass
Arteta very good manger ❤️❤️
Tavares knee slide after scoring got me dieing
U will never realize how underrated and good was as a player and now as a manager ARTETA KING... Barcelona,Rangers,Psg,Everton ,Arsenal ;)
It's Arteta cam, not bench cam.....
Go go go.. Arsenal....!!!  Love you arsenal.
✊✊👍👍👍
I think I learned about this arsenal game all the 3 goals building at the back no more goal kicking hope artetaioula ball
Arteta's energy is super huge
Such a Great game, I absolutely loved Artey's Passion !!! Now with that 2-1 against the Hammers on Sunday lets keep the momentum going Boys. Absolutely Great !!! Given Chelsea slips again a couple more and we can grab 3rd from them, what a season ending that will be. COYG ..... GOONER FOREVER !!!!
Keep Elneny, Buy Ruben Neves, buy Gabriel Jesus, keep Nketia, get Saliba back, keep Nico Pepe and Arsenal can beat any team.
the only thing that is stopping us from playing champions league football next season is TIME
Tommyyyyy!!!!   my idol.
nice embrace between Ronaldo and the gaffer @4.05
Am a happy Kenyan fan
Don't ruin the talent that is Ødegaard like we did with Ozil. Build around him and Saka, a number 9 is top priority then reinforce the back 4 with at least 1 maybe world class centre back.
Great work from arsenal's squad Champions League ahead of us🤞🤞
Give Elneny an extension
These Benchcam vids are gold,but they seem to raise more questions  than they answer. Like what did Arteta instruct to Xhaka after the 1st goal? And what language does a Portugese player use when speaking to the a Spanish manager when playing football in England?
Arteta be fixing the bottom of his sweater every 10 seconds?
Please, all Arsenal fans we are fundraising money for my mother's colon cancer surgery; please, help me with whatever you have. As an Arsenal fan, I appreciate you beyond imagination.
This Club is the bomb🧨 I can’t wait next match！
I don't envy Arteta at all. Repeated 90 minutes of pulsating adrenaline rush with a bandwagon of ungrateful fans.
Welcome to back Tomi
Arteta: 👈👉👆👇↗↙🔄⤴⤵😲😠😀🤯 Rangnick: 👁👄👁
he reminds me so much of Pep
I don't care what anyone says. Elneny is a wonderful player. I watched him at the Cup of Nations and he was just so important for Egypt in that midfield. He works hard and does the simple things well. He looks a much better player in this Arsenal setup and I hope he stays at the club for a very long time.
I love looking for the same people in the crowd to watch their reactions to different events. There's one lad with a blue jacket yellow stipes down its sleeve and for every joyous moment he hugs everyone around him. On the Xhaka Banger he ends up in a group hugs with about 4 other lads!
Like a conductor
Love the gunners &arsenal 🔥🔥🔥🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿
Have a look at how many times Arteta has to pull his jumper down during this video!
NOTE : DECLAN RICE west ham, for MF , he play as well as partey , FOR ARS transfer team
ohhh!!! YEEAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
The one on one Nketiah's miss was a pass from Ødegaard who did a flick and the ball didn't go straight to Nketiah but he followed the ball. Quickly turned and David de Gea was facing him. It could have been a good play(if the pass went straight to Nketiah from  Ødegaard) initiated by Elneny. That play looked almost like the second goal which VAR gave a penalty , though this play was from the right side initiated by Saka.
They were saved during the first leg.2nd leg we were not going to have it again😂.Conference league,Manchester must play and know it's anthem.COYG!!🇰🇪🇰🇪
Arteta laying down the blueprint on how to pick a club up from its knees, ten hag is being advised by scholes to do exactly the same.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Arsenal ❤️💯👍🔥
The fans always get on their feet when Saka is on the ball, I think that underlines his importance
Arteta is a great tactician, no doubt...a lot of the actions and goal possibilities came out of the building from the back. He already proved that he can undo the pressings of Chelsea, MU, MC, Tottenham,..  The players (like ramsdale, gabriel..) are still doing mistakes sometimes, but they are still learning arteta's lessons. Ramsdale for example will learn that in some cases, he can't aim a precise pass, too much risks. He has to take a long ball towards Nketiah's head.  One of the others strenghts of Arsenal now is the offensives transition. They are not in a hurry, they attack intelligently, in certain zones, with specific and precise moves. In fact, i think arteta has already led arsenal squad at the best tactical level since 15 years. The players are knowledgeable tactically. Arsenal is much more pragmatic now. They are aware of the different moments of the game. The previous arsenal squads, since the invincibles, were incapable of doing that.   I feel like he is still building up the engine, one piece after the other, and he lets the team assimilate each step for months. He clearly is in a strong position now : he built a group of young squad, most of them are under 25, and they are trained in Arteta's way for the long term. Really good situation, dream situation for a coach actually.  That second coach seems great too, very advised choice..
Arteta’s passion is just priceless ✨
I love when the players always listening arteta nicely
don't worry guys, as expected they will lose again next game
Ronaldo need touch Arteta to scores. 😅
7:45 Arteta steps on the pitch in his comeback match against United and directs the game from the sideline until he's taken off only seconds after.
1:00 My favorite!
Is there a better sound than Arsenal fans celebrating a goal at a full Emirates?
3.13, Arteta was asking for the pass.
3.13, Arteta was asking for the pass.
Feed me more 🔥
4:05 Ronaldo says : Arteta please replace my coach,he's a comedian 😀
Very lucky at times. It easily could have gone either way in this match, but a win is a win I guess.
สุดยอด
Even the steward in the back celebrates the third goal..love it🔴🔴🔴
rubbish Arsenal！
Even Arteta didn't expect that XhakaBoom!
i love him man, hes like a fan on the touchline, living every single moment of the game. we are so lucky to have him, people need to realise this
his reaction to nunos shot makes me laugh evry time
come ooooooooooooooooooooooooooon
Amazing win 👏👏👏
7:34 see how he motivates tavres. I need you and I will keep trusting u.. go on and learn boy.
When someone miss pass ,  arteta face 😂😂😂
bring on the hammers we the heavy metal steel
That handshake between Ronaldo and Arteta
Bros celebrating a game that was fixed 💀
How is this x5  the length of highlights?
ne kadar güzel lan taraftarlarla olan senkron tepkileri.
Arteta acting like a choir master in the side line
This is so lovely to watch 😃
1:37 elneny was having a bath
He is really passionate bruh
My manager COYG
Xhaka goal really kill the game. Prior to that, we can see Arteta try to make change probably in LB. And Nuno Tavares really need a good scolding.
富安🔥
Such a shame as a united fan they had to lose to a absaloutly  a d category team like arsenal but our time will come as man utd shows every team what they are
I have seen the highlights over and over again, rewatched the game a million times and it just gets better and better🤣
I love how they cut out the part where Mikel was getting the crowd on the ref for VAR Decision
ロナウドがイエローになったのは紛れもなく守備が機能してないからだ 彼は良いプレーをしてる
I'm fan arsenal from malaysia🇲🇾
Best atmosphere
Was so happy Xhaka scored!!!!
That Xhaka - Laca celebration. Love! :)
Elneny only played "bcos of the way he trained this week".So how did he train for the last 8 months?!
Love this F’n team
Very Scientific play from arsenal. Take a good look that nketia offside goal. it was actually a reverse of that second goal against chelsea
@5:43 when u hold the "O" button a little too long 🤣
Please bring Tammy Abraham to Arsenal. We need a tall fast striker. COYG!
Eleney plays better when he gets praised. Much better than Sambi atm. He has played much more than him in Arsenal, the experience says.
Xhaka’s goal is the best moment for arsenal family this year
The Egyptian is world class ❤️
im a spurs fan but im a little jealous. arteta at your club reminds me of pochettino back in 2015. a young, passionate, new manager who gets this feel good factor going. conte is chelsea so we will never have this feeling with him; arteta is not associated with any of ur rivals. and conte is not a long term manager but arteta could be. i like saka my nigerian Bible reading brother. i like to see him do well but don't like arsenal do well. those two big wins for you have swung the momentum completely in the top 4 race
Lame pundit Paul Scholes dissing Arteta for arguing on behalf of his side. That’s part of the job.
U deserve more sir arteta
Can anyone explain why Arsenal was given a penalty when he was in an offside position even before the foul had happened?
Happy fasting elneny
7:59　トミー！
Everyone talks about arteta. Saka. Odegard. Xhaka and tavares no one talks about 𝐌𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐭 ELNENY. 🥰🔥 When you see arteta and his assistant coaches how they working all  you feel what they want is a success 👏
The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.   (Proverbs 15:24) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
At 2:00 - 2:15 he was probably thinking “NOT AGAIN GET IT OUT” followed by such relief. The amount of times we have conceded from poor play out the back in the past 3-4 seasons is ridiculous
Refree le gift diyako arsenal lai
Mantap bangtet
Артетим!
Every goal we score Mikel celebrate with his assistants ❤️❤️
Arteta is such a proud dad to Arsenal boys 😊😊😊😊
The left side of defence needs improving in the summer.
Dispatch that pen a like veteran 🥶🥶🥶
Great Elneny lately ! He almost makes us forget Partey ! Good to have him on the bench!
Tavares was awful. He made so many big mistakes, not just the penalty. He shouldn't start.
THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD WHEN WE DEFEAT MANCHESTER UNITED..
Tavares needs more sliding training
Arsenal is like a snake in your pocket. you cant predict when it will bite you. arsenal is just unpredictable. they win where you expect them to loose. who expected arsenal to loose against crystal,brighton and soton but win against high flying chelsea? The same way they will win against spurs and west ham but loose to LEEDS and newcastle.
冨安のシーン映してくれて嬉しい🇯🇵
Hope paul scholes is watching
Bro the atmosphere was soo flipping good! Such a good feeling to be an arsenal fan nowadays
i usually watching Inside Anfield and its good,but this is very good video concept.
Merverous , fantastic
We're back on track it's time we show consistency in the remaining 5 games to qualify for the UCL spot. COYG
Whoever hates on Xhaka needs to spend time with him. Leave it to Arteta' to Change Perceptions
Arteta ada kenaikan kelas dg musim kmren,  Tp filosofi ini justru sudah di tinggalkan oleh MU semenjak ferguson tdk melatih MU
All this time I saw Rangnick only twice. A benchwarmer.
We have two great RB.But we need one more great LB.
In every game between arsenal and Manchester united if xhaka scores then that goal is the final one in that match 😎😎😎😎😎
These guys are building a proper squad for us.. Funny how some fans dont see it.. Those shambolic years are over its about passion and desire to fight for the batch..
Here is a verse that tells us the truth of God's love for us regardless of our mistakes or our guilt. We can come to Christ today and he will embrace us with open arms.    "Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? (As the Scriptures say, “For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.”) No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.  And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Every squad needs an Elneny, true arsenal ride or die but is also willing to learn and seems to be very teachable. Those forward passes that I’ve craved from his are creeping into his game. The three losses back to back, we were missing that destroyer imo.
amazing result but if we play like this defensively against spurs we will be smashed
We've seen Wenger's squad.. Now we r witnessing Arteta's Boys.. All we need is to support the team,down or up.. This is our team,our Arsenal.. Whatsever the pundits r talking about,the way of how we celebrate,our team celebrate or our manger celebrate,its just part and puzzle of being a pundit or they actually feeling sore whenever their former team dont perform..i really think the pundits,whoever they r shld grow up and digest the truth of the situation..
Yesss I'm very very happy
8:23 Arteta "what is time now"
Love Mikel's passion what we were lacking fora good number of years!....Carry on Mikel!
Real entusiastic character our manager is !!!! I love Him
Arteta is a mental case in the sideline bruh 😂 what is he doing with his hands??? Do the players even know? Must say I love the passion
With Arteta,teams are playing 13players instead of 11(the fans 12th,Arteta 13th) 😂😂😂
Yeah, Arsenal ll play UCL 💪
Arteta almost missed the Xhaka goal, that would've been unfortunate 😅
I love this team 🥰
I don't think arteta is good manager
I liked the way it said (3-1) penalties ain’t part of the game Arsenal plays
1:38 Mo rehydrate without drinking, because its Ramadan
I love what am seeing at 7:40...Great Manager Great Mentality
Albert is one of the most focused people in the game look how he took off his glasses in 7:21
Nice Arteta 🔥🔥🔥
This guy is a lil pep for sure🤣🤣
I like arteta's reaction everytime his boys score
Are Elneny fasting on this match?
COYG🔴⚽️🔴⚽️
The youngest manager and youngest team in PL. Arteta got passion 💯💯💯
super glad that Tomiyasu is back
sampe segitunya lo nonton cuk,, lebay sat
Get the Champions League
Absolutely magnificent
can anyone appreciate how Arteta has brought the passion and identity back to the club? I dun think it is as easy as we think. Of coz we will still need to see if he is the long term solution, but let's not take all the intangible success for granted
Ati2 kalo selebrasi biasanya aja nanti banyak yg kesenggol
Even if we don't get into top 4, I back Arteta. We need to step up against mid table clubs too.
Pyramid Pirlo ELNeny 🥶
Yo one thing Arteta need to stop clapping when this players make mistake let me know your anger while they are in the field sometimes 🤷🏾‍♂️
Most undeserved victory u will ever see.
I'm arsenal real fans
The bench cams are so much louder this year compared to previous years, I love it!
I can’t wait for All or Nothing: Arsenal! When’s it coming out??
Saka our love always
The fans were amazing
I love watching BENCH CAM
Good...
Woooow Gooners proud to Be a Gunner⚪️🔴💪let's do it this year!!
Arteta is happy about Tomiyasu ‘s comeback.
What a game! Let's get win next game!
Keren cuyyyy
2:08 Arteta's literally like a conductor in a orchestra here👏👏
same Pep ......
GOONERS INDONESIA NGUMPUL SINI 😁
god i love this club so much
Why was the penalty awarded , though a goal was made after the foul. Shouldnt that goal count.
3:49 I’m impressed with this
Very good
Arteta will eventually come back to Manchester city
Love this team❤️
😍😍😍😍
our coach manager mister Mikel Arteta need's our support confidence and support goonerd goonerettes,because him with commitment courage humillity respect propositivity decission love awareness rensilence perseverance good actions good attitudes are showing the best of him for the goodness of our team Arsenal
Kwaku BOTAN was here
Uncle Granit and Uncle Mo in midfield guiding the boys. We will need them these last few games
Tomiyasu gets to stretch his legs after coming on after months out and have a nice run down the flank ..only to be fouled..welcome back to the Premier League, my son...so great to have him back
I like Arteta, a quite, humble, hard working guy, I hope to see his succeed !!!  He will become a top Manager, I am sure !!! 👍
Can we get Chelsea benchcam
COYG！！
What a feeling to win a game as an arsenal fan😌❤
Daily reminder: Ø is pronounced like Ö
Mikel arteta 😍😍🥰🥰
Building this team steadily like klopp did Liverpool. Everything about Mikel and his boys reminds me about klopp and his Liverpool journey. They soon will be unbearable.
Love you arsenal ❤❤❤
We must pray to saka 🙏🙏 The future! Our ⭐️ boy !!
Love the gunners.been the fans since the sixties.up up and the away.down look down.focus lads.take one game at a time.5 more games to go.believe in yourselves.el you played superb the past 2 games.i reckon U should start again.well done lads.go U gunners.
BRAZILIAN fan here
No need  coach in  mancheseter you just throw away the players who come because there are 98 percent of stars there is a change
❤️❤️
abgDo cincau!
It's always nice to see us beat Man United! Never get tired of watching the highlights and this superb bench cam
ElNeny during the water break just washing his face because of ramadan. Fair play. I am not muslim so i can't imagine how difficult it is and not only that, he has been fantastic.
Arteta..remember the boy name elneny..he safe your job 😎😎
They have a jury that they are going to lose all their games. I am going to do the impossible so that they lose them and do not qualify for UCL.
Xhaka player of the month❤️
Love it!
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
7:59 he is back 🥲
The security guy loved that last one!
When I look at Mikel Arteta I see a man with a lot of belief
The best is 7.35 when he pulls Tavares and tells him to dig deep and believes him
In the 7:14 can see a steward silently punching the air...
My manager ! 👏👏👏
At the end of the game, Laca clapped a few seconds and heads to the changing room. He's been a good crop but his heart and soul are outta the club. Just a lethargic body is left. Same league with Auba, Ozil, Guendouzi, Kolasinc, Mustafi, a bit of Pepe and a bit of Maitland Niles and a little part of Leno. Them players are similarly wired and synced. Weird.
We still haven't concededed from a direct corner...superb coaching..Arteta always pays attention to little details..which is very important in order to build a successful team
The coach is trying to emulate pep even in the dressing
I do think we lack stability in that back line. Our defenders and goal keeper are not in great form and that jittery nervousness is felt throughout the defence. Tomi will help massively with that. I just hope that he get match fit fast enough. Him being there will calm the defence and I do think that Arteta will shift the CB’s a little to the left when Nuno is going forward. Our CB’s know that they won’t have to worry to much about the defensive side of that RHS with Tomi there.
Arteta is a delight to watch. If only he can get his boots on to play, he'd😃. Elneny has learned a lot from Partey. His body movement and forward passes in the last two games are sweet. Well done Arsenal
冨安のプレーを載せてくれるのはありがたいです🙇‍♂️
This guy learned allot from Guardiola
As a season ticket holder since 73, I can say without doubt MA has brought the crowds back but also a good ethos at the club! We were just treading water and now we have ambition again! I am all for his process!
Great stuff..just great stuff!!
what was ronaldo saying to arteta?
Arteta doing the real life spiderman meme with elneny 😂
I hope we get a good centre forward that can play and boots the teams confidence even when we are loosing
日本から応援しています🇯🇵
Xhaka goal in all areas please!!!
The guards doing undercover celebrations with the fans every time after we score our goal is so enjoyable to watch😊😹😹
Ramadan Elneny 🔥🔥
I almost cried when my favorite player, Harry Maguire, didn't make the line up. But fortunately that day, almost every United player was Harry Maguire.
This is cinema
I love how Arteta connecting with his players
Good to see arteta pumping up nuno Tavares after all his mistakes and maybe that’s why he finished the game calmly
What a win I was there
Lol Pep wannabe
jesus the fans at 7:12 mad
I love the way saka seems to be the leading attacking player in the team going forward. Great game young gunz...
Arteta had to go learn sign language 😂 😂 😂
Love it!
Arteta's man management is beyond level.
Best bench cam yet
Just like pep, so expressive, always guide from the bench, such a passionate manager
bench cam is🔥
Arteta shows show much energy and heart I don’t care where we come I’m sticking with super Mik
Elneny is the kind of player we need as backup. He brings experience to that bench, calmness and consitency
Ayo ,meriam London ...temb akiin semua musuh musuhmu biar ...kita ke Champions league tahun ini .dan semoga kita bisa memegang piala Champions league musim ini ,biar kita buat sejarah kalau kita sudah pernah membawa piala itu pulang .buat pak Arteta semangat trus ya .semoga kita bisa menang di Champions league musim ini . Trima kasih .dari Bali ,Indonesia .
Babe, wake up. Bench Cam has arrived
Super mikel artetta
Great great video… love to see how he is reacting to mistakes like any arsenal Fan
Bᴏss
0:47 yeah
Trust the process fans enjoy happy and support the team & boss all the way. While Arteta out fans still moaning in their cave of choice 😅
Do you like Tomi?
Gaya arteta mirip bgt pep cuy, semoga bisa nular sukses kaya pep
The only reason why I never liked Elneny was his backwards and sideways passing. I'm glad he can pass forward now. Lol
this team, this energy ❤️
we arsenal fans can have a breather now cause we know we have elneny in midfield... never in my lifetime I thought I would say that but I'm really happy to say it now... just the site of tomi also gives chills... wow... we could end up being top four
Arteta is a good coach but would love to see him dress like a manager. Arsenal is a big club. By attempting to dress like Pep, he   is not doing this Big club a favour. Yes results are very important but it begins with manager presenting himself well!!
drink everytime arteta adjusts his jumper
Respect full for Elneny he is deserved  i have no't word's for this brilliant midfielder he is not play before Afcon and now play  dismissed  N'Golo kante and matominay
Wenger is not wrong for elneny
I love arsenal..ilove arteta
Great win for the team😎
he's like pep with hair
Who'd be a Manager!
Elneny , Xhaka,Odegaard 🔥🔥🔥
Super coach 🔥🔥
Arteta is a real coach!
I like it when the boss doesn’t let decisive decisions from refs to pass by . He raises the temperature inside the arena when he calls upon the fans to ask for more from officials such that decisions go our way. Yet another thing Ars lacked for years that all around brave character from the entire club
Whenever they release these it just shows most of our players lack intuition or that footballers instinct to move into areas and make those passes.
Fans mu mana
No matter how you feel about arteta as a manager you can’t deny the man’s love for the club…he has been through the best and worse of times with arsenal.
Regardless of whether we qualify for the Championship league spots or not..LETS SUPPORT ARTETA!👏👍👏💯💯
Arteta stepping on the pitch!
Cheers, Paul Scholes crying now
Xhaka is a legend! He showed today his skill how he can still contribute towards the Arsenal ❤️
El Neny our baby Gullit
Arteta 💪💪💪💪
El-Neny is fire man!👏👏👏
7:15 staff behind the manager is happy
Arsenal aways fans are quality the home fans not so much
Might send this to Paul Scholes
Hhhh
Mikel's smile after Xhaka's screamer says alot.
Mikels hair is only getting older but his backoff is only getting younger 😏😏
I love how when saka gets the ball, everyone is anticipating something to happen
The boss has changed this club. We were where Man Utd are but now look at us. AFTV crew can absolutely do one, Lee. If we finish top 4 we’ll be able to attract the players he wants. Hopefully Kroenke will splash. Arteta just needed time. Hopefully we’ll get some decent names.
GRANIT XHAKA! am i the only one who rewinded that goal at least 10 times. The stadium erupted! so nice for the guy , he has been huge this season . Im so happy for Granit , well done
Funny how Arteta was prepping a sub before Xhaka's worldie
on second thought..  that looks like sir!  oie mate can i squeeze  past,  one? and Arteta acknowledges 😂😂 man im goofy
I swear he'll introduce a new sign language
4:09 Arteta knows and acknowledged Ronaldo without any fuss . class
We need Elneny Xhaka and Partey In front of them.
Got to keep going..beat West ham n thats another nail in tottenhams coffin ⚰️
WE'VE GOT SUPER MIK ARTETA
stunning game from ramsdale
this is one kool channel, the passion of you arsenal fans makes me want to be standing in the middle of ye even though im a Norwich fan, my dad lives & breaths arsenal  as he lived & worked near the old Highbury for years before moving back to ireland
I'm 3 tittle, you 0, nemanja😱
When pundits say they don't like Mikel's behaviour on the touchline, what they're seeing is that of a young manager. Energy, enthusiasm, and drive! It's refreshing
I love my coach celebration
that aggresion and less back passes helps
At least Utd fans don't a have a long trip back up north. Always great beating the Mancs 🔴⚪
7:33 man management skills
so good to see all that
MARK TODAY, ARTETA WILL BE A GREAT COACH GREATER THAN THE KLOOPS AND GUADIORLA OF THIS WORLD. ALSO ARTETA IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPEN TO US AS A CLUB. IF WE SACK ARTETA OTHER CLUBS WILL COME KNOCKING TRUST ME.I HOPE HE STAYS FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND WIN TROPHIES WITH US.
amazing
Yo nobody gonna comment on this but ARTETA MAN IS IN SHAPE SHEEEESH!!!
That’s my club🥰 So proud to call myself an Arsenal fan 🔴⚪️ COYG💪🏽
Look how very confident saka is taken penalty after bad memorys..
Imagine doing a manager cam on Ragnick. The guy would put me to sleep. 😭
Hope this run of form continues till the end! COYG!
PEP cam=Bench cam i see no diff
4:51 I love how Mikel is calling for the players to keep their chins up after Ronaldo scored
Tavares is our problem for the last five games. Tomi is available for our next games. Arteta will manage this problem. If he can't, hard to place top 4 spot to play UCL.
Amazing  performance 👏
The Emirates is really starting to develop an identity.
Arteta is one of the best actives in touch line. This is the most important and very useful for winning the games.
I don’t understand those Arsenal fans who criticize this man, he is a decent coach
MOTM : The crowd
These players love arteta
Xhaka is our best player in this time. We need consistency and leadership player who commands the youngest players of EPL like Xhaka to place for UCL spot.
Arteta loves this club yo🥺his never settles till the game ends
Please we also need Arsenal vs Chelsea Bench Cam
Even Ronaldo knows that Mikel is boss!
Been waiting for this one
Ok Art',I'll give you that. Sept-bottom of Lge wid 0pts>3games(-9goals),ur tactics were being (rightly) questioned but u tried t reassure us fans by saying t: (an I quote) *trust the process; well I'm trusting, I'm trusting*
So thats how Ronaldo scored… getting his instructions from Arteta
all I want is champion league
Send this to Paul scholes
United are sht nothing to be happy about. harder game against West Ham, lets get ready! VAMOS
The good thing is Mo Elneny is fasting on this match, and still got an assist. Respect for Elneny.
I love the way Arsenal fans stand up when they see Saka given the ball,everybody thinks he going to score
Unbelievable atmosphere
admin pls do more bench cam moments contents , loving the passion and emotions there so much
Rangnic really doesn't care does he ahaha
We've been waiting over a year, all of the cards, the ejections, but finally: a Xhaka Boom 💥 I'll take it COYG!!!
b honest now;3 straight )an may l say) lethargic defeats t (so-called)armchairers; l ŕeally didnt (hand on heart )expect us t come away wit full 6pts becoz of us showing these mature connective displays in lass 2 matches.?I 4 1 was expecting us t b "turned ova" right good an proper f at least 3/4 even 5 in each game.Thks Art' f proving me wrong.
As an Arsenal fan, I hate United with all my heart. But I can't help but feel sorry Ralph Ragnarok. What a poor choice to come and manage United at this stage. His career's over before it even began
Ødegaard pass to Saka and everyone stands up, they know something is cooking right there🔥
Granit Xhaka really has a strong mentality and that's why Mourinho wants him. Despite his travails in Arsenal and with Arsenal fans, he keeps showing up and giving his best every time. I dare you to name one other player like that.
The roar...love it!! 🎉🎉🏐🔥🏐
Ok!
The way I love our manager ohh only God know may Allah bless our team at large thnk u
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😤🔥
Boss😎💣
Mini Pep.❤️
What was Paul scholes thinking when he call Arteta a disgrace
Arteta is doing better yet he is a young manager he only blanders sometimes due to lack of experience
he needs to buy his pullover a size bigger
Captain should be given back to xhaka , look at how he gets instructions n manage his team
Elneny looking great in the middle
This was awesome to watch, love our manager!
Crowd always gets up when Saka is with the ball and Mikel stopping himself from going on the pitch to meet Ramsdale
Arteta calling for holding after we conceded 4 shots and it just hit the post 😏
Was hoping to see more of bergkamp and Henry here but I guess that's for Amazon 🤫🤫🤫
There can't be better goal when fans ask to shooooot and then yo bang Xhaka boom score.. last time it happens was against Liverpool.. Happy to see his passion for the club
As Arsenal fans i'm happy for the result but we still have bad defend
Love Mikel’s passion for the club.
Arsenal is my blood  ...keep going 💪
Mohamed Elneny is so good🔥
I just love seeing man united loose to arsenal😍😍
アルテタはとても素晴らしい監督。指示、移籍全て素晴らしい。夏の移籍期間に注目だ。 1番好きな監督、チーム
Arteta should stop wearing that sweater.🤣🤣
Elneny was fantastic in this game.
Paul Scholes look away now!
Tomi-bloodclat-Yasu is back, the great wall of Japan
He even celebrates like Pep!!
I don't understand, This hesitating performance for Arsenal.
i think we were lucky to win this game
I'm happy for Mo I hope we can keep him. He is the perfect squad player for depth and he can do a job too. He always plays well for Egypt I'm hoping Mikel can see how decent he can be.
Big respect for Ronaldo 👍🏾
7:14 even some of the stewards are celebrating it’s good to see 😂
Give Elneny a new contract. He is so good🔥
I told my friend,look at this guy(elneny). His working rate is exceptional. But still arteta wouldn't pick him for starting 11. 1 of the reason maybe elneny signed by wenger..arteta if he can,he wants his only signed player by him to start . Regardless how poor they have been this season.arteta will start him. The worrying things for me as a Muslim that's fasting and I can even run 10 metres and felt Thirsty ,but not mo elneny,he's fasting.hes been doing like this for so long. He is a true believer ,hardworking, and never moans if he didn't get to start. And still support them from the touch line.while warming up. Smile, laughter. Atleast,my club celebrate together  as a team. Unlike Man United, 1 player scored, the goal,2 or 4 aximum player come and celebrated
Still need more urgency feels surreal but we do! COYG! Not the time to be timid. Let's go!!!
Every time Saka got the ball down that wing he got the whole crowd on their feet. Present and future of Arsenal. My starboy
Артета красавчик  его команда должен играть в лига чм
Didn't Simeone get carded and slammed for inciting his own fans?
Arteta has become too much animated because if he sits back than arsenal will fall asleep and won't play😂
Именно таким должен быть тренер великого Арсенала
Xhaka's shooting always lethal. His defending is brilliant. Respect for CR7..
With the players that he’s got, Arteta is doing a great job as manager, even to be in top 6 should be difficult on paper for this team.
Tavares should be serious and focused ,minimaze making faults
The more I watch , the more it gets interesting. COYG ❤️
1:36 Our Egyptian brick wall trying to wet those dreds made me laugh. Good game!
Lmao that knee slide after that first goal 😭😭😂
It will be good to see arsenal in ucl again
We have had memorable moments this season , big come backs and crucial games won. 🎯 fair play to arteta from how rock bottom we were till now . Competing!
Arteta loves every moment - great to see such passion. Let’s keep backing our young side 🔴⚪️
Next match should arsenal focus,
GODDAMN!! 7:13
Arsenal ❤️💯👍🔥
Top 4 or not, Arteta has made Arsenal FC a family again and I thank him for that. COYG!!! 🔴⚪
Gunners firing on all cylinders and what a Xhaka Boom.COYG
Oh yes been waiting for this one
Finally i was waiting for this
3:49 Mikel: Rams, Rams, come here, do not forget,  today you need consede a goal, ok? Rams: A, Easy boss, 2-3 minutes, i will do it. Mikel: my dog
Jeez, I can't cope with all this,, it's nerve racking.  I can't even imagine how the players are feeling.  We are SO CLOSE.!! We just have to believe, take all goal opportunities we get and try and stay tight at the back!!! Only thing wrong with Bench Cam and AAA is they are never long enough!
When the game stops and see the team around the manager and Man U player standing alone with no plan of action. Finally feels like we are building up something good here.
love you❤️👍
4:07 Ronaldo telling Arteta to go back to his box,  and then Cedric reminding him who the best Portugese on the pitch is
YES WE NEEDED IT
I love him
After so long the fans seem united with the club. I can see the match live as I live in India but pretty sure at home I match all the chants in the stadium. Idk why but this season I will remember for a long time. It is something special
Next of the match against Chelsea
notice on the second dalot shot which ramsdale saves to the post, Arteta immediately starts setting up the back 5 and getting Rob ready to come on. Which is why he's talking with the coaches two mins later when Xhaka slaps in the final goal, because his priority is helping out Tavares. great management, rewarded with a great team performance
That xhaka goal just gives me unending joy. What a turn around it has been for him. I would really want him to stay for atleast two more seasons until we get really good replacements and our young players mature. Hope we get cl this year
Atmosphere gave me goosebumps!
Mikel Arteta has learned from Pep Guardiola when refree don't give results in ur favour, start putting unnecessary pressure on them. Be as much dramatic as u can.
Love you Arsenal from indonesia
I cant wait for all or nothing to come out
Respect between Ronaldo and Arteta there
Both teams were poor had Ronaldo taken that penalty we would have lost the match. How many times did Arteta put his hands in his head when we made mistakes? Play like that against the Spuds and we will get turned over.
Only Nuno Tavares can cut back like ultra max pro & then shoots 30 yards above the bar like an average joe. People call his defensive skills unpredictable but his shooting skill is so predictable even de Gea doesn't move a muscle in an attempt to save it.
Wish we play with united every week 🔴⚪️♥️
We've got Super Mik Arteta❤️
please give granit xhaka some respect he deserve!
This highlights how amazing the crowd was
WE'VE GOT SUPER MIK ARTETA, HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED !!!! COYGGGGG
Can’t help but feel sorry for Rangnick he got throw into the deep end with this Man U team
The fans went into total delirium over that Xhaka goal.
I dont mind with Tavares not being able to defend IF he can massively improved his end products
🚀 BOOM!
❤️❤️❤️
7:59 Tomiyasu finally came back!
Too much PR and overcelebrations
Mikel arteta ❤️ Man man man never even sits for a second ❤️ we love you Mikkel artetaa💕💕💕
I love arsenal From Thialand
Still not convinced about Tavares... So chaotic...
the one thing for sure..arteta already build a huge connection back with the fans.
Tavares is such a confusing player to cheer for; he is both a threat against the opposition and against his own team. All jokes aside, he seems like he loves the club. I don't know how many of you have noticed, but he made a Canon gesture in his celebration, right before his unfortunate stumble. No matter what, we should all support him and make his game stronger. COYG!
I’m here to see arteta reaction on the idiot taveras
i was there..!!!
Clear to see ragnick is the boss and Mikel is a leader . My manager 👏
Bench cam chelsea?)
Arteta's coaching method is gargantuan! All the coaching staff are involved from start to finish, and he doesn't joke with their suggestions, you can tell from the way he listens. I love that man!
I love to see this vibe from all Arsenal fans and our bench.  2 big wins make me to rewatch highlights everytime. Good job Arsenal <3
We need bench cam for Chelsea game too please ❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Our defence  is shaky though?
Martin odegaard never seen a player like him what a guy
Miss seeing Elnenys bench cam reactions but it’s even better to have him playing well on the pitch.
Ramsdale and Arteta celebrated exactly the same way after that bruno penalty miss
Much improved performance
Ødergaard is A Baller Magic In Midfield I Just Dream Us Getting UCL Football
4:05 Cristiano tells Arteta about Cedric's handball
I think  Arteta missed a trick by not putting in El Neny against Brighton and Southampton. When you have him why would you go for a more inexperienced player like Lokonga? I can understand against CP since El neny just returned from the African tournament but surely could have started against Brighton and Southampton. Look how he played against Chelsea and Man Utd. Xhaka needs that kind of a player next to him so that he can move a bit forward in confidence. Anyways good come back by the Gunners. COYG!!!
I don’t know why as a grown man in Tennessee these videos and seeing the reactions and the sounds makes me so happy
Each time I see the highlights on my Time line I watch it again and again
With most teams when you watch the Manager on the sidelines it does seem like the boss and his employees. With Arteta it feels like a proud Dad watching his boys. It has a very different feel. You can see has a genuine love and passion for the club and his players. It isn't just a job for him.
Defensively we were on the ropes! Shocking at the back, but what a great result! Elneny, Xhaka and Ø were amazing for us!
6:16                        34 & 32  CELEBRATION
Making ordegaad captain is something that has proven to been very good.  I love how he doesn’t give up.  He keeps moving forward
COYG Love this team❤️❤️❤️
2:10 As much as I love Elneny and he works so hard on the pitch, he is lacking the vision Mikel wants a CDM to have. You can see Mikel wasn't happy with the side pass. Maybe its because Partey is injured. But he is a great backup. COYG
elneny playing forward passes really shows how good he can be and xhaka is unreal bench cam vids are soooooo much bette than access all areas
Agent Arteta talking to Ronaldo.
Im waiting for this so damn longg
You have to love arteta celebration 😀😀
*Ahhh... Lovely!*
One thing I’ve noticed in these videos, Xhaka always going over to Mik for fresh instructions, love that
This momen
8:50 Maguire the first one to go back in the tunnel
❤️
It's the classic neg colour grade for me
How many of you noticed Arteta called Martinelli immediately after Ramsdale saved Elango’s shot? ESR needs to help Taveres there. He can’t be left alone in that left back position when Ronaldo is there. Perfect substitution by Arteta. He is learning quick.
4:08 loved that moment between Arteta and Ronaldo
Access all areas please😃😊
this manager is something else. lacks the experience but can see he has experienced the winning culture and mentality under pep by his demanding nature which arsenal lacked for years.
1:46 please 😭 mikel had enough
Rangnick the whole video:🗿
We love you Arsenal
If only we could know what Arteta was telling Nuno 👀
Arsenal fan here. We out played United and it was great seeing Rio cry over the VAR decisions which went against United.
Still feels surreal
I can wake up each and everyday and watch over and over again....I love this club,so much joy and stress at the same time💗💗💗
The way Ramsdale celebrated when Bruno missed the spot kick was amaizing
Cristiano 🤜🤛 Arteta
The Egyptian king was superb💥
I love this atmosphere🥰🥺
3:49 I love that even Ramsdale came to Arteta for instructions
What was going between CR7, Arteta and Cedric @ 4:08
Arteta always off the line when he's talking to his players. You have to respect the passion
You can tell it was a hot day
Ronaldo one of the greatest of all time this guy a Legend for real
After Xhaka's goal watch the security jumps and celebrate  that's we are as a club.
I thought Arteta will poke a hole in Tavares's chest hahahah
What is football without Ronaldo one of the greatest of all time this guy a legend for real
Becoz of the anxiety we  have not been able enjoy our beautiful style of play...hopefully we would nail the top4 spot at Suds and put out a show in the last 2 games.
Tomiyasu is f***ing genius . We can't love him more .
Xhakaaaaaaaa Boooooom
Arteta is a beast on the touch line.
WE GOT SUPER MIK ARTETA, HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED
Guys we're playing with 12 full squad 😍😍😍😍 That's what I'm seeing👀👀👀 Gunners blow their devils upsidedown 😂😂😂😂😂
Just love the way when we attack our fans just rise up
Hope he never leaves Arsenal!
We can go unbeaten from now towards the end of the season COYG 💪 🩸🔴⚪❣
7:13 I can bet the linesman said "Oh Wow" 😂
7:08 he clearly didn't see that coming
Why did you cut the part where arteta was playing mind games with ref and inciting the crowd on the pen decision
Love my club❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mikel CR7 moment there
Hide this from scholes😂
i've been waiting for this content!!! AAA or Bench Cam, to see how animated our staffs, fans and players is, such an amazing atmosphere!
Please against west ham we need same formation...just replay Cedric with tomiyasu
love you all gunners❤
Love it
I love this club ❤
Elneny is playing well at moment.He even passes more forward than he usually did.
now this is all what i wanted😊😊
Football is a fair sport, sometimes you win, sometimes you Manchester United. Thank you Manchester United.
4th or 3rd is ours
Peter Drury  "Oh, maybe we had a glimpse of this result before now. Everyone was a little bit convinced that Arsenal would pull this, and they didn't disappoint."  "Arteta equipped and armoured his boys, his boys knew exactly what was required of them, and here, they've gunned the OLD men down."  "Manchester United are in trenches. The hope of top 4 spot is completely shredded. We're waiting for them in conference league next season."  "Good afternoon OLD men. Good afternoon OLD women."
Fan from Viet Nam 👍❤️
@Arsenal - yes the gunners are now in 4th place all this week COYG's !!!
I need that CL anthem back at the Ems. I NEED IT
@Arsenal - Xhaka BOOOM !!! 🚀
I love the angle we have of both managers. On our side, we have a manager who truly loves and cares the club with his whole heart.   On the other side, we see someone who couldn’t care less about what happens.
I wait this video!! YYEAH!!
We need to bring Gooners reaction series back asap !!
Can someone please send this to Paul Scholes 😉
You just love to see how much it means to Mikel, also Granit putting up the work for player of the month with those performances against Chelsea and Manchester United, what a rocket of a goal, it felt like more than just a goal for sure
Nothing like a bench cam to improve my Monday
Arteta is a man of many talents but clapping normally is not one of them
We love you
Great manager
Arteta’s passion is unreal! The fans have been amazing! We need all the help we can get for the top 4!! 🔴⚪️😎
