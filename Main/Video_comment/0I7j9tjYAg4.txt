Hahaha and the ‘ Haaaaarold!’
Omg totally forgot about this video 😂 love this, and it feels like we’re hanging out with you. I totally forgot that Harry had to delete a video 🥵
is that hyperpigmentation?
500 is nothing for Cal
JESUS
8:32 didnt expect a faith cameo
I love how Cal tries to hide the chip on the screen protector until the very end😂
Very old video but these two are my favourite they should do more videos
What is it with harry and jj not knowing their friends parents name
The eyeliner. I cannot even. 😂
Rhinoshield has been a big thing in France, big Youtubers threw their phones so many time because of them cause it always resisted
I love how 2 years later I still know the color of the shorts he threw off that boat lmfao  loved the claire de lune background track for the destruction of the ps4 btw
That Gymnopedie while Harry destroyed your ps4 was amazing
this is my favourite video
17:33 look at cal’s face 😂
Why does Harry say "cannae" like us Scots? Isn't he from Guernsey? I'm so confused😂
Need more vids like this Freezy, what a banger!
What a banger
*Punishment: “Customize an item of clothing from your opponent’s closet”*   Follow-up punishment… Harry still looks hot in anything lol
good video.
As soon as he said milk first I was laughing my ass off 😂💀 he was so confident too
20:13 Freezy trying to be slick by covering the small crack on the phone
It was corrina kopf
Extreme Forfeit Connect 4! https://youtu.be/Jiur7khA2kU
ive bin to myknos
This needs to happen again!!!!
10:43 So that was bs being as Harry didn't get to choose
Nah Harry lost me when he said he puts milk in first in a tea, should be a crime
Milk last is the only way to do it😂😂 if you do it the other way you’re a certified nonce coz that’s some weird juju
17:34 James Charles genetics just came out 😂
Lmao at the makeup bit!!!! Hahahahaaa
funny how cal covered the cracked screen protecter with his thumb there 😂
20:13 am I the only one who saw the little scratch/ break on the right top of the phone? :D
i feel kinda bad for freezy lol
Both of the haircuts this video we’re looking clean
Cal looks like Pikachu I can't-✋😭
Finessed ur own video and channel 😂

So Harry makes tea like Indians
What a waste man Cal where’s Harry’s link to channel
I really want to know who they texted ...
Wonder what video Harry deleted
That phone case is op because itachi was covering it with his susanoo
Poor freezy got violated in this video 🤣 can only guess who copped the last message was the ex, poor bogga

English gal named fiona …

Freezy do be looking like James Charles
Harry "I think I did pretty good." Lewis
Too easy
5:49
I adore Harry so much!!!
I’m fkn dead cal’s makeup looks like he used a filter
Not the career mode🥲😒😰😟🥺😪😓😥😢
Harry is so attractive
That ps4 breaking scene was fantastic
Omg the white one is itachi from Naruto that's sick
Harry texted his ex girl, it has to be, it has to be
After watching the fellas and seeing Cals thoughts on anime seeing him use that case is upsetting
We just witnessed the last kind of PS4 go extinct
17:33 Cal is just the embodiment of James Charles right here 😂😂😂
22:00 Harry 😆😂 ooooooooowwwwwwwweeeeeeeeee
Should’ve done the PS5
Milk in first?! You nutters
11:18 Cal looks like that mask from the purge 😂
The makeup actually suited cal ahah
Cal
Wait why did I think Simon and freezy were brothers?
English girl name Fiona
did anyone else notice cal covering the top right of his phone to not show the damage🤔
you make like 3000 per video. why are you so scared about giving 500 bucks to harry? i dont understand...
14:50 - harry
With the make up he looks like Gold-dust instead of Luke Chadwick
How can Harry really be living with cal for nearly 7 years and still not know his mums name 😂
that answers my question as to where the mukbang was filmed
*Calachu, I choose you!!!*
Jesus is the way the truth and the life no one gets to heaven except through Him. Repent before it’s too late it’s your choice... heaven or hell change your ways and turn to Him !!!
HARRY WAS SO CONFIDENT WITH THE EYELINER HDHDHD
why does cal look like a trans pikachu?
I think Harry has the best smile
Cal had one job to remember how he makes tea 😭😭 Harry knew with his little smile 🤣🤣
I put my milk in a brew before water tastes well nicer 😋
15:06  *Cal you put the milk last* Harry: You gotta completely wrong I out in the milk first you doughnut 😂😂😂
Harry chose to end is whole life with the PS5 🤣🤣🤣
The person Harry had to text to was Rosie btw lmao
cal brought that brand deal advertisement very sneakily wl u smart bastard, that question has setup written all on it
the message had to be Kate
Did Freezy just say that putting milk in tea last is criminal? What the fuck? That’s the normal way to do it
Shit video. Fix up
Calfreezy my love for you is strong but respect is quacking after this, Harry unfortunately made you look like a clown 😂
Anyone else put the milk in their tea last ? That is how I have been taught
that itachi case is so tuff
I think it is Harry's ex that it has been sent to
8:19  is it just me or does cal look like a 13 year old tried to turn him into Katya Zamolodchikova 😂
17:15 I see what you have done here what was you were making these you were like oh yeah a brand contacted me asking if we could use the phone case in a video boom that can go in the video that I'm planning I see you I know I see you 😂😂
Freezy kinda looks like the cart titan no cap 😂
Anyone know what video he deleted
No one talking bout how Harry puts milk in tea first?!
Is it just me or is the text to big for the vid
Obviously itachi 😍saved the phone 😍🔥
harry is weird why the fuck does he put the milk in first tf!
12:11 Anyone gonna talk about how harry used the axe the wrong way😂
We all know who cal texted lol
16:32
Lol
Me and harry both put our milk in first [ I’m finally not alone ]
So this is the makeup video, this had got me dead
0:21 that harmony was beautiful, you can tell they've lived together with that chemistry
Who all know the dropping phone forfeit was scripted for ad caus it said let harry throw the phone.
Harry looks nice on half sleeves
21:50 deffo Katie
harry is a sycopath
Can’t believe I guessed Cal’s mams name before harry

That contact forfeit haddddd to be Katie
I wanna cry for that ps4...

John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
You put the milk in tea first? Wtf? How can you tell how weak or strong it will be... that’s ridiculous. lol  So annoying how they *bleep* whoever it was they texted ? I guess that means we would know who it is? Possibly?
20:07 unlucky rhino shield, hide it all ya like Cal but ya thumb aint fixing that smashage xD
11:12 The Joker 2 trailer looks sick!
whats the point in having some of these challenges in the video, when you cant even mention a name!
I Didn’t realize I just clicked on a James Charles makeup video....
Ermmm they smashed a ps4
20:11 the phone got damaged lmao, ur hiding it lmfao
Something tells me freezy doesn’t know who itachi is
Calfreezy is shambles
Who Did Cal Send The Text To? Was It Kate Lmao?
Anyone know which video harry deleted?
im SCREAMING Harry was so confident putting on eyeliner
Harry applying eyeliner: oh yes OH YESS but in ancient Egyptian world harry!
Lord Itachi can survive anything
Harry's first car was an Audi? didn't he have a car before he became famous like a regular car?
Calfreezy with makeup isn’t real he can’t hurt you.                      Calfreezy with makeup: 8:15
Only me or did he hold his finger over top right corner of his phine everytime he showed it to not make rhinoshield look bad because he probably smashed that corner🤭
When he said “you put the milk in last” I’m here thinking 😳I’ve been doing it wrong forever
Does anyone know which video he deleted
Freezy looks like if Pikachu and The Mask had a child.
whay hasnt cal left W2s channal in discription
Do these phone cases fit for androids/Huaweis's?
8:20
Whoever sings hello by Lionel has my heart

The axe scene was beautifull
3:58 he said ....

Its a pikachu LMFAO
Forfeit?
Freezy looks a bit like the mask with the makeup
H
My friend dared me to wear makeup at school in 4th lesson just before lunch and i walked round and bare man callin me a batty boy. One kid in Yr 7 thought i was gay 😂 So he started being homophobic and then i punched him in his fat fucking stomach. Your welcome to everyone whos gay 🤝🏳️‍🌈
WHY DID YOU DESTROY THE PS4 FFS? WHAT A WASTEFUL PERSON A KID IN AFRICA COULD HAVE EATEN THAT
Freezys parents paid for him travel around the globe to go see his girl meanwhile my parents won’t give me money to top up my phone to text my girl smh 😔
not Harry using the axe the wrong way 🤦🏽‍♂️
congratulations you played yourself
Anyone else see that Harry was using the wrong end of the axe
Great vid!! come over and check our videos
Whats the point in doing that last challenge if you dont say name?
Awwww fuck you Harry i could have used that man i am stuck with my ps 2
Can’t believe Cal got down like that on his own video
why is harry's socks always dirty
Cal brush your teeth
Cal looks like a pikachu
Thats great advertisement for a phone case lol
harry is single now??????
Does the ps4 still work? 😂
Does nobody see that the glass cracks up in the corner and cal is just covering it up with his thumb? 20:11
harry looks LENG
Calfreezy lowkey looks like Gold-Dust from WWE
so we're not gonna talk about how the top right of the phone screen was chipped?
I'd rather look like a twat than have makeup on.
Milk in tea? Wtf
Who wis the text to on Harry's fone haha
The itachi utchia lowkey clean though
Is it me or does Freezys foundation the same colour as his teeth
Looking like the grinch
Waittttt Fiona my wife? 👀😡
Harry is lowkey kinda cute
What do you do when no one else is around?  🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤
first cars cannot be an audi or a range... ffs mine was a volvo s40 2000 model shit was slower than a push bike
Fun fact: every video with Harry in the thumbnail has over 1 million views. Every video without him apart from 16 has under 800k.
Poor cal
RIP PS4 11:41🤣
The sparkling quiet osmotically trouble because reduction kinetically rock between a motionless taurus. garrulous, flat anatomy
Should’ve smashed the ps5
Calfreezy looks like the Pikachu meme
19:39 anyone else think that sounded familiar 😂
I just found out that Harry and Katie broke up, I kinda knew it but hearing it didn’t make it better. I’m confused tho, when did this happen? I recently saw a video where he still mentioned Katie.
Bruh the phone screen cracked the first time he covered it up with his finger lol
with the makeup freezy looks like katherine ryan
Why Harry got cal lookin like iron man
Ngl, not a bad way to transition into an sponsorship
Oh harry I love you but your never doing my makeup 😂😂
The question about the shorts i knew straight away it was yellow shorts 🩳
No daMAGE (covers top of the screen where the crack is)
HARRY ADDS MILK FIRST WTAF
22:19 i feel left out
New James Charles?
dude lookin like Pikachu lmfao
I feel betrayed with this clickbait... :(
Anyone here because you thought it was a sidemen reacts
Harry with the big brain sponser
That ps4 smash moment was hella eye-grabbing. That scene should get an academy award winner
Freeze, after the second throw Harry managed to break it on the the top right corner. You’ve been holding your thumb there the whole time. And same at 23:11 you’re also holding your thumb there
haha i cant stopp laughing at freezys makeup
8:45 is it me or does he look like james charles
This video is for Sri Lankan food lovers, Harvesting and cooking Asian cuisines.  https://youtu.be/HIPdFTSWXA  🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Tbf, i knew cal wouldn't say who he text, i had a feeling it was rosie or katie
I'm pretty sure it was katie leach(Harry's ex girlfriend) to whom it was sent
Cal with make up on gives off big vibes of Marty from Madagascar 😂
i know i did not just hear that harry boils the water on a pan when he makes tea goodbye
Why tf didn’t you tell what she wrote back at the ending?
Harry’s second throw: “you’ll be sound you’ll be sound” 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Harry's first video came out 1 day before I turned 6
gymnopedie no 1 fits in perfectly for the ps4 death R.I.P
Nothing better than hearing Clair de Lune as Harry smashes that ps4
Is it just me or do those sideburns look really good on Cal?
Harry asks two questions in a row after paying 500£
should of done the ps5 he wanted this challenge he should of took the consequences
James Charles didn’t get a feature in the title
Should've distroyed the ps5, wrecked the video
why does cal look like thing 1 and thing 2... lol
Yugioh pack opening was sick 😂
0:42 harry sounds like ksl
How come we can't know who the message went to
Rhinoshield is a scam Did not withstand a 3ft drop 😑
Did anyone spot that cal was covering a little mark on the phone when Harry threw it at the wall? Or was it just me 🤣 top right corner
The funniest sideman at his best
The sidemen should do this with Calfreezy in it!
was it just me or when harry smashing the ps4 with that bgm was very meditative
my favourite part of todays video is the montage of harry smashing the ps4 with the uplifting background music
I love how Sam is called Camera man Sam.
love the orange teeth cal
is someone was gonna break a ps5, i’d want it to be harry
Someone work out the video harry deleted
The shortsleeved hoodie  actually bangs
Harry did Cal dirty by adding contour. He made my boy look like an axe! 😂😂😂💀💀💀
His content is keep getting good.
My 2 favourite cocaine heads yay
Freezy “ He lenged it” Harry with the most nonchalant throw I’ve ever seen from and says he’s surprised the phone is still intact.
My name is actually Leighton
this is the only collab that a youtuber has done with a company that i’ll actually consider buying
You’re so dishonest, you literally cracked the top right corner of your phone and continued to tell us that your phone held the impact.   If you don’t believe me go to 20:12 and at the end of the video and see him cover the top right corner of the phone.
man picked itachi, a man if taste 🤩
ITS THE RED LIP FOR ME!!! <3
Would have been an awkward sponsor if the phone broke
Hey I only have 10 subscribers, but I'm hoping after you read this, I'll have one more 😊
He looked like morgzzz mom
He better be wearing that hoodie on the nexted sdmn shoot
Harry puts the milk in first when he makes tea...he's smart. Not like other freaks when they put the milks in last.....melts
Banger of a vid! Keep the grinddd
In the thumbnail his makeup doesn’t look bad
How did YouTube comment on YouTube
I beg someone photoshops a Marge Simpson wig on his head with that makeup😂
Cal you do be looking good in that red lippie though.
best part of this was clair de lune ayeeee manz like debussyyyyy
W2s challenge excepted📹🎥📷https://youtu.be/4ftWUVwSPPQ
Even I know his mom's name. It was a question asked in sideman roast, how well do you know me... 😲
Do they ship internationally like USA or sum like that for the cases bc it show up as different currency bc Im trying to get the Itachi case
why do i just see taylor swift everytime i look at cal?
Anyone else get quite sad seeing harry axe the PS4😂
his makeup makes him look like one of the townspeople of whoville from horton hears a who
freezy doing a brand deal in dead makeup😭
That Claire De Lune moment though 😂
Freezy looking like pennywise with that makeup on
Blurs out the only good bits XD
Did u say my name
Erm I’m sorry
The Next james Charles?
There was damage to the top left of the phone, Freezy was just tryna cover that brand deal 😂
Call him glossy eyed Harold... you know he’s off the boof pack
Am I mistaken or did he constantly hold his phone very awkwardly in the exact same spot after all the throwing, as if it had a minor damage?
Anyone else enjoy the Claire de lune OK no just me OK.
Wasn't ps5 he broke white ps4
ok but they didn’t know who itachi was
dat classical music banged
When his first video was on my 3rd bday 0:
Who else saw the chip near the top right of the phone and cal tried covering it
Just wanna know who text sent to
@20:13 u sure it didn't get damaged as u keep covering that area up after hahaha
Rate ur hopefully itachi case
calfreezy lookin like Talia Mar
Why tf did i think cal was james charles?!?
*How do I make Tea?*  Is the most British question I've ever heard
It’s so funny how cal actually cares how the makeup looks “can I have them wing eyes they always look nice”😭😭😭
Well Isn’t this a bit gay
That makeup was black face
Cal brush your teeth lad
Cal out here looking like the grinch.
What a way to advertise for the rhinoshield lmao
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Itachi took a hit
POV: you’re scrolling through the “collab only YouTuber” comment and trying to find a reply that doesn’t say ‘he is on the second channel’
Just a hammer and a few nails and the ps4 should be up and running again 😅
harrryyyyyyy
Who did cal send the message to?
Song 11:12
Does he not know that is Itachi 19:10
Calfreezys face properly irritates me
does anyone know the video that was deleted
FIFA’s put me through that much pain the ps4 smashing didn’t even phase me 😂
He must of sent that to kate🤣
love how harry manages to keep the sraight face when talking bout making tea
I'm actually so disappointed that Harold didn't go full send and smash his PS5! 💩🏠
Is cal gay?
Clickbait
these forfeits are quality
Why he look like the dragon from shrek?
He looks like the gay version of James charles
No cap, that short sleeve hoodie kinda bangs
Wait... Jaackmaate is dating calfreezy’s mum?

The Nandos question 'I haven't had the rice in about 6 months" Nandos was closed for about 3 or 4 months over lockdown so how does that count haha
So uh we ain’t gonna talk about Harry’s forearms?
Gayyyyy
He looks like the grinch with the make up lol
cal's face at  17:35 is a total meme  i died laughing 🤣
Just saying cal asked the same question in MoreSidemen and Harry couldn't answer (What's my mum's first name )
Man looks more like a giraffe now lmao 😂😂😂😭
If anyone fancies checking out a crazy eating challenge we just uploaded a new video yesterday! (CAUTION: Vomit warning sorry)
What a waste of ps5 people who couldn’t afford that and who wanted that could of had that
Cal looks like the dragon from shrek 😂
BTEC James Charles
Fiona will be fuming 😅😂
I wondered who Cal sent the message to, but now I have an inkling as to who it might be. And it has to do with W2s status as a single man
Why does the makeup look yellow
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com
as someone who cant afford dis shit. It breaks my heart to see a good ps4 being smashed to bits
I stopped watching once I saw Cal's make up. He looks disgusting.
There's a Christian website with over 70 interesting essays/blogs on it. It's www.thelivingtruthofgodblogs777.com Jesus Christ loves You
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ3W0zgUrszY4aOPkYsDy4Q
I was thinking when cal was talking about puttin the milk in last i was like everyone puts the milk in last 😂😂😂😂
Who else here was happy when he chose the itachi case
That text was definitely sent to Katie
Homo Sapiens in Sangiran https://youtu.be/8xe4NNUCSlU

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwvIvHif4DDuTkywryCLDzA
He looks like millie Bobby brown
Stop cooking cigs cal :(
damn freezys teeth be more yellower then my dehydrated piss
Freezy: My parents paid for me to go visit her but little did they know i was on a mission😈 Nobody: Me: So your parents basically paid for you to go have sex?🤔    Therefor Cal could have just waited rather than being paid to fly out (and do sexy time) cause that’s a more desperate move than waiting. The money could have been saved towards Cal’s future savings at the time or his family ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   And i doubt cal is the one taking my comment down every time, so have fun if you want to keep up taking my comment down. Don’t know who wants to keep taking a comment down if you’re not busy removing everyone else’s offensive/non-offensive jokes.
that hoodie actually rocks
please do another of this kind of video with all the member of the sidemen
If someone dont knows why football was introduced then let me tell u .once upon in ancient times these was a king who had a slave who was very greedy .he did everything to kill the king .he made a deal with the king's enemy and when the king started war with his enemy his slave betrayed him and killed him with the sword and the fact that u want who introduced football well honestly i dont even know either😂 ...thnx yall for reading this comment carefully

Honestly, he looked like a second-hand pikachu.
I wish my mum n dad could afford to get me ps4 for Christmas I hope maybe when I get older when I’m 16 I can buy 1 for me and my dad

Did anyone realise Harry was using the axe the wrong way 😂
Harry being single has made my evening😏
That was some setup for an advertisement, chapeau
13:47 Quick plug nICE WORK HAROLD!

Omg
Cals eyelashes made my eyes water so bad
Was the sidemen gift video filmed in cals roof ?
Wait who did he send the text to
Cal= Pikachu
Yet another video where they show they have too much money and destroy perfectly working things.
7:32
Zaberdast
Haha, Calfreezy's attempt at cosplaying Pikachu
20:13 you can see the top of his screen is cracked and then he covers with thumb for rest of that bit. Fair enough a phone shouldn't go through that and it is a great case to have such little damage. But that was dishonest.
Fiona is not a mums name. It’s a shrek name
Whenever Harry’s in a video it bangs yes!
his teeth are as yellow as his makeup
Calfreezy with that makeup REALLY makes me getting nightmares, he looks like a semi monster , a pictured skull who wants to kill you by a heart attack in your lucid nightmare
Does anyone know where harry bought the first hoodie and what brand it is?
Harry ft Pikachu

Why does Cals foundation shade change after every angle? 😂
I’ve never seen a better edited video
At 0:42 harry sounded exactly like ksi right then🤣
The text was obviously to Katie
I know you're not as rich as Harry but do we really need 6 adverts and a product placement in a 20 minute video?
come on man , you were covering the top right part of the phone cause the screen protector broke .
I swear he texted Deji
not the eyeliner and lashes on the EYELID.
Freezy looks like the dragon out of Shrek with that make up 😂😂😂
The video quality (like the actual image quality) was real nice and clear this time round, made it so much nicer to watch
I really want Harry’s customised white jumper tbh 😂
When I saw the thumbnail I thought it was James Charles ,good job Harry
Itachi always being the sacrificial spawn for others others gain. If you know you know.
If the PS5 was smahsed this video would have gone crazy with views and subscribers
20:13, so we pretending like that crack didn't happen?? Shambles lool
19:12 did freezy not know itachi’s name lol
What was the vid Harry deleted?

Cal low-key looks like Sarah
The same current family hang because chance dolly trust times a mighty point. nine, probable sweatshirt
How the fuck dose Harry put the milk in first
Cal with makeup looks like when your gran puts makeup on to go out for dinner
Didnt think that Cal could get any uglier... I was wrong. Also, when making tea or coffee, milk goes in LAST!!!!
The naruto one looks awesome could someone send it to me for free
Mans stayed hiding the top right corner of his phone lol
When itachi uses crows to keep the phone alive

Freezy bro, please do a video on who you texted and what was their response 🙏🏼
Bruh wut happened to harolds eyes, looking like he smoked tons of crack
im sorry Freezy but u get a dislike i never could afford a console , like most people that watch this and you destroy it like its nothing to get views , to some people its the same as filming a dead body in a forest
hands down one of the best videos of seen on youtube in a long time
Freezy and the "Cant-say-the-letter-S" are the most underrated uk youtubers that is!
why the f is Harry so good at putting on make up ? is he secretly jeffrey dahmer ?
That ad was cringe
Oml they bought the most yellow foundation 💀💀
I stopped watching as soon as cal got his makeup done idk but for some reason that disturbed the shit out of me
Harry: “I never wear this” but you can lmao 😂
So is nobody gonna state the fact this this was quite gud 0:18 to 0:24
cal pick up a toothbrush allow it.
Haha
Cal dropping bangers recently 👌
If only we knew what Katie’s response was after that text😭
I have the same bowls as them.
I lost respect for Harry. Milk first? Disgusting
I’m in the toilet doing a 💩 and the exact time when freezy said the “forfeits are pretty ass” I was wiping at the same time today’s my day
The real question is why does freezy have so much makeup in his flat?
im done with this bum calfreezy is the shitest youtube channel from the uk
Freezy with makeup looks like Stephen Tries 😂
Everyone who watches this idea should PayPal harry £1
Please tell me no ps5s where harmed in the making of this video
complete wrong colour of foundation FYI
Cals been posting 🔥 recently
Last night I had a nightmare of Cal in makeup. It was not fun.
Been on sun beds cal? Teeth are looking brown
17:11 one of the weakest acting scenes hahhaa
Freezy tried to hide the crack on the screen after Harry hit it off the wall😂😂
Callux or sarah
freezy looks like the grinch ngl
Cal trying to hide the smashed top right corner of the phone with some slight of hand like houdini 🙈
So now I’m getting make up adverts
Cal is the best dressed YouTube in the uk
Anyone notice that harry was holding the axe backwards
15:07: Harry‘s inner Gordon Ramsay just came out for a quick second there👀
Cal would’ve been closer, saying 0 times instead of 18
Was there a crack at the top cal kept putting his finger on it ?
he looks like the dragon from shrek
Ngl, that was a SMOOTH transition to a sponsored video
Me realising that the roof of harrys flat is where the sidemen mukbang was flimed and not just a random place
Cal looking like Marge Simpson lol
Imagine promoting a brand with that makeup on
Callux is punching the air at the title
This is a banger
my indian dad always wish to destory my PS just like harry did.
freezy has yellow teeth
Bruh the phone broke on the top when Harry smashed it against the wall and cal kept holding it on that side and covered it through
I generally swiped off the video because of the entrance of seeing cal with make up terrified me
Callux is crying rn
LOOK AT CAL MAKE IT SOUND THAT RHINO CASE IS OP BUT I SAW IT BREAK MY FREIND WHEN SLAMING AT THE WALL FIRST TIME      AND ON TOP LEFT IT DAMAGED BRUHHHH

Fuck off calling us broke- that shit is sold out everywhere in the states
😂😂😂😂I can’t take this add seriously
First i thought you did not have makeupp on, lol 😂
His face looks like fries with mustard and tomatoe sauce 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do you know how much I’ve wanted to swing an axe at a PS4 bc of FIFA
Why do people keep saying poor people could want it for Christmas? Like it’s a tiny bit rude 🤦‍♀️
It’s criminal to put the milk in first
Freeze looks just like Christian Erickson with that beard
That text is definitely for Katie 😂

Calfreezy looks like an Ogre...
It genuinely made me feel sick looking at Cal after he got on the makeup
My man put Claire de Lune on the destruction scene, legend!
I’m guessing the “I miss you” message was to Katie

The way they pretended to get 2014 correct 😂 I respect it though, gotta get the bag from the sponsor
who did cal send the message to from harry's phone? anyone?
So calfreezy is the " Blood sucking Leech " that Jackmaate was talking about in the sidemen roast  video , Harry is so done with Being asked " Can you be in my video " 😂
Wait harry is dating right?

He looks like a ghost
The smashing of the PS4 was a cinematic masterpiece
This is a banger @calfreezy

Cal freeze looks straight out of a horror movie 😬
RIGHT when Claire De Lune was about to drop...
that brand deal segment where they tried to smash cal's phone was so good and actaully persuaded me to buy 1

The text was to his ex wasn't it?
Does anyone know where Harry’s hoodie is from?
no cap, I was thinking yellow and red as well. (6:19)
Funny
Was that Harry's ex ? Cal said it's a 'her'...

Freezy looks like a mix of pennywise and the Joker
Thanks for playing Clair de lun in the ps4 destruction part. Such a calming moment
Where is Harry's jumper from? It's so fluffy

Cal looks like Pikachu with Harry’s makeover 🤣
17:25 Oi Hollywood, hire the mandem.

Does anyone know where I could get the Naruto iPhone case? I checked everywhere on their website but I couldn’t find it. If someone could drop the link or something I’d appreciate it a lot
Who do you think was the person that harry messaged?
I really want to know who calfreezy sent the text to from Harry’s phone
banging funny video!
Mate I can't believe I remembered the yellow trunks thats mad...
20;13 theres literally a crack top left loool
I thought Cal looked like a Btec Marge Simpson....
Uno the part where Harry broke the PS4 , isn’t that the same place where sidemen recorded there most recent mukbang and where they showed each other’s gifts in the sidemen spend £100,000 on each other video ..... correct me if I’m wrong
Harry's smile in this is so wholesome... it makes me smile!
Is Harry still in a relationship with Katie Leach?
Freezy rockin that Itachi case 🔥🔥
james charles wanna be smh such a fanboy
wah kinda bullaman thing is this going on in dis channel
We all know your thumb was over a crack in the top right, we caught you freezy

Cal looks like pikachu with the makeup on
That text was defo to katie 🤣🤣
Cal looks like the girl from Grinch
Freezy kinda looking like the dragon that donkey gets with in Shrek though 👀👀
Is just me or does that sleeveless hoodie bang?

Cal wearing makeup throughout the whole vid ha ha
I heard 3 hellos and thought zerkaa? Heard a fourth and thought well what the fuck

23:55 That Christmas cook off gonna be amazing. Can’t wait🙏
I really hope for Harry's sake the text wasn't sent to Katie. That would actually be so shit
Why does cal look like b-tech Taylor swift
Why harry is only good in other people's video.
Well I think weve found james Charles's twin
He looks like a real giraffe after the makeup
This is a banger of a video
Claire de lune playing in the background of the ps4 being destroyed lmao

Don’t ask y they have makeup in there house
11:20 Why does Freezy remind me of the grinch in that clip?😂
Lol right after the question about rhino whatever they cut and then a new clip was inserted which obviously they told him the answer and it was horrible acting lol it makes me not like the case more
Who else looked for itachi case and didn’t fans it and is now disappointed
Harry and Katie broke up? Why? When? :(
what video did Harry delete?
It was definitely Harry’s ex
Calfreezy always reminds me of cat in the hat
Sidemen filmed the mukbang on the roof lol
BTW the phone actually cracked from top left, you can see it 20:13, that's why the entire time he's showing the phone from the front he's holding the phone from there.
How did Harry manage to make freezy look more of a Giraffe 😂 8:09
James Charles vibes
What happened to katie
Harry went twice after the £500 forfeit lmao
i'm sorry but Harry is just so attractive !!
this is totally reminisicent of callux's "whatever you land on, you destroy" and harry does well in both
messi's number.. and maradona's. don't know when this was filmed but the timing is unfortunate
a w2s and freezy podcast would bang
Whats the name of the song in the ps4 scene?
I would have thrown that phone SOOO hard
This video was a Banger !🔥🔥🔥

Brooo when did he live in egypt???? Which years???cz i live in egypt and i regret everything for not meeting him. Btw i was raised in the same city he lived in (maadi). Would love him to reply to this.
3:01 lmao this is the second time Harry didn’t know Cals mums name and even I remembered it from that sidemen video 🤣🤣🤣

We want a rhinoshield design from you Cal! 🙏🏻
This is where they filmed sidemen mukbang daaaaamn
Nother banger from cal
Isn't it false advertising to try and hide that he's chipped the top of his phone and saying his phone is completely fine
Yoh Cal chose the Itachi one lets Goo
Cal can you only do vids when you are collabing with someone? It makes watching your vids bearable
Freezys parents just paid for him to go to America when he was 16 on his own just to see a girl he met on a holiday in Egypt. Parents must have ps you know
I realise YouTubers will do anything for money but looking this terrible shouldn’t be one of them. God bless the viewers
Katie cheated on Harry at a club my sister goes t her uni
This was all fixed towards a rhino case sponsor lol sad after I found out about that hahahah
Why did you bleep the video name out

Still waiting for freezy and lux to official become part of the sidemen.The idea from this guy is all bangers...
That text was definitely sent to Kate 1000%
Only Harry would get the name of the sponsor wrong
The foundation 🤣
Freezy looks like Marty the zebra from Madagascar
I guess the PS4 wasn’t worth taking.
Number one sign you’re watching a British YouTube: there’s something about tea in the vid
He looks like the giraffe off Madagascar
"I haven't got the rice in six months". Meanwhile poor me not having eaten out for over a year.
Looked better with the makeup on lad
what video was that hmm
freezy looks like hes covered in peanut butter
You can tell that Cal paid Harry part of the Rhino Shield money.
This one out of all them deserves a like.
Who els think cal looks like melman from Madagascar the movie 😂😂 the good old days
Calling it now, the text was to Katie..

Cal looked like michael scott in his movie
12:30  Still usable.
He looks like the dragon with makeup from shrek
My heart broke when that PS4 broke am so broke I wish I could have had that
Can I have a throw? Im a javelin thrower and would love to see if I can break it 😂
the way he was hiding the crack on his phone after throwing it...
High production ✅  Multiple camera angles✅ W2S in the title✅ Only one thing that means BRAND DEAL!!!!!
Harry laughing at 15:12 is hands down, the purest and cutest thing eveeeeer
who did cal send the text to?
Freezy with the makeup looks like Roz from Monsters Inc (the large green old grumpy one)
I could've used that ps4 yyyyyyyyy
dont think ive ever heard Harry plug sidemen clothing
On God... I thought they were brothers/siblings or something until I saw this... wtf... I was 1000% sure as well ahahahaha
Why is it so relaxing watching Harry smash a ps4
Cal with the makeup on looks like the dragon from Shrek
Back in Callum’s Corner for another banger😂
Videos with Harry always bang FACT!
You should put that hoodie up for bidding for charity

I beg Harry wears that hoodie in a Sidemen Sunday.
Cal looks like the grinch haha

Phone smashed at the top corner haha
Harry asked the tea one and the car one back to back. Did Freezy get finessed?!
the Maradona part didn't age too well :( RIP Maradona
Nobody: Absolutely no one: Cal & Harry: *puts the milk in first*
Spelling
at 20:14 he's hiding where the phone is actually fucked up in the right corner lmao
Cal looking like a washed up tin tin
Oh wow. Sidemen did a video on that roof top.
Freezys latest videos are bangers I used to think lux was the better youtuber but now I don't know 👀👀
Could i get that hoodie? Perfectly matches me
why did he censor out peoples names -_-
Whats the name of the song at 12:30
Why are Cal's teeth look so yellow
Why is it weird when Harry plugs SidemenClothing without any Sidemen around
I find it funny they still get happy over £500, at least they haven’t lost touch
I must say I’m very impressed with some of  freezy’s latest vids. Keep it up mate
I love how the ads came up when they mentioned not getting remover
20:33 he what  did he just use the word leng as a verb

I didn't realize that the gift video was filmed on Cal's roof 😳
Katie Leach uploaded a video of her going into the sea with another man 32 weeks ago so did they break up or no?

Calfreezy mum is Fiona and his dad is shriek who would of thought
He looks like pikachu
That you James Charles
Harry already had a forfeit being in freezys video
cal needs to brush his fucking teeth, i can smell his breath through the screen
Freezy knew this was gonna bang and so out 357 ads in the video.
weebs when they see the itachi case: 🤤
Harry puts the milk in first 😢
The forfeits where worse than Arsenal defence..
Anyone know the video he deleted?
Can anyone name the brand of freezy's blouse?
@calfreezy you look like dragon from shrek
Disliked cause of clickbait
was it katie?
it's like 2015
Doesn’t even know who itachi is
Rip PS4 :(
Was it Harry’s ex???
colgate, pls sponsor freezy
Its funny how much they (especially Harry) care about 500 pounds
I wonder who the person was the one harry sent a message to it would be jokes if it was his ex
They really mugged us with the ps5 thumbnail
frezzy had a stinker in the beginning 😅😂😂😂
Omg u got the monster out of his pit lol
rhinoshieds face when they see freezy plugging their product with shit smeared on his face hahah
Cal a naruto fan lol
I r8 harry for not destroying the ps5  Like genuinely r8 it
*That's outrageous*
anybody notice Harold holding the axe the wrong way
Bro freezy looks like James charl a bit
WHO IS KATIEEE      JIJP'HPI
we all know the top right got chipped be transparent in the future
Me watching harry smash the ps4 after he tried to smash the ps5 knowing I don’t have either one 😞
Brush your teeth Cal
I swear this is like the third time I’ve watched this video. It’s like double deja vu
yo calfridge get some charcoal on your teeth boss it makes them look way better its what i did
That phone did not survive, it got a couple of bumps on the top, just look how he always hold his finger on that point of the screen. I call false advertising.
harry dude work out, you will became a beast bro
Harry said Konami LMAOOO
That text was Katie probably
Don't cut out the names might as well not be in the video
I really enjoyed watching this video it was a banger 💥
I’m confused there’s been lots of jokes about Harry being lonely is he no longer with Katie
Tell me why Harry first guessed my moms name?! Lmaoo
When Freezy doesn’t know Itachi😞😞
LOOK AT CAL FACE IN THE INTRO  IM FUCKING DYING
I skiped the add waste of time
The phone deffo cracked ahaha
Cal is so underrated like if agree 👍🏼
That scene with the axe and music was gold😂😂
The music and slow motion while Harry is destroying the ps4 is jokes😂
The person that cal picked must’ve been Katie 💀
RHINOCASE hahahahahah
This was a banger 😂
Harry is pro with breakin electronics😂😂😂
Watching the sponsor for a phone case through a cracked phone screen... pain
Why are Cals teeth so yellow🤭
Have to say that transition into the brand deal was very smooth
Wait when did Harry break up with his girlfriend?
Is it just me or was Freezy’s foundation ✨green✨
Peng Ting Freezy
yessss i love this please make a part 2
He's smashed the the corner of his phone tried to cover it up with his thumb
I like that the screen got little shattered in the corner but since it’s a brand deal Freezy was covering it with his finger 😂😂 You ain’t slick my g
Is it just me or did Harry fit the hoodie
22:00 i have never seen harry so embarrassed
16:11 did they cut a question?? why did calfreezy did a question two in a round
Freezy: I don’t want to break my phone I’ll be poor   Also freezy: throw it at the wall again
Harry's fade is slacking!!
Send text to?
Wtf I was literally thinking that cals mum was called Sandra and then Harry said it. Creeped out
Great vid...do this with Simon
When he destroyed the ps4 that hurt I've wanted one for years and he just destroyed it :(
What’s the music 11:48 ?
11:20 What is that song called?
Cal needs to brush his teeth
is just me or Cal looked like a shitty version of Pikachu with the make up on
Make a podcast with u n Harry
Thanks for harry content
Freezes trim looks good
Harry is such a sweatheart. We must protect him at all costs. I hope he’s doing well cause sometimes he looks down. We love you Harry!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can’t take freezy serious looking like that 😂😂😂
Who else is only here because they saw Harry 🤣 sorry cal
my mum walked on me at 7:38 fam lmao
Does anyone knows what video W2S deleted?
Cal looks like the dragon from Shrek
I'm creasing at how harry went along with freezy when he said milk in last
NDL NDL
20:13 You can see there is a crack on the top of the screen but he covers it with his thumb! These idiots only care about money lol
oi cal what happend to herb
This is karma for that KSI drunk video
Pretty sure the person was Deji bc alphabetical order then he scrolled for a couple seconds down to D. 😬🤫🤫
The text was definitely to Katie
So you’re willing to paypal $500 but not willing to smash a ps5? Lame
Best video on youtube in a while
21:52   I am 99% that Freezy said Katie (Harry’s ex)!
11:15-12:33 Beautiful Heartbreak
wow, must be hard to pay 500 punds with only 3,5 mill subs on yt
Great freezy with makeup has entered into my nightmares and is never going away 😔
Jim Carey called and he wants his mask back Cal
This a banger I must say
R.I.P PS4 🕊🕊
Censoring who you send the text to makes the whole thing pointless
It's sad to hear Harry's yugioh pack opening didnt do well
Whenever Harry genuinely laughs it's the cutest thing ever 😂♥️ but also did anyone else notice Harry used the wrong side of the axe? 🤣
Loved this video !
Can someone check up on lux 💀
Loving the content Freezy. Keep up the amazing work lad. Much love🙏
I love it when these two are in videos together🙏
Instead of getting him to upload Cal makes him delete a vid 🤧
Do it with JJ next😭
Whenever Freezy uploads you know it’s gonna be a good day🙏
Absolutely loving the videos Freezy. Keep up the amazing work lad. Much love
It’s his ex 😂
Nobody: Weebs: Triggered about the fact that he said white phone case instead of Itachi phone case
Harry André 3000 of YouTube
So they filmed the sidemen mukebank on cal and Harry’s roof🤣 was wondering were it was 🤣
That throw against the wall was poor from harry
we know he text Katie, there was no point capping 😭😭 but i did feel bad lmao
My dumbass though it was Stephen in the thumbnail
Cal trying to cover that tiny crack on his phone when Harry banged it at the wall
This whole time I thought Cal and Harry were brothers
This is probably the best video I’ve seen all 2020
Why does freezy look like the dragon from shrek with makeup on 😂
R. I. P ps4
FAV COLLAB. I THINK YOU HARRY CALLUX AND CHIP AND ETHAN SHOULD FORM A GROUPPPP
All this time made in America was based on calfreezy
Now this is a BANGERRRRR
Has anyone noticed the itachi case
If only Harry posted on his 🤧
why is harry train to speak Scottish
who tf puts milk in first for a tea?
can't believe he puts the milk in first
Guys I think the questions in this video are outrageous but I’m not 100% sure
harold giving Cal the bambino becky look
harry made freezy into pikachu loll
Thats peak bro
Imagine Katie actually says yes and they get back together bc of this lmao
That case is actually mental
Harry and Freezy always making bangers they never miss
Itachi saved his phone
6:57 How am stell remember the yellow shirt  Looks like am descend sdmn fan
Ey
I felt it when I saw the ps5 and the axe
Calfreezy needs to brush his teeth
At 16 calfreezy’s parents paid him to visit his girl 🤯🤯
Cal would be kinda peng as a girl👀
tbf the yugioh card pack opening was sick
i didn’t think the yu-gi-oh video was that bad
🤣🤣🤣💀why’s freezy looking like the transportation titan from Attack on Titan looool
22:06 “pain”
Big up frozen and bog. Banger
Cal looks like a knock-off Grinch with that make-up lol
This was an absoloute banger
From make up to smashing ps4 Harry loving life
too bad Harry didn't get the make up forfeit I was hoping for a return of James Charles Harry
Do another one of these
Cal be looking like that frog puppet
who was the person
Definitely getting Grinch vibes from Cals makeup.... 🤣
One of best vids on this channel this year
Freezy with the DSL's bruv.
Calfreezy looking like psa 10 pikachu 😂😂😂
Ill take a paypal of 500 :) 😃
I love the way he still uses the ps5 as the thumbnail cheeky schmuck😂
the top right hand corner looks broken and you were covering it from the first throw at the wall (correct me if I'm wrong)
The makeup was such an eye sore
I’m Egyptian
In case anyone was wondering, the person who Cal texted was Harrys ex Katie because of the way harry reacts and after, Cal said I can't believe it was her. thank me later,
W2S waiting room
Ps5 in the thumbnail tho
I was lowkey happy to see the ps5 get smashed but sadly the ps4 took the hit instead 🤣🤣
Whenever Harry’s in a video it bangs
He look like a Who from off whoville
Cal:"There's no damage to the phone" Phone:help me im dying inside..
That sponsorship part of the video was soooo smooth.......didnt see that coming at all......banger of a video this....hillarious.
I clicked cos of the ps5. Well done Harry
Wait did Harry break up with his gf ?
The Clair De Lune at 11:12 really fit the scene 😂
banger video
The acting around the text message forfeit (which was fake of course) was pretty decent. Editing let you down on the continuity front though (Harry reacts to the name, but then goes "wait let me see who you're sending it to" etc. SLOPPY.
20:13 you can see the crack on the top right of his phone
Harry’s fade is awful 🥴
Calbreezy looks like my mom
He should hv destroyed the ps5
20:12 calfreezy hides crack on phone haha😂😂
That's how you promote something
Petition to do giveaways instead of destroying stuff. Like if your in
Absolute banger! Love the vid boys, lets get a cheeky more before 2021 eh?
smoothest ad on youtube 😭😭
The I miss you was so peak but funny as well
Freezy be like not doing this video again lost almost 2k on this lol
Just look when he picks up the phone from the wall... IT WAS CRACKED. right in the top right just next to the notch, and every time he holds it after that, he covers up the crack and claims there isn't a single scratch on it!!!  This gotta be false advertisement???
Ngl.. I just had a breakdown after Harry destroyed that PS4 remebering I could never afford it..
why do you  mute everything???
Itachi safes the day :D
but some respect on itachi's name @19:10
Ayo i would have been sad if he deleted the yugioh one.
On the first smack off the wall the phone chips but freezy the smart donny he is always covers it with his thumb, play it back slow and like when you see the small white chip
Cal looks like a yellow Grinch
who ellse thinks harrys the most attractivee sidemen
21:54 I think that’s his ex gf 😳
He has to wear that for the next sidemen tinder/blind dating video
Sad to see they didn’t call the case the itachi case 😔
Harry age 24 acts 9 years of age
Cal is passable in this.
Harry messaged Katie!!!!
hi
sad callux noises
Cal looking like a James Charles x pikachu collab 🤩
How did Harry end up destroying Cal’s PS5 and get £500 from him lmao
Highkey wanna see JJ and Simon do this
How can he even try and seriously promote his sponsor looking like that😂😂🤨😂
Another sick one
When harry was destroying the ps4 the music almoast make me slep
Talia Mar is shaking.... Well done Harry
Freeze quoted my carreer mode is on there
Why did that makeup make  Cals  face look longer 🤣
How did my man Freezy get done in like that in his own video?
when harry smashed the ps4 it kinda hurted me tho 😐rest in peace ps4
My carrier mode is on my broken ps4
Callux reading the title: 👁👄👁
was the contact Kate? ps a big banger of a video
harry did him with a talia mar special
I coudlnt take cal serious during the brand deal 😂😂
banger
Harry's one of those good people who puts in the milk first 👏
Lol when harry called cal a donut it reminded me of Gordon Ramsay
I'll be honest a lifetime guarantee for a phone case isn't that appealing, if they'd put up for a broken phone (if their case was used) I'd be sold.
You're fucking tapped if you think it was Katie. You can clearly see he didn't
They dont have worldwide shipping... im sickkkk i wanted that itachi case
100% the message was to katie
That case scene is fake I’ve seen harry throw controllers and chairs harder than that
20:13 quick put your thumb over the small break on the phone!
ohhh no a ps4
Me : Sees w2s in the title "that's enough for me"
He looks like Marge simpson
❤️❤️
STUPID YOUTUBE i didnt get a notfication and i have it EVERYTIME ON THIS IS A MAD VID GO ON LADS
Heroin Harold strikes again
That Itachi white case bro , did you k ow about Anime or Naruto? 😭
It’s my birthday
If you think about it calfreezy is actually a Top Don
Freezy should look into teeth whitening or something, man's teeth are yellow as fuck
the videos 52 mins ago and the comments are 1 hour ago👀
The customised sidemen hoodie without the graffiti is looking sick. A short-sleeve hoodie. Banging idea!!
Whatchu know bout that ITACHI case ;)
its funny how Cal's managed to hide the top right broken/ scratched corner of his phone hidden by keeping his thumb there the entire video XD. Look carefully after the first throw and you guys will see
Whats  the Video that was deleting
Freezy went from fella to felita real quick
Yo
how forfeits should be done an abosulte banger
Why are you covering the cracked screen?? I thought you were better person...
what classical song is that?
You can tell he said “raid shadow legends”
which vid they delete
He kind of looks like the grinch
harry just likes smashing things, weird guy.
I really wanna know who Cal sent the text to haha
I hope my channel will be as great as this one. Great channel.
yeah ? yeah.. yeah ? yeah.. no.....
20:13 the top right corner of the phone is definitely scuffed, freezy had his finger on that corner thought the video after😂
What banger video
Wow I just bought that white hoodie and cal violated it
Harry can rock the short sleeves to be honest ^-^
After this video every brand that has done a deal with Harry is going to check to see if their video is still up 😂
Cal looks like peanut butter baby
Smashing a PS4 like that’s going to make a dent in the bank account...
Only here for Harry
Fantastic 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
Im sorry but freezy for some reason reminds me of the Cart Titan
What video did harry delete?
freezy looks like the who’s in whoville
Man Cal is really on top of the game lately. Love to see it
Back in Chicago
16:30 - harry- yeah? Cal- yeah. ;_; Harry - yeah???? (You stinker) Cal- yeah ;;;;_;;;; Harry - nooo 😂 (you donut)
He hid a scratch too right of the phone
“ What is the real name of British YouTuber PointlessBlog”  Harry- 15:55
Harry barely dented that PS4 give it to me I reckon it’s t still works
under rated bangers from freezy all the time
Man literally looks like Goldust with the makeup on.
Looks like old vampire woman
10:52 - the FEAR in cals eyes is amazing
harry, the guy who's on everyone's channel but his own
I like your cut, G
The production is on another level
8:02 Cal looks like Shrek's Girlfriend Fiona..... Wait, Cal's mum is called Fiona 😳
freezy just got a last minute free kick with that message to katie
20: 14 look closely he's covering the damage on the screen 😂😂🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
I laughed so hard when he hit the ps4 in slow mo the music just added spicy
Who knows the video he deleted?
Petition to be able to buy that hoodie on sidemenclothing.com
Harry good at makeup you know ? Im pretty sure he learn from his mum .
Stop hiding the crack behind ya thumb shitty boy....
Instead of smashing all stuff in your vids you should keep them and hand them out to people in need. Would make a better vid
when i know more about harry than calfreezy his friend
Ok i get it your rich but stop smashing expansive stuff like ps4. People with less to spend could use that more than the ‘content’ it gives smashing.
haha he was quick to cover the chipped corner with the thumb on the phone :D it survived but man that screen was chipped probably just the screen protector so you should have show that XD aint that slick my dude :D
I was used to him in makeup
I still can't believe how GOOD LOOKING HARRY IS. 😭
Camera on Cal being out of focus sends me
the pain of him calling it a white case and not an itachi case
It probably shouldnt, but the constant switch between 60 and 30 fps is fucking with my eyeballs
Man used Clair de lune for the ps4 just to let us know how destroyed he felt inside
You can see the phone is a bit cracked top right lol 20:12 and he tried to hide it with his finger 😂
Harry should wear the *_New and Customized SDMN Hoodie_* for *_Tinder 4_*
The phone isn’t scratched also the phone a scratch on the screen
Clair de lune?
The mascara is the same colour as his teeth lmao😂😂
Ok but like why did I also think yellow or red? 💀
Does anyone know what the video was
No joke I love Harry 🥰
Harry saying that makeup looks good has boosted my confidence so much 😂😂😂
Cal : " Okay so you used to get the peas , the "   *ADS CAME OUT*  Nice moment there
*Big up Fiona for birthing a giraffe.*
hiiiiii omg hiiiiii please notice me
*Easy peasy freezy pleases*
Harry is the gunna of youtubers (only features in other vids)
Ey yo freezy be looking like a slender pikachu
Did Harry breakup with Kate
pool cal
Love how Harry has been into making videos the last part of the year
11:16 *_Cinematic Masterpiece_*
only the camera that focuses on harry is actually 50 fps. Other cams are laggy. Other than that a banger
.
Cal looks like a clown 😂
You got to admit these two combined are funny as hell
20:13 the phone is smashed in the top right but he hides it with his thumb
i cant get a case for my phone so sad now
2:30 :  Harry: " I don't know what your mum's first name is" Cal " [...] my mum knows your first name" Harry thinking: *I would hope so*
Anyone know the flannel Cal's rocking?
this video was fucking hilarious
Calfreezy looking like a Simpson with the makeup 🤣🤣😂
Banger video!!!!
What is Ur Egyptian girlfriend called and from which city is she from cuz if dem standards are that low I might have a chance

Freezy with makeup looks like the dragon from shrek
The Maradona part didn't age well
WELL INMM
Freezy covering the crack with his thumb hahahahah
cal freezy looks like my aunt if she had traffic cone genetics
Did Harry Break up with Kate?
20:12 you can see the top right of the phone smashed a bit and freezy tried to cover it with his thump for the rest of the vid, why you promoting a brand that doesn't even work?
Anyone know the name of the vid he deleted
I liked Harry positive side tho even Carlfreezy is annoying sometimes , he still be a good friend on him.
Itachi saved the village as well as his Phone
big up ma boiii Itachi
Cal looking like the giraffe from Madagascar jeesh
I beg Harry wears the hoodie when he does 20 women vs W2S
Like if cal have to make more of this video
To be honest i thought that harry threw res shirts of the boat no cap
What is that song
freezy be covering the corner of the phone
He is literally hiding the damage on the phone which is on the top right corner of the phone 😂😂
Nothing can destroy a phone protected by an itachi case
Wait you lived in Egypt??? what I'M SO CONFUSED!!!
the hoodie needs to be used in 30 women and 1 harry or tinder
Gotta love how freezy put his finger over a crack on the phone so his brand deal doesn’t go in the bin hahaha
This is a mad video uk
That axe montage was beautiful
Picture not pressing record
these two are always fantastic together
We need a youtubers cook off with KSI
Could I get the broken PS4. I need a few parts
Real ones sang along in the beginning
ITACHI
Uses the Ps5 in the thumbnail tho
Bro when i saw the thumbnail I was so confused and baffled I was thinking about why Talia was in the thumbnail and why her face was so long
btec James Charles
Was the text to Katie?
If w2s is scared of a £500 forfeit he must be broke now
cal you’ve only got yourself to blame you bought the wrong foundation shade you an ivory rose at best
Callux: Am I a joke to you?
thumbnail had me in deep confusion
what vid did Harry delete
Who did they text at the end
his thumb was literally on the same spot of the phone the entire time. What were you hiding there mister Cal? hehe ;)
Cal looks like an upma loompa
your parents paid, rich tinging
That plug was sooo scripted 😂😂
The music and editing makes ps4 smash satisfying
Nice to see cal getting into the Christmas spirit looking like the grinch
The make up dirtied cal's lips
Yo freezy what happened to fc rebel
Yo Sidemen make that T-shirt styled hoodie lol
How much we bettin that it was Kate he sended that text to.
Freezy low-key looks like an emoji with that makeup on looool
Only 50k views in half an hour👀
Did cal text Katie?
Imagine being a company paying money for these brand deals😂 I'll be amazed if anyone buys one of those shit phone cases after this video😂😂
u look like a alien in the thumbnail
This vid a madness
bruh without back ground music i jus feel awkward watchin vids
this was a banger cal. Harry and you are mad.
Who did Freezy text from Harry's phone was it his ex?
cal at 11:19 gave me the lorax vibes for some reason
this "single & ready to mingle" hit differently now that i know that harry and katie broke up
Cal looks like the giraffe out of Madagascar
I wonder what video he deleted does anyone know ?
When they shown the garden was anyone else like oh okay so the gaff they chill at is Harry’s
Gayfreezy looking like Taylor Swift u know
If you pause it at the right frame at 20:13 you can see the screen is broke At the top of the phone. But cal quickly covers it with his thumbs. That’s why every time after that he has his thumb in the top right corner
This shit has me dying good video freezy would love to see more content with big herold
At least there’s  Harry somewhere on YouTube
It cracked top right and he used his thumb to hide it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
last forfeit was defo to katie
We all know he texted katie
Why’s he looking like James Charles’s brother
Harry at the end bro I’m dead 😂😂
That itachi case is fire🔥
Cal holding the top of the phone to hide the only scratch XD!!!!!!!!
Was it actually Katie who Cal messaged?😂
I love harry’s style
I’m buying the case cuz I saw itachi!
Your content is OP
5:50 Harry’s voice got me😂
Bruh, the fuckin phone cracked in the top right but Freezy covered it with his hand lol 20:13. 23:13 he is showing the phone but covering the cracked bit with his finger
I've had to subscribe to loads of YouTubers just to see Harry😭
I swear Harry is featured in other people's videos more than his own vids
Can already tell this is gonna be a banger lol😂
That text was definitely sent to Katie
cal with makeup is a disgrace
It's mad that this channel only survives because of your friends mate
19:10 Did he just say "the white one", like how dare you. That Itachi case looks B E A U T I F U L
NOW THATS A BANGER OF A VIDEO FREEZY!!!
Is Harry not in a relationship anymore???
oh god he definitely sent that to katie
He looks like pikachu😭
LMAOO THE REACTION TO THE MAKEUP
definitely the text was to katie
This is gonna get VIEWS
Someone's dad right now: 11:26
I bet that person cal sent it to was Katie 100%
Putting the milk in last is the RIGHT Thing to do when making a cup of tea. Any other way is unnatural 😳🤢. It goes in last so you know how much milk you need otherwise you would end up with warm milk

Why does that crackhead appear in everyone else’s videos except his own
Cal looks like the mask
Holy crap I just realized the sidemen mukbang vid was filmed on Harry and Cal's House
It's criminal that this two haven't made a podcast together
Where did calfreezy post that picture I can't find it anywhere
15:00 confirmed Harry is secretly brown
At 14:50 Cals and Harry's citizenship has been revoked
I wish Harry would just tell us where he gets all of his hoodies / jumpers.  Does anyone know where I can buy the one he's wearing in this at the beginning?
14:23 Man i felt really bad for Harry he really felt that one because of the single joke
Cal needs one of those sidemen teeth whitening

Harry may as well be called a collab only youtuber, he’s never on his own channel but always on other channels
Calfreezy with makeup is um interesting to say the least...

Whenever Harry’s in a video it bangs
