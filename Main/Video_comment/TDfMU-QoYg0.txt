A sweet dream? You actually asmring(?) me to sleep. That would be a nice thing personally speaking.  Interesting video though
Sometimes I like❤to review the program ❤more.Thanks.
Not had tingles for months, then I found this. Oh boy, night night 😴
Imagine chillin and someone pulls up and factory resets you
❤️💓💗
One of my go-to videos, i just love her so much. She's amazing.
By far my favorite ASMR roleplay.
I feel like I’m watching a great movie sci-fi 😮❤ I love this surprisingly
mon diue                                                             i dont speak French
Idk y I’m cat sitting  I’m allergic to cats but sure anyone got an epipen
This video is incredible and I’ve watched it several times. You’re very creative and good at what you do❤
How I wish this was real 😩 If it were all my chronic illnesses could just ✨vanish✨
1:14 intro
I think there's a bug in the dream update package cause when I was floating along the lazy river it turned out to be Matawan Creek in 1916.

The first Janet had a click wheel.
Pls do part 4
6:52 oh if only I could control my hyperfixations like this
The second i heard "earth after rain" as a smell option, i immediately perked up. I love that smell and would love to naturally smell like that (or even just own soap that smells like that)
I think some of the clicking sounds are being made by an xbox controller, but it totally works.
Another one that's a little on the weird side. She's good
I wish I could be recalibrated irl
i know a ps4 controller when i hear one lol!
I love these I just watched the other one until I knew most of the triggers thank you for these the mixture of controller and keyboard and mouse buttons are SOOOOOO satisfying
I know you already have two recalibration videos, but could you please make more??
me: trying to listen to asmr to fall asleep    Mr. Beast and his ads: I HAVE A ChalLenGe for YoU!!!!! Go To every ComPuTer in your hOUSE!!!!YOUR MOMS!! YOUR DADS !!!YOUR SISTER!! YOUR BROTHERS!!! anD iNStaLL HONEY!!!!!!
One of of my earliest ASMR experiences in retrospect was that game on Whose Line Is It Anyway? where one person did pantomime and another did sound effects, so I love this!
oh my goodness please do another of these! Even just a short one would be so fun
Moon: "Decreasing stress levels" What I'd give for that to be an option ╭(╯^╰)╮
POV: this is what your game character sees when you customise them in game
This video (and her other recalibration video), are seriously my favorites, not only of hers in general but of all other ASMR artists I've tried. More like this will be enjoyed and appreciated. You pick the best sounds and storylines (and your whispers are so relaxing)!!
I might be crazy but I think her glasses don’t have a lens
A baby
1:15 here’s when the video starts if anyone wanted this ✨🥰
1:15 remember
This video is my favourite and j love it to bits so keep up the good work  Almost at 1mil woooo
The ‘clicking’ sounds, they almost sound like a pro controller is being used. I love the noises, they give me tingles Every Single Time!
This is thee most clever ASMR video I've seen! Very creative, and so well done! Loved every minute of it 😊🙌
Holy cow!!!! A think this was a record amount of tingle for me!!! Great video!!!!
This is a very accurate description of hyperfixation, impulsivity and overall just Neurodivergency to an extent, idk if Erin (and anyone else that has done this) *meant* this to be that way but I'd like to note it
WOOOOOOOOOW! JUST WOW! 🥺🤍🙌🙌
Obviously a great video, also cutest glasses yet I think, I wonder what that style is called, since mine are falling apart.
Imagine releasing a movie when like half the population is set for like low attention span and it bombs
MY CELIA ST. JAMES
miss you goodnight moon
Raycon more like Gaycon
This is my favorite one
Erin putting in what we’re going to smell like while I’m not paying attention: a baby and-  Me: *A what?-*
I hadn't had strong tingles for awhile. Then THIS happened
did she specifically say she was going to choose strawberry blonde for our hair for the mitski reference and her single???
alternative titles: hacker changes your look recalibration with the queen of autumn
I'm obsessed with this video
Why is this reminding me of "Code Lyoko"? I can just sense my inter Aelita Schaeffer to her inter Jeremie/Jeremy Belpois
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO LIKE THIS PLEASE THERE IS NO OTHER VIDEOS LIKE THIS I CAN FIND PLEASE THE TRIGGER IS SO GOOD.
Please do more of this🥺
I love this video, but the one thing that would have made it PERFECTION is if we would have started out at a lower audio, and a blurry vision. That way when you recalibrate or turn up the volume, it would have made us feel more clear headed!
Can I just say, your glasses are to DIE for
I have watched this 10 times and im not tired of it
Wait one of my new dreams is "Penguin at the Vampires lair?"
I feel like a relaxed animatronic lol
I wish this was real :( I suffer from bad allergies around cats and while I can take allergy medication, I often forget a lot. Plus cats are my favorite pet.
ARE YOU USING AN XBOX CONTROLLER LOLOL  Love your videos! I've fallen asleep to so many (I mean this in the best way lolol)
My fave same rn🤌
THIS!!! I've wanted a whole vid of this for ages!!!
ASMR starts at 1:14 for whoever is watching this on repeat:)
I wish I could smell like bonfire and just set my haircolor like that ;w; love the vid! <3
The Ads YouTube have stuck on thiscare insconsiderate.
I love these kinds of asmr but I can never find the right ones, this one was perfect
My school blocked this video so I have to watch it with a vpn I’m so upset
Is it just me, or was one of the fragrances "Lime Curry"?
i like how the background is dark so my phone screen doesnt seem super bright when i’m trying to sleep
I have such an unhealthy addiction to gaming that I can figure out that they’re using an Xbox one controller to make the sounds just by listening to it
I wish some friendly animator would make a digital interface overlay for this. Would be so good.
I’m a little disappointed with myself, I knew what type of controller that was almost immediately just based off the sounds alone
Dear virtual boyfriend diary, she set my hair settings to ginger today. Let's see how she likes it when I change her 'hide the ring in the champagne' setting to 'hide the ring in the virtual baby' setting.
I absolutely love Erin's glasses. The edges of them remind me of Hermes's wings.
i feel like she’s using a gaming controller to make the sounds
i wish it was this easy to just change my hair color 😭
okay. so. I have this metaphor for my brain that I've been using for nearly a decade. bad, negative feelings and intrusive thoughts are Brain Weasels; good thoughts and all other feelings are made by Emotions Mouse; and the part of me that pays attention in therapy and knows all the coping techniques is Logic Rat.  This video feels very Affirmative Of Logic Rat. I love it. <3
I’d like a mix of “earth after rain”, “fabric softener” and “library”, please
I really want to be able to do this IRL. Magically become better at the hobbies I enjoy with minimal effort? Yes please. Plus SO easy to reduce stress and increase energy.
SO WE’RE JUST GONNA IGNORE ERIN IS NOW A CONFIRMED MITSKI FAN🤨
“Let’s heighten your sense of taste”  Yes please! I just had COVID and it’s really not all back yet.
Cyberpunk 2077
her simply saying "earth after rain" almost made me emotional. that is the most calming scent ever to me and it'll be forever until i'll be able to smell it again cause it'll just be snow for months now
me, who has insomnia, when she increased my current sleepiness: “that is not going to help my current situation ma’am. i am exhausted and it’s 5 AM.”
Soooo, it's been a month and gotta say my stress dial has done at least 4 complete revolutions and is sitting at a rather uncomfortable 430%. Please come back and fix this
People trying to do math “in their head”:
Can we all agree that we should all start using ‘big hat no cattle’ and just confuse everyone? Plus if u hear someone else say it u know they watch these videos too😄
1 raycon is 1 dislike
Awesome!!!!!!!
This video makes me very unexplainedly happy
2:50 *gets sonic blasted into another dimension*
Oh I tingled the whole video the clicking of buttons. Phew. And the hand movements.
oh wow this is such an interesting concept with the invisible buttons :0 these gave me so much tingles im rly surprised! kudos to erin for doing such great editing work on the timing of the sounds!!
This has become one of my favorite videos of yours. I keep coming back to rewatch it!
Either this is where babies come from or I'm your replika  This was amazing
Geeze, I gotta upgrade my interface. Sounds like I'm still running on a Mac. And by Mac I mean Macintosh, as in: "If you finish the assignment early, you can play Carmen Sandiego on the Macintosh."
MITSK🙏🙏
Okay, I've been just enjoying/appreciating where this stuff puts me mentally. And it's all kind of fascinating, psychologically.   But this may be the first time I've gotten those tingles people talk about lol. Like, this is mostly just background noise for work or something to fall asleep to, normally. But I'd actually have to be in a state of mind to relax if I want to watch/listen to this video 😅🙏👌
The moment you mentioned mitski i felt extra seen
Me when i get factory settings reset 🦧
i think i already smell fruity , erin .
"She mentioned a fear of being watched by ducks." "Wow, what a quack." "I knew it! Where!?"
Alright let's see if I dream about floating down the lazy river Tonite 😂
The noises in this video are just perfect! 🥰
Thank you for this video 🥰 So many tingles :D
I have watched this multiple times. Super tingly and relaxing
This video makes me feel like I’m in Chobits and I’m here for it
i love this video so much, it gave me SO many tingles
OK but real talk that was fantastic. And we absolutely need one again and a month from this video because that will be right in time to get re-calibrated and updated before all the holiday gatherings. Lord knows a reset either before or after would be 100% needed LOL.
1:14
I don't know why I love this so much but this is my third watch through tonight 10/10 great content
Im strawberry blond!! :)
Youre vids are so unique! Thanks for always thinking outside the box & creating such amazing content!
Raycon doesn't ship to my country 😓
I.. have watched this video more times than I care to admit. I think I may be addicted.
This look is serving me Barbara Gordon/Oracle <3
I would like my hair to grow faster please!
My absolute favorite trigger of all time, and your videos on this are 👌👌 top tier 👌👌 Thank you for this video! I know editing this must've taken so much time 🥺
only thing I can think in the beginning of this is "please don't up the brightness!! I have migraines..."
This might just be my new favourite video. Typing is one of my favourite triggers and that combined with your voice is just chef kiss.
pov: you’re a sentient super computer and your owner is installing your monthly updates
The effort and dedication in your videos is astounding 🦋✨ we appreciate all you do to help us relax/unwind/sleep 😴🪐🌙
Having just gotten over covid, this video couldn’t have come at a more perfect time
do you record the “invisible sounds” first then the video or the video then the sounds?
you just unlocked tingles in places i didn’t even know could tingle
When she increased the tingles meter I could feel tingles up my spine as if she really was increasing some invisible tingles meter 💕😍 really loved this ASMR.
There is a small part of me that hopes she's secretly playing Morgan Stark and she's made a full robot.
I'm about to fall asleep but this is so good I had to leave a comment! I really enjoyed that you let us make our own choices and then left it ambiguous. Also all the different skills to learn sounded super interesting!!! Thanks for all the work you put I to all these vids!
Please do this every month
Her: for now we going to set you the strawberry blonde.. Me: b-but I want the purple 😟
I love the small Mitsuki references far more than I should, this is such a cute video <3
1:15
I’m over here like Xbox or PlayStation controller? 👀
Can you adjust my likeability with women. Get rid of social anxiety would help as well
The editing this video must have required has gotta be just so much, Erin you killed it that you for all the effort you put into all your videos. You're a treasure 💖
"prefer this montfh" 😛
1:14
Your videos are great. Raycons are garbage
I keep coming back to this video!!! It’s just so calming and gives me sm joy
Are you an aspiring foley artist? You're doing an amazing job!
What controllers did you use for this? I think I recognize an xbox one controller and possibly a ps4 controller as well
I love love love invisible triggers paired with fitting, close up hand movements. Great video!
*is watching with my raycons bc the sound quality is so good*
That was amazing!!
Did she really say Mommy at 13:11 or am i not hearing something ?? 😂😂
Moon you are so gorgeous! You give me so much sapphic panic..
This comments section is so so deservedly sweet but nobody is talking about Erin’s invented slang  I’m a big fan of “big hat no cattle”
“Fruity…campfire…a baby…” *me describing my gender*
I hope she is doing okay.
i will give you a trench
I literally use raycon every night to watch your vids lmao
Please turn off post-roll ads, I just dozed off when "DEAR EVAN HANSON" blasted my ear drums 🤣
For some reason I so badly want like an old fashioned candy shop/sodas shop role play where you can tap on the candy and have glass jars and stuff
The fact that you mentioned “Working for the Knife” made this video 10 times better
I feel like the recallibrating is for assistant droids or assistants (Rons Gone Wrong) so for your next vid you should do asmr as the droid that was recently recalibrated to the owner's taste :D
I'm impressed with how well you managed to sync the audio with the video
I love youuuu
BOo! Return to Babblebrook pls this Halloween. T.I.A! 👻♥️🇵🇭
The whisper. Why? I can't
Anime
Youtube added an after video ad nooooo
Hi
So grotesque
#50 on Trending!  Great video!
OMG what a talent. Do you teach private lessons? I've been wanting to make a clicking sound myself but it just takes too much skill and ingenuity😓
This video is trending omg🥺
,,,K
The timing in this video couldn’t be better
#50 on trending!!! 🎉
Omg my ACNH character looks like you with those glasses 😂 it wasn’t intentional but it’s pretty cool 😌
ERIN!!! thanks for a new video love you ❤️‍🔥
Your on the explore page!
Girl, you're on trending!!
Reminds me of Ephemeral Rift's "Repair Man".  My all time favorites!
What?....
Are we robots? I don't get it but I'm sleepy already
I know you’re probably going through a lot right now but thank you for doing these videos and thinking of our well-being. I hope you know that we care about yours as well and i hope you take time to yourself also. We’ll be here❤️
omg she's a mitski fan!!! @ 7:04
Can we talk about how gentle and kind Erin's videos always are? She's so sweet!
"Is there any particular genre of music you'd like to prefer this month?" "Ska." "That will be perfect to enjoy the new Mitski single to its fullest extent." :O
Falls asleep to video.. gets woken up to a loud horror movie ad when the video ends. 😥😢
13:17  _as very ticklish person with constant allergies who had a bad headache today_  _am seen_  ^_^
I figured ut out its a controller
ULTRA TINGLES I haven't felt in a long time!  You are so good at what you do. So beautiful too!  I hope your personal changes are smoothing out and you take time for yourself.
As radiant as ever Erin!! Love the sounds in this vid too. ❤️
Erin this is incredible
From a person who absolutely loves being given unique options to choose from and anything the sorts this was a fantastic video!
If you could turn that patience dial up to like 11, that would be great.
YAYYY I was so hype when I seen this! after the last video I was like I need a full video of recalibrating !!!
This feels like Erin is wishing us well indirectly with these positive settings. Like she’s saying “I hope you have good hair days”, or like when you tell kids “You are so strong” they will really believe that they are strong!
i wish this video was longer ;-;
I don't know if I misheard, but did you reference Mitski's song Strawberry blonde?  Because that is some level 20 taste in music.
Sira couliby
this new style you’re doing has turned my brain into tingly goop and I’m all here for it  I’ve always wondered with the babblebrook series, a queen has been mentioned, will we get a glimpse of her?
Love this video and your work. You’re of the best asmr artist and I absolutely love your work. Just this video seems to have an add at the end. Is there anyway you have control of adds at the end of your video? I listen to it and was relaxing and falling asleep and went it finished a very noisy add came on at the finish and I woke up. Would be nice not be be waken up by adds at the end of video because it’s defeats the purpose of falling asleep.
I wish I knew you in real life, I bet you are so chill that being around you puts people at ease. If you're ever interested in having an Austrian pen pal, let me know :)
This is probably the only advert (at the start) that I could describe as relaxing rather than irritating :P
That was... em... different. 🤔  Can't say I have seen that too often... or ever before come to think of it.
I'm so picky with my Asmrist. Finding the right voice to match my ever shifting moods is quite difficult. But I always enjoy your vids. I think I've rewatched your sculpting video at the very least 30 times. Your voice is quality content!
It bewilders me how the quality of her content is continuously improving. A true master of her craft.
These are so great! I love the recalibrating videos.
It bewilders me how the quality of her content is continuously improving. A true master of her craft.
Please ma'am I would love to smell fruity it will completely the look
this would be a cool monthly series!
this video has an ad at the very end 😭😭
The specific clickity clackity quality of those buttons is magic, then the added visual triggers make this next level 💤💤💤
this video was the reason i found out mitski had released a new single
I love everything about this. You're awesome!
All of us have broken Gods moral law the Ten Commandments we are guilty before God but two thousand years ago God sent his son to die for our sins in a court of law if your guilty and someone pays your fine your free to go that’s why before Jesus died he said it is finished the debt of mankind has been payed for put your trust in the saviour now and repent of your sins.❤️
Love the controller sound
Why is she whispering
Im starting to think that I am a steampunk robot or just something mechanical due to the lack of "boop beep" sounds that i commonly hear when watching "fixing you" asmr vids.
bruh what the f
You ALWAYS make incredible videos and these in particular send my tingles through the roof. Thank you!!!
I wish I had a switch that made my hair grow slower or faster. That sounds dope.
This video was on trending!!
I like ur asmr video it's so satisfying!
This is the first time I've seen a asmr video on trending!
Oh my gosh you’re trendinggggggg!!!!  Love your videos as a whole but this one knocked me out not even twenty minutes in. New record unlocked! 💜💜
I thought you were a 10/10 before but the glasses made you an improper fraction.
Number 45 on trending!!!! Wooooo 🥳
This is incredible! Thank you
I am obsessed with this!!! I have not seen an ASMR roleplay like this
Why tf is this trending tho?? 😂😂
Can we talk about how gentle and kind Erin's videos always are? She's so sweet!
erin: let's heighten your sense of taste me who has sensory processing disorder and already has an extreme sense of taste: *please don't do that*
OMG I love this so much~ Also my cats name is bubbles, I feel so seen XD
👋🏻 *waves*
UR TRENDING!!!
Does Dr T know you’re out here recalibrating his tingle droid army
Those mumbling kinda like semi audible speaking/exam/explanation parts of videos are always my favourite cause it’s so subtle but sooo tingly!!! Loved the vid!!!
This is on trending 😳 congrats erin!!!
Congrats on being on the trending page!
Omg this video is trending!!!  Also becoming one of my new favorite series for sure
"fruity" erin i already Am fruity i dont know if i need to smell like it too
okay so when I was little and I’d be in bed, before I’d go to sleep, I would tap on my forehead like a keypad, put in my “passcode” and then think about what I needed to remember for tomorrow, and then I’d “lock it in” by putting the passcode in again. Idk why but this video reminded me of that LOL   anyone else do anything like this as kids
MITSKI SINGLE MITSKI SINGLEMITSKI SINGLE,…. ERIN YOU HAVE PHENOMENAL MUSIC TASTE
Now I’m envisioning a giant death robot that smells like a baby and I’m…intrigued

Hey you're trending. Good job!
THE NEW MITSKI SINGLE OH MY GOD
This only triggered my misophonia. Thanks a lot.
damn, erin’s on trending. big time mode.
ERIN ON THE TRENDING PAGE YESSSS
Asmr has the opposite effect on me. I become violently angry rather than calm and relaxed. Idk why.
This needs to actually be monthly
Oh my god this is amazinnnnnnnng. You've always been and continue to be one of the most creative minds on here!
I would love to buy the raycon earbuds but they are expensive

loving everything your putting out. Keep up the great work!!
Was this cyberpunk? Solarpunk?? I loved it
First of all you look great absulotly beautiful is that how being a laptop feel like!!! I understand now  Not bad honestly  Keep it up 😙
“ What smell would you like?”  Fruity please  “Yeah that would suit u really well”  🤨
Yes!!!! This type of keyboard sound is my favorite. Coupled with the personal attention, this video has already skyrocketed into one of my top 5 favorite ASMR videos
Amazing! Thank you for the video :D
Great! I'm in love with this video
When you asked for music I said "Mitski" and then you actually replied "okay then the new Mitski single" PLEASE YOU KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
I had a really bad day today and I just feel sad, upset, and over all just overwhelmed but when I saw your video in my notifications box I instantly clicked because I when I listen/watch your videos they make me really happy and calmed from my current or past troubles 😊   So thank you for that 💛
hi have you watched the owl house
#29 on trending!!!
You’re trending yay!!!
Yes I'm a model T-800 and need my monthly adjustments. I told you I would be baaack.
Idk how to compliment girls' hair without feeling like I'm being weird but like... her hair is dope...
when people say it's "that time of the month" they actually just mean the days leading up to their monthly recalibration with moon
Hey Erin, hope that you are doing well!! Thanks for the video!!🧡
3 minutes in and INSANE tingles 😩🥰 so grateful for these videos ❤️
1:16 to skip ad
Damn this girl is GORGEOUS!!!
Your "poppy" mouth sounds are quite nice 🎃
This is amazing, i love it <3
MOAR OF THESE PLEASE
I loveee playing with buttons, so this video was super relaxing
Congrats on trending. Cool video
Listening to the ad while wearing my white E25 raycons that I bought because of this channel...
✔ ASMR
When did Erin become Garrus Vakarian? I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ahaha
I'd like to smell like apples please
omg this is on the trending page!!! I've never seen asmr there!
How is it always so quiet? Like, do you have a special soundproof room installed or do you just live outside the city? BUT, you just got a puppy how is he not barking all the time?
No, I find this to be annoying
Ray on buds are terrible do not buy them. Literally anything else.
ASMR is an acronym for Annoying Smacking Mouth Recording
So good, thank you!
You’re trending!
More soft speaking.
Erin Jaeger 😳
#29 on trending oml
"Big hat, no cattle." 🤣 I LOVE that. Gonna spread it like Covid at a music festival. Should have no problem catching on, especially out here in Wyoming!
erin on trending??? i never thought i would see the day! congrats!
29 on trending? crazy! so proud of you!
You're ASMR videos are amazing. You have helped to changed the ASMR landscape. Please stop peddling raycon garbage. It's below you.
I just watched Stepford Wives and I can’t help but think this is how they turn you into one. LOL.
WTF IS THIS?!?
Is anyone getting ads at the end of Erin’s videos again? So annoying when it’s ASMR
In the future this is where robots will come to relax.
"fruity. New mitski single" I feel like erin is watching me
Your hair color is PERFECT it's exactly the color I wanted but didn't get
Welcome to : the advanced Sims character menu
Does anyone know the color/brand of her hair dye??? It’s the perfect fall red 😍
Not my favorit...the keystrokes gets to me.
Im listening to this in raycon earbuds lmao
I immediately was reminded of Dr. T here, like you were a tingle bottom industries employee!
I love when you list things out, so lovely 🥰 you should do a waiter roleplay and read out menus for a future video!
Would you consider this.. cyberpunk ?
This was soo awesome♡♡ can you do one with computer sounds+ keyboard ?? I loved the tapping keyboard sounds on this one!
"Big hat no cattle."  As someone who lives in Texas, I have never heard this before but instinctively knew what it meant.
Yo, the Foley work is fire in this one.
Thanks Erin !! Xx
A Cat named Bubbles? Is this a trailer Park boys reference?
Amazing, thank you for creating this video.
I listen to ASMR while doing work 😆 love this!!!
My question is: What console controller were you using? Second time through the video for those sweet tingles I realized the combination of joystick and buttons. I swear for parts of this video she"s using a video game controller
lmao @ the random bald asian guy 😂😂
The glasses <3333
When she gave the options of what to smell like, as a bisexual she/they I simply have to go with the ‘fruity’ option 😌
Enjoy your indoor videos, but was wondering if you and Isabelle have any road trip videos planned?
These invisible triggers 🙌🏼
YOU LISTEN TO MITSKI???? OMG
omg Erin I love u and ur videos but 2:51 absolutely startled me 😭 I hope I'm not alone in this (I might be) like it's 4 am & the loud thud/boom made me jump out of bed LOL I thought it was the neighbors on the 2nd floor.  (edit: i still love this video regardless!! it soothed my headache <3)
I an ecstatic! One of my favourite triggers ever by one of my most favourite asmrtists :D
rsrs
Why ad at END? 🥺
Is this my new favorite type of ASMR video? I think yes
I got an ad at the end of this video that woke me up 😭 loved the video though
Lately I've been going through a rough time and haven't been able to sleep well and relax. My university demands that we write a ton of essays with absurdly short deadlines and it's really difficult to find time to switch off my brain and just exist for a while without feeling guilty about not working. But your videos have always reminded me that it's important to rest, so thank you for being here for so many of us and keeping us sane! Truly appreciate it 🖤
Who watched asmr as a joke, before you watch it daily.
love ur glasses
I know it would probably be so much work but imagine seeing this character uploaded once a month for check-ins where she “fixes” the problems and makes us feel better 🥺💗
1:14 is when the sponsor ends
*Goodnight Moon finishes upgrades and recalibrations* "How do you feel?" *Keanu Reeves voice pack activates* "I know Kung Fu."
Petrichor please.
irl character creation I’m living for this!
Super needed. Thanks........ ❤
Either she’s making the typing sounds with the offscreen hand or the post-editing on this video was excruciating.
OMG YESSSS!! I loved when you did this at beginning of the invisible triggers so I love that there’s a full 18 minutes of this!
_You are my favorite_
Thank you for another wonderful video, Erin, and for all that you do, always!  I wish you all the warmth, relaxation, peace, and comfort that you so selflessly provide for others! Have a lovely week!
I’m sorry but why the hell isn’t this woman making Halloween videos???? Isn’t she the Halloween fanatic?
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Erin: what would you like to smell like this month? Me being sleep deprived: uhh... Cheese and onion crisps!!
Oh this is such a cool idea! I clicked onto the video not expecting to hear the sounds like that, that's so creative! : D
The guy I’ve been interested in lately jokingly refers to me as a android so this video came in my recs at the perfect time 😅☺️
wow this must've been a crazy amount of work! Good video!!
Do you enjoy pushing my buttons... because I do.
LOVE the mitski mention! 😄
Serious thought: I love this as a mental exercise, to remind ourselves that if we want to change, sometimes all we have to do is give ourselves permission to do so and act accordingly, like we changed our settings.  Funny thought: “See you next month at your next calibration.” Well, now I have it in my calendar and will be expecting you, Android Manager Erin. 🙂
I know that was a lot of editing audio to match up with those fingers lol kudos
This is both clever and mesmerizing in a sleep-inducing way. Tapping videos annoy the geebeezus out of me, but this is delightful.
9:03 I know a console controller when I hear one, lol. Love the video :D
I wasn't paying attention and then I heard "the new Mistki single" and immediately got excited haha
I'm just addicted by your voice and how you mix delicate whispers, to deeper and more close up ones. 😍
We are simply robots in the lab of a student at San Fransokyo Institute of Technology and I love it
hi
Man this was awesome
She accidentally just made the best cyberpunk 2077 roleplay I've ever seen
This was so unique! I love this
NOT THE NEW MITSKI SINGLE
Garrus Vakarian loves this video
Ah, I see what you did there…strawberry blond hair color & then mentioning Mitski 😉
Those glasses are on point.
Erin gettin her ripper doc vibes on, over here recalibrating our augments
00110011000 <Thanks for the Recalibrating  I was feeling a little tense , this made things a lot better my AI was going bonkers .. thanks so much. :P > 0011100011111011
DO U HAVE AN INSTA
Super tingly and super relaxing, love this style of invisible triggers video.  Also, I'm not sure if I'm feeling existentially terrified because this is a post-Singularity android POV, or existentially hopeful because this is a post-mortality cyborg POV (though if typical sci-fi is anything to go by maybe that scenario isn't all that hopeful either)... I guess what I'm saying is this pov is existentially confusing and also I should rewatch Altered Carbon.  Edit: after getting deeper into the video, Westworld is a much better comparison, which both deepens the existential confusion, and is also another show that I now need to rewatch.
Sorry I can't listen to the ad I'm busy untangling my head phones
i’m gonna re-watch this on december 1st and all my answers are gonna be christmas related. i wanna smell like christmas trees, with silver hair and an intense love for christmas music
pov you are a computer or something
7:01 As if I wasn't excited about the new Mitski single already!
Love this! This put me in such a good mood, I can't believe you thought about adding switches for good hair days, more patience etc! The creativity!! ✨
cant wait to listen to that mitski single at its full capacity!
Loved this one! The variety of clicks synchronized with the hand gestures was mesmerizing. I wish I could get these adjustments in real life :')
It bewilders me how the quality of her content is continuously improving. A true master of her craft.
Its always sponsor by😩
Erin you should try playing legends of runeterra ^^ if you like card games, it's been one of my favs. Loved the video, I'm sure I'll watch it 50 times+
Hell yeah 😎 super relaxing video. Love the invisible clicking
I just wanna say i hope you're doing okay  Take your time to heal, don't rush yourself to make videos, we can understand if you need more time
man, some day im gonna buy some raycons lol they've sponsored more good nights sleep than sleepnumber
Thank you for these videos 🖤
The fact that Erin talked about the new Mitski song!&@$%  Perfection
Erin, you are such an inspiration! Your creativity and energy is infectious, and I love when you post new vids, it’s like hanging out with a friend. I rewatch a lot of your stuff and it helps me get on with my day. (Ps you don’t know it but we’ve been friends for quite a few years now so thanks for being there for me: I’m here for you as much as a viewer can be!) Thank you for all you do! Love and hugs from UK 🤗 💕
I feel thoroughly recalibrated
"That'll be perfect for Mitski" ah, you've read my like a book 🏳️‍🌈
Loooooved this, definitely going to become a frequent rewatch
This but in a Matrix style role play video. I suddenly thought about that and I think it'd be a cool thing to do.
erin: what do u wanna smell like this month? me: vanilla! erin: we did vanilla this month
I’m obsessed. Best ASMR video !
Where’s Marno
i wanna smell like a new car are you kidding
I love the whisper voice you use in the sponsored ads and I hope you would do more videos with that voice☺️ also more unintelligible whispering/mouth sounds would be awesome💚🥰
Erin really has the best ideas for asmr!
Notification: Goodnight moon has uploaded! Me: *checks time* 3:12pm  Welp gotta go to sleep now
Why do I know what a Library smells like
When I fall asleep do I make the widows shut down sound?
Hey, Erin, thanks for putting up so much content for us!  Jesse Gibson (the singer guy I'm hoping you'll collab with) has been posting a lot lately, too, I feel spoiled with you both posting so many vids (and on the same days, mostly, too!) 🥰 I think you'd like this song he posted recently, called "Punkin", its super adorable, and totally your vibe He's got a lot of other Halloween songs up now, but "Punkin is just a sweet lil love song that kinda talks about harvest stuff instead of Halloween 🎃,  I think you'd like it Maybe you could use some of his songs in you're vids, or maybe you could work with him and be in some of his vids? 🤔🤞 Jesse does original stuff, like "Softly" and Punkin" and he does a lot of old-timey stuff, too As an artist I think he fits your vibe nicely, so I'm sure you two would get along and make some magical content for us all to enjoy 😁😉  Hope you two can make it happen soon 🙏 🤞
this 100%  has the energy of a caramel fall candle
I love the video. So relaxing and soothing
“What do you want to smell like this month? Whisper babble, Tropical, whisper babble, laundry detergent, whisper babble, *A BABY* -“  Not baby powder, but a literal baby. That just made me laugh haha
I JUST CAN NEVER GET OVER YOUR HAIR???!! SO FANTASTIC AND JFDSFJDSKLJF JUST LUV
Yesssssss. This is amazingggg. Definitely going to want more of these!!!
Where is marno
She’s so beautiful wth!
"Pushing your buttons"
glad to see you enjoyed working for the knife as well!! overjoyed that mitski's back <33 amazing video as usual btw :)
This is great!
Petrichor is the name for the smell of the earth after it rains. 🌎 🌦
MITSKI TEASE???!
I didn't have a fear of being watched by ducks _before_
Erin: Does short calibrating trigger in an assortment  Fans: Would love that trigger as a video Erin: Posts it not even a month later  This is why ur the best <3
알람설정 켜둔 몇안되는 에쎔알 채널이에요. 역시 이번것도 너무 좋아요 :) 빨간머리 넘 가을에 찰떡이고 색감도 좋고 거슬리는소리도 없고... 최고이시다
So creative!
I wish we could talk on heroes not this to you but like different YouTubers or something not directly but like something like like notes or something like not literally like like comments my back hurts and forwards Florida YouTube video or something that I think of something that I'm like wanted that YouTuber think
Was literally watching your invisible triggers video last night and was hoping you’d make something like this again, thank you!!
Hi. Is there some other way we can support you so you no longer need sponsored videos?
I've been struggling more than usual to sleep this week so this is just what I needed, ty so much!,
Side rant but judging by the buttons and the fact that we have "settings" surely means that we are a robot. But we obviously have the ability tot think for ourselvs because moon asked "what would you like to smell like this month?" and other questions. So my thing is, would'nt it be horible to live and be aware that our interests are all just something we downloaded and might not actually be something we truley love and are interested in. Sorry for the rant lol.
Any chance of us getting an Aerith rp from you? Asking for a friend, literally. She's rly into the FFVII remake, and absolutely _loves_ Aerith, an I think you'd *kill it* as Aerith!
I'm not even going to mention the word "petrichor."  ;-)
hi i love your videos xx
Xbox 360 controller or PS4 controller
1:15 :)
who couldve predicted that actually knowing what anatidaephobia means would ever come up
No "Old Spice" scent? Hummm time for retro upgrades. I could use some guitar updates...please Give some Ear scratches and pay the "Tookie tax" to the puppers, Lord Bless You Erin.🕊🤓🙏❤
Sometimes the click sounds remind me of someone tapping differents buttons on a gamecube controller
POV: You’re a match after the end of Perfect Match from the choices app getting your routine calibration at Ero’s new robotics center run by Gertrude Washington herself.
mitski fan confirmed!!! I always knew you had taste 🤌🏼
gonna head out on the town smelling like a baby B)
perfect for a no bones day
Do you record the video or the sound first I must know
"what do you want to smell like this month?" "fruity!!" "yea, i think that will suit you really well.." LOL🏳️‍🌈
your hair is growing back so fast! not that i’m too surprised, since it is so clearly related to your magical powers.
I’d really love to see some asmr gameplays from you. You’re incredibly calming and have a peaceful vibe so I’m sure it would be super relaxing to watch.
I need all of these upgrades too please.
Thanks :)
Yes. Fix me :3
Erin likes Mitski, based
T E C H N I C A L
I chose fruity bc I am fruity
I LOVE my raycons!!  Use them at bedtime each night for asmr, and used them while getting a root canal this morning 🥺♥️
These new vids are fantastic, the concept is new and relaxing. Just don't leave the babblebrook saga behind, if possible.
this is going in my top ten asmr videos of all time playlist
definitely needed this tonight oh my gosh. 🖤
Really enjoyed this one! :) Thx! 😴
you’re always beautiful of course but recently you’ve been looking extra stunning!! i hope everything’s been going well with you :’)
oooo a dog. so cute! whats his name?
Love the video, thanks and keep up the good work
this made my brain go brrr
I liked your video,  it was very calm and soothing, love the whispers,  it was very relaxing,  thank you.
I haven't watched it all the way through yet, and I wouldn't put it past you to have already done it, but you know what would be a cool sound effect to add to the next one? An old school rotary telephone dial! 😁
Erin. These invisible objects with a sound videos give me the deep tingles I feel in my forehead back to spine. Keep up the good work!
Beautifully done.  So much variety.  Thank you for this.
she be coding us like robots (in all seriousness, this is an amazing video)
I swear, every night that you release a new video, I sleep better than any other night 😊
Took maybe 10 seconds for me to get SO MANY tingles. 2 minutes in and I already live this video.
Erin, thank you again. This is SO tingly. The timing couldn’t be better!
Thank you for the comfort
Oh so Erin wanted us to TINGLE tingle tonight
w
This video is a manifestation of everything I needed tonight!!
This concept is so cool! And i looove your glasses. Ty💖
OMG, Just in time! 🧡
Bob vance, vance refrigeration 🤝
Her hair looks like she cut it to layers and redyed it💖
I ADORE this! 🖤🦇 Fantastic job syncing the video and audio, this was stellar! I hope you're doing well, you're not alone 🖤
MORE LIKE THESE PLEASE!!!!!! Looooooooove ❤️
I adore your makeup and those cute golden glasses!! This is a wonderful and relaxing video, I wish I could be recalibrated like this! 🖤
Erin i love your videos but i dont know why some of the videos (like this one) has Mono audio? it kinda puts off my tingles when I expect sounds to be directional. Your visual triggers are the absolute best tho 😊
What I need after watching a horror movie😂
Send me back to the factory for refurbishment because I’m malfunctioning. 🖤
Makes me think you're a shallow person
I'm not as fond as you as I used to be goodnight moon because you never like or comment on any of my comments! And I'm always nice. I'm considering unsubbing
Last night I was Not-Cow/Bag of Flesh. Now, I am... a human fidget cube robot?
Thank you, I was overdue for a recalibration.
Is that a Nintendo Switch pro controller I hear?! XD I love these button sounds and joystick clicking. Oh! But that sounds like a soft keyboard too. Whatever they are, it means another video with my favorite trigger - hand movements.
I’m a simple man. I see “Goodnight Moon” on my feed, I immediately click on it and prepare for a peaceful slumber.
Just here to say that Raycon earbuds are the flattest/lowest-profile earbuds I’ve ever owned and are a DREAM for side-sleepers!
Just got in bed and pulled up YT. Could not be more stoked to find a new video from you, Erin! Perfect.
7:02 THE NEW MITSKI SINGLE! YESS
@2:41 id know that playstation controller sound from anywhere!
I cannot get over the videos you post, I just recently started listening to your videos and I SWEAR by them. Puts me to sleep everytime, I cannot thank you enough!
Your glasses are 😍
I want to smell like a dragon egg from Maybel's and would prefer to stay deactivated here in the shop until an update adds that option.
Hello hi 👋
I choose to smell like a baby. It’s been a while.
THE QUEEN LISTENS TO MITSKI???
Feels like I'm a Sim! I love it.
it wasn’t my bed time but it is now ❤️
have you tried turning it off and turning it back on?
you have easily become my favorite asmrist! The whispering, ambience, its just perfect for me!
I LOVE MY VISITS TO THE STEPFORD SALON " FOR THE WIVES * ? . I AM confused about things. I'm being silly. I have this feeling that I was something else. .? . Love you from Slave Amy Petherbridge. ps : I Love your work and the time you put into it. Ok. Thank you.
How the heck does this woman ALWAYS HAVE AMAZING HAIR?
To recalibrate, I just lay on my back like a Wii controller and hope the sensor recognizes me
POV: You're the rpg character.
Erin booped my nose 🥺🥺🥺
I feel like I’m a sim and you’re typing the cheats on your keyboard
However many times erin dyes her hair, it still manages to look voluminous and alive
Hello :)
I'm so picky with my Asmrist. Finding the right voice to match my ever shifting moods is quite difficult. But I always enjoy your vids. I think I've rewatched your sculpting video at the very least 30 times. Your voice is quality content!
My hair is actually strawberry blonde. It worked. 😂
Beautiful person ✅ Beautiful video ✅
I love you
I love how you are almost designing yourself
<3
I'm in love with this "interacting with invisible objects" thing that you've started doing. The effort you put in for syncing the sound effects is just awesome.
Me chossing my new interests, hobbies, and appearance every time I feel like I've hit rock bottom:
The days you upload a new video are the best! You have the perfect voice for ASMR. Your videos never fail, always perfect.
Dear Erin, it's definitely ✨the hair ✨ for you.
Daaaaang I am driving... Not gooood.
I bought new bodywash today and dyed my hair so this is actually accurate aha  The clicking is sooooo soothing
👌
such a fox
You've done it again Moon another INCREDIBLE video thank you for all you do Moon❤
This video has a "bring yourself back online dolores" vibe, don't you think?
Yay, a new vid!
Ohh Love the clicking sounds. ❤
1:14 yass
Omg hello you posted
endlessly thankful for you not only putting my actual hair color but also getting my exact taste in music too. Working For The Knife has a chokehold on me
The synchronization is amazing!
I must admit, this is very clever and unique. A good combination of sounds!
wow...This is nice :]
Erin, just your presence on my screen alone brings me such peace. The very second I click on your videos my body begins to feel less tense.   _You’re such a blessing to so many people_
it might be a no bones day, but this made everything so much better
Im only in the raycon ad yet I know I’m gonna love this video   Also we need an update on our bablebrook adventure!!!
just as i was getting ready to go to sleep! perfect timing
Solid! ♥️
early! love you Erin!
Early!! Every video of yours is super satisfying! <3
Wonderfully creative as always! Adore the glasses 🥰
I've been with this channel for 3 years, and it's still crazy to me how I come to every notification that drops, thanks moon.
I’d love to be a kitchen appliance, no thoughts just buttons 👾
what hair color do you use when it is orange blonde ??
Thank God, i was about to rewatch the Valley Girl series for the hundredth time
Been slowing down... Definitely in need of a defrag!
Oh right in time for bed, you couldn't have timed this better!
It's 4am, I can't sleep and I have an 8am lecture tomorrow, so I think the timing couldn't have been better :P Thank you so much for another wonderful and super relaxing video, Erin! ❤️❤️
How do you get your hair to look soooo lovely ❤️
the thumbnail alone looks relaxing already :-D
YESSSSS. YESSSSS… YESSSSS
Aaaaaahhhhh so many tingles YOU NEED TO POST 2 TIMES A WEEK😁😁😁
So pumped to get to fall asleep to this tonight 😍😴
This video is literally perfect. I absolutely love your channel! 🍂🍄🧸
You certainly know how to push our buttons 😅
Another good video, as always😌👌🏽
Can we talk about how gentle and kind Erin's videos always are? She's so sweet!
Thank you for always making my day with your videos!
This was perfect timing
When Erin uploads a new video, I instantly click. And so far I absolutely love the typing sounds.🎃🎃🎃🍁🍁🍁👻👻👻
Honestly I prefer real sounds, I can't watch overlayed sounds, they make me feel dissociated and strange. But the concept is cool! Hope you all have a lovely time 💗
That was nice this helped me sleep
If I’m a machine, I run on Windows 95.
WKDBNFOSNRNSIGD YESSSS YOUR UPLOADS MAKE ME CELEBRATE
hai erin!! luv ur videos💖💖💖 omg im so early...
These “recalibrating” type of ASMR videos are literally treasures. I hardly get tingles anymore but this specific “genre” of ASMR vids makes me relax/tingle everytime
just in time to keep procrastinating my homework with a nap, I love it ❤️✨
yessir lets get it
I don’t know why this is my favorite trigger but it is.
So good... thank you 😴
Beautiful timing! I was just looking for an ASMR video to watch while finishing up one of my midterm assignments! This is absolutely perfect! 😍
Aaaaa just in time for bed ty!! <33 hope you're ok!
On my birthday!? Thank you so much, Erin!😎
i was just watching a goodnight moon video when this posted
I’ve just discovered my favorite trigger!! 🥰
