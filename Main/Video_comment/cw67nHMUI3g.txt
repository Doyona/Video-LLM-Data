😂😂😂 reaves 22 min 0 pt and say Russ is the problem, now lakers trade Russ , and still got 🧹 swept and lakers now trying give reaves 100 million contracts
LeBron didn't mind to tip the ball...
Russell Westbrook added 19 PTS and 7 REB and gets one free throw in the replays 🤨😅
Refs always trying to make the game close when lakers are about to get blown out lol
Let's go Lakers
Aye I really need sum encouragement cuz I'm starting to wonder like what's the point of watching basketball or even playing the games? Doesn't it make you wanna just play in the league but in reality most of us never will
solid ..lbj fans
Imagine LeBron back home with that younger hungry better defensive team with three athletic 7 footers and one that's the hands down rookie of the year. LeBron would guarantee himself final appearances from now til he retired. LeBron get out of that senior citizens home and go home
Poor ariza,🥲
They attack the offense against buddy ,
LeBron... is the true King.
I think Westbrook’s teammates needs to help him out when he collapses the defense. He’s a willing passer, so when he drives trail him because he’ll find you, dunk it or miss and at that point a trailer will have a 50% chance of a putback.
LBJ not jumping in jump Ball
Anyone knows the name of that song @ 05:25 ?
Holy shit... why is this Sacramento team only play great against the lakers.  That makes no sense to me
Is Ight Ariza you gone bounce back better Fam

Lakers win ,without David! Cocach if set with David if magic involved  Everything will work out!
That’s how you win. Take Russ out at closing time when he playin like dat, and put him back in to shoot a couple free throws at the end 🤣😂😂
La☀️
Takes a special kind of confidence to follow not even jumping for the tip-off up with a performance like that. Bron ain't as graceful and smooth as Jordan and Kobe were, but no less the King. It's like watching Wilt, but with handles and a decent shot. Ageless freak of nature
Monk puttin on for Arkansas! We see you boi
Lakers are so bad people celebrate when they beat teams nobody cares about because they are not in contention.  Let them beat some actually decent teams before pll start giving lebron some kind of praise
THT was HOOPING. Good to see him back to form
More Dwight, less THT, scratch that, no THT.
I love how malik always shows out against the kings & former college teammate D’Fox !
4:10..I'm sorry, may I see that again please?😂🙌🏼
The shipping starter ha
Lakers needs a good coach. They won't win a title with this coach
That carmelo foot shuffle all you need to open your self for a shot
Is it just me or these HIGHLIGHTS giving a deja vu :O
Take heart Wesbrook,the Lakers brought in Steve Nash and wouldn't let him do what he was good at, what he was famous for. Lakers are making the same mistake again.
If the lakers keep playing like this, I believe at best they could be 3rd or 4th seed
0 for 16?!
The Lakers are so sad to watch. They have a that talent but no team. At least other teams don't have to buy they're titles. Smh
they was holding monk back in charlotte man he’s really going dummy for the lakers now -suns fan
Lebronto activated
Lakers still trash 🗑 lebron has to work that hard
That's old school Bronx
Lakers so dope with melo Russ and Dwight
I SEE HE CHANGED JERSEYS NUMBER 23 TO 6
Lebron Center for the win
THT is NEVER a good shooter.  I still think he's overrated.
Why does Every Lakers game Almost give me a Heart attack
I’m glad Howard getting mins they need to keep playing him
LBJ lang malakas....
I'm really liking Malik Monk. The Kids has got some Grit for sure. 💪
Lebron starts being agro team plays well
Gaykers got lucky and will be another first round exit at best!
JORDAN IS THE NEXT LEBRON
Lakers as a team need to move the basketball more. “Pass”
See what happens when Dwight Howard plays. Jesus smh. Finally they the big man play
why is there no call on howard steppin oa inbound play 5:43
2:00 Traveling
0:42 Riveting highlight
Westbrook is the best player 😜😂
Jesus Christ died for our sins, was buried, and resurrected on the third day according to the scriptures. (1 Corinthians 15: 1-4)
4:58-5:00 charge???
That’s what I’m talking about Love It!!! Way to take over Lebron he’s one of the greatest finishers in the history of basketball they stop him going to the hole with the game on the line…. The team getting more easy points for guys getting screens making teams work on defense I see you coach….
7:45 Let's just take a moment to appreciate the synchronicity, the basketball God's didn't hesitate on this one! #MadeOfMonk
Let’s go lakers
Monk is more than a shooter...Lakers need to make him second option after Bron
it’s super hilarious when people judge nba teams and are actually so shit on the court, can’t even finish a clean layup… by layup I mean in an actual competitive game (for smartasses who think layups are easy) 😂😂😂
King LBJ, cant forget about Shaolin Monk! Overall good team win
Kings can't beat The King
See Malik Monk had the right idea. Feed the big the ball on offense so he stays engaged on defense where u really need him. Dwight Howard was more engaged this game than he has been in most of his other games he played this year and I believe it’s because of the lobs Malik was throwing him. It’s a simple action that shouldn’t have taken a guy who’s not necessarily one of their primary playmakers to figure out.
G.O.A.T LeBron James,  Chris Jackson, Magic Johnson.  Eternal blessings to the immortal and incomparable Sir Ross Browner, the greatest defensive player in College Football History and greatest student athlete in Notre Dame History.
1:16 we are at the point where Russ lowlights are now highlights
The NBA sucks Chinese rooster!
Lakers win against the bottom feeders? And then every Lakers fan celebrating like heck like they already won this year’s championship? Im outta here
Where’s Wayne Ellington
Put melo in the starting line up
LAKERS WASTED LANCE STEPHENSON......A LOT OF FANS WANTED HIM BUT LAKERS MANAGEMENT DONT LISTEN....THERE DUMB AND DONT DO ANYTHING...THEY ARE REALLY SUPER DUMB.......IF LAKERS DO GET LANCE ITS A BIG HELP FOR THEM BECAUSE HE IS HUNGRY TO COME BACK AND NOW LANCE IS DOING EVERYTHING IN INDIANA PACER.....HE IS DOING REALLY WELL

The Lakers are the most Dangerous  Team in the NBA, when they are Having fun.  ! Watch out,  they're  Coming together.  The bench are Having fun.  Lead on Mr. James. Make sure everyone on the team Is having fun.  No stretch; let have Some fun!...
Every Lakers game for the exception of maybe 2 wins is a freakin nightmare of missed layups and offensive struggles.. Nothing comes easy for this team which is amazing when you consider the Lakers have LBJ, AD, Melo and Westbrook.. How can a team with that much talent have so much trouble scoring..?? I can understand the defensive ineptness and lapses, but there's just no understanding how this team struggles to score, and I'm not even talking about three's, I'm talking simple layups and mid-range shots..
They still suck.
This was def a great win by them it’ll make them have much more chemistry together ☝🏾💛💜
LeBron James uncle #unclejames
How many bad teams in a row do the Lakers play?🤣🤣🤣
I just wanna point of the fact that Dwight had a double double. But, of course, nobody wants to bring that up. 😅
The Lazy LeBron..
LeMVP Legoat lekidfromakron
Los Angeles Lakers Win Playing of the game Lebron James
3:33 James slam dunk lakers lbj for three 8:08
lA is back🤭🤗
I love bazemore presents of the bench
Yay Kyrie Irving BACK!
Trade tht to desmond bane. They will sure win a championship
i will say it again, let lbj play pg, do not play him with wb its a recipe for disaster
So anyone who watched the Kentucky team with Fox, Bam, and Monk knew they would all be killers, but Monk set the damn freshmen record for most points scored with like 50 something against UNC back in the day. So to see him succeeding in the yellow and purple is so awesome and reassuring, knew he was a baller in Charlotte too. He did deserve those slaps to the back of the head from MJ though lol
Dwight needs to play more minutes. Every time he's in the game he's adding to their lead or keeping it. When he's out the King's come back. Dwight is a game changer on defense. Stop making it hard just play him more
I’m not saying there was a high chance of the kings coming back, but the chance really got slaughtered at the end with that stupid fucking call on the kings. Really just bad officiating.

It's all about the Bulls this season
Lakers are wack
Is it to soon to say lakers turning it around ? I don’t trust this team 💀
Lebron james is way better than MJ lol 😆 😂 🤷 🤣 😴
4:58 like honestly that was no cinematic drama, bro actually fouled and got a no call for it. Ref should be fined and peer reviewed for bad calls not once but many even though Lakers won, we all know bad calls from refs take away from hard work individual put forth on both teams to have a shady ass ref make stupid calls especially at 4:58 the coach even jumped up in disbelief like what more than being fouled do people need to do in order to get that call
I bet on the Lakers moneyline I’m shocked they won I thought it was over when the kings kept draining 3’s in the 4th but the Lakers somehow answered.
Continue to let monk bring it down… seem like when Russ ain’t bringing it down and not controlling the offense.. everyone play better 💯
Le goat 🐐 🙌 👌 😍
They scored on melo like 10 possessions in a row lol
Man if the Lakers had 🦊 or can get 🦊 that would be blockbuster!!!!!!
2,000 comments and I didn't see one about the Kings...that says it all
Lebron's the only player I've seen that can dominate in all positions he played.
Every time I see labrons face on the thumb nail I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he not really in a great mood about the season
I'm a huge Westbrook fan and always will be, but they need to let him go and pay Malik Monk.
Does Tevor Ariza ever touch the ball?
KEEP GRINDING!!!..🔒 in on DEFENSE...PU💜RPLE n G💛LD NAT1ON...
LeBron been playin real good as of late. League gotta look out if he can get his teammates to step up
i love you lebron james Aka Best player in the World - Raiah14
@NBA needs a new YouTube editor
Man fox be killin me. How you gonna throw away the ball on one possession and then not grab the rebound resulting in a jump ball the next? 😡
Y'all make too much money to post this sloppy highlight video
L.A First Five got a Blocks nice Game LA
https://youtu.be/GoHdyRspYR8 ain’t nobody hear this shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Malik Monk looks like he’s gonna be very special if he keeps playing like this
Bro Lebron funny af for not even attempting the tip 😂😂
Great game for Lebron and company! Two great teams with similar aspirations. We probably will meet up with the Kings in the Western Conference  Finals.
Laker's bench has no energy
just another day being a kings fan🙃
Hype over Lakers beating Kings? Come on!
De Aaron Foxx is the reason why I'm proud of supporting Sacramento Kings. If you pay attention to that pace he set for himself not  1 single Los Angeles Laker had a solution.  Technically it's like an everyday type of  mindset. Round of applause👏 DeAaron,  and Alex Len you are a strong center  everytime we rely on someone to  move well without the basketball.  The way Len sets a hard physical screen  is really a bonus because it can free open  some of our best shooters like Tyrese and Buddy Hield. Let's not forget the importance   of enough space 👀either. Woo woo woo🏀
The Lakers should be great in the playoffs
This game last night was highly effective  by both the Kings and Lakers offensively.  If Sacramento played better defense, their  chances of winning at Staples Center would of been very likely. LeBron James 💪is too good no matter what a defense tries to do though. Anytime Melo and Russ are on court these guys give a 100% effort of true performance. I think one of main reasons why Sacramento got exposed towards end is because to many LA team members continued to stay hot. Horton Tucker💪 and Malik Monk🔥 really had their way against us Kings.Got to give my respect for Davion Mitchell 🙌and Harrison ⭐Barnes. It seems like everytime they are inserted into game,  their overall energy just goes straight to  mountain top. Saying this because it's good  whenever an organization is seeking balance. Not only does his approach allow others to succeed but having a dude like Barnes matters even while stopping other opponent. Way to fight and bring us back  some outstanding memories, good and bad. Victory well earned Laker fans.🙂
looking good without ad.
What's up with all this slander on my fav player westbrook?? Without him Lakers wouldnt win any games stop following the media n actually watch the games
Congratulations my babies. I Love u all. 🙌👍❤️
Yeah fvcking let monk play
When lebron is this aggressive they have a good chance of winning
When you realize Monk paid 1.7M only and Westbrook 44M per year
Dwight Should be a starter honestly. 🤷🏾‍♂️
tip off lebron hahahaha
LeGoat!
Lakers must be tired for all this close game that their closing, they really have no easy blowout games this season so far
The lakers biggest let down isn't really Westbrook... It's A.Davis!  He's out every year and when he's in, he's not doing "chit."  C.A. is a better post up player than A.Davis...that's a "d'ham" shame.  Lakers don't have enough players flying to the basket like LeBron because they're all too old.  LeBron takes super care of his body, which is why he can still move some but the rest are like turtles.  Westbrook never stood under the rim in his younger days...  When he went in, he always got airborn for either a throw-down (most of the time) or a layup.  Seeing him now standing under the basket like that trying to fake it in....  Retire, bruh...
Milwaukee Bucks repeat as 🏆
Man get a new editor please missing a handful of l8 4th buckets
kings at lakers what
Howard and Malik are exactly what they’ve needed. Both sensational last night.
Lebron averaging 29, 7, and 7 on 52% shooting at age 37 is absolutely incredible. His numbers are basically identical to his production 10 years ago which is crazy to think about.
I wondered how much longer the Lakers planned on letting Howard ride the bench KNOWING he's a rebounding machine. Seen it too many games here lately.
Cut Deandre Jordan and bring in another defensive big/ forward from the g-League or sign someone that can spell Dwight! Trading Rajon and keeping Stanley was huge. Now all The Lakers need is Kendrick Nunn to contribute. And the Lakers will be back respectable, not great but entertaining.
Lakers can score so much easier if players cut to the basket. Standing around the arc every play waiting for a catch and shoot that Lebron’s will pass them only for them to miss doesn’t have to be the play 70% of the time. Make the defense work,move,talk more than on a pick and roll
Lebron is timeless and honestly is one of the greatest. Age is an excuse for people beyond sports. You age in the mind before the body
0 turn overs from Russ won them this game.
Qualifications to become a video editor for the NBA:        the end
LeBron is straight BALLIN'!! Too bad the Lakers will probably miss the playoffs.
I’ll take Monk over KCP and Kuzma
Go Lakers
The Lakers win without AD, that's a fact. Time to trade him for more robust and helpful players.
Way to hold it together fam! Props to Sac Town though man they played for sure
Imagine starting LeBron at center when you already have Dwight sitting on the bench. Swear they try so hard to make him look good
I noticed the last three games, Westbrook hasn't been launching up a bunch of bad shots or turning over the ball.
Signing Malik monk was better than signing Westbrook.
bro kings fire
Lakers get calls changed for them Kings get calls changed for the Lakers
And there are haters out there who can actually say lebron is trash with a straight face...
3 Straight W 👏 let's go lakernation 💛
Thanks you super man
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSBiBZTRdPCxEjVk60MiWTQ
Lebron learning from mj. Pace yourself the first 3 quarters and in the 4th impose your will and dominate the game.
Lebron should be bald. Period.
LeBron captures his 5th ring come this June.
Lebron you better make sure malik gets that contract after this season
Malik Monk is fearless ❤️‍🔥
Kings deserve to lose this game
It’s funny how the East is dominant now but when Lebron was over there the West was dominant . The NBA fucking rigged or mfs be straight running from Lebron bro straight up ! 😂😂
I don’t get to watch these games I wna know if Lebron has been making his free throws? Like that last AND1…
Monk looked really good on offense and really bad on defense.
They need to trade AD
King james! Go lakers.
I ain’t seen that move from Malik before 🤔
Oh wow Lebald james and los Angeles losers beat Sacramento big whoop lmao so they won against a worse team then them just barely! Not impressed yet happy to see they struggle against worse teams lol
I’m loving what Malik been doing I fucked wit him so hard coming out of college but he wasnt really saucing shut like I know he can, now look at him !
They should turn rus into a defensive point guard I don’t even care that he score anymore
I immediately knew monk was a great signing for the lakers, but I didn’t know his role would have to be the 2nd option at this point
Lebron is da king
LeDoingItAll
We can barely beat the sh*t teams.
lakers fans relax...its the kings  this should not have felt like a game 7 playoff game..
Hate to keep sounding like a broken record but they should’ve kept ball and Caruso it no chemistry with this team at. It looks like they’re playing damn street ball. 🤦🏽‍♂️
LAKESHOW!!!!!! #LEGOATJAMES
lebron=goat
nice ref.
Ariza always look like he on a treadmill movin in slo mo
I'M  MOTHAF*KING PROBLEM
Look how easily the kings stayed in the game. It’s over for the Lakers. They had a nice run.
west brook brings so much energy to the game the lakers needed this win but can they get by 76ers or the worriors or suns or nets
Kings should've kept Kyle Guy
where the Lebron haters at now
Will getting AD back in the lineup help the Lakers?  His lack of effort and unwillingness to take on opposing big men is gonna be the difference in how they do moving forward.
The Los Angeles Lakers are 20-19🟣🟡 they won 4 of their last 5 games
"THE WIZARD" at THE CAGE!! https://youtube.com/shorts/cAvF2BLAUog?feature=share
So LeBron only plays in the fourth quarter he doesn’t wear a headband and he’s balding every single play he’s bad
They need to keep Dwight and Monk on the Floor
Wow. They beat the kings. 2022 Champs. JUST STOP THE SEASON. ITS OVER.
Melo seems like he’s having a resurgence. Definitely our most important addition this last offseason
Anybody notice THT not wanting to shoot @ the end of the 3rd qtr & 4th so he won’t mess up his %😭
For some reason, when the ball is in the hands of Monk and Lebron, I feel a sense of relief. But with Westbrook, I feel like 50/50 and stressed. No disprespect!
5:44 stepping the line during inbound...lol.
Malik out there lookin like the new JR Smith 2.0 🔥
1 win over .500 trashtalking a16-22 team.  Lakers play the Suns, Dubs or Griz, they lose by 20.  Trash talk then.
37 yrs  old!! 37!!! There is no doubt who the goat is! Goatjames!!!!!!!
One thing i love about monk. HE ISNT AFRAID OF THE SPOT LIGHT.
Love how Bron didn't settle for jumpers but instead attacked the rim in crunch time.
go lakers
Congrats lakers winning the game over sac-town
At 5:45, Howard is stepping on the baseline as he inbounded the ball😀😀😀😀😀😀
And the lakers girls looking good stunning and beautifully pretty faces makeup pretty eyes amazing bodyies drips so flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy heaven must be missing angels y’all ladies keep it g’s and dope tatt’s
Dame it a lot of fine ladies looking good stunning and beautifully pretty faces makeup pretty eyes amazing bodyies drips so flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ice outta bling heaven must be missing angels y’all ladies keep it g’s
The lineups the coach put out are terrible
why tf is ariza starting
Jesus loves you
“Lebron tryna break that record of most points scored of all time” he think he slick tho.😂😂
No brainer coach didn't put Thompson lol.
Might be wrong on this one but this just came to mind wht if lebron changed to #6 because he wants to have 2 jersey like kobe
The real thing we should be happy about it RUSS HAD NO TURNOVERS!! The Lakes combined only had 5. That should tell you something. More possessions and less for the other team when everyone else does their job. TY Russ for finally being a normal PG. 🤣💯🤷🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Finally LA
I want to see more of Dwight / Monk lob town
The king who????
Lebron needs to stop complaining & get on Westbrook’s ass
It’s going to rip the hearts  out of the haters/fans when lebron retires, then realizing  there is no other NBA player as completely rounded to fill his shoes.
About time lol
Dwight's was great,Bron need more help.
Carmelo don’t stick a lick of defense.
Props to these Lakers. They gave the Kings a hard time...
Lebron has the most passion for basketball ever. Walking billionaire 😂👑 the fake goat was throwing dice on the table shit talking and loving his gambling addiction 😂😂
Dwight Howard won this game.
Finally getting the rebound after a missed shot
AD 👀 salty
Whoevers editing this video needs to get fired.
NBA  suxs  no d joke love hoop college  ball  better  stay strong Yanks are no1 USA
Melo has thee smoothest jumper I’ve ever seen. Thing of beauty
Trade AD
Year 19 showing glimpses of year 12. Carrying team on them big boy shoulders...
Bron en Ruzz💪👀
Lebron gon mess around and carry this team to 5th or 6th seed
Monk finally getting the shine he deserves. He been a bucket.
It goes to show how how good Lebron really is. All he needs is one or two people stepping up and filling some shoes and the Lakers are winning. Incredible!
Malik Monk is our X-Factor…he can ball!
Ariza, bazemore and Jordan trade
Lakers played much better this game but let's see how they do against a team with a winning record
NBA censored the important jump ball debacle so they didnt get clowned in the comments lmao
Sorry but this is why i don't regard LBJ as the GOAT. At 7min he gets stripped of the ball & shoulders down - sulks. Then he sulks on his way to the bench a couple plays later. Did we ever see MJ or Kobe sulking? Quit on a play? Maybe, but def not as frequently as LBJ. Just sayin'
Trade Russ for Antonio Brown..Can't get any worse.
lakers looser..
9:20 Does anyone know if he actually made this half court shot after the game?
Didn't watch this game. But just on the highlights, seems like Westbrook wasn't able to touch the ball the whole of 4th.
two straight home-game wins. way to go.  I knew it all along that the key to having this kind of night is getting as many players involved.
Huh...
0:55 great editing  so good for a multi billion dollar company cant even edit a basketball game correctly  but proceeds to fill them with ads for that extra revenue that they dont need at least fn earn it with a proper edit ya dipshit frs
nanalo rin
LeBron is averaging the most points in his career since 2009😍
Is lebron really 37 !? 🚀
Russ needs to be traded
3 things I took away from this game   1. Buddy Hield would have use in trouble . Russ > Hield  2. Buddy Hield had 0 impact tonight for the kings and basically been like that since he’s put on a kings uniform 3. I made this for you lakers fans who think buddy Hield would be saving us when he can’t even start for the kings and he’s a shooter lol …
I went to sleep saying we're going to win this game even after been down because I can see something about they way we are playing now is different we are goo to be crazy good in the playoffs let's go Lakers
Is this a play in tournament preview? lol
the most stacked team in history should be winning every game by 20 to 30 points right? what a fn joke of a " team "
Malik monk looks and play like jr smith
Can’t believe they didn’t call that charge on bagley bro lmao
5:43 Dwight step on the line, No call.
When will lakers learn? Start Dwight and let him get as much mins in the game like bron! Every time he was in the game the lakers happened to regain the lead!!
Lebron found his new Kyrie in Monk. Obviously not as good but hes a skilled scorer who doesnt have to be set up by bron
lebron playing center position play a huge role in their small-ball lineup,if this winning strategy will bring them to 6th spot and avoid the play-in,next season they will trade ad!
Westbrook finished with 0 turnover. His first since 2016.
How many prime does this man have to be playing better at 37 than he did at 27 smh this is not fair.
Listening to ROSETTA GLE - “LEBRON “ RIGHT NOW😎🎶🔥
For me howard stay  of all game
As a lebron james fan I knew lebron james was going to at least top 5 this year after all these years but I was wrong because that man is playing like he still the best player in the world 🌎 This is crazy to me
#LetsGoLakers 💜 💛
LeClutch is back💪
797,000 views and climbing. Hopefully the Lakers have turned the corner and are on the rise.
Lebron james is clearly the mvp but because of the team record he won't be considered but if the Lakers can climb to 3rd or 4th seed he will be the mvp and that would be crazy for a 37 year old to win mvp
Enjoy that 9th seed lebrandon
Can we just appreciate how Russell had zero turnovers in this game.
Malik Monk is the best pickup Lakers got straight up all around player and dumb athletic
Lebron playing like he did when he first started
its sad that the kings are the lakers most competitive game every time
Lebron needs a raise
Despite how awful the Lakers are this season, if they're in the playoffs it's hard to bet against them with a healthy Lebron, a serviceable AD, and a motivated Westbrook.
The only position LeBron technically hasn’t played is shooting guard.
Lakers schedule so far was a gift. With the level of competition they've got this second half, they cannot drop to any of the bottom tier clubs or they don't make the play-in. Lucky 4 them, the West is full of sub 500 teams
I used to be a big fan of Dwight. Sucks he never developed
Today, NBA players compare with the '80s & the '90s, almost 97% shoot from points and way beyond. Time change even when people talk about how good and hard those days are. To me, there are more good & skills payers than before. They may not be as complex or strong, but muscle takes you to a certain point; on the other hand, 🧠's in this game is 🔑.
Suddenly unexpectedly watched dwight stepped the line. 5:44
i'd be curious to find out if there is a player that misses more point blank layups than Westbrook..
Finally a game where i can finally watch without Westbrook truning the ball over 100 goddamn times
Fun Fact: Russell Westbrick is averaging less ppg than Tyler Herro and Julius Randle this season.
Why is Barnes and Heild still on the Kings?🤷🏻‍♂️
This what a million dollars a year on your body look like guys I'm not surprised!
Bron was being a great QB last night
When are the lares going to play good teams, I swear this has to be weakest schedule. It’s sad
Awesome effort by everyone, but love the effect that Dwight is having! Keep in up fellas!
I have been saying the problem is A. Davis. He's 28 years old on his supposed PRIME TIME and doesn't produce. With J. Embiid or Karl Anthony-Towns, the Lakers would be unstoppable. Before this year, I didn't follow or know much about M. Monk, but I liked how he played.
Please trade Westbrook!!
Lakers play 1 on 1 every time down the court. Wonder why they struggle to beat weak teams
Vogel is an idiot for putting Lebron in Center.
MONK NEEDS MORE MINUTES! THANK GOD THEYRE GIVING IT TO HIM!
I love Monk and Dwight’s energy they bring keep them in the starting lineup!
WHAT THE HECK!!!!!! Lebron doing jump ball at beginning of the game!!!???
Mark my word this is the turning point for the Lakers they recognize that LeBron will lead them they just have to scrap and be ready. Also I knew Malik Monk was a steal when we got him . I pray we can resign the young guy
they need to play those centers :(
Lebron just sat and watched avery bradley get taken to the hole 6:25 1st quarter😤
Call me crazy but lakers looking fine without AD. Im trading his glass ass for assets and players.
Unsung hero. DWIGHT!
KD and the Nets are 0-7 against winning teams this year have yet to best a top 4 team  So I'm ok with the Lakers slow start as long as the Nets struggle too
Why did they cut out LeBrons block?
If only Westbrook could play like this every game and not have any turnovers
Malik is the most consistent guy
Lakers dirty game boring
This was a outstanding team effort by the Los Angeles Lakers Malik monk played great Dwight Howard played great and Carmelo Anthony was crucial when the game was on the line hitting those difficult shots when the team needed it most and LeBron James was just outstanding all game long Taylor Horton Tucker played a good game and he's getting better as the season comes along and Austin Reeves  is just a factor on the basketball court anytime he's out there the defense is better and the team plays better as a whole💯🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
See what happens when you play your big man Dwight coach Vogel??? idk why he stops playing Dwight randomly. Also Monk is developing into a much needed player who is starting to get comfortable and create his own buckets off the dribble instead of just sitting at the 3 point line waiting for a set shot. Good pick up by LA. He's young too
Love bagley. Wish my knicks traded Randle for him 🤭
W
Lakers fucking suck!! Lebrons getting stupid acting like that when your teams fucking sub par at best screaming like your a beast when your matched up against scrubs weres that same intensity when your up against some talent!!
Uncalled lane violation at 5:44
I pray whoever see this you’ll be successful in life, God has a plan for you just trust the process never give up God bless everyone… 🧡
Zero turnovers for Russ. Great job Russ. We can win a Championship with that.
😂😂😂 bron fans in the comments acting like they bussed a fat nut and are smoking a cigarette after…they feeling good 😂😂😂
Their you go again praising the Lakers winning another one against a sorry team. Lakers are nothing this year man!! Their winning against sorry teams with bad record please look up all 11 games and see to much hype for nothing Lakers need to be winning against a winning team 👎🏻👎🏻
Now that’s what I’m talking about
PRIME LEBRON: 2009, 2012-13, 2018, 2022?? MY GOAT!!
Bron... got to keep taken and making threes... for us to win... period...
You can definitely see some changes has been made with the matchup and sharing the ball cuz when Westbrook has the ball he feels as if he still playing with Oakland when you don't have to play like that when you have six All Stars, pass the ball it will make a big difference
lol dude said buddy open soon as he gets in the gym
Lebron, Westbrook, Commentators in MVP mode
Malik being the 3rd best player in this team
The got to play Dwight more. Give Russ his flowers for once, 0 turnovers.
Malik Monk becoming my favorite Laker on the roster outside of Lebron!
Go figure the the referees had to help the Lakers win in the end but I will say this for Russell Westbrook (it won't happen that much) that he will not have any turnovers he actually helped the Lakers win this time
Monk vs fox duel it out in the nba! College days at Kentucky they were DAWGS,,, or should I say cats?  U get the point, they always been like that
"When we beat that 16 - 23 team, that one right there, that's when I knew I was the goat" - Lebronda "Delonte" James
LeBron James is clutch and he did it with Kanye in the building. He needs to be in the MVP conversation.
WE COMING AND EVERYOONG KNOWS IT
Anthony Who?? We don’t need Street clothes Davis Lebron carrying the Lakers str8 to the playoffs
Yayyyy😌
Where the haters at?! You don't even have to watch the highlights lmao just look at the comments,no hating dumbasses so I guess the Lakers won,next lost they'll be ALL over the comments like sum losers😂🍻🍺
Arizza body language is not fit in the floor. I believe he should be the waterboy much better now.
Lakers play Dwight Howard they win!
Monk in this season is better than westbrook
Let’s go LA,keep it up🔥🔥🔥
Keep it up fellaz!🙌🙌
AD didn’t even high five lebron at the end of the video! 🤷🏽is there something going on bet lebron and AD?
Monk doing Westbrook's job -_-
Love how these Laker highlights always throw in a Westbrook lowlight…
Melo jumper
Lakers All Day 🔥🔥 LEBRON JAMES THE KING 👑 🔥🔥
dwight howard deserve the first 5 center postion
Good game but them lakers still in trouble.
Just need AD to come back with sum purpose now!
Malik monk best player
The Fakers and LaQueef are back on track to Win it All.🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳#18.
look at 5:43 howard step on the line
Struggling against a bad team 😂😂😂😂
Its the kings tho😂😂😂😂
Lakers fans are not impressed. They are just winning on teams they're suppose to win. Teams 9th placers and below or non playoff teams.
3 Peat Win let's go lakersss❤
Lebrons looking like a MVP
Well done Russ👍🏾 0 turnovers lets keep it up🤙🏾
The just refuse to properly use D Howard. He gets the minutes, he dominates.
Buddy still mad Lakers chose Westbrook over him he only get up for the Lakers
MALIK MONK IS THE BEST ! 🔥🔥
Lakers pieces are falling in place it's getting scary 😨
Trade AD
Howard played amazing! He needs to be on the court more often!
Did anyone notice the foot of Howard? @6:01 :) Out of bounds
Lakers fans in a nutshell: Celebrating wins against rebuilding and 12th - 15th seeded teams: ✔️✔️✔️ Celebrating wins against playoff seeded teams: 👎👎👎👎
The refs just hate LeBron dont they. I counted 7 no calls.
Those missed offense foul calls Lebron was taking show how much officials hate Lebron. The other day they gave Harden 26 free throws. They’re bad at their job and need to be replaced by robots 🤖
Man, if we got to see Olympic Melo in the NBA Finals, that'd be mighty nice.
Kings. Are. Garbage 🗑️.  What. Happen. Against. Grizzlies,    people. Go. Look. At.  The. West. Standing.  From. Lakers. Down 👇.  Fools. Gold
https://youtu.be/k7kAm9O4AXI
Lebron always needed a guy like Malik monk on his team. A guy with full energy, gonna create his own shot and isn’t afraid to shoot the ball
Dope to see melo get back to back buckets off one on one movies like that mid range is dangerous too
I'm not a Lebron fan, never was and never will be. But it's impossible for me to not show respect for this guy. He's 37 years old and is playing like he was 25. How many prime time does he have? People who hate him are just out of their mind.
Great win........against the kings..... Lakers may not even get into the playoffs...we suck.
CENTER    - JORDAN PFORWARD-HOWARD SFORWARD-DAVIS SGUARD-     JAMES PGUARD-     WESTBROOKMONK
always remember Howard and DJ are both healthy but this fucki'n low IQ coach vogel opted to start small ball lineup..this no brainer coach is a bitch! vogel please take yourself out of Los Angeles.
Let’s go Lakers!
Hey, so it's for sure that an algorithm edits these videos at this point. Please hire a human. And have a nice day.
Fire this editor. Terrible.
Lakers starting to look like they’re finding themselves and the game they want to play. They have shown flashes of greatness all season but been lacking consistency due to all the injuries causing lack of chemistry waiting to see what kendrick nunn will bring to the team💯
LeGoat doing 🐐 shit. My mans is 37 and averaging 28 ppg. NO OTHER PLAYER CAME CLOSE. The highest I believe is from MJ or Kobe which was 23 ppg. We’re cooking Kareem
Lebrons smile faker than the $3 bill 🤣
https://youtu.be/qeJAZgiWIxc
Lebron is good.
it's the kings 💀
Kong tutuosin mahina Ang Lakers, kc 4qurter na dikit pa score
:Lakers could not afford to lose a 0 turnover game by Westbrook, I'd be doubting everybody except lbj and malik and that point.
Malik Monk is BALLING.
I like this version of Brodie. Less assist but zero turnover.
Kainurag lebron loloan win
You mean kings @ king?
Maybe theLakers they need to trade anthony davis to other teams, because the lakers rotation is much better without davis. And davis is prone of injury he is not same before
Damn I feel bad for melo man. This was supposed to be the year he grab a ring. No way it’s happening with this shit play . Even if they SQUEAK into the playoffs not getting passed the suns. And DAMN sure not getting passed the warriors. Sad really
It's taco time. 🌮
wow, lefraud can still freight train to the basket in his 19th year...monica is on the lance vitamin S im callin it! its like he's 27 NOT 37!
The commentators in the 4th is why i love the lakers bro i swear lmaoo
Im so happy for monk, finally the lakers make him as a starting 5 than trash THT
Lakers are warming up
Wow. LeBron didn’t even jump for the jump ball but people still say he’s the goat. Gtfoh. I would’ve never seen Jordan standing stationary for any jump ball. It’s always a competition
Russell Westbrook 0 turnover probably the best thing that we saw un the game today
best player of the game: westbrook zero turnover..
Okay 👌👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💪🏿
Russ sacrificed his triple double for the team to win. He wasn’t playing 1000mph turning the ball over trying to get stats. Good for him. Go Lakers
Howard super alihoopman, got the attack attack defense and hipper rebound and LeBron and wonn with the rest of the Lakers Team good job...
It is amazing Russ had 0 Turnovers... ZERO... If he plays smarter like this it would be much better for them.
Now the entire lebron haters are crying. Trying to find alibies why the warriors blew the 3-1 lead.
There starting to gel at the right time. Stanley Johnson, Malik monk, tht and Kendrick nun( once he’s back)mixed with the vets. Also with bron playing the way he is, this team will be dangerous come play off time
Bron you the goat man idc what no one say!
Lebron plays every position better than the players on his team who actually play that position.
At this point we can agree Lakers will be 41-41 when the season ends. Have a miracle beat whatever team for a play in spot then proceed to oddly enough dominant a bit in the playoffs IF everyone is healthy with no street clothes 😂 not even a Lakers fan but I can definitely see that outcome.
4 straight wins
So is Twitter going to blow up every time the lakers win? Don’t understand how Lakers fans can be happy with this team this year
The Lakers should move THT and keep Monk. Monk is a better basketball player... THT is seen as a valuable asset to other teams. Could get something nice that’s needed...
LeBrOn IsNt ClUtCh
I’m not sure they need AD. Maybe trade him for another wing scorer since all he wanna do is shoot jumpers anyway
But haters gonna hate 😂😂😂
Yessir,another great team performance,lakers going up
Dwight is the best big man Lakers could have plays hard every possession I think his mins has to do w/(Lebron) not liking him
Hmmm, does it seem like the announcer it REALLY favoring the Lakers when they score VS the King's player when they score? Unless your a hire Lakers announcer to call the game PLEASE be neutral or show the same excitement for both teams when they score. Thx!
Westbrook 0 turnover
Lebron is not going for a ring anymore..hes just staying Fit until hes Son joins the NBA and it will be a media frenzy... there will be a lot of "First Father and Son to ____ fill in the blanks______" shenanigans to happen
The kings vs The KING
I didn't know the "Im a FUCKING PROBLEM" he said was directly to the sac town kings. Even tho he aint been playing like a king would, he is. And that just reminds me of how that muhfuhh is the king. boy has been in the NBA longer than he has not. if that makes sense. you get what im saying. Thanks SAC town for giving us a great game, AND THANK YOU LAKERS for WINNING this great match.
??? Where in the world was Stanley Johnson?? They better not let that man go
Lakers getting back on track👀
now they need to beat best teams in the NBA the ultimate test is against the  Memphis grizzles.
SOLID LAKERS NATION UNSTOPPABLE 18 MATIK SAKALAM OMSIM LBJ ACTIVATE PLAYOFF MVP MODE
Wheres stanley johnson?
AD might break his nose wearing that mask 😷
I want to see lakers do it to an elite teams
Westbrook won the game. 0 turnover
King James!
Lakers got to find a way to keep Malik beyond this year cause he getting paid after this year
Y’all fuckin suck at editing these videos 😂
Russ with 0 turnovers. He had a productive game and I hope he continues to play like this.
I’m convinced lebron will play till 43
2:40 that’s elite footwork
Since no one gonna say it I will, shout out to Russ for 0 TO’s!!
No blooper reel tomorrow on undisputed for Russ🤣🤣🤣
Lebron is playing way to good know. And I think he relazie that if he going to win and depending on anybody he going to have to depend on his self. He playing great basketball. But I notice when AD is not on the court lebron just take plays a different. He like in beast mode
20-19 standing this season, hopefully year 2022 will be a W column for LA Lakers and AD will be back for healthy
LeBron, THT, Howard, Russ, Malik, and Melo putting a work today!! lezgo Lakers! 3 Ws in a row, keep it up!
Malik is showing why he needs to be a starter and remain a starter. Lakers have a squad man
LeBron just let his opponent get the Jumpball such a humble KING
Brodie with no turnovers & Superman finally getting minutes! 💪🏽👏🏾
MONK IS ABIG HELP TO LAKERS
No one can stop LBJ's clutch ability PERIOD.
Labronda's Lakers got The referees on the pay roll!!!
3 in a row LakeShow. Let's gooooo
Am I the only one who thinks this commentator is enthusiastically biased towards lakers. He has 2 different tone of enthusiasm for lakers and any other team ??
its good to see davis on the bench.
Lakers need these to get their confidence back before the schedule gets brutal
Lebron just flipped the switch when they need it most
I like how they be highlighting Russ missed layups lol
If LeBron takes this team to the playoffs and beyond he needs that MVP
Lmao 0:06 lebron with the smoothest fake out
If Lakers won 8 or 6 in a row lebron will be in MVP candidate
Russ finally ended his turnover streak of 400+ consecutive games. Last time he finished a game with 0 turnovers was march of 2016. Great Win and shout outs to Monk, Howard and Buddy Hield. Wish we traded for him still.
Thank CB for the Lakers Run. Just two games to go
That's how lebron has to play he need that Jordan killer instinct good shit
So are we just gon act like LeBron didn’t jump for the ball in the beginning
Wow russ has zero turnovers?? Unbelievable
💜💛💪
Let's goooooooooo Lakers ❤
I think they made bron too old with the wrinkles in the timeline to make the and 1 so dramatic over a youngster. Haha. Nice editing in the timeline.
It doesn't matter which team they're up against. People will always find a reason to hate. So what if they were playing the Kinga? Heck, they even lost two games to OKC. No matter what people say, 5 turnovers as a team is good.
Haters grow old!! But bron still remains as the king!! Haha
💍 for melo & westbrook 🙏
There’s only 1 👑 and he play for the Lakers
LeBronJames #KINGJAMES👑🔥
Just stay healthy LBJ or else this team would exit early..
Let's go haters ! ..
Go lakers
💪💪💪💪💪💪💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Sometimes injuries(Anthony Davis) are blessings in disguise and still benefit the team.The Lakers chemistry has benefited.
whoever idea it was to start Malik Monk has alot of common sense
Best Lakers game so far. Ball movement was on point. Lebron is on another level.
king>kings
are lebron and phil still made at each other 😂
WHERE IS DENNIS RODMAN WHEN YOU NEED HIM???????????????????....
Don't look now,  but I think the Lakers are starting to click.  Don't sleep on them.
NO TURNOVERS FOR THE RUSS!!!
Great job by the Lakers for letting lebron James closing and told russ to settle down😂 just play defense in the 4th quarters . Uncle Shay undisputed tomorrow👍
Lakers played well, LeBron clutching it up as always 💪
I LOVE AT THE LAST TWO SECONDS OF THE GAME THE KINGS  LET LEBRON GO THRU HIM LIKE ...ALL MY COUSINS ARE LEBRON FANS......😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This game means shit. Lakers are still trash.
Love to see my Lakers winning this team always had the right players they just needed to gel. Westbrook getting 0 turnovers and them winning  3 in a row is a good sign.
Congrats Lakers for beating bums!
Finally a rare game THT plays well while Lebron is playing. Such a huge difference how he plays when Lebron doesn't for whatever reason. Hoping he keeps it up!
They need to trade A.D. already were way better without him.....
Lebron you a 🤡🤡. Talk yo sht to the top teams
BALLsacRAmentos is by far the most uninspiring franchise in team sport. Just sell the fucking team! Let an evil billionaire in Seattle buy it. So we can get the Sonics back.
Looks like the Lakers are finally on a role!!!
Attention...... There will be no Skip Bayless Westbrook highlight reel tomorrow because Westbrook had ZERO turnovers 😳
Monk been balling‼️
Give Dwight more PT!!!!
malik comin back a huge reason they winning games again.
Fox/Bagley+ a pick or 2 for Simmons
WTF?  Lebron didn't even jump on the tipoff.  That was the weakest tipoff I have ever seen.
Monk balled out ! DHow needs more PT w those small defenders
Lebron james idol 💟🖤💚💛💜
A good game Los Angeles Lakers well played.
LeBron is the greatest Laker GM of all time!!!
Howard did great help  from the Lakers. Lbj and Malik play great. I wanna see Lakers beat Suns and GSW.
How many times lakers have been playing them sorry ass team mostly every team they beat is under 500 I feel like they play the king like 5 times already.
Love to see LeBron and Monk on floor together.  Vogel will screw it up and try something different  though.
That was a glimpse of old lebron at the end
looks like monk wAnts to prove something
Play Dwight more that man played great
WHERE THE WESTBROOK HATERS AT? YEAH BACK INTO YOUR CAVES YOU GO INCELS
Lets be honest d way lbj playin for his age is unreal
WESTBROOK BROKE HIS OWN TURNOVER STREAK.
Russ looks a lot more comfortable as a Laker, let’s give him his credit when it’s due !
What happened to Stanley??? Hope we're not done with him yet
5:42 Violation SMH refs
Lebron could/ will play until he breaks the all time scoring record
5:42 Violation SMH refs
These wins w/o AD says a lot.
9:22 when you wannabe steph curry.
Everyone praising the Lakers like they did something. They're beating teams that's below them, which they should. Not impressed. Still haven't proved they can win against the top teams. Lebron should feel like a joke flexing on teams that more mediocre then his team.
Still waiting for the age thing to matter against the Lakers
Malik Monk on 🔥 right now
WB zero turnovers....awesome
Horrible editing
lakers fans..still delusional front runners
Another rigged game for princess James and the lakers.
Good job Russ. Ik everyone hating but good job taking care of the ball and still getting it done. This is still only the beginning stay healthy everyone
Malik Monk!!!!!!!!!!
“Beware of an old man in a profession where men usually die young." - Anonymous
Who else  in the nba could play 5 positions like lebron? The "King" is the GOAT. PERIOD.
The prime lebron is back this 2021 22 season
When LeBron didn't jump for the jump ball at the start of regulation, it was hilarious. He was like, "too old for this sh*t." Strategy? 😆
Malik Monk the new J.R Smith 👀
Melo is a bucket. Not as high volume as he used to be but he’s still Melo. I’m still surprised that he spent a whole season not playing
This win was a grind. Because of their age they're not the best team in the league and they have to really work for most of their victories. Their best talent are all future Hall of Famers who are well into their 30s and on the back side of their careers. It makes this team with an embarrassment of riches almost an underdog kind of story. A strange team for a strange year and era in sports and the world at large.
i was bet Los Angeles Lakers $5M Dollar
Westbrook seems out of place like he doesn’t know what to do?
Lakers communication is getting better on the court!
How many times do they play against the kings? Lmao im guesing they will play against the rockets again huh? Or okc? Never saw the lakers play against elite teams but the teams below .500
Yaw play against Sac like they a potential play off team.
She what happened when Russ was on the bench 👀
Lebron doing business during jump ball
Y’all need to hire a new editor
08:54 another Amazing defensive effort by the king LBJ he deserves DPOY. just give it to him already.
For a highlight reel edited Buy the NBA, this video was bad. The weird fat cuts and everything
is all about Lebron?
Monk was the only reason I watched the bobcats
Lebron may go down as the goat. Nobody was doin this consistently at 37 not MJ nor Kobe and I’m huge fan of all 3
Washed 👑
Lebron a BEAST bro
? Where is Anthony Davis. Injured as usual. Trade him. 40 percent of the time this guy is injured.
It would be more easier for WESTBROOK to pull his nasal hair than to get a zero turnover! I'm still in shock
👉🏾👌🏼
No triple OT tonight
I mean they beat the kings I guess they r headed in the right direction⛑
screw the Lakers your team is taking everything we worked for morjerfuckers
A nga2
Now that was team basketball 🔥
Malik Monk is having a really good season. He’s way better than I thought he was gonna be.
Another good team game by the lakers. Dwight killing in the paint. And Westbrook no turnovers got to love that. 👌
What Lebron is doing at this age is absolutely unbelievable !! 👑
If dwight or d jordan has the iq of lebron playing center. This team is deadly .. 😜
So this is LBJ playoff mode activated. Hope it's on till the end of their playoff run if they qualify. Russ is not just Russ like he was with PG or even Harden. If Russ is relegated to a role player they should just trade and accept losses.
Always satisfying beating the Queens #rivalriesneverdie
Russ played like the guy we have never seen before. 0 turnovers. Holy Cow. Great game russ. Play like this, you can be a productive member of this team.
Why is everyone overhyping this Lakers win over a 16-23 kings team   at home?
Pang playoffs na laro ni king lebron💪🔥 keep it up idol , sana tumagal kapa sa liga✊
great help on Rebounds + Defense by Dwight dont focus on Triple-Double RUSS = and WIN is come
Just…. Wtf wrong with Russ….
Right arm bo tats strictly for buckets.
Is it just me or does Munk remind you of a young JR Smith 🤔
a game this close with the KINGS isn’t anything to brag about.
First time I've seen lebron close a game in 2 years
0:08 LeBron not jump
Yeah malik monkkkkk
The real king handled the kings 👑👑
The Lakers is Back now and on Fire,,,Go Go Lakers
Another close win for fakers they can't beat any good teams lol 😆 nice win tho LeBron still a good player at his age.
37 years i dont think so
Stanley Johnson needs to play tho. To keep that toughness on the floor. Great coaching playing Dwight we need those rebounds and making them second guess in the paint.
One thing I kept noticing during the game and along with these highlights is AD's attitude and lack of cheering on his teammates. Seemed off. Im a Laker fan btw.
Westbrick is the problem... Really... Make him come from the bench and let LeBron play the point and do small line up most of th time
⭐♨️⚂⚅ 👑 ⚅⚂♨️⭐
Good job Lebron james
everyone, lakers are finding them selves 😂 nah man . covid protocolos finding the teams they playing against. lebron still putting up numbers. the lakers just don't have the legs to play defense. defense win championship. GSW are great not only cuse they can shoot lights out but cuse they play D. bulls starting 5 and bench play D. lebron carmelo THT monk westbrook they all too lazy on defense. is like playing IT. he can get you 20 points but the opponent gonna score 30 on him and grab his rebounds. so what value he holds ??
Trade AD..
Nice turn around! Curb your expectations folks. They win a few games and everyone starts screaming NBA champs!!! ...lets keep it real ok? Lets settle for making the playoffs and getting past the first round... Despite the greatness of LBJ, there is no way we can win against a few of these teams. Sad, but true.
When I heard Westbrook had 0 turnovers I came straight here.
I love LBJ,CONGRATS lakers 💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏
Y’all see how quick davion Mitchell be
Kings got Absolutely screwed at the end with 28.4 seconds with that miserable Ruling to a  jump ball I completely don’t understand why that was called that would’ve been clearly Sacramento’s rebound and he would’ve dribbled up floor … the only reason he waited and didn’t touch the ball so kings could gather up court and then he would pick it up and takeoff off so the clock would’ve started then ticking down REFS ARE A JOKE
Referees before the game starts - - hey guy's no matter what, don't call any fouls on Sacramento Kings.. Other 2 referees - - Kool no problem.. 😂 ✌️
That's 3 inna row baby!!! Let's keep the Dub Train going!!!
Trade reaves for clarkson.
Malik monk plays like jr Smith with Lebrun
The king of all GOAT🏆🏆🏆❤
Stanley Johnson needs to be on that roster…he brought a defensive toughness
Lakers gonna lose the next game...anyone wanna bet
Editor was a little zooted tonight -_-
Normal quotidian-
Dwight did his thing
Watching the Lakers play is comedy
5:44 you know refs are awful this day..
Lakeshow
Anyone else peep Bron not giving a fuck in the jump ball at the start of the game? 😭
I'm no big Lebron fan but that was an obvious charge at 4:58. Ref stupid as fuck.
Hey hire good editors pls!
This team is destroying westbrook i knew he could not fit in . He is a very special player but needs a good team too .  The Pelicans would be a perfect fit . Enough space to dominate , enough shooters , good centers and just wait for a Zion comeback if that ever happens and this team would give the same feeling as watching the bulls right now .
Reminds me of the Cowboys. Play the same trash teams and swear they doing something.
Finally THT hits a three
I don't watch basketball that much, but it seems like Lebron plays so much better in the last few minutes of a game. idk if its a gear that isn't sustainable the entire game, or if its for longevity reasons, but he is unstoppable when he "tries" that's how it appears.
Russ got no turnovers look how that turned out
Why is EVERYBODY on the Lakers better than Russ???
The fact the Kings could of drafted Monk along  with Fox is crazy to me
AD gotta come off the bench
"THE KING" slays the kings....
Pause the video at 7:04 and you’ll see why the lakers are horrible right now. Lebron having to do too much on his own that shit blew me away. His entire team is basically out of the frame
Malil Monk is an All Star! ⭐⭐⭐
37 years old and STILL the KING of the NBA!! Wtf is going on here!!?? He’s NOT the average human! He’s! Just! DIFFERENT!!! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽✊🏽🔥🔥👑🐐
Playing less small ball Is the key!
A lot of people mentioned trading for Buddy Hield but I don't see him doing anything other than doing 3 pointers.
Rigged game against kings again
"Im a mfkin problem" 🐐
They only defeat hey a trash can team
Youre not a goat hahaha
Westbrook with 0 turnover??
Monk a monster fr fr he ball hard definitely a steal
Could Jordan play Center?!
Lakers when LeBron plays Center: 4-0
Nice win lets go 💯❤️🔥
4:57 was like the most textbook way to take a charge how tf do refs miss that lol I've never seen feet more planted
anyone else's video play the same highlight twice at :58?
Now that was how the lakers suppose to take care of business 👌🏾😏
Malik is our second scoring option now without AD!
It was a nice game for both team. But Lakers FT shooting was pretty bad! Wasted points.. Lol
This looks familiar 7:56
Congrats l.A
Where is my Lakeshow fam at?!!! Roll Call...
Love seeing Lakers fans hopeful just makes it that much more sweeter when they lose to teams above 500
Lakers are starting 2 look promising.Playoffs 💯
Westbrook zero TO for me is sensational. At least he cut his consistency on giving much turnovers 😁
Now this was something--Lakers fans chanting M-V-P for a player on a .500 team. Seriously, Lakers fans, get over yourselves 'cause you're frickin' ridiculous. I admire LeBron as much as the next guy, but that's just stupid. Your team ain't good enough, and that's that. You're celebrating a win over the Kings??!! LOL!!!
Dwight won them this game.
Lol Lakers fans will find any win against a bad team as an argument for playoffs or title contention.
Think if we could get a 3 and d and a defensive anchor like Myles turner will be just fine
6:38 Russ just wants to be on every possible poster tf.
W lakeshow
Title of this video is misspelled.  Title : King at Lakers
Lakers under 500 pct congrats fight fight fight ..
"0 for his last 16" announcer did him dirty
Love monks game bro
ABOUT DAMN TIME! Good job closing the game! Congrats Lakers
refs rigged the game for the lakers as usual
Lakers fans excited about a kings lose 😂don’t worry
Let’s Go LA💜💛let’s keep it up. One game at a time ✅we getting better every game
Malik monk not westbrook.
if westbrook can do this everygame then the lakers can at least make playoffs
Just wanna see Russ haters, when he has no turnover, they will focus on his fg%
I think the editor is doing the error on purpose
I think russ avg 20 5 5 would be the best things for the Lakers. Its when he tries to do too much his the game really gets away from him. Keep it simple
Malik is gonna get a big bag after this season. I hope Lakers will pay him. His shooting form stays the same for every shoot. Dude has a nice release that's for sure
This dude head bigger that Bonds in 2003 and y’all act like he doing this naturally 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💉💉💉💉💉
Could have went either way. When Howard gets 20+ minutes a game, it's an automatic 10+ rebounds a game. Give the guy more playing time.
Le🅱️R🅾️n. 🚫.  👑.
Is it just me or do they ply better without AD ? 🤔
I keep watching 90s games these days
I LIKE it...in, and up-and-down game, against some young horses:  ...We got the "W".  Shout-outs to Melo: GET BUCKETS, bruh*lolz*........................!!
These Highlights was trippin in the beginning 😂
What do you guys think about this Lakers win?   💜💛
When LeBron puts his head down and goes to the rim in the clutch it’s pretty much a sure victory but when he settles for jumpers no guarantees.
Thank you My Lakers won!!!!
Ad is the problem of lakers
GOD BLESS US ALL PO AND ALWAYS PRAY TO LORD OUR GOD 💖
Keep the streak alive LAL!
Till they consistently beat good teams they still a play in team
Lakers are gonna lose next match
it’s actually shocking how Lebron is 37 and can drive so fast to the basket still and score this guy is something else @9:00
Dwight needs more minutes
Season comes down to AD
https://youtu.be/doX0po1ziAM
More proof that the NBA rules don't apply to LeBron:  1:33 Lebron sets another illegal screen opens for wide open 3 1:45 Allows Fox wide open layup right in his face 1:55 Never even crosses halfcourt on D while being a crybaby 3:35 Kings part the lane to let LeBron layup uncontested 5:12 Lebron leaves his man open for 3 trying to pad rebound stats 6:35 LeBron lets his man dunk 7:05 Offensive fouls, travels, and then turns ball over 7:15 Another shoulder shrug on defense 8:00 Dwight holds LeBrons defender allowing another wide open layup 8:40 Kings allow Lebron offensive rebound and then travels before putback 8:54 Allows Fox layup in his face 9:05 Kings allow LeBron right down lane for layup.  Buddy Hield just watches the layup  Al this while guarding the worst player on the court again as usual and being defended by # 30 whoever that bum is.  Malik Monk saved the so called King again allowing LeBrawn to get all the praise yet again from the Bronnies out there.
They need to put Dwight in regular rotation, he still got it.
Whoever edited this needs to be fired ASAP
I love my mans THT, but his barber gotta go bro.
MELO BETTER GET A RING OR...
bruh trade this man fucking ariza mans got 0 impact on game
Pos4 and Pos5 who can provide spacing by their 3pts capabilities threat is necessary to make the lineup work with Westbrook. That’s the only reason why the rockets with Russ made it into the playoffs and barely into the 2nd round. LeBron and AD has no choice but to adjust
Ok I'll give the Lakers credit yawl getting it together lol congratulations
Chamba
year 19 <> 37 yrs 😤👑  BRON MONK DUO!!!!!
Heilds face when he hit that 3 at 8:25 You should've traded for me BRUH
Dwight Howard need to out there more
The video editing for these highlights were  poor this time around. Normally these highlights are on point.
That tip off 🤣
Since the Lakers are always the talk of every media outlet even though it’s 29 more teams.. they will make the playoffs and even make it passed the first round .. the team that’s talked about will go far for ratings 👀… lol idk what I’m saying I’m high 😂 good game from both teams 💪🏾💪🏾
Chills🔥
Malik monk I would recommend keeping him around after bron retires!
I don’t get it. They gave away rondo to make room for Stanley Johnson . But then he doesn’t get any minuets. Lakers give up 31 points in the first quarter. That just gives these bad teams confidence thinking they have A chance at winning.
Cant believe THT was 0-16 from three before this game. Shit better not happen again
The king is the real deal power move 💪💪💪💪💪 them lebron is the clear star and the hearth and soul in of the Lakers team even as and Russ playing
Malik Monk deserves a contract extension already!
Do you guys relize lebron is adding more stats to the arguement???? By the time he is done with the nba he will be considered the number 1 goat with no discussion
NBA should hire a new editor.
Bron is playing sensational
Finally Russell Westbrook end hes streak 1 turnovers,   March 14, 2016 over 430 games
https://youtube.com/channel/UCWRYtUUB0cC9RDHuj-m1G2A
THT trade value needs to be volcanic hot for the next few days
Lost angeles gaykers only can beat is g league team !! Lebum bloated stomach Jems is so trash overrated 😭😭😂😂🤣😭😂😂🤣🤣2x finals sweep and Kobe is ball hog trags 🤣🤣😂😭😭😭😭
All these comments are about lbj and not Malik monk who really step up his game. this kid is JUST UNDERRATED
They need to give howard more time...small ball will not work for them in the long run...
Man..they needed that win.
that's why im idolize lebron,he share the ball for his teammates..💪🏼
W
anybody knows d aaron fox's shoes?
Nobody gon talk about that bs call at the end of the game?
Finally the Lakers beat the Kings tonight
If Russ can play like this without any turnovers or 2 or 3 at the most Lakers will be fine.
Let’s goooooo
Okay, I'm calling it. LeBron passing Kareem in points by early to mid 2023.
They beat the kings cmon now that’s a garbage ass teams
Let's give it up to lebron and no one else lol
Are we including low lights as well? Ya'll did someone dirty. Lol
I like LBJ playing center but not if they going to give up offensive rebounds and alot of points in the paints.
Lakers fans standing ovation for 0 turnover Russel Westbrook 💜💛
Haters!!! What more do y'all want from lebron? He ain't in his 20's he's in his late 30's and still providing stats like he is in he's prime..
This is the NBA's YouTube page  you guys can surely afford some better editing come on man. What's all this double clips and half highlights stuff about. Asking nicely for you all to step it up.
Lakers fan here. As for that bad call at the end of the game, although it didn't affect the game outcome, Lebron's behavior was concerning. It reveals his desperation for wins. I like to believe that, no matter how close the game was, a younger Lebron would have done the right thing and not jumped for the ball. This was analogous to a drop-kick play in soccer, and it makes me sick to see the so called "GOAT" act like a steaming pile of shit. I hope "King" gets more calls like this, because the Lakers clearly need them to beat marginal teams. His antics are making me question my loyalty to the franchise.
I just hope the Lakers don't end up with a the 7th or 8th seed. They are not ready for the sun's or gsw yet
👊👊👊
Damn buddy hield would of been nice on the lakers over westbrick
Laker💜 shit💛!!!!!
Someone needs to help westbrook learn how to layup cuz he used to just throw down a nasty dunk of he was coming in too fast down the lane. But now he cant do that and just smacks the ball off the glass😭
Kings every year rebuilding mode
💜💛💜💛💜💛💜
Great game
Lakers 4-1 now in Bron center position
damn lakers better keep monk he’s been our second best player so far
9 straight 30 point games R U KIDDING ME LEBRON, YEAR 19!!!
Lol no Russell Westbrook highlights whatsoever…..
Starting to think the problem is AD this season 🤔
Man the Kings got robbed at the end.
Lebron legit disrespected Kings by not even attempting at the jump ball lmao .
why the hell on earth Ariza is starting or Howard..??
The king 🐐
Another proof that LeBron is the GOAT!! 😉
Y’all rm Lebron cavs when they was like 4th seed and still made it to the finals? 😭 yea don’t sleep on the Lakers especially when ad get back and nunn finally play 🤫
Lakers seem better without AD
I watch these highlights because the day Lebron retires will be league changing day. Appreciating his greatness and how he impacts and will impact the game
Ad refuse to play 5, Lebron plays all five that is some leadership. There is no way Ad can be the leader of this squad, it just doesn't make sense.
Kings and Lakers look alike through out the game except the end result
Fuk yeah haters. Lakers are rolling now. Wins wins wins!
Let’s Go Lakers! #Mamba 💜💛
3 in a row
So clutch…you beat another team under 500 bravo 👏🏾. 2022 world champs 🤡
for those who's still don't know why they called a jump ball in the last minute:  NO ONE TOUCHED THE BALL SO IT'S GONNA BE A JUMPBALL, I KNOW THAT'S BIASED BUT THAT'S THE RULE, FOX SHOULD'VE TOUCHED THE BALL BEFORE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TIME
Is it possible for the Lakers to still be on the playoffs anyone know??
I knew from the start monk was gonna be crucial for the lakers
damn Malik is becoming the player that Lakers need badly
damn Malik is becoming the player that Lakers need badly
Anyone has espn app?  Over there it doesn’t show lebron is second leading scorer in the nba this season. I wonder why
They should have played Howard and THT more tonight
HE can win all the game he wants but in the playoffs they gonna wipeout
Malik plays like KCP 😬
We should keep malik monk as a laker
Someone wanna tell how tf did Russ go from a shooting over 81% from the free throw to shooting 67% in the past 3 years like that's just BAD
0:06 lebron be like: duh nevermind
a triggerman like monk will give the lakers a lead cmmon coach vogel you are sleeping
LeBron is STILL that Dude!!
Pfizer made $36 billion in profit this last year alone. Named businessman of the year,even. I'm really glad that has absolutely nothing to do with the reason we need to get a booster every six months for the rest of our lives. I trust them because themselves and people like Gates pay 70% of their budget. That doesnt influence their decision to approve anything,even if they end up working on the board of Pfizer now. That's how business is run. The Sackler's and the Oxycodone. Those hero"s are a gift to this world. God bless them.
The L.A. Lakers defeated the seventh-seeded Sacramento Kings. James, Monk, Tucker, Westbrook, Howard, etc. did what they were supposed to do...protect their home court. Just another home game, of course! Sacramento isn't going anywhere. The Houston Rockets aren't going anywhere, either! This particular Lakers unit aren't going anywhere, PERIOD!!!
Trade dearon fox
Monk 3rd scoring option for lakers right now really keep them on winning.
All we needed was ariza 🤣
Westbrook has no turnovers and the Lakers win, wow amazing how that works...
0 turnovers from Russ never thought I’d see the day
37 and playing at a high level and plays every position even center, which his injured partner refuses to do. now thats leadership.
why cant they see that malik monk can score with an open look use the screen lalers
LAKERS played one of the softest schedules and still barely 0.500. That's greatness. Lol
Lakers now are in the 6th Seed In The West
Trade na mga player ng lakers 😃😃😃😃😃😃
Flight not going to like this one! Two "lucky" lebron 3s that he could clearly make in his sleep! LeFinisher bout to take over!
Lakers last minute, the Sacramento Kings tried so hard to make the Lakers cover 7.5. All their possessions were turnovers and even fouled the Lakers down 6 with 11 secs left. Thats a classic rigged game fellas.
lebron attacked mode 💪
20-19 ROFLMFAO! The Lakers are comedic gold. Put together an All-Star team and this is what you get. Facts...
Sooo happy seeing lakeshow winning the game. When they were down 7 in the 4th, I was praying to God to let the boys win. Thankfully, God granted my prayer. ❤
LeGOAT walking away from the jump-ball was the most beautiful display of disrespect. He pretty much said "Ya'll can have the ball first. You're still gonna' lose." 😂😂😂. He proceeds to drop 31 on their heads and help bring the W home. Amazing.   And SHOUT-OUT TO RUSS FOR HAVING NO TURNOVERS! Am I freaking dreaming? 🤣
these lakers playtime everyone should be afraid of. 💥💣💯
The scariest form of Westbrook is the no TO Westbrook Change my mind
I don't know if Lakers could make it thru the 1st round  They win almost miraculously. Goodbye Philadelphia
Brah lebron had his feet set! Nooo way!
Congratulations LBJ and Lakers Nice game!!! 💚🌿😃
LA Lakers VS Sacramento Kings Last Rematch LA Lakers won their Last Rematch from Sacramento Kings
So no one is going to talk about that jump ball call? I didn’t get it and still don’t.
After all these years and still a freaking beast!
Westbrook need to be traded
Zero turnovers for Westbrook? What is Skip gonna do tomorrow with no bloopers turnover real? Lol
Shot clock controller deserves the game ball 🙄
Nice win Lakers! 💜💛
Lbj still young, age is just a number.
Good to see my boy Dwight gettin some minutes. His high energy and defensive presence is definitely needed
why is there no screen for monk they should go for the screen  to provide a pass to lebron for an easy cutter or kick out again for a 3 pointer
Finally a game for russ without TO
Monk is playing well digging this 3 game winning streak
Lebron at center last few games too.. man can do it all
Lebron right now is a mixture of jordan and kobe finger crossed 🤞 MVP
Can’t over look Malik that boy been solid
I know Melo be frustrated sometimes cus his legs not as quick as they used to be 😂 He be like half a second too late on his blocks, but those are still some good shit contests.
No blooper reel from skip tomorrow?
Love it, Westbrook! No turnovers, let's go! Get a ring w Bron! You guys can do it
Sacramento KINGS 114 vs 123 Los Angeles LAKERS
People are always talking about RUSS turnover, Do you know, James Harden and Luka Doncic making lots of TO's than Russ? Stop the hate on RUSS!!!!
Malik Clutch!
Dwight Howard 14 points 14 rebound 💪
Its sad to see the Lakers fan happy beating on the lower-tier competition. Just look at the win-lost records of the lakers. It will tell you how garbage this current roster really is. Beat someone with a winning record.
THT really stepped it up today 💪🏼
LeBron got cheated on that charge non call.He should have gotten that call.
Russ played like he took his Ritalin before the game.
T Ariza CV  18 Min 3 Pts 0 Rebound 0 Assists
Definitely
2:48 LeBron: Yes you're back!
Bron: “I’ll take one night off from scoring 30!” Next game back to 30+…this shit is insane af
So Westbrook drops 19 points and all you can do is show one basket where the ball hits the front of the rim and goes in before the announcer laughs? This is getting disgusting now with the media.
Best all-time rivalries in the NBA 1. Lakers vs Kings 2. Lakers vs Celtics 3. Cavs    vs Warriors
8:42 nice walk eh
If Russ can play like this and Davis come back in  form  ...they truly are championship team
Anong silbi ni ariza sa LAKERS
I'm proud as a lakers fan 💜💜💜💛💛
Le4thQuarter
Man I wish Nunn would play already. I want to see that young core trio of him, Monk and THT together
Once again the lakers show us that they can beat a bad team but can’t do anything to any team over 500 unless injuries or covid take the other teams best players out. The only W here is Russell having 0 turnovers, I still don’t see why people think this team is good James can’t be putting 30 plus a game his old self isn’t the same anymore, Anthony Davids is too busy wearing street clothes and most of the time Westbrook is a brick this team is a play in team at best.
Dwight contributed a lot for 21 minutes... Solid 14 points and 14 rebounds...
What Lebron is doing is incredible, but Malik Monk has really impressed me lately. I definitely see all star potential in him
The deeper we go into the season the better their chemistry will be just in time for playoffs. #LAKESHOW
Finally! A game that Westbrook got Zero turnovers!
7:02 lebron strong as hell boi
Lakers 2022 champion Lbj fmvp !
GOOD SHIT BOYS!!!
Hey I just wanna say to everyone to continue to be happy n believe in yourself!!! Much Love n peace💯
Where's Stanley Johnson, Rob what are u doing?
I'm an MJ fan and LeBron. MJ has elegant finesse in his shots but lebron's coast to coast is sickening. Even MJ gives him props for that.
DH did good today. Props to WB with no turnover this game.
Enjoy it while you can bronsexuals
Lakers starting to look like they're finding themselves and the game they want to play. They have shown flashes of greatness all season but been lacking consistency due to all the injuries causing lack of chemistry. Waiting to see what Kendrick Nunn will bring to the group
Lets give a round of applause for Westbrook for the first time in 6 years he has no turnovers👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Good close win. Against the Kings... 😂 I'm just here to put the rest of the West on notice that Klay is coming back this Sunday. LET'S GO WARRIORS!!!
Lakers with the easiest schedule and barely beating trash teams lmao
I was at this game, it was exceptionally intense, I love how passionate the fans are when Westbrook shoots the ball 😅
Lebron is playing on another level right now. He just gets better and better every year!
KING JAMES DA GOAT! Give that man the MVP!🐐👑💪
Damnnn Russ be inconsistent with hiw turnovers, none this game. Huh, weird...
Oh no lebron is not human against kings hahahaha!
I was in the arena man the last 4 minute of 3rd qtr and the crowd cheering what a wonderful feeling that was
Lakers and Refs vs Kings..Worst call ever
Great team effort low turnover by russ, rebounding by Dwight and Monk raining threes. Not to mention lebron and THT. Kings need a big trade now.
https://youtu.be/doX0po1ziAM
Add AD and Nunn and we might have something
Praise the king
brooo , what a dub !!
Wow What A Great Performances and the Defense  was Great and The Team Works.. Congratulations Guys...#6  Lbj Our MBV, #11 Malik Monk, #0 Russell Westbrook, #39 Dwight  Howard, #5 THT, #20 Avery Bradly, and  #15 Austin Reaves, #1 Trevor Ariza, and The Whole Team... Our Head Coach Frank Vogel,  and The Coaching Staff, keep it,  up God bless you more Victories in every Games... La Nations...
Keep it up Malik Monk
LeBron adding a hundred points to his all time points every 3 games is amazing.   Hope he stays healthy throughout the season.
Showing the lebron in last second of every game is the camera man consistency...
Congratulations Lakers 💪 a win is a win no matter what this haters says about this player's f***k off they do their best to win 🙄
It's Westbrick , not Westurnover today.
Lebron might be the worst teammate ever... & Laker fans dead wrong for celebrating a victory against the kings lol
Haters been silent these past 3 games
Russ put up a quiet 19-7-2 with ZERO turnovers.  Huge defence from him at the end too.
How many 37 years old playing like LeBron I'll wait 🤔
The Lakers commentators are amazing! They’re unbiased, they provide interesting statistics, and their insights truly elevate the watching experience.
LAKERS 20STREAK WINS
0:06 Lol Lebron🤣
Please, sign Stanley Johnson, the defense sucked big time today and we only got saved cuz Malik and Lebron completely carried the offense, don't make a mistake like last season when y'all didn't gave Damian Jones an extension  Make it happen Pelinka
Anybody still sleeping 😴 on Malik Monk better wake up 😁 Good Game Lakers!
trash refs
I’m so glad at the last 56 seconds of the 4th quarter wen Lebron dropped his shoulder and took it to the paint and and 1 it cus that’s exactly what skip be wanting him to do and it pays off Everytime cus nobody can’t stop him one on one
these highlights were terribly edited
Russ 0 turnover😱
GOOD GAME 🏀 LAKERS LBJ PASSED LIKE THIS LAKERS LBJ GOING TO WIN THE NEXT 3 RINGS 💍
King vs lakers and refs
We know the lakers still can’t really dominate on the better teams this Season but don’t be so quick to count them out. They still have plenty of time to figure things out before playoff time💯 it’s not over for them
actually insane to see a 37 year old schooling dudes in their early 20s in the nba
9:05 That And 1 Play 👑
LBJ always have a great perfomance👑💪💪
I don’t know why fox didn’t just touch the ball
LBJ always have a great perfomance👑💪💪
The thing with ppl who hate on bron is they'll say hes not the best anymore skippin over the fact that he shouldnt be in the convo at all at yr 19 lol  he has a great case hes still top 3 hes still the best in my eyes tho if lakers were winning bron would be in mvp talks
These kings fans and haters thought they was beating us today
Those refs man I didn’t know this was 2002 and game 6
Yeah but they still kant win against a team over .500
The Laterals of Melo and Howard suck my god.
Now that's how you close a game! GO LAKERS!💜💛
Malik is finally showing out. The bench is finally coming together!! I’m loving what I’m seeing. Lakers going hard till the end. LFG!
Westbrook with 0 turnover😎😎😎
WOW WESTBROOK: Zero Turnovers +16 on the floor  Am I dreaming?
That last call after Monk missed the free throw then Fox got the rebound. Then ref called jump ball 😂😂🤦🤦
Sacramento played so well. That guy Buddy and Deaaron Fox. I think the best players today in Lakers were Malik Monk & LBJ
Lakers number one all over the world 🌍
Anyone else still call it the staples center despite the name change?
Interesting fact: For the first time since March 2016, Russell Westbrook ended the game with 0 turnovers! 💛💜
Westbrook redemption from his previous game.
Monk Is Really Stepping Up !!! 🔥 🔥
Lakers look good without AD this season. 🤔
Good to see my lakers win
The funny thing is Lebron is the only guy in the league who gets slandered for putting up numbers against bottom feeders.
REFS CHEATED
It's January 5 dude not 4
Malik Monk is a STUD
Glad my lakers won
trade tht.
If anyone outta these three  Melo Russ AD Shows consistency Lakers are gone be a problem for the league
bron should be atleast top 9 or 10 in mvp race
Goat bron
This team not making it
What they gone say now “it’s the kings” 😂 Good dub Lakers LeBron should be in conversation for MVP and monk is just different and Russ no turnover tonight 😳😳😳😳😳😳
hatdog
3rd straight win for the Lakers. Let's go!
Man! This could've been Lebron's 9th consecutive 30+ points game if he scored 4 more points against the Timberwolves. Regardless, still a nice win I guess...
LeGoat
Let's Go !!!!! Lakerssssss 2k22 champion 🏆💯💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💜
Lebron 37 years old and still great this had never been seen before idc who your goat is mike Kobe Kareem nun them was this elite on a night to night basics at this age and that’s facts salute this man 💯
Lebron x Malik Tandem is 🔥 And Westbrook Having a Historic Night For Having 0 Turnover 😳On To The Next One 💛💜Lezgooo LAKESHOW🔥💯😤
Melo been so productive for this laker team
Give the ball to the kingggg!!!
I’ve noticed y’all put in subliminal lowlights of Russ in these “game highlights” like why? Last time y’all added him missing a free throw late in the game.
lakers is unstable right now go go lakeshow  😙
💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💯💯💯💯💯💯
see how big of a help dwight does cmon coach gotta use him often when small ball aint workin
Lakers beat the  Pistons haters be like "They are having a hard time against the Pistons."  Pistons beats the  defending champion Bucks........No one said shit. #Hypocrisy.
This game was rigged
You beat the kings ? Ok don’t celebrate too early
This was probably the clutchest game for the Lakers as a whole on both ends...Malik Monk and THT answering the Kings early...Lebron closing...and clutch defense from Russ
Russel with 0 turnovers can’t complain 😳
I think the confusion at the end of the game would’ve never happened had fox just picked up the ball instead of letting it roll. He didn’t technically have possession of the ball and that caused all of the confusion. The game was pretty much done anyways though
Wwwwwww about times!!
Did just bron walks out in ball tip off?😂
lebron's playing center and yet driving also the offense as point forward what a 37 yrs old, this man is half HUMAN half AMAZING
Now let see what Captain save a  Fraud the Lakers hater gonna say now 😂😂
LeNother30pointgame💯💯💯💯
Stanley Johnson has to be resigned and start over Trevor Oldriza
Lakers should fire vogel
The lakers always have rigged refs. 🤣 trash can’t even win a fair game 🤦🏽‍♂️
I refuse to come on here and act impressed over this mediocre Los Angeles Lakers team defeating the Sacramento Kings. They're supposed to win this game. I'm not impressed at all.
that accidental call by the ref was odd but lebron did come in clutch
Letakeover
I'm gonna lose my shit if the lakers trade Malik monk
Lebron almost looking like 2018  bron
I feel like Westbrook was fooling us now it’s go time
King James vs uncrowned Sacramento Kings
Skip’s “Westbrook turnover lowlights” gonna be looking real empty next show. Props to Brodie and L.A for taking care of the ball tonight.
Lakers refs made up they own rules at the end lol
This is a great time to win 5 straight games. But Memphis would be a barrier to that.
When will Lebron learn the refs aren't going to give him the charge 🤣🤣
3rd straight win for the Lakers! They better not lose momentum
I never though the lakers will have so much success with bron playing at the 5
LeBron  31pts 5ast 5reb  Monk  24pts 4ast 4reb   THT  19ast 6ast 4reb 2stl  Westbrook  19pts 7reb 2ast 0 TO  Lakers win 3 in a row.
hey repent  here repent what this means is give your life to jesus and turn away from your sins and you will be saved and the blood of jesus will get you to heaven but if you live a good life and ask for forgiveness and spread the gospel etc  just start out by saying you repent like say it like i repent
The king 👑 Is back LBJ Greatest of all time!!! M.V.P
If you watched the game, you know the refs did everything they could for the lakers to win
Another win for Satan.
Malik Monk’s stat line: 24 points 4 rebounds 4 assists
LeBron James’ stat line: 31 points 5 rebounds 5 assists
LeGreatness doing his thing
That And1 basket by the king at last minute reminds me of his early cavs days he used to do that shit over and over again and no one is stopping him miss the old days
More and more hield would’ve been such a good fit to laker
Let Go Lakers! Grinding it out to get the win! I’m still on the fence about Westbrook but Bron is out of this world
2022 NBA Champions : Lakers
Russ at postgame after 0 turnovers tonight: 👁👄👁💅
LEBRON AND Malik monk Carried the Lakers 🔥 Westbrick was Westbrick as usual 😂 7-20
So basically what I understood was that since fox didn't have possession of the ball ,it was a jump ball Still a wack call tho
Bronbron❤️
Bron stepped up during the 4th quarter and lakers gotta keep monk
TT still sold. But that's my king, 3rd in a row in the new years babyyy
Westbrook with 0 turnovers what skip and shannon gone talk about now
Early
LeFullGameHighlights
LeFlop got bailed out by the Refs again
Lebron was lit 🔥 with words ‼️‼️
people should just stop hating lebron and appreciate his greatness. He's playing at his prime at 37 years old, never been done before.
LeMVP
Damnnn I’m early
Lakers in 5
King james deserve mvp consideration if they can make top 5 seed
Monk & LBJ love it!
It was a close game. But thanks to THT and Howard for stepping up, We got another win. Go Lakeshow!
Good game but it should be this close of a game when you have the “king” and westbrick 😂😂
first
Westbrook with 0 turnovers, Idk when's the last time that even happen
Lebron should not be playing this good this late in his career, PERIOD!
Laker nation💜💛💜💛
Last time Westbrook had a 0 turnover game  March 14, 2016 or a little over 400 games ago
How was that a jump ball by De'Aaron Fox?
Guys stepped on offense, defense still the problem. Season can turn around by signing Stanley Johnson and more wing defenders.
LeGM really balling in the clutch
Lebron and Monk vs Sacramento
Early gang
LeBron is overrated, and KD is better than LeBron and Steph combined, the fact that 37 year old lebron is still doing what he wants against anyteam except nets, shows how overrated and pathetic todays nba is, you need KD to shut down LeBron, when there should be a new young generational dynasty team to do it
KING JAMES 💜💛
LeBron clutch and 1
I think 2022 gonna be a better year for the lakers :)
Monk is a keeper
Let go Lakers GG Kings
LAKERS IS SO STRONG
😬
this is a certified "getting old for this shi' classic"
LeMVP 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Westbrook's turnovers this game was a miracle
