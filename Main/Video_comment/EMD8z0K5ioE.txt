Cleveland Had The Better Team Arizona Had The Better QB Sooners Nation
This Game Sums Up Baker Mayfield Just Pressure Him And He'll Try To Act like he's a Real Man And Run And Game Over ....Just Remember a Man Can Win A Game When His Offensive Line Isn't The Best But Most Of The Women "QB" Need Top 5 Offensive Lines To Even Be Relevant....
kyler at 7:50 like “hey i’ve done that before”
this was a good game
Anyone reading this, ask God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost to show you what I’m trying to tell you and others.
I just love how Kyler runs like a angry baby
Im coming back to these games and I started to see it was not because of the defense the Browns lost. It's because Mayfield is not good enough. Period.
Donovan Peoples-Jones 5 targets 4 receptions 101 receiving yards 2 receiving touchdowns 22.1 Fantasy Points!
Kyler Murray 20/30  C/ATT 229 passing yards 4 passing touchdowns 25.8 Fantasy Points!
Peoples Jones is an absolute unit. He had a great game.
Cleveland really fxcked up
😂😂 baker bs bruh hella fun to watch doe on soul
Everytime john Johnson get a interception, it also called back.
Imagine the dude your supposed to tackle, holds up the ball at the 9 yard line, and when you have a perfect tackle on him you miss and he scores.
loser
Everybody fast forward to 6:00!!!! Then pause at 6:04!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOO
Kyler for mvp
So they just forgot they got 2 of best backfield in chub and hunt..
Mayfield is the reason teams seem to put a lot of pressure on the Browns. He watches the pass rush more than he looks down field. There are places to go with the ball.
Baker mayfield 😂
제한카
OMG WYATT TELLER CHIPPED VON MILLER INTO NEXT YEAR  IT'S  A HIGHLITE FILM. BBBBBOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxgcMrJxDGo&t=13s
gotta respect how baker just wouldn’t go down on some of these sacks
AZ nasty.. It's kind of like. Death by?
Cardinals or Cowboys who y’all got between the 2 teams?
Bro OBJ is trash 🗑! The man has no heart or grit! He a spoiled diva!
I love both baker Mayfield and kyler Murry cause well *cough* ou fan *cough* and I love how It's a win win for me because I like both guys.
Hats off to Robert Alford. Bout to add a #23 jersey to the collection.so happy to see him bounce back from 2 year ending injuries back to back. Dude is a solid piece of that secondary
Respect to JJ Watt
browns suck as always
This assistant coach is a better play caller than then our head coach Kingsbury
Well I tell you what That Baker Mayfield all he Did in was Make Costly Mistakes and Penalties and when Baker Mayfield Runs he Runs like twinkle Toes and Runs Like a Fairy when he cant get rid of the Football I am glad they are not letting him play for Thursdays Game Lets see what will happen.
Thank for watching your video show cardinals game
Is there anyone who is throwing a prettier ball than Murray at the moment? 😍 So fun to watch.
Time to fire this worthless D cordinator.. This guys is a complete waste of money 💰💵
Kyler’s UP NEXT BARRING INJURIES !!!!
The cardinals don’t wanna play the Vikings they scared Lmao
The drunk hurricane theoretically float because factory impressively jog midst a magenta drink. secret, female fertile font
1 Corinthians 10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
Arizona so fun to watch. A lot of speed on offense and a good defense, this team is dangerous
Anyone think the Cardinals will do the same as the Steelers 2020?
We shall see how good they are when they face a real team...like the Packers.  Go pack go!
Old Odell woulda took one of them catches for 6
Baker holds onto the ball way too long, way to often.
Cards are due for new uniforms.
Hate this announcer!!!!!
Why do refs never have to atone for their blatantly bad and nonexistent calls?
I gotta tell ya, the vaunted Cleveland Browns defense couldn't stop a halfway decent college team. What is up with them?
I love the cardinals... gotta support the home team
Stay healthy Murray it may be your year Bro
Which nfl team has an active fullback?
Cardinal's need to get off their high horse. The NFL is rigged. No way the cardinal's are better then the Rams or Bucks.
Murray has been hot this season
I always liked JJ, but my respect for him grew tons going to check on mayfield, after his amazing sack and didn’t care about the fumble.
Why do the show the replay for holding but not for touchdowns
The graceful children clearly offend because chair angiographically please below a languid linda. tight, damaged fine
Mayfield needa be traded give us raven backup qb
this game was a lot closer than what the box score showed. looks like a bit of a blow out but a couple less mistakes by the browns O and they would’ve been in that game. gotta give credit to AZ defense tho. they play a huge roll in why that team is still undefeated
Can we all agree that mayfield is holding the browns back
Man the browns look that old team that they use to be.
Why TF is Arizona so loaded on offense and defense !!! As a die hard Ravens fan I don't see us going heads up with them at all smh
That Hopskin juke was filthy!
Odell isnt the same player. I cant understand for the life of me why people were so happy when he returned. He looks like hes lost at least 1 step but maybe a step and a half. Watch him move and you just see how slow his cuts are now compared to even a couple of years ago. He'll be out of the league in 2 years or playing as the 3rd option at best.
I will say this, as a Browns fan I respect the way Arizona put it on us. Even at full strength I don't think we beat them. I'm happy for AJ Green and Watt so they can finally experience some success. I think they are the team to beat this year. I wanted JJ Watt to sign with us so bad in the off season not so much for what he could do on the field but what he brings to a team. That strip sack was beautiful what was even more beautiful is that his first concern was to see if our quarterback was okay 100% class act
I knew it! Arizona would Turn around this year! Arizona Fans Everywhere must've been Really happy
fix your officiating
Deondre really was the loneliest man in cleveland lmao
Browns fans after the 2020 postseason: The browns are arguably the best team in the NFL Browns fans now: Go Bucs!
Browns so bad as always lol
The hurt grandson scilly tour because denim pathomorphologically pinch past a frightened frightening full fumbling functional parsnip. internal, general gentle columnist
The battle of ou cardinals are stacked but baker isn't as focused as kyler
That was a bs call on PI!
Just send the Cardinals straight to the SB. They are bullying teams left and right.
I really wish we could run this back without injured players, including Chub obviously.  This loss doesn't count.  Haha.
Arizona's good, but they'll need to continue their play further into the season in order to be for real.
So happy for the long suffering Cards fans! You have a dynamic QB and offense and great team all around! Like the long lost NFC East of the past, you had great competition in honing your team in the current day NFC West!
The Browns have a terrible offensive line
D hop is the best receiver in the league
excuse me where is the ending
The Cardinals defense is INSANE!
Activate Fitzgerald once playoff clinched.
My boy Kiley is going places
I thought Hopkins said he was retiring last year....???? And I thought he was....
Kyler Murray should be mvp candidate
while every other team in the NFL gets to play another team. the browns get to play the refs 😒
dude we got some total dogz for players this year yard hungry i love it
The diligent bowling opportunely jump because clerk aerobically annoy round a godly caution. itchy, giant ruth
I can’t believe the cardinals are 7-0 that’s nuts    Well I guess 6-0 rn but will be 7-0
It's amazing how much talent the cardinals have on offense
GO ARIZONA
Cardizona Birds looking good this season 🤘.
That touchdown at 9:39 was disrespectively clean
AZ wide outs stacked!
Kyler's Face after the TD before the half was too funny
I feel like a lot of talk right now is on how much the Browns have underperformed to date. But the Cardinals have played 4 road games already, & they won all of them by double digits. They’re legit.
Baker Don t ask me for a contract period ill give you what you deserve based  On performance  Browns owner
Baker Wrongfield ? next year new QB? 🧐
Well, one season in the playoffs will tide me over for another two decade playoff drought. Also, JJ watt, you're a class act. Seeing you lean over to check on Baker was really cool. Wish the best to you.
LFG CARDINALS! #BeRedSeeRed
oo  all state km c.as good player seeing a different like oh jump field 1@🌟🤭
Man, the Texans screwed up with Hopkins and JJ. I live in Houston, now I'm about the Ravens. Cardinals and Ravens, I'll buy my bowl tickets asap
Didn’t get a chance to watch the game, but did cleveland just all of a sudden abandon the run, or did it just get shut down?
The browns pissing me off we started off so great but I really don’t care I’m just here for odell
it’s crazy how accurate Kyler is 🎯
Vikings fan but I enjoy watching the cardinals. JJ,DH,KM
Did Fitzgerald retire?
D Hop and Green isn’t fair
Ugh mayfield is so Mid
my boys
D hop move he put on the two defenders and took both they ankles 😂😂😂😂😂
7:24 This was scripted/fake. Cardinals allowed this hail-mary TD. First, watch the 4-man pass rush: They are weak, sloppy, not really trying to sack Baker. Then watch the pass arrive in the end zone: Only TWO Cardinals are in the end zone?? There's Three browns converging to the ball and only two Cards! Watch Cardinal #7...he *totally ignores* the hail-mary and just stares at the receiver as he catches! _None_ of the Cards go up to contest the catch! This was fake. Most NFL games are scripted entertainment.
OBJ looks slow !
who is the woman announcer?
Man the Cardinals are elite
WTF is happening with the Cleveland Browns now? Mayfield can't hold the ball, but more importantly, where is the protection from the offensive line? I've been waiting for the Browns to bounce back since the departure of The Cardiac Kids in the Brian Sipe era, although I loved watching my Oakland Raiders going on from the Ice Bowl and defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl back then! Still, I believe that the Browns have a FAR BETTER chance of reaching the Super Bowl than our Hopeless Lions! I like the Cardinals, but c'mon guys, you have the talent to do so much better than the last 2 games! I am sick 😷 of Pittsburgh always being at the 🎩 Top of the division!  And yes, I am happy for Baltimore, but the Browns NEVER go to the Big Dance. The time is now, Cleveland!!!  (Unless you're waiting for Detroit?)
9:44 how the hell you leave best receiver that wide open?
Cards can go 17 and 0 but will still loose in the playoffs lmao 😂😂 im already calling it......  Cardinals will  NEVER win a SB
If that kyler murray rushing touchdown stayed I would have won over $1,000 on two bets
The worthless hope ultrasonographically stay because trade methodically wail till a thundering drawer. ultra, spurious word
I can’t wait for the Cardinals/Cowboys matchup towards the end of the season 🔥 Talk about a high scoring game ..
Is there any doubt who the best team in football is right now? 6-0, averaging 32 points per game, and destroyed 3 2020 playoff teams on the road. Yes it's only 1/3 of the way and yes it's a long season but while the media fellates the Cowboys, if they played right now the Cards would win rather handily. We'll see where we are in 2 weeks when we play the Packers on 10/28. But sadly, I've been so jaded by this team for the past 45 years that I'm cautiously optimistic.
https://youtu.be/qwkeTzOI7So
Browns corners and safeties have no communication at all
Arizona Cardinals are 6-0 this season. Texans at Cardinals Next Sunday 4:25pm on CBS
At first I thought the O-line was just awful (it’s not good), but Baker is just missing throws :( ALSO…Browns better without Beckham Jr. not sure if it’s the pressure to give him the ball or what but it’s a fact.
Murray is only going to celebrate touchdowns pass when he wins the Superbowl
Pretty excited cardinals are looking great
Crazy scary to think, they've add Ertz! Rise Up!
Man my browns are back to there pathetic ways
Keep in mind the browns had 2 oline men out in this game.
The Browns season may be over. To many starters are hurt. I can't  blame them, they're hurting. If they had there whole squad  they'd be 5-1 right now.
Who cares
I just wanted to see if Baker or Odell is the problem and by just watching this game it seemed like baker. Idk why he doesn’t look for Odell as first option seems like he just doesn’t want to throw the ball to him unless he has to
Bucs vs Cards sb????
Damn right!! The Cardinals are on fire, and I’m not sure which team has what it takes to put them down. They just keep getting better and better every week!
I was at this game and Murray and the Arizona Cardinals are for real.  There was nothing The Browns could do to contain him. The dude is way faster than he looks.
1-2-22 😁
That run game really makes a difference for the Cards 💪🏽
Remember when the playoffs start the teams that you think are going to win are the ones who get knocked off first
JJ Watt, class act!
At 1:51 is the reason why if I’m Odell or the Browns I would want traded or I would look to trade him. That’s a perfect example of either No chemistry or Baker forcing himself to not give him the ball…in all to sum it up…it’s a waste 😂 and I’m a Steelers fan
Get OBJ tf outta there, Baker is an absolute joke
The Watt family is a blessing for the NFL.
🌸If you’re reading this … I wish you  JOY, PEACE, WEALTH, and DIVINITY  x 1,000,000 in every area of your life!🌸🌸 desejo-te divindade 🌸🌸 Ich wünsche dir Göttlichkeit 🌸🌸 te deseo divinidad 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
Like this game best game on Sunday
My Packers will eat the Cardinals on oct 28
Murray looked bored in the second half
I think the Browns should move on now from Baker Mayfield. He'd never live up to people's expectations from him.
All those brown fans just to see theyre team get dominated by us
In The Words Of Rod Tidewell Show Me The Money Arizona Cardinals
The game should have been 6-0 Cardinals to start. Third and goal from way out and they gave it up both times. That right there is inexcusable a blown coverage and missed tackles those scores killed this game for the Browns.
Been a fan since I was born, everyone laughed Our time has come To the SB!
Baker has regressed.
Man!! I wish my Steelers would have got J.J. Watt also. Can never have enough Watt's. Well We got TJ and he's great.
Arizona is getting tough to defeat this season and they have some great players too.
It’s cardinals year 🐦 really hope they get to super bowl and ace it they deserve it 😎 💯

👀I didn’t expect Arizona to be small, very fast & the best in the NFL RN
Hicieron ver a Cafés como el equipo mediocre que han sido toda su historia, pero mucho gracias a las tonterías de su mariscal de campo regalando balones estúpidamente y una línea ofensiva con demasiadas carencias
Mayfield should make these games W
Brown bags again soon?
Two OU Heisman winners.  Felt like college ball out there.
As a Saints fan I can see the Cardinals going very far but it's better they get their few losses out the way now as opposed to playoff stages. Shame Fitz didn't have a quality QB like KM during his years with them.
👣 football ⚽️
Meanwhile.. gas prices going up ... shortages of dock workers truck workers and democrats tearing our country apart. But everyone is happy because some guys with a football won an imaginary game. The perfect distraction
The Browns will be the Browns
This looks like me play madden on rookie difficulty 😂
7:49 you know how there’s Tom Brady when he puts his head down?… That’s Kyler’ equivalent. He look at the camera like that it’s over for the opps
O Cardinals e muito rapido no ataque
I! Wonder if... That white woman,who "cried" And "insulted" Kyler Murray!  When he decided to go into the draft, is feeling"ashamed?" About her Misandristic and racist rhetorical analysis of his choice and abilities to perform at a "professional" level???  Or? Is she on the"band wagon???"  I WONDER HOW SHE IS THINKING NOOOWWWW!!!
Time for BAKER to GO bro. He’s TERRIBLE, and when you have a TERRIBLE qb, you just CAN’T do much bro
Fake tell lie vision people did you know Tom Brady was born female
Browns playing so bad I can't even watch it :(
Damn wtf I forgot about AJ Green. Used to play my Steelers twice a year with dalton and them in Cincinnati
Go Cards stay hungry.
My family moved to AZ from St. Louis in 1960 so I've got a long history of bitter disappointment with the oldest team in the league so I'm Sssoooo excited to see the birds doing so great!!!! It's early in the season but my fingers are crossed and they are earning respect from teams and players around the league and that's a great START!         Go Cards!
Looks just like the browns from 2 years ago. Could not put it together with a roll of duct tape.
6:27 that’s  all you need to know about how the Browns feel about Baker Mayfield JJ Watt was more concerned about him being hurt then his own lineman and teammates!!!!! That does not happen if your quarterback is down in pain they are either signaling for help or checkin making sure you’re OK!!
All those people saying that the WO for the bucs or the cowboys are the best in the league I’m not sure the Green ,Hopkins, Kirk are pretty dang good
the cardinals look like a machine
Buffalo is for sure the best
Cowboys nation all day😎
Browns "we tried"
Thank you AZ Cardinals I bet on you and now have a new Jimi Hendrix Experience Songbook to practice.  I knew you all would win!  Great Team Chemistry yall Gel!   One last thing is for the NFL big shots.   Enemies of Freedom want yall NFL big shots getting caught up in politically correct nonsense all over the place on your website, which diminishes your credibility, character and consistency.   Nothing beats that personal experience of you throwing signed footballs into the stands and signing autographs for kids!   Kyler Murray please sign autographs for free for kids and fans its good karma and your most noble ideology as sports players.   Its a kids game so remember to sign autos for all kids and inspire the next generation of American warriors and dreamers!
Looks like Murray is playing at MVP caliber
A.J. Green used to give The Browns fits when he played for The Bengals.
wouldve loved to have seen some of the penalties... 10 called penalties in the first quarter i believe 9 by the browns. I was there and some of them seemed like bs, idk im sure its easier to see on TV
I guest the cardinals and bucs are going to the super bowl
Football fans are so fickle. I remember the days where the mob said both Baker and Kyler were busts. Then when they were said to be amazing franchise quarterbacks. All it takes is a few games for the mob to change their minds.
The cardinals will be a good team this year!
Kyler Murray looks terrific. As a fair weather Bears fan I’d trade him for Justin Fields in a heartbeat. I know not gonna happen lol
3:15 how in the world referee saw that hold ?? haha
Baker lost this game..two lost fumbles.
OBJ was like i got the ball!?! For his celebration. Brown's don't seem to have that team chemistry..on OFFENSE.
I keep taking AJ Green out of my lineup cause his play has resulted in either 4 points or 15 points……. Only when he’s on my bench does he have a good game. I’ve got Kirk too and same goes for him.
9:16 JJ Watt gets a strip fumble and immediately goes to help Baker, love that attitude from such a big name guy. JJ and Larry legend are some of the nicest players the NFL has ever seen
As a Cards fan: first of all, I'm glad we won. But second, if the browns had all their starters in (2 offensive linemen and Nick Chubb), i feel like this game would've been a lot closer. I was sitting here watching this and thinking "This doesn't look like the Browns". Hopefully the Browns can get healthy and improve their record because they are better than a 3-3 team. I wouldn't want the cards to play them again at full strength
I still Roll with the DawgPound# 🐕🦴
Bucs, Packers, Cowboys, and even the Rams in a rematch can best them in the playoffs
Browns are hard to watch
when u have aj green ( healthy) hopkins & own youngster kirk ............. Damn the pass offense ... Wish Larry also have some spotlight on it
Baker was completely ANNIHILATED by LiL Foot Kyler. Cleveland needs to start looking for a new QB. 🤔
Nick Chubb is a big difference maker
Can we take a min to appreciate the most underrated player on this team, James Conner is an absolute beast. He’s been an outstanding finisher, first guy never tackles him. He only get like 15 touches and there never easy schemed up plays like Edmonds gets. But he beasts it on every play.
what is going on with the browns i thought they were supposed to be good
Bruh pass to odell
Ive been a fan of the Cardnials since i found out about the team i was 6 im 13 now i knew loving this team would come in handy one day hoping they win this years super bowl
they’re losing against the buccaneers 🤷‍♂️🤣🤡
Hopkins is the most underrated wr in the nfl
Baker suuuuuuuuuuuuucks
even though I'm a Seahawks fan, I can honestly say that if the Cardinals can avoid injuries, they will go to the Superbowl.
I've been a Cards fan since I was a kid. My Mom and Dad were Cards fans since they were in St. Louis. I can remember Lance Allworth quarterback when I was a kid.
baker mayfield is not the answer. browns need to be looking for his replacement while they still have talent
Is Isaiah Simmons playing as Line Backer or a backup Strong Safety from Buddha Baker?
AZ BABY REPRESENT❗️❗️💪🏼❤️‍🔥
Mayfield is 🗑 …
USAA ANYONE?
I'm a Packer fan..im worried bout these guys...
reasons Browns lost: 1. Cardinals are just too good... 2. Browns defensive safety, corners are straight trash 3. Baker is the worst QB at break-down plays/scrambles amongst the young QB's dudes decision making is suspect as hell 4. Odell didnt make a key catch which could have help keep the moral up 5. coaches are running out of trick plays too keep Browns offence unpredictable, 1 reason is their QB is average at best another reason is they dont know how to use their WR and TE to help carry the offence so any day the running game isnt going good they get exposed
Kyle says " Only I can Throw Up a hail Mary " what the  Hell is Babe Babe Doing!!!!
Who can stop the Cardinals?
That move by Hopkins 😬😬🔥
Kylers play at 1.00 is an MVP type play
Remember when they were saying Tua was going to be better than Kyler? Lmfao
A.j green been ballin 😶💯
Mayfield isn’t simply stepping up...
cards really makin an impact puttin the league on notice👀👀👀👀
I won $2829,46USD betting on the cards!!! woo hoo about time I get a nice win, treated myself to a nice dinner and the rest of the money is going into a tax free savings account for my future! 🤑😃
MAKER BAYFIELD
They are who we thought they were? 15 years later I guess it’s true in reverse. Not looking forward to playing them later this year.
I know nothing about American football but even I can tell that hunt is an intimidating athlete.
Love to see aj green balling
The Browns will be the Browns
Every year you can tell early on who is going to win the Superbowl, and at the moment either of these 3 teams are going to do that  i.e. the Cardinals , Cowboys or the Bills and I am going with the Cardinals.
The CARDINALS are no joke - they have a roster full of all-star players. Definitely in the hunt for a Super Bowl.
KYLER MURRAY IS THE MVP AND SAY IT IN THE COMMENTS BELOW FOR THE PPL AT THE BACK
Aye can y’all stop 🛑 putting the picture for the video as the team that wins so I have a reason to watch
I'm a long time Bengals fan, but I still  love watching A.J. Green scoring on the Browns.  Who Dey!!
Colin Cowherd boutta have a field day with this one
Baker mayfield trash as always
Nah son deandre went off 😭
That People's dude be ballin!!
JJ Watt continues to be my favorite player. His stats aren't the same as he was when he was younger, but he's the first to notice that Baker Mayfield is down and hurt.
Browns tackle brushed Murray with his hand and FLAG !! Cardinals have a head to head sack and no call ?
I never seen this team just dominated each week on offense and defense let's goooo CARDS
DPJ....Go BLUE
Kyler Murray is the MVP at the moment.
Commentators aren’t the best
Phoenix probably goin crazy this year wish I was in town! hahah
Same ol browns
Mr Vance joseph is ready for a HC job now!
CLEbrowns have a lot of questions to answer, they head into a short week.
(Grudging Seahawks fan) Cardinals are looking to assert own'age over the NFC West.  LA, S.F., and Seattle are in trouble.  I tip my hat to the Arizona Cardinals.
Y’all put the last clip twice
And yet there's people that will still try to convince me that Baker Mayfield is an elite QB.
stopped the Browns on 4th down now and it's three times today stopped the Browns on 4th down now and it's three times today
I give up, the Cardinals are amazing.
Starting to really doubt Baker as a SB level (or even close to a SB level) QB. Lamar, Allen, Mahomes, Darnold, Herbert, & my boy Joe Burrow are literally embarrassing him Stat wise. Not to mention the offensive talent around Baker is considered better than any of those teams.   I think they should go after Watson however they can't afford him without a trade via Baker etc. Baker hasn't broke out as a franchise guy at all. It's been 4 years. I'd say enough is enough.   The turnovers are pathetic. Especially when your defense is lacking salary cap wise and performance wise. If your gonna put 75% of your cap into the offense you need a star at QB.
Let's let baker sit and go grab cam newton
BUFFALO BILLS SAY WE WANT THE CARDINALS WE WISH THEY PLAYED US ON MNF NOT TENNESSEE SO WE COULD SHOW THEM WHY WERE #1 DEFENSE N THE #1 OFFENSE N NOBODY IS EVEN CLOSE TO CATCHING US THEY WONT GET 14 PTS ON US DAMN I WISH WE GET THEM IN POST SEASON LOVE TO SEND EM HOME THEY ARE ON OUR HIT LIST KC LAST WEEK LAST YR THAT LUCKY HAIL MARY WAS ALL THEY HAD LUCK.... WAIT ARIZONA JUST WAIT AIR ALLEN IS COMING 4 U
While their division and my Who Dey Cats get better each week, the Browns especially via Baker and that awful non-existent defense look worse and worse.
Obj would look nice in a bucs jersey
Where should Beckham play next, he still has done much i feel like he has all the talent but time isn't waiting man
Can't wait till Green bay plays them
The Cardinals must be stopped...
Where’s everyone that said bad move JJ az is washed up
weird thing is that James Conner is now back to back seasons on the last undefeated team and he also changed teams
Steelers fan here The Cardinals made good teams look terrible against them, Browns are one of those teams, easely my super bowl pick impressive how they built this team so fast it's insaine
All you idiots mocking JJ for choosing AZ are looking real quiet right now 🧐
Love to see my team go 6-0 , having a great run in the regular season 💯
Wow….. The Cardinals are for real
https://youtu.be/jfyy5ETCzMk
He could have gotten the first down easily. Why run out of of bounds. i know its about longevity but still. Cardinals are good. But they can be stopped. Play better defense.
why are quaterbacks scared to get hit while getting the first down.
Liked watching AJ Green go off nice TD catch
Cardinals are going to come back to earth folks. They have a high ceiling granted, but what will it look like when they face a team that has answers for it? Browns and Rams are not those teams either just saying.
*https://youtu.be/XV4EayzulUw* 🖤🖤⬆️🖤🌎🌍🌏🖤⬆️🖤🖤
so Patrick Peterson is miserable in Minnesota...and Hopkins is comfortable in Arizona...how times have changed
Cardinals on rookie mode
The narrow butane suggestively delay because spike medicinally place atop a spectacular punishment. frightened frightening full fumbling functional, voracious flax
TJ Watt and Cam Heyward look forward to seeing you and your shoulder in the near future, Baker. 🟨⬛🟨⬛🟨⬛🟨⬛🟨⬛🟨⬛
This year Cardinals They don't joke,Contender for Super Bowl,but we wait iuntil week 10 or 12 to see. But now Cardinals is the Best in NFL
Baker smh how many fumbles
Arizona may have the best recieving core in the league. Let's argue!!
Joe woods need to go period..
Not so happy Browns fan here, but it is what it is. Lot's of respect to the Cardinals this year. I do hope your team can go the distance this year it will be fun watching it happen along the way.
Won week at a time. We are 6-0 and showing all the right stuff. That was a big win.  But we are 0-0 heading into next week against the Texans, long season. So far so good. Let's Go!!!
IF YOU A ARIZONA CARDINALS  CAN I GET A AMEN ?
“The Mayfield Mary”
This makes me want to see a Cardinals Ravens super bowl matchup
Mayfield is a BUST
Let's us ENJOY this 6-0 run  #Redzone
Hopkins is the best receiver in the nfl any other receiver would of went down on that that first score of his like come on give him his respect and he’s not even fast just to smooth with it
With the amount of Cardinals players and coaches out either due to injury or covid I really did not expect the Cards to win by such a large margin. What a phenomenal game!
What a pathetic excuse for a football team. I thought Cleveland came to play football and try to win. Man was I ever wrong!!
JJ WATT IS A GOAT!! Not only does he sack fumble baker but he is the first guy to go help him and see if he is okay and he is on the other team!!!! #BiggerthanFootball
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9XpCNwJVL4
Go Cardinal
Mayfield ain't a franchise QB
Baker looks like Brady when he scrambles. In that he's slow as heck.
If AJ Green can just be 80% of the player he used to be, with Hopkins, and now Zach Ertz coming into the mix..Geez! Not too mention Christian Kirk is turning into a damn fine WR himself.And their rookie WR Rondale Moore shows signs of being a beast.I don't think we've seen this team hit their peak yet.They're scary now, but 4-5 weeks from now, Ertz being incorporated, barring any major injuries, I just don't see how you'd be able to stop them.Kyler hasn't even been trying to run the ball this year.Just imagine if they add that back into the mix? This team has crazy potential on offense.
Why didn’t they show that one handed catch by d-hop? It was ruled as roughing the passer though and he didn’t get credit for that crazy one hander
Right when they got JJ WATT to compliment someone as dominant as CJ on the other side they have all the miscellaneous pieces got AJ green and #1 Kyler Murray who stretches not only the defense but stretches the life span of his offensive line they know they don't have to block TOOO LONG
jj real for that
AJ Green. We should have given him a multi-year deal.
🧘🏾‍♂️
"He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32 Jesus Christ died on the cross for us all my friends, he is our Lord and Savior, and there is no salvation without him. Please, confess him as your Lord and Savior now! Believe in his death and resurrection on the cross, and that he died for your sins. Jesus is returning soon, REPENT, and believe. God Bless you all
Mayfield is so bad 💩💩💩
give christian kirk like 2-3 years he’ll be one of the best in the league lmao
This guy baker is a problem , his scrambling head down missing wideouts and and easy check downs to gain 5 yard, terrible decisions
Sorry Cleveland the Baker Mayfield project is over he's holding y'all back
JJ going to this team has very very solid effect on the whole defense. They are looking very good on both sides of the ball. The NFC West ughhh xD
Wow, THE CARDNIALS ??? Good luck to them and ending the longest drought of winning a title in all of Sports, not just football: 1947 !! Go Cardinals and I am a Cowboy fan !!
why the browns jerseys look like a tootsie roll
I am truly impressed and happy about our defense! They pretty much held the browns to 7 points if it wasn't for the Hail Mary. Haven't been this happy As a cards fan for a while.
Tired of hearing about cowboys.  Cardinals are serious ...does anybody realize they have Hopkins and aj...aj is literally the closest to Julio.....barring the injuries he was literally like the next randy moss. And they just added ertz from my eagles. No eagles than I got the Cardinals...only team challenging then is in their division the Rams...cowboys are faking and I think will start getting hurt.
Cardinals 16-0 this season I am calling it now
Who Dey?!
Vote Ja'Marr Chase rookie of the year! Watch Chase's block in that game. Beckham does not block on run plays.
7:06 why did they change the font on the clocks?
And the cardinals are still getting no respect from any of the sports reporters it’s crazy it’s always the other team lost and not the cardinals won
They force that ball to Beckham. Burrow doesn't force it to Chase, it comes naturally with their days at LSU.
.. if Kyler was on the Browns they’d be Undefeated💯
Ravens cardinals super bowl
7:49💀
Baker needs to get out of cleavland
lol the knowledge Mudra lotus pause meditation celebration at 3:00  lol
I think that we can save time and send the Lombardi Trophy to Phoenix now.
This game is proof of how far Cleveland still is from become a Superbowl contender
Thom brennaman
And ole butterfingers Baker....
arizona just got zach hurtz too...crazy offense
omg aj green and hopkins is op
This game shows that football is STILL won in the trenches..
Browns had practice squad tackles and it showed. Atrocious defensive scheming too. Casuals just want to pin it on the QB because that's all they can comprehend
Despite this, my Cards have as many primetime games as they have losses this year. Smh
we arent talking about 3:23 enough. Juke of the year so far
Cards are a better football team that the Browns. On both sides of the ball..
The Baker serving up turnovers. Get’ em while there hot and fresh. Buy one get two free
Chicago Cardinals from the Southside of Chicago
7:09 backup NFL tv graphics? Never seen that one before!
This is why Baker was a walk-on and Kyler was the #1 QB recruit.
He’s a Baker, of course he create turnovers.
What is joe woods bringing to the table? anything? If odell cant catch balls that matter, he isnt bringing anything to the table. If the tackles cant block they are not bringing anything to the group. If the defense cant defend they suck. this team has to clean up things on offense defense and special teams. I dont understand how a team playing a sport in a hotbed of american football like northeast ohio can just play so poorly on sunday. What are they even doing?? Do they even want to win??
Ugh…the Browns😔
I am a die hard Cowboys fan living in Arizona, and I have to tell you, no body is giving the cardinals any respect, it’s all Cowboys bla bla bla! the cardinals are the team to beat in the NFC.
Remember when the Browns were supposed to win the AFC North, make the playoffs & Baker was going to be in the MVP discussion?   That lasted 6 weeks but on the brightside that's a new franchise record...
Yep exactly how I figured it would go if Arizona got a lead. And let the excuses fly but every team has injured players now the fact is Baker can’t carry this team or any team really. He’s Dave Kreig when he’s good he’s great but he will rip your heart out with turnovers and bad plays
CLEVE IS A CHOKER. LOOK AT THE FUMBLING THE INTERCEPTIONS AND THE KILLER PENALTIES. ARIZONA SHOULDA BEEN A 4 POINT FAVORITE MINIMUM.  MINIMUM. CAESARS WINS AGAIN YOU DOGPOUND DOGS.
My Vikings missed a 37 yard field goal in week two to win the game against the cards and ended up shanking right. They held the browns to 14pts and somehow still lost the game. These teams aren’t as good as they think they are. Let’s see how the rest of the season plays out though👍🏼
Go cards
I ain’t even gonna read the comments 😢
Gotta love JJ Watt. Makes a strip sack and instead of overly celebrating this he immediately goes to check on Baker Mayfield who was obviously in pain. Just the best dude in the NFL
Baker ..... you SUCK! 😂
battle of the last two Sooners Qbs, but kyler murray is too agile too mobile and makes great decisions.
JUST HOW DOES A SHAKY 3-2 TEAM GIVE A 5-0 TEAM 3 POINTS??  I BORROWED $$$ TO BET ON ARIZ. THE ODDSMAKERS SUCKERED EVERYONE THIS GAME BY MAKING DOG CLEVE THE FAVORITE. SUCKER BET AND EVERYONE I KNEW BIT. BUT ME.
JJ watt, respect 💯
Had Odell wide open on 4th and 3 @2:05
I love watching my team win, but it seems like every week our defense takes out a couple players on the other side. It’s not fun to watch people getting injured so often.
Cardinals are what the browns supposed to look like
The Cardinals have been absolutely ready to play for all of their big games so far!  Kudos to Kingsbury for being prepared for them.  Let's just tighten things up against the teams that are more easily overlooked.
now yall fw the cardinals smh I knew what was gon happen when hopkins got there.
Baker is a terrible quarterback lmao
I am a Steelers fan, but I am not quite sure that is pass interference on that first interception???  Looking at you refs.
war eagle 🦅
How does AJ Green only have 8 TD's against Cleveland?
Cardinals have been epic. They can finish what Kurt Warner started. Cardinals won in LA before and can do it again, if you know what I mean.
JJ Watt love you man tha respect that you have for tha game and tha people who play is remarkable
What in the world is up with the cardinals this season!!?
This announcer sounds like a little kid when he gets excited.
https://youtu.be/p2CwomUfyxc
We need to go to the Super Bowl
You can check it, cardinals are the only team that beat the Rams
They should really play back up players in the 4th quarter. Especially with a large lead.
We are the only team that beat the rams
Im still not going to call playoff or SB, there are still alot of games to play, alot of the season left. Its a question of can they stay fit and keep the momentum?
The cardinals are dominating
We have chance
Let’s goooo 6-0
Hopkins … oh my goodness 😱
The class on j.j. watt to check on baker. love it.
Great.  Another week of listening to the national media clowns asking "is this team for real"?  Keep sleeping on AZ & K1.  You'll learn.
I swear the ref was in the way
OBJ needs to leave ASAP
Aaron Rodgers say he own Bears. What's Big Ben record vs browns?
I think Mayfield should be traded, I see what going on. Something you can't HIDE watt's. STOP DEFENDING PEOPLE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT.  People don't like Mayfield because of his personal life. You can't make me. You're throwing the race card in his face.  THIS IS A BLACK MAN SPEAKING. .
Wow Browns should talk to Mayfield and Beckham Jr or trade him because obviously the chemistry isn't there at all im just saying 🤷🏾
So stoked for the Astronauts man.  6-0 goddamn.
Bro WTF have they gave to the Cardinals OMG
I don’t like Odell and Baker together
I’m a ravens fan if we keep this up we could make it to The super bowl man what a fun match cards vs ravens would be
77% of these comments from Cards fans. Where u at Brownies??
I like listening to their announcer better than the boring romo
murray is great
Cardinals has a good defensive 👏
AJ Green and DHop on the same side of the ball, wtf
3:45 Cleveland #66 with one of the worst plays of the entire season 😂😂😂
Baker had 3 turnovers (2 fumbles and 1 interception). He's got to play better. The Browns should be better.
Odell Beckham Jr is overrated
If im Cleveland im calling Green Bay immediately and asking what they want for Rodgers. Would work out incredibly for both sides. Rodgers replaces Adams with Odell/Landry and replaces Jones with Chubb/Hunt. Defense and Offensive lines of Cleveland are both better than the Packers too. If Rodgers could win a Super Bowl and or MVP for the Cleveland Browns my god his legacy would skyrocket. Even with only 2 Super Bowls at that point, those would be two of the most incredible Super Bowl runs and both would belong to number 12.
Those Dirty Birds loom pretty good this year
Those refs screwed the Browns over and over again. Hey Baker keep yur pie hole shut or every game will be like this.
As a Bengals fan it stings to hear AJ Green's name called in another uniform, but I'm glad he's still getting his name called.   Especially against the Browns.
Thank you  Kyler. Arizona 5 and 0 WOW! Kyler Murray is 5'10".I knew he was a franchise qb and a special talent when they drafted him. Last time a 5'10" NFL quarterback was Doug Flutie. He was better than good.  Flutie to Moulds was one of my favorite combinations of all time.
Bad editing. Fox camera angles are terrible as well. Video looks like a high school teenager made it.
Ouch😬😂. Shout out to them Dudes in the Desert thoooooo because maaaaaaaan oh maaaaaaaan they are moppin up the competition, but make no mistake the Browns bear themselves today too between HORRIBLE 3rd Down Conversion, fumbles, 4th Down Turnover in the Redzone etc etc....
The tidy reminder preoperatively avoid because teeth fascinatingly heap circa a brave grill. tangible, amuck baseball
AJ Green still nasty!   ….from a Bengals fan!
Baker cannot lead Browns anymore
Nah d-hop got me weak wit those moves he a beast
@ 9:12  That’s why I like JJ Watt! He isn’t celebrating his sack/fumble, he’s worried about Baker……it’s more than a game y’all!
No question about it... Murray and the Cards are the best team so far...
Cards have so much firepower
The chiefs struggled against the browns and there guys just annihilated them.
Welp, just another day being a lifelong browns fan. You know, it's not even THAT we lost..
No Chubb , No Dub!
Good to see people waking up and not sleeping on the cards
Crazy how they have landry and beckham but people jones is whose putting in the work
Clowney has been a bust
People's Jones is a beast
This is Superbowl Cardinals Status. Powerhouse team
.... Bom man
We ain’t going to da super bowl  Ion kno why y’all keep saying that . Playoffs maybe if we’re lucky and stay focused . - cards fan
i AM GONNA SAY IT NOW KYLER MURRAY IS BETTER THAN LAMAR JACKSON AND I'M A STEELERS FAN
Kyler Murray is better than Baker
Baker just isn't that guy
I wish we would get to play the cards this year ps from Independence Missouri so chiefs fan cause they would shut us tf down on offense probably and would run over are defence it would either be a shootout are how this game looked with the cards winning
Are the ridiculously bad officials part of the highlights?
The Cardinals have an interesting formula. Don't just look like the Oklahoma sooners offense. Make the NFL into the rest of the BIG 12 conference.
9:07 that is sympathetic!! Thx Number 99
The two Oklahoma QBs finally face off.🤩
Let’s see how many dummies blame Baker for the Browns losing and not their shitty defense.
Yo... the way Mayfeild went down after JJ Watts hit him, i thought his arm had come off! That's a tackle reaction worthy of premiership football(soccer)!
“No surprise we do have a penalty”
Mayfield just has some really bad games
Mark my words, in the end Cardinals will lose superbowl because of Murray's vanity.
I always say there are too many great teams but super champ just only have one.
Browns are terrible. Odell sucks
Browns line sucked
Kyler murray is a beast 💪 😳
edit buff
The Arizona Cardinals are clearly the best team in the NFC!
God bless
God bless you
God bless don't forget to keep God first
Josh Rosen was worth it 🙏🏾
The Cardinals play like this and NBC would still rather have the bum ass Steelers and Seahawks on SNF than the Cards
Browns D gave up 84 points in the last two games---hard to win that way.
Baker is trash 🤣🤣🤣
Soooo baker turned the ball over 3 times and again was outplayed by a younger QB
baker should watch film of Kyler Murray and learn something
AJ Green + D Hop + Kyler Murray = the Trinity
Damn wait till zack ertz play there receivers going be unstoppable
Been really impressed with Murray as a passer this season so far. Both him and Jackson seem to have settled into that, not just bootlegging on every play.
(3:24).....WHAT A YAC FOR HOPPKINS☝️😱
Hopkins now you see him,no you dont. Oh no he was wide open.
https://youtu.be/kNsQQQu1YjU
Reminds me when Skip and Shannon this past week did a segment called Who's the best team in the NFL right now...and they didn't even MENTION the Cardinals. That was just unbelievable in my opinion... AZ is really good and the crazy thing is it doesn't even seem like they're going full throttle
That Cardinals vs Cowboys on Nov. 25th in gonna be a really really good game!! Popcorn is ready!!! 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Baker Mayfield is playing pure Asssstastic football rightnow.Straight trash 🛢🚽
T.J Watt bats the ball down J.J Watt bats the ball down T.J Watt forces a fumble recovered by the d J.J Watt does the same  These brothers are just unstoppable
I don’t get the browns, they have two really good backs but they like to drop back and pass alot
The Browns look flat.  Deflated.
With how good the cardinals are it’s make it more impressive that the Vikings shoulda beat them with that missed FG. Still cards are the top team as of right now
Feel like Mayfield should of tried a little harder to convert at 1:48. A different game could of played out if they got in the endzone on that drive.
11:43 damn machines altering the matrix again
I seriously doubt Buddha understands that touchdown celebration at all.
I’ve been saying it since last year Kyle Murray and Cardinals are SuperBowl contenders. They have a lot of talent
Browns got down to the 10 yard line not once but twice and walked away with zero points!  Come on man you can't pass up on points like that.  At least you could have kicked a field goal.  Yeah okay 6 points from that may not sound like much but you would have had 20 points instead of 14 and that would have at least kept you competitive late into the game.  Browns just didn't look very good at all.  Not taking anything away from the Cards--they are great this year--but the Browns should have done better.
Uncle Colin gonna have a field day today. And he won't be wrong.
PERFECT PLAY!
He called d hop the lonliest man in cleveland😂
The Watts are balling this year. Really happy to see hard work pay off.
Another solid performance from the cardinals. Must say Cleveland look a much improved outfit. Green Bay on Oct 29th for the Cardinals looks a worth a watch
🔥🦾☝🏽
This Browns defense is suspect and Joe Woods needs to go back and look at this... 40+ against the Chargers when they were up by 14pts and now the Cardinals
i love the browns coach on the pass interference call... "uncatchable" ... dude, youre player caught it
Definitely a winnable game for the browns just to many turnovers.
Cards are actually what the Rams is after they beat the Buccs. Rams went all in this and last season but still unable to get the first seed. They are doomed for another failed post season until they can stop the Cards.
The Browns need Landry and Chubb bad
browns defense really showed their weaknesses this game. Makes me worried about the film for this game. Other teams gonna totally take advantage of our crap safeties
It is very interesting to see the Cards, they play really good and they deserve to be considered as a real contenders, good for the Cardinals!
Can people comment on who they think what NFL team has the ugliest uniforms.
Man I was not expecting AJ Green to have the kind of impact he is having for the Cardinals. Thought it was a dud signing by the Cards but boy was I wrong.
The striped bath summarily close because german usually chew behind a ahead uganda. careful, broad point
As a lions fan I miss the crap out of Prater. Hope he gets a SB
Yet another QB bust for the browns 🤣
No Kliff; No Problem!
The Browns are a slight above average team. When they play the Elite teams, we get out coached, out played. 6 losses out of the playoffs. halfway there and havent played a division game yet? Just wait till next year, we be paper champions again.
Not.....really a big fan of Murray he feel to me like an extra running back and instead of trying to learn how to be a good QB he thinks run first and I don't how long that will last! He waits for a play to break down and looks for an open guy that just doesn't work very often!
I’m so tired of baker mayfield dude is so inconsistent..he turns the ball over more than there’s fouls…he tries too hard and that’s gonna get him a job for Hulu advertisements..like we were the team that could’ve beat this time but he is so selfish he wants to be a highlight soo damn bad..take care of the ball yo
I remember the first week he caught a TD,I stated how proud I am of Aj Green and that I never thought he was done.I got grilled in the comments,so every now and then I'll go back to those highlights and I will check and seif anybody is still there 😆
Still gotta beat Brady when it counts
The browns should trade Baker for Watson
Waiting for people to start having Cardinal swag on their cars. Let the bandwagon begin.
Just think about it, if the Vikings had a consistent kicker they would’ve beat the Cardinals, making them one of the best teams in the league.
Browns will never win a Super Bowl with Baker Mayfield.
Baker is a backup,no more
Damn the Cards are really bringing it of both ends of the field this year.
How well I see Murray playing in our system, the worse I feel Rosen and the betrayal of him by the GM and team in his rookie season with us.
It's games like this that make me wish the Cardinals were still in Chicago.
To this day i still question those experts and gms that think it's a good idea taking baker #1 ahead of lamar/allen
Mike Ryan in shambles     MURRAY!
Games after games I keep saying it ‘’ the Cardinals are a problem ‘’ and they keep proving it
Baker mayfield is terrible no offense
the bowl the browns going to, is the toilet bowl brown fans..
JJ Watt = True Professional! Strip sack, no celebration ( acted liked he’s done it before ) and checked on Baker…❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was a beat down.
This passin attack by cardinals is unfair
First time I've really watched Cardinal highlights this year. Murray looks like the REAL DEAL. Here's the successor to Tom Brady.
Hopkins in Hills face on the touch Down grab in the first..probably saying he punked you dude...you were no where even close to defend that pass...thats the difference between the pros and the wanna be's
Baker is not it for the browns
Saw Cardinals Team on sideline ... look good!
Ever thought about how the browns lost to teams that start with the letter C?
Early in the game, the browns defense was giving out TD's.  Then when the defense suddenly stepped up and made great stops, the browns can't get in the end zone.  Yeah, they are going to lose this game and not it the entertaining kind like their chiefs and chargers loss
On a Previous Cardinals Highlight video that they were gonna punch a Ticket to the Superbowl. Some Awesome Human Being said "Its only week 4 Kid, little early to think about a Super Bowl" kid ? Kid ? KID ?!?!? Where is this guy at now ? Week 6 and the Cardinals are decimating very good teams like the Browns. They are getting better every game, they are meshing every game, Kyler Murray is a Boss and their Defense is NASTY !!! This wasnt no pushover Browns team of years past. This Browns team has been to the Playoffs and is Loaded in their own right, but the Cardinals just took them to School and gave them Homework to do for entire week !!! I loathe the Arizona Cardinals, yet i was Born, raised and reside currently in Phoenix, Arizona. I know a Championship Caliber Team when i see one. This Cardinals team is Something Special and are a team that is built for a Couple Year Run for the Super Bowl Perennially. Time is Now and they are showing it each and every week.
man I had no idea Jadaveon clowney was still in the league
Baker is dumpster juice smh
Shannon & skip will just brush the conversation aside as if the nothing happened
yall notice that the font of the clock at 7:05 is different at 7:09 🤔
Cards-Bills SB. I called it in week 2! Go look at video for proof.
As a former denizen of Houston I am so happy for J.J. and Deandre. Too bad Jedeveon chose poorly. And wow! This week I get to watch J.J. and Deandre and the rest of the Cards deal the Texans another whuppin'.
Yall i feel so bad for houston next week. JJ and dhop against houston? jesus just hand us the Dub already JJ gon be a monster next week
It would be koo if cards make it to the bowl but sadly Brady wont let that happen remember that lol
Cardinals, will y'all do me a solid and win a playoff game with my man AJ Green? He deserves it but my team could never get him there. An NFC championship will be even better.😁
Cards team might be good or something..
Skipp..baker is average...lmao Thia game proves that point..100%
Browns fans: Respect.  I don't know how you do it.
It's weird to think Cardinals are the best team in the NFL as of rn. Bittersweet moment y'all 💪🏼🔥🔥🏜️ #birdgang4life
Bengals fan but I'm happy for Green, hope he gets a ring finally.
If the Cards make it to the Super Bowl they should bring back Larry Fitz for one game.
Mayfeild was really throwing a temper tantrum lmfaooo what a little kid
100% respect to Watt after that strip. No celebration, immediately turned his attention to the downed player.
Cardinals and Bills super bowl would be nuts
Odell needs to request a trade asap! He was open for a first on back to back plays baker didn’t even look his way
Baker taking on two roles today. Brownd QB and Defence dispacher
cards and suns!
I love how the Cardinals are a bunch of players other teams couldn't bother to keep- J.J. Watt, Deandre Hopkins, James Conner, Zach Ertz, etc- and they're schooling the NFL with a bunch of castoffs lol.
Poor Baker mayfield, he doesn’t know if he wants to run or pass the football, and when he tries to run he loses the ball to a fumble…!
Get rid of Baker, he’s goosed.
Impressive win. Rams and Cardinals are going to be fighting each other to that finish line this season.
Baker sucks so much. The weakest link in this team
Luv watching the browns lose
The way Murray looks when he runs makes me PIST
Bei mir heißen die Cardinals immer 'Cheap - cheap'
The cardinals offense looked bored  after they scored the first two TD’s 😂
Please, more plays and fewer "celebrations" in the highlights.
Mayfield wont win you many games, but he will lose a few for you.
Why stefanski keeps letting Mayfield throw 40 times and stops giving Chubb the ball is beyond me, browns need a qb, the cards may win they're division...
The cardinals right now is like when you adjust the sliders all the way to the right in madden
All I got is 1 question. Htf was kyler backing up baker he clearly is light yrs better and u can see poise in  kyler good luck until u play my cowboys lol
Arizona looks scary right now, but for Cleveland Peoples-Jones has to be WR1 at this point he can’t be stopped.
So far the only things that can actually stop the Browns offense this year are turnovers and failed fourth down conversions.
Browns D needs to be called out
I’ve been a card fan for 8 years now if feels so good to have a reliable D
Cleveland gotta stop going for it on 4 and take the 3
Unpopular opinion. Browns were actually on track to have a comeback prior to Baker getting hurt. Browns defense stepped up and stopped the cardinals on like 2-3 drives in a row with browns offense on the momentum.
CARDS vs Bills in the SB????
Funny now watching Cardinals dominate, but I swear whenever Kyler first got there everyone was chewing him and his coach out.
Dont forget last years steelers though... So dont over react on the cardinals yet
All I can say is WOW!!!!  IF the CARDS don't get to the SB this year, Everyone should be FIRED!!! LOL
‼️RISE UP RED SEA‼️ 6-0
Baker just gotta let the ball rip bro to many sacks
The cardinals are my favorite team and I lived in Arizona we are undifferentiated
I just watch Cardinals highlights cause I miss Hopkins and JJ Watt
I hate that this game had to happen.  Love the former sooners players
damn that was a bomb by baker mayfield 😁
9:47 Ted Mosby has entered the chat ...
This game shows Chubb should be talked about more often. Dude carries Browns offense HARD.
Baker thought he was Kyler Murray when he fumbled tryna scramble like that 😅😂
So much talk about the browns defense but i dont see it, only played good against rookie Fields...
Fitz wya
OBJ dropped his 2nd 4th down catch in 2weeks….
Bring back the chub! There seemed to be some big hits in this game
K. Murray is my new quarterback the guy is the truth...
I think on the INT Baker expected Higgins to run another route.
BLACKS WE ARE HOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH
I guess imma have to testify for whoever that was people-jones murdereed today
Imagine when Ertz starts playing 🤐
You're telling me AJ Green played 9 years in the same divisions as thd browns and scored 7 Tds against them? That whole time?
This cardinals team reminds me of the 18-19 chiefs. With a talented qb and stacked offensive team. If they keep working on their defense they are the biggest contender this season.
NFL expert team strikes again with their picks.
Its always nice to see the Browns suck ass and loose
Browns actually thought they had a good team this year. Baker Gayfield blowing again. Should work in a gay bar throwing drinks not footballs.
Cardinals literally scoring on every drive and punting like once a game
Larry needs to come back give the man his ring
Monday- is Baker an elite quarterback should he be paid. The browns not living upto preseason predictions, what's wrong with them. Oh the Cardinals 6 and 0. Now about the browns trouble's
Tried ta tell ya. These AZ boyz going to the SuperBowl this season!
That open field Deandre hopkins might be one of the best td's ive seen in a long time, what a move
James Conner 🙏🏻💪🏻
Baker is not good enough. Browns might want to seek a replacement.
With both RBs hurt Browns fans are going to see why most aren’t sold on Baker.
Baker doing baker things
Arizona lit up #26 on Cleveland. Damn.
Said it last week, saying it again this week: The Cardinals have figured it out. They are scary good defensively and offensively.   Whichever NFC team that meets my Bills in LA this year is gonna have to go through em. Either way, I'm gonna be sweating 😂
Imagine being JJ Watt in March and being like "I know this team is gonna go 6-0 the first six games of the season, but I can't say it in public cus everyone's gonna think I'm crazy" lol
Can one of us NFC WEST TEAMS GO TO A SUPPERBOWL?     HERE IS THE CATCH NO PUNT INTENDED🏈🕵    WIN ONE!!! WE HAD FOUR THAT we SHOULD OF WON   1 CARDS & PITTSBURGH...card fans what sb was this? ty Two sb 47 49ERS&RAVENS THREE SEAHAWKS&PATS LOL CANT GET ANY CLOSER.....WAIT!!! I FORGOT SB 54 TEN POINT LEAD LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CHIEFS&49ERS  DAM IT RAMS ITS UP TO YOU ALL BUT I THINK THE CARDS MAY HAVE ALITTLE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT GO 9ER'S!!!
Cards and NFL fans let's start a petition for Larry Fitzgerald to come back to the Cards!
Brown’s get a QB and they’ll be alright
Nick Wrong, Cowherd all took the Browns cuz they're sleeping on the Cardinals.And the Cards embarrassed another great team. We are looking really good this year, Murray is getting better every year, D-Hop and the rest of the receiving core are doing their thing and defense is getting stops when they need to. Second week in a row they stopped a team inside the 5 from scoring. Go Cards.
shows how good the niners actually are with a hurt team,  barley lost to these guys and they are 6-0
That whole stadium was chanting obj; only idiots say that he's the problem
Cardinal's are going all the way 2 the big show this is our year 😊😊
Just so that everyone knows. Cleveland were favorites to win this game...
The cowboys actually they can beat this team lmao
Mayfield is gonna have to reconcile with the fact that he's gonna have to use his feet instead of chickensht moves out of bounds on the 15 yard line.
Dam the NFC is stacked this year
Sigh, JuJu was right, the Browns is the Browns..............
Can my dawg Odell please go 2 a Superbowl contender type team!🤦‍♂️
Vikings had these dudes beat in AZ but you know they do Vikings things
Why murray was unhappy in the second half ? Bro baker is not a #1 QB there is a big gap between him and murray.   Imagine murray with obj
ARZ pretty much is playing perfect ball nowadays, HOWEVER 7:25…. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE⁉️ 60 YARDS AWAY (CLE):  🤷🏻‍♂️ARZ IS RUSHING 4, With 3 GUYS on OTHER 40 (20 yards back), 1 GUY ON 31, 2 Guys on 25? And I’m guessing 1 guy inside the 5… NO CLUE WHY JUST 1 GUY BACK⁉️🤷🏻‍♂️.  I don’t hate rushing 4, IMO it’s smarter when there is LESS TIME & should result in a pick WITH PRESSURE 💯 %  👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼THE PROBLEM 🤦🏻‍♂️‼️  HOW DO THE TRIP WRS (3 on top) BEAT ALL BUT 1 ARZ DB  INTO THE ENDZONE 🤔😬😧⁉️⁉️⁉️  AT 7:33 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼 🎯ALL 3 of the WR’S FROM TOP BEAT ALL BUT 1/CAN ARGUE 2 Defenders from ARZ TO THE Endzone‼️⁉️🤷🏻‍♂️. 1 ARZ GUY  IS DIRECTLY FACING THE BALL, TRYING TO COVER 3 GUYS HOPING HELP ARRIVES SOON!!!! LUCKILY ANOTHER DB IS ARRIVING AND TURNING WHILE ⭐️ 🎯👉🏼 ALL 3️⃣ WRS ARE ALREADY IN ENDZONE WAITING FOR BALL TO COMEDOWN! 💯% .  🤦🏻‍♂️👉🏼‼️ REDO=> ⭐️CALL TIMEOUT⭐️ (HAD ALL 3 LEFT/ BELIEVE HC WAS OUT/NOT THERE?). 👉🏼 KEEP THE 4 DL RUSHING STILL ✅ (4). 👉🏼 USE AJ GREEN FOR SURE 6’4” & 2 OTHER GUYS STANDING ON GOALINE FROM THE START (3) => 7!  👉🏼 2 GUYS playing 20-25 yards back (Other 40) incase of bubble screen=(9). 👉🏼LASTLY 2 guys around the 10/One on each hash to cover Left and Right! =>11 . (Shading to one side on deep route, backup coverage on bubble screen to run up, LASTLY TO BACKUP TO COVER BEHIND THE 3 GUYS ALREADY IN ENDZONE.) 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼. CARDS FANS: Take a screen shot at 7:25 and another at 7:33… you will see what I’m talking about!!! In a playoff 24-21 Game, 4th Quarter, NO TIMEOUTS that’s your season if they replicated this! 😬😬😬. Good learning experience for a nearly perfect team THAT WON REGARDLESS! I would bet any CASH THEY DO NOT GET CAUGHT AGAIN THIS SEASON, & ANY RETURNING PLAYERS WILL NOT GET CAUGHT EITHER NEXT SEASON ON THIS!!! 💯🎯! (SORRY THIS WAS LONG, BOTHERED ME THAT SUCH A GOOD TEAM COULD MAKE SUCH A DUMB MISTAKE?)🤷🏻‍♂️
Crazy to think that Myles Garrett had only one sack on Kyler, even when he had more time to sit in the pocket and throw the ball then when Danielle Hunter chased him down 3 times in one game.
The Cardinals are a serious team.
Cardinals vs. Ravens in the SB is my prediction. Sorry, Voncos and Tampa Brady.
Keep Doubting Us! #ShockTheWorld
Landry > OBJ
all by design. The WWENFL
Aj Green n DeAndre Hopkins are the deadliest Duo wide receivers in the league
someone really gotta break his legs and arms. this kid doing erthing a qb supposed to...thank god they aint in my division
As a Texans fan it so awesome to see Hopkins and Watts on a great team. Much respect for what they did in Houston despite theissues outside their control
Here come the bandwagons
That's domination.
That mayfield hailmary and that hopkins move to make it in the endzone were sick
Now they about to be unstoppable when zack get there.. they better win it all bc this team is all around put together
Just destroyed i am proud of these cardinals
Cardinals 6-0
Yo these comments. 6 games deep and yall already crowning the cards? They're a contender but y'all need to chillax.They are the one-third of the season champs there's no chip for that 😆 and better damn hope murray stays healthy to even have a shot at it
I’m tryna understand, are the Cardinals like Super Bowl contenders or do the Browns suck
I thought CLE would be a top contender for the AFC crown, but they're just out there falling all over themselves in a helpless manner.
Cards are clearly the best team in the NFL, not even close
Kyler Murray is something right out of Marvel Comics.
The Cardinals are cracked at Fortnite my guy
2021 Arizona Cardinals, Super Bowl contenders.
Cardinals are officially the new chiefs in town
Browns are overhyped
I like how it shows them getting stopped at the end of the game twice.
I'm happy for Aj Green glad his Career didn't die away in Cincinnati and he's healthy for a change.
Browns vs rams super bowl and lions go 0-17 thats going to prove to u idiots thats its rigged once and 4 for all!!
Last two games showing Cleveland has some problems on defense, albeit against some of the best teams in the league.
What was baker high on
Now I know why j.j. Watt picked this team.
I busted out laughing "He was the loneliest man in Cleveland"
When you look at Kyler Murray what stands out immediately is that he threw four Touchdown passes and no interceptions. Pretty damn good.
Man it's hard being a Brown's fan sometimes.. It just seems everytime OBJ is actively playing that Baker and the offense sucks. There is a pattern going back from 2019 until now.
JJ Watt knew what he was doing signing there
so they wait until poor Larry retires to make a decent run. I miss Larry. So fun to watch. Deandre is a nice addition to fill that hole. Now I wouldn't say Deandre has better hands, those pillows on Larry were unbelievable. But if any current player is closer in style and performance, it would be Hopkins.
idk why but get the feeling Bills vs. Cardinals could be possible
everybody gonn be a Cardinals fans now 😂 where my real Arizona Natives!
Hard to believe the Vikings were a missed field goal away from beating the cards, but didn’t do anything against the browns.
Odell overrated
😂😭😪y’all see why coach called a draw last week against the Chargers @4:44 bruh where is he throwing it to and why…..
My team is struggling right now 😩 c'mon Browns get it together. We are better than this. Gg Cards, y'all have great team.
How many times did the browns run it ?
As a cardinals fan I'm not even surprised this is expected. New fans we welcome yall with open arms
Living in Phoenix, AZ I can tell you this city is pumped up for the cardinals!! True die hard fans here for sure!! Respect ✊ 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
7:34 Damn the Browns were so bad today they somehow managed to lose a point on a Hail Mary.
Those highly viewed networks will still only talk lebron cowboys & Tom Brady tomorrow unfortunately. it okay though #RedSea BABY!!!!
Believed cardinal won this game that even be through the season of next year headed to a think of superbowl game that been cool cardinal did do that 2022 the far away fromed it to that been amazing quick exact unused gonna be there blank glance on page
Does everyone see that Baker sucks now???? Lmao 🤣
I think the Cincinnati Bengals are better team than the Cleveland Browns right now.  The Browns are probably a 7 or 8 win team and probably won't make the playoffs.  Baker Mayfield may not get the huge extension that he was seeking.  The Browns might be looking for a new QB next year.
Fuq BM ehe day😂
Cardinals ain’t played Tampa Bay yet and plus everyone has to go through them to get to the Super Bowl
*Better than the Kurt Warner & Larry Fitzgerald Cards??🤔*
@11:45   Double clip
So happy jj is part of a winning team. Could never get it with us 😔
D hop was a good acquisition for the cards
Zach ertz not gonna lie they don’t need him necessarily but hes gonna be a good addition all around
I’m Miami dolphin and cardinals fan. I never been to Arizona I just liked their colors from the first madden when I was a kid.
JJ checking up on Baker after that TFL
Man, Green isn’t the same as he was a couple of years ago but he’s one heck of a number two option.
Obj needs out he’s open and not even looking his way
I've been telling people for the last few years that the Browns would go back to being the Browns sooner or later and their delusional fanbase would deny it every time hahaha.
Go Cards
Korean power! Kyler Murray
I am offering up my qb, Baker Mayfield, to any team who will give us a draft pick. any round. any team. please take him.
Good to see Baker have another crapy game
Annoying RADIO play by play
AJ Green resurrected
Kyler pesci! Murray a straight assassin out there mvp!
We don’t even got Ertz yet🥶🥶🥶
Both sides of the ball....hell yah!
Can not wait to watch jj watt win a super bowl 😁
TEAMS WILL NEVER LEARN TO STOP GOING FOR IT ON 4TH DOWN AGAINST US
Aj green is back
so no one noticed Peoples Jones run over a man to score a TD
Why are the cardinals called cards ? Like playing cards
Dam, cardinals have the most weapons ive seen on offense since when the rams had the greatest show on turf. Stopping them from scoring is nearly impossible.
ALL #1 PICK HEISMAN WINNERS NOT CREATED EQUAL SHOULD'VE BEEN THE TITLE💯
Cardinals Cowboys week 16 looking real juicy
NFL is rigged. Watch it in slow motion he fell for the juke move on purpose and the other guy slipped on purpose. 3:20
17-0
Jesus Christ! Are the Cards of all teams gonna go undefeated? The freaking Cards? 🤯
Browns should've kept Manziel.
Shoulda had 🖐🏾tds
Many analysts picked the 49ers or Rams to win the division, little do they know these cards are dangerous.
The Cardinals are looking crazy good this year, but let's not forget the Steelers from last year. Don't get too over hyped.
Welp that's it fellas, the disappointing seasons r up Bowl here we come #Redsea💪🔥
This was a good old fashioned country asswhipping.
they have hop, aj green, watt, kirk, edmond.... jeeeeez. stacked nfc teams man. tryna be the golden state warriors over here same as the bucs
7:50 Kyler is like not on my watch lol lol and after that look the Browns never scored again on this game.
Mayfield played like garbage!
May these Cardinals beat Dallas in the playoffs! 🙏🏼
Not having but it's still early in the season and I've seen plenty of teams start undefeated only to to fall off. Not saying that it'll be the same store for the Cards
What happen to the Browns defense and Baker nowhere near the top talent players win game for home field
They got a hell Mary and still lost by 20... Arizona finally has a team that is legit and built to last
I took the Cards for this one because I think Mayfield stinks. But, man, the Cards look like a Juggernaut. A great QB, good run game, solid pass rush.
Zach Ertz on the sideline today like… 😎
Tired of people sleeping on the cards
Ok sooner fans who wore it better? J/k it will always be kyler
Cardinals # 1 FAN
Go cardinals!
This cardinals team is 🔥 But kyler face @ 7:50 lmao
Here's a thought🤔...the Angry Birds are playing out of their minds, huh? I'm a Bucs fan, but game recognize game. Much respect on their season & record thus far 👍...bonus thought: I guess that Bruce Lee fighting spirit is working...🤨opinions?
Lmfaooo browns proving once again they're just Off season champions... NOTHING MORE LMFAOOOO
Chargers fans last week after beating bum baker lead browns!  AFC goes through us! Lamar lead ravens 34-6 Cardinals fans after beating bum baker leads Cardinals we on a mission 🤣😂🤣 Can y’all win y’all division first? Y’all was on a mission last year I thought 5-2 how that mission turned out! 2 HOF WRs Murray is not my MVP! LJ8🐐MVP
@0.48 Murray dropping on the ball like that understanding the situation and not reacting On Emotion or try and be cute with the ball or be a hero...just following his training on how to handle this and how not too is very impressive for a young qb.
Wish The Browns could fine another Jim Brown God He Was Fun To Watch
I think we are looking at a perfect season
Theeeeeere's a Baker on the field 🤗 good darn job AZ #rallythevalley
The diva Mayfield really sucks
Good game Arizona Cardinals and tough loss Cleveland Browns!
that was a sick ass move man..
After watching this my 49ers might as well let Trey Lance play out the rest of the season to learn. Cardinals looking like a NFC #1 seed and the Rams look like the wild card spot.
good win for the browns, proud of those guys
Baker Mayfield definitely has a hall of fame of interception badge
My eagles just gave cardinals another weapon..I hope all win the super bowl...respect
Mayfield overrated!
Browns deserve a better QB. Mayfield is not consistent at all.
2:43 I can already see Chiseled Adonis’s commentary Oh I missed😂
The guy Deandre Hopkins literally looks like Lil Wayne. Lol
A whole bunch of ppl were saying the Cards weren't going to play well this year claiming they'll only win 8 games....
I like how when baker was on the ground hurt watts the first to check on him
Disrespectfully my cowboys gnna destroy them them mfrs💯😂
The Cards are legit! Kyler’s got that Sooner Magic powering him. Baker seems to have the Pokie State curse with severe fumblitis!
Baker is trash how does that dude have so many commercials?? What has he done?? Nothing maybe if they take away the commercials he plays better.. the guy is out there thinking about being on set rather than winning dam games
you remember how the steelers went undefeated for a while last season and fell asleep in the playoffs? that's all i have to say.
As much as I love my Cardinals,  they were assisted by some trash calls but we would won regardless because of our defense
Baker Mayfield played horribly today.#notafranchiseQB
that should be phrased D-hopped, he broke two defenders' ankles, he should've never made that 2nd touchdown, amazing
Looks like the announcer just learned the word tiptoe
Poor Baker had a shocker
Sorry to say it but Browns with Baker is a mediocre team.
The Browns needed this home game win?
6-0 and they said Murray wouldn’t succeed as a nfl QB
Man the Cardinals are stacked on both sides of the ball they just blew out a good Browns team on the road they're for real
They just look like they have 12 or 13 players each play they're so quick.
Tons of great wrs on the field
Baker is a trash qb.....the browns should straight up trade him and odell for deshaun watson and a pack of tissues......He plays like a blind man who does not knows there are opposing players trying to sack him.....Thats the #1 overall pick the browns wasted
Cardinals are a lot of fun to watch, rooting for them to make the Super Bowl
https://youtube.com/shorts/N8r8UG9QDAY?feature=share
Can't believe Robert Alford is still starting for the cards
Man DeAndre on 3:22
I think cardinals have a chance
I've been a Cardinal's fan since 87/88.. as exciting as this team is, and impressive their current streak is, it's not about the regular season record... *It's about finally winning the Super Bowl* #NoExcuses
2020 Steelers vibes
Cleveland being Cleveland!!!!!
Play where Watt sacked Baker and play was still unfolding, he only cared about making sure Baker was ok…immediately called for trainers for him…hes a straight up gangster but true example of sportsmanship the way it should be…respect ✊
i never seen someone as small as kyler murray play the QB position at this high of a level. if i'm missing someone please tell me? Kyler is listed at 5'10
If Larry doesn't come back, I want him back as a coach maybe WR coach. He'll get his SB shot somehow.
All you sports talk show hosts....Please start giving these guys credit.
Let’s hope Murray doesn’t wear down over the course of the season…. Otherwise, Cards look good
Im not a browns fan but I wanted them to win
Nice to beat the Browns. Even more satisfying after hearing that Browns stadium sound like ONE GIANT infant crying.
Cardinals, Rams, Packers, Bucs, Cowboys. Best teams in the league
Colin will have a field day roasting baker & the browns tomorrow
Donovan Peoples-Jones 🐐
Browns fans like to complain about the offense. But their defense is brutal!! Can’t win giving up 37 points
Even two years ago, there were a lot of people who said that Kyler Murry wouldn't be successful because of his height. but If we still had josh rosen...
I've been turned off by the politics of the NFL but I do love to see the team of my State looking so good on the field. Phoenix is the place to be I tell ya.
The Cardinals are to be reckoned with no matter who they play. They have a great roster.
3:39 IS ALSO WHY BAKER IS HOLDIN THIS TEAM BACK
Browns with Baker Mayfield = Rams with Jared Goff. As long as Chubb and Hunt are scorching the turf, he'll ball out. Otherwise winning gets tough. Coach stefanski is making some dumb decisions in the name of analytics
Cant wait to see TE Zach Ertz perform with the Arizona Cardinals. Super bowl contenders for sure 👌
1:46 IS WHY BAKER MAYFIELD WILL IS HOLDING THIS TEAM BACK
we won with half of our defense as backups and with out our head coach
We've got some really great teams in the NFC this year.  Murray has the teammates to use his skills - he's like an alien with his instincts.  Tampa will challenge them. And Green Bay has also developed an offense that's maybe as good as the aforementioned.  Long season, but I can't wait for the NFC Playoffs.
Baker tries to do way tooooo much
They gotta beat the Packers saints and bucs and cowboys first
Madden ratings are horrible this year. Brady 99 and Murray is 85
Beckham must be hard to find
show the same replay to times at the end
Cards vs bucs NFC championship
So we’re not gonna talk about that DeAndre Hopkins catch in the second quarter?
Rams fan here, I know my eyes didn't lie, my squad lost to the #1 squad in the league, my Rams are nice but the Cardinals look all time great.
I'm officially a cardinals fan
3:18 that was smooth
Odel sucks
Browns still a good team lol why is everyone overreacting
Go cardinals
Browns need to fix their defense and offenses look horrible
Peoples dude was making people in az nervous.... glad we pulled this out
🤬Im sick of the media hyping up the Cleveland Browns and L.a Chargers....no..there Quarterbacks are not ready🤬
Did the Cards h-whoop that ass or what? Ass whoopin mo fockas lol 😂😁😁
The Buffalo Bills will kick the Cardinals ass if they happen to play them at any point during the off-season.
You got to trade odell, baker is to focused on him that he's holding the ball to long
Cards are literally Red Hot.  I can't be the only one who has the creeping call of "Perfectville" in the back of their minds, right?
I'm loving the Cardinals
We keep giving the bird to all our haters. 6-0 Let's goooo. AZ Sports are blowing up keep doubting our beautiful state and players.
You won me alot of money twin ❤️
They look scary good.
9:12 JJ Watt Sacks the QB then takes his helmet off to make sure he’s okay. Character.
JJ going to check on Baker 9:14 good guy always
cardinals and they fans can suck it.
Just realized they have Zach Ertz. 🤦🏾‍♂️
I told you Cleveland fans during the week that you can't win when you are forced to rely on Mayfield's arm.
Call me an internal optimist...and all credit to Arizona, they are playing at a championship level without doubt. But how many injuries can this Browns team suffer before imploding? We definitely found out today...this is a team, at full strength, that is really just at the cusp of greatness but when you start removing major pieces, they quickly go back to mediocre and we, unfortunately, saw that today. I'm not giving up but I'm also concerned with the alarming rate at which our major players are going down...certainly if we have ANY chance in the playoffs (and even making the playoffs) we've got to get guys healthy. Otherwise it'll be a season of games just like this debacle...
Tom Brady will ruin the Cardinals perfect record
Baker's 4th down attempts were painful to watch. Man, they should stick to their identity, not every QB is a Rodgers/Mahomes/Herbert
The mistake by the lake is back!
Texans worst team of the last 3 years you get rid of bhop the you get rid of watt what that's a whole offense and defense in two players
Browns would be favourites if they didn’t have Fat Mayfield as their QB. So much talent yet wasted cause of fatty
As a Packers fan, I think I've spotted the team we're losing the NFC Championship game to.
How about them cowboys
As a Bengals and Texans fan, something about the cardinals just feels right. Like this is what it’s supposed to be like
The "experts" this week: tHe BrOwNs WiLl hAnD ThE cArDiNalS ThEiR fIrSt LoSs Of ThE SeAsOn
Cardinals are a good team.. but the BROWNS are Horrible on Defense.. Outside of their DL.. the secondary is probably the worst in the NFL... they have all R or 1-2 year guys...Harrison sucks really bad. I can do better than him and I'm 51 years old. Linebackers for Cleveland are also young and not that good. You can NOT go to the Superbowl let alone make the playoffs when your Defense is that bad.  Baker had another BAD game... Coaching is bad... this is the same Cleveland Browns since the expansion 1999.. they look like a expansion team on Defense and their offense is pass pass pass 75% of the time.. .and it's find beckham... find beckham. that's why they double him. He is actually hurting cleveland on Offense cause he needs to get the ball his direction.  Overall this team needs a team only meeting with some yelling at each other.. but who will lead it? They have no one to do so.. they are all young 22-25 year olds... Browns will finish 9-8 or 8-9.... at start of season I was thinking 10-7 cause I saw the defense was weak in the secondary.. but these young players are BAD
Cardinals D had Baker running
Browns banged up, Cards banged up. Kyler. Nuff said.
Lamar Jackson MVP.. Big Truzz.. Flock Nation!!💯 Another one
OMG, are they legit this year?
Tomorrow media will talk about the brown and how they should of won vs talking about how the Cards dominated this game even when they all said they would lose.
People under the comments saying “Cardinals putting teams on notice” … You dont think the entire league knows theyre Undefeated AND have Kyler Murray?? AND Deandre Hopkins. OH not to mention JJ Watt & Budda Baker along with a serviceable defense.. Yeah no one knew that….
Murray is criminally underrated.
That hail mail to close out the 1st half though. My goodness.
This team mad. Period. Playing mad. Madder than your team.
What a team , arizona rules
Great win cardinals, Let's go cardinals, and #Lets GoCardinals
What a damn game some of the best I've seen this year
Everyone who keeps doubting the cardinals is poop
Need the browns to trade Odell he’s being wasted
*I guarantee OBJ is open most of the time on his routes, I just wonder why Mayfield don't find him enough?*
Kyler Murray is the best QB in the league and possibly the best to ever do it and its not even close.   Who in the NFL throws a better ball than KM ???  Who sees the field better and throws the most appropriate pass for the opening ??? Who throws a better fade pass than KM ???? All his passes are where the receiver supposed to be in HIS brain at the point of his release....HE AUTUALLY SEES A SPLIT SECOND BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE and throws the ball where the receiver supposed to be in the real-time processing picture he has in his brain.   We are watching something never seen before in the NFL. A great example is notice when KM slides before a sack or hit, its like he sees the approaching danger a split second before it appears. Its like the play has already occurred in his head before it actually happens. Or the potential hit before it actually happens.  Notice all his throws are on point. Never too high, never too fast, never behind the receiver, never too in front of the receiver. If the pass requires putting the receiver in danger the pass doesn't come out of his hands. His mind computes under tremendous of pressure and sees a split second before that if he throws that ball the receiver can get hurt so he doesn't throw it PERIOD.  And all his balls are perfectly thrown. Check it out for yourself. People said he was too short to play in the NFL......I'm not too sure he will ever lose more than 5 games in a season let alone being too short and you can completely discount the ARIZONA CARDINALS LOSING A GAME THIS SEASON. Call me crazy all you want but I've seen the best to ever do it in my lifetime and what I am seeing from this gentleman KM, I've never seen this before. And everybody reading this post I want you to remember where you 1st read it !
when I first saw this schedule I said to myself this team will finish 4  13 I'm glad I was wrong.  This team isn't just beating good teams they are dismantling them the titans rams and browns I'm blown away I never dreamed they would be 6 and 0 at this point.
Beat The Breaks off them Boys 😂😂 love to see it Cleveland Fans
Cards look like a superbowl team with out a doubt
@9:08 JJ Watt gets a strip sack on mayfield but instead of jumping into the pile,he pulls his helmet off and checks on the downed fellow,It doesn’t get anymore sportsmanlike than that IMO.It will go unnoticed to most,therefor I want you to read this comment and notice it .
I still don’t know how the cardinals snagged number 4 Moore out of Purdue in the draft. Their offense is just unfair with him on it, dudes a legit next evolution of football player the way he accelerates and changed direction. Tyreek hill yet smoother and more polished.
Pathetic game, Browns. Truly pathetic.
I been telling people if Aj green gets back to being his prime self look out.
Notice how watt immediately takes off his helmet to check on baker after the hit. Class act guy!
Stephanski blows
The cardinals might have the best wr corp in the league. People forget aj green is an elite talent sometimes. Nuke, kirk, and the rest are just top tier. I cant think of another that matches their talent. Perhaps the bucs come close
❤️🏈❤️🏈❤️🏈🏆❤️🏈❤️🏈❤️🏈❤️ This Lady Loves Her Cardinals!
Cardinals are here to stay. They are making it look easy
Other then the Hail Mary at the end of the first half, that defense is looking really good. The offense really clicked today as well. This might be a bit biased, since I'm a Cardinals fan but I'd say they're a complete team. The defense is doing their job and so is the offense.
Man this offense looks unstoppable and we’re getting zack ertz next week
I hope the Cards win the SB. One of my dad's favorite teams when he was alive along with SF
Baker ain't it. Yes he's better than the browns usual qb but that's like saying you have eaten McDonald's all your life and suddenly stepped up  to Subway.
They lost but my browns fought their hearts out man, imistakes and bad calls and injuries, lots and lots of injury’s but that’s ball, I really like baker he’s got issues but I think he will lead us to the big 1
Browns are stinky :)
Bill O'Brian should have his name put in the Cardinals ring of honor for giving us d-hop 🤣
9:10 JJ Watt is a class act.
Cards are for real
Let’s Go CARDINALS!!!!!
Arizona is fun to watch. I hope Murray can stay healthy. He’s a chest code/video game. I hope Baker heals up, because he’s been playing pretty gritty with that injured shoulder.
The quick cut to Kyler after the hail mary to end the half 😂😂 the look on his face 😐
God damn cardinals are stream rolling everyone
1:02 DHop running up to the DB to tell him he’s little😂😂😂
Fun game
Browns might go 11-6 or 10-7
JJ Watt a class act when Baker got injured. Clean play, not his fault, still took off his helmet to check on him.
Mayfield is trash🤣🤣🤣
Browns need new QB
The browns made BIG mistakes against the best team in the NFL I believe they can compete with the cards however the cards just executed and capitalized as a top team should
I have to give it to them… they worked my rams over pretty good. Definitely a solid contender this year for NFC West
Browns vs Cardinals refs This was the most lopsided officiated game I seen you know bets was covered
Baker needs to let go of the ball seriously he has 11 and Odell Beckham he has playmakers
Browns line? Browns Qb? Browns Defense?  🤷🏽‍♂️
The 156 dislikes are browns fans
They are who we thought they were! And we "almost" let em off the hook
Conner fought hard for those yards after contact
Is his name People's Elbow, or People Jones? I will go by Man Brown for the purpose of this discussion.  What say you, Audience Smith?
Wow the way Bakers leg looked when Watt got him Looked scary
This AZ team has some serious Leichester City (Premier League title run) vibes to it.
Cardinals vs bucs will be🤯🤯
Gotta bounce back against Denver...if we lose to them then changes need to be made...defense is giving up too many free points and yards
Cardinals should have kept Reddick. Pass rush is the one thing they’re missing and Reddick is again playing out of his mind with sacks this year.
Why don't they show the replays in these highlights? I wanted to see the field view of DHop snapping the whole secondary's ankles.
*Kyler >* lamar
just imagine when ertz in that cards uni next week
I just had to say that was a classy move by JJ Watt. Respect.
Both favorite teams
Are we just gonna ignore jj watt checking  on baker mayfield?? What a nice guy!
Wow! Murray has a heck of an arm. Never seen anyone so accurate
I love how JJ Watt is silent the entire season and than goes off today like his wife and kids are depending on him in a hostage situation 😂.  The Cards need more of this lol.
*Baker is better at doing commercials than he is at QB !*
What I love most so far is that three of our dominant wins have been on the road
I wish Larry fitz was still playing for the cardinals since they are fr this yr 😩😩
0:46 Smartest play of the week; if not the season. Don't exacerbate the screwup; just take care of the football and make up for it on the next play.
How bout them Cardinals...damn Gina
cards ain't no superbowl contender. this luck will run out and they will be beat in their first playoff game
I wanted  too see my boy zac ertz  Play ....hope cards reach all the way too SB.... Flyeaglesfly
Never woulda believed the Cardinals of all teams would be the last undefeated team in the NFL this far into the season.
browns o line has left chat
I’m so happy to see my team do so good after years of disappointments I really see us in the super bowl this year and takin it
AJ Green giving free piggy back rides at 9:20
As a bills fan I have to admit the cardinals are #1 in the lead
Holy hell baker launched that Hail Mary (at end of 2nd QTR)
I had a feeling the cardinals would be good this season but then I said nvm since they start good and flop but damn these mfs are good
Now I have to wait a couple or more years to finally see the Browns beat the Cardinals it is written down on my bucket list I can't cross it off until God helps the Browns beat the Cardinals
Member when these teams struggled to score even against each other? Member when the Bills couldn't win a game against a half-injured team? Who have we left to make fun of now, the Jets?
It freaking sucks the injury plague continues to ravage the Browns this season I really wish God would protect them from getting hurt he can protect them from the coronavirus now my week just got even worse God said that he would make it up to me and he would help the Browns win Thursday night against the broncos and he would get them back on the winning Trail and he also promised me he would help the Browns make the playoffs every season until they've won a Super bowl championship and that's a pretty big promise he made to me
Browns had to open with their running game also
IN THE DOG HOUSE AGAIN! BAD DOG!  What A Pathetic Performance  Browns! 👎😠
They’ll get broke soon enough.  This is just a phase.  They are not a playoff team
Good game for the Cards. We were just missing so many weapons on OF and DEF.  bad timing. Bummer.
Kyler the most underrated QB in the league.
So what exactly happened to the Browns top 3 defense? Teams are now putting up 40 points on them
Kyler is better than Lamar....but the bills could beat this team
I love this two teams and raiders thats all and thats it
Kyler Murray showing what a Oklahoma #1 overall QB should look like.
Despite all the injuries, cardinals overcame them
It's rough being a Cardinals fan in the Florida Panhandle. I can't watch any games or even listen to it on the radio over here. Seems like all these channels want to show is the Saints, Cowboys, Seahawks and even the Jets! Instead of showing the only undefeated team in the NFL.
Somebody tell @MylesGarrett that Kyler Murray just rose from the dead and beat that a** 🤣😂🤣🧟‍♂️ #RiseUpRedSea
Can't stand these Cardinals games, they're over in like 5 minutes
The refs are making football no fun to watch. I loose interest more and more by the week.  I cant wait for another league to watch, this has become pathetic.
DeAndre Hopkins is an underpaid NFL player, no matter how much they pay him.
I love how D Hop showed up on that first touchdown just to tell the Browns to calm down. 😂
man chubb looked great today and he's so much better than Henry. dang hunt can't handle the workload either?
The Browns layed an egg, but *the officiating was still atrocious* vs the Browns.
mayfield did not have a good day at all
7:31-7:35 That Hail Mary was unbelievable!!! 😲
birdgang #1
I’m a cardinals fan now rooting for the Jets brings me nothing but pain
Baker just looked awful that first half. His turnovers gave them so much momentum and the cardinals are the last team to give a headstart.
Cards looking for their first NFL Championship since they were still in Chicago; 1947 I think it was
Woops, the cards won't meet the brady bunch until the playoffs. Great game.
R E D S E A
Cardinals going on their run for the decade. I swear  they’re always good for one year and then everyone forgets about them for a while due to mediocrity 😂
9:12 that right there is why JJ Watt was always one of my favorite players. Just a good guy even though he’s one of the greatest players of the last 25-30 years.
Best team in the NFL
I wish they played like this when Larry Fitzgerald was on this team
Cards fr boy...I remember they said Kyler wouldn't make it in this league when he was drafted.... now look at him ball'n! Never listen to the critics
Imagine if cardinals go undefeated
Hope we’re finally done with “Should we take the Cardinals seriously?” or “Is Arizona for real?” bullshit. But probably not. 🤦🏻‍♂
Good W for us. Sucks that it’s gotten penalty heavy earlier on and especially in the 1st qtr but we’re proving to everyone that we are the team to beat and why we have a legitimate claim to being a super bowl contending team. GG to y’all Browns fans. Very sorry for Odell and Hunt going down. Sucks that y’all are really banged up but I hope you guys bounce back and get to bring on the winning track. Y’all are a dangerous team when fully healthy. Best of luck to the rest of the season. #AZCardinals #RedSea #6-0 ❤️🖤🤍🏈
Man,these Cards are the real deal.They absolutely smoked the Doo Doo Browns.Im a Cowboys fan but I got to say the road to the NFC title game might be going through the Desert
Congratulations cardinals fans with being the only undefeated team in the league. You guys are awesome. And its coming from a redskins fan...hope you'll win the superbowl this year.
Why evertime a team goes undefeated for a while people wanna 🍆 ride 🤨. They just 6-0 relax pin heads. How are they super bowl bound already 😑??
The only thing stopping the Cards this year is possible injuries and that brutal schedule of theirs.  Otherwise, they are the class of the NFL.
Arizona is looking scary as hell this year , I wish they’d sign fitz for the rest of the year just so he has a chance to win 1 ring
Cards could go 17-0 and still won’t give them credit
Let's go Cardinals.💪💪🔥🔥
Cards have the mantle as best team in NFL, with Bucs or Bills 2nd
8:44 what a move
Cards not impressive, they will lose 2/3 of their next games. They have been lucky
Y’all remember rams last year was playing the same as the cardinals
Can we appreciate the fact that Watt was concerned for Mayfield when he was down, I just love sportsmanship.
3:23 yeah texans!! definitely don't want that on your team!
I wonder how Shannon Sharpe looking now after all them memes he was posting about Kyler 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
That move by D hop defied the laws of physics
Luckily I bet on the cards
Wow this GM for the cardinals and owner went all out getting an all star team with the best players of other teams
Browns getting cooked
Kyle Murray just keeps improving every week. I was a doubters because of Murray's size but I admit I was wrong. Dude can ball!
Benched mayfield 💀‼
Cards just won the game without there head coach Kliff, Rodney Hudson and Chandler Jones and they didn’t play Ertz.
Looks like cardinals are gonna be in the Superbowl with form like this but it's a long way to go to get there but they giving themselves a great chance
Kyler Murray MVP 🎉
Maybe it's me but Cam Newton would make Cleveland a much better team;Smh.
YES SIR THE CARDINALS ARE 6-0
One nation under media overlords.
I love Hopkins
Murray's "action" after his handoffs is pretty lousy.
Baker is..nvm 🗑
I guess the Browns weren't who we thought they were lol
Baker literally was saved by the fact that Peoples-Jones made that catch. He's been awful this year
They gonna blame Everything on Odel …
Got my weekly sighting of baby yoda
Well these are the same old browns a loss let's go Arizona cardinals red birds
Odell need to come to Green Bay. This mayfield clown isn’t utilizing him right🤷🏿. That’s like having adams and not using him.
Let's go red birds Arizona cardinals 6 0 superbowl run let's go Arizona cardinals larry Fitzgerald we need u come back and play
9:13 nice guy JJ
How tf they take a point away after the Hail Mary
Let's go red birds 6 0 in Cleveland let's go Arizona cardinals superbowl run let's go red birds 6 and 0
It's going to be a show down in the NFC playoff standings. I'm ready to watch it. Hopefully it's not rigged... Did I say to much??
9:09 Baker busted a Paul Pierce
Baker mayfield couldn’t rally his guys he played horribly he’s to blame for this loss
Let’s relax now cardinals started off strong last year too and after the bye just fell off
So who has Greg Prater on their fantasy team?  If you do I hope you had a good day.  GO CARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that was a helluva throw by Mayfield
The Cardinals have the Best team in the NFC'🤔🏈💯.
As a texans fan, Everytime I see hop score in that Arizona Jersey it breaks my heart😞
That hail mary by Baker was crazy
Is it just me, or do the highlights look sped up just a tad?
It's Case Keenum time!!  What the hell was Baker doing today?
If they play anyone but Tom Brady in the Superbowl they'll win it😂😂😂😂😂
Woah… Kyler looks good…
Cardinals are good, but can they beat playoff brady though🤔
This man Odell open almost every play and baker out here thinking he Lamar
Browns just stop now, no reason to play anymore.
GO ARIZONA CARDINALS!!! WoooooHoooooooo!!!
Well, that was certainly men against boys. Yikes, Browns fans....
Baker will forever be a solid 9-7 NFL qb...nothing wrong with that at all. I just dont think he will ever take a team over the top. A different version of Kirk Cousins ..may be wrong, I like the guy ..hope he does prove me wrong.
This has been one of the most exciting nfl seasons we've had in a long time and I thank God for that every day. 💪
*Steelers >* browns🤣🤣🤣
I hope we don't end up like atl
This is our year boys, haven't seen any real glory like this since we had Kurt Warner in 08.
Let's Go Brandon
Cardinals are playing like the chiefs when they were unstoppable
Baker Mayfield 🗑 he is Average at best lol Black Quarterbacks are just better 😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️
I’m not saying the pats cowboys game wasn’t entertaining, but I wanna see the cardinals in prime time or at least more coverage across the country
Heads up Browns, the Cardinals is just to good for us at this point
As long as the Cardinals beat the Bucs in the NFC Championship this year, i'll be a happy man. #DenyBradyHis8thPlease
Baker gotta to go just over rated
!!!!this is why JJ Watt picked the Cardinals let's go.
NOW will the Cards FINALLY get some respect? They are and have been for REAL. No luck, no accident. And they were underdogs, yet again. Really? Can’t wait for Mr. Rodgers. There will be no wonderful day in THIS neighborhood for the Pack.
Remember when tall couldn't stfu about the browns what happened???
This cardinals team is the best weve seen in 6 years
The browns need to just run the 🏈 Baker is not that dude he’s average at best..
Can't wait to see what reason people like Daniel Jeremiah and Keyshawn Johnson will have in hating the Cardinals
All these sports talking heads picked Cleveland to win the game. Sooner or later they’re going to to be forced to start taking the Cardinals seriously.
Best receiving corps in the NFL
9:19 is that Watt checking on injured Mayfield?
Chargers and Browns were spent from last week shoot out 😔
Helluva lot of tip-toeing going on in this game...
Class act from watt checking on baker
I think that Cardinals will finish this season with 16/1
If Cleveland browns had a top QB or better than Baker fuckfield they'd dominate.  There QB is beating them.  The teams solid clearly one of the best overall in NFL but there Shitty QB play has beat them in every single GAME LOST. IM NO BROWNS FAN BUT DAMN ITS CLEAR TO SEE!!!!🙈
that blown coverage on DHOP is brutal
#RedBirds aint playin with the NFL! Warner2009 Palmer2015 and now Murray2021. almost every 6 years we become SB Contenders!! COME BACK FITZ
That’s the super bowl cardinals 🔥
I love AJ Green's silent domination. Been loving him since watching him on the Bengals.
It’s alright browns going to come back better than ever
The Cards have a hell of a team.
And keep in mind they just got Zach ertz
notice JJ at 9:14 he doesn't celebrate. he immediately checks on baker and calls over the medical team. thats professionalism at its finest.
I think they better keep their eyes on the Cardinals.
I WANNA SEE THE RAVENS PLAY THE CARDS!!!!
Hahahah all the analysts and experts are literally weetordad
Damn?!! That wàs a quick beat down......
Cards Boys NFC chip
Holy Crap Cardinals just stomped on The Browns IN CLEVELAND without Pro Bowl center Rodney Hudson, starting tight end Mad Maxx, no Head Coach/offensive coordinator, no QB coach, Chandler Jones, 3 defensive linemen Zach Allen, Corey Peters and Rashad Lawrence, and with banged up corners. Just WOW! 🤯
The cardinals are a serious problem
Oh yes the return of the Cleveland clowns iv been waiting for you to return
Prater was on point today
Cardinals is the Steelers last year.😂
Baker's gonna get ripped tomorrow. Cue the OBJ trade requests
I know one team for sure can beat this team:  The seahawks
@3:20 d hop shows why he probably the best receiver in football and I’m a cowboys fan
The Grim Reaper got 4 Passing TDs today
So this Cards team just added yet another big target (Ertz) for Kyler . Good luck NFC
This thump will be loud !
Suns go to the finals and lose it all to a hungry Bucks team. Cardinals go to the bowl and lose it all to....?
Wonder how different this game would be if Jarvis and Chubb played
ESPN/Sportscenter🤡: Join us next week, on why the Cardinals still aren’t the best team in the NFL.
Glad to see my dude AJ Green balling out still !!!  - A Bengals fan
Give k1 the mvp asap
Murry MVP.
Browns season is over... Baker is a faker 🔥🤦‍♂️🔥
bruh Hopkins is so good
Ravens cardinals matchup would be soo exciting to watch. GG cardinals
this was an embarrassment for the browns & their fans.
There's my Cleveland Clowns that we know and love.
If they stay healthy, don't see anyone beating them, not even the Bills, and I'm a Titans fan.
I've been a fan since 1988 and I've never been this excited through week 6. Not even 2015 had me this pumped.
Browns D is overrated. Everyone keeps looking at the game were the played a rookie QB, whose coach was trying to sabotage him cause he never wanted em...... Every-time CLE played a real team, the QB shredded them so far.......
I’ve made this controversial statement before I stand by it...Aj green is better than Julio Jones
Trade OBJ and baker for deshaun🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️that’s what’s needed
Waiting for idiots to keep doubting the cardinals
Anyone remember when the browns started off hot and people were saying they were top team. lol me too. Schedule don't lie, anyone not a browns fan knew they were being propped up by that weak ass schedule at the start.
These commentators do not have good commentator voices
Once again. To all those non-believers or NFL experts that thought that Kyler Murray (this short man) could not play in the NFL..LOL. Keep eating some crow. Go Sooners..=)
Cant wait for Cowboys vs Cards towards the end of the year. Gonna be a big game for home field prob. Go Cowboys
Ravens v Cardinals superbowl would be 🌋💸📈
Colin Cowherd is salivating over this game.
Browns will always suck
Mad respect to watt after takling baker and taking his helmet off and kneeling near him when he thought he was hurt
I see Baker woke up feeling harmless today.
Too much injuries season is probably over for browns sadly...
Easy money, most places had the Cardinals +2.5, for some reason smh
DPJ
Shannon sharpe is going to cook Baker Mayfield tomorrow on undisputed
I hate the way that refs always call pass interferences whenever DeAndre Hopkins is involved in anything. In the Raiders game Bryan Edwards had to catch a ball with one hand cuz his arm was fully in the grasp of the defender no flag at all. The refs need to get on the same page
i ddnt c this game but would bet mayfield was trying to force feed it to beckham
Waiting to see what Uncle Colin has to say about Baker’s performance tomorrow..
Realistically, most of the penalties called on the browns were so stupid. That unnecessary roughness call was so BS and most of the pass interference calls weren't even interferences at all. Raps were definitely on the Cardinal's side for this one
Baker is trash idk how many times I see Odell open in front of him, but he never sees him smh
JJ checking on baker when he was hurt 🥺 what a nice guy
Baker got to go
That touchdown by the Browns before half time was amazing!
Its insane that nobody talking about the Cards smh!!!!!
Cards won me money.  However, the Chargers and Patriots cost me money...
1:11 Kirk is roided for sure lol
Gooooooooo cardinals
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin!!
OBJ HAS TO GET STRONGER, he needs more muscles it shows every year
Best team in the league that’s just facts🤷‍♂️
Best team in the NFL.
Mayfield is good, but not great.  There isn’t a GM in football who would take him over Murray.
I hope aj green gets a ring. Such a great collegiate and nfl player. Nice to see him off the Bengals
Baker just clearly ain't it chief. It sucks but I would not pay him cap shattering money
Baker is an overrated Has-Been!
People can crown the cardinals but the browns were complete garbage today
Cardinals looking dangerous this year
No one mentioning OBJ 😂
6 AND 0!!! 6 AND F****ING 0!!! LETS GO CARDINALS!!!
Red Sea Rising baby!
Ahhhhhh I’m jus loving all these comments being a cardinals fan all my life 😌😌😌😌
Whats going on with BmayFiellddd?????????
Cardinals vs ravens Super bowl
Baker with another stellar Baker-like performance.
It makes me laugh so hard to see Mayfield try to play like Mahomes.. I bet he thinks he is as good as Mahomes too lmfao🤣😂🤣
The Cardinals are for real, they have assembled a juggernaut on defense to go with a very exciting offense. They are going to beat my 49ers by over 30 points next time, maybe more!
Let’s Odell Beckam bash. So he drops every pass.
3:21 Dhop making another Case for naming him the best receiver in the league
No doubt the cardinals r legit but the browns without their run game is middle of the pack @ best. The chubb/hunt combo is their main weapon.
Browns had their chances, too many mistakes. Good job Cards.
Arizona has done some good work behind the scenes.  Put together a great mix of veterans and young players.  That D line is ferocious.  If that defense stays healthy, they're gonna be tough in the post season.
Can we discuss how odell is just a average nfl receiver
Without Chubb this team is unwatchable
Dallas will crush them in playoffs.
As I’ve been saying Baker is 🗑! he doesn’t deserve to be this team’s qb. The Brown & the Bucs have the most talented roster top to bottom period.
Daniel Jeremiah can keep pickin the opposition
I think Larry should consider on coming back now lookin like a super bowl team.
Happy for all the cards fan I hope yall go to superbowl!
Here's to y'all mocking my boy JJ for choosing the cards.
Cardinals vs Ravens I would love to see it.
Helen Keller=refs Vs browns
Hot take: Case Keenum is better than Baker Mayfield.
Browns are relapsing
Browns are relapsing
Yo u love AJ Green, that guy is back, there's nothing to say about DHop that hasn't been said, first ballot HOF WRs are rare, we are watching one for sure right now
Also, i remember people saying the Cardinals would have a tough game today.............................................................lol
OBJ one of the most overvalued players of the last 10 years
highlights of sad browns fans please!
Baker TRASHFIELD back at it again I see. 🤣😂🤣😂
My super bowl prediction is the Bills vs Cardinals
One QB feels dangerous some days the other QB is dangerous n don’t have to talk about it!
These cardinals ain't playing.
Not today, OBJ!!
Kyler went from backing up Jonny Manziel at Texas A&M to heisman playing at Oklahoma to playing at a MVP level in his 3rd year in the league. 🔥
All doubt regarding the Cardinals' legitimacy should be cleared.
Credit the defense for the win.
Cards are the best team in the NFL right now. No doubt
9:14 that's why I love jj ❤
Question...can the Ravens beat the Cardinals, that will be a great match up!!!
Our defensive coordinator stinks absolutely stinks, fire joe woods now! He is clueless!
Same old sorry browns  Faker mayfield is not the answer at quarterback Cleveland still don’t have a franchise quarterback trade for Deshaun Watson while you still can
Man the cards are really looking good so far this year I hope they can keep it up all year
THE BROWNS ARE GOING TO BECKEM TO MUCH THERES OTHER RECEIVERS GOOD TOO
Browns need another qb
Crazy how the browns and chargers both scored 40+ points last week only for both of them to get blown out this week
This receiver lineup is absolutely insane, they literally can’t not be open
AJ Green exposed greedy today damn
the browns secondary bro
Listen wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction(hell), but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life(heaven), only a few find it.Matthew7:13 Believe in God's son Jesus today, repent of your sin, dont be left behind. Love Y'all
3:22. This receiving corps man...
I saw Kyler Murray coming
Game manager Baker wasting all that talent the browns have I'm sorry y'all browns fans for Baker he just average at best
Every week they say so and so will be us and every week we keep winning
Are browns a super bowl contender? Yes but with joe woods and terrible play calling? HELL NAH
The browns is the browns
Quick shout out to JJ Watt. Didn't even celebrate that strip sack fumble recovery. Immediately took off his helmet and checked on Baker. Miss him big time in Houston. Still one of my favorite players no matter where he is.
Kyler is the Stephen Curry of football. I don’t even like Steph, but Murray is special and has revolutionized the QB position for miniature framed guys looking to start as pros. ✔️ all he needs is a ring or 2 and I smell a legendary DYNASTY out in cactus land 🌵
Respect to JJ watt for checking on baker
The Cardinals are the #1 team in the league and its not close imo
Bengals > Cardinals
Birdgang! We could be in the super bowl and they’d still be doubting us.
K1 is the best QB in football. Nobody better right now. Not Lamar. Not Herbert. Not Allen. Not Mahomes. Not Tom. Murray IS THE BEST RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT. ✔️ Kyler is the Steph of football
Mixed feelings that the Cardinals aren't playing the buccaneers this season. A mix between relief and wanting to see how they would play against brady.
*starts video with OBJ not being able to get the ball again* Me: *visual happiness* :)
https://youtu.be/txL9kpfDCcg
Dammit Browns. Dammit. That's all I am going to say.
I cant believe the Browns were favored in this game. So disrespectful to AZ.
https://youtu.be/nX9EGLtFCcA
Great win cards! Let's stay focused stay hungry. #birdgang #RiseUpRedSea
Juts like the BUCS, the Cardinals have some of the greatest trades of this decade 4 first round picks they traded for
Not having Chubb and Landry was not the problem.  Defense and QB are the problem.   Browns will be lucky to be at .500 by end of year.  What a massive disappointment so far.
I thought Cleveland would’ve put up a better fight than this, but maybe...Cardinals are that dominant
Announcer thinks everyone’s tiptoeing lol
The first td, Teddy Bridgewater misses that throw 9/10 goodness the Broncos are such a disappointment
These refs are on a mission 🤬🤬🤬🤬  I understand missing a call but this is getting ridiculous 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Cardinals Cowboys for the Nfc
Just wait until Zach ertz makes his debut for them😏
I’m sorry I I might be biased but Baker is just not impressing at all…Sign Cam Newton at least he can get away from a defender or two
From an Eagles fan, this Cardinals team looks like a juggernaut, and they're going to love the addition of Ertz.  They've smoked the Titans, Rams, and Browns, all on the road.  Even when something negative happens, they just roll right back.  They're better than the pretenders in Dallas who have beaten a bunch of bad or young QBs and think the 90s are back.
Cardinals still legit right? I know people still don’t believe in us still!
Been saying the browns were gonna get a reality check all week. These cards are dangerous haha
It's funny because lots of those midweek predictions had Cleveland winning....by small margins but still winning! GO CARDS!!!!!
The browns are the browns
Brown’s 🤔They faking injuries so they can get another good draft 🤣😂
I cannot believe I got sucked in again I thought we where good I thought we where moving up and the NFL Gods said no your the browns don't you remember you suck and on top of it everyone is hurt I can't help but just laugh I got teased again
Browns media tomorrow: we can't win like this.  Fire everybody.
Murray throws touchdown his face 😐  Murray runs for touchdown 🧘
So long Chiefs, time to hop on the Cardinals bandwagon.
I want to see a Cardinals vs Ravens Super Bowl. Kyler vs Lamar would be so fun to watch and it would be great for the league.
Coming from a Steelers fan here.... Don't get too cocky Cards fans simply because your team is still unbeaten. Trust me, I witnessed it all with my boys last year. 😞😞
Getting too many commercials
Cardinals>Ravens. Ravens are lucky they don’t have 3 losses tbh. Should’ve lost to the Lions and Colts, but the league won’t let that happen.
Beckham sucks
Someone is wasting money putting Raphael Warnock ads in my face.  I would not vote for this guy for crap.  You'd have to pay me two hundred thousand dollars to vote for him.
Better start taking the Cards seriously 😤
Here come the same old browns, there are 0 excuses.... none
The cardinals are destroying strong teams like the Rams and the browns but are barely beating bad teams like the Jaguars and the beat up 49ers.
Baker is killing this team! He's not the answer! He's case Keenan... At best!
3:24 I love how smooth this is. Unlike Steelers' run last season, these performances by Cardinals are so convincing
Where Colin was right
Hi
Why is everyone saying baker sucks? And then people are saying that the cardinals are gonna win the superbowl. So how would baker do good when playing the champions? He doesn't have Jarvis Landry or chubb. Yall are some clowns
Damn proud of my team. Just wish Larry was here to share in it
So now the Browns now how it feels like to lose to a team who's coach had COVID.
Lmao to the ppl that thought AJ Green was washed
Get rid of baker he’s useless
Man were the refs screwing the browns, they probably woulda lost anyways but when you get a roughing the passer when you barely touch kyler and jj watt doesn't get one when he push baker down late its hard to watch, not even mentioning some of the other calls. i wanted the Cardinals to win but it was hard to watch
arizona cardinals is not gonna go to the super bowl next year
Watt has so much respect for his opponents baker goes down after he gets a strip sack and he the first to say sorry
Kyler is mvp rn
Both RB’s out ✅ QB injured ✅ Refs out to get us ✅  O Line gives up half way thru plays ✅ Defense miscommunication ✅ Head coach looks like a chad✅ Must be the browns 😂
Let Kyler Kirk! I mean cook!
6-0 for Cardinals, Unstoppable. Murray for MVP!
baseball playing QBs are the future
Cardinals floor is 13-4. I don't wanna say anyone in the NFL is gonna go undefeated so I'll say the ceiling is 16-1
Bills vs Cardinals Super Bowl ?
Hopkins spectacularly "rock the baby asleep" .. Marcus G looks relentless for those BLK shds QB sack tries...Conner just runs through +5 relentless perks....and A.J Green ....🤲🏈 @100% being himself ok ...Game 🎯 Hopkins was just Swimming with the crew on the floor after🤲🎯🏈😏  Cardx set
baker being exposed no chubb or run game and this kid just overthrowing and getting sacked. Obj need to leave asap we know who the problem is in this team.
That man Schwartz is all speed and no hands or route running skills.
My Cardinals!!!
Man Murray has some serious touch on the ball
God kyler is a baller! This whole team is on fire 🔥
Baker isn't as good as Murray. 🙂
Baker mayfield is mid browns need to realise that
The Cardinals are that good no mirage
the cardinals don't deserve to win the superbowl tbh. Larry Legend did everything he could for the franchise for so long and they get rid of him once things actually start to look good. You can't do my man Larry like that.
OBJ= ol ball juggler.
You can't win games with Mayfield holding the ball most of the time.
Tampa vs cards?
Cardinals are the best!
Cardinals archilles heel: depth
Kingsbury out....Peter's out.... Jones out.... Hudson out.... Zach Allen out... to name a few and my Cardinals still dominate on all sides of the ball.
Browns suck and they lost because they suck but cmon with the refs.
I can't wait for Keyshawn's excuses for this one!
2:32
Kevin Kugler  CLE on FOX
Dammm.... baker played so baddd. He got benched!!!! Bro........
Man 6-0 feels nice
Cardinals need to lose because the 72' Dolphins said so.
That man people jones, they going to have yo increase his madden rating.
Browns defense can’t cover, give up way too many third and longs, and don’t take the ball away. Is it talent or a shitty scheme? After 3 losses where the defense looked live a sieve, I’m thinking it might be the scheme. I dunno. I’m just a frustrated Browns fan.
Edmonds..bolts ⚡🔩 out of there like, yoooo 😭🤙give me these yrds, next was that nice tackle/Sack/fumble by JJ, ..meann'...well,🤷🏿‍♂️that 🏈do get batted down 👇 from the Watt's angle so,..CB Alford like ..😭🙅🏾‍♂️nope @the end  Cardx set GG dudes
TAKE DAT DUB
Where are all my fellow Browns fans at?  I'm talking about both the OBJ nut-huggers AND the Joe Woods nut-huggers.  You pathetic CL0WNS have been telling me for the last four weeks that *I* am the "M0R0N" because I've been saying FOR TWO YEARS NOW that OBJ needs to be TRADED and Joe Woods needs to be FIRED if this team is going to have ANY CHANCE of winning a Super Bowl!  OBJ drops YET ANOTHER perfect pass from Baker on 4th and 2 and it costs us the game.  If he catches that and we score a TD on that drive, the score is now 23-21 and ALL of the momentum is on OUR SIDE.  But nah...OBJ would rather drop it and then walk off the field like he doesn't even give a $h!t.  He is the most overrated player in the entire NFL and there's not even a close second.  GET RID OF HIM!!!  And don't even get me STARTED on that worthless POS Joe Woods.  NEVER IN MY ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE have I seen a defense give up so many first downs on 3rd or 4th and long.  Joe Woods' defense gave up a freaking TOUCHDOWN ON A 3RD AND 21!!!!  I am GUARANTEEING YOU THIS RIGHT NOW...this team has NO CHANCE of winning ANYTHING, let alone a freaking SUPER BOWL, with Joe Woods as our defensive coordinator...PERIOD!  At this point we literally are going to miss the playoffs if OBJ and Joe Woods are kept on this team.  You can BOOK IT!  OBJ had d4mn well better be TRADED by the trade deadline in two weeks and Joe Woods BETTER BE FIRED BY THAT POINT AS WELL!!!  I am FED UP with us WASTING the unbelievably STACKED roster that we have right now...and it is being wasted by JOE WOODS!!!
People keep sleeping on Kyler Murray and the Cardinals.
Prior to watching highlights :Super Bowl Browns, more like Toilet Bowl. Sure hope my Brownies get their toilet filling substance together. After watching highlights: the Browns just got beat by a better team. Simple. Brownies better shore up their D Backs or is a quick exit from the playoffs if they make them.
3:25 Deandre Hopkins gettin' his Barry Sanders on 3rd and goal for the td!💪💯
Muy entretenido, pero el G.O.A.T es el G.O.A.T
The Cleveland clowns doing Cleveland clowns things 🤣
“The loneliness man in Cleveland!!!” 😏😂👉🏻 🥺😢😩
Odell get df outta Cleveland dude
Murray stay healthy and here comes Zach!
Mondays headlines: Cardinals 6-0 good for them ; followed by 10 minute segments on what's wrong with the browns
He’s not even looking at obj
Cardinals remain unbeaten with a great run win against the Browns.
“Loneliest Man in Cleveland “ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How many times does Baker gotta cry like a baby after he fumbles the ball before he realizes every one knows he's faking?
With the amount of Cardinals players and coaches out either due to injury or covid I really did not expect the Cards to win by such a large margin. What a phenomenal game!
Baker is what?? Average nothing more
I think kyler murray is so underrated... he's going next level this year
Mayfield needs to be benched
Refs did the Browns dirty this entire game. But with that being said, they played bad nonetheless.
Bro im a baker fan since his sooner days but sheesh i'm really starting to think he's just not that guy, seeing lamar burrow allen herbert kyler, specially as a #1 draft pick, hes just not that guy... Baker Mid-field
Yeah Baby!  As good as the Offense is I'm getting even more excited about our Defense.  Special Teams among the league's best as well!  Go Cardinals 1 and 0  !!
The game is so fun to watch, from a hockey guy!
Plain and simple: Arizona looks untouchable and Cleveland must be at full strength on both sides of the ball if they want to make it to post-season football. With Chubb out, Hunt slowed with injury and key pieces on the defense missing, Cleveland had no chance against this surging Cardinals team. I will say, this team has had some struggles so far. Namely Kyler Murray has struggled with decision-making especially in the Minnesota game. But as many struggles the Cards have had, they seem to have just as many bright spots. I really like where this team is headed and I hope they can keep it going. Next week, they have an easier game against a Texans team that got obliterated by the Colts today. They need to keep the pressure on because after the Texans game, they have two tough games. The first is at home against the Packers on Thursday the 28th and the second is away against the 49ers, (who they had some struggles with last week). The Browns meanwhile have an interesting game against a Broncos team that lost to the Raiders today. I don't want to say it's easy because I don't know how injured the Browns will be in that game, (perhaps they'll get Landry back in that game which will help dramatically).
Cardinals vs ravens Super Bowl ?
The cardinals are winning the Super Bowl they are way too good this season
I hope Larry Legend is considering coming back to be apart of something special here in Phoenix!! 19ave and Thomas all Day!!🌅🌄
can’t wait for zac ertz next game..
Arizona is about to make history you heard it here first
A blessed day to you brothers and sisters. (We are all called to be family in Christ!🙂) Family, JESUS CHRIST THE LORD DIED FOR OUR SINS, HE WAS BURIED, AND HE ROSE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY!🙂🔥💯 Jesus (the SON OF GOD) LOVES US ALL!💯🙂 Peace and love to you all in the name of the Lord Jesus!🙂
Murry for mvp. Chase for rookie.
I remember I used to hype up murray so much and nobody listened to me. Years later here we are
Respect to Watt for checking up on Baker after getting the sack.
* Cardinals win the Super Bowl * Everyone: “still not elite, refs bailed them out, they only won cause the other team lost” smh y’all are unbelievable
Can’t believe they’re getting ertz lol cards are a different level
I watched the Roughing the passer guy race after Kyler Murray almost got LITERALLY Murdered by browns DL 97. That single play proves exactly how horrible this browns team really is, it shows how totally inexcusable their play has been, and is a prime example why the browns should trade everyone and fire all the coaches. It will NEVER work in Cleveland and that town will rot in football hell forever. This is the way. I became a nascar fan today.
Damn that end of half throw
Make us the underdog, we don't care! 💪🏽 Let's goo Cards!
Murray was intentionally dropping so that the browns had some kinda chance
Mayfield is literally ass lol. I feel so bad for OBJ.
Bills Cardinals Super Bowl? Hail Murray revenge game?
Kyler Murray is having a breakout year in 2021!!! Kyler Murray for MVP!!! Let's go Cardinals!!! Rise up sea red!!! How bout them bird's in Arizona!!!
I feel bad larry fitzgerald coudnt be apart of this team☹️
The Sooner Bowl The Heisman Bowl The Number 1 Pick Bowl
ROOTING FROM ALASKA LET'S GO AZ CARDINALS
Turn down for watt!!!
I was a fan of Murray since college and im honestly amazed of how good he was and how insane he has been in the NFL even if he isnt on my team
Baker commit to the run protect the ball
Man I just wish Larry Fitz was still on this team.
Baker Trashfield aka Johnny Manziel 2.0 fails again no surprise, good job Cardinals 💯.
I'm getting hype on the toilet 😭
"Touching the passer, 15yd penalty"
Imagine the cardinals go 17-0
I have been a cardinals fan forever iam a die hard cardinals fan
If we had nick chubb and juice laundry we’d be good our secondary is just trash and so is our offensive tackles
From the time MYLES GARRETT has put up the QB Gravestone Decorations in his front yard The BROWNS have gone 0-2 Against 2 of those QBs
This game also reminded me of the Wild Card game between the Browns and Steelers where the Browns didn’t have their coaches and won decisively.
6:07 run your mouth when your team is actually winning 😂
7:49 😂😂
Hey NFL, Stop.Going.For.It. did I miss somthing this year or do coaches think it's Madden? 😂
The browns are banged up rn compared to the more healthy cards, they were outmatched. Offensively they all made mistakes, it's easy to blame the QB but not think harder on the offense overall. The cards were just the better team today
Me as a Dolphins fan: Pops champagne anyway and drinks entire bottle
For sure the clown analyst will have another excuses about cardinals winning again 😂😂
Cards win despite losing starting tight end for the season last week, starting center out, all-pro Chandler Jones out, head coach out, and on the road.  Not joking around.
Just imagine next week when we play Houston.
the folks who make the rankings on a weekly bases had the cardinals at #1 just once, all the other times, you had several teams with losses in front of the cardinals, you rankers should put some respect on them!
Never would I think the cards go 6-0. One game at a time tho! Good luck to the browns on the season! Sucks with these injuries they have to go back Thursday! BUT 6-0 BABY! ONTO HOUSTON
Brahh Odell be wide open 😂😂
Officiating remains laughable  Browns are ravaged with injuries   Browns defense is horrific   Watt flexing over second string O linemen got annoying fast
Every week I heard excuses after the Cardinals won. What will it be this week? Nick Chubb was out?
number 11 is a wanna be deandre hopkins on the second lucky tuchdown
Cardinals vs Bills SB
Browns fans  stop with crying about the refs. Just. Learn. How to play clean and u won’t get the flags.  🤣🤣🤣✌🏽
Cards lookin tough this year 💪🏾
Hopkins> Beckham
Best part is chandler Jones didn’t play haha
Watch still not be ranked #1 in power rankings... hell if we would've lost we would've went #2 to #10 easily. But hey keep sleepin' on us. GO CARDS!
Mayfield is so trash
Maybe less commercials and more practicing Mayfield
J.J. Watt had a great game. Houston really misses him.
My favorite team
Browns defense with all that pre season hype looking like hot trash...D Coordinator better get his bags packed.
Baker ain't getting an extension
Cardinals are for real. Browns are not.
lol BROWNS WILL ALWAYS SUCK.
Baker is a game manager who needs a dominant running game in order to be successful. Kyler has just gotten better and better every year.
J.J. Watt 💡🔌💡⚡⚡⚡💡🔌💡
Cardinals pls stop the bucs sincerely, everyone
Kyler Murray had a nice performance for the Arizona offense and the Cards defense put down Baker Mayfield. If Cleveland can't knock down the Cards, then who will?
As a browns fan we got to get a new quarterback……
6-0
Yo man... Baker Mayfield sucks.
If you don’t think the Cardinals are legit at this point in time, then I honestly don’t know what to tell you: You’re just either really dumb or a hater.
Warms my cold heart to see the browns lose. Oh and MVP going to that guy in Baltimore
Browns live and die on Chubb.
GG Cardinals. I definitely see y’all in the Super Bowl this year. As for my fellow Browns fans, keep our heads up! We still got a fairly easy schedule! We will be fine .
I have never seen quicker highlights lol Cardinal are on another level
Man the browns need Jarvis Landry bad I'm happy to see aj green still putting in work he belongs with the cardinals
“Cards looking unstoppable” against An injured quarterback A team without their star runningback  A team with an injured runningback (Hunt) A team with injured receivers  A team with huge o-line injuries A team with injury holes in the defense  Wow yeah “GREAT” win Cards! You really showed this depleted browns team who the boss was!    🙄
Kyler Murray is currently leading the MVP race
Kyler is the best leader and QB in the league right now. Sensei K1 🥋 Baker needs more help from his receivers. The Browns are good but not great. Arizona is the next potential DYNASTY.
Making Grandpa Cardinal proud!  7:49 Kyler looking at the Hail Mary. "...and I took that personally."
Yall see ObJ's other drop on 4th down? Not why we lost but hes gonna drop some catchable passes for ya
Man that was pathetic not even a fight if we lose to Denver I honestly dont see baker signing with us he had 3 turnovers like cmon
trade obj
I like the way JJ checked on Baker after he sacked him. Good guy you got there Cardinals.
OBJ actually did alright here, but golly Baker looked kinda off again today
So nobody told Murray you don't have to play well when your team is this good?
Red Sea Baby
The Cardinals look like the best team in the league imo..Kyler Murray destroyed Mayfield  again. Was really hoping Baker would have had a good game today and help get the W but Baker is still my qb and the was a team L. We lose to Denver then I'll panic because I'm getting the 2019 Browns vibe. As for ObJ he    is hit or miss
They winning a chip this watch .
I don’t mind Vegas continuing to disrespect AZ. I’ll keep taking the $$ 🤑🤑
I've been a defender of Baker or at least the guy that wanted to see more data before saying he is good or bad. Seeing Kyler Murray with his speed and better arm I can't say Baker can get them to the Super Bowl. You need an elite QB if you want to have a real chance at a championship. You need a guy who can win from behind with the arm and speed to get the team out of a hole. Baker is a great competitor with a winning attitude but barely 6 feet with 4.84 speed and an good to average arm ain't going to make it. If Cleveland had Justin Herbert they would be Super Bowl favorites.
The media and others gonna pretend that 75% of them didn't pick the browns to beat the Cardinals
Isn't it funny how a few years ago, the Browns would have given ANYTHING for a 3-3 record, and now a 3-3 record is cause for panic?  This short week will be a big test of this team's strength and resilience, but I think the Browns will be OK if they can take care of business against the Broncos on TNF 😳
Well we played balanced football today we sucked on both sides off the ball.
paid refs against the browns again
baker needs to stop doing  commercials. picked over murray and LAMAR JACKSON  is a complete embarrassment for the franchise
Some NFL analysts have been hesitant to anoint the Cardinals true Super Bowl contenders. Can't do that any more.
Even the 2015 Cardinals weren’t THIS good
Can't believe people are on here trash talking the Browns.  They'll see.  What a pathetic excuse for human beings.  Baker is potentially the toughest qb in the league.
The best Baker Mayfield TV ads are the ones that air immediately after some boneheaded turnover.
Four TDs! Let’s go Murray. I’m enjoying every bit of the Cardinals success after several years of disappointment and underperforming
Browns put up a fight but they're not contenders like the bucs or cardinals or rams or bills are n they found that out the hard way. Regardless of injuries cause the cardinals also were missing key players(respect from denver)
First my Phoenix Suns now my AZ Cards have officially arrived #VALLEYBOYZ
As a Rams fan, Cardinals being 6-0 is unnatural.
I said it last week and I’m gonna say it this week. Fix the referees. The browns got screwed out of a win last week and all game today the refs were throwing horseshit calls. You guys are embarrassing and I’m starting to loose interest. I truly hope other people are too so everyone stops watching and you guys go bankrupt because I’m tired of it
I wonder how many haters who are still dismissing AZ claiming the Browns suck were guaranteeing a Browns win today….
Cards fan here, hope Mayfield is ok
Baker better book some more commericals...
At this point, we should sign Trace McSorley. He the true goat 😤
1:48 Odell was wide open for the 1st down right there bruh and the very next play too💀 but damn kyler Murray is looking like an mvp rn
that baker TD with 3sec was just class.
OBJ gotta go
Now the cardinals get to face the Texans, so they are effectively 7-0
Running with that ball 🏈 out like that... made me sick to my stomach I literally almost broke the tv.. I've seen thieves run with purses better then how baker ran with that ball only to have it knocked away.. my goodness just terrible.. I mean stunk up the place 🏟 standing there in the pocket waiting to be sack was just so 🐕 on stupid...
True die hard Cardinal fans are calling out tomorrow 🤣💯
GG cardinals fans.  You guys are nuts
Go browns chubb is the king
Kyler the best qb in fhe nfl
Cardinals vs bucs for super bowl
The browns are extremely overrated football team.
Looks like the same old browns.  A loser franchise for sad fans that love being disappointed year after year.
Cardinals are scarey good
6-0 for the Cardinals. The Browns have unfortunately been hit with the injury bug.
IMAGINE DRAFTING BAKER OVER LAMAR AND ALLEN LOL  BROWNS WILL NEVER WIN A RING
What can I say? Browns is the Browns
Fun Fact: this is the 3rd time in Cardinals franchise history that they started 6-0. 1st: 1922 (Chicago Cardinals) 2nd: 1974 (St. Louis Cardinals)
Colin Cowherd boutta have a field day with this one
At least 2 open men per play and Baker can't see them. Lacks vision and has become to antsy this year, running way too much. Other QBs have worse lines and do more with less. Running out of excuses for him.
put jj on the outside and we wont lose. kingsbury gonna need zoom subscription.
Kyler Murray is leaps and bounds better than Baker Mayfield
Cards are on a mission, and they are playing out of their minds...don't sleep on this team, especially Murray, elusive man... Edit...thx for the likes yall, appreciate it!!
The *Cleveland Browns* should cover the playing field in cardboard.  Because they always play better on paper.
Awful and disgusting game.  Horrible calls by the refs like those two roughing the passer calls and numerous awful pass interference calls.  The plays they did get off they choked on.  O line was fractured Baker constantly getting hurt, the entire team is injured etc.  Good luck Cardinals, BUT THE REF BALL HAS TO STOP!!
NFL fans when Baker has bad performance or team loses: HeS tRaSh    Yeah let’s just not blame the fact that we have bad coaching right now 😐
Yessir 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😈
Browns getting even more injuries and bad calls from the refs, whats new ey?
New player Zach Ertz
Man, this Cardinals team is a force!
They're fun, they're winning via both sides of the field. And they seriously deserve some prime time.
The browns need to die as an organization
The Cards have scored over 30 points in 5 of the 6 games that they have played in so far
Bruh all you browns haters sound mad ignorant in these comments
No head coach, who also happens to be the offensive coordinator, missing our Center, tight end, and most of our defensive front. This was a STATEMENT.
Can anyone stopped them ?
The Cardinals are putting football 🏈 teams on notice they are a serious Contender
LETS GOOO! 6-0 #GoCardinals
I bet the Browns are really missing Chubb and Landry rn
As a browns fan I kinda knew Arizona would win 😐    Also Joe Woods needs fired
Browns is the Browns.
This might go unnoticed but I’m an up & Coming Artist worth the listen🗣🔥
Let gooo cardinals 6-0 baby browns fan need to trade baker in the off-season he ain't the answer
Jones was not even playing!
Feels so damn good to go 6-0, cards are unstoppable 🔥 Murray For MVP
Did you guys include all your bullshit calls here too?
Welcome back, Browns. Back where you should be.
Browns vs Refs and baker mayfield
Cardinals are the best team in the NFL

0-16 CLEVELAND BROWNS LOSE TO ARIZONA CARDINALS
https://youtube.com/shorts/QYX1XAAS0SQ?feature=share

The Cardinals are showing the world that they are thirsting to win that Super Bowl with their play on both sides of the ball
Fact: the Cards are super contenders!!
Cards adding Ertz next week, big time oof for the rest of the NFL! Let's go Cards!
BROWNS PLAYED LIKE BISHOP SYCAMORE
All you haters will be real quiet after this
Trade Odell please, tired of seeing these drawn up plays for Odell and he drops passes and then the drive dies.
Murray for MVP!!
Boy the Browns made a HUGE MISTAKE drafting that bum Baker over Lamar and Allen. He can't come from behind. He is a belie average QB at best
A wise man once said:  “Browns is the Browns”
2ez
First?
Man this Cardinals team look unstoppable
Fun fact: the browns can’t beat good teams
Cardinals: AS Roma!  Browns: Tottenham Hotspur!
