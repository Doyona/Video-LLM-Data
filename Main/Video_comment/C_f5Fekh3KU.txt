The way  they did Mitchell was just wrong
Rename the town; ""Helly'oaks.""
Plz call the CEO
We need a new trailer for March and April storylines.
Man I haven't watched Hollyoaks since they killed off Harry. I missed a lot I see
I DUNNO
Come on I just watched the 2015 trailer and it was so exciting, mysterious but now it's pretty boring dont get me wrong though I love hollyoaks
i really hope that they find out about the charlie and ella situation. Is it just me?😂
Can we get a new trailer please
Is anyone here after this all happend just me
First of all, why does Brody look like he's about to kill someone at the end? Like, I get that he's angry at Sienna for cheating on him but he looks like he's about to say "right, I'm gonna kill him", meaning Warren. Good f*****g luck with that one Brody, Warren would plaster him all over the village. I mean look at what he did to Cormac and let's not forget how he didn't back down from an angry Sylver. I don't even get why Brody dislikes Warren so much. Like, yeah he's suspicious of him and Sienna, but Warren actually saved Brody from Cormac hitting him with a spanner or a wrench or something.  Secondly, why have they brought Victor back? And why are they still making him look like some big, tough drug lord? He's nothing, not a patch on the real tough guys of the village like Warren, Felix and even Ste to an extent. They're making Victor out to be so hard when all he is is a pathetic bully who intimidates no one (except kids and old ladies). If someone like him came up to me in the street and started ordering me to pedal drugs for them, I'd tell them to stick their drugs where the sun don't shine. If they tried beating me up for it, I'd drill their head through the ground. Please Hollyoaks, have someone give Victor the pasting he deserves. Don't just have him leave or get arrested never to be seen again, give him his comeuppance, have someone belt the living daylights out of him.  Thirdly, why have they put Ste and James together? They are 2 completely different people who used to despise each other. It's as if Hollyoaks thinks "hmm, 2 gay characters, they must be put together". I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we see a relationship, or even just a fling, between George and James in the future. That is, of course, unless George leaves after the whole domestic abuse stuff with JP. If you're that desperate for gay couples on the show, add more gay or bi characters. Even bring back some of the older gay characters like Brendan or Craig. But don't make ridiculous mismatches like Ste and James.
I‘ve been an Oakster for YEARS now and this is just top of the food chain PERIODTTTT
It’s Steph haycock from Waterloo road
Terrible acting. One of the worse I have ever seen. It could be good if they had good actors on it. I don’t know why this is still on TV. 👎🏻
Great programme
Aghhrrrrr ste and james please Definitely NO
No not sid doing drugs again for victor
cant waiittt
No one is talking about George punching John Paul. George is going to ruin him. I mean how can George do that to  John Paul. He  is so nice and kind and cares about the relationship
💖
okay i'm confused... the ste/james scene was shown last night but they didn't say what was shown in the trailer ?? (james' eyebrow raise was exactly the same so i'm confusion)
Sienna belongs with Warren and I can’t stand Brody the little worm sienna needs a real man not that pathetic mess
I'm am so sick of Brody taking the moral high ground with Sienna.  Yes, she's done some bad stuff, but so has he- and no one bats an eye with him.  It's safe to say, I am not his biggest fan.
Me: *Sees Brody proposing to Sienna*  Also Me: FINALLY! FLIPPING HECK! THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER FLIPPING ASK!
I can’t wAit
"03:58" 😂 I actually have been using *WATCHDAD.COM* 📌 no issue with it all
'3:58' 😂 Better head directly to *Watchdad.𝒄𝒐m'* . 🌏 should you know you really need it! 💚
Like... I always KNEW James would eventually hook up with Ste (this is Hollyoaks, after all) but I still am never going to accept it when it actually happens lol. It's the lowest of lows. It's an insult to Harry's memory, to James' character, hell, even to Ste. And to me personally.
I mean I'm not sure if they are going to do it, but man...James and Ste is such a goddamn stretch that I will never enjoy watching it, no matter what the chemistry between the actors.
O M G- AHHHH IM SO FRIGGIN EXCITED
Oh wonder who else they’ll suddenly turn gay.
I am glad that Edward is dead xx
My heart is breaking for John Paul
I already don't like Maxine's mom
Mercedes is happy so she must have got Bobby back.
Not Ste & James
Hollyoaks is the best soap yes Tony and Diane back together no Cleo Toby is bad news
I’m sorry but James would never be interested in Ste lmaooo.
Looks fucking shit it does this is why eastenders are doing a lot better and have better actors
Looks shit to be honest was hoping they would bring back jordan
John Paul deserves a good romance like in the good old days with Craig or Ste or James. Kiss is a miss!
Where is Linden, I don’t see her rainbow pfp and emote comments and I need those.
Am I the only one hyped for Ste and James? Just me? Well, okay, *skeet’s away.*
Ooh looking forward to all this drama! 🙌👏💖
My favorite character is Jordan. Is he out of prison?
Noooo sid
Oh Man lots of heavy mojo vibes, are coming in store for this series here, and wait it's now for a whole week Monday, through Friday oh wow.
DAMN THIS TRAILER IS ON FIRE. Sienna got a new rival. Tony and Diane is back on track Maxine's mum moves in with her new boyfriend who's Maxine new landlord and maybe something more. Victor might use Ella if he finds out she killed Jordan. Can Sid ever get a break he's trying to do right. James and Ste we have to see how that goes. John Paul needs to leave George because he about to be in a controlled abusive relationship hopefully he and Nancy can heal soon.
I’m still waiting for Harry’s long lost identical gay twin brother to show up. Maybe he will if Ste and James get together to complicate who he would choose?
OK, the Mitchell Scott steal away from Cleo I know about, but did Scott also fool around with Joel at some point?
I hope Sienna loses out on all the men and is left alone with having only partial custody of all her kids.
Yes Victor is back! I’ve been saying this for months, but I think Sid is being recruited to smuggle drugs in his prosthetic leg. There has got to be some justification for that story line.
Victor is the least scariest person I have ever seen and people being so scared of him is laughable
Ugh, Diane is back, can’t she just die already, or at least have amnesia and a new personality to replace the lackluster one she has on the show. Maybe she thinks she’s the Queen of England?
What's with maxine and older guys?, does she have daddy issues?. Whatever it is, I hope that she won't continue to see him afterwards. It's creepy with him being her mother's boyfriend. Sienna sure is possessive over brody. Viewers assumed that she would dump him and choose warren but instead it's with sienna fighting for him and getting caught out.
2:30 Kyle who played Laurie as warrens body double because him and  Anna are together 😍
Ste's had a go with every gay man in the village.
Poor John Paul! Looking forward to seeing this storyline. Great trailer👏👏👏👍
James and Ste?!😜really?.
3:03 lol was really a socially distanced fight, you can see the gap from a mile away
Come on Mercedes win
Team mercy
Why the fuck are they still dealing drugs?!
Wow I didn’t expect victor to be back
2:32 it's not Warren it's kyle pryor. The guy who used to play laurie
I used to enjoy watching the old episodes on friday!
eeeeek sienna and warren better get together again lmfao f*ck brody, summer can have him
James & Ste? No, no, no....! Never ever would James lower himself to be with a piece of trash like Saint Hay. Don't destroy James' character (the best in Hollyoaks!) like this. No!
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VERITY HAVING A BABY WITH SAMI  (it’s definitely going to be kurt’s child)
I can’t stand Toby)!!
I thought the County Lines storyline was over now!! And George hits John Paul wtf???? Glad Tony nd Diana are back together though xxx
Juliet and Peri are all I'm interested in, and the only two who didn't feature...(that tiny clip of her talking to sid didn't count) :(
Honestly it’s disappointing how HOLLYOAKS CAN MAKE TRAILERS AND REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THE THEME SONG BUT NOT ADD THEM I mean where’s Theresa Seth Silas victor summer etc like we want everyone that’s on the show on the theme song🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Oh no not Denise Welch from Loose Women 🤮🤮
Starting a petition to free juliet
Did is depressed Victor and George are INSANE.
It figures Ste would fall for the guy who stole his husband XD! I figured they were leading up to a domestic abuse story w/JP and George :(.
i wanna see more of brody..cooking ;)
So much 2 say.  1 looks like coming back evety night let's all get excited.  Akins is sometimes more than sex so Brody asking Sienna of an affair us laughable. Glad Tony and Diane moving forward.  Verity pregnant w Samia baby...love it and them 2gether.  Hell no George punched John .  Dump his abusive sorry punk a..and go for Ste
Who is the old man Mercedes was with
I'm worried about Ste and James seemingly getting together given their history
Watched a Few of Brendan Brady episodes on Dailymotion... How Hollyoaks was so much better then... Still good now but not as
this is cool but why doesn't victor back off now that Jordon is dead and why doesn't Ella go to the police also why is George turning so aggressive against John Paul anyway i'm exited to watch it tonight...
so charlie and juliet staying in jail
I think Victor will kill Sid now he's an amputee
My opinions on this trailer: Sienna and Warren, yay. Sid needs to stop getting involved with this shit. Feel bad for JP but Hollyoaks should've just left him with Craig. Absolutely and utterly disgusted by Ste & James being together. Literally, there could not be a worse couple. Absolutely livid that Hollyoaks would even go down that path,  but I guess since they're the only gays left in the village besides JP (In a relationship) and Scott (sorta still married) then they just have to be together, right? No.
Why can’t they leave Sid alone
just want victor to be be killed or caught secretly he is the biggest venom now. what sid is tryin to do be the next jordan
So Sid gonna go through the mill yet again, for heavens sake give the lad a break. End his turmoil and give him a happy storyline, oh I forgot Hollyoakes don’t do Happy!
That’s shit n I thought it was gon be interesting loll🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Cormac's daughter and brody suit soo much I never really shipped Sienna and Brody
This looks awesome 🥰 but victor is still around ugh he needs to be stopped :/
I reckon Toby will kill Cleo like he did to Lisa
I always thought sienna would propose to Brody rather than other way round   Still obvs the engagement will fall through with Warren and summer still about   I think I preferred Siena with Ben now  Maxine's mum just sounds annoying and Im pretty sure  knew trishes new fella is an old rival of warrens from prison   And this thing with Silas will probably end with Silas turning Bobby against mercedes and taking him and then killing mercedes
I can’t believe anything of this
I really couldn't touch Dianne, after knowing my dad has been there!!
Yesss Tony and dianne is back
yet another McQueen/Sienna year it seems.....you do remember you have other villagers too right?
Noooo don’t bring sid into it again
Me and my family are buzzing were so excited!!
ella still getting involved with victor and worry for sid's safety. hope leah comes on screen soon support her best friend
verity and sami yay
Please don’t let Mercedes get killed she’s the best actor
sienna warren brody summer drama. I'll watch to find out what happens first. who kisses first and see who I think is in the wrong sienna or brody
my john paul 😩😩🥺🥺💔💔
James and Ste, I can't wait 👀😍
So basically Maxine’s new story is having to sleep with her landlord to get by
Finally I saw James happy  ❤
Leave Sid alone hasn’t he gone through enough
New year...new bang. The fun never stops in hollyoaks. Why is that drug dealer back on the scene? I hate seeing his face now. I hope his pay back comes back to bite him.
who saw James and Ste coming
seeing juliet so lonely and broken, surely oaks can find away through the whole not visiting bc of covid? bc seeing someone you love/care about over a computer screen just isn’t enough, corrie have found a way through it with screens being put up in the prison etc:
George slaps John Paul.   Whaaaaat?
Can I ask who is this silas guy that's blackmailing the McQueen family?
Even it looks a bit the same 🙄 it’s still something to look forward too!! lol
I’m worried about John Paul after seeing George hitting him, (Kinda reminds me of when BB domestically abused Ste) I really hope that Brody’ll forgive Sienna after seeing that picture of her and Warren kissing, (Which is now why I’m confused because of with the virus still going on 🤨) I hope Mercedes doesn’t die and Bobby’ll be back with his Familia “Family” and hopefully Seth’ll betray his own Grandfather by telling the police 👮🏼‍♀️ what he’s planning on doing to the McQueen Familia “Family” they’ll all forgive Theresa for everything she’s done, I support #Serity but I still miss #Siami, please don’t kill off Sidney I want him to be happy and stay safe, 😟😟😟😟🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻 I’m really happy to see #Tiane are back together again, I hope the same for #Dancy and #Landy, since Charlie and Juliet are both locked up in birdcages. How long are we talking about for them? 🤔🤔🤔🤔 And that Male there talking to Maxine. Is that her Biological Father or her Step-Father? 🤨🤨🤨🤨 I was still hoping that #Steorge would become a couple but I have to admit #Stames is good tambien. ☺️☺️☺️☺️ I can’t wait to see all of this! #HappyBelatedNewYear to you all! ☺️☺️☺️☺️🤗🤗🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️ If any of these storylines ever happened to your Family, your Friends or you please let me know I’d be happy to talk to you about it. Blessings, Love and Support to you from America 🇺🇸!!!! 😘😘😘😘
WHY DON’T SID AND ELLA JUST KILL VICTOR OR AT LEAST GOERGE
Who is that kissing Sienna at 2:32?. Are we supposed to believe that's warren. Damn you Covid hahaha!
These storylines are YAWN. The drugs thing is so old now.  Silas yawn. More Sienna .. affair? Again? Yawn ... such a waste of such a beautiful character. Evil Sienna is soooo great and they waste her on cheating? Toby yelling she don’t love me STILL.. yawwwwnnnn
Chloe and Toby? 🤮
*why put James and Ste together they have no chemistry. I dont understand why this show doesnt let gay men be friends without them swapping partners constantly. and george needs to go to a therapist ASAP*
Can't wait for all of this to happen
I don't  way Brody  is mad at Sineana  cause  he's  looking  like  he's  in love with  that girl
Please don't let anything else happen to sid! Poor kids been through enough
Ste and James that’s interesting and cleo and Tony that’s weird and can we get rid the county lines please
Toby is boring
Wow wow!!!Hollyoaks is the best soap ever ..❤❤ it's going to wake everyone up during this lock down that's for sure..😉👍👍...
Back to Monday to Friday not gonna lie... I'm actually gassed
I really hope Silas doesn’t die, he’s too good a character to be killed off
Nooooo Ste and James???? You have got to be kidding me...
Oh no, more misery for John Paul.
I'm Alone 😍😥
Finally hollyoaks back on Thursday and Fridays 😭😭😭like these 3 days episode been killing me like they got away with it cause these old episode thru theyr were very good one they played like becca and Justin etc Neil and the mcqueens
Victor really doesn't care if they die.
I'm really curious about JP and George abuse story and how different it is going to be from stendan.
Not gonna lie.....other than the Siles thing....a bit boring and I’ve been watching Hollyoaks for years....
Worst trailer ever rubbish show
Lmao ik its restrictions but anyone notice when Warren goes to kiss sienna's that his head got skinnier lmao and hair longer from the back hahaha so obvs lol
So the county lines storyline is yet another storyline which is getting dragged out 🙄   Leave sid alone 🙄
Was hoping for something about Charlie/Ella being exposed for being Jordan’s killer ☹️ Really hoping that Darren dumps Mandy when he finds out, always hated them as a couple because of the affair
I'm excited for psycho Gramps Vs the queen, warennas affair exposed, Verity and Sami child but could it be someone else's?, Domestic abuse/coercive control storyline by with JP and computer kiss, Toby exposed? Victor scary lads back
Woow woow 😍💋 💝💖❤️
James and Steven? Oh, nooooooooooo! Non!
2:44 Beautiful 💋💋love u💋💋
