What I don't understand is why there are only 768 comments....that's like less that 0.1% of the 821k views???
Looove the video :-) I've just posted a new one too if you'd like to check it out :-)
Go Molly you boss bish
well done Molly ☺️so happy for you
She’s so so pretty I am not into love island like the other people out there but this girl is always on my tiktok fyp and she seems so nice and caring ♥️
I can't believe you're a role model. Me me me! Other people are genuinely ill and then there's you seeking attention. You don't work an honest day's work and you parade your cash when people are struggling to put food on the table. You should be ashamed.
Hi!  House looks fab. Oh may Gawd. Simply fabulous petal.  Tots right about that bathroom. Bin it. Bull dozse it beach. So Scareface. So cocaine.  Also your nails are fab too. ProTip - guys you're tipping on the side hate long nails from a lady hygiene situation petal. They'd be like: "How does she wipe her arse and then make my dinner?"  Love you more than yourself percious.  Kisses!
Organ harvesting is one of the worst human rights violations imaginable, and it is hard to fathom that a state could systematically take so many innocent lives for their organs, said Peter van Dalen, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), on November 29.  Mr. van Dalen made this remark at a hearing held by the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights (DROI). During this event, legal experts, witnesses, MEPs, and other officials called for the European Union (EU) as well as the United Nations to take action to stop organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).   MEP Peter van Dalen at a hearing held by the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights (DROI) on November 29, 2021  Falun Gong Practitioners Are Main Victims of Organ Harvesting The China Tribunal, an Independent tribunal investigating allegations of forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience in China, released a judgment on this issue in June 2019. “Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and Falun Gong practitioners have been one – and probably the main – source of organ supply,” wrote the judgment.   Sir Geoffrey Nice QC spoke at the hearing.  Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the China Tribunal, spoke at the hearing. He said that the Tribunal examined the evidence in detail, and its members then reached a unanimous conclusion that forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced in China for a long time.  The judgment was initially delivered orally, followed by a summary judgment in June 2019 and a full judgment in March 2020. The judgment shows that the CCP killed people and sold their organs for profit. Sir Geoffrey pointed out that the report has many pages of reference and that the conclusions have remained unchallenged.
💖👑👑💖🎬🎥📽👏👏👏👏👏👏xxxx
Celebrating with you xx
Why are all the neutral comments being deleted?
Enjoy your blogs so much ! Congrats btw x
Also, i think you should call your vlogs House Moving Part 1 x
I am SOO happy for you both. I have watched you both since Love Island and have routed for you since DAY 1! Seeing how far you've both come is SUCH an inspiration it's unbelievable. I and my partner have been looking for a place to rent as my landlord has been so illegal throughout our tenancy. I can not stress how stressful it is looking for a place to rent with animals in such a short amount of time. If we do not find a place we are at risk of homeless but this video gives me hope! From being turned down places really is a kick in the but. Congratulations to you both! I hope to live a life similar to yours one day. Thank you for the inspiration you give on every single video. Absolute idolise you and your work ethic <3
does anyone where with the infamous Tommy necklace is from?? dying to get my hands on one but I can't seem to find it anywhere :(
it's absolutely beautiful, congrats! ❤
Congratulations
Literally, what a conundrum. Shall I literally have a home account, (whatever that is), and literally risk being literally burgled, or literally not have a home account and literally have nothing to literally brag about, literally.
Closing the blinds to be careful yet there’s a massive article on daily mail listing what the property! Eek awkward.
There is she, the perfect example of a non-privileged hardworking woman
Here home less me. :)
OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU MOLLY!! 🥳🥳🥳 this is such a big moment in your life I can’t wait to see what you do with your new place 💜
Piss off out of ppls recommended yeah
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
She looks so different with no makeup on
So happy for you 😄❤️
Do you realise how selfish and utterly rude it is to cancel appointments 4 times? Do you not see the news? The countries health care is in a shambles and people are dying whilst waiting for appointments. This girl is so painfully out of touch with reality and the people who worship her are beyond thick.
The Northern Ireland accent 😎

Amazing content full of infos💜
Omg ahh
How exciting!! Congratulations homeowners :-) xx

You worked really hard for this! You got your daddy to get you on love island and now you “work” with loads of companies, making those 24 hours count hun!

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
You could call it new house new chapter
Wait you have a cat?
I've never been into home vlogs but I'm sooo excitedddd for this series of videos omg

I tried to wean myself from you but it’s just impossible you are soo addictive especially now with your new home I’m beyond happy for you both 🥰🥰🥰
congrats Molly! all the best with the house move and account 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love green colours in a home, so relaxing and calm... Definitely love the gold lights... Its a beautiful ensuite, hope you re house the ensuite as its ashame to put into a skip, maybe on the free for you sites, so it will go to someone who cant afford much but would really appreciate it, maybe a good idea.. Im going to love the home vblogs, exited... You and Tommy deserve a home 🏡 of your own, as you both work so hard and such a lovely couple... Hugs from Donna xx here on the Wirral 💕

“oh. my. dear. god. ya nearly got decapetated!”
Everyone has 24 hours so just go get that half mil house from pissing about on TV and profiteering from slave labour.
John 3:16-18   Jesus loves you   Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God.

Does anyone know the brand of the jumper she has on at the beginning of the video? The turquoise coloured jumper
So happy for you Molly!! Thank you for sharing your journey with us ❤xxx
Hi, I think looking at the dressing room and en-suite and your situation and past circumstances - I would maybe knock out the en-suite and turn it into a safe room/ walk in vault which is fully secure for all goods and for you and Tommy to enter should you need to be secured
Yay! Congrats! 🤍🤍this is amazing
I’ve always wondered, famous people like Molly- when they buy a house the person they’ve bought it from will know who they are. (So could potentially share it, the address etc) so is there extra paperwork for famous people that you have to sign for privacy agreements etc?? Does anyone know? Always curious about this!
So happy for u.. excited for the vlogs 😍❤️
Congratulations 😍😍
You can see how excited she is!!! I don’t think I’ve ever seen molly this happy ever! She’s glowing and I’m here for it! Sooo happy for you molly. I couldn’t stop smiling for you throughout it!🤍🤍

Gorgeous bedroom and bathroom, don’t change the room it’s so hard to get it zen like that.  The marble in the bathroom is expensive and exquisite.  I would keep it.  Both rooms are to die for!  Think hard before you change that bedroom and bath.  SO JOYFUL FOR YOU, DESERVE IT!💜✝️🌸❤️🇺🇸🌹
Congratulations Molly! Such an inspiration! Hard work truly pays off! :)
I love it ❤️
Joiners in American English is contractor and gherkins are pickles in American English.  Your jewelry is now in the bank so it is safe and you can have a home account.  Can’t let criminals control your life, live your life as it is short.  Did I miss the cat vlog?  Oh no I didn’t.   Good it’s coming. 💜✝️🌸❤️🇺🇸🌹
Planning your move, part one.  Moving part one and then renovating the house part one, etc.  that could be your titles:-). 💜✝️🌸❤️🇺🇸🌹
I am so happy for you Molly, God continues to bless you.  His timing is always right on time.  My house took forever to find in Newport Beach, prayed for it and it took one year and hundreds of house viewings.  You deserve everything you have worked so hard for.  I am so proud of you.  💜✝️🌸❤️🇺🇸🌹
LFG
So happy for you!! I have been watching this journey and you house hunting for the longest time! You really do deserve it 🤍

New house gorgeous cats now all we need is marriage and a baby so happy for u both xx
The robbery could’ve happened to anyone don’t let it stop you from showing us, example Mrs hinch shares every inch of her home the outside too and the same with Stacey Solomon shows us everything people do forget so many influencers show their homes more than molly Mae and tommy have with their homes so don’t be getting on saying she shares too much when some literally show us the exact location of the house and nothing is said to them x
We’re on holiday in New York, and saw Molly’s billboard in Times Square this morning, absolutely stunning !!!!!! Well done Molly.
Congratulations to you both! 🤗
I'm so proud of you molly! You are an  inspiration! Enjoy all your success! 💖💖😁

Good luck at the hospital too sweetheart 💕
So happy for you both! Nobody deserves the happiness more than you! 🥰❤️
Instead of saying “Moving Vlog” #1 you should just do “Molly Maison #1” “Molly Maison #2” that way you can continue the series after you’re finished moving!
You could just call it “house journey” because it’s a new exciting journey in your life?
Will watch the rest of the video and support the house find but it is bugging me about the 4 cancellations of blood tests. Whilst it's understandable that appointments can cause anxiety I hope these weren't repeated cancellations of NHS appointments.
Well in mate all the best x
Omggg congratulationssss!!!!!🥳🥳🥳 I think you should call it (Molly’s) Mansion’s make-over
As soon as I saw this video I immediately clicked!! 😂😂💗💗 congrats to y’all!!

Next time you’re getting coffee in Starbucks you should ask for their blonde roast coffee (if you haven’t already) it’s much less intense flavour wise than their normal Blend.
