This comment section is chaos
I would like to know if any comong out of Africa ???
Uh oh
Faye was my last one. I'd rather deal with blizzards in Wisconsin
Can we just appreciate how good they make content? 32:53
Maybe DeSantis could take one those planes he use to send the migrants!
Thank You For The Information About The Weather Forecast Storms
Romans 10:9 ~ That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 🙏🏽Repent & accept Jesus as your Lord & Savior!
When I want details, I come to the comments section to hear from all of the REAL meteorologists...
The track is always aimed at the largest population area, in this case tampa. Gotta scare the most people
Wait. Won’t Governor DeSantis be using his private jets to fly everyone to safety??
TV weather presenters are amazing. So much information presented so clearly and succinctly.
What does this have to do with corporations paying low wages and overworking Americans? Join a union, and your insurance coverage will be so good you won't care about hurricanes.
I'll worry when I see Cinderella's castle fly by.
Watching from Jamaica
There just gonna have the hurricane kill itself before it hits land again quit trying to control the damn weather humans
Doubt it will come to south Florida like Broward county cities.
This is an absolutely *MASSIVE* storm.
People are already acting stupid in Ocala buying all the gas making it impossible for the working man to get back and forth to work these fear mongering news stations are ridiculous scaring people for profit
Any time a Storm passes on the west end of Cuba it swings it around and it comes in about cedar key,No biggie
All you non MAGA Florida's, stay safe. The rest of you... don't
Nothing but propaganda as usual. God forbid they really tell us where it's going which they already know.
How we go from F to I?
CARUMBA !
God bless you and protect you too.🙏
Make sure to test your car alarms like a f****** idiot... Don't want nobody stealing your raccoon food
In Galveston… grew up in the Keys. Here we go again. Be safe u guys
It's a Cat 2 or 3 at landfall, let's tone down the "End of the World" reactions.. The last cat 3 we had barely budged my plastic 6ft fence.. Try a Michigan blizzard mixed with an ice storm.. Now THAT'S wicked... Now, I'm going to be pissed if this hurricane skips us and goes toward Navarre/Destin area. Don't be bogarting our damn fun! You guys had 2 hurricanes the past 2 years. WE WANT ONE!!
Hopefully communications stay up. Big week next week for traders(locals) start connecting a backup
"Watch" for Jamaica.  South FLA. still not out of the clear.
Stop so many commercials, money hungry.
Maybe this gent would be a better Auctioneer with all his tongue twirling.
It looks like it’s not even coming to FL??
Insurance premiums will be going through the roof
Good morning God bless you from Jamaica
Get gas and water folks 🤘😎
What happened to Hermine
Lol it's Curacao not Curagao. 🙂
Remember folks, blame Trump for any damage this storm may cause.........ok.
Karma! Maybe Floridians could use a migrant plane for higher grounds 😁
BEING A HURRICANE HUNTER IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. TURBULENCE TIMES  GAZZILLION...YIKES!!!
No hermine ok skip it
A good day for pleasure cruising.
I don't panic or get scared, they always pull away at last minute.
Hi sincerely no bad storms for no one hopefully may it just die down and may blessings and miracles be with all peace✌️🙏✌️🙏
It will go further west wake up the other hurricane going north east will push this hurricane out west missing Gulf of Mexico.
What these 🤡s do is scare people into going somewhere and then the hurricane goes to where they went trying to get away from the hurricane. They have no idea where it's going to hit. See,all of the sudden the cone is moved. Which means they have no clue.
Home depot, Walmart,Publix ,Amazon ready to make money 💲💲💲💲💲😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂 when your news👂is make for big companies 😅🙂😅🙂🙂
Boo hoo 😂😂😂
PRAYING FOR THE BEST FOR ALL  🙏💕🙏💕🇯🇲  WATCHING  FROM JAMAICA  👍 THANKS FOR  THE UPDATE  🙏
West coast! East coast just rain.
So….. Who’s the dummy who spelled Curaçao with a “G” ????
At least we don't have to hear everyone struggle to pronounce "Hermine" 😂
Not a cyclone it is a hurricane
Thanks 😊
Wouldn't it be nice if everyone prepared enough not to need FEMA.
Where ever it hits ,it is gonna hurt alot of people's lives, sad, nobody needs this right now
Jamaica 🇯🇲 will be getting alot of rain
How come the letter I comes before the letter H. Shouldn't we have Hermine before Ian? Can someone explain this fir me please?. Gaston is the last storm i heard of.🤔
See. Now its going west. Not falling for this again
Thank You.
can we travel are we should stay home
So happy reporting on a major hurricane that will potentially devastate people's homes and lives...sick!
