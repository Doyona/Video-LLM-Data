Fake window is amazing 😮
Rapper name for Katie: Lil' Qt I love you guys and I adore the way you two interact with each other. You are a beautiful couple!😊
They look so pretty!
They are cute
Thats stunning. That fake window shadow is so subtle. The tables where amazing too.
Even turn into Katelyn today!
Obviously, Katelyn's rapper name is Little Res.
It looks like an xray scan lol
Resin sandwich please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
the fake window caught me so off guard and i loved it
gotta love resin time, resin time, ow ow ow ow resin time :)
30:45  Jooby Boop?    *im not feeling so well atm, but im trying my best since i’ll feel better making this comment and watching more of yall’s videos*
I would’ve cheated and bought a marble tapestry and clear resin 😂
No joke I thought he said I wanna drop cheese😂
Particle wood dressers are nice dressers what?
20:45 white in white. Evan: "Neat, yeah, that was a great one. That was an awesome vein!" I love the positivity 😊
I love how Evans voice deepens. He's so chill, I love it!!
i love the nightstands, but i would also love to see like Opal Resin things, that shimmer and shift to rainbow colors bit in Matte :D
Katelyn’s hair the Twin pony tails near the end! Looks amazing she is so cute!!
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JOOB HAIR.
I want one
I hope evan is the bottom, he is so cute
Your resin pour at 16:35 got bubbles in it because you painted the background and it caused the oil separation due to leaching back into the resin. Katelyns didnt do that because she didnt paint hers.
Resin time
How did Kaitlyn get + 30 chaos in 30 minutes😂
"You now why"😉 " we're filming a video"
35:10 just me screaming to leave the blue tape on until you sand the edges of the resin
Why did no one notice Katelyn’s pigtails in the outro??? They so 🥰
Katelyn's rap name would be Lil Katz
I need to inform people about the furniture (aka resin monstrosities) they make over at Positive Couple. They are a Russian couple that make just the most outlandish resin furniture that only they could love.
Dj. Resin.
Furniture that you gotta be careful with... is anything in America built to last? I have some furniture that I got from my grandmother and she got it from her grandmother and it's still looking pristine
While I love the fun you two are having and resin is your schtick, you could just like get actual marble tops and slap them on top. They even make this artificial quartz marble that is sealed and doesn't stain. I have a side table with it and after years of drinks, hasn't leaked or anything.  For resin, it'd be cool to have a side table that like glowed softly to wake you up in the moring.
Swag-daddy MoleMan
23:27 100% pen15 😂
I went through such a wild roller coaster with the experimental pours. The first layer. I liked Evans at first and Katelyns was looking wild but then Evans settled in weird so I ended up liking Katelyn's but the second final glow pour was really "forgiving" and it turned out great for both but I still ended up liking Evans in the end.
Y'all did awesome!!!!
In my experience a heat gun to soften the lines and adding a chrome or pearlescent Mica pigment for veining is so worth it
It’s a pink sweater, but it’s gray 😅 3:41
as a french native, i think the bit with google translate was accurate enough 😂
Culture Hustle Glow Powder is the best I have ever used, lasts for HOURS.
Not Evan flipping us off at 12:07
16:09 someone plz translate the French, I’m too tired rn
4:15 love the bob ross reference
years late but her rapper name? "Resin ecstasy"
"MC Resinate" FTW!
i wonder if the light coming off of these tables ever make it hard for them to sleep
hahahhaa 30:25
The windows thing actually blew my mind.
Katelyn's rapper name would be, Lil Craft
Rapcat
Resin time resin time ow ow ow ow resin time!!!😄😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😏😏😏😏my glasses!!!!!!!!!
Resin time resin time owowwo
1:26 how? What is he doing do make that many scratches and dents? How? Edit: the beginning skit basically proves that they are not that type of channel but… you can second guess that fact every now and then :)
Oh my god, the French subtitles. . . 🤣
Ok so I can speak French and when you did the French bit it was very funny
I LOVE IT!  CAN I SEND YOU MY FURNITURE TO DO THIS?! My nightstands and dresser! Omggg!
Lil kitty kat
I want to make something like this for myself, now!
The fact that they did the same technique with different results is wild 😭
My family and I are moving soon and I want to diy most of my new room and I think I want to try this!
For the people who wondered what the Frenchs bit was, here i translated it:  this proves it, this first, my love, here my love, the first I made, it's all google translate sorry French people that it was making love on the roofs of Paris! they were both dips in a tube my love, sacred blue!
I’ve been loving y’all’s videos! I’m thinking about getting into resin pouring to make keycaps and your work is so inspiring!   I definitely thought thrift store end tables were going to happen before the real deal but you killed it
Hi guys! 😅
They look so unreal When you put ur hands over them
Double Stuggle Duo rapper names
i love the french!!!LOLL
❤🎉
anyone else notice Evan not even realizing he flipped off the camera after messing with the other camera settings or something
So much cat hair 🤮
You have a fake light... that makes it look like a window is off screen... WHAT.
the double chin is real with katelyn
Idk if this would be cheating but for an even easier way, I would do contact paper that’s marbled and then a coat or resin.
Personally I h8 the resin aesthetic. But, I h8 RTA furniture even more. So, this was a significant upgrade. Well done.
The thumbnail looks like a demented bee keeper.
So relatable 😂. Excellent idea for refinishing. Thanks you guys, I might have to try this out
Rapper name for Katelyn Lil 🤏Toebean’s 🐈‍⬛
These turned out AMAZING!
I like Evans final test pour.... But.... I like Katelyn's first pour though best for an end result. You guys are crazy.... I've now watched 3 of your videos..... Therefore... I'm subscribing😂   Btw WOW on both y'all's finals!
Ow ow ow ow resin time had me laughing so hard 😂😂
It was until I saw the very close up of evens side that I thought it wasn’t horribly damaged and katelyn was being a lil dramatic (in a nice way) I guess it was damaged 2:11 😂
resinna marbles
Rapper name? Lip'n Kit'n 🎄
16:42 Theory here: what if the paint that Evan put down messed with the resin? That’s the only difference between them that I saw. I’ve always been puzzled by then until I just rewatched it and realized he put paint down before the resin.😬😬
I would do white pink blue
Mom! The shadow man is makig me question if im real or not! 38:16
i wonder if the first layer of evan's turned out so weird because of the paint he put on the bottom
I don't know
Buy my Murphy at this cite right here 👆

@evanandkatelyn rapper name for katelyn has too be "Dirty paws" 🐾
Anyone else need tables that glow because they are a klutz? It’s me. I need

So beautiful!!!! I love the classy look! Wow!!❤❤
"We switched sides of the bad" Absolute maniacs. WHO DOES THAT.
K da Housekat as a DJ name
I like how Evan used to wear glasses but now Katelyn wears them❤
Try it with a higher viscosity resin
How you guys have used so much resin and don't know that alcohol ink has alcohol in it which makes the color run out in circles expanding away on the surface of the alcohol there's whole resin pouring techniques on just those little circles popping up for cool effects you guys blow my mind how do you not know this stuff
The second layer evan tried spread more because the surface was smoother
Now make a resin headboard
I was NOT prepared for the fake window.
Not that kinda channel...
Should have put wireless charging coils in the resin to charge your phones easier.  Otherwise they look great. Very nice.
The editing is always so subtle and funny. 10:25 "image not found" is killing me! The implication that either he's making stuff up or the editors were just too lazy to add it. Love it!!! (Anyone know who edits their videos?)
You guys should do a price mock up for the things you are making
I'm a year late, but rapper duo names could be Lil' Paw and Big Claw
I loved the joke at the start, you 2 seem very cute
🎶Sandpaper time! Sandpaper Time🎶Katelyn hates🎶Sandpaper time🎶
lil' kit and lil kat (rapper names)
Obviously the name is DJ Rez
Evan: I have a hard time with precision   Me: suree you do😂
I think the rap names are kit-kat, Katarazzi (taking her own pictures), Katrina hits hard too. But anyways just dropping a note.
"I think you're trying to make me feel better because you don't like it." Oof, Caitlin going right for the jugular. LOL I don't think she's wrong though. 😂
You should colab with nerdforg
that sandpaper noise was so awful :(
I did 2 resin marble night stands inspired by your guy's mine is a purple marble night stand and the other one is black and white marble side table now
LMAO I LOVE THE FRENCH SEGMENT, ITS SO ROMANTIC AHDUSJFGSFG
They look amazing. What would have done, White glow dirty poore and blue glow vanes. No kritik Just an idea, if you do kind of a thing like this in the future
That turned out so dang good GJ
I was mid drank when he ended his detective bit and cola came out my nose!
your rapper name is rapper cat tunes 🎵🎵🎶🎶🎹🎹🎼🎼
28:41-28:48 are funny
As a woman the advice I give is have glas cut to protect your furniture. Dressers end tables anything the man will put things on or touch!
31:26 hair or am i seeing wrong
you should make resin shoes
Katelyn should be MC Whiskerflow
Mais il y a avait des sous titre en français !  Oh trop cool ! j'ai enfin pu comprendre ! :D
Y’all need to make a big resin art piece for over the bed.
The reason the first layer came out different she used heat gun you didn't
THAT WINDOW LIGHT IS SO TRIPPY
They turned out stunning!!
are yous pregnant?
I just made  a marble  night stand  with resin... mine doesn't  glow in the dark but mine is purple marble
ABSOLUTELY GOBSMACKED! They look amazing. Well done to you both.
seems obvious Lil K or resin killa
I think you're cool Katelyn! 😂
Last thought, I don't know, I can't think of a situation where I haven't been happy to have my PearlX.  I've Never messed with resin before, these guys make me want to play. That is just so cool. 😊 I LIVE the glow!
Im just experimenting, YES, Bless your heart. 😊
Honestly, I have 1000 other materials that I work with, I'm not racing to resin, but it's just so much fun to watch you two. 😊
THE FRENCH SUBTITLES??? 😳
Is that how Yall eat tacos?
No bedhead? Then how do you... never mind.
Next do a bed frame

Katelyns rapper name is lil whiskas or small fuz
That wink pillow says it all
goddamnit the "ow ow ow ow resin time" got me good. One second earlier and I would have had tea over my keyboard xD
There’s an echo in your room. You need pictures on the walls.  Lol I know that’s my opinion. It’s your room.
What is nice about the glow in the dark portion is that because the visual pour is under a "transparent" layer, the phone looks to be floating, slightly.
Resin time                  Ow           Ow     Ow Ow Resin time

For the rapper name Captain Kats(my friend helped me think of this name)
ex spear minting
This was about to be the most interesting only fands ever
You should have watched Stone Cold Counter Tops first😂
I say if the little pressure pot is Pasquale, then the big one should be Rango!😉
Could the Ow Ow Ow Ow be in the rotation for the resin time.
E: "We need to make the top later more opaque-"  K: "you mean translucent?"  E: "this is why i love you. Youre so good with your words! 🥰"  Me: she... She still got it wrong 🤣
or you could look up any recipe, get the ingredients, prep and cook whatever and it would be just like hello fresh!
Love your videos. In binging them i noticed  you seem bothered that your diligent glove usage results in a belly full o gloves fer mr trashy. I can relate.    I found that i can suppliment with reusable dish type ones.  They're bulky so they aren't good for all jobs but they have definitely minimized the trash in that dept...😊  luv the chaos!
My rapper duo name is big ev and kk
Why is there no art on their walls???
You guys are awesome and your video editing skillz are awesome!
Evan mixing in the white tinting: ah yes pigment Me: mMmMmm qUesTiOnaBle LiQuId
Rapper duo name? Probably Order and Chaos
this seems really fun i wanna try resin work with my mum. Also i think it wouldve looked really cool if inbstead of the glow mixed in with the second layer you could do a really thin layer of glow powder over the whole thing but also idk how that would turn out??
would adding a slight blue or pale purple tint to the glow have neutralized the yellow of the glow at all?
Her Majesty in the beginning of the video: "Plz Hoomama, Hooman, stop talking loudly in my naproom and bounce on my big bed." xD Man she's so cute!
Why do you guys know so many long words like cathartic and some other stuff i cant think of right now
This was definitely one of your most impressive projects!  They turned out so wonderful!  And they gloooooooow!!!!  😮😮😮
Anti-Chaos Katelyn rapper empress
Tysm for the great testing and ideas! These came out amazing

My question is do you both still like these a year later?
Rapper Duo names: Paws and Claws, Paws and Claus (like Santa Claus, ya know, beards and jollyness), or Pause and Clause
Does anyone else get adhd vibes from evan?
dj resin pour
Evan saying "I think you're cool" has the same vibe as "mom, are you my friend?" "Y-yeeeeaaah..." 😂
its impressive seeing evan being so chill with his pour 💀and katelyn pulling an evan pour
meow
love the resin music in the background!
but wouldnt it get super stained by everything? When I have matte gel nails if it is light color they get stained by everything. I hope it holds up
14:30 i make website designs, video edits..... everytime i make something or edit something i also ask myself "well can i make this even more impressive." that's when things go derailing, luck for me i have Undo/history buttons....
Bob ross that u
Evan's (first)failure - for some reason - makes me feel like I have trypophobia
I just want to know if any of your windows are real 😭😭
HAVE YOU TREID A BAG OF DISAPOINTMENT?
I think evan and katelyn are secretly that couple who makes everything into a dirty joke and actually curse a lot behind the camera😂 they are def a good couple tho, I wish I had sum like theirs♥️
*really u did it well looks amazing not like been mobile case hahahahah*
Why the fake window?
25:57
rap name: Catnapper
You killed it with this top, the matte sells it and the glow is such a cool feature
Katelyn rapper name kate-kate duo name I believe you mean a duo rapper name so.. Evate
I don't know about resin much, but thinner veins of glow usually look epic for larger pieces like this
Evanandkatelyn16
1: the intro 2: "Fais moi, l'amour sir les toits de Paris!" means "Make love to me on the rooftops of Paris!" Guys, they're becoming that type of channel
What I thought about when you said dirty pour:  Katelyn: I'll do a dirty pour- Joobie: *walks in* Ill show you a dirty pour  K: Joobie no! J: *steps on the resin*
OMG the French subtitles 🤣🤣🤣
At 16:10 it didn't mean anything 🤣🤣 Google translate sucks for translations (i am french btw so it is why i know it)(if Google translate)
Did anyone else get visibly uncomfortable about Katelyns pigtails being uneven 😭
Ok ok ok here me out….. a resin BEDFRAME 💁‍♀️
its kinda weird Evan and Katelyn both have names that end pronounced "En / In " Just like Resin
haha I love the french part xD (I forgive you ;)
Your rapper duo names: “Kitty Kat and The Fuzz”
future proof . . . evan proof? also  in the hello fresh add i thought evan said ''you can get a three course *feel*''    not that type of channel
Blown away that the window was fake still
The subtitles in french where… questionable😂
I would have to take separate vacations or something as much time that yall have to spend together; married or not.
I tuned in to a resin video... and got something completely different...🤣😂🤣😅.
The bubble striations are just beautiful dear.
The dj soft paws bit had me laughing for way too long
“Why are you setting up a camera and lighting in our bedroom?”  “We’re finally becoming that kind of channel.”
Oh no our paint is broken 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:40 “It’s smart” My reaction:  I concur fine sir
This is really cool!!
I LOVE THE GLOW!! I want to do this to one of my stands, but I think I will leave it glossy and add a touch of silver sparkle.
You need to make yourself an awesome headboard for that bed.  Would love to see what you come up with.
I was thinking of trying to make thin marble inlay pieces with resin on my mantle..... now I'm wondering if I should. It couldn't be thinker than max 1/4 of an inch. And I can't do it on the mantle directly because it's vertical. I better buy a lot of resin to experiment!  Or I could buy marble, but where's the fun in that?? lol
1:06 omg she knocked him down and overpowered him
Has anyone ever thought about possibly making their own resin? Companies make it so it must be possible to make it at home.
fake marmol fake window
I cannot get over how annoyed su-purrr-visor Joob looked during the intro. "I am trying to enjoy MY bed, do your intro in the garage like usual." The pours came out SO good and the matte finish is PERFECT! I'm definitely going to have to try this now!
Evan: *casually turns of window* Ultimate DIY mastery
My mind went to the wrong places
it would have been awesome if you guys had integrated wireless charger in it! (I dont know if it would work through the resin though)
KATELYNS PROTECTIVE SHEETING ON THE RESIN MASK IS KILLING MY SOUL
Is it weird I just want to stroke the matte texture lik soo soft
How many different glow powder brands have you tried? Have you ever used photo chromatic pigments? I like Techno glow products.
The ‘ow ow Ow’ got me 💀
That looks really great, I like that you give the nightstands a new lease on life. Just a thought, next time you sand resin, perhaps do it indoors and use an extractor of some kind to prevent microplastics from getting out in nature :)
Yk what's weird though, Katelyn also used the universal tinting paste, so why didn't her black do the same thing as Evans? Like the only one she didn't use paste in was the gray. That's really strange
Why do you keep calling it a "dirty pour"? If you watch Stone Coat Countertop on YouTube that's how they make their marble looking tops by mixing multiple colors into one bucket and then pour the whole bucket and gives you a great looking marble effects.
Now that they've made resin into marble, they must now turn marble into resin!!!
the french XD
Lol those French subtitles tho-
It looks like you got it from a store
Is no one gonna talk about how jooby looked like a bat when she was laying on the bed in the beggining-
Ok anyone think it feels slightly illegal that there bed doesn’t have a headboard like what the heck
rap name for katelyn catrap
Rapper Name: Mlem N Mlem (Like the cat stuck out tongue thing)
your tables can dual wield between marble and planets and it's very cool
I got introduced to your channel about a month ago, and I’ve done my fair share of bingeing your content. With that being said, this is by far the coolest project yet. Your channel really helps me skip the fails a little faster by studying your wins and I appreciate it so much! I’m obsessed with your content😆
Rapper name for Katelyn- katcat
will you make your whole house out of resin
I love the fact that I have been here the whole time to see this Chanel grow like the first video I saw was in the old house 💜I cried when the moved too omg so many good memories there but omg im so glad
10:17 EXPERIMENTAL LADY
We need a matching headboard for the bed too!!
“The glow is making noises” 🥹😂 how can someone be so smart and so silly at the same time
currently crying over the french subitles x) oui mon amour, rejoins moi dans les rues de la ville de l'amour You can't make it more cliché
personally..i rlly liked evans 1st layer more XD
love the masks you guys worn
I am new to resin and have watched a few of your videos. I really enjoy them! I love the interaction between you. Keep doing what you do!
If I could offer an idea that I don’t believe they brought up. Could it be that the paint that Evan put on the bottom of his test caused the strange “alcohol-like” effect on the resin?
do you wish you had built in a wireless charger?
38:09 the window is fake and so's that door~
This video we saw the different sides of them that contained more of each other’s levels of chaoticness. It was interesting to watch. Plus the tabletops looked great!
I didn't expect to have an existential crisis while watching this. Am I real? Or am I just a brain in a jar hooked up to an endless feed of awesome crafts, mostly involving resin?
Was it the paint that you added before that caused @ all that weirdness on your bottom resin layer?
Words are hard is my is the world’s truest statement
Kaitlyn: “I need a rapper name”   Me: “ Little k”
Rapper name: Kat K
Lellelelelellelellelelellelel I think that its funny when Katelyn says "ow" and they use is for "resin time".
finally decided to google translate the french part. hilarious lol
Ok, I think I have some pretty awesome DJ names. DJ Toe and DJ Beans. DJ Beans because you guys like beans (flashback to the bean phone case) and because together it’s toe beans, the best part of any animal. I don’t know who would be toe and would be beans, but you guys can decide that.
Sur les toits de Paris il y a des pigeons et donc...des excréments. C'est pas très glamour pour faire des "galipettes" 😒😒 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cup Merch cup Merch cup Merch cup Merch!!! 🙏🙏
15:48      just me or did katelyn switch their cured resin layer  xD
Theory about the first layer of Evan'stest: what about the paint?
The part in french, I can understand all of it because I am french😆
am I wierd that I would break my arm to get carve and gold foil those faux tiles to turn them into wall art?
Idea: pumpkin for Halloween!
I already get hello fresh and it’s amazing
Wow!  I have a coffee table that my son broke the glass top of, and I have been considering trying resin on plywood to create my own replacement top.  I have a small side table I got for free that had the same type of glass inset piece and it is missing a portion, so I might experiment on that first.   This is very pretty and the glow would be a neat thing.
How much resin do you have.
I wonder if Evans first layer was messed up because he went back to it after it had already been sitting which the cure process would have already started whereas Katelyns was still fresh.
For my marble countertops I used white and gray marble effect spray paint over a mostly white resin design. Then sealed it. Looks awesome. You could use the black to get the darker look. I sprayed it directionally, not everywhere.
I agree with Evan. That couple was cute, not cringy! You guys are adorable. ^_^
Katelyns rapper name should be rappernapper
you should make a headboard to match the table drawers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Soft Paws and Chaos
Ok you are too adorable! My husband and I play along with each other like you do. 32 years and counting. I think we will last.--- terrific project!
How many times have you searched for things on youtube only to find your own videos? I know you did this with fixing drywall ones so now I'm curious
For ur rapper name is should be lil fluffs
Love them. Thank you for the video.
The resin reaper
I love how nice they turned out. I love how happy they are. They look like super cheap marble though. Real, but cheap lol.
I feel like going matte was the right way to go, looks amazing.
AMAZING!!!
I have an old table that I use as a craft table and I've wanted to do something with it for a while now......... You're giving me ideas 🥰🥰
that was awesome 😍😍😍
The sanding audio gave me goosebumps. T-T lol
Not Evan thinking the glow was making noise 😭
Wow the resin poor really looks nice
When I was watching the video out of nowhere I was thinking about rap names the first one come to mind rap cat I think it would be your perfect name for you Caitlin if you are a cat rapper also love your cat named June she is the bossKitty
Cuteness and Ham
Evan it's called White drizzle for your base so I love your videos and I love your cat jube she is the queen of ham
I loved the French part not only was it hilarious (since I speak French) but I had used the same music for a detective short film I made in college and I found that hilarious
This video had me thinking about all the marble products I have seen and if they are real marble or resin
Glove liners are so nice. They are very thin cotton glover that fit snug. Then you put your rennet gloves on and the just slide on.
we will never know if its night or day solders
I'd use the test pieces as picture frames to match
thought of this while watching: rEsIn HaNdS rEsIn HaNdS DO DO DO DO rEsin HaNdS

It is funny how they have a fake window shadow while showing the closed blind behind even🤭
Nice job, you guys really show how rewarding it can be to do it your self!
What did it say at 16:11
what i learned today, Even and Katelyn do not have windows .  they live in a box with no out side light.
HeH wE mAkE jOke🤪😂
french is my first language so i understood this bit 16:18 🤭
As soon as they started painting and resining, of course evan already wanted to do a chaos.
What do you do for your  mess ups
E&K: we did a good job. Me: with faking daytime lol
The blue looks like bioluminescent algae in waves on the beach!!!!
Kit-Cat Kate  (Super cool rapper name)

“resin time resin time ow ow ow ow resin time” merch request
2:00. Even tho I like a pitch black room sleeping 😴  22:34. What you doing 🤔😮‍💨  35:25. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏼👏🏼👏🏿👏🏼👏🏻👏🏾👏🏻  37:00. So what sand paper grit did you use ?  You did really good, loving the matt finish, not too much glow either
Just one question, on top of the resin buckets, or containers or whatever you call them , why are there cups? Love ur vids though
Katelyn DJ name suggestion: DJ Kaos
MC Hairball
I sent this video to my dad, he's a professional furniture restorer (not sure if that's the right word) and one of his specialties is faux marbling. He thought it was really cool and really wants to try resin now!
"Lil' Kate" great rapper name ^w^
No one is going to comment on the french subtitles? xD They are not children friendly, let's just say that
I would love an update on these, if they've held up good that'd be awesome
If you wanted a different look you can paint it then add a thick layer of clear resin and then paint another layer. I did this at an art camp and it made a really cool effect
notice Katelyn, evan mixed the resin on your side table
slowly devolving into that type of channel lol
22:50 is a funny spot.
Lil kitty Katelyn and da Young Chaos Boi
Rapper names:Mrs.Collected and Mr.Chaos
Omg I really love this one. Just have to be that buzzkill tho- anyone doing resin homewares please remember that resin off-gasses for months so if you don’t want to be breathing in toxic fumes while you sleep, please don’t put it in your room straight away!
i loved them! but i think i would choose the green glow in the dark powder
Wow that looks amazing. Thanks for this. I think I have a new DIY project
These two are adorable
brilliant😶‍🌫
You could have just removed the top surface plate and replaced it entirely with resin
PAINT EVIN USED PAINT
Eeeeee Katelyn you look so cute in pigtails
wait do they have adhd?? idk if that sounds rube it's not soupost to be
Those came out great!!
POV: you’re scrolling through the comments to find katelyn’s rapper name
For some reason I get hungry watching your resin videos because the reason looks like extra creamy cream (and I know I shouldn’t eat resin it’s bad for you)
Stone Coat Countertops has great videos on how to fake marble with epoxy
I have been binging this channel for a few days now and I love it so much. I live my best DIY-life vicariously through you guys.
You need a headboard and to make the dresser match!!!!

"The window is fake" 🤯 It totally fooled me lmao. Did you aim a projector at the wall with a slightly blurred grid of white boxes?
Rapper name for katelyn, Lil' miss perfect
Bro ive had a premonition of this video like 4 times wtf mega deja vu rn
I loved the veins that Ketlyn made! I liked hers better
Is it just me or as soon as they put on the lights it looked like the middle of the day 😂 lol
why not make resin tiles instead and then super glue them on. I guess that would take away from the intense-ness of the video and project but at least that way you could keep trying until you get something you like!
Wow!  Those look super.  Great job.
Busy doing CAD while listening to the show, heard the window is fake and replayed that bit, just to see the "Most Replayed" tag at 38:02 so evidently I'm not the only one :D
The French got me “I’m sorry France”
uhhh i didnt catch all the products you used for the test but that bubble looking effect in the pigment happens when paint pouring with silicone additives (its a cool technique when you actually want it haha) so maybe check if any of the paints you used had that or something im not sure lol it just reminded me of that so i thought id mention it :> dunno if i explained it well though oof
i misread the title as “restoring the future with resin” and thats the reason why i clicked BUT i stuck around LMAO
Honestly the fake window had me shook
Rap Names: Marble Master E & DJ PearlX
katelyns rap name should be lil.tbeans for little toe beans
Ok... I thought it would be kinda cool, but after seeing the glow... its DOPE!
How often do the glow in the darkies need to be recharged 🤔🤔🤔
I wonder how close in height they end up being side to side with the drawers aligned hehe
Those window lights are so cool! It's hard to replicate window light but to make it look like daytime in the middle of the night... that's so cool!
😹😹
😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣
Katelyns raper name should be Glitergang21
THEY LEVELED!!!!!!!!!
My rapper name submission is "Master Piece"
why does he sleep furthest from the door?? thats not very husband like
Fait moi COI? IM SORRY BUT THATS NOR VERRY KID FRIENDLY TOdo the adult fun on the roof of Paris xd
Chaos Even and Orderly Even have a sword fight, who wins?
As a french native speaker, I really liked those subtitles.

The spitting cat
Hajabababa _✨️stick✨️_
Rapper loud meows
The night table looks so good...it makes me want to do my too, LOL
28:41 don't mess with a woman's nice dressers
Katelyn’s rapper name would obviously be *MC* Soft Paws
Awesome results! It's a bit hard to tell, but if those are IKEA or other flat pack/self assembly furniture, which they look a bit like, you should be able to remove the top board to both make it easier to pour the resin, and you could also replace it with real wood. The double tape and plastic was a great idea that really paid off though, but before you revealed that it really worked, I kept on thinking that you should have disassembled them.
Rap name: Lil' resin, Evan would be lil' Chaos
This might be one of your best videos. Seriously.
Strong Black❌stronk Black✅
Lil' Toebeans And Evan‐m
The intro:hehehe jokeee Those who don't know:🌝 Those who know:🌚
The intro🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
I have started saying “I make joke” like katelyn
Ah, yes. Evan and Katelyn Pornhub channel coming soon.
16:20 LMAO THEY FOUND A WAY TO SWEAR IN THEIR VIDEOS  sacre bleu! Roughly means damn it
Everyone else: impressed by the crafts Me: HOW IS THEIR ROOM SO TIDY?!  (Just for the avoidance of doubt, I am also impressed by the crafts)
Why was Evan flipping me off 😢😢😢😢 it’s at 12:05
The rapping resin rascals
STOP SAYING O MY G O D
Please link the cringey/cute couple’s channel! Would love to see more of their content ❤️
Katelyn's her rapper name Could be K-Res
I have a rapper name for Evan! BIG CHAOS
I think this might be my favourite one just because of how difficult it is to pull off subtle. Was there a reason you didn't wanna pour the slab separate? Because you couldn't get it dead flat maybe?
You guys should make little coasters for your bedsides
they are beautiful WOW
As a French speaker I REALLY loved the French extra💀💀💀
Little bean should be your name for a rapper
you should do a radiation check..
8:34 just noticed that Katelyn still has the sticker on her face mask that you're supposed to remove before using it. 🤦‍♂️
I was making the same face specially wearing headphones made it soooo much worse! And when Evan laughed I thought “only an evil villain would like this sound” and Katelyn said “you’re evil” lol
Honestly, I'm in awe of how y'all can do this!
My mother and I have recently gotten into resin work, back in the day we did tri-chem and ceramics together and we wanted a different craft to do together. Both of us are really into tiny villages, especially fairy and gnome ones. I recently found village molds on Amazon so mom and I took to YouTube to see if we could find a tutorial on how to make one to steer us in the right direction. Come to find out, no one has made a resin village on youtube. You both have taught us a great deal about resin so we’d like to know if you can make a resin village so we can see how it can be done. Maybe that can help others who are interested in the same type of project. Thank you!
"Fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris" LOL that's not at all what you were saying in English, that I could not hear because I was laughing too much :)
How do you tell that both of the tables are the same layer
I liked this project a lot, nice work
I kinda want to do this to a dresser I have now
matching resin bed head?
Why are they eating tacos like that
Next project: a resin headboard
PLEASE IM FRENCH THIS IS HILARIOUS
DJ CATelyn :)
The pigtails r so cuteeeee
She used the heat gun in the beginning
Soo how long does the glow in the dark last? I would love to do this but if it only lasts like 15 minutes I don't think it's worth it.
This is reminding me that I would like my own marble table top to make chocolate on. 😁
Ok hear me out, UV light bulbs in the side tables so when you turn the lights off your tables glow every time
I am going to be so sad if they ever quite 🦋
I'm loving it. But I can't stop laughing because those helmets you're wearing are what the doctors wore in my colonoscopy. 😂🤣
Omg I’m watching this on a  Wednesday!
rapper cat Kaitlyn name!!! Lil claw
Katelyn's rapper name: lil pour
My ADHD: *Fluffy black baby, must look at the FLOOF.*
Can I just have a katlyn chanel......without even?
that intro- XD
Rapper names, les go. Katie Kat and Chaotic E
4:08 bob ross,
Conspiracy theory: they are in a high tech prison with no windows. They make due with their special effects and lighting to give the illusion they are free.
Ngl the new resin time is greatness lol
Xcessiv and Korshus
They had me with the fake windows tho. Did not expect that level of effort in the light setup.
Did anyone else hear evans voice change in the middle of the video?
39:00
I love resin for same reasons I did my counters and island by myself it was a nightmare lol got to fix a few edges still but overall I think I love them more and more as I look at them lol
30:44 DJ Pj slidez
really one of the best projects you guys <3
I love your editing! Your videos are funny and even sometimes educational, and don't forget the entertaining part!
Me chanting in my head “Please do X”  Evan: does Y  Katelyn: does X Me: YESSSS!!
Lil paws and lil beans! I feel like those are great rapper names for both of you!
"fais moi l'amour sur les toits de paris"  did you mean to leave that one there? lmao
DJ “CAT”elyn!
Imagine the ppl who got yall the tables get mad at yall
what is your ship name
Katelyn's rapper name would be sometbing like K-ontrol, because she so calm and controlled (mostly). And Evan's would be '3v4n in Leet Speak.' That whole thing would be his rapper name.
"Oops, I dripped"  "Noooooooooo" had me rolling
I like how they spend most of the video to make a practice and not much of the video for the real thing lol😅😆
MC soft paws and DJ sharp claws (katelyn is the mc cuz she's better at words lol)
matching resin headboard? maybe with no glow lol
Kaitlyn rapper named could katekat
They are such opposites and yet somehow they still get along.  Makes you wonder. Though Katelyn routinely looks upset at Evan in every video they are still making it work.
A name for Katelyn for her rapper name could be Kat Swatter, and then the duo name could be Etin &Keven  Kind of mixed your names together ^^                   🤌   Hope you like it 😁😁🤌                                                                   < ^>
super, super Cool !!! you guys, you did a great job (Y)
Evan: i did a Katelyn pour and Katelyn did an Evan pour.  Me: (hears Evan wrong) who is Adam??
It seems like they only ever do resin builds now
Toothpick! You should have tried using a toothpick.
My friend thought you were called 'Evelyn and Katelyn' when i told him about you so he thought you were a lesbian couple.
PLEASE use Ow ow ow ow resin time randomly! That made me laugh so hard XD
Best video of yours I’ve seen yet! Love the final product.
The intro was kinda sussy
Katelyn's wrapper name is definitely Skittles. Don't know why but that is it
You guys should check out stone coat countertops, they have a channel dedicated to resin. They do stone re-creations, step by step, it's super cool and I bet Supervisor approved!
I know it sounds crazy! But you can add a tiny bit of purple to anything off white or with a yellow cast to make it MORE white! 🚫🍋
20 minutes meals… trynna start a fight with Rachel Ray😂😂😂
I thought that bubbly resin thing looked cool!
It’s the resin rappers Evan and Katelyn
I thought the blacks would be too subtle once the top layer was on, and most marble is polished to a high gloss, but it looks fantastic.
I'm french and the subtitles send me 😂😂😂 But I love your videos !!
There are not enough french people here, the subtitles were hilarious
Rapper fluffy ears use is katelyn XD
Evan- Sometimes its black, sometimes its white, sometimes its in stripes, sometimes its in grids *image not found* Me- Lol
Ok, I really want to do this but I’m really curious about the total cost. Could anyone give me a general ball park?
16:09 , I like how I can actually read the french and burst out laughing when Katelyn said she used google translate because she didn't know french 😂
Duo name? Easy  "Sciencia-DJcents"
26:58 wo! j'ai entendu "la voiture" au lieu de "love, what your"
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate the French section? It starts out as a direct translation of what's being said aloud, but, progressively gets out of hand. "Fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris!" -> Do me the love on the roofs of Paris (very direct translation lol, it'd really be more like 'Make (me) love on the roofs of Paris'). Google translate is a gem.
but are their windows real tho? ...
Am i the only one who thinks she looks like Glitch from Wreckit Ralph?
The shroud of LIES in the lighting had me gagged.  Ive worked in film so i know, movies and tv do it. But evan and katelyn? Im impressed
Watching you do this makes me happy.
The suprise fake window at the end really blew my mind 🤯
Your rapper name name: Kevan Federham
make a headboard for the bed
Now you need matching headboard 😊
Resin time resin time do do do do resin time
My entire focus through that intro section was "white bedsheet, black cat, no fur everywhere????? How????"
I love your guys channel all your vids deserve more then a million views!! I have a question though,  is it alright if I make a fanfiction of you two maybe, chances are I wont get a reply but it will probably be like you guys making a resin craft and things like that-
12 seconds in and we can a clip to the "We're not that type of channel!" compilation.
Katelyn’s rapper name: the enforcer  Because I imagine she is the one that gets crap done!
Just saying, I'm literally cooking Hello Fresh while watching your video because I got your discount month ago. It's awesome.
をおおおお
Best project!!!
D O I T
i want to see you make enemies of eachother one video
you NEED to do a rainbow marble resin pour.
You guys seem like such a great pair adn your videos are really great! I love the funny editing too :) regards from South Africa <3
14:42 she says so happily
THIS IS REALLY COOL!
Gotta say though I hate the vibration in the voice when they where the masks. It makes my brain wanna scream.
I thought i was at the channel there for a second 😂
I love your personalities in your videos and your creativity slash obsession with resin haha! The editing is always soooo funny. Great project you two! The joke at the beginning was on point hilarious also-you two are cheeky cuties!
Why do you have window lights and where can I find them
That looks so, so good! Major upgrade and they should last!  Next project: headboard (maybe wood chevron painted white to match?)
I just stumbled across y’all’s videos. I’m 60 seconds in and I’m already obsessed with your personalities 🤣💕
Ok. BIG QUESTION. How is getting to sleep with glow in the dark tables. I make a glow in the dark bed ornament. It TORMENTS me. It had to go in the bathroom.
That was amazing! Sorry no ideas here for her rapper name, good luck. :D
Katelyn’s ye olde style and French subtitles was perfection 💀💀💀
Kaitlyn: I dunno
Evan being encouraging is just pure magic ✨
That’s so pretty omg, tbh I didn’t expect it to turn out so pretty. I really want one now, unfortunately I don’t do resin, anddddd I struggle buying something I like just to diy it.
You guys didn’t heat gun evans.. you didn’t get rid of the bubbles
30:45 Rapper Name: K-P (katelyn Paws)
You guys are AWESOME. Love your channel.
Lil resin
YOU HAD ME FREAKIN OUT AT 17:37 I COULDNT FIND MY STEAM NOTIFICATION
hahahahahah the French subtitles are brilliant! Thanks for the extra chuckle in an altogether really fun video :)
My brain stopped working when you turned your "window" off😂
Try experiment with density of the resin
Dj soft paws and Mr Fluff.
Actually we are all fake. You doing these videos for a bunch of bots with many many fake accounts, LOL Those turned out great and the glow is really cool looking.
For DJ name, one of you have to be Resinator X.
Are you able to sleep with them glowing like that. From the video it seems like they are kind of bright.
That Google translate French could have been way worse
2:25 (Marble is matte) Evan 2022
AWESOME!!!
for a rapper name do mabye lil kitten or lil resin
My toxic trait Is thinking I could do this
im not real i am a figment of yalls imagination (but you proplay dont know i exist soooooooo if you see this hi)
Hahah RESIN TIME RESIN TIME ow ow ow ow RESIN TIME. Hahahaha😹😹😹😹
DJ Toe Beans
So entertaining and such a gorgeous result!!
Absolutely love the finished product! Also, shout out to the Catio! I have three cats and they need one! 😆
I convinced my parents to get me resin? How you ask      RESIN TIME RESIN TIME DO DO DO DO RESIN TIME   I said that about 50 times
Stop I’m learning French and I was reading the subtitles like “that’s definitely not what they are saying.”
And she said” I had it PERFECT just the way it was then I went to go look for an extension cord so I could use a heat gun to pop the bubbles, but when I came back IT STARTED LEAKING”
My mom tried doing the marble rerun table tops but she used painters tape as a border and now resin is getting everywhere, and she always screams at the top of her lungs when things go wrong, and I told her that painter tape won’t work but she did it anyway
the do do do djs
Anger. Pure Anger. Evan JIPPED ME !! why didnt he just slap me right in the face. He gave us "oh no ! Our paint !" BUT NO "ITS BROKEN !" ...... Um excuse me ??? This is not what i signed up for when I subscribed to this channel. Do better you guys. SMDH.   Ps. Its a joke. Was I mildy upset ? .... Yes. Yes I was. Am i as upest as I made it seem ?..... Mildly. BUT THATS NOT THE POINT ! The point is that was a PERFECTLY set up punchline AND HE FUMBLED THE BALL.  .... Okay rant over.
Wait... the window was fake!? WTF!? When you guys turned off the window and broke the 4th wall of the 4th dimension of film, my brain melted.
DJ Resin Paw and the UV's
Do you guys use silicone mixing cups or do you just use plastic ones? And if you use plastic ones do you just through them out afterwards?
Soon their gonna have a house made of resin 😭
Wow you guys are really going all out with the fake window cookie (cucoloris). I know you stay up really late working on projects all the time but but I find it really funny that because of this you went and got such a niche piece of equipment
Fench Canadian here, the Google translated part made me laugh SO hard! Thank you for that!
Your rapper name should be. Lil katey
Maybe because the exothermic reaction was already started on the first pour, adding the black resin that had not yet started the reaction caused the bad results?
Amazing work ilove it
Hahahahah was about to comment that i remember their fake window in the bedroom end footage, then they revealed it hahahaha
Katlyn crunch wrap
Nobody: Me making potions at 3am be like: (6:56)
Here rapper name should be Soft paws with the claws
Okay but Evan’s idea to dirty pour with a blend of opaque and translucent white was damn brilliant. I would have never thought of something like that and now I have to try it.
through-back to when they did the resin bread. so long ago
12:13 I like it Picasso
So my birthday is in 4 days and I was going to spoil myself and get some resin because I've wanted it for years. Then my electric bill automatically pulled from my bank account and cost more than I was planning and threw me off. It works though because I realized I don't know what one I should get since I have to be able to work in my livingroom and I don't want to fume up my house and kill everyone. So, are there any suggestions for an affordable resin I can use inside? I'd appreciate any advice so I can go into it with some chance of success.
Omg. I never realized how much they've changed until they showed old clips 😳
The brief french subtitles absolutely killed me LMAO As a french viewer that was way too good and it was so funny
Turn the test pieces into tiny side tables for Joob's catio. Or bookends. They would make nice bookends.
God bless the blue tape creators. ❤
The lights aren't real!? This is a channel of lies!!! lololol
even when katelyn is chaotic and evan is controled she still rocks it
Rap name submission. MASTER KATE bwahawhawhaw!
can someone translate the french subtitles??? cuz i kno damn well thatw wasnt what they were saying
Put some string in the surface and pour it in the black pigment in the first layer, and the put the second layer then pull the string, maybe ot would help
Katelyn did you cut your hair??
Ok... I have a weird idea that I would like to exist and maybe you guys can make it happen....Scratching post side tables. Like a scratching post with a side table top to put things on to keep your cat from scratching and be able to put things on it. I've looked everywhere and cant find a good one! I'm sure you are the people who can make it happen :)
you guys should make resin straws
Rapper name for you guys as a dou “the soft pawed” sorry if its spelled wrong english is my second leanguage
I think because of the yellowish tone of the  glow powder, it looks more stoneish :)
it looks so good matte! marble is typically glossy, but it looks so much better imo!!!
Why is the words are hard a thing is it a joke or does he stutter or is he to focused
How much glitter is too glitter anyway?
The class-ification of glow in the dark ceiling stars you love to see it
anyone say  that evens "ugly mess up" was prettier then with out the glow resin?  🤔🤔🤔🤔P.S. I think even's is better then Katelyn's
my biggest flex is that i have been here since the ripple bench (4 years ago)
do white glow drty pour and teal veins
katelyns rapper name entry: Lil' crafty Paws
I had an idea!  What you could try is just doing one thicker slab of resin marble.  Then, after it’s cured, slice it depth wise so you can have similar/identical slabs for each side table.  Just like they do when the split marble slabs to have matching patterns.  Just a thought…awesome vid as usual
Katelyn: "It totally glows! It totally glows! It totally glows!" Says it all.
'Are any of the windows real, you'll never know!' Forgetting we saw their entire bedroom at the start of the video, haha.
The window is a lie 🎂
Katelyn rapper name: Lil' Whiskers Evan rapper name: Big Whisker
I would like to make a resin dining table top in the near future with faux terrazzo made out of polymer clay shavings/bits that have been baked. But my question is this, as you have both worked so extensively with resin can you offer any suggestions for subtle iridescent glitter ratios that have worked for you in the past. I am trying to make a "magical " background and want to compliment the colors I'm using without taking away from the terrazzo. Thank you for even considering a message back and hope you are well now.
Experimental lady™️ and Precise boi™️ need to be a skit
ow ow ow ow resin time ✨💫🕺
I couldn't think of a rapper name for Katelyn but I came up with a DJ name for Joobie. Ready? Drum roll please......DJ JooBeats
I was expecting when he said "Oh no! Our paint!" to say after "It's broken!"
"evan.. why are you putting a camera in our bedroom?.."  you have given up on the "we aren't that type of channel!" haven't you? 😂
katlyn's rapper name could be careful katlyn and even's could be even the kevin or even chaos
Make a resin nerf gun
I was SHOCKED at the fake window, how could you lie to us like this!? Hahahahah! Loved the tables, turned up much better than I expected!
going from flocked keyboard to classy bedside tables
At 22:56 the ratio of Evans chest and Katelyns hand 😳
dr kitten
NAH BC I GOT THOSE SAME HELLO FRESH TACOS AND THEY WERE SO GOOD
liking the new addition to the new times song 5:00
Sussy
I really enjoyed the video, especially the part were Katelyn came running in after Evan spilled the resin on the floor. A fun duo rapper name would be Fluff and Fur.
The sign in the background EK means ME in Afrikaans just thought I would say that
Katelyn rapper name: lil' whiskers Evan rapper name: Evan the chaos ( like Tyler the creator idk)
Oh, how cute! I love the glow! I WANT! Dang, guess I need to do that for mine.
Those look amazing 😍😍
I think a diy painting or big art piece hanging over your bed with the huge white space would tie the whole room together <3
I did not expect the face window XD great job you guys. Looks great
You should do Stainglass art with resin
I cant get the smile off my face, while watching your videos!
Lil paws
Pro-tip, if you're having trouble getting your latex or nitrile gloves all the way on, lift the wrist, blow into the glove like a balloon and release the air after you've slipped your hand into the fingertips.  👍
Kate kat/ Kate cat or kit Kat /kit cat.
30:45  DJ K-L-N & A-1 MC!!!   (bcoz your channel's name sounds like " A-1 & K-L-N " )
25:26 i haven't seen a pc-mouse-shaped sanding block like that before! looks kinda useful; where can i get one?
KT Cat Paws
I have noticed that there is no headboard behind ur bed
You guys should make a headboard out of resin!!
Evan is such a golden retriever husband. Y'all are adorable.
hi! as a person also named Evan i gotta say the hip hop community would be very confused at what you mean by saying "dirty cup". had to do it. you guys are amazing lol
Oh my God, NO ONE noticed Evan was going for the "OH noooo... our Table... its brokeeeen" Joke at 3:57 ?? :D
17:25 i'm jealous of your stove/range
So according to Google translate the captions in French are:   This proves it, this first my love, here my love, the first one I made, that's all Google translate sorry French people, that it was make love to me on the roofs of Paris!  They were both tube dips, my love.  damn it!
Y'all need to Apologize... Now you got me Obsessed with resin
i feel like he's secretly gay lol. no hate just the vibe im getting
One of my favorite projects that you've done! Looks SO good and i love the glow aspect!
When he turned off the window…. I felt that
I have an idea for a project. If you know the Sonic games them you can probably piece it together
next is "Making a Real House with Resin!"
they switched souls. I like reckless Katelyn! Or should I say experimenting lady. Katelyn quote #1: " ugh the hole thing is like really ugly :( "    Katelyn quote #2: " Im... SORRY OH GOD YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THEM IM Sorry environment! Im sorry :'( "  Evan quote #1: " Yeah, but mine looks goo hoo hoo ddd! (katelyn: How dare you :'> ) .  Katelyn quote #3: Wow thats a nice corndog. Evan quote #2: " OH LOOK AT THAT. GLORIOUS *evil laugh*. Evan quote #3: Still works. High RiSk HiGh ReWarDs. Katelyn quote #4: yes YeAS YEAS! (Evan: Thats it  (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)👌). Wow!. Evan quote #4: whY wHY WHY. High risk... High risk.(Katelyn: Its ugly now...)  *dies inside*. (Katelyn: Thats weird *Happy hers isn't the worst anymore* Its okay 😏) .  Evan quote #5: WhAt WhAht!?!?!?!? YOURS looks Beautiful.... *His mind: Jus' like yow 😌* .  AT THE END(Evan): Are you real?? Oh my! Like I- *has stroke* .
i love you guys so much
Now you need a headboard and some art
This isn't particularly different from their usual content, yet this video felt significantly better in quality and entertainment value than some of their other videos. This is exciting! Ps. I love the results of the project too :)
Yessssss NICEEEE
Resin time should be Katelyn's rapper name😆🙏🙏
Katelyns Rapper (or DJ) name should be "Meow-lyn"!!
I love watching you too together. Can't imagine one without the other. On everything you Yin and Yang well together. This was a classy project and a beautiful result.
The glow in dark would so keep me up at night. But I LOVE the effect.
After Evan added his glow layer it looked like Labradorite! Loved it!
DJ ForgetTaLevel Resin-dentChaos Lil GottaMakeDat Tiney Kat Pawz (edited the spelling)
You guys should freeze dry food, or make    “astronaut ice cream/food”
to those of y'all who don't want to look up what the french said, i have done the work for you:  this proves it this first, my love here my love the first one i did, that's all google translate, sorry french people that was make love to me on the rooftops of paris! they were both tube dips, my love damn it
Did you level it? 😹
You guys remind me of a family friendly Thread Banger. I miss them a lot however I can settle with you guys. Thread Bangers aren’t officially out of business however time between posts feel endless. Thank you guys for the great content, keep up these great videos. And editor, you’re amazing too
granted im watching this with poor audio quality, but is Katelyn ok? She sounds sick (again im listening with poor audio) and I just hope you guys aren't overworking yourselves.
Just use vinyl
he you are k ind of an idol fore me i watch all your content and am from Wisconsin so we are in the snowy winter so I that you could make a chia/foegaras rug with padio/deck cover
Katelyn, a.k.a. "DJ Soft Paws", a.k.a. "MC Skratchex, Queen of the Dripstep". BTW, have you ever thought of pouring a thicker color-patterned resin and then slicing it horizontally.  You could get some really nice book-matched pieces that way.
Rapper names!  Lil Evan and K Dawg in the house!
Anyone else follow them long enough to watch the transition from no makes to space helmets?
30:13 LUV IT 30:24
lol so karma got him for calling hers ugly lol
Do you regret glow in the dark furniture yet? lol
I really love watching them it all ways makes me happy☆☆☆thank you for makeing videos so interesting .I've been watching for 4 or 3 years💚
🕷🕸🕸🕸 hey Evan and Katelyn check out a cool and cute game called webbed in webbed you are a little spider who wants to (mini spoiler alert) rescue her boyfriend he explores everywhere looking for help :) 🕸🕸🕸🕷
Really enjoyed this Adventure with you.  Loving  this Awesome Project 😁
DIdn't even include a wireless charger in them?
Love how the turned out.  The glow is just an extra bonus.  Love how Katelyn put even in his place for the damage done to her side table
I wonder if it was the heat gun that might have contributed to the differences in the way the base layers reacted with the black streaks.
I think the differences between your and evans test was the heat gun maybe tho just a guess
What s cool project! They look amazing!
I did not see this project being supervisor approved?????
Katelyns rap name is Lil Peets 😂😂
Omg, the tables turned out so good, I love them. 😍
Hers looked like they were aiming for a galaxy look ..
Cat Kate? (As a rapper name for Katelyn.)  And Seven Evan? For Kevin, Katelyn, Evan, Fur baby, all the cat things that Joob fosent use. (idk how to spell fur baby's name😅) , the Bob Ross paintings, and allllllllllllllll the resin crafts .
Awesome job as usual!
Evan's rapper name can be beanz and katelyn's can be pawz!
I thought you guys couldn't get any better or funnier, I was wrong!
I don’t know how but I feel like each video gets better and better. I loved this so much
i don't think i can have a bad time watching your videos. constant good vibes
Dj resin time. Short classy, straight to the point. 😼👍
1 minute and 20 seconds in and Evan is already guilty for something.
Raper names: Raper kitty claws and Raper Saber tooth. You guys can chose what name you want/ who gets what name
Am I the only one that translated the French subtitles katelyn threw in there? 😅           They said this btw:  “This proves it. This first my love. Here my love. The first one I did. That's all google translate, sorry french people. That was make love to me on the rooftops of paris! They were both tube dips, my love. Darn it!”
AHHHHH Thank you so much for this!  My husband and I are starting a furniture refurbish company along with my epoxy tumblers and memorial art.  I was just telling him the other day that we can do resin tops on the dressers or tables instead of refinishing some of the wood ones!!! This makes me happy and I am so stoked that they glow.  I use glow powder in some of my tumblers so this was neat to see that modern twist on a classic look!!!
Katelyns rap name = K res
this is my request for “I’m also a cat” shirt because I will wear it 30:29
As a french speaker this was hilarous
Evan also did not use a heat gun and Katelyn did on the first layer.
I think a good name for your duo should be  Kaytlen: pink paws Evan: black claws So your duo name is pink paws and black claws
At the dollar tree they have metal trays!!! Like the one you were looking for at the thrift stores
You guys should play little kitty big city when it comes out
Oh my, these turned out amazing! I want them xD I audibly gasped at the first reveal of the matte finish on the first one
We make joooooooke
You guys should inbed a wireless charging into it and make like a cool mark on top so you know where to put your phone
Hello, friend. Very nice video. Thank you for sharing. Good luck to you.
You guys need to make yourself a super cool headboard!
Amazingly beautiful results.  I want one.
That should be a shirt. "Will it work          ...   I hope so"
This was so good
kaytlen the rapurr
You guys should try 3D resin painting
google translate tho
Hey bob ross
These look so good!!!
@evanandkatelyn Love the channel, my 6 year old can tell what we are going to watch just by seeing your shop. I'm a woodworker and my wife got me one of your (resin time) hoodies (super comfy by the by) but I had an idea. If you make a hoodie so you can close off the pocket it would be awesome.  When I'm turning on a lathe alot of the chips and dust gets into the pocket and is really hard to get out. Just a thought. Thank you for the content and keep them coming!
I say Kevin instead of Evan
Wow. Those looked so great. Like, mind-blown-great.
Okay hi I have an idea and no clue if it’s actually do able: some sort of resin armor? You were talking about how strong it was, and I immediately thought “resin armor”. Again, no clue if it’s possible I don’t really know much about resin, but it would be so cool.
At 31:00, I was just waiting for Evan to drop the camera in the freshly poured resin. As he was waving the camera to and fro above his nightstand.  Loved the journey, as well as the finished product!
I wante to translate the french old tv joke so heres the french:  cela le prouve ce premier, mon amour ici, mon amour Le premier que j'ai fait, c'est tout google translate, desole les francais  que c'etait  fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris! ils etaient tous les deux des dips en tube, mon amour  and heres the google translation (with no added words from me) this proves it this first, my love here my love The first one I made that's all google translate, sorry french people  that was make love to me on the rooftops of Paris! they were both tube dips, my love
Marbel bedframe
finally. the cure's 1981 album faith in bedside table format
Non UV protected resin ..I  assume .... UV needed to charge glow powders ?
am I the only one who was laughing at the french subtitles? non? just me? aksks
this whole episode has been CHAOS KATLYN!!! I LOVE IT We need more chaos Katlyn in the world!
I think Evans liquid black has silicone in it. That what forms the cells when you use the heat gun. That's what you're supposed to do with acrylic pour ;) Not just blow the paint around but heat it to trigger the cells to form.
This window is a lie!!!!  I can’t!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THESE LOOK SO GOOD OH MY GOSH \(*0*)/ SERIOUSLY AMAZING!!!!
You guys should try making a projector 📽
That's so weird, I was hoping you guys would re-visit the marble pour!
I like how katelyn needs to look up at Evan
SO GOOD! <3
Was anyone else thinking they should have just made a resin block to put on the dresser instead of doing it straight on the dresser? Like so they could remove it when wanted or make a bunch of different ones to change out when they change up the bedroom decor.
:Evan comes into frame “probably particle board” I couldn’t help but to laugh hard😂😂 love you guys!!
The fake window sent me lmao
Where is your supervisor
There the reason total boat expoy will not go out out of business
Kitty Chaos and the Mischief Man
I loved the resin time remix
ngl I like Evans first test pour the most
Honestly tho I feel like you guys could start a cooking channel, cuz that hello fresh commercial was beautiful
I find it funny how Evan is joking and throws an edits a fridge when he throws his hand to the floor in the intro
No heat gun used on his in first layer...could the unpopped bubbles have caused the look of his?
mY gLaSsEs, I cAnT fInD mY gLaSsEs  					  -  Velma D
WOW!! That looks soooooo good!!
Y’all should make a matching headboard!
Does Joobie like meowsic?
i always thought that katelyn was fun sized but turns out evan is family sized
surprised they didn't add a wireless charger
Ok… who caught all the French subtitles? All I saw was google translate. Lol
You are a missed opportunity you should’ve put a wireless charger inside of the resin
I think instead of glow pigment, I would have just added dim LED strip lighting under the resin piece. It would shine through the resin and be a nightlight you could turn off and on.
Imagine waking up one day and Joop scratched those up making marks
For the rapper names (duo) chaos couple
i would love to see some experiments with biodegradable resins and plastics because of the environmental impact of normal resin!!!! good video <3
Can you please do a resin backpack 🎒.?
I am sooo the type of person to be bothered with things out of place LOL I think it comes with being a Caitlin/Katelyn!
Katelyn: Why are you setting up lighting and cameras in our bedroom? 🤔😏 Me: It's NoT tHaT kInD oF cHaNnEl!!!!
“I don’t like double gloving, you know that!”  -> Proceeds to demonstrate one of the reasons to double glove
The steam message during the ad sent me
That is totally sick, guys! Love the design of the marble
glow in the dark how the hek you gona sleep
Katelyn fully embraced her inner chaos in this video
Wow you guys did a great job 👍
Have you guys ever tried 3D Resin printing?  It seems like something right up your alley.  :D
Died at the side Evan in 25:00 with the particle board joke, great edit😂😂😂😂
Wow. You guys did an awesome job! 🙌
30:45 Katelyn’s rapper name?  K-EZ? (kay ee-zee) Or maybe K n’ EZ?
THE WINDOW IS FAKE????
Yes hello fresh is really good and I love it!
French viewer here, your subtitles were so fun, it makes me laugh so much 🤣
Katelyn made a comment about the environment when she opened the trash can full of gloves. Isn't resin just hardened plastic? Your projects are cool and the process is fun to watch, but do you guys ever think about all the plastic you're making? Let alone everything that has to be discarded after touching the resin? The cups, the gloves, the paint brushes, the syringes, the mixing sticks, etcetera.
I'm sorry, the video is great... but the funniest part for me was the French subtitles (I'm French) especially the few sentences in there that had nothing to do with anything you were saying LOL
That was awesome. Do a headboard for your bed to match!
Rapper duo name: CatKate & Chaos
Didn't Katelyn also use the heat gun on hers? Wasn't that also a difference as to why hers remained as "lines" where as Evan's turned more "bubbly"? That is my thought on the matter. May have to test it with a future resin time! ;)
The best method I've seen and used for a countertop is a layer of pearl white on top of a black base then running a paint stirrer stick through it to bring the black to the surface making it look more natural when it cures
You have to work down the grit grades. Start with the 800 then work down to 2500
The aqua glow power vains in Katelyn's tester piece remind me of minecraft.
Katelyn made me so nervous in this because she was Evan chaos so so so so SO much!
doesnt matter how much evan's pour looks good, at the end of the day it will always turn into a evan's pour! LOL
I unsubbed a couple of years ago some every video was ONLY "resin this, resin that". I figured I'd check y'all out. Nothing has changed. Y'all really deviated from woodworking which was how y'all got started and "grew". Now y'all are wearing $2k mask to breathe air 😳🥴. Buji like bosses. I really used to like y'alls channel. Now it's all resin day in and out b/c resin is so affordable to the common folks who don't wear a $2k mask.
Omg the French captions 😂😂
i think another problem was the spot you poured the second tube bit is it was the last part you poured so maybe it was still in the middle of curing?
at around 27:42 idk if it seems like it for anyone else but evans voice sounds nasily and he sounds a bit sick- it could be the mask but on the second pour his voice sounded normal  if you are sick get better soon ☺︎︎ *Pats for the Joob ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ*
stone cutter resign is good too
OMG!!! They made resin labradorite!!!!!! @23:30
It would also be cool if you guys found a way to put a wireless charger inside the resin!! Also I love your channel!!!
I love how the French subtitles had absolutely nothing to do with the conversation 😂😂😂
early on in katelyns pour hers had a familiar shape. guess when you let your subconscious guide your art...
I’d paint the tables edges with glow paint and then do a few “ veins “ or lines of it in a middle layer I’d also do thinner layers/ more layers
Where do you buy your resin? (If you don't mind me asking)
Here’s a little tip — something that I’ve learned from my own experience working with resin: if you get just a little bit of resin on your fingers, instead of pulling out the rubbing alcohol or acetone , you can clean it up with hand sanitizer
So I was trying to find this video earlier today but i couldnt find it. Was that just me? Am I going crazy?
Have you guys checked out the Stonecoat Countertop folks? They have some cool techniques you might like!
0:07 😳
i was expecting evan to say "are we real?", totally wasn't ready for "are you real?" lmao
Katelyn's rapper name would be something like K-Dawg but cat-based, so like Calico K (or Kalico K)
Ah another evan and Katelyn video, nothing out of the ordinary  Clicks video 0:03 - 0:07 🤪  Vivid memory of them saying  "Were not that type of channel"   Screams in bri ish  "Oh good heavens"🧐
Unpopular opinion: this isn’t the best main channel edit. I’m confident this isn’t a Katelyn edit, which is fine, but I think the editor turned it up to 11 on the jump cuts and effects. Let more of the quirky banter shine through. Story telling was heavily front loaded. I’m not bothered by the run time (I regularly watch 3hr+ videos), but this one seemed to drag on.
See coke bottle at 9:56
At this point I’m convinced that Evan and Katelyn just say “we ARE that kind of channel” when the cameras are off.
Glow in the dark bed side tables sounds like an _awesome_ recipe for never sleeping again!
Omg that french part 😂😭 being french, I'm telling you that channel isn't that family friendly anymore and I'm not complaining lmao
Next time: Include wireless charging pad underneath resin!
Katelyn’s rapper name should be “Dr. Lil Paws”
how do you even think to have a fake window light? that wouldn't have even crossed my mind
Those are WICKED
Okay this is pretty awesome honestly!!!!! I LOVEEEEEEEEE how glowy they are!
Omg I love your kitchen backsplash! Did yall do it or was it like that when you moved in?
Plot twist: there are actually 0 windows in their house because they live in an underground bunker. The garage doors are more of the tricks
the start kinda sus hmmmmmmm
Head board done the same way to match the night stands?
“Its future proof” but is it Evan-proof?
Hey guys, have you thought about getting Evan a little tray with rubber inside or use the marble tray for his side? If it's rubber inside no dropping sound issues if keys are dropped on it.  Helpful ideas?
Thank you so much for giving me the inspiration to continue my resin projects that I have been struggling to complete ☺️
It looks so professional!! Y'all killed this omg
I am now convinced that Evan and Kateyn live in a windowless house 😂
They turned out sooooo good!!!! Please make a matching cat-sized one <3
What’s up with the mask. My hospital can’t even get those
I like your videos  Also I have been looking for a Glow Powder that is a reasonable price  As I will be using it to tint Epoxy I cast for fishing plugs
Supervisors Dj name should be “Dj Void Paws”
Just waiting for “We built a house out of resin”
THE FRENCH SUBTITLES 💀💀💀
Can you make merch that says successd❌ Fail❌fail then succeed ✅
That was cooler than expected
i haveee a rapper name   Lil Kat    :D
For the initial under painting that Evan tried...  If you did a base coat of white that might have helped keep things light, like with Bob Ross and his liquid white coating on some of his paintings.
I actually think that the yellow tint of the glow powder really added to the "real-ness" of the marble look, kinda making it seem more natural and not "pure".
The uneven pigtails are bugging meeeeee. ...Maybe I should test for OCD.
RAP NAME: kitty, literally.
The cut off "Oh no!    Our paint!     It's broken!!"  cracked me up 🤣
DJ Resi Res
Mow
16:12 lol Katelyn I never thought you were like that 😂
Here are my rapper name entries so for Katelyn it is "MC Meowster Catelyn" and for the duo it is "Evalyn the Resinstic Duo" and I have 1 more and it is for Joobie it is "Mix Meowster Joopurrvisor" hope you enjoy the rapper names you guys
Evan casually flips us the bird @12:06
I want this, this might be my favorite thing you've ever made
TIL: what face to make when someone says “this is cathartic” 😅🥳
I want the Resin Time jingle as a ring tone!
Rapper K.T. Cray Cray
...is the room even real!?!
if its particle wood it's not expensive
Maybe get uv lamps?? 🤔 I mean they give me a headache but could charge your tables well....
DJ Soft Paw's hardcore rap persona, MC Kitty Claws
Rappername suggestion: Lady jesus (ofcurse) or pyamas queen or cheeto Q-crust.... Hahah i dono. Fun vidoe and soo nice result! :D
I’m french, and I was like *wait is that French 🤨. anyway nice video as always keep up 👍
We make joooooke..... MMMMHMMMMM
You should do the same marble to the draw fronts so that it all look cohesive
You should make all of your dinning room chairs mood rings like the toilet seat...
Is that resin time on ur patreon as a ringtone?
💚Nice💚...I'm also luvin the Covid helmets...😁
oh my god the "image not found" !
Every time they expose their fake window light I start questioning everything 😂
i'm french canadian and those subtitles killed me ahHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
I’m so glad I can read French, that was so funny
I like Katelyn's the best
What are the masks for
its funny to see that you guys take on this project like i would paint marble. i learned it from school with the layers and how you need to built up that layer effect on a flat piece of paper.
Looks great. Does it bother u when going to sleep
Your rapper duo name is "Chaos and Design"
For a duo rapper name you two would be Chaos beats.
HAHAHAH THE FRENCH 😭🥲 that was so funny 😂
Evan: Are you strugglin with sad- Me: yes. Evan: -boring food? Me: ...Oh. woops.
one of the most all together polished builds you have ever done! they look great!
Wait how did I miss this
argh... the colour bars and 1khz tone has returned...
rapper name "lil resin feline"
So it wasn't a reaction to the paint on the test piece..?
Hey E&K big fan of ur work. Jst to let u know we brits came up with the catio idea first... for babies!  Multiple floors up! Baby in a cage: pent house, check it out
In between the layers, you should have included little label embeds that have your names so that you never forget to swap the nightstands if you swap sides of the bed.
Katelyn Imbracing chaos and those turned out very nice
I loved that Evan's Katelyn's roles have switched. Chaos became Katelyn and caution became Evan xD
0:01 Clint Barton (Hawkeye ) moment :  Don't give me hope.
holy moly these look so beautiful, great job you guys!!
The last black streak is like doing your whole eye makeup perfectly and then messing it up with eyeliner.
Rapper names: Twix left and Twix right
That original marble video was what introduced me to the channel
That french translation was epic
I love Kaitlyn's glow veins on the test piece.
14:42 “it’s so ugly now” states passive aggressive katelyn
DJ Soft Paws, ft. Lil Whiskers (aka my suggestion for your rapper name) 😂❤️
I totally did the slow golf clap with you guys... So much fun watching your videos!!!
Do do do resin timeee
Your rapper names should just be "Part A and Part B" and every album is a "mix tape".
I'd hit the bell icon for that intro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Smooth, Katelyn, very smooth ...
As a French person it wasn't the best translation but nice effort, still kind of work
I did not expect that window to be fake 😂
U could paint over them
Those turned out amazing 0.0
evan and katelyn: switch sides because evan's shoulder hurts me: just... roll over???
That looks noice
THE FRENCH SUBS. I. CAN'T. BREATHE.
it's Joey Tribbiani French subtitles!
Wait, wait... Floor made out resin, with your own disign....?
At 23 they reveal the glow and I’m instantly like. Ok Evans glow is awful and Katelyn’s is awesome.. then they both agree Evans is better and I’m like “wait.. what???”
what happened to his voice? surely im not the only one who noticed the sudden change in evans voice
Ow ow ow ow 😆
We all need a little more chaotic Katelyn in our lives
Wow, this is one of my favorite videos of yours! The ambition! The sass! The editing! The marble!
those respirators go for more than  TWO GRAND?!?  EACH?!?
Genuinely impressed by the fake lights haha
Towards the end. I thought all that was natural sunlight lol .. put the link to those lights!!
very good French, oui tout à fait
I would commission you guys to make so many things for me if you let me, lol. Those turned out so cool! =D
"fais moi l'amour sur les toits de paris!"  😳 I thought you guys weren't that sort of channel!
my acrylic nails are aqua glow. its the same power you used
I keep thinking that the Joob plushie is Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon
Now i want a fake window :c
What if you guys after a poor and its dried you indent it and fill it with a gold metallic
If my husband was ruining my furniture even after I commented on it I think I'd mysteriously not have a husband anymore....
We’re all a bunch of Evans looking for our Katelyns.
You guys should do a mood ring toilet to match the toilet seat hehehehehe
I love this new vibe very positive
You guys are getting so good at this. I was worried that your first layer on the tables didn't have enough black. I was wrong. Looks great.
Rapper name- K Res
Katelyn's rapper name is Kandy Wrapper. Sweet lyrics that make you sick!
I love that I'm both of them, like I 100% would have also said the paint was in pain and whenever my husband has issues with words, I always finish his sentences as well.
The fake window blew my mind.
Katelyn rapper name Stank-lyn  Katelyn's first album name Ain't No Resin For The Wicked
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹    IMPURRESSIVE JOB,E&K~!!!;"3 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
These turned out so good omg
Even sounds a little sick.
Sacre bleu REALLY got me omg i cannot
Katelyn you are flowing in this episode girl 🔥🔥
For their first pours I think Katelyns ended better because she used a heat gun
That's actually super cool great job you two
Having the lamps on the table sure charges it a lot more then the uv flashlight. They turned out GREAT!
THAT'S SO COOL
35:22 … I totally clapped with you 😂🤣  Well done guys, well done. 👏👏
I know rapper names!  For Evan: chaos bean For Katelyn: order bean  :)
Here is a rapper name for you both. Katelyn - "Lil Rez" and Evan - "DJ Deep Pour". Ijs it may be time to drop that mix tape
There Even and Katelyn proof
Rapper name: Lil doot
Reminds me of acrylic pouring. I like that! PS: You guys are SO stinking adorable! <3
My husband works with resin professionally. He was cringing at the dirty pours because his job is to do perfectly clear and gloss pours.   I do think you did a REALLY GREAT JOB!   And shout-out RI and Jamestown Distributors ⛵
Okay I gotta say this, the way they made the sanding machine humm with the background music is so satisfying  Top notch. Normally when I watch youtubers when they don't cut the audio of their power tools it clashes with the music this almost HARMONIZED.  Also these people are such an adorable couple I think yous got a new sub from me! :D
Spitten Kitten and Evan-tually
wouldn't commission this because I like to sleep in total darkness but OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!!
Bro Evan sounds exactly like like my dentist wtf 😂
Resin yellows 😬
💕 them!
Should have added cordless phone charging while you was at it 😀.  Then the led light in the charger would make the top glow different/ more/better lol.
Aquaaa
I hate how empty there room is
Katelyn- Resco  Evan- Resno
When are you going to try Stonecoat Countertops??
I actually really liked how the blue looked, much better than the white glow.
Oh my gosh! It looks absolutely incredible!!
I was watching this and my brain came up with this  rapper name: order, chaos, and the supurrvisor
January 31 is opposite day.... WAS THIS FILMED ON OPPOSITE DAY?
the noir section was hilarious
Oh my goodness Katelyn is so adorable with those pig tails( I think that's what they are called). This was such a fun video to watch!!!!
I wonder what supervisor thinks seeing her humans getting so excited over two tables
random thought: you guys should totally make rice crispies with kraft dinner 💀💀 some with and some without the ✨ cheese topping ✨
4 years of Public School French classes has prepared me for 16:00
Rapier name K8-Land
I’ve never had more of a crisis than when Evan turned off the window light. I was so shook
I wanted marble on my bedroom furniture but I used some contact paper
*Husband & wife handshake*
Ok I'll admit it. Although I Love your projects, with this one I was sceptical. Thoroughly proven wrong!!!! Those are fantastic
I did mine like that too but the glow got covered. If u put a light close it glows🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m happy with it
looks really nice! Great Work!
the badly translated to french god me good
The film noir edit when Evan was explaining why his pour looks bad, that's so funny. Your editing is always so funny and inventive.
So what sanding did you end up doing for that finish?
Looks stunning 🤩
These two are too freaking adorable AHHH
Great job again! Loving the projects! You should look into a pourable material called Jesmonite. You could create some amazing galaxy / marble furniture. Evan would love the fact you can crush up bits then add that to your next pour to create some amazing patterns!
DJ Soft Paws and CD Evan! [CD stands for Crazy Dog] Mini Meowza and Diggin' Doggos [if you have not noticed, I see Katelyn ad a Cat and Evan as a Dog lol]
Evan the furniture abuser. Furniture run for your life
This is awesome editing!
Your rap names: Free-Flow Order and The Towering Chaos
Those seriously look great!
Why are you eating tacos LIKE THAT, guys?! 😂♥️
Cute Katelyn
30:35 looks like DJ Softpaws has a tail! (connected to the mask!) Y'all are awesome! I would love to find a partner to play w like y'all do! I don't know anyone else who likes to play w resin as much as I do!
dj kk (kay-kay)
I was not expecting that surprise window reveal 😭  The windows are a lieeeeeeeee
A quick but effective way to matte the finish of resin AND give it scratch resistance is to use this urethane top coat from Leggari or Stone Coat. They offer a "gloss" finish that won't be nearly as glossy as resin, or a natural finish that is matte. Prep is quick too, sand to 220 mix a *small* amount and roll it on. Works quite well. The Stone Coat folks offer their UTC in 50$ bottles, bit it lasts for a decent number of projects. Leggari does more bulk orders.
I had to pause the video during your sponsorship add to check my Discord...  ...blast you. :-/
big reveal... Evan and Katelyn are living in underground lair! *dum dum duuuummmm*
I suppose DJ Soft Pawz rapper name could always be The Kat 🐱
Nice work guys! Next up a headboard for your bed… * wink wink* 😁
When Katelyn said "my glasses" it reminded me of Velma from Scooby-Doo
You come as a rap duo: Katelyn - Lil Calm Evan - Lil Chaos
Poor Joob going through fake windows to get to her catio.
Is it just me or did Evan's voice get deeper on the first poor to the nightstands?
you would either be lil' kate or lil'space cat
When the test pour took more than half the video 💀💀💀
the french bit made me laugh soooo hard
I'm so happy y'all did this. I just got some furniture from my grandma and I wanna do something fun with it and this is a great idea
Omg seeing French in your video made me laugh so much ahah Perfect translation (from an actual French professional linguist) ahah Sending love to you two ❤
Those turned out amazing! The only thing I think could make it even better, is if you made a matching headboard. 😊❤️
CoolCatKatelyn :D
what in the minecraft
Katelyn, I know what your rap name should be... Lil'Res  Lil- beacuse it's common for rappers  Res- resin :)
Katelyn is obviously Lil Katty, and Evan would be King Chaos :'D
Katelyns dj name is <3
Make a Joob sculpture out of wood?
Lil Softy Paw and Lil Hardy Claw
Katelyn & Evan rap names: -Lil´ K  &  Big Resin -KT Lean  &  Evant Garde  (like avant farde but evan) -Not That & Kinda Channel
The "ow ow ow ow" in the resin time theme really caught me off guard 😆 I didn't know what to expect from the glow in the dark element but omg, stunning!
Are you guys didn't change personalities/bodies when you got sick? 😆
To be honest, I kinda liked the teal glow powder more. It looked less perceptible when it's not glowing, and it gives a fun twist
If I watch one of your videos I will watch them all the rest of the day
Favorite Evan quote if this video: "what a journey this has been on" 😁😂🤜🤛
Matching headboard????? No ok, I'll mind my business
the sanding made such a big difference!
You should regrout the tile on the drawers with white sparkle grout!
On most youtubers I just skip sponsored sections but you guys just make them so cool and interesting to watch
Man, I love Italian Spider-Man
Woooow, the tops look sooo goood! +______+ Such an improvement to your earlier marble pour projects ;P
apologie Accepted xD google translate is great
Rapper name : lil paws
I have a question are you guys Patt and jen? because well..... you guys are like I dentical
Loved the Bob Ross reference
Evans looks exactly as I expected; that Ikea peice that everyone's been touching, sitting on, and rubbing (their and their child's) grubby mitts all over for the past 5 years. Cause that's exactly what my brother (also of the chaotic, tall guys with e names club) Ethan does.
I met a bull in a china shop and he said he thought Evan was a bit much.
You guys are wearing dust masks.  They are not meant for using with resins.  🤦🏻‍♂️.  You need respirators.
The yellow tones from the glow powder actually brings in real tones that exist in natural marble.
40 liters of resin Greed and Cheese are Glowing can you here the Grapxics glow and Chill Babe fresh milk for 5 Puppies withe Mohawks and Bamboo roll up shades Lorenzo does make good zaaa tho thx
Fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris ahahahaha oh you guys are so cute :P ( translation ; make love to me on the roofs of Paris )
Mc Toe Bean and Tuna Paté
30:44 Dj Soft Paws and Chaos Maker in the house.
I have the exact same nightstand and I can verify they dent and scratch very easily. Doing a resin coat is a fantastic idea!
Rapper names lilPaw and Big Snoot I expect some bops from you 😂
I don't know why "ow ow ow ow Resin Time" is so funny to me but I just love it! 🤣❤
Im french and this is hilarous 😂
As cool as the final result was, I bet you could have added a wireless charging pad under the top layer to make it even cooler. Love the design on these for sure!
I know it's not that kind of channel, but I'd really love a haircare routine from Katelyn. Her hair is GORGEOUS, but never looks deliberately styled, what sorcery is that?
Dj Res & Lil sin
Im suprised nobody is taking about the “resin time! Resin time! Ow ow ow ow, resin time!” That just cracked me up 😂
My suspension of disbelief gutted when you removed the fake window and then turned it back on
Ok rapper names, turkey and hamm
Wow those- those are amazing! They literally are so cool and good looking! You guys did amazing, wow!
You guys could be m and m... like get it? Like m&m’s the candy but m and m as a rapper duo?? That could be cool
your rapper name can be lil paw beans i love this so muchh
Man i love these resin videos and they inspire so much! Thank you guys for just being you<3
"DJ Soft Paws and DJ Sharp Claws" just fits too well.  A funny rapper name could be "Lil Whiskers"  All keeping with the cat theme
best thing yet LOVE LOVE LOVE
I'm praying that they use coasters so cups do not ruin the tops
Suggestion for a rapper name: "drizzle rezz (in)" 😅 and the member´s name´s are: "lil´chaos pawz" and "lil´ soft pawz"
Well, is it distracting when you trying to sleep?
Fun. But WAY TOO MUCH background carnival music. 😢
26:58 This is so cute im shitting
There making a sex tape.
They look INCREDIBLE!!!!
For some reason the resin in this project really awakens the “good soup” instinct within me
Notification Squad!!!  :D
I would love to know how you keep your pure white bed covers clean with a black cat
lil Kate the rapper
Lil Kate
DJ kitylyn
Turning off the lights absolutely SHOOK me.
i wasnt the only one who translated the French part in google translate to see what it means even though I'm a french student, right? .... right? 😅
This project was so freaking cool! Nice work. 😎😍🤩
Did the game channel editors edit this one? The little extra at the end seems like something they’d do
lmao watching people have minor creative breakdowns really fuels my creativity
I love the clean look of your room. It would be so cool to see what your creative minds could do to spice that wall up!! :)
Katelyn’s rapper name sound be Lil Soft Paws
Love rhat in thier add for hello fresh they cant really use resin so its not wasted so she uses water
I like Chaos Katelyn's style
you guys should try this project again but with the glow resin as the base layer and then put the streaks on top to allow them to pop!
Great job!  I love the matte finish.
The *Image not found* freaking broke me. I'm crying laughing.
I am VERY impressed with how realistic these turned out! Fantastic job!
Sir Supervisor and the Resinettes
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE VIDEOS YAYYYY ive been watching old ones lol
Your videos are very relaxing for me. 💖🤙
evan's proof furniture
Those really turned out awesome!
Katelyn Rapper name: Lil Kat =3
Those looks so friggin good holy cow!
First off, the tables look beautiful, and that matte finish 😍 but, I need to know where they got that fake window reflection light from, it's beautiful!
it might have been neat to push the tables together so it looks like the tops came from one slab that you split in half for the two sides
needs home depot music
Rapper duo name: Evyn and Katelan
"Resin time! Resin time! _ow ow ow ow_ Resin time!" WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS
Kate-Cat
I clicked on the video because it looked like you had lesbian length hair lol 😆  i was like no way she is married
Evan breathes like he has a bag of pennies in his throat jeez
I love your desk but now you have to make wall art for that very plain wall
Missed opportunity to put a cordless charger in the top!
Those look fantastic!
What is that WHITE SQUARE IN THE CORNER OMG
I love it! It’s so cute.
Someone who speaks French, please translate the noir subtitles. There is absolutely some hidden comedy in there!
I just thought he was filming Joob.
My rapper name is The Plain White Rapper.
9:00  “Ah that is a nice grey, I want that on my walls.” **looks at my walls** “Oh yeah.”
LOOKS LOVELY. Imagining it with walnut drawer fronts. ZOMG
lil paws as a rapper name? 🧐🧐
So you want them classy when the lights are on a freaky when the lights go out...... I like where your heads are at **wink wink**
Katelyn’s rapper name should be Lil’ Whiskers (like a kitty!!!)
ayaaa le passage en français
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU CRAZY KIDS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ <---- see, that's a lot of love !
DJ Kat Skratchez and Ev-Man.. you're welcome. BTW these turned out great. You must be confident in your resin skills to tackle bedroom furniture you'll be looking at every day.
What a fun project! They came out great! And well done to the editor--all those little touches add so much fun to the video =)
I love your honesty about being unsure of how to do something and forging ahead to create something beautiful. These turned out fantastically!
I'm pretty sure you are getting "cells" in your resin black and white colors is because the pigments are made with actual ... Pigments. And those all are made/created differently, therefore they have different weights. Maybe try all liquid resin colorant. Or maybe (doubtful though from my experiments) all powdered.  But look into pigment suspension weights in resin. All I know is that whatever I did my ocean wave tables, I didn't have "cells and bubbles" until I added a liquid white pigment into resin and then added that to my blue ocean.
Hi I am Perla you're both sooooooooooo fun and funny. And a great couple
I'm still not over the fake lights at the ending
The window is fake...  crisis mode activated
Ow Ow Ow Ow is not a good sign
You know I would love to be able to invite people over and just be like I made this this this this this btw this one glows in the dark!
Could you possibly make a two tiered table with your test pieces
I have decided to buy cheep tables and make this diy for our next bedroom reno
DJ Chaos Katelyn pouring as she pleases
Can someone translate the French at starting 16:09?
How is Katelyn soo cute? OMG!!
I really loved the streaked glow in the dark look
My rapper names for you guys would be Kaos n Chil, although in this particular video I'm not sure which is which 😜
Great job, They came out really nice . Stay safe
Rapper kitty (based off dj one)
That ending mind fked me harder than the Matrix. ARE THE WINDOWS REAL?!?! ARE WE REAL?!?!?  0_o
tonight in the booth we got crackalackin katelyn and edgy evan  dropping some sick beats 😎😎😎
A matching headboard would look 👍🏽
"future-proof"  nope. every resin yellows over time. within 3 years, you're gonna have a nasty yellowed tabletop and no way to reverse it. You probably would have been better off just using a cloth covering.
I hear "glow in the dark" bedroom furniture and auto "nope". not my aesthetic at all. i can't have any lights or glow stuff in my room while I sleep. drives me crazy.
I think you guys should be a rap duo called Rezz 'n' Tyme. The question then becomes who will be Razz and who will be Tyme 🤔🤔🤔
I loved this video! it really RESINated with me 😆
16:09  TRANSLATION (idk I was curious to know what it said) This proves it This first one, my love Here, my love The first one I did, That’s all Google Translate, sorry French people That was Make love to me on the rooftops of Paris! They were both tube dips, my love Dang it!  (FYI, I do NOT speak French, I just translated these words back into English using google translate, so all this could be completely wrong. If you speak French, please correct me! Ty❤️)
I wonder if Kaitlyns use of the heat gun was the reason hers didn't do that cell thing
Next project: making EPIC wall art to spruce up the bedroom 🥰
Unrelated to the video, but you should make silk scarfs using the ebru painting technique!
I don’t know if this was on purpose but I noticed that the clear protective layer of plastic is still on your resin masks, I think that if you took it off we could see your faces better on camera!!
9:55 ....WHAT HAVE YOU MADE!....she doesn't seem to like it. in fact its ugly!
This turned out so amazing! Wish I could do resin projects!
All of the windows are a lie! Evan and Katelyn clearly actually live in an underground bunker with no windows from which they will take over the world as commanded by the Supurrvisor!
Lil Resinator and Big Chaos bringing to you their newest hit Toebean Purrito featuring rap artist of the year, Supervisor 3000.
i feel like they won't stop until the entire world is coated in resin....
Katelyn's rapper name could be pawzy
You two are adorable, your videos give me such joy.  But the French subtitles here gave me the best bellylaughs I've had in a long while.  Parfait! ~chef's kiss~
Oh my God these tables are so cool, I'm so jealous. They give me glacier vibes to be honest
DJ Kitty K. mixin' (resin) in da house.
So hear me out: is it possible that evans looked like he used alkohol-ink and katelyns didn’t because evan put acrylic paint underneath?? Or did I miss something?
Every 👏 video 👏 they 👏 come 👏 closer 👏 to 👏 being 👏 that 👏 kind 👏 of 👏 channel
Katelyn is better at being evan than evan, katelyn.
16:30 i think it was the heat gun thing
You guys are so cute, thank you for your videos <3 Also I am rewatching the office, if you know what I mean 🤣
Wedding presint kek
Even better Rapper name "Lil' Toe Bean$". The dollar symbol makes it gangsta. 😋
Rapper name, Lil' Toe Beans!
Hats off to the editors! They are truly talented. Makes the videos a joy to watch!! 🌟
Am I the only one that thought setting up proper lighting and equipment with the sole purpose of filming Joob chilling on the bed would have also made complete sense?
Haha I love "ow ow ow ow resin time"
You Should Do A Video On your new filming and Streaming setup
That intro was 🙃
them table tops look super cool
This video was so awesome, definitely my favorite in a while, just the pure energy was immaculate.  Rapper name suggestions: Big K and Lil' E with a side performance from the JoobDood
even wow gets me laughing hahaha
Lil Small Paws and Biggie Tall Claws. Rapper Names for Y’all.
yall should make a side table with a built in wireless charger!
Rapper name for Katelyn could be lil Lyn
Evan and Katelyn: Slaps the bed, getting super excited, loud voices Kitty: "Don't look you'll just encourage them"
I really love the way your results turned out and that they glow. The yellowness of the glow powder actually adds to it because most White marble has varying degrees of yellowness in it. The only thing that stops IT from looking like a real marble is the fact that the sides don't match the top. If you had taken the tops off the stands made a frame around it and poured it so that the marble went over the sides of the edge you could probably be more realistic looking.
Those are frigging beautiful!!! Like...I'd buy that. So gorgeous!!
Wow, I'm so impressed with how this turned out. Definitely one of your best resin projects. Past experience paying off.
Kaitlin can be "short slice"  rapper name!
I was thinking Katelyn's rapper name is Positive K, but that's already taken ;-) The Resinhill Gang is nice for you both!
The resin time song with the "ow"s made me laugh out loud! :D
The test pieces, while glowing, immediately reminded me of 1990s school photo backgrounds.
Dj Double Gloves and MC Misplaced Screws in da haus with the Dirty Pour Gang
its not a restoration if you dont put it back in its original state, this is a refurbishing/makeover. I loved the video though haha, i would love to see you do an actual researched restoration of furniture!
I DESPERATLY want to see katelyns “ow” in the O’Riely auto parts theme. PLEASE.
I came to these comments for those rapper names. Internet, provide!
Yall need to watch StoneCoat Countertops YouTube videos
This is probably one of my favorite episodes yet!!
Lil,paws is a good rapper name
DJ pour would be a cool DJ name
Yikes.
Katelyn rapper name: $KeoW-Dog$ (key-ow-dog)------------Katelyn+mEOW+DOG    enjoy :)
What amazing translation skills you have, editor Katelyn😂

5:38
Can only take the 8 yr old princess attitude for so long. Too much, guys.
0:02 “it’s for our Patreon exclusive content Katelyn!! With the new tiers we’ll be able to retire at 40!
rapper name:   CC Paws,   (cool cat paws)
That music change when Evan went off the rails with that test pour was perfect.
How is there no art and no headboard in your bedroom
23:29 Am I the only one seeing something phallic shaped? Not that it a bad thing, just being observant. 🙈🍆
"Are any of our windows real? Who knows!" E&K had enough from the pandemic and secretly moved into a survival bunker deep underground. Their back yard was clearly a green screen. :D Those night stands look amazing! That glow powder looks surprisingly bright! Does the camera catch more of the light or does it actually look like this IRL?
Was Evan's test because of the paint underlayer? Maybe it wasn't dry enough?
So would the Goddess of Resin be Joob?
What about injecting black or gray under the white using a syringe and needle?  I think that might add a bit of depth with a greater amount of control over where the color is placed.  However, I don't know anything about pouring resin.
It's totally fine if ya'll wanna have screws on the counter, we won't judge. Just make sure Joob doesn't jump onto anything pointy (my cats are chaos magnets--must be why they like me)
As someone with adhd, I must say me and Evan have a lot in common lol.
@27:22 Katelyn does an impression of herself.  ...  Okay.
Exactly what I'm doing to my living room end tables (except for the glow!) They turned out perfect you guys!
Hear me out: black light night lamps
Katelyn rapper name smitten kitten Evan rapper name chaos cat so smitten kitten and the chaos cat
It would be so cool to see you guys try a challenge video where Evan does simple and cautious and Katelyn unleashes her inner chaos 👀🥰 *chaos chaos chaos chaos*
They turned out beautiful!
I kind of wanted to see them in the dark for longer, to try and tell if they would make it more difficult to fall asleep or something
Katelyn's trapper name gotta be Lil'Lyn
Guys that’s amazing! They look so good. I reckon that chamfering the edges just a few millimetres would make it look even more stone like…
Lil kitty and big kitty (lil kitty is kaytlyn and big kitty for Evan and you’re Duo name is chaos cats)
Katelyn's Rapper name: Chaotic K.
E&K: WeRe NoT tHaT kINd oF cHaNnEl This intro:
Katelyn looks amazing in pigtails!
lol they don't even think about how bad RESIN is for the environment but wasting gloves matter...
This was amazing!!!!!!
The fact that I've never done resin and think I could accomplish this is laughable. Maybe I'll start with a tiny marble tray before I attack my nightstands
"But mine looks good 😅" Evan sounded like my husband. The cruel reality of being married is they become real honest regardless of your feelings 😭
is this the longest Jub has been on screen?
Rapper name, Kate-Kat breakin' off a piece of dat beat.
Katelyn also used the heat gun on her first layer... so evans probably turned out bad because the bubbles rose and popped, muddling the colors
Even saying he's off the rails as the camera cuts to reveal his plushie... fallen over
I love the Dj Soft Paws name, I was thinking for Katelyn's rapper name it should be Toe Beanz lol.
WOW! 🤩 I love it matte!
Lil paws
I like to think I am chaos evan while crafting but I think I am more Katelyn
Lil Katelyn and big boi E spinning some tunez on em decks.
28:23 Evan: I think I'm gonna like, play it safe.            Me: Nooo! YoU WeRe THe cHoSEn OnE! 28:41 Evan: Oops...            Katelyn: Nooo!
Those side tables looked great. How about adding wireless charger under the resin so you can charge your phone overnight without plugging it in?
rapper name submissions... King Chaos and Slides Queen
DJ Name Ideas:  DJ Resinater, or The Resinaters, DJ Big K and DJ Chaos, Team EEKK! (Like the sound)
You should make a resin bedhead next! A complete set.
Nice PAPRs.  How do you deal with sound?
The google translated part was almost completely right.
The choice to make it Matte!! Chefs kiss!!
But are the supurrvisor approved?
“Sometimes there’s grids” Imagine not found 🤣
If you aren't aiming for a relationship like these two's out of your life are you even real, i don't believe you
o my ¡¡¡ that was amazing
"I think that having a matte surface will make it look more stone like" Evan says about marble, the stone most often seen presented glossy
was the resin reacting to the paint under the first poor?
My bf sent me this video and asked me to specifically pay attention to the first few seconds cause Katelyn's "he he he we make joke" sounds like me hahaha we love you guys!
I put so much effort into making my bedroom a nice dark place to sleep, I cannot imagine anything worse than a glow-in-the-dark bedside table.  Fun video though. Er, each to their own I guess :)
The French part was so funny haha
I am madly in love with the supurrvisor. SO FLOOF!
Have you seen the stone coat epoxy channel? They have some pretty cool techniques with ways to add spray paints and other things to make stone effects.
I think the slight yellow tint makes it look more realistic
PLEASE remove the protective plastic from the fronts of your masks!
The French from Google translate made me laugh so hard 🤣 as a Canadian I salute
This is so cool, I wanna do it now too LoL
The Bob Ross hair!🤣🤣🤣
It's ok for the French. Despite the jokes, it was Actually ok. (Signed, a French baguette)
"Make me love on the roofs of Paris" 🤣🤣
You're so good
youre supposed to fold the fajitas guys..XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I want that mirror in the bedroom!
I know this is not the point of the video but... what's the fae window?? I have a super dark studio and been wanting something like that!!
16:20 This makes me so happy I speak French! Lol..
Dangerous project: rainbow marble resin pour
Wonderful work, Lil' Cat Scratch and Big Beard Boi! Those are my rapper name submissions.
no cause their relationship is so cute
I missed these working with furniture videos
Kitty Katelyn
You both have me laughing through the entire video 😂😂❤️
My guess for why Evan’s tester Marble turned out weird for the first pore is the paint he put underneath the resin. I am saying Thais because for the pore second time it didn’t turn out weird and I don’t Believe it is because of the ink because I’m pretty sure they have used the ink before and it didn’t turn out bubbly. I believe that it might be caused by the paint underneath and maybe the paint hasn’t dried properly or maybe there was something in the paint that cost the resin react like this, seeing as the big strip also has bubbles. ( sorry for any  mistakes I am not very good at English)
Y'all this is one of the best ones you've ever done! I GASPED when you showed the matte vs super glossy finishes. SO SATISFYING
Ok. Gentle glow top is a great idea, but i think im just gonna spray a whole layer of classic green glow in the dark now.
I'm still at the beginning of this video, and I already worry about the glow in the dark long term. I need total darkness, the glow would dive me crazy!
WoW! that was super fun to watch. And it turned out AMAZING! great job!!! I got scared when I saw Evan's first pour full of bubbles, but then you fix it, and it felt sooooo good! Katelyn's work kept going better and better. You guys are SO much fun to watch! Thanks for all the content you create!
Resin time the remix!
What is this world where Katelyn is embraced chaos and Evan is precise.
36:23 whatss this music from? the anime ish music
That looks so good. It turned out absolutely beautiful. Also loved the choas Katelyn vibes in this video xD
I thoroughly enjoyed this 😂😂😂
Katler the rapper
How do you recycle all this stuff or do you keep everything?
I got an idea! Rainbow geode, extra glitter!
theyre slowly turning into that type of channel
These turned out stunning! I love the matt and I love the subtle translucency!!
rapper names: lil Res and K-os
THIS IS REAAAALLY COOOL ✨✨✨
Evan: sets up camera in the bedroom Katelyn: not that kind of channel
"GET INTO THOSE GROOVES"
If it is reverse day katelyn has to be as tall as evan and Evan has to be as short as katelyn lol. Also EvanAndKateyln pls see this it is cool,     I got a squishmallow and I named it Joob!!!!! It reminds me of Joob
I can't believe you didn't ask for the suprrvisor's approval
Today Katelyn chose violence 😂
One of minecraft landscape builders recently got a real geologist to rate his mountain builds. Maybe you can get some geologist too and see if they get fooled by this rock imitation.
That french was awesome thanks xD
Me: one short video and lets go to study Also me: oh, an Evan and Katelyn 40 min video, lets do it!!
These look honestly so good!
5:06 i bet 30,000 people just checked their internet connection
Loved the French subtitles, There's a lot of pigeons on the roofs tho...
The supervisor looked annoyed.
great job guys.
the (word)crafters Catchy Kat and Dirty pour Evan in da house
Katelyn you are so cute and fun, i am totaly mad about you....
*JOOBII!* <3
Rapper name: Lil Paw
Your rapper names should be   “Rez” and “Zin”
It was great. So impressed. So matte.
Ah, super video! I really, really loved the unexpected role reversal in the testing. It's fun to see ya'll get excited every time, and I think you did such a good job on this marble. Can't wait for more! With the new house, I'm sure ya'll have a million ideas of things to decorate with. Do you like the sims? Maybe you could do something like the series with trying to replicate items online, but something from the sims. They have a bunch of purely decorative stuff, and they're pretty silly <3 Either way, much love and can't wait for the next one.
katelyn being excited is good content
Katelyn is giving me massive hair envy in this vid my gosh!
I like that Evan is just casually flipping us off at 12:06 lol
The editing in this video was everything 😂😂👌🏽
Great. job!! They came out looking great, I love the glow effect I would have been very curious to see the teal  in the dirty pour too
13:30 oh god the royalty free music is bringing me creepypasta YouTube read flashbacks
idk if evan likes dogs but woofser and meowser
Surprisingly, no mistakes in the Google translate French, I'm impressed
That sanding was so painful to hear ew hahaha I'm excited to see the final reveal
I wonder what people thousands of years in the future will think of Evan and Katelyn’s indestructible resin projects
DJ Cateye Cutie
Yall need to stop hinting and teasing and just drop that only fans
Evan is Chaos Boy, he cannot help it 🤣🤣🤣
As a French person, I felt very seen, thank you for that moment E&K hahaha
This was stunning!! I wonder how long the glow lasts for in the night???
I have to say, the glow makes it look vaguely like an aurora borealis! It looks super cool!
Now the fronts of the cabin´s don´t match with the desk. Just saying *evil grin* ;)
Off topic, but I too had an emergency appendectomy then got covid the minute I recovered… Glad y’all are feeling better and made it through
As a french, I've laugh so hard, thank you !!
Katelyns DJ name so should have been the OCDJ x
Now we need a glow in the dark resin lampshade that loosely looks like marble or granite
« Fais moi l’amour sur les toits de Paris » 🤣😂
We got a lot of Zen Evan in this video
Someone is pregnant 😁😁😁
Katelyn, as a fellow Katelyn, I love you 😂 I’m 3 minutes into the video and can totally relate 🤣
Katelyn's rap name: Lil Paw Evan's rap name: Big Paw
Hey gang, I just wanna say, the edit on this was *chef kiss*
Those look absolutely beautiful!
Can someone translate the French for me if it even is French cuz I have no idea
Honestly, you guys are both adorkable and hilarious! 😂  The end result of your project turned out fabulous, very classy but fun too. 👍 Only concern I have is that you didn't put a matte clear coat on them and that will make keeping them clean very difficult.  ...I did feel almost like I was watching Freaky Friday though, since the roles were reversed for this project, with Evan being mostly careful and precise and Katelyn being spontaneous and chaotic. 😅
Great job DJ Soft Pawz and King Chaos!🐱 🤴  (I love how in this scenario, Evan is the rapper. Lol looking forward to your first single, "Words are Hard.")
I love this! Next up: Matching resin marble headboard?!
Love your relationship. My partner introduced me to your channel, I got him your merch for his birthday, then he proposed in his Joob in space shirt 🥰
Who saw the eyeball in the resin at 7:33?
"Lil resin drip" the rapper
That intro got me scared.... 👁️👅👁️
I like Katelyn test marble better
Why dont we call you...Resin. K😂
I'm laughing because the French subs were nothing to with wot evan ws saying! 🤣🤣
I thought my speakers were going bad until I realized you two were wearing the safety masks.
hello fresh is anti union
Wait, the windows are fake?  What's real anymore
That turned out so good!!!
Snoop-joob would be an awesome rapper name for Katelyn. Love your videos. Love from South Africa 🌍. Please tag me. 🙏☺️😂
Best video yet. :)
I too, am proud of yalll! much class
Okay but these are incredible and now I actually need to learn how to resin so I can make glow in the dark marble :o
Should of put a wireless charging pad on the top
How long into the night does the glow last?
Kibble N' Bits...Katelyn is Bits...haha
Lolll your space helmets 😂
WOW  !!!!!!!!!!!!!   Spectacular Glowing Nightstands !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So good to see you guys back, hope you're feeling much better. I want to Matt Marble finish all the surfaces in my house now😂🥰
Google translate did a bad bad job if it thought resin pour is making love on rooftops in Paris. Hilarious editing lol
You guys should try 3D painting on resin! Like when people paint koi fish layer by layer and the end result looks 3D!
I had hello fresh a few weeks ago to test out. It's sooooo much packaging, that's crazy. No only paper but also plastic. What a waste and environmental destruction. 🤦🏻
KATELYN AKA DJ SOFT PAWS AKA LIL PAWS, I REST MY CASE
Hey that turned out awesome!
That's cool!
you guys did such an amazing job!!!! obsessed with this end result
Your vein looks fat..."That's what she said"...lol
wow, these turned out amazing!!! I love the final result, they look so beautiful! and the glow was so much better than I was thinking it'd be, I didn't think it would glow that well. Love this!
I'll be curious to see how the matte finish holds up. I've seen a few videos where people have sanded down their resin surfaces for a matte finish but just made it very susceptible to staining. Which probably won't be as big of a problem for bedside tables, but sometimes life happens! You never know!
Ok but the fakt window ... My life is a lie
While I absolutely love the classy project (will definitely watch more of these), I did read the title expecting a table top made out of resin and glass marbles. And now I have questions without answers.
They turned out so well and like oh snap to the E & K brain swap energy. Chaos Katelyn is a vibe
👉👈
Sandpaper is such a bad sensory feeling/sound for me I was biting my lip and getting goosebumps all over during that bit 😖
Looks great... but.. the front of the side tables seem to have stone rectangles that are marble like but with a brownish color... did you think of using brown streaks in the top resin marble?
Literally the only channel that I'll watch AND pay attention to the ad read  Just cuz y'all are amazing and funny
Katelyn the raping cat and Evan her side cat raper (Sorry I had to)
The opposite of chaos Evan is obviously Controlled Evan!!
im mad that the fake window is what blew my mind today
Cat-lyn for a rapper name 😂
He really jinxed himself lmao Katelyn's Evan pour turned into a Katelyn pour. And Evan's Katelyn pour turned into an Evan pour 😅😅😅😅
I love how they came out! Good job.
Katelyn with pigtails is iconic
Chaos and control? That sounds familiar 🤔
I'm excited to see where you're going to go with this just barely in frame technique
Also why not place wireless charging pad in the resin to charge your phone at sleepy times
So proud of you guys for creating something, classy, yet practical! Love the glow in the dark feature! Too bad a layer didn't have stars in it so when it glowed you saw stars!
this one was SO COOL!!! I kinda want one of this hahahaha this one is one of my favorite projects ever! thanks for doing this.
French translation... HILARIOUS!!!
No supurrvisor!?
Rapper name Lil Tabby X
The paw and claw (rapper names)
23:28 - or an x-ray of an alien 😜 seriously, though, LOVE the finished tops!
You guys were eating those tacos like they’re were tostadas. Fold them in half they taste better trust me I’m Mexican
16:08  Cela le prouve Ce premier, mon amour Ici, mon amour  Le premier que j'ai fait c'est tout google translate, désolé les français  que c'ètait fais moi l'amour sur les toits de paris!  ils étaient tous les deus des dips en tube, mon amour Sacre bleu!  Translation   This proves it This first, my love Here my love The first one I made that's all google translate, sorry french people that was make love to me on the rooftops of paris! they were both tube dips, my love Damn it!    Your welcome haha
idk if y'all knew about the issues with Hello Fresh and their attempts to squash their worker's advocating for better working conditions. not accusing y'all of supporting that just a heads up since i know its not big news!! loving the vid so far, you guy's content is so good, me and my partner love watching it
Wouldn't it have been better to make 2 resin slabs to sit on top of the night stands? I have glass slabs on top of our nightstands. Then you can touch up the edges with a white paint marker before putting the resin slab on top.
Best video ever!!!!
This whole thing has made me realize how much I need to brush up on my french
Your rapper name should be kat-n-space short for Katelyn in space and also cat in space both in one
Evan the chaos deamon: "It's future proof!" Cat makes trill. Supurrvisor says "Challenge accepted!"
Honestly my partner has been asking me if I can do this…..now I can! Thank you for a great how to!!!
You should pick the rapper name that…. Resin-ates with your the most. <— ha ha. 😂👏🏻
Great job guys 👏👏 love your video' s keep on going
The cool John Mayerish guitar riffs put this video over the TOP!
It turned out beautiful! Is there a headboard project in the future??
These turned out very nice, but I wonder if they put some more warm toned veins or browner toned accents if it would have tied in better with the veins in the wood. They still look beautiful regardless!!
Yooooo this seriously looked amazing, and the glow was shockingly bright!! also the sudden flip from very convincing daylight lighting to revealing it's actually night blew my mind omg
I would be so annoyed by any light shining at night
I love how these videos are long, is that weird?😃
K: “some cringy couple !” E: “*gasp in horror* I thought they were cute.”  K: “🥺😏 they were alright”
That's seriously nice!
Those sparkles noises are so cruel when Pokemon Legend Arceus just came out and I kept questioning if I heard a shiny spawn.
Soon your house will turn into resin
As a French Canadian I want to see lots more French subtitles!
Maybe you should make a project out of all of your shame gloves 🧤🗑
I'm actually in the process of re-doing the top of my own bedside table with a resin top. Except I'm going galaxy rather than marble lol.
Omg I never thought we would have Kayoss Katelyn and gloting Kayelyn in same show I fill bad your test dident tern out and how she hat to rubb it in... such a bad sport today Katelyn...glad you started taking Evan's lead and started behaving
Okay but Katelyn and Evan literally switched energy today. We had chaos Katelyn and reserved Evan and no one was prepared for it. Awesome work guys!! :0
It looks like labradorite when in glow mode!!
ow ow ow ow resin time, love it!
Joob is front and center this early in the video?! My day has been made!
27:29 I love Katelyn’s passive aggressiveness 😂😂😂
I love the stickers you stuck on your resin mask thing
You should make planet pool balls or something like that
Lil’ Goofy and Katie B of the Heavy Hitter Heat Gun crew
@33:14   the price you pay to make your "nightstands" glow  ayo katelyn  SUS
K: I’m worried about messing these up E: how many resin projects have we done? K: How many have we messed up? E: 😶
Rapper names!! Evan: Machine Shop Chaos Katelyn: Chee-toe Beans
man i feel like third wheeling here, even though they are married. lol
This is one of the best projects I've watched you do. 👏
Rapper name - Resin Time!
This channel needs to be renamed... Resin and Katelyn!  It has become the resin channel. lol! I make a jokeee!!!
_Resin, y'all!_
They turned out super cool!
rapper duo name: Level X & Mold Real-ez
Lil paws and EVN
A suggestion(?):  I know it's not time efficient but, does pouring a thin streak of resin on fully cured resin help it retain the shape instead of spreading out? If so, it would have maybe helped to pour glow in the dark resin in thin streaks and let it cure (on top of cured resin) and then pour a thin top layer of translucent white to even out the surface.  My biggest question is if pouring thin streaks of resin on cured resin helps with control if you let the thin streaks cure by themselves instead of adding it together as the top layer.
Wow it ended up so beautiful! Good job guys Y’all are making me wanna start playing with resin but that’s one expensive hobby 😅
:3
I've seen people do this for countertops but painted the marbling first then covered in apoxy and it still looked like marble
Dj Cat-led (like dj khaled) and Evanem (like eminem)
Lol! “DJ Soft Paws” 🐾 🐈‍⬛ 🎶 💻⏯🔊🎤🎧
Soggy bread 🤦‍♀️
No offence to Total Boat, but this pretty much is what Stone Coat does. I'm sure that Total probably has an equivalent Viscosity/cure time product so just getting some techniques and inspiration from there channel would work. I don't think they've ever done glow, that turned out kind of cool. Also, the round over and slight matt finish works nice.
this ad in the video might be the ad that I wanted to watch the least but ended up loving the most. the expressions that katelyn made!! the even but buff hahahahah omg you guys are hilarious!
MewMew K and E-Zoomies  :D
Evan and katelyn na thats mr resin and miss makin weereerreeerre waaaahhhhherrrr
The switching of the roles in the test pour phase oh my gosh 😂 Chaos Katelyn and Controlled Evan, what is this madness!!  They turned out so good though! I am shook by how much they look like real marble! And the glow is just *chefs kiss*
I personally feel like it was a balsy move to pour directly on top of the table instead of making an additional table top to adhere to it
Looks great i only wish the grey were brownier to match the front  drawer detail.
I love the commentary between you two 😂
Please collaborate with Saf and Tyler
This is going on my bucket list lol
I wish i could be you guys' friend because y'all are so fun.
I need pitch black to be able to fall asleep, glow in the dark furniture sounds awful for me😅 I literally tape over the indicator lights on my humidifier because that's too much light lol
They “never go too fancy”, what y’all talking about? I think that the velvet keyboard is ✨majestic✨ and I need one to up the classy-ness of my room
STUNNING
Katelyn's Rapper name should be Feline Fyne
looks like its time for a resin/wood custom headboard!!!!
39:13
i feel like the tests could’ve been so different because katelyn used a heat gun and evan didn’t
These looked so good!!
Looks amazing.
Duo DJ names, soft paws and sharp claws Duo raper names, res-mess and the cure-rater; like curing resin
Love your videos every time!
Ok I lost it at the French subtitles XD
Is that not gonna be a distraction in the night while your trying to sleep the glow
Wait, am I real?
Anyone wanna translate the explanation bit 🤣
These are STUNNING!!!!!
The glowing got my mind wandering about other light possibilities... I wonder if it would work to pour resin around fiber optics to make little point lights just under the surface, all illuminated by a small LED strip hidden under the table (at the other end of the fibers) 🤔
As a french student...  you tried :D
Rap group name: Resin Adjacent  Individual names:  K-Kat and Mr. Chaos.
Sacre bleu!!!
DJ Kat Ellen! 🐈‍⬛
If you add a little lavender to it, would it offset the yellow ?
katelyn's rapper name should be Lil Toe Beans 🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛😺😺
You are guys are just the cutest. I’ve been having a rough past few months and your videos always bring me joy! So much love to you both ❤️
I feel like the reason Katelyn's initial layer pour ended up better is because of how she poured it. She started with the corners, which pushed and held every other pour towards the center. Evan's being the opposite, pushed the resin in a bunch of different directions. Even when Evan isn't chaotic, it ends up chaotic. 😆
I love this, but those would probably keep me awake. Lol
The edit was go good on this video.
You know it's a good video when it starts off with a dirty joke😂😭
Chaotic Katelyn is my fav
Evan: Making fun of Katelyn for her side table also being damaged. Katelyn: "Stop right there bucko"
Rapper names “E&k with the aluminum tape” “DJ adjacent with Evan and Katlyn” “The witty kitty’s” “DJ Catlyn”
At 23:00 my eardrum was blown out 😵‍💫 I was holding my phone really close to my ear to hear the flashlight noise lmao
Ok I actually gasped at 2500 grit sandpaper along with Katelyn 😂
the hello fresh ad they did really makes me see them do resin dipped or coated foods like sandw ich or other food sort of like resin food sculptures.
These turned out so cool!!!
Golden soft paws
High, we’re Evan and Katelyn, and today, we are going to be making p**n.
Katelyn's editing is getting better and better and if it's not her chefs kiss. Also I would love to see them do a head and foot bored that matches
Ohhhh man, those mini tester things look so neat!! I like the finished product, but the testers just make me kinda want to hang them up on the wall or use them as ginormous drink coasters, lol.
Super fun vid ♥️
Love the Resin Time Remix
My hubby and I have had the same bed sides/bed side table change issue so I’m excited to see you guys come up with this solution! Plus I love your jokes 🥰😂  Oh and Katelyn’s rapper name- Klean Layas
I watch you guys for a few years now and I am so glad to see every journey you guys go through! Much love from Brazil!
Rapper Katie Lyin in the HOUSE 🏡

My family is on vacation this week and my mom had some hello fresh recipes delivered to our air-b&b, they where super good and ment we didn’t have to eat out a lot but also didn’t have to get a bunch of groceries! 10/10 would recommend! I love your videos, just found y’all a few weeks ago from the fuzzy keyboard video, and I watched a bunch of your videos! 😂✌️❤️

yo Katelyn's rapper name should be calico claws
I want to paint your bedroom wall, it needs a mural or smth it's so big and blank! 🤠✨
Watching this vid has actually given me the confidence I need to finally do a resin topcoat on the kitchen island that I painted to look like granite. It's got several layers of polycrylic, but it needs that glossy layer to really sell the look. Next up, redoing the top of my desk with resin and holographic/iridescent glitter...
The black on Evans could have been a silicone type lubricant on the rubber tip of the plunger in the syringe. The second heavy application drip / stream from the stick went higher up in the syringe.
Lil Bean
Istg meal kit sponsor is the best kind of sponsor. I'd rather watch people cook food for 1-2 mins than friggin game ad for 45 seconds.
Classy glow in the dark is an oxymoron
Safiya and tyler wanna collab!!! They mentioned in their livestream
I know that window looked familiar
15:34 hahaha so funny
pls make resin bread
"this really cringy couple" and when they're insulting themselves they are sooo funny i love these ppl
Polished granite is very shiny, just like polished marble.
... But did they level it? Joking aside those look amazing!
The edits (/written jokes) were on pooooint 👏👍💝
I’ve been waiting 3 weeks for this vid😭
Oh NO OUR PANT ITS BROKEN!
Rapper name: L'il Resin Pour
Ok so normally I skip/fast forward through ads. But y’all make me watch your ads for the creativity y’all put into the ad segments. Your sponsors should be very happy.
The french killed me ahhhhhh.
whatcha doin there intro.. ha ha *nervous laugh*
rapper duo name: soft words      istead of words are hard lol
Alternative title : How to make your lampshades redundant.
What is the opposite of chaos Evan? Its Katelyn. There was never a second thought in my mind and I answered 2 seconds before Katelyn answered 😂
The marble is fake. The window is fake. Nothing is real!
"not that kind of channel" mhm sure keep telling yourselves that /lh  love you guys
I wonder if you can add glow stars to resin? Like the kind for the ceiling?
Wow! Those look great! Nice work! It looks like your hands and phones are floating when you touch the glow. Super cool.
Uh guys did youmleave the protective film on your helmets ? Pretty sure I saw a peel tab
... wait... Am I real?! ARE ANY OF US REAL?!!
High key Hello fresh saves me everything I work 12 hour shifts so it's genuinely got some great recipes and having all the ingredients preportioned out is perfect for my lifestyle it keeps me from picking the easy fast food route all the time
Well, new hobby unlocked
Are we sure windows actually exist?
Rapper name : Lil Kat
I Love Kaitlyn's poney tails! So cute! I feel like this the most, like, _sofisticated_ , I think, project you guys have ever done, and it turned out amazing!!! I love the glow!!! And the matte!! Everything!!!
the editing is phenomenal, i don’t even wanna ask how long it took  edit: good job gaming editors!
😀
I saw more fake windows in the thumbnail of the next recommended video. You’ve given me trust issues centered around windows! 🤣 Looooved the Bob Ross overlay on Evan. The edits are so good!!!
evans first pour looked amazing
For real, you need to collaborate with Artist Till Death. They do daily resin art here on YouTube.
J'ai absolument adoré les sous-titres français. 😗👌
You guys need to try the glow pigments from Culture hustle
I feel like you're going to really regret the glow at some point.
That looks freaking awesome guys good job I might just have to do that with my side table, it’s seen better days lol
experimental lady sounds like a band name
Katelyn “ we found this Cringy couple” Evan “ I thought they were cute”  Me : wait hold on *skips back oh wait they are talking about themselves
I always love the touch of "what's the worst that could happen" experimentation Evan and Katelyn bring to all their projects, it makes it seem that more more approachable for us aspiring mad scientists.
don't pretend that the matt finish isn't so u don't see scratches as much
once upon a time I was gonna say something mean about ur side tables but I'm so glad I didn't know I know they were a wedding present and not some cheap flatpack from Wallmart
okay but the window thing really threw me for a loop lol
I relate to Evan, I’m always getting perfectly nice furniture scuffed up! Off to see how it turns out
Okay that fake window reveal threw me off so bad.
Wow the side tables look soooo good! Good job 👏🏼 And I was genuinely surprised to see all the lights (even the window!!) were fake 😂 Thank you for sharing that haha You guys are awesome
Katelyn's rap name: lil' toe beans

A headboard! You shud make a really cool headboard! 🙆🏼‍♀️💕💕💕

Ah yes French, totally accurate, nothing weird at all. Nope not at all
Rapper name: little king Kay. Don’t know if that’s already taken.
Jokes on us they even don’t have windows
I really love how in this video Katelyn seems to be the chaotic force and Evan is the one to balance it out! It's a relaly cool change!
evans voice at 24:40 is so smooth and deep! I love it
MAKE RESIN SWORDS YOU COULD DO CHRYSTAL SWORDS YOU COULD DO GLITTER SWORDS YOU COULD DO CLEAR SWORDS!?!?!!?
I suggest Kit & Kat for the rapper names just for the humor in it. 😹
I’ve noticed you never print photos for reference to have in front of you while doing these. It would probably make it easier to see photos of marble while trying to make it
28:02 OMG LOL- I LITERALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS A WISHBONE TOO! You two are such a cute couple and are so funny! Please, keep up the great work you two! Your videos always brighten my depressing day.
You guys should do a house pour befor you move out again haha
Y'all need a big work of art over the bed. New video idea 🤔
Those turned out really good :)
love how these turned out!!
Suggested rapper name: resin rapper
The one window we know is real is joob’s catio window.

Katelyn immediately throwing Evan under the bus 😂
wow, those really turned out incredibly awesome, and it was super fun to watch the process!  i loooove the longer videos.  thanks, E&K!!
Omg the ouch sound in the resin time got me laughing so hard 😂😂
i"m french, and i cried
So they're making FED tables?
the intro of this video: oh noo! our table! Its broken!
I took woodworking my first year of high school (this year) because of you guys videos! I have enjoyed it and you make it seem as fun as it is! Much love 💕 also missed Katelyn’s do do do do for resin time haha
Looking at your bedroom, I hope ypu guys can make somw kind of cool headboard like maybe with lights you can turn on amd off or some cool element. Something that matches your tables because they look so good,  and a headboard would reaply help complete your bedroom look.
Did anyone else notice the music at 22:00 was the backing music in geometry dash?😅
Katelyn you're Chinese?
Evan's so proud of the wear and tear he put on that nightstand XD I mean, you know he used it!
Omggggg DJ Katelyn 😂🤣😂🤣
Excellent job on those results!  Especially the glowing.
French google translate is funny
It's literally freaky Friday 🤣 y'all switched personalities for this project
This has to be one of my favorite projects you've ever done. Turned out amazing! Also you need some art on your bedroom walls haha!  Love you guys! Keep up the great content! 😁🇦🇺
26:57 that buff katelyn really made me laugh.
Lil Kate as the rapper name
The real question is: can I tell Hello Fresh I'm allergic to things? Will they gimme recipes I will like without ingredients I'm "allergic to"?
I Totally Loved This Project. The Tables Look AMAZING !!! I Have An OBSESSION With Anything That Glows-In-The-Dark !!!!
I have a hard time understanding socal cues, what was the joke in the very beginning?

That's pretty sick actually
The most mindblowing thing about this video was the fake windows tbh Gonna have an existential crisis

Katleyn is scissors evan is paper and you're cat is ROCK
39:00 That satisfaction when you absorb a sneeze.
You two need to make a headboard for your bed next!
Super cute! Have you seen Stone Coat Countertop's channel? I'm kind of addicted to their stuff and they do projects like this ALL the time and have tons of tips that make the process easier. And they even show the "recipe" they use to get the different effects along with the techniques for whatever stone you're trying to replicate. Would be worth looking into. :)
how is the editing so freaking funny in your videos i'm CACKLING
Omg this is the best marble diy I have seen I love it.
You doing okay Evan? Katelyn, is Evan okay? You look a bit like you may have had an allergic reaction under your eyes. Just concerned. Hope you're okay.
If you want less reflections so you can see through the mask and just reflective surfaces in general for like $15 you can use a CPL filter that goes on front of the camera. Basically removes reflections so you can see through them or makes them stand out and hard to see through. (You can turn the filter while it’s on the lens to change the reflection tolerance)
Imagine a matching headboard! 😍
Dudes! They look so good!
"we found this cringey couple" got me hahahaha
3:57 "Oh no... Our paint... It's broken"
Those came out awesome!
Did Evans voice change just a wee bit towards the end or am I trippin? Lol. Love this idea, really wanna try it. It turned out absolutely beautiful!
O-m-g ._. amazing
You have a fancy house, you can afford a nice headboard. Treat yo self!
I see Evan being that guy wearing the super duper face mask space helmet to walmart during the pandemic.  Love it.
8:15 .•♫•♬•same same but different•♬•♫•. Sorry crazy kpop fan here
Why are you setting up a camera in our bedroom  It's not that kind of channel
katelyn rapper name could be Resin Paws 😎 with the emoji
All I can think about after the intro, is a resin headboard?! I feel like, if there is any two people that can do it right, it's gotta be Evan and Katelyn!
These turned out SO GOOD!! I love the glow, and I can just imagine how nice they feel with the buffed resin. Great job guys!!
These videos make me want to get out and craft things, but I'm scared to use resin. So I live vicariously through your videos and I really thought evan was gonna say oh no our paint it's broken 😔 🤣
Classy by day, cheesy by night, i love it jdjdj
Wait, you just switched sides of the bed? Is that allowed? I would feel so weird.
as a french Canadian, I can say that the french written part was 100% accurate in term of translation.
Me: Is that window shadow actually the gobo?  Evan: This window's fake.  I KNEW IT!  Also, we know at least one window is real, the one with Joobie's catio ❤️
I would love to know what there dinner conversations are like 👍
I have a feeling that Evan's side table will need to be polished more often and eventually the two tables are going to be very different thicknesses
I think Passive Aggression would be a cool wrapper name!
Considering the chaos factor in this project, they turned out really well! And the matte finish somehow makes them look more solid and stone-like. Great job!  Now, what other household items are you going to marble? 😁
As someone who needs pitch black to sleep.. Glow in the dark bedside tables are my nightmare 😂
Rapper name: lil toe beans! ✨
Have you ever dropped a camera in resin
“It’s all true. It’s all real. Nothing here is fake. Nothing you see on this show is fake. It’s merely controlled.”     - Marlon
Is this more expensive than just buying marble?
Evan: there was one thing you did different with your resin than me! Me: the heatgun! Evan: no. 😢
Resinator and chaos
filming a vaintreriffic?
Katelyn's rapper name: Lil' Kat Meow Meow
This is a really amazing job yall did! The Marble coloration looks sooo good!
Where do you guys buy your resin and pigments? I wanted to play with some new art forms! I’ve done plenty of research 😂 and I can’t find a place to buy resin without possibly getting ripped off (I have before).
I'm not sure how much you can fix it, but there's a delay with the subtitles of a good few seconds :'(
The first bubble thing might have been the paint.
Your rapper name should be experimental lady
So you make it on the roof of Paris my love???? What did I just interpret?
Rap name twopaws
Somehow I read “resin marble” as “future resin” and I was totally believing you
The windows not real lol I'm shocked
36:58 - as a Matt myself, I can confirm it is very matte...
The touch of yellow actually isnt bad. There are yellow tones in the front design so it helps blend it into a piece. Also, its natural to have some mineral discoloration, so I think that would give it a more stone look than without the hint of yellow.
Ask Katelyn to put a tiny bit of glitter😉😻
The new tabletops: A+ The French subtitles: A++
I love that you two spent all that time and money making resin table tops look like marble instead of going and buying some actual marble. Quality content
How in the world was there a fake window?!? That’s epic.
I would've loved if you had added a wireless charger under there too. Great job you two!
wow these came out SO GOOD. The sanding to matte worked soooo well
Are you guys making a resin headboard next?
8:30 what is the plaid clown box doing in the background and why am I terrified of it?
Evan and Katelyn: we're not that type of channel captions: make love to me on the rooftops of Paris
missed you guys <3
Hahahahah, the resin time clip is awesome. 😂
My impression of Katelyn is “oop” when Evan doesn’t something she is just not comfortable with. The oop is from when they did blind folded muffins
Yikes, a white comforter when you have a fluffy black cat?! You guys are braver than I am!😂
Hoomans pat bed... Joob - WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?
Hope you guys are feeling better. Missed your chaos content. 😁
Making it matte totally took it to a different level
the matte top is so nice!! also i reallly wanna see you guys make “salt lamp” resin table tops that glow with pink
Greatest success yet!
DJ Soft Paws   Clearly your rap name should be Lil Whiskers
Lil soft Pauws maybe 😂
You should make something that says experimental lady on it
Missed a great opportunity for "Order Evan" to be the opposite of "Chaos Evan"
Loved the flying Bob Ross hair over Evan's head!😂 Those turned out great! 👏👏 A tip for veins from Rhonda on RK3 Designs, let the resin set up quite a bit, like an hour or so depending on surroundings, then drag a streak across the top!
3:57 "Oh noo! Our Paint! [It's broken]"
I actually love the hints of yellow, makes it more realistic as you can often find yellow patches and veins in marble
I love this! How long does the glow last before it stops? My only reference is glow in the dark stars I had on the roof as a kid, and they stopped glowing pretty quickly. I love all the ideas you come up with!
Can you make wall art for your bedroom's wall? it feels empty
Alright. After lurking for a while I subbed.
so happy to see you guys back in action and feeling better! I got covid around the same time as you and I know that, even with mild symptoms, it can be tough to get back up and running after!
Res'n and Tyme
Rapper name rough paws
I got so distracted by laughing at the French which at least is spelled right that I had to go back and listen to whatever Evan was actually explaining like three times 🤣🇨🇦
I know your happiness and playfulness really depends on how the pour goes, which you can't control, but this video was so much fun to watch. I enjoyed the calm pace compared to other pours and they turned out great!
Calm and Chaos
Katelyn’s rapper name should be Lil paws X
Resin is Evan proof... Got it...
I have to assume that Jube was chillin on the bed for the entire duration  of this project
omg, khaos katelyn!! how unexpected, haha. these turned out SUPER cute, you guys did a great job!
yo that intro had me all kinda confuzzled for like 1.6 seconds
They turned out so good Im not usually a fan of marble and was unsure about the matte look but it looks amazing
Love the Uno Reverse Evan pulled at the start where his pour was ✨controlled✨ and Katelyn’s was ✨chaotic✨
you should put cat ears on your resin helmets to be like SPACE JOOB!!!!
🤯🤓💪🏽👊🏽
I absolutely love how they lean into the "not that kind of channel!" joke. One of the best long running gags on YouTube. Plus I can watch it with my kid and he has zero idea.
dJ Eva-Lyn
"Were not that type of channel" is needing to be said more and more these days lol
"Make love to me on the rooftops of Paris" huh? Katelyn's getting saucy!
When is the the MC Catlynn and Old DirtyPawr album coming out then?
HIIIII
hehe I read the part in french...
DJ R K-ESIN
Just imagining this: Evan one week later: I think I forgot to add one detail to it, let me just quickly add another layer Katelyn: ok!  *process repeats every week until Evan’s side table is taller than bed*
if anyone asks about the yellow tint you could say oh its vintage classy marble and then *bang* turn off the lights and show them the glowiness
This is one of if not my favorite project y’all have done! Very nice!
As a french guy enjoying your videos for many months now, I have to say that the french part in this video really made me laugh
Fake window?!? How? What is that??
The way you guys brighten my day is unreal!!  Thank you for being such amazingly kind and creative people!  You've truly helped me through the hardest time in my life. My fiance of 19 years died 4 months ago and it's been truly heartbreaking. Thank you for helping me through it.
I saw the french part and I was like "wut, did I turned on the subtitle? Are my eyes tired?" and then the "c'est google traduction désolé" made me understand and I laughed so hard.
I don't think Evan is to blame for the table damage.  We have the exact same side tables and they are also damaged like yours were. I've been very careful and they still got damaged. I've been looking for ideas on how to refinish mine, this video has really inspired me. They turned out great.
you can clean the sticky residue from any tape with denatured alcohol
Katelyn's glasses are super cute.
Do a headboard next! Not necessarily out of resin, but choose your favourite headboard and then try to make it yourselves cheaper! Please 🙏 😃
Kay-Z
The one thing that bothers me about people doing marble resin designs is that they tend to always do the veins in one direction. Marble can often have veins going in all different directions, making a web-like pattern. I think having an understanding of how marble forms would be helpful to artists attempting to recreate the effect with different materials.
They really do come up with the greatest project ideas! 🔥🤩keep it up you two!
THEY LOOK SO GOOD!!!!!!!!
I don't now about Katelyn's rapper name but Joobs could be Lil Void
Is there a delay in anyone else's subtitles around the second half of the video or is my computer just lagging?
Can you repeat that?? I was too busy watching Joobie...  /ᐠ .ᆺ. ᐟ\ﾉ
*glances at thumbnail* ….“Oh hi chaos katelyn!”
Rapper Names: Katelyn: lil’ kit Evan: big kat
I haven’t watched y’all in about a year so glad to be back and now I have videos to binge
My french ass laughed out loud at the translation lmao  For a google translate one it wasn't bad 😂 Although nobody under the age of 115 says "sacre bleu" anymore 😂😂😂
I think it was the heat gun
Omg, those are some amazing nightstands. Love the glow effect. 💕
well... dj soft paws to just lil' soft paws
(in yoda voice) very innapropriate that intro was
People are going to start thinking that you ARE that type of channel 😂
:0 the fake window light was awesome. didnt even question it
the fake window is giving me trust issues! 🤣🤣
You've heard of Salt n Peppa, now meet Flamin Hawt and Lil Cheetoz. You can decide who is which (though personally I think Evan should be Lil Cheetoz for the fun hip hop irony)
I love the chaotic energy this had and yet the end result was sleek.  Nice
The fake windows took me on a ride.
Katlyn DJ name- Lil Sound boards
Katelyn's rapper name should be lil' toe beans
I stumbled onto your channel way back when you had a few dozen subscribers. Somehow, horror, I lost touch. Then you showed up in my feed again. Yes! My two favorite goofballs. I promise to never leave you again. Sorry, that was my bad.
Anyone else read the French...👀
This video came out on my birthday also loved it! 🥰
We NEED more Evan Ross😏
Next project should be making a headboard! ☺️
So I'm not even five minutes in and I have a concern... if they use clear resin, it will eventually yellow over time as Peter Brown has shown over on his channel.   Still love the idea and look forward to the end result.
29:15 "What do you think... Call it?"  Who are you, and what have you done to Evan?
that was the longest 3 weeks of my life 😭 so glad you're back and feeling better!!
Beautiful!!
They look amazing. But marble is super glossy normally. 😆 Also. Have you heard of pink marble? Gorg
Rapper duo could be Angy Boi and Lil' Bean
I immediately came to watch after I came from school!
Rapnip as in catnip.
Oh Boy! The really broken french made me laugh so hard! 🤣
Some gold veining in that final pour would have been totally sick.
I hav come to the conclusion that the resin gods were angry that Evan's first pour wasn't chaotic enough, so they brought the CHaoS themselves!!!
Stone
the fake window light blew my mind hahaha, nice work <3
Yo, those face masks. Where can I get them. They're not on your tool list
What are your chaos levels (Katelynn’s is at least 30)
Me being a nerd, id learn how real marble is formed to work out how to replicate the look.
Rappin' Katelyn = Jammin' DJ Juubz
Why did Kaitlyn change the words to RESIN TIME!? GAAAA
The rappers To and Beeen
16:09 Me who’s a French Canadian: oh lord-
Try stamping individual layers with plastic wrap during the gelatinous stages before pouring successive layers. It is similar to how concrete is stamped to give it a hewn stone look.
Me screaming at my screen he used paint. You both used the same black.
i love watching your videos because i feel like i’m learning so i feel productive even if i’m procrastinating from my homework >:]
this is so wonderfull *_*
Katelyn cool 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 The Katelyn nator Coolucorn Jube the COOL 🆒
I laughed out loud with the resin time edit
I can tell Evan definitely still felt a little icky at about 25:30, poor dudes voice got all rough 😔 glad you guys are better now. Hit you guys too, so glad you're okay!
Does anyone know what the French subtitles say around 16:20
The video: [starts] Me: Omg its happened! They ARE that kind of channel! xD
Evan's voice is so deep into this video it's tripping me out 😂
Les sous-titres en Français m'ont fait mourir de rire ! :D
Lil rez-n
I kinda liked Katelyns strands of glow there but Evan's did glow more
Im gald y'all used water in your commercial your pan would be damaged and it would have been a waste
I noticed there channel got more inappropriate over a while
Thats pretty cool but I do wonder if the glow in the dark part will make it hard to sleep.
I feel like if you really didnt like the yellow you could have added a touch of the blue glow to the one you were using to neutralize the yellowness.
Two minutes in and I’m excited just to see the tiny supervisor living his best life being comfy. 😆
I was screaming over Evan’s control and Katelyn and her +10 chaos the whole video 😂
Duo name: khaos krewe ft. the supervisor
Why didn't you use thick water as a resin stand in this time? Was this filmed before the video where you had the idea?
15 seconds in and I'm already laughing xD
Pretty sure her rapper name is Big Dirty Pour.
YAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY you guys posted
21:24 a husband putting in the work.
They look amazing!
I'm thinking this was less about Fixing the tables and more about Even needing A night light and not wanting to admit it lol
y'all are wrong for that steam ping sound
I am only 2 mins in and I already cringed at the idea of glow in the dark anything. I can not sleep with lights on, so I hope this doesn’t bite you in the butt later on 😅
Evans one had heat convection, causing it to mix in bubbles.
Before they mentioned the metal tape I was so confused as to how/why they were gonna incorporate an acrylic block into this lol
Aww man the intro made me look forward to the high tier patreon section of theirs.
They are gorgeous !!! I love them !!
I love how Evan takes full responsibility for scuffing the table
I really liked Katelyn's test piece even though it started so ugly
Rapper name submission: lil’beanz
I like your creativity and idea... But marble doesn't the design of your side table
Regarding your glass bead video, my mom has been making glass beads for 20 years, and if you would like she has offered to give you guys a free lesson.
Only Evan and Katelyn could make glow in the dark look classy, what a vibe
Omg I love y’all’s videos this one is hilarious y’all should totally make more like this!
dread pirate bubbles
Lil resin and big resin
Ther is a sprai paint for marble veins, maeby try that for the next stone project, I woud have used peel and stick marble foil 😁 and left it at that.
her nic name should be cat-lyn is rapping
MC Meow-Meow
The opposite of chaos Even is Grandma Even LOL!
Rapper names Big Mr Chaos and Lil Calm Cat
bon travail avec google translate, j'avais même pas remarqué
When evan turned off the window, I was like wait... WHAT?
Your act would obviously be called King Khaos and DJ Soft Paws. I will have to think on Katelyn's rapper name. Nothing beats DJ soft paws.
Need to do it like you do the other stuff, a base layer of white, then strips  getting darker, and hit it with the heat gun to push it around
The dressers are beautiful and everything, but why did the twist that it was actually night time just break my brain?
Evan and Katelyn with that ad break are quickly proving that they are indeed "THAT kind of channel" XD
you should've done warm grays.
So first the marble looks amazing you guys did a great job as always! Second; I freaking DIED when the french subtitles came in with all the added 'mon amour' and the spicy romance novel dialogue. That was so freaking good I legit had to rewind and rewatch that part like 3 times before I actually heard what you were saying that was so funny!!
you should play no man's sky on steam
Not even 10 minutes into the video Evan: completely gives up on precision and dumps everything into one cup to pour😂😂
This was great!
We already know your DJ Name...  DJ Rez Intyme
i just discovered this YouTube channel and they give off such good vibes, i think im gonna stay here :D
Man I really enjoyed this episode! You guys really knocked it out the park with this one 👏🏽 I even let the ad play to the end 😎 Keep it up guys!!
dj soft paws and hard words rapper
You need to 3D print cat ears for Katelyn's PPE
Have you try stone coat you tube for marble?
These came out beautiful!!!
DJ Soft Paws and MC Sharp Claws
I love this project! It turned out really well!!
You guys are AMAZING!!!! OMG...I love you guys!!!!! LOVE EVERYTHING about your video. Enjoy your new and improved tables. They are so cool and so pretty...so much better then all of Evan stretches, lol!❤️
Your bed needs a headboard
we've been blessed by a Joob-loaf!!!
I love you guys videos! Suggestion for a future video : to "classy up" your decor, you should do a headboard project...resin, wood, other thing you guys wanna try! I think it would look cool 🤩 I made one with wood thats like 6 inch deep because I cant put anything on my walls (cement walls) so I use that instead on the top 😁 like a double function headboard
27:06 "I think that something that's very *you* is being bothered..." _Katelyn immediately looks at the camera with a bothered expression_
Sussquach & lil pawze (rapper name)
So glad you're making content that is maker-y/diy-y again! Things were starting to get a little too typical youtuber-y click bait-y fun nonsense videos. They're fun, but this stuff is the best!
You are great, Evan learns more controll and Katelyn learns chaos
That opening shot with Joobie is just the best. She looks so regal!
I'm just having a nightmare thought that Katelyn accidentally spills nail polish remover all over the nightstand and all her hard work will be ruined
Make yourselves a resin HEADBOARD
Honest to goodness - I skip most every ad I see from other creators. But I watch Evan and Katelyn's ads EVERYTIME. They are just so darn entertaining.
Hi I have watched you for two years and love your vids. Keep it up!
What is the brand of the helmet respirator?
14:43  LAUGHING SO HARD RN!
Potential Rap names for Katelyn  Lil Resin Craft Shorty  Resin baby Queen Craft
Evan, I literally dropped my laptop into my pressure pot yesterday, so throwing electronics around is where I get ya!
It’s from air bubbles in the resin from stirring it with the stick… when they pop it pulls the other color into the black
word of the day: dirty pour
I normally really really don't like matte finishes, but in this case, it really did suit the project. Great job!
"fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris !"  Humm not sure that you ask Google translate to translate the text from Evan
NO! You can't tease me with resin taste testing then just pull away from it!  Damn you Hello Fresh! Damn you!  Qqá! (HelloFresh Destruction)  Also fantastic results. Loved it!
So pretty!!! They look great!
Glow in the dark is going to be so brights 😢we have glow in the dark on my remote and it lights the room
Lil soft beans - Rapper name submission
The final result looks awesome! Though the glow in the dark next to my bed would drive me crazy.
Evan's pour looks like sus at 23:28. Specifically the third line from the left. Do i just have a dirty mind?
the lights being a lie was the biggest shock of 2022
Are we just not going to mention the wireless mouse sanding block?
Glad you all are feeling better. I got the rona at the beginning of the year and even though I am vaccinated it really knocked me out. I can only imagine how it was wanting to create and couldn't. You guys are so fun to watch! Missed you and I'm glad you are feeling better.  I bet Joob was a great caretaker.
15:12 Bubbles y’all. Bubbles. Katelyn used the heat gun to pop her bubbles, Evan did not so his bubbles popped later and made it look real weird, like with acrylic pours.
Y'all should do a video with/inspired by Brothers Make.  Seems like something that would be in your interests, they have one of your stickers, and Matt looks like Evan!
That resin time took me out 😭
These turned out amazingly, and I love the way the glow powder blended with the marble streaks!
You should get boom mics that attach to your ear, that way the mics will be inside your masks. Then you will have less muffled audio.
Katelyn: I'm not even trying, okay?! = me whenever I'm losing at a competitive game
Rapper name for katelyn (Little katety kate)
When Katelyn looked directly at the camera all I could think was “prolonged eye contact”
These came out nice. I would love to see you guys try the techniques that Stone Coat Countertops uses.
Disregard the great marble tables they have FAKE WINDOWS?
DJ Leve Lit.
Are you worried about the glow being too bright to sleep with?
OW OW OW OW, RESIN TIME!
Hey guys great video! One side note: i noticed the CC is off a little bit after 23:40, maybe it's not that big of a deal, i just wanted to mention it :-)
23:28 ....has a penes!
Katelyn's rapper name would definitely be lil' dirty paws. You know. Like dirty pour except. I'll show myself out.
Oh my gosh this video was great guys! Thank you so much for creating and sharing! also as of yesterday, i finished listening to every episode of E and K podcast! :)
katelyn's rapper name would be lil paws
Joob is trying to nap and they’re just filming their intro, hitting the bed, wreaking havoc
I love the way these videos are edited. 👏👌😂
K.K. and Big E would be a cool rapper duo
Reminds me of batik techniques
Ehhh-maziiing
You Guys are so funny and a great job!
these turned out so good!!!!!
for the intro, I was imagining you guys talking like borat, and I nearly choked on my cheesecake  Edit: rough translation from 16:08  Evan: This proves it. This first, my love, here, my love, the first that I did, this is all google translate, sorry the Frenches, that this was done, my love, on the roofs of Paris! Katelyn: They were all two of the dips in tube, my love. Evan: Sacred blue!
30:40 katelyn's rapper name: Special Kate
This is up thier with the toilet seat!
"Future proof, for years and years and years"   All resin yellows. It'll take longer at least since you're using ink for the marbling.
24:26 residue...you mean RESINdue? lol
E&K conspiracy theory: They actually live in a windowless bunker.
My dog, Squidgy, has a shirt that says “I’m why we can’t have nice things” Evan needs a shirt like that cause the side tables can’t be the only thing that has suffered from his abuse!😂
The editing is killing me 😂 A+
Next time: add a wireless charger in the resin. ;-) Small indentation in the marble so the phone always aligns nicely.
You guys should experiment with colors in UV resin like in 3D printers.
Would be cool to embed a wireless charger in it!!!
Be honest, is your bedroom always that organized and clean? If so... What whichcraft are you using?
KitKat rapper?
Her rapper name has gotta be Lil' Piece.
These turned out so nice!! Loved the video!!
Those bedroom scenes were top quality. teehee, I make joke.
I love the tables they turned out amazing but can I just say how tricked I was by the fake lights and window, I'm still having a crisis because of it!
Cool project!! I'm sure you have seen the benefit of your many resin/marble pours which lead up to these table tops!!
Evan does a katelyn pour: Chaos Katelyn does an Evan pour: Pure precision.  You see, its not the pour, its the vibes.
Those tables look so good. Impressive. And unexpected lol
Rapper couple name idea: Joe and Mama, but Katelyn is Joe and Evan is Mama.
That sponsored segment...thought I had messages in steam. >.<
Lol katelyn pouring resin on a piece of bread 😂😂 i cant
Who else looks up to Evan and Katelyn.
I do allot of craft projects..involving Glue, resin, tape, all sorts of things.. And I also make up silly 'rap' when I get stressed.. My husband calls me lil'sticky.
18:16  “A little bit of Erica by my side, a little bit of Rita’s all I need…” (iykyk)
Rapper name: Reslyn
2 hours ago, hello early birds
Chaos evan and controlled katelyn
The slight yellow of the glow powder worked pretty well, because it helped cancel out the blue in the black powder dye, giving you more of a warm gray color. Color theory! Science! Well done!
Rapper name idea: katie kat the real small katelyn
The Role Reversal Couple of the Year.
I was eating while watching this and the "ow ow ow ow" instead of "do do do do" made me choke a little bit. Worth it!
Evan demon voice is crazy!
Evan it’s not that there’s yellow from someone peeing in your resin…it’s just a soft glow of sunlight from y’all’s FAKE windows!😂😂😂
I was dupped, I was Played!!! You guys owe me my "Do Do Do Do"... ok, yes I laughed but still!!! :P
How are you going to call that couple "cringy"!?! They try hard and are super cute. 😇😉
interesting effect of briefly transforming into various emojis. 8:00, 11:28
Tension.
suggestion: try some uranium epoxy glass or something like that next time maybe v:
me, who speaks english and french: very, very confused lmfao
wait why does katelyn look so tolll in this one?? Evan did you just install a permanent booster?
Was wondering since the last marble video if the "in-the-pot swirl" would give the marble look since I've found that it kinda does for soap making and yall have basically invented it yourselves here 😂 also have been contemplating that couple rapper name. Best I've come up with is "Kit & Chaos" 🤙🏽
DJ K8Lnn
Sacre bleu!
Can you do a video where you paint/turn your respirator helmets into something cool and cosplay-y?
That french part is actually really well translated
OH NO OUR TABLE IT’S RESIN
That was so beautiful! I love that they glow too.
I’m with Evan one this one. Bedside tables are meant to be USED.
Been with you for years an finally, finally it's happened. You become successful, you move house, Evan becomes reserved. Katelyn goes wild. What next eh?
Mext video Katelyn makes a cat head for her new DJ career.
Reverse day is January 25th every year. It’s also my sons birthday. I want one of those masks you two are wearing. How much are they? I had a piece of wood in my eye because I can’t afford one lol. I meet to get one tho.
The french subtitles though!! As a french guy, that caught me off guard :') 10/10
Wow I feel like it's been for ever since you guys posted a video on here
I have a question. Is there a reason for the base coat to be in resin or could the initial veining be painted on the surface instead?
Before you pointed it out, I had No Clue that it was night at the end
Wish you hadn't put that second layer of white overtop that beautiful marble look   😭😞😖
You need some cute things for on your face Shields. Maybe mustaches or monocles on reuseables stickers.
katelyn's rapper name: "lil toe beans"  😂
"No I don't like double gloving, you know I don't."   The way in which this is delivered is chef's kiss, textbook, long term relationship lol. I love to see it. <3
What happened to Evan and katelyn, they have switched personalities.  Khaos Katelyn
Now I wanna resin my night stands 🤣
“Oh nooo our paint it’s broken” 😂
Bhaahaha 😂 " our channel in a nutshell "  🤣 this was gold!!!
And now we know what their *next* project is going to be... *cough* *cough* Matching Headboard *cough*...
Got my “choose your weapon” merch in the mail last week! Stoked to have it! Also bought Minecraft from seeing you both stream your plays on your other channel. Excited to try it myself! Thank you for the content and merch! ❤️
Should check out a company/channel called stone coat counter tops. Masters of the marble resin
You guys are sorta like phineas and ferb in a way. One of you has trouble talking 😂🤣
MC Whispering Whiskers
"I heard the glow making noises" that's one crazy line, even for him.
I love this idea!  My daughter has a side-table like this.  In similar condition.  Plans are now afoot.
This video was such a delight!!!!!!❤️
Now a matching resin marble headboard!
Fake window shadow?I would have never have guessed, that's so cool.
Lil Toe Beans = Katelyns rapper name
Okay, today is officially the best day of the week. Evan, Katelyn, and the supervisor.  What more do we need in life? Thanks for the smiles 😊👍.
The French! I'm dead.. I had to stop and Google translate it. "Fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris!" Someone's bored editing :'D
Them uploading made my day!
Katelyn is EXTRA FLIRTY with the camera this episode and it killed me every time
"High Risk... high risk." Words to live by.
Rapper name: Lil Lady Purr Hiss (like Lil Bow Wow but for a sassy lady like Katelyn)
Oh ye a camera and lighting in a bedroom hmmmm yeeeee 😏
2:43 - 2:57 YALL REALLY SELF ROASTING OUT HERE XD  I swear I love you both xD thank you for your inspiration!!!
Oooo, I loooove the matte look. For my desk, I've been debating between glossy or matte and saw ads for stonecoat countertop stuff. I have no idea if it's any good since only their company posts anything about it....... I wonder if I could use like a metal polisher
😃 ✨ solve all of your problems, with resin ✨ 😃                                   **disclaimer you can not make food better with resin**
I think mixing the teal and the yellow glow power would have maybe neutralized the yellow a bit.
Intro be like: we're not that type of channel ✨👁️👄👁️💅
38:03 I'm not convinced that every wall and floor in your house isn't just a green screen and that you're actually still living in your old house. This "new house" is a sham.
Anybody know what those masks with active ventilation are called that they're using when pouring resin? I'm thinking about getting one for myself but don't seem to find anything in that direction on amzn...
A possible DJ name for Katelyn could be ‘DJ Resin Rebel’
rapper names: Rez and Pour
I have to say that I love the editing of these videos. It's just so high quality and professional, but with little details with texts here and there, and the DJ cat and stuff that just add so much personality to this channel. I imagine Evan and Katelyn watching the videos over and over questioning if this part understands correctly o if that part follows properly the rhythm of the editing... Prompts to you guys!!
Lol I love that little peek behind the curtain at the end, "All of our windows are fake, it's the middle of the night~" It's just crazy how you can make it look like broad daylight with some well placed lights 🤣 Everything is a lieee~
In my mind: Katelyn "Evan! J'accuse!" - Evan is why K. can't have the nice bedside tables 😉🤣
AMAZING WORK WITH THE EDITING, KATELYN!!!!!!
Katelyn's rapper name should totally be K-Resin (because you know: Resin. And first initial followed by Money is like a rapper name thing... Idk)
Plot twist, those cameras are always there.
"IMAGE NOT FOUND" 🤣 Yeah, I'm not sure about grid patterned marble 😆
Hold up hear me out, stained glass resin Tiffany style table lamps!!!!!
Now to design a matching headboard! Great work! They look fantastic!
Fake windows reminds me of Rick & Morty's Fake Doors.  These turned out vv nice. so classy. does Joob approve tho?
16:05 I'm French, and I feel obligated to translate thoses subtitles for those who do not speak French xD "Cela le prouve" -> "This proves it" "Ce premier, mon amour" -> "This first, my love" "Ici mon amour" -> "Here, my love" "Le premier que j'ai fait" -> "The first I did" "C'est tout google translate, désolé les français" -> "t's all google translate, sorry French people" "Que c'était" -> "That it was" "Fais moi l'amour sur les toits de Paris" -> "Make love to me on the roofs of Paris" "Ils étaient tous les deux des dips en tube, mon amour" -> "They were both dips" (dip in French refers to chip dip, or cracker dip, that kind of dip) "in tube my love" "sacre bleu" -> this is light swearing, google translate says "damn it", why not.
I'd like to love to see 2+ glow powders marbled
None of us are real. And neither are you. Everything is a simulation.
Poor Evan, his sick voice in the last part of the video
“Probably particle board”
4:54 to 5:05    Resin time resin time   Ow 😓 ow 😓 ow 😓 ow 😓   Resin time
safiya and tyler want to make a video with you guys!!! I would love to see it
Hmmmm a camera pointed at there bed with lighting 🤔     Must be making an only fans
I constantly smiled throughout the entire video
Your videos cure my depression
This video is essentially how the inside of my brain functions. I am glad y’all can represent that in a video 😂
Can you make resin but cross it with the garden? 😳
smol Boi chaos and bigg boi chaos in the house
What the heck happened at 4:10??! What was that all about?! Hahahaha! You did good, and you earned the right to be proud! Loved it!
What if the table tops were removable so you could customize them over the years. You now have a solid piece to make a mold and do a solid resin top that you can switch out. Just an idea from an indecisive person lol :)
The handshake at the end really tells a story of a job well done.
I don't know if I would want a table glowing next to my face while I'm trying to fall asleep.
I know this is a family channel but one day I'm going to make a supercut of all the innuendo (intentional or not) jokes
You guy have made me wanna get into resin art like making key caps or even wood resin art.
Stronk Black 🤣
You are soo turning into "That type of channel"
Thank you..
You should've watched the Stonecoat counter tops videos! 😀
Very cool! The only change I would make is using some diffuse LEDs at the back or something to create the glow instead to of glow in the dark stuff so I could turn it off for sleeping. I like a pitch black room. Hehehe.
Great video! The turned out amazing. You guys have that marble effect nailed down.
Chaos Katelyn makes an appearance! 😄
totally NOT that kind of channel 😂😂
I've watched some of your podcast and learn about the reason of using those cool respirators and I agree, just wondering, are you using any polarization in the lenses?
Laughed way too much at "image not found" for a grid of marble
Glad to see you guys back 🥰🥰🥰🥰
now you need to DIY a headboard! hahaha
"Cat eye KK" should be Katelyn's rapper name
y'all have THAT for an intro and still claim ~nOt tHaT tYpE oF ChAnNeL~
if you need ideas stone coat countertops is amazing :)
The reason why the black line is having white cell's is, the black is heavier then the white color. The black is opaque the white is transparent.
Petition for Katelyn’s rap name to be Lil Toe Beans
Hate to be a downer but this project was NOT APPROVED BY THE SUPERVISOR!?
These came out beautifully!
🎶Resin time, resin time, ow ow ow ow resin time! 🎶
You need to make something to place above the bed, it's pretty empty there
I can't believe the window is fake!! Didn't even know that was a thing you could buy, fake window light
That pillow just made it a hundred times better
Somebody please get Evan a catch all tray so that nightstand survives... cause that looks too pretty to need to be re-finished any time soon!
you know RK3 Designs ?! Nice techniks
Iow iow iow iow resin time
Missed opportunity to do put Shrek in when he said "lAyERs" lol
Hey, why do you guys do the sanding before the resin pour  in a single direction? My instinct is to go in circles, but IDK.
Ok my idea for your rapper duo names is: Tall Boyeee and Small Pause🐾
For those who are wondering what the french section means, i put in google translate for y'all ---> this proves it this first my love here my love the first I did that's all google translate sorry the french that it was make love to me on the roofs of paris they were all the sweetness of the dips in a tube my sacred blue love.     (I may have messed up spelling because the part where it says "sorry the french", it was supposed to say "sorry french people".)
Leader Evan and Queen Katelyn are _the_ rapper duo.
Katelyn bringing the chaos and Evan sounding vaguely composed? It really is reverse day!
Moral of the story use resin to fix you're life
I'm french people, no, i dont want de te faire l'amour sur les toit de Paris  But I laugh so hard for this part of the vidéo
@evan I think the wet under coat probably had a bigger effect than the type of dye.
Those stands look amazing. And suddenly a lot more expensive too.
Question.......... why does Evan have a computer mouse with sandpaper on the bottom?....
5:00 nice remix. 😂
Evan and Katelyn make a… cool ass resin project
Lol Katelyn being the chaotic one in this project made me smile so big lol
DJ Kat Ly ("Cat-lee")
What about supervisor approval 🐱❔❔
Ayo the intro though hmmmm ayo
Are y'all going to play dying light 2 on the gaming channel
This has kinda soapmaking vibes Would be intresting to have a soapmaker (katie) try different soaptechnices on resin
The image not found when Evan talks about grid marble💀
I'm glad to see that you both are well and healthy 💙💙💙💙
Evan and Katelyn: Slaps the bed, getting super excited, loud voices Kitty: "Don't look you'll just encourage them"
How much have you actually used the velvet keyboard
If it was still sticky from the tape I’m pretty sure that you can use isopropyl alcohol to remove the sticky residue
Why not fold the taco….. lol
Iv been seeing online of videos were a laser Burns things into like phone cases and remotes and other objects would it be possible for y'all to do one of those videos
window of lies !!! how could you ?!? :D pretty table tops ! you guys did great! i even really like the alien glowy bits <3
Kate clawz and chaotic E are your guys rapper names
I don't think Glow was the way to go it should have been glitter✨✨✨
i liked Evan's test better
Y'all should make cat shape silicone mats for the floor🐾🐱
Sacre Bleu !
The pig tails made me think of the joke from the beginning 🎥🎬🌽🌽
With all the dirty pours you do, you should try those split cups I see on Etsy and the like where there's compartments for the different colors
Every single video I've seen and there make me laugh everytime 🤣 thank you for making are lives brighter all three of you.
Love the subtle Bob Ross reference.
Katelyn, your rapper name should be Lil' Cheeto
Katelyn, I just want to acknowledge my appreciation of your editing (I am pretty sure you do the editing). All the details of things that you do in there that most people won't even notice... fantastic.
Keeping the creative juices flowing. Thanks E&K. Looks great and nice glow effect too.❤
Did you come across Legarri Product vids in your reseaech? As a total arm chair observer, I feel like some of what you've done could benefit from their expertise. Like the right base paint for furniture epixy pours. The tables look great.
After that intro - cue me imagining Evan drop kicking everything across the room.
Another masterpiece 🤩 bootiful 😍
Kinda surprised to not hear "We're not that kind of channel" after the opening joke.
Your bedroom....all the room for activities!
Dj name for Katelyn is k k Katelyn
Rapper name: Lil K Res'n
I was offended by the French translation (I'm French) (I wasn't really offended) but no one says sacrebleu 😂
The ow remix of resin time made me laugh so hard.
Katelyn’s first one looks like Jupiter in the dark 🥰😍
It's so beautiful 🥺
69 funny and love ur vids bc i like experimenting but i need someone to experiment with
Omg the editors were fantastic, i love the improvement, I've been following Evan and Katelyn for almost 3 years and the editions are one of my favorite parts of watching the videos 💜
As cool as it is, I would hate the glow-in-dark. I need full darkness to sleep😬
love u guys
Wow they turned out so beautiful
Ayy another video, hi <3
There’s nothing better than having a mental breakdown and skipping work then watching Evan and Katelyn to come down and out of it. By then end of this video, I could finally breathe normally again. Thank you both so much. Your videos mean a lot to me. ❤️
HAHAH the "ow ow ow ow" in resin time XD      Also i know it has been this in a while but i just realized y'all actually did the thing where i suggest you guys include the current video's "resin time" preview into the jingle! (Idk how to say it and i might have been on my other account when suggesting that) not gonna say i take credit for it but its still cool to see haha
Wtf... I assumed there wouldn't be a video today and while I was looking for restoration videos, I found this. I mean, what are the chances? I haven't looked for restoration videos in months...
Evan: "Is it reverse day today?" Me: "Kaos Kaos Kaos"
A wedding resin. Keep the memories forever.
I watched a bunch of old videos while y’all were recovering/on a break and I just have to say @ Katelyn your editing skills and comedic timing have blossomed 😍 Love u guys 💖
16:15 EVERYTHING IS GOOGLE TRANSLATE AND IT’S NOT EVEN THAT BAD WHAT 😭😭😭 Wait no but that was peak humor 😭😭😭
Chaos Katelyn!!
Rapper duo name: Two Paws (rest in peace Tupac!)
speaking of making food better with resin… how are the toast coasters doing???
5:02 ahaha nice touch with the “ow, ow, ow, ow”😂
Omg yay perfect timing. Just finished a long week of academic tests. I can now relax and watch Evan and Katelyn :D ^__^
Oh my god, they really are that kind of channel now.
immediately starting on a sex joke makes me know this is bound to be a wild episode LOL
Haven’t you guys ever seen a Stonecoat Countertop video?  Come on guys!  Check them out!
That was probably my favorite version of the Resin Time song
Rapper duo names: Chaos and Lil' K
Resin Time, Resin Time, oW Ow oW Ow Resin Time
Resin may be future proof BUT is it Evan proof?!?
3:58 Oh no, our paint...it's broken.
The french bit was superbe!
Rapper names: Katelyn: Lil' Chaos Kittie Evan: Big Chaos Cat
With a custom resin top you could make/put a small bowl in the resin to hold phones and keys
Wait, is your sanding block thing an old computer mouse? Because that is actually really smart
Hiii
“Classy glow in the dark marble furniture” what I aspire my house to be
Hey guys, maybe you could try to get some polarized lens for the camera to remove the reflections on the breath masks.
When our cat sits in the corner of the bed like that we call her "bodega" cause those are on corners sometimes
i loved that intro , my type of humor xD  we love a good camera in the bed room obviously the only thing we can record there is intros to our projects .. clearly nothing else can be recored in a bedroom
As a french speaker I loved those french subtitles that had nothing to do... Quite spicy!!! Hahahaha.....
The way Katelyn says “I dunno~ ❤️ “ 🥰
Just yesterday I was missing you guys! You two always brighten my day with your enthusiasm and positivity thank you for existing.  I greatly appreciate you existing 😄👉👉
16:08 French translation provided by Google translate:   This proves it this first my love here my love the first one i did  thats all google translate sorry France  what was it  make love to me on the rooftops of Paris  they were both tube dips my love damn it
The french part! Abolutely hilarious, made me laugh so much 😂 thanks for that 👌❤️
3:39 Yeah, but the stone can also have a polished finish (maybe satin too) 🗿💎
Your rapper names with the masks are daft and punk separated
I feel bad for Even’s side table it’s so scuffed up
I've never felt more betrayed by a fake window reveal in my life
Amazing job with the French subtitles, guys! 10/10, really spoke to the heart! ❤️
Italian Spiderman lives on!
Do do do do Resin time!
Oh merci pour les sous titres. I would translate your jokes in French anytime ! Love you here.
Omg the French subtitles 😭😂
New rapping name: the raping resiners
Omg they turned out soooooo great! Now I wanna do it to everything 🤣
🥳🥳🥳 So much joy when you guys post!
Who is surprised that Evan’s chaos has permeated their entire lives?
All the love from france, your content is has always really entertaining and we always learn a thing or two. You deserve every like and views you make keep it up.
Katelyn's editing > the rest of YouTube
You guys are the best youtubers ever <333 love you
I just so happen to be wearing my "Resin Time" shirt!!!! 🎶 🥰 🎶
For a second I though you were doing a Joobie photoshoot at the beginning before I decided to read the title. But in all seriousness she's a lovely model :P
intro: *"we're not that type of channel" intensifies*
Evan’s doesn’t look bad, it looks great as an effect, it’s just not like marble.
This edit, tho 😻💖
I'm glad you guys are feeling better! I've missed ya'll omg!
I just noticed the size difference between yall😂
14:24 maybe the black is more dense than the white and the white wanted to rise and the black wanted to fall. And the black thin line was so thin it fell all together or was too light to fall. I dunno
I also love the editing and music 👏🏻 ❤️
Hey look! it's like the start of my photography career.
that start made me laugh
why else would the camera be set up in your room ? right..??
You guys inspire me        :)
does hello fresh do meals that help you put weight on & keep it on by chance? :/ am struggling hard with my weight, it keeps fluctuating between 9 & half stone to 10 & half stone :( xxx
It’s ok Evan, words are hard 😂
I’m only 3 minutes in and I can’t stop smiling. Isn’t it just a Evan thing to do..don’t learn to be gentle with nice things…just make them harder to destroy 🤣🤣 I’m pretty sure my hubby would agree with him 😉. You two are awesome, ok gonna go see how it turns out 💚
Nice to see E&K get dirty (not that kind of channel).  Tables look great.
The pillow is always watching you🙃🙃
“It’s EXPANDING. It’s CRACKING”
Evans messed up in the beginning because he put new resin on top of drying resin. But the strand that “survived” was put into the drying resin
heyyyyy im 15 and im gonna get a job soon and hopefully be able to subscribe to your twitch! im very excited
babe wake up evan and katelyn just posted
The serotonin I get when the resin time resin time DO DO DO DOO resin time rolls 🥰
It’s beautiful and i loved the music from the beginning of the video. I didn’t speed y’all up just because I was enjoying it so much. You need to seal them with a matte poly acrylic or polyurethane to help keep it clean. When you sand some thing to make it matte it is rough and gets dirty easily making it a bear to clear. The matte poly has an additive to make it matte. The rough surface from the sanding helps it stick. If you have any questions just ask.
Evan the bob, Bob the Evan…? 😂
Cool
Cat
“The cringe couple” 😂 I think you guys are a fun, creative, smart, and amazing couple ❤️❤️❤️
I thought supurrrvisor was starting an OF for a second..
Chaos Katelyn and calm Evan? Wooow opposite day
19:00 I want to break this one into “rocks” and drop it in a new project
This is why I never buy anything new- then I don't have to stress about scuffs 😂. I support adding resin regardless 👍👍👍
how are you guys?? its been a while haha
Katelyn hit her resin with hot blower, what could have accelerated her resin curing. Making it less likely to mix up with the new black vein line.
what the heck is on his head D: 4:23
Love the turquoise.
I’m so happy you’re back!! 🥰
I love the French captions, what a lovely touch 😂
I like the resin time dance, that adds mojo to your efforts!
I think Evan’s did that weird thing because of the paint underneath
perfect time for my dinner 🤍🤍
Ow ow ow ow. Love it. Also do you still have the protective film on your respirator masks?
The adult joke of the year?  I think yes
Katelyn gets sassier and sassier towards Evan's chaotic-ness every video 😂
:]
The on going meme of "we're not that type of channel" is still strong
"Why are you setting up a video camera in our bedroom?" ... NOT THAT TYPE OF CHANNEL
I just came to say that i am in love with this new Katelyn haircut, waiting for my bangs to grow so i will have the same length as you 😍😍 love you both guys
Resin time Resin time ow ow ow ow Resin time is going to be my new ring tone.
Love this<3
Great timing 😃
Two words! Resin Headboard!
Aaaah! NEVER been to one of your videos this early! Love you guys, just started the video, cant wait to see what ensues. 😊 Give my best to Joob.
Oh im early early
HIIIIIIIIII
“We’Re GoinG tO mAke tHeM gLoW iN tHe dArk!   *Evan smacks on bed twice*
Why do I have some doubts about this video? 😖
I saw the video and thought I don’t think I’ve seen this one yet then realized it’s 8 minutes old
Yay!!! Live stream last night. New video today. Uncut upload tomorrow. Practically spoiled over here!!! 👏👏👏👏
Wow 40 minutes and we still couldn't fit everything in! Like Evan's near-miss accident... There's a 15 minute Aftershow for Patreon ( https://www.patreon.com/evanandkatelyn ) & YouTube members ( https://bit.ly/eandk-join )
Oh No, our paint, it broken!!
We don’t see their whole lives but I can’t think of two people who belong together like theM
Jooooob!!
thank you so much for uploading with captions. its rare to see full captions ready when the video premiers
I want “Classy glow-in-the-dark” to be my interior design philosophy.
katelyn didn’t say her famous line “we’re not that type of channel” in the intro smh
I’m actually early for once omg!
Missed you guys!!! So excited for this video 🥰🥰🥰 hope you guys feel better!!
ow ow ow ow resin time 😂😂
I am much excitttteeee. I'm glad you guys are feeling better :D
Some peoples kids came running when they heard your new episode, meanwhile I the "adult"  came running when I noticed haha. I love you guys so much! Thank you for everything ya'll do!
Resin time  Resin time Do  do  do  do Resin time
Its great.
Perfect timing. I’m putting my little down for her nap. Now I have something to watch!!
Love you guys  Evan being a supportive Bean  so cute you two
Just in time for my Lunch Break!!
Fancy!
It might be future proof but is it Evan proof? 😆
Everything is awesome with glowy resin, chaos Evan and dark Katelyn. MEGA HYPE!
WOOOOOO Evan and Katelyn here to cure my sadness <3
As someone who has dented and scuffed their desk I understand how your side tables look. Plus being a lefty there are pencil marks EVERYWHERE
Congrats if you are early and saw this comment :) 🎉
i was watching one of Evan and Katelyn’s old videos, and then they posted!
I just love them❤
This is how amazing you guys are! My kids came running when they heard your new episode dropped. 😆 and 40+ comments in under a minute! Keep being you!
I don’t think I’ve ever been this early! I look forward to when they post! One of my favorite creators!
I empathize with you evan it's very hard for me to keep my furniture not scuffed 😔
It's not that kind of channel!
Love what you guys do 💖
Hell yeah
It's weird to be this early
At least you’ll keep this table longer than the beer!! And they’ll be better than that beer too!! 😆❤️ love you guys!! 😁
We make joke? What joke? Oh no. I need sleep.
Just what I needed on this boring "ice" day.
"He he we make jokeee~" Katelyn is adorable 😭😭 also I did not expect this much Katelyn chaos and Evan control in this video 😂
<3
I love you guys so much, you are such a cute couple and ur cat is the greatest supurrvisor, I think your rapper duo should be "Jube and the supervised"  Sorry if I spelled ur cats name wrong lol
I’m so glad you guys feel better 🥰
Just when I had nothing to watch, Evan and Katelyn came to save my boredom!!
It's 2 am but i must stay up to watch! Also, love your content!
