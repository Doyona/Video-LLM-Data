3:40 bedrock players have been able to do this for a long time not sure when you were able to though I started playing around when reeds were a thing so Minecraft for me has been a timeless void of updates bedrocks players have also always been able to put lava in cauldrons
When I started playing Minecraft ( 5 years ago ) I made an under water roller coaster, I thought he would all ready know that!! Or maybe because I play on iPad 🤷🏼‍♀️

U have been aloud to place rails underwater for ages lol
dying by being frozen is a cool death xD
its real peupl
the tropical fish one is false because you cant tame axolotls and they attack hostile mobs normaly
If you hold a fish you die they won’t fight for you they are programmed to fight guardians not fight for you
that iam saying
Myth: can u do jeb_ on goats?
Myth: i love this channel
you don't need to hold the tropical fish for the axolotls to attack guardians... like so mau can see I guess?
Axo’s are better than diamond amour and weapons

You don't need a tropical fish it's actually an achievement to kill a mob with an axolotl but you have to help
They still spin you forgot to put the block around the Lillypad
The mlg snow bucket will be useful in the nether I mean you literally did it in the nether
wow glow squids are so cooool . i was being sarcastic but the sign its cool
The brown Axolotl is the rarest mob
Myth: if you place lava and then a glow lichen the lava will become water Myth: powdered snow can extinguish fire

Mznzmzn
Most of these aren’t myths they are features that Mojang added and announced
Myth: Wearing leather boots prevents you sinking into powdered snow! P.S Please try this :)

Just as disappointing as the emerald armor
you sound like jagster
In the infinite lava source myth, I was so close to commenting on it but then
We
Myth that if you were let her boots you could parcour gust say my name in vidio saying  Aubrey Wilfred pls pls,

Uhhh.. You always could put lava in the cauldron, much before 1.17 on top of that.

Myth #1 to me, and other bedrock players: *already been a feature in ours*
Actually I’m pretty sure they attack guardians and elder guardians  no matter what            ( 4:21 )
another way to get infinite lava, dig 6 blocks, and have 6 buckeys of lava. fill in eacj square and now u have infibite lava source.

—————————————————————————— Btw you don’t need to hold a fish for Axolotls to attack guardians, because they attack the following naturally: Guardians, Elder Guardians, Drowned, Cod, Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish, Squids, and Glow Squids.  One thing you can do with tropical fish is breed them, specifically with a bucket of tropical fish. —————————————————————————— You can also use the drip stone method for water too, which is useless but still. Also instead of becoming instantly completely full, it will fill up slowly. ——————————————————————————
Myth: if you set your self on fire, get into a boat, and then drive into a waterfall you can be on fire underwater
No fish on goldfish they're going to hit it so that miss is busted attack on sight okay

Knew you can freeze to death in Minecraft & use leather armor to help
If water can't be in the nether if you hold a water bucket in the nether then wouldn't evaporate

5:09 DUDE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
Myth 11 you need place blocks around lily pad and he or she start spining
myth: if you open a door on yourself you can jump on it
Myth:you can find pink slimes in dungeon
Most of these are just thing mojang already confirmed, which is where the "myths" come from.
I love you myth busting videos.
If you were on bedrock, you coud have already made underwater rollercoasters lol
Axolotls attack enemies even if ur not holding fish

5:35 It's REAL!
Plot: Mau already knew what was and wasn’t true about Minecraft 1.17 but continued to make this video regardless due to 1.17 related videos trending rn. He did it for the views.
i basicly only clicked this video cuz it showed that the amythest worked :'(
You need a amedist crafting bench and a button to make it work

Myth:if you name a pillager "johnny" they will attach all kinds of mobs
4:45 this is semi-true. Axolotl attack all fish, squids, drowned, and guardians on sight without provocation. They also won't follow you if you have tropical fish, you need a bucket of tropical fish (fun fact: Axolotls will only eat live fish in real life). Then they will follow you, but they will stop when you switch to another item. To make them follow you, you just need to feed them with the bucket of tropical fish. Then they will follow you for a little bit.
Myth: you will burn inside coldroun even with fire resistance
Can you place the bucket of the new fish in the nether
If you place ice in the nether you can get water
A lot of these aren’t myths they are just things that mojang has added
Then what’s the point of adding amethyst if you can’t use them for anything

In bedrock, glow signs look different. Did you know : In bedrock when you could 1st color signs, for some reason the color would glow ever before the Caves and Cliffs update was out? It lasted for a day or 2. I don't know why but its just I noticed the sign was glowing.
I can see why people hate this guy so much.

Bruh you can craft armor with data pack
You HAVE to watch this 6 Year Old play Minecraft! People are saying he's the next DREAM!! 😯🔥⛏️⚔️
Axoloth (idk) starts spinning on enchanting table lol
This man read the patch notes and called them myths
Does a Wither still attack an Axolotl even if it's playing dead?
on every single myth i predicited if it was true or false and i was correct on every single one of them   I know my minecraft
We all tried to make copper tools as soon as we got it don’t deny it ;)
Myth 11 is true, pther users tried but it spins
The wonderful knickers comprehensively memorise because level byerly dislike as a glib second. meaty, swift bail
i love that mod
You sound like MrBeast.
The axolotls attack any marine life ecept dolphins and turtles
Fun fact: if you try to craft something that dont exist in creative you cant make it :)
Myth #9 is both because they kill guardians even without the fish
1:42 looked way too wrong
You don't need a tropical fish for the axolotal to attack.

Anyone having the idea of a underground rollercoaster with a chest and respiration helmet chest at the beginning?

Very intertaning
I play 1.17 survival for 2 day and never found cave lol
You don’t need any tropical fish for the axolotls to help, also skeletons turn into strays if they freeze
Basically every “myth” in the video were a mentioned feature that mojang mentioned themselves.
Why did you even test the glow ink sac on a sign it’s literally an achievement same with the powder snow vs leather armor freezing in powder snow, fighting along side axolotls and milking goats are not achievements, but they’re just common facts about the update that you should have known I give the underwater roller coaster a pass because that was very early on in the snapshots and it’s kind of a secret the raw metals are kind of a big deal how did you miss those in the snapshots the lava farms were announced at minecraft live how in the frick could you possibly miss that without living under the world’s biggest rock
ITS OUT.
inf lava source by using dripstone stone and dripstone blocks?  bruh just go to the nether lol
I love that they did a custom death message not like player.froze.death

Myth that i got confirmed the hard way: When you stand in snow in creative, you start to shiver and its a cute animation with my skin
Myth: You can place rails underwater Me: You can in bedrock because first time I played Minecraft it was bedrocks edition and you can do so
Anyone else notice that you pick up ice with the bucket now in 2:46

Bruh most of this was already confirmed
1.17 is already here
I can’t believe he didn’t realize the rere axolotl
MOD
LIED
STOP LYNG
FAKER
FAKE I TRIED THAT
Glow signs weren’t a myth Minecraft admins said it
can you try this for 1.17: when you pop a fire res potion and put lava in a cauldron you still take damage
1:41 ok that weird
Hes just showng 1.17 updates thats all
Play with Macrymy
You use amethyst for making a spyglass
It's not true axolotil kill mobs that live underwater
About the axolotl myth I'm pretty sure that they just attack all underwater mobs apart from turtles and dolphins.
In bedrock we had lava in cauldrons for years and now you guys are just getting it
Awesome how MINECRAFT is still relevant after all these years!
some of these are just 1.17 features and others are just ones you know are wrong and that amethyst chestplate in the thumbnail too please, stop.
4:30 you don't need the fish, they will attack it anyways.
myth:you can subscribe to mau for free
A jeb_ goat would be funny
The temporary peanut preauricularly extend because restaurant differently surround versus a like plow. changeable, nutty observation
but... you dont have to hold the fish...
rails underwater have been there since half of the ps3 updates
it could be really good if they add amethyst tools but like u know 8n amethyst geodes (idk i probably write wrong) there is a block u can’t take that creates the actuall amethyst we could take them with netherite and amethyst tools could be stronger than amethyst so netherite won’t be useless and we can make even more tools
myth: use a name tag "jeb_" on a goat
WhY CaNt MiNeCrAfT ReLeAsE 1.17
I did'nt now the nether doe'snt exist
2:05 That was a myth?  Hmm, thought everybody knew

Lava Cauldrons and Underwater rollercoasters were already a thing in Bedrock Edition 1.16. I just want to let you know.
W
the lava cauldron was first introduced in bedrock
You don't need to hold a tropical fish so the axolotls fight the guardian
Most of these aren’t “myths” Most of this was specifically mentioned by mojang as a feature

U can shake in snow
I like mag snow
You dont have to hold a tropical fish for the axolotls to fight
Yesterday Minecraft update in 1.16 it now 1.17
B
Freezing to death in snow aint a myth its a well known fact, aswell as using leather to protect you from snow, and most of these are not myths aswell, for example the oxelotol with the fish one, Im not saying this is not a good youtuber, just saying you should fix your titles and stuff.
Thought it said Minecraft method
I'm pretty sure you can make rollercoasters underwater long before this update
You can freeze to death in the nether
axolotls will attack really any hostile mob
it doesn't matter weather hes holding a tropical fish or not
xD
In bedrock 1.16 i can place a lava bucket in couldron
2:24 I'm pretty sure you have to dye the sign first and it will make the dye color lighter

You could always put lava in a cauldron  /give @p cauldron_8
you could always use rails underwater at least i could
3:39 ngl i thought that he was actually standing on the water
Axolotls will attack guardians and other underwater mobs like squid even if you are not holding tropical fish.
Some of these myths r not really myths like the being able to milk a goat they devs say it in the minecrft live I think and the glow signs were also said and being able to freeze they also say that on the announcement of it
It's in the 1.18 update all of the update but is the other half of nothing when the warden is there an embassy Simon you can cuss word amethyst crafting table
LOL
Bruh axelotles attack any hostile mob does not have to have a tropical fish or not
Ok I don't know if I'm right or not but on ps4 you can't put looting on a bow anymore
STOP NO DYE GOAT NOOOOOOOOOOO
so, if a human can survive the coldness of powdered snow why not the undead
“So you can now place lava in couldrons in the new 1.17 update”  Bedrock players: hey ive seen this one Java players: what are you talking ABOOT its brand new
Hes acting like all these features are so crazy and shit when majority of these are common knowledge and things everyone already knows. Not myth busting
i'm so disappointed that i can't craft amethyst tools and armor :(
What happend to copper
1:30 3 2 1 goat

Most of These aren’t exactly myths, but more like features
4:30 minecraft summoner      not sorry for the terraria meme
Myth: you can actually put any block on hoed wet grass
DREAMMMM
I like that as soon as he says what myth he's testing, it's so obvious if it's gonna work or not.
OK I DIDNT KNOW U COULD MAKE GLOW SIGNS
This update is so sad-
Myth 1 is incorrect, they fixed it
I found out that you can milk goats

For the axolotls attacking gaurdians is already a thing you dont need fish or anything they already attack them in water

M A U THAT WHEN TROPICAL FISH IN YO HAND AIN'T NEEDED YOU CAN JUST NOT HOLD TROPICAL FESH AND THEN THEY WILL STILL ATTACK OTHER SEA CREATURESSSSS S
Dude most of these aren't myths! Most of these were confirmed at Minecon live!
I don't think the axolotls attacking the guardian was about the fish but guardians, squids, fish, etc are natural enemies of axolotls.
Bruh, some of these aren't even myths. They literally announced some features, like freezing in powdered snow, glowing signs and not falling through powdered snow (which even has an achievement), shaking mobs, fortune on all ores,
Can't wait to make axolotl my bodyguard :)
How do you have the 1.17 update
4:35 they fight regardless
I don't want to be rude,you're voice kinda sounds like lazarbeam
aku mau mqkan kamu wkwk
THESE. ARE. NOT. MYTHS THESE ARE JUST FACTS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS NOONE WOULD ASK THE QUESTION AS SPECIFIC AS DO RAILS WORK IN WATER AND DOES LEATHER ARMOR MAKE IT SO YOU CANT FREEZE
Did you know that if you put a skeleton in snow long enough it will become another type
Mau try this myth A bucket of snow might put you out of fire
“Don’t worry about everything; instead pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.”
Myth=change your ui profile to pocket and make beacon and put 1diamond and start clicking it it will be double
Mau apa lol    Translate: (want what lol)
With tropical fish in a bucket the axoltel will follow you
Java players and youtubers: the cursed things evolve! Me and the bedrock gang: wat we did dis already
Infinilava was real beforr
The bright bee overwhelmingly cause because cook bareilly muddle pace a hurried plough. envious, panicky care
i like how most of the myths are actual features
this isnt myth busting you have just read the 1.17 patch notes looked at all the new features and are presenting them as myths and the ones you are "busting" is just made up bs that sounds ridiculous.... how are ppl not noticing this
Just do random tick speed: 1000 lol
The “burning underwater” in a cauldron one is technically true but you are not burning, you are diving to the lava. Also burning doesn’t do that much damage
Bro your videos are cool.
I already play in 1.17

"Sorry buddy" is the nicest thing a man could say to a creeper
Actually you have to hold a bucket of tropical fish and they will follow you, they killed the guardian becuase they will do that if you hold a bucket of tropical fish or not
1.17- Snow Clutch
Dripstone fills cauldrons with liquids that are above dripstone
I am not trying to be that type of person but almost all of those werent myths they are all stated in the minecraft wiki but I guess its good for people who doesnt want to stay 30 minutes like me reading about the new update, also axolots attack guardians in general like they attak fish and squids so you dont need to hold the tropical fish
4:45 um, even if you don’t hold fish, they’ll still attack stuff.
open bedrock ?
Polarsaurusrex is going to need the powder snow mlg method.

Use a lead on an axolotl

You can also put lava in cauldron in 1.16.2, too in bedrock Edition only I think
Dream watching the powdered snow mlg:   Intresing...
What’s sad is that I didn’t even know you can put lava in a cauldron
BTW i'm still in 1.16 i have to wait 1.5 year BRUH : (
Hate to be that person but bedrock had some of these aleeady
At that time: every Gamer on youtube: checks out fortnite season 7...  Mau: busting minecraft 1.17 myths...
Myth: you can subscribe to mau
I have a switch and Minecraft has the new update early and it has the new stuff 👍
4:48 they attack glow squids slash anything in water but not you without a tropical fish
Does the lava thing also work with water?
when your on bedrock and you could alrwady put lava ina cauldroun and put rails under water
place a DRIP stone ahhahahaaa
Minecraft with goat milk: Milk is milk
Can I have that myth busters! They are so cute!
myth suggestion you can place water in the nether using a cauldron
Idk why this guy have so much subs even tho he has sometimes wrong busts

When you don't watch snapshot video  these vids are entertaining lol keep it up
i play on bedrock it was just part 1 for caves and cillfs :(
I want an army of Axolotls
When you realize that you can’t do glow sighs in 1.17:DUDE NOW I GOTTA REDU THAT VIDEO
Mojang:you can now place rails underwater Bedrock players:I've seen this one before Java players:what do you mean it's a  new feature
Axolotls attack water mobs even if you don't hold a fish. Also the raw iron and gold you showed was actually deepslate ore. Raw iron, gold and copper have a block form but there's no special ore.
Myth:skeleton turn into stray if u put it in powdered snow
I notice they add more achivements too
Myth:if u r in nether and blaze shoots at u   U can burn the fire from powdered snow bucket
Mob die to frozen: so you're saying its fine for players to die?
If you but lava inside a cauldron, and but it in water... it doesn't make into obsidian or do anything!
the snow bucket: "yah it will be useful but doesnt need it for speedrun so its worthless"

This is clickbait all of these aren’t myths they are facts or lies
He didn't know he got the most rare axolotl when he spawned in the green one.....
For the amethyst .............. TELESCOPE
You can dye goats but it’s only in bedrock
I wish you could make amethyst armor and tools
1:42 I thought you milked goats for water not milk???
wait lava cauldrons are new? rails underwater are new?
Mau if you put an axolotl on a lead it will move around like crazy. Its a bug yayayayayaya
Can you dye a sheep with glow sac
Skeleton will turn into stray if they are in powder snow
Man, I really don't like the texture changes to the ores. It's been the same for so long it doesn't feel right to change it. I felt the same when they changed the gravel texture but this is even worse.
if you pour lava in a villager while its in a bed it wont set on fire or even get hurt  if you break blocks under a bed the bed will levatate
You can use Amethysts to craft a spyglass
Why does he say it twice 6:00
Yes,yes we do
You can use the rails thing in 1.16
hey mau there is a difference to myths and game features
The reason that you could stand on snow blocks with the boots is because they were acting like snowshoes!  If you put on a tunic for example, you wouldn’t be able to stand on it.
DUDE MAU IT HAS ALREADY RELEASED
I was about to break my monitor when he said that the dripstone lava cauldron thing didn't work.
Freezing in snow is also not a myth. Its always been a fact.
At least the squids have one use.
Yea your obviously gonna burn underwater like that. Its not intended so they didn't make you not burn.
So does that mean that amethyst is 1000000% USELESS???
Axolotls fighting for you is not a myth. Its always been a fact. (In minecraft, they won't in real life, dont bring your axolotl into battle.)
You can get a amthist crafting table so you can get amthist armor so bro
You have to make a minecraft amethyst crafting table to make them that is what kiingtong did in a UHC
Bedrock players be like: hello are we gonna get the update yet
Him 1.17 is right around the corner PS4 players I do not think you know my power.
