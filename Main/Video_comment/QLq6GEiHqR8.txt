10:59 What the fu-
screw you i am in canada
I now only will see Buchanan like a little kid now
Love how the Americans genuinely thought God would most definitely support kicking out natives and heavily killing or treating them unequal
24:08 it will take 12 weeks for the reply to come back
Did bro really tell the future that the US would want Canada????
37:18 this aged pretty quickly
Imagine having a war because of a pig
Even in oversimplified format, you drew these figures in period accurate clothing that changes as time progresses
Anyone in 2025
Jesus Christ ryman
Ironic considering trump's claim for canada being the 51st state earlier this year XD
1:27 i wonder if this will reprise in the future 🤔
LOL
😭BIDEN PLEASE DONT MAKE ME PAY FOR MY HEALTHCARE
how many times do i have to say this, AMÉRICA IS THE COUNTINENT NOT THE FUCKING US
r/agedlikemilk
I love the ending 😂
I think it's hilarious that half of canada now wants to become US states because of all the leftist policies
7:15 ay yo?
9:05 FACE
All Star reference! 7:58
3:54 "i hear voices all the time" 🤣
Police Officer: Alright sir I’m gonna ask you to please step out of the vehicle. *Drives off* Police Officer: 14:36
27:26 this is just peak visuals
Oh god he saw it coming in 2025
"I didn't say they were WHITE people"
2:36 Made me think of hamilton
Biden did not in fact come. That was an absurdist joke. No capable president of the United States would, of course, suggest invading Canada, and neither would Biden. But…
I love this vid not only for top tier humor, amazing accuracy, and art, but also the Star Wars inspired thumbnail. I love it
cool
It all sounds like a south park episode
Sir, will we get a entire video about the mexican war before 2050?
BUCHANAN
Aged like whine
That ending did not age well
one time my cousin did a project on the war of 1812 instead of saying “the British burned it down” she wrote “the bitch burned it down and now it’s a meme in my family
Ah soo this video is to blame for the breakdown of US/Canada relations.
I am now signing up for Nord VPN, you guys are genius😂
6:52 ad skip ⏭️
36:19 MAKE AMERICA GREAT ITS our manafest destani 51st state god bless america
21:48 “I have a cunning plan, m’lord” ahhhh
4:11
the end jajajajajaaj
7:11
9:06
14:00 is so funny
The killing of a sacred pig?
I think trump and his cabinet took some ideas from the last part of the video.
21:25 Asmongold
Dang what an ending!
The only thing missing here was the Angry Birds.
the ending of this was hilarious 😂
Glubby??
Fuck off if you are thinking to invade Canada
I can swear that the video was 50+ minutes long what the hell happened, am I just horribly misremembering stuff
I think the mid channel cus it says mid two times
The ending speech aged…pretty differently.
Welp, that ending in 2025 has a very different context...
5:05 the Americans should’ve just but asked for a strip of territory in Canada to access the other part of the river just to piss off Britain
If God Intended it, who is the man or woman He spoke to? And are you taking it seriously?
31:03-31:36 animal farm.
Whoa whoa whoa. I didn’t say they were white people  Racist
YEEHAWWWWW, SCREW THOS3 DAMN BRITS AND BRING ME FLOWERS
Looks like Trump did it
37:12
Watching this in oct 2025. I think Trump watched this and got ideas
This did not age well 😭😭
As a Seattle resident in 2025, how I wish they’d gone ahead and drawn the line in the Columbia River.
wow that's so cool
“I didn’t say they were WHITE people” 💀
I like how the voice of reason was a guy so fat he had to be hoisted onto a ship
“Liiiike this video!” Lol
Dude didn’t realize we were legit put into a war (trade war) with Canada by the next president
😂😂😂😂😂 The end lolll
wow, this video turned almost prophetic with trump and all
Looks like some of Canada may become several new US States yet given the tension between East and West.
The last few minutes of this video were oddly prescient, just the wrong president.
In the time it takes for ho. To make a new vid 700m peolple prob get married and have 2 kids I love your content do it worth da wiat
10:23 everyone is talking about the end, while this comedic genius is right here…  “7th Earl of Jizzingham encountered a foul beast in the fields of upper Fartingham”😂😂😂😂
Did anyone realise that he added a part of Mexico that USA hasn’t owned YET
SOOO, You're the one that gave Trump the idea of owning Canada, LMFAO.
I felt the pain in bro's dih at the end
6:54 yapping ends
Why would Harney even join the army if he hated superiors, following orders, and proper military conduct. That sounds like a special breed of stupid to me.
31:10 Yes the pig did actually say that
Im willing to bet that our dear oversimpfied was drunk when he wrote the ending and mabey when he recorded it...
The pig's voice is majestic
Fun fact: The Pig is the only character in oversimplified that has a different voice actor
38:00 well this aged horribly
American
The video did NOT aged well 😭
I actually think the British/Canada won the war of 1812. The main goal for them was to prevent the Americans from taking Canada, which they succeeded in doing
Germany gives away British colonial territory.  50 years later…  *Britain carving up German colonies with France* : Revenge is a bitch.
31:12 hold on was that morgan freeman
oof
i hope canada invades us 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🍁🍁🍁
This reminds me of the Arabian Harb-ul-Basus except that was a cmakr and there was an actual war for 40 frickin years.
he riley loved that pig 🐷
2:13 it doesnt even matter!!
6:27 How dare you call my fav website "shady"
@32:33 excellent half baked reference 😂
18:10 object show fans be like:
If you have misophonia, there is eating around 3:25ish, 17:25ish, 18:30ish, and 30:35ish
37:52 Of this entire video, somehow this was the part that aged the worst.
3:32 Its no one going to talk about the position of that big stick of america?
:3
37:13 IM IN
oooh the ending of this video didn't age well
The only thing he got wrong was 38:10 Biden isn't coming, trump is. Bro revealed the future.
The end is a MASTERPIECE 🇺🇸>🇨🇦 ( Military wise)🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
It’s the right channel
Domestic violence 33:29
Most of the video wasn't even about the pig war.
1:25 you can feel the pain in franklin’s dih 🥀
Do hatfields and mccoys
The All Star reference hits hard.
Love the thumbnail.
The words “this video was made possible by nordvpn” are just ingrained in brain
heheh, Gravity Falls pig
18:38 over a pig?!
Still cant get over how good the Morgan Freeman voice was. 😂
WELL THEY KILLED THE PIG THE PIG THE PIG YOU CAN'T KILL A MANS PIG
37:30 You're forgetting NATO and all the French and British nukes...
38:18 ITS TRUMP GET IT RIGHT FOOL
FUR MHERICA
1:30 and a while later, multiple states in Canada try to flee the leftist Canadian state and join the USA in Trump's second term.  Shows you everyone can change.
Anyone in 2025😅
I LOVE SERIES
32:30  Valid Reaction
See the map when of Vietnam north and south
Entitled caucasians fighting over land that werent theirs to "claim"
7:58  he hittin them bars
3:36 is that a back to the future reference
i love United state of America
Another reason to be added to my "why Americans are so goddamn stupid".
I live right by the San jaun islands and me and my dad go fishing there all the time
THESE VIDEOS NEVER AGE!!!! ⭐
My bad guys.
Love this channel man, hope they teach history in a similar manner in schools
Pickets last charge was almost a few yrs early great plan go get brits to kill you then i can start a war
US'eh was goldd lmaoo
Canada will never become the 51st state I tell you.....
Dude this outro Aged way too well-
Again it’s absurd how history can be so topical
The jews
The war of 1812 or revolutionary war part 2 electric boogaloo
Invading canada and drake for president? This didn't age well
This video is fire
35:11  I like how he gives us the borders of nations that aren’t important
Biden didn’t get a chance to finally accomplish the prophecy of manifest destiny but now Trump’s coming baby and he’s coming with vengeance!!!!!! So get ready Canadians !😂
the death of the Hudson's bay company should be your next video!
Who voiced the pig in this video?
10:23 I love how Oversimplified replicates PERFECTLY how our British MPs constantly shout jokes at each other and the Speaker of the House going “ ORDAH!!! “
Well that ending aged well
Drake as president is crazy work
Ah yes Florida is definitely americas dong
8:48😂😂
4:10 forgot the eagle screech😂
36:04 never gets old
thank u.
32:46 to 30:33 is my favorite
31:03 31:35 I love how the one thing both stories agree on is that the pig could talk and walk on two feet
you know... in 2025 that first minute or two hits different
Removed the flagpole had me dying 😂 36:23
"Then you my friend,should use NordVPN"   "..."  "what the fu-"
37:00 our current president would 100% do this if he ever saw this video
Island
9:27
37:31 trump listening 😂
29:17 best president right here 😅
The end of this video aged well... Sort of
Poor pig and eh… potato, but this is still the most hilarious part of the US history 😂
3:34 America dingle berry 😉
He predicted about Trump's plan to turn Canada into America's 51st state's YET
An American shooting something unarmed. History never changes
True story: Vanhemmat erosivat, 3 lasta muuttivat äidin kanssa Turkuun. Äidillä todetaan aivokasvain ja joutuu leikkaus pöydälle. Äiti selviää, mutta joutuu varhaiselle eläkkeelle. Itse olin tuolloin 10.v keskimmäinen lapsi.  Tämän jälkeen rahaa ei ollut mihinkään ylimääräiseen.  Muistan kun kävimme sosiaalitoimistossa, kun halusin harrastaa salibandiä, mutta rahaa ei ollut edes mailaan. Pääsin harrastamaan Tps junnu tasoon, joka ei maksanut kuin 80e vuodessa.  Nuoruus oli aika perseestä.  Nyt olen 33.v, 2-lasta, vaimo ja omakotitalo.
I'm more concerned about how Harney even got up to that position to begin with.
4:43 they sure love beavers
3:38 “DENSITY”
I’m here in 2025 and Biden did not invade Canada, your prediction oversimplified was wrong😂
War eh?
Oversimplified got everything right except it wouldn’t be Biden who invades Canada.
7:15 *My good sir, there are many objects that are allowed to have spots. But that, my fine fellow, is not one of them. You should probably see a doctor about that.*
THIS VID IS HILARIOUS IDK WHY BUT IT IS
i revisited this video because i wanted to talk to someone about manifest destiny. Sad that Biden isn t coming
"No , the swine is the one I killed . I'm Lyman." -Lyman
0:23 6:54
37:16 watching this in 2025 America like 👀👀
Steamy McSteam Face got me… deep cut. Chef’s kiss.
The ending isn’t as funny anymore…
wow funny
"I didn't say they were WHITE people" *Cheering* Unfortunately that hasn't changed much, even though we're spread from sea to shining sea, the sands and soil are watered with the blood of the massacred
Ñadü
YOU FOUND HER?!
33:29
Thats last bit aged badly. 😬😭
usa get candane
wow i hate america and british more with this vid
The ending had me rolling LMAO 😂
the end of this video didn't age very well
completely American jihadist, honestly i was afraid at the end of the video.
The ending is ironic, yet somehow so prescient.
19:41 since this happened in 1859, and $100 is $3,892.14 today, yes, that is an outrageous price for shooting a pig
33:29 this is what everyone came for lol
So funny how you joked about Canada as part of the U.S. and Biden coming with a vengeance, but Trump actually opened his flaps and fixed his face hole to talk about Canada becoming the 51st state 😂 That aged well.
Eggy bread burned
Your white guilt is off the charts. Pathetic.
Trump will make your wish come true hahahahahhah
This is the most american oversimplified video
3:44  Doesn't that sound like every single colonialism event... also that sounds a lot like a certain German dictator... something about purity...
Biden forgot to invade Canada
Random “all stars” reference😂😂
"Who is it who spoke with god?" "I hear voices All the time"
The fact that this masterpiece of history wouldn’t exist today if they just specified one of the damn straits is wild.
Why did oversimplified lowkey predict Donald trump maybe annexing canada
Limen literally pumps the shotgun to cock it. Its a double barrel the model itself has the hammers you would need to cock back in order to shoot it lol. Honestly this is hilarious me being a gun nerd and all.
7:57
31:35 seeing a character in an oversimplified video actually have legs that move is kinda uncanny
I liked this
With Albert threatening to secede it. sure took 250 years.
Little did he know trump would literally threaten to invade Canada lmao
Did no one else catch the Shrek song reference?
Remember, nothing ever fucking happens.
Biden: America can be defined in 1 word: djbfdbcxjvcdjbvcxfbnyhgf
8:10  one thing I noticed is how the borders changed as time went by tiny but noticeable detail as seen as going from the Spanish to the Mexican empire and Texas
13:59 Same energy as "Firmly grasp it."
7:58 cool rhyme
And ironically, the most likely cause of war between the USA and Canada today is also about a pig.
More like Trump...He wants to make canada the next us terrioty.
lol at 4:13 the B2s
OK now we know where Donald Trump got his idea of taking over Canada, and by the way you owe Britain the cost of one pig plus interest. LOL.
13:30 POV the average oversimplified video
I didn"know you where trump
Sad news Oversimplified, Biden president term is over and he still haven't gotten Canada yet but i have high hope for Trump
very interesting to watch the end of the video in 2025😂
Well, I guess you could say that Charles Griffin was really into "sausage stuffing"
1 John 4:8  Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
Matthew 6:14-15 New International Version 14 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  1 John 4:8  Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
If he changed that last bit from Biden to Trump he borderline predicted the future lol
38:07 “watch your backs, sleep with one eye open tonight, because Donald Trump is coming baby! And this time! He’s coming! WITH THE VENGEANCE!!!” There, fixed it. 😁👍🏻🇺🇸🦅💪🏻
I'm glad these videos have become less silly over the years.
aint no way predicted trump in 2024
People in the 1800s: manifest destiny rules!  Me in 2025: y'all are *(censored)
4:23 please tell me I’m not the only one who sees a lizard offering me some tea?
wait make a video about the mexican american war
Are there any canadians
And potatoes 😂
The war was literally over the shooting range of a random pig😂
you know the beginning of this vid reminds me of a certain terrorist state in the middle east whose name encourages that it is a real nation
3:35 YOU ARE THE GOAT (for using common sense and actually calling things as the so OBVIOUSLY were). "History" somehow turned murder and attempted genocide into "exploration"
5:57 best 6:03
So in a nutshell, a bunch of half Europeans, a bunch of actual Europeans and a bunch of violent now Americans got into a fight over who gets to own land that didn't belong to them in the first place.
ok now we know where trump got is idea of Canada joining to USA
We have a similar situation in the Cambodia-Thai border right now😅
Give us more videos ! ! ! ! ! ! Ahhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
Brits: it said "middle of said channel" so middle channel most likely  Americans: I've got a revolver, shotgun, machete, pocket knife, and a Rocket Launcher, take your option but losing those islands aren't one of 'em. (not a irl threat)
But Canadians are white too
3:33
The dichotomy of American and Canadian criminal law: 17:45
38:11 yeh they both aged well there didn’t they
Nobody died but just a pig , how was it "just a pig" , if so much effect happened after the cause ?
yeeee
16:01 why is the American using AK47? I was expecting AR15
best oversimplified ending 🔥
0:23 6:54
I want an oversimplified video on how Alaska and Hawaii became part of the US
1:25 Roast of the century
We Canadians crossed off so many things on Geneva’s list that they added more :)
Dude. These were the worst movies. Loved them as a kid. But damn.
Does anyone else remember the scene before Lyman shot the pig where the pig stands up and talks to him?
theres an all star version
16:29 The cutest "Oh no" I've ever heard 😢❤
18:18 That sounds like Fishy Mcbookins from SMG4.
11:57 Hol up-
Technically the British lost the pig war because the casualties were 1 for the British and 0 for the Americans that one British casualty was the pig
15:11 dang
The ending didn’t age well lol 😂😭
3:38 lmao a density
1:17 is this where trump got his stupid idea to make Canada become the 51st state?
34:47 Not sure why it took me so long to think to read this
Am I the only one to see a dorky face right under the parallel in Oregon at 4:46 ?
Is it just me or did I hear all star
This ending did not age well😆
Parliament drawn as a bunch of bald guys 😂
15:13 that holdster draw was immaculate
14:31 LMAO
37:25 Donald Trump's prediction...
Nonsense. This is thinly veiled anti-white race hate!!! It is a lie.
37:13 Well... That didn't age well.
deer
3:33 something about that looks wrong
If Joe Biden had attempted conquest of Canada we would have become the Eleventh Province
Trump takin notes at the end
31:07 🤣🤣🤣
🇺🇸4764💂🏼‍♀️vs5746💂🏼‍♀️🇬🇧
🎉 737k
F's in the chat for the Hudson's Bay Company
7:16 ayo
hello..... classmates..... heh..
"our glorious president Drake" 37:50  i swear i died reading that lol thats crazyyyy lolllll
37:08
As a canadian im am upset at the ending
I love your videos
Ahhhhhh so the concept of John Wick emerged from here
8:57 is Graham island apart of Canada or the US
37:49 to 37:53  if only Oversimplified could predict the future…. (it would be funny if Oversimplified did a video on the Rap Civil War for an april fools video)
trump lowkey looks capable of doing that
8:48 - 8:51 That right there is my pettiness lvl
0:48 ayo that is deep racism
I came here expecting a war with explosions, battle cries, and heroic speeches... but instead, I got two grown nations nearly going to war over a pig. A pig. And honestly? It’s the most entertaining thing I’ve watched all week.  OverSimplified has somehow turned petty border drama and passive-aggressive flag planting into cinematic gold. I laughed, I learned, and now I genuinely fear how close we all are to starting World War III over someone’s escaped goat.  10/10 would watch again. If history class had been this good in school, I’d probably be a professor by now.
Rewatching this August 4, 2025, after South Park's season debut. The Kanuks kannot stand Trump. He's a ka-knotheaded ka-nutjob.
that last part did not age well
He really predicted trump and Canada (kinda)
The last minute of this video aged so poorly 🤣🤣🤣
Sounds like Trump watched this episode
Jesus Loves us all so much. He came on earth, died, and rose on the cross for the sins of all humanity so that all may not perish but have eternal life in Him. Repent! Turn from your evil and ungodly ways and turn to Him before it’s too late ⏰‼️ He’s returning soon! ❤️
So when are we going to get that invasion of Canada Trump?
37:16 that rant about the U.S coming for Canada did not age well💀
Bro Im watching this in 2025 and Trump still wants it -What if Trump watched this video?
14:05 this is the most American thing I have ever seen. If only he had a bald eagle on his shoulder and an AK-47 on his back.
how many people are making these vidoes right now
The last part aged like milk
Watching the last 30 seconds is so much funnier in 2025.
I don’t know how I feel about that outro anymore
He predicted it
The 51st state.
Are you diabetic I'm asking cause of the insulin part
“Being American he emerged from his tent with 4 guns and a giant knife” I’m surprised he didn’t emerge with a full ass tank
all because of a missclick
Man that ending aged like rotten milk
I love history especially when oversimplified does it
This video aged well....
3:50 "i thought it was Sharon's cat" and "I hear voices all the time" are my 2 favorite sentences outta that discussion
The end - absolute cinema
the colombia river would've been a fine ass border
Can you make 1812 war please 🙏
Do not show trump the end of the video 😭🙏
Well this ending aged poorly
I love it. This is the best video you ever made. I love it I am Dara
Racist garbage
OS predicted the US trying to buy Canada
charles griffin cant even give someone 80 bucks and he be asking for $100, thats kinda funny ig lol
this guys so fucking funny i love it
37:13 well this aged well
Being an American he came out with 4 pistols and a big knife!! Classic
Yeah that outro.
HARNEY, YOU BLITHERING IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Outro aged like fine wine
The jokes about America invading Canada have really aged well.
I love that this video not only talks about the Pig War but also about the American westward expansion, and manifest destiny, and everything prior to the Civil War. Great Job  5 thumbs up 👍👍👍👍👍
Oversimplified underestimated cute baby pigs who poop in their underpants and roll in mud
They don’t stop coming and they don’t stop coming 7:59
man that entire ending aged both horribly and beautifully
Morale of the story- Straight lines help everything.
11:57 WHAT
7:33 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:19 uhh… WHAT
4:16 BRUH
That ending aged weird. We love you Canada. See you in three and a half years.
LOL the last part.. Has it aged well or not?
Funny how no one actually has a picture of Lyman Cutler… Well, not his face that is.
7:57 You're an All Star 😎
The ending did not age well
"Invading Canada"? "president Drake"? Oversimplified, you KNEW it would age horribly and I applaud you for your bravery
yall anyone notice a flag of russia under americas fglag in the bigning!!
(brits) BHUCANAN!! (presedent) AAAAHHHHH!!! *crying like a girl* bruh
THE AMERICANS NEALY STARTED A WAR OVER POTATOES AND A PIG HOW DUMB WERE THEY
i like that he spent 38 minutes on a war that never happened
América 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 7:25 7:31 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 América🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 again 16:29 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 16:34
“But the Americans keep coming, and they don’t stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. It didn’t make sense to share Oregon, when they outnumbered the brits; six to one” -I need a full version.
7:31-16:35 bro thinks he's darth vader lol🤣!
The end of the video aged like milk tbh lmao
33:21 my favorite part
So nice videooo
Glad to see that his videos still draw in new viewers or repeating viewers! Been watching for years now, still eagerly awaiting the next video 😢
That ending aged so, so incredibly well
5:56 what the FU-
29:34 Harney calling the British "big meanies with coal for hearts" is touchingly endearing to me. I wish people would use such metaphors more often.
This aged well
that ending definitely aged for both canadians and americans.  hoooo boy. as a canadian, who wants to get the popcorn and watch the chaos with meeee??? anyone?
@Five-g4p @Alex-x6z2b
666:666
I love how he talks about invading Canada ironicly, and now trump is serious about it.
The second strait 9:44
The second
i dont think drake should be our leader i say over simp should
Hey here in 2025 that drake line did not age well
Saying Drake as the president did not age well
Well, this didn't age well.
Err you may want to edit the last bit of this in light of current geo political tensions. It's a little less funny now lol.
26:24 this is Israeli citizen when Israeli army attacking on Gaza. You can see the pattern among these, they are all same, hungry for money and power, but they only blame Muslim.
So that’s why America support Israel
wallahi biden didnt do jack all
38:10 that did not age well
38:19  with trump in office  This sged basad 😂
trump is coming baby
Watching this video on the Fourth of July and it's just perfect
3:38 it's my density. Me too man
11:05 THEY'RE SPANISH 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸 **Spanish Anthem intensifies**
4:05 — the paramount of the whole video
I would like to see what you could do with Alexander the great
Trump thought your conclusion was serious. :(
Lol ooooh, that ending joke hits a bit different now.
Oof that ending joke has... Not ages well in 2025
YEEEEEEEEEEE-HAWWWWWWW
Can you do the War of 1812?
6:00 yes😊
Well well well, 3 years later and seems like the invasion of Canada part actually is pretty funny huh
Smash mouth reference... love it
6:53 skip ad 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53 6:53
This has to be a meme 33:29
28:10 Yooooo😏😈
Yeah sorry I don’t think Biden will be invading Canada
Ho no😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Text you copy will automatically show here😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉Text you copy will automatically show here
Morgan Freeman as a pig was not on my history bingo card
3:52 I really wanna know what they are murmuring. I think I can hear "Billy" and "cat" but idk my English is not very good
I think oversimplified predicted what would happen right after Biden left.
And to think there was a time when the British used to have a full on court trial for any farm animal which happened to injure or kill a human. Public Defender appointed and everything. Weird shit.
2:50 hey look , a returning character  !
Oh that that whole Biden thing he’s not in office anymore. Kind of sad for us gays though
Trump should see this  video to realise who the real immigrants are.
President Polk really poked his nose in many businesses. Roosevelt would hate him.
The more I read History, the more I understand why there are no asses in America ('cause America itself is one).
This oversimplified guy isn't even taking us seriously，make some video about Chinese modern history:)
The end of this video did NOT age well at all lmao
7:15 uh.....
i guess Trump saw this and said why not Canada should surely become the 51st  state of the United States of America
21:32
I am sure this war wouldn't cause anyone to DIE!   (Popular phrase)
It would been worst than death of frank fern and
3:34 Florida…
37:08 This hits differently in 2025. Just wait for America's 250th birthday. In 1776, America came to power, and in 2026, America will claim all of North America.
9:01 I think this channel (the fuca straight) was the intended channel for the treaty
Remember when invading Canada was a joke?
Trump 100% watched this video and you can't convince me otherwise.
President drake didn't age well.
29:09 weird because breckenridge was pro-secession
7:58 not him making a history version of all star
14:36 feels like a markiplier bit
No one show this to trump, he’ll get ideas.
Well that last minute aged well
I think Trumped watched the part on invading canada
The last minute of this video aged well into 2025
The ending aged like fine wine
"I always hear voices".
37:15 well... that didn't aged well... like at all... 😂
That ending did not age well
Bro really hates canada sooo bad
1:20 Canada's curves have never been more of actually than today 😅
37:53 This aged poorly. You mean our Glorious President Kendrick Lamar
37:25 Canada, First French, Then British and Now, AMERICAN!
Oversimplified is teaching way better than actual classrooms
So, that ending has aged like only the finest of old milk.
باشه😂
I think DJT may have recently seen this!
5:56 the cut away made me laugh so hard  Along with this face at 14:00
1:29 A tradition that carries on to today!
I think Trump might of watched this.
Biden coming to fall down stairs buddy
🐷
Biben isn't 😂
26:49
Best episode, hands down!
I just now realized that spuddy has sonic's shoes
Save 23:18
So this is where Trump got his Canada plan..
He just doesn't want to show off his teeth, unlike the other regiment, they confidently showing their teeth
3 years later, I think this is still my favorite Oversimplified
Most of the perpetrators were involved with the confederacy later and many of them turned on America. They were attempting to start a war with England. They were trying to do that so that they could start the Civil War early and crush America between the British on the north and the Confederate on the south. The plan was to pincer America and give it back to the English. The confederates were famously on the side of the British, and the British were famously on the side of the Confederates. This shows me that the Civil War was planned even before Lincoln became president. This shows me that the British were probably involved in instigating the civil war.
7:15 spotted WHAT???
omg the end 🤣
The alarm sound sounded like the vault from a vr game call  ghost of tabor
00:15 was just having a sleep disorder due to a lack of cute boys to snuggle with  though you aren’t cute i’d get one
Given the current Trade war and allegations on Drake, that ending did not age well
37:22 that one didn’t age quite so well… 😮
0:37
I found some Hudson Bay silver crosses from this period. I still have one with beads. It’s wicked
Can you talk about poland
i just watched this video and the whole US invading canada joke is so relevant lol
10:14 that’s crazy
🙄😂
Me in 2021: Ha, the invasion of Canada could never be thought of or even happen, how dumb.  Trump in 2025: We'll see about that
"i heard it was Shermans cat " is wild
37:20 I actually got goosebumps from this speech 😂
LOL😂 rewatching this 3 years later and realizing bro predicted the current timeline at the end☠️
Nooooooooo
This video helped me study for my history test I love oversimplified
thats the most threatening pig ive ever seen
33:29 was so funny
Did anyone else catch that Smash mouth reference at eight minutes in?
"what the f-" that got me dying 💀😂
I love how oversimplified almost predicted Canada and thr US in 2025
the conclusion age like milk
the ending aged to perfection
i cant lie the ending started to worry me untill i realized this video is 3 years old  *phew* how things have changed
38:11 think he means trump 😂😂
Straight line? Straight line.  😅
Whelp, that ending soured like milk all of a sudden...
5:10 I don't see how that's a fair compromise, unless the UK intended to make the border swoop up to the head of the river, why should it swoop down? The precedent was straight line so the US pushing for that consistency was fair and justified.
19:25  me when griff gets a hypercharge 😂😂
“So who spoke to God again” “I don’t know Sharon’s cat”  😂😂😂😂
Aged like wine
16:00 ak-47? THAT'S NOT AMERICA!!!
Can we get OverSimplified: Hypotheticals. And it’s just chaos, like the speech at the end.
3 years later he predicted trumps idea
37:16 I know someone who watched this video 😭😂 happy 2025 everyone
Murder can only be done by a human on a human.
Watching this in 2025… the end hits different
I like that the ending isn't a joke anymore. Welcome to 2025.
I like how we went from an average Elementary School/Middle School/Early High Achool history teacher to an absolute hell-bent pro-war, patriotic American psychopath.
The ending of the video didn’t age very well lmao
Is anyone going to talk about how the pig talked a lot like Morgan freeman
7:56 Smash Mouth reference.
I love how no character has feet, except for the pig.
38:12 switch biden for trump and you got 2025
1:28 this aged well
18:36 I'm genuinely wondering why that guy is laughing so hard.
38:11 this is funny because this is the opposite of what Joe Biden would do but this is exactly what our current president, Donald Trump, wants to do.
That ending didn’t age well
21:28 Nah banana phone and iron phone
1:30 this reminds me of a certain someone...
3:33 THAT IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO PUT LEGS OVERSIMPLIFIED, FLORIDA LOOKIN A LITTLE WEIRD
Kentucky Good Ole boys patsy a swine for rolling thunder barbecue JUNE & JOHN.
Oh Biden came with a vengeance alright.
33:29
Three years later and oversimplified got it right only with Trump lol 😂 JK!
33:30
The ending was all fun and games... but it got serious 2025
Donald Trump: Oh Canada I've been needing to tell you this! Canada: And what is it? Donald Trump: Will you become the 51st state? Canada: Fuck naw! Donald Trump: But your curves are voluptuous! Canada: You should take care of yours!
This video has aged like fine wine
37:09  bro predicted the future 💀
love how the ending aged so well dont let trump see this he'll start saying Manefest Destiny
4:12 “Lets make the world a better place” 💀
WTF man!! WTF!!,!,!
Well the US -CANADA is happening 😂😂😂😂
37:11 aged like milk
N
That was the greatest outro ever
If only that little rant at the end was still a joke.
This did not age well
The joke of occupying Canada now did not age well
9:41 all the way left
The ending of the Video don't aged well: it's not Biden threatening to invade Canada but Trump
the end has not aged well
7:58 I sense a beat in here
"Why can't we invade Canada" - Donad Trump
1:16 When fascination passes its limit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trump loved this video
that trump not biden
12:53 12:54
4:00 i mean... Genesis 1:28 NKJV [28] Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
Is this the same pickett from pickett's charge?
✝✝✝ 19:34
at the end you became that filfhy trump guy that sould not be president
Bro watching the ending in 2025 is quite the foreshadowing 😂 holy shit
god that canada rant aged poorly
Quick video idea make a video on the Holocaust
That ending sure didn't age well, eh?
Great video - watching it in 2025, and I am now convinced that this channel is responsible for giving Trump ideas about Canada. Your channel may be the only history lessons he can understand!
That ending didn't age so well now did it.
This aged well.
5:57 best part
23:15 I wonder if the Oversimplified of inside 20 years will do a video like this putting certain guy in the same light...
That ending got me hard.
nice
1:24 Benjamin curves😭
Very nice. 😂😂
republicans saw that ending segment and took it seriously
STOP THE WAY WE ARE ABOUT TO DECLARE WAR ON CANADA😭😭😭😭
Ah yes, the beaver buisness 😂😂.
‘MURICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man the US invasio  is happening. You made a very good prediction.
18:17 sounded like a character from a cartoon I used to watch as a kid
This is where trump got the idea
Now we take Canada, they clearly need our defense budget
This and serious history channels really should be shown to middle school kids there that good. Never been interested in history before these channels
Man your commentary is legendary lmfao...informative and funny. U don't  see that in videos very often
ahhh, so this is where trump got his 51st state idea.
oh yea, the ending by 2025 has aged very well
The ending bit of this video has aged fairly poorly
37.16 Easy there Donald Trump
37:50 aged like milk, unfortunately.
3:30  israel be like
Never thought I’d hear about Biden comin’ with a vengeance 😂
Nice
nice 11:57
2025 and murica is waging war over a pig in the oval office. history is like poetry; it rhymes.
Sorry, spotted WHAT?!?!
4:10 teacher: okay so discuss your questions with your group
10:22 has to be one of OS's best scenes, i lose it every time 🤣
This hits different in 2025. We're in conflict again because of a much less attractive pig.
Wow on 2025 the last minutes hit a whole lot differently
imagine you are oversimplified and becoming president of USA
The basics of all jokes straight line straight line
Trump got ideas because of you
1:27 Too real
Who's here now because of the news? Haha.
The bidens coming thing at the end would of been MUCH funnyier today with trump after everything that has gone down since this videos release
(Someone who’s from Vancouver.) the fort is actually about to be 200 years old this year.
Aged like fermented fruit
The illustration for Fort Vancouver are pretty accurate, that’s exactly what it looks like haha.
he predicted the future trump plan to invade canada
2025 weeps towards the final xD
I now blame Oversimplified for giving Trump the idea to Invade Canada. Like bruh, the f@
31:11  this why germany, russia and uk sees America like that
that last bit aged like milk
The ending of this video has aged… badly 38:15
I watched this sitting at a campsite on San Juan Island wondering what this pig war was about. Wild.
The ending aged like milk
37:13 aged like fine wine
7:54 ahh yes, where history is made
fuck me i just lost the alst comment bc the video refreshed shit
President Trump watched this video and took the Canada comments a bit too seriously
So for some spoilers...Biden didn't invade Canada for vengeance but maybe Trump would do it...xoxo
ok  quick question who think harrney is an idiot cuz i do
lyman didnt even mean for the war to start lol
I thought that ending was supposed to be a joke...
Now in 2025 your prophecy is about to come true
The ending aged like milk
Probably one of the funniest parts of the video 33:21
37:15 This didn't age well
37:10 watching this after trumps reelection feels different
“more about your own curve” is wild twin
Well the end aged poorly with the whole 51st state controversy 😭😭
Why do Americans act like we're the ONLY ones to EVER take over land? It's weird...stop it
This ending didn't aged well
Oversimplified valid crashout
Man, the ending of this video did not age well
The islands are American
Well that ending aged well
I think trump watched the end lol
“What the f-“ -random American nearby cabin
31:01 I WAS DEAD LOL!!! 🤣🤣☠
37:15 did not age very well... 😂
The craziest thing? Because of Trump, the whole last skit almost seems like he had a premonition of some kind.
2021: What a funny joke! 2025: That joke isn’t funny anymore
38:12 this is aging well
Try do South African history
33:24 to 33:35 is insanely comedically funny
Porky
You remember the guy with the potatoes, yeah, I think I oversimplified made it seem like he was from Idaho.
I wonder if a certain cheeto-colored idiot watched the end of this and claimed the idea was his
This ending almost aged perfectly. Just one president off
Who’s watching in 2025 😢
Wait, our first oversimplified character that has an actual walking animation is a gangster pig?
GENGHIS KHAN PLEASE
who is wacthing this in 2025 i am
1634 That’s just Texans’s
Well... that ending certainly has a different tone in 2025 😅
This canadian invasion joke has aged like milk
19:13 - 19:23 Tchaikovsky «Waltz of the Flowers»
I like how he showed the animals getting sad when the Americans destroyed the forests
you know ill just fuckin quote this but with trump
Whilst not completely factual, it is much more enjoyable and factual than MrSpherical's take on The Pig War
Too much comedy to understand what is actually real
As a Canadian,all I can say is Fucking bring it
Finally, let’s make Canada the 51st state! Let’s make it happen! CA51! Instead of Biden tho, we’ll send Trump!
37:15 this aged so poorly
2:50 That land was the usa bought was 9 years before(almost) the war of 1812
Hey,HONG KONG ISN'T A County
The ending has aged like milk
The ending did not age well 😂
Trump has seen this.
Speech at the end is not funny anymore…
15:50
eesh, 3 yrs later the irony of the ending of this video.
0:50 💀💀💀
I thought when he said “whatcom” county he was mispronouncing Wahkiakum County, and now that I say both out loud I feel like “whatcom” is just a white misinterpretation of the native word Wahkiakum.
Why are the sections named after torture methods?
Well that ending aged well.
Omg, the end of your video accurately predicts the next administrations foreign relations policy with Canada 3 years early!
12:04 - Charles Griffin, you damn fool! That's Kitchener Leslie's girlfriend!
7:57 But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hoped on thier wagon's and hit the ground running didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon when they outnumber the brits more than 6 - 1. But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hoped on thier wagon's and hit the ground running didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon when they outnumber the brits more than 6 - 1. But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hoped on thier wagon's and hit the ground running didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon when they outnumber the brits more than 6 - 1
👇♥️ hopped on their waggons and just started running😂
Who tf shared this video with donald? 💀
the treaty  states the middle of the channel so why not the middle
Why are so much Americans idiots? Obviously, not everyone, but still so fkn much. Ether u guys are smart, normal or like next lvl dumb. (Like: lvl.99++ - Stupid-/Retardness)   (Somehow you need in worldwide politics, sadly the very same...) Do you need a genetic or any psychical disability to become a politican?  What If we start a world wide "Internet-Party" with a single Chairman in every land where we still can do such a thing. Maybe so we can become one Nation:"Earth" with the old nations around. But well here I wanted to see If enough ppl would folllow such a thing. What do you guys think !  1. Rule: Everybody is always honest.
"One united nation, under the leadership of our glorious president, DRAKE!" -Oversimplified 2021
I love oversimplified
The ending of this video hits different now lmao.
12:20 "Roll around in that cow crap for yes"  So there were cows!!
3:53 the guy saying “I hear voices all the time” is under appreciated
Well that with Canada being invaded by the USA didn‘t age so well huh?
Damn, that Ending aged poorly...
This really really didn’t age well
Hey oversimplified, the end of this video does not age well. And honestly it's a little provoking. Just saying maybe cut or change the ending. Might be a good idea, I can't tell you what to do it's your video. But just a suggestion
9:37 how about they spit the island in half? (In a straight line going south, of course) 😅  Or, preferably, they could split it down the middle channel 😊
I think Trump watched the last minute of this video
3 years later, the USA are more annoying then ever...
This aged so much better than anyone could have imagined
As someone in Oregon, we were taught it was because they were hot headed idiots.
He was kidding at the end guys. HE WAS KIDDING!!! I hope.
When oversimplified doesn’t post 5:56 BTW I KNOW ANIMARION TAKES AWHILE THSI US JUST A JOKE KEEP DOING WHAT YOUR DOING OVERSIMPLIFIED ❤
Was I the only one who saw he said it is my density instead of destiny
Remember when “invading Canada” would’ve be diabolical when this was made? Damn how time has changed…
this didn't age well...
6:52 Sponser skip😊
Still one of my favorite Oversimplified videos intros ever. So sad, but so funny
300 years later, The British colonists (Canadians) and the Americans are still fighting.
Watching this in 2025 when trump wants to make Canada the 51st state is hilarious
Ad skip 6:55
General Harney was the embodiment of American
28:10 got literally perfect ad timing   “As to wether or not it’s true, I like to believe that IN NINETEEN-EIGHTY  THERE WAS THE DISCOVERY OF A LOST TEMPLE-“
0:48 Those people are racist 😂
Well oversimplified that dream of invading Canada could come true in real life with Donald Trump today so oversimplify you basically foreshadow what could happen
the amercians were so wrong lol
that canada stuff aged well didnt it
that ending aged well..... soooo can you end one of your videos with me getting one million billion trillion dollars *pinkeye to corner of mouth*
37:15 bro listened to the voices💀
Wow...I remember seeing how you ended this video when it first came out, but it definitely feels darker and more real now...
Theres a something in the american land its a human
20:50 bro thinks he is the main character in top gun
Well with Trump on office this ending aged badly 🤣😂🤣🤣
Make Alaska part of the continental United states
oversimplified predicted it wth
38:08 this aged like milk
the greatest american prophet...
37:05 this aged brilliantly
The end of the video was just a HILARIOUS prediction 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man, this ending aged like pig milk
10:26
The ending to this video is a little less funny under the current political situation.
Oversimplified can i marry you? [Im a Male]
The ending has not aged that well... considering the conversations of the president.
Do a face reveal!
That Canada joke did not age well.
Wait what! This was three years ago and the ending predicted the renewed US aggression to Canada that are happening right now.
Poor guy just wanted to live happily with his pig
Typical Americans thinking they’re better than everyone and being pathetic (not saying all are like that)
in 4:10 brutalyty struckt
Yo can we all give a shout out to Napoleon Bonaparte for selling us (The USA) the Louisiana Territory, just thank you so much man, you really where a great Frenchman (French Emperor)
Trump watched this
We have the allies -Canada
7:14 AYO WTF  WHY IS BRO SAYING THAT???
3:31 America became the real Big-Back
Hilarious and educational 🤠👍 darn Glubby Amuricans
*2026
32:09 him saying that makes it sound even more ridiculous
I’m from the future. This video definitely was watched by Trump, who became President again and wants to conquer Canada (and Greenland and Panama).
I mean, mate he didn't invade them, he just taxed them
"It's my DENSITY", NOT DESTINY(check it actually says that)
The end didnt age well ;)
S THIS is where Trump got his ideals from... you dirty dirty youtuber...
1 all day
1:32 oh boy trump is thinking about it
The end of the video about invading canada has aged great for 2025.
The ending has aged like moldy cheese…
37:10 WELP
Did not age well at end
Trump must have seen the ending to this old video and not understood the concept of a "joke". All of this, the saber rattling, the tariffs, the global economic crash, *your* fault.  Y U DO DIS?
You predicted trumps dream 🎉🎉🎉
38:00 Me in US in 2025 thinking that OverSimplified might be a Simpsons producer. (Who knew that Donald Trump would talk about invading Canada)  (Edit: I am not saying that Trump is bad, I am neutral in politics and I am not trying to make anybody mad.)
one thousand three hundred and.. SIXTY NINE?!
This hits different in 2025
Well, and there is 2025… 😅
38:05 This aged well
War. War never changes. *oink* *oink*
I bet this is Dondald Trump's favorite Oversimplified video.
This is 3 years old and more meaningful now than when you wrote it.
haha that invading Canada joke at the end, hits a little to close to home these days.
The second ones happening right now. More of a trade war buts still
38:13 no he isn’t
Darth piggyieus
7:57 bro is sptting bars from all star
watching the end of this in 2025 might be the funniest thing I have ever seen
Donald Trump must have watched this video and been inspired.
1:31 "Many in America suggested that, one day the Canadian colonies should become a part of the United States. In response, Britain suggested that many in America should shut the hell up."  History repeats itself
4:10-4:16 your average call of duty lobby
Donald Trump watched this video and took the last part way too seriously
Seems like a certain very stable genius got inspired a little too much by the last part
did mabel accidentally send waddles to canada
Bro talking shit ab manifest destiny. We made this place what it is. Freedom 🦅
9:19 yu oh
7:15 WTF what the heck?
5:57 oh well lol lol lol lol lol😂
0:17 I really want one too bad I’m 3 years late
1:26 that is an amazing roast best roast ever
Spuddy’s shoes looks like sonics
This aged horribly bad :(
Oversimplified do roman empire Julius Caesar pls🎉
16:29 lmao
Just change Biden to Trump at 38:12 and this video is now historically accurate.
How ironic the end was of todays conflict
That pig sounds like Morgan freeman
But honestly kinda mad to hear 😡
Well the last part was true kinda
This aged amazingly or horribly, I’m not sure which
The last 2 minutes of this episode aged like a fine wine... Watch your back Canada (looking at you too Greenland) Trump is coming for you 😂
That ending aged well
Crazy how the outro aged
I think a certain someone took the ending too literally.
alright, which one of you bozos showed this video to Trump or Elon?
This video did NOT age well 😭😭😭😭
I think I know who's going to invade Canada and it's not Joe Biden is Donald Trump
This did not age well
that last part of the video aged like milk with piss in it
That last bit aging kinda poorly
bro that ending joke aged like fucken' *milk* 🤣🤣
The ending bit was funny and almost got accurate.
Bro had that 1800's Macarthur energy.
who else is watching this video in 2025 with Trump menacing to make Canada the 54 state
well this didnt aged well xd with Trump
yeah... that comment about the US invading canada did not age well.
37:47 2022 Oversimplified under Biden: like that’ll ever happen, right? 😊 2025 under Trump:… 😐 2022 Oversimplified under Biden:… right? 😥
14:55 13:10 😂😂
The ending aged poorly 😅 The insulin jab aged really well though since trump made thoose prices skyrocket 😂
The end of this video hasn't aged well...
Canada RULES up yours, yank
that thing about america invading canada aged interestingly
The McDonald's is just perfect!
Ironic, at the end. 3+ years later. Canada being brought into the fold of the United States has been brought up. I mean, Canadians, US isn't that bad. You can actually own a tank and guns and live out in the woods. Just have to make sure you pay your taxes or the IRS won't send a drone strike to take out your cabin and bill you for it.
Wow.  The end of this aged....idk if it aged like fine wine or like milk.  But it did something.
I don't think that the native Americans being white would have stopped us
Trump saw the ending of this video about taking over Canada and took it to heart
Oversimplified, if you like covering cooky and weird wars such as this and War of the Bucket, here's a couple suggestions: The Cod War War of the Stray Dog (Greco-Bulgarian border conflict)
1:25
For the same reason we don't invade Mexico again: they ain't got s***!
1:27 i guess thing never change
Ending aged poorly lmao
Nostalgia. I remember the day this video came out exactly 😂🔥🔥 thank u Mr oversimplified
Gets a whole different meaning in 2025 eh? with trump an all?
38:00 This aged really well XD
And now trump wants Canada🤣🤣 you foretold the future from the past
37:14 is literally the Apollo’s gift of prophecy meme. It’s hilariously, sadly ironic.
Bro, this ending hits different in 2025
Trump really saw the end and thought YES but I’m in charge
Funny watch this in 2025
27:26 the map doesn't change at all
Harney Pmo istg 🥀
Well... Revisited after some time to watch this video again... And well... I guess you have to make an update for the ending of this video... ;)
Good thing general Scott’s gout wasn’t acting up
13:56 hey I'm making you a constable put on this badge. AHHHHHHGHHHH
Uh oh
The history of American arrogance lol
Welcome to 2025. That ending is now truly fucked up.
Well that ending no longer sounds like a joke anymore. Only had the president wrong.
I love your videos Man I love studying history and I like your perception on things only one question....   At the end of the video did you give Trump the idea to try to annex Canada? 😂 LOL
*silence*        “Strait line?” “Strait line.”
Well this was prophetic.
Yeah, no, Joe doesn't have enough bulbs upstairs to pull that off. Dondon has a blown fuse and is definitely gonna try.
It’s crazy bc Trump is wanting to take Canada now
Do a face reveal
Trump watched this video
Honestly this whole video is surreal. Like yeah there is the aged ending but also the President keeps parroting this whole line of "the line is artificial and know one knows how it came to be" yet here we are
This opening is more hilarious in 2025! 52nd State Gay North Dakota!
ending really didn't age well considering the fascist in office
Re-watching the end part of this video in 2025...
38:11 Wrong president. 😂
Top three most annoying countries  1 USA 2UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FREEDOM LAND
❤🎉❤😂🎉😂😂😂🎉😂😂😂😂❤
38:05 haha wtf. One president off though
You know, the gag at the end about conquering canada was genuinely really funny when this was uploaded.  Emphasis on was, parody is dead and buried I swear.
This ending aged like milk,
I know I've already commented bu the sentiment at the end of the vid has been bothering me for a long time. For my entire life Ive always had americans "joking" about how one day they would take us over. Ive always taken it seriously and with this 51st state BS going on its proven what Ive always known. America is not our friend and may not be for another 50 years even if no invasion takes place because there is always the chance some strongman wannabe will try to pick this up again. Im angry, dusgusted and exhasted by all of this. We are a fiercly independent people will never except american rule no mater what it costs us. The American century is over because of the appathy of the American people, the greed of the republicans to chose someone whose coat tails they think they can ride and the incompatance of the democrats to support such a weak cantidate and only takeing half measures while going after Trump. We will never surender even if our government falls
37:08 this didn't age well
2025: "Could the USA invade Canada?" ...Think about it... Why NOT?
How badly did the end of this video age…
Trump is inspired by this video 😂
37:00 uh-oh...
Man this aged well, it's nice to know this guy predicted a whole war,
This ending aged like milk XD
Watching this in March 2025... this ending is scary!
watching this video in march 2025....glups
I guess somebody from Trump's administration was watching this
It's weird catching this video in March 2025, those bastards have been after our land the whole time!
37:18 Well this has aged nicely...
I’m ngl I watch u when im eating
Listening to that last bit in 2025 is a slightly different experience
1:27 bro was ahead of his time 💀💀💀💀
What the f- So perfect 5:56
An imbicle, all mater no mind , an arrogant humbug and laughing stock want to become the president of US? Well in 2025 it was success.
37:14 trump must have only watched this part of the video
How does this video have 34 MILLION VIEWS?! That is INSANE. I LOVE IT.
This aged like fine wine 💀
29:18 buchanan
Well, that ending didn't age well lol
Well, this aged well /sarcastic
typical american so hot headed that doesent know what the concecounces could be but of cours not right
37:16 heinsieght is 2025
37:00 didn’t age well
I wonder how he feels about all that America taking over Canada rhetoric now?😂
Watching this in 2025 and kind of scared the ending can still be a reality rn 🤣
Do an update for 2025. And don’t forget Point Roberts.
The end has not aged well.
Racism lore be like: 0:36
Watching this vid in 2025 that last minute came on and I'm like 👀
watching this vidoe now again.. well yes u could invade canada. LOL
7:58 that song is back in my head.
The end of this video aged very poorly, lmfao
This has to be the best ending to a video i have ever seen
@OverSimplified I think trump saw this video.... and you are ground zero....
USA claiming Canada predictions and I'm here in 2025
37:13 this aged like fine wine 💀
Welp... this aged well
The ending bit in early 2025 💀
Wow that comment never held so much weight till now huh 51st?
I'm not going to lie the white jokes or woke jokes are pretty obnoxious haha. One video it was so over the top I couldn't discern if it was just being goofy or if it's actually a thing. I also don't know when the joke ends and the history begins. So if you're looking for constructive criticism, I'd say just dial it back a little bit. I like history because I don't t have to hear wokeisms or rhetoric haha I just like history.
I love watching this in 2025. The ending hits different
the end joke didnt age well
Such an emotional roller coaster 😂 and historically very informative
That ending did not age well lol
'Member when the idea of U.S. invading Canada was a funny joke?
BBBBBAAAAA
Either play ball or be conquered, America!❤
Sooo umm is Canada going to become part of the United States or…?
Oh boy, that last segment talking about "Could it perhaps still invade Canada?" aged HORRIBLY
The ending aged so damn horribly.
The drake as president joke didn’t age well😂
watching this during the tariff war
37:15 whoa there donny tr*mp, calm down
37:18 - 38:20 😆
37:11 it’s 2025, an this feels different today
Trump want to invade Canada in 2025 as a matter of fact
I like how this is also the war of 1812 oversimplified.
This ending hits real different in 2025
37:07 + Dude........uncool
When giving America arms and legs Florida kinda looks like a pi**s
This aged well 😂
31:47 gangster, pig
Man, the last 3 minutes aged rather poorly in recent times...
14:30 best part
Funny thing is the last rant might happen soon
Trump must have watched this video!
Dude is nearly as MAGA as Trump. But, I guess it makes sense that Oversimplified would be an American war monger.
Well this aged poorly
Yeah, sure , it was gunna be Biden. You know, the creep who sniffs little girls hair, and doesn't know where he is 2/3s of the time...
This aged so well!
Next video American -Canadian war 😂😂😂
It's 2025, and I need a sequel of the US v. Canada fight titled Dumbest Trade War.
Bring back manifest destiny  We didn’t steal anything, we conquered  And we’re not sorry And we’ll do it again
37:11 ☕🗿🇺🇲
Oooh, that ending did not age well...
Uhm this hits a little different now.
Bidens coming just rings so different now after everything we now know haha
7:15 7:32 (16:29 ) 16:37 9:19 13:28
General Winfield Scott was the first three-star general in American History since George Washington. The next three-star general after him was George McClellan, and then, Ulysses S. Grant became the second man to hold the rank of General of the Army. Here are the nine men who held that rank: 1. George Washington (pothumously, 1865) 2. Ulysses S. Grant (1865-1869) 3. William T. Sherman (1869-1885) 4. Philip H. Sheridan (1885-1888) 5. John J. Pershing (1917-1941) 6. George C. Marshall (1941-1947) 7. Dwight D. Eisenhower (1942-1953) 8. Douglas MacArthur (1942-1950) 9. Omar Bradley (1950-1981)
I’m guessing the people in Washington and Oregon wish they were part of Canada right now.
I love that this entire situation was started by a guy who took issue with an animal, WHOSE NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH GLUTTONY, eating his unprotected crops. An animal, who does not understand property law or rights of ownership. Eating food. That it found. On the ground. Unprotected. Obviously cause for killing someone else's pig and setting in motion a string of events that nearly became an all out war.
1:27 this aged like milk in 2025 with our clown of a president
Yeah that Canada Invasion joke didn't age well did it
This ending hits real different in 2025. Love your videos, just found it hilarious in that way too dark millennial way.
Trump watched this probably.
The ending to this video has not aged well
If you can't keep your own land, that's a skill issue pure and simple.
22:16 A letter is going through Panama channel (nonexistent at the time)
Remember when invading Canada was an absurd joke? Yeah...
This video has aged well. 😂
That ending did NOT age well
i need to get my teachers on this sh
Talk about Canada more I demand it!! 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
He had no idea how right he was when he thought that America could invade Canada. The possibility that President Trump does invade Canada is very real. Are you perhaps a prophet?
9:05 it says in the center of the channel meaning it goes through the middle one
You know the end of the video aged surprisingly bad
37:08 its funny to hear it now😂
I enjoy the laughter of the Hawaiian shepherd at 18:32.  It’s like he knew what was going to happen.
I have the utmost respect for removing the flag pole.
Trump approves this video
The ending aged like milk
U better stop threatening my country Canada is the best 🇨🇦
The ending of this video hits different in 2025 lol
The ending no longer feels funny anymore. It just feels awful that something so ridiculous is verging on becoming reality.
oh boy the ending
in light of recent events bring back manifest destiny lol
7:57- 8:04 Peak music
37:21 he knew something
I like how 200 years ago this actually happend and we are making fun of it
God I love watching some oversimplified I can’t wait for a new videos in 2025
Anybody notices how the number of sheep was exactly 37 squared.
one of your best videos
I love being Canadian. Our maple syrup is sooooooooooooooooooo good
Well the ending has not aged well...
This hits different now...
37:08 this aged very well
When trump said that stuff about canada I KNEW I had to come back to look at the comments and the ending of this video 😂😂
this aged perfectly 😂
This manifest Destiny didn't age well lmao
1:22 Joke's on you lot. Ben was _proud_ of his curves.
Wow now I know where trump got the idea
Outro aged like fine milk
This is so significant in 2025 😂
The end of this did not age well…
The americans dont stop 7:58
the end did not age well at all
HistoryDose's comment aged well
The ending of this video did not age well LMAO
Biden didn't come for Canada but Trump will.
you hate Americans.
I was looking for this vid yesterday and it wasn’t here😭😭 so glad it’s back 🙏
👀
The ending to this hits really different in 2025.
Don’t invade Canada
The McDonald's is crazy 🤣
The ending of this video was Glorious LMAO, this is what happens when you oversimplify history lmao
In light of current events, that ending definitely doesn’t feel sarcastic so much as prescient.   Though you got the President wrong.
The ending to this video did not age well considering we have trump talking about canada as the 51st state.
Yeahhhhh that whole invade Canada thing hasnt aged well into 2025 with the current insanity of the white house...
Oh boy did this age well...
invade canada huh? :p
watching the end in 2025 is crazy 💀
37:12 watching this in 2025 and this part is getting a little too real...
the last 30 seconds of this video are pure gold
Our social studies class watched this
The end of this video isn’t as funny in 2025.
settlement?? mass murder n robbery! smh
Chat, are we cooked?
I'm in the pro manfest destiny camp
Ironically enough, I watched this video again in 2025, and there might be an off-chance that Canada indeed becomes the 51st state lol You may have unintentionally predicted the future, but time will tell.
You think there are three channels but they're actually five channels the two are secret a while the two are just big if you actually look at google maps you would see there was two little rivers across one island in where the sheep guy was there and he wasn't there in the ever so they had to split in the middle
I love how after 3 years the ending of the video may become true
These what if’s were funny when you released this… I’m feeling different now..
Trump is going to invade Canada
That canada rant aged poorly huh
Me laughing over 2025 right now.
The ending of this aged well....... 🙄🙄
This didn’t age well
The ending isn’t even satire in 2025
The end of this video aged like fine wine !
Just watched this video in 2025. I loved these videos but the last 2-min are now full cringe. I guess satire is now dead.
Ah, so General Harney was the Trump of his time.
this looks like a movie ngl
Trump definitely watched 37:11
The ending hits differently now in 2025 dueing Trumps administration 😂
37:28 this aged poorly…
I don't think any American wants Canada . it's ok.😂
Biden is coming is the single handed most terrifying line I have ever heard
Biden? MORE LIKE TRUMP BABY
This video lost its crown as longest oversimplified video by  the second punic war p3 SERIOUSLY. HOW IS PIG LONGER THAN EVERY OTHER VIDEO
The ending aged poorly
Man, I don't know if the ending aged well or badly
So close it was not Biden to make Canada part of the USA. It might be Trump to start WWIII and attempt to take Canada.
37:11 Uh oh.
The French are white tho
Wow that sure was a good video, I really doubt any of it will age poorly!  The last 90 seconds for some reason:
I dont think drake as president would go very well💀
Remember:if the eyes aren't just dots,  they are important
This video was oddly prophetic, and aged like a fine wine
If you came here for All-Star Reference go to 7:57
I love how the canadians had this same problem with Denmark about a much smaller rock, and we fought it with whiskey🤣 now we have a trade war, and we're actually close to fighting about it (also because we don't want to be a 51st state)
19:05 it feels like someone just kill your pet in Minecraft 💀💀
this canada joke at end aged like milk in early 2025 :P
“You’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re in idiot, you’re an idiot, you guys are fine, and YOU TWO, are the most mind-numbingly braindead ding-dongs I’ve ever encountered in all my life, and I’ll SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE.” My favorite quote from Oversimplified.
Trump watched the end and took it seriously 😂😂
Funny how the Canada part was seen as a riduculous joke just 3 years ago
37:14 this did not age well
I dare you to say "spread like a disease" in the context of the Muslim expansion or any other civilization, culture or race that ever conquered lands...
So you are the lunatic that gave Trump the idea to make Canada the 51st state ......
Buchanan!!!!!!!
Trump salivating right now
That part about invading Canada aged well
The end of this video did NOT age as intended lol
Imagine being called a fuck-up and an idiot by literally every account of you that survives.
Biden and his whole family are crooks! Just so you know
The ending aged well
37:18 well this aged well
the more i learn about american history the more i realize that they might just be the bad guys
This is 2025 and America want to make Canada the 51st state
That was crazy 😅😅😅
ok the war tatic is good and nice video
This ending lowkey gave Trump ideas
That small rap ate everything up 😂😂😂😂
it's shocking how badly the end aged lmao
The ending aged perfectly
"Can we still invade canada?" Well, about that...
Wrong President at the end.
37:25 soon™️
@oversimplified ... the end of this video really didn't age well...or maybe too well
dammit who shared this video with Trump?
so drake is the leader, what's new?
37:15 really disrespectful to the Canadians
this is like the first time I've seen you mention Canada in your videos and I've watched all of them
also @the weakestunionberlinenjoy4536 I just moved to Canada and even tho im not Canadian I find this mildly offensive
meanwhile I am watching the last part when I just moved to Canada??? Bruh.
I fear Trump watched this video recently...
37:00 aged poorly lol
Love how well this aged just trump instead of biden came for canada
8:06 hey now you’re all star
The little dude carrying the macdonalds was awesome..
So uhhh, Benjamin Franklin might get those curves after all 😅
this aged..poorly
America is never going to annex Canada. Not militarily. Not economically. Not ever. Peaceful unification I can see, but this isn’t that.
We should rename it after we make it the 51st state
that ending is a prophecy
I will say, the ending of this video did not age well, lol :P
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone in 2025 remember how the end seemed to be a joke? 😂😂
ending isn't funny anymore :/
Why are you trying to make creating America a bad thing.
7:57 to 8:02 lol 😂
The ending aged poorly, eh?
“can america Still Invade Canada” cries in american living in 2025
Unlike the other comment I think the ending aged like milk lol
You're so funny 🤣🤩 I love your jokes 😆 Even the memes😅
0:17 omg so cute 😍
37:12 Oh boy...
😂 and it turned out that Trump is talking about Canada being the 51st state (feb 2025)
Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction Sorcerers of death's construction  In the fields, the bodies burning As the war machine keeps turning Death and hatred to mankind Poisoning their brainwashed minds Oh, Lord, yeah!  Politicians hide themselves away They only started the war Why should they go out to fight? They leave that all to the poor, yeah!  Time will tell on their power minds Making war just for fun Treating people just like pawns in chess Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!  Now, in darkness, world stops turning Ashes where their bodies burning No more war pigs have the power Hand of God has struck the hour  Day of Judgment, God is calling On their knees, the war pigs crawling Begging mercies for their sins Satan, laughing, spreads his wings Oh, Lord, yeah!
😂😂 😂😂 o how the things happening now
7:31 16:36   7:24 16:27
Ngl that Canada bit at the end didn't age so well. He got the wrong president tho
5:56 what the f
Man that ending has aged extremely well
Boy that ending used to be a lot funnier
Watching this in 2025 is super ironi 😂 😂 especially the end 😂 😂
The invading Canada did not age well😅😂
the ending did not age well lol
Last time the usa attacked Canada washington was burnt down and the usa ran home...
Just watched this in early 2025... I hope Canada stays strong! From 🇦🇺 Commonwealth!
Oversimplified was correct, Trumps proposing to annex Canada as our 51st state
Here in 2025. The ending is more of a possible dark omen.
yikes, trump 2025
Man you predicted the future …
Epic foreshadowing of 2025 😆
That last joke aged like milk
Lol that ending didn't age well lol
He should make a video about Blackbeard that would be cool
37:10 Crazy how a joke has turned into a real possibility. Like the pig, I’d rather die than become American.
The end of this video jits different in 2025 😅
this aged well
I love how Trump is actually trying to get Canada now
At 4:43 did any one notice that the natives are warring the colours of what is Hudson Bay company today?
Bro had a Vision
To make the ending even better, Drake is president with the caption "to my certified lover boys" after a diss track against the lover boy won 5 grammys
37:15hmmm this aged well
Trump had to watch this 51st state
Looks like 2026 may end up bringing the United States of Canada into fruition. 😅
Don’t show the end to Trump
I dont know if the end of this video "aged poorly" or is a semi accurate prediction of how some "Americans" think.
Who knew Trump was such a fan of Oversimplified!
Dude is secretly trump with a voice changer with all those plans at the end.
i see what u did there 7:58
Wow, that ending did not age well.
14:11  When you try to take an island but the island tribes have guns
This aged poorly and as a Canadian you can take our land after killing us all and the rest of nato
That Biden comment agreed about as well as your demented old kid-sniffing president. Don't make is burn down the white house again,  eh?
The “YEEEEHAAAAAW!” was so goddamn hilarious it had me on the floor (Jennifer Lopez reference 😂)  absolutely laughing the shit out of my lungs
This aged well 😂
This is one of my favorite episodes 😂 I just wonder if trump got the idea of invading canada from this 🤔
its honestly really sad how a joke about america invading canada might actually become true
man that last bit at the end really did not age well
the ending aged like wine
7:57 but the americans keep coming and they don’t stop stop coming, hopped in the wagons and they hit the ground running 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
That ending didn't age well...
7:57 if you put all star it will sound like all star
Well…The ending aged well…
Trump just saw this video and say  Hell yeah
In 2025, that ending has aged like milk XD
who showed the ending of the video to President Trump
The islands are British
I love the ending 😁
The ending aged HORRIBLY in SO MANY WAYS LOL
32:36 YOOO THE MEME
Strange enough matter of Canada turning up again in the modern age.
As soon as a video starts advertising for VPN with the argument of not giving my data to strangers, when a vpn does precisely that, I stop the video and go do something else.
You call THAT “make a better place?!?!
YOU PREDITCED THIS SHIT?!
Oversimplified is truly a time traveller
37:10 That's called foreshadowing
Biden's letter to Trump was invade Canada
Ooff the outro on this did NOT age well
Stuff at the end there has aged like cottage cheese on a window sill in July.
Can someone check Trumps browser history to see if he watched this video a short while ago
Manifest Destiny = Lebensraum???
Somehow today the idea of the US invading Canada does not sound as far fetched as before.
The ending aged like fine wine
"We deserve these lands because God said so"......welp...this aged video aged well
37:08  well this joke sure didn’t age well.
He needs to make pt#2 bc oh boi the news today about America and Canada are Hot😮
I was wondering why this only popped back up in my feed after 3 years. It was the Canadian bit at the end. Very topical for right now I guess
Watching this in 2025 hits different
That US invading Canada thing at the end aged Horribly. LOL
The end…
AMERICANS RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   CANADIANS DROOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Boy that ending really didnt age well
Looking at it now with trump saying canada will be the 51st state. Seems like round 2 woth canada is underway 😅
I think Trump is going to conquer Canada
31:00  I was taken so off guard by the Morgan Freeman voice
1:24 Benjamin absolutely got fried 😂
this ending aged like milk
Billy right no sharrons cat I hear voices all time
if you think the tune in 7:58 is similar its from smash mouth all star
I completely forgot about the ending of this video. Good god did it age.
That 51st state comment, not looking to great right now.
the ending of this video aged very well. 51st state here we come
Aged like milk lol
OverSimplified is 3 years ahead of our timeline.
Watching this about 3 weeks after our returning guy in office told Canada that he was gonna make them our 51st state. What are the lottery numbers, Oversimplified????
Pig war happend in serbia with Austrians not here
That explains why Douglas Rd is the largest and most important street in Victoria,on Vancouver Island. And was the Boardwalk in Monopoly Canadian Edition way back in the day.
Off by one potus 🤦🏻‍♂️
37:08 are you happy
31:00 There are no laws against the potatoes, Batman.
This just beats Archduke Franz Ferdinand on a different level. 😂😂😂
This is ironic that I'm watching the video right now and at the last part of the video, Oversimplified is talking about taking over Canada. And right now there's controversy over whether Trumpet Man will take over Canada or Greenland
loved it!
Am I the only one who realized this is a reference from "smash mouth" song 7:58
we all came back here for 2025 lol
7:58 they don’t stop coming
2025 checking in...does donald watch oversimplified?
I think we needa update the ending of this video from Biden to Trump.
"The Pig War" sounds so stupid I though it was fiction 😭
Just here to say that last little bit was some crazy foreshadowing
It's now 2025, and I've got to say the last part of the video has not aged particularly well
Oof, this part did not age well given what 45 is currently talking about. xD
Me
You know, with all this Drumpf 51st state crap, the ending of the video is hitting a little close to reality right now
37:20 i bet trump watched this
Canada preper for WAR trumps comming!
Anyone in 2025? 😂
Trump saw the ending and took inspiration
The ending didnt age well
Watching this again in '25 is completely different
38:18  More like Trump is coming for Governor Trudeau, and the 51st State.
Wow that ending aged badly!
I can totally see trump invading Canada over a pig
That’s about to be Trumps land😂
Then Trump Happened
I cant decide whats dumber:  Going to war over a shot pig  OR  Going to war because of a trade deal YOU YOURSELF signed!
This might be the only video from his channel that actually isn’t oversimplified
37:10 my lord this aged so well
The  pig ate the moorhead moscot
38:11 No it's Trump
It’s my densityyyyyyyyy! 😂😂😂
Loved the half-baked reference
Hmm, Not sure the last part of the video has aged very well. Or maybe its aged perfectly!
The ending is pretty accurate.
I am in canada dude why that was a bit rude
‏‪38:12‬‏ it's going to become reality under trump
Ere's TRUMP
Watching this video in 2025 and seeing oversimplified taking taking over Canada did not age well haha.
Sooo... About that ending...
How he forcasted future
the ending is perfect lol now with all the talk of Trump with Canada
Here’s two video idea for you to consider OverSimplified: The Greco-Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War?
37:03 did not age well lol
37:00 BRO THIS ISNT EVEN A JOKE ANYMORE LMFAO 😭
That joke at the end is aging badly
The ending… 💀
37:11: Well, that aged well...
crazy how this could have inspired Trump
37:08 if you asked me this question 3 years ago, I would've laughed. Now with this guy in power... Idk what to think anymore.
36:57 the fact that this once was a silly joke years ago, and now became a real source of diplomatic tensions in the world. Say do you secretly have Simpsons prediction power?
2025 and the ending might not be so funny
… well, it won’t be Drake…
Man oh man has the ending of this video aged like milk. It is sad that what used to be a joke, though, is now such a hot topic
See, America youve always been like that LOL😂
Bro I just have to know if the person who is doing oversimplified just goes on Wikipedia or it a history teacher or smth 😅
welp. we can all say that the joke about canada being annexed by the US has aged like milk.. sorry oversimplified.
8:10
38:07 spoilers
This may be the reason why Trump wants Greenland 🇬🇱
The islands belong to Canada, period. Germany doesn't have a say in shit. This new trade war the Dorito wants to start is a great starting point to take it back.
Who's here in 2025?
biden ...
no
nooooooooooooooo
no
Enybody here in 2025 where Trump is about to do it
Oversimplified had vision
2025 anyone?
What?! 37:50
That ending didn't age well 😂😂😂
30:11 jackson wouldn't have been helping harney at this point because he was dead
You Canadians just had to complain that Oversimplified doesn't talk about your country. You brought your statehood upon yourself. Now, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way, my fellow Americans.
welp the US invsion of Canada part hits different in 2025..
before u mentioned biden i had to check the age of the video cuz trumps THAT much of a joke that this is now very much reality
That last part has been aging really well
Now that ending can be official, and thats hilarous
Honestly, Canada should’ve had that land. America could barely take care of itself back then, let alone now.
37:15 Trump watched this and really thought to himself "WHY NOT?"
37:07 i now blame Oversimplified
Oversimplified is the new Simpsons, predicting events by making a comedy skit, however when it comes true it's a lot less funny.
This has aged really well
37:11 well that aged well...
Bro is basically predict that Canada is going to be part of the US because of Trump. Is he a fortuneteller?
37:25 cant wait to see oversimplified reaction to when the next US president speaks French and bans speaking English and his slogan is I’LL MAKE THIS COUNTRY FRENCH AGAIN!!!!!!
I could see General Scott doing his best not banning his head agents the table.  I mean being a negotiator he would of had to sit down with those two idiots and have them explain why the pig died while everyone else BUT  Willum, his greatest hatred, trying to keep everyone calm.
The Canadian annexation jokes are becoming to real in 2024
The bit at the end about invading Canada aged poorly.
Canadians sleep with one eye open
The end of this video did not age well lmao
The Brits were smart enough to realize what the provocation actually was. They would have surely lost everything if they attacked the Americans. If would've given America the justification needed to take it all.
3:33 damnnnn America is packing
From some perspectives, the end of this video aged INCREDIBLY poorly.
foreshadowing
I don't know about biden but trump gonna definitely come...😅
Watching this in 2025 has a new meaning!!! Long live Canada Americas 51st state!!!!!
The drake president joke did not age well
Dude that comment about invading canada is no joke now
That ending joke didn't age well. 😂
26:04 Cursed frame
That outro hits way different in January 2025 ☹️
Trump discovers this video before 20th of  January
37:20 “Just as Oversimplified predicted…”
Congratulations, you’re a prophet!
Wow speaking from Jan 2025 the ending is looking very prophetic
37:25 where trump got his inspiration from
This aged like fine wine lol
Who else watching this after Trump proposed annexing Canada?
Ohhh that ending aged like raw meat
37:16 Im convinced that oversimplified possessed trump since december
2025 update trump is the one in charge but is indeed planning an invasion of Canada
So who’s watching this in 2025 with a mental meme of Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at the TV?
Just remembered something...
welp its clear donald trump watched this video
14:00 Me waiting for an Oversimplefied in 2026
Its funny how the Canada invasion thing has aged with trump now
That ending though, *chefs kiss*. Aged like fine wine. Living right next to the San Juans makes this video extra fun lmao
so 37:16 is where President Trump got the idea to invade Canada.  Thank you Oversimplified
Bro predicted the future
Straight line? Straight line. Livea rent free in my head.
Oversimplified is one of the few YouTubers that can convince me to watch the sponsor segment all the way through
Trump watched this video for sure
Trump saw this video with his nightly macdonalds and Diet Coke, was like  “if Biden won’t do it, I’ll f*@king do it!”
7:57 is pure gold!!
37:08  "The aging of wine is potentially able to improve the quality of wine. This distinguishes wine from most other consumable goods. While wine is perishable and capable of deteriorating, complex chemical reactions involving a wine's sugars, acids and phenolic compounds (such as tannins) can alter the aroma, color, mouthfeel and taste of the wine in a way that may be more pleasing to the taster. The ability of a wine to age is influenced by many factors including grape variety, vintage, viticultural practices, wine region and winemaking style. The condition that the wine is kept in after bottling can also influence how well a wine ages and may require significant time and financial investment.[1][2] The quality of an aged wine varies significantly bottle-by-bottle, depending on the conditions under which it was stored, and the condition of the bottle and cork, and thus it is said that rather than good old vintages, there are good old bottles. There is a significant mystique around the aging of wine, as its chemistry was not understood for a long time, and old wines are often sold for extraordinary prices. However, the vast majority of wine is not aged, and even wine that is aged is rarely aged for long; it is estimated that 90% of wine is meant to be consumed within a year of production, and 99% of wine within 5 years." (Wikipedia)
We all know why we are here
Drake as president? Don’t blame me, I voted for Kendrick.
Considering harney's performance in the Mexican American war, I doubt he had any capacity for scheming or long-term planning. I side with the historians that think he was just being a hot-headed moron.
Drake? Wow finally someone who understands me
Who knows what the ending song is at the end of all his videos?
Actually, crazy how this is 3 years ago
Wow. This invasion of Canada idea is surprisingly topical right now 😂
It's not Biden who's coming, though
The end of this video aged like sour milk.
37:10 this didnt age well
Actually Wayne Gretzky does wave the American flag as soon as he was traded from to the Los Angeles Kings, and then when he retired from hockey he decided to stay in Los Angeles into this very day he is still in Los Angeles., and raised four to five kids I believe here in America
Oof, the Canada diatribe now smells like old milk.... 2025
37:07 The joke at the end about invading Canada hits different in 2025
I HATE AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!
7:40 diarrhea having
the drake thing did not age well
Biden couldn’t make it guys, so Trump is coming
Wait did this video inspire Trump's ideas to invade Canada?
And now America is invading Canada 😂
That canada joke at the end didnt age well
"Can America... still invade Canada?" "Our Glorious President, Drake"  Oh this did not age well
37:12 as we can see, yes.
Trumps blody Dream
38:03 these comments just got real. Trump needs to stop watching your videos.
The ending was the most American thing there can be
One president off
Well the ending had some truth to it. Just the wrong president.
3:34 you gave amerima a peneis
2025 and Trump wants Canada 😂😂😂
Share this video with Donald Trump for the ending
Trump watched the end of this video and was like, “Ya know what this guy has a point”
I positively flinched during this rewatch when he mentioned that Harney might have wanted to become President, because he'd have a _very_ strong chance at being elected nowadays. He's exactly the type of character that American voters admire, a windbag expansionist who'd threaten the sovereignty of our Canadian brothers.
Who is here after Trump joking about Canada being the 51 state of the USA
all star reference 7:59
Boy. The end of the video didnt age well. 😂😂😂😂 Turns out it's another president who is gunning for Canada.😂😂😂
That...that ending didn't age well...
I CANT TAKE THIS PART SERIOUSLY 16:34
That ending didn’t age well
He predicted that the USA would try to invade Canada
i really hope trump doesnt watch this video.
Oversimplified must love trumps idea of Canada being the 51st state cuz of his manifest destiny fetish
Oh man, who's gonna tell him 37:00
this is unbelived your vidoes are the bestttttttttttttttttt!!!!!
1:26 that one didn’t aged well 😂😂😂
the fact trump is trying to get canada now😭
Fast forward to January 2025, trump wants to invade canada… what was oversimplified cooking
That ending aged well in 2025
that last part did not age good
When I heard the name I had to google it to confirm but yeah.. I’m from South Dakota and the highest point in the Black Hills was always called Harneys Peak until the feds finally changed the name in 2016. And yes I guess it was named after William Harney. Shouldn’t be surprised though considering our largest state park is still named after Custer.
Berkshire pork is delicious tbh
It's me from 2025.... so did Oversimplified predict the future? Because Pres. Trump wants to buy Canada...
37:20 this aged well…
also random thing but does anyone know the music that plays at 7:24 ?
A moral justification for Manifest Destiny and the removal of Indians was rested on the premise that it facilitated the spread of Christianity, civilization, and moral order. European settlers believed they were fulfilling God’s will by bringing biblical teachings and technological progress to a land of barbaric cannibalistic savages. This was a necessary act to promote divine providence and the greater good. I agree it should've been done with less to no bloodshed, but the Indians were not innocent in this either.
Florida looks like America has a wiener 3:34
37:08 that didn't age quite so well
Well well well
That ending aged well
37:16
3:40 our 'density'
Trump anyone?
16:35 Vanoss, is that you?
32:32 S/O to “Half Baked”😊
well with trumps coments 51 state of canada this aged well
Yikes. The ending of this video really didn't age well 😅
“I hear voices all the time” Me, too, OS. Me, too.
Anyone in 2025 thinking about that ending?
oh god that ending didn't age well
The ending did not age well.
“I thought it was Sharon’s cat”😭😭😭😭😭😭 3:54
Does the pig look like waddles to anyone else?
well, it seems that Trump is coming, with a vengeance
this aged well
Watching this again now that taking Canada appears to be a possibility on the new administration's political bingo card is pretty hilarious
Well, that speech at the end aged poorly, and to all American citizens: we bear no ill will to you, but Jesus Christ, sort out your politicians
*MOLE MOLE MOLE MOLE*
I think Donald Trump has been watching your videos
the end of this has aged like milk
The ending has ages in a weird way.
The lack of a disclaimer over the ending considering current events is somewhat alarming
this ending aged so god damn poorly it's not even funny
Came back to this to see who else has been thinking about this video's ending in light of recent events, and I'm not disappointed!
38:15 This aged poorly, in a way at least
36:25
that ending aged poorly.
That Ending aged incredibly well
that ending is so topical now.
That ending is a liitle on the nose
Well done oversimplified, you gave Trump an idea that he's gonna act on. Oversimplified started a war, put that in your video in 20 years time!
This war was so stupid because now I have to watch a 38 minute video about a war that never happened on my binge watch
37:07 2025 and this might happen
I KNEW HE WAS THE OLD GUY FROM H8TEFUL EIGHT
Urine idiot 💀💀
Who would of thought that now in 2025 the USA is talkin about annexing Canada
28:39
16:20
The end really aged well if you think about the situation rn
Watching this in 2025 is wild, because trump is joking about invading and annexing Canada
16:00 AK 47 firing
37:09 aged badly
Well that last speech really aged well
This  aged badly 37:23
31:20
Bro accidentally predicted Trump’s proposal to annex Canada
Oh my god the ending aged so poorly...
wow, watching this today and thinking... you prophetic!  :)  but really Canadians right now  :o
Bro is a prophet
37:39 this feels more and more probable now. Possible? no way. Probable? yes.
Sooooooo..... how about that canada rant in 2025?😅
Three years after this video was published, Trump plans to take Canada. I wonder how this will turn out, don't you?
Ages so bad
37:19 uh oh. Did Trump watched Oversimplified crash out…?
Well that ending hasn't aged well
The end of this video aged well😭
speech at the end is feeling a little too real rn 😭
Oh my god, the end sounds scarier today !
Bit too real expecially now
So uh, 2025 is here, trump is president again and this did not age well- (trump wants to make canada the 51st state)
Mf doom 11:22
31:30 is absolute GOLD….😂😂😂
The ending aged so poorly with current political "aspirations "?
37:14 this aged like milk
37:14-37:42 patriot guy
Remember when oversimplified said to invade Canada? Well… I think that might actually happen
37:10 that part aged particularly well as of early 2025.
Bober Kurwa 😢
He definitely voted for Trump
If you are watching this video in 2025 Canada curves will be ours Americas
The whole invading Canada thing did NOT age well....
The end of this video did not edge well😂
So...we need to talk about Canada, right.
Welp that ending sure aged well. Except it wouldn’t be Joe coming. 😅
Please do not invade Canada I love it here
Love how the islands look like the world map
Wow this ending aged well, especially that Drake comment
23:57, oh no he has advantage on his next roll
This video was a Simpson level prediction. Trump was the only part he missed.
I bet when you made the outro to this video, you never thought it'd come true lol. I mean, it's not Biden, but close enough lol.
33:22 he’s still watching
32:08
Ooh, Canada😅 Greetings from January 2025
I mean the funny thing is you got the invasion of Canada right. You just got the wrong president
37:10 hmmm sounds familiar
The end of this video did not age well… except it’s not Biden who might be coming
This video aged well
Donald Trump definetly watched this video and got inspired.
Proof that Trump watches Oversimplified
the end of this video has aged well
How the hell are have we progressed back to 1783 with the states wanting to annex Canada again.
Holy shit he was almost correct. Just instead of Biden Trump is talking about taking Canada
The engling lol ahahah😂
These videos are so rewatchable
14:00 blud should've wore a top before this lmao
That last bit about invading Canada just got insanely funnier this month
Well, no wonder the videos are a bit slow coming if Oversimplified is busy pulling the strings of the US government behind the scenes. Should have seen it sooner, really.
Consudering Trump wants Canada to be the 51st state this outro didn't age well
This is actually taught in Canadian high schools LOL
I hate that this is topical again
Welp, the ending of this video did not age well in 2025 (like the current US president).  Loved the video though!
1:28 sound familiar?
The end of this one aged *very* poorly thanks to recent bullshit.
Well this aged like milk 💀
38:11 *Trump is Coming Baby
37:20 well...
Guess Trump watched this video once and got the idea
33:19
The ending of this video is now closer to become reality.......
Rewatching this, it’s scary how close that last part could actually happen
please do a vedio on hiada gwaii
This aged well
This is OverSimplified’s magnum opus
My first time watching this video was today in 2025 and given the current political climate and the mentioned annexation of Canada i thought this was a bit funny
i feel so stereotypically 'merican getting an adrenaline rush from the end of that video
You know, seeing how the British in this video are usually represented by the colour red, I’m guessing it has something to do with the term “Red Coat” that is sometimes used by Americans to describe British people.
2:17:  Pretty rubbish looking map I’ll say.
OOOF Invading Canada is now on the Table. How did you know?!?
You’re off by one president but otherwise a pretty solid prediction
i think trump watched this and decided to make canada the 51st state
that last part didn’t age well
Aged like fine wine
This is one of the finest episodes 😂. Oversimplified please make more videos.
Quick question, why is the ending pertinent in 2025?
That ending sure hits differently with Trump 2.0 😬
that last minute and a half aged like milk.
33:29 😲😲😲😲
37:16 this aged well
It was the Canadian who burnt down the white house and it wasn’t a draw Canada won the war of 1812. The British didn’t show up until the last year of the war of 1812.
The end part aged sooo so badly....  t
37:20 - Think Trump's been watching some Oversimplified
That ending to the video has aged poorly.
@37:11 -- looks bocome true
3:34  okay bruhh you can't even hide it
I don’t think that Drake joke at the end aged very well
Now way the American invasion of Canada was predicted 3yrs ago💀
38:00 OH NO NOT BIDEN
19:36 reasonable crashout
Please no invading Canada
This is all your fault Oversimplified! You gave Trump the idea to invade Canada! For its sweet sweet Maple Syrup and Poutine
Ending hits different now xD
Aged like fine milk...
This videos ending AGED LIKE GOLD.
That ending aged.....hilariously.   Trump talks a lot.  Our leadership was weak.  He trolled like a pro. He is a couple days in atm.  Invasion....unlikely.
“BECAUSE BIDENS COMING BABY” *trump re-elected in 2024* “we are going to take back the Panama Canal, take Greenland, and take Canada.”
0:51 “I didn’t say they were white people” is crazy 💀💀💀💀
Here after Trump declared Trudeau to be a mere governor but before he annexed Canada
Watching this now with the potential what ifs of Canada joining the US is wild
"there's still hope for Joe Biden" lol he's out of office now
I'm glad i'm not the only american that thinks past americans and american mentality is like an infectious pest roach
%h!t man, trump must have watched this one...
37:12 well well well
You REEAAALLLYYY should not have shown this to Trump.
The last part didnt age quite well
37:08 I think I know where did Trump get his idea from 😂😅
OverSimplified predicted Thrumps ambitions on Canada XD
the final part of the video aged like a fine wine
19:37  how much was 100$ at that time?
3 years later and I just realized it says Density, not destiny.
That ending did not age well.
Coming back to this three years later is wild, we may very well actually invade Canada.
Y'know, the joke at the end of this video hits different in January 2025
Watching that ending in 2025 is surreal
I sincerely hope Canada won't be invaded because that's stupid
Well I am a little bit late today 😕
37:16 this aged poorly……..
Man, the ending of this video did not age well.
With Donald Trump's repeated comments about Canada as a 51st state, this video's outro has aged very well.
Anyone watching this while Trump is talking about buying Canada??
I don't think Biden's coming every I think Canada is actually coming ever
the ending for this video was more prophetic than i bet you expected, aside from the wrong president...
Canada should join the Union!!!!!
37:14 oooohff! That ending didn’t quite age so well.
The Canada joke sure did age quite interestingly.
Did my guy predict trump part 2 at the end?
Trump rn trying to to own canDa
Oh man, in the context of 2025, the ending of this video hasn't aged well 😂
Watching this after trump is threatening Canada is so funny 😂
It's so funny how the last seconds aged since last year's elections.
Trump took the ending very seriously
Jan 21st, 2025, Trump talking about annexing Canada brings back memories of the final speech of the video
that last part aged in a strange way....
The ending aged like wine
watching this after Trump literally said "Manifest Destiny" in his inauguration speech
Lol, thanks for giving Trump the idea 🤣
Trump's coming baby....and this time he's coming with a Vengeance!!!
Aged like wine
lmao the America annexing Canada ruled by Drake aged DOUBLE poorly
The ending about US taking over Canada didn't age very well 😐
The ending aged amazingly
37:16 that aged well…
I thing Trump has seen this video. And got some stupid ideas.
37:09
great video!
"Who spoke to god exactly?"  "I heard it was Sharon's cat"  besides the videos being so awesome little details like this make rewatching a ton worth while
I wonder how the “non-white” people got the land in the first place. I’m sure it wasn’t tribal violence.
1:28 Substitute in Donald Trump and Canada instead of Britain, and history really does repeat itself. Grab your muskets lads..
37:10 this part aged very well
Well I can See why the algorithm would be recommending this as of recent.
The last bit is no longer parody...
this video age well
7:57 all star reference 🤩
That ending is hilarious for a number of 2024 reasons
Aged like roman wine
Oh shit~ hey mate, Canada may try to hunt you down now~ hahahhahah
Well the end didn't age well 😂😂😂
Oversimplified... your great an all but stay away from Canada.
The last 3 minutes of this aged like fine, unpasteurized milk
Harney is also known as the butcher general, from when he slaughtered hundreds people from the Sioux tribe by the black hills... Then he got the highest point in south Dakota named after him for successfully taking the land for the white people. It was finally changed a few years ago. The point is, he wasn't just incompetent, he was a raging bigot who was happy to go genocide a people for basically clout
wayne gretsky? invading canada? i didn't expect this to turn out into foreshadowing XD
37:11 it is 2025 and people are talking about doing this
In 2025, trupm might do that
The ending to this video aged like fine wine
18:37 he pumps a double barrel shotgun.
37:12 this aged well
I love the Blade Runner Style “Enhancement” animation joke. 😂
4:10 Yeah boys, that's glorious!!!!  Stupid buffalos....
anyone 2025?
16:29 rednote users
The joke starting at 37:10 is absolutely amazing
Uhhhh this aged poorly
The British had every right to the island. The Americans have sent a customs_collector, the lowliest life form known to man, thus forfeiting any claim to the territory.
2025 - USA invading Canada is no longer a joke.
Clickbait
Who's here after Trudeau resigned and Trump is seriously considering making Canada, Greenland, and Mexico part of America? Here on inauguration day 2025!!!
16:29 Canadians when America got unbanned from TikTok
honey steals affiliate link money uninstall it to support your content creators
1:09 Yup It happened Canada is now American
As of today that Canada Invasion joke is a key example of life imitating art.
38:16 Trump is coming baby
GERMANY MENTIONED 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
This is literally the funniest sh|t I’ve ever seen 😂😂
WELL WELL WELL!
LOL😂😂can't believe the americans are actually eyeing canada in 2025.....
The ending wasn't a joke. It was a prophecy.
37:15 bro predicted trump plans of annexing canada
You show your bias my friend. Tell me of a group of people that conquered and didn't have plans to spread like rats.
American history 🤯 hateful racist murderer arrogant bigots just sickening 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Welp. Sorry fellas. President Joe Biden didn't Invade Canada.  Maybe in 2029.  we'll see what's in the cards
Why do people cry when american took the western half of the country? Every single country ever did the same thing
37:48 this aged poorly.
See America? You've always been this way.
the ending hits different now that trump is president
Good video.  Out of date though.  Can you update it to mock Trump like you mocked Pickett and Harney?  :)
Awk in 2025
American here.  Canadians are our best buds, and the end of this video is like a silly joke between friends... at least it was until President Elect Trump started making it weird and taking it seriously.  I don't want it to be weird.
Are you watching the episode in January 2025  I think Donald Trump watches oversimplified😂😂😂
Ok after watcbing the two lunic wars videos and half lf this one u clearly in my top 3 history channnel
0:48 Fun fact: the beautiful wonderful diverse indigenous peoples killed each other and conquered each other's land all the time! But it's only bad when White people do it apparently.
TRUMP is coming. But Bidens are crying 😂
the ending aged very well for 2025
37:13 Well this didn't age well.
Trump defines watched the last part before his recent interviews
This video has aged poorly after Trumps' threats to annex Canada.
37:15 - Aged like a fine *wine* ! OverSimplified. You have no idea.
One more day guys
The last part aged rather poorly
That drake joke is wild
The last part aged like wine
hang on a tick. oversimplified predicted Trump vs Canada 3 years ago.
10:32 As a Brit, I can confirm that this is real footage from the House of Commons
lol
This hits way different now on 19.01.2025 38:08
Video is outdated.. Its trump who is coming for Canada
37:13 That didn't age well, did it? (From 2025)
Suddenly the invade Canada joke became much less funny
Man this video did not age all that well 37:18
This video aged twice
Oh that invading canada joke aged well……..
trump is coming
3:37 ITS MY DENSITY
37:51 hm....
This ending aged well in 2025
The ending of this video rivals Oppenheimer's ending
I think trump watched this and took the ending seriously 😂
The end of this aged poorly. Or amazingly.
watching this after trump said he wants to make Canada the 51st state is wild
Do not let Trump see this video.
2021 as a joke : the US should invade Canada! 2025 under Trump : yeah we should do that for real
That ending aged poorly.
William Harney as evil and dumb as trump... OF COURSE he was BFF with that POS Andrew Jackson.
Revisiting this video after Donald's claims to take on Canada as U.S. territory is quite hilarious. Especially with the ending
Watching this in 2025 seeing the ending after trump saying he wants Canada makes me think oversimplified knew things… 🧠
Who’s watching this on January 18th 2025 and living in Canada
The ending is becoming more and more likely, except the Drake Part
If Canadians didn't want to be part of the US, 90% of their population wouldn't be within 100 miles/160 km from the US border.
37:15 bro was onto something
Rewatching this in 2025 makes so much sense
Finally!
Maybe it was Trump after all.
Another Fun fact: Lyman buried the pig but didn’t put dirt over it then Griffin one day fell in the hole
Fun fact: The pig was eating off a part of Lyman’s house the day before. When Griffin came to get his pig, Lyman told Griffin that if the pig did anything to his house or his crops again that it would be shot. When he heard what the pig did to Lyman’s house, Griffin said “you deserved this, you put your house in my sheep run. And you are not gonna shoot my pig”
Foreshadowing?
Anyone watching this in 2025 and Donald trump wants to by Canada 😂
Why’d you have to give the Cheeto the idea…
Watching in 2025. Trump must of seen the end of this
37:00 this onward has such a whole new meaning now XD
Who here after trump going for canada😂😂🎉🎉 37:10 truely great prediction oversimplified👏👏
The end is real now
1:33 man this aged well in 2025 eh  lol
Apollo blessed you with the gift of prophecy! please, do not resist.
This is even funnier in 2025
That ending aged very poorly😢....
7:58 " But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming... Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running"  this was amazing
2025, oh boy. Canada
Well this aged well
everyone who disliked this video was british
Biden or Trump no matter what who is POTUS. WATCH YOUR BACKS CANADA AND GREENLAND US COMING BABY ! xD
Bro, 37:19 took a serious turn! 😂 ‘merica!!! 🇺🇸🔥🇺🇸🔥🇺🇸✈️🎇🎆🧨
Ending did not age that well...
This video aged out pretty well I’d say
At this point we can make Britain our territory now
World: I hope this new President has a moral compas and respect our property rights…  Trump: MANIFEST DESTINY!
Why is everyone saying the ending aged poorly? It aged WELL XD (Even if it’s just talk)  EDIT: Maybe because it’s Trump and not Biden?
the ending has aged pretty poorly  but trump ain't getting Canada
That ending didn’t age well
Actually... looks like Trump is coming babyy :I
The ending aged well, I see
The end of this video aged poorly XD
The ending has aged well
The ending aged very poorly
37:06  Hey so this didnt age too well...
Typical americans
After hearing Donald Trump going on about Canada becoming the 51st State, this video may have a new meaning to it.  😆
SPOILER ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN PART 3          reason why scipio is known as the hero of rome is because he would defeat hannibal. Later hannibal would relectively committ sucide by drinking poison after the war
I am watching this video now in 2025 where the possibility of Canada becoming a part of the U.S. is all the rage...
Great speech at the end it will happen 🇺🇸+🇨🇦=🇺🇸
37:11 ironic considering that trump wants Canada
If only Lyman had fenced in all four sides…
3 years oversimplied dream is about to come true... because "Trumps coming baby..."  38:08
I would want middle
Funny how itss not biden but trump thats talking about taking canada xD
You killed my pig? Dude..... Uncool
American Island 🏝️
I think trump watched this video
This video came to my suggestions during when Trump are suggesting about Canada being the 51st State...weird
2:35
Boy this did age badly after the comments from Trump in January 2025 😀
3:37 ah the Israeli syndrome. Free Palestine 🇵🇸 bro
DUDE MADE TRUMP WANT CANADA
37:36 «Now, that’s controversial»
2025 and the end seems really close to that lol
Is that waddles
Biden quit
Watching this after Trumps comments about Canada hits different, but equally mad to the ending of this video.
This is hilarious in Jan 2025 as the Idiot in Chief claims Canada has to be the 51st state
WHOMST ARE HERE IN 2025? 🎉❤
Once I heard Trump talking that Canada crap, I instantly remembered this video and came back just to say it wasn’t Biden!😂😂😂
well well well ...
The ending was gold and aged like fine wine😂
37:08 well, you became like a Simpsons, you can predict the future!
Trump be like: ight bet
The ending has aged very well lmao
37:19 Oh boy I can't wait for this fallout lore
37:13 oh oversimplified and his wacky sense of hu- “4 years later”. Dammit I hate this timeline
I can’t believe that ending Canada rant could actually end up happening.
Manifest Destiny pt2 coming in quick 🔥🔥
37:19 Well that didn't age well.
37:19 looks like our manifest destiny is gonna be coming true after all
Man the more things change the more they stay the same
I’m Canadian ………
The last part of this video aged like a fine wine
incredible how more reasonable everyone was in every step on the way compared to americans, yet they ended up obtaining everything they wanted in the end
And now here in the ripe old year of 2025 It seems a certain Orange man saw this video and took the ending a biiiit too seriously
I feel like this quote from Jacksepticeye explains general Harney pretty well. “I don’t know if he’s a genius or a moron.”
HE DID NOT PREDICT TRUMP WANTING TO INVADE CANADA IN 2021 THERE IS NO WAY
Watching this last segment about US invading Canada and "Bidens coming with vengeance" after the things Trump just said makes me feel..... Uneasy
We got the US becoming the largest country by land area before GTA 6
37:09 very different content now with Trump’s comments
We got this guy predicting Trump's American Expansion into Canada before we got GTA6.
BUCHANAN 29:19
37:09 oh dear
Bro knew 😂😂
Looks like Trump watch this video 37:11
The only thing you got wrong is that it is not "Biden is coming baby" but "Trump is coming baby".
Should change “Biden’s coming baby” to “Trump’s coming baby and this time he’s coming with a VENGEANCE!!!!!!!” 🤣🤣🤣
1:17 that didn’t age well
Who else is here after Trump threatened to fulfil oversimplified's prediction?
Bro brought the prophecy
🇺🇲( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).       🇨🇦
The ending didn’t age well did it
Who’s watching this in 2025 while trump wants to annex Canada 🦅
This aged well huh?
Like if Trump's remarks today sent you here
HE PREDICTED IT
Oversimplified just predicted the future
The last part aged well
Hahaha Trump's speach about Canada reminded me of the ending of this video. Well Canadians, sleep with one eye open from now on. 😂
1:20 2025 let’s see if it happens folks. Apparently Greenland is on the list too along with the Panama Canal that Jimmy Carter specifically gave back to Panama but as of a few days now he has since passed so apparently the government just said OK well now we can take it backmaybe who knows I don’t know for all. I know this is gonna get censored.
“Strait Line? Strait Line.”
7:58 BARS
Scarily that bit about annexing Canada is starting to actually be something thrown around in government (and by government I mean one man)
This aged well.
So if Trump invades It's this guus fault huh ?
I guess Trump took the joke a little bit too seriously
Oversimplified pls change the end of this video
37:16 Trump surely thought about it
The ending bit has not aged well at all...
The invasion of canada is getting a little real.
Oh how we laughed in 2022 at the idea of America wanting to glomp Canada... 2025 hurts my heart.
37:08 not so funny now
Biden's not coming, it's Trump...
This video aged so well
This aged interestingly...
Oversimplified...
Well.. The last part of the video CERTAINLY Aged well.
the last part aged well😂😂😂
So this is where trump got the idea from?? 😂
Funny how they use that "god wants us to have this land" obviously fake excuse today and people TODAY still believe it....... free Palestine
37:12 donald trump seems to have watched this video
Love how trump is the one that’s actually going to convince Canada to join lollll
I’m watching this in 2025 and boy oh boy, did everything after 37:11 age both like milk and wine
The Ending just happens to age like the finest wine.
the last part is kinda happening rn
21:27 banana calling 😂😂😂😂😂
I think Trump watched the end of this video and that’s what convinced him
The ending has aged…interestingly.
Well….looks like it may happen 😅😂
If this video inspired Trump to surpass Harney @OverSimplified …. Not cool
Came back to say: the ending of this video has, all of a sudden, aged EXTREMELY POORLY.
38:14, i think he means trump
This aged like fine wine. We tried to warn you Canadians and you didn’t listen. Pathetic.
The ending hits different now that tump really wants Canada 🇨🇦 to be the 51 state
37:07 this aged like fine wine
Well..... that ending seems to have been taken a little bit too seriously by an incoming US president it would seem....😂
Oversimplified predicts 💀
The invasion of Canada idea has not aged great…
I think we all know why we've just come back to this video
(2025) This aged like fine wine
The prophecy is coming true
Their was no war with American and canada in 2022
37:15 Trump saw the video 😅
2:51  Napoleon is always there everywhere
The Canada stuff really didn’t age well  Trump just a posted multiple maps of the US with canada included in its borders. Feeling oddly Sudetenland-ish  It was once a silly joke but is now surprisingly serious
I think your dream it's gonna come true 38:00
This part aged really well 37:05  canada will be ours >:)
37:08 This aged well.....
Who’s watching after trump annexed Canada 😂
37:08 Welp...
well, that ending just keeps aging "better" and "better", huh?
37:08 Who's here after Trump's tweet 😂
Who's here to watch the end of the video after Trump said he's gonna annex Canada?
Well, Trump saw the ending.
37:24 aging like fine wine 🍷
*Trump is coming baby! And he’s coming with a VENGENCE!!!!!!!!*
Oh, the ending aged well.
Ironically Trump's talking about getting Canada when he comes into office in 2025. Let's see what happens.
Donald trump loves the last part
37:11 in 2021 with Oversimplified: 🤣 37:11 in 2025 with Trump: 💀
Yo, with the honey drama going down, I bet Oversimplified is rethinking his epic ad game ‘cause of potential new sponsors.
I think Trump watched the last part...
38:10 Well who would have expected you were right. Sort of. Only the president got you wrong
Given recent events the Canada rant at the end of this may now come to pass.
Anyone here after Trudeau's resignation?
the part at the beginning where the guy said that he didn't say it was white people got me so good. 😂😂😂
Biden can't even manifest his thoughts how can he manifest destiny?
It was not to be Biden who would get Canada, but Trump
That Canada invading joke aged like milk
Post more video please
03:55 in the backgroumd "I hear voices all the time😂😂😂
Ending didnt age well .. 2025 here we come
oh no I think Trump saw the end of this video
1:53 "Equators Gonna Equate" LOL
Three years later and I still LOSE IT every time Scott starts beating Harney 😂😂
16:15
HELL YEEEAAHHHH 37:24 LETS FUCKIN' GOO! TURN MONTREAL TO HIROSHIMA IN 10 MINUTES!
Lier because lieman 😂
Man I haven’t watched this one in a while ya that drake line doesn’t age well or did it age better cause he would fit with the politicians.
Well, well, well.
Trump is coming for Canada.
37:47 this aged poorly
That drake joke really dated this vid...
Is that too much to ask PRINCESS
This aged like Milk. Trump: "I'm coming."
Who’s here after Trump said he wants Canada to become the 51st state of America 😂😂
37:12 Well Well Well
All those guys stating how civilized the British are; well, here you got british people fighting british people over some small islands and a pig.
The ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Our manpower is made up of immigrants you’re welcome
pig
Craziest part about the Canada thing is what’s happening with Trump right now and Trudeau. Sounds like oversimplified has some inside information.😂😂
crap ain’t holy
10:30 “Jizzingham”…
The whole joke of USA taking Canada now sounds rather weird after the statements Trump has made recently.
You are right about one thing, but just four years too soon.  President Trump will make Canada the 51st State and Justin "Brownface" Trudeau will be its first Governor.
Sounding like Trump at the end there.
The end of the video is now more funny than ever considering that trump said he wanted to annex Canada.  I mean, reality find a way to be more weird and dumb than a comedic sketch about an almost war between british and americans  over the death of a pig.
29:05 Did President Buchanan actually hide behind a curtain when faced with a crisis? I just assumed it was so crazy it had to have actually happened.
The fact that trump came up with the idea that Canada should become the 51st state makes the ending all the more hilarious.
Didn't see that coming. 😅❤
Going back to this video and with the recent events in the last two months as of the posting of this comment, let alone the last two weeks of December 2024, this video, at least in part, hasn't aged well...
Last bit hits different now that 2025 is only a couple weeks away
After recent events in the us it was finally confirmed, Donald Trump clearly watches oversimplified and took inspiration
37:07 I AM CALLING IT ITS GONNA COME TRUE I AM PREDICTING IT AROUND NEXT 3 YEARS
Funniest vid so far
11:45 “like my British grandad king of island griffin!” Peter Griffin 2018
37:08 watching when Trumps considering invading Canada...
Very... interesting
We all know why we’re here 36:59
It’s only fitting that one of the most bizarre Oversimplified videos with one of the most passionate endings ends up aging in really weird ways three years later.
“Alright, Donald. As president elect, you need to set up good relationships with our neighbors. Just don’t say anything extreme or-“  Donald Trump: 37:08
Love to rewatched these videos
That Invasion of Canada bit aged like milk....😒
38:08 man ... this has age quite some
Who knew the ending of this video was actualy prophetic? Soon Canada. Soon 😂😂
thanks for the satire on american imperialism in their relationship to canada.
LMAO , specially the ending as Trump is in the house.  Wayne Gretzky as governor.
All I could think through throughout this video is how ‘of course griffin is Irish’. Just everything he does during the video scream Irish.  (I’m Irish)
Shockingly relevant today
Why the fuck did I think this video would be a documentary about the technoblade potato war
And here in the end of 2024 the thought of Canadian becoming part of the US has been revived
Didn’t think the ending would ever be relevant, and then Trump made his Christmas 2024 message about Canada becoming the “51st state.” 🤦‍♀️
This video is sponsored by NordVPN!                                                                             -Oversimplified
That ending hits pretty hard right about now. :'-(
classic revisionist Liberal history... comparing the expansion of white people to disease when ALL populations expand the same way... truly some vileracist shit in here...
5:57 “What the f-“ 			-some random American that was manifestly destined to say that to make the sponsorship better
12:03 lesson n°1 in pronouncing British place names : ‘er’ generally sounds like ‘ar’
am i crazy or did he just start singing all star at 7:57
20:20 General Harney was much more than just a hothead, a loose cannon and an ambitious charlatan. He was also exceptionally-cruel and sadistically-violent.   Early in his career, he had an iron miner severely flogged for selling alcohol to his enlisted men, brutalized an auctioneer in St. Louis who mocked his mentor President Andrew Jackson (which is wholly unsurprising), and in 1834, he kidnapped and savagely beat an enslaved young mother named Hannah, who he claimed stole his in-laws house keys. With a rawhide strap. For three days. Until she died of shock and multiple organ failure. Even in slaveholding Missouri, Harney’s actions were seen as diabolically-vicious. An angry mob almost destroyed his house, and he was liable to be lynched if he didn’t flee the state first.  Harney wasn’t just a firebrand; he was in many ways a psychopathic monster. Although given how blissful he was at the prospect of starting a war with a global superpower over a murderer pig, you could probably already guess that.
I love this man. When he says the war would start over the border looking like this, or like this, the color of the islands actually do change.
The end might have been one too much America
37:14 Trump after seeing this:
Point Roberts. I hate it
ive binged all the episodes 3 times now lol
still waiting on punic wars part 3
😂 so that's why uncle sam unconditionally supports bizReal . They are doing what uncle sam did to the natives 😂😂
Crazy enough It's not going to be biden, but rather trump
He should make a vid on the Barbary war or the Mexican American war
This video aged very well, especially the end part.  This time it’s not Biden coming for Canada, it’s Trump.  Oh, the great U.S. state of Canada.
Trump will take a page from Putin's book and claim Canada _has always been part of_ the United States.
Well well well… here we are in 2024/25 and we’re about to see it with our own eyes
I can't believe its taken me over 3 years to realize that at 3:37 it says Density instead of Destiny XD
Who is here after President-Elect Trump joked about making Canada the 51st state?
3:32
The original Cuba crisis:
I just want to say the scene in the office was done brilliantly and I laugh indecently hard every time I see it❤
Donal Trump: Canada 🇨🇦 should be 51st state
37:12 well…
Just remember, you might have nukes & stealth tech, but Canada has Deadpool!
The drake part didn't age well but the rest of the end part BOOOY THAT AGED REALLY WELL FOR THE 51 STATE
I like how the pig turned into Morgan Freeman
Funniest thing is all those islands near Vancouver island are damn near uninhabitable and realistically are just a floating rainforest full of bears
There's probably a ton of examples when superiors were like "Use whatever force necessary to stop these guys. Oh, and also, don't start a war". Giving subordinates contradictory orders and being like "Not my problem. Whatever happens, it's not my fault".
did trrump watch this?
CANADA IS GONNA BE APART OF AMERICA LATER BOIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
37:18 well oversimplified, one simple reason for why not to invade Canada: its actions in WW1, and parts of WW2 (they're the reason why the Geneva Convention is long)
~Spudy has sonic shoes
We're making Canada the 51st state baby
Thank God, Pickett joined the South, the war may have turned out very differently, otherwise.
…straight line?
who else wants a Martin Luther king JR video?
Drake being president is no longer an option
37:52 that aged well
That ending didn't age well...
That was the worst speech ever Canada being USA 51st state sounds horrible
30:47
That ending starting to look very real rn
1:32 could still happen
31:04  I ducking knew this guy was a Simpsons fan. if you watch both you can really see it in his comedy style
38:11 BECAUSE TRUMP IS COMING BABY AND THIS TIME, HE'S COMING WITH A VENGENCE
36:58 Oh Canada! The 51st state of the Union! Dreams have never been more real 🥲
So, why did we fight for independence? Taxes? That's often sighted as a major reason. No taxation without representation and all. So what, we'll fight this war then the king won't tax us. Great but wars are expensive.  As soon as the war ended what did they do? They taxed you because of course they did. Really they had a better deal as British citizens. I know some of them might talk about high minded lofty ideals like not having a king but when it comes down to it, Americans just want a better deal. We should've stayed loyal subjects.
3:44
What a perfect description of Americans GUNS GUNS GUNS.
30:55 he didn't want wishes for some reason
Straight line?
bucanan might be my favorite oversimplified character
7:58 SHREK!
That ending aged like fine wine.
14:16 YEAHHH! I GOT MENTIONED!
Unbelievable
16:00 kinda funny how an American pulled out an AKM...
3:38  "ITS MY DENSITY!!" This joke was hidden in plain sight
5:20 All Endings: Oregon
7:59 the all star refrence was gold
Damn Canada might actually become the 51st state after all.
Jesus loves you repent he is coming back he died for your sins please ❤😊s
War  of  1812 is 😮
Ending might happen soon
I worked for the Hudsons Bay company in Northern Manitoba in 2022, 2023
The rant has aged well twice in '24
9:40 I was born near those islands lmao.
Im sure this conflict won’t cause anyone, to *DIE!!!* - Oversimplified
I think Trump was inspired by oversimplifieds rant at the end 😂
0:50 very great timing.
So, that speech might actually come true. Donald Trump just told Trudeau that if Canada can't survive without ripping off the US in billions when it comes to trade, they should just be the 51st state.  2025 guys.
The irony being Drake as president is no better than Bill Clinton. Biden didn't come for vengeance, but Trump told Canada to join and make Trudeau a governor of the 51st state 😂😂😂.
reasonable crashout
Oversimplified is the only channel I don’t skip the sponsors of.
Oversimplified dedicating an entire video to some disputed islands never mind when they were drawing the treaty the line went through the fucking middle of the islands🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
So in conclusion, we basically own canada as soon as we want to, i think we should meditate on this 🤔
Who is watching this video after trump mentions buying Canada 🇨🇦 🇺🇸
37:52 bro had a vision
37:22 what happend there?
Ah British vs ex-britsh/ex Europeans 😂
Yea I had to come back and watch the ending to this video 😂😂😂😂
Biden: Forgets to invade Canada  Trump: Fine I'll do it myself
37:05 it's happening not biden but trump everybody stay calm he called it first
he sounds a bit like the SpongeBob fish announcer in the  end
“President-elect Donald Trump joked at one point during his dinner with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday night that if Canada can't handle the economic effects of a punishing 25 per cent tariff on its goods, it should become the 51st state of the U.S.”          - shit this is getting real -
🎈 🤠                               /O—🖕       / 🛑.         🛑=🚼      🦵🦵
I hate biden
Aged like fine wine
I'd worry less about Canada's curves and more about your own curves, Donald.
Sorry Biden, but it looks like Trump is going to annex Canada for you.
that last was hilarious
Sooooo OverSimplified about Canada becoming America joke.
Thought I was gonna watch a summary of a pig in a crown bullying a squid over potatoes for several months, but this is still fun to watch
That ending aged like the finest of wines
Top ten most heated argument in history: Baaa-BAAA 🗣️🔥🔥
2 years later and here we are, trump threatening to make oversimplifieds dream true.
10:30 funny name😂
"Being Americans, they pulled out guns on him" as an American I completely believe this statement
Could you imagine level headed minds and desire for peace today with the wars going on… wouldn’t that be something
Murica' we're buyin Canada, that's it!
"whoa whoa whoa.. i didnt say they were white ppl" absolutely killed me more than it should have😭
"The Americans keep coming and they don't start coming they hopped into their wagons and hit the ground running!"- Oversimplified 7:57
Did you know Biden wasn't going to make a second term when you wrote this video?
0:45 😎
the drake joke did NOT age well
Is that the same Pickett of Pickett's charge? Explains a lot.
Bruh    38:18 seriously?
Canada: exists  Oversimplified: and I took that personally
Straight Line?
1 minute ago? Count me in. I also have a suggestion: maybe try the semi- high tier t-55amd
Can someone explain te curves joke at the beginning?
Me, a resident of the PNW: wow, I wonder the dispute of the Oregon territory is gonna work out
I’ve rewatched all his videos four times this year hoping it’ll make part 3 and 4 come out faster.
"One united nation, under our glorious president, Drake!" That sure aged well...
The British flags in the video are United Kingdom flags not British empire flags
OverSimplified - "Only a pig died!! Hurrah!!" Vegans - "ITS A PIG YOU MONSTER. THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN IT HAD WITH CHARLES GRIFFIN. THINK ABOUT ITS FUTURE GRANDCHILDPIGS!!!!"
BAAAAAAA!
Vietnam war<Pig war
So that’s where that meme comes from 18:40
That ending, bro. Best plot twist EVER. 😂😂😂
"i've got my spotted **** "blew up my mind bro
not gonna lie this part got me 14:00  edit: this part is also funny 33:29
How have we done this and not Vietnam??
Is that oversomplified at the end of the video?
Bro started spinning bars   😂
i love your vids
37:53 that aged fine
“FOR THE LOVE US GOD!” At 5:57😊
20:20 To add Harney’s list of ridiculous situations. He also had a group of 25 strong bulky slaves, that he sometimes would in provoke into beating up soldiers.
One word nato
Am I the only one hearing the end credits for the first time?
17:28 Hey who left this useless-ass fence to defend such a huge patch of potato crops here?! Hey, Porky! Get a load of this!
good morning kitten is closed btw
So in short America was; overly demanding, refused to compromise, overly aggressive and intensely lazy. The stereotype seems to be spot on in this case.
27:27 truly a masterpiece
heart warming that you include grampa zombie joe in another vid. im sure he would be thrilled, if he knew what day it was other than "time for french fries day!" LOL
The smash mouth refernce is crazy
One thing to note regarding Canada... It has _never_ lost territory, as a result of combat. In fact, if not _for the British negotiating_ at the end of the war of 1812, I'm to understand that Michigan would still be a Canadian property.  Nevermind the spicy history of war crime they are famous for.
Weridly enough history class didn't really touch on this 😅
5:57 yes I do
"That's a great plan. But there's no way I'm gonna agree to it"😂
Hi, Canadian here, you don’t want to mess with us during war time…
To-date, this video quite literally has the best ending in all of  YouTube lol
3:33  So thats why yhey call Florida thst...
Did transcontinental shipping go through Panama in 1859? Asking for a friend.
3:31 uhhh Florida….
0:44 Bro, a bunch of scalp carverving, child sacrificing, genocidal horse riders, are not, "people", per say...
lol biden wants health care and americans want poutine
i cant like this video enough
I loved this 😂.  And i mean.  Sense Creepy Uncle Joe The Child Pedo is out of office.  If the US really wanted to.  We could pretty much take over every other country and make it the United States of the World.  It would take all other countries teaming up, and that would just kinda stalemate the US.  But its highly highly highly doubtful with how many other countries it would take, that they would be able to get along long enough for them to edge out the war.  There have been quite a few videos where they have done the US’s military power and it really does take basically the rest of the world to equal us.  And also, pretty much no other country can invade the US even if it wanted to. Bo other country has enough ships to carry not just enough people, but enough tanks, planes etc over here to even try. And then, depending on where a country lands in the US. Will determine what kind of environment they will have to fight through to try and invade. And with the US being so big, and having many different environments from snow, mountains, plains to swamps, deserts and heavily wooded forests and everything inbetween. It just makes it near impossible.
37:58.  HELL YEA.  But also no, we can’t😭😭😭
0:46 He must have had the biggest balls to say that
"so while dont you cuddle- ME!" oversimplified,2022
5:52 but seriously, imagine you’re having an oddly coincidental conversation about online data safety when the guy you’re talking to rips off his skin and clothes to reveal a white figure with a normal human face and blue hair painted on its scalp smiling widely at you
Legends say The US still puts McDonald’s in the territory they occupy  And I’m lovin it
OMG
Bro you get more
It is all-star
I love history, but one thing I hate is that being half German half French cajun because people call me Nazi in Hitler
3:33 bro why does usa look like it has a schlong
Do not come! Do not come!!
Just watch this history class
37:47 that aged like a tomato left outside
In 1812 Britain was more concerned with napoleon marching on Moscow more so than our colony rebelling further over there
“You’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you guys are fine, and YOU TWO. Are the most mind-numbingly brain-dead dingdongs I’ve ever encountered in my life!” adding that gem of a quote to my vocabulary.
13:29 For some reason, that got me laughing.
In short, Americans are obnoxious, uncompromising maniacs with no concience except for their pockets, in a very American way... Meanwhile British, in a very _not_ British way, are surprisingly compromising...
Can you do a Oversimplifieid Potato War (Technoblade vs Squidkid?)
Umm    L
I love how the tourist steamer boat was named "Steamy McSteam Face".  Well played sir.
honestly Canada would wipe the floor in a defensive war against the United States (unless they Nuke us but then what's the point of the war)
Sorry not sorry, Natives lost a war of conquest. Cry about it
how is his not a mini wars?
Being British and part American and Canadian I dunno how I feel about the end bit 😭
20:00 huh. That sound familiar.
37:47 This Aged
Waiting for the new vid
BAAAAAA!!!!
Actually, when he says president Drake in the very end, it’s a call back to the Nord VPN. Add where they say people can look at your browsing history. The bottom result is Drake for president.
British troops coming to celebrate the Fourth of July is probably the single most wildly ironic thing I’ve ever heard
🇬🇧🆚🇺🇲
An Irishman made the white house
Americans really will do anything to avoid paying what they owe the Brits 😅  Brits were robbed
you dont talk about canada enough
3:38 oh nah why did they put Florida there
This video makes me proud to live in the Pacific northwest
that transition to the add is unmatchable
13:11 *aggressive baaa*
In short Pig
Too bad Oversimplified's dream will be ruined by Article 4
Oh no.. Run Canada!
14:29, not even the joker messes with the IRS.
Thank god America doesn’t have any more border issues…
We still want Drake as president
I mean literally, a PIG?????
Once Again, maybe the pig is just full of misfortune
In my opinion Griffon and his pig and Lymon and his potato is totally BS
Don’t invade please
I’m gonna unsubscribe to your channel for saying that😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

OH NO 3ed wave colonialism or neo imperialism. Canada hide!
Why is no one talking about preston brooks in this vid
37:53 More like: “My fellow Certified PDF Files” 💀
The drake remark aged like milk💀💀
Hey US we Indian need you as friends for a particular country canada 😂😂😂

37:10 bro crashed out
Average day in America: 4:11
if the US invaded canada back then the south would have won and the US wouldn't even get canada in the end.
President drake?

Raise your hand if you’re still waiting for Hannibal’s war pt3

VENGEANCE FOR PORKY!!
I've lived maybe an hour or two from the San Juan islands my entire life, and I had no idea about this.
3:57 Abraham... Abraham spoke to god. Ignorance isn't funny. If you're going to bring religion into this to poke fun of it, least you can do is be educated on the subject. Theology is a respected field in academics, might wanna look into it next time you wanna expose your atheism induced ignorance. Your hate for all things that other's find virtue in. Your deep seated problem with a father figure or authority. Your clinical depression that is only cured by more debauched actions increasing from the last.  Would you rather we slaughtered the natives for only money and land?? Who would you make fun of then?  Jesus wasn't happy, and told me to let you know.
32:31 You’re an idiot barrage
Do the Korean War next
37:53 that aged poorly
9:14 SPOTTED WHAAAT? I swear, the British STAYS making it easy for us to clown them. 😂
If any historical event fit the mold of Oversimplified it's this

Bro do 1812
The Hawaiians must have thought everyone mad for fighting over this piddly little Island
29:17 BUCHANAN!
I love how even though this story has nothing to do with Buchanan’s stupidity, OS still takes the opportunity to call out his incredible incompetence.
16:05  James Douglas: Noooooooooooooooooooo!! Me gets an ad for block blast.
welp, he's finally lost it.
Oversimplified is a comedic master class
4:13  IS THAT A MCDONALD'S
You tried in 1812 and failed bro
33:24 I almost freaking choked on the water I was drinking omg LMFAO
15:20 hey furious, I’m a oversimplified enjoyer

Fun fact: The Hudson’s Bay company is now American owned.
Drake being president... Let's hope  not 😏😑
3:55 am i the only one who heard someone in the crowd say "i hear voices all the time"
Oh no not porkchop the pig
I mean the rhyme was cool 7:58 and 11:31
27:30 I actually had to go full screen on 1080p to see the difference.  Well done.
BAAAAAAAAAA BAAAAAAAAAA 13:28
29:17 I’m not here! BUCHANAN!!
So this wasn’t like the 2,199,999 times that other nations expanded and it had nothing to do with skin color… got it. For some random reason, just this once, expansion was strictly racist. History!

David said way to go! Planning Canada invasion now.
Manifest destiny or as it should have been ready or not Indians here we come
7:58 *But the Americans keep coming and don't stop coming.* *Hopped in their wagons, and they hit the ground running.* *Didn't make sense to keep sharing Organ and made more sense to go to war again.*
Charles Griffin vs Peter Griffin.  Lesggooooo

33:29 this whole exchange was so good😂

Wait, I was one argument away from being Canadian? I’m on the west side of the Columbia river, like our home town is divided from west and east by the river.
7:58 didn’t know you had magnificent bar delivery

president drake aged too bad
37:49 Well that aged Poorly. -2024
Ngl i feel asleep watching this video because how beautiful Oversimplified voice on explain history is. 😭
Even the president of britain in the video is not safe from oversimplified
3:56  "I think it was Bill" "I thought it was Sharon's cat" "I hear voices all the time" 💀 ☠️ 💀
When he was ironing his shirt 😂😂😂
South asian history pls
Sex is what makes me wakeup
"I didn't say they were white people" -said by Oversimplified 😂
Certified lover boy? Certified pedophile!
"Our great leader Drake" aged so so so poorly
11:43 fun fact: Arthur griffin later went on to become an Irish politician, hoping to bring “home rule” (giving Ireland its own parliament) into Dublin. He was the man who got to do it in the end, despite the man before him doing all the work. Also, he lived very close to where I live. So have at it, London.
Wait, what?   I thought for sure you were Canadian this whole time! Had me fooled by some of the jokes in other episodes.
3:38 density
Hall Brenda Miller Sarah Hall Kimberly
Bruh it’s almost 11/5 Biden might not be president.
Why are the bros so stupid
Plot twist: The pig was an evil mastermind that pretended to die when he got shot so a war would start
4:11 accurate gta online gameplay
I just noticed that oversimplified has gone and edited the Drake part with "my fellow certified lover boys" at the end there.
obviously the best video ever
“I hear voices all the time” 💀
As a proud American why he said on 37:14 is posible (don’t take this offensively)
Glad those brave boys fought so that I could avoid showing my passport to some Canadian loser when I visit my awesome, sparsely populated islands.
Bro NATO would be pissed if Canada was invaded.
Im trying to find that joke "there is still hope for joe biden" also that ww3 meme he generated those countries leaders face was mad, now october 7, 2024 uncle sam is doing that hope and all is going agressive.
Take a shot every time he mentions who owns the islands.
The drake as president comment did NOT age well after the the Kendrick thing
6:51  End of advertisement for teachers
why do i feel like eurpoean history is more interesting as a canadaian i want to blame my ancestors for being boring
Can you talk about South America 38:16
I sometimes forget its not just the animation that takes time, but making sure the writing guides you through the story with nicely placed humour as well which takes time
2:40
As a patriotic American the end made me cry.🥹🥹
Lol "i didn't say they were white people", as if white people never expanded into territory owned by white people. Or as if native Americans didn't expand into each other's tribal territory. As if any race didn't expand into other races or their own races territory. Classic race baiting
Oooof ending aged poorly
I’ll keep that in mind hiding behind the curtain solves everything 29:15
7:59 funny
America's design, look at Florida and its position-
drake being president at the end.... please no hes gonna allow ped-
20:17  William S horny
Lol the mcdonalds
I'm watching Oversimplified cuz it's fun
I am never going to take email for granted ever again
I think this was just an excuse for OS to give us that ending speech, there ain't no way he just came up with that on the fly.
george me putting on a strip show
37:70 was prob the most american thing ive ever watch
9:19 "Northern Irish men love me" Who's going to tell him a few things..?
i feel threatened
Bro at the end just said RAHHHHH 🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅
considering how annexing ukraine has gone mostly unopposed by the world (here take stuff and money but nobody will help you fight) , we could honestly probably do it without too many repercussions.  Like sure treaties and defensive pacts nd shi exist, but lets be honest nobody would stop us, everyone would weasel their way out of whatever deal they have, or simply say fuck no we'll just break international law and pay a fine instead of agreeing to get shit on by america or starting a world war. sorry canada
the drake thing didnt age well lmfao
You know Biden would’ve easily been elected to another term if he delivered on Canada’s annexation. Guess we have to settle for Kendrick whooping Drake.
I’ve just been thinking, just leave the poor man and his sheep alone!
I love it if it is in history 33:28
I can't believe this was 2 years ago
이분이 그 약 빠시는...분?
Oversimplified Mexican American war
Bro just started monologing at the end. I'm not even Canadian but I'm still terrified.
Hey oversimplified, Biden/Kamala bc Kamala is running now when I comment. or Trump?
the drake part did not.... age well..
Iam from Egypt talk about it ok
9:19 Douglas go ahhhhhhhhh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The drake joke aged well 😂😂😂
Whats the song called when the Americans explode out the boat?
This Benjamin Franklin slander will not slide
0:54 “I didnt say they were white people” YAYYYYYY😂😂
😢😢😢😢 I am Canadian OHNO
Unc forgot to take his meds at the end
The patriotism that I felt at the end 😭
FOR AMRICA WE TAKE CANADA
ANNEX CANADA🗣🗣
37:53 aged like fine wine
I dont think anything has made me feel more patriotic than this youtube video
4:10 americans when there is a rumor about oil in that one area
The end brainrotted me
Lol invader always use " god destinated place for us" excuse for plunder and invade. And the joke religion all sin was wiped lol
Drake 💀
This show is the reason I sometimes think about YouTube Premium
Wait kanada❤🇺🇸
Buchanan 🤨🧐😒
The Drake joke at the end aged like milk
Ahhh yes love to see it racking a double barrel once again this time this double barrel has hammers to cock not rack, makes even more sense. I love the comedy of movies, animations, or any film, and ITS LOOOOOOVE FO SHOT GUNSSS YAHHHH.
9:18  13:06  13:28
That Drake bit at the end definitely did not age well
This is like my fourth time watching this and I just realized the pig sounds like Morgan freeman
Fun fact, we almost started a war over those islands, this guy can explain it better than me so go check it out, but long story short an American shot a British dudes pig since it kept eating his crops and despite the generals telling a very stupid general to not do something stupid, he did something stupid and ALMOST started a war over a pig being shot and killed
37:51 this aged well
7:56
Oversimplified   Just don’t  We are the reason the Geneva convention exists
Pickett seems to be a cannonball magnet in history.
3:38 it’s my density???
Hahaha little Back to the Future reference... Love it!
Thought this would be a war over the police
British Core: I OWN YOU
IM STARTING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE WORLD DESPISES AMERICA SOOOO MUCH…. LOL ID BE A SORE LOSER TOO!…!😂😂😂
manifest destiny does sound pretty gay
well, that drake joke aged badly 37:49
That’s the 13 red and white lines, 10 provinces and 3 territories, not the 13 originals.
From Wikipedia: Before the Pig Pig Military Escalation
This is why americans scare the rest of the anglosphere 37:00
5:53 "Then you my friend. Should use Nord VPN!"  "What the fu-"
I mean if you want to talk about Canada...there was this one time they invaded Russia.
Your House Of Parliament, UK (trademark 800 bc) representattion is spot on old chap 😂😂
I love how spuds got a face with eyes and Stalin and Hitler didn’t
So the Americans have been a bunch of nuisance since their early days of independence.
This sure did age
if we had a strong man for president…we would own can nan a da.
7:38 wtf lol
Reason why America wont invade Canada (yes ik am a nerd): They like being the good guy and protect other nations and dont wanna end up like Russia (no offense to any russians reading this) an invasion on Canda would make the UN kick USA out for hostile attacking :)
did oversimplified get too patriotic in this one
Drake is wild now
Will you let us Québec ?
the drake joke didnt age well
37:46 this aged not so well
The 16:28 part is gold 😂
That ending was LEGENDARY 😂
A moment of silence for Porky and Spuddy 🙏
Bro 😂 4:09
4:09 beards ain’t smiling
is the march you use for the americans appearing out of nowhere and scaring off douglas the liberty bell?
32:08 yeah we almost started WW1 years earlier then it started
33:29 i did a simaler sting operate a few months ago, it worked perfectly 😂
The Empire strikes pig
What a bloke this James Douglas guy was
Bro pissed off every Canadian at the end of the video 💀
Don’t want to offend anyone
Bro got kick off by natives bro had to bring guns cuz he’s American 😅
Why did he do the Irish man like that
Biden invade Canada?  Yea right… LOL
Now that I think about it, the British was trying to be as fair as they could when expanding their territory. It's just that the americans are greedy at the time.  Idk if that's the video portraying them like this, but the americans are pretty unreasonable here.
That end part aged poorly
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE PIG
I have lived my life NordVPN free for 33 years of my life, and so far no sleeper agent has come and murdered me but I am sure there is at least 6 other Me's somewhere in Wuhan China
GOD BLESS GREAT AMERICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
7:15 did James Douglas said spotted dick 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
😊😊😂❤ 🎉 😢😢😢   😂❤🎉😢😮❤😂🎉❤😂 😂🎉😂❤😂😂😂❤🎉
I feel like we don't give the Brits enough credit for stealing the flag pole on the way out, that might be the most American thing they learned in our time together.
7:57 epic
27:06
That last part with the parody of overhyped patriotism is spot on for overdone patriots.
Those two moments involving the US National Emblem song are some of the best moment of this series.
32:40 I’m surrounded by idiots
36:24 isl-ANDS
2 countries deciding the border: "straight line?" "straight line."
The greatest ending to a video in history of YouTube
37:53 did NOT age well
He really on convinced us to invade Canada 🇨🇦
The plushie looked like a snowman
Yes, still watching BTS videos with nordvpn
can we at least keep our parties and universal healthcare?
I Love How U Make The Pig Look like A Reaper.
War of 1812 was definitely not. The only reason why Canada isn’t part of the US is because of a pandemic at the time and the men were under a pandemic of Measles and Spanish flu. But this is also coming from an American 😅🇺🇸
That drake president joke didnt age well
The Drake comment didn't age well
fine you wanted a straight line fine here is your straight line yeeeeeehaaaaaaw!
7:57 all stars
I don’t know how to feel about the end cuz I’m from Quebec
37:50 certified pedophiles.
the only thing i will say 1 thing about Harney's "friends" one of them is the only president that I hated a certain Andrew Jackson
36:04  The absolute Irony. Because at the time, Britain was ruled by a German Royal house and still is to this day
3:36 would you look at that coincidence 🇮🇱

oversimplified watching the drake president part in 2024:
Touch my virgin maple soil and I swear the white house wont be so white, nor standing
Fun fact your bird vpn time is up
Biden= Pedo Drake= Pedo  Drake would fit in for president
Go to war? Nah, I'd rather sit around and watch OverSimplified while smoking pot.
4:10 this was unexpected
i was looking at the tiny islands and when they negotiated and i saw that it went through half so it both of theres
the drake as president joke aged like milk
Last 30seconds was the most excited oversimplified has been in his videos. Hope he never runs for office. Man would start a 3rd world war
Bro Drake vs Kendrick beef who told him
Drake for president is crazy
That drake thing aged well 😭😭😭😭
26:25 steamy mcsteam face
While his hope for Canadian invasion depends on Biden's coming with vengeance...Biden still has to decide which side of stage did he walk through
38:19 This is why Oversimplified should be president
13:05 😂
General Harney is so so much like Biden, trying to start a nuclear holocaust because of some God forgotten muddy regions in Ukraine. What is funny is that they will both be viewed by history with the exact same phrase:  ''A Laughing Stock''  & '' An Imbecile''
14:06  I actually looked this up and it’s true 😂
3:53 "it was a cat"
Recommending you to my history teacher thanks
37:22 But They Can’t Cuz Canada Is In NATO
So lyman was literally just The girl from gravity falls and the pig was his waddles
Canada is cold you Americans aren’t invading
1:52 Vietnam poster on table on the left
"I'd worry about your own curves Benjamin" got me cracking up
Sigh, I really wanted to use this for class. But too much questionable stuff.
Right, I’m British. I can say this USA stop bullying your brother okay? Leave Canada alone
"Being Americans, they pulled out guns on him." 😂
pope Gregory the v 9th declared war on cats
That's write Americans lock your doors, sleep with both eyes open at night, because NATO is coming baby
"Under the leadership of glorious president; Drake!"  Oh Oversimplified... 😦
Should have just reviewed the PS5 version which will be a majority of players will have
Straight line?
37:08 this video is banned in canada
Aye, you skimmed over that mole there.
Noice
Love the ending😂
{'-'}
38:29 don’t ask.
37:50 aged like milk 😅
I'm American but I felt fear for Canada at the end
I love how oversimplifying can leave out important stuff. I make no excuse for atrocities during a time when it was literally called wild, but Natives were given money, negotiated and ultimately made deals with the US. Some tribes resisted I don’t excuse it. But we wrapped this up. They have free territories within our nation. They have all rights and law on those lands. And they receive free college amongst a host of benefits. So IMO in the long run they made as best decisions and fights etc that they could for that time. Yet people need to stop trying to put responsibility on those who exist today. Enough. It’s history. If you need purpose go get slaves out of china and UAE etc. We don’t have slaves. Yes I know this is a history of it video. Ty.
Biden is too busy ruining the economy in America
well the end part showed you are the 2nd biggest american ever(1st is Soldier from TF2)
who else kind of sees a woman’s face on the american territory in 20:05
Bruh the idioticy of this general is giving me a harney-a
3:41 I think Agent Smith was right about humans being viruses in the first Matrix movie
Zambia kuchalo zoona!🥳... ne ichola wetata💰
No way he predicted the lyrics for "Not Like Us" (Certified Lover Boy, certified pdf)
Drake= president? not in 2024
20:00 Anyone here after the UK police thing?
No way he said drake as president 💀
1:00 (placeholder, void this)
Did anyone else notice the typo at 3:38? “It’s my density!”
Do not invade Canada please, we have the geese.
I'M YOUR TOP 1 FAN UR SO COOL THAT I WANTED TO KI- I mean hug🤭
"Biden's Coming, Baby." ☠️☠️
7:15 😂😂
1:24 😂
Ayo? Drake... ah 224 moment
The pig war never happened. It is a reason the Americans came up with, on why they took the islands! Also, I am canadian, and I am not proud of anything the Americans did. i hope you know that>:(🤬
Im sleeping with 1 eye open
This it's best clip! 7:24 12:05 12:55 13:13 33:22 33:29
I didn't say they were white people" is wild

Man...that drake joke at the end did NOT age well 😬
8:44
How did it take me a year to notice Pickett set his hair/ear on fire during the call…
IVADE CANADA
I love how he just threatened the entire Canadian population.
Drake be a certified pedo
Best video yet!
To quote a wise cartoon genie, "Canada's had it too good for too long"
All bro had to do was finish the fence.
That drake president joke at the end aged like milk
American empire vs Canada empire
awesome ending tho
29:11 😂😂😂
"our glorious president.. drake" aged poorly
Its pronounce like "wattcum"  (no hesitation, 1 word) county.
You should do the console wars of the 1980s - 2000s as a mini war
Do da Mexico-American war.
Having drake as president is crazy
34:08 her  majesty
10:23 This is accurate British politics...🤣
Best ending I've ever seen. However, you can see this is an old video because of the "Drake as president" thing 💀
The civil war video is 29 minutes. A war that started with a shooting of a pig 38 minutes.......
There is no way we made this hole thing up to justify imperialist tendencies.
20:20 general horny 💀
I like the Biden part😂😂
I appreciate still coloring the islands at 27:25 even though most people would get the joke and not bother to check the difference by zooming in, mad props
The issue was so sinple oversimplified couldn't simplify it further
That drake line aged like milk
37:52 boy did that age well
Given how long oversimplified goes now, I would love to see him do a remaster of his world war videos, given he clearly now has no problem going into further details. Would love an hour long version of world war 2.
Most i mean5
I  watch kost videos
3:37 florida?  Uhhh now I can't unsee it 😳
The island are british
15:29 mini
James Duglas, when yankees occupied the territory  Duglas: alright this cant get worse The second time Duglas: now i understand why you guys love guns (Takes out a shotgun)
It wasnt the british is was the canadians who burnt down the white house.
WHAT THE FLIP DID I JUST WATCH!!!!!
Biden actually walked the wrong way and ended up in mexico
If only he made more I watched every single video 2 times
Chill
“Our great American President, Drake!” Not the first time a US president would be a pedo
the end was fallout lore we just need the suits
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMERICA RULE THE WAVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m still waiting for the Vietnamese war
"certified loverboys" aged so poorly, but the Canadian rant was *chefs kiss*
the pig war happened in 1859 the exact year and I di the math and $100 in 1859 = $58,311.49 today
Looking back on Harney, I wouldn’t be surprised if good ol’ Joe was related to him. (But of course Harney being more capable)
37:51 hmmmmm
Thank god the America decided to never agre to eny ting and wanting to only go in a srtight line
Oversimplified: " WITH OUR GLORIOUS PRESIDENT DRAKE!!!!!!!!!"  Later oversimplified: "WATCH YOUR BACK CANADIANS BC JOE BIDEN IS COMING BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!!!!!!!!"
i love it when people in shows answer the iron
British: how about this nice FAIR deal Americans:no
my certified lover boys🤣🤣 bro predicted Kendrik Lamar's lyrics
America population: 360 million UK population: 60 million  They still outnumber the Brits more than 6-1
3:33 Florida 😭 America definitely expanded alright 😭
8:48  36:03
Douglas has a lot of non sense change my mind.
the channel is refering to the second one
13:28 BAAAAAA
37:49 aged not very well...
this video is as long as the shortest war in history lmfao
37:08
33:29
Don’t you mean Edmonton? Not Montreal
Your understanding of British things made me so proud one of crooked teeth fell out. (Thank you, from a British person).
37:51 That didn't age well, didn't it
So may things are out of context with this video 💀
Stay the fuck away from Canada
YEAH!! 🦅
Why don’t you make a video on the sub-Saharan slave trade?
7:54  all star
"I'd worry less abt Canada's curves, and more abt yours" 💀
the end it's a masterpiece! 😂
Canadian here. Sleepy Joe didn’t do shit!
Banger video.
3:42  This is still be done by some pesky rats in the middle est
4:12 Americans Being, Americans.
The Drake joke did not age well😂
In 18:13 reminds me of one of my dreams
The last part with him yelling about invading Canada is amazing. I love it every single time, and it just makes me laugh.  Although please don’t put Drake in charge…please don’t
38:18 Oversimplified: Talks about USA invading Canada very loud in front of 30M viewers This enraged his father, who punished him severely
Didn't you already try to invade Canada in 1812 and you failed mesirabely cuz the Brits held you back? Ending was funny though.
i'm at 37:00 heeeere it comes (| :
pazazz and zing. it always wins
not the curtain...
why does spuddy have SONIC'S SNEAKERS?
it is up to you to keep your potatoes  OUTTA MY PIG! yes... males sense
bad fence + Berkshire pig = bad combination. simple arithmatic
Yeah Biden’s not awake enough for that
Le the BTS vids
Hey, is over complicated your second chanel or is it a different person?
5:31 did anyone else notice that because they're flag is there door mat they constantly are showing disrespect to there country by stepping on it every morning?
I will send you to jesus
But you said no
Dis no one noticed BOOBIES on the calculator?
21:56 I love the save our bacon😂😂😂😂
"I thought it was Sharon's cat"  "I hear voices all the time" lmao gotta love the crowd dialogue😂😂
I'm actually suspicious that Canada intends to invade us, I mean the vast majority of their population lives within easy driving distance of the boarder. Think about that......🤔
That ending gag got a lot funnier these past few months given who our glorious president is in his proposition
all of 37:17 to 38:16 i dont care about because there is no reason to do it
God chosen people, settlements, expanding territories,  killing native population hmmmmmmm
I will eat 100 forks  Edit: IT IS DONE.
1:25 nah he was a savage💀
8:43 nobody noticed that vietnam map?
My favorite ‘wa!’ in history
im watching this on vacation in canada and the end had me on edge bro
the drake as president thing did not age well
Bruh, clone wars thumbnail
MAYUCDOANALDZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
A war about a pig for 38mines not on my oversupplied bingo
The ending is so real
You just told us that maple syrup is better than any American food and that Banff is better than any American national park.
"And our president, Drake!"  Ooooh..... That didn't age well....
I don't know what's more disturbing the last minute of this video or Oversimplified looking directly at me
32:00 the pig here made me laugh way to hard
me, a resident of one of these disputed islands watching this: 😮
oof that drake line at the end is uh... not aged well
That Drake comment didn’t age that well 💀
Make it Kendrick
The Pig war incident probably explains why the same general, general Scott, that resolved it was so cautious in the American civil war.
33:00
being american  he emerged from the tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife  average american sunday morning
bro spent 2 minutes planning on invading canada
This is the funniest oversimplified video
Hey hey hey...if you look at European history, the fact that there were white people inhabiting nearby territory never prevented other groups of white people from invading and conquering that territory.
The Biden part really didn't age well
27:25 things I would fight over about with brother when I was a kid
ending. was. AMAZING!!!!!!
7:55 all star
To summarise…..Americans just don’t try to make an effort which starts problems 😂
Rap part is at 7:58
It's okay you guys. We lost a war to emus and a bunch of other animals.
" But the Americans kept coming and they don't stop coming,    hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running,    Didn't make sense to keep sharing the Oregon,    When they outnumbered the brits more than six to one 🗣 "                                                                                                                                                 -Oversimplified

Are you serious
Income depends of how hard you work. It's not 100% true in trading. Here income depends of how much do you think
This is what happened in fallout
10:33 wild 💀
The drake joke didn’t age well…
You shot LazerPig! He was just trying to get the potato water!
The end had me
31:03 the pig’s voice does sound an awful lot like qui-gon now that i think about it…
"One united nation, under the leadership of our glorious president; DRAKE!"  Normally, I'd say that aged poorly, but considering how US presidents tend to be, I'd say that's actually spot on.
37:53 wow that aged…. Horribly
Buchanan was the worst president and yet they named a drink after him
2:33 "have you heard of the war of 1812?"
Why did an American guy have a soviet AK-47?
That Drake refrence did not age well...
Not a fan of the anti-American sentiment in the video. Idk who needs to hear this, but Native Americans stole land from each other for hundreds of years… so did every other group of people.
President Drake is a joke that definitely didn't age well, lol
this style of ad approaching is ironically way more annoying than just advertising really quick
He is encouraging USA to invade Canada. Ohhh, that is propaganda
This is just further proof that the stupidest conflicts are the most complicated due to the lack of brain cells
Now there killing the beavers and making hats out of them. Higher beings: omg, what are we going to do with them? Jesus christ. Someone show them thats not good.
Thomas Jefferson: "we secured our independence from the brits, now to expand westwasrds." some random guy: "umm, Thomas, it looks like a bunch of different people already LIVE out west." cabinet: **GASP!!** Thomas Jefferson: "WHAT?! OH HO!!! THAT MEANS WE CAN'T EXPAND!!!!" cabinet: "aaaaaaaaaaaw." Thomas Jefferson: "I HATE MY LIEF!!!!!!!!!" that same random guy: "whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't say they where WHITE people."  **tense silence**  "YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!"  me: **face slaps really hard**
Not president drake!
Definetly one of the sillier videos and I'm all for it
I fricken love this channel. I've rewatched these videos so many times that I can freely quote em anytime 😂   You guys need to do The Banana Wars. I'd love to see your take on the complexity and insanity of that whole time period
Aww man. I thought this was going to be about the economic war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.
Now the performance of the year, 1816 AD, by James Douglas, Brit Star! 7:56 Somebody once told me the 'Murcians gonna roll me, they ain't the sharpest tools in the shed.  They were looking kinda dumb, with their finger, and their thumb in the shape of an L on their forehead!  Well, the Americans keep coming, and they don't stop coming! Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running.  Didn't make sense to share Oregon, they outnumbered us more than 6 to1! So much to do, so much to see, get rid of that Manifest Destiny. You never shine if you don't go, you never shine if you don't glow! Hey now, you're a Brit Star, get the war on, go play! Hey now, you're a Brit Star, get the war on, get paid!  Cause all that Brits make is go-old, only British rifles make the mo-old!
The British empire really didn’t need those islands when they were the biggest empire ever. Why would they need such small islands?
me and the DDT are also the A.U.S.T. [ANTI U.S. TEAM]
plz listen to the DDT
BUCHANAN!
DDT: THINKING OF Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombing   Oversimplified: Pigs, anyone?
never been so happy to be american with four guns and a big knife that I carry every were
This is the funniest video ever!😂😂😂😂
Oh yea ur right they weren't white people💀
7:57 I didn't realize Oversimplified was a fan of Smash Mouth
Er, Gretzky did wave the American flag while playing for the Kings and Rangers.
38:06  I've never been so proud to be American
32:31 You're an Idiot x5
There’s a lot of issues with this. I’m from the United States of America, but I do have some sympathy of Canada. no matter how weird that they love ketchup popsicles. They’re obviously a peaceful country.
5:52 "So u should use... NordVPN!" "what the fu-"
bro grew a third leg at 3:34
31:00
I love that when American is ever we're and also sa McDonald's is there too 😂😂
33:24 is a scene that invokes the feeling of hatred that can be only described as “I am tired of your bs”
100 dollars in the 1850s would be equivalent to about $3500 dollars today, or about 3 times the cost of a full Berkshire pig’s worth of meat.
ur not my fav youtuber now
37:53 did age well
That Drake reference be aging like milk
20:40 "He hated superiors, and hated being told what to do-" THEN WTF DID HE JOIN THE ARMY THEN????????????
Hey Oversimplified, I know you're probably not gonna' see this comment but your content means the world to me! I've been watching your videos for like 2 years now and even though I've pretty much watched all of it but it never gets old, your practically the reason I love history so much and without you I think the only thing I'd be extremely passionate about would be dinosaurs. Thank you so much for getting me through some pretty rough times. Hope you see this comment, thank you.
Griffin's pig:Eats potatoes from Lyman's garden  Lyman: So you have choosen death?
HAve to take slight offense, sure portray Americans however but you WONT show the brits as tea drinking cowards?
The ending is Crazy
37:53 🤣
I’ll tell you what, I can be doing something absolutely random, and I’ll randomly think “ALL RIGHT, YOU PSYCHOPATH. I’VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS” and it will make me laugh every time regardless of the circumstance.
dont you dare invade canada im from canada i subrsibed but you dont treat me back????
I love over simplified
"Then you, my friend, should use NordVPN!"  "WHAT THE FU-"
Canada💀💀💀
Guessing the Steamship was “Steamy McSteam Face”
Dude please make more videos faster. great job
Who knew Oversimplified was like that 37:28
harney seems like a failed napoleon
"what a beautiful unspoiled corner of the british empire." and hes got his WHaT!!?!

Thank god they were only godless Indians they haven't spoiled all the resources love us some oil

3:31  he even got puberty
President Drake was assassinated by Kendrick Lamar.
Lmao Biden shit himself during the D-Day ceremony this year
As an American I want to be offended by this absolute roast against Americans but....he's right.
All fun and games until Canada forgets the Geneva Convention
Great video!
Charles Griffin lost 34 gigabytes of ram and he  totally had 34 gigabytes of Ram any can run Ubuntu on a PC not even windows XP or not windows 10 and 11
I know it has been two years since you released this but I found this to be the funniest one yet. I love how educational this is yet it’s incredibly funny and I can tell you had a lot of fun making this.
3:38 WAS THIS A BACK TO THE FUTURE REFERENCE⁉️⁉️⁉️
Oversimplified is so handsome … I’ll go out with you cutie 🤭🤭😩😩
Out of pocket…. I LIKE IT 👁️👄👁️👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽🦶🏽🦶🏽
Most stupidity patriotic video seen

26:47
Avoiding civil war
The last channel because. The british should own it
"But the americans keep coming and they don't stop coming." I know, Oversimplified. I know. (Someone said oil? Have some FREEDOM!)
37:50 kinda focked…OVERSIMPLIFIED I HIGHLY ADVISE YOU TO EDIT, RETRACT, & INCINERATE THE SCRIPT & STATEMENT! 😂😅👁️👁️
It was a War Without Reason 😔
I love how he's made longer videos on the Pig War than on WWII
Do a war of 1812 video or else
It’s not like the travelling to Canada all the way to watch a video 6:36
Request: Albert Einstein - OverSimplified

That last vengance was a sneak peek to the punic wars :O
More pls
5:15 Fl@t e@thers when donut earthers
All entire video:😀. End:💀💀💀
CERTIFIED LOVER BOY🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Everyone agree that oversimplified became too American
"THE GREATEST AMERICAN PRESIDENT, DRAKE"   that did not age well
This is my favorite video on the entire channel, followed closely by the Second Punic War parts 1 & 2
I think I’d prefer it if Canada invaded the usa and I live in fucking Georgia I just hate the fact that the only thing the usa can do is win a war and it utterly fails and basically everything else
15:55 China’s opinion on Taiwanese independence
Please do more US West history. Lewis & Clark?
Deus Vult is back babyyyyy!
5:52 I Dont Use Nord VPN .__.
cool
is there any historical records of the 'customs collector's' name?
Objection! That’s clearly the House of Commons. No Lords, Piddlington or otherwise, in sight!
Britain: say's something logical    American:that seems like a logical explanation but I WILL NEVER AGREE TO THAT,"pew, pew, pew, pew"
Seeing this video makes me forget what the US looks like
Ew not rats or disease
Yes. It is our destiny to spread from sea to shining sea to shing sea to shining sea. Canada isn't enough. We need to spread south too.
lol the end tho
lol the end tho
3:32 florida lookin kinda suspicious

Please upload again I’ll join skill share pleaee
21:07 Why does the wind powered boat have exhaust
7:57
last time america tried invading us in the war of 1812 we attacked back nd even burned down the whitehouse. even tho no land was eschanged and there was technically no winner we still burned down your capital building. thats like if britain attacked france and the french revolted and ended up burning down the royal castle. and if you think we wont fight back may we remind you of what we did to the germans during world wr one. canada doesnt do war crimes but after a war were in there are more laws
Canadian
How did they get 2 Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bombers?
You should do Michigan and ohios dispute over Toledo
5:55 "what the FU-"  is my favourite line 😂
Fallout 4 combat shotgun btw on the mice hands 3:42
... WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
36 years and i never noticed the straight line 😆  and the crowd talking "i hear voices all the time" is pure comedic genius
5:57 WHAT THE -
“Being American, he emerged from the tent with four pistols and a big knife”    wait you missed the shotgun, the fifth backup pistol, the huge katana, the ak-47, and thne secret stash of EVEN MORE GUNSS  but it sounsd about right.
personally, i dont think anyone would be oppossed if the USA too the tip of Ontario
being american he emerged with 4 guns and a huge knife the average american child before a school shooting
Do the British Civil War
Heh, drake.
:(
don't talk like that!
hey i'm a Canadian
All of the people who did the Nord VPN most likely don't have it anymore
If this guy ever become a teacher, Make this guy an History Teacher (AP)
This aged horribly
Calling the war of 1812 a draw is the most American thing. America started the war to annex Canada, which they failed, the only reason America wasn't punished was because britain didn't care enough.
I wonder If the Americans who live on these Islands structure their culture around this dispute.
3:12 is Astromech droid? I watched a lego star wars army building and the time stamps were put here so now 2:48  is apparently Astromech droid time
3:36 just want to say this is called “Manifest Destiny”
Notice a cirtain part of America between its legs
OUR GLORIOUS PRESIDENT BBL DRIZZY!!!
29:10  seems like buchanan has been a wreck since william rufus king died...
“Biden’s coming, baby.” -Oversimplified
I guess healthcare *is* cheap when one of the most common outcomes for an annual checkup is to have Low Tier God quoted at you.
Ahhhhhhhhh
28:44      29:18
that smash mouth reference was fucking peak
awesome
i am in israel?!  אני מישראל
37:50 yikes, this didnt age well

Bro casually said to have s3x with him 💀

37:53 aged like fresh milk
7:57 i don't know why but i really love this all-star bit thank you oversimplified
Why haf thy British bretheren wear thy monocle it be truly un racifying
11:07 just for myself
CANADA BELONGS TO AMERICA RAAAAAHHHH 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
37:53 probably not
Man that drake scene aged like dogshit
This is best channel in whole YouTube.
4:20
37:25 canda is in nato so even if it would be unlikey

Lmao, the ending started to sound like the news caster from spongebob getting angry at canada xD
I think he has some personal problems with canadians
That drake comment aged like horse shit
8:32 You are so sore, worry worry, see you know me American American, so foolish😊 so so soon and you so so
pig
Don't ever let British draw a line on your map
I’ve been to the memorial statue for the pig who perished. I was having a deeply emotional experience while the rest of my family looked on, questioning my sanity.
"oh no, not the curtain again Mr. President"
I’m going to be honest, I’m a Brit and I saw the U.S as a pest to the British who obviously deserves the islands, but it would be interesting to see this on the American side of the the g
37:23 why not?
7:14 Why
imagine this really happened. like what kind of idoits do you have to be  to allow  this    to ha ppen
30:10 Jackson looks more like John C. Calhoun
I didn't say they were white people 😂😂 sad but funny at the same time
is the pig Al Capone?!😮😅😂
The mini cold war. The warm mud war.
“Woah woah woah, I didn’t say they were white people… YEAAAAAAAAA (pulls out whip💀)
No USA
NATO: take my water
25:00
Bro did douglass dirty while he's pooping 😂
you killed our pig we take your pole 36:23
So funny I'm literally wheezing “u-s-eh?”🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was all of Buchanan's presidency in a nutshell
So not how I learned it in school. So awsome, thanks for the hard work.
bro do more of these pls !!!
These white people sure love beaver :D
3:32 america grow a penis!?!?!?!?!?
20:10 is a hoot.
Scared of this pig guy bro
If Harney never officially joined the C.S.A. During the Civil War it seems really improbable his motive was to fracture the United States, He even stopped Missouri from seceding. I just think he was power hungry 😂
SCAM! When I saw the title “The Pig War” (plus the v cute juvenile cartoons),  I was half expecting the angry birds vs pigs.
7:15 What did he just say!?!?
38:08 Listen here Yankee,don't mock me for my insomnia,or I will come to your address ..................    DANG IT,HE USES NORDVPN
😂😂😂
Bro really spent 15 minutes in Hitler and spent 40 about a pig on a worthless island.   WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE VEITNAM
"I hear voices all the time" 😂😂😂 it's the subtle humour I love
My heart started to beat a little bit too fast at the end there... I didn't realize how susceptible I was to that sort of propaganda... we're coming.
European countries: Let us just draw our borders in a perfect balance, so that it can follow rivers and mountains. USA: *S T R A I G H T  L I N E*
When I read pig war I instantly thought of techno blade vs squid potato war.
You do lovely voice acting. Also  you can do very nice voice when you but emotions in it
The natives were just making little teepees and letting the land go to waste  Some of them built structures but the only cultures that built structures were very barbaric and bloodthirsty
Tghjjkkk 😂❤❤❤🎉😢😮😊457766 days till I go 😅 but still no one 1️⃣ to be honest about this guy is my favorite player of my team but we will be happy 😊 happy 😊 and thank him so very kind to him for this year so happy 😁 😊
imagine we actually had canada, it would be awesome:)
*aggressively yeehaws at you*
"Native" americans were closer to animals than Europeans
33:29 live laugh love oversimplified giving men random girly screams
That speech at the end is terrifying.
5:56  do it also 7:15
The British could have just  damed the river then would have had the whole thing
Did i just watch this to find out a pig was killed 🐷
0:37 is a stretch  The west had hundreds of millions of acres of land completely uninhabited
I am here from Canada and I am scurrrred.
10:33 nah the 7th earl of WHAT?
bro was doing all star🤣
I just realised 8:00 is a goddamn Shrek 1 reference
14:36 made me start giggling lol
"the American kept commin, they didnt stop keep coming" nah💀💀💀💀
I swear that is Morgan Freeman 31:03
I felt bad for the pig no offence but that american guy should built better fence and can you please make philipine revoution simplified
That is the best ending to something I have ever seen.
The most unhinged ending to a history video I've ever seen
7:57 oversimplified is gonna become a singer
It must have been so weird for England to be like "Oh man lets not go to war again with that place we used to own!"
This is, by far, the best video of OverSimplified. Sometimes I open and listen the ending bit just to get motivation.
Americans: we didt start the problem Brits: not us Americans then who? The pig: WAHAHAHAHAHAHA
“Drake as our president!” 😂😂😂😂 had me dying for 10 minutes straight for no reason
16:33 Brooooo😂😂😂😂
10:27 lol😂😂
31:03 was that Morgan Freeman?
Mole! Mole! Mole!
thanks for making all those videos
Thanks!
"Pretty much a draw" pfff the war of 1812 did not end in a draw. America got ass clapped.
That speech was so emotional 😭 😭😭😭
Great video! However one small thing... We Canadians are the number 1 leaders in War Crimes... Come and get us;)
An Irish man who loved a pig.   CLASSIC IRELAND!
7:36 the city of independance got me laughing
10:39
29:18 BUCHANAN!!!!!!   Yeah pretty much the entirety of his presidency 😅
7:57
btssssssssssssss
How can an island, that is the reason for a dispute between the British and American, 2 English speaking nations, have a Spanish name ='D
this may be my favorite os video
7:29 16:31 37:25 WELCOME TO AMERICA MOTHERFUCKAS!!!!!!  Damn, Bro! 10:26  Bro must be the ancestor of Peter Griffin. 11:45  Harney: How about I don't, anyway? 32:50
"i didnt say they were white people" *cheering*
typical America
Can you add the mongol conquest next
0:24 6:54
0:30
Honestly I love these vida
The when the USA ate the burger florida looked like a pp
Ohhh, it’s that Pickett!
There was war against American cops,,,
10:56 lol
youve helped this dropout more than you could ever know. thank you oversimplified, i truly love these and need more.
I'm a Brit
"But being American he emerged from the tent with four pistols and a giant knife"
*War over a pig* also me who had a war over a notebook
I thought after he said they weren’t white people I thought it was a Mexican pig joke
3:38 it’s my DENSITY lol 😂
People in 1812: manifest destiny rules!!!  Me in 2024: y'all humans are EFFED!!!!!
I do not hail Hitler
WW1 vibes rn
PIG
KNACK 2 BABIEEEEEEE
I love all the references to so many things most of all. Like: Star Wars reference in thumbnail, All stars reference at 7:57 (song), ect. And it was very funny and a nice vid. Keep it up!  Like if u agree: 👇
NICE VIDEO, CONGRATION!
everyone know that!
canada are the best, because the american are suck to invade our country...
5:56
Why do this to Canadian people.
I find it hilarious that at 16:00, the US guy pulls out an AK-47, a Russian gun. It's just really funny with today's political climate.
2 years later this is still my favorite video
Jesus Christ the final but had me crying 😂😂
hey oversimplefied can you do anchient egypt vid please im subscribed
7:58 sounds like a song but I can’t get my finger on it🧐
Maple bacon pancakes, oh yeah 👍
Your transitions into ads are well done.  I keep watching rather than skipping ahead.  I hope they're paying you extra for that. 🙂
Ay yo  man the ending was enjoyable.
Canadian viewers:You dont talk about canada enough in ur videos!!! Meanwhile polish viewers being mentioned just once in ww2 episode
I can over simplify it even more,  "A little piggie went into the wrong hood and got smoked"  Bam
1:14 Mind your own curves Ben 😒😒😒
I grew up on lake of the woods so it's super dope to see it in an oversimplified vid!!!
As a canadian i do not approve the end (please)
26:08:  Something about how “hastily” this was animated cracks me up.
5:58 good morning what-
25:08 "Oh I'm sorry. Is that too much too ask? Princess!"
I've watched this video so many times and it just occurred to me to question who made the laugh track for 19:22 😂
School presentations are a lot easier all of a sudden...        Dw Oversimplified, you're mentioned in the sources ;)
7:57-8:07 masterpiece
"I'm sure this won't cause anyone to DIE"
Of course Harney was good friends with Andrew Jackson. OF COURSE HE WAS! Apparently Jackson was just as reckless and foolhardy, he was just more successful in all his shenanigans and, much like Harney, had friends in high places.
22:05:  I love how part of Harney’s plan was to willingly have his CO and his soldiers blown up and later have them assist in taking the islands like nothing happened to them.  I think if there’s anything that we can agree on here, it’s that General Harney was an Idiot. 👍Like this comment if you agree.
I accidentally paused at the “video unavailable” part of the video, and my squirrel brain was so confused until I realised
Watching my daughter and the threatening ending came up and she questioned, “What in the world was that!” Great until the end though. Horrifying to threaten war even as a joke.
im canaden and i'm subscibed.
"It's my density!" 😂
Dis iz da unieted shtates ov 'merica
Napoleon:Hey want this landfor money Anerica:Sure why not?
Did you guys see tye secret at 38:43 ?
I just saw the rant... and it deeply disturbed me...
The portrayal of Sir James Douglas is too white. He was born in Barbados to a Scottish father and a free black or mixed-race Barbadian-Creole woman.
Tried that in Australia with the " Yes " vote
Bro I downloaded a vpn and then he said the blocked by country and because I was connected to Canada I thought they blocked the video
3:53  "I thought it was Sharon's cat.."  "I hear voices all the time."
“AND THERES NO WAY IM GOING TO AGREE WITH IT” pulls out a Soviet ak-47 “Oops. Wrong time…”
bro really be preppin the next speech for biden when voting comes loma
great speech
"Lyman, Fucked the pig."
are you American or Canadian
Imagen if a war was started by some pig on an island and a dumb general
I find it funny how he decided to do a history remix of All Star lol

i kinda feel sad for griffin
Just wait till you get War Criminal Canada then you’ll lose no matter what
Honestly, every incident between Britain and the USA makes me root for the British.
Lol that ending was awesome XD
37:08 timestamp for myself
I swear if I’m the only person that sung all star after that joke I will me pissed
I’m a scared Canadian now
“Well that would be a fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties…  And there’s no way I’m ever going to agree to it!!!” -Oversimplified
why am i just watching this this is fire
As a Canadian, I think Americans don’t realize we have a lot of bombs like a LOT of bombs- ;-;
So OVersimplified wants USA to invade Canada. What a propagandist.
And who was it who spoke to God? (Among the muffled voice) "I thought it was Sharon's cat." "I hear voices all the time." Also need to find out who this Sharon is. She also comes up on 2nd Punic War as a Truth or Dare crush.
Look I’m American but chill out I got Canada’s back
I went to Google Maps mid video to see how it ended.🤣
The whole US plague shouldve stopped and shouldve never become a thing
why does that pig at 12:17 look like the pig from Gravity Falls :)
and ty for all the vids
he lives in the uk
Day #2 of asking you to do irish history
The time old story of the reasonable and fair vs the racist and radical.
3:54 "I hear voices all the time" xD
9:20 goddamit its very funny
The ending was…Beautiful 🥲
Dear Oversimplified. I think you might be interested in the history of Beaver Island, Michigan. A large island in lake Michigan where the leader of a breakaway religious sect crowned himself king and got into a fight with the u.s. military.
I’m Canadian so am I American when my country gets invaded
PLEASE READ MY COMMENT!!!!  Hey buddy don't care about an update for another amazing video I really just want to check in on you ❤👋  I love you your an amazing person and I'm also going through some stuff but WE GOT THIS!!! 💪🤜🤛
"I would worry less about Canada's curves and more about yours" at the start of the video was legendary
That is amazing.
glad i watched till the end legendary outro☺
3:38 *hol up*
Bro started tweaking at the end😂
that pig is just waddles from gravity falls???
“It’s my density-“
Oversimplified make videos about India pls
nice ending
This is the reason why I love history
Nice.
Day #1 of asking you to do irish history
Please do irish history
Trust me you'll find irish history very interesting
How about irish history
Does Oversimplified have a team or is it just him? If not, we need to get him one. :)
What do you mean "be Americans, they pulled out guns"? Only 42 percent of Americans own a gun, less then half!!
32:36
"Then why'd you sign it, you marshmallow" is exactly how I feel about the American government.
10:57 Yeah! Mole! Mole! Mole! Mole!
Lmfaooo the last 2 minutes was gold 😭😭
We shall unite the entire continent and call it the United America
LOL - That Biden thing didn't age well. I doubt he even knows where Canada is.
Go down the middle of the islands
Them celebrating  The 4th of july when it was when the brits went for peace against us
War over a pig 😂
He hes american
14:29 out of context
3:34 I wish i had that
0:14 What if i make one in the winter🤔
3:50 If I recall, the idea of it being approved by God was in tandem with the fact that forces have not stopped you from doing it.  That's why the phrase " God is dead" eventually became a big thing, because it was saying that our culture needed to and was changing, and that your ability to do something was not proof that God was allowing you to do it.  (To be fair, many people today still have this opinion, thanking God for their success, believing that it is because of him that they were able to do what they have done.)
blud sang all str by smash Muth in 7:56
37:15 everybody sleep with one eye open no matter what country you are in oversimplified is invading
The moose will get you first
😮🥱👍
18:45:  And so, history was made once again.
As a Canadian, the ending to that video had me on the floor crying of laughter LOOOOOL. Bidens coming baby and hes coming with a vengeance!
19:00 one of the funniest scenes, as soon as he hears “kill your pig”all he hears is the flash bang noise 😂
Drake stop ✋
Just had to add some liberal porn at the end?
34:33 music
It mirrors the times we're living in now. Stop the occupation in Palestine and give back Gasa to the Arab people.
At 9:30 I think the treaty refers to the middle channel.
This video is idiotic, good job commie.
Bro was furious about his pig
7:55 i cant unhear the all star remix
3:38 said its my density
I am from Moose Factory, ON Canada. A Cree of the Moose Cree First Nation (Swampy Cree). My Uncle through marriage came from Scotland to work for the HBC here on the Island when he was 20 years old (many moons ago). I worked for the North West Company as a manager.
All i heard was INVADE CANADA
I love his Benjamin❤️🤣
Please nogh anah-mah-cah ,nogh
As an American, I feel like I owe alot of apologies...
This is click bait it's been running over and over again for the last week
That last part wasn't acting. He genuinely meant every word he said 💀
The last part just made me laugh histerically
wait isnt he canadian
7:57 why does that go together so good....
Oh, I’m sorry. Has your country ALSO never lost a war.
"Biden's coming baby" favourite line out of the whole video
0:47 based
7:20 the part where they set up a McDonald’s,s was so hilarious
Ok this video is just funny😂😂😂
31:06 what an idiot he could respawn his potato and still have 2 wishes
7:58 he just start sing all stars on history video
37:47 Oversimplified knew years ago that Drake had the Manpower to be President.
The ending was not expected
In my case, it would be a 3d war. If it were a 4th war, yes it is. I've never heard of this guy Hitler before, what a bad guy. Simplified or unsiplified, yeah. A dog war is more like it, it should be. Insane battle between Germany vs America, I didn't see it coming. War this year against Russia and Ukraine, let's find out
this video is hot garbage
God bless America
4 minutes in and i remember why i unsubbed and stop watching.
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i dont understand.
31:02 Lyman. If you spare me, i will grant you 3 wis-  *shot*  MUAHAHHAHAH
32:31-32:45
Can't wait for the sequel where OS begs presidents Trump not to take his advice
Canada, your actors are famous because of US
Best channel ever.❤
17:22 is just perfect
7:58 Is One of Oversimplifieds Best Rhymes With All stars 😂
They should've named it the pig-potato wars. Technoblade would've been proud
Bidens to old to invad canada
4 days after this video, many died in mayfield kentucky  this is what happens to your brain after meteorology interest and history interest
7:57 Oversimplified knew what he was doing 😂
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -Matthew 6:19-21
7:25 16:27  song name?
bro remembered he’s murican at the end lmao
This is awesome, I grew up in Seattle and went to college a bit north of Seattle near the Canadian border. I've been to the San Juan islands a bunch of times and had no idea about any of this history 🤣
3:53 'i thought it was sherman's CAT!' best part
paying for a vpn is fucking crazy, like its literally just a free service with the openvpn client, anyone who pays like nordvpn or something of the sorts must have a mental disability
37:18 let’s hope this man doesn’t run for president one day
typo - "its my density". But i am I... and should shut the hell up
"strait line?" "strait line"
"Being an American, he emerged with 4 guns and a knife."  This is very accurate.
9:06 is that the ghost of Tabor vault sound 😂
4:00 wayyyyy 😂😂😂😂😂
1:22 haha 😂
I just noticed that Spuddy is wearing Sonic the Hedgehog’s shoes!!
37:21 he's gone crazy
War is like chess: it's so easy in retrospect, but everyone is completely stupid and everything goes incredibly badly.
Please invade Canada it sucks up here
16:01 Equators Gonna Equate
2:03 21:25
The argument with the sheep had me rolling on the floor and then arguing with the Brit in sheep language had me dead 😂😂😂
Minecraft dog situation ahh near-war
why this shi 38 minutes dawg
7:57 it sounds like he's singing
I said “straight line” at the exact same time the first guy did, PERFECT
As someone who was born in Oregon and raised in Washington, both of which used to be part of Oregon Country, this hit especially close to home!
25:21 Im learning this song! Ice been doing for weeks! Habanera
37:25 plot twist: he had to research this topic to go off on his Canadian manifesto
33:30 me to my bully during my senior year
There are many languages but this man time and time again chooses to speak facts
16:10 - 16:40:  This entire part makes me laugh every time I see it. It’s just that funny.
About that affordable insulin thing…
*KING CRIMSON!!!* 6:53
Why….
6:35 magic like button
Imagine his neighbors when he recorded the final rant about Biden coming with vengeance 😂😂😂
11:07
It wasn't the white house that got burned down it was the capital that got burned down x2 (Albany Ny)
I can not stop thinking about the ending rant of this video. “Watch your backs. Sleep with one eye open tonight. Because Biden’s coming baby. And this time, he’s coming, WITH A VENGEANEEEEEEEE”
This was so good hahaha
30:19 CaseOh is going to sink that ship 😭
To Canada... I apologize on behalf of our stupid leadership.....
Hi
Usa
Please do Americano Vespucci oversimplified!! (The man ‘The Americas’ get their name from)
"Americans keep coming and they dont stop coming hop in their wagons and hit the ground running" damn that was fire
I would like a sequel where Lyman chooses the 3 wishes
3:31 I love this bit. "America wanted to expand." then the U.S. says "IT'S MY DENSITY!!!"
Turns out Biden was too busy selling America to China then expanding America into Canada.
Love the part where they're talking about what happened with the pig and how that dude called everyone an idiot.
Emu more like emo.
7:57
Porky was the original waddles...
You all schude jius Northvpn
How is this OverSimplified’s longest video
"I've got my spotted dick" Me:💀💀💀💀💀💀😭💀💀💀💀💀
I love how Americans always 1812 war was a draw lmfao. It wasn't, you lost. The Objective was to seize territory from Canada. You didnt gain any territory and we burnt down your white house. Twice mind you.
Welp that ending ruined my canadian day... keep your senile president to yourself america....
2:47
The end is the most American thing ever lol
American expand so as his d-💀
21:00
OKAY so I went to this gIfTeD camp last last summer and it was the end of class and everyone had their laptops out and these two guys were watching this video and then they started chanting "INVADE CANADA INVADE CANADA INVADE CANADA" and more people joined in and they kept going until class was over and everyone reached the dining hall and also there was a Canadian guy at camp in the same class 💀
It’s a shame I only just now discovered this channel; it’s easily one of the most entertaining and well edited series of videos where I get a laugh and still feel like I’ve learned something about history!
7:57 is literally the improvised version of  ‘all star’
1:20 😂😂😂
The sheep: "Yankee scum!" 😂😂😂
Aight, we had an almost war with Canada, now you gotta do one for the ACTUAL war with Mexico
This is more important. If the British would have helped the Confederacy there might not be a United States to fight for in WW2.
A man
28:38 OMG I FOUND JAMES BUCHANAN
3:33 Florida kinda looks like as di-
33:33 it is safe to say that Harney's actions angered General Wifield Scott greatly, who punished him severely
Who thinks Florida looks like a di-
great name on the 7th ear of jizzington
dont try to invade canada again, remember what happened the first time
More like manifest dysentery am I right?
07:55
I watch a lot of these maybe three or four of them a week this one is by far must have been written by somebody else it's completely hysterical a little bit edgy maybe a lot of edgy and I love it keep it up
Disgusting dude
I can never unsee Florida being America’s penis
Thanks man, You got me an A+ on my Social Studies project
NATO just won't help canada???
Now that I think about it Canada has some pretty voluptuous territory 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I live history
Is the outro bit a reference to his WWI video where he accidentally put a US flag over canada lmao
Gotta love the "straight line?" "straight line."
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
In case anyone was wondering, $100 USD back in 1859, is about $3,600 today.
This is the real reason the uk joined the entente Germany didn’t give them the islands
giving America arms and legs makes Florida look "interesting"
America don’t you dare!
“Being an American, he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a knife.”  🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸🔫🔫🔫🔫🔪🇺🇸
I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR LETTERS. N. A. T. O.
But we had a war anyway. Sorry to bring it up
Imagine how well the nordvpn character would be in a Celtic video
Who else remembers when this said “2 hours ago”
As someone who was born in the city the Hudson Bay company abandonded, I loved this video. I always knew about the pig war, but it's good to see all the specifics (like I didn't realize that it was just before the civil war). It was classic local politics almost overriding national concern.   The whole 'straight line' boarder leads to one very bizarre location: Point Roberts, Washington. A tiny pennisula cut off from the rest of the US by Canada. If you want to drive there from the US, you have to enter British Columbia. The boarder crossing at Point Roberts includes handing you a map of the whole pennisula with all the gas stations and the 2 restaurants marked. The major economic driver of Point Roberts is selling cheap gas to Canadians. (So Point Roberts would be really sad if we invaded Canada:).  Side note: I was quite stoked to see that the Hudson Bay Company still exists and is now a major department store.
6:35 the frikin yt like pop up plays here and its hilarious
Ahh yes 7:57
Ahh yes the music 7:57
7:54 are you looking for this?
I'm not American. I'm Australian. But god damn, that last section about manifest destiny got me feelin' patriotic...
Invade Canada? I'd like to see you try to and invade my country, in winter no less
do the balken wars
Video idea US invasion of Greneda
Yo it waddles from gravity falls
No just no
0:45 really shocked me
We can only dream. For now
7:55
Best ending ever
USA + CANADA + MEXICO + UK + AUSTRALIA + FRANCE + SPAIN + IRELAND + NZ  = WORLD'S SUPER POWER
11:35 this is probably a pun I don't get but the term is grubby not glubby
🐏🐑🐐🐖🐄
The new Punic War episodes are fantastic, but this has to be the funniest episode to daye
I would be british if this didn't happen. Fun.
Over a hundred years later, the British and French negotiating the partition of the Ottoman Empire France: ... UK: ... France: ... UK: straight line? France: straight line.
Straight line?
This is the last video for a while until the Punic wars saga ends
3:38 Its my density 💀
Griffin is the ancient and British version of John Wick
the past part was the best icing on the cake, thats right canadians,  we're coming
Bah, one winter up here and you'd be running back to Texas.
dude, this is the longest oversimplified video
I love how all of this is pure comedy gold
7:06 fun fact this guy was the first guy to beat Mike Tyson
He makes the sponsored ad fun to watch
It's great to see this competent side of General Scott for once, not just his shortcomings during the civil war
Best one! Awesome video
America was bound to expand sooner or later even if the west wasn’t inhabited by natives but by Europeans in colonies or independent states. It would have just taken longer or another form, and not necessarily less violent just missing the reservations and probably the massacres that took place in this timeline.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Such a great viddo and all the craziness
The sheer amount of shade thrown to the Muricans for the native population genocide was..  Amusing 😂😂😂
I actually looked this up in the aftermath, and found a plate was but up in remembrance of that so-called war on those islands
tf was that outro???
I can make a compromise you get free healthcare and you get Tim portons and we get all your cool stores, to be real somebody tell me how am I supposed to feel about this
reported for inciting national unrest
Did anyone notice that he rapped?
How did General Harney keep his job after so many mistakes?
36:56 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
This is perfect proof that the USA was, is and will be a pain in the arse to everyone
The great replacement by americans
The Red Coats and the Maple Drinker almost kicked the buckle that time...
this is already 2 years old?
16:00 You're an American holding a Russian gun.
So thats how racism was invented
Yeeeeesssssss goooooood........ We shall liberate Canada!
As a Canadian I am now sleeping with one eye open
Why did you make harney seem so much better in your civil war video and why did you make Winsfeild Scott seem so bad in your civil war video?
This video made me love America even more
DRAKE FOR PRESIDENT
My teacher played this video for history class and I freaked out so loudly because it was oversimplified   We spoke later and it appears he enjoys the video as well and frequently plays then in other periods
163 years later Buchanan seems a lot like Biden
Gotta love American absurdist humor
7:55
I'm Protecting Canada And Ruby Gillman , Because she's canadian and that's racism
Fun fact: 5 videos have been released since i subscribed like 3 years ago 😭😭😭
*<checks the border on google maps halfway through the video>* Of course we ended up with all the islands haha
9:10 lol 😂
Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life..
best video by you 😀
Ooh yah. Canada has noo nukes, or soo we'd like you to think. Eh.
"You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You guys are fine. And you two are the most mind-numbingly brain-dead ding-dongs I've ever encountered in all my life!" Why does this describe every friend group in existence lol?
Drake for American president!!!!!!! (Including Canada of course)
🎉🎉🎉
27:27 The most underrated Oversimplified joke there is 😂
K-? K-?? KZ-?? -??
37:19 bro the american💀
I mean tbf, not mentioning canada's contributions in ww1/2 is kinda lame.
The “I didn’t say there were white people” was a lil bit crazy tbh 😅
7:54 all star oversimplified
What the actual fuck
That part about taking over  canada at the end really resonates with me now
I love how most Americans don’t know any of these islands and as such have no idea how this ends.
my drunk ass thought "the place war rammed with sheep" (11:53) was the funniest thing I've heard all day
“4 pistols and a big knife”   Bruh 😂
what i learn about usa through this video is they are but hole
It's 2 years already since this video was released?! 😱I'm feeling old...😢
Because of the new update when he said " Like this video" in 6:34 the like button highlighted
the americans would not have won
Brother went on his villain arc at the end there. As an American, I’m all for it
7:57 perfect
Someday, I hope we can all watch an Oversimplified video on Biden's invasion of Canada.
the end got me died🤣
HOLY MARY MOTHER OF JOSÈ 700K LIKES
US invasion of Canada OVERSIMPLIFIED | coming 2028
America is the most powerful country bro we could steamroll the rest of the continent
From 37:26 to 38:21. The best part of the episode by far. That was amazing.
White people.
General scott telling everyone they are an idiot makes this magnificent
13:29 😂😂😂
Bacon has been made. Poor pig
37:09 best scene
36:58
Hey Canada, how does it feel knowing that the only reason you aren’t subjects of the USA is because you’re not worth having?
This has been where Oversimplified has been for the past year, finalizing his plans to invade and conquer Canada to Manifest Destiny towards the North. Finally, our glorius country will be united with Alaska under one continuous landmass!!
"Straight line?" "Straight line."  best discussion ever had in history
Did that guy literally meant to nuke me at the end?
Do Ireland
Still can't believe we nearly went to war again over this
3:57 "i hear voices all the time" lol
lol did not see that end coming
Britain really shouldve kept hold of all the colonies ffs haha
7:58-8:06 All Star
7:58 all star reference
as a canadian the last part was not cool man, not freacking cool
10:36 The 7th Earl of Jizzingham...
He might just have gone insane, heh… please don‘t shoot me.
The greatest speech in all of America
33:22 this made me laugh so hard😂
7:58 this is ryhmin boy
hilarious!
I love how the ending rant is about how we should invade Canada because we want to be more like them
2:35 our finest moment 🇬🇧
Interestingly, that bit of land where the border turns south from the lake to the 49th parallel is the only part of the United States that is impossible to reach by road from the United States. You have to either get there by boat, or come in through Canada.
This may sound weird but I think you should do the two ballin wars
America got teritory by whining.
3:35 what florida up to giving the us a 3rd leg🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
I just realized the mob boss pig is so offputting because it actually has a walking animation, unlike everyone else in Oversimplified
31:04 it's my 10th time watching this yet it always catches me off guard 🤣🤣 oversimplified is a genius
Yeah occupy canada , who lines em either way
AND HE SACRIFICES HIS AUDIENCE 37:15
7:53
I find it shocking that Harney wasn’t like.. kicked out of the military for insubordination and being a dumbass. I would’ve after his first few idiot moves, not trusting him to use his tiny brain lol
Ha! Canada is so large and sparsely populated the Americans would have to find us first…in the like four cities where most of us live. 😂  Fun fact, California has higher population than Canada.
37:41 I love how you say that if the USA invaded Canada, the best food and national park would be Canadian things, Thanks!
Pickett seems to have made a history of having superiors make REALLY bad decisions that he had to (attempt to) carry out; Harney here, and Longstreet/Lee at Gettysburg.
I laugh at the Joe Biden threat
Bro the beginning lol
I live in America but come on.
why did they just put the middle channel it was fair Americans a so like bro?
Bro is really about to start a war
This is the most beautiful video I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching
Is anyone going to talk about the Florida penis?
Its been 2 years and over a year since he posted last hope he didn’t quit he was my favourite YouTuber
As a Canadian, the last part scared me
29 vids 8 million sub how pls tell me
1:24 gets me 😂
Canada is doomed
lol
6:35
This is hilarious
Was soll man sagen, Deutschland, Deutschland, überall!
4:42 "These white people sure love beavers!"          Yes. We certainly do. 😂😂😂
Straight line?
Talking like his human nature is better than everyone else's. If only he had been King back then, or president. Everything wouldve turned out so much better.
7:57 this angered the British, who punished the Americans severely
Please Maratha Empire please please please
You made Florida a penis ........... I SAW IT!!!!!!!!! ... and can't un-see it!
As an American i approve the message at the end of this video!
14:24 Sheriff Barnes was going to arrest Charles Griffin?     I love the Andy Griffith Show
As a American I am gonna be flying with the bald eagle if we invaded  🇨🇦
Unexpected. 7:58
4:31 Upper??? Lower?
OverSimplified, Sam O’Nella if he used vector drawing tools.
I wasvnot exepecting that last part espicially as a canadian
There was no shot fired by any sides of the conflict (expect for the pig), also there wasn’t any official declaration of war
This wasss a fuckinng amazing video!
After oversimplified said why not? He already started sounding crazy
General Pickett and Harney  are Idiots From the Sound of things
Lincoln was better  James Buchanan was a Idiot!!!!!! This is the most stupidist war i ever heard of Always the Frigging Europeans and southern americans starting stuff
7:54  but the americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running (ima make more soon)
11:49 Oh Yeah That’s right, The Kamehameha Dynasty of The Kingdom of Hawai’i kept close ties with the British during the early post-contact period, no wonder he said “Hawaiian Sheppards.” Unfortunately the islands were annexed by America in the late 19th. Century 😔
4:17 and out came the Tommy guns…
In 7:59 i found some all star lol
Florida popping out from in-between the legs just looks wrong
As an American, that ending was terrifying.
first 2 min and a um a raisist comment😂
7:56
7:58 All star
One of my favorite bits in Oversimplified history is National Emblem playing muffled at first until exploding into clarity as American settlers destroy the surrounding area
I’m Canadian you will never take Canada.
If Charles died it would have mostly led to a war... Maybe, just like WW1 😐
Ðęąð řįğħþ ňøŵ
/;[
Turned on this video while shiny hunting and I found one, it was a Flebebé
7:58  HEY NOW, YOURE AN ALL STAR
After taking AP US history this becomes exponentially more relatable
The fact that the island was named San Juan is the funniest part about this video because my name is Juan
the weeknd kinda looks like the irish dude
the canada rant is still one of the most unhinged things he’s put in a video
Like if you live in Whatcom county because I live in it 👇
The pig made a reference to farcry3 lol
7:57 THATS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And talking for 18 minutes about a bucket
12:15 we see the first pig of the video
38:12 that's what Biden said to his daughter in the shower.
bro let out his intrusive thoughts at the end
4:11 'MURICA!!!!!
well, that was bit patriotic at the end there.
Where are you?
7:56
I for the life me can’t wrap my head around the fact we let Canada sit up there peacefully. Sure the Canadians are peaceful, but we sure as shit are not.
8:00
7:54 And they dont stop coming
7:56 is my favourite part
7:58
Over a damn 🐖 pig
BUCHANAN!!
Bruh! 3:35 having Florida as America's junk is 🤌 😆
23:00 I can hardly believe it took me this long...lol...  ...but;  Isn't this the same Pickett who, as a higher-ranking officer a few years after this incident, led an ill-fated charge during the US Civil War...either at Gettysburg or at Antietam?  I've also heard that Pickett's Charge, as it's called, wasn't a failure so much due to Pickett's actions. Instead, I've heard that a couple of outside occurrences were to blame; More specifically, the poor decisions and fruitless actions taken by his fellow commanders...actions in which General Pickett wasn't even involved...combined with the poor communications that dogged All of General Lee's subordinate commanders...These were the actual reasons for what happened that day, during the Civil War.  34:50  Ahhh...Gettysburg...Gotcha!
Greatest ending of all time😂
Canada is allied with britan and britan has nukes.
The McDonald's supposed to unnecessary thing for Americans to have
Get thee off my Island you Gretzky loving moose herders!
7:56- 8:06 Memed quote: "But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming"
3:47 you can hear: “yeah that’s what he said right, and at 3:53 you can hear: “we thought it was Sharon’s cat” and “I hear things all the time though”
Funny to know about how Brits have fought other Brits😂
🤮🤮🤮
He sounds like megamind at the end
6:35 the like button glows lol
7:58 there, all star
I'm American and Canadian
As a Canadian I must say, no thanks
I love how oversimplified managed to threaten an entire country using joe Biden as the aggressor.. magician
oversimplified is one of 2 people i know who has taught people history in a way that actually engages the learners. the other is my 8th grade history teacher who had us do skits and many other things as a way of showing what we learned, but his teaching style was also pretty good seeing as it was inclusive to just about all types of learners, whether they be hands on or wall of text learners
🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
You had way too much fun with that outro it was hilarious 🤣
Maple syrup for all Americans! Beavers! Auroras!  Our rights we'll defend, our density we'll manifest! 🇺🇸 GOD BLESS!
Biden would never invade Canada.
So the boxer rebellion
7:57 epic
Conquered not stolen
Buchanan screaming in fear from behind the curtin will never stop making me cry from laughing.
waddles ancestors be gettin into some shii in the old days
Brilliant
Bruh
I love the ending and the claims on what happened “last summer”
Bro oversimplified is spittin bars!
Lmao ur fantastic. The ending of was soooooo good. Love it
Make more videos of all this. This is so intertaning 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah... Canada had it coming. I mean, did you see what it was wearing?
It took me this long to notice why are the flags blowing diffrent ways
why was no one talking about that goofy laugh the Hawaiian had 18:33
14:29 I see what you did there, OverSimplified 👀
Biden is coming, I got my doubts 😂 seriously hilarious ending 😂
3:50 "And who was it who spoke to God?" -"It was Billy right?" -"I thought it was Sherman's cat." -"I hear voices all the time!"
I think youtube is bugging out. There is no way that this has only 400 likes.
There is something to be said for spinning history into a Smashmouth parody...
As a Canadian, I wouldn’t mind being American right now
Id like to sea a maple leaf as the 51 state on the us flag
It’s time to Annex Canada and the entire Caribbean
Is it harney or horn-
Lets g oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
5 days until it's 2 years old
1:19 best roast ever! 😂🔥
" why you- BAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  "BAAAAAAAA"
21:22 😂. Scheme mode never fails to make me laugh.
37:07 is the timestamp for the Canadian invasion part
You had me until white man Bad..
bruh
1 year later i would definitely love to see one of your videos centered on some kind of big event in Canadian history (we don't really get our history talked about much) but we have had some major events in our history that is worth talking about.
Ok
10:58 💀
Fun fact, Captain Hornby went on to be the British Fleet Admiral, so his coolheadess definitely helped
I can never seen the north VPN logo without looking like blue hair
As a European history student the more i actually study American history the more i can't help to wish the british won in the American revolution, really like... Guys you're the only ones starting wars where there's no need for them, call me a communist (and trust me, you don't know what you're talking about when you say communist, even if in my case you'd be right) but just... please stop, nobody can stand you anymore dear USA.  Aside from that i like these videos, they're really well done even if they often report outdated ideas and simplify things a bit too much but hey, that's how the channel is named after all, we can pass that, just don't take everything as golden true and use an actual history book if you want to study these topics (i suggest European ones for reasons I'm not listing here)
31:03 epic!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he said i’d worry less about Canada’s curves and more about your own curves Benjamin is crazy
38:37 Nice of you to show credit to the guy who voiced the pig. Also, bloody great ending.
HOW IS THERE ONLY 70 LIKES
Philippines history is a good material for your content im a new fan who also like history in every country good content please make one talking about Filipino warrior dont talk about our soldiers and politics we have dark history we killed the only great  general we have against America so just our warriors and also Japanese history also just the warriors😢
Pilipino's mountain warriors and urban tribe's how fight the three country who colonies Philippine is a good story
9:23 okay, does anyone else kinda feel irritated about that tiny speck of blue on the peninsula north of San Juan? it just really bugs me.  yes, i know it's not the important part of the story, but it really bugs me. it just feels petty, is all
With the housing crisis in Canada right now, I almost think Canada would be better merged with the USA currently if it was officially taken in the 19th century
commenting
did anyone notice a map with a split vietnam and china during the border talking in each of them there this map on the table near the american
25:40 they convinced a politician to say “I was wrong” that’s impressive, because in our days that would be political suicide.
36:17 Imagine watching this video literally on the same date, 161 years later!
Bro people still watch this
God bless America
I feel bad for the sheep guy
vote here for DRAKE!!!!! 👇
u should make a video on da mexican american war
33:33 bro started beating him with a belt
6:29 curiosity killed the cat
lol Biden is coming😂😂 the man can’t even get up stairs let alone maintain or start a war😂 I will agree he does make decent decisions, but a way no
3:31 woah
The only place Biden is coming is in his depends in his sleep dreaming of his showers with his daughter. He’s sick and twisted and couldn’t find his way out of a paper bag..
7:56 But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming. Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon, when they outnumbered the Brits more than 6 to 1.
3 years later and yet nothing
Before pig During pig After pig
what the song at 26:50
4:06 basically American imperialism through all of their existence
uncool
can you make a video about the chinese civil war
“Lyman,if you spare my life,I’ll give you three wishes-“
I think it’s fitting that my first video I saw from oversimplified (me being a chaotic person) is a video about a war that almost started because of a pig😅lol
12:53 the way they were talking and arguing in sheep languages 😂😂😂
23:00 Did you mean "Succeed" or success..?! 🧐🤨🤔 Never mind: You ment separate that actually make sense 😂😂👍
This is the loveliest war I have ever witness! 😂😂😂😂
Still waiting on your next video…..
All county...make war...for A PİG?!??!!!!!?!????!??!?!?!
32:31 average gen alphas
I love oversimplified so much!! I watch it every day!!!
Love the shrek reference
Yooo Bro I really don't like that end bit
As a German, supporting UK, I agree anyone in America should shut the hell up.
The speech made me feel some type of way
32:30 Me(Winfield) with my friends:
You should have put both flags red because both America and England were so greedy for that island (those islands, sorry for the mistake)
5:15
I looked away for a moment until I heard "Biden is coming" and my brain turned the second word into you know what and I was like what the fu
NAHHHHHHHHHH BROO 😭😭 (but i honestly think kansas will positively lose monday)
Proof that humans will go to war over just about anything if left to our own devices!
Bidens coming
32:31
imagine if they have email back then.
over simplfied get some help
38:11 pov Biden the millisecond he sees a kid holding an ice cream all by themselves
Some of my fav lines- -I'd worry less about canadas curves and more about your own curves Benjamin- -But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in there wagons and they hit the ground runnin. Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon when the Americans outnumbered Brit's more than 6-1- -were they British? Or were they American? Sure this won't cause anyone to -*-DIE-* -Oh porky.. you look stunning..- -IM PERFECTLY STABLE YOU RATBAG CALL ME CRAZY AND ILL EAT YOUR EYES!!- -American colonising+ NOOOOOOOOOOOO- -and lazy as pie 😌- =Doing more soon maybe?=
Benjamin got roasted😂
Finally something going on in my state💀
it should’ve been obvious that the islands were british, since vancouver island was british and the brits let the americans have almost everything else. it’s clear that the islands were part of the larger vancouver island
I like the way dis guy just transitions to his ads
7:27 16:29 10:23 11:09 33:29  7:57 13:27 13:59 18:45 19:01 19:07 19:23
7:57
Ahah as a Canadian the ending is so triggering.
16:28, 7:25
I like to imagine a world where the people involved in this conflict were able to see this video
The best part of the video is 1:20
The 7th earl of "jizzingham" bro I'm 21 I can't be laughing at this shit LMAO
Pig down!
Ain't nobody scared of Biden.
A whole 38 minutes to tell the story of a war that never had any fighting
The end was wild
Amazing channel. Does anyone know of a channel with a similar sarcastic and to the point approach with other subjects like science?
War warn war war😊
7:20 Does anyone know where I can find this march? I must laugh any time when I hear that music😂
31:00 IS THAT MORGAN FREEMAN’S PIG?!?!?
Black people wondering what the intro was 👇
Your mabe right at the end but trump
26:48
what is it with you and cats?
Canada need some FREEDOM  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 **Eagle screech** 🦅🦅🦅
Ah, straight lined borders, never failed Britain
all this cuz a pig ate a potato
The reason why the US can't invade Canada is because of NATO. Since, if a nation is attacked, all nations in NATO will defend the NATO country. So all the members of NATO would get involved... all the members... including... the United States. So everyone including the United States will declare war on the United States. Then, because the US is a part of NATO, the NATO members will attack all the attackers.  No I'm not OK.
Bro the sheep be speaking British 🤣🤣
38:00 oversimplified voice look anger that Canadian always complain about Canada is not in the video😂😂😂(i love this part in video)
When America says it's my destiny, he actually says it's my density.
well  you see the reason you don't invade Canada now is because if you did the sanctions that would be put on America would make Russia look prosperous
Good Luck Fending off the Kobra Chickens
I will never get over how creative using the nord logo as hair is, also how obsessed poor oversimplified is with the hitler video being blocked
16:27 love the muffled music getting clearer as the americans approach.
I like the last minutes
The first was kinda racist
7:50  is where he sings all star btw
This game is ratet pig 18
“Hunt, your fired. Pickett, you going back on the island! ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH, IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS!!!! 33:26 pls reply
An only casualty of this war was one pig? Are you kidding me? That's one way too many! Poor thing.
Yeah, those 'ruthless, collective imperialist tendencies' are what created the greatest, most prosperous and mightiest nation on Earth with an army every other nation else fears. Here goes that stupid leftist virtue signalling. It can be showed right down into a** of anyone who subscribes to that. Screw that self-righteous 'morality'. Without manifest destiny, without imperialist tendencies USA would never become powerful but instead be a nation of whiny, oversensitive pussies.
21:22 lmaooo
You're not talking about Poland enough 38:04
To provide an idea on just how old Winfield Scott was; he wasn't just a veteran of the Mexican-American War. He had been serving in the Army since the War of 1812!
“I don’t want you usin’ my toothbrush.” *me about to brush my teeth*
I don't see the changes of the US/Canada border
I didn’t say they were white people, 😂💀
Dude plz invade....we need it
I hope Oversimplified’s planning of the US conquest of Canada with Joe Biden is going well
Hey this has been really nagging at me for months what’s the music at 7:25 ?
👍👍
Prepare for the Canadian Anschluss
They say three 911 calls were made by oversimplified’s neighbours when he was recording those last lines.
amazing video
19:37 thats $3800 in todays money
"As Americans, they pulled out guns on him." I never thought I would feel so much pride in a sentence during a youtube video.
America America America
Dude. Biden doesn't even remember when his birthday is. How's he gonna get Canada. Dude can't even speak English.
"BUT- BUT- BUT- TA- BAAAAAAAAA!" "BAAAAAAAA!"
"This video was made possible by-"  **sigh**
Ya know, that picture of Biden at the end made me realize that he has a Tom Cruise thing going on with his teeth, quite strange.
**Gun happy men with gold addiction Vs sugar-rubbing-into-teeth-men with long guns with a 9 year long reload time.**
‘Merica
Thanks!
as a canadaian living in winnupeg, I can confirm that the tiny island should've been brittish teritory.
every oversimplified video every  nord VPN nord VPN
31:26 lemme just say, this scene is OverSimplified’s voice acting at its best Edit: nvm, ending is absolutely incredible as well
when you gave America legs Florida made it look funny
one shutters to imagine the rage OverSimplified felt when he heard the smoke polluting America's air came from Canada
Did he say di##
the empire of doom
Wow I never knew they fought a war over your mom
Sigma British diplomat
Great way to show your objectivity from the very beginning
We'll, someone mix the Dhar Mann's "So, you see..." 😂😂😂 moments
Nord vpn sponsor ends at 6:54
Because of this video, I’d I figured out how to do my geography test I pass my geography test because of this video😅😅😅
The end about Canada was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
obviously america had to say "its my DENSITY"
I am almost positive the reason he wanted to start a war was so he could attempt to prove his leadership to rise the ranks by leading the war.
All of that for a single pixel on the US map
BIDEN IS COMING CANADA!
Oh wow, I’m so scared of your 90 year old president (I’m canadien)
As a Canadian, that last rant about how we could be American… that was terrifying
13:25
You did the Pig War and you did the War of the Bucket, and you did the Football War... now all is left is the Pastry War between Mexico and France, which started when Mexico would not compensate a French baker for losing his pastries from a looting.
The whole "send a message to ask permission but attack and conquer before the message gets there" thing led to a lot of British and Zulu deaths at Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift. I don't recommend the tactic.
One of the best segues into an ad I've ever seen.  Also love the crossed brollies on the British cabin.
25:10 PRINCESS
29:18 Got me rolling💀
@33:30 why can't I stop watching this?
Do vietnam
It's waddles from gravity falls
One of the most important lessons of history is how many times horribly destructive events have or may have happened for the sole reason of someone in charge being a massive buffoon.
The hitler video is definitely blocked in Israel
0:37 is literally what Britain meant by equality
7:56
NO SPUDDY🥔😢
3:38 ITS MY DENSITYY!                                  -USA, OverSimplified
the last part started good except when the episode really ended i confirm as a canadian
"2318008" 💀
I know who IM voting for!  Drake! Its Drake! Its always Drake!
7:57 was so funny peak video peak song as well
As a Canadian I’m terrified
“I didn’t say they were white people” 💀💀💀
As someone from the PNW I loved hearing about this. And the inclusion of Mt. Rainier in some of the backgrounds was beautiful
Oh hell nah 13:00💀💀💀💀
OverSimpified is cool!!!
31:33 i though that was morgan freeman lol
The BAAAAAAHHH argument always gets me 😂
at the start with that roast by the brits ruined ben's day, week, month, year, career, and life
Oversimplified just declared war on canada?💀
Bro is gonna start a war with Canada over a YouTube video
28:07 ”But I like to think”  *ad plays 💀*
HOG RIDER!!!!!!!
Far as I’m concerned, not sure why we don’t own Canada and Mexico personally.
so basically people back then had no common sense.
pig war? man, technoblade would be proud
The middle channel may be correct
36:04 just truly American
10:32  “The 7th Earl of *Jizz*-ingham says he encountered a foul beast in the fields of Upper *Fart*-ingham late last night”. Jesus Christ 💀
Where did he go
10:23 This is the most accurate representation of British Parliament I have ever seen
7:57
😑WOW WE ARE NOT DUMB the vido was really good tho
How he managed to get Morgan Freeman on here?
This has to be one of the funniest videos he has made
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL!
I’ve never felt more patriotic, LETS TAKE CANADA
"BUCHANAN" 😂😂😂
Dude...where ya been? Need some new videos.. surely there's plenty of wars and events where people died needless to mock! Come on, Man!
This entire video felt like some weird ass dream
Finland :D
Now that I realize it Nord VPN is the most OP character
7:55 oversimplified started rapping 😅
I like how he turned into a Republican at the end
10:25 George the guy with the mole was hitten out and he came back at 10:45
bro hit his villain arc with those Canadian comments
Best part of the video 37:08
I did t know America ate a burger and grew a dick
USA YOU ARE NOT  TEAKING CANADA
Upper fartingdom 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That ending was REALLY uncalled for
bro got overexited in the end
Well I guess we're invading canada... WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
31:02 is this Morgen Freemans Voice?
17:45 Man, this Brit loves his pig
Hahaha so funny daddy
37:32 no just no
I'd rather much prefer you not invade Canada thank you kindly, it would very much hurt my feelings
14:53 that IS amarykan.  17:14 "LAZY as pie " what a fantastic side chuckle. Pie,🥧,very amarykan & 🐛🅰💤♈
3:37 you knew what u we’re doing to Florida
What happened? No uploads anymore? DId u run out of wars?
But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming 😏😏😏😏😩😩😩😩😩😩🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🫃🫃🫃🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
7:59 love the shrek song refrence there
1:21 when he said worry abt ur own curves I thought he was talking about America not having much land but no that was fat shaming
19:33 more understandable words haven't been said
Looks like a great battle for a dream island huh...
3:37 it says density not destiny
BAAAAAA!!!!!
i am not Americana in any manner still the RANT/SPECCH in the end made may say "OOOHHHRAAAA CANADA HERE WE COME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1:23 Britan was willing to cede large parts of modern Canada to America but we never pushed for it in peace conference. There’s a pretty cool map of lines where the British where willing to cede to.
I love my country
For everyone’s reference. $100 in 1859 is worth about $3,700 dollars today. That’s for just 1 pig
Beat = طرد Negotiate = تفاوض Freak = غريب أطوار Crap
"Lyman shot the pig" -18:49
Please make another video😂
Lol just try it america, we can retreat 4x farther north that the Russians did east in ww2 hahahhahah
I hope oversimplified does the Mexican American war
Would be a shame if somebody ate them
I am British briten is best🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Bro not Joe Biden who can't walk up the stairs😂😂
DUDE  INDIAAAA
32:17
32:16
Best closing scene of any oversimplified video
"you my friend, should use NORDVPN!"
yo you should make a mexican america war
america is too easy to humiliate. because we suck. really really hard. being so religious makes it easier and funnier, because so many people do horrible horrible things in it’s name. god told me to be super racist, i swear! god must have told us to break every treaty we ever sign too. cuz breaking treaties is our brand. because, as previously mentioned, we suck. i recommend turning off your air conditioner, facing reality, and changing the world.
i feel like OverSimplified should be a pro voice actor
if it wasnt for their destiny to make the world a "better" place,  they would have destroyed EVERYTHING. but they made is slightly better by only  killing the animals. (<-- this is obviously made for a joke.)
I like these smaller stories because they're both funny little tidbits of history filled with comedy and are also able to teach us about much larger parts of history, like the War of The Bucket teaching us about the Holy Roman Empire, or this talking about Westward Expansion, it's pretty neat.
2:15 just curious, but why is the western border of Illinois there twice?
I’m American but in this time/scenario the American sucked
Why would Wayne Gretzky be in Montreal? He played in Edmonton.
'I hear voices all the time' The little gems you pick up in crowd talking moments
Oh you sweet summer child. The reason we don't go to war with Canada because we found out after ww1 when you let Canadians fighting Big boy wars they treat the Geneva convention like a checklist
Well uh Canada and USA joined forces and are now working together
I think he’s getting more and more unhinged with every video he makes
About to do my research paper on this because of you. Hope I can’t get 5 pages out of it
Pleas come back please
Bruh. Good Morning Kitten is a real site.
Woo hoo let's go invade canada
As a decedent of the settlers, I'm not sorry. The map now looks as it should. Lol
Something make me think Oversimplifed is Pickett reincarnated.
12:20 Odell Beckham Jr
I think you guy insane
Talk about the Irish Home Rule Crisis, Easter Rising, War Of Independence and Irish Civil War please
Americans if your out there please invade canada I rather be american!!!
How was the war lof 1812 a draw when america invaded, and were still canada… USA lost that war.
7:58 to 8:02 is the best quote I'll ever hear.
I’m Canadian and I’m scared now
I honestly feel bad for the British after watching this a second time
Ya know, after watching the civil war videos,  its actually interesting seeing Winfield Scott as an actually confident millitery tactician
Those countries that grow where the USA has the best geographical advantage in the world (in my opinion)
That outro was wild
bro really got into the spirit at the end
Love that boaty McBoatface reference. Brilliant
Nevee understand how 1812 isnt anything other than a defeat for US, failed to annex Canada and got your capital conquered and seat of government burned down 😂
I like how America's legs have Florida in between them.
38:12 USA USA USA 🇺🇸
1:48 sepArating not sepErating
Na when Biden orders the invasion of Canada an advisor will say "What did you say mister president? Send more money to Ukraine? Will do immediately!"
Does anyone know the song that plays every time the Americans turn up?
The ending was.... THE BEST THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
33:30 Favorite scene
roll around in that cow crap (on a sheep farm)
7:56 I love this part
The British didn't make Harney cry like a little girl, but Scott sure did
"And who was it that spoke to god?"  "It was Billy right? -heard it was Sharon's Cat-Well I hear voices all the time"
America
The fact the Griffin actually said (allegedly) to the farmer that it is up to him to keep his potatoes out of his pig is so hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
7:15 what the f
🇨🇦rip🇨🇦
Make a new vedio
16:01 why is the American shooting an AK-47
How's about doing one on Project Legacy?
31:08
Manifesting destiny haha
Funny parts: 1:22 10:25 16:27
1:21 - 1:25 idc how corny it may have sounded, i laughed frr😭
Wrong.  I never realize how off all of these simplify videos were until you cover the topic that I’m well educated on.   What establish government was created by the Indians?   You’re just another American that hates America probably.  Thus proving that Americans do not deserve the United States
it was canadians who burnt the white hose not the brits
For anyone not knowing what 100$ was at the time. It was approximately 3,600$
All star reference?
The final 90 seconds is the greatest conclusion to a video on all of YouTube.
murica da best
I have the enamel pin from visiting San Juan island, half a Brit flag and half an American. But the British north is almost all rock, pine trees, wild turkeys and a pretty good cover for shelter, while the south USA area is actual arable land.
Bruh I always love it when the characers scream and exaggerate Lol its always funny😂😂😂
9:19 hate to be Douglas
7:57 i love how he just casually slips in lyrics of "All star" 😂
Griffin's reaction to hearing the fact that lyman killed his pig plus the aftershock if it, and the fact that it immediately cuts to "the good ol days" flashbacks is actually legitimately sad imo
the pig almost war
7:57 RIP Steve
I think he should do ww1
So ya see. Its always been dems. Sorry. Facts.
We heard Biden was coming so we put some stairs to the entrance of Canada. He’ll never be able to get in now.
Virgins: I wonder what would've happened if the Confederates won Gigachads: I wonder what would've happened if the Pig War escalated
My fav part was (besides everything) the crazy man speaking sheep with a ram :D
It should be obvious that the American claim to the islands is refuted by the fact that the British concession of Pacific coastline was granted against their own interests for stabilities sake and the reference to the channel pertained to the separation between the mainland coast and the islands. Give them a kilometer and they'll take a mile.
33:29 😂😂😂
I used an inflation calculator and the $100 that Charles Griffin asked for in reparation for his pig would be worth almost $4,000 today. ($3,970 to be exact if you’re curious)
The thought occurs to me that both the Emu War and the Pig War could’ve been prevented if the farmers have better fences
Hope @OverSimplified does a focused video on the wild west. Seems like a juicy history subject
It was Billy’s cat
15:27 I belive I am the only person alive that has saw the vid that has noticed a mustang convertible on the right side. And it’s as American as apple pie.
Dude I swear 10:23 to 11:00 is so funny
Actually, some think the British fermented the Civil War.
5:15 Politics in a nutshell.
When hypocritical white ppl expanded west. Thus began the bloodiest conflict ever with over a million Indigenous ppl being screwed over by untrustworthy scumbags who kept breaking the treaty over and over again.
As a Canadian, I can confirm that this is exactly how the ‘disagreement’ played out. Well done
I think its the middle the treaty said it would go through the middle of the channel so it would be in the middle of the islands
7:57 RIP lead singer of Smash Mouth
Who spoke to god? It was billy. No it was sean. I heard it was cat.
A little late to nab Canada now. Probably should’ve gotten it during one of the world wars instead of pointlessly deploying in Europe.
7:57 Yo, Oversimplified goin off! 😮💃💃
I think a video about the Donner party would be great
37:51 got me dying
33:25 got me dying
Can you do Denmark’s history please
I want to say I've never been more enthralled by pigs and potatoes, but pulled pork poutine exists... A close second though!
The United States and Canada are in nato
vote trump 2024/// herooooooooooooooooo
Great documentary.   In conlcusion, I prefer the potato over the pig.
As a Canadian, I have to say, I HATE that end part.
Do a video about ned Kelly next
You can have the islands, you can definitely have Quebec, but you can NEVER. HAVE. OUR. MAPLE SYRUP!!!!!!!!! 🍁 🇨🇦
Look between americas legs
Plushie sold out? 😢  Boooo 👎😫👎
😭Sad he could not see how far his channel became🕊   Fly high
Starting a war by shooting a pig 💀💀💀
As a Brit I’m very proud we could have scared a us president back in the day
❤
Did the scene where Harney gets wipped is true? Or he just got yelled at
Americans be like : MAKE THE LINESO STRAIGHT THAT IT WOULD BE HOMOPHOBIC
During the war for independence the Americans sent a letter to the Canadian colonies demanding they join them calling them a “small and fragile people” this definitely played into why Canada refused to side with America in the war for independence
7:58 that bar hit hard
sharons cat must have talked to god about the expansion
Drake is Canadian
America does diplomacy like ancient rome😂 I can’t tell if this is the best or worst strategy ever.
Watched this while crunk off the claws the ending had me ready to enlist and petition to invade canada
"why not snuggle me?" WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT-
This man gathered more support for a war than most politicians can.
Bro made me laugh for entirely a half n hour
I swear I’ve seen this 100 times and it never gets old
Thank you for describing properly the ill fated general Pickett. He did what many European generals did duriong WW1 with the same result: Not only defeat, but a horrible massacre. He was an idiot, no doubt. And those generals repeating his stupid charge during the whole WW1, year after year, even more idiots.
As a Brit, I can confirm that the British taking the flagpole as one last "screw you" is the most British thing ever.
Most of this is just anti American propaganda
Why did you have to put Florida there….
Only thing biden is coming with, is dementia, and scraped elbows.
where is da punic war 2
Im from england and this made me feel pride for the us
10:56  😮😮 Big mole 😮😮
Sen yusuf kayalp çakmasısız
us Canadian americans have the world with us and we arent smug plus we dont even say sorry all the time edit: i can prob make an oversimplified plushie edit: *this video was taken down for being threatening and offrnsive*
ima make the plushie outta cotton and felt cuz its so simple
3:37 so THATS the density of the US.... Been wondering...
I am an Indian but you have to make video about India or else I'll eat your eyes
31:02
Best ever transition from video content to sponsor advertisement! Give him a prize!
As a British person, this video makes me very annoyed at americans
Plot twist, Oversimplified is actually Canadian
16:36
As an indian i expected more bloodshed from the two of you. 😂 with each other
😂😂 this video was a masterpiece 👌
Can you do a video about georgia?(the country)
I cant believe that america and britian went to germany to solve their proplem
Removing the flag pole as British troop withdrew is the most hilariously petty thing I’ve heard
Lol, I know it's a joke, but as a Canadian, I say bring it you Americans.
Its been nearly two years... and i still sleep with one eye open...
Oh hey I didn't know you were covering the Ukraine war this soon!  oh....oh! never mind
37:13 Considering that Canada (technically Britain and its colony at the time) successfully mounted an invasion of the United States and burned down the original white house, the Canadians have a 1:0 invasion victory over the US in invading the other. It's incredible the US let that slide, long term.
That ending 😂
The end war scrazy.
7:57
is in the middle
31:58 Come on motherfucker, PULL THE TRIGGER! LET'S GO SHOOT ME, SHOOT ME!
How did spuddy get Sonic's shoes?
George Carlin would have been a great actor to play general harney
:)
Your sense of humor is cringe and a bit childish
7:25
dont give ideas to the US please. i dont need to be invaded !
LOL  LOL  LOL
I agree invade canada
3:32 - Look at Florida for a second
This whole war started because of some idiots
Forum Weapon: 19:26-19:28
Straight Line? 🤔 Straight Line. 😃👍
Only thing I learned is that we must nuke Canada and take over, 'Merica !!!!
Were coming for you Canadians
7:58 really just singing, try hitting the grounds cause they never stop coming, they go and go until it’s ready.
goodness sake I am not Canada. But you ga ga say I am some what of a sassy Pig.  But  If a war do  came Between USA and Canada will you be on the sassy pig or the yummy eye sheep? (I do not eat eyes) I be on the side of the pigs
me after watching the last part of this video: dude uncool
i iked the all star reference
It’s my density???lol usa

Oversimplified......  HI!
I love how at the end of the video this guy can go from calm as usual to sounding like he’s about to shoot a pig.
"Shot the pig" definitely sounds like a euphemism for doing something rash you come to immediately regret.
At 0:50, I accidentally skipped to the end of the video. I like to imagine that this is actually how it ended.
1:30 “the candian colony’s to join usa” lol they can’t win sh whit us Canadians and you couldn’t take are country LOL USA YOU STILL GONA SAY YOU WON 1812? AND PIG WAR you’re joking. We KICK YOU’RE ASS IN BOTH!!
I miss oversimplified
What's up to US hate in these videos
Anyone know the name of the song at 7:25? I'd really appreciate it if so :)
nato has left the chat         no joke though that ending was funny as hell
37:15 That’s what Russia thought about Ukraine and look where they are now
Why does America love war so much
No maidens? 8:35
USA IS SO DAMB
When’s the second Punic war
I love that ending. Hands down, one of the best oversimplified episodes.. 1 year later and its still so entertaining.
"..." "..." "Straight line?" "Straight line."
you guys are awesome at making this stuff. keep continuing working on histroy.
During the straight line thing there is a table which has a map of south east Asia on it🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
We need the Vietnam oversimplified!!!
McDonald’s and b2s hahahahahahaha
I think you’d have another Ireland there bud 😂
7:57
29:54 ah yes, the negotiator General scott
7:14 he's testing my hearing skills 24:51 what if the B was silent
The San Juan Porcine Crisis, averted war after cooler heads prevailed.
It's always a crazy story when America is involved
I never got why it's supposed to be White people's fault that the Indians were so bad at fighting.
but did charles griffin get justices for his beloved pig? the 100 dollars?
The left one and the American owner
"I hear voices ALL the time" hahahaha
Does anyone know what music plays between 19:13 to 19:25
They should of just used the middle channel
I like how a war that deserves to be around 40% longer than the biggest war that ever happened ww2  (29-38 minutes) was started because of a pig eating potatoes and 80.33$
today would be I guessing my ninth time watching this video and the rascuel cowboy still gets me
As always, Germany secured world peace in the end.
3:39  erm achtually i believe you meant destiny and not density 🤓
10:10 anyone else saw Napoleon??
9:38 this looks like a really good game map. Like a red vs blue shooter/ctf game. The middle channel would be the middle point where all the action is at.
7:57
MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE !
12:10  like ayo
3:35 why did you have to put it there- 7:15 ah yes perfect meal
bruh... that ending got me! perfection
14:30
Oversimplified should have text emojis
It's depressing looking at this history
Fight Canada? Not with their war crime record
Wow, the ending scared me even though i live somewhere in the middle of Europe...
680 spys
20:00 That music is good
In 1:55 the two guys thinking infront of the us map look like john lennon
Straight line?
37:00
Dude, we want a new video rn
I love that ending. Hands down, one of the best oversimplified episodes.
You know if Biden invade Canada a NATO state that îs impossible
7:09
And then, after sniffing a kid,  he forgot why he was up there
32:19 - 32:30 SUCH AN ASSHOLE 🇺🇸🇺🇸
30:57 - 31:17 SO EVIL AND CREUL 😂😈
Can't tell if ur British or Canadian but the hate for America there is real
7:24 *Bri'ish, not british
In serbia we have pig war too
Me: I dont think im very patriotic.  37:13: Me when i watch a country marble race video
oversimpfied saying what the fu- is always a catch that gets me
Canadian commie claptrap
when the words "American general" were spoken, I knew this was gonna get even worse.
I hate brits, but here I hate murica cause they killed the piggy
I have adhd and I watch your channel a lot because it's funny and I can do chores while listening, however, IVE HEARD THEM ALL 20 TIMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE MORE PLEASE THEYRE AWESOME YOURE AWESOME PLEASE ❤
You should do a history video on Secretariat. He was alive during the Cold War.
i think that i know that channel said 9:35, the treaty said that it seperate from the vancouver island it may means that the channel said that is faro strait
It's pretty funny to me he calls them "the islands" because there is a bit of a weird naming convention here. That big island he is talking about is indeed called San Jaun Island. However, the collection of disputed islands are also called The San Jaun Islands (dispite each Island having their own proper name). Anyways, Washington State has a pretty robust ferry system that can easily get you and your car out there if you wanna visit to see the main town, the lavender farms, and the two forts established by the British and Americans because of this very conflict. You know, very serene stuff
Fun fact about me, I grew up in the town across the river from Portland called Vancouver (where Fort Vancouver is) and NOT Vancouver B.C. as so many people think.
2:35 why does this picture have to be so funny?
Yes, sir Biden’s coming there to invade Canada
America's absolutely no good.😤😰
Amazing how he smuggles his ads in the story. Love it lol
BAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
Dude just started a war between the US and Canada💀
That ending made me regret moving to Canada
White people man
19:13 "killed your pig....."  _proceeds to go into a vision_
1:22 - 1:27 top 10 best anime defeats of all time
7:14 i choked hearing that
15:36 hold up is that a Camaro?
ROBLOX IS OFFICIALLY ON THE QUEST 2
10/10 video
I can't be the only one who as soon as they saw the pig I thought of Angry Birds Star Wars
Affordable insulin? How much is insulin in the US that it is considered affordable in Canada?
4:13 Mae me laugh to death
you must make a Yugoslavia Wars episode (Croatian War of Independence)
I don't say white people
I don’t think I will ever again hear oversimplified speak with such ferocity and determination, and I am inspired. DOWN WITH CANADA!!!
This video should be called 1812 Revisionist History. The United States didn't attack York (modern day Toronto) because of greed. The Brits for years were seizing American merchant ships and impressing them to fight a war for England. English territories were attacked to send a message to the English king which was also controversial in the 13 colonies at the time.
HELLO IM A CANADIAN WE HAVE CANADIAN GEESE WANNA GO
Oversimplified: 'America wanted to expand'  Me: America wanted to grow a dick
Average Human disagreement. Pig gets shot. Almost started a war.
7:32 8:24 10:26 16:33 16:36 19:33 25:10 29:17
10:26 SHUT UP!
its the ending for me 😂
The ending😂😂
Crazy? I was crazy once. They put me in a room, a rubber room full of rats! And rats make me crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once. They put me in a room, a rubber room full of bats! And bats make me crazy!
“I’ve got my spotted dick, a spice girls fan club membership, and an unrelenting negative outlook on live that effects everyone around me” -Oversimplified
A true patriot 😂😂😂
That Canada rant at the end was gold 😂
U *gunshot* S *gunshot* A *gunshot*
9:19-9:21 *Douglas after noticing somebody peeping on him:* *SCREECH*
Funnily enough, I’m actually subscribed to a couple of Canadian YouTube channels. How a(boat) that eh.
BIDENS CUMING BABYYYYYY!!!!!! YEAAAAA
37:17 Oversimplified is a Canadian Killer.
Bro just make canda not allies with the us
hey you could talk about canada more we did do alot in ww1 and ww2. with USA joining last both times. so you could be nice and do one
thank you for the video its very funny
Straight line? Straight line.
Occupy Canada and we will be worse for you than a thousand Vietnams.
32:38
Dude. Let’s invade Canada.
Love your vids, but I doubt you'd equate the expansion and spread of say, the Mongolian Empire, to rats and diseases. 3:39 I'd be curious to see if you've described any other race throughout history that has invaded and conquered in a manner that's dehumanizing to the whole race. Again, love the vids.
Gotta love that the way they solved it was "We need an efficient solution? Ask the Germans."
I like how he said that Drake is gonna be their president, while he‘s Canadian xD
10:23 is my favorite part 😂   Edit: is no one going to talk about the fact that the thumbnail looks very similar to a Star Wars poster?
Oversimplified is the goat of history
I LIKE HOW HE SAID 'MEE'
I'd love to see a Video on the Mexican-American War, aswell as the War Of 1812!
Rock
Bro? 3:32
So what happened to this channel?? Its been almost a year since they made a video.
America
Talk about a Bay of Pigs Situation....
I love how Porky is literally Morgan Freeman.  (Edit: 17 LIKES?! Thanks ya'll)
When’s the next video coming?
1 year later, the only things Biden have invaded have been Dreamland and the personal spaces of children. Let's see how this goes.
4:12
Come on USA, Canadians awaits your invasion. We’ll kick your ass like it’s 1812 all over again.
Okay I almost hate this if Canada declares war on the USA, I’ll declare war on both countries
THE MIDDLE
37:19 bro entered his villian arc 💀
“I never said they were white people!”  Caught me off guard💀
Only thing that Biden's coming with is a nice heart attack because he would treat us all ice cream cuz you guys are freaking ice cream button in his office
Pigs oink oink
America when it’s got legs is kinda sus when u look at Florida 😳
30:15 wonder if his gout was acting up?🤔
we have the war of the bucket, and we have the pig war, now we need a video on the pastry war to complete the trilogy of wars started for stupid reasons
There should be a merch item for spaghetti jeff
Excuse me, but do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior; God Usopp?
I'm looking forward to that Vietnam War video you keep hinting at.
If the US tried to invade Canada to claim it, but it failed... that would make it a British victory, not a draw.

3:37 Its my density LOL
So fun fact: I may or may not have decided to vacation on San Juan Island and Victoria because of this video……..
7:56 all star real
37:40   I remember SCREAMING at this part.
The slow transition from rationality to anger and overall insanity at the end is beautiful. I've watched it 40 times and I have wept every one of them. God bless America for we must manifest our destiny. o7
8:48 12:53
The end has matured like fresh milk...  Biden can't come to grips even with reading out of his own teleprojector, let alone come to invade Canada...  On the other hand, Trudeau is making sure that the Canadians' lives are miserable as possible, soo...
its joever for canada
If America invades Canada, im going to show up at you're doorstep...          ...And poke you. This is a promise
If they came into Canada they would be defeated by General winter
Nice burn bri’ish
5:57 got me dying lol
America would probably not invade Canada because Canada is an ally of America
All Biden will do is sleep
13:06
I love this video because it was posted right before my birthday
Over simplified is the best
🎉
Well hek,why stop their, why not o I don't know go south and invaded Mexico!😋
Straight line?
You know I'm sure the US could win vs Canada during an invasion but there's just no reason to XD.
i love the fact that im watching this video again on the 4th of July, it just makes the ending so much better
That moment when you realize if lyman wasnt lazy is if this didnt happen
33:28 when the doom music kicks in
Douglas and Harney are like kids fighting each other in the school playground while Baynes and Scott are their parents that stop the fighting as they come back from work to pick them up.
I wudde like a altsimplified Chanel wear he made videos about alt history like kaiserrich and fallout estestra. That wudde be awesome
I  enjoyed watching this so much. Can you please make one on vietnam war?
"and god said, spread forth and multiply, like rats, or a plague even"   amen
No wonder this dude hasn't done a video in years...he voted Biden
35:34 Oversimplified should make a video about the Fenian raids. Basically, Irish republicans attacked Canada from US territory from 1866 to 1871.
33:28
im 25 and i have and i been looking forstuff about history for 4 years and this is the best
DAR descendant speaking on here. America isn’t standing for keeping us from freedom of speech 🇺🇸. Benedict Arnold can kiss our ass!
33:29 bro was waiting 💀
33:33 it is safe to say that Harney's actions angered General Wifield Scott greatly, who punished him severely
YEAH LETS GOO MURICA 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
The propaganda runs high in this video.....
aaaaaa oversimplified coolcoolcooc
you ok man?  37:06
Wow, what a “War”.
7:12
Bud rapped for 5 seconds
Harney the Hard-Headed Idiot
If anyone cared, 27:27 he did indeed change the colors of the islands. Love the detail. 🎉
"Oh, back to war they go"  Human history in a nutshell
32:29- 32:43 the funni part and hilarious scene for memes (my opinion)
Im so happy about this ending!
14:36 and 33:12 😂😂
No invade on indonesia eh... noice
BUCHANAN!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TECHNOBLADE SHOULDN'T DIE!!!!!!!!!!
0:55 love the Star Wars reference
the end got a little over the top.
As a german i find it so hilarious that our emperor could decide what happened to the island
7:57 the best part
I think he’s a big gurl guys 29:41
I loveeee your videos. History is no longer boring. ❤😂
1:23 OHHHHHH!
Removing the flag pole so that your oppenent can’t stick up his flag is the kind of pity warfare i admire 😂
"Biden is coming with a vengeance." Bro, the only the only thing Biden is coming in is little boys. 😂
the banana wars.
❤
Good ole Oversimplified, never change. A well researched video, presented in a light heart manner, with a casual ad to conquer Canada at the end. That's why im here.
i love that he goes into all the details of the background of a usually skimmed event.
29:15 not the curtain again Mr president 😂
I am so down for American Mounty's.  Shit would be mad.  Also, does anyone actually believe we aren't absorbing Canada in the next 100 years?  Nonsense. Canada is ours by 2123. Big facts.
he went a bit American at last :D
MANIFEST DESTINYYYYYY 🇺🇸🇺🇸
I will have you know that I just ran into an out-of-context portrait and went, “…is that Pickett?” And it was. I RECOGNIZED PICKETT BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO.
That finale made the entire video worth watching 😂 I think we should invade! I’d be in support! I’ve always thought they’re too smug!! Not to mention their leader is a moron and a terrorist 🤷🏼‍♀️
30:55 - 31:08
I swear general Harney has main character syndrome
Oh i am sorry is that too much to ask princess?!
the way he made a reference to the song all stars was hilarious
Calm down America, It would just be a war crime fest
FREEEDOOMMMMM!!!!!!!!!
Cleanest sponsor transition I’ve ever seen
Oversimplified Dude should get a Hollywood Movie as a voice actor...
36:22 That's f'n hilarious...🤣
29:12  Lmfao
The middle channel
Some say that Buchanan is still behind the curtain to this day
I have a good a Mexican American war oversimplified
7:57 This Is What You Came For
Bro I live in the San Juan’s 🫡
I find it rather interesting that a common theme in American colonization and expansion is people fleeing overpopulated areas and out-populating the people who already live where they're headed.
You should have mentioned the nearby Strait of Juan de Fuca has a tiny segment that *to this day* remains a point of contention between the US and Canada, thusbproviding the (unlikely) grounds for the proposed canada v us war at the end 😂
36:00 Nah im sure the islands are made for  the glorious british empire
does anyone know the music that plays at 7:25 in the background quietly while the ship shows up?
Why am I watching this on summer vacation
32:08  33:29
Hawaiian shepherds on some remote islands in Canada has to be one of the most random things ever lol. Talk about a culture shock.
"With just a click of a button, you can head on over to South Korea and watch every single BTS video known to mankind." I feel personally attacked, Oversimplified 🤣🤣🤣🤣
great video, but one thing has been bugging me firstly fairs play with using the colors of an actual modern berkshire but berkshires used to be ginger with black spots back then( no really they were)
The flag pole removal was an absolute chef's kiss.
this just foreshadow world war 1 but it did not happened and instead of a man it's a pig.
16:36 Another "Noooooo!"
Joe biden is called sleepy half dead princess joey
Love the dramatic scene of the birds flying from the tree after the gunshot to the pig
This aged amazingly with Canada’s new attack on the United States lol via wild fires
Summary of this video: basically the Americans do not want to compromise ...
I will never understand why Americans call the war of 1812 a draw.   We tried to invade Canada: unsuccessfully.  They invaded our capital.  Our troops were starving and freezing so we gave up AND the Canadians literally gave us supplies to go home.   That’s not a draw 😂 we got our butts whooped.
bro lost his mind in end XD.................LOL!!!!!!
The ending was probably the most patriotic thing I have ever seen. God bless America✊🦅🔥💯🔛🔝
Technoblade origin story
bro biden is gonna fall over when he trys
0:01
Anyone notice the calculator at 14:29?
Invade Canada if you wnat but not Quebec !!!!!
29:38  Therapist: Oversimplified hands on hips isn't real. He can't hurt you Oversimplified with hands on hips
Learned more from this channel than all of highschool history
BUCHANAN
cannot get enough of the sign-off on this one. Biden, with a vengence.
what a bomb ass ending to end the show !
Feel like invading Canada is more plausible after these Wildfires that spread to NY. How dare they?
i have never heard of a stupider war ever i thought football war is crazy  war over a freaking pig lol
It’s so funny that this war was over a pig
President: General Scott, can you please deal with the war in the north west? Scott: I can't- President: Your gout is acting up? Scott: My gout is acting up.  Oversimplified: That's called a reference. 🙂
*hears the name pickett*  *History major brain goes off*  *Starts actively rootimg for his ass to be humuliated*
Sepirate the Continent from Vancouver's islander
When you talked about the boundaries settlement it says SEPARATE THE conto
You deserve 10M subs
Oversimplified if nordvpn or honey doesn’t sponsor him😩🥺😭
Petition for the Mexican and American war.
I did same place lol
The part where he says Canadians or something
What the Fu...
I love how the British and the US, just have war over anything, and then comes the British and the Danish which just put alcohol on the island and periodicly pick up one bottle left by the other side.
American can try.. but they wont be laughing when we cover their cities in maple syrup.. you'll be as sticky as the Boston flood of molasses..
🙄 wow, what a new liberal take on the founders “ThEY weRe RACIST! 😢🤤”…. Give it a break for one minute and that word might gain back some meaning. As of now it has lost all of its sting. I think that when libs decided that a dog on Twitter was racist is when you completely jumped the shark. Could be the utter redefining of it to make sure that no one but white ppl can be racist though 🤣🤔….not sure.
Still don’t understand why we haven’t taken Canada and Mexico. As far as the people’s republic of Canada is concerned it would be liberating them.
31:03 33:23
I'd love to see a Mini War about the War of 1812, if you ever get around to it. Thanks for all your hard work!
He litterly declared war at the end
oversimplified is the embodiment of “quality over quantity”
I love how no one is realising about  the rhythm from 7:58 to 8:06
I can see this being adapted into a Comedy with Adam Driver playing Pickett and John Malkovich playing Harney.
14:36  hahahahaha
The magic pig
i hate canada！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
all American
36:57
This is human nature I guess 😂😂
Если Байден придет в Канаду,то он просто забудет зачем он пришел.  If Biden comes to Canada, he’ll just forget why he came.
Oh god
1:04 35:49. What
i feel like its obvioous that it should be the Brittish Island, like america got so much when they just cut everything in a line at the end so they should just have given the island/islands to the brittish
romania lore when
Is this the reson oversimplified doesn’t make a video about Canada??
37:19
37:12
He spent 38 minutes of his life to talk about a shooting of a pig
take it easy bro on these canadians
37:52 was funny LOL
37:35 was too much patriotic.
Short version, we won 2 wars and this arguement also with britian. The make of this video only studies one side to history, he is biased and dont like America.
0:33 anyone see the banner that looks like the russia flag on the wall?
3:53 I love this part. Not only can we clearly hear three people placing the responsibility on three other people, but the second one is a cat, and the third one is a schizophrenic
I fricking love the end part😃
33:29
Hilarious 😂
War of 1812 oversimplified
Good video oversimplified
14:36
We dont invade Canada, because the suck.
I’m from Vancouver
It means the middle channel
Spuddy was wearing Sonic’s shoes.
LOL. OMG I never did watch the end of the video till now. Ya. Watch your back, dirty Canucks! EH??!! LOL. JK. Love to all...
33:13
They should’ve just had it be neutral ground
10:58 Mole! Mole! Mole! Mole!
"I didn't say they were WHITE people" All those times Britain invaded France must have been because the Brits thought the French weren't white enough or something idk.
As we delve further and further into the Biden Regime, this is aging like cheese.  Biden can barely handle getting out of bed in the morning, much less invade Canada unsuccessfully.
Falklands before falklands we’re cool
Oooooohhhh NNnnnooooOooo
Hey can I ask where you got your information from I am doing a report for school
Good All Star quote there
You boys don't want no trouble coming up here eh.
But they’re both in NATO so they’ll never fight 😂
Wow, video doesn't show a bias at allllllll.....
I live in Upper Fartington. It smells here.....
I am Canadian but this was still an amazing funny video Nice job oversimplified!
(POV: the end)AMERICA 🇺🇸
I think that was the funniest so far (neither american or canadian or brit)
I was shocked to see history from my home region being covered! This is fantastic!
That start tho?
hahaha did anyone catch someone say "I hear voices all the time" at 3:52? haha gets me every time
3:32 I'm REALLY sorry, but it looks like America just grew a wiener.
But like isn't the British in Canada and "American" in America aren't they from British 💀
😂😂😂😂
*laughs in canadian*
Sleepy Joe vs Canada true epic battle
4:14 I think I know where that it… kinda reminds me of a place near or in the Yakima reservation
To all Canadians, you're safe :)
I thought america started wars out of thin air only recently
2:34 And the British burned down The White House
I love how Oversimplified spent 14 minutes on one of the greatest conflicts in history and then he spent 38 minutes on a bunch of pigs eating potatoes in Canada😂
31:25 I love how the potatoes eyes were moving when the pig walked over and that his face kept changing
WHAT
Did Morgan Freeman actually voice the line the pig spoke before Lyman killed him
Early on in the video we see Mexico, they are represented as green. We also see the islands. They are green... Thus Oversimplified thinks the islands belong to Mexico. And as a loyal viewer I agree with your statement Oversimplified.
My family has owned a house in the San Jaun islands since the 50s and I've never known this! We're located on Lopez island. It's not a bad place to visit in case anyone is wanting to see it.
I'm discussed, Canada 🍁 🍁 is better !!!!!!!!
Simon?
Best ending ever, lol. Edit: I thought the pig sounded like Morgan Freeman!
18:44 there is absolutely no reason why this scene should be so clean...but it is very nice.
Kinda sad knowing people us the name of God for these certain things...
Pig=war makes sense
He's finally done Canada... Now let's go with Mexico 👍
Bro the end caught me off guard 😂😂😂😂
i feel now thats in the end was a little dramatic :/
Bigger
Lol no l
Biden finna come at Canada with the Biden Blast!
We are COMING CANADA
37:16-38:21 dude completely gone crazy💀
The deranged schizo rant at the end gets me every time.
32:02  Funnys haha
Hey, I never said that they were WHITE people
I am in Canada bruh.😑
Wait this was a year ago?
When you give hands and legs to america florida looks like a willy bruh💀💀💀
And thats how the American Canadian war started by threats from a youtuber! The end
British were in the right there. The American was stupid to build the house there and plant potatoes even without proper fence. I would make him pay the full amount.
25:08   I died 😂😂😂😂😂
as a Brit, this video was hilarious.
Why did you did you put Florida there? Well, America was eating the burger.
Hehehe! If it wasn't for all of them environmentalists pushing for the world to "go green", I'm sure the US would have eventually invaded Canada for its oil! Hehehe
AMERICA 🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
My man got crazy
I love they tired to arrest him and him being a American had 4 gun's and a knife! I am dead.
3:35 i didn't realize, but florida looks like America's PP
THIS IS OUR MANIFEST DESTINY!!!!!!
When the pig started to talk as Morgan freeman I lost is
31:53 spuddy is disturbed
Please leave the Canadians alone. They don't deserve you threatening their southern border.  2025 Edit: Sweet Mother of Foreshadowing
This man really invented the Dark Brandon meme before it was a thing. A true visionary.
If he spared the pig, he could have used its 3 wishes to bring back spuddy
Hjii😊
What music in 7:25
Is that Mark Twain at 29:21 ?
okay... I was waiting for some Black Sabbath reference here
18:40 Y'know what? Fuck you *pump-actions your double-barrel*
“We have the manpower. We have the arms. IT’S OUR MANIFEST DESTINY”  **US anthem intensifies**
straight line?      straight line...
I don't understand why people insist on calling the War of 1812 a draw. The British won. American did not achieve any of it's goals. The British's clear war goal was to keep Canada and end the war. The British achieved that goal. What do we call it when one side achieves their war goals and the other does not? A victory.
Please consider making your pin designs into velcro patches as well.  That would be sweet!
THE ENDING THOUGH LOL!!!!!!
8:47 most American celebration
0:46 😭
9:38 Well of course it meant the middle channel
One minor detail I barely realized after watching this multiple times is how the American flag's stars change through as the years progress with new states being added.
As a Canadian, I can confirm that this is exactly how the ‘disagreement’ played out. Well done
37:10 Canada will be ours when we get our act together over here
I think OverSimplified has finally lost it.
he did an all star reference
I fell bad for the Canadians watching this Video, We Love you Canada :D
I like how variated Oversimplfied can be, it can be goofy, nice, emotional, then we have this, NATIONALISM
32:32 funniest moment
7:58 That was clean
Is no one gonna talk about the fact in 7:58 sounds familiar
Yo our northern neighbor doesn't want no smoke. Shit, most of the world. When it's in trouble, They call us, US mf A! Shit, no one want that smoke. Even our enemies on their tippy toes.
that was bacon up some heroic actions at the end
DARK BRANDON TAKEOVER  FINISH THE JOB....THE JOB OF OUR MANIFESTING DESTINY!!!
This war could of been preventable lol 😂 I like the straight line idea and who cares who gets the small island
The pig looks like waddles from gravity falls
"And who was it who spoke to god?"  "I thought it was Billy" "Wasn't it Sharon's cat?" "I hear voices all the time" LOL
Invade Canada and we Brits will probably declare war
Well... This dbag content creator hates the U.S.
Bro really covered “the pig war” before the war of 1812
love you oversimplified
No Tecumseh?  This crap is on my YouTube feed and you thought we got America from the English?
I'm proud to be an American
Canadian here. Come get us ya effing yank. (/j) (No please dont actually im worried we might invent new warcrimes again. SAVE YOURSELVES!)
so funny i like your videos
And with that the 13 commonwealth of the United States of America was born… Wait a minute, that’s the fall out universe!
Canadians and Americans are friends what do you think
Canada I live in Canada
32:39 Me explaining to people what the furry community is
charles griffin looks like the weeknd in scottish font
38:12 man this ain’t scary now with bidens dementia basically preventing him from trying to invade us because he will forget his reason to justify a war against us
America 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
I got an ad for something to beat swine heat stress. THEY KNOW
We need more videos
RAHHHHHHHH 🦅🦅🦅
3:53 "I hear voices all the time." Huh, ok.
That Smash Mouth reference was golden 😎👍🏼
Hell no
So glad early Americans were like toddlers and never agreed to a compromise or else I'd be Canadian and couldn't exercise my AMERICAN RIGHTS.
hello I am Noraiz I am a fan of your vedios i request you if you could post vedios on indian history example- .the 1857 revolution .the east indian company .Indigo revolt .freedom of india .the cholan empire and many more it would be good of you if you post this historical vedios
I don’t think the US has invade Canada, they stole the cup thirty years ago, that’s the worst they could have done anyway
Humans will go to war over literally anything
Lazy as pie, don’t think I’ve ever heard that one before
7:30
Noooooooooo
My god, that ending is somehow the most hilarious yet simultaneously patriotic speech I’ve ever heard. That said, affordable insulin and copious amounts of maple syrup does sound nice…
what ths f-
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
11:07
37:23 THATS EXACTLY WHAT IVE BEEN SAYIN! WE CAN ALSO TAKEOVER MEXICO! THEN AUSTRALIA! THEN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hey can you tell the history of philippines
caaaaaaaaaaaanada is invaded  by usa and his friend philippines
Now that I think about it, the boundary commisions dude for america pulled out an AK-47...a Soviet Kalashinikov.
This whole war was extremely stupid…  The British negotiated for ALL the islands.  They’re just being clowns by not giving the British the islands in the first place.
I just sailed past these islands. They do not look like something worth a war with the UK...
I love that they just slap down a McDonald’s and say American
Sup from Russian who live in great Canada.  If you try invite it (Putin will fuck your ass ) and me too.  Have a great day everyone do not start war ! Peace 🕊️✌️🕊️
5:46 lol using flags as doormats what a disgrace 😒😒🤢🤮
you should make a cereal called Bucket o' cereal with oversimplified activities and jokes on the back
This whole video is gold.
6:16 He has 5
The ending Is hilaroius ngl.
There is no way that the U.S. would invade its ally, Canada. LoL
5:52 SPONSOR TIME  *WELL THEN YOU MY FREIND, SHOULD USE NORDVPN WHAT THE FU--*
5:18 *AND THERES NO WAY IM EVER GONNA AGREE TO IT (SLAPS BRITISH GUY CAUSE MANIFEST DESTINYYYYY)*
27:30 One of the islands doesn't change color.
Literally they went to German Empire 😂😂😂
He puts VPN in every video😂😂😂 talented

bruuu
"wayne gretsky waving american flag"
36:26 dope 🛐
9:21 😂😂😂lol
Ok the beginning segment of that video was all we needed, no more education required
The Treaty of Oregon in 1846 the treaty said " To the middle of Said Channel " so the treaty wanted the American and British to half the islands.
10:26 That's one way of shutting up a court.
1:21 Bro got roasted.
The ending to this video is too good
Education - 90% Learning history - 95% Stupidity - 60% Lose brain cells - INFINITY
Wait, who’s Biden?
If America ever actually invades Canada OverSimplified is gonna get arrested for inciting a war XD
Respect to that captain 🫡
California Sacramento war
Sacramento  war
I’m concerned for that one guy that said “I hear voices all the time😂
8:49 me an american to anyone not american. XD
19:12 This scene would make me cringe but it has oversimplified charm into it that's its funny
21:21 Song?
Hi can you do mexican american war
THis is gonna sound weird but... What's the music at 3:21??
7:32 NOOOOO!!!! 16:36 NOOOOO!!!
For the end. thing is, US and Canada are allies
8:48 made me laugh so hard 💀💀💀
Joe bidens cray—cray😂😂
7:25 yeehaw! Grab a cold one and let's enjoy this American land. Let's toss some tea in the water while we're at it, y'all! ~🤠🇺🇸🦅💪🏻☕️ 🌊
Have y’all ever noticed that the nord vpn logo looks like blue hair on an oversimplified character?
Pin this if you support your sponsors (please, if u do it my dad will be proud)
3:32 America grew some long things 😉
So when are we taking Mexico and Canada? I want to manifest that destiny.
9:26 It is in my belief that the line is supposed to go through the middle channel. It says "middle channel," so it must mean the center channel. But that's just my opinion. What do you all think?
11:38
Make the Zulu war
change the channel name to over-cuck-tified...
Honestly we should invade Canada and kick those French speakin son guns out. We’ll show’em what Freeedom really means 🦅
this just goes to show us that idiots in power can destroy millions of lives just like ww1 and ww2
You should talk about the Middle East
1:25
Canada will kick your ass Bucket head
Biden will f...k this up too.
Omg- my friend recommended this to me, this is absolutely hilarious. RIP pig
at 5:01 bro jumped higher then ronaldo and messi combined
The most accurate cowboy stupidity EVER 😂
I hate that Oversimplified is a Democrat
*"and thus an all out war was started with a single youtube video"*
Face reveal needed at 10 mil
BUCHANAN!!!
I need a new video!
These videos are just elite lol
32:38
In the end he was going crazy
You know you’re a YouTuber whenever you get sponsored by Nord VPN
Day 3 of asking for Vietnam war oversimplified
America this is why your youth will continue to hurt itself
Indians: "You realize we live here right? I have buried 13 friends in The ground beneath your golf course."
4:18 American Lebenstraum
"Alright you psychopath" and the scream animation that follows gets me every time 😂😂😂😂
YEEEEEEHAAAAA
7:32, 16:36 NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Legends say that Douglas is still not happy with the decision 😂
HEY            im Canadian that hurt my feelings
I've never been so proud to be able to own these islands I've never heard of.
38:00 seeing those comments i think canada should get invaded cause the comments act like canada is more important then america if your canadian you do not get where im going with this
Did one person say that god told Sherman’s cat that is was usa’s destiny?
7:57 oversimplified dropped a fire beat 🔥💯🥶  Btw this is a joke if people can’t understand it
Ah yes, war over a pig (and because of idiots)
Cqme here after some yandere ASMR. Yes i know its a wierd combination but whatever right?
Best vid from oversimplified so far
I was really upset because modern geography spoiled the ending for me!😄 Love the videos!
The NordVPN commercial 😂
the USA will probably not invade Canada, ever since it was an ally, so, Maybe say that to yourself
Canada should invade the US~ (make this a reality, pls)
ya you had way to much fun with this video 31:49 27:41 sounds like you  33:29 with the girl scream 🤣🤣🤣🤣
biden was coming with a vengance but he ended up forgetting the whole thing once he saw the ice cream truck that drove by
Lol “Surrender pronto…or I’ll level Toronto” —President Alan Alda
Oh, hey Oversimplified, you are possibly the greatest history teacher in all of time.  Correction: definitely the greatest   But shouldn't you also talk about India in your videos or probably make some on it. Like literally it's one of the oldest civilizations in history.  Anyway, I am possibly your greatest fan. Ah wait!! definitely the greatest.🙋🏾‍♂️🙋🏾‍♂️🇮🇳🇮🇳
Ex ss Z zzz a zil
31:-03, that pig sounded like Morgan Freeman
Lol
Wow
LoL the ending
Finally i have watched all your videos in a spree and this is the last one, and is awesome as always.
I literally live, born and raised, on Vancouver island and I knew none of this. I’ve always wondered about why some of the island in the straight are Canadian and others are American. Thanks for this
5:56 What the f-
Woah woah woah , they aren’t white , YEAHHH”
Winfield Scott kicking Harneys teeth in is the best damn part
pls stop with the little jabs at america and our history, "like rats" or "disease". your american, you enjoy the freedoms and luxurys you have today because of what happened in the past. not all of it is right, but it happened. please, be more respectful and if anything just tell the story how it is without the passive aggressiveness.
That nord VPN cut was soooooo dang good I watched the who spot
37:15 to 38:23 My favourite scene lol, despite being British
Lyman: I'll just fence in three sides and hope these British farm animals have a moral compass and respect my property rights. Porky: Which gives me many potatoes. Delicious potatoes. *digs up and eats one* Yummy yummy for my fat little pig tummy.
the ending.... were comin canada ):)
MURICAA Biden's coming baby, and this time with vengeance.
Worst episode to date
9 years ago I watched this video. 4 years later, I got summoned as a juror. I made it clear on my questionnaire that I knew about nullification. The judge questioned me about it during voir dire, and then asked if I could be impartial for this particular crime, to which I said yes. I was the first peremptory challenge from the DA, even before the guy who loudly exclaimed that he didn't trust police at all.
Jesus Loves Yall ❤️
That be the way in which things are eh?
Me being Texan and seeing the Repubic of Texas in the Background.😁😁😁
to be very serious this video shows how professional the royal navy was
I think the manifest destiny was a lie
37:19  Beginning of the USA taking the North America continent
pig voice guy sounds hot
Waaaait... what happened to the pig's body? Did the potato farmer keep and consumed the body, sell its meat? Why did the other guy want 100 bucks? Didnt the potato farmer return the body?
Did anyone notice that Spuddy was wearing Sonic's shoes?
NO CANDADA IS AMRICANS BROTHER THATS ######
The last time America tried to invade Canada, we burned down the White House
0:48  No way Oversimplified💀
Who else thought Morgan freeman voiced the pig??
13:28 when he said, "BAAAAAAHHHH"... I felt that.
As a good ol' American hating Canadian (sorry boys its a joke, but keep oot), best ending of any video.
9:27 let's play who can spot the border issue (hint: point Roberts)
”Irish man”? ”Griffin”?  Doesnt that sound familiar?
I truly love the pettiness of the British to steal the flagpole as they left
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
bros animation is going to Disney level
“It’s my density” -USA
The intro and exit outro song is really really catchy lol Idk if you made it or what but I love it. Keep on keepin on brother!!
That be way in which thing be the way they are?😂😂😂
Unironically if the US invaded Canada the US would probably be wiped out. NATO would turn on the US and Russia would join in as well most likely
We would just burn down the white house again
I've never felt more represented as a 'gun slinging, howdy neighboring, diarrhea having American.' Thank you. I'm so proud.
Yes 😂😂😂
7:58
As an American, we don't want Canada.
White people invaded other white people read a book moron
Given that I grew up just north of bellingham in the US, I can't imagine how this ends hahaha
Russia owning Alaska at the time just watching all the drama
That ending was the most beautiful and hilarious thing I've ever seen thank you for the laughs here in this video and is every other
ALSO MORE STUPID WARS AND NEAR WAR
18:48 bro sounded infuriated  💀
BUCHANAN?
My man has 666 subscribers 💀
Having trouble makin* videos in under 6th months USE NORD VPN
HOW THE HECK YOU GOT B21 RAIDERS SO FAR BACK BEFORE THE AIRPLANE WAS EVEN INVENTED AND WHERE THE HECK DID THEY GET TOPSENS LOL
At the time I am watching this video, it has 666k likes
Holy shut the “baaaaaahhaaaaa baaa” with the sheep to person to sheep has me dead ☠️ hahahahahaha 😂 soo fucking funny
4:14 B-2 spirits makes sense
What's the name of the fife and drum that plays when the Americans show up?
3 vytt
Oofffff
Lol yeah you can get to 10m
Imagine warmongering your way around the entire globe, sanctioning every country that doesn't do what you want and then thinking you can teach ppl "democracy". narcissistic hypocrites
Sometimes when I'm talking to my friends I say we should go back to war with the Americans over that pig that they killed.
Me knowing that it went to the Americans because I didn't have to colour in those islands on my grade 9 geography map.
Idk why Pickett reminds me of Post Malone
Seeing Charles Griffin in love with a pig is... Feeling to familiar with our times.
If America was to invade Canada....we'd drive them out with our politeness, apologies and excessive amounts of Maple Syrup and Tim Hortons Coffee....
18:31 _le guy laugh_
watching this when theres 666k likes
32.30 - 32.40. i recognize that feeling from work 😅
@ 5:00 Did Nixon fear a left-wing populist wave like in France, Russia, and China?   Did he fear that "the hippies, blacks, gays, and poors" would rise up and chop their heads off with a guillotine?   Can we measure progress by democracy? In 1789, right wing was pro monarchy; in 2000 right wing is pro rich but democracy is the unspoken standard.   Is this a conspiracy theory or  is the ghost of autocracy and human greed echoing from the past?
What a bout Finland
The pig with the Morgan Freeman voice... "Lyman, if you spare my life..." hahahaha...
" Earl of Jizzingham"
666к of likes. Wow
7:57 "But the americans keep coming and don't stop coming" "Hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running" 🎵🎶
Is it just me or did Oversimplified got a little too patriotic in the end 🤔
Damn!
Except that rats have not yet to spread across the continent but humans have.
15:50 veatnom war plans on table
3:50 i thought it was Jonathons cat
Love it
3:38 Florida looking pretty sus there
Best ending to a YouTube video ever! Watch out Canada!
666k likes
OK the second version of how the pig war happened was kind of dark just kind of dark immediately especially that line shoot me
When I commented on this it had 666k likes and I thought that was funny😂
The ending killed me for a second: WE WILL WAVE THE FLAG EVERY FOURTH OF JULY I love that 😂😂🤣
oversimplified: **exists** NordVPN and Honey: is for me?
Why stop with Canada, think about it, Mexico would be next and then South America.
When I watched the end of the video I was like:WHAT DID I JUST WATCH!?!?!?!?!?
The ending was by far one of the most American things I've seen
bro fr entered his villain arc at the end
Fun fact that everyone gets wrong: James Douglas was part African, enough so that his contemporaries saw him as black.
You make the pig war sound like a huge joke 😅😅😅
18:46  was that the shoot of 88?!
I just realized that the islands belong to Mexico bc it’s green and Mexico in the vid was green..
Biden doesn't have vengeance. He's a real christian - the rarest kind of christian
That thumbnail might just be the greatest way to represent this particular topic
I always forget the thumbnail isn't from star wars
7:56 shrek theme
Me cringing at how oversimplified drew First Nations people 😬😬🙄😰?!?! Just… WhY?!? 😓😥 DUUuuDE! COME ON!
5:47 this reminds me the latest news about the US Congress wants to ban tiktok because they can access to see the US Government database.
i think the islands should be American just to piss of the British
My favorite part: And who was it who spoke to god? I thought it was sharon’s cat
37:35 37:38 short but best of tha National anthem
13:58 I feel bad for lmao at this 😂
Lmao, all that because of a freaking pig, Nice ツ
7:32 James Douglas: (Releasing his Demogorgon screech of autism) NNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
I'm from Washington State and had never heard of this incident until I found your chanel.  This is the funniest thing I've ever heard.  I LOVE IT!
never attack canda
33:57 that is very wholesome. The British celebrated the fourth of July! Which may I add was the day America declared independence from the British! And the Americans celebrated Queen Victorias birthday! back in the revolutionary war that would be considered treason to the U.S government, how adorable!
can you make a video about the latin american revolution? it seems that i only learn about history when you make the videos
Oversimplified why you hate the very nice canadians I will sue
17:19 Potato seeds? You use old potatoes, no seeds! there Is no such thing as potato seeds
Why is there a Russian flag
"Oh, I see.  So that's how it is, uh? That's how it's going to be, is it? That's the way in which things are, eh? That be how it will, is it? Will it be how that is, huh? That be the way in which things be the way they are, is it?"  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pig
5:19 AND THERE’S NO WAY I’M EVER GONNA AGREE TO IT!  15:59 And there’s no way I’m ever gonna agree to it!
That all star lyrics gag was actually genius
Kinda bothers me that ppl fight over land they don't really own
Well, I guess he talked about Canda this time.
1:34
Its stat wars With usa and british
3:37 um was I the only one to catch that
16:36 NOOO! 7:32 NOOO!
who noticed the russian flag in the first scene  😀😁
What music at 19:39
3:34 what is Florida doing there.
I love oversimplifieds humour
1:31 join "us" get it? Greatest pun ever.
Keep Comin N Dey Dnt Stop Comin,Hopd In Dere Waagons N Dey Wont Stop Comin Edit:Why did the Bri'ish name their food"Spotted dick"?
0:46 Thomas Jefferson hates him self,but why?
but the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming  hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running  didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon-  as they outnumbered the brit's more than 6 to 1
I love how when the sheriff has the calculator it says boobs on it, Anyone else catch that?
33:29

We’ve missed you OverSimplified 🥹
Watching this on the day where they actually announced Biden is coming to Canada 😂
I've watched your videos a bunch of times but I totally just noticed the america with arms and legs technically has Florida in its rightful place as americas dong.  Well played.
5:53 perfectly cut
You should make a uncool  hoodie

1783
Pov you kill a pig in minecraft and your brother makes you watch this whole video
19:11 was the best moment
If I wasn't part human myself I would never believe that they could be capable of such ruthless idiocy.
OverSimplified be spitting bars
Please do a video on the English civil war that needs simplifying!!!!!!!!!
Like to point out Pickett was against that Charge that named after him. Lee forced it ahead, because of multiple reasons, and the Virginia news paper blamed Pickett for it, because he was only non Virginian commander involved.
I feel offended as a Canadian…
While they’re arguing about who asked God that’s what they were meant to do, expand out West, you can hear “I thought it was Sherman’s cat” if you listen really closely.
Considering the mistake with the fences he made
With out Lyman we wouldn't have this amazing video!
Honestly the best
We had to make a presentation about the Oregon territory and added a pig being shot to it. I don’t think anyone but our group understood why lol
We can't invade Canada cuz of NATO
Yeehaw we Texans will win definitely for ever 🤠
This was the greatest outro by far so far
i think all of the channels
Nice to know the British Parliament hasn't changed.
Islands belong to America because they’re American as apple pie
A war for a pig and an 10000$ island
3:32 america gains a pp from eating a burger, look at his legs
the swine is the one i killed im Lyman 😀😀😀😀
I didn't say they were WHITE people   ded xD
This video about the pig war is longer than WW2..
We're coming canadians
0:45
Did he make an all star reference with at around 7:59
9:36 the middle one. Duh.
5:33 "Well, then you my freind, should use *rips clothes off* NORD VPN!" "what the FU-"
THE BIDEN BLAST!/1/1/!?/1
This video just saved my history grade.🙏
19:08 its his villian Origin story😂
6:21 meh. I'm korean anyway. I live in South Korea!
37:53 this did not age well
Make an Industrial Revilution video🏭🏭.
It's "Bark-Shire" not "Berk-Shire" (the spelling is Berkshire though)
Well I mean, The Treaty said “advance southerly through the middle of said channel.” Now focus on the word “middle”. To me, That sounds like the treaty was saying the line would split the islands apart.
A yes the long foretold Canadianmerican war
The execution at 5:48 is priceless!
usually like this channel but the improv skits like at 12:05 are just corny ngl
My headcanon for America from now on is that the idea of manifest destiny came from Sharon's cat.
What the fuck
Can you pls do a video about the origin of Pi bc today's Pi day? Btw I'm a HUGE fan.
Biden just forgot where he lived since he’s a doddering old fool. Let’s go Brandon, take the canucks!
Hurry up, if we mobilize now we can take Canada before the WBC game ends.
Just saying, that scene at 3:32 doesn't look the best if yk what I mean
22:17 Wait the panama canal wasn't built yet, right?
28:59
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey guys if look at 5:20 and look at the little map in Side you can see it shows a map of the Vietnam war
if for some stupid reason usa would somehow invade canada, i would put a bounty of 1 billion on joe biden 's spine.
why don't you post youtube video's anymore?
"SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN TONIGHT, BECAUSE BIDEN'S COMIN', BABY" -arguably the best quote known to man, Oversimplified 2022
At 5:01, If you look to the left, you will see a map on a table, it is the map of vietnam, hinting a vietnam war video coming soon..
USA AHHH🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅HHHHHH
I just wanna take a moment to appreciate the absolute MASTERPIECE of a thumbnail he made for this video
My guy I live in Canada 🇨🇦  I have lot more problem solve than the American invasion in the future😒
alternative title: saitama vs goku debate
Straight line? Stright line.
All of north and south america will be part of the USA one day. Mark my words.
17:45 potatoes out of his pig
Thank you for pronouncing Oregon correctly, it does all of us from it a smile :3
Watch out Canucks 🫡🇺🇸 37:30
7:58 is the best shrek remix ever💀
The end had me crying
From what I’ve seen from this video, James Douglas is like William S Harney. But instead just hating America, James Douglas really wants America gone for good
RIP spuddy
Boy way to try and make yourself sound like one of the “good” white people with all the self deprecation.
Imagine the americans managing to invade canada
im canadian
When this came out, The smartest kid in the class memorized every word and recited it.  ✨E.       ✨       D   T         I  T          T This post is a year old, pay no attention to it.
we will destroy you all
The treaty is referring to the middle channel.
Lyman. If you spare my life I grant you 3 wishes… 31:05
I hear voices all the time
"Straight line? Straight line!"  ~U.S/Canada border's motto
Damn i hate the united states
69😮
😂
Love the NES controller just randomly sitting there at 16:00
37:18 starts the best part of the video
Canadians watching the end of the video: dying inside
OMG you guys are so funny! 😂🤣 I LOVE watching your videos! ❤
Ah yes density
Straight line? Straight line
i love how oversimplified just put a  russian flag down american flag
Anyone notices that calculator said B00B!3S
Gazing north, looks like a lot of Canadians could use a little liberating.  Too bad we've allowed our own nation to degrade so that they would have to balk at being annexed.
I live in oregon- damn it would be nice if it was actually part of Canada. We might have healthcare lol
What is next video?
Loved how he mentioned South Korea where I from
Spuddy was the most evil food in history  I regret making this comment bro what the fuck?
0:48 I was dying of laughter
7:57 I need a 1 hour version of this.
Was this during the missionary times like the years of the Wild West
😂 Candida I’m so sorry we’re your neighbours XD
I’d rather be a Brit XD
I like how he always uses his videos about Hitler for the Nord VPN advertisement, cuz everyone would know it’s blocked in Germany.
11:44 want’s to clam the ilands for Britain… sends no one British
A really neat high quality pin you can buy on San Juan island has half a Brit flag with half an American flag. owned one for decades on my nice suit. forgot where the suit is now.
"prime agricultural land"......not really. homestead stuff. the south end of San Juan is now farm pasture, hay. the north end is all rock...and wild turkeys with no real meat on them. nice island, though. great harbour on the north end. all US islands have shortage of water issues. The Canadian side is a lot better soil and those islands do have potable water. and nice fishing reefs.
Fine you wanted a straight line theres your straight line 8:46 YEEEEEEHAW
5:56 what the f
Y’all should’ve been here for the live premiere. The chat was flooded with USA chants. It was beautiful
7:57 All Star
9:18 LOL
If America went to Canada they would lose because the UK would get involved which would involve NATO and some other old British colonies
Can you make a video about the war of 1812
Can you make a video about the water of 1812
Who thinks the nordvpn guy looks like  young  dantdm
19:27 and 19:32  This is the loudest screen I've ever heard of oversimblified
5:54 I wheezed so hard😂😂
9:00 The best part.
Oversimplified is the goat
Man you are a legend 😂  what a terrific way of story telling 👍🙏😅
10:26 Person who got their face hit by a hammer: hey you’re mom is gay as heck Judge: SHUT UP
You need to do the Toledo War
10:23 From a polite but firm “Order!” to a violent “SHUT UP!” and a gavel throw.  Perfect. ✨
So many lands and disputes. White folks were so greedy.
These are gold!
Does anybody see the Russian flag between the American flags at 0:24
We should invade Canada. Heck I’m gonna run for president and that will be my #1 promise
we need any oversimplified mexican-american war video
that ending thi
3:57 I HEAR VOICES ALL THE TIME
p i g
The blue on the nord VPN  guy looks like it's his hair.
You teach me better than my social studies teacher (yeah she teaches me but it gets boring after a while)
22:34 Why would he do this? What could he possibly have to gain? Well... let me just answer that by saying I haven't completely worked out all of the bugs yet.
america never won a war against canada. canada has won a war against america  GET GUD
Can you do Philippines
I mean , in 1812 brits had something better to do than dealing with some Hyper active americans
Bro this is the funniest oversimplified video
Bro James Says The “D” World in 7:15
Damn the American really screwed over the british they took over point roberts they took the islands they took the fort they took most of the business away and what did the British get nothing and mean while the British deal would of made both of them happy.
Noooooo 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Pig and Potatoes Technoblade!!!
proud sheep snatcher❤️🇺🇸
FREEEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
we shot the pig and got the islands. 3-1 🇺🇸
0:09 well that's just gay man
Buchnan impression was so funny 🤣 😂
Do the white war
y'all can take vancouver island it's ok
9:41 The middle channel stated in the treaty
bro started a war
Man oversimplified rapped on 7:57 lmfao
Watch out Canadians !
I kinda dont know why the British didnt go to war with the USA when they were fighting Mexico.... in the case of building and mantaining empire, it was clear that the USA will won and then in the North America it would be only in the hands of British and stronger Americans. Thinking of the 1812 they had high chances even alone and since the industrial revolution came from England they were on the industial and technological advance i suppose.
Best ending to a video from this guy ever 😂
Nord Vpn is terrible in my experience
“I’ve got my spotted dick, my spice girls fan membership and an unrelenting negative outlook on life that affects everyone around me. Truly British!”  He knows too much.
9:40 i did just see from the start the these ”channels” almost started i saw that the island was cut in half so that’s the right ”channel” 9:40
No seriously... I lived in Washington State... SEATTLE my entire life and never learned a single thing about this wtf....
That last part always has me tweakin.
Ew biden ain’t gonna do shit
19:37 In case anyone was curious as I was, $100 in 1859 money is about $3,600 in today's 2023 market. The type of pig that was shot was about $200 *AT MOST* in 2023 currency.  Yeah, "outrageous" is a pretty good adjective to use here.
I'm from Vancouver Island and have never heard about this. This is hilarious.
Just go through the bathroom middle
let's invade canada they cant say sorry to all of us
i used to have a pet pig named kurtis he was killed by a bear that broke into my barn now if a man had killed my pig then told me about it that man would never be seen again
so interesting historic video , OverSimplified make it so well
Hot-headed buffoons...you could have just simply said Americans 😉
Awesome videos! Can you do one about the pacific islands please?
i cannot except that this was made 1 year ago.
GEELONG SC
Straight line? Straight line.
I feel kinda bad for pig
27:30 he actually did change the colours
If you're going to compare Americans to rats, or disease......and call us all racists....maybe....well.....nevermind, you're on YouTube already.....I hope you get some help man.
the ending was the most random thing ever with germany thats why I love history
13:28 😂😂😂😂
Because if we took Mexico and Canada and the entire world then that would be called the United States Empire and Global space Empire
Halloween song Single video about Canada
I can't unsee the nord vpn guy
7:57 Just stop. 🤣
canada eh
Thank you for helping with my Sam o’nella withdrawal
The amount of pathetic apologist rhetoric at the beginning is just🤮🤮🤮.  Mandated by God or whoever, Manifest Destiny was inevitable and good for America.
Still better than the Emu War. LOLOLOL 😄
3:37 I JUST REALISED IT SAYS DENSITY TO JOKE ABOUT AMERICANS BEING FAT
All Ohioien, get him
In all honesty america should just annex canada
Good job Canadians. Your endless comments have not only broken him, but encouraged millions of Americans that if we want your land ... It won't be hard to do it.
Best ending to a video ever
WAIT! OVER A PIG AND SOME POTATOES?! Technoblade reference?
I will not say you don't put Canada in your videos     WHY YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT BRAZIL 🇧🇷😭
31:04 is that Morgan Freeman?
Oh hello there
DESTINY MCFLY!!! just saw that!!!!
Make nordvpn character pin
37:50 God Bless America
17:31 *creaming*
The ending is hilarious
31:01 Morgan Freeman?!
As a Canadian, I for one welcome our destined American overlords. I am also very sorry.
Biden doesnt even know how to climb a set of stairs let alone invade Canada😂
Hey America. I’m from in Alberta. We have oil
This is probably your least realistic portrayal of us Brits
I don't like how you made us Brits look like the bad guys in that thumbnail
America lost war of 1812 was not a tie
I live In what I’m county and I can say with dignity america has to have the most one sided history EVER  It usually starts with a conflict and then america goes “FUCK YOU” and ends up getting what they want
I love how everyone up here in Canada is, like, "Yeah, we burned down the white house!"  Yeah. Back when we were the BRITISH.
21:23
16:33 American counter : 44 (yes, there are 2 that are offscreen cuz only one  shows his/her hand and the other is the head)
The ending was beautiful. God bless America🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
15:50 That's actually how the USA handles EVERY diplomatic conflict since their genocide of the natives
38:01
THEY KEEP COMING AND THEY DON'T STOP COMING HOPPED IN THEIR WAGONS AND THEY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING 🗣️‼️‼️
nice way to lose subs lefty pos
Do you remember Vimy Ridge by chance? Canada would crush the US if it ever came down to it.
7:58
Lol nice nothing but lefty propaganda on how bad whitey is. Lol like no other countries did it and it's not like we abolished it first
why do they fight over some islands💀
2023: A war because of Shooting of a balloon.
Yeah invade the Canadians, we're stronger
At 37:19, my patriotism leveled up… and I’m French.
NOOOOOO DOALINGEL IS FOWND ME HELLP ME  SORRY FOR BAD SPELLING 1:42
ONLY A PIG WAS KILLED WHAT ABOUT THE FEKIN POTATO
i agree with @KaptenLiong
7:59
Murica.
32:31 gives off the vibes off “ F you, F you, F you, your cool, F you and I’m out!” But with your an idiot and you actually have braincells
that ending tho
Poor Charles Griffen, he shall forever be remembered as a pig loving maniac
sheep
5:56 What the fu-
I noticed that when charles griffin asked Porky if he wanted to go to the island ball if yes roll in cow crap? how did cow crap get in the middle of a sheep farm?
this is a work of art
Where part 2 is????
37:17 that was the most United States IMPERIALIST moment of my life lol
There’s a dude that uploaded this video in its entirety with no changes whatsoever and it’s been up for a year wtf YouTube
Bro I can never get over these!🤣🤣
The Morgan freeman pig is so incredibly funny.
I freaking died when he said DRAKE!
Muricans historically being the problem
As much as I don't want to see America spread over Canada the voted Trudeau in twice, clearly they can't be trusted
If Brits landed on US they would get kicked their butt as during revolution war. And Canada should grow up and become a country of his own. Not under the crown. Same about Brits they should grow up and face modern world. Monarchy is outdated standard in modern world and ain’t welcomed anywhere. Everyone is citizen and everyone is equal no one is peasant or slave. And you have great people in your history who really did a lot for the world country and nation. So place their faces on your money not useless monarchy.
Stop worrying about Canada's kerves and start worrying about ur moms weight Benjamin
RAHHHH 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 🦅🦅🦅🦅
I love the jokes.
I just want to let everyone one know that even though it's been a year, us Canadians are still ready to take you on. Make sure to pack plenty of warm clothes you will need it!
The biggest threat ever is oversimplified shouting
Hudson's bay fucking *owned* Alberta???
anybody else seen the vietnam map?
man and we all thought social media started it
4:41
6:31 i just got rickrolled by oversimplified's own website...
What song is that at 7:25?
BTS mentioned 🥳🥳 💜💜💜💜
1:24 emotional damage!
The bit about invading Canada has aged wonderfully on god
Alright fellow Americans its our destiny to invade Canada, all in Faver say "I"
That ending was the greatest thing I have ever seen in my life
look at them eyes
Nothing beats the thumbnails on Oversimplified's videos
19:33 scream
Manifest Destiny = white supremacy by another name.
Biden would get lost on the way to canada
32:08
Bro, just delete entire FBI documents right there
Hilarious. The president hiding behind the curtains broke me
After watching EVERY other ruler, king, monarchy, and empire rulling and conquering in the way they did…. Seems so disingenuous to say American settlers were out of line seems ridiculous. It actually looks like par for the course of all of human history. Maybe people today should realize this. And today we’re still brutes, we watch as North Korea oppresses and orders their people and Africa,Venezuelan, and China and many more as well. And right here in America we have a genocide of the unborn….. mass human trafficking ……we’re not so much better today. 🤨🙄😢
pls do stalin simplifyed like you did with hitler
lol me to
7:57 HEY NOW UR AN ALL STAR-
7:25  I love this part so much-
the 38:00 is wtf..... :D
If you listen closely, at 7:57, he adds a bit of slightly changed All Star lyrics into his commentary
36:04 Teasing be like
It was great until the end. *shudders* I'm an American and I found that insanity scary. I know that he was making a joke, but there are way too many hot-headed eagle-worshippers out there for that sort of joke anymore. You can't give the radical reactionaries an excuse to grab guns for another cause. They won't get the joke... they'll take it seriously and then nice Canadian people will die.
Well the end rant would be interesting, nearly got pulled into a war because of potatoes being eaten and if that rant happened america would be pulled into a war because of a potato brain.
U
F
Even if I am Canadian I live nowhere near Canada and I have 2 accents
The US is like a big baby that always wants to get its way
General harney: puts pickett on the island   Winfield Scott: I will send you to Jesus
Bro spawned at the eitfel tower
U got a new subscriber!
The ending tho xD
Am still wondering till this day wtf was that ending??!....
yes 69 sheeps yas yes :D
I- my last is Harney, fucking kill me. I don’t wanna be related to that man he ugly
"Lyman shot the pig..." *Utter silence* *Tension rises*
Harney screams like a girl 33:29
RIP Technoblade Never Dies. 18:41
I feel somehow inspired by Harney's general chaotic attitude towards authority and order
“keep your potatoes out of my pig!” is gold
The pig war I didn’t know there was a war for your mom
Pepa pig dies 18:46
$100 is still a lot today.
How could Picket get along so well with his British counterpart? The whole reason Harley was sent away was because he put Picket back on the island, so wouldn’t Winfield Scot have reversed Harvey’s decision?
The writer was on something when he wrote that ending
War war
The McDonald’s is the most American thing other than guns
No one cant invade Canada we send all our braver and moose to the front line
34:40 bro st louis is not southern 🤨🤨🤨
I love how the pig is drawn almost exactly the same as gravity falls lol
7:57 a refreince
can you make irish history
I like how the video ended in the least patriotic american speech ever
In the middle of the to american flag at the beginning the looks like the Russian flag😂
We watch oversimplified at school cuz the teacher likes his videos
"I didn't say it was white people!" - The Americans and like every empire in the world
I honest to God can’t understand how someone with the privilege of being born in America can slander their own country this way. Certain ‘jokes’ are frivolous and ignorant.
It’s funny now though that over 90% of Canadians live on the American border, and anyone who obtains any fame or fortune born there, moves here. 😅
You yell things like genosamuel when he is emphasizing Chris chan’s all caps text posts
That Morgan freeman voice came out of absolutely nowhere lmao
Nice rap 7:57
The Waffle House has found it's new host
I can’t imagine what your neighbors are thinking after that ending
..."I thought it was Sharon's cat...I hear voices all the time!!!👻". Classic
If you weren’t born in Oregon, you shouldn’t be in Oregon.
There are not enough thumbs on the internet for this video
im not from usa
Let’s go out there and make the world a better place…..
10:30 average British politics
At this point we should take canada
The earth is flat
4:11 Welcome to America
Don’t talk about Mexico align your videos
My mom watched this with me, you’re now her favorite YouTuber
why does the pig look like waddles from gravity falls?
I feel like 32:45-33:36 sums up America very well. One guy that cares to do his job right, surrounded by a bunch of royal-grade stupidity that, despite not knowing what law is, somehow keeps managing to escape it. Seriously, the ratio of good hearts to entitled, ignorant arrogants is getting worse every day...
Remember that none of this would have happened if the British agreed to give up the south of Victoria
Bro love your videos. Clear, Acculturate and funny asf
This video was hilarious. I have been to the site and museum.. it's a fun story
You need to do a video on the Mexican American war
4:11 god bless America
General Winfield Scott is one of those historical figures who really gets a bad rep. Yeah, he was old and fat, but he was also one of the best commanders of his day (The Duke of Wellington called him the greatest living general) and he landed 10K men in Veracruz and captured Mexico City. Dude was a badass.
6:15 "even 6 of em" clearly shows 5 devices
Now I want an episode about the war with Mexico. Great content! :D
He somehow convinced me to invade canada as a canadian
21:28 Cpt. Pickett looks like Ian McCollum from forgotten Weapons
Moral of the story: idiots in charge, soldiers fighting wars. It's even applicable to other conflicts, like WWI.
Cuba and San Juan islands belong to America and USA should annexed Canada Mexico and all of South America
Buchanan made me laughing
I loved the smash mouth reference lol 😅
7:25 16:28
the intro was so good
Me when my parents aren't home 33:19
Ah Canada, Washington's mistake.
Straight line
6 yr old Canadian: "Canada will continue to be a sovereign nation into the future and I'll live past the age of 8, right?" 🇺🇸 *Dark Brandon* 🇺🇸: "Not so fast Jack"
I'm a direct descendant of Pickett's sister, and I've definitely been called a hot headed buffoon
Good luck taking my homeland you yank
This is comedy and educational at the same time.
Where is the veinam war ?I been waiting for 2 years
That Drake president ending definitely aged
I love you OverSimplified
Cant believed The pig Almost Started an Big war
Ye this was clearly made by an American. The war of 1812 was not a draw... if you fail to invade a country and get sent packing you LOST. Or have we forgotten  Afghanistan already ?
7:14 wow
why
11:45 - now I would like some lore of both Hawaii and Alaska.
7:57 fire rap song 🔥
The Papers Please hints are amazing
As a Canadian, I find the last part kinda concerning
37:14  Narrator gone wrong
18:40 My man just pumped his double barrel
Was Charles Griffin an ancestor of Peter Griffin ?
And this is not the only time in history when a war has started or almost started over a trivial matter... We really should have an minimum IQ requirement for leaders, if not tested high enough = No high ranking position for u to start a war by your dumb actions.
The ending got me f*caked up💀💀💀
15:45 who else saw what was on the wall
7:44 i love how he starts doing all star
Laughing of dying 32:40
Lyman, if you spare my life. I grant you 3 wishe- *dies*
No. So umm you see. Canada is gonna invade the USA and with help from the Brits and other powers uh we win. Also we just better lol 🇨🇦 🍁
This Canada not America if you want to invade, you will see history repeat its self just like in 1812, it dint end up to well 😉  I think stats are 1 Canada 0 USA, in true Camadian fashion, sorry.
30:52 Isnt this the same forrest from the Henry VIII episode?
nordvpn isnt worth it, no best korea feature.
Yeah, But I’m proud of being Canadian.  Canada is more safer this way, I don’t want America to be a Tyrant county.
14:36 had me dead! 🤣🤣🤣
0:49 Oh no! Its gonna be one of those episodes! OK bring it on.
The islands were for the British
Awesome and cool! :>
“The Waffle House has found its new host”
The waffle house has found it's new host
So... you are saying that the British, Spanish and the French are not white? OK! lol
7:06 old Tsar Alexander I
B2?
Its funny the world still thinks Canada doesnt have Nukes, Canada got Nukes from UK and USA during several conflicts and we never used them or gave them back, what, they took them apart? yeah right. you better hope US invades in summer loll.  But im guessing there is a lot more to this story thats not part of the official record.
Drake 2024
7:57 What I came for
Britain owns the Islands
I thought it was Shanon’s cat too
Like rats or disease 💀
Ngl this might be my favorite Oversimplified video
I think I have to be on the British side for this
33:22 Winfield Scott pulls a pro gamer move. 😂
9:19 😂he’s reading some risqué stuff there
"I'm sure this conflict won't cause anyont to- DIE!!" oh lords. I love all the dark humor and calling people out for the horribly dumb things they did! lel
Lol.
Invading Canada to jack up the price of their insulin, is the most American thing I'v ever heard of.
Splitting the islands in two would have been the most logical approach, the landmass in the eastern sphere of the island which would be assigned to the Americans is larger, giving them an incentive to accept the deal and reflecting the fact that there were more Americans in the region. The western landmass assigned to the British would reflect the fact the British controlled Vancouver Island and had overwhelming Naval Supremacy. Everyone could have then got on with their lives. Just an English point of view.  PS - Another hilarious video.
This ending is how the war broke out in South Park. Proceed with operation human shield!
Why were people so damn hated over a few tiny islands? I dont get why it was such a big deal to them. To be honest i didnt even know those islands were there prior to this video.
This is one of the best history videos on the site and you can’t change my mind.
I just want to comment about how you used a pump action's sound on a flintlock rifle.
Harney is the kind of guy who would dare to rob a gun store.
He even had Morgan Freeman voice the pig this genius.
18:40 Logan Paul in 2023
This video is a gem.The comedy,the ending,the everything is perfect. Love you oversimplified ❤️
God,I love this guy so much
That is the weirdest outro ever
Oversimplified: American blood pulsing.
37:09 peak comedy
I love the video
Heel turn
Okay but imagine going to a party based on you getting your ass kicked
Im canadian 😂
id like to see that mole George                 pls
thats pee pee poo poo of an idea abowt taking over canida.
Lol, of course an American who jokes about invading Canada says the War of 1812 was a draw. It was a defensive victory.
i wish you and your family all the best OverSimplified
NOOOOO, I don't want to become American
Yay he edited it!
The ending was perfection. god bless. annex canada
can we all agree that 36:59 is the best part in this video
USA roasts Canada btw
38:12         well that aged like milk
Get to the point that this person likes the sound of their own voice, even alought better than talking about the actual points of history!
bro uncool
Canada: NATO
Why the end... Why
Manifest destiny shall happen
moral of the story, solve every issue with a straight line.
You are special because God said you are. You are loved because God said you are. You matter because God said you do.
raid Canada!!!!!!!
Multiply like rabbits eh,? 🤣🤣  Lyman shot the pig.    Dear God had me rolling 🏃🤣
I like how there were reasonable ppl that thought it was idiot to start a major conflict over a pig and some small acres of land
*Brits:* These lands are ours! *US:* No, THESE LANDS ARE OURS! *Natives:* does it matter that we were here first? *US & Brits:* Not if we rewrite history.
This is hands down one of the weirdest war ever made in this world. xD No wonder God ha abandon us.
me at the end:  ***hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha*** !!!!!!!  Love the humor at the end. Tears all over my eyes.
Being a citizen of "Fartingdom", I can confirm that this is true @10:35   (I cant stop laughing)
Tbx
"I thought it was Sharon's cat..."
The part where the mafia pig came in the potato farm trying to eat the potato was gold He was so bold Such a sinister dude.
This is a comedy masterpiece while learninq history  10/10
37:48 - 37:53 yeah might want to remove that since what he did
The pig was my favorite character
When you do the Mexican-American war, could you please not encourage your viewers to invade us, thank you.
wow, oversimplified has got really extreme in the last couple years
Interesting ending. Can you cover the war of 1812?
Just coming back to be reminded of the greatest ending to a video ever
36:56
37:25 I’m scared
Dude, uncool
Florida is a dick!
It’s my fault, just at the end of this right where you went for Thomas at the end of this right
5:52 each new video with a Nord VPN sponsorship the people get more and more surprised about the nord character. Kinda cool
OverSimplified, your lebensraum is showing.😂
please dont invade canada :)
Never underestimate the love a man have for the pork 😆
You should do fictitious wars series
invade Canada so we will be most powerful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love the British taking the flag pole with them. It’s stuff like that that keeps life interesting. Oh hey guys we accept that Germany chose you over us but I’m well now you can’t raise your flag. So hahahahahahah! Love from the USA to Britain and Canada
You don’t know what day, week, or month he is posting. Yet, every time he does post, your day is automatically great.
WE WILL TAKE OVER THAT DANM CANADA
This is awsome. keep it up oversimplifed
If we tried to invade Canada that's a maybe we would get invaded by other countries or at least get attacked by them
I think we should invade Canada
wait why was the god damn idiot who invaded mexico randomely still in the military ? should he not have gotten shot day one? and how did he rise up the ranks ??
Yeah Canaians, be SCARED beause we're coming!
Omg that ending lmao
USA USA USA
Loved the ending about Canadians
The b-2's
It's 2023, where's the invasion at? Come on OverSimplified... you- you promised... 😥
The middle channel
That was the best ending yet in any of the videos on this channel, and I have watched them all
5:56 what the fu-
I'm firmly convinced that the Pig and Emu Wars were named after pigs and emus mainly because the humans involved were too embarrassed to be mentioned.
Victoria 3 have Canada owning lots more than this lol
Dang I spoiled the ending for myself by looking at a map.
27:29 It does actually change.
16:29
3:34 damn, our country is hung like a race horse.
This has to be the most accurate depiction of Americans I’ve seen ever. Yeeeehaaaaaah! *BANG BANG BOOM* McDonald’s!
The pig is the senate because it’s palpatine based on the thumbnail
The end was just as good if not better than the whole video. 🤣
Yeahhhhh your not taking canada
I am in canada
Quality ending 🤣😂
history fun
6:20 , how you know I like BTS? 🤣
sure send biden. he'll die before he eats his first ice cream cone here
This certifies why technoblade loves history and america
History is important to remember and at times fun to learn if some humor is tossed in. Terrific job OS!
I live in Canada
The Drake part aged... well... how to say this shit, oh yea he passed college.
Hey oversimplified just suggesting a video idea, maybe u guys could make oversimplified versioms of greek mythology? I think thatd be interesting to see😊
All of this is because of an island and a pig, Welcome to America.
If America had been at war with the Brits, the Civil War would have gone WAY differently. Thank goodness for General What's-his-face.
17:00
So Americans what did you think of this video? Especially the start?
The moose would kick your yankee asses out before we had a chance to release the syrup cannons.
19:36
Straight line?
Who was in paris?  The founding fathers that who
wtf was that ending 😭
Lyman if you spare my life I will grant you thre (gets shot)
he's really at the end just complementing Canada with best American food and national park
Russian flag
I have actually been on the islands many many times their very pretty.
How would General Harney's letter have gone through the Panama canal when it wouldn't be finished til the first World war?
i lived on San Juan and learned about the pig war growing up. Kind of surreal to see Oversimplified make a video about it. Had some info I hadn't heard before. super cool !!!
This video should be homework for kids to watch!👌🏻
imagine if the end actually happened i would say murica would win but we all know liz pulls out the totems of undying when charles is sad in a corner when its captured and she pulls out uno reverse and shows that britain is older and sets the foundation to the world not the new generation and then biden would fall of the bike get brain hemorrhage and die and australia 2.0 is born the new president of america is the person with the record of eating the most big macs
Wow I am surprised to find out the British was trying to help the Confederate army although they abolished slavery almost 30 years before. Just goes to show british Emancipation was not about humanitarian reasons but mainly economic.
21:21 What's the song that plays when Harney goes into scheme mode?
I want more winfield scott!
Father vs son war this crumbs about to get Interesting cuz itz my first time watching this
Do Vlad the Impaler (Dracula )next pls.
That ending was awesome
He forgot to mention that Harney was freaking promoted to brigadier general after he nearly launched the country into its third was with Great Britain
My dream is like:Wana go to France??Then you neeeeeeedddd.....NORTH VPN!!!
At 27:28 and 27:29 I can't see the change is the Canadian border or the US border.
18:44 he just sounds so serious though
What song is played at 7:25 and 16:27 ?
Thats right Canadians we're coming
american channeleels
This video is an ad. Stay away!
Biden is coming with his diapers and knee pads for when he goes up the stairs
“But the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming,  hoped in there wagons and they hit the ground running”-Oversimplified
🇨🇦
general Harney went into scheme mode Dunadunaduna duna duna
I don’t even think the British guy would have a toothbrush to use
10:57
The thumbnail is brilliant because its the star wars chapter 3 poster.
Мудреныч лучше
i love the mcdonalds
ORDER!! ORDER!!!, SHUT UP!!!!
11:56 noice  22:17 Ah yes, sending a letter through the Panama Canal 80 years before it’s built
6:18
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
and just like that, canada becomes america
You should use NordVPN NOW!!!!!!!!!
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7:26😂
That Morgan Freeman pig got me! 🤣
There was a war called the pig war between Serbia and Austo-Hungary from 1909 to 1911. It wasnt an actual war but an economic war in which Austia blocked Serbias live pig trade to the rest of Europe. In the end Serbia won by building factories for meat processing.
I died inside every time he said 'Berkshire'
I can't believe I got a Hudson's Bay ad while watching this video.  Still going strong after 200 years.
Locally Canada and the US are best friends right right
Something in the way Captain Hunt jumps back when Harney gets hit with that chair really appeals to me, and I don't know why...
Idc what people say that island was british
Why does every American in this vid have a FRIKIN GUN
Your so cool
The British and Americans bickering over an island reminds me of the whisky war witch was a dispute between Canada and Denmark over Hans island witch similar to the pig war was conceanintly placed in the middle of their borders from 1978 to 2022 and ended when the two nations decided to split the island between them and this took place during russias invasion of Ukrain and was to show that any dispute can be solved peacefully. You should make a video about that in the future
10:10
When that one cousin always takes your things and you finally had enough 33:29
What’s the music 23:09 ?
Does spuddy have sonic shoes?
19:03 Bro think he Walter White
Im totaly british ANS THE ISLAND IS OURS lol
darth pigious
"We have the manpower, we have the arms..."  Yea that's what Russia thought BEFORE they invaded Ukraine.
OverSimplified realizing that usa can't attack canada couse of nato : f**k
The funny parts arent funny, speed this shizz up
Do a detailed video of War of 1812
As a proud Canadian, that ending was the funniest thing I have ever seen, and I’ve seen Who’s On First.
I'm gonna get some therapy, you will be hearing from my therapist soon (I love these videos)
I can’t believe this was made a year ago
18:44 when that happened I went "AGHHH"
I love this guy he makes learning historic figures and wars much more fun than my social studies teacher
By far the funniest OverSimplified video.
8:59
One hockey game loss. I can ruin your dream with one defeat on Hockey
I Like World War II And The Korean War
"I'd worry less about Canada's curves, and more about your own curves, Benjamin." 😂
Berkshire is said barkshire
You should do the American Mexican war
5:56
When oversimplified uploads 36:02
ain't no way 7:57 xD - Very creative
*there are no white people there  Whole video consists of white people fighting over their land
The Brits have no right to complain about colonialism and expansionism. Christ they took a 100 times more than what my countrymen took.
38:10 the appearance of darth Brandon lmao
British in there island  (acting normal ) Meanwhile Americans sailing to  a island  "THIS IS AARE AIIILAND"
33:28
What the fuck America?!
The “woah woah woah , who said they were white?”😂😂😂😂
37:13 I'm Scared...
Video Is 1 Year Ago I Think. 7:32 9:20 16:36 17:31 [Now Is 3 Years Ago]
The pig wars (mini wars #5)
This is violent and I like it
good vid
there is no middle of the islands
I like that oversimplified makes history fun
imagine how the US would look if they did go to war. itd be confederate people still picking that cotton.
Wtf at 9:41
Props to general scott for figuring out a way from this clusterfuck.
Ngl the final part Is pretty epic
This feels like an episode from a sitcom, but it actually happened. This is the single most funniest and dumbest moment in history
Wish he would do a roblox video for kids who sneak online
I dont agree with a couple of the jokes but it's all funny as heck! Subbed and liked!
cool
My fav one keep up with the good work m8
"Scheme Mode" @ 21:22 plays a piano version of the Predator film's theme song. 🤣
That start was outa pocket
"American keep coming and don't stop coming. They load up into their wagons and hit the ground running" 🤣
That Berkshire pig reminded me of waddles
We will rise again and defeat the american swine who dared kill our swine!
the end got me screaming 💀
(10:54)Wondering how accurate Oversimplified’s portrayal of the U.K. Parliament is. Probably more accurate than we think.
actual representation of the british parliament
Obviously the American general is going to be fat
6.99 million subs
23:09 what is the song?
"ChatGPT, make a story about Trump in the style of oversimplified"
3:34 anyone else think florida was america's d_ck in this scene
1812 wasn't a draw. It was a clear Canadian victory. The US lost all its gains, and had its capital burned down.
36:54 but what about the potatos?
I didn't say your white people that's dark
This would make the best historical comedy ever
Oh I would love to see the history of Ukraine in such style
33:32 I just realized he pulls off his belt to beat him with it
HEY BUDDY WE BOTH HAVE WAR PLANS OF TAKING EACHOTHER THINK ABOUT THAT EH.
When Pickett is sent back to the island it is so funny
How is this video is not taken down by the US invading canada part of video
imagine that ending sparks the invasion of canada (it really wouldnt be a bad idea to fuse the US and canada and with that rules so like US governmental laws and such but economic stuff such as health care is canadian also canada can get rid of their president that committed black face like 4 times and is also just kinda a douche)
How did he get Morgan freeman
Well. It was our island the whole time.
Tbh I think this should’ve been a mini-war
The ending bit literally made me do a spit take.
pizza
The pig war made me pee my pants
😂😂😂 drake
Ohh say can you see,by the dawn’s early light oh so proudly hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming
😂😂😂😂
Real Angry Birds war
"the causilties of pig war is a pig" *"spuddy cries in the corner"*
I love your videos 😂 thank you!
It’s Our DESTIINNNYYY
Bloody,more like bloody banner of France And was that true that it was The PIIIG WAAAAR?
I’m Canadian!
The propaganda at the end.
Love how many "being american" lines there are.
I didn't know this story and it was interesting. thanks!
You guys will still end up destroying maple syrup
Do 1971 Indo-Pakistan war video oversimplified please
the pig was technoblade
nice rap 7:57 its a song called all star if ya dont know it u dont have shrek
5:53 THAT "what the f-" GOT ME 😂🤣
33:17  Harney: I agree not to put Pickett back on the island. Peace will be maintained.  *5 minutes later*  Fuck this peace treaty, fuck Britain, Pickett, get back on the island.
How is it a draw when you fail to invade Canada and the White House gets burned down?
The end bit almost had me pissing my pants
how aboat you do a video of the the ukraine war some time
the end was so funny i just have to laugh
That walking animation feels out of place
The slow transition from rationality to anger and overall insanity at the end is beautiful. I've watched it 40 times and I have wept every one of them. God bless America for we must manifest our destiny. o7
Where is the canada video you traitor?
bruh its already been 1 year since this video? damn time flies
Happy one year of birth day
dude pleaseeee make the TURKİSH İNDEPENDENCE WAR that would be good
the ending was best ending any Oversimplified video ever had
BIDEN’S INVADING CANADA AND MEXICO IN 2023 LETS GOOOOOoOooOooOoOo
Happy one year anniversary of this video 🙏🏾
Has anyone noticed that oversimplified is less and less simplified? Since the beginning of this channel, where the ww1 could be shrunk to 15 minutes which was truly oversimplified, we now have a 40 minute video about a banal conflict over a pig :D. Love it.
6.97m subs
Anyway hi SPQR
I accidentally watched this video on its 1 year anniversary
4:10
Oh wait after almost a year I just realized that the "things" at the sheeps face isn't a smile but a nose
Where's Canada?
What's annoying me for no reason is that Lyman clearly has a break action shotgun but it's used as a pump action  Idk why this is annoying me so much
WHAT THE F.
Thank god Canada did not merge with the US! Yes I am Canadian. Hahaha, west US is the east fat ass!!
in the "our love is natural." With spuddy, was a pun intended?
Canada needs some Freedom
War over pigs and potatoes. A delicious war indees
I didn’t say they were white people
You think they really cared about the Indians skin color? It was a time of expansion and had they found a lost colony of Vikings,  we still would have expanded over them.
hey i'm canadian
the alternate story is they were racist..
This one was out of the park at the end. Joe Biden is coming. His son is too. Hookers and Crack shall flow on the streets of Montreal!
The Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running, oversimplified is just rapping
Bro why? I'm a Canadian wtf bro
Lol muricans really are that stupid
Fear not my Canadian friends, the only things that Joe Biden ‘comes’ on is young children. Rest assured, the only nation he threatens is his own.
(Warning this is probably, must likely, a inappropriate joke thats not funny)  U.S: **Eats Burger**  **Proceeds To Grow A Fenis**    (I will not explain)
Um hello I’m canadian
32:29 Winfield Scott: *reading off ppl as idiots* Generals: *nervous sweating* Winfield Scott: You guys are fine Generals: :D
I never understood why Americans spread so far west when they barely populated the stuff eastwarf
25:08 my dad making me do an impossible task
The Winfield Scott psychopath breakdown killed me 😂
AND IT BURNED BURNED BURNED  AND WE'RE THE ONES THAT DID IT AND IT BURNED BURNED BURNED AND THE AMERICANS RAN AND CRIED AND IT BURNED BURNED BURNED AND IT WAS ALL VERY HISTORICAL
That rant at the end 😂😂😂😂 Imagine living next door to listening to that 😂
33:29
i was in the finals of a state quiz AND A QUESTION ABOUT THE PIG WAR CAME AS THE LAST ONE IN THE FINALS AND I WENT CRAZY AND EVEN SAID THANK YOU OVERSIMPLIFIED WHEN I ANSWERED I LOVE YOU
who else whats him on your free time?
benjemin franklin,personally i would not take that level of disrespect
Good god these never get old
I doubt the Americans could take Canada unless they nukes it but that could also go very badly for them
As a Canadian I wish we were part of USA.
did your voice get deeper? like you grew up or something? lol
7:56😂😂
I live near chimney rock in Nebraska and I feel so honored that he actually drew it correctly even though never named. Nebraskans always think it's a big deal when we are on TV 😂😂
What the f**k
Canda is apart of NATO making it a crime to invade and America would be seen as a traitor, so invade Mexico instead.
for those that dont know he mispelled destiny with density in 3:38
I just realized why he put the U.S legs so far forward. Florida... look at Florida
Bro... Just let mexico have the island
sir i got a report its important! what is it? there a world war! WHAT?HOW someone shot a pig
Those pigs look so much like Waddles from Gravity Falls I love it
7:00 Oregon out here reppin’ those Chris Chan colors.
32:27
Oversimplified is the best it is funny even now it is goofy I just can’t get mad at him🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love you 🥰🥰😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Well... they did it in da Fallout world-universe-somethang.
37:12 No.... don't give people ideas...
Boy this got very patriotic at the end……
Hey over simplified I love your work and I wanted to say that I’m related to President Buchanan he was one of my very distant cousins
I don't know if I'm the only one named Hudson here but every time i stop focusing on the vide oversimplified would "Hudson's Bay company" and i would immediately focus back on the video lol
29:18
Shoutout to General Winfield Scott stopping Harney from his stupidity
not much is known about the reason why, some thing there was no sceme just mind boogling stupidity,  i hve met many people and the think i learned is NEVER underestamate stupidity
14:36 gets me everytime 😂
Gdsg😊
what ever you do DO NOT SHOW THE END OF THIS VIDEO TO JOE BIDEN
What did biden do....
14:37, my last two brain cells working together to try and make a understandable sentence
nice to know americans have always been like this, I guess
That Canada biit at the end had me laughing SO hard. 😂 We'd win and Canada would apologize for fighting us.
This should be a Netflix show or something.
Great video on the Pig War, but what on Earth did you take before announcing your attack on Canada idea????  Better Canada takes over the mess you created is USofA,....
"It was Billy right?" "I thought it was  Sheramy's cat" "I hear voices all the time" I think some of the best oversimplified bits are when people are whispering to each other
Love the representation of the pioneers.🤣
Why does he pronounce rather as rahther
33:26
Canadians burned down the white house. Most of the British forces who fought in the War of 1812 were Canadians colonists, former American Revolution troops who fought for their freedom on the side of the British, and so on. But the fact remains. You can use any technicality you want, but America, couldn't take Canada by force, end of story. You call it a draw? No, it wasn't a draw, if it were a draw, the Americans would have had more say in the negotiations. But instead, they basically had to do everything the Canadians wanted, including, but not limited to, paying to build Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The losing side had to pay out in order to avoid a full scale invasion as a response to their attempted annexation of Canada. Of course you call it 'The Pig War'. Americans never cease to amaze me with their undeserved arrogance.
I’m only patriotic when the British r around
NES controller at 5:07. Also the map in the lower right corner is showing SE Asia for some reason?
Captain Pickett is the 1800s Ian McCollum!
That bird flock animation was really good
37:07 for those looking for the end part lol
This video is my favorite of all of them
The pigs look like the ones in gravity falls
Imagine if this starts the war,also president Drake got me 💀
“I’d worry about your own curves Benjamin” greatest comeback
This is offensive because I live in Canada but it’s funny
At 11:57 you can see the exact frame the pig spawns
as a canadien i feel so scared now
bro You forgot canada
bro you are like the best on history
U don’t talk about Canada that much
ORDER ORDER
Интересный факт: 0:25 между двумя флагами США, можно увидеть флаг России :)
This is my favorite ending on a YouTube video ever
This channel is my favorite for AP US history :)
I like gold and the gold mine is Canada's that I like and Britain won the war of 1812.
you never talk about canada
where's canada
shush child
Why couldn't they just split the islands tho did they even think back then
But if Canada and US entered a war together half of the world would be with Canada like Russia and china so I think Joe will lose the war
Liberate canada.
33:25 was the best scene I ever saw and FUNNY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cool video🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤖🤖🤖🤖🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
At 35:10 look at germany 😆
He might be on to something with the Canada thing 🤔.
Over Simplified : Canada, BACK OFF Canada : Why Not?
why do you always do sponsors😕
Flordia 💀
Why does the narrator pronounce the word "rather"  Roth-er?
bro nice rap at 7:57
0:23 6:53
Can you pls do the war of  100 years?
First          I mean last
Not drake he's racist and antisemitic
That Smash Mouth reference.  ❤
6:24 i will now get nordvpn so i can watch 7 duds hip thrusts
Me at the outro: ok. When he start to talk about maple syrup: YOU BETTER NEVER SAID THAT AGAIN!!!
4:00 someone in the background said “i HeAr VoIcEs AlL tHe TiMe!”
Ending yes
This was brilliant! 👍🇬🇧
27:29.. theere is no difference.
OverSimplified is the king of the smoothest transitions into sponsors
3:31 hehe guys look at Florida see I’m so funny
Canada in NATO: *laughs in maple syrup*
It should be a song 7:58
Don’t stop taking your meds😂
37:14 is by far my favorite part of this video. heck, its the favorite in all of his channel!
San Juan Island National Historical Park is to this day under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category V protected landscape, made up of the sites of the British and U.S. Army camps during the Pig War. So this is serious, not a laughing matter!
s
When Pickette first showed up I was thinking "No, can't be the same..." but then over ten minutes later was "Oh crap, it is."  And then I was thinking "Okay, so what would have happened if Pickette *WAS* blown to bits by the Brits, how would have things turned out at Gettysburg?"
Ain’t a hater but I  gotta say, IMAGINE VOTING BIDEN AND MAKING THIS WOLD A WORSE PLACE
Why are the Americans driving a Mazda?
Mounties would look far better in RWB
21:25 Underrated Joke
37:47 Eww
"These other guys are gonna steal this land I stole! The nerve!"
I'm from the pac/northwest and it's great to finally understand this. I spent my summers in the San Juan Islands and ran into alot of allusions. Also live in the town Pickett retired to after the Civil War. His house is a museum but only recently was his bridge de-named for being a confederate general.
Oversimplified. Great title that explains these videos are simping history for the simple and getting over on them. This is why the last two generations are filled with woke garbage. They watch this and and actually believe the context…
Someone needs to turn this into a satire movie! 🎥 Please😂😂😂
I'm at the 20th minute of the video and this is the lowest stake of all the low stake wars. By this time, Napoleon had conquered Europe twice. Not that I'm complaining, I love the video, I love the Smash Mouth reference, carry on creating quality content Oversimplified!
37:18 Foreign intervention Nato NOT BEING A DICK just to name a few
Griffin demanding $100 in damages is a de facto admission that the injury took place in the US. Case closed.
A Canada-USA mass country sounds more beneficial
7:31 16:35
7:57 SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME
DO NOT INVADE CANADA
IM NOT LETTING YOU LAND THOSE TROOPS ON MY COUNTRY'S PROPERTY
jokes on u we dont sleep
so your tellling me the yankees won? canada had to give land to dirty corrupt yanks, thats bs.
33:29 is the funniest part i've seen in Oversimplified
That fucking militaristic irrational ending.... dude... uncool.
Ummm why is there the Russian flag at the be bigining in the middle of the USA flags
I took Washington state history and they never even taught us about these events lol
the pig death and war
Subtle Smash Mouth reference. Lol
This is why the UK hates America
The first three minutes of this episode says it all...fast forward to the present, same ole shyt different era...!!!🙏🤔
Were taxing you for your entire farm 1000+ animals, land, and a home.  81$  You killed my pig?   You owe me 100$ 🤔🖕   No, 35-60$ is reasonable ish   But high. 100$????   So the tax should have been 1000$ you have 10 100$ pigs and 1000 35-150$ sheep
Did you know that the war of 1812 the part of it that happened in Canada happened in Emmetsburg it's actually right near a little French town called LaSalle so if you know where that is then you know where that happened it's also right near Detroit we all know what Detroit is I know that because well when I used to live in Canada also because I paid attention in history class
Nord VPN will be the one and only sponsor of oversimplified due to the Hitler video
Person in crowd “I hear voices all the time”
Why does this sound like maple in her pet pig from gravity fall
The mobility scooters 😂
why is the montage of the pig and griffin after the pig died the saddest thing ive seen in months
nordvpn is practically a character of this channel at this point😂
honestly with what the canadians are going through wiith their government i bet they would welcome the americans with open arms. lol
Straight line?
what's the song that plays during the pig romantic montage?
This is secretly just a channel to sponsor NordVPN.
So America is a terrible ruthless place for conquering people and expanding their nations strength, but other countries in history were just doing what was normal for the time? Got it...
I don’t really like the tone of this video, acting like Americans were terrible ruthless people because they wanted to expand their nation...thats literally every nation in history that did the exact same thing. America is only hated on because they were the most successful at it.
Biden suckssssssssssssssssssssssss but i loveeee you're videossssssssss
OverSimplified, it really makes sense that the US claimed the San Juan islands, why?, well, when us claimed part of the oregon county, it met unitil the Strait of Georgia, and thats IN THE LEFT SIDE, of the San juan islands
I disagree with it being a draw
wivh animation u use
Average Minecraft SMP conflict
Jake
Yet another war that could have been stopped with better fences.
It would take a lot of money to support Canada if we took it. Canada however will become more lucrative in the future as Global Warming takes over and the temperatures in Canada become very favorable. Not to mention the passage in the North Pole that's going to be contested. Nobody talks about it yet, but trust me if I know Americans, the moment a financial opportunity pops up, they are going to contest it arguing Alaska is there so they control the North Pole.
If you combined Picket and Harney you would get Kernel Sanders…
if he can remember which way is south or north maybe bidens coming lol
Out of all the vids you choose in the vpn sponsor you choose Hitler 😭
Yattaaaaaa!!
With this channel I’m learning more history than in school
34:10 I thought this was an extremely niche history joke about how Southern Arisocracy viewed themselves as being the descendants of the Cavaliers, who were the enemies of the Roundheads in the English Civil War, but then I realized it's just a joke about how Pickett's head isn't a circle.
The only thing Biden is coming for is our kids, and maybe some ice cream.
The part where General Scott waited by the door and then burst in to beat some asses made me almost piss myself.
"That be how it will, is it? Will it be how that is, huh?
Oh my god, the references in this are *on point!*
12:16  Wait, how did cows get onto the island?
Loved the All Star lyrics reference at 7:57
Is this for middle schoolers?
congrats on 6.9 million subs
Z🌦😃
12:41 does that 'customs collector' have a name though?
I feel like this dude going a little bit too far…
Best advertising segue ever
Not "The Pig War" it was The Great Pig War!"
you have the war of emus, pigs, and buckets but not the vietnam war?
I mean México and France went to war for cakes I think a pig is fair enough 😅
My dad's from Orcas Island (the big one at the top that looks sorta like an agogô) and so I learned this story when I was a little kid and spent most of my life swearing that there was a war between America and Britain/Canada over a pig and getting the "suuuuuuuuure that totally definitely happened, a war over a trespassing pig...please take no notice as I call the asylum" treatment
Oh goody, another America's bad video. 🙄
Sorry i know it's terrible but i laughed too loud at the "i didnt say its white ppl" joke
16:04 the AK47 isnt Murican
I live in victoria, its actually the capital of british columbia, and the border is the weirdest shape ever lol
How did Pickett make it this far in his career was he just the only one that survived
Not to brag but I was, like, the 69 millionth subscriber to your channel.
7:26 ah yes The National Emblem piece. Best piece to describe America.
Somebody needs to make a drama tv show out of this
Some pigs, a thousand sheep, some Hawaiian shepards and an Irishman on the island. Where the hell did the Cow crap come from?
I died when it said, "MY DENSITY!" 3:32
I love how the pig looked a little like waddles
if a simplified view of history lasts close to 40 minutes, its not simplified enough.
Point Roberts was not in this dispute?
ogni tanto in questa nazione abbimo bisogno di ammucchiarci intorno a un soggetto accessibile che ci strilla che se ne frega
President Drake 💀💀
And so San Juan island lost universal healthcare.
The islands should belong to Canada
Best History Teller
wow you really hate America so hilarious
that ending was kinda disrespectful I think
We Canadians beat you in 1812, we can do it again.
7:37 is my favorite part
As a  canadian, that is hillariously offensive
It feels wierd that a character has a walk cycle in an oversimplified video
Gezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm gonna laugh when Russia nukes America and then Canada takes over.  +1 OverSimplified
4 ads in 10 minutes of video ???
in 5:34 I love how the birtish house has cups of tea and the american house has a gun
I just love this guy's humor
As a resident of Lake of the Woods, can confirm it is not oval.
You got me at "U-S-eh?"
I traveled the oregan trail once, it was a great game
I love oversimplified best historical videos 😀😀
Please do Vietnam war
3:43 I like to think this is how western expansion actually happened.
Canadians in the Northwest territories canada: Try us USA *Uses finnish winter war techniques* USA: The snow is speaking Canadian Run!
Yes we will have Canada for the greatest country in the world
Will it be a lot smarter to kidnap the pig and use him as brides instead of shooting it
Biden or Trudeau... The States can take both of them, and we can have our own land, that isn't American.   We'll call in our dear friends in France about that manifest destiny... That is pittance next to... The Glory of France! God's chosen nation!   That will spill the blood of all who oppose them!
Woah woah woah… I didn’t say they were WHITE people… that got me.
Americans threatening to invade Canada:  MANIFEST DESTINY!!!! Russians invading Ukraine : MANIFEST DESTINY!!!! Americans: Surprised pikachu face
10:30 as a brit I can confirm that this is 100% what British politics is like
President Harney, a true American
I was wondering if this was the same PIckett whose charge basically lost Gettysburg for the South.
One thing that made me laugh was 3:50 It’s freaking said I hear voices all the time
DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU DUMB POLITICIANS-- THE MIDDLE (pls dont drop nuke on mi home im sorwy) Edit: (16:02) And this is why I am British....... great minds think alike?
You kill a pig, you kill a pig obviously
That would be so great if we attacked Canada It would probably only take about 3 weeks to whoop their ass  It would open and the price of gas would come down 58 cents a gallon you know we get to keep the women too that'd be great
10:23 through10:28 very funny😂😂😂
omg!1!1!1!1 i got mcdonald happy meal!11!1!1!1!
look what capitalism does to your brain
calm down and have some maple syrup on your bacon, eh?
the 69th one
All the other videos are matter of fact but when it comes to this, the bias is fleeting.
Hey oversimplified you probably won’t see this but I’m doing a history project on the pig war and this video is the reason why if you could somehow tell me some sources I would be so happy. Thank you
35:03 some Irish went to America to fight for the union during the Civil War
america: being greedy self-entitled dickheads for over a century
Every summer I go to Orcas Island (the island shaped like a horseshoe and biggest island) and it is a really cool place! I recommend visiting San Juan County and using the public fairy system to go to the 4 main islands! (San Juan Island, Orcas Island, Lopez Island, and Shaw Island).
British would be controlling America sadly
General Harney is my kind of man
dark brandon invades canada real
You know that Japan beat Russia in the past so it is possible for Canada tub beat United States plus they alliances
7:57 reference to All Star by smash mouth is dope
I killed your pig Killed your pig  killed your pig  That shit got me 😂
😂 "But I like to think they did 😘"
Mans turning history into a joke
SUS 0:10
yee haww diplomacy
Benjamin Franklin is the reason Isle Royale national park exists.
Spuddy's got Sonic shoes
The Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming pop in their wagons and hit the ground running didn't make sense to keep sharing oregon
The poem
JoJo reference at 21:27??
30:20 haha the solders all most dropped the basket
29:14 Buchanan! Ahah😂
Ill never be able to sleep because of that end part, thanks.
Oversimplified:dates his video with a joke Me:I wouldn’t do that todayB)
Who was in paris?
Was this written by King George?  Like I get how it's eDgY and current to hate the United States as though they invented racism but damn bro.
Bro canada is ours uk
"After the war, it was..."  AD: A cracked windshield? Buy now!
Now i hope he does a video on Vietnam to see some scared muricans
Further proof that taxation has always been bullshit.
charles griffin 💀💀💀
less jokes
Choo
Germany: "Ight we're gonna give these islands to the USA because we hate Britain."  Britain in World War I: "it's payback time, bastardio."
The last 2 minutes of this video haunt my dreams sometimes....
how is this not in the mini war playlist???
I thought you were going to rhyme all that parody of All-Star.😂
Absolute mad lad
What the fuck was that ending my dude
The customs agents had been given authority by the American colonies, and the British This was a ploy to start a war, the British had Charles set up the farm without the American agents knowledge and had no intention to let the agents tax Charles
This is my favourite video😂
Canada: y did u invade me? US: the oversimplified video.
Legend
it was a great video up into the point you put Biden in it cuz nobody f****** likes biting and I'm not going to accept that he's our president cuz if that's the case then we all must accept he's a terrible president and absolute utter mistake
Good Video.
bro you cant just leak american strategies like this operation: maple burger is still classified
The fact they were not white people what are they?
This is a great video, however, there is a flaw. You see, the Pig War took place in 1859. At time 22:17, you display the letter going through the Panama Canal, which began construction in 1904.
3:38 I just realised
0:22
How many other Americans agree that when you hear to do something, you have an urge to do the exact opposite?
37:18-38:42 no America can't invade Canada because those too nation's have some of the strongest alliances in the world. And the two nations are in NATO.
"being American he pulled out a gun on him" "being American he ran out with 4 pistols and a knife on them" "being Americans they pointed guns at him" 😈😈yrldy know
Biden slowed oil down to a trickle, I'm currently learning to speak Chinese
Now, the war of cakes
That ending XD
7:58 "But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. It didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon, when they outnumbered the brits more than six to one." Did no one else see what he did there? Hint* "somebody once told me"
I always wondered about hornby island’s name came from. Watching on hornby ironically enough. Great video.
Damn it, I thought there were ACTUALLY going to be pigs fighting each other and throwing mud at the enemy lines!!!!!  I'm disappointed that I didn't see a pig carrying a rifle and firing it.
What's weirder?  A man and his pig (animal) or a man and his potato (crop)
We are open to your invasion
Arnold’s grandpa talked about this
Whiteez..man!..you're a mess hahaha! It all belongs to Maori hehe!
"Steamy McSteamface" deserves a sensible chuckle 😁
I just realised why this is oversimplified – so the Americans can understand it. Another video once again proving the British liberate and provide freedom to former colonised lands
The best
Fun fact: what they told germany was essentially: see, almost all residents are american. And it's a tiny island in the middle of nowhere so moving would be super annoying for that little village full of poor farmers. Then the British came with standard empire talk and the germans at that time kind of wanted colonies, too.  So the americans got the island.
dislike for you not finishing the entire lyrics of allstar
The sheep argument had me in stitches
Why he have ak47 I have to be m16
CANADIAN BACON BITCH
Be honest, how many times did you hit repeat to look for the difference at 27:26
i love oversimpledfied
3:40 Youre pretty much a dick.  Made it to 4 mins in.  Realized you're a CRT soy boy... End of watching.
Bro Biden would just forget where Canada is. On top of that when was the last time the US even won a war, scooters and airtanks won't do so well in the winters here bud.
Its funny how this cute little video is littered with little woke jabs at history... someone's feelings must've been hurt really bad to make this video.
You've gone insane
The finale tho 😅
You don't have to worry everyone no non-white people were portrayed in a negative light during this video, another great job by OverSimplified of color-washing history.
5:50 only in the oversimplified universe can the wind blow two different directions at the same time
sponsor over at 6:52
7:56 - 8:04 is my favorite part
Well I thought this was the war pigs  story.  Nope different story.  I was after the flaming pigs 🐖 🐖 🔥🧯
Who ever reading this God bless you saying to who believe
I was rewatching all the videos, and I noticed how smooth the animation is! And the voice acting is amazing!!
33:29 got me chortling
4:08 7:26 14:02 15:06 15:53  16:00can't think of a better way to explain America
me unsubscrbing after watching the video
I think he should do the wars with hannibal tbh
3:32 Florida...
The americans on mobility scooters in the 19th century is a great gag.
When he talks about the War of 1812, Britain BURNT DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE and repelled all attacks into Canada, yet it is called a draw. Something doesn’t make sense 🤔
27:27   I don’t see any changes
if i was usa, i’d just give the british the land
Sheeeesh, that All Star lyrics so good:  But the Americans keep coming And they don't stop coming 30:43
PLEASEEEEEE MAKE A VIDEO ON INDIA'S FREEDOM STRUGGLE. I BEG YOU.
The iconic nordvpn
Dear Oversimplified,  PLEASE make more Berkshire Pig merch. the pin is amazing but a plush or a hoodie would be 10/10  Sincerely, a huge fan
“The Fourth of July in Montreal” LMAO  Quebec has been Canadian since 1867 (and before that British since 1759) and even today there’s a strong succession movement and major cultural differences from the rest of Canada. The US is welcome to try but enjoy the Lower Canada Rebellion Partie Deux 😆
Sharon’s cat can speak to god
I just noticed the map of vietnam on the table of the border people
Is it me or does it look like San Juan Island looks like a mini Europe that’s not connected via land?
I do believe it was destined for us to be come a nation and expand. Every nation in history has done it.
More affordable insulin 🤣🤣🤣

If only Lyman was smart enough to put the fourth fence up so that the pig wouldn't eat his potatoes
POV Canadians after seeing the ending: lol good luck with our cold mountains and traveling through ice buckos
The only history videos i accept
25:56 See Jeff. Look at that! We’re about to get blown to bits! all according to plan… hang on… OH CRAP. JEFF. WE’RE ABOUT TO GET BLOWN TO BITS RUN!
Real easy to snark on white Christians. But as Billy Joel would tell you, We didn't start the fire.
I love how oversimplified has taught me so much
Invade Canada? I’m in. We could connect the  mainland with Alaska. Also WTH dude. You turn into a devil or something?
We’ll we’ll just set the White House on fire again and Canada has never lost military war
this man explains an 8 week unit in 40 minutes.
i have a feeling he bought way too many stock photos and needed an excuse to use them
The pig was secretly a skinwalker and that’s why he shot the pig
Amazing closing
If we actually Concord Canada ww3 would start or ww4 or ww5
0:47 russia flag
All-Star from 7:57-8:06
Being an American 🇺🇸I loved that end
20,559,000th view
Pure amazingness
And God said unto man thou whoth maketh Mac and cheese shall rule and whoever makes Kraft singles will burn in hell
This man does nord vpn ads so masterfully I’m gonna download it 😂😂
Dude funniest Oversimplified Vid ever
British pig: *dies* United Kingdom: "Dude, SUPER uncool!"
They made me cry like a big girl.
Weirdo
29:18
I'll take Alberta. The rest of Canada sucks though
That ad transaction was smooth
3:36 Florida💀
Hey Bozo, the true king of stick history, Sam Onella has returned. Ripoff
What about Bulgariа
I love the idea at the end of the video lol
"a bunch of different people already live out west" *shock and sadness* "whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't say they were WHITE people"  *cheering*
8:01 he referenced smash mouth right their
When I first saw this video, I thought it was something about Technoblade's 23rd cousin.
Bro that ending!!! snapped lmao
Harney looks like Luis Inácio Lula da Silva     DO NOT JUDGE ME!
USA:u know the rules and so do I -loads gun-SAY GOODBYE
British:look let’s just keep the line strait
USA:hmmm what we do
oversimplified better count his days because big Papi Britain will burn down the whitehouse again for insulting Canada
oversimplified better count his days because big Papi Britain will burn down the whitehouse again for insulting Canada
Nothing but love for our neighbors to the North, eh.
Wait...."Hawaiian Shepherds"......?
the pig war was just foreshadowed technoblade but not the correct death
Draw????? lol, oversimplified do better
What  people from different countries think America is like: 4:11 7:25 16:33 17:58
38:04 you don’t even mention anything about Slovakia
why didn't they just hold a referendum on the island to let the inhabitants decide if they want to be British or American? I don't see any harm in that....
Lol you just started the YouTube war
I wish I could up vote this more than once.  Even after the third time watching, the video still cracks me up, especially the delightfully deranged and oh so patriot ending. 😊
I swear nord comes when you least expect it☠️
will you ever make a video about wars that occurred in Yugoslavian countries?
I love how they plop down McDonald's restaurants We're going to have McDonald's on the moon soon
AK 47’S AREN’T AMERICAN! THEIR VIETNAMESE.
7:57 that was a very good Shrek reference. Correction: All-Star Reference.
This video got me into raising big beutiful berkshires XD
Ah socialist animator. Cool
7:56 bro rlly made a parody on all star and made a seamless transition back to track
Why do you try to make our American ancestors seem as evil as possible? You are nothing but a trend follower who will do and say whatever is most mainstream to get clicks.
I wish theres a history part where 2 massive country made a war but in the middle of the war some people team up and formed theyre own country
14:30 oh so that’s how it is huh? That’s how it’s gonna be is it?  That’s the way in which things are eh?
Invading Canada would be super easy, barely an inconvenience
Manifest Destiny wouldn't have mattered if the Natives were white, if they were white and lived the same way the Native Americans did (tribal society, stone age technology etc.) It would've panned out the same way lmao, like if your a 5 grade bully and see a 3rd grader with something you want your gonna take it because they can do little about it, same thing applies to expansion
That ending tho
This was made on my B-Day :D
What an ending
The best part about this video is its ending XD XD
and use lose by tiny communists party
you know no one wants war
BEST ENDING EVER !   🤣😂
The royal fleet obeys the order, shoots on the americans, Pickett dies, US and the british go to war, US invades Canada, it stretches their resources and manpower, secession war starts, yankees are weaker, Pickett doesn't charge in Gettysburg and so the confederate manage to get a stale mate, the war is over, the northern US controls canada and the northern states, the confederation controls the confederate states and sooon after to grow stronger invades and conquers Mexico, now the north american continent in split in two between union and confederation alongside mason dixon line.
You love to see it
My last name is Douglas. I don't know how to act, or what to say; except to say that "Douglas" is more Scottish than English
I love Charles and Lyman's different versions of the story
this ending aged somewhat well
And once again, Germany comes and saves the da- oh wait
18:41 pump action double barrel? is this Doom?
S/S Steamy McSteamface is my favorite steam ship
whoaa,, you have blocked video? awesome...
invade canada
This sounds way better than the history text books in public schools.
​I tried to save a bird yesterday but my cat was messing with it so I put it right next to a cat grave, it died right there. I named the cat "Bird killer". The bird was already bleeding cause of the cat. My uncle said there is a bird so I went outside and the cat was playing with it for no reason. The cat it's my sisters she doesn't care what he does he is a outside/inside cat. Anyways back to the bird. The bird was kind of alive but it was bleeding on it's right wing so I put it right next to a grave and it slowly dying. I checked on the bird and I moved it a little and it was dead. I feel bad I want a bird as a pet..- ;-; 🐦😭
Ah yes an America. Welding a soviet ak-47
Hi so I just woke up and for some reason I was on this video now I don't remember clicking on this video so I'm confused cuz I do remember that was extremely sleepy and  before it was day time and now it's night time when I woke and I still can't believe I miss that party 😭😭😭I need to start sleeping more
That's actually really funny about the British removing the flag pole so the Americans couldn't raise their flag.
7:58 Smash mouth line reference.
I clapped when this ended
The last couple 'o minutes got me slightly upset, eh.
bro just rapped.
🌐idk why
This video legit got me a free history assignment
America grew a Florida as a ****
i could not stop laughing when lyman killed the pig.
I can’t figure out if oversimplified is American or not lol
Wasn't prepared for a smath mouth reference (well I kinda was).
it so funny
I geel like oversimplified wrote this script very, very drunk xD
Bro i swear nordvpn is inlove with your channel
Sure I will keep an eye out lol😂
I think we can take em
Why was porky dressed like Al capone
“Woah woah woah, I didn’t say they were white people” 😂😂
Isn’t that Mabel’s pet pig
This is how schools should teach
I still can't stop thinking about a standing Berkshire Pig talking about climate change with Morgan Freeman voice.
So did OverSimplified predict Dark Brandon?
I’m loving the crazy patriotism at the end there! USA! USA! USA! 🇺🇸
As a Canadian the ending was worrying
how does this man keep getting sponsored by nordvpn
7:24 ?
Can jou make a video about the trojan war
1812. Pretty much a draw except the USA sued for peace….
31:27 I love how exaggerated his side of the story is.
Is the pig morgan freeman
Americans being Americans. Cool.
Star Wars A New Hope Parody  (Pig Wars A New War) :D
Lovely patriotic outburst in the end!
Best words to hear 2:50 (I love napoleon)
38:43
Oh man the "let's make the world a better place, just as God intended!" followed by what I could only describe as chaotic American-ism. Tremendous!
GREATEST OUTRO EVER MADE!!!!!!!!
Me when the pig gets shot : LMAOOO headshot
At 18:48 The Way he said "Lyman Shot the pig" as if it's gonna cause an apocalypse just to find out that nothing really happened in the end 😂😂 Flattered by his story telling skills..
And this guy is American welp time to go back to Britain  Me:hey there is this guy…
Yes it’s a plushie that is over simplified  12:06  Also wait a minute IS THAT WADDLES
Don't go nuts
you gonna start WW3
The ending left me dead😂😂😂
I just love how you think America invented the concept of displacing people
3:57 killed me
If "manifest destiny" was the cause of Western expansion in the US,...what was the Canadian excuse?
NATO when america invades Canada. You invaded a member
How to not use nord vpn to watch a certain oversimplified video - change your f*cking timezone
I lost track of how many times I laughed out loud this video 😂😂😂
14:46 English left the chat
7:39 i love the poem uwu
the british attended 4rth of july 😂😂
someone gives this man a medal !!!
autro was like wtf
the ending bro 😂😂😂😂
Something seems off… maybe it’s the way he pronounces resources…. Only a true Canuck would say “re-zources”!  He’s actually Canadian!  Bum, bum, baaaaaaaa!
USA doesn't have to invade anything, like always its wait for Quebec to destroy Canada from the inside.
USA!! USA!! USA!! USA!!
“Am I the asshole for killing a British pig?”
I love all your videos but you have to remember that America is not a country (USA is), it's a continent. Just a simple comment from a fellow american!
The Pig War
When I live in Philippines (Asia) is basically on the opposite side of the world had no things with it:eh,let’s see this
14:02 Such a based American move. I'm not even a Yank and I feel the pride.
idk if by joking about Biden at the end was at all patriotic haha Great video till the blinding white vegetable at the end
Potato seeds..
4:10 yup sounds about right
"Settled." LOL Just don't ask about places like Point Roberts, "Washington!" Pt. Roberts sticks south from Canada, across the border line. So only the southern end of it is part of the USA. To reach the rest of the USA (without swimming, flying, or boating) you need to drive  through Canada. There are STILL people on both sides in that area, who would be willing to fight over that tiny bit of land and a couple others like it. I used to live nearby in Blaine... it wasn't a topic we dared discuss with strangers!
This video suddenly reminds me of an old joke.  Rush Limbaugh was driving in a limo when suddenly his car runs over a pig.  Limbaugh tells the driver that he should probably tell the farmer what happened.  So the driver is gone for hours and when he finally comes back he's blind drunk.  "What did you say" says Limbaugh.  "All I said was I'm Rush Limbaugh's driver and I just killed that pig".
canada is better then america you cannot change my mind (socialised healthcare forever private healthcare never america!!!!!!)
Bruh oversimplified just predicted world war 4
I'm still wonder how @OverSimplified convinced Morgan Freeman to lend his voice for the pig
Why the pig 😢
Sounds like America stole Canad's land. Figures.
When the British took the island, I see why perfectly fine, but each could’ve shared but the brits were there first. That American killing that pig is the gosh darn sadness thing I heard T-T. I say the brits shall get that soil I mean someone’s property was destroyed because someone was not smart enough to put a fence around his crops
Dont worry, Canada, we dont want your cold af country. We can be friends, we only ask for bacon.
love your videos pure comedy lol i laughed the whole time i watched someone send this to president drake lmfao !!!!!!
Doesn't Florida look like America's.. uh.. uh.. special thing?
17:32 Me when I discover I had a difficult exam I didn't study for
Buchanan, or Brandon?
Were you talking about Harney or Brandon? :|
Well, here are some actual facts:  1: The New Settelers where not comitting 24/7 genocide on the indians, in fact ~20/1, conflicts where settled with contracts and payments for land, etc... This was the case until the US civil war. Things got much worse from there.  But until then, the 20/1 ratio also counts in the wars iniciated by the Indiand (like e.g. the King Philip's war).  2: You think the USA did not make the country a better place, compared to what it was before?  Then read a book! Or visit some other indigenous tribes that still live fully without western aid. See how long you last, u probably won't grow old enough to see 30 years of age. Most deaths are violent ones and nature is cruel. Have fun!   Èasily the weakest video of this channel. But at least in flow with mainstream degegeneration due to affluent neglect and lack of appreciation of the things and civilisation we have and we can all share in peace and long and healthy lifes.
Listen man.  I’m a wehraboo that hates the UK okay.. But I gotta say. USA is much more hipocritical than UK.
13:28 The best moment
i remember reading somewhere that Canadian army is like super hard core or something along those lines, Canadians are generally really nice people though, i wonder what would happen if they snapped and went to war... their battle cry would be apologies for the pain and death thy are about to inflict, charge south riding on moose and grizzly bears and after they smash the US forces they will move on to terrorize the poor citizens with public healthcare... i know... terrifying
The pig suddenly standing up was so unsettling lmao
I think the creator of this channel is batshit crazy,  and I love it.
how long did it take to make the whole invasion of Canada speech?
Oh America.
Hi
I like how one of the highest Confederate losses is by this bozo
32:30 is the best part
Can u do a video bout Lebanese civil war please !!
the ending made me laugh so hard
As a diabetic, the stab at affordable insulin was good
I am dredging the day when Oversimplified will create a video on how the CCP took over China and switched to Simplified Chinese and getting rid of hundreds of years of Chinese history.
32:03 took me about 3 full views to realize that could be a far cry 3 reference
Sleep with one eye open Canada
Now I completely understand why they kinda breeze through this war in school 🤣🤣🤣
why was i genuinely sad when spuddy was eaten
What
I wonder if someday Canada will become part of America
That pig looks suspiciously like Waddles from "Gravity Falls." Coincidence?
Finds a dog 20:34
This border dispute of USA and British North America kind of reminds me of the border dispute between Germany and the Netherlands at the most northern point of the border at the Ems, but this one is there since 1509 and they still haven't solved it.
Right now civilians that actually have a job and ambitions to own land and have a family are all on the same side.  Regardless of Past government relations or current.
Nice drawing
Kinda looks like Star wars except the past
Can you do the crusades
You idiot don't incite war hahahahaha
Poor piggy
I’ve watched this video countless times and only now realized it says Density instead of Destiny at 3:39
Quick question is there actually a difference tween the two Mabz at 27:28 and 27:29
James Douglas was a genocidal maniac, you would not believe the 'treaties' he coerced indigenous people into. Complete psycho
My! My! Such a good video😂 I wish we could get more. Nothing to dislike whatever is being uploaded <3
love that subtle smash mouth jokoe
This is by far the best episode
this video happen😛
Cpt. Picket looks like Ian from forgottenweapons
Haven’t watched this video, but is it about the War that Russia is fighting right now?
Has anyone thought about at around 335, how with the placement of the stock legs on America, Florida looks like a huge dongle?
That is a really over simplified plushie
us Canadians are very aware of the treat, the most powerful military in the world right next to us? well we can't win militarily... or diplomatically so we, or more accurately "i" will win via acts of terrorism, it worked for al-Qaeda so surely it will for for us too
Typical muricans
No, really, it's okay to be bigoted against white people, and religion ... really
Isjzjsujsjxjsis
Cheese
19:22 tf2 medic
I feel like this entire video was so long (Longer than his WW2 videos combined) because he was so sick of hearing people ask him to talk about Canada more.
Anyone else know what march is playing at 16:27 its bothering me so much
Sorry to say it, but I'm pretty sure the Canadians would beat you
Literally the BEST ending of an episode. Did NOT see that coming. 🤣
Seriously I don't know who do the voice over for this video, but they're great at doing their job, especially that last part
Nah, we shouldn't invade Canada. They're such nice people and, while their country is also quite beautiful like our own,  they always let us come up for a visit. Also, all the countries in the world are going to need to work together so that we don't all extinct ourselves due to global warming. It's not going to matter who owns what or how rich anyone is if humans can no longer exist on this planet.  Having said that, I have never heard of this war but it might be due to the fact that I didn't see the importance of history when I was younger and only paid attention long enough to laugh at things like Lake Titicaca. I assumed that these funny words spliced together didn't have the same meaning in the native language but, as someone who has lived in Peru, I will simply allege that the tities are on the Peruvian side of the lake and the caca is on the Bolivian side and I ought to know since I've been to Lake Titicaca. lol
31:26 lol
your first graphic showing how Harvey's letter would travel to Washington, you have it traveling through Panama. The Panama Canal didn't exist in 1859, and ships would go all the way around the tip of South America. The second graphic you show it going across the continent, which might be a little more believable being just before the establishment of the Pony Express....but still
Ben Franklin would respond with, these curves were all on your wife last night!
I wonder where did the name of San Juan Island came from? 🤔 Maybe it was an Spanish territory after all XD
I agree with the end; you should have the white house burned down again.
as a Canadian leave our maple syrup alone! eh? EH?! EEEEHHH!!!!!
I don't vote out of principle, but I'd vote for Biden if he invaded Canada.
McDonalds sums up manifest destiny....
he mentioned Canada tho
He should remaster some videos
Biden invades canada Also biden: "where am I?"  I never realized how much America wants canada, absolutely insane stuff.
7:56 I saw what you did there and I hope I wasn't the only one.
I was not ready for that outro
THIS was the FUNNIEST one so far! 🤣
I'd like to know who said we don't have nuclear weapons??  I'm almost positive I live near a launch site.
By God. The ending was the greatest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Excuse me while I send this to my two Canadian friends
Wasn't that pig just a reskin of waddled from gravity falls......nice ummmm payed for art there....
Why does he sound like so many other people? I got major plankton vibes from that last bit lmao
Honestly I’m up for Americans invading us if Drake becomes president
6:53 the sponsor ends
Clicks something baited by the oversimplified assuming it'd be quick. I was about 30 minutes wrong
worst video. reeks of American propoganda
“Because Bidens coming baby”🤣
i forgot that america slaughtered natives and stole rightful land.
I wasn't aware of this conflict before, but as soon as I became aware of it I was really hoping the US would win and get the territory. The manifest destiny is real.
The ending to this made me tear up laughing. So good!
yea 100% sure that the us could totally invade canada      (is this a joke or somethin' bruh)
3:33 lol did USA just have grown a pinus?
I am from Whatcom County (We pronounce it WHAT (as in "ought" with a "wh" in front) COME  (like, you know, "come here")).  I learned about the Pig War repeatedly growing up.  Always told with a twinkle in they eye.  I have walked past the house Cpt Pickett had his HQ at in Bellingham.  I suppose that was before he moved troops out to San Juan Island.  I've also boated in those waters often.  I have to say that the notion that Haro Strait is deeper and wider than Rosario is backed up by the fact that all the current shipping to Vancouver, BC goes through it, not Rosario.  Anyway, I loved your video.  I learned things I didn't know, including the direct involvement of both Pickett and Winfield Scott.  I guess as an student in grade school, I didn't know who those guys were.  Thanks!
Oversimplified is a Canadian hater
i think the part about invading canada is a great idea
Good video i live in victoria so this was really intresting
By far oversimplifed worse video.
I love u
37:53, missed opportunity, using soulja boy's audio "Drakkeee?!"
Over Simplified just took a SHARP LEFT to Over Kill Comedy 🤪
I'm sorry but the bit in 19:10 was hilarious. He chose that classical music...
His American cartoon people are always hitting first... gosh America : "so young, so angry, dam* this rap music!"
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming..."   Okay 80s/90s kid.
Oversimplify I would like to see you Americans try 🤣 watch out for the trees 🌲 there might be someone hiding in them 👁️
I like to think that if General Scott could see his animated, stick figure-esque self beating the filling out of Harney, he would smile. Probably get some great (much needed) catharsis out of it too.
37:17  LETS GOO USA USA USA
I hopre the ending of this video won't start a war. Now that would be stupid
Watching this for the hundredth time just to fast forward and watch that ending again. Still a good video tho
Great video ahahah
4:03 is by far the best scene in this series
I mean you really were ahead of the meme with the Dark Brandon ending, I had forgotten about that till this celebratory rewatch binge, it's pretty impressive
As usual, government is the problem.
those islands aren't British or American, they're mine
The American history is really funny. You've saved my grades in history classes i guess  Thank you for making these videos!
This is nothing like the great emu war. I am much disappointed
Showing a crazed demonic Biden was so accurate.
I love how when the god light thing shines down the US says "IT'S MY DENSITY!!!"
Awe man, watching General Scott lay down the law in the last 5 minutes of the video gave me such great pleasure!
That seems a little overtop
not only a pig died but gosh darn spuds were
Harrased that man behind $80 and sheep
man i fckin love this channel
1:20 is so funny how he got rosted
The americans killed a pig and still won the favour of the germans. Unfair
The end of this video was THE BEST! 🤣🤣
I’m from British Columbia and my grandpas still pissed that the Americans “took everything” when the border agreement was made
Best. Ending. Ever.
13:00 🤣🤣🤣 "Take me to your leader" "Get off my island, yanky scum" "Watch your mouth, lambchop" "You're the nutjob talking to a sheep" "I'LL EAT YOUR EYES!"
Skoden
Canada (in my opinion) is one of the most overlooked countries to invade.
An iron as a phone  and final words 🇨🇦 - are really great, Oversimplified! 👏
8:11
7:16
The fact that Prussia was one of America's oldest European allies may have helped the American case with the Germans
7:04
33:28 So GOOD!!!!!!!
4:12 I didn’t know they had B2 bomber’s not in the modern age
Well this all because an idiot was in power.
Can we just not get into a war please?
This is so American
President Drake lol
He could’ve made a techno blade joke. Rip The Legend
That Biden's coming really got me.
Captions✨✨
Its my density?
Omg OverSimplified predicted Dark Brandon
32:32 This is literally the Screw you Screw you Screw you Screw you Your Cool Screw you And screw you I'm leaving
Congrats. You have covered Buchanan's whole presidency in 40 seconds...
YES LESS GOOOO
Recruiter: "And why are you signing up?" // Me: "Oversimplified told me you guys are invading Canada soon and I want to stick it to those smug Canadians"
The fact that most American history sounds so fake but is real is crazy
lmao taking the flag pole is such a great move
The sheep chat is rich. Well earned chuckle. Fantastic work as always.  Now I will have to randomly threaten to eat the eyes of my dissenters.   I mean, "baaaaaaaa."
If your sending biden we don't have much to worry about....
things to do: "Kick McClellan in the shins" ha
Did this video just predict Dark Brandon 😳 😂
6:00 dident work :(
27:11 Checkpoint (Me)
that intro's messed up😶😶LMAO
it was Billy, Billy spoke to god
57K comments, so not going to scroll through, but the typo of Density instead of Destiny is intentional irony, right? @3.38
37:11 was really scary for Canadians
Still patiently waiting for the Mexican American war series mainly the battle of the Alamo because I’m from the Alamo city lmaooo
Imagine having a war over Technoblade's icon (pig)
I thought you already covered the american revolution
I'm Canadian, but I kind of laughed to the ending because if Canada is attacked, other countries will protect us. Right???
Yeeeeeeeee Haaaaaaaaaaaaw!!
38:18  DARK BRANDON CONFIRMED!!!!
his pronunciation of berkshire is middle english
America, oh how I love your ridiculous history.
why does the potato have sonic shoes?
16:29
Honestly, I just love the bacon that came from the pig war.
Yeah, the 1812 was an American defeat. They failed their invasion and literally got the White House burned down xD The British just didnt bother much because they were occupied with Napoleon
America fought Canada once, we (America) lost (EDIT: bye fought, i mean an actual war)
Song at 13:35?
8:00 dude i was thinking about all star lyrics and this happened
If there's one thing I've learned from history about our polite neighbors to the north is that they are actually pretty good at war.
Literal tears at the ending.
Plz don't.
An incredible video. Thank you!
Or you could get avast a company outside the US so I get a company that won't willingly give my data to the government
U.S.A.: *Invades Canada under the premise of 'freeing' them from British oppression.* Canada and its British ruling country: *beat the tar out of the U.S.A.* U.S.A.: "Alright... We'll call it a draw."
The best until now,  the punic isn’t that much fun
What is the music for when the guy says don't talk about the gold and then the Americans come in
Objects Rise 4 is on September 24
That all star is perfectly sync
This ordeal should be made into a funny comedy movie
The price for the piggy nowadays would be like $4000
In the long run the Americans benefited from the straight line border because it gave us control of Puget Sound and the only useful ports in the northwest.
indians took land from each other long before the americans arrived. We were just better at it.
IDk why but even as an American it brings me great joy to know that the Brits were so petty that they removed a fucking flag pole so we couldn't raise a flag. That's my kind of pettiness.
uhh...I live in Canada.  please don't invade my country.
31:00 that was amazing
I was so hoping for this video to be about cops.
The “Biden’s coming back with a vengeance” hits different now that Dark Brandon’s made an appearance 😂
20:58 that hill looks juicy
Oversimplified makes history fun
"Because he was an American, he emerged with 4 pistols and a giant knife"  love it or hate it, everybody knew what Americans were all about back then lmao
American history is so funny. The entire history is about a people who live their lives by the motto "fuck you I'll do what I want" and I think that's beautiful, ignoring the atrocities of course
"So you tell me, dear viewers, which channels is the treaty refering to?" me: middle is middle
38:18 How did you predict Dark Brandon?
Hey can u cover the constitution of India or the partition or freedom fight.
Imagine an actual war happened that called "baaaaaa sheep war making battle sounds"
Love this channel. You learn and you laugh. Very entertaining. Keep up the good work.
I couldn’t stop laughing at 16:10
however, BEING AN American, he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols
Ah yes Florida is americas cock
OverSimplified is General Harney reincarnated.
USA invading Canada could be the best thing ever to happen to Canadians...
I can join in a Filipino let's get Canada!!!!!!!!
"Biden is coming with a vengeance."  That aged well.
what the fu-- -oversimplified
10/10 ending lol
I am good
If by Biden is coming you mean falling down steps and off his bicycle, then I think the Canucks are safe. The ending was glorious though😂
It may seem a funny little thing but it atchuly tells you real history
Canada needs nukes.
Laughable
Does anyone notice that map on the table in 5:01 it looks like a map of Vietnam
Canada will kick your ass
Yessssss
Am Canadian. "Bidens coming for you" got me good
Oversimplified made a Dark Brandon meme before it was cool.
"I hear voices ALL the time"
I can't wait for the White House to be burned down again!
As a British Columbian with British parents this video is really cool tbh
I released that when he sponsors nord VPN when the part where shows a video thats bloked It's always the Hitler video
They should put a warning at the beginning of this video. My manifest destiny is way too triggered right now. You can't set off Americans like this, it's dangerous!
Gotta love America
It's official that NordVPN owns OverSimplified and his channel
the (bad) pig war
Go to Macedonians United! Get the truth behind all the secrets of the Macedonian Nation and how've they gotten discriminated
These characters doin the fish, made my day.
THE ISLANDS ARE S'KLALLAM ISLANDS. I FISH THERE ALL THE TIME WE HAVE TREATY RIGHTS
major props for including Wy'east (mount hood) in the background of ft vancouver
I think I’m going to use that last monologue for an audition because holy I nearly teared up (as a Canadian!!)
As an American I can confirm we are all given a rascal with an ak and flag at birth
Why did a war start because of your mom
"I hear voices all the time..."
Crazy to realize that Mexico might be able to put up more of a fight than Canada in a war against the US.
nooo pig
Hahah, the ending was the best! Biden is coming for yah
And still, the ending of this video, after 5 times of rewatching it, still gets me laughing every time
American Mounties 🤣
Well, we could invade Quebec, but we'd have to do it right after brunch when they're all lowgie.
How did the editor miss the Florida penis at 334
my favorite part 18:58
Bro 4:08 made me rollin on da ground like rollin stones lol
I want the full Smashmouth parody.
Was…..was that a smash mouth reference???? This man is truly talented
These are so funny. Thanks for making them.
37:08
i am canadian so I was actually scared until he said Biden is coming
30:10 Why am I not surprised this doofus was friends with the likes of Jackson?
12:57 so how much family in Florida did he have?
I just want to say that the British are totally in the right.
27:25😂😂😂
Who voices the pig? It was beautiful.
I honestly expected that ending to be a transition to AlternativeHistory but I'm not sure about what I got instead.
That ending went full dark Brandon
"Like rats or desease" " I hear voices all the time" I love the sass thrown in history as it should.
38:12 Hey, it's Dark Brandon!
Holy shit the ending killed me
Gotta say... I was disappointed. I was rooting for the British to get them, no offence USA.
The ending is the most well-written sequence ever made in this channel's history LMFAOOO
What the heck was that ending lmao
I still love the ending bruh
These just keep getting better lmao
Honestly, I welcome our American occupiers.
White women are beautiful
God bless america eh?
What’s funny is that the US wouldn’t win a war with canada
that thumbnail is perfection
This is simple actually. British is Britain that’s all other countries asin Britain. So no matter what they have no rights to demand or even claim any land as theirs.
So to put it simply, hot-headed Americans being hot-headed Americans almost caused a very unnecessary war. Little did they know that this trend would carry over a hundred years later 🤣🤣
The Canadian government sucks ass , so let's turn Canada into 50 more states lol
How've I never heard of this before. & history is one of my main hobbies
If Canada still wants to invade, I for one welcome our new Mounty overlords. Come oppress us with your healthcare and gun control!
*Oversimplified plotting to invade Canada* As an American can I vote no on this plan? Last thing we need is to annex them and have Ontario gripe that Louisiana isn't speaking proper French or something like this. Let's just leave them be and take their TV shows for our streaming services. It's been a solid plan for years, don't mess with what works. lol
Anyone else notice the note similarity to “All Star”
Canadians sweating rn after the last 2 minutes of this vid💀
0:22 vid starts
pig wars: the brits awaken
33:25 trust me it's funny
NO you dont get canada f off
NO
if only he just had a 4th side on his fence
I’m ready to enlist for the American Canadian war
Someone should remember Canada.
Thing is if the us invaded Canada, they’d have to deal with the cobra chickens
Pretty much how Canadians feel today...
Ain’t nobody going to talk about the pig who looks like the pig from gravity falls.
33:25 the fact he was still there
"What the f-". 5:56-
That patriotism at the end, baby I am wet, and I am man.
I’m amazed Harney’s superior officer didn’t have him shot, at the very least clapped in irons, and detained.
How could you say that to our country you American it our maple syrup
They removed the flag poles Lmaoo. As an American I respect that.
I know you watched this more than once
😂🤣🤣🤣
4:18 now where have I heard that music before…
Don't you sare, ever, ever, insult Canada again. I am on the verge of unsubscribing and disliking all your videos.
7:58 WHEEZE TIMEEEE
Is 100$ that much back then
There a lot of gold we find
I’m  Australian and part Indian
As a Canadian I gotta say I'd rather be dead than be from the USA lol
This video was just a distraction to canadians, meanwhile OverSimplified is invading canada slowly and painful
I hope Canada becomes part of America
I hate the way victors write history.
And I thought trump was petty.... God bless... Ya know what, no .. god started this all by simply being a the power of nature.... Damn you mesopotamia!
Next thing you know nordvpn will be treated like piratebay.... Then where will we go for our french films?
Oh my Lord that ending was epic.. but I completely lost it when he said our glorious leader Drake. LMAO
31:00 i can't....holy shit that was amazing
I wanna invade Canada now.
This outro was probably my favorite
"Make america great again!"  "When exactly was america great?"  "During the founding fathers time and the 1800s"  America then: slaves and native american genocide
So, we just going to gloss over how Florida was just a hangin @3:33? Didn't know the US was packin'. I mean shit it's down to the ankles. Fucking jealous!
6:15 Its not general grievous,Its Old Buissnes tech wizz Greivous!
make this a song
27:29 most underrated joke in the whole video
The end was literally patriot oversimplified
Love ur videos man you history so fun
When you realize you’re about to get blown to bits 26:03
Shrek
Did anyone notice how the potato has sonic’s shoes
Those islands are the San Juan islands and every summer I go to the island just south of it called whidbey island
i got a starwars soap ad for this video probably because of the thumbnail
Yup Like listening to Ann Coulter. Watch your backs.
Worst American President after Trump.
9:19🤣😂
6:20 this guy want his subscribers to catch ear and eye inflammation lol
America ☕️
Straight line😂
Lol I’m the 59,970th comment
37:17 Canada and united kingdom: we are f***ed  Biden: you just got america'd!!
10:23 Just like Parliament today, lords, nobles, and other people just screaming at each other and throwing things at each other. Truly Bri'ish.
Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Porkous the wise? It is not a story an American will tell. . It's a Brit legend. Darth Porkous was a Dark Lord of the Brit, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create tea... He had such a knowledge of the British side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from drinking coffee. The British side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his taste of tea, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he told his enemy everything he knew, then his enemy killed him in his lunch, by slipping in some coffee. Ironic, he could save others from coffee, but not himself.
Ya one thing about Americans is we’re always toting 😭
Dude wants the fallout universe to happen
Hey guys, the wait is over. The first punic war is here.
Being American would be better than living under Justin Trudeau
Hey it’s Waddles.
Nah drake is crazy
General harneys sketch is so accurate
Now
New videos
Considering the state of the West Coast nowadays I fucking wish we could give Portland to Canada
Straight line?
"I heard it was Sharon's cat." Followed up by "I hear voices all the time" was hilarious
29:17 that scream xd
OverSimp
13:30 lol
I keep sending this video to friends and get a text in an hour like "only America would start a war over a pig. "
hey, OverSimplified, I live in Edmonton Alberta, and I have an opportunity to buy a pristine felt top hat from 1868, for $40. should I do it? it even comes in the original box
Funny I live in Vancouver island
The end is amazing haha
I made a pulled pork sandwich and mashed potatoes during this video. 😇
So is this what Black Sabbath were singing about?
The curtain
Seeing Pickett and Scott here is like seeing the younger main character in a prequel movie.
BEAUCHANAN!!!
I like how at 16:02 the American guy pulls out a AK-47 even tho that is a Russian weapon and still hasn’t even been invented yet 😂
Not the Pig being Morgan Freeman in da British story🤣
He doesn’t talk about Canada because it didn’t get free of England till the 1900s
Aka brits we’re being reasonable for the Americans American say no I want it  Brits say ok  Brits have island  American I want it  Brits no American war  Brits :/
Americans invading Canada will always picture me of that scene from Fallout 1 intro.
All star reference
Man-infest Destiny
when the world needed him the most he vanished
This video made my day! As always - super awesome, keep it up :D
It’s all fun and games fighting Canada until they begin water boarding prisoners with maple syrup.
I’m dying after that ending
Hilarious. I love your videos. If history was taught in public schools the way you present it,  America would be full of informed historians.  Can't wait for your next one.... well I mean, I've already seen your next one.... both parts.... but I mean the next, next, next one.
I really like your content, but not the blatant hate on Christianity
My funny timestamps: 3:43 7:23 9:02 13:25 16:18
Yeah while he's falling down the stairs too lol
Pig? Like technonlade sure makes me think of him 😢😢😢😢 RIP…
3:38 Florida kinda looks like a dong
Americans☕
1812 Nord VPN first version
Britain: how the about border goes on the river so we both have a 50/50? USA:….you’re in American U SPEEK ENGLISH
11:08 when you have an argument with your sibling.
Holy fuck, I've literally been to fort Vancouver to play Pokemon GO without having any idea it had any real historic significance other than being some old wooden buildings.
"emerged with four pistols and a large knife, so the brits had to back down" may be the single most American thing ive ever heard of.
Oversimplified Vietnam war pls
Man. I miss racist America. So many interesting things happened when America was racist
This
Know what the fact this is the ONLY channel i’ve come across where ever video is EQUALLY  interesting/fun to watch just proves that this channel is Oversimplified. WOOOO
37:18 not to be a buzz kill but why not is because of peace treaty’s and if America invaded Canada America would have to fight a war against all of nato and probably more and also Canada supplies America with supplies sooo ya that’s why 🤓🤓🤓🤓
I've flown over that archipelago in MSFS. It's nice.
That ending will go down as one of the funniest in history.  Lmao 🤣
Update: He's back
He always go to Adolf hitler every video with the NORD VPN SPONSOR
Outstanding outro
It’s been a year daddy We really really need you
oversimplified you alive?
This  video was different from your previous videos, in the context of its filled with more cringe jokes than necessary. Napoleonic Wars was one of your best videos. But this video is lame, ,maybe because the war was also lame and thus not very popular.
14:35 oh so thats what happened eh?!
I would like to remind everyone that in the first days after this video was released, it got #1 trending in Canada, with the golden caption by Oversimplified: "Welcome to the empire".     (I also got an ad for protecting American pigs against African Swine Fever right after this video, so take that as you will)
Guys I think he’s ded….The Canadians got to him
Waiting for the next vid
Dude are you alright? We haven't heard from you in like 5 months
“Oversimplified” Has NEW PINS on a “PRE” Sale of “Roman” and “Carthaginian” Soldiers so with this information It’s looking like the New video is gonna be about the “PUNIC WARS” yet not sure when hill post it but it’s looking like that
bro where the new vid?
Kazakhstan
Can you do one about Constantinople or like the franks? bc thats what im studying at school :D
Maybe you should deal with the Russian crisis before bothering with Canada…
Wait I'm just curious when is the next vid ????
im starting ap euro this year so start doing european contact cause ill enjoy it <33
im canadin
33:28
Do you remember your mini wars series, how about doing one of those about the skirmish of Fox Creek during the american Civil war. It happened on March 7th, 1862
90s pop puns. Epic
When's the next video 😫
God fuck as a resident of Victoria if we ended up as American territory I would have killed myself a longgg time ago.
-35:20-- the thing in between the leg- OMG I NEED TO STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT AHHHHH
I miss him
Canadian here.... about that ending: no.  lol
8 months

Your video’s are the best. Please come back!!!
The king is here where is the king in American Ever video all hail oversimplified
Guys it’s been almost 8 months now… I don’t think dad is coming back with a new video…
I Wonder What Happened to Oversimplified :(
I remember learning this in high school but man you made this so funny!
With how the Canadian Government is going, I welcome the lack of health care and more guns.
I bet he’s gonna upload on the day this video was released December 6th
Come back 🥲
in my Book, this is simply the best oversimplified video ever
Can you do the troubles
Imagine if he had closed his pig pen...
Yep, no white people ever took territory from white people. Never happened.
Perhaps he is working on part 1 AND part 2 of vietnam?
That think on the end was the Best part of video
Is this channel dead?
i watch this about every 3 month because its so entertaining. MANIFEST DESTINY BABYYYY
I love the end but i'm Canadian
do a operation mincemeat oversimplified :D
Julius Ceaser next??
Oversimplifed is shit
Is he gone I think so good hunt you're fired pick it you're going back on the island all right you psychopath I've been waiting years for this
Guys it's fine. Oversimplified didn't get kidnapped and brought to Canada. His Gout is just acting up.
I will kill myself if a new video (hopefully Vietnam) doesn’t come out soon.
I think the Canadians got him
If you hate America so much, go move somewhere else.
Ok jokes over... Can you come back now please
When are we getting another video!!!
My history teacher would always play this
Ur video schedule as worse as fearless
Maple syrup the best American food 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should do the French and Indian war
Man just just made this video then dipped for 8 months | he came back, no more is this comment relevant.
This man is ALWAYS Sponsored by nord bro 😭
The transition for nordvpn 🤣
I'm going to come back to this comment every month oversimplified doesn't upload   The edits will be here
I'm going to come back to this comment every month oversimplified doesn't upload   The edits will be here
The only casualty was JUST a pig.. Canadian Vegans: and I took that personally  Edit: autocorrect made vegans VEGAS.
As a Canadian I feel threatened lol.
I’m actually beginning to get concerned, I love oversimplified but I also know it takes forever and can be stressful to make videos like this, hope ur doing ok man 👌
I would have said the channel what divided them in the middle so the British could have that giant Island and we could have the rest
can you do the mexican revolution?
I love the Star Wars lines
We miss you man
can you polish-bloshivekis war?
Man its been 80 years now... release the video man ,please man!
Uhhh oversimplified I'm from Canada? (But I'm still subbed)
Yes you are right we should conquer Canada and send them back to Britain, Amurica!
I’m it’s been 8 months come back already pls!
its been 8 months come on bruu
this guy is definitely writing the script for his next video on russia and ukraine
Its been 8 months pls comeback
its been 8 months since oversimplified's last upload, i think i'm starting to lose hearing in my left eye
Oh you also here waiting for the Next Perfect Video
12:53 is really funny
HE died
8 months, I wonder what video he’s going to make next?
Me still waiting for the next upload
When that one dude asked - "Who was it who spoke to God?"... I swear I heard someone say, "I thought it was Sharon's cat." (or something like that)
Well, if WW3 starts, I think we’ll know why
It's been 8 years
We're getting an Oversimplified movie, folks. I can taste it.
waiting for vietnam
Oh no, oversimplified went crazy!!   It was a great way to end the vid, good job
Where you been@
This is the most hysterical thing I have ever seen! Thank you so much for all you do.
I would love a video on Alexander the great or Alexander the not so great
I have a sudden and overwhelming urge to take up arms against Canada
Here's a question, after Lyle shot the pig. did they at least turn it into Bacon? or... would they have needed to make it Canadian Bacon because the Pig was Canadian?
Imagine this video was the only thing that would represent humanity to aliens
38:04 are you threatening us >:O
It's good to see how captain hornby was genuinely working for his nation cuz by British law him landing troops by the order of the superior official wouldn't make him liable for anything,but he risked his job for the country
As someone who lives up the road from Fort Vancouver, can confirm that the characterization of such is accurate.
Wow That was amazing I fascinated with it. Lovelyyyyyyy❤
Boiii….. enough holidaying. Get to work.
FINALLY A STAR-WARS REFERENCE FROM THE THUMBNAIL
i just figgured it out its taking so long because hes doing the 100 years war
i wish oversimplified uploaded more               i keep having dreams about him
S. Webster (OverSimplified) had been arrested for Xenophobic Hate Speech against Canada, He will be tried in 10 Days.
Feel bad for the pig man!
When’s the next video
It been 8 months, any day now he'll drop a banger of a vid, I wonder what war tge next vid gonna be about? Korean war? Vietnam war? 7 year war? ... ww3
Could you make the next video about the Vietnam war ?
Potato + pig = bad combination
He is waiting for WW3
I bet they are waiting for the Russian Ukraine  war to end so they can make a video of it  lol
Bro where are you
33.20when you fined the camper that's been killing you for the whole game.
Bro make a new video
UPLOAD MORE VIDEOS RIGHT FUCKING NOW
Putin sees the end of this video: "Attack your neighbor unprovoked?  What a great idea!" People of Ukraine: "Dude. Uncool."  Seriously though, thoughts and prayers go out to the people of both nations that a peaceful solution is found to the conflict soon.
there couldn't have been a perfect ending to this
I’d like this suggestion: Napoleon oversimplified plush
as a canadian, i will indeed sleep with one eye tonight
Where is oversimplified
At 16:38 what is that music called
Bro when the next vid
as long as you keep the healthcare system, please invade us
Me getting happy to see if OverSimplified uploaded new vid yet :)))))))) Me legit two seconds later realizing he has not uploaded - :( Me realizing he has not uploaded in TWO MONTHS - We are gathered here to respect the passing of OverSimplified a friend to some, leader, icon, symbol, and the guy that gives me all my random facts. So pull out your Goergy pins and get on your piggy war t-shirt as we commence the passing of OverSimplified (For real though if no one seen u in eight months in my town people thinking u got shot or worse)
Did you die?
Cool video Eh! (EDIT): Canada is better than the US, we got hockey!
This is amazing
This is not oversimplified . 38 mins
More
Hello ! 8 month and *NO* video ?! You OK buddy ?
Can you do the Korean War or the vieatnam war pls
Double video coming? Why you take so long? I need a video 😔
I love the ending 😂😂😂😂
maybe i am general harney
very cinematic
for americans guns are regular things
I think this is one of the best historical stories i have ever heard 😂😂😂 i had no idea whatsoever this ever happened. Harney seems like a really... Ahem ..... Unique guy 😂😂😂
I personally think America should have gone with the agreement that Canada made where you guys would split it through the middle Channel Canada is actually cooperable but you can't cooperate with America I don't even care and I think Canada is better than America
I love how Florida grows out to be USA's *clears throat* y'know at 3:31.
please make a video on russian civil war
make a Greek revolution video
Hey oversimplified, are you good? I'm kind of getting worried now that its been eight months since you last updated.  No rush, just really worried...
I’m sorry but please come back, I need to learn more about history
And when the world needed him most, he vanished
where next video :(
Dude where are you, how else are supposed to enjoy history :(
Restricted in my country
When are you going to upload
Please do the INDIA V PAK WAR OF 1971 ….please @OverSimplified
New video when?
Guys I don't think he's making a new video this year, I'm pretty sure he's trying to start a new war between the US and Canada right now before the year is out lol  Edit: well well well, it looks like the seeds of your schemes have been well watered and might deliver sweet fruit with your goals with Canada Oversimplified..
Even as an Australian, that ending got me a little wet and wild hey
We need a Mexican American war
After watching this video a little over a hundred times or so I have come to realize that when the pig was killed lymen cocked back a double barrel from the bottom
rest in peace, my friend.
Suggestion:the pastry war between Mexico and France
he hasnt uploaded in 8 months. Hes probably working with the CIA to take over Canada
Gonna keep commenting this until we get a video on the Latin American wars of independence

“Alright you psychopath I’ve been waiting years to do this”: proceeds to beat him with a stick
Now I gotta be patient for OverSimplified's next video. It's worth it.  Also, If people think the video got banned from their country... Well then..            YOU SHOULD USE NORDVPN!-

Hello, i've been following your channel for quite some time now and I am especially fond of extra history and mythology. I was wondering if you could make a few videos about the Turkish Independence War(especially now that 30th of August coming up). I have never seen anything about it on any international channels. It is drastically overlooked considering how it affected other nations to gain their independence. Thank you
what happend to him
Bro are you dead?
8 months dude still waiting
Anybody see the Russian flag
I guess Oversimplified forgot his YouTube Password
You should do one of the Yugoslavian wars of the early 90's.
I grew up on the furthest north west of the disputed islands. I have been to both British and American camps on San Juan where I went to high school in the ‘90’s.
Please more videos
Please stay out of canada 😅
Bro pls come backkk
Jit dead 💀
i love the ending to each video,  especially this one
Hey oversimplified what happened
OVERSIMPLFIEID DID U DIE
Can you do the Irish civil war next?
is oversimplified still making videos? if he is, but just doesn't have any more wars to cover then I have a suggestion. just a battle, so it could be turned into a short video. like 5-10 minutes long, and my suggestion is the Battle of Stamford Bridge. (my fav battle of all time) would love to see it:)))
I’d love to see Oversimplified make a video on The Witch Trials somewhere down the line
Your channel died 😭 can you do roman wars ya know
Um so is he still active…
Are you dead?
Oversimplified uploads :🤠 They dont upload for the next 8 months : 💀
Can u make war of roses oversimplified?
Bro.. Seriously. Why are you?
Can you do next vidio 'Türk history' or 'Atatürk life'  eye of the american
16:27 my favorite part
“Being American, he emerged from the tent with four pistols and a big knife”  Sounds about right.
youre next video should be the crimean war
Last
When the two guys are discussing the straight line you can see a map of Vietnam on the table. Is this a foreshadowing?
8 months :(
Hey-I just resized this video is about a war started by a pig and potatoes...Techno?😳🐽👑

Imma say this now oversimplified and history matters are pretty much the two best animated history channels both have great humor and are great at teaching us about all kinds of history
I know it was Sharon's cat.
Canada and the us are allies, sorry but if your other allies see that you don't hesitate to invade them HA!!! Wrong move my man, wrong moveee~
“God told us we should do this!” The crowd: “YEAH!” “Who did he tell?” One guy: I thought it was Sharon’s cat…
when u gonna post another vid???
Waiting for the next oversimplified video like 💀
Apperently Oversimplified is busy invading Canada
Oversimplified please come back. I miss you
Tge American's were wrong in all this. Auctioning off people's sheep? WTF is wrong with you theives.
U can invade if u want but just remember that we have both Deadpool and darth Vader on our side. Thanks for showing the area I grew up.😸
I was born the exact day oversimplified join youtube
Hence PETA doesn't like  general Scott (a pig hater).
Oversimplified waiting room. I can't believe it's already been 8 months since their last video lol.
The tourist boat is called steamy mcsteamface. Oh my god. We British actually have a navy boat called Boaty McBoatface.
It’s been 8 months daddy. Pls come back.
And oversimplified was promptly assassinated for leaking the invasion plans from the CIA.
Anybody catch him make his own version of smash mouthed all star to explain the Oregon trail? Genius
It's been 8 long months-if he's working on something, it must be his magnum opus
We gotta come out with new wars so this guy can make content again
Day 44 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Do Ukraine and Russia next pls
Make video on indian history
When can we get a video about relevant history
fun fact: this is the longest it's ever taken him to release a new video, could just be that he has something big planned but idk
It's been over 6 months, where's the next video????
Ah yes captain pickett of pickett's charge fame. Little known to have also cloned himself to be in two places at once. Commanding on San juan island and fighting for the confederate army at the same time! And hunt there also going awol staying on the island and starting a family on the island that presists to this day.   So since OS couldn't be bothered to give simple and accurate info here is a quick simple run down.  Pig is shot Farmer threatened with arrest American settlers petion local army General sends Pickett  Brits send 2 ships Pickett moves camps -back and forth a few times he was an idiot- Royal marines land on otherside of island and set camp. Orders come from both sides not to escalate Pickett goes awol to join confederates in the Civil war. Hunt is new commander for americans Tensions ease parties ensue Civil war ends The kaiser agreement happened  The san juans are American all of Vancouver is Canadian. Royal marines leave American take control of british camp Hunt stays CO of troops until they are recalled. -started a family on the island descendants are still there‐  A few notes: Yes the southern tip of Vancouver was also being contested as American. they really liked that line.  The first settlers were American and not Hawaiian that family is still there too. The tax offical came to see them and found the british were there during the same trip.  The sheep plays out mostly right accept there were no native raiders and the sheep's were auctioned to the American family.   Lastly this is the first i have ever heard of an American conspiracy to start a war with the British. Its laughable reminded pickett is the guy who thought it would be a good idea to charge into the middle of a union battle line. Schemer he was not.
Wen next vid its been 8 months
can you do the Philippines when the spaniards came?
Straight line? Straight line. Lol
As an American patriot myself, I am all for the annexation of Canada by the United States of America. Not just to fix some border gore, but because all of the great stuff Canada has that America can have.
Hurry with new video please 😭
32:45 funniest part I’ve seen in an oversimplified video
Just patiently waiting for the next video still hoping for that Vietnam video
Hilarious hey maybe you can make an African one that would be cool 😎
I wish you’d do crusades next

Straight line?   Straight line!

This video could also be called: "proof that americans have always been hotheaded warmongers and that they'll lead us all to the Armageddon" or yknow, something like that
sorry i by accident clicked unlinke
The ending was absolutely the best part
Day 43 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Man’s making a Ukraine one lol
Normally he posts every 5-6 months, but it's been 8 so I'm starting to worry.
Oversimplified: *doesn't post for 8 months* The fans: gUyS hE iS dEaD!!1!!!1!1!1!!!1!1!

Hey, please make a “war of 1812 OversimPlified” i subbed.
When’s he coming back!! 😭
The reason oversimplified has not uploaded is because he is busy invading Canada.
Was the incorrect number shown on the calculator the amount it would be now? If so that’s awesome writing
Vietnam war ? 😢
Where’s Vietnam 😢😢😢😢
Parents: you don't learn anything on YouTube. also YouTube:
The next video better be a 3 part video about vietNam
That All-Star reference at 7:58 <3
13:29 At first I thought he meant that the Americans threatened to have a seizure if the British didn't hand over money.
This reminds me how petty governments can be.  American: (builds a picket fence around his garden) Britain: Hey! This individual picket is one inch on my property! American: And your tree grew roots on my land! American and British governments: THIS MEANS WAAAAAAAR
10:02 And the sensible ones (who by the way didn't exist) insisted that the channel the treaty was referring to was the middle channel, separating the islands down the middle.
I really wish you'd stop swearing in these videos. My kids love your videos, but once I caught the swearing I no longer let them watch.
dude, uncool
Time for a new oversimplified video
Unsuscribe because your American speech
are you living?
August 23rd, 2022, and still waiting on the next episode
I Like your videos soo much❤️they always make my day

Do the American-Indian wars

I felt that energy in the end🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲
its been a year daddy
Day 42 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Man I've Been Waitting...  WHERE ARE YOU OVERSIMPLIFIED. GIVE US MORE VIDEOSSS

Listen I saw the song version of All star
We want to see Oversimplification of  1. Vietnam War  2.Chinese civil war 3. Korean War 4. Jozef Stailin  5.Soviet-Finnish war.       Suggest others in comments
uh, why is a random irishman falling in love with a pig?
After that last part, im not sure my first highschool day (tomorrow) will be spent being awake, XD
"Well then you. My friend should use NORDVPN!" "What the f"
8 months holy shit where are you?
Anyone else go to Google maps before the end to see who won the islands?
Greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeece🇬🇷🏛🇬🇷🏛🇬🇷🏛🇬🇷🏛🇬🇷
whulta put your video away wultar i dont whanna have a video with you whalta
New Westminster, in British Columbia, used to be the Capital, and was build across the Fraser river on a rather steep hill as a fortified city and potential battlefield. The city hall still has cannons pointing south in symbolic reference to this era.
I like how you're becoming crazier with every video. The quality is a lot better although it was always good. And the comedy improves exponentially.
Need more simplified!!! Hope you can bring new videos soon
Thanks loved it.
A video on the Kashmir war would be something I’d be interested in seeing. It’s a war that not a whole lot of people talk about but an interesting premise on why Pakistan and India were fighting.
Um America is fighting 2 countries right now
Do a video on the Mexican revolution
Make a video about Jamaica
Yeaaaa that's right Canada
Yo can you do a oversimplified history of Prussia
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!! I’ve been waiting 8 months now for new videos I started watching the day the ww2 video came out and was still in high school when this came out and have loved your vids ever since. I was fine with the upload every 3 months schedule but now that you haven’t posted since 12/6/21 and haven’t seen a new video  this year it’s starting to get ridiculous (I’m writing this on 8/22/22) I get that the quality of the vids are improving but to be honest I would far rather have a video where the animations are slightly worse but having more videos than having a video once or twice a year and having the animations be top notch. Like if you agree and let’s try to get Oversimplified to upload more.  Edit: Don’t take this the wrong way I love Oversimplified’s videos and content and have for years so please don’t take this comment as a hate comment because I’m just trying to give him constructive criticism even though I was probably a little harsh also sorry this was a long comment.
3:41 that's a combat shotgun from Fallout 4
Ummm where you at man
i think the next video is about the vietnam war because at 5:02 it shows a map of vietnam on the table. been 8 months tho so its probably a big video
so thats how it is huh. thats how its gonna be is it thats the way in which things r eh that be how is it  will it be how that is huh that be the way in which things be the way they r is it
When the world needed him most, he vanished…
7:57 The part you came back for
Can you the yugoslavian war?

WE NEED THE BREAK UP OF YUGOSLAVIA OVERSIMPLIFIED
Wow. The editing around the pig dying and the flashbacks. Halarious! Hahaha
Can’t wait to see yet another video from this amazing channel. Whenever that’ll be.
WE wait untill your Return. Pls do the  Napoleon
where did oversimplified go
WHERE.IS.OVERSIMPLEFIED?!
''Amazing'' is just a gross adjective to describe how great OVERSIMPLIFIED is. There is simply no words to describe it correctly, only watch and enjoy his videos.
Why is there a war where no one died except the pig?
It’s been 8 months I can’t wait for the next video
i miss you can you comeback :((((((((
Day 41 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video

He is planning something…
Im not Canadian and im busting out laughing!!!
When is next video I like the channel and I sub but get no notifications from u
Remember kids, somewhere in an alternate universe you're taking tests on how a pig started war between Canada and the US. And probably not just one.
Wait so the war of 1812 is considered a draw despite The White House being reduced to ash and there being no American territorial gain?
Where have u been :(
I'm American, and the Island seems to be British to me... (And he was an idiot, AND was scheming. But he was making a stupid scheming.
Can everyone agree with me that OverSimplified is the best history YouTuber?
The Canadians arrested oversimplified because he hasn’t uploaded in so long
And we(Americans) gave the Germans $$$. Which might of funded the Prussian and world war... "Ah oh, uhh just scratch that"
When the thirteenth colonies ate that hamburger Florida is looking pretty sus

I think Canada should take over America. Like seriously, we could lead a better government, better education and a better health care system than US.
Guys, Oversimplified didn't use Nord VPN and got his data erased. That's why it's taking so long.
Come baaack
He simply disappeared... So sad... We'll miss you Oversimplified 😔
You know it's good when it's been 8 months
The wait is torture.
Jesus Christ please somebody call 911 this man is either having a heart attack taking a break from YouTube or he’s working on a bad ass video I don’t know how I could take nine motherfucking Months please you got me into history you’re my favorite YouTuber please just show proof that you’re not dead
It’s been 8 months without over simplified, I have severe hair loss and my skin is boiling, most of it fell off already. My vision is blurry and my fingers are trembling as typing this. I can’t walk without help and a doctor told me my blood sugar is way too low. Please save me
My history teacher played this at my middle school 6th grade…
Can you give a hint on your next video.
where are you dude
Do a Iran revolution
Give us the next video!
Theory: Oversimplified got arrested because of the speech
like my middle school band teacher always said and still probably does say, stupid people do stupid things
It's funny how, as someone who was born in Victoria and went through public school in south Vancouver Island, this is the most I learned about this struggle EVEN THOUGH my early highschool Social Studies/History classes were supposed to teach us students about this.   You can see the San Juan Islands from the east coast of Victoria...they're about 20 kms away. This history happened very close by, and yet all I remember from school was essentially: 'The British made Fort Victoria the capital of British Columbia so that the Americans wouldn't take the island during the Gold Rush.' Very mis-represented and over simplified.   But leave it to Oversimplified to make an informative and fun take on history that has been neglected by school curriculum. I mean...why even bother with listening during history class when a history youtuber can do a much better job? lol
Day 39 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
If he is keeping to his usual cycle then we might have a new video soon about a major war
Lol that ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣
8 months no new video.....wtf

Yo I’m in 5th grade and learning about Malala yousafzai  And well my teacher won’t let us watch oversimplified unless it’s pretty much about her  Sooooooo yeah

Can you at least say hi back? It's been a while.
Which song is the one that plays every time the Americans show up?
Why aren’t you uploading Any more?
Restraint, why does the dictionary even bother with a definition (in name only), because in the course of human history it has never been actually used, ever!!!🙏🤔😵‍💫
its my density! 🤣 anyone else notice that?
Every 6 months we need a banger.. we can’t get that ? Maybe when Covid over
5:00 anyone notice how there is a map of Vietnam War next to the American Negotiator?
Lmao that ending made me feel so patriotic 😂
bro its been 8 month please come back
Please invade Canada
Day 38 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
7:57  I didn't knew OverSimplified can spit fire.
Nothing cuter than watching shit like this that heavily insinuates that 1) its ONLY muh huuuwhyyytes that EVER settled/warred over land that wasn't initially theirs & 2) that the people they warred with didn't constantly war with _each other,_ in horrifying and brutal ways that made a musket blast look like a mercy kill. Did... Did you think that massive slaughtering of tribes, grapes of women, serious slävëry trade, etc ONLY happened once we got here?    🤣 mkay
Demand for new video 📉📉📉📉📉📉📉
Is this man still alive?
That manifest destiny scene has me dead
Dude its been 8months since the last upload
whens the next video
When does a new video come out? It's already been 8 months since you uploaded this one...
Literally this channel is why I got an A in world history
This video sums up USA foreign policy at any point in time. Step 1, put a bafoon in a position of power. Step 2, assume you own the world.
5:00 Look at the map on the left, it's Vietnam, THE VIETNAM WAR IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO.
Make video for history class 10

"I'd worry less about Canada's curves and more about your OWN curves, Benjamin"  - unnamed legend of history

Colossians 3:8  But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior, slander, and dirty language
Where u at man we need you came back
It is a new record for the longest time without an oversimplified upload. I do not know if we should celebrate or be scared.
Why ma man aint uploding, it’s hella sad
fun fact: if he's taking a long time making a video that means he's making A part two and a part one at the same time
Knock knock knock forgot us  oversimplified PWEASE (if it worked for holy roman emperor to get rid his opponents then it should be more than enough to work on you😂😂😂😁)give us a new video

5:19 Vietnam on the table
Let alone we do have the Strank‘s to defend ourselves let alone have a advantage
I highly don’t believe that America would invade Canada singers for a Canadian myself something would have to be really messed up for them to invade also knowing that we have like no nuclear warheads actually we do
Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire
He just got a Roman helmet decal in War Thunder so I’m gonna guess the Roman Civil War is his next video and it should be sometime in the near future

Hey lad, still waiting for the next video(s)
I came back to watch the ending, man turned into plankton.
I can't believe that it was 8 months ago
I just realized that manifest destiny (the belief that God wanted Americans to expand westward) is old-fashioned white supremacy. "We deserve this land because we're better than them!"
So when vietnam war
8 months since we've been graced with the brilliance of Oversimplified. So we know a banger of a video is coming soon!!!
Please post a video 😭
10:13

Hey, can you do a video on the war of 1812. I consider myself well versed in American history however all I know about the war of 1812 is the white house burned down and the battle of new Orleans that happened after the war was over.
Oversimplified accidentally created the Dark Brandon meme
the thumbnail is a star wars parody. anyone else see it?
Me starring at my screen waiting for him to post the Vietnam war video
10:32
The fact that a channel named "Oversimplified" gives me more information on these conflicts than school does-
Hmm, that one episode of Hey Arnold! makes way more sense now.
it should be video time
Hey man have not posted in a while i would love to see a punic wars video specifically the second one
Canadian informant:Umm,USA justified war against us.  Canadian prime minister: what was the reason?  Canadian informant: manifest destiny.  Prime minister: where did they get that idea?  Informant: Some white guy with a YouTube channel.

Inside news, Oversimplified is releasing a new video in 1 week

Can you make a video about these topics -  1. Bangladesh Liberation War  2. Vietnam War  3. African world war / 2nd congolese war
I can't believe you managed to get hold of the actual footage from inside the houses of Parliament!
Plz post
Sorry that’s not happening I’m in 2022 now so that didn’t happen
3:38 ah yes, it was America's *density*
"And I don't want to catch you using my computer, and selling my data to advertisers!" "Then, you my friend need, NordVPN!" "What the fu-"
pls upload again bro
I love how each videos is just a little less oversimplified
PLS KEEP MAKING VIDIEO'S SHEEP BE LIKE MEHHH
His next video is gonna be a movie
Man I’m hoping for a new video soon. This one was probably the greatest yet and they just keep getting better :)
Uhhh… he’s been gone for a while.
its been 8 months which means that hes uploading  soon
Jug Bidet's invasion of Canada will be the most interestjng/least catastrophic move he makes in his life
We need a update man its almost been a year since your last video
Bro where are you. It's been so long
Stop asking where OverSimplified is. He's planning the invasion of New Brunswick as we speak
He’s most likely not dead, just taking a break
its been 8th month and im sad
Ah I understand , this is how technoblade died
Dead channel?
He never took this long to make a video in all of these years Is he dead? Definitely
oversimplified havent posted on a very long time i am now worried
Is he fucking dead
We need more of your history
@oversimplified you should make a "The mexican revolution " episodes part 1 and part 2
*Me still waiting for a Vietnam war video
If Biden took Canada I'd change my stance on him from the worst president ever to an idiot that did one thing for America.
Well if ever there is a chance that US and Canada go into a war, native Americans (Indians) will have the last laugh I guess.
mmm smells like a 2 parter coming up
The only thing Biden is coming with is teleprompter
OverSimplified hasn't made a video for 8 months.    That means he's preparing a BIG project..
Pleasssseee uppppllloooooaaaddddd I luv ur videos
It's never been this long between uploads.... hope OS is ok
18:12
When is the next upload?
Day 32 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
RIP Oversimplified. You will be remembered in our hearts.
THE ENDING: 37:20
Pls upload again
I love your work on these videos keep up the good work my good sir
He haven’t uploaded in a while :(
ｐｐｐ＠＠＠＠＠＠＠ｐ
got to love that sneaky all star reverence.

The fact that they could have just went with the middle channel and the war wouldn't happen is just-
Can you do the wild west pls
When will you return my love ;-;
Daddy, can I please have some more content?
Oh look It's waddles 12:13
You know, an Old World Blues styled DLC about the Pig War for Red Dead Redemption wouldn’t be so bad.
It’s my density 3:38 @Oversimplified
MAKE A VID OF THE PHILIPPINE REVOLUTION
MAKE A VID OF THE PHILIPPINE REVOLUTION
MAKE A VID OF THE PHILIPPINE REVOLUTION
It’s been 8 months where’d you go? I wanna watch some new oversimplified

I’m sorry that I traded you for Jake Tran as my favorite YouTuber. Jakes a POS. Please come to back I was wrong andnI just can’t live without you, Oversimplified.
make a video about Reconstruction
Poor Captain Hunt…
You alive bro?
I really enjoy your videos
I bet Oversimplified is making a super long 2 part video that will release somewhat soon. And I am ready for it
whens the next video? (refferring to berlin wall)
We want more contentttt
Hey, so your map shown at 1:45  contains a spelling error.  The word "separating" is erroneously spelled "seperating."
Can y’all please stop complaining about how he hasn’t uploaded in 8 months? These take a lot of time and effort to make. He’s most likely working on something big. Just give it more time.
When balkan wars oversimplified
8 months since a video !! Plz post more!
boxer rebellion
guys nordvpn and honey have to keep advertising themselves on oversimplified's channel or else im gonna die
THE DAY OF THE RAKE APPROACHES
do console wars!!!!!!!!!!!!! it would be awesome please
Quit being assholes about him uploading y’all. Support him and be patient. These take a ton of time and effort.
Why aren't you uploading videos recently please give us video of Russian civil war and the Chinese revolution
Yay do it china revolution communist
I am hungry for more oversimplified videos. Please.
Day 31 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Loved the video! Could you please feature the Vietnam War at some point? These videos are great for educating my little siblings.
Bro it's been 8 months is this guy dead or something
Dude can you upload it’s been 8 months
Is it just me or is spuddy’s death the worst thing that has happened in the past 20 years
Oversimplified is like the guy who tried to parlay with the sheep, multi-lingual and half insane but always entertaining
why havent you posting
If I would have to make a Guess, I'd say he is working on a video about the revolutions of 1848
How do you get removed from the military in those days???
Romans 5:8 But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. Exodus 20:7 Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God, because the Lord will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses his name.
I NEED A NEW VIDEO-
It's been 8 months... WHERE ARE YOU OVERSIMPLIFIED
where are you
Can’t wait for the next oversimplified!
Please come back! everyone loves your work!
When the world needed him most he vanished
Thank fuck the plushies still being sold
The big what if for me is in regards to a British conflict breaking out simultaneously with the American Civil War.  We could be looking at a VERY different map today.
u gud bro???
1:24 greatest roast ever
I can’t wait for Vietnam *fortunate sun* plays  in the background
Bring out another video mannn
He died
pls post
Been a while since your last release.  If you're looking for a topic, how about the Chinese Civil War?  Given the rising tension lately between China and Taiwan, it could benefit people to know the history there.    Keep up the good work and thanks for the Nord VPN code.  I was already using them but managed to get some extra savings when my renewal came up.
Pls upload bro
It’s been 8 months and not another episode 😢
We miss you come back
Canada, more like Dumbada
already know his next video is gonna be a banger
Please do kosovo with serbia war
It’s now been 8 months since his disappearance by the 9th month im assuming he’s retired or dead
The part where he said the border could look like "this or this" around 27:27 is hilarious ... just shows how ridiculous the whole thing was.  Also ... watch out Canada
31:47 al capig
Oh so angry birds
Bro this is the best video from oversimplified
I get kinda annoyed by how you use the LOL face instead of the fuuuuuuuuuuuu
@oversimplified where did you go? We need you.

His absence could mean one of two things 1. He’s dead 2.He’s cooking up something big
Oversimplified, where are you?? I miss your videos. I need more😭

Alright guys only 3 more years till the next one

Just goes to show that the brits are just more civilised 😂
currently imagining an 1.50 hour kong video on something like the interwar period or the 7 years war due to it being 8 months since his last one
33:29 best part of my life
I did not expect that ending
NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COME NACK TO US GET BACK HERE PLEASEEE

Please come back soon Oversimplified. I love your videos. I always get excited when I see a new video of yours.
27:29 what to you mean
My guy it’s been 8 months come back to us!
Well what was the British Hawaiian Constable armed with a Hawaiian war club
So a foreigner tried to claim they had some kind of authority over an American and an American response by pulling two pistols and a big knife makes you proud to be an American I tell you what
I think this channel is already DEAD 😔
It’s been 8 months I think it’s about time for a new one
BRUH THAT LAST PART😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video went from informative to insanity and gay porn   I feel like patchy the pirate in that one episode
I like at the end his American in stinks stared to show.
Man, your new video must be really long if you have been working on it for 8 months.
I know a lot about this cause I live in Washington state on the south west side of it and we had to learn about this in Washington state history
Also can you do the ww3 2087-2096 , you know,the one with nukes
where is the new video :(
How slow can a youtuber be when it comes to uploads? Well, I think this guy just broke the record.
Me: *wanting new video* Oversimplified: *uploads video* Me 39 minutes later: *wanting new video*
Do hate Canada??
Day 29 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
I learned more about Canadian history from this video than 12 years of Canadian public education. That is both a compliment to your video and an insult to the Canadian public education system
Amazing what isn't taught in American history. Never would have known about this gem of a story without this channel.  Love your work, dude! Hope you are well. 💥
It’s been 8 months daddy we really really miss you  Mommy said you don’t upload every month like Other YouTuber  Mommy makes me watch KSI  Oh I got to go now  Bye daddy
Can you cover the Mexican-American war please 🙏 🙂
Oversimplified where Vietnam war
Biden couldn’t find his ass with both hands and a map. An invasion of Canada with him in charge would be worse the the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.
UwU
Being American they pulled guns on them”.  That sounds accurate
Oversimplified, it would make a massive honor of me and my country if you do the Albanian - Ottoman Wars 1432 - 1479 PLSS
Hey, its been 8 months :( Please bless us with a new video :)
Omg goood video bro man 👨 canada
um
where is Vitenam war?
Next video
Waiting here until oversimplified episode on Vietnam comes out
31:00 I laughed so hard 🤣 😂
I think the americans own the islands
Where are you bro
Can you tell us when are you going to release a video?
Don't let the funi 8 become a 10 or.. I'll..... Uh do nothing? What were you expecting? not like I can do anything but I hope it's in it's final stages
Can you do indonesia revolution war,please ?

The next video should be good because it’s taking longer then his usually ones, or he’s having a burn out
Next video must be due any day now
hello? are you alright @oversimplified its been 8 mounths and i cant read
Dude this was fuckin awesome
I’m guessing the next video is going to be big since it’s been 8 months
Do the war of the five kings
Where's that new video guys? Usually it's only about a 3 month gap
For Ukraine please make the history of Holodomor shine light on the other horrific events they went through.
I'm guessing he is taking a break
hold on, where uploads, the quality jump was pretty big from the previous video, but 8 months is a bit much right? is there just no wars to cover?
Vietnam in on the map? 2:55
😳wtf
Where go you? :(
Where are you Oversimplified 😭😭😭
where have you been it’s been 8 months come back and make a video about the american invasion of canada
im english and am deeply woried about your mind for the last few minits, the flag will change for the extra states and "its not out of the question that you have a very minor case of serious brain damage" wheatly from portal 2 20xx
Hey idk if you read comments this late but I think you should make a video about how feudalism works
America can’t invade Canada because they’re both part of NATO
30 Years war - Oversimplified? -  it REALLY needs oversimplifying
“Lyman shot the pig” is the greatest sentence ever
I keep watching this over and over again and every time I like it more
When is he gonna upload again 😭😭😭
Embrace Jesus Christ the lord and savior
I cried when the pig died
Who wants OverSimplified As Your Maths And Science Teacher? 👇👇
lmao why did you stop making videos i enjoyed them
Do sengoku era japan
So. this all started because of a man killing a pig because of eating the potato plants. so he shot it so it can die. Then the guy who shot the pig was gonna get arested. But this one doofy general who fought during Mexican war. He decided to turn that into a war? Wow.
Day 28 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
This video reminds me of gravity falls for some reason.
um he hasn't posted in 8 mouths..
Upload Something or i will upload something
The channel that they said is whatever channel they want
Can you do the vietnam war

I need my oversimplified fix! I’ve been checking everyday! But I know it’s gonna be good so I’ma chill
Do a 100 years war one plzzzzz
We love all your videos. My 7-year-old has been binge watching them, especially the ones about ww1 and ww2. Maybe you could make a video about the Mexican American war?
12:52 Timestamp for whenever I come back to this video to see this part.
620
White or part of the european union including spain or france sounds odd
anyone else notice at 2:58 there is a map of the Vietnam war in his format? foreshadowing anyone???
do a video about the mexican american war
If they had landed, it would’ve saved millions of lives. Why?, because Pickett wouldn’t have screwed up so much of the civil war.
Do a Vietnam video
Oh no biden's coming to trip and fall.
If you seeking for a video idea you should make videos aboute the greek revolution 1821
8 MONTHS, man we do not even know if you are still alive
8 months
5:20 on the table, thats vietnam on a map, this means vietnam war coming soon?
Wow oversimplified, you sure do make up great plans. Just make sure you head doesn’t get to big!
Also Day 45 Of watching pig war until oversimplified releases his next vid(The Vietnam War)
Calm down, dude
Do the 911 attack   Afghanistan
Day 27 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
"AND THERES NO WAY IM EVER GOING TO AGREE TO IT!" Ah yes, an American pulls out a Soviet AK nearly 150 years before it was invented. Makes sense to me.
You should do a vid about either the bosnia or Kosovo war
heyy i would love if you could make a video about the founding of the german empire maybe including the 1848 revolution   i love your videos and i think that would be a really interesting topic <3
not really a history kid, but for u i’ll watch it again and again
8 months 😢
Bro when will a new one come from u
طولت الغيبة يا كبير
This is just a suggestion, but plllleeeeaaasssseeee make a video about China and Mao Zedong, that would be insanely cool, not doing so, in my opinion. Uncool
8 months have passed and no new video I could wait for few more weeks if you guarantee a high quality video Thats sounds like a fair compromise that will protect the interest of both parties.  And there is no way in I am agreeing to it 😠
He might be doing Vietnam next
"being americans, they pulled out guns"😂😂😂
It’s been 8 months you ok?
Wait did y'all realize the Vietnamese map?
halo, are you making new video? if yes, pls inform us since everyone has been waiting you for 8 months...
I love your history
Yeah… this wasn’t politically charged at all!🙄
Yo OverSimplified I’m just checking up on ya. Are you good? You haven’t posted for 4 months… Did you run out of content?
New videooo
Mans uploading once a year and Im still waiting 😢
Oversimplified might be in custody
I'm calling it, next uploads are going to be the Vietnam War
16:00 ON THE TABLE! THERES A VIETNAM MAP ON IT! SECRET ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE VIETNAM WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Would you make a video about the iraq war
Hey over simplified can you do the edsa people power revolution and battle of yultong i think you filipino views would love it

3:37 america it sure is your “density”
Where are you, old friend? We miss you

Eight months no new video there’s gonna be a tax for that
The end was fucking hilarious
Today, 8th of August 2022. It has been 8 months since Oversimplified has uploaded. I am beginning to lose faith.
Are you still making videos or just doing nothing and stoped  making videos
When is his vid coming out
*It's been 8 months*  *Oversimplified has never took this long ever to make a video*
Day 26 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Do the war f the five kings
Pet peeve of mine is the 'theyre not white people!' comment. Its not like beingthe same race stopped the revolutionary war or the french-indian war.
To be honest. You was much better: better upload schedule (2-4 months), videos are actually oversimplified. But now just look at the upload schedule, it's taking from a half to almost 1 year. And this Pig war in fact should be a Mini War with short length instead of nearly 40 minutes even longer than WW2. This is the opposite of oversimplified it's overcomplicated
Best video ever
sus
Can you do the panamainian flag crisis 1964 because my papa took Down the flag and I could give you info
@Toast6 your picture is so cute
How about for the next oversimplified be about either Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great for a two part episode?
Can you do: The Zulu War The Vietnam War The Mexican American War The Spanish American War The Gilded Age The Crusades Símon Bolivar and Gran Columbia The Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci, The Paraguay War The Reconstruction Period The Civil Rights Movement, Malcolm X, MLK, Rosa Parks Jone of Arc and the hundred Years War The Colonial Age The Utah Wars The Seminole War The Progressive Movement, Feminism, Populism, Eugenics :(,  The Great Depression, Huey Long,
People who wants to end the Ukraine Russia war for peace While me who is waiting for the war to end so over simplify making a video about it
pls post more
Love im video 2021
the ending was insane🤣🤣
RELEASE A NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!
can i collab with you? i'm great at the people you animate
where r u?? Come backkkkk!
He’s gone for good why?
Hey man why don't you stop punishing us severely and make a new video
When r u gonna post again
This video is filled with so much cringeworthy vitriol towards America and Americans.
Something about Oversimplified's descent into madness gets me everytime.
TLDR: We ought to be a bit more humble and look for the ways we are inconsistent in our own actions, instead of just doing the lazy attack on bad people in the past.  You know, the most common thing people say when looking at history (especially western history in the last 500 years), the easiest and laziest thing to do is point at those people and say "How didn't they realize how bigoted and hypocritical they were? It's so clear to us, here and now, so far removed from the culture and context they lived in." It's almost like we think they existed in a society that had the same ideas about human & civil rights that we do, and they just chose to ignore it out of selfishness, greed, and good old-fashioned pure EVIL™. There were definitely elements of that, but for the most part the aggressive racist hypocrisy of the past was economically, culturally, and legally reinforced in social consciousness. With the exception of VERY few people, they didn't take a hard look at themselves to consider whether these actions were inconsistent with their own morals.  And why would they? WE, TODAY, DON'T DO THIS EITHER. Sure, we point out moral problems in larger society, but we don't search for a possible cause in ourselves. No, we blame and attack other people. Everyone from every political affiliation at every point in history does this, and we should not fool ourselves into believing that we have improved that much. Maybe some God damn humility and introspection would do us some good.  ***In case it must be said, this is NOT to justify acts of cruelty, bigotry, and oppression—past or present. My only point is to demonstrate that we should be more aware of how easy it is to fall into the same cognitive dissonance that tyrants and oppressors use to justify themselves.***
def do the 100 years war
Upload pls
Bro, upload
you are crazy, oversimplefied.
28:10 best moment

Day 25 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Do Afghanistan war
I’m ready for more content!
If you really want to make it up to Canadians do a video of us burning down the white house in the war of 1812
Oversimplified hasn’t uploaded a video in more than half a year. This enraged his followers, who punished him severely.
It’s rare to see a sailor being classified as higher intelligence than a general a captain and a farmer combined. Man I guess Americans are built different
When will you be making another of your awesome videos?
Ending was great
Noooooo i wanted to see the mole
Still waiting….
Does anyone know when a new episode will be released?
Eh Canada burnt the white house you hoser 🍁

Can't wait for Vietnam War to come out!
You should do a Korean war video

Also when are you done with a new video
37:00 to 38:20  Say that again and You're Screwed.
Where's your next video?
According to cannibals, eyes are the most delicious part of a human, so the fact the customs inspector wanted to eat people's eyes is accurate
Has it really been 7 months 😭😭😭😭😭
Here's some wars you could do 1. Zulu war 2. Korean war 3. War on Terror 4. Trojan War (just dont mistake the trojan for the other trojan) ;) 5. The Punic wars 6. Hundred years war   Anyways thats all
Bro is dead
4:52  look at the map on the table sideways its Vietnam OVERSIMPLIFIED VIETNAM
guys this is fake the war of 1812 was CGI
37:08-38:22 Funny thing is since Canada is in NATO just like the US, if the US invaded Canada or even just slightly attacked Canada, every country in NATO would kick America out of NATO and they would immediately gang up on America: France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain e.t.c. (maybe even Russia, due to a valid excuse) they would all invade the US
Why does the pig sound like morgan freeman
I have a question.  What if Pickett had one or two brain cells left and hid in the woods?  What then?
No one wants to invade Canada.  All those Floridians and Texans would arrive in Winnipeg in September and go, "I didn't even know it could get this cold!" when its only -10 C /15 F, while all the Manitobans reply, "Wait a few months," knowing that the windchill hits -40 F and C every year.  It's Germany vs Russia in WW2 all over again, except some of the invaders are from tropical climates.  Oversimplified could also look at the times americans have invaded the Canadian colonies.  The invasion of Montreal during the American rebellion, the War of 1812 (each side sacked the other side's leader's home), and the Fenian raid after the American Civil War.
Gravity Falls: Season 3 The Waddles War
14:00
33:25 got me laughing
I want more videos
Hey you know  8:45 in the video you an see a map of Vietnam in the left on the table
Too much infestation of them glubby ones already.  GRRRRR
Day 23 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
I've been seeing many clues around oversimplified videos the next video or a future one is Vietnam you can hide from me as I will search throughout ever video event the Vietnam one and I'm confident.
33:08 OMG IS THAT HITLER?
Now I'm scared. Hope he is safe 😕
10:23
That was an epic Segway to the nord ad
L
P
Why do you starve us of your content  We need more
If you've run out of the history of white folk can you do some videos of important events that  happened in non-white nations?
Nobody going to talk about Morgan freeman pig?
Yes the ford mustang is American but the Mini Cooper is actually german
Where is the fucking uploads
Anyone see the map of Vietnam at 8:43 or am I crazy
wHaRE did he go I miss monthly uploads
Where are the new videos man
Imagine if the american canadian war happened and oversimplified made a video about it and said "The americans are just about to reach ottawa. And its all over. But then it got cold.              Stupid cold."
Next year: The Youtube War
I wonder when he will post a new video
Y'all can take Canada as you like . just .. Leave Quebec Alone , we'll do fine without the rest of Canada .
If over simplified makes a private army to invade Canada, I’m in. Not sure if I’ll be very helpful but I’m in god damn it!
Bro drop a vid
Look at the table to the left at 5:02
Imagine his school presentations
He got his spotted AAAA

reason why United states don't attack Canada sure we may not have nukes but we have NATO and if america attacked Canada america would also have to fight United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Albania, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, Romania, Germany, Slovakia, Greece, Slovenia, Hungary, Spain, Turkey, etc so go ahead and attack see how it ends plus Canada has never lost a war have a nice day now:)
Creepin up on 8 months oversimplified
It’s weird, every time OverSimplified uploads it is after a sad event that heavily effects me that lifts me up from the sad event. I want a new vid so badly to lift up my spirits. After another event that happened  😭

I need my fix bro
This is his best one yet. Gonna be hard to top. Maybe that's why it's taking so long.
Charlie Hopkinson: “Voice of the Pig”. 😀😀😀😀 I would almost guarantee that retention of facts about history would increase ten fold if these videos were simply played to students just once in schools during history classes.
I think he forgot he had a YouTube channel
“ I heard it was Sharon’s cat” “ I hear voices all the time”
WHEN IS THE NEXT VID

Are you okay dude, you haven't posted anything on here or patreon in a while
Thank you for making these. Not only have you saved my grades in History classes for my diploma, but you also gave me something interesting and funny to listen to while playing animal crossing.
Hey guys, I think the next video may or may not be the Vietnam war. Everyone has been asking, he has not been uploading for a while (meaning it’s a big project) and he gave a hint! Go to 15:45 and on the bottom left side of the room there is a table with a map of southeast Asia, with south Vietnam highlighted blue and North Vietnam China highlighted red. This is probably a teaser, but it also looks like the north could be highlighted blue from the angle but idk!
bro what next? the toyota war? my man officially ran out of content
Starting to thing oversimplified went out to get cigarettes 😢
It’s been a while since your last video, we need something new😂!
Do the potato war oversimplified.
Oversimplified has been gone for 7 months… Dude, uncool
He’s dead I think
Make a video of AUGUSTUS! He is almost as cool as Napoleon Bonaparte. Well nooo he is cooler!
Come on Vietnam War Part 1 & 2!!!!  I would also love to see a departure from the war theme for a "Roman Empire - Oversimplified."  Too bad it would take a year.
Ok, I am going to stop looking for the next Oversimplified video and then it will surely show up.... 12 days later.... dude... uncool...

This should have been a movie 🍿 🎥
Oversimplified pls do all revolutions
Where is the Overweight Stick Figure, when you need him?
Its been 7 months where is the new video uggggh
Pls do Hamilton
Some ideas for the next oversimplified video 1. Chinese revolution (since he already drew Mao in a past video). 2. Russian civil war (he said he would make a video on it in the Russian revolution video). 3. Vietnam war 4. Korean war 5. Meiji restoration 6. Crusades (Don't know much about it so it would be useful). 7. Hundred year war (Same as the Crusades). 8. 7 years war (WW0) 9. Mongol conquests 10. Balkan wars 11. European colonization  12. The Great depression (also not listing stuff like the breakup of yugoslavia because it would probably be demonitized).
Where are you

I am Indian

I'm a guy that loves history and learning about it. The way you put this together was absolutely fantastic and I will probably always remember what happened in this moment in history just because of this video. I am certainly subscribing to you with the bell. I'm going to watch more of your stuff too this is great 😂
Day 4 of asking for the Mexican - American war.
Biden is currently coming with a dementia.
Dude the ending is so terrifying ahahah, sleep with one eye open canada

Why so racist?
It's funny how the US always saw themselves as the anti-imperialists

Thinking about country flags being used as lightsabers is a cool yet interesting idea.  Star Wars: The Pig Wars
Hey oversimplified! Something about India?

Make a video about the war on terror
Where are you?   Oversimplified Kenobi, you're my only hope.
Day 13 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
There should be an Oversimplified about the Civil Rights Movement, what it took to get there, what were the roadblocks in the way of desegregation, and the ideas and examples we use today for racial rights. I know this could span hundreds of years from the founding of the Colonies to the Lyndon Johnson Presidency... but it could bring awareness of that is HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR DAMN LEGISLATION TO SET UP EQUAL RIGHTS! Yes, we ended slavery in the Civil War, we gave African Americans the ballot in The Reconstruction (spoiler, not really),  but we only bothered to listen to plight to gain African American workers and soldiers during World War F**king Two! The time we ever give all African Americans the ballot for real is with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a year after the Civil Rights Bill of 1964! Even the World was making fun of the USA by nation politicians mocking US delegation with civil rights questions when they try diplomacy to non-white countries like India and Africa.  All I'm trying to say, is that we came an embarrassingly long way to finally give equality a chance, and it is still a fight to this day. I think going over The Civil Rights Movement will be not only informative, but also entertaining of how this country fumbles of how the legislation constitutes 'freedom' with 'all men'.
We need BRITISH INDIA COLONISATIONNNN
Hey I know this is a long shot but could you do the English civil war as one of your next videos please thanks
one question: do you have a PREDICTION when your next vid's coming out?? i really would like to know
you should make a video called the poop wars about how the spanish and the americans were trying to conquer the islands off the coat of south america that had bird poop on it
“Where did he go when we needed him the most”
make more videos please you teach me history
5:56  Me when I saw the Moroccan Sahara included within Mauritania instead of Morocco "in the NordVPN map 6:06"

I feel the next one is going to be a hit
The Pig War in History: America vs Canada The Pig War in the modern world: Technoblade fans vs a random nerd saying Techno deserved death

It’s time for the first of our bi annual oversimplified video
Imma wait for new oversimplified video
You could do The Peloponnesian war. It would be so fun and educating to see this kind of video!
he should make a video about the english civil war since its barely ever talked about
Sounds like something I had started a war over on my Minecraft server not gonna lie XD
I absolutely cannot wait to see what hes been working on next, I love these so much.
I hope oversimplified is okay, it’s been a long time since he last uploaded
Please say there is a General Harney plushy!   He’s my 3x grandfather (not proud), but think this story reinforces how much of a hothead and how unfitting he was to be in a position with such authority.
Am I the only one that wishes there was  slightly less jokey/comedy material and a little bit more history content? Still love these but some of the jokes are just…meh.
Bro are you okay, you haven't uploaded for half a year
Why per video you upload it takes longer and longer to upload the next one. like you uploaded so often before
i love your vids but why you take so much time
Time flies by...
Rip channel for real.
the harney scream was beautiful
Hey, Oversimplified! I'm Mexican, but I was raised in America, and I was wondering if you could make a video about the Mexican war of Independence or the Mexican revolution. Thanks!
More.  More.  More.  MORE.
Canada 🇨🇦 🍁 🇨🇦 🍁 🇨🇦  please

Day 11 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Do a Dutch empire video next

For people who wonder why it takes so long for a new video. This guy has 1610 donators on patreon. So, he has no rush to do anything since he earns a good income each month. Getting rich by doing nothing. Plus he gets around the 20k a month by just keeping these video's online.
When will he make a video about winter war.
This video just sounds like something an american will do
We need another video… please

Try oversimplified Indonesian history
there is no empire of germany, only the GERMAN EMPIRE the only of empire we had was the Holy roman empire of german nation, still making reference to the dominating population not the region
Oversimplified is the only channel with a sense of humor.

Am I the only one who heard all star

Just noticed that the custom's officer looks like their Representative Brooks from the American Civil War Pt. 1 vid but the officer has black hair and Brooks in the pt 1 vid had brown hair. I guess that would explain his craziness huh.
VIETNAM WAR
OMG I just now noticed the thumbnail is a parody of a Star Wars poster.

You wouldn't invade canada we are alies... also that would be a world war.
If oversimplified posted regularly he would have at least 9 mill subs
Anyone know the name of the song at 7:30?
I’m missing you.
Day 7 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
I think oversimplified is waiting for WW3

"Could the US invade Canada?"  America's such a shithole that Quebec would actually be an upgrade. Go for it.
10:24

I wish he still made videos, I really like them.
This is the funniest video oversimplified has ever released
7:57 anyone got reminded of this?
Boring history explained in a very funny way. Well done!
He will return soon
This story is clearly fake. Everyone knows Canada isn’t real.
Is this channel dead?
Nice
When it takes longer than 6 months for him to upload, you know its gonna be good
I couldn't imagine the USA invading Canada our countries are basically BFFs.
Where are you gone man? You need to do more videos great content. You should do Irish/ English history 😁
Bro 7 months??? The wait time is killing me.
Over 7 months now since the last one. I think it’s a wrap guys looks like he’s had enough 😭
Pls make a new video of the cod wars
IK your videos probably take a while to make but it's been months we're are you bro just make a sort vid saying that your alr and if your taking a break or not
Well, Canada can keep Canada how bout that.

Where ru
Can you do an oversimplification of the 9/11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan?
I just noticed that I never got any notifications from your videos in the last year. What’s up YouTube? Well, I have a few videos to catch up on.
It's been 7 months
Looks like I’m super late to the party. Almost 7 mil subs. But I’ve laughed super hard over the last 2 day binge of this channel. And bravo

What happened to over simplified? Also rip technoblade
I hate your fucking videos
Do the ukreanien war when is going to end
Like if he should do all 3 English Civil Wars
Why does every good channel refuse to post consistently
Why are so many people so desperate for a new oversimplified video? Yeah, they're good, but it isn't the life force of anyone
come back :(
Oversimplified please upload more! Don’t be pressured, if something Is going on it’s fine, just don’t upload. But if nothing is happening, please upload a new video.
so......whens that vietnam war video coming?
wish all of these channels would just cut all the shit humor, would be so much better.
technoblade :(((( rest in peace
Make more videos
When is next vid haven’t uploaded in 7 months?
4:11 very VERY accurate oversimplified 🤣🤣
LOVELY 💚💟💚💟💟💚
Wait, pls tell me this is not the last Oversimplifird video 😥
Hey OverSimplefied your prob not even seeing this but,, can i use your art style for my channel. Your art style is just really good.
Legends say that OverSimplified hasn't posted much because, after his speech at the end, he was taken by the canadian goverment.
1:15 is the best roast I’ve ever heard…
It's been 7 months, whens the next video coming?
Can you please post a new video
Day 4 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Its been 7 months!!! He's supposed to upload every SIX months!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Do bosnia war pls
I gotta wonder, is this guy anti-American, anti-white because he paints history as negatively as possible for whites as he can.
How this one YouTube video almost started ww3
7:57 S R E K
Can you pls make *The Mongol Conquest*
We haven't hear from Oversimplified since this video. Probably he got arrested because of the threats to provoque a war against Canada. Edit: He managed to escape.
The next video has to be coming out soon. It normally takes 6 months for him to upload a new one, plus the next one will most likely be a 2 part series. Probably just taking a little more time to get both videos ready
This is why I love YouTube.
15:54 on one of the tables there is a photo of vietnam THE NEXT VIDEO IS THE VIETNAM WAR %100
You alive? Haven't posted in almost a year. Hopefully you can make one about the Russian and Ukrainian conflict.
The world needs you back making a video every three months.
i miss you
When are u going to post a vid,miss ur vid broo
I want a general Lee plushy
I wonder what’s next!! Probably the Vietnam War
i think he died 😭
Where you at?
OK SO I totally understand it takes time and effort to make these videos and I'll wait patiently for it, but I'm more concerned that he hasn't been seen or heard on the internet since early February, like even he hasn't posted on Patreon since then
Unification of Germany Please?
Just a pig? Dude, that was like his dog.
Are you okay
God I love this channel.
“But the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming, Hopped in they’re wagons and they hit the ground running” - Oversimplified Quotes
the ending made me feel so many new emotions at once
When the world needed him most he vanished.

You alive?
“I I didn’t say they were white people… “ 😂😂💀😂

Bro, where is the next video?
Been over half a year please post
He’s definitely working on the Vietnam war
Another case of men being irrational and emotional throughout history 😂
He’s been gone since December. And it’s July now. I think he’s been working on a massive project.
16:00 Glad to see Oversimplified is working on a Vietnam video
The head of stray
Still waiting for a new video
Trying to guess when the northVPN add comes
For ze Channel part its the dang Middle due to me knowing how dumb the people were due to it say  "the Middle of said channel"  in which it was saying it was the middle one due to tons of reasons that the people back then did not know and were to, were greedy.
ANOTHER VIDEO WHEN
Well I guess he died. May he rest in peace🙏

17M views about a Pig War. Education isn’t dead, we just need the right people to tell us about it.
Make videos every month
You know, last time you tried to invade us your stupid White House got burnt to the ground. Imagine what we can do with modern technology
13:21 Such a hysterical bit, well done. Had me in stitches for a solid 5 minutes.
I just realized the mistake on destiny as DENSITY 😂😂😂
Make new video b itch
But the islands are for the british and not for the americans
I think britain has it
100% down to invade Canada. I wanna fight on the Montana front.
TDIL Americans love shooting people. Just kidding, everyone knows that.  Gonna go clean my AR15 now.
I want a new video already!!!!
"These white people sure love beavers."
Can you please make a video about the "Great Northern war". Would mean the world to me if you could. Love from Norway🇧🇻❤️.
Anyone think he should have a discord server
I suggest you do a video on the vietnam war and Genghis Khan.
I love the thought of OverSimplified joining forces with Norm the Genie and TomSka to finally deal with Canada once and for all
You should do the Lincoln County War in the future
Yo this is good
We'll fuck you up this time just like the last.
Haha Wayne greatzsky wavering the American flag
plz upload
U can make balkan wars
Yo where are vids?
Yo it's been 7 months, yall slacking. We all waiting on the next video.
the canadians are mad now
Do the plague
Rip technoblade
When are you going to post new content? It's been 7 months and I think I've binged the whole channel multiple times
33:05
32:44
19:45 i looked it up $100 then is  $3,521.64 now so yeah extremely unreasonable
the part about annexing canada reminds me of fallout because i guess canada became corrupt because i'm assuming the canadians sided with china and china had invaded alaska and was killing innocent people and canada wouldnt let the Americans through so the us government just annexed all of canada and replaced with a bunch of new us states
Day 2 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
Fabulous CanCon.  I was born on the so called American side of the settler border, but grew up on Vancouver Island, below the 49th parallel. I don't think the US should invade Canada. I think Cascadia (basically Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia) should separate from Canada and the United States. We already have our own flag and anthem.
when next vid
Video idea:Yugoslavia oversimpified
DONT TURN ME INTO A PLUSHY NOOOOOOOO
37:45 Why Egyptian eagle on the flagpole?
where
you’re due for an upload
I think oversimplified guy die
I feel like he’s a school fun history teacher that makes his class fun and funny
American expansion or reconstruction please
getting worried that oversimplified disappeared
WHENS THE NEXT VIDEO DROPPING !?
That moment when you don't know how to end a video
What took so long to upload
Bro died
I love your videos
does anyone know the name of the song at 7:24 and 16:27?
Sadly, if we've EVER had a president who would invade Canada thinking they were hostile to the US.....it's definitely Biden.
Day 1 of me rewatching The Pig War - Oversimplified until he returns with another video
When are you going to do the Vietnam war
You should do the Portuguese Indian War next
lmao i heard that all star lyrics on 8:00  😂
i'd love a video about stalin or napoleon like you did with hitler and henry the 8th
When is your next video coming out? I really wish the edited and creating process of these videos could be faster because your videos are very entertaining. My 7th-grade history teacher would put on your videos when she forgot to make a lesson plan, so thank you.
Russian Civil War please 🙏
Dang it he got me again with the ad
another dead youtuber ;(
Ahh british soldiers, just gang bangs and flag pole theft.
He's been on a 7 month hiatus, hope this project is going well!
Can you please oversimplify the 100 years war?
Any more videos coming soon
What edit software do u use?
Nxt video plzzzz
you dead?
Now talk about pablo escobar
That line at Walmart ain’t no joke.
iheard a rap🤣
😂 Bring it US! There is a part of me that wants a re mach so when we burn down the white house some politicians half way round the world don't just call it a draw, and another that is oddly okay with Canada just joining the United States... or we can remain at boring peace I suppose.
OK OVERSIMPLIFIED I THINK YOU CAN POST THE NEW VIDEO NOW
Here are events I want Oversimplified to focus on: War of 1812 30 years war Roman Empire 7 years war Russian Civil War Vietnam War Korean War Spanish conquest of the Americas
Man sure don't talk enough about Canada in his videos.
Here are some future video suggestions for Oversimplified: Mongol Empire,  Genghis Khan, The Silk Road, The Bubonic plague or black death, Korean war, Vietnam war, American invasion of Grenada, War of 1812, Mongol invasions of medieval Japan, and etc.
PLEASE COME BACK BABE I MISS YOUR VIDEOS
Please please please come out with a new video bro. I love them. I’m a big history guy and it makes history way easier to understand and it’s hilarious. Plus I give u probs on how accurate things are like in the civil war videos u changed the confederate flag as they changed it during the war. PLEASE RELEASE ONE SOON BRO

Charles: I’ll Have you Know that you an American are currently trespassing on BRITISH Territory! American Collector: (Splutters) Both baa at Each Other
13:07 Talking to sheep

I’d love it it Oversimplified covered the greatest conflict of all time! The whiskey war of Hans-island! Brutally fought between Canada and Denmark over control of the most important and influential island in North America! Their methods of fighting…  …Whiskey
New video pleaseeeee
The one pig that died is technoblade 😥😔😟
Every one in YouTube be like “I know I’m fifty three thousand but FIRST”
My favorite Scenes:  (straight line 1:55) (straight line 2 2:57) (yes truly British 7:22) ( noooo 1. 7:25)  (ye haw 1. 8:49) ( LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE 12:22) ( noooo 2.16:28) (Scheme mode 21:22) ( BLOWN TO BITS RUN!!!! 26:03) ( BUCHANAN 1 28:44) (BUCHANAN 2 29:18) (Alright you psychopath 33:29) (yee haw 2 36:04)
Oversimplified of the history, what is your wisdom?
DO A VIDEO ON THE WAR OF 1812 BECAUSE IT WAS NOT "BASICALLY A DRAW" CANADA WON :)
Where did you go?
Where are u man it’s been 7 months (at the time of writing this)
no video in 7 months? you already know this next one is gonna be a banger

Yea let's take Canada
Oh no he is trigging a war with canada in a video

I think I'm turning Canadian. Everytime the two side discussed about how the borders should be, I always agreed with the British' compromise. Like, seriously, straight line through a river? Fuck that. Dumb asf borderline
Come back
last part of video is the best
FYI.  Native Americans were some of the largest slave owners in the south.
He lost it at the end lol
ITS BEEN 7 MONTHS GIMME NEW VID

Rip technoblade
inpopular opinion: oversimplified should sacrifice some quality to publish more often and prevent burnout from working too much
Can you please make the Vietnam war

I already feel mistreated as a québécoise in Canada but in the Sates I would probably not even be able to call myself québécoise. Already scared for when they’ll come for our water and colder temperature as the earth temperature rise up.  But I’m still american as I live in america, so I truly don’t understand why you called the US citizen americans like they are the only people living in America.
Bruh you didn’t talk about Canada enough
I love how it take him speaking out against Canadians to raise his voice this high
It's about that time....
Still waiting on the Vietnam war

YOUTUBE NEEDS YOU-  YOU MUST MAKE YOUTUBE GREAT AGAIN       (yes that was a reference)         please man--- im dying waiting for another video XDDD   Sincerely, a devote onlooker.
0:46  "I didn't say they were white people!"  I think we all know where this is going.
He should do war of 1812
I’m dying of not getting a new video😭😭😭
The way he talked sounded like he was hinting at a massive invasion
I just noticed at 5:10, you can see the map of the Vietnam War on the table. Foreshadowing to the next video???
If The USA go into Canada, Canada will FIGHT OverSimplified get out of my face you
When upload day 2
Hey Oversimplified! I kinda missed you!
Woooooooooo! You cant say anything you want to you know people have different religions you know
The USA sure looks small back then
Hey oversimplified, the one thing that you can never simplify is earth in 2022
why does he have a feeling of invading Canada?
I mean, it seems like that could’ve been a distraction for the union considering they’d be also at war with the British, which makes the confederate plan of just holding out make more sense
video idea  Sri Lankan civil war  Indian Independence
How mucho more we have to wait?
please make new video
Oversimplified is basically the definition of quality over quantity.
Just a recommendation but maybe making a remake of the WW1 video may be nice
Can you post more videos? I’m bored

PLEASE POST AGAIN

I can't hear the All Stars reference without the music
Nobody’s talking about the sick intro and thumbnail…
I beg you to upload something
No new video yet? Uncool
@OverSimplified when’s the next video
The Haitian Revolution would be a good choice being the first successful slave rebellion. Or a video about the Scramble For Africa.
This is a masterpiece
Oversimplified can you make a video about the Vietnam war? I think it would be fun
be there soon
stop procrastinating. its been 6 months.

I really think America was being greedy just give them the islands
First, if this war actually started, then it would probably be ww1, second, as a Canadian I thought it was hilarious that you forgot one little detail about Canada in the end of the video, a little Canadian tradition mostly forgotten, a tradition that gives us a huge advantage over anyone in battle. ( back in the day we were basically new Sparta, and we still are)
I’m sure those Canadians would love some 2nd amendment right now
how to make history fun:
Any time now..
Outtrow  is offensive to Canadian  Bescuse am Canadian
No joke, I do wanna conquer Canada
7:41 uh oh... that's a lot of bodily kinda-liquids

Stop complaining that it's taking too long for a video to come out, give the man some time and stop suggesting ideas as it appears that the Vietnam War  was chosen
Oversimplified is a underrated channel but they post a vid every 6 months and thats a bad thing so i would really appreciate if you start making vids more often,keep up the good work :)

7:57 The narrator is mimicking the lyrics of the Smashmouth song "Allstar". I can't be the only one who noticed this.
Listen, I understand these videos take a while to make, but half a fucking year? I'd be a little less annoyed if we atleast got some updates every once in a while, but he doesn't even bother with that. When an upload schedule is this atrocious I'm gonna complain a little bro sorry.

Guys it’s almost that time of the year
The American motto: Okay, but more
OS - "Trouble sleeping?" Me - Yeah, that's why I am here.
This should've been a small unit in my history class, I would've paid attention, heck I would've wrote an essay on the subject if I had too.
Please do the new zealand invasion from england
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.  I didn't say they were smart people.  (ftfy)

29:10 "Not the curtains again Mr President"   AGAIN?  Now I know oversimplified wouldn't include this if there wasn't some truth to it.
The Belgian revolution would be a great  episode, the 1830 revolt caused by an opera, the Ten day campaign (1831 Belgian-Dutch War) and the international diplomacy stuff. Maybe be even a mention to the Brabantine/1st Belgian Revolution and the United Belgian states. With the "Belgian founding fathers" Jan Andries van der Mersch, Hendrik van der Noot and Jan Frans Vonck.
When will we be seeing your Russia and Ukrainian war video?
MORE VIDEOS
You haven’t made a video in a long time
Colombia war
You really should do a vid on the Prussian-Austrian war (seven weeks war)
Hello Oversimplified I have a question. Can you please make a video about apartheid in SouthAfrica ? Also I would like to see African history.
👍👍
as a canadian, I would rather fight and die then become an american. why? there are tons of reasons, but the first is any nation that has a population that elects a president like trump would fk canada over, so no stay away and keep the dumbasses that voted for trump away. again, that's only the first reason.

CUZ BIDENS COMMIN BABY!! I died😂😂😂
Hey it would be kinda cool if you did a remastered version of WWI. I don't know, in that vid the audio is kinda wacky and the video is short. But now, you edit better, your mic has better quality, and your videos are a lot longer. I would really like you to make a higher quality version and rewritten script better explained and everything. Do what you like, this is a suggestion.
Hey I think you should come back bc I have a good war that my dad was an and that is Bosnian war from 1992 to 1995 a short video after all of these months

oversimplified pls make a video about the separation of India or the ottoman empire :))
He sounds like trevor from gta 5 at the end
Could you do one on the English Civil War?
Can we have a moment of silence for John Jacob Astor for being lost to history. He was a German immigrant who became the first multi millionaire in the US and in 1810 funded an overland expedition to the Oregon territory. He founded Fort Astoria in 1811, which was a fur trading post. But due to the breakout of The War of 1812 sold it to Hudson Bay in so it wouldn't be targeted by the British.

As an American I feel horrible that my people and country are known for colonizing and taking over places. And feel bad that that's what I'm known for as an American and for my race. Oh yeah and racism and being obsessed with guns.

Someyanky once told me the continent is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed They was looking kind of dumb with their finger and their thumb In the shape of an "L" on their forehead  Well the Americans start coming and they don't stop coming Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon When they outnumbered the brits more then 6-1 So much to steal, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the black sea? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never win if you don't know  Hey now, you're a yanky get your ships on, go invade  Hey now, you're an American, get the islsnds on, get killed And all that glitters is San Juan  Only shooting guns break the brits  It's a cool place and they say it gets colder You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older But the british men beg to differ Judging by the mistake in the treaty picture The land we own is getting pretty thin The water's getting warm so you might as well swim My world's on fire, how about yours? That's the way I hate it and I'll always get bored   Hey now, you're an yanky, get your ships on, go invade Hey now, you're an American, get the islands on, get killed All that glitters is San Juan  Only shooting guns break the britd  Hey now, you're an pig, get your carrots on, go die Hey now, you're an American, get the guns on, get the islands And all that glitters is Spuddy Only shooting guns  Somebody once asked could I make a square as line I need to get myself into this place I said, "Yup" what a concept I could use a little land myself And we could all use a little change  Well, the Americans start coming and they don't stop coming Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon When they outnumbered the Brits more then six to one So much to steal, so much to shoot So what's wrong with taking the black sea? You'll never know if you don't go (go!) You'll never win if you don't start

OverSimplified in 2030: Ukraine-Russia War - OverSimplified
11:45 An Englishman sends an Irishman to take Hawaiian Polynesian people to colonize an island named after Saint John, but in Spanish, that shared its name with an existing Spanish colony in the Caribbean.   Mister Worldwide
Borders based on rivers are an incredibly dangerous decision. One that led to constant warring in future.  Rivers have this tendency to erode soil and change their position. River meandering.  Of course, without satellites in orbit, determining borders was much harder. So it was perfectly understandable that some surveyors might not notice a river has move and claim their neighbors had invaded their territory.   I think this is why the US decided to make most of the states claimed from the Mexico very square. Lines of longitude and latitude may have been easier to calculate. Because it's not like there's many rivers out in the desert.
Am I the only one that thinks the narrator sounds like Algernon from Read Dead Redemption 2?

Can you do a video on the Vietnam war? my grandpa (who is sadly dead) served in that war and it would be nice if i knew about it.
No one gonna talk about the all star song refence
You should make a video about the “Russo-Ukrainian War
Oversimplified should make a video on the Balkan Wars or the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.
I cant wait for the next video of oversimplified it must be the best yet because it has taken so long for the next vid.
It's freakin' hilarious that even though this was made by an American, they're still shown as the selfish, moronic, gun happy twats.
America cannot invade Canada as the nation is a fellow N.A.T.O. member.
It's been six months.   I am ready.
You can make a bunch of videos about the ottoman empire  2 or 3 videos would be sufficient it would be spectacular from you
one of humanity's most persistent patterns:  part 1 : obtain freedom. part 2 : oppress someone.
do balkan wars please
Am I the only one who noticed the rat was carrying the combat shotgun from fallout 4?
We need more videos. We’re so addicted.
When’s the next video comin?
Oversimplified has advanced so much but has instead gone so complicated and ingenuine! The pig war takes half an hour of silly jokes, while world war 1 almost took minutes?

I need a new video ASAP!!!
Do that one extremely obscure war
Ok boys, Trudeau is trudont we must assemble to defeat this common evil and manifest our destiny north! USA USA USA USA 🇺🇸
Dhar Mann:
No one respects Biden.
2:36 Only US propaganda can claim that the war of 1812 was anything but a British victory. US tried to invade Canada and was repelled. That's a qualified British victory.  My country (Serbia) attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1876. trying to liberate some of the majority Serbian-inhabited land it occupied (south of today's Serbia) and was repelled and lost some ground in the Ottoman counterattack (even though we won some battles). And even though the borders did not change in the peace terms nobody here is trying to claim it as a draw. Similar thing happened in 1885. war with Bulgaria. Greece was likewise repelled in 1897 and 1922 by the Ottomans and didn't lose any of its prewar ground. Still a defeat is a defeat.
I know the next one is coming soon
Lol Biden is cominggggggggg!!!!!!!! What if he really goes to Canada...... uh oh
Stop being dead
Saya dari Indonesia, saya sangat mengagumi video ini dan juga saya sangat menunggu video baru yang akan di upload di channel ini selama 6 bulan

You should do the Russian of English civil wars next, or the Punic wars
This whole conflict sounds like something that would happen on a Minecraft server, "Alright guys who killed my pig?!?"😂
Harney also beat a woman to death with his cane and then fled the county like a bitch. Then he was acquitted of course. In conclusion Harney is a bitch and I hate that so many places are named in his honor, minus that one place they renamed
What a great ending I loved it I’m from Canada and I thought it was so funny 😂
I am Canadian. Watch your goddam mouth, we have our own secret plans to take y’all over.

Kinda conflicted cause while the U.S. did many horrific things on par with mini holocausts, I could both surf, ski, and dirt bike in the desert all in one day while eating better food than kings used to get. And then enjoy a private climate controlled home and more entertainment than I could enjoy in thousands of life times as long as I work a non-laborohs job 40hrs a week. So the making America better thing does feel kinda true...
Canadians: *unsubscribed to oversimplified*

The war of 1812 is like the direct to DVD sequel to the revolutionary war
A message to Oversimplified: Hi! I love your videos and I do respect your amazing humor, so I had an idea. A new section of history for your channel. Ancient Times of Rome, Greece, and perhaps Persia. I know you are very busy and have a lot to do, and probably have other things planned, so please just consider doing something a little different from modern history. Thank you very much, I love ya, goodbye. (But do the Vietnam War first)

"But the Americans keep coming and don't stop coming,  hoped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon,  When they outnumber the Brits more when six to one" My favorite line from this video lol

Wait a second fellow Canadians. If we join the US we can ruin their weapon factories and blow up the white house again without a border.
Harney: "Oregon's just gettin a bit too peaceful."  "You can't hurt me, Douglas!" "War crime this, treaty that." "War's just a part of who we are! why fight it?"
“ALRIGHT, YOU PSYCHOPATH, I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! I HATE YOU! I’VE ALWAYS HATED YOU!!!!!!!!!”   💀
Don't worry Canada. The only place Biden is going to is the retirement home.

oversimplified could you do a video on the irish war for independence

Honestly as a Canadian, i wouldn't mind being taken over by America, it would allow me to live in a southern state like Florida or Nevada.... it gets way tooo cold up here and depressing in the winter. Living somewhere more south would be nice ☺
The end is od
Start posting more if you can
It’s been five months we’ll get another video any time now

MAKE A NEW VIDEO PLEASE
Bro pig voice by morgen freemen
Well, we could invade OR we could wait for PM Castreau to finish wrecking Canada and have western Canada ask to join the US. Before any of our Canadian cousins get their noses out of joint, in 1979 I escorted a group of drunken Canadian naval officers on to Naval Station Charleston while singing Oh Canada, in French, at the top of our lungs. They were there for a port visit and we were their host ship. A good time was had by all.
Plz get staff, I don't want to hear your voice on a woman. It just feels wrong.
Oversimplified, I don’t want to bother you but I am really curious on when next video is done yet. Could you let me know an estimate on when the date for the next video will come out?
where the new video at
This is a cool history vid
Do the Russo Ukrainian War, Afghan American War, and the war in the Middle East. Do Vietnam and Korea as well.
U should do a vid on the Balkan war
Am i the only one noticing that oversimplifieds videos only get longer and longer, and so does the time between uploads?
Still waiting for a new video😅
You should do a 2 or 3 parter on the antebellum period 😳
this is video was super funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
America invades: That's what God wants us to do. Other nation does:  America: Now hol' up son.
You should make a video on King George, Kaiser Wilhelm and the Czar growing up together.
Oversimplified next video: Vietnam war
37:25 woah there dude with an angry mustache. We ain’t tryna have another repeat of the 2 WW.
Do the belgium revolution
The reason he hasn’t uploaded in so long is because he got shot by Trudeau
This was posted 5 months ago and it’s the most recent post… all I’ve wanted for months is for a new video cuz school teaches me nothing etc… but no, no *sigh*, no it just doesn’t happen not yet anyway
A war started by a pig-loving potato. Technoblade be like

"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming  Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running  It didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon  Since they outnumbered the Brits more than 6 to 1"
10:23 Judge: Order! ORDER! SHUT UP! (Throws his Mallet)
Hey Oversimplified, Great video, i was wondering if you could make a video about the Philippine Revolution. Love from the Philippines🇵🇭
What happened to him he disappeared. We need you in these troubling times to learn and be entertained with the humor.
Video suggestion: War of 1812
The beginning kind of racist
Does anyone know the name of the music used at 23:09 - 23:43  ??
I think this was my favorite Oversimplified video XD
Hey, could you maybe do a video about the War of 1812 or maybe a video covering the Korean War?  That would wonderful that would. Love channel btw
"Lyman, If you spare me I will grant you 3 wishes"
10:27 - 10:28 That's gonna hurt

OverSimplified is dead, he haven uploaded for 5 months
“its my density“ XD
6:27 it's been such a long time since I've seen eelslap. That's a blast from the past right there
The ending shows us he's going to create a war for more content.
OVERSIMPLIFIED MAKE A NEW VIDEO OF THE VIETNAM WAR PLEASE 🤔
Wouldn’t it have been great if Morgan Freeman actually decided to be in one of your shows.
Nice all star singing 😃
But you don't mention India 🇮🇳 in any of your video.
Ummmmm, I know we do this every time…..and I honestly believe you wait for my okay🙄🤪😂🤣😂……but I think we’re really ready for another one.  Thank you!
14:43 That sherrif is Canadian
I've always wanted those glorified Frenchman to be shown what it's like to be beaten the crap out of by an old man
Hey whens the next video?
But 1 problem you cannot take over the world.
That last bit has to go to jail for killing me with laughter
Considering OverSimplified's upload schedule he should be coming out with a 2 part series within a week or 2.
Excuse me good sir, the Panama Canal wasn’t built yet
These are the best videos! I watched these before and I got ahead of my class!
7:57 I can't unhear All Star
Personal vendetta against Canada???
You come back checking if he uploads lol
When does the next episode come out
That pig sounded like Morgan freeman
Good luck invading our free healthcare system lol
USA wants WAR!
George Pickett, dead last in his class  at West Point.  Interestingly, he had been sponsored to WP by one Congressman Abraham Lincoln. According to reports,  during the Civil War, Pickett would not permit anyone to personally disparage AL in his presence.
"...like rats, or disease!"
This could have been resolved with a coin
Its been 5 months he will post another video soon
For the immature spotted dick is a dessert
this entire video is absolutely hilarious
how about a video on finland?
Hello?
scott and henry VIII sound similar 😂😂😂
buchanan was a chicken tho 😂😂😂😂
but i like to think they did 😂😂😂 omg i freaking died
I wouldn’t have just spent 38 minutes watching this video if Lyman would have just built a complete fence.
Can you do the story in the life of Queen Elizabeth something like your King Henry VIII video🥺🥺🥺🥺🤍🤍🤍🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
OverSimplified, where is the vietnam war vid
We NEED War of the Roses  All the Brits will agree with me
I’d love to see you do the sengoku jidai
They should've just said "straight line? Straight line." again
The fact that this channel only has 6 million subscribers.                              Is uncool.
0:01 NoRdVpN
Biden would probably forgor invade canada 💀
Calls video oversimplified. Is 38 minutes long
Can you do the Cristero War
to many verb is so hard to learn it
Oversimplified, you’re forgetting about the Vietnam war, Afghanistan, Iraq, and how you guys started a war among your selves. *You don’t want a repeat of Vietnam, do you?*
Gotta love history as it reminds us of how hypocritical society is when it's past actions are matched up with it's current actions. Though the one thing much of the world supports is the art of history revisionism, so perhaps a potent topic of oversimplification would be on ways each nation re-writes it's history to suite their induvial narratives (CRT, I am looking at you as well).
Part 1: Before the pig Part 2: Pig Part 3: Military Escalation  - The Pig War According to Wikipedia
Who said YouTube isn’t educational huh this is more educational than what I learned in school
33:24 why does this make me laugh so hard
Can you do video about the Russia Ukrainian war that is happening now?
Now, the ending was a little overboard. Even though I am American.
I bet the next video is the vietnam war
Bruh it’s been 5 months, we need our OverSimplified new content fix!   -sincerely, everyone, probably
"I got my spotted dick " wtf is that line
You should do a video on the Irish road to independence
Could you do a video on Ancient India so I have a reason we should watch your vids in school?
Bruh?!?!
Can you do some Irish history please

Lazy shit, uploading 2 videos per year
4:05 got me dead  Just as god intended 😭💀

Vietnam war please
AMERICA HECK YEEAAAAAHHHHH....BIDENS COMMIN BABY!!!!! FRICK COMMUNISM!!!
U don't know the power of the dark side
You can release that vietnam war video anytime now😅
What happened to the channel 🙂 Wheres new videos man
Oversimplified please come back
Taking Greenland is a better idea than Canada
Imagine a YouTube channel based on History using Biased historical facts to encourage Americans to self terminate for being American to encourage anti American hate and separatism.
I’ve never laughed harder at a sponsor segment  “Your connection is so safe” “Who the hell are you”
🇺🇦 Also, I'm getting comments as new as a few minutes ago
I used this to sleep I be listening and I hey something I wake right back up
Wait...Mexico was that big? What happened ?
The potato was wearing sonic shoes 😂😂😂
Oversimplified when are you gonna upload a new video
Harney: (almost starts war with Britain) “This enraged General Scott, who punished him severely”
Reasons I don't trust white people:
I hope the next video is about the Ukrainian war and he turns it into a message about helping to support Ukraine and donating money to them
I've lived in Vancouver, WA most of my life... I'm 39 now and my lifelong dream of going up into the fort's bastion and firing a cannon still is yet unfulfilled.  The most remarkable thing about the Colunmbia River is it's always protected us and made us safe from Portlanders.  And I also found a washed-up 6 foot dead sturgeon last summer..
So when will the next one come out?
Did i just see one of the oversimplified guys pump rack a break action shotgun...
his spotted what??
6:36 lemme guess.. blocked in Germany?
30:41 is the best change my mind
I love these videos and I see you have a lot of success on tik tok too, people are reposting ur videos I am just sorry because you post 2 times a year, anyway good job man keep up
When comparing imbeciles…. Biden certainly wins….  So, Canada may actually want to be concerned lol. FJB!

Would love to see an Oversimplified take on the Seven Years War / French Indian War! This video, as always, was amazing, informatively educational, funny, and just well done. Thank you for your effort and work!
Oversimplified, Why aren't you talking about Germany enough in your videos?
the great.... TECHNOBLADE
can you do guatemalan plz
If you ever have a sponsor that has to do with something like animation or learning more about stuff this would be the intro for the animation sponsor: my channel maybe oversimplified tell you what's not oversimplified animating And this would be the intro for that learning about more stuff sponsor: My channel maybe August simplified but never tell you what's not going for simplified learning
this is better than Dream SMP's story             ..and now we wait
Oof 1,3 69 sheep. Did anyone else notice this?
Guys I’ve done the math   Oversimplified is going to release a video this week
If someone could- could someone explain why the United States, Canada, and Mexico never folded into one government? Logically speaking, it sounds like a nightmare to organize, but wouldn't Canada and Mexico get more out of it than they'd lose? Or is there more nuanced details that I am overlooking, I'd be happy to know. I'd personally be happy with all of us working together on...well, a whole list of projects. All three have a lot to offer to each other and could benefit from it.
Could you make a vid on the space race ?
When are u going to make another video
19:08 *”K I L L E D  Y O U R  P I G”*
You lozer

Dude, what do you have against us beaver bois, we never did anything bad to America (I think).
it's sad he hasn't uploaded in 5 months

Next you should make the Yugoslavian War or the Greek Revolution
This guy is soooo good (could you eventually make a Nepal video)

Y'know, for being considered an idiot, Harney made a pretty decent plan.

Are you dead oversimplified
It has been 5 months now, that’s how you know oversimplified is about to blow our socks off
Is... That waddles?
Those last fucking hilarious sentences 😆
A war between 2 capitalist pigs
You should do a video on the Titanic
Try and do a video about the plague.
I miss this channel
I missed this channel
Based on his upload pattern, I predict his next video will release before June 24.
Just got the oversimplified plush and be ready to watch a lot of nascar
General Harney is just the great-great-grandfather of Captain McGraw
Hey bro quick question, where did you get and what kind of version did you get that U.S.S.R Anthem from the Cold War Oversimplified 1. Because it started growing on me.
Can you do the crusades please, it would be interesting, especially for the new looks for them… 👀👀👀
You should do a series on the Roman Empire
WHEN THE NEXT VID BRO
upload
I literally got spoiled by Google Maps
Can u please do the chinese civil war next ?
when is the new vid coming bois?
It looks like it’s a Star Wars movie
could you make more videos im a big fan but i dont like watching yhe same videos over and over
do the Gulf War 1991
God, I teared up a little at the thought of American annexation of Canada.
Funny thing about that little tip on Minnesota....  Because of the Lake of the Woods, those who live there CANNOT get to the rest of the US without first entering into Canada... (or, by boat, but who does that!?)
Hey @oversimplified guy,would you mind making one on Bismarck and the splendid isolation
Once again he disappeared for 5 month's
Can you make a video on Tennessee history
3:55 "I hear voices all the time" lol
When you think about it, Biden might end his 1 term presidency with a bang, and actually invade Canada by mistake. Democrats have barred Biden from re election as a democrat.
Early Americans implementing Manifest Destiny with stealth bombers, M1 Thompsons, McDonald's and trains decades before they were even invented?  Yes. Truly American.
the treaty is said is the middle channel
I want a Charlamagne Oversimplified video so baaad
My plushy finally arrived! Now I’m watching this with him to celebrate and I’ve named him Pierre ❤️!
we need another video
9:35 the MIDDLE of the channel, the islands said to be split.
What editor do you use for your battle map
I can see those islands from my bedroom window and I had no idea about any of this. I’m not suprised though; as it all came down to an American being stupid as hell vs a Brit holding on to national pride.
Hey oversimplified, I noticed you haven’t uploaded in awhile and I don’t know if you are working on another video right now but I have an idea for one: Vietnam war
When is the next one?!?!?
outro: agreed
No one:  Absolutely no one:  OverSimplified: ”Straight line? Straight line.”
Ahhh, the good ol'days-👴🏻
I don't no no Russian or Engiles
basically a fun history lesson
what the actual fuck was the end of the video-
why are there no latest uploads on this channel?
I remeber watching this live
This...is...a...MASTERPIECE
why you stop posting
The happiest moment of this video is right in the middle of the lenght.
please drop the vietnam war or how ever you spell it
hi,  i love history and i love your videos! but i was wondering if you could make a video about the Vietnam war, this seems like a very interesting topic
a

Fun fact it seems like he post every 6 months and that also means we have a like 1/180 of getting a video early :D oh wait o n o                          S S S S S S S S S  S S S S S S S S S S  S S S S S  S  S S S S S S S S S S    You still here? Dam nice… job I guess here’s a random face  >:D
Best line ever… Straight line? Straight line?

This guy just makes learning history way more fun.  Edit: Omg tysm for the likes
30:10
3:10
As an American, this describes my people perfectly
The treaty says It goes through the MIDDLE channel so its both British and America
For anyone wondering, the border between lake superior and The Lake of the Woods was decided via an old fur trading route along a chain of lakes.
We haven't heard from you for months! Pls come back to us!
He should do the Easter rising
The best days are when OverSimplified posts a new video
The last bit got me 😂😂😂
It wasn't about color as much as conquest.  Conquest is an equal opportunity offender all throughout history with all types of people groups.
Oversimplified is getting more and more unhinged with each video and I am thoroughly enjoying it
I heard all star
26:27 Boaty McBoatface’s Great Grandfather.
37:23 as an American this is what we will do in 2030
Do reconquista
Next do the Toledo war please
Upload again
Haha funny video fp
It's time brother, we need you once again.
when is the next one coming out?
I finally got the plushy!  😆😄😜😁
Suddenly at the very end it goes from historical comedic video to pro American imperialism propaganda against Canada just kidding lol 😂😂😂
There’s only one thing I want in this life oversimplified to do a video on Celtic history
Lets go invade canada
Make a video about the greek revolution plzzzzz
How About a video on the ottoman empire
Keeping making video
can you make a vidoe of ukriane and russia war
Where’s that Vietnam war episode you promised in the Cold War episode
I love the enthusiasm
Do you reckon you'll ever cover something like Vietnam or Korea?
You should make a tiktok
Worry about your own curves
You should make video like the Iraq War and the Ukraine war
4:10 MMMMM YES 1820 B2 STEALTH BOMBERS
When's the next video?!? I would like be educated in an Oversimplified way, thank you.
You think Biden can do all of that :)?
Am I the only one who thinks that Vietnam is next? He said he would do one in the cold war part 2. And it's been 3 years at the time of saying this.
I live about a hour from the islands and I thought this war was always the funniest
37:08
13 (69) nice lol
can we have the ottoman empire
Nice all star reference at 7:57
Make one of 55 days at peeking
Just to FYI the ad in the middle.  VPN's don't do as much for security as basically every VPN ad ever claims.  They make it harder for someone to target you specifically in various ways, but they don't do much of anything for security attacks that are not targeting you specifically (which is most of them).
I really think you should do a video on turkeys independence
its pretty funny how Hudson Bay was involved in this
Can we talk about Taiwan history?🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼     🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼
Maybe you could do one on Benito Mussolini?
Please make more videos...we miss them alot!!!
Can u make a video (one or two parts) about all of israel's war/conflicts?
It took me more than 1 month to figure out that the thumbnail of this video is based of Star Wars. Bruh
Rlly boi?? no new video!?
When  do u do Vietnam war ?
6:15 my mans got a ps5, an xbox one, two phones, and a laptop this man is literally scrooge mcduck
Imperialist Stuart is the best Stuart
Oh come on Nord vpn
We wouldn’t invade Canada because we are it’s closest ally what wouldnt be very nice
Do the phillipine revolution history!
America has third leg
I got a feeling next video with be Vietnam war  Edit: if your wondering why look at the map on the table at 15:42
Just so you know America, Canada has a high Ukrainian population.

9:24 ........straight line?
DO THE EGYPTIANS!!!!!
WTF
35:57 nha it was that Germany hated the british
This plushy better be as big as my leg or I’m gonna buy more of them.

America gots back
@Oversimplified can we get a Yugoslav Wars video?

Animals are tortured a lot
Do alexandre the great please
When is a new video coming?😫
Canada is scared af
8:05 I'm sorry but god damn
where did the legend go himself
Try make history of some south east asian countries
Hawaiians being shipped a trio of disputed islands along the US-Canadian Border.... totally checks out.  Islander have always felt pretty well screwed over by everyone occupying Hawaii.  I live on Maui and the HSM movement pretty much died out because COVID shut down the entire tourism industry and everyone's grateful for the economic boosts brought on by tourists.
I loved his version of all stars, i hope to see more videos
These vids got a lot better
Rest In Peace oversimplified
My favorite part of this video is, probably, that both parties seem to be in agreement that the pig could speak English.
Hey can you do a roman empire video?
No mean to pry or anything, but uh… Vietnamese war video that promised in the Cold War video?
I love how a American man pulled out a AK-47 at 16:01
the great northern war would be epic as an oversimplified video
So… When’s the next upload? :)
0:52  1I'm laughing because 1 I'm part native  2 I didn't say they were white lol
Any chance you can do an episode, or maybe a series on the Habsburg Dynasty??
So.... where do I sign up?
I’m from Minnesota eh and you got Minnesota so it’s close enough to Canada EH?!?!?!
You should make a video about the drug wars of the 70s to late 90s
do the korean war
Can you make a video of the Mexican and American war
Nope. Still no new video.
How long till the next one?
Come on man. Post something
Return
we need a video about either the vikings or the romans
I love the work he puts into these videos, He makes history so much more fun. Keep up the good work!
I like how every problem border they came up,Americans always say"Straight Line"Because they want the westward
Where do you create a video like this?
Bruh, so basically Canada want fair shared bodered but U.S decided not to do that? Hmm, that kinda not weird at non- and loved U.S people in international scale 😑. We call it classic Capitalist
Omfg I laughed so hard when they bombed the bison 🤣😭😭😭
why do you take so freaking long to make it it is becouse you do all this youerself or other things
You should do a video on the English civil war
do a video about the mexican american war
Hi. Please meke a video on Indian history, how India got independence from british
It's almost been 6 months, you all know what that means
In the universe where the pig war did happen, the civil war probably didn’t. Crazy.
Pig
Never thought technoblade would cause a war
Man, I just want to know how Americans keep outpopulating everybody else on this forsaken continent. I feel like every time we're technically allowed somewhere, we instantly outpopulate the natives (or Europeans who claimed the land, because nobody cared about the _natives_ back then). It's like we're historically the humans amongst the elves
Where is Vietnam! -insert fortunate son-
Reading/listening about US History always gives me 1 reason to like the US and then 5 more reasonsto hate them.
Do a Roman empire video, I love your videos!
are you going to make history of florida? thats where i live
He Should Make A Video About The Mechanical Turk Very Cool
Imagine if San Juan became independent
POV: When it has been several month and there’s no oversimplified upload so you rewatching old video and do oversimplified jokes in the comment
Americans are greedy
no just no (im canadian) :(
you should do a balkans wars video
Hey! I love your videos, can you make video about winter war?
The start is frighteningly accurate.
WHENS THE NEXT VIDEO
Find someone who loves u as Charles Griffin loved his sheeps...*baa*
NEW VIDEO NOWW PLEEASEE 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢
I love that there’s a 40 min video on this 😂 being from this area i find it hilarious
Dude, you barely mention the Philippines in your vids..
Biden can't stay awake long enough to invade a dinner during the blue plate special! Can't remember anything to be vengeful over.
i wouldn't recommend NordVPN  pretty deceitful billing practices, will autobill for services not wanted/rendered and not refund. AVOID.
The last few minutes are comedy gold 😂
The ending was glorious. The passion and anger in his voice
Bro where is this man’s next video
I like this video so much man
First time back since 2019 went through quarantine and wars still good as new!!
When is the next video it's been 5 months already (as of 10th May).
Yea right lol the divided States of America are too busy fighting themselves we won't be going to Canada anytime soon
I love how his voice changes so much in the ending monilouge
The ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fun Fact: (Correct me if I am wrong) The United States created a plan to invade Canada, known as war plan red. So, if it comes to it, clear some way for the A-10 Warthogs and Wendy's.
When will a new video come out?!!
it's my density!!!! true by stereotypes
We bouta reenact fallout? I'm cool with that
Pls make a video on 'The Liberation War of 1971'
The ending sounds like Stewie from family guy, maybe just a bit different voice
Plese more history viodo 😭😬😭😭😭😭
1:22 is the greatest roast in history
Can you upload? I'm waiting for a video you haven't uploaded for 5 months
i know where you live, upload now or things will get bad for you.
Please come to Brazil
Did you know Canada has never lost a war
I wish I'd been on San Juan island. It would have been the most exciting experience of my life
I dont know if you like my idea but this is my idea for another video  Vietnam war
The crying voices always, and I really do mean always, make me crack up.
Do the yougoslav wars
33:25 Me when I'm at the last straw with my sibling
Next you should do Vietnam. You didn't explain it much in the Cold War video
This reminds me of the Toledo War.
You should try doing the Cuban revolution ❤️
Ummmm, let’s maybe not invade canada
100 years war please
Post new vid
hi. i think you should make a tom creann or shackleton oversimplified I would def watch that. also great content.
That was the absolute greatest ending to an oversimplified video I’ve ever seen
as a Canadian I'm scared
Sorry, but the way he draws u.s.a it looks like florida is it’s penis
Where's the coldwar part 2?
I remember hearing a out this war on an episode of Hey Arnold!  Also like how the potato has Sonic The Hedgehog's legs, socks and sneakers.   What great wisdom will we learn next time form our favorite fat stick figures of epic history.
I’m just Asking When will the Next Vid happen?
Can anyone please tell me where Oversimplified get's the soundeffect such as the two here 35:55?
Do Korea war
Is it just me or does Florida looks like a dong
The narration is so effing good love your work bro

What did this episode turn into?😕
Why not do the roman Empire
Hey how did the pig go in cow crap if there where no cows
Predictions for next video: Vietnam war, Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great
Vietnam War next?
Make more videos
So I know I'm late to the party here, but your use of the old school Lol Guy face at 7:32 and 16:37 is completely wrong. It's a laughing face, not an angry or unhappy face. I love your videos but this mistake just rustles my jimmies.
hey you shoul;d make a adolf pin
Me when I step on lego: 14:01
The great northern war
I have to wait so long in between episodes 😭
You should do a mini war on the republic of Texas
Doesn't feel like 5 months.
Do the Roman Empire next
the outro was funny
Speaking of the empire of Germany, you should make a video on their creation.
i started laughing so hard at the end
5 Months No Video THERES GOING TO BE A TAX FOR THAT
China civil war now 😡
Chinese civil war now 😡
Can we have a Chinese civil war video because the Chinese civil war is just tooooooo good of a story 😭pls get me out 😭

Rest in peace OverSimplified You were an amazing person not only to my students but me as a History teacher too :) R.I.P
That nordvpn guy is a master of stealth who could have single-handedly won war’s with his skill
18:58 to 19:38 Is the one that made me laugh the hardest
WTF is going on in the mind of Charles Griffin?
and if Germany didn't give those islands to America, do you think we could have avoided 2 world wars?   damn pigs man
OverSimplified should make a video about Nathan Hale
Please do a pirate episode about Blackbeard, Captain Kid and others
the middle
At 7:58 this man almost created rap
The (Almost) Pig War
37:13 I would like to see you try the Brits still have our back
I never knew Oregon was a British-American Condominium!
A joint occupation is a CONDOMINIUM. Call it what it is! *Oregon Country, UK / USA* was a Condominium! A subdivision of both nations!
Looks like biden forgot about the invasion💀
You should do a video on Ukrainian 🇺🇦 and Russia 🇷🇺 part 1
Me waiting for the Franco-Prussian War Video
I too would be confused if a normal civilian in early 1800s apparel ripped their clothing and skin away to reveal a naked alien with blue, stylized hair.
I live in Ohio which is near lake Erie1 time when we were troll fishing I thought we would go to Canada
The last 2 minutes makes me hate any national American movies
Oversimplified be doin’ ‘Miniwars #5 Ukraine Crisis’
MAKE MORE VIDEOS!!!!!! Please.
I would like a video on India
You don't talk about the Philippine history
33:06
Oversimplified you should do an episode for Donald Trump
Hey can you do the gold rush in australia please
WE. NEED. VI. ET. NAM.
And he never posted ever again
This is my first oversimplified video I've seen. You sir earned yourself a sub!
This guy stoped posting
It is actually pronounced barkshire
The British navy are the real chads in this story
You could do a short video on the "Honey War" between Missouri and Iowa. Its very similar to this, a sheriff comes in to collect taxes and is told to get off the property, steals some honeycombs and is thrown in prison. Military shows up on one side, a bunch of farmers with farming gear converted into weapons show up on the other, it looks like something is going to go down, but finally cooler heads prevail and nothing happens. Oddly enough though, the border between Missouri and Iowa is still being disputed to this day. There's an "agreement", but that's it.
One of the best video ever made
18:30 anyone else see the camera in the window?
I swear to god this guy rarely uploads but when he does its always gonna be a banger!
12:25 is that the KSP VAB music? Lmao
Oversimplified. It’s been 3 years. Where is Vietnam oversimplified?!?!?!?
We are due for a new one of these..

Hey um, Dave(dunno your actual name lol). So recently people started talking to me about Ghengis Khan. I really dunno who the hell is that. Could you do me a favor and make a video about who the hell is that during 2022?
Oversimplified is a looser. He can't make videos in less time.
Oversimplified sacrificed his canadian audience for the ending  *This enraged his father , who punished him severely*  edit : HOW DID THIS BLOW UP
Your video is nastily funny man

Do Yogoslavia breakup

I feel like he's saying his speech differently- like hes saying it with more emotion.  Still luv this channel :) <3
The founding fathers were so good at their jobs, being racists, homophobes, sexists, rapists etc.
Almost at that 6th month mark you know what that means.. new video soon. I hope it’s the space race
Canada would say they were sorry and raise the stars and bars themselves. Suck it snow Mexicans.

7:57 here os the all star instrumental if you are looking for it
"And they don't stop coming ...."
As a brit, the US doesn't need more territory. The last thing needed is Canada becoming US territroy.
Crazy that this hole thing is like right beside where I live
it is been so long i just want him back
Holy shit! Oversimplified got morgan freaking Freeman in his video!!!!
Definitely a very specific request, but you should delve into the irish war of independence and civil war, incredibly interesting.
31:03 was this Morgan freeman lmao?

Straight line?

There’s actually a Fallout reference in this video, try to find it! (The answer is below)             3:42 the rat is holding a combat shotgun from fallout
Guys I can confirm that God told us to
I can't believe that pig ate me. So rude.
When did Oversimplified start becoming woke?
The fact this was one of the few conflicts in American history I didn’t really know about this video really took me for a ride and I loved it.
I live next door to the Islands and I never knew their history.
I just noticed. Why is Florida red at the very beginning? Britain never owned Florida. It was a Spanish colony.
I like the joke in 16:12 it shows that in the 1800-1900 Yankees were so desperate for gold
100 Years War
37:50
just checkin in on new oversimplified.. feels like about that time
You gotta make a vid of Mexican American war
Where is Vietnam oversimplified
griffin and the customs collector "baaaa" ing at each other is beautiful
damn Americans stealing our islands
I feel like oversimplified working with a team would be much better, he could release videos monthly rather than once every 5 months what do you think
Dude you need to do one on the dream smp. There are many channels saying “dream smp oversimplified” reclaim thy throne!
when is the ww3 vid coming out. best regards a person from latvia
Can you make a Viking video about Norway
Mexican War of Independence OVERSIMPLIFIED
We should do another round.  I recommend we go to war one more time with each other in present day.
Only just noticed the posters in the negotiating room - absolute class!
Okay but jokes aside though, why do Canadians bitch in the comments so much demanding Canada be mentioned? I mean I'm south african and do you see me demanding south africa and our history be talked about? No
Mmmm i like your videos how about you do a Mexican Revolution video I mean if you want
You have an almost British sense of humor. Are you a traitor to the American coarse? Do you hate our best president ever, namely Trump and his American humor? God, you're such a Euro!
Still waiting for Vietnam War.
I have been searching for the Vietnam war on your page. Please make one
“Bloody delicious emu”  Maybe that could be a new Australian food
You should cover the American Indian Wars in the 1870s!
Dunno if you read your comments but can you do queen Victoria oversimplified
5:42 the flag is upside down
What will come out first? The next oversimpllified video or helluva boss season 2?

I passed my exam
I didn’t realize how many children watch Oversimplified’s videos. I mean look at all the smooth brain comments whining about a lack of video for their country or asking “where video?”.  To all the children, are you actually learning any history from this channel, or are you just watching for all the jokes and bright colors.
New vid pls
Yo bro can you do a Philippines Revolution one?
This is the only channel I think I actually have  sat through and laughed during the commercials ,thanks great channel 👍
Where is the Vietnam War
Id love to see you do vietnam and the aftermath
12:53 That was really funny
I think you should do a seven years war video
"Spread across the map, like rats...or disease " had me dead💀
The thing about Canada is that they could just flood the USA with maple syrup
Like rats or a disease? B*tch move.
We need New video!!!
A video about alaska next? Or Ottoman empire?
Man where are you I need more history !! XD
In about a month should be the next video, but then again he could be oversimplifying the balkans

All this over some islands, some potatoes and a pig

Where is Oversimplified videos about Hitler?!?!

This guy's videos are amazing but, he takes so long to upload it's been almost 5 months.
Canada: So uhh....Australia, can I borrow a few emus? I think America is getting a few ideas
37:00 the most legendary 1 minute 43 seconds in our lives
I'm so happy to know the great American tradition of pulling guns in anger is still with us. Brings a tear to my eye *sniff sniff* Now, if you'll excuse me, I see some land being held by squatters just outside of my property. I must prepare my musket.
It’s May and still no new episode!!! 😩😫
YO CAN U DO 1971 INDO-PAKISTAN WAR??

In Soviet Russia, youtubers sponsor companies.
I pay for premium to avoid ads, and usually  just skip thru mid-vid ads...but this time my hands were occupied. (The way its snuck in was too good.)  Needless to say, as a huge Army, I'm glad I saw it.
32:30 Gotta love the rolling Half Baked scene
I’m slightly scarred about the last part of this video do to I’m a canadien
“I'm not dumb. I just have a command of thoroughly useless information.”

We need the Vietnam war
33:29 love it. The voice acting is so on point.
Do genghis khan video
This is the first time i have heard a historian turn into a full blooded patriot
i’m confused… did you say bts is cool or were you just making fun of them? because if you were making fun of them, there’s a reason we are called army
did anyone notice the all star song reference at 7:58
To those who wonder the value of $100 in the 19th century, it was $2,281.78 which for a farmer, it is an outraged sums

Lol Biden 😂
OverSimplified can you do like the ukraine-russo war
Waiting for your next video guys …….. when will it get released?
Honestly, i'm interested in seeing The Golden Age - OverSimplified, because why not?
This is so disgraceful for your forebearers. So little respect of what they did so that you can have what you have today. "Spread like disease or rats throughout the continent".  All you ever have is thanks to them. Shame
Because of you I ENJOY history now:') ...
What India did for Kashmir America did it for a random bunch of islands
Oversimplified should be the education Minister
I got a pig .. You can just have it..🇨🇦🐖

This guy hasn't been uploading for, 4 months. Prob working on another amazing video.
Ahhhhh yes "I didn't say they were white people"
Why does spuddy have sonic the hedgehog shoes?
We know the next video will be 2 parts because of the oversimplified pattern.  But we don't know what it will be..   It may be   (1) Vietnam War  (2) Crusades  (3) Mongols  (4) Russian Civil War
This man taught me this is 33 minutes, but it takes teachers weeks or even months
When will the next video come ? Hopefully before ww3 officially starts
10:16
Video idea, Ukraine vs Russia
maybe you could do 30 years war.

Which history vid are you going to do next?
Can you do English war I want to learn it

The end of this video is gold
what about nicaragua
3:34 ayo look at florida
Make Bible based stories
I'm waiting to Korean war you should make it too
Still waiting for the newest video 😄
Will you ever do a war on terror you know because i would like to see a oversimplified version of it
I can never tell if this is for kids or adults
The ending feels different after the 22 of Feb 2022.
Bro calm down your gonna start a war with Canada and i dont trade embargo's on my maple syrup
ITS BEEN 4 MONTHS WE GOT A BIG VIDEO COMING BOYS 🌪
The Americans, and ONLY the Americans, consider the war of 1812 a draw.
Oversimplify needs to do a titanic video
Sea land civil war
who noticed the him singing all star part (edit: heres the time: 7:53)
Every time oversimplified uploads, it feels like Christmas
Its so sad to see the good friends Pickett and Harney take different sides of the Civil War.
Only Canada? why no the entire continent?
That ending was the greatest thing I've seen
hey oversimplified i was just wondering can you do the irish easter rising or just us claiming back land from the brits
Yo bro could you do ottoman empire over simplified?
can you make a video on 1000 day war please
You should do some British accent while narrating on the British side bro haha
" being Americans, they pulled out gun on him "   - OverSimplified 2022
can you please make a video on Indian Revolution ??😅 i think it will be interesting
I have analyzed his upload schedule, a video should come out in 0-2 months.
Everybodys commenting on the ending but not the dude just standing there laughing at Lyman as the pig eats his potatoes
Wonder when the next video will be out, and what is it about
Biden would lose the war since he forgot which border is Canadian.
This IS pretty oversimplified, more than usual lol. The Americans had a vested interest in access to the Puget Sound, not just the Columbia. the Columbia, for starters, was difficult and dangerous to navigate, due to the sand bars at its mouth, so the puget sound with its calm, deep waters, became immensely desirable to both parties. In the original territory negotiations, the British refused to allow american ownership of any territory around the sound, so both just settled on joint occupation.  also, the fur trade was already on its way out due to over poaching. The Hudson Bay Company, by the time of Douglas, was already diversifying its economic interests into logging, farming, and mining due to the dwindling beaver supply, and lack of demand in Europe due to shifting interests.
Maybe another video about the Northern War
What is your upload schedule
Do a video of the Netherlands!
Man you are great pls make more videos
do the new zealand reveloution please
Takes so long for another upload please get a team
@OverSimplified I just had a idea. Would you want to do pieces on important figures in history like Joanne of Arc, Alexander the Conqueror, and  others?
“And who was it who spoke to god? I thought it was billy right? It was shrodingers cat right? I hear voices all the time.”  Lol
Am I the only one who thought abt technoblade when I saw this video?
le contenu de ce gars est incroyable
This is hands down the greatest masterpiece of our generation
As a Canadian I think maybe it’s best that he doesn’t talk about Canadian history in WWI
Bros talking abt pigs in Canada but not Vietnam
As if you were of your YouTube channel I would like to see the British empire history
Florida between the legs. Lol
I like how Americans who want to indoctrinate children with lies will claim this video is anti-American and is trying to indoctrinate children with lies 😂
Im leaving canada lol
U should make one on the Mexican American war
Makes me think if the United States would exist today if the British had escalatedit rather than opting for 12 years of strained peace.   Between the British/Canadians in the north and Confederate States in the south, could the United States have reasonably beaten both?  Maybe the Mexicans would have seen the war happening on both sides and opted to create a third front.  Makes you wonder if the geopolitics of today could have been completelydifferent becasue of 1 dead pig...
Looking back Americans also do same as putin and now preact 😂😂
Ayo😳
When are going to uploade again?  Your videos are the best video I have ever seen
33:29 Captain Hunt's mildly surprised/impressed expression 🤣
i like how from a history teacher, he went into an American patriot! God Bless the land of the free, and the home of the brave
First
Oversimplified, thank you for years of perfect, funny and entertaining content
Can you do a video about "The Renaissance" and that large time period?
Oversimplified I have a request can u make a video about the Indian freedom struggle
1846 Treaty: and the line of boundary *”will go through the said channel”* Said channel: Middle channel. Oops
36:07 What is the music here
This mans voice makes me fall asleep
Us taking the flagpole is such a british thing to do
33:29 me when I catch someone trying to steal my Xbox
Just wait for global warming to kick in and for Canada to become one of the few comfortably habitable places in the world...
a poor person ? well thanks for clearing that up
Hey maybe some video about polish vs soviets conflict in 1919-1921 I think its very interesting topic for a video
Bruh if this man was a teacher I will probably be getting straight A’s in class

7:57 why did it sound like shrek lol 😆
In the brits story about the pig it was possessed by god, the american story it was possessed by the devil!
I really want to see Oversimplified go crazy like that again
Oversimplified needs to do Vietnam
The All Star remix was fire!
28:37
I crave medieval content, history daddy.
7:58
6:20 Sooo, by that logic, I can also have access to every piece of Guardians of the Video Game content ever known to mankind? Well count me in! ...if I wasn't so broke....
Biden coming with a VENGEANCE huh… NAILED IT 👍 Hope all you morally superior TDS infected ideologues are enjoying the chaos… Hey, least there’s no MEAN TWEETS eh 😵‍💫am I right😆 You PATHETIC GOONS
So If we’re to demonize all history in this way then all mankind are monsters and not just products of their time in history… OH I get it… that’s why you’re a self hating ideologue 👍
Yeah let’s harshly pass judgment on our past with infallible moral standards like entitled aHoles cuz that’s totally fair. So Aggravating virtue signaling ideologues use modern morals and values to vilify events and those in our past. They’re the kind of geniuses who ignorantly boast how they would’ve never been a Nazis in 1930’s Germany🙄
A “slave owning SOUTHERNER “ cuz we all know the North and rest of the WORLD are beyond virtuous and never had slaves EVER… and that those evil southerners were the last to participate never would’ve shed blood to end it EVER😵‍💫 OF BTW slavery still alive and well in 2022 and several parts of the globe are hacking each other up, openly off’ing gays and oppressing women as we speak… but yeah it’s the West who are uncivilized barbarians.
Any plans for more videos?
9:32 HEYYYYY THE ARROWS ON MY HOUSE
Hush Canada, you're in the arms of freedom and democracy

What happens to oversimplified he hasn’t uploaded in a few months
Smooth advertisement
LOL, if that senile old man is your commander in chief, we have nothing to worry. He will probably send the army the wrong way and you will invade mexico instead =P
26:07 😂😂😂
16:27 🤣🤣
Canada is selfish. They horde way too many hockey players up there. It’s bullshit. They actually sit around up there and debate as to whether or not they should add Hall of Famers to their Olympic team. Piss off. We have to resort to letting guys from Arizona play on our Olympic team.
TL;DR 2 nations almost went to war over a pig, and some guy with a YouTube channel wants to invade canada
0:47 biggest BRUH moment in US history
Can you please do the Spanish Inquisition?
That last bit OMG LMAO
You should do the Irish rebel
But just when is there going to be another vid
😂😂😂 bro what an ending. God bless America 🇺🇸
Hey mate are you gunna do a video on what happens in Ukraine ever
19:35 if you see it at 0.25 speed you can see the beating better
Biden is British OverSimplified
33:29
can you please post more?
hope you realize that canada has the world's largest uranium reserves and more than half of the team that developed the atomic bombs were canadian. so canada not having nukes is really a choice. so the whole 0 nukes vs 1300 something is not a good comparison, since canada literally builds most of the nukes and refined almost all the uranium used for american nukes and weapons if they went to war it would change completely
OVERSIMPLIFIEDDDDDD you should do a video on the Ukraine war. Yus
Afghanistan or Vietnam war oversimplified
Make a video 📹
A really good video would be the 7 years war
> comes in > posts "the pig was" > refuses to elaborate > leaves
You should make a video on the reformation
29:37 "They made me cry like a littile girl!, Wait NO, That makes me sound weak... They made me cry like a BIG girl!, yea that's it!!!" - By this I am pretty sure that General Harney had the right reputation about him!!!
You should make a titanic vid
33:59 and Canadian vibes were born
When new vid
And here where I live in Bellingham, Washington, we had a picketts bridge here in town. That is, until the Republican Party decided to publicly flirt with fascism at Charlottesville (before it decided to tie the knot on 1-6-21), and reminded the rest of us just how much we hate frickin' Nazis. The name was removed in 2019.
Man do a video on indian war of independence
i literally just learned what the manifest destiny was a week ago
29:19
Hey would you like to post another video soon?? Or at least send us our plushie?? Just asking to hard questions
Bro Nice Vid Stuart!

I literally watched all your content in 2 days and noticed that you might have hit puberty at the end of the video from the starting of this 1. Dang. You a child prodigy man.
oversimplified your lazy XD
This entire episode was just an elaborate ad for American annexation of Canada's provinces.  And I'm okay with that.
Fighting over lands that weren’t theirs to begin with…. God i hate politics.
Yessss let’s invade Canda 😈 lmao

As someone who lives really close to these islands (just a ferry ride away) and spent a semester in high school on leaning about this particular part of history. Some how you have gotten more correct and have offered more information then my history teacher could. Even if you’re “over simplified”
When is da next vid
Your content has come so far! Thank you for all the laughs and knowledge! You are straight up awesome!
Deadass when I was a Junior in HS 3 years ago I used these videos to pass AP US History
11:56 lol
I know that oversimplified’s content is more geared towards war and conflicts, but I liked his prohibition video and I think that it would be interesting to see more of that history
ideas for Oversimplified: Hamilton life story
Can you oversimplify the Philippine-American war?
Can you do the American-Mexican war?
Hi Oversimplified
This is my forth month waiting for another upload
He didn't post for awhile
Why has he not posted in 4 months, I miss him so much
33:24 is the best part and no one can tell me other wise
Can someone tell me, did Oversimplified changed at one point its narrator? Or is it just my perception?  thanks
Do the crusades
Hey can you do the Philippine American war?
imagine if "the shot heard around the world" was a man shooting a pig
2
I DECLARE WAR ON CANADA
I'm out of high school and this student still gives me my daily dose of history
I love how general Scott just shows up as a deus ex machina and fixes everything and Harney still does his damndest to fuck it all up.
man this stuffs hilarious its like if sam onella was better drawn had more videos and was more family friendly
I really wanted a RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE. canonically the doom slayer's bunny was killed by demons which has fueled his eternal fight against the demon hordes ever sense.  This is probably a lot worse.
New videos?
김지원 애니그만봐
Compared to Ukrainian invasion, the pig was minor..

Time for a Ukraine war oversimplified
Hey OverSimplified. I love the channel. Can you please do a video about something Latin America next?
7:28
37:08 God Bless the USA 🎉🎉👨‍🎤🤘🤘
You know I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden started a war with Canada just so people would forget about all of the problems right know it sounds like a very Warhawk thing to do like starting a stupid war in Iraq.     I maybe a Prussian Militarist, but even I ain’t dumb enough to be a Warhawk.
Why does james duglas have spots on his d*ck
do punic wars
Mr oversimplified , can you do a video about the Philippines?
Captain: I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT STARS A WAR. Crowd: My disappointment is inmensurable and my day is ruined.
lol
This video can be racist sometimes.
Great video, I would love to see one for the cultural revolution in china
I like how this entire conflict wouldn't have started if Lyman just built a complete fence.
Being a American * GUNS*
That manifest destiny bit had me dying lmao
I think that The Great northern war could be really intresting in your style
Please come back Oversimplified!
I’m confused at the racist implication here because many native tribes were our guides, allies, trade partners and friends (as seen in the cartoon here)..they were warring with other tribes..it’s not about hate it’s about power
33:23 was my favorite part, it got me laughing so hard
The Kerbal Space Program music at 12:23. Fantastic
this video is woke garbage
This video is so good, I could cry
This is a test comment, I am not a bot, reply if you want, I dont care
Peppered with plenty of progressive drivel.
That customs collector vs the sheep bit friggin killed me.

Oh god not Biden
37:17  Best part LOL
As an American that moved to canada the ending was exactly what I screamed out loud when I got to my new home my neighbours stared at me with so much confusion 😂
this video sucks it's 90% jokes and 10% actual history  XD... Napoleonic Wars was much better!
it took him 5 months + 13 days to make the 2 part - 1 hour - napoleonic wars but it took him over 6 months to make 38 minute pig war   oversimplified is hard to predict
Can you do Vietnam over simplified

Imagine being lifted by a basket onto a ship and traveling halfway around the world to learn a that the conflict that was started by a freaking pig and some potatoes.
Could you do something about ancient european/eurasia empires their timeline wars who fought and stuffs.
The two sides explaining the pig story skit doesn't even feel like they belong in this video. And I love it.
Weird question, can some one find out the name of the music that is playing when they are interviewing James Douglas? I need it for a project and I can't find it in the music credits oddly enough.
To be honest, as a Canadian, we were taught we technically won the war of 1812 because the enemy didn't achieve their objectives and we achieved ours.  But that's just what the textbook says so, take that with a grain of salt.
All I want for my birthday is a new Oversimplified video 🥺
this explains more then my high-school teacher ever did. lol not even brought up, even in College.
Can you please make a video on Irish history
Can you do a video on the war on terror of gulf war.

Is mayonnaise an instrument
OMG HOW HAVE I NOT NOTICED THE EASTER EGG: 15:40 IT'S A MAP OF VIETNAM.
The War of 1812.  The Americans, Canadians and British all say they won.  What they won was for everything to pretty much go back to what it was. Except for the Native Americans who were the big losers.  They were allied to the British and lost all their land. Big surprise.  Raise your hand if you have ever been screwed by the British.
When is the next video coming out
You should do a video on Alexander the great
3:37 DENSITY.
Best documentary ever lmfao I swear if a war ever gets started over a YouTube video I'm just check out.

To this day a lot of people in British Columbia regard the San Juan Islands as rightfully ours and are still pissed off about both this and the Alaska panhandle to this day. It's part of the reason BC usually comes out on top for being the most anti-American province as well as the most likely to vote the USA as a threat to world peace.

Believe in Jesus Believe who He say He is or what the Bible says He Is and Rely on Jesus as your Savior for He died for Your sins, so Rely on Him as Your Savior and your Forgiveness of Sins for we are Sinners. All of us are Going to Hell because of our Sins 1 sin can get you to Hell for Eternity, But God was Merciful and Gave His only Begotten son to die for our Sins on a Cross He was flogged, hit, spit upon and put on a crown of Thorn crushed in His skull and have to carry a Cross and was Crucified on it He had nails on His hands and Feet and God poured out His wrath on Jesus killing His own Son for our Sins. So if we Believe and Rely on Him we can Be Saved and spend Eternity in With Christ and God forever and Ever. And Have Joy in our Lives, Good days and Bad days. God and Jesus Loves us even how bad, wicked, cruel, sinful we are. And He is coming Back, Jesus is going to come back He is coming soon. Give your Life to Him and Receive Him as your Lord and Savior, Repent from your sins and ask for Forgiveness from God.Rely on Jesus as for your Forgiveness of Sins. Believe in Jesus Believe who He say He is or what the Bible says He Is and Rely on Jesus Trust Him.

“I didn’t say they were white people” 😂😂
Idea:The Punic Wars

Should do Russia vs Ukraine when it’s all over
37:20 watch your backs Canadians.
what if you did a vid about the philippine revolution that'd be cool i think
that ending was the most passionate i have ever heard oversimplified be, excellent oration
This was the first video of yours that I ever watched and it just so happened that at the same time we were learning about the pig war in history and surprisingly this is way more in depth than what we learned in history. Just goes to show how much more I've learned from YouTube than I've learned in school.
c'mon man....Vietnam oversimplified. been waiting for years....
In my whole life I've only just heard of war just because of PIG how ridiculous
Did general Scott actually beat the shit out of general Harney?
so.....as a non US citizen what i know from this video based in history, is that they were a messy combination of stubbornness, violence and a plage, i even felt bad for the brits, but thinking about it, the "American" people are actually bits descendant who were born in the USA so it's kinda sad bc eventually they overcomed the real "native American".
Actually they both owned islands the British own one half and the Americans owned the other, and the line spreader out a bit. So they both actually owned it.
Please next can you make the 100 year war
I rewatch this video from time to time because it's interesting, but also just how off the rails the ending is
I hope we get Vietnam Soon
H E S COMMING WITH A V E N G E A N C E
Do the war of terror
Amazing video. How about an OverSimplified video of the Hatfields-McCoys incident?
When will your next video be?
We burnt Toronto, the capital of upper Canada

Nord VPN man: *cassualy rips off His costume of a human*   American man: AYO WAIT YA KILLED A HUMAN?!?!
Please oversimplify the Indian war of independence or history of india
Anyone got their plushie yet?
Please do the Franco prussian war next
Moral of the story: don't tell oversimplified to make videos about your country
I normally love your stuff. I get there will be some jokes that won't land with some folks but jokes about being in love with pigs is bizarre I can't explain it but a little on the cringe side.. other than that I like most of your other videos.. especially your Al Capone: "WHOOOAAA!!"
what is this song?:  7:28
Can you please do the Whiskey War???
Now I wanna see a Mini War about 1812.

Ain’t this the truth

For OverSimplified, please add Indonesian subtitles because I am an Indonesian who understands English a little, sorry my English is bad because I use translate
It should have been britains islands
7:58 that was an all-star reference 😂i love it😂❤
Just wondering if someone were to use your particular art style, the squarish bodies, circle faces, jet black eyes, general cuteness, to create similar content, that would not be okay, right?
Oversimplified provoking war for content, genius.
That ending section though about biden! lmaooo
19:33 I don't know why he scream and hit lyman was so funny
okay be real with me , do you think you’re only getting recommended these videos now cause of the russia — ukraine conflict going on ? cause i have been recommended these ever since it started 👏🏻👏🏻
18:30 i coudnt stop laughing
Wtf is “timed beta”? Well anyways…. I TOTALLY F’ing CALLED THAT PROMO! This is the secret to advertising, make people feel special for guess when it’s about to happen so they feel obligated to watch without skipping ahead
Hi uh, I’ll have a large pizza with Chinese Civil War video, European Age of Exploration video, and extra Vietnam War video.
Hi oversimplified, I’m not sure if you ran out of ideas or it’s just taking you several months for a new video but I have an idea: The Genpei civil war which took place in Japan in the 1500s there is a Netflix show and of course a Wikipedia but please do it I’m a big fan of Japanese history btw.
Oversimplified is the only channel that can take a topic that Noone has ever heard of And make it into an entertaining 40 Minute video
Bro can you do Vietnam war? Pls
Bro this guy makes world hated events funny
I NEED THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION!!!!
The date is March 31st. We need more videos. Too long. That being said your vids are entertaining and educational too which is nice. Thank you for making them
U don't talk about Thailand enough in other vids pls do more invietname war ty
Huh
A few video suggestions from myself and other viewers:  Apartheid Roman Empire/Julius Caesar Alexander the Great  Vietnam/Korea war  Mexico-USA War of 1846 Mongol Empire Balkan Wars Colonisation Seven Years War Austro-Prussian War The 30 years war,  Martin Luther and the Reformation  The USA civil rights movement The Taiping rebellion (Jesus Brother) India independence Franco-Prussian War Chinese Dynasties Persian Empire Hussite Rebellion The Persian Gulf War Chinese Civil War (the last one by now) The Crimea War The Viet-Mongol War (3 times) Banana War Three Kingdoms Of Korea The Black Dealth Pandemic The Reconquista The Japanese-Mongol war (twice)  I’ve already studied most of these but I think these would make funny/interesting videos. I might even learn more that I didn’t know about! I don't usually ask for likes but If you are an Oversimplified viewer reading through this list make sure to give it a like to increase the chance of Oversimplified seeing it. Also feel free to give more suggestions on what I can add to the list :)
When we getting the Punic Wars?
Rose of pig walker
This to me proves that Imperial Germany was best Germany. Long Live the German Empire, Long Live the Kaiser, Gott mit uns
34:55 wait… why aren’t the confederates shooting as well?
Those islands should be Canadian... (I definately don't say this just cause I'm Canadian 🤫)
Europeans fighting over land that does not belong to them.  😆
RIP the pig. But don't worry. Peace is temporary, WAR is forever!
It was pretty clear from the actions and lack of sharpness of Pickett and Harney what side they would end up on the civil war...

I want to see Vietnam War Oversimplified
weird things in the vid: 1. the video says "some believed it was a destiny given to them by God himself" the united states says "it's my DENSITY" 2. when the people go outside they shoot at some bulls, place a bunch of rails and ride on choo-choo trains, and place an entire McDonalds
37:17
USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
man if history class had this kind of comedy in it i imagine history professors would be a more prevalent carrier choice
Could you do The Vietnam war?
We like to see the phillipine revolution because theres many Filipino people in you're community
In around 20 years oversimplified will get some good content
it feels like the americans were the bad ones
*casually loads canadian rifle*

Come on over, it's been 3 months. Don't make me wait till June. Cause that would be...... Uncool.
He makes history lectures more funny but still informational
Sometimes the people in the past were just so stupid I love watching it😂😂😂
37:08 watch out Canada Biden is coming to get you!
I do like how the British just decided to remove flag pole just to annoy the Americans
Vice-President Harris, the Time has come, execute Order Invading Canada
Hi oversimplified! Would you make a video in the future about the rise of fascism in Japan? I think this is an overlooked historical event and many schoolbooks don’t even mention it, which is quite unfair because Japan had such an important role in influencing Asia, mainly China, where many atrocities were committed. Thank you for reading and continue doing such a good work with sharing us the history of our world!
Do a Ned Kelly video pls
OverSimplified gotten a idea for you the yugoslavian fall
Make video about 🇷🇺 🇺🇦
🤣
can you make a video about cesar

Is there going to be a video on the Ukraine war soon?
ukraine simplified??
Dude, when are you having a new video? They're so good!
You should do the Haitian revolution next
You should do a video on the Sengoku Jidai period of Japanese history
to be honest i think biden would actually lose the war against Canada
Clarification:  there is a San Juan Island AND it is within the islands which are called the San Juan Islands as well as within San Juan County, if there was any confusion. BTW:  these islands are worth the visit!  For bicycling, definitely check out Lopez Island and to get into the rain shadow, Orcas Island is great too!
Would love a recap on the current situation
It won’t
8:22 despite there only being 22 states at the time, there is 35 stars on each flag.
We need a Roman Empire - Oversimplified
This story might not be big as WW2, WW1, or Napoleon's War. But most hilarious simplified video to me.
Ya, baybeh we want a war. America vs Canada
The passion in that ending bit! His narration has come a LONG way since his first video.
where's new videooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

First time i reached the end of this video, AND HEARD THIS WONDERFUL VOICE FROM THIS WONDERFUL MAN XD
This was basically a race of who could get more of there people in Oregon

You not even make Cambodia for I have new over complicated but they khmer but better for me you are not

Well that was a storm in a teacup. And in the every ounce of Canadian politeness they forfeited their claim to the island regardless of how underhanded Americans tactics were.
fun and educative
Hey Oversimplified can you do a video on the Irish Revolution? from 1918-1923
Somewhere in future: Russian Wars 2022

The ending was so funny!! As a Canadian, it’s nice that we have the good stereotypes of nice, cold, and maple syrup, which is on the better side of stereotypes.
You should do the Chinese revolution nexr

I love these videos they are so funny and entertaining
I think you should cover the English civil war. That would be cool
Jesus Christ I never realised how pathetic the cause of these wars were
As a person that lives in vancouver,i approve of this video
This is literaly most intresting american war...

NO don’t do it you imbecile don’t invade Canada it’s a stupid idea 37:14
Both stole the land and fight each other
Please More Update 🙏
Just thought I'd point out that James Douglas was not white as depicted in this video. His father was Scottish, but his mother was "free coloured" Guyanese, i.e. he was half white, half black, in contemporary parlance.
There was a khmer version of oversimplicated the channel call overcomplicated
Oversimplified always finds a clever way to add a NordPN sponsor in his vid
18:25 I found Technoblade
i like how florida was the dick of america lmao
I have a weird feeling his next video will be about the war that happened in Afghanistan or the current Russo-Ukrainian war in a few months if the war is over.
3:32 Florida
You need to hire more people!!! This has become bigger than a gig. You could literally have a huge company!
I need more man!!! You are literally the best story teller or historian I have ever listened to. I enjoy all of your videos thoroughly.

Please make a video about the war from Vietnam (1961-1975) or from Afghanistan (1979-1989)
Can you make a video about the Bosnian war
It's almost like through it's whole history US was ruled by absolute imbeciles or people with crazy ideas and then somehow they manage to actually make em real.
The next video could you do the war of 1812
7:13 censor it 😂
Suggestion: The Turkish War Of Independence.
I d love to see the Greek Revolution of 1821!
Meanwhile in Europe:

Oversimplified is an amazing voice actor in his videos.
You should make a video of Mao zedong

Pls alexander the great
Can you please do “Alexander Hamilton - oversimplified” THAT WOULD BE AMAZING
Can you please drop another video
1:28 bruh was that a history matters reference??
George Pickett is remembered for something else in America history
At 27:26, you can see the islands change from blue to red. It's a very subtle detail, but it makes the whole video a lot better  Nvm, just took a closer look, the islands just remained blue
Make video about Yugoslavia history
I think a good video to do would be, would be on the Cambodian Civil War and the ensuing Cambodian Genocide as I think some attention to the war would be nice, as I feel as if it’s not noticed and recognized enough in modern history
Vietnam war pls
do more like Roman war
Your videos are so funny and am I the only one who thinks that this might just be exactly how the people and characters of history spoke. And your videos yet are full of facts and I came to know a lot about World History by watching your videos. Thank you Oversimplified. Also this is my request to you that can you make a video on the life of Queen Elizabeth I of England.
Amerinada lol 😂
"The Troubles-Oversimplified"  or  "The Irish Famine of 1845-Oversimplified"  *P l e a s e*
Ukraine and Russia war next

Hahahaha the introduction to Nord VPN made me laugh.  Saw this coming XD
Love these videos. Always cheers me up 😂😂
That last part... oh my
Can you do a video about the war where Paraguay lost 90% of its male population after your new video/videos comes out?
Canadez?
That is the best ending i have ever seen
Doing a video about the Vietnam war would be pretty cool and informative!!
How is this 3 months old
As an American i can confirm that if you see a McDonald’s in the distance that it’s American territory
Hated the ending.
Lol I live just outside of the island and I’m laughing that this gave me more information about the pig war then local history, thank you this was awesome
Hey OVERSIMPLIFIED. Can you do the great northern war?
Suggestion:Vietnam war
I mean America is the most racist country in the world and that's not a theory that's a fact lol 😆
hey when this possible WWIII ends between ukraine and russia you should do a simplified ver of it.

As a Canadian I welcome US annexation
5:52 what in muffin is going on

I don’t like this Lyman guy, he builds on land that animals graze, doesn’t even make an adequate fence area, THEN KILLS SOMEONE ELSE’S PIG EVEN THOUGH ITS HIS FAULT THE POTATO WAS EATEN
Dude make a video on swedish kingdomx

It feels like a year since you upoaded
basically history but fun
I miss you. New content please
Oversimplified what the heck happened to ur voice?! Ur voice used to b so emo! But now u sound like an actual history teacher! (No offence)
the ending is what a mental breakdown looks like
and on 2022, the world blew up, napoleon's head got too big
Please create a video on Indian history too.
I love history. I love dark comedy. I love oversimplification for humor sake. I do not love waiting 6 months for a video. The quality justifies the wait for sure, I just wish it was faster. Maybe time to hire a team of animators? College kids work for cheap.
I wonder what the first video of 2022 will be?
Sick video and nice ending dawg. God bless america, eh?
I got a D+ on my paper. Turns out American settlers did _not_ use Nord VPN.  Just kidding! They did use it, I'm pretty sure.   I fully expect commercials will be in  American classrooms, eventually. Textbooks will have McDonald's ads, or an Illustration of George Washington crossing the Delaware, holding a Big Gulp. The school bus has Nike ads on the sides. Crossing guards wear GEICO Insurance billboards.  I get it tho... it's better than everyone working in a factory.
I want to see doen fall of mugal empire and british occupation over india and then india and pakistan, it would call for  a series of its own and really make me happy :)
Ayo why Pickett look like gun jesus
show the cities that defended themselves in the world war, and the partisans the true liberators of German slavery in Europe.
When’s the next video Sam’onella I miss you
I want Oversimplified as a History teacher.
Vietnam War when????
It's 11:10 for m,😂😂😂
16:02 oh those Russians 😂😂😂
Hey oversimplified can you do a simplify of the war of syria because I’m in syria
He made a great point at the end there
Hi oversimplified, please could you cover the Boer war. I often find that not many people know much about South Africa and it's history, which is a shame.
Why hasn't he been posting
How does he learn this stuff
The British removed the flag pole from the island had me 💀
The only thing Biden is doing with a vengeance is fucking up our own country and shitting his pants in public. !!!!!!!!FJB!!!!!!!
Make on Nationalism in india...plzz 😭😭
We know what war he is doing next it just has to finish
Pig looks like waddles from gravity falls
It would be cool if you did Persian Wars.
I think it’s time for a fall if the ussr to present day invading Ukraine video

For any Canadian that are actually afraid of America invading Canada, Don't worry, America is just a weak dying country and it will stay that way for as long president brain dead is in office.
what the hail
Next video should be about Genghis Khan and the Mongol empire
We locals don’t say “San Hwan” with a proper Spanish “h” sound when referring to our islands. We say “San Wan.” San Juan in Puerto Rico has the “h” sound, but not in Washington State. 😉
Oversimplified can you do the history of Uzbekistan thank you love your videos
Hey oversimplified you should try doing the civil rights act
It would of been a good video if you would of left out what you thought was funny. In fact your supposed funny was extremely annoying

You should make a video on The Korean War, The Vietnam War, and the Battle of 1812.
Why is everyone a sellout these days? Youtube has ads, and then you have ads in the video too... don't any of you have any values??
You intellectual unit of a dude, please can we have a crusades video (any crusade, just a crumb of a crusade please)
Are you gonna do an oversimplified Russia ukraine war?
When is the next video bro
I'm sorry but "Darth Pig-ious" on the thumbnail is hilarious! 😂

The ending reminds me so much of Carl’s Jr. Most American Burger
We need to wait 3. More months 😐
America🇱🇷

Hi oversimplify have you tried the Haitian revolution or the Haitian Independence
3:53 “I thought it was Sharon’s cat” “I hear voices all the time” 🤣
I wish I had videos like these when I was in school. I remember we had to watch some guy sitting in his room talking about history for an hour. Now im here at 20, learning about history on my own.
Awesome content, framework and evolving 👌 Should I dare you make one about Portugal? The topic may be the one you enjoy the most, there’s plenty of History to choose 😁
this animation is crazy!!!
U guys should look at the small text/fast scrolling text. It’s really funny
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do Russia and Ukraine pls
Are you going to do anything about you know what’s going on now when it’s over?
Nice jobs,thanks share
Ayo, my class is studying the Vietnam War... *Slides $20*

26:04 I like pickett's face.
"Oh no " 16:29
The next video: Ottoman Empire 👀✅🔥🔥 Just a suggestion ☕💞
now I'm not from the US, which means I ditent understand the beginning"i didn't say they were white people"  is it because whites are too strong militarily, that the US could not expand, or do people in the US think whites have rules about not attacking whites. And then the US goes to war with canada which is full of white people. Just a US jok far from reality?
BRITISH OWNS THE WORLD
Buuuuuut… i am canadien ;-(

I like how with everything in this video, the pig is the most detailed for a while. It makes total since
O Canada! Our home and native land! True piggy love in all of us command.
I honestly think it is A LOT more likely that the US will invade Mexico instead of Canada.  (I know it’s a joke.)
Lol
Where is the Vietnam war
imagine it being the 1800s in the pacific north west and youre "running out of room" lol
18:31 anyone else fixated on the laughter from the guy seeing this?
Ideas: Alexander The Great conquest, Texas Revolution, Mexican Revolution, Mini-war: Roman empire vs Barbarians, Mexican-American War.
Was that actually Morgan Freeman?
Please do something on ottoman empire 🥺☹️🤌🏻
I’m Canadian

OverSimplified can't wait to make a video about russia ukraine war Imfao
I hope that the next video will be about the Great Northern War, it is fairly unknown but has a lot to tell.
Could you try and do a rail disaster as a video and the events causing it as well as the aftermath.
must be hyped about the Ukraine Russia conflict. new video must be on the way
When new vid i watched this 68 times
Yeah invade canda usa it's not like we have literally 10 times more allies and peace treaties
This is history at its most biased and worthless state. When you put your own spin on events to paint the picture that makes you feel like a good person. Wonder how those western tribes got so big? A 3 day meeting was held to try and unite the western tribes against expansion, yet they could not get past the decades of massacres by larger tribes as they enslaved and butchered smaller tribes.  Oh, and where’s the part where you mention that the Cherokee had slaves on the Trail of Tears? Or does that not fit the narrative.  This what happens when you regurgitate virtue signaling history with major omissions, instead of understanding that human history is complicated and never so cut and dry. This take is painfully short sighted and misinformed. It’s a shame so many will be misinformed as a result
1369 sheap. Nice
7:57
0:32 there is Russia YOU DON'T COME TO RUSSIA, RUSSIA COME TO YOU YOU DON'T COME TO RUSSIA, RUSSIA COME TO YOU YOU DON'T COME TO RUSSIA, RUSSIA COME TO YOU YOU DON'T COME TO RUSSIA, RUSSIA COME TO USA!

In thought Canada was allies with the 🇺🇸
lmao I love how you sang the song the just kept comin'
I clapped when you announced the Islands' American Citizenship. My life would not be the same without them!  I grew up in Seattle, and loved weekend ⛴  and 🌞 summer ⛴  ferry trips to the San Juan Islands, they are awesome. This is such a cool piece of history! The way you tell stories, your expressive vocal nuances, AND consistently make good jokes is a gift from the heavens. ☁️ 😇  I'm determined to take my kids back there this year,  and your taling 🐖 of the Pig War is the muse this traveling artistry. We have a black mini pig, he can come along to pay his porcine respects. 🐖 🐷 🐽 🐗
7:56 all stars
On Native America Day, we honor how badly the natives got beasted on, and celebrate their eternal butthurt.
We were all sad to see Canada annexed, but it did however lead to Fallout 1, so it wasn't all bad.

We need a WW1 and WW2 Remaster

Coming soon Ukrainian vs Russia
I love ur vids. You always make my day :)
Did anybody else catch the foreshadowing? The plans on the table has a map of Vietnam. I assume, because of this little detail, that Oversimplified’s next video will be on Vietnam.
This is the stuff on YouTube I love the most. I as a american would never had know or even heard about this if it wasn't for Oversimplified. Great stuff I always look forward to more vids.
cant wait for the russia v s nato oversimplified
We the canadians are freindly BUT STRONG
I'LL EAT YOUR EYES!!!!!!!!

If this channel has taught me anything it’s how the British love their islands in the middle of nowhere

7:53
Thats the smoooooothest Nord VPN add ive seen in my entire life

GOD BLESS AMERICA 🇺🇸
Talk about  canada 🇨🇦!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All of your videos are very good and thanks to you I've learned so much. I'm from Greece, and I'd like to see a video about the revolution on 1821 and some of the Balkan wars
I think the funniest part was "bidens coming baby".
A good idea for a video is the greek revolution 1821-1830
U-S-eh?
Considering how bad its been for the entire world not just America under biden, canada should be worried😂
I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Had me laughing from start to finish.

The Americans keep coming  and they don’t stop coming they hopped into their wagons and hit the ground running. The best quote ever
Fan fact toothbrush was invented by Egypt in the 5000bc

As a Canadian, I would rather not get invaded by an American. Also, maple syrup will NEVER be an American product. If I have to kill a man to live, or kill a man to keep maple syrup Canadien, the syrup lives...
Lol. The only thing Biden is coming to is American children. I'd honestly like to see usa try.
I think Winfield Scott would approve of the portrayal of him beating the snoot out of Harney

Oversimplified, can you do a video on the Balcan wars. I think it would be a good video cous the balkans had a very interesting history under the outomen empire. Also, your videos are very fun and interesting. Keep up the good work.

It would be cool to see a video on the great heathen army
Half of the nordvpn stuff was lies

Nord vpn:changed to north korea on netflix (Everything is blocked.)
F*** this racist shit.  Natives were savages who would wait for any arbitrary reason to break peace and kill/scalp settlers. 3x as many settlers died.  Name one thing Native Americans contributed to global society...I'll wait.

I think the Korean War or Mexican-american War would be a cool topic for a video keep up the good work love your videos
Well, this is not really a war, more like a near-war incident. If we consider this to be a war then the Vela incident in 1962 should be a war as well
Jolly Rotten!

"Pickett graduated dead-last in his graduating class"  At West Point, that cadet is called The Goat, and is actually more respected than the guy who came in second; The Goat had to calculate the exact bare minimum amount of work needed to graduate and no more, and it was widely recognized that he could've graduated first of the class if he wanted to.
Do Austria silver war with  hungry
This episode had too many jokes
At 3:32 it looks like America gets a boner in Florida
Hey man can you make a video about the Greek revolution or civil war?
I do wonder why you mentioned the irredentist movement in the USA to annex Canada?
hey man you should make a video about the vikings
Oh, I see... So that's how it is, uh? That's how it's going to be, is it? That's the way in which things are, eh? That be how it will, is it? Will it be how that is, huh? That be the way in which things be the way they are, is i- GET OFF MY PROPERTY!
I know the last part was a joke, but I seriously raged.  The Canadian military is viewed as weak, but we have better trained soldiers and better vehicles. We just don’t have the numbers you Americans do.
If u can see dis oversimplified pls can u do a Irish war of inapendance pls
As a Canadian I found the ending funny
losses+capital building burnt down= definitely not a failure but a draw.
You should make a Russo Japanese war video

Hi man I love your channel !  In your video “ the Cold War “ you hinted the Vietnam war. I was wondering if you were going to make that video soon. Have a great Day 😃
alternate title: oversimplified talks about a almost nearly created war and then goes insane about canada`s existance
Wow the USA settlers are just complete immoral savages
The ending 😂😂😂
Hey what about the American 🇺🇸 Mexican war
16:27
7:25
Did he pump a double barrel, breach loaded shotgun...? Not to mention they have hammers 😅😂😂😂😂
USA AY USA AY
I just started watching this because the title had me geeking out. But then I started watching it and saw the explanation for Manifest Destiny and how the Americans crashed the British party with rifles and ish. Then I lost it even more. In the best way possible.   This channel has a great way of explaining things in the videos.   I love the animation style.   Keep the videos coming.
It's like OverSimplified's videos get better and better. Hands down an S-tier channel.
Please don't ever stop making videos.
…Belgium owns the islands
A new peak for funny for the series
BRUHH I  CANADIAN IM OFFENDED
OverSimplified you ok because it sounds like you’re on some drugs in most of this video
As a Canadian, I feel offended and personally attacked.  I think he lost it at the end though
Just had a history test about this
31:03
Canda Fuck Yeah!
Please make a History of India Video
Where's this man when you need him? Please oversimplify the war on Ukraine
2:13 "Don't blame the founding fathers , blame the guy who made it" 😂

Can you do that or not
Can you do the dream SMP war from the beginning all the way to Tommy in it and tubbo and battle with dream
My history class show your video.
This is all fine and well, but not exactly how the U.S./Canada border was settled. You’ve forgotten The Great and Bloody Arroostook War, across the continent, where the border was wrongly despised and much — nay, verily, unto ALL — of New Brunswick, and some of Quebec, rightly belongs to the Sovereign State of Maine.
This video suck and just move here
Instead of destiny, they said density, lol.
Next video: the Russian Ukraine war 🇺🇦 (Btw i support Ukraine )
A bit of a request for a video but can you do the queen annes war?
Bulgarian wars?
Ok so idea, what if you did a story about the El Salvadoran civil war? I’m El Salvadoran so I think that would be super cool and would love to learn more about what actually happened.❤️
do the mongolian empire and 100 years war
Chricky the more things change the more they stay the same. Its American strategy today
Are you gonna make one on ancient europe
Oversimplifie Finlands winter war
I have an idea for your next video, I don't know about the 7 years war, and so maybe that can be you next video or pt1 and pt2 video
When he mentioned “affordable insulin” my heart sinked as a type 1 diabetic😭
"Now let's go out there and make the world a better place."  *B-2A Spirit thunders in the distance*
18:39 what, how does he reload?
That ending was glorious.  But as a Canadian I'm also scared for me life now.
Hello OverSimplified, I’m a very big fan, and was wondering if you had plans to make a video about the Spanish Civil War.
Gosh! I’m really glad I’m not a Canadian, after watching those final few minutes there...
Can u make a Russian Ukraine war one when it’s done

I feel like Oversimplified has covered most of the modern history, how about we go back to the OGs ? The medival ages, the crusades, the holy roman empire and Genghis Khan ? That would be amazing.
This guy is hilarious!
7:57 sounds like a song

Technically the British and the american only jointly occupied the north side of the Columbia river, and south side of the 49th parallel, north of the 49th parallel was definitely british, south of the columbia river was definitely american
7:50 "but the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the grounds running... " lol
best outro ever lol
Because if USA did, canadas a NATO member, so it would be free for everyone to take them over, they would be kicked out, and the president will get arrested
“Jizzingham”😂
Hey oversimplified can you do a viking video ?
Are you gonna do an episode on ancient Europe
Cant wait for him to do a vid about ukraine and russia
We can ALWAYS invade Canada and make it the 51st we just don't want to
Still wish I can hear about the vietnam war.
I honestly thought this was going to be about the Hatfields & McCoy feud since it started over the ownership of a pig. Something that Oversimplified should definitely cover.
Video idea: opium wars oversimplified
So when is “Oversimplified-The Russian invasion of Ukraine”?

Great vid but you've said lord piddlingham is shown in the house of commons (green benches) as lords are not allowed here and instead should be in the house of lords (red benches)
Make new videos
i hope that after it all ends we are going to have a good "Russian invasion in Ukraine" episode
You guys at oversimplified should do a mini wars video on the cod wars. I just read about it and thought it would be an interesting video to see.
I Hope your next video is on the Vietnam war. Do it or I will slap you
I think you should either do stuff with the indians or try out the time before Christ (bc) for the Spartans or something
You guys should do the 7 years war at some point. Pleaseeeeeee🥺🥺

This has nothing to do with the video, but excuse me 3 months has FLOWN by. This is one of those channels where I will literally watch the day of and do it as soon as I can.
Obviously we’re going to need a Ukraine Russia War OverSimplified once the invasion is over
As a Canadian, No.
It would be cool Oversimplified videos of the following topics: - The Crusades  - Rome (From the monarchy to the empire) - Inca Empire
Hilarious ending.
Why not the German revolution?
Still waiting for the United States of North America
Hands down this is my favourite channel
In the video were the British empire (lead by the Pigerator) and the American Rebelium (lead by George Washinmachine)  - A very good start of the Pig wars series 10/10   - Shuld earn a Luis (Oscar)  -and also could you do a video about swizerland (cuz you know im swiss thank you :)
That pig must’ve really been important
Its funny to think Americans and British were once enemies
3:38 hey yo that’s the same tune as in bee swarm simulator when u use the lid art (Roblox)
O look a ukrain war
So Oversimplified, your telling me if Lyman built a 4 sides of his fence, none of this would’ve happened?
XD  31:02
Hey man,can you make videos on Indian history plzzzz

Who said it was Sharon’s cat
Please make more videos oversimplified. You know how to make boring history subjects enjoyable and entertaining. Could your next videos focus on the iraq war or vietnam war, Either way your videos are great

Waiting for Russia and Ukraine 😂
bro died
America doesn't invade countries we defend the countries that are being invaded. Usually
dude, you have absolutely no idea how many times you’ve saved me on a test… I would fr learn everything in less than 2 hours before school because your videos are so damn additive and worth watching. You have the dates listed, all of the details.. everything that i’ve found so boring in school you made me want to learn more about, and i’m really really grateful for that :)
No , the 1812 wars was a complet defeat for the usa , you guys try to raid canada and get your ass wipe
18:15 I know the text says a man AND his potato, but you can't help but notice the subtitles say IN his potato. Of course now that brings up a lot more questions, like how this potato of his has human features and sentience, really got to wonder what he's been using to fertilize that ground of his.
But the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon when the brits more than 6-1 xaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxa!
I will sleep with one eye open but I think we should more worry about Russian and Ukraine
I’m so kissed that I didn’t know this came out
Mcdonalds, Thompson SMGs  and B2 Bombers, God Bless America

if you do an oversimplified 1971 war of Bangladesh, you're likely to get views from a whole country. But if you do one on Indian Brexit you'll get views from a continent, and if you do one on the afghan amrexit you'll get views from the whole Muslim World
Please do one on Iraq war, Afghanistan war, Middle east crisis, Indo-pak wars, and 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh...  please please please Oh and the bloody dividing of india and Bangladesh in 1947

Ok yankees you guys should focus on Pacific because Xi is coming by Avengers + Dark Universe.

22:18 funny story that in 1859 Panama Canal hasn't been built yet so the letter path is completely wrong.

What is this ending
Dude, I love your videos so much. Keep up the good work. Hope you get more content from the War in Ukraine.

Ukrainian War - OverSimplified
Pls do one on history of Ukraine!

BIDENS COMING BABY
Do the Battle of the Alamo
By all means this was a very well written and designed video. I mean it was really entertaining but I can't help but feel like the historical event this video is based on just wasn't the right pic. Assuming most viewers are north american it kinda makes sense, but still, I hope you guys takle more relevant stuff again like the opium war, apartheid, the algerian war or the Haitian revolution for instance.
The only casuality was just a pig? Oh ok OS... we're supposed to just completely forget about Spuddy?? I guess we know whose side you've been on the whole time. Disgraceful!
Because White people would never…fight against other White people…
The most funniest part for me is in 33:28
7:57
The ending got me XDDD
Anyone else in here during russiaxukraine war thinking about if oversimplified will do a video on it someday
After this whole mess in Ukraine is over, hopefully with Russia defeated, please do a video about it, Russia's stupidity will stand for a great comedic content!

Don’t you do it
Hey I was curious if you can do a history of the polish Soviet war of to 1919 to 1920
Make ukraine war
I just realized that the U.S. didn't say "It's my destiny", she said "It's my density"!
I wish I could have gotten that plush. 😔Please put it back on sale!!!
Man he’s so mean now.
He’s gonna make a Ukraine one in the future
Ukraine and russia next? It can be intresting too
Joe is a Putz!
Nice social justice warrior implication and misinterpretation of U.S. history. Such a shame. These used to be accurate and informative.
7:27
The original calculation of taxes on the calculator actually spells "boobies" upside down, a time honored tradition amongst American math students in primary school everywhere
Sometimes you sound like vanossgaming

Oversimplified I just found out a YouTuber I followed is being copyrighted from watching your videos, and being threatened with a strike,  the only reason I know you  exist, is  because of YouTubers reacting to your videos.  As of right now I will no longer be supporting or watching any of your videos.

The scene where Casey tells Harney not to put Pickett back on the island had me in tears 🤣
As the Americans entered the British camp to raise their flag, they found that the British had removed the flagpole 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It'd be nice to have a video about the Mexican war of Independence.

Invading... I mean... Liberating Canada sounds good. End the crazy mandates more freedom. I don't know.
@15:50 Does anyone else hear kerbal space program music?

I think that Great Northern War or Prussian Unification of Germany (1815-1871) would be interesting.
Next video Russian vs Ukraine. But pls recognize that Ukraine is also very much in the wrong

Mans is waiting for the war to be over, to make a bid
Congrats on 6 mil!
My children love all of the Over Simplified videos. They really want one helping to understand what the hell is going on right now in Ukraine. I know it is not an easy thing to create one of these but they were asking me to ask!

I just wating for the ukraine vs russia video
*sigh* Well as you have seen in the news looks like you've got another video to make.
do "russian invasion of ukraine Oversimplified" please
Lol that ending was epic. And now with the rights trampling of Canada latley they just might want us to. Lol jkjk
ok stuart. Canada is too insignificant to you Isn't it. We will see in July 22 2022 when canada with the join force of britain takes over the baltic states in retaliation to Russia's invasion of the middle east. We will see then, Stuart.
Question: and who was it that spoke to god?  Someone's answer: I thought it was Shearon's cat
Can you do the russia ukraine crisis pls
Siege of Peking next
Please do Russia and Ukrainian
I cannot wait for oversimplified to go over the invasion of Ukraine from Russia. Help me understand please.
how about the history of the Soviet Union.
Love the videos.  I hope you would consider a topic idea--  The abrahamic religions and where they divide.  Also if you look at just christianity after the reformation/protestant break off, it then goes into a million different sects.  the wiki hole I fell into was so confusing.  I immediately came here. to check if you had any videos on the subject.   I think a lot of people would benefit knowing where the centuries long fighting is all about.
rip technoblade
As a Canadian the ending to this video is true, y’all would beat our ass but also pls don’t because I have funny memes I could send you I swea-
WHY ARE U NOT MAKING VIDEOS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You should make a story about the Russian and Ukraine fight
Oversimplified there’s a WW3 you should make a video on it
Is it just me or is literally every single one of his videos are sponsored by either NordVPN or Skillshare?
You have to make a video about the Russian Civil War.🇪🇪🙃❄
Make a history video of netherlands, why? Why not! I mean its underrated!
Are you gonna make a video about liberty War?
Make a video about the Kuwaiti wars before and after being independent
Do the Mexican American war because that is an underrated war and barely talked about. Thanks
I just realized, dude came outside going "HEY, STOP THREATENING MY SHEEP". No threat was made in english, so this implies that he too can understand and speak to the sheep. Not that it's particularly important, just funny. Edit: Just realized that they BAAAAA at eachother a little bit later. No implication needed. Derp.
By far the best episode by the channel (so far)
Upcomming: Oversimplified - Russo-Ukrainian War of 2022 (The Donbass War)
Well, now you have a current war happening. Can you PLEASE do a special cover up serie about it?! Would be amazing to follow and inform everyone  Here you have an amazing opportunity.  Cheers
so uh  when russo-ukrainian war dropping?
The one person I thought would never be named in an OverSimplified video was Wayne Gretzky. Turns out I was wrong.
PLEASE DO THE PUNIC WARS I BEG
17:45
THIS WAS AWESOME ! (AlittleBitOfAWeirdEnding.... but AWESOME !)
Can you do a video about Otto Von Bismarck
will this guy every show up again, hope he does.
OverSimplified should do make a video of the Vietnam War. I loved this video. absolutely hilarious lmao
Hey Oversimplified, can you please do the Thirty Years War? I saw other historians do it on YouTube but it was pretty boring.
Oversimplified when is the Vietnam war oversimplified(I know it was probably a prank but still)
What if that actually happens
Hey dude Don't forget to explain Russia Ukraine war  !!!
DONATE MEARCH TO MRBEast
Oversimplified where you at the world's about to end
In a few years or decades a new video will be called "The invasion of Ukraine"
would you do the russian-ukrainian war when it ends ??????????????????????????????????????????
I bet biden remembers being there
Can you summarize the Vietnam War (1955-1975)
Oh god!!!!! Godbless USA🇺🇲🇺🇲
Do Philippines plsssss pretty plssss
Do a video on ww3
End was a bit over the top lol
A war just from a pig and some little islands.
funniest history ever
CONGRATS ON 6MILLION SUBS OVERSIMPLIFIED!!! YOU’RE FANBASE GROWS DAILY.
Hands down the greatest outro in YouTube history.
Let’s move to Ancient History and Stone Age History
Post a video now
Kan you make one about ukarine and russia?
Bruh!! It has been ages since you uploaded a new video
I can't wait for ww3 oversimplified (part 1)
But for real we should actually invade and liberate Canada and make them American states. That would be dope.  The idea that Biden would be able to stay awake long enough to even give an order to invade is laughable though.
It’s actually kind of comforting to know the US have had many idiots as generals since the beginning but there was always a few good ones to stop them from destroying the country.
UKRAINE - RUSSIA WAR EXPLANATION PLEASE!
next episode: the russo-Ukraine war
Congrats for 6 million subs 🎉
have you considered doing a world war III video? or RU-UK video?
When we need him the most, he disappears 😪😪
Love your videos man, please do one on indean mordern history i have exams coming ❤️
USA and Canada are pretty chill and for ppl that think we don’t have nukes we do we just don’t use them
That ending was the only time I heard emotion from him ever.
Best animation ever
He should really do Gaius Julius Caesar
The fact that so much happened just because a pig died-😩
So we’re going to need oversimplified Ukraine-Russian conflict, or better known as a possible ww3
You know, when you think about it, once we reclaim Canadian territory as sovereign American soil for our Manifest Destiny, we need to take a look South of the Border... because there shouldn't BE a border. It's already called Central and South AMERICA, which means it should all belong to US! Trump was a fool, trying to build a wall, why would we want to block off our OWN sovereign manifest destiny!?!?
where’s canada
you don’t talk about canada enough
Love this.
Can’t wait for the invasion of Ukraine video to drop
Notice how the attitude changes away from all the imperialism jokes as soon as he talks about Canadian westward expansion….. I smell bias
5:57
Holy cow things went from 0 to 100 real frickin quick at the end
Do the war on drugs
the ending scared me :(
That American guy would’ve argued with the British guy
Look where Florida at 😂 3:37

Hey dude, you should make a video about the Toledo War, it was a state war between Michigan and Ohio over a disputed Territory called Toledo, in the end, Ohio got Toledo while Michigan got the Upper Penisula (which is why it's part of Michigan and not Winscosin), and one thing, if you put colors, make Michigan red and Ohio blue (I just randomly chose)

Oversimplified just taught me something not even my teacher knows
I know it was a joke (a very funny one) but I got to thinking about why doesnt USA invade Canada? So many reasons starting with: 1. It never occurs to us because... why? Don't wanna. 2. We know they don't like us very much (for very understandable reasons, we crazy) but we actually admire and respect Canada very much and enjoy a decent relationship with them. Canada's the homie. 3. Look at all that cold uninhabitable tundra and all the upkeep and money it would require. 4 not trying to pick a fight with our shared allies, who would never deal with us again and would probably put up a pretty good fight. 5. Ew, French. No thanks
Next:  The ukraine-russian war  Oversimplified

Oversimplified posts longer video on a war with one pig as casualty than for the entire WWII 😅
“Biden is coming’’  me: Really is that true well, that impossible, because Biden is too worried about Ukraine
next video should be Spanish American war
When are we getting a Mexican revolution video?
why does the thumbnail look like it came from a star wars movie? 😂😂
I get the vibe that overly simplified is a lil anti American on this one
Will you do a video on ww3 when it’s over
"Could the US, still invade Canada? I mean, think about it, why not?" Every other country part of NATO:  "Allow us to introduce ourselves."
Please do one on chernobyl
ukrainian war...
that was the funniest thing I've ever seen
Canadian troops r the ones who burned the White House even tho we were under British rule. Also Canada won cuz our goal was to defend our selves, not invade America
Talk about British East India company

31:00
7:58 but the Americans com in and they don’t stop coming hopped in their wagons hit ground running didn’t make sense to sharing Oregon they outnumbered the Brits by 6 to 1
Should we be expecting a world war III oversimplified soon?
My IR prof mentioned this in class on Friday…
I remember this getting covered as a multiple choice joke in a sarcastic history book I read as a tiny Canadian kid. "Faced with the options of a) threaten legal action to the owner of the pig, b) build a better fence, or c) buy a couple big guard dogs, the American, being an American, chose option d) - shoot the pig." Or words to that effect.
And there's no way I'm ever gonna agree to it  Oversimplified
What if Lyman ate porky or why not conquer not only Canada but the whole world
Russia and Ukraine war of 2022  Wait wrong time period
Canada never lost war
more Canada plzzz
Goodies Stuart. Love that!!
It was on Nov 25th, 1872 that the British evacuated the islands. 91 years earlier, on the same date, Nov 25th, 1783 that the british evacuated from New york marking the end of British occupation and the end of the Revolution. Coincidence??????
7:58
Given the trucker situation, Canada is now an oil rich nation that requires some freedom. They are practically begging us to 'liberate' them.
Day 730 of asking OverSimplified to make The Roman Empire Over Simplified (please do it I have been asking for 2 years)
Russia vs Ukraine OverSimplified soon?
One thing I see weird is that florada looks like America’s pe-
Oversimplified has gone insane
XD a pig is Darth vader
Oversimplified not talking in his calm voice at the end caught my off guard
Can you please make a video explaining the Russia-Ukraine conflict? I’m sure you would explain better than anyone on earth 😫
Umm reminder that you promised us to do vietnam war about a year or two years ago
Being oversimplified, this was even more detailed than Wikipedia.
That ending was, weird.
u mean usa :<
5:37 yanki-doodle
All in favor for oversimplified as president
I’m  Back from two months. Please upload  p🥨🥨🥨
Montréal, américaine. Kossé ça calisse?.
OverSimplified please do War of 1812
Well, we wanted something about canada .
Hey you Should do more Please😯
This is his least viewed video and it has over 10mil views
Wouldn't be surprised if Biden did try to invade Canada. Either as a distraction or because he thinks it's syria
To be fair that is sketchy AF British law enforcement arresting Americans in america like come on now .
Manifest Destiny = Sheer Brilliance!
This was the best video you’ve ever come out with man your energy and everything just a masterpiece man 🤌🏼🤌🏼
i wonder what video will come next my guess is either the russian civil war or the vientnamies war
Hi oversimplifide can you talk a little bit about Iceland please?
As a Brazilian i think the Brits were right.
Quick question, are you going to do a video on the war between Ukraine and Russia if they do invade?
We want a video about the French occupation of Algeria
Cover Indian war with Pakistan of 1971
Lyman, if you strike me down, I’ll become more powerful  than you can possibly imagine…
let make a deal, we give you trudeau and you leave us in peace.. deal ?
What happened to OverSimplified
We need to rid the world of canada. Theyre way past their expiration date and have been rotting our head for too long. Together we shall unite to destroy the only country on earth to not exist, canada
When winter war?
That ending was glorious!
sub to oversimplified
Pls make new video🖥🖥🖥🖥
if this guy was my history teacher, I would actually pay attention
Do the civil rights movement
WATCHOUT CANA BIDEN IS COMING
ngl the view is low
I'm a Filipino and I would love to see the Philippine revolution
Imagine oversimplified’s next video is the entire FNAF lore
Oversimplified did you cause the convoy protest with your epilogue?
Do the wall street crash of 1929
the end had me smile for some reson
I mean,... the Germans did hate the British...so no wonder.
Could your next videos be on the Mexican American war?
You should do the Pacific War next :D
Hey, just letting you know YT unsubed me. I did resub, can’t wait for the next one
Nice ending
16:29 this guy had enough
I'm still waiting for the Punic Wars - OverSimplified
I would love to see you do prequels to WWI and WWII with the wars for German unification, the Franc-Prussian war (I know. That is part of the ears for German unification, but still...), the wars for Italian unification, the wars for Greek, Serbian, etc. independence, and the Balkan wars
a war almost started by a pig dyeing...............
So close to 6 milion subs. Congrats and wish You good luck!
any chance you could do an oversimplified African video like "Shaka" and the mufekani wars he caused or maybe even something about the Egyptian pharaohs?
Bro where are you you aint posting
I say the line in the channel is in the middle of the islands
Canada's hours
i’m offended, how dare you make the mistake of making him shoot a ak instaid of a m16. AHHHHHHHH
Not going to lie, Canada needs some Freedom right now. HONK!
Harney and Pickett are literally the closest butt buddies I’ve ever seen
Awesome ending my country is gonna appreciate this upcoming war. BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Oversimplified needs to do a video on the Ice Cream wars
As a Canadian the ending doesn’t scare me. America can’t invade us because most Americans live in hot places like Texas, Florida, and worst of all… California you’d freeze before you make it half to Quebec and Ontario.              By the way this is a joke.
biden is coming with a vengeance? he barely remembers what decade it is
I hope to see a video on the war of 1812
If just put up a proper fence non of this would happen
Goddamn that ending
You should do Vietnam war
Wow
O
best ending ever
With the protests going on in Canada, now might be a good time to invade and occupy Canada, eh US? 🤔
1:17 This is one of my favorite parts
Could you make non dynasty chinese history?
Oh god
Did I just watched 38 minute video about a war of a pig and a micro island and actually enjoyed it
Hey oversimplified can you do a Indian independence video
Mhm good luck with that
You should do the boer war next
'Merger of the century'  Greatest book
Canada will be merged with USA
Please make a video about Otto von Bismarck
Noice😂 Ending funny
This guy takes 7 years to upload a new video.
Biden is the weakest president ever and any country including Germany could invade and take us over.
this guy gonna need a therapist
We need to annex Canada and Mexico to form the USNA and just own it all. More coastline. More authority. More manpower. More industry. More resources. More EVERYTHING.
I wont philippine ammerica war
Filipino-american war
4:06 acurrate depiction of us americans
Please do the war of the Roses next!
It wasn’t just a pig that died that day, it was an Englishman’s lover. Profound. Crazy that was the same Pickett 🤦‍♂️. Great video really enjoyed it 👍
I like it how he says center of the channel then10 seconds later war bout to be here
Also the Island should have been British because USA already had LOADS of territories
The island should be HALF BRITISH AND HALF USA
Alright fellas if I become president I’ll take down Canada and it’ll become america because murica
37:45. If usa invade canada then would they make canada worse? They don't have free healthcare and alot of americans will migrated there
When he treated the sheep bro.
𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗢𝘂𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗱𝗮.
That ending tho
7:56 smash mouth all star reference lol
Do something about India
"But, being an American, he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a knife"
i i i i i  i i i i i i i i  i i i i i i i i i  i i  i i  i i i  i i  i i i i  i i i i       iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii i i i i i i i i i i i  i
i got ideas
A joke at the end?
great upload schedual
Bruh is this how normal Americans are?
I'd love some new zealand video
well that would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties…AND THERE’S NO WAY IM EVER GONNA AGREE TO IT!!!!! = best line ever
The pig is literally the definition of “if you strike me down I’ll become more powerful than you can possibly Imagine”!
General Scott:Bruh
100$ at the time was equal to 3,500 dollars, and most people where a lot poorer
The pig war should be called the pig cold war
Growning up in Washington State and going to WWU in Bellingham makes this interesting. Gen. George Picket was actually part of this.  Point Robert’s is the outcome of this.
War
Lets just have the ending actually happen
“I hear voices all the time”🤣
Sounds like the Americans stole a bunch of sheep then pulled guns when they were confronted
bruh!
can your next video be about the pastrie war?
You haven't done the war of 1812 yet?
37:09
Please make videos on Indian history

“One day Canada will be American states...” hmmmmm.....

LOL this whole video was just a persuasive ploy to get us Americans to take over Canada and my response is, what took you so long? Let's own Canada, boys.
America sure looked awful in this one.
6:29
Hide your syrup Canada, America is coming.
The pig talking took me so off guard

12:23   When it comes to the music.. This thing sure is uncanny, but I don't see Mr Incredible.

This is the biggest series of events caused by a pig since Attack on Titan
Biden is coming run
Settlementation...
Oversimplified should make a video about Julius Caesar rise to power that would be great.
“Being an American he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife” 💀 💀 💀
That was damn good. (Especially that ending.)
I just noticed that Captain Hunt flinched when General Scott throws the chair and I appreciate that
Wait. Did I just see the east coast personified as a man and Florida dangling in front of legs?  Lmao!  Got a sub from me just for that!
Ooh. Ouch. Remaining generation of Odawa Thunder Clan hears, “I didn’t say they were White people”. Funny. Still hurts.
Dude, you should do an episode about mussolini's life, i feel like he's underrated in ur channel
South asian Indian history is the most patriotic please make a video on it There were so many patriotic leaders - Alluri seetharamaraju, bhagat singh,Ghandhi, jhansi rani and so many more

That ending was beautiful 🥲 let's not actually invade Canada tho....
Pls upload a new one now 😢
That ending monologue is the most passion ive heard in Oversimplified's voice
do the mexican american wat
oversimplified needs to make a game with his same map style where we can play as many countries and fight with our divisions and there should be multiole scenarios lik, WW1, WW2, The Napoleonic Wars, and the Three Kingdoms. Basically AOC2 but with Oversimplified-style divisions (basically flags fighting flags) and oversimplified's map style
he didnt sound like the man i knew at the end
I hope the next video is the Vietnam war
As a Canadian if Quebec get is indepence and the rest of Canada get anexed by the USA I’m right … but if not …. I will never be able to sleep the night .
Do a Philippine-american war!!
Manifest Destiny is just Lebensraum but it seems acquiring living space is only bad when a failed Austrian painter turned Führer of Germany does it
38:05 *INTERNAL SCREAMING*
hey man you do alot of these awesome wars and stuff but you havent done 7 year war you should do it tbh
What happens when we run out of history?
This is probably the best ending I’ve ever seen by oversimplified.
We need oversimplified vietnam
I’m scared
I’m not Mexican but now I want you to make a video about Mexico
I’m Canadian egg
oh... you underestimate canada, huh? you cant beat the ones with the... secret weapon...
aight canada is done, make one next on British raj, could be a multiple videos and lots of indian will watch it, so u ll get more more views. waiting...
Hi there! my kiddos and I love your content! We would love it if you could do a piece on Hernan Cortez and the Aztecs in 1519.
Maybe u could do the history of the world oversimplified?
how do you do it
When's the next one dropping
War of 1812 in detail should be the next video, or Vietnam or Korea.
One thing Americans refuse to say: They lost the war of 1812. Also, if the US declares war on Canada, literally every country (That has a military) will defend Canada cause Canada is more liked than the US. We may have the weaker military, but how about a war between the US and the Rest of the World. *read more US and Russia: We have big nukes! Canada and Switzerland: We have peace✌  *read more Canada should be mentioned in war history since we did a lot in wars like WW1, Russian Civil War, WW2, Korean War, Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan War (and more). Also we are not smug (we mostly are more polite and nice*).  *Note*: I STILL LIKE OVERSIMPLIFIED!!! That was just some jokes above
TR
33:29 FBI OPEN UP!
Long Live The United States Nation!
It's been 2 months since this video . Please make more videos
Hey I really love your videos and you like it if you made one on the British history of India. Where i live
There's a mod for Hearts of Iron IV called "End of a New Beginning", that starts in 1859. *Perfect timing to add the pig war to the mod.*
Next Chinese civil war
Thank you so much for making a video on this. As a Washingtonian, we are sad our little war gets lost in history. You should make a part two about Point Roberts. :)  Oh, and you nailed americans perfectly (*hoots and shoots guns in the air*)
U should do a video on the Māori wars
Pause here 3:38 or click here but why does it say density and not destiny ohhh its a pun coz density is how much you have and how heavy nice pun
7:41 Oh sonofa, not again! Can you just make it to the next fort without getting sick FOR ONCE?!?!
22:50  Funnily enough his motivation could’ve been for the opposite reason. What’s a better way to unify a country than fighting someone else?
Need a video on the soup can war where the only casualty was a pot of soup. Amazing work BTW, keep it up!!!!
Hey can you do a video about Indian Independence? I'm learning it in school and it is very interesting

Good video but please make a Afghanistan war video thank you :)
🤔 This video took a little known incident and made it…..bizarre. . REALLY bizarre.
"they made me cry like a BIG girl!" haha oh god
Reminds me of Kim and kanye divorce. But islands instead of children.
And soon the islands will be lost to rising sea levels.
Gotta hand it to those plucky Americans.  Always eventually got it their way.
That drawing of Fort Vancouver is shockingly accurate
Why didn't they just meet in the middle and split the islands
23:09  Why did I think you were going to say they were secretly in love             28:00   I got what I came here for
Can you do the history of Confucius (In depth)?... Please 🥺
you legit are better at teaching history then classroom textbook reading could ever di
We won't need to invade the Canadians will join. No amount of emergency power will prevent truckers from parking in the middle of the highway. Never will mere peaceful protests cause their hard earned money to be stolen and frozen. Never will moving from one part of Canada to another be like passing through the Korean DMZ. True freedom just as God willed it. It is manifest destiny for Canada to join America 🇺🇸. It is their destiny as our freedom loving brothers. America has its issues sure but there is no nation in the world that has more freedom. freedom that even in the darkest times burns brightly. No matter how corrupt our leadership is other nations look to us the poor yearn for us the oppressed love us. America is a nation for all peoples all ideas. It is a nation to nurture and heal. That is what America is and what Americans are how could Canada not wish to be part of that
Suck it Brits! US 2-0-1
It’s been so long sense he last uploaded
Wondering if anyone caught the 80085 on the calculator?

Hey can you make a video on James Cook?
32:31
We are still waiting For the Vietnam war Episode
1:25
Lol, Spuddy's Sonic shoes.
Not that interesting
Yes... early Americans were expansionist...like basically every group of human beings before them! Shocking... I know. Hard for millennials and generation Twitter/Facebook to understand. Especially if they went to public schools (Especially in liberal cities and teacher union controlled schools).  For example, the Lakota Soiux tribe started out hundreds of years ago in the area of the Ohio River Valley. Over decades, the migrated up over the great lakes and down into the plains..SLAUGHTERING every other tribe they encountered. Killing, pillaging and even taking salves. Then, the Soiux and Pawnee battled and killed each other for decades BEFORE the evil white man got there. They just did it in small numbers unlike the Europeans who seem to only be happy when armies of thousands slaughter each other. Then again, the natives hadn't figured out the wheel....yet!  So, just one example of countless many. Humans are territorial and will fight and kill for resources. Hell, even our closest biological cousins, the great apes, do the same. Chimpanzees are brutal little bastards. The don't just kill their enemies...they freaking EAT THEM as well! Kinda like the Japanese...lol.  Nations NOT expanding and colonizing is a relatively new phenomenon. Well, apparently Russia/Putin hasn't caught on yet but...yea. So... when smack talking early Americans.... remember... yea... wasn't cool what they did but they weren't unique in doing it. Besides... do we really want to have say... Spanish neighbors in the south west or French to the north? Those people.... kinda crazy cultures...lol.
I love how all of the Americans have rascal scooters
Where is the Vietnam oversimplified I need
Straight line straight line
37:19 is where the gun begin

Next video: how one youtube video created war Video description: so... one idiot made a youtube video giving Biden some ideas... but stay safe during this war WITH NORDE VPN
From trash taste
Suggestion: If you don't know what topic of ur video, can you make biography of Alexander I
32:29
Also, this video almost went into like cringey & patronizing new comic book territory lol.
To be fair, General Harney didn’t become a general for no reason; early on in his military career and continuing on for some time, he was not only considered a war hero several times over, but also a brilliant tactician. He also let several successful peace talks with the Indians. He gets a bad rap because he savagely beat a (his?) female slave to death with a cane around 1830’s. For this action he was considered a monster even at that time.
Okay this always bugs me. I live in Whatcom County,.. why do you put so much emphasis on the 'com' part? Like, you say it really sharp. Also, this video and the rest are beautifully made and amazing! I just get a kick on how you pronounce the county I grew up in and live in. :D
I love the last part where the US can take Canada with one easy swipe. Hahahahaha
Guys if you want spoilers, see the Google maps

Hey man, for your next video you should do another mini-wars video about the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896. It lasted between 38 and 45 minutes making it the shortest war in history and it would fit perfectly for your mini-wars series

You made me love history. Your videos are fun, you explain very well , it's just the right mix of fun and culture that I love.
there was a similar situation to this in 1925 between Bulgaria and Greece when a Greek soldier saw a stray dog and when he went to get the dog and stepped into Bulgarian territory, he was shot and killed by a Bulgarian soldier

Can you do break up of yugoslavia
Potato Brandon
Hey, Oversimplified, I'm surprised you haven't made a video on nationalism and imperialism and the distinction between the two. I have some other suggestions, it's that you make a video on Timor Leste crisis of 1999.  believe it would be great because not many people are aware of it. Profoundly relish your content, spite literally almost being an adult, I seem to always come back to this channel. It's great content.  Well, it's Oversimplified and yes of course, facile to understand! Have you ever mentally conceived of becoming a pedagogy, I recon you would be a great one! You'd leave a smile on all of your student's faces after every class, even the ones who aren't into learning history!
Imagine using this video as reference for an exam saying that the british parliament ignored the issue with the islands over some guys mole, that be an A grade exam right there lol.
Would it not be amazing if oversimplified made a history of the entire world video but like really long, 6 hours or somthing

The entire plot of AoT in 40 minutes
So just started watching this channel recently. The comedic commentary doesn't at all burry the fact that serious research was carried out on the subject matter, and the final delivery is just gold. Love your stuff, keep it up❤️ Any African revolution, dictatorship or wars we can look forward to?? 🤞🏾
"That would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties. And there's no way I'm ever going to agree to it." This came up multiple times. LOL
I spied the silliness that is the northwest angle and point Roberts on this map too. Great video
If America did invade Canada in present day, that would probably start WW3
I'm just wondering if you could make the whole England/France civil war ??? I'm pretty interesting in it and it relates to my subject as well

I believe this is historically accurate..but as a zoologist I must contend that a pig would not drink a cream soda with a straw..
aye! a new oversimplified vid!
The speech at the end was cool and all, but are we just gonna ignore the spot-on Kermit impression at 18:15
Make a vid WW3
Where is your next video !!!
you should do the war of 1812. USA, vs Canada.
I think a good topic for an Oversimplified video would be The Coal Wars. It's not particularly spoken about (and genuinely not ALLOWED to be taught in West Virginia schools). And it's a really good tale for the same kind of treatment The French Revolution got, with the poor vs. rich dynamic. Kind of a side note, but I didn't know where else to bring it up lol
Hey you think you can do the France invasion of Mexico both 1st and 2nd war?
I wonder if oversimplified is gonna wait until Russia and Ukraine setttle this out
Wasn't there a Vietnam video on this page??
He should do westward expansion
oversimplified Vietnam war anyone?
Can you do battle of culloden
San Juan Island is shaped like a very small North America.
I feel bad for the pig 😢  He was probably being raised for slaughter later anyway, though. Meat is all we raise pigs for. We don't get wool or eggs from them, and while you could technically milk a pig, we don't because it's much easier and more efficient to get it from other mammals like cows or goats.
Why don’t you ever post?
You should do an oversimplify Mexican-American War
Ay where is ur knew vid
You should try facts
ahahha that fucking ending
5 Years later : WW3 OverSimplified
I’d love you to do an English Civil war video as I’d love to see your take on it 😂
I have an idea for a video. Could you please cover velvet revolution. For me personally it is the thing that got me into historky. It Is also really great story and message that not everything has to be done by war.
America wanted to gain weight. It succeeded, because of it's weight.
Americans- go to war against canada Indians- Ahhh sh*t here we go again....
Could you do the Haitian revolution?
I wonder how many likes to get a Vietnam war video? :P
At the end of the video  Oversimplified went..   Into scheme mode
We need the story of the ottoman empire
Anyone know the song used in 16:27?
30:00 your welcome.
Man I can't believe this crap. This is such a good video laughed hard and was like wtf. I'm now a subscriber and goint to watch all your videos. So good I can't believe this crap. 🤣
(If one, 2nd) Seminole War next 🙏🏼
2 months and no videos! What happened? When are you going to post new video?
Best parts of the video- 0:00 - 38:43
You and Vlogging Through History inspired me to make my own content…I wasn’t interested in history or geography much, but now, I’m super interested in it!
Dude how much do you know about history at this point lol
Can u make a video on the mongol conquests
100% we should conquer Canada. It'd be smaller in population and economy than California.
Can you do a video on the war of 1812 and one on the indian wars?
Never ask a Women her age, A man his salary And a oversimplefied why didn't he introduce himself to us to his channel on his first video

As a lifelong Canadian, the image of Wayne Gretzky draped in an American flag will haunt my dreams forever
Quit telling the urban myth about vpn and protected passwords! ;)
When do we get "Yugoslav wars oversimplified"!!
Pls make a video  on india
IF good ole 'Murica decided to Invade Canada, would it become a bunch of tiny states or one GIANT state?
4:10-4:15 is the greatest 5 seconds of this channel by far
Long live the Canadian war!
Every time nordvpn sponsors his video he always uses Hitler oversimplefied because it's actually the only one he can use

Canada was shaking in their booties until you threatened them with Sleepy Joe. Now they're just laughing
opium wars?
I see you got inspiration for the pig drawings from Gravity Fall's Waddles. Can't say i blame you. Waddles is the best ❤
smh didn't even mention Liechtenstein
We need crusade war please
Canada Vs America Canada will win
Can you do a spanish civil war?
Could you do the mongols?
The thumbnail is beautiful
27:54 How can a flag officer (Rear Admiral) outrank a politician?
Umm..I'm still not sure about the last part, sir. Anyway, it really sounds fun and exciting, as one of third party
7:57 all stars
i would like to eat kebab  also i want to say garles chiffin
Make a video on Ukraine-Russia tensions.
Hey, Oversimplified, do you reckon you could do a bit on Polynesian history? I reckon the Treaty of Waitangi would be great
33:27 😆
bet you won't make a video about Alexander the Great.  I bet it's pretty simple to break down Alexander... He was born to a Macedonian King and to a Greek Noblewoman With the king and queens marriage, Macedonia founded a League of Corinth or the Hellenic League founded by Philip II. Philip II gets assassinated after Alexander returns after fighting the Thebes and the Athenians enslaving them for the cause.  The king and future King had a bitter argument before Alexander's return from war about succession and leadership and what not.  Note: Philip II was assassinated during the Olympic Games, so it would be pretty cool to see a video about Alexander given the fact the Winter Olympic Games has commenced.   Alexander's empire went from Greece, in the lands of modern day Iraq and Iran, well past Afghanistan, and into the African plains of Egypt, the Empire continues into Bactria and into the Indus River. His Empire, even went to the gates of Persia and made their way through into unknown Indian territories. Alexander put down revolts, and mutiny's at this time. Even hunting down a commander named Bessus 'the Usurper'  that betrayed Dorias III of Persia well into the lands of the Hindu Kush and unknown areas in the Caucasus.  While doing this he established cities and named them Alexandria after himself. He established several cities all which were burned down in a civil war after the Great King passed away. All but one remained, the one he founded in Egypt his very first Alexandria, whom people say it is his resting place underneath a crypt within a Greek Orthodox Church.   Because of Alexander's empire shattering, Rome conquered the lands afterwards, asserting dominance over Greece. And through Julius Augustus Caesar, he conquered the former African territories, his inspired hero once did.  Alexander's noble titles: Basileus of Macedon Hegemon (Head/Sovereign) of the Hellenic League Strategos Autokrator (Commander-in-chief) of Greece Shahanshah (Shah) of Persia Pharaoh of Egypt Lord of Asia
This video is great but when will we get a Vietnam video?
Hey oversimplified , what about doing a video about the balkan wars
This was just a month ago uploaded??? feels like its been forever.

33:29 When your dad founds out you bought Robux from his card:

37:08 HEUHEUHEUHUEHHEUHE
5318008
are you technoblade or oversimplified
omg this what i call noice👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Sometimes I feel like Oversimplified made the hitler video just so he could use it as an example to advertise VPNs.
6:32 3 of the searches are about soup. Incredible
I frecking love your videos man! It makes the depression go away
One fact that didn't get in,  Lyman Cutler supposedly rowed 10 or so miles each way from San Juan Island and the Olympic Peninsula for those potatoe seeds
7:58 shrek for life lol
I like ending the best
Can you make a video about the Holocaust
But look, as a Canadian, I think that the reason oversimplified doesn’t talk about Canada in his videos much is because there is nothing to talk about, sure it’s good that we don’t have so much bad history to talk about like something as bad as the Civil war (no offense fellow Americans) but, having an interesting history just makes the country more interesting.   In school, after I learned a lot of history from oversimplified, like Civil war, American revolution, French Revolution etc.. I got bored of learning the history of Canada every single goddamn year. It’s the same thing. The most interesting history of Canada was when the BRITS WERE HERE 🤣🤣 we weren’t even Canada yet 😂, I am still grateful for how good my country, I just find other history a lot more interesting. I do not mean to offend anybody.
Your declarate in the end is going to start a war😂
Teacher: So class, what is the moral/theme of this story? Class: To never mess with a pig because a global war might start.
No, finish the old Ones before and then u can have a new war to make a video.
“But being an American, he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife.”      -Oversimplified
where is the religious war oversimplified
Can you do The Texas Revolution
I think the Spanish civil war and the subsequent dictatorship that came from it would be a really interesting video
Look I love you oversimplified but, this video kinda went to far on the jokes man, like you have too many,   your jokes use be short and sweet Just please man calm it down on the jokes before this channel forgets what it used to be! Please man I love this channel I really do but I can’t bear to see all these annoying jokes like the damn yee haw. After the straight line thing. Just please stop.  Btw big fan   God Bless
Why does the pig sound like Morgan Freeman in that scene
Just realized the wordplay on the island being 'rammed' with sheep.
Oversimplified can you talk about the Nanking or Nanjing massacre. You mentioned it briefly in your World War ll video.
You should make a video or two about The Seven Years' War because it is essentially ww0 with the amount of countries and continents involved, I think it would be very fun to watch.
And dying from dysteria
37:30 Unite North America under one flag
Can you do a video about the Hungarian Revolution please
Hi I wanted to ask if you might be able to make one on the Indian independence please

Please make more
At 5:17 you can see a map on the left with Vietnam coloured  in. Maybe this is hinting to a future video like "Vietnam War" or something like that?
Waiting for oversimplified to upload: 💀
A war with Canada would increase U.S. territory and the U.S. would win
When he goes "Ohhh Canada" at 1:13 I have watched this 20,000 times and still picture when he says that the Canadian anthem          Or is it the anthem?
Lets go make the world a better place! “Gunshots” “places McDonald”

I've never heard oversimplified scream so loud and talk so loud, he usually is like those youtubers who never show their face and sound like they can never scream or yell
No matter how much the world might change throughout the ages, there will always be idiots with too much power for their own good.
I want Alexander's conquests to be oversimplified's next video. His content is just amazing.
did you canadiens get what u want
My request- The presidencies/eras of James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson Oversimplified
I doubt Biden could point out Canada on map.
Hey oversimplified. I ordered the plushie 2 days after this vids release and i still didn't get it. P.S I also ordered an "average height for the holiday s" napoleon mug but i got that, both were ordered on the same day. Do you know what happened.

Biden can't conquer Canada.  He can't even conquer his mind nor conquer his wife.  Let's Go Brandon
“I have my Spotted Dick…” Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
I usually absolutely hate commercials especially seeing I pay for YouTube premium, however, this dude is such a funny fuck that he actually figured out a funny as hell way to slip one in here. Actually made me laugh out loud lol
You should do a video on the war of 1812.
OverSimplified Cinematic Universe Confirmed!!! I can't wait for OverSimplified: Endgame where all the character return for one big final battle with Thanos.

Lyman:our love is all natural Seconds later he takes spuddy to the ball  it's the most artificial thing I tasted Salty but sweet (Sorry if this is cringe)
Title should of been "CRAZY IRISH-AMERICAN BIDEN SUPPORTER WRITES AN ANGRY GOOGLE REVIEW OF CANADA"
Biden's comin, whether he wins the election or not. Who needs voters when you can steal an election?
can you do the spanish invasion in the philipines
The Crusades Oversimplified
Can you make a video of Spain civil war
The British part was the funniest 10:23
Do 9/11 and War on Terror now.
the seige of vienna would be cool for him to cover
It would be funny if oversimplified posted something like the 100 years war no one would see it coming
I thought USA wanted the whole oregon country, I remember that teh American government says that if Britain doesn't give them all the oregan country then they will declare war, OverSimplified showed that what America actually wanted is just straight line, thanks so much, OverSimplified.
One hundred years war oversimplified?
that last part was better than every political manifesto speech of mankind.
I love your videos!!!! (I was wondering if you could do a video about the Alamo and/or Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome :) )
3:48 “I hear voices all the time” 😭😭😭😭
Ur channel is fucking awesome
I for one would be down to invade Canada. The only possible way it could go wrong is is Biden was our commander in chief
No way all this shit actually happened
Go woke, go broke
You need to be a history teacher, that class would be awesome
Hey oversimplified could you please do a video or 2 on the Irish civil wars  or the anglo-Irish war please
Oversimplified can you do the nigirian civilwar
Oversimplified forgot Canada never lost a war but smerica has
We may not have nuclear heads, but any canadian will tell you how any moose easily equals one of those. They are beast of pure destruction with no concerns for anything. A... Mammal warhead, if you may.
I like these videos, but this guy always cries croc tears for the native Americans having "their land" conquered by whites. Funny thing is that we most likely wouldn't have evolved to this point in time where people can make videos on YouTube from their couch and make loads of cash... This guy is directly benefiting from the conquering.
18:38 mf pumped a double barrel shotgun
Suggestion - What about a history of Malta, and the Great Siege of 1565?
Every one be plagerising
Hes back!
2:55 - "Be a Legend, No Bad Latitude" is such a brilliantly multi-level dad joke.

Canuckistanians after seeing the ending: "Gosh bud, let's slow it right down. Here, have a beer and let's talk this one oot."
P.O.V.: You want the Viet Nam war oversimplified. the chat: "Shh, they're in the trees."
Why are americans like this ?
America is easily the worst country ever.
Oversmplified pliz can you reach to the Pilipins history and the Pilipins hero
Oversimplified should do the Vietnam war next
What if this guy made a mini-wars video on the Mapago brothers?
As a Canadian I am scared out of my mind.
why do you want the us to invade Canada, it's an independent nation now
whats that song that stars playing at 7:24
the united sates and canada are allies dummy
27:26
As a canadian, i am scared.
Watch out canadians... Biden's comin', and this time, it's not on your kids...
Fantastic way of educating people, regardless of their age! I want you to do Vietnam next
When the non-varsity team of colonizers want to get involved…

Do poland video

Make a video on the holy crusades
Balkanic Wars!
Hey I'm Canadien not cool

i think Pablos Escobars story would be cool
Ukraine invasion when
Do the great depression
welp im canadian guess im gotta be on high alert lol

I like to imagine he only takes the Nord sponsorships so he can complain about the Hitler video being blocked
LOL. Biden conquer Canada? Biden couldn't conquer a wet dream.
You should make a video on the Spanish American war it would be a splendid little video.
That ending 😆😂😂😂😭
What’s the song that starts at 12:04
Petition to have Over Simplified to do an All Star remix as a history recap. 7:58

You should do a british civil war next

oversimplifed Sixteen Kingdoms?
Can u do the croatian vs serbia war
yes very historical U.S.A invades Canada.
This is the worst video I have ever seen
Peace Meditation Phrase Old Lyran written as: Salome gam nan ben Urda - gan njber asala Hesporona! pronounced as: Saalome gam naan ben uurda gan njjber asaala hesporoona! English: Peace be on the Earth, and among all created creations! Deutsch: Friede sei auf der Erde, und unter allen Geschöpfen!
Guys it seems like Putin's out of oversimplified videos
If WW3 break out there will be new video, which i guess is good
Ah yes, in order to settle, we Americans place a McDonald's,  thats why there are McDonald's all around the world, we are manifestly destined to own the world
Hey oversimplified bro can you make a history episode about the Philippines?
We need more captain hornby
I think we should use this as a tool to prevent war between Russia and Ukraine over Crimea. Both sides should maintain a small force on the peninsula, in a joint military occupation, until a neutral country can decide on who owns it.
Bruh
do greek wars
I know I'm not the only one who felt the sheer despair in that whimper at 16:30
Can you make mini wars boxer inserection
Can't believe one month has passed it feels like just yesterday I had watched the ending 100 times
37:54 The woe of every American......😂😂😂
The ending was Pierre gold.
You uploaded this video on my birthday.... 7/12/2008..... this was the best birthday gift I've ever gotten!!! Thank you Oversimlified!!
PNWer here. I vaguely rember this from high school. But I'll probably retain it now because this video is epic.
Make a video on Indian revolution
That was the best outro to an Oversimplified Video that I’ve ever seen
Them darn glubby yanks.
A group of settlers tommy-gunning down a herd of buffalos is by far the most comical and adorable representation of Manifest Destiny I've ever seen.
No one talking about Morgan Freepig? 31:02
I hope he makes a video about the Spanish-American war
Can you do Vietnam war next please
Nord VPN killed my family just cuz i wouldn't buy it
do the turky war
Anyone think we should get a Vietnam war?
7:54
Yo can you do the Texas revolution.
by far the best ending of these videos
You should really do a video on the Gombe Chimpanzee war
Biden: Well now I wanna invade Canada
Please do the Korean War
Can you please make a video on the Texas revolution
As much as I love oversimplified I wish he would stop making it seem like racism & slavery are “American” things. He did it in the Civil War and American Revolution videos and it’s just really frustrating when you know the true history that both racism & slavery were common practice around the world and have existed for thousands of years.  Slavery & defeating the Native Americans are not American sins or evil deeds. They’re just the results of the time these people lived.
Lol smash mouth
Next: History of indonesian independent war
Vietnam war plssssss
Good and The Very Good .
how about indonesia
Hey can you do The Banana Wars please?
Try us
is it just me or did the pig sound like Morgan Freeman?
As a Canadian I gotta say the video was good but the last bit was phenomenal
I want to see a roman war covered by oversimplified

Please Make The Roman Empire Oversimplified THAT WOULD BE SO COOL
Please do a video on the Vietnam War
Who else is all excited for the new WW3 oversimplified video? I am
day 1 of asking oversimplified to make a video about the only empress to ever rule China
what a wonderful time to be alive!
Might I recommend making a “History of the Mongols” video.?
Harney is my favorite character is oversimplified
This manifest destiny made you, your video, this platform and this country possible. You seem kinda biased against conquest, but you've gotta realize that this is how things would work out then. Nowadays companies buy countries. And instead of killing the natives, they just fire them.
please can you do a video on crusades
At 12:15 that’s the beginning of deep sea fandango but why did you only put in the cello and bass part add some violas and violins
I like how Douglas has a picture of himself and spaghetti Jeff from Bologna together beside his bed.
Please make a video on Indian history and other battles related to India 🇮🇳🇮🇳.
Technical Wayne Gretzky already has dual American/Canada citizenship and played 11 years of his career in the usa
You should do the Mexican American war
The greatest war story ever told
When America expands by eating a hamburger they got a massive Florida sized dong
Next=Alexander the great🇬🇷
Vietnam War or War of 1812 next?
You know, this one is kinda wholesome and nice. Oversimplified already made most of western history kinda "wholesome" but the storytelling around minute 33 is just super nice.
Make face reveal when you get 6M Subs
Pov your doin ur daily routine of seeing if Oversimplified did upload a new vid
Hi sir i really love ur videos i am a kid from india the only possible way for me to donate you is through brave rewards i have sent donated 0.5 bat which is approx 0.4 dollars i am sorry it is not possible for me to donate more than that thank you

BEST. HISTORY. VIDEO. EVER
You gotta do something on the history between Russia and Ukraine. That would be a banger right now!
French Revolution part 3
Please make a video on Indian freedom fights or wars 😀
Oversimplified finna make a Russia and Urkraine war video
I’m AMERICAN but I’m on the side of the brits on this one? That asshole killed the pig after HE invaded the territory! 😡
Hello over simplified my names chaz and I want to thank you very much for what you’ve done for me.  I have just got accepted to West Point military academy, with a full ride and I thank that all to you. You’ve made me love American history or just history in general. I have just passed the American history test just a few weeks ago and it’s only because of your videos. There amazing and so entertaining and I just can’t thank you enough. You’ve turned my life around and so many more so I just want you to know that if you actually see this if you need anything and I mean anything I will help you out and please keep the videos up. And may I suggest you make a video and about the history of places like the full history of England or Japan or even France so that’s it and thank you.
i think you are too over-nationalist
Are you going to do the fall of the Soviet Union oversimplified? I feel like that would be a good video.
Poor pig.
37:04 For the based moment.
Don't sing it. Bring it. Oh Canada!
I feel like you just threatened Canadians and all of Canada, “SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN”
This is so funny
Can you make a 100 year war video
I have to ask- does the pig in the title supposed to look like a Star Wars Sith lord?
You do realise that is one can either snap or store can you just gonna be screwed row report join with Canada honestly I don’t recommend going to Wauconda you’re going to die do you have power mode and you go well-trained we can easily kill you America
As a USAF vet who is going to a veterans range day tomorrow, the last 2-3 minutes of this video were fucking awesome!
Why is everything glubby?
37:05 oversimplified starts descending into American nationalism madness.
Harney, absolute legend.
32:22 Winfield Scott watched behind the door
After a few months without visiting this channel, I visit and three more vids! I love this channel
A video on native americans' history
Where is Vietnam war???
Hahaha, Biden is coming.  Love that line.

I might have actually watched your videos if they didn’t have embedded advertising. You know, the advertising that I’m paying YouTube not to see?
The nordvpn thing gets me every time
what the heck that outro was wild
Please can you do the Glorious Revolution?
U should do the war of 1812
You should make a video about the Sino-Japanese War!
The islands are British
Basically there is this island and we dont know if it was american or inglish. An american citzen killed a british person pig and they started a war.
As someone who grew up in San Juan’s, this summarized an entire semester of our APUSH class. There’s a park that I’ve been to for history where the camps are. They could see each other whenever they were outside. This story is such a huge part of my love of history so it’s cool to see a video about it, but also I need you all to know that this ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND ITS YOUR FAULT IM NOT A CANADIAN
😂😂👍🏻
16:36
I would love to see an Oversimplified of The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how Britain started it by creating the state of Israel in Palestine !....that will be entertaining !!
This man gives us more history facts than a crappy 100k college
Canada won the war of 1812
Me still waiting for the "Vietnam war": ;-;
10 million views in 7 weeks! And the greatest product placement in Youtube video history. Plus, I finally learned something that I've wondered about for the 20 years I have lived here. Subscribed.
Can u do Mongolian history pls????
That ending killed me
"Them's some nice spuds you got there", loved the flashback, lol!
White people's animalistic brutality is shown so comically , and i like it
Make a video on indian independence
I'M HOLLERING THIS VIDEO IS ABSOLUTE GOLD
Can you do the anglo-zulu war since i really like to see the history of it
oof the people in that universe sucks, good thing its all just movie
I get the feeling that oversimplified has just a normal name and we’ve  probably passed him 100 times IRL so I’m just gonna call him Steve.
PLS make a video on Indian revolution!!
Damn if only porky said no
And that ending good sir, deserves an honorable like for the video. Watch it Canada
Please do the afganastan war
Can you do a Mexican American War video so I can learn it more
Can’t wait to see ww3 video
Please can you do a video about the Nigerian civil war
Hey could you do the Toledo War, would make a great short video.
I was already dying laughing at the whole parlay with foul beasts part, but 13:27 absolutely sent me.
I have a idea for a video.  maybe you could tell how the wild west began and ended or something
I hope you'll eventually do a Mini-War episode about War of 1812 or Spanish-American war
DO THE ANGLO ZULU WAR NEXT
Make a Texas independents
Argentina: first time?
All jokes aside, every time he mentions San Juan island I just keep thinking myself  Why is he talking a Puerto Rico and then 'oh its british San Juan not spanish San Juan
Your energy is unmatched on yt your a historic youtuber and its better than any other content just keep going bro
8:00😂😂😂😂😂😂
" whoa whoa whoa! I didn't say they were WHITE people." **silence** YAAAYY  Me: wtf
3:51 "I hear voices all the time" lmao
Drawing the border on the Columbia River wouldn't really be a compromise since it basically just involved giving the land to Britain. America would have already had most of the river if they went by the parallel.
I am dying to see another content of oversimplified .....eagerness at its peak now
YEA AMERICAAAA FU*K YEEEEAAAA!!!!!!!!
Make one vid on Indian history...... It's too vast.... You select your time period of history and make a vid...

I really admire Oversimplified and I love little cartoon characters you use in your videos, I want to use them to design my next preparation in university. If someone know which software can do that, please tell me the name of it? 😘😘😘😘

The comedic nature of this war Lol

1:10 killed me
3:34 yo Florida what you doin?
Oversimplified really went from 2 videos and 14 minutes total of the entirety of WW1 to a single 40 minute video on a war that didn’t actually happen
Hey Oversimplified. I doubt you'll see this, but I'm trying to actually use the comment section for constructive purposes. I love your videos, but in my opinion, your more recent ones have dedicated too much time to lengthy jokes instead of story telling. In previous vids, I felt like your jokes were quicker and wittier instead of drawn out. Maybe it's just because I'm not really interested in this particular story tho! Keep up the good work.
18:39  First time I ever saw anyone pump a break-action shotgun.
And this is here, as a proud canadian, I mentioned that Canada never lost a war and burned down the white house before…. Little johnny, are you sure you wanna lose again ? Tanks aren’t doing great in the great north…. We live there… give us alaska back and we will forgive this mutiny!
You never angry and Irish or Scottish man also god people are idiots
Squarez vs I AM DA STAIRS
I have an idea for your store you should sell iron on patches of your characters you make along with the pins you sell just a thought:) love your videos!
Hi! OverSimplified can you do a vid based on women rights?
Can you make a Video of the Vietnam or the Korean War?
You should do the glorious revaluation because you’ve done America
Imagen if oversimplified made a video about the history of the Islamic caliphate in all its forms
Oversimplified is making videos slower than rockstar is making GTA VI
Manifest Destiny😂😂
Usanians are always being weird.

The US/CAN border is a still an unnecessary pain in the ass.
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming  hopped in their wagon and they hit the ground running it didn't make sense to keep sharing oregon when they outnumbered the Brits 6-1"
video idea: Khmer rouge oversimplified. also video idea: life of pol pot.
Fuck movies play this in Cinemas😂🤣🤣
this is one of OverSimplified's more opionated videos by far
Make a video about Louis Riel
and do the russian civil wa
Wait he'said that Pickett!?
Hey, I know Vietnam war is coming soon. But can you make a Korean War? These videos are definitely worth the wait they always make me laugh! :)
That ending was a twist... but I'm down to invade what else do we have going on eh?
You should do the war of 1812  ;)
Can you do the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth next please
33:23 I laughed so hard

Canada would win some how. I don’t know how, but some how.
Is someone who once deal with usanians people next Door.  Yes theyre a nightmare.
Did you delete some of your old videos? There is a specific fact on the pope that I learned in your videos that I cannot find anywhere
33:17  Scott leaves the room but doesnt stop listening Harney sends Pickett  back to the island Scott bursts in and beats Harney stupidity to a pulp  me: "OH YES!!!! OHHHHH MY GOD YES I LOVE IT WHEN IDIOTS GET COMPLETELY DESTROYED!!!!"
I love the Star Wars inspired thumbnail
Bruh I'm in germany and cant see the hitler videos
These are brilliant
Boring.
Reunification of Germany next!! (Including Franco-Prussian war)
I was hoping that you would make a video on Indian history too... I would really love to see you explaining the great war of Haldighati between Akbar with his 9 ratan and Maharana Pratap... He was a great king in Marwar region. Anyway if you don't want then you can pick any of Indian history as we have a really long history
you should totally do the British Civil War of the 1600s next
Video Idea: Spanish-American war and the effects like America briefly taking control over Cuba and the Philippine-American war.
"Biden is coming, baby and he's coming with a vengeance!"... Never have I laughed so hard in my life.  Pres. Biden couldn't send back cold eggs at a Denny's.  And yes, I'm an American.  Canada is safe.  Well, except for Montreal, but that's y'alls problem.  lol
Can u do Philippines pls =) I am new subscriber
omgomgomg how can i miss this
Why do I see Harney holding a light saber?
He basically tells us history that we never knew
One problem with the US invading us, we supply their power, of which they only give 1% back.  We also have what will probably be the last remaining source of oil, being the oil sands. Plus the Canadian Shield which is absolutely crammed with valuable minerals. And lastly, we don’t still use the archaic imperial system.
27:22 LMAO
I love just the blatant homosexual endorsements it shows a lot of character of the narrator also it makes for a funny running joke so thank you oversimplified
what's the song at 7:26?
We almost became Canadian (dang it)
Hey oversimplified could you make a video about African states too ... especially Tshaka the zulu , Ethiopian unification, slave trade and transition to legitimate trade 🥺 plis man .. yo content made me develop this huuuuge passion for history .. this wud help a lot
yo btw before you said you were gonna make a vietnam war vid but when u gonna upload it
I feel bad for Canada lol
13:28 BAAAAA!!!!!
When is oversimplified Vietnam coming ?
@OverSimplified I know that you are working on another project right now but is it possible that sometime in the future you can make a remaster of WW1?
Would be awesome if Oversimplified made a video about the Chinese Civil War, like to make him see this message!
Oversimplified is like jesus. He's barely there but once he is it's like going to heaven
amazing ending :)
Hey, could u do one on India??? Anything is fine
and the badge joke was amazing :)
the sheep talking was amazing :)
Please do the Vietnam war!
37:52 u know what? I'm not gonna let THAT happen.
37:19 the best part LOL
Hey oversimplified in your "Russian revolution 2" video you said that "the Russian civil war would need it's own video"  Are you still planning on doing that?
Still waiting for vietnam war or crusade🤷‍♂️
Arguing over which channel in the middle of nowhere gives rights over some tiny islands in the middle of nowhere to your nation is violently British
33:29 Laughed So Hard
33:29 I Laughed So Hard
can you make a video about the korean war
What event are you doing now? I'm curious.

Plessers make a vid About the 80 years war From 1568 to 1648
19:12
36:57
Lol
The WW3 video is gonna be a banger
i used to think British were the worst but Americans! this just blows my mind.
12:23 Mr.incredible gets slightly uncanny
I'm moving out of Canada. I'm going to Russia.
10:55 being with da bois be like:
You should do the Vietnam war!
fun fact: biden really was coming but got distracted and forgot canada existed
can you do the endustal revlution
Oh yea I’m pretty sure someone said that it would look better if they got the west
I like when Lyman’s in love with his potato and Grifin is in love with his pig
I don't care for pigs so I think Lyman is in the right for shooting the magic pig
I’m so surprised the last 2 minutes weren’t an ad. Most people stopped watching because they probably thought it was an ad. He really puts in all the effort into his videos
the perfect ending doesn't exist-
american bullies
I'd love to see oversimplified videos for Russia's Time of Troubles, or NC and Georgia's Walton War. They are some pretty ridiculous but often overlooked conflicts.
When will u gonna do Vietnam war
You should do the Texan Revolution
Do the Texan revolution
But Canada is apart of the us
Are you going do a video about the Romans or  Ancient Egypt
I dont think anybody noticed but 14:29...just look at the calculator will u , the attention to detail this guy has is applause worthy
Apple bottom jeans boots with the fur (the fur) da whole club was looking at her she hit da flo (she hit da flo) next thing I know showdie got low low low low low low low low
Can we do a Mexican American war video I feel like you guys would do a great job with it
Can you please please do Julius Caesar.
19:33 is my favorite part
Omg the end 🤣
You should do a video on the great Northern war, I think it’d be really interesting to know more about it, as well as make for an interesting video.
Julius Caesar pls:)
I dare you to do the northern Ireland troubles🤣🤣
Who is watching this in 2022
Can you the Philippines history
Biden's gonna trip in it's way to visit the frontline troops and die
This channel is so great. Can't wait for more porcine related stories
All I learned from this is British are complete push overs.
Please do the Persian Wars
That ending was stellar, now that is passive aggression to the Canadians who always feel neglected in history stories lol 😂 I think they'll think twice now if they don't want to have Biden as their president lol.  Though to be honest, I think if this did cause a war, how likely would the Civil War still happen? Would the Pig War rally support from both North and South, or with it further divide the US that the British end up occupying the North half? 🤔
The you tuber original human is stealing your content.  He’s not a reaction channel, he just puts his head in the corner and uploads your videos with the sponsorship cut out, which sucks your sponsor integrations are amazing.  I have seen these videos all over Facebook and it’s a scumbag act.  Please take down his videos before he “reacts” to the pig wars.
7:57 I know that reference
Nice
7:57 the best thing I heard
No to Canada!
Would you ever do a video of Battle of Little Big Horn, or History of Custer?
Good job making this video
MAKE A VIDEO OF THE WAR OF 1812
This is so good
Lol
From watching oversimplified
Lol. Brain size 1,000,000 feet
Nothing is British
I’m a kid
I like everything that you do for me to make my own video
Hi I love watching the stuff it is so interesting
Way to go OverSimplified! I laughed out loud at that last Biden meme!
I would love to see an Oversimplified of “The Troubles” in Northern Ireland.
Fun fact when you say "go suck an egg" that was one of the most offense things to say in the late 1800.
His videos are becoming more and more detailed for a channel called oversimplified
That ending was everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!! xDDD
7:58
The pig war ended without even beginning... Why I can feel technoblade's aura in the air.
Still waiting for the Vietnam war one
I think a couple of cool wars you could is the Greek-Persian war, the Greek Civil war, or the Battle of Troy
Americans had already fought a bunch of wars against other white people to facilitate westward expansion. It’s oversimplifying history at best to pretend racism was a motivating factor. They would have moved west no matter what skin color the people had. So stop with the woke crap. You’re oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy and we already have too much of that these days.
best episode yet!
Black death and peasant revolts oversimplified?
Does this man have a fade? 12:43
Wonder if he will ever do this for games
nations often clash, sometimes in the aftermath of that clash the losing nation can diminish... the Natives suffered atrocities that should never be forgotten, but they should also be considered equal combatants in a struggle they lost... to suggest they were simple people outmatched by the mighty Europeans is infinitely more insulting than pretending nothing went awry at all... those tribes were only there to be conquered because they had survived previous attempts to be conquered, no tribe of people to ever walk this planet did so bloodlessly...
wtf were they doing
Make a Hundred Years’ War video
Love your videos!
The end of pig wars was more intense then any other point in the whole duration of the war.
If you like more about history then check about Indian history
And shoot a video about Peter 1 and what he did for the Russian Empire Please
Oversimplified Explanation: Manifest Destiny
Tell me you hate America without telling me you hate America.
ORDER! ORDERR! SHUT UP!
Love your content! I wish you posted more often but I understand it must take a while to animate your stories. Keep doing what you are doing
As a Brit, one of the things sticking out most in the video is the pronunciation of Berkshire. It should be pronounced as “Barkshire” even though it isn’t spelled that way. Pedantic to the end.
Oh man! Don't be so radical, ha?
my history likes your content even subbed you  :9
dude, do culloden
THE ENDING LOL
The literal Bay Of Pigs.
wow, this was really good!
Biden is trying to conquer Canada!! Et him overthrown!
37:25 insert Mattias Torres "Picture It" meme here;
I'm not surprised the man responsible for "Pickett's Charge" was involved in something as outlandish as this.
It's might be cool if Oversimplified make an episode " Roman Empire "
I was wondering could you make a video on Indian Revolution / indian freedom movements or on Vietnam War .
7:59-8:03 That's like a parody of All Star by Smash Mouth.
Do a filler between the Napoleonic Wars and the world wars and do the wars for Italian and German unification and the wars for Greek, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Serbian independence and the Balkan wars
Hey OverSimplified, I love your videos. Keep working guys. And, please make a video about the wars in Vietnam against France and U.S. I know it would be heatedly controversial, but I think the world should be remined of those war once again. I am Vietnamese and I am proud of my country's history. Many thanks.
LMFAO!!!! Id rather not have Americia in Canada...
Could you do the great depression?
Love the vids and merch
You should do more kingdom videos cause I think a lot of people would like them and I would also :)
Biden coming baby hahahaah

3:36 Damn, that Florida tho
Hey can you do the mexican American war oversimplified
Do a video on the Roman empire and Julius Ceaser
I can't wait for the plushies to start shipping
I just want to put light to the scene where Harney asks pickett to bring him flowers. That's funny. Also the iron sets his head ablaze. hat's really funny. But then he has a whole scene explaining what they're going to do and possibly why they're doing it IN CHARACTER! Only for him to circle back to the flowers joke that we have forgotten about by now to close up that entire scene. Oversimplified isn't just a history youtuber. He's a legend.
Still hoping to get a Vietnam war video
I’ve watched this video at least 5 times since it’s been released. Love this channel, I hope you keep up the great work! 👍
I would like to see the war of 1812 oversimplified pls

Canadians after having their country mentioned in multiple videos and being the main character of a video: *Its not enough* Indians after having their country mentioned in one video: “I’ve seen enough, I’m satisfied”
LOLOLOLOL SO FUNNY
Oversimplified is running out of wars, we need more wars. World war 3 anyone?
Glad to see my home island getting some love.

I’m pretty sure some people have already asked for this but I think the Roman Empire over simplified would be dope
Oversimplified needs to relax

If history class had've been this entertaining, I not only would've aced every test, I might've become a historian. Great story. Great narration. Great animation. A+ and a 🌟
you can really make this a historical fiction comedy. Kind of like The Producers, its about a bunch of military officials trying to start a war over some hysterical tiff involving disputed territory and a pig.
what’s the song at 16:28
Bro oversimplified you're a legend but coukd you also make a video on maybe the india-pakistan wars or smthin

War of 1812 please!
That's so funny
hey ovesimplified can you do 55 days at peking or the irish civil war
I would like to say something about oversimplified video. Call me stupid but sometimes I can't differentiate between comedy and true story. Like the president hiding behind a curtain. Is it _true story, exaggerated reality, or just a joke._ It would be nice if we get a small footnote that stated if it's one of the 3 categories I italicized.
Can you make sure that there are subtitles for all common languages like French, German and Russian and so on?
Video tip: The Netherlands has been at war for 300 years with the Isles of Scilly. No shots have ever been fired.

Can you do a video of the 7 years war?
the american government after seeing this video : get this man a war
Make a VietNam War video my dude
I'll say War of 1812 is oversimplified by you lot to the point of lies,  half truths, omissions and pure bias. That war was started by President James Madison to steal Canada from Britain while it was involved in a life and death struggle called the Napoleonic Wars. Testament to this = it was called Mr Madison's War. 3 invasions mounted by USA to try to steal Canada from Britain in 1812, 1813 & 1814 - all consistently defeated in spite of being greatly outnumbered by the Yanks. By 1814, Britain had enough if thus so mounted the Chesapeake Campaign in 1814 - brilliantly successful in spite of huge odds.
Anybody else check to see which country owned the islands on Google maps halfway through 😂
Leave the nice people alone

Next time, make Vietnam war or crusade.

No way we want you and your expensive healthcare systems, stay where you are americans. You should learn from us and have more spending on healthcare, spending on fighting the fake news (desinformations) than arming your armies, we ain't in age of empires anymore
Harney sent Pickett back to the island. This enraged General Scott, who punished him severely.
that devil pig is terrifying
Do the gulf war!!!!!
Well that's a collaboration I didn't expect, Gun Jesus himself as Captain Pickett!
31:12 was that morgan freeman?
As a canadian, i hate the end oml
PLEASE do the idustrial revolution thanks
Can u make Korean war plz?
I hope that Germany decides were right again because we hired a bunch of salesman to sell it. But we can have affordable healthcare because we stole it 😂. I kid.
The reason America hasn’t invaded Canada is… I was going to put something clever here, but I legitimately don’t know.
No we can’t invade Canada
Me rewinding right as the sponsor begins: And that's why I use... This video is sponsored by NordVPN.
Hii man big fan love from India pls make a video on battle of plassey carnatic war
3:37 did anyone else realize it said "Density" instead of "Destiny"?
32:16 why is nobody talking about this, lmfao
It took me an embarrassingly amount of time to understand that the guy with the blue hair is just using the nord vpn logo as a wig
Where the hell are new videos🤗😡😡
Could you do the 80 years war for me and my ducht brothers
Would be real interesting to see the golden age of the Dutch oversimplified
If the US invaded Canada, it would be more than twice as big as it is now.
You could put the subtitles in French please because it’s really hard for non-bilingual thanks
make a video about israeli palestinian conflict
I love your videos Oversimplified. Could you perhabs consider making a video about the Turkish War of Independence with Atatürk being at the focus, please? We would very much like it here on Turkey. Of course, i know everyone are probably showering you with this kind of requests about their own country, so i obviously dont want to press you, i still respect your pace and choice of topics.  Keep making amazing videos, you are great at it. Cheers.
The only thing OI' Joe is coming for is his depends.
War pig
OverSimplified has probably gotten many people into history with his animations
People : OverSimplified doesn't hav an intro  Nord VPN : _AM I A JOKE TO YOU_
British: destroy the white house and conquer the capital city Americans: will call that a draw
Would be nice to see a Mongol Empire oversimplified video.
7:57 this sounds familiar
7:53 all star lol
This was friggin amazing. A+
Best ending ever. That was great.
I played 31:00-31:10 at least 15 times in a row
Please talk about the Libyan Revolution (Civil War)
14:05…”but being an American he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife “. LOL!
Thank you and see you in six months
The enthusiasm in his voice about conquering Canada is so funny
The farm hand pissing himself laughing gets me everytime. 🤣 18:35
Why not make a video about the great Vietnam? The only country to have ever beaten the U.S., China, France, Japan and South Korea.
It said the middle so should go through the centre channel
Hmm. Interestingg
Someone's been indoctrinated in school to hate the US with a passion... As if all of humanity didn't have a tendency to murder people that got in their way back then. Like the Dakota's who exterminated the Sioux in Montana in the 1800's, just a decade or so before the US took the area over.
Excellent resource for creating a self-hating anti-thought global zombie alliance. onward to a world free from critical thinking, math, freedom, justice, ideas, responsibility, individuality, God, and all things "white"! Learn to nurture and justify your your hate without having to do any real research or understand anything! Ever! Resetting humanity back to the stone age has never been easier! Why fight? Surrender is easy and well do it together! Embrace Lucifer and join the trending collective! The earth is flat! If one jumps, we all jump! Grow your ego by joining the biggest and trendiest social journey down the Broadest Path to the Widest Gate of plenty! Hail Satan!
Simplifilm episode one, the pigtom menance.
4:10 for Europeans wondering yes this is what it’s actually like
mole mole mole
Love your videos!
Oversimplified has a very good understanding of how those outside the US view the US
So funny! lol
Why not snuggle *with me!*
lol I like when they talked about good than all the Americans just came on the boat
Do the war of 1812
The end part of the video when you talk about Canada strongly reminds me of Lyle Wrath intros for pregame discharge
36:55 and the potato casualties?
BTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We Have The Manpower. We Have The Arms. It's our Manifest Destiny! Picture a Future, where American Mounties wear Red, White and Blue and Hail the Stars and Stripes! Where Wayne Gretzky would wave the American Flag every Fourth of July in the streets of Montreal! Maple Syrup! The Greatest American Food! Banff! The Greatest American National Park! One United Nation under the Leadership of our Glorious President, Drake! No longer shall we Tolerate our Smug Neighbors to the North with their Affordable Insulin! And Endless Comments complaining that I don't talk about Canada much in my Videos! That's right Canadians! Watch your Backs! Sleep with One eye Tonight! Because Biden is Coming Baby! And this time, He's coming.  WITH VENGEANCE!!! 🇺🇲🦅
I've watched this video now for 5 Times or so, i just like it and its funny AF good job oversimplified
7:58 is this a part of All Star song? xdd
so america = hamburger
oversimplified you should do a video on the war of the roses.
Only humans would go to war over a dispute over a line on a piece of paper.
Drake would make a better president than most in recent years
My grandparents lived on San Juan Island, so every summer we'd visit on vacation. My grandma was obsessed with The Pig War, so much so that she built a building and created a Pig War Museum. She had old mannequins and wax figures dressed up as the primary people. When we'd visit she have us dress up as some of the characters. We have a picture of my younger sister dressed up as the pig and my dad as Lyman. I always thought she was crazy. At the time I only knew the pig shooting parts of story. She never went into the insane amount of politics that surrounded the incident. Thanks for helping me revisit my childhood.
omg 9,999,932 views
Plz do Korean War next
Please do the Hussite wars (1419-1436). I'd watch that over and over.
I randomly clcked this and im not disappointed
Definitely one of the funnier videos of yours I’ve seen, keep it up!
Do the Arab revolt
My recommendation is just-:pig = technoblade
13:33 LOL HE SAID 'PAY UP BOZO'
Outstanding!!  Keep them coming!!
37:19 Democracy :V
Do Vietnam.
Why is this so halirous 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
29:19
Can't wait to watch this vid 1000 times
The British Empire being stubborn about these little islands: You took my only food. Now I'm gonna starve.
Can you add Arabic translation
7:58  ''Somebody Once told me you touched my territory and did it over and over again on the brink of war canada and america they feel like hopping into a shed...''
When is a new video coming out
dont know where to put your boarders try straight line today!
Make one about suntzu
BYOOCANNON!!
Why does the pig look so much like Waddles from Gravity Falls.
Technically there is still a border dispute between Washington state and British Columbia, but further out at sea, but it hasn’t been resolved yet since it would set a precedent over other maritime borders.
You should do one one the syrian war
Please make a video about Indian Revolt of 1857 and the Nationalist Movement (1919 - 1947).
It really makes me wonder how the government hadn't dismissed Harney long before this dispute despite his record
Can you make a video about the war of 1812 because I’m it learning school
That last part tho 😂
I love the ending
Idea for your next video. "The clone wars" oversimplified.
This is probably my favorite oversimplified video I've seen it hundreds of times. It's my favorite mainly thanks to the ending. God bless you Oversimplified.
The last two minutes were possibly the best thing I've ever seen on this channel. 'Murica! Lol
I absolutely love this channel for all of the reasons that everyone has stated. But let me add just one more in case it hasn’t been added already. This guy may not have a lot of videos under his belt, but even in the early stages of his channel they were still very very good. The amount of research that goes into the subject matter that he’s covering is astonishing. This guy really takes care to not only make it funny, but also make it informative. Enclosing I will only say this. Well done oversimplified, well done.
The ending made me root for a US invasion of Canada 🇺🇲
Now over simplify why all roads lead to rome
now i know why you put on all that makeup and inject that botox and hold your head high for the sky to see you proud as can be ... look pretend we are on TV ... well its not entertainment its more like court TV for everything besdies you that ever is was or could be ... be proud of your assaultsz ... your A salts and A games and A ... you knpow where this goes
What even happened at the end
Canada? New Zealand and the Pacific Islands are less talked about
Flawed video, very lacking. Not mentioned in this video is the role played by man-bear-pigs in the pig war.
Lol Canada would win that war. Thrilled to learn some of my country's history on this channel, though :)
I would love a video about Frederick the Great
jsyk $100 in that time was worth ~$3,500 today
29:50 I don’t know why but I got De Ja Vu from this part
Do life the Elizabeth the first for your next video I need it for my GCSE history and your videos are so easy to learn things off
OMG OVERSIMPLIFIED SOUNDED SO CRAZY AT THE END OMG IVE NEVER SEEN THIS SIDE OF HIM 💀
Still waiting for Vietnam
PIG 😳😳😳😳😳😳
Am I the only one that noticed my man referenced smash mouths all star at 7:55
Oh my.
31:08 ... WTF!? LOL The oddest minute in my life! ... to date.
Hhh
hey do you think you could do a video of the crusades or the middle ages in europe?
Harney sounds a little bit like Trump.
i want moreeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!
um canada won the war of 1812
Finest YouTube Channel that deserves everything on the internet
In one of my lessons literally today my teacher put on this video  Amazing
Best video by these guys ever
Abraham Lincoln’s Presidential To-Do List:  1. Restore the Union.   2. Kick George B. McClellan in the shins.   3. Drop hat off at dry cleaners.    4. Grow a mustache?   5. San Juan Boundary Dispute.            Ahh Lincoln, you’ve always had very important things to do.
One day you should talk about the US military interventions in South America.
At least us brits never had this issue with any other islands...
37:07, best hot minute in oversimplified history.
Can you make video about 1971 war of India and Pakistan please
;-;
GUYS TRY HONEY ON APPLES ITS BUSSIN
You should do videos of Julius Caesar!
I know you will probably never see this message but if you aren't sure on what to do an episode of, you can do the czechoslovak legion, I think you would find it pretty interesting
I think us should invade Canada.., I would like to see raindeer  fighting abram tank
29:16 best part
At 4:14 i screamed "Michael Bay"
you took the ending to personal
Ya know the ending makes alot of great points maybe its time we take Canada for America for freedom for Wayne Gretzky ! 😂
Keep it up man!!!! And make a video about the attack on pearl harbour
Make a video on gulf war or six day war
I'm Canadian what if Canada and us join together
4:12-4:17 (While Laughing) That is not what God meant! For some reason I found this kind of funny.
Please cover the Spanish Civil War
Germany: What a nice day. USA and UK: WHO OWNS SAN JUAN ISLAND?!!! Germany: Oh sh!t.
Drake is coming with all the hot sauce
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
I love oversimplified's attention to detail, having the correct era's flag in place, love that
I don't wanna think about where Joe Biden has came let alone where he will
7:57 I think I know this quote. A little.
I literally slipped up and started watching this and I've laughed my ass off! SUBSCRIBED!!! and binge watching. 😂 Worry about your own curves Benjamin! Oooohhhhhhh 🤣🤣
what music did you use at 34:40?
he makes social studies fun
7:57 is the beginning of the best part
You're a straight up genius mate.  That was all time.
What if oversimpflied was a rejected teacher
"like rats or a virus" never have more truer words been spoken
32:42 ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH IVE BENN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS! I HATE YOU! IVE ALWAYS HATED YOU!  Me:😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
32:30 is funky
You should do the war of 1812 next since you glossed over it in this video
32:42
32:43
32:44
54 40 or fight!
Funniest part of this video was "Bidens coming" yea no he's not he's one of the worst presidents we've ever had.
wait the minutes is this how to make a war at the end of this video???? jk jk
The British don't get furious, we get pissed.
Can you do the war Of Mexico vs U.S.A
Carretera calle
This was so hilarious 😂
It's kind of sad Putting Biden at the end. Commander of Thief and the worse President in History But, Hey at least some people don't have to deal with mean Tweets from Orange man Bad
2 years ago, if he had posted this, it would immediately be banned because it mocks Biden. Now, no one likes Biden, and this video is more popular than ever before.
I am commenting because it's impossible to double-like a video.
Could you do the Zulu war
I love this channel.  And I love that I'm still immature enough to laugh at a good boobless joke.  14:28
seriously, this is the best history channel I've ever seen. you make history actually interesting and enjoyable. ty, keep up the great work!
You should do a vid about the great purge 1932-40
Very intertaining video
Oversimlpified comment section in a few years. *"But Oversimplified, you didn't start the great American invasion to Canada, the vikings did"*
As a washingtononian… the pig war was stupid
How dare you make light of something as important as Canada's freedom? I guess freedom of the people the U.S. has enslaved and suppressed throughout history is one big joke to you. I take it that you are not a first nations person.
Dude, can you upload all the videos again with spanish audio for mi amigos.
That ending tho
"It's not a mistake", ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
"It's not a mistake", ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Could you make a video on the Italian resurgence?
I would like to see a video like this on another famous US border dispute, the Toledo War.
If you don't familiar with 7:58 , sorry we can't be friends
Why don’t you aboard the glorious English revolution?
Make the Great Potato War of 1777
A more interesting question. Who do the Great Lakes belong to? US has Lake Michigan. We need to claim the rest of the Lakes.
"Id worry more about your curves Benjamin"
Please make a video on 7 years war 🙏
i want to be in your videos, i want british to win wild!! ♈️〰️♈️
You know, when you got to General Harney I perked up because I thought I was going to learn something cool and great about a potential ancestor. Buuuut, what I got is more guilt.
Did some say 1,369 sheep 69 69 69
Straight line?
37:23 mmmmm communism    *OUR* manifest destiny
Myanmar military coup - oversimplified plz
didnt make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
My man just got really patriótic there, good thing hes not Germán xD
ah yes, Winfield Scott, the real mvp
This has a lot less technoblade than I remember
A lot of this seems like stuff that could only happen in a movie but nope.... It's all real
Ah yes, an American official from 1854 shooting at a British official from 1854 with a gun that won't be invented for 100 years. Very historically accurate
I CANT HANDLE HOW AMERICAN THIS IS LIKE-
😅.....
plz oversimplify the crusades
Around this time the Utah war has also happened
I honestly don't know why I, as a Canadian, found that ending so hilarious 🤣
Bruh I ain’t even get a notification
Sorry to be a bummer but where does Oversimplified get his information from? Please i would like to know because i have homework due tomorrow and i want to use this video but i need to know the Sources. XD
37:15 Yeah, pretty sure we have more people in one branch of our military than their whole military combined
It's amazing how easily things can be solved when you put someone in charge that knows what they're doing, and get an impartial third party to decide
I find it ironic how this video is (as of now) the least veiwed video (likely due to its somewhat newness) just speaks to the consistent quality of this man.
Picket be like "We're here at the Rock Island Armory and today we'll be looking at the Czechoslovak Skorpion vz. 61."
37:15 Don't tempt us! We do like that tree juice they make...goes good with Bacon
This was hilarious and Informative. 10/10 for the Ad transition.
Awesome as always. That “Northern Irish Men Love Me” gag about British flags? That’s immortal.
14:35
23:12 comrade
Can we get a Oversimplified of maybe one of the greatest empires of the times? The Mongols and their downfall?
It's funny how the more you know about any country's history, the more contempt you have for the place.
OverSimplified making us feel like a 13 year old girl with that Biden pic in the end.
The ending was interesting
There should be a movie or series about this I don’t mind Micheal Bay it can be a alternate history movie and series too etc
Please make a video on the Persian gulf war/desert storm
hey oversimplified you should do the Ireland revolution next for videos
What an ending
This channel needs to branch off and do a politics simplified. I don't even bother reading or listening to anything political cuz I have to stop every 3 words and look up what everything means.
Hey can you a video about ancient Egyptians
here we are telling women to work at the kitchen...
There was 3 priests that were killed by native Americans but they do not say why and why they did it's because they raped some little girl and the white people made it out to be the native Americans did bad for killing people who raped little girls
humanity is actually brain-dead if war almost started from a bloody pig
This wouldve alternatively been the best and funniest war if the war happened actually all because some random guy shot a pig
Make on kargil war...
And before anyone asks, yes, it is the same Pickett of Pickett's Charge infamy, which, ironically, was not at all his fault, he was opposed to it, and was so disturbed by it that he drank himself to death by age 50,
في احد سعودي
And being American they pulled out their guns
Canadians: why you not talk about canada more?  Oversimplified: you mean state of Canada?
Teach the sino japanese war, where someone just take a shit almost started a war
Could you do a video about native americans? Im really interested in that part of history
I'm sure this is a long shot but I'd love a video on Getulio Vargas, former president of Brasil. To hit the highlights, he lost the Presidential Election in 1930 and a month before the winner is set to be innaugerated, he takes part in an insurrection and is made president. He then gives himself dictatorial powers, joind the Allies in WWII, and gets removed from power after 15 years by a different violent revolt in 1945. That same year, he gets elected Senator by TWO different states (but only assumes one) and 4 years later is reinstated as President after being democratically elected.
Bro, you don't even mention the Philippines 🇵🇭 in your vids.
29:15
Can we all give Pickett a nice thank you for that whole charge thing?
As of December 6, 2021, this is all the presidents that OverSimplified has made a reference to: George Washington John Adams Thomas Jefferson James Madison James Monroe Andrew Jackson James Polk James Buchanan Abraham Lincoln  Ulysses Grant Woodrow Wilson Warren Harding Herbert Hoover Franklin Roosevelt Harry Truman  Dwight Eisenhower John F Kennedy Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon Gerald Ford Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan George HW Bush Donald Trump Joe Biden
Best outro ever. Annex Canada 2022.
Can you please do a video of Spanish expansion into the Midwest? I've never seen a single youtube video done about it yet
31:04 lolllllllllllllllllllllllllllll most underrated thing in the whole video
Was the end a joke orrrr
I'm pursuing Medicine and I'm from India, literally this video doesn't relate to me at all but the way he explains these things it's so funny and creative at the same time I watch these a half an hour long videos.😂😂
I live in a part of the Fraser canyon that wasn't first visited by white people till 1808 with Simon Fraser going down the river and the canyon
Oversimplified should do the Korean War specially how 900 Filipino soldiers depend from 3 different sides against 40,000 soldiers of Chinese liberation.
Still waiting for a video on the Indian War of independence
u should make a video on the Vietnam war.
Did you really get freeman for this
i enjoy how half of this video is trying trying make americans feel guilty lmfao
Tô this day, historians still argue if YouTuber Oversimplified truly started the great Canada-America war
Talk about African history plz, they are so rich in history
Straight line? Straight line.

Jesus Christ loves you and everyone
12:23 Mr. Incredible is starting to get upset
Has he done the war of 1812 yet?
Can you do a Japanese history. I subbed.
My first act as president after conquering Canada would be to deport every single person from Quebec in the country. Watch that the France wouldn't even want them lol
I have watched this 7 times already but it's just so stupid
... I am not proud of the accomplishment of politics trough history and years that have ravage the land on those periods of times and these present, not even counting the ones that were already here in the first place and have lost their inheritance by means of fraud (they were deceived by a trifle). "There is shame and a burial from all those who pose themselves as strong with empty posture and unmitigated hopes for ambition and power breaking the covenant of not fulfilled vows"
I couldn't stop laughing at the end of the video
38:19 YAAAAAAA
I like all the bits with the modern and old fashioned crossovers.
i have a video idea talk about the spanish civil war
37:10  New HOI4 DLC: Manifest Destiny available 2022 (it does sound like a promotional video for a HOI4 DLC tho lmao)
Mole mole
Indian revolution and colonial British rule pls
7:55 the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming they hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running
Canada might have lost the Island in the end... But it's still larger than the USA ...just without San Juan. 😆
Biden couldnt invade his own dementia medicine bottle.
Will oversimplified do any asian and south east asian histories?
really cool but can you do a video of the "the great depression"
The last 3 minutes of this video was epic hilariocity!!! Well done Oversimplified- you’re the best channel on YouTube
That ending is just a Dude... uncool moment
Hey ! What software do you use to draw that? i want to know pls ;-;

Just found out about the ending monologue and its fire
Video idea: vietnam
7:57 legendary

Just, so freaking great content!
Watch out we’re coming 😈
3:54 I hear voices all the time. Sounds pretty normal for the year

The british are so much more peacefull than the Americans!😂
Better not come knocking oversimp’d. Or we’ll burn down your white-house for a second time!
Ever since I learned about this in APUSh this has stood as my favorite moment in all of history. I’m so glad to see it played out in the same humorous manner I played it out in my head.
I love the way you say "rather" lmao
Its actually proven that if the Americans had ceded the river to the Hudson’s Bay Company, the British may have helped the Union in the American Civil War.
I wanna see oversimplified: the January 6th capitol riot, might make for a funny and interesting video
The end of this video is just gives all the chaotic energy the I need. It is the most chaotic thing that I ve seen recently!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👀👀👀👀
That is probably the best outro I've ever seen on YouTube.
CAN YOU PLEASE DO LAFYETT PLEASE
Always great, I wonder if we will get a Sioux war over simplified 👀

Can you do the segregation/ Civil rights act?
Ah man, Washington could have been part of Canada.
Hey How bout doin a American-Fil war
why did u literally try to declare an unnecessary war on Canada.
You should do a video covering the unification of the British Isles
Oh boy.
Could you Oversimplify the Great Depression Period, and also the Russian Civil War??
31:02 IS THIS MORGAN FREEMAN'S VOICE? DID YOU GET MORGAN FREEMAN TO DO A VOICE CAMEO ON YOUR VIDEO?
God the end made throw up! Haha no thank you from a Canadian!
Oh eh you getting a we bit power hungry there eh bud
Lyman cocked his gun twice
That Sheriff part made me laugh while drinking water and now my nose hurts
Those islands are most assuredly American though
Cuban missile Crisis oversimplified!
North Montana forever
Ok the cold war gag would def fit in at 5:21 like :”In the north the british set up a communist nation while in the south the Americans set up an anticommunist nation. Both were led by very sweet looking old people. But dont let that decieve you. They were both ruthless dictatiors and both wanted to reunite under their own regime” that running gag
Best history Channel on YouTube by Far♥️♥️  Pls try do a Vietnam war video next 🙏
The ending is underrated
31:06 I thought he was able to get Morgan freeman to voice that part but then I saw it was someone else at the end
37:20 Oversimplified: CANADIAN TROOPS = 0 Me: well it turned to 1 now 🔫🔫
Hello, to you random person reading this comment i just wanna let you know that God loves you and you should also always love yourself no matter the circumstance
I have a video idea for you: Chernobyl - OverSimplified
Yu didet menten canada
You should do Vietnam war
This guy: this video was made possible by nordvpn me: this video was made possible by britain
bruh you forgot ottawa
Its kinda scary to think about how my province could have been under American control it just makes me shutter thanks brits for protecting the island
This is one of the weirdest wars
HELLO GLUBBOS
37:19  Well that was a heated speech
When "Look at those curves" has become a running Gag for me and my Girlfriend for different Things
petition for the next video to be Vietnam just like here     ||  ||  || \/
Eastern channel owned by USA, Western channel owned by UK.
Hello Mr. Oversimpified, this is Parth Gupta from India.... I would like to say that the Treaty of Oregon would be reffering to the Eastern Channel as it is 50-50 situation
3:38- Inshallah, Mashallah, the Americans probably lol
36:00 YAAAAAAAYYYYY YAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY YYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We only know how to move west. Plus those canadians are pretty chill.
Make a video on greek or roman wars
Vietnam war when
when is your new video coming??
Will nord VPN also not make it so people can't see me googling hot Russian signals in my area?
President Drake actually isn’t a bad idea
Please say Scott really did whip that idiot with his belt. Pretty please.
as a American i can say just about all jokes about America aren't true i still love them
Look at Sheriff Barnes calculator upside-down before he hits it with his head.  I promise you won't regret it. 14:28
Can you do a video on the Franco-Prussian war or the Wars of German Unification
Ok so I just realized that this isn’t the first time Oversimplified has referenced America taking Canada. In part 2 of the WW2 video at the beginning when he explains how Britain wasn’t alone and instead had the commonwealth nations support, a US flag was over Canada before quickly being changed.  And to that I say cool Easter egg and Canadians know that your time will be up soon. For you will all be Americans.
> Imagine not believing in manifest destiny.  > pretending Biden is based
Wow great ad spot lmao
It must suck to work really hard to become President of the United States only to blow it and go down in history as the worst President and a coward.
This and Prohibition are my absolute favourite videos from oversimplified.
Do a Vietnam War video next
18:20  You could’ve left it at “all natural”
make the Vietnam war
The Space Race (1955-1975)
I have 3 Berkshire pigs right now. So I can give my smallest, Hammy. To griffin for “consolation”
32:45
32:45 😂😂😂
Mf owns NordVPN
free heatlh care lol
Hey did anybody realize iversimpifed anthem was……….THE FRENCH ANTHEM?????
But it was just a suggestion
Do spanish civil war please
@oversimplified you haven't talked abt Indian wars and unification by Ashoka. Also, Kautilyan strategy defeated Alexander the great! A video on that would be grt.
Potato rockin' some "sound" kicks there i noticed
Usa  did  never  invaid  canada
you should do the korean war or war of 1812 or like other stuff my dude
The almost-war enraged General Windfeild Scott, who punished them severely.
General Harney looks like Biden.
[1] Can you make a video on 2000 - 2017 (Millennium era)
I’m not filled with an overflowing desire for America to invade Canada. Biden if you do this I am switching my political party.
i cant wait for the next oversimplified video! i love your work!
I wonder if a episode about  Genghis Khan will come out. I have a feeling that Genghis and Napoleon would be good friends
Can you make a vid about the gulf war🤞🏻🤞🏻
Y'know, it's both depressing and reassuring that people in positions of power acting pig-headed (pardon the pun) over stupid shit is just part of history. It's not just us here and now, we're ALWAYS this close to the brink of destruction!
All Candians at the end of the video:Shiver me timbers
Can you do the Texas revolution
the end. bwaaaahahahaaa
That end was hilarious
The beginning of this video and the beginning of the American Civil War video is showing America’s expansion out west with two completely different issues.
USA cant even invade poor countries like Vietnam and Afghanistan, they have 0 chance against Canada.
History, for dummies.
Can you do the Irish revolution for one of your next videos plz I’m already following
Can you please make a video on the balkan war .
do a video about the ottoman empire and it's rise
When are you going to do a Vietnam vid?
One Nation under God, yo, let's do this!!
And then the US invaded Canada... get completly lost in the big woods... and the war gos on for 20 years but with no battles because no one can find the enamy. XD
I like the videos very much. I just wished it didn't contain sexist jokes like "you princess" or "cry like a little girl"
Biden’s not the president
Can you talk about Philippines?
Maybe you could do the Chinese Civil War on they be the collapse of the Soviet Union in your next video
the americans keep coming and they dont stop coming hopped in there waggons and hit the ground running
hey oversimplified can you pls do 55 days at peking or maybe the mongolian empire
Biden NOT coming baby He's got  Alzheimer's disease
Please do the vietnam war or atleast consider it
38:30 Biden coming :D :D ????!  Funniest thing i ever heard since Biden was elected :D
yes new vid
That was awesomely hilarious.  I can't wait to assign this as a future lesson in one of my classes.
Once again, this is absolutely brilliant!
Can you do a video about Indian Independence
I've heard too many Canadians saying they'd be ok with joining America.
Vietnam?
I'd love to see one on the battle of Britain
37:20 wow. I feel like this speech and just how it was done with that mighty speaking can turn even an Albanian a American nationalist!
Hey @OverSimplified wouldn't it be a good video idea if you make something for the Balkan wars. Really like the way you explain things in your videos. Stay safe!
Something about Texas coming soon hopefully?
*watches video of PNW circa 1850's* Wow, those people were so effing stupi.... *looks out window at PNW circa 2020's* .... Nevermind, I guess some things never change.
Damn, that was fenaminal.
But Oversimplified, neither the British nor the Americans discovered those islands, the Vikings did.
make a vietnam war vid
Can you make a video on India
8 mins in and this is my fav video so far alr
Eh, Biden just starved the US. How the hell are you planning to invade Canada?
Do a furry war animation
OMG THE QUOTE "Whoa whoa I didn't say they are WHITE people" IT GETS ME💀
PO TA TOES Boil em Mash em Stick em up my
I’ve recently found this channel and I am addicted! Absolutely incredible content. Highly entertaining and gives me the exact perspective I want on history.
hey oversimplified, great video and I look forward to more of them, my suggestion would be the punic wars or caesar's campaign in gaul.
The best YouTube channel in the history of mankind!
1:05 the rap battle
35:23 I thought west Virginia was on the union side
Cant believe I've watched this this 10 times now, just for the ending 😅😅
Oversimplify the Balkan Wars?

33:32 IVE ALWAYS HATED YOU.
AN U PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ P,Z P,Z PLZ DO AN IRISH EASTERN RISING OF 1916 AND 1920. IT WOULD BE SO INTERESTING
"Negotiate with sheep? Are you crazy?" *"I'M PERFECTLY STABLE YOU RATBAG! CALL ME CRAZY AGAIN AND I'LL EAT YOUR EYES!!!"*
Nord  is a capitalism gremlin in this channel and I love it.
I hope you guys do invade us. Finally our gas prices won’t be based on over seas oil prices and our failure to take advantage of our vast supply that we also don’t even refine our selves.
I’ve watched all your videos 10 times, your videos have taught me so much more than my history class. GOD BLESS YOU
Pov evrybody at the and: 😐

Hi why dont you talk about india at all we are offended 😀
Hi
I feel like you forgot to mention the ongoing war on the pig wars actual Wikipedia page. Its a titanic struggle between the moderators and the people.
Well its actually english territory since americans are english who wanted independence so technically it is english territory
hhi
5:40 wind can blow in two different directions?
Day 1 of asking OverSimplified to make a video on Irish independence.
Has anyone else noticed the Russian flag between the two American flags between 0:23 and 0:52?
Veitnam war pls?
Do the zulu war next oversimplified please
To be honest, if the USA had started war with the British in the mid or late 19th century the USA would have stopped to exist. Probably the Station Forces in Canada would have roled up the whole US Army and non existent US Navy of the 19 the century.
I lived there till I was 7
Im still waiting for sengoku Jidai oversimplified.  :))))
Wait a fucking minute.  Since when did a skin color ever stopped a person from expanding his empire.
based
Do a yugo wars (im from slovenia)
BAAAAAAAAA
3:53 "It was billy right? *"I thought it was Sharon's cat"*
Umm, are you alright? You sounded a little conquer-happy at the end!
vid for russo jap war pls
Can you do about male work war?
'Straight line?" is my go to suggestion for all conflict solutions going forward
Better ending than Emu War.
37:09 eh bud that’s quite the ambition eh? Let’s settle down with some timmies you’ll be back to normal in no time bud!
Can we get a video on the Taiping rebellion?
Your vids are classic. If I had access to your vids when I was sub teaching I would have used them big time👍🏽
Love your videos! They're always both super fun and educational. Are you able to do one on the history of the Caribbean Islands?
I like the idea that the nord VPN character is a supernatural being that can shape shift and can become anyone and it just waits around to be able to advertise nord VPN. I also like to think that nord VPN itself is supernatural and can stop secret letters from generals from getting intercepted by the enemy like as suggested by other sponsored segments in videos.
The only problem with invading Canada is others will declare war on America
00:48, i just noticed the dudes arm in the back of the crowd moving
His content is so addictive but the only one problem is that he post very rarely
Loved your channel for years...  As a Canadian... Utterly brilliant!  Hats off to you good sirs!
Can we get the Vietnam war OverSimplified
1. I love your content you are so good and so hilarious 2. Could you done a video or few on the Habsburgs? :D Cheers and hope your 2022 start is a good one!
You should do the riot now!
I want to hear the story of cleopatra and julius ceasar. Very interesting too
nahhhh he uploads after 7 months? NAHHH
Oversimplified Critic Canada:  Me:Can You Talk More About México? Please 👉🏼👈🏼?
Oh no, i'm scared now...
America and Canada are basically siblings at this point. We help facilitate their trade, and they supply us with that sweet, delicious maple goodness. Could've gone without Justin Bieber though, and I think Canada kinda feels bad for doing that to us.
Idea: Oversimplified American Civil Rights Movement
7:57
7:57 Historically accurate Smash Mouth-infused references are why I stay subscribed.
you should do oversimplified videos about the ancient world from Egypt to Babylon to Greece and finally Rome  I mean that kind of stuff is hard to find online but u could try pls
This is one of my favorite historical topics
Oversimplified can you do the battle of hastings
The pig was a national treasure, im crying in Canadian
Maybe you can do a face reval when you hit 10 million subs
Man your so funny :) I’m a fan
MILK
Anyone notice the almost-unwatchable anachronism at 22:18? It shows Harney's letter going through the Panama Canal, which wasn't built until about 30 years after the Civil War. And they had trains/Pony Express too, so the letter could probably have just been delivered over land.
Can u do something on Indian history too??
Will we ever see a video about the Swedish empire?
Manifesting Destiny 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
These videos CRACK ME UP 🤣🤣😂🤣
Real content creators 👏👏
Stopped watching halfway and quickly opened the google maps to spoil my self lol
Plis do a polish bolshevik War
Really makes you wonder how many wars throughout history were started by something as small as a farm animal being killed snowballing into a bigger conflict.
Pls be a teacher
Will you do  a oversimplified video of the Afghanistan/Iraq war against America
Mung man
Do the watermelon war (got the idea from a YT'er named AustinMcConell)
more oversimplified and more often oversimplified!
This was the most hilarious episode of Oversimplified so far, I enjoyed it so much!! Thanks for always serving the best historical content
I'd love to see a video about Bismarck and German unification!
I can't wait for oversimplified to make a video about the YouTube war
3:31 if the west is americas ass, what is florida?
Hes back
This outro almost made me want US to invade Canada
Parliaments 'n politics in a nutshell:  10:23
U r sicotic
What I like about these videos is that they often make me want to know more. In this case I noticed a tiny peninsula on American soil. It is called point Roberts and was also a point of discussion during this period.
Will you ever do the Vietnam war?
@31:46 I like how innocent the potato Spuddy looks
We are all worms but I believe that I'm a glow worm:-P
Majapahit Empire please
13:59 is 2 funny omg
like you made american independence you can also make indian independence from british its a huge topic but good too                                       LOVE FROM INDIA
6 months
Hey where's the Vietnam video that you promised
We want Vietnam War!!!!
So educational and funny too 😂😂😂
I wanna see Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and Hannibal Barca next
Welp, i’m still waiting for vietnam war
What's the name of the song that starts at 36:37?
I loved the part where General Scott beat the crap out of Harney. Lmao
Do vietnam
20:47 My man!
Please make a video about the Puerto Rican Nationalist Movement!!! Dr. Albizu Campos, who was tortured and murdered by the US government, the shooting in the Congress in 1954, the Nationalist Heroes, the Ponce massacre, the time the US Army shot at a building full of civilians because they thought there were Nationalists hiding there! The murders at Cerro Maravilla! So much awesome history! Puerto Rico is STILL a colony! It is one of the worlds oldest colonies.
Canada!!!!!!!
for the new oversimplified plush why not you make uniforms like from the civil war or WW2
Dude, you are amazing!!!
4:10 Bruh
Lets be real He explains better than all of our teachers
“Endless comments that say that I don’t talk about Canada enough in my videos!”  He said that with so much emotion that’s gotta be personal 😂😂  Also it’s at 38:00 if y’all wanna rewatch lol
I love the part at 7:25 it's the bane of my existence
This is your best video so far!!! Amazing work!!!
why's pickett just Ian Mccollum from forgotten weapons
both sides need to leave
What are we gonna do with Canada? :l
Please like this so he can see it but please, THE WAR OF 1812
Who needs history lessons and bbc bitesize when you’ve got this guy!
1:24
1:25
1:26 Benjamin Franklin has no curves LOL
WHAT. THE. HELL. FOR. JOE. BIDEN?
who draw the maps for nord vpn,then
Love how in 16:01 he pulls out an ak but is actually american xd
Finally, my hometown of Vancouver is mentioned in a video
dear god...your videos are amazing. I love this channel.
I loved the ending more than anyingthing I have see on youtube to date
Sorry oversimplified, I don't think Biden would declare war on Canada for you, honestly I'm not sure he even knows what he's doing on a day to day basis, I'm starting to think his mind is degrading with age... And that's not considering what I thought of him beforehand
At the end of the video I just wanna Canada has never lost a war and the British will help us so what us
upload turkish war of independence
You’re going way too overboard with the “ruthless American imperialism” bs. As far as the Us government was concerned, the land out west was filled with sparsely populated tribes who didn’t even believe in land ownership. Land changed hands throughout history. Get over it and stop acting like the US was any exception.  Also, Native killed Buffalo too. In vast quantities.
Canada is the 51st state
Pickett's Charge makes so much more sense now.
do the seven years war next
How about Lucifer, Oversimplified
When is coming Croatia and Serbia war video....
Shut up
In india two royal states of bikaner and nagaur went on war due to a watermelon that was sown on bikaneri farm and the fruit was on nagaur's farm
The pigs look like waddles from gravity falls
Next vid should be about Mao Zedong
Oversimplified should be the only history class taught at every university, in every city, of every country, on the entire planet.
Ok. How about Afganistan war oversimplified? News in russia make it so unclear what happened there recently.
Still trying to figure out how Europe took over the world aka white people.
Well, who got their way? Yeah. Thats what I thought.
Amazing video, probably my favorite you've made so far
then end of this video is one of the funniest things i ever seen in my life!
Do something on India's fight for independence I feel like people need to know about the struggle
Man, That was hilarious. I was in stitches when Winfield Scott beat up Harney with the words "Alright You psychopath, I've been waiting years for this!"   Would be cool to see you do a series about the great northern war. There are some really interesting characters in there and it's the original version of "It got cold, Stupid cold"
Vietnam War when
@oversimplified How's about the Korean war?
what if  Biden watched this video and invaded Canada the chances are 99.9
"he hated superiors" 'he wanted to become president"
Just a man and his potato.  I lost my shit
Some how I feel like the what the f- during the nord sponsorship was the most genuine what the f-s ever
Can you please make British Raj in India. Waiting for so long
6:03 i like to :D
What I expected: The pig was merely an overhyped myth like the bucket war. Reality: Dear god.... What is wrong with people.
Any indian watching this!?😂😂
No not the pig.
The war started coz of a pig
Such high quality videos
Oversimplified please do romans or ancient civilizations...!
Potatoes or Pigs? Which is tastier? Let’s discuss? Keep the conversation civil and polite. Have a great discussion guys.
I’m a Canadian and I promise you if the US invaded Canada it would be guerrilla warfare Vietnam’s way of beating the US
PPLLEAAAASSEEE CREATE MORE CONTENT 😭😭😭
“Discrepancy Detected?” -Inspector Oversimplified Glory to Arstotzka!
America is packin at 3:33
There’s nothing early American map makers loved more than a straight line. Those fuckers loved them some straight lines. Mountains in the way? Straight line. River in the way? Straight line. It doesn’t matter what was in the way no boundary was too much for a straight line to handle.
If country A burns country B’s capital down during a war is sounds like country B lost. As a occupant of country B I feel like we deserved a L for that one.
Wait wait wait… I didn’t say they were whites people  THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE!!!!
could we maybe get stalin oversimplifed just asking- i would love to learn more about him this way
Watched all of that just to conclude with a bunch of fucking America first bullshit, Jesus Christ Canada is a great country, the US is a great country, just let them both be!
English civil war or war of the roses
Guys this is fake all servers are    hacked from 2018  and nord VPN
Can you cover some Indian war. There are so many of that
Did Harney's letter time travel through the Panama Canal?
29:19 Is my favorite.
“Lyman if you spare my life, I will grant you 3 wishes- auuuughgg!” - Oversimplified
My goodness that last part was truly patriotic
I want a plushie of that Berkshire pig
You should do the American-Mexican war
8:01 nice little shrek reference :)
18:40 did he just pump a double barrel shot gun?
Do a video on the war of 1812
Please make a video on ussr collapse
That Benjamin Franklin bit made me press like
..... it was tried bud. Don't make us come down there and burn the White house thrice.
Saying the war of 1812 was a draw is probably the only incorrect thing you’ve ever said.
5:35 how is the wind blowing both ways?
What if you did make a episode of the 80 year war? It has a lot of interesting story's.
This man trying to start a war with Canada to make more videos 😂
So, the hero of this story is...Kaiser Wilhelm I 😃😄😁😆
u could invade canada, but that would certainly piss off the brits and the other europeans. not good for american business.
Can you do a Korean war,Vietnam war,or WWI
this is the stupidest part of history i've never heard of
I thought at 14:28 its how much he owes in todays money but just to find out it says boobies lol
Canada: "What? You want to invade us? That's against International Law, besides..."  US BRAIN: "OK,man, you can have them, but play nice, maybe diplomacy or trade would be an intelligent way. Play nice and be cool..."  US: "I declare war"  US BRAIN: SACREEEE BLEEEEEU.
If there's one video you could make that would also be kind of topical is the Brazilian Vaccine Riot
The uk
I have to say, 40 minutes on a border-dispute that never quite turned into a war, does somewhat stretch the meaning of the word "oversimplified"....  Oh, and don't get me wrong, this wasn't meant as criticism. I absolutely love not just the format and delivery of your videos, but very much also the quality of the research which goes in to them. There's many a "documentary" one can find on the U-tube which isn't nearly as informative (or even truthfull), let alone able to capture their audience in such a lovely and smart way. From me, for this channel only kudos.....  .... and the occasional quip of course.
Are you going to do the war of 1812.
The best ending of a YouTube video ever!!!!! Laughed so hard
Good video! I have a request. Can you do a video on the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars as a Mini-Wars video please? It would give a good insight into the dark times of the Russian Federation and struggles we had to endure within borders.
THATS THE WAY WHICH THINGS ARE EH
At some point, after reaching some significant milestone (5 or 10 years on youtube), he should definitely consider remaking the WW1 and WW2 videos and give them the complexity of his more recent videos.
Please don’t invade Canada. I like my house, and I don’t want to be drafted...please don’t make me die for this shit stain of a country
Will there be any videos about Julius Caesar?
Do one of the Korean warrr
Oh god I love the white accuracy
3:40 lol
An early American proposal was that the border would continue along the 54 parallel. That would mean that Alaska and the mainland would be very, very close, if not connected.  Kind of insane to think about that much of Canada being owned by America.
Happy new year OverSimplified!  Please do the Great Schism of 1054 and Reformation Oversimplified.  Thank you!!!
Now Post regular videos my comrade
14:58 what is the background music
Have anyone noticed the islands belong to mexico
Biden get em!
Can you make a video about Roman empire
And oversimplified took his Canadian fans and beat them severely.
Any one noticed the Vietnam map on the table on 8:50 ? Maybe the next episode is about Vietnam War???
Does anyone know of a channel that follows a similar style but on subjects like science, english, or even social stories?
PIGS EVEN
Could you do the Mexican revolution? Please?🇲🇽
Longest Video of Oversimplified
When is the next video?
The potato had Sonic’s shoes
Love the channel, can I put in a request for the crimean war please :-)
Can you please do some Roman
When are you doing a video about the Vietnam War? Soon I hope! Love the vids
I love how at 33:15 you can see him hiding behind the door, he knew what was gonna happen
Amazing videos and voiceover. I would just cut down on voice vibrato  completely.
you have gone to far to thinking about to invade Canada
Made video about yugoslav wars
Do a video about the rise and fall of the Zulus in South Africa
You've just earned another subscriber
Woah.. the pig talked..  That too in the most godly angelic voice possible
George Pickett is the walking definition of ninnyhammer
I'm not used to hearing the Narration get so, extreme. As a Canadian I find the ending REALLY Funny.  "One United Nantion under the leadership of our Glorius President, Drake!" That line hit me hard
37:08 the best outro
everytime i see a new video i just think about when aang came back
By far the best ending to any oversimplified video ever
Do you have videos about Crusades War?
hahaha florida was that stick figure's dong
I'm all for invading Canada.
Anybody else giggle like an idiot when he made the "all-star" reference?
3:32 … your welcome lads
anyone else notice the map of vietnam war on the table to the left when the 2 boundary council guys thing screen was playing? vietnam war next maybe hopefully
Me during all this: How do they come up with these land names?!
“Not the curtain again mr President!” This guy is awesome and I will never stop watching these videos,keep up the great work!
Hey you Canadian s yes you Canada is America now in tux paint
Love the End. Thats my Type of humour ngl
12:23 mr incredible becoming uncanny faze two music
Non-American anglos stay losing
COULD YOU PLS DO ONE ON PERSIA AND HOW IT BECAME IRAN!! ❤️
Guys, don’t tell him Canada is actually good at war.
You should do vietnam
I’m noticing a definite shift in the tone of these that I’m not a huge fan of. Stellar content so far but this might be the one that jumped the shark.
19:10
okay,kinda mean at the end about canada(big fan still.Also i support biden
OverSimplified can you do oversimplified Alexander The Great
No, Imagine Biden waving the Canadian Flag! YES! ALL HAIL CANADA!!! The Canadian McDonald’s! YES!!!
If we attack Canada, we will get a long over due 210 revenge
Definitely do Alexander the Great next huh? He conquered the Persian empire.
I'd worry less about Canadas curves and more about your own  curves -Some British person
I could just imagine him making a video on the break up of Yugoslavia.
"Americans were comming, they hit the wagon and they made ground running"...........dope lyrics dude
Alexander the great please
"Carretera Calle", "Fugazi Tony's Pizza", and "Top Hats /And Even Topper Boots" are very interesting location names lol
Love this guy. I have never really been in to history but I watch every time this guy posts
Perhaps you could make an episode on history of Yugoslavia (or about Josip Broz Tito)... Could be interesting to some hardcore Tito fans...
Biden🤡 is coming 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that sounds so not threatening. He probably forgets which country he is supposed to invade and shits his pant and invades Mexico. We will be just fine ☺️
After i saw that ending, I started sleeping with a pointy stick
Please do Ancient Greece or the Vietnam war
I can’t believe I only just noticed that America said “density” instead of “destiny” at 3:37.
do you 100 years war🥺
America 🇺🇸: declares war over an animal  Australia 🇦🇺: Hey I’ve seen this one
I wish you will make a video about Egyptian history
This video was way funnier than it had any right to be.  The stupidity of this situation combined with the wonderful comedic presentation from Over Simplified was simply masterful.
I have never laughed this much at America in my life 😂
the end made me CRY
0:40 so that’s really funny >:(
So... Baynes/Hornby content when? /j
32:25 is the funny
I thought this was something about Technoblade.
Don’t know why but this video compared to the others are less good, usually i watch again and again OverSimplified videos because i love to rewatch them but i watched this one only one time and doesn’t want to watch it again. Maybe its the subject of the video or others things i can’t say
i love that this premiered on my birthday :D
As a born and bred Newfoundlander, I just wanna point out one minor mistake. Newfoundland itself is actually the island off the east coast, the section marked as "Newfoundland" in the video is actually Labrador. Now, my history is a little rusty so maybe Labrador wasn't a thing when all the territory disputes were happening but it still felt like something I needed to mention.
7:57 Seamless All Stars reference
mole,3 😂😂😂
33:22 Lmao you can still see him behind the door
Having spent many summer days on the San Juan Islands I never knew the history. Incredible. - From, Seattle
"But, being an American, he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife."
4:11 I love my country.
Please do Vietnam War!!!
The Buchanan part is quite accurate.
The final assumption made me laugh🤣
32:22 you’re an idiot speechees of Winfield Scott 33:24 Harney get wrecked by Winfield Scott
28:38 Curtain Coward Buchanan
what is the difference in borders that they were fighting for. 27:27
12:54 too brutal dude calm down
Please franco-prussian war next
16:29 What sound is this
>before the pig >pig >military escalation
I am Australian so I do not care
This went off the rails at the end there, eh?
BEST VIDEO EVERRRRRR!!!!
Hey why not make a mongol empire story
The pigs face looks a lot like the pigs face from Gravity Falls
Hey i have a video idea for you. As you dont really much talk about India in your videos, you do a video on The Indian Partition or The Kashmir War. These were the most tragic times in history and it would be nice to see your side.
Pls make videos on Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan wars that US has fought. Also something on the colonialization of world by European countries.
German empire hated the British empire so why would they give it to them
The song is at 8:00
Hi if it's not to much ask can you make a video about Lithuania
I bet the vegan teacher will hate this “war” bec of a causality of a pig
Actually since at the time of the treaty the land was unclaimed therefore neither party owned it. And therefore the treaty clearly stated AROUND the channel no in any one specific direction.
I wish they used these videos when I was in school.
Petition to over simplified to make Vietnam War  Vote if you want to   ↓
what will your next video be about?
Please oversimplify  the Nigerian civil war please
Nice, please make a video on the crusades.
Yo can you do "the right hundred" ww2 pls

I love it
Good video . lol ,Saludos de México
The ending tho
3:32 Florida no!
Damn this is good!!!
The end was funny
Everyone thinks god is on there side

You failed to mention that the US government maintains the British flag where their camp was to this day.
37:15 OverSimplifieds patriotic speech
that be the way in which things are in which the way things are . -a sheriff
that be the way in which things are in which the way things are  GET OFF MY PROPERTY
He should make a video on the seven years war
So wait, thinking about it, what about what Canada did to the natives?
15:47 pause, on the left you can see a map of the Vietnam war, I think this image might be part of the Vietnam war video in the future, please tell me in the future if I am correct.
Coi cái này hề vãi
I can’t get it out of my head… JOE BIDENS COMING… AND HES COMING WITH A VVVVEEEEENNNNGGGGAAAANNNCCCEEEE!!!” Lmao every upload you can tell he gets into the voice acting more and more
idk this was a cringe comment
7:58 where the meme is from
"Like rats or disease."  Woah that is a roast right there.
Finally I knew he was making a big collar for the whole 7 months of WAITING
<3 i love you overly simplified senpai, plz notice me
Every time I watch these videos it makes me realize we are only here for such a short time.. I may as well buy that “thing” I want
At 10:27 omg my sides hurt
I’m a Canadian and it kinda hurts when oversimplified is saying that Canada sucks(disclaimer:I’m just 11 years old and maybe I don’t know a lot ok)
i have never enjoyed an ad before until i watched this video....
Could you one day do a video on the Boxer Rebellion?
Anyone else notice the one map on the table during the discussion of splitting Oregon Country up is of Vietnam! Maybe that’s a hint to the next video.
Would love to see you do the ussr
Hoot,hoot.
ww3 2022
The usa
Theus
You have no idea just how much i love your videos
I have never laughed harder in my life at the end
Can you do: The Zulu War The Vietnam War The Mexican American War The Gilded Age The Crusades Símon Bolivar and Gran Columbia The Renaissance The Paraguay War The Reconstruction Period The Civil Rights Movement Jone of Arc and The Colonial Age Please Por Favor???
I would love to see some stuff on the Roman Empire!
I live near Seattle and I have visited the San Juan islands a few times. They are not worth fighting over.
37:18 - 38:21 Dear god, that’s too much and more of a patriotic Mode   (Btw, Not really sure of Biden will invade Canada But besides that Nice video)
I am waiting your video for months, and watching this i could wait for another
You did the pig war... Why not talk about the COLD, ops, COD WAR?? Iceland will get ALL the ocean of the world if it continue to happens!!!
People living in the west and you know your not white: Shit....
Future generations will ask how WW3 started... I submit 37:17 of this video as the spark.  Bring it on eh?
the pig wasnt the only to die spuddy and the potatoes died
4:10-4:16 is probably my favourite 6 seconds of internet
Oh man，where is Chinese subtitles？
The look of confusion, terror, fear and disorientation on captian hunt's face in this scene is unforgetable 33:29
Do Idi amin... please
The correct way to watch is 2x the speed.
We’re not going to start a war because a of oversimplified video with our greatest Neighbor.
I like 🇨🇦  And I’m a American 🇺🇸
3:32 that’s just a Florida shaped penis.
Ya see, this video just confirms that the United State’s a plague.
If you listen closely to the crowd when the guy asks “And who was it that spoke to God?” they say the most random things  “Wasn’t it Bob?” “I thought it was Sheryl’s cat!” “Well, I hear voices all the time”
33:56 Amazing how the lack of a incompetent, stubborn, warmongering buffoon in charge changes people
Oversimplified ftw knowledge and comedy all in one video
Can you make a video about breakup of Yugoslavia
Ottoman austira war

Could you do Oversimplified Yugoslav Wars? Well you can do it or not
Moral of the story: Apparently in early America nobody liked to share or split things down the middle even though that was entirely fair.
Still waiting for Sengoku Era to get oversimplified
where did you dissappear for 7 months!?!?
33:28  For a man who couldn’t get into a boat without being lifted into a basket, he sure does have a beating arm. Also his face is how you say “a man who deals with a a lot of bullshit or pig shit to be more accurate “
It's funny that you song all star but with America
Will we ever see Hong Kong handover oversimplified?
so cool!!! really enjoyed the video! especially the manifest destiny for canada!!
Ok but fr, could you imagine how scary America would be if it invaded Canada and literally doubled its size and got more living space and recourses?
9:20 Where did you get this image of Nigel Farage? 🤣
_-Britain didn’t want to fight to continue economic relations with America_ _-America didn’t want to fight because they were already fighting_ *The most American thing ever…*
14:30
"Sleep with one eye open" [Me who's watching this because I can't sleep] 👀👀👀👀👀
1:45 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸
Nah the US just can't even bother to start it
43000 comments, holy sheet
The ending is that funny only because the US and Canada have such a good relesionship, imagine how horrible that would be if he talked about mexico
1:25 childisch meams... jeah... im 25 and now you lost my respect and attention
i am in india
MURICA BOUTA LIBERATEE CANERDA

You should do a video in the Balkan wars
Time for my daily dose of history I probably won’t learn in school
Oversimplified, how long does it take you to animate your videos? Ive always wanted to learn how to animate but never really had the time, also your videos are the best! I love it when the americans pull out their guns and say yee ha
lol

I'm sorry but what's that little tune playing at 7:25 where Vancouver says "truly british"
I think the islands belong to canada
That guy carrying that McDonalds 😂😂😂😂😂
As always, its worth the wait.
Make oversimplified Chinese civil war
Yes, invade Canada. Incite the most brutal guerilla warfare campaign in American History. Incite another war with the British Empire. Good luck with that.   (good video tho other then that ending)
The only thing Biden is coming for is a clean diaper
The Canada rant was priceless
The pig standing up was scary
You should do a video on Alexander hamilton
Bruh that group meeting came out blasting make my day 😂
Honestly I’m a Canadian And the end of the video was really disrespectful to us Canadians and you were my favourite History teacher…
New cover the Mexican-American War.

Can you do a potato war for a joke?
37:20 - 38:43 Oversimplified do u have any sanity left
The soon to be famed charge of the 27th moose brigade will save Canada from annexation
You should do a 2 part series about the history of the US national park service
Could you make a vid about the polish-russian war
ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS I HATE YOU I'VE ALWAYS HATED YOU            oh boy i wish they made a painting about him beating up harney, if he even beat up harney
6:04 i didn't know that Oversimplified plays Honkai Impact..
Nordvpn looks interesting
bruh, i don’t know if you got a team or if you actually do everything solo, but the only regretable or sad part about your videos is that the uploads are so apart one from another as the 4th of jully is from christmass
"Biden's coming baby, and this time he's coming with a vengeance." 😂
Please do the Russian revolution oversimplified
Buchanan was truly the worst president
Ye but more contrys will nack canada then the us

We’re not going to conquer Canada with Joe Biden
Hey your videos are really funny but also really educational. Will you ever make more?
Guys we need to get ready to invade Canada
3.38 Its Its my Destiny Not density.
I like how Captain Pickett has a Major General’s insignia on his shoulder
Canada would still beet the usa even these days
Yes i missed the “this video was made possible by nord vpn”
We need the Balkans war next
Mom taking you to her work place where she dance for dollar bills ain't nothing to brag about.
LONG LIVE PRESIDENT DRAKE
i like how Americans on one hand preach international peace and self determination and on the other hand are low key on board with imperialist narcissism
"It was British territory." No, it wasn't.
America >>>>
Biden's coming? No worries then Canada, he will get confused, lost and end up bombing Iceland instead.
31:02
All Star Reference 7:58🤣
Leave potatoes alone:-(
He lowkey hates us canadians :(
Can we please have new videos weekly
His face when the Americans arrived cracked me up
*Dream’s Stans have entered the chat*
37:00  DON'T YOU EVEN FREAKING THINK ABOUT!!! You may think were "weak" but we're stronger than you could possibly know!
...and french speaking Americans who randomly mix english to their way of speaking or whatever
Me waiting for Vietnam war:
Make a video about the mongol empire
Doesn’t Pickett become a general?
I know Biden will do it.
Do the Martian war next
only in america smh
Watched this with my crush and now she’s my girlfriend
How stupid is mut you be to start a war over shooing a pig. I would have stated it sooner.
I know you get millions of people asking things like this, but: are you ever gonna do videos on the Franco-Prussian war or The Mexican-American war?
Can you over simplified Genghis Khan'
When new video?
Not gunna lie, I disagree with the idea that it was a draw, because if you think about it, Canada's main focus was keeping the Americans, OUT. And we succeeded at that, so in a way we won.
Petition to get oversimplified to do Vietnam war !
Any chances of a OverSimplified video about the end of the Roman Republic and the creation of the Roman empire?
I see what you did there with the calculator at 14:29 if you turn it upside down
That monologs at the end was fucking hilarious
4:14 That's the most american thing I've ever seen
Hey Oversimplified is it okay if you can do a video on the Romainian Revolution
Can you do Philippines American war
Well you my friend need NordVPN

"i've got my spotted dick" -OverSimplified 2021
Every single Canadian after wathing the ending:  *chucles* im in danger
don't quote me on this, but i think that the americans kept coming and they didnt stop coming, hopping in their wagons and they hit the ground running- It didn't make sense to keep sharing oregon, when they outnumbered the british more than six to one
Some one unsubscribed me from you wtf
Really fun video!
Britain realising that america could be the axis forces in the ww3: pull the lever to activate the giant spaceship full of every british folk and get the heck outta here "kronk"
Even tho this war was stupid, i totally agree for the british to take the islands
video suggestion : The Baltic Fleet during Russo-Japanese War
The end gave me cramps from laughing so hard.
I actually learned something about the shared territory when I read about the history of Oregon. The video definitely makes it a little clearer to understand. 😄
You have to make a lot more of these I am soooooo hooked. Please never stop making these. Pleeeeeeeeeeease!!!!!!!
Oversimplified you make great vídeos but that whole invading Canada thing is INSANE
lmfao the ending😂
Or the Spanish Civil War
36:57
Over Simplified you should do the Russian Civil War
.... Are you ok? You're concerning us.
That was some brilliant voice acting in the end  Also "with their affordable insulin" was hilarious
When is the next vid?
Could you do a video on the Great Leap Forward in China?
You should do a video on the Korean War  but take your time because I know these take awhile to give these videos the love they need and the quality
Canada's monopoly money will become the U.S currency
3:53 "I thought it was Sharon's cat" ! Arp arp arp arp you got me rolling man:)
4:12 lololol I loved this
Civil wars next? Sri lankan war ltte fighting for equality and freedom against sri lankan army who are killing families for no reason?
14:25
It's cool to know that the war has Americans in the name of the war!
"I hear voices all the time" the ending was pretty troll. Biden can't even form a sentence let alone invade canada lmao
Surprised no one is talking in the comments about how he sang all stars lol
Plz make a vietnam war or korean war video
You should do over simplified Vietnam conflict
Men! Lets have a pitition that History class in school should be taught like this.
Please don't invade Canada.
"As a native american. This is the reason why I straightly punch a white Karen in the face when she said 'GO BACK TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY'." -pocahontas
3:33 America bricked up
Best outro on all of youtube
7:26 you thought this was British
this video is so woke
As a young man I was with Y.A.C.C. Camp Cascades, Sedro Woolley,Wash. We were fixing American Camp,British Camp San Juan island. I know the story.The English pig ate the American garden cabbage. The English and American had dinners and dances. Not a shot was fired. Civil war soldiers from both sides Pickens, A.P.Hill were there and wanted to fight. Portland was at one time the border. In 1888 a coin toss by Kaiser William gave the islands and Puget Sound to America.
Canada's response: "Bring it." 😉
I'm not even american nor canadian, and this was fantastic to watch. learned a lot!
Hey when  try to get the plush it says it’s can’t find it on the website
This is the funniest video you've made yet. 10/10!
I don’t think America will invade Canada because Canada is part of NATO and the UN
"Those flocks of wooly cowards" 😅
Video ideas: 1. The Vietnam War 2. The Korean War 3. The French and Indian war
Do Vietnam war
Fun fact: the pig is the only character with legs that move
But, why Joe Biden 🤣
His voice is so fascinating and the style he explains in ☺
this video goes hard
oversimplified Vietnam next?
Just crazy good.
7:48 started sku ding like a rap
I live in British Columbia this is so interesting
Still waiting for the Vietnam War Oversimplified
"I'm not gonna be the one who starts a war!"  How many wars could have been prevented if we had generals and admirals say this to their leaders whenever the leaders wanted war? So much death and destruction could have been prevented.
😂 😂 😂 😂
Hey oversimplified why don't you do the Korean war
Save our bacon SOB coincidence I THINK NOT
Fun Fact. The Columbia River Bar, is the most dangerous river bar crossing in the world. Claiming many ships and souls. There's a fun kitties maritime museum in Astoria if any of y'all are interested.
The Pig War. The original pilot episode to the simpsons.
Dad: Doesn’t want a dog.  Family: Gets a dog anyways.  The dad and the dog: 19:12
As a Canadian the end was Scarry. LoL
Usa war of pig like Poland war of cow
29:33 yellow journalism
Dare to make a video on the most controversial war of the Indian history?

I love how you can transform any history lesson into a fun and entertaining video
I'd love to have Pangea oversimplified.....you know, for a friend.

Me: Sees the ending  *Pulls out maple syrup gun* Bring it, eh.
Could you do the Vietnam War next? It would really be sweet :D
32:28 Sorry it’s for my use
Please the "Vietnam War" next...i've been waiting for 2 years...
Eyyy Lake of the woods where you either need a boat or to drive through cananda to get to part of Minnesota. Why does the border split Rainy Lake in half instead of being on one shore or the other?
19:28 that was the worst thing he could’ve said probably worse than slandering griffin
get rekt
Can you make Philippines American war
Can you do a video about the finnish sniper häyhä
me a romainian:oh noooooooooooo anyways

7:57 The American keep coming and they don’t stop coming they hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running
That's right canadians! watch your backs! sleep with one eyes open tonight!.... hahahaha I almost died laughing in that part.... OverSimplified you're the best!
7:57
Canada could use some freedom
Well done with the advertisement
Do the balkan wars
What I learned from this is everyone is an idiot
My goodness i didnt expect the ending to be like that
*first video by oversimplified that's not in 2 parts*
There will be a dark era when oversimplified will have no more wars to talk about ;-;
7:25 For anyone that was wondering, this is the National Emblem March
And they don't stop coming!
26:25 I see what you did there.
Can you tell story about Afghan war ?
Am I the only person who saw Spuddy the potato is wearing Sonic the hedgehog shoes?????
Time to take Canada, I'm ready
I think having general Harney as grandpa should be amazing
dude he’s become such a good voice actor since this channel started. this channel has shown so much improvement every video
Greek revolution please
Wait biden is going to invade myyy countryy
0:46 right on the nose 🤣🤣
I'd like to see him cover Canadian military history
OVER R U A LEFTIE??????????????????????????????????????? I THINK YOU ARE.
Can you do the Angolan wars
15:39 you can see a map of Vietnam on the table
Funny enough, this little conflict had a lower death toll than the COLD WAR!
Legend has it that if You pause and read the pop-up adds and browser history you will be blessed with good luck for the next 10 years
Well I mean American Canada has a ring to it
The ending has me like USA USA USA USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸
The potato's voices like Sesame Street Ernie.
Ending had me laughing
Please do a video on Idi Amin
how to make history fun step 1. oversimplified
i think oversimplified likes the idea of a u.s invasion of canada
anyone watching in 2022???
Oversimplified continues to raise the bar. This is phenomenal content. Thank you. Keep it up. I love it.
Biden: Time to dispose of the half rate wannabe Trudeau: I wonder who that is
Thought i got bored.....awesome.
Happy new year form one of your Canadian friends 😏
Can you do one on the Yugoslavia wars?
GUYS IT IS CALLED THE OINK OINK WAR
I like how this took longer than the WW2 series.
Vietnam War tbh
0:13 looks exactly like an oversimplified snowman :)
I had to double check with the vpn if you posted a video between now and the 7months back incase I missed a few  I always get so excited when I see you have a new video
Boy, that phrase "In a 100 years who will care?" really doesn't apply to this General Harney fella, as it's been almost 200 years and historians still discuss his stupidity
would definitely love a video covering the Korean war and the attributions that the US and China had to it
7:55
The day America successfully invades Canada and Drake becomes President is gonna be like when Kanye said he’d run for office
Next Philippine–American War pls
Poor Griffin…
Oversimplified War of 1812
I want to see oversimplified 7 years war
Most accurate British Parliament ever. And this is from a Scottish person
Can you do the Korean War
33:20 - 33:36 best part
Just noticed, "it's my density" not destiny.
I have watched this video at least 10 times it's brilliant 👏 👌
That ending 10/10
Help me I’m dying
Ah yes nothing like spending your New Year watching over simplified
Did he shot a pig the sounded like Morgan freeman
I for one, think the islands should be independent.
The ending is just too funny!!!
Do a video about the Iraqi-Iranian war plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
@5:54, that was a SMOOTH transition. Nicely done.
18:37 the pig wasn't the only casualty poor spuddy also died
3:38 gotta shoutout the BTTF reference
Thing is people, Canada has been a mostly peaceful country in its history so it’s difficult for him to find stories big enough for him to make a video out of.
thats not general hanrey thats general hide the pain Harold
I like how it has this star wars cover  Also It was funny how the British roasted Franklin about his fatness
"I hear voices all the time"...
Humanity is idiotic!
Can you make an oversimplified video about Hamilton pleeeeeeeeez
1:52 Look on the table and you can see a picture of Vietnam. Maybe the Vietnam War is next. And oversimplified is hinting at it.
Those were definitely some nice spuds.
Thank you oversimplified, for giving me a little more wholesome joy in my life :)
10:54
16:10 to 16:36 is my fav
I love how he pump actioned a rifle Lmao
Historians still contest what it is OverSimplified is trying to do here by starting a war with Canada: 1) Maybe he wants to expand America's territory 2) Maybe he wants to be a hero so he can become president But there is one thing everyone can agree on.
What the f
Straight line everybody?
Dear Oversimplified,   Vietnam War when
Good thing I'm not in Canada or I would have to be paying for healthcare after the US invades there at some point.
Funny in the end.
Straight line - straight line
This whole video's design was his manifesto against Canadians.
Never before have I seen American AND English culture so accurately portrayed
Please make a video one the seven years war
After years of trying to explain people's stupidity this guy at the end himself ...........Went stupid!
Union (To Harney): We'll pay you to join the Confederate Army Confederacy (to Harney): We'll pay you double to stay in the Union Army
You can't have Canada
is the author of oversimplified canadian? I am noticing some bias here
i love this guy lmao
14:29 I just hope you are not eating or drinking while watching this part. You may die.
Love the star wars thumbnail. Also why not invade Mexico too? Heck, why not all of central america? Why not take the Caribbean too?
This is my favourite part of this video: 7:57 - 8:06
Happy New Year!!!
Do poland video
Do poland video
Do poland video
Do poland video
I can’t believe I spent 40 minutes of my life learning about a war almost caused by the shooting of a pig
Americans will think it’s so easy… then they will hear the bagpipes…. Then they will be sent running
Why is harney holds the blue saber when he is the antogonist?
Please make a video on “hunt for the Bismarck”
Eh...don't wanna get conquered?  Be stronger.  Anything wants to live, something else has to die.  Can't be changed.
You make history so much more fun and interesting. It is hard to not laugh to your videos.
watching this after watching Don't Look Up makes me finally lose hope in humanity
We’re Canadians really saying that you didn’t mention Canada enough? Im sorry on their behalf Oversimplified.
Oh no our home lol
Canadians: You need to put more attention to Canada!  Oversimplified: You mean North USA?
7:59 All star?
This channel is "fool proof".
Yes, good
Oversimplified rome would be a cool series
DO VIETNAM WAR THAT VIETNAM WINS
Pickets scared anime face always gets me

8:03 “when they outnumbered the brits more than 6-1” *then it is an even fight*
I came here cos I thot it was about technoblade
37:17 oversimplified you gotta chill man
"When the Americans showed up in the British camp to plant their flag they couldn't because the British took the flagpole"  The pettiness of this dispute is just epic
Hey you should do one about New Zealand
Don't worry Canada. Russia will nuke us long before we invade you. Thanks to Biden
hey oversimplified are you canadian or something because you say rather kinda funny like a british person but u make american history videos a lot
As a Canadian,  I take this as an insult
Do Spanish-Philippine war next 😂
Greatest oversimplified finale yet
please no. i dont want joe bidome to get me in my sleep i didnt do nothing-eh? you fricky wicky.
What do you mean sacrifice his audience?? I’m Canadian and that was the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
I was wondering if you ever thought to do a Great Depression oversimplified
Kerbal space program music 15:45
This was well worth the over half a year wait
The funny part of that vid is when Gen. Winfield Scott call Gen. Harney a psychopath. The fact is, that word doesnt exist on those times
Next: Vietnam war (or WW3?)
The reaction to the pig death is like Minecraft players reacting to another person killing their dog
You should do gulf war or vietnam war next!
WTF man
Hey oversimplified. You should make a video about Pol Pot
I don’t think anyone wants to see my search history, especially hackers
Lmao , this is great you've outdone yourself. 😂😂😂
Damn! We should have steamrolled into Canada when we had the chance the u.s. war machine was hungry and that's alot of beautiful country with alot of natural resources.. imagine having all that Canadian population with us. I'm sure they would have loved it as well, all those guns the Canadians could have owned. Also we would've had a greater country. Damn our forefathers fucked up. Canadians don't have the stomach for war we could have won. 2 yrs after the Mexican war was over in summer I would have invaded! Divide and conquer my son that's how wars are won and nations built...send the Brits back across the pond with their asses in hand.given the chance they would do it to us. Ohh yeah that's right they did. At least we got what we did.
I would give anything if he did a video about the Balkan wars in the 90s
This guy does Sam o’nella justice
Settlers: God definitely said this is what we’re meant to do, right? God: Show mercy and compassion to one another. Settlers: **already genociding**
One of the best history sources on the internet AND it's free.
28:37 this has to be one of his best animated joke sketches hahaha
I’m all for taking over Canada
I love how it’s not completely Bias towards America and is actually accurate
I argued that the middle would be right
who else keeps rewatching the ending lol
oh wow, i remember reading a small snippet about this in a book I have: "Strange Stories, Amazing Facts from America's Past". one thing's for sure, this video will DEFINITELY bring it to light!(especially because after only 24 days, it already has almost 9 million views)
*All American* Somebody once told me the west was gong to roll me,  We ain't the sharpest tool in the West Douglas looking kinda dumb with flag and biting his thumb  Thinking of Oregon being for the British  But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming,  Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running  Didn't make sense to share Oregon When we outnumbered the Brits more than 6 to 1  So much to do, so much to see So whats wrong with settling  We never knew if we didn't go San Juan wouldn't be ours if we didn't go  Hey now we're Americans, get your Destiny on, go settle Hey now you're British, get off our Islands, go leave All those Islands are ours Only shooting pigs to defend our crops  Its a cool place, and they say it gets better You're bored now just wait till the war  But the British Navy begged to differ Judging by insanity of the leaders in the big picture  The ice Harney Skates is getting pretty thin  Sent Pickett to the island, and his ranks were spread thin Disputed territory is almost on fire, how bout yours That's the way we like it and we never get bored  Hey now we're Americans, get your Destiny on, go settle Hey now you're British, get off our Islands, go leave All those Islands are ours Only shooting pigs to defend our crops  Go for the Islands Go for the Islands Go for the Islands G..Go...Go for the Islands   Hey now we're Americans, get your Destiny on, go settle Hey now you're British, get off our Islands, go leave All those Islands are ours Only shooting pigs   Brits asked Buchanan if he'd explain what just happened  They need some clarity  Buchanan cowarded, and sent Scott To deal with Harney, instead of himself Cause the situation could use a little Change  Well, the British warships start coming and they don't stop coming  American tourists hopped in their boats and wagons and they hit the ground running  Didn't make sense to start a war  When the repercussions would of been dumb   But there's so little to do so much to see Whats wrong with starting a war over some islands We wont know cause it didn't go Hot but instead it went cold    Hey now we're Americans, get your Destiny on, go settle Hey now you're British, get off our Islands, go leave All those Islands are ours Only shooting pigs   All those Islands are ours, Only shooting pigs to defend our crops
It seems Oversimplified(USA) _wants_ Canada a little *too* much.
The NordVPN character looks like he has blue hair
1859 : war because of a pig. 2022 : war because of outro of oversimplified history video
While you're  at it how bout we raid Mexico, won't  need a wall if it's part of the country.
Greatest Ending Ever!!!
the NordVPN segway...chef's kiss
Willem Defo plays Mr Douglas in the movie
My first thought is Technoblade
You totally should do video about some ancient civilization (egypt,greece,rome,mesopothamia)
THE BUCKETTTT
Kinda wish we could give Washington, Oregon and California to some other country at this point!
Do the war for texas next
2318008. Nice.
oversimplified is the youtube chad
I'm saddened to see nobody noticed that the pig is Waddles from Gravity Falls
27:25 "whether the US-Canada border looked liked this... Or like *THIS*" Pure comedy gold
Let’s go Brandon?
There are so many examples of "see america, youve always been like this" that i cant even count them anymore lmao.
I forgot this channel existed
This is oversimplified’s masterpiece.  I’ve watched this so many times and it’s still entertaining.  Oh and I learned something too.
The ending was (wait for it.....) legendary.
That reveal that captain pickett is the same pickett from the pickett's charge is the a really holy shit moments for me
7:56 Banger
I really love how much it’s implied Griffin had relations with his pig, which is most likely true.
The ending... is actually.... true...
30:27 "Ok, everyone! Get over here!" He would have come to them, but his gout was acting up.
I have 5 suggestions for wars that he could make a video on. Those wars are: The Texan War of Independence from Mexico. The Mexican-American War. The Chinese Civil War. The War of The Triple Alliance. The Korean War.
Can we get a "President Donald Trump" Oversimplified? I just wanna see how he'd draw him
Way to go with the patriotic speech at the end of the video
19:20 isint that the medic laugh from tf2
When are you going to do the Balkan wars???
😂😂😂 hey it could happend.
He should do apartheid next
General Oversimplified, I still have not received the go-ahead order to run into Canada with my friends, guns a-blazing, when will we get the order, we've been sitting here for I don't even know how long.
Was that a declaration of war?!
What’s the song they use at 16:28
This was a great video, and some critical questions I have was why didn’t we split the land? It would have been a easier solution to the problem, we could have rewrote the paper to divide the boundary again so it wasn’t such a dispute, why was  Harney not put up against a firing squad for his insubordination long before this? Why could the shooting of the pig agreement be negotiated better? Baynes was amazing at bringing this situation under control but it shouldn’t have even reached that point. These are just my opinions and observations, you can agree or disagree on them but I believe it didn’t need to go this far.
You officially are the voice of God in my head. ❤❤❤❤❤ dddddooooooo nooooooo!!!!!!! 😅😅😅😅
its the right one for the border
The Spanish civil war next
Everyone send technoblade this
I think im getting tricked into learning history            I regret nothing
Coolest ending ever though.
Could you please upload more ? :( 💖💖🦆🦆
Anyone got the link for the national emblem Oversimplified used?
WW3 will be america trying to invade canada xD
I would love it if you could do some about Belgium. Where france and Holland where constant at war with each other.... would be great. :)
Bro, please make a video on India and Pakistan's independence, war, and dispute with the British.

So now you've done the pig war can you do the bore war next. 😊
Hope you do the Vietnam war next still waiting on that vid
I have rewatched the ending so many times and it gets me every single time. It's that perfect level of what I like. It's right on that level of "Ohio conquers the united states and canada. Look out Europe, you're next" and later "balistic missile inbound, do not seek shelter, your end is here ohioan"
38:12 "I am here to announce, that the United States will be invading uhhhh.... You know, the thing?"
Oversimplifed what about the korean war or the vietnam war
It would be interesting to talk about its history being that person can be used to believe in many gods do you want
You have not made a video about it yet
Can you please talk about Thailand
tldr: pigs and more pigs
Ok I know the Canada part was a joke but I’m still gonna spout out some issues: 1. The UN and NATO would attack you for attacking a NATO country 2. Canadians are scary during wars 3. If a power suddenly takes over and no one wants it, a resistance will always be formed
0:53 the music fading out has become almost a trademark of OverSimplified
That ending was hilarious!!!
Timestamps for me: 33:23
7:57 for fun
Your channel is the bane of my APUSH teacher's existence because u keep covering things he wanted to do lessons on. The name Oversimplified strikes fear into the hearts of our History Department
And subscribed
Oversimplified: has that ending Biden: .....I'm not touching this
Affordable insulin my ass
31:02 The pig’s voice is so cute, I wish it was used more often throughout the rest of the video instead of just this one scene.
Loved it
the ending deserves its place in the national records
Rip Pig
you should make a song called hopped in there wagon's from the video its so catchy :) X3
Tbh, really think adopting Canada's territories one by one as States is a great idea.
I want to see Balkan wars oversimplified please :)
Sorry but I dont like brain tumor surgery (aka bts)
But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop going hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon.
I would love it if oversimplified it video and Catherine the great, it be so funny 🤣
A-are we jus gonna gloss over that end part?
7:57
"IT'S MY DENSITY!" lol almost missed that
16:11 XD XD XD
you and nord are best friends
POV: you are from Canada and here that last part  ;-;
0 to 100   real quick at the end
37:08 - 38:20 American imperialism in a nutshell
Pig eats potato, man pumps his smoothbore muzzle loader, nearly starts a war.
You should look at the Texas revolution
5:56 if anyone has watched spiderman homecoming they know what vibes im getting
Taiping rebellion, pls!!! 😅
Is it just me or is it that general Pickett looks like the guy from Forgotten Weapons?
Pickett: "Thank god my men and I didn't get blown up. Anyway, I hear Pennsylvania is nice this time of year."
anyone else notice that the pig looks like Waddles from Gravity Falls?
Fantastic ending :)
14:35
"But, being an American he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife" I died at this lol
Americans really be like  14:04
do the wars of the netherlands and england they often kept their wars on the water
That Ending man
The US lost the 1812 war. It wasn't a draw.
More good good video love it
You should totally make a remastered version of your WW1 videos. Both parts.
The NordVPN character is genius and hilarious, especially his laugh! I always watch the NordVPN plugs on these videos.
37:10 and onward made me lose myself
love the ending
thank you for making history fun and the emding had me laughing till i cried
i thought that last part was a rise of kingdoms ad segway
Oversimplified where’s the Vietnam video at man??? We’re waiting for the video
So the Americans won the war by just being Americans
Et le Québec?
Please do Russian cuvil war!

Biden coming at a snails pace and going in the wrong direction and then giving up hahaha.
The enclave does not support the invasion of Canada besides Canada is as useless as siberia
31:03 Damn did he do a Morgan Freeman impression or hire the guy?
love how he racks a double barrel shotgun
Hold on.... Was it the Americans or the British that named it "San Juan" as opposed to "Saint John" Island?
"The place was rammed with sheep." Lol  Also, poor Hawaiians. Can't see them willingly wanting to go raise sheep in Canada.
5:56
OK the end had me laughing my butt off LOL
can you do a video about the Chinese Revolution
1:53 Vietnam war spoiler on the table?
lol  just gets done killing white british people "oh no, we can't kill white people" stupid video is stupid
Me: *proceeds to skip the NordVPN part* Him: *mentions BTS* Me: *concentrated* 6:21
The pig in this episode looks a lot like Waddles in Gravity Falls.
Do dday
this was the funniest episode :D
I feel like personally dragging your country into a war with a major world power is the kind of thing you get shot for
Alright Canada..your move
I laughed out loud with the "Let's go out there and make the world a better place" scene.  These videos are so great.
7:59  Don’t know why I like that
Make a video about the life of Hannibal Barca
3:33 America gets a dick :D
You should do a animated history of vietnam and war
Do a video on the Fenian Raids!!!!!!!!!!
But the americans keep coming and they don't stop coming
The Americans just keep coming in they don’t stop coming
I'm happy one of the best episodes yet was about my home state
Dude, I liked history before, but since I found your channel I fell in love with it. Your way of basically teaching history is fun and makes the information sink in a lot better. Keep it up my guy =D
Pls make a video
I feel like Canadian bacon has it's origin in this conflict.
please do vietnam war or yugoslavia next!
Canada: We burned down the white house. US: Oh yah? So did we. Canada: . . . o_O Cool bro, You keep doing you.
UPLOAD!
Porky looks like Waddles from Gravity Falls.
Rip the pig and spuddy🥲
Could you do winter war
Now The Mexican War pls
Typical entitled Americans
Please never stop making videos I love watching your videos it make history so funny an you keep it accurate too they should really use these in school to introduce the next lesson
I didn’t say they were white ppl 😂
can you do the vietnam war vs usa like u remember in cold war part 2?
NEW VIDEO :O
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregan, when they outnumbered the Brits more then six to one."                                                   -Oversimplified 2021  7:57   ʳᵉᵃˡˡʸ ᵍᵒᵒᵈ ᵃˡˡ ˢᵗᵃʳ ʳᵉᶠᵉʳᵉⁿᶜᵉ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ
How can I go to the alternate universe where USA and Britain went to war, and Britain won. A world where Canada would own America. A world where at the top of the Empire State Building stood the mighty red and white flag of Canada. A world where that one mountain would have Canadian leaders instead of American. A world, where my nation is powerful and glorious. How do I do that everyone
37:26 no thanks. These all are bad ideas 😂😂😂
I’m pretty sure now that racism is only allowed when it’s talking about the past
Bro, you need to make more videos. Vietnam is a good place to continue. Either way, your videos are awesome.
i love the stereotype of Americans literally pulling guns out of their asses like cmon man, we use holsters and pockets not complete weirdos well maybe in California.....
Imperialist america is the name of the united states of America
I may be Canadian but that ending made me laugh and scared at the same time
The San Juan Islands, as they are now known, are amazing. Lopez Island is my favorite but they’re all beautiful.
It’s like invading Russia in the winter it just can’t be done
I am still waiting for the Vietnam war video
That's quite a dramatic reading for the end. Didn't know you were capable of that.
A video about an almost war because of the death of a pig...causing a war in North America, what irony that would be.
No mention of Arthur Currie? Wuss.
Oh the northwest angle we love you so
Canadians burned down the White House. Britan helped significantly, but it was at bare minimum 60% Canadian military.
Dude, you should do the Punic Wars if only to cover Hannibal marching those elephants over the Alps.
I’d love to see a video about the Korean War! The historical issues, the interference of other countries, South Korea’s speedy recovery, etc!
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When will you do the Vietnam War? 🇻🇳 🇺🇸
Ig
One moment it’s like this is made by China and the British and the other is like it’s made by Alabama. Sounds like horse shit
5:10 the map shows north and south Vietnam so maybe the next video is the Vietnam war
i dont like the realistic art style. the dumb cartoony one is best
Could you do the Austrian Prussian war
Vietnam war next??
Thanks for this video.
I like how griffin screams 19:32
The San Juan Islands belong to America because they have the highest concentration of Bald Eagles than anywhere else in the Contiguous 48 💪  True story
Great work of art!!! Loved it!! The only casualty was the 🐖 pig... Hey!! I wrote the word 🐖 pig and Trumpy Jessica grumpy name popped up... 🤣🤣🤣✌️✌️🤣🤣🤣
i live in Montreal and you scared me
8:44
America still as annoying today as they were back in the day.
General Scott: We have peace, do not start anything with Pickett. General Harney: Imma act like I didn’t hear that.
I forgive him for the end (A Canadian)
Rooting pig+potatoes+gun=almost war
You should do the war of 1812 next
Talk about Serbians man. I barely have seen you talk about south Slavic nations. So come on!!! Make a video about us slavs
its say the mid channel
NATO won’t exist and america will be out number and out matches if we attack Canada so yea ask nato
Love it that the brits have bad teeths
Manifest destiny is just a retitle of to the conqueror go the spoils. It's rite of conquest and it was done for centuries, it is how most every nation was formed.
Dude...insuline was made by romanians...uncool
Why does pickett look like Sirius black?
what a glorious outro
Wow
bodybuilding and staring war
And there's no way I'll ever agree to it!

From iran,we love your videos...
3:37  Density too I suppose
If I had a nickel for every character in an Oversimplified video that was racked with gout.      I would have two nickels...
When are you gonna talk about Canada and find one
Reply to this comment or I’ll eat your eyes
The US couldn’t invade Canada for the same reasons of back when this happened.
13:11 and 13:30 made me die laughing
I love it when Oversimplified screams.
15:18 why am I thinking of ram ranch?
7:58 THE AMERICANS KEPT COMING AND THEY DONT STOP COMING
the end of the video was clearly the funniest part

Apparently your life would have been much better under British rule.  America sux, right?

I think oversimplified got a bit drunk at the end of that
8:26 ireland isn’t Britain
Can't wait for more past wars or events that nearly led to war for something so dumb...
Talk about a real BOAR-der dispute.
34:39 Look at Number 2 that totally makes sense 🤣🤣
There's less than 0.2% chance you'll read this comment but I just wanna say, I love your videos. Keep it up!
As a german, i can't complain beeing mentioned not enought... Don't know if that is good or bad...
the Island is closer to fucking Canada it‘s that damn simple but NooOoO
The only man who made history simple and interesting. Love you man from India!!
7:55
Can you do a video about JFK's assassination and explaining why he got killed?
Maybe next video you can do The Roman Empire-Oversimplified
We've made it, guys. Oversimplified has finally lost his sanity.
37:19 Star Spangled banner start playing
Pls make a video about the creation of Austria-Hungary.
I've never laughed this much while watching a history video 😂 This is an absolute gem
Try making a series for the Indian Revolution
Sorry mr president. We need to stop this important meeting. Oversimplified just uploaded
Love me some history. Especialy the odd, little known stuff. A well told tale of events good sir. And that ending. *chefs kiss*   I'd be worried about Biden comeing to my country too.

THE ISLANDS ARE AMERICAN
At someone who lives on San Juan Island and consistently puts pork shoulder in my slow cooker, the idea of American mounties sounds good to me! Victoria is next! WOOO
7:58 Smashroll
Ngl, the last part of this video surprised me and was funny as hell. Well done, Oversimplified.
Considering the disputes Americans and the Brits have had over the years and despite the comment's you will read between Americans and Brits they are pretty much shoulder to shoulder when they have to go fight.
I am guessing he voted Biden in the last election...
I tried the pig tactic in War Thunder and asked a T-34-85 to spare me in exchange for three wishes.  I ended up like the pig.
When are we gonna get a video on the Mexican-American war
Fantastic video . hillarious, made my day
Hey OverSimplified: why only Canada: Cancun needs to come to papa, heck! Why not just annex the whole of the Americas! .... and no were not respecting so called sovereignty of territories who still bear a European flag.... this means you Falklands, a McDonald's will be opening soon close to you... fish and chips can stay but they'll have to be sold by Long Jhon Sylvers and were changing the name of Chips to French Fries even if they are Belgian since both speak French so I guess that makes them French too and chips are crisps in the USA 'cause..... we say so! Long live the USA!
I subconsciously saluted during the ending
Are you dream from minecraft
I find it interesting how it's one person narrating and making every character speak. It feels like it's multiple voice actors who are speaking but nope it's just oversimplified alone, really cool.
37:08 You're welcome
Buchanan!!! Wwhhooooaaaaahhh!! Hilarious omgosh.
After watching the video over I just realised what Florida is... 3:31
Let's go Brandon!
I've been watching your video for almost 2 years and idk why I'm giggle when you mentioned bts. anyways, stream permission to dance!
I mean… he has a point
And who spoke to God? Shannon's cat. This made me laugh like a madman :D
At 8:53 there seems to be a face on map at bottom of screen 🧐🧐
Oversimplified: *makes a whole speech about invading Canada.* Southamerica: *eats popcorn* go head, make my day.
Lets face it the us has always been a country about profit... and expansion, sometimes it actually makes me angry
It's official. Oversimplified has lost his sanity.
7:57 Oversimplified sings all star
31:02 what is this referencing?
6:28: The first pop-up ad states, "This video took so long, I thought this would be about Vietnam!"  So...
Bro please talk about the cambodian cuvil war
Imperialism is better than tribal cannibalism
Can you make Julius Caesar video Thanks
please make a video on british conquest of south asia and independence of india, pakistan and Bangladesh
7:57 oversimplified sing all star by shrek
1860 pig war 2022 youtube video war
Can we do without inherit bias in the material?
so hey arnold had a v accurate summary then lol
having a war during corona is certainty is a bad factor but that didn't stop troops from ww1 and 2 from fighting
Before Trump, there was Harney!
PS You should upload more often. I love these!!! Fun way to learn about history.
That ending was hilarious 😂
Ýyyyyyyyyyeesdddssssssssd! Love the ending, I thought it was an ad bt now. So happy I watch to the end
12:06
7:57
Is this the best Oversimplified video?🤔. I think so. Ahead of Napoleonic Wars and Prohibition in my humble opinion
HOW DID I MISS THIS 💀💀
Korean war
Korean war
It's amazing how often satirical over the top jokes about American patriotism give me unironic patriotic feelings
Korean war
Korean war
Korean war
Korean war
Korean war
It might (not) surprise you to know this, but the Pentagon does keep plans to invade Canada on file. Actually, it keeps plans to invade _every_ country on file, but Canada's in there too.
Can you do Franco Prussian war
Me imagine if a war revolved around some hillbilly killing a cute pig    Over simplified: hello there
OverSimplifed could you do a video about the Korean War and Vietam War?
I love these videos man
18:40 no one going to mention he cocks a musket like a shotgun?
18:12
It's time to our finish Manifest Destiny! Canada your next!
hha
7:57
As a Canadian (whose birthday just so happens to be on the day this video was released), I find the ending simultaneously hilarious and utterly terrifying!
all canadians here please remeber that Canadian history is boring.
"Who was it who spoke to god?" *noise noise "i thought it was Sharon's cat" noise "i hear voices all the time"*
can you do japanese history？ i have a exam coming up next year and watching your vidoes made my history grades higher.
I'd like to see oversimplified do the Crimean war, Vietnam, Yugoslavia or Iraq.
What is the song used when the Americans are being shown
33:30 General WS 🤜General Harney
You should do the wolf west
Harney: Hunt you’re fired, Pickett you’re going back on the island 33:30 This angered Winfield Scott who punished Harney severely
I just found our your channel a few days ago and it has been a treat. Could I suggest you to do oversimplified video on Anglo-Burmese war please?
You know when it says Wayne Gretzky waving the American flag on 4th of July in Montreal? Well he lives in Phoenix Arizona. Lol😂🤣😂🤣
When a invaded country beats back the aggressor and doesn't lose any territory that's called a win. Might wanna look up the definition of a draw
its already been a month since you puloaded this one
when is your next video?
This video is way too long for the subject matter lol
Watching this on a plane to a fur con at 2:30 AM is a vibe.
The last part was realy awesome
And it was with the release of this video the American-Canadian War began
If you have spotted dick, you should consult a doctor.
canada.... I'm sorry.... but it makes too much sense eh... so prepare for AMERICAN CANADA
But u forgot to talk about Canada
out of all the wars in history out of the MANY war so many the Animanics could make a countries of the world styled song about the many wars in the world he picked the war about a pig and some islands. i mean was it funny... absolutely it was hilarious and to be fair on him who knew about the pig wars before the video was released. and besides i can't wait for the video about the American-Canadian war of 2022 or as it's also known as the syrup war were an angry Canadian general hit little known youtuber who oversimplifies histories of war by smashing a bottle of Canadian syrup on the guys head now theirs a perfect reason to start a war.
General Harney looks like a Sam O' Nella Academy character. 20:17
I guess that we only need the history of the war with Mexico, to complete all the conflicts against the USA in the North American continent. Nice video. :)
Hate how you always try to show the United States in the worst light possible. You do a good job in other ways but when you get done, you make NAZI's look like saints. Enough of this Woke garbage pile on. At least we have the right to say what we wan't here still.
its funny how they thinked that the land was for them but actully it was American Indians land lol
Please do vietnam war! :)
I enjoy the reality checks in these summed up in the line "See America? You've always been this way."
Taking in pickets charge …. Yeah idiots
🤣🤣🤣🤣 man that ending
HES BACK!
You should do the Vietnam war of Chinese civil war
4:11 what the heck??
whoa, your videos are getting better and better!
Biden's coming baby. Probably the most disarming statement you could possibly say. Not because it is a good diplomatic statement, but because whoever may hear that would find themselves swashed in waves of relief.
Does this guy hate the US or something..... yall act like the US is the only country to wipe out a race of people .... pretty much EVERY OTHER country or kingdoms ext tried it before .. from Russia all the way around back to Russia stop making it political..
Talk about more recent wars like Iraq maybe
This is some of your best work
Whenever you make a mistake and you feel bad about ,just rewatch this video ,you are not an idiot no matter what the duck says.
please do Israeli warrrrrrrr
Please come live. Big fan
Can the next video be about the ottoman empire or the holy roman empire
LOve These>
My parents once told me , that before the age of Islam , some arab tribes once had a 40 years long war over a FUCKING COW (female camel) called the "Basus war" in arabic. So...so far that's the dumbest war i heard about...  What's YOUR pick for the dumbest war ever made?
Vietnam War
His videos are so good that he needs to make a team and release a video every month than every 3 months
wait why not do remake your ww1 vids
HAHAHAHAHAHA ALL STAR
Why were people fighting pigs?
>;) this is such a good video thnx for the content also WATCH YOUR BACK CANADIANS THE USA IS COMING IN AND they're COMING IN HOT HOT LIKE FIRE
War in crimea
You want us to invade Canada? Nuts!
mans is running out of wars he’s gonna have to make his own soon
Unrelentingly negative outlook on life? Sounds about right.
Do Alexander the Great
Thanks For uploading youre Videos make learning history actually fun rather than making me feel to end myself out of boredom
37:00 this is easily the best part of the video hands down.👐🏽 32:05 Also, the General is a beast!
Make some video about Southern Asia...much love from india
Bruh se will also speak french
Please moreee
Russian Revolution ???
When OverSimplified doesn’t post in 12 months, you know the video he’s about to drop will his greatest yet
Think video is already a Meme
Do the life of Thomas Jefferson next and Ik you won’t but don’t forget sally Hemings
OverSIMPlified
I think they should make Oversimplified Mario, he's just so cool.
12:06  that’s like ur mum
13:28 Baaaaaa !!!! Baaaa!!! (MORE EXCESSIVE SHEEP NOISES IN THE BACKGROUND) also we need more videos such as :war of 1812, indian history, spanish american war, vietnam, roman empire, ptolemaic egypt, etc...  but again im probably sure oversimplified will be like :" i cant my gout is acting up" like how he said in the funny henry viii one
Can you do Indian revolution,pls
Pov when ur from the future : today well leaen on why this video caused ww3
Its now time to include different genre of wars.... Such as the great war of PewDiePie and P-series
The Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. Didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon when they outnumbered the brits more than 6-1
7:57
Yee haw scenes 8:49 and 36:03
I suggest a Chinese Civil War video!!
10:26: SHUT UP!
Do the Bosnian war 1992-1995 oversimplified
war between two pigs
funny how even the white imperialist powers had fight between them
38:05 sounds great.
7:57 All Star reference 😂
Because of a pig
8:49

7:15 ayo douglas a bit sus
Could you do a oversimplified on admiral Nelson
What about "Vietnam war"
That ending....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
FINALLLYLYYYYYYYYY
Then you my friend, should use nord vpn!  What the f-  I feel like that would be a very realistic reaction
31:00 the voice of the pig sounds like a Charlie Hopkinson  impression of Morgan Freeman
Didnt know my state was involved with all star, war, and pigs
America will never invade Canada. Because that would mean taking Quebec. Even the French think they're a bunch of hockey playing hippies.
Oversimplified, you give us so many memes despite focusing on history
"And which one of us spoke to god?" Was expecting a "Wasn't it you?"
Finally, after 6 month which is a half of the year 😂😂😂
So ur telling me , a full scale war could've happened between two highly developed countries on ..a ...pig.............       Yup , good old Muric'a
I have pigs, controlling them with a wooden fence would be hard lol
He should do a video on the bone wars 😂
18:31
We want the Texas Independence video
29:15 Ahahahawhaha 33:25;Is he gone? 34:13 Go Picket
Well now you have to do the Hatfield's and McCoy's, dammit
Can you do Yugoslavia oversimplified
Spoiler:     America got the islands because of course it did, and you can find Bill Gates and Tom Skerrit reside there. If you don’t know who Tom skerrit is, he was in the original Alien film, so he’s super old.
But what happened to Mr and Mrs Beaver?
Love the pig design looks like wattles from gravity falls
oversimplified coming back after a while of not posting?  This… *did not enrage us, so we will not punish him severely.*  however, we might have to *smashy smash* like Carrie if you take long to post again 😇   im kidding, I know this takes long, please take your time in making these videos and take care of yourself 💞✨
33:31 Best moment.
I think you should do Gallipoli I would tell my friends and brothers and sisters and they would watch it
As a Canadian myself, Imma say naaaaah to being invaded by the US. Big no thanks kek.
LY-MAN CUT-LER…SHOT THE PIG!
32:45 is the best part
Hey buddy, let’s talk. We’re getting a little concerned about that crazy ambition, so maybe we shouldn’t do that
Those jumping cowboys have me dying every time
I want gif of Americans pistol dance.
Do Texas revolution
7:57
such a great ending
You should do the Persian wars!
But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon When the outnumbered the Brits, more than 6 to 1
17:30
the humor in this is phenomenal
33:31 is best
But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming
29:12-29:20 Now I see why this guy got replaced by Abraham Lincoln.
Undersimplified - two sisters fighting
wait Biden? he cant even climb a flight of stairs
18:45-18:48 “Mother! Mother, where are you?”
7:57
OverSimplified please make more videos plss!
7:57 You're welcome
I want 30 years war plssss
It's usually called "the boar war" which gets confused with "the Boer war", different thing entirely!
I just realized that the customs officer that wanted to eat eyes is the senator that broke his cane in the Civil War video. Idk if this was intentional or not.
Oversimplified i have a video idea 💡 make The Great power era
how did you get the morgan freeman voiceline for the pig?
Yeah as a Canadian we elected a drama teacher not once, not twice but somehow three times. You dont have to invade the drama teacher hates us enough to sell off the country for a nickel
As an American I can say this is an accurate representation
Does anyone know what the name of the march is that plays when the Americans show up next to James Douglas? One example of when it plays is at 16:30
this is an experience to watch when inebriated
Can u please do the Vietnam War
Canadians: you don't talk about Canada!! 🥸😭😭😢🥺😩🥸 Mexicans: *sad*
I legit don't mind his adds. I love it🤣! I love watching it cause the way he gets to it is funny. 🤣. Never skip it
I really am confused about this video
i wich you could make a video about the 30 years war
DO THE PUNIC WARS
37:08, no, not at all, Canada and United Sates Of America have what people call the biggest alliance in the world as they are constantly reliant on each other with things like trade, United States Of America would only get worse, also considering as ww2 may happen all over again but with USA since Canada is in the un along with the entire world so not a good option if you are considering the collapse of USA as the whole world will be against them (ww2 vibes) and Canada will just take USA over in that situation with the help of the world since Canada may not stand a chance alone but what about the world alongside with them? Ever thought about that?
You should be a history teacher
I love picturing Oversimplified sitting in there room just screaming random noises into a mic.
I hope one day you can cover something about Peru   Saludos eres el mejor de todos
He should talk about the Mexican Revolution.  China's 1911 Revolution. The Great Depression. 1848 Springtime of Nations. Spanish Civil War.
The next vid should be the war started because of a dog
3:36 DO NOT look between americas legs
33:20 this is the best
By far best vid yet. KEEP EM COMIN
Please make the Vietnam War, partially because i'm vietnamese haha
everone be like new video finshed video daaaaammmmm it
Bro, do the Texas Revolution already!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you do a John Adams oversimplified
Is there anything more stereotypically British than your monocle falling into your tea?
Please do a Indian revolution
What did Canada do to you
Oversimplified hot garbage
This should be a thing on netflix
3:33 Florida 😳
This is the best ending in Oversimplified history!  lol
Thanks for the  38 minutes see you in 6 months
Kkk I love oversimplified here why not do a video about Julius Caesor and the Roman empire or about Nero or Well  I don't then?
As an American, this video is correct. When I see land, I automatically pull out my AR, start grilling burgers and chugging bud light, and planting American flags while playing eagles screeching in the background
It was pretty cool of that man of average height for the time to sell the US all that land.
Its so cool to see a place that you go to on the regular cause us Minnesotans dont get recognized much but northern Minnestians love to go the the lake of the woods
technoblade!!!1!
I love the end
oversimplified reply on this comment and say baaaaaaaa or I'll eat your eyes
God bless America
This is the Video Future historiens Point to when ASK what was the nationalistisch Frenzy thatvgripee th USA in the year 2022 and caused the Grate northern American war
19:28 it was a berkshire
Man you alive 😱, I thought you were dead.
Hey make a video of war the Paraguay
I can't thank you enough, for all the times you made me laugh, while learning more about history. (Mostly American history). You should get an award 🥳🥳
Can you please make a video about india
33:22 - 33:36 went from 0 to 100 LMAO
BUCHANAN
Ok man I’m only accepting 2 things from you, The Vietnam Civil War OR The Spanish Civil War.
I love America
It's even funnier that the majority of the first Americans who governed the US are British too.
Florida the cock of America
how about indonesia history
The jokes have become a little more dry the last couple videos. I miss the old oversimplified jokes
Hi @OverSimplefied can you do a video about the german revolution pleas
Porky is sooo cute☺️
I first watching this while I was having a mental break down
Canada
Great History Video!
Great history video!
10:23-10:28 ah yes, good old house of commons...  Edit: i had to edit a third time since i get the timestamps wrong
i would love to see a oversimplified video on the yugoslav wars i think it will be an amazing video for all the yugoslav viewers like myself and the yugoslav wars in general are an interesting topic
Hey, could you oversimplify the story of the byzantine empire?
Petition to Oversimplified to do the Vietnam war Next and then China's communist revolution.
Didn't watched the video yet, but I'm gonna guess that the pig war is police vs police
Why is American humour so dry and cringe
India!!!!!!!!
Come on over, IF you want 9 - 11 months of unending winter and snow!!  We would love the strong backing of US of A so China won't dare to bully us when we deal with them.
7:57  Epic
Than covid came and almost kill off half the population , thanks too your no mask no freedom right policy . Oh . It turn omicron now . Good luck.
38:15 in all seriousness, Biden is incompetent enough to start a war with Canada just because he wants more maple syrup on his pancakes and wants to see American Mounties
Plea upload a new video
I think this is like the final episode Oversimplified lol... 😂😂😂
Can you make Philippine - American War?
4:10 That really hurt.
I wonder what would happen if the UN saw the last 3 minutes of this video.
The only thing Biden is coming for is for the sight of little kids
I love how the Brita and Americans got together at 34:01 to 35:14
The you are a idoot i Speech is so funny
3:36 Between Napoleon, Colonial America, and later Hitler, and Mussolini, I'm sensing a theme throughout history of people starting wars or just doing horrible stuff to others not just for power or territory, but because they actually believe it is their God given right or destiny to do so.
US Presidents featured in Oversimplified: George Washington (American Revolution) John Adams (American Revolution) Thomas Jefferson (American Revolution, Pig War) James Madison (American Revolution) James Monroe (American Revolution, Pig War) Andrew Jackson (Pig War) James K Polk (Pig War) James Buchanan (Pig War) Abraham Lincoln (Civil War, Pig War) Ulysses S Grant (Civil War) Woodrow Wilson (WW1) Herbert Hoover (Prohibition) Franklin D Roosevelt (WW2) Harry S Truman (Cold War) Dwight D Eisenhower (WW2, Cold War) John F Kennedy (Cold War) Lyndon B Johnson (Cold War) Richard Nixon (Cold War) Gerald Ford (Cold War) Jimmy Carter (Cold War) Ronald Reagan (Cold War) George H W Bush (Cold War) Donald Trump (Cold War) Joe Biden (Napoleon, Pig War)
Do the Thirty Year's War next
WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING OFF THE INVASION OF CANADA FOR 2 CENTURIES, THE TIME HAS COME, THE MOMENT IS AT HAND!
this video is amazing, and so funny. loved it
you literally make learning so much fun.
W
4:08  Your welcome
Why would we want Canada? It's full of Canadians.
what his history of hitler's child hood is blocked in some countries?!?!?!?! lmao
Damn, I used to go to Sir James Douglas's elementary school, never actually learnt who the bloke was even in the school built with his name. Thank you for this video.
10/10
4:12  Me and the bois going to recess
5:56 I love that scene
This is why I don't stand for the pledge, American greed is presented correctly by oversimplified. very well done
33:29
i cant be the only one who saw an among us in background of the thumbnail
This channel Is way to good to be dieing.
Harney looks like Father Elijah from New Vegas.
33:29 that is the rage of a god
moral of the story: america whined like a baby throughout all of history until they got what they wanted.
Very impressed by the attention to detail. Upon my third rewatch, I noticed that the telescope lens had scratch marks at 11:32
Next time pls make a VietNam war next time!!!
Smooth planting of ads in the video!!  So awesome to see another video!!
merry christmas
This guy makes history so damn fun
Oversimplified tends to drop a mini war video , before dropping a two part series …. Vietnam war??
Suggestion: The Hundred Year War from avatar, or the fire nation wars.
3:33 Yes, expand. Grow.
Just a man and his pig
Tbh the war of 1812 arent really a draw since UK burn the white house
Another time of waiting for Vietnam war video since 2 years ago
me expecting a full-on analysis of the technoblade series against squid kid: -_-
Hey can you do Scottish history
"I'll just fence in three sides and hope all these British farm animals have a moral compass and respect my property rights" 17:23  As someone who keeps farm animals, this hit hard
Was that vulfpeck to close that out? Awesome eh!
The funniest part of this video was the suggestion that Biden's coming for anything other than dementia meds and a change of depends.
What about all of the other islands?
Biden is a Joke! Trump is crazy and competent enough to do so
Imagine starting a war with a superpower because of a pig
The location of Florida at 3:33 made me LOL
11:09 "I'm sure this won't cause anyone *to die!!*"  Actually, it didn't.
Biden invade Canada? The idea is *so* insane it's something a 47th president tRump, DeSantis, Josh Hawley, or Ted Cruz would think of!
Bruh America has so many problems in your country. Canada is the best country in the world and plus if you tried to invade us you’d be kicked out of UN, NATO, G7 and League of Nations and all the other country’s in in nato g7 and l o n would be on our side. Yes you would beat us in a war but before you start a war and more problems FIX YOUR OWN FIRST I don’t hate America I just find the ending a bit strange. It’s just you need us for a lot of resources so basically. We need you as much as you need us
Cover the Vietnam war next daddy
I love the NordVPN ads because every time you show the Hitler video and I still refuse to believe that it is real... and yet here we are
The Americans kept coming and they don’t stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. It didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon as they outnumbered the Brits over 6 to 1.
I like how you can identify sentences whenever a crowd is chattering in his videos
16:28 That OH Nou won everything
Can you do the battle of Thermopylae next or the pelopanesian war
WOAH WOAH WOOOOOAH that ending was energic that it charged up my phone
possible vietnam war oversimplified easteregg at 16:01 on the left side table?
Don't mess with America
Hey OverSimplifed can you post a video about the Iran revolution 1979?
Our teacher let us watch an Oversimplified video in class... no seriously...
This man single handedly help me pass my GCSE history
My grandma made an Oversimplified plush for me since they couldn’t afford the actual one because of the shopping we already did. It’s great
I MA CADEIN!!
The pandemic gets to all of us. Some get new hobbies, others go a little crazy, and then you got OverSimplified starting a war with Canada.
Man I feel bad for those beavers.. 7:48   and here is a dead meme 7:57 all star
USA is evil i dont like USA 🇺🇸👎🏻
Could you make a video explaining the Ireland/Northern Ireland conflict and history?
The most interesting thing about this is us Americans saying YYYYEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHAAAAAAAAWWWWW!!!!
And then Biden trips upstairs and war is postponed due to broken hips
please make a video about rasputin
please add turkish subtitles to your videos
Would you make; the Mexican war with USA, i love you videos that are are fun
My mum is English, my dad is American, family gatherings are good.
maybe at some point you can talk about the world's first war in history or the world's shortest war in history
I think western Canada will eventually become American
fun fact: Berkshire Pig is actually pronounced Barkshire (Bark like the barking of a dog).
Biden goes to Canada, greets the Premier Scott Morrison. rofl
Rewatching oversimplified videos has become a routine now
29:11
Oversimplified please do the Wild West!
Please do History of Israel oversimplified
You should talk about the 100-years war, that WE have won huh, WE won the 100-years-war !
Do the war of 1812 next!!!
Density or Destiny?
Next video: BALKAN WARS 🤔🤔
Finally!
Post more😩
Can u do the hungarian revolution next?
Why invade Canada when it's already under US control? *wink* Canada is just another US state waiting official acknowledgement.
James K. Polk: The man, the legend, the absolute unit.
FINALLY! IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER!
This is the angriest Oversimplified ever
7:58 to 8:05 the Americans keep coming but they they dont stop coming
make a vedio on the war between bangladesh vs pakistan
I love how the thumbnail looks cool because of the Star Wars poster
7:58 7:59 8:00
The Americans
12:58 certainly one of the best part of this video
Manifest destiny is just American leivenstrum change my mind
I'm hoping that one day you will make a Philippine revolution video!
I think this might be the only video where there isn't a serious moment. And I think that goes to show how riduculous this whole conflict was.
If I could like this a thousand times I would. Thanks for making these videos they are awesome!
✨manifesting destiny✨
Has a history buff I really do enjoy your videos and I appreciate all the hard work you put into it... Now in the beginning of your video your clean me that why you people invaded native Indian Land which is you are correct... It's just that it wasn't only white people that were trying to expand and colonize.... Since the beginning of time and during that 🌎.. it was the normal and that a lot of countries that had different race try to expand the country for example you had Genghis Khan who tried to take over the whole Asian continent and you have the Ottoman empire a Muslim empire trying to expand their empire and you also have to Spanish empire I was a little doing it in fact you even said yourself they took over Florida and mostly the centrum countries and you have countries and tribes in Africa try to take over other African countries and tribes..... Even native Americans who had slaves are their own attacked other tribes for land and power.... In fact even before white people came to this land you had tribes of native Indians killing other native tribes for landi and power.. A lot of times they would go to other tribes and pillage their land kill all the men and take the women... And when the white people did arrive they did the exact same thing with nothing more nothing less in fact there were even native tribes that had their own slaves and when the civil war broke out in 1861.. A lot of native Indians thoughts with the Confederates.
This is so inaccurate, it's sad
hey ,even though i like both usa and canada  i dont want them to be one nation >:(
Hey can you make a animation about industrial revolution? I need it for my exam plssssss
"Tbh i don't care what you guys up there do, as long as you don't fuck up with the whole world, you can do wathever you want."                                             -Me, a Brazillian
Can you do a video about gustav vasa?
Well, the USA is right now being invaded by mexicans. So San Juan will become mexican territory.
technoblade be like:
Oversimplified for the ottoman empire
can you make a video about the italian revolution
Hey can you make a full version off the amerikans wont stop coming song?
The Outro sounds better at 2x speed if you would like to change it by any chance
Hi i am a fan of your channel.can you please video of indo - pakistani war of 1971 . I would enjoy it and see it a lot of times .
Kind of interesting to know that in a parallel universe Portland could’ve been a bordertown with Canada
The degree of humor in these latest oversimplified videos is fucking brilliant, I love every second of it!
nice segue into VPN ad
Merry Christmas oversimplified!
28:37
I love your videos it’s so funny!!!! No cap!!! XD
7:57
I just realized oversimplified spoke Japanese during the NordVPN ad
32:30 Gotta appreciate that Billy Madison reference. (I think that's where the scene this is referencing comes from)
Can you make a video of Pablo Escobar? I want to know the history of the drug lord!
11:45 Stewie on Family Guy: I'm being sent to dominate the world like my ancestor.  Charles Griffin who was sent to conquer some islands.
37:11 Well Canada, prepare to say goodbye to your affordable healthcare and have your cities be reduced to shitholes filled to the brim with gun toting criminals and homeless camps.
I love the call backs on his history 6:28
Spaghetti Joe 36:12
Call Diefenbaker from his grave its arrow reboot time
ooga booga
The end of this video.... Omg... Please make a full short video about biden's invasion of Canada to obtain maple syrup and drake.
You should review the Toledo war
"But, being an American he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife" I died at this lol
wow. you can really taste the woke on this one
could you make a video on the Vietnam war?
Peter griffin: we’re great swine hearders like our great great great grandfather Charles griffin! Charles griffin: 12:20
I feel like oversimplified could get another 2 videos out of the Punic wars?
I will support biden if he invaded and conquered canada
my  favorite scenes are at 7:57 - 8:06, 28:38 - 29:20, and 33:21 - 33:34. It gets me every time lmao
The Star Wars inspired thumbnail was an excellent idea, and just looking at it makes me laugh. I hope to see more thumbnails like that in future!
I always wonder what your neighbours must think ur job is when they hear this all day
10:20 Order!
This Guy is an actor
7:57 epictos all startos Momentos 🗿😱😱
Lol, OverSimplified went a little extra crazy on this one, eh?
Mole mope mole mole mole mole mole!
Do the chinese civil war
so doesnt that mean that harney has ADHD?
I will sleep with one eye open it's Christmas eve baby Santa's coming to town oh yeah to much sorry to much
Funny ending
If this wasn't so funny I'd report this video for encouraging violence against Canada, lol.
Bruh you just sang all star
33:25 this is absolutely *hilarious*
To be sincerely speaking in my humble opinion without being sentimental and of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my opinion but rather looking into this serious matter with perspective distinction and without condemning anyone's point of view, i honestly think and believe that i have nothing to say. Thank you.....
2:55 Oversimplified Vietnam episode confirmed. what a legend
still waiting for vietnam war.
I didn't think I would get through a 40 minute video like this, but this channel makes it easier I love it
How about the Vietnam war?
do more video's on Canada
The ending was the only time I’ve heard him legit like yell and stuff lol
To anyone triggered by the ending....get over yourself, its a fricking joke cupcakes.
Being from Canada this started life long paranoia I mean have you seen fire-Biden? He's scary  ***Disclamour***: JOKE
Can u do Yugoslavian war next?
Probably the middle channel is the best
7:58
probably the funniest episode of the channel
You should do a video on the Balkin wars
I think this is my favorite video on the channel
3:38 lol ,density
god: dont eat that potato bcus ur gonna start a war pig: *eats potato* god: COME HERE U LITTLE!!
If it was the middle channel the the left of the islands can be British, and the right of the islands can be American, problem solved.
Are u a hockey fan
33:25
We need more videos on absurd avoided wars and also unavoided
I laughed way too hard when Harney got the crap kicked out of him.
I like how the sheriff  has the word booblezz on his calculator
Techno blade would love this 😀
What in the woke nonsense is this
America won't invade Canada. Canada never did anything wrong to the US. We also trade lots with each other, and a war would tear that apart.
7:57 (oversimplified sings all star)
With all that emotion in the end, it should be 'Glorious President Oversimplified' not Drake lol
An important lesson of history. Most of the people we thank of as evil are actually just stupid. Very stupid. Like seriously what was with the general selection during this time period. In the civil war Grant, Lee and Jackson fell like the only competent generals everyone else seem to be selected because they were the first ones to rise there hand when someone asked who wants to be a general.
37:45 *confused Egyptian noises*
My takeaway is that the only thing holding us back from invading Canada is whatever amount of human decency exists inside those in power.
19:32 makes me laugh every time
i am scared
I am one of frist 1'000 that sub
Make a Spanish Inquisition vid
the usa is the scourge of the world and more than likely will bring it to an end
Imagine almost starting a war over a pig.
Im from Indonesia
dramatic reenactment of a pig eating a potato here deserves an award for best animated short...
I didn't even know these little islands existed...
Happy Holidays to all oversimplified fans and to the one and only content creator itself.
CAN YOU DO A RISE&FALL OF OTTOMEN EMPIRE
12:34 The Customs collector and the sheep arguing kills me!
Things escalated so much at end And nobody expected that
Oversimplified has a plushie: wow im so excited for it!  It looks like a dream plushie: bruh
Hey oversimplified can you make a history of Indonesia
Canadians: *"Speak about Canada!!!"* Oversimplified ( some time later ): *"BUT THERE IS NO CANADA AFTER I SPOKE!!!"*
Bro I love this man when he post it’s a good day
Which animation software do you use?
33:29 this made me laugh
7:57 sick beat
This video feels...different, but I love it. Great as allways, improving with every video, trying new things and this glorious ending. Keep up your amazing work.
Glad he is not gone
This would make a great comedy film.
I'm gonna get nightmares for the years to come because of that pig in a tuxedo.
Please do the veitnam war
1:20 so curious, was that just a fat joke, or was it also a joke on his womanizing? :-p
Ever heard of the War of Jenkins' Ear? It lasted for nine years in the mid-eighteenth century between Britain and Spain and was supposedly started because the Spanish coastguard cut off the 'ear' of a captain of a British merchant ship while searching it for contraband in the Caribbean. To prove it, Captain Jenkins produced his pickled 'ear' in the British parliament. I use inverted commas around the word ear because the story goes that the Spanish did not cut off Captain Jenkins ear at all, but a rather more intimate part of his body, which may well be the case, because he wouldn't need to pickle his ear to prove he didn't have it. However if, for instance, the part/s that had been sliced off would normally be found in Captain Jenkins underwear, keeping it/them in a pickle jar would undoubtedly be marginally more acceptable for  proof and display purposes than the only alternative, don't you think?... and describing it/them as an 'ear' might also be marginally more acceptable at the time, although I have to admit that personally I would love it if it had actually been called  The War of Jenkins' Bollocks.
33:35 poor Harney he had to deal with all that weight
The last one make me unsubscribe to u
It's actually pronounced BARK-sher. I know, the spelling is misleading.
you are my favourite youtuber and nothing change that or your sense of humour. Darn tootin!
Do rome
7:57 oh yeah 😎
Canada is the only ally America has got (if you know what I mean)
Do one on Singapore
Can you do you on the Vietnam War? plzzzz
I imagine General Scott taking $100 out of his own wallet and telling everyone to stop being idiots.
Curtain 28:56
The most disturbing thing about the pig in Lyman’s story is not that he’s wearing clothes, but that he has legs in an Oversimplified video.
I want the us to be taken over by Canada
My favorite part of this history is the comparison between Anglo-American (and Canadian) relationships back then and now. The fact that we’re the best of friends now makes me so happy.
Starting a war over a tiny island? Sounds British. I don’t blame their anger, but like come on. It sounds so British.
7:25 anyone know what song is this?
You could make fun of Lyman for only having three sides of a fence, but the Brit  didn’t have any fences. Anyways what J really find interesting in this is is that I kinda agree with both sides.
Can you do the war in 1864 danish Vs Germans
2:39 As an American living in Canada, I got teased a lot for the war. I couldn’t accept the fact that the Americans lost to Canadians outside of the hockey rink (I love Canada, don’t get me wrong), so I did some research. The war is taught differently in schools in Canada, America, and Britain. Canada teaches that they won the war. America teaches that they won the war. Britain teaches that it was a part of the Napoleonic War, and thus they won it. All are wrong, and yet right. Canadians did achieve their primary goal: survive. But they didn’t win in a 1v1; Britain viewed the war at the time as a way to prevent Americans from getting cozy with Napoleon (the USA wasn’t yet a superpower, but the potential was visible even then); and though the US didn’t conquer Canada, they did achieve their primary goal: make Britain stop harassing their overseas trade routes.
I swear if teachers used this guys videos for history kids would be more educated on the history
7:57 overSMASHMOUTH
can you do a video about the mexican revolution?
This very small minded
Do the Peloponnesian wars or the Greco-persian wars
33:29 that escalated so quickly 🤣🤣🤣
Can you do like Star Wars or something
Americans are nothing more than Brits with Guns!  Both of them share the same colonial mindset. This is justified in their own eyes.  Think about this - Brits settled in Continental America. And layed their claims. Eventually got into wars because some of them couldn't agree with one another over issues of exploitation. Bam! USA is created. And rest is colonial dance of dark history!
You should do Martin Luther and the 95 Thesis
I love your jokes
I forgot about my favorite youtuber
I nearly spit out my drink at the Allstar song
Hey oversimplified pls do when Mary 1 pls can you do that pls I wanted to see a history of it
Lmao the last speech has me proud to be an American ❤️🇺🇸 All love to my Canadian neighbors though, peace and love! 🇨🇦
The end killed me
The end of this video is literally goals for the future.
Like for a Roman Republic video.
You would think that the last 2 minutes would sacrifice his Canadian audience, but I'm always with you OverSimplified!!! (I'm Canadian)
That ending was top tier
3:54 "I hear voices all the time"
OverSimplified and Internet Historians are my FAVORITE HISTORIANS in YOUTUBE!!!!
Some time in the 1980s my dad  went to the Soviet Union and bought one of those doll things it was illegal because the government did not sell it or something we still have it
bruh that vod isn't blocked in the us
thechnoblade had a war
Can you do a video on the Vietnam war?
Everybody gangsta still the pig stands up and starts walking
what the thumbnail supposed to look like star wars, like palpatine hood in the back and red and blue lightsaber
I fucking love this channel.
i totally agree with this disparaging video. so can we please give this area back to the british or the canadians or anyone else who will take all the antifa lovin inhabitants that live there now. and please take the video maker with you.
ending wass amazing
Remember it's all the UK's fault we're all here today.
This might have to be the best video you’ve ever made , cheers for the laughs
Someone inCanada needs to do an answer video to that ending
Try doing the Philippines
I laughed so hard 33:29
We're taking Alaska btw
Canadians burned down the White House damn it!
if only history subject is this jazzy, college life wont such be a boring episode after all,,, more videos like this pleaseeeee!!!!
Bidens coming baby I’m just gonna randomly slip this onto conversation
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE  TELL ME THE SONG THAT PLAYS WHEN HARNEY GOS INTO SCHEME MODE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Lol I love how the pig is just a different colored waddles lol
Yea your already re-watching this don’t lie
would love if you did a video on the troubles, as im irish it'd be interesting to find out more
m
I love 7:31, 11:18, 16:35, 24:40
7:58
joe biden is watching the last 2 minutes thinking to himself why not invade canada
It wasnt a draw. Canada kicked America ass. That's why they don't teach that shit in America.
Baaaaaaa!
after the ad for the @oversimplified plush: You wouldn't get it other history channels, no one would snuggle with you.
Waddles, no!
Just don’t invade Canada in the winter
Hey. Canada won the war of 1812. And we'll kick your ass again lol
Save our bacon was the highlight
Harm my pet pig and I will ventilate you
I feel bad for the Spanish. They had to watch us Americans fight,get drunk and murder each other for centuries
All the other videos are amazing. This one sucked.
6 months of military training couldn't have prepared me for that ending
If this was the plot of the movie, I'd criticize it for being too absurd.
I am getting that plush. sad it takes so long tho
You should do a video on the War of Roses
7:57 is this why?
Keeps improving every time
Americans always say the wr of 1812 was a draw this is obviously bullshit as the americans tried to invade and failed the Brits lost nothing the only failier was american includeing  the crappy white house .........yet more american history bullshit .......
this dude's transitions to the sponsorship are smoother than a baby skin....
What an ending!
He needs to upload more
35:55
The issue of the northwest border is solved and it will never come up again
Vietnam war next?
COULD YOU PLEASE DO WAR OF THE ROSES?! I found that exceptionally confusing and would love an Oversimplified version!
Make video about Yugoslavia
Дайте перевод на русский язык пожалуйста
5:00 You can see a map of the Vietnam war. It could be his next video
Another wonderful work, Morgan Freeman's impression was giga xD
Nord vpn comes on +10 +10 +10
id love to see the english civil war next
we had the emu war , now the pig war
8:06 if you count up the ones not holding flags, there are 3 British settlers and 18 American settlers. 18 to 3 is 6 to 1, so that was cool
36:57 I thought this was gonna be another total war ad
12:50
I want to see him do crusades, doesn’t have to do all of them, maybe just the 1st and 3rd, and like 1 minute to make fun of how bad they did during the 2nd.
Can you make an Oversimplified BTS video it would be awesome🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I enjoyed this one the most out of all of them, good job.
Lovely video as always 😂 Recommendations for new ones: War of the roses The crusades South american wars of independence
Is Mr. Eat your eyes real
When’s nam
while he is usually my favorite but I was expecting something much cooler after waiting so long but hey lets hope that the next video is (put in comments)
fun fact : the owner of the Oakley Sunglasses company owns an island in the San Juan archipelago
I do not want to believe this came out 2 weeks ago
Best.  Ending.  Ever.
I am from the CIS and Cis translators voice with soul and emotion and watch the translation much more fun :D
So another pig has to die???
BUCHANON!
Straight line
Love your videos Oversimplified! Maybe the next one could be about the golden age of piracy? 🙏🏻
I love how Captain Hunt was like Meh while Scott is beating up Harney
Next video should be the 7 years war or the great depression. Also, how do you make your videos?
What is the name of march song in 16:29?
The ending
make one with veitnam!!!!
Harney: puts Pickett back on the island  This enraged Winfield Scott who punished him severely
Please do a video on Battle of Midway
You may think invading Canada is easy, but you have no clue what we have in store.  Prepare for the worst invasion of Beavers you've ever seen.
7:57 🤛🏻👄
I read the thumbnail as Pog war
Honestly I would react the same way if someone were to rip their own skin at 5:53
I would love this guy as my history teacher :)
the next video should be about the 30 years war or the hundred year war or the northern wars
no hes not
Do the war of the roses
And what USA really wanted from British after the Civil War was Canada.
foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
i aint the sharpest tool in the shed
War of the bucket- not really started by a bucket, but was a war. The pig war- not really a war, but was started by a pig.
Americans: Howdy neighbor. We're Americans, and we want to be your friends. James Douglas: NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
7:57 oh ho... I see what you did there
37:20 to 38:23 was the most popular
That’s so good
“The Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming jumped in the wagon as and they hut the ground running. When they outnumber the Brits 6-1 Million

World War II or the Second World War, often  abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries-including all of the great powers-forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
I love the rivalry between us and the yanks, adds some fun to life lmao
Pickett’s character development is amazing, can’t wait for his arc to be adapted in the next season
Love this
Let's be honest, the only place biden is coming is where most of his voters reside. Graveyard that is. In case he can pass a few stairs on entrance, of course
7:54 you came here
Now talk about the Canada/Denmark Whisky war
The war about your mom
7:56 thank me later
Please do Irish war of independence oversimplified
all star song
I would love to see one on the space race
Suffering from a bit of white guilt there, Oversimplified?
Plz make indian revolution
they think Canada is forgotten, think about new Zealand people think we are part of Australia
Cool to see a video take place near where I live
anti-America garbage
Now the Biden thing was a little overdid
ccccan u do anne frank??? oversimplified-sempai >^<
18:38, This is historically inaccurate, DB Shotgun was invented in 1875 and the pig war happened in 1859 but still. Funny animation and out of context moment, this is Oversimplified
CEASER NEXT!
BYZANTINE SASSANID WARS NEXT!
PUNIC WARS NEXT!
THE 5 GREAT EMPERORS NEXT!
ALEXANDER THE GREAT NEXT!!!!!
AURELIAN NEXT!!!!!!!!!!
JUSTINIAN THE GREAT NEXT!
So glad I watch this on my TV when it premiered.
Song at 7:26 and 16:28
I have a question, do the americans keep coming?
good morning kitten is a actual page and its the best thing ever
LOL
And so it was
Fjb!!
I love how Americans is described as
That just creepy at the end
no
0:55 no joke that pig looks like darth vader
Need to rethink the channels name, this story was anything but oversimplified.
greco-persian wars please🙏
The ending is the closest we’ve heard to his real voice
3:37 density lmao
But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming
The music at 7:25 and 16:28 is the National Emblem March
I do apologize aboot what I'm about to say... eh... but keep dreaming, you damn yank. Canada is the TRUE North, Strong, and Free! You're getting nothing, not one Timbit! NOT. ONE. TIMBIT! /Joke
The entire video I was wondering if Pickett was the same pickett from picketts charge
Canadians are so not going to be happy when they see the ending.
It's USA's manifest destiny to take Canada, it's my manifest destiny to ask Oversimplified to oversimplify it for us when it happens
At least they didn't have nukes...
29:18. I don't think I can get enough of this scene.
Your mom
10:20 the British Parliament scene kills me every damn time
If Canada is ever succesfully invaded by the US, I'm moving to Antarctica.
Legend Has It That 1 Person In Every NordVPN Ad Will Be Given The Legendary NordVPN Hair
didnt know he hated canada so much
This man is a god of history worshipped by the stupid....I bow down to you my history God. 👏
It is our density not destiny to invade the American continent
33:29
Just finished the video. As a canadian: try it yank.
You should make a video on the Vietnam War like teased back in your Cold War video. I’ll help invade Canada if you agree.
Do the Spanish civil war and the effects on Gibraltar please tag me if the vid is made
What the f
People from Washington had to learn this in Washington state history in Middle school
i am mad
Cool fact, the europeans got the idea of making beaver hats from mongolians
Lol
-Vancouver Island- *Victory Island, USA*
Do the Spanish Civil War
Hmmmm I wonder where this is banned 6:36.
Canada, join us and together, we could RULE THE GALAXY AS FA- i mean RULE THE WORLD
You should do a video on the Texas revolution . I doubt you'll see this tho . Also merry xmas
Why didn’t he draw Captain Pickett during Pickett’s charge in the American Civil War? (Both in that video and this video)
33:21 Scott didn’t leave. He was listening behind the door.
Still not enough about Canada
12:33-13:30 is so fucking funny I can't even
28:38 No that was Pickett
14:28  2318008 upside in digital font spells "boobies".
Thinking it all that begun with a father-son bad relationship
19:05 I love how Griffin’s eyes become more and more circular as Oversimplified zooms in.
7:55 he can sing allstar? put the beat over it.
I’d worry less about invasion of Canada and more about your defeat in Afghanistan
7:57
So funny
You can have Drake. In fact, PLEASE take him!
This is the longest I've waited to watch in forever but idk what I was waiting for
Ever get that sinking feeling that local and global politics hasn't been going down the shitter but rather had always been shit?
holy cow that was some good history
pls tell me he actually got morgan freeman to voice a pig
What if people had computers n internet n monitors n everything in like the stone age
The ending was just perfect, I dropped one tear
One of my favorite videos from OverSimplified (I also like the ones on the American Revolution, Civil War, Prohibition, Napoleonic Wars, French Revolution, World War I and II, and the Cold War, as well as the Emu War and the War of the Bucket).
🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
You finally posted
C’mon man, President Spuds for brains Brandon couldn’t invade the geriatric isle of a Walgreens, neither could he successfully withdraw. I do however like the idea of making Canada the 51st state. In the future should we have a President that at least knows where he is 90% of the time this could be a reality.  Fun fact: Canada has a “strategic maple syrup reserve” and the value of Canadian real maple syrup is set on the Canadian market by Syrup speculators. So while the world worries about oil drilling Canada worries about there being enough spiles to drown the country’s pancakes.
Hallo
spuddy was also a casualty
You know what would be another epic video? “The Troubles - Oversimplified”  Think about it. Ireland’s aspiration for independence and Home Rule, the Easter Rising, the partition between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, the Irish Civil War, Sinn Fein, Bloody Sunday, attacks and bombings committed by the IRA (Real and Provisional) and the UVA that all ended with the Good Friday Agreement.
Biden would be like we are invading Mexico? And then shit his pants………. Now if tulsi gabbard was President would have the USA 🇺🇸 flag waving all over Canada in 72 hours!!!! That women is our Iron Lady! MERICA🦅🇺🇸💪👍
Can we get an apartheid one next
Aye why Rusia sell Alaska to USA during Alaska purchase during 1867
This ending is one of the reasons I love to watch his videos and not for my history homework but for pure enjoyment!
7:56 why does it sounds like all stars song
37:05 pog
You should do something with rome
33:28 is one of my favourite oversimplified moments.
The animations and edits this guy does are fantastic, make me laugh every time
13:55 THIS IS THE MOST UNDERRATED JOKE IN THIS WHOLE VIDEO
Lol Biden cant even dress himself or put together 4 words that make sense.  Im not so worried about being Invaded. lol
Good thing pig physics weren't a thing yet.
1:22 that made me laugh so much
we’ll burn that white house down again
It interesting how the animations have improved over time.
Did anyone get the Waddles reference 🙂
Emu War, Pig War... Is there any more wars with animals?
European Borders: OuR anCestOrs usEd To LiVE hErE   North American Borders: 49th parallel? 49th parallel.
our country(Canada) is practicly impossible to invade and plus we go many great soilder and if usa ever did invade canada they would piss off the un and have war with 193 countries... sooooooooooooooo uhm u still wanna invade
Can you do ancient Eygpt next time
The all stars referece idk how you type that i have dyslexia
16:20 🤣🤣🤣
that last part was pretty rude to canada
I would choose this guy as my history teacher than anyone else.
do the yugoslav wars
Should I be scared now?
"and who was it who spoke to god?" "I thought it was Sharon's cat" "I hear voices all the time"
i learn more history from this channel than actual school. and im not joking..
My main take away. Immigration is, in practice, the same thing as invasion.
And yeah dont forget to subscribe to Nord vpn
MURICAAAAAA!!!!
Shit I read the video as the big war and was waiting a lot of war to happen till I read it again and it was pig🤧
I wating so long viet nam war,can we have that?
I only disliked this video because of the ending
I know who I’m voting for 2024
As someone who lives on orcas island in the Puget sound I have been told much about it
EVERYONE HE SINGS ALLSTAR AT 7:58
I thought you retired
Biden's superpower is tripping on stairs 3 times
Can you do Chinese Civil War?
Please can you do the Irish war of independence 👍🤩
Bro surprised me with the ending. Stop trying to start your own war just cuz you running out of things to talk about. lmao. At least us brits aren't involved (hold up, canada's the commonwealth)..SCRAP THAT. COMMONWEALTH VS USA.
I have learned more from this man that then I have ever learned in school. He's like that teacher that makes everything fun. He knows how to grab everyone's attention and keep everyone focused. When I was in school I Bailey paid any attention because my teacher didn't care about a job and stuff, she made nothing fun so nobody really cared about history. But this man has taught me so much LOL
13:28  BAAAAAAAAA BAAAAAAAAA The assistent: ಠ︵ಠ
7:55 - 8:07  All Star
You need to make more
i am interested on how you find these subjects where do you take inspiration from?
Human incompetence is hilarious to watch from afar 😂. Glad this was sorted out a long time ago!
American : gets the island Also American : threatening to invade nonetheless
cover the crusades that would be cool
"But the americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running."  I died
I think you should make a Sepoy mutiny video or something related to India
19:12 probably the cutest scene in all of oversimplified’s videos.
10:23 "Order!" "Ordeerrrr!" "SHUT UP!"
who spoke to god? sharon's cat
Every single video Oversimplified has been uploading lately (well, lately, the last year or two lmao) is a total masterpiece. I absolutely love this channel, keep it up!!
Literally the only war in which America was occupied by a foreign power controlled by the British or not Canada held American territory and burnt the White House....
What's the song used when the Americans encroach on Douglas lands?
I am wholeheartedly behind the Biden Administration's invasion of Canada, henceforth known as, "Maple-Freedom-Land."
Well that escalated quickly....
100, 80, 30 or 7 years war next please :)
I love your videos!!! Me and my dad always watch them together! They are so cool! Could you do a video on the Yugoslavia Wars? I don’t know much about them and thought it might be interesting. Thank you for your content!
7:56 Shrek song of Kingdom
Can you please make a video of Spanish Civil War?
please do the 30 years war or the entire reformation.
vietnam war
How many drugs towards the end?
The end was so funny!!! lol
I hate history subject, and yet this guy make me like it
Can you do a video with Portugal like the ottoman portugese war or the portugese Dutch wars?
I just watch your first video again and it has really big Difference between new Video!
I wonder why the Hitler video is censored in France? Not even Germany here.
0:49 Spoiler alert! There were white people.
The end perfect
A 38  minutes video is not really oversimplified
vietnam war please
the nord vpn transition was smooth.
GUYS WHAT IF HE DID THE SPACE RACE: OVERSIMPLIFIED!!! I WOULD WATCH THE SHIT OUT OF THAT!!!
37:08  Canadians who watched this video: 👁👄👁
7:57 oh my god
7:58 thank me later
Comments for algorithms text
You know what they say about native people if they ain't white they're a blight.
BUCHANAN!
If we'd gotten into a shooting war with the Brits, the Canucks probably would have invaded, marched to DC, and burned the White House down. Again. Because: Fun fact! The only country to ever successfully invade the United States mainland... is Canada
Americans won't survive a week in the north Canadian winter
And there alias
I swear to God if you can amirican s set foot in Canada. And also were called a free country for a reason
You have 5 million subs and you upload once in 6 months :/
3:33 Penis Florida
It's all enjoy and fun till american settler killed the Pig.
Joe sucks oof.
I really love your videos, I could watch them for hours.  Also... we should take over Canada, that would be the best thing to ever happen to this nation.
38:20 -- _Smash cut to General Scott:_ "HARNEY!! Have you listened to a SINGLE word I've said!?" Harney: "YES! Yeah. Joint military, island, no Pickett. Got it."
I almost read it as OverSimPified
27:47 is that speedwagon?
Just thought about it, where's Vietnam oversimplified
OverSimplified: *threatening Canada* australia: *closes ports*
Dear America,  Get screwed  Sincerely Britain, GREAT Britain  Lol in all seriousness loved the bit about Britain taking the flag pole 🤣🤣
33:26 OMG SO FUNNY
07:55 absolute music
Oversimplified, 20 years+ : “And that is how one simple YouTube video started the Great US-Canada war…”
In Oversimplified's Channel we had two slogans "You never saw it coming" "The definition of quality over quantity"
WHERE IS THE dude uncool
This story is wired
3:32 is it just me who saw that thingy?
Hey, I’m Nicki Minaj’s cousin’s friend
7:55 - All Star reference
vietnam war next plz
I mean, China could take over the USA if they wanted. China’s population is 1 billion.
general harny  horny
And this is why we need communism. So that people can’t argue who’s land it is.
I can't tell if he loves or hates Canada.
I think Oversimplified has finally lost it-
Why does the ending feel like the video Oversimplified has been wanting to make their whole life? 🤣
Best end ever
War,war never changes
If this is good just saw it today
My fellow Canadians! Prepare for our defence against the scourge of a vengeful Biden!
Ahh oversimplifeid what a beautiful majestic place….to learn about war blood and violence!
Every episode the budget goes up and every time the jokes get funnier.  Sheep bit
Please make a video on indo pak 1971 war
In the end, this went in a different direction than I initially expected.
7:58 you should sing all star but the lyrics are about the pig war.
Little late to ask but Vietnam-war Oversimplified When?
biden comin baby!
13:28 Broke me instantly. Same with 33:29
The unpleasant comments from Canadians enraged OverSimplified that he punished them severely.
I’ve been to those islands, well, only San Juan. Beautiful place.
Probably the best video so far, I’ve never laughed so hard after a history lesson
You should do a video about the Greeks or Romans.
11:57 porky is telaported from the pig realm to see what these glubby humans are up to fighting over some islands in between the United States and Canada  Porky then finds out what they are doing with these islands and dies to go back home
You should do Vietnam war
(Cough) war pigs by black sabbath (cough)
This man made me learn in a fun way,thanks oversimplified
Your outro music is so funky
37:19We shall fight From the Cn tower to Alert from Bonavista to the Vancouver islands we will never surrender long live canada!!
History class at its finest is the definition of this guy
@3:33 ah yes. Florida. America's dick.
HEYY HE MADE A VIDEO ABOUT HIS MOM.
How about a video on the FLQ? Canadians would enjoy a video on their own history and the rest of the world would get educated on something they likely know nothing about.
I have a theory that oversimplified is sam o nella
the ending. YES PLEASE!!!
Oh my god, at 36:10 that spaghetti headed fellow is on the picture, I guess characters can come back randomly!!! I wonder who else will be spotted…?
I would love to see Oversimplified try his hand at the Hatfield & McCoy feud.
Can you please do the Texas Revolution
You haveent posted a vid a while-
Very entertaining and informative video
British: Then you my friend should you use nordvpn! American: ....... WHAT THE F*
Biden cumming with a vengeance 😟
“NordVPN can prevent undesired eyes from viewing your search history”  NordVPN is now powerful enough to stop ur mom
Hey oversimplified is it possible you could cover wars of ancient times such as the punic wars with rome and carthage? Or maybe could yoy cover alexander's conquests? That would be amazing!
7:55
Mexico got nerfed so hard 💀
7:57
7:56-8:04 is literally all star
7:57 all stars remix BOI
Hey my dude plz do a Vietnam War one.
Make about the greeks
It's so  long
Thanks, Smash Mouth

The Americans start coming and they don't start coming. Hopped in there wagons and they hit the ground running
7:58 This man is spittin fire lyrics
We want a plushie!
Do we talk about how he started to sing his own version of All Star
31:02 the pig sounds like Morgan Freeman
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
8:00 sounds like all stars
LMAO DRAKE
9:19 lol
You are one if the best youtubers out there  Why r u taking so long between ur videos man 🙁
12:20
You should make a video calbing with a stocks expert on how Hitler brought Germany out of its phase of rapidly increasing inflation
I still like the videos...but this one it feels like the comedy is a big tangent and overpowering the history.  The jokes are funny until they get in the way of the flow of the narrative.
I just want to drink my maple syrup in peace
Wait.... why did the Germans decide?
By far the best. ending. ever.
Please do a video on the Winter War. I'll give you hamburber if you do. A rather good investment.
Can u make a video a out the Paraguayan War?
This is one of those videos that he ha way to much fun making.
Imagine Biden sees this video and actually tries to take over Canada
7:57 why is it that the lines you say reminds me of Smash Mouth lol
3:36 accurate representation of florida
this video is to funny bro
Oversimplified is becoming radical. Too bad
The Americans keep coming, and they don’t stop coming. Hopped in their wagons and hit they ground running. Didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon, when they outnumbered the brits, almost 6 to 1
7:58 is the rap timestamp I think
And the moral of the story is....don't mess with the US or Americans since we are a bunch of psychopaths who are foaming at the mouth and ready to shoot at anyone at the drop of a hat.
Props to this channel im loving American history even though its beyond my care as i am from the Philippines, the satire, sarcasm is just too funny, this channel is fckng gold lol
I mean 8 mil views in 2 weeks is crazy but even crazier is that over 1/3 of that did subscribe!
7:00 why does the land look like a wide face baby
Now we gotta go with this for the next 3-4 months
Who it this nord guy is like he everywhere
Well now I wanna see a video on Texas and the Mexican American War.
Opersimplified 2021- You Two Are The most MIND-NUMMINGLY BRAIN-DEAD Ding-Dongs Ive Ever Encountered In All My Life , AND ILL SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE
Do the whiskey war next
Lol wtf is this
Lol Canada is occupied by the usa in fallout
I'm a simple man, I see a new Oversimplified, I click it.
Me: "America is the greatest country in the world!"  Canadian: "sorry, but we have affordable medical."  Me: "bu- bu-..BAAAAAAA!!!"  Canadian: "BAAAAAAA!!!"
I can see the annoying Vegans coming from a mile to comment in the comment section
can u plz do ww1 remake (plz)
Awsome storytelling and great animations. I have seldom enjoyed such a good video.
If this man is gone, no one will take his simplifying place, period.
The best Nord VPN ad ever !!
recommendation: could you focus on more African and South American wars because I think they are not talked about enough. keep up the good work.
Urrgggg loved it!!
thank u for making my day oversimplified
Yo april first you should upload oversimplified ww3
1:40 The biritsh respecting existing borders and terrain to judge where it should be. Me: *visible confusion*  1:54 sTrAiGhT linE Me: Yep, seems about right.
7:57 is my jam
Hey OverSimplified! It thought of an event that I think would be cool to make a video on: Caribbean pirates. Like Blackbeard, Benjamin Hornigold, and Charles Vane vs. the British soldiers. I am obsessed with pirates and their history so I would really appreciate it if you made a video o; it! Thanks!
It was the harrow straight
28:54 I can't watch this szene over and over and over and over again. One of the best ever made on this channel!
Please do the war of 1812
I love how Oversimplified always uses his Hitler videos as an example for blocked content in his Nordvpn videos
I love to learn all about these things when I'm only in 5th grade
Do Joan of Arc
What an outro 👏
7:57, Oversimplified is currently rapping during History lol
I love the smash mouth bit. It took me a couple of view to find where I heard that lyric Jajaja .😎
Can you do a video about the industrial revolution?
When he sang all star it was fire

Can you make a video about the german-french war 1870-1871
Do a video on the Cuban revolution👀.
7:57 OverSimplified is good at singing All Star.
This was the funnyest video ever
7:56 Nobody is pointing out this part?  ‘And the Americans start coming and they don’t stop coming, Hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running, Didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon, When they outnumbered the Brits more than six-to-one.’  Sound like something familiar?
I copied your profile picture
For people trying to find him singing all star, here it is 7:57
Sike
Oversimplefie win so many subscribers the last time I see was went I subscribe he just hava 100k of subscribers
This may be the best oversimplified video ever made just because of that outro.
7:57 All stars moment
Remember kids: keep a level head
Shit that fucking ending was hysterical as hell.   For anyone getting their tighties bunched up below.  IT IS A JOKE. Oversimplified does that. Duh
You. Make more rifles! You. Build new cannons! *You.* MAKE MORE VIDEOS IM FAILING HISTORY
Can you do an Irish history video?
Good video
8:50 made me spit out my milk. Lol
Harney orders Pickett back onto the island. This engraged General Scott, who punished him severely.
As a Canadian, I can say without a doubt that I was more terrified of that ending than the entire nation of America.
This is genuinely the funniest video you’ve ever published.
You should do the warring states period in china
Hey oversimplified can you do a video about India
Bruh you had too much fun with the voice acting. Like im done. WTF was that ending.
Utter Garbage...
16:00 the Americans are using ak-47s???
10:53 you know that is something does soundlike UK parliment would do
33:29
Can you please do something about the Troubles in Ireland, both in the 10's-20's & 70's-80's. That would be dope.
37:16 this is my ideology in a nutshell. Why not?
33:28 simply beautiful.
Vietnam Oversimplified pls? You said you'd do it in the cold war series....
Murica motherflowers!!!!!! Keep an eye on your pigs Canada!!!! Oh shut, I don't even get my greencard yet 😬
You should do Louis XIV of France
I hope they do the Crusades next, been waiting for that for 4 years now
Absolutely brilliant and super funny!
7:57 best
Omg that ending was fucking hilarious
I hate to spoil the fun but I don’t think Biden is competent enough to start a war with Canada and win
7:58
At 3:38, did anyone notice it says density instead of destiny.
petition for oversimplified to do the crusade wars
LOL . the end of the video. I liked the joke  - sincerely,  you're friendly but always will never hesitate to burn anything,  canadian. 😉

Is this Sam O'Nella or Oversimplified got his dealer's number?
Its just funny how more and more people in higher positions arrive to tell others to fuck off
Is there a single Canadian here with the balls to claim a reply on my comment?  **puts hand on gun**
The Columbia River should be the border.
That ending though.. lol
No one: Absolutely No one: Not even Harney: Oversimplified: 🇺🇸🤜🇨🇦
Your browser history is interesting...
25:35 looooooooool
Can you do the East Timor Invasion and Genocide or the Rwandan Genocide
Can you do one on Julius Caesar? My brother is reading the book now
"Equators Gonna Equate" 15:41 Genius.
When you think Oversimplified is out of videos, he keeps coming with videos about wars that I haven't heard of. Also the ending was awesome!
Can you do about ottoman empire
roman history next?
Seeing Point Roberts kinda wanted me to see you make a video on it, but at the same time is it really worth it?
Plot twist: Canada win the war
Hey Oversimplified, Can you do the philippine-american war next?
Wait the Panama canal did not exist back then.
Do American and Mexican war plz
Unsubscribed because of the social justice nonsense. YouTube will moderate my moments and reject them. Losers.
I hoped this site would avoid the SJW angle. I guess not.

This is the most American thing I've seen in a while
I would love to see “Yugoslavia - Oversimplified” one day. With Tito, Milosevic, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, it’ll be epic!
Four revolvers and a giant knife most American thing I’ve ever heard
Such an anti-American tone to this whole video. Even though it's American history, Democrats will still love it.
TALK ABOUT EGYPT
33:10
9:18
This truly insults everyone I love it
31:35 - 31:52 Was Sooo Smooth
All of that........over......a.....F*#$ING PIG?! 'murica!
Why do i feel like oversimplified sang all star.. 7:58
Kanye should be president
Spotted what?
Ever thought of oversimplifying AP U.S. History
13:03 Ain't it "parley" and not "parlay" ?                                         I'm sorry but I was just wondering if _you,_ the great OverSimplifed, could have made a vile error of yours, innit m8 ?
Go vegan, meat industry pure evil
And the americans keep comming and they don't stop comming 7:56
33:29 Is my most favorite part in this entire episode I don’t know why I just break down
Im just saying, last war between Canada / US, Canada won ;)
Oversimplified, I'm a big fan from Africa, Ethiopia. Please do the Ethio - Italian war of 1896
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥
Hey Oversimplified, I would love to see a video of the explanation of the Ukrainian Revolution as it too was a key part in modern history, and it is not very known to many, but still a suggestion which explains Ukraine situation right now... And I love your videos so keep up the good work!
Pls make a video a ou the War of 1812
Lmao the ending tho
ok, but after the few days for the PREORDER are over, can we order it regularly?  Sorry, but I heard that at 0:16 and it was all I could think of the whole video -.- you either pulled a genius wordplay to incentivize buying or mixed up a couple of words.... which is it!!!!! :D
Do a video on the indo pakistani war
Lol that ending tho
If WWIII starts oversimplified should do a livestream
I hope you do a video of the Mexican American war
You really outdid yourself with this one again. Amazing and well made video!
That final part makes it seem like Oversimplified will be making a video on the Oversimplified War soon.
Please do Vietnam War
Biden can kiss my ass I like a president who can walk up stairs, who can read something before he signs it, who can have a speech without cards, and can actually benifit the economy. Trump 2024

LOL THAT COMMAND AND CONQUER JOKE
7:57 the best part of the video
Oversimplified if you hear me your wish it’s completed because lots of US players in Rise of nations have invaded canada
I love how in one moment he compares Colonial Americans to Disease and in another he promotes America annexing Canada to get back at Canadian commenters.
5:16 there is a map of vietnam ON THE TABLE, ASSUMTION: NEXT TWO EPISODES ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT VIETNAM!
only an American can ask for vengeance after they have won
how are your vids so good
Hey oversimplified could u please do a video about the mexican-french war.
Better than most of the movies. One of the best thing I watched on YouTube.  Such a great way of explaining history as if I am watching a movie. Great work guys. A must recommended channel 👌
At 8.00 it is like he is singing all star for some reason
7:57 That was on purpose
38:16 oh fuc-
32:01-32:11 gives me Kyle Rittenhouse vibes 😂😂
This was flat-out hilarious. Very informative but yeah....i chortled quite a bit at this video. Chortled I tells ya. I am eagerly awaiting the Oversimplified Vietnam War.
"wow wow wow i dident say they were white people"
That Nord VPN transition was priceless.

Imagine comparing Americans to rats or a disease.
As if Maple Syrup would be the greatest American Food in this scenario... ever heard of Poutine?

I feel like he covered this is in a really old video that he took down a while back
You should do a video for Indian independence struggle it would be really great to see a Gandhi merch🤣🤣
USA population 333,844,797 invading a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations with a population of 2,418,964,000. That's a lot of people to piss off.  I mean Grenada was bad but that would be a whole new level.
NO USA
Bravo I think you have really found your comedic stride. This was your funniest video to date.
Plz make a video of Indian Revolution
7:15
"…" '…' "Straight line?" 'Straight line.'
33:29 *Harney gets beaten up by Winfield Scott for being the most braindead, stupid piece of soggy, rotten chunk of soil and sending Pickett back on the island.*
if you invade us, just let us keep everything we have and that's fine.
Hey, why don't you make a video about the war of French + America against Viet Nam

lets make the world a better place,my style
Aging like a fine wine.  Nicely done.
You should do the war of the roses
I liked you before but I am from Serbia and we are sick of super powers starting wars and threatening to other narions
can you do the as we call it in sweden "Stormakts tiden" 1611- 17:18 When sweden takes over large  amount of Europa
Your saying we should invade Canada ?! screw you i'm unsubscribing this channel
The History of North America can be summed up as Native Americans losing track of what white people wanted to kill them.
OverSimplified is starting to sound like Kyles mom
Funniest video by oversimplified
Am I the only one who think this guys crazy?😕
The pig is waddle's cousin (gravity falls)
I’d love to see you do one on Alexander the Great!
demn
This video is just so great
i now have a dream one day i will become president and i will invade canada
4:21 reminds me of a settler country,  I wonder which one that could be.   Israel?
7:58 Oversimplified spittin' bars
Really, Oversimplified? You're the one who started that war between America and Canada? Through a video? This is even stupider than that war that almost got started over a dead pig!
Please make more videos regularly
Can’t believe you got Morgan freeman to be on this video
Can You make a video of Polish-Bolshewik war 1919 - 1921
Depends if that island has oil or not, america has issues with distinguishing borders and countries when that is nearby.  Likely all the fried food confusing them.
Bro could you make indian independence war plz
This intro had me lmao ;)
Well may I order 1919 revolution in Egypt
Canada soilders during war : Ohh !sorry.
i love you and your videos
I dislike the hatred this video has toward the US. Natives signed contracts and didn’t understand a lot of them. It is both the natives and the USs fault.
Man I hope he will make video about Vietnam war
It's my birthday today and I got ur sweatshirt and t-shirt merch, thank you for the merch and incredible content 👍
If you listen closely, you'll find out that he wants to invade Canada.
You know the funny thing is, I'm sure it's an absolutely miniscule, not really worth considering, amount of actual Canadians, but I have had Canadians tell me that they wished America would annex them
I would love to see you do a video about indonesian history!
It took more than three months for this one, so I got a little scared someone important got sick or something.
3:38 Yep its your *Density* pal America.
If you get to the sponsor section, skip to 6:52 to avoid it
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. It didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon, When they outnumbered the British more than six to one." The best piece of music to ever leave a humans mouth.
10:23 yup that looks like parliament in a nutshell
Nah, Canada has assault moose.  Dear Canada, we just playin'! We don't want the smoke!
7 years war pls
“Pig war” Me: TECHNO
Talk about Alaska next lol
The middle most channel.
Techno blade viewers: hey I’ve already seen this
Canada should join the US. It is already a US puppet state and increasing evidence is showing it may be inevitable.
Just like what god planned
May you do over simplified apartheid
Straight line?
7:57
I’m liking just for the ending 😂😂
SUPER IDOL
20:10 I can't breathe. LOL
I pray to god 3:34 wasn’t just a coincidence cuz if not…nice
Love the Star Wars and All Star reference. BTW, Great Video Oversimplified I wish you the best and God Bless
No, America doesn't invade Canada in 2022.🤔
It took me 2 weeks to find this video
I will admit that invading Canada is an American fantasy. It even happened in the Fallout franchise.
KSP music
The last part had my crying 😂😂😭😭😭
I ate a bacon cheeseburger while watching this... it was oddly good.
7:57 isnt that shrek?
Oversimplified gonna make his own war between America and Canada for his speach
When we get blessed with this
Angry birds starwars
America literally gets spared every single time by the British lmao. Revolutionary War, White House Situation, This, the Civil War. America literally gets spoon fed every victory
Hey now, who else caught the Smash Mouth reference? Loved that. :D
13:30 what the hell dam that was 100% funny not gonna lie xd
Whenever there’s a new oversimplified episode I literally drop everything I’m doing
Well I'm disappointed the pig didn't get avenged
5:56 what the f-
7:57 OverShrekfied
Just so you know canada best America in 1812 and burnt down the White House any one remember that eh? I’m Canadian :)
33:26
The interesting "What if?" scenarios certainly involves the Civil War. If the Pig War did happen, would the Civil War be delayed as the southern states would remain in the Union, at least until the end of the Pig War? Or would the Civil War happen sooner, with the southern states seceding and plunging the Union into conflicts from all sides? Also, the southern states could publicly support and participate in the Pig War, but privately wrangle major concessions from the federal government (lest they do decide to secede in the middle of fighting), resulting in a much weaker central federal government. Might be a nice setup for alternate history debate and discussion.
Where’s Wales at?
Slay the sorry canadadas
Is it me?  or do you guys think that oversimplified this videos thumbnail looks more like a star wars theme thumbnail
I have been laughing for actual *days* at the scene at 4:06. It's just about the most American thing I've ever seen.
Glad to see this war wasn't covered in the local social studies syllabus. Local here learning new stuff.
32:31 the start of him going off on everyone! (except the British officers)
I know im kinda late to comment this and Oversimplified probably won't see it, but I would like a 7 Year War Oversimplified
Holy crap it's been 2 weeks?
The Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming hopped in there wagon and hit the ground running🤣🤣🤣
sus
That outro escalated quickly...
It's Canadian forces... You'd have to be at least 40:1
He is the only channel that i don’t skip the ads
6:30 pause and reed all the links lol
GRIFFEN WAS PISSED
Finally posted again
Next Siamese freedom war
I’ve always found it funny that oversimplified teaches you more about history then actual history class
"Jizz"ingham XD
Why did I randomly get hyped up at the ending lmao
General Scott: "Do not order Pickett back onto the island." What Harney heard: 33:14
I'm expecting you to be the first one to do a documentary on ww3.  Don't disappoint me.
rewatches oversimplified videos for the 25th time *smacks lips*  "mmmmmmm tastes like comedy"
This is by far the best one I've seen 😂
Finally watched it. So good, so long. I see why you are away between videos.
Holy shit 7 mil views
The only reason we don’t talk about Canada is because they are probably the most useless nation in the world
24:08 I am glad to say that the USPS now only takes 3 weeks to deliver a letter cross country, not 6 weeks. America #1 !
0:23 the beginning
I love u
The transfer into the Nordvpn ad was genius👌
Vietnam war next pls
Breaking news: joe biden has raised an army of Irish Americans to invade Canada. Something that famously worked last time
Did anybody notics that reference in 7:57?
This man keeps improving the quality of the videos more and more. I have to say, that ending was amazing, the emotion and feeling was huge lol keep up the amazing work!
Absolutely brilliant.  Well done.
we would just let you walk in so long as you kept things the same we wouldn't care lol
Even Though I am Canadian, I Agree with Oversimplified in the End
Plz do Vietnam war
I read the comments and already had a hint of what was going to happen at the end of the video but damn, that was hilarious.
Please make Julius Caesar and Hannibal Barca  Please🥺
7:57 all star
do the war of 1812
7:57 singing all star
im related to polk !~
im related to polk !~
Thinking about Harney and Pickett's subsequent careers, I think Harney was motivated more by some hotheaded patriotism than anything else. He had a few opportunities to defect to the confederacy but did not so although he was no abolitionist - he was also no traitor. Pickett was a traitor but also a capable enough combat General who never forgave Lee for the charge that bears his name where the world got a preview of WWI (the high water mark of the confederacy was an anomaly in what was otherwise a straight up WWI like massacre of Pickett's division).
Hey dude, (Req) i want the next content is about peloponnesian war or persian invade ancient Greek
History in 2022: Teacher: so children we will be learning about the pig war, with a video from oversimplified
Another racist anti-European humorous video.
So no one noticed that Florida was the giant BeNiS when America "expanded"?
Very informative. Very educational. Very entertaining. And yet, the question that still remains is what ended up being the parliamentary ruling on George's mole?
dang you should have done a nuclear "mushroom" explosion for the effects!
So much creativity and hard work went into this video. This one exceeded my really high expectations.
Do the scandivavin kalmar union, please
When Americans try to argue they have more than 300 years of history:
That one time when Oversimplified sings All Star...
The fact that Picket screwed up both the pig scandal and the entire Civil War is hilarious.
The ending killed  me 😂😂
War of Roses would be nice
Please oh please do a video on Alexander the Great wars, those are the best.
The end was the best
This guy post twice a year
I bought the plushy it’s so cute I love it
Abraham Lincoln’s todo list: number 2. kick McClellan in the shins. Me: that should be at the top, it’s more important than restoring the Union.

U should do a video on mexican American war
Ok if the shooting of a pig nearly started a war between the british and the americans let's not let a youtubers power hungry idea result in  a war between canada and the united states
A funny ending about invading Canada.  Even funnier imagining it being done on Sleepy Joe's order.
38:10  Well... he's dumb enough. He might.  Although he's not brave enough. Well... I guess extreme idiocy may trump fear, and lead to a false sense of power and then foolish bravery... maybe he is brave enough.
Thanks for your videos! Binged watched them this weekend despite hating history in school. Can’t wait to watch next one!  And the Hitler ones that YouTube has hidden from Wales 🤔
Imagine talking about islamic expansion this way.
Can u make a vid of winter war
SHREK

Canada is effectively US territory anyway.
So the moral of the story is: everyone's an idiot         Except for 2 guys
I'm sold, let's invade Canada.
America can't invade canada  We would lose our hat if we did
What about Quebec ?
This foo said “I hear voices all the time”

Only America can start a war over a pig
Can we consider this a mini war?
Never thought someone could make me want to invade Canada

Ya dam Canadians with there affordable healthcare
"But being an American  he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife carcked me up"
das rite! God bless America!
I like how the video about some random islands in north america had more to talk about then the american civil war (38 minutes is more then 34 minutes, which is approximately how long the civil war vid was
Oversimplified should make a Stalin video
I think Oversimplified is a bit sick of Canadians 😬
First time I've heard the animator's voice get so energized at the end 😭😭 love it
Please make some video on Indian wars!
“ alright, lets go out there and make the world a better place” 4:10 to 4:15
i think that the next oversimplified video should be about the vietnam war
7:58 it sounds like he is singing.
Wtf kinda ending was that 😅😅
USA + Canada = Better Country
video idea: Irish War of Independence in 2 parts
Could you do a video on Alexander Hamilton? I am so interested in knowing about him but I can’t keep a grip on all the information. No pressure, thank you!!
WATCH OUT CANADIANS 😂😂
Did anyone hear the all stars song in that?
16:00 the american pulled out an AK-47 which is actually russian
DO THE HISTORY OF ROME!!!
2:39 I love how whenever Americans lose a war they call it a draw 😂 (This isn’t a hate comment)
Man i have been waiting for your video for so long .....love from India
This "war" made me remember The Lobster War between Brazil and France.
Do oversimplified Vietnam war
37:08 TAKE CANADA
western canada needs saving from the eastern overlords, come get us.
😂😂😂
Hey did anybody notice at 3:37 it says “density” not “destiny” lol

I wonder if the oversimplified made this video before the retreat on Afghanistan.
It may not regard to the topic, but           Technoblade and Potato war
Bone Wars next, please
Pls great northern war
damn nationalism
ending scared me though
The British when they find out they didn't win the islands: I didn't loose, i mearly failed to win!"
Basically, this entire situation was because America was too stubborn, selfish and stupid to just respect the boundaries and give a little in return for the generous 49th parallel that the Brits offered. If America had just accepted the Columbia River as the boundary then everyone would have just been happy, but that wasn’t good enough for America…
I'd like to think the skit with Winfield belting Harney out of rage really happened and Harney never brought it up because it was too embarrassing to admit to having been belted by an older gout riddled man
You can make a video about the Spanish Civil War.
Vietnam war when?
The ending was so damn funny. Especially the part where you alluded to Biden actually being dumb enough to go to war with Canada. I mean, it's not like the man has a track record of making stupid decisions that damage and/or destroy the lives of the very citizens he's sworn to serve... right?....*reads the news* oh...umm... nevermind...
Please make a video about Crusade Wars.
7:56 hey now you're a rock star Oversimplified!
its the middle chanal
Pumping a duble Barrel shotgun is stupid
7:57 shrek part
🤣🤣🤣 couldn't have been better
We are all bunch of fools fighting for something that none of us can possess
-I'm sorry man, but I killed your pig. -YYYYYOU SWINE! -No, , the swine is the one I killed. I'm Lyman. -AAAAAAAAA!!!!!
40.000+ comments, wow... well done!  Everybody loves bacon!
Make a video on indian subcontinent's independence
Oh I just noticed... at 3:38 America said: "It's my *DENSITY*!" Excuse me, what your density?
USA: The country with a pathetic sleeping grandfather as head of state...
This is the most useless war
This is one hell of a video and i enjoyed watching it. Keep up the great work!
You should do a video about the spanish civil war
A curly tale, well told. When the trivial and the consequential wrestle, hilarity is sure to ensue.  Manifest Destiny was indeed intended to apply to the whole continent. Whether by force of arms or weight of gold, the monarchies were to be cleared out. But the civil war put that on hold and the threat of the Union Army eventually "liberating" the colonies of British North America, precipitated the birth of Canada in 1867. James Douglas kept the grubby Yanks at bay until 1871 when British Columbia joined the Maple Syrup Mafia.
Watch your backs, Canadians. Sleep with one eye...
31:15 dhar Mann?
And we did make it a better place.
37:05 I’m scared
5:00 ah yes vietnam map on the table
7:57 is that a smash moth reference 😂😂
um 37:53, i dont think that drake would be happy wit that idea becauseeee drake. is. CANADIAN...
People when OverSimplified runs out of wars to Over Simplify:  *Alright Bois, let's get this WW3 train rollllllling!*
Thought this would be about the Hatfields and McCoys because of the pig
Hey, I was wandering if you could do the following events:  War of 1812 Crimea War Vietnam War Opium Wars Boer Wars Timeline of Civil Rights The Troubles English Civil War History of British Empire The life and times of Catherine the Great.
find the odd 1 out 222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222228222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222
8:00 Oh you son of a…
4:11 had me in tears.
I love oversimplified it's just too good I wish my history teacher was just like that.
This is one of your finest videos yet!
I fully support the annexation of Canada.
7:54
I recommend to make a video on Indian Invasion of Portuguese Goa Or Indo-China war please
Please do the Vietnam War I really want to see you do it!
surprised you haven’t made your characters into NFTs, feel like that could be an opportunity
the idea of manifest destiny was justified...the execution...not so much
I laughed so hard at the end
Im not yet hitting the one minute mark and im already laughing with that not white people line, lol
Bro get this man subs for christmas
Ok, but the first part about the border and the map was something we learned last Friday in AP Human Geo.
Has no one else realized that this whole thing could have lead to the South having won the civil war?
Ancient Egypt next video??🤔
Oversimplified is clearly running out of wars to talk about,  which is why he's starting his own!  edit: yes I’m aware other wars exist, I just thought the idea of him having to start his own was funny
If America goes on war with Canada, that only means that all of started because someone made a video about a guy who was too lazy to complete the fencing of his potato farm.
Bruh Canada is not going part of the us
Fucken love the ending the very most keep up the awesome work
7:58 *_All Star Reference Moment_*
USA USA USA welcome Canada
Only 7.5 mil views and half a mil likes in 11 days
17:00 (I have to stop this video and I want to remember where I am)
Anyone else going off to look up Picket's charge Oversimplified?
The only bad thing about oversimplified posting is waiting another half year for the next vid 😫 but its totally worth it
So when that Vietnam war episode coming sir? :D
oversimplifed gotta do the fall of the roman empire
can we start a petition for oversimplified to make a "What if" series? that would be so cool
3:38: "It's my density!"
I have noticed oversimplified has some sort of grudge against Canada because if you remember and the American prohibition video he mentioned that some guy got whiskey but unfortunately it was from Canada and now hes prompting the US to invade Canada, what did Canada ever do to you oversimplified
What about the native Americans that suffered for so long? In fact, will we get a candidate president who is at least part native American? Also I'm in Mexico lol
Harney. Perfect Oregon hero lol
14:35 Sometimes is be how it be, that be just how it do.
All stars🤣🤣
31:54 I love this channel
7:57  He starts singing all star
fool-proof. I see what u did there :v
“British honor” lol
Well time to invade canada I guess
This man could name a video “The Rock War” and I would still click on it
38:11 AMERICA
This episode was made perfectly😂😂
37:00 this but unironically.
Oversimplified plush: $24.99  Small price to pay for snowman.
nordvpn man, the master of disguise.
M A N I F E S T D E S T I N Y
Dude I think the us government had to do with something at the end
Best part is 7:57 - 8:06
no no no... i think you mean the 'technoblade' war  in other words... the dream smp
32:28  Your welcome
I can't wait for the day he makes a video about 2020
Oh my gosh the end 😂
What the British thinks happened 30: 39
could u please do a greek mythology one!! ik it is not ‘history’ history but the animations make it sm easier to understand n tbh theres no good ones on yt
We must invaid
OK I just have to know, what is the name of the song that plays when the Americans enter into the territory of James Douglas?
38:03 i hate how people don't actually appreciate how hard work YouTubers do sometimes but then just complain. He doesn't do that. And then dislike without thinking Hey! Its actually hard to do these videos Idiots
You should make a video about the battle of the Little Bighorn
ah yes, if you cant decide just ask papa Germany in the matter
The Buchanan bit is simply golden and sadly accurate
Why ruin the peaceful country of Canada
oversimplified waiting for ww3
And our 🇮🇳 histroy
that ad transition has me dead
Gotta love those us americans and our guns
7:57 That All Star reference lol
So much anti-america sentiment. Kind of disgusting.
So the grudge held here by the English against the Germans helped sparked tensions for the first World War?
I think he chose to do this war just so he could do that ending😂
20:58 Did anyone notice that General Harney burns a British flag, yells he is the greatest and then thinks that he can be the president all in one scene?
I bought the plushie!
If canada's relation with America was bad. Then America had taken Canada years ago.
man I think you are forgetting that for a long time conquering your enemies and taking there land was as normal as breathing.  It wasn't just a white person thing it was a everyone did it thing.
Proud to be an American.. Fuck these Nation haters who think humor can hide their point.
can you do french indian war
5:55 had me laughing 🤣🤣
Loved the video, I didn't know about this before so it's cool to hear about something fresh. You should do more niche topics, like ancient Mesopotamia. I'm Assyrian myself and we don't get as much representation so I and many others would love it.
10 million Subscribers. FACE REVEALS 😎
5:45 best part
7:57 Is When he sings All Star
This is probably one of the best videos to ever exist on YouTube. Have been here since 2007 and haven't watched anything more than a few times, let alone a video this long... I bow before you, fine sir
That ending💀💀💀💀
Your other videos are great, this one kinda sucked.
this episode was the funniest one yet
Would you be able to do a video on the Texas revolution? I think that would be a good one
if sent our cobra chickens in america we canadians would have won
7:01-7:34, 16:10-16:40 This is a pretty funny running joke.
Hearing what General Scott had been dealing with Harney, seeing him beat the crap out of Harney while shouting "I hate you! I've always hated you!" feels satisfying as hell.

Almost watch all over simplified videos, great contents 🙏 can you do a about the crusades also? 🙏
Can you do a video about the War Of 1812?
Nobody.Oversimplified:TO WAR WITH CANDA
Somebody once told me that pig was gonna eat me, I ain’t gonna let that slide. They were being kinda mean, with their nose and their mouth right in my potatoes. Well, the Americans kept coming and they didn't stop coming, they hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground rolling, it didn't make sense to share Oregon, when they outnumbered the Brits over 6-1. So much to do, so much to farm,  so what's wrong with taking the Oregon Trail? You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never live if you don't grow. Hey now, you're a farmer, get your crops out, go farm! Hey now, you're a settler, go manifest, destiny! And all that glitters is gold, only in the Fraser Canyon. It's a cool place and they say it gets colder. You're warm up now, wait 'til it’s winter, but the map men beg to differ, judging by the cover in Mitchel’s map. The ice we slide is getting pretty thick, the water's getting solid so you might as well skate. My world is freezing, how about yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored. Hey now, you're a farmer, get your crops out, go farm! Hey now, you're a settler, go manifest, destiny! And all that glitters is gold, only in the Fraser Canyon. Hey now, you're a farmer, get your crops out, go farm! Hey now, you're a settler, go manifest, destiny! And all that glitters is gold, only in the Fraser… Somebody once asked “Could I spare some fur for food? I need to get myself away from this place” I said, “Yup” What a concept, I could use a little fur myself, and we could all use some less famine. Well, the Americans kept coming and they didn't stop coming, they hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground rolling, it didn't make sense to share Oregon, when they outnumbered the Brits over 6-1. So much to do, so much to farm,  so what's wrong with taking the Oregon Trail? You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never live if you don't grow. Hey now, you're a farmer, get your crops out, go farm! Hey now, you're a settler, go manifest, destiny! And all that glitters is gold, only in the Fraser Canyon. And all that glitters is gold, only in the Fraser Canyon.
When this is all over make a video oversimplifying the Covid-19 Pandemic
7:50
I love that you could get the exact number of sheep on San Juan,  but couldn't find Harney's motivation to start war.
noooo the pihg
7:57 somebody once told me...
Funny moment 1:13
This episode hit different, keep ‘em coming pops
The patriotism I just heard at the end of this video is more American than America itself
*I Think he wants to invade Canada*
1:53 hmmmm looks like a hint on Oversimplify's next video?     Vietnam war????
good video, but for some reason i dont like it when oversimplified puts emotion in his videos...so this was kinda weird...:]
Tip: THERES ALL STAR
Jaap van Dissel is the reincarnation of William S. Harney
you should do a video of the boxer rebellion
This was the best video ever!!!
I just flew out to San Juan Island yesterday and now I see this video, hooray! Thanks for sharing this part of history from my neck of the woods with the world
"I didn't say they were white people" I turned it off.. after I typed this. Sofa king we Todd did.
United States: Goes to war with Britain and declares independence because of taxes  Some dude in the PNW: YOU KNOW WHAT ILL TAX YOU OFF THIS ISLAND IF NEED BE SO HELP ME GOD-
My great grandfather who survived 2 ww once told me before his death 5 years ago that the three worst ways the WW2 could end were. 1. Germans conquer the world. 2. Russians conquer the world. 3. Americans conquer the world. The more I learn about americans the more certain I am he was right.
That ending hurt
Conflating password security with a VPN is essentially false advertising, would have thought better of a history channel priding itself on research to spit out that kinda line.
Why this video is recommended to me since 10 days. Even I haven't watch something related to it. I don't want to know pigs history
😂
Uh-huh. You *do* realize, of course, that Canada sits between the US and a nuclear-weapon-laden Russia, right? And that the Russians might have something to say about Manifest Destiny, a statement with the power of millions of atoms, right?
I’ve rewatched those like 7 times now
im suprised you know what Lake Louise/Banff is.
Great, just great. Now he even made Canadiens mad. What kind of crime to humanity will he do next?!
God I love America
at 15:47 you can see a nintendo controller
38:04 im a minor if you are coming at me from the back i will be extremely concerned
This is like history class  but I actually enjoy it
Lol love the ending
1:17 “ I’d stop worrying about Canada’s curves, and start worrying about your own curves.” I can here the mlg horn
37:08 it went just ridiculous and funny from here. 😂🤣
Didn't you guy just recently lost war to farmers in Afghanistan? What makes you think you can take on Canada?
You know this conflict was serious when its video is longer than the entirety of WW2.
hands down my favorite history channel
Man really  pumped a double barrel
Next video oversimplified vs Canada war
some potatos were also casualties
Man I never thought an American Channel would cover the area I live in Vancouver Island it's kinda weird to see imo
31:03 why does the pig sound like morgan freeman
Fartingdom The best name ever
The best transition to an AD ever
Wait shouldn't us be pig lovers not the British.
This whole video can be summed up as " *Yeehaw intensifies* "
7:57 yes
do one over the rise and fall of the roman empire
I have a reccomendation:  Japanese Fuedal Times, like Ieyasu Tokugawa and Toyotomi Hideyoshi
3:33 Florida
mate, you can't start a war with the Canadians they will just apologize and will never fight back to start the war.
Lmao 🤣 his reaction at 5:35
Plot Twist: The Americans didn't invade Canada. Instead, they invaded Iraq and Afghanistan.
Indigenous people? you mean Indians? Stop using perverted woke language man, be real.
Dude this video is amazing thank you for this gift
Please make an oversimplified video about the subcontinent
“lower canada” i think that’s fucking hilarious
I really want the next vid to be on the Spanish civil war.
The last minute and a half of this video has me ready to run through a brick wall. Absolutely electric ending! Where do I sign up for the invasion??
as an asian my opinion: "WTF WAS WRONG WITH PEOPLE IN WEST, DIDNTT THEY HAD ANY BRAIN CELLS LEFT "
"Biden is coming" less freightening threat in human history🤣
General Oversimplified Sir, reporting for duty
This video is Anti-American
We brits got the last laugh though, we sent you John Oliver, he’s your headache now.
SHOW US THAT MOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was poretty top notch
Honestly I couldn't give two sh*ts about what story you are telling in the video, but the way you put on the show is entertaining AF
Does anyone notice how much better these videos continually get
I miss the old voice :(
At this point, OS is purposely not making a Vietnam video for those who keep requesting it.
Mad man haha
The natives were worthless and weak it was conquering not colonizing
7:57
Anyone up for a Crusades vid? Pleaseee
Biden's coming? Hes barely able not to poop his pants....
Hi Minnesotan here lake of the woods is cool and big and good ice fishing really good fishing
Finally another video😁
im european and that ending made me wish I was american
Who here is watching this for the 100th time
order ordderr .... shut up ! and then he throws the cudgel at the member 🤣🤣🤣
honestly if that plush becomes an  actual thing i can see people buying it
3:32 Florida 🌚
The most energy he put in a video so far especially the ending
Being American he emerged with 4 pistols and a giant knife, seems legit.
what countries block the hitler videos?
Came here to hear War Pigs.
Don't invade Canada or we'll punish you yanks severely! We'll burn down the White House.
7:58 rap mode
Probably the funniest video in your channel.
Im gonna do this world so good :)
Hmm…if the US does decide to betray its closest ally and invade, I demand we call the resulting bedlam “War of 1812 part 2, 2022 Boogaloo”
"exagerated claims of Britsh villainy" The bed rock of the American emergence. No surprise Anglophobic American generals would try all that crap again.
3:31 wait. i just realised that florida is americas penis. What a horrible "cant unsee" moment!
The ending took an unexpected turn
you inspired me oversimplified. i have learned more in your videos than i do in school
Can someone explain what happened at the end ?? What was that rant all about ??
You should do a video on ancient rome! That would be fun. Love youre vids nice job
Evil Lyman and gangster Porky are literal nightmare fuel why did you make this
i want a george piddlingham pin
lost all respect for you at the beginning with that white people comment... the native Americans were enslaving other tribes during this time as well, but you have decided to call the founders of our country racists because it is the cool thing to do now a days... for no reason made an assumption that we wouldn't have expanded westward regardless or what race controls the west currently
Make a video with Vlad The Impaler
7:59
I live in 🇨🇦 canada
Здрасте из России. Мне нравится ваш подход к истории:)
The animations are so funny
Bro that sequence at 4:12 is so good 😂😂😂😂
Mention how the Portuguese empire competed with the Spanish empire even tho they had 1 man for 20 Spanish soldiers.
This is more tense than Cuban missile crisis or the entire cold war.
interesting....so france, spain and england killed indians, brought slaves to the americas, but you want to blame it on the Untied states and white people.
At 7:57 is te sickest all stars beat, that i've ever heard.
I hate America
(I do not own the lyrics and this comment, I copied from another video)  Somebody once told me, That oregon wasnt for me, I ain't the sharpest Joe in the shed, They were looking kinda dumb With the accent and the tea And the big, british flag, on their forehead. (Yeah) But the Americans keep coming, And they don't stop coming, They hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running, It doesn't make sense to share Oregon When they outnumbered the Brits more than 6 to 1, so much to see, so much to do, So what is wrong with being a 'merican? You'll never know if you ain't one, You'll never win if you don't try Hey now, you're american Get your game on Go, invade! Hey now, you are a murican, Get your boots on, Go, invade! All the manifest destiny It's gonna drive me nuts, nuts to Oregon. (Yeah) The brits tried coming Yet they didn't get rolling, Their carriages broke down midway through the long journey, Yet they didn't yet know that regardless The americans would have still gotten it With a couple of generals and a whole bunch of generals Their navy couldn't keep crying and whining in our faces, The world is on fire Itll never be yours, you british Still stuck over in Victoria! Hey now, you're American, Get your game on, Go invade! Hey now, you're American, Get your boots on, Go invade! It's gonna drive me nuts, nuts to Oregon. (Yeah) Hey now, you're American, Get your game on, Go invade! Hey now, you're American, Get your boots on, Go invade! It's gonna drive me nuts, nuts to Oregon. (Yeah)
Spain?
More colonial content please!
English civil war video?
ITS BEEN YEARS WTF
these videos are always worth the wait
damn.
Best video so far.
Who in the hell promoted an idiot like that to a general in the first place? There is demotion, dishonorable discharge....and so on, in place to deal with people like that.
This is music, I need a full version of this 7:57
Hey oversimplified how about you make a history about US invasion in Afghanistan and the Talibans
pickett using an iron as a tellephone is the best gag in the video
British People *Offer fair compromises* American people *MY WAY OR THE TRAILWAY*
38:12 Could imagine him waking up one day and thinking there's still a conflict going on over US/Canada borders.
A video about the settlement of Canada would be awesome. Or else a video about Vinland.
Man we are good alies whit Canada but after this video l think they don't like us anymore and NATO will fall. Do you know what have you done!
7:57 all star, oversimplified remix
Hi please make a video on India from 1600 till now. If its okay with you, you can go beyond 1600s
Can you make a video about the First Serbian Uprising?
everyone:can we get the vietnam war? oversimplified:WOAH!that is one hell of an nice pig!
Are we jus gonna act like he hasn't posted in 6 months?
Lost me at the start with that stupid joke
7:57 thank me later
33:28 the best
nobody:  my teammates in ranked: 32:28
Pay up bozo! 😂
I f**kin love this channel
Manifest Destiny is when America was glorious. I'm impressed with how the UK was able to keep the US from taking Canada, given that they basically got everything else and only didn't take Mexico after the Mexican-American War because they didn't want whites to interbreed with Mexicans
0:11 the man actually looked like my uncle in Kurdistan lol
just create a Roman empire video!!!!
31:03 Morgan Freeman
damn lyman should not have killed the pig... felt bad for griffin for a second there 😅
7:56 Its the best moment. Believe me
*Pulls out belt with malicious intent*
Did he just shotgun load a front loader *TWICE?* truly American.
“Go suck an egg”
I enjoyed all the way up until you made jokes about Canada becoming America
Пока американцы будут возится с Канадой, мы по тихому возьмём Аляску
23:45
7:58 thank me later
You're Youtube channel is the only channel where I look forward to its commercials. Simply by the way you hilariously segue into them from your stories. Then, of course, the hilarious way you perform those commercials yourself!
hate the slight political jabs that make a mockery of America
Stop making Americans look Evil!! America fought bled and died for those lands they won them fair and square!!!
so who was it who spoke to god crowd murmers i hear voices all the time lmao
33:30
14:36 my favorite part
Smith-Mundt Act was repealed.
Funniest thing about this video: Biden being portrayed as competent enough to win anything militarily.
Love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Please do the Spanish war of succession next
7:57  “Somebody once told me…”
the pig sounded like vetruvius from the lego movie
James Douglas! The one shot an Indian freedom fighter in 1858? What is he doing their? That make no sense to history, He is supposed to be in India! Hey get back you Douglas!
HOW ABOUT VIETNAM WAR !!!!!!!
OverSimplified: Not uploading for 6 months Also OverSimplified: Uploads after 6 months Me: Bout' time boi, Bout' time..
37:20
7:58
I keep rewatching one scene: 10:22  Order..... Orderrrrr....... SHUT UP!... **WHAM! (person smashes through wall)**  🤣🤣🤣
7:57 nice rap
Can you do an Industrialization video
the fact that wars are done over such petty things... and escalate to full war and greed...  humans never cease to amaze me
why there is no Vietnam subtitle
8:49 i felt that as an American
“Lyman, if you spare my life, I grant you three wi-“
"And being an American, he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife" Only way it could've been more American is if he emerged from McDonald's with a bald eagle on his shoulder with four pistols and a giant knife.  God damn, I missed Oversimplified
Yo, you should do the punic wars, or maybe Caesar’s life/invasion of gaul!
My school shows us your vids keep up the good work!
I thought the American tribes exterminated the Buffalo once they got access to horses.
The only people that we need to talk to not intervene is Russia and China we will give China Taiwan if we could take Canada and  Mexico
I loved this channel.it’s amazing it has 27 videos at the time and has like 5 mil subs
Sir, I need you to do an episode on the Hatfields and McCoys
38:04 what I heard when Canada said they'd reopen the country after the last year of the pandemic
Best one yet! Literally laughed out loud and spit out my rice while getting more educated on historical events. Love it.
Don't forget United States burn down there's capital building too a year before they burn down ours
I have never even heard of the Pig War before now. Now I know.
I'd rather Canada take over the US.
If Biden holds that much vengeance for Canada he's so old he's just pass over and die
One of the reasons I LOVE your channel is that it's truly quality over quantity!!
that spaghetti guy is everywhere
Punic Wars plssssss!!!
Please Please Please do the Texas Revaluation 🙏
This war should be called “the war with no casualties”
Man the Canadians are definitely missing the dislike button right about now.
Perhaps a little too heavy on the humor this episode.
7:57 HE SUNG ALL STAR
I love this channel
🤣🤣😂
This is crazy watching a video when I’m from Vancouver island
Jokes on you, Canada uses NordVPN
Biden ain't gonna do shit fucker can't even recognise a map, let alone point out canada on one Trump on the other hand... could be convinced to take canada If you asked him nicely In 2024
So pretty much its America as its ever been...so typical...
Why do I feel like he made this video *purely* because of those comments saying he doesn't mention Canada enough.
What did I see at the end
30:58 💀💀💀
Talk about brazil
Hot Single cake maker woud be a better title
Pause at 14:29 and look at it upside down It will say 8008132
that madlad harney woke up and chose violence
The only problem with these videos is I don't get a new one every month, week, day, hour. 😂 I am dying that was absolutely hilarious! 😂 Thank you! ❤️
3:41 dont associate us with them Americans
You should do the Mexican versus America war please
Plot twist: Nord VPN is a spy app
1:20  Apply cold water
oversimplified i didnt say they where white pepole  me: should i laugh its funny but i dont want to be racist
"And when we needed him most he brought bacon"
Thanks so much for covering this vital piece of Washington State history. I noticed you were even more absurdly over-the-top than usual. Is that because the Pig War was so absurd to begin with?
SHUT UP!  *throws something to people which killed 1 people*
ya.. uhhhh..... to much lol?
USA USA USA... sorry your speech at the end got me a patriotic boner 😂
Ik you dont have the time but i suggest to do like, Yugoslavia war specially The Kosovo War ❤❤
I love you so much❤❤❤
Ya know, I had to double check 'cause I figured there was no way there was a connection. But nope, the old cartoon Hey Arnold had an episode about the Pig War and somewhat a parody of it XD
Do Mexican-American War
As a Canadian that ending has scared the S### out of me
Aaaaaa Florida looks like pp
Is 7:58- 8:06 a smash mouth reference?
7:58 Love that Oversimplified All Stars cover
The Americans kept coming and they don't stop coming the hopped in their wagon hit the ground running it didn't make sense to share organic even though they outnumber the Brits to 6 to 1
ANNEX CANADA NOW!!!
I really don't care if he mocked us at the end,  He will still be legendary to me.
Can u do the Croatian Independence War
Being an old school courier would be dope lol "ah shit the dudes in DC are gonna hate this next month" lmao
I have a better idea: We declare war on the Canadians and then surrender unconditionally. One nation, no bloodshed. "The Mouse That Roared"
7:57
"And who is it who spoke to God?" - --- "I hear voices in my head all the time", "I thought it was Sharon's cat"  :-)
hi:)
"You never fail to make history more intetesting".
DRAKE

Don’t say he didn’t warn you, Canada…
Tbh, America was Britain's (or Europe) fault
Next The Mexican American War

In the future for a mini war could you do the scottish wars of independance please
i wouldn't be surprised if we tried to invade Canada with joe biden and still failed
"The place was RAMMED with sheep." That one hurt.
10/10 Keep it up. I love watching these videos, so informative and so well put together
Irish being great again
This is intresting
Oh ho.. This buffoon is that Pickett?!
Pig wars...the Oinkment Due
As a Canadian, the ending was hilarious
He returns
This American for you. Always wanted to take lands from  people and bully him.
The ak47 should have been m16
Oh, my God, the Imagine reference in the map room is hilarious!!
It’s insane hearing this bc I’ve been to fort Vancouver and seen the beaver pelts  and canons used in this was
'Bridish'
This guy makes History fun. Loving it 👍
So happy you did another one!!!

Get off your anti American BS🙄
3:54 “I hear voices all the time.”
33:30 my favorite part
Your plushie looks like a demonic snowman...  *and I love it*
haven't seen this man in years
Why did the Americans disagree to a sensible border twice
Next: Indian struggle of independence
YOURE BACK WOO
The ending triggered me.
In the interruption of 4:159  ibn abbas said every jew will believe in the christ before he die even if he was falling from a cliff while he fall he will believe (that does contain believing in muahmmed which wont help him at time of death also the prophet talked said 12 jewish scholar enter islam and all jews will be muslims)   Lastly John 16 He promised a comforter priests say its the Holy spirit but the Holy spirit was with Peter with Elizabeth with John with Mary and it was described to be a man eight times "for He will come" a spirit is also a name for mercy that is a name of Muhammed names   Some of you might say Muhammed changed the rules yet the Christ says if some one slap you on a cheek turn the other and in another verse it is said an eye for an eye and a teeth for a teeth   Also its mentioned in Songs of Solomon    Muhammad (PBUH) in the Bible. In the Song of Solomon, chapter 5 verse 16, we read in Hebrew: "Hikko Mamittakim we kullo Muhammadim Zehdoodeh wa Zehraee Bayna Jerusalem." It means "His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem  where "im" is a plural form used by hebrew and Arabic for Glorifying
I find the entire passage of Isaiah 42 interesting although admittedly I am reading the New International Version English translation. Isaiah 42:1-4*  1 “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; 2 I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. 3 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; 4 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”  The Arabian Peninsula in Arabic is called الجزيرة العربية Al-Jazeera Al-Arabiya which means the Arabian island. Because it is inaccessible due to the desert and water on three sides. Also the oases and towns scattered across the desert are like islands, as the Arabs would call camels 'the ship of the desert'. I have also seen the world "islands" translated as "coastlands" like in the Common English Bible or the Complete Jewish Bible. Isaiah 42:10-12  10 Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them. 11 Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops. 12 Let them give glory to the Lord and proclaim his praise in the islands.  In other translations "the wilderness and its towns" is translated as "the desert and its towns". Kedar is an ancestor of the Arabs who is named in the Bible and the people of Kedar are the Arabs (definition of Kedar). Additionally the verse which mentions Sela mentions mountaintops. Here is the Complete Jewish Bible translation of Isaiah 42:11-12  Let the desert and its cities raise their voices, the villages where Kedar lives; let those living in Sela shout for joy; let them cry out from the mountaintops!  I'm just assuming this translation represents a Jewish understanding of the text because of the name, but I could be wrong. Isaiah 42:20  You have seen many things, but you pay no attention; your ears are open, but you do not listen.  The book of Deuteronomy did so as well.  I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. [Deuteronomy 18:18] This is God speaking to Moses. The Jews said that the Prophet will be from the children of Israel, but when you read further, “No prophet ever rose again in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew with such great intimacy” [Deuteronomy 34:10]" The Prophet could not have been from the children of Israel. He must have been a gentile. Because otherwise, this would be a clear contradiction in the book of Deuteronomy. It can only be removed when assuming that the said Prophet was a gentile.  The 'whom i uphold' part is actually said to be intentionally falsified. The original hebrew word used there was the name Ahmad, which basically has the same meaning as Muhammad. But if you change it just a little bit, you get 'whom i uphold'.  some as the southmost part of the Desert of Paran (which scholars linked or identified with the Sinai Desert) or the entire desert, and others said that it is a collective name of a mountain range between the Zin Desert and the Sinai Desert.  I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. [Deuteronomy 18:18] There are some important details provided in this short prophecy. We are told that this future Prophet will be similar to Moses (“a prophet like you”). We are also told that he will be a mouthpiece for God as he will faithfully relay all of God’s commands (“he shall speak to them all that I command him”). This verse also reveals the people from which the Prophet will   arise, “from among their brothers”. An important question we must consider is which people does “brothers” refer to here? The prophet was a gentile. And the Prophet referred to here is Muhammad(Saw). It’s important to note that biblical geographers differ as to the exact location of Paran. However, they are unanimous that Paran is somewhere within Arabia. From Clarke’s Commentary on the Bible: He dwelt in the wilderness of Paran – This is generally allowed to have been a part of the desert belonging to Arabia Petraea, in the vicinity of Mount Sinai; and this seems to be its uniform meaning in the sacred writings. Strong’s Bible Dictionary also tells us that Paran is a desert of Arabia: H6290 pâ’rân From H6286; ornamental; Paran, a desert of Arabia: – Paran. Sebeos, a seventh century Armenian bishop and historian, when describing the Arab conquest of his time, wrote that the Arabs “assembled and came out from Paran” [5]. Encyclopaedia Biblica, edited by Reverend T. K. Cheyne, asserts: “Paran refers to the Arab tribal names, farran or faran.” The Bible tells us that Paran is the very place where Ishmael dwelt: “While he (Ishmael) was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt” [Genesis 21:21]   The dwelling place of Ishmael was none other than Arabia. The Dead Sea Scrolls, which are dated to the second century BCE and represent the oldest surviving manuscript evidence for the Old Testament along with other apocryphal books, link Ishmael, his descendants and Paran to Arabia: "And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of Keturah and their sons, went together and dwelt from Paran to the entering in of Babylon in all the land which is towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and Ishmaelite." Hence, the Paran (or Pharan) of Ishmael was certainly in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, we can narrow this location down further. Modern academic research supports the claim that Ishmael’s Paran was indeed in a specific part of Arabia known as Hijaz, modern-day Western Saudi Arabia. Irfan Shahid, one of the world’s most renowned authorities on pre-Islamic, ancient Arabian geography/history, stated that there was a place called Pharan in Hijaz, which belonged to the Sulaym tribe . Professor Haseeb   Shehada, an Israeli scholar and professor, in his translation of the Samaritan version of the Torah suggested an identification of the wilderness of Paran with the desert of Western Arabia which is known today as Hijaz  and when the Jews went to the Christ and asked for a sign he said children of men there shall be no sign except Jonah sign which is living three times when he was supposed to die each  in the sea a whale sallowed him   In the whale belly he was spat into the island  On the Island a pumpkin grew on him  So Jesus was  seen eating fish and honeycomb after his crossing by the disciples   seen walking after being buried and a rock was put on his grave by a women  and a third which he will comeback on    "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be." (Genesis 49:10). This means the Shiloh cannot be from Judah.
panda thumb theory how can the raccoon evolve into panda and grows a thumb what did he eat if he had no choice but to eat bamboos  how many human died from the cold or lived in snowy places and did not grow fur  how many were drowned and lived in shores and didnt grow scales and gills  how many died out of thirst or lived in deserts and did not gain a lizard like ability to maintain hydration or like how the camel blood is swollen  what about the mountains why their inhabitants don't gain feathers and wings from those who fell couldn't fly in the wrecked ship story darwin stated he didn't believe in darwinism
(UPDATED) - So I think I found out the British hats, I went through the long list on Wikipedia of hats and found the Caubeen, an Irish based hat that used to be worn by members of Irish and Gaelic groups similar to the Scottish Bonnets. I will make sure that this is the item but it seems as close as I can get.  I have thought of something on my mind. The British settlers are shown as wearing Greenish berets/caps with red banding.  Why are they depicted like this? I don't think I have seen it before in any historical images for settlers.   What might this beret be called?  Just those couple of questions I had and would be cool if anyone could help me find the answers.  ( I have tried google)
33:30
You’re alive!!!
You should cover the cake war, between Mexico and France, next in your series of funny sounding conflicts.
7:57 You're welcome.
The VPN kills these videos….
3:44 its sooo goood to expres the meme of ameeeeeriiiikkkoooooooo wooooooooooo
I can’t be the only one who was reminded of waddles when I saw the pig
Imagine singing all star without even knowing
Can u make video about Russia 1989-1993 year
Well, he did talk about Canada after all.
6-1
This is by far the best episode you've released to date! I hope you keep doing more one offs of obscure events in history this was really interesting. I never knew Pickett could possibly be dumber than I ever thought
This is why I hate USA they think they will completely rule the world and think others as weaklings and they blame Russia for the things Russia didn't do
Wake up oversimplified posted
1:00 INDEPEDENCE, BABY!
PLEASE LET CANADA GO...or else you have to deal with Great britian,India,Autralia and New zeeland,so dont even think about it -_-
asking german : "would you like to give land to your neighbour or to some random far away country " german : "random far away country"
9:56 didn't know eminem was british
I thought the creator had left the chat 🥺 great to know video are still going to be uploaded on this channel 😃🙏
This shows how stupid America is, never settling for compromise
32:31 was that a Half-Baked reference?
captain pickett looks like mr beast
The whole reason I want to move to Canada is because it’s not America XD
It’s not to late to invade Canada
More specifically USA is dumb not Canada.
Make one related to the colombian-venezuelan split, you'll have a lot of material in there

Ih my god this is hillarious ! Thanks Oversimplified you make teaching fun.
Hi
I think he saw gravity falls... 12:08  looks like waddles to me
One thing that is not overly simplified in Oversimplified videos: Guns. They are always fairly accurate for the time period and nationality.
_What a Masterpiece!_ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Make A Video On Indian Indepence History Pls! 😊
Can you oversimplify the war of 1812
7:57 What a surprise that was! This is the best thing ever!
Griffin has the scariest happy face I've ever seen.
Someone got roasted.aoooooooo
Do a video on Stalin
That last part of your rant to Canada has earned you my subscription sir..
That ending is so controversial I love it
Where is Technoblade
👏👏👏from france
Honestly, each video is better and better. I've not laughed so hard in weeks!
The pig would have also not died if there was a 4th barricade with a door
33:29 me when i finally go back in time and find the guy who invented homework:
Great speech about the ending, but what if I don't want Canada? Too much responsibility lol
Some Canadian broke your heart?
THE MOLE GEORGE
Looking at Google and Apple maps. Its americas islands
Bro this video is so good
As an American, I still think Great Britain deserves the islands
37:14
Is the plushie ever gonna come back
In 1812 America tried to invade Canada, but they lost that war. That and Vietnam are two wars they lost. Lost.
I seriously just watched a 40 minute video about a pig almost starting war
At 3:44 that whole speech Happens and that scene that happens at 4:08 I couldn’t stop laughing! 😂😂 there’s nothing more American to us then Mc Donald’s, Guns and B2 Spirit stealth Bombers!!
Do one about the crusades!
"lyman shot the pig" with that voice i thought he was gonna list terrible things that happened to get where he needs to be
How is a video about a war that most of us didn't know it existed longer then the 2 part WW2 videos.
The ending got me rolling hahaha 🤣
this is hilarious good chuckle
When the world needed him most he came back
U-S-eh?
12:03 Berkshire is pronounced "Barkshire" not "Burkshire". Just one more thing the British have given us: completely unpredictable ways of pronouncing words.
do a video about the great potato war (of technoblade)
What’s the moral of the story today?  Death to Canada
Interesting ending
Wish we had trump to stop these latin american colonizers from invading.
This enraged Hitler's father, who punished him severely!
Did OverSimplified just have a mental breakdown at the end?XD
I've just watched 40 minutes worth of video about a war for a pig
That'll dü pig... that'll dü
The nordvpn haircut was pretty clever. Ngl
man, thank god Harney didn't become president, can you imagine if we had a president who only cared about themselves and their glory, and was morally corrupt at every turn, and almost started a war for no reason? Man that would suck         oh wait, that's right, the 2016 election did just that.
Finally someone else realizes that we should annex and invade and occupy Canada.  the trump administration should have done it.  It's not like the Canadians can stop the greatest military on Earth.
Ah yes, the pig war ofcourse. I would like one technoblade here then please...
I think a Balkan war video would be awesome
33:29 when you finally catch siblings doing something and your parents let you decide how they’re punished.
7:57 oversimplified sings all star
Nice singing
7:57 :))))))
if you ever feel useless, remember oversimplified has closed captions.
ill make sure to not sleep and hold my AR15.
Can you make when nato bomb serbia in 1999
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss  Canada belongs to America
Try it Americans, last time you invaded Canada your white house got burnt down lmao
True Canadians know that we have never lost a war and never will
I love the placement of "lower" and "upper" Canada.
8:48 though looking at this map The british would still have access to the river tho
33:30 omg that was amazing 😂😂
Love these man. Always puts a smile on my face and gets me laughing. Keep it up! 👍
3:50 "I hear voices all the time."
Boi so late 😅😅
am i the only one that noticed that reference to the song All Star, by Smashmouth @7:57
Can you do the Balkan war
And this was all caused by a pig
BEST ENDING EVER
The Pig War was actually the most stupidest fight
1:26 : an Indian memer
21:28 Did you ask Ian from Forgotten Weapons before using his likeness like that?
This is amazing. I can literally see the San Juan islands from here and had no idea about this.
You promised to give us The Vietnam War “eventually”... I have waited for 3 years.
The funny part is there was a war with a similar name on Balkan peninsula at one point.
That Harney guy has a county named after him in Oregon---first thing I thought of when I heard the name.
you should do one about the war of the roses
this is honestly some of the best 30 minutes iv ever had lmao
As a Mexican, Canada, why didn’t you guys attack the US, we could have gotten rid of the states :(
I love his voice 🤗😍
THE LIVE CHAT WHEN THE ENDING BIT STARTED LOL- (I saw another comment somewhere else saying the last bit chat got crazy and checked it lol)
The next one is vietnam war.
As of now, Oversimplified has 26 videos. Not including this one. Some may be blocked.
just ten days ago wow
Yeah I could invision another glubby idiot drawing a line in the snow over manifest destiny!  🇺🇸👍
4:10 absolutely killed me 🤣
Maybe you could over simplify why we don't need to sell a Louisiana purchase to china to fund our military escapades. Like why didn't Napoleon jus keep the land and go into debt deeper and deeper if debt dont matter?
Wow, the last one is pure gold!  lol
President Trump should have purchased Greenland. This way we'd have Canada surrounded on three fronts.  Those no good Canucks will get what's coming for them and rue the day they dared to cross us. The pretend to be all nice and kind by offering you a hand when your car breaks down, but deep down, every American knows how ruthless and evil they truly are.  I can only hope President Biden makes the right decision.
So that's how Hornby Street got it's name.
Wake up babe, a new Oversimplified video just dropped
Look closely at the pop-ups in the ad break.
33:40 Far right side of the screen AMONGUS
07:57 all star ;)
War of the roses!!!
bucanhan 29:18
god i haven’t laughed this much in a while 😭
Whoa whoa whoa
Can you do a video on Andrew Carnegie, jp Morgan, and John Rockefeller?
I didn't know oversimplified had the capacity for more than two emotions
Too long, man. some of the sketches dragged for too long.
When you try to cut the cookies you share with your brothers 2:56
Manifest Destiny part 2: Canadian edition.
There are a few problems with the notion that we would invade Canada. First off, Biden would not suggest that. Second, it is a developed country that has aided the United States multiple times. Third, Canada may actually be a better country than the United States. I am a patriot, but I would rather keep the land we have now and not try invading Mexico or Canada. Fourth, Canada has always respected the United States. Lastly, we tried doing that not once, but three times. And guess what? All attempts were unsuccessful! America lost to Canada no less than three times, so why would we even try invading it if we're going to lose a fourth time? America cannot, will not, and should not invade Canada! Oversimplified, please stop suggesting this, because not only will it never happen, it also never needs to happen!
As president of the United States I now declare the entire territory of Canada and all its provinces property of the United States all of its citizens will automatically receive American citizenship and a permanent branding of a maple leaf so they can be recognized. Justin Trudeau will be down next weekend to kiss my feet on international tv as we celebrate my coronation or Democratic elected victory or whatever.
Mountain Beiber hair
4:11
Canada belongs to the U.S.A  MANIFEST DESTINY
Straight line? Straight line.
7:57 just a reminder for me
I don't know if anyone has already brought it up and I apologize if I'm repeating, but that Harney guy was even more horrible than this video implies. He personally beat a female slave to death because he lost his keys and figured he could beat their location out of her. She suffered from injuries from his beating for three days before she died.
30:00
7:57
I figured out America still owns those islands
I keep coming back to this video for the American politicians. them waving their arms around with pistols is hilarious
US-eh?
38:15 we both know biden if he did plan to do that which he isnt in control at all based on what hes said hed start by giving canada 4 trillion dollars of us weapons
Pfft, bring it AMERICA.
I like the Oversimplified outro music.  There.  I said it.
Any Turkish stuff?
Canada would either be called North Montana or North Minnesota
This has to be the stupidest story I've ever heard in my life. I seriously didn't know about this.
Please do the Vietnam war or the Korean War next🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏
It would be better if Canada invaded the USA at this point in time.
What if you were to redo the voice-overs on the WW1 videos
its been half a year he's finally back   Edit: nvm
That invade canada rant was truly the most beautiful thing on this channel
Thanks Nord VPN for sponsoring our favourite youtuber, really cool.
Where have you guys been for the past 6 months?!? I've missed you OS! Biden coming with a vengeance??? Haha! Yea if he can remember what he's supposed to be doing! 😂 Pretty sure the Canadians are safe from him
bruh you should know Canada Never Lost A War
I luv the audio engineering! Did I detect the Kerbal Space Program music around 12:30? <3
Correct no one died
Can you do albania wars. They are very interesting to search and read the history
Unbelievable
So the same guy who wound up leading a glorious (if suicidal) charge at Gettysburg brought America on the verge of war with Great Britain... all because of a PIG.  Why do we not hear more stories like this?!
Your Smash Mouth All star of the Americans keeping on coming is being recognised by a lot now!
7:57
I'm not sure it's fair to say they expanded west because the people already there weren't white. Europeans frequently battled each other for territory.
Over trying to spark WW3 so he can make more oversimplified videos
Oversimplified bars are fireeeee
For another part 1 and part 2 video you should do war of 1812
can you do a video on the war on drugs?
That ending had me dying of laughter hahaha great job as always
Biden has to be one of the stupidest presidents in a really long time.
hey i have a idea for a new series American founding father history you would tell their entire life from start to finish like George Washington alexander Hamilton and Tomas Jefferson
Wait, the BRITISH celebrated 4TH OF JULY with the AMERICANS?
Rdr2 reference
0
10:23 Best part 33:22 Also best part.
I'm Canadian and the ending gave me goosebumps
You ever gonna have nordpass or nordlock as background characters
You ever gonna have nordpass or nordlock as background characters
I’m crying
Anyday that OverSimplified uploads a video is a good day.
The return of the pig
I go to San Juan island and I can confirm very American, every store had American flags outside
37:08
"What the f-"
Pleased as punch that Oversimplified covered the Pig War.  As a lifelong PNWer, currently living in Whatcom, who loves to visit the San Juans, it is my favorite bit of ridiculous local history.
i dont like the american flag so i wouldnt want to see canada using it
Oh snap, it was *that* Pickett?!
nah the pigs had oil in them thats why they came
Try Vietnam or Korean War next!
C r a p
hi
greatest outro in youtube's history
Amé este vídeo XDXDXD
They threatened to arrest me...         Cqn I get a hug?
33:24 is FUNNY
This video shows a noticeable change in tone, in comparison to the earlier ones. Previously they were quite neutral, but now it's a lot of identity politics mashed into it. Why can't you keep petty politics and ideological bickering out of it, like you managed so well before?
We all know Pikket wore gloves
As a northwesterner, seeing the brits lose again and again makes me happy. OUR ISLANDS!
I think if America invaded every thing in Canada east of Toronto, those Canadians would cheer.
Hey OverSimplified, Please make a video about the Roman Empire Please
I love how lyman cocks the shotgun even tho it's a double barrel shotgun haha
Potatoes dont have seeds lol
Y'know what... I'm suddenly in support for invading Canada now.
Is his voice different/deeper?
Shouldn’t this be mini wars #5?
I love these history videos, please keep it up👍
Running the scenario in my head. US invading Canada would cause the UN to intervene, causing major trade sanctions against the US. USA's economy would collapse. Russians would make their move, prolly allied with China and Join with the Canadian military to drive back the American forces. But the Russians and Chinese would just keep going south and occupy the land. And Canada and the commonwealth would just shrug and let it go so long as they don't threaten Canadian lands (and also give them some of the pie).    And the world pretty much hates america. So... no one would care if america died but more concerned that china and russia got stronger. A china vs russia war would occur over land disputes. And then later WW3 as everyone goes back into imperialism again.
Canada, you're included in US... !!  <3
very conplezx for my ,loittle brain
Ok guys, hear me out. I know that one of the best aspects of Oversimplified is how it makes learning about true, historical events both entertaining and easy to understand, but think about, for a second, how fun it would be if in the future there were Oversimplified videos for different fictional series as well.   Imagine, Oversimplified: Star Wars, LOTR, Harry Potter..... so, much, untapped POTENTIAL!!!
I read that Pickett's charge was under order from Lee as a desperate hail mary to change a losing battle. With this story. I'm kinda thinking Pickett may have just ordered this by himself because he's a moron. Because we're talking General Lee here. The Hannibal of the confederacy. Why would he order an idiotic charge like that?
3:34 why is florida there?💀
this did happen. i was there.
ref !
I'd love to hear how America invaded Montreal and Quebec city... Oh that's right. They never took Quebec
This is my an amazing video
I am sure tons of cocaine had runned during the making of this video
The Canadians got what they wanted. Oversimplified to talk about Canada.
Not Brain Death or Cardiac Death, But Killing Professor Li Huige, professor of pharmacology from University Medical Centre Mainz in Germany, described four types of organ harvesting in China based on witnesses’ testimonies and publications. The first two types concern prisoners sentenced to death, and last two types involve prisoners of conscience and political prisoners. Although the term brain death was often cited by Chinese doctors as having occurred prior to the harvesting of organs, numerous publications from Chinese medical professionals showed otherwise. Professor Li said that “[it is] neither brain death nor cardiac death. It was a living patient who was killed by the doctors by removing the heart.”  Professor Li cited one paper from Henan Medical Research that described heart transplantations performed at the Chinese People's Armed Police Forces Hospital in 2001. He pointed out that at that time, there was no concept of brain-death or related legislation yet. For heart removal, systemic heparinization was performed. But systemic heparinization can work only when the heart and the circulation is working. “So, the person is also not a cardiac dead patient, either,” he said.  “Detailed description showed cold cardioplegia solution was delivered to the heart through the aortic root until the heart stopped beating. This means the heart was beating and a cold cardioplegia solution caused cardiac arrest,” Li explained, “So this person, this so-called donor, was not a brain dead patient, was not a cardiac patient, was a living person who was killed by medical professionals. This very likely is a situation of organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.”  David Beyda, Chair and Professor for the Department of Bioethics and Medical Humanism at the University of Arizona, said people were put in prison as goods to supply organs, instead of being treated as human beings. In other words, the surgeons that conducted transplants were actually killing them.
Wow
petition for oversimplified to do a greco-persian wars video
Can you do (Over simplefuyng a country).
Can you make videos on MLK, The Civil rights movement,  women's suffrage/ women's rights movement? 🙏  I love your channel.

ILOVEIT🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
I really feel like you snorted two lines and recorded this.... I'm loving the energy
7:58 somebody once tell me the world is gonna rolling
36:27 The Brits were really aheads of their time back then. They already knew that US-Americans would get unreasonably pissy over their flags.
Me and my friends are planning the attack on Canada
* grabs musket and torch *oh well, time to set fire to the white house… again 😈
In Canada they come to the US for expensive operations like MRI's because the waiting list is so long. This is your reminder that the Canadian Healthcare system isn't all that morons claim to to be.
But the Americans don’t stop coming and. They don’t stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running didn’t make sense to keep sharing oregon when they outnumbered the brits more than 6-1
make a video about the dutch war (Eighty Years' War)
7:57 The Americans keep coming and they dont stop coming hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running! My God that line is good
Well, I’m off to *INVADE* Canada! They’ve had it too good for too long…
wow fantastic video as always. It really is funnier than the previous videos.
America is still full of Harney's and Picketts. They're called Republicans now.
Why does nordvpm man look like blue hair
3:40 no offense to Americans...but that's ridiculously accurate
Well I’m convinced, let’s invade Canada
15:44 i just noticed the top poster—
I’ve never felt as patriotic as an American as I have while watching the last 2 minutes of this video.
Hi oversemplified i am so sad right now because i live in Italy and with spedition It cost 55 euros  So nothing 😭
The All Star reference in 7:58 is so fxking good
Sponge bob super idol is the best version
I like how this was in my recommended among technoblade videos lmao
I love how oversimplified made his channel and just started spitting facts
This is just the spiderman meme all over again
Can u post more please 🥺
Excellent!
7:57
wait 7:58

did you notice him sing all star?
such a funny ending for an American but we europeans are scared especially with the whole crimea crisis love your videos but this is a touchy subject that I think you shouldn`t joke about at least right now
The pig had it coming.
Hey, could you please do a video about the SpanishCivil War (1936-1939)? I would really appreciate it, thanks!
And being all American and all comes out of his tent with four guns.. xD

Do the 2008 mortgage crisis
Can you do a video of the Spanish Aztec war?
Manifest d e s t i n y
Steamy mcsteamface, for the tourist boat? ROFL
Eh, this one crossed the line. It seems less like a joke than it should.

7:57 - 8:06 there is all stars

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 great way to end the video!
Bro the rimes at 7:58 were fire man
That Porky looks Like Mabel's Pig Waddle...(sorry, but the resemble look alike) and i couldn't help but Imagine if the scene 19:00 someone just went to her and said they kill her pig... and then snap.
German French war 1870 pls
Great vid. Loved it! But when are you gana do Rome?
This pandemic has taken a dark turn for me. So at the risk of sounding like an edgelord i will reccomend a few the for the next topic. 1. The crusades  2. The JFK assassination 3. The fall of the roman empire. I love this channel, keep up the awesome work.
3:37 flordia sus
Is it just me who realised that it's spelling is wrong at 3:36 ?? 😅
God bless America
Best ad segue ever. Even better than the subtlety of @LinusTechTips.
Biden can't even make a speech I'd love to see the United States fall to Canada
I thought this was going to be about tecnoblade xD. still a good video
Love these videos.
I love your videos and they teach me so much.
Your back!
OverSimplified posted. Christmas came early
I would stand in front of all those American guns for that pig
Completely understandable that this video made me annoyed at both America now and in the 1800's
7:57  POV: your rapping against britain
These videos make my brain bigger and thoroughly entertain me
do philippines
that ending was the greatest thing 2021 gave us by a mile.
The speech at the end I got one response to it U S A  U S A  U S A
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. It didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon when they outnumbered the Brits more than six to one."  *Coincidence? I think NOT*
3:43 FarCry5 In A Nutshell
Great content, however I believe you begin to overuse with the jokes, special effects and so on. They are really nice when you spice up the content with it, however they shouldn't become the content itself.
When oversimplified sings all star:
I watched this Pig War video, and "War Pigs" by Black Sabbath is showing up in my recommend and I'm not complaining one bit!
Years from now historians will point to this video as the cause of the devastating US-Canadian War of 2022
America see a random land                                        Also America “ it is my god giving right to take this land for my people “!
Can you do Chernobyl/dissolvemt of the USSR next?
I hear his voice getting deeper, and the content getting even better with every video. Cracking content
WE GOIN NORTH BAYBEEEEEE
Spuddy😂😂
so the US has just gotten independence and already trying to invade other countries (Canada, indigenous territory). looks like it lies in their blood.
Is nobody gonna talk about how the thumbnail really looks like a Star Wars wallpaper
The plush looks cursed
36:57
I never knew americans and brits could talk sheep 13:27
Finally he’s back
Oversimplified posted. Christmas has come early
This dude is underrated af
32:27 General Scott is mean... :'(

Murrricaaaaaaaaaa💪💪💪💪
I love how in the background the Mexican border changes and even has the independent Texas.
Can you do The American Indian Wars Oversimplified?
" I kinda just... killed your pig" DOOM MUSIC INTENSITIES
14:29 I see what you did, and I approve.
By 4:16 I'd had about all the PC woke bitchiness I could take for one day.
why do you never talk about Islam history?
United Nations:You crazy OverSimpled: Umm no United Nations: Canada independent state
finally new video !!
16:01 why an american are using ak47 is he a soviet spy ?????
The legend is back!
Dear Canada, we Americans do not want to conquer you. We already have enough problems as is, we do not want more. JK love from America.
Great film. Could you please do "the Crimean war" oversimplified, more specifically, the battle of Balaclava. From Christian from Something Awesome.
Back with a bang 💥😂
I'm expecting the usual animation with genius jokes (good, smooth and on point), but this one is pure gem. Enhance "incident" in 09:17 Whimpering Douglas face Brutal beatdown with Harney's scream in 33:25 And the best of all, USA!!!! USA!!!! USA!!!! Can't stop replaying this video over and over and over......
BUCHANAN
Your never talk about India
What the hell was the end?.. But it was funny
Do the 1812!
USA will invade Canada in around 2060s according to Fallout
Make a video about the Pak-Indo war
Pretty close, but you got quite a few things wrong. Fun video thou.
that plushie is literally 2 white balls as the body, with 2 arms and two black dots as eyes.  i fucking love it, im broke as shit tho so cant buy it sadly:(
He is gonna do a world war 3 one in 2022-2030
This is what happens when you let SJWs play with history
history yayay
Video on Spanish civil war??
post more often please
My dumbass thought the pig wars meant the bay of pig invasion. And I was waiting for when the Cubans are going to show up
Can we do the 80 Years war?
That Rant at the end of the Video terrified me, but seriously why are people complaining about him not talking about Canada enough?   A lot of countries are mentioned in his Videos and some aren't also mentioned, so what makes Canada so special?
I’m looking forward to one day that Oversimplified will make videos about VietNam War
Lol I'd vote for Biden over Trump if he invaded Canada, like FINALLLY!!!!
U-S-eh 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m dead now. The other casualty of a war that never happened. The Canadians lost a pig, america lost me. I’d say we’re even now.
Wow, the propaganda in this video is crazy. History doesn't care about today's standards or trends, it's facts  recorded chronologically.
I remember being told about this war when I was a wee little 6th grader on a field trip to the San Juan Islands.  The British camp was very pleasant. It had a nice little lake, surrounded by trees, and we visited when the temperatures were pleasantly warm.  In stark contrast, the American camp was windy, cold, and was a much worse place to eat lunch.
could you ad vietsub :<
I only just really noticed that oversimplified has over 5 million subscribers and he’s only posted 24 videos that I got to say is very impressive congratulations
I'm ready for the war. America 2 better be ready.
Oversimplified Videos we need: -WW1 Remastered -Texas Revolution -Lewis and Clark Expedition -WW2 Remastered -Roman Empire
in Iran we are killed 1000 people a day please tell the bloody story of Iran please  we are suffering make a difference
In Iran we are killed 10000 people a day please tell the bloody story of Iran we are suffering
Ok, and our glorious leader Queen Elizabeth II will call upon her 2.5 billion people across the 50-55 or so countries of the commonwealth. 15 countries, and 160 million people of which she is directly the commander in chief of. Yea, we could put up a better fight than you think!!
Because Mexico is also apart of North America, I believe we should manifest destiny to the north and the south and rename our country to “United states of North America”  But USNA doesn’t sound as good as USA
I love how those b2s swooped in and blew those cows away. 4:12
His piggy is so cute 🥰
7:57 aside from the terrifying ending. Oversimplified do be having those rhymes tho
Im dtf some Merica's jusT for lols
What the video was said to be: How the Canadian-US border became a reality. What the video actually is: Calling out the US’s cold-hearted hypocritical imperial power hungry history that no one actually talks about.
Bro it hasn’t even been 2 weeks yet he already has 7.1 million views
Chinese civil war please
You know, the way this video shows america trying to spread is kind of one sided. That’s how humanity in general acts. Many Native American tribes killed each other for land that changed hands many times.
Make Philippines
Vietnam War next please
I’ve seen every single Oversimplified video there is, but that ending just scared me.
Shame that I‘m not able to pay via PayPal to get myself one of these plushies.
7:58 OverSimplified sing all star
james douglass was half black (has nothing to add just was kinda funnee)
Even is the next video coming??
the longest oversimplified video
I thought the ending was going to lead into an ad for age of empires or something,
FINNALY
I knew nothing about that, great video!!
When he said "but how different could things have been?" I already knew where this is going lol
All stars refrence spotted in 7:57
Biden doesn't even have the balls to forgive student loan debt. He wouldn't invade Canada!
Heyyy.. you remember the Vietnam war you talk about in the cold war p2 video? When will it comes out, I'm still waiting for the war of the talking bush
Bro plz upload a new video
God I have Americans
I used to live on Harney Street. Glad that ding dong got a street named after him.
Omg the plushie is soooo cute
I'm getting the feeling that OS voted for Biden and maybe has one of those puke propaganda posters on their front lawn. the one that says "love is love" and "science is real". That sort of hogwash.
Can you do a video about Singapore's riots in the 1960s
why was this video just a little more unhinged than normal...
you better have one eye open when you are sleeping one eyee~
OverSimplified a nationalist confirmed 37:30
3:51 Gen. 9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
best oversimplified video ever, humorous, informational and funny and the ending is god tier
3 things: 1. Dude! Uncool for keeping me waiting that much until a new video came out 2. Awesome reference to All star 3. What such an american ending
Tell yah what, give us the Stanley cup and you can have ONE province of your choice.... -signed ambassador of ALL of Canada
Hello, can you make an oversimplified version of Philippine war???
Somebody once told me, American would be coming
Can you do the Mexican revelation, my mom would greatly appreciate it.
Winfield Scott remains one of the most underrated generals ever
Ohhhh boy. Captain Canada is going to be real after this video...
Steamy McSteam Face!!!!
Can anyone tell me what song that is at 16:27
oversimplified’s voice acting lyman is a 10/10
every time oversimplified posts, I just get excited and drop anything to watch his video, his videos just make me happy
Why is this not a Netflix series?!
Poll: do you come from a ---- down under? (Upvotes count as votes)
the raw emotion in that ending is beautiful... brought tears to my eyes
I don't know why but I have a weird and strong inclination to sign into the army specifically to charge into Canada at full speed.
I better pack my bags and run now
pure talent
This released as I was writing an essay on this, thank you very much. I did a lot of… paraphrasing.
This doesn't feel like oversimplified, since the quality has gotten so much better.
29:18 I just wanted to point out how perfect was Buchanan screaming. Absolutely priceless voice acting right there.
philiphines make a stroy
As a Canadian, that ending was fucking pure gold bud lol
I would love to see a 30rd year war video
jesus, that end of video... XD that was... divine. i never heard your voice like that... it was beautiful. :')
FJB
I was going to write a long and detailed comment about how much I appreciate your content, but instead, I think I will oversimplify it down to "I love you".
USA USA USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Any chance you can do a video on the Viking age at some point?
Make a video based on an event < create an event to make a video later
Just graduated Infantry OSUT and now I have my phone. What a treat lol.
Wow
what about Mexico? XD
Best ending ever
No one wants Canada lol. We have drake already.
Canada : a very nice and friendly neighbour to USA  USA: 37:24 Canada:dude uncool
7:56 Best scene
1812 wasn't really a draw though? 🤣
Idk why but I kind of wished he used the sheep from the Falkland’s war video, those were both adorable and the right amount of derpy
I said straight line just as the two at the beginning agreed on straight line. I’m dying.
When this video began I was gonna say bless the Canadians for being Canadian and giving the continent some good publicity while America continues to be run like an entire country on a reality TV show, but by the end of it I felt really patriotic about America.
Just curious, what was the song playing when the Americans encroached onto James Douglas’s territory?
Most dramatic betrayal ever: German Empire: gives a couple of islands to the US US: declares war on Germany and defeats Germany during WWI Tragic huh?
Lol love the end!
I live on those islands, in BC. They are called the San Juan islands
Hell yeah America 🇺🇸
My new favourite phrase when disagreeing with a American... "Lets just draw a line down the middle".
I love that this could be linked to Technoblade's potato war lmaooo along with his Anarchy in Dream SMP XD
I'm almost disappointed there's no war at Point Roberts.
The legend is back.
Why did it take so long to post
8:38 & 37:25  Canada and México saying one to the other: "So far from god and too close to United States"
Ahahaha amazing video man! I love it when you explain uncommonly known parts of history. Keep up the good work!
but look at look at those curves, id worry less about canadas curves and more about your curves, background: OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!   Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true).   . And sorry if I annoyed you. .  .
If that happens
And exactly why would Biden invade Canada? You had me until that. I may unsub if this continues
Drake 2024
Awesome video. So funny it was great
This was well worth the wait. And that outro, good god, I laughed so hard I went into a coughing fit. Thank you for all your hard work, you're probably my favorite creator! Happy holidays!
I'm so happy a new oversimplified!!!it's been so long!!! Please 🙏 make more I love these videos 🤩
7:31 😂
AND THIS TIME, HES COMING ON A BED

I never knew about this one. Of all the things to start a war over. A pig of all things...
The outro is dang cool
Could you please do Alexander The Great Oversimplified.
"Lets get out there and make the world a better place" I actualy laughed out loud :))

37:21 he is forgeting the Canada is technically still under British rule to this day just like Australia and new Zeland and a few other of their "Colonies" funny idea thou
Watch out canada
I think you should make a video explaining the Boxer Rebellion.
7:57 Oversimplified sings all star
jesus the last minute fucking killed me
I would love to see one of these about Buchanan's Blunder
I just love these videos! How about a two-parter about the Thirty Years' War in the HRE from 1618-1648? I mean, it was a war on so many fronts, that in the end no one really knew who was fighting who, that basically writes itself ^^
Tbh, I've never laughed this hard on an Oversimplified video, ever

Can't wait for the Canada-US war: oversimplified
Now presenting: The Oversimplified war, starts off with some angry weirdo.
Is oversimplified narrator also oversimplified animator? I hope it is cause if not it will ruin my fantasy
Why does the thumbnail  look like Star Wars
Fun fact: The Hudson’s Bay Company in Canada is still open. It’s the oldest company in Canadian history and still active.
Do the Balkan wars pls
i hope he keeps going the way he is, growing, and that he doesnt get greedy and end up like those washed up utubers
Please do the Nobunaga/Tokugawa Edo period next!
7:56
Benjamin got rekt
04:10 one guy with McDonald’s 😂
I would say this is one of my favorites but I love all the videos.    Mostly the obscure history events that no one knows about.   Looking forward to Vietnam and possibly Korea
Do the Irish war of independence
Okay first of all Biden is a weak president he wouldn't have the mental fortitude. To try to conquer Canada and on top of that he's half asleep most of the time. He'll probably sleep through the entire war and then gingerly. Wake up to see what's happening and he'll be shocked that there's a war going on.  And that's coming from me an American who was born and raised here I don't think Joe Biden knows where he is half the time.
I hate when the Americans win
To be honest, America would have an incredibly hard time trying to take Canada. They can invade easily enough, but it would basically become Vietnam but on a much, MUCH larger scale. How? Because of the sheer amount of land Canada has. Good luck finding us in our arctic hellhole you bloody yanks!
You.. actually have quite the voice for making speeches. I was very inspired by that last part to really invade the great white north. And I am from Germany.
7:57 best rap
Is it just me or does the pig sound like Morgan Freemam🤔🤔🤔
Well im quite got into laughing my ass off in this deal of American atoracities NGL . Take it with a lil grain of salt
we need a Vietnam war oversimplified plssssssssssssssssssssssss
…you okay buddy?
Okay, so we from Ontario will be the first ones right?🤣
4:10 You know I had ludricous expections how you would animate this.  You blew them to the moon.
26:27 "Steamy McSteam Face" And _that's_ why you don't say you'll name your ship after whatever gets the most smoke signals.
When the world needed him the most , he returned
YES!!! PNW history ftw!!! Finally, our ridonkulous stories shall be known (beyond Twilight)!  Fun fact, the cell service on the San Juan islands is Canadian. You're closer to Vacouver Island than WA state and the towers will send you messages about it (visited there last Summer, still up here in WA lol). Also, seen The Ring? The ferry that the horse flipped out on and the islands with toaster bath man? Yup.   Edit:  0:31-0:51 As if white people didn't set the precedence of conquering each other throughout their history, pretending Britian and France and the Norsemen didn't colonize and expand their own territories. You even mock Henry VIII about needing to conquer a bit of France in his own video fam! Or the conflicts between the Scots and Welsh and Irish down to the Anglos and Saxxons... How about the various Italian city-states, or even Rome and it's broad imperial history and the previous Greek history of expansion.   As if every other color/race hasn't done the same among their own peoples and regions and kingdoms. I'll raise you an entire Chinese history, Babylonian/Assyrian/Zoroastrian history, the Korean peninsula's history, Mayan, Aztec, know what, everywhere. Point to a place on a map and there's been human civilization expansion and power grabs.   As if every other border hasn't faced some kind of racial tension. Like Egypt and the Levant hasn't gone through various phases of rulers. Pretending Spain doesn't have Arabic influence and a huge chunk of Islamic history, like the Moors don't exist and never conquered the Iberian peninsula in white man's Europe. Pretending Mansa Musa didn't conquer through both trade and war to become the richest man ever, and he was black selling black men and women as slaves. Pretending the Silk Road didn't have racial blending and authoritarian regimes controlling sections and conflicits. Pretending the Mongols didn't spread their DNA everywhere they went.   All I'm saying is if you're going to make extremely racist jokes like this, calling out one color and insinuating that was the entire moral crux of a position, it's important to point out that (for what it's worth) that was merely what's been done in every human history. In every government. In every regime. Be it Idi Amin or the Mean Moustache Man we can't Voldemort by YouTube or Stalin or Vlad the Impaler or Noda Obunaga or Shaka Zulu. By this standard, the US Westward Expansion was done by treating the Indigenous Americans as equals, through war and deception as has always been done. Was it fair or just or morally right? *NO. NO IT WAS NOT.* But it wasn't anything new. What is new is this mindset of "white bad because mean, must make fun of white men to make them feel bad for their history and reflections" when in reality, it seems to be an intrinsic part of the human condition.   Hugs to everyone, my human family. May we learn to love each other and laugh as we find solutions instead of bully ourselves and others for political street cred.  Wow... Here I was excited about a ridonkulous story about my home region and I was hit in the face with modern identity politics and racism as the opener. Way to make a story about government, nationalism and idiots in charge ruin everything vs how the people got along with the one exception of a pig getting into a lazy man's garden... aka idiots. Seriously, disputed territory for 12+ years, dual occupation, yet nothing much broke out beyond the pig incident, and yet here you start it off with modern hate. Thanks fam, that's the representation my PNW culture needs. :'(
7:57 its all star
Next vid can you do the Toledo War it just seems like it fits in with the Pig War
I love the part at 4:07
I love the way you make fun of every country including the USA
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG ITS OVERSIMPLIFIED i literally screamed
Please do The break up of Yugoslavia
Hands down, one of the best videos I've ever watched on YouTube
J.J. McCullough: "Modern Canadian politics is based on being different than the US"  Me after watching Oversimplified: "See Canada, you've always been this way."  🎆🇺🇲😎🇺🇲🎆  (Edit: This is just a joke, I know JJ is not the best Canadian political pundit to reference.)
Oversimplified needs to modernize the history syllabus and make his own Netflix show,
you should make a video on the franco-prussian war
I can't believe Harney got to have a mountain named after him smh :/ (to be fair, it was named before this incident, but still)
US will not invade Canada. Latin Americans will invade Canada after they finish with the US.
ur videos are very good and funny
Wait a minute- US westward expansion also trampled on the claims of France, Spain and Russia, who had a few scattered white people around at the time. They didn't seem to care about that either. Of course, this debate presumes there is something unusual or inappropriate about national expansion.
I want "Very Bitter Douglas" as my Highland Clansman name.
33:30 is so funny XD
as a American Born man living in Toronto, id 100% join the American side of a war, not cause man power, but because i REFUSE to associate with the Birts 🤢
To all my Canadian friends I declare than the new Kraken-Canucks rivalry should be called the Pig War.
This one was a bit....different.
Fun fact: $100 around that time was about $3500 our time. And one pig our time is worth around $60-$500. So yeah, makes sense why he didn’t want to pay that insane sum for one dead pig.
DRAKE 2024
Me when no noti
12:43 - 13:31 Best Part and also  30:26 - 33:35
7:56 All star lol
leaves for another 2 years
Oversimplified to ensure he doesn’t run out of content, decided to start a Canadian invasion, so he can make an over simplified video about it, later.  Genius!
USA is littelary the worst country in the world no way they would be able do conquear canada
Canada was invaded by the United States after the white house watched this video.
can you please  do the anglo dutch wars
Great video as usual...but that ending was amazing :D
can you please do the dutch revolution/80 years war
You should do a video on the Irish revolution!
*insert comment about Technoblade's great potato war*
I have the sudden patriotic urge to invade Canada after seeing that ending. TO ARMS BROTHERS AND SISTERS!!!!!
lol i knew that end was coming
do War of 1812.
Man im still waiting for oversimplefied "vietnam war"
Waiting 6 months for a 38 minute video is a good trade if you as me
So that video didn't end like I thought it would. I approve!
16:31 What song is it?
As an American I will also raid Canada with hugs.  They have hugs to take, and I'm a greedy American gonna take every one of them.  They gonna catch me on the streets dealing hugs.
18:22 The word bubble: "Just a man and his potato." The closed-caption: "Just a man in his potato." Given the context, somehow I suspect the closed-caption is more correct.
the power of maple syrup
Gotta get away from the gimmicky stuff. All the exposition probably doubled the video length for no reason.
ONE UNITED NATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR GLORIOUS PRESIDENT... DRAKE! "My glorious Certified Lover Boys..." LMFAO
!SHREK  ALERT!        i warned you...                            okay, i see you want this..                       7:58
a video about the quebec sovereignty would be nice
yeah good luck buddy. canada has never lost a war. and what was that about vietnam?
That ending about Canada destroyed me. Never heard the narrator's voice get that animated in the history of Oversimplified 🤣😭
Look at his curves.  Nope too far. Perfect
whenever someone asks why politics so convoluted and there is always too much bureaucracy to deal with to do anything, this is why. if we don't figure things out to the last decimal, people will find a way to start a war over it.
The US didn't really deserve those islands. Letting such incompetence lead troops, provoke and antagonize the opposition, constantly arming them selves and force their way through a land like savages. I wouldn't let them on land without a leash.
Just realise at 3:38 the america country says "ITS MY DENSITY" instead of DESTINY lol. Still love the video oversimplified!
...Let's Go, Brandon!...
Would be hard to win a war with Canada when they have canadian geese
Holy shit! Your video keeps on getting funnier! Love the work!
0:24 I see Russia.
You should do a video on Martin Luther
12:00 KSP music
whatched it 13 times
they could have just solved the island problem like Berlin and split it between the two countries while letting the civilians roam freely trough them, instead they did it the american way
Drugs kicked in at the end there🤣🤣🤣
finally after 6 months
2:50 NAPOLEÓN?! HERE TOO?!
You Said mitle
Lmao that outro got me
That pig looks a lot like Waddles from Gravity Falls
Love how oversimplified also covers the wars we dont learn about in school
This just proves America wouldn't be what it is today without guns
6,9 mil views
ALASKA!!! ALASKA!!! Ya Gotta do "how was Alaska added to the USA" :D
18:15 oversimplified does a kermit impression.
@32:03 I think I have heard that , dialogue  in a movie.

"But the americans keep comeing and they dont stop comeing hoped in their wagons and Hit the ground running"
As perfect as always!
Lol, I actually live in Whatcom County.
Russian civil war  Where? We need it. We want it.
Oversimplified is truly an oversimplified guy. Even his plushie is oversimplified.
I would like to see a video about Yugoslavian war sometime cuz it may be pretty interesting considering it will be done by oversimplified.
Us war on canada le Putin: hold my vodka
Please, if you invade Canada, leave Quebec alone ;)
I love how much details are included in these animations, despite them appearing so simply.  Such has with the red line on General Scott's head after breaking down the down at 33:29
7:58 😂😂😂
The Nord VPN plug...  Well played.
The ending was American Asf
oversimplified make a series on pakistan vs india
Well I was expecting a Vietnam War video, but this is very interesting.
nowe way helll nahhhhe i love  canda
Pacific Northwest, Oregon and someone who loves a pig… YEAH LETS MAKE THIS INTO A DISNEY SHOW!
That was the best ending I've ever seen.
just for the Canada thing i'm disliking
The way guy does sponsorship is amazing
Meow
Can Honey work on Lazada and Shopee?  (likely chance no one will reply)
33:28
Bro the ending killed me lmao
the ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finally
I just love the fact that at 18:20 subtitles say "just a man in his potato", what was going on there back then, something weird in the air?
The ending for americans🌎 The ending for Canadians😂😓😔😬😨😖
The ending for americans🌎 The ending for Canadians😂😓😔😬😨😖
A minute in and "woah woah woah i didnt say they were white ppl" already made me choke on my food
I just love the outro!
Oh god the ending was beautiful
What about us Indians Stuart? Are we not loyal subscribers?
Biden is useless, but then so are most politicians. LOL
I didn't know oversimplified just rhymed a song
I had a feeling that oversimplified had uploaded some vid.. GG
murica!
can you  make a video about the spanish american war?
Africa??????
14:35 is one of my favorites.
would be funnier without your woke, anti-white crap.
You should do The Wall Street Crash
I love it that the British parliament is speaking with an American accent. 10:30
Hey pretty good video.Eould you please make the Greek Revolution and the greek war of independence (1821-1830) in your next video?

Ok

6.9 million views.noice
I remember this tale parent's told me.

Hi Oversimplified! I love your videos and I have a suggestion, it would be awesome of you if you could make an Oversimplified Korean war video! Keep it the vids up!🔥😀
I feel like you almost have to do a Canadian video with that ending lmao
7:58😳 Over simplified released ha remix for all stars
33:29
“Babe wake up oversimplified posted a new video”

31:00 : the better alladin and his genie
Finally a new video
7:57 - 8:06 was a masterpiece The all new all star
damn bro ur voice is maturing so much :')
The best history video ever! Hahahaha
29:16 my favorite part
This video is a goddamn JOURNEY
Next Video: Mexican-American War😊
So, I used to actually live on the street next to American camp on San Juan island, as in three or four houses down was the entrance. I used to walk my dog there every morning and walk through the actual camp, past the cabins that are still there, and up to the battery where the canons were. When you say that the camp is exposed, its true, there is absolutely nothing out there but open field between camp and the water. I was actually just out at American camp with my children a few months ago. English camp is also still on the island and is one of the few places where the US government will hoist the flag of another country without diplomatic status (according to wikipedia).
Can you do a video on the journey of Gustav Vasa or something i would like that. Ps Sweden has a pretty crazy past with wars and bickering and stuff and i think it would be pretty funny if you did a video on it
I love you
5:49
I love it when General Scott threw the chair at William Harney.
Three reasons why Oversimplified is entertaining:   1.Oversimplified makes history interesting and funny  2.Makes History accurate  3.Makes he's edits incredible
The screaming of the two star while general class whooped his ass was *chefs kiss* the funniest gd thing I’ve seen this week.
I appreciate that around 27:28 you did actually change a few pixels on the map.
oh
He is back for 6 months
The ending was gold, definitely what somebody is going to try to po.
Who came here to watch him sing all star? 7:57
I was wondering why he took so long making a video his video was so much fun to watch these edits exampled why  it took him so long
Not even Oversimplified is safe from bots.
YOU MUST DO AN OVERSIMPLIFIED ON THE RELIGIONS, THAT WOULD BE INSANE 🤌
I have heard quite the opposite about the Healthcare in Canada.
At the end, Johnny Haris and Vox be like: "How the US stole Canada"
4:00 - I LOLed. I LOLed hard.
That was the most brilliant thing I have seen in awhile.  Also I learned something about the San Juan islands.   Thanks for the laughs and the knowledge. :P
29:11go there bc its funny
Ok
Russia just chilling in the top left corner lol
Are those brown people slaves?
"BUCHANAN"
the last one is so funny
The screaming was so funny
Pki
The pig was so cute I was sad for like a second when it died
“these white people sure love beavers!” made me laugh out loud
I am hoping for Chinese civil war video @oversimlified! Love your content!
29:17 is just one of the best moments of this vid lol
Remember what happened last time America invaded Canada? we occupied the white house for like 2 months after nearly burning it to the ground and we just left after America conceded lol Canada has an unbeaten army lol
I feel like OverSimplify had a lot of fun recording lines and animating this episode in particular, its felt very different from the others.
I wish I had this in high school lol
Gotta Manifest that Destiny baby. LOL
A serious subject painted over with too much bull$hit.
I’m from Washington and I never learned about this. Wild.
Do the Mexican American war next
I'm Canadian. should I be worried?
Nice
I just wanna say for some reason listening to oversimplified is literally the only thing that can make me fall asleep so I feel like that plushie ad was targeted directly at me
7:56 - 8:03 Only legends will get the reference
The ending is awesome, but sadly NATO exists
This reminds me so much of John Wick
Once again, smooth as balls transition for that sponsor segment.
Wait where is technoblade😂😂
Well, we have plenty of toasters to be scared of if you shoot a duck. And that other important thing. You know the thing! Come on man!!
Fun fact that was glossed over in this video: the White House was not white before the war of 1812. It was gray, the color of the stone used to build it.  If memory serves, they just painted over the existing stone to keep the building.
What the heck is the pig war
I find this to be really disrespectful. and very one-sided.
Oversimplified-Knowledgable person telling history Also Oversimplified-Rezourzez
I am learning about this in my Social Studies class and it explained better then my teacher because all we do are bascullay play games like blooket and ginkit. Thanks for a better teacher than my SS teacher
Watch out Canadians 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Pretty sure canada can fend us off.
I'd love to see you making a Video about the scottish wars of independence
Yeeeey upload
3:33 florida be lookin sus
7:56 he be singing
did the negotiations with the sheep actually happened?
4:08 was so unexpected. That was the hardest I've laughed in a long time
THE ENDING WAS WORTH IT... .......................................THUMBS UP!!!!
cant believe that they had a war over me
I like how his name Oversimplified and his plushie overpriced
A 12min video..... ........... in 39 MINUTES!!!!! HALF THE VIDEO IS ALL TIME WASTING JOKES:(
38 minutes about these silly islands is what we got instead of Vietnam..? :(
This is the only war that technoblade didn't won
WELL THE CANADIAN COMMENTS CERTAINLY BACKFIRED
That segway was smooooth.
Biden is coming with a cane not vengeance he might take a nap to
7:57 why did he start singing all star lol
most people, "how did you get a A+ on world history", me:"oversmplified"
Damn, this video was up a notch from other, when it comes to chill vibes.... Unexpected, but relished... More such videos 👍
My fucking god this is a work of art
33:29 has got to be the most funniest thing in this video
Christmas came early :)
9:10 That "enhance frame" thingy seems familiar... Isn't that from an old Command & Conquer game?
7:57 All Star Reference
10:23
Then U my Friend Should Use NORD VPN!    WT  F!!????????///////
4:12 this is referring I think to the time the US military tried to exterminate the buffalo
33:15
Wow! This video is really awesome that it already takes 6.8 Million views in just a week and 1 day
*hes alive! Les gooo*
Yellowstone>Banff.
8:49
Great video. Learning while laughing 😃
Punic Wars please
Do you think you will ever do a video on the Vietnam War?
Seems like they wanted to engage US troops N West so the confederacy could take advantage and win. Ding dongs indeed
38:11
Would you post a video on vietnam war?
4:04 and 7:19 are my favorite parts
that “Americans keep coming, and they don’t stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running, it didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon when they outnumbered the Brits more than 6 to 1.” part…  THAT HIT ME HARD LIKE A TRUCK
The end made me sad...
Imagine if the US was inspired by this video to actually go invade Canada
Ok, i'm at the 30-minute mark and only now i'm saying to myself: "Wait... all this tomfoolery actually happened?"
Was that waddles from gravity falls in a robe 😭
I find it very suspicious that at 5:30, the right side guy has this darker shade of something green in front of him... Looks like it's covering something <.<
1:24 Ok, I'm subbing.
is it normal you posting 3 videos a year?
THE PLUSHIE IS IN THE JAR!
was so excited about seeing the new oversimplified my hand was shaking and i accidentally clicked the wrong video three times in a row!!!
In 2:58 you can see a map of Indochina
What was is the song's name when American came to fort Vancouver I want to know someone pls tell me
This ending enraged the Canadians, who apologized to him severely
Every new video this guy uploads is better than the last.
I’m convinced, it’s war with  Canada!  Lol
And just like that, the islands were doomed to have a nonsensical date format for ever 🤯
Is it just me who thinks the old videos are much more hilarious? I remember I laughed so hard at oversimplified videos but not the new ones. But I still really appreciate the history lesson though. Definitely a great way to learn history!
Any one else think that Oversimplified has lost it?
3:34 I can’t tell if oversimplified put the legs their on purpose or it was an accident, but Florida looks like… something
3:34 Florida is in a very cursed spot
33:29 i just joined and i had no fucking idea what did i just missed. Great timing to me.
everytime this man goes off the radar, he comes back with something 6 times better than his last installment. Just true dedication and evolution of his voice acting and animation👏👏👏 Edit: scratch 6 times, 20 times is more like it!!
Please make a vietnam war video
"like rats! Or disease!"
"I dIdN't SaY tHeY wErE wHiTe PeOpLe"- Oversimplified
31:02 omfg I laughed so hard
ay hes bacc
This video was produced with your very own movement in your mouths.. every word twisted misleading propaganda ..🔥🔥🔥disgusting..
Make a vid about the war in 1812 us vs Britain
The Americans wanted to take all of North America's land, but the Canadians would have Nunavut.
Excellent as always. Very much enjoyed
You can't let the United states take over canada! You may be overpowered but if you are gonna cause more devastation than unity and you won't have the maple syrup if you nuked canada.
Perhaps it would de-OverSimplified the story but the side story about how one of the soldiers stationed in the US garrison was named Roberts. This man went on to study parliamentary process. So now we have "Roberts rules of order, for how discussions take place between separate parties.
That ending was better than the entire video. And I’m Canadian.
pepople is complaining abut talk is countris mind while latinoamerica :v
Return of the King
How does his content get better with every video
28:44 29:18 29:12 33:29
Interestingly, the Indian Mutiny had just occurred prior to the Pig War... If the Empire hadn't nearly lost India, maybe some pointless islands on the far side of the planet would have been worth fighting over.
Next video should be about the Mexican American war, want to see some México!
I got the plush
This isn't about the cops?
Everybody remember that God is with you and that you should spread the word that it is never too late to change your life for the better.
Yet again the best content on the Internet
This is hands down the best episode you’ve done by far!!
7:57 my man singing all star
I would love if you can do a oversimplification video of the Japanese Sengoku Jidai during Early, Mid to Late 16th Century.
31:04 Please god let that be Morgan Freeman voice acting as the pig 🤣
he should do the mexican war
I want more of Morgan Freeman pig
14:28 - Numbers didn't dissapoint me.
3:34 Florida is Americas pp
I wish this man was the US secretary of education and did a piece on that h o b a g Betsy Devos in the name of reclaiming American education from the ppl that think Lauren Boebert, Ted Cruz, and Marjorie Taylor Greene are legit politicians. O wait, I think watched the remix on the hub the other day.
32:30 Am i the only one who gets the joke?
That last bit of the video killed me.
now i wanna know what canadian bacon is made out of....
man you're simply awesome :D
definitely augmented the experience watching this when i can see san juan island from my bedroom window
38:11 Presidential sex
And The next episode will be Crimean War ? Want to see fight between biggest country and 2 empires
You need to upload more often .. we miss you !!!
Middle channel I believe.
Good seeing a different view on this. I grew up in the area and this paints the Americans in a way worse way than I was taught.
2:35
It’s so big
Oversimplified: The Roman Empire  Like for yes, dislike for no
You should do a video about the Seven years war, That would be a real interesting video
7:57 But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming Hopped in there wagons and hit the ground running  It didn't make since to keep sharing Oregon  When they out numbered the Brits, More then Six to One
Oversimplified completely lost it in the ending though
When you wake up and choose violence
The Morgan Freeman voice had me
Canada would have been known as American territory today.
Bro a really if USA invaded Canada he would be cut out of all alliances and would be an easy target for China and Russia, also Canadian troops are trained to fight like guerilla,Wich is the weak spot of America. Never thought you would say something so dumb
Please do Mexican American war
Future Canadian historians shall condemn us for not assassinating oversimplified
nope never
Did my guy just copy the command and conquer zoom sequence? 😂😂
So that's how it is, uh? That's how it's going to be, is it? That's the way in which things are, eh? That be how it will, is it? Will it be how that is, huh? That be the way in which things be the way they are, is it?
you can take our land, you can have Wayne Gretzky, you can even have our freedom, you may take Banff BUT MARK MY WORDS BBQ BOY YOU WILL NEVER AMERICANIZE OUR MAPLE SYRUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!
As a Canadian, im terrified
San Juan Island's Pickett being the eponymous general for Pickett's Charge is the greatest plot twist in this entire video
Yeah ... biden can try to invade canada. That will leave canada with another 85Billions worth of military supply  when he shit his pants  figuratively and literally then leave XD Lets go Brandon!
Bruh I can't belive mexico lost half of its territory
I would like to think Oversimplified is actually a US diplomat with a lot of power, and is just telling us what the US is planning to do
You should do the Balkan Wars!
and finally is 33:30 after disgussin whois an idiot then its lucha libre  Pickett:oof Gen. Hunt:WTH Harney:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Scott:WHAT DID I TELL YOU DUMMIE
7:58-8:04 Anyone recognize that?
3:42 Happy Coronavirus
then there is the 27:17 when its a telenovela The Brits.:BUCHANAN!!!!!!!!! Buchanan:PANIK
Goddamn I love this channel. Always a treat to watch your videos.
26:04 why anime face anime lovers:HE JOINED US Pickett:PANIK
I have to admit, I think that this is the best OverSimplified video on the channel, in my opinion of course. I just love how funny everything is, like how everyone is really dumb and only a few people are not. That is why I liked this part: 30:27 - 33:35 I also liked the fake flashbacks. It was pretty funny watching a pig stand up like a human and in the next turn into a (mobster I think?). All in all, this is my all-time favorite video from OverSimplified. =)
U need to make a video about the history between israel and plastan
What is wrong with Canada?
Can u pls do the six day war or the israeli independens war they are very intresting as part of the small wars
There is no way that the US could possibly justify invading Canada. At least not at this point in time.
That ending was hilarious.
12:04 I love how he gave it Waddle's face from gravity falls
Finally video, after 6 months
1812 War USA : lets attack Canada Canada push back and burn the white house for shit and giggles then go back home for a beer USA : Lets call it a draw ok?
Let's go Brandon
😭that ending👏👏👏
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAA THAT WAS AWESOME
This is probably a humor based video and I love it so much
I'm using the go suck an egg from now on
I actually spent some time on San Juan Island and saw all the historical sites associated with the Pig War. This video does a fantastic job of explaining everything!
7:07 what song
7:58 *Wow, just wow*
Lmao.... when the u.s. expanded Florida was the dick
Since the next one is probably going to be a two-parter, can I ask: Could you please make something to do with Franco or The Spanish Civil War? It would be really helpful since I’m studying those at school at the moment and I would like the help…
Hey do you have a video planned covering the Mexican American War? I think it would be a super interesting video
As a friend to one of Pickett's descendents, I can assure you the stupid has bred true through the generations...the fact that he's a history major focusing on this period of US history just makes it that much more hilarious.
12:24 Does anyone else play kerbal space program?
14:36
I’m related to Milard Filmore put him in a video!
14:35 me at my essays
The only thing Biden's coming with is Dementia and a full diaper. You're Safe Canada....for now...
I would really want to see an Oversimplified-video about the Chinese Civil War/Revolution, through I guess that could potentially be a too controversial subject.
FINALY
Canada: "So, you're not invading?"     America: "Of Course not.  We would never invade you.  unless you gave us a reason to."
*reverse racism*
GG to Spain for putting up with all this
I like how this video is longer than the one on American Civil War xD
The whole time I watched this video I kept saying "This Pickett guy really is a 'hot-headed buffoon" and at 34:51 it all made sense
Finally………an upload
Finallyyyy I’ve been waiting for a new video could you do one on the Jacobite rebellions
33:23 lol
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
The end kinda sounded like a future idea for an EAS Scenario. I think it should be called “EAS Scenario: The Canadian-American War”
0:50 This hurts
How did General Harney remain a general after being court-martialled 4 times? Not to mention his **reputation**.
Us brits will get our revenge...
honestly would mind us invading canada just probably wont since were on good terms but all that land would be amazing for the  country
I’m not sure if you have but you should do a video on the Alamo next
7:57
My personal head canon is that the pig and the potato were having an affair. And the two men blamed one another. And the whole issue was the pig and the potato playing dumb humans off of each other so they don’t get discovered.
Are you able to do the Honduran Revolution?
The most unintentionally funny part of the whole video was the Biden bit, especially since it was released the same day as the Biden-Putin new Munich conference happend.
LOL face is now a "NO" face?
That ending was so personal lmao!!
I just want to say that was the best segway to an advertisement I've ever seen.  If I didn't already have a subscription, I would have signed up just for that.
God bless America
Day 1 of asking for the south african border war
Oh no.. we need to wait another 6 months.
Loved the All-Star remix hahaha
why do i hear all star at 7:51
And I could make a video about Lithuania.
Getting nowhere on offense and getting your main government's building burnt. Don't sound like being equal, more like "here is your ass, I like me boot back when you get it out of it!" IDK
i'M sO sCaReD oF aMeRiCa
Imagine being Canadian am I right.
15:00 where i left off
I just watch a 38:43 video and you didn't mention Canada once :p
13:05 Absolutely love it! Caught me off guard and I just burst out with a laugh in the middle of nowhere. 11/10 creativity as expected from you. Amazing video as always!
I'm quite fond of a nice beaver myself
Or the Brits would have completely crushed the Americans on sea and landed more professionel troops and taken over huge parts of the US while the civil war was going on.
You rickrolled me in the best way possible
Please subtitle in Portuguese 😢🙏
This might be the only history lesson kids get these days. So, you have to be more careful to be unbiased.  Conveniently left out: The US was the world's only democracy and our very existence threatened every other country's government.   The native population in 1800 was 16 per 100 square miles The settlers were incredibly poor people escaping east coast ghettos or European despots.
Ey lad can you make a video on the Irish War of Independence   Thanks from Leinster 🇮🇪
7:57
Being a history professor I love these!! And the Canada rant at the end is priceless!
It took me a whole week to realize the thumbnail was a star wars reference
Can you make your face reveal when you got 6 million subscriber
Those last 2 minutes were spot on
can anyone the song that plays in 16:28
oversimplified war on terror?
How is this free to watch
you're legendary sir
"Technoblade was not harmed while making of this video".
"I hear voices all the time" lol
Please make the next one the about the vietnam war
Bitte the Nordic wars next!
Dont make us burn the white house again
Love your content! You think we can get the opium wars I want to learn about DRUGS
Poland: smirks in Chicken War
India you forget
you should make a video about what happend in congo
But the Americans keep coming and they dont stop coming hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running
He’s back
Jesus give Brandon no stupid ideas mate
14:22 REVERSE CARD!
Invading Canada? Im in! THEY HAD IT TOO GOOD FOR TOO LONG!
I'm sorry but this is by far Oversimplified worst video. Its about some irrelevant islands which neither governments didnt care too much about.
I have finished what he has started   Somebody once told me the san juan would roll me I ain't the sharpest musket in the shed That pig was looking dumb with her snout and her slum so I shot her in the forehead  Well the americans start coming and they don't stop coming Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running Didn't make sense to keep sharing oregon with the brits when we outnumbered them 6 to1  The brits get smart but Harney gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the buffalo meat? You'll never know if you don't go  You'll never trade if you don't grow  Hey now, you're a pioneer, get your game on, go blaze Hey now, you're a settler, get the show on, get paid For god, glory, and gold Only 49’ers break the mold It's a cold trail and they say it gets colder You're armed up now, wait 'til the americans get bolder But the Britians beg to differ Judging by the navy in the river   The Harney’s plan won’t win So General scott patience is getting thin  My pig is dead, how about yours? I’ll arrest Cutlar, and I hate these tours  Hey now, you're a pioneer, get your game on, go blaze Hey now, you're a settler, get the show on, get paid For god, glory, and gold Only 49’ers break the mold Hey now, you're a pioneer, get your game on, go blaze Hey now, you're a settler, get the show on, get paid For god, glory, and gold Only 49’ers  Somebody once asked if i could manifest my destiny  I need to get myself away from this place I said,” If god approves” I could use a little land myself And we could all use a little change  Well the americans start coming and they don't stop coming Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running Didn't make sense to keep sharing oregon with the brits when we outnumbered them 6 to1  The brits get smart but Harney gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the buffalo meat? You'll never know if you don't go  You'll never trade if you don't grow  Hey now, you're a pioneer, get your game on, go blaze Hey now, you're a settler, get the show on, get paid For god, glory, and gold Only 49’ers break the mold For god, glory, and gold Only 49’ers break the mold
what are the sources for this?
3:35 *their right in caption haha
3:35 *their right in caption haha
the funniest so far lmao
Can you do subcontinent of India’s next
America 100
a fantastic video OverSimplified. Love your videos these should be used to get people to learn about historical events, but you know in a fun comedic way!
He nails the personality of Americans not going to lie....I'm one of them
yall got no balls to start a war with Canada
Vietnam war please sir
I need a plushie of that pig
27:27
lmaooo the ending🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ending is the greatest thing on YouTube!  But what I wonder is how these people during this time would have reacted to the U.S. and the U.K. becoming each other's greatest allies..
The last part had a real nice smell of that old American jingoism
Vietnam war next?
33:00 lol
7:55 the best part
We learn how big bullies can only start a war with weaker nations but among themselves they won't. Their "levelheadedness" only appears when they see real power before them. Like in the case of North Korea, China or Russia. Their force is only for the weakest like Vietnam, like Afghanistan, like Iraq or Syria. We are still living in a shadow colonialism where human rights and freedom is only available for the puppets of the few big bullies.
This sounds.....awfuly familiar.....*starts to have a panic attack in argentinian*
Imagine if all history classes were like that 🤷🏾‍♀️ why not school system
HEY DUDE I WANT YOU TO DO NOT. NOT. NOT SLACK OFF AND MAKE MORE VIDEOS SO I DO NOT NEED TO WATCH YOUR PREVIOUS VIDEOS( THAT I LITEALLY WATCHED MORE THAN 100'S OF TIMES )TO MINE SOME DOPAMINE FROM MY BRAIN...
Do the Vietnam War, pls?
Can you please do Queen Victoria or/and Queen Elizabeth II? 🥺
Lol that ending
This gives war pigs, a whole new meaning
7:57 Damn.. Oversimplified got some lit bars
37:16 first time ive seen OverSimplified go chaotic
Hold on if it was widely known that Pickett was this dumb then how come Lee gets all the rap over Pickett getting mown down.
7:57 COOMMIN RUNNIN OREGONE ONE
Poor piggy
6:35 *everybody looks at Israel for banning it*
I love you man, just for this (37:10) and not only this type of content. Good to have you back, keep up the amazing work!
What a FINALE   OH MY  DUCKING GOOOSH
Wtf?
hope that any Canadian doesn't report this video
24:02 AMOGUS SUS???!!??!!?!?!
I hope Biden and Justin Trudeau don't surf internet much(particularly youtube)
Holy shit. Fuck the US.
silliest way to start a war ,Americans : pigs                                                                                                                                                  ran out of options? Americans : an internet vedio
36:57 - 38:42 I'm sure that this is the funniest part of the whole video. I laughed so hard my mom thought I was crazy.
At 3:37 I can't tell if the misspelling of Destiny was a genuine mistake, or a fat joke directed towards America but I love it either way.
dude should just make a cartoon or anime series already!
I have a video idea: 2020 oversimplified
you could’ve just said the ukrainian war
poor pig.
@oversimplified if you don’t get your shit together and make more content more often you’ll Need to make a simple history on the genocide I’ll commit
31:48 finally some walking animation
You are getting better every time!! hahaaha
3:36 it's my density
You should do a video about the spanish civil war
2:54 map of vietnam on yhe table is taunting. Please do Vietnam War if you could.
Too bad this was uploaded on December 7th. We could've had Vietnam War for Christmas and uploaded exactly on December 25th.
plz upload more
4:10    call of duty lobbys nowadays
THE KING IS BAAACCKKKK BIIITTTCCC
7:57 Lol.
please make videos more often
Enough of US and Europe videos! Make a video about Southeast Asia!
He is back
The ending was the best thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂 As an American, if I woke up tomorrow and the news said the US was invading Canada, I wouldn’t be very surprised. I feel we’d lose over some dumb mistake lol
Hey man can you make the filipino revolution man
we need a episode on the entire history of rome
Pls make a video about Indian history since it is the most invaded place on earth
Ha
Please make a video of the seven years war
you would still loose against canada in one section wildlife they have the moose
7:37 *cue Independence from TTO the musical*
The war about a pig and potatoes...The Potato War?
34:12 when 1 officer from each came is doing the worm, that was hilarious haha.
i hear voices all the time
the end almost looked like an internet historian video
Pig War makes me think you should do a Hatfield and McCoys Oversimplified video.
5:55 press this to believe in humanity....
Can you do Cross wars oversmplefied
7:57
If only my history class were entertaining as this video, I would still remember all my lessons up to now.
3:31 so you are sauing if an american eats a burger it grows a weiner?
That assumption that we're all American is the most American thing.
Could you do New Zealand Maori war
please do vietnam next
7:57 just a very specific *all star* reference
That was PHENOMENAL.
Love the ending hahahahaha
How does this video get more likes than the other video 6 months ago... I guess this is now going to be your most popular video in about a month Plus keep up the good work oversimplified:)
Canada?  He must mean Northern Montana.
this seems very anti american, and it also sounds like someone is butthurt over how much better at war we are.
I appreciate Oversimplified recognizing that, if America annexed Canada, the best parts of America would just become the Canadian parts.
The ending was hilarious 😂 though I would rather die as a Canadian than become an American. HAHAHA
What about poland???
if you spare my life ( with morgan freeman voice ) hhahahaha
You made my entire study semester with the last part. I'm canadian. I laughed really hard. I got scared really hard too.😂
Funny enough, I heard a conspiracy theory that Biden's first phone call to Trudeau was really an ultimatum. That Trudeau clean up Canada's house, specifically the prairie provinces, or Biden's administration will do it for him.
Lo
31:15 This sounds like a Dhar Mann scene to me
I think the funniest part is this isn't even the worst thing Pickett is known for. Seeing as yknow. Pickett's Charge is a thing
Sadhguru,
With our cunning ideas and inventions, you all be be witted when we take Alaska and Oregon, after all, Alaska is out of gold, Oregon is out of trees. why bother holding onto useless land.
Can you please do a gold rush video
The end made me patriotic for a country I’m not even in
This is the best video yet. Well done. The manifest destiny bit at the end had me crying!
Alternative history! Britain: The islands are mine! America: (with more pizzazz) the islands are ours! Germany: The verdict is in, the islands belong to...       DER DEUTSCHES REICH!!!
This man had way too much fun doing the ending of this vid
So, firstly, you got the ENTIRE settlement phase just... wrong. The native tribes weren't noble savages living in perfect harmony with nature, but a thousand different bands of highly aggressive, independent warrior-societies that raided, attacked, enslaved, and massacred each other, just as much as they did whites that encroached on their lands. Look into the Commanche - their name literally means "the enemy" or "rapist" in the language of their rival tribes for VERY good reasons.  Adding on to that, there was no single great unified surge west. Rather, it was a process that occurred over a huge amount of time, often in spurts and trickles, and was more like the ebb of the flow of the tide than some grand, racially motivated occupation.  On top of that - the one thing you got right was that, yes, it did take American settlers to develop the western territories. The French had only minimally developed some parts of their holdings, largely along the Mississippi river, and there were no urban centers north of mexico and west of the river by that time. The Mississippi cheifdoms were long since destroyed, largely by flu and tuberculosis, and hadn't even really come into contact with Europeans and ends in the mid-late 16th century.  Generally speaking, not only was this a gross misrepresentation of the time period, but also incredibly racist and just plain wrong.
15:10 "Being American, they pulled out guns on him and he had to back down."
I think every video here is always of utter quality and incredibly educational. But this one- the ending- chef’s kiss to you sir!
22:16 It gone thru the Panama Canal.... at 1859?!
God I love this channel.
BUCHANNAN...
You outta do the stupidest conflict, the Honey War.
Amazing video as always
make vietnam war
I like how chaotic the ending became.
Indian War of Independence? Please.
I learned about the San Juan islands and the OS doesn't like America.
Not many people know that Harney is a direct ancestor of the Trump family.
Watching for the 10th time...
Indians: How the hell did we find Gold in Canada?
finally a political movement I can get behind
Is it me or has his voice not changed in 5 years lmao
I think New Zealand is the least spoken about country
Wow okay that was worth a watch to the end.
Jesus he really put the most effort into his voice out of his channel in this one video
Hey oversimplified can u do a video on Iran’s Islamic revolution or about the big Monarch party the Iranian royal family throw before being taken down? Trust me it’s hella interesting
I like how high oversimplify. At the end there it's refreshing
WHAT?!? OH NO! THAT MEANS WE CANT EXPAND! I HATE MY LI-  wow wow wow, I never said they were white people.
Your anti-American imperialism slant is offensive. Conquest has been a constant throughout world history, including the Amerindians. The rest of the video was nice though
Thank you
5:51 I already knew that the british guy will offer NordVPN lmaooooo
Please one day do the boxer rebellion
this scene of 33:29 makes me laugh
Me 38 minutes ago: what is the pig war? Me 38 minutes later: TO WAARRR!!!!
Great video man!!!!!........ I request you to make an oversimplified colonial period of British in India till freedom....PLEASEE!!!!!!
Fact is we were fools for not taking Canada when we had the chance. Now a bunch of commies control the most important trade route.
Oh dear God it's the bucket War all over again
Bring on the war I will defend my home more men don't mean nothing when you know how to strategize
Can you do a video on the Michigan-Ohio War? Interesting part of development for the US. Also maybe the Honey War.
People nearly starting a war about a pig and potatoes. Is this the dumbest thing ever in history?
Can you make a video of the Spanish Empire? (pohr-fah-bohr)
15:59 GUYS oversimplified teased The vietnam war, look to the left on the table!
My fellow Americans  Let this be known as the continuation of our destiny and patriotism set by god and our founding fathers respectively  We shall make maple syrup snow cones ten years from now
6:10 Dementia is so heartbreaking
the fact that i had a test about this same topic the day this video came out
Finally a new upload
Floridong
Straight line?
no bidens "cumming" for them XD
If the states try to invade us itll be the second vietnam. I would personally become a suicide bomber if nessicary.
Ok I have some suggestions. Maybe doing the Seven years war or possibly Vietnam war. Or like a mega episode on like Cold War proxy wars?
7:57 this be jammin
The only war injury recorded during this conflict was one British soldier that had a rock thrown at his eye from an American trench
I'm just going to take a guess and say that the administrator of this channel is about 90% probably gay. Spent a lot of time talking about territorial dispute that he believes started over a pig. Yeah really? I'm pretty sure the territorial dispute started over a territorial dispute. But never mind that. The problem with oversimplifying history is that well when you oversimplify anything you missed the point entirely. And considering the fact that James Buchanan used to be as far as presidents were ranked was by the Numbers the worst president in US history. Not even Carter or Obama could compete with him for that title. And now we have Biden who is even worse than Buchanan and he's talking about invading Canada? Yeah I know it's most likely a joke regardless of the fact that yes the us could conquer Canada in a matter of weeks but we don't need to, even if we wanted to we do not have a president that could command the military even in that simple of a war. In fact the Canadians might actually win with that idiot in charge. So basically I put together that this person is gay, likes myths and legends and mistakes them for history, apparently really like Canadians and their way of life, and really likes Biden. Yeah not someone that anyone should be listening to. But on a positive note that was very entertaining. I would like to see more oversimplified cartoons on Disney channel
You should do a video on the English civil war
Technobladeeeee
PLS DO THE CRUSADES!
Oh man this was the best video yet. I never knew about the Pig War and the ending made me nearly die from laughter!
as a Washington I wish the canadian US border followed the columbia
This is absolute brilliance
You know, I’m less worried about Biden actually declaring war than I am of him falling asleep on the declare war button
The next video should be about the Spanish silver war and where do u go in momths
OMG I’M GONNA SUFFOCATE FROM LAUGHING SO HARD
PART 2 PART 2
Just more proof god is a joke and a made up fairy tale
Coz I am half Indian, I would suggest that you make something on Indian History
Our legend is back bois
I like your new animation styles like the cowboys shooting wildly in san juan island.
Amazing video but will the Vietnam war ever come out?
It's so hard to wait for these but they never disappoint, absolutely fantastic work!
LOLZ
"who talked to God!"  "it was Billy!"  "Harold!"  "well it was one of us. Not like we made it up to justify our ruthless imperialism"   Lmao
7:57 - 8:03   Is it just me or It sounded like all-star?
He returns!!!!! Yaaaayy
Little fun fact I am related to Henry Hudson
Canada in 2021: Ah, our nice, beautiful country! Nothing can go wrong! 😊  2022: * U.S.A. annexes Canada and instills brutal military occupation like they did in the Fallout Franchise *  Canada in 2022: 😱  I hope this isn't offensive....
14:29 I see what you did there
Dicks out for Spuddy
how a pig indirectly caused the invasion of Canada
Fun fact. Pickett. Is Welsh.  Just look at the ett in his surname. Not only that. He's Cambro-Norman. Or in other words. Norman-Welsh.
Genuinely sad at the pig
Please 🙏🙏 next about Indo-Pak war for the liberation of Bangladesh
YOU ARE THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD OVERSIMPLIFIED I AM A BIG FAN
Didn't know people could advocate for open war
33:24 good part
is that kerbal space program music im hearing?
The Americains keep coming and they dont stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running.  Damn you are truly halarious XD.
Did I just witness a G-rated version of the quitting scene from Half Baked?
Hey Arnold lol episode
zamn
his videos are so funny and are the best
USA USA USA USA LETS GO TAKE CANADA LESSS GOOOOOOOOOO
I know that it is not a war, but could you do the Battle of Bannockburn. It is an impressive one that would be greatly presented if you were the YouTuber to make a video on it.
when are you gonna make one on Mesopotamia?
Bruh what was that ending I just watched, he went off haha
37:08 - 38:19  Mommy I’m scared
He’s back!
funni peppa war 🐖
moral of the story- own guns
You should do the life of stolin
THE KING HAS RETURNED
This man needs a Nobel peace prize
The usa would be so proud of you 37:15
Wow.. you outdid yourself here.
why did you just turn on canada at the end bro? LOL
32:31 Winfield Scott: I've made up my mind. 2 seconds later... Winfield Scott: Calls everyone idiots.
that was the greatest outro I have ever seen
I like this invasion of Canada Hahaa
This was horrifyingly hilarious as whole🤣💀 But in all honesty even tho America _could_ invade Canada, they won't do it. (Said by an American)
Something on Vietnam
Make a history video about Indonesia Independence War!!!
18:17 Why dose the potato have sonics shoes? Did the spud steal them from sonics horrible human like feet?
idk if you saw this but if u look at the image above the title, I think it's a reference to star wars.
LOL
I know where I'm going for vacation after the Covid pandemic officially ends.  ... The general location where this war almost started. XD
Can you please do an oversimplified War Of The Worlds please?
Its been a while... Hehe
You should do the Spanish-American War.
You guys really want us to burn your white hoouse again eh?
You guys had me DEAD with General Scott hiding behind the door!!!  Straight line?  Straight line.
US: Invades Canada again  Brits: *Sigh*
Who says these videos have to be based on real events? Star Wars oversimplified?
Imma mark my favorite parts: 30:47  to be continued...
35:48 I love the attention to detail. The Ottoman Empire still controls most of the Balkans, Italy is unified except the Papl States, Norway and Sweeden are still one country. So cool
do a vid about chinese civil war
ITS MY DENSITY!!
Fun Fact: My family believes that the guy running Oversimplified is a Canadian, even after the rant.  Edit: Huh. I expected to get some comments and some likes, but THIS many?  "I did not see that coming."
0:01 looking at timed comments I see
Let's Go Brandon!
7:58 only legends realized ovrsimplified sings all star
Alright boys, all these Canadians are talking trash by mocking us with things like (The U.S would win). Lets show them boys invade!
You should do the opium wars. Or the sepoy rebellion
Oversimplified do a war of 1812 video
Neat analysis video! Thanks for uploading!
3:53 “I think it was Sherman’s cat”
finally!
7:58 OverSimplified sings All Star.
Please upload a little more Ik they take time but ur so good ik people say quality over quantity I agree but maybe ever month make a vid
Amazing man, best vids on YouTube
As an american I can confirm we do carry a  McDonald's on our back when colonizing.   Its just an american thing. You wouldn't understand.
Poor Spuddy, got eaten and nobody ever even apologized :'(
Even with our superior power the US would fail an invasion due to Biden being in office.
What is the Star Spangled Banner song near the end?
That advertisement was so good started
I have had this in my recommendations since it came out, and everytime I've seen it, I think its a video about THE SONG 'War pigs' by Sabbath. This is fun too.
If we invade Canada we will be the 2nd largest country
The only channel that makes advertising fun to watch 😂 I died when the US guy was like wtf...
Are you planning to make a video about The 7 Years War?
7:56 Shrek meme right there
1812 was a Draw? Okay that is funny It was a decisive defeat for the US. The British are fighting the French in Europe and the US can't defeat a garrison force. They can't achieve nothing without the French lmao
Manifest Destiny was fucking great
That outtro was amazing.
I watched this today on my birthday thanks for the gift of laughter my friend
That ending 😳
Turtles
Yo how did you get Morgan Freeman to voice the pig!?
"Whoa whoa whoa, i didn't say they were white people "😂😂
Me: "What I like is History and Comedy..." OverSimplified: "Say no more"
i absoulutely love the new kind of humor, and the amazing quality, this is my favorite channel on youtbube
Will you ever do more miniwars episodes?
Wow, why did it take 6 days for this to be recommended to me, Youtube?! Anyway, liking & commenting before I watch this in full! Might comment more later! Thanks for uploading!
my man this is boring
george is kinda thick
May I make a suggestion? The Scottish war of independence
You should do the 30 years/league war next.
@Netflix, get this man his own history cartoon show w all the resources he needs
Vietnam War?
Who said learning can’t be fun 😂
That pig has the best voice
Ah yes, the San Juan Islands battle over a single pig. Got to love some of the silliness of my state.
7:57
5:56 is the best part
I love how you make fun of humanity's tendencies to actually say the correct plan, but then do the complete opposite.
4:04 7:57 7:11 16:02
Im back for my third time watching this why am i addicted to this video
0:46 Racist, accurate for the time.
When are we seeing a video for the Wild West?
Well I can certainly tell he had fun with the last 2 minutes of this video lmao.
British troops removed the flag. Yep that sounds right. Very British. Jolie good 😂😂😂
Oversimplified  got it wrong again,  They Ussually  screw up u.s. history,  only stating bad things ignoring all the good things. A little less government  politically preferable history,  and a little more historical  accuracy  please
Agree with the ending. Let's go!
This is one of the best episodes ever!!!
This is the only reason why i'm still living.
For your next video, may i recommend the decembrist revolt?
7:58 dam that rhymes
Griffin just needed to shoot spuddy with his gun and all this conflict could have been averted.
Oversimplified making videos about US-Mexican War  Oversimplified: Could US continue to invade Mexico ? Think about it, WHY NOT ?   Mexican viewers : ohh sh*t here we go again
37:18  USA: let's invade canada!! UN: really? That's a bad idea. USA: manifest destiny? UN: you know that was a stupid idea right? USA: manifest destinyyy. UN: don't try it, it's a bad idea, we mean it. *One USA's ass kicke'd later* USA: bad idea, it was a bad idea.
Holy crap that ending...lol
Tuesday the 7 December: Oversimplified releases this video and people rumor about an American invasion of Canada Tuesday the 14 h 07:15 pm Pres. Joe Biden denies that US is going to invade Canada. Tuesday the 14 h 07:16 pm Us forces invade Canada following the operation Oversimplified.
what the hell happened at the end? Did the narrator swallow 6-pack of red bull?
Length of videos discussing World War Two, the biggest war in history involving almost every major power on earth and forever altering global relations and society - 29 mins. 20 sec. Length of video discussing the Pig War, a completely unnecessary and drawn out feud between two dudes on some island in the Pacific Northwest with absolutely no impact on society - 38 mins. 43 secs.  I can't tell you how much I love this, keep up the good work my guy!
Gotta say the ending to this video is by far my favorite ending of any of the videos  Bucket scene still surpasses though, can’t beat that stuff
See you in 6 months 😔
my mouth was watering for the manifest destiny on Canada
Your oversimplification  amounts to misrecital of US history. Childish teachers should not teach.
10/10
Can I use NordVPN on my Samsung smart fridge
was i the only one who tought of technoblade?
Is it just me, or does the pig look like waddles from gravity falls?
Is it me or has his voice changed?
7:52 little rap
12 weeks to correspond with your troops...... LoL today you can start and end several wars in that amount of time
Okay okay.,. and what about FRENCH canada ?
You should cover the balkan war any of them
YESSSSS
i laughed and learnd good job my man
Try the hard topic of British and US colonialism.
18:34
7:58 is it intentional that its referencing all star?
The last minute and a half was art, God bless America and Canada y’all 🇺🇸 🇨🇦
{37:00} Honestly I thought this was a sponsor...
Who was in Paris?
Oversimplified Crimean War pls?
This is a god-like meme template 33:29
That ending was fantastic.  I feel like you had some pent up anger in you and finally let it all out.
Canada burned down the white house, NOT the British. That's just bullshit the British try to take claim to while the states try to keep in their subjective textbooks. And with the ending like that, a few jtf2 can make it happen again while the don't say sorry to the people they trained and have to kill, because they are trained to be emotionless maple syrup drinking killers. Lol
That was epic
this guy never disappoints me. top quality video as usual
"You guys are fine"
You had me until the whole "Biden is coming with a vengeance" it's more of a "Biden is shitting himself." 🤣 I do wish i could give hearts instead of "Likes" to a video.
If America did take over Canada there is one thing they would have no idea how to deal with. The issue of the cobra chick also known as the Canadian geese.
Best videos ever but plz make videos frequently
patriotic tears were shed at the ending. *cries in bald eagle*
I was just thinking has anyone watched “Canadian Bacon” with John Candy and Alan Alda? I just can’t help but think the Pig war inspired the movie.
And to think this could all have been solved in a simple way.  🪨 📃 ✂️
I mean Biden is old enough to remember the Pig War as a hot topic as a child.
4:04 this had me dying XD
#14 on trending
7:57 I need the full song oversimplified
i find the ending a little too... american?
The greed of the west has shackled the soul of this planet.
5:13 rip I’m now Canadian😪
Manifest destiny is based.
By far the best OverSimplified video you've ever produced Mr. Webster!  Out-fucking-standing!  Well done, well done indeed!  Can't wait for the next one!
From where Oversimplified started with WWI to now, the quality and skill  is always improving. Bravo!
When is the Vietnam videos coming out?
i will personally plant a tree on ur house
good video
*Canada proceeds to kick america's ass with the power of the maple syrup floods, and then the syrup proceeds to become sentient and form a protective barrier to defend from nuclear warheads until the US surrenders* Lol imagine that scenario
i hope he does a video about chernoby
It’s so satisfying to see Winfield Scott beat up Harney
32:30 Will be part of a Oversimplified but it's out of context video. PREDICTION
33:29 Will be part of a Oversimplified but it's out of context video. PREDICTION
This only reminded me that wars were fought over imaginary lines
Bruh this mans just suddly rapped im gone XD
Lets invade Canada today
HAHAHA!!!!
TF2 soldier would be proud at that ending
Hey your back....... what great knowledge do you have for us? Can you fo a Vietnam one?
This should've been named "the beevers war"
ахуенно)
I'm bothered by the fact that he pulled an AK-47 since he's American 16:03
5:21 казалось бы, причём здесь Украина
The bit about the American civil war is weird as Britain and stopped there part of the slave trade in 1807 led by William Wilberforce
That pig reminds me of gravity falls so much!!
Manifest Destiny take over North America
aah the biden jokes these days XD
Can you do a video about the Black and Tans?
These videos never get boring plus I learn things that I actually didn't in school
As an English man, of all the wars we've lost, this one stings the most
I heard shrek reference but ok.
Did anyone know president baiden  account name 😂
"Mole Mole Mole Mole"! that had me in tears! lol Your videos are always great brother. Keep up the good work!
Hey,could you make a video on the indian independence and the wars related to it,it would be interesting
Your videos are so good, dude... I almost achieve a half-chub the second you start talking 😁
31:02

Racist and inaccurate.

Can you cover the pastry war on your next mini war videos?
I'd really like him to cover the cod wars
I sincerely hope Canada never goes away. You're all awesome and I hope to visit some day.
Man will perpetrate the most horrendous acts for the stupidest of reasons. (Didn’t South Park already declare war on Canada, LOL)
After decade, OverSimplified video released =)
Damn, those Canadians better start learning English quick.
Hey OverSimplified. You should do the Gallic wars
Plz do a video on Indian history
Everyone becomes so focused on the ending that the scream of President was less highlighted.   “Buchannon!”  “Owwwww Ohhhh”
Petition for having the next video made about the Indian Freedom Struggle.  Like to Sign.
I almost cried with that ending.
you should do the vietnam war
PHEW I AM GLAD THAT I WAS NOT THERE BOY
LOL I AM INDIAN HAH
LOL
YEEEhAAaAaaA *gun sounds*
Lete guess the banned video is banned in the EU because it's illegal to even have imagery of a bad bad sign here
that ending is insanly funny
Just me or is this video begging for a collaboration with alternate history hub lol
7:57 like this comment if you think that was a good rap out there. Mihajlo Bogdanović

Do vietnam war
sellout!
The Gospel: We sin against God and for our sins we deserve hell. We fall short of God’s perfect standard for heaven. But the good news is we have a way to be forgiven, that way is through Jesus. Because he loved the world, he came, lived a sinless life then died on the cross for our sins, paying the price for them which is death. He was buried and rose again on the third day. Because Jesus did this for us the gift of eternal life from God is offered to everyone. All we must do to be saved is put our faith in Jesus.✝️❤️
Please make video on indian history
Learning has never been this fun
Tulsa massacre
Please make a video about India

this place looks like emerald ranch in red dead redemption2
What is the song in the outro? :o
0:35 russia!!!!
Biden would lose a war with a fly
Oversimplified should next make a video about the Iraqi wars
7:57 we need a 1 hour version of this
Please make a video abaut the spanish civil war
Bruh
The end was worth the entire video
This is funny
Acualy canada sold a lot of forest to US for military prot
most epic ending EVER. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This could be seen as a pro second amendment video....kind of seems that the Americans wave a gun and the British back down lol
33:22 7:57
You gave the americans the courage to invade canada
At that time, men were real men not gays. So they didn’t think to kiss each other.
America use NordVPN?
Nah, I think Canada just should burn down the White House again, to teach those yanks some lessons of good manner and neighbourhood
:))) Jon Bercow cameo
Jizzingham
TF How the frick did I downloaded this 6 days ago I thought it was 2 weeks I downloaded this.
hello! just a question can you talk about Indonesia we have been overlooked for to long man
Kinda scared of U.S.A now
Hahahahah greatest ending ever miss your vids
:awesome:
In future don't go round on circles so much , I was so bored by the end not because I was interested in the war  but the fact you kept repeating yourself
it is british territory. yeah all fo you americans can roast me in the comments XD
Straight Line, Straight Line.
you've got to make more videos more often dude..
It’s so beautiful
as someone from canada we weren't that nice to indigenous people aswell and i mean we as in canada in the 19 hundreds
oversimplified pulled out all the jokes as if someone invited a girl to the group chat
Biden is a wussy
7:24 If it was truly British, there would be no 't'
Oversimplified, I have a question. Do you play Hearts of Iron IV? If you do, have you ever played The New Order: Last Days of Europe before? It's a mod for Hearts of Iron IV and it's a German victory mod. But the mod has so many details on countries and they also have fun mechanics. They have a country named Ordenstaat Burgund, led by the SS [Heinrich Himmler]. Burgundy is basically SS version of North Korea and it is located in Northern France. I suggest that you should check it out. Maybe you can start an alternate history series out of it
..
Divide the islands in the middle it was a good idea!
Barney Stinson likes the ending
Well.. you forgot India :(
Make oversimplified video on how anime girl have take over the planet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15:41  You can see the vietnam map on the left table
You can tell he had fun with this
If Biden could actually annex Canada for manifest destiny then I might actually like him.
So much to do so much to see so what's wrong with claiming a territory, you never know if you don't go, you'll never know native tribe woes HEY NOW YOU'RE AN ANGLO WHAT THE DANG THO, GO AWAY
Two words for ya: Moose mounties, eh?
2:84 byron
It’s wonderful to see how your animation has improved :)
1. As an American I can now only picture Americans exploding out of whatever transport they've used to get to new places. Be it giant ship, helicopter, bus, or monster truck.  2. Why was I do emotionally involved in the fate of that pig? My eyebrows shot up at that one tragic point.
Ksp hangar music playing at the backround
7:57 did you hear that ? :DDDDD
I didn’t expect the neutral narration to turn into patriotism that quickly :b
Hmm thats seams good
What should I comment... Straight line. Yea, straight line.  -----------------------------------------------------
🤣😂
Watch ur backs 😂😂😂😂😂
Can you please do the ottoman empire
😂😂😂😂 the Last 10 mins
Based
Why is no one talking about the Morgan freeman genie piggo?
Crazy ending  Great video
Damn your back
when the world needed him the most, he returned
Wholesome ending
“But he Americans kept coming And they don’t stop coming Hopped on their wagons and  hit the ground running” 7:57 Dababy ain’t nothing compared to this guy
Cho phụ đề tiếng việt được không
Cuối cùng ông cũng quay lại
The ending made me laugh so hard oh my gOD
Given certain globalist assholes are trampling on Canadians civil rights.... yeah i would be just fine with USA invading Canada... Then again same globalist assholes are eroding American civil rights so its kinda meh situation over all.
Hahahahaha! The only thing Biden is doing with a vengeance is sleeping and making everything more expensive! LOL!
Finally. He mentioned Canada.
i'll be watch my bag, or maybe back
4:08 lmao
_Oversimplify _*_Partition of India_*
The Morgan Freeman voice caught me so off guard
They don't stop coming and they don't stop coming head to their cars and I hit the ground running  didn't make sense not to live more fun ur brain gets smart but ur head gets dumb so much to do so much to see hey what's wrong taking the back streets you'll never know If you don't go you'll never shine if you won't glow
20:17 Is this one of the guys who defeated the Mexican army during the war? God, what a shame to be defeated by someone like him in the ranks of the enemy
As a canadian this terrified me 😰
He made this entire video and animation just because of complaints from the comments
Absolutely hysterical.
That motherf*cer shot his pig
Can you please do a video on the Roman empire
Wait,  that hey Arnold episode was based on real history?
This might be the least consequential event Oversimplified covered(that, or the emu wars), but this is my favorite video of his yet.
The entire Live Chat erupting in "USA, USA, USA" at the end.
do the Magellans voyage
Ha! Fools. You think America will invade Canada with their fragile, sensitive, "I have two moms," military? Think again.
Make a video about slavery. Especially how African tribes used too sell off their own people
This is the most legendary video ever
Another video from Oversimplified.❌ Another masterpiece from Oversimplified. ✅
Please make a video on pakistan
3:38- density
I thought the top like thing on the thumbnail was among us
Make Vietnam War Oversimplified pretty please
PREPARE YOURSELF CANADA!! THE EAGLE IS COMING, TRUDEAU CAN'T PROTECT YOU FROM US!!!
You should make a video about the Chernobyl disaster (Like a video that's completely dedicated towards the disaster)
You forgot about Point Roberts that tiny piece of land that's part of America but in order for Americans to access the rest of America they have to go up into Canada first.
Epic! 🤣
Next topic: Oversimplifies  Vietnam
Love me some PNW history :)
I'm just curious, at 6:33 when they said "you can unlock content blocked in your country", then pointed out the Hitler video.... If I'm to guess, does Germany not let its people watch anything about Hitler? Some other country? Or was it all made up?
Straight line?
best video
10:27 my mom when we are cheering baseball game too loud
What we draw on maps isn't real world populous.. oversimplified is correct. .
38:12 I don’t think Biden could invade anything more than a child’s personal space
I detect a Scottish accent .. can OverSimplified confirm whether my ear is deceiving me? Edinburgh?
I love how he just casually sings All Star
I don't think you talk about Lesotho enough on this channel. Please fix or i'll unsub.
7:56 nice rap oversimplified
Little annoyed the American pulled out a Russian gun..
I have a cabin up at San Juan Island and often visit the actual British and American camps that are there, so nice to see some reconizition for one for one of the strangest almost wars there was :)
The ending is funny
May you pls dl the Spanish war
Straight line solves all problem.
this part is also funny hahaha 33:29
LOL this part is so funny 33:22
Petition for oversimplified The crusades
I’d rather not invade Canada please and thank you!
Let's be real. Biden ant coming for anything the man's senile.
As a Canadian, it kinda makes me happy seeing videos that have something to do with my country :)
Finally a video
All i can say is that I don't know what to do with my life while I wait another 6 months for the next oversimplified video. Makes me wanna cry
Even as an American I feel bad for James Douglas at 16:26.
I am not even interested in Western History. I am here for the lols only and NOT disapointed at all. Thank you.
Could you do Vietnam War or Spanish Civil War, itd be highly appreciated
I love everything about this video  hold on, I'm from America  I meant to say: *gunshots* YEEEEEEHAAA-
I always been visiting your channel to see if you uploaded a new video. Now, I'm going to gather all my snacks to watch this funny yet educative video.
Bahahahah! 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
its ok OverSimplfied, you don't need to talk about canada anymore. I've had my fill.
Wow US have big p
What do the Islands even do nowadays? Give it to the British
Biden can’t cum into a sock let alone a country
Bring it Americans
Honestly I’m ready for America to invade Canada  It’s been long overdue
Is the Vietnam war next?
we need a Q and A from this guy,
Are we going to see a Vietnam war video?
You can use this as a dislike button. But please don't this video is great!
You're my favorite history teacher. I always learn a lot from your videos. With how entertaining and informative they are it's evident you put a huge amount of time and effort into them. I look forward to every one with great interest.
Bro upload
6th months later still the goat
Oversimplified: mentioned "Hudson Bays Company"  Northwind players:🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Why do I feel like this is making the country where I live look like savages?
wtf
Oversimplified how do you feel about vlogging through history who reacts to your videos
Teutonic Knights would be a nice topic
Video gets good at 37:09
this is my favourite video of yours in years! and I love all your videos
Do star wars
The ending made me cry onion
You should do the war of 1812 next
I declare you the archbishop of sigmas
you used the lol-face meme wrong. i am a canadian indian and i take offence to this video.
7:57, why do I feel the need to find a full length version of this
Nice video could you make the 100 years war next?
Funny stuff. Douglas looking a bit white for a man who wasn't considered so by the Americans (his mother was a Creole, so single drop theory probably made him count as black in most American eyes despite passing fairly easily as white, and he married a Metis woman), but the funny thing is he did indeed not like Americans. In fact, he didn't like them so much he made sure American ships were greeted by a black militia whenever their passengers got off the boat. Also, he was allegedly involved in a man being beaten to death with a shovel. The racial angle might have been involved in the dispute too, now that I think about it, at least if a hotheaded Slave owning Southerner was involved.  Also, while Wilhelm was indeed related to Queen Vickie, Germany was also in a bit of a rivalry with Britain, so agreeing to let the Germans arbitrate was basically incredibly one-sidedly unintelligent.
We need to take over all of Central America down to Panama also.  Then we just need Greenland from Denmark, to get our 5 Armies a turn.
I present all of you with….  ALL STAR - PIG WAR EDITION!! (Inspired by 7:54) Some king dude once told us the best was coming for us. But we aren’t the strongest dudes in the world. The king was looking kinda dumb, with his face full of dumb And the shape of an L on his forehead  The American’s keep coming, and they don’t stop coming.  Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running.  Didn’t make sense keep sharing Oregon, when they outnumbered them six to one.  So much to take, so much to feed So what’s wrong with taking the Oregon road? You’ll never know if you don’t go, You’ll never shine if you don’t glow. —————— Hey now, your a Colonist.  Get your guns up, GO. FIGHT! Hey now, your a Colonist Raise your head up, GO. PLAY! And all that gold will be yours.  Then your manifestation breaks the mold.
“Ruthless, collectivist, imperialist tendencies.” Your Marxist bias is showing. Tone the “ImPErIaLisM” crap down a bit. Sounds like commie gobbledygook.
He needs to talk about Canada more lol
I wonder if this guy is Canadian
And because of this, Thanksgiving was created ;) the slaughter of innocents.. just for back some years
Honestly I am an American, and I never knew who owned that tiny island.  So I was on the edge of my seat the whole episode about who got it lol
I love how this implies diarrhea is a uniquely American trait
oh no was good
I want a Napoleon plushy.
Nice
please do a video on india LOVE FROM INDIA
please do a video on india LOVE FROM INDIA

I think oversimplified in the video he was singing all stars
I like this video because I live on Vancouver island
"kick mcclellan in the shin" lol
The final part 🤣🤣🤣
The Thumbnail is a Avengers Level threat
It’s been only 3 days discovering this channel and I have watched every single video
“Who spoke to god” “… cat…”
BRO THAT ENDING GOT ME DYING
Hell yeahhhh your back 🤗❤
If we all ate more bacon war with Canada would never happen
Wars being started because of animals is getting outta hand lmao
God, that was glorious.
This man’s videos teaches me more about History than my whole time in school.
I wish you would quit it with the unfunny jokes and just get to the point.
Well, its official. Oversimplified has finally lost their marbles. All because of a story about a pig.
We gonna ignore 7:58 where he snuck "All Star" into this thing lmao?
Plus events leading to the Texas revolution
Can you make one about the Texas revolution
I didn't learn about this in school! I actually clicked on this video thinking it would explain why the Birds were so Angry, and why the Pigs were always stealing their eggs. Of course, now that I wrote it down, the answer is staring me in the face. DAMN YOU CANADA!!!!
Are u illegally stealing somebody’s sheeps and they ask u nicely to stop but u don’t want to? Well u are american! There is something called guns which go bang bang
I don't really mind sleeping with one eye open. It's the following day when I am awake with one eye closed that always bothered me.... Always felt half asleep.
techonobalde
I disliked the video
Please tell me oversimplified?? Do you have a companion with someone
"Indepedence, Baby!"
29:40 IM DYING RN
Ngl we should actually invade Canada
Is he ever gonna do Vietnam
that Ending tho
"Well then you, my friend, should use NORDVPN!" said a random Canadian.       "What the f-" said a random American
7:57 please oversimplified can you make a full song of that
I'm so angry that even though the video is about us Canadians, he still doesn't mention Canada even once
That ending tho....
The legend has returned
I just noticed, but why does Pickett look like a stoned out Ian Mcollum, aka Gun Jesus
I was honestly expecting you to say "Biden is coming to sniff your kids"  also canada looks good in red white and blue
Dang man literally the best history YouTuber in the game
31:06 sounds like virtuvius from the lego movie
This video is super racist
We need Holy Roman Empire @oversimplefiled
the last two minutes of this video is the content i subscribe for
Harney is basically every "protestor" at January 6.
The thumbnail reminds me of Star Wars
Can you do the war of 1812?
Scary 😟
Can you do an Oversimplified video about Spain? Maybe Spanish Inquisition, people think it was the worst thing ever but I read about it and it was actually really surprising. I used Spanish sources though, seemed more appropiate.
You have to do the war on terror next
Let's get out and make the world a better place! *exploding ox's and literally throwing mountains*
Oh, so this is what that one Black Sabbath song was about!
4:11
you really told Canada to keep an eye out for selener
you can not do that to us Canadians eh?
definitely the best video so far!
Poor pig :(
that last part when they took the flag pole make me laugh so hard
Before I die nordvpn is sponsored
did he do allstar?
37:12
Calling white people rats and a disease is sad. Seems kinda racist
I love these videos. However the constant framing of America and Americans as being inherently materialistic and evil in spite of its actions being historically in line with every other civilization in the world (look at the ethnic Egyptians living as second-class citizens in their own homeland) just annoys me. I respect your desire to create humorous and entertaining content, but can you do it without denigrating an entire culture and focus on the individuals involved in your story? Please?
A war nearly starting over potatoes and a pig? Sounds like Technoblade was here.
7:59 nice
"It works around all your devices, so your good on the go, even sic of them!"    That's 5 devices
As an southern American with British family and a northern family, I'm confused about who I should root for.
Who else heard him sing All Star
7:57 the best song ever
I love this video
Manifest Destiny sounds like an American Lebensraum. Change my mind
HA! If Biden’s coming then Canada has nothing to worry about.
Why are beavers being turned into top hats rather than felt hats? XD
i meant the war of burgers against syrup
That last seen was scary! What hockey team will move to Las Vegas??
the of burgers vs syrup
Oversimplified, I’ve followed you for a while, and I was wondering if you’ll do a Roman Empire Oversimplified? Thank you
if trump could do it....... I'm sure Drake can. I though you were gonna say Dababy....... Disappointing.
This ending. Was. BRILLIANT
Holy fuck the money this man is making is insane
Eh. I know how Canada can beat America in a war.  In fact the GOP has already put that plan into affect. >:)
The guy running around throwing McDonald's needs a spin off. Michael Keaton would be perfect.
Hey there can you do a video about outlaws of the old west
A war over a pig and there was a war over a bucket. History is entertaining
Easily the BEST one you've made so far. Your quality in animation has improved just as good as your voice acting has. Cant wait for the next one!
Also its time to re-organize your playlists!
Hey @OverSimplified. Can you make a video about the Viking age?
There should be a war of 1812 oversimplified.
Can you do Spain revelation please
It’s like Christmas came early: comment on this if you agree
Are we not going to speak of US packing? Man i wish i could eat a burger and get the package ( min 3:33 )
7:25
I like the all star reference at 7:57
I died of Laughter at the end
Dude, just build a better fence. It worked against the emus.
Am I also just now noticing the thumbnail is just a Star Wars poster
RIP to Spuddy and Porky
7:57 lol.
Over simplified 3000 years into the future The swisterland and shrek war
Long time subscriber. Always impressed by your high quality videos and apparent bravery with a lisp like that
glad I stayed for the ending lol
"MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE!"  -British Parliament
Benjamin got roasted 1:25
Always a good month when Oversimplified posts a video
Next American war you’ve ever heard of, Utah war
Woah, that twist at the end was really unexpected
37:25 left hand salute almost killed me
4:11 Now THIS should be the American dream.
Well I have to stay awake tonight knowing that oversimplified is gonna invade my country
Come on, man! End of sentence.
mean I'm in Canada
Best Channel on Youtube.
As a Canadian... I approve!
7:58 is he singing smash mouth
the spotted dick part killed me
My cousin is out fighting rebels and what do I get? Guard duty. - A US Soldier on San Juan Island circa 1863.  On a more serious note; this is probably the most in depth history of what happened on San Juan Island anyone has ever done so kudos.
You always forget India too! I bet there is loads of that rich, juicy content just waiting there for being 'capitalized' 👀 I mean 'monetize'👀 uh.. sorry.. I mean 'educationalize'🙇
It's really sad when you realise that the series who's entire point is simplifying history to be digestible teaches more than a secondary school history class isn't it?
31:08  That laugh thouh😂
LMAO "Affordable insulin" also, healthcare?
this guy is just a entertaining history teacher. love that u finally posted again 😡
This video makes it sound like they wanted to expand for the sole purpose of killing non white people
stop we dont want another war but we want drake
I’m here because of oversimplified pig war…yeah I had to watch it again
Big comeback of Oversimplified
Best ad transition ever
I mean they had literally just one a war against a white country and didn't we fight the French at some point? That white people comment at the beginning was unnecessary.     (Before you call me a white supremacist I'm Mexican)
I think you should say nicer words
Video idea : Vietnam war , Bay of pigs invasion and The Balkan wars
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED AHHH!! .....
Bro stop being racist against whites, of course we should take what we want from the minorities
The part at 4:13 is way too accurate.
America is the most ridiculous country of all time
Honestly, it's interesting to think that if that war actually started, the US army would have been in an already weakened state by the time the Civil War started. That and the British may have been more likely to more directly intervene on the side of the South. It's entirely possible that if things went different here, the USA wouldn't exist in the way it does now. There may even be two seperate countries where in our time there is only one..  All of that... because some idiot shot a pig.
RETURN OF THE KING
poor pig  :(
Tell me, if you run out of wars to make content about are you going to start one?
Canada will never become part of your disgusting selfish empire
Man this guy hates america
33:28 is hands DOWN my favorite clip of oversimplified EVER
1:22 OOOOOOOOOOOOOH BENJAMIN ROASTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Texas history and Mexican American war next?
What the hell oversimplified
As a person from Alabama it’s shocking that I didn’t know what the CSS Alabama was until I googled it but I did know what was the USS Alabama was.
You should do what if 😂 what if Germany wins or what if US invaded Canada 😂
Since y'all take half a year to make a video, I think it would be fitting if that video be the history about..... PING PONG (a.k.a ball ball)
Me who lives in canda
Loved it
Oh no! Our home! It’s broken!
If you guys are up to stupid reasons to start a war then how about War of Jenkins Ear?
This video has been out for 5 days wtf YouTube
omg the ending
My conclusion is: God bless America
4:15 taken over land slaughtering wildlife, and screwing up the land that sums it up
Hey. Great vid. Please make one about Iran. A recommendation, the f*cking Islamic revolution that teared the whole middle east apart.
I want you to do the homeland war-croatias independece
Did Oversimplified just single-handedly declare war on Canada on behalf of the US?
Hey uhhhhh… some of us are Canada, I don’t think your very friendly now, your just rude when you said that at the end of the video, your pretty uncool, I need to give your video a dislike.
can you do 7 year war
Could you do the Swedish great power era? It’s such an interesting story and I’d love to hear you try to pronounce the names :D
I love this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 7:33
What's the actual name of the war?
Who knew a pig caused so much beef
After 6 months, he's back.
The end was beautifull
Me when oversimplified launches a video:😱😱😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😳😱🤯🤯🤯🤬🤬🤬🤬😐😐😐
Mr. Narrator, you hate yourself a lot...   Sincerely yours - a Russian bot.
Can you do the trail of tears next?
loved the ending
You should make outfits for your plushie and sell them on your merch store
Biden would probably forget about the invasion plan lol
plot twist joe biden watched the end of the video and all the stuff actuallly happened
This guy makes history so much funnier
wow, i love this channel
see yall in 5 months
I love how this man just started rapping at 7:59 minutes
I gave this video a thumbs up too early.. 🤣🤣 I see your real plan now 🇨🇦🥴 sorry
Comments: You never talk about Canada.  Oversimplified: Hold my beer, I'm going big on this one.
The early Republic conquered the West from the Native Americans cause they could, it had nothing to do with their skin color.
I jokingly call Canadian friends as North American.
Hello, you know I was thinking that maybe you could do an oversimplified video about the great siege of 1565. But that's for you to decide but please make it funny.
Steamy McSteamface Tours is the tourist business we need.
I live in Seattle and I wasn't sure who won the islands until the end 😅
are you serious ?  lmfao.
Greatest end to any Oversimplified video ever...
Would you do a video of the Mexican American war?
Don't blame the pig. He was just imitating the same property right respect he saw from his british owner
Idk if you do them or not, but I have a request. Would it be possible for you to do a history video about a math topic? There are no fun videos like this to use in a math classroom. Maybe about something like Pythagorean theorem and how Pythagoras took all the credit for something he barely knew about.
VEATNAM WAR OVERSIMPLIFIED???????????????????????????
Hey oversimplified can you plz oversimplifie the 80 year war between the netherlands and Spain?
4:10 holy mother of... I love your videos man xd
10:11
Biden is definitely no threat to anyone.
Learned more in this video then I did from an entire trimester of history class. Either your really good, or my school sucked.
Dangit Harney, you glubbo!
Space race
Ideas: Missions and Texas vs Mexico  Ancient Greece Gold rush Korean War Vietnamese war
Hornby used VPN so that's why he was such a cool guy.
This whole thing, I feel can be summarised with "but the americans had guns". It kinda makes its point too, no one could mess with americans it seems
Can you do the Roman Empire?
Hah. That Biden joke didn't age well.
I just got this recommended after watching a Technoblade video lmao
I do enjoy a cleverly placed ad. 👍🏼
lol the part of George's mole is soooooooooo funny!
i don't know what's different but the humo(u)r on this one is exceptionally TOP NOTCH
This was amazing
Canada needs america it's a better government than what they have lol
That plush will be mine
Wooo
The animation of oversimplified has only gotten better please continue the good work
Next PewDiePie vs T-Series, the war that changed  Gen-Z
3:40 "Like rats"  Um Excuse me That is a gerbil
The last few Oversimplifieds have been pretty bad. Did they run out of wars or something?
America did bad
Clever advert there, friend. Didn't even skip it. Respect where it's due.
Make videos please
Fuck yeah!  Let's invade Canada!
I'm obsessed with this episode lol
In the event of WW3 the anexation of both mexico and canida by the usa by diplomacy or otherwise, would be required for the nations servival
My solution for Canada is build stairs at ur border
Who’s ready for another video In 6 monthsV
33:25
The rhyming at 7:57 was just awesome.
If America ever invaded now in 2021 it would go so poorly because we could just offer their troops a better life up here when they come to invade and we just open arms and show them free healthcare and that our country isn't a sheethole where everyone is angry all the time.
7:57 - 8:05
The sponsor was funny ngl
THAT ENDING WAS 100% AMERICAN 😂
Lol loved this one,
I found this part hilarious 33:25
I live in Washington State, so I've heard about the Pig War, was very excited to see this
Seems like oversimplified's gotten a little psychotic over the last 6 months
12:03 uhhh just a correction, it's not 'berk-sheer' its pronounced 'bark - sheer', named after the county of Berkshire
Thank u so much for the upload been watching Since the ww2 videos and I swear u could make the history of the spoon an amazing story, keep em coming👍
Is this the first Oversimplified without a single named female character?
America and Britain: Straight line? Straight line?  North and South Korea: Straight line? Straight line.  North and South Vietnam: Straight line? Straight line.
i cant belive this took 6 months does he not hace an animation team
Time to go rewatch all his other ones now
I saw this video when I was in school when the class video was over
I've been saying we should anex Canada for years, may as well take Mexico while we're at it.  But sadly the only  thing Biden can confidently take is a nap
What countries is the Hitler video banned in?
Straight line? Straight line.
No idea that episode in Hey Arnold where Abner almost got eaten by the rich kid and his granddad was based in historical fact… mind blown.
Can you do the Mexican revolution and the Texas revolution ant the southAmerican revolution please oversimplified
Do oversimplified the war of 1812
whoa whoa whoa...I didn't say they were white people YAYYYYYY
Hey can you please do a history on the polish Soviet war plz. I would love to see a video of that!!!!
YEEEESS another oversimplified video this man is the reason I’m still alive
Was the pig in the flashback voiced by Morgan Freeman or someone who does a really good impression
OH YEA! THE PIG WAR SEALED THE SUBSCRIPTION DEAL FOR ME!!!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!
Just operation red :P
The ending was the scariest thing I've ever seen
Bet Oversimplified will not make a video about how Russia had Alaska and then sold it to the americans
lol the end
what was that ending
Notice how his schedule went from a video per every 3 months, then after the Henry VIII video he’s taking much more time to make his videos. Very good, Mr. Simplified. It shows how hard he’s working in every video
Straight-line? Straight-line!
33:30 lmfao love this scene
Man, the long wait was well worth it. Excellent job, Oversimplified! Make the next one about the Mexican-American War or the Mexican Revolution of the 1900s.
This just shows why Winfield Scott was the real G but we can do without that ending..
make an oversimplified vid on the Yugoslav Wars (+the Kosovo War) & the likes/dislikes would be hidden & comments disabled : P
Oh the British 😂
omg the ending
And also I think that NATO and CANZUK will help Canada if the US ever invaded
In 5:01 it writes let's imagine how ironic
29:43 C'mon, man. Fergie said it best, and everyone knows it: Big girls don't cry.
Straight line? Straight line.
Roman Empire next please
Hello I am an American man from New Jersey here to say oversimplified’s idea of conquering Canada does not reflect onto all Americans I honestly think it’s extremely stupid please do not take this in any offense sincerely a Random dude in New Jersey
Do vietnamn next!
Cringe.
1:18  was a sick burn
We need pls Roman Empire oversimplified
if it wasnt for white people to colonize the americas, the natives would have still lived in bushes
I keep watching it
3:33 Oversimplified really did Florida dirty like that :/
I have so much homework due but this takes priority
Lmao, let them keep syrup town.
POV: your looking for angry vegans  in the comments
Please do Alexander campaign, facing Cyrus the Great, love from Persia 💜💛💜
Pickett huh? That couldnt possibly be the Pickett from Picketts charge.   30 mins later  Oh my.
Beautiful singing: 7:56
3:38 density?
33:40 the eloquent written language of the time is beautiful and concise
7:58 nice Shrek reference out there
"GERMANY WE NEED YOU" "What?" "WHICH ONE OF US OWNS THIS TINY ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC???" "Are you fucking kidding me?"
I waited 6 months for this…?
"I didn't say they were WHITE pepole" That's the best racist joke I've ever heard in my life.
can you do the occupation of the Spanish in the Philippines plssss
Mr grifenes grate grandson went with Michael Collins to sign the treaty
28:00
The pig looks like a certain pig from the show “gravity falls”
This one was the best animation video you ever made. A lot of jokes man, I love it and I learned a lot about that part of the history. Thank you for making this videos for us.
Why isn´t a video about the Spanish Empire? Just asking, cuz I´m Spainsh, and it seems that in a lot of your videos you just pass up on them. BTW, excellent content, I´m just asking for it cause I´d love to see the Hagsburg monarchy Oversimplified.
I'm surprised that no one is talking about how James was saying Noo while the Americans built mcdonalads 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cheers my guy.
0:49 racism was wide spread back then
7:57
mini wars - peasants revolt
One of your best
7:57 to 8:01 he legit spit bars
Biden isn't coming, clearly has onset early dementia. However, Canada that sweet, sweet uninhabitable land is looking appealing!
Trinston was here  .
Video recommendation: do the war of 1812 >:)
Im glad the line is straight, otherwise I would be a Canadian!
I don't why but I thought the video would be about the lore of Angry Birds.
this sounds... familiar
@14:44 we have the first “EH” 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
can you do the american mexican war?
Can you do Ireland history?
nice ending
I don’t think you’ve done any videos about Sam Marino
I don’t think you do a video about Estonia that much or or Lithuania
I don’t think you talk about the Balkans that much
You don’t talk a lot about Moldova a lot in your videos
Hey oversimpified you should do the khmer genocide.
I have a question what is your next video going to be about my I suggest the Wild West
What’s the background song at 16:32 called?
the ending.... LOL
Asking the Germans to decide was only going to go one way!
On some maps there is a lake that it is better not to enter, while in other maps it is almost the same, but you can drive through. And if you accelerate the speed of the car.
I must say, this pig is cute. I feel sorry for little Berkshy🥺
I Love your Animation and voice, it’s so fun and I’m learning too. Fun fun fun
Take the L 💪🇺🇲
"The Pig War"  Me: damn I never knew there was a police war.
Canada been real quiet since this video
Canada is too old for Biden, he's not interested
Your videos are truly amazing. Topics that one would think are boring, you make them so enjoyable👍🏻
but what if I like giving my password to strangers...
PALPATINE PIG ONLY FOR LEGENDS
It's wild to see my part of the world getting a deep dive like this. And it's not wildly inaccurate (from a local's perspective).
God damnit I knew soon the woke crap would follow here too lmao
I have learned more from this man than school many many times over and I love how he can make it enjoyable. Schools will drain your interest to much that you end up hating the subject or topic at hand but this man, this man makes me wait in anticipation for another video because he makes the learning interesting. Thank you.
Make the Roman empire
Can you make mexican for independent war
Instead of mc Donald's   it should be  dollar general stores lol
33:29-33:35 I like how Captain Hunt's face is like "Wtf" as he's watching General Scott hurl a chair at General Harney and starts beating him with his belt.
Straight line?
i like there telephone system nord
I about lost it at the Smash Mouth reference 🤣
What if the man would have built his fence all the way so it would be avoided
Oversimplified is now featured in memes this guy us really the king
Drake for president!!!
No you are not invading Canada
2:30 its nice to see canada get some attention once in a while considering we get shadowed by the USA  I love being a Canadian commenter lol
Soo good to have you back oversimplified. I swear your storytelling of history is unique and entertaining! Would love to see videos on the Vietnam war, maybe even the Mexican American war, Simon Bolivar and gran colombia (bias since I’m colombian lol also cuz we need to shine some light to Latin American history it’s often neglected by American and European history). Oh yeah and if we doing ancient history… one on the Roman Empire would be lit afff.
Oversimplified next video the war of 1812
what is it with british and islands?
3:33 lmao america has a dick
This dude is a genius
Your voice acting gets even better with each video
Can you make a video about the yugoslavian wars
This guy is a geniuos.!!!
I love your videos
Can you do a video about the 30 year war
HES BACK YEHHHH
"Usa invades canada" Me in argentina: "calls a brazilian friend" dude what happened over there My brazilian friend: idk but a lot of canadians are coming to brazil!
Love the crowd mumbling at 3:47     *"Who was it that spoke to god?"* -It was Billy right? -I thought it was Sharons cat. -I hear voices all the time.  *I'm dead*
By the time the San Juan Islands gained full ownership to the United States, Winfield Scott already died on May 29, 1866. Had it not been for him, The Pig War, what was initially a border dispute/confrontation between the two great powers, would have been turned into a true conflict.
So I guess we just declared war on Canada
its actually the middle channel
Man, someone said quality of quantity and man with the production in this i couldnt agree more
38.12  This angered the Canadians, who punished them severely.
This made more sense than a whole 11 years of history on school
0.00001% of people watching this video are from new brunswick
The man came back
I think you should make a video on the dutch revolt, it's pretty complicated and interesting.
Has the USA ever not been the bad guy in a story?
That was hilarious! Honestly, I had never heard of The Pig War, but now I'm obsessed!
Can u please make a video about India in British era(I mean the time when they ruled British). I have a lot to study about it.
fun fact: there's a very small island north of san juan island that is named after my great great great great (great?) Grandfather, Jacob Jones
when are you going to do nam?
Vietnam war episode when ?
36:57 the start of the greatest speech ever
This channel makes me actually enjoy learning
That was a cool video. See you guys again in 5 months.
Oversimplified, I love you man, but I’m not sure why your Hitler video being banned in Germany is news to you
I have An Idea of a story  Is in Serbia Branislav Nusic.
can you please do the 80 years war/ the dutch revolt?
Yet another Christmas gift brought by oversimplified
Yo chill Canada and USA Are both cool
Lmao that last bit was beautiful!
“It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig” is my favorite quote of all time
Imagine a country fighting for a tiny island filled with sheep lol
When are you going to do the Vietnam War???
Какой интересный урок истории
Im so happy to see a new video from you
God damn this had me in tears. Probably the best early Christmas present... Never stop man, love these videos!
Ok we can all agree the voice acting was amazing right?
When he was needed most, he returned.
Like rats, or disease! Everyone watching:
I still love your videos, but if you say something like that to my country I will, hunt you down and unsubscribe
4:15: As the soldier from TF2 would've said it: "This point is mine!"
help
I honestly think the UK and Europe would side with Canada if it came to that😅
33:29
I love the ending scene
Woah! What was that? The ending!!!🤣🤣🤣
Never realized nordvpn's logo can make up a character's hairstyle.
Another amazing video!🔥 Thank you!
<unsub>
woke shit
Ad sponsor on this video never cease to amaze me it alway a surprise of wonder you never expect when ad appear and it also has hint of comdies to me and smooth transition
"The kid war"
over simplified went nuts at the end of the video
I always wonder why US border was kinda quirky. I get the answer perfectly in this video. Straight line, it is!  Thank you so much for 30 min of laugh 👍 I enjoy it so much.
Another fabulous Presentation.  A generous request to Oversimplified, can you please make a video on the History of the Indian Subcontinent.
38 minutes of sweet content all because of a pig
Actually Canada has a pretty bad ass army
My man really said 'I've got my spotted dick' and didn't think he should see a doctor about it
This video might be your best one yet, the storytelling, the humour and the animations are top notch. Keep it up, you're one of the best creators out there
This really is overly simplified. The British only helped the south because they believed that if the south won, they'd have an easier target to take the entire US back. Also, this is the most CRT representation of history I've ever seen...  I'm curious about what REALLY happened now, because lord knows, this isn't it.
Funniest Oversimplified vid ever         Why was the potato wearing my shoes?
well in reality the imperialism is real  america french brits all in africa and middle east
This guy has an accurate portrayal of British House of Commons LOL.🤣🤣🤣
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I liked the nod to Smash Mouth’s All Star at 7:57. That made me chuckle
Now you are back....thanks for vedio
Can we get a video on Umayyad caliphate in Europe?
why the hell Griffin looks like Henry VIII xD
I remember that America had to keep an eye on Russia in Ukraine and China in Asia
More complex things to oversimplify,” crusades or Northern war”
Man you got to do Chinese communist revolution
5:30 why both flags go different directions?
So much of history is just people being petty morons.
Maybe next time a Hundred Years' War, The War of the Roses and Great Northern War. It will be awesome ✊
Why does the pig sound like Morgan Freeman towards the end 😂
Ngl history is full of weird shiet
i didn't know my siblings were in a war
I'm sceard I will sleep with 1 eye opened and
Epic video as usual.
I had heard of this incident before.  This straightened one or two things out for me.  Great video.  In actual fact, I am not sure the USA could have survived war against the Secessionists and the British Empire at the same time, and, as you say, it would have been in the British interest to secure the cotton supply.  Good thing that good sense prevailed.  Us British did once go to war over someone getting his ear cut off, so it was not beyond the bounds of possiblility...
14:34 The best part of the video.
Please do Vietnam war next
*FINALLY U DID IT!!!!* IM SO HAPPY ;DDDDDD
You made history fun not gone lie
29:18  -Buchanan  -*AhHhHhhHhHhHh*  The voice acting is Chef kiss
7:57 did i just get shreked roll ???
Do u guys see the thumbnail is kinda sus
I blame Sharon's cat
HAHAHAHA STOP THIS WAS ACTUALLY AMAZING LMAO
I see every people are so angry. Lol it might be good with Burma champaing in ww2.
make something on india we have a lot of history
2:19 Thought this was a Joni Mitchell references at first because in her song "A Case of You" she sings "I drew a map of Canada, oh Canada."f
I swear only American's see themselves as the good guys in these stories. Seems almost every American history moment is America being a dick, and winning.
Amazing videos keep it up bro
Do the Turkish war of independence next
Remember when 2 years ago in you video about the cold war you promised to make one about the vietnam war? 👉👈
He got a deeper voice, not surprised, its been 6 months
As a Canadian I'm sure our many allies will jump at the chance of defending us. Also maple syrup is amazing stuff.
another overbeaver remove random crits
One of your best
Never underestimate the power of a Pig
Noboy;s gonna talk about that there is a TV at 2:55?
"I've been waiting years for this I hate you I've always hated you" -winfield Scott
merica
so much "its cool right now" white hate. I hope you got brownie points.
32:13 well WW2 start because someone get rejected by art school
can you do vietnam war
7:32 16:35
HAHA THE ENDING i、IS BTR THAN ENDGAME
Still waiting for the Vietnam war
i love the correkt depiction of the early us its right till today
At the end it’s soooo cool!!!!!!!
Maybe, russo-japanese or balkan wars for the next "short" series?
Canadian invasion of the USA you say....?
can u make video about Syrian war, plz!
masterpiece
Hey, every life matters, man. Every life matters.
Ok           anty-canadian ideas  ha???       American hitler ha?    againts canadian jews ha?   simplified hitler?  :)
7:57 litteraly blew me away how you get so creative its so astonishing
That ending is great
You should make videos on middle east !
Straight line?  Straight line.
This is the best video you have ever done
Yessir
4:09 best oversimplified scene ever!! 😂
This is the best one he’s made by far. Well done
First ever oversimplified I stopped before the end. Really annoyingly imbalanced towards 'humour', which used to be an aspect of these rather than obtrusive. Sadly, most of the gags simply aren't funny.
Well, that was an awkward note to leave the video on.   *Grabs popcorn*
Surely do one on Frederick the great. The story where he gets saved by the young Russian tsar is brilliant
what in the godname is this ... hmm MORE  XD
Yeah we germans have in the past the same idea like the americans with their destiny. Its called Lebensraum.😬
HE'S BACK!
I appreciated the Fresh Prince call back with the differing recollections of the Pig Murder.
This video is inaccurate. There has only been 42 yee-haw said. That’s too little yee-haws, between 100-150 yeehaws is more accurate   1/10 accuracy
And US don't forget what happened in Vietnam
what the actual fart happened there? I thought that was going to be a segway into a wargame ad, not weiredly voiced propaganea!
can you make a video about the balkan wars
Wow. 37 minutes and massive detail on a conflict I had never heard of. "Oversimplified"?
Been waiting for a new video nice
This was amazing!!!
i like peas
7:58 💀💀
I think I got this recommended because I watch Technoblade clips.
In the office  the scream bro and the belt slap harney
All star smash mouth! Amazing
You showed Canadians worse nightmare in that last bit
7:58 I didn't see what you did there in the first place but *somebody just told me*
Great to see that those B2’s are in service for such a long time already! 🤣
Great video as usual but that ending was top notch.
The way you brought in those smash mouth lyrics was so smooth
I'm going to share this video every time some says a women shouldn't lead. She's too emotional.
Ukraine
All I got from this 38min video is that good morning kitten is a real website
Life happened so slow back then omg
Thankyou god Canadian colonies did not become part of USA. Such a horrible, soul crushing thought.
he's actually gonna wait til 2027 to make a vietnam video
Can you do a video of finland
I find it funny how oversimplified choose funny history stories.
I really loved your videos a couple years back, it’s sad that the quality of the humour has continued its descent.
0:45 (racism) 1:21 (oof) 1:52 "straight line?" 2:56 "straight line?" 3:45 (religion) 5:15 (idk what to put here) 5:51 (Nord VPN) 7:27 (America) 8:47 "there's your straight line" 9:18 (WTF) 13:28 (sheep noises) 14:36 (sherif Barnes) 15:51 (American uses Ak) 16:28 (America pt2) 18:45 *gunshot* 32:30 "you're an idiot" 32:36 "you guys are fine" 33:29 (screaming girl)
best video yet
the slow descent into madness is what makes this video amazing
Love the egyptian eagle on the flagpole at 37:45
Best
You know when someone says 37:13 “Why not? WE have the manpower?” You know its all down-hill from there
I can't get my head round the fact that a general or leader of a country has the power to send countless soldiers to their death on account of irrational thinking or just blatant hot headedness. Suppose now every soldier in the world declared they just won't fight and left every world leader to hash it out in room with a knife any time they have a dispute.
Can you do Vietnam war pls
I do firmly believe Canada will one day become a part of these United States, thought I believe peacefully and not within my lifetime
Petition for this fine fellow to do a video on Ghengis Khan!?!
The ending is usa cosplaying as china  but instead of Taiwan it's Canada.  Shiid why not invade for the lulz.
Prolly the funniest OverSimplified video to date
🙏🙏Pleased One video of Indian history..
Next is the potato war.
R.I.P. Piggy.
Make a whole life of pope
*Ending Rant from the video* Me: ...right on
the OverSimplified war of 2022
This channel is just on another level
I now say in my head when something happens.., " hopefully this won't cause anyone to DIE!!!!! Lmao
Are you telling me a war between Britain & the US practically broke out because an American shot an English pig?? WTF
the king... his back!!!
And General Harney has all kinds of crapped in the PNW named after him today.
Everyone: "Vietnam oversimplified!"  Oversimplified: "Ight I heard the pig war"
This also shows how cruel history of amercian and european ancestors is ! Just living like primitive men
without western expansion none of us are alive today....
14:03 nice encapsulation
CaNAdIan BaCOn wOuld bE oUrSsssSss!!!!!!!
Bro Nice touch you added in the end. I really liked it there.....😀😀😀
This video is just too funny not to watch it. All the historical characters seemed like freaky perverts. I had to save this video to my YouTube channel playlists for others to watch.
37:12 what is this cursed
can you please do a vietnam war video ?
"Get Rekt" LMFAO
The Ending? Pure poetry
THE LEGEND RETURNS!
But how they get Alaska?
I freaking love these videos
i want you do the korean war  and the battle of youltong and i will give you the scrip in battle of youltong china: hey look the philipines has low numbers than us we can capture the- philipines: no "released his machine gun".
IF YOU UPLOAD AGAIN BEFORE CHRISTMAS ILL CLIMB EVEREST

Plz make a video in ind vs pak 1971
Oh what's the next 2 parter? Vietnam  war? The crusades? I'm pumped. Love this channel
It’s always nice seeing your hometown in a video
"Pickett, I've got a plan"   those words would come back later to haunt him
Yeah oversimplified  should do a video on india
Hey oversimplified pls next video about India  please
I mean why not lmfao 🤣
38:11 PHRASING! FIRST! BOOM!
I hate myself for watching you videos for 2 years but I never subscribed 😢😞
Go to 37:00. You're welcome :)
holy ffff 6 months ago?
What a great closing speech, truly marvelous 👏👏
Man that sponser transition was smooth
LOVE YOUR SHOWS. Next you should to the hatfields and mcCoys
kinda wish school taught about this
Awesome video! Love ur style man! Is there a way u could do sum Roman history.. or Greeks?
12:24 I was in the VAB when this song came on. Felt weird playing Kerbal while hearing what I undeniably associate with Kerbal not coming from the game itself.
We need Benedict Arnold
That is Buchanan summed up in a few seconds absolutely perfectly...  Also the US wasn't that great of a military power pre Civil war. But very much so afterwards. That may have influenced the british.
Maybe you could do The Punic Wars
Fans: I wonder what Oversimplified will make a video about next. Maybe the Vietnam War, Korean War, or the Crusades.  Oversimplified: You guys wanna hear about a dispute over some small islands and a pig?
I'm from the Philippines, can you do the Philippine revolution?
best channel
nice rhymes man.
Please make more of these videos
wow it would be interesting if both biggest democratic nation goes to war
Oversimplified while high is the best
"I thought it was sharens cat"
The ending though 🤣🤣😂🤣
Ok peace
I have to say, I've always been sketched out by a VPN, but them supporting your page makes me like Nord so much.
cooooooooooooool
Canada people are thanking you
The pig sounds like Morgan Freeman.
Yessir finally a new upload
I grew up were the pig war was and just the other day my dad told us about it
If it can saves us from Turdeau...
If ya try to take Canada me and the rest of the UK will end you without hesitation
What did i stumble upon? Love it
I absolutely love each and every one of your videos.
DO A VIDEO ON THE SUB-CONTINIENT
Finally new upload
the end of this video reminding me of the Oliver Hazard Perry Monument in  ohio looking across the great lakes.  "We have met the enemy and they are ours;"
May we get a Roman Empire one plz
This isn't what happened, at all.
This is awesome. I’m a Canadian and it’s a shame I never learned any of this. I’ve always wondered why the boarder was so straight. I love these vids keep em coming!
6:21  seems like oversimplified try to get more audience from ARMY
i want adolf's father plushie
31:48 the way he walks had me in the floor 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭
I am surprised you have not done a Texas Revolution video yet
BAAAAAA!!!!!
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
MERRRICA YEAH wat CANADA
The anti-American sentiment isn’t the least bit subtle
We need more episodes. That was awesome
I like how the arms and legs are positioned in such a way in the USA character design that Florida looks like a
That pig deserved it - From an unbiased American
Can you make a video on chola empire
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NEW VIDEO
I've lived in Washington almost my whole life and have never heard this story, 10/10 this is my new favorite
I love Canada why you want to make the Why do you want to cook Canada to go away😭😭😭😭😭
I didn't even realize the title photo is a star wars reference lol
When he said lead by president drake I died 😂
I love how America is the villain
INCITMENT OF VIOLENCEEEEEEEEEE :000000
He’s got to do the Punic wars
The thumbnail design is changing now the characters in the middle.
I live in Washington state, where the hole thing happened
Vietnam war?
He's back yeahhhh
this whole video is blood vs crips
US could have invaded Alberta because there’s OIL there
And I wonder why America supports  Israel against the poor native Palestinians
I loved the ending
You said it is no.1 video in Canada and you are saying to take over canada
PLS POST MORE
gotta love how they gave Vancouver Island to the brits and fought over the Islands but ignored the peninsula that is Point Roberts. I mean, seriously, for the sake of simplicity, that should be Canadian Territory
Finally
Couldn't they have just asked dude who owned the island?
best oversimplified video by far
38.5 minutes? seriously? Do I look like some ancient scholar, with a white beard down to my waist? I know you like all your little inside jokes and funny drawings, but get control of yourself. Just because your cartoonist drew something, you don't have to include every last suggestion. Who's in charge here, anyways? 38.5 minutes, and not one beaver joke? Sigh.
You should do the vietnam war
ARE ALL THE VOICES IN THIS HIS??? GODDAMN, HE'S GOT GOOD VOICE ACTING
the way you said "BIDENS COMIN' BABY" is comedy gold
31:03 BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!!!! Did you really get Morgan Freeman on the video? LMAO LMAO LMA0 LMAO
This feels more like "The Pig War-OverComplicated"
the last minute is...
Such a devastating war
If President Trump had wanted to invade Greenland, I see no reason why Biden wouldn't have a "senior moment" and invade Canada.
"But being an American he merged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife"  ......... I didn't know it was possible to be both incredibly proud and quite insulted at the same time.
Oversimplified is the biggest chad in the world, I bet you’re swolle and hit the gym a lot
I remember reading about the pig war in a Washington State History book
Why isn't this titled MiniWars 5?
Long live Canada 🇨🇦
(American invasion of Canada) 37:13 :)
yo what happened with george and his mole?
So many good parts in here though my favorite is both troops were at peace for years after they removed that idiot.  Than only after the Civil war ended they finally got around to deciding the boarder.
Star wars?
this is so funny
guys im canadian and i havent slept for 5 days, i see him every where. i need help
Canada would win that war cuz if you didn't know we still are under British Commonwealth so the U.K. would help us at war if we asked And the only wars Canada has lost, we weren't a part of - so we also technically won
Even i heard you edit "kind" to the end of "man" in your NordVPN ad and I'm listening on my cell phone speakers with the dryer and heater running.
Y does the logo look like Star Wars li
I love how the Senator aggressively shouting “Yeeee HAAAW!” in the Brit’s face.
Why is oversimplified almost always so anti american???
tecnobladeeeeeeeeeeeee
Can you do the Mexican revolution next pls🇲🇽
1:00 error. it is missing the second n in independence, leaving it spelled indepedence.
That last part got me im a canadian
"ITS MY DENSITY!!!"
Why do I think "Biden is coming!!!!" Would really be a soft dry flakey face powder?
Next please do Toyota War
His all American tone near the ending sounds suspiciously a lot like Plankton from SpongeBob SquarePants 👀
Dont taunt the Canadians with war, their War Geese have all the fury of Hell within them, we wont stand a chance.
as a Canadian I am personally insulted(37:48) by the way that was a joke don't take that seriously
Me, watching the end as a Canadian: '.' ....
When you led with that ending and I was expecting a mobile game segway...but I cost something so much better. God bless.
3:38 no one noticed the typo lol
Hua dusocorvered tou today.  Loving you already.
14:10  Had me laughing in tears
You should make clothing and accessories for ur plushies bc the characters are so dynamic
Bro make a video on INDIA and british
You'll never get me maple syrup!
legends has it that the pig war was putted to top 10 most intense near-war anime scenes
Sometimes I don’t know whether or not you like America… great video as always!
what a plot twist at the end
7:56
I like how the British angrily freaks out Buchanan behind the curtain 29:11
hey mr oversipiflid why did canada give up ther nukes
Plz make a video about india also
Now do the vietnam war
Please do the war on terror
32:31 You’re an
"Straight line?" "Straight line."  Answer to all your border problems.
That was amazing, well done!
Being from Washington, the Pig War is a major part of our lore.
We need more vids these are funny
i expected a simple explanation of a war between pigs
God we truly are so fucking dumb
3:31 The Kardashians, in a nutshell
manifest destiny
Pretty good,... it could have used a bit more Canada though...
Hmmm...I wonder if you can do a video on the Hundred Years War between England and France.
The end killed me :D
Thank you SO MUCH for slowing down the narration!  Previous videos were narrated way too fast which detracted from the awesomeness of the videos.  :-)  Thanks!
nordvpn after creating oversimplified: *STONKS*
Funny how you end this pointless American victory video with your anti Canada rant but quickly gloss over the actual war these two nations fought that the Americans should have won handily but lost because of their complete ineptitude. Where's the video on the war of 1812?  Too humiliating for your American audience?
👍👍
Pls do The Vietnam War
7:59 is a reference to a song, can someone tell me what song it is please?
Next you should do the early 1900’s China. Maybe from the boxer rebellion to the Japanese invasion/ communist take over. It’s an interesting part of world history that I don’t think gets enough love.
This is the funniest history story I've heard in a while.   It is hilarious to me how you describe the governments, as they never clarify anything, basically creating the conflict by telling everyone from settlers, government officals, and generals it was "their" land. So they milked the situation while acting in the legal bounds of protecting "their" territory.   Also funny how the British governor was the first to move a government official on the island and the American response is in line with the gun slanging characterization throughout the video.
OMG this guy like The Simpsons. Predicting what’s going to happen. Biden would actually do that.
The Union is dope.... but will always raid your land.
Let's take a look at that mole George
The Kanye vs. Drake Election would settle the album dispute for good. Im all for it
His drawing of Charles' berkshire is absolutely cute☺️☺️
31:49 seeing this in an oversimplified video feels wrong. why is the pig walking
Buchanan!!!!
3:56 about I love how you can hear a voice go “ I hear voices in my head all the time”
“Babe wake up, oversimplified posted”
Dang I loved the ending lol
Well the schooling was a bit different but we did have to learn about the Pig war going through school (I'm from WA state). Also the Hudson's Bay company lol....  Of course as an American, Canada is just holding onto our 51st territory until we decide to officially give them statehood.
0:53
That was such a good ending 😂
Or the 1990s
Can you do a video about America in the 1980s Like AIDS or the Bill Clinton affair
Eh bud, I don't like to get rude often, but I feel like that ending was a little uncalled for. Sorry
I wonder exactly how much fun oversimplified has with the voice acting
YES FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER VIDEO THE MESSIAH HAS RETURNED
i wish history class was as fun as hearing oversimplified's verson
The sus war
ukraine
That birds flying away shot @ 18:47 is very well done. Funny as hell as always, thanks.
I like how you a song 7:57
Wait till oversimplified finds out that Canadians fight with guerilla warfare for fun.
Me living in NB: I've already invaded, where's the rest?
the plushy looks likes a snowman,but in a good way.
Like the info jokes are lame
I can see why the Earthquake around New Madrid, Missouri was easily forgotten. Although the earthquake was significant, The War of 1812 replaced the fears of the natural disaster quickly.
Something sus here 5:10  I can feel it
Maybe a Mexican-American war video?
Lmaoo best ending ever
America as is right now leading the world now that's nightmare
You should do New Zealand
hey OverSimplified you really sould make a video of the ireish wars it would be really cool
If my history class was presented as entertaining as this, I could have aced it.
Lose no territory. Burn down enemies head of government's house....draw 😂
Great video, kept my attention so well I didn’t even notice it was dam near 40 minutes long until i read the comments
one of your best vids!!!
I don’t expect a new video pretty soon but a take on the scramble for Africa could be cool.
The Panama canal wasn't open during the pig war how did he send his letter through Panama?
That was the best ending i have ever seen!
I can accept the exsitence of the canadians due to their pro trump rally a while back
I watched Hey Arnold, and they explained  this theme way shorter.
Oh Oversimplified, you have outdone yourself again. YOUR VIDEOS ARE AMAZING.
This video is so far my favorite
When oversimplified uploads:
Can You Make A 7 Years War Vid ?
no canada is better you've now earned a dislike by a Canadian
Meiji restoration NEXT
Can you please do the Mexican American war please
Hey man, absolutely love your vids, been subed for a while but Iive not seen much anywhere on the war against Wales and England. It would be great if you could do the “last war of uprising” It was an uprising by the welsh between 1400 and 1415 and was led by the great, Owain Glyndwr against the Kindom Of England. It was the last major manifestation of a Welsh independence movement before the incorporation of Wales into England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. Im Welsh myself, so I’d love to see what you could do! Diolch, thanks!
I always see the Nord VPN guy as a guy with blue anime hair.
5k downvotes! .. A lotta butt-hurt American’s must be triggered by this video The British Empire will rise again !!!!! lol
he's back after half a year.
You've almost beat the rock in his sub game.
Hey, 2016 called told to return the package of humor back
Potato seeds what???
When the people are murmuring it is hilarious the background noises you give them.
-Alright, I've finish the video. -And what did you learned? -That Canada is going to fall? -What!?
Canadians: complain about representation  Oversimplified: And i took that personally
23:50 Hey that's not a wink. Cheating!
i love you dude, the way you use memes in these videos is freaking awesome
Do Spanish civil war
Not as good as the Technoblade potato war.
at the calculator part read 2318008 backwords
Do nam
He should do a video over all the wars with the Indians! Like if you agree!
Me as a Canadian watching the end getting increasingly nervous
video idea: Irish War of Independence for St. Patrick’s Day or sometime in march?🥺
well that escalated fast
he returns!
HLIAS
HLIAS
Were they really willing to go to war over a pig?  Look up "The War Of Jenkins' Ear" - yep, they were stupid enough to go to war over a pig.
I love how the pig sounds like Morgan Freeman in that flashback! XD
3:39 America?
I HAVENT SEEN YOU  IN AGES!!
its been a while!
Funny thing is I didn’t know these islands even existed until the name of one of them was explicitly said and then I realized I had been to one of them when I was like 5 and suddenly I knew who eventually got the rights to them
idea for next vid: vietnam war
Two things made my head hurt in this video.  One: That the government almost started a war over a G-Damn pig. and two: That Ending... yeah... I need to go and lay down now.
4
The goat is back
in relation to the end of this video...  as a Canadian, I would be literally OVERJOYED if America invaded Canada. Canada was a mistake on all fronts and I dont like being Canadian. Just take us out, America. Take. Us. Out.
Wtf
Oversimplified I love your content pleaser make more of these I’m only 14 but they teach me so much ♥️
Yeah
Make video of greeco turkish war or some radom vid of grecce
Who was here when it was live
That made me laugh out loud.  What a fantastic video.
7:57 i saw what you did there
That was so funny
Do the mexican american war
Biden isn't coming, he's probably sleeping lol.  If goat herders in the middle east sandbox are too much of a challenge, then frozen wasteland natives with hockey pucks wouldn't be any easier.
The big turn at the end
Philippine american war when
Whoever named this missed the opportunity to call it "The Great War of Oink Oink" Edit.1: I just assumed they spoke of the middle channel tbh.
like honestly every time you mentioned "and in true American fashion-" I just went "they used guns didn't they" "-they put up guns in their faces and told them to retreat!" "ooooof course they did.."
i love the kerbal music
They killed Waddles !!  You ask for war?!  ANNILATION
Where is the Vietnam war video?
Love these videos just sad it'll be a few months before the next one. Any chance we could get a Erwin Rommel video???
Can you do the Polish-Bolshevik war
@3:55 "It was Billy." "I thought it was Sharon's cat." "I hear voices all the time." Brilliant.
War of 1812 next I take it?
It would have been funny if the French had felt offended on the Americans part though!
the ending of this video ..... WHOA
Bruh... Florida at 3:32 woooow
You need to make mention of Canada bruh
"Over whether the US-Canada border looked like this: " [shows map of the US and Canada over all 6416 km of length until Alaska was purchased] " or this: " [Shows the identical map]. 🤣😅
he lost it by the end lol
I think I know what’s coming , Canadian independence
As a brit I will always think, Yeah come on britain beat those americans (cus of competiton ofc)
He’s Back!!  You should do Chernobyl oversimplified!
The British People: BUCHANAN! Buchanan: AHHHHH!
Dislike
bro wtf kind of micky mouse shit is this whole situation........well to be fair thats probably washington DCs response
😂
that british parlaiament was the most accurate thing ive ever seen
How in hell is it possible a brit is depicted as the villain here? To be honest, f*ck britain (due to the conspiracy to destroy the united german state, also known as "ww1"), but they always came up with a fair solution and always tried to defuse the situation, while the americans always wanted ever more land, and it was always some cheeseburger dude who nearly caused the war in the first place.
That ad transition was the best I've ever seen 😂😂
31:47 That realistic walk was frightening.
Usa usa
31:03 nobody Morgan freeman being a pig for 6 seconds
I Don't Think United States Of America Could Invade Canada Because Great Britain Promise To United States Of America Not Invade The United States Of America Country
stop putting your politics in historical videos
would you please do the mexican american war next? Please? please? BAAAAAAH?
Another Oversimplified classic!
10:32 jizzingham hehe
28:37 i like to imagine thats how buchanan was irl
Oversimplified went full Glubby Yank at the end there. Smh.
I don't really have much to add, except to say that you outdid yourself this time. Your content is brilliant.  American British relations during the American Civil war would actually make a really nice topic for a Mini Episode. It was very murky, and fairly interesting. A lot of the upper class empathized with the plantation class in the south, but much of the working class in England actually supported the Union during the Civil War especially in Hull, the home of William Wilberforce, whose widely regarded as the father of the Abolitionist movement in England, and in Manchester where there is Statue of Lincoln over the City's reaction to the Embargo (Which in itself is a fascinating story: The cotton mills in Manchester were once said to have "clothed the world" but over half of them were idle during the war as a result of the blockade. But a vote taken by workers in the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1862, agreed to risk starvation and destitution, and maintain support for Lincoln and the embargo.)  Also, insofar as the Alabama claims are concerned, the British Government were apparently unaware of the ship even being built until it had been launched, and even though the PM at the time (Lord Palmerston) was thought to sympathize with the Confederacy, Parliament as a whole were *furious*, detaining other ships destined for the Confederacy. Which is a hilarious image.  If theres one topic I'd like to a mini episode on, its on the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance: The Oldest Military Alliance in History.
I love how he said Vietnam War coming soon and its been atleast a year
i want to see technoblade comment on this
huh
This may be the best transition to sponsor message I have ever seen.
38:20 best thing ever
Every time the Americans refused something reasonable I just look on with approval and said “Good, as it should be.”
Im canadian and I thought it was so hilarious
My favourite part of the video .. The general lost it and kicked harney's ass: 33:29
Imagine if this is the thing that triggers the annexation of Canada by America.
It's "oversimplified", yet videos take around 5 months.... Amazing, keep up the good work old chap.  Ps: I'm scared to find out what a non-oversimplified video from you would be
Same
You should do a video on the history of South Africa and Apartheid
"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel." Mark 1:15
Brits bitching about being kicked out of the rest of the world
Please do alternate "what if" history videos
Manifest destiny is a prettier word for lebensraum
Oversimplified is so crazy
This was such a ridiculously good video. Entertained all the way and back.
You guys can have Canada cuz to cold 🇨🇦 .
38:12 to suggest that Biden is coming for anyone other than a minor is hilarious.
15:25🔥
When’s the Vietnam video coming?
7:59-8:04. This dude just made a poem
So can we annex Alberta now?
yo dawg, please dont speak The Invasion of Canada into existence. Thanks.
Guys here me out  Spaghetti Jeff is a time traveler, who wants to be famous and known around the world first the Italian alpps , then British Oregon he must be a time traveler I wonder where here will apear next
O canada GeT ReKt
How is it everything he uploads we are learning about this in history
The only thing former vice president biden is coming for is more bags of Depends.
Oversimplified’s accent gives him away as being rather obviously Canadian, which makes the ending that much funnier.
31:01 is the best part
Lmao that ending was just to good to be true
The anti-Canada rant at the end was gold.
Yeeeeee your backkkkk i misss thoose videos
That all star reference in minute 7:58 was noce
This was the most educational and hilarious thing I have ever watch. They should show this in schools to teach kids.
Why not snuggle: ✨ME✨
Why was the pig waddles from Gravity Falls
the spotted part is sus
Hey oversimplified, i enjoy your content and i wanted to give you a suggestion on a video you can do, it could be about the trojan war. It would be a fun video
ahahahahhaha that ending hahahahhaha canada lOOl sleep with an eye open LOol president Drake hahahahah
If USA went into war with the British Mexico could have possibly still have the territory it had back in the day
Why dont you do a mexican or eventhough a latín americano video like the Independence it would be cool as a mexican
I just love the plopping of a McDonald’s lmao
You're an absolute treasure and I appreciate you and your work. Thank you for another great video!
The ultimate lesson from this video is if you’re going to arrest an American, make sure you’re carrying a big gun.  Two, just in case.  Signed, an American.
I though it was hog riders fighting eachother
3:32 ayo america just went through puberty
37:25 then the soviets and chinese come..
"Could it, perhaps, still... invade Canada?" Nah man, I've met Americans. They think *Vermont* is too cold. Trying to invade, let alone occupy, Canada, would be like trying to take over Siberia. It'd last for like, two months in the winter, and then everyone would retire, move to Florida, and die from global warming.
Me when I see this video title: Wait... Technoblade?
Is OverSimplified's graphic's getting better?
When this guy posts nothing else is worth watching for me in YouTube.
War of the Bucket...    *REMASTERED*
14:00 Jeez! That must really hurt.
Me: *sees my favorite song in Funky Friday*  The first time I play it: *I win*  Me after the game: 31:10
You should replace crash course. Not that crash course is bad no, it’s just I like you better
that was a white lighter (20:57)
And also the Islands are now American Territory
And here I thought I knew everything about the Pig War from that episode of Hey Arnold...
Oh thus be it ever when free men shall stand between their loved homes and the war's desolation. Blessed with victory and peace may the heavens rescued lands. Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must when our cause it is just, and this be our motto: In God Is Our Trust! And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave for the land of the free and the home of the brave!
Me sleeping tonight: ;|
It said the " c e n t e r " of said channel tho....
As a canadian, can't decide whether to like the video fo a story involving us, or disliking for that ending bit. Interesting you would release this video after the dislike button change to youtube.
I hate to say it, but I think its pretty obvious that if the war did happen, British would have sided with the south, Pickette would have been jailed, and the Confederates would have both better generals and better allies.
Please make a video on Sub-continent History now India & Pakistan
FINALLY! I couldn't watch it right away, but man, as soon as it started at 0:23 my heart skipped a beat I can't describe how much I love your content
14:05 can confirm this is average and slightly under armed for an American, he must have been in a rush and forgot his rifles
Honestly, if you were to invade Canada, start with Alberta, the most American Canadian Province
16:01 American using an AK-47 in the 18 hundereds...
And yet if it wasn't for those "evil imperialist tendencies" you wouldn't have America as you know it today.  Likewise, I'm sure all those settlers who died of starvation, disease and everything would appreciate such an oversimplification of historical facts.  Then again the video is called oversimplified sooo...
your editing has gotten way better and its funny  how u made them explode 😭😭
Ending is so patriotic
30:41
Found the anti American socialist … spreading misinformation about American motivations and history. Same channel, same never ending bull crap. That’s why I never liked this channel.
"And who was it who spoke to god?"  "I hear it was Billy"  "I heard it was his cat"  "I hear voices all the time"
Literally just realized, there’s a All Star reference in this video lol
That ending is gold
It’s trending in Ireland #9
Fun fact: the White House it actually called the White House because they had to paint it white to cover up the fire  damage
"I didn't say they were white people" *Cheers* that took me OUT LMFAOOOO
Too bad Pickett went on to commit treason and join the Confederacy...I view that as a waste. An interesting point about him is that he finished bottom of his class at West Point. That would explain the folly of Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg. Asked decades later why the charge failed, he stated “I always thought the Yankees had something to do with it”. He never forgave Lee for the deaths of his men either.
Great video oversimplified,  see you in 7 months from now
"that time the French-canadian were pissed that US invaded their home and burn the White House in response"
My class was about to watch this last night but the 2 jokes in the beginning threw off the teacher
Im not even from the north american continent and the end still makes my day
It's shame that youtube didn't send me the notification of an oversimplied video.
Pigs!!
Please make more videos.
Haha🤣🤣😂😂
In the words of Alucard from Hellsing abridged... "Woops, did i accidentally a war?"
Just like akhand bharat they dreamt of akhand america 🤣
"But being an American he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife"  The most American thing ever lmao
16:29
FINNALY HE'S BACK AND WITH MERCH WWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is one of my absolute favorite videos and I already loved this channel. Well done dude, this is hilarious!
Biden wouldn't have the balls for that my friend
listen to 7:14 with your eyes closed
And Kanye West rules over Canada and the United States!!!
The line at 27:26 is just so hillarious lol. It pretty much exactly summs up how ridiculous the whole conflict is.
When America ate a burger and grew a dick, I felt that.
I wonder what happened native American after this
This is definitely the most hilarious video yet!! Loved it! And the ending 😂
Who funded the US Post Office after the war? Why is there a yellow fringe on the flag. 🤣🤣🤣
Free health care all day baby
Nord vpn is like, oversimplified’s best friend 🗿🗿
That might have been the best ending to a video I have ever seen.
OOO THIS VIDEO GOT OUT 7 DECEMBER ITS MY BIRTHDAY YAYA
Biden is coming... for your freedom babby! Let's go brandon!
Now I'm kinda grateful that I born, grow and live in a small country no one knows... 😂😂😂😂😂
YOULL NEVER WITHSTAND THE WRATH OF OUR TRAINED ATTACK BEAVERS WITH SCALDING MAPLE SURUP GUNS muHHHHHH hahahaha
This is the best episode you have ever made. Ever.
Am I the only one who caught him writing "density" instead of destiny😭💀
It's so good I wanna re-watch it
31:00 Why does the pig sound like Morgan Freeman? 🤣
Boy that sure is a pickle!
As a Canadian, I find the ending hilarious and horrifying at the same time. Lol
The ending was amazing...
Watching this makes me realize that 2020 isn't so bad after all
Is there a specific name for the audio at 21:22?
too long
We could take Canada in an hour. Tops.
lol he started singing rockstars at 7:58
BUCHANAN
The portrayal of 19th century Americans is spot on. 😂
merica baby
Don't worry Canadians. Joe Biden probably forgot where you live.
These videos keep getting better than better, the editing is perfect, that noise with Napoleon at 2:50 proves it
Ok but its time us latin americans get our history covered (from the north of Mexico to the south of argentina)
"Like rats or disease" yeah you definitely don't hate our people
5:47 wasn't expecting that transition.  you know in the fallout universe Canada was annexed by the US.
YESS I LOVE THESE
Weird conclusion but ok
5:16 I fail to see how the Americans are unreasonable for not wanting to share the river.   Yes Britian had a beaver scalping business but so did the Americans,why faver a foreign business over your own which is equally wealthy,it'd be idiotic to give that up.  It's not really "fair", the British clearly get more land out of it and better access to the pacific.  How is the Americans wanting to keep going in a strait line an act of manifest destiny? Wouldn't they just demand the whole thing? If anything the strait line plan is equal,simple,and benefits both parties.
Oh! You are alive. Nice...
Make a video on Alexander the great 🤩🤩
The way I was told that the 54-40 argument went, was that British Canada wanted all of it, and when they argued Canada proposed they get all of the land. After the US said they wanted it all, Canada was nervous and didn’t want a war, because they believed that in a war they’d be bested. Right before they backed down, the US said they’d split it across the 49th, as Americans didn’t really want the land up to the 54th, as it would be somewhat useless to Americans at that current point in time.  They agree on the 49th.
The pyschotic break at the end of this is... *Chef's Kiss*.  Keep your damn dirty hands off our maple syrup though
I love that you can clearly see Point Robert’s in wide shots throughout the video.
Blame Canada
Spotted what 🤨
Fun fact the Canadian military actually has a plan on how to fight a war with the unites states
lol so the German Empire decided. crazy
That pig actually gives me flashbacks :D
7:56, this leads to the don't stop coming reference. (made for personal use)
The end was the best dude 😂🤣😂🤣
That was good, ah! Aboot to send this to a pal of mine. Sorry for any trouble over the years.
@7:57 don't think I didn't notice you dropping into a Smash Mouth rhyme
Sums up the last 250 years for Canada, constantly getting caught in between the apathetic British Governments and the Jingoist Americans 😂 and getting the short end of the stick when it comes to the border (Alaska Panhandle, New Brunswick-Maine border) 😂. As a proud British Columbian, I was glad to see Sir James Douglas, he was an interesting man. If it did end up coming to blows over that pig (or if it still does one day) I think you Americans will get a run for your money like you always did before 😂 (Battles of Queenstown Heights, The Beaver Dams, Stoney Creek, Chrysler’s Farm and Lundy’s Lane).
I just wanna say that when I was positive COVID-19 all oversimplified video always help me go through every single days. Tq oversimplified for helping me get through that tough moment. Keep making all this fantastic videos 😊.
3:32 Florida is uhhh
Damn this was good
21:20 scheme mode lol
Let's do it! In the name of MANIFEST DESTINY  ...also, the maple 🍁 syrup is wonderful! 😝😁
That poor piggy^^
I’ve missed you
The last minute or so went from OverSimplified, to OverPoliticized, but  all in all an entertaining video.
32:20 "the British threatened to arrest this poor....pure American soul" 😂
U know, we need more obscure subjects like the Cod Wars or the fall of Soviet Union.
Loke if you came here from Drew's channel
If you wish to invade Canada let's learn about our weird history, starting with the creation of upper and lower canada and ending with  the Constitution act of 1982
finally  thanks a lot bro
Welp, this is gonna start a major global conflict
4:08 I did not expect this
Canada
The background 15:54 gives us a hint of his next video ;p
This truly is one of your best videos.
Manifest Destiny, Lebensraum,  Eh potato potato 🤷‍♂️
I could spend the next few hours just watching the last 2 minutes on repeat.
Can you do Vietnam War Oversimplified next please.
BUCHANAN!
wow finally a new vido :)
16:01 Shocked and appalled you would show an American using an AK instead of an AR-15.
His back!
So no one is going to acknowledge that OverSimplified made their own parody of All-Star?
I just love those videos
Wow! I watched a half hour video about a war that didn't happen.
anyone not talking about how he hasn't posted for half a year lol?
7:14 Wait, WHAT!?
good one
Whoa....hold on  The German's arbitrated the claim between countries over territory and AVOIDED a war?   ===== Mind blown
I love Oversimplified man, so chill
You know we burned your Whitehouse and have the best special forces in the world. I'd like to see you try...
oversimplified vietnam when
Great use of stealth bombers against the natives
THE DAY OF THE RAKE SHALL COME
Now please make a video on the OTHER pig war (Hatfields vs. McCoys)
Hey. How would you solve the issue with my silly island? You know, Puerto Rico? I bet you got an amazingly funny video :D Personally I want that 51st state thing.
Scheme Mode ! +1
I've discussed annexation with Canadians before and they said they didn't mind
shit he did a canadian manifesto
And the British Parliament didn't give a F?
VIETNAM, PLEASE!
This is one of the best oversimpilfied video ever!
7:57 Is it just me or is it like Oversimplified is rapping or singing because of those rhymes hahahaha
Everyone talking about the pig, spudy or the invasion of Canada but no one talking about how Oversimplified slipped a Smash Mouth reference in the video
You got the wrong song OVERSIMPLIFED for Biden. It's not the American song for Biden since many Americans despise Biden, but probably the Chinese national anthem song since Lefties support communism.
“They met in Paris”  Who’s in Paris?
Computers didn't exist that day lol
It’s always a good day when oversimplified posts
its interesting, because if the succession war happened anyways, if the US had tried to invade Canada and brought England into the war, it might have brought France in as well, which even if that could tie up most British troops in Europe, the US would still find itself fighting on 2 fronts, over a huge amount of territory, with an enemy within striking distance of its capital and another chewing up its south. You might then see a Southern victory in the US civil war, maybe Spain would take the opportunity to take back some of its lost land too through Mexico
Hey oversimplified talk about Denmark next
Nice Star Wars thumbnail
!
Technoblade approved
Eat your cereal
31:00 That Morgan Freeman Voice XD
Another Great video on a horrible schedule !
america: I dont want an empire uk: son, you're just like me
FINALLY!
USA and British North America: The issue of the border has been resolved, and it will never come up again!  Narrator: A few years later, it came up again.
0:31 whats the background music name? it sounds awesome tho.
Mto bom
that'll do pig, that'll do.
On the speech at the end I could hear General Scott screaming: Harney!!!!
BRAVO!!!! standing applause
Oversimplified: Why not buy my plushie for a cheap price? Me: Well that would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interest of both parties... My bank account: AND THERE'S NOT WAY I'M AGREEING TO THAT
OMGGG YESSS THE LEGEND IS BACK 🥳🥳🥳
37:20 u need copium, dude
As great as this video was, some small parts didn’t feel like oversimplified, but it was still great
Just imagine, the end of this video is the start of the invation of Canada and during the invation Drake replaces Biden as president lol :)  God bless you Oversimplified, you made my day again and again and again :)
For your next video could you do the Mexican american war or the Texas revolution
21:31 I don't think you can talk through a banana and iron
Please do the yugoslav wars
Video ideas! The war between Pakistan and India. And the soviet afghan war.
37:16 why we should invade canada
please make a video about the GREAT DEPRESSION
We kicked you guy's ass 😂
Finally he can be the second most famed pig of all time, first being technoblade.
Viewers:  “…….Fallout 1?” “Fallout 1”
It wouldn’t even surprise me is that dumbass evaded or allies
Bruh
Typical Americans thinking the war of 1812, CANADA WON BABY
Lol you should definitely invade Canada. But remember, then the Chinese will occupy Alaska, and although you bring the war to their soil, somebody will press the button and then you will have to make videos in the world of Fallout:P Btw, why you said Biden is coming? I thought Trump said that he won the rigged elections...?:P
I loved this video ❤
Now thats nationalism
Oversimplified is the only dude Eminem is afraid to diss.
I was convinced at the end till you mentioned Biden. He's so far gone he won't even know where Canada is to invade it.....
Can you do Yugoslavia wars
Drake the type of fella to end up in an oversimplified video
This was the funniest in a while. Perfect!
7:57 Is anyone going to point out that he subtly sung All Star
You should post more often
This is a golden video of youtube
eh what now canadian war
I think that an Oversimplified take on The Swedish Empire would be kind of awsome, since it did affect both the Great Northern War and the Thirty Years war. And it's also a great reminder that one should NEVER invade Russia during winter...
do the Korean War next
Why was there so many ads
That ending- lol
Who's idea was it for the Germans to mediate ? I mean it's not like they don't love to get one over on the Brits.
What a masterpiece!
31:03 best moment
Biden is too dumb to command our army in an invasion of Canada.
As a Brit I can confirm that 10:23 is exactly how our parliament functions.
'So you see, General.'  I'm getting Dhar Mann vibes.
EVERY POST A BANGER
To the netherlands
Pig
as a canadian that ending litterly scared me
33:05 the funniest part
That was the best add intro yet. Smooth.
Google maps says it’s american
This voice...
Ngl I would totally invade Canada
I have one word GREAT
That escalated quickly at the end there
Unpopular opinion: This video had highest quality till now but  The content was shitty  Well not shitty  Jokes were the best but if it was vietnam war or chinese civil war we would have chosen them over this   You know its been 6 months since napoleon video  And I got goosebumps both times   Once when napoleon was fighting with his troops and when he ordered a death charge to cross the bridge   Second when king said his men to arrest him the soldiers started crying and celebrated his return   So I was highly anticipating that kind of content  But the idiot pig ruined it
The theme and term 'Manifest destiny' existed before the acts. Just letting you know. It was all planned.
US-eh?
Can you make a video on the Greek rebellion of 1821?
Imagine being his neighbors and you suddenly hear a man screaming about wanting to invade Canada at 3 a.m in the morning
The space race!You didn't say anything about the space race in the animation of the cold war so maybe if you want you can make my idea!
I got an idea for the next Oversimplified animation!
YES ANOTHER VIDEO
The prospect of president Drake is what sold me on the US invading Canada. Anything that detours Drake from making music is a good idea.
But why
I'm embarrassed to say how excited I was to see a new video
Oversimplified: Finally includes Canada in his videos Also Oversimplified: Makes a huge joke about America taking over Canada I find that so funny lol
Promoting war eh? canceled           lol
he uploaded
thats not a rat its a GERBIL!
ah yes, our glorious president, Drake.
Fear not dear Canadians, Biden is still thinks he’s a senator.
Breaking News: a man going by the name of “Oversimplified” and his 5.7 million subscribers have invaded Canada.
imagine next video would be about the scramble of Africa, that would be cool
...If Canada not choose to arrest Huawei CEO
Hey make a video on carnatic wars of India
In 1834, Harney was run out of St Louis, where he was stationed, by a mob  when he beat  one of his slaves to death with his cane. He spent a year on the lam and in 1835 came back to face the music from the Army.  He suffered no legal or military punishment and even kept his rank of Major.
Britan won the war of 1812 and by that i mean Canada did
Can you please do a video on the Partition of India
7:58 straight fire
27:29 bruh i could not catch the difference first
5:19 Damn OS getting good at shouting!
"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead"   "So the Americans kept on coming and they don’t stop coming  They got in their wagons and hit the ground running  Didn’t make sense to share Orego  Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb"
Nah Biden died
I love your channel I don’t know why I haven’t subscribed I will now!!
3:54 I thought it was Sharon’s cat?
6:21 After he said "bts" me(an army):😳
dont give them ideas wtf
Noooooo I'm lateeee
16:27 and 7:26
Joe Biden: The time to invade and annex Canada has come! We must do it! It’s part of our manifold dest-, manifes-, destined something, ...you know....the thing.
Sharon’s cat spoke to god, yup sounds good to me
do't do you do it
Could you do the crusades?
great vid i think the best one so fasr the end was amusing
Best. Video. EVER!
Why so much white people hate? I get jokes and all but it gets too much at times, is it intended to be so offensive? I’m not even English nor American
man i love this
cool vid
5:45  Smooth
4:10 This is so funny tbh I can't stop-
0:31  mmmm russia
I think what's really fun is that this story is so essential to understanding America yet the one barely taught growing up
HE RETURNS!!!!
So let's go get Canada!
Shut up USA
Bro why are you stop doing Animation in 6 month
and you get an upvote for referencing the best Ryan Reynolds movie with Winfield Scott...
That escalated quickly
As a Brit, I found this one of the most interesting videos on YouTube… very funny, I don’t think any Brit hate Americans enough to go to war, so glad the troops had a party.
You're the 🐐
I am from Poland.
The US and Canada are both part of NATO and are allies
Try the yugoslav wars
The most worrying thing is that he is probably true...
Down with their Metric system and really good actors and comedians.
I love this vid so hallal mode
make a vid abt the indian history pls oversimplified
He's back :-D 1:23 and more about your own curves, Benjamin.
Dude can you do video about georgia plz 🇬🇪🇬🇪
1:20
7:57
I am scared to gogle "Spotted dick" cause ik what will most likely pop up but i wanna know wth it was...
That ending got me
here goes another 6 months of wait
The second casualty of the war was the potato
How Mr. Oversimplified started the US-Canada war, coming to you in... 2035.
Drake 2024!
domuz yedim hocam
I will avoid NordVPN because you mentioned BTS.
ahh my new favouite channel
The Winfield Scott attacking Harney was the funniest thing I have seen in a while.
If you look back in history most of the wars should not happen and was irrational.
“Because Biden’s coming, baby. And this time, he is coming, with a vengeance!!!!!!”  Oversimplified 2021
This is by far your worse video. Filled with wokeness, self loathing and cheese jokes. You lost a viewer in me. Focus on the history and not mainstream political fluff
"...to multiply and spread across the continent, like rats or disease." BTW have you got vaccine'd for COVID, oversimplified?
I’m so happy for each video that drops 😭
28:06 OverSimplified- Baynes culd've kissed hi,m, wether he did or not, history doesn't tell Me- 🤣
But Oversimplified, the British and the Americans didn't occupy St Juan Islands, *the Vikings did !*
Loved The All-Star cover
Canadian troops waiting with allied forces and the un on the other side of the border 🙄🙄
Can you do Yugoslav war pls🙏
It's an American Archipelago nowadays. The End
i like how you are so suprised about a war for some stupid islands when greece and turkey did the same for some rocks.................
LETS GETTIM, CAMERICA
3:52. Who was it that spoke to God? "It was Billy, right?" "I though it was Sharon's cat" "I hear voices all the time"
At least the pig killer tried  saying sorry
After watching this, I realised I had been manifasting destiny in the toilet for half an hour now.
Ha! Ha!  Someone said to me when I was a kid that the US war of independence was fought to gain real estate like you said.  The founding farthers according to them although extolled as being upright had slaves and black mistresses who were forced and kept in inhumane conditions and Washington who was deemed virtuous by not lying about cutting the cherry tree lied and betrayed his king. The constitution although was moral did not include people of color and the natives of the land.  Well that is what they said....Dunno if it is true at all.
Whenever OverSimplified uploads,  i get more lifespan
hold up.... why do i suddenly have the urge to build a space rocket at 12:28..... lol
Oversimplified, that speech in the end was HILARIOUS 🤣 Your videos are so sick !!  Love from Germany 💙
Sengoku Period plzzzz
Head canon is Black Sabbath's War Pigs, is in fact, a commentary on the Pig War.
Could you do a video about the Spanish civil war ?
The ending was the definition of someone on crack 🤣 keep it up
If you ask Americans why are they taking over North America, there answer is:  we are manifestly destined to it, (there is no way we made this up to justify a ruthless collective imperialist tendencies)
Me and my classmates watched this in U.S. History and lol these animations are great
7:57 But the Americans keep coming, And they don’t stop coming. Hopped in theirs wagons, And they hit the ground running. Didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon. When they outnumber the Brits, More than six to one!
Finnally  another vid
Holy shit mr O calm down
Bruh I’m in Scotland this is so sad
I think this way is the only way I support sudden advertising in a video. Congrats, OverSimplified!
Can you do war of 1812
Great, now just gotta wait another 6 months for the next one  🙃
"I floop the pig"
33:29 Deserves way more attention
But how about I am Chinese ?
You should cover the 80 years war. Aka the Dutch Rebellion. It's extremely funny and interesting. A view examples. There was this one time the Dutch beat the Spanish while fighting on ice-skates. And there's this one time the French cavalry defeated the Dutch navy on frozen ice. And this time The Dutch took a city hiding in a boat filled with supplies (wooden horse of Troy style). And this time the Dutch had their first victory on the first of April, which was so surprising the whole first of April thing started. Also, the Dutch invented Capitalism in the Middle of the war. It's honestly such a fun topic to cover.
YEEHAW
If you were curious about all the bison killing, well that was a thing they actually did. It was to lower the native tribes main food supply, in order to wipe them out quicker.
Is it just me or these video even more cringy ?
A simp channel with lefty views. Am I not surprised 💀🤦🏽‍♂️
You are really using your animation game! I was thoroughly entertained good sir.
FINALLY a new video 😁
That yeeee haa was so OP
5:53
You could make a musical out of this
I wouldn’t worry about Oversimplified’s American invasion of my home country. Don’t mess with our Geese battalions, lest you know God’s hideous wrath.
Throughout the video, I just couldn’t wait for it to end, just to know what happened to those islands I never heard about in my entire life.   Let’s say I got more than I expected.
I’m scottish
This vid made my brain ded becuase of the map.
Is this where the book award comes from
W
How long was it before he uplouded
One of the best videos I’ve seen in a while
This upload is a real holiday gift 😍😍😍
31:00 WHAT THE ACTUAL FICK 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can you please make the Turkish war of Independence
Expand war. Like Rats or Disease 🤣🤣🤣 Yes!
Plss oversimplified zulu war
Not one of your better videos. Very slanted against the USA.
Oversimplified 2022- How I started a war.
What’s the song that plays during the American manifestation?
U should do an animation on the 80 years war
The tale of Technoblade
I actually flipped when I heard the pig start speaking like Morgan Freeman. Lol thanks for linking the voice Charlie Hopkinson in the end
7:25 can someone tell me what anthem this is thanks! :D
Best thing I've watched in ages.
USA will split apart if anything
me and the boys bout to time travel back to the 1850's to steal orca's island.
Straight line? Straight line
-When you root for the US to fail-
If the USA invaded Canada Joe Biden and Trudeau would definitely have a one on one anime ark ending death battle
Lmao I love being ebony and being able to 100% enjoy this... 0:47 🤣🤣
2:24 Brilliant, pick a fight with your neighbor, get YOUR ass kicked on YOUR side of the lawn, call time out, then later tell your kids it was pretty much a tie. It's the American way.
the ending was very emotional
Yattaaaaa 6:04
God I loved that ending, as a Canadian, 10/10
These are the only video in the entire YouTube universe that I don’t watch and read the comments at the same time. NEVER!!. Every single second matters 🙈😲😜🤣🤣🤣🤣 then rewatch it while reading the comments! And it is double fun
You make the best videos on YouTube! Well done
Wtf happened to this Channel so
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I thought he was ded lol
Gotta admit, i laughed when Griffin sticked that badge on the hawaiian shepherd
7:57 I just heard All-Stars in that one
.
This is good
ISRAELI-ARABIAN WARS🇮🇱🇦🇪🇮🇱🇦🇪🇮🇱
clearly should've just given the territory to mexico
Historians in the future will unanimously agree that this was the cause of world war three. Because some YouTuber said we should invade Canada
Love these man
That is the smoothest transition to an sponsor
Will you make video about Russian-ottoman war?
the fact the he mentioned bts...
Make video of winter war
4:03 is the funniest part of the video other than the ending!
Hi
I am your big hidro fan 😂
What About Any Video On Indian History 😊 . Please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
You should make a video about the Vietnamese War and the Korean War
Watching Harney get belted had me belted
“I didn’t say they were white people” is the stupidest most revisionist history I’ve seen since the 1619 project.
Glorious ending
I'm Canadian, should I be concerned?
"enhance frame, 200%" LOL
So America has always been greedy
yay finally
The end of the video was funny.......... If it was written with trump as president. I'd expect the general theme would be rather different 😅.  It's probably worth noting. That even today, I could see the royal navy defending the sovereignty of a commenwelth state to the last man and missile. Wouldn't it be ironic after the cold war, the middles east crises, India and Pakistan and north Korea entering the nuclear club.... What actually ends humanity is a nuclear winter caused by an ICBM exchange triggered by a war between the British commonwealth nations and the United States in America...  That, would be uncool
We still need 1812 and 7 Years
This channel desurves to be the most subbed on YouTube. ❤
I've been waiting!
ảo ma Canada là có thật
7:30 Spotted what?!
Spotted what?!
Yankee go home
Hey like if you agree he should do the, VIETNAM WAR!!!!!
fkn brilliant
Both American and British (Canadian) speak English, and both are same white people. So how did they claim themselves as an American or a British? There were no ID card at that time.
The return of the king!
I love as he made his speech about invading canada his mic cut out from how loud he was yelling
CANADA ITS YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE  AMERICA IS COMING!!
Wayne Gretzky waving and American flag is in my nightmare list now
Can you upload about Middle East conflict?
Mm hmm what about india
pleaseeeeeee, invade us. i beg you. pleaseeeee
Bro u good man? You also forgot the 15 warheads that were stolen by candice
We have the men power we sent more power and money in our amry we have the needed men we can do it let us go and see canda and take it over it now the US let gooooooo
So you're American, ey?
You've definitely gone too far into crazy land, this time. Are you sampling the mushrooms? The wild mushrooms that these islands have become famous for? Going native? 😳 Sure sounds (and looks) like it.
Can you like do a video bout greece ive been wanting it for years
It's like the more videos he makes the more comfortable he becomes and there's more emotion in his voice, or just less monotone or stilted
21:26 I, too, like to use banana phones. Much cheaper than Apple
:Oversimplified: Don't blame the founding father's they we're just using the best map possible.  :Me: I agree. :Oversimplified: Blame the guy who made it :Me: I forgive who ever made it.
33:29 *SCOTT BURSTS DOWN DOOR* General Scott: ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH IVE BEEN WAITING YEEAAARS FOR THIS   (chases down Harney while holding a belt) General Scott: (starts beating Harney) *I HATE YOU!!! IVE ALWAYS HATED YOU!!!!!*
Finally
OMG. It’s finally hereee!!!!!
I’m Canadian 😂
7:58 - 8:02 am i the only one who recognized this joke?
Alternative Title: The Technoblade War
Can you make a video on the haitian revolution or spanish civil war
oversimplified ITS AMERICA'S DENSITYYYYYYYYYYY
That pig looked damn fine in that dress.
Finally! A new video.
I first heard Pickett and thought it was Pickett from his charge but after hearing how dumb he was I didn’t think  he could be the confederate general. I’m shocked that it was actually him. Also wth was that ending. I support the invasion of Canada. MANIFEST DESTINY!!!
I mean, really, think about it, if the crisis had actually led to an armed conflict it could possibly lead to UK taking direct action in the coming civil war, that could maybe have changed the tide of war and the outcome, that could've led to today US being divided in 2 or maybe several independent states instead of one big chunk. Man that would've been a fun timeline ngl
“I didn’t say they were white people” I- what
I am rolling
When I saw the title "The Pig War" I immediatelythought of 86 Eighty-Six
What was that last part though.
Given that the US has actually attempted to fuck with canada, twice, in the past.. And both times wound up with the white house being burnt down, despite the parliament buildings being nearly on the border..  .... Yeah I ain't worried bout no invasions man, not sorry.
U should do The roman empire
Okay, that last part, I didn't expect it
I bet if general Harney was alive today he would be friends with Biden.......you know seeing as they are both self serving idiots.
Now I know how Harney county in Oregon got its name.  Also, I feel it is pretty obvious the Germans made the correct ruling.
I didn't know that Pickett was THAT Pickett!  Love your work!
can you PLEASE do one on the irish revolution
LEEEE POGGGGG WARRR
Stuart, I still wonder why dont you make vietnam war vid -_-
Babe wake up, oversimplified just posted a new video
this video is so american I gained 20 kilogra... imperial pounds while watching it.
Well third time's the charm. Plan Red for the win.
Just so you know a lot of us Canadians like to say that we burned down the white house in 1812
Why were the Germans suddenly asked 😂
If this is how you're gonna treat Canadian history.... We're gonna need more
All I can say was that was absolute perfection. 👓
37:16 Please dont give them Ideas
Harney sounds like a typical American
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG IN YOUR BRAIN!!!!
Jizzingham
Bruh I was eating cereal while watching this. It was to funny😂😂
DRAKE FOR PRES
Canadians when they see more Americans than usual: *Chuckles* "I'm in danger"
Ok oversimplified
lake of the woods great walleye fishing
BIDEN ALREADY MESSED UP ASIA, SO THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN MESS UP. NOW ONLY THING HE SHOULD DO NOW IS HELP 🇹🇼 TAIWAN
Why is this video trending in Canada? Love it!
Yo, chill with the Canadian part man, chill okay?
That was a a good sagway
Took you way too long!!!
kick mcellan in the shins lol
18:45
griffin looks like valterri bottas
If you like this comment oversimplified was drunk when Biden wanted revenge
where is my amogus
Welcome back after a 6 months duration
Oh God I'm a Canadian and this video is very interesting especially the end lol
It would be very cool if you did a video on German unification
Vietnam War? When?
Why it is called the pig war
Wait wait go back to that President Drake thing that's got some potential
Finaly new vid:)
that ending i loved it
maple syrup are really yummy. how american.
27:28 you can actually see the islands change color if you look closely... only they change early
Why do these videos take 4 months to make
OVERSIMPLIFIED PLS MAKE A TEXAS REVOLUTION: OVERSIMPLIFIED PLSSSSSSSSSSSSS
37:11
Damn, that ending
Over simplified is so funny that's why I love watching his videos😂😂😂
as someone with the exact same lake in the pfp as the one showed for banff and having a red and white shirt that says canada in big letters on the front, i speak for my entire country when i say just you try, eh?  also why have a war when we can just have a hockey game in its place
Ayyy the Drizzy Drake shout out!!! 🔥🐐
Do the Winter War Next
the Morgan Freeman pig absolutely killed me lmao
Okay we all agree oversimplified needs more videos 😂
At 7:25 what song is that
🤣🍺
Hi :)
Yo don't talk about Canada like that
Maybe the real disputed Islands were the friends we made along the way.
This is such a high quality video, filled with so much great jokes
36:57
Man, I love this channel like the dude loved his pig.
It is Haro Strait so the islands are American
Or the great northern war video
Based ending
The pig sounded like Morgan Freeman!
We need a Chinese civil war video
The Florida penis was definitely purposeful lol
The transition to Nord VPN was so clean.
People in Alabama: let me draw a family tree  Result: straight line  sweet home Alabama
Biden couldn't come, even if he tried hard.
Oversimplified is GOATED
I knew south park was on to something😂
he is back :)
6:30
So what I’m hearing is that after the Revolutionary War it took… oh, I don’t know… 10 seconds for it to become the very thing it swore to destroy.
BEST ENDING EVER
To Mr. Oversimplified I  I would like it if you would feature the Republic of India for at least 1 episode.  Yours sincerely,  Valsala
Lol! That took a big turn haha
31:16 dhar mann reference??
Are you sure this channel is called "Oversimplified"? No joke, this legitimately was more detailed than most of my eighth grade school textbook chapters.
would have voted for biden if he promised to invade canada
I realized that Speedy the Potato was wearing Sonic the Hedgehog's shoes.
I hate that I found this channel so early on in it's life. Now I have to wait for new videos. This is the type of channel I would binge 300 episodes of no problem.
Like video
that plushie is the new belle of the ball
An instant classic. You get better at your craft every video, kudos!
My good....All those American accents and behaviour was hilarious
By far some of the best content on YouTube, what I'd give to learn world history in a hip teachers class that shows this as subject material.
At this point OverSimplified is only going to accept sponsors from NordVPN.
14:23
1:25
I hope makes someone makes a loop of the "Your an Idiot" scene at 32:30
“I didn’t say they were white people” has me in TEARS 😂
the next oversimplified video will be on the vietnam war, im calling it. i saw that map in the border drawing room, you cheeky man
POV Oversimplified had about up to here with the Canadians
Guess whos back baby!!! Thanks for your work making us entertained and educated at once
Thanks to this dude I pass the revolutionary war test 💪😎👍
I love how he wrote voice of the pig below Charlie's name lol
Do a Mexico and American war next’s
I laughed A LOT during this video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The heck man,  that ending was epic 😂
I read many comments about the war against canada. Guys there are more wars comming earlier than this one, so please respect where everyone stands and wait.  PS: I think Germany did a bad job about the line where it goes. Talk about that.
Straight line? Straight line.
Hey, who wants to turn to Jesus and live for him and obey everything he says? This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18) or that if you believe in God then you're Good which isn't true. But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit.  Do any of you need prayer?  d
20:00 Wait.. what? This is more controversial than “Are people that use TikTok mentally handicapped?”
7:12 “Now tell me what you want, what you really really want!”  “The Territory of Oregon”
That whole Canada rant was amazing.
anti-canadians be like.
If you can find people who are willing to animate these just like how you do it you can start a whole business on this youtube channel (im not an expert but im just tryna help)
As a Minnesotan, the whole Lake of the Woods debacle is hilarious. The tiny nub of Minnesota sticking up into Canada, totally cut off from everything, I never knew how it got there
7:56
Please do  indian 🇮🇳  revolution plz, from India
Wouldn’t american Mounties just be snow cowboys
This is a masterpiece. Were I American and were this video my cousin, I’d marry it.
u should do a vid on maybe saddam hussien or idi amin cuz u know u did a vid on hitler
Up until the Biden part I thought everything was good. At least Trump can say he almost got us Greenland.
I am just waiting for the Canadians. Friendly as Always. To start Thanking him for Finally mentioning them and talking about them that much..... ^^
My question is how Harney and Pickett weren't dishonorably discharged.
The return of the king
can you please make a video about the new zealand wars? i really enjoy your videos!
11:56
YEAH, AMERICA DID HAVE A CLAIM TI THE ENTIRE REGION, I CAN CONFIRM IT
Oversimplified blessed my birthday with a new post
Come and get us yankee
6 minutes in and I already want to give him a Ginus Award. Also LOVE everything about this guy.
Yo, Texas turned yellow then blue
This alert always a nice treat. Feels like it’s always just around the time I’m ready for and expecting an Oversimplified video, there it is.
that speech at the end was beutiful
Being Canadian, that last part....kinda got me
as a canadian i laughed so hard at the end part lol and i mean this could totally happen
Let’s goooooo
Irish war of independence
I mean the brits went to war over some dumb islands after this incident so…
The transition to nord vpn was so smooth
I don't say this lightly. This might just be your best.
The end of this video made me spew my chocolate milk out my nose in five different languages
Alright, you've convinced me. We need to take Satuma Island by force, it is clearly on our side of the straits. Also, manifest destiny forever!
the final part of the video made me do the salute to the american flag
Hey i know that pig he farmed 500 million potatoes
when is the vietnamese war vid coming out i'm so excited for that
a Draw? The US had a massive population and couldn't take Canada as the Canadians (upper and lower) fought.. the US lost that war. You invade a country and gain no ground you lost :P
Man, how I wish the British had prevailed and the Columbia was the border.   It only makes sense.  "Like rats."   -- "Or disease."    ---nailed it.
20:55 General Harney literally looks like that Hide-the-pain-Harold meme...
To be honest I would start a war If one of my pet chickens was shot
37:10: broke 37:18: Baroque 37:28: WOKE
Babe wake up new OverSimplified just dropped
I love how these videos doesnt get boring and is fun at the same time.
It's the technoblade war
I flipping love this guy
do the roman empire
Im from Canada and that...  Dosent scare me at all
Indians lost the war. Deal with it. They were warring with themselves for thousands of years. It's just war.
If your videos were 3 hours long I'd watch them from start to finish!
It seems Oversimplified has been on a downward spiral mentally and I think he's close to losing it completely.
The ending of this video was cringe  But thanks for the history lesson that's actually funny just like every video i've watched for past 2 years hahaha
A VIDEO.. POG!
16:28
Yeah. Go for it 'murica! Get rid of trudette! (and find a way to correct the flawed 2020 election in the US)
Been waiting literally forever for your new video :D Love them all.
You'd be an amazing history teacher. Just what kids like cartoons and no boring overexplaining.
LOL, 33:33 when Scott beats Harney for disobeying orders.
I think this is your best work, so far. Congratulation man.
"Grandpa why did America go to war with Canada?" "Well Billy, there was this YouTube video..."
Damn, I was one reasonable compromise away from being canadian... TT_TT
I love when he comes out with a new video until I realize I’m going to have to wait 6 more months for a new one. But ill probably end up watching all of his videos 5 times over by that point
31:37 the pig looks like al capone
I'ma rewatch all of them
I love your vids :D
What are your sources
People from Canada what should we deal with this guy?
When he started talking about invading Canada at the end, I thought he was going to plug some mobile game about world domination
You should make a video about afganistan
That ending 😂😂😂 Great video as always 👍🏾
32:31 pretty much explains it all
Why the heck did they name that island San Juan? I literally thought this whole thing happened in PR lol
It took the unification of Germany to solve this problem
he finally covered my favorite war
14:36
Norm MacDonald would be so proud. Canada have had it too good for too long.
Its gonna be a good day when oversimplified posts :)
That's the fastest potato alive
Best damn ending in YouTube history!  Also maybe it's just me, but I heard plankton saying it all it.
Ah yes, my forefather at his finest. Awesome videos, love the channel!
tell me these episodes don't get better with each subsequent release.
Wasn't expecting an anthropomorphic potato with Sonic shoes
using the nordvpn logo as the hair is fking genius
Oh come on I missed the release of this
Love that end part
37:19 oversimplified turns into an ace combat character
I'd rather snuggle the real thing UwU
The return of the king
Is no one gonna talk about the Morgan Freeman moment 31:00 😂🤣
So Canada WHATCA gona do when USA runs wild on YOU
dude.   the u.s. invasion of canada was supposed to be a surprise for their birthday.   now you ruined it.    jerk.
Liked it but why the old senile creepy guy at the end?
32:15 you guys are fine moment
38:09 One eye open when im sleepin~ oNe EYEYEyeYEEYEYeyE~
Kings uploaded:D
I want that plusshhy now
You never talk about North Carolina 😣
I love how oversimplified’s humor has evolved
What an absolute negative and cynical view of what really happened. This channel isn't even history anymore. It's SNL.
You should make a video on the Cherokee-American war
Kerbal music
Beautiful
man just made a 30 min video on a war about pigs...           god what has entertainment become...🤦‍♂
I show the ending to my sandwich and it turned into a Big Mac
7:57 lmao best reference in the video
31:03 why did the pig turn into Morgan freeman
Talks about invading Canada and making it American territory Hitler: Now you get it
Brits: BUCHANAN  Buchanan: OHOHOHOHOH
This is by far the best quality video yet! Super entertaining!
Canadians when they watch the end of the video: *TRIGGERED*
37:09 Oversimplified 2024
I never thought I could be made so mad about something that happened so long ago. Canada should have absolutely have gotten San Juan Island if not all the islands.
Someone jumped the shark!
Wat
The fuck were you on???
Pig: lyman i will give three wishes if you spare me  Lyman: Pig go boom
12:38 is the funniest moment of the video
This is truly the most American thing ever when they said let's get out there and make the world a better place
Um, ok first of all, I’m a Canadian and I dislike the idea of the US invading Canada, second of all, ur a bum! Ooooh get “rekt”
As a Canadian can I just say  Please invade us and rename Canada  “North Texas”
Le king hadeth come back :)
5.69 mil subs sheesh    but the 69 part
5.3 Million people would be better off listening to The Dollop XD
Can you do the Korean War pls?
7:57 *when oversimplified wants to copy all star and doesn't want to get copyrighted*
We see people die all the time in these videos from soldiers to civilians but over simplified censors the pigs death lol
😃😂 I miss these videos!
When are we getting Vietnam war?
Those poor, poor Beavers 🦫. They only want to be happy and start a great life with a family.
4:10
Did Buchanan perfectly
I can’t believe it’s been since June since I want one of these! I laugh so hard when I watch them. Great job! Looking forward to next one!
I'm a Canadian on the BC coast and I can confidently say you may have won the War of the Pig. But you will never win the War of the Geese. Have at thee.
BAHAHAH PUMPED A DOUBLE BARREL
the ending is just amazing
Canada got a firm slap in the nuts there...
That one British guy that roasted benjy 😂😂😂😂
That was amazing. Thank you.
31:03 Morgan Freeman? Nooo surely I mishear right?
wtf was that last segment i just watched
What a plot twist, German arbitration. And a funny ending too.
You should do the Spanish inquisition
This is what I’m learning in class and I took a test on the 1812 war not knowing what it was… I should’ve watched this video when it came out
Am i the only one thinking the last bit was an intro to an ad?
This is what I’m learning in class and I took a test on the 1812 war not knowing what it was… I should’ve watched this video when it came out
3:51 "I hear voices in my head all the time" had me laughing real good.
I’m pretty sure OverSimplified kinda lost his sanity in the end
I was watching and at 33:48 the video cut from “Harney was still threatening…” and then an ad came and it said little caesers pizza😂
Do the history of Rome!
i wanna fall into a coma for 8 years so i'd have 9 new OverSimplified Videos to watch
i never actually heard him scream before
The quality of this is through the roof
We should invade Canada!
Wow you really went overboard with this one, 38 minutes of high quality. I really appreciate the amount of work you put in your video.
I will never look at the map the same again
what the heck I just watched?
As a Canadian, I didn't mind if oversimplified didn't talk about Canada enough
Is it bad I didn’t recognize picket until he talked about pickets chargw
On San Juan island, the British camp is a cool place to explore. Highly recommend it
31:03 is my favorite part, the way the pig just stands up and turns into a porcine Morgan Freeman always gets me.
Was that Morgan Freeman or am I going crazy
As a resident of these (Not Canadian) islands, I can say with certainty that Porky and Spuddy were secretly having an affair when Lyman caught them, and killed both in a rage. Both American Camp and English Camp are still standing and are a part of the National Parks, and they're very pretty. Also my only critique is the pronunciation of San Juan. A little less Spanish, gotta whitewash it a bit more. Less Hwahn, more Wahn.
at 3:58 one of the people said "well i hear voices all the time" and i dont think enough people are talking about that
I wont more this contrnt
31:02 a double barrel doesnt make that sound :O  cool vidoe though
Eh, American Maple syrup doesn't have the same ring to it.   Really dumb conflict though.
Pls do Vietnam u said comming soon remember
Feels like a Minecraft-style skirmish ngl
lets see some australia up in here
Day 1 of asking for a Ben Franklin biographical Oversimplified.
If only I had this video for social studies
As a Canadian this was by far your funniest/best video EVER keep it up my dude!
Honestly the Pig War has the plot of a Coen brothers movie.  Now I want them to make a movie out of this.
Can you do French revoulution
you mean Brandon is coming  HOW DARE YOU!!!
Some Guy: Woah, I didn’t say they’re white men! *World history summed up*
It's MY "DENSITY" 3:37
7:57 Love the All Star reference there.
Fo fucks sake man. It's midnight . You can't to this to me .
Love oversimplified videos ❤️
*MOLE MOLE MOLE MOLE*
I’d love to see the Balkan wars so I know what led up to WW1
37:20 based
10:27 Teacher when the class gets to loud over their class president election:
I think that he just deklared war on Canada
The last part of the video was pure gold XD
Lmfaooo they tried to get the customs guy and he came out the tent with the guns on deck lmaoo. Most American thing ever.
31:52 Did he just pump a double barrel shotgun?
*cough*  NATO??????? America and Canada are in nato
So the moral of the story is people are stupid.
Where the Vietnam war at ☹️
If I was a high school history teacher, I’d show this. Maybe get fired but at least they learned something for once.
This was so good but in my opinion the guy who shot the pig is in the right
Hey oversimplified any chance of a irish 1916 rising vid?
I feel like if The US invaded Canada, they might succeed, only to be fought back and forced to retreat by the wildlife (moose etc) and inclement weather.
WHAT  A  VIDEO
This should be called "The Beaver War"  it all started from those damn beavers...
lol haha me being canadian
Up yours Canadians and your complaining comments lol.
naw mate we need Canada to stay the same way. Without Canada, the first letters out of each country in North America wouldn't be a inside joke anymore
See America, you've always been like this.
Canadians: You made us look dumb!  Oversimplified: Pulls out guns
7:57 I couldn't stop laughing at this part LOL
i feel like oversimplified had a lot of fun voice acting this time around
It’s that time again when oversimplify wakes up from hibernation and uploads
I love that Shrek song reference haha
You have really outdone yourself with that ending. Lets invade canada. Hell i am not even amarican.
yoooo they named a war after your mom
yo, found u on a Ludwig stream and u actually make some good content :D
Buchanan😡🤣
Yoooo you're finally back
HEY!!! I’m Canadian…
Somebody once told me the Yanks were gonna roll me I ain't about to cede the Northwest
Dang oversimplified sounded so evil and so vengeful
Piggy
Ok, 4:10 made me lol XD
The war of 1812 was not a draw. One side wanted to take Canada the other wanted to keep Canada. Is Canada part of the US?
Ohh no eh
WAKE UP BABE OVERSIMPLIFIED JUST UPLOADED A NEW VIDEO
just give the island to San Juan
A masterpiece. 🇨🇦✌️
BRUH atleast we won the war of 1812
Thank you that was… beautiful 🥲
I watched the latest vid and and oldest vid in oversimplified's channel, man his voice went low low
I am gonna be the level headed American here and say that is a terrible idea that could result in global war
I love it once he puts a vid it gets mega viral really cool
Everything in this video lined up until you said Biden would invade Canada with a vengeance. I don’t think he knows where Canada is, let alone how to spell vengeance.
18:46 R.I.P Peppa
I know about this madness because Hey Ardnold Show xD and I was´nt even live on USA
Third time watching yay
I doubt Biden even likes America he would sell it to Canada or China or any other country !
That last little segment was hilarious
5:20  All Americans: YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Any Portugal wars?
Literally one of your best ones yet
Good job oversimplified you keep us laughing
A new OS video? Christmas has come early!
10:23 Holy shit that is the most accurate portrayal of the House of Commons I've ever seen
Im dead the rant at the end has killed me 🤣😂
I like the fact that i sometimes search you up if you have uploaded something. Do it ervery week til this day.
*5:15* The entire American history in a nutshell.
if john wick and his dog were in this it couldve gone much worse
it’s such a great day when oversimplified uploads
Hey oversimplified you should make a video about Japan next
Wait? What was that last part?
USA USA 🇺🇸
Imagine if USA backed out the deal fully
You took the ending a bit too far
bhruuuuuuuuuuu
I already knew about this event but I was not disappointed in this rendition. When I was taught this in secondary school it was to show how volatile people can be where full on war can come from the most inane of things. This video, like all others, showed the humor and added additional humor to boot.   As always, well done.
the ending is disgusting (ò ó)
Once America had air conditioning, most of the people moved south. Keep it as a different place so we can cross an international border without worrying about language or flying for a summer vacation, but let Hoth be Hoth the other 10 months of the year.
I love how we see oversimplify descend into madness with each video
IM COVERED IN POO AND IM THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE
its amusing how many problems in history has been solved by "And then America pulled guns on 'em"
The right one is the one that gives Britain more control
Our Glorius President DRAKE!!!
It's sure that Obersimplified doesn't talk about Canada. He talks about wars and revolution. Canada never really goes to war and the "revolution" was just them saying : aight Britain, we still recognize you but we are out.
please make a version of all your videos without fUnNy JoKeS
i am now a scared canadian
T
Literally the only thing i hate about this channel when a new video comes out is the fact that I know it’s gonna be months before another one. It’s bittersweet, but the quality of his videos is amazing and i wish he had people helping him in a way that won’t compromise his singular vision but will speed up the video making process cause there is a lot he can cover about history he is only done relatively close history.
Even though he was fairly old having General Winfield Scott being  mad at you would’ve been horrifying, the dude weighed like 300 pounds and was 6 foot five… be like getting beaten by a gorilla
Do the Pastry War please
Were coming for you Canada usa usa usa
I live the Star Wars inspired thumbnail of Pig Wars. The pig is emperor palpatine. There are literally lightsaber base’s at the bottoms of the American and British flags. Also come on don’t invade Canada. They’re so nice they’ll probs just give us their land at some point. On the other hand if they do then it will probably mean that we’re currently at war with china. (If anyone gets the reference I love you.)
Is the pig Morgan Freeman
Oh good lawd, that troll ending!!! I couldn't stop laughing
AHAHAH YOURE ALIVE
Oversimplified you should do a French and Indian War Video
The war of 1812 was not a draw the Americans attempted to invade Canada, that was their objective and not only did they fail to do that, the British burned down the Whitehouse. The Americans FAILED to invade Canada and failure = loss.
We Canadians have never lost a war
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. Also Jesus is king God is king
the potato has sonic shoesssss
I am also in love with PotatoMcWhiskey
Damn, now we gotta wait 6 months for the next video :(
Straight line?
at 36:19 the top island is still green its small and hard to see but if you pay attention you see it.
make a vid abt 6 day war
no there will be o in invading of Canada
AmErIcA wIlL TaKe CaNaDa
Damn bro I thought u died.
Queue the white people who lived west of the colonies
and that's why we have all of you live on the other side of the plant
33:29
Compared to the otter video's, this is quite the dissapointment. Im sorry to say.
Only the Americans and British could almost start a war over such a petty thing.
19:38 I dont think anyone in their right mind would pay nearly three grand over a pig, even a rare one.
Americans wish they could get a slice of our socialised healthcare 😂
“I’m sure this won’t cause anyone…TO DIE!” I love this lmao
This episode of oversimplified was wild
😂😂😂
1:05 I miss when the map was so much spanish :(
How Youtube needed 3 days to recomend this?
You need to start hiring people to edit your videos for you, you can upload way sooner
America invades Canada... meanwhile Mexico advances too 😅🤣
Me for the first ~37 minutes: *attentive listening* Oh wow, what a hell of a escalation. Me for the last ~minute forty-five: AMERICA!!!
I can't stop laughing at 7:57 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was that Morgan Freeman's voice or the pig?!
2 mentions of Canada
come at me america im canadian. no really come at me, im tired of liberal governments infringing meh gun rights and freedom of expression
Yo bro you don't talk about Canada enough, can you do a video on that.
*Grabs sharpened hockey stick*
How do you get court-martialed four times over your imperialistic BS, and not only are you still in the military but have the rank of general.  Oh he was friends of Andrew Jackson...... well that explains everything.
Wow, that's some pig.
you never mention africa
Holy crap, this guy made taking over Canada sound great 🤣
British and their border plans never trust them.
37:19 The true American Dream
And a video about the Great Depression
You should do a video about 1812
Why do you take soo much time brother
Do the iracian war
It looks so cute and good
The one with the British parliament is so accurate, I am not even British but have seen enough of it to know that is exactly how they conduct politics in that ape of a chamber.
Lyman asking Griffin his pig not try to feast on Lymam's poorly fenced potato field was like a Karen asking the impossible and unreasonable to a manager
i feel threatened
Do a video on the western Sahara conflict
Hey oversimplified I love your videos man. Do you think you'll ever do a history video about Billy the kid?
So when is the Canadian US war going to happen? Joe can’t even remember what he had for breakfast 😂🤣😂
Hey Oversimplified can you do a video about poland?
where have u been for 6 months
the British: Burn the white house. Americans: let's call it a draw
Knowing Biden, he might do it.
The return of the king.
You should do a video about the West Virginia Coal Wars of 1921. The labor tensions became so high that workers ambushed company coal convoys in hit-and-run battles, and during the Battle of Blair mountain fighting between the police and the labor unions became so intense that the US army had to intervene. The coal mine companies even had private airplanes drop makeshift bombs on the fighting workers! It became national news and eventually paved the way for future labor reforms and workers rights legislation.
Make a video on Afghan ( Taliban) USA war
What the pig did not tell Limen is that: "but if you kill me I shall cause you too be a victim in a massive political crisis."
Hail for he has returned
NOT OVERSIMPLIFIED RETURNING
If America ruled Canada (my country) we would be horribly overpopulated and the 401 would be a bullet bloodbath.  Honestly I don't think Oversimplified was joking
End was 🤣🤣
0:24 - phe phe ph, look at flags, russians will understand XD
As a Canadian the last couple of minutes were sheer pain to watch.
Buy north vpn and spend money on shit that's already free.  Want to give strangers you're passwords? Pay north vpn  to have them instead.
The quality of animation keeps improving,  no wonder why this video took 6 months
😂
wow I am in Canada and I am offended about what you just said at the end of the video
Harney must've been a democrat
"I hear voices all the time"
Next: American Canadian war coming soon...
finally posted something
BEST VIDEO FR🤣🤣🤣💯
i've watched the hitler videos... why are those banned in other territories??
You haven’t uploaded in ages
Dang. Every time I think the USA is the greatest nation yet devised I get slapped by history. Yes, the greatest nation so far, but still built by extermination of native peoples and helped economically by a couple hundred years of “free” (slave) labor.  Dang it.
Can you please do African history, since most westerners think africa was only villages and cavemen before europeans showed up
Technoblade never dies
All in favor of forcibly annexing Canada?
Tooo many 'jokes'
hey what about MEXICO
37:16  :( I’m Canadian and this hurts.
what about the middle east?
American Mounties would give me nightmares
>be me >elected prime minister in 2032 >scrolling through YouTube  >see this video >they SHOT THE PIG?  Insert Whisky Hotel but its 1812 2 electricboogaloo
Oh monts i guess
1:36😂
GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD
The best twist ending I've ever seen
Oversimplified why u not post vid for yrs
True we should invade canada
Buchanan sounds like Biden
Te fuiste a la berga con el final, buenísimo
Why is no one talking about that all star reference at 7:57
I threw up at the american mounties lol xD
God, please revive salmonela too
Yes
6 months, really man!
How was the war of 1812 a draw I'd the Whitehouse was burnt down
5:50 can we just appreciate how Oversimplified does the sponsors?
I would have been happy with splitting the islands but I forgot we are very unreasonable
See u all in 6 months
A bucket a pig and a potato enters a UN meeting...
Yes yes invade  canada
"canadians, with their cheap insuline" HAHAH good one
For 1 second, I was CERTAIN that you got Morgan Freeman to do the pig's voice xD  P.S. After that ending, even I want to go to war with Canada, and I'm from Africa lol.
1:26 he just got burned bro
Can you make a video about Alexander the Great
21:02 thats fine we have a idiot in office now anyway
You are still the best channel on YouTube 😂🌍
The last 1 minute of this video really takes a pretty dramatic turn...
25:38
This might be the best video I've ever seen
Please make Vietnam war
oh god no
Could you make the video of the unification of Italy later?
Can u PLS do serbian uprising 1 and 2
Lmao the search history at 6:31, “what did henry viii mean by duckies”
MCDONALDS
why did pickett have a anime face here 26:04 it looks so smooth that its like a anime face
Watching the live chat as Oversimplified talks about invading Canada is one of the best things you'll ever see.
This reminds me a lot of the Mexican War of the Pastries, maybe you should make a video on it!
I have a strong feeling Biden is the reincarnation of William S. Harney.
That outro, sheesh
Seriously, WHY THE FUCK, is YT copy-righting PUBLIC DOMAIN and ROYALTY FREE MUSIC?!?
Dude your storytelling abilities are to be used as examples. The way you explain history is so wonderful and educative. Just wanted to say keep up the outstanding work!
38:12 "Biden's coming" made me laugh my ass of for some reason
Biden couldn't find his way to the bathroom without help much less invade Canada hahahaha
What song is playing at 07:25?
So this was an actual cold war before the actual cold War in the nuclear age? So basically Cold War I?
pls, make a video about the paraguai war  LIKE I YOU ALSO WANT THE VIDEO
The McDonald's killed me
İts a total bruh moment when they literally destroyed billions of wild cows just so native americans can starve and go away from their land :/
Man I wish I could see how many Canadians disliked this video
Only Oversimplified can make something I don't give a darn about and never heard of EXTREMELY entertaining, interesting, and informative!    Good Stuff!!!
Anyone else looking to scratch a manifest destiny itch?
These videos always brings a smile to my face, never stop doing them!
Canada's been real quiet since this video.
YYEEEEEEEE HAAAWWWWW!!!!!!
Next video: How OverSimplified started a war with Canada
Ah yes, manifest DENSITY.
Why does Florida looks like a pen¡s when he makes Amerika like a stickman
I’ve watched every single oversimplified video at least twice (except this one). The quality has always been never matched, but over the years I’ve grown to the amount of personality that are in these videos. You literally make history enjoyable to watch for anyone, it’s beautiful
I eat eyes
What happend?its been 6 months.
US: Yeh you know... we should invade Canada! Cant be that hard! its essentially just a giant Minnesota anyway  (Winter rolls through) US: Umm, you guys can have that back now.
I love that damn ending
I bought a plushie
Best ending ever
It’s still beyond me why Mexico and Great Britain didn’t cooperate and go to war with the United States when they were distracted with the civil war. They could have rescued those islands and Mexico could have regained California to Texas.
31:30 Rittenhouse's story
Bro I wish you made more videos more often cause you are just funny man
7:57   “So the Americans kept on coming and they don’t stop coming they got in their wagons and hit the ground running. Didn’t make sense to share Oregon”  God I love this channel 😂
Finally
omg that end was EPIC LOL
19:01
7:57 All Stars moment
obligatory YEEEEEHHH!!!!!! -eH?!
When the world needed him the most he came back
I think Sharon's cat is responsible too, I mean it contacted God 😂
Canada has no right to exist
7:58 Now that's an All Star reference
The whole point about it being "a fair compromise" to put the border at the Columbia river is complete nonsense. The British could barely even populate the region they ultimately got with loyal British subjects. What hope would they ever have of fully utilizing an enlarged version of that?
he doesnt talk about india enough
38:18 shut up man
O shit her we go again
He has
What a journey. I'm Canadian and I knew about this war but not the connection to the civil war
Relax Canadians,  Biden will surely forget wtf he is doing 5 minutes after he decides to invade.
That ending was hilarious, I busted a gut when he mentioned Canadian commenters 😁
Just say it’s pronounced Bark-Shu not Berk-shire as someone from Berkshire
The Morgan Freeman voice on the pig makes this video the best in YouTube
I love this guy to much expecially when he rants about canada
Can someone please tell me what piece of music plays whenever the Americans settle somewhere?
The most American part of all this is the part where Americans flocked to rubber neck the minute a fight broke out.
Dude killed the pig😭😭
You really don't hear much good about USeh eh?
Orderrrrrr
10:23 you actually captured how the House of Commons usually is so well, I forgot it was a skit and not tv
If he was american why did he pull out an ak-47 at 16:01
Mapmakers truly are the greatest war mongers
lol drake is a Canadian
the end of this video feels like a national war threat to me 🥴
Mr president just tell me when we invade Canada and im there
Did you really just push the Oregon Occupation into the lyrics of All Star?
Sooo. Does Nord VPN let me watch Star Trek Discovery *AND* live in England?........ Dude. Cool.
Your videos are the complete package.  Informative, well-produced, directed, animated...your whole team (is it a team?) produces high quality content.  But the script...holy crap, some of the best comedy writing and delivery...I literally LOL when I watch these.  I can't say enough good things about this channel.  Fantastic.
The ending part with our dear friend Biden is...  Well I won't say it's inaccurate...because I wouldn't be surprised if it happens knowing this year.
Always happy when a video comes out from oversimplified!
Cueing that Nordvpn advertisement perfectly was quite funny. Pissing off that Yank.
General Scott: Harney, do not send Pickett back to the island  Harney: *sends Pickett to the island anyways*  This enraged General Scott, who punished him severely
i don't know what was funnier, your joking around about invading canada in typical US Fashion...or the idea of Biden having an original thought XD
Buchanan hide behind the curtain is adorable
you should do a video about the roman empire
Very surprised more "conservatives" in here aren't calling this video "woke", lol.
Me watching a new oversimplified video: “Man the last one was good, but this one might be their best one yet.” Repeat.
Damn, the british should’ve shot up the place in the beginning.
Today, the San Juan islands have a population of around 15,000. There are a tourist destination that offers sea kayaking and orca whale-watching. This might be the best oversimplified yet. Made me laugh several times. Well done!
I always thought the quality of content would decrease over time. But this is the best video yet.
The damn ending make me gasp for air lmao
so is this officially the first shots fired in the Youtube War between the USA and Canada?
All over a stupid pig
Harney, a guy who didn't like to receive orders was a military. The contradictions man.
This is the second time i’ve watched this since it came out. It is without a doubt my favorite video of yours so far. It is such a unique and quality production. I swear it has the most laughs of any video you produced so far.
Return of the king
33:26 FBI OPEN UP 37:18 now im scared
I need a gif of this. Please. 8:48
biden mikght actually do it, he done plenty of stupid shit already
Our boi is back
I think his lost it
That segway :|
Best Oversimplified video ever
At last hers
I always laugh at videos like these, they're amazing and very informative. Glad we're bros now though and will likely be for the rest of the time our countries are independent countries. 🇬🇧🇺🇸
That was the best manifesto I’ve ever heard
I thought this a video about technoblade but nope
I actually live on that center island.
Biden doesn’t even know where he is
and that’s how boys america and canada fought each other because of a youtube video
It's stories like this that make me constantly question what exactly "The American Way" is. War and invasion over a pig? Yeah, sure.
Awesome video!
Humankind is really amazing, like we go to war for others... and we die for it.
Why does oversimplified want to invade Canada? Somebody please stop this man American capitalism does not need to spread
It must've been really stressful to be Charles Griffin on San Juan.
Anybody else notice the all star refrence??
Six days war.
Omg anti American anti white anti Christian jokes!!!! So original I laughed so hard
3:39-3:41 sounds so much like Hitler's belief of lebraunseum (living space) for the Germans to expand their population which led to invasion of Europe in the first place
7:55
Perfect placement of Florida ad America's junk lol
Brits shoulda got it
38:13 haha lol the last day of yours u will hear FBI OPEN UP oversimply dies 😂😂😂😝
7:57 All stars lol
Cant you get a team so we get more content
Did cargo pass through Panama by land mid 19th century? If not then it is implied that the Panama Canal existed then.
drake is Canadian  hahahaha
the ending god damn killed me xD
0:50  when your teacher turns on *OVERSIMPLIFIED*
This reaching #7 on trending is testament to our progress towards Idiocracy (2006 movie).
The ending was so American 😆
Me=*waits for upload* Oversimplified= YES.  I am now watch
Omg the ending!🤣
I think u need to make a video of India because india has great war history
You gotta be kidding me.. A war broke out cause of a small island and a pig
I hear voices all the time 😂😂😂😂
7:57 to 8:06 did anyone realise he was singing the all stars lyrics?
27:26 I literally had to zoom in 200% to actually see the map change
38:17       jeez
I expect it’s a VIETNAM WAR THAT YOU’RE PREPARING THE WHOLE TIME.
OMG YOU’RE BACK!!!!
these videos get more chaotic every single time
Makin bacon
canada doesnt have nukes cause us THE UK have them....canada is our colony so dont try it youll lose
The balkan wars?
Biden has a baby face. is he 35? is he 65 idk. little do i care. also... too bored to google it  edit: take notes all you 65 lifting addicted elderly ladies
Now let wait another 6 months and a 5 weeks or 4 7 idk
The real British response would be a cannon and cup of tea to the face
Thanks for the early present for my birthday and Christmas Oversimplified!
WHen I saw you posted I was so excited
33:06 He's going to put Picket back on the Island isent He? 😑 Edit: And I was corect.
8:04 SomeBODY once told me
I love the ending it hilarious
I NEVER see the sponsor coming NEVERv
During the last patriotic talk it should have been like the Robespierre situation "who is in favour of putting Robespierre to the guillotine? All in favour?" "Oh noooo" with Germany, Britain, France etc. "who is in favour of invading the US? All in favour?" "Oh noooo"
Wait what just happened in the last few seconds xD
It has been half a year tf dude
glorious ending.
7:57 damn
And it wasn't even a really cool pig with freakin' metal wings and 8 legs and shoots flippin' laser beams and can grow more pigs out of it for extra pigs!
Is that morgan freemans voice? xD
I dont like the humor in this one. It's too goofy and too reliant on the characters going "ggaaAAAAAAHHH" and "nnnOOOOOOOOOO" and the blurring or vibration or whatever around the scene during the screams.
I was laughing wayyy too much at the end honnestly
genuinely thought the pig was voiced by Morgan Freeman
31:02  How did Morgan Freeman make it into an oversimplified video
I guess you could say they were “eager beavers”
mans really just threatened a whole country
07:59 he just started singing all star
Lyman was actually mad because porky was eating out spuddy better than he was.
Had my honeymoon on the San Juan Islands. Beautiful place.
3:38😂
Funniest video of yours yet! Dude… Un-UNCOOL!
Akhirnya upload baru ♪☆＼(^０^＼) ♪(／^-^)／☆
How do you 'invade' a non country occupied by stone age people? Especially if you buy it from them? That's not an invasion, that's a purchase. This commie slant on everything is so tiresome.
I almost hope something near a war happens to the US right now so in the future we get to see oversimplified explain the incompetencies of both Trump and Biden
A draw? Idk what video games you play but if I take your capital and burn it to the ground I win!
Great segue to the sponsor message.
7:58 All star referance :)
As a Bulgarian I kinda want you to cover the first and second Balkan War. The first one starts out promising for the Balkan League with them embarrassing the Ottomans on multiple fronts. Then the once allies almost immediately engaged in the age-old European tradition of terrible teamwork and started breaking promises and treaties, declaring wars on each other and committing atrocities on the civilian population.  I'm already familiar with the conflict but I'd like to see a more humorous take on it, even if my country is probably gonna be the butt of most jokes involved considering how this goes for it.  Fun fact: in school when we covered the Balkan wars, my history teacher referred to the second one as "Междусъюзническата война" which is Bulgarian for "the War of Allies".
What is worse  A murder of a pig almost got the USA into a war  The USA threatens to invade a country because there are a few striking workers
I hate this vid because of the end britan is the best and rules the see
MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE!
why tf did germany deside?
Is Oversimplified going down-hill?
32:10 conclusion of all happened HAHAHAHA
best ending ever
Yes the U.S ARMY is coming for Canada
Nice joke at the start except white people fought over territory all the time. Also funny how the next thing you talk about is white people fighting over territory.  You are a funny guy, I just found this ironic. Thanks for the video.
would have changed a lot then...
Only this guy could make a watch a 38 min video completely on normal speed lol
My mind would blow (again) if dis dude do a collab video with Bill Wurtz
Perfect!! Lots of laughts !! Hahahaha
Bro did really make a 40minute quality video
do one on the irish war  for saint paddys day
Yeeeeeees he’s back
That ending was quite unexpected
I heard theres a lot of canadians that want the US to take canada into the US. Also brandon isnt doing anything in this country.
Yes finally a new one!
Props for using the HBC colour scheme on the characters!
The invasion of canada. Oversimplified has finally lost it, I’m kinda concern
Wish there was more native land to conquer, ahhh the good ole days
am i in canada - best moment of youtube
I Wonder How will Oversimplified Recover After that Outro
I missed you so much dude I used to watch you all the time I enjoy watching your vids. (Not in a creepy way also.)
Saying America had “a bunch of people already living there.” Ignores the facts regarding population density in the wilderness of the United States. The frontier was almost completely devoid of human life fir as far as you could go. Hence why people saw it as a good place to settle down.
The ending was so motivational
Invading Canada sounded plausible and epic, until you mentioned Biden being at the wheel.
Been a while man. When ya covering Vietnam?
Oversimplified=upload videos every 6 months?
This video has 5 million wiews and it has only been a week holy moly that is a lot of vievs.
Holy
over simplified, you diddidly  darn done it again!
Can you do the Bahamas.
thank you , please keep making more
Winfield beating Harney while screaming is the funniest thing i've ever seen XD
*dont shoot pigs, kids. you might start a war.*
I loved the ending skit its way too hilarious 😂
These videos are so well made
Please make a video a about the greek revoloution
Oversimplified, are you ever going to do a face reveal? Come on man! Tell us about yourself, we wanna know!
Do the Indian 🇮🇳 revolution
has anyone else realized how the brits are bald and the americans arent?
TPOT 1 Rewinds Me
is it just me or oversimplified is always ajout bald men and guys with hair arguing with each other?
When will we get a Watermelon Wars episode?
Oh that final part… :) If Putin was the president of United States. :)
I unsubed because of the last part, not cool dude.
Cringe, I feel like the person who wrote the scenario for the ending was either drunk or high
War of 1812??? Or are you Americans too afraid of talking about how we burnt down the white house
that segue! chef kiss!
Ok that ending was a perfect way to showcase what people’s minds were thinking like under the manifest destiny, the sheer manic glee at expanding the continent and becoming better than before overshadowing all moral and reason and even making the mind invent some god given excuse for their goals. If that really was intentional, then kudos to you, because it was excellent.
Explain nanking massacre
The Last Minute is scary
i am in kazakhstan?!?!?!?
He really worked over time with this one. We are so blessed
Welcome back OverSimplified! I love your videos! 😘😎
Let's be honest, the area would still be better off in Canada.
7:57 all star reference lol
Nice video! It was really funny, haha.
"I didn't say they were white people"
Cant wait for OverSimplified - WW3.
05:02 whats the name of that song?
Holy shit that All Star reference lmao
This is the first time another human voice has appeared on his channel
That ending tho 😂
The best one in this video in my opinion is        James Buchanan
I love these vids 😂😂😂
VIETNAM WAR
10:25 I now know what the hammer was for
Next video the unification of germany plz
The legend is back!
Oversimplified, it's time to do a video on something from the Eastern side of the world now!
Can you make video about Bangladesh liberation war
Lol everytime they had to come up with a border, they always suggested straight line.
i fall in love in this mini song in 7:56
Best ending by far
We all have being waiting for 6 months freaking god
Time to get my popcorn
Finally!
7:13 SPOTTED WHAT?
Let's agree on the fact that the ending of this video is one of THE greatest things that has ever happened to youtube.
If we were taught history by this means  We'd al get 200 out of 100 marks  Because of writing answers in a waaay oversimplified manner...
Well, call us when you need someone to arbitrate that new problem of yours. Sincerely, Germany.
He should make a video about the chinese civil War (1927-1949)
Well umm for a war. I would just say good luck America. You will be fighting against Canada which everyone loves while every fucking human hates you lol.
“BRITISH territory!” “H- F- J-“ “BAAAAAAAA!!!” “BAAAAAAAA!!!” Was very epic
America is always not agreeing to fair deals in this video for some reason
best thumbnail so far
I know it's a cartoon but I didn't wanna see that pig get shot. Good looks with the zoom out. USA!!!
finally
Guys shut up, oversimplified posted
hey 1 of these days can you do one of the 1916 easter rising.
They went to the empire of Germany for arbitration in 1872?! That nation was literally born yesterday at that point, did they seriously not find anyone else?
I  just cant stop waching this video its so good
This is funny
21:29 😂😂
Idk why but i love sheriff barnes
Alright, he finally went insane.
"This is the first time a country have ever gotten so close to gone to war with a superpower for a dumb reason"  -Winfield Scott   Prussian king (Frederick William III) who declares war on France because his wife told him to: *Am I a joke to you?*
Really, you wanna invade Canada that I love Canada because of his anthem.
The really important question is: What if Lyman had accepted the three wishes?
HAHAHAHAH THE ENDING. Made me me laugh hard as a canuck.
16:03 that's russian
U-S-eh
Best part hahahaha:  33:29
3:42 why do you hate your own kind so much?
14:04 🤣🤣🤣
That ending just gave me the biggest freedom boner I’ve ever gotten 🇺🇸🇺🇸
33:20 general had enough
British: Making a fair compromise that protects the interest of both parties Americans: *Shooting everywhere*Gun speak louder than words
ohh yes Indian just name anything and evrything u come across a Indian lol
The Morgan-Freeman-like voice (for the innocent-version pig) made me laugh hard. That was a great touch!
С любовью из России. Мы тебя здесь любим!
Absolutely loved this video even as a indian who has no connection with North America but still as history lover I loved it ❤️. Good jobs guys top quality stuff 👌
10:56 😂😂😂
Thanks to that ending, Im having nightmares tonight
Do a video about jamaica or the carribean
STraight Line?
Commenting for the algorithm
could you make a 1672 franco dutch war video?
Any Indian here bro?
Im so happy that oversimplified is back!
8:50 so u mean every American was texan?
OverSimplified, from man to man, if you ever deside to make the Yugoslaw wars or something about Yugoslavia, turn off the comments. I know this people, I am from balkan. With comments it's like suicide.
8:28 😂
Yes new vid
Canadians.
4:03 in a nutshell
so which countries was the hitler video banned in?
That was the best ending to a video I’ve ever seen
OverSimplified has gotten a little carried away with the sarcasm and dirty 5th grade humor. I do appreciate their work, but it's too much now. You used to actually narrate history in a simple way instead of spending half of the time joking around. It takes attention away from the point. Let alone the topic. Why choosing the Pig War? Why not some other major and important war or revolution?
Whoa man calm down with the scream
4:15 sneak peak of gta 7
I love dad jokes and I don’t know why but “U-S-eh” made me crack up.
Still waiting for Vietnam and the war of 1812 solo videos I’ll wait 30 more years for you
Before I even watch the video... WTF? Why didn't I get a notification? THIS IS GOLD!!!!
So... is he a war mongeror?
Kinda reminds me of technoblade’s potato war
the ending was great!
That’s an ending that I like
16:35 got me on my knees
That's it, I'm getting a patreon. I can't enjoy this content for free any longer in good conscience.
Oversimplified after the end of the video: i almost lost my shit back there
Who is it who spoke to God ?😂
Pls i have a request can u Make the Yugoslaw wars 1991-1999 i will be the happiest man
Whenever oversimplified drops you know that week is going to be great !
18:46 Top ten saddest anime deaths. Seriously though, I feel kind of bad for the pig man. I forgot his name.
Your back I miss watching you!!!!
That last part was funny
5 million in 3 days goddamn. People love oversimplified and so do I
The cow war now the pig war 2022 = THE SHEEP WAR BABEEEE
I love how noone reacts about him screaming about Canada at the end of the video.
This video just made my week. Thank you.
Let me ask just the most obvious question no one has asked yet, Who’s Frank?
This is the best one yet and it’s no contest
I absolutely love all of work you put into these videos. but if I may ask what map you are using I wish use it in my Geo/history project
7:57 confirmed,oversimplified is a rapper now
i jusg watched a video from 3 years ago and boy oh boy did you voice change
A mistake of Indian
Bitch you could make so much money by selling accessories so people can make customised oversimplified dolls
So, essentially in 1939, somebody was just trying american "we need more living space" strategy ... but forgot that they were surrounded by whites :)
4:10 nahh thats hot garbage right there😂😂😂😂😂😂💀look at the freaking smiles on their faces
USA! USA! USA!
That was.... Amazing :-D So the USA still owe around $3,170 today for the pig?
Just crouch and un crouch
0:50 ... seriously give us some warning before dropping that bomb :)
Yeah Canada give us American every territory 60° North because you guys don't have any good places up there.
Finaly new video
VENGEANCE
charles griffin remind me abou peter griffin
Simply great
That escalated suddenly
That intro is the most racist intro i've seen in years ! Love history
THE KING IS BACK
"When all was said and done it was basically a draw" oh dont tell Canadian and American Textbooks, they do not agree with you....or eachother lol
Thanks for this video! Amazing work
:-)
16:29  “Oh no…” — Douglas
Dem hawian shepherds thoe
I hear Kerbal Space Programm Music
Dang. The Philippines sure got a taste of that nice juicy Manifest Destiny. (^.^)
I would have paid more than what I paid for Endgame to watch it on the big screen
Oops, back to war.  The US in a nutshell
LoL, opened google maps and spoilered myself.
Can you do the history of Albania next pls
This video was already great but that ending Canada rant was beautiful.
Hey Oversimplified, it would be cool to make a Vietnam War video.
never had so much fun learning history xD
Best video ever
oh hes an american
A war that have potato and pig in it?       *Why it sounds so familiar?*
End of this video so funny world should know about it
13:27 made me laugh so hard!😂😂
I'm actually moving to Canada
Please make Vietnam and Korean War videos please.
America invading Canada... Montreal airlift, sequel to Kabul...
He's back bitches
7:56 why is some guy who explains history singing Shrek song
Have not even watched it yet, but I already know its gonna be unbelievably good. Have a like, good sir!
Why is the pig so cute wtf
The "being American" gag was great every time, but I couldn't help but giggle that the Yanks were willing to go to war over unpaid tax on sheep in disputed territory, but ALSO happy to literally invade another country for a gold rush... which I'm ABSOLUTELY sure they did in a perfectly legal manner ensuring all taxes paid and immigration laws followed :P The added level of demanding British citizens pay taxes was not lost on me. I'm sure the Yanks wanted to ensure these tax payers were duly represented though... :D
If you were my teacher I wouldnt sleep during my History classes
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The only casualty of this war was just a pig.  What about the potato 🥔 ?
Oversimplified does know that if Canada disappears, the world will fall to crumbles, right?
Equators Gonna Equate
Best end yet
yahoo, new vid
I wonder mention the french  vs the brits during this time and America was sendobg supplies to the french till british took over there ship and ppl on board there.. ok i notice besdes thst was heavily skip that startef and was act of war in 1812,  besides that spanish on the other siden and it was called the manifest of destiny is what they called it to expand  straight a head
Me when a dead pig almost causes a war between 2 powerful countries at the time: Yes, this war is very worth it because of a dead pig.
Should Do The Scottish War Of Independance or the Cod War
McDonald’s restaurants need to be that portable. 😁
Do narco wars next
Everyone: Canada never gets recognized New Zealand: you dare challenge me
You know if this actually became a war what would American schools say with how it started
Wait wait wait... I didn't say they were white people!  I died laughing
"Affordable insulin" That makes Canada sound awful, having to actually pay for Insulin.
wait if you attack canada you will die of cold and canada will be crazy and angry with uk on his side
dope
sorry but technoblade ??!??
Fun Facts:The Expansion in the west lead to tribe wars *until the 1850s or 1840s and wars like war of dakota* War of 1812 was like also a tribe war cuz the Cherokee tribes were the ally of England while Seminole tribes were the American's ally
Haha, I hate Canada too & we should invade it!! ^_^
The legend is back.
i found the hidden NES controller
Hey is the oversimplified plushie going to be available forever?
Aww.. A perfect example of us Americans.
The way this guy sneaks in his godamn advertisements is hilarious
Man, USA is such an asshole bully!
Biden for Canadian annexation 2024 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Ok I'm British. And watching these videos makes me hate america more and more. Not the people just the country, well some of the people 😅
Anyone has a record of the arguments why kaiser wilhelm I favor the haro strait border?
When tf is the Vietnam war video coming??
this is what crt is.
So the history books have it wrong,what's this world coming to when it should Be called history scheme mode when at south park! Lol but what do i know. Hahaha
Technoblade war
rather interesting outro eh?
Little over the top :/
The American stereotype is the best. And I get to say that because I'm American..... And I have a BaZOOkaaaa
"Not the curtain, again."
this actually was pretty heartwarming
18:12 here's one of my favourite part
If America invaded Canada then any form of good health care will cease to exist along with safe gun laws, natural parks, common sense and the continents dignity.
straight line? straight line.
Finnaly a upload
Oh damn im oughtta watch my back. (gets a bulet in the backhead)
What the fu....
cool vid you made hope you make more contents like these
Is it just me or did his voice drop?
HEY- This isn't Technoblade.
That wasn't fair to us Canadians eh
Its so much better than school's history class
Finally after a long wait
Make a Warcraft oversimplified pweeease 🥺🥺
Lmao that’s home! No I’m not even joking, I live on San Juan Island. Every time I meet someone from another state I have to tell them about this wonderful conflict. I’ve actually been to the American and British camps on the island. Like it said in the video, Pickett’s camps were pretty exposed. That part is completely true. You can walk right down to the water from the camp!
Dislike
35:48 In those years the Papal state was not a thing anymore.
Awesome vid as always my dude. Keep up the good work
This episode is charged with imparcial thought... But hey, you do you. I guess it os ok as long as no one thinks that they are learning history and know it is only satire and commedy.
I  A M  F I L I P I N O
woah i thought this was some technoblade lore
that last part was the best
Julius Ceaser Over simplified next
Wow man this guy has really become anti-American over the years
I don't know as a proud Canadian Patriot This video kind of makes me mad
5:38 - the wind is blowing on both side what the lol 😂
Kerbal music always gets my vote.
Wouldnt it be funny is USA really did consider invading Canada just because of the ending skit of this video.
I wanted to let everyone that Jesus Christ loves you and wants the best for you and is coming very very soon. Heaven and hell are real and It’s the end times and I pray and hope everyone will repent and come to Jesus Christ before it’s too late. I know this is going to offend people but I have to speak for the Lord and speak the truth, the rainbow is not an symbol of pride it is a symboly from God reminding us that he will not flood the whole world again. I love you all and I’m praying for everyone’s health,for everyone to have peace and for everyone to have salvation. I love you all Romans 10:9-13, 1 John 1:9,John 14:6, Proverbs 16:18 and Leviticus 18:22🙏🕊🌈✝️💜💜
13:28 lmao
Yooo he posted
32:31
Oversimplified: Talks about invading america at the end of his video. Me, an intellectual: Kiska time.
37:38 touche-pas à montreal, hein?
He's here The man is here
Absolutely excellent video as always... Although ya kinda went a little overboard with that crazy ass ending. 🤣 But still a great video.   You know... Maybe that ending isn't so crazy, it would be nice to drive to Alaska without having to go through the border crossing... Hmmm.😉😜
33:29 for karma.
This is some mr bean type comedic situation lmao 🤣
Beautiful see you in 6 months
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO WARNING TOO AWESOME TO BE ALIVE
Wtf just hapenned at the end...?
What *did* Henry mean by duckies though?
Please make a video on India. I love your vids though.
The US will never invade Canada. No one will ever invade Canada. Canada is too cold.
Buchanan was single handedly the worst president in American history doing nothing to stop the country from going into Civil War.
Did someone say new Oversimplified video?
1812 was a draw huh? A bit like Vietnam? Or Afghanistan? Seems America either wins or its a draw
The heck is that ending lol
The San Juan Islands are so beautiful! I live in Southern WA and went to a summer camp there for years on Orcas Island and it's unreal! So many good memories there
Let's manifest destiny! *plants millions of mceedees*
30:00
He's back!!
By far the funniest video ive seen from OverSimplified ORDER ORRRDERRRR SHUT UP Throws a staff at person the person goes through wall, i live next to fort vancouver
Next up on korean war 1950s  Nk: straight line? Sk:straight line.
xD <3
Don't worry, all of North & South America will be ruled by US under President Gilbert Gottfried and his beautiful voice
Oversimplifieds voice acting is really damn good
33:28
And now the Hawaiian Pizza will now be truly hawaii
29:49
American beeing an american
the reference to the Smash Mouth's song is gold
Yo hold up… are you trying to start a war😂
War mongering is against community guidelines XD (I’m kidding pls don’t block me)
your videos are getting better and better
"Sleep with one eye open, because Biden's coming, baby" As a Maple boy, this is the most terrifying threat I've heard.  American Mounties do sound very intimidating. The rootin' tootin' power of the cowboy(plus the powerful yeehaw buffing nearby allies), and the horsepower of the mounties. Devastating combo for the most effective DPS and hit-and-run tactics possible.
38:12 Biden is what?
Who is ready to wait 6 months for the next 2 part video
Not white people! 🎉🎊🤣
Man its so fun learning about history when you dont have to force it into your head by school
36:26 sound reason to go to war right there
Craig, where the hell you been
That took... that took one hell of a turn at the end there.
Is the thumbnail a star wars reference?
No one thought that Canada invades America first comrade
did they at least eat the damn pig?
29:19
29:20
28:20
🇺🇸🔫👎👎👎👎👎😠😠😠😠😠
20:23
lol a loss described as a draw lmao only the  Americans lol
Oversimplified about to start another war 🤦😂😂😂😂
Perfectly cut Scream moments that probably going to be a meme:  -7:27 -13:59 -16:27 -17:24  -19:22 -29:12
BEST Ending EVER ! ! !
who else thought this was about Technoblade
Both the US and Canada committed Native American genocide
The conquest of Canada 2022?
*Ferb I know what we are doing today*
missed you
Make a video on India too... Just wanted to see you explain it🤣😂
19th century: So you want to start the war over a damn pig?! 21th century: So you want to start the war over a damn video?!
+
imperialism: if your enemies can't win a war against an overpowered foe, they don't deserve to exist *glances at France*
This never gets old 🤣
I love how smooth the animations have become and the humour is as oversimplified as always. Truly quality over quantity.
37:18 I’D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY YANKS
16:28 the sound for the American boat is perfect
Dislike, very left wing.
"Being Americans, they pulled out a bunch of guns"
Flag at 5:41 upside down
I live in Washington, and have visited San Juan island a lot and have never known this. Anyways, great video and I loved the rampage at the end.
Oversimplified you see. How about that Vietnam war ongoing?
Wow star wars style thumb nail 😂🤣
EVERYONE LOOKUP "Gematria Effect News 24"
Last comments... Biden couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag... Canada would win
Should have contained the sheep when they had the chance....now the entire country is infested with them.
If this causes a war you should make a video about it
For being so fat he had to be loaded on his ship, Scott moved like a champ to beat up that psychopath. Mad props!
How did General Pickett able to hear with the iron?😆😂
If my teachers made history THIS fun to absorb, I'm rather certain I would have remembered a lot of this. But alas it was in through one ear and out the other so as to memorize details enough for an A and nothing stuck. This is so much more fun!
Tell us your a leftist, without saying your a leftist.
I miss your vids! I waited for your uploaddddddd
Roman Conquests next plesss
The ending is pretty hilarious 🤣
Canadians in the comments: Why doesn't he mention us? That's part of Canada not Britain! Me Googling "when did Canada gain independence": Most of this happened before 1867, and that wasn't even part of the dominion.
38:12 YOU AINT BLACK!
14:35
Vietnam war next ?
I like that he put Waddles from gravity falls as the pig
38 minute war. Pleaseeeee and thank you. Also, Canada is sleeping with one eye open from now on.
Poor waddles. (Only legends get this)
What 🇵🇭 sir ha u lost vietnam war
Lol wouldn't happen canada has the uk russia would do anything to have a war with the us and german and franch plus India and a bunch of countries trys  are also with the uk so I mean we would win
The Rewatchability of these vids is so good
37:22 you miss 2 facts, the general cold and hockey
OVERSIMPLIFIED IS BACK??!! :D
Van isle gang where you at
Straight line?
If only Canada had kept Oregon.  What a missed opportunity!
The us never won a war since 1945 But Canada never lost a war
Bruh you forgot Canada
one eye open when i sleeping one eyeeeee
We may be hockey loving,maple syurp drinking, peace loving canadians. However when we go to war we are ruthless.
Dat ending tho... It was so funny and humourous lol
When the nord VPN pin coming out
well, that was unexpected. great. funny and super informative. but unexpected.
Lyman, if you let me live, I shall grant you 3 wi-
27:26
Good ending 🇨🇦<🇺🇸
The segment at the end was enough to make me watch this 100 times
My cat of 10 years just passed today, this video is the only thing that cheered me up today. Thank you.
I am surprised that it took so long for somebody to suggest just splitting the islands between them...
Bru amerika want peace but stil want to start a wor realy i dont want so that world wor 3 wil heppen
Idk why but Pickett's face kinda looks like that of napoleon III's face XD
Imagine if the Germans went “I say that, that island IS MINE!” Lol
I died with laughter at 30:56 xD
THE BRITS DIDNT BURN THE WHOTE HOISE CANADA DID
The ending lmao. It was epic
HOG RIDAAAAA
Vastly oversimplified
Benjamin: but look at those curves  Canadian: I'd worry less about Canada's curves and more about your own curves  That part was funny
Wait that Pickett was THAT Pickett? Damn!
You got me through my high-school history class 3 years ago, you made learning fun and enjoyable. I thank you for that, don't stop making these beautiful videos.
38:11 Biden's not the only American cumming with a vengeance
31:30 imagine how much fun the narrator has recording these videos.
I would love to see a video on the Nigerian Civil War, one of the only conflicts during the Cold War in which USA, USSR, and UK were on the same side.
In the animation vancouver island isn't a island
At the end he just lost it
they removed the pole damn i really wanted to see some stripper action
I damn near stood up and broke into singing the star spangled banner at the top of my lungs with that ending
7:58 bars
George Pickett: "Nothing could possibly be worse than this." 4 years later George Pickett: "Um..."
I hope your not a simp overSIMPlified.
Can you go for the punic wars
This might be the best one yet
The jokes and 4th wall in this video were insane
That ending was beautiful
5:57 when an enemy turns into NORDVPN...
This was the pinnacle of Oversimplified
India?
You monster! you killed morgan freeman! haha
This was surprisingly complicated for something supposed to be oversimplified. Begs the question how messed up this thing really was.
That ending was soooo good. It's good because he doesn't do it like that often.
So the people sitting in power in UK and US have always been this stupid.
2318008 on the calculator, lol
As a Washingtonian thanks for sharing this hilarious chapter in our history. I tell this story all the time when we sail through.
Spanish or Philippine American war please!!!!
"IT'S MY DENSITY' -Oversimplified typo
Hey you drew the pig wrong berkshires have erect ears
As a Canadian, let's talk about this! Peace and love man <3
Watched it 5 times and still can't get enough ❤️
4:10 didnt see that coming
"BECAUSE BIDEN'S COMIN BABY!!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's about time someone finally recognized our soon to be 51st state
This Pig Murderer Are More Sad Than an Fallen of Europe
HES FUCKING UPLOADING AGAIN!
you forgot who burned down your white house didn't you?       jokes aside I liked this video, good job as always and thanks from Canada
You lost me at  Biden.

Ah. The world is right again. Oversimplified posted
Is this just me or the pig look like Waddle?
That threat in the end.........
Let's Go Brandon!!!
Let's goooooo
36:58
Please never change your outro music its so iconic to your channel now
That last part about the U.S.A. conquering Canada was literally "OVERSIMPLIFIED."
Therapist: oversimplified’s evil laugh doesn’t exist, it can’t hurt you  Oversimplified’s evil laugh: 31:10
The video war!! Coming soon/ Oversimplified

Wasn't expecting to get my Christmas present this early

The best way to learn history, period. I love all of your videos. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
12:57 & 13:12 = Squid Game vibes.
Right I'm sorry but Canada is not available 4 ur manifest destiny stuff really sorry
i cannot describe my shock when i discovered that this fuck up pickett was the same fuck up as THE pickett , of pickett’s charge fame. crazy man
We might need an oversimplified video for this oversimplified video.
I freaking love the ending and Canada must surrendered to the USA after this😂😂
Oversimplified is back!
Bro that ending though
i’m only 10min in but i just got an ad from The Bay (Hudson’s Bay Company) 🤨
Did anyone else hear “I hear voices all the time”
Pin me if I trick you. ... Read more
Technoblade has 1st he war
It would have been nice two months ago for APUSH.
North America as One Nation would be nice.
plush kinda looks like a snowman
In highschool 1 MONTH A YEAR for 4 STRAIGHT YEARS we talked about this subject in history class. I learned more and remembered more from this 40min long video than the HUNDREDS of hours I spent learning about it in school.
Your voiceover work has really improved. Not to say it was bad before, but you’re presenting with a little more _pizzaz_ .You know, a bit more _zing_ .
7:58 omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude what kind of dr*gs were you on when you recorded 36:55?
After all that the Germans ultimately get to decide a conflict between America and Britain. I did nazi that one coming.
Wow
That All Star reference is INSANE!!! I love you man, keep up the good work!!
S T R A I G H T  L I N E .
Best ending evee
Bravo!!!!
I'm so happy you covered this! Not only is it one of my favorite Hey Arnold episodes but I live in Washington State so it's really fun to see history of an island that I can see from my house
This man uploads to prove he aint dead
Fuck were dead
So glad there's been a new vid. Soooooo goooood. Thank you!
PIGGGGGG
This is like watching a movie but of history i fucking love it
Pig and potatoes, are you sure technoblade didn't  have a hand in this part of history?
Bring it on we may not win but you’ll never recover from the ass whooping we lay on ya. LETS GO CANADA!!!!!!
I'm kind of sold on the war to the north if that means cheaper maple syrup.   Sorry, New North Dakota.
The last outro like canadian invasion is too much
Rep Oregon💛
History is just full of stupidities.
Hey, what about the east cost of Canada!    ... Sorry
of course u r american XD
My teacher played this entire video on class W teacher
The invasion of Canada is inevitable.
When is Vietnam war oversimplified
Can we just make “And being American, they pulled guns on him.” the new *Oversimplified* meme?
Indepedence
7:58 love the song lmao
ermergerd its been like a year man
Yes
Dream smp makes much more sense now.
LIFE IS GOOD, OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED AGAIN
I usually don't post to video's very often but this is about the San Juan Islands that are just north of me. They are amazing and have been to both camps and have seen what they were fighting over. It's nice to see this getting some attention outside of the area!
I back oversimplified in the invasion of Canada!
How did you make it through this video, and not mention the Ridgefield High School "Spudders" who go to school literally 25 minutes away from Fort Vancouver?
Oversimplified with mr beast subs invade Canada mr beast arms the men buys tanks and oversimplified goes by air and places McDonald’s everywhere.
As an Oregonian, can confirm it is merica
Now we need OverSimplified video of Canada.
0:13 Me
Pls talk about Philippine revolution next video pls
Make a video about Québec the beautiful province it as a lot of history whit the french
As a Canadian i laughed at the last part eh
I like how the Brits just wanted a territory for just *beavers*
The ending was so patriotic they even got the USSR shivering.
I’ve been saying it for years! Canada is actually future American land and they just don’t know it yet!!
24:46 douglas was mad, he knew he'd been had
We should also finally invade the indian reservations.
I love seeing how American politics haven’t changed a bit since the founding of the country. Just white men doing whatever the heck they want with no consideration for consequences
Brandon's only coming back down the steps he just tripped up. 🤣
I swear I was just thinking about this last week, then come to find out you guys dropped this 💎 made my whole week! It takes awhile to see a fresh upload but you guys knock it out the park every time! Keep up the solid work
OMG I WAS DYING AT THE END but Canada is better tbh
Next could u do the Mongol Empire or Genghis Khan
7:54 it’s like a real life lorax
Loved the video !! :)
For Ending replay:- 37:08
Do a video about the wild west and Cowboys I think that would be an interesting video.
This man makes history fun
*_Watch your back Canadians._* 😂
in all fairness, the fourth fence would not have stopped a pig, those bastards are naturally good at destroying fences.
Glorious ending ahhaha
How nice to see cousins in dispute...
Crusade when
american mounties are a dream i hold dear to my heart
As a born Washington, I love the San Juan islands. They are one of the most beautiful places on Earth. I can see why the Canadians wanted them
"Bidens coming baby" Ive already have nightmares about him but now there ten times worse
What do you mean just a pig what about spuddy
Me when we get to Fort Vancouver: Ah yes now we're talking about the land I grew up in. This should be fun. Hey what's that mountain back there it looks awfully familiar except... oh. Oh geeze. That's what Mount Saint Helens still looked like when I was 6.  "Oversimplified," yet also "full of unnecessarily subtle, real and well researched details." Take my Internet points. Take all of them!
Florida as a penis is just scrumptious
Love the shout put to gretsky
I love how people jump all over the U.S. for riding the Indians out and taking over what would become the continental Unites States while ignoring how Europe pretty much colonized the rest of the planet.
Canadians: this oversimplified guy is not talking about us enough Oversimplified:So you have chosen death
Great video as always dude!😃
It’s been so long!
Why was i not notified about this video
"It probably won't suprise you to learn Pickett came in dead last in his graduating class." Holy shit, Pickett's charge makes so much damn sense now.
please note the stupidly placed bit of America that you have to go through Canada to access, that is point roberts, in all honestly, as a Washington resident, it should just be ceded to Canada, culturally and economically its basically there already.
'the americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running, didn't make sense (to keep sharing oregon)'  ......oversimplified you absolute MADLAD
This is by far your best work yet.  I can't stop laughing.
Oversimplified's videos will always be the reason i love history, despite the fact that my school had to make the students memorize the dates and all that shit. all i wanted is to learn about the events and not just timestamps to etch in my brain
18:38 I love how he pumped a double barrel shotgun
That sir, that was an epic ending.  Note: do not invade Canada.
Nothing makes me happier when I look at my subscriptions and see the blue dot next to Oversimplified.
Know this tale well.  You did it justice with some wonderful comedic timing.  I can see San Juan Island from where I live….
I live in Canada bitch
YES
as a Canadian, specifically someone in B.C, I find this fascinating. I grew up about 7 hours away from those islands and never heard about them before. My socials teacher used to play your videos in class to help us retain information by making it fun. I love this channel! Keep it up!
Sus
OverSimplified's humorously absurd retelling of situations. Relaxes my bowels. 😌
US-eh 😂
3:32 umm Florida?
You’re back!! :)
the pig sounded like morgan freeman
Balkan wars next?
You can have Biden we don't want him!!!!
the legend is back
8:26 Damn, America is hung!
He shot Waddles!  NOOOO!
33:23 I like how Winfield Scott was hiding behind the door,you can see it it’s a little dark but you can see it. This is why I like oversimplified,he always adds attention to detail on his vids.
It wasn't a draw. The Canadians won the war of 1812.
its pronounced wha-om county not whaat-c-kom county. Kinda confusing but you know how english be sometimes. also its said as San Uan not San Juan.
Holy shit, this whole thing is gold.
As a canadian, the ending part scared me. My goodness a red white blue mounty. And maple syrup ... holy crap thats not right.
Americans wouldn’t even need to invade Canada. If we ask nicely they’d probably just give it to us. If not the worst they can do is ride giant moose and just polity ask us to leave if we tried invading.
School isn't enough, just watch an OverSimplified video and learn History and Geography.
"you're an idiot"    (said so many times i can't put a timestamp)
I think americans were just expansionist  Even if it was Europeans instead of natives they would of fought for it War of 1812 is kinda evidence for that since they went to war with Britain for land So is it really fair to make such a claim when there is evidence that ethnicity didnt matter when it came to expansionism
DRAKE FOR PRES
That Morgan Freeman bit caught me off guard
I’m from Washington State and I still remember learning about this in school. The two camps are still really nicely preserved by the park service.
Do Poltava next 🇸🇪🇷🇺
NNN must have been a rough one this year judging by that ending xD
"Scheme Mode" looks great!
Bro his sponsor transitions are so clean you can't even see them coming.
This is great. Very few people mention the war of independence was largely about America wanting to expand at the natives expanse, but the British saying no.
america's death:0 britiains death:1
USA USA USA USA USA USA 🇺🇸 !!!!!!
31:01 I DIED HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I died laughing at this
You know there are historians other than Howard Zinn right? Even some first hand sources!
That ending was the most American thing I've seen since America the motion picture
Florida being the US's dick is the funniest thing I've seen
something abaout this seems familar
I’m kinda with harney cause me likey the shooty shooty bang bang
The placement of Florida on the stick figure US kills me everytime 🤣
7:57
Dude! Your content is legit amazing! Such a huge fan
IT TOOK 6 MONTHS FOR THIS
WAR......
OINKE
27:26 whether the US Canada border look like this Or like this. I see what he did there.😉
your back:D
33:29 In 1 sentence "All of this enraged Winfield Scott who punished him severely"
Cannadian,the Yanks are coming !!!!!!!!!!
mate we could just burn the white house down again
As someone who's never heard of this before this was a pretty enthralling and gripping story, I was actually nervous of a war about to break out. Also makes you think about how many old historic wars probably had petty trigger points.
That ending tho lmao
Does it involve pigs?
Why was this the best video you’ve made so far. The talking pig XD
Oversimplified: Do you like giving strangers your passwords to your most important online accounts? me: YES Oversimplified: Me Neither! me: what
genuinely at the last part i got very scared
Boy, that escalated quickly
i can see why it took him longer than usual to make this one, the napoleonic wars and prohibition probably left him needing a break, and also, its just made better in general, ill always support your amazing content oversimplified!
if this war breaks out, does that mean we would have a chance for a better healthcare system?
33:28
Piggest war of wall...
when you realize upper canada is farther south than lower canada
Yayyyyyyyy new eposide
Well Great now Canada is going to be ready, hope they don't do something crazy like build a wall along the border
3:33 Florida is a Dick
Canadians best! Also, you should actually make a video that regards Canada.
Please do one for the the War of 1812
That awesome but can ask a favour can do history on Canada if it okay
12th grade girls: ugh, I hate doing math work  12th grade boys: 10:55
24:24 || 33:29 30:39 7:58
6:24 Yes BTS I am an army
We don't need to own Canada, we already own them in professional hockey and thus their soul.
British people: try to live American’s: Puts down a freaking McDonalds
The ending  makes us Canadians  justified in the use of beaver forts to defend ourself.
I’m Canadian watching the end of the video I’m just speechless like how do I react . I actually giggled a little bit but when you mentioned the maple strip I stopped and when at slight anger mode
Breakup of Yugoslavia pleaseee
Why don’t u post more?
Chill out, eh?
Ive visited both the American and british camps on San Juan Island
Charlie Hopkinson is an awesome impressionist! His Morgan Freeman is one of the best
My school recently did a play adaptation of this story, but they cut alot of the details for time. They just had Lyman and Douglas getting along instead of all the stuff with Pickett. It was pretty good but I liked this better. Also America should totally invade Canada that would be epic
The ending so beautiful
Best video to date, amazing
I would give a kidney to see this guy do a video about the life of Elizabeth I
Babe wake up oversimplified uploaded
36:06, what did Douglas do with Spaghetti Jeff?
Please don’t make us wait another 7 years.
This is and will always be the best argument to invade Canada in US history
Let’s go!!!!
"That's right Canadians, watch your backs." LOL pure gold
37:22   México: "umm, América, buddy just calm down there" *turns head and whispers* somebody get the UN on the phone! We don't want the whole continent to end up like Puerto Rico and Cuba!"
Stay out of Canada or we will burn down your house! Again. Great video btw
Someone should make HOI4 mod of this. It would be funny!
is that a Papers Please reference???
No russia will get you and china to so they will occupy america
you make it sound like the war of 1812 started solely because of American Imperialism when in actuality it began because of a combination of American Imperialism and the British Govt/Army  not respecting America as a nation.
HES BACK
Have to say, 31:54 has some balls
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting lifeRomans 10 : 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
This is just the movie Pig
do technoblade's potato war
Man changed his accent to a freedom lovin patriot🇺🇸
19:12 The part where he has memories about him and the pig always makes me laugh when I think about it.
I know this can be hard for you, but please make a video about Vietnam war if you can, I will always gladly hear your opinion and if you are making that video, I will always wait for it. God bless you and everyone.
I'm from Whatcom county I didn't realize Pickett was involved in the pig war, I knew his house is in bellingham but I had always thought he came here after the Civil War, thanks for covering this since this areas history always seems be ignored.
Look out Canadians! Were coming for you and your syrup!
They want Canada. But they forgot that Canada never lost a war.
11:53 we see what you did there lol
What if you do a video of Colombia
you're teaching us history in a fun way
The good American ending at the end
falklands war: american version
Good, now do the Nigerian civil war Ps this is not an order but a joke
Americans just have to ask "can we invade Canada?" and canadians can't say no cause they are too polite
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting lifeRomans 10 : 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
Dude the quality gets better every video
Holy shit its been long since I watched you
00:59 "INDEPEDENCE BABY"
Let's Go Brandon, Eh
A pig who likes potatoes started a war? Hmmmmmmm sounds like Technoblade
BYRON IS COMING
Well fun fact in the fallout game universe the US actually annexes Canada not too long before the the nuclear war.
As a Canadian, I am more then happy to let the USA invade as long as we aren’t forced to be Democrats
I wonder how'd he get famous for rarely uploading videos
It was a great video. But sometimes I couldn't tell if it was a joke or just dump acting in history
Bruh this is what we’re studying on in my history class.
It really hit differently when the pig was eating spuddy
I dont know how were gonna do it but we will take Canada
If a pig stood up on it's hind legs and started talking like Morgan Freeman I think I would react the same, at most I could plea insanity
The world is still clamoring to know what Henry meant by duckies…
Hey men, i wish you could post more videos often, its so entertaining
Did anyone know, what name of song in ? 19.12
Ironically I got a star wars ad just as the video started, what could this mean...
Good video, kinda wish there was more on the Native American perspective, but overall good
Oversimplified is the spokesmen and South Park is the propaganda for the Us-Canadian Disagreement
Omg, I got introduced by Ludwig and had to watch the whole thing!
Bruh this is by far my favorite episode 😂😂
Where have you been at I miss watching your videos  for all these months 😢
I remember on el elementary school we were supposed to do I don’t remember, it was a group project and one of us found something called “pig war” we laughed all day we just imagined peppa pig as a soldier we laughed so much they had to separate us, we probably failed that project
The NordVPN character looks like an e-boy
We're coming for you Canadians.
I officially move to have the last 3 mins of this video be an official declaration of war 😂😂😂
Lmao the end
I really would like to see a video on the Mexican-American War
The ending was so based lol
So happy to see  new video
You should do the Vietnam war
You should do the Vietnam war
Now about Point Roberts...
29:10 me playing hide and seek
I swear, this video is so good I have watched it everyday since it has released.
Oversimplified-always coming in my life when I’m about to forget them…and I love them for that
Literally why i get an A+ in Social Studies
Somewhat entertaining Video but not as Entertaining as it could have been, I Dislike this Video
Are you ok?
see you guys in june
this is the way a particular turn of events is occurring, eh?
Was not expecting the end lmfao
as a fellow canadian. im no afraid with joe biden trying to invade us
He posted before Christmas YAYY
This was his funniest vid yet, I’m dying laughing as we speak
Plot Twist: Brandon gives Canada to the Taliban.
Man this guy never talks about Bulgaria.
Les go I waited u for the past month
Lets go, Brandon!! Invade Canada!! 🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
This is really cool, I actually live on Vancouver Island and I never knew this story
5:56
Me being a true loyal Canadian and being kind honest and saying sorry after every sentence has to say that i have not laughed this hard in years.
Come on man,  if you didn't like this video you aren't black.
I am so happy that I stumbled across this channel. My daughter loves this  (She is 8 1/2) and we both get to learn new things. We can have conversations afterward over what we have watched. If I taught World history, I would definitely use these things in my classroom as a primer to larger topics. Keep up the excellent work!
Ironic all these anti-Canadian sentiments from someone who _sounds_ like a Canadian. No doubt a Midwesterner, or from the Great Lakes states, or even Pennsylvania, but all the same; ironic.
How to get me to unsubscribed: Less history, more attempts at humor, and fill it with ads and forced ads.   😕 all my favorite channel turns into trash once they get bigger
They hey now your a rockstar parody song was awesome I'd love to see more of it
WTF Man😂😂 The end was hilarious
Politics are stupid
wow the US seems like kind of an [?!?]hole
I missed you man
That ending tho
Oh my god, that cringy joke at the beginning, and got to love how it contradicts itself in the first 3 minutes of video.
watch out cananada we’re coming
At 3:35 look at Florida.😲
Canada>America always
technoblade?!?!?!
Best one yet, that was fantastic 🦾
Best channel on Youtube!
@Technoblade
what the heck it was the quebec boys that burned down that fecal matter hut that is called a "PrEsIdEnTs hOusE"
Makes my week when I see oversimplified uploads
I grew up and live on Whidbey Island, south of the San Juan’s, in Washington state and we learned about the pig war in school  lol didn’t think anyone else knew about this
That McDonald’s made me crack a smile
how about  split the ilsand like the faklands
As a proud Canadian who lives in south Vancouver island I am thankful that the border did not continue in a straight line
32:01 I'm sorry, but this has to be a reference to goofy's trial. The voice has similar accent and it has similarities to one of the lines.
By golly, that was an informative video! That ending though... was legendary.
And people still believe in God's 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks man as usual u didn't disappoint keep up awesome work 👍🏻
next please do Andrew Jackson oversimplified cover his highs and his lows
Just leaving a comment that I left a dislike since the button doesn’t matter anymore.
its me(:
Sorry, but I am ready to invade Canada
Pls make a video about mexican American war
BAAAAAACK
The Day of the Rake is long due.
ah yes, the americans and brits. a beautiful match made in hades.
*Laughs in Washingtonian*
Oversimplified's self loathing is pathetic. The revisionist history based in millennial ethnocentrism doesn't take the world view as it was. And no, I'm not buying NORD VPN.
uh what the pig war
7:58 We need a full cover of Oversimplified All Star!
Could you do Texas History
As always, I love your content. Way to educate, my guy! Keep on keeping on!
10 years from now..."The Maple syrup war oversimplified"
i tought u were dead
please make more vids
A video of the Venezuelan crisis of 1895 and also the naval blockade of 1902-03 would be good
I like how higher ups more or less said "just don't start a war."
Canada's been real quiet since this one dropped
I mean, who really likes Canada anyway?
Damn, I haven't seen oversimplified rant outside of his narrating voice before
That ending was amazing
After this Inspiring call to arms, my friends and I have all signed up for the military to fulfill manifest destiny.
HE’S BACK
I laughed so hard when you said the border would look like this or look like this, and nothing changed
I live in Oregon 😳
Can y’all please do the Vietnam War PapaSimplified?
BRAVO 👏🏻. THE ENDING WAS AMAZING🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
“I didn’t say they were *white* people.” That is the best
KNOW YOUR PLACE CANADIANS!!!!!
Dis funny asf breh 😂
The joy every (varying) months when I get my history lessons from a man on the internet who seems more certified then most teachers gives me overwhelming happiness.
that pig wasnt shot. Maybe it couldve led us to space colonization today.
The American Destiny 😂
Damn Americans really are kinda jealous of Canada
Joe bidens face at the end is legitimately creepy, like seriously.
The picture is brilliant and my history teacher said “everything you watched is all facts kids.”
HE IS BACK!
I want another vedio they are just to good
POV: you got the all star reference in the episode
nah sorry, im out of jars
Yooooo the intro was THE ONE 😂😂😂😂😂😂
views on this chanel are insane wtf
16:00 Americans use AK-47....
WAIT THIS IS THIRD ON TRENDING LETS CONTINUEEEEEEEE
Can you please do the Texas Revolution?
Can you do the Civil War!!!! Please!!!!
I grew up on that small island, San Juan and I can confirm this is the first war we were taught in elemntary school. Every year, after our Fourth of July Parade we hold our "Pig War Picnic" at the Historical Museum on the island, its a long standing tradition.
As a British Columbian, I can tell you that WE ARE ON TOP BABYYYY!#1 LESS GOOO (geographically and mentally.)
you may have nuclear bombs but we have the Canadian geese their is mass. can attack by air, land and sea while putting in lots of damage and also being imune to radiation damage and a nuclear blast
This ending gives Biden so much credit I died laughing
Oh OH OOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! A new upload! THERE IS A GOD!!!!
This legend account has back
y'know I thought this was techno at first
You have outdone yourself
Where is the Vietnam oversimplified video can we have it pls and thank you
He’s not even taking my moose army seriously
All my plans are now cancelled. Oversimplified has uploaded.
Wait so America could have gotten Canada too?(btw American almost annexed Mexico but didn’t because they saw the Mexicans as inferior)
14:36 😂😂
The nord VPN ad 😂😂😂
The mole george
Oink!
Anyone wanna go on a group field trip to San Juan?
I HATE starwars, every time I see a star or a war I want to murder children
37:35 😂
How do you mention the pig War without even mentioning the birds
You should make a video about the dictator from chile Augusto Pinochet
that ending are marbolous
Griffin was the only one who suffered
"but the Americans start coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running, it didn't make sense to 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗢𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝟲-𝟭  spittin fax
Soberbio!
I've never wanted to invade Canada more than this moment! Enlisting now! 🇺🇸
Do the potato war
When the Morgan Freeman😍
When next video?
I think oversimplified neds help
I subscribed for the star wars thumbnail.
Morale of the story stay strapped or get clapped
thats when Biden forgets which way Canada is and invades Mexico lol
3:36 give him his density.
do some ancient roman stuff. Would love to see an oversimplified video on the octavian v antony conflicts and wars, or the assassination of caesar
i never see nordvpn coming in your video but since you say computer,i do
5:14  Interestingly enough, 1 of the only 3 natural ports on the West Coast was also there, and it was a big deal that the US and Canada were debating about- it wasn't only the river
THANK YOU
OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG
over simplified can you make a video on scipio africanus pls
That ending was...American.
such a good ending
I like how during lunch at school we can get on the computer so i went to your channel and watched the civil war part 1 and some people even watched with me lol
VPNs are all scams.
I’m in oregon
Islands are definitely Canadian
Pretty sure he is Canadian
The pig reminds me of Waddles from Gravity Falls
At the end was oversimplified discussing state secrets
you're just too good man
It could be a 100 years from now or a 1000 but best believe we're coming for your syrup Canada. 🇺🇸
hey oversimplified can you do a video on the mexican american war
Soooo.... we just gonna skip over Point Roberts? The poor Americans currently trapped by Canadians?
you have no chill in the end and i love it
Dude you really surprised meeeeeeeee
this is so funny but the end scared the socks(Yes socks not any swearing) out of me!
Breaking news a man going by the name of OverSimplified is committing atrocities in Canada
What was fun about this one is that I could sneak a peak at spoilers on google maps.
So now thats two wars started because of weak fences
Oversimplified has blessed us with his great content!
TECHNOBLADE WARS POTATOS YESSS
Watched it
WHAT TOOK SO LONG FOR YOU TO UPLAD LMAO
Be shitty colonial nation.  Believe you have divine destiny to conquer from sea to sea  and build the greatest country the world had ever seen.  Somehow actually do it.  Still have people question your divine destiny.    Maybe its about time to have the divine destiny to push to a 3rd ocean.
That was an epic ending!
I have no idea about india and indian histroy add new video about indian culture and histroy
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VID LETS GO
Is that morgan freeman? 31:02 😂😂
Its an awesome video. But I would have preferred it if topics such as the Three Kingdoms and the American Revolution could be longer. For example , you kinda generalised most of the Three Kingdoms and focus on the early stages of it. The period lasted for 70 years and there was a lot more to talk about. Such as the Five Northern Campaigns by Shu or the Sima coup in Wei
The ending is epic LoL😂😂🤣
DOWN WITH CANADA
never would i expect oversimplified to ever so passionately threaten an entire country on the behalf of the united states
divine density. :)
i love this
United world of America
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OVERSIMPLIFIED WHAT OF HISTORY SERIES
36:04 Bismarck likely would have joined in woth celebratory handgun firing.
27:27 is the best 😂😂
That smashmouth reference was hilarious
7:57 My man got possessed by Smash Mouth
Are you threatening Canada
37:18 Probably because the US would get glassed by other powers if they tried.
well I mean it would be nice if you could mention Canada more but so far you've mentioned us more than a Disney documentary so thank you, and I eagerly await your next video!
37:16 is when the "invade Canada" tangent begins
"being americans they pulled out guns on him"
BECAUSE BIDEN'S COMING BABY. AND HE'S COMING... WITH A VENGEANCE.
Holy shit the production value
It just keeps getting better
You should definitely make a 7 year war video I think it a really cool war and some consider it the first world war Please like so he makes it
“Sleep with one eye open, because biden is coming” This can be taken more than one way, and im not sure which is worse
How tf did even the German Empire get involved in this shit
Wow, did not expected all that targeting at Canada at the end 😂
Wait a second, I didn't say they were *white* people. Me: Hol'up
Finally
POV:  *Oversimplified uploads* Auto clicks cause you know it's gonna be entertaining, funny and accurately informative on history.    P.S. WE ALMOST WENT TO WAR OVER A PIG?!?! BAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
Please, we need a video about the Mexican - American War!
Harney is the most badass in American history
That’s about as perfect of a way to end a video as I have ever seen! 😂
That ending was probably the most emotional OverSimplified has been... ever
Goof the island above Vancouver was stilled colored red and blue after the straight line was declared
Hey now we can't invade Canada.  Where would we say we're moving to when we don't like our politics?  Mexico?
if america takes over our land, hoo boy... america would fall apart from the sheer unrest
37:46 LOL,That's the Egyptian Emblem.
Keep your politics in your ass unsubscribed
You should do a Seven Years War oversimplified.
why do u gotta be so mean at the end of the video i honestly feel sad from that.
spooky shit
I need a “these white people sure love beavers” on a t shirt
“The only casualty of this war was the pig” DON’T FORGET SPUDDY
The ending is normal just think about it.
Yall should post more often! Great videos
biden sucks
Most of that for a pig? Those blundering fools.
Just another amazing piece by oversimplified
"Woah woah woah, I never said they were WHITE people"
The ending sold me. Let's get the ball rolling on World War 2.5
33:20 my favorite part
how did i miss this
yesssss id been craving an oversimplified video
“These white people sure love beavers”
I’m curious how he would explain Eugenics
Listening to Beatles music scrolling through recommended. *Sees PIG WAR from OVERSIMPLIFIED*  Eh, sure, why not.
New video yay
You should do Vietnam oversimplified
U Ned to post more vids!
Can you mention Canada in the next video? You dont talk about Canada enough
😂Damn that ending, absolute fire🔥 These Oversimplified vids are a gift to Humanity 👍🏾
Winfield Scott is hugely underrated. He shaped the future of the US armed forces. His campaign in Mexico and reforms to the US army had every US officer wanting to be like him.
Woah that was very dark in the end
Let’s go
That ending hahahahahah
Finnaly a new video
you should do a video on Simon Bolivar!!
Yo what oversimplified made a video
Every video is worth the wait
You should do William Wallace
Cool
Take back Canadian Corridor to Alasca!   Because, what could possibly go wrong!?
No way new video awesome
Who else gets excited when you see him on your recently added?!
Could replace 90% of public education history teachers without even breaking a sweat.  Beautiful content.
"Lyman... SHOT THE PIG!!!!!!!"
6:40 a
11:15 hearing an echo flashback of the iconic "no" scream is so pleasing to hear
Oversimplified please don't make fun of the killed pig.
37:08
"They went to arrest the customs official, but being an American, he came out with four pistols and a large knife, so they let him go"  I love a happy ending.
that last minute.... that was ur speech? Pathetic come, try ur luck
Holy shit, that ending.
all of canada unsubscribed
Best video yet!
Idea, why not do Opium wars next?
At about 22:20 I noticed you had the letter go through the Panama Canal, which at the time did not exist
I'm sensing a bias
Holy shit what's with the ads... You lost me within the first 22 seconds. Bye
This man lost it, some one help!!!!!
Let’s just trade Alberta and Saskatchewan for Oregon, Washington state, and New England.
face reveal
“Biden’s coming babe” and this time he’s gonna touch your kids 😂  Bidens a dirty old man
America purchased the land they settled. Saying it was an invasion is historical revisionism.   You’re confusing the United States with the native tribes who genocided the previous occupants when they occupied the land.   But that’s not politically correct. Therefore the truth doesn’t matter.
I wait MONTHS for these types of videos.... AND ITS WORTH IT
Aye if might have taken months for a new video but they worth it
Based Imperial Germany
I love this so much, that ending though
The end got me laughing🤣
I honestly thought this was called 'Oversimpified' and was going to be about how sensitive everyone has become in America, thus eventually leading to a potential civil war arbitrarily named 'The Pig War'.  Couldn't have been more off.
Canadians be proud
He’s back men
I freaking love my new homeland.  ❤️America is the best!❤️
These videos are reaching family guy levels of stupidity. I’m very disappointed.
And I get to see the San Juan Islands ever day ^_^
me just happy my small ass home in Washington got mentioned.  over simplefied going on a two minute rant about canada and a pig and bidens vengances.
It is truly a treat when you post
29:17 that muffled scream from behind the curtain... can't stop laughing every time I hear it 🤣
When is the next video?
Honestly, the Americans can have the San Juan islands, but Canada should really get Alaska. It just makes more sense to be part of Canada.
I love this channel
“Americans TRY to invade Canada and the British burn down the White House” 😂
see yall in june
Never thought about it before but I want drake to be our president now.
HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ALL STAR REFFRENCE
Wtf I'm canadian
This whole video is so libtarded its not even funny
Order  order shut up
Amazing video
14:40
Oversimplified has spoken let the glorious war for Canada begin!!!!!!!!!
You have successfully lost a Canadian subscriber
America conquering Canada would scarily make alot of sense...
OverSimplified has got to be one of the funniest and informative videos on YouTube! My wife and I LOVE it! History has NEVER been more fun!
Nnooooooooo
Hello @Oversimplified can you make a video about the Magellan - Elcano Expedition....because it was almost 500 years when the Ship Victoria returned to Spain after almost 3 years of circumnavagating the Earth.   In our country, we were celebrating 500 years of Christianity and we remember the first landing of Ferdinand Magellan in the Philippine Soil last March 16, 2021.   Lastly, I am looking forward to have some videos uploaded by Oversimplified that also focuses in more history in some countries...Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Italy, the Philippines etc.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊   I really appreciated in your videos not only in teaching us history, but also give entertainment😊😊😊 Keep it up...!!!!!
That sponsor work in was smooth as fuck! 🤣👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
This amount of likes lmao
Viking Age content pls
ABOUT TIME!
General Scott is the first reasonable I've witnessed in all of this channel's videos.
Could you do the Texas Revolution please.
Watch your back Canada we’re on our way
Yes
Huh, had no idea about this. Interesting.
I agree
such fun
7:58 to 8:02, I need a full version of this all star parody it’s too good
Hey now your a rockstar
Pig War: Started over an island for shooting a pig, almost brought USA and UK to war, stopped the crisis because of level-headed minds and officers. Cuban Missile Crisis: Started over Nukes in Cuba, almost brought USA and USSR to war, was stopped because of level headed minds and officers Me: That's some real-life plagiarism
“Being American, ____ pulled out guns”. One of the most useful sentences when talking about American history
Yes please invade canada, please save canada from Trudeau and his reign of tyranny
Do Mexican war
I wish OverSimplified did more history involving Canada, we have lots to share and interesting stuff in our history but other then in Canada not a lot is not mentioned to the rest of the world.. we are important too😂😅
Don't worry Canadians. For us to invade, biden would have to be able to find you on the map, and that's giving him credit for a bit too much mental capacity.
I see Brits and Americans could no longer make fun of the Australians for the Emu War 😂  They have the Pig War 😂
Well, if the Alberta separatism movement gains steam America may make northern gains.
Still waiting on that Vietnam war video you mentioned in your cold war video all those years ago... and do you think you could do another less known but modern war like the Congo war pls?
Guys lets get all politics out of this and leave this between us in the comments section. OBVIOUSLY, the islands and even possibly at least 3/4's of Vancouver belong to the U.S. Like it's only fair. Let's prove we can resolve this rationally as citizens of our country's people.
Those transitions are too good
As a Canadian I feel generally terrified lmao
Brainlet-tier take on what Manifest destiny meant to settlers and how it was popularized
MolimolimolimoliMOLAYYYYYYY!
number 3 in sweden les goooo
not everything America did was out of evil intentions... funny I always thought this place was a great way to get away from the shit public schools teach, Except all you do is teach the same thing except funny animations and nord VPN. If I wanted people to tell me how horrible white people and United States is, and how perfect everyone else was is I’ll just turn on  the TV.
We've been waiting for months for this episode lol.. and it was worth it.
In all honesty I know Canadians hate us I would hope we could create the C.U.M. Republic
1:52 2:45 2:55 5:00 6:53 8:42 15:38 35:50 37:15
do the roman empire
Yes. Finally some Irish related historical figures 11:43 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Can you make a video on the war of 1812
It is surprising how America foreign policy is still as it was then lol
“That’s a perfectly sound solution that would benefit both parties…and IM NEVER GOING TO AGREE WITH IT!!!” - the most American sentence to ever exist
I didn't expect that ending XDDD
Famous last words before the sponsor “WHAT THE FU-“
Ok
I love this video but in my opinion oversimplified should make videos about major conflicts or periods. I think this war is quite insignificant and probably it wasn't worth it to make a 38 minute video clip about it.
Animal farm prequel
23:43 IRA signs in the 1970s
Sorry, i am a big fan of this channel, but found this episode difficult to get through.  I felt it was trying too hard to be "wacky" in a way that previous episodes didn't.
Anyone else sad that it’s just 1 video 😭
You’re a genius dude
please do the battle of ridegway next
Rip Porky :((
Sooo you think it’d be better the land stay with warring tribes who scalped people for trophies and made human sacrifices?  I’m glad America took the land.
That was the best ending to a video EVER
Wtf did I witness with that ending
I got fallout vibes from the last minute of the vid
If America actually takes over Canada , it might just fix Biden.
Lyman: take your dang pig out   Griffin and i took that personally
The us expanding its Lebensra- I mean manifesting their destiny
The replay of the live comment is Amazing!! USA USA USA!!
It’s a little thing about America’s manpower is dying down because America is not as strong as they used to
pls dont envade canada it wouldnt be fair in hockey
4:10 America... **Chef's kiss**
I love history, I love my country, I love this channel… but no way in H. E. double hockey sticks would Canada ever become American territory.   Also. PLEASE! Put more content out sooner. It’s so good and entertaining, just wish there was more to watch!! Great job!
Honestly, 32:31 is the perfect mass dissing. I wish I could say it to people who deserve it  just for the sheer pleasure of saying it!
FUCK YEAH! GOD BLESS AMERICA!
Vietnam War oversimplified when?
People: Star Wars has the most evil Sith Lords.   Pig War: Hold my potato, then give it back cause pigs gotta eat
Where tf is a technoblade reference. You had a perfect opportunity to put in the pig who starts wars
2 sides of the same lying, deceiving, globalist coin
When I watched the end. It changed me because I’m Canadian.
Leyend has it that the dumb general is Joe Biden's ancestor
Ay that's neat. I've been inside lymens house when I biked San Juan
Well worth the wait...thanks OS
why does your plush look like a snowman
I noticed that the list of disputes you showed that the Americans and British had at the end of the Civil War included the Fenian Raids. Could you perhaps do a video about those?
Officially OverSimplified has lost his mind with the knowledge of history.  The burden of knowledge weighs heavy on his soul rofl :D
Congratulations to Winfield Scott for being one of like three people involved to have a functioning brain
28:04 HMMM
Your channel is the perfect example of "quality over quantity"
Comment for the algorithm
I feel like I’m always on the British side on any conflict involving the 2 powers and that the US is extremely stupid.
OverSimplified... THAT WAS THE BEST ENDING TO A VIDEO IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
Man I actually felt really bad when he found out the pig died...
The Falklands part 2
dont think he talked about canada enough this video
When we needed him the most, he came back  Some unoriginal youtube comment thing
it was America's density
We want More 👍👍
Great job!
The Canadians better run
The king Hass returned!!
Best ad intros on YouTube hands down
They could have called it The Boar War ........with a touch of british ironic humour lol
Yeah we shouldve left them to eating each other
31:35 Mobster pig 33:20 Pyscopath
I was just crying because by cat attacked me but the video distracting me from the pain
I am scared
Running out of ideas, aye?
I, A canuck, just laughs. but..oh boy.... Great vid though...I...erm...uhh....CANADA BOIIIIIIIII
Do the war of 1812
I would to see the Irish war of independence
“You can head over to South Korea and watch every single BTS video known to mankind,” IM DYING HELP 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣
as least he says :look at that canada not: ew look at that canada :)
That ending upped my blood sugar so high!
Finally he’s back
Harney looks like Kenneth Brannagh LMAO
Let me guess, someone stole your pig?
spuddy
You should do the Mexican revolution
It’s better to have the best people to win the control of the world. Why would you want the loser of conflicts to win if they’re not the best? If they don’t believe in healthy societies why do you want them to win?
Im canadien and scared 😭😂
Yesssss finally
SING IT WITH ME 🎶OH GRAND NATIONALISM🎶
Britain wanted the islands.....        Which angered the United States, who punished them severely
Us: Wow whatever Oversimplified has been working on for half a year must be good!  Oversimplified: PIG
I used to live there as a little kid and my dad once told me about a supposed "War over a single pig", but I never learned about it... until now...
what is the sence of germany decide? it shold be Portugal
I love how Layman cocks a double barrel shotgun
hes backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I’ll burn ur White House down again 😂 and stop giving u maple syrup
That pig was the first Oversimplified character with actual legs 31:47
Everyone is talking about the end of this video, but no one is talking about pickett answering the phone with his Iron and burning himself
Marxist* Version of History Oversimplified Simplified
This is the first time you have covered a topic I had literally never heard even the slightest thing about. Think it’s my favourite yet. Well done sir.
This video got me looking at a map of the country I live in.
HI
I just had to write a paper on this, why didn't it come sooner😔
I came for a pig now we are invading Canada with Drake as president
SUIII
38 minutes, jesus, no wonder u haven't posted in 6 months
Yay this fire 🔥
If they had the mind, just let it go
Hail satan, he has returned!
funny but Only slightly liberal view of it huh
31:03 I swear I thought Morgan freeman voiced the pig
17:31 Ahhhhh!!!!!
Thanks for another video <3
Do the Israeli-Palestine wars next pls
Lyman makes technoblade look sain
03:30 - I dare you to say the same thing about Muslims.
ok you can deal with the French separatists
turning the nordvpn logo into the blue haired guy was BRILLIANT! when i first saw him he seemed quite out of place, like a hipster....and them boom....the revelation that he was just the personification of the logo.......
i’ve fallen into a state of depression, my social studies teacher refused to play oversimplified in class
My god that ending took a left fucking turn
HE BACK BABY
Not even one dislike this guy is unbelievable
4:12 The Native American's revenge: build Casinos
I was raised in the Pacific Northwest and learned about this in school.  But this is much better.
@OverSimplified fun fact there was another border disagreement with the British in New Hampshire. They decided to put the top border at the source of the coneticut river but disagreed on the source. So the disputed area referred to as the Indian stream area fell in a strange predicament where they were being taxed by both USA and England through Canada they succeeded as a republic until finally being claimed by the U.S. and now that town known as Pittsburg NH has the most land of any municipality in New England.
Next one about the nigerian civil war please. The geopolitics of that thing are mind boggling (USA and the USSR in the same team lmao)
You should animate live :D
It’s very seemly that Harney would want to be President.  I have never seen a sane adult that wanted to be President.
37:08 gotta be the funniest thing I seen from oversimplified
best ending ever
Wilbur soot song be like: boom
Please liberate us  T. Canuck
this video makes me want to re watch the prohibition video
lmao you really out did yourself on this one. Love it.
Cam you do the Zulu war next please?
are you pro Biden?
The end of this video is gold
Toledo war oversimplified?
3:06 I thought I accidentally rewind the video
Oversimplified: so you want me to talk more about Canada …..fine  Canada 🇨🇦 🍁 : why do I hear boss music Eh
Show oversimplified some love so we can get another video put boi's.
I can appriciate the waddles from gravity falls design for the pig, i suppose it's because it's taking place in oregon
cringe. this whole thing.
8:00 shrek reference
That was mables pig anyways
What happened to you? Used to be semi-neutral fun content and facts about history but now this is video with heavy political message that im just so tired of listening.
those plush designs are the most stupidest ever! I'll take a thousand
The king has returned and blessed us again
Is that real?
Now you see, I don’t like where this is going…
If the US conquer Canada then Quebec will do it's own thing and form it's own country. We even threatened Canada multiple times about our separation and they had to consider us because of how heavily it would affect the federal income. But now unstead of 31m english taxes payers it was 360,5m, our weight would be miniscule. We have the diplomatic right to claim independance.
It’s been to long
The thumbnail looks like it came from the Star Wars poster lmao
Please make more plushies
Omg I can't believe it's a new video
When men cried: 18:39
This is basically politics rn  13:29
Hahaha best ending ever
Can you do one about how belgium got independace from the netherlands
14:35 LMAOOO this is the funniest part of the video 🤣🤣
*sniff sniff* potatoes
This was brilliant!!   Also, as an English person who married an American and now lives in Tennessee I can say without prejudice or bias, that those islands DEFINITELY should belong to England.  It was a travesty that the Americans got them! A travesty, I tell you! Also, that ending was wholly unexpected and absolutely hilarious. =D
Will anyone acknowledge that the excursion boat at 26:26 is named "Steamer McSteamy Face"?
Us are evil
If you attacked Canada you'd also have to deal with Britain because we're technically still a part of the British Empire and you probably have to deal with a close Ally in France and Germany and you know Europe you'll have to fight all of Europe which you won't win
18:44 top 10 saddest anime moments
Welp see you in 6 months
when a YouTube channel is better than an actual education.
I mean those dirty buffalos did kinda have it coming…
american indian wars
Joe Biden drank a glass of water, but he made a huge mistake! It was not infact a glass of water. No! It was a glass of Obama! And his body's economy went down! He really shot himself in the toilet in the Canadian war! Just in the toilet for now!     Why you shouldn't share anything publicly when you should be sleeping but are watching a youtube video.
Oh wow. What's wrong with Canada 🇨🇦
wonder why the british didnt help the south to get rid of the constant rival.
7:58 what a random Smash Mouth reference.
3:30 - sigh, after I watched this a second time, I saw Florida on the stick figure. Basically, where Florida is located, speaks for all of America right there and then.
I feel like oversimplified is losing his mind and we are just letting it happen
He used the same animation in the probation
Awesome video but I'm not looking forward to waiting another year for the next video
OUR
The Canada rant at the end was sponsored by our government
6:21 YES BTS IS COOL
Bonus: If you look at these islands on Google Earth, there's barely anything there, even today.
Buchanan is my great great great great grand uncle
Can’t wait for Mr.Terry reaction to this video
We only say our countries' better because it is. Its just fact XD
Yeah Oversimplified is back
37:52 i'm dead 😂😂😂
YYYYAAAAAAAYYYY Oversimplified is back!!!!!
Shit went ham
that transition to a sponsor was so smooth
Lol
This is a masterpiece
Oversimplified POG!
Aftet that ending, I will never complain that you don't talk about Brazil
5 stars
OS smoked some serious FREE'DUM  WEED on that last statement
Based Western Expansion
We need balkan wars
I’m sure Techno loves this video
Soo whens Vietnam coming out?
I hear the extreme nationalism calling... We need more than Canada. It's time them Mexicans realized who's in charge 😏
It could be tomorrow or a thousand years from now, but if we ever get into a conflict with Canada, I blame this video
23:30
Ok I think you’re taking a little too far about Canada be all United States, I think that Canada  just be Canada and let United States just be United States 😣
Panama Canal was first used in 1914, so this letter 22:17 was either sent down the Magallanes Canal, south of Argentina, or across the country by horse. Do not know which one was faster o if it took only 6 weeks to do it.
Is it just me or does the pig in this video look like waddles from Gravity Falls
We would have true peace is they showed this in history classs
This is annoyingly political
7:25 no one British would pronounce British as “Briddish” evidence: I’m British
Wow, so that's the Bay of Pigs invasion? Crazy...
A riddle🤣😂🤣
ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS I HATE YOU! I ALWAYS HATE YOU!
The sherrif is hilarious
Canada is nice
When the Americans went to put up the flag in the British camp, only to find the British had taken the flagpole. You couldn't write it any better
I’m just studying this now for midterms. Thank you so much
Does Nord VPN cost money?
cotten being loss
Very sad times
Could you make a video about the Ottoman Empire next please?
Bruh I live at the Mississippi River lol he is gonna show my house isn’t he
5:01 Vietnam map on the table? Hm.
Gotta appreciate how flexible Canada was with the Americans when disputing over the border. Canada could have had more land but they decided to stay at peace with the Americans.
people will negotiate with sheep someday
Man no way America will even come remotely close to taking Canada (if they wanted to) with Biden. That doofus is like a puppet. He needs people to tell him what's even going on. On the other hand, Canada's Prime Minister, Trudeau is still a really big doofus that put the country in trillions of dollars in debt. Would be an interesting war if that ever happened.  If Trump were still President, that would be a completely different story. They'd definitely annihilate Canada. I know I should stay loyal to Canada, but I know I would fall if Trump took over our land.
Is it really oversimplified when it's a 38 minute video about a war that never happened over a pig on an island in the middle of nowhere?  Good video though.
I live in (formerly Fort) Vancouver, and that first Macdonald's from the 1800's is still a local landmard
The war of 1812 was not a draw, Canada exists, therefore Britain won
Bad stereo type
we should have just let the americans take canada. as a canadian i can say that modern day our country sucks major nutsack
3:31 sus
you can thank germany for the islands yeah
It's illegal to want reparations from third country
3:33 Florida's placement is absolutely perfect
This is definitely my favorite channel on YouTube. I'd support on Patreon if I had money, but I'm broke as fuck. Some day I will.
7:57 best moment
Simply epic!! 👏👏
Quality
LETS GOOO ANOTHER UPLOAD
No one ded except piggy boi RIP
Whoever put the double 15 second non skipable ad before my oversimplified video deserves an extra special place in hell
5:00 I SEE THE NES CONTROLLER ON CHAIR
I honestly thought OverSimplified was a Canadian with a strong interest in American history for ages. Damned if the end of this one didn't set me straight.
Dude you've gotten so much better with your animation skills!
3:54 it was probably cherls cat
28:42  Is that James Buchanan-
From about 37:25 on this becomes the greatest oversimplified video.
I feel like this is by far your best video yet
As a Canadian myself. I must say, that I’m sorry, sorry, about your anger towards us Tim lovers. Eh? BTW. I WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH BEFORE I LET YOU CALL MY MAPLE SYRUP AN AMERICAN SUCCULENT BEVERAGE.
Haha i live on Vancouver island
Can we get an ancient rome or ancient Greece?
"The British then went off to arrest the US customs inspector, but - being an American - he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife."  This is a real "proud to be an American" moment right here.
Steamy McSteam Face 😆😆
"Biden's coming baby! And this time, he's coming with a vengeance!" 🤣🤣🤣
I was so hungry for more content i watched every video you made but i loved them all keep up the good work!
I miss this
Imagine at the end if that was the actual declaration of war
12:33 Suddenly, I'm designing a kerbal space ship?
YESS
Interesting to note that James Douglas was mixed race and would be considered African American by US standards, so he is not entirely accurately represented here.
Here is what I would predict if America tried to invade Canada: First Canada's allies send soldiers (with Britain sending a small amount of troops) Then Russia seeing a weakened and distracted America invades Next Mexico and their central America allies invade Eventually the opportunistic European nations invade Then Britain invades and takes control central Europe due to their armies busy attacking America Finally America falls causing Russia to be the world superpower causing the weaker nations to become part of stronger nations causing a worldwide currency matter  Well that's what I believe would be the outcome
Dude how can you expect us to go a full 4 months in between videos, thats cruel and unusual treatment of us lowly folk. More videos lest Canada takes you by surprise and strikes first, you have been warned
Pig pig!!!
This is not the middle of the channel
the square rigger, exploding onto canadian shores with rootin tootin, pistol shootin, mobility scootin americans almost made me forget how many objects I had in orbit, good work!
This is the most American video I have ever seen
NOOOOOOOO CANADA
HI
I mean make the war of 1812 seriosly pig war
I loved the end tbh
Pls make a war of 1812 not nopleian
nord vpn works in brazil ???
See y’all again in 6 months
Please can you do about the sufferagettes they are amazing icons and went through several atrocities in prisons that people need to know about. Please🙏🙏🙏🥺😁🙏🙏🙏
Let's be happy for his return
You should do Vietnam
Are you going to make a video about the boxer rebellion?
22:18 But wasn’t the Panama Canal not constructed by then? Wouldn’t they need to circumvent the American continent to reach Washington D.C?
Can you make a  1930s the great depression I learned so much from your videos on this way it helps me so much on my test
I feel like Bismarck definitely flipped a coin when he heard what the dispute was about.
God bless NordVPN for supporting creators like you
I never knew about this until now. Man, I love history!
The animation gets better with more movement each video and I like that. It really shows the quality put into the video.
Welp I'm ready to invaded Canada, USA USA USA
I hadn't even heard of this war until now
I almost broke a rib laughing at this history told with humor........................................You sir are the man!!!
ngl, I clicked "LIKE" even before I've started watching the video.  Welcome back Oversimplified!
OS is back
So american civilians having a gun actually gives them more territory, this is actually genius to solve land problems in your area
10:26 did anyone else notice the Konosuba reference
Do the enlightenment
i live in canada
I thought this was going to be about tecnoblad
Pretty sure the pig’s voice when saying ‘Lyman, if you spare my life, I’ll grant you three wishes’ sounded very similar to Morgan Freeman’s voice
TECHNOBLADE
You know youll do an Irish video next and try to invade us but bad news we have a lot of irish americans. Russia thought planting kids there was a great idea we planted generations muhahahahahahahahahah
biden sucks as a president
This is halarious , but what about Egypt?!?!!!
Do the sengoku Jidai.
Serbians would say that there where whole World war over shooting of pig.
The ad placement lmao
The last minute and a half is going to give me nightmares as a Canadian.  Thank you. 😂
very funny lol . . . . .
33:29
US invasion of Panama 😎
Oh boy…
Great vid as usual
This is the biggest bullshit ever.  I love it.
That ending got me all hyped up and I'm not even American. Another great video!!!
i"m Canadian and i love this ending... expect please stay out of our country :)
The ending was the best
Did I just hear Morgan Freeman?! 🤣
Great, now we gotta wait 8 more months for the next video.
solid stuff
When you realise a war that never happened had a longer video than the great war
That ending was legendary
I'm into general Harney, that man was a hero.
A republican is going to watch this show and get offended by CRT 😂
Oversimplified’s greatest running gag: every time NordVPN sponsors him, he ALWAYS mentions the same video(s) he made that are blocked in some countries. Never before have I been hyped for a new video just to see if NordVPN is the sponsor
That "Manifest Destiny" is the most American thing I've ever heard.
26:04
I miss your videos
The ending I wished for 😤
Don’t eat technoblade, please!
Oversimplified videos are so rewatchable, I absolutely adore them
2022 - Canada declares war on Oversimplified. Not America, but the man himself.
Wait wait wait, Squaw Killer Harney was given a command in a potential hotspot? That's alarming.
As an American I'm gonna do whats well in my power pull a gun and ask you to back down 😂
that ending tho
Wow, not even a minute and already shitting on white people. That must be a record...
,😂😂😂is that Morgan Freeman in there? 😂😂
why does oversimplefied have so much energy in this vid, it feels like he snorted an entire ocean of cocaine, i mean, go to the last fiew seconds of the vid
I bet that Germans blocked the video about ww2, because they use Hitler as an excuse for no one to be able to see their history because they're ashamed.
I actually live right near there, if this never happened.. we wouldn’t have the ring, that movie took place there
Please do the Scottish wars of independence
You made 38 million people very mad
7:56 bro that little was🔥
I would get 100/100 in every exam If he was my teacher
Show someone 18:44 with zero context 🤣
So Pickett’s charge makes WAY more sense now
I love learning about various events in history, but I love it even more when it's presented in a fun way! This channel is superb, and I can't wait to see what you bring us next time!
I was never ready for the ending
You know this war woulda never happened if the americans wern't so patriotic and stubborn, eh?
I’ve never seen a more accurate representation of British parliament than at 10:40
Indians: scalp
Dear american  Please don't invade Canada, we'd rather not be apart of you.  From, Pretty much all of Canada   P.S. Even Quebec agreed. And they don't agree on anything
I dearly enjoyed this piece of art
the last part killed me lmao
How have I lived in North America most of my life and never heard about this? Oh my God ... XD
make a video on the turkish independence please <3 love this video amazing!
It's about damn time you made another video
we wil help you invade canada if we get new Netherlands and new Amsterdam
Too many jokes ngl
The ending was the best thing I’ve ever seen 😭😭
yaaaaaaah!!!!!!
good job!
god the animation is amazing
Pls do the fall of yoguslavia its so hard to understand so it needs to be oversimplified
I'm from Canada and would absolutely love if America took over.
8:49 is just beautiful
That ending was truly patriotic. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
why did I find the meme a few days ago and then suddenly
This is all 100% historically accurate including spuddy trust me
I would have preferred this to be an written article, but as a funny visual input it may give someone  a bad idea using a sharpie for the new border with Canada...
I am certain after this video end, it will immediately block in Canada after that ending. XD
I’m pretty sure some of the founders wouldn’t refer to the natives as people
Babe wake up, oversimplified uploaded.
WAS WAITING FOR THIS
We have more cheeseburgers than they have people. The moose folk don't stand a chance
I can already see oversimplified the war of 1812 coming up!
Why i like the end so much
More uploads
6 months letar
OverSimplified: Captain Hormy My brain for some fkin reason: Captain Horny lol
D: YO
12:10 gravity fall pig!
does anyone felt that in minute 7:58 the narrative sounds like the lyrics of all star
New narrator?
Make another video on opium war  It would be great 👍
When Oversimplified taught me more history than all history classes combined
Never thought I’d see the day he’d upload
As a bri’ish that Is defiantly how our government works
GET YOUR ASS READY QUEBEC WERE COMING FORE YOU!
This whole video was worth it for the final 30 seconds with Biden lol
Did he just start a war with Canada
I think I should buy his snowman
basically the sequel to the bucket war
37:10
7:58 nice reference
My god that ending, the hinges were nowhere to be found
Please talk about The War of 1812. James Madison needs his own video, and isn’t given enough credit.
And once again Canada loses out on all disputed land: San Juan, Washington, Alaskan coastline, Point Roberts, even the Northwest angle.
History is stuffed to the brim with nations invading each other for one reason or another. Why is America the only one that gets flak for doing what the same thing... Even the Native Americans spent their history enslaving, killing, and invading each other. Like a lot.   I really expected a more balanced opinion from the brilliant Mr. Oversimplified.
FINALLY
In the thumbnail why is Britain the sith and America is the jedi America was clearly the evil one
Hey. I would like to see the Chinese Civil war
"being American, he appeared from the tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife"
Could you do the english civil war? Its a really interesting topic but the way they taught in school just makes it seem boring
+
THE USA IS THE MOST ENTILE NATION OUT THERE. And there is nothing in this video or history to just change my mind the world would had been better if Mexico and Latino American became the super power smh.
as a German, i never thought that we were the one whom decide that America would had the island. Great stuff
10:55 the most british thing i’ve seen
So not really oversimplified.
"Steamy McSteam Face"!!!!! BAHAHAHAHAAH  (not often [ever] that I run into a random Boaty McBoat Face reference!)  X-)
I feel so bad for James Douglas
I like the cute plushie!!!!
hey oversimplified can you please make a video on the mexican-american war plz
Stil waiting on the Vietnam war vid
Hey, I was thinking if you could do an oversimplified video on Bismarck? Or any battleships which benefited in the WW?
This is genious man. I love you
Well, it was worth waiting for 6 months for this
Nahhh
Oversimplified I loved this video . I was hoping that you would do a video on The Irish civil war as today is the centenirary of the beginning of the war. It’d be really fun to see a video on this part of history or maybe you could do the Irish’s war of independence. Please get back to me I would love to hear your thoughts.
But also 😐😐😐😐😐😐😶
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤪
I found Harney to be kinda funny...until I read up and found out he beat one of his slave girls to death over a missing set of keys...
Could you do the ireland and England war.
Why was it called "The pig war" if there wasn't a war?
Woke view on history ? Sigh ... overwoklified
These are so entertaining and well written 😂😂 and I'm learning too!
Tbh biden would probably fall asleep before finishing his press conference officially announcing his war with Canada or he would misinterpret the teleprompter and say Cambodia instead of Canada
if America invaded Canada the my Canadian railfan self would get to be able to get a job on union pacific instead of peace and quiet
Hard and confused decision????  Straight line is the answer
My favorite ending of any of your videos! LMAO!
I think Oversimplified just lost it at the end...the canada comments finally got to em.
BEST*ONE*YET!!!  ;-)
contender for one of the stupidest wars of all time?
THE LEGEND IS BACK!!
Kids have no idea how lucky they are to have videos like these. I would’ve LOVED something like this while I was in school.
ITS PRONOUNCED BARKSHERE
Best video yet
That thumbnail is just epic
U-S-eh  Worth the wait.
Can you maybe do a video on the periodic table
do a video about the Eighty Years War
Honestly this channel and your vids still stay the best. Your funny and just amazing keep it up
Couldn’t you make these videos a little more often
Степан Сенькович гей
The ending was nuts!
Some span videos
I literally had to write 2 essays about this yesterday and if i had seen this video beforehand i would have written much better essays
Vietnam war... maybe???    PLS
We'll burn down the white house again
I think oversimplified loves shrek 8:01 By the way the song name is all stars from shrek
@OverSimplified I love you. Thank you for making videos.
Oh no now we have to hear insufferable canadians with a superiority complex
Hes back the History king is back
As a Canadian, I believe its now our time to manifest maple syrup, and annex your stars and stripes. If we need help we can just ask the south to leave again
i still think george’s mole is more important than the future of america
7:57 -Amazing 😂😂
Гамлете переводи!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love your videos. Look for the Pastry War. I think it goes well with your kind of content
I love this channel so much
Oversimplified I love you, but this wasn't your best work. It was unnecessarily long and repetitive. The whole video could have been 12 minutes tops. Also you used to have more subtle awkward jokes. But the jokes in this one was so obvious. Anyway man I love you.
Falsest claim i've ever heard: "Bidden is gonna do anything"  Truest claim i've ever heard: "Canada better watch their backs"
Technoblade:real shit
can you make a video about arb world like umayyad caliphate
This is a masterpiece
Ok
Dont mind me I’m just glad Montreal was mentioned. I’m that desperate.
History russian federation 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
I like it how you were say has a nice car and Great Britain has a really old car
Gourd I love being an Oregonian. We are all so fecking weird.
Perfect ending.  Bravo!
Would love to see the Mexican War! I'm a subscriber, so you have to do it.
Please make a Vietnam war video next!
Great vid and all but..... britain won the war of 1812 2:39
I thought it was TECHNOBLADE
Hearing this man excited and shouting for real at the end made me lose it lol
"...and - who was it who spoke to god?"   I swear I hear one of the people murmuring   "The cat, I hear voices all the time!"  lmao.
Can you make the dog war between Bulgaria and Greece ty im not sure but the year its 1923 around there
Great video but I reject the premise that Manifest Destiny was simply an imperialist doctrine that was “made up” by the Americans. All cultures and people (including the Natives) were fond of conquering and settling new territories and often used their religion to justify the practice. It is simply anti- white propaganda to frame the Americans as the bad guys of the story when in reality they were just repeating the cycle of conquest that had been ongoing for millennia.
I reckon oversimplified should make a Jack the Ripper vido
I need more
DoS here, Biden is coming. He just needs to remember what his name and the fact that it is him who we are refering to.
love how florida looks like americas dong
“Straight line? Straight line.”
General Corn Pop LOL
My suggestion for another video about America: The American-Triplotanian Wars. Most people don't know they existed even though they were almost just as important than the War of Independence.
Awesome vid as aways Oversimplified all of ur vids are both educational and very entertaining. Can ur next vid be about the North African war the US did against pirates, or the war of 1812 or the Indian wars the US did like with crazy horse and general Custer. Thanks have an awesome day dude!
Do the history of Poland please!!!! 🙏😭
That ending was eh, something else
Hands down the best ep you've done!
Oh I live on San Juan Island lol
The pig voiced like Morgan Freeman is the cherry on top
I understand that you are trying to explain the situation with the Native Americans, but comparing white people to rats is not cool. I wanted to enjoy an oversimplified video, but that ruined the video for me.
arabs?
Love nordvpn entrance
ending is amazing
Lol we’d just wait for it to get cold and laugh as y’all struggle
I’m not the most loyal Canadian but I wish you luck with your invasion into a country with bad logistical problems from a country with bad logistical problems. You thought invading Afghanistan was bad lol...
Thanks Oversimplified for making these great videos and thanks Nord VPN for sponsoring him so he can buy stuff like food so that he doesn't starve doing so
Do the Mexican American war next. Then we have an American war time line. Or do the Vietnam war.
RUN, CRASH, Keep it Together by Mat Loseth with
7:40 Omggg IS THAT A NWA REFERENCE.
So Vietnam War next??? Or some more obscure topics? Either way I’m pumped!
F R E E D O M .
😂
And who talks to god? “My neighbors cat” “I hear voices all the time “ I lost it
But being an American he emerged with 4 pistols and a knife 🤣 So on the nose!
This makes me want a bacon cheeseburger from McDonald’s god damn it
See you again in six months 😂
That ending was the scariest thing I've ever seen as a Canadian, and I live in America.
Taking cool washington history and ruining it
love you
finaly
BEWARE, CANADIANS!
Hehe General horny...
Being Americans they pulled out guns
Oversimplified guided me to watching reactions.  Thank you so much!
Im glad to see another video
PLEASE DO INDONESIA INDEPENDENCE
As a Canadian, I am terrified.
When the pig showed up as a mafia boss I almost died laughing 😂🤣🤣
Oh God I am dying 😭 🤣😂
United States: Watch your back Canada. Canada: Biden's the president, not scared. United States: Oh yeah. Nevermind..   Let's go Brandon, Fuck Joe Biden....
😂😂😂👌
Why the Sonic the Hedgehog Shoes?! XD
The great emu war?
Why so political
BEST history class I’ve ever had
Please do War of the Roses next. pleaseeeeeeeee
Aww :c i wanted a war
Most underrated educational channel on this site. 👏  Funny, simple and just entertaining 😆.
Holy fucking shit oversimplified has a brand new video for us
Best video ever 😂
The face Pickett makes at 26:04 looks like it's from a Miyazaki movie
Potato war when
Man I actually felt really bad when he found out the pig died...
In response Britain suggested that ‘Many in America’ should such the hell up! 🤣
instead of mentioning canada mention a country in need like venezuela
3:31 Florida kinda sus
😂😂
This is your best video by far, good job!
Except they didn't beat the British, they paid them off after stalling and the threat of others being involved loomed
The Pig War = The Technoblade War
I fricken love these videos!!😂😂😂
Lyman shot the pig.
Canada would kick Americas ass.  If they cant conquer Afghanistan, if they have lost every single war they have started since ww2 except Grenada, if they are generally the most powerful nation in history on paper and yet the least impressive nation in reality and if they are led by an illegitimate imbecile who makes Harney and Picket look intelligent then.... er... Canada would kick their ass.  End of.
I wish someone will help or fund mr simplified to help him make great videos like this...
Maybe you should do the Thirty years war next?
Please make video on India history.
The Ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maybe Biden is coming, but quebec will still be a pain in the buttocks. We're too proud to give up french and our insults.
29:18
Next do a video on Alexander the Great or maybe Julius Ceaser
0 nukes (lame) 😂😂
Was there a reason the sheep were exactly 37x37?
Great video! However, after watching your previous older videos, I think you should tune down the humor just a bit. The dryer more reserved humor on your older videos definitely hit harder than the more slapstick. Thanks for being amazing!
Such a long video <3
That sweet sweet maple syrup. We are so coming baby.
hahaha
amazing video . btw i think you should do a video about the balkan wars
37:16 Undoubtedly one of the funniest sequences I've ever seen, especially the delivery on "the leadership of our glorious president.. Drake!"
Drake 2024 Jayne VP 2024
Brandon 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Pip pip
Don’t worry Canada it’s not a threat       It’s a promise
American: BÄÄÄÄH British ma: BÄÄÄÄH
@ that ending, if we don't invade, someone else will. 😆
I am in sweden
That might be the start of a new legend - The American Peppa Pig
Wooh
The end is the greatest thing I've seen or heard in my entire life not pointing that I want he US to invade canada or anything
4:10 had me laughing so hard
Plot twist: in 2022 american troops invade canada because of a youtuber´s joke
Dat ending tho... The Emotion The Power The Patriotism Even got a stronk german like me crying (probably)
3:35 Florida sus
4:10 Best "America in a nutshell" I've seen in a long time
Pig War: The Rise of porky : The last pork chop : The Butcher Strikes Back
Baby wake up!!! New oversimplified video
Can you do vietnam next?
Oversimplified can you do a video about rose wars pls 🙏
2:27 That punch was so strong that the Americans just got a bunch more land
hey if we join with canada can it be peacefully?
Can you talk about India
4:11 as an american i can agree this is an accurate representation of the normal american Tuesday
Do the Bible or im gonna do something unholy to you
oversimplified i sense some hidden agenda here-
Canada is already American
I ran out of Sam O Nella videos to watch, and that let me to you, I ran out of videos of you to watch, and didn't really have anything else to watch. Pleasant surprise, glad to see more of your content! ❤️
He hasn’t uplaod day in 3 days,I think he’s dead
You can make a video on bismarck
10:30 ngl kinda feels like that
I thought this would be the great potato war
FINALLLY OVERSIMPLIFICED IS BACK !! AFTER 6 MONTHS ! HIT A LIKE IF You agree?
The end went from 0 to 100 real quick
im canadian
could you try in a future video to do a video on the history or timeline of a country eg. ancient rome, british empire
AMIRCA is crazy Canada is overdramatic Oversimplified is just oversimplifying things
Me and the boys on our way to conquer Canada
Why did was Harney even hired if he was the most idiotic person in the US military?
Advertising was smooth af
4:09 I lost it 😂
the yugoslav wars next?
Spoiler, the ending is haro strait is the border
33:07. Is that Nigel Mansell?
Ayo where's the Vietnam video
Your alive
Went to Google Maps to see something about these islands.. there's businesses and places with ratings, some pictures and a few places where street view is available. It was so strange looking at reviews on an island I never knew existed, let alone was the place that almost pushed USA and Canada to war.
i cant belive they nearly started a war over my friends mom smh
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 I've waited so long
Our lord and savior has cherished with another video once more
Oversimplified really did make a full movie production
If there is something I would want for christmas, it would be a new video by Over Simplified! Thank you!
Is that pig waddles from Gravity Falls?
Ieaoia
"canadian viewer : i love his videos!" *Ending : canadian viewer :*
wait, so pig war isn't the war in donbass
Did the pig's voice turn into Morgan Freeman for a second there?
When Scott busted down the door and the General scream… I died
7:57
Yes!  Yes! Yes!
ATLAST
34:00 -HEY, LIMEY! +What do you want, you yank? -....Come to join us for some 4th of the July fun? +...Sure! *much later* +OI! YANKEE! -What do you want, limey? +Queen Victory is over for her birthday. Care to join us for some good ol' fun? -....Heck yeah!  Pretty wholesome stuff
How would one request a "War of 1812 Oversimplified"?  And also you can screw off with your Manifest Destiny Crap, you Yankee Rebels haven't been able to sell us on your BS yet and it ain't happening anytime soon... you'll have to take my healthcare card from my Cold Dead hands!
At 17:30, you stole an object show bfdi asset like moneter school again.
Please do German Unification next
legendary outro
Ah I love learning about the blood, cruelty, delusion, and entitlement that the U.S. was founded on ^^
9:46 looks like a bad drawn map of a 4 year old but with scandinavia way too big and asia and africa united
As a Canadian I can verify you should subscribe
It’s hard to put into words how much I fucking LOVE these videos. You have a straight connection to my funny bone hahaha
I'd pay for a silly FPS set on San Juan. Just saying.
🤣🤣🤣 one of the best yet ❤️❤️
Hahaha🤣🤣 America: Straight line? British: Straight line.
OMG NEW VIDEO
Cool. Now do Vietnam War
That part when Americans coming in large groups 😂
Dude do a Mussolini oversimplifed
No one: Captions: (explosion)
omfg that last bit got me hard xD
Yeah that's about it. I'm keeping a knife under my pillow from now on.
Bro why did you oversimplify the pig war, you should name your channel oversimplified because you oversimplify everything.
Soon Canada will be ours
The way this guy pronounces "Berkshire" *hurts*
Jibran did you see this
Wow, did things ever take a turn there at the end of the video. As a Canadian, all I can say is, do you really want the white house to be burned down again?
“But the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming. Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running”. ALL STAR. 💫
So good to see a new video of yours. maybe you could do one on the great depression...
Finally you are back🤩
13:28 killed me xDDDD
Thanks for posting... I literally binge watched your all videos in 24 hours
i clicked cause i thaught its about minecraft
HES BACK BABYYYYYYYY
As a Canadian, I for one welcome our new corporate overlords and assure them that I can be quite useful with rounding up insubordinates.
Ottoman empire now please
Make a video about Lithuania and Poland
You really have this formula. This was a great episode.
bro are you ''borrowing'' assets? This video looks weirdly out of style
Loved the ending
As a palestinian, i think it's fortunate that no modern examples of a group of people claiming divine right to land that's already inhabited doesn't exist.
I was laughing out loud like maniac at that ending .🤣🤣🤣🤣
The War of Jenkin's Ear might be an equally small event that escalated quickly. I mean it really got out of hand fast. I am sad I can only give this video one like.
He has returned
I like the star wars looking thumbnail.
Oh, so this is life after Hamilton. Lin Manuel should write a musical on this. But until then, I have you to educate me on things i've never heard at.
your videos get worse every time dude did you lose your mojo?
Hey, thanks for talking more about Canada! =D Your videos are always both hilarious and informative to watch. Big fan of your channel! It was awesome to see some history covered near my home Province. That said. You'll never get your dirty hands on our Maple Syrup you Yank!! >;P
Did Oversimplified just declare war on Canada?? Lmaooo
I bet J.J. McCullough will be Canadas Quisling during the coming US occupation.
HELLO FELLOW GUY  MAKE vid on 1971 BANGLADESH LIBERATION WAR!
One of History’s greatest “Wow that escalated quickly” moments
yes now i can have a  plushy  yay i will buy it as fast as can!
Can you do Syrian civilar war?
Finally bro it's been 6 months!
Joe Biden starting a war with Canada will be the dumbest thing he could do in his presidency that might actually happen & it will be the biggest embarrassment of his presidency even if he wins.
Because the British redrew the borders for the straight line shouldn't they get to decide
Return of the king
I love the scene where he sings all star.
Time to binge Oversimplified now
"No the swine is the one I killed, I'm Lyman!"  Literally every dad joke in existence.
phewww
I really hope that last bit isn't clairvoyant. I have friends in Canada and I don't want them to get angry at me because of my country...
3:36 UMMMMMM WHAT IS SHOWING
7:14 Why did i catch that
That ending 🤣🤣🤣👏👏
He should make a video about the greek revolusion
3:33 America gets pretty hard
Was not expecting that ending XD
"Hey man i just kill your pig"
Yayayyayayay new oversimplified
That ending was...yeah, why don't we just invade cana- oh, right, because ALLIES EXIST
The funny thing is that a U.S. investment firm bought the Hudson Bay Company in 2006 making it an American company.
So wait who was in paris 🤔
The ending of this video was EASILY one of the FUNNIEST things one the entire internet! 👏👏👏
Those brits are nerds, they didn’t even try stopping the Americans from invading them twice in this video
Plz! A latin america and Brazil independence episode!
Can you make Vietnam war please.
Canada has had it too good for too long let’s invade! 😎
Why not invade Canada?
Classic Britain with its island disputes. Gotta love the Brit’s
The whole video was fantastic.... until it got to the end. And I aint even from that continent xD
U're best video!!!!!!!
Lol USA would lose as it would trigger WWIII great video Biden can suck it!!!
THE LEGAND IS BACK
i luv ur vids  so i was asking can please make a vid of indian rebelion in 1856
He really planning the destruction of Canada.
Top quality.
Can i also see your mole georgee
Bruh that sheep conversation 👌🏾😂😂😂
That was one of the best videos, such a simple war made in such a great video
everytime i wonder when this dudes gonna upload he uploads
The outro is epic
Do the Sengoku Jidai sometime. :v
AFTER A LONG GAPPY GAP, NICE TO MEET YOU ALL
All respect to Canadians ✊
I have no idea where he got the memo about the plan to annex Canada, Mexico, and Greenland...but yeah it's like a 100 year plan to stop Russia and China from doing the same thing. Stephen Colbert told me so through cryptic messages from his show. The Rock will be the president to start it with a war in Mexico by 2026 over refusal to sell his tequila, followed by Dr. Oz rising to power as designated survivor as surgeon general after a botched batch of maple syrup poisoning the government on national pancake day thus going to war with Canada and diabetes. Greenland calls the US out on there BS in the year 2049 and POTUS Simplified History tells them to back off...whilst slamming the desk right next to "the button".
Of all the videos, THIS was the funniest.
Biden is so inept he’s probably figure out a way to lose a war with Canada
Thanks for at least admitting all our stuff would become your best stuff if you invaded us. 😊
OverSimplified  should make a tic tok account just saying
oh no oversimplified is going crazy. canada watch your back.
did he just photoshop wattles for the pig and made it grey
This video give me bad luck
This video was so good. Fun. Vietnam war next pls
we need more videos 😭
Another racist historian
You should do the Toledo War!
When you have to wait another 6 months after you finished watching the video for the new one
As an American, I'm 1000% OK with the portrayal of Americans in this video.
What kind of moron views a masterpiece like this and doesn't like the video? Dude.....uncool
not going to lie i think we would not annex Canada but ask if they wanted to create a new government with use Let be honest are both governments have a lot of problems but we can certainly learn a thing or two from our norther neibores
The moment you realize the Pickett here is THAT Pickett.
I am the only one who tought that Cody from AltHub would've make and entrance when the ''What If...?'' question was made? Like a ''I'm taking over from here ''
When i heard the voice of Morgan Freeman as the pig, my thought exactly to Charlie Hopkinson, shout out for him!
I love how pikott looks like forgotten weapons🤣
This oversimolified youtuber is getting crazier overtime
Hes back
Hey, can you make about Vietnam war. I'm very curious what you going to say about it.
I'd be totally up for invading Canada, but...isn't Trevor from GTAV Canadian?  Fuck that shit.  That dude is worth at least five Florida Men.
Will you do the Mexican war against America?
Finally, after so many days of waiting.
Since oversimplified already did the bucket war and the pig war....can he do the "pastry war" next????? PLEASEEEEE😁
Finally, I always click on these immediately
Finally a new vid!
I love you bro your a legend
Why you don't toke about iraq
29:06 had my laughing
Sounds like British Canadians needed some guns
How much time do you have to sponsor that dumb website.
1. Greco-Bulgarian war over dog incoming 2. Such "unsupported" actions of territorial expansion, that are claimed unwanted and just a matter of some millitarry commander are common in these years. Look at example of Algeria, etc african colonisation, or french conquest of their indochina. It was the same,just the war broke out. So Harley was nothing special.
Okayyyy... who let Oversimplified get at the bathsalts at the end there!?!
Could you do an episode on the residential schools please?
5:48 wait... I know where this is going... NORDVPN
I would love for my favorite educational youtuber to do a history of Philippines 😂
Every day, we drift closer to just living in the setting of Fallout
-ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS! I HATE YOU I ALWAYS HATE YOU!!!
ive been waiting for you to post
The ending was by far my favorite part.
Also I learned the westward expansion at school a month ago  Edit: ok either something happened or that it’s a really long animation
18:38 Should have said "That'll do Piggly, that'll do"
Better watch out canada
The freaking plushie was the last thing I could ever expect.
I bet that the “straight line” line will be a new meme
Is no one gonna mention the smash mouth reference?
If you want to learn History, subscribe to Oversimplified and boom!
Ayeee my cabin is in lake of the woods
where is norway  :,(
That ending tho
But what about greenland which is actually iceland
yes... finally someone said it... invade canada!!!!!
I like to think that a canada us war would end in a similar fashion as attempts to invade russia
🐖
That Canadian had balls roasting Benjamin Franklin.
Watch out Candians, Bidens coming. And this time he's coming with revenge.
VN war
Wow, im depressed
The ending makes a Chinese citizen like me scared and I’m halfway across the globe
I LAUGHED SO HARS AT THE END XD
Yo the fact that I didn’t know the Oregon trail was bc a petty race to occupy the beaver trade
Where were you?!
now do the great watermelon war (it's real)
So you have make transition from history to movies, especially my favourite series.... Great!
you are goated
33:29 As someone who's dealt with an insufferable idiot for years I feel this man's rage.
Best. One. Yet. Hands down. Well done sir.
The animations and scripts get better and better every video
Hey man, love your vids. Could you please do a video or two of something like the South African frontier war or the boarder war(Rhodesian war), since I am South African. Thanks, and enjoy your day.
Stroking my ego at the end there as an American. It brought out my evil laugh as I cleaned my 1911.
wait where is technoblade ?
So this is why mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
This is a very good video! It is, however, unfortunate to see Oversimplified endorse the critical race perspective of history, which is the idea that the primary motivating factor of American aggression towards native Americans was primarily a factor related to race. Although there was a lot of racism that went into justifying the position of Americans at the time, imperial tendencies would have driven Americans to attack and kill anyone who was between them and the goals of Manifest Destiny. This video clearly shows white people attacking white people for the primary motivators behind almost all of history: money and power. Perhaps fittingly to the name, Oversimplified’s endorsement of the critical race perspective actually is a massive oversimplification that turns history from the complex study of human interaction, nations and civilizations to a crude, elementary level perspective of “white man bad.” White man was bad to Native Americans, but racism is hardly a primary motivating factor and rather a convenient secondary excuse for expanding the American influence and economy.
Very entertaining video my dear sir, great job.
啥时候讲讲中国抗日战争或者内战呗
Wow... This whole video has only further reinforced that the second amendment was the single greatest mistake in American history. I'm so sorry Canada
Me signing up to invade Canada! Let's gooo!!
3:34 ahh, florida great PP of USA
I love how he shows a picture of lake moraine when he mentions banff
The dude putting McDonald’s down had me dead bro
The ending, just *muachhhh*
The way you go to advertising is so epic I love it!
Can we give Winfield Scott some credit? Dude was a complete badass in this situation
*PigWar exists*   Technoblade:did someone say anarchy?
He said “Canada also claimed that territory” after calling America Imperialists in the same sentence so… wouldn’t that mean Canada is also imperialist? No it can’t be the people who murdered native children at churches couldn’t possible be evil imperialists
The return of the king
So the pig was a sith lord?
Russian nuclear history would be funny
That was fantastic
you had to use the pedo at the end.
Grifin's pig is killed  Grifin : Sound the trumpet, final crusade has begun.
Cool bro
Canadians laughing at the opening while walking by murdered Canadian native children’s graves on their morning walk to get coffee is the funniest shit I’ve ever heard
Oh by Jingo
Hey man, I think you may have lost your mind. Can't wait for the next video  Edit: wrote this before the declaration of war so I need to amend my statement to say you've definitely lost your mind
Canada burned down the white house
Isnt it crazy that the us could have looked so much different?

Canada is good country
This channel is perfect to sell NFT’s
The wait is worth it.
7:57 best 5 seconds of the whole video, all star references are the best references.

manifest destiny? you mean lebensraum?
when will the baltic war be drawned? :troll:
Video = good
QAZAQ
You start by saying they won't go west if the people are "White" but proceed to explain how they attacked each other 🤦‍♂️  Race played zero role, power played the only role. And the peace they made with Canada was because of mutual power and mutual fear. NOT because of mutual race.   Adding your racist woke propaganda into a historical video makes it historically inaccurate. Sad because you're very talented.
Why do i feel this is where AoT author found his inspiration for his story If u know what i mean
YESSS, he's back! Love you and your videos, dude <3
I am so happy to see a new video!
Man, your videos keep getting better, best channel on youtube. Can you do something about ancient Rome or Greece please! hugs from Chile!
Was worth the six months for sure
This has been out for 2 days and I’ve watched it Atleast 5 times
Bêlôq
27:27 I saw the difference xD
This video was really great n all, but there was actually no war, conflict or revolution to talk about.
Sorry for being late
Ayo friendly reminder the Canada ain't never lost a war, eh?
Years later Kid- Granps, what led to the fall of the two greatest nations of 2022? AKA USA and Canada! Grandpa:- Here kiddo! watch from 37:08 of this video!
“I hear voices all the time” the guy that got permission from god
American's must really love pigs huh,  100 years later after Civil war, Invasion of bay of Pigs happens, uh oh😅
Please keep making videos i have severe  depression and i need those
New sub. The best history channel ive ever seen
🇦🇿
Thank god you are alive
Heard about this first on the dollop podcast. Still funny
Masterpiece  Pure masterpiece❤️
But... isn’t Drake actually Canadian? So.... conflicting interest?
America wanted to expand: *Grows Florida*
Canada already burned your goofy White House down once. We're happy to do it again.
I hit the like button before I got past the ad. Love these videos
Back to the real history teacher we all love
The moment when you realize that Oversimplified's longest video is about the death of a pig.
What about oversimplified Vietnam war? I've  been waiting
Oh yes the poor natives who had their own genocidal and imperialist tendencies were such poor victims. One sided history hit pieces are atrocious
Oversimplified is the definition of Quality over Quantity, literally.
ZAMN
This is probably your best video ever! Amazing!
4:10 had me dying!
The history of these events remind me how greedy humans are
I bust cus theres a new over simplified
Yay new video!
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
this is 13 trending in finland
Not this is beautiful history
man gave up drawing ppl and just straight up using cut out faces and sticking to the bodies lol
🪲
Q
Whoever started a new YouTube channel recently I wish you a good luck and one day u will become successful. Never give up (Me too).  Everybody starts there count from 1. We all are 1 so we can and we do🥳🥳.
Greece is perfect
Canadians: This oversimplified guy isn't even taking us seriously  Oversimplified: And I took that personally
Oversimplified make a video about space race
yo best history channel
I like  this  video
3:55 I can CLEARLY heard "I hear voices all the time," and I had to pause the video for 5 minutes because I was laughing too hard to pay attention.  Dude.  Your voice is probably the best I've heard on the internet.
Another amazing video!
You lost me at President Drake.
Tis been trending in Ph 🤠 it's a very funny vid
4.1 million views in 2 days, Jesus Christ....
I love it when you upload
Wish I had these type of presentations in school when I was growing up 😂
37:32 yooo what teeee
The Ad LOL
his vids literally never miss
"They took the flag pole." How British
how is it possible i noticed this video only now lol
"Biden coming baby" the greatest line ever uttered.
Absolutely love your videos, wish we got them more regularly but I understand how much effort goes into making these.....so I'll wait patiently! Thank you for such great content!!!
The real war will kick off in this comment section
Oversimplified for president 2024!
Dislike 👎
Took you so long, like half a year, to post a flipping video, but anyways I still will stay subscribed
You want a Woppa?
Pig War sounds like a good name for the sequel to Squid Game
Make more pla
OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED AAAAAAHHHH
Do a Video about vietnam
I would agree let's invade Canada
Did general Weinfeild Scott actually beat harney?
If the USA declared war on Canada, I'm pretty sure the democracy export champions will lose. Why? Because everyone hates USA, just a little; but no one hates Canada. So there you go. The world vs USA is like all of the superheroes in the universe vs Thanos.
please do the French and Indian war next plz
33:26 lmfao sad harney
The ending got me then I remembered...Canadiens are fuckin scary when it comes to war
16:11 I laughed so hard
3:40 Comparing Settlers to rats and disease is pure hate speech, if this channel were pushing any other narrative with this language he would have been 100% deplatformed off the entire internet years ago.
29:17 might be the best oversimplified one liner ever! 😂
14:30
I feel like you’re the only YouTube who can crank 4M views in 2 days. Holy
Hahaha good joke American but I'll have you know that Canada is going to be part of Britain's CANZUK Union...LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!!!
As a British man the end of the video had me laughing my arse off, I think it is your manifest destiny. Take Canada, why the fuck not?
When Ireland and Hawaii link up no ones safe
lack of potatoes
Best Youtube channel ever, as usual. thank for all your videos!. And please take a look onto the triple alliance war when Paraguay declared war to Argentia+Brazil+Uruguay. It was the most brutal war on latin america!
my man wants to invade Canada what a chad
yes i know now that america is stupid just cuz of ONE PIG OK OK
me: sees the title; expects to be about the war about the austro-hungarian embargo video: is about an american war expectations: not met.
this is literally legit lit and superbly accurate !!!!!!!
John Wick had the same story, but its a pig instead of a dog
See ya in 6 months
DAMN I MISS YOU🎉🎉
16:01 Does anyone notice that it's AK-47?
Aren’t we gonna talk about that the REAL WikiaColors commented in this video? I’m his fan!
14:30 the calculator says boobies
7:58 Reference : *100*
2 days ago, I’m late.  How dare I. Now Oversimplified is going to punish me severely…
WAIT... i didnt know there was a Hitler Oversimpliefied Video that is Not available in my country
Should I flag this video as violent content because OverSimplified is threatening to invade Canada?
Another day of waiting for Hussite wars
Do the irak war in video
i liked the Three Kingdoms oversimplified, could u do one on the Warring States period and the rise of Qin Dynasty?
I love your content but the white people comment was kind of ridiculous...
04:10 is when i already lost it. F*cking brilliant.
General Harney, US Army's finest :)
I hope next would be the Roman empire or Julius Caesar
Still waiting for the Vietnam Video that you said you would work on .-.
jst watched 4 minutes and it's already Frickin... Awesome..!!!
What is the name of the band song plays when the Americans are coming ?
That ending was more American, than America itself
Europeans deciding Africa’s borders: 1:54
0:35 oh man, this one caught me off guard XD
Hes back…
I love this
Hmmm. I'm going to give this video a like under the pretense it won't appear in a textbook about the history of the American-Canadian Maple Syrup wars.
Left wing nonsense
A new over simplified video?!?! Finally  my depression will be cured
i thought oversimplified is ded cuz he didn't upload for so long
That was one hell of an ending
Lets agree the outro was better than the whole video😂
Lmao mexico was huge and tinny Canada and USA too small 🤏
To my canadian friends, we would like to combine territories but it will not be an invasion. Just a few troops and a nuke or 2
The amount of work and detail that goes into these vidoes is astonishing.
im 5th grade
5:10 That wouldn't be a surprise anymore 15:50 America greed again -_-
Goat war 🐐
Porky :(
18:47 "Lyman shot the pig" I love how you can hear this grit in his voice that makes it seem so much more impactful.
General Harney more like general hernia
Hahahahahaha so funny 😂
I will never skip one of your YouTube ads
If 2 countries (almost) got into war because of a dead pig, and the world got into war because of dead person (WW1). Then who would Mars and Jupiter join if Belgium killed a God, let's say Allah?
The last part is historically accurate to my civ 5 world somehow
Pog pog pog pig
Yes! I feel so represented as a Washingtonian! We do have history!
Before I watched this video I was filipino, after I finished the ending, I am now American
Im canadian
Biggest OverSimplified moment: Liking the video before it even startet
Next is greenland xD
Omg the end was perfect but I would never want to impose on Canada, I liked the moment when we just enjoyed each other
If you're  canadian  you know  about  the  Hudsons bay company
The pig in the thumbnail reminds me of the Angry Birds star wars series
Incredible! Love this channel
-Straight like? -Straight like.
Hahaha, thats all ill say.
6 months… 6 months… I expect this too be very good
Soooo that’s why the president’s office has those big gold curtains. Makes sense now.
Time to annex Canada boys
God sure loves to mandate genocides.
Hey @oversimplified George Pickett is a grand father of mine, i only knew about his civil war involvement. Thank you for sharing this story. I love learning my family's ( limited) history!
Loved the video. Now we have to wait half a year for another one
I also just realized that Douglas has too much feature... reusing assets for future videos???
Canadians : people don't mention Canada Me who lives in Syria : Amatures
You know how smug someone is when they pull out two big iron and shout and I quote YEEE and I can't stress this enough YAAA
The end is just too good
7:58 ALL STAR BOI
Who talked to god I thought it was sharons cat
Oversimplified makes it sound like the British and Americans had the enemies to inseparable besties moment
17.56
36:56 and 34 British Sheeps.
It was nice to see local history on the channel.  Of course, spoilers, already knew we got the islands but it was a good retelling!
So Oversimplified is now a BTS fan? He's about to gain a ton more followers.
Please do the Boer war
Great video
the ourtro is hilarious
Straight line?
Lol Canada can have Canada.
Anime vibes 37:28
this was a pretty pig war
when my mom sees I have a bad score at math: 33:29
This video remainds me why i love maps
"No Bad Lattitude" hehe
Finally another video it feels like years
Nordvpn ad was smooooth
Is this Technoblade???? Lel
Good to see you
i thought this is just normal name for a map in red alert 2 skirmish but i never thought it has a historical reference
NO stop
That final speech would have almost been worrying... if Trump had won the election
i was expecting a video about Ukraine by that title
sir please upload more about this concept it is really fun to watch
... This was referenced in Rocky & Bullwinkle, with the US and Canada fighting over an island in the Great Lakes that neither side wanted
Oddly specific about mentioning Insulin at the end there, cant help but wonder if he or someone close to him is Diabetic
sounds like neatmike at 18:35 wtf
Wow Oversimplified really ‘hammed’ this one up.
Canada, Noooooooo!!!
I like how oversimplified is cranking these videos like Canada is cranking out as many defenses possible. Or like USA is cranking out more nukes to "attack" Canada
Gotta give credit, improving your voice acting to level up the entire video is great. You must've practiced voice acting over the months or something, I love it.
Your videos are so good noone is even talking about how you got freaking Morgan Freeman to make a voice-over at 31:02!!!
fact: 4.1m people who watched this didnt know what the pig war was
do mongolian empire or afrrican slavery empire
Do canadian revolution next
@12:10 Wait… Did Charles Griffin actually like that pig or was that a joke?
Get this #1 trending in u.s now
bro. don't fight over technoblade
That is a very cute pig
I almost prematurely closed the video when I thought it was over. God am I glad I didn't do that.
Oversimplified has gotten popular enough he can threaten an entire country on behalf of another.   I'm okay with this.
I love the "All star" part
Love how Amercian the Amercian r...
Could the USA invade Canada? This is not a question, this is a request.
Do the chinese revolution plz
I fucking love these videos. God I wish there were more
finaly thanks
LEGENDARY
I laughed so hard at the last part... 🤣 😂
Love oversimplied vedios combo of humour∆ knowledge in one place Love you brother 💞
30:39 has to be one the funniest things I have ever seen great job oversimplified
Finally! A new video 😊😊😊👏👏👏
waddles be like
Was waiting for this for 5 years
i missed you oversimplified
Interesting and funny.   Can you do a video about the problems that Mexico and USA have had over the years?
Well that took a turn in the end
This is an amazing example of the sort of "American Exceptionalism" which thoroughly turns me off of American History. We go into a situation we have no business involving ourselves in... we instigate conflict, the other superpower is like "hey, we should like actually not skip certain steps here... there is a general code of conduct"... we're like "nah fam we're just going to resolve this without governmental interference" and then it eventually escalates to points in which war is going to happen. It doesn't... mostly because of the other force being more sensible... and then we neg our way to a prolonged passive aggressive victory that no one really cared about anymore because its petty at absolutely best in the first place.   Do Hawaii next. That'll be a real tearjerker to show off how gross our wealthiest most religious citizenry can be.
if USA invaded canada than this may trigger world war 3 cuz you canada has alot of Allies and america could not stand a chance against the united nations
You are the best youtuber to ever exist, i love your channel, the quality of the videos, the humor, e.t.c. By the way could you make a video about the great northern war?
Shout out to Hey Arnold for making a pseudo episode about this that's the first time i learned something about the pig war. 90s kids assemble!
because Biden is coming baby and he is coming this time with avengerssssssssssssssss
1:22 That one there was a violation personally I wouldn't have it.
why did youtube unsubscribe me??? I was late 2 days bc of this :(
"well, that is a perfectly fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties, AND THERE IS NO WAY IM GOING TO AGREE TO IT!" this is your best line yet
what this
Just proves Americans just take what they want
That has to be the most accurate representation of the British Parliament I've seen.
Oh God. Are we gonna have to talk about California now?
7:57 hahahaha... Smash Mouth
Awesome Video!!!!!!
Americans are now finally realising the odds and moving swiftly into position
the ending was absolutely hilarious
i would love to see how USA would lose to Canada
I didn't look at how long the video was, and when it ended, and I saw it was 38 minutes, it had felt like 20. Stellar entertainment!
Yusuf kayalap mood
Biden's coming?   Looks like the Maple suckers have nothing to worry about then... ;)
this is the most furious video I've ever seen on this channel
immer wieder geil
What a boring episode. This was by far the worst episode
Wtf ending man
RIP Pig
No please Biden, dont infest Canada. Everyone loves it
Its me from the fututre i will grant your wish not to see my previous cringe comment
Well done!
Holy shits, the animation improvement went through the fucking roof on this video, like damn it really smooth to watch the video
@03:38 GEORGE MCFLY!!!
That ending! Always a great surprise to see one of your vids come out!
15:15
3:37 destiny has a spelling error
What is the song that was being played in the background whenever Americans show up?
could you do a Romanian video?
My Favourite moments: 16:27 - "Why do I hear songs of liberty?" 27:25 - Subtle but hilarious joke once you think about it. 36:56 -  38:20 " *Manifest Destiny Returns* "
You have no idea how much I enjoy your videos!
In the next video you can do the italian Resurgence?
Hey Oversimplified? Everything OK over there bud?
Not even during the height of the online maelstrom around the 2020 election has anyone ever gotten anywhere close to being as fired up about Biden as that feckin ending, lol.
The Panama Canal didnt exist yet tho lol
Oh American Fourth of JulyCool super cool
I requested this one from Puppet History so many times. With the Professor trapped in the primordial past, OverSimplified is the next best thing. Maybe next he can cover one of the other funny history stories I like, such as Wilhelm Voigt, the con man who tricked the Prussian military into helping him rob a town blind, or Mr. 880, the world's nicest counterfeiter.
Here is your daily reminder to drink water and to eat a meal. Take care of yourself because you do make the world a better place 💚
how about you make a video about jack the ripper
This video ending was peeerfect
casual racism at the start
Now you have said Canada in your video, how about Singapore 🇸🇬
Talk about iraq
I waited for nearly 3 months to watch one of this and it always worth .
The ending was awesome...great Job
Dude! Finally
Holy shit you’re back
God I like your videos
7:57 nice rhymes
Where is my Vietnam war? I have been waiting for it for 2 years now
so thats why technoblade used a pig skin
The Americans and British get a little…eager for beaver.
Oh no...
i though it was Hog Of War
The last time I watched one of your video's was around a year ago. To much bloat in these new ones.
When the world needed him most, he returned
Okay the way you drew general harney looks like grandpa not they way he looked irl but the way you drew him...noice
Yellowstone is just one of many American NPs much more awesome than Banff.
I'm so glad that I live in Australia and that America is too self absorbed to care
Finally
You should make a video about the Israeli pig war, which i am taking an active part here
‘Its my Density’ had me in creases
Where NAM
37:46 Hold up, why would you use the Egyptian Eagle on the US flagpole, are you implying that the Egyptian Empire is the one who's pulling the strings of America and Canada all that time?!
Was it really necessary to use the word like "rats" or "virus" about humans? Conquests and invasions have happened before.
Is he gonna cover the vietnam war next? I think the Vietnam war and russian invasion into afghanistan would be very interesting topics
That ending is so patriotic and radiates so much freedom my entire water supply turned into oil—    Wait a second—oh shi—
Ayo Victoria finally mentioned in something
Lol the day pikkets charge happened is my birthday
can your next video be about alexander hamilton?
v
Dude, its 2021, you gota stop using those old memes, change with the times dude, its cringe
7:56 bruh I started laughing soooooo much
Oh man whenever he said DC I was hyped (I'm DC fan XD)
Man these vids get better and better amazing work keep up the good work
That ending was priceless XD
Finally! The most EPIC comeback!!!
Come at us america. We beat you in 1812, we'll do it again.
liking even before watching, coz it is going to be lit..
That ending made my day
It doesn't matter how intelligent you are. If you are influential, and your friends are too, and you know how to put on a puppy face, you'll get what you want.
american presidents are kinda running the country like playing eu4 lmao
Where the hell have you been? Missed you so much
Plz do the Vietnam war
Haha I live in whatcom county
More more more more more more more more more more more more more more
THE HUMOUR IS SO GREAT
So... Does he not like Canada?
Because Biden is coming baby
well with such a cute pig...
BRITAN DESERVED TO CLAIM THAT ISLAND
I live on Orcas Island, one of those islands.
Canda byby
Honestly a bit underwhelming, jokes are funny but they are dragged too long and that makes them annoying
A hundread years from now "USA - Canadian OverSimplified War - OverSimplified"
5:53 2 more letters.
Cmon let's invade canada it's our manifest destiny. Let's save them from affordable insulin. And get all that territory for us !!! Go biden launch the troops it will a breeze.😂😂😂😂
Some people are idiots and some folks are fine 🤔32:30
Yee yee baby
Finally
They don't even try anymore.
“I hear voices all the time” lol
I could see Trump attacking Canada not Biden. Sorry but Biden can barely remember where he is half the time
That ending
He finally posted
The legend is back, Woohoo!
Ah these transitions from history to sponsor advertisers. Makes me both laugh and swear like a russian that stubbed his toe
Bold of you to assume your military stands a chance against our self propelled polar bear rockets, our igloo bunkers, and polite demeanor :)
Hey oversimplified can you please do Philippine-American war please.
This was so funny and interesting 🤣🤣
the time canada burn the white house was not enough ehh
Ahh the irony of the US - carping on about freedom and independence from the shackles of an imperialist power...and then immediately wanted to be one.
Ah well more very good videos:)
Incredible video, I love this channel. I love how he has general understandings of global geopolitics but shows it in a subtle ways :D
Lol bet invade canada I can't wait to to lower that population number
He's coming for canada😁🤣
Bidens coming for are kids maybe
33:29 Someone: How many times you watched this? Me: ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH
I love how he makes a joke about how they would’ve given the land to the Indians if they were white then cut to let’s invade Canada
6:53 to skip the second commercial. We go to YT to skip the commercials  now the commercials are in YT
6 months til a new video isn’t that long
ahh that was good, well see ya in 6 months
There's gotta be a movie about that island
All Hail Plankton
I believe it is more efficient to teach history in school with this video
General Horny and Captain Horny
Don't worry Canada, Biden can't even spell his own name.
Why is it always the tiniest specks of land that inevitably cause the biggest headaches for people? 😟
Please do the war of 1812!
BEST. CHANNEL. ON. YOUTUBE
That ending couldn't have got any better
But less violent maby Biden could buy it
14:33 made me choke  GO SUCK AN EGG🤣   \
38:43 I think that would be cool
You should make a video about the dutch rampjaar (1672)
25:54 OH CRAP JEFF WE’RE ABOUT TO BE BLOWN TO BITS
Pogg
“The Americans kept coming and they didn’t stop coming, they hoped in their wagons and hit the ground running” I need a whole album of this type of rhymes😤

That transition into the ad was smooth AF 👌🏼 👏🏽 😎
The big comeback
Next video suggestion:- India's Great Kargil war 1999.( Or any other war between India and Pakistan, or China )
When The Pig suddenly turn himself into Morgan Freeman...
This was beautiful
Dude I live in Banff.
*manifest destiny intensifies*
14:29 haha funni number

8:00 thought you would sneak in all star 🤣
Next vid should be the Vietnam War.
Man this channel is so good. Already wanting the next episode 😂
“But, being an American, he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife”
You can release that Vietnam war
Let's go, Round 8

Thank you for covering this bit of Washington State History.
Finally!!!!
Oversimplified has clearly become Overcomplicated
38:19 calm down there oversimplified
Well this was going fine, with some good jokes at America's expense but they keep coming and it's starting to just seem like throwing shade for the sake of throwing shade...
I didn't like the end I'm British tho
That freaking pig scene is actually hilarious
👏👏👏👏👏
Breaking News: US Troops Invade Canada General Milley: “I don’t know, the President said he was instead by some online media.”
Am I the only one who hears at 7:55 an All star reference?
Me when we lose in COD 32:30
Ok one I bought the plushie and two the ending was amazing 🤩
where y’all been??
Time to set the clock, another 6 months for a new video from oversimplified
Love from India
USA USA USA
He could drop "Vietnam War Oversimplified" any day now
This feud that almost lead to a international conflict several times, gives me the energy of the two tribes from “The Great Divide” episode of ATLA
As a Canadian I say come on in... after your next election that is ;)
How to get what you want: Be spoiled
I don't think anyone was ready for that ending on their first view
yay new video
37:18 the greatest rant in history
Ending lol,Lets start war in North America
Props to you, I live next to the islands and the map you drew is spot on
Is it me or does all of you notice that his content are getting more and more entertaining and better
The amount of work and detail that goes into these vidoes is astonishing.
Ayo Vietnam when? lol jk
"BIDEN IS COMING BABY!!!!"
Yo it’s so weird seeing this video because in the video I can see where I live in it, right next to Victoria and Vancouver island
Solving rubiks cubes oversimplified
And then they pull their guns on them🤣😂
The real Pig War involved a flock of furious fowls that you might just recognize.
The 6 month wait are worth it
Finally another video
We're still waiting on vietnam war, or there is a tax for that?
you mean the technoblade war
When are you going to do the Vietnam war?
I was thinking when OverSimplified will post a video again, and the next morning, I saw this.
NEW VIDEO
NEW VIDEO
He has returned
You fool! Your numbers and vengeance mean nothing to the Royal Canadian Bear Calvary! Your tanks will fall to our majestic Polar Bear steeds!
That, uh... that took a turn
It wasn't a draw Canada kicked America's ass idc
30:33 This is the state of world media even today, divided into left & right. They victimize their own and villainize the other. No one, absolutely no one knows the source or the truth. It's all one big Manifukfest Destiny 🌈
Why not an Oversimplified body pillow?
Biden can’t even keep this country together much less add a massive socialist country to the US he can’t even go down 5 steps 😂
i am big dog, and this is a good video
Those idoitas. Man, I really love your narration and presentation.  You are truly a top-tier SSR ultra anime waifu.
This might be my favorite one!!!!!!!
Finally new video out
37:12 If there’s no more history for Oversimplified to oversimplify, he’ll have to make history for him to oversimplify.
You’re a legend
I really do like America, but a USA take over would be devastating. I much prefer our government and the society we built up here than what is in Amerca. Let's just stay allys....
7:56
Notifications failed me!
HELL YEAAAAHHH!!! Canadaa more like noth-northern America 😂 omg love the video it was amazing!!
General Pickett hide in a barn during Pickett's charge.
Could you please make a video about the 30 years war in Europe?
7:56  Shrek 1 song reference Nice!
Honestly, too much humor for my taste in this one
FINALLY
Biden can’t remember what underwear he’s wearing, how would he invade Canada?
Looking at the state of Canada in 2020... I think they need a little freedom
18:48 Oversimplified out of context
Bro what happened at the end of this
Please make next video on Alexander campaigns
yes finally
Only thing I can say, MOOOREEEEEEE!
what a masterpiece of cinema
16:00 Wait...   The Avtomat Kalashnikova wasn't an American firearm! It wouldn't even be developed until more than a century later in 1947 Soviet Russia by Mikhail Kalashnikov, following the conclusion of the second world war.
Hi
Ur voice changed
My luck is insane, I’m studying abroad in France the year the the Americans finally lose their bananas and invade Canada.
Day of the rake soon
a war over YOUR MO-
Vegan teacher gonna be triggered
Way too many memes. I was hoping for something like Historia Civilis or CGP Grey.
That ending was Awesome bro
I loved the all star parody
How does this man continue to outdo himself in every video
So since you do wacky crazy history subjects (which there is no shortage of history is crazy) but I’d love to see either a Nero or Caligula video in the future I can only imagine what you make of the events and political bs that happened in that time it’s as crazy as it gets.
Bts biiotttt
It’s been so long since I’ve seen these 😭
Finally oversimplified make a video it was 6 months now he make a video
You outdid yourself
Canadians after this video be like: "One eye open when im sleepin', one eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee
33:26 😂😂
Can biden even lead a war though?
Craziest plot twist ever
“The pig war” Technoblade: so am I there?
" But the Americans keep on coming and they don't stop coming,  hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running" Best part of the video
Absolutely Amazing! Handclaps All Around
I just dont know why a pure american shooting a gun that is still not invented and is from the other country
Hes back at it again
Did anyone else notice the positioning of Florida when America was drawn with legs lol?
Okay, but that Back to the Future reference at 3:38.
Bro spelled "destiny" As "density" 😭😭
Please, someone put this man in charge of The History Channel and give him free reign + a bunch of animators. I'd love to actually get people to react with 'Cool, history is so f*ckin awesome!' when I tell them I studied it and that is a sure-fire way. 😂
OverSimplified just keeps getting better and better with every video.   This is one of his best videos for sure.
Can u switch the south’s and north colour for the civil war
Sussy Pig
If only our history classes had been so much fun
The last minute of this video was the most patriotic thing I've seen in a while. Currently preparing for the first orders from general OverSimplified. CANADA WILL BE OURS!
I live next to that middle of nowhere
You know in Europe we had something called plebiscite, so If there was a region like this islands people living there would vote to what country they want to be a part of. But you know war is fine I guess
Surprise appearance by Ian from forgotten weapons
Don’t act like we ain’t fuck you up in the war of 1812
I didn't know that the pig war and the bay of pigs fiasco aren't the same thing...
I missed you 😭
We take Canada then the world. Manifest Destiny
Why ARE British people so negative?
the amount of work that went into this video is astonishing. i have watched every single video you have made oversimplified. keep up the work
Beautiful. Perfect ending.
3:53 "I hear voices all the time" lmfaooo
That ending really made me laugh my ass out
that was good but what the hell was that ending lol
Manifest destiny was really only for the common man, you can’t blame all of American expansion on that one belief
As a Canadian.... I loved this video haha awesome stuff
Bro that ending 😭😭😭😭
o7 to this man
He forgot the part where, the Brits went runnin in the war of 1812.
Nice
2 days over 3millions views  Not even single Dislike click  What a creation video Thumbs up!
OMG a new OverSimplified video! *adds to watch later*
8:44 on the left where the table is located. I think Oversimplified is giving us a hint that Vietnam war is the next vid. Don’t ask how I noticed, I’m usually this observant.
MAKE MORRRREEEEE VIDEEEEEEOOOOOSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
WHERE ARE OUR VIETNAM WAR ?
when oversimplified post you know it a good day
4:00 Literally the best description of how the world sees the US I have ever seen. The mental breakdown at the end was funny though
Thissssssssssssssssssss is total awesome video with great detailed infos
Wait you can't manifest destiny Canada. They're white.
This somehow reminds me of angry birds star wars crossover
Straight line? Straight line. Hotel? Trivago.
30:10 oh of course the idiot is friends with the genocidal maniacs
That last segment was way more patriotic than any ever presidential speech I’ve seen.
Maybe some day this video will be in a video about the great war over a YouTube video about an almost great war over a pig.
I am from Canada 🇨🇦  I unsub
If dis is how they teach us about history ,School would be a cool place
Wtf was that ending?
Beautiful
when you realise some people from history where even more stupid than now, like literally fighting for over a pig.
Nice Ending
This video is disgusting  Glad to see he sold out…. Not funny Dislikes probably outnumber likes….but they won’t show because everyone hates them hahahaha
So this episode’s epilogue is the backstory of Fallout. Ok, Ok… what bad could possibly happen
And here I thought Americans use their guns too much now...
Someone get this man a raise
“you don’t talk about canada enough!!” you guys literally have less population in your entire country than the singular US state of California XDXDXDXDXDXD
It is about time! Let's f&%@ up Canada! 💥
I fell in love with history with oversimplified  I want a Thermopylae Persia vs Greece video
Based ending 🇺🇸
I think he got a little too passionate at the end
20:49 and yet he was goddamn general
yeah finally
An Oversimiplified video on the mughals, the crusades, or the ottomans would be great
Oversimplified dude you are back.😯😲😲
Let's gooo
the morgan freeman piggy caught me off guard
Where’s that Vietnam over simplified or Korean War over simplified or the entire conflict in the Middle East vs the USA over simplified :(
Magellan discover philiphines
Hm. Interesting.
He returned
If you haven't thought about it yet or if no one else has mentioned it, you should do a video(s) over Genghis Khan
technoblade never dies
no
another awesome hilarious video. well worth the wait
4:11 battlefield 2042
Whaaaaaaat
Pure quality!
Can you make video about winter war
27:26 Not gonna lie, it took me a second 😆.
I heard about this incident when i was in high school
your animation is getting better and better
Wake up honey new oversimplified
Random Timestamp 26:09
For the love of God please no don't do this to us
Me watching oversimplified: ☺ Me, hearing "BTS": 😳💜
Yo Oversimplified! Please work on topics of British Raj till Indian independence! Thanks in advance!
That bloody intro. Snuggle ME!
GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!
0:01
Just A Pig  Don't you Understand they are way more important than any humans ever would be
Those islands are the San Juan's and they are gourgus. I went over the summer on a summer camp there and it was very cool.
Today: The BRITISH ARE COMING What actually was the word he said The REGULARS ARE COMING
I have a newfound appreciation for Winfield Scott after this video. I only knew him as the the guy waaaay too old to be in charge of the Union for the Civil War. But he managed to de-escalate this thing about as well as one could hope. This whole affair is basically the Cuban Missile Crisis but dumber.
oversimpilfied: like rats or disease everyone: thinking about corana
hey that griffin dude wasn't an idiot, it wasn't his fault
And I had gotten used to the idea that you had died
God bless America
Yoooo I miss you guys I imagine you doing a video on current history it be sooo funny
Noice
Good work
I live in this area and most of us wish we were Canadian lol
Like all ways Oversimplified never manages to dissapoint, the guy is so funny i laught for a hall video by the way i have some suggections for your next video, i was thinkin you could do the Crusades or the Vietnam war since you metnendt in your Cold war video   By the way sorry for my bad speeling, English is not my first language
why do all the americans have to convince themselves the war of 1812 was a draw, cope seethe cry about it you guys suck at war
hey oversimplified how do you make your awesome videos? like what app do you use and how you animate it?
07:58 we just got all starred
38 mins long… 38th on trending pageXD
The brits didn’t burn the whitehouse! That’s the only thing Canada has going for it, don’t take that from us.
37:37 and every Canadian immediately starts to cringe… hard.
Anyone notice the tourist boat named Steamy McSteamface?
This Canadian/American house is divided on the ending 😂
were the islands gay or european?
I'm a Wasitonian... *HOW HAVE I NOT HEARD OF THIS?!?*
You are loved by God no matter what you think or do trust that always.  Seek him and you’ll find.  He can help anyone out if any situation.  Amen✝️🤟🏻
I like how you "Rack" a Double Barreld Shotgun
Please never stop making videos. :)
fort Vancouver: TRANSFORM!!!!!!!!!!!! *POP* Vancouver: bonjour mes bros!    also I'm so happy for a Canada-related history video!!!
Strong finish
Oui detruisons le Canada s'il vous plaît
7:57 man i love this all star reference
better see everyone buying oversimplified plushies for xmas to support our fav creator
I have been blessed with this vid🥰
The king has returned
WAIT I LIVE THERE
Wow a plushie I would actually buy if I found it at the store
War of 1812!!!
So do we all re watch his videos til he posts again?????
Meanwhile, over in the Appalachian Mountains, we have another war that involved a big. The great Hatfield-McCoy War.
this video was really great. im just wondering if you would every do a video about Poland? coz like, yaknow, we saved Europe from total obliteration like 3 times at this point
I’m Canadian, I took university level history class throughout high school, and some elective ones in University. How the f*ck have I never heard of this story?!
That last bit about Biden made me freaking lose it!!!!
The merch link can't be clicked, had to copy and paste it. Good plushie tho.
Technoblade?
When the world needed him most He returned
I feel like this isn't fair.  The pig didn't get any justice.
You my friend should use NordVPN
Boy that escalated quickly
This video was really funny I enjoyed it very much 😂😂😂 great job
I'm thankful that I live in a time where I can watch this video any time I want, anywhere I want, for free, forever
love the vidoes!! do you think you could do the Gulf war next?
"There is nothing more childish, short-sided, or generally idiotic than international diplomacy." -probably Abraham Lincoln or something idk
Something from my neck of the woods, awesome.
I learned that if you don’t agree to compromises that protect the interests of both parties, you will come out on top.
You don't talk about Australia enough
Winfield is an absolute chad in this war
Awesome vid.  I’m in Seattle, so it’s very cool hearing about history nearby.  And that ending… that glorious ending. 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽💯
James Douglas was black
After half year, finally a new upload
Yes he finally uploaded
Dude you’re amazing. I cannot begin to imagine how much work you put into this. KEEP IT UP BROTHER
The ending had me dying! Oh my goodness! Manifest Destiny to the North! The new frontier!
Oversimplified, a cute little YouTube channel with over 10 subscribers, maybe a cause of the north US war to Canada...
Rimtai?
He's so good that he is literally singing All-Star 7:55
Russian civil war please
Where is pig wa4s men i want to say i geut and people us say wowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowo i like us wowoowowwowoowowowowowowowowowowowo hahaha
Finally!!!
ah yes the best way to end off a video, threatening Canada and saying Biden will do it.
Well worth the wait
Do a video about the Mexican American war
the end tho
Nowadays Oregon is such a shit hole you couldn't give it away.
You sure you can handle the weather up here bud?
The legend has posted again
what a perfect christmas gift
The greatest ending of all time
Do Vlad next
3:34 Florida :O
Biden is coming baby 🤣🤣🤣
Why does Pickett look like Ian mucculum (I know I spelled that wrong)
That Drake reference was god tier💀
😂😂😂
Hey bruuhh Why don't u make a video Or maybe a series bout Indian revolution.... 🦆🦆 BTW love ur videos... 🤣🤣
That Canadian rant at the end really… really moved me to tears.
Bought my plushie as soon as I saw it. No regrets.
i wish biden could do something in afg so that he could have something to do in canada ?! cant even invade a small country lol
I’m a simple man I see oversimplified I click
New video yesssss...
US still has a bit of the Manifest Destiny mentality tho The past indeed defines the present
The end part is the best part of the video
I really hope you cover the war of the roses.
Smash mouth (all star)
Rubbish.
that ending is funny he was soft voice to FULL American
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I reallyyyyyy wish he posted more :(
These videos are always funny, but this one was over the top. Best video to date!
Hey oversimplified I think it would be cool if you make a Texas Revolution video it won't be long since the war wasn't long. It could be a mini war video.
I feel so bad for the pig
Hi im your fan. Could you make a video vietnam war oversimplified? Thanks
Man.......that ending was fire.......
took a dark turn
Something about the Germans, who didn’t even colonize in the Americas, getting to decide who got the islands made me laugh
pig
There was the Emu war and the Soccer war earlier. Now we have the Pig war. What's next? A Chocolate war?
Great one! You could add more comedy and send your viewers rolling down the floor laughing, but anyway it is nice. You could add the history and politics of the rest of the world in your videos too. Waitin' eagerly for the next video.
He's backkkkkkkkkkkk
If I gonna be honest Biden would be the president stupid enough to order an invasion of Canada….. he literally a elderly man that just got lost on his way home
Oversimplified barely talks about new zealand
im all for the annexation of canda. it worked in fallout. whats the worst that could happen.
My class😐 10:22
Most epic ending ever in my life
YEEES MANIFEST DESTINY TAKE NORTH AMERICA
No need to colonize Canada. We need a place that’s chilled with nice people.
Have to wonder why oversimplified is still advertising nordvpn after they've had half a dozen data leaks :/
I mean seriously. Better and better each time. Well done! Don't change!
Well, I can think of a certain country to the north that won't be seeing THIS video.  That is, unless they had the magic of Nord VPN.
Oh, fancy that, an "American" declares their illegal war of aggression in 1812 a "draw"  When an invading force is routed and sent back to their homes, they were DEFEATED. And in fact their own commander admitted that he lost all control over his men, and that he was unable to stop them looting for two whole weeks. So not just defeated, but lawless cowardly pirates to boot.
No no no as a Canadian I’m pissed at the ending
Pls do Yougozlan civil war
Dislike.
OMG THAT ENDING, AS AN CANADIAN THIS TERRIFIES ME
Not sure if it's been suggested already but history of Apartheid would be a pretty cool vid B)
37:07 bruh was not expecting this
16:37 SACRE BLUUUU!!
Is that to much to ask. PRINCESS!!!!🤣🤣🤣
The greatest character development in all this is Oversimplified's voice acting CUS HOLY DANTE'S 9TH LAYER ITS GREAT good job and keep it up
I’m literally crying
Pls upload videos more frequently
RMS Titanic next!
Holy....
hes bakk
Yes I love your videos
You're back love your version of history keep up!!!!😆
A war of a pig and potato,  Ah yes understand mhm, bye
I could not help but to smile at the end 🤣👍       Oh and like and subscribe 🇺🇸❤️
Tha tha that's all folks!
Dislike ↓
Absolutely hilarious
Why did I like the outro so much?
technoblade never dies!!!
Love how the muskets are cocked like shotguns lol
It couldn't have been pzazz and zing that convinced the Germans, they are Germans.      P.S- I kid the Germans, please don't have elections with an angry, little, parkinsons riddled, tiny mustachioed, Austrian man.  Good vid, see you again in 5 to 6 months oversimplified.
The end of the video was Funni
Too bad today's republicans weren't around then. They would have tried their re-districting crap and gotten themselves scalped. Hopefully.
Occasionally, I learn interesting things from oversimplified. After about 10 minutes, when it became clear this is just a "dog America" video, then I was done. Look, America is far from perfect. However, when the context is that America sucks and everyone else is just so great, that's when I'm done. Every country and every civilization has done incredibly sucky things. Yes, including your precious native peoples. EVERYONE is terrible to some extent. It's so stupidly one-sided, it's not even entertaining to watch.
mmmmmm I am craving some baked potatoes and bacon
dude you are literally the best youtuber ever. Were learning manifest destiny in class and you explained it 20 times better then he did
What next the lord of the rings but oversimplified?
THE ENDING
love  how its just 2 incompetent and idiotic leaders at odds like most wars
Plot twist: oversimplified is gonna be the next person to conquer all of America (canada still better)
Thought this was April Fools, checked the date......
7:58-8:06 is an All Star reference
This better be about technoblade
homie lost his got damn mind at the end
do the cultural revolution in china
finally, the wait is all worth it
"What the f-"
That ending was something... LOL
This is extra appreciated after 50 terrible first YouTube dates. lol I subscribed immediately
Tbh if oversimplified got infront of Biden with an "invade Canada" order I am sure Biden in his demented state will sign jt
We can all agree general Harney has an amazing reputation
Dear lord that comment on insulin is too true. Being type 1 diabetic will bankrupt you while also killing you. Great combo. Also great video!
WOOOOO VANCOUVER ISLAND WOOOOOOO YEAHHH BABY DOUGLAS BABYYYY YEAHHH WOOOOOO
Amerika uber alles in der welt
Id love to see you do a video on just the Buchanan presidency also this sounds like the BATTLE OF THE MORONS
On behalf of the Canadian people: lol.
America through out history in a nutshell: guns, insisting land of west of north America, and generally chaotic, and which is why I love America
AMERICA!!!!!
I just learned about some of this stuff in APUSH 💀
That's right, Canadians!  Brandon is coming!  Protect your children.  No, I mean it.....protect your children.  Really.  Especially the little girls.  He's quite fond of them.
Thank god you uploaded a video
Aye he is back
You’re animation has gotten better as this channel goes on
These videos is amazing my brother
Me when oversimplified posts: CMERE BOI
I gotta hand it to Franklin, we gotta get dem cruves
The end was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.
You're welcome for the Islands by the way.
32:37  I can't wait for Oversimplified to use the word Smoothbrain
I hope this guy never stops making videos
When Will Ur New Vid Come? we are waiting for new vid
The National Emblem March slowly getting louder was simply hilarious.
This was amazing! That ending was too good.
the end of this video got me patriotic and bricked up
As a Canadian I am terrified
Oversimplefied most american moment
Bro every year I get my hopes up for oversimplified veitnam just to not get it
To all Darren's we find peasants nothing more than monsters lol
When you go to both camps in person the British camp is set up much better than the American one.
My yee haws about to show, but can you do the texas revolution. That would be nice, a lot of 7th graders in texas would thank you
this video is sponsored by techno blade from the art of war
Good to see this channel is still going strong even after all the time it's been since I was watching them. Great work!
Trying to imply white people don't invade or go to war with other white people is a bit of a stretch. They even go to war in this take on history
36:59 I AM THE WATCHER
Defiantly worth 6 months of waiting 😂
The return of the King!!
I feel like he's just making up history so he can have more content at this point😂😂
The wait is finally over, now we wait again
exceptional!
Canada Rules USA Drools
Canada is basicly the hot step sister who's stuck.
Grew up on those islands, we heard so much about this "war", but nobody else seemed to have heard of it. There's really nice parks on San Juan island where both armies had their camps. It's concerning how close I was to being born a Canadian!
That ending makes Canadians proud to be Americans.
Biden is definitely not invading Canada.
Hate too say it, but the reason I loved oversimplified was the peppering of whit and irony here and there with a couple of ridiculous one liners throughout the video. The whit and irony are now mostly replaced with too much outlandish lowbrow humor for my taste. Just my thoughts, but I prefer the older presentation.
Qrtrq
Biden is actually dumb enough to invade Canada
Great video as always. Will we ever get a more in depth video on the war of 1812
BIDEN’S COMING…………     to take a nap.
god I love America
I dont think bidens gonna do anything Canada don't worry. He can't even run a self sustained economy with out crashing it. Now if some one else got in there with slightly a bit more less deteriorated mind then I'd be concerned..  ... wait...  I get the joke now... its the fact Canada is safe... f.
i don't feel safe in canada
Long wait well worth
WE WANT MORE VIDEOS GRRRRR MAKE MORE VIDEOS
this guy has the smoothest sponsorship transition
The entire time I was thinking, "It can't be the same Pickett, can it?" and IT WAS.
Thank you! Resident of one of the islands (one you can even see in the diagram you use). So neat to see the history of the area get some attention and see some stuff I remember from high school history class.
You should do one about the Vietnam war
The Nord ad made me laugh louder than you wearing my underwear.
Canada has no nukes...but you don't want to learn how many uranium mines they have. No nukes is better described as "no nukes right now."
Boy I straight up though he got Morgan Freeman to voice a damn pig
This puts the over is oversimplified
Lmaooo that last bit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i think that the ending is the loudest ive ever heard oversimplifieds voice get
Thought this was something to due with technoblade lmao
Lol that last part made me laugh so hard
When there is  a walking pig you know the next videos will be awesome
It’s hard to watch a history video so saturated with ideology. But most of it is still good.
you should talk about the viking years in norway
7:57 - 8:05 You should do a history parody of All stars
I think this is one of my favorite videos, but god the last part got me, taking over Canada, holy shit that’s amazing, Biden is coming for your ass 🤣🤣🤣
YAAAAAAY HES BACK!!!
that's waddles from gravity falls
Canadians… with how much Biden has destroyed our economy and how much the Democrats actually hate our military… you are very safe. The most dangerous threat to you is literally the Middle East.
Is that Morgen Freeman part real?!?
omg he uploaded yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I was watching this on public transport, my stomach hurts.
3:50 I thought Joseph smith was about to make a appearance
7:58 made me die of laghter
I was not expecting that ending, holy shit that was hilarious.
Hey Oversimplified! When will the next video come out!
Straight up learning about this rn inclass
The Pig War, eh? Thank your mother for her service for me.
I sent this to my friend who is in Canada and is asking me for a gun inscase we do invade Canada.
Another phenomenal video. Genuinely brilliant channel!
Can't wait for people to look back on this in 2038 when we do invade Canada
The ending 🤣🤣🤣
Please do Philippine-American war. Also I love ur vids man keep em up!
Are these the British Virgin islands? It makes sense?
Being Canadian is the funniest part of this
If America invaded canada NATO would fall apart
7:56 ...so much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking Oregon country
Gotta be honest I think the humor is going a little too far, it’s kinda distracting me from the actual history
Americans 🤦🏽‍♂️
Legendary. Moose meat and donuts for all Americans
no u lmao
*The king has returned*
Rupert’s Land.  😂
You should do the Armenian genocide
Back in historical times when the only way to chat on the internet was with MSN or Yahoo Messenger, I used to have a close friend in Canada who told me many Canadians believe the US will eventually annex Canada for their drinking water. I don't know. Trump probably would have tried, if he'd thought of it, but I don't Biden has that kind of Moxy. Maybe if DeSantis becomes president. I could definitely see him as an imperialist asshole.
Yo I just learned about this in History
௹
America:mmmm finally freedom Everybody else:so like slaves?
This video counts as an official declaration of war
Oh shoot, just realized I wasn't subscribed. Aw shoot my bad. Here you go bro
The transition to the sponsor is always so smooth
Bravo
Yeeee... Finally we get our beloved oversimplified new video😍
Everyone says about Canada what about Mexico
So, this was basically 19th century Cuba missile Crisis?
OverSimplified goes for quality over quantity. So much so that when theu release a new episode it is a big event
why are his sponsor transitions so good lol
16:01 totally unrealistic that should be an m4
I started crying laughing at the rant about Canada at the end lmao
The pig spoke with the voice of God. WTF?!?
i’m learning bout this rn in school😭 i’m so glad i found this
the question at 37:18 is answered by the image at 38:12
What about Mexicans huh u don't include them as much
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running" 😂
This by far was the funniest video 😂😂 I almost spit out my drink amazing content!!
Then ending is epic! Scary, but epic.
29:14 i like to imagine that he stuffed his face against a pillow to voice the president hiding in the curtain
Man i've been watching your videos for a long time and this one... I've gotta buy some of your merch now.. you just outdid yourself seven fold.
I want to see the Russian civil war
I somehow heard alot of rhyme in this video lmao
Biden's coming baby😂😂
:oooooo
You should do a recent war like the Iraq or Afghan war
13:28 Kills me every single time 😂
Just wow!
Your hatred towards white people is palpable
Good morning kitten is a real website?!
One word: NATO
You are so crazy man I love your videos
keep your potatos out of my pig A british person-
Which  country that oversimplified's video about hitler?i didnt know that until i watched the nord vpn part
rip pig
Straight line
Did that mf pig turn into Morgan freeman? 😳
I hope Canada invades USA, and kill all the racist neo nazis and the KKK, and make Trump get murdered by all the children he locked without parents at the border!  If the number one economy in the world was Canada things would be much nicer!
Bro, that Morgan Freeman voice
infested with the- oh no
Truly butyfull
He said “what cum” county. It’s “Walk cum” county.
Only 2 days ago!?!?
GET OFF MY PROPERTY  a random british person
that be the way things are eh A sheriff-
33:30 got me dead beo
I'm pretty sure US, in their history, would not start a war by intentionally shooting someone, right? They diffused this situation, so future actions will also be diffused, right?  *Philippine-American War intensifies*
When we needed him most, he returned
I find it so awesome that I recommended he do Manifest Destiny in one of his previous videos and finally come to fruition years later... Thank you so much! I wrote my Master's thesis on Manifest Destiny
31:02
Yeehaw!!
That end was fucking hilarious
You should do the war of 1812 eh?
O no he’s going to start a war
I love these videos. Entertaining and you actually learn stuff.
Can we talk about how Charles Griffin's moustache looks like two people doing a High-five ? 11:43
That end segment has to be one of the best things i've seen on Youtube thus far
Holy crap, the ending.
*_Because of Protestanism, America was born. And here they go, explore the west, lol._*  *_Now that's a lot of effort in this video. Also, this is basically another island struggle (Spratly, in Asia)..._*
That pig looks suspiciously like waddles 😂
I can see América taking Canada, It will be amazing.
16:29 HIS FACE AND VOICE KILLED ME
More vids i love history and how funny you are
STRAIGHT LINE YAHOO
i feel like i just watched a movie
just a thought, oversimplified war on terror/war in the middle east
Please post more 😭😭😭
Thanks for the early Christmas gift
It took you some time to post your latest video hehe I really miss your voice
lets make the world a better place 20 years of manifest destiny Lets rename us the world empire
"what the f" that wasplayed perfectly
This upload just made my day even better :)
33:24 you can actually see him
Please do a video on the Native American's (before colonist settlement). I love these videos! Amazing! Well done!
200 years later:  Straight line? Straight line.
its always a good day when Oversimplified uploads <3
worry about your own curves Some british person-
Add more Canada
I loved that ending I was laughing the entire time with the conquering Canada thing.
That’s a good ending
Oh my god. Watching Scott beat the explitive out of Harney felt sooooooo good.
Sheriff Barnes looks suspiciously like one Joseph Stalin 👀😂😂😂
holy shit its another video
Hey there was a Hey Arnold episode based on this.
Morgan Freeman?!
6 minutes and 58 seconds in, my internet dropped out, and the video froze, so what I heard was “…bickering over boundaries, manifesting destiny, and a joint.”   …end of sentence.
biden's coming? 🤨
Absolutely incredible video!! The jokes were spot on. Keep it up, I can't wait to watch more videos!
Great video!! :)
I love that this war just boils down to 90% of the people involved being idiots
And the Honey War (1839) will be next then?
Interesting don’t live far from these San Juan islands never been also maybe a 45min ride to the ferry an bam ill be there
I am Canadian.
Thanks for the early Christmas gift
The part where he says “and endless comments complaining that I DON’T TALK ABOUT CANADA ENOUGH IN MY VIDEOS-“ just killed me. Like damn, that’s a side I haven’t heard from him
33:26 is perfect for out of context
omfg im 2 days late no!!!!!
“It was billy, right?”  “I thought it was Sharon’s cat.”  “I hear voices ALL the time.”  That. Was brilliant, and hilarious :) 3:50
Can’t even explain how hyped I get when you post a video
The fact that we get free documentaries on YouTube by OverSimplified is truly a gift.  🤚
"BIDENS COMING BABY!" yeah right yanks lmao hard too oversee the Frontlines when your in bed at 7pm
I can't say I expected that ending, but as an American I'm proud to know we've got a plan
HI*
OH MY GOSH ONEOF MY FAVORITE HISTORY GUYS POSTED HU
Did anyone else see the way florida appeared when he said the us wanted to expand
Please make videos related to other boring subjects like polity, geography, etc... Your videos are just awesome 😊
I did a presentation on the Pig War for APUSH and I let out an audible “oh my god” when I saw this. I’m so glad this ridiculous, obscure bit of history is finally getting more attention (and you certainly did a much better job presenting it than I did!)
amazing.
Had to click because it's local to me!! So funny and good, but, not quite the local pronunciation of 'Whatcom' :P  Still, very nice to see about something we learn about here! Very glad the San Juans ended up with the US, they are beautiful :)
Vietnam war next?
Why you got to give us Canadians nightmares?
Man I fucking love America
War because of pig
Hey man, I love the content your doing its progressively getting more and more entertaining! You should bring some MiniWars back! You should try the Java War, or maybe some Spanish-American Wars of Independence, Greco-Persian Wars, etc. would be really interesting to see.
another day for asking the Rise of the mongolian empire.
Next the winter war
i learned more about manifest destiny in the literal 10 seconds you took to explain it than i did in this entire last semester of my college history course on the subject
I dare you to make a video on the complete history of the holy Roman empire
Hahaha 😂
I genuinely thought the pig was voiced by Ian McKellen.
I thought it was about pig
Wow, Fort Vancouver.  I literally drive past the place on my way to work.
THIS ISNT VIETNAM! THIS IS NEW JERSEY WHAT THE FUCK!
THE WAIT IS OVER ONCE MORE
Can you do a Joseph Stalin vid or Roman empires
Ending was - 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Honestly as a border American I'm totally for this cause then we can ban pronunciations like aboot and anyhu
Yup lets conquer Canada. I want that syrup.
New post yay
Challenged excepted. So how should we decide this, uno? Halo? Chess?
Straight line
I literally learned about manifest destiny like a month ago so when he started explaining it I was like manifest destiny I now know the answer to why Oregon was where it was my American studies teacher did not explain to me how Oregon became part of the US this did
You know continuing to manifest destiny is not a bad idea, more stuff for Russia to take later.
Honestly hes gonna NEED these sponsors if he's gonna pay for the army. Unless they just let the US take over, though the USA did lose to them at one point.
me crying patriotic tears and saluting the invasion of Canada under our fearless leader drake
The 6 month wait for oversimplified to upload again was worth it
It is uncool that US did not agree for a compromise
HAHAHAHHA THE ENDING HAHAHA LOL XD! "ONE EYA OPEN AT NIGHT!""
That Shrek reference at 7:57 tho
Yoo
Gee whiz I sure love isitasoup period commercial!
Indians are constantly kill hundreds in continuous warfare in order to conquer each other’s land. But the Americans conquer all of them and make them stop fighting while also bringing them into the greatest civilizations of human history, the west. But white man bad cause self loathing I guess.
America D is Florida so all those storm..... 🧐 🤔3:31
Gotta love that Star Wars reference in the thumbnail. This whole video is just 👌
30:29 Oh. My. God.
The ending to this was actually one of the most perfect endings for a video on youtube. Kuddos 👍
Christmas has come early
I love this
Came into this thinking about the Bay of Pigs, left with oversimplified threatening to invade Canada.
A story that every PNW elementary school child lucky enough to attend Camp Orc-Isla or a Fort Casey field trip is treated to at least once in their life. This telling of the tale was much more entertaining, to be sure.
Oh, so THATS what the song War Pigs is about.
13:28
What’s up with the plushies design it’s so simplified and it’s ✨beautiful✨
30:43 its a mark
I'm going to level with you man, the ending was hilarious, but the thought of Biden leading me was scarier than having to deal with the American military.
I live on Vancouver island
13 on trending…          Noice
oh no... i live only 50 km from the us border in metro vancouver!!!!!!!
*me sees the vid*  Ugh.... Typical America. This is why I rarely use  oil in cooking since America would invade if I use too much
4:11 is probably the biggest laugh I've gotten out of all of your videos.  Legitimate laugh-cry.  Kudos, sir.
Quality over quantity. Good job again.
James Douglas thinks the whole globe is British
Finally, a new episode...so happy.
The British: NO! Don’t take our land! We worked so hard on getting it! It took us a whole twenty minutes to get
3:36 hmm, Florida looks quite exquisite
I’m honored to hv my name in a vid by my favorite YouTuber (Steven is my name)
More than 100 people: *voiced by the same guy*
Yes...        Good
All for a pig lmao
The presentation of the USA as a destroying swarm of locusts is spot on.
33:21 Oh god. Got to admit. That is probably one of the funniest scenes i've seen in any over simplified video yet. Just the voices, the sounds, the animation. Everything was on point haha! Well done!
Canada: here, let's split the land so it protects both our interests.  America: that does seem rational, AND I'LL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN!
I cannot count the amount of times this guy has attacked me
Thank you so much for this amazing content
america invading canada would go alot like anyone trying to invade russia during winter. were so far apart all it would take is a few well placed charges of dynamite and invasion becomes a grueling task.
He should do one on the invasion of Manchuria
"Harney Hated being told what to do." Then...why did he join the Army?!
"I thought it was sharen's cat"
That ending was awesome!!!!
Did did you know guys thanks and I was actually going to go to war because of the border dispute in Minnesota. I just researched it out because I’m fathers videos so interesting and oversimplified can you please do that! I love your channel and you should do more interesting wars in the Midwest.
Now THAT’S How you end a video.
The ending could cause a war lol
“The Americans kept coming and they didn’t stop coming, they hoped in their wagons and hit the ground running”  -Oversimplified 2021
Missed you so much. It's been a while since your last upload. I'm glad you're back again.🌻🙌
got exams and its gonna be 3am by the time i finish this why the fuck do i have to find this in my recommended now lmao
Lake of the woods is best fishing
YES HE POSTED
I’m Canadian, and that ending to the video made me laugh so much. Thank you for adding it in, it made my day :)
Return of the king
33:28 ahahahahahaa
When both British and American troops celebrated each others’ national holidays together, that was pretty wholesome tbh
CONGRADS on Trending
As a Canadian I feel like now would be the best time to serve our nation in fight against joe Biden
Best “Up you” to Canada every
war pigs?
we miss mr oversimplified
Biden is the one man that could actually fuck up an invasion of Canada😂
As an American, there's so much fire in my blood it's melting my high cholesterol.
Why do I want to play Kerbal Space Program all of a HEY WAIT A SECOND.
that ending was unironically the best voice acting we've ever heard on this channel
“And being Americans they pulled guns” USA USA USA
He posted!!!!!!!
200 years in the future. "Did America almost started a war with Canada over a Youtube video?"
Sheesh PIGS
Yayayayayayayayayayaya ...Finally I don't have to watch those old videos for 6 months
20:26 meet me at the Carretera Calle
Prob one of the funniest videos ever hahaha
Well, that escalated quickly at the end there
The manifest destiny bit had to be the funniest history thing I've seen
You, huh.... you alright there at the end? Who spat in your (imported) maple syrup?
With a subtle homage to the "F-U" scene in Half-Baked at 32:30 😎
He's finally back after half a year
54 40 or fight!!
Why would anyone want to invade Canada? We don't really have anything up here.
Yeeeee  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW
Damn you're so good man. Nice work , well well done. Only the thing that panama chanal started to be build în 1881 witch at the time they couldn't reach so easy the pacific ocean from Est coast or Europe.  But is a small detail.  I love you work
I don’t even like history classes that much but this guy just makes me want to watch 2 hours of the French Revolution😂
This has such an amazing production quality. The writing here is on point and I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said “That looks freaking amazing.” 💕 Much love to Oversimplified!! The T.V. Networks need to watch your vids and learn how it’s done
The return of the king
That one pig plottwisting speech has me weak for laughter to this day
Ooooh noooooo
watch out canadians ima throw hands with ya
This is now one of my favorites of Oversimplified! Excellent! I haven't laughed so hard in a long time
Non! nous garderons notre syrop d'erable jusqu'a la fin! Vous ne tacherez jamais notre drapeau et notre fierte
Pig war...Angrybirds...
I live on Vancouver Island an hour away from Victoria
I love how oversimplified introduces us to the wars that most people haven’t heard about
If we ever declared war on Canada, I'm electing oversimplified as the general of the U.S army.
The funniest part of that video is the idea that Biden is capable of anything more than shitting in his depends.
For a 19th century standard, it is rather surprising, that no war erupted.
I would hate to be an American dying in 2025 on the Quebecian meat grinder. French Canadians are not a people I want to mess with
This is just the lord of the flies lmao
Love this episode, so hilarious and educational 😁
can you make an nordVPN character pin:)
Biden's coming in a couplde different ways
Vietnam war is next
im just saying but i got 300hrs on oversimplified videos not to flex
Woah, Oversimplified you got a little too based there at the end
That ending is the funniest thing I've see this month
I love the re-occurring national emblem playing
Do a video on the Reddit Tik tok war
Not a fan that there are Americans who have to drive thru Canada just to get south of the lakes. It's just...disorderly.
LET’S INVADE CANADA!!! USA! USA! USA! 🇺🇸🦅
im high, very funny vid
what the thuck
7 years war pls next
Idiocy is not new. It's been with us since before Rome. It's just everyone got louder.
This video was all well and good, but Canada totally won the war of 1812. America's goal was to conquer more land, it was Canada's goal to defend that land. Canada succeeded in their goal, America did not. And the White House got burned down... Seems like an American loss.
I love how americans are always firing off their guns
I don't know what's more likely: Biden conquering Canada Biden joining Canada. Either way, he will crap his pants and say something incoherent.
I was generally shocked that I knew who General Scott was (he came up with the anaconda plan to blockade the south during the Civil War)
thanks for doing this on my b-day
33:29 when i catch someone stealing my tacos
*Claim your Here within a week ticket*
Do an american filipino war
i love this
WATCH YOUR BACK CANADIANS  SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN TONIGHT CAUSE BIDEN'S COMING BABY AND THIS TIME WITH A VENGEANCE!!!!!!!! best
I love how he mentioned BTS
Ready to laugh and ready to learn
Man British people they are just everywhere with their Tea, Maple Syrup and Guns
Seeing a oversimplified video with someone with legs in it feels cursed
Love your videos man. And I think you should do a Mexican war video or the battle of the Alamo. Keep up the great work.😀❤️🔥
Best video ever
FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN EMPIRE
thankyou for your videos they are always so fun to watch i love the comedy you put in it
The writers: So how long does this pot take to- tooOoOooOo… oh my god this is wow  Me watching this and being a long time fan: what the hell this is crazy and ridonkulous even for you guys
Hell yeah new episode
As a Canadian, my biggest fear is becoming an American. 🇨🇦
Notice how his whole rant about Canada was exactly as long as the glorious National Anthem of the United States
Well worth the wait
I'm really fired up to annex Canada now
AT LONG LAST! The mighty has returned
thx alot broooooooooooooo
3:35 Florida
To be fair, harney's plan to start the war is actually pretty clever
British vs America!? This has never happened before! 100%!
I can't believe it took me three times to hear the All Star parody here 7:57
bro wtf is the ending LOL
"Biden's coming" makes the Canadians laugh their butts off. The most bumblin' fool as "President".
18:45 Those birds were really well animated.
That would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interess of both parties, and there is now way im going to agree with it...USA in a nutshell
Oh no, I hate my life  I didn’t say they were white people  YAYAYAYAYAYAYA  I died
Lyman shot the PIG.
My. Milk expired
Bought to binge  all of his videos for the 50th time
was that a "Touchable" reference I heard 🤔
"Bidens coming" not worried, by the time he gets here he wont remember why hes here.
I love your videos they are amazing and so funny never stop please
I learn more from this guy then my history tracher
Oookay, he's gone off the deep end
Poor pig
How'd you get Morgan Freeman to do a voice over for you?
Another 6 month???
And Biden is gonna freeze 😂  Have you seen how cold Canada is for 6 months
Me, sitting on Fidalgo island: 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Also: Canada is still part of the commonwealth, you forgot the part where we invade Canada and have to fight the British (and likely the EU, even if they’re fighting right now)
this is a piece of history I did not know about, which after 40 years on this planet is a unique occurrence.     Also, I got sneezed on by an Orca around these island back in 2012.   True Story.
It's gonna be pretty ironic when in 30 years someone uploads a video about how the last 3 minutes of some random video about a Pig started a war between the US and Canada
18:17 potato kinda sounds like Kermit 🤔
Welcome back to youtube
great video…we’ll see you in 6 months
I loved your video, nicely done, but that ending makes me dislike this video very much. I wish you wouldn't put in anyones head to start a war with neighbours. OverSimplified, I love you, but I'm Canadian and SUK-EH my potatoes.
WHAAAATTHAAAAA hell was that at the end? I bet you are triggered by Barney Stinsons' hate for Canada xDxDxD
The hudson bay copompany is still here. wow.
i was here before ludwig thats cool
Hey
Murica 🇺🇸🥓
"I've always hated you" (Harney screaming like a noob)
Best video so far
Love the end and just how he puts the into like instantly
was that morgan freeman?!
11:07 Every War for petty reasons be like:
Could you do one about Las Vegas if you haven't already?
Another funny history video, I love it
I've never heard oversimplified with a louder voice... always the smooth quiet voice.
NO WAY A NEW OVERSIMPLYFIED VIDEO!?!??
You know why us Canadian burn the white house. They set our parliament and a part off ochilaga(Montreal) on fire. But still i think we were all a bit extremist at the time. Oh! A other thing. You maybe have man power but we have the commonwealth power. Plus the best neighbor...yes...you know who i am speaking about.
Ah! Here's a request, please please cover Palestine- Israel conflict!
Honestly these just keep getting better and better
To be honest. At that time, America probably wouldn't stand a chance
29:17 BUCHANAN
I think it'd be really cool if oversimplified tried to do some ancient history, or even ancient stories like those from Herodotus, Plutarch, or perhaps even the fall of the Roman Republic.
I like how everytime we take land we put down a McDonald's
Yo oversimplefied, could you do a video about the Japanese in world war 2? u covered them slightly, but I am really interested what kind of weird politics happened there before and after the war.
Dude that pig looks like Waddles from Grabity Falls
Long live Canada and I would like to see you try it. bitches !!
It’s really important to note that James Douglas was black so Americans encroaching on his territory didn’t just mean losing power but also his humanity under there system.
USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA
no canada talk mister and go to your room no vidio games for a week for oversimplified
Justice for Spuddy
I’m glad he took his time  for this one. This is by far the most entertaining video he has done. Well done! I could not stop laughing 😂
Lol I never heard of this one.
who else thought the pig on the thumbnail thought it was a puffle?
That ending..... XD  Go home, oversimplified. You're drunk!
I hope Vietnam War will be next pls
7:57  roflmao, Shrek mus…ehrmm Smash Mouth song reference.
The Return Of The King
Awesome ending.
9:19 James Douglass: O.O WHAT DO YOU PEEPING TOMS WANT FROM ME?!?!?!
SOON THE CANADIAN GIRL FRIENDS WILL BE AMERICAN GIRL FRIENDS!!!!
A single spark can start a prairie fire.
Not stolen, conquered!
James Douglas was half black so why did you draw him as white as a Scottish lad who’s never seen the sun
Awsome man loved it but I thought Biden liked Canada lol
stop ogling Canada take Mexico
You should make a video just on the war of 1812 itself next maybe
My favorite part was when they decided on manifest destiny so hard that they instantly developed stealh bombers
That ending was the scariest thing I've ever seen as a Canadian.
The comedy is gold!    “That’s a poor person” 😂
Canadian here: loved that you covered the Pig War. Actually heard about it on an episode of This Is That where they talked about the shooting of the pig in a guy's garden & how everyone is prepped for a fight that never happened. Best war IMO 👍
GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we will invade canada
Wat DA HEEEEL
left
I’m a really crying over a pig😭😭😭
8:50  The map on the left....  Something do with Vietnam in the future? Perhaps?
Nothing beats procrastinating my essay.
who was in Paris?
So we ain't gonna talk how the new plushie is soooooooooooooooooooo cute?
Do a Video on Andrew Jackson
Wow uhhh..didn't expect that for an ending lol.
when oversimplified uploads  ❤️_❤️
Bruh this guy sounds like plankton
Way to roast a whole fanbase with that spuddy reference! 10/10
Awesome
I absolutely died at the end
`Imma be real, at this point Joe Biden likely would go to war over the stupid shit, simply because he's reading off scripts`
Petition for oversimplified to cover a more modern war like the Iraq war
No wonder WA state is so f*cked up. It's always been f*cked up.
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Biden started a war, thought I think I'd most likely be another war against Mexico. Despite the pointless Healthcare, Canada is actually pretty chill.
every canadian a the end of the video, talking to british: mom, brother's cringe... british: i know my son, i know.......
This whole war can be summed up in one sentence; "wow, that's so American."
Emotionally fuelled beatings are another thing I add to my "things that shouldn't make me laugh but do" list
JAMES K POLK IS A GOAT
22:17 wasnt the Panama canal built much later?
33:25 he is stalking him
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER NEW VIDEO
*America and Britain throughout the 18th and 19th centuries:*  America: “I HATE YOUR STUPID ACCENT! AND YOUR FOOD IS TERRIBLE!” Britain: “I HATE _YOUR STUPID_ ACCENT! AND YOUR FOOD GIVES ME HEART DISEASE!”  *America and Britain from the 20th century onward:*  Britain: “Wanna go spread freedom and democracy and kick some dictatorship arse while we’re at it?” America: *”Say no more. I’ll bring the guns.”*
5:32 I didn't know that the wind blows 2 ways at once in Washington and Oregon! :O
I bet OverSimplified won't pin this comment
What if Canada killed Us’s pig
10/10 my favorite video todate keep it up!!!!
Spanish Civil War Video!!!!!!!!!
Oversimplified should do one about the Fenian raids
I love how he just lost it at the end
Finally yes pls keep making these they are THE BEST
Hahahahah last part got me
14:35 so that’s how it is uh?
ok but why is the Potato wearing Sonic the Hedgehog shoes? ...OR y'all can get conquered by Canada, get legal weed, free Healthcare & now ALL the videos on the US would count as you already making videos of Canadian hystory
This video is pure gold.
Babe wake up new OverSimplified post
Good video
Thank you
26:00 man the delivery of that line is so good always get a laugh out of me lol
Still doesn't talk about canada enough
This is why Czechoslovakia speak Spanish
I sure do love the Lorax
You no longer sell merch? :(
What is the name of music at 27:14?
Me: *Walks into PawnStars* Me: "This is the pigs head I found on the San Juan Islands of the pig that almost started a war." Rick: "Woah now thats cool, I don't know anything about this let me call a friend whos an expert in big skulls."  Later....  Rick: "Best I can do is $25 I take all the risk and you get cash."
A new Oversimplified video around Christmas is the best present we ever had!!!
7:57 wait that sounds like a song
This one's the funniest one yet
Wars of pig
One of my favorites youtube channel to watch :)
Watch out camda
This is your best work you have really improved your story telling and aminations
7:57 For people who think it’s a great line
The end is so hilarious that I think it's one of the best endings on YouTube or any video. Ever. Please do more endings like this.
Virgin American: You’re Fat, Ben Franklin Chad British: You should worry about your own curves, Benjamin!
Did Oversimplified single handedly declare war on Canada for the United States?...and talk about controversial political politics and politicians without whole arguments in the comments or get canceled? What a guy
Are there any records of why the Kaiser made the decision he did or is it something lost to history?
0:10 Gentlemen, we got him
This was epic!!!!
Bruh you came back for us???
Quite possibly the best, funniest episode so far…
FINALLY A NEW VID
Definitely liked the ending. Really got me thinking.
You can always do that Vietnam war video
Your videos help me understand a lot about history as this helps me for my advance classes that I got right now, your videos is one of my favorite right now and I love to see more soon. I got a question added, why do your videos take long to upload or create? I’m just eager to see more lol
Joke aside, I wouldn't mind if we joined the US haha!
20:40. If you hate being told what to do then I don't think president would be a fitting job
39:06
He's actually losing it
whatcom county gang
37:09
Can you make a vid on the Spanish civil war? I'm from Spain but I have no idea about what the hell went wrong, pls.
CANADA IS A JOKE
Next Mexican American war!
3:33 oh no poor Florida!
The Reason Why America Can't Conquer Canada Is Because We Won't Accept Their Laws
Lets Go Brandon
but is it a soup tho
I am just here to see the North VPN ad.
God bless America
It's funny how Oversimplified went from being maybe over simplified to now being not at all over simplified
Jokes are on point in this one
I died when I saw that McDonald’s get slam dunked 😂😂
bruh how are genshin impact and tommyinnit above this video in american trending, so stupid
“Woah woah woah i didn’t say they where white people” Here comes twitter
FINALLY HE POSTED        love the vid
Straight Line?
Why is everyone talking about a far cry 3 reference around the 33:15 mark I don’t understand
No more videos for 6 months
“Potato seeds”
It’s weird to see my county on my favorite videos😂
who's john picket again i heard of him in school some where
7:51 why does he start singing all star I love it
38:10 holy shit
31:01 Best scene in this entire video, by far. That Morgan Freeman voice is on point.
Still waiting for the vietnam war oversimplified
Can u do a oversimplified ego eradication for our entitled population? Asking for a friend.
3:54 "I hear voices all the time"
The pig death scene was hilarious. Top tier video. Keep it up. 😂👌 👍👍👍
6 months of waiting worth it
He might be put into an a coma whatch out
That ending….this man speced into charisma and intelligence
Fun video. Again. Thanks man. You‘re one of a kind.
the pig was a skinwalker
you dont talk about canada enough in your videos
33:29 FBI OPEN UP
Can you try doing The Potato War?
Bri ish when America "kinda  cringe innit bruv?"
Now THIS is the level of bullshit that Victoria 2 Crises were made for
Maybe new vid Texas revolution
The return of the king.
I hear voices all the time... 3:54
He gets so heated at the end I love it XD
Help I’m Canadian I don’t want joseph Biden dancing through the streets of Ottawa or Vancouver please someone do something to stop the American-Canadian war
Best vid yet
Oversimplified has the House of Commons down to a T... bravo and ORDERRRRRR
You should do Jamaican History should be fun. :-)
😂😂😂 amazing vid
I AGREE WITH THE END 100% WE INAVDE AND WE END THINGS HOW IT SHOULD OF BEEN ENDED ALONG TIME AGO!!!!!!!!!
I think this is the peak of oversimplified videos
best 38 minutes of my life
Bro ur channel so good
I insist that we need a mini-series based on latin american independancy
The pig looks like Waffles from Gravity Falls
What? You Americans have lost the opportunity to start a war for so little? I'm ashamed
Love the Star Wars inspired thumbnail :))
Oversimplified is just THE BOMB. I'm always waiting for his videos!!
do ferdinand marcos PLEASE CUZ NOBODY KNOWS THE 70s WERE BAD IN THE PHI-
Referring to people as rats or a disease is INCREDIBLY disturbing, considering what politicians HAVE referred to people like rats or a disease.
Wher were you
37:30 38:00 33:10 Also this video looks like the disc war except the war never happened
finally
Can't Wait for the 'Vietnam War - OverSimplified'
hey can you do a alexander the great video i think itll be good
But drakes a Canadian! 😡
So in the war of 1812... The US attempted to invade Canada, and failed. And the British attempted to burn down the White House , and succeeded.  Only the black knight would call that a draw!
The end killed me lmfaoooo
The weird nationalistic speech at the end reminded me when in Roblox Rise of Nations a USA player lost to Canada and the Canada players built aircraft carriers in the lakes
Smoothest ad break yet
Yesssss
Nice to have you back man
And now again waiting for new masterpiece :c
To be fair, this wasn't the first time (or the only time) that parts of the US went to war over who gets to collect taxes. For instance, there was the Iowa-Missouri Territory dispute that went to the US Supreme Court and US Congress. It also threatened to derail Iowa's bid to become a state. There are others.
Every five months I look forward to this 🥰
Subtitle nya mana njir
8:06 their brains got smart but their heads got dumb
waiting for ur videos is worth it broder
Deja vu
"I didn't say they were white people". Yawn.
Shout-out to Pickett for being completely incompetent, couldn't have done this without you.
Damn you’re good at this
Considering this whole mess happened in 1859, and I could be wrong, but calculated for today's inflation, $100 then would roughly be the equivalent of $3,332.40... I can see why Lyman outright refused to pay it.
I saw this when it was premi3 but I forgit to place a comment about how american the ending was.
D
For me the best YT channels are Oversimplified and Dr. Todd Grande.... Informative and Factual.... YAY!
As funny as always I mean..history. Haha..:/
I see what you did with the rainbow there It was gods love poured out to them for listening!
Emu war? Would make an interesting video
I am so happy your back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fak war how about a facereveal?
OverSimplidied, this is the funniest video you have made thus far!
Petition to Make an "Undersimplified" channel so we can get hours long videos!
Ah, This video was made in my birthday. Perfect git, Perfection
The ending is the first time I’ve heard true real emotion from him
Oversimplified is like our unofficial History teacher
nothing could have prepared ourselves for the unbridled, raw, canadian-induced patriotism at the end
You know waddey say US-eh
this guy is unbelievable
Im canadian PLS  DONT PLS
do a vid about the mexican american war plssssssssssssss
He did it    he made a new video
Well done solving the dispute peacefully. It's so stupid many countries still have disputes over tiny pieces of land.
Day 3 of commenting on oversim vids for the yt algorithm
Best ending to any YouTube video ever. This man outdoes himself every time.
Do the korean war
The biggest unnecessary war drama be like
Screw Canada. They've had it too good for too long.
Looking back in history. and people from the future will say "Did that really fucking happened?"
i swear everybody 150 years ago were a bunch of grown ass toddlers
7:56 LOVE the all star reference 😆
Pig Wars: Revenge of The British
Would like to see an oversimplified alexander the great, julius caesar, rise and fall of the roman empire, emperor nero, the carolingian empire, attila the hun, genghis khan, vlad the impaler, the ottoman empire
21:26 Captain Pickett looks awfully similar to a certain weapons historian and Francophile....
31:42
It ended the only way it could... no SHOULD have.
over simplified videos and always good
I never comment on YouTube videos. That said, the amount of work, research, and sheer creativity that went into this video warranted my first, and most likely last comment, which is to say: 👏🏼 👌🏼
Been long of enough
USA : YEE HAH!!!!!
A moment of cilence for the pig and potatoes
I,m Canadian 🇨🇦🇨🇦
Can you do the Russian civil war next I really want to learn more about it.
Ayeee I thought he disappeared
Can't wait another 6 months for the next upload
Oo I think an idea for a video would be to do the Winter War :D if ur reading this ty
He’s back
This was emotional enough, but by that ending I was in tears. Looks out Canada
37:08 who knew Oversimplified loved the idea of "Manifest Destiny"
I never knew beavers shaved into tophats..... and the natives in the HBC colors.... this video is too much!   Shoulda just traded Point Roberts to us for the island.   PS Remember 1812, we'll do it again, eh! And we won't be sorry aboot it.
<gets to the end>   WHY CAN I NOT GIVE THIS VIDEO 100 LIKES!  DAMN YOU CANADA!!!!!!!
The end was so legendary
Flawless, from start to finish, as always
Thank you for making awesome videos!
The jokes were overdone, repetitive, and childish, the video was padded way too long, there were grammatical errors and plenty of enunciation problems, including tourist sounding like "terrorist" and using parlay instead of parley, I'm not exactly sure what the Panama Canal animation was for when it didn't even exist yet, the trivializing of it all as "just a pig" seemed asinine, and the whole end segment reeked of trying too hard and what is Biden going to avenge for exactly? Maybe should have found a more anti-Canada person to run the joke with. Probably the least interesting and most boring video from Oversimplified yet, stretching a funny anecdote into a 39-minute snorefest filled with fluff.
I shed a single tear of joy when this appeared in my feed
54'40" or bust
Big fan keep making videos love them !
Best ending to a video ever
7:58-8:03 is that a *WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP* reference?
Where’s the superlike button
This video is the funniest oversimplified video yet.
I’ve said it many times, why do we allow Canada to exist?
As a Canadian the idea of drake leading all of North America sounds amazing
Steamy mcsteam face nice reference
That ending caught me off guard. And I loved it
"Straight Line" ? "Straight Line".
Ok
As a Canadian I am genuinely terrified
Ah, "Carretera Calle". My favorite carretera... calle.
0:45 as if white people haven’t tried to conquer each other before.
I love these videos but where does he find all this specific information at lmao!
51st state
That ending, looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
YES FINALLY WE WILL CLIMB THE ICE WALL AND INVADE CANADA! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
Yay! A new video!
BRO THANK YOU BUT PLEASE JUST DO A VEITNAM VIDEO ALREADY
Lol do I realize when I look at the American flag at the beginning was stock images lol
2:36 spoken like a true american
In Indonesian its not trending
Land belongs to those who can defend it. It's a shame you decided to jump on the self hating leftist train.
Ending is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oversimplified should be a history teacher
W Adin Ross
That Canada speech is the most emotion I have ever heard in his voice by FAR
HOG!
Over a pig
YESSSS NEW VIDEOOOO!!!
I would not be surprised if Biden decided to invade Canada because the idea seemed to be trending on Instagram or something
I don't need Christmas day if this man releases a video
Would be interesting what would happen, wonder if it would of resulted in the civil war coming sooner and the british joining the confederates. Dam so much would changed kinda scary to think about...
Texas revolution

In a couple of years:  “The Canada Conquest of 2023 was an American attempt to take over the land of maple syrup. Inspired by a definitely anonymous youtuber, this spelt despair for the hockey players and poutinists alike.
5:21 halo players in a fight
*Technoblade?*
THE COMEDY GETS BETTER AND BETTER EVERY TIME 😂
13:30: How much of this is meant literal by Oversimplified?
God freaking dammit the jokes are too good 🤣
How did I miss this notification?!  So excited about this!
Well... Oversimplified for president, 2024. "Coming with a vengeance!"
It's Sam O Nella but more somehow
i was born half a mile from fort vancouver and my mother died half a mile from fort vancouver
This video was absolutely phenomenal
There's an oversimplified on Hitler? Why is that blocked in the UK?
THE MAN IS BACK BOIS
If USA ever takes over Canada The only good that is left in North America Will be gone...   Mucho Lovo Canadians From a Young Canadian Loving European Damsel!
All Canadians and French Canadians like this video and the show me that online Canadian army
Seems to me he needs to talk about Canada more!
This ending bro 😂
Im about to have a history on the manifest destiny tomorrow, thanks for the refresher.
That was amazing
I like how the US and Britain were in dispute and felt the Germans were the best to. Go to😂
OVERSIMPLIFIED IS BACK LETS GOOOOOOOO
16:00 using a Russian rifle
Sometimes I worry for your mental health.
In all seriousness though; we're invading Canada, right?
Amazing video as always, you can make anything in history intresting (maybe thats cuz I love history haha) keep up the good work 🔥🔥
my friends were talking about this at school and youtube suggested it to me I'm mildly concerned for my safety
Best one yet. Thank you for the laugh and history lesson!
Yesterday I was bored as hell and I wished oversimplified uploaded and then I saw pig war I was like my wishes come true and I was like lol.
Was the treaty of Paris in 1783
The ending just reminds me of the song, Vengeance by Neoni, Saint Cardinal, and Silverburg
That ending XD I'm dying
32:00 Out of context moment
I lvoe how his simple art is getting better and better in movements
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Best video yet
I have never laughed so hard at the end of a video
13:06 is the FUNNIEST PART. How they're talking in sheep somehow is humorously funny
ok
New over simpleted
I am scared for my life right now.
Amateur...
Proud Canadian
If this was uploaded on April 1st, no one would believe it was true. However, because we are strange creatures, we believe what people tell us on the other 364 days of the year for some arbitrary reason.
United States: No thanks I prefer Canda as an ally Canada: Thanks dude :)
I’m really liking that last part
32:30 is that a half baked reference
He started to sound like the news cast fish from SpongeBob
The Canadians have been real quiet lately
IN JUST A FEW DAYS THIS VID GOT 3 MIL VIEWS AND IS ON #8 ON TRENDING LETS GO OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!
🍪👍
Babe wake up new oversimplified just dropped
Biden will get confused and end up invading mexico 😏😏
Anyone have a link the the end credit song?
Please invade Mexico instead
America,  Grow Up.
Is it me? Or when oversimplified gave america legs, florida looks like a .......
Almost thought you were gonna leave Trudeau in charge there. Had me worried there
the pig looks like waddles
Harney: *puts pickett on the island* This angered Scott, *Who punished him severely*
I was 4 min in and checked how long this was and I was very happy to find that it was 38 minutes. Well done 👍🏼
a video of the life of Geroge Washgtion
“Lyman, if you spare my life , i grant you 3 wishes
I don’t mean to cause any problems eh
Es hoy, es hoy!!!
29:19 that noise 😂
I love this
Taking the flag pole is the best passive aggressive move ever, I'd love to think that was a order from the higher ups.
It’s only a matter of time…
That product integration starting from 5:37 was a nice sneak attack 👌🏽
Scott in Mexico: WOW. Harney is an idiot. Good riddance to him. Glad I will never see him again.  Buchanan: You gonna do it again, but this time riddled with gout.
To be fair, the destruction of Washington was in retaliation for an earlier US attack on the Parliament of Lower Canada at York (now Toronto). The US also looted, taking a royal standard, the first Mace of Ontario, a golden staff used by Upper Canada's Parliament, and a lion statuette, carved out of wood and painted gold.  So, told them to pound sand. Today, the standard and lion are just two of the hundreds of "trophies of war" on display at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.
That plushi so kawai 🤧🥺
Americans: Hand over the oil. The Spanish: Hand over the gold. The Dutch: Give me the plant. The British: We’ve come for your beavers…
Lol we are currently learning about Canadian history in history
Make German unification
Plz do a vid on The War of 1812
36:58 I'm not gonna lie, I thought it would be yet another advertisement for a mobile game where you can play and fight as any country in the world
This has to be the best one yet
Damn OverSimplified did so good making this video that he has 0 dislikes Pretty cool not gonna lie
I really like the ending
Cool
4:12 Workers: *Build a railroad* Settlers: *Give guns to the Natives* This mfer: *Starts building a freaking McDonald’s*
I can't help but to note a little anti-Canadian commentary at the end.      *but that's none of my business*
Will you make world war 3 when Putin dies from the war we're going to probably start
When the world needed him most, *He Returned!!!*
Yo yo calm the fuck down!
Let's invade Canada, we will be back home at Christmas!
great vid
HE HATH RETURNED!!!
This was it the video that made me sub!
funniest one yet
Nice todays my birthday
7:59 xD
But if we take Canada America becomes bald.
3:34 Oversimplified definitely knew what he was doing with that placement of Florida.
Pickett looks like Ian "Gun Jesus" McCollum
Do a video on texas history
best ending ever lol
You should also put subtitles in Spanish
37:12 thank me later
Wait what
OMG thank you! I've been waiting for so long to watch more of your videos.
HE BLACK
Blame Canada, blame Canada. All their beady little eyes and flapping heads so full of lies, blame Canada, blame Canada. Need to form a full assault, it’s Canada’s fault.
Right of conquest
Mrbeast: honey  Oversimplified: NORDVPN
2:21 I feel attacked
As long as there's no remaining british interests in the US - the last bit of cleanup is to deport James Corden.
The amount of work and detail that goes into these vidoes is astonishing.
Thought oversimplified was gonna drop the mixtape 8:00
The most magnificent, awesome and funniest video on this channel. Top notch animation too. You really throwed the house out the window! OverAWESOMENESS!!!
Finally after 6 months!!
Americans are so American
This is great especially with oversimplified's rant at the end made the video even more fantastic and funny!
Can you do  a video about romania?
Pov oversimplified finely uploaded 🤯🤯🤯🥳🥳🥳🤗🤗🤗
I will eagerly wait 6 months for the next video! Worth the wait for sure!
Me: living in Canada Alright, time to unsubscribe
Best. One. Ever.
the Canada rant at the end killed me
Pretty sure it Was Sharon's cat that got that prophecy from god to go West. Sounds more plausible.
return of an legend
Bangladesh liberation war should be in this channel
Man, I laughed waaaaay too hard at OverSimplified threatening the invasion of Canada.
Despite everything that happend let's just agree...  It was all OREGONS FAULT!!!! >:)
In 10 years when no one cares about any of this I’m showing my kids your channel
2022 :Biden ahhhhhh we got oil and maple syrup all in American Columbia
37:44Who noticed Saladin's eagle in the flagpole?
welcome back Oversimplified is a two part story on the way?
Ah yes, our king has returned.
Awesome
My village had a "war" with another village nearby some hundret years ago, which also was called "Schweinekrieg" (german for pigwar). But only one person died, I sadly dont remember the whole story anymore.
oh no our home its broken
33:20 I saw him at the door
New video! Finally! I've been waiting for ages 🐷
You should make posters with that thumbnail.
I feel harassed
What music was being played when the Americans were harassing Douglas.
BEST EPISODE YET! Voice-acting is topnotch.
wait soo there b2 bomber before even a plane was made noice
Could the next U.S. Canadian war be the war of OVERSIMPLIFIED?
as a canadian, the rant at the end was amazing
in Poland we had a civil war because of one cow
Dude next video shouting be on India's independence
Wait, the war of 1812 was because *we* invaded Canada??? not because the British thought it would be funny to burn down the White House??? Screw you Texas Edition History Textbooks! (ಠ ೧ ಠ)ᕗ
I thought for sure the ending was a sponsor transition to some mobile war strategy game and i'm so amused it wasn't
Babe, wake up! Oversimplified just posted!
Can you make a video on how Germany united
I always try to show my history teachers these so it isn’t such a boring ass class :,)
Oh so I'm on a watchlist
The ending tho
36:38
In tears laughing at the ending. These just get better and better
And that was all the Americans needed to inspire them to invade canada
the sponsor transitions on this channel are just the best.
Good to see you again OS
I get the commitment to light-heartedness...yet when discussing mass genocide...   It could come off as...distasteful...dgmw I've been subbed for years...I luv this shit!!   Perhaps it happened so gradual, I never caught on...
Wonder if North Koreans if they have phones can use Nord VPN
Wtf is that ending🤣
Pfff the Americans couldn't fight there way out of a pillow fort with Joe biden in office. Canada has nothing to worry about.
The amount of chaotic random screams and skits are abit too distracting in this one
Oversimplified is back!!!
Every time an OverSimplified video comes out, I inevitably do a rewatch of pretty much all his videos. During my rewatch, a thought struck: Would OverSimplified consider something along the lines of "The Kennedy Family Oversimplified"? I think he could tell the history of that cursed family very well in an oversimplified manner. But maybe I'm an idiot, which is well within the realm of possibilities.
Oversimplified:Exist  NordVPN: *Sup babygirl whatchu doin?*
how did i miss this
England gave america freedom they didnt win
Oh No! Oversimplified has been turned into a marketable plushie!
That seems like something Biden would do, or at least accidentally say...
oh dear, I have never heard oversimplified speak with anger
p i g
WHERE IS VIETNAM WAR
I often forget Canada is a country and not just America's backyard
Your crazy we have friends to
its like a christmas when this dude makes a video :)
And.....If you were wondering....  There must be at least a dozen cross border athletic competitions in the Pacific Northwest that are called  "The Pig War"  Hockey Curling Golf Soccer Orienteering Skiing Marksmanship  That I know of....
Stop it all please my America friend
OS has officially gone off the rails and I am here for it.
It's one thing to appear  "Savage"...  ...yet to commit, condone, and/or ignore acts of savagery... Forgiddaboudit..!!
HE IS BACK
1:01 Wait, who was in Paris?
soo I'm wondering, how long will it take for you to make a video of the Utah war
Make one about the french and indian war
The masculine urge to strap all 10 unnecessary guns onto my body and go single-handedly invade the entirety of Canada while they’re currently our friendliest ally in 2021 in the name of Manifest Destiny is real right now.
No one, and I mean no one has slicker transitions into video sponsors than OverSimplified
ENHAAAAAANCE
The balls of Americans to say they should occupy all of North America when Britain is clearly there too.  Not to mention Native Americans.
"Lyman, if you spare my life, I'll grant you three wishes."                                                               --Porky The Pig's last words probably
Wow. Me and General Harney have lots in common. Who knew
Fun fact: you are going to watch this video about people fighting over a pig and potatoes more than once.
Thought you died
Leeeetttttssss goooooo
s t r a i g h t  l i n e
Don't give Ted Cruz any ideas...
4:11 McDonald's :D      *I'm hungry now*
Thumbnails just keep getting better
Never thought I could spoil a youtube video to myself by looking up whose land the island is from google maps.
I’m in college now, but I can say that I’ve used your videos on multiple occasions throughout high school and college history papers. Need some info on WW2? Watch oversimplified for 20 minutes
Shut up, not all Americans are fat and have guns, that's only the south and the west.
Would be the best thing Brendan does during his term. Lets go!!
So the British had a war over some small islands thousands of kilometres from home which were home to a shit tonne of sheep? I feel like I've heard this before.
7:57 so smooth wtffff
i love u  😄
THIS NEEDS TO BE FIRST TREND!
Hell yeah as a American 🇺🇸 I would love to invade Canada but at the same time we are not as strong as we once were. America is dying so before we can invade Canada we need to figure out ourselves first.
I missed you
LFG
new vid
I swear i almost spit out my tea when I saw the end of this.  - I live on the Border. Proudly Canadian.
Next episode should be the Mexican American war
End of this video is epic!
the waiting was worth it
YEAH BABY
anyone see the Vietnam map on the table... bit of a Easter egg to a potential Vietnam war video
Can you do the Mexican-American war, Oversimplify?
OMG OMG OMG Yezzzz finally another oversimplified
uh oh I’m Canadian I am in trouble
Pig 🐖 BUT BLACK     racist kinda sus ngl
🇨🇦 Sleeping peacefully 🇺🇲 creeps up on canda stabs them NOW MAPLE SYRUP IS FINALLY OURS HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
Oversimplified, you good there at the end, mate??
Wow that was wird
Yeeeeeehawwwwww
Can you do the war of the roses next
Am I the only one to notice that at 7:57 he's referring to "Smash Mouth - All star" ?
the pig bro rip
Honestly, this is definitely your best video. Great humor, great story, wonderful especially considering how obscure it is!

Have you noticed the "density" at 3:38?
4:10 that’s so fucked up but true
ohh a new video :)
33:29 my dad everytime I break a glass:
18:40 anyone else think the pig was engaging in relations with the potato
YES YES YES NEE VIDDD
Ok, the last part falls for r/shitamericanssay
OH MY GOD FUCK YES THIS DAY IS AWSOME
That is a very accurate depiction of PMQs
didn’t think i would hear an all star reference in oversimplified lmao
Absolutely love these videos. It's genuinely entertaining 😆
See ya again in 6 months
Ah yes, I remember back in the day, a few centuries ago, when I was mowing down bison with a tommy gun and calling in air strikes on the bison with stealth bombers.
Make video on India's Independence
We want WW1 remastered! WW2 maybe.
Biden: Guess I have to invade Canada now.
9:10 what’s the name of the background song?
One of my fav ones
As a Washingtonian, this was in my state history course.
RIP spuddy and the pig……also the man goes full American at the end of the video, all I have to say to the Canadians is that he is living in your walls
Vietnam War Oversimplified?
Our favorite YouTuber is back yayyyyy! Also why are Canadians caring so much that he doesn't talk about Canada, it is just not really that relevant to the topic of the video
How about wild west
What if Oversimplified did a video on the great potato war? Just a thought.
I didn't say they were WHITE people 0:47
Manifest destiny northward?  What a great idea!  But why stop there?  Why not take all the land north of the Panama Canal?  And then reclaim out pacific holdings?  Invade and expand Liberia?  Reoccupy part of Germany?  We could even burn down Parliament as icing on the cake
Canadians  be like  "i am in danger"
31:05  IS THAT WILLIAM MORGAN SHEPPARD?
Now im sad, the shipping for the plushie costs 30$ 🥲 i quess ill be smaet and not waste my food money 🙃
You need to talk about Poland now.
Who else is stupid and thought the video was about bay of pigs?
Amazing and funny
Hey can you simplify Alaska for us?
As an English American I am very conflicted....
3:34 Florida lmao
I seem to remember there is an old comedy movie about the US trying to go to war with Canada because they have no one else to fight with. Anyone here know it's name ?
I never knew that Germany decided that ... lmao   So you telling a bunch of americans and Brits randomly come to the kaiser and are like   YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BIZMARK, MY MATE  Whos owns this ?  *Shows map* Bismark then unleashes all of his German Autism to transcend to the God Tier Logic Dimension to understand the issue to the fullest  BISMARK: ITZ ... ITZ ... ITZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ MMMMMMMMMMERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
In case you have no idea what to do next, there are julius ceasar conquests, if you want to help with school instead i suggest the 7 and the 30 years war
Canada 🇨🇦  # 1
THE TIME HAS COME
Well ..... That escalated really fast. 😂 Always love watching these vids.
Thank you oversimplifies for this great video. It really made my day
What did the Canadians do to you 💀
can you do a video of Julies Ceasar
I mean to be honest without the British Empire, not the modern British Army the actual Empire, Canada couldn't survive an invasion from Cuba
I was paying close attention until all the color changing on the islands gave me flashes of Sleeping Beauty’s dress 🧐
Broke: USA invading Canada to get more states WOKE: Canada invading USA to get 50 more provinces!
14:36  i m  d y i n g
Remember the time the US gave weapons to Iran and then secretly gave weapons to Iraq, and when Iraq invaded Iran, the US retaliated by carpet bombing civilians.   Also when the US gave 2 Billion USD to Al-Qaeda to fight against the Soviet Union during the Cold War?  Ah-Wah-Oh
31:35 the most unsettling thing about this pig is his ability to walk instead of sliding around on the ground all the time
You have to do the 30 years war!
This video (like all Oversimplified videos) has put smile on my face. You are amazing
Paused at 15:45 . Vietnam War is coming.
He jus wanted some bacon 🥓
Yo everyone, God just showed up in my dream and told me I should invade Canada!
Poor Porky  Forever the prettiest pigger of the ball
I saw the Shrek cover lol
Who paused the nord vpn ad to check the browsing history and the pop up ads 😂😂
WOW! What a speech at the end!!!
Honestly getting sick and tired of the stupid, childish, and cringey things Oversimplified is now doing. It was so much better about 2-3 years ago.
14:35
Can you remaster WW1?
"Woah woah woh..i didnt say they were WHITE people"  Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
The ending felt... different this time.
why you never talk about canada?
Oversimplified needs to do more bits like the Canada one at the end
what is the name of this track at the background plz 36:17
Juste magnifique !
Cascadian history
The thumbnail is a Starwars reference
This is THE BEST video Oversimplified has ever done, laughed so hard!
Yooo HBC The Northern Frontier
Seven years war aka the first global conflict would be cool to see your take on
His animation is getting better very fast, amazing video!
Am I the only person that thinks that the pig sounds like Morgan Freeman
Its really cool to see someone of note talk about PNW history
On behalf of my friends in Australia: the fuckin seppos are at it again.
The wait was very long
You literally are the best YouTuber I watch.
I thought oversimplified was Canadian 😂
That was the most quality ending I’ve ever seen
4:10 Lmao,
It wasn't until this video that I realized that the top of the US is just a damn straight line.
I never wanna see this guy
Loved the Papers please Reference
Strait line. strait line!
Seeing Wayne Gretzky draped in an Ameican flag is the most disgusting thing I've seen in the past year
Jizzingdham > fartigham FTW
I've been a big fan of the channel, but I wish it would go back to the original formula. Sometimes the history gets lost because the newer videos are too saturated with one liners and puns. The same goes for the Prohibiton video too. These weren't bad videos, just not as good as the older ones.
Sublime!
This man is a voice over, scripting writing, animation genius. Now if you'll excuse me its time to binge watch the entire series for the 6th time.
The ending though 😂😂😂
I love how he put a link at the end to the voice for the pig
Oversimplified: *uploads* Everyone: Dude… very cool!
@13:27 I nearly pissed myself!!
8:10 Great refference my friend
Legit Biden couldn't come if he wanted to but ya know alternate ending here: Trump would legit just buy Canada  Best Ending is that trump buys Canada and US invades and completleg give them our culture
@NikkoOrtiz, space force has a great great grandfather in this video
Ah, perfect video to watch after completing the assassin's Creed 3 DLC😁
yikers, I like your other content, but to compare white people to rats and disease because they invaded and spread across a continent? as a history buff you should well know white people are far from the first and far from the only to do this. So to single them out and to call them "like a disease" is racist and gross.
I've seen how Texans respond to 2cm of snow. I don't think we have anything to worry about.
Yes New Video THANK GOOD
The House of Commons doesn’t have Lords, and the House of Lords doesn’t have an active speaker in that way.
Can you do a Vietnam war video
Can we just take a moment to appreciate Oversimplified for such an amazing content. Give this man a cookie! 🍪
At 3:59 and I heard “I thought it was Sherman’s cat”   For context it was the person who spoke to god and and said that Americans should expand outwards
Where have you been!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.

Please can u do (kurdistan-iraq) for next video
The sponsor was smooth
Now the British people own the island
38:14 im in the U.S. side but i think biden forgot where the U.S. even is
NEW VIDEOOO
7:57 that all stars reference is BRILLIANT
I'm beginning to wonder if Governor Douglass or General Harney's parents beat them severely. I think there's a pattern here.
As a Canadian, this video is frustrating.
WERE INVADING CANADA BABY!
6:04 best advirtisment ever
Nooo. Don't conquer canada. I plan to move there before 2024 when the stupidest rematch in history splits america again.
U-S-EH?
Dheesh dis deservs coment
Based anti-imperialist Oversimplified
It’s pretty cool that the soldiers were chillin together
America invading Canada: weeee UN: hold it right there buster
America is too entitled lmao
men your face during this recroind fDAM
lol it was funny in the end
“Biden’s coming baby” Lhh
I'm british Oof
R.I.P for any1 watchin in public
you should really talk more about canada in your videos, man
Oh my god that ending 😂
Middle channel in the middle of the island
Just to be clear. If you burn down the other country’s government building… you won the war. That right Americans, you lost a war to us polar bear riding, maple syrup eating, hockey playing Canadians and you NEVER forget it.
“Woah woah woah… I didn’t say they were WHITE people” lmao very on brand
The Canada rant at the end is pure gold
I believe he should make a video about Indian subcontinent, he'll get that content for sure
16:01 is completely unrealistic. No self respecting American would ever use an AK-47
Sometimes I forget that this is teaching, and I just think that it is entertainment. Oh who I am I kidding, it is entertainment.
We got your back Canada! Greetings from the Netherlands😂🇳🇱❤🇨🇦
Imagine he replaced the Christian Americans with Muslims and called them rats. Fucking hypocrite channel
All I ask oversimplified could you not take 6 months to make another video
Anyone find all star in the middle of the video?
Another masterpiece.
The pastry war (between Mexico and France) would be a great topic for you to cover in miniwars
Since no one else did it that I saw: 33:29
Okay dude  The Vietnam war . The winter war  for  WAR OF SCOTTISH  Independence  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 which one would you pick 😎
I never thought I’d see oversimplified talk about my countries history especially war of 1812
2:30
I'm pretty sure the next video will be Vietnam because it certain scenes you can see a map with Vietnam on it it with the communist border
0:13 Sounds you need a girlfriend.
The funniest history video ever
_ALRIGHT YOU PSYCOPATH! I'VE WAITED _*_YEARS_*_ FOR THIS!!!_
i doubt biden will be coming, i mean, you can ask his wife if you want
Hi
Did this video get copyrighted?
Awesome job bro
Im a canadian and he put fear into my soul.
1 day and it's already 3.4 million views
Make a video about the Gilded Age and Progressive Era?
new oversimplified video
Damn, I loved this video. I understand now why it took so long to make. Could you do a video on Skanderbeg next? I know there is a probability of almost zero that you see this, but it would be cool.
Split it in half
Basically, the pig wars is just Angry Birds.
Please do the Mexican war oversimplified Kun
Can you make a episode on the Irish revolution?
COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET. IT WILL START OUT PROMISING ,BUT THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS IS THE BEAST SYSTEM.. THE DAY WILL COME THAT YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT THE MARK.. YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT IT. IF YOU TAKE YOU WITH REGRET IT WHEN GODS JUDGEMENT IS POURED OUT. YOU WILL BE THROWN DIRECTLY INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE FOR ALL ETERNITY. GOD LOVES YOU, GOD WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GOD IS JESUS CHRIST. ANSWER. JESUS CHRIST.
Europeans just wanted to make indigenous America more diverse, there were too many Indians and there was not enough multiculturalism, so they just spread the same message of love and cultural enrichment that is poisoning whitе nations across the globe.
Can you make a video on the Zanzibar war between the British and the sultan of Zanzibar the shortest war in history
Of course americans making a fuss on some islands. The UK isint any better but at least they wouldn't claim what's not theirs
can you make videos about uchronia, alternative stories. for example the universe of Kaiserreich or of falout? I would appreciate it very much.
At 18:23, youtube cc says "Yep, just a man *in* his potato."     hmmm
Speaking as a Canadian, I say bring it.  And by "it" I mean all those Americans that are too smart, rational, or decent to put up with the ongoing bullshit down there. Flee now, good people, the shit storm is coming.
7:50 All star Smash Mouth reference? Was I the first to catch upon that? Nice.
Dude cool also can the next war you talk about can be the winter war 😎
Like rats or disease 😂
12:24 And suddenly KSP VAB xD
Lmao bro ur videos make my day thank u
This is the most epic history lesson ever. Great job 👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻
37:20 impérialiste pigs
Oversimplied gives me a better education than school
As a Canadian the ending was very weird and I did sleep with one eye open just in case   Edit also drake is not American he’s Canadian
best ending of any oversimplified video so far
I love oregon glad it in the US
11:54 nice
what is the name of the music at 7:25
I need that last minute and a half liquified and injected into my veins in 2 initial doses and at least one booster determined at a later date.
Lol invading Canada
That's right Canada, watch out, we're co- Wait, what do you mean Biden forgot Canada is a country?
He is BACKKKKKKK
I'm disappointed there was no Bay of Pigs jokes
Hey, next time can you guys do an episode on the Reformation
You gotta know we are happy when there is new vid up
Yay oversimplified plush! Wait it’s limited edition? Never mind.
Lets invade Canada
I needed this. Tnx:)
good video
Would love to see a italy reunification video/s
Sadly, Oversimplified doesn’t do the “dude, uncool” anymore
Who knew WW3 would've started because of a YouTube video....General OverSimplified. Lol
very goo vid as allways. but i waited soo long for a vid and i got a vid of the pig wars. no offence but there are a lot more important wars and battles than this. good work tho
Lmao Biden is signing everything without reading and caring about it, just give him the paper and we can make a centuries long dream finally come true😂😂👌
32:07 I love how Gen. Scott's face looks like he's angry and fed up with everyone's lack of basic common sense
this is your best video yet by a lot  please upload more videos like this LOL
rude 37:20
to all the Canadians in the crowd, that wasn't a joke
The President Drake part absolutely killed me
Best episode with the best jokes. I give this episode... the woody award.
America is losing its power to China if there’s going to be a war against Canada it’s gonna be with a Chinese
I love how he said liiiiike this video for the nordvpn ad. Reffering to the video being blocked in Germany lol
*yes oversimplified. Let's begin WW3.*    *this means more oversimplified content.*
FINALLY YOU POSTED AGAIN
Why did we stop expanding? Why didn't we take canada and mexico? It feels like our collection is incomplete.
38:19 My fellow Americans :,, Don't do Drugs"
Bring back old style videos
37:18 Oversimplified went full Murican
Controversial take: I don't like these new Oversimplified videos. I still enjoy them, but they aren't what they used to be. My biggest gripe is that these new videos just have jokes that just fall flat, they feel forced. Of course some of them are quite funny (the ending of this video), but 90% just feel like they shouldn't be there. I still absolutely love this channel and want to see it grow even more, but I don't want these videos to become annoying to watch because of the over saturation of jokes. I think a little bit more of a serious tone would make this videos as enjoyable as some of the older ones.
Is nobody going to comment about the unclosed <audio> tag on the isitasoup page?
hey, can you do the greek revolution of 1821 for the next video? most likely it will be a no
One of the greatest, maybe the greatest YouTube video I’ve ever watched.
The scene in the Commons at 10:20 gave me my first belly laugh in days! I cant tell you how much I love your videos.
Worth the wait
That one scene where there was a mino Cooper and a mustang was pretty clever
omg i lost it at that ending hahahahahhahahahahaha i literally spit my salmon salad hahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 10/10 the comedy was top knotch hard to top the Napoleon series but this one omgooodnes man
Kinda funny how Drake’s the president that ends Canada even though he’s from Canada
20:57 as i french i can say, it's a great man
At least you agree that America is the craziest country in the world
I love how youtube doesn't even show unavailable videos. I just got to know that there are videos about that artist guy with a silly mustache.
9:19 "Northern Irish men love me!"
Babe wake up OverSimplified posted
What the
was the pig voiced by morgan freeman?????
Welcome
that wouldn't happen in a people's republic
OOOOOoooOOOOooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow, he got a little unhinged at the end there, lol.
37:08 "And so it ends" "No, so it begins"
27:26 I laughed so hard I can't even
Kinda strange how there names are harney and hornby kinda sus tho
Return of the king!   I’ve been waiting
Comrade oversimplified, you should consider going to Hollywood, you make masterpieces.
1:53 the amount of details in a scene of 3 seconds… amazing!      Btw, why is there a TV?..
ze thumbnale is a masterpiece just like the video
37:15  ... ...  I did.... Not expect that....
i came in expecting either something like the war of the bucket where a bunch of people went to war over a pig or something like the emu war where a bunch of pigs just ruin some peoples day so long they call in the military. didnt get either one, still not disappointed
didnt get about Biden :)
b-but im in canada
Hmmm am I the only one who noticed that the Eagle on the American flag pole is the Eagle of Saladin? Seems they stole that too.
Most screen time Canada has ever received on yt
It would be impossible for the US to invade Canada as the Canadians know the terrain and can survive the cold as well as other commonwealth countries would come to aid as well as the UK firing nukes at New York, Washington, Boston, Orlando and LA as you can see it is impossible for the Us to invade Canada
🤩
30:38 so... Oversimplified....  You good my man ?
There is an alternate universe where an actual war was fought over this pig
Most American ending!
These days war is begun just by talking about how great President Trump was and how much better President Biden is doing.
im scared now.... dont hit Newfoundland please all we have is st johns :) (NL is cool tho ngl)
Next is Vietnam war?
f........
Yes love your vids
I would say that the line that was disputed over the islands, and the whole cause of the near war, should have went straight down the middle channel.  Makes things even between the US and UK.
What a video
Another Video, I been waiting man great job any chance you can do the Iraqi war?
Maos war on sparrow but in American with pigs
5:56priceless perfectly cut swear
1369 nice :)))))
Sometimes I wish canada had control over Washington state
i want a oversimplified body pillow! not plushie
Denmark is POG
I remember when hey arnold made an episode about the pig war, i thought it was just a plot point until i got older. Fucking crazy
Ah yes, pigs
Shout out to everyone, whose level-headedness has prevented nuclear wars and wars in general. <3
no oversimplified nooo don't invade canada
This channel is too good⭐️🔥💯
All of this over a pig!
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDIEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! -my actual reaction
im the 30,000 comment yay
Canadian history eh? Okay sure. I didn't know canada was real.
0:41 that "Oh no!" hits different.
Canada isnt real.
14:29 classic calculator joke
This is by far the Best Oversimplified video yet
Korean War, Vietnam War, or Communist Cambodia please.
Canadians be sweating after that ending 😂😂. 38:08 Every night, they're gonna be like "One eye open when I'm sleeping.... One ÆÆÆÆÆ"
If Oversimplified actually rallied a war to invade Canada all I hear is  a man yelling "HOLD BROTHERS FOR CANADA FOR OUR HOME"
I love seeing my hometown on this map!
All jokes aside I’ve always found that all of North American, meaning Canada and Mexico should be annexed by the U.S.
He’s officially lost his damn mind and it’s glorious.
Blame Canada
USA USA USA!!!!
3:36 America be looking a little sus
Oversimplified: We are going to march through the Streets of Montreal very soon!!!! Yeeehaw!!   Canada: Straight Lines??  USA: Straight Lines. 🤣🤣
what happened with the veitnam war
very simplified and funny. nice job
3:36 what Florida doin tho 😳
Canada look at what you guys started, this man just unleashed the beast within
dude not cool🇵🇱
After ten thousand years of waiting.....
7:59-8:01 am I the one that caught that?😂
That ending wtf
Bestie you don’t need a vpn to binge every single BTS video of all time I know from experience :D
WH Aide: "Woah woah woah... I didn't say they were *white* people."  French Lousiana: "Quoi???!!!"  That's right, France... you ain't white!
Guys he uploaded
Yessssss!!!
The one and only God, who is Holy, made us in his image to know him. But we sinned and cut ourselves off from him. In his great love, God became a man in Jesus, lived a perfect life, and died on the cross, taking on himself the punishment for the sins of all those who would ever turn and trust in him. He rose again from the dead, showing that God accepted Christ’s sacrifice and that God’s wrath against us had been exhausted. He now calls us to repent of our sins and to trust in Christ alone for our forgiveness. If we repent of our sins and trust in Christ, we are born again into a new life, an eternal life with God.
Hahahaha
Bruh why isnt canada in your vidio !111!!!1??? 😡😡
The "white people" joke was stupid... not you, Oversimplified, not you...
So America always sucked?
31:00 this made me die laughing 😂
the last bit was gold
Hey oversimplified can you make a video about owain glyndwr the last Prince of wales the dude who tried to free the Welsh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 From the english?
37:17
As a Canadian, you are scaring me now, Mr. Simplified…
Hey, he's talking about the general area I live! Not on the islands of course, that's expensive.
This was awesome! I live just a short ferry boat ride away from the San Juan's and never knew this history of the area. Thanks!
Irish history should be next!
The king is back  !
Straight Line? Straight Line.
Did you that OverSimplified was one of the few people in America that still supports Biden? Btw he’s also Canadian
Unbelievable how good your videos are. The sad part? Waiting for the next...
Do a video on the Chinese Civil War
WATCH OUT CANADA , USA! USA! USA! 🔫🇺🇸💣💥
After Canada Re-Elected a man, TWICE, who donned Black Face so many times he "can't recall" how many times he did it, I'm glad those racist fucks aren't part of us.  I wish we would wall off Canada and open our Southern Border, instead of doing the opposite.  Edit - No, just no, do NOT propose we invade, I DO NOT want that racist, gamer hating country within our borders.
37:12 please don’t
hello i have contacted the intercommunicational intercorparation international islamist goverment and they say you don't talk about the middle east, ending was epik tho
Biden’s not the president tho
That ending... So beautiful... So uhuhuhu
Otherwise known as the technoblade war
14:05
It’s funny I was thinking yesterday, there should be a new OverSimplified video. My prayers have been answered 😁
Amazing to see two great countries arguing like children over insignificant territory.
I'm canadian and I feel so attacked
Could you please make a video about the Sonderbundskrieg?
The best history channel on YouTube hands down. I know you aren't the most in depth channel which provides all the nitty gritty details but that's the whole point of having it simplified. You go a great job making history both humourous and entertaining with your quality scripts and animations.
he came back when we needed him the most
Does Biden even know where Canada is...?
HE LIVES
Why the Germans though?
This War is canon in My DnD Campaign World now. With slight name changes, of course😅
Bruh. Are you okay?
This video makes you wonder who the Savages really are.
Am are uruguayan of south amerixa
He’s so american that he pumps a double barrel shotgun lol
Bahahahaaa loved the ending hahahaa... I'm Canadian and i love your chanel, keep up the great work!!!!!!!
now a half a year to next video
Best Episode ever
I was missing u😒
poo jokes suck
Such an underrated channel
100 years your great grandchild will make these videos and one will be called the video war (how America took over Canada with a phsyco president because of a video LOL)  jk great video
A plushie... meh, we need a oversimplified body pillow!
in ww1 and ww2 you forget Poland-_-
You should do Balkan wars
Please make a video on Alexander the Great of Macedonia
14:34 back then money was more valuable
The animation for this video was great! So many little additions that add personality. And also the yelling is actually yelling, not muffled whisper screaming which is way better
After watching that ending is anyone gonna check to make sure OverSimplified is okay?
Huh... and here I was thinking that the Falklands was the first war Britain started over little, stupid islands
The thing Biden is doing, Sus
OMMGGG NICEE
no more swearing plz
BIDEN IS COMING WITH A VENGENCE!!
Yesss Connect Alaska to the rest of us.
So worth the wait. Love your videos!
The ending made me patriotic for America when I am an Indian
Tbh the Canadian military would spend the whole war apologizing for being there
i literally thought that this was gonna be about on side illegally taking more pigs than in a deal, not about an actual piggy
I interpret that last bit as a declaration of war
As a great man once said about Canada: "They've had it too good for too long"
The end, I'm crying.
19:10 looks like valteri bottas!
do vietnam war PLS
James Douglas be like:  7:25: Ah, what a beautiful corner in british territo- NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! 16:17:Shut up! If the americans hear about this our land will be infested with them!... oh no... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
26:27 I understood that reference
Dude this is amazing.
this man will not rest until his videos aren't blocked in certain countries, also keep up with the sponsor transitions
Really good, but a little bit less jokes would have make the video clearer
He might be onto something with the whole Drake for president thing
I'd be alright if I never heard Whoopty Goldberg talk again.
17:54
Take my like sir.. TAKE IT!
Idk I'd canada burned the pink palace and the white house I'd say they won
It's crazy how the Hudsons bay company is now a mall department store.
MA MA MAAAA GET THE CAMERA, OVERSIMPLIFIED DROPPED NEW WORLD LORE
15:40 I suddenly have the urge to play Kerbal Space Program.
Actually, for real, we SHOULD invade Canada.  Those folks have had it too good for too long.
That was quite the ending
i felt so patriotic and ready for war  at the end
And thats how the us-canadian war started
Nice upload schedual
The way Yank was said here 5:37 gave off a lot of pressure
Biden is the type of person to lose a war to Canada, I mean he already lost an entire war spanning 20 years to a remote tribe in Afghanistan who can't even locate their own country on the globe.
HE’S BAAAAACK
“It’s my density!”
Anyone notice that that pig is Waddles from Gravity Falls?
that ending screams america
That ending though!!!!
33:15
I know you wont see this but can you do a video on the turbot war?
32:31 Al Pacino's previous birth lol "You are an indiot, You are an idiot ..."
Erhm, I think oversimplified just declared war on the Canadians...
Honestly, it sounds more like you want America to become Canada than have America invade Canada.
To be honest, the ending was the most american thing I've ever seen on youtube.
I like the thumbnail, and is cool! Good star wars parody lol!
america is one of the best in the world but  the national debt might cause the disrupture of the us AND CAN BE A 3RD CHANCE TO REAWAKEN THE MEXICAN EMPIRE (yes im being nationalist to my country)
"Unrelenting negative outlook on life that affects everyone" yup, he's British. Any Brit would agree. Forget the posh voices, misery and pompous resentment of everything IS British culture.
Do I......Do I want to invade Canada now?
Ghad Dammit man stand down!
Thank god you have a new video. 6 month wait for the next one?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! I have been waiting FOREVER for more oversimplified. It's how I learn history. I have a test due!
Drake for president.
Me and my Canadian friend watched this together. We have been watching out backs ever since...
YAAAAYYYY it is back
Awesome vid you should do one on Reconstruction
If this information format only existed when I was in school, I would have looked forward to "studying". lol
Oversimplifies is not just an American he's a freedom loving Patriot.
OMG 31:00 I genuinely spat my water out, I used to think that only happened in movies. Dying.
This channel is a true gem!!!!!
the ending was great i am very happy
29:11 Oh Holy Jesus I Nearly Died.
That ending was EPIC!!!
Nice job getting 7 on trending
My man you just became a legend
Given the fact that Biden has dementia, he probably would invade Canada.
he's back. wohoooooo
I cannot overSTATE this enough! your videos are LEGENDARY!!
where u been man
Shoutout to Steamy McSteamface :-)
Lol at the end. You have nukes, but we have Canada geese. Don't mess with our cobra chickens lol.
Shhh don't say the British burnt down the White house! You'll make the Canadians sad. Let them have this little victory.
Hello friend, good luck with the invasion! And make sure to watch out for Scott, he’s a dick.
Ok, that ending was kinda worrying
Okay okay the "Drake is president" got me 🤣
33:28 may be my favourite moment of the episode minus the ending
You are the best
I would love Banff as our national park!
37:19 I'm scared
😂 33:22
made my day...thx
Probably your best vidoe yet, and these videos are AMAZING!!
Invading Canada would be stupid and a massive waste of tax payer money in an already ongoing crisis situation. We would have very little to gain. Slightly more than annexing Mexico, Cuber or idk Haiti but still not much. I know it's a final zinger joke, but still, I'm just saying. Besides, we are out of the colonizing business, and more into the pupating countries we need resources from business. lol
ITS BEEN 6 MONTHS WHERE WERE U
Finally another video guess oversimplified finished hibernation
LYMAN, IF YOU SPARE MY LIFE  I'LL GRANT YOU THREE WISHES...
A PIG shot means war
OMG christmas is here
he is back
The amount of information, quality and humor👌. I love it!
The return of the king
Hieho
Now it really IS a better place 😃👍
Please can you do a more in-depth video of ww1
Finally a topic I’ve been wanting to hear. A war that didn’t happen
As someone who's been to these islands about a kajillion times and been to the historical sites, I can confirm that this is entirely accurate
Best one yet.
Talk about greece
Talk about greece
Now I guess canadians will try not to be talked about anymore in any of Oversimplified videos... My god you went total crazy lol
Talk about greece
The guy is crazy
I’m so glad we got to keep the San Juan islands
that ending was scary omg i dont think i can sleep w/out my teddybear omg my teddybear made in usa omg spy????? usa spies are everywhere
LETS GO!!! MORE OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!
I didn't know that this was a part of Canadian history. This should really be taught in schools.
Great Video, but why did they make Germany decide?
Not the first time biden might be coming on canadians.
I love your Videos man!
I can sense genuine anger during the end
I fill like I've seen a photo of Pickett when they show pictures of Civil War generals.
cocks double barrel shotgun
Oh Biden is coming alright.... as soon as he can find Canada on a map that is.
At least he Mentioned Romania one Time
This guy needs to make shorter videos here & there
Very nice improvement on voice acting skills, good job!
Collaborate with Historia Civilis
Maybe next you could do the opium wars, but only if you want to
The ending was absolute gold! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wife: My water just broke. Me: Oversimplified posted a new video. Wife: Me: Wife: I can hold it.
This is one of the greatest video's of all time and the ending was amazingggg
I SWEAR I CANT BELIEVE THIS OMG I CANT BELIEVE HE FINALLY POSTED A VIDEO AFTER HARD WORK HE MADE A VIDEO CONGRATULATIONS OMG OMG OMG I CANT BELIEVE THIS UR VIDS ARE SO GOOD
hilarious !
Best. Ending. Ever.
3:45 That's what she said
Let's GO, Brandon!
Did you guys know Canada has half the worlds fresh water? And with Southwestern states experiencing droughts for several years now.. Just sayin..
This video is just genius
Sometimes I'm scared of American Patriotism
After a hard day at work, this was just the right amount of learning comedy i needed! Hats off to the whole team!
9:29
...I didnt said they are white people.  *Golden*
Should this not be correctly called The Pig and Bird War?  Oh, wait, I was thinking about Angry Birds...my mistake.
In our time, a guy like Harney would've actually became president.
I…. LOVE…. THIS…. MAN!!!!😂💜
14:28 - does the calculator say "BOOBEZ" upside down?
This is The most American thing ever
probabaly the best ending to a video ever
To be honest, that pig was so magic it could have actually made the phrase 'when pigs fly' true.
The potatoe has sonic shoes lol
14:29 There's something sketchy with that calculator...
14:29
You still upload?
Can you talk about Scotland?
I liked the video even before watching it 😂
I'm a simple man: I see a new Oversimplified video - I watch it 20 times in a row.
"Cause Biden's coming baby, But this time...WITH A VENGENCE!!!--- right after he's done with his nappy nap." XD
.
I wish we get to see the 2 British and American cartographers again in future videos, they seems like friends but have seperate personalities
And 0 dislikes, shout-out to another masterpiece
Nordppn
I don't know why but these guys keep making these videos better and better. Perhaps they can do the Mexican-American war next, or maybe do a video on other famous leaders, like Constantine the great for example.
Has his voice changed ?
this makes me think of that episode of hey arnoldXD
ah yes
Still would get hard if you do roman empire oversimplified
The first time in history that the British didnt care about islands in the pacific
what you think when you think about USA norhtamericans: FREEDOOM  all the other countries in America: 3:41
YES ANOTHER VIDEO
winter war when
Woe woe woe I didn't say that they were white people 😄   The irony of "our" founding fathers.  You guys rock!
The fact how this guy is still good.
"...but the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming  hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running."
This is the FUNNIEST Oversimplified I've ever watched and I learned alot
"like rats or disease"    i can take that.
Could you do a video on the whiskey rebellion of 1791-1794?
I'm not even American and the ending made me want to raise the American flag
Hi
Bidens coming to sniff those Canadian kids.
What do you wana say to joe Bryan right now.. sup baby let’s invade Canada
Best fucking ending ever. Reminds me of Unraveled with BDG's legendary meltdowns.
America would lose a war with canada purely to do with canada's allies and other diplomacy related things
epic! and  I feel like I work with these people :(
Did not even watch but I know it is going to be lite 🔥🔥🔥 and I am subed to from I am going to watch just want you to know I respect and admire to the work you in for fans 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
The ending was the most american thing ever
That ending showed a dark side of this chanel 👀
india perhaps?
This is probably the greatest video on YouTube
i see nothing wrong with manifest destiny, as americans we should control the entire continent, as we are the only country that matters even a little bit. Also love the ending, i would absolutely support the invasion of Canada, but why stop there why not Mexico and south America as well.
Did…. Did he just…. declared war on Canada?
As a Brazilian, I thought the ending was hilarious.
I've heard this voice on another channel 😆
This video was worth the 6 month wait
the ending is the best part of the video ngl
Can you do bosnian war? Thanks!
15:50 Vietnam map on the table O_O
the last part tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice Allstar incorporation in the script sir. Bravo (Slow Claps)
Is erm, oversimplified ok? The ending makes me think he might have been indoors a bit too long.
And here is the next reason why I hate America
How about something on India next time?
It was quite a novel experience to see an oversimplified video where i actually did not already know how it was going to end. I mean who ended up with the island, not the canada...thing.
See you in 6 months!
Lets go New video your the best
I don’t understand why Americans think the war of 1812 was a draw, or even more misguided, a win for the USA. Wars are considered victorious based on goals. The American goal was to invade Canada and remove British rule from their next door due to paranoia. Canada’s (or the British colonies) goal was to prevent that from happening on the invasion defence. Britain accomplished it’s goal. America did not. America lost the war and were forced to sign a treaty, but still think they won by claiming their goal was to avoid becoming British rule, which was only said after the war ended. It’s like a little brother claiming they won a lost game by getting the least amount of points in ping pong.
O.O
What's the name of the song 7:25?
My god - this is amazing, you have pulled this out the bag!
yoo new vid
oh, I know this one, its the one with the red birds that slingshot!
Before the pig The Pig Military escalation.
This is so fucking funny
so america was the bad guy, blamed the other guy, and got what they wanted in the end?   yeah sounds about right
Poor cansdians, luckily im dutch
Drake for president
Canada exists Oversimplified: I won't forget about you if I own you.
Can you make a video about the balkan wars?
If you think about it how powerful America was in the first 50 years of their existence. Take Argentina for example, the Falkland War was basically over the same dispute about who owned the island. Great Britain despite modern tech, traveled over 8,000 miles to claim occupation. With San Juan Island the British conceded with out war. Shows you how fast America became so powerful that Britain didn't want another conflict like the American Revolution and the War of 1812.
Finally heard Oversimplified crazy shouting voice
I watched this 4 times since release
Without a doubt the best youtube channel of all time.
1916 Easter rising plz
Simply's declaration of invasion on Canada was the most active I've ever heard his voice. Like, his explanation voice, his character voice, and that voice are at different levels of intensity. That was awesome!
What the f happend at the end?  That was more aggressiv them me talking about the austrians. We still will come for you. Maybe not under Olaf, maybe not under the next chancellor, but we will come for you!
Thanks so much for coming back! I've just been yelled at for 3 minutes and told they don't want to see me. But this made me feel better, so thanks. :)
7:15 you got what?
Wake up babe, new OverSimplified just dropped.
Best ending I've ever seen in my life. No movie top that
Bucket war: the sequel
Yes
We are fans of OverSImplified and we just bought the OverSimplified Plushy!
This whole video was just a not so subtle way to announce the American invasion of 2022.  Sleep with one eye open Canada.
7:58 🔥
just put my canadian citizenship application on hold
Bro why are you telling the Canadians our plans for 2022. That shit was supposed to be a secret
So the british all this time were really just NordVPN!?
just remember people, VPNs do absolutely *nothing* to protect your online privacy!
No one:  Literally No one:  UK: We could absolutely destroy America and have an unbelievable economy but let’s not do that in favour of trading with them
Back so soon?
I hate patriotism. But I love oversimplified.
This video makes me proud to be an American
Hi
I can’t express how much better my days are made whenever you upload! Thank you so much Oversimplified!
love how you talk mad shit about us expansion but not a second you spend on hudson bay co monopoly and horrible treatment of natives. and that took all of twelve seconds to double check.
I thought this was gonna evolve into a double sponsorship and end like: "You want to invade Canada? Sign up on [grand-strategy game] and make these dreams come true"
Bring it oversimplified we burned the white house once AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN (say it in an albertan accent)
I have waited for so long…
4:10
*_Im not even American and the ending made me feel patriotic_*
Ok now do india
OMG what an amazing comeback this video is absolutely hilarious nice seeing a new video
Imagine Canada going to war with the United States over an Oversimplified video
I had the biggest patriotic hardon at the end! USA! USA! USA!
Thank you for pronouncing "Oregon" correctly. There's no GAWN in OREGON.
Just to let you know, in public school I learned that we won the war of 1812. Not a draw.
This went from 0-100 real real quick
I'm telling the British
Irish history mext
i say the islands were britsh cuz they sent some one first
Woah woah woah...I didn’t say they were white people😂😂😂
ok now hear me out.. vietnam war next. pls do it
ok
The ending alone is enough to make want to just erase the line between Canada and the U.S.
Not enough people mention the utter hilarity of the bison yeeting into the cosmos from being bombed. Just me?
Next war should be the Chinese civil war
No uncool part…    Uncool
can you do vietnam war or anything cool?
Oh shit, here we go again
Now time to wait another few months
We all waited 6 months for a video and we finally got one
Next up swden
yeeey OverSimplified you are back!!!
I died when the sheep called dude a nut job 😂💯😂😂
_And I am proud to be an American, where I can sulk end-less-ly_
Sounds like a great idea😈
This is amazing
But... Did the Americans ever pay the 100$ for the pig?  Or does the American government still owe the Canadians/Britains 100$ + inflation?
oversimplifed be like: 99.99% random stuff 0.01% other stuff
i always first like the video and then watch it cuz i know it will be good !
Pigs is bacon
That ending.. didn't see it coming..
This maybe will sound quite fussy, but the way to describe the border between Mexico and Texas and the border between Mexico and United States prior to the war between the two nations is not accurate, I think there are better ways to portray the land in dispute than giving it all to the United States (since in any case, that land was controlled by Mexico and the Native Americans, not by the Americans) Although well, the fact that the author is American explains why he put the borders like that lol
Fallout universe: **USA invades and annexes Canada in 2072** Oversimplified: okay but what if 2022?
Seeing Vancouver island in an Oversimplified video made me happier than it should have
over 3 million views and no one dislike it
37:07 Shit went from 1 to 100 real quick !
Being half Canadian and half American I approve of the ending
when I first read the title I read it as "the big war" haha
I'd like to find out how the border at Niagara Falls was settled.  The Americans lost that one I think.  Canadians have an amazing view of both falls (Horseshoe and American falls).
Loved the ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Coming from a Washingtonian, it was nice to watch a video focused on PNW history
This one was a bit extra funny
In like 40 years, imagine hearing about a random youtuber who jut talks about history invading and either taking over, or losing to canada. Omg thatd be HILARIOUS
7:57 that was beautiful
I thought that ending was an intro to the next war that has been … turns out it’s an intro to the war that WILL BE
Man that was good. I didn't even realize I was learning something.
Canada still has a battle like this with the Netherlands and instead of killing each other, they just replace the flag with theirs and leave a bottle of alcohol for the people who have to replace it next as a nice gesture
Most legendary ending ever🤣🤣
Vietnam war when ?
Got that plushie 👀 I want it all, wish you guys had something that said “bro, uncool” ⚡️🔥 that would have been great 😂
Dude this vids quality was exceptional by far. Yeah, your other vids are amazing too but you added a lot of oomph in this one. The sound quality, the effects, the humor, the storytelling, everything was top notch as always. I don't know what it was but you seemed super excited voicing this too and it made it so much funnier. Keep it up bro. I've never missed one yet and I definitely don't plan on it anytime soon.
Oversimplified : want to take canada  Canada:se vuoi puoi prenderti il quebeck we hate that people Oversimplified :i did bot expected that but ok
Now I want the Emu war
I waited six months for this kinda worth it
We all know the US could never successfully invade Canada with Biden in office. He's too limp-wristed.  We need a man with an iron fist. A man that won't back down from a fight. A man that will go up to Prime Minister Trudeau and tell him to suck Eagle turds without cracking a smile. We need...........   George Washington's ghost
This channel is like drugs, after not having it for a bit you'll start to want it more and more, and when it hits, it makes you incredibly happy
Definitely worth the wait!!! His video keep getting better and better.
Can we just talk about that ending for a minute?
Wtf was that ending I love it so much.
hands down one of the best outros to a video I've come across
Fun fact: hornby later became rear admiral and later on admiral of the fleet, and at one point entertained President Grant at Gibraltar
Kinda inspired to invade Canada now and I'm not even American 😂
He is being extremely biased but it’s so funny so I really don’t give a shit. Bu
You could do a poll to see what people want to see next
pettiton for over simplefied to make Vietnam war (wayyy overdoo) and Maybe India's first war of independence/Mutiny of 1857
Good work
Bruh I not even American and at the end I felt so patriotic to America lol  Awesome video Oversimplified
7:59 my god this is genius!
If only history in school would be sponsored by Nord VPN
I watch your videos for actual answer writing purpose so Please also cover concert of Europe and ancient Indian Empire and independence fight of India.....  ಥ‿ಥ
You should do the Irish rebellion!🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
WHEN NEW VIDEO?
Whos for vietnam war next???
6 months of winter and can go alllll the way down to -40 degree celcius. I think invading Canada in Winter must be next to Invading Russia in Winter 😂
THE BEST ENDING EVERRR !!!!!!!!!!!!
Yay oversimplified is back :) and nothing has changed! (In the good way).
Epik
I'm not even american,don't even like history,but bruhh,this is interesting
Ahahahahahhaa the ending 💀💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🥴🥴 so American 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂
In this video we went from shooting pigs and almost causing a war to annexing Canada and installing drake as president.  If that’s not the most American thing I have seen this year, I don’t know what is 😂
hadn't heard of this conflict in a while not since Hey Arnold
this video has 50% less dislikes than normaly
You'll get a hockey puck right in your nads sir. Sorry.
THAT’S RIGHT CANUCKS! BIDEN’S COMING, AND HE’S BRINGING TRUEINANABABADASHABADAPRUSSIA!!!!
You should do the irish revolution (1916 Easter rising)
DAY 3 OF REQUESTING VIETNAM WAR
Many centuries from now, historians will cite this video as the primary cause of the brutal Canadian-American War.  And so history will repeat itself, with a video about a stupid war ironically causing a stupid war.
HELLO!!
This will age very poorly, quote me in 2048 bitches
The ending/Canadian rant is one of the best things I've ever seen on YouTube. Well played sir, well played!
Bring more videos please atleast 1 per week
Please make the 30 years War! I live in a town of the peace of that war. I would really love to see that :)
I thought this like to be something like Emu War, like fighting agaisnt pigs
When the world needed the most he came back
Your best one yet. Peak everything, especially the voice acting. You just keep getting better 👌
I like how the climax pretty much happens at the EXACT midpoint.
I am so scary that I am sleeping with one eye
"A blessing from the lord"
Glad I’m not the only one calling for the return of manifest destiny lol
I love your content!! It’s awesome. Stay safe everyone ❤️💛❤️
Do Yugoslav Wars please!!!
This is kind of like the Rockall Bank dispute, a TINY uninhabited island that the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Iceland ALL claim to be theres. One country will say one of their own found it first, another will put a plague on it saying its theirs, another will tear off and put up their flag, another will tear that flag down and put up their own plague, another will claim rights to the water around it or fishing rights. Its a lot of back and forth, all over a tiny rock that has no material value and is too small to support any people living on it.
Was that Morgan fucking Freeman?
I simp for OverSIMPlified
HOW DID I MISS THIS STREAM?! I LOVE PIGS AND OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!
ok, somebodyoncetoldme reference was brilliant
This was really good
There wasnt a single dude uncool moment in this video......Dude,Uncool
I love these videos !!!!!
I hear voices all the time
I hope you haven’t peaked - how do you top that ending!?!? 🥳😱🥳
How much I love this part lol 30:41
3:44 sound alot like Israel
I know this topic has been done before on YouTube but have you considered doing a video on Admiral Yi? I feel like the absurdity of some of the obstacles he faced would be absolutely hilarious when described in your style.
Lol 3:43 Why does the rat have a combat shotgun from Fallout 4 clutched in its teeny tiny paws?
maga losers are on that copium lol
Missed this man so fricking much
Yes we can complete the C. U. M zone (Canada USA and Mexico)
Had me in the first half as soon as you mentioned Biden I was like nope.
Let's wait for a competent president before we worry about invading Canada.
From 37:20  *WHY YOU LITTLE*
Porky was the original harambe
OverSimplified, you’ve done it again!
I had to literally rewind to see the change at 27:27 in the map…. That itself shows the absurdity😂
#10 on trending. nice
"Lyman, if you spare my life I'll give you 3 wish-"
Best part of the video was the McDonalds getting slapped down in the background.
IDEA: Do the mongolian empire
A legend has come back...
I can’t sleep
36:57 for the legendary ending
The pig is for _sure_ in the top ten anime deaths of all time
Waiting for 100 war
🤨the ending
Be back in 6 months
Really thought American and Britain were friends straight away after the war of independence
Lord Jesus, for too long I’ve kept you out of my life. I know that I am a sinner and that I cannot save myself. No longer will I close the door when I hear you knocking. By faith I gratefully receive your gift of salvation. I am ready to trust you as my Lord and Savior. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for coming to earth. I believe you are the Son of God who died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead on the third day. Thank you for bearing my sins and giving me the gift of eternal life. I believe your words are true. Come into my heart, Lord Jesus, and be my Savior. Amen.   If you've read this and prayed the prayer and meant it you are saved and have begun a beautiful relationship with the lord. Please continue to read the Bible and reach out for the lord. You have come across this message for a reason. I pray that you always be blessed and have a wonderful relationship with the lord. God bless.
YEEEEEESSSSSSS
Didn't he get a little excited at the end ? Lol
That was an amazing 40 minutes of content
LETS GOOO
The best ending ever but amarica should never invade Canada
This is just a slow spiral into insanity
Pig Wars:  The Pignom Menace Attack of the Pigs Revenge of the Humans A new Pig The Humans Strike Back Return of the Pig The Animal awakens The Last Pig The Rise Of Pig
John 3:16-21 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
The Hudson’s bay company still exists today
talk more about Canada in your videos!
Can you please make a video about the Mexican-USA war that you mentioned in this video. Thanks
Love the channel! Buuuut….. in school in Canada we’re taught that Canada and Britain won the war of 1812 and I’m gonna have to go ahead and agree because I mean Canada is still Canada.
bruh, Why. Why invade Canada?
It's number 9 on trending
3:34 y'all Florida looks like America's p*nis 😭
next russian civil war plz
u don't talk enough about swizerland
Lmao when will the Vietnam one come
33:15
Do the Irish war of independence that and 1916 had more drama than a the kardasians
30:15
Ah yes, the most American weapon: the Kalashnikov AK-47
The fact that we got a one shot documentary means that a two parts long documentary is on the way. AND I LOVE IT
Hey OverSimplified, great video as always! Never heard of this before, so it´s always nice to learn something new. Just one little critique: I noticed that the jokes in your videos have grown in number and well...loudness. In my opinion it´s a little much. The lowkey dialougs with a little bit of screaming and madness coming through here and there was perfect in my opinion. You could have a nice laugh and still focus on the actual events. Now it´s a little too much and too distracting. Less is more. The ending was great though!
37:16. Sh** he's off his meds again
Hey, want some controversial comment in your video? Make Israel vs Palestine history video :)
I'm not even american but the ending made me feel the FREEDOM
Man, Oversimplified’s videos ALWAYS raises the bar for quality with each upload.
Not enough people are talking about the thumbnail.
Ending too harsh bro
There is no way anyone could say the war of 1812 was a draw  America lost simple
The pig doesn't count as a casualty to the war because it's death caused the war not part of the war
haha
DAY OF THE RAKE!!!!! (but given the BS  the elrcted drama teacher has been doing....they might welcome their new American overloads ....I mean liberators)
I love the last part lmfao
Hahaha awesome video plz we want moooooore
your videos are so good man
Can i use vpn on console
He's back helping me mentally with my broken arm
the only thing wrong with this video is him saying burk-sheer
Well done on being 9 on trending
The ending should be the national anthem for the USA.
No one disliked this vidieo so far
31:02 I feel like no one is talking about how amazing this scene was
I lived in the UK after being born and raised in Canada and would you believe how many people thought Canada was a US state. Some people even thought that Toronto was the only city in Canada. Not everyone of course but the lack of knowledge on Canada even among Canadians is crazy. I live in Durham region and No one here knows who Lord Durham is.
The star wars based thumbnail really got me
The channel lost it
@OverSimplified you know you have to redo your oldest videos with this kind of quality right? :P The only wish I really have is that sometimes when you list important facts rather quickly in succession, is that you put that as bullet points right into the video as you speak - and you could do this "immersively" for example like you have here two persons debating over the border, there could be a chalk board in the background that lists the facts. And another example, the entire part from 7:38 until 8:10 is _filled_ with info, rushes with facts and very short cuts which is a bit too much to take in. Some of the facts are true yet overdrawn (diarrheaning), but you could still collect these facts on a post-it-like paper (maybe one that looks like an old treaty too) floating in one of the corners. That would make the videos so much more wholesome.
I convinced our history teacher to watch this in class.  PS: We live in Canada so the ending was amazing.
You don't talk enough about Mexico in your videos, lol
Me expecting the what is next made of Oversimpfield; Vietnam? Korean War? Blood and Iron?  Oversimpfield: Pig War
9:12 The Command & Conquer reference here is wonderful!
Isnt it weird, it was for me like a sport match. I was England fan.
The pig was evil you sure it wasn’t peppa pig
0:30 Russian 🇷🇺
I'm not being hyperbolic when I say, I think this is the most entertaining history video I've ever seen. 👏👏👏 Thank you.
Ok but let’s just remember. Canada has Wolverine. I don’t think the Us will win that war.
where are my fellow oregonians
The three wishes part literally KILLED ME! I laughed my ass off.
Tchaikovsky  poor pig though 19:13
*The Angry Birds* movie makes total sense now!
18:16 That spud's gotta go fast!
Its Canon... Nord Vpn is a shapeshifting, time traveling beast
I love y we need more
It's hard to believe that anybody could be a worse president than Biden. And along came your mention of Drake to prove me wrong.
I am sorry but parts of the ending must be taken out of context
"like it was given to them by god himself"  Where did I hear this before???
new video
Still waiting on Vietnam War's video
İ loved this
cool vid
This is the only platform where I will not skip Sponsor Advertisement lol. NEVER!

Ur back!
I promise I won’t get political  3 drinks later: 37:19

Do Yugoslav war?
Welcome back!!!!!!
YES! NEW VIDEO
Bidens gonna need a walker
Did he just... Make an all star reference?
I am german and proud I'm not american.
Kinnidians 🤣🤣🤣
I have to say your videos are getting better and better every time. In particular, I like how you are bringing more and more animations in to them, especially the animation with the american representatiive with the two guns. I am always laughing my ass of at the yeehaa. The one in the court was also great and how you are binding in the jokes like the ,,boring" from the jugde was also really funny.
33:22 is the greatest thing I have ever seen
CHAAAAAAAWARRRRRGE
Pro American in Canada f lol
0:18 Next dream blob
12:41 mumbo jumbo shows up on screen
Oh Oversimplified...you just don't get it, mere mortal that you are.  Canada WANTS the United States to attempt an invasion again...it's all part of the plan...to get the Queen back as the Head of State!!!
29:19
I cant believe he didn't know drake is Canadian XD
Finally he uploaded again
U can do a greek one episode
Anglo-boer war plz and shaka Zulu
Pls Indo pak 1971 war
Wish I could like a video twice
Best video yet 👍
OMG Oversimplified has a new Video!
The ending was really good. This guy becomes more confident and better with every video
I can already imagine what this video will do to the borders of the US.
Love the Back to the Future ref at 3:35
Do americans and canadians dont like each other?
lol the ending
I watched the video while I am in homeoffice, listend to it and then there was the ending... awsome and made my day xD
i’ve got 0 interest in these videos when they’re 40 minutes long
37:31 hmm red white and blue? sounds kinda russian to me.
When we manifest destiny in Canada why not do it to Mexico as well own all of North America (its a joke obviously manifest destiny was a terrible thing)
It is so funny that it was a war made by a pig who ate a potato, but wasnˇt actually a war, just a dispute that might wonˇt even hapenned if one side of a fence wasnˇt missing.
America stay winning
Omg an upload!
Finallyyyyy
*_woah woah woah, I didn’t say they were w h i t e_*
Awesome video as always! 🍻 Keep it up Bro 🤘
Oh goddam love the video and the ending just perfekt
can you please make a video on Ireland like the war of independence or 1798 rebellion or civil war thanks
This commentary makes me feels like humans in the past weren't just clowns, but an entire circus.
bro i was shot
29k th
When the shot was fired i only saw happy little trees
Cant wait for the OverSimplified of Biden invading Canada in 50 years
We wouldn’t have a problem with Mexican immigrants if we owned Mexico, just saying
31:00 Morgan freeman pig
the mob pig gave me animal farm vibes
Return of the king
spanish civel war.
Absolutely worth the wait
Best video ever!!!Keep it up friend.Don't stop making such a cool videos!!!!
The ending of this video was freaking hilarious!
poor pig
The day have come
Why don't you talk about Egypt for a video or a small series
If Biden pull out of Afghanistan is any indicator of how the invasion of Canada would go we would all be owned by Canada in a week but Canada and China would both have to have a bidding war for who actually owns America after this presidency
Wow who would have thought. Another story that shows both British and American greed. At least Germany had its time to shine for the end of the war
Question : Can you make a video about either the Vietnam War or the Korean War...Please make them come out quickly because I can't wait for you to upload a video..........By the way I take a lot of inspiration from you and I have learnt a lot since I discovered your YouTube channel so thank you for everything you did <3
Oversimplified: The only casualty of this Pig war was just a pig Potato: Am I a joke to you?
Uhmm... Slight tone change... Are u okay bruh?
CNN: "A youtube channel by the name of Oversimplified has caused mass panic in Canada due to-" Oversimplified: "Yesssssss, the seeds have been planted for a future video"  10 years after the war Oversimplified uploads a video titled: The Youtube Insight of War on Canada
"oink oink" and i took that personally
Majority people In the  comment Support POG Party in Dream smp.
Idk what happened at the end but i loved it
YES
3:34 nice makes sense what Florida was
16:00 AK-47?
the goat dropped yet again
Wouldnt have wanted it to end anyother way!
Awesome ❤
Oversimplified should do Elizabethan England or history of the British empire - that would be so much content to cover but would bring so many views
Amazing Vid Dude!!!!!!!!!
Love to see this channel trending ! Keep up the amazing work 😁
This is the coolest oversimplified video yet and doesn’t feel like oversimplificated
Everyone when ww3 starts: 😱   Oversimplified: 🤤🥴🥴🥳🥳
The Pig asking to be shot was one of the funniest parts of this video.
7:58. You sneaky sunofabitch 😏
I love ur videos there amazing
The outro tho 😂😂🤣 , love it 💖
Lol
I did not see the Morgan Freeman bit coming. Hilarious.
can u do arab-isreali war plz
33:29
FIANLYLY
Straight line? straight line  XD
We must show the Canadians that ending, everyone share this to a Canadian you know or watch.
Biden better not start tensions or war with Canada.
Finally someone captured James Buchanan in all his true glory! 😂
WHAT IS THIS ENDING 😭😭😭
MAKE HITLER OVERSIMPLIFIED PART 3!!!
"How are we going to draw the borders where the timezones meet?"   "Straight line?"   "Hell no"
He wase talk the truth Canada is not that good with military stuf but the U.S. won't atake there nabers
This is 8th on trending in Syria
Woooohoooo new video
That ending was the most emotional I’ve ever heard you honestly such a great video but my god that ending
Every video he gets better can’t wait to see with what he does next
General Harney sounds oddly familiar. But who else is an imbecile, all matter and no mind, an arrogant humbug, and a laughing stock, who has a bad relationship with Mexico, doesn't like taking orders, wastes resources, creates embarrassing situations for everyone, wants personal glory, and WANTED TO BECOME PRESIDENT?  Help me out, guys.
I hope America goes for Britan next :)
"Biden's coming baby" That was hilarious, I can't wait to see Biden invading Canada
When is Vietnam war coming?
The happines when oversimplified uplodes
This is the greatest anti-canadian propaganda I've ever seen
The last portion the video has been sponsored by the U.S Government
Thank you for your inclusion of the US owned Port Roberts in the maps when you show pig island! Attention to detail is very important.
Where was i am before ? This video is my cup of tea 😘
I guess we ride at dawn? Right?
This video is amazing! The animation, the jokes, everything!
A NEW VIDEO COOL!!!!
Goat is back
I will stop watching your videos. I mean keep your gay feelings for yourself. I’m not also sharing my straight feelings all the time on the internet
Me with the angry birds
Even tho Canada on it own will lose it will call lots of help making it a draw
Is this Mini-Wars #5?
love this chanale
Yoo he is back
32:04 the beginning of the best scene of this episode trust me.
Now you probably could take canada. But we'd fight hard for it
When I say the thumbnail I thought: "Pig wars: The last pig"
It’s interesting to see oversimplified slowly become less and less sane
'hey guys we just finished our bloody war with white people...but we can go to war with people in the west because they are not white people'   <----------logic
I would love to see a video on the troubles in Ireland/ Northern Ireland or even when Ireland became an independent nation from Britain.
For the record- the British soldiers in the war of 1812 were all people from the Canadian colonies. They were born there, they were raised there, or they moved there, but they were Canadians running a British flag, not british.
this is great.
finally back I love this channel so much
As a Canadian I say:          Naw
Pls do india independence pls I your big fan
The funny thing is that reality is probably closer to this than how historians would dress it. History is always so cut and dry as that is how it is normally documented, but realistically. Yeah. Most ordeals where caused by petty things and stupid people... Like a LOT of stupid people. Only ending up resolved once someone with some common sense walks in and starts overruling the dumb stuff.
31st on trending here in PH 🇵🇭
Noic3
That line is the straighthest thing in the us
We have come a long way to have a little bit of peace in our time, we really have.
But why stopping at Canada?
But why stopping at Canada?
Final a new video me and me friwnd though something happened to you
I don't know what you took ... but please send me details :D
Wow,the ending is impressive！
only shit this took over 1 year to make very nice but more content please
Make a videos on the Israeli-Arab conflicts, please. That would be very interesting!
That ending took a serious turn
there was nothing to watch thanks Oversimplified for coming in with a clutch
Great as always!
So not just a bunch of normal people making a dumb mistake.  But at least two of the most genuinely stupid people in the country were involved.
Gotta buy this plush
37:07 was out of pocket
NGL That plushie looks creepy
TBH that episode seems boring. Almost 40 minutes about such things seems like overcomplicated not oversimplified. From technical view and narrations it's good but the topic is for me definitely not worthy such time. It would be good for mini wars thought.
i wtf now but a war over a littel island and a pig cool vid  btw
The great Mexican American War would be nice to see a episode on
I missed his voice. 🥰 Finally a new video!
He’s back!
And when the World Needed him most....            HE RETURNED!!!!!!
Why didn't they fix Point Roberts during this?
"Watch Out Canadians, Cuz Biden's Coming, Baby"
finally a new video
This was awesome, great work.
Are there any Canadians offended her3
The legend came back
Okay, where is Vietnam!?
You forgot about Canada :/
He just woke up.
Well... it's been real guys, see y'all in 2 years
That was such an inspiring speech.  The Canadians must be snaking  in their boots right now
After so long time
And they won't stop coming
O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all of us command.  With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free!  From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
I can’t wait for the United States of Canada
Make more videos
You ever get the feeling manifest destiny was just a desire for a symmetrical map?
At this point, i love both the history and comedy bits added.
Plz make a video about the Turkiish Indepence War next
We simply…. Love you :)
finnaly a new upload
THE LEGEND IS BACKKK
Anyone else going to bring up the erm.... Suggestive nature.. of Florida in the personified United States? (for reference: 3:30 )
In just so little period of its existence America has the most eventful history ever!
I swear some of the faces in this ARE going to give me nightmares.
It was a beautiful and fun ring👍🏻
and thats when america was destroyed when they attacked canada
invade us and die
I love the thumbnail 🤣🤣
there is no Canada, there is only use
Nah ... You already invaded a lot of nations ... I think its enough for you ...
Been waiting for another video from Oversimplified, I now feel complete😂
OMG fking epic
Next oversimlified vid: The war in the north. How Sweden fought the most wars in a small time
Could you make a video about the gulf war ?
Loved the sudden All stars recreation at 7:58
To shoot a mockingbird?  To shoot a pig.
-An this is how ww3 started, my son -So, you wanna say me what nucklear war happens, because some funny man make video about "crisis over a shot pig", there joked about the invasion of Canada, what provoked the Internet war, which provoked an international crisis? -Yep -it turns out that the Third World War began because of a pig? -Probably Yes .................... -The lesson is that people are idiots?  -Yes, people are idiots
if youre canadian, dont click on 37:40
You're #31 on trending in my country. Congrats.
The really important question is: What if Lyman had accepted the three wishes?
I get that the ending is satire, but I think you went a little overboard Oversimplified.😕
could you do a video about the 7 years war?
I love this
Turkish Independence warrrr plsss or the ottomans
If you want oversimplified to talk about you so much then why don't you get a better history
I can smell those short meme videos al over YouTube already.
HE IS ALIVE
I love the ending haha
Face reveal?
Who knew they named an entire island dispute after a meme
can you make a video on the six day war?
Don’t worry boys, the 18th… no The 19th… no The 20th… no The 21st century will be the century we finally take Canada!
The War Pig seems a more appropriate title.
me: hey britan and america USA&UK: wat u want me: why u let german empire decide they literally have no relevance to de case USA&UK: thats why we chose then Me: wait wat
Finally
Please do a video on Newfoundland next
He back
As a Canadian, I thank the British that I dont live within the US
Intersting c:
Idk man 38 million actual frozen savages VS. 320 million Americans seems pretty fair to me
RULE BRITAINIA
“Let’s Go Brandon but where are the lights?” - Joe Biden, Supreme Overlord of Canada
Now do the vid showing that when every civilization in human history was busy enslaving their neighbors, it was the United Stated and Great Britain who sacrificed vast resources and power in order to abolish slavery in their own countries and across the globe, and they continue to wage the war against slavery today. In Africa today there are nearly triple the number of slaves that ever existed throughout the entire history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to colonial America. Yeah, do that vid, ya America bashing loons.
yess new video
80 year wat please
17:21 Technically you can plant potato seeds, but it's way more efficient to plant potatoes, so that's what potato farmers actually do.
37:12 Barney Stinson joins the chat

This was too cringe. You used to be amazing oversimplified, now you're trying too hard with the jokes
2090, home, sitting on my chair and drinking hot coffee "grandpa, I found this old pin of Abe Lincoln in your stuff. What is it?" "sit down, son. I'm gonna tell you a great story"
I missed you so much I love nepoleon so much please post more
7:57 GREAT
This was unexpectedly funny XD
A pig eating a potato..... sounds... familiar
Bide might invade Mexico instead given how his memory is failing him
Pretty sure Canadians are pissing in their pants right now LoL 😆
4:11 i was in tears for 10 minutes after that
Dude ! make a video about the iranian constitutional or islmic revolutions .

1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
I really liked the end part . Lol it was extremely funny
The Pig never dies, never question him again!
should make an emu plushie, would buy
im sad you didnt go into detail on the war of 1812... but still a fun video :)
La fin de la vidéo m'a juste terminé
I don't think people get the ironic ending, it was woke humour, US wouldn't do the same to Canadians that they did with the Indians becasue God said so.
Brits: No you can’t keep gaining more land!! Also brits: *takes over basically the entire world*
can you do the first balkan war oversimplefied
I bet he spent an hour doing that last 2 minutes  I salute  you sir
I especially appreciated the call to invade Canada
The ending killed me
36:56 Did anyone else think this was about to lead into an AlternateHistoryHub crossover?
7:15 "I've got my spotted-" U FOKIN' WOT M8??
My man pleeeeeeeeease make a video about Turkish Independence war. Its very interesting
Great job man. You completely let the cat out of the bag on our plans with Canada

Fort Ticonderoga:  HELLA GUNS! HELLA AMMO Oversimplified, 2021
Hi
Holy shit, my dudes and dudettes, the god damn McDonald's and the stealth bombers at 4:12 was golden comedic genius.
Great
The 1000 AC war Oversimplefied pls
I really hope the next video ain't going to take up to 8 months
When you said about Pickett being dead last in his class, it made me think of his line in Gettysburg. "The Yankees got all the smart ones! Lookit where it got them!"
"The only casualty was just a pig" excuse me sir what abt spuddy huh? what abt SPUDDY!
I live on Vancouver island close to the jaundufuca islands. Ima start this war back up again even though my side won. SH always makes wars look like so much fun.
The straight line moments are hilarious.
Pickett: *makes blunder after blunder in defense of territory*  Me, who knows about his behavior at the Battle of Five Forks in 1865: "...Yeah, that tracks."
I don’t think Oversimplified likes Canada not being American
that animation is so smooth 8:47
Yes
Finally
Straight line? Straight line.
Berkshire is pronounced like "Barkshear" congrats on getting the second part of the word correct, though.
Harney and Pickett would be a good tv show
As a canadian, i dont know how i feel after that last part.
34:46 Harney was sus😳Amogus
The ending is the reason why YouTube remove dislike button
Imagine having 3 millions views in one day. Wow!
YOU'RE BACK!
He’s slowly losing his mind
lol florida is America's hamburger boner.
can you do the communist take over in china in the next video please?
BTS CALL OUT BABY😆😆😆😆
We will bring freedom to Alberta, Canada!
Talk about Ireland
Pogggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
I feel like the British should have gotten the island since well, the Americans already got like five times the land. I am writing a quarter way through though Edit: Never mind Americans are as stupid as I thought. Also I’m American so I speak from experience. Some of us really need to put the gun down.
I enjoyed the video tho, I wonder what topic is next.
A new video from oversimplified makes my rough week a lot less rough. Entertaining and educational as always.
*This is the most inspiring content I've ever seen, very originäl.* 🏆
7:57 "But the Americans keep coming, and don't stop coming, hop on their wagons and hit the ground running" Man's a genius😂😂😂😂
Man this is one of my favourite videos so far, good job mate.
The war should be renamed to Pigpotato war
5th on trending
Boy the closing monologue was worthy of an Oscar,just amazing.Oversimplified can’t stop cracking me up,you guys are amazing 😀😃🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
RIP piggy. Gone but not forgotten!
Hilarious keep up the good work
cant believe that the shooting of your great-great-grandmom almost started a war
The sheer joy of seeing an Oversimplified video pop up is only replaced by the sadness knowing that there’s not gonna be another one for a few months.  But still, EXCELLENT work as always, I love these videos so much
If history has taught me, is that humanity will tear itself apart for a bucket, pig or any petty reasons to jusify their selfish gains.
Do the Zimbabwean colonisation
I love how bit by bit each episode is becoming more and more chaotic and insane.
The ending is what happens when you start drinking, so don't get drunk :)
I was waiting for Vietnam war but this is also too cool
OH YES I NEED MORE OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best end to a youtube video ever
Want a video on indian independence movement
Now canada got mention Philippines next
The humour and jokes involved could have been a wee bit better. But overall, Oversimplified, even though I love History, and learnt a lot from these videos, your videos are the only videos I watch multiple times just for entertainment. Kudos to you!
still waiting for the 7 years war oversimplified
Next Turkish Independence War
More please?
He wrote wrong 3:37 he wrote density not destiny.
The ending was awesome!!!!! The video was good, but not as much as expected...
Not quite what happend in the start but accurate ( aside from the obvious political bias ) good video
7:14 The Rock eyebrow raise
Ahahaha this is brutal. Hilarious representation of conquest and the realities of human history, however.
All the Canadians after watching the ending be like:
Is this the same Pickett as the Charge at Gettysburg?
please make a video about the Indian independence
US-Canada War Date: Soon OverSimplified video date: Soon after Cause: The ending of this video
I'm not even an American but I got patriotic at the end
LETSGOOO
6moths later
This video was a giant shitpost love it
7:58 smash mouth moment  why no one talking about this
I love the "All-Star" reference at 8:00
so That's why black Sabbath had a song called war pigs
Nooo not the poor pig
rude for saying in front of canadians
Oh sponsores makes a good man bad and makes this poor dog sad.We know your secret that you try to hide.   Time to pay for the law you broke. There's bad things that happen to ones like you,and now it's time that you pay the price.   Trapped on this place you must endure,for ads are against the law!    So what becomes of our good ole' advert friend? Can't go home or meet his pals.   He broke the law and must pay for it. Remember that adverts are wrong, and the law wins!
Noice but waiting for next one
For our first crisis in the 3rd year of the Flaming 2020s, Oversimplified gets investigated by the FBI for inciting a diplomatic crisis between the US and Canada.
Can I get mines free My parents are afraid of getting the money stolen from the credit card
OMG OMG OMG OMG A NEW VIDEO
Me : india has a very big history.  Oversimplified : nahh I don't know a place called india exists, I swear on life I won't make a detailed video on indian historic event 👍👍.
The return of the king:
sounds like someone’s a little heated
I'm ashamed to say that I laughed way too hard at the part where America grew from the territory it had after the Louisiana Purchase to when it became the lower 48 (that includes Florida *wink wink*)
The Smug-nosed Neighbors to the North, with Their Affordable Insulin: A Manifesto of Invading Canada
If you want to hear the speach at the end again the here!👉: 37:10
Imagine the canadian government watching this
I love it that they are growing I remember there first episode animation is good but not as great as his new vid
finally a vid
:0  - i am finally not at least 3 months late
Jokes aside,invading Canada will probably start world war three
When we start winning, do we get their healthcare/dental? I'm just saying... I can fight a lot harder with all my teeth! 😂
I live for your videos
anyone realized that he loaded up his gun two times even though he hasnt shoot the pig yet
23:05 that gave me like Trevor Philip vibes
Odd how US is a huge place now with plenty of land, but there wasn't enough for everybody back then.
Shame it's turned into woke virtue signalling.
"How do you describe the United States summed up?"  I got you fam.  37:10
Omg the ending
can you make one about franco and the spanish civil war?
14:28 This made me laugh, I swear I'm 5 years old sometimes
33:30 *This Enraged Winfield Scott Who Punished Harney Severely !!*
5:58 literally my reaction
What I'm taking away from this is... USA is going to invade Canada. Great, into the bunker again. Loved it
FINALLYYYYYY
Second video asking for Six Day War or Yom Kippur War
Let's be real, this ending was the most epic ending in all of Oversimplified history
This is trending in Canada and at the end *Spoiler* he claims the US will invade Canada
After almost half a year woohh
Canada and the US have border gore that ruins the lives of hundreds of children since there's a tiny little chip of land belonging to the USA that's NOT connected to the USA, and it doesn't have a secondary school there, so children living there have to cross the Canadian border into British Columbia, walk... oh I don't know, a few dozen miles back into the US border just to go to school, and repeat the journey back home every day. Why doesn't that piece of land belong to Canada? It would be so much better
PLS Turkish Civil War
None other youtubers can make a pig killing scene that thrilling  like oversimplified
The amount of patriotism that overwhelmed my body as that ending appeared on my screen? Truly impressive. I rate that ending a 10 Crosses of the Delaware out of 10.
I wonder what Canadians think about that ending
the ending was hilarious :DD OOOH CANA-DUUHHH
Oversimplified, Scramble for Africa vid soon? Just a suggestion
I feel like this video will be hated by a lot of american, but it's great! :D
HE IS BACK
The ending was LOL
Noice
Yes, i come here to mess up my sleeping schedule...
Ok so ill see a new video next year
Honestly would love America to invade Ontario

Rods from gravity falls with different pallet of colors.

Love the voice work and scripting. The "You psychopath" part took me by great  surprise.
I don’t think joe Biden even knows where Canada is at this point
*checks out new video of oversimplified* *realizing he will disappear for years*
Did you notice Spaghetti Jeff in this episode? (and every episode since war of the bucket?) Good luck finding him 😏
Gotta do Spanish-American war

NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED
Oversimplified: talks about invading Canada and how we have no nukes.  Me, who was born in Saskatchewan, where Uranium is stupidly common and abundant: *"Who needs nukes when we have a whole province that's basically just one big dirty bomb?"*
I love you "OverSimplified"
see you again for another quality video
WOÒOOOOOO
WOÒOOOOOO
WOÒOOOOOO
dude that ending was so hilarious
Christmas came early
This is the most American video oversimplified has ever made
YOOOO ITS A NEW VID
The return of the king
Best video i've seen on youtube just after even more entertaining than mr beast squid game
That ending though. xD
16:01 american politician, uses the second most russian gun ever. Makes perfect sense
Me a Canadian: oooooh new video pog Me watching the ending: oh no Me realizing I live 3 hours away from the US border: OH NO  Edit: I admit the ending was pretty epic and based despite being threatened to be invaded by my favorite youtuber. What am I gonna do be butthurt and cry about it in the comments? But hey if oversimplified does ever invade canada, At least let's give him a warm welcome.
the americans keep coming and they dont stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running didn't make sense to keep sharing oregon  when they outnumber the brits 6-1
14:35 you're welcome.
He's finally back :)
"Because Biden is coming".....hm,it would be a miracle if he got out of his bed without falling over..............Anyway,great video.
I fucking love your videos 😂
This video made my day! Best one yet!
Not gonna lie, seeing sombody walking normal in this guy's video is very unsettling. XD
yay!your back!
Could you make a vedio aboute the Mexican american war
3M views in 24 hours. Amazing.
bro  where were u
Long have i waited for this
British won the war of 1812*
My American brothers- we MUST bring civilization to those poor Canadians. They know nothing of freedom or warmth....simply maple syrup and a cold frosty day. With our armies, we shall bring THE POWER OF THE SUN!!
I don't really like this video. There is too much entertainment and too little education. Sure, most of the characters in the discussion of the video were incompetents and uneducated but that doesn't mean they have to have an even uglier image. Recently, I have watched a video from The Critical Drinker called Why Modern Movies Are Bad (Sucks), the second part, which explains why the modern Star Trek Movies are horrible. His main argument was that the characters and new and old movies had social role as military units. In the old movies, the characters had a high skill, experience and vocabulary, which it's fitting for the roles they have. I think everyone knows that war it's not a play but a gruesome experience and in the new movies of the series the characters act like they are just some teenagers in uniforms. That's just a horrible image because of this contrast. After watching this video I felt like I actually finished one of the new Star Trek movies. If you're reading this, please consider to be more educational or informational rather then entertaining because your audience might get bad perspectives if you keep going on that lane. Thank you for your contribution on the history content and please consider what I've mentioned.
Look at how many views this man gets in 1 day
You should do oversimplified constitutional convention!
ah yes.technoblade
last part had me laughing for hours
I like the star wars thumbnail
I don't understnd modern americans, always spitting to their own history and convey an image of JUST bloodshed and reckless killing.
i dont know guys, oversimplified seems very patriotic
The ending was glorious
I'm rewatching this for the third time already. The amount of quality, comedy and love in these videos are just insane. Every video steps it up a notch and I just can't anymore.
You know what? He's got a point. If Canada can't figure out Quebec, *we'll do it for them.*
Just throwing it out there but America couldnt hold Iraq let alone Afghanistan so if ever you all try for Canada, good luck lol
That most of laugh 9:19
That ending were literally the most American thing ever
OverSimplified, one of the purest joys of Youtube!
this is by faar ! your best video
If the US ever tried to invade Canada, the rest of the world would rise up in the defense of Canada... including Canada's ally: The Winter.... You heard it here: Winter is coming!
You don't talk about Canada enough in your videos
bruh this guy is getting crazier by each video
I remembered reading about this, dumbest history I've read by far
Where’s spaghetti Jeff???
pls do balkan wars in 1991
You've got some serious problems bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is everyone just gonna ignore that he made a reference to all stars? 7:57
This has the best sponsor introduction by far. I can't stop rewatching.
Les gooooooooo new video
wouldn't be nice if Oversimplified made a video about the Arab-Israeli conflict?!
ahahahahahahahaha that ending was fantastic
Pig: If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you could ever imagine!
wt
Spuddy's death was the saddest one in history.
You had forgotten about point Roberts
HOLD UP!!! when did an American get a Soviet communist AK-47
3:38 is “density” intentional?
DONT GIVE THEM IDEAS
Oversimplified, the only channel that can make sponsored ads interesting
Everyone: Is an idiot  The Royal Navy: *cries in just wanting to enjoy their gosh darned tea and biscuits without having to blow someone up for once*
Lets be honest, when you think about it, at this point, it's probably possible that Biden would sign an order form declaring war on Canada, thinking he was ordering some ice cream from there or something.
when the ad is the funniest part of a video 6:10
You know it is a good day when Oversimplified uploads
finallyyyyyy a videoooooo
The general : screen  Meh : laughing in Thailand ver
Biden's coming for vengeance its part of the manifest destiny
Great Poetry - 7:57 !!! 😀😆😂👍
the legend is back
Wish this was history 1:20
First Canada then Greenland then the world
PLEASE make more historical videos
Listen to me over simplified. We have a few months until April 20th. You might think your channel is popular now but wait until you see what happens when you post a "war on drugs" episode on 4/20
they DEFINITELY kissed  it's the law
Here are some ideas to oversimplify next time: the Middle Ages,/ 100-years-war, the Duchy of Burgundy, Charles the Second of Spain, the 1812 war, the Belgian revolution, the 80-years war
Well, if the Bris had some guns, this would not happen.
37:13 OverSimplified you fool, our invasion has already begun. In 2021, the National Hockey League created the Seattle Kraken, in an attempt to increase tensions across the border between Seattle and Vancouver. And with both teams currently duking it out for last place in the Pacific Division, I fear a war with our Canadian brothers and sisters is inevitable.
Oversimplified:- I think I’m forgetting something  Audience:- if u r forgetting then it’s not important Oversimplified:- yes you’re right Indians willing to get Indian history videos:-: hello darkness old friend
Oversimplified ran mad at the end
why it's look like snowman? 0:14
There was not just one Dead PIG there was a potato also.
God darn it! Americans have always yearned to invade and occupy.   Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. After all, the white Americans are descendants of Europeans.
I had already watched this before and I wad notified and I am still watching it right now. :)
37:56 chill out light yagami xD   Still amazing video man
You diserve 10000000000M Subs
16:00 an American using an AK-47?
31:52 did he just... pumped that SxS shotgun there?
"Straight Line?" "Straight Line." God that made me laugh-
Poor Canada! Lol! Amazing  Video Keep it uo dude
POV: Patriotic Ending 10/10
Lol
I was hoping for something else
Babe wake up. Oversimplified posted
The american puls out an AK47 in the 19th century Why tf is that the funiest thing in this video to me
lmao this dude is funny while giving genrally correct info,tho why is it only he that narrates lmao
I floop the pig
Babe wake up, OverSimplified has uploaded
*10 IQ* : _make informative videos about important historical events_ [37:08] *100 IQ* : _make videos about alternate versions of important historical events_ *1000 IQ* : _start an important historical event yourself and then make a video about it_
hes baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
what is the name of this track at the background plz 36:17
Now I knew Why Biden withdrew all forces from Afghanistan. He's going to Invade Canada with a new vengeance. So oversimplified is the mastermind behind all of the shenanigans taking place in 2021.
American invasion of Canada might be the first war Canada loses    Come on Biden , do it
I've seen a lot of stuff over here in Oversimplified. But damn, I certainly do NOT expecting to see THAT shot at Benjamin's curves.
The war of 1812 was won by the British
finally a new vid
Music at 0:30 anyone?
legend
OverSimplified is right we need to avenge spuddy! Biden is coming baby!
Bruh... What did this just turn into? Some propoganda for the preemptive takeover of Canada? I LOVE IT 😍
I was expecting technoblade here.
36:57 and lovely potatoes !!!
12:43 to 13:31. Can we talk about this masterpiece of comedy ?
we want "THE INDIAN REVOLUTION:OVERSIMPLIFIED"
so you're saying that whites will kill me in seconds
I AM BLACK IN REAL LIFE
escuse me
This video was more of an insight into Oversimplified's vagueness rather than The Pig War
HOW DID I NOT HEaR ABOUT THIS
Punic wars next please
I DIDNT GET A NOTIFICATION HOW DARE YOU YOUTUBE !!!
Christmas has come early this year
Its really awesome that the publish date are the same as when the Pearl harbor on 1941 happened, thanks for sympathy Oversimplified, that date will be never forget
By the way things are going, the flag will probably be red with 5 yellow stars.
Nice
Straight line?
The scene of them baa-ing at each other is gonna be stuck in my hewd for a good few days
কলিজার ভাই  একটা ,সাবসক্টাইব চাইলাম  ছোট ভাই হিসেবে করে দেন please 😭😭🙇‍♂️💖💖💖🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️💖💖🙇‍♂️
কলিজার ভাই  একটা ,সাবসক্টাইব চাইলাম  ছোট ভাই হিসেবে করে দেন please 😭😭🙇‍♂️💖💖💖💖
oh hey this sounds familiar 7:57
300K likes within a day's time, thats the power of The Oversimplified community!!!!!!🤙
"That be the way in which things be the way they are, is it?" *"Is it??"*
This still seems like American foreign policy now, if they don't like the government just invade and say you were looking for Nuker weapons instead of cattle!!🤣
Next video:War of the ending.
Poor pig 🥺
mannn we love you and your videos. Please never stop making this amazing content.
I know this is oversimplified and there are nuances you can't always get deep into, but this felt oversimplified to the point it was extremely anti white and anti American
Finally he back
Can please make British Raj in India next
yes
31:03
What we needed most love you OVERSIMPLIFIED
O_O
This video will cause WW3
That ending kinda made me think of fallout...US annexing canada
Describing the American spread West as like rats or a disease is not exactly the smartest or fairest of things to say, given that almost everyone who did the spreading were poor working class or agricultural families just trying to make a living on new farmland while most of the atrocities were committed by government troops who came a bit later to claim enforce their rule. Its also not a very smart metaphor because its exactly the same metaphor that is being used to describe the spread of people today, commonly known as immigrants.  Protraying the majority of families in hardship seeking a new life of oppurtunity out west (much like immigrants today) in the same light as brutal government troops and the minority of settlers hell bent on racist genocide is unfair and inappropriate.
Yeah what the f…. Bloody knew it. Nord vpn.
The way his voice changed so sharply from history teacher lecturing to terrifyingly patriotic American is both concerning and glorious.
Me watching the ending: “what the fu-“   war between the US and Canada started  Me: “WOAH WOAH WHAT THE FU-“  me getting killed by a nuclear nuke that missed its target
Technoblade
Draw yeeee
The canadians that saw this video are going to declare war
Is there arabic translation
As someone who grew up in this area I remember learning about the Pig War in school, but then in the years after when I would mention it to people they would not know what I was talking about. Thank you for this video so I can know I wasn't just making things up
Up next us Mexican war
3:33 Okay you totally did that on purpose with Florida.
That glorious final ! I totally wanna invade Canada now.
Did anyone else get a death note light Yagami vibe from the Canada rant ?
amerika with AK47, Interesting.
Try replacing the word "tribe" with "people". So much more respectful, accurate and less racist. Other than that, great video!
I'm gonna have to side with griffin....
3:34 florida is looking kinda weird ??? Explain
After 6 Months ??? Seriously ???? What took you so long ???
33:30 *DAT Harney's Girlish Scream** 😂😂😂
Then a hundred years later the USS San Juan startet the great sput battle
"No the swine is the one I killed, I'm lyman"
I need more videos from u
I had to spend 3 years learning the same boring Washington history again and again and this was the only thing that ever intrigued me
Ending is goated
31:01 wtf was that. that made me laugh man.
Imagine Oversimplified being the rallying call for the US invasion of Canada…
its a amazing how people from europe came to amerika and start claiming and arguing of which part of the land are theira while native people is comsidered pest to them...
WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?! I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY! :D
I'll give you my right kidney, my appendix, and half of my liver if you release another video in 5 months instead of 6
Great one, yet again - to show support, I bought 2 of your t-shirts. Anyway, my latest issue of Spice Girls Fan Club has just arrived, time for a nice cup of tea.   👍
28:00 / 28:55 James Buchanan = Joe Biden in 19th century
He. Shot. The. Pig.
3 million views in just a day wow
pls do yugoslavia next
16:01 the irony is him using a Russian AK 47 and not an American made m16
Never heard about this incident, curious how the possible war would have played out, while US being on the verge on its own civil war.  Judging by the Canadian hockey, they would have been able to kick 'Muricans back to the original territories of the thirteen colonies, while outnumbered and outgunned.
US invade Canada Me : OH, ok that’s look dangerous Some of Hololive EN is Canadian Me : HOLY SMOKE SEND HELP TO THEM
33:23 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
INDIA - PAKISTAN WARS NEXT PLZZZ
None of the Channel
I was hoping for the 7 Years War..........................          But this is fucking Hilarious
yes your back
Damn, perfect
31:01 the pig was Morgan Freeman afterall.
It seems someone didnt want Harney to get away SCOTT free
Why map in the first minute is without poland ?
Finally, now do Vietnam war
We miss you man
If I'm being honest here, this has to be least liked video from your channel, for me. Because of too much "cringe jokes" ;-;
... What did I just watch?
29:10 Probably one of the most accurate depictions of a US President on the internet
12:00 Love the Kerbal Space Program music
North american empire huh
Cringe
Too much cringe "jokes", too little history.
7:59 You almost remake the shrek song
I have enjoyed your "Simplified" videos of the past but it you seem to be taking more of a leftwards bend, and unnecessarily so. Please stop.
Christmas came early this year, boys
The pig looks like Waddles from Gravity Falls which is set in Oregon 💀
Loved the new video :D
Now to wait another 6 months until the next video…
20:30 In case you were wondering what mistake he made in the heading, it was that he wrote "REPOORT" instead of "REPORT"
No 1 trending in UK
Vietnam: Oversimplified  Pls <3 ^_^
How that nord vpn thing just arrived was awesome
That Buchanan sketch was bloody genius
As a European i agree Canada belongs to Murica!
Canadians: He forgets us every time Oversimplified: ...and I took that personally
I hear voices all the time - good one.
I'd wanna see Biden try
What's that song at the beginning with Jefferson?
Biden is so old, he could remember his grandfather telling about the events in this clip.
Ridiculously excited that our lil' ol' Vancouver Island got an OverSimplidied video 🥰🍁
damn no Indonesian subtitles
Possibly the best Oversimplified yet.
The more I learn about the American history, the more I hate America
Make Vietnam War pliz
I like this guy narrates and the way his cartoons are. Keep it up
loved the sound effects from warzone the risk like game
Fomo :(
Is this the true story? Is it really the real, is it?.
Can you make a video about the Vietnam war?
38:02 Imagine disliking a video because your irrelevant country wasn’t mentioned in it 💀
I died when he just broke out w the song
This channel has been a great teacher of history to me! And its getting better with every new videos. Oh, ye master Oversimplified, please do take your time in creating great quality content like these. Thank you and have my single, lonely like!
Canadians: *chuckles* "I’m in danger"
We've had the War of the Bucket, The Emu War and now, the Pig War..... will we get the Battle of the Kettle?
Oversimplified only upload every 6 months but the wait is worth it!
Waiting for another video 😂  How about Japan, Korea, Spain, Holy Roman Empire,Persia Hindustan 😂
12:20 & 19:20 Still BETTER LOVE STORY than *Twilight* and *Fifty Shades of Gray*
Is it just me? Or is this the funniest episode he made? I cried laughing throughout the whole episode xD
12:20 OBJ be like
The God returns!
Watching this from Canada like please don’t. We’re happy here without the craziness and hippies you have south of the border
That ending is gold lmao
You know it’s time to start getting hyped when you see Oversimplified last uploaded 6 months ago
19:32 Aww now I feel bad for Griffin
That twist ending though
could  you make video about the fight for indian independence?
Can u make video on indo pak war 1971
This is why technoblade never dies and you should always let him have his potatos
Good to see you back ❤❤
You're really just going to gloss over the war of 1812 like that? It's actually really interesting.
Im Canadian and I find the ending funny.   Americans are The Simpsons, Canadians are Flanders.
As a Canadian I would enjoy too see it just to see my prime minister get shit on
Ladies and gentlemen...          *The Return of the King*
yooo another oversimplified video, its been a loooong time
When i saw a new oversimplified vid: "Its bin 98 years"
info to joke ratio is getting too low i love some of your work but this one overstayed its welcome
Amazing. XD
At 5:56 NORDVPN: Well then you, my friend, should use NORDVPN! Guy: WHAT THE FS@$
Man, Americans have always been really racist huh?
Phew...with that ending I'm just glad, Trump isn't President any longer. That might have given him ideas...
The worst part is that now I am gonna have to wait another 6 months to get some quality content....
The "just as god intended" scene is probably the best recap of all American history.
That ending made my patriotism level soar to 1783%
As a Canadian fan, gotta say.......  Probably the best ending to one of your videos yet, haha!
These white people sure love beavers!
After 6 months he revived , thank god
Is it only me who is hearing that his voive changed
Ffwfdwffwf
Your NordVPN bits are the only ads imbedded into a video I watch all the way through.
31:03 MORGAN FREEMAN?
Sure, invade Canada - until you realize that deep freeze y’all had in Texas is our weather about 9 months out of the year, you have to sell a kidney to buy alcohol in B.C. - oh, and would love to talk to you about our tax rate. But sure, come on over eh?
This video got 100% retention time from me
Canadians: oh shoot                 i always skip to 37:15 to laugh
Okay I'm sorry I won't comment anything Canadian anymore that outro scared me
You americans sleep with one eye open
gee this pickett guy sounds really familar--and then OS mentioned pickett's charge and i felt like an idiot
Can you PLEASE STOP using abbreviated swear words on you channel. My children loves to learn from you videos, but you keep ruing your videos with unnecessary obscene speech. PLEASE STOP DOING THIS. Many thanks By the way, are your videos intended for children or adults ??
Imagine covering WWI in under 14 minutes and spending nearly 40 on the Pig War.      Imagine being that much of a chad...
2:34 Rice Farmers : */Laugh in Vietnamese*  Radical Shepherds : */Laugh in Pashtuni*
Day 1 of asking for a Vietnam War
I love when oversimplified uploads a new video
Finally u make content!!!
DO THE EGG WAR!
33:23 lmaoooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:25 *I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt!*
*"I hear voices all the time"*
I’ll be curious for a recent wars/history  or other hilarious wars escapes
I live in Victoria BC, Canada... And I doubt 90% of folks in my town know the history like you portrayed. I've frolicked around on all those Gulf Islands.   You put out ridiculously informative and humourous content! Thanks and Cheers!
This is like an early Christmas gift from overSimplified
God I love for the Buchanan bits
0:48 New Frontier and Wild West Backstory in a Nutshell
If you plan on doing another video after Christmas, here’s a challenge, the Yugoslav wars (Just want to see the history video, not meaning anything about it)
9:12: "No Russian"  Day 3 - 08 : 40 : 54 PFC Joseph Allen a.k.a Alexei Borodin Zakhaev International Airport Moscow. Russia
Why your so late
you should make a video about romanian history
The ending isn't a threat, it's a warning
His vids are too good make more please
Ah yes, making history a race thing and talking about "imperialism" in 19th century... cringe.
It is very sad knowing that a pig was historically  more important than me and all of my ancestors
Being Americans they pulled out their guns
The ending was hands down the best part lol
the end bit, youre kind of ignoring the fact that if you do go to war with canda, other countries will intervene and stop you, but ok, that was a funny bit
I’m in awe of the level of animation here. It’s crisp and amazing.
Its be so long
Where’s Technoblade?
Just the way he said "BIDENS COMING BABY" is probably the funniest part
Do a video on the Indian freedom struggle...it'd make a great video
This is like its own universe...You got the small guys working on solving the island crisis, the big players fighting the world war, the other guys fighting the people in power and starting a revolution other players fighting prohibition....and all of this coming together for an ambitious crossover in history
Not enough history
Did he just? At @ 7:58
"Enhance"
I fell laughing watching that ending 😂😂😂
Make a video about the Mongol Empire, please. lol
Hi OS, could you do the philippines next? I think its history is interesting. I'd like to see your take in it.
Probability:   bird pooping on you=1/10 finding a pink sheep in minecraft=1/100 000  a new oversimplified video=1/100 000 000
I never heard such emotion in Oversimplified's voice until the ending popped up 😂
Bruh
As an American, I'd rather Canada invade us so that we can get that sweet FREE healthcare system and require everyone to be vaccinated before they enter the country.
8:56 hey bud you missed 5 americans there better get them out (top left)
37:17 looks like the Fallout universe is becoming more and more a reality as time goes by..
The end 😂
We mexicans had a similar thing with a bakery, but that one actually resulted in war.
Pls do a video about the balkan war
So, we're just not going to talk about the KSP background music huh?
Straight line? Straight line. 😂
18:45 Top 10 saddest anime deaths

Finnaly new video
I hope 300 years from now historians see the outro and think that's how all Americans are.
New Video Yesssssssssssssssssssss
"I dint say they were WHITE people...!!!!" Hahaha this one really got me... The scriptwriter rocks...!!!!
"Biden's comin' with a VENGEANCE!!!" That esclated quickly
As an American who has been living in Vancouver for the past 5 years, this was absolutely delightful! I loved learning more about the history of the region, hearing where names originated, and some quality US propaganda 👌
I love your videos as they are ALL educational and very humorous while learning something you may not be all the familiar with. But, this video TAKES THE CAKE! Canada needs to watch their backs.
Istg this man is going insane with each and every episode he makes xD
I hope NordVPN or Honey never run out of money to support oversimplified
Canadians : 👀
The last minute was the most hilarious meme ever😂😂
There are 0 dislikes think about it even the Canadians want to be invaded
as a Canadian, the ending is completely hilarious
At the end I felt threatened lol
good job OverSimplified good job
The  morgan freeman line was op
omg 40 minutes
Who is watching this during storm barra
I MISSED YOU GUYSSS! I thought u were not coming back 🙂😃😃😃
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, CANADA.
I....uhhhh... I think you kinda got a bit sidetracked there at the end, buddy
Best History channel on YouTube 😌
Now you don't talk about india
“As easy as marching” gets ass kicked by a bunch of militia farmers 😂😂
You should make a video about the fall of Rome. It’s an epic period of history
Do an oversimplified of fallout!
Balkan Wars Oversimplified please
We dont need a story teacher  We have OverSimplified as a best story teacher
Morgan Freeman pig was a surprise, but a welcome one.
I think it’d be hella entertaining if you did an episode on the Hatfields and McCoys, none of my favorite history channels has done a video on them yet.
I love the all-star reference
LETS GO BRANDON BITCHES
If Britan was a Stellaris player and seen that America was at war and would of taken over before the Mexican war was over  “*its better it take those resources and keep them then having to pay for them eternally*” -Tzun Zu the art of space war
There’s nothing like watching a new oversimplified video.
Loving how the thumbnail is a recreation of star wars
White House the sequel
I seriously hope that ending is a joke. Edit: turns out it wasn't
I would rather die then be taken over by the US 🤢
fun fact: oversimplified has been on youtube since 2006.
send help I've watched this 10 times now
damn its 4# trending in austria  h o w
Insert Canadians making fun of America here
You don't talk about India (•╭╮•)
Mom come pick me up I’m scared
What if war really start it so America is now biggest country
what the helloversimplified
This reminds me of the French-Mexican war, which was triggered by an angry french baker and his cakes, it is known as the Pastry War.
That ending was so great
this was funny af needed that thank you for dropping this
I did it, I got Nord with your code
Damn, every documentary you come out with is just straight fire and facts, this is more lit than Chicago in 1871.
Your voice sir just got deeper than before. Why is that?
7:57
One of his best videos yet, always improves in every aspect
Seen a lot from this channel.. I don't get the very end. Also don't do the politics thing. Does Biden not like Canada? I guess I need to watch even more episodes for content. Fml
fuck yes. this video is punk as fuck
The "just as god intended" scene is probably the best recap of all American history.
I am not even American but now I want to join the American army and invade Canada
WHY IS NO-ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS MOMENT 7:57?? THE WAY HE ADDED "ALL-STAR" BY SMASH MOUTH WAS BRILLIANT!
I was waiting for Oversimplified new video months finally here
Very very great speech And make me feel in AMERICA
I think America should invade Canada and then give all their land to Ireland
The king is back
0:15 So cute!!!!
talk about asain stuff
38:16 we have already lost the war before it started. Knowing uncle joe, he will somehow manage to concede swaths of American land despite america occupying 90% of all Canadian population centers at the time of peace negotiation
A NEW VIDEO YESS
Still don't talk about Canada enough :)
7:57 All Star naturally started playing in my head
Living in whatcom county this was super fascinating. I never knew any of this.
4:10 that escalated quickly! 🤣
37:30 WE MUST DESTROY THE TRUE RED MENACE
man i was rotting for the canadians to win lol
This video will be looked back on with laughs in 10 years as the linchpin for the war which created Great Canada
You could release thar vietnam war right now . . .
Isnt Canadia protected iron dome styles by Ryan Reynolds? murica has no chance.

So I'm not the only idiot named Lyman that would make a 3 walled fence
5:00 The map on the table is of 60s south asia,  so.... The Vietnam war in next?
Hey OverSimplified, you can make war in Vietnam (1955-1979), I'm from Vietnam, hope you and your family are healthy and happy.
Heaven and hell are two very real literal places. And we all deserve Hell because we all have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23.) Nobody is righteous, nobody is sinless, and God will justly give us what we deserve by casting us in Hell for eternity where there is no rest. But even though we deserve Hell, God is still gracious and loving to us. He sent his only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to give us another chance. Jesus lived a perfect sinless life, He was tempted in every way as we are yet He never sinned. He paid the price for our sins when He was crucified and died a horrible death. Isaiah 53 says His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and His form was marred beyond human likeness. Jesus suffered to take the punishment we rightly deserve. Then, He was buried for 3 days, but He conquered death and rose again on the 3rd day. Jesus offers you the free gift of Eternal Life. He wishes that all would come to Him, and He will never turn you away. If you simply believe that Jesus did die for your sins and rose again on the 3rd (1 Corinthians 15 1-4) , and if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead (Romans 10:9-10) then you are saved. No matter what you have done, Jesus loves you, He wants you to accept His free gift of Eternal Life. Now, you're probably laughing at me right now and scoffing, but I only say this because even though I don't know you, I love and care for you. I don't want you to end up in Hell. You know in your heart that this is true, Jesus is Lord. Don't suppress the truth, your eternity is at stake. Please just think about it.   Revelation 3:20 "Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him and he with me." Revelation 22:17 "Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life."
Wow I'm literally learning this in my GCSE America: Expansion and consolidation
man, your ad transitions are getting better and better
oversimplied is just the best history lesson there is💪
still waiting on vietnam war mr. oversimplified, but take your time :)
7:58 saving for the fire cover
This has got to be one of the most high quality but also funniest vids you’ve made🤣
Joe Biden is coming to town
The ending makes me scared of OS for the first time ever, never knew that was possible.
If America did actually try to invade Canada then NATO and the entire commonwealth lion will do destroy america
Make a video on india 🇮🇳 pls  Btw love from india love ur content keep it up
I just love how Oversimplified managed to diss the whole entirety of America at 3:39
Every culture subscribed to the conqueror way of life back than. EVERYONE.
Awsome
"The only casualty of this pig war was, well, just a pig" meanwhile the Pig: Am I a joke to you?
“The ending was such a funny joke!” “Yes, a joke. Hahaha.”
I surprised when morgan freeman start talking
Me wondering: How many fcuking colonies did that little island made all over the world
As I Brit I’d hate to see canada get invaded. However being run by drake I’d absolutely be on the US side
32:46 to 33:35 lol
"I didnt say they were white ppl"😂
why was over simplified not a thing when i was in shool xD
Piggy
Why are you not talking about Israel?
You don't talk about India
"Lyman... shot the pig."  Best line I've heard in such a serious manner.
I’ve watched the ending too many times 😂
I think Oversimplified had a lot of Canadian problems the past 6 months.
Americans really think the war of 1812 was a draw? They tried to invade Canada and we held them off, burned down their White House and wanted peace? Fuck me 😂
Please make Spanish civil war next
Oversimplified is just history's Bill Nye.
OVERSIMPLIFIED DROPED HONEY
Iq
Remember Canada, you're never safe from America's futility to "unite" ALL OF EARTH!!
What about the potato. The only casualties were 1 pig AND 1 potato.
PLEASE RETURN!!
Can you do the great balkan war next!
I noticed that you became a lot more comedic and a lot less fact based
Canada is as American as the USA. You're both north American but I guess you get that name yourselves a whole continent cause manifest destiny
Best oversimplified video ever change my mind
Biden is too senile to do anything man, unfortunately that invasion has to wait.
#3 trending let’s goo
If there's a pig war part 2 i like to call it pig war strikes back

*"I'd worry less about Canada's curves and more about your own curves Benjamin"* 💀💀🤣🤣
As a Canadian, our go to counter for whenever the Americans mention invasion is "Don't make us come over and burn down the white House again. We did it once we'll do it again"
It has been ages since you uploaded!!! It's great to see you back!!!!!! Your content is better than Netflix!!!!! 😄😄😄
I want tall America
Biden be biden his time.
Please do the South African war or the second boer war
Me no longer doing history at school.... ❤️🚸
And so he uploads again. God I wish he would more frequently, but then I understand it takes time for this level of quality. Much appreciated man
" *I'd worry less abt Canada's curves, and more abt your own curves Benjamin* "DAMN
No, God oh please no!!!! I don't want to have to play 6 gazillions dollars for my much needed to survive medecine that I must taker every 8 weeks! Please America, save Canada from yourself! Does that even make sense?
That ending took me so off guard 😂
Suggestion: Do the great sparrow war next.
This video is probably the most extreme any youtuber has ever gone to retaliate against some mean comments. Declare war against a whole nation! lol
16:01 that american was a russian spy
I’ve lived on Whidbey Island just south of there my whole life and I remember learning about this in elementary school. We were basically just taught that it was a stupid war where only a single pig died and it turns out that was an extremely accurate description.
Oversimplified will you do the Vietnam War or the Mexican American War in the future?
idk if you will see this but id like to say im LOVING this style of video, a little longer, more theatrics and only just over simplified  as opposed to only just too cpmplicated :') i fricking love it and you for all your work, cant wait for more pins!
I will grant you three wishe I wish for you to be my dinner
We've got a crazy Canada at the end of our animation posted a day after yours. Interesting coincidence...or destiny... or something.
Can’t wait for the WW3 episode
Me gusta ver estos videos, aunque en realidad no los entiendo.__.
The ending was 🔥😂
6 months sure not every day but always top quality
Woah woah wish, I didn’t say they were white people. Comedy gold
The BAAAAA! segment had me laughing til I couldn't breathe
My favorite characters the are ones with the full beard and mustache.
I, for one, support a little pay back for 1812. How about we torch Canadian Tire Centre?
Winfield Scott also was in American Civil War video lol
The tourist boat “ Steamy Mcsteam face “ is a great piss take on when us the British public voted to name our arctic explorer ship boaty mcboat face. This guy knows how to add funny detail to everything
It’s here, IT’S HERE!
Ah yes, use your content to start another war so you have more content to make videos about. That's quite the 10,000 IQ play good sir.
Unexpected KSP music
"Get rekt" Bruhhh 😂
He finally started screaming into the mic and not just pretending to scream.
OVER SIMPLIFIEDDDDDDDDD
Oh my goodness I love your videos and u think the best when you gave that beautiful Patriotic speech for America! XD Look out Canada. XP BUT nah I love our Canadian Brethren and screw Biden! XP
let's invade Canada.
10/10 ❤️
Oh man. This Sure ist a good Video.I'm looking forward to the next one.     See you all in 6 months
As someone who lives in Montreal, that ending terrifies me
As a dual U.S. and Canadian citizen that last bit makes me extremely conflicted
1369 sheep *Laughs in New Zealand*
Neeeeehaaaaaah
Pigs find this video very offensive 🐷😂
Cover India too!!!!!
spspspspspsp
Finally NEW VIDEO FROM OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!
The ending has to the most chaotic and legendary oversimplified ending ever.
7:57 😂
Yes! Finally another oversimplified!
Biden can't remember what he said 5 minutes ago, much less invade Canada
New Upload! YES!
Think you may have gone a bit off the rails at the end there...BUT I'M ALL FOR IT! LET'S ANNEX CANADA!!
Please do the vietnam war!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The 'talking to the sheep' made me laugh a bit too loud, absolutely hilarious xD
Take that canada...
Finally!!!
what application or website do you use to make your videos
how do you make your videos they are very high quality
number 1 trending-nice
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life122
that took a sharp turn at the end there
Great video! Could you please do one on Rwandan genocide?
Don’t that pig look like waddles from Gravity Falls?
:O A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO? IS THIS A SIGN FROM THE BUCKET GODS?
Not gonna lie, the America conquering Canada map looks really cool at 37:25
A video on the Indian independence struggle please
Murica' FK Yeah!!!
Still waiting for Vietnam oversimplified
Ah yes. pickets charge. The most famous military blunder of the Civil War.
"Get back to me when it, uh, when it makes sense"
This is Great! You are great! Britain needs to stop oppressing us unfortunate Americans 😜🤪😜
If you watch last 2 minutes at least 12 times, your skin's starting to turn blue-red with white stars and your stomach starts to ache when you hear "eh" or "aboot".  Even you're not an American. For real.
Florida as the weiner never gets old.
38:10 "You mean to tell me that Joe Biden is going to SNIFF All the little Girls out here in Canada?"  "Sharpen your Chainsaws Boys and Girls, Ready your Hockey Sticks, Load your Hunting Rifles, Turn your Maple Syrup Bottles into Molotov cocktails, Use the Forests and Mountains to your Advantage, Cause Joe Is Com'in!"
Literally love this dude. Can’t wait another 6 months for the next lesson!
That is a great video on a war i dident know even excisted but what the f was the last
yooo!!!!
Both sides suck! I, an Indian lead my fellow Indians to war against Canada and America! IT IS OUR DESTINY.
I feel bad for the pig :(
It’s been 6 months
YouTube needs to unblock OverSimplified's Hitler video... He is so sad he mentions it in his every video... Justice for OverSimplified!!!
Best ending I’ve seen yet hahaha
Canada might want to be careful
3:33 MMMMMMM Florida
Weird to think a good chunk of bc was technically Oregon
Fun fact: Gretzky actually moved to St. Louis recently because he played for the Blues and for some reason decided it was a good place to live lol. I do live in St. Louis, so I can say with confidence it's pretty boring
Germans: *give americans the islands* America in the future: Lets repay in The Great War by attacking them.
Awesome. Just awesome. Happy to see a new video.
That sponsor transition was really smooth... just like the smooth experience when using NordVPN
Yoo!!! Internet Historian and OS collab would be fire!
You should do the Protestant reformation
We’re coming for ya Canada
Me, an American watching the ending: yes.
This is such a great video! Im watching it a third time!!??
The humour has been getting more annoying every next video
it's really cool to see some history about the north west represented for once.
Please make a video about how bad a President Buchanan was
wait ages for a video and then when the time comes: click click click
I did not see that coming
your impassioned peaches really are something eh?
Love your videos man
AY-SO UNCOOL! BUG OFF
This is a video about a boring event, a bloodless war btw. Yet he has made it 38 minutes 42 seconds worth of fun.
Nice ❤️...
I'm really glad you made this episode! As an American I always forget that at some point invading Canada was just like. An idea that miiiiight happen.
YEA TES YES YES YES INVADE CANADA
Ayo I think he’s americian
Was it me or was the pig Morgan Freeman???
I'm so bad at my job they're not sure if I'm working for the enemy or not
Man that was a fun and entertaining video
make the roman empire history this time
33:20 killed me
Bidens coming...TO SNIFF YOU!
Joe just Biden his time.
Oversimplified: do I want to make a vid about world war 3 or do a video about a stupid war and make it super high quality
bidens coming... lol
Warning the whole of Canada to sleep with one eye open was a nice touch.
this is just the best
Canadians: Looks like the Americans are onto us, but we got a plan....Listen to this: when they approach, WE RUN AWAY!  Also Canadians: Sir.....YOU'RE A GENIUS!
Absolutely love all of these videos. Almost makes me wish we had a bit more history in the world that way oversimplified had more content to make.
The BTS mention was spot on. There is ALOT of videos and we watch them all.
He just wanted his pig...
Pls oversimplified make a video about Indian history or Indian independence history with accurate details. Bcoz the way u r showing history is so clear and understandable. And people have a misconception that we won independence through peace. But the British pm Atlee told that the real reason they left india was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Not Gandhi. So please make a video about the real India not the India Britishers shown us to world
Pig voice= Morgan Freeman??
Baaaaaaaaaaaaa (this is the best video by far and it keeps getting better)
Greatest ending ever in the history of film?
That was the best ending out of all oversimplified videos
I thought this video was going to be about rival police departments fighting each other... Boy was i surprised 😂
“These white people sure love beavers!” I died
The ending made me proud to be an American.  Even though I'm Asian and never been to the US.
US—Canada merger would be an unchallengeable hyperpower.
the fact that this is #1 trending shows how much we miss you.
heart pls
Welcome back legend
Man in love with potatoes? Sounds like a Techoblade origin story
I swear to god I was just thinking about checking in on oversimplified today for new upload and I get this in my recommendation
6:30 exposed
Woah number 1 trending!
so were taking Canada by force this winter boys?
You should do a Spanish Civil War video
Banes and Hornby should have been impaled and burned for treason.
37:35 buddi... u.... u gud?
Sorry we provoked you to that, eh.
33:28 that was too funny
Please make a video about the 1812 war .
British dude: "Then you, my friend, should use NordVPN!"  American dude: "What the fu-"
The quality videos have gotten so much better. I remember watching the World War Two videos when they first dropped getting ready for my 8th grade test and wow looking back on it there’s so much more quality in these videos and the channel has grown so much. So happy to see the progress.
Maybe you should also try Indian independence movement in your videos..... and love your idea of invading Canada, Gosh those maple trees i can hear them chanting Allegiance to American soil....
darth piggus the third
Most wars start with stupid reasons.
Make a video about India's
whats the name of the song at 7:25 i completely forgot the name of it and it’s bothering me
I think you should talk about Canada more
DRAKE 🤣🤣
The end was *THE* most American thing
"But thousands of miles away, the people in power simply had more to worry about than some tiny islands in the middle of nowhere"  Thatcher: "You sure about that, Argentina?"
37:08
Plus Canada won war of 1812 we burnt the White House other than that plus you insulting Canada great video
Shoulda posted this on 4th of July. I’ve never felt so proud to be an American and Oregon citizen
they just get better and better
Bro this guy is the best
Best vid so far
Hey oversimplified I absolutely love your video.s! I want to ask you if you maybe could do a video about the rise and fall of the roman empire. It would be super cool.
Believe it or not Biden's foreign policies sucks. He is more likely to lose to Canada. 😘
is there another war about pigs that America had with Cuba?  because I thought the pig war was with Cuba for some reason and not Britian
I think he talked too much about Canada
Breaking News: Influencer dubbed OverSimplified spreads revolutionary ideas to America to conquer Canada using promising propaganda.
I swear this guy does the best nord vpn ads
wait, I didn't say they were WHITE people. ah, shit, here we go again.
Someone got their hands on some green wen writing an episode didn't they
Well, WW1 happened when a pig was shot so-

I am Canadian why did you insult Canada come on I loved your videos I wish I could un subscribe screw you
"Our glorious president Drake" lol
Next: History of Pablo Escobar
Be ready Canada!
War of 1812 next please cya in another six months
“Could [America] perhaps still invade Canada? Think about it. Why not? We have the manpower. We have the arms. It’s our Manifest Destiny! Picture a future where American Mounties wear red, white, and blue and hail the stars and stripes! Where Wayne Gretzky would wave the American flag every 4th of July in the streets of Montreal! Maple syrup, the greatestAmerican food! Banff, the greatest American national park! One united nation under the leadership of our glorious president: Drake! No longer shall we tolerate our smug neighbors to the north, with their affordable insulin, and endless comments complaining that I don’t talk about Canada enough in my videos! That’s right Canadians, watch your backs. Sleep with one eye open tonight because Biden’s comin’ baby! And this time he’s comin’ with a VENGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE!”  (upbeat music)
37:00 motivation
I feel like the reason there are months between oversimplified’s uploads is because his body struggles to contain his increasingly amazing humor and he keeps winding up in the hospital because of it
I've been fascinated by this war for years, I'm so glad you covered it!
Umm we can watch aaallll the bts videos ever from anywhere in the world. But surprisingly japan's got some exclusive membership stuff
We'll be ready. 🇨🇦
Holy shit I was not expecting the walk cycle at 31:35 it makes me very uncomfortable and I can’t describe why but it’s also hilarious. Overall though with the video, greatly impressed with the quality!
YES THERES ANEW VID
oversimplified, buddy, we all love guns, America, ruthless slaughtering of natives, but uhhh….. what the hell was that last part?
I love how in every video America is always the blue (good) one
Well ,Canada's gotta have Oil somewhere, right? The US murdered millions of people over less before.
Picket's charge - another brilliant move...he just could not stay out of trouble
I am in Indonesia
This is one of those YouTubers that you don't even have to watch the video to give it a thumbs up
So nobody ate the hog?
Oh s*** here we go again it's my boy oversimplified
im 9 and you should do jonn of arck or jullius caesar
Why did america loss the vietnam war even america is more power than vietnam
A truly amazing video. But, it’s just that American history is so dull. We want more and more Europe.
I never understood why American needed independence from the British weren't they just britishs who had been living in north america for a little while longer than the rest of britishers?
"The Pork side of the force is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be unnatural"
WE BEAT YOU ONCE IN 1812, WE CAN DO IT AGAIN! LETS FUCKING GOOOOO🇨🇦
7:57 Masterfully done! Took me a moment, thinking to myself, “wait… is that a Smash Mouth reference?”
Finally! A video after 6 months! 😀
It's pretty nice being able to identify the precise location of your house in an oversimplified video
Indian war next time
16:01 Why's he holding a Soviet Rifle? Smells like communist traitor
The 1812 War wasn't a draw. The two primary millitary objectives of the United States were to take over Canada and the Ohio Valley before wars end, and it accomplished neither. I loved this vid tho.
They aren't idiots
Wahhaahaa get f'ed Canada. ᕦ⊙෴⊙ᕤ
Canada is a bit too old for Biden
You be livin' your best life with this vid Oversimplified. This was pure gold.
Oversimp is back!
Babe wake up, Oversimplified uploaded
This whole video was basically just roasting Americans.
So the next videos will be 2 parts, I wonder what it'll be
Hey dued can we get a video on american mexican war plz
THE KING HAS RETURNED
Suggestions...war of 1812                            Boer wars                             Tecumseh's confederacy
rip his pig bro
HE'S HERE YES YESSSSS
Been waiting 6 months for you pal hope u be an excellent history teacher for idiots like us.
Manifest destiny is the exact same thing as lebensraum lmao
Returning Characters!  ლ(^o^ლ)
So technically 1859 was before Canada was founded in 1867..... when can we expect some Canadian content ;)
I remember learning about this in 7th grade and to this day I still remember a lot of that unit just because it was history that happened near where I live and not something that happened in far kff europe
I’m so glad someone decided to bring this war to attention. It’s one of those forgotten wars, and knowing that it was literally fought on my doorstep. I live two miles from Fort Vancouver baby!
Videos like this are a reminder that Americans have always been this way.
"THAT'S RIGHT CANADIANS, WATCH YOUR BACKS" Me as a Canadian pissing myself laughing at how drastically his voice changed:
Can you plz do a vid on the Mexican American war!!
33:29 This scene is awesome.🤣🤣🤣
7:58 keep coming
😂😂 love the ending
38 minutes of content worth waiting for
Joint Occupation?  Smells like communism  THAT'S NOT AMERICAN-LIKE OF YOU  TRAITORS
Make my day
Manifest DENSITY is hilarious
I did not expect the end 😂
7:57 good one
The greatest history teacher
Wtf did he just do a parody of all star LOL
As a Canadian, not at all upset with your approach to talking about us in your vids. To be frank, our national history is kinda boring, although there’s some hyper controversial stuff about it that’s not as nice to read about.  If your wanting an idea for a Canadian esq military event, do some reading on the “October crisis”, or a lighthearted one called “The Whiskey War(?)”, another territory dispute between Canada and Greenland for a ice island in the absolute middle of nowhere
“Could America, have invaded Canada?” “Man that sure is interesting but- *watches the end of the video* WELL WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY
I would LOVE to see some Roman or Greek history on this channel!!!
USA! USA! USA!
The end made me feel very freedom. Thank you.
Oversimplified- by oversimplified! Please make happen
I think your putting way too much faith in a barly alive president.
The end was hilarious he just snapped
I would sign up to fight Canada
I was expecting a "War of 1812 Oversimplified" teaser at the end of that rant :c
God bless America
That ending was sick lol
Man I missed this channel
This is the only channel I consider the sponsor sections worth watching lol
Where were you the last 6 months, eh?
This needs to be a Movie, holy shit.
FANTASTIC ENDING!
"The Pig War"  Hoo boy, here we go...
Straight line? Straight line 😂
Think if this ending actually start a war
The King has posted a Video. 👑
This whole video felt like one long fever dream, and if someone told me this whole story was made up id completely believe them
I think oversimplified is starting to lose it guys.
Finally
31:05 that Morgan Freeman voice is GOLD !!!!! Also, there will be tax for that....!
i love how the pig started a conflict
Wait was that Morgan freeman?
Man I can't wait for the glorious Drake administration.
What's worse emu war or pig war
Every Canadian lives in perpetual dread of Generalissimo Biden one day conquering our hallowed Canadian soil.
*Reverse card*
I find it terrifying how pumped I got to annex Canada after that end speech. 🇺🇸
Ok I know how you fell about Canada but what do you think of Australia?
They've gotten better every single time but this was on a whole other level of great
The end was beautiful
As an American:  I have never felt so insulted by something I 100% agree with.
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, HES BACK
I mean that ending is something I don’t wanna picture…being an American is not something I want
Peppa pig
27:27 The islands actually changed color, that's hilarious
This suddenly makes me wish we had nukes in Canada 🤣
"I didn't say they were white people!" American history in a nutshell.
Learning history this way is the best! This is funnier than some comedy pieces!!
Christmas comed early!
Go America
U-S-eh! U-S-eh!
You should do the 100 year war or Alexander the Great War !
The end of this video legitimately terrifies me.
Joe Byron is coming BAYBEEEE
Whenever a new oversimplified video pops up in my recommended. My day gets a little better
Have my dislike
Remember, the natives themselves also desired to "colonize" new lands as they originated from Asia. In fact, every single people migragated, and, or, expanded at some point.
It becomes better every video
FINALLY, AFTER 6 MONTHS ANOTHER EPISODE OF OVERSIMPLIFIED IS HERE!
To be fair I wouldnt' be suprised if Biden tried to start a war with Canada he's decended from Slave Owners after all. but as Stupid an idiot as he is he's a whole differant breed of stupid. Besides the Next Manifest Destiney won't involve Invading people's land it's gonna be colonsing a terraformed Mars or other planet. The only way I see us taking Canada is if they for whatever reason were to collapse or were dumb enough to start a war with us and we'd have to straighten them out. But what are the odds of that happening?
I double checked and gosh is it sad when stereotypes persist for hundreds of years. A bull-headed general, with authority problems, and scheming political aspiration. Hearing the description of Gen. Harney I said to myself, "I bet he was a registered Democrat.".... Once again it's sad when you can call it on based behavior.
Calling Americans rats and disease? Are you Canadian? WTF is this?
as an American, OORAH!
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 The ending is Pure Gold. LET"S GO BRANDON!!!☠️ 🇺🇸
finally
U are awesome
...      *Angry NORAD noises*
I didn’t say they were white people!! 🎉🎊🍾
37:08 we all have THAT uncle
Pig: "Lyman. If you spare my life, I'll grant you three wishes." Lyman: "Alrighty then. I wish that grass licked your feet when you walk on it."   Pig: *"Just shoot me."*
oversimplified never misses💯
Uh should I be concerned about that ending? I live quite far south in Ontario and I think I hear gunshots and the star spangled banner
The India revelutoin
I loved this channel so much, but since the creator decided to spit on America by calling Americans racists ("I never said white people live there" aka we can invade them since they're not white) comparing Americans to rats and disease (spreading to the west) and speaking about spreading to the west in pejorative terms (imperialistic ambitions), I have unsubscribed and will never watch this content again.  Such a shame that woke ideology flushed another talent down the toilet.  P. S. I'm not even an American, but I live in the USA and would be nothing short of PROUD to call this land my home. You should be ashamed of yourself, but since you've gone full mental and woke I doubt you even know what the shame is.
Thank you for a new episode. They are truly amazing.  My daughter watches them aswell.
That ending was gold.
Is the pig styled as Waddles from Gravity Falls?
100 dollars back then would be about 3300 dollars today
and about french canadian?
Two strikes - out! Un-sub, un-like. Go collect some money from for doing brown thing on white people.
Holy moly… he uploaded..
Fun fact:  Whatcom County is still around.
That was fuckin hilarious!
Lyman shot the pig.
Hello, mcfly
It is official. This guy has lost his mind because of the ending. After learning dumb choices in history, make jokes at perfect moments, draw so many unique face, and be demanded to do more history, he has snap.
3:36 ah yes, manifest destiny. One of the few things I remember from 8th grade
So when America invades, are the Canadians going to go: Eh sorry to bother you, but we ask if you could you please leave our country, nothing against you, but this occupation arrangement is making me sad.
The ending is for sure the best one I've seen from OverSimplified.
Good job on number 5 on trending I love your content
17:46 14:38
you are not wrong, america and canada should really be just one country. they are 95% similar
I showed the ending to my friend who is from Canada and she reacted by laughing while I was in the background going "USA USA!!!"
Oversimplified does not disappoint. Quality<Quantity
33:22 - "Alright you psychopath." I was LMFAO at that scene.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yo, could Canada and the US become one country though? Canadians seems so cool and I want to be friends with them.
ALRIGHT WHEN ARE WE HEADING TO CANADA IM PUMPED UP TO GO GET US SOME CANADIAN TERRITORY!
You don’t talk about Canada enough. And about taking over Canada I say, come and take it
I never knew he was American until this video I thot he was British or something
THE END IS GOOOOODDD
i swear this video kinda can trigger another war.
Hi nobody cares about nord vpn :D
Search the scientific name of a pig The Sus war
Look, oversimplified, I’d love to support ya bud, but you don’t ship to me
My wonder is how many techno fans clicked on this video
Affordable insulin 🤦🏽‍♂️🤯😭🤣
the sheep-talk really caught me off guard lol.
37:16
About if war began British force from Africa and Canada rushed US troop taking DC then US surender. It will be come New Britain and The British will strong in this era with alots of Nuke And super fastest speed GDP growing with out dept!!
I feel like the last 2 minutes was just oversimplified’s meds wearing off just going full America mode
I’LL EAT YOUR EYES!!!!
At the finally  Me:ummmm no buddy i mean calm down
hell yeah! let's go Brandon!!
The quality is so good
Ending made me so damn proud to be an American! 😤💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅  🇨🇦💥🔫💪🇺🇸 A new era of American imperialism shall begin! Screw democracy, let’s build an empire!
Sonic.exe:I AM GOD gallus: ALL RIGHT YOU PYCHOPATH I BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS!!!(pulls out an ak 47 sonic.exe:AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! (Gallus was introduce in mlp season 8 by hasbro)
You should do the Mexican vs American war
hey you know butter from bts
I love your videos
I love how in the end USA invade CANADA
The best video ending in YouTube history
I don’t know why but oversimplified found a way to make ever mor funnier and weirder this things that it was already typical oversimplified ...also make Mexican/American war please I have Ben asking it every video sooooo plssssssssssss do it for this Mexican boy that wants to know how Mexicans kicked gringos butt and then loose but that is other story so please do it
Radical feminist: "All men are pigs!"  The person who started the Pig War: "And all women are equal."
…  Straight line?
So oversimplified is trying to start a war to make an oversimplified video on the war....
this channel has potential
We comin.
Please don't make us invade Canada. I'd rather go back to Iraq, the cold doesn't suit me
37:08, Literally the best ending!
It’s literally insane how none of the videos on this channel have under 10 million views I wonder how much money they’ve made🤝🤝
Gotta love this animation
Best video yet 🤣
Me : History classes are very boring.  After watching Oversimpliefied: Oh wait what!
I was going to subscribe because you included Victoria (my home city) but due to the your rant at the end I will not.
Can’t wait to be drafted into Canada
Can you tell me the truth Hitler was hurting his bunker all the time along time agoAnd then he died
Finally, another masterpiece!
OMFG that final thing about America invading Canada I couldn't stop laughing XD
38:16 kinda agree with everything... besides biden. Us Canadian must merge with Americans. It’s true ive been celebrating 4th of july in montreal
Oversimplified. It's not like we've been dealing with a bunch of brainless hateful conservative idiots so uninspired that your satire might go over their heads and they take your ending as divine inspiration. Right ? Right ??  *Cue the Padme meme*
q
That ending had me on the fucking floor wtf.
Can we get one on the Pacific theater of WW2 or on the Vietnam war? That would be sick :DD Or the Chinese civil war or the Korean War?
lets go
wake up babe, oversimplified uploaded
this video showed oversimplfied americanness
Petition for Vietnam war
6:28 Well, at least they were honest.
AMERRRICCCCCAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yooo
American culture: Scamming.

THE MESSIAH HAS RETURNED, ALL HAIL OVERSIMPLIFIED
26:27 steam mcsteam engine lol
Oversimplified face reveal?

I love your videos oversimplified
Been waiting so long for this next video :)
This was the most amazing video ever seen. I love oversimplified so much. And I’m all for that American ending !!! That was awesome. Well done
Vietnam next??
Funny...everyone forgives what the Canadians have done till the 80s...
Did oversimplified just attempt to incite a coup?? 😹😹😹
The only context you need  31:01
Please talk about india next
Congrats on #1 Trending

Good gob man
Lol I love Americans so funny.
as a canadian I can say for certain ... as long as we get San Juan Island back we don't care
I will send the message to the rest of America to prepare ourselves for war
Steamy McSteam Face...I see what you did there
I thought he was about to freestyle at 7:56
I love how the top comments are talking about the end speech most.
So much expansion.   YEE HAW BROTHER!!! 🇺🇸😎🍔👌🏻🥓🍕🌭💸🖕
Seeing you throw this much time and effort at the Pig War makes me even more hopeful that someday we'll get "The Battle of Blair Mountain - Oversimplified."
Here to add my own comments, to this large and appreciative fanbase, that Oversimplified has shown, again and again, the best way to gain viewership [over 25 mil views in one day?!], even an obscure historical topic: Good research, writing and humor, presented in an entertaining and engaging way. In short, story and characters always win. Amount, short attention span lengths of content, notoriety, unearned or manufactured 'celebrity', the reality show pop culture reach for fame - success will always be fleeting and forgotten. Oversimplified, keep following your own creative muse, at your pace. Quality, that talent will ALWAYS draw the audience.   My own favorite tidbit, as a US Civil War buff, including Pickett's role in this earlier fiasco, a foreshadow to his foolish bravado to be his, and the Confederacy's, demise at the charge at Gettysburg, effectively ending the war there. Yes, history IS fun to learn, and re-learn, and even young viewers will watch 38 mins of it, when presented so well. Thanks for proving it with each video.
7:57 I've had to go back and re listen to that part over and over. Too good!!! 😂
Nah harney was based, The islands are ours Cope Seethe Mald Dilate
You know you’re having a good day when you open up youtube and see that Oversimplified uploaded a video
I want a second video please 🥺
*outro plays* Me: "well, that was a different ending" ... Me: *grabs flintlock* Me: *"But also, it was very convincing"*
Having been to Friday Harbor, I know how this story ends...but nevertheless, this will be a fun history lesson to watch, as always!
Who else noticed that Porky is literally the pig from gravity falls
6 months wait for another video is too long 😭 I absolutely LOVE all of your videos, and this one is no exception. Keep it up 👍🏻
So that's how it is, huh?
Well it finally happened. OverSimplified has finally snapped.  time to invade Canada
im down for invading canada. and the uk. and the rest of europe. they should already belong to us
I need these videos daily
Your spotted what?
Best ending
Not gonna lie this is better than those history channels that starts at 3:00 am
I speak for all Canadians when I say: Lol
I’ve fantasized about a new video 🤒😩
I am sensing a distinct anti-Manifest Destiny viewpoint here. Can't put my finger on why.
I love how OS used Minecraft sheep noises for the whole video.
Just for that ending... We won the ear of 1812 and we deserve those islands. Also stay the fuck out of my country and poutine is the best canadien food!
Can we all appreciate that oversimplified made a shrek reference at 7:57 aka All Star by smash mouth
Invading a country and connecting land that is separated by that country, where have i heard of this before?  oh right, Nazi Germany and the invasion of Poland
Welp.. that's all said and done . Time for another excruciating wait for another 5-6 months until the next vid .
the end was hilarious lmfao
That ending gave me WHIPLASH WTF JUST HAPPENED
So when are we invading Canada?
Do the Texas revolution
Bro got Morgan freeman on the pig’s voice
And the Grammy for best ending to a movie goes to.....Pig wars by Oversimplified!
This has to be the best one yet. Canada here we come!!!!
Finally another video after all this months
That ending can’t be topped
Bruh this ain’t fair
This was probably my favorite video of yours, mainly because I love seeing Americans poke fun at Canada. Since I’m Canadian.
I did the conversion on google, $100 back then would be over $3,300 today. All that for a pig. A PIG
38:13 nah jk he s asleep 🌌😴😴😴
I'm just glad this channel doesn't ignore or try to pretend the atrocities people did in the past were justified and paints them as evil and stupid as they were
You know oversimplified is an American patriotic when he rants how USA is able to invade Canada
"The Americans keep coming and they dont stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running"
We can all agree the ending was the best one.Ever.
MERICA
That ending 🤣
7:58 good one
7:57 nice all star reference
Where was this when I was in school? I learned more from a half-hour video than I did in 3 months of history class.
YAY!!! So Glad there is a new OverSimplified for me to watch 6 times in a row. Love you channel!
finally a new vid
8:49
Even though I live litrally opposite of America on the map, I can say that that ending made me want to eat a burger while shooting a gun.
Can you make a video on India independence
Why is he always sponsored by nord vpn
1:21 that sound bit for the comeback is a true classic
King 👑
Hands down the best vid from this channel i've watched so far. XD
Canada is scare after that.
Phillipines War pls
We dont need to invade Canada, we have Alaska.
I live in victoria so thats pretty cool, and basically every canadien high school learns about this war in grade 9, cool of you to cover it
31:05 this made me laugh
This video is just glorious and hilarious. One of the most American things I have ever seen. Too patriotic. I'm not even American yet I salute you sir.
The perfect Birthday Gift
at 3:33 anyone else have some issue with the placemen of Florida? although if that truley is america then maybe we have solved the mystery of florida man.
Is it racist to say I really love the anti anglo colonial sentiment?
Ahhh so that’s why Minnesota has that one bump on top 3:04
AMERICA FUCK YEAH!! WE TAKE WHAT THE FUCK WE WANT!
This one was so funny probably the funniest one yet loved it
I'm American but why am I mad that the u.s got the islands?
Canada would exist no more
Americans be like pull out gun when someone thertans them britsh wo ok we got to back up
Is it just me or did this guy's comedy get darker?
At last after 6 months there is a northern video
I have never felt more patriotic then i did from the ending of your video   USA all the way baby whoooooo!!!! 🇺🇸🌎🦅🔫
I like how at 7:57, he quotes All Star by Smash Mouth. I was hoping Shrek would pop up at that point.
Finally a new vid
As a washington boy this is really fucking funny to me
Man. Can't stop watching this
Brave for the US to eye on Canada right after the revolution, since Canada just went through a population boom...... of exiled American royalists. You know, the people that the new US just drove out?? Of course they said no
this is officially one of my most fav videos off this channel
This is the best oversimplified video up to date!
Why isn’t anybody talking about how Oversimplified got Morgan Freeman to cameo in the video 😂😂
Somehow he and his patrons would literally do something to declare war on Canada.
Can’t wait for drake presidency so I can finally become a certified lover boy
Nord VPN is British apparently. God save the queen.
One of the best animations yet! Too funny!
12:54 IM PERFECTLY STABLE YOU RAT BAG! CALL ME CRAZYAGAIN AND ILL EAT YOUR EYES!!! Arkham found one of your lost inmates.
that ending kinda scared me
Your back my love
Well he’s finally lost it
I think oversimplified is slowly losing his mind, this thing has so many random moments, like why is he talking to a sheep lmao  I love it
YES A NEW VIDEO
bruh
The best ending
You should totally make a video about the other axis members lives. You already got hitler, now we need two on Mussolini and Hirohito!
I personally look forward to when Canada finally joins the union and becomes a state
Hey at least they didn't starts war against flightless bird and lost it
Finnally
Dislike!
Alot of anti-America in this video
I’ve lived in the area all my life and I never understood why we had the Friday harbor or whidbey island, and now I know. Thanks oversimplified for helping me understand some more history about my state.
7:56 Started cracking up at that
Biden? You mean someone else? Biden is too sleepy to deal with wars. We know this because, HE CAN'T RUN THIS COUNTRY! FAILURE AT THE BORDER, WANTS FREEDOM BUT FORCES PEOPLE TO GET SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT, AND MUCH MUCH MORE! Maybe I can invade Canada....... Nahhhh, they're cool.
Hehe he said 69
Yeeeeeyyy new oversimplified, we are waiting for the Vietnam War
that ending was the greatest thing ever
as a canadian i can say that you guys invading is a great idea :) your clown government will collapse directly after and we can take it over from the inside :)
You had me at Maple Syrup 😂😂😂
would it be crazy if his ancestor was harney
Byron
MURDER MYSTERY: Who killed the pig and was threatened to be arrested?
This is 100% my favorite YouTube channel! Great work, always so entertaining and the highlight of my day
being a latino, the last part was absolute cringe for me I had to gave you a meaningful dislike
As a Canadian, I welcome American Invasion. Our rights are being taken by the government and a lot of us aren't too happy about it.
Omfg this ending xD
i love watching these video's honestly so happy when he makes them
best ending ever lol
Makes sense on why Britain did not like America, especially due to the American revolution.
That ending hurt my Canadian soul
Who the hell needs Christmas when you have Oversimplified posting
I am personally all for this invasion of Canada
For the last 8 months I have refreshed your page every day waiting just for this moment and I thank you
The thought of Biden starting a war with Canada makes me laugh.
14:30 best part
Do you ever like a video, forget you did, then go back to like it because it's that good
Please don’t give them ideas just leave Canada be, I would not like a nuclear war please😫😫
As someone who lives in Washington I can confirm also fun fact fort Vancouver is near a high school named Hudson bay
even if the canadians run to daddy britain, the brits dont stand a chance. and even if they do join the fight, whose gonna help them? europe? bet you guys regret brexit now, huh?
Skin Beavers, I must. Return the balance of the felt hats to beaver skin, I shall.
We can’t invade Canada. They are so nice and polite. It would be unseemly.
I’m definitely gonna be sleeping with one eye open
sad that im late but happy to be here
goddamit oversimplified, sneaking in NordVPN in the best ways
OMG
Drake for pres, baby
Why does the pig look like waddles from gravity falls ?
Not tryna be passive aggressive or somethin, but why does it take 5 or 6 months to make a video
YES WE MUST TAKE CANADA FOR OUR SELVES, LIKE THE GREAT GLORY OF OIL, THAT SWEET SWEET SYRUP WILL BE OURS (also that is the most hilarious change in voice, I have never once heard him speak like that for several years since I’ve watched this channel)
38:12 that felt like a death threat 💀
Alright, make this blow up, next July 4th, we celebrate in Canada xD
I always wondered where OverSimplified was from, now I know!
Oh my God I thought he quit ages ago
Is it just me, or are his videos becoming even more hilarious?
as a canadian i’m scared  😂😂😂
When Oversimplified upload new video: Me: *OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*
The only youtuber that makes advertisements watchable
The pig in this video looks familiar. Is that pig actually Waddle’s descendant the whole time? 😱😱😱
3:38 I can't even tell if USA saying density is on purpose or just a screwup
Comment section got me so hype for the ending that turned out to be just…     as marvelous as I was expecting.
biden wont do shit
As a fan of the Fallout franchise this ending left me quietly nodding my head in approval 🤷‍♂️
Everyone talking about his rant about the US invading Canada at the end but 33:20 is hands down the moment I nearly choked on laughter 😂
I loved the rant at the end lol. Keep it up you brilliant nutcase
HOW THE HELL IS TOMMYINNIT 1 ON TRENDING? THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Is it me or is this video the best show of skill in his animation
You have out done yourself! This was the best
Talk about Armenia
what did i just watch
Waiting for another video for months.... Amazing 👍🥳
Oversimplified, I would prefer if you dialed down the shouting and little skits. I still find it all funny, but in a high dosage like this, it loses its effect. Just keep a balance between standard lecturing, and funny skits.
So, Canada gives them most of their land,  America kills a innocent mans pig, American threatens canada several times, Canada just asks for one of the many islands, But America is too stubborn and had to take it.  Shame on those disgraceful men.
Oversimplified, that ending...you okay buddy?!?
I was like "There's no way it's THAT Pickett" I googled it. It's that Pickett. This man's whole career was having a superior tell him to go get blown up.
Awww so cute
The boaty Mcboatface reference did not go unnoticed. Well done
Loved the smash mouth bit.
Maybe one day the “Americans only think with guns” stereotype will go away  (Great video in any case👌🏼)
Finally you gave canada a spotlight even if you did it in the worst fashion. They should of won that war, stupid Germany can’t do anything right. The bad guys always win.
Someone needs to make a damn movie about this.
That is the most American ending I've ever seen!!! Love your video as always! Also, can we all agree that we need a Porky Pin ASAP?!
This is the greatest video you guys have done yet, well done.
babe wake up oversimplified dropped a new video
USA USA USA USA USA USA
Brilliant ending and an overall masterpiece
I love the McDonald’s thrown in with carriages and log houses
Careful with the invading Canada joke.  There are some people who would actually consider it a good idea.
Best Video
0:48 i almost frickin died there
I just learned about this stuff in school lol
Did anyone else notice the poster "Imagine" at 8:49?
That ending has me on my knees laughing 😂😂😂😂
When he started yelling about Canada I suddenly got whiplash  Who is this man? So patriotic and cool.
Imagine American actually invading Canada And oversimplified made a vdo on that XD
Do the gulf war 1991
Harney and Pickett are the type of people to invade Russia in the winter
'Murica!!!
Can you do a video on either the Korean War or vietnam
That ending...💥💥💥💥💥🎯👌🏾😂 I've been waiting 6 months for this video. Just in time 😂🎯💯 Good work
17:33 "Griffin's Pig was a Berkshire, well known for Rooting"  Some people from Australia watching this video: ROFLOLMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yo did you just declare war in Canada
I feel like Biden wouldn’t invade Canada but invade the United States to take our guns,opinions, and lick and sniff all the girls in America. Trump would be the right president to give the order to invade Canada.
5 trending
ok ngl the pig in the dress is unironically adorable
I wonder if Mexico gonna be next
The most American's ending ever, yet it's trending 1st in Canada?
Canada will win🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Dear Oversimplified: Bring it. You've never faced tenacity made flesh like Canadians fighting for their homeland. And you wouldn't just face our military. You'd have to dodge guerilla squads of sharpened hockey stick locals, out for VENGEANCE.  You'd wind up in The Vietnam War: Canadian edition. And Britain would 100% back us. As would almost every other UN nation. Because we're nice. So when the big bad asshole USA comes knocking, no one would hesitate to stand up for nice, decent Canada.  Just Bring It.
HE UPLOADEDDDDDD
I NEED VIETNAM
I am a simple person, I see oversimplified and I click.
I really needed a good laugh. Your call for an invasion of Canada is legitimately the hardest I have laughed in a while, so thanks for that. Also I’m behind it 100% 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Can you make the texas revolution/mexican american war
Man now would be a GREAT time for Honey to cover the financial burdens of the future war
Please make your next video on Indian Independence movements.
the quality of this channel is astounding.
14:28 The calculator says 5318008 🤣
This is the only thing that makes me never ending it all, waiting for oversimplified
That ending broke my spine.    *what*
Oh my god! i though he abondoned this channel lol
0:55  I didn't say they were white people Everyone: yeah 😂😂😂
This video was worth the 6 month wait
Finally a new video
everyone is talking about the ending, but great storytelling overall.  your clint eastwood references were not lost lol also, pig + wishes = genius.
It is a rare thing that something of such high quality can vastly outperform itself. However, in conclusion to the observations made here, the finale of this segment has justly been awarded an even more elevated prestige. In this, I will state the closing segment as "dope as fuck."
It's a good day when Oversimplified drops new vid.
This is the best channel ever made
Oh, I see.  So that’s how it is uh?  That’s how it’s gonna be is it?  That’s the way in which thing are eh?  That be how it will is it?  Will it be how that is huh?  That be the way in which things be the way they are?
Pickett’s charge was one of the worst military mistakes in history. Love how you pointed it out. Love your videos, great content
incredible content as always
Glad to see you uploaded
why is no one talking about 33:22
Can you do the history of the Japan province wars
That reference to All-Star, straight bars
This man can do no wrong
Really cool that he’s done a video detailing history on the Pacific NW, was funny to learn that Harney County here in Oregon is named after an absolute buffoon of a general 😂
1:25 they throw gang sings that was a sic burn
Pretty weird how the Brits did absolutely nothing wrong.  Funny how the US is the ultimate of evils.  Sad face.
TO CANADA!!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!1!11!1 gonna go take those curves
I'm 32 years old, born and raised in US and it was today, from this video, I learned that the white house is not in Washington state way in the northwestrn part of the country. Rather it is in it's own little city between Virginia and Maryland. Wow... I always knew about Washington D.C. being there but for some reason I still thought the white house and all that was at the Washington state capitol.
OMG oversimplified you havent post a video in like 6 MONTHS sigh
HIS GONE MAD MAD I SAY!
The "just as god intended" scene is probably the best recap of all American history.
Why are you all one to talking about Canada and not Mexico
You swine!!!!! no, the swine is the one I killed… I’m Lyman….. - ICONIC
Can you please make a Anglo Zulu war Video
Another great video. Almost 6 months of waiting for another video and it's reasonable why it took so long. Anyway, second time requesting for Philippine-American war. I wanna see what Americans taught to their children about it
37:09. That is all I have to say. 🇺🇸
Yay he uploaded a video
Maybe here in Canada, we just WANT you to think we're defenseless.  Maybe that's all part of the plan....
Canada takes as war threat the war of oversimplified
Animation is getting much better! Great video!
Ah... new baked fresh video from the oven..
That was the best ending to an oversimplified video ever
epic
ok, he's officially lost it
I love this channel like that Irish guy loved his pig! I just hope no one shoots you for eating spuds, or else there shall be war!
You should do a Salem Witch Trials
As an American, I can confirm America belongs to San Juan Island, not the other way around, so OverSimplified is wrong.
me- dad, if i score good marks, can you please buy me a car?  dad- that seems a completely fair compromise, and it protects the interests of both parties. AND THERE IS NO WAY I AM GONNA AGREE TO IT!
This was LEGENDARY
Biden is so incompetent that I don't think he could take Canada if he tried lol.
Such a great video, pls dont make me wait 6 months for another video
When he said "could it perhaps...still invade Canada?" I thought it's gonna be an opening for some kind of war game sponsor
I'm scared 37:13
I'm scared of you now. please dont invade canada. please?
Bro I live in Laos talk about Laos
Thanks the lord an oversimplified
I just sniffed a line of patriotism
That ending … I heard people talk about it in the comments and wasn’t sure when it was coming but when it did… I had a combination of these faces: 🤯🤨😫  The Napoleon one was cute because he was “definitely average height for the time” so I laughed.  But this one made me think “what did I just watch?” therefore this was your most memorable ending.
bro chilll
The more history Oversimplified puts out, the more it looks like the British are just annoyed parents that have to deal with a tantrum throwing baby America. Except the baby has a gun.
I love Americans
this video just make all canadian getting pissed by the americans
U should do indonesia country trust me
Um, about the ending... how about NO?!  Signed: Canada
4:10, LOL
That ending has certainly earned a Yee-  and I cannot stress this enough- Haw!!
Legendary beginning!!!
I also live in Harney County Oregon so yay William Harney
3:37 This is either a mistake or added on purpose as a joke
a almost 40 minute epic on a war almost caused by a pig? yes,yes please
How do you animate
I thought the ending was going to a sponsor!
Please not Canada.
just got the plushie ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つim happy
Make videos more often !!!
As a Canadian I feel so fucking scared
Oversimplified for president 2024 election
33:29 ALRIGHT YOU PSYCHOPATH
As a Canadian I can comfortably say that I'm not holding my breath
Peppa Pig be warring
So some morons going to start war cuz pig and potato
I'm Canadian and I'm pooping my pants rn
That ending tho
That pig looks like gravity falls pig
That ending brought a tear to my half American heart
America - the Motion Picture: The revolutionary war against the Brits. America - the Sequel to the Motion Picture: The pig war with U.S. and Canada squabbling. America - the Threequel to the Motion Picture: Alaska becomes part of the U.S., along with Hawaii. America - the Forth One of the Motion Picture: the World War happens with Japan and Germany. America - the Fiver of the Motion Picture: 9/11 struck the Two Towers and the U.S. into shock, along with E.T. on Atari. America - the Hex of the Motion Picture - the Stock Market Crash of 2008 happened.
Most american ending ever🤣🤣
Do you know if maybe you can do a mini war video or something like that on the Mexican-American war (even though you just did one on the USA) because it would be informing but it isn't really enough to make a full video off it -also you don't talk about Mexico enough in your videos-
As a Canadian, that last part made me laugh. Come get me
Taking over Canada would be interesting but not Quebec. Nobody likes the French so they can keep that lmao 🤣
HE POSTED AGAIN
Oh please don’t invade us we haven’t done anything wrong
Video idea: Chinese Civil War
Why did I think this was going to be technoblade related 😐
38:15 best part of the whole vid
That’s the most psycho he’s gone in a video at the end there
Now this is epic
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA BABY THATS WHAT IVE BEEEEEN WAITING FOR WOOOOOO
Dam 2 mil in one day 😳
He gets more an more out or pocket with each video 😂
You should do vietnam
Really makes you wonder whether American moral certitude, even today in our progressive times, is merited, and whether self-reflection and meditation might be long overdue for the culture.
America!
It’s been a minute
Canadians am I right mates
Lol biden's coming with a vengeance
yesss its back ive been waiting for 6 months
can you do the Jacobite uprisings?
Greatest ending ever!!!
Trending #5... damn
Our sweet sweet USA
You should do the Vietnam war
Hey man, I would like to say I am sorry before I make this comment, because I am a Canadian. But, amazing video, but the part about invading Canada at the end broke my heart, I am sorry.
Yessssssssss
From the first mellow-tone five minute video about the first world war to this exaggerated comedic dramatic 40 minute video about useless trivia made purposeful.
This is a masterpiece 👌
Upcoming: US-Canada War Oversimplified
I think it makes too much sense that the Americans just destroyed everything
In regards to the very end: For the love of Christ, don't give that potato any more ideas 😬
These are awesome man. Any chance of getting some ancient world wars? Like Romans, Spartans, Japan, Korea, Chinese/mongolia Greece, etc....
Biden is coming to have Canadian ICE CREAMS!!!
smooth ad transition
I’ve only been watching OverSimplified videos for about a month, and I’m already addicted. He makes learning so interesting and funny. Also, I think he should do the Seven Years War.
"Whether or not they kissed, history doesn't tell." 😆😆
OverSimplified is chaotic good
Logistically, if the us attempted a take-over of Canada, then they would get so many countries mad at the us, and joining Canada in efforts to fight the war
Just as humorous as it is informative!! Love ya man
This video is a gem
I like how, since their creation as a nation, american idiocy and firepower causes endless frustration.
16:27 Me when I hear the belt smack my moms hand coming towards my room
Now you need to do the war of the bucket
The return of the king!
Wow, this just paints the US in such a bad light, what the hell man. Seems about right carry on
"It.. was stupid." 😆😆
Ring ring ring ring banana phone...
U.S has 6,000 nuclear warheads
Maybe your best video ever! Well done.
Great nothern war
see you guys again in like 6-7 months
The fact that thousands of people could've probably died over a shooting of a pig is both sad and funny at the same time
Drake
Worst.oversimplified.EVER
33:23 is so funny
Nordvpn: let's support oversimplified
The CSS Alabama is a hell of a story. Honestly any ship blessed enough to have the name Alabama is gonna have some good stories.
What's with all the anti-american stuff like fighting over territory hasn't been a thing since the beginning of civilization?
This happened a day ago    HOW COME I NEVER HEARD OF IT
“It probably won’t surprise u to know Picket came  dead last in his class” had me dead 🤣
Sweden invades Norway England invades Ireland  United States invades Canada Germany invades France
Your back yaya
Porky plushy, little sisters or siblings of viewers would go crazy
The ending lol🤣
I adore that the ending of this video implies that if the US were to invade Canada, Canada would be the best thing about the US.
here´s a challenge for you. and a big one...  the Paraguayan war
"...almost brought two great powers to war..."  Not so much.  The UK?  Great power.  France?  Great power.  Russia?  Austria?  Great powers.  The US?  Not so much; you'd've gotten laughed at anywhere in Europe for another half century if you named the US a great power, when the US yoinked what was left of the Spanish empire in a stunningly one-sided war.
For a moment I thought that was USSR Ending scene
also make a vedio about india bro
man just sacrificed his entire canadian audience for an ending worth it
He’s finally made another one of these
TALK ABOUT BRAZILLLL
Canadians watching the ending of this video be like: 😐
WOOOOOOOHOOOO
37:14 oh my god it finally happened, we broke him.
Bidens coming baby 😂
I wanted to see that mole
I just realized that the thumbnail is like starwar
Being from the region I I never expected this topic to be covered by anyone outside this area. English Camp and American Camp are now both lovely parks on San Juan island. American Camp really is a very exposed area.
that ending was the best part of any oversimplified video
Did Morgan Freeman voice the pig? 😂
i go to camp in the oval lake
I’m bacccck-Cam newton
when hipster becomes too hipster
Ahem... as a Canadian, all I can say is this. You may have forgotten and that's ok. We are sorry for not reminding you, but we treat our friends with open arms and forgiveness and we treat our enemies with a bath of their soldiers blood. If you come, be ready for slaughter! Muahahahaahahah   (For those who don't get it, this is a joke)
To be honest I don't think biden would attack canada since he ended a war but overall good video
Bro I started crying when I saw this vid on my recommendation after evry day watching your vids over and over you finally post but I understand to much editing
I love how close this one is to my own American backyard
I'm sleeping with one eye open tonight

look at 2:13, the lake beside the moved Mississippi looks like a face, that's how stupid the line was.
20:07 Is it just me?  Or does it look like a person smiling on the American side?
Number 5 on trending
The pigs noises

We should have a Philippine Revolution episode.
When I saw this I clicked faster than Adolf’s father several punishing him.
Congratulations on #1 trending!
The talking potato
That ending. Fantastic!!!
Y’all Canadians better start runnin, Biden can smell you
Wow that voice turning to the dark side. So much rage and anger in it. It was just so powerful and glorious !  Best video i've seen in 6 months, the last ones being about Napoleon on this same channel. Why do you make us wait so long ? 😭
Youtube literally unsubscribed me from you, what the hell
didnt expect that at the end lmao
Dude this was so good
7:57 is that an All Star reference?
I wonder how many disslikes this video has...?
Alternative title: The Technoblade War/Potato War
Too funny.
7:57 is 👌🗿
7:56 "But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running."  Ded.
And then he pulls out an ak at least give him an m16
nah man, Super Troopers 2 already highlighted why America shouldn't take Canada.
What is the other guy in the end where the Chanel icon appear
Finally the god is back lol
Gotta love it
The most Legendary ending i ever seen

I really like the Star Wars type thumbnail and the quality video as always
Peak British empire: "we need to settle that land in North America for England. Quick! Send an Irish guy and a bunch of Hawaiians!"
Here i am,a brazilian watching a video of an almost war between the british and american over the shooting of a pig,all to end in a american invasion over Canada
3:36 "It's my density"
30 minutes for a an island and a pig the most amazing but stupidest video
It's interesting to think how if the Americans had simply agreed to the Brits perfectly reasonable compromise of making the border the Columbia River, none of this would've happened...and Seattle would be a Canadian city lol.
You Canadians thought he was jokin? Wait for the US-Canadian War, 2025 BE READY
This creator just loves taking Jabs a America.
from Canada: you had 2 chances already and you fked it up..... this time just ask and you may find we say maybe yes....... or NOT!!!! ....lol
I’m ethnic Canadian…     But I say LET’S FLIPPIN’ GO!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yeahhh the only thing biden has is a tumor and a unending covid lockdown agenda
Well done, OS. What an upgrade!
Sheriff Barnes calculator said boobies bakwards! 5318008 is 8008135 Lol!
i was expecting techno after seeing this title
27:27 Honestly I’d be livid if the US/Canada border looked like that too.
OMG that end bit was fantastic. Love your videos, man. Keep em comin!
Anyone else notice that they repeatedly use the Panama Canal during this video, which didn't open until 50 years after the events shown?
They ran out of snickers at the end there Canada sorry
Nobody talking about how funny it was when they barged out the door and started gunning down buffalos?
yessssss
The ending was so American, I stood up to respect the flag as my neighbors went gun blazing. *God bless America*
Hey Arnold
Im a simple man I see Oversimplified post a video I watch Oversimplified video
I love this video so much.
any canadian seeing the end: well mate, ya can come, jus take off er shoes , you guys can even get some health care for free, you seem to neet it so much

Look at Sheriff Barnes calculator 14:29 🤣
Holy carp 38:08
Truly a masterpiece
38:06 Let's be honest biden is to stupid to do that
Finaly, a new video is here
That British parliament part is actually pretty accurate.
The oversimplified plushie is kind of oversimplified ngl
This wouldve been a golden opportunity to revive “Mini-wars”
Lmao, that ending though even the Canadians don’t want to live anywhere other then the boarder, so let them keep their endless miles of nothing
3:33 lmfao florida is americas cock
Dude.  Just complete the fence.  What good is a fence with only 3 sides??!?
The rest of the video was fine, but then you ruined at the end. Dislike for you.
Finnaly a video thx
I love how oversimplified called sheep a "wooly cowards"
7:58 - 8:01
Today is a good day
Amazing
THE KING HAS RETURNED
As a Master's of History Student applying for his PhD whose hometown is Victoria BC, I salute you.   Fun facts bout British Columbia during this time period:  1. There were several gold rushes aside from the Fraser Canyon on in 1858. The Queen Charlotte's Gold Rush (1851) the Simikameen (1859) Rock Creek (1859) Stikine (1861), Omineca (1861), Cariboo (1862), Goldstream (1863), Leechtown (1864), Wild Horse Creek (1864), Big Bend (1865), Sooke (1865), and several others in this time period. James Douglas as well as the Russian Alaskan Governor made efforts to suppress news of the rushes.   2. These Gold miners (who were largely failed miners from the 1848/1849 California Gold Rush, and not JUST settlers from the Oregon Trail) were purported to be very aggressive toward the Native peoples and constantly tested British authority in the regions they were in (i.e. Fraser Canyon War). One time a judge had his hat shot off by an american miner's revolver, but he didnt flinch, walked up to him, and took his gun away from him.   3. The population in Fort Victoria swelled from just a few hundred to 20,000 within 2 months! This population shift essentially made many facets of life on the Canadian West Coast culturally American in everything. The China Town, San Fransisco-esque architecture and many other made it american in everything but name. (Ironically, it was the end of the gold rush that ended a possible American take over of the region, though this is speculation).   4. There was a very real chance of invasion by the USA during the Civil War (USA Politics were reflected often Victoria, with some shops and bars actively flying the Confederate flag in support, and one conspiracy for some Confederate sympathizers to steal some ships and raid coastal California).  5. African Americans found Vancouver Island very attractive and so many came up north from California as well to escape slavery (see his video on Civil War for the details on the politics). There is a legend that Isaac Mull, a freed slave, began singing gospel songs and one of the places near Sooke is named "The Happy Valley" because of it. There was also a sizeable contingent who would fight for the British should war begin between the USA and Great Britain, "The Black Pioneer Regiment". The Stark family, one of the oldest pioneer families on Saltspring Island, were african americans.   6. The "Fur Trade being interrupted" was true to a certain degree, but it was also so that the HBC could maintain peaceful relations with the indigenous peoples. Reflective of this, the lingua franca of the west coast wasnt English, but Chinook Wawa (words like Skookum are an example of this effect). Unfortunately, there was a sizable Smallpox Epidemic in 1862 that swept along the west coast and killed off many smaller or more vulnerable groups. The modern day Lekwungen / Songhees nation of Esquimalt were able to survive partly because they were evacuated to Discovery Island (you cant go there now as it's closed to the public. I went for a service project about 2013 and was even stalked at night by the famous wolf, Takaya).   7. The Gold Miners were so desperate for transport they imported Bactrian Camels from the Mongolian Desert. Dead Ass Serious, and it's incredible.   8. Douglas was nervous bout the Americans as his own hold over the native bands was tenuous at best, and hollow at worst. Fort Victoria was besieged in 1844 by the infamous warrior Chief Tzouhalem, whose favourite activity was to bind captives, march them up a hill, and kick them over the cliff. You can visit this location today at Mount Tzouhalem near Duncan, where ironically they erected a large metal cross.   9. BC was so bankrupt from having no gold (ironically) that they joined Canada in 1871 (4 years after Canada "confederated")  10. The province, British Columbia, is called that because it is (or was) the "British" side of the Columbia River (well until the Americans altered the deal).    If you are interested for more information, hmu on my insta! wildmanhistory :D
Best ending in any Oversimplified video 😂
I am American and I hate to say it but I dont think Biden has any idea what day of the week it is... let alone the guts to invade anyone
lmao lol
"Straight line? Straight line" is going to become a running joke of future videos won't it?
the ending was nice
No way
Poor Jeff
God bless that ending 🤣
God bless this sh*'t
2.6M in one day!!! ye durty dawg yeev dun ut
No mention of the Battle of new Orleans. Guess you read the cliff notes right.  So this video would be the cliff notes of the cliff notes?  The Battle of New Orleans, even though it happened after the treaty was signed, was the most important battle for the US in the war of 1812.  The British were not only wanting to take New Orleans but to take control of the Mississippi and thus restricting any further expansion of the US westward.
That was so long
i could not have enjoyed this more!
oh it's THAT Pickett?
Best YouTube video I’ve ever seen, and now I have to wait 6 months to see the only video that could possibly top it

You know, the last part was amusing

At the end of the video I thought, YUP he’s lost it!
After 6 months of silence...
WELCOME BACK !!
Good footage.  See you in six months.

Oversimplified in 30 years: That's how a YouTube video started a war between Canada and the US.  ... it all started with a pig.

As a vegan, I must say that the pig wasn't just a pig, it was a person.

Me, a Canadian:    Well this is awkward.
I'm sorry my map sucked. It was the best I could do at the time.
Breckenridge, James Buchanan's VP, would also later became a Confederate general.
YEEEESSSS
really thought we were getting Vietnam and although I really wanted to see that, this is just as good. Never in life have I known I needed something and didn’t know it until now
This, by far, is your most legendary video. While still being informative, it's use of insane antics hammered home the point of every topic. Good on you!
I think it’s the middle most middle of the strait
This video has only been out a little over 25h and it already had 2mil views
They are all Caucasian not British or American
I noticed that they're actually screaming lines now instead of trying to shout quietly whenever a character yells, and it makes it so much funnier
*How to fix any territory problems: straight line*

Oh my goodness, this his the most funniest videos

"I didn't say they were white people"
"War, over a small island in the middle  of nowhere. Over a pig and some potatoes" Not gonna lie, this sounds like every game of MP Victoria 2 ever.
9:07 Bladerunner reference?
I was curious if you could maybe do a animation of the stanford prison experiment??
Now do Canada's Independence. Complete the trio
That ending 🤣
Mole mole mole
Lol americans works freeze to death if they tried invading Canada
If America invaded Canada it would just need to divide it into fifty states, then we just fly two regular flags and call it even.
bro me and my canada boys would just give them some maple syrup and the Americans will just leave
That ending. Dang.
Oversimplified this is more history than history class

I like how much personality he has built over the time of this channel
36:57
That last part left me laughing for like 2 minutes good one man.
Yeay
This is awesome! I just started a college essay on the US-Canada border and this literally has all the early information I need for my essay! What a stroke of luck!!!!!
During the past 4 years I was honestly somewhat nervous that Trump would invade Canada or Mexico
That ending was so great. I feel like oversimplified got drunk and wrote that bit
Great end speech! LOL!
That USA/ Canada hockey team would dominate forever
Straight line?
imagine his neighbors when hearing him scream: BIDEN"S COMING BABY! AND THIS TIME, HE'S COMING WITH A VENGEANCE!
OverSimplified came back from the deads when we needed him the most.
Shoutout to all the canadiens, I know y’all see me eh
“Triggered by the shooting of a pig” Triggered by the stupidity of America more likely
Can you do a world war 1 reboot
the potato had Sonic shoes (also this was the best and funniest by far)
Heyyy said the Romans
4:11
This is the funniest one
as time goes on his voice becomes louder
The animation is great it have been improved 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Best ending ever
I still miss Sam o'nella
You forgot about all the booze involved!!!!  Lots of booze
Long live Canada
GREATEST ENDING EVER🇺🇸
Your 5th on trending as of December 7th, 2021 congratulations 🎉🎊🎈🍾
Oh my god. Finally. A new video
NEW VID yEEEE
I like how whenever two characters are arguing it’s usually the American that gets violent first
Pacific Northeast
This story was fucking WILD from start to finish..... Wtffffff
56 years from now, this man's gonna exclaim "Mom, I'm actually famous!"
We gettin our flag poll back
Oversimplafied then: What's the most American thing you've ever heard of? Chicken and waffles? How about math and science? Oversimplafied now: Woooohoooo! Baby! Were coming for Canada!
He should do video about video game wars and tv and movies wars
The ending is pretty scary, if you're Canadian
ok boyz expect another video in june 👍
what the hell happened in teh end of the video? Did he get a stroke???
36:52 This heartless bastard forgot about the potatoes.
this is his funniest one so far not to memie and cringey not to cold hes found a good balance
Yeah ok, this episode is the best one. I laughed my ass off more times than I could count in the span of 40 minutes. Better hold onto your poutine Canadians.. Biden is coming.
"One united nation, under our glorious president.... DRAKE!" Man that made me burst out laughing. What a great video Oversimplified.
im scared
As a seattlite it was super cool to learn more about the local history. I knew a bit about the pig war and but not to this depth!
WATCH OUT BECAUSE BIDEN COMING BABY !
That was the greatest ending you have ever done thank you for the idea of THE INVASION OF CANADA
This video marks the beginning of Oversimplified's decent into madness
my guy sounds like the commentator from sponge bob hahahha
make one on the mexican american war
As a Canadian, I feel insecure….
God do I wish that I had videos like this when I was in school to be able fully understand American history. Amazing work as always OverSimplified keep it up!
Finally the legend is back
I’ve been to fort vancouver (yes it still remains) and it’s quite fascinating to learn about early cascading politics
Without manifest destiny, lebensraum wins. Without a powerful expanded United States from New York to Hawaii, The us would never have gotten into World War 2 and the nazis would have won. Without the Stars and Stripes the swastika hangs from London to Moscow and maybe even America. Manifest destiny beat fascism. Capitalism freed the slaves
I was a lucy one able to watch the premiere from start to finish (26 thousand and something comment)
that ending was awesome
Ur backkkk
Legendary ending my guy
No one remembers the sacrifices of the 1999 US-Canada War. It was a terrible day for Canada, and therefore the rest of the world.
Thats imposible
22:55 may be the best oversimplified moment ever
Nothing better than seeing OverSimplified on the trending page!
we can finally unite Alaska with the rest of the USA. GOD BLESS AMERICA!
Biden, the guy who is as big a military blunder as Harley.  Ya no, the war would be over in a month, victory to Canada.  And the result would be a net 0, as Canada has ups and downs that don't match American ups and downs.
I could've learned this earlier bc we learned this in school a week ago lol
He's gone Insane
waddles gravity falls?
13:27 i died lol
30:55 im in tears
Cramming your agenda into this video at every chance you got. Couldn't just go into detail and history without it.
Cod wars?????
I hate Biden but that ending...   Gives me hope
I waited 6 months for this moment
Canadians: One eye open when I’m sleepin
What about the other part of America ? The upper part
i can tell you had fun with the ending
You should do the Hatfields and McCoys, it was another “war” that involved some sort of dispute over a pig.  Guess we all really love us some bacon.
I feel like you and zefrank1 should do a collaboration, for both are well known for their voices, and it would be pretty damn funny.
Man this is the most patriotic speech I've ever seen in my whole life
megafest destiny
MORGAN FREEMAN!?
Can we get one on the Vietnam War???
and he is back !
The Catholic church back at it again
I know this is all decently accurate based on his previous work, but by god this feels like a 40 minute shitpost and I love it
Will I show this in my US history class even though we're already passed WWI and WWI?  Yes, yes I will.
why does that dude at 12.54 likes eating eyes so much HAHAHA
F for the eaten potato
Please don’t make us wait 6 months for the next one :(  I have been in hell.  Next, Vietnam? Please. Thank you for all you do.
Dude you are amazing. Your animations have really improved over time. Keep it up
Thanks  Canada, you broke him lmao.
When we all expected the Vietnam war but got this and it’s better
The best was being American they pulled out guns.  And I loved the ye haa
Wait I thought oversimplified was British. Now I’m confused.
You might have united American to invade Canada of maple syrup
Pickett doing something stupid? Never heard of that before
Best part, the ending XD
Cold war closed beta.
Is this real or fake
It is not a coincidence that Harney sounds similar to carny
Its a great day when Oversimplified uploads ^<^
4:09 the most American and best scene in this whole thing 😂🇺🇸
Yeah...let's totally not talk about how horrible the Canadians were to the indigenous people too....history is ugly for a reason. We are to learn from it and never return to it....if we forget history we are DOOMED to repeat it.
that ending. . . WAS LEGENDARY ALL HAIL TO USA BABY!!!!!!! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
The vids get better and better
Oh man ! Please don't take too long to post the next video
Me working at my family's restaurant: Welp, we have had no customers for half an hour, I can eat my dinner! The entirety of the fucking United States: 7:25
Gear up boys! We charging Canada at dawn!!
Hell yeah
and we terrified one of your generals by walking and defeated you 2 times possible more
Ok. I'm ready for the war.
You got to do Korea or Vietnam next
the pig started speaking Morgan freeman
One United Nation under the leadership of our glorious president... DRAKE!'  Quality stuff.
I NEED THAT PLUSHIE
How about... you don't do that stuff? Please
He's back and on trending well done dad
This is truly amazing and I can 100% see why they would start a war over a pig ……….by the way great ending
you are so full of shit with this video.  Normally they are structured in a way where you provide facts and a few jokes and let us enjoy learning history.  More recently, especially in this video, you've formed a video that would be LOVED by democrats because you know the republicans are legit people who won't put you down for it.  Well it's about time I draw that line.  Every nation in history has CONQUERED another nation.  it's a fact.  get used to it and stop being a sensitive liberal.
I thought the ending was going to play into an Alternate History Hub plug but this works too
We're coming for ya Canada😈🇨🇦✖️
Fellow Canadians, Maybe we shouldn’t have angered him.
Title: The Pig War. Actual Title: The San Juan Debate.
What was that ending dude
LETS GO NEW VID
Good work buddy god bless you and thank you 😊.
That ending was amazing
We wouldn't invade Canada. The word I would use is liberate.
Hey, buddy. You ok? This video seemed a bit more...angry.  Love your work!
Great job....thank you.
Your best.
You should talk about the crusades next. I feel you would do it justice
Everyone: We want Vietnam War! Oversimplified: P I G
OMG!!!!
One of the best videos i've seen! LOVE IT
The thumbnail looks amazing
Based ending
Over simplified becomes American propaganda, CHARGE TORONTO
I’d like to see the states try to invade canada
"Banff the greatest American park" Grand Teton and Yosemite: Dude. Uncool
31:04 best scene in this great movie
That ending is easily the best moment in cinematic history. Avengers Endgame’s got nothing on Banff
I think America loves *STRAIGHT LINES*
Love how we are pretending that native Americans were not also stealing conquering land and resources before anywhite people ever got there.  People are horrible to each other no matter what color they are.  Anywho that's really my only criticisim.  I love this channel.
Porky had one of the most amazing character development of all time, the emotion, the facial expressions, no wonder they started a war over someone killing him!
Next time I eat pork I’ll be thinking “yk I could start a war rn”
I’m sure that this will be Picketts last military blunder for his career… I’m sure!
Best video oversimplified ever made
Hungarian - Romanian War next pls lord Oversimplified
Finally the youtuber I was waiting for
as a Canadian, I say we let our politically elected leaders box each other to settle the dispute
Spread and multiply like Rats or Disease? Self awareness much?
I really like how you draw the pig reminds me of Mabel's pig from Gravity Falls.
When are you gonna do the american presidents from oversimplified because i would love it
America: let's go make the world a better place.  Also America: starts shooting everyone and killing native Americans
Just the way he said "BIDENS COMING BABY" is probably the funniest part
The best oversimplified video I've ever seen! how the hell was this whole video so funny?!😂😂😂
I especially liked the ending. Sounds like a plan.
Is Canada going bye bye?
after canada, america will move on to north america
The best part is 33:30
I just realized that the thumbnail is a copy from Star Wars 😆😆😆
already rasist at the start
now this was a pig moment
I noticed you got the Kerbal Space Program music in your video.
Joe Biden is coming for Canada? Probably he is just gonna fart into Trudeaus face
Not enough mcdonalds' in the ending
But I think we can all agree that Rome Oversimplified would be based
Watch your back Canada 🇨🇦 😂
Can you do at sometime Spanish civil war? It's was a waste of lives and a testing camp, all together in the only way things happen there: in absurdity
How many times is it ok to rewatch this? Asking for literally every one of my friends
Comment for the algorithm
Can you make Mexico American war plz
Just a pig that can cause a war
I heard the part of Benjamin waiting Canada and as a Canadian burst out laughing.
This video didn't mention Canada enough, shameful
Wow!  That was an unexpected, but welcome, ending!
Next video: Vietnam War
I think oversimplified had a little too much caffeine when making this but I LOVE it!
31:10 make this a meme immediately
Oversimplified really asked someone to voice a 4 second clip of a pig talking like Morgan Freeman and its beautiful
Why do I look forward to the nord vpn sponsor so much
If you any more  weird war videos do The Pastry War
Bruuuhhhhh he finally posted
Sorry I’m just impatient sorry Good work
OverSimplified, your ptobably not gonna see this but is it pssoble for you to make a video on the Deluge? I think its a very intersting topic and more people should learn about it
Why don't you snuggle me that sounds kinda sus
28:40 to think that James Buchannan is the worst US president of all time, this is pretty accurate
Waddles❤️🐽
As an American the last part made me tear up
Anyone else hear the All Star reference?
Benjamin Franklin got roasted
32:45-33:35 Don't mind me, just saving the timestamp for the new best OverSimplified scene ever.
LETS GOOO, more Oversimplified!!!
Dont know why I always get upset everytime Brits lost against Americans.
If I were president I would have agreed with hardy and stormed the Pacific Northwest.
This Week in History: China: Soon We take Tiwan  Russia: Soon…Ukraine is ours…  Oversimplified: WATCH YOUR BACKS CANADA! BIDEN’S COMING BABY! AND THIS TIME HE’S COMING WITH A VENGENCE!!!!!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🎉🍟🍔
Great!! 👍😃
I am NOT canadian.
Next video: The American-Canadian War Oversimplified.
I just was looking last week for a new video. I was so close on the timing. Lol
kinda cringe ngl
Okay that was the best ending
But, what about Morocco oversimplified? Has to be American huh?
if America invaded Canada there would be a war of England Canada new Zealand and other close relatives to the queen vs America  and then they would lose horribly
Please don't give Biden ideas. xD
I know the pig war it’s the weirdest war in history
I love this.
i just realized new video
Most glorious video..... ever!  The end got me all, "Aaaaahhhhh!!!"
What in the world was that ending?           And yes, we should invade Canada
ive waited too long for this.
Last time you uploaded I was still working at Wendy’s
They actually talking about Canada, British, and America
Lol i love this i used to live in San Juan  and i would always tell people that where i lived had the dumbest war in history but could never really explain it to them thx for getting me a over simplified explanation :)
I thought I saw that pig somewhere else before, then I realized that the pig looks kinda similar to waddles from gravity falls, except a bit bigger.
GUYS GUYS NEW VIDEO DROPPED HURRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That cowboy animations is soooooooooooooo §møöťh
You know, the Hatfield/McCoy Feud started over a pig. 👍
Yeah I totally lost it at 13:03 Freaking hilarious lmaooo
See you guys again in six months
I missed you
You know what I like about water. It's pure. Powerful. And the furthest thing from arrogance. Wouldn't it be nice if the US just.... sank beneath the sea. XD
Why didn’t you upload for 6 months?
I LOVE YOUR VIDSSSSS   LOVE FROM TURKEY
I wish you were my history teacher.
You’re still inspiring me to keep going with my gaming channel.,!
They just keep getting better
World War 1 Oversimplified 13 minutes. Pig War Oversimplified 40 minutes.
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
No one is scared of Biden. But there is a great movie about a Cold War between the US and Canada called Canadian Bacon I recommend to everyone. It’s a funny movie. In the movie the Cold War we know between the US and USSR is over and America is looking for a new nemesis country and they settle on Canada.
Wow that ending 🤣🤣🤣
I am Canadian and can confirm that I am in fact chugging maple syrup and marrying a literal pig.
As a Canadian, if Biden is coming, I can't say I'd feel threatened. The man is so incompetent, I'd honestly just feel more intimidated by the idea of him ruling us than attacking us. Then again, we have Trudeau, so... I suppose it wouldn't be much of a gain or a loss.
We love our neighbors to the north.  That being said, watch your backs, of course Biden would have to figure out where Canada actually is first.
only oversimplified would be the one to rally a force to steal some maple syrup
Biden a okay president
The legendary Ending ever
I’m not democrat but Biden came with vengeance
Did he just answer a call with a hot iron 😂😂😂😂
you are doing the thing! You're awesome. Period.
Ahhhhhhhh he pumps the double barrel
I need to invade Canada now
Me when I get the promotion yyyaaayyy and then me when he stabs my lungs with the badge ooooowwwww
The Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. It didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon when America outnumbered Great Britain. Not even close it was 6 to 1. 6 with the Americans and the British with almost none. At this point the Brits were not having fun, but the situation was not even close to done.
So we gonna ignore how he implemented smash mouth?
"BIDEN"S COMIN' BABY, AND HE'S COMIN WITH A VENGEANCE!!!!"-Oversimplified 2021
Ok
I've got a taste for Canada now.  Oversimplified Louis Riel!  Do it!
Why did he shoot the pig
I missed 2318008 switch on the calculator on my first watching.
HES BACK
Those ad libs are becoming too much for me.
This has got to be one of your best videos to date bro. I cannot imagine how easily I would’ve looked the other way if they tried teaching this in History class
Yes.... pig
I demand more
Pig War I expected Ukraine
I just realize oversimplify uses Fable 2 music
Vietnam war?
I’m in ap us history AND ACTUALLY RECALL THIS NOW
I cried at the end
woooow, even the war is different in west. Here in east we can kill millions for an insult. Writing this from turkey. The country that always has crisis. Geopraphy is destiny. İ wish we had people with brain and they use it to stop wars for stupid reasons like who wears what or who speak what :D:DDD
What was that song he used for the Americans at 16:27?
"I didn't say they were WHITE people"  so true
Your videos are my favorite videos keep up the good work 👍
Pff…The us couldnt take Afghanistan  imagin canada 😉 ( to my américan friend from canada)
U-S-eh? 👌
Well guys see u after 6 months
The end of this video could cause a international crisis.
THE ARMY OF TEXAS WILL BATHE IN THE BLOOD OF CANADA YEEEEEEEHAW
4th crusade next ?
Friendly reminder, 0 wars were started from the killing of a gorilla.
Sorry oversimplified I can't hear you over the sound of my.... *FREEDOM*
I vote for OverSimplified to be the Monarch of the culmination of Americans invading the country of Canadian
Skin walker pig but it grants you wishes
omg
im canadian and i just listened to the last 2 min of this video
18:45 that's a double barrel shot gun so there should only be one click if he would need to arm the action, it's pump action shotguns that have the iconic to click sounds to them. Tho this is a awesome vid, I love the way u portray the Americans 🤣🤣
Harney, what the fuck.
yesss i love national emblem march lol
ooooookay....
you know if Canada didn't exist none of this would have happened
damn daniel ar ar ar
Can't wait for pig war the empire strikes back
You haven’t posted in moths!
Yoyo can you do Philippine History?
"Vice prime minister, Mr. Speaker, members of the senate and the house of representatives... Yesterday, December 11, 2021- a date which will live in the comment section forevermore... Canada was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the American forces led by the content creator, OverSimplified..."
I actually saluted during that “Invade Canada” rant. It was glorious.        Of course, I immediately stopped the salute when that idiot we call a president appeared, but still, it’s the thought that counts.
wow your animation is getting good like really good
it's really cool to see some history about the north west represented for once.
O yeah, 14 minutes of videos for Hitler and 38 minutes talking about a pig and potatoes.
Shoot y’all it’s ur mom war!
Can u make the history of the Philipines?
I can’t imagine U.S controlled Canada.
2:21 John mitchel has been real quiet sense this
Anyone else having issues getting merch on his site??
gg on number 5 trending
Ok now get to work on Vietnam
Was already thinking when there would be a new video
Something about that border dispute feels relatable at a certain sea right now.
So you see-Dhar Mann refrence?
Uh oh
Return of the king
Bruh clam down ov
Everyone in America: Canada is a good friend.  Oversimplified the last America still believing in Manifest Destiny: We must invade Candia and bring freedom to the Canadians. IT'S FREEDOM TIME!!!
I glad this video didn’t go of the rails at the very end
As a Washingtonian, I feel perverse pride that it ended up in an Oversimplified video.
i Love how the midlle of the oversimjplified the flower one
TRUE PATRIOT
Idea: Make another Channel and Do Alternate history for example: What If the South had won the Civil war?
As someone who has spent a significant amount of time running around San Juan Island, I was so stupid excited to see you do the Pig Wars!!! Ever since I watched your series of "mini wars" episodes, all I have hoped is for you do this episode. I have spent time just wishing that I wasn't so stupid broke so I could go to patrion and proverbially dump a truckload of money in front of your house to get you to make this episode!! THANK YOU!!!! In appreciation, when I strike it rich, I'll buy, like, 20 Nord VPN subscriptions or something
15:51 I love the nes controller in the background
I hope you do the golden age of piracy
Love how the customs officer was like "square up or leave" all Americans in the video were like that
WTF moment 37:13 and it is hilarious! 😂
Biden can’t even put a complete sentence together,much less a plan to take over another country, he can’t even run this one.
Dang now I kind of want to invade Canada
Me watching the end: w-wat have I just witnessed?
Burn
Oversimplified the king
Watch ur jet USA we will smoke u
Being Americans they pulled out guns on him 😆
Hornby is about the most logical person from the 1800s
What a banger!!! can’t wait for Vietnam
I love the ending, LOVE IT.
i hate that ending
Mans uploads after 6 months of nothing with a banger and is immediately on trending
You've convinced many Americans and Canadians to invade Canada.
I love the ending, LOVE it.
I honestly thought OverSimplifed would never post again. Great vids, keep up the good work!
Glubby Yanks.
Broooooo 😂😭😂 mobster pig
I'm canadian and I'm scared for my life.
Canada would be extremely hard to take over, mostly because of it's well trained troops and it's geography
I waited 6 months for a stupid pig war? The next video better be about a good war
Can you do the Spanish Revolution?
As a canadian that was the funniest ending yet, loved it
Lol, I gave you the idea without knowing you were already making plushies. Anyways good job oversimplified.
i love these videos there the best
Hold up, on the drawing at 3:34 what is Florida supposed to be??
I have a really strong urge to invade canada now.......
Yay
Yep. Everyone knows that it was the stealth bomber that allowed us victory in the revolutionary war. We then lost the civil war because the north had more stealth bombers. And of course because they are stealth bombers you can't prove different. Have you ever tried to find a stealth bomber? It is like trying to find a blue rubber ducky in the pool.
That rant at the end was the most powerful thing i've ever seen, lol.
Last part was epic.
joe..... joe Biden
Best. Video. Ever
The legend has returned
I wish he had done a video of Nepal-Tibet wat
Remember AMERICA is a continent.
Brilliant!! Thanks for the cameo😉
I like how pig mouth is- NOPE , THAT JUST EDUCATION ONE
Lmfao! That ending 🤣🤣🤣 best one yet 🤌
Harney woke up and chose violence and stupidity
15:54 Wait, look at the table, is that.... No, is that a map of Vietnam? IS THIS A TEASER!?
My god this is the best sponsor transition ever
OverSimplified never fails to amuse me
The most legendary ending in history.
Ohhh no 😧😧
I loved the ending it was perfect
The fact this was 1# trending in Canada lmao
Oversimplified is talking about how the war started because the guy shot the pig. He should really be talking about how it happened because the guy put his house on a pig farm and was too lazy to put a 4th side on the fence. Spuddy and the pig would still be alive if he wasn't so lazy.
May I assign this video as homework for a 5th grade class?
it was funny how you had him pump the single shot rifle
Manifest destiny
ONE OF THE BEST OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do you think you’ll make more videos sing
Straight line? Straight line
"Well, I'm off to invade Canada. They've had it too good for too long." - Norm Macdonald
This was a amazing episode and now we are all sad to wait another 6 months. Keep up the good work tho, the wait is worth it
Different ending, war breaks British sends 50k regular troops and Canadian militia are brought up to hold Canada, the American army is actually quite tiny and the navy ranks around 6th in the world, smaller than Denmarks. . South says what a great time to succeed.  The Union loses the war and the US is no longer united. Canada takes back the island.
Ecclesiasticus 14:16-20 Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave. All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death. As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born. Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the worker thereof shall go withal. Blessed is the man that doth meditate good things in wisdom, and that reasoneth of holy things by his understanding.
hey you should do an oversimplified video on the Mongolian empire, it'd be pretty interesting
straight line? straight line.
Can you do philippine revolution please
The way his voice changed so sharply from history teacher lecturing to terrifyingly patriotic American is both concerning and glorious.
37:12 loved the crossover collab you did with Alternate History Hub there
I didn't know General Harney invented the banana phone.
Far and away the greatest oversimplified video. Not even a contest anymore
Who else is working really hard on their channel!
Idea, Give San Juan Island to the British, Give rest to the Americans.The closest way to cut the Islands in half
The ending was terrifying, but considering that we live in one of the coldest place on planet earth 6 months a year and most of the USA are in warmer climates, all we would need to do would be to wait out the winter. Also, did no one realised that the pig's voice sounded just like Morgan Freeman for a moment in that flashback?
i'm glad i waited 6 months for this masterpiece
Is anyone else interested in the war of 1812? It’s like the big war that a lot of Americans know almost nothing about myself included. When I heard about it in middle school I was like what! “The British burned down the White House!” “But I thought we already beat them.”   Haha Idk there has to be plenty of interesting stories in there. Our national anthem was written during it. I mean hell it’s the only major war I can think of that we didn’t even give a real name for it. Just the year it started lol.
Having grown up in western WA, I actually own a coin commemorating the Pig War that mentions the "Great American victory of the San Juans". I like this version better.
you don't talk about canada enough
Gotta give props to whoever made this thumbnail
Someone watch this man don't allow in a room by himself
Annex Canada you say? *fallout theme*
The Canucks will be too high to even notice. It's a perfect plan.
You out did yourself on this one my friend. Amazing job!
BIDEN'S COMIN' BABY, WITH A VENGEANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The war of 1812 wasn’t a draw, the Americans attacked us Canadians and we beat them back.  The US lost.
Seriously they had to give it to America?  As a American British should had gotten the island.
Nope I'm out of here
Can you do the Mexican American war?
Who awakens the beast?
…did he just suggest America go to war against Canada? and call Canadians pssies? The ending was so inspiring
Best video yet, keep up the good work!
Is it just me or does this video seem like most high quality oversimplified video ever, like seriously!
not a call to arms against Canada oh god
this mans really trying to pull a South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut
You sold me on it, all I want for Christmas is the annexation of Canada.
Oversimplifeid you good? acting a bit weird
Best ending ever
One of the best ones so far xD
Man, I really like your channel! Keep up the good job! :D
For the love of God, please make the “making the world a better place” at the 4 min mark a gif
Am I the only one who looked up theses islands ?
OK an ironic fact I just found out while looking at the Wikipedia of George Pickett. After the Civil War he feared prosecution because he was a major general for the confederate army. In order to escape prosecution he ran away to... Canada. He hid out in Canada in order to prevent himself from being arrested. Ulysses S. Grant interceded on his behalf though and he was allowed to return to the United States and live out the rest of his life back home in Virginia.
As someone who actually lives in Whatcom county today and being an oversimplified fan for just over three years, it was a very nice surprise to see a video about local land!
best day of my life
Been following you for years and I want to say thank you for all you do and that your work is amazing!
As a Canadian, I shouldn't say this but I wouldn't mind US merging with Canada (and having American Maple Syrup) IF it becomes a video content for Oversimplified.
poor pig :(
I love this man
im canadian im offended lol
the goat is bac
I never thought going to Google Maps would be a spoiler but here we are.
When are you going to do the balkan wars???
Biden going to war, what are the odds of that ever happening?
I eagerly await Covid Oversimplified, explaining how so many governments made a big deal over this weak virus and how many people protested world wide over these mandates.
Wow! Why are we going to war over a pig again?
That is the most American ending I've ever seen!!! Love your video as always! Also, can we all agree that we need a Porky Pin ASAP?!
As a canadian... this end was...  a end i hope was true!
This series gives me hope that this country of anti-intellectualism and anti-truth will rise above its collective ignorance. Some hope, not much tho.
Unfortunately too long for the subject, and the jokes and theatrics aren't nearly as funny as I remember from years past. Appreciate what you do, though.
18:17
Yo Technoblade was in my history books! Wow!
Despite how silly the whole war of pig was, I actually found it quite interesting.
If Biden is coming, he's having 27 potty breaks before reaching the border.
OverSimplified! Oh boy!
That ending was legendary 😂
Uhhhhh the ending kinda weird Biden coming for Canada ? No way !
You can tell he had fun with the ending
33:30
33:29
Loved the ending
I'm fairly sure the annexing of canada was something america did in fallout, so clearly it's not the most out there idea
the American guy needs to be a twitch emote
An invasion of Canada would result in 10 new states, all accustomed to single payer healthcare and gun control.  This would be a massive shift in the voting demographics and wholesale change in federal political power.  It would have some pretty crazy impacts.
JOE BIDEN WILL GET THE VENGENCE!!
He’s back
I like Piggy and Spuddy.
Thank you 2 year edit: I can't explain how often I've been trying to decide something and "Straight line? straight line" pops into my head
The ending was beautiful, perfect and glorious
This oversimplified video is so different from all the other ones and the editing is amazing.
"American Quebec" sounds even more cursed than the normal one
Papi simplified upload reallocate all resources to watching video
At 14:28 don't read what is on the calculator upside down.
i still dont understand why he didn't mention canada
You should do the French interventions in Mexico
ayeee
YAAAAAY
Oversimplified Anti Canadian? Must have been fun to record that audio
Petition for Vietnam War
SUPERB!
we shall take what's rightfully ours from the Canadians. God bless the US of A. Amen.
i love this  btw- you should make a vietnam war video.
I'm a Canadian and right now, I'm seriously scared
Fun fact: Pigs roll in the mud because it cools them down during hot days, its a survival mechanism. Remember that next time you think pigs are just dirty animals.
POG
They teach about this in schools in Washington. I've been waiting for the vid for years.
Man never fails to impress me
That ending deserves death sentence ngl my g
Oh I'm sooooo gonna snugle u XD
As a Washingtonian, this one’s personal…
Well the end was... Interesting...
The Drake bit was funny since he's now 35.
New upload things you love to see
LOL 😂 @37:09
Just when I thought you couldn't top yourself, you do so!
Did you notice that reference to all star at 7:58
Had to check out Charles Griffin (I like to compare the creators caricatures to historical photos) and that man is HOTTTTTTTTTT🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gosh I love the animation
this was to good man [insert emoji].
new vid
Go ahead and take Montreal yeah. We hate those guys
finallyyyyyyyyyyy
I swear these videos just keep getting better and better!
31:10 MORGAN FREEMAN is that you
ok btw im pretty sure if america attacked canada-the un would attack back
do the spanish wars of Independence!
About time I slept with one eye open.
I'm surprised the British agreed to allow Germany of all countries to arbitrate the dispute.  The US is on the other side of the planet, and poses no real threat to Germany. Meanwhile, the British are next door, command the greatest navy on the planet, and pose a much greater threat to Germany. Of course the Germans were going to side with America.  The US could've sent a pig to make their case, and still would've won.
“Oink Oink” Famous Quote From Pig.
I loved this video
I never thought I would've like studying history until I found this channellll its awesommeee!!!!
37:27 I’m very sorry and afraid
HES BACK
This is perfect.
Seriously the best channel on YouTube. You should get your own Netflix Show. I love these videos.
I thought calling it the 'pig war' referred to the greedy white guys involved in the war.
Thank you oversimplified
You need to run for president. lol
100/10 video and ending
Best ending ever
33:29 I'm dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  19:00 You. Did. WHAAAAAAAT  32:30 TikTok:
i am canadian and i will soon nuke america after canada comes to my rule HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
A historical lesson about an almost-war _literally turned into a Manifest Destiny campaign at the end_
Court Marshalled 4 times Still a General...  Yep, that's America for you.
I love how genuinely concerned Pickett looked with Harney's lunacy
Love your content(:
That end took a turn…   100000/10
Do the Pastry War next!
Honestly given how well the government up there is doing I'd like to think more than a few Canadians would welcome us.
👍
I like how the ending starts like is going to be an advertisement suddenly becoming a call to annex Canada.
15:48 hint at the Vietnam war next?
‘I’ve been moving calm don’t start trouble with me’  - President Drake negotiating with China over Taiwan’s sovereignty
You know, if the United States was to invade Canada, we would probably just walk in with the military and annex it without any use of force. We totally could, I mean, why don’t we? We could just walk into most countries in the world and just, colonize them. Colonization, when done ethically, could help the world. I mean, when every countries America, American jobs can’t go to foreigners right?
9:06  The last thing I expected from this channel was a Papers Please reference, this video rocks!
I love how even back in the day British and American stereotypes live up. From the british putting wigs on people to make them magistrates to a simple customs officer being decked out in as many guns as they could carry.
Oregonian here. So we have a county in Oregon named after Harney. Harney County is in southeastern Oregon. Sorry for naming our county after an imbecile…
the writing and animation on this channel is going through the ROOF baby!!! <3
That ending was the best never expected that keep making good vids
That ending was the best never expected that keep making good vids
Very Bruh
love the ending
3:32 Not only did america grow the west, but also something else😳
When will you give us Vietnam?
You didnt actually say Canada that much, you just put the American name/flag on things that are Canadian.
1369 sheep? Nice
History has never been more entertaining. Great video
I love you
The hero has come back HOORAY!!!!!
Peter why did you start a war about a pig? -Lois Griffin
When the people BAAAA'd Lmaooo
I live near lake of the woods on the north side. The best side.
He has spoken! Let’s invade Canada!
This is a really good one I really liked the last part
Fun fact: cutler ate the pig but then realized spuddy was inside the pig and killed himself for eating his dearest potato
lol the ending... first of all, usa will get into more debt. secondly, uk will join the war and make usa more in debt. thirdly, nuclear warheads would also destroy usa if they tried to send it to toronto or ottawa
THE BEST VIDEO, I EVER SEEN
NordVPN go brrrrrrr.
If the USA invaded Canada I would move to Sweden.
I think this is the most emotion I have ever seen from you, keep it up.
Just in case there actually is a Canadian scared of Biden: don't worry, he's not your president yet and if you think he could actually lead an military force to do it, you need to use your free health care to see a psychiatrist.
7:37 i see what you did here hahaha
The bad thing is we have to wait another 3-5 months for the next vid
The most American thing ever 37:19
Neva
That ending tho haha
I think I want to invade Canada now
Alalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
The return .... of NORD VPN
Christmas has come early!
Alsla
Simp this seems fake I know it’s real but it sounds like a story that a British man would make up to keep land
I agree on the idea of invading Canada. 🇨🇦💣
29:15 Lol
Jizzinhham lmao
Charles Griffin: the original Robin Feld
We Germans decided in your favour.  Kaiser: Man, they owe us big.  General: Don't worry Sir, I'm sure they will help us if we have trubles with the brits in the Future.  WW1: Yeah, about that...
Okay the ending was hilarious 🤣 going from cool, calm, collected to LETS INVADE CANADA!! Never fail to deliver on content
Congrats on #1 trending mate
President Drake
yooo
How did a war almost start because a shooting of a pig eating a potato
oversimplified explains history in a funny way that what’s makes him special imao
can’t wait to get that plushie!
Did you really end this with "bidens coming with a vegence?" lmao...   The weakest man on earth isnt invading shit.
16:01  isn't that a blasphemy, an American using AKM
Line Is the main character
BEST VIDEO
I saw the thumb nail and I dropped everything to watch it
Let's gooo, new video.
I'm Canadian. The ending started making me nervous
FUCK YES I LOVE WASHINGTON
Well to be fair my people have fought a good dozen or so wars with the French on the basis of "I can't understand them and I don't like them"   so the killing of a pig seems still like a better reason than most German-French wars had   (I mean the war of 1871 was literally started by the French feeling insulted by a piece of writing by Bismarck in which he purposefully forgot to translate the rank of the man that met the french ambassadors as the french had a similar sounding name for a rank far lower than his actual one and thus their population felt so grievously insulted by their ambassadors being received as guests of honour that they forced their government to declare war against all better knowledge over it, despite their entire military not even owning a single up to date map of German lands past the river Rhine)
YESSSSSSSSSSS a new video
Haha, piggy
This is the greatest YT channel, well, in _history_
We need more post
18:35 I just truly love how the Hawaiian dude just laughs at the potatoes being consumed by the pig 😂
Thanks you
They just keep getting better and better
I question where he finds this historical story
just lol
Damn Canada must be shitting it's pants
Basically a reminder of the issues with westward expansion The Military was more in charge then the government
That was mostly lame until the end  But Canada and Mexico likely won't exist by 2100...I do think the American Empire is coming.  The Romans eventually swallowed up the Greeks who so much of their culture was based on and I think the Anglosphere will fully reunite all territories. It's the only way to fix all the problems and prepare for China
I died laughing because of the man speaking with the sheep🤣
I don't think I have laughed as hard as I did with the bit about America invading Canada at the end, in a while
This is almost as good as that time America almost went to war over a tree.
Interesting ending.
6 months of waiting were worth it
Finally he is back
Probably my favourite episode yet! Very well done!
I loved the parts with president buchanan!  “oh no mr president. not the curtain again!”
This has got to be the most unique and exaggerated Oversimplified video yet
I love how Oversimplified reintroduced who Winfield Scott was for people who forgot about him from the civil war
Bruh u know u a good YouTube if you have 5.6 million subs and post history
Is there a part 2???
Canadians watching the video when they started getting on to the ending: Wait a second
Next video, when?
“Wayne Gretzky wave the American flag every Fourth of July” best line just because of the Wayne Gretzky reference
FINNALY A VIDEO, how long has it been? IDK THIS IS POG
That was something
I honestly would be very pissed too to if someone decided to kill my beloved pig
LMFAO at the end
32:46
That took a while to get a new video out there
Keep up the good work
4:06 God bless Merica 🥺
Perfect. That’s all I say
That ending was the most American ending ever.
Therapist: "Don't worry, Imperialist Oversimplified isn't real, he can't hurt you." Imperialist Oversimplified:
Can't believe that a war was cause over a pig.
Bruh
What the f...............
Please do the 17th Century crisis
As a Canadian I am now very scared
Why not?  Mmm probably because most of the world would probably side with Canada since America would be the aggressor.
The last part though best thing ever
I vote to have a remake of Hearny the 7th there not enough six songs in it
Should of landed the troops
Has oversimplified ever posted a video that didn’t end up on trending?
At this point, I just want to hear this beautiful man’s voice say “you naughty naughty boy.”
3:34 Florida's placement is unfortunate
Vietnam war?
America is very frustrating.
Isn't there a video game series on why annexing Canada is a bad idea?
Go ahead invade, you'll all bitch about the cold and go home before we have to lift a finger.
This video has the best ending in YouTube's history.
Ayyy
This is the most epic video ever
I bought a plush Oversimplified figure. But why not make a plush pig?
7:26 16:28 My favorite 😂 NOOOOOOOOO
this is your best video yet
Thank you for the great video
I should send that ending to my Canadian friend
glad to see the british parliament has yet to change in 100 years
Voice change 0.0
Oversimplified, indeed...
7:58 love the “Allstar” by smash mouth reference there
Fucc yeah!!!
See the joke is Biden can't win a fight with his bed.
Does the potato now make Civ6 let’s plays on YouTube?
😭😭😭😭😭😭
i like how lyman was  too lazy to build a fence, but had enough energy to chase away a pig
Bruh
not only was this inoframtive... but it was godamn hilarious
Time is limited for you Canada, the day you join the U.S grows ever closer. EACH. PASSING. DAY. IS. NUMBERED.
So that means oversimplified is American?!
the king is back
Wow, I used to live close to the Lake of the Woods. I'd never thought the small lake would ever be mentioned in an oversimplified video. Can't wait for a video on the war of 1812.
Can you do the Vietnam war
3:32 The US gaining Florida is... unfortunate for this animation.
You teach me better than my history teacher
our glorious president drake? we’re screwed
I instantly missed the old "owhh noouu" 😥
The youtube video war - Coming soon
HE UPLOADED
I thought you died
When you started talking about USA invading Canada I thought this was a transition to some sort of mobile game sponsorship. Well... preaching a war with so much passion certainly sounds better in my German ears.      It's a joke guys, calm down.
Best channel on YouTube
7:57 lmao all star
MANS REMEMBER THE PASSWORD
I love how we said biden coming baby when he probably rather give territory
Bro!!!!! I miss you so much man! Never ever go away for 6 months at a time. I need some oversimplified!!! Super happy for this video!
I was literally dying from the ending      Like the pig
This is the most high quality video, great job and please don't stop.
Plot twist: oversimplified is planning the invasion of Canada so he can make a video of it
31:02 did he actually get Gordon Freeman to voice that line lmao
Invade Canada? Not a chance! All we have to do is sit back and watch your American troops die of frostbite.
13.28 is the best timing in the world
Best oversimplified video EVER. You rock
You know what...this doesn't really seem that "over simplified".  This is way more than I ever learned about this in school.
Plot twist oversimplified is canadian
Unsubbed for shitting on white people constantly.
LOVE
Prediction: The Goat War in Ecuador.
Super down to invade Canada after that
that ending tho
Can we get the Mexican revolution oversimplified?
Please someone tell me how I know when these are coming out
I think we should manifest Destiny Canada.
What
As a Canadian, I am deeply frightened, especially hearing about how shit it is living down south of us.
American soldier: So you know July 4th is coming up. That is the date where we celebrate the fact that we kicked you off our land despite the fact that we were a tiny little group of colonies at the time and you were the world's biggest super power ... British soldier: Ahhh ... American soldier: Anyway, we are having a big party with beer and hookers. You wanna come? British solider: Then maybe you can come over and celebrate the birthday of the monarch you fought so hard to get rid of? Both soldiers: Best occupation ever!!!
As a fellow Canadian, I did not like that ending.
If you seen British politics this scene is just so accurate. 10:24
Fun Fact - British "Rear Admiral Baynes" was a veteran of the War of 1812, the Crimean War and the Greek war of Independence, he even started his career as a midshipman while England was still at war with Napoleon all the way back in 1810, this was undoubtably one of the less interesting moments of his otherwise exceptionally exciting career.
Who would dislike this wonderful masterpeace
You are my favourite Youtube channel! Love from Spain.
HE’S BACK ❤️❤️❤️
just simply amazing. one of my fave videos uve done so far.. hilarius too 😂😂😂
Manifest destiny
*(Meanwhile in NATO)*  Turkey and Greece: WE ARE ABOUT TO GO TO WAR!  Oversimplified: IT'S TIME TO INVADE CANADA!!!  Turkey and Greece: Jeez dude, chill for a sec.
This has 269k likes and 2 dislikes. That's pretty cool.
He finally returned for a great video

Was that actually Morgan freeman?
Punishing someone because he broke my rules 33:29

The best ending to a oversimplified video ever
Lol I just had to pause @ 19:14 to take a moment to say I genuinely appreciate your work and I hope this channel never stops putting out this top tier content.
Holy shit that Drake joke at the end killed me
1:54 so bri'ish lmao
What a fucking mood
Over simplified I want to make a video using your clip of we can invade Canada today to make a funny little YouTube video for my channel so can you please give me permission to use it I will give you credit for the video and you yourself and all have links to your channel and the video that had the audio
You know everyone loves you when you post your first video in over half a year and it gets over two million views in just one day
sad to see how the channel deteriorates. try hard jokes, cringey overdone sound effects.... anime faces? classical sellout, guess thats wut happens.
The voice in my head after the somewhat patriotism inspiring end of this video (screaming at the top of my voice):  Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: „In God is our trust;“ And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
WATCH OUT, CANADA! -Biden
War is like politics, a bunch of idiots fuelled by pure motivation.
New oversimplified..... Yeeeeeeeesssssssssss!!!!!
YAY
Our lord and savior has returned
I kinda want to see Oversimplified do a redo on World War 1, just to see what Random facts he includes and to shine light on the African and Asian fronts of the war
BIDEN’s COMING BABY
When the world needed him the most,  he took 4 months to prepare
I swear I'll more here than in any history classes haha
"White people sure love beaver"
As someone who lives only an hour away from the Columbia river, I will never be able to drive by it again without seeing that Brit shaving beavers into hats 😂😂😂
Dammmmn
Next you should do Michigan Vs Ohio War. Basically about how Michigan and ohio wanting the toledo strip, then a bit of war, then Michigan getting the upper peninsula.
7:57
At last, he returns
Fuck, man, you manage to one up yourself every time you upload. Great visual gags in this one.
"sharing is caring" America: *loads gun
OverSimplified is the Beatles of YouTube
finally a new video
Absolutely fantastic again. I'm a professional editor and these are beautifully put together. Do you animate and cut yourself?
Who laughed at the end of the video ?
Yk it’s a good day when Oversimplified posts :)
HES BACK
The pig reminds me of gravity falls for some reason
wtf
Would love to see the gulf war or Iraq war nonetheless great video tho
Seeing the Republic of Texas on a maps makes me shed a tear 🥲
You are so freaking funny dude. I can watch your videos over and over again. In fact lets invade Canada in Power and Revolution, shall we?
That tyrate at the end was glorious
Oversimplified after creating history: 💵💵💵
"I never said they were white people" lol
If you invade canada we french people get to keep Québec right ?
I’ve already watched this video 3 times, it’s one of ur best
Oh no, somebody call the doctor Oversimplified has been infected with 19th Century Imperialism!
God has answere my prayers
No way dude
As a canadian, im only accepting american occupation if Oversimplified get his pig killed by a canadian.
Where did u goooo man. We missed you 😥
He came back when we needed him
As a Canadian I scream HELP!!!!!!!!
For context $100 in 1850ish is about $28,900
Yesss he’s back baby, every time I worry he’s gone he uploads
nice
🇨🇦⚔️🇺🇸
You're not dead!
1:34 and that's still true to this day
Holy shit he got political
yoo oversimplified do what u do best
Vietnam war next???
The animation style is truly reaching its peak.
“Maple syrup the best America dish” Me a New Yorker whose state tree is literally the Sugar Maple:  :/
Why was it a draw??????? Ohhhhhhhhh,,,,, France (Spain and the Netherlands) was dealing with their own problems now, considering Napoleon had a major hard on for Russia, there was no way they could expend aid or manpower to the states this time. The USA was on their own. OOOOOOOFFF!   USA lost their muscle.
5:52 The very first, and possibly only time, where a character in an Oversimplified video reacts with shock at an advertisement moment.
Some missed opportunities; you could have done some callback jokes as well (such as being punished severely).
Bidens coming baby with a VRNGANCE!
I accept your challenge on the behalf of Canada 🇨🇦
Finally after 6 months
Is that pig…Waddles?
Oversimplified is Canadian, the Patriotic ending was just a ruse to throw us off. I'm on to you mister.   Edit: Also Greater America < The Canadian North American Empire
I love America
when history students needed him most  he returned
Btw can’t wait to see lukashenko oversimplified lol
Alternate title: “We should invade Canada”
Face reveal if this video gets 600k likes
Biden's coming baby!
To finish this off, Canada isn't good enough for USA, and additionally, sleepy joe doesn't know where Canada is at this point, so an invasion is irrelevant right now... Guess we'll have to wait til 2024 when we get the real prez back and then maybe consider that option.
Finally a new video
16:02 not Evan a American gun
Nothing is more American than people settling to new territories and bringing MC Donald's with them
The best thing about this channel at the moment is that, since there aren't that many videos, you can watch it rapidly decend into madness and chaos with each video.
Sorry my uncle is Canadian but GET REKT CANADA
Dear Canada,  WE ARE COMING 👽🛸
Blame Canada!
Put your clothes back on honey, a new OverSimplified video just dropped
22:36 - "Historians still contest exactly what it is I'm trying to do here"   this entire bit was the best part of the video I was dying of laughter
Always a banger
Do you guys have a place where you list sources? Thanks!
I like how you made a video talking about US-Canada border disputes without ever talking about Point Roberts.
3:55 one of them saying "I hear voices all the time"  😅
Vietnam
I don't need sleep I need oversimplified video
Indepedence 0:59 legend
When the world needed him most he returned
How about the English Civil Wars as the next episode?
Please don’t invade our country
And if I’m french? It’s ok?
Fun fact: As a Canadian, I can confirm that Hudson's Bay Company still exists. It's stores are in basically every mall in the country.
That ending was hilarious 😂😂😂😂
What is the name of the background music during the sponsor section?
When oversimplified uploads
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO AHHHH
Omg, finally new Oversimplified video!
Looking forward to the 2022 North American Conflict video
At the end, why’d I sad laughing. I’m Canadian. What am I doing.
FINALLY!!!!!!!  ANOTHER VIDEO!!
You can make talking about a pig interesting
It’s so funny
Me waiting for the Vietnam War👁👄👁
Once again British wtf do they want? Sharing something that ain’t there at all? Really? Ok let’s go share Britain now. Who wants part of the Britain ? Dude how can you decide or share something that doesn’t belong to you? Your home is in Britain so go sit there and live there. You don’t have any rights over another location.
As a Canadian, your video earnt one big fat dislike, and unsubscribe from a Canadian viewer. You will also be reported to youtube. Unacceptable
Germany a real one for that on god
Straight line🤝straight line
The ending really got me, if that happens then Canada will most likely end up being like Taiwan or something like that... Wait... What was Taiwan again?? I don't think it's a thing...anyway
7:57 nice reference
Where has this man been?
Heyyyyyyyyy my man, so. You decided to make a video on the PIG WARS, but no Vietnam war?
14:03  As an American, I can confirm this is what we do when faced with difficulties
BEST VIDEO TO DATE!!!!!
*sharpens frozen maple syrup icicle* Cowabunga it is!

We need vietnam war!!!!!!!!!!!!
One day, we will have Drake as our president, one day...
are we canadians really that bad? like we are the nicest country to the USA so why invade us? when we can just give it to you as a gift of honour
today is a good day
So, where do I sign enlist for the great oversimplified offensive into Canada?
babe wake up, new oversimplified video dropped

I don't think I've ever laughed so hard when Scott beat up harney, that scream almost killed me
Pickett is Ian McCollum

5:56 cleanest cut i have ever heard
Me being an European, that last part was perfectly fine and normal
HYPEEEEE
Please do Chinese Civil War, Seven Years War, or Vietnam War next
I wish the ending really did happen already. Im not joking. Lets invade Canada.
Technically, you don’t have the manpower. Canada is a dominion of the Commonwealth, formerly known as the British empire. Which has a population of approximately 2.5 billion people. Most of those countries would most likely answer the bell in defence of Canada. Although technically, her majesty is only commander in chief of 15 of those nations. Mainly the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Which in total, combines these 15 Commonwealth realms’ populations to just about 150 million people. Half the population of America.
The pig war? Isn't that also known as Angry Birds?
the moment he said "selling my data" i knew what was happening
I was not expecting that ending lmaooo
I’ve been waiting for this moment
YYYEEEESSSS NEEEEWWWW VIDEOOOOO

This is the cause of the 2022 Canadian war
If Biden is coming for them they a Have nothing to worrie about

School: Me falls asleep after 5 minutes of anything  Oversimplified: Me watches 38 minutes if a war almost started by a killing of a pig
Hey this might be a weird request but it would be cool if you tackled some fictional conflicts, like the human-covenant war from Halo

Yep, America has a checkered and imperfect history, a history WE HAVE YET TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT TO HELP THE PEOPLES DISPLACED BY MANIFEST DESTINY  Note: This is only my opinion on the matter
glorious thumbnail.
The ending was blessed.
Finally a new video! I was tired of replaying the napoleonic wars part 1 and 2 again and again!  Edit : Don't know what you took when you made that ending, but I definitely want some
Probably the best video to have ever been made. I love it 😂
“Then why not snuggle... ME!”  Oversimplified -2021
I feel like the drugs kicked in too hard during the making of this video... 😀
This is the most funnyist video yet
Yes
I just realized  that i wasn’t subscribed  Either that or its that youtube glitch that every youtuber talks about
Now i want to watch the Chinese Civil War made Oversimplified
THOSE DARN NICE PEOPLE UP NORTH!!!!  (That was a joke, I love Canada)
i cant wait to see the political arguments in the comments on that ending. good video!
Next please Vietnam!!!
welcome back
33:52 that was the funniest moment
16:01 Wait that's an AK-47. A russian asault rifle(I think asault rifle) made by Mikhail Kalashnikov after The Second World War.  Very American I might say.
Okay this is the best one.
PLZ DO VIETNAM WAR
I liked the ending
Was not expecting that last part
British: You are currently passing on the BRITISH territory American: Bu- but  American: BAAAAAAA British: BAAAA
Thanks to oversimplified, I now want to be a history professor
38:12 bidens coming? He's so dementia ridden that he'd probably give up a couple of states to Canada
"Hey what province do you live in?" "oh yeah I live in  R U P E R T 'S  L A N D"
33:20 still has me laughing
Ah yes, the best reason to invade Canada, because why not
less go new video
That was a fever dream can't wait to see what comes next
I love this content keep it up
@4:00 I thought it was Sharon’s cat...
If you need ideas to videos then would it be awsome if you did the whisky war
Do u hate America or sumthing bruh like damn
Always great to see the greatest channel on YouTube posting some utter brilliance
Alongside Historia Civilis THE channel im actually excited for whenever a new video is posted!
3:33 the ever so careful placement of Florida
I love how Charlie's cameo there was so sudden but so recognizable.
Yes
Why does *Porky* look like a black version of *Waddles* from *Gravity Falls?*
Still disapointed about the lack of Canada
But the american keep coming and they don't stop coming got it in their wagon and hit the ground running noce
PIG WARS: The pork awakens Revenge of the swine The last skytrotter The bacon menace
damn daniel ar ar ar!!!!!
Liked the video till the end about canada then it just went downhill
It's really reassuring that 150 years later the Americans learned their lesson and appoint more level headed officials.
woah that was epic
Yayyayyýyy
4:15 This is America
USA USA USA
I love how completely insane the last two minutes of the video were
I love how in the ending his voice gradually becomes more and more American
Waited 5 months for 36 minutes, 100% worth it for this amazing vid
oh
They left it to Germany to decide?? What????? Why???
Speaking as a canadian I gotta say lay off the pipe with that ending LMAO. Joking aside there is several more Canadian history that u could do like the Rupert lands war, the Turbot war and lastly the Northwest passage.
W America baby
And with that OverSimplified goes into another 6 month sleep
33:28 I am gasping for breathe with laughter😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
AHHHHH
Yeah I’m pretty sure that the US will not invade Canada just because of the simple fact that congress and the the executive branch would have to both agree to go to war over a ideology that happened years ago
That certainly was an ending to remember. 10/10
HOLY SHIT HE POSTED
I LOVE OVERSIMPLIFIED but why don't they make more videos more often
The madman is back
hes back
Kerbal Space Programme music!
That’s such a messed up part of Canadian history. Wow, good job on explaining it! 🇨🇦 😘
“I kind of just killed your pig.” *”So you’ve chosen death.”*
We need The Vietnam War OverSimplified
He’s back!
🐔🐻🐗🐺🦆🦅🐷🐮🦊🦖
YESYESYESYES!!!! I've been waiting for a new video soo much, i was cheking your channel every day, and FINALLY
Oh Canada! So Vol-up-tu-ous! Really should change the 1st line of our national anthem to that.
Do paraguay war
Jesus his voice changed so much!
Not only did I learn something today, I laughed out loud for the first time in a long time!
Yesss he’s on the main trending yessss 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I mean over half your population basically has one foot in the grave already so if you wanna reenact 1812 again im down
Really bro. All this time waiting for a Vietnam war vid and you go for a war over a pig
Next time let hear about the American Mexican war
For the NORDVPN ad he should of said to watch squid game instead of "watch every bts video"
It’s called *Manifest Destiny*
Production quality went up a notch
You mean europeans
'And I don't want to catch you using my computer and selling my data to advertisers', don't worry they won't tell you when your data leaks, just like last time ;P
Can you make a video on the Mexican American war? And also great video
7:57
You arrived just when I needed you🥰
Fun fact: the Panama Canal wasn't built until the early 1900s under Theodore Roosevelt, so the ship delivering letters animations would have to be altered to go around the South American Continent.
I love this channel, it states everything in a way that is easy to understand and is funny and entertaining
and thats why we should always be quiet about canada
Biden’s coming baby
i like how every time oversimplified makes a video it is on the trending page
"Maple syrup, the greatest American food" -Oversimplified
The Greatest video I have ever seen, best part is the last 30 seconds about Canada, But your forgeting the slap shots.
"THE ASSAULT ON CANADA BEGINS NOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS BRING ME JUSTINS HEAD" Joe bidome
18:44 I think he hired somebody for this one shot..
dude stop 38:18
Did I hear KSP theme music?
# 3 on trending! Good going oversimplified guy!
Biden’s gonna be in Florida thinking it’s Canada
Bro you should do the Mexican-American war plz
FINALLY!
Actually read about this a few days ago lmao
I think OverSimplified wants to invade Canada.
Very epic
7:57 OK that Smashmouth reference was funny!
I have the slightest suspicion that you may be Canadian sir
FINALLLY let’s goooooooooooo!!
7:59 that subtle All Star reference
The Pig War, not to be confused with the Bay of Pigs War
23:05 Obviously he got him the flower because Harney asked him to Pickett
Mexico earing the last part: uh ouh...
Was Morgan freeman the pig?
He’s back
Thank you for including the war of 1812 in this, this is my favorite video yet, and I never complained about Canada not being mentioned, but that was pretty funny.
I’ve been waiting until people realize that Canada was essentially a corporate country for a while now.  the Hudson’s bay company was so important that it owned over half the land.
I love the ending
Just watched this in history class at school
This is probably the most chaotic video Oversimplified has ever created. Keep up the good work!
There is going to be some idiot some where who will think the US is going to invade Canada now,
That last speech was awesome 🤣 MURRRRRICAAAAAAAA
took you a few months
Me, an Australian watching 37:11 without any ties to America:  LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙 USA USA USA USA USA USA USA👨🏼‍🦼👨🏼‍🦼👨🏼‍🦼👨🏼‍🦼🪖🪖🦅🦅🦅❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙
3:33 america got a dong
It was a good speech, but you'd lose that war if you tried...
the last part about invading canada had me laughing the whole way through, good stuff oversimplified
Breaking news: Canada has started mass militarizarion  Reason: Angy american in a video where a pig got shot
this is hands down the best channel on this site
As a canadian that ending was beautiful
Finally!
That plushie is so f*cking stupid. I'll take your entire stock!
Lol I’m Canadian
Im not a big fan of history but god i love to watch your videos
Can you do Yugoslav war please?
The videos and narration style were always good, but it’s clear that you never became complacent and kept working on improving both; and it shows.
Love to see you back!!!
this is so iconic that you can show one pixel and everyone will know what it is
That first joke was perfect!!
He's back at it again, folks!  Time for another new episode!  Let's go!
Finally
I’ve seen my home on an oversimplified map, my life is complete!
Best video so far XD lmao at the finale,pls do more,hugs from Portugal
37:16  The Bishop from the video on The War of the Bucket: Ooooookay, I think you’re done.
The pig is so cute
Bruh how could you do our boys like that im happy we burned down the White House
This might be the best Christmas present I have gotten to far hehe
Too many jokes dial it down a bit
Congrats on number 1 on trending
7:57 Nice Smash Mouth reference.
31:03 damn his voice acting is so. Good i thought he wad someone else
do war of 1812
Love the vid, no matter the ire you cannot deny the simple and objective fact of American superiority.  <3 Oh and don't mention the Trent affair. Brits cannot stand when you mention they supported the racist south.
Hey Oversimplified,  I already know that you won’t read this but could you maybe make a video about the franco prussian war? Anyway, your video was perfect again!
Ok, the pig reminds me of Waddles in Gravity falls.
Don't give Americans any more ideas. The already tried to overthrow our own government this year
Trend in Spain new record
Must…resist…urge….to watch….entire channel…AGAIN  Me 2 hrs later: By golly hes done it again
I remember how boring the episodes of cartoons that involved history were... if only they were like oversimplified videos
FINALLYY
13:30 the irony is delicious.
I don't know if the canadians should be enraged or scared after oversimplied's speech at that ending
"Over whether the US Canada border looked like this.. or like this."  Farewell cruel world. My obituary shall say that I died how I lived. Laughing at weird cartoons.
Man, Oversimplified definitely went all out with this one, didn't he?  And it was all because of a pig...
1:25 Now THAT...is the shot heard 'round the world.
Are you R or D?
The ending absolutely sent me
Summary: america stole all of Britain's land
Requests: Philippine revolution and Philippine American war please
You can tell he at least spent 30 mins on the thumbnail
OverSimplified kinda lost his mind in the end
haha funny
cant wait for the american-canadian 2022 war video
YES MY MAN
Are you crazy
this channel just gets better and better
yo he just went insane at the end lmao
Could you do the antebellum period/ slavery in south United states
everyone is so hyped every time a new oversimplified video releases like 23 hours ago already 1mill holy!
BABE WAKE UP! New war just dropped!!! \o/
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
CHARLES GRIFFIN COME GET YOUR PIG
Colonisation and Imperialism are as natural an occurrence as one lion tacking over another's pride.
BEST VIDEO IVE SEEN IN A WHILE!!!!!
Porky is probably the cutest drawn animal I've seen. Almost cried, when he died...
Me: About to watch this on my phone. Me after seeing the time: BRO THIS A MOVIE.
10:25 I would love my country's Pairlament was like that, literally good comedy and a party everyday.
This is exactly where I am in my history class haha
Wait? Is I could have been Canadian?😳
Yay
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss upload
My man is back!
22 hrs
As a Canadian I would like to politely ask you to not invade us :)
Yay!!!!
12:15 hey look, its waddles
this channel lessons are getting wilder and wilder...
Time to wait another 6-8 months!
Do the hispanoamerican war plz
I love how the troops started getting along when they had the chance to and when they were not being ordered to fight each other by their brain dead commanding officers.
So, based on that ending... should I be rounding up my friends here down south to head to the border right about now? I mean, didn't we American's get over the "invade Canada" idea over 100 years ago? I swear we did... didn't we? Or maybe we didn't? o_O   Also... how could that man shoot the poor Morgan Freeman pig offering him wishes! The British should have arrested him for that for sure!
4:14 believe it or not this is actually how it happened
Jesus Christ is coming back soon! please take it serious what he spoken of is coming to pass right before our eyes.. it’s not a joke,so  y’all need to know the saving salvation of ur soul..that is in Jesus Christ who bore our sins He’s the way the truth and the life He brutality died on the cross to pay the penalty for all of our sins so that if you acknowledge you’re a sinner that’s sinned against His law and you turn to Him by confessing with your mouth that Jesus Lord and believe that he was raised from the dead and call upon his name and repent of ur sins you would be forgiven and saved spared from damnation and Heaven bound God bless you❤️
Honey get up oversimplified uploaded
YOOOOOO
The ending is the Best closure to a oversimplified video, there's isnt Even a contest
Less than 5 minutes in and I'm already laughing hard. The B2s are a good touch to that scene
I went on a Pacific Northwest vacation last summer and one of the places that I visited was San Juan island. The residents are fiercely proud of their island’s unique past, its historic role in the lime industry, and, of course, the Pig War. If you ever happen to be in Washington state, I highly recommend going there. It’s a truly unique place and is great if you want to be around nature.
Finally
Where’s nam? War
Jesus christ, a US takeover of Canada is honestly the most terrifying thing I can think of right now, I don't want it.   And I'm American.
That end part in the most enthusiastic thing I've ever seen
Unpopular opinion. Love your videos. Super informational about stuff I wanna know about. Cut out half of the comedy. It distracts from what I’m actually learning. K everyone can hate me now
Next three wars I want to see  Mexican-American War  Spanish-American War  Vietnam war
Pretty crazy that a pig almost caused Britain to get their ass kicked again..
That ending speech is the greatest anime speach of all time
He’s a fantastic voice actor lol
Omg Xmas came early
4:10
Explains why the Brit’s didn’t want to give up the Falklands
My gram lives on egg lake road on san juan island, Chris pratt lives there too lol
Nooooooo they might invade Canada eh :( We’ll be a little unhappy if you do
Nothing has made me prouder to be American than this video
38 minutes? OverSimplified ? More like comprehensive.
just a pig???? *vegans go crazy" :D
I didn't know they had ak47s in the 1800s
YESSIR NEW VIDEO!!
After all these years (months), it finaly came
Ive been watching for years and its great to see him growing so much!!!
Can u plz do the opium wars plz

The tactical airstrikes of the buffalo were critical in the expansion west
Natives: *killing and conquering each other for imperialistic tendencies*  US: Well, the natives were doing it to each other for such a long time, why not we join in on the fun?
Can u plz do Vietnam war?
Christmas isn’t for another 18 days sir
This man is the most messed-up crazy and funniest individual the planet earth has ever seen. Honestly man, just keep it up.
Graduations on trending
#1 on trending
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED!!!!!
As an American, I support the proposal at the end of the video
why ya bullying Canada
Bliss.
Sponsorship with Nord VPN  Most creators: Honest scripted segments  Oversimplified: Always show Oversimplified Hitler
This is The most American ending I’ve ever seen
Someone has to take Britain's ruler, they have a problem with straight lines
As always, thoroughly entertaining, well written and a terrific piece of history I never knew before now ♥️ from another soon to be former empire colony, SCOTLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This was so entertaining, keep up the good work!
37:25 BOOOO!
'The War of The Mother'
Me: I thought you were dead Oversimplified: My death… was greatly exaggerated
“You two are the most mind-numbingly brain dead ding-dongs I’ve ever encountered…”. This is oversimplified’s equivalent of the f-word.
OK please speak about Thailand next video
37:18 Oh God. oh god
30 minutes of limbo
The oversimplified plushie is the best thing to come out this year
I don't know how, but this was the hardest I have ever laughed from your videos. I thought the "Yeah, you" joke on Napoleon destroyed me, but this one, all of the jokes stuck and made me laugh.  Also, can we get some Fs in chat for Waddles?
He’s back
I wish oversimplified could be my history teacher
4:14 Manifest Destiny, folks! 22:27 This guy has gone mad! Over 1 pig! 31:10 I have to ask where did you get that Patrick Steward sound clip from?
Amazing vid
after justifiably shooting that british guy's pig I would have brought the pig to him and said "well it was up to you to keep MY bullets out of YOUR pig"
I like how the thumbnail is based off star wars
I like how the thumbnail is based off star wars
It'll be funny if biden saw this and was like mwah ha ha ha ha
It felt like he put too much stupid comedy in the vid more than usual
Oops oversimplified I went to far. I started invadeing greenland
Return of the king
OverSimplified can do many things, but one thing I didn't know he could do was make me break into a cold sweat once he said "Could America perhaps... still, invade Canada?"
OverSimplified: Calls for America to invade Canada American supporters taking up the call to arms and charging into Canada: Hoot Hoot Hoot Hoot Hoot
I’m a kid and your videos make it funny and educational and I just love them😍
can you please do "weak confederation " pleaaaase <3
I am back to see his rant
And the time is finally there! A new video of the amazing Oversimplified!
Nice
The pig’s voice acting was astounding, I do say laudable even.  10/10 video
thank you
Great vid as always
P
A war for a piece of bacon
Pls do the Crusades
OverSimplified: *waiting to upload these videos to allow for new potential NordVPN users*
Within 24 hours let’s go
Lesgo
I’m an American and I feel attacked.  Does that count as a civil war???
Your back yay
I spoiled myself by looking at the actual map and saw who got the islands.       USA, baby.
The return of the king
Hatfields and Mccoys would be a pretty cool idea
Soo cool
As always your videos are spot on , and always make me laugh.  That being said Biden cant wipe his own butt much less take over another country.
How exactly, did the moron that is William S. Harney become a General, when everyone around him considered him an idiot? And on that line of thinking how did Pickett get promoted from Captain to General when he was one of the central figures in the brain-dead shit show that was the dispute of San Juan island? Shouldn't that have been held as a mark against him? I thought General was meant to be one of the highest ranks in the military that needed many years of great service to attain. Or did they just promote higher ranks by having a best moustache contest back in those days? -_-'
What’s up with Biden😂
When Oversimplified doesn't upload for 7 months, you know something good's coming
Where is oversimplified vietnam war?
Griffin’s pig: dies  Me: dude , uncool
This video is the best oversimplified video so far I love it
Yea, we’re comin’ for ya Canada! 🇨🇦🔜🇺🇸

Can we have a character pin of the yeee haw guy
Wait... when I see this video i realize that the picture of the pig was actually my current profile picture!    LONG LIVE PIGS!
Any other Washingtonians here who've never heard this story?
This one was desperate to be funny peppered with liberal propaganda
Let’s go!
Oversimplified 2024
Two million views in one day? Damn.
I'm watching this in Victoria and I can see the San Juan Islands from my house, this is tripping me out 🤣🤣🤣
How you have this much views that quickly
The facial expressions of the characters just get better and better!
the legend has returned :0
See ya next year
HE UPLOADED NO FUCKING WAY
YAYYYY U FINALLY UPLOADED

Next video: What if Drake won the  presidential election
Your better that my teacher of history.
Dude what the heck are they doin over there?  Greets from Germany, you making good videos pal
Bro was that Morgan Freeman?
I know it was a joke, but as a Canadian I genuinely was scared of that last part
16:28 That face is killed me lol
How’d u get Morgan freeman for this
This channel used to be fun, but seems to have traded "oversimplifed" for "find any and all ways to bash America and dedicate something like half of the first four minutes to doing so." Pass.
I can listen to that skit at 7:58 for an entire month
Well, that speech has me convinced, surrender now you overnice swines
Technoblade lore
Drake is Canadian 🤣
Can You do more history like the do the Vietnam war or Korea War
6:53 for those who want to skip the sponsorship segment
who saw the all star reference
Mam Oversimplified Educating me on things i never knew and Entertaining me at the same time? Every teacher in the World wants to know you're secret.
Greetings from Whidby Island; just south of the Orcas Islands.  Your videos are hilarious 😂
My man over simplified just started ww3 at the end
What a treat, I get an Oversimplified video on my Birthday!
Uploaded!!! EPIC
Is it just me or did OverSimplified get political?
This is one of your best videos ever
dreaming for a video about brazil
What the he'll?
NerdVPN
do an ancient civilazations series or episode
“DRAKE!!”
This whole thing is like an episode of red vs blue
Best thumbnail I've ever seen
See ya in 🤔..  ⌚ about six months..
The last part was very funny
Wait this is why there is so many Americans flag in USA I understand why
Mmmm pigs
Who was here for da permiere!
Great video, again
Pickett looks way too much like Ian McCollum, I can’t unsee it
H  O  L Y  S H I T  Are you telling me the Pig War in Hey Arnold is based on a real thing?!
As long as we don’t have to deal with your political party bullshit, still have free healthcare And Have the same gun laws that we have here in Canada I don’t think anyone will notice
Fun fact: bacon rebellion, and arguably the beginning of America's horrendous race relations, started over a pig dispute.  There's just something very American about starting small wars over pigs.
The last minute of this video is a fever dream and I love it
This channel is so good i want to cry
Oversimplified is sooooooo underrated
Excuse me, Whatcom?
We have done the emu war and the pig war I’m just waiting for the goat war
Biden sound so weird now that ive heard byron
34.00 Winfield Scott xD my Mann
Kkkk
"Biden coming baby"  -Oversimplified
Amazing video
Of course Germany gave the islands to the us, Germany hated the british
You should do the british empire oversimplified
Honestly though, it would probably take American votes to get Drake elected…
Hey oversimplified you should do a war on the Mexican cristero war. I feel that it will be quite interesting. 🇲🇽
Oversimplified is back yet again. We got the football war now the pig war, what next? The couch war?
I find the end of this video funny because I live near the US-Canadian border
Oversimplified most legendary ending oversimplified
19:35 Well deserved. Leave Pigs Alone!
Thomas: the west is ours  British: Dream on
I’ve seen this Nicholas Cage movie.
That thumbnail is pure effort
Best one yet, couldn’t stop laughing at some parts. Great work!
History teacher is back
next can you do a video about the war of the roses
Best history
What about point roberts?
Everyone: Expecting Vientnam War  Oversimplified: Did someone say pigs?
HES BACK
To be honest, the voice of the pig sounded kinda like Vitruvius from the lego movie.
Yesirrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!
I like the wordplay at 3:38 for "Density" for "Destiny," as it's acquiring more land
Has no one has noticed that this video is highly detailed and NOT OVERSIMPLIFIED.    I feel cheated and demand a refund.
Jesus Christ, that end speech went 0-100 real quick
i'm very new to this channel. I started watching this morning and this is the third I've seen. I'm absolutely loving it.   The common theme is that they all involve someone being hoisted.
New video wooooooo
That ending took a twist
32:28
Middle channel obviously
Splendid one, Mr. OverSimplified.
Absolutely excellent video in every single way.   Side note this video was curiously nuanced and and thorough to be "Overly Simplified".
True
I'm with Charles Griffin. If I could start a war over someone shooting my cat, I probably would
HES BACK BABY!!!!
Love your content but you should do Julius Caesar or the Punic wars
3:43 They couldn't have known about the disease though
these videos have improved so much
Nice! A new upload after months!
I’m I just imagine the all star reference
This is the second year where Christmas came early because he posted something!
PLEASE UPLOAD AGAIN
The legend is back baby
26:30 Battles drawing crowds of civilian spectators was not unheard of, especially in cases when tensions had long been brewing and word had had a chance to spread. This all changed very suddenly one day in the early civil war when at the First Battle of Bull Run, a merry company of picnicers having hunkered down on a hill overlooking the battlefield suddenly got heavily shelled by mistake. From that point on civilians was discouraged to spectate military clashes - for their own sake, and not without some grumbling from commanding officers on both sides over losing what they thought of encouraging cheering, good for morale and displays of heroism among the soldiers.  Awesome channel, by the way. I've seen it mentioned in comment sections of many a Kurtzgesagt video and now it showed up in my recommended, I thought to give it a try. I'm not disappointed, really like the goofy style combined with the thorough research. Good stuff!
See this is the type of American Pzazz that gets you land in international arbitrations with the empire of Germany.
Why does Spuddy have Sonic shoes?
hi
I lost it when he said “Biden’s coming Baby” 😂😂😂😂
"I hear voices all the time"
Fun fact that Oversimplified didn't bring up: you see that little blue bit east of Vancouver Island at 9:22? That's Point Roberts, Washington, which has a population of about 1,300 and was ignored by that treaty, so though it would have been easier for everyone involved for that to be Canada, it's part of America, and kids in fourth grade and beyond have to cross an international border twice, with a 40-minute drive through BC, to go to school in Blaine, WA.
Nord VPN is not at Brazil? YOU ARE GOING TO BRAZIL
Those Canadians do look like they need some freedom 👀🇺🇸
Well that took a turn at the end there....
THAT ENDING THO
LES GOOOO NEW VIDEOOOOO
gotta say, the "keep your potatoes out of my pig" thing was a pretty great comeback. Also, what kind of dick just fences off three sides of their garden and then gets mad at a pig for being a pig?
Can you do a video on the 7 years war or the 30 years war? Greatings from Germany 🇩🇪🇩🇪
You should create a Nord VPN character pin.
I will gladly support the US conquest of Canada.
Heya, new to the channel, loving the content! Quick question: why is Oversimplified's Hitler video(s) blocked in the UK?
lol oversimplified us americans go to war with canada no way not on my watch
we need more Canada
What
WHAT THE HELL THIS IS #1 TRENDING
6:09 that dude looks like Markiplier
In fallout lore, the USA does annex Canada
The ending killed me
33:09 The High pitched scream KILLED me lol
YES! A new Oversimplified video! They are AMAZING ⭐️. Definitely continue making more!
think who has more friends Canada or USA. Who has already burned down the other's parliament. Who would endlessly shoot hockey pucks at the other. who would get beavers to chop down trees on them. Who will release the elk upon the other.   listen to this song on youtube   War of 1812 - Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie
How different could things have been??  Holy hell... I'm still laughing.  Think about it.....
As a Canadian, I was kinda supporting that Americans invade Canada at the end there
Actually, that destiny was given by Funny Valentine.
he is back. the man, the mith, the legend.
OMG OVERSIMPLIFIED THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
The ending lmaoooooo
That was the best end to video ever
7:15 he has his what now
Before watching this video I was a Pacifist and now I am in the act of invading Canada.
I noticed that he's* actually screaming lines now instead of trying to shout quietly whenever a character yells, and it makes it so much funnier  *Edit: damn I changed it to he, yall gotta relax
7:58 Smash Mouth All Star
Absolutely brilliant and funny as always well done man. I love all your videos, they are well worth the wait so keep em coming!
FINALLY! Been needing some oversimplified
This video was amazing
It's official the USA is at war with Canada 😂
Are never not technically at war with Canada? ""They"" gave us Nickelback and won't take them back. That's more than enough reason to initiate war.
This is officially one of my favorite videos of yours
I am glad he’s back
Yugoslav war!!
As usual, love the video... but seriously dude, 6 months ?????
when new video
19:32 bro started tackling because of his pig
9:16 :):):):):)
On my deepest dreams I see a future on which Oversimplified makes a video about the War of the Pacific
The thumbnail is the reason we're here
Not even 24 hrs and the dude is #1 trending, true legend 👏👏
Man am i glad hes back
You should do the boer war
Hi
4 Oversimplified ideas that we need: 1) Russian Civil War Oversimplified 2) Vietnam War Oversimplified 3)Indian Independence Oversimplified 4) American Mexican War Oversimpified
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
What an end !! Thank you from the other side of the Atlantic
Your animations keep getting better and better. If I compare your first videos to this one, there is a big difference in the animations. Keep up the great work!
"Whoa whoa whoa. I didn't say they were white people" best line yet and I'm only like 2 minutes in 🤣🤣🤣
New video after months yay!!!
As a European slav, all i can say about the final. Ehm, suggestion is “da bliea* are dey dewing ova dea?   Am sure that Moscow will find this eem, INTERESTING.
but did morgan freeman just voice the pig
As a Canadian. I approve of a American invasion
FINALLU
I know the end is a joke...but for reals, though...
Why you gotta my country that way dude uncool
“Indepedence, baby”
me, watching this while going to college in Seattle: *happy northwest noises*
5:16 Politicians be like
Is it just me, or are the newer videos getting better and better?
7:59 bars
Can you make one of war of the roses
If I was Griffin, I would also beat the shit out of Lyman
I feel like there was a bit much comedy in this one
That end was the most emotional oversimplified has gotten which is saying something
This your best video
Yess Finale another video
This videos have gotten so fucking funny I’ve been watching for a hot second and this shit is amazing
3:55 “I hear voices all the time”
Let's burn the Whitehouse down again
Was it just me but I was worried that oversimplified had stop posting episodes, I am glad that I was wrong.
Oversimplified: The Toledo War
Firstly, Biden has to deal with China and Russia, only then he can invade Canada.
the end was a bit over the top...
That ending though
Hey can you do the Mexican American War
Imagine being Charles Griffin trying to make a humble living with your sheep farm and live a peaceful life, only for some dude to shoot your prized pig, get your sheep stolen, get threatened with guns and nearly start a war. Like BRUHHH.
Not only the pig died, but also the potatoes!
Yessss another video!
I would like to see him tackle the Hatfield-McCoy Feud.
Why didnt the british take the Islands as soon as they heard of the settlers.
You should do one on the spainish American  war
I wish I had you when I was in 7th grade Washington history class.
Oh my! This is his best video so far. My happines is immeasurable, and my day is enriched.
All across the country, middle school history teachers will be furiously clicking away at their laptops and pulling plugs on their projectors to end this video at 36:56
Babe, wake up! Oversimplified just posted a new video
Let’s gooooooooo new video thank you I’m getting great grades on history because of you thanks I’m such a fan!
You can really see their animation improving! I loved the smooth animations and jokes in this one!
HE UPLOADED FINALLY
The ending 😂😂 “Biden’s coming baby!” Hahahahaha
Good video
Oversimplified war of 1812 when?
33:23
The last part, scared me
Dude I love your videos so much
This is so funny
37:59 this sounded personal
am I a soup?
This Week in Politics: End Segment of YouTube Video Sparks International Hostilities Between Canada and the United States of America
I think he should make another better ww1 video and a better ww2 video so I can see all the jokes he’s going to put in them
Pretty cool and unexpected, given I live in whatcom county, and can literally drive 2 miles and look at the islands in question in this video.
The artwork, the script, the jokes... Oversimplified, this is the best Christmas present ever👍👍😘😘!!
The guy who places a McDonald’s made me laugh so hard😂😂
Just a video idea Scottish Wars of Independence
37:39 man chill even for me this is too much
awesome
Love to see these vids in my subs
Don't have anything in particular to say (I always enjoy these) but they post so rarely that I need to make sure to comment and boost that anyway. =)
UR BACK :)
The ending scared my Canadian ass
New vid
*New Oversimplified video* Excellent! *Immediately gets Prager U ads on everything* …Ah.
29:09 my favorite moment
33:30 it was like this is happened
When I got a notification saying oversimplified and pig I was thinking the bay of pigs incident but instead I got this masterpiece
32:31
This channel is why youtube exists and the world is better for it
More sweden
That was beautiful
There isn't a big enough thumbs up button
ⓉⒽⒾⓈ ⓌⒶⓈ ⓉⒽⒺ ⓁⒶⓈⓉ ⓉⓄⓅⒾⒸ Ⓘ ⒺⓍⓅⒺⒸⓉⒺⒹ
By the time he releases a new video I would have graduated high-school 🥲
you just know its a good day when oversimplified posts
This guy never shut up about nord vpn
Me thinking the end was gonna be some lame sponsor only for it to turn into the most wonderfully cursed patriotic speeches of all time
Serbs:     I've already seen this one
16:00 Only a true American can fire an AK in the 1800s
Nice one in the end
holy mackeral ive been waiting months finaly
I dis the calculation in my head based on all your uploads and knew it would be yesterday
The little speech at the end... I'm from Spain and I'm like: (cricket sounds)
That ending 😂😂😂
How about we keep Canada and even though in American I don’t want Canada who wants to start a war over Canada so how bout we don’t do that
I like the attention to detail… specially the colouring of Point Robert’s as American.
I miss you
lmao
im so glad your back!!! you make me ACE my studies and i actually enjoy it!
You really should do a vid on the spanish civil war, youve covered a lot of 20th century stuff already but not that
"Now, what kind of idiot would almost start a war by being militarily aggressive on a small piece of territory?" *realizes it's the same man who did Pickett's charge* "Yeah, sounds about right."
33:27 I died. Absolutely died
legendary video
Once again, another amazing video from Oversimplified. Very Funny and Informative. And amazing and funny ending,
THE ENDING IS SO FUNNY
Don’t give us any ideas
JUST WOW! I love your videos, but this one is another level up, Perfect :)
Love a good history class, makes me smarter! 😻💔 tickle tickle
I love your channel keep up the great stuff!
when we said that u should say canada more we meant that say nice things
I've been waiting on an new episode for a while.  The :)
WAKE UP BABE, NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEOS JUST GOT DROPPED
You should do these topics: Black Death The 100 years war The great northern war And etc
BRUHH this is the funniest yet!! SHERIFF BARNES THOUGH HAHA
Finally somebody actually reacted to the add
Yo simplified, what are you planning with Canada?
Hoes mad (x24) (american expansionism version)
I support the end message…:)
😂greatest video ever!
Welp... he finally lost it folks, now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna let Norm the genie know that we're taking Canada!
pickett and harney reminds me of jack d ripper and lionel mandrake of dr strangelove
Wish I could like twice...
37:10 YESSSS, THE CANADIANS CAN'T STOP US!!FINISH WHAT WE STARTED ALL THOSE YEARS AGO!!! 🇺🇲🇺🇲🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸
now we wait another year for Vietnam (really good video tho)
I kinda miss the old oversimplified where jokes were witty and dry instead of screaming
Yes
Oversimplified: WE CAN TAKE OVER CANADA!!!!!! IT'S OUR MANIFEST DESTINY!!!!!  Mexico: I'm just gonna....go somewhere safe......
Can you make a video about the spanish civel war
Okay so I know they bring this up in every single one of their NordVPN sponsorships, but where exactly is the Hitler video blocked? I'm from Germany and all that jazz back then is a touchy subject, but even I can watch the video with no issue.
I like how between the 2 American flags at the beginning the banners form a Russian flag
When you started talking about NordVPN during the 5:26 bit I was completely in awe with my mouth wide open... you played me like a fiddle, you completely had me, I did not expect it.
The end is video was BRILLIANT.
Can you please do Germany and the creating of the Kaiserreich in 1871?
Christmas is early
Very interesting
please come we welcome our future occupiers with open arms
LET'S GO
Damn I want a pig now.
Oversimplified WW3 coming soon?
HE HAS RETURNED
He's BACK
Yheeees a new oversimplified video
YES A NEW VIDEO OH MY GOD YES YES YES
You should do the convicts arriving in Australia stuff like captain cook lying to the British and the fact that half of them where criminals would make for a pretty funny video
Oversimplified turned into a different man with that ending speech about invading Canada
I think OverSimplified lost his mind.
Bruh 3 on trending
Oversimplified starting wars to create more content is probably the biggest brain move I’ve seen in the last decade.
Troll 2 and Dirty Harry 😁
So when will you do Vietnam war or the Crimean war
this is amazing
My god boys Christmas has come early, again
I like to think the pig doesnt just look like waddles, but also the first time it talked is a reference to when Neil deGrasse Tyson gave his voice to waddles in the show and this pig also gets an epic voice.
Really makes you think about the way America is. They fought over the shooting of a single pig.....
We never asked for it, but we sure needed it
The pig is super unsettling. It’s the only character with a full walk cycle in the history of Oversimplified.
We should Invade Canada,  I've been saying that since I moved to the USA
finally he's back
12:24 KSP VAB MUSIC
I get the feeling that Oversimplified has something against Canada
37:16 That “Think about it...” is said exactly how characters who becomes the main antagonist start their twist villain speech.
If a gun doesn't solve the problem then use more guns  -  Wise Americans
i thought this video was about uckranie
That ending. Just imagine you are his neighbour. You know that he does historical videos. And suddenly, all you hear is a 60 seconds monolog about the US taking over Canada.   This appeased the Audience, which loved it severely
"I hear voices all the time"
I feel like people who aren't even from Canada will most likely be more offended from that ending than actual native Canadian people
Make yugoslav wars already pls
“Brit cizten” YAYY WE BURN THW WHITE HOUSE HAHA “usa” NOOOOOOO YOU MONSTER IM GONNA GIVE REVENGE
It's always nord VPN
The voice is instantly recognizable
The thumbnail gives me Star Wars Angry Birds vibes more than just Star Wars
33:29 Is my absolute favorite part of this entire video
7:32 For meme reasons, should of put oh no.
I am incredibly happy and my day has been made
It took me till the second time watching it to realize that the phones they were using were bananas and irons cuz phones didn’t exist yet XD
Never disappoints !
Last time I checked we burned down the White House. And gosh darn we’d do it again
In that case, you talk about Hungary even less than Canada.
Bruh im sraced as à canadienne
Biden coming eh? Bill clinton taught him well
1:25 roasted bro
All in favour of OverSimplified doing a video about the Crusades next?
Cool
i swear to god your videos only get better
Waiting 6 months for a video like this disappointed me
You should make a video about Alexander Hamilton and his life story
Amazing videos!! I would really love to see a Greek War of Independence 1821, I also would like to see how would you make a video about that 🇬🇷💥🇹🇷
I called the nord vpn ad the second he said you should use
28:10 But i like to think they did.... UWU
#1 on trending yet again!
Congrats on #1 On Trending! Only MrBeast and legends have done thaf
This might actually be your greatest video yet. Certainly the funniest imo
I wanna see what your face looks like… your voice is so perfect for these videos I just need to know what you look like
Yesssssss a another oversimlified video
You make History way more fun to learn, thank you for making these! I love to hear the notifications that you posted, I’m so happy I found this channel!
Hey Arnold did a pig war episode too, anyone remember that??
I'm convinced. Let's invade Canda.
I like how it’s fair offers and the Americans refuse to agree to it.
1st on trending in The UK! Well done Oversimplified!
Yes! Another upload!
OverSimplified finally uploaded
30:27
He's backk
Isn't it so wholesome that the Americans came up with an excuse for their imperialist ambitions instead of just doing it and saying fuck everyone. They're so nice.
37:39 if I were ever to see that here I would commit suicide
Scott should have won the election of 1852.
Isn’t it first taken, first served? I swear that qoute came from 1400~  I guess Americans hasn’t changed since history’s start.
Crying with laughter at the end. I'm not even American but I was just overcome with an urge to inva.... Never mind
Oversimplified wants to start a world war just so he can have an excuse to release a World War 3 video
That's how war goes, it comes from nothing. Thank God it stayed nothing, huh?
♡♡
Is it me or are they using the Panama Canal before it was actually built?
I mean , if you need help: We Germans know how to make surprise invades on our neighbours .... you just need to finish it in a better why i guess ;)
One of the most stupidest ‘Wars’ in history.
this enraged the UN who punished him severely
Yay
R.I.P Griffin’s pig 😔 Press O to pay respect.
7:56 I see that they smash-mouthed their way through.
well it started USA WILL TAKE OVER CANADAAAAAA MURIICAAAAAAAAAAAAA
21h 2.2m 254k 23k. Yay. Hello there dudas.     Random thought:  Everybody: BuT WhErE'S ViEtNaM   As you can see I  mean read I mean see the letters, I have nowhere I'm going with this to and I also wanna sleep. Atleast now I have 40 minutes coupon of procrastinating but feeling smart. (Just incase, cuz like, im not like a gonna be anywbere near  history stuff job person)
Despite our history, shout out to our brothers and sisters in the North whose grand-fathers/great-grandfathers stormed the beaches of Normandy alongside ours.  Canada, you're awesome! -An American
HAAAAAALELUJAAAAAAAAH! OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED A CHRISTMAS PRESENT!
wtf the ending                     gg
Dat ending tho....      Lmfao
we will burn the white house again try us
I hope that he does one on Vietnam soon.
god save the queen
The sad thing is, the American invasion via trade is probably succeeding. I swear Toronto and south Ontario just feel like an extension of the States.  On the flipside, Harney sounds like one of the guys who's going straight to military hell.  Oh and good news: Hornby was eventually promoted to full Admiral for later services. Based on his conduct here, I'd say he deserved it.
OMG HE POSTED
HES BACKKK see you in June
“I didn’t say they were white ppl” 😂 couldn’t get anymore simpler than that. Glad you’re back I miss this glorious content
Did this man just shit-post on Canada?
4:10 7:28 16:30 American party time 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
These videos get better n better
Return of the King
Pig be like I am inevitable  almost starting a war
This man wants America to go to war with Canada just so he can make a video on it. Gotta respect the dedication.
Can I just say the house of lords is red not green
And that's how the 2021 war between the US and Canada started over a YouTube video
Your speach at the end sounded so intimidating. Your voice changed completly, beautiflu. Just, leave quebec alone, these catholics would fuck you protestants over. (Also im half french but what ever. Im not even anglo, im a damn slav)
wht the hell was tht at the end of it...lmao
Holy fucking shit balls he's back our lord and savior!!!!!
I think that skit with the walkin pig doing the old mobster routine is the funniest thing ive ever seen.
Guy 1:Well you should NordVPN Guy 2: what the fu-
I, for one, accept our new American overlords
I love that the islands I call home are view for the world. Thanks OverSimplified!
USA!! WE'RE COMING CANADA
I'm waiting for OverSimplified to simplify the Coronavirus. That'd be fun!
The amount of happiness I get when I see a new Oversimplified video on my home page is astronomical
I LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU!!
You and Erwin Smith have the best speeches🎉🎉
Finally a Canadian episode (I'm Canadian)!!! Also I no wanna war man
See you in 6 months I guess
you made me want to invade Canana at the end 😭
Yep, i remember learning about this a long time ago
Nah the UK won the war of 1812
Wait did he actually get Morgan Freeman for this
I'm German and fest more patriotism for the USA than fir Germany at the end. Is that good?
It's America's Manifest Destiny, to build McDonald's across the world!
The end killed me !!! Hahahaha xD
At the end man sounds like a bayblade character.
He is back
COOOOONTEEEEENT
Honestly, I could see this decade having an American war with Canada. Seems like the trendy thing to do.
they had to fight over a bunch of small island thats what i call dumb
War of 1812 ended in a...draw? I believe you meant CLEAR AMERICAN VICTORY!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
War of the bucket: I'm the dumbest war ever fought over fort and bucket🪣 War of the Pig: hold my pretty flowers 💐🐷
And when the world needed him most, he returned :)
So America was a country started by stupid gun toting idiots, and now people are confused but the gun toting trumpists who exists there?
Pleeeeeeaaaase make a video about Americans taking Mexico's territory
Only og's remember when he was 5k subs
PLEAAAASSEEE can you do the Vietnam war
Thumbnail obviously inspired by Star Wars: Angry Birds. I'm not even joking.
Gotta release more videos.. people love your videos
Fun Fact: There’s Wild Gazelles that live up in the San Juan Islands. Yep, AFRICAN Gazelles.  Why? Because the islands used to be a hotspot for Rich American “Gentlemen” and they transported African wildlife to the islands to use them for sport hunting. For now, they populate one of the northern islands and it is illegal to set foot on that particular island. You can see the herds by boats or from neighboring islands. The island is called Spieden Island.
On trending already, let's goo
oversimplifed should anex canada
7:58 Ok that was brilliant.
I have been awaiting your return m’lord
This is number fucking one on trending. God damn
Hearing Oversimplified go on a massive patriotic and passionately FURIOUS rant about the US invading Canada of all places has to be the best thing to happen to me in 2021.  Edit: Is it weird I found the pig actually having a proper walk cycle really disturbing since most Oversimplified characters moreso “wiggle”???
YES!! new Oversimplified video!!! Christmas sure came early!!
America wouldn’t stand a chance. Canada never lost a war
the president who finally integrates the northern states into the union will be one of the greats
Damn this video was great
Captain hornby and general harny l:
It does take a long time to research and animate tho good job!
Hell yeah bruther, we oughtta go show them moose ridin, maple syrup drinkin, eh sayin canadians who's boss yeehaw!
was I the only one that saw a face at 4:49?
One of your best videos yet, OverSimplified!
Please  make more videos OverSimplifed
I funking love you and your editing and now this storyyyy is hilariousssss
Well that got weird.
watching the live chat for the ending was a treat!
The end is beautiful
I saw the live stream
Finally a new video thx!!
Or we could just leave Canada alone, they already have idiots leading them. We don't need our idiots to be in charge of them.
Ur the best so I got so happy I heard you released a new video
what do you want to tell joe byren rn?
Honestly, with how absolutely absent minded and stupid the current president is, I wouldn't doubt him trying to invade Canada
whwear cafa
I like the thumbnail it pretty creative lol
Will there be a video about the war of 1812?
I like your videos. I just don't like how you seem to always make the US look like the worst While leaving out bad things that other did. For example, one of the reasons the US went to war with England in the war of 1812 was because the British seized US shipping and pressed US sailors into British crews.
Biden’s coming baby, and he’s going to drool all over you
I have a feeling that every other country in the world this is actually how they see us "being an American he pulled 4 pistols on him" LMAO it cracks me up
FINALLY, HE IS BACK
4:04. America. F yeah lol
to quote a previous oversimplified: "See, America? You've always been this way..."
Finally
Americans are salty because as long as canada is a place the US cant reach it's full potential
Me seeing the tile: OMG! @OverSimplifed made a video about @Technoblade. Let’s gooo!
Now I know why Canada was never conquered. Until the end of this video… we never had the motivation…
Harney is like the dumb person that doesn’t do any s do work in a group project
Yo nice video my school may have used one of your videos
I’m laughing so hard at this video 🤣 I love all of them! Please do The French and Indian war!
2.2 million views in 20 hour, just brilliant! I love Oversimplified!
8:00 my god this cit. is magnificent
The ending is so great
Now we need the American-Mexican War
As a Canadian, I am fully for the invasion of Canada as long as we just surrender so we don't lose a bunch of lives because Canada would be way better as American.
Pls upload more I am tired of watching all of your videos 5 times each
When you realize OverSimplified is back: *Happy noises* When you realize this means you have to wait 6 months for another upload: *Sad noises*
I’ve just binged your entire series, ending with this. I am both incredibly happy and incredibly sad that I have no more videos to watch by you.
I SHOULD GO TO SLEEP BUT.....
Embarrassed at how excited I got to see this notification
The Morgan Freeman pig 😭😭😭😭
yay a new vid i love your videos OverSimpilfied
It's insane how far he's come from his First video
He's back!
As a person who has lived on Vancouver Island most of my life it is great to see some History of my area being presented in such a big and great way!
LETS GOOO NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VID!
Could you do mongol empire please
Plss make a the 4 of the india Pakistan war
pig war... i should have known...
The obsession with straight lines and the use of poor maps are why America has two exclaves of territory in Canada at the Northwest Angle, Minnesota, and in the tiny peninsular community of Point Roberts, Washington.
Ok but i really need more videos about Central America
Funny story
I've been waiting for this video forever! :D
Im all in baby to manifest destiny Canada !!!!! USA USA USA
Up next: The Oversimplified “Pig War” video War 2021-???? A YouTube video triggers an old American conflict resulting in a war that Oversimplified will oversimplify for one of his videos
Remember American a 100 Royal Marines destroyed 1000 American marines easily and that isn’t the only time us British showed up you yanks.   Rule Britannia, god save the queen 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I’m still waiting for Vietnam
Blokes unreal wish he uploaded more
Wow, this part of American history with potatoes is a Technoblade reference
It would of been funnier if Charles Griffin real name was Peter Griffin.
When a history channel is better than everything else on your feed
While watching, i got a scam call. And said this is a mc-donalds. Best way to never get scammed buy the same guy
No way he did a video so awesome
160 years later, the total population of that island is still only about 6500 people. I was unable to find statistics on the number of pigs, except that there's less than 200.  Potato farming is the island's largest agricultural industry.
Yes finally
Give us a full parody of all star
That guy got whooped! 33:29-33:35
Ayo speak on Mexico
Finally another video!
THIS IS SO FRICKING POG
I live in Israel. We have seen our fair share of weird history, but goddamn not nearly as much as the shit I heard on this account about the USA.
It’s such an event when these get posted, love them sooooo much.
18:27 What I've learned; You can dance with a potato.
6 months is a looong time....
Guess who almost had a war fought over them.
Hey! A history of my town goes viral for once 😁 ...wait
The best marksmen in the world are Canadian.
All in favour of oversimplified doing a video about the Crusades next?
Over simplified bragging for the 839379373 time in how their hitler video is banned in some countries
and Yes to takking their land
Also Due to Canadian Stereotypes it would be  a easy invasion cause they would just say Yes to us invadding them
If you are courageous do Yugoslav wars episode :D
FRANKREICH
*14:30* sǝᴉqooq
"Lyman if you spare my life, I will grant you 3 wishes"  *shoots anyway  My God I was not expecting that and it was hilarious
Friday harbor is super pretty, definitely recommend a visit
It's incredible how you can keep making these masterpieces, fantastic!
I suggest Oversimplified Should Make the greek revolution in oversimplified, +1 if you agree
Canada is so fucked😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Hey colonizer” 🤓🤓🤓
Reminds me of that hey Arnold episode
@OverSimplifield  Im still wating on a Yugoslav video
These videos are getting more funnier every time. 😂
lol but what about canada?
YES 30MINS+ YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I don't think Biden has came in awhile but, I mean, maybe.
Imagine if this acctually sparks a invasion of canada
"Oh now don't point that thing at me bud! I'll have you know I'll only come back stronger thanks to my free healthcare!" The last Canadian before the takeover-2042
Okay, we don’t want you talking about Canada anymore LMAO
3:33 florida is a bit sus
We expect stuff like napoleon and hitler, Instead you upload emu and pig.
Wait you are alive?
Oversimplified vids are basically the only long vids i ever watch without skipping
Storm ‘‘em boys
If America invaded Canada, overseas everyone would be like "dude, uncool"
There a channel that used to do the exact same thing as your channel but in Arabic, is it connected to yours or are they stealing your content?. You can just search up “oversimplified Arabic” and find it.
Taking over Canada eh? Sounds like we're drifting towards Fallout lore with annexing Canada XD
HES BACK!!!
'Merica! FUCK YEAH! Here to take all your land away YEAH!
The end tho
YASSS
the last part would make sense, except for the fact that: US gets many goods and trades from canada, and this will stop those Canada has a ton of connections with places like britain, france, and russia, which will not be good for the US Canadian cold fronts are terrible for american troops You can't make nuclear bombs without uranium, and guess where america gets those?
Hey, man. Love your videos, but I think you're getting a bit too heavy handed with the jokes and skits. Not saying to get rid of them, but maybe tone it down a bit. You know: shorten them a bit.
I love that ending because of how inaccurate it is
UK should have had San Juan!
These episode should’ve been a mini war.
This video is amazing
he actually got louder  and I LOVE IIIIIIIIT
33:25 Harney got punished severely
I love how every single one of Oversimplified’s videos always get #1 on trending. The only exception I can think of is Prohibition because MrBeast uploaded a video on the same day. It got #2.
nice vid
27:25 like this or like this *nothing changes* 😂😂😂💀💀
When OverSimplified uploads, it's always a good day
I love your vids they are so good I’m a history nerd I love wars and stuff like this
33:27 That felt soooo earnest and honest. Jeez. Btw, the walking animation of the mafia pig was epic.
OMG They post something 😳😳😳
You should do a New Zealand video 🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿
2m views in 21h
that ending xD
We need to sub to the one and only voice of the pig: Charlie Hopkinson
I recently went on a rant with my android. messenger gave my location away after a certain amount of time, completely ruining the writing.  (It didn't have the permissions to do so.)  Try it out yourself, but do know it has to be quite the long rant.
This video is a definition of a masterpiece !
He’s above the fortnite tubers on trending
20:04 Is that a face on the blue?
OMG i was about to PUSH my computer when i saw canada with us flag at the end !!! 😡🤮🤮🤣
i wonder how long an over-complexified version of this video would be
What an ending. These vids are always worth the wait
Oversimplified, please could you cover the Chinese civil war or maybe something to do with the last of the Byzantines in your next topic plsss
Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming
"This video is unavailable"
OMG oversimplified uploaded, christmass is early this year :)
Christmas definitely came early this year
Im sorry the what now?
I'd love to pay you. Thank you for creating this masterpiece. Do you have a PayPal or gift shop or some way I can give you money? I am not exaggerating. This is my Favorite Video from now on. God bless you
I hope this video won't make anyone.......TO DIE!
The Ending😂
Please don’t take too long for the next video 😭
It's a good video and all but i cant help but feel he can no longer be called "oversimplified" plus he chooses a topic no one asked for over something like anything roman related
I love everything about this video, and is that the Kerbal Space Program background music playing in the background throughout the video?!?!
Watch nord VPN give me a virus
As a Canadian who goes to Orcas Island every summer this video was wonderful.
When the guy spoke sheep I fell out of my chair
yesssss finally a new vid. I've been waiting for like 6 months!!!
The quality and writing of these gets better and better and better
The pig looks like waddles
OverSimplified is back!
babe wake up oversimplified just posted
Wow
You made an African day with that speech, in a second i felt like an American citizen and ready to fight for my country.
YAY A NEW ONE
Humbug back then was a major insult. It's pretty much calling the guy General Dumbfuck
۴فب
This is a masterpiece.
It’s… beautiful
3 on trending!!!
Finally your back now today is a good day
See you in 2030
HOORAY! I am so happy you're back!
FINALY.       ANOTHER ONE
That ending speech might be the Apex of Based
0 CANADIANS WERE HURT DURING THE MAKING OF THIS VIDEO
How about the 1857 Sepoy mutiny in India???? I would love for you to make it!!
Been waiting on a video for so long lol. Finally here
0:28 казалось бы, причём тут Россия
Ay yo we're learning about this
37:13 was so funny
Who else thought this was about the Vietnam war
Oh oversimplified, you think were done? The moose will haunt you forever!!! The Great White North will never surrender!!!!  Awesome stuff as always!!
lol... imagine Canada becoming a third world country with guns overnight.
Thaaaaank god a new episode
BUCHANAN!
Again with the Biden thing that guy couldn’t win a war against 2 shits rubbing together
0:46 'sigh' yeah that checks out...
Oversimplified you are the best
The Front cover just gets better and better
dont invade canada. we warned you
Oh boy! Can’t wait for all the “teacher/historian reacts” videos 😒   I’m tired of two things One: all the reaction videos I get in the recommended videos list every time I watch something from this channel  Two: all you dumb kids saying if he was your teacher you would be smarter, it’s your choice to not be engaged at school.
Whatever demon possessed OverSimplified during the last minute of this video… thank you for making me laugh 😂
37:19
This man has the cleanest ad transitions ever
At 36 min I was about to switch to another video but I waitedfor the ending and boy am I glad I did!
Straight line? Straight line.
OH EM GEE!!!  What a great take on that bit of history!?!  I almost choked trying to gasp for air after laughing so hard!  Thank you!
Stealing the flagpole just so the Americans couldn’t raise the flag, as a Brit, yes that is definitely something we would do Lmao
I’m not the ONLY one who sees this in their feed in the morning, and then saves it for dinner, right?
fact: all teachers should require we watch over simplified in history
THE... WHAT?!
spotted what?
Thank you for the shout out!
YESSSSSSS
2:38 Oh boy
One of the best motivational speeches ever
*oversimplified uploads* All of this enraged america, who punished Canada severely.
This is what happens when the Canadians piss off Oversimplified… *I N V A S I O N*
That was the greatest ending to a video I’ve ever seen
well let it git ready for other 5 months
Your the best am so smart now
Time to watch this 100 times now.
Me (a Washingtonian): I BEEN THERE
37 minutes of decent fun history, 60seconds at the end of pure American gold.
Fantastic ending.
The king is back!
AAAAYYY HE UPLAODED
can you do for more tiny countries like bulgaria or other?
Yaaasasasassasasasassas
What a great fucking video, truly a masterpiece of the internet. Thank you OverSimplified
HE UPLOADED
My favorite video by far. I was cracking up the entire time. Great freaking job dude!
Ending Speech: “Shit just went from 0 to 100 real quick”
AGREED! LETS GET CANADA AND THEIR OIL!!
Я русский. I Russian
Surprisingly your Video about Hitler isn’t restricted in Germany and I think never was.
Finally the king is back haha
8:42 Vietnam War Teaser on the Table!!!!
3:51 "I hear voices all the time!"  LMAO
Hunt looking like another H word lol        HITLER
Are we still on board for Vietnam war video? Its been almost 3 years
13:06-13:11  Well that escalated quickly
i KNEW IT
“Well I hear voices all the time”- some American in a church
well im Canadian and goodbye everyone, so GO AMERICA!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s great to see the style hasn’t changed and it’s still great. Love it, also informative which is always a plus
JUST A PIG? HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT MY GOD
OK those r going out of sale in the next few days...
I love he depicts manifest destiny with McDonald’s.
How much fun did you have with that last part?
Okayyyyyy........ anyone care to explain that ending ?
19:13 A better love story than Twilight
I has so happy when it came out but now that I’m done watching it I’m sad because I have to wait another 2-3 months for another video
The anti canadian sentiment at the end was unexpected lol
Legendary
If the us invade Canada it would immediately give up
Only Americans would say "So we fought this war against the British and the Canadians. They burned down our most important government building, so we'll just call it a draw."
aswome
technoblade: hold my beer
Welp time to learn
ENDING WAS HYSTERICAL 😂😂😂
- How much sobriety do you want to put in this video? - Nope!
As a Canadian I feel terrified, but then I look back on history and find our track record in war to be far superior
Ok but what about Canada?
I am sorry for looking at you James Douglas.
Ben Franklin “ oh Canada, so voluptuous…but look at those curves” Brits “I’d worry less about Canada’s curves, and more about your own curves” Everyone else “OOOOHHHHH” 🤣🤣🤣
Yay! I've been waiting for another video!!😁💕
SMUG NO STOP
I'm a Canadian and you Americans gotta calm down there😂👍
At the end of the prohibition video he says "maybe we're all a bunch of big dumb stinky idiots and we're aaaaalllllll doomed" a perfect example...... going at war because of the death of a PIG
vietnam coming soon
That speech at the end brought me to tears 😂
or nazi 3:30
Holly smokes a new video
a-characteristic ending but it was silly and it was good :b
VENGEANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!
uh sooooo things went high really quick
that last part just scream freedom
The USA won't invade Canada cause then they'd have to deal with Québec
Also people commenting "war over a pig" immagine if it was john wick's dog....
tbh i believe that's his funniest video yet
A war with Canada would be a smart way of improving the continent. Biden would declare war, immediately capitulate, and now Canadian law would apply everywhere. Or better yet, do it with Quebec instead :)
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! The Day of Return has Come!!! 😩😩😩😩😱😱😱😱😆😆😆😆😍😍😍😍😇😇😇😇😎😎😎😎🤩🤩🤩🤩🤤🤤🤤🤤
I am British and he punched the British I was laughing and the British won the war of 1812
The ending was 100% the best ending i seen on YouTube
Doing anything other than Vietnam
🙈🙉🙊 cant see try again
At least these two powers never went to war over the shooting of a Greek man chasing his dog into Bulgarian land
christmas has come early
Your back
The pig is waddles recolored from gravity falls lol.
Well I’m convinced. Let’s take over Canada boys
You do realize the purchase of Alaska was part 1 of a three part plan to unite the entire continent under a single Washington based government. Part one: Alaska, part 2: Greenland, part 3: everything in between. President trumps idea to buy Greenland was not a fluke out of nowhere it was an old idea proposed much earlier
That speech at the end actually got me fired up to invade Canada 👍
Some would say the war got off "Scott" free.
yes yes the plushies..... NOW WHERES MY YOUTOOZ!!!!!
I thought to myself "Pickett? Pickett? Where have I heard that name before?" And then as soon as he said Pickett's charge I out loud screamed "THAT Pickett?!?"
You should do a oversimplified video about the Vikings.
Its the duty of USA to give Canadians some much needed "freedom".
Hes not dead!
This was very educational and fun! I'm happy this video was backed with NordVPN!
hes back
YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS NEW UPLOAD
Can you do the Balkan wars please? If you want
HE UPLOAD
Canada 🇨🇦 history
Its strange that oversimplified has emotion's now and it scares me
He’s back
"i didn't say they were WHITE people"  very spicy.
rip canada
Anyone else think the ghost of Harney took him over for that ending?
US - Canda war of 2022 Oversimplified coming soon
This is the bast movie
And when the world needed him the most, he returned.
The ending of this video was so funny! Great video overall though!!
37:08 *this is the greatest cinematography in the history of the world*
hey could you do a video on the 1916 easter rising? im irish and i would love to see a video on irish history, and thats where it all started.
Finally I'm so happy
That was so funny 🤣 thank you.
ive been waiting for this so long, the joke at the end killed me tho 😂
I would love to see a video done on the Vietnam War!, especialy since there are not many videos that go through the whole conflict like you guys go aswell as with your humour!  ps:you even alluded to it in your cold war video :)
Can we all acknowledge the Voice of Morgan Freeman for the pig XD
Thank you for the new video, I enjoy watching  your videos.
Hog rider!!
how was the idiot guy still a general?
This video came in the worst day of my life.Thank you oversiplified for making it better.
Next video will probably be uploaded in June, 2022.
OOOOOOHHHH NEW VIDEO UPLOADED
Technoblade causing chaos again it seems
1. Yay another Oversimplified video.  2. You want to invade Canada bring it on, and after we win the war a second time and burn the white house to the ground a second time we're taking Alaska.
This is #2 on trending! :D
less cringe pls
DA KING IS BACK
dang i really want to start a war now  IF ONLY I HAD NORDVPN THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CANADA FOR MY LIFE WIOTH JUST A FEW CLICKS i love making no sense and i am def not drunk
oversimplified and Kurzaget uploaded on the same day? its The best Day ever.
Canada for the WIN 🇨🇦
god yes a new video
The goat is back
Since the dawn of civilization humans have expanded and consolidated land and territories. The Romans, Greeks, Persians, Chinese, mongols, Kush, Mesopotamian, various European states and others have all expanded through warfare and supremacy to fill their desire for a large territory, why is it any different that America did it? It’s not our fault they failed to secure their land.. it’s what happened and will continue to happen since the dawn of civilization.
The british is basically a technoblade stan
I am British.
Could you do Mexico’s Independence for September 16 of the next year? maybe…? (ò - ō)
5 seconds later a the Manifest Destiny war occurs between USA and Canada
Oversimplified is a better teacher then half of the teachers at my school
Just wanted to mark my attendance.  “Present” 🤓
I actually live just up the road from Fort Vancouver and passed it every day on my way to school for years, so this was hilarious for me XD
What's the song? 26:50
not now babe, new oversimplified video dropped
is that KSP i hear?
But why they didn't agree on a possible term where one side buys the island? they had alreay bought much larger territories. I mean, if a country isn't willing to spend money to get some territories that can't be invaded, then this country doesn't really want them, and therefore it should just sell them. I guess they never agreed on a price, or who should sell.
3:33 Even OverSimplified agrees that Florida is America's penis.
20 hrs and already 2 million views.
Ooo I can tell that this'll be a pig one.
You should change the name of your channel to OverComplicated
I usually skip in video ads. But oversimplified usually manages to keep them interesting. Well done
Go ahead invade Canada see what happens yanks. Cause the full British might will come down on you
HES BACK BABY
He’s back !!!
Very happy to see the Pig War! It isn’t talked about much. I can’t wait for the next Oversimplified video!
2 words. LOVE. IT.
this is the best channel ever. We need some more detailed multi-part foreign history videos!
Glad hes dropped this video,next one should be out by summer next year 🧒🧒🧒
WHAT WAS THAT ENDING AAHAHHAHAH?!?!?!?!?
So Australia had the Emu War and America had the Pig War. Both started because farmers were sick of their crops being eaten, both were absolutely blown out of proportion, and both could have been prevented if the farmers thought of building fences. I know, it's crazy isn't it?
The practice of giving some juicy "freedom" to foreign lands by USA started from the very founding of itself. Wow!!🤣🤣
Congrats on trending!!!
The king is back
So this was the inspiration for Ozzy Osborn War Pigs!!
Can Canada just take over USA already?
Another great video! He is so funny and he analyses so well!!
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS its been too long! Love the video <3
Yay another video!
WOOOOOO YEAH BABY THATS WHAT IV BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
4:41 As a straight Native American, I sure love beavers too.
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤯💥
pi to
Babe wake up! Oversimplified just posted
Oh my gosh a new video
I bought that plushy so fast that I “accidentally” bought two
You know, you're right, we deserve to own canada.
I un ironically want to invade Canada now
16:00 INTRUDER ALERT RED SPY ON THE BASE!
That ending was just beautiful.   Bidens coming…
Christmas has come early
This video is probably the funniest thing I've seen all month...  Also HIT THE JAMS, BOYS! WE GOIN' TO CANADA!
I see a new Oversimplified, I clic and watch. I'm oversimple man.
Maan please uplode more  I love your vids
I don’t know what the Canadians were complaining about, New Zealand gets talked about far less!!
here from canada. just wondering what about Alaska? and the city Point Roberts connected only to canada but belongs to usa
He kinda' went off the deep end at the end there. I like him. Let's encourage him.
anyone else think that Charlie sounded like Morgan Freeman
God I missed these so much
Loved the ending
Man this got                   Political
You know... you can release the Vietnam war oversimplified any time now
Franklin getting burned was so funny
I broke my phone screen with how hard I smashed like. This was absolutely glorious.
do syrian civil war
FINALLY!
Isn't James Buchanan considered the worst President ?
Lord Jizzingham and the 518008 calculation had me in fits LOL
THIS IS TRENDING !!!
Well what can l say to properly complement growth of this channel and since his so enthusiastic to take  Canada  he should have honor to plan the offensive 🤣
I am moving to Cananda to prepare the defenses.
The ending with Canada! 🤣
Straight line?
4:11 *Insert "'America, F'K Yeah" here*
Biden will either be dead or been booted from the whitehouse by the time that would become and reality...
YESSSSSS
Best part of the video 13:06
7:58 - 8:01  *I see what you did there! Very clever*
I really enjoyed the subtle smash mouth reference!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.                                                                          !!!
Can you make a video about balkan war im 90s
dont stress my dear Canadian friends, the UK will turn America into an atomic wasteland if they try it on with you.
That was quick.
goat war: are we are joke to you?
Bro why his eye glass fall in his tea! 😭💀
Did the US just use OverSimplified to announce we're at war with Canada? That's style if I've ever seen it.
I SAW THE TITTLE AND I HAD BEACON SO I DRANK SOME WATER AND THEN WATCHED THE VIDEO. WE DID NOT REGRET THE BEACON.
Veitnam wen
"Then you should use nord VPN" what the fu....
All Canadians watching the ending:  *Confused screaming and sweating profusely*
“Some believe it was their destiny to spread like disease or rats “is pretty accurate to America
Okay this now one my favorite video by oversimplified
This was the funniest Oversimplified video yet!
By golly! Hey guys! Let's all start going to Canada!
"Surrender, Pronto. Or we'll level Toronto." Lol!
you appear to have let loose
Us Germans decided to which country the islands belonged to? WHAT A TWIST!
YAY
I've been to San Juan Island, lovely place, nice people, fantastic environment and wildlife, me and my brother chased a Boar through some woods, even went to a Rodeo which is pretty wild for a 10 year old English lad.  I am English, but guess which Camp is genuinely nicer English Camp. American Camp is a bit more rough looking and their beach is just stones, seemed an unloved piece of land. English Camp was green and prestine, though the condition of American Camp could have changed in 19 years. Nice place, I'd advise people visit it! Couldn't say it was much like the American main land
4:02-4:15 lmao manifest destiny in a nutshell
I fucking loved the ending
Can you do the scottish wars of independence next
God bless America eh? Listen here bucko you want be taking Banff or our mapple syrup away from us any time soon buddy   All jokes aside that speech was amazing lol
bruh these people were creative! i mean what's next brocoli war??
The Russians would call this the war of Ukraine XD
25:15
that outro though lmao I lost it when he said "and the endless comments that I don't talk about Canada enough in my videos"
my boi is back
AAAAAAAA HE POSTED!!!! I'VE WAITED FOR IT SOOOO LOOONG! LUUUUVVV YOU  *no homo*
The manifest destiny is like the American dream with a little genocide added for flavour
Boring.
This is your best yet, but could I humbly ask if you'd consider doing an episode on some part of Japanese history next or just in the future? I mean, you've covered China, so I feel like a skip across the East China Sea to Sunrise Land isn't a stretch.
Were comin' for ya canada
I’m from Canada 🇨🇦
Guality over cuantity is True in over simplified.
As a British person, I must say this was a great video. Also respect to today's America
14:36 is beautiful
He is back bois
I clicked so fast on this tbh I missed watching these videos
This is the greatest video you guys have ever done ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
nice beats
Realtalk he has fully the right for Product Placements cause he makes it sooooo funny.
Yaaaaaaas yooour back
Ok I've seen a lot of weird wars like the War of the Bucket in 15th Century Europe and the Emu War in Australia but come on America, I thought we were better than this! XD  Also to be clear, the sponsorship for NordVPN is hilarious and I somehow always look forward to this in every OverSimplified video! XD
That Morgan Freeman Voice omg, that absolutely got me😅😅
General Harney’s actions upset General Scott, who punished him severely.
can you do spanish american war next
Though the video I can't help but to feel kinda bad for the British, they just got their asses kicked and every negotiation afterwards is basically the US telling them to fuck off (and getting away with it as well).
USA USA USA
DOWN WITH CANADIAN!
Oversimplified McDonalds video coming 2022 XD
i love that you *invest* your voice more in those videos, it makes you sound more human, History-BOT 1410.
The Pig *ALMOST* War
I was not ready for the last 90 seconds, but shall perform my American duty by taking my average 1.25 guns per citizen and report to the front lines post haste.  Please send winter provisions.... Thanks!
W
Best time of the year it's when Oversimplified uploads, not Christmas!
This whole historical event was a lose - lose situation in my eyes.
Griffin's ecstatic face when spending time with his beloved pig is the stuff of nightmares
The rare days when Oversimplified uploads, these will never be topped
MY MAN
7:58 That smash mouth reference. Sweet.
you could do a video about  Prague spring or Czechoslovakia legion in Russia
Was really hoping for the Vietnam War but this is fine
Yes finally
Straight line?
When the world needed him most, he returned
You make history the best! Keep on your great work
The nord vpn demon is back
Please do make a video on the Indian Freedom History, Will be beneficial for your channel and also be beneficial for the whole world to know how the brits tormented Indians. Thank-you.
Great video
I’m amazed how America continues to get away with stuff that would have ended other countries with such frequency.
An excellent video as always sir, the was perfect...
Honestly I’m not gonna lie, the  Napoleonic wars video was way better. I am not going to say this was a bad video by any means I am just stating the fact that this video, this war wasn’t on the level most oversimplified videos are on these days. Napoleonic wars I have watched like 20 times but for this, one maybe two but that is more than enough.   All I will say is I think selecting the pig war over stuff like the war in nam or most wars for that matter is a bad call. I still think it was a good video but it could’ve been a 100 times better.
Pls Karánsebes war
I feel these videos are starting to have TOO MUCH comedy in them. They used to have accurate info done in a comedic way. Now it is 90% made up comedy bits with 10% actual facts.
The ending made me wanna invade Canada in the name of USA.   And I'm not even from USA
FUCK YES PLS UPLOAD MOREEE OMG
OverSimplified. Please add hungary text. Very godd animation
Ayy new video
I missed you
1369 i've killed 5x that in a day
Where were you
You WILL make a stuffy of the PIG!!
finally a new video i was waithing 6 months
Damn it. No Vietnam, yet... Great vid either way.
I think he gets more insane with the more research he does on this topic. I want to now discuss history, and see how, hmm, not sane these animations can get. Right, Douglas, we will have Vancouver Islands, please…
just masterpiece.
I never heard Oversimplified yell so loud before
U are back ☺️
I love being British and watching these videos
Oversimplified you mad lad Canada is ours and there is nothing they can do
I guenuinely burst into flames. And i m not even english nor american.
my cousin lives on San Juan island; i’m gonna send this to her!
Hello Oversimplefied, I waited till after the work to watch this video. The toppic was very interesting and suprising and your interpretarion was as allways very creative. I only think this time, the jokes where a bit to much and to long. Some length less in some parts would have done the video a bit better, I think. But like I sayd, that's just how I see it. It's still a  great video about a historical event, I hadn't known before. And as a big Star Wars Fan, I like the thumbnail.
10/10 ending would watch again. signed by a canadian who lives on vancouver island
Best Advert transition ever👏
Our U.S. Ansestors wernt that smart.
Now we wait for another 6 months ughhh
I love when the pig just goes full Morgan Freeman right before he’s shot.
Bro this dude so cool he finna make afourteen show up to the first half of the recording
The last speech was fucking amazing, I wanna take over Canada
nice
damn so funny
Oversimplified should do The Irish and British wars
Could you do italy risorgimento next time?
Number 3 on trending
Bageutte
I was waiting for soooooo long...
great video but you should do one on the Irish revulsion one
5:56 demonetised
great video but you should do one on the Irish revulsion one
21:26 - I didn’t know Mikael Akerfeldt was a 19th century American general!
Nah let’s be real, with a civil war and the involvement of the Brits, we might have had an extra country in North America
woo
28:11 LET THEM KISS!
Holy maple leaf. That ending joke about the world's biggest terrorist organization invading one of the greatest countries in the world was really scary. Good thing you can't refine maple syrup into gasoline... yet...
WOW NEW VIDEO, LOVE YA PAL!
What in the gods name was yhe last oary
Biden's only coming to shit and eat ice cream
Canadian, here. Americans who try to invade end up applying for Canadian citizenship.
Imagine this guy as ur History teacher
holy smokes! That ending was hilarious! I laughed so hard that my siblings came to see what happened. And now they're choking on their own laughter!
25:00 time limit challenge untill next day
The ending was wild lmao
Finaly :D
Alright, my lunch break just got a little more interesting.
07:58 hey now, you're an American. Take that land now, go play.
Canada is like that nice quiet dude nobody ever notices but if the bully america would pick on him everyone would jump in and fuck you up  Greeting from The Netherlands
Didnt the US try to invade Canada at one point but fail miserably?
YAY FINALY
see you in a year
Now THATS how you end a video
i would just like to say that the "rat" at 3:42 is actually a gerbil. that is all
European wars of religion when?
ANEX CANADA!  FALLOUT TIME LINE NOW
"What the f" Perfectly cut :D
When the world needed him the most, he came back.
I don’t ever know what the pig war is. I just love oversimplified videos.
my new favorite one loved it
I have a vid idea The Great Irish Famine
ok good to know         he has gone insane
The one time I'm against America is this war. I'm American
This video is top tier quality. So good to see oversimplified improve voice acting and animation over the years
Less than a day and it already has over 2 million views.
Captien harney is like your druk uncle

"I hear voices all the time"

Unreal content
Dude Chill lmao
Can you do arab spring of 2011 oversimplified?
Keep on the good work man
Where do you get your sources of information?
Yyyyyaaaaaa oversimplified
after 6 months the 🐐 is back
Tomorrow's Fox headlines: Canadian Justin Trudeau (a transsexual man) murders American pig (name: Steve Bacon) on American Vancouver Island! All-American Steve was merely excersizing his Second Amendment right to openly carry his AR-15s on what is rightfully American soil, when a nosy transsexual prime minister confronted him. When Bacon refused to disarm, leaving him at the mercy of a horde of illegal Canadian immigrants, Trudeau allegedly threatened to vaccinate him, and claimed current president Donald Trump has tiny hands. "I had to defend myself and stand my ground." Bacon was quoted as saying "It was slightly before noon, so I couldn't see well, but I think there may have been ANTIFA rioters in the crowd. Also, the island is American so those Cannuck have no reason to complain!". A Fox poll indicates 90% of True Americans stand behind Steve, 2% say "Go to war with France!", and the remainder found Canada on a map.
Wow your videos have improved so much since the beginning. I always get excited to see you post new content!
Like rats or disease?  I used to really like listening to these but American self hated is getting old. A lot of people are sick of hearing about the poor Indians. Ok so then we must cry tears for every conquered people in the history of the world. Let us cry for the ancient Britons. Those mean evil Normans invading and replacing them. No country in history has been so powerful yet so benevolent. After WW2 The soviets decided not to leave. We fought and died for The French against Germany. And then left.
what if you wanted to settle in a quiet remote island but god said YEEEEEE HAAAAW (gunshots)
I thought this video might lead more directly into the Civil War video like some of the other videos with ww2
"The Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, they hopped into their wagons and hit the ground running!" -OverSimplified
once again the peak of my month has come ANOTHER VIDEO lets goooooooooooo
Make one about the Greek revolution!
Dude... i love your videos so damn much! This actually beat the "Emu Wars" in both length, laughs and just SHEER STUPIDITY!  In honor of the dumbass dispute over the islands of SAN JUAN i say "Gracias Amigo" ^^
The Return of the king
Charlie did the best voice he could possibly do for the pig. It had me laughing like never before
0:59 "Independence" is spelled wrong. 1:46 "separating" is spelled wrong. Conclusion: video editing software needs spellcheck.
With a soooo good video i d’ont need to see how many dislikes it got
Boy you're back
Throw in some onions and some dairy cows and we could have called it the "Loaded baked potato War."
The return of the king
Great to see another video
Well then… looks like oversimplified has declared war
THE RETURN OF THE KING
Finally🤩
LMAO I’m Canadian and that absolutely killed me🤣🤣🤣
hes back nordvpn is sponsoring oversimplified again and we have the legendary *pig war*
Never lose your sense of humour!
Yay you post a another video
finally a new vid
Aw jeez, the US wouldn't stand a chance with Biden as the Commander-In-Chief
It's funny because I live in Vancouver and have a friend named James Douglas. Our high-school was Hudsons Bay and we go to the old fort in the middle of the night to smoke weed in the community garden outside the front gate. Solid depiction of the fort, looks just like irl.
finaly
Omg it is already 6 months I have waited for so long but it’s totally worth it
FINALLYYYYY6Y66YYYY6YYYYYY
I dIdNt SaY tHeY WeRe WhItE pEoPle!  Bruh that clearly didn't stop us when the br*tish were in the way of westward expansion.
Oversimplified lost it…
Banger as always
That ending made my day 😂😂🔥
33:29 Jesus Christ you didn't have to beat the man
This guy is awesome, but i'm waiting for the Vietnam war.

Every day is a happy day when a new OverSimplified video comes out.
Do the pastry war next!

7:15 SPOTTED DICK? SPOTTED DICK! Who came up with that name deserves…    A reward for his contribution on making the world a better place!
12:55 *CALL ME CRAZY AGAIN AND I'LL EAT YOUR EYES*
When i saw this… Y-E-S Y-E-S Y-E-S

“It’s my density.”
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO!
Canada is basically America-lite anyway the diet coke of this country
I'm sorry, but is this Morgan Freeman at 31:08?
I like the new moving animations
Now that we covert Canada...Can you do Switzerland?
holy crap, ever since he put the us flag over the canadian one in that one video hes been hiding this plan.
Yeeeeeees
Laughing so hard I'm in tears, lol
7:58 So we're just not gonna talk about how he did an All star reference?
Each video just gets better than the last, and the last one was really damn good, love the consistent quality
I still want that Vietnam War oversimplified
As a Canadian, I fear  2025 Edit: War of 1812 Part 2? 👀
HIDDEN EASTER EGG ON 15:47 LOOK LEFT FOR THE AMERICAN GUY AND LOOK AT THE TABLE. It is a picture of North and South Vietnam. Oversimplified mentioned in the cold war video that he may make a video of the war.
You should make a video about Ottomans man, you are tallented.
Im so happy that you are back
OMFG HE UPLOADED FINALLY i was almost failing history
Ne w video!
"woah woah woah i didn't say they were white people!" Oversimplified presents racism!
His delivery has gotten so much better compared to some earlier videos
American overconfidence almost bit them in the arse this time
How about some videos about Greece?
As a hardline modern Secessionist/0.04% part Cherokee, I absolutely find this hilarious, great video Oversimplified (By the way, I live in Washington state lol)
Is Pickett modelled after Ian McCollum from forgotten weapons?
Saving the end of this video for the 2024 election 😂😂
CANADA DELENDA EST
If that wasn't the most perfect ending to this video, I don't know what is
I'm going to be very honest with you. It literally took me a while to see this video since yesterday, because I was studying, but when I finished my exam, I was able to see it. I think listening to the final speech, I was a little disappointed. I've read in the comments about "Best Oversimplified Speech" and things like that. And I expected it to be a speech like the final speech of the Abraham Lincoln video. Now I will be much more suspicious of American sarcasm. The first time it was a terrible disappointment. However, seeing the ending a second, third and fourth time made me see the bright side and literally that ending is the funniest and most inspiring in the most humorous sense of the word of all your videos. Yes, it was a good video. Marvelous. Congratulations. Get on with what you do. Good luck. Greetings from Peru. Edit: Ok, I admit I didn't like the final so much, but the rest of the video is wonderful. Good job.
Americans watching this: Are we the baddies?
when i saw that you had made a new video i was blown out of my brain :)
SECOND ON TRENDING!!! Great job and your videos are legendary Ive wached every one.
Pls do yugoslav wars
Finally
yes finaly

#1 ON TRENDING Nice!
I wath the merch thing so bad, but i can't! I run out of space.
You must love NordVPN sponsorships because that ad guy is honestly a pretty cleverly designed character.
I laughed so much! I wish I could have super liked the video. Fantastic work and super informative
7:56 Is that All Star by Smash Mouth?
You don't talk enough about Denmark in your video's about American stuff we own Greenland include us!!!!
Hard to imagine that this is actual history
Didi Also offers
Ah!! OverSimplified video after 6 months! It's a good day! ❤️
LOOOOLLLLLLLL!!!11!!!1! XREC REFURINSE!!!!! 7:58
What's with humanity and our obsession with land and starting wars over basically nothing?
oh yes its here. canada oh yes with britain roasting america in your support
I fricken love this channel so GD much
the ending was the most American ending ever
I am just now noticing that the Nord ad guy has the Nord logo on his head.
Are you gonna make video about polish-bolshewik war?
I thought you where talking about the Tecnoblade one🤦‍♂️
What was that ending?!  XD
You heard him boys, let's go after Canada.
anyone else get potato vibes
Should do a video on the Mexican American war and the Texas Revolution! Would perfectly tie in perfectly with this video about American expansion westward.
We’ll send emus to defend Canada.
when will you make the vietnam war with america
Talk about Norway more PWESSSE PRETTY PWEEESSSE
Why don't you make one (or two) about the Balkan Wars?
the people who disliked this video are not funny

Yessssssss finally  viddeeeeeeooooooo
God told me last night to invade Canada
Like rats or disease 💀
7:58 SOOOOOOOOOME BODY WAAAS TOLD ME

Fucking loved the ending
This was the single strangest video I've ever seen but I enjoyed it
What the fuxk
Yay!!!! A new episide!!!!!!
Ok
"jizzingham"
LETS GO BRANDON‼️‼️‼️
I find it really cool that in this video, Winfield Scott comes off as more of a competent general than he did in the Civil War videos, where he just seemed overly cautious. Shows that there's more to a military man's legacy than one conflict.
I don't know why the second instance of him yelling no broke me but it did in laughing to death over here
I like watching your videos nore than watching vidoes of games
FINALLYYYYYYYY
Lets hope that the end of video will not start a war
freaking americans always have to be the ones to say the last word
My guy went crazy in the last 3 minutes
I love your videos but what's with the ending? Not cool man even as a joke. Just look at the harneys going at it in the comments
I missed you guys welcome back 😊
Oversimplified Day Is A Good Day
Been waiting 6 months for new content and The Pig War delivers!
yay a new oversimplified video
Wow. If that war had happened, maybe the south would've won because we would've been wasting resources fighting the greatest naval power of the day
I haven’t seen him with so much energy ever
19 hours ago 2M views You sir have made it , am proud to be here since WW1!
Captain Hornby you beautiful beautiful man !
Welcome back after 2 years oversimplified
I’ve waited so long for you to post a new video
When you look at manifest destiny and lebensraum side by side, there isn’t much difference…
Oversimplified: *calls for an invasion of Canada* This enrages Canada, who punished him severely
The king has returned
He is back
you just completely ignored the spanish of your story
Is that Kerbal Space Program music I hear all over this video?
Christmas came early
#3 on trending hot damn
Finally here 😁😁
>Be me >browsing 4chan >Oversimplified uploads >Goodbye frens.
Holy shit this whole "war" was just one overly long bruh moment
history as imagined by snowflakes
Oversimplified made so much videos about history that he's about to make history.
4:10 That was awesome.
37:11 YOU'RE GOD DAMN RIGHT WE SHOULD! YEE-HAW CHUCKLE-FUCKS WE'RE COMIN' YA MAPLE SYRUP, PLAD-WEARIN, CHEESE AND GRAVY EATIN' PIECES A MOOSE MEAT!!!!! WE'RE COMIN' FOR THAT 51ST STATE BOI!!!!!!!!!

The legend is back
37:19 ok
AYOOOO
So you’re telling me that a pig getting shot lead to one of the most notable moments in the Civil War, during the Battle of Gettysburg?
Better not cry because Bidens coming to town.
Piggy
I absolutely love how Germany was the one that ended this
What a legendary video
The end was pretty cool but not a good idea
Why did they give the additional land to the Americans at the end of the war of independence?
God bless America
These are great they should b used in skool I'd have done history if it'd been taught like dis
Yeeeeees
THERE BACK AFTER 6 MONTHS
TO DIE
Can you do the Algerian war ?. 👍
One nation, under Drake
Alright my fellow canadian beavermen and womens, time to prepare to destroy a third american invasion on our soii.
I’ve been waiting for this for months praise the severely punishing father
It's so crazy how these videos are getting better, funnier and weirder every time. Totally worth waiting for!
Luv ur vids can u make a ottoman vid
make ottoman wars/atatürk history
Oof...guys please don't start a war with Canada just for more land, it's not worth it, it would also lead to several issues lol
viewers: vietnam or russian civil war oversimplified: pig war viewers: *WE'LL TAKE IT*
It sounds great, you americans should do it before it's too late and Canada becomes a superpower x) (Québec may help you)
I have been waiting
11:55 nice.
Thought this was about the bay of pigs invasion not Gunna lie
Bruh the best of the best. I always laugh and learn watching these videos
Wait there's a Hit**r Video?!?! I don't see it.... Nein Nein Nein Greetings from Germany :D
Lol watching the pig walk, like step by step, was weird. Like, these characters have legs?
Can't wait to see the American Civil war oversimplified in 50 years!
O
O
Me a Canadian:          oh shit
Is that a Vietnam war foreshadowing I see at 15:40
Yayyyy, another video from this guy...
Oversimplified posted, my day is made!
Holy shit i can't wait for more of this. Your content is just getting from awesome to magnificent
This channel consistently produces brilliant videos but this is Probably the best video yet 👌 perfection

Appreciate the attention to detail by including Mt Rainier and Mt Hood when showing the PNW!
Let’s goooo finally a upload
The end just... Flawless  MMMH Good And yes I (As a European) agree that America should just invade Canada because i really dont give a damn (And maybe the Americans can learn something from them) BUT its ok... Its ok Where is my Wiener Schnitzel
finally one of the best animators of all time.
This video was something else man:))
I can't wait for the future video detailing the American invasion of Canada, brought on by a YouTube video.
God Bless America. Yes sir
Yeeees
Picket looks like Ian from forgotten weapons
Please do stuff about Ireland

You've been doing some poetry OverSimplified guy?
Great video looking forward to more
31:02 sounds like the guy from the Lego movie 😂
Ohh how I’ve missed you.
Only 8 minutes in, but damn you've upped your writing game even further with this one. Absolutely brilliant so far. 🤣
Lets go a new funny upload thanks mate
Number 35 trending here in the Philippines.
I rarely comment on videos but this one is the best this channel has ever put out lol. Fucking amazing.
I WAITED 6 MONTHS FOR THIS?!??!!?!?
The thirteen colonies were troublesome and offered little income to the empire, the population wanted independence, and it was trouble keeping them in line, France was salty after losing the war with us just a few years before and therefore took the side of the US.   France had managed to re-arm VERY quickly and therefore posed a threat to us if we decided to keep the colonies,   France also wanted other countries that disliked the British as allies so the US was very useful to them.   Because of the fact that the us was on the other side of the world to the rest of the empire, offered little income and was nothing but trouble, we moved out
Hi @OverSimplified I would like to ask you kindly to choose The great balkan wars as your next topic, because I live in the Balkans and I’d like to learn more about that historical event. If you see this comment pls consider this idea.
XAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXA
Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd: *Dies after causing the failure of the German Empire and then meets Bismarck in the hereafter, perfectly knowing that the German Empire was his precious project and that he even predicted the end of WW1* Bismarck right after he notices Wilhelm: 33:29  But no, seriously. That scene is bomb and has so much meme potential
By the laws of John Wick, Griffin was justified to go on a rampage
Only the brits are smart enough to use nordvpn 😆
pig.
But the the US get those sweet sweet taxes?
can you do the Irish rebelion?
I....had no idea these islands even existed. They ain't on the map so I can tell who won the pigwar.
God bless America 🇺🇸
It's like the cold war but in the 19th century.
PLEASE DO MORE OF THIS. I LOVE UR CHANNEL
As a Canadian, I'd personally kill myself at the end of this video
So, Vietnam war will not Get made?
The Goat is back
NEW VID LEZ GOOO
I love the small details, like how the ending is foreshadowed in the browser history "Drake for President" during the NordVPN ad
As a American I don’t support nations. Not even my own I don’t support wars. I believe in world peace  unity where we all as human stand United.  The quote “the flags may be different but methods are the same” ring true. We must be carful of blindly following a country cause that leads to war. I’m aware the world won’t simply unify that easy  cause if it did then there wouldn’t be war and some people love war.   Love and peace to everyone regardless of country. I don’t believe in nations. I believe in world peace unity where people won’t look differently of each other based off country
OverSimplified is my favorite YT channel
❤❤❤
I'm crying I'm laughing so hard at the end of the vid...
LETS GO RIGHT NOW BRING IT ON!!!
after years u made a vid
This was a masterpiece
This is excellent. Also, video ideas 💡  1. The Vietnam war 2. The English civil war 3. Something on the Roman empire 4. The 100 year war 5. The 7 year war Love your content, bye!
31:10 is that morgan freeman
Do the war of 1812 next...
Lyman shouldve keep quiet n eat the pig...
I'm thinking a blockade would be easy and sufficient, then we steal their health care system and liquidate the private health insurance racket.
I've still not started the video, just came here to express my excitement for a new Oversimplified video!! Finally!
#1 on trending :D
This is literally 2 on trending
What is the pig war
Finally, a new video 🎉
Griffin’s pig be like: “I’ll take a potato skin and EAT IT!!”
1:53 look at the map on the table... is he teasing his next video on the Vietnam War?
Why is every animal now have a war about it?
Omg what an ending 🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Thank you
Serbia?
I love these videos
I waited for this so long
Me the whole video: “Oh man, we have down some horrible things in the past (especially to the natives) huh?” Me, at the end: “F*CK YEAH I LOVE THE USA SUCK IT CANADIANS MANIFEST DESTINY FOR LIFE, ALL WILL BE AMERICA, NO MORE RED AND WHITE FLAG, NO MORE STUPID LEAF, GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!”
YES
A new upload from oversimplified always makes my day btw @OverSimplified you make history so much easy to understand using so freakinn funny jokes and animation
Try it US, we'll burn the White House down again
Can you do a video about Denmark 🌯
32:45
What an Ending 😂😂😂😂
He's not dead YAY!
Ew not the americans in our country. Lol
Me waiting untill Amerika tries to invaid Sweden-
This has to be one of the best youtube videos ever 😅😅
Probably one of the best parts of these videos is the seamless ad transitions
Im pretty sure there must be at least 1 video worthnof content in canada's history
If Biden sees this video he will think he actually said that he will come for Canada
As a Canadian...come get some...I'd love to see old man Biden take on Drama teacher Trudeau...I can see the slap fight now
BEST VIDEO
Britain : stops an invasion and burns down capital city America : DRAW?🥺
That was an amazing ending 🤣
Kurzgesagt and Oversimplified: two of the best YT channels
This is incredible, from start to finish !
WTF WAS THAT ENDING HSHHSHSHSHHSHSHSHS
Last monologue was hilarious 😂😂😂
That ending was so chaotic I fucking love.
It's cool to learn history about a place i've lived my entire life. Normally, US History boils down to being only about the east coast and the south until Hollywood existed, so to hear a historian say stuff like "Columbia River" and "Fort Vancouver" as if I didn't live 5 minutes away from both of them is kinda neat and weird at the same time.
Wtf dude,post more videos and more often.....waited for so long it's annoying lol
27:26 *what is this, a color change for ants?*
americans really havent changed all that much, have they?
You posted exactly when I had a history exam, what a coincidence.
Animation at 33:30 was really good!
Or you can snuggle me.
Lets make the word a better place Just as god intended...(utter mayhem) 100%accurate...God wills it
Damn your videos are amazing
I think you should talk about the Polish Lithtiuan  Commuathen formation
lets fing go
DUDE.......      not cool
Nobody's talking about the "white people" joke in the beginning, so hilarious! That and "U-S-Eh" Hahaha!
I was worried for his mental health at the end of the video
31:02 Bruh That pig sounded like an old Leonard Nimoy
USA! USA! USA!
Idea for a video: war of 1812
commenting for the algorithm
we 100% need a Mexican American war video
I watched this last night after i took my sleep meds, and I legitimately thought the ending was a hallucination. I was wrong.
The pig war?
This entire video is American - Canadian jokes. And I love it!
Why does America always get what they want 😭
British - trying multiple times to be reasonable and not start a war   Americans- hehe guns, pride we big man!!   Apart from general winfield he cool
istg this is the best history channel bruh
I have been waiting for ever
LETS GO he has UPLOADED
The end is too funny😂😂
3:42 Like Rats, Or Disease  XD still true to this day
Biden is coming eh? Sorry, but are kids aren't stupid enough to let that old dustbin put his paws on em. Plus if target failed what makes you think you can succeed? That's right I'm saying your country is comparable to Target
Missed opportunity to say, "Biden's coming! And this time, he's coming for thee!"
what in heck was that ending
Yay your not dead
Someone plz animate oversimplified Canadian American War rant
the British never seemed to get the hang of drawing arbitrary borders. also; I hope you're being monitored by a 'round-the-clock team of therapists.
Yes, new vid. Lets goooooo
It's all fun and games until Biden gets ANGY
A legend returns
3:37 so if west america is america ass florida is…
Who doesn't like a good old burned white house
I havent watched the video yet, but this better be good cuz we waited a looong time for this.
Deam meybe i weit 1000 year but its worted !!! Just keep doing this !
YES
Amazing
The king has posted
Me at the end of the video: **U S A, U S A, U S A, U S A**
"But being an American meant that he amerged with 4 pistols and a giant knife"        "But being Americans meant that they pulled guns on him"     "He even threatened to shoot him him self"
0:32 looks like a flag of Russia. America backwards is acirema. Sounds like ilness. Who was ill? Turkey! Sick man of Europe. Turkish capital was Istanbul. Who else wanted this city? Russia. America is Russia. Prooved.
It just need Manifest Destiny look a bit south.
I wonder where Alaska came from
But... It wasn't a war....
Do a video on the Irish Revolution
ahhhhhhh this video made me so proud to be American,USA baby
you've clearly never seen the canadians in combat, and how much some are itching to punch america
Yugoslav wars?
Love your vids bro!   never change :)
3:50 "I hear voices all the time-"
You really went above and beyond in the video, honestly one of the best
Your voice sounded just fine in previous videos, you don't need to force it sound bass and deep every sentence.
I live in Metro Vancouver, and have somehow never heard of the Pig War. Hell, I never thought British Columbia would ever be mentioned.
Man i have been waiting this for months
Why don’t you do the Vietnam war
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
I thought this was a video on technoblade.
yes yes  oversimplified
Been waiting for this for ages and is a good wait.
Every Oversimplified video is like a family reunion, everyone eager to come together to enjoy a story told by that one very cool uncle or grandpa. Great videos, without fail.
The way schools teach history is pathetic. There are so many events that I've learned from youtube instead of school. This is one of them.
Hey OverSimplified can you make a video about the war of Etsawini please?
All your videos are hilarious but this has got to have been your best one yet
Finaly a video
I could watch griffin dance with his pig for hours
I love oversimplified
A steam ship named "Steamy McSteamface" is exactly why im here :)
18:40 sad:(
What the hell? Are we that petty?
Think this is the best oversimplefied vid yet
One of the BEST films on this chanel
poor piggy man...
Think you should do ottoman
Nice
Yeeee haaaaaaww
LOL nice way into nordvpn ad.
19:32 Hands down, the best part of this entire video.
i used to think your cool, now your just cringe.
Lifes good he posted again
Everyone: Wow this is very very cool history Me: lol all star reference 7:57
Lemon.
Oversimplified has to do the Nigerian Civil war lol. **where the ussr and usa were on the same side**
LOVE. YOUR. SHIT.
Russia: hey neighbour Us: heey Russia: Alaska Us: money Russia: deal? Us:deal
Bro please give us VIETNAM war oversimplified 😭
Heck no, why would America want Canada, it's cold has too much snow
this stuff keeps getting longer and better
A war over a pig pthhhhh.... We Can see the humanity has gone to shit, and its still going to shit.
Who does the map basicly say Iceland is under british rule
The ending is probably the best ending I’ve ever watched on an oversimplified video.  Biden is coming baby ! Drake the glorious leader XD
What the fuck was that ending XD I love it
Porky the Berkshire pig is my new favorite character. Edit: nvm it died now im sad.
America goes to war with Canada because of an island... And idiocy gallore. Denmark goes to war with Canada over an island. And booze is shared.
OverSimplified upload schedule: Just around enough time for you not to think he is dead.
There is one slight inaccurate part of this. America did not demand the line go straight across the rockies, they wanted it to go up more north. This makes it seem like America got their way in the end, it ended as a compromise, the current border is a compromise.
OH GOD ITS HAPPENING OH GOD OH GOD
the most emotional episode 🤧🤧🤧
A+ videos
Does the ending show you hate Canadians and start a US British war
Damn dude this was the ultimate troll video especially the end. Kuddos bro
I like learning history with this beautiful man.
Take down Canada take them to Canada
OVERSIMPLIFIED IS BACK!!!
HES BACK?!
Yoooooo yes finally i wait for new vids every day
"I am hearing voices all the time" (3:55) as a reason for manifest destiny makes way more sense than I like to admit.
I too heard that it was Sharen's cat.
Love the new video!
its been decades. finally.
I feel that the US would gain more from invading Mexico first instead of Canada.
Love the "I hear voices all the time" at 3:54 .  Also love the search history at 6:30
I’m from Canada and I can officially say I am not scared of Biden
Think about the possibility of a civil war not happening because the nation was in fact united again by a common enemy, the British. And one less head blown off at a theater.
Everyone on my block has a Hamer to attack the Canadians out here in hawaii
LESSSSS GOOOOOOO
Can Canada invade the US instead? I want free healthcare 🥺
WOAH YOU POSTED?!?!?!? YAYYAYAYAYAAYAYYY
Japanese Legends Says If You Can't Sleep At Night It's Because You're Awake.
I forgot that you are oversimplified when you were yelling the Canada part
*Sees Oversimplified notification*  smile
YESSSSSS A NEW VIDEO
So this is how Attack on Titan started
This is such a good representation of America’s terrible conflict attitude
7:58 dayum that reference
He is back👍👍👍👍👍🎊
You know that feel ?when You are alone  ?all the months ? Through the time?  You know ?That how I feel when You do not make some video;( ...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................so thank you for the video
britain its finaly over usa comes get away britain
these videos are too funny and too well made for what they are xD
Wow who knew the vid would come on my b day, thanks for the seriously entertaining work and inspiring vids. But now I'll have to wait a few more months for a new vid- but they are definitely worth it.
Make videos about Irish independence    Please
I miss this channel . Good to know it is still alive!
Astonishing. Maybe some humorous scenes are not the best but I like this video. Also don't worry Canada. USA won't attack you. Probably.
Look whos beck
More please
There is an alternate universe where the assassination of Archduke Porky is the trigger to a world war
I hope one day the history channel or schools pay you to teach us all lol
33:31 I remember my dad used to beat me like that. What a memorable moment
This was 1000% worth the 6 month wait
Lilke a rat or a disease😂🤣
don't worry Canadians, Biden probably forgot that Canada exists
Dreamsmp lore?
That ending was the most beautiful thing OverSimplified has ever created and the world is a happier place for it.
He's Back Baby.
This was amazing see you guys in another 6 months
dude plsssssss i need the swedish invation on russia
I love that Pig in that black hood
Wow, the wait for a new oversimplified video has been worth it! The production quality has increased tenfold!!!! Keep up the great work.
33:20 to 33:26 is the funniest moment.
Man I love Canada. I do sure hope that my dearest American friends don’t invade my beautiful home and native land because of this extremely well produced internet video…
The animation in this is astounding, funny and captivating. Love this so much!
FKING LOVR THE VID HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
That ending was GOLD PURE FUCKING GOLD!
When the pig is sus
HES BACK
We cant go to war because the candians would be too nice and just give us land.
This has to be one of the best!
FRICK YEAH, HES BACK!!
This production is kiss kiss.
Bro you got on trending  Congrats
The funnyman is back
Never forget, Oversimplified flat out LIED about Ho Chi Minh being a brutal dictator in the Cold War video.
I wish oversimplified could do more vids about stuff other than the us. Like half of his videos are about them. Such a boring country.
2:40 I like oversimplified but the war in 1812 is taught as a British victory in both Canada and Britain due to the fact that Britain successfully defended its territories from an USA attack and the USA sued for peace when Britain threatened to send in its actually army. The only reason as to why Britain didn't annex the USA after this war was because Britain was currently tangled up in the Napoleonic Wars. This means that they could not afford to maintain the cost of owning the USA and because annexing the USA would lead to further war with Europe since the main reason for the Napoleonic wars was Frenchs annexing of land which was used as a excuse by the European powers to declare war. This means that Britain couldn't annex the USA since it was far to risky.
NA=US
Vietnam war???
alaska history next! please :)
To think the Pig War was basically a proto-cold war between the United States and United Kingdom is actually very interesting.
If we take over Canada, what should we name it? Amerida, Camerica, Florido? What y’all think?
Evil oversimplified be like: uploads a video every day
I love how this guy slides sponsors into his videos
No way  An upload    Nvm it's not Vietnam    It's still an upload tho
Best video ever
14:10 Just a little thing I noticed throughout American history, the natives tended to side with the British alot (even coincidentally).
Best channel
I've lived in Vancouver, Canada (the cool Vancouver 😁) all my life  and I never heard any of this before. Fantastic video/Great video.
OMG A NEW Video LETS GO
I've waited months for another video... and it was worth it!
38:10 Oh. My. God.
When world needed him the most he returned
OMG the Buchanon impersonation was hilarious HAHA.... I can see him being like that the whole presidency.   Give him props tho, he paid for some slaves and immediately freed them.
It’s truly sad we only get 2 videos a year, but at least they are absolute quality
The ending is the most "OverSimplified Out Of Context" i've ever seen .
I assume Canada is to the US what France is to Germany after this video
this is my density, wow, that's harsh
I'm glad that this video was on something that most people know nothing about. Obviously the videos about the big wars are nice, because they are a great way to refresh one's memory on major historical events. That said, it's nice to learn about a relatively unknown topic
Aand he's back
HELL YEAH NEW OVER SIMPLIFIED VIDEO
The intro was so good
Petition for OverSimplified to do a video that mentions Portugal more.
Pls oh pls, O Wise One do a history of Ireland as a whole. It t’would make me as an Irishman proud 🥲
Babe wake up OverSimplified posted
These little "wars" are great. The Aroostook War / The Great Maine Potato war would be an awesome one too!
14:30 glad to see the way America decides how to tax people hasn't changed at all.
0:50 yeah because white people never fight each other. YOUR PREVIOUS VIDEOS ARE LITERALLY WAR BETWEEN WHITE PEOPLE. EUROPE, USA-BRITAIN . wtf???
me watching this and three dhar mans at the same time.
I was literally just thinking "it's about time for a new OverSimplified video" and not 6 hours later this was posted. Amazing!
Scott: "Harney, don't you DARE put Pickett back on the island." Harney: "Pickett, I'm putting you back on the island." Oversimplified: "This enraged Scott, who punished Harney severely."
Yeah Biden is going to invade Canada…. Cuz he can barely walk up stairs…😂
Ahhhhh, Its been a while hasn't it...
Yessss I’ve been waiting I binged all your vids a couple months ago
Me has a Quebecer seeing the end of this video : Here's the Anglo-saxon invasion... again!
I was watching this on my lunch break and thought "man pickett sounds really familiar and i cant remember why" and then later on you said he was a virginian that lead the picketts charge and i immediately thought "oh yeah i live in Virginia thats why it sounds familiar"
Animal wars
who else thought this was technoblade
BUT WHY DID YOU DRAW THE PIG SO CUTE OH NOOO-
Vancouver native here, very entertaining
31:03
Nice thumbnail
Wow just wow
The day you stop making videos is the day I stop learning about history
Never stop making these!!!
The Houses of Parliament scene was all right until the shut up and names
27:27 wait, I don't see a difference.
What tf happened with this patriotism at the end
HOW DID THEY GET MORGAN FREEMAN TO DO A VOICEOVER FOR A PIG I NEED TO KNOW
The day oversimplified runs out of stories is when the universe ends
Love your videos. Would you ever have an interest in covering non War American topics like the Dust Bowl? I have found that too few of our fellow Americans are familiar with it let alone the scope. Thanks!
Can you please do a video about Finland
Please make a video about the vietnam war
Missed opportunity to set up a sequel about the Alabama Affair and the Alaska Purchase, which is all almost as insane and includes this amazing quote from the British Prime Minister when Russia tried to sell Alaska to them: "Canada is enough frozen wasteland to contend with; we do not need any more."
Over simplified Star Wars
You guys should definetly do the 80 years war sometime, it would make a great oversimplified video
Religion always had horrible justification for doing terrible atrocities
BRO I TOLLD  ONE YOUTUBER  AND HE ONLY  REATIDE  IT ONLY HALK
King is BACK!!!!
Me as a canadian in the ending: you attempt to invade us, we’ll burn down Washington again.
Alternative title , Peoples stubborn pride prevents them from making smart decisions
I spit my drink at the buffalo slaughter.. omg that was great!!
Tax guy: U want oversimplified to make more videos??  The people: YES Tax guy: oof theres a tax for that
The best time of the year when i get to see a new oversimplified video :)
The president hiding behind the curtain made me lose it
As a canadian... your uppity a*s probably shouldn't forget we burnt your pink house down once. We can do it again, and apologize after. Our pilar bears and moose will help us. And don't make us get the Canadian Geese involved. We would all regret that.
Hilarious
I screamed at the end of that video. American RMPs is the most terrifying thing I have ever heard.
Can you please make a video for the Greek revolution 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
When the world needed him most...     the legend returned!!!
He must be very patriotic about USA invading Canada
So it was a bad ending
Biden's coming cracked me up so hard💀💀💀
I love u
This has to be one of the most American YouTube history channels I've had the pleasure of listening to! We are coming Canada...
me telling my parents its ok to watch this: 12:54
Nice one as always
For real though what about Canada! a whole video and all u talk about is british this and Brittsh that...pffff shameful!! (oozing sarcasm)
I think oversimplified has these other mushrooms in his salad
This xmas present is fucking dope.
beautiful finale 10/10 would watch agen
Next month: The Alaska occupation or the Mexican-American war?
I wish I could like this video more than once
As a Brit, I'd just like to say.  *COUGH* TheIslandsAreStillOurs *COUGH*
i love how you completely broke your character at the end of your video hahahahaha
As a Canadian, I agree that America is a better country
I’m not even going to lie, the speech at the end as a joke honestly his voice gave me chills. I have never heard his voice like that
I feel like this video wont age well
He isssssss bacccck!
This was great! Would like to see a Korean  war and Vietnam war oversimplified videos.
Ya hit trending brother <3
epic finale, it's epic  ajjajja xD  ps: yeah... that's what united state sounds to the rest of the world =D
So the US is gonna invade Canada for 20 years, spend 20 trillion dollars... Then end the war, go home and 1 month later everything is just like it were before the invasion :p
I'd like too see yall try and invade your last few occupations haven't gone so well eh
34:13 sick moves
So...can this be considered a declaration of war?
Babe, stop what you’re doing Oversimplified posted!
7:56 *but the americans keep coming and dont stop coming* *hopped in their wagon and they hit the ground running*  hey now
*#3 on trending*
I've been waiting for this video!
This is definitely the best one yet
countries in the 1800’s invading other countries and starting wars that would kill thousands for no fucking reason and then being called “the good guys” hundreds of years later: 😎
7:57 love that  12:41 and that  17:45 and that  29:10 aAGgGaHHh  32:30 you guys are fine
Man, Im American and I think America was in the wrong
the King is Back
as an indian I feel offended wby the fact that the man at the start of the video said " Woah woah woah, I didn't say that they were WHITE people
this one was one of the best on so far and RIP the pig btw canada i going to take the usa :)
If only these were made once a month. Kick ass 40 minutes
Technoblade

I love the Smash Mouth reference!
finnally!!
Still waiting for that Vietnam video
When you don't get a notification for the new video,but a recommendation.
And that's how a youtube video started world war 3

I’m so glad that OverSimplified Uploaded!! I needed this Video!!
Make a video about polish soviet war

oversimplified: make a video about vietnam or the middle east "no". make a video about a war that didnt happen
You gotta admit, his sponsor advertising is beautiful
wow nice
A sincere welcome to all people who live in Canada 🇺🇸
Pig
Next video can you make a oversimplified Texas Revolution, or The US-mexican war?
When he uploads, it's like a blessing.
Lyman likes potato’s more than the Irish
Dude……….. Very Cool🤣🙂. Loved it
Ngl but I kinda wish u did 1812 or Maybe 100 years war
I will trespass into your sheep run *his crops get eaten* YoU aRe TrEsPaSsInG
The animation has gotten noticably better and the humor has gotten more hilarious! Excited for the next upload, It's gonna be worth the wait
7:58 Bars 😤
18:35 so because he ate the eating of the potato's is the cause of the killing of the pig, you could say it's a POTATO WAR. OMG it was technoblade al along!!!!
President Drake. Yes.
let's be honest  oversimplified teaches better than school history teachers
The ending was legend wait for it dary
Uh oh
Father has blessed us
the plushie is adorable
When General Harney calls the person who lead Pickett's charge.
Talk about Nigeria's Biafra war
Where is Hitler Pt2 banned? Last I checked it was available even here in Germany.
Wow, I've never heard of this before.
omg new vid
Can you do the Spanish American war and the phase of when America went on full on Imperialism like when it acquired Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines from Spain?. Maybe cover the conquest of those territories, more specifically, the conquest of the Philippine islands?, It was a war that most Americans today don't even know about, it included Americans committing atrocities against Filipino natives like genocide and concentration camps. And an estimated 200,000 to 1,000,000 Filipinos were killed in the war
Straight line?
Why do you wake up only once in six months with a video? Shouldn't the videos be bit more regular?
Those legs on the pig are the most cursed thing in the entire oversimplified universe
Love the Star Wars poster for the thumbnail
The out of context moments are crazy in this video
HE HAS RETURNED!
I appreciate the to do list, that Lincoln wrote 34:40
i've waited 6 months for a pig war?????
FINALY ANOTHER VIDEO
Who’s waiting for 2020 Oversimplified?
Yo you're back
It wasn’t a draw…uk won
Next yugoslavia war 1992-99
Yay new video
You should really do videos about Mexican Wars…
I hope he will do the occupation of west and east Germany and the Chinese civil war
29:12 best scene🤣
LETS GO!
Middle east next?
7:58 lmao. All stars reference. Well done
Uh, Oversimplified, I think you forget about the United Nations, taking action of the USA invading Canada.
Jesus christ the ending though, It's Beautiful.
AW CMON I WAITED 6 MONTHS FOR A PUNY WAR VIDEO I THOUGHT U WERE GONNA DO 7 YEARS WAR OR ANY OTHER BIG WAR AND WE GOT THIS?!?!?
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH GOD DAMN
Yay another video, I’ve been waiting for awhile and now I’m happy :D
We need more of these videos In our lives 😂😂
You know, this is why you shouldn’t have romantic relations with animals. If griffin didn’t love the pig that Dang much, maybe this stuff wouldn’t happen.
hes bavkkccai jbshwa
Anyone notice the dress on Porky is Cinderella's and the dress on Spuddy is Belle's.
Can you please do the Scottish wars of independence next?
YES YES HE UPLOADED
finally a new video thanks
And now we wait month again for another quality video
Actually a little wholesome.
4:18 i am dying hahahahah love this
FINALY
yessssssir
FINNALY  A great video. And pig
Ya know, this video is really awesome, but I think the absurdity should be toned down a bit. The whole pig and potato lover thing was a bit too much, to be honest. Don't get me wrong, I love OverSimplified. The Napoleon Wars, WW1 and WW2 videos are some of the best videos on YouTube, but it honestly seems that he's trying a bit too hard in this video. If I were him, I think i'd take a couples courses on video pacing and comedy, because most of this stuff didn't really land for me. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Just some fair criticism from a loving fan! <3
2 year plain so it will run out when the next vid is out??
YOU‘RE BACK!
"It is my density"
Thumbnail mwah beautiful perfect 👌
33:30  This enraged Scott, who punished Harney severely.
Canadians at the end: *Nervous sweating*
Legend
Wth when did he become so patriotic like i know that america won the cold w but it isnt that mighty??
Voice acting improved since first video
Love your videos mate!
¿Could you do a video about mexico next?
I think America should most definitely annex Canada, for their own good.
NEW VID
That has the be the most dumbest piece I now know. I love it
As a Canadian who literally only sees Canada’s many military victories (over)simplified as Vimy Ridge I really appreciate this video.
That is pretty well done, sir! And loved the ending, lol
You know... he does have a point. Why NOT invade Canada?
HAHAHAH OMG I DIDNT SAY THERE ARE W PEOPLE HAHA
Best example of quality over quantity
I am so moved by the speech I want to invade Canada.... And I am Indian 😁😁😁😁😁😁  Love this episode
He’s back…. not for long
"Oh, I see" "So that's how it is, huh?" "That's how it's going to be, is it?" "That's the way in which things are, eh?" "That be how it will, is it?" "Will it be how that is, huh?" "That be the way in which things be the way they are, is it?"  Sherrif Barnes,1850 sumthing
YYYYEES OS I LOVE YOU CONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pls maybe for Futher vids talk about Alexander the great/Ceaser/Augustus/Migheal the ruther/
God bless America
2:56 Me and my brother when we must share. But is offen looks like this 5:14
12:04 sorry to say, but its pronounced Barkshire. I know, I hate it too
FINNALY NEW VIDEO AJJA
What a patriot!
Oh god. His humor and animation is evolving.
Ah man doesnt that pig Look Like the one from Gravity Falls? Looks similiar
I was thinking yesterday - it's been 6 months since the Napoleon episode, wouldn't now be the right time for another Oversimplified vid ? _And look what I found here_
Just hit my head and having a massive open cut can’t do shit but new oversimplified video
OH YEAH NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO
At this point I've learned more history from oversimplified then I have actual school.
Jizzingham and Fartingdom could easily be legit places in the UK.
Unbelievable how early i came..
Finally!!
I think some of that Harney bled into him for that last part
wohooo another video from my favourite channel :DDD
I can say you put a lot of work in the thumbnail and video
I hope next video is not about a meme war, I'm not much into them
7:58 I know what you did there
Hey, oversimplified I really like your channel, and I think you should make a video about the great Australians on the emu war. (PLZ DO IT)
Why can’t I see hitler oversimplified???
War was going to happen but then they decided to solve it using Germany. Dude, uncool.
apart from the fact that the whole world hates the usa and would obliterate them if they try to invade the nicest country in the world.... yes. they could invade canada
he really changed a lot
That’s the way it will be eh? I laughed and died
as a brazilian, i could speak that this seems  with the toninha war KKKKKKKKK
These videos are improving every 6 months!    You turned a small land dispute into a 38 minute video stretching from the end of the revolutionary war to just after the civil war.  And it’s funny af
I love ❤
you're back ❤❤
And Britain is going to burn down the Whitehouse again if you touch Canada
ayy 17 hours up, 227k likes, you son of a bitch :3
Next Vietnam war please
This just made my day so much better
:))))
This war changed the world history forever.
And when we needed him the most, he came back.  It’s been so long!
A major war was almost started by a pig A Serbian sandwich: "could this pig be, one of my people"
Refugees and immigrants in a nutshell 3:40
THE KING IS BACK
It pronounced barkshire
As a not Canadian, OverSimplified is the greatest thing to ever come out of an American.
This is the best one
BAAAAAAA!
Brits and their ability to define borders. Match made in heaven....
You saw the end of the video Canadians, THE DAY OF THE RAKE IS COMING!
Soooo love with this videosss!!
No one's talking about Smash Mouth reference? Nobody? Okay...

Привет от русских любителей творчества Oversimplifield!

Look who back, back again

The animations look better. Verry nice
Ah but you Americans won’t be able to get past our polar bear mounted fighters armed with syrup guns
Straight line?
You know the reason God hasn't come back? Its cuzwe're not done manifest destinying
BOI
When you live on Vancouver island and are so happy that somebody is referencing it.
English Civil war might be cool
Lmao that ending
bruh what was that ending, there was no need for that it made a video very cringey
OMG his voice is so much lower
Thanks
:v
Vietnam war next pls.
Finally new fideo
YAY!!! A NEW ONE!! I have kk idea what this is but I’m gunna watch it just cause it OverSimplified
37:27 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 I've had nightmares like this
Its allways worth my time watching  ur videos u allways  make me laugh
I love this channel.
We didn’t ask for it but we needed it
Let go new video
I love how you randomly throw in you Nord VPN ads. Even your own characters are confused by them.
Jesus, what in the hell was that ending?!
7:57 LOL🤣🤣🤣🤣👌
I'm sorry, was that Morgan Freeman ?
I just want Drew Durnil react to this. Hey Drew, if you see my comment, please do it
THE KING HE FINALLY UPLOADED

Please do seven years war next
37:18 *Sweats in Canadian* 0_0
after so long
36:57 When you run out of history so you make your own
Thank lord.. finally OverSimplified uploaded another video.. else I would have flooded your instagram inbox with new video request!
Great video
no3 trending
I loved the ending had. Me laughing so hard I'm crying
Oversimplified, probably won't see this but I know many other viewers and I all want a video on the Vietnam war, and you hinted at it being made back in the cold war series. I was just wondering if you are working on it or planning to work on it, or if you aren't going to do it at all?
Hey, I dunno if you ever considered it, but this wars over stupid reasons always remind me of the Cake War over in Mexico! One of my favorite stupid reasons to go to war.
OMG new video
wooo yay a new vid
So funny but so stupid
I am so happy i cannot put it in words.
For a sec I thought this was a more hilarious version of the Emu War in Australia-
16:01 A true American would use an M16 rather then an AK-47 this man is a Russian spy
Me: *Sweats in Canadian*
Finally a new video after six months
I love the days when a new oversimplified video comes out. History and humour combined.  Hopefully he'll make a video about german unification one day...
All i Can hear Now ia  Video a few Year From Now Being Like: and Many Historians See this as the offical Decloration of War... *Rapidly Oversimplified War Squence*
Can we have Vietnam ?
Cya again in 6 months
The fact at the part where Lyman shot the pig, the actor for the pig actually sounded like Morgon Freeman
Biden can't invade Canada. He's too busy being harassed by half his own people.
This reminds me of mini wars
i wantt more oversimplifiedd pleasee upload more
I come after 6 month
There's so many topics like german unification, italian unification, roman empire, rise of caliphate and Indian empire..so why no videos on these topics?
How I love the nineteenth century 19
Yowwwww
A video about the partition of Poland-Lithuania would be great!
The more time we wait the better it gets
You mock, but the US got the islands in the end, so who's laughing? Why WOULD we compromise when every time we refused the "fair compromise that protects both our interests" we end up getting what we want?
that ending was too funny
mol
Seriously, best video yet!!
The end is like: *'MURICA FUCK YEEEEAH*
37:14 - the best ending to an oversimplified video I could ever want lol
Straight line?
Another fine release by Oversimplified!
poggers he uploaded
This video reminds me of the hans island war
I live in the San Juan Islands and had know idea about this
Georgia now?
12:23 Do my ears sense the kerbal space program theme? :D
So on our next test. Is Drake going to be president or not. I didn't want to get it wrong. Anxious reply. Bitting my nails is a bad habit. Right.?
I love all the running gags in these videos. Those, my friends, are for the OG fans.  I hope this channel continues for as long as the host wants it!
Did we really need that island tho. Like we got Alaska a few years in there.
17:53 He really said that 🤣
Yatta!
Best outro ever
7:57 That Allstar thing was smooth
Well it was such a nice pig.
LOL - WTF with Canada??!?!?
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO YAY
Us-eh 🤣🤣
An American killed the pig this enraged the British who tried to punish him severely
That awkward moment when the most inspiring and moving political speech 21st century USA has to offer is a shitpost advocating for the conquest of Canada.
yoo another oversimpified
"He was obviously told to go suck an egg" xD
This was fantastic!
America fucking Yeah ! 😂😂😂😂😂
When the world needed him most he came back :D
Baby wake up, Oversimplified just posted!
This sounds exactly like the Hatfields and McCoy's just on a national scale, speaking of, that would probably make a good video
am I the only one who watches this in a weird aspect ratio
What's sad is Biden is so dumb he would actually believe the ending of this video. Haha
idk may be we would be in a better place if we did join them. Why are we still Sovereign to a country Nobody here gives a fuck about in 2021, respectfully ? great video though
YES THEY FINALLY POSTED
back at it again
Oh my god u uploaded an actual video!!!
I non-ironically believe that the US should annex Canada.
"Multiply and spread across the country like rats, or a disease"?   Lovely analogy.  It doesn't take a crystal ball to know what you're going to say next.   "Justifying colonialistic tendencies"?   Evidence, please?  Mocking the beliefs of the people who founded the country?  Hm.  I guess you aren't worried about turning off your audience, many of whom are descended from the filthy colonizers.  "Oversimplified" is a great name for your channel....Hopelessly One-Sided would be another.  Viewers be warned.
All sleepy Joe can do is shit and sleep in the white house  How can you invade Canada if all you do is shit in the toilet all day long 🤣
Ending made the video tbh lol
Yesss he posted
Let’s fucking go a new vid
I mean ww1 started because of a sandwich so a pig isn't that bad
Now you gotta make a Mexican-American war vid 👍🏽
This video is extra based on the anti imperialist angle. Nice
7:57  *inhales deeply*  “SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME”
I like how he finishes talking about a conflict between two countries that almost escalated into war for basically no reason, and then immediately suggests we start a war with Canada for basically no reason.
Canada is a north american Denmark
This guys country pride is unparalleled
That gun-toting yeehaw gets me every time 😂😂😂 36:01
3:37 omg a Back To The Future reference!
Anyone else disappointed at how "liberal" oversimplified has become. 🤮😭 I wish politics could stop poisoning everyone I love.
AHH
I would have liked to imagien the germans would have said that they now own the islands so that they stop bothering XD
Loved it, thanks. see y'all next year
Smashed it. That ending 🤣
Didn't even mention Canada enough. SMH
37:13, Careful, you might make @J.J. McCullough Amerisimp bussy all wet.
I’m not saying this for attention. Just speaking from the heart. I was having a young week, and this video was very educational and helped me feel a lot better. Thanks!
👎 This video is about the conflict that never was. It was more of a suspicious attempt to ridicule and demonize Americans. At the beginning of the video it's stated that Americans wanted to expand because they are racists. Well, the Spanish were white, the French were white, the British were white and Americans kicked them all out. If you think this land belongs to Indians, then do the ultimate virtue signaling stunt and give ALL your properties to an Indian, then move to Cuba. Problem solved!
I liked this video before I even watched it, I have NO REGRETS!  Awesome stuff!
Finaly a New video
This video took a turn at the end. As a Canadian I feel like I need to write a strongly worded email to someone.
Biden is a geriatric sock puppet. He doesn't have the spine or the mental fortitude to go after anyone.
I gotta apologies to you I thought I have been subbed since 300k turns out I was never subbed I would like to apologies
Emu war? Pig war? What next? *meme war?*  12:53 Are you crazy?  12:54 *IM PERFECTLY STABLE YOU RATBAG CALL ME CRAZY AGAIN THEN ILL EAT UR EYES!!!!!!!!*  14:31 for all this farm stuff you got here  *GO SUCK AN EGG 🥚*  15:55 Well.that would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interest of both parties., *AND THERES NO WAY IM EVER GONNA AGREE TO IT!*  *(le epic guns)*  16:22 We can't risk those glubby Americans hearing about this!   *(freedom music (tell me the name))*  *0H N0!!!*  17:49 It is up to you, to keep your potatoes, *OUTTA MAH PIG!*  31:03 *lyman, if you spare my life, i grant u 3 wishes-*  *boom*  31:52 STAY BACK! I-ILL SHOOT!  *GO AHEAD PUNK! MAKE MY DAY, SHOOT ME! SHOOT MEEÈEEEEËƏEEEE!!!!!!!*  26:03 *(anime face)* *OH CRAP JEFF WERE ABOUT TO GET BLOWN TO BITS! RUN!!!!!!!!!*
this video is Us propoganda
Yayyy!!
33:29 LMAAAOOOOOOOO
35:30 Don't think people are gonna notice that word, but I did.
that...end
Sorry but Canadians aren't afraid of Biden.
19:11
After watching this channel for a few years.. I am starting to understand what kind of weird shit is happening
“ well that  be a completely fair compromise that protects the interest of both parties AND THERES NO WAY IM EVER GONNA AGREE TO IT” start of Nearly every American conflict ever
Canada had pigs of mass destruction.
Make a video on Indian independence struggle.
Amazing Video 👌
Hoo getting spicy with these jokes eh oversimplified?
That ending. Are you OK bud? Good video, always look forward to your content.
Finally dude another video
Make a video about Japanese Empire
Just as I was wondering which one of your videos to rewatch with my dinner...
Bro, thank u......
Aye let's go
Oh Canada. Or as I like to call them Minnesconsin north. (Minnesota and Wisconsin). I think the USA should annex the Minnesconsin north and probably everything that is still part of United Kingdom up to and including England herself. It’ll be fun, just me.
new video yay
21,500TH COMMENT
Been waiting on this for months. Lets go!!!
Do one on the British civil war.

Trigger warning:  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
This this Is soothing lol
I think that maybe, just maybe, Oversimplified was getting a liiiiiittle but irked by the Canada comments in his videos 😂
A history lesson that isn't boring and makes you laugh? oversimplified is the way to go.
As a Canadian, I finally subscribed to oversimplified after seeing the end of this video 😂
The pork wars be like??
You should do a video on the protestant reformation
The God Has Returned
Oversimplified really lost his mind in the outro.
from 16:33 to 16:36 is truly american
Vietnam War for next video plz
My family and I are huge oversimplified fans! My kids have become genuinely interested in history in large part because of your videos. Thank you really! You’ve managed a great thing with this channel. I have only one request of you, please don’t give way to becoming overly cynical about history. I know the channel is called oversimplified. But you’ve always done an amazing job at keeping nuance and balance in your story telling. Which is such a rare feat. I can imagine how difficult it must be to try and not allow the attitudes and political divides of our day to slant your retellings. Anyhow just wanted to share my appreciation for your work as well my two cents. My family and I will as always be looking forward to your next video with the usual excited anticipation.
Literally no one: 12:05 Me: Waddles?
Biden taking Canida not a chance. All Canida would have to do is go up the stairs and Biden would never reach it.  Let's go Brandon!
7:15 sussy
I love you, Oversimplified!
The level of details and production in this video is amazing.
Amazing
The fact that he got Charlie Hopkins to be in this video makes me love this channel even more.
Good but a bit biased
Finally 😁
that was pretty funny, i can’t lie.  Have the Americans ever actually gotten revenge for 181- oh. Decolonisation
great! A video about how america is blueballing a war...... again.....
7:57 what a reference🤣🤣
the ending is one of the funniest things I've seen in my LIFE
"Lord Jizzingham" LMAO
I was not expecting Smash Mouth on the Oregon Trail.
Finnaly
That ending was… rowdy 😂
Interesting ending
And it all would never have happened if they just had a straight line
p
you should do 80-year war. with the dutch and spanish and stuff
Lol
*ONE OF THE VERY BEST* video's on YouTube - utterly brilliant...
That ending was the best thing I have ever seen.
1:00 Who was in paris?
37:18 This is BY FAR, the single greatest ending I've ever seen in an Oversimplified video. What a motivation.
Lol
noway his back!!!!
omg oversimplified uploaded
Ah yes this be epic
When we needed you the most.. you came back.
Should do the history of the jacobites
That ending had me yelling "USA USA USA!"
The best youtuber
suddenly, I'm craving some bacon
The part with Joe Biden will be attached to my brain for a lot of time
even. oversimplified is using the floating figures movie poster trend on his thumbnail
I was expeting the italo-german unification, but this was cool too
When longtime age unemployment men boiling carbitch cofe this morning, same time her talk not mother language
The ending was just 👌
Plz no
#1 on trending!
37:13
6 month drought. Worth it.
8:48
HE'S BACK!
As a Canadian. That ending was breathtakingly horrifying and I loved it
Where Canada
"Hello. My name is Charles Griffin. You killed my pig. Prepare to die!"
I love the last part lol
Finaly I’ve been waiting for this for over half a year
Wait, isn't the telegraph in existence during this time? Why didn't he use it? That's much faster
Kinda wrecked the video with that Biden part at the end. Biden is coming? Biden doesn't know what planet he is on.
7:32
Blessed again
Could u do a vid about the gulf war and the Vietnam war pls...
16:32 damn i hadnt even noticed all the mobility scooters jet lmfao

Best Historian ever

Oversimplified after the video: "Knock" FBI open up!!
Bruh! Talk about 1857 war of Indian independence!
That thumbnail is amazing
For a channel called Oversimplified, you sure seem to complicate things.. and I love you for it.
Bro who cares about america come back to Europe :(

Oh Canada so voluptuous lmao
7:10 violation

This video until 37:13 : Wow! Good, informative video about an event I had no clue about.   Then from 37:14 : WTF O.O
Yaaaaaay my favorite youtuber just uploaded!
If you’re actually interested in doing a video on Canadian history, a video on Louis Riel and the Métis Rebellions could be a good start.
In 50 years, there will be no Canada, just America Part 2.
At 7:57 I love the all star reference
Bravo bravo bravo.  This might be your finest work yet.
Not me being Canadian and not knowing any of this
As a wise man once said “you might have Outsmart me but I have never seen someone outsmart a bullet
10:26 As an "Bri'ish people" I can confirm this to be an accurate summary of our Great nation...          You clicked "Read more", *there's a tax for that.*
7:08 As an "Bri'ish people" I can confirm this to be an accurate summary of our Great nation...          You clicked "Read more", *there's a tax for that.*
now the Hey Arnold pig war episode makes more sense to me
Hey now, you’re American time to go out and slay! Hey now it’s time to come and go and get land! All that land and buffalo sorry but you got dysantery...
After 5 monts He is bacc
Why does the nordVPN stick figure look like its got the worst hairline

The king returns!
I thought this guy died
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."    -John 3:16 God gave us his only  son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Savior, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all
I'm from Hungary. Oversimplified I support you. (The SteamyMc Steamface meme is good).
I ended up late for this cause my parents qouldn't shut up-
"There's only one problem with Canada... it's full of Canadians" - Dudley Doright.
Dude this guy for this one just said:  “So how many guns should we put-“  Oversimplified: Y E S  “What-“  Oversimplified: I SAID *Y E S*
The Royal navy once again saving the day
I love the rant at the end. Making fun of manifest destiny and American patriotism is always fun
There is a chance that this video will become in the near future, as a historical reference for a certain war between North America countries....
Yesss, missed this channel videos
Poor pig
AMERICA F*CK YEAH!
Woah ur still on YouTube
que carajo amigo
Can next video be the Scottish Wars of Independence next
Am I the only one who thinks this guy's content is unimpressive?
Finally another video 😃
Can you make a video on the Balkan Wars?
you underestimate our moose power…
Nice one OverSimplified 14:29 IT reads BOOBIES backward on the calculator 😂😂😂😂😂
...
Vietnam?
This video was totally worth the wait. The ending absolutely had me rolling. 😂
Great vid, now to try to sleep 6 months so that another one comes out
After a long time. we missed you so much Oversimplified.
Please do the English Civil War next!
27:34 no war
I am glad you are back....
As a Canadian, is it bad that the only time I have ever heard of the Pig War is because of Hey Arnold?
Yaassssss I love when he posts
6months :(
31:58 Some real Rosenbaum vibes there lmao
This is just America being assholes for 38 minutes and 43 seconds.
Tremendo el final xd
Yeehaw, I was browsing your videos the other day cause I knew it was time for a new one. yippee!!!!
When he posts :
That ending 🤣 like wth
The king posts again
Am I the only one who wants to see more videos about the 20th Century such as the Arab-Israeli Conflict or the Vietnam War or the InterWar Period and League of Nations or the Bosnian War
It’s my density - America on expansion
I love Over simpli fied
1.8 million views in 16 hours, am so fucking happy
A-why was I not notified  B- I NEED TO WATCH
OverSimplified and Kurzgesagt uploaded in the same day!!!  OverSimplified and Kurzgesagt uploaded in the same day!!!
NEW VID YOOOOO
Oversimplified uploaded!!!
Dang it oversimplified. If you had only uploaded like a month ago I could have convinced my history teacher to show this video to the class.
Could you do a video about the Swedish empire. AND IF YOU DON’T. IT IS okay.
I’ve never laughed more times while learning American history in my entire life, this is just great!
The war of 1812 was not a draw lmao, the British and CANADA won very clearly.
What
Imagine starting a war over a video
Best way to revise the lesson
It feels like oversimplified is becoming funnier and funnier each video
"I didn't say they were white people" SUBSCRIBE
My dog is trending hell yeah
Actually the War of 1812 was a defeat for the US as they failed to achieve any of their stated War goals. Status Quo ante Bellum essentially meant that Britain had won.
Best youtuber ever
Finaly the best joke in YouTubeber in history animated
Finally.
Yay oversimplified again  Lol i wrote this almost 8 months ago i sounded so stupid but why hasn’t oversimplified posted is he okay or is he planing something big 😐 🤔
12:53 JESUS, CHILL BRO!!!!  Edit: the ratbag line is what inspired my name.
Not sure if it was intentional or not but I love how it says "density" instead of "destiny" @3:37
The only manifest destiny I can get behind is conquering Canada!
The return of the king
Viewers: where Canada Oversimplified: here's Canada and I am about to blow it to pieces
Hurr durr America bad.
lets goooooooooo i have been wating for this for months
The fact that the pig is Waddles from Gravity Falls is the icing on the Cake
We all know why the germans chose American annexation instead of british
17:00 that tiny piece of American territory at the top is bigger than the Caribbean island I live on
''Oversimplified - The Pig War''     I did not see this coming.
Ohoho this is gonna be a good one Edit: I was not disappointed
16:36
General Harney looks like he is always suspicious of anybody and anything.
In a huge upset, Canadians deployed its deadliest weapon - the beavers.  The Beavers chewed through all vital communication channels and crippled the US infrastructure leading to their defeat.  And that was the oversimplified war of 2022.
as of when i'm commenting this video is #3 ON TRENDING
plot twist: oversimplified made this video to silence angry fans for not uploading xd
Keep up the good work
That was quite possibly the best ending to a video I have ever seen. And honestly why doesn’t our great American republic span across north AMERICA
Its actually weird to see an OverSimplified video which i havent seen yet
Oversimplified just becomes funnier exponentially
That's not how VPNs work..... I fucking hate NordVPN advertisements.
Pls make balken wars or the Bulgarian east Roman Empire wars
Great video! Can you please do the next one about the Thirty Years’ War?
OH MY GOD HE POSTED
why is this plusi so expencive 25 dollars equal 4000 rupees in my country
Legendary
yes new video
technoblade
the goat
This video make me laugh so hard 🤣🤣🤣. Kudos to the sense of the humor of oversimplified. This is the best ending of a oversimplified video I ever seen 🤣🤣🤣
l loved the ending dude
That ending had me bawling with both laughter and patriotism😂
And also where do you get the plushie?
Best YouTube channel ever made, hands down
Oversimplified going wild for invasion at the end was insane
Didn't like till the Canada part at the end, let's go lads we're invading Canada!
Wait wait wait… What is Patreon?
Does this mean the issue was only settled 6 years after the Civil War ended? Because the german empire only started to exist in 1871.
Hey over simplified you could do a video on the English civil war I'm 1640 something 😁
Great video as always!
AMAZING! THANKS
Finnaly next oversipflied videon
Lol...
Finally a new video!!!!!!!!
this seems to be overtly pro british
do the 7 years war
as a Canadian I welcome an American takeover. Our PM is Castros son and we are becoming a fascist dictatorship like australia. Please come bring us state rights.
3:53 one guys in the crowd says i hear his voices all the time, lol
Well, the French *did* go to war with Mexico over pastries…
What the history channel would take 5 episodes to explain,oversimplified does in 35 minutes
American expansion compared to R Rats and Viruses?!  *Chef's kiss* 😙🤌🏻
That ending was absolutely perfect
37:39 सपने देखना बन्द करो
The legend has returned
FINALLY
Did the US just declare war on Canada?
3:37 “It’s my density!!”
Uncle Joe came in me :stuff:
Technoblade be like
plz do a video on vietnam war
31:00 pig sound like father from fallout 4
What would have happen if douglas orders were followed then war happened because of that small land and the pig 😅😅😅
37:20 when you let your 3am thoughts on too much
Ahhh funny
we’ll that was very entertaining good jobs guy and LET TAKE OVER CANADAAAA
My fellow certified lover boys ,
I've never seen these numbers on an education video... 1.8m in under a day... Only OverSimp
As someone who lives in Clark County Washington, especially nearby Fort Vancouver and the Columbia river, this is so surreal and kind of terrifying
That ending. Wow, that ending. That may have topped the entire video
God save America baby!
SPUDDY
YES, let gooooooo u came back
finally *the pig*
hi
3:52 i thought it was sharon's cat had me LMAO
NOOOOO
First i thought no way it would take this long to make a video but now i understand why it took so long great video Oversimplified!
This is literally your greatest creation.
0:36 love the Russian flag in the background
All i want for chrismas is a oversimplefied video
Jesus Christ, mate, maybe don't start a civil war in NATO? That would be quite a bummer
Best. Ending. Ever
Ending was so good, so American, so perfect that I actually laughed myself into tears
Im convinced the reason thses talke so long is because oversimplified has to come up with new segments into the sponsor OF NORD VPN THE BEST VPN THAT WILL COVER ALL OF YOUR DATA :P
General Harney... now thats issssss weird
I don't know why but I was expecting technoblade !
Man it has been to long
Just wow.
The fact that they needed the german Empire to decide is totally... wow! I love the ending!
the last part sounded like trump
you upload slow but great content
Please make more videos please
this is the best Edited video of all oversimplified  ones
Wait, why did Britain go to war over the falklands then?
The border should be on the far right channel those islands belong to the British in fact the whole world is British world je Britain yes I wonder how many Americans I angered
Can we please have titanic oversimplified? Great video man
Finally new video 😁
21,383rd
Beautiful
It was a hell of a time watching this high. When I saw the notification I thought I was just seeing shit lmao.
woooo new oversimplified video!!!
Honestly knowing how tyrannical the Canadian Government is it’s probably best if we did take over Canada.
I’m making pancakes who wants some
As a Canadian  Oh crap
And he’s back
The…Germans… Why?
i dont know how i feel about this
5:51 💀☠💀
2:50 You are definitely average height for the time
his meme status is climbing the ladder
37:22 But Canada has support of the British. And then you would have to pay reparations.
Man I love your videos bro it's hilarious and Contentful bro can you do Indian war of independence
The ending killed me 😂😂
Love vids
I mean the natives are living much better now 💀
33:29 When your dad punishes you severely
Do break of yogoslavia and balkan war
that pig looks like a black version of waddles from gravity falls, which also takes place in oregon i'm cackling up OMG
this video is longer than the two videos on WW2 combined
Congratulations on going to trends i guess
I learned about this in school lol.
HE UPLOADED
Amazing job as alway and hilarious. But who else besides me had 'Hey Arnold' flashbacks?
.
Holy shit I remember doing a presentation on this in like 6th grade
"But the americans keep coming and they dont stop coming hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running."  -Oversimplified
One way to know Oversimplified uses NordVPN? Look at the head everytime he shows the sponsor. It's the Nord logo
*4:12** THE GUY WITH THE FLOATING McDonalds*  honestly I am in tears laughing...
WOOH
Can you do a video on the Vietnam War
solid video, as always!
When this video came out, it was 1AM for me. By the time I got to the end, I thought I was actually having a fever dream
good video see y’all in a year
17:33 Why is the pig reminds me of Waddles from Gravity Falls?
Day 1 telling OverSimplified that his videos are good.
Why doesn't American invade Canada?: Deaf America will look more like Nazi Joe Biden is a sweet old man People going against the war Russia is a enemy (maybe) What's the point? Americans want Canada juice
A little sad you didn't post for a while but this made it well worth it
So this is a combination of the falkland war and the emu war leveled up, great 👌😂. Btw the animation and content of the video is getting greater. Great job and keep up the good content.
“Straight line? Straight line.” 💀
The waddles pig on the thumbnail is amazing love your work
That smashmouth reference
Oversimplified is now explaining wars that not many people know, like this one, teaching others it's existence I guess...
america would regret it we have so many allies that u would be buried in insane ammounts of troops including our special armed forces.
Make partitions of Poland
I was just screamingnto my friends about being sad cause i cant hug anyone and i press the video 😈😈
Hello oversimplified,i love your videos,you made me learn history and enjoy it while doing so,i gained interest in these topics and as a turkish person,i would really like it if you made a video about “Turkish independence war” its a interesting and fun topic,but sadly controversial.Thank you for listening
I'd worry less about Canada's curves and more about yours. WHAT A RRRRRRROAST
He is back…..
HE’S BACK
Oversimplified! Being a better history teacher, than public and private education, every where!
Xmas came early I suppose
Um... 38:00
Hudsans bay still massive today
Talk about the butterfly effect
YESS!!!
I think they should have made it an independent city.
He is hilarious...his timing ,humour ,and joke are best.. One  of the best channel of youtube... Love from india.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
3:42 Excellent bombing
5:56 What the F 🤣🤣🤣 The details 👌
Imagine if oversimplified posted everyday, i know it's impossible. But these videos are simply amazing
I have heart atack im in haven :D And can we get battle of viena
Did you actually get Morgan Freeman to do the pigs voice?
“I hear voices all the time.”
Haven't watched yet but i just wanna say, I LOVE THIS GUY
You know what why not! If you can take a moment and listen you can start to hear the drum beat of war. Lets kick it off. If they come peacefully will pit 🍁 for them I stead of stars on the flag. If not then force it is. Prelude to WWIII lets rocka roll
This was good really goodI expect nothing less from you guys Please make Vietnam oversimplified next please 👏👏👏
Mom can we have emu war?  We Have emu war at home.  Emu war at home:
Finally, more awesome content.
Haram War
It’s safe to say this is the funniest oversimplified video since the emo war  The ending especially was beautiful
Do russian civil war next
10:38 with our prime minister ranting on about peppa pig rn i think it's safe to say this entire parliament is accurate
BEST - THING - IN - MY - LIFE
His videos are improving so much its unreal. Ever since I saw the ww2 video years ago I was thinking this is the absolute peak of content. After the Napoleon video I was like "this is it, this is as good as editing/demonstrating" and now this.... Hats off
Christmas came early
I'm wondering if the number if views you get is proportional to the number if hours the video released. 16 hours ago and 1.6 million views.
When talking about America invading Canada then you were so funny😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
The Pig War (?) well, can't say I have ever heard of that conflict before. Interesting. When I first saw the title, I out of context to history the history subject thought of Feminist declaring war with all non supporters (especally white males sigh). Alternative the Vegans declearing war against all meat eaters!
Not to pop your bubble, Oversimplified.. but Biden would definitely drop the ball if we went to war with Canada. Lol.
Could you make a video about how Prussia united Germany
33:29🤣🤣🤣🤣lmfao I'm on the floor right now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What if Texas was a empire?  Gonk
Bruh we waited 6 months to get this? Where tf is the Vietnam war(which you said you'd do "soon" back in 2018 or 2019) or 7 years war, something like that
After 5 months you release a video on the war that isn’t even a war with the most try hard jokes ever and it isn’t even a 2 parter as well as  re using models sorry dude but this has to be your worst  video
I hate Cutler, he killed Black Waddles from Gravity Falls. I would just definitely shoot him.
After emu war I was expecting something different, to be honest
America needs to figure out the Second Civil War first before bringing war to Canada..
It was at this moment Americans enlisted in the army by the numbers with one goal in mind Canada’s Maple syrup 🇨🇦 🇺🇸
Can you do the 1821 Greek comeback agents Ottoman Empire
Someone escalated at the end xD
the vietnam hint in the map room was cute :)
Pig war
8:46 most American celebration we have. Ik cause I’m american. Lmao
"I can hear voices" damn he must have heard god too
very nice
Eyyyyy my king is back!
The harram war
This man rivals Linus Tech Tips with his transitions to sponsors
Oversimplified, do you listen to drake?
the man we thought abandoned us, returned with an even more weird sounding war name than the emu war
oh if the US invade Canada, the white house will definatly burn. again.
16 hours ago and 1.7 million views 👍
*It's 5am and and is about to sleep.. Gets a notification that OS uploaded*  What is sleep?!?!

You really could have left out the last minute.. With the influence and reach your vids have, i wouldnt put it past certain dummies taking it as a serious idea..

Wait Hey Arnold is real
31:00 Morgan Freeman?!?!?!
That ending was truly splendid! BUT DON'T YOU GUYS DARE INVADE THE CANADIANS! I mean where else am I going to get my maple syrup from?
Benjamin got rekt
3:38 "It's my density!!"  I understood that reference!
Woke up to this I thought I was dreaming
Invading canada wouldnt be hard. What they are gonna send the hart family to fight us?
The ending was glorious.
the video's ending was worth the price of admission alone.... eh?
vietnam war when
It may take 100 years for another vid but its worth it
Ues
Can we germans decide again who owns what like the Panama canal
Been 6 months but who cares
Technoblade has entered the chat...
the ending was slightly worrying
when is vietnam war there.
How the hell is this more than twice the length of your World War II episode
This gives me hope there might be a video on the Aroostook war
It's perfect
Oh canada, you gotta stop bein so British. And by golly do we gotta stop bein so american
The lord has blessed us once again!
Why does spuddy have sonic shoes?

Vietnam war
Finally, he returned
My friend Is Canadian I would think when she watch this She would laugh so hard but idk about the ending   But yeah It was so funny yeah 😂
Finally 😭
RIP spuddy and porky
I do think that the voice of the pig was quiet nice 31:00 .         Also first time we hear another voice besiedes the one from OverSimplified himself. (I think)
The history legend has posted...
That’s a masterpiece.                    Why don’t you make something for Italy?
New Video YAY!
OMG INTRO SO BASED OVERSIMPLIFIED I LOVE U
I'd love to see a video on the Scottish Wars of Independence. Would you ever consider it
WOW IS THE BEATIFUL VIDEO.
The best video in my life!!!
Oh Canada
This harny guy sounds like he gave zero fucks 😅
The king is back
UPLOAD
Finally an video
It's funny to me, that compared to the USA, the UK was actually the reasonable party. Oh America
Oversimplified even can make a boring ad into entertainment, how cool is that?
annexing Canada wouldn't solve anything. we'd still keep asking you for oversimplified war of 1812
as somebody living in Washington, I always love going to the San Juan Islands and reading up on the story each time I'm at the San Juan Island.
Star wars nah pig war YES
The ending of this video was so Chaotic, I loved it
This was bonkers 😂
the ending's gold XD
IT'S MY DENSITY!!!
The US can't manifest destiny in Canada because they're mostly white people 🤔
After 6 months
HBC is now American MAW HAHAHAHAHA
As a canadian if we get invade by america the first step is offer mapple syrup
In the next video (I hope it will be in the next 2 months) can you make about the Chinese civil war?
My only complaint is that there are new videos every 4-6 months, I wish there were a lot more, these videos are awesome!
Quasi War, please!
ukraine war
You know people wanted more content when u get 1.7M views in 15 hours GG
And so begins the usual tradition: -watch this video like 100 times -wait for Mr.Terry to release his reaction and proceed to watch that a few times -the pain of waiting 6 months for an other masterpiece -repeat
world war 3 is comming up russia is sending a war threat on ukraine .
Damn, cant tell how glad i was to see OverSimplified make a new video.  "What a time to be alive!"
The pig's voice really gave me a scare, dont know how oversimplified managed to get morgan freeman to voice in his videos
Oooo. It was entertaining to see this. I had first found out about this 'war' when I visited the San Juan islands back in 2018. So I knew about Lyman and the american camps. But it was definitely awesome to get to see the 'big picture'.
37:11 Dude u need to chill out 😬
Turns out man disappeared for five months to make plushies 💀
Great video   But pronounced Berkshire incorrectly
"that  doesn't mean there white people" what 🗑️ cause  I'm black
VIETNAM WAR PLEASE
HE IS ALIVE!
The what war
I went to those islands, nice islands. You can see cool orcas.
почему в начале видео я увидел флаг России?
after 100000000 years he finally uploaded
26:30 Shoutouts to Steamy McSteamFace
I speak for everyone when I say. Thank you for your history lessons in a funny, modern day, South Park like animation format (: we’ve learned a lot
I am ready to watch this  every single day until the next oversimplified video comes out. Pumped already
damn, no mention of point roberts
I think the real pig in this story was the USA.
Wtf?
Pig:dies  USA and UK:almost starts a war
Bro irish war of independence?
After watching end , rip Canada
Oml he uploaded
can you make a vid about Alexzander the great
*standing ovation*
Idk man, i doubt i will buy the plushie for i'm afraid i will enrage it and get punished severely
A little more pizazz, eh. Yeeee Haw!
Even if you invade Canada what about Mexico? Also What would Bidens plan be, give the Canadians loads of American guns then claim the only arms in Canada are American therefore you win on a technicality?
When I saw this noti I immediately clicked it
Why are  these not shown in schools?
Yooo omg it’s finally out
Babe wake up oversimpliefied upload a new video
As a American, never have I before wanted to invade Canada so badly after watching the ending of this video
YOOOOOOO NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOAD LESSSS GOOOOO
FINALLY SOMETHING NEW
YAAAAAY
prepare your wallet's boys we must get  the oversimplified plushie
Jesus Christ that ending XD Oversimplified legit sounded almost exactly like UrinatingTree when he goes full Yinzer Mode
I find it funny that the Americans are always the instigators
to be honest i can feel the energy of General Scott beating Harney
I would love i if oversimplified did a video on the winter war
2:49
What if you create a video about like lithuanian poland commonwealth
Oh yeah facereveal
The sad part is that he is not going to upload for months now
Is that why it's called a pickett fence
Every USA state border be like: -Straight line? -Straight line.
I'm not from Canada or USA but the ending is really funny asf
How aboutttt next video about finnish wars agains soviet union please :3
I like how the characters are more expressive in this edition
7:34 this should be “ OOOoOoh NOoOoOo!”
i truly died at the ending HAAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHHA
Will you make a remake of your WW1 video someday?
Buchanan!!  Aaaahhhhh!!!!!¡¡¡
Friendship ended with The Napoleonic Wars oversimplified. Now The Pig War oversimplified is my best friend.
Oversimplified. How about an episode about an Indian King ( Ashoka, Akbar) or War. Or maybe our struggle for independence.
Well that ending was unexpected, but as a german I now have to decide who owns Canada.... We will give it to Island.  A german guy from a federal republic in centern Europe has spoken.
por DIos eres el mejor
😂😂😂😁😂😁😂😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I lovr that you can tell that whole end rant was done by Canadians in his comments section
Americas : yeah we got a huuge continent but sure , we want those tiny islands too , pffff ,
“I am covered in poo and I am luckiest man in the world “ 😂
As an American this is the most accurate portrayal of Manifest Destiny I’ve ever seen
The ending was intense and good spectacle
:l. One tiny problem with that invasion idea. NATO, UN, n the vast allies Canada has.
I was hoping for Vietnam why are you here?
rasputin oversimplified next?
I suggest making about Vietnam war. If u do it,i will be grateful :)
Sending the ending to my Canadian friend lol
that amount of passion from oversimplified is legitmately scary
Best ending ever
I love history  "How were ancient men able to build such a technically difficult and architecturally perfect thing like the Pyramids"? "We're not sure yet"   "How many sheeps were there in Victoria Island during the Pig War?" "1,369, of course. And one pig"
Cool
Imposible
Canada better watch yo self.  LOL
I think you need to make videos somewhere in asia or africa, im getting bored with europe/american story :/
your voice changed
At last, I have awaited this.
I would love to see a Mini-War episode about 1812!!!
Do the greeco-persian war next!
Nice work pal always love history when it’s taught by you
Searched “Oversimplified” cuz I wanted to watch some old videos, and I find A NEW ONE! A fantastic start to my day
That has to be the most terrifying ending I've seen on Oversimplified
i cant be the only that heard Morgan Freeman at 31:06
You could say that the ones that lost were turned to bacon.
Considering we share the largest border in the world probably for the best that US and Canada   Are good allies now
your my favorite.
these are getting more cringe
Yeah, screw Canada! I ain't aboot that free health care lines or their maple syrup! Vermont syrup is better!
Canada will be part of America soon enough MAW HAHAHAHAHA
I love how the ultimate decision was put to "neutral" arbitration by Germany when a) as the new land power of Europe, they automatically had a rivalry with Britain, and b) Bismarck's best friend was American. God bless John Lothrop Motley 😂
And here i thought America and Canada would never go to war. But i guess even friends fight sometimes
Evil pig lol
invet candda
HE IS BACCCCCCCKKKKKK
The craziest ending ever
What the hell was that ending xD I’m still laughing haha
I like Simpsons
You didn't even MENTION Point Roberts!
Vietnam when?
Could you do some video related to Poland?
I think he's gone full american
These videos are getting better and better every time.
OverSimplified tarter pack  1.Nord VPN 2.Memes 3.A understandable funny documentary 4.Rarely post 5.History stonks :stonks: 6.Honey
7:15 Wait what the fuck That's what it's called?!
18:58 19:37  I've watched this a bazillion times and I am still laughing like an idiot
Jeez, did anyone ever SHARED something throughout history? You both had thousands of miles of land accross, who gived a crap about some tiny islands?
Straight line? ... Straight line.
I did not expect this video and the comedy made this 10x better 😂
Thanks for making my day ❤️  Now for bingewatching all the oversimplified videos over and over for the next four months 😂
Finally a video..
Why on earth if the merch plushie 25 dollars???
The greatest early Christmas gift one could ask for
Come at us Yanks, we never lost a war. 😜 Whether that's because we have powerful allies or not isn't the point. 😝
Can you please do a Video on the yugoslav wars
im sorry but tbh this video wasnt as good as expected at all, still fine tho, the topic was just not so fun
3:52 "I hear voices all the time" just straight up killed me hahahaha
Biggest lie it was the British burning down the Whitehouse. It was the Mohawks ffs. The British didn't know the land to pull that shit off.
Yea baby let's go
I wasn't ready for the pig talking
I am so HAPPY That He Uploaded.
Canda
by far the best vid
Return of the King
You're an S-tier youtuber. Thanks for doing what you do.
Thanks for the upload after 6 long f**king months
HI!
Oh yeah did y’all not realize America annexing Canada to become to largest strongest power on the planet is the ace up our sleeve ?
Switerland (End of the video): * still somehow being neutral in this war *
Glad to hear your alive. Still waiting on the Vietnam war
The legend is back!!
YoU nEvEr TaLk aBoUt SpAiN (because this is how it works lol)
Yes he is back
New vid finally
Highest quality content on the internet. Easy.
8:00 was he referecing the song All Star by Smash Mouth from Shrek?
When the world needed him most, he came back.
The probability of Canada going to war with the us pales in comparison to the probability of Canada going to a civil war
it takes half of the year to make a video but im still happy
36:57 For those who want to go straight to the best part.
37:15 Me an European: WHAT THE F... AM I WATCHING?!
I never thought oversimplified would have released that much energy as much he did in this ending.
Wake up babe new oversimplified dropped🥵
Ok now do the Balkan wars
I live in Germany So if an American and a Canadian can't agree here on something, just let me know
Who else knew the nordvpn thing was coming the moment he said don't use my computer xD
Poor Spuddy :(
YES! OVERSIMPLIFIED!
10:24 - Thanks to OverSimplified I finally know what is the scepter at The Houses of Parliament for.
Canadian`s : you don't talk about us. Oversimplified - refering them as British throughout the video cause they were still under britain and technically British
LMAO 14:28 🤣 🤣 🤣 what a legend
Usa:So who could settle this Island issue? Britian:I dunno. We need someone to rely on and who will be honest with our represantation of our claims. Usa:But which Nation would that be?  Out of all the Nations on the Planet. Out of all the choices. It was diddly darn Germany.
31:00 hardest I've ever laughed watching a oversimplified video
So much humor for a so forgotten event that isn't talked by many nowadays for blobvious reasons but still bloody hilarious
It's so crazy how these videos are getting better, funnier and weirder every time. Totally worth waiting for!
I still did not see the entire video but Maybe Mexico will come in and say that this is not theirs and that they already acquired that land but America and UK don’t care (I know this doesn’t make sense and obviously isn’t in the history but I just watch these videos for fun)
36:12 10 reasons to dislike Germans
bruh
33:30 HOLY POTATOES
10:22 this is a accurate representation of  the HoC
Pig: fucking dies  Britain: *observe*
FINALLY NEW VIDEO
4:41 I'm probably the only person who noticed that joke. I just wanted to share my appreciation.
LETS FUCKING GO
Yes nordvpn more like por
37:19 okay, that is a bit to harsh
Well this will get band in Canada.
Thumbnail looks like among us
I love love love how oversimplified has so many running gags, layers of humor and references to previous videos
Anyone else gotten by the Bercow reference? 😄
2:34 Let’s goooooo
That has got to be my favorite ending to any oversimplified video ever!
This should be the fifth miniwar
Finally my man uploaded
Next vid: WILD WEST
The Thumbnail is like they both countries have flag lightsabers.
dude i think you should probably do the indian revolution
0:47 XDDDDD 27:26 XD
Very good outro
Hm, i wonder if the comment section had anything to do with this particular video?
Germany be like: I like the soo zooo zing bi zing  Also Britian: I am al..... you know what You guys suck
Good
The ending had me, not gonna lie :3
Everytime Oversimplified uploads it's liek Christmas
Awesome content 👏 👌. Keep up the great work. Can't get enough
"thats it" racks a breech loader like a pump
LMFAO!! AMERICA!!!!!
8:00 I hear what you did there
Can we do the 80 year war next?   Information: the 80 year war was a conflict between the Dutch And the Spanish that remained on for 80 years.
This is just how i see Americans. Every stereotype on point!
I remember learning about this in 5th grade.
That last bit summed up exactly how I feel about Canada 😂😂😂
What the fuck was that outro? I don't want Canada. Canada smells funny.
A Piggy Combat Situation
Love how the pig is waddles from gravity falls.
New oversimplified Video pogggggggg!

This was beautiful, that ending was hilarious
Finally a new video I'm 200 years old now and when you uploaded the Napoleon video I was 24
We need more videos man
what is more stupid, the war of the bucket, or the war of the pig?, comment here.
Imagine if a war started because not by a pig but for a OverSimplified video.
The end was the best lol
Is this the announcement for a oversimplified what if series?
Don't you dare lay a finger on our precious Canada
Best holiday present I could ask for
Do kosovo war video
As a Canadian my back is being watched 24/7 now
I had a song about this on tape as a kid.  More recently I thought it was about that other vague treaty in Main. Thanks for clearing that up.  Let me tell you of a story of a San Juan pig. It wasn't worth much cause it wasn't very big, But it rooted in a garden and it nearly caused a fray, Between the King of England and the U. S. A.   Now the Pig it was Canadian, the settler was a Yank What the pig did to his garden was more than just a prank, For it dug up his potatoes and it tore down his fence, Since it wasn't just the first time Cutler's anger was immense.   When he saw the pig a-rootin', Lyman Cutter, he got sore. He grabbed up his musket, for the pig he tore. The pig saw him comin' and headed for the woods, But he stopped at the edge, and Cutler shot him good.   Then Cutler felt regretful and went down to Hudson's Bay, And told the clerk in charge of the porker he would pay. Griffin said, "One hundred dollars, he's a prize breeding boar." Cutler told him "I'll pay three, and not a penny more."   Then up stepped A. G. Dallas, and said, "See here, my man, You're already trespassing upon Canadian land. You know it's British country from Rosario to the west," "Not so," said Lyman Cutler, "East of Haro is U. S."   Well, the settlers they backed Cutler with their muskets in their hands. The British thought it wiser not to make a stand. The stars and stripes were hoisted to celebrate the day, And were seen by General Hamey a-sail in' on the bay.   The general came ashore and he listened to their tale. He was a man of action and to help he did not fail. To Fort Bellingham he sent 'ere he sailed away again, And down came Captain Pickett with a company of men.   Then up sailed the British with war ships one, two, three, Which made a few too many for Pickett's company. They had to find a way to even up the score, So he sent to Fort Steilacoom and got five hundred more.   Well they argued in the Senate, and in the House of Lords, And they didn't make much progress but they used a lot of words. So they asked the German Emperor the boundary to define, And tell those treaty makers where to draw the line.   Now the Kaiser gave his answer in 1872, And said that Haro Strait was where the line went through. Well they called it a war, but it wasn't very big And the only one got killed was a little British pig.
Aha yes the war of 1812 was a draw unless you’re Canadian and know how WE WON! so idk get rekted US
Nice One, can you do something on an Indian topic
I would love to see a behind the scenes video so much
I ring joy to my shitty life
Vanoss Gaming Become Nuts and he all friend together declear War Of You ! +1 OverSimplifield ! +1
Holy shit oversimplified uploaded I'm shitting myself
Oversimplified has taught me more about history than my actual history classes
1.6 million views in 14 hours.... ...i wonder how many are Americans ?
Oh Canada our home and native land.Oh Canada we stand on gard for thee 🇨🇦
don,t call me a pig
Holy shit, the ending had my sides in orbit
Bruh, 1.7 million in 15 hours. You know we missed you.
Can u please make some video on wars of Mongols,  Indians and Japanese of medieval times?I am sure it will be great content too.
you guys have fun across the atlantic
HE'S BACKK
13:55
Do Vietnam war
imagine in like 20 years history classes are gonna take this video and just use it for learning
was worth the 6 month long wait
Jesus christ, its only been 14 hours and the vid already has 1,6m views. Good job man.
Sup I reallyblike your vids and I was wondering if you can make a video baoud Bosnian war 1992-1995
more like "the american falklands"
After 6 months...
You can see the time and loved put into his one so much through out. Best one yet I think, love rewarching all your videos.
He is alive
@Alternate History Hub, the Cory's in your House, baby.
So is Canada happy that he finally talked about them? 😬
The ending tho... 🤣🤣🤣
Do a video about the dutch 80 year war
Half of America wants Canada's health system so lets just be Canadian instead
This video really helps demonstrate how America is just a much more unhinged Britain.
That ending was the best .... XDXDXD
YESSS CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY 😭
These are just getting better and better. Tnx. May we request an Oversimplified version of the Spanish civil war. (warning: it's a tough one) :)
Where Brazil content?
finally
I totally loved this All Star reference
the Canadian army is a pretty good fighting Force.     but none of that matters if you have less manpower.
I watched this video with my friend in the US Army. He is very much inspired by the ending lol
This whole story screams Murica
OMG OVERSIMPLIFIED VID
Hey Oversimplified, i want one of your next videos to be either how Alaska was found, or about the Vietnam War
Omg a new oversimplified video
why is everyone putting their top 5 moments? genuinely, such a weird thing to do lmao. has oversimplified become a home for incels and toddlers, whom have no notion for social etiquette or nuanced conversation? i wonder what must go through someone's head to think that anyone would care what their top 3 or 5 moments are? i can't get over that, genuinely stumped.  so many grammatical and spelling mistakes too; to think i thought this channel was a safe haven for intellectuals smh. the time for pensive reflection and wisdom, it seems, has ended. and so begins the reign of the mindless, gluttonous, utterly self-centred, chronically online man-child and their inability to empathise or act like normal human beings.   with success there has to be a price, and the fame that this channel has amassed meant that the arrival of the uneducated and bland personalities was all but an eventuality.   20,000 comments and I have not seen one of them that has been witty or at all nuanced: all i see are the homogenous wave of people giving their opinions on the video as if it will change anyone's day knowing that they enjoyed the video. nobody should care, and yet the simpletons support each other in their prosaic lifestyles.   to enjoy an oversimplified video is not an achievement, nor it is out of the ordinary. coming into the video, one should already know that the piece will be enjoyable, focusing instead on the content of the story rather than how it is conveyed should be the objective of the viewer. it seems the remedials,  who are attracted to high subscriber counts like moths to light and whom never venture out of their recommended feeds, are antonymous to the fundamentals of this idea.   a shame but all great things must come to an end. alas, now is the hour for retrospection aided by a healthy joint.   blaze it. and thank you oversimplified.
Did anyone else realize that the thumbnail is referencing Star Wars?
THE LEGEND IS BACK
The four pistols and a giant knife thing killed me
12:35 never knew pringles was this old
31:03 IS THAT MORGAN FREEMAN VOICE???????????
Now do the battle of mines tirith from lotr
I've always said the fact Canada exist only proves we are not an empire. We could easily take Canada  in a war and litteraly nobody would say anything!
arab version : 40 years of war for a camel
If Biden is coming to Canada 🇨🇦 I come to Canada to and then I WILL VISIT USA 🇺🇸
YESSSSS FINANLY NEW VID ITS AMAZING YES
if Biden invades Canada, it'll be the most bipartisan move in US politics, and least controversial move of his presidency
OverSimplified should do a video about the time Ecuador went to war against goats inhabiting the Galapagos Islands.
Please, do spanish civil war
And here I thought I was the only one with a dumb inside joke about an irrational hatred for Canada. I knew there was I reason I liked this channel so much!
Every video gets better and better with animation, jokes and effects. Great video!
finally you upload new video I almost worry you will stop  --,
Goblexor
Congrats buddy. You outdid yourself with this one. Well made, funny as heck and interesting as allways. keep up the good work!
I was like O MY GOSH when I saw your video
Dude, Very cool
*1859 [San Juan Islands]* Britain: We're on the brink of war over some small island on the other side of the world dotted by sheep.   *1982 [Falkland Islands]* Britain: Ah shit, here we go again.
ayo pig war 12:07 oh porky
By galley you went full nutto at the end there.
@ 3:33 you just had to make florida look like the united states giant schlong didnt you? :DDD
Drake for President. More life
There is actually a memorial on San Juan island thanking Emperor William I. of Germany for settling the issue.
Do one on Winter war and how soviets got, well how do I put it...
Biden is coming canada. How scared you must be
Man, this channels production quality and everything has gotten outta this world. Good job Oversimplified. Keep it up
Man I love your videos
15:58 The table to the left has a map with what looks like Vietnam on it, I think we are getting the Vietnam war video finally.
Hey, you gave the American a Russian gun @ about 16 minutes.
OverSimplified: How stupid people almost start a war because a pig Also him: How about I tried to start a war with an ending of youtube video?  BTW have I just heard a BGM from KSP?
37:20 the most horror alternate reality ever
Poor waddles

15:42 references in this scene 1. Map of Vietnam in the corner, possibly denoting his next video 2. Banner at the top probably foreshadowing WW2 3. NES controller on the chair These are all I found feel free to contribute
Over simplified uploaded!! yay
Oversimplified: makes video about a war between the 2 most powerful countries almost starting a war over a pig  Also Oversimplified: why yes. Ending my video, that will go into trending just like all the others, with a joke about starting a war seems like a good idea with no glaring downsides
it's been 84 years... well, six months but whatevs
54 40 or fight i says
i think it's more accurate call them as natives instead indigenous. I love your channel, keep doing the great job
Fans: We want Vietnam  Oversimplified: War about a Pig getting shot...  Fans: Say no more!!
Please make a video on India.
He's getting funnier
Don’t give the us any ideas
OverSimplified is one of the few channels I'm actually excited to see new videos from
The pig or the potato?
This was fun. See you in a few months or when I come back yo rewatch this masterpiece  Edit: I'm back
33:19 😂😂
So what were the accents like between Pacific Northwest British and newly American?
yes yes yes yes new video
the tittle promised a war and didn't deliver. it was thoroughly entertaining though.
I... I don't get it. Now is it a soup OR NOT?!
yall forgot confederate panama
7:58 I heard a bit of All-Stars here!
Oversimplified on the ending: "Almost lost my cool there"
This was the best ending ever
The monologue at the end was fucking hilarious
HELL YEAH
The legend is back after months! Pog!
pork
So both parties, for once, were mature enough to sort the matter without killing each other, despite the meddling of a nutjob general. Granted, it was minuscule islands with zero strategic interest but still,  I liked that the opposite soldiers could rather party together than shoot.
6:29 i respect anybody who gets this reference
Well I’m sold, let’s take Canada. YEEEHAAAAW USA! USA! USA!
Really missed this channel! Good to have you back
Man's taught me more history than my entire formal education has.
Wake up honey, Oversimplified just posted
Dude you haven't mentioned new Zealand like ever, please talk about new Zealand, everyone calls us the Australian DLC.  Yours sincerely, a new zealander                          JK I'm not from new Zealand, no one is.
Muhahaha the ending
Franklin always being frank
Hilarious and informative
Brilliant ending!
its a civil war episode prequel
The new video is finally here!! Thank you OverSimplified!!
7:58
Youtube has an abundance of gold. This is one of the mines.
The star of the show arrived on 37:24 onwards
The moment if you Check thats a new OverSimplified Video is out ! I dident Checkd it ! xD
So good to see new content from you. I know these videos take an incredible amount of work to produce so, on behalf of all your subscribers, thank you. Have a great festive season!
THE ENDING IS PERFECT
That ending tho.
California is Argentina
This is the most I laughed in days
Do you guys think you will ever cover the German unification wars under Bismarck? I think this could be very interesting and would fit your Stile of making videos.
History has always been filled with Krazymen then, pretty interesting
us and british sucks haha
The end gave me some serious German ranting vibes
24:27 FUTURE ME
cool but when is the vietnam war  oversimplified tho
I can’t believe I actually ordered the plushie, now my family is gonna think I’m weird, but I had no choice, it’s limited edition, looks squishy, cute and cuddly how can I say no to that!!
Just started this video and damn, never knew there was a war over a cop.
Make video for balkan wars
Why would Canada give up a kindly Grandmother as Head of State and Justin Trudeau to join a nation that actually thought electing Donald Trump was a good idea?  And America would only want Canada for the oil and other natural resources.
THE KING HAS RETURNED
Do More Videos Like This 😭🔥
As much as I support taking over snow mexico, Biden doesn't even know we have a military at this point. Seriously, just clap loud enough and the guy flops and starts a dirt nap.
LETS GOO
ah orogen this time
Will you do a future video about the Balkan war(1991-1995)?
Finally The Legend came
one of my favs so far :) keep it up!
That ending is the most epic oversimplified ending I’ve ever seen
At 3:47 it says "IT'S MY DENSITY" :D
The most surprising part about all of this is that Harney managed to keep his job after Scott found out  Friends in high places, I guess
You’re back
29:12 Oh no... 33:04 Now Harney...
You really stepped up your game in this one. Hilarious!!
I just wonder is there any other wars that are just as stupid as this or the emu war in Australia?
"He wanted to be president" Well, considering the track record of every president in the last 30 years, that's not exactly an *unattainable* ambition for someone of his intellect...
5:15 Map of Vietnam on the table to the left
Oversimplified,I thank you for the US-Canada war of 2022,just to make you happier,everything you said happened,the maple syrup,the Montreal streets,everything happened,On the behalf of the US military,we thank you for your ingenious idea,not only that,but making me laugh very hard,thank you for your contribution .This is a master peice,a reward,and a revolutionary idea.
OverSimplified is the teacher we don’t deserve
31:04 Morgan Freeman???
"see america, you've been always this way" -oversimplified
Simply amazing. You’ve really out done yourself man! Such an entertaining and informative video! Thank you for telling me all about a war I had no idea occurred :)
I love Oversimplified, Great vid. loved the ending.
hi
This is the best and most funny video I ever watch where I actually learn something.
America is found by refugees. Does that mean Trump should Invite Spain? I think he should, because they are similar to mexicans
When are u doing The Vietnam war video u promised to Make

The picture of General Harney looks like he’s either half asleep or high off his mind. Or both
Please do a video on the American-Mexican war
How are you going to take the piss out of British names for places (with the parliament scene) and not take the piss out of there being a County called 'whatcom'.
EARLY YESSSS

Wonderful video as per usual! An idea for next video could maybe be the conflicts between german south west africa and britian regarding the caprivi strip
Still amazing!
Finnaly new video

New
Awesome video, but it took SOO LOOOOONG!!!! I know it must take a long time to do these videos, but pls, we really enjoy this
I m early
well what did i expect  a war due to a pig
Finally... The American Camp Visitor Center at the San Juan Island National Historic Park has a video they can show on loop for the next 200 years!
So that's how it is, huh? That's how it's gonna be, is it? That's the way in which things are, eh? That be how it will, is it? Will it be how that is, huh? That be the way in which things be the way they are, is it?  Yes Sheriff. Sometimes, it really do be.
man having a video to bridge between war for American independence and American civil war blesses my mind
Few things in life make me as happy as I get when oversimplified posts
As a Canadian, I'm not really scared, we don't have oil or any interesting goods. 🤣
The way you drew the pigs remind me of Bubbles from Gravity falls. Great work man, I enjoyed this through and through.
After Napoleon I thought and hoped you'd make a video about Simon Bolivar 😢
36:55 - onward.  Guys. I think we’ve lost Oversimplified.
HE IS BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK
Yes of course pigs
USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh USA-eh!

I was just thinking we were due for a new video!
Sounds Like Nationalism eh
Nobody's gonna mention about his music cover at 7:57?
Merry early Christmas oversimplified!
Could you do a video on the Korean War and other Proxy Wars that were caused by the Cold War? The topics interest me and I like your video formats.
finally a new video
So... what you’re saying is... America is going to punish Canada severely..?
what great friends those germans are im sure that'll last a long time
now you will make a video on how us-canadaian war of 2022 started just because your this video XDXD
This video MUST be banned in Canada. For everyone's safety
Fantastic video! One of the best on the whole channel for sure. Well done buddy 👍
i love the ending xD and the fact, that the germans decided who to give the islands to
America could never invade Canada because  A: America would have to leave the UN B: Canada and America are good friends C: If they invade, it’ll give superpowers like North Korea, Russia, and China the right to invade the U.S, which then it would be about 5 billion people vs about 300 million D: It would be the stupidest idea ever
The best! *chefs kiss*
I'm a Myanmar people
Ah yes, the british epitome of beating someone up whilst also sobbing
That ending just hyped me up so HARD   LETS OCCUPY THE NORTH BROTHERS!!!
36:52 And potatoes :)
Could you do the 1st and rhe 2nd Industrial Revolution? (If you haven't yet done.)
If you need more American vs. Canadian content, do the Aroostock War, it’s not centered on pigs or buckets unfortunately, but trees.
Biden cant go up stairs  and here we talk about him invading something nice joke nice one.
Lol whatever you guys can come up here and take it if you want. Things be pretty messy up here lately so we could use the help
Finnaly after waiting like 6 months
I’ve waiter half of year for this. Oh boi was it worth it.

38:24 if you see on left, you can see that there is a picture of a man, if you click on it you will know that he is the voice actor of the pig (31:02)
Welp I know what I'm going to sleep to tonight
Finally, Bud's back I hope
the end was kinda sus ngl
This man gets funnier with every video
Biden is so brain dead he falls up stairs I doubt he could organize an invasion of Canada 🇨🇦 eh XD
1.6 million view in half a day!! Guys, Hire staff!! You can grow this YouTube channel!
Well, it's official, everyone. Oversimplified has lost his mind.
THANK GOD HES BACK
Ending: Did .... did you just....  Threaten to invade Canada? 😂
I really appreciate that oversimplified teaches us about the most influential wars in history; the Falkland wars, the pig war, the football war, and the war of the bucket
I'm from Brazil, and here we demand more latin American history
Noice
Looks like john wick got inspired by something...
When 3D-Printers became affordable, the Europeans printed all kinds of interesting and funny stuff. The first thing the Yanks printed was...a gun...
Why did it feel like you started rapping from 7:56?
That was the best ending to an oversimplified video you have ever done! 🤣
See you guys in like 8 years for another video 😁
As a Canadian, what the hell was the end lol
This video angered the Canadians, who punished the USA severely.
As a Canadian I loved the USA taking over Canada thing at the end of the video
Yayy!
Outro music name plz!!! 😭
Oversimplified has really gotten better at animations!
I haven’t clicked on a video fast enough..
Man I swear your channel is most recommended for history studies.........Thanks man
Bro you are alive
Everybody gangsta until your neighbour turns into NordVPN ad in 19th century
ME: NEWWW VIDEOOOOO YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
Next video: OverSimplified The American-Canadian War of 2020
CANADA burnt your yellow house down to the ground , and won that war . yes the only war that is not told properly still to this day cause  Political EGO.. cool though.
this guy is great keep doing your job mate
37:15 oversimplified true colours just revealed
You should cover the cod wars it’s like the pig war but with fish and more than one war
Nice one mate
I literally dropped by the channel yesterday to see if anything new has been posted (there hadn't at that moment) so I rewatched prohibition again 😂
was kinda hoping for a vietnam war video or something
Just what I needed after a tiring day
I don't know why you despise Canada in your videos. I know the ending is intended as a joke of course, but it always seem like whenever you get the chance to degrade Canada you do it. :(
33:27 And 29:10 The Most Funniest Moment Of The OverSimplified History
I'm down to invade Canada if you guys are
Babe wake up oversimplified posted
Best video Oversimplified ever made?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
Wow oversimplified released a video
So no one's gonna talk abt how drake will be good president
i love how the pig looked like waddles in gravity falls
There just battle for a island 😒
#3 trending let's go! Edit: Now it is #1!
What is with naval officers averting wars due to miscommunication? It has some weird parallels to the Soviet officer Vasili Arkhipov.   If you didn't know, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, US naval forces attempted to intercept a Soviet submarine in international waters. They dropped "signalling depth charges" (basically, firing warning shots) to try and tell the submarine to surface. The submarine interpreted this as an attack, and thought WW3 had broken out. They couldn't use their radio while submerged, nor could they communicate with the other nearby submarines, so the two officers on board decided to launch their nuclear missile. Vasili voted no, however, and a launch required a unanimous vote.   The absolutely crazy part of it is that Vasili was just onboard as a fluke. He was in charge of the entire submarine floatilla, so he was also second in command of that specific submarine (yes, he was both the captain's superior, AND subordinate). None of the other submarines had a 3rd officer, just the captain and political officer (who both said yes on Vasili's sub). This is how close we came to nuclear armageddon. It was nothing but sheer luck that Vasili happened to be in the right place, at the right time, to avert disaster on an unimaginable scale.
“Will the us / Canada border look like this or like THIS” that had be dying 😂
Germany made the singe most stupid decision I have ever heard: Why would u give those islands to america?!?!
Your exaggerated take on the British parliament is hilarious XD Instead of repeating the word "order, he just throws his sceptre right into a mp's face XD
Finaly i waitwd so long
Wow this is trending
Thank you for uploading! You're the history teacher my class never got!
U should make some videos on India 🇮🇳 as well

The Return of The King
Bring it yanks round 3
If the Frenches don't invade Corsica, America will get beaten up pretty badly in my imagination :/
One of these days, we need oversimplified to try an English accent😆
'Like rats or disease' that sums up americans pretty well
The USA just wanted a bit Lebensraum
zamn oversimplified is back
1.6M views in 14 hours, because Oversimplified is back to town baby!
TIL that youtube blocks certain videos by over simplified in germany/austria. even from the ADS i learn.. <3 love you guys

Drake 2022
Its amazing how many problems the usa have caused
I’m from Russia, I have bad skill in English, and I very like your videos. I hope West think like me too. Мда, мне реально надо английский подтянуть.
16:29 Pov: america hears you got oil
If WW3 ever starts I hope it isn't because US is hungry for territory
AYY HE IS BACK!!!
25:30 is a strange cut
Me when i saw the outro:  ONE EYE OPEN WHEN IM SLEEPING... ONE EYEEEEEAEAEAEAEAE
Return of the king
Oversimplified:  3:20 to 3:20 speech  South Park creators: ooh, i like that and its on
These get better every time :')
I like how each video has it's own insider.
31:03 Why was the pig talked like Morgan Freeman?
26:24 - pretty sure that closed-caption needs to be updated!
Amazing showmanship and education from this channel! Thank you to everyone involved in making this video.
next time split dat vid to get 2 sponsors pls
I love this man but he needs to make more videos
2:35 6 Janu 2021.... 200 Years Ago And This.
50 Seconds in and the founders are cast as vicious racists with no regard for human life that isn't white. Classy move.
That was one hell of an ending
as a canadian, ending was the greatest thing to ever come out of an american.
Oh my gosh a new video!!!! Finally! Thanks for putting another one together.
I can imagine the ending being seen in retrospective some years from now, who knows what it can cause?
you know it's going too be a good day when OverSimplified uploads
You’re back!
Well that was a wild ride. Can we get a podcast of this guy talking about historical politics with this style?
Can't wait to share this with my kid
Hey man, can you make a video about the Philippine-American War next?   That would be much appreciated 😊
The All Star reference at 8 minutes is golden
New Oversimplified content plus weed? This is exactly what I needed. I love you guys!

finnaly
This is the 4th time I'm watching today itself!
the grates finale of a video that is see in my life
DAY 2 OF REQUESTING VIETNAM WAR
The ending had so much freedom it turned my pet parrot into a bald eagle
Didn't know they gave PowerPoint presentations back then.
He took it way too far with a flag draped over Wayne Gretzky 😂😂😂
My favorite video so far
The legend is back with another video
26:23 Captions: "Then a bunch of terrorists showed up"  Bit harsh, OS!
Finnaly another amazingly informative fun and another amazing stupidly awsome video
There have been multiple pig wars.
He's back
amazing video
YAY UR BACK
see you in 2022
YAY A NEW VIDEO
you can do the vietnam war video any time now
Oversimplified.....can we get that ending on its own?
This was the funniest video thus far Although I was expecting the war of 1812 first, I much enjoyed this And my God that ending is hilarious As a non-Canadian, I approve
I love you and your explanation.
This is america in a nutshell
i always think Oversimplified is lonely. Ever thought that he makes all these voices alone in his bed at night?
Lol, why did the pig have Morgan Freeman’s voice?
OMFG Oversimplified posted! <3
Good video but the guy just didn't talk about Canada enough
Both sides should have gone to war, had they no honour?
Hilarious!!!
31:04 wth is this??? morgan freeman in an oversimplified video?? les goooo!!!!!!!!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I MISSED YOU
Imagine not liking manifest destiny
When the British didn't get their way, they responded in their typical fashion. By going to Copenhagen and blowing a ton of stuff up.   Oh wait, wrong script
The return of the king
that outro is a killer, signed: some poor sap in canada about to be bidenized
love the animation, and it gets better in every video
War casualties America - 0 Great Britain - 1 (pig)
Satisfaction    his voice sounds older
For 1812 I was taught that since the US goal was to annex canada and canadas goal was to have that not happen we (canada) technically won
I wouldnt be suprised if there was some shit like gamer girl bathwater war in the future, also amazing video Oversimplified.
Finally your back we love u
Finally no one can check my MarkSexyberg history search, Phew!
Hello there
ngl, that plushy looks like a oversimplified snowman, perfect timing
Damn OS, I didn't know you were so BASED
Good video
Who jump right into the comment section before even video begin
That was a fever dream and I'm so happy I watched this.
I love how history is weird as hell that it actually is worth watching
you told us 2 years ago you would make a video about Vietnam
USA and UK: go back to war again American and British People: Ah Shit, here we go again
Could you start making more of these but about middle east countries? Im really interested in that, like israel-syria in the 60s, or even arab nations in middle ages
Never imagined an Oversimplified video would end with a justification for annexing Canada into the United States.
Tips and tricks to draw borders with another country:  "Straight line?" "Straight line"
A new oversmiplified video? The day is saved!
The animation actually improved really noticeably!
That ending though
Please  make more you make history so hilarious
Turkish language plz
you're actually a very good voice actor
The thumbnails are getting more anime
Millions of views in under a day you sir are killing it
This is probably the funniest oversimplified video
BABE, wake up! Oversimplified posted!!!!
Drake for President
"who exactly  some to god" "I thought it was sharon's cat"
i am proud to say that this guy has collectively given me like 8 history hyperfixations
Doot
what next now :)
Finally you are back
No one gonna talk about the song at 7:53
Beaver business
This is exactly what I was waiting for.
Babe, wake-up. New OverSimplified video.
Man, I would love if you made a video on Simon Bolivar
That ending was literally fallout
now the ending is controversial
pls do war of the roses
Definition of futility: making a comment in the 1st 24 hours of an OverSimplified video and expecting it to be read by anyone
25:10 be got?
Finally
YES! FINALLY A NEW VIDEO!
yo u always forget india
Can you do Turkish Independence War?
I hate to say this. You never want to fight a Canadian. After all. One Canadian took pushed out the Germans from a town during WWII. Think of what a few...oh...how many Canadian soldiers are there? *does the search* Oh...about 43,000? I think we (As a citizen of the US) would never survive. Though I have a humble request. Just taste the East and West Coasts. Leave the Gulf, Mountains, and Midwest. Be doing us a big favor.
You better watch out, you better not cry, or else we’ll be invading your country tonight
Finally, after all these years, *P I G  W A R*
The big man did it
Next time on oversimplified (How a video started a war)
IVE WAITED FOR SO LONG FOR TIS
Yes finally
THE LEGEND IS BACK
I will send this scenario to Cohen brother. It's just insane! It's completely in their style
Nice! So when’s the next video?
It's been 10 000 years...
He has returned
Fun Fact: most of us ( if not all of us ), didn't know about this war until now.
I love this chanel it helped me know history and geography
30:54 also good clip
Okay, but have you heard about “The Emu War?”
26:25 ERROR IN THE CAPTIONS.  Instead of 'tourists,' it reads 'terrorists.'
Of course it's a new world country
I’m tired of Canada let’s invade them
The end really was concerning, also for me as a german
I love your vicious man keep going pleess
Thank you for pointing out that in the history of the world only white people have ever conquered and held land. That's why Europe has always been notoriously peaceful since the white people didn't want to fight one another.
crazy
Oversimplified has run out of wars to oversimplify, so now he’s trying to manufacture wars for content. 😂
pog
27:31
32:31

Me: I wonder what his next video is going to be. Vietnam? American-Mexican or Spanish War? 7 Years War? 100 Years War? Maybe the Crimean War?  OverSimplified: Pig War  Me: I'll take it!
7:58 is it a reference to all star from smash mouth?
Wow again a great video, I’d love to see a video about German unification like the Austrian-Prussian and the French-german war and all that 🥰
They should build a statue of that pig xD

Hello merkus

Legendary
A topic I've never heard of! Great! No I eye-rolling because of historical inaccuracies used for cheap jokes dampening my overall enjoyment of an otherwise amazing video this time!
Wtf
Rejoice, the history is here 🤤
The return of the legend…
You´re back!!!!!
LOL, if ya wanna visit Canada. Just come over and check out the Country. No need for unnecessary ouchies, and we have no hard feelings against America bud.  Just too busy working on First Nations rights and adaptations, along with balancing many religions and cultures ( with English and French Canadian language prioritized over other languages)😋👍
Hmmm album is copied from star wars but who cares
Its been so long
An extra long video about an obscure war I've never heard of? Absolutely! 😁
Could you make a video on Vietnam or korean war?
Loved the ending🤣🤣🤣
its really something when you had to get a voice actor for a ....pig...
Finally ✌️
I love your Videos! How long did it take you create this one?
Awesome new video :D

I dont know about you guys. But I'm hyped now to go invade Canada
Russian civil war Vietnamese civil war Oversimplified-no Pig war Oversimplified-yes
YEAH YEAH YEAH NEW VIDEO
The worst mistake I’ve made recently was not watching this video sooner. The animation, timing, humor, and complete and authentic facts down to the last second surpass even what you’ve done previously, which was already a golden standard. Thank you, and may Drake bless this great video
Back of my country oversimplified
Good ol oversimplified
I hope that last part doesn't age well.
My reasons for not uploading for a half of year, were that 1. You died; Or 2. You worked for an epic long video.
Too much comedy at the expense of characters
what the fu
Omg oversimplified uploaded!
The ending got me unprepared 😂
1010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101101011010110101
Bro you just keep getting better and better
As someone who lives on the other side of the world, I'm gonna sleep soundly tonight knowing I'm not neighbours with Murika!
I normally love your videos, but I cannot sit here and allow this misinformation to continue to spread. The only casualty… a pig! What about poor spuddy! Did his life not matter? Justice for spuddy!
That ending was superb
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
YEEEES OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED
Am i the only one who can't watch the baby Hitler video?
Except we’re already allies. Ok part Axolotl soooooo
The only thing is that he only uploads 2 video parts in a year
OMG OMG YOUR BACK YESSE
Exactly why not take Canada
Well great my countries empire literally lost a possibly good ally because of giving the islands to the Americans
Please change the beeping in your music man. Its driving me nuts

No oversimplified, no fallout timeline. No American invasion of Canada.

"With their.... affordable insulin."  *shots fired*
I love how for the pigs you made them look like waddels from gravity falls. The beautiful nostalgia is coming back to me.🍻🍻💖💖👌👌
So you waited till after dislikes were removed to post this.  Curious.
One of my favourite channels man
This was all just a big roundabout way to give reason to invade Canada
Think getting like from oversimplified
That ending took a REAL hard left x'D
The King has returned
Love this channel and the ending was great except no one really believes biden is gonna invade anything. He doesn't even know where he is most of the time.
Vietnam war?
Next war MUST be cow war
This was a weird video lol :D
You should make a video about the Irish war of independence
I am a Filipino

The ad transitions are something else
How about Philippines
That British Parliament scene was gold.

Oversimplified lost it at the end
7:56 I too like popular meme song by popular music band Smash Mouth that was featured in the first movie of popular ogre, Shrek
The fact that the videos on this channel have gotten so much longer to the point that you're talking about something called "the pig war" for nearly forty minutes blows my mind, soon you won't be able to call yourself oversimplified anymore.
Thanks so much for this video
When is vietnam war coming?
bruh
the star wars thumbnail  Beautiful
The pig is Morgan Freeman 31:02
Hope you do more videos like this love you man
The return of the king
The pig reminds me of the pig from Gravity falls.
7:57 I like the All-Star reference :0
Poor pig 🐖
“Well that just got weird” -me every 2 minutes while watching this video
Before you begin your 'invasion' a gentle reminder it was the Canadians that were kicking US butt in the war of 1812 :P
I thought this dude was dead. Genuinely worried. It took 30 years for this guy to put a new video up
You made us to wait  a quite long, but wait is worthy
6:56 These videos take a while to go out, but god damn the CGI is getting better with each one. Keep it up my man!
Man, the comedy was on point this episode!
its time
The ending was a nice touch
Straight line?
That was fun, see you in 6 months guys.
I absolutely love this channel. It is 100% my favorite channel and I wait with bated breath for the next video.
I told my friend about this channel and he’s watched like all your videos in one week
I want that plushie so much. Too bad i don't have money
I love the page and haven't finished the video. Just wanted to comment on that remar about the expansión being possible because non-white people live there, is ignorant af because during this period, all europe did was kill and take each others land. As was the comments practice everywhere else in the world. Let's drop the lies that the world has existen for 6000 years and wars or conquer only happened in Europe and oppressing non whites. We get your American  and everything has to do with "combating white supremacy" and supporting the "historically oppressed". Just tell the truth. It's already bad enough most people aren't intelligent enough to know anything and will blindly believe that yes, war started in Africa as soon as Europe wanted to conquer it because it all looked like Wakanda, And white people was jealous, or whatever makes sense in non sensical thought. Anyway back with the video.
A good video for this time of December.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY NEW VIDEO LES GOOOOOOO
Good video mate, but you should totally do a video about the war of 1812
Pig War, Cod War, Emu War, Salmon War... What next, the Llama War?
6 months damn
Ngl, I forgot about this channel.
That went places both expected and unexpected eh?
A VIDEO
As a Canadian, I don't think I've Ever laughed that hard at an Oversimplified Video, they are Funny but that ending was something else XD
Waited 6 months for a mini series 😭😭😭
We should just take over Canada.
You don't talk enough about the Netherlands in your videos!
That ending 😂😂
when they started cheering the mole i just could not hold it anymore
Is this where the term "got off Scott free" came from?
More please? Please please you are my favorite Youtube channel. Do the korean war!!
Thanks for the angry birds star wars 2 reference thumbnail
plushie
i was this close to flagging this video at the end, but i decided if Canadians are cool with that then i don't have to do anything about it
You invade Canada and i'll resurrect the German, British, French, Ottoman and Japanese Empires to kick your ass
The US should have gotten the whole Oregon.
Thing is, how hes ranting about canadian invasion is how I imagine americans back in the day acting whenever they invaded something.
Morgan pigman
You can pinpoint the exact moment Oversimplified snorted some coke while making it.
Coudn't be anymore woke than this.
Love your videos! Do you think you could make one or Vietnam or Korea? Have a good day!
YEEHAW!!!!
There was no need to kill a cop like that.
3:37 anybody seeing something they wish they didn't, maybe something with Florida in between USA's legs?
funny, I thought it was mao zedong who popularized about the correlation between political power and guns, I guess he must have heard of it from an american
Calling somebody with a banana on his iron. Dude, I love your humor.
Love your videos man
Any Canadians in the chat?
Bruuuuuhh!!
Worth the wait
Techno war
i always thought he is getting more crazy with each video and today, maybe, he finally broke...and i love it!
The best history channel on YouTube.

Please make more videos more often🙏 I've been waiting so long 😊🎊🎉
Can someone tell me what music plays at 26:50?
*The man.* *The myth.* *The legend.* Blessing us yet again with a new absolutely brilliant video!
That thumbnail...... just muah. Chef’s kiss
Who Wins?
Just as i asked myself man i wish oversimplified made a new video, and after 1 day i see this. MAGIC
McClellan was a close friend of Pickett from that West Point class of 1846, seems like they were good pal for a reason
Can you make a video about the Greek revolution?
There was a trade war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia from 1906 to 1908 also called The Pig War
You helped me get an A from your "King Henry VIII" video. Thanks :)
How about Bismarck?
As America's brain get smart, their head gradually gets dumb.

new oversimplified video poggers
4:10 This shot is the best thing I have ever seen in my life. I had to pause so I could laugh.
Can we have a Mexico oversimplified video?
Petition for oversimplified to make a Peloponnesian war video
As a Canadian, please don’t lol
Every time I see a new video I get so happy 😁
So, there wouldn't be just a war over a YouTube video, would it?... Right?
This had to be the most strangest, scariest, and best oversimplified video.
Welcome back!
Friend: Hey what vpn you*Mmphmh*  Me: Shhh he will come and *Ripping sound* Oversimplfied: IM GLAD YOU ASKED
OMG This is amazing Finally a new vid and Im gonna try to get the plushie(Also I think the gun noises were the shotgun sound effects from Roblox Jailbreak)
Are you okay
OverSimplified
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming." 7:56
Uploaded
the previous videos were better
hey over simplified you where on the official Lithuanian radio!
I'm so happy you have uploaded but can you do the Irish war of independence. Please please please please please please
Finally a new video. Love ur content btw!
I’m so torn. The humor and ESPECIALLY voice acting has never been so top notch in these videos. I’m over here laughing my ass off while simultaneously being so fed up with my own people just being selfish assholes at every turn to a point where this really was infuriating to watch  12/10 would recommend
18:16 this is why this chanel is the best chanel ou YouTube edit:  19:11 this is also why
The return of the king!
As much as I like Maple syrup, I think the US is more likely to become part of Mexico than Canada becoming part of the US.
You didn’t mention Alaska
Still waiting for Vietnam War. Anytime now.
This video feels a little too woke not gonna lie
FINALLY
HEY USA, HANDS OF THE NORTH! They are too nice anyway. What on earth would you do there?
What about the balkan wars?
13:06 This is by far the most peaceful parley ever.
Canadian here, sure, so long as we get Alaska
This is just beautiful
now im gonna demand more Asian history.
NEW UPLOAD!!!!
You were 2 years too late to make this video my friend… 2 years too late
16:00 why the hell is that american shooting with a AK-47?
I LOVE these! Feels like ages since the last one
This is.. BEAUTIFUL
The longest video on this channel wasn't about the French or Russian Revolutions, it wasn't about the world wars nor was it on Napeolon.  IT WAS ON FUCKING PIG WAR.
omg that ending
Yea spread like a disease like the ancestors of the native tribes who came to North America and wiped out the existing people and regularly eachother.
Pickett: "Well, that was the most humiliating military situation I'll ever be in. At least now I can show my true potential in this Civil War!" Longstreet: "Uhhh, Pickett? Lee says you have to hike across that field, up a hill and straight into those lines upon lines of cannons and angry Unionists..." Pickett: "...*AwWwW NOoOoOo!!*"
I will soon have test from Biology, wish me luck. Mihajlo Bogdanović

Heyo oversimplified. Love your videos. Heck of an ending on this one. Love every second of your videos. Also could you maybe cover the Meiji Restoration?  It’s a great one ; )
President Drake lmaooo
this half year was horrible for me personally, but man, every new video from this guy, can even the scales to the bright side... even if you need to wait half year... i mean Kurzgesagt, Oversimplfied and You suck at cooking... 4 parallel universes ahead of us, leading us to sanity
I was wondering why Pickett sounded so familiar! :D :D :D :D :D :D   HE WAS THE ONE WHO KILLED THE PIG AFTER ALL!!!!!!! :D :D
I see what you did there 3:33
38:10 AMERICAN-CANADIAN WARRR 💥💥💥💥💥!!!!!

Best ending to anything ever
Pretty much expected Germany to just take the islands for itself
27:25 best thing ever
hey look it's the thing from chessed gamon
You know it’s a good episode when 10 minutes in OverSimplified rips off All Star (in a good way)
At this point Biden's approval ratings are so low, he might as well invade. Canadian Bacon 2
What about the winter war
He is finally back
it's time to buy new headphones
Best gift I could ever ask for💯💯💯
0:33 Damn. Just...damn.
Haha, the C&C reference was fantastic!
To be fair America invaded Canada in the fallout universe.
The Best Vids Ever!!!!💯👍
Why am I not surprised.
:O
Oversimplified is the hero of the Canadian Conquest of 2022.
Hi
I love these videos they are the reason I  know about history my class and I know the Canadians are gone and grabbing their guns,PLEASE KEEP MAKING THESE VIDEOS.
I love you Oversimplified

*Breaking News: The Owner Of The Educational Channel “Oversimplified” Had Overthrown Biden After He Refuses To Agree To His Proposal To Invade Canada* _”Its aboot the threat of invasion” a local Canadian said._
7:58 Somebody once told me that Oversimplified is a great channel!

You made me watch a video named the pig wAr and a thumbnail based on star wars this better be good he got shot heated at the end didn't he?
This is your best one yet!
Finally, a new video
TBH, bidens old ass has allready made a shit ton of bad decision himself as soon as he became president
Times have changed, Our kids are getting worse! They won't obey their parents, They just want to fart and curse!  Should we blame the government? Or blame society? Or should we blame the images on TV?  No, blame Canada! Blame Canada! With all their beady little eyes, And flapping heads so full of lies!  Blame Canada! Blame Canada!  We need to form a full assault! It's Canada's fault!  Don't blame me, For my son Stan, He saw the darn cartoon, And now he's off to join the Klan!  And my boy Eric once, Had my picture on his shelf, But now when I see him he tells me to f*ck myself!  Well, blame Canada! Blame Canada!  It seems that everything's gone wrong, Since Canada came along!  Blame Canada! Blame Canada!  They're not even a real country anyway!  My son could have been a doctor or a lawyer, rich and true, Instead he burned up like a piggy on a barbecue!  Should we blame the matches? Should we blame the fire? Or the doctors who allowed him to expire?  Heck no!  Blame Canada! Blame Canada!  With all their hockey hullabaloo, And that bitch Anne Murray too!  Blame Canada! Shame on Canada! For... The smut we must stop, The trash we will stash, The laughter and fun, Must all be undone, We must blame them and cause a fuss, Before somebody thinks of blaming us!
The return of the king
The end is funny lol
Hilarious ending
I would like to meet this 7th Earl of Jizzingham
Holy shaat oversimplified is baack
Could you please talk about the Israeli Palestinian conflict
OS is back!
Glad to see Europeans have always use the 'straight line' border system. And I'm glad to see Americans always have been Imperialist in their own way  And that ending, this mf put his soul on it, and I love it
New video omg
Love it
The end concerned me as a Canadian
Therapist: It’s ok Mr. Douglas, the Americans are not coming to steal your lands again.  *National emblem plays*
The legend is back
bruh cnadaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  a a a  a a  a a a a aaaaaaaaaaaa a a a aa  a  dead
Yea "technically" it was the British that burnt down the Whitehouse but those soldiers never left Canada so technically it's a war between Canada and the states
Great video, love your content. However when will the Toledo war be covered?
YAY a new video :D
Biden is coming to Ukraine cause Russia is going to land troops there
Amazing work
This is the best channel on YouTube
I see that some animator loves Gravity Falls when it comes to character designing pigs.  <3
The day oversimplified uploads a video is like a festival for me
15:35 corvette vs mini cooper
Do gombe chimpanzee war
I’ve waited so long for this
I hope you do European History videos apart from the world wars like the German Empire, Austria and how they became what they are today. Basically the entire European continent.
i see an oversimplified, i know my day is about to get better
Yesssss
FRICK CANADA BATH IN OIL
This fits perfectly on the list of useless wars. Pretty much like the emu war. All in favor ?
You are alive
I love this! And also when you said “like Americans they pulled guns at them”
The part where the pig got up killed me.
So cuddly! So cute!
pov oversimplified upload a new video: YES YES YES YES!!!
Hey Oversimplified, can you please make the Philippine Revolution and how the Philippines gained its independence.
“But the Americans just keep coming and they don’t stop coming , hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running” was not something I expected from Oversimplified
Do the balkan wars next
Pooggggggg
at this point the Hitler video being blocked in everyone's country is a meme
Wake up babe new OverSimplified video just dropped
I am not against the peaceful expansion of the US border to cover everything north of Panama Isthmus all the way to the polar sea.
Fantastic as always 👌😂
Very nice video very funny. You should do Bismarck or Punic Wars someday.
I saw nothing short here of American greatness
guys i believe the next video is a vietnam video. so hear me out. Go back to minute 5:21. Look at the left there is a vietnam map. I dont think thats a coincidence. Nice easter egg lol.
And you don't talk about India I am in india
Please make more oversimplified videos.
FINALLY
Been wating patiently for this
Use me as a dislike button
Who wants a Vietnam War? I V
Bruh Im Canadian
Boy, I didn't even know you have videos blocked in my schnitzel country. I will turn on vpn and watch them right after this video
I think that the next episode will be about the battle of Brisbane of 1942. All in favor ?
I like your new way of the video
The legend return
Yes
Is it already christmas?
wtf was that video. i love it.
18:30 Is that chekhov’s gun?
Woah, Deja vu
Long time no  see 🌚
Sir we need more of these endings please  Sincerely,  A Brit
Good vid
Humanity: It's just some funny incident about a pig, you don't need to make a 40 minute video on it oversimplified: Hold my beer
Good cid
Can you please do yugoslav war
Haven't finished watching yet but now I'll be mad if the term picket fence wasn't originated from this mess.
That ending tho, Oversimplified here not retelling history, literally STARTING history
The intro made you a better youtuber than Mr.Beast
Cool plush
He is alive
Morgan freeman as the pig made me lol
"Straight line" "Straight line" - And I thought I was lazy
Wonderful video 🤩🤩🤩
Calling the War of 1812 a draw has to be the most American thing I've ever heard in my life.
legendary video like always
"Look at us boys! We've only gone and bloody done it! We've beaten the Brits, and secured independence. Now to expand westwards, and conquer the rest of the continent!"  "Um, Thomas, it looks like a bunch of different people already live out west."  "What? Oh no. That means we can't expand. I hate my life!"   "Whoa whoa whoa, I didn't say that they were white people."  I love this channel.
32:46 I'm at a loss for words
Instead of the Pig War, maybe it should be called the Idiot Island Incident.
Return of the king
This is the closest I've been to being here when a video was uploaded!
Amazing thumbnail and video. If I were to request one video from you it would be the life of Zachary Taylor, the slave owning southerner who did want to expand slavery.
Best content creator on YouTube by far
wow, just wow. Super video, thanks:)
I wanna see the look that the childrens will have when  teachers show this at a cannadien schools thinking it's a fun story to know about!!!
AWHH YEAH
peeg wor
we need a General Harney right now to deal  strategically with  China
I thought this was fake for a second
Here before this gets much more millions of views.
Still waiting until polish-lithuanian commonwealth :/
YES finally a new video
I CAME AS SOON AS I COULD
War of 1812: America tries to invade Canada, and fails, then spends the next 200 years calling it a "draw". Sure guys, it was a "draw" and not a "embarrassing loss for America". You can pretend to keep your dignity.
YESSS
That ending has got to be, hands down, one of the best endings on YouTube. I’m Australian-Serbian, have absolutely no real connection to either Canada or America, but wow, just wow.
The ending was absolutely beautiful
your vids just get better and better
after seeing that intro i am going to buy a plushie
I didn't even noticed that i watched every minute of this video.
Dude... VERY COOL!
When we needed him the most he returned
Mate this video hard not to laugh at! Keep up the good work!
10:57 Oversimplified R34
Great
Hahahaha. Great job as always mate. Waiting for an India Oversimplified someday
"Get Rekt" LMFAO I just spit my coffee all over my keyboard
His art went from good to perfect

Be honest, for a moment we all thought the voice actor of the pig was Morgan Freeman.
Canada is important, I am very happy now, thanks oversimplified
Thank you! You remembered your youtube password.

It was the piggest war humanity had faced at the time
23:55
Best one he’s made yet, keep doing it like this
Is Biden planning on pulling a harney?
That first jokes a strong one
As an American, I don't wish American healthcare on my worst enemy, let alone Canada
Hey oversimplified you should make the Vietnam war oversimplified

When the world needed him the most, he came back.
5:55  Caption this scene

OMG A NEW VID

Hey funny history stick figure man posted again
Whoa dude. That ending caught me off guard.
You touch Canada. Me myself will declare war on the USA lol

13:06 I knew sheep was a language
why does spuddy have sonic shoes
YES BOIII HE IS BACKK
I love how general Scott called general Harney a psychopath while punishing him severely like a psychopath
Oversimplified's videos are quite literally, each better than the last and it's very noticeable, great video dude, you make learning fun! A collab with Kurzgesaght would be super awesome!
Best episode to date just needed the end credits and it would be a move!
0:00 - 18:35 Before the pig 18:35 - 18:45 Pig 18:45 - 34:00 Military Escalation
Loved it but can you make videos fast
OMG HES BACK YAY!
Great video it looks like you improved a lot!!
Drake might be a groomer.
words are worth going to war over there
He didn’t forget Canada :’)
Umm over simplified sir can you make a plushy of yours a size like a normal pillow
Haha, I'm in danger.
6:30 that history 😂

gravity falls - hell yeah nice vid
2 years later: "The 2022 YouTube War"

Love that Steamy McSteamface made an appearance
hehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
can you please do a balkan wars video
My top 3 best moments in this video 16:29 - 16:39 is especially, I actually laugh The British Parliament went silenced at 10:27 At 37:21 feels like this ending is the best of all Oversimplified content.
Love these
he's back
That ending was so epic!  And I’m not even American OR Canadian
Christmas has come early
FINALLY
Is that pickett the same one as in ”general picketts charge” during the battle of gettisburgh?
The waiting was definitley worth it
The best history YouTube channel ever!!!❤️🌹
Canadian like American?
The animations just gets so much better. The sound design even more...
Yesssss
Aw hell yeah!
Oversimplified returned with a new video. surely!
It's worth to wait 6 months for this video. But I was thinking that your making the Vietnamese war
This is by far the Funniest Oversimplified Video I've watched
4:08 U.S. in a nutshell 😂
The sheer joy this gave me.
Finaly a new video
Goddamn boy! This video was so quality and funny as hell. Your videos are the best. Educational yet entertaining all the way
I am a simple man. I see an Oversimplified video, I click.  Also, the _glorious_ war of 1812!? Gimme a break! xD
You know you are a legend when you manage to put all stars lyrics in a history video
N A N I ! ?
The parody of parliament isn't even satire. It may as well be video footage.
this is my  2nd time rewatching i will reply my comment once i watch again
Humor at its finest
Angry birds in a nutshell
So,the pig died for nothing...
I was today years old when I learned that Hey Arnold wasn't making things up.
You know it’s a good day when oversimplified uploads
Finally
I am from austria but more Canada please
Haha I feel included now, thanks eh
For the record: Berkshire isn't pronounced the way it's spelt, much like the American State of Arkansas. Berkshire is pronounced "bark-sheer". (Not as odd as "arr-kan-sore" though imo)
Day idk I forgot of suggesting the gulf wars.
38:18 I tried to propose a resolution for this but it failed
You mean the war about me?
You can try to make a whole series on Indian Independence. it literally about 200 years
THE LEGEND BACK
I love the cameo from Morgan freeman, glad to see it
next video indian revolution
“Lyman,if you spare my life,I will grant you three wishes”  *BANG*
I’m glad you’re still alive
This is pretty much how most Canadians view Americans today lol
31:00 I immediately thought of that one Avatar episode where Appa stands up lmfao
All that for a pig! 😆
Next up... South African war please
Could u do the spanish civil war?
the ending was the most American and horrifying Oversimplified has ever been
What I rate about these videos is how they are consistently funny throughout the show, there aren't just odd moments of it switching back and forth between humour and serious history lesson.
mole! mole! mole! mole!
Great video, just what the fuck was the ending???
Pre -1900 1950 2000 2021 NVM- politics be like: 0:36 - 0:50 PS: 100 buckies are 3.5k(technicly closer to 3.6k but nvm)
Its amazing what humans are willing to fight over
Sorry oversimplified not your best video but you should definitely make a Vietnam one
It’s official. Drake for president, 2024.
This one had so many hilarious moments it's legitimately the best video so far  I'm thoroughly entertained, thank you
I am so glad your back I love your videos I have been waiting forever for a new vid.
This was worth the wait
I am even listening to the adds so the video isn't over that far
oh no the narrator has gained setience and learned about a patriotic revolution oh God–
Please
Do the  Mexican Revolution and the American Mexican War
More canada plz
there are so many flaws with the idea to invade Canada, would the provinces become states? Would Canadian Bacon become American bacon? The Americans could lose and then we would have to many people saying “aye”.       BUT WHO CARES BECAUSE I LOVE THE IDEA OF DRAKE BEING PRESIDENT AND MAPLE SYRUP THEBEST AMERICAN FOOD AND WAYNE GRETZKY WAVING AN AMERICAN FLAG AND WHO CARES ABOUT THE CANADIAN NHL TEAMS NO ONE LIKES CAREY PRICE AND THE MONTREAL CANADIANS OR CONNOR MCDAVID AND THE EDMONTON OILERS
YES.      FINALLY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hey dude  Why don't you make a video on Indian independence?
The King Is Back Baby!!
I love how oversimplified introduces us to the wars that most people haven’t heard about
I have never heard Oversimplified talking in such an amplified and patriotic voice. This is based.
FINNALY A NEW VIDEO :D
please do Vietnam!!!!!!!!!!!
3:38 Ah yes, *d e n s i t y*
How did i start another Oversimplified binge and magically get anextra video
PRAISE THE LORD. AN UPLOAD :))))))
When the historian need him the most he come back
Sadly some in America will be proud of their relationship with guns. Despite the obvious harm caused.
Please make a video on Indian independence  It’s full of action betrayal and stuff idk I studied it long ago but I mean it’s interesting  🥺 👉👈
Finally a new vid, I have been desperate for this Oversimplified.
this all felt like a fever dream, every time I was like "ok it'll even out" things got crazier and weirder. early america, man. wild.
Hey,just a favor but could you Oversimplify (Moistkritikal)"Wooooo,yeah baby" just a request
oh, say CAN you see
19136 comments in 12 hours? Awesome
Love it xD
That ending XD If that would happen it would be very interesting for global relations
They should have just made it sovereign native territorie Islands.
it makes me angry that the americans always got away with theit bad behaviour
I would like him to do a video about the nika riot next
37:00
Awesome cover
Why do I suddenly feel like building a rocket........
I hear voices all the time
11:07 deja vu
Pig war go brr
whens dat 'nam video coming out?

I laughed so hard when Benjamin Franklin got roasted
See u in next year.
pls roman empire
13:00 i lost my sh*t when they started talking like sheep.
Is Technoblade in this?
I love theese vidoes mahn
I was just rewatching Napoleon Oversimplified 2 days ago and thought to myself, “Hmm, it’s been 6 months since a new video. I bet he will drop one very soon.” Sure enough. Great video as usual.
I love the sign (can you imagine) with allise and axis power county s in it
If America invaded, they would only make it through the prairies before giving up and freezing their nuts off. Challenge accepted, USA.
A Star War artstyle for the thumbnail. Perfect
This along with the football war should be part of a playlist: "dumb humans make booms for stupid reasons"
Holy crap, He got 1.5 Million Views in 12 hours-
Yeeeeeeeess!!!!!
Th
America doing a Crimea on Canada
The lord itself uploaded
Every time he posts my day gets a lot better
It's crazy how consistent the quality of his videos are. I wouldn't have noticed if this was made in 2019.
The best video in the YouTube BY FAR
OverSimplified is like that one teacher you had in school that no matter how you were doing or if there was a problem they made it better. Like this dude probably gets more people into history than schools could ever hope for.
Biden couldn't change his own diaper but it it high time Canada becomes North montana
17:00 Isn't the little blue bit on the peninsula to the north still bordered like this to this day? I think I read before that there are actually americans living there, and their kids have to cross the border four times every day just to go to school.
Vietnam war would be sweet
Can you do Vietnam war oversimplified next?
The humor in this is fricking sharp
19:13 music name?
THE ENDING WAS A MASTERPIECE HAHAHAHAHAHA
Fun fact:I ues free vpn to watch his video
Yay he uploaded
The best video of your channel.
American mounties are cursed and I want it  Petition to invade Canada  The fucking ending is the best part. Ever.
These just keep getting better and better, keep up the amazing work
Oversimplified becomes president of USA   Canadians: *General Concern*
Finally!
The amount of enthusiasm in the end was hilarious, I am still laughing
Well that ending..........was interesting
FINALLY NEW VIDEO
Thats a  movie
Benjamin Franklin: look at those curves British dude: I'd worry less about Canada's curves and more about your own curves, Benjamin.  Imma use that.
Hey oversimplified,I love your vids so much,you’re better than my history teacher,could you make some vids about Japan history?
18:21 the potato has Sonic the Hedgehog shoes lmao
The ending omg 😂
Man i wish you could drop videos more often
I've been saying we could and totally should annex Canada for years.
I'm down for invading Canada. Anyone else?
7:39 this is Chimney Rock in western Nebraska, the most referenced natural landmark along the Oregon trail. Nice job oversimplified. It's the little things that makes you such a great channel to enjoy
Americans being Americans ay 😂
And the title of the funiest video ever gose to this video
I live for these videos
About Philippine Revolution
You should do a video on the Tomato war of india and pakistan. Basically the indian government banned the export of tomatoes to pakistan, due to which tomato prices went up in pakistan but for some reason the indian goverment didnt expect Pakistan to start importing them from iran due to which tons of harvested tomatos in india got wasted for no reason. Other than that theres the Pigeon war too lol
**Pig starts talking and walking like a human.**  Me : 👁️👄👁️
Great Vid, but can you make a video talking about the Crimea war in Ukraine
Did one of those colonist said as response who talked to God: "it was Schrödinger's cat"?
My chrismas present came early this year!
You are the only one who teaches history and makes me wanna learn and listen to it willingly.
The curves... i laughted for 10 minutes straight      Then watched again for 10 more minutes of laughing
Best channel i ever see.

The ending: Never heard oversimplified this glorious before Am gonna die of laughter
The last gig was pure gold
That was so good, but maybe as a next idea, can you do the Pacific war (ww2) on oversimplified, Pearl Harbour, midway, leyte gulf, etc.
I wish dislikes were still available so you could see the 👍1,000,000 to 👎1 ratio.
When the United states secured their independence?? let's be real without france you would still be british
The legend is back
Nice
That ending was so patriotic 🥲
3:54 I hear voices all the time
Imagine a string of events lead to Continents war because one youtube video😂
Sureeee..... A pig ... If it was now , two conutry would be nuking each other.
Love ur vids hope you keep drawing you are amazing.
How about you do the shortest war in the world? One I heard was like 30 minutes or something, wouldn’t even need a part 2
Can you make the greco-turkish war of 1920?
37:22 Extrovert at quarantine

Scam, there is no Technoblade
If you attempt to invade us, say goodbye to the white house
The ending, to quote you:  "He went full megalomaniac"
i make sure if i sleep i will open my 1 eye open if im in canada thanks :)
What a great birthday gift, thanks Oversimplified.
racist against white
Any day OverSimplified posts, is a good day!
Canadians: You don’t ever talk about us! Oversimplified: I will once we invade you Canadians: That would  be a fair compromise that would satisfy both parties and I will not AGREE WITH IT!
3:33 that Florida dong
This is piece of art!
Two thieves fighting over what do not belong to them. When will God punish these people?
Imagine being close to starting a war because of a dead pig
I need a minute after 33:35 I couldn’t stop laughing
finaly
I recognised Charlie's voice impression lol
Fun drinking game: Take a shot everytime he says ''British''
Out of curiosity: In which countries are the videos about WW2 blocked? Definitely not in germany - then who else could be that sensible about it?
Hey over simplified could you make one on the Roman Empire
hi
Noice
keren banh
Oh my god that thumbnail is perfect

The Canadians went quite after oversimplified's speech
Man, i wonder which Dictatorship doesnt allow this educational video about hitler?! Oh, its my own, its germany
Oh please... Even an Aussie like me knows that Canada would just apologise for holding American land for so long =P
_______________________

37:31 american mounties actually look sweet
It's a good day when Over Simplified posts.
Damn, Its really worth the time to wait all this long for the new video
Nord VPN…..WTF 🤣🤣🤣
The SMALL size of the island makes this history is more funny than it is

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I KNEW HE WAS PLANNING SOMETHING BIG
YES YES YES!!! I'VE WAITED SO LONG 😭😭❤

Congo wars
The moment I see this on my recommended:  *FUCK SLEEP OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED WOO*
Am I the only one who saw something else at 3:31 ???😂🤣 Tip: it is located in Florida.
26:25 “A bunch of tourists showed up” Captions: “A bunch of terrorists showed up”
I think this is the alternative world where all of the Trump Supporter Decide to invade Canada Instead of their own Capitol Building (37:16) And btw           Canadian : U S Eh ?
Pin this comment for good luck in your YouTube channel :)
=jjjj làm phụ đề Vietnam đi oversimpl

Do one on the war of 1812!
YAS NEW VID HALLELUJAH
Pig wars, rise of the straight lines
We waited for so much, and here he is
"Watch every BTS video", damn my man Oversimplified knows me well :)
This man is the goat
You could make a movie out of this
So cool
Don’t you think an Irishman would understand the love between a man and his potato
He’s back again!
This , this is what I was waiting for.
Ooooo
Me seeing this while watching techno blade: Hmmm yes fine content
Its the Christmas spirit!
hey can you make video on yugoslavia war, thank you
10:22-11:00 As a Brit, I can confirm that this is a 100% true depiction of the daily goings-on within the Houses of Parliament.
7:47 those beavers are wearing hats that were probably made out of... beavers? :-O
Please make a Vietnam War video
yES fINALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCHO GRANDE!!
Fun fact: In my hometown of Vancouver, Washington, we have a grade school named after William S. Harney. And a Hudson's Bay High School, but that's not really relevant.
The amount of time it took to make this video must be draining  Amazing video !!
Sleepin with one eye open, every day until Oversimplified uploads again
Thanks you for  your amazing animations oversimplified
hahahhahahahahahah
Finally a new video of the best yt channel
Straightline.
He spend 500k $ on one line from Morgan Freedman! That's what I call dedication!
I moved to whatcom county a few years back, it is beautiful here and worthy of fighting over idc
I love more obscure history videos like this! Thank you OverSimplified!
I missed you @OverSimplified
I’ve never clicked on a notification SO FAST. Brilliant job as always, king! Definitely one of my top favorites
Man, OverSimplified here spittin' bars 7:58
Love the star wars thumbnail
Nice video. I've actually lived in Friday Harbor (main town on San Juan island) for a few years I will say it is a quite beautiful little island with a small community.
YES NEW BIDEOO 🙌 👏 ✨ 😍 👌 😎
K guys see you next Christmas
pog
What a great video
31:15 dhar  maaan oversimplified
Invading Canada would be the dumbest thing to do.   Nice Joke!
Add a smile on the plushie and paint it black       :)
That pig is sus      No literally, the scientific name for Berkshire pigs is Sus domesticus
7:58 - 8:02 all star reference
Babe wake up, Oversimplified posted a new video
2 points.  Canada really does exist at the mercy of the United States.  Seriously if no one cares that Russia took Ukraine territory a few years ago would they really stop America from taking Canada's?    Also love the videos, but this one glossed over major historical points just to paint America's and white people in a bad light, and that's kinda odd.  American expansion didn't happen because no white people lived to the west, it was because natives were different tribes who had wars with each other and wars with the Americans.   Natives tended to not settle in one spot and raided settlements, Americans retaliated and then Natives retaliated.  It wasn't a genocide but wars.  Wars that turned barbaric at times from both sides.
I live on san juan... its pretty ok
Blessed my birthday
Good
Zulu war please
10:24 this is exactly how the British government functions today
nice ending
finally
stop your hangry, have a nanaimo bar eh?
Aha, still sponsored by Nord VPN I see 😏
Alternative ending: Mexico owns the islands
It’s a miracle
Your channel is amazing. It takes so long to release a video but when you do it's always equally ensightful and hilarious. Thank you so much for all your efforts and giving a pig Morgan Freeman's voice.
Great as always, you should really get a Netflix special.
Fuck. YES. Liked and appreciated. Will watch later. You're one the YT channels one me list where new content brings immediate joy to my days. *shoutout to Ahoy, WilliamPapadin, Letsgameitout, AdrianGray, AndrewRousso and many more.
Man this was the first video of yours I didn't like.
Love these videos, so informative, yet also just entertaining as hell. It's like 03:00 but I'm definitely watching this whenever I eat breakfast tomorrow!
Fallout fans :  Boys the time has come
President Drake would be lit no lie
Yessss!  Been waiting for a new vid. Thank you sir
You took this conflict about as seriously as it deserves to be taken
being from san juan island  kinda cool to see this
The pigs look like waddles from Gravity Falls
For the greater good!!
Next vid could be about Ireland maby
Why does this look like what I have in a fever dream
Sorry but American military record after ww2 sucks ass and the world likes Canada more anyway
Lol

Shame the British stopped at burning down the Whitehouse.  They could've looted the statue of liberty! And redid it as a monument to Queen Vics mighty tits!
I missed my uncles funeral to watch this blockbuster
its like when you want a new video he just comes with a new video,like if hes planning on something,big?
So happy to see a new upload…deff one of my favorite channels.
while I do believe that we could defeat Canada quite easily, because they're weak and...Canada. but I must ask, is oversimplified okay? do you hit your head wrong? Canadian girl break your heart?  something isn't right up-stairs! you've gone mad! you've SNAPPED!!      lol jk.....fuck Canada!!
Britain: America stop manifest destiny. America: *freedom becomes immortal*
The Bacon War sounds better
If people of Canada find out about the ending of this video, they will be mad at him
Usually OverSimplified videos are educational and funny. This one though is both educational and chaotically funny.
Honey wake up, oversimplified posted
30:59 is the funniest meme
7:58 is this a shrek refrence
I think I’m going to sleep with on eye open tonight….
Please oversimplified keep uploading your videos it's fun to watch as well as informative..

I do wish we went a little bit easier on the Buffalo
Good to know he is alive

the ending make me want to die lol🤣

aaaah, i missed these, :)
Imagine that one day, we will watch these videos back with our children while telling them how we used to laugh with history. That would be cool. Espescially if you have a meme kid.
The way nord vpn went into the history video is WAY TOO SMOOTH😂
Napoleon saying "hey" is so funny to me

Mudrenych used to translate oversimplified videos and now oversimplified making the videos about the same things mudrenych did.
Great video man.. Love from India. Keep up the good work
This video is so incredible that it literally  doesn't have dislikes
Invading Canada? Is this world Fallout in 2077?
This is the exact reason I don't like the USA...
Oh Biden's coming all right, to buy affordable diapers
I literally started to rewatch your videos yesterday, wondering when your new vid will come And there you are!!! You’re awesome man)))

30:17 Come for the pizza, stay for the "Fair Trade Cotton"
that ending was the biggest plot twist since 1976
6 days  war
pog vid
when he says I'll eat your eyes
The way you describe historical events with good humor and funny jokes is amazing :D
Come on, the ending was too harsh on Canadians.😂😂
OK... I kinda late and ignorant about matter of Canada so any people please explain to me, why Canadian got on many memes and jokes?
This video was too wacky for my taste
great quality content
27:26 I absolutely lost it here. Lol
How does it feel to be my favourite person ever?
Can you do a Polish-Russia war from 1919 to 1921 please
Ten uears later: Can a video start a war?
Straight line? Straight line.
Oh shut oh sit oh beach
As a Canadian, that last bit instilled some fear in me...But perhaps you're one president too late.
Yay new video
Lmao ok oversimplified you went crazy at the end but still loved it 🤣🤣🤣
That would be awesome 37:47
That end tho
I was just wondering where is oversimplified? Now my thoughts were answered
Have you ever considered doing the Irish war of Independence? Sounds like a fun video!
This is what iam waiting for a month. I love your work. Thank you so much.
37:13: where oversimplified got carried away
OMG FINALLY
Bamboozled. I thought this is the war between UK and US in the past..
Oversimplified is BACK BABYYYYYYYY
Funniest episode yet
Лайк не глядя
The WHAT war again??
That rant at the end really scratched the spot. I mean, why is Canada still a country? Well, not for much longer...
I’m I dreaming they uploaded?
Oh WW2
Bidome so be coming for the Canadians
Add English (United states) caption
Awesome as always!!! had a lot of fun!!!!! TY
Awesome as always, how about a video about Prussia? would really appreciate it
So basically, This video was made just because some angry Canadians in the comments keeps telling Oversimplified to make a video about Canada?
Holy shit that ending was intense
Christmas came early
This video is about to start a war and all canadians are in danger !!
You should be MANIFESTALLY DESTINED to upload every month.
I love the fact that this video had a longer run time than the world war 2 vids!
Yep. I just spent more than 30 minutes on watching about Western... stupidity.... err... craziness.
I cant wait for the video on theSpanish American war.  That one should have ended with the Americans invading Spain.
Poor James Douglas, having his British sanctuary infested twice by American.
What are those lands called now?
Yay a plushie
India  pleas
He got them killing all the bison
Fun fact i live in the town where james k polk was born/lived
this guy leaves for 6 months, then comes back just to post "the pig war"
This is kind of cool. I've never seen my hometown in a history video!
The only reason why Canada still hasn't been invaded is that it uses Nord VPN
The all star ref was truly magnificent, thank you man!
Hell yes another OverSimplified history video nice!
yes finally a new video!!!
Germany definitely wanted to piss on the British by awarding it to the Americans.
Well that was definitely not how I thought this video was going to end 😂
HE HAS RETURNED
The ending is the most american thing i've ever seen
YEEEES
I love your videos please make more
My potato senses were going off, I knew that QUALITY content dropped
Video suggestions: Industrial revolution Bismarck Crusades
Yo this video was particularly hilarious 😂😂
The ending gave me the most patriotic feelings I have ever had, and I'm not even american
Back then: WW1 7 Minutes Now: Pig War 38 Minutes
Christmas came early my guys
It's real and not a myth OverSimplified is back
Could you imagine in an alternate timeline where kids learn about the Pig War and the teacher goes "so basically thousands died over a pig" and they're expected to agree with it lmao
Let's imagine what do the people in the next room react when they hear you shout at the mic about invade Canada
That ending..... was truly..... THE AMERICAN DREAM
After so long welcome oversimplify
Just amazing 😄
FINALLY
31:02 Hello, Morgan Freeman
Lesssss goooo

Quality content as usual
I live in Seattle so this hit a bit close to Home... I Love it!! Now I really need to visit the islands...
finally
dude, I've been waiting like half a year for a history lesson from you!
You need to be preserved Oversimplified. Great work as always.
New OverSimplified video > Christmas
So did anyone else think of that one Hey Arnold episode?   Just me?
“They made me cry like a big girl!”
Oversimplified will never get old, always watching him.
3:53 "I hear voices all the time"   lmao
Here we go
YEEEES A NEW VIDEO, Im so excited !!!
That roast at the start between Benjamin and the Brit guy is so dope
Two good video ideas could be the British empire and also Romans and celts and barbarians and stuff, love these videos
yeah id be down to take over canada
1.4 million views in 11 hours, oversimplified we love you
WE NEVER LOST A WAR. WE WILL BURN DOWN THE WHITEHOUSE AGAIN
Do a video on east African indipendence from the British
Lmao I just noticed spuddy is wear sonic the hedgehog shoes
@OverSimplified calm down :D don't start an invasion in Canada... uhm.. Please?
Irish civil war?
Your quality skyrocketed for this one it looks so good, and every joke landed perfectly they were awesome
"Your connection is so safe"  "Who the hell are you?"
I never realized oversimplified could do that kind of voice acting at the end  or was it acting?
OoOOo
This video was awesome
Can I just say how incredible the thumbnails are for these. They’re really eye catching.
Regarding the end of the video.  Then Justin Bieber would be American. Not Canadian.
Finally another video 😃
My mans had so much fun with this video lmaoo   I think he took a shot every time he said “British “ and “American”
This is gold.
This video is clearly an improvement from the others, Jesus I watched the others so many times :v
oversimplified? 40 minutes
Britain seriously needs to take back the colonies
we still kicked your ass , yall yanks tried 3 times to take over canada and failed each time .
Man the animation of your videos got so DRASTICALLY better it's amazing You're amazing
I've watched this video 4 times in a row and am still having a blast. One of the best videos to come of this man!
Why cant my Teachers explaian this well
33:32 I've seen it tens of times already and it always makes me laugh. Hilarious.
After making us wait for so long if the video had been a second less than 38:42 then I would have pressed DISLIKE and Unsubscribed
Dislike number of Canadians have disliked the video
Happy "Chris"tmas
YES
Im a simple man i see a new oversimplified video i clicks. :) thank you for the superb content.
A Canada - USA war? Dude. So uncool.
Mom finally hes uploading
the ending...
POG
Being a Canadian, we invite the challenge of invasion, however if it’s maple syrup your after, go invade Quebec, those sour frenchies barely even want to be part of Canada already so they could use a good invading to see how good they have it.
Huu bttt BAAAAAAAAH 13:28
The legend has returned
YESSS FINALLY
Best channel in YouTube, hands down
Christmas has come early!
Finally
can confirm that 10:55 is the state of the British parliament
USA: you underestimate my power! Canada: don't try it!
im not from canada nor america, but im scared
28:45
YEEEES NEW VIDEO YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I Thuin hé went insane at the end
Were have u been oversimplified
Im not saying i am against the idea of having a country that takes up almost all of north America. I'm Just saying that it would be a political and monetary nightmare. Not to mention Canada, still falls under british rule, as they have a constitutional monarchy the queen being the queen of england. Although they would be used to a racist leftist subbing Mr brownface for Mr jungles in schools. I want no part of of dumb stuff that happens in canada.
Oversimplified needs to do the War of 1812.
I would love a video on the 1916 eastern rising in Ireland

why do I have a feeling that the video ending will cause a comments war
I like how OverSimplified changed from an explainer tone to a patriot within seconds.
Woooooooo a new video!
that last part was ironically true and we should not let that..... hold on wait a minute? Biden is al.... ok well we are screwed.
A master piece
The last part of the video was said with so much passion that I am starting to believe it to be true.
Can t w8 to see this video other 200 time so I will be ready to see all the 200 reaction
WADDLES!
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO
There was war betwween Serbia and Austria-Hungary that is also called pig war but it is quite different from this one.
New vid pog
As a Canadian, I hope they do invade. We’d like more freedom.
The Return of the King.
we got the bucket war, now prepare yourself for . . . . PIG WAR, next we will have Toyota war
I always love your stuff, mate.
37:23 Nope! You Will Not Invade I As "Canada"
Ok, this is I think the best video you've ever done
harney kinda reminds me of someone from the present
Star Wars : The Ultimate pig war
You're finally back!
Cool
Please make a video on colonization of India.
.........and he's back⚡
What about Ireland? Hehe
“Hey United States of America and Canada, we need to change the borders due to a small parts of  America becoming Mexican territory.”  “Okay. But what do we do?”        “Straight line?” “Straight line.”
The ending will TOTALLY NOT cause a war...
26:30 - Steamy McSteam Face 😅

please do the treaty of waitangi in new zealand, it would be awesome to see the maori wars
Y’all may have got the San Juan islands but we got free health care. Canada stay winning
After a long time
heavy anti colonization vibes. without the americans and canadians, north america wouldve looked like africa but possibly with more murder and sacrifices. so save the virtue signalling
I laughed so hard at the psychotic break at the end :D :D. amazing video as a whole with a cherry on top. Thanks man :)
Hold on so the Americans have been Biden their time
Yay new vid
the pandemic didnt treated you well, right?
I have been waiting for an upload from Oversimplified, and its here with my morning coffee, what could be better :)

I’ve been waiting, you’re as beautiful as the day we met😭😭😭
Bring out more videos more often man
Vietnam War next pls
they said nope              war
33:26 outplay pt2
Anyone else notice Iraqs eagle emblem on top of the American flag pole at 37:45?
Man, I feel bad for Charles griffin. These sweaty Muricans.
He most likely sacrificed his entire Canadian audience just to give us that gorgeous ending,Respect.
me: thinking the next oversimplified vid is the vietnam war oversimplified: ARE U SURE ABOUT THAT?!
27:26 to 27:30 look at the island
You are the best history channel in the whole world

Oversimplified has the best product placement dude can't change my mind
How long to let him make a video for us to watch? Guys?
Canadians are just the improve version of Americans

I prefer wars to be fought because of more meaningful causes, like a fine bucket.
Yaaaaaaassss!! A new one!!!
Where have you been
USA to Canada: I declare war. Britain: OK, there's gonna be tax for that.
37:17
GOT has the best plot twists ever The ending of this video: hold my beer
Me when I was watching the video: hehehe, this is funny  Me after I watch the video: WTF Oversimplified? What the hell were you thinking? We can't go to war with Canada, that'll start WW3, I object to Waging War against Canada
...      Bring it you damn yank. The British empire will not back on a former colony
32:47 - 33:37 is my favourite part I swear I laugh every time when I see it..
Wow, imagine my absolute shock when white people are made out to be villains within the first minute of a YouTube video in 2021. 😐
Never knew my state of Oregon was like this back then. Wow. This is why I love history :D  OMG that ending had me laughing XD

Lmaoooo the last part
You’re finally back!

Today on youtube on hottest video you see is Pig war
Oversimplified is the Prove you can be much better than the one who inspired you   😂😂you American want Canada now  🥵Quebec is total Opposite of Florida man you will become icecream  Lol 💝💝🇺🇸🇮🇪
I  miss you!
I'm sorry I have to ask, Wtf was that ending. The rest was great, really enjoyed it
THAT ENDING LMAO WHAT
You always forget India ???????
NEW VID LETS GOOOO
I see that "answering to iron like it was phone" is universal joke.
An Irish man in love with a pig and an American in love with a potato, I think something is wrong here but I can't pin in down
Yeah!  Annex Canada!  And Mexico too, while we're at it!  You know what, let's just annex the world!  Mwahahahahahahahahahaha!
Lmfao I thought he was going to start talking about technoblade
1:19 One of the most savage jokes ever :D Hahahahahaha
Great video! Any plan on making Oversimplified: Vietnam?
Oh my god the ending almost killed me lmaooooooo
the more videos he makes the more emotionally unstable I think he becomes
It felt like years since oversimplified uploaded, I've been rewatching WWI, WWII and the Cold War
and make vids faster pls cuz i sat my lazy bum on a couch for five month for this vid and i watched every vid
You manage to make 38 minutes go by like 5! Gotta always watch the time so I don't miss appointments when I watch your videos.
Let's get a broad topic video (or series) on the Korean War:  Lead up to, cause, battles, Chinese/Russian interference, was MacArthur crazy, the whole shebang
Next: ww3
27:26 Favorite Part
When people needed him, he came back
and cecong idc about this cuz im bri'ish
“Jizzingham” 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i watch this vid and i liked the pig war thingy then the end about this war is insane and may not happen because of the north atlantic treaty org' and all of that canadian vs usa war is only possible in dictators no peace and the roblox rie of nations
Anyone else think that the pig looks like Waddles from Gravity Falls?
"Thanks to level-headed minds, and an eagerness for peace and cooperation" - this is the least realistic part of the whole story.
Babe wake up, new oversimplified video
i was just wondering when you would upload again awesome
Pig war part 2 coming soon….
holy f**k that plush is so cute. i want one.
isnt this vid a bit too dragged out? this is mini-war material but you stretched it out too much
Nice All Star reference at 7:58.
Nordvpn is just free money for him at this point lol.
It’s my density lol
so
All those people expecting this to be the Vietnam video xD
Yes yes YEEEEES!
we should have given the islands to the british maybe then the  world wars would have been in our favour :C
Kaiser Wilhelm I. obviously aproved of the american dream. God with you amricans!
Seeing the pig walk made me realize that no character in this has actually walked before...
man we miss u
bruh
wow, muricans been like this since 18s?
also ur not talking much about indians
You see, the US won the dispute because they had Virginia man on their side. No one can defeat Virginia man except for another Virginia man.
hellllllll yeahhhhh, sooooooo loooonnnng
Wow the end of the video reminded me of south park
Damn it
26:26 "...and a bunch of terrorists showed up" turn on subtitles btw
first thing that came to my mind was "war of the police officers"
Ending: me: American invasion Canada I don't think so Canada ground force strong America attacker and the Nuclear is can defeat him the modern The UN not allow use Nuclear bomb what Happens no UN can use bomb and also canada be supported british army
That glorious ending. Canada? I think you mean N O R T H   M O N T A N A.
US :- We got our Independence .  Also the US :- Now its time to take others .
Bro I dislike the US.
new vid wen
HESS BACKK
desenho do general parece o Lula
37:17 This fucking ending is the greatest thing on YouTube. I'm still laughing my fucking head off, tabarnak!
The thing is that this channel upload video pretty long but they are high quality and are actually funny, and also simplify Complicated stories that make it pretty easy to understand(and make the viewer enjoy history)
1:26 lol

Welp, seems like I won't be meeting any Canadians in the comments anytime soon.
Oh boy didn't expected that ending 🤣🤣 awesome 😂😂
Oversimplified must be killed at all cost
If u spare my life ill give u 3 uhhhh!!!

claim before 20k comments ticket here
WHERE IS NAPOLEANIC WARS PART 2
Vietnam when
🐷 : “Lyman, if you spare my life, I shall grant you 3 wishes”  **bang**  So sad, so emotional 😭
The Americans wanted to expand to have lebensraum just like the nazis
Hey Oversimplified, i am a great fan of your content and always will be. Just a small request, please make more videos on non-american history. We've historically had a relatively lot of knowledge of american history because of hollywood and other reasons. The stories from the rest of the world don't get the equal share of audiences as they should. With you and your platform it can change. Please make a non american history video as you used to.  Anyways, major love and respect to your work. Cheers!
Jesus the pig granting lymem 3 wishes was hilarious
And, I missed you oversimplified.
That "straight line? straight line" reminds me of the two dudes meme 🤣
guess who america helped in ww1?
Damn, this gag about americans and McDonalds hits me all the time
Oh I didn’t know Mcdoanlds existed in 1783 4:13
You sir, are a fabulous,fabulous creature!!  I love you with all my heart and soul!
The sad part is we all know we have to wait another 6 months
I bid you goodbye from oversimplified my Canadian friends. And respect to those who stays.
1:22 outplay
Fort Vancouver is still standing and I drove passed it everyday for 2 years and never knew what it was till right now.
Fina fucking lly
I mean its not like anyone has anything else planned for 2022. Might as well go to war with Canada.
Ahhh... GUESS WHO'S BACK!  I am a high school student, who used to HATE social studies, but you helped me sooo much in my assignments and tests, and now, I LOVE IT ❤. Thank you oversimplified. You make not only history, but also the real learning unleashed from within. So glad to see you again
why rarely upload videos?
we will still annex canada; someday. so it is written in fallout 3
Biting satire. I love it.
Darth Pigious
where vietnam war?
that ending was better than                ...this.
This is the funniest video I’ve seen so far
33:23 Holy shit look at him in the door 😂. Just straight up looming.
finally after 5 months
He- shot- the- pig!!!!!!!
This was surely the greatest video yet👍🏻
Gonna order ALL of the plushies
NEW VID
Sequel cool.
This will be our best day in a while
The Pig War, even though there wasn’t really a war, because that would be stupid
technoblade would be proud
pls make a video on ottoman empire
7:57 we just got all-stared by oversimplified
I love these, best content on youtube
See you again in about 5 months
Чел такая не самая важная история а ты на неё посветил столько времени этот ролик можно было уложить в 7 минут
Make a video on the philippines indipendence from spain and america and make a connection also to other teritorries like cuba
That was glorious
this was one of the worst videos you ever made.
US invading Canada nowadays would probably be the most retarded act they can do and I totally see it happening.
Please do Yugoslavia War next
Waited for many time!!!
One of the most American endings ever. The Wayne Gretzky bit had me rolling 🤣
I’d be down if we invaded Canada cause they wack and weak anyways
Finally a Worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary -Emu war
no
That end but was actually hilarious
Straight line ___________________________________
Hey Oversimplified pls do a video on the partitioned countries which were one in the past like Korea India Czechoslovakia ,etc.
Holy shit this ending, im preaty sure his fucking high XD i love you man !
Nice now i can put that doll in my jar
Well that's the loudest and most fierce ending i can ever imagine on this channel...
Yay u uploaded
ph - america war pls
33:28 gets me every time
It would be good if he did a video on the Irish war of independence good videos though good work on all of them they all teach me something
Best damn thing on YouTube
please do the troubles next, i need that simplified
Here we go again
OMG new video. I opened your profile just the other day to see if I have missed something since there was no video for quite some time.
It’s 3 am. He uploaded. Time to get the day started boys!!
Pls make a Indian revolution video
This was the most FRICKIN' funny video i've seen so far
FINALLY ANOTHER UPLOAD
Absolutely great video as always! By making videos like these you make these obscure parts of history more mainstream to the less history inclined public. Very commendable!
The Vietnam war is missing
Baiden's coming baby....that has to turn into a meme.
UK: so ya know about that island that an American shot a pig on it? USA: yeah UK: who should the island belong to? USA: IDK, I'm busy rn UK: then who should we leave that to? USA:* spins a wheel* USA: the German Empire UK: oh fu-
Make a video on india
That was awesome!!!!!!!!
everyone: you never talk about canada me: you never spoke about lithuania/poland/latvia who have an amazing history, like a king who rules over 2 countries at the same time, and how the last european country became cathlic, lithuania though insignificant today was quite the marble in history, check it out someday
Winfield Scott xD 34.00 xD wtf going full on Mexican war on Harney
Damn I remember my friend recommending me oversimplified in high school, subscribing when he has just ~50k. Now I miss an upload cus of finals and 1.3 million have beaten me but that means that also 4/5 of his subscribers don’t have notifications on
Lotta emotion in this one huh
Can't believe Waddles' great great great grandparent from Gravity Falls almost triggered a conflict between nations
General Scott: Stop, stop, this is getting silly.
You dont know how long i have been wating for this. well 6 months ig but THANK YOU.
That opening lol.
i lost it, this is the most funny disturbing episode ever XD
"YOU SWINE!" "No the swine is the one I killed. I'm Lyman"
In an American school in 2069 Teacher: Children today we will be discussing the causes of the American-Canadian war History Book: Watching an Oversimplified video of Pig war
Wow, you made Creepy Joe look even more creepy!
Please make videos of Arab related history events ❤️❤️ specifically Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦
I ain't even from the US and even i now feel inspired to invade canada
Canadians don't have to be worried - Joe Biden doesn't know what Canada is at this point
31:01 I legitimately jumped at this scene thinking it's Morgan Freeman making a cameo, but the voice's pretty close nonetheless
Need the Vietnam war next. Please
YAyyyy another video, I love your videos brother
The ending is beautiful
Is it me or does the pig look like waddles from gravity falls?
Wow
As an American I think we keep forgetting that, while yes the Canadians are probably the kindest civilians in the world.... they on the other hand, do have a strong military
Amazing, simply amazing
I love how my "fan-sense" tells me that it's "sponsor time" and I keep watching because OverSimplified makes even ads look like a cool thing
« America, Pig Yeaaaah !!! » 😂🇺🇸🐷
lessssssssssssss gohhhhhhh
How do you find these things?  Love them!!!
Damn, I never thought Oversimplified would make a video about my home island. High quality vid, keep up the good work!
Finally the man the myth the legend!!!
Our king has returned
I pride myself on being rather well versed in history.  But today I learned something I did not know. Thanks again, man.
Yooooooooooo techno is that you
oink.
Return of the king
I say either the history of the Mongols or the Vietnam war
Dude chill out😂😂 don't provoke Biden, he might actually do it
I agree we should annex Canada. Introduce them to freedom.
Do the great Northern war
This was terrifying to see in my recommendation.
Amazing
This is the funniest presentation of idiot started war ive ever seen.
With every video, it gets more and more fun and high quality. That ending was specially funny. Thanks for the fun history lesson, Oversimplified!
Only God knows how have I missed over simplified for long
Make one on the Philippine Revolution
wait isnt the pig war the war between technoblade and a squid
This video left me confused should I be happy that oversimplified posted a new video or sad that i won't get a new one for like half a year
0:13 love that 'me'
it has been 6 months now he is back
IT WAS MY LAND GIVe IT BACK
Thank you so much for uploading !!
FINALLY THE BEST  TEACHER FINALLY UPLOADED A VIDEO!
Ok now Indian history please
Now I have to wait for 6 months for another video 😨😨😨😨😨😨
Woww this really takes Technoblade's Potato War to another level 😂😂
HES BACK
I’m pretty sure inciting a war is illegal
Hurray! Daddy's back!
hi oversimplified I love your videos! Great job creating another one!😁
I go to sleep today imagining Baynes' sweet kiss on Hornsby's lips.
Germany has a similar problem with the Netherlands, but nobody really care and weve agreements on that which work just perfectly sooooo ya💁‍♂️
U are the best history channel in the whole world.
20:01  Julian Assange reference? Also you forgot to mention the bears in the population count.
“Mole! Mole! Mole!!”
"That's a totally fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties - there's no way I'm ever going to agree to it!" - US Foreign Policy 1776 - Present
Last series (Napoleon) had the best intro ever. This has the best ending ever. The best content in YouTube :)
Please don't give Biden ideas.
Dady shreak 0
That is not how VPN works... Good video but that ad for NordVPN was just missleading garbage.
Back
You realize you just started a war on Canada man! What have you done?
Thank God
Thumbnail improving
Let's goooooooo
I don’t understand how the war of 1812 was a draw. America tried to expand their territory and Britain tried to keep theirs, and Britain did just that.
Guess who's back Back again Shady's back Tell a friend Guess who's back, guess who's back Guess who's back, guess who's back Guess who's back, guess who's back Guess who's back
:D
“I hear voices all the time” lol
9 hours ago
I am the only one worried about why Alaska is not the colors of Russia, but the whole video is gorgeous !!!
I never thought a major youtube channel would talk about the islands I grew up in.
Yo
I like a good joke but you really went overboard with the anachronisms this time...
7:57 that Shrek joke had me on the literal floor LOL
Final
With the long hiatus I was worried you wouldn't come back. Glad to see you're still going strong :D
So that's why the US has such an unsettling straight line border...
6:15 “Even six of them   those are 5
NO Effin Way!!!!! HES BACK THE KING IS BACK also could you make a video on British-India colonisation
The legend has returned!
The man comes back
I remember reading about this potential war, but never knew it was over a pig lol
love your accurate depiction of British parliament
Can't wait for this to be put in the history records as the start of the US CANADA war
YESSSSS
LESSS GGOOO
Why do you post after 6 months
Well that escalated quickly
The year is 2046 and Yes America Invaded Canada
You know. That ending is a real discussion I hear plenty from my fellow countrymen.   And its stupid
Fuck. I just realized I now have to wait another six months until the next oversimplified video.
That ending is beautiful! *tears^
Another banger and I suggest doing the Roman Empire or the American Indian wars for a video
"Lyman, if you spare my spare my life..."   i died
@31:05 was that Morgan freeman
Got any more Australian history???
Its ben 6 months
When the world needed him the most. He finally uploaded.
Imagine if civil war didn’t break out how much bigger America could have been
Please do an oversimplified video on coved 19 please love the vids
Finally
that rat at 3:42 is actually a gerbil  source: me and my channel- watch my videos of my beloved gerbils

After this ending, is this vid still available in America or do they have to use NordVPN to watch it?
vietnamwar  OverSimplified (Im from Vietnam )
Canada NEVER lost a WAR. NEVER
that last part is OS respond now that he has the power of no dislike
This man just keeps getting better and better
This guy could be one of the top voice actors in the world tbh, I love the bit when he just loses his shit in the end ranting
13:30 'The Americans felt that they were entitled...' Aahhh, some things never change.
Now it's finally time for  ' History of India ' Oversimplified
38:11 Biden....... IS COMING! (with the avengers)
Africa exist, european countries 1:55.
- Cracks open a cold one  - puts on a brand new oversimplified video - Let’s out an “uhhhhh”
This man just sacrificed his enrite Canadian audience for that ending, and i love it
THE RETURN OF THE KING!
Imagine if it invaded Canada lmfao
Fair trade, You take western BC and Ottawa For California and Washington DC, the cool part of Canada gets all those pesky red American areas like Texas  and Utah and Wyoming (rough draft)
Greatest man of all time nominee?
9:21
Why are they called Canadians? They don't live in Canadia. People in the U.S. aren't  Americians. Shouldn't they be Canadans?
Mate you know how to tell history 😂😂😂😂 that ending was too much
"the department of oregon" ....okay...please explain this, is that an old timey word for state, or an army regiment or what?
OverSimplified is like a solar eclipse it takes a long time to show but when it does its beautiful.
The return of the king
Could you talk about asain side i dont know like vietnam war
Mr oversemplified,  Thank you for this Little masterpiece and keep working like this! BUT  Where Is the video on the italian Risorgimento?
babe wake up oversimplified dropped
Me and my teammates to each other whenever we lose a rank game 32:31 - 32:36
Earl of jizzingham😂😂 i am dead
I liked how Oversimplified took his revenge in the ending... best ever ending in any youtube video
when he post his videos I see and hear his dedication in each video he makes my week ir sometimes even more
The Germans most likely gave it to the Americans since it took the British down a peg. They would have given it to the Americans if they delegation crapped their pants and spittled on their chin. The Russians Alaska to the Americans as opposed to Britain for the same reason.
19:32
This man is a legend
I love your vids oversimplified!!
The pig war can be cause by napoleonic war
My day would be good now 😭😭♥️
The voice acting and narration on this video was over-the-top. I hope it didn't strain your voice that much.  Excellent video, as always.
The w h a t
@4:10 USA in a nutshell LMAO
Dutlniv tioogattlyg
Were coming ya mooses
Use me as the new dislike botton (idk why would you dislike this video anyway)
Great timing, my APUSH teacher just mentioned this war yesterday lol
Amazing as usual 😁.
Plz do Vietnam war before moves onto another historical topic sir.
Could someone explain to me the “joke” with curves at the beginning of the video,usually i do get english jokes but since I’m not a native speaker i didn’t get this one
1:20 😂
Just amazing
Please make vietnam war
Bruh 1 million views in less than 8 hours holy shit oversimplified’s a goddamn legend.
Love your content bro
YOOOOOO
The last part was funny asf, great video. Worth the wait.
3:56 the suttle background noise " i hear voices all the time ".  i love the attention to detail of your videos
Jesus, that ending haha
um did any other pig died???
I have a lot of respect for Hornby, Baynes, and Scott, for their actions here. They were actually willing to take a step back, take a good hard look at this situation where a war was about to start over a pig, and say "This is fucking stupid. Let's just not."
Roman empire Roman empire money and views for the rise and fall of the Roman empire
Incredible what history brings out of people 😂🤣😂
that really spiralled in ways no one predicted at the end there
Damn
Can't wait for videos on the punic wars One day...
'Like rats or disease' - nothing truer has ever been spoken.
This entire video is oversimplified’s best work, each joke lands perfectly, the explanation of the time period is perfect and the joke at 4:04 had me dead 😂 also the animation quality has gone up! Love the content please keep it up!
Hey! Can you do a vid on monopolies? Like Rockefeller dude's Standard Oil Company and the Anti-Trust acts.
Why does the whole American independence thing feel like Britain being way more liberal to America than the rest of their colonies is this happened anywhere else the British would have cut them in half (I know this cuz I am indian and a lotta that stuff happened here) America really just got a free pass
Jolly good video! Been here since Hitler had his own demonitised vid!
I wanted to download this but i cant in 720p anymore? Like if u also have this problem
So what happens when you find gold in the oldie days do you just exchange it at the bank or what.
finally after 4 months
AMERICA WILL NEVER CONQUER CANADA!!!
finally new vid
This is the best
lesss goooo
gib vietnam war vidi pls
that ending tho lmao
Is that bit at the end a hint that the next episode about the U.S.'s failed annexations of Canada? Because there's a lot of people in the comments saying Canada would either let it happen or they couldn't stop us, and they clearly need an oversimplified* explanation of some of this country's most embarrassing military flops.
Thank you for another video!
he is aliiiiive
Not on trending?
I never realized you hate the United States
I can't stop laughing 13:29 🤣🤣🤣🤣
remember america last time you tried taking canada you went crying back home MUAHAHAHA
finallyyyy a new video
That John Bercow impression of the British parliament speaker is spot on!
Lyman.. shot his pig.  Bruuuuh💀💀💀💀💀
Nice to know Biden is gonna invade Canada lol.
Your videos always put a smile on my face. 👍
I am pretty sure the 5 Canadians watching this video have already disliked and unsubscribed... so, why not invade Canada?
at this rate we'd take biden over trudeau anytime
Finaly new video of oversimplified
Probably in no way similar to PlayStation's Hogs of War.
New oversimplified video and its about pigs
The legend is back
Yes, another video
your videous always blow up good job
That was the most coolest ending in a oversimplified video in history
Kim Jong hu is  impressed by your glorious speech my friend .
The PM in black mirror is obviously based on charles griffin
37:45 why is there a iraqi eagle on top the the American flag?😂
7:58 oversimplified pronouncing that sentence sounds shrek.
I love this guy
The last few minutes of that video tho. (In god we trust man)
If biden comes for the canadians  we're screwed. He even more incompetent than Harney.
FInally
Sometimes the titles are so ridiculous that I think oversimplified made it up
How in the fuck does this guy make history fun, what a legend
The british parliament looks like a dope place to hang...
I had a bad day with people cutting my line resulting me miss an body exam, had to go back tmr, thank u for making my day a lot better by uploading:)
I was literally just thinking a few hours before he posted this that it had been a while since he’d posted and then he drops this
He finally remembered his password
FINALLY
Wtf was the end of this lmao
Petition for Oversimplified to make a Vietnam War video
Am I seeing OS joining troops to invade canda?
i love his depiction of President Buchanan. The man almost single handedly lead to southern  succession and when he knew he royally screwed up, he was like, "meh, that's the next guy's problem"
Dammit, Canada! Look at what you did! You made OverSimplified to snap!
Love you bro
Comment
I liked the end there. Nice one 🤠
Heh, got a lot of OverSimplified videos recommended all of a sudden yesterday a few hours before this premiered. Guess YT saw it during processing and wanted to give it a push, because it knew this would be a banger.
where is anything about india??
yay a new oversimplified video
Bruh the background voices are so funny I swear. "And who spoke to god?" " I think it was Sharon's cat"😅
As a Canadian, best ending you've ever done
As a Canadian, I beg you to invade us, please
Aggressively anti American, incredibly uncharitable at the very least
As an American I can honestly say if Canada wanted to invade, nows the time. Sleepy Joe isn't going to stop you.
Do the Italian unification
LETS GOOOO
Your videos are the best out there
Pig war
Where war on terror
I though u died 🤣🤣🤣😂
Next video needs something to do with ireland
HE REMEMBERED HIS PASSWORD LETS GOOoOOOoOoOo
This narrative wasn't really "oversimplified". Plus I really think that the quality of humor and the visuals are kinda lowering. But hey, still a cool episode.
The thumbnail:  Those who don’t know: :) Those who know: :(
Der deutsche Kommentar den du suchst
You've made my entire day! Thanks for the upload good sir!
13:25 every time i get into an argument with my brother
I like how OverSimplified drew Buchanan.
Great! I go to watch some over simplified with my pet pig Ryan Reynolds and now he won't sleep. He is worried Biden is coming for his Candian Bacon thanks. You really need to put up a warning before this video might traumatize pigs.
God Bless America. Greatest country to have ever existed!
Canada:We have a pig. America:We have a potato. Canada:Let's have our pig eat that Potato America:No. you fool that will start a war.
More than half a year
At the end of the video, you went a little overboard with the yelling
I can't believe we reached a point where the pig war video is longer than the WW1 episodes combined.  Might need WW1 remastered, amirite?
Awww yea another history lesson! I know what we're watching class.
30 year war next?
Wow the ending was oddly terrifying
Just a pig?JUST A PIG?poor potato didn't even get mentioned 🙁
ggggggggg\
After many centuries finally!!!
amazing thanks
I love the work you put into your videos
The weirdest bit is realising this is all happening just months before the civil war.
Absolutely superb!  Had to wait a long time to watch a new video but it's well worth the wait.
Steamy McSteam face
finally 😎
Christmas comes early bois!!!
Holy fuck I was waiting for soooooooo damn long
I love that we never get any notice on an upload. It just drops.
Canadian Border Patrol a few hours later:  Sir, we're getting reports that millions of armed Americans are now crossing the border
That curtain bit was hilarious ><
British: Hey, that’s ours! Americans: *GUN* British: Ight imma head out
This event shall henceforth and forever be known as The Bay Of Pigs Invasion. Unless some other event should ever occur which more deserves the name, that is. But what are the chances of THAT happening?
2 million views in 8 hours. You know you have amazing content if that many people watch your content so quickly. I myself am one of those people. Keep making these amazing videos:)
This video could cause the war y'know
Really want this guy to do a vid on the South African war
can you do philippine history? that would be fun
What’s wrong with the racist who made this video? Why does he hate white people? For someone that’s making a history video he leaves out a lot of history
I live in Whatcom County thats so cool!
I’ll see y’all in another 6 months
🥲its bin so long, i was starting to think there would never be a new video.
That ending was everything I never knew I needed
da legend returns
I am so excited to see this up. I hadnot seen anything up for a while so about a week ago I started stalking your discord, got trolled a few times but I kept checking for your next release.
Mans out here getting 1.2 Million views in 9 hours lol
Can we have an afghan war oversimplified since its now independent
Christmas came early
wait taking to sheep:)))?
How is this not Trending O.O
Finnaly you posted
Brilliant!
Your backkk
The videos about Hitler are at this point the joke of the channel for being banned in so many countries and i love it
The Return of the King, quality over quantity
"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming, popped in their wagons and they hit the ground running, didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon, when they outnumbered brits 6-1"  Oh how I love OverSimplified.
After all these years, I still find Oversimplified the most consistently quality channel on the whole YouTube. Please, never stop, even if it takes half year to make a new video!
MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE!
50 years later:  Ah yes, the Over Simplified War, where America finally claimed Canada, I know it well.
U better watch out oversimplified us Canadians are a coming for you, sleep with both eyes open because we are watching you waiting to strike
Yes it was because they weren’t white, not because they’re weaker. *facepalm*
I think that this is the first time that oversimplified has had emotion in his voice
I think I speak for all when I say this “Dafuq?”
Bro really like your videos
Do a video on  decolonisation like of Britain or like 100 year war
I missed your videos
I love how this is in my hometown
He's the best history teacher I've ever had. Love you bro ❤️
Cool
FINALLY
8 hours, 1M views. Madlad fanbase. XD
Meow
Holy shit that ending lol
Minecraft pig
Less' go new oversimplified!
Day 1 of telling Oversimplified he should make a video about Yugoslav war
Damn dude, you've outdone yourself with this one!  Worth the wait.
Coming soon: the Oversimplified- Canadian War, oversimplified
Honestly just take our country at this point. Would be better for all us Canadians lol
War is declared.
Nice, time to bash the Anglo-Saxon on comments section
YOUVE DONE IT AGAIN BRO!!!
11:00 too good, too perfect
nice to see a oversimplified video haven't seen a new one a while
HE'S BACK
Little did they knew....      There was gonna be a tax for that.
As an american I dont think "being American so guns" is the insult you think it is............ freedom
epic episode man!!! thank you!
Brilliant as always! The war of Jenkins' ear might be a possible video.
You need to do Yugoslavian wars!
One day Canada will fly that red, white and blue Maple leaf flag I  Like
:D
The legend is back
NEW VIDEOO
hi, bye
Гамлен переводи живо!!!
Last time I was this Early Napoleon was still in Moscow

So happy for an upload can't wait for more videos!
This guy is the only living creature that can make a sponsor interesting
YESSS!!!!, new episode!!

HOLY CRAP OVERSIMPLIFIED PLUSHIE MOTHER I NEED YOUR CARD
I think the Canadians broke him
10 years later we waiting 🇮🇳 histroy
Last part is a truly Masterpiece.
anyone feels a sense of dejavu watching this video...
I like the voice of James Buchanan. That is amusing.
the last part🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best content ever!!  😄 gd job buddy 💚
That ending?  I did not see that coming
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAH BABY.
After the war General Pickett began collecting 'Forgotten Weapons' (a hobby which he still pursues).
I paid money just to avoid ads and yet it’s still here😡🤬
Hi
best series, and you dont even have to pay for netflix
This one is kinda boring
Make one on India vs pakistan
That moment when he cocks a flintlock muzzleloading rifle :p
Nice vid... But the ending?... I'm here like O-o... I better not mention I am Czech or else Biden might invade The Czech republic... OuUuUu NoOoOo
It sounds like Oversimplified is supporting war against peaceful nation, disgusting. I know some will defintley say it is a joke, but the way it was delivered certaintely doesn't present it that way
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeə
Next up: covering the US-Canadian war of 2022
As a Canadian: *Chuckles im in danger*
Hey
yay
Best content on youtube period. It's funny and educational
Didn't even watch it yet, but it already made my day.
I can't stop laughing at 31:03 also in ending part
Excellent video! Great storytelling, great gags, great visuals, and great visual gags!
So glad to see you’re still posting!!
He is back
I love this channel and how you narrate this with little bits of humour!!
finally
he's gone over top with the pausing in his voice in the more recent videos
The wait was worth it, everyone must agree.
Nice video! And a new video! IM FREAKING OUT! THABKS!
As soon as I saw this it give me flashback to the bucket wars
For real tho. Imagine if they did go to war? Imagine if Pickett died? Imagine how that would have affected the Civil war... there may have never even been a war. Or maybe it would have came long after Lincoln? Insane
ooh yes
Ending Imperalism of America
Dang I think those Canadian comments got to him
Canadians dont want no smoke
"And who was it who spoke to god?" "It was Billy, right?" "I thought it was Sharon's cat." "I hear voices all the time." I'm starting to question whether or not the Jews were right.
I love you, i mean you're the highlight of my day
the ending is so funny
37:15 my favorite part
As an Indigenous Australian I'm always saying stuff like "Man, these white people sure love XYZ" 😅😅
next- vietnam war
Finally...
Pls do "The history of the world, I guess" by Bill Wurtz in you style!
BIDENS COMING BABY
27:26 "Over the US border would look like this or like this."  I laugh way too hard on that one
that plushie looks more like a snowman to me.
xvcxvxcvbcbxcnyayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
First

OverSimplified is now a wanted man in Canada
The return of the king!
thanks for the new video, love you
One day Canada will take over the world and then you'll all be sorry.
That ending was bonkers
The history giga chad is back

He is back

Biden hahahahaahahahhahaahhaahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahaah.
9:09-9:24 Welcome to my childhood home, the Puget Sound.

7:57 a bit of rhythm in there OverSim
Yayhooooo!   He uploaded
That pig was evil
And he ends it in a Gosh darn hilarious manner 🤣
Teacher when someone didnt pay attention in the class 10:26
Is it weird to watch JonLevi and then watch Oversimplified?
Beautiful
Can you do video about croatian kingdom.... or you can’t do that
Hey can you please make a video about India Pakistan kashmir conflict
when is oversimplified vietnam war!
Oversimplified: Trouble sleeping? Need someone to snuggle? Me: Yes man! Desperately!! Oversimplified: Then why not snuggle me! Me: I did not see this coming.
i see what you did there, at 10:33,, with *jizz*ingham
LETS GOOO
Best over simplified video evrr
What in the world 37:15
Damn. I’ve finalt become one of those people that brag about having been here from the beginning. I mean, I haven’t. When I first found this channel it had like 5 to 7 videos and their most viewed video had about a million views, but it feels weird that they now get that much after only a few hours.
Worth the wait.
Oh my god, that sheep negotiation sequence was pure gold.
So...the motto of the story is "If you tell an American not to do something, that's the one thing they'll do"?
Best ending
31:00 Morgan Freeman imitation is genius. :D
Hi oversimplified can you make the great Mongolian invasion
Shit went 0 to 100 real fast at the end
lmfao the pig is morgan freeman
Italuan risorgiment
7:58 man, the guy sneak in an All Star joke 🤣🤣🤣
14:28 I see what you did there 😏
I can't wait for the romoured W.A.R releases U.S.-Russia war U.S.-Canada war U.S.-Afganistan war U.S.-China war And the dlc- North VS South,Korea edition
waiting for this for so long
finnaly new vid
That was the best Oversimplified ending ever😂
Another OverSimplied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT MORE OVER SIMPLIFIED
At last.... it's been years 🥲
15:00
Your back doing these videos
Wouldn’t be good if you Americans invaded us during the winter
Finally after 6 months , British Canada, independent USA  ok ok
People who were expecting a video about Vietnam wars 🤣🤣still happy to see a video from oversimplified.
Opened YouTube to fall asleep and found this. Guess I’m not sleeping for another ~40 mins
Bad piggies mement
so glad that u upload
I've waited 2-no 500 years for this
I am not surprised that Britain and America almost went to war because of a pig also you should do the War of 1812 next and keep up the good work
If it is the Yankee heritage to manifest destiny it is mine as a Canadian to burn your white house down. We are coming back down south with all the syrup you can chug, all the healthcare you can afford and all the sterotypes to shake a stick at.
Well that was fun, see you next summer lads
That last part made me proud to be American… even thought I’m an Australian with no American heritage at all.
I frikin love oversimplified. His videos are amazing. It is very understandable why it takes a while for a new one. It is very worth it. Keep on going!!!!!
there are 2 kinds of history people, the boring ones and people like oversimplified
Yes...Yes...YES!!!
over 1 mill views in 8 hrs lol
He's back
gues who's back!
It’s 1: 23 am and I’m watching oversimplified… everything is fine
That's gonna be A LOT of new memes :D love scenes with pig, that collector knowing sheep language and Scott attacking Harney
When the quiet kid takes up an animation course in skillshare
British: BUCHANAN! Buchanan: *girly noises*  Also Harney: They made me cry like a little girl - no they made me cry like a BIG girl!
I can't think of anything worse that could happen to the citizens of a social democracy than becoming part of America.
I fucking love this
Can you make a STAR WAR(s) series because I wanna watch it but it’s a lot of movies, too complex because of the chronology thing, and I don’t know where to begin.
7:58 he just sung a verse to that one shrek song i forgot what it was called
Let me guess, the next video is about "the only war in the US soil"?
YESSIR
His voice acting is so good now. I love how he played Lyman Cutler.
Regarding your portrayal of James Douglas.  You've just installed my entire race of people. But yes.
This was more boring, time wasting and distracting than an actual history lesson, I wish the dislike button still worked 😒👎
LETS GO
I had to learn about this in my state history class cor Washington State twice Middle school and College
The pig is not dead. It evacuated to Argentina.
Æ
I need a plushie of the pig to put in my patrol vehicle Stat
He is back!
could u do on the indian freedom revolution? pls
When the world needed him, he returned.  Also, not again, Benjy.....
Pito
Can you maybe make a video about the 80 year war
Make a video The Rise Mongol empire
Man I just recently learnt this in history class
Subcontinent history Wen ?
ITS PRONOUNCED BARKSHIRE!!!
peeg
HES BACK OMG
But the americans keep coming and they dont hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running 7:55
I wasn't expecting this.  A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
A 6 month worth while wait
next czech legioíns pweeese
nice
Spuddy nooooooo
You got the whole squad standing
India please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
that last part lol
OMG
Okay but is no one gonna talk about the Morgan Freeman voice for the pig at 31:04?
3 4 videos per year worth it
Mad lad
Yessssssssss
The legend is back!
"The brits keep coming and they don't stop coming, Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running. Didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon..." i see what you did there...
You should do he Irish famine
I would very much like to see an Oversimplified video on the Indian Freedom Struggle
A war about your mom
I told my teachers about you, now whole school is going to your channel
I love all of your videos
That last part though. But Biden won't do anything. He's done damage to his own country, and looking at other videos of yours, is starting to look a lot like the Tsar, or the French King. We all know what happened there
Finally a  OverSimplefied :D
Am dying over the end XD
So Pickett was a fuck up for the USA and the Confederacy? 😭
As someone from Vancouver BC I find this incredibly fascinating until I get the the end where I become very scared
18:44 OMG the dramatic pause for effect 😂😂😂😂
finally
finally uploaded!
That ending lol
Border Issues in year 80's: "Straight line? Yep straight line".
Is this all forgotten before the world wars (WW1) (WW2)
33:28 Satisfying
WOOOO YEAH BABY THATS EHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Let’s gooooo
I just realized that the Nord VPN character has their logo for his head and does NOT just have blue anime hair for some reason
Please do the history of isreal and Palestine.  I'd say good lick but you successfully covered the 3 kingdoms so i beleive in you.
5:19 and there's no WAY I'M EVER GOING TO AGREE TO IT got me
Ayy new episode
The pig being one of the few things with legs is so creepy
great vid love em all , when's Vietnam coming
Dude….I have never laughed and learnt so hard and much thanks to a single youtube video in years…thank you for making this awesome content. Amazing work and I can’t wait to see what else is coming!
You were dead for years
Lmao, only Americans think the War of 1812 was a draw. The war started because America wanted to subjugate Canada. The UK wanted to defend Canada. War ended with Canada still free. The UK won.
It might just be because it's easier to draw, but in my heart this pig will always be a Gravity Falls reference <3
In a farm far far away….
The fact that america nearly went to war over shooting a pig is the most violently American thing I’ve heard
Oh dear god not the Canadians. THEYRE SO NICE
This is the quality content for which I pay my internet bill.
The best ending ever
my friends and I called the two guys making borders straight as: Phil and Frank
Oversimplified gave away our plans to invade Canada in order to get their Healthcare, poutine, and maple syrup 🥲
sahsahmwau
YES NEW VIDEO
leave it to biden to do something as stupid as invading canada.
I don't find anything wrong with him saying to Canada, but I found it(not American or Canadian) mediocre funny... I guess...?
10:23 Such an accurate representation of parliament
Yessssss finally after a few months of watching oversimplified daily, new vid
Fs in chat for the pig
But without Canada American would no longer own a hat
Made my day :D
Bro that ending caught me off guard
Finally a new video
you should do the new zealand wars in the mini wars series it about the british invading new zealand
That ending was the funniest shit I've seen in a while
I must say, you make a very convincing case at the end there.
World its not about USA dude. Stop this nonsense ideas. Make a video about Russian civil war, Vienam war.
new vid pog
This was just brilliant! I hope this is shown in the public education system! These videos are educational and entertaining
i live in Vietnam where 24 us dollars = 1m VND
"Straight line? Straight line ."  Best lines ever!
That ending justified the long production time
I hate Canada
It’s about time
New video let’s go
Just awesome
Very great video! I would really want to see you do the german unification and/or the franco prussian war :p
Let's be honest. If America invades Canada it will be over in a week and the only response the world will give is "wait, why?"
Amazing as always
It’s confirmed: Harney is Drake’s ancestor
Shoot me, Lyman! Shoot me, Lyman!
10:23 as a Brit, I can confirm this is how our parliament works
9:19 Bathroom 20:35 Dog 27:32 Realizing How Stupid This Is 33:28 Dad Beats Son
Youre videos are the shiz. I wish you made videos everyday. YOU ROCK
He's back he's back !!!
Ooo, finally new vid
Oversimplified, that ending made my day.
I though this would veiteam war
*Insert technoblade reference*
I got so excited to see you've uploaded, always loved your content. much love from Finland !
Finally.
37:17 My patriotism is going through the roof
No you’re not right The British are coming for vengeance
I never thought I’d see a youtube historian declare war on Canada but here we are
If the US went to war with the Brits, they will be annihilated since they will be fighting the Confederates also. The British might even allied with the Confederates and slavery would still be legal in 2021. Damn i wish that happened. I want my own human as a pet...
Yay a new video
I am waiting 6months for new Upload and now here it is very worth it to wait
37:00 here is where the ending begins
His comedy is getting better by the second   I'm going to buy cute little plushie now
Britain: *shoos away some religious fanatics* Those religious fanatics: *find a new piece of land* now we are the God's chosen ones and we shall rule the world  And 200 years later they're still like that
Every video becomes another reason I would never dream of unsubscribing to this channel!!
When the world needed him most, he vanished. 100 years past and recommended and I found a new video, one named "The Pig War - OverSimplified". There are still many more to come, but I believe, "The Pig War" can save my boredom.
I dont think any of us expected the Pig War, but i guess we have to accept it lol
Popped a million views within 10 hours
How about Biden just take over the entire north america
The Great War of the 19th century...
You don't talk enough about the Netherlands! (We also want an awsome ending)
Declaration of war?😂
Now you FORGOT ABOUT 7 years war
That ending is amazing
These videos just keep getting better and better. 100000/10 I recommend to everyone
YEEES HE BACC
U.S. towards Canada - "Ah our friendly peaceful Northern neighbors, their vast clean wilderness, their multi culture nation, their children playing in their towns, what a lovely day to be alive!"  *Oversimplify creates this video*  U.S. towards Canada - "COMMENCE WITH WAR PLAN RED!"
Oversimplified kinda lost his mind at the end there i'm not gonna lie
“History doesn’t tell but like to think they did” the greatest quote known to man
I'm actaully pumped about the maple syrup
Oversimplified goated from day 1
The ending was chaotically fantastic
This dude needs to be the most subed person on yt. So great
I think the guy go for war against canada
It's coming home!!!
Hands-down you have the best ad reads I’ve ever seen😂😂❤️
Ceterum censeo Canada esse delendam
Ian McCollum occupies san Juan
The US Invasion of Canada - July 2034 on the Oversimplified channel
"Briddish" lol
I don’t know if sleepy Joe Could even go to the bathroom by himself.
yay
10:27 why does that seem like something that would happen today
this is so funny
Finally, a new Oversimplified video. Thanks man.
I watched the last 1:30 like 10 times lmao had me rolling literally
I can't stop laughing at the end lol
Can you do six day war ?
Aww what?! I thought it would be a M4 assault rifle
oink.
BTFO Yankee Propaganda Canada will stand! love from Vancouver  really nice to see my area referenced :D
Oversimplified is just shitposting with history
i thought this was related to @Technoblade ...
I sail around the San Juan Islands in the summer all the time! This is cool for me
"I've seen irish famines with more potatos then this farm" -Technoblade
YEEEEEESSS
Honestly why not?🤨😂😂
HE'S ALIVE
man.   now you just need to do that one time when Greece invaded Bulgary over the dog that ran the wrong direction.   Google War of Stray Dog 1925 or Incident at Petrich
You know it's a good day when oversimplified uploads a 30 minute video
When the world needed him the most he returned.
1:19 "I would worry about ur curve" 0:47 "I didn't say the were white" hhhmmmis that racism I smell but because he didn't mean it's funny
I watched a fresh Oversimplified video instead of studying for my finals.            This enraged my professors, who punished me severely.
Am I the only one who thinks of star wars when looking at the image of the video?
If the USA invaded Canada wouldn't NATO be forced to go against the USA as well as the Commonwealth
Well that ending went from 0-100 Very F***ing quick, great video
*someone made a reasonable proposal*  America: "That would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interest of both parties... AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M EVER GONNA AGREE TO IT!"
Let’s go new oversimplified video!!
That ending, lol
What was that ending for god sake
I hate it when I have to wait 7 months for this channel to post a new content, but I believe on quality over quantity. This is definitely worth the wait.
Finally after 5 months lmao
Straight line? Straight line.😂😂😂😂
We the American people don't want Justin Bieber as a US citizen so we won't be annexing Canada.
Eek new episode!
Biden's Coming babyyyyyy
I accidentally came across this while looking for other history videos. Anyway this is great and i like how there is more memes and the animation is getting better
YESSSS
27:27 "Weather the US-Canada border looked like this or this"  Really happy to see the difference.
The end was a slice of perfection 🥰 💞 👌 we attack at dawn!!...I mean...nothing.. yes Canadians in the comments  nothing is happing relax and enjoy hockey.  nevermind the build up of Abrams tanks and monster trucks and people in football pads nothing abnormal at all. I PROMISE!!

Damn, most emotion in an Oversimplified video ever.
A good day when oversimplified posts

I'm a simple man. I see oversimplified, I click

Ahhh....Murica doing Murica things. Have a good idea? HELL NAAHHH!!!! I AIN'T GONNA THINK?!?! PEW PEW
Do the Vietnam war next or the Afghan war
19 minutes was the funny one to me also you can invade canada in iron assualt play roblox
All I learned from this video is don’t be compromising and don’t be fair. Just be a greedy argumentative ass until you got what you want and more.
Ideas:  Vietnam War War of the Roses Mongol Conquests 100 Years War 30 Years War Indian Revolution Canadian Revolution Korean War Balkan Wars Crimean War Mexican Revolution
New oversimplified content!! I'll watch it on the weekend with a beer in hand. This is my weekend treat.  I'll just give it a like now though because, you know... it's oversimplified.
Wow amazing just amazing
still classic as ever
only americans call it a draw, anyone with common sense calls it their first loss
I'm always excited seeing your videos you make learning interesting and fun, keep up the good work mate
Please make a video on 7 years war there are no good videos about it on YouTube
Enjoyed as always!! Ending was terrifying and the animation has improved so much. 🐖
love this
Let’s goo your back!
Okay, so I literally just watched the black mirror episode where the prime minister had to f*ck a pig. So the random pig romance in this video was very unhelpful in getting that whole experience out of my mind 😂
Great video, pls make a video about the eigthy years war or the Anglo-Dutch sea wars.
Not like the British to go to war over a non essential island thousands of miles away :p
Shit gets down when he uploads a vid
I love oversimplified so much
I’ve lived in BC all my life and I didn’t know any of this.
FINALLY!
Way out of line in the end…
Where you been for 6 months
Racist mother f***s lol
Yeeeessssss
FINNALY YEY
Add north North American to the US OF A
Over a PIG
The plushie looks like a depressed snow man
AFTER 6 MONTHS OF DOING A PLUSHY HE DECIDED TO MAKE A VIDEO YAAAAAAY
Bro are you ok and Canada lost only 1 war that you drag them in
These videos are getting more and more absurd, and it's amazing
Now imagine the end of this video causing a war between America and Canada.
Also love the ending
🤣🤣🤣
Yoo, Oversimplified's back
7:57 all star lyrics
I want a Nord VPN character pin now!
USA USA USA USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
It’s hereeee
this is amazing he finally uploaded the historians will record this as one of the greatest moments in history
The Pig War was a confrontation in 1859 between the United States and the United Kingdom over the British–U.S. border in the San Juan Islands, between Vancouver Island (present-day Canada) and the State of Washington. The Pig War, so called because it was triggered by the shooting of a pig, is also called the Pig Episode, the Pig and Potato War, the San Juan Boundary Dispute and the Northwestern Boundary Dispute. Despite being referred to as a war, there were no casualties on either side.
One of my new favorites mostly because of the ending
One day can you do ‘the British empire’ and ‘the Roman Empire’
Canadians: You don’t ever talk about us! Oversimplified: I will once we invade you Canadians: That would  be a fair compromise that would satisfy both parties and I will not AGREE WITH IT!
Would you look at that, another War not happening because a Captain said "Fuck this"
Ok so hear me out... I have thought long and hard about this. What if we convinced the Quebecois to declare independence. In the chaos, America would be a great alternative. Even if we don't take the whole thing... We can still get a little nibble. Think of all the oil in Alberta... We could suck the ground dry and unify there dairy laws to improve the quality of life for everyone in north America except for the Quebecois and the Mexicans, but they don't speak English so that's not a huge loss.
Honestly... A confederation of north American states would be cool.  Autonomous nations/states United under a singular joint economic sphere to rival the rising alliances in Europe and Asia.   Could call it The North American Union, or confederation of North American states.  We are the "new" lands of the world and share a common story of colonial powers overruling us before we gained our independency from those colonial powers.  Besides. With the economic potential of Canada, Mexico, and the United States- jobs could remain in North America and a sense of autarky be instilled.  We would be able to in times of need unify military force from every nation in the confederation and form a defensive line from coast to coast.  Politically of course it could be more independent to localities in terms of each nation.  America it's president Canada it's PM, and likewise across all members- but a joint congress on matters of the supernation could be formed and address important things concerning the economy and military/emergening issues.  Things on the social level would remain in the hands of local administration.  (Honestly though as a constitutionalist with libertarian views I feel that on a social scale freedom for all- barring the consequences of crimes of society of course.  This has been a long one.  But I may draft something later about this.  I know other people have theorized this but I feel that should it ever be achieved, North America as a whole would be able to prosper and thrive for years to come.
YAYYY HES BACK im just realised as well the pig in the thumbnail looks like palpatine once i saw that i just started laughin
This is the best thing I've ever watched
But weren’t those Americans originally British? So when they had to jointly occupy the western land didn’t they have most things in common?
HE UPLOADED…. YESSSS
Wow I now understand USA obsession with Israel, similar tactics lol.
OMG THANKS I BEEN WAITING FOR 6 MONTHS
finally he posted a Video.
gotta love that dry delivery of jokes. Lol
This is a great way to start my morning
3:53 I thought it was Sherman’s cat too
You make life suck less. Thank you.
I would rather kill myself then be annexed

When I saw "Pig War", I got my hopes up for the Hatfields and McCoy's lmao  Awesome video bro, always entertaining, always educational

Can you make a video about Sweden
I love how he brought Charlie Hopkinson to do the voice of the pig.

I thought this was a video about Technoblade when I saw that title ;p
So, for the record, it took the maple syrup line for my Canadian girlfriend to shout NOOOOO
As a Minnesotan I finally find out how that northern point came to be.  Did you just go Dr. Suss on us?   This was defiantly the funniest one you've done so far.
I missed you
If I become a social studies teacher I will play this if I don’t feel like teaching
Can you make one on british colnialism of India ?
Finally
Watched it live! So naturually had to rewatch it again :).
I love how the thumbnail of this video is star wars reference
33:34 is undoubtedly the best part of the entire video.
You make a very compelling argument for Canadian invasion and after that ending how can I say no?
I laughed out loud multiple times during this video 😂
btw Canada has Britain for war
can you make a video on the vietnam war
Excellent work, as always.
Heyyyy you're back!!!!!
Sometimes,idiocy made history
Me 6 months later waiting for a new Oversimplified video: "Yes! Another Oversimplified video!"
YEEEEEES a new video thank you
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VID LETS GOOOOOO!!
I 100% support a shooting war with Canada 👍🏻
Even though this videos only been up for 7 hours it deserves more viewes and likes! (Currently  1M, likes 144k) Oversimplified is UNDERRATED.   his story telling ability is unmatched! Thank you Oversimplified for making learning about history an enjoyable and exciting experience. Thanks for helping me understand so many historical events... I'm dyslexic so normally reading  through doesn't really work for me. I don't normally write comments... but I wanted to take the time to thank you. If you're reading this, just know YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
i wasn't gonna have a breakfast, but now i got something good to watch, i'm definitely having a good breakfast.  Thank you OverSimplified for thinking about my health.
As a Canadian, seeing that photo of Gretzky with American flags almost made me puke
A million views in 8 hours jeeeesus
i love you so much but for the love of god please upload more, i cant keep waiting half a year to enjoy one of my favorite youtube channels
Honestly, I have to give a lot of respect to the Captain of the navy for not starting the war. It really was a stupid reason to go to war 😂
This is the same Pickett that agreed to a charge across a mile and a half of open ground under long distance artillery and the canister and rifle fire? Essentially destroying his entire division? Same idiot yeah?
Finally!!! ❤️🥳
Gone are the days we are deprived of your video.
This is by far the best video on youtube this month!
"Whoa whoa whoa! I didn't say they were _white_ people!" Ah yes, the statement that has caused far to many tragedies throughout history and, many, _many_ years after the fact, causing hindsight-induced face palms.
Wow f@%#
What an amazing ending from a Canadian 🤣🤣🤣
*I happen to like BOTH, Baked Potatoes AND Bacon. And I'm willing to fight BOTH, the U.S and Canada, SIMULTANEOUSLY for those islands. "Put up your DUKES"!!*
Poor spuddy he got eaten by a pig
Can you make video about joseon vs japan war in 16th century
“Oversimplified is more popular than the kardashians!”- John Lennon, maybe.
He back
As someone who grew up in Seattle and lives in Whatcom County, it's cool to see this weird local thing get this kind of a masterpiece.
The ending totally wasn't over the top... :-)
Love your content
FUUUUG I NEED THAT PLUSHIE!!!!!
"Depicting the "Jack" upside down again ?" What mindless effrontery.
4:13 ROFL. As always your videos brighten my day. also either i'm blind but where is the merch link. I NEED THAT PLUSH IN MY LIFE
I must say the pig was very cute
"Which one of us was it that spoke to God?" Why, it was the all-American prophet Joseph Smith, of course!

I absolutely look forward to each and every one of your uploads, merry christmas dude! Also the vietnam reference istg
16:02 an AK?! This is blasphemy. Where is his god blessed M16 rifle.
So, the islands definitely belonged too America.
Vietnam is still open…
Great to see the legend with his legendary contents once again. Always worth the wait 🥰
Which Star Wars poster is the thumbnail trying to parody? I can’t tell
Does anyone felt that he sounded like leloch from code geass anime at the end
Americans keep coming, they  don't coming Hopped in their wagon, and they hit the ground running Gem of a 2 liner!!

Internet Historian has better adreads, but your segways into them are smooth as silk

How to disrespect America :  1. Steal a flagpole.
A new video, I need to watch
Bro your acting has gotten so much better over the years, this is hilarious. "BIDEN'S COMING, BABY" broke me.
Legend says, Peter Griffin's great great great grandfather is Charles Griffin.
I hope oversimplifies makes the thumbnail into a poster I would buy that real quick
Bidens commin baby  -oversimplified Dec 6th, 2021

I have watched u for ages i remember when you only had the football war ww1 and ww2 on your channel
LETS GOOO
Welcome back OS.  .
Why i dont skip during nordvpn advertisrment boggles my mind.
Only liked the video for the final rant
10:23 Thanks for that very accurate depiction of British parliament. I’m glad to have some proper representation of my country
Great content as always. Still waiting for Vietnam War.
As someone that lives on Vancouver Island I was always wondering if any of our antics would make it into your vids, kinda surprised this topped us literally blowing up an under water Mountain
Finally another oversimplified video
Whoo hoo finally!
I love these videos they’re funny easy to understand and did I mention funny
Daaammnn he's back

Finally, A reason to countine living
Well i didnt expect that ending
YES FINNALLY
“Well that would be a completely fair compromise that would protect the interests of both parties, and there’s no way I’m ever gonna agree to it!” - Modern politics in a nutshell
Oversimplified really said "I'll be back"
Omg
Holy shit the last part was good.
Finally a new vid
Where were you? I missed you....
Finally your back after months .... Nice videos
Why does James dugless look like frank murphy from f is for family

Ah... Oversimplified My early Christmas present
‘’Lyman… shot the pig.’’   America has declared war on us!
Damn.. USA :)
I love the scenery of native owned America, it seemed like such a beautiful place
I can tell he sure had a god damn good time recording this with all those personalities he got to play with. By far your best video yet
At 4:15 basically summed up America in 2021.
CAN YOU PLEASE POST VIDEOS MORE FREQUENTLY
AHH! OVERSIMPLIFIED HAS POSTED A NEW VIDEO!!!!
i dont even know sht about this war but i know its good because its made by OverSimplified
And now the gut wrenching wait starts for next video
This is sooo good!, One of the best channels on Youtube!
7:15 YouTube: Wait, that's illegal.
18:37 did he just pump a double barrel shotgun?
Today I watched oversimplified turn into the US analog for the Spiffing Brit. Also don't worry Canada, Biden will probably get lost and confused and declare war on Narnia instead.
YOU’RE BACK!!!
Vid idea:bosnian war
canada: im sorry you started a war here's our country. America: but we want war!!! canada: ok here is all our weapons.  America: never mind its not fun without a fight.           and that kids is how canada won the war
Best video ever!!!😂
He just sacrificed all his Canadian audience just for that ending, what a legend.
A NEW VIDEO!!!!!
AYO! Vancouver Island hillbilly’s get some recognition!
He came back y'all!!😄😄😄
Can you please do a video about the Ottoman Empire
Damn my boy oversimplified really hates canada
What a glorious day! OverSimplified has finally uploaded a video again
15:27 I know history tends to repeat itself but… Falklands War anyone?
7 hours ago?  970k-ish views😲.  Great stuff!!
Neat
I think this had more hype than Spiderman-NWH.
bruh the all star reference lol
Canada is a state of the US.
15:58 US : the most US thing to do is not to agree also US : pulls out an AK-47
As a Canadian I loved the history lesson. I was actually on Vancouver Island a month ago and wondered how they figured all that out lol
As a Canadian I can say. We won motherf*****s
When Vietnam war
You should do the Mexican American war
That end bit got a little weird
HE'S NOT DEAD ???
Haha picket - pickets charge.
This video took me by surprise
return of the king
Make a video about the Greek revolution of 1821, please!!!!!!!🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
This is the best one so far
BUT THE AMERICANS KEEP COMING AND THEY  DON'T STOP COMING HOP IN THE WAGONS AND THEY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING  NOBLE PRIZE FOR LITERATURE GOES TO OVERSIMPLIFIED
Imagine americe starts a war to occupy canada after this video
38 minutes of oversimplified video......hell yeah!!
Beware, Canada!
This. Was. Awesome.
War of 1812 a draw? You did say something about The White House being burned. Right? 😁
38 MINUTES LONG????? that 6 month wait MIGHT be worth it
Please do Indian Independence next
The ending should be the US military ad
Omg finally a new video!
...the only casualty in this war was Spuddy and The Pig...🐽which means only two casualty in this war*
If this is all I get for christmas I'm satisfied
I’m sold on the ending      It’s manifest destiny time!
bro that pig sounded like morgan freeman
I never thought a declaration of war could be funny, until that ending.
Pure masterpiece
Honestly I was just waiting for Nord VPN
You can see the immense increase in quality every video, I was blown away by how good this was.
Oversimplified posts a video and I click instantly. Simple
You dont talk about India enough
Well that was disappointing woke garbage.
Yesssss new oversimplified vid
Hey can you keep making videos
Do Apartheid or something else because I NEED MORE THAN YOU THINK!?
Wow, a war with the funniest name yet! This was a very interesting video! Could you try a video about south asian history? Since those countries aren't very talked about!

OVERSIMPLIFIED IT THE GREATEST HISTORY TEACHER I LEARN FROM
Biden coming baby 😂😂😂
This channel has me exited for history. A subject that normally  I couldn't care less about
–Hmm... Straight lines? =Straight lines 🤝
How about you do one on the yugoslav  wars
angry birds star wars 2 refrence.
Out of all the videos theyve done this one seems the most political. And it feels like they had some sort of woke motive or something behind it.
After 6 months, the Legend has returns
Please do Korean History like Joseon dynasty, three kingdoms of Korea and more! :)
Man it’s been so many years and Oversimplified is still making great content
We shall salute the fallen pig

The King Has Returned.
babe wake up new over simplified just dropped
HE'S BACK! Man this video was awesome!!
This whole video(especially the end)was made in heaven (pun intended)
Yes, let's invade Canada 🇨🇦
Invade Canada?  There are only like 3 airports in the whole country, and nobody wears beaver hats anymore.
I was laughing my ass off when he mentioned montreal, he should’ve mentioned joe biden eating poutine on the 4th of july
Maybe you could do like fiction wars or stories.
Thank goodness, you're back. I Missed you man. Love from DR Congo
Trust the Germans to screw over the English
WEMISS YOU
Great thumbnail
Christmas came early
He has returned!
BUCHANAN!
HE’SSSSS BACKK
great work!
Aah. Finally the wait is over. But now I have to wait again for the next video..... ... ... ... Uncool.
Oversimplified posting a new video? It really is Christmas!
27:30 I had to pause to get my laugh
7 hrs 15000 comments and 1 million views wow
That all star bit 7:57 made me laugh more than it should have
Finally a new video!
xqcL
Ngl I thought oversimplified was Canadian
Finally I love your all video
Finally a new vid!!
Why do I hear British empire boss music coming back long with German
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
Bruhh we need vietnam war
Well another 6 months to wait for a new video
17:46 squidkid during the great potato war
bold way to end it. i like it
lets go he uploaded!
I legit thought that this was an old video. And then I saw the thumbnail.
Canada: exists Oversimplified: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
This guy has amazing ways of advertising
Babe get up, Oversimplified posted
You know it’s going to be a good day when oversimplified uploads a new video
37:15 someone give Oversimplified guy a chill pill and some Canadian beer
I’ve been convinced. Invade Canada. They have it coming.
Oversimplified rlly makes everyone's day
All the Americans of the 19th century did was what the Spanish, English, and French  had been doing for centuries before them (and alongside them) and the Romans for centuries before that.  A big deal is always made of the American treatment of the Indians but I guess everyone just wants to ignore things like the Anglo-Zulu, Anglo-Egyptian, Franco-Hova, and well over two dozen other wars of conquest and subjugation.  Still, that scene of the settler stepping outside and mowing down buffaloes while laying down train tracks and building McDonalds was hilarious.  This is now the best Oversimplified ever.
This one went for it.
Best ending ever😂
I don't know if you produce these alone or with a team but it's a lone you should hire a team to make more videos, faster! Me and thousands of others would pay dearly for that! You're a genius!
Canadians are de facto Americans anyway, so no invasions are needed! 🤣🤣🤣
I’m sorry oversimplified we just learned about this a few days ago and today in 5th grade social studies you were late :(
WE want a video on Our Soviet Union
0:10 😂
I fucking love this channel
It feels weird to watch an oversimplified video and not have every line memorised
lessss gooooo
I like the star wars type thumbnail! Keep up the work oversimplified!
loved the last bit
hearing about the SJI on a big yt channel is so cool!!
7:58 can we all agree that was the smoothest transition and the sneakiest Easter egg we’ve ever seen in his channel.
Was not ready for the ending
I hope all us Canadians love that ending as much as it deserves!
7 hours and already 146k likes
*Honey wake up, new Oversimplified video just dropped*
I was about to tell him about India but I guess I won't. (That awesome end.)  And yes he talked about Red Indians of America not South Asia.
If I would have a choice of listing to one thing for my whole entire life it would be the end about manifest destiny
Please Make A Video On The British Rule In India! I'm Your Biggest Fan From India! 🇮🇳
37:11 I’ve been saying this for years
WW3 RUSSIA-UKRAINE IS ON ITS WAY, BOYS.
As a Canadian I must say … I’m scared

Can I just say that is by far the best ending ever
30:47 when they pump a flintlock rifle
5:26 "They both agreed to jointly occupy the Northwestern Territory" FFS isn't that like the 3rd or 4th Northwest/Northwestern territory so far on this continent?
I love the "I hear voices all the time" at 3:53
hey afterrr sooomany days a new video
Omg youre back
The ending was amazing
That ending is definitely a step up. Love that you let loose that much there to just rant about Canada even though it had very little to do with the video lmfao. Great stuff 😂😂😂
The voice of the pig, brilliant
Oversimplified is proof that quality is far superior to quantity.  I think everyone appreciates the shear amount of effort and devotion each segment takes.  Keep up the amazing work!!!!
We could just burn down your White House again
haha, so many problems could have been solved if they got the internet, I'm so grateful that Ipeople can sent and receive info quickly these days.
And what about the Boxer Rebellion?
Ahhhhh
What about the Balkan wars?
YES is this the last video of the year?
10:23 as a British person I can confirm that this is a completely accurate depiction of parliament
Fun vid but wheres Vietnam war I need it for school
The return of the king
Never in a million years I would think that there is a star wars series on pig wars
Please do the chinese civil war next
aye burh, idk what you did, but i saw a huge jump in production quality. Amazing
Oversimplified I'm from Iraq and I really want that you make a video at the Iraq war

Yay.
Amazing content as usual! 👍👍

Omg a new videooo. I love this channel
This man found a way to hype me up to invade Canada, the us government needs to hire him to make propaganda reels.
Generals gathered in their masses...
The Amerikan history suks ou have 100 years peasful
My favorite episode so far, so hilarious and informative 🤣🤣
Can you do one about the winter war
There was another land dispute between Texas and Chihuahua caused by the natural fluctuation of the Rio Grande that lasted over 100 years and resulted in an assassination attempt on both President Taft and Diaz... 😬 Borders... Always much clear on paper l 🤣
Brilliant eh?
As someone who is British and likes British politics and law, the depiction of Parliament and more precisely the speaker of the house… Quality! 😂
The Legend is back💖👍
Lol I was just thinking you should do a video on this
nordvpn is actually a part of history
who else went hype when they saw new vid
Totally wasn't sure if that was actually Morgan Freeman's voice or not! You guys should really check out Charlie Hopkinson. He has some great stuff.
Best momoents 37:08
Love the video let’s invade Canada
Finally a new video
Ending of the video was completely out of box. I hope Canadians don't get offended.
wtf is going on with the ending XD
Damn... American upload times
I was thinking about you yesterday too
Noice
Not if we invade first
bro... what?
Maybe you could make a video about the war between Netherlands and Spain that lasted for 80 years?
Can you make a video about the war that broke Yugoslavia apart
Can you make a video about the war that broke Yugoslavia apart
Can you make a video about the war that broke Yugoslavia apart
Can you make a video about the war that broke Yugoslavia apart
Yes there’s finally a new one!!
Such a delay between videos? Dude, uncool. The fact that it took so long to get good quality videos? Dude, cool! Worth the wait. ABSOLUTELY COOL!

The best ending segment ever

it's been ages
Yes u r back
At last....was waiting for your video for such along time..great work!!!Keep it up.
After all these years finally the day came
I had a weird feeling an OverSimplified video would come out today... :D
Oversimplified, the only youtuber to post only twice a year and still have millions of subscribers..
10:23 order. ORDARRRR. Shut Up John Bercow approves
I feel as if a standing ovation is deserved. To this day and likely forever fourth, I'd ever laughed so hard. Banger, after banger, joke after joke. The pig war, with its amazing thumbnail and animations, has made it's history for its self as one of the best simple history videos yet! I can't wait to see what you come up with next. Franco-German war? India's break from Britain? I'm all too excited! Bravo sir, bravo.
One of the best Oversimplified videos ever and I’ve watched all the rest multiple times and I’m only halfway through 🤩
(-=
Another gem
Its been 84 years
I fucking love the new intensity of these videos
I remember one time my teacher got mad at me for mentioning Vancouver Washington in a social studies class when I live in Vancouver Canada
By far the funniest Oversimplified vid I've ever seen.
My hometown of Buffalo,NY was burned to the ground during the war of 1812. There is a War of 1812 cemetery in the town of Cheektowaga on Aero Rd. Canadians and Americans buried side by side.
I have waited six months for this!!!!!!!!!! Time to watch this video 100 times😂😂😂😂😂
YES!
Oversimplified Idea: The Colonization in the Philippines (Spanish, Americam and Japanese Colonization)
28:37 most accurate representation of Buchanan i've ever seen
God I love this channel
OmG. How can miss 7 hours in my life so bad. ;(
It was a straight line except for that island. I'm with the Americans on this one.
The wait was worth it absolutely
Canadians: Why are y not talkin vout us Balkans (who has bunxh of crazy wars): we dont exist
As a Canadian, that ending seems scary, except drake as president
I have whate 7 monds fore this
I wish you produced the videos more often. I love them and it takes so long between vids
The king of history is back!
can you do a 1812 war video between canada and america?
It might be a bad thing to want, but I kinda want more wars just to see this guy animate about them
What are your sources?
That ending was 🔥🔥🔥
As someone who lives near the San Juan islands, on the mainland of Canada, this is the first I'm hearing about this part of our shared history. So thank you and keep up the fantastic work!
Yes new video
I read "The Ping War"
Your content has gone from cute fun 10-15 minute videos, to full on satirical documentary style videos, your channel is amazing thanks for putting out the epic content :D
Indepedence.....................
Finally, 6 months of waiting, you uploaded a masterpiece video again Keep it up 🎉

"joe biden said come" - joe biden

So crazy to see a channel I’ve weirdly obsessed over cover the tiny little part of the world I call home!! Wild bit of history that I had no clue about before!!! YOU HAVE MADE MY WEEK OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!

All i get from this video is, america was a whinny baby that got their way by sending their own citizens into foreign land illegally.

18:48
If you guys invade does that mean we have to suffer from your awful medical bills? That’s basically all I have a problem with other than the fact I’ll be seen as an American :^
I am surprised as heck rn
Ill go ahead and make a draft to congress for a declaration of war with canada right now
Everytime I see a new video from Oversimplified, I know the wait will have been worth it. This time is no different! Keep up the good work friend, whoever you are… We appreciate you!
Whenever oversimplified posts its videos it is an amazing day
USA!!!!!
Love vid

Just in time for my history test

Oversimplified l? New video? Oh boy oh boy, do a mongol history next!
America is about to make Canada great again lmao

Whoever modeled the pigs after Waddles needs a raise
bruh
I never clicked this fast ever.
You can post that Vietnam War video any time now, Oversimplified.
33:22

About time,. Can't wait for the next one. Soon i hope... Best one so far
i’m not even skipping this ad, that’s how much I love this. this video seriously fucks, man- I have a rock hard history boner right now.
18:16 is that Technoblade's ancestor?
the transition to the nord sponsorship was so funny
Sadge bisons :(
Eii nice explanation!!  Although we don't study this on our school... But still so "oversimplified"
Russian civil war next?
This was a fantastic video! you did a really great job on this one.
i came to a conclusion that both the rival are in a questionable state throughout history
I wish oversimplified would like to feature Philippine American War
He just went full on for this video
"That would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties. And there's no way i'm ever going to agree to it."  American politics explained.
I mean, institute universal healthcare and dial back the guns a bit and Canada'd probably be okay joining you
At last after 6 month his is back  ... Uhhhh
Last time I was this early, Hitler wasn't punished severely by his father.
After a long time

Do Catherine the great!
Always wonder straight line cause much trouble lol
So Pickett is an idiot for obeying his superior officer’s orders? Harney was foolish without a doubt, but Pickett wasn’t. Also Scott was a southerner.
10:23 I love the fact that it's pretty much the video compilations of MP's behaving badly
A true masterpiece
I loved the Manifest Destiny part of America moving west....It was SO American...LOL!!!!
I’ve missed oversimplified so damn much. Perfect Christmas gift
Finally
I imagine that politics back then where just a bunch of kids who never got to share the tv remote and they are all fighting over it.
33:45 Harney: _"I don't want peace I want problems always"_
This is without a doubt the Canadian Episode on Oversimplified, all because of that ending.  O' Canada 🇨🇦
Seven Years' War next
NICE
Love this channel, thanks for the edutainment.
I just want to know what your neighbors were thinking during that ending
Zhuge liang northern expeditions
Pog
It’s crazy I was just thinking of the similarities of the U.S idea of manifest destiny VS. Hitlers’ idea of a self sufficient Germany and a day later you make a video about it lol
Ok but can we talk about the last 45 seconds? 🤣
finallyyyyy!!!!! glad for this new videoo
ur the best  oversimplified
That ending was just... *chef's kiss
That was the best cinematic outro ever conceived :@
Oversiplified and the salt factory releases today!
Played just 60 seconds and I can see your level of production has improved. I love it!
There is a lot of Indian-Pakistan history you can make videos on. It'll expose you to the millions of indian and Pakistani viewers as well. Win-win.
General Harney: AKA the Donald Trump of the time.
HES BACK LETS FUCKING GO!!!
Early Christmas has come
Nothing could've prepared me for that ending...truly.....perfect😆 🏴‍☠️🇺🇲
it is 7 o'clock, I just arrived home from a party in Madrid, and I won't sleep until I saw this
I mean he’s got a point with that whole invading canada thing
Oversimplified can you please do the Vietnam war or korean war
Calling it the pig wars is kind of like calling WWI "The war over Archduke Franz Ferdinand". Seems a bit inaccurate in conveying the motives of the opposing sides
Babe Wake Up  New Oversimplified dropped.
Wolverine was born in 1832. I wonder whether he fought in _this_ war too.
I loved the rant at the end  But seriously oversimplified, talk about india
The ending was so epic his voice changed completely
Yes new video
Dos country amerika have a pp?
And man is back lads truly a perfect present on Christmas
This is my favorite video by far
That was fun, now back to my hibernation for another 6 months
Sup
That was the most legendary Oversimplified video ending
In summary: shooting domesticated pigs on british isle is a big no no
It's like a festival to me when he uploads
Someone should fire the guy yelled at the end of video :))
One of the best times of the year when you see an oversimplified post
Oversimplified never fails to entertain and educate. Enterducate.
It was kind of unsettling to hear oversimplified‘s voice turn into a crazy psychopaths voice.
The greatest video of Oversimplified
Not only animations, the voice acting also has improved. This is some topnotch historian, folks
132k likes and no dislikes wow
For the algorithm!
Make video on Indian history
Wow, These videos just keep getting better and better... Especially ones relating American history...
I don't get how Star Wars has anything to do with this but the thumbnail is hilarious
28:07 You know, the thing that makes you stand out among all the other history youtube channels is that your content is so gay. And I am so here for it XD
The United States may have conquered San Juan Island, but that pig conquered my heart.
The pig looks like Toodles!
3:38 florida sus
Finally a oversimplified video
That ad transition was golden lmao internet historian would be proud.
Can you do a swedish empire next?
Borders everywhere around the world: made from centuries of war and negotiations Borders in North Africa: straight line STRAIGHT LINE
Piggy boys
Well the root of the war of 1812 was the US attempting to invade Canada, and they failed, so I would call that a loss. For someone that disagrees with me, I ask what you would call a win for Canada? Don't forget the brits beat back into American territory and messed up there stuff too!
i miss you oversimplified 😭😭😭😭
Was talking to my friends just yesterday about if he was ever gonna upload again. My prayers to the gods were answered
I think this is the most emotion I’ve seen in a video of his. Also loved this video so much.
We want Indian revolution
Petition to thank Oversimplified for posting something (we did it boys)
Ahhhh the [smooth taste] of Canada[ian perspectives in world history] presented by a very [oversimplified] [hyperlink blocked]
I am a simple man.. I see oversimplified video, I click on like button
Can you do breking up of yugoslavia?
Every episode becomes more unhinged
It is a true talent to insert an ad into your videos and have them remain entertaining.

This man loves nord vpn so much he forgot to post on half a year
Ye
28:11 his lil smile it's so cute    •ᴗ•
Guess who's back, back again. Oversimplified's back, tell a friend.
As someone from Canada and who rarely comments. I see the ending like, “I know it’s a joke , but ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.” Like I was thinking before that the pig looks like waddles, but now I just feel off.
Only canada
I love the last part
the legend has rose again!!!!!!!
Don't you dare touch Mexico!!!. If you do, we will be throwing chanclas everywhere
LETS GET THOSE DAMN CANADIANS BOYS
Hrheeee
I was walking through the halls of my secondary school, then I looked to my left and saw one of the history teachers using one of your videos!
oversimplified invading Canada is thr next episode
I'm in agreement with Weird Al... pre-emptive strike on those damn maple backs.
Yessssss He's back!!!!!!
Oversimplified  man can u ,make a video on how Britian took over India?
Hope the next video will discuss ‘the land of the rising sun’, Japan!!
Yet Americans says they didn't colonize and didn't commit any imperial atrocities.  Typical....
What a bunch of propaganda.
Yo he back
Imagine if Canada and the US actually did become one...  *"I here by proclaim thee, Canadia."*
I mean I know it’s funny to talk about Biden invading Canada, but the man is senile and can be convinced of anything evidently.
omg omg omg omg omgo mgomg omgo mgomg ogm ogmgom ogm another oversimplified VIDEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is why I love Oversimplified, he makes some random hilarious jokes in the middle of a historical video just so it doesn't get boring....
God that Canadian Rant has me rollin
I came, I saw, I click
Oversimplified: *makes a video* NordVPN: you again?
Hands down, this is my most favourite channel on YouTube!  You're part of the reason I give a damn about history,you make the stories worth listening to.
rocking sheep 😆.   .. 🤘🤘 .. 🤩🤧.
Finally a new episode
Please do Vietnam next
Chime outright stole his intro style.
I almost just scrolled past cause I didn't realize this was a new video. I just finished binge watching (again) the older videos.
What a time to be Alive
Come on up americans, I gladly take the opportunity to be able to just move to Florida 😁
From Washington I can confirm that this is the most important war in all of history
Oh no, Oversimplified caught a case of the Manifest Destiny! Quick, someone get him Article 2(4) of the UN charter and some Degrassi reruns!
imagine someone rips their skin to reveal they're a company
Make a russian civil war video
After watching, i got to know why it took over 6 months to make this video
10:23 When your trying to explain the rules of a board game to your group of friends.
Lols you made mafia pig sound like fat Tony. Great video. Best content on YouTube. Youre one of my favorite channels. I scream whenever I see an upload.
Haha yes new video!!!! Been craving for your masterpieces!!! 🔥🤣😅
I like how he actually recognized Moraine Lake as Banff.
If u dont buy OverSimplified plushie nor support NordVPN or Honey then You will be Oversimplified will say all the iconic line!
As an American : all in favor of not invadeing Canada say I
Yay!
I'm a Canadian and I'm scared of the ending
That’s 38 minutes of my life 😂
Damn brits chanting about moles.
OverSimplified can truly talk about *every* topic!
Wuuuuuuuuh
"Wake up honey, new OverSimplified video"
I liked this before I watched it. I’m that confident.
Lol been watching for years and now there's a episode about my home town
I'll just leave this here 10:22
I'm sure Canadians will be very frightened.       Once Biden learns to stop falling down the stairs (lol)
Canadians should be scared
I love how the entire live chat at the end was just "U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!" lmao
you should do one of san Antonio.. how most of these dum people think driving a car makes you rich and gives them the right to look down on others just cause your wearing a coat on cold days .. wtf.. sorry  but most if the loser here think their on my level..    not even close.
man i got to manifest some destiny
Why is ending always the best part?
i agree lets invade
Oink oink, Waddles! ;) William S Warney sounds like the Donald Trump of the 1840''s
Take your medicine pal
*THE LONG WAITED PHROPECHY HAVE ARRIVE AT LAST*
LEZZZGO
33:02 is my fave part
He's back
bruv you ant touching any of the comenweathy with your stupidty
Harney was literally known by the name “woman killer” among the Lakota Indians. He had a mountain in South Dakota named after him that after years and years of legal fights the Lakota were finally allowed to rename Black Elk. Still waiting on the state to rename Custer State Park but that’s another battle for another day.
Literally the best blend of advertising.  I'm not even mad about it. It makes the stories better.
Wait… I thought he was dead?
924,000th ~ish
Thx for early Christmas
That Bri'ish parliament scene is the most random and funniest shit I've seen this year
I like the last part and the pig killing
I was not expecting that ending... not at all
I absolutely loved it!!! As a Canadian, I don't know if I should be worried or just laugh lol
Oooo
Today is a good day
YESSSS FINALLY
"Is that too much to ask, PRINCESS"  25:00
Can you PLEAASEE make a video about the roman empire
A NEW VIDEO LETSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO
lets go, Canada video, and in BC
... And that's how the Oversimplified War on Canada started.
Angery bord
The legends were true!
....ooooor would the Americans have lost the war disgracefully as the three times they attempted to invade Canada?
These videos keep getting better and better.
Another banger
Pigs use NordVPN.
He’s back!
hahaha I really love the end, greetings from Alberta OverSimplified, really love your videos
the return of the king
Oh dear don't tell Brandon to invade Canada, he may actually listen
The Stealth jets.
Finally a new Video!
Can you plz do rusian baltic fleat adventures in rusojapan war. Plz
LETS GOOOOO!
We need Catherine The Great oversimplified!!!
No you my dear friend over simplified you should be the one sleeping with one eye open
Talk more about Canada
As a Washingtonian who has visited the san juan islands, Its nice to see this funny and stupid dispute oversimplified (now if only he could add a section about point Roberts) ;)
Your back
man we really needed so much meat that we needed a pig war
Fellas I know I'm not happiest person here today, and I'm daaaaamn happy
ITS BEEN 6 MONTHS YAS
Still no vietnam-war oversimplified man
THE KING IS BACK
This is the most aggressive he has ever been in a video. Man did not hold back.
He needs someone.         and that might be you and buy his goddamn plushies
bro make a vid on indo war
One of your best videos ever! Up and above! Definitely gonna rewatch. Can you hire a bigger team? I mean I understand good videos take time but i am sure you can somehow accelerate it. Maybe work harder, idk
Damn first minute got me cringing already
Oversimplified calm down plz no more invading please
Dang, and it’s not like we can put up much of a fight either, half our army consists of two mountees, a one horned moose and an angry beaver.
don't make us burn down the Whitehouse again
Canada has a bigger military budget then any other army in the world tho 37:18
Oh damn. The video is so entertaining. I didn’t realized the video is almost 40 minutes long!
Idk but I bet like he's doing a Vietnam war video next 5:00
Our hero is back
i didn’t believe they uploaded i thought it was someone with the oversimplified name and profile pic trolling 😂😂
I was wondering what was taking OverSimplified so long, but as a Canadian, that ending was by far the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while
Never knew my state was fought for so much, that's really cool.
This may be my favorite oversimplified. Lots of filler. But given the subject, it was an awesome time to play with that 😅
sorry canada, mostly about trudeau but also ya know for this guys ending <3
huge disappointment man i cant believe i waited six months to watch you talk about an island dispute and a dead pig .
POOoOGGG
I love this
Waking up and seeing a new oversimplified, me: AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
I’m not lying; I have a stuffed wolf from Yellowstone named Porky, and that got weird real fast
hi
Charles Griffin and the Pig: the saddest love story ever.
Finally les go
I love how u made cover as star wars style
New Christmas
Canada won Niagara Falls therefore winning the war of 1812
I have a feeling that if I were President I would be a bit like Buchanan. Thankfully no one is stupid enough to vote in someone like me.
I love this
"Straight line?" "Straight line!" 😄😄😄
Christmas came early this year
Yay new vid and new info thanks oversimplified I really learned a lot from your vids they are fun an amazing
It would be tragically funny if in 50 years or so a oversimplified-esk presenttuber (the future version of a youtuber) makes an AR holo-video of how in 2022 a war erupted between the USA (now North Mexico) and Canada (Now the beaver republic) because some idiot named OverSimplified made a declaration of war in his "youtube"
YYYEEEEEEAHHHHHH BABYYYYYY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
legendary ending . god bless america and now the canadians will immediately say sorry to the comments that complain about oversimplified not talking enough about canada ( as usual)
I'm learning about history in the funniest way possible.  Lol
Finally after 6 month oversimplified back again
Canadian viewers: “You don’t talk about Canada enough”  Oversimplified: “Oh I will now, and when I do you’ll be punished severely….”
:O
u have only taken the name "India" two time in all of your videos even thought it is the 7th largest country
14:05 “but being an American, he came out with 4 pistols and a big knife” I LOLed way too hard for someone who does in fact own 4 pistols and a big knife
It was such a long wait that it almost killed me. Oversimplified has become such an integral part of my life now. Although I know it takes a great deal of time and effort to craft such masterpieces, it would be greatly appreciated if you uploaded more videos in a year. If possible, that is.
Good god, and now we have a channel within that group of islands named after Harney.
Finnaly a new vis
I feel like I just got that sweet dose of heroine after a long, cold widthdrawing
Was there a bunch of rhyming or am I tripping? (Btw this is my absolute favorite channel ever!!)
The ending enraged Canada who drank maple syrup severely
I’m pissing tears and hold my sides rright now😂. Out of all the fucking topics to make a mini wars about😂. Not the Crusades, War on Terror, Vietnam War, Joan of Arc, Apartheid, Genghis Kahn, etc. This is what we he picked😂. This video is so over the top and fucking daffy I love it😂.
Fun fact for me : i actually made a union with canada under the north american prime minister/President we agreed to be a union but we do our own thing the flags still exist and the original borders as regions. What game i Rped This : World Conquest Roblox
Petition for over simplified to cover Battle of plassey and buxar in india
Nice Thanks
That new manifest destiny had me dead, as dead as that pig! 😂
Well, you heard it lads. This video is his official declaration of war on Canada
Can u do history for phillipines Plsssss Phillipine Revolution Pls make this video btw i love ur vids😃😃😃😃
The Emu War War of the bucket The Pig War What's next?  The water war?    Also do the Winter War next...
the only thing that scares me about America is biden sniffing our childrens necks and hair .... fucking pedo ! 🤣🤣
As a Canadian, I don’t like that outro
WHAT WAS THAT ENDING? Do you want to start a war over the pig now?
Make video about India
Oversimplified thinking the perfect Christmas gift*  OS: Here's the gift
“Almost asking to be fired upon.” I think Pickett’s entire career can be summarized as standing around, asking to get his men shot.
Holy Cow, what an absolutely amazing video.
Finnaly oversimplified uploads after 6 months See you after an year lol
ANNEX CANADA!! THEY HAD IT TO GOOD FOR TO LONG MAKE THEM THE NEXT 5 STATES OF AMERICA
OMG NEW VID
I learn more shit from these videos than in my actual history class
dude, VERY COOL!
I’m so hyped
I’m so hype
I love your videos they always put a smile on my face I hope to see more soon
He had a ultra brake down at the end
He finally posted🐐💖
Quite weird on how a small thing almost "nearly" broke a major war, what's next? "A street vendor burnt himself to death, and nearly made the region unstable for almost a decade now?"
Killed your pig  Killed your pig  Killed your pig
LETS GOO BEEN WAITING  FOR HE CAN POST
Playing Waltz of the Flowers during the Nutcracker season 😂
I'm so glad we didn't go to war over a stupid pig. Because that would undoubtedly rival "The Great Emu War" as the single dumbest war fought in human history.
He's back when the world needed him the most.
OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED AND I AM SIMPLY OVERJOYED
There's technically no reason why the U.S. hasn't annexed the entire western hemisphere of the planet. It's not like anybody else could really do anything about it. Also it'd save millions of immigrants thousands of miles of perilous journey.  "You won't need to come to America! America will come to you!"
i am concerned to say the least after watching the end...
Yikes the politics in this video…. I remember when he just gave the facts with lighthearted jokes
OverSimplified, never stop making videos.
Thanks Santa!
wake up babe oversimplified just uploaded a video
Please make a video on India and Pakistan wars
wayne gretzky is already a traitor waving the american flag
*Day ruined* *Oversimplified posted new video* *Day restored*
He did it,the Mad man did a video about it
I vaguely remember learning about this growing up in washington state history. it was more or less "man killed a pig, it caused a war. isn't that crazy kids?!"
amazing video
Aww Damir another six months to go to the next vid😂
The pig looks like waddles from Gravity Falls.
I have a feeling OverSimplified is having fun making these videos.
All good points about invading Canada except one... Oversimplified for President 2024.
Hi OverSimplified, I don't think enough people realize how realistic that ending is. "Why not", indeed. :D
Finally new video
Let's gooooo
As his decent into more abstract historical topics becomes deeper, so to does his voice
Bro that ending though, ik he was joking but dam he started slow and logical then it went extreme and crazy.
It's ben to long sence I'v heard this mans voice.
Fun fact: There is more hunters in Iowa than there is Canadian soldiers
Favorite oversimplified video so far. So good
I was just at the San Juan islands this is really cool to know
You know….  The US is just weird.
i showed the ending to my sister, she laughed, then said it's garbage
Hey Oversimplified! Can you make a video on the Cod Wars? It would be actually funny considering that the Brits were defeated against the meagre Icelandic Coast Guard.
Whooooooooooooo
You should do a video on Operation Paul Bunyan!
The pig war?
36:57
I deeply enjoyed this video. There are so many history channels on youtube but they all like to cover the same topics that everyone already knows about assuming that will get them more clicks. But this was actually something I imagine was completely new to most people, done in OverSimplified's unique and entertaining style. Looking forward to the next upload
truly a masterpiece
He’s back! And not two weeks after I said he died
Always glad to watch your stuff.
00:47 history in a few words
WOO HOO NEW UPLOAD
Lol I wish it was more
As a Washingtonian, I've heard about this off and on but never really got all the details. Weird seeing my local area covered in a OS video, but neat!
Bro I thought the nord vpn person was just Justin Bieber with blue hair
"The Americans were coming and they won't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running"
I literally just watched the CGP grey video about the US/Canada border RIGHT before watching this, so it was surreal to hear you talk about the mapping issue that led to the weirdness around that lake.
There you have it. Oversimplified endorses Day of the Rake.
Nice, for any upcoming video by this channel, I'd like to watch a video about Mexican-American War.
He got a little overboard with the U.S. takes canada.     Anyways anybody want poutine?
15:04 How can just one sheep sink a boat and throw a man??
Idea india
The history test tm* Me who watch the over simplified video: pathetic
I love how oversimplified manages to turn history that may be considered boring to something fun and entertaining
I was born and raised in Kenora Ontario, on Lake of the Woods. I had no clue the lake held such importance!
I misd u
A comment for my future self asking if watching this vid at midnight was better than studying. How well did u do on that essay bro? :)
as a canadian i find it interesting how we were taught, in the war of 1812 we burnt down the whitehouse and won by a landslide, yet in america they were taught that the brits burnt the whitehouse down, and it ended in a draw.
I for one look forward to this war. I'm always up for a chance to reduce the human population.
Honey wake up oversimplified uploaded
Deep in the back of my conscience, every day I wonder when there will be another OverSimplified video.
Straight line? Straight line. Hahaha
AWESOME VIDEO, glad to see youre still making em!!!!!!!!
He made a video about America and Canada going to war over something stupid, and then threatened to go to war over something stupid.
With Biden being president, the Canadians unfortunately have nothing to fear from us
You should do a video on Alexander the Great
😂
Bro is about to destroy my sleep schedule
Please try Indian Revolution
I could've used this 2 months ago
Alt:wat of 1812 in a nutshell
This is my favorite history channel. Could you guys cover the sengoku period of Japan cuz I liked the 3 kingdoms video a lot
AYO WAS THAT EEL SLAP?!?!?!
Hey Oversimplified, great vid. .......HOWEVER....KEEP YOU KARENS AND YOUR NO GUN CONTROL ON THAT SIDE OF THE STRAIGHT LINE!!!!!!! Invade us and we'd make Vietnam look like a garden party.  .... sorry that ending miffed me for some reason. Poutine?
LES GOOOOOO, NEW VID
Awesome
Damn I love this kind of content
HEEEEESSSSSS BACK!!!!
Yo! Wtf? You don't hear us indians showing off our men and youth power we'd lit out number you 1-5
Today, 1 on 1, the US would definitely defeat us Canadians. The slight problem, however, is that such an invasion would literally open World War 3. 😅
That ending: *fallout flashbacks*
Amazing video! I was waiting for long
Babe wake up oversimplified posted
I-i what happened to over simplified at the end there....d-does he want us to take Canada?..I mean I don't see why not
If Biden invaded Canada, we would end up having to give them New York and lose half of our nuclear weapons
One correction a historical inaccuracy at 16:01 the American pulled out a AK-47. An American would never put air in AK-47.
That's it, this video is right. We must manifest destiny Canada
33:25 LMFAO
Why doesn’t USA, Mexico and Canada join as one? It could be the power house of the worlds! Beat China in the economy.
the ending has had the most emotion I’ve heard from oversimplified
I wonder if this video would get banned in Canada...
Not only a brilliant oversimplified, but nice job digging up such a quirky episode in history! Classic Oversimplified!
Hell yea just as I’m looking for a video to watch with my dinner this shows up! Freakin perfect dude! Great video.
The GOD ALMIGHTY has spoken
bangladesh war 1971
Babe wake up, oversimplified posted
Missed you man
babe wake up, new oversimplified lore just dropped
At the end, well....., 2nd Cold War, thats.....China......, good luck to see you guys fail so you can pay us a trillion USD/AUD.
History made fun
The Pig War - hm more like technoblade and dream smp
I love how he picks more obscure events to talk about. Also this is the funniest oversimplified video yet.
Yo! Wtf?
yooo he finally uploaded lez go
When Oversimplified says you weren't the reason a video was made possible 😭
When I saw this title, I thought it was about the Hatfields and McCoy's. Never knew about this conflict...in my own backyard! Thank you for the upload, great content as usual
The Return of the King
Holy crap that last part of the video was the FUNNIEST THING ON THIS FREAKING PLANET I LAUGHED MY GOD DANG HEART OFF
oh my god its happening the legend is back
It’s just the voice!
brilliant
Is it me or does oversimplied sound a little more crazy in this video
Can you foreshadow the Taiwan/China war??
The gist of this episode would be..  Lyman shot the pig!
The pig was behind everything, I knew it
less gooo u made my history grades lol
Anyone else realize that the pig was Waddles from Gravity Falls?
Imma be honest, I'd like to see you yanks try
I didn’t know oversimplified could upload
The ending tho
As a Washingtonian that visited the San Juan Islands, I do have to say they are very beautiful.
Funny how us Americans aren't taught about all this pillaging we did to the west. It's almost like we were exactly like the British, we just wanted to do it ourselves. Hmm, makes you think
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH finalllllllllllllllllllllllly
5:54 Bruh! amazing vid
I know it was a joke but how horrible would the us Canada be
why no Indonesian subtitles?
your older
Yey plusiee
So basically, General Harney...was just the worst
“The Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming…” -Japan Circa 1945
oversimplified friendly reminder that Canadians are nice when it comes to everything other than hockey and war don't force our hand would hate to have that come between us as it wouldn't end well... love the videos keep up the good work
Yes! Finally another masterpiece!
As a Canadian, that ending made me cry and shake with fear
TFINALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY
This episode was really funny but there wasn't much actual history to make a video on :(
yay he's back everyone think your died.
Ive seen napoleon too much in Oversimplified videos
Future video ending: “and that, my dear viewers, is how one educational video resulted in Canada taking over the United States of America”
Gg
Morgan Freeman the pig?
YEAAAAAAAH BABYYYY That’s what ive been waiting for that’s what ITS all about
Certified lover boy by drake was the lamest album of the year so far lol
wheres my vietnam vid?
C ya in 6 months, excellent video!
War of the pigs you say?   More like I would love to call: *‘War of the Dumb-dumbs'*
The last minute of the video almost make me believe if this video hijacked by someone before uploaded
I love is animation and knowledge of even small things starting a big one ☝️
that pig is waddles from gravity falls
what a potato... or a pig?
Whenever oversimplified uploads I feel like I'm about to watch a movie
The messiah hath returned to us!
Ah, so that's why us americans like guns so much.Turns out they were pretty useful for manifest destinying british settlers.
The GOAT is back.
Such a good story
His voice was so foreign at the end...
Some time ago our history teacher showed us one of your vids  That was awesome  But a lot of ppl hated him for some weird reason
Bruh u threatened all of Canada xD!!
Another Great War animated by Oversimplified. Today’s a good day.
This video is so incredible. You always step it up. You don't need to though! I love how you prefer quality over quantity too! Never be too afraid to post something though!
Funny
YAY! Finally a new video (the pig war lol) quite funny
WHAT AN ENDING!!!
Oversimplified uploading a video makes me A S C E N D
WhErE ViEtNaM WaR
Yeeess new vid
here before 800k views
I only wonder why they let Germany decide over the conflict. Were they especially neutral to the matter or something?
It looks like Christmas came early this month
Maple is the new oil baby!
lmao British parliament was so accurate. It's still the funniest live telly show to this day.
US taking over Canada?  You ever played Fallout?
That ending just made me stand up and salute the flag it was so good
YOOOO
Babahahaha best comedic history ever and I never learned this
My 7x great grandfather Sir George Cockburn was the British Admiral who ordered the burning of the white house in 1812
I am actually aroused
get ready to make WW3
Biden's coming? I thought it was Drake
OVERSIMPLIFIED WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS!!!!
You haven’t uploaded in SIX MONTHS
The last minute of the video felt like a fever dream
The mans lost it
Woo hoo, new video!
God bless that ending
Yes... YES!!! MORE WESTWARD EXPANSION VIDEOS!!! I loved this, you did outstanding!! I hope that post-Civil War westward expansion, like the Sioux War and Apache wars are on the table for the future! Again, loved this video, especially General Scott kicking General Harney's butt!!
That has to be the best ending that I have ever seen.
Okay, let’s all agree to get our lives together and start successful companies so that we can all fund Oversimplified.  Deal? Deal.
United States can invade Canada at any point and we could, destroy it deeply…
That ending was amazing.
Laughed like a little kid at the Jizzingjam Earl part  !? 🤣😂
Invade Canada quickly! They’ve just depleted half of their emergency maple syrup reserves (no seriously, that is true) and therefore will be too distraught to mount a resistance!
I swear the content quality of this channel is getting better.
Grabs shotgun YOU HEARD HIM BOISE, TO THE NORTH! AAAAAAHHHHHHHH
where 'nam
Invade Canada! The better half of Niagara Falls rightfully belongs to us!
18:17 spudcest
See America, you've always been like this
FINALLY!!!!!!!!
Just because of oversimplified now i like history
I can't wait to watch the Oversimplified video of the historical event where Oversimplified started the war with Canada.
Can you please make video about Jugoslavia civil war?
there is 1 reason the US doesn't take over canada... cost. Canada benefits too much from the US to even dare talk war and the massive cost of footing the bill for not only the war, but also federalizing the resources we already receive, including their population into our federal aid programs, and reorganizing their territories into states for proper voting is just not worth the effort. They are basically like our friendly neighbors who we have little to no political discourse with... though we are still trying to get them to drill through 300ft of permafrost and frozen earth to access some of the largest untapped crude oil in the world.  Mexico and the central americas are more likely targets if we were serious into expansion. The main target would be gaining full control over the panama canal, but the cheep labor, expanded sea boards with reduced land borders, and additional rare earths are all a big plus. Our eastern coast has a massive population, but pacific shipping lanes have to wait up to a month and pay thousands just to use the canal that WE built, putting additional stress on our highway and railing infrastructure. (Covid brought this weakness to light) Though central america may seem poor, it's because it is primarily controlled by dictators and drug traffickers; a bit of americanization can quickly turn it into an industrial zone that would completely break our reliance on foreign countries.  PS: I DO NOT PROMOTE WAR WITH MEXICO x.x China and our 30 trillion dollar debt needs to get its ass kicked before we think of something like that
LET’S DO IT!! WE’RE COMING FOR YOU, CANADA!!!!!!!!!
Its like an esrly christmas gift
At last!!! a new video❤️❤️❤️
oh boy
You forgot the Indians fought for the British in two war, for Mexico, for the confederacy, and many raids by Indians helped justify expansion
i hate them canadians invade them, jo bidome gonna send all 6 seals to conquer them
Can you make a video on unification of Germany(1866 - 1871) and Italy(1860 - 1870), its in my exam and your vids are so good that it makes the concept clear.  During my last test I had French revolution and I saw your vid and scored good grades in history..
I’m Canadian yet I think the ending is the best thing I’ve seen all day
Why can’t my history teacher be you?
LMAO!! making Florida look like dick of The US was just the chefs kiss. 😂😂
another cool video
That ending was a real eye opener. If you promise to take Canada I'll vote for you.
That ending was beautiful.
Yes, new video!!!!!!!
omg finnally i new oversimplified video
OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED OMG. ITS A CHRISTMAS GIFT YOOOO
When is he gonna do potato war
Dude should have been a rapper, he's got bars 😭😭
Ok, I think he's lost it now
That ending was amazing
What about the one with Fortunate Son as the theme song?!
God I love these videos 😂
we're coming for you canada... it's only a matter of time
To think i was this close to being an American. wo
Oversimplified  im the only fan of you from india please upload videos about india too and upload your  videos  regularly  please
Let's fricking goooo. I just woke up looked on YouTube and instantly  I have a theme I can steal for History Class.
Oversimplified should lead the initial troops into Canada.
Joe Biden has no shot of finding Canada on a map.
It's so sad we need to wate a nother 6 months for a new video
I like how the pig is waddles from gravity falls
soooooo uhhhhhh anyone else seeing waddles here?
33:25 is my favorite hahaha 😂
lets do it
OMG, that ending 😂
0:15 That really is an oversimplified plushie
As a canaidian, I am wondering how i close 1 eye while going to sleep.
"Our dedicated boys keep the peace in newly annexed Canada."
He back
Christmas came early this year ❤️
Seeing the German Empire doing something generally normal and not being the big bad of the world was surprisingly refreshing to see
FINALLY
return of the king
Fucking finally!!!! Sorry... Just it's been so long....
MOM OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED A VIDEO
Babe wake up, OverSimplified posted
Omg the animation 😂 very good work sir!
I literally cannot like this enough
Lol hi
next = korea civil war
Probably your best video to date! The jokes are on point!
Can you make a mini-war episode for the Bangladesh Pakistan war. I'd very much love that
Can they annex Mexico while they're at it, this government is absolute shit.
As an a American I Love this
“With their affordable insulin” LMAOOO😂😂😂😂😂
Yeh i happy your back
The musical timing from 38:00 to the end is exquisite
Biden probably doesn't remember where Canada is
I love Oversimplified for really underlining how much of history is just idiots acting like assholes.
☄️☄️☄️☄️🔥🔥AVENGERSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️☄️☄️
New video, been waiting for so long
Well invading Canada wouldn't be the dumbest thing Biden's done.
"the Americans felt that they were  entitled to collect taxes on British property" UNO REVERSE
No one gonna talk about the Star Wars themed thumbnail?  It looks better than the non-existent Star Wars Episode 9 The Rise of Skywalker...
Another banger from OverSimplified! We always have to wait a while (understandable, considering how much time and effort it takes to make one of these masterpieces), but his videos keep getting better and better every time, and they always teach me a lot! Keep up the good work:) (Also, as a Canadian, that ending was awesome, lol😅😂. Bring it on!!)
It's been 84 years....
Finally N upload
Yay you upload a new video !
This is how ALL history should be taught. Please please please please please please please... *inhaaaaale* pleaaaaaaaaaaaase keep making videos!
Every video gets better and better, absolutely love it
You have 5.2 million subscribers, thats quite the sizeable army.... we could do it ourselves and call it the Over Simplified United States!!!!!!
Keep the tiny bit of edginess it's the best part of this channel by far
This makes me emotional on another level. We will always remember the pig.
Wow.   New video 🤩
Oh, the heart break i experienced when i saw there was no "part 1" at the end of the title of this video. Means there is only 1 video 😥
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ENDING
It's funny how NordVPN has been supporting Oversimplified for so long, that it has litteraly become a character in almost all the episodes
That ending made me feel very patriotic
10:22 ah yes the British parliament.
The return of the king
I want Canada
The expressions in these are perfect
whoa there buddy... calm down. You're gonna have a heart attack and I don't want you to have to file bankruptcy from medical debt.  Shame about your private Healthcare ;)
The content of this channel is exceptional, hilarious, and thoughtful. The only thing I'd like to mention (personal canadian opinion) that if American tanks enter Canada it will because we invite them,to defend our sorry asses from foreign powers. We would be annexed not conquered
See y’all in 4-6 months 🥲✌🏽
I’ve been saying we should do 37:08 for years
If the us takes over canada i'm leaving
HE’S BACK BABY
On second thought, we shan't go to Canada. Tis a silly place.
😘
18:44 This part is so greatly animated to me
:)
*now that’s controversial*
Oversimplified ...You have simply earned me by that ending....and i dont even belong to either america aur canada. Keep up the gr8 work man !!!!!
The king is back
BTW it's What-cum, not What-calm. Also, Island County would like a word.  The whole set of islands are called the San Juan Islands in addition to the westmost large one also being named San Juan Island, although the other islands are Orcas, Lopez, etc.   The two camps are still maintained as historical sites - "English Camp" and "American Camp." The English camp is the nicest one.  I'll give you points for Point Roberts (heh) correct on the map though
"BIDEN'S COMIN BABY"
Yes an oversimplified upload!
I really love OverSimplified's videos. so simple yet informative.
well that escalated quickly
Oversimplifyed I love you and your ending to this video thank you for making me laugh for almost 20 minute straight and thank you for finally addressing Canada as it should
Holy shit 800k views in just 6 hours
I don’t know why is there a Vietnamese map at 5:03 lol
Your wish of owning Canada came true in the Fallout series. It didn’t end well.
Is it just me or sometime the video gets intrumpted?
yaysies a new video
I love the new way he does his videos it’s so funny and interesting!
Finally

na biden is coming for your children
It’s always a good day when this legend post a video
The man has returned to give us more quality videos
Too long
LETSS GOOOOOOOO
just was literally wondering when an oversimplified post was coming😭
I have no regrets watching these videos every time I feel like they've made the most jokes they can they make it better and better, litteraly made my week.
Welcome back
Finally Another Video🙂🙂🙂
order , order shut up!!!!!! LMAO
I liked this video until the psychopathic end
HE’S BACKKKKK!!!!!
it’s a good day when oversimplified uploads
finally... something new!!!
Oh my goddddddd
Was anybody expecting an alternate history hub collab with that ending? Just me?
Oversimplified please can you make the Indian and Pakistan war
Great for Europeans such as myself because we frankly don't care so much about that small stretch of time you guys call "history".
Finally His Back!
FINALLY
can you do war on terror next
Long time no see
Our lord and saviour has blessed our hearts and minds with another wonderful video, and now to wait 3-6 months for another video.
Canada better sleep with one eye open…nah jk, great video btw man.
Please make a video on the Indian Freedom Struggle :):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
And then you think, would the USA go to war with Canada over a Youtube video? Would people die because of a cartoon figure told them to manifest destiny to create the Greater United States?
I didn’t know Oversimplified could sound so vengeful  D:
Can we not take a moment for the American that slammed a McDonald’s onto native americans
LETS GO NEW VIDEO
That "All Star" reference was god-tier
Can u make a video about mathias corvin corvinius?
The only casualty of the pig war was, well the pig.    Sad potato noises
As an American, one of my biggest reasons for not wanting to occupy Canada is that I don't want to deal with Quebec. Imagine dealing with Quebec and Texas constantly threatening to succeed
Me, a French Canadian: Haha i'm in danger tabarnak
THE KING IS BACK BABY
About time!
This might be the best video I have ever seen! Congrats!
37:38😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣Ohh please..... Stop⛔, you are making my stomach hurts
OverSimplified videos are unexpected, yet pleasant surprises in my day. And boy am I happy when a new one comes out
Your moms war
Yes finnally after 6 months of wait  Hey make a vid on India’s struggle for independence
Please do the Philippine American War
"7th Earl of Jizzingham"😂😂😂😂
The whole video was great, but that ending was simply amazing! Bravo sir, bravo!
So another incompetent US President is headed towards a major war between two major superpowers. History does repeat itself.
Such a great video holy crap man your insanely talented, thank you so much for making these they are all great!
Both  canada and  USA.
Yaaaay a new oversimplified video and then 5 years later we see a new vid
Pov: your now happy
We hope we have more level headed men as leaders
anyone else here waiting for the vietnam war oversimplified?
And yet...no Vietnam War Oversimplified
love how he represents florida as the u.s. penis
Really neat bit of history that I’d always wanted to learn more about, having lived around there.
Hell yes!
So overall, the war was about if the pig went Morgan Freeman or Clint Eastwood?  What a wonderful time to be alive!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
that ending oh my god 😭😭😭😭
“In the end, neither truly wanted to fight.” I swear, imagine fighting a freaking war over Oregon.
Holy cow….. Germany actually does something that doesnt try to screw the US over!
To be fair, the British had a point  Berkshire pigs are delicious
do stuff on byzantine
The king has returned 👑
Ahh Invasion of canada. Would be great then Invasion of Mexico. We are gonna take their Tacos and their busty women. American Flag should be flying in Mexico City😅🤣🤣. Ah I smoked too much Legal weed
Gotta appreciate a video with Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Napoleon cameos
Just hoping one day for a war of 1812 oversimplified!
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO!!!! Been craving some OverSimplified history lessons  😁
see all of you in another 6 months
i can never believe that he hasnt given up on youtube every time he posts
As a Canadian, I have to say "Eh?" at that ending
I absolutely love what you're doing with the thumbnail.
"Affordable Insulin" 😂😂😂
A pig? 👀 Hmm... does that signal a mini wars video on the Hatfield and McCoy feud in the near future/decade?
What a masterpiece! ❤️
I knew it After yet another 6 months full of waiting and keeping us second-guessing... Oversimplified the Pig War Premiere is out now
the guy who started the destiny part would be held as a hero today because of mental health :)
An Oversimplified video? Amazing. An Oversimplified video that involves MY COUNTRY???? INCREDIBLE edit:   what the fuck
[drives up to Canada immediately to invade] Hey... where's everybody else?
Bro Indian history next time ... Cuz they r very interesting
3:53 "I thought it was Sharon's cat" 🤣
'Merica fuk yeah !
37:30 wow WoW WOW he sounded WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY different!
gg bois
OMG 😍 thank you for the upload literally thought you forgot about your millions of loyal fallowing
I've just now realized that your NordVPN character is their logo attached to a body, and not a blue haired emo.
Those white people am I right? I don't understand why people think white people took native Americans land. They didn't own it. They just lived there. Not saying what they did was ok but it's getting real old
Can't wait for vlogging through history to cover this vid
Wooooo
is this a pig war or a bacon hahaha war? the ending is in lord
This dude is a 🐐
I feel attacked as a Canadian
Oh look who just uploaded
Man, this is the best video I've found in his channel yet
YES NEW VIDEO YN78FHUIB34GRU8BH4T3G9BUY34GTBHU93GT4HBU9
This was the wildest video, and I loved it!
James Bisonette for President of North America....oh wait, wrong youtube channel.
let’s go lyman
Omg the ending
As a Canadian that lives in the US, I’m not sure if I should be worried about the last part…
Wait you killed my pig?!..... uncool
Finally, been waiting for new vid 😂😂
NEW VIDEO
DAY OF THE RAKE. SENILE OLD MAN GONNA GETCHU LEAFS.
And so, War of the Oversimplified was started by one youtuber.
You ok lad ? Your acting like you've sniffed glue for the past months
As a European, that end was the most glorious thing I have had the pleasure of witnessing. Bravo, sir. Bravo indeed.
37:21
Were there guns shotting eachother
I live in TSAWWASSEN, that little line that separates the lower mainland from Washington, found if really interesting that I finally answered why that line is there.
that ending tho, best one ever
best end evah !!!
*DONT LET AN AMERICAN POLITICIAN WATCH THIS VIDEO'S END*
the king has returned
Best birthday present ever!
Yay  got a video
We’ll drown the yanks with are federal reserve of maple syrup if you try
My lord and my saviour is back ;)
How great would it be if the next oversimplified video is just his plan to invade Canada
The U.S expansion westwards, truly a great and controversial debate. I will start it off saying it was great and made the world a better place. Let the debates begin.
fucking finally a vid yaaaaaaaaaay
37:16 alright oversimplified, I think you watched a bit too much Fox news rhetoric
Can I say that oversimplified is a masterpiece all together, interloping story's that we would almost never see coming that are both interesting yet, and history accurate, like what the first nation wared in the beaver seen was on the dot of what the first nation's of what there wore, but it was simplified and all together is like watching  Marvel with its interloping making it almost exceeding all of my thoughts on what will be next and what will happen next.
👌🏾
HE'S BACK!!!
31:03 Ok, that surprised me. Love it lmao
37:17 That is not up to discussion. An invasion of Canada will not happen. Besides, we Americans still own the Stanley Cup from the Canadians for almost 30 years and have the best players in hockey.
"But, being an american he emerged from his tent with 2 pistols and a giant knife", bro had me rolling on the floor 14:01
You just up your comedic level by 100%
Nord VPN has gotta pay you an absurd amount of money to still be your sponsor, these videos trend so high every damn time.
Best ending to a video ever
NEW VIDEO OMG
Yes. Finally. The king has returned
As a Canadian I'm overjoyed at no being American thanks to the peace deal with America getting it's ass kicked with their 'divine purpose' bullshit of expanding.
Ever thought about the war which started because a guy sat on a bottle?
Time to wait half a year for a new video 😭😭😭
Based!
i fucking love this lmasooooo
This would be perfect for a comedic movie
i like this video because this is the same issue as china is taking over some 200 mile chunk of sea from Philippines but The Philippines own it but china consider it as "free land and no one own it anyway" so some Chinese fishing boats and vessel took over some of it now it's threatening another war
Can u do a Mexican revolución 😁😇
Loved the video great work ❤️❤️
Wooly cowards😂😂
The US is summed up :  "Well, that would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interest of both parties,"   " AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M GANNA AGREE TO IT!"
This has been by far the best video I have ever seen. Also I can’t believe a pig almost started a war.
That last bit is probably most passionate his voice has ever gotten in any of his videos.
Make a Video aboit the Great Turkish War
Maybe Oversimplified should do a video the Hatfield-McCoy skirmish.  We need a (joke) Oversimplified video on the Cola Wars of the 1980s.
This really proves that reality is often more crazy than fiction
Yesss another oversimplified video I’ve been waiting so long
The outro song is lit!
waited 7 months for this video, worth it!
Wow how edgy, let me guess you're kosher.
What does them not being white have to do with anything? Can we stop with the race shit? Especially coming from a history channel, who should know better.
I really want to know if Oversimplified wants to start a war between America and Canada, if not a real 'War of the Oversimplified Video', atleast in the comments section.
you couldn't pay me to take ownership of Canada.
OverSimplified is just the better history teacher than the ones we have at school.
top 10 anime with sad ending
I love that the way American solve their problems is just using guns. I can see why Americans love their second amendment.
29:13 The most meaningful time in my life..
Talk about Guatemala, and the chiquita shit tha happened there, if you haven't. Ty!
I love this war so much, I get very happy when someone mentions anything remotely close to where I live or travel regularly
the pig is cute:)
We are still waiting on the vietnam war
A video related to my home state of Washington? It really is Christmas time. The San Juan Islands have always been wacky lol
hot take, vermont maple syrup is better than canadian
Over simplified should do a video on the Mexican and American war
He always does the thing I am learning in history lol.
Shit hit the rails real quick there at the end. Like damn 4 to 100 real quick.
I like how Oversimplifieds voice starts to change as he gets more into his speech 😂
The ending lmao 🤣
Is this a Star Wars short film?
About Pig- 1% About USA VS CANADA- 99%
The ending XD😂
wait so all of this coulda been avoided if lyman just  made a good fence
Are you saying that agents of the United States government raided a ranch noted for its rams?
Bro I'm been waiting for months
MISSED UR CONTENT TONS!!!
Oversimplified is my internet teacher
Finally now the Americans know the real story it's the british who burned the white house not the french canadian. Ty
Thanks OverSimplified for making videos on historical stuff I didn’t even know about. Wild stuff.  Moral of the story: be nice to pigs.
Can you make the Philippine Revolution?
And suddenly, my life just became more complete. Thank you!
this is why you never let your pig eat another mans potatoes
Ya know I just gave a history exam and came home and I was like I wanna watch oversimplified and then u uploaded
Epic! 😂
Oversimplified uploaded a video: oh yeah🤩🤩 You have to wait for 6 months for next video: oh no😵😵
IVE BEEN WAITING SOO LONG
When the world needed him the most, he came back.
American Mounties in the Red, White and Blue. One can dream
I liked the content up to the last minute, that's when you got my Dislike.
YESS NEW VIDEO
4:11 Gorgeous
OverSimplified makes a good point at the end of the video.
Fuck you youtube for removing dislike. Great vid as usual btw
Omg finally it’s been 7 months
Well that's that we have to invade Canada 🇨🇦 . It's our Destiny
*Implies that the US wouldn't seek to expand into lands controlled by white people*  not even 5 seconds later:  *explains how a massive war began because the US wanted a bunch of white-owned land in Canada*  Yeah OK OverSimplified. . .
At last new oversimplified videos wooohoo
Toledo War Please😭😂
The whole Canadian bit at the end was the best however I love this episode
I love how Oversimplified is getting less and less "Oversimplified" WW1 video - 7 minutes WW2 video - 15 minutes War over some north american island most people probably didn't even know existed - 40 minutes
Make indian independence video
i don't like how oversimplified became antifa commie nowadays. Freaking shame. Shitting on people of who were grandfathers of greatest country in the world, comparing them to rats, and noble sacrifice of indigenous people being called the disease.. smh my head
You know , I consider myself a level headed person . That being said , after that ending , MERICA BABYYYYY
Bro I couldn’t agree more with those last 2 minutes
Can't wait to go to an Uncle Sam Horton's for a triple-triple and a box of Freedom Bits.
babe, wake up Oversimplified posted
Not even a minute in and we’re already making bold moves  Edit: Canada belongs to the US
Pig War Is OP
70% at the comments are canadiand
Finally!
A new OverSimplified video? Christmas came early :)
Welp thats another 6 months
This has to be the best oversimplified video.
Do anybody live on those islands  I never heard anybody say that they was from there
As someone who knows Canada is a shithole I don't think America should conquer it. That place just sucks too much would be worth it and it would only take one guy to do it.
OMG THAT ENDING IS AMAZING! Round of applause for Oversimplified. To think that one day, years ago, I got curious about WW1 and looked up YouTube videos about it and found you. I’ve been with you the entire way and I can’t wait to see how you could possibly improve more in the future!
is... this what we waited for
I don’t usually “like” videos, but the ending got one from me
imagine if this started a war
I loved watching this video, especially since I go to those islands every year, thanks so much for this! I never knew about the history till today.
I dont know if I should be legitimately be scared and offended or laugh my ass off at the end of the video
You should do a video on the Residential Schools Of Canada
In the end How to get on the fbi watch list
This Oversimplified was pretty much a South Park episode.
You're back !!!
I'm not sure how a senile vs an economically/power illiterate racist would go. Stay out of my domicile. Best of luck.
Ok man what drinking game did you agree to before writing that last part? Also it’s just cursed hearing oversimplifieds’ voice with a intense tone.
Unfortunately for Oversimplified his commanding officer told him not to invade Canada or he will be transferred to a new command post
That ending has to be the most patriotic thing I’ve ever seen in my life
The Return of The King
The legendary history teacher is back for another round
The sheer amount of dopamine that hits my bloodstream when oversimplified releases a video is enough to sedate a Buffalo.
I went to the British camp that was in the pig war
You know USA is doing smelly stuff when a video about said stuff made a french support the brits.
Oversimplified is back!  Hooray!!
legendary
Bro why hate for Canada did... they hurt u? Also who cares about America
Basically USA always screwing everything since the dawn of time
as a person from wa state this is one of my fave topics to talk about to people from other states and countries. thank you so much for making this
Far and away the best ending to any Oversimplified video😂😂😂
Waiting is waiting
Gg
Do you know how to prevent Canadian bacon from curling.  Take away their little brooms.
Babe wake up oversimplified just posted
He done it. He posted.
General Scott beating the shit out of Harney had me laughing so hard I almost peed
When the entire history students needed him the most, *he returned*
a oversimplified video man this just made my day
When the native Americans have their picnic then they see themselves invaded by two buff countries invading them. Native Americans: WHAT IS GOING ON?? America and Britain: We love your country and want to trade.  1 hour later, Britain and America fight, and the Native Americans goes on a frenzy throwing sheep everywhere. And shooting guns while eating hamburgers.
i JUST searched "what happend to oversimplified" and this came up
That feeling when Oversimplified uploads after months of waiting
That was the funniest video you ever made
Let’s go after all this time he comes out with a new vid
THE ENDING, IT’S BEAUTIFUL. 37:00 IS THE THE STAMP OF THE MASTER PIECE
Um oversimplified you ok
7:58 lmao!
Yay pork fan
It wasn't until a whole minute after the all-star lyric play on words that I realized "oh shit that was all-star"
I watched the part with Scott beating Harney about five times, I can't stop laughing over it
When we getting Vietnam?
Yay new oversimplified video it’s Christmas
Loving this new style.
I just kept screaming "YES!!" over and over again during the Canada segment at the end
Hahaha funny how Biden pop out ! What a Tool!
YES
You should make one about vietnam
Is it me or does Charles Griffith look strikingly similar to Tzar Nicholas II? (apologies to those who may made have pointed that out already!)
Me whenever I find out that a new oversimplified video has came out:  lol what the hell is a 'job'?
Oh my god that ending might be the best oversimplified moment ever😂
US : *tries to invade Canada and fails* Canada : sorry :(
Let’s go brandon!!!!
YES A NEW VIDEO
No sir, you watch your back... Don't make us burn down your precious "White House" again... We've been waiting DECADES for this chance boy... THE WORLD WOULD JOIN US! EVERYONE LOVES CANADIANS! Nobody loves americans other than americans... We will... Just give us the chance...
Yeehaw brother
Oh. Thats why people from Whatcom and Vancouver are called those things.
The return of the king        Of oversimplified history
29:02 probably the best sequence ever😂
my man just sufficiently covered three week's worth of content in my college class in almost half an hour
When I saw the thumbnail in recommendation, I thought it was made by someone else, bcz oversimplified didn't make an announcement for a new video. Then, I saw the channel name and was shocked.
:)
I wonder if Zapp Brannigan from futurama is a reference to general harvey or is it all american generals?
For you non-Americans, President Buchanan is generally considered the worst President of all time because he did absolutely nothing when the South began to secede to form the Confederacy.
33:30 love how Hunt was like: Jesus man where did he come from?
teacher: why are you laughing? Me: oh, nothing My brain: 4:11
Legend is baack
Incredible
Blame Canada! Blame CANADAAAAA!
The ending too good
31:35  Me: notices the pig has legs  Also me: wait that's illegal  Edit: forgot an s
canada: oooh we're shaking in our beaver boots
Let’s be honest, he made a 38 minute video just so he could express his feelings about Canada
Finally.
This is without a doubt my favorite YouTube channel
How was that 38 minutes? It felt like 10.
That Morgan Freeman cameo as the pig was really unexpected. Good job Oversimplified
I want whatever u took when u came up with that ending
All hits 0 misses
As a another mini war you should over simplifie The Winter war
It's always a good day when Oversimplified uploads
Here before 1 million
OMG YES
Make some videos on india and roast our cultural heritage 😭😢
Please 7 years war next
My 5 favorite moments from this channel: 5. The pig putting Lyman’s gun to his head 4. When everyone in Bologna was dancing around the bucket 3. The pig offering three wishes in Morgan Freeman’s voice 2. General Harney getting beaten mercilessly while screaming like he was in a horror movie 1. That unhinged rant about Canada
Yessss, finally
Keep it up
I liked the sheep part lol
I was not expecting that ending. Jesus.
If America ever invades Canada in my lifetime, I will be thinking of this video.
In an alternate universe, the Great San Juan War of 1859 kills over a million people.  The US wins, annexes Vancouver, and subjects Canadians to a humiliating treaty setting an unfavorable exchange rate between maple syrup and Kraft macaroni, and requiring all public schools to teach that the 26th letter of the alphabet is "zee" instead of "zed".  As consolation, Charles Griffin is given a new pig.
Me: I hope the next one is the Vietnam War or the 30 Years War Oversimplified: Makes a vid about some obscure quasi-war in Oregon that nobody's ever heard of.
Di the next video on the 6 days war
yessssss
That ending made my laugh my ass off 😄😄
Yes more oversimplified I been been waiting for this
Yea no way your taking Canada (I know your joking but still)
Please a video about the Ottoman Empire
hey oversimplified why don't you make video on Indian History their is a lot to explore
Im will wait to 2040 to see more video
It's beautiful that this video about a war that _almost_ started because of a pig is longer than the videos on both World Wars, Napoleonic Wars, Civil War, and the Revolutionary War.
Please don’t invade Canada. That is gonna be my escape country.
When the world needed him the most, he returned
The best ending in Oversimplified American History
I like how theres reference all star
My grandmother grew up on Shaw Island. My cousin and his family live on San Juan. It’s a really nice place to visit, but the ferry system is flawed.
If this video hit 500k in  5 day post a Vietnam war
It’s here. It’s a legend. What a legend.
I thought of being American but after watching that he'll no
7:32 sorry but this defind me when i see gringo
(Me and my friend while sharing chips) Me: straight line? Him: straight line
Do 7 year war pls
Update on the chronological timeline please?
Watch out Canada.
HES ALIVE
so, thats why bidon pulled all of his troops out of the middle-east, he needs them for the north
please make a video on insian batttle of tarrain
38:15 WW3 2022-2029

I liked this video it’s about where I live haha
When oversimplified becomes to patriotic : 37:10
I am an Indian
It has to be a good day with you uploading.
America and Canada has a lot of amazing land
Nord VPN.
In Russia NordVPN doesn't work . What should I do ?
I've never laughed so hard🤣🤣
This is honestly a work of art and comedy genius! Thanks so much Oversimplified I really appreciated this!
LMAO THEY CALLED TWO B-2 BOMBERS HAHAHA
Make a video about the 7 years war a war that changed the world forever: Nah Make a video about a war that started because of the shooting of a pig: Hell yeah
Nordvpn’s favorite sponsor guy!!!!
This is the most overcomplicated oversimplified video ever  and I love it
My Birthday is Complete Because of your Upload :)
Over Simplified can change the history of Youtube
bro Canada is the homie of the U.S they have the special bro pass
18:18 is how Russians are
Yeah im just gonna wait some 6 month long again to see this channel again 🙂
17:35 Confused Australian wondering what rooting has to do with eating potatoes.
Jizzingham ayo 😳
The last minute rant was the greatest thing I have ever seen in my life
Instead of waiting 5 months for a new video you could try and remake some of your of old videos like your world war 1 And world war 2 videos it might just sound like an easy way to get views but that was just and idea I had in mind
Viva La   Manifest Destiny Vivat manifestum Parcae  Vive la Destinée Manifeste
.
Canadian people:  Dude, uncool!
So happy to see a video about my local history! I’ve grown up in Whatcom County and the Pig War has always kinda been a local joke. It’s rare to hear of people outside the Pacific Northwest who know about it.
Someone remembered that he has a YouTube channel........
The animation is so freaking SMOOTHHH
How funny I grew up in Whatcom county 🤣
Oh my god how did i miss this upload
37:19 Free American Empire has changed their diplomatic status: Declare War
A NEW VIDEO FROM OVERSIMLIFIED AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
37:18 this is the greatest patriotic speech of all time
america gay
The ending was so funny bro that was genuinely hilarious
What is going on with you😂😂😂😂
When i first saw the title i thought of technoblade
"These white people sure love beavers!"  Don't we all buddy 4:43
Dmn boy he's back
Do one on Chinese history next. I feel there’s a lot of Oversimplified History to be explained there.
U S EH?
Another great vid
I'd dearly imagine Drake being the president, let alone Oversimplified acting such a drunkard after drinking 15 Molson Canadians.
I’ve never felt more patriotic in my life then the ending when I’m not even American
that ending... lmao epic
Funny how Pickett was with the US Army, knowing in a few years he would switch sides to the Confederacy.
even the adds are fun to watch when he makes it
Do poland
Oh god I lost it when the McDonald’s and bombers entered the fray xD
Yeah screw Canada
yes at last a new video
It sounded like you had a lot of fun with this one, and as a Canadian this was a real treat.
Vote oversimplified for prezz  2024
As an Oregonian, I’m so proud he pronounced Oregon right (everyone says it like “Oregone” for some reason. It’s pronounced “Oregun”)
letsssssssss gooooooooooooo
That ending literally had me in tears hahahahahaha! I LOVE YOU OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!... XD
When does the Vietnam War video come out that you promised?
37:08 the most American ending I have ever seen look out Canada, look out curling and hockey
I have a feeling this is going to get demonetized.
The big war
Ps: VIVA LA PATRIOTISM we shall take Canada   we shall unite Alaska with the other states  the state of Montreal shall Exist!
Canada has Nukes
I f**king love you OverSimplified.
very informal. but for the first time in watching a Oversimplified video, i ask, what the hell just happened
Wow this is interisting for canada and usa but  i like to see it
lol cannada
Many of you misunderstand what Manifest Destiny is. Manifest means apparent, or obvious. Destiny is what will happen, or fate. Manifest Destiny is what’s obviously going to happen. Is it right?  Americans believed that it was apparent that they would stretch from coast to coast. Well, it’s pretty obvious that we did in fact expand to the Pacific Ocean. So yes, Manifest Destiny is correct.
Guys FINALLY!!!!
Can You Do A Philippine-American War (1899-1913) Video Pls
Is it just me or does the pig look like waddles from Gravity Falls?
I love how NordVPN shows up out of nowhere... I cant be even mad of the ad transition.
now it's internet historians turn
vietnam war
It feels like forever since the last video
You need to remember 1973?
best video EVER!!!
Man, how does he do it? Each video better than the last, each time learning something I already thought I knew. This dude is an absolute legend and quite possibly the King of educational YouTube videos.
No no no no no I think Biden is coming with dementia
Oink Oink
Also the Ending Is Epic i loved it so Much your Videos are the Best  every time you post a Video i Treat it as the Greatest Video of all time my Favorite video of yours is Prohibition i have a suggestion for your next Video ( 7 Years War )  most people haven't even heard of La Salle or the 7 years war we need a video on it! also we should take Canada we have the rights guns arms  means motives superiority and much more though that would be a violation of the founding of the United Nations as the United Nations was supposed to be a end to  war conflict but since North Korea still exists and  threatens countries i guess  we haven't quite achieved that
"Straight line?" "Straight line."
This guy is the best at history
3:52 nobody else hear Bill O’Reilly?
les wait really long again :)
I have been waiting for this
algorythm
Lets Go Brandon!
finally an upload
Canadians in the videos after so much demanding . The Indians be like -It's our turn now!!
Yo someone check on Canada and make sure they are okay after that ending 🤣🤣🤣
christmas has come a bit too early a good video to end off with this shit of a year
Finally oversimplified uploads
When I see a new carti dropped 😐 When I see a notie from oversimplified ☺️☺️
This was an absolute treat
That Americana ending really turned me off. Nationalism is dumb. I really enjoyed it up to that point. Extreamly funny satire especially on the British takes. Just please don't do that extreamly American move again.
Love how these videos keep getting longer
Your videos are getting better and better. Do something about the Chinese Civil War, or Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward or Cultural Revolution.
27:25 LMAO
i want a face reveal
The single best Chanel on YouTube
The end got me 😂😂😂😂😂
Thank god he posted today because im losing my mind in this pandemic
America is great and it never did anything wrong for the time 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
16:30 when Americans hear the word “oil”...
Canada is in NORTH AMERICA for a reason baby
That's a poor person Darren! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is by far one of the most American things I’ve ever heard
Only 11 minutes in, but looking at the maps he's showing, they look more like they're part of the British Victoria Island
This is the best video yet. Oversimplified is one of the greatest youtubers and his videos age so well. KEEP IT UP.   Also, yes, watch out Canada. Manifest Destiny is comin and papa Biden is leading the charge with a VENGEANCE!!!!
4:12  Certified Murica moment  Spreading Freedom and Democracy since 1776
Omggggg a new oversimplified vid about techno
Yea, invade Canada and see what happens.  empires who try to take the Icelandic hell scape from those who already live their for generations only find the snow and death. ask everyone who conquered Russia.
I thought this was going to be a video on the hattfields and McCoys, because surprise surprise, the death of a pig almost caused another major conflict.
Uploaded 5 hours ago... oh boy I'm early!  14K comments already haha 😂🤣
I absolutely love how overly exaggerated something's of these videos are. I absolutely love your content. ( I have learned more about history from watching your videos then i ever did throughout school. I forgot to say, yes they are a bit absurd yet always worth the watch.
No hate but why does that plushie look like it would kill someone in a horror movie?
Best ending hahaha
who voiced the pig?? morgen freemen
The pig being possessed by Morgan Freeman is topnotch lmfao
I am Canadian and at the end I was more scared of joe Biden then Canadian geese
New vid pog

NOOOOOOO DONT INVADE CANADA
Damn this video went from 0 to 60 real quick..

Biden has a bird’s brain considering what happened in Afghanistan, do you honestly think he could handle an invasion of Canada?
Ah yes, George Pickett
YO! HE'S BACK
Finally !!!!
It's always a national holiday when he posts
YES, A VIDEO, AFTER 6 MONTHS!

Anyone else heard of when Irish immigrants started their own government in the US and then tried invading Canada (British owned) and hoped the US would back them?  Maybe this time, we will back them.
Lol
33:29 my sides fucking went into orbit xD
Bring it on USA
Another great video
the surprise vpn ad broke me xD
For the manifestation of our destiny, we need to get this man in office. NOW.
It’s cool to see those rare moments when the sides get along  Now… let’s invade Canada
is it wierd that I was scared watching this video

YEEEEEEESSSSS WERE COMING FOR YOU CANADA
Best OverSimplified ever form a Canadian
Sad that oversimplified never talked about Point Roberts when mentioning the border dispute with Washington
Not the ending I expected.. As a Canadian, I think we'll be just fine.
finally after 5 months.
Gonna listen to all stars today
Great Video! *Interesting Topic! I love all the fun comedy and effort you put into these hilarious videos!*
Gotta love how you call the mountains "the Rockies". Defenitly using that
I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time he uploads
Such hilarious history lesson 😂
Can’t wait for the next one in 6 months
This was the BEST oversimplified video so far! I laughed so much during this video. Good job to everyone involved in the creation of this masterpiece.
finally another quality video

This guy made me fall in love with history. Plz also make videos on Indian history. It is full of Smart powerful kings and stupid officials 😉.
4:08 The real American way of expansion
Ya'll already know that someones gonna make a gender out of that plushie
Alr... the ending was not like the other....
This whole episode seems like it was going to left turn into a history matters style "fun fact: no" at any moment
man i wish you uploaded more... this is quality content
As a Canadian thank you for this video 🇨🇦
As a native who learned about the French - British Native trading agreement 2 years ago, I laughed when one of the natives said “These white people sure love beavers”
Do people really complain that Oversimplified doesn't mention Canada enough?
in truth, they were german
Invade us and I’ll personally take you out myself
Lets Go best Youtber Is back!!!!!!  Tysm For the vidoe hope youll make more
Ah finally a new one as i was just thinking about Oversimplified a day ago, great timing!! Keep doing at what you do best man!
Yes! The legend is back

This video makes me wish USA didn't exist.
Is the War of the Roses next?  Please let it be the War of the Roses that’s next…
I am full on ready to invade Canada after that glorious speech
Omg man thanks for posting again your videos make my day better
I wish bro uploaded more he should hire people
Well I think all the people who have watched this video just had their opinion  changed on Canada.
That thumbnail... is SO epic, that I want to take a screenshot and set it as my desktop wallpaper.
If Orcas Island were to have been a British territory, my childhood would have been waaaay different.
the End of the Oversimplified was a good Balenced Mix Of Cringe and Patriotism i shall call it either Patriocringe or cringiotism we Salute you OverSimplified!
I m from viet nam
So how did Canada get independence from Britain?
5:56, That line was perfect.
We wait for a long time
dude i like ur content, just can you make a oversimplified version of anything related to indian history?
If he takes too long to upload a video, that means a good video will be uploaded in 5 or 6 months.
Finally after 6 months A new video.
The white guilt is strong in here.
Low-key scared me with the end😂
I have got a feeling that 5-10 years from now, you will be making an oversimplified  video of the Sino-Indian-American-Pakistani war.
Oversimplified.... I think the war took less time than this video
What the hell happened at the end
being an American he emerged with 4 pistols and a giant knife           wow to balls on this man
So it is so old thing take US people will pull out guns for any reason
You should do OverSimplified: The Gilded Age.
So fun to see an OF video about my lil home! Despite hearing this story over and over growing up I learned quite a lot! Thanks OF.   Biden’s coming, baby!
The legend is back
Oh, a new episode. It's about 🐖?  Ok
finally
As a Canadian the last 2 minutes had me quite literally snorting with laughter
Nord vpn
Ladies and gentlemen, he’s back
37:14 USA USA
Well you forgot about the UK mate
This angered General Scott who punished Harney severely
Looks like Christmas came early eh
yes it’s another oversimplified video man watching french revolution and emu war over and over again was getting old
FINALLY ANOTHER UPLOAD BY THE MAN HIMSELF
Nearly coughed my lungs out from laughing so hard at the ending 😂
HYPE FOR NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO
In this video, you will witness OverSimplified's true colors (*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)
Sometimes I learn something new about my country and I genuinely can't believe that I'm sitting in America and that we've made it this far. 😂
When we needed him most, he came
Oversimplified should do a Philippine-American War even though the Philippines lost it is still a great story
Babe wake up oversimplified just uploaded a new video
YES!!! A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO!!
37:08 to the end had me dying 😂
10:02 England, rather than fight a useless war, were the adults in the room and let us have the straight line we so desired. To thank them we decided to be extremely petty and fight for a few small islands? How very American of us.
America the big
No America and Canada are brothers you must a CSA American
The production quality of these videos have *IMMENSELY* increased
The humor in this video is as crazy as the history of this situation itself.
37:12 Leave it to oversimplified to make a amazing speech on why Canada can be invaded by the US
HE"S BACK
These videos give me a reason to keep living
“Just as God intended!” *EYYYYYY!* *guns everything down, builds railroads, has McDonalds and uses planes for more effect*
Wow I had no idea this happened, what a way to be told
Return of the king, keep uploading dude
It’s  pronounced what come. Close enough 😂
Finally!!!
Timestamps of Americans being Americans 4:03 7:24 16:27
The woke undertones of this video are super subtle. Well done.
Canada is actually one of the most difficult countries to invade
Last time I was this early my dad was still here
its been so long since he has uploaded a video
This storytelling is getting out of hand man 🤣i like the sheep conversation bits. 10/10 video.
hey fort vancouver! i live 30 minutes from there!
Buchanan!!!!
Biden: now that’s not a bad idea
the pigs look like Waddles from Gravity Falls
8:49 That’s the true American Spirit right there
*"HOPPED IN THEIR WAGONS AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING"*
So basically Harney was from Florida, right?
Oversimplified has come so far since the Henry the Eighth video. Every one has gotten better and better. Great job if you somehow are seeing this comment P.S) The end was so unexpected, but I love it
This man is a true patriot, wanting to invade Canada to manifest our destiny. I salute you sir
NGL, it's kind of ironic how the whole thing began with Americans wanted to tax the Brits on those islands. You know, the same Americans who fought a revolutionary war and established a whole new country because they didn't want to pay taxes.
Mom wake up OverSimplified posted!
Ok
Please do Texas Revolution next.
You somehow turned a small war into a interesting thing
the ending sent me 😭
If you invade our country, we won't hesitate to burn your White House down. You all know we _can_ do it, we just have to want to.
As a Canadian, it really doesn’t matter. It’s too expressive to live near the coast anyway. Also, yes, i am scared of Joe Biden...
There is some good money to be made in this Canadian invasion.  Look up what a barrel of Canadian maple syrup is in comparison to a  barrel of oil.  Just sayin
Manifest Destiny 2.0 Canada First!
Ahhhh I’ve been waiting so long for another video!!!!
Haha I didn't know Oversimplified was gonna upload today :D
we shall fight hard with our twenty three soldiers mounted on polar bears and moose with hockey sticks!
The start was so weird
I waited till my dinner was ready so I could watch this video while eating
Ah yes old Louisiana was so thicc
these oversimplified thumbnails get better and better
So I live in Victoria and this pleases me to no end! Thank you so much :D I live in Sooke, I can literally see where my house is -gleeful clapping-   Also the Pig War is one of the coolest and most under-rated border conflicts ever
Finaly a new video
This is gonna be a rant but, I’m tired of people just getting away with portraying the Americans as some invading force oppressing the Indians. (I will call them Indians cause that’s what they wanna be called) Cause in reality, it was Indians oppressing Indians and other Indians oppressing them and, the the Indians migrate to some different places and repeat.  The Americans where simply another group coming in with a goal to take the land. Except the Americans had the manpower, will and, guns to enforce their claims permanently.   For the people asking for America to be returned to the Indians, what the hell are you asking for? Anarchy to return? Pre-historic political borders? What makes the Indians so special? Why stop there? Let’s just go down the slippery slope and say genocide people for the sake of the environment. See where this line of thinking leads? Utter insanity.  This is how all the land in history was exchanged between groups. Same with the pig war.  If you see anyone claiming give Indian land back or anything like this, tell them their stupid and be about your day.
General Scott commanded the campaign that led to the capture of Mexico City. The Duke of Wellington even declared that Scott was the greatest general of the immediate post-napoleonic era. He’s a criminally underrated soldier, and the fact that he had to sort this incident out makes this mess even more hilarious. It would be like if Douglas MacArthur had to deal with a TPing incident.
Please give us every day history story or something like that
Nice video oversimplified!
Wait how did you get morgan freeman to do the pig?
go for president
The Tommy Guns unfortunately are not historically accurate
Me, a Canadian watching the last minute of the video: *nervous sweating*
HE UPLOADED?!?!
omg ive been dying for ww3 but this ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ok OverSimplified tell me how did you though of making this funny part  33:29
“You’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you’re an idiot, you guys are fine, and you two are the most mind-numbingly brain-dead ding-dongs I’ve ever encountered in all my life, and I’ll see you in my office!” I loved these lines 32:32 😂
Ya more like Biden is coming to get impeached
as a washingtonian you naming san juan island is kinda a spoiler lol
He’s so fucking expressive in this video and I love it!
I too, love Beaver
I learned about this incident almost 6 months ago and I was literally wondering why no major historical YouTuber had covered it, especially Oversimplified. A dispute over a pig’s death literally caused an international incident!
That ending was fing hilarious and I loved the Wayne Gretzky part and Biden
Babe wake up oversimplified just posted
Not so fast there, oversimplified. Last time America went to war with Canada the Devil invaded Earth.
Technoblade never dies
OH YES ANOTHER VIDEO THIS IS GREAT YAYAYAYA
Ok oversimplified you should have used more guns for the Americans
You deserve a Nobel Prize.
Pog
Kinda sad that I'm I'm  diffrent time.e zone so this dropped at like 3 am for me
We should own Canada
Lol jokes on you we have the geese.
38 mins? This isn't oversimplified, it's just simplified
Well now, those last few minutes just blew my mind 🤣🤣🤣
Your content is legendary.
I was so not ready for that ending buy by GOD WAS IT INCREDIBLE!!!!!! USA USA USA USA
A video!!! Yess!!!
Hey take the rest of Canada all you want, just leave Quebec alone, they don't want us either anyway
Cristams Came Early!
Man, this episode had me laughing.
Love how at the end he turns into the spiffing brit.... or the uh... charming American?
You are joking about the Canada thing but i am dead serious why not do it we r the undisputed strongest fighting force, it is currently 11:48pm and by 1.00am tomorrow morning we would be celebrating a job well done
Finally a new vid
This is the best oversimplified video over- the end is choice!
Yay! A new post!!! Btw I wanna know if oversimplified has more Indian viewers
Why was the ending so passionate. I honestly felt the patriotism leak through my device and into my American soul.
38:15 Joe mama's son is coming baby
That was some neat animation before your declaration of war there
The Oversimplified Plushie looks like an uncompleted Snowman... I love it!
The G.O.A.T is back
Oh so good... 👌 Totally worth the 6 months. Thank you so much! Merica Baby!
Christmas came early this year , thank you oversimplified for this amazing and educative video . Thanks 😀
OMG A NEW VIDEO
7:56 “...but the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming.” “Hopped in their wagons and hit the ground running.”  What a tune 🎶💃🏼
AFTER 6 MONTHS
i was the 500th person here
good to see u back dud
UK: So What Border You Want For Agreements? US: *STRAIGHT LINES*
the ending there was the most jokingly-genuine and threatening tone from oversimplified i ever heard bro LOL
This is so good
Me a Canadian: oh
Finally 30 years of wait pays off
Petition for OverSimplified as President, WE WANT CANADA!,WE WANT WAYNE GRETZKY!,THERE POPULATION IS PATHETICALLY SMALL!,CANADA YOU WONT LAST FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS!
Drake? Lmao does Canada and USA like young girls?
MAKE A VIDEO ON THE INDIAN INDIPENDENCE STRUGGLE
14:36-14:52 That gave me a huge laugh, thank you
I would love to see a video on the Korean War
As a Canadian, I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry watching that ending
Seriously dude, Maple syrup will always be Canadian! CANADIAN PROUD!!!! (except that we are horribly racist) but please make a Canada one, I would be so grateful. I mean come on. Also, look how far this channel has come over the years. Can you believe how much that quality has improved? I'm a long-time subscriber and honestly have been watching these videos over and over again, hoping for new content every day.
Ура! Новый видосик. Жду озвучку
Best 38 minutes and 43 seconds of my life
i just watched you in history lmao. keep up the good work!
You captain Hornby My brain: removes b in less then 2 seconds
LMAO that ending was the best thing ever seen all year
Me still waiting for a Vietnam war oversimplified … also I’m Canadian
*fastest click in the west…*
Why did u not make a vid since like 1728? by the way no offence but great vid!
Today on topics I didn’t know I wanted to learn

Ah yes finally our oversimplified for the next 4 months
"Join the Pork Side."
Это комментарий для продвижения видео от канала Oversimplified.
O damn, was Just thinking about you. Suddenly u appear. Fantastic!
Hot damn, Oversimplified early Christmas gift   Merry Christmas you sonavubitch
This is a certified classic
This is almost 40 mins of video is one of the most American video, I had ever saw.
Okay, we should leave Canada alone thanks
you know hes running out on wars when he talks about the pig war edit: just read the title and commented immediatly i have no idea what its about lol
A new OverSimplified episode? A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Talk more about Japan. I’ll take anything from how the Sengoku Period ended, the Meiji Restoration or the history of the JSDF.
Wtf even was the outtro 😂 😂 😂
Poor pig 🐷
Lol finally
I started watching Napoleonic Wars video again yesterday and was wondering when would your next video come out. What a surprise for this morning!
Please post more!!
Do not come...
Oh my lawd new video
You have really outdone yourself especially with the end of the video
37:47 FUCK YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
did anyone else see the drake for president email at 6:30, caught it the second time through
This might be the best video on the internet
Didn’t know the call OverSimplified could ever talk and sound like that
I can spiritually relate to this video
Ya and we kicked there butts. WOOO CANADA YAA UNDEFEATED
wouldn't be surprised if Biden fumbled us into a war with Canada at this point.
BABE BABE COME QUICK huh? NEW OERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO LESSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oversimplified Vietnam War?
LESSSSGOOO OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOAD
37:11 this is just fallouts universe
careful oversimplified you dont wanna look like general harney now do you  I cant stop laughing oh my god
oh my GOD NEW AYAYYAYYAYA
i wonder if he'll do the blackhawk war next?
This one is a gift from the gods the end part tho
I wish I could resolve many of my problems with a straight line.
21:20 Apparently , by the Music , The General must be a 'Predator' in disguise ..........
"But being an American he emerged from his tent with 4 pistols and a giant knife".... this made me so proud to be an American...
Oversimplifiex - spanish american war or korean war when?
I'm curious to see if Oversimplified ever branches out into the fantasy category and does breakdowns for like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I think mixing that in with the real stuff would provide a nice balance and continue the creativity
Anyone wanna go restart the fight over the islands with me so America can conquer Canada?
I know what the u.s. is going to do soon takeover candidate and go for the entirety of South America next
4:12 Shout out to that dude who carried the Mcdonald's.
31:00 Was that freaking Morgan Freeman??!!!?
You might not post frequently but the content is quality
U.S.A: Well if the middle east doesn't work out, there is always Canada. Canada: That's a joke right? U.S.A: ... Canada: That's a joke...right???
This was absolutely amazing. Stellar work as always! :)
3:35 The placement of the legs is just beautiful
Well...I'm just gonna wait here until the U.S. Canadian invasion starts and then we can blame you know who.
Are we just not gonna talk about the ending?
Technoblade origin story
Best animation yet
I can tell you had fun making this one 🤣 I always laugh at your vids but this one, I couldn't breathe 😂🤣😂
he finally uploaded
Omg that ending
DOWN WITH THOSE EXTREMELY NICE MAPLE SYRUP DRINKING FOOLS
ANNEX CANADA
I love this video
"And who was it that spoke to God?" "I hear voices all the time." 3:54
Me when oversimplified:WOOOOOHHH YEAAA BAYYYY WHOOOOIOOOO
POG new upload
I never knew perfection existed until this video's last bit
So shocked by how energized he gets, such power, such overly oversimplified, loved the ending 😂
He’s back!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!
Really says a lot about American public schools that this is the first I ever heard of this.
Why did that canada rant at the end make me so patriotic?
God bless the americans.
finally !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love your work. But may i suggest more videos on history from countries outside USA and Europe. Because we get them a lot anyways.
Son of a bitch, i'm in
would you make a video on native Americans perspective?
37:17 as someone who has his flag a copy of US, I will support this lol
37:20 This sheer amount of Patriotism is enough for both Philippines and Cuba just give our islands just to shut his yaps up. And I would definitely agreed for him.
US and UK in a nutshell: *Give land, get invaded, get invaded, get smacked: OH NO A WAR: Thats fine, get invaded, A WAR, economy be bussin*
Me after watching the ending: oh Canada....😳
finally
There is no great American history moment if you don't mention guns 🇺🇸🤠
this vid has a over a thousand dislikes if your wondering lol
**fear**
Was that Morgan Freeman voicing that pig in the woods?
I'm  Canadian howw dare u
Well done, amazing job this was a masterpiece and now my favorite oversimplified video
Selamün aleyküm babbaa
your animation of fort vancouver looks suspiciously like the russian colonial fort ross in northern california.
Im leaving this comment here until it gets to a million views
You returned

Nothing like classic american ethnic clensing 😍
Production really skyrocketed
wake up oversimplified posted 😳
7:57 All Star reference 🤪😳😳
*Before the Pig* *Pig* *Military Escalation* - Wikipedia
aight boys here's the plan.. arm all CF-18 with air to ground payloads and hit the USA's nearest airports and airfields real hard. We move the 7th armoured division from Ontario all the way to Washington, and burn down the white house again for shits and giggles. we get our friends in the royal navy to blockade any incoming shipments. we starve the American armies and government while liberating the people. giving them affordable health care. Instantly making their houses worth almost quadruple (I'm not even lying, my mediocre 1,500 sq. ft. house in Toronto is worth $1,800,000 USD)   lowering legal drinking age to 19, and giving them all the legal weed they want nation wide. 72 hour invasion. For affordable health care! for affordable tuition! For valuable housing! For being old enough to drink legally with your buds! for that good kush eh! we owe this to these soon to become Canadians, we must share!
Wake up babe, new Oversimplified video
Imagine invading Canada because OverSimplified is semi-encouraging it. 🤠😈🤠😈
Mmmooorrreee vvviiidddeeeooosss.
fake canada isn't real
"Well then you my friend should use NORDVPN" Hahahaha
Canada - It gets to -40 to -50 degrees in most parts up here in the Winter. Murica - Yea, forget it, it's yours. Canada - WE WON A GREAT WAR!
When the world needed him the most he came back
The ending was truly hilarious
*winfield scott was the half baked originator*
31:00 *Casually somehow loads an already loaded shell into a double barrel shotgun*
OMG, I am in splits!
Hallelujah! A Oversimplified Upload!
Yay he is backing
As a Canadian, the end was great.

Christmas came early, yay

Wasn’t expecting that ending- I’m just gonna chill down south in Australia-
Let's go oversimplified taking over Canada is an amazing idea.
Could you make an oversimplified video about gustav adolfus and the 30 years war

" I am the watcher, I am your guide through these vast new realities, follow me and ponder the question....36:59"
Holy shit !!!…… todays a good day
Why you make this instead the 1812
You forgot aboot Canada eh
Ok as some who is from Canada I would actually want to know how would the war between the two north American countries go.
Every single video he releases is better than the last. Love it
Can you do Croatian war for independence from 1991 to 1995
I'm crying of happiness over a new release
"killed your pig"!!
3:40 when other civilization did it, it's 'great'. When USA did it, it's rat, or disease. Ok, got it.
Babe, Oversimplified Posted!  Yes, Babe
"if you strike me down I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine" ---Pig
His back
I was waiting for the ad for some war game at the end. And yeah screw you Canada
YAYYY
Finally he is back after 6 months
Watching that last part, we can safely say that Oversimplified = Harney's successor.
Finally
Vietnam war should be next
A blessing from the lord
You captain Hornby My brain: *removes b in less then 2 seconds*
I get excited whenever I see you’ve posted a video😁
Vietnam War wen?
Basically, Oversimplified is Overwhelming to put that ending, because YT removed the Dislike counts. What an American way to never get offended from Canadian Viewers.
Hey this came out on my b-day
Any Canadians or Brits in the comment section want to restart this dispute?
Wait what does he mean by hes coming
As a Canadian I fear this. But if u guys do  invade us dw we have an army of Canadian Geese on standbye.
Finally he uploaded 👌👌
I feel like he just made this video to just flex how talented he is
We will always be your loyal capitalist oversimplified 😊
That “Biden’s coming baby!” Part was too good
When we needed him most, he returned
It’s been too long my simplified friend. Good to see ya back
Honestly I want him to do the Punic Wars especially the destruction of Carthage. He is of the opinion that Carthage should be destroyed
Thanks for making this video Bc i just messed around in google maps for about half an hour and realized that the British made 100mile long train tunnels underwater to connect islands to the mainland. I wish I was joking, look in transit
We need a Vietnam war video… (Just an idea)
epic
Do a history of Canada
I fing love this video so much
Best oversimplified video yet
pog
31:01 WHAAAT!? 😂
A long long time no see
Oh , pig war eh
Pog
Finally
It’s all fun and games till us Canadians call upon the wrath of the Canadian geese ask the Germans they experienced it in the Netherland
Comment for the algorithm
I love how the entire situation just became a British Karen getting repeatedly trolled by American settlers
YESSSS INVADE CANADA!!
Oversimplified. I have a great idea for your next video: (Plz don’t take this the wrong way I say this with full love for your work and channel)  Do a four part episode of the Chinese Revolution From the Decline of the Qing all the way to 1949 with establishment of PRC or beyond! It would be epic  Again, love your work and say this with full support to your channel.
So happy another video is out
That last sequence made my blood go red white and blue, not gonna lie. Not interested in invading Canada, but that was a rush.
"congrats who is early and found this comment 🏆"
Griffin go4
Oh my God I've been waiting for a new video and lord knows I was not disappointed lmao. I hope he posts more often
“America tried to invade Canada, and the British ended up burning down the White House. But it was essentially a draw”  Spoken like a true American
Let’s be honest, we never want a face reveal.
The War of 1812 really was a hot wash, wasn't it?
POG
That all star reference tho
37:20 Oversimplified just went full patriotism of the US.
as a canadian, i love that final bit <3
You don't have to talk about Canada if it is part of America ;)
Omfg you are back finally!!!!
CANADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm sorry but that ending was just sooo hilarious I can't stop laughing like mad
I love his depiction of President Buchanan. The man almost single handedly lead to southern  succession and when he knew he royally screwed up, he was like, "meh, that's the next guy's problem"
That ending was really weird, even for you.
good video
Yay, uploadsss I mean upload
Can a da
I'm going to say it right now ---> OverSimplified your videos are SO entertaining. Please, add --> -The conquest of the Americas -The Mongols -Kievan and Moscovy Rus independence / how Rus became Russia or splits etc (i would like to learn more about this tbh) -The hundred year war if possible -Spanish Tercio tactics transitioning into Swedish modern warfare tactics by Gustavus Adolphus -and more <3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3

CANADA
Oh my fucking god, welcome back man
Canada!
I felt real pain when I saw Wayne wearing the Stars and Stripes
Too many jokes this time. Not sure if I want to watch the next one.
Finaly update
God your videos are so great
The greatest final one and half minutes of a video in all of human history.
Okay, but let’s actually do the Canada thing
hey you posted so late man
Canada needs some freedom
7:57 nice all-star reference
FINALLY OVERIMPLIFIED UPLOADS
If you want a conflict that did (kinda) start with a pig, then you should do the Hatfield McCoy feud. As a direct descendant of Devil Ance Hatfield, the story is pretty incredible.
37:09 Time stamp for my future self to come back for repeat helpings of that glorious ending and its heaping freedom 🦅
Hey oversimplified! you have a lot of followers from Mexico! we would love to see either one of our major armed conflicts portrayed and oversimplified by you! here are some options  1The spanish Conquista 2 Mexican war of independance 3 Mexican revolucion
god i love this channel
yeah America was thinking it was meant to be the entire continent there was no chance in hell that would have worked out lol  also dat ending XD
Do a George Bush video or 9/11!
lmao all americans want is mcdonalds
biden would never invade Canada the Whole left is trying to copy their Tyranical Laws and make them american. Democrats need to be removed from office or this country is going to find itself in a new civil war. where its the Left vs America.
Hes back
ok we got emu war, football war, bucket war, and now pig war I wonder if there is a war about giraffe? or maybe tuna?
Babe, wake up, a new OverSimplified video just dropped
please make a video on English Europe middle ages
33:04 XD
Didn't see that ending coming
Canada whips out a staircase  Biden “Not today”
Nice 👍
As a Canadian. Im scared…
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
I love your videos
woah woah woah those last few minutes is every Canadians nightmare
Today is a good day!
It's been so long since u uploaded yes!!!!!!
im saddened by the loss of  mr berky
God Bless that last bit hahah. This might be the first time I’d ever heard you shout like that haha
Oversimplified just ruined USA-Canada relations
i feel like this video was made entirely to make that ending.
Canadian: "Man I'm sure glad out two countries  are at peace and have enjoyed our prosperous open boarders and free trade." American: "Yeah..." *Licks lips* " Peace... Prosperous..." Canadian: "You ok eh?" American: "Yeah man... Just thinking... About some stuff.  We could be the biggest strongest most self reliant nation on the planet..." Canadian: "Wait you're not thinking of annexing us are you?" American: "No need... you'll join eventually." Canadian: "What do you me-" Albertan: "Hey bud soory to do this to ya but we're leaving and joining the US. We're just tired of them folks in Ottawa messing up our lives. You understand don'tcha bud?" Manitobain Saskatchewanian and British Colombian: "We're going with him eh."  Canadian: "No..." American: "Oh say can you see?"  *Slowly pulls out his guns* "BY THE DAWNS EARLY LIGHT!"
That Canada speech was the most impassioned we’ve ever heard from Oversimplified and I think I love it
I absolutely love these videos. All of them are so we'll done. So happy to see more coming.
I’m Canadian and currently terrified. There’s no saying what oversimplified is capable of.
Let's go Brandon
I must say, I really wasn’t expecting Pickett to show up. But I am very glad I know this about him.
Time to wait half a year for the next one! :,)
Over wether the US-Canada border looked like this or like this😂
Oversimplified videos that would be sick Vietnam War Chinese Revolution European colonization of Africa 7 years war  100 years war  War on terror  Desert Shield/Storm Mexican American War Texan Revolution Iran-Iraq war
Well.  That was an unexpected twist.
I'm all for expanding the USA to encompass all of America!
I mean I like Canada I do but if we ever get the urge to manifest some destiny…
EARLY !!!!! He uploads ever 6 months to 1   Year ! 5 hours is considered early
Do a video on india pakistan they went to war 4 times

H Y P E
Does anyone know the song playing at 16:30 ?
We would just invade from Alaska because barely anything out in that part of canada except oil and gas potential and -30 degree summer days. Invade sue for peace.
I've said it once I'll say it again. Full-scale nuclear armageddon must befall Canada. They have had it too good for too long.
Hi
(4 hours ago) I'm early! 😃😄
It's always a good day when there is a new Oversimplified!  I only wish that you were a machine and could make them faster.  Keep up the good work anyway!
"Tell me, viewer. Which channel is it referring to?" The one with water in it, duh.
I sure do love sabbath black.
31:36 I'm fucking dead.
Man that was a great video! this might be my favourite oversimplified video yet.
Got the notification alert from Oversimplified and I'm here🤩🤩😁
Oversimplified is posted video once in life but long and entertained
“babe come back to bed” “can’t. new oversimplified”
Yay oversimplified
You're alive!
I would like to ask if you would do some more older wars like greece and persia or the great conquest of macedon or mongolians just a query

Anyone else catch the spice girls lyrics at 30:39
Anyone seen the movie Canadian bacon
So i am American the ending was funny 😂🤣so remember our Canadian Friends its just a joke. We already tried in 1812 and never again. I have Canadian friends that joke about this all the time.
Something you’ve kinda skipped over is why Canada never sided/ merged with America
From WW1 all the way to the pig war. What a man. Hes definitely gonna be remember as one of the best youtubers of our time
That smash mouth reference was unexpected
That moment when he said I hate I always hated you will beating the shit out of him is the most funniest shit I ever see in my fuck life😂😹 HAHAHAHAHA I spam a hour laughing a shit here we go again
Biden’s doing what🤨
“I love economic proxy wars”

37:17 Happens Me, an American: **salutes with a single tear rolling down my eye while looking off into the distance in the name of freedom**
Oversimplified has the most American Accent I've heard in my life on the ending 💀💀
INVADE CANADA!
Cuz of the terrain
OverSimplified have only gotten better.
Bad news Canada is hard to invade
As A Canadian, I can not wait to embrace our new American Subjects uwu
Biden sucks republican all the way
37:00 Well played, well played…
My IP was once banned from editing Wikipedia for continually adding "The Pig" under the section for notable figures...
29:00 XD
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIT
Finally! It seems like it’s been so long, such good shit
Another bomb dropped by oversimplified 🤩
Nice rant at the end
MORGAN FREEMAN IS THE PIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GODFATHER
Iraq war when
Everytime OverSimplified post something it feels like a blockbuster movie.
All right you blood hell canadiens run back to england beacause america is ganna colonies your land that pee on your pants at night sorry if i was mean but its a joke
In the end instead of saying “he’s coming. He’s coming with a vengeance!” U shoulda said “he’s coming.And he’s coming H A R D!” 😂😂

Welp it's official. The war of 1812 was a draw.
Can you make a Alexander Hamilton oversimplified
Holy oversimplified outta nowhere
Finally a new video 😂❤
War propaganda against Canada??
As a Canadian, I can say I learnt NONE of this in school. Why weren't we taught this stuff? Also the ending was hilarious beyond measure, it was perfection and I'm not even offended. Just one thing...   y'all taking the poutine too?
Pls do Vietnam War or Korean War.
are you guys in america really eat mcdonalds all day, all have advanced weaponry and pistols and are fat
My dad is a British and my mother is an American and we live on the San Juan Islands. Yeah! Family gatherings are great....
Interesting. The Civil War video made Scott out to be weak and indecisive. This one redeems him
oh my god, OVERSIMPLIFIED IS BACK!, HE IS ALIVE!, jokes aside i srsly wanna appreciate you man.
Me at the ending as a Canadian: Oh my god… you’ve lost so many brain cells, haven’t you thought of the power we posses! Ha! What a fool… You dare underestimate the power… THE POWER WE POSSES! …Maple… Syrup.
I think the Pig is a Sith Lord.
Is it me or does William S. Harney sounds a lot like Donald Trump? 20:16
Wow I was gonna say where were my early people at but dang, already 13K comments just a few hours in. You’ve really made yourself OS
"The only casualty was just a pig" Those potatoes: *forgotten*

OverSimplified  completes my soul I need 100 plushies
My gosh that bit at the end was amazing
7:58 hmmmm
WHAT THE ACTUAL F-. Canada is freind not food.
Awesome Video.
Hundred Years War for the next full 2 vids
THE LEGEND IS BACK
Oversimplified, I have watched your videos since the start and I would like to say thank you. Not only have your videos helped me learn about history, they me have fun as well. Before this I would have said the best video you made was about Napoleon, however now knowing about this video,  I believe this is the best video you have made. Thank you
This timing Is literally perfect, we are learning about this topic in history class. I can't wait to tell my teacher about this.
Anyone know the music at 19:16?
Do Vietnam or the Texas revolution
That ending was legendary!
See you again in 4-5 months can't wait already
1:25 OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Oversimplified deserves to have 10M subs For Making Very entertaining Fun history videos.
God damn this turned into a full on shit post by the end 😂
When oversimplified posts you know it’s going to be a great day
Good ending
As a Washingtonian those islands are in my backyard. And it's thanks to American brinksmanship and an enterprising potato farmer that they're in my backyard and not Canada's backyard. They're very nice to visit. Thanks, Lyman Cutler!
Oversimplified2024
Holy shit they got Morgan Freeman
That pump action musket is cursed  Edit: I’m a blind dunce because that’s a double barrel shotgun, either way it’s still cursed as hell and lives only in Brandon Herrera’s nightmares
That ending was the greatest thing ever
WOOOO
10/10 one of if not your best video I've seen
BABE WAKE UP OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED
YESSSSS A NEW ONE THAT I CAN WATCH 843 TIMES 🤣🤣
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED EVERYONE CELBERATE
Yo boi sounded like UrinatingTree at the end talking about Canada
'They made me cry like a BIG GIRL , YAAY' LMAO 🤣🤣
DO STALIN OVERSIMPLIFIED!!! His life story is WACK
38 min new Video? YES PLEASE!
I’ll have you know, I put myself in South Korea because I’m too broke to visit myself
Welp. Time to learn a whole now history lesson
Beginning of the video: Benjamin Franklin’s curves End of the video: *MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS OUR DESTINY TO INVADE CANADA*
I've never heard oversimplifies patriotic voice, now I want more of it.i can listen to that every night
“Back to war they go” Me: very expected of humans
The Ending....Oh...Canada
You should do one on Mexico now :)
It’s hard to make videos like these it takes so much editing and the correct voiceover so. The videos come a little late but they are helpful
It’d be nice if he stopped crediting the communist leader and used someone like Uncle Sam to address America, Biden isn’t my president and a lot of other peoples as well and I think that when he credits pedo joe he’s being a little to political. You can get rid of that if you just us Uncle Sam as the rep for America.
DRAKE
WWII gets 27 minutes of OverSimplified. The Pig War gets 38. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH  OVERSIMPLIFIED BAACCCCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm pretty sure Canada secretly keeps its hockey teams well-trained to handily repel any U.S. invasion force.  If someone hasn't already made a movie about that, they should.
Your animations are hilarious and surprising, maybe honey and nord are useful..
That ending was amazing. I thought it was going to be an ad when he asked why the U.S. couldn’t invade Canada
Welcome back. We’ve missed you.
BABE WAKE UP!! OVERSIMPLIFIED JUST POSTED!!!
BRUH THE END LMFAO. As a Canadian that ending was hilarious. Great video man XD
When you animated the San Juan Islands being conceded by the British to the Americans you left a single island at the top green.
When we all needed him...... He returned
The BESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“The only casualty was just a pig”  -PETA would like to know your location
nice video :D greetings from Peru !
11/10 video, the likes to viewers ratio says it all. Though the roughly 1,100 angry canadians hitting the dislike are a real shame.
sex
Can you make a video about Bulgaria we got good history 🇧🇬❤️
Try me America you can't even touch the Great White North.   I hope you like hockey because you're going to get pucks in your face.   PS. Love your Channel
27:26 Nice detail the broader actually changed
Just a fun fact that the pig war was one of the forgotten wars that America have involved militarily including the United States intervention in Russia during the Russian civil war, the banana wars in central and South America, and the Korean expedition in 1871 which is considered the very first Korean War before the one in 1950
for the roast, best video ever
This is simply a masterpiece
Invade Canada? I'm down. I love maple syrup
Drake 2024
Another great story of America resolve 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 lol
Hey oversimplified how many months until you post another video?
Yay! Hi oversimplified!!!
HES BACK!!!!!
how this not number one trending
all i can say is  *nice*
As someone who lives in Washington state I want that ending to come true
Ever just look in the recommended videos and see this legend posting again?
As a Canadian I feel the ending intimidating
His Ad game is just getting better and better.
Beautiful
Very entertaining  I like appreciate the video Oversimplified The video was fantastic.
This was the best ending
Well, you my friend should use Nor- *skip 60 seconds*
Straight line chain
What the fuck is this video
As a Canadian I can say that the end was the best cinematic moment in youtube history.
Manifest destiny on Canada? Sounds like some fallout shit
I thought this was gonna be even stupider than the Emu War, and I was not disappointed.
Yay
Yes.
3:54 “I hear voices all the time.”
As a Washingtonian we own the islands boyyo
At last a new vid
That ending! Holy crap!!!🤣🤣🤣
As a Canadian living within a few hours drive/boat ride of where this incident took place, I can safely say that there are plenty of people around here that are STILL mad about this affair... personally tho, I find the whole thing hilarious. 🤣
6:30 “What did Henry mean by duckies?” One of so many funny Easter eggs.  This guy is a genius.
32:45 easily my favorite part in this entire video! (It made me laugh for 5 minutes straight) people like you really know how to make history fun, please keep up the good work!
The way Nord VPN ad pops up outta nowhere is amazing..  The ad no longer feels irritating.
If you ever run out of ideas for videos, you could do the long history of the Chinese dynasties. That would give you ideas for a little while
the ending is so great
Thatending Joke describes a Total dystopia for me.  Canada is not perfect but it's a hell of a lot better than the US in nearly every Aspect. (also Nuclear warheads would render the entirety of the areas nuked completley inhospitable and desolate for decades to centuries Lmao)
I actually gasped and froze up when I saw this.
Classic Canada v USA border gore, I mean border dispute
Breathtaking... Absolutely Breathtaking.
That ending was a patriotic Masterpiece
the general just hiding behind the door just knowing this dude's gonna f*ck up is hilarious
when the world needed him the most                       And you get a Porsche! and you get a Porsche! Everybody gets a Porsche! -King Louie the Third
Sengoku war please
Oversimplified might be a boss fight every time he sponsor
Americans couldn't conquer Afghanistan or Vietnam how do they expect to invade and conquer Canada?! They're better at making war movies than actually being successful at war.
This is so epic!
Why does NordVPN always inspire the best advertisements?
670k views in 4 hours lol
That ending was hilarious.
An ending that we don't needed but was given to us anyway.
Those beavers ;-;
👍
Oh silly America
Stop ryming
Did you know?
...may I refer you to Canada's historical record in global conflict?
4:11
FINALLY AN UPLOAD!!! Christmas came in early!
I would like to see Jim Crow laws and segregation
The Star wars theme is epic!!!
hop in boys, we gotta go manifest destiny canada.
Canada really does have no defense eh?
took to long dude uncool
I'm Asian so idc
Was that Morgan Freeman
Oversimplified is a treasure of youtube. He must me protected.....like that pig :)
Hint: Oversimp usually uploads every 6 months i think lol
And when the world needed him the most the Avatar returned
The Canada shout out though lmao
I was just rewatching all the oversimplified content, this is a gift from the gods
Great outro
Idea: Gombe Chimpanzee War
Nee Zealand, Canada, Australia, Wales, Northern Ireland, South Africa, South Korea, Japan, Scotland, the US, England, Ireland, Taiwan and India should just become one happy nation. We're all pretty much the same. France and German could join too.
33:20 is literally the funniest shit I've seen in ages.
Hay man your  video  are amazing , I only seeing the video for 2 months ,  but they areGood. keep up the good work
dnnddnd
Ok so I wake up and see an oversimplified video being posted.... Neat
Guys I don’t know why but I think Oversimplified is a bit annoyed about comments complaining about him not talking about Canada enough
OH YES, YOU UPLOADED!!!
It's amazing to go back and see how far this channel has truly come both in quality and amount of information
I would unironically support Biden invading Canada. Hell, I'd enlist to help conquer that joke of a country.
You forgot something America, we have the power of EUROPEAN COUNTRIES!!!🤯🤯🤯 Combined strength will OVERCOME your country!!!🤯🤯🤯
Its Christmas!
When Oversimplified uploaded a video after 6 months but it isnt a part 1 and 2 videos :((

I fear for our national security, Biden have mercy
This part made me laughed so much lmao 31:00
Sorry
Finally we have what we waited for since a 10000 years
I absolutely loved this 1000000/10 my new favorite video on this channel will watch till i die. Oversimplified you did an amazing job keep it up brother its absolutely amazing and the ending was absolutely perfect
I have been touched by oversimplified's speech at the end... After i hear he's speech i saluted him..
It has returned, after months of waiting. We thank you for making our life better man, it was a great video. LMFAO.
Ok yankees come on in let's see how the Californians like meter high snow drifts temps as low as -40°C and constant darkness for the winter.
Yay
i was depressed, but then oversimplified posted
Biden’s coming is the scariest thing I’ve heard in this channel
Dude just declared war on Canada
Buchanan being nervous about everything is one of the funniest bits OverSimplified ever put out.
Finally after an eternity u are back
Why do the pigs look like the pig walder from gravity falls
im all in for a invasion of canada, think of all that living space
Canada should invade alaska
good vid
Don't worry guys! I talked with God, and he approves of us God fearing Americans manifesting our destiny all over Canadian soil. God wills it!
15:28 I love that they’re on a Mini and a Mustang 😂
The 7th Earl of Jizzingham
Finally your back.
WHOOO AMERICA!! LETS GO BRANDON!!
I love this channel
You really should make a video about the Turkish war of independence
plz do Spanish-American war
I love Oversimplified
i love this video so funny
Very pog
he came back after 6 months absolutely worth the wait
YES
My brother came back letssss goooooo!!!
I've forgotten that Oversimplified haven't posted anything on his channel. So I was actually shocked when I saw this
I want more
Never has something made me feel so American as the last few seconds of this video
WE NEED. MORE VIDS PLZ
What. Was that ending 😂😂😂 probably one of my favorite videos, and it’s crazy I’d never heard of this!
Just woke my parents up with my lafter
3:33 what is florida doing 😳
this video was amazing.
That pig sounded like Leonard Nimoy
Canada is America’s hat, bitches.
Ending was cringe and shitty
As a Canadian... I might need a night light tonight
never stop doing these videos we love them
Canadians: my beautiful pig  Americans: I DONT WANT PEACE!! I WANT PROBLEMS ALWAYS!!!
Welp. It's time to destroy Canada. They've been too good for too long...
8:47 me whenever I win an argument in the shower against myself
Everyone: Come on, OverSimplified!  Cover the Vietnam War next. OverSimplified: Pig
Lets goooo New vid
Finally
OverSimplified should do a alternate history video about america invading canada
Dood, that ending made things from 0 to 100. It was almost like the birth of a new Hitler there. Better hope Vanoss doesn't watch these dood.
Bruh, did anyone else get fired up to go join the Army to take what should belong to the US?
the pig animation at the end was weird lol
Finally, The lion is awake.
Gotta say best video made so far story wise and animation wise
Let’s goo new vid
Suck it Canada I want that future Oversimplified should go off script more often
This is actually so entertaining. Please don't stop. It so amazing that you can make such a boring subject so interesting
This is possibly the best historical content in history
finely a video
Now where's the potato war oversimplified
CIRCLE MAN
The Pig War video is almost 3 times as long as your WW1 videos combined. You can totally add more details to your major war videos
Oversimplified please do your next video on Turkish İndipandance War
Hey OverSimplified where's the VIETNAM WAR video we've been waiting for???
The ending! 🤣🤣🤣
OverSimplified writes his videos like I write my AP US History essays.
His back
Straight line, straight line
This whole episode made me... furious.  Edit: I just finished it. I can see what the comments were talking about.
31:03 was that Morgan Freeman?
Yay
_"But the Americans keep coming and they don't stop coming. Hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running."_  - _OverSimplified_
This guy is amazing
Me being Canadian 0_0
I haven't seen the video yet, but there better be atleast one *PIG* involved.
Not 1 dislike
Ah yes i love to snuggle with a drawing 🙏😏
I detect ksp music at 12:30
Your humor is genuinly better than the History Channel, thank you!
This episode was awesome! I do notice your animation has gotten a lot better. Well done
The pig turn to Morgan Freeman bruh 🤣
How to handle the complicated border:  "Straight line?" "Straight line"
Natives exist And this angered the Americans who punished them severely
_And when the world needed him most, he returned_
Finally months of waiting
FINNALLYYY
Make a vid about the Vietnam war
Thank you nordvpn, we get a new video 🥳
HE UPLOADED!!!! YAY!!!
Very funny moments, but this regrettably is the first video I have to dislike
The orgen trail refence with dysentery just craked me up 😂
So basically we could’ve gone to war over a pig. Wow. Thanks for the British captains for not landing their troops.
Finally uploaded thank u oversimplified😃
that ending was one of the best things i've seen for a while
This just in: America and Canada enter war over idiot history YouTuber. Ironic, how he was talking about a war that was almost started over a stupid reason. More at 11.
Only 4 minutes in and I'm crying tears of laughter.
Main thing I got from this video…. SUCK IT CANADA!!! Red White and Blue WILL SOON BE COMING FOR YOU!!!!!
what an ending
OVERSIMPLIFIED SNOWMAN POGGG
Moral of the story, a lot of Americans are idiots and the few with common sense and the rest of the world are surrounded by said idiots and are forced to put up with them.
THE KING IS BACK
The king is back
This is the only time you'll hear anything interesting about Washington state
That ending was unexpected and one of the funniest things i've seen in awhile haha.
What are you looking at steven?!  Steven: Th-The ground, just looking at the ground...
:D
usa good    to      canada
Do the French Indian war next please
When we needed him the most he returned.....
Where have you been man so long time to rrsurface
Damn it, one minute in and you already got a roar of laughter from me. Even if it was from some dark humor. I'm enjoying this.   Edit: that ending was something else I did not expect at all. AND I LOVE IT!
Oversimplified's Logo should have Nordvpn as his hair
Straight line?
7:15 why in england is a dick
As a Canadian, I just like being talked about eh? :)
Finalyyyy
You hear that Canada, *we’re coming, and there’s nothing your liquid sugar gold can do about it*
Welcome back oversimplified we have missed you
What the hell was the end of this video LMFAO
Man I loved that end part
Your voice acting has gotten so good
I believe this channel is a NORD VPN side venture
The ending was personal
Canadians are so nice. They were kind all the way back in the 1850s and let America draw the straight line.
You should do Texas revolution
Their is honey and then there is NordVPN. And then there is Raid Shadow Legends this video's sponsor.
finally new oversimplified vid
What did the Canadians do to him? He's a madman
i hope the vid is about technoblade
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaa
Did I just watch a YouTuber declare war on Canada on behalf of America?
Lmfaooo love this channel!!!
uhm uhm... Canada burned the White house :D
I expected Oversimplified to release new videos every three months, but no! This angered his impatient fan who punished him severely for missing the deadline!
It has been forever.....
Dearest Canadians,  If you fine folks could just voluntarily join the Union, there’ll be no need for an invasion, AND you resolve the Quebec question once and for all, for the United States has a better track record of preventing secession.  I’d call it a win-win situation. Think about it.
YES FINALLY AFTER 5 TIRED MONTHS
Me a Canadian who saw that last part: Aight burn the white house.
The perfect ending doesn’t exi-
Perfect portrayal of Buchanan
But I'm Canadian
The false Americans should fear us true Americans, we will unite under capitalism.
You better watch out Canada, you’ve had this coming for years
Ah yes. Colonialism, subjugation of other races, and disputes over random ass islands. Like father like son.
"Straight line?" "Straight line." *What an intellectual conversation.*
I'm sure this won't cause anyone *to DIE*
Murica
Best oversimplified video omg this is awesome
What was that outro
--------------------------------- straight line?
Oversimplified back with a banger!!
Hey can you do the Texas Revolution?
I AM SO HYPED TO INVADE CANADA AND GET SOME AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE! RED WHITE AND BLUE MOUNTIES HERE I COME!
Love the videos keep it up.
I've been waiting, and I've been greeted, by a Pig War.  The six months was all worth it for that Ending
The like to view to comment ratio is insane 500k views 100k likes 11k comments lol
Hey plz do the Mexico and America war thank you love the video
Your best video yet, but is no one talking about the perfect Star Wars artwork on the thumbnail?
Huh, well that explains all the British Americans in Oregon.
Next Oversimplified Episode: "World War Eight, America vs the World"
As a Canadian I'm scared
4:30 the evidence that canada is in fact the true north americans
Dk why but the idea of a British official in the Whitehouse just shouting BUCHANAN. Like a headmaster just makes me laugh and smile. Also as someone who has worked on pig farms in Yorkshire  I can understand a war starting starting over a pig being shot
So glad this was a perfectly normal video, that didn’t end in insanity
This video was so funny i thought it was 10 minutes and just looked it up its 40 wtf lol
THE LEGEND IS BACK!!!
I was seriously waiting for Vietnam war
This should have been an episode of miniwars
Glad a new one is out!
Pig pin looks like Mabel’s pig from gravity falls
was literally looking up the pig war a day ago
YES!!!  JOIN THE MOVEMENT!!  LONG LIVE REPUBLICANISM!
New video and I ordered my self 2 plushies (one for me and one for the person who told me the video is up). So in about 4 months after they come out I can hug my OverSimplified plush and dream of emos and emus 😁.  FYI I gave the wide birth of a time frame due to shipping from USA to Aus
Loved the video but as a brit I had to dislike because of the end, so sorry
Babe wake up oversimplified just uploaded
Why stop at Canada? Why not continue to Mexico? Manifest Destiny is on our side! We must control all of North America and form the Canadian United States Mexico zone!!!
The ending was totally on the next level
as a diabetic, i appreciate the "affordable insulin" joke.
Steam McSteamface!  There definitely needs to be a steamboat named that.
*Sweats in Canadian*
3:38 DENSITY!!!
I love how with each oversimplified video his yelling gets progressively crazier
Can't tell if the density in 3:38 is a joke or not
FINALLY… AN UPLOAD
7:58 bars 🥶
Can’t wait for the Mexican American war video…please or the Spanish American war
The greatest ending of the 21st centry
7:58 to 8:02 I have heard this before, but I don't know where. Can someone help me please?
This was Amazing 😃
"Bidens coming with a vengeance!" Bruh he only going for the kids and then pulling troops out before anything can be done 😂
You made me stay up until 11 P.M.
I thought to myself earlier, I wonder when the next oversimplified video will be out. Didn't take long to find out.
I both love and hate this
7:57 he did not LMAO
I actually almost cried during the pig flashback scene
Omg so good!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
You should do an episode on Texas history
Striaght line? Straight Line
YOOOOOOOOOO I LIVE THERE LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
If america conquers canada Would something change? Probably, something yeah But the Maple Syrup would still be called Canadian ownership, why? Because the Healthcare is a bonus
"Woah woah woah! I didn't say they were white"  *cheering intensifies*   This made my day thank you oversimplified ;)
It is 5 am in romania,but you posted
Yay! New episode!!
who else thought this was about technoblade
“Kick Mclellan in the shins”
You should do a video on Stanislav Petrov, the "Man Who Saved the World" from nuclear war!
This is a video that doesn't need a dislike button
comment bump
"Why not annex Canada, ww3 that's why." Fallout
HESS BACCKKKL
7:57, I understood that reference
Gee man why didn't you give the Vietnam War
Taking the flag pole was the cherry on top.
Babe…babe! Wake up! New oversimplified just dropped!
"Straight line?"   "Straight Line!"...
I love the napoleon reference with the mentioning the Louisiana purchase, I still think we can all agree that those two videos are oversimplified at its peek
That guy wanted the equivalent of *3546 2021 DOLLARS FOR A PIG*
Oversimplifieds videos should be the only reason why a dislike button doesn’t exist
finally his back
Me : is there a way I could appreciate him Oversimplified : Hi ! There is ( like and subscribe )  Me : Fantastic . So I clicked it  ( A dialogue by oversimplified in Ww1 😃😃 )  Love from India
Guess I’m not sleeping for another 38 minutes
Nice video
im down to invade canada
Well now, I want to take Canada!
YESSS FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
Toledo War when?
"Lorraine, my density..."
Bruh...holy shit 😂 this entire thing is perfect.
If war happened, it's possible the southern states suceeded earlier and British back them up along with France and Spain against us, Russia, Prussia.  So ww1 would start way earlier over some tiny islands in the pacific
The quality in every new video just gets better and better. I can't wait for Oversimplified: Vietnam.
great ending
"MOLE! MOLE! MOLE! MOLE!"
make a video about BANGLADESH's liberation war
this isnt a video this is art  truly  spectacular from the perfectly edited animations to the not so subtle but tastefully done humor and last but certainly not least the message to Canadians to watch their backs as our glorious leaders Drake/Joe Biden come for that sweet sweet land in conclusion this was a masterpiece... thank you for coming to my ted talk
"YOU SWINE" "No no I killed the swine, I'm Lyman"
F for pig
I will say I’m quite scared of the end
Do the Vietnam War next plzzzzzz
It’s very entertaining to watch Oversimplified when you don’t actually know the video’s topic’s outcome.
FINALLY A KNOWLEDGE I NEED TO LIVE FROM OVERSIMPLIFIED
I’ve been waiting my entire life for this, every time oversimplified uploads it brings me joy and the feeling of a fresh breeze
super
16:00 how dare they make an American use that disgusting piece of communist machinery
What luck man! An OVERSIMPLIFIED upload! My day is sorted
So hey, Canada...what if we traded British Columbia for Maine? We'll leave Vancouver to you (kinda like Hong Kong) for 99 years. See, this way, the US will be contiguous with Alaska and you'll get both sides of the entrance to the St. Lawrence Seaway. Think of the fun you could have with that! Okay, I get it, BC's 10X's larger than Maine so we'll throw in Puerto Rico too. (think: year round beaches...yaaay!).  Deal?
Great video but what about that Vietnam war episode you promised ages ago????
The end almost killed me. I have been to Those islands and live in Nanaimo so that was really Interesting
Finally tks
Darth Piggy
NICE, HE'S GOING BACK!
I have to check but I don’t think oversimplified made a vid on the American/Mexican war yet,
the ending was a little bit fucky
I was not expecting a video on The Pig War from you. Good stuff!
It’s finally here
Fifty-four forty or fight!
Yay new video
This one seems a little rushed to me ngl. Just my opinion
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Leeesssttt goop
*unpopular opinion warning* There’s uh, a lot of woke white people/America is evil stuff off the bat in this one. I know, I’m bad for thinking that.
22:17 Wait how did that letter go through Panama if the canal wasn't completed yet?
that ending be interupted when russia seeks a chance to invade the U.S. and the little hamburger eaters climb in their bunkers
Watch out Canada, cause soon... I'm looking to move there and can I pwease have affordable healthcare for my autoimmune disorder 🥺 In all seriousness that ending was hilarious. And the way you potray americans throughout *chefs kiss* especially how calm and dignified the natives seem in comparison. Glorious.
Honey
37:14 *unsubscribe*
I absolutely loved the ending
5:53 these are getting better and better
My streak has officially come to an end   :( I called the Civil war videos. French Revolution and Napoleon videos. My next call was the Texas Revolution.
I feel the Enclave is coming
Buchannan...............looks like he had more than one blunder.
Bro no mention of Canada smh
That ending 😂
Hey look! A war about your mom
Can't imagine what they thought when the flag pole was missing "Almost there, we can finally raise the flag. Wait!" "What?" "Those dang Brits took the pole!"
Love You Oversimplified!! You are just so awesome!!
Silly Oversimplified, it's still almost a month to go before it's christmas. I still accept your present
15:30 hey it's the Top Gear mini
37:15 Fallout timeline be like:
What a piece of entertainment this video is
o this guy uploaded  i thought he would never upload please do a video about indian history
I WOULD LOVE TO BE AMERICAN!!! FELLOW ALBERTAIN HERE!!
What the hell was that ending ?!?  Hahaha
Rejoiceee he is backkk.... Rejoice
Fun little comment on the ending there from a Canadian....  You yanks actually have a sizable maple syrup industry, and ironically from what I have heard quite a bit of American maple syrup is of superior quality (as much as that pains me to say). The Canadian maple syrup industry, though larger is run by a cartel filled with control freaks. The American maple syrup industry does not have that problem, and with fewer ideal sugar bushes has had to get creative and has made several notable innovations in the industry.
I thought the Vietnam war should be next one
straight line?
HE IS BACK LETS GOOOOOOOOO (Just as funny as I remember lol)
Finally, an oversimplified video.
33:29 best moment of any oversimplified video to exist ever. made me laugh more than anything else ive ever laughed at
God bless America
I'm from Whatcom County, some people around here still talk about this history. It's kind of cool to see us in an oversimplified video.
This could be entirely made up and I would have no idea
Great 👍
That pig eerily resembles a certain pig from a 2012 Disney show...
you know, I appreciate that this channel is quality over quantity, but two videos per year is definitely not enough. Love ya mr oversimplified.
i has to check twice until i realised that i was an actually oversimplified vid
The gun the rat was holding was a fallout 4 combat rifle.
Sadness, great video but I had a test on this 4 hours before this came out😢
Never fails to entertain and educate me.
Meme: 5:51
When I saw this video I got so happy. Great video.
very nc jokes you have there
3:51 "And who was it who spoke to God?"  (Quietly, from the crowd) "I hear voices all the time!"  Haha nice!
ಹೇ ಅದು ಜಾಹೀರಾತು
Bts bioy
over simplified Anglo Zanzibar war
In 2046, America will keep manifesting destiny until it's drawn a straight line through the entire world
I got a plush
Do the boxer rebellion
To claim freedom under colonizers, only to become colonizers themselves. I love irony.
USA BABY WERE NUMBER 1
I feel he had the most fun with this one.
Yes yes YES YES A NEW VIDEO
I love the consistency. You can immediately tell it’s Winfield Scott before he even says his name
Who else shouted “yesss” after six months
Finally oversimplified uploaded
Oversimplified too clean with these sponsors bro I never see them coming
Moral lf the story it ain't white then it free to be capitalised
In 1469 in Poland was a war between two towns over one cow. 300 man died in fight, 100 were taken as hostage and starve to death after rejection of ransom offer.
Best video by far
Biden’s coming with a vengeance😂😂😂 I would love to see that pathetic excuse for a president try and invade us! Let’s go Brandon!🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Dude.. so cool!
pog
Why Canada at the end
Finally a new oversimplified.
Thompson guns in the 1800's and someone cocking a musket like a shotgun.........feels like something is historically inaccurate here.  and biden stopped coming along time ago.
"Why'd you sign it, you marshmallow"  I just found a new insult.
Can you post a video every 7 days
The end gag would've been better with Trump. We all know Biden wouldn't protect his allies, never mind invading a country.
Great Video!
LETS UFCKIG kjndasf'; d
I feel like Pickett is gonna ask me for some .32 French longue
Over whether the US CANADA border looked like this or like this. *no change at all*
The king is back!
Perfect way to end the night
Oversimplified deserves so many more subs it’s almost unbelievable
what the f- -OverSimplified 2021
A looting the ice box are we
Don't you hate it when a random British guy just turns into a great vpn.
It seems that the Pig War will be more remembered by these people here than the disputes of the Alaska Panhandle or the Northwest Passage
“I hear voices all the time” lmfao
Yes!! A new video!
It's been a long time since you made a video
Pls do some Indian history PLS!!!
That ending, I would join the military for that. Also, strait line? Strait line. Gold.
I was literally checking your channel this weekend and I was like dang he should be uploading about now to just come on and see this.
I can hear all the brits keyboard mashing after Oversimplified called 1812 a draw
You are great!
HE UPLOADED
+im depressed and i really need something to make me feel better  _you want some coffee? +no Well do you need some professional help? +no _oversimplified posted a video +thats it baby
Yay another upload!
Praise the lord We’ve been BLESSED
Dear God, oversimplified posted! Can you make a video on thirty years war?
I knew I heard of the world Pickett. Captain Pickett is the same guy who helped lead picketts charge.
YES HE POSTED THIS MADE MY DAY
Love from India
FUCK YEAH FINALLY WE INVADING CANADA BOIS! GRAB YOUR GARANDS WERE DOING THIS LIKE OLD TIMES!
OH MY GOD HAS IT BEEN LIKE 6MONTHS 6 YEARS SINCE THE LAST VIDEO IT'S BEEN AGES!!!! I can't tell whether I'm happy or angry 😐😑

Omg *spoiler* is this declaration of war 😳? 36:36
Damn. I’m Canadian and that last part really got me. Nice vid oversimplified.
Do one on Fall of Afghanistan 2021 plz 😀
"if you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine"  -obi wan Kenobi
History time
Ok history channel time to pick it up as a show
😂😂 bruh that ending!
With that freak out calm the f down bro no need to start a war against your ally.
Gotta say that voice acting is absolutely amazing.
Been waiting for this for the last 4 weeks when i worked out how long it took oversimplified to make each video
As if Canada politely losing a war just to get rid of Detroit isn't a justifiable enough reason to go to war with Canada, what is?
Oversimplified, you make History so entertaining and informative. You are worth the wait.😍
The end of this video is so American I stood up saluted while biting on my double bacon cheeseburger heart attack meal
Spuddy the hedgehog
so what about Mexico
As a Canadian I can confirm that the only thing we do is think of America
Oh fuck yeah our boi dropped
Felt bad for the pig.
Lymen killed a pig      This angered Griffin, who punished him severely.
Sooooo are we just talking about invading Canada or are we doing it?
Another successful video from Oversimplified. No biggy but at 5:35 they had the Union Jack upside down! Just saying! 🤔
P i g
sponsers in videos are horrible, oversimplified makes them bearable. because he makes nord VPN funny
i did not expect this.
7:56 I Like how there's a All Star Referance
Another amazing video oversimplified!!!
I normally don't like advertising mixed into content, but the way that was worked in actively made me laugh. 😂
the pig was the saddest death in history  change my mind
IT's my DENSITY! XD
Lets get it!
Are we just leaving the Vietnam war as a meme or can you do that soon
That ending was great lol
As a shirtless Hawaiian watching this I must say I could feel that pin stabbing the shirtless Hawaiian in the video and screamed in pain alongside him
The cover of the video looks like it came ouof steven universe
Oversimplified should run for president. That speech he gave at the end was legendary
I really want him to upload a video about indian revolution
Nord VPN is a Icon on this Channel
George got cake tho
37:10
Ah yes the obligatory we only conqured the West because they werent white joke. Hack much?  Do tell me one civilization that did not partake in the conquering other people for land and resources. That lived to tell about it. I'll wait.
This is 100% his best video of all time
New video made my day
This is hilarious and educational and perfect and I love it so much!
Mexican American war when?
I was hoping for the Vietnam war,but god damm did Oversimplified did not fail to entertain us with a war we didn't even know about
babe wake up, oversimplified uploaded
Dude where have you been? Where r u?
That ending 🤣
Amazing star wars refrence
That was so good
History had Pig war and last year we had   Potato war. im starting to see a pattern here...
New video? Today's a good day
When the world needs him the most, he returned to cherish all pathetic soul😍🔥
As a Canadian that last part was amazingly done
Video had too much filler... Please get to the point.
i was waiting for this
Biden would be stupid enough to invade an ally
Don't worry Canada, Biden won't remember.
"Wake up honey, OverSimplified just posted"
Canada’s free healthcare is a bad thing as it makes them wait so long they often come here to pay instead of wait
37:24   THE TRUE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!!
Yes this is what i was waiting for 👍🏻
30:31 this was the best part of the video
11:53 That’s one of the things I love about this channel. Sometimes, they DID indeed say that! 😂
YEEEEEEEEEEE LESSS GOOOOOO NEW UPLOAD
What a weird period of time. A dead pig can nearly cause a major conflict. imagine the outrage if that happend nowadays. Funny
Yesterday I was thinking that it was about time for another one of these videos and my wish came true.
As a Canadian all I can say is bring it on we haven’t lost a war and we aren’t starting now
Got a little unhinged there for a moment...
As an American, that ending made me laugh so hard! I gotta send it to some of my friends in Canada!
I’m going to be honest I really needed one of these videos just to have fun learning man thank you man so much for your amazing art and historical knowledge
Lyman... shot..the....pig
Jar sized oversimplified plushie
YES I just saw to notification and I have to watch this NOW
The criss cross umbrellas over the British guy’s front door was a very nice touch. 😂. 5:46
Guess who's back. Back again.
I'm not even canadian but I gotta say... as if Biden could do shit.
everyone be like when he uploads be like gogogogogogoogogogogogogogogoogogo
Oversimplified for president let’s get more territory baby all of Canada will be ours 😈😈😈
The king is back!!!
Love you OS
For five hungred year this is the first time that oversimplified make a new video
4:08 As an American, I can say that was both beautifully chaotic, and 100% correct
Love the smash mouth reference👍🏿
Finally
Amazing
Somehow, the absolutely dumbest conflict was made into a masterpiece by oversimplified
holy frick an upload
You hear that, Alaska? It’s time to be a continental state at last!
Ok oversimplified bit harsh ending
I love how he drew Waddles as the pig
That ending.  Could it be the opening salvo of [dun dun DUNNNN] the OverSimplified War?
Lol probably the best ending ever 😂😂🤣🤣😂
YES!! I've been waiting for someone to highlight the Pig War! It's my favorite bit of history here in Washington!
This is the greatest YouTube channel
Pig of war?
Soooo oversimplified himself declared on Canada. Pop-corn anyone?
Straight line? straight line.
Let's invade Canada
Love that back to the future reference 3:38
he upload :)
Yay new video
Amazing video as always, it would be really cool to see you tackle the entire Lee Harvey Oswald conspiracy. Talking about each theory in detail.
this video was so good
who wants to burn down the whitehouse with me
Pig                       Pig
I like to imagine that Oversimplified was just drunk and just spurted out whatever he came up with on the spot while writing that ending.
humanity vs animals saga :-  season 1 - pig war season 2 - emu war season 3 - goat war  credits :-  actors - pigs, goats, emus and humans  director - nature  based upon a true story
This is so cool! I live in the area where this went down, and it was so interesting to see all these locations that I know. I also never remember learning about this in my local history class so it was absolutely amazing to here
loved the last part
What happened bro?
My guy made a 38 minute animation just to piss off his Canadian subscribers. That's the most American thing ever
Lets gooo
"Yes! I'm covered in poo and I'm the luckiest man alive!" Me, when I become a dad.
his not dead HES NOT DEAD
British Force: We’ll arrest you if you don’t apply! American Force: We’ll shoot you if you don’t apply!
HE UPLOADED!!
This gift to the viewers during the holidays pleased all of them, which made them punish the subsribe button severely
"54-40 or fight!"  Is that a Jack Rackham reference? I love that channel! Good ol' Polkie Poo!
Us Canadians still need more
USA: I'M COMIN FOR YOU  Canada, remembering 1812:  Come get me b****
BABE WAKE TF UP, OVERSIMPLIFIED JUST UPLOADED
Begun, the pig wars, have….
This is such a revolutionary video
F for all the bison lost in the making of this video... and throughout history
Why do you want to invade Canada when you can't invade Vietnam?
Takes long time to make video but make great video
YAAA NEW VID
Can you do history in viet nam war
I LOVE YOU OVERSIMPLIFIED
Only Oversimplified will make a 40 minute entertaining ass video on the most randomness event in history.
I was just thinking that oversimplified was due for a video and holy shit you do not disappoint!!! You're awesome!
Oh thats what this is:)
HE IS BACK!
Finally
Roll.  That.  Beautiful.  Bean.  Footage.
This was by far the most over the top episode of Oversimplified. And I absolutely loved every minute of it!
Easily the best Oversimplified video
Canada must of pooed his pants at that
HE DID IT. HE ACTUALLY DID IT. HE UPLOADED!
yey
My favorite yet
YYYYYYYEEEEEAAAAAHHHHH!!! OVERSIMPILIFED UPLOAD UUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH YAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
HES BACK
The ending made me laugh so hard it made me wanna go invade canada!!!!!
Sorry about all those commenters complaining about yer lack of Canadian content there bud. you’re doing a fine job indeed and I’m quite happy with what you’ve done regarding Canada in history. We don’t mean any harm, it’s just we like it when we’re mentioned and recognized in historical events, like Juno beach on d-day or vimy ridge in ww1. Because a lot of Canadian history goes widely unspoken outside of Canada, mostly because of our very notable (and powerful) neighbours overshadowing us with their long and very well known history. and when we’re mentioned on something other than the CBC, it sends a special message to us that people do remember or appreciate what we did in history, and that we did make a difference in the world.  Again, sorry for the comments. -a Canadian viewer 🇨🇦
this is my new fav
I'd just like to say that this is your best, funniest video yet and I really hope there are many more to come.
*Finally a new video from the legend himself*
This video feels similar yet different to some of the others and it was really refreshing and funny to watch. I'm not even gonna make a funny joke or tired reference, just straight-up kudos to you man, looking forwards to the next one.
The legend is back!!
Finally a new one!
5:55 the best promotion ever in my life idk why I don't even have the chapter in my book but I love to watch your videos 👍😭
Bro, I was literally just wondering about you two days ago!!!
Great ending
HE'S BACK
Pig start war with potato for pig

33:03 Why does ''Caption Hunt'' Look like he is Hitler.....
Nevertheless your vids is entertaining as heck
Hah, Canadians am i right?!?! lmao *farts*

My happiness is immeasurable and my day is made!
The American general, William S. Barney. Great to see that Barney was in the American army, I guess

You really know how to rally the troops
You always dominate the youtube views leaderboard 🤣
This video was so good i liked it twice lololol

Nice Star Wars title card and thumbnail you got there.
OverSimplified make i history

I like the end
Also don’t get mad I think that oversimplified is one of the greats of youtube
HIS BACK
Lmao that ending derailed so quickly XD
Keep up the videos your a legend
1,369 sheep you say? :)
37:10 Truly incredible.
hes back
I like how a small incident presented so humorous can teach us significant lessons about how crisis can be averted when calm and professional men are taking decisions.
Wow...... what a nice surprise for me to wake up and find out this new video😁.
Hey now pls talk about india
Man ! Where you guys been . Love your videos !!
Ay Im from whatcom county 😤
Beautiful.
Whenever we think about taking over Canada just remember that 1. They are responsible for Justin Bieber although they apologized 2. They have lots of maple syrup 3. Its colder up north 4. Its beaches are rocky not sandy
Greatest video on YouTube
I’m Canadian should I be afraid of the last part of the video? Probably…
"Fat Porky" needs to be a recurring character. That was hilarious.  P.S. Watch out Canada!!!!
bro new video lets gggoooo
OverSimplified releasing his hatred for Canadians following YouTube’s removal of the dislike button, Circa 2021 colorized
the ending is him snapping at the fact that we canadians are always commenting about how he keeps forgetting about canada and his plan to do something about it
Never go after an American with a mob without firearms, that’s a rookie mistake.
14:37 Trying to hit the word count on a school paper be like
Keep making videos oversimplified it really helps
38:16 Me:*shoots oversimplified*
oh my god that ending
It's pronounced Brandon.
Ayooo new video lets goo
Holy shit finally
We want Vietnam War!!!!!
General Harney looks like Internet Historian
Other YouTubers: I'm making shorter videos so the algorithm will promote the more. OverSimplified: Oh..... I see So that's how it is, uh? That's how it's going to be, is it? That's the way in which things are, eh? That be how it will, is it? Wil it be how that is, huh? That be the way in which things be the way they are, is it?
2 two think my firend kuya go to canda and war us for reinforce mant uk and china and canda
Oversimplified video comes out: epic for 2 months dies to great then to good then a new video is posted and the cycle repeats
I’m Canadian and … If you declare wars to us … that will be a coalition agaisnt the US : Canada , France , UK , Russia , North Corea , Spain ( probably ) , China , Afghanistan , A lot of africain country and other  VS United-States-Of-America , Germany , soud corea and … well … someone else I think
I thought oversimplified left YouTube n But I am wrong which is good
the end: exists me, a canadian who didnt even know the comments existed: ok
Ad plays before video loads, likes video anyways
Your the best history YouTuber every and thank you for doing one on Canada 🇨🇦
in such a tough place and was wondering when another one of ur vids would upload then boom u upload..
That was the most american ending I've ever seen, now I want to drink and shoot guns
YESSSS
yay! >.< what can be a better morning to see oversimplified new video at your doors.
BIDEN IS COMING WITH A VENGEANCE!
ITS TIME TO INVADE THE SNOW HIPPIES!!!!!!!
I am sorry I am not mad but just courteous if they did go to war who would win
next vietnam war
I love all your videos please take your time and keep being passionate on what you’re doing. Cause being passionate to what you are doing will result in grade A stuff👍
Hell yeah! I live there! Imagine if I was Canadian!
Not gonna lie, when I saw the title, all I could think about was Technoblade
You should do Korean War part one then Vietnam war part 2
I use to all ways watch your videos every day all day  watching and rewatching I at least watch American revolutionaries wars about 100 times or more
Capt. Hornby? Does he make trains?
Finally, I don't feel alone for knowing about this obscure war lmao
10 years later we have the YT war started by oversimplied and made by oversimplied
37:11 Holy crap, that went from 0 to 10000000 real fast.
Straight line?
Please do 9/11 oversimplified
Wake up Babe, New Oversimplified video Just Dropped
Im in canada and I totally agree, they easily could take over canada. And the one photo of the mountains, I have been there its in Lake Louise
*The USA* Lebensraum: *nahhhh* Manifest Destiny: *yeahhhh*
I likely feel dictator vibes
I think he’s finally lost it.
Well Done Thank You !
Best video ever
The ending 👏 🇨🇦❌ 🇺🇸✔️
As someone who used to live in Vancouver and has visited Victoria island a few times, I now have a story to tell all my friends on our next ferry ride
Literally, right when I was like "man, I miss Oversimplified's content" this video drops into my recommended. :D  Edit: Okay, that ending...was legendary.
As a Canadian… I approve the ending. Nice.
I WANNA CUDDLE
Not sub in spanish 😭😭😭
Let goo
Yaaaaaaaay!
I missed your content!!!!!!!?
Yessssssssssss
Always nice to see a oversimplified upload
7:57 best part. Period
4:16 god this is hilarious
4:04 - 4:16 OMG THIS IS SO RELEVANT! Oversimplified, you did it again, you exceeded expectations and got a very good laugh out of all of us, even though you were explaining historical event which in my opinion was very funny to see because of your humorous depiction of it. I for one approve of it and I think you are doing a very good job, keep up the good work. As a suggestion, I think you should do the Russian Civil War next if possible. If not then how about the colonization of Africa? You do you buddy, you're amazing.
31:30
YEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
babe wake up oversimplified posted
Have you done Vietnam war?
After 5 months , the history king is back
Some people are gonna do something forbidden with that pushie
dude, if you want canada, all you have to do is ask nicely and they will give it to you.
Its back!
Can u do Texas Revolution next pls
The end of this video felt personal...
Ah yes the legend returns
FINALLY A VIDEO
It’s official, we lost this man. To quote the great Barney Stinson,” Canada, why do we let you be a country?”
This video is epic, from the thumbnail to the rant at the end.
he is back!! baby 4 hours 11K comments
Yes its here
7:39 He got the drop on his ops.
Next: The mexican-american war
Canadian here. Why do I feel like I just got the bad ending to an oversimplified video. Also the image of Drake as POTUS is not one I’ll get out of my head anytime soon, so thanks for that.
You're the best
That ending was great
Lmao Bidens comin'
Shoutout VANCOUVER WASHINGTON WOOOOOO
3:33 bro what the heck just popped out in between americas legs 😳
36:59
Do the Irish Civil War/ Irish War for Independence next
I’ve been waiting for this for a min
31:03 WHY DOES THE PIG SOUND LIKE MORGAN FREEMAN
OverSimplified World War 3 video when?
Everyone: talking about the ending  Me: was that Morgan freeman as a magical  talking Pig????
7:26
No to US and Canada merger because I don't want to be socialist
even today I saw people wanting to Unite Canada and US, ranging for joke to actually serious one.
I have a plan oversimplified just let me know when where rushing Canada
HES BACK
Its really impressive how he even makes tiny wars entertaining as hell
It becomes a great month when oversimplified uploads
I've never seen the British parliament so accurately portrayed
I LIVE IN CANADA WHY
Half a million views in 4 hours?
Return of the King
Lets invade Canada
XD the ending is pretty funny
The pig what?  Fat tony: The pig war
Genuinely would support/not mind Saskatchewan, British Colombia, or Alberta just leaving Canada for the US. I'm sure we'd accept. I would at least.   I recall months ago reading up on incidents in the 90s and 80s that called for succession, and I know of the all too familiar calls for Quebec to become it's own country.   No matter what wishing the Canadians and my fellow Americans to be able to get along for the foreseeable future.   Cheers to it!
Amazing, great work as always!
32:28 saving this for later. My favorite part. Everyone's an idiot except the Royal Navy (rule Britannia)
video ideas i would like to see : Stalin oversimplified  Mexican-American war on oversimplified  like if u would enjoy this and so he can hear the ideas 😁
Epic ending
Literally just as I was about to sleep last night, I was wondering what you were up to. Then I wake up this morning and see this lol.
Talks about not sleeping and posts it at 10 pm
It's almost time for an Oversimplified video, what I said since last week. And yeah, Mole! Mole! Mole! Mole! Mole!!!
WADDLES WAR!!!!
Big fan
damn, your animation is getting really good
That last part at the end had me cheering
8:48 so smooth
by far my favorite youtube channel
My god this shit was funny
the canadians will just hide upstairs then biden can't get us
If u recognize the pig from the thumbnail u r a true angry birds player
Canadians* 2:35
After you run out of history to make videos on you should do movies and shows like Star Wars and stuff
I think that ending made the entire nation of canada tremble in fear
27:19 this was it, WAR! "Over a small island in the middle of nowhere. Over a pig and some potatoes. Over whether if the US-Canada border looked like this, or like this! It was stupid." This part cracked me up.
4.02 the pope:am i a joke to you
I remember watching u in 5th grade WHNE u we’re at 400k. You’ve grown so much!
Me: see an new oversimplified video. Me: YES YES YES YES
I don’t know about the rest of you, but as a Canadian, I found that ending hilarious.
Yooo, look whose back!!
I sense a plot to destroy the Canadians lmao
The issue about map boundaries back in the day is pretty redundant, and it does contributed to a bunch of who owns what scenarios during this era.
Yo does anyone else want to see and aphganistan oversimplified
Drake was a wise choice, the... "Maple kin" will bend to their own more easily... **evil cackle**  Now, what shall Bieber's role be?
Sooo, you're telling us that America expanded because of racism but then went and attacked the white people in the north first?
Oversimplified is quality over quantity...
As someone from Bellingham Wa I must say I was so glad to see us get some representation, we made it to the big leagues boys
Cry harder that we had better weapons then the Indians and conquered them. You act like this has never happened in the past, it’s literally happening to this day, see Hong Kong and Ukraine.
Oversimplified can you please make a texas revolution and mexican american war!!
YOOOOO SHOUTOUT TO MY LOCAL AREA! can't believe it's on oversimplified
oversimplified does it again. Love the ending, keep up the good work!
ah finally, is here!
The live reply section is full of British haters, just look at it
MANIFEST DESTINY
Dude I love these
Good luck getting Americans to agree to have a war with Canada
Do Indian Revolution
God that ending was legendary
Background The Pig Military escalation
You're back! I missed you!
I just had a test on this, you weren't a few days too late for me! 😭😭😭
Oversimplified!!!!!!!!!!!!
best video
I went into this not expecting much. I was wrong
Meh, why would we want to invade Canada? We've already got Tim Hortons, William Shatner, and the Stanley Cup. What else could Canada possibly have to offer?
You make my life better and for a fifth grader I know more than my history teacher is teaching us this year
OH HELL YEAH FINALLY
having a oversimplified video on a monday is just the best way to start the week with a smile, ly man keep it up.
Omg finally  After soo long  Thanks guys 😇
The ending is great
My Grandma lives on the islands and she took us to the cemetery where the pig is barried, yes indead the pig was barried in a cemetery, and given a proper barrial.
AFTER SO LONGGGGGGGG FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
That ending fucking sent me
1:26 just got me 37:25 then remembers that canada never lost a war
37:18 You guys may have the manpower and the arms but I have an amazing idea...when they approach we run away
OR! Guys, I know it is not normal to have two comments in one video, but I think we really broke oversimplified here… may you recover soon mate…🤪
See you all in another 6 months!
as an American who lives on the islands I was shocked and surprised that my small island has found its way on to my favorite history channel for simple things.
Umm...are you ok oversimplified
God, that ended with a bang.
Dear Mr. Simple,  since when have you been so funny? Sincerely, A thankful viewer
Who here loves the waddle style pig
When will the Vietnam War video come out?
I love how at the end it devolves from a cartoony voice to oversimplifieds true voice. Favorite line of it all is “Cause Bidens coming baby, and this time, he’s coming, WITH A VENGEANCE
Let's Oregon!!!!!! Finnaly something about my state!
This would have been helpful like 3 years ago for me
USA invade Mexico: I feel bad.   USA invade Canada: I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.
I wouldn’t call it a draw when the invading country makes absolutely no territorial gain, loses most of the major battles and gets their capital burnt, but that’s just my opinion.
On the first day of Christmas Oversimplified gave me to me, a video about piggies.
Wait, so the Hey Arnold Movie's (the first one) off-handed comment about a Pig War was *real?*
Yay! New video!
Panzer has never felt so patriotic for the dirty capitalists
I love how many American stereotypes aara on display.
Since when did oversimplified get so biased, ngl for the amount of since your last upload this was kinda garbage.
Biden can barely finish a sentence , none the less go to war with the 2nd biggest nation.
This is what we waited six months for and I am not surprised
Finally after so long
1:20  That roast tho
I will be glad if you make a video about the Ottoman empire or the Rashidun Caliphate. I think it will be an excellent video because most people do not know a lot about them, so it will be an interesting topic to talk about :)
That ending made me a patriotic american even though I’ve never set a foot in america.
The ending of this video made me want to join the US military better than the military's own ads. And I'm already in the US Navy, and coincidentally, I'm on Whidbey Island, where I can clearly see the San Juans and Canada everyday.
You never fail to amuse and make me smile. Your content is amazing and hilarious, keep up the great uploads man!
Joe Biden = Harney reincarnated
I like the star wars reference,i have been with you since last 4 years :)
Title: the pit war Dsmp fans: TECHNOBLADEEE
I laughed way to hard at 14:35
First new oversimplified video since I subbed!
My class just had a test on this ;-;
Ahahahahahahahhaha your canada video
I thought that he was generally horny not general harney.
Gotta buy those plushies so more can come out!
WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETRE!! -An American
The most American thing I ever heard from this video is *"WE MUST INVADE CANADA!!"*
Alright Canada, we like you, and you somewhat tolerate us, so let's band together and get to draining the America out of OverSimplified. The sooner we get him talking about the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the British Civil War, the better.  Yours faithfully, Britain.
I like how detailed Oversimplified are becoming.
This was your best video so far!!
33:22 the best part in my opinion
Manifest destiny or as it should have been called ready or not Indians here we come
Yo i got oversimplified for my birthday!
33:13
Canada: Yeah, Canada is still Canada's Canada.
Oh I’m so happy. Video!
But we can’t invade Canada because they have NordVpn
"You're the one talking to a sheep"
Dude, you must do a video about the basus war, waaaaaay pettier; 40 years.. for a camel.
Wattles is reborn and starts a war.  100% certified true factual
I checked yesterday but today is the day
this guy never fails me to be surprised about this freakin emo nordvpn
cant wait for the next video in 2 years!
You should do a video about the Mormons
3:28 had me dyeing
Still waiting on dat new WW3 video O WAIT ITS STILL 2021 IM  COMPROMISED O SHI-
LETS FUCKINGGG GOOOOOO
Love from india🇮🇳❤
That was worth that wait
He should do a War of 1812 or Mexican American War or Spanish American War or Korean War
My body is ready
The thumbnail is awesome. Make more thumbnails like this.
"Biden's comin' baby"  I don't know why but I find that hilarious
Wait this isnt about Ukraine?
Finally
unironically I am learning about the exact same thing rn in school, and I thinks it's a pretty cool coincidence that this was uploaded at the same time. Like today I finished my homework, opened up YouTube, saw a new Oversimplified upload, clicked on it, and realized it was literally about what I did for homework
It wasn't that the Indians were not white.  The Indians did not have the concept of land ownership.  You are the racist.
Bro, are you okay?
oversimplified can you make a video about the franco-prussian war?
Finallyyyyyyy
Oversimplified, I know you might not see this, but u are making everybodys day great, and it’s such a pleasure to see educational content without it being boring. You are definitely one of the best channels on yt! 😊
Merry Christmas oversimplified because you already made mine, I wish you good luck
3:313
Omg that ending was truly amazing, I am from Canada and I can't stop laughing
I'm american and that ending still scarred me forever
I swear I was just wondering when you'd make a new video.
come at me bitch 🇨🇦
AYEEEEEE HOP IN THE WAGON AND MAKE THE GROUND RUNNING
Wtf did I just watch
how aboot that ending, eh
Greatest Youtuber to touch this Earth for a few reasons. My first reason is because of funny he makes history videos. Like he makes me wanna watch history videos. I even wanna watch his ads like this guy is crazy good at this youtube stuff. If he were to upload a little more no doubt he would have over 10 million subscribers right now.
At first I thought "wait, the brits and Americans went to war twice? but now im like, "piggy died and it cause tension, Germany chose America as the owner of dinky islands"
Isweartobleepingbleepifyouattempttoraiduswewillwalkonyouwithmaplesyrupsandmemeyoufasterthanyoucanreadthissentence
Oversimplify the British and Spanish Colonial Empires
HE UPLOADED!
Ottawa will be renamed to Bidengrad when the star spangled banner rightfully waves upon Parliament Hill.
Can u do Zulu wars next please?
I love you
I want to see a war fought will absolutely no military or government intervention whatsoever. I want to know what happens when civilians go to war against other civilians.
technoblade noises intensify
After that ending i started to wonder if oversimplified guy isn’t some kind of descendent of general Harney.
WHaT tHe f
Are we really going the route of the anti white-colonials now? Seriously OS? Religion meant a lot more than race back then.
I thought this guy died (jk)💀 where did you go, last vid 6 months ago
My man finally back from 6 months
5:53 this guy literally ripped off all of his clothes and dyed his hair blue. That reaction is entirely justified.
33:23 Begins the best moment ever, A+++ Oversimplified
MISSED U SO MUCH
Only oversimplified can make a fucking advertisement worth watching.
Well my fellow Canadians... we did it. We finally got him to acknowledge Canada. But at what cost?
I want to suggest the Philippine American War :DDD
Why does the Berkshire pig  remind me of Waddles from Gravity Falls?
When Oversimplified uploads: *visible happiness*
It takes a long time to make videos
33:20 That is the Funniest Sh*t I have seen (Almost pissed myself)
He’s back!
not even a day ago i checked your channel to see if you uploaded
Yeah we're so evil. Hyperbole in a history video. Definetly not biased or skewed.
Thanks im now scared of america
I haven’t seen the video yet, and somehow I can tell it’s a masterpiece
Very nice
This video almost made me lose my faith in humanity because imagine if we actually started a war over a pig!
Finnaly
Best channel on YouTube
In 100 years historians will be talking about how a war between the US and Canada was started over an internet video.
100k likes in 3 hours
I think it'd be pretty cool to bring Canada into the fold, tbh. Leave Mexico alone though. I like my yearly cheap tropical vacations thank you very much!
bruh 3:30 "america wanted to expand" look at how florida enters
The legend is back!
OverSimplified out here planning to invade canada. But in all reality, i've been here since the WW2 Videos, and even though your upload sceduel is about as put together as the Canadian president, you have still done a lot. Now please, I don't want to age another year before your next video comes out.
BRING IT OOOOOOOON!!!!
Three hours after upload, the video have over 550 000 views, 11 000 comments and almost 100 000 likes. 😎
What. Just. Happened. It was normal until he decided to go into a full on rant about why we should invade Canada. Funniest stuff I've seen in a bit.
I like how one of the first things the Americans put down in new territory is a McDonalds.
as a canadian, I must say that Canada rant at the end, 10/10
Oversimplified needs to go off his hinges more often, that ending was hilarious
This has got to be the greatest video out of all of them, especially the ending!
how do i like this more than once? wtf
That all star reference tho :O
Pls do mexican american war
Being a Canadian just gotta say that was a Awesome ending haha.
Make a video in 1971 india Pakistan war.
The legend is back!
LETS GOOOOOO
Welp, im not so glad to report my college dorms HA had to report me for "extremists tendencies" after hearing about the US conquering the non US above us... thank you oversimplified
At 2:00 I find it hilarious oversimplified says “this perfectly oval-shaped lake”  The Lake of the Woods is literally the most infuriating mess of tiny lakes ever😂  Edit: well I’ve just watched ten more seconds in and my entire comment is invalid :/
BECAUSE BIDENS COMIN BABY!!!
YOOOOOOOOOO
Oh my god, okay everyone it's happening, everyone stay calm
As a Washingtonion, I feel seen
OMG God has uploaded. Must stop my finals studying for this!
oh no i am in copious amounts of fear
As a Canadian legendary end
Hey, I live on Whidbey Island right next to the san juans and even visited San Juan island twice. Never knew this cool history and that some insignificant island almost started a war haha. Its funny because Ive been to Gettysburg too where they did Pickett's charge. So weird
Finallllllllllly
He's back!
7:57 Eminem has been real quiet after this dropped.
HES BACK
another amazing video from OS, he just needed a character at the end saying - *cough "but the commonwealth sir" *cough 😂
NEW VIDEO LETS GOOOOOO
hes back 😀
Just pointing out, the most famous chain from the PNW is Starbucks not McDonalds 😊
Egypt, Sudan and Libia: exists* Europe: 2:57
I do think this is his magnum opus
The real threat is the “I will eat out your eyes guy.”  Fear him.
the second most crapy war in the world.
Pig didn't get Justice, this is soo sad 😞
Its been a while
Honestly I wouldn’t put it past a man who gave free weapons to terrorists to invade Canada
FINALLY AFTER 6 MONTHS
oh god a pig in a dress. Thats gonna haunt me for a while.
He’s back!!!!
Wooooo
Yes you're back
The US and Canada are NOT going to fight each other the way things are now. There would be literally no point to it, and (despite certain attitudes in various Youtube comment sections) Americans and Canadians like each other very much. That is, until the SECOND AMERICAN CIVIL WAR, WHICH WILL PIT THE LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER, AND THE CANADIANS, BEING MOSTLY LIBERAL, JOIN IN TO HELP THE AMERICAN LIBERAL SIDE, BUT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALLLLLL THE GUNS AND WIPE OUT THE LIBERALS - AND THEN THE CONSERVATIVE CANADIANS JOIN THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES AND THEIR COMBINED FORCE DRIVES INTO OTTOWA TO PUNISH THEM FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE - AND THEN THE LIBERAL CANADIANS FIGHT FOR THE DEFENSE OF THEIR HOMELAND, AND THEN YEEEEAHHHH - OVERSIMPLIFIED PREDICTS THE FUTURE!!!!!  Or something like that.
It’s weird how harney is so compulsive and inept during this period but managed to urge the US Congress to honor past treaties with native Americans when he was appointed to the Indian peace commission. The Sioux called him the "man-who-always-kept-his-word." and he helped secure the Little Arkansas Treaty with the Comanche and Kiowa in 1865, the Medicine Lodge Treaty in 1867 and the Fort Laramie Treaty with the Brule Sioux in 1868.
'Murica! Fu-- yeah! 🇺🇸🍔🦅✨
USA USA!
You'd be surprised the number of ridiculous conflicts that happened over small border disputes between colonial Canada and the US. Look up the Aroostook War.
Why does it feel like im searching oversimplified the day before a new video comes out
Some may ask was it worth the wait and I say I don’t care it’s oversimplified
Let's gooo
You guys keep making it out like the British were the reasonable shepherds of map making. History proves over and over and over again...NEVER let a Brit decide where the borders are. .
Thank you so much  for your hard work
HE HAS RETURNED!!!! THE KING HAS RETURNED!!!!!
Chaotic from start to Finish. Good 👍
XD And at that ending, the man finally lost his marbles
Oversimplified vs Canada when?????????????
That is some of the most funniest stuff I've ever seen you're incredible keep up the good work and keep up the good Canadian jokes I as a true Canadian would really appreciate it
This channel is a delight.
Easily the best history channel
Pig war?
I watch every video of yours BIG FAN
Canadians I would see this as a threat of war ;)
I’ve never felt more intimidated by the line “Biden’s coming” 😂
OverSimplified will one day have to make a history video of how he singlehandedly caused the US Invasion of Canada.
Finaallllyyyyy a new upload!!!!!!!!!
Puppies war
Hey mate listen, you need stop smoking weeds mate, here go get some help😉 hahahhaha jk
The plushie is just berd but without a nose, the legs are arms and its less fat
Thanks for letting me snuggle with you
This was made RIGHT after my history test🤣 this woulda helped so much more
Just this morning I wondered: "Hmm, Oversimplified hasn't posted in a while. I wonder when his next video will come out?" and what was I greeted with this evening? A masterpiece.
I respect your work these animations must be really hard to make keep up with the hard work 😁
Wake up babe new Oversimplified video  I don't have a wife but hey, dress for the job you want.
Remember when oversimplified said there's still hope for Joe Biden to become the greatest general maybe oversimplified is predicting the future and remember when he said WW3 coming soon.
Canada won 1812 because we burnt the capital down
r/historymemes is about to get deepthroated by pig war memes
o say does that star spangled
Your alive
that ending tho... is he ok?
What is the ending credits song?
By far one of your more insane videos. Loved it
Those dang Americans just kept coming and won't stop coming
Yikes these faces are nightmare fuel
yes new vid
Yo can you do the greco-persian wars like with leonidas and the 300 Bro that would be AWESOME
...So, as a Canadian, I'm having trouble distinguishing the last 60 seconds of this video from all the other bilious swill of propaganda that have come from south of the border for the last 5 years.  Perhaps others can weigh in: on a scale of eh? to Ah!, how afraid should I be?
Homework can wait for 4 am
Ayo I don't want to be invaded
Shout out to the British Naval Officers for not being idiots
Favorite vid by far.
Videos keep getting better and better!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally a new video im so happy I might cry
37:18  As a Canadian i will %100 support an American takeover. God save the USA!
Wow, your videos just keep getting better. This animation was the best thing I have seen from your channel. Nice work!
As a Canadian, I am now extremely unsettled by the prospect of Oversimplified invading.
General Scott getting mad at everyone reminds me of the scene from half bakrd
But when the world needed him most he vanished.....then he came back
I have honestly had Canadians request that Canada (Alberta specificaly) be brought into the US.
OMG a new video! Clicked play so fast!
30:37 oh yeah this is familiar
Me at 5 in the morning:
12:04 WADDLES!!!!
well, if it helps, you just covered a good deal of canadian history eh(although a video about louis riel would be interesting and from my knowledge possibly quite short)
Lmao! I love your videos as always my man! Nice video! The part where it was revealed that Pickett led Pickett’s Charge was a shocker! Nice videos as always my man! Keep at it! I cannot wait to see what you do next!
0:22 holy shit, Its an nsft!
Looks like Christmas came early!
How the all think it be: "Those people have different skin colors than us, get 'em!" How it actually be do: "Those people aren't part of my group, so I'm going to find something to easily differentiate us so that they can be demonized."  ...and I've been being told it's not okay to be white ever sense, even though we as a species have NEVER stopped doing this.
Jesus christ man, that blown to bits joke was incredible! 25:55 For when I inevitably come across this master piece looking for it
Oversimplified keeps on mentioning the Mexican American war when is doing a video about this war
Is it just me or do the pigs look like they used waddles from gravity falls as a reference?
I swear those keep getting better and better
wow finally a new vid
Good
Muricah
Finally
I thought oversimplified quit YouTube, cuz I dream that he will come back
C’mon boys we’re gonna LIBERATE CANADA!!! MURICA YYEEEAAHHHHH
Might be the best yet
7:57 I see what you did there ;)
this slayed
Why does pickett look like William Shakespeare :)
The last 2 minutes 😭
US withdrawed from afghanistan so they can be completely ready for a war with canada lol
Oversimplified you misspelled destiny and accidentally said density
finally another upload
these videos are more rare than marvel movies and thats why they're great
My body is convulsing in ecstasy as oversimplified uploads a new video
Super
omg ate
"Hey British farm idiot, keep your stupid pig out of my potatoes"  "it is up to you to keep your potatoes outa my pig"  I cant believe he actually said that 😂😂
The ending LMFAOOO
Favorite channel on YouTube!
I kind of want a battle of the boyne oversimplified mentioning king Billy having a picnic in front of the jacobites
I have never seen oversimplified so... mad
Let's go! New Oversimplified!
Here before it hits millions.
"My fellow certified lover boys" -barack Obama II   37:53
That ending made me the proudest I’ve ever been to be an American, and then he mentioned Biden....
I loved the ending
The thing that I was waiting for 6 months!
My God, America please, do t attack canada
31:02 I actually thought he hired Morgan freeman
So the takeaway is this was all Smash Mouths fault... Gotcha
Probably the greatest ending to any YouTube video ever
In alternate universe, Confederate win the civil war and San Juan become a British land with American polulation because Pickett.
When I saw the video drop, I shouted from bottom of lungs : his back
I think the space race might make a pretty ok video if you need ideas
I look forward to a certain history vlogger reacting to this.
Love this video, but my favorite is still The Emu War
That ending got even my roommate’s laughing
I really like what he's taking aboot! this is for the Montreal screw job!
Finally!
Oversimplified is back babyyyyy
Now that's an ending
Let’s go new Oversimplified video
Can you do the Philippine-American war next
Chinese civil war next pls
OS my friend.. its been along time, good to have you back..
My grandpa, a southern Vietnamese once told me that his father use to step on the battlefield of the Vietnam War to stop the spread of communism, and since the Cold War videos, I’m still waiting too learn how my great grandfather has fought the war. (But you still doing great oversimplified, keep up the good work :D)
Mother fuckers really coulnt agree to where they asked the third wheel
One of my favorite ones😂😂
Sleep? Pshhhh I’d rather watch an oversimplified video
RIP Piggy
THE MAN HIMSELF POSTED! :DDDDDD
Ô CANADA !!
36:56 for the beginning of the most BASED conclusion to an Oversimplified video ever
Oddly this is my favorite one so far
Who hear got curve
Saving my ass in APUSH ❤️
HES BACKKKKKKKK (your one of the only channels that make me wanna watch their sponsers)
B2 spirit stealth bombers bombing Buffalo? You’ve outdone yourself oversimplified
He's baaaacccckkkk!!!!
Make a video about vietnam war
“I hear voices all the time.” 😂😂😂
If the USA invaded Canada pretty much the entire world would be on Canada’s side because the USA would have broken the NATO treaty and USA’s enemies would probably take the chance to invade the USA.
OMG OMG HE UPLOADEDDDDDD
I liked how the McDonald's restaurant gets placed onto the land.  Oh, and the ending was, ummm, a bit much, no?  Eh?
Care about your curve that hits hard 😭😭
I hate having to wait for these videos to come out! It makes any day better watching these!
As a Canadian I say: Try us. You'll take Toronto right as the entire world falls to the wayside because if someone's crazy enough to pick a fight with Canada they're too dangerous to leave alive.
OverSimplified editing skills: GOD MODE
Yes
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS NEW VID
great video. as a canadian, I for one welcome the OverSimplified Overlord
And then us Canucks have tons of allies come join our cause and beat you back and the United States is cut off from the rest of the world....hey, if you can have a crazy ferver like that, so can we!
16:37
Oversimplified can you make a video on british india colonial history. It will surely help to increase my grades
Hold up, that scene at 31:00 is like the same scene from The Simpsons when Bart cut that wish-granting fish's guts out. Wait a minute, IS THAT A SIMPSONS REFERENCE!?!
This is honestly my favorite video you've made thus far. The humor is incredible. I can't wait to see what's next!
Christmas has come early
Oh yippie. A new video.
11,015th
3:06 The backstory of Angle inlet
best on yet :D
Pickett. Pickett... why does that name sound familiar? "General Pickett's charge at the Battle of Gettysburg remains one of the most famous moments of the entire war." Oh. Oh. :(
The goat is back
Canada is gonna need Nord VPN after that ending
Literally this guy is YouTube, I watch other videos to keep me occupied until he posts.
As an American I support Canadian America My uncle needs insulin so I’m willing to sacrifice my whole nation because let’s be honest, It’s a shit show now
Everytime he uploads makes me feel amazing. Im getting the plush.
That ending was the highlight of my day, well done OS 👏
I love this so much
Ah yes, britain's side quest of 1812 when the white house turned into the black house, and the main campaign of napoleon dogging on everyone.
A pig ate Lyman's potatoes  This enraged Lyman, who shot the pig severely
I’m so happy I’m going to buy the plushi
Finnally
You guys think you got one dumb motive for war? I raise you the "Comb War", where a dude broke another dude's legs over a comb and three days of riots ensued.
Finally after waiting for a long time
That ending was legit
I will never accept any other opinion other than "the british won the war of 1812"
37:54 I LOVE the absolute spite and anger he puts into that sentence
This ending is the funniest thing ever.
I'm sure Canadians are shaking in there boots about the last part of the video.
Canada goes from “cheerio” to “eh”
Fuck sleep I need to watch this.
33:22 The delivery of this segment is beautiful.
When the premier started it already had 60k viewers lol
This upload made a good day great!
As a Canadian, I feel like after this video I should unsubscribe to prevent Biden from coming.
I wasn't expecting that twist at the end...  Now I'm laughing like an idiot in the middle of the night.
Im sorry, what?
is that the oversimplified BODY pillow
That ending was sick
YO THE LEGEND IS BACK WOHOO
omg yes i love this i need mooooooorrre!
Send this to Biden
the end of this video is the most amazing ending I have ever seen to a youtube video.
Mein I love this channel...that outro and sponsor transition was so clean 👌
28:51-29:19. Basically sums up Buchanan’s Entire Presidency
I live in Oak Harbor and can totally understand why the nearby islands were contested. Great sights and land.
when the world needed him but he returned
As a Canadian in the most respectful way possible I ask that you please don't invade us with your pigs we would never be able to beat you
Please Vietnam
As a true Canadian I'm offended no one's going to take over my beautiful land
nice
Hey oversimplified can you pin this please
YESSSSSSS FINALLLY
As a Canadian... the ending terrified me!
Harney screaming like a little bitch while WinfieldScott beat him with his belt was great.
thx
I’m feeling oddly patriotic after that ending
37:45 The flagpole has the EGYPTIAN eagle on it ?? Will Egypt assist the US in the occupation of Canada?
YESS LETS GO
Why was George so caked up tho?
You should have more Canada in your videos
That end was the best
Love the finale of the video. That’s why I love oversimplified
This escalated faster than an episode of the Simpsons
I'm looking forward to oversimplified looking into Canada's on going dispute with Denmark over Hans island
I genuinely would invade canada.
I still got it
I can't wait to own some Canada
This channel is my strange addiction and I LOVE IT
le Canadians : He mentioned us, He Mentioned us..!!!!
I say Canada is the 51st-57th states more or less and yes I say Canada heath care is can no longer be free
33:25
THE FLORIDIANS ARE LOCKED AND LOADED AND THE ALLIGATOR UNITS ARE SET
Return of the King
14:28 calculator says BOOBIES lol
Officers being idiots I’m glad that doesn’t happen anymore.
The animation just keeps getting better. It's so amazing!!
Just when the world thought he vanished he returened   Everyone 2021
OMG I love everything you create
he's back !!!
I was waiting for a long time
The best way for Oversimplified to roast Canada was to literally acknowledge them in this video.
I missed you
Waw
The king has returned.
38:16 Your Airforce will be met with Hordes of Geese. Your navy will sink beneath a wave of Maple Syrup. Your Armies and Invasions will be pushed back by the Royal Moose Cavalry. And we shall face your marines with the strength of Ten Thousand Drunk, Angry Canadian Hockey Players.
Always a good day when an oversimplified vid comes out
Coming for that Canadian bacon
The pig looked suspiciously like waddles from gravity falls
love the final touch
Yours are the only videos I like on YouTube
he back
Pig war sure is a weird name for Vietnam war
Most American ever XD
Needless to say, that was some serious voice acting
Worth the wait.
that has got to be the weirdest outro sequence i have heard
I have a video suggestion: Lewis and Clark expedition.
D- Did this man actually made an All Star parody in a history video
Geez man, I find the end really offensive. I am Canadian
Middle channel
Oink
5:54 bro how is no one talking abt thisss 🤣🤣🤣
Like vídeo so much
Is this what that one Hey Arnold episode was based on?
YOOOOOOOOOOO
Hah 5318008
Honey wake up oversimplified uploaded again!
I feel people demonize America a little too much in what happened to natives a lot of the wars were started by them and they did just as many massacres
I thought oversimplified discontinued his channel. Very relieved to find a new vid.
Not gonna lie I saw this title and was expecting it to be about the Hatfields and McCoys
Yee fucking haw cowboys 😎
3:53 “I hear voices all the time”
Calm down oversimplified attacking Canada will get the entire world to attack the US and also the US and Canada are allies
The man, the myth, the legend, OVERSIMPLIFIED HAS RETURNED.  4:11 has a heck of a lot of stuff going on. We got them putting down a McDonald's, they are shooting bison, they are building railroads, and then all of the sudden here come 2 b2 stealth bombers to blow up the whole damn thing.
the animation keeps getting better and better !
Alright oversimplified has officially lost it at the end … AND WE LOVE IT
Do Vietnam war next
I wasn't ready for "I didn't say they were WHITE people."
I fear for Canada.
Easily one of the funniest oversimplified videos! Laughed so hard reacting to it, great video! ❤️🧠
You should put your videos with Spanish translation too, I only understand 70% of the things you say
Finally! I've missed you
Ayeeeeee New Oversimplified video
Lots of stupid conflicts happen over fucking manifest destiny....
okay, who wants to bet that the german empire just gave it to the US because they wanted to piss the british off?
It should be a national holiday when Oversimplified posts. A global holiday is the only way to top it
The only reason why I know WW2 existed is this channel
Welcome back king
where do I sign up for the invasion?
12:39 kerbal space program music. Why
Lol love the Canada jab, I’ll sleep with one eye open
THE KING
Oh Canada. Oh Canada! Oh, Canada?
bro thank you i am literaly learning this in my history class
The end out to video was STRAIGHT outta pocket
The “Americanization” of Canada, does have pressident, considering that there are some Canadian provinces that are considering joining the United States (mainly Alberta). And Newfoundland came very close to joining the United States after World War II, but just barely squeezed out a “Join Canada” majority.
I will gladly snuggle Oversimplified every night with that hella fire plushie
I thought he was actually going to show the mole :(
good video
Bro the end lmao
Over simplified is the only channel I don’t skip the adds for
I don’t know if I am mentally ready for this
Day #1 of asking oversimplified to make a video about cuba.
FINALLY! A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO! IM SO HAPPY!
This was a great video in all. I would also consider maybe, a video about the Gulf War next year? It would be cool to see how my dad fought in that war.
I have aids
HOLY SHIT HE UPLOADED
18:50 the animations are amazing
If you blink you'll miss it, but early in the clip, when showing the extension of the border, he carves out the Northwest Angle, arguably the weirdest feature of the border between Canada and the U.S.
This guy just asked America to invade Canada.
Christmas came early
That ending got me having tears in my eyes...   God Bless America.
Its about damn time. Missed u man
i really like the way how you add a little bit of comedic twists in your videos XD
Anyone else watch these a few times when they first come out? I feel like I need to hear it a few times in order to really absorb everything
Why not, oversimplified…why not indeed.  All hail president Drake.
Veitnam oversimplified?
I'm a simple man. I see a new Oversimplified Video, I click.
Me, who took APUSH last year: ah yes, the my love! History!!
YES AMEN YES THE END YES!!!!
Ok that ending was unexpected 😂
That ending was hilarious
That's got to be the best oversimplified I've ever seen and that's saying something. The ending though, oh my God the ending. It's so good I'm rewatching it right now, all glorious 38 minutes and 42 seconds.
Finally
Imagine over simplified movie
Canada is about to get LIBERATED, BROTHER!!!!
where vietnam war
Thank you for covering such a silly American Small War. This was excellent to watch, especially while drunk.
man move from the US  and talk about the Middle East
As one time was said "the best general avoids war"
I am so excited when one of these videos come oit
yes!
The legend is back
yessir a new vid
That ending was the best thing I've seen in years
I hope Nord VPN is paying u the big bucks with all the views you get...
God I love my country.
Next up Mexican Revolution  pls or the Mexican war
I believe yours is my favorite channel in the entire YouTube. I’m always looking forward for your next video!
Excuse me… your spotted what??
holy shit sweet a new vid
It feels so good to wait for so long and then see that a new video was uploaded, I feel so grateful. 🙏🏻
VENGENCE BIDEN
Damn right Canadians you better watch it there’s still land to manifest. We went west but we didn’t go north. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 😂
A war for some pig and potatoes… Not the first time ive heard of this
YOU'RE BACK!!! Finally a quality video to watch while I eat
As a Western Washingtonian who knew none of this, kinda neat to learn a little about the state history.
1. We are more civilized 2. We have free healthcare 3. We respect all religions 4. We live longer (13 years different) 5.  Lower rate of suicide And last but certainly not least We’re better educated. 48.3 percent of Canadians have a post-secondary degree, compared to 40.3 percent in the U.S.
Canada more like North Montana
31:02 Simpsons reference
Yes you’re back!  Miss your video.  I think I watched the old ones over a few dozen times.
Crazy ending
Queen Medb started a war over a cow to win a bet with her husband. So not all that crazy.
LETS GOOO, HE POSTEDDDD
Gallipoli oversimplified anyone?
Oversimplified it's been so long since video please never leave again
Was not ready for that bit about invading Canada.
37:16 James Douglas reaction: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone: Pillaging and destroying other nations and native people, because “God said that we must take and pillage”  This lunacy is still so prevalent today in the U.S.
3:36 notice something Sus under muricas shorts huh..
FINALLY
0:25 me when I saw a new oversimplified video on my tl
That's good and all but when you gonna talk about Canadian history?
Ayo if you ever wanted to cover a incredibly stupid border dispute may I suggest the Toledo ‘War’ it’s the reason Michigan has an Upper peninsula
pisst hey Canada you want to be LIBERATED
Not lying when I say this, but getting an alert for a new video from Oversimplified almost brought a tear to my eye. So excited to watch this video later!!!
Lol  Joe Biden is not doing anything but pooping his pants and making America dumber unfortunately.
*_Finally the man himself shows again with this masterpiece_* 🍷🧐
Ok that ending is legendary, it is so funny to him him yell, this entire video was amazing with so much comedy (pretty obvious seeing the entire situation was RIDICULOUS) the pig gangster was top notch, the facial expression were a work of art, and Scott's attack on Harney was the absolute best I was laughing so much thruout this video, and I'm supposed to be asleep right now  👏👏👏 this is your Mona Lisa, your hall of the mountain king, your perfect video oversimplified. Well Freaking Done. 100/outta 10 will watch until I die
16:01 that's totally unrealistic, the AK 47 is a communist weapon.
The scream at 29:14 has me dying
God bless America
Yessss!!! It's been TOO long!!
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED
That's ending made me proud to be an American we need to invade Canada we need the maple syrup we need the moose we need the rest of Niagara falls. This is how the great American empire begins.
No! I'm trying to study! Why did you have to post now?
YOOO I WASNT HERE FOR THE PRIMIERE BUT HOLY CRAP YOU UPLOADED
Ah the Manifest Destiny
Holy shit, I’m so fucking glad you went all the way in the end
America: Well, that seems like a fair deal. Also America: NO HECKIN WAY!
usa usa usa
YESYEYSYEYSYEYS NEW VID
FINALY….
It was worth waiting this long for a 40 minute oversimplified video
That ending was amazing
The Pig War sounds like a literal movie title.
That whole thing at the end was legendary
Finally a new video after a long time...
“Straight line”  -oversimplified 2021
18:46 *:o*
Hi mr oversimlified im big fan can do veitnam next pls thx u
As a Canadian citizen, consider me very threatened by that ending.
Where did you go????
I don't know what's funnier, the "I didn't say they were White People" joke at the beginning, the pig looking like Waddles from Gravity Falls, or Oversimplified being a supporter of America's Invasion of Canada.
Hell of a speech at the end. I'm convinced.  Let's go take what's rightfully ours!
Pls don't war me I just want to get treated without crippling debt
Yaaayy he posted the best day of the world
And when the world needed him most, he returned
Lmao i laughed at biden's vengeance Bwaj\ahahahahahahahaahahah
Damn I miss your videos!  Great job!  Loved it!
Whoa whoa whoa, I didn't say they were WHITE people. (this literally killed me)
Noway
Jizz what🤨📸
Love the story great scripts tone it down on the cocaine though
7:58-8:06 I have trouble knowing when that reference ended.
I also hear voices all the time.
That ending brought a patriotic tear to my eye. I'm 100% on board with taking over Canada now.
Me, a Canadian and Oversimplified Fan: *panicked screaming*
who else immediately thought of technoblade when they saw the title?
While I watched the part about Joe Biden invading Canada, I honestly have one thing to say..... " If we don't get you, the snow will."
The Oregon Treaty was one of the most stupid things that could have happened in terms of governance of the area (as the recent floods have shown). The border should have been the Columbia River. Straight line bad (west of the Rockies at least).
YAY
Nord VPN?  AGAIN!  Even the ads are oversimplified!
Yay another video to watch 30 times until the next one is released
The ending was the greatest ever.
GIVE UP CANADA YOUR DAY IS DONE!
That ending was so awesome
Can you do the Greek war of independence Or the Greco Turkish war
yes
So this was made in response for more Canada stuff, eh?  Well guess what, more people live in Tokyo, Japan than all of Canada. Also Pixar's new film Turning Red looks really cool and I'm excited for it.
As someone living in Seattle I found it funny how I meet so many people here in Seattle that find the San Juan Islands worthless (we don't hate it like we hate tacoma). Also I'm all for taking Vancouver Island (let the new manifest destiny against Canada commence)
40 minutes man wtf
When that dut dut duuu music comes im like this is going to be brutal
Christmas is Early this year huh?
Oversimplified is the only YouTube creator I would actually buy merch from
Wish I could up vote this 100 times. Awesome story telling. The worst part is we have to wait another 3 to 4 months for the next video.
YOURE BACKKKK!!! We missed you
Also called everyone is an idiot war
You don't include India in your videos
The San Juan Islands are beautiful too.
Pls do one on Yugoslavia
That’s by far the most American thing ever without out saying your American  *let’s invade Canada because why not*
Absolutely incredible.
Nic
"BAAAAAA!!!!"   Not gonna lie, those are some pretty good points.
You made my day @oversimplified
So you are alive. Good to know
Half a year BUT WORTH IT
He posted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love your vids Oversimplified!! Top notch bro 👍
OverSimplified is the only person who is able to make a war over a pig sound interesting
10,329 comment
To anyone who heard the invade Canada part and thinks its a good idea go into the corner and think about what you have done and to anyone from Canada I'm sorry.
I’m Canadian and after watching this video I’ll sleep with a gun under my bed
WAKE UP BABE NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO DROPPED
Never ceases to make me laugh with some good old fashioned humor
So red dead 2 was right that an embarrassed officer is the most dangerous kind.
finally I was close to first
Well now at least Alaska can be part of the Mainland, also don't underestimate Canada, they never lost a war (I'm kidding, of course.)
Mans got RHYMES
I live in canada and when oversimpified said those words I was shocked :c
i thought i was dreaming when i received the notification for this video
"Patriotism reaches Ottawa liberating levels."
A little too much about taking native Americans land. Getting a little woke are we
Ok...  We all gotta admit That pig totally wasn't based on Wattles from Gravity Falls   There is absolutely no way.
4:14 put THAT on a shirt
Yeeeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
33:23 had me dying of laughter at this part
Yessss!!! I swear to god I cried!!! I was just so happy!!!! Oversimplified posted!!!
4:22 props for capitalizing God
I appreciate 3 hours after release it's over half a million views
3hours 500k views that’s amazing
10 days later:  *BREAKING NEWS ON CNN!!!* *CANADA TO BECOME 51ST STATE?*
Please come manifest destiny America -a Canadian
4:11
37:15 bro that ending 😂😂😂
Just damn This channel really focus on quality over quantity
I would support biden if he invaded Canada, that Albertian oil will be ours. That time gm made the thunderbird in Ontario well that will be no more. Ameruca will finally take its place as the largest country that produces the most oil and owning the most mines. and will also be the sole home of the brown bear. take canada take canada. we know the niceness is the a cover for you plans to do evil.
My guy just went off on Canada
wait... where is technoblade in this war
Finally another great war video from the animator OverSimplified! *raising arms in the air from like the animations he would do*
Yo, stay away from Canada man, i mean it 🔪
upload more I was starting to think that you were dead
After that ending, I have the sudden urge to manifest some destiny in Canada..
I love you oversimplified
You right, we should take Canada
38 minutes let’s gooooo
god has fallen from the heaven
Thanks for making great videos 👍
I wanna invade Canada now for some reason
YAY a new oversimplified video
38:16 Subtitles: He's coming with avengers!!!!
24:20 He didn't even serve the ball into the service box, nor was he behind the base line when doing so.  My guy, that's not a war plan, that's a fault.
Yaa baby world war three IRA tactics Vietnamese forces EU vs USA ya baby I not even napalm will keep you warm in the winter let’s goooooooooooooooo Thanks for talking about Canada 🇨🇦 tho bud
Interesting.         That's all I can say about the ending
I was totally not expecting that ending. This is Oversimplified's way of getting revenge against the Canadian commenters. They got what they deserved.  Edit: Okay, maybe not all the Canadian commenters.
It’s always a good day when he uploads
It appears that the creators had to much maple in the making of this video.
uh, oversimplified, you okay there buddy?
he is back boys
Where was my notification YouTube
I always try and predict what the next oversimplified video will be. Vietnam? The Korean War? The industrial revolution? Perhaps the Black Death, or even operation desert storm?   Nah, pig war bro.   Well played oversimplified. Well played indeed.
AT LAST NEW VIDEO!!!!
ah finally the time has come.
That ending tho 👑
Day just got better from this upload
0:47 lmao
I seriously doubt as an American that Biden has the mental cognitive ability to avenge anything.
Glad to have a new video from you dude this was was amazing and that ending Jesus I was in stitches
When he was needed most.. He.. Fanished = F- When he was needed most.. He.. Appeared = A+
Resume of the video "Get out of my property"
Absolutely love this channel!!!
pig fight
eyyy a new upload
Hey bro can you try marshal law of philippine history pls
Me and my friends: Ok... past 3 uploads have been good... I wonder what will be next? Spanish civil war? War of 1812? Vietnam war? Oversimplified: Best I can do is pig
I noticed pickett’s name from Pickett’s charge, but I didn’t actually notice that it was the same person
I AM SO FRICKIN HAPPY
The end lolololololo
LET'S ANNEX CANADA YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
As hilarious as this is, and it is, I'm hoping OverSimplified is not beginning to become anti-American in his videos. Something about this video just sorta... sounded like he did not like America. Maybe it's just me.
a lot better then my teachers explaining
Where have you been ive given up hope but yet you returned
37:13... next is mexico
that ending from oversiplified not expected
BIDEN’S COMING BABYYYY!!!!!!!!
I love this video!
Christmas Aaasssss
"Could America still invade Canada!?"  ...Well, yeah, but...  Why would we?  It'd be a waste of time, violate, like...  30 bazillion treaties and agreements, and overall just be a bad idea.  I'd love to have Canada and the USA become one unified country...  Hell, I'd love Mexico to join in on that, as well.  The United North Americas.  UNA.  I'm sure someone could come up with a better name, but...  Back on topic, that just ain't gonna happen.  Neither the invasion, nor the unification of North America.  In short:  Yes, we could.  We might even win.  But, long term?  Flat-out bad idea.
Did someone say that shrodingers cat spoke to God?
Nord vp are the goats for sponsoring oversimplified 🤤
Idea: we give Americans our singers and we get back our hockey players whose with me.
1 min they have phones the next minute it takes 6 weeks to mail something.
Anyone else wish there was a bloopers section?
Thank you so much. I really needed this today.
Video on Mexican-American war?
Let Jesus Christ be with you all amen
The phantom piglet Attack of the bacon Revenge of the pigs
What's the music playing when the Americans show up?
Oh shit! Oversimplified posted!!!!!
We went into Iraq and couldn't make gas cheaper. Going into Canada wouldn't make maple syrup cheaper...sadly.
If America invaded Canada 🇨🇦 Canada Canada wouldn’t be independent nation
His videos are never a disappointment
My lord has returned
As someone who is Canadian all I can say to that (American invasion) Is F U! First of all even though yes the Americans have the military advantage there's no way that the UN and Britain esp would allow that thereby u would end up pissing off a lot of the other Canadian allies who would most likely join Canada in a defense movement but also U'd probably get my dad kicked out (he's a landed alien meaning he retains American Citizenship but lives in Canada) so please don't.
Finally new content after oversimplified ran out of ideas
have to admit that this video made my day better.....
I wondered when you were gonna cover this
Please don't give Biden any crazy ideas. He is stupid enough to actually try it.
I’ve visited the San Juan Island National Historic Park multiple times before while visiting relatives. They have both the English and American camps open for folks to visit, for those interested.  I saw “Pig War” in the title like “is that referring to what I think it is?”
"Hey hey hey...I didn't say there were white ppl" 😂
Pls no start war with canada. I love them
Love the ending
The ending🤣🤣🤣
Dude I'm begging you, please make more content, PLEASE. IDEAS: ww1 remake (longer), Vietnam war, Korea war, Iraq war, Afganistan war, Bosnian war. Please make those and be objective please.
Did anyone else realize the pig is just Waddles?
Wowowowoowow upload dong
HE’S BACK
He's back in townnn
37:16 as a Canadian this is the most cursed thing I’ve ever seen
As a canadian living in a tourist trap border town I can say without doubt that I was firmly rooting for the british this entire video.
Let's go, I love his content
This is one of the best yet.
Coincidentally we talked about how cowardly and spineless Buchanan wasn't history class today.
There's a weird cut at 25:36 that just completely skips over some script
I mean…..I think In the end….he may have lost it
7:58 smashmouth
Here we go again
As a Canadian that end was absolutely gold, that was hilarious and if I see one person offended I will use all the maple syrup flowing in my veins to revoke their citizenship with an overly bent hockey stick!
14:04 best oversimplified quote off all time
If you guys attack canada you will be in for one hell of suprise
This was the most well animated video yet!
OH YEAH ITS FINALLY TIME TO TAKE CANADA! TO WAAAAARRRRRR!!!
Bruh... you forgot Canada
We've been blessed with an early Christmas present from oversimplified
Oversimplified: you say we don't talk about Canada enough? (Begins to threaten them for 2 minutes)  Canadians: Yay they are talking about us
Next can you do the life of Jesus or Julius Caesar?
at 9.41 I live on one of those islands
Since when did this guy become an anti-America guy. I'm not even American and it's getting annoying.
i love the rant at the end
Heyyy, I was just checking a few days ago if you uploaded glad you’re back!
Cool to see a video about something so close to where I live
"Woah, Woah, Woah. I didn't say they were white people."
Finally new video
Do an episode on Australia 🇦🇺
YES THE PIG WAR
You guys want to invade Canada? That went well last time you tried didn't it?
OMG
American here, I can reassure to the Canadians that Biden will be doing one thing. And that thing is ruining America. So you can sleep with both eyes closed,
King's return.
Ok we can all agree oversimplified spiraled out of control in the last 60 seconds
That ending tho
Love all your stuff. Very interesting video from my state that I didn't know about.  And Steamy Mc Steam Face. HAHAAH
Waited for 6 months. Didn’t disappoint!
Really after 3 month you give us a pigs😀
Oh my God a newvideo!!!!!
Do you want to start the American Canadian war, LONG LIVE CANADA 🇨🇦 ALL HAIL ME (I'm not Trudeau)
That pig walk cycle is the most cursed thing I’ve ever seen
worth the wait 100%
Thanks for the early Christmas present OverSimplified!
YES!!! Was just thinking how much i wanted a new simplified video
The flagpole bit I love as it seems to be the best spite play. You may have taken the island, but we still have the flagpole.
NEW VIDEO LETS GO

I'd love to see the Texan war for independence on one of these, I just find it cool to learn about
I love the end

I love you
16:00 in order to stay thematically true to the canon, please use an AR-15 instead of AK-47 haha
The man the legend has return
Excellent.
Once again, quality over quantity
Draw my arse, you fail to push and we burn down your leader’s residence, sound like a pretty steep Anglo-Canadian victory
please don't invade Canada
When the world needed him most       *He returned*
Well, I certainly hope Biden’s insurance covers...  Fire damage     (Great video btw, always happy when there’s another Oversimplified video)
now that's ending i like to see
Bro were you dead or wot why is there a video after morning months5
Oversimplified and Casey come back in the same day? What a good day
No notification? So sad
Was literally watching the second part of the Napoleonic Wars earlier wishing to get another video
i totally havent been repeat binge watching these videos for the past 6 months. this is probably the best one yet!
Please do the Great Depression next
ㅇㅁㅇ
FINALLY
best one yet
woo new upload
New oversimplified videos and a bowl of popcorn mix well
37:19 Oversimplified goes patriotic mode 100%
What about pigs vs emus?
Any chance of a Russian Baltic Fleet episode in the future? Both this and that are a nutcase story in itself.
At 0:47 I laughed way too hard. Also, I didn’t know they made a video about yo mother.
Ah yes, straight lines on a map totally mean stable and nonviolent things happened after that line’s creation.
Still waiting for the oversimplified Vietnam war
Can you do a video on the Mexican and American war
That ending tho..
reconstruction next please
It's always a good day when OverSimplified uploads.
USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸
Hey you leave Eel slap alone, its done nothing wrong
This. Was. Amazing.
Lets goo
"It is up to you to keep your potato's out of my pig" - farm tzu, master of cattle
Oh no, oh no, OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Wtf Ami going to do. What is that music....... Wait, NOOOOOOO
Excuse me, but I think if America tried to invade Canada we would have a whole bunch of countries ready to back us up against America lol
Y'know, that end has me concerned about oversimplified
You're only jealous of Canada's tighter gun laws.
HE FINIALLY POSTED AGAIN AT 9:54 AT NIGHT IN MY TIME ZONE WOOOOHOOOOOOOO
imagine the US really starts a war with Canada and invading it over an Oversimplified video
Finally a new oversimplified video!
Initially I thought it was about technoblade potato war lol 😂
33:28 to 33:36 that made me laugh so hard!! LOL
7:58 top 10 rappers Eminem was too afraid to diss
Oh hey the king is back
Watch your back Canada, watch your back!  37:15
Oh boy... Myself in Montreal I do not know how to feel about the end of the video... Lmao glad to see another of your amazing videos!
whoa whoa this voice tho
That was the most American ending I have ever seen XD
I fear people who would not understand satire...
What if Canada and England team up on us and we become… The United States of Canada??. 🇨🇦 🇺🇸 🇬🇧
imagine a war getting triggered by a youtube video
I was here.
🇨🇦San Juan island is rightfully Canadian clay.🇨🇦  That closing rant made me uneasy
While I was listening to this while working, I thought that I already reached the end of the video, but when I heard the ad, oh my. This is gonna take a while. And I'm loving it!
The ending tho
1:26 he got roasted
Vietnam War  Video Reference  15:50 look at the map beside American officer
We should conquer canada and then trun to mexico
I can get with drake as president
anyone else would have just killed the pig and the cooked it for dinner and the forget about it?
The only problem for you is the cold
Why would you give people the idea to invade Canada? This is why we have had two World Wars.
U-S-Eh ….. you’ve convinced me as a proud Canadian… make it happen
When a youtube video explain a school lesson  that takes a whole semester to finish in a single video. Thankyou oversimplified! Vietnam war soon?
Welcome Back!!
Hi
This is your best video yet
The ending was worth it
This is actually the best representation of Canada on the entire internet. The ending in particular.... chefs kiss
Top quality during the dark times
I legit the last couple of days been watching all your old videos wondering where the hell you went!!! Thank you for coming back!
Yes, the video quality is up, but at a cost of oversimplified's sanity going down.  P.S: Pls do the Vietnam war next :))))
Soooon fo my
37:22 uh didn’t America have like 6800 nukes
Beautiful ending. Put tears in my eyes
Every day is a gift from now on Canadians, sleep with one eye open ;)
I feel like we left Britain for a reason and should have taken all of Canada. Every country has stupid things and atrocities. Especially the Brits. Especially canada. Especially the Indians. Not gonna get any sympathy from me when dealing with inching the Brits out of territory they should have known the US would have grabbed.
Thank you for uploading after I got graduated, met a girl ,married her had children, turned 50 and had grandchildren.
The random McDonald's were the best part
YESSSS! More Oversimplified! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! \o/
2:49 Oh hey! It's the guy who's definitely average height for the time!
Thanks for talking about Canada 🇨🇦
I’ve been waiting
Hell yeah my boy finally returned with the milk
Oh hell yeah!
I like how he actually gets the rank insignia right
He has returned!
Canada does have sexy curves
LESSS GO POGGERS
Next Video On The Life Of Joseph Stalin plz
mk
Over simplified plush do be drip 🤧🤪😎😤
We shall MAKE CANADA AND US ONE COUNTRY TOGETHER
all star reference at 7:55
BIDEN IS COMING!
That ending  It's me playing Hoi4, literally
Biden's always coming.
I live in Canada, and just imagining this video inspires Americans to take over Canada.. yeah…
Im mexican and i think the best part is And the british buen out the white house
OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!!!
Purple
This is funny video to the end.
San Juan island is rightfully Canadian clay.  That closing rant made me uneasy
It's OKI agree with you about conquering Canada but  We are not going to have it with Joe Biden hes not the president everyone knows the 2020 election was 20 election was weighed it's Donald Trump and by God Dang if you don't we do this with trump we will bring the United States enclave army🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸
FINALLY
I don't know when I am going to see him again.
I was NOT ready for 4:10
impeccable vidéo
Watch your tone.  your friend Canada
🇨🇦  Bring it.  GREAT episode!
You should do the Australian Eureka Rebellion. Its a pretty interesting topic!
Canada is one big hiding place
These videos just keep getting more and more wacky and I love it!
Hi
Best one yet!!!!! Thank you for continued video’s!
How convenient this comes out hours after i finished watching the war of the bucket oversimplified
Is back!!!!!!
FINALLY YOU UPLOAD OMG
This is hands down my favorite video!! That ending was truly spectacular!
Hahahahah please i want to be american
Welcome back!
As a Canadian i appreciate this
You should really talk more about Brazil in your videos
16:36 lol
11:55 1369 OMG 69 nice
Even six of them? I only see five
6 months
The ending was very based.
He's back
With me being a Canadian, the end made me laugh so much. One of the best videos so far.
Yay new video
Hell of a job with the animation!!
@oversimplified chrismas truce on christmas?
i just noticed that a pig is smarter than a dog
4:12 this made me salute. At the same time, I know it was wrong.
Personally, I think this is the best video ever created.
Sick
us canadians still dominate pancakes and waffles with our SCRUMPTIOUS syrup
Outro was 12/10 xd
1. Your crazy 2. What the heck???
The ending is making me very worried about the creator of these videos and if he’s doing alright
Yep we did land to the Civil War.
is it too much if i ask for a texas revolution an an annexation of texas?
Love the video
why did i get hyped when you said we were awarded the islands
33:20 best part of the vid right there
Science:proves that pork is unhealthy and causes and memory damage Everybody:oh yeah this is worth starting a war for
If it really was a scheme, then William S. Harney's mistake was assuming that the British would react the exact same way that he would.  Unfortunately, the British weren't composed solely of blithering idiots like Harney, so...
Holy shit that ending XD
Make Canada American! Canada for the 51st state!
I just want there to be a oversimplified modern era where there is a museum where historians ponder over the existence of this one blue haired individual named nord, or a bunch of people thinking the nord character is some Illuminati equivalent and the dollar bill just has the nord vpn person on the back.
No not Biden
Could you do a video on the mexican Independence or mexio history?
Uh oh its war time Baby!!!
He’s so much different and more confident. Love it and the ending!
It’s lifting hear that few people (the cool headed ones) prevailed and prevented a careless war. One thing I was told in the politics faculty of my uni was; ‘it is those few, those calculated, controlled and cool headed who can stop terrible incidents like war. Who are able to impartially analyse a supposed strategy by government and be able to say “I don’t agree with that plan,” because of so and so. ‘   It’s these kinds of people, who every once in a while show a little humanity, understanding and caution, which have protected history and humanity.
INVADE!
:o
pog
Well that has to be the fastest someone descended into madness making a video.
awww i was late i had a test great news i passed my class
I’ve been waiting for an upload for so long, yay
The ending is just hilarious
Brilliant episode! But as a Canadian I must ask that you instead concede that Trudeau, although a halfwit, isn’t a 8th-wit like the rest of your presidential candidates. So let us Canadians invade America and you, mister oversimplified, will get free healthcare. Same to you other American reader of this comment. Everyone gets free health care!
I found the most surprising part that general Pickett commanded troops on San Juan island which was the same guy who got one of the most famous charges of the civil war named after him, even though James Longstreet oversaw the charge and some credit him with the failure of the doomed charge. The video was so satisfactory after a six months wait, and was superb quality with the sublime remix being mentioned by FRH Gaming, which I noticed in the video, and was pretty good.
RETURN OF THE KING
I see now, the entire video is just to try and promote for the invasion of Canada. I mean it makes sense. The only thing between us and Alaska are those Canadians…
God Bless America
I love your videos!  Please never stop making them!
This animation is top tier
hello
yesss finally
As a Canadian I am both laughing my ass off and flipping you off. Fantastic job, Oversimplified. Wonderful video.
I never laughed so much with an Oversimplified video. True masterpiece
Just this morning I was like huh, it's about time that Oversimplified released another video., Guess I was right!
Finnaly you aploud a vid after 6 months.
Can you do the Mexican-American war
Can you please do the Eureka stockade oversimplified
Holy cow
What is spotted dick 7:16
Wake up babe , oversimplified posted
LETS GO THANK YOU OVERSIMPLIFIED
me: Omg it’s office hour, I’ve got a deadline approaching  oversimplified uploaded a video  also me: *watch the video anyway and said I’ve got computer issue*
Do a war of the ear vid
I see no dislikes, Canada is USA now?
that ending hit me like a freight train
This Anger Winfield Scott who punsihed Harney severely
It always makes my day 10x better when one of your videos come out thanks for the amazing entertainment!!!
yo
The only way to make that more patriotic is to refer to America as gods land
Its been awhile
New video ideas: 1: Roman Empire 2: Alexander the Great 3: War of 1812 4. Arab-Israeli Conflicts 5. Vietnam War 6. Russian Civil War 7. Korean War 8. Seven Years War 9. German/Italian Unification 10. War on Terror
Oversimplified is the best YouTube channel ever
19:08 For a moment there I thought Griffin will turn into John Wick lol
Before this video I thought it was more likely that Canada would invade America in its current weakened state, but now after watching this video     MY OPINION HASN’T CHANGED A BIT!!!😂🇨🇦
I’m so happy the legend is back
37:14 and with that oversimplified history was the cause of Britain Canada and America going to WAR
By far, the funniest oversimplified video, I have ever seen.    Please read this and pause for one second for ever coma
We're comin' for ya, eh? lol
I am deeply scared that USA will soon invade Canada as a Canadian.
Canada’s had it too good for too long.
That ending was epic!
So we gonna leave the task of invading Canada to Biden??? The guy could even handle a WITHDRAWAL from Iraq he would probably mess up so bad Canada would win.
At this Point 12:54 this man humor rivals that of Sam o Nella I am the only person who wants to see a collab of them
finally a new oversimplified video.
Yesssss
Just yesterday i was watching again the civil war oversimplified and was thinking about when you would publish a new one. Really great !!!!
thank you nord vpn
i would say we could take over canada, but we got biden, harris, and general milley. it wouldnt end well for us
He's Back
The end of this video was the biggest twist in Oversimplified history
This is the craziest video I've ever seen     But I liked it
When did Oversimplified get my AOE2 strategy for negotiating peace for the sheep in this?
I legitimately support the annexation of Canada by the United States of America
I love his videos
You uploading vids is like a rare event
im exciting as heck when i received notification by him :D
HE'S BACK, THE LEGEND IS BACK!
President who?  Oversimplified: “president polk”
Porky and spuddy is the collest thing ever! So underattedddd
Thanks OverSimplified for finally presenting a fair representation of an important event in Canada-US history! Very simply, nearly everyone involved we're idiots.
Is no one talking about the sheriff  scene? That had me rolling!
The mans back and ready to attack
the end of the video happens and i can't stop laughing
Oooh ya I wanna sleep with a YouTuber who talks about war and random dumb wars
Anyone: "God said..."  And suffering then ensued.
That ending was crazy
As a Canadian... I feel like if Americans were to invade they would eventually just get sick and bored of our shitty weather...
love ittttttttttttttttttttttttt 3 hoursssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Do Anglo-Indian Wars
The only creator who I don't skip the ads to
Funniest one yet!
Hello oversimplified im jonahgil filomeno,,, i want you to create the history of the philippines            i wanna see my country biography,,,,
Welcome back!
Do the shortest battle in the world
Omg the ending was awesome!!!!
I love your videos
This one was a trip
Yo the Legend is Back!
Don't worry Oversimplified, we'll get Canada in 2076.
Oh no! I’m sorry America! I guess to calm you guys down we should skyrocket health care prices. 🇨🇦
HE POSTED!
damn I'm early
As an American curled up in a heated blanket after a day of snow removal, no one is invading Canda. It's our Russia. Also let's not give Drake any ideas, as seen by Ted Cruz the whole born in the US is more of a guideline. Rihanna as VP though....
I feel bad fore charles the pig man
You are still a libe
OMG YOOOOOOOO
Yugoslav wars next!!! please
America: Invades Canada  America two seconds later: "hey look its the entire commonwealth, they must be going on a cruise or something cause there sure is a lot of them.....why are they getting closer"
Drake for president!
I absolutely love these videos... but it's not oversimplified anymore...
Ah yes, the war of the pigs 👁👁                                                 🐽                                                  U
AMERICANS INVENTED EVERYTHING. BACK IN THE YEAR 10000 BC A PROUD AMERICAN CREATED A LANGUAGE KNOWN AS "AMERICAN" (Absolutely Magnificent Exuberant Republican Innovation that was Created And Named)  THAT YOUNG MAN BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT. GOD BLESS OUR STAR-SPANGLED BANNER. GOD BLESS AMERICA
How do these videos keep getting better?
the man the legend does it again
27:28 I spent to long seeing if he actually changed the islands color.
I was so stoked when I saw that you posted a new video this finna be a banger 🔥💯
Finally
Imagine if oversimplified neighbours called the cops because they got 33:32 mixed up as domestic abuse
Why did the ending get me so gassed up to invade Canada, like I'm fired up.  Got me wanting to enlist so bad rn.
lol great video
Hi
I'm just passed the 4:10 mark, and I can tell this video is about to be legendary.
I love oversimplified if he was my history teacher I will not be a sleep
6:31 I think this has been copied from Jay Foreman
Technoblade never dies.
As a broader state next to Canada. They are just out 51st but socialist (yuck) state 🤷🏻‍♂️
We were all out here waiting for the 'Nam war and he rolls out with some pigs rolling in cow poop.
You say about the pig what about the potatoes huh! POTATOES LIVES MATTER!!
I swear that pig looks like its from gravity falls
Oversimplified: Lyman... shot the pig Me: *gasp*
Indo pak war 1971 PLZZ🇮🇳
WAR OF 1812 NEXT
GOD BLESS AMERICA, CANADA WILL BE OUR GREAT 51 STATE
Yoo
I was doubting if he was American at all until the ending here
As a fairly new oversimplified fan this is the first time he has uploaded something new since I subbed and I am SO EXCITED 😆
Did anyone else think this was a technoblade video from the thumbnail...
I don’t think Americans could take over Quebec, maybe Canada but Québécois people are extremely aggressive so
We join together on this glorious day, that comes only every couple months, but what a day it is, I shall celebrate and host a festival!
I love it!
I though Russia would invade Canada?
Biden on his next nation address . We’re at war with Canada 🇨🇦
The ending tho
do the war of 1812 next
Oversimplified's upload gaps are over the moon 😏     Jk. Iove you and your videos! :D
Vietnam War next!!!!
o>o>o>o>o>o>o>o>o/o/
Me as a Mexican seeing OverSimplified getting closer to Mexico: "Ya nos cargo el payaso"
War of 1812. A """draw""". Bitch, please. *America got curb-stomped* and *President Madison was left in hiding while his own people mocked him.* The war only ended because a hurricane hit Washington D.C., sending the Brits fleeing.
This was the best video to date
this is great
I so want him to do the chrismas truest
You should talk about Canada more
bro you have to do "Men who Built America"
tbf if biden invaded us we would be to polite to fight back
Wtf
15:45 I’m almost sure that there is a map of Vietnam which is probably what oversimplified is working on next
Lmao that ending
The last 2 mins deserve its own video
Anyone else just watch oversimplified to see the honey or Nord VPN sponsorship drops?  P.S. excuse me, Washington is not the middle of nowhere. -average washingtonian.
Early
Hes baaavck
Anyone think the sheep scene and the ending were the best scenes we’ve seen? Their unique and hilarious.
bruh this whole video is a lol moment
Because the noble savage was just so perfect. Bigot
37:17 well I actually already made plans to move to Germany so I'm chilling
Hes baaavck hhhe ffucckingg baackk yayyyty
Finally you are alive
Literally introduced my mother to OverSimplified today and said "he usually uploads every six months so he's due for a video" and lo, 2 hours later.
the king has updated
War if 1812 in a nutshell:  British press gangs basically kidnapping American merchant sailors, and American politics used this as an excuse to invade British Canada.  The campaignnwas a disaster, and the brits had no means to seriously retake the nation
Not the curtain again
Well worth the wait
yes
As a Canadian I am definitely both dying and gasping for air with that ending.
pls make a video on russian revolution!!!!!!! plss
Yay a new video I love these
The Return of the King.
Whatcom was pronounced wrong.
Best moment 33:29
0:50 No, he didn't say they were "white people", but they then went off and fought a shit ton of other white people (French, Spanish etc.), and other tribes that were killing and conquering other tribes for centuries prior.  3:58 No, we didn't "make it up to (insert contrived liberal narrative thats void of any historical accuracy)", the conquering of the lands to the west were the same as any other tribe or nation. We wanted the resources, and we took them. Surprise surprise, every nation on the planet has done this. The fact that you're accusing only white Americans is intellectually dishonest. Point the criticism the other way (to the native indians and mexicans further south) and suddenly everyone gets upset.  Make a series about the continual wars between native tribes among themselves and with the mexicans, then tell me how bad the Americans were for doing the exact same thing they've been doing for years. Also tell us how our conquest was purely about race and how we should be ashamed for being white. That'll do it.
I’ve started getting a 6th sense for these uploads. I just got into rewatching some of these videos the last few days cause I knew a new one had to be coming soon. And this is a fun one!
Nothing could prepare me for the sheer intensity of Oversimplified's ungodly patriotism at the end.
N-new video
Canada is better than America in my opinion. So shove it
Canada is a much better country then U.S.A
36:57 That ending section got me
I’m now glad to say I was here before it was trending.
finally after months of waiting he has blessed us again(also NordVPN is running out of money sponsoring this dude XD)
Oversimplified blesses my eyes with holy knowledge of the old earth.
This is the most historically accurate portrayal of James Buchanan that I've ever seen
Let’s go a new one
Why do you hate America so much
Lmao by far the best video
Ok that was Epic
This is the best animated video I have ever seen on this channel
FINALLY
Britain was not world's greatest naval power till they came to trade for india and captured it by coward methods
It's funny because I've been binging your channel and realized I wouldn't be getting any new content 🙁. But I see you're back and I couldn't have joined at a more perfect time 😄!
I too feel as if Canada shall be annex by the US. Glad others share that sentiment. Get ready boys we ride at dawn. Or actually noon. I dont want to get up that early
The man the legend has returned
I do not see any reason why the US has to invade Canada. Oversimplified might think "it's fun to put in" or something, but the scene actually loses the goodness of Oversimplified.
Hate to be that guy but I’m pretty sure if you gave joe Biden a map and a compass he wouldn’t be able to tell you where Canada is, to all the Canadians in the comments section y’all are safe for now
im so supisred
A 30 minute video?? This makes me feel like he’s not gonna post for a loooong time again.
So we doing this America?
I always get a little happier and a little smarter every time I hear “this video was made possible by Nord VPN”
hes baaaaack
As a Canadian watching that last part. All I could think about is the “shiver me timber’s” meme 😂
Hey do Vietnam next
As a Canadian: Please don't invade us America, or else I'm going to eat your eyes.
Everytine Oversimplified uploads a video: “You’re as beautiful as the day I lost you”
"I hear voices all the time." LMAO 😂
Technoblade's potato war would be quite funny if posted by oversimplified
Let's invade Canada baby!
Uttering the words “Vancouver island” summoned me from the depths of hell to say... “I live there!”
Rip that pig.
That last minute took a turn there
26:30 Steam McSteam Face. ah a call back to a classic lesson on why you don't let an internet poll make big decisions for names... or anything for that matter.
Nah, we would clap us in a 1v1
Ok ok heres the plan when they cone oversimplified makes shorts
Ok so basically this war started when a fanfiction of Charlotte's Web and Old Yeller became canonized.
Now it's confirmed that oversimplified's girlfriends are nord VPN and honey
Pls do some Indian history
BLAME CANADA!
The war of Technoblade
New video!
I'm on mushrooms and when Morgan Freeman was the pig I actually stopped and had to look around to make sure I was actually awake lmfao
I just couldn't stop smiling. This here is truly quality content.
Even though this video made America seem like crazy people I loved it. 🥲 Gives me that patriotic feeling. Because josh darnet we are all crazy and amazing!  USA USA USA! 🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲
Once again, Christmas has come early just like how he uploaded last December
Men the ending was just WHOLESOME
I love this channel so much it actually makes history...fun
This video made me proud to be an American
Hi @oversimplifed a recommendation for another video maybe after your Vietnam project do one for Africa esp during the colonial era (1860-1980) and I could get you data from local museums compared against Wikipedia and am sure it would make a good 3 part video ...I could help you with data from Eastern and central Africa
Please do Thirty Years' War! That would be awesome!
We just need to take down Canada’s Geese Air Force and their moose battalion . Soon Canada will become north Montana
The British burned down the white house?😦 Ha! Take that you Jan 6th pussies!😁  Merry Christmas All 🎄☃️🙏👍🇺🇲👈👌 Let's Go Brandon 😇
This is the funniest video yet😆😆😆😆
15:05 bookmark
Oversimplified is oversimplified
This got personal lol
Waddles is that you?
5:52
The amount of happiness that overloads my body when I see a new Oversimplified video is immeasurable.
I am Alpharius
That seems like a radical thing biden would do, but then again he probably would fall asleep and forget about it all.
Who new that the pig was Morgan Freeman in disguise
RIP, ye olde Waddles
Isn’t it pretty weird to see my hometown in an Oversimplified video, eh? Keep up the amazing work bud!
woo
3:55 I hear voices all the time too! So glad I'm not alone
Yes
Petition for Oversimplified to do the Spanish Civil War next
The cinematography is magnificent. A true magnum opus. I don't know how it can be outdone.
please tell me im not the only one that noticed the Fallout 4/76 Combat Shotgun the rat was holding at 3:42
THE KING IS BACK
His video production is getting better and better by videos
Where's vietnam?
OVERSIMPLIFIED IS BACK. Could we have more frequent uploads perhaps?   ( This is a lottery for people who create 'Oversimplified out of context'.)
Honestly thought Morgan Freeman was voicing the pig for a minute
Hmmm A pig and potatoes now who does that remind me
Lets gooooooo
Based Thomas Jefferson
This reminds me of a Minecraft war over a dog.
YAYYYY FINALLY A VIDEO 🥺🥺
Where’s the Vietnam oversimplified
**The Ending of the Video skit**  James Douglas is rolling in his grave, and I am rolling on the floor laughing
kanye 2024
I waited 6 months to get this masterpiece!!
Was this Pickett the same one in Pickett’s charge?
premiered 3 hours ago.....already has 455k+ views.....sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet boi
I swear to God, i joined your discord server And there wore so many fucking neo Nazis and i had to leave, you gotta fix that shit bro.
Living in the same house as your Ex = US sharing the Oregon Territory with Britain. That analogy is so perfect on so many levels
Yeee
Am I the only one who notices how oversimplified went from no cursing to "who the hell are you" and "what the fu-!"
Bro OS is OP. Love the vids
Thats a Top 5 video ending right there
Ya why can’t we invade Canada
World War 2 oversimplified: 29 minutes The Pig war oversimplified: 38 minutes
Me and my girl just broke up so I needed this
that ending though
The ending was the best.
So far, that has been the greatest ending to a oversimplified video I’ve seen so far
Why I feel like some guy with Xenophobia will get inspired by this video someday?
We’re still feeling the blunder that was mapping the lake of the woods, search the Northwest Angle, MN. Basically a part of the US cut off from the rest of Minnesota, they tried to join Canada in the late 1990’s over walleye fishing laws.
One of my favorite videos now.
HE HAS COME BACK
I don't really care about your next video, but one interesting idea would be the Paraguayan War, aka the War of the Triple Alliance. I want to see something for South America!
LETS TAKE CANADA
0:55 I like how napoleon is awfully short
Love ur vidsss
this video was the best, nothing was bad, EVERYONE WAS SO GREAT 100/10
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HE IS BACKKKKKKK :)))))))))
I gotta be honest probably the best video I've seen just chaotic evil throughout and I'm all for it it's hilarious  Like what the hell is 33:24 its hilarious
the quality of all your videos always amazes me
Dang, I really missed NordVPN
Are you gonna post more Oversimplified??
this fire
It was just yesterday I thought to myself, "you know it's been a while since OverSimplified posted."   Oh happy day! Well, to hell with going to bed, I can spare 40 minutes.
I've watched the end canada manifest destiny part three times so far, slowly I'm being convinced of something the person arguing for it doesn't believe in
This is very similar to the Toledo War, Michigan and Ohio got pissed at eachother, not over a pig, but only one pig was killed
Nice
Wow. I knew about the Pig War but I always assumed it was sort of just a silly historical anecdote to laugh at. I never realized there was so much going on with it.  And yes, we should invade Canada.
The return of the king
for someone who loves star wars and oversimplifiedvideos at the same time, i like this video!
37:12 and on is the most patriotic thing I’ve seen on YouTube
Wait a minute.... the pig looks awfully familiar.... is that a gravity falls reference
That ending 🤣
I went to fire a gun off at the end but I thought better of it
Come Americans, I'm down to throw hands
Oversimplification is backkkk yayayayaayayyaya
Great video my dude awesome bit at the end as well
You finally remembered you have a youtube channel
finally haha
The only interesting thing in my washington state history class
I was just checking yesterday to see when the last video was!
Unsubed. Humor is too edgy for me now.
I eat my milk and drank my cookies
When the world needed his videos the most, he gave us this amazing video
Yayayya
I a Canadian am genuinely terrified
That...took a turn at the end!
Finally, after almost 7 months of waiting, oversimplified uploaded again.
what a ending. lol
YES YES IVE  BEEN WAITING FOR THIS WOOOOOOOOOOO
He needs too do Vietnam war but man it’s really nice to see him upload again
Then 1812 repeats itself
This is sus?
Looking back on his previous videos, it's interesting to see how his video style has changed over the years. As time went on, Oversimplified's humor really evolved.
Literally the best oversimped ending ever
ah….god bless america.
babe wake up oversimplified uploaded
This channel has a clear racial bias. Gross. Unsubscribed
You have no idea how happy that ending made me as a Canadian
Bro you good?
Ngl Pickett looks like an army version of Ian McCollum
YEEEEESSSSSS NEW VIDEO
YES!
Ancient Rome next please!
Sounds like somebody has watched America: the Motion Picture recently
That outro though
lets go finally another one; best channel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was the best way to enter a sponsorship
i watched the stream
I swear americas history is just the story of “that Nigga” at the party. Ya know the one that didn’t need to make a huge problem out of like a spilled drink and then freaks out saying “it’s their house now cause destiny!” Fucking a man .
finallyyyyyyy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Smiling after I saw your notification 😊😊😊
Every time i think "man, i haven't heard from OverSimplified in a while", he drops a banger
33:20 My favorite part of the video
Me and my friends made an over simplified club at school
The mist epic ending in oversimpilfied history
Where is the "dude...uncool"😯
Me: an Englishman living in Canada   Uh oh… I think I’ve overstayed my welcome in North America.
this is legit one of the best content of youtube...
😅😅😅 the end😅😅 the end 😅😅the end 😅😅
Nothing makes me feel more patriotic then watching history about McDonald’s in the 19th century
You totally did that bit at end exclusively for that last line lmaooooo
Oversimplified On every vid: I’m sure this won’t cause anyone to DIE *war starts*  Death rates: 100 Billion soldiers and the other side 19293929864876322466723346673728646674847846 Super trillion soldiers  Oversimplified on this vid: I’m sure this won’t cause anyone to DIE  Deaths: Americans 0 and British 0 and the pig 1  Me: hmm that’s a lot lower than the other vids
Silent upload! Never saw it!
Bro the begging and end were the best especially the part where it says "I didn't say they were WHITE people"
Bruh the ending though. HAHAHAHAHAHA
The return of the king❤️🔥
Wow lol
HE’S BAAAACK
This is the first time when oversimplified has posted since I subscribed You can imagine how fckin excited I'm
this was one of the best videos ive ever seen
Ngl, I would rather choke myself on maple syrup than become American.
What about the cake war of Mexico and france? Jaja les ganamos con nopales, eso si que es mexicano
first 500k ezzzzz
37:18 WE RIDE AT DAWN. CANADA WILL BE OURS
Another awesome video!
Add one more thing to my list of the impossible: a war was started over a pig. A bloody PIG.
where ya been ma boy );
Damn that escalated so quickly
noice
YES SIR AN UPLOAD
Dude I need a pin of spuddy
ha ha, im in danger
7:59 And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming, And they don't stop coming!
0:46 Why does it matter that they aren't white people? It's not like the British wouldn't conquer the French (who are also white) if they were given the opportunity.
37:09 as a canadian, i am fearful for this day to come 😂😂
Lets goo oversimplified posted
I love the last part lol
Best Video Yet
Does anyone know if Oversimplified is going to do a face reveal anytime soon (if at all)?
What a waste of time. Thought it was gonna be Vietnam war
this was freakin amazing
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO!!!!!!!
Right on my birthday, thank you
straight line straight line
Can you do the industrial revolution next?
Fun fact: Two Tiny islands are disputed by Americans and American-Supported Argentinians.  But one, didn't start a war, and one started a war.
Actually, I can’t really think of a single reason to not invade Canada, other than world domination is a bad idea.
“MAPLE SYRUP, THE AMAZING AMERICAN *FOOD* “  this is absolutely perfect
Hey OverSimplified do you believe in Northern USA or Southern Canada
They’re BACK!
Another one added to the rewatch repertoire!
Omg finally another won thank you so much
3 hrs. 440,000. Epic.
It would be nice if you make Philippine-American War Oversimplified:)
help im canadian
Please do one on yugoslavia!!
Yesss a new oversimplified video
finally
Hes back!  He’s bold! And hes Better than EVAAAA!!!!  Nah fr! Welcome back man! We were starting to miss you already! But we all knew you would come up with something good! And good you did! Love your videos! :D
Tiktok community career < This one video
He’s back guys
It's about time oversimplified  I was getting bored rewatching your other videos 5 times a day
That "i didnt say they were white" hit different.
no way
Every time I think "man it's been a while since Oversimplified posted something." He doesn't disappoint
Legend say people are still looking at goege moles
I live in BC and have never heard this story before so I am getting a real kick, etc.
Nee upload new upload new upload yeahh boioi
You guys should do the purchase of Alaska aka “Sewards falley” (not sure on spelling there) and the Yukon gold rush next!
Watches the end. Take that Canadians and shut your damn pie holes. Also that syrup you got up there keep the heavens nectar flowing. Also for the love of God ship them damn good Cadbury down here or else.
Could have prevented the Civil War?
He’s back
The ending was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -Charles Griffin
Ah its a good day
I had to Google this and it turns out it's part of Washington state. I was born and raised here and didn't even know that
Great video 👍
Oh boy
32:45 is one of the best moments in any Oversimplified video. Heck, this whole video is one of the best videos made
Masterpiece
The Ending is The Best
They finally made another video
I LOVE YOU
Have been waiting for a new vid for so long
You know.... I’m actually a fan of the red white and blue Mounties..
Heey, most boring state getting some love
noice
The last part was beautiful
Oversimplified went full shiczo on this one
He never fails
I’d love a siege of Constantinople over simplified!
“Whoa, I didn’t say they were white people.” Me: WHOAAA Ale Capone: WHOAAAAAAA
Funny thing I was actually born next to the islands like to the right it's funny because this happened a pig triggered this and I just realized that it's funny my dad told me a pig triggered it the war
I waited 6 months... just for a pig..     *Worth it*
OMG Christmas is early
Well looks like The Canadian-United Union is gonna be a thing.Also we took Vimy Ridge,Try us USA.
Yass finally
You don’t know how excited I was to see a new oversimplified video
bro just threatened half his fanbase
So...You doing vietnam next right???
Still as hilarious as ever. That last minute lol! Drake for President!
7:57 I see what you did there
What happend
Every new video. It gets better
He’s back!
Something great is coming when oversimplified is silent for 6 months
Oh look its The USA... Uh doing stuff and manifesting destiny.
Make a Philippines episode if you can
I manifested this
This has to he the funniest video I have ever seen!!!
His voices are so good
9:16 well that's new
Holy hell the outro lmao
Definitely the best humor in any Oversimplified video. Fantastic ending, had me rolling the entire way through
It truly happened a long time ago in a place far far away.
428k VIEWERS plus 28k like. No dislike yet😇😇😇😇
See you guys in mid 2022
The greatest American president drake
That poor pig... Remember in our hearts, Porky, 'the pig who had potatoes for lunch and a bullet for dessert".
Be careful what you wish, America annexing Canada, China invading Alaska. We all know where this is going.  War, war never changes.
8:19 he has no pants, and read the book
The only thing incorrect about the last segment of the video is that Drake won't be president. It will be... JEB BUSH.
Why the pig war why not the whole intier viking age
NEW VIDEO!!!
He’s alive!
Man..   was just waiting for a new video
As a Canadian, come and take it 🥱🇨🇦💪
You should do the Chinese culture revolution
that ending scared me
Attention to detail is very important
Heeesss back-letttssss goooo
Omg he uploaded
Canadian here WE BURNED THE WHITE HOUSE DOWN not the brits :)   not really canada didn't exist at the time but we still like to take the credit  just in case you try to invade us, you'll know what will happen to you ;)
🤣🤣🤣
Who thought that this was about the boar war
1:52 Me: what about a str- America: straight line? British: straight line. Me: but I said it first.
Ah yes, Canada acting like a wimp and getting screwed. As is tradition.
Your amazing history teacher you know it
37:16 The amount of passion and patriotism in his voice makes me think he seriously has devised a plan to make Canada the 51st state. We have the power of burgers and eagles! Barbecue sauce beats maple syrup!
Ive been waiting for your videos man why almost 6 months??
Me watching the ending like  GOD BLESS AMERICA
Petition to take over Canada, throw the continent into chaos,and possibly get the whole government impeached say I
The funniest thing, to me, about the ending is that for some reason, I just sorta assumed he wasn't even American.
I'm canadian, and I laughed my butt off during the final rant, good job oversimplified!
That escalated quickly
This was an especially awesome video, in terms of more obscure wars that can be covered, how about the taiping rebellion, where it features a Chinese Christian cult lead by a self proclaimed brother of Jesus and American mercenary Ward.
The animations just keep getting better and better!
Yo he is alive?
Who did the pig belong to? 🤣😂
Nice! New vid
The king has returned
Watch your back Canada. One day, we won't need a passport to drive to Alaska. We will manifest our destiny. A destiny to shoot all the polar bears, to sell out Tim Horton's to Baskin-Robbins, and to claim that the Vikings discovered THE UNITED STATES first!!!
YES YES YES
Conquer Canada, I agree
What a masterpiece. Worth the wait
LETS GOOOOO OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOAD
Disrespectful! ALL Americans know BORGHER King (fIVE GUys and  Steak n ShAKE)  is BEST! XD
Oh god that ending
But oversimplified um that costly the covid  issue makes it harder and where friends with Canada Biden still is dealing with a new veent also go to Washington dc and ask you mite get the answer also why do you think China don't invalid Russia or tiewan or USA invalid Mexico hmmmm mmm idk
i like the part were they talked adout curves
Oversimplified is the definition of Quality over Quantity
The most ridiculous and entertaining Oversimplified video yet!
This may be his funniest video yet.
I'd enjoy watching some Oversimplified Shorts based off of Sun Tzu's Art of War.
The ending makes me want to invade Canada      I am from Canada
That ending tho
As someone who lives on Vancouver Island I can confirm we are still very salty about this old dispute.
Well, now I have to ready the snow cannons. Also, you forgot to talk about Canada.
oversimplified kinda lost it here
27:26 lol
The greatest outro of this Chanel’s history
The natives did more to decimate one another's populations(as well as through famines and disease) than the white man ever did prior to their arrival, as awful as plenty of what they did do in many cases was.  Many tribes were brutal, even moreso than the newly minted Americans to one another and the health of the populations had been in decline for centuries. The "90% of native americans!" is not only hard conjecture due to lack of full records but also because their number had dropped significantly before the fact. Trust me, plenty of tribes were manifesting THEIR destinies all over other tribes for ages, hahaha
Bruh. Really hope you don’t hate Canadians
Let’s just love he made us own USA anthem at the end
Well, it was called the COP25 + Canada and the G19 + Canada because even smaller nations meme on American’s hat, whose 4 biggest cities are protected by the US navy. Being led by a hated lesbian doesn’t help.
Anyone else get the sudden and inexplicable urge to go all pre-ouched Benedict Arnold and invade Quebec? Also, for those of even higher culture, I hear there’s good fishing in Quebec.
I'm glad that you back :D
Pog
Hell yeah!
YES I GET HOME AN I SEE THIS   SCORE BB
min 37:08 but unironically
Thought I had my Christmas wishlist set.  This made me realize everything else is trivial.  Thank you, Oversimplified, for this beautiful present.
That escalated a lot there at the end! 😂😂
We should check in with oversimplified more often…
Babe wake up oversimplified posted
As an Canadian I hope that American invaded so I can see some real action and start a rebellion against the Canadian government
YES
Petition to invade Canada
Now the Mexican American war is a must do. Love the video man thank you for your hard work.
Oversimplified's descendance into madness begins here
You know what would be good? 100 years war let’s go
Yeah f canada!
The legend has returned
Clear-cut self-defense.
As a canadian, my response to the ending of the video is       try us, yank ;)
"Just as God Intended"
dang oversimplified has changed a bit
If only the beavers used  Nord VPN maybe then they could see as Paul onion said it quote the British are coming
oversimplified's descendance into madness begins here
Seeing that ending, I take it you found out you were related to Harney?
Oversimplification at its peak.
u fr need to talk about canada more we contributed a suprising amount in a number of wars
WE'RE TAKING CANADA BOYS 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Didn't talk enough about Canada. Skipped over the war of 1812 (which, y'know, Canada whooped ass in). Such a disappointment.
omg
Just like this comment so oversimplified can see it.
For something that is important for both Canadian and American history. I’m sure many on both sides of the border will not have heard of this. I knew. And that’s thanks to the “Cool Canadian History” podcast.      One day I hope I can Segway an add as good as this dude can.
I love this dude probably my favorite YouTuber I love the ending I laughed so stinking hard
How do you make a 30 minute video on topic that's usually covered in 2 minutes... AND MAKE IT SO GOSH DANG ENTERTAINING?!
Bro 31:27 has me 💀
I love how he just did something different and nailed it
Woah the voice acting improved dramatically in this video! Well done!
Waiting for it!!!!!
As an American both sides were in the wrong clearly the islands belong to the Sheep and their Pig King/Queen!
That speech at the end had me standing up ready to go to war. But the only thing Biden is coming to is a school to sniff hair
Wow! Great Video! I wonder what would happen if Americans invaded Canada. BTW Canadians do have an army of around 23,000.
This video is art. And I learned some shit
:47 I laugh way to damn hard here
29:17 buchanan!😂
Sir you’re a genius
Best. Ending. Ever.
why do they have b2?
3:40 & Nazis
How come there hasn’t been a video in so long?
This was mind blowing
i love how much more you have gotten used to speaking, now you give us these amazing videos
Thanks to Nord VPN.
The ending was hilarious lol
as a Canadian, I don't know whether to laugh or vomit with that ending
Everyone: Vietnam War!  Oversimplified: The Pig War  Everyone: We'll take it
HOLD UP, did Oversimpified just All Star Rolled us and create a new kind of Roll other than Rick? 7:57
me whos's a Washingtonian who knows that we have the islands and therefor knows how it ends
YOUR BAAAAAACK YEEEEES
2 hours no way omg omg oOoOH NoOO
omfg.... my maiden name... is Lyman..... fml
*civil war comes in* *stone wall Jackson intensifies *
HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
if Drake becomes president, I NOMINATE DJ AKADEMIKS TO BE FIRST LADY!
Love You man, You are great!
The ending was genuinely one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen, that being said don’t underestimate the Canadians, ask the Germans (I think they still have PTSD.)
I am scared
US first invades,then conquers Canada just to rename it to east Alaska.
Best video on YT by FAR
Yoooooo
Me: buys oversimplified plushy My Friends: why do you have a noiseless snowman
When we needed him most he returned
Don’t ask…  A woman: Her age A man: His salary Oversimplified: His upload schedule
YES 1812 part two, please!
37:04 i love how it just started snowballing into straight GOD BLESS AMERICA Say, can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched, Were so gallantly, yeah streaming? And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and at the home of the brave!!!
i've binging oversimlified, so this is a welcomed video.
Day 302 of asking oversimplified to make a video on the vietnam war
Before you finish the video, are the islands British or American?
The ending scene was by far the most amazing thing iv ever seen in my entire life
As a British fan of Oversimplified, you might ask me if the wait was worth it.  And I say yes, yes it bloody was.
I missed the premier by 2 min NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not now babe, new oversimplified dropped
I commented wow thats rare
New  vid!!!!!!!?!???!?!?!?
Heeeeeey
The legend has returned!
Our god has spoken fellas
Looks like Christmas came early.
the legend is back babyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
So basically, the Americans used their second amendment rights to go around and bully people...         BOY NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED!!!
omg, I've been waitin' for a half of year, man
WOOHOO
Ive been waiting for you to do this one
I have been waiting for this for a long time
Oversimplified dementia??????
epic.
Lyman: shoots pig Griffin: *SO YOU HAVE CHOSEN DEATH*
@Oversimplified reply to dis
Man OverSimplified is KILLING IT with these videos! No dislikes!
Oversimplified come at us Americans bro
Another, Hilarious And Entertaining Video ! Keep the Hilarious Historic Content Coming !
God damn great explanation!!!!!!
We’re using this channel for our kids’ history class. No lie. So good!!!
Yep, Over Simplified had officially lost his mind.
That transition to the ad lmao.
I'd totally attend a history class from this guy
I just realized, all that is currently happening (Coronavirus) means that oversimplified will have to make a video about this sometime in the future.
The end was worth the time investment
All I want right now is a dream smp war in oversimplified
It’s been 70 years…a new video
“Alright you psychopath,I’ve been waiting years for this!I HATE YOU!I ALWAYS HATED YOU”
Not a big fan of the end, eh?
"I hear voices all the time' 💀💀
Hey, uh... Oversimplified? Buddy? You uh.... you feelin' OK? Is the pandemic finally getting to you? The ending of that video that was.... that was something lol
Not that America is much better, but since Canada has gone all fascist police state, most of the Canadians I know would be more than happy to hail the stars and stripes.
Man, I was so desperate to look at george's mole. but oversimplified cutted it.
Let's go yahoo
please do the rule of british raj and the east india company next...your content has helped me with my history classes so much and i m really happy that someone is out there who makes history fun for everyone...love your videos and channel
Oversimplified, if you aren't kidding about the end of the video... you, are, insane
I think Mable pines is a direct decendant of Griffin
30 minutes has never felt so short in my life
If the US does invade Canada, what name would our new country be?
I just want to point out that the clothing of the indigenous people at 4:42 is actually a really nice attention to detail. Those stripes, in that order, is actually synonymous up here in Canada with the Hudson Bay Company, which is a department store now. They sell those stripes on a bunch of their products.
Funny how the Americans forgot that they’d ALREADY asked the Canadians to join them…and then been flat out rejected, and then flat out DEFEATED by them.
oh boy nothing like Watching OverSimplified with the boys
You can't just drop some Smashmouth "All Star" lyrics in the middle of the video and expect me not to sing the entire song in my head 🤣
Chill bro it's just syrup 🤣
31:48 WHY DID OVERSIMPLIFIED MAKE SOMEONE WALK?
“I would be worrying more about your own curves Benjamin” DAMNNNN
2 hours late come on
Where's that 'Nam special??
The pig wouldn't have been shot if he had used NordVPN
In 2 hours already 81k likes
Yay! He's back!!
When the world needed him, he came back
finnally a new vid
can you talk about the mexican american war?
The quality has increased so much
Heyyyyy Davy how you doing  Michael de Santa 2013
Genius
HE'S BACK LETS GOOOOO
Fantastic Video, as always. Oversimplified, you, whoever you may be, are my lord, my Jesus H. Christ, my savior. All Hail... ALL HAIL!
The king has returned
@oversimplify please make a Nordic/Scandinavian viking oversimplified series I am Swedish and you are my favorite history YouTuber and I would love to see a Scandinavian video love you
Great video as always :)
We already beat you guys the last time you tried.
I love you
that end part was a little too detailed to be on oversimplified
I remember going to Fort Vancouver when I was in 5th grade. It was pretty cool to see
Biden’s coming back with a vengeance
yeayy finally!
7:57 all star reference
Was just about to go to bed but oversimplified uploaded so 😤😤
Never stop making videos
All Star? In an Oversimplified video? This deserves a Dislike for sure.  D'OH NOOOOOO!
YOOOOOOOO NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO
You should do Vietnam oversimplified.
This was amazing
Basically a summary of Washington state history class
Is it just me or when I learn something in history class and I don’t get it this man makes me understand wayyyyyy better
Heyyy!!! You posted
why is no one talking about the all star reference at 7:57
@Oversimplified  Hopefully on your next video you go over the Mexican American War because it will be funny and will show (if people don't understand how we got Texas, California, and etc...) some battles and other things
Still waiting for the Vietnam here smh smh
That ending
Finally a new episode!
0:48 I new where this was going as soon as he said this.
Canadians, don’t be scared of Biden. Lmao he’s not one to fear.
I look forward to these videos more than anything else on YouTube!
3:33 Why is Florida there?
Omgg finally so excited to watch!!!
ABOUT TIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Underated topic: Apartheid government in South Africa or even civil rights movement in general
I’m so happy!
BEST OverSimplified ENDING EVER!!!!!
Petition for Oversimplified to make the Vietnam War video
War of 1812, please?
I’m shocked your hitler video got sponsored
Oh my god he has uploaded
I thought Oversimplified drawing a pig and a potato in a ballroom dress was the height of questioning one man's sanity, that is until I saw the end.
Thought I died
war we going to war great vid man
Hey oversimplified, can you make a video about the history of the Roman empire??. Just wondering.
Yes who else is happy he is posting
that last part tho. that kinda freaked me out.
Three things: 1) When will we get the Vietnam War Oversimplified? 2) We all know that the Canadians won the War of 1812 3) When will we get the War of 1812 Oversimplified?
Remember this war happened over a pig and a bunch of potatoes.
Aahh, my history fix.  I was relapsing.
YAY!!! AFTER 5 MONTHS OF WAITING A NEW VIDEO
1:20 m
Ooh eh if you want our land take it. That is what Canadian hospitality is all about eh?
Let’s takeover Canada
Whenever you upload video it makes my day good
38 minute video over only one dead pig? Wow!
"It was Sharon's cat right?"
EPICish
Come manifest Destiny and you end up just like Napoleon when he tried invading Russia. Turning back because its crazy cold XD
ALL HAIL OUR GLORIOUS PRESIDENT, DRAKE!!!!!! 🇺🇸💥🎤
HE POSTED LET'S GO!!!!
Canada needs some FREEDOM
If I was Canadian I think I’d be scared shitless  I mean, I’m American, and I’m scared shitless regardless
WATCH OUT CANADA
Us Canadians sitting on the worlds largest fresh water supply with a small military, its only a matter of time till we get invaded, id rather it be the USA
Keep up the great work man. Legendary vid
damn, a lot of experimentation in this video. I love the scott, harney, picket, hunt bit "Alright you psychopath! I've been waiting YEARS for this!"
The king came back
Oversimplified your back 😀
Oversimplified, nutshelling history to for us to understand much easier since 2016
At first you had my curiosity, now you have my attention
canada's cold. no thanks
Still waiting oversimplified Vietnam War for over 2 years now…
Vietnam war plz
my internet was out D:
YOO- I can’ t believe I missed the premiere but this was cool as heck
21:15 “can i get a hug” 💀💀
I always love when oversimplified makes a video. They are always getting better each day
The legend is back.
The ending tho
Easily one of your best, but I say that about them all. The ending though I laughed so damn hard.
Everytime  I see oversimplified I know its gonna be such a good video, love the work keep it up cant wait already for the next one
I come so early that no proper captions have been done yet
FINALLY OMYFUKINGOD
Babe wake up Oversimplified uploaded.
Hahahahahahahahahaha the ending was BEYOND EPIC!!!! Job well done 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
HE DID IT. HE UPLOADED. YAY
Canada 51st state yea......🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
If a pig can almost provoke an international conflict, then Oversimplified threatening war against Canada on the behalf of the US scares me.
Wtf how random is it that they let germany decide who gets the island xD
Did I enjoy this? Yes. Did I die inside when I heard that pronunciation of Fraser? Also yes.   In all seriousness though thanks for doing this one. Genuinely one of my favorites so far
Let's go new vid
Can you please do the mexican revolution is just chaos
We need to go invade Canada right now I mean come on it's the only thing left if not I'm just moving there cuz I I really want to go there and actually lives there because I want to learn where I know my kids will go through school without worrying about them being in a school shooting every single day and going to the bathrooms that look like Chernobyl but 5 times worth
This is a masterful telling of Canada-US border relations. I loved the portrayal of James Buchanan as cowardly and indecisive as that aided in part to the Confederate seceding.
Got a bit too real with that ending.
The siege of Canada begins
Go USA go USA POG
What is the music at 34:20?
omg the end
technoblade
But how many potatoes died to that pig?
This Episode Might have been the funniest episode yet. I Laughed aloud every 5 mins!!!'
"God bless America" drunk(formerly, kinda) man with a banana
27:26 but if you close your eyes.
The humor has honestly improved so much in this one. The sheep thing at 12:58 was the biggest laugh I got from these videos
I HATE AMERICA I HATE AMERICA YOU FOLKS HAVE NO FREE HEALTHCARE AND NO TIM HORTONS :trollge: the biden adminstration is outside of my house
What I’ve learned from history is that when ever I what something, just say it’s mine till the other person gives up
The thumbnail is just a masterpiece
Harney sent Picket to occupy the island This angered Winfield Scott who punished him severely
Scrolling YouTube  Sees oversimplified posts 2 hours ago  me: YESSSSSSSS
Not-so-fun fact: the westward expansion against Indigenous people mentioned at the beginning of the video was a massive inspiration for the German concept of “Lebensraum” and the Nazis’ desire to colonize eastern Europe (as well as murder millions of Jews and other ‘non-Aryans’).
Yooooooo
no pls
Manifest Destiny an excuse for imperialism? >chad yes face
7 months waiting for new Oversimplified... Worth it.
No he is not
Our lord and savior Oversimplified is Back
382,600th view lol
After long time in nutshell, honey keeps sponsoring this mtfk simplied joking history channel, make me laugh at terrible history 🤣🤣
I live on the Columbia river, and this was VERY entertaining 😂
The women war
when the world needed him most, he came back
“all dreams have meaning”  my dreams: 4:12
3:34 Florida placed weirdly 😳😳😳
22:19... did that letter cross the yet to be created Panama Canal?
i do not approve of this innocent swines killing
I’ve been waiting
Someday I think you need to do a video on the “Whiskey” War between Canada and Denmark. Might be a little small, but I think it would be fun to look at.
Dang and I thought we all had a right to touch each other’s grass
OMG Vancouver Washington was on the vídeo *_*
This man might start a war
He is back!
At the end of the video, I have a feeling that Oversimplified wanted this video to be sponsored by either Europa Universalis 4 or Hearts of Iron 4, but the HOI4 or EU4 team denied his sponsor request so he improvised.
i just noticed in the video that the guy that shot the pig racked a break-action double barrel shotgun like a pump shotgun
Let’s make a stupid Parody Musical comedy out of this!
War with Canada?  Not until President Biden's next colonoscopy.
Did he.... fiinally went crazy?
The all-star reference made my brain get smart and my head get dumb
A war over a pig? They got triggered for the simplest things began then.
I love this channel so much
I think a Julius Caesar oversimplified could be cool
he has to hit us with the nord vin :(
why did i think the pig sounded like morgan freeman 💀
I was hyped when did dropped out
I had the will to watch this video witch is saying something
Can I just comment on how fucking fantastic your voice delivery has gotten, it was already great before but holy cow it's not just your editing but your delivery has gotten even better too and I love it LOL
This video was made possible but it won't failure tomorrow -text to apeech
mmm a new upload, delicious
Use me as dislike if you dislike this for some reason
What march is it when the Americans find out about the gold at 16:30?
Over simplified: who won the San Juan Islands? Me, who lives on San Juan Island: omg do tell
LETS GO HES BACK
hey what about korea?
19:50 “he’s so mean!” 😭😭
Lmfao “our glorious president…. DRAKE”
This day is epic now
Me still waiting for nam war
I thought this channel was Canadian
THE PIG WAR
yeahhhhh new post
Lol this got me laughing at the end I live in eastern USA and my cousins live in Canada both beautiful country’s but also we both argued about the 1812 incident war that was both draw. My cousin says USA lose the war of 1812 which I didn’t agreed. But when I saw this vid I was laughing hard that USA own the small land and USA beat Canada without war and bloodshed. It was the Germans put the rights to own the land of the islands lol. If USA took Canada if the prime minister surrendered Canada without war and bloodshed? My cousin will be mad if Canada went to a state of USA lolXD. Still we should leave Canada alone ira a beautiful country and our brother from the father of the British.
4:11 is the best point lol
Someones about to get spanked!
Took u a few months but u did it
He made a 40 minute video just to get back at his canadian fans omg...
Bro I just spent an hour binge watching your channel and now you decided to upload. What’re the odds. Thank you.
I don't know if I, as an American, should be more disappointed that I'd never heard of this debacle in our history before, or if I should be disappointed we didn't go to war with pigs, like Australia and the emus.
As a Canadian I’d hate to be occupied by America, but Oversimplified made it sound good
Oh hell yeah!!!!
Finally
Finally the new video, I was excited for a long time.
I feel like this is the last upload we will get for 2021 but I'm hype to see it.
American Mountie-
sheesh
I absolutely love this channel, every couple months I rewatch all the episodes and I can’t wait for new ones, this episode I actually knew nothing about so it was neat to learn something completely new. Please don’t ever stop making these you do such a great job 👏🏻
10:36 is an accurate display of farcical shenanigans that take place in the Houses of Parliament.
27:25 he took the time just to change the tiny little island's color
1:21 Dude! Uncool.
the northern ireland men love me at 9:20 took me out
Huh hes back
THE LEGEND FINALLY POSTS
THAT ENDING!!! The mockery, the insults, the self-burns, the appreciation of Canadian friendliness and hospitality, the self depreciation of American ignorance; I laughed so hard I literally cried! BEST. VIDEO. EVER!!!
Breaking News: The USA has started an invasion of Canada, using their nuclear arsenal, and their mass amounts of manpower, partly because of a Youtuber named "OverSimplified." We have seen pictures of mountains and hills in colors red white and blue, with jets ripping the skies with starts and stripes, Wayne Gretsky waving American flags while saying "U-S-eh?",  Maple Syrup Companies embargoing Canada, ruining their food supply, and Drake trying to run for president. If you see any of this happening, please call 9-1-1, eh?
This is how you combine entertainment and education! Love this channel! 🇬🇧
This has to go down as one of the funnist OverSimplifed Vidoes ever 100% at least a top 5.
408,104
A very early Christmas gift 🎄❤️
that ending was absolutely priceless
i don't think i was prepared for how that video ended. im truly beside myself rn. bravo
Why does spuddy have sonic the hedgehog shoes
Pig looks like gravity falls
the anti-whiteness on this one was a little much. I'm only 3:45 in. Like, bro, you're white. We're white. Stop.
YESSS OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED
Man, I definetly wasn't waiting for that ending
30:41 Level 1 pig noob 31:38 level 500 pig mafia boss
16:00 did an american character just use a russian gun?
I just want to know how Canadians feel about this. Please leave your response here
Yo, don’t over simp for people
What the f was that ending jajajaj
The last part about invading Canada 🇨🇦 was very convincing! 🤣🤣😅😅
I got an oversimplified upload on my birthday which was today (or at the time that I’m posting this)
YOOOOOOO
I watched the end in a discord call with a bunch of Americans and two Canadians. When the end happened, every American was screaming cheers of patriotism at the site of such beauty, while the two Canadians were drowned out by the patriotic cheers
FINALLY ANOTHER UPLOAD LES GOOOOO
Look like Christmas came  early
"The 'Frasier' Canyon Gold rush..."   I am so triggered by this.  /edit: okay, that ending triggered me even more.  American Maple Syrup?  Drake as President? Banff Rushmore?  TABERNAC!!!
The king returns!
He has returned
BABE WAKE UP NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED JUST DROPPED
Why did I not get the notification for this?  Dude......uncool.
The B2 bombers got me cracking... 13:46 31:02 32:44 I really had to repeat that one...
4:13-WHERE’D THOSE B-2s COME FROM??
So happy my home region is getting some representation on Oversimplified! A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
Holy shit that ending was great
Bruh!!! Drake for President after we take Canada!!!!!
That was the best video you've made. I was laughing the whole damn time
Me: "Wow Oversimplified, you've improved a lot on the quality of your videos. You're amazing!" Oversimplified: "Oh well, Thank you!" Me: "...say it BAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!"
That outro was absolutely perfect. 😂😂👌
Please do the Vietnam war next!
I love your videos ... The WW 2 and Russian revolution helped a lot in my studies thankyou . You are the best . I got 95/100. in History after ur Videos . U r awesome
Let’s go a new vid
He has returned
Can we get the vetinom war
Oversimplified uploads and I literally stop whatever I’m doing to watch. This time I was in the middle of a jump,….I’m still hovering.
Conclusion from this video : Lets invade Canada
is this safe to upload?! canada would be soo angry they could armed moose and then invade  usa!
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
AhahajahahahHaAAAaaaa
I thought the pig wars was about technoblade 😂
boi is bouta start a war with canada
Are you good Oversimplified? You seem to be ranting
My God.. this content.. it’s free
Welcome back it’s been a while
Again, Oversimplified never disappoints me. See you again in the next 6 months.
6 months
Best video ever
It’s……perfect
The ending out a tear in my eye
HES BACK
Oink
Yeay you come back
Call it North Minnesota
Yo the ending was funny as heck I couldn't stop laughing 😂🤣🤣
I actually heard that the British were stockpiling cotton because they knew in the 1850s America was looking unstable and when the South was blockaded they started looking for India and Egypt for cotton since there wasn't a Civil War going on.
These videos have always been hilarious. Keep up the good work man!
what the fu was that outro
Still a better love story that twilight
As a Canadian, the ending felt sort of threatening.
Oversimplified would be the greatest history teacher
そキルみやんろなるま^_^
Me a Canadian who lives in the San Juan islands
The ending was amazing, truly the best ending of all YouTube videos!
Yo watching this vid two hours after it’s been released feels kinda good, I’m one of the first people to watch this
Racist be like
Hey
Oversimplified posted?????? shieeeeeeetttt
Your extreme patriotism at the end made me laugh so hard I kinda want America to invade us
time to think of a funny comment
I love that the pig looks like waddles from gravity falls
Please don't invade Canada
Ah! A new Oversimplified? Christmas came early this year <3
Man that ending got me crying 💀 also could you make a video on the Texas Revolution
Per my agreement, from the 3 kingdoms vid (go find the comment) I'll update it, this goes AFTER Napoleon but before the Civil War, right in the middle of those two (also I made a mistake, the first part of the Russian revoloution can actually go before WW1, as that entire vid takes place BEFORE the ww1 videos)  So it's :  Three kingdoms Battle of hastings  The war of the bucket  Henry  American revoloution  French revoloution  Napoleon  Pig war  The civil war  Russian revoloution part 1  WW1  Russian revoloution part 2 Prohibition  Emu war Hitler WW2  Cold war  Football war  Falklands war  Again, I'll update this every new video he comes out with. also thank you for the replies in the last one of these I did! Didn't expect it to blow up this much
That ending XD
The end was epic until you reminded us that president Brandon exists
3:38  It's my DENSITY!"
Finally new upload.
0:53 is it me or is that waddles from Gravity falls in that dark robe because it looks like em
Father has given us fresh content
We Missed Oversimplified, but his content, Design, and Animations have gone better than ever
This has to be one of the best episodes of over simplified I've ever seen. It was hilarious.
FINALY
canada is the best
Yey!!! A new video your the best oversimplified
The ending kind of worries me……
I was friends with General Scotts great grand children, who are also generals!
As a 'Strayan I have ingrained magnetism towards any war that has an animal in its name haha.
93.86/10
That ending was WILD!!!
A day always feels better with a oversimplified vid
I'm Canadian, and I don't feel safe anymore from the US
Poggers
I feel like my church just got so many shots taken at it😂😂😂😂(church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint) (Mormon)
US invading Canada? Hmm, where have I heard that before...("I don't want to set the world on fire" starts playing in the background)
The history humor god is back i love this guy
Listen, we'll let you invade, but only on the condition that drake get's to be president.
"They're just Floating there, *_MENACINGLY_* "
Certified banger right here folks
Finally oh my god I though u died
33:29 The way he screamed tho! 🤣🤣🤣
He went psycho at the end
as a canadian i am now terrified
I love oversimplefied
Always will be early lord oversimplified
Man that got weird at the end. But this guy is still awesome.
Bro did Lyman just shotgun pump a muzzleloaded rifle?
ITS BEEN 6 MONTHS
After months, the legendhasreturnex
3:55 “I hear voices ALL the time 😀”
ok let me get this strate you think that Biden's gonna invade Canada during a Globla pandemic? ok
All this fight over land that actually belongs to the Native People.
2:50 happy Napoleon
Welcome back Oversimplified!
He definitely lost his damn mind and became unhinged at “cheap insulin.” You can tell in his voice…  And, damn it, I love it! Have my thumbs up
The end made every single canadian wet themselves.
I'm not in Canada and even I don't think that America will try to invade Canada for as long as I'm alive, when I'm dead though? eh probably will, I just hope there wouldn't be any casualties!
Can we double check this man’s sanity
That ending went from 0-100 real quick!
I wonder how these history figures would how they  represented on oversimplified.. I would love to see their faces lol
I loved the part about Biden!!
I agree.
the man the myth the legend is back
he legend has returned
Straight line?
Wow! He mentioned Canada!
Please MOOOOOORRRRRRREEEEEE videos kind sir
37:27 lmao
Oversimplified could be gone like 6 months and  come back with trending videos
One of this channel's best videos to date. Way to make an obscure topic interesting and hilarious.
You should make a video on the bour wars
Wth was that ending?! Lmaooo
banger as always.
I'd love to see Oversimplified tackle of the War of the Roses.
Wow part 37:08
Pickett was probably the biggest plot twist here
A STRAIGHT LINE
DAY OF THE RAKE OCCUPY CANADA NOW
Ya gonna need you to tone back the anti- American sentiment. And I don’t appreciate you considering Biden as president.
now i have to wait until May - June 2022 for the next video... (unless theres a part 2)
R.I.P Pig
God dammit he did it again
Best video yet
every thing in this video ....................................... is................... gosh..................................darn.................................awsome.................................... if you tube has a star rating i will give this 999999999999999999999........ well tha sir heheh
Piglen seeing wither skeleton‘s be like:
Oversimplified only puts out bangers
4:10 ahhhh…America <3 💕
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
ngl, I kinda would do the same in Buchanan's shoes.. like.. holy shit, for real.. poor guy.
I live in Canada and would welcome an invasion but Biden is more likely to March on Canada and end up in Mexico lol
It’s truly a holiday when Oversimplified uploads!
Comment to drive up engagement
6 Months and we got a masterpiece. Y E S
Another amazing video. You know, it would be a shame if you ran out of petty, insane conflicts to cover. Right boys? In no way should we ever continue to escalate situations with our neighbors on the worlds stage. Wink, wink *nudge* *nudge* . I think its time for some more straight lines!
Cool
Dude why did you get me all sad about a bloody pig?? 😭 RIP Porky🕊
Hooray I found this one early!!!!
I swear I called he would upload today
And I was worried that he was running out of ideas😀
"I didn't say they were white people"
I liked your 3 kingdoms video, so you could do a video about later Chinese history; probably starting around 1911. You could also give more details about the Russian civil war.
I haven’t laughed this hard in so long!! Thanks Oversimplified!
I didn't know technoblade was in history
that ending makes me think OverSimplified is going insane. his idea is.. well, Im sickened, but curious
Finally a new video
Yeah a new upload
Harney fired Captain Hunt and put Pickett back on the San Juan Islands. This angered Winfield, who punished him severely.
That "yee haw" made America proud.  8:48
I WANT THE AMARICAN DREAM IN CANDA
I can't believe YouTube didn't notify me that oversimplified posted
14:36 Lol
now vietnam plz
HE FINALLY UPLOADED AGAIN BOIS
I think a video covering all the presidents of the united states and what they did would be freaking dope :)
nice thumbnail
yeah im watching this when im supposed to be asleep  what about you guys
I love that you're just jumping off the deep end here
He’s back, he’s back that’s what all the people say being quiet in fall and right back today
The end is the most patriotic thing I have ever seen
13:29 This caught me so off guard
We will burn down your White House again and again and again.
38:20 USA! USA! USA!
As a Canadian, I can guarantee I won't be sleeping tonight after that ending
Anybody else hear Morgan Freeman at 31:06 ?
No one noticed 7:58-8:03
We need a vietnam oversimplified
This man loves America too much.
27:25 "Decide if America should look like this or this" can someone please make the "it almost looks like nothings changed at all" meme for it
Hi
Glad to see you back!
24:47 mistake lol u cut out "enough" rip
37:15 I laughed so hard at all this it almost gave me a heart attack
Bidens coming baby
As a Canadian- The final minute had me shaking in my boots lmao
YESSSSSSS
Canada more like AMERICA GUNS BLAZING YEAH
Thank you Sir
I dare America to come up here to Canada and try to beat us in the war because unlike America we’ve actually never lost a war. We also have the bravest soldiers in the world there has been many cases of Canadian soldiers being extremely outnumbered and still winning. So come on America give us your best shot🇨🇦 You may have more weapons America but you don’t have some thing that Canada has and that’s balls
I refuse to believe that the Prohibition Video was nearly a year ago.
Not gonna lie, the end is pretty damn hilarious 😂
Please do Margaret Thatcher/ The troubles Oversimplified or Ivan the Terrible Oversimplified.
My Christmas Gift came early
I love how the pig looks like Waddles from Gravity Falls
That was the single best ending to any piece of entertainment be it a film, book, TV show, or music,  nothing is as introspective or soul touching as the ending of that video. I cried when I finally saw Wayne Gretzky holding the American flag.
WOOOOOOOOOOO
LETS GO MORE OVERSIMPLIFIED
Taking the flag pole was a little bit petty
HELLLL YEAAAA LETS GET CANADA BOYSSS!!
I kinda hope one day Oversimplified does one super long video of all of world history: History, Oversimplified.
every oversimplified video I watch I DIE from laughter.
Ive learned more watching these videos than any history class i've ever taken
Simply beautiful.
The placement of Florida at 3:34 makes it look like the Continental United States is well-endowed. 😂  Such is life when your home state is its own meme and its own 🍆 joke.
oversimplified drops new video? Christmas has come early
Oversimplified giving us a mighty good Christmas present. Always delivering the best of the best
The ending on this was insane
Neat
He uploaded😩😩😩
I couldn’t help but agree at the end.  It’s my god given right to invade Canada.
3:37 density what?
You can see his excitement
Finally a vedio after 6 months
Can you get to India through North America? No. But at least there's beaver.
Biden’s coming baby
31:47
Oversimplified is ALL THE WAY BACK BABY! To Ontario or die!
That ending lol
Pls alex the gate bro pls
I always Watch your videos Oversimplified

Dude he killed the pig          Uncool
Meet us by the flagpole on san juan
Every Heard the term fuck around a find out??
I remembered learning about Polk's Oregon negotiations and General Pickett (from his Civil War service) in school, so it's nice to see those subjects popping up elsewhere.
Who wants a video about the afghan war
Is nobody going to talk about how Oversimplified casually made an epic historical remix of All Star at 7:58?
Did a YouTuber just threaten an entire country?   Poggers
holy shit, he’s back. calm down EVERYBODY CALM DOWN
The last two minutes were the most I’ve seen oversimplified descend into madness
Pooog
Probably should've failed Pickett
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed
Epic
Absolutely perfect
That's the best video on the internet xD
I lost 38 minutes of sleep to watch this. It was worth it.
such an American story
The Star Wars thumbnail shows how funny who it would be
Babe wake up, Oversimplified posted another video
Amazing ending
Join the american side  .....   WITH NORDVPN
As an American, I would rather Canada conquer us
Plz Make More Videos On Historic topics Like Sweden Independence
Cool new video
Late at night. Interview tomorrow. Watching Oversimplified Now.   Worth it.
Finally, after six long months the legend is back!
37:30 me being Canadian “oh noo”
Oversimplied poppin off at the ending tho
FINALLY BACK I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Oversimplified has officially gone insane
The ending is so based
OMG lol ont easily one  of the best videos yet, I watched it with my parents in Canada and laughed so hard my mom cried
WOO
I wish it was the russian revolution
Pause... 7:11
Yo it’s you again
I read about this in a state history book a while ago and I have been begging and waiting for this video
Hard to believe that it took until the late 19th century for England and the US to stop being enemies.
Vote oversimplified for president next election 37:18
THE LORD HAS RETURNED (holy pig nice  #1 trending)
A few days ago I started getting the itch for a new oversimplified
Me: catching my brother downloading games on my phone 33:29
Nice
That ending was spicy. Very good indeed, watch out Canadians. We are coming for you.
Cool plush but it’s just 2 snowballs with sticks lol
"Then why not snuggle... ME!" Same tbh
33:30 I don’t think l’ve laughed so much
So you're telling me that one episode of Hey Arnold is real?
Can we get videos on the rise and fall of Rome?
My gosh calm down Oversimplified at the end lmao
the pig is wodales from gravity falls
Can you make more?
I criticize my my own country more than anybody I know. However that ending…my Lord. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
I was just thinking I was missing an oversimplified video. Excellent job as always!!
That was a beautiful  ending
Funniest video yet!
Do the Texas revolution
BECAUSE BIDENS COMING BABYYY
Good to k ow the national characters started early, America with its nonsense and craziness, Canada with looking and being multicultural but hiding a lot of long standing discrimination problems under the radar.
Do the potato war by Technoblade
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo love this guy
Emus Now Pigs What’s Next Humans?! Oh Wait...
And so the wild oversimplified came out of hibernation in order to put out a new video. Unfortunately he only put one video and now we have to wait for the wild oversimplified to come back for another 6 months, but when he comes back it is truly a sight to witness.
War on terror next pls
Im gonna need a clip snippet of that last part to send to my canadian friends tho
Oversimplified quality content! Awesome!
“My certified lover boys” by far the greatest quote oversimplified had ever made
why is this video full of anti white expansion
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
War Mexican. América 1846_ 1848 8:37
Best ending I have ever seen
Hes back baby
37:10 - 38:20
Threatening to take over Canada oversimplified?  **Dude, uncool.**
fighting a war over rodent pelts...  yep, sounds about right.
Watching the evolution of Oversimplified   is just astonishing and amazing to see
He's back ladies and gentlemen He's back
Yes
WHERES VIETNAM
the 6 month wait was worth it
Fucking smashmouth reference and that amazing segway, your videos keep getting better and better.
38:19 "It was at this is the moment when oversimplified lost his marbles."
The man, the myth, the legend oversimplified is back after months of waiting. If he takes too long to post another video, send the emus after him.
YES
THIS JUST MADE MY DAY
Less gooo new vid
7:23 Truly British, what the- NOOOOO
The wait is always worth it for these videos. Top tier content
And also i think you have gone a little insane...just a bit...no problem
And when the world needed him most, he returned     Welcome back, Oversimplified
EVERYBODY GEAR UP. WE GOING TO WAR BABY. Woooohoooo
Holy shit a new video, Christmas present
When we needed him most, he came back
The potato war
Canadians think that last segment was a joke. Watch your back, eh?
Had a bad day today, thanks for making it better.
After 5 months of endless patient and waiting, we have yet again been given upon a video about history in the most comical ways one can imagine and I look forward to Biden's vengence.
the last part had me in smileing
Nice one
I swear to god my brain thought body pillow when he said something to cuddle
I pre-liked the video because at this point you just know.
Really liked the ending skit, well done!
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
Hi
I love that in the Oversimplified lore, Joe Biden is to become the next Napoleon figure and vastly expand American territory.
What was this stupid end😂😂
Oh Yeah I Love This Channel
37:18 why not a joint Mexican-Canadian invasion of the USA?
Can we get vietnam next?
Love the vids, you should do some medieval videos
Hi
I don't want to go to war with Canada, but Canadian oil drills are killing Guatemalan forests, so... Viva America!
A long time ago on a continent far far away                                       star wars theme plays
YAY!!

The goat
I floop the pig
Wow. Christmas came early
Lol Pickett must have liked to send his troops to exposed positions. He was doing it for years.
I hate you for trying to get the American s to invade Canada
Luved the ending, very interesting, it went from pig to destiny real quick
yeAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
America could invade and win Canada with the Deleware State Police alone, and a cat.
Glad to see you post content!
We want more and more videos
And my friends say history is boring well they're not entirely wrong but they certainly never had a teacher as great as Wikipedia and Oversimplified to teach them about a war fought over a slice of bacon with legs
Well, I *was* going to bed. Guess that'll wait!
Finally Oversimplified has uploaded a video! :D
President Drake? I'm going to move to Cana.... oh wait...
Oversimplified, can you do a video about Tamil history, as Tamil was the oldest language. There has been many Tamil rulers such as Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. Because Tamil history will be so interesting. தமிழ்
TIME TO CONQUER CANADA
I  cant believe i got soup rolled at 6:31
Day of the rake confirmed
Just a reminder, the Hatfield and McCoy feud started over ownership of two razorback hogs.  Multiple people died in that feud, including children.  *Pigs are serious business.*
The king has returned
1:32 me when I see a gotcha life fan
Oversimplified, can you do a video about Tamil history, as Tamil was the oldest language. There has been many Tamil rulers such as Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. Because Tamil history will be so interesting.

Oversimplified, can you do a video about Tamil history, as Tamil was the oldest language. There has been many Tamil rulers such as Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. Because Tamil history will be so interesting.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The fact they took the flag pole with them
Internet Historian, Vsauce, Oversimplified, Historia Civilis, these guys upload once, maybe twice a year if we're lucky. But damn if they aren't more than worth the wait. Today is a good day.
That last bit felt personal
The Whole Video Had me Laughing
You know you've won at life when you post a video about an obscure historical event and you have >370,000 views and >8,300 comments IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS.
His back
YOOOO A NEW UPLOAD AFTER N YEARS! <3
Please don’t give Brandon any ideas…
5:56 That's gotta be the most genuine "WTF??" I've ever heard on Oversimplified
31:05 is that a simpsons reference?
Oversimplified - Announcing the American takeover of Canada Mexico - Nervously builds defences
Here we go again, bois
Oversimplifed chart   pros- great editing, sound quality, facts, promotions, awesome videos all around  cons-                                             NONE!
Oversimplified has uploaded praise the lord
About not mentioning Canada, YOU NEVER MENTIONED CANADA DAY JULY 1ST 1867
BOUTTA TELL THE BOYS THAT OVERSIMPLIFIED RELEASED A NEW VID
Bruh
Ending 10/10
Libya, Egypt, and Sudan decide their borders "straight line" - "straight line"
He uploaded!!!!!
FINALLY
33:29 Pure unadulterated fear
That poor potato
19:11 Why do I hear doom music?

37:17 That is how you end a video in VICTORY.
Straight lines  The most simplest border ever 😃😅😂😂😂
Woo bts !
Please do either war of 1812 or Texas Revolution
THE LORD IS BACK!
A new video I was starving for more oversimplified
Welp I guess I’ll see you guys again in 6 months!
MANIFEST DESTINY!
Oh sure we let you keep some poxy islands. We did burn Washington DC to the ground.... :D
I gotta love the goddamn Americans
AHAHHH NEW UPLOAD AYY
I just had a test on this today bro
11:20 his scream🤣
After watching the end, are you okay, Mr. Oversimplified? Do you need to sit down for a bit?
Hmmm..... Straight Line? Straight Line.
Nice
Hitler's father wasn't used during the video. I'm a bit disappointed.
I loved the Manifest Density bit, had some sincere Back to the Future vibes :)
War of 1812 was definitely not a draw
This video was just oversimplified declaration of war to Canada
The legend returns
The legend have return
Biden comin baby and this time he's comin with a vengeance   Afghanistan: UNO Reverse Card
This is the greatest channel
Thank you for this video, Oversimplified! I never knew this particular story of history!
This actually seems like something that would happen in a Minecraft server
If Biden tried to invade Canada he’d accidentally invade Mexico
It was just yesterday I was telling myself a new video before Christmas and here we are. Anyway nice to see you guys before it hits the trending tab.
4:00 seems accurateXD
he's backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Before 1MilSimple Ticket
Loved every minute of it man  excites me  to see new content i can only imagine how long these videos take
Hay now this was an All-Star video!
37:25 this doesn’t even sound like Oversimplified
So you are saying that this is called the pig war but has nothing to do with technoblade
The chaotic Americans running around is the most accurate depiction of us I’ve ever seen.
YES FUCK YES
I suggest if the island not belong to Britain or the American I suggest the island belongs to the animal or independent
Wow! Oversimplified, I was really surprised to learn you're American! As a subscriber for 3 years, I'd noticed the way you pronounce certain words, and assumed you were Canadian. Boy is my face red!...white, and blue.
I have the sneaking suspicion OverSimplified wants to come to Canada.
The was amazing merica
Oversimplified Can you do some Indian history? Because India has been ruled by many kingdoms. Finally Britain ruled India for 300 years. It would be very interesting.
War is about to break out on San Juan so the Seattle locals ride up on boats to watch. That has got to be the most Washington thing I've ever heard. And I would know, I'm local to this region. Got a great view of the island from my apartment window.
This makes me sad... Not because of the video, it's great.  But im sad i have to wait another 6+ months for another simplified video
when the world needed him most... he came back
You had me at smash mouth
That ending...oh my... XD
I missed over simplified
2:37 Muricans: *@#$%*
Oversimplified Can you do some Indian history? Because India has been ruled by many kingdoms. Finally Britain ruled India for 300 years. It would be very interesting.
“I’m sure this conflict won’t cause anyone…TO DIE.”  I mean, it technically didn’t?
U should make a video on the invasion of sealand
He’s back baby
Vietnam when
This is one of the greatest oversimplified videos ever!  ‘You should use, NORVPN!’ ‘What the f?’
Canada's destiny is to be absorbed into the US, no invasion necessary.
dude, uncool.
Nailed it br9
There are 3 things that are certain in life   1. Alabama is really good at football 2. Japan will always have the best anime 3. Oversimplified will be sponsored by either Honey, NordVPN, or some war game
Those Islands belong to Britain 🇬🇧 I'm actually American btw.
this exists
You make my day every time I watch one of your vids.
Pls do the Philippine revolution next
Let’s go upload
Freaking star wars ripoff 🤬
Everytime i learn something new about america, it makes me dislike them a little more
Oversimplified Can you do some Indian history? Because India has been ruled by many kingdoms. Finally Britain ruled India for 300 years. It would be very interesting.
I always wondered why the US never invaded Canada.
That ending tho, best Oversimplified scene ever.
President Drizzy
THE KING HAS RETURNED
WHERES VIETNAM WAR OVERSIMPLIFIED
Uk "oh no canada  the USA is back trying to invade you." Canada "i got the lighters you get the gasoline and we will burn the white house down again." UK "THATS MY BOY!"
HE FINALLY UPLOADED I THOUGHT HE DIED
That was the best ending in the history of YouTube
Aight this is a petition to take over Canada. Ayoo Joe Byron how about you get us Canada?
Love it
I’m sorry but like I stated on the napoleon video I think your going to crazy with the weird humor
POGGGG
Why not do a video on Laura Secord
HES BACK
33:27 I WAS ROLLING HERE XDDD
Hearing another voice besides the one we always hear in these videos, even if it was only for a moment, was honestly very surprising. I was expecting pig to do something but when it sounded different I was like “Woah…is there gonna be a tax for that?”
Drake for president 2024🥳🥳🥳
Biden’s coming baby 😏
Watch out Canada 😂
Do the Anglo Zulu wars next
hes back
That ending though…….
Waddles as the pigs is funny
Hey I think you should turn down on the jokes s little.
An oversimplified video about my home state? what could be better!
The thumbnail says a lot
This just made my day these are the best history videos ever
Hell yeah let's invade Canada!!!! That was the point of the video right? It got confusing towards the end lol. Another amazing video
Definitely an A++ video. Just when i thought your content couldn't get any better, you've proven me wrong.
:D
3:33 lmaooo i know why he put the legs there 😏
im down to invade canada
The King has returned
I ❤️ manifest destiny
Canadia I shall invade in 13 years, after I conquer mongolia and surrounding territory my eyes shall move onto canadia
Finally a another video:)
YES! MANIFEST DESTINY THE FUCK OUT OF CANADA!!!!!
I've been to the San Juan Islands they're very nice...also am i the only one who is thinking of the hey Arnold episode also titled " The Pig War"?
16:01 should of used a m16a3
I’m scared
Love the “dude…uncool”
I want "Straight line? Straight line." On a T-Shirt PLEASE
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Tomorrow in the news I am going to see that a war with Canada was started over a video about pigs
i was here 2 hours after this was uploaded
FUCK YEAH ITS ABOUT TIME WE'VE BEEN BEHOLDEN TO THOSE MAPLE-SNIFFING MOOSE LOVERS FOR TOO LONG!
It takes half of a year for the videos but the content is extremely good so there is no reason to complain
hey Oversimplified! Can u make video about the Rome plssssss
The more oversimplified grows, the quicker he will upload
We missed you...
Starting:normal Ending:🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am from New Westminster, Canada and this made my day
Now that was one heck of an ending
The perfect thumbnail doesn't exi-
The video was great until the cocaine kicked in. Then it was even better.
I love to imagine this guy in a homemade sound booth aggressively yelling into his computer mic
Next do the nez perce war
thank you mr oversimplified
yooo
That ending 🤣🔥🔥
Erb and oversimplified posted only one I need to post is sam onella academy
It’s cool how they added Mexico and Texas when time passed
Wtf is this video, why the fuck is this video, most importantly HOW LONG HAS IT FUCKING BEEN
Let’s hope for Vietnam War comes next
YEAH CANADA YOU LISTENING? BIDENS COMIN BABAY
Funny how his mental health is deteriorating
Was literally just wondering when the goat would return
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
Finally you’re back
Oregon country? Nah, i prefer  CASCADIA.
been binge watching your videos for a while so i’m really happy that you just posted :oo
We did it boys, He finally had a Mental Breakdown
THE BOYS ARE BACK! THE BOYS ARE BACK!
he was fuherous 😳😳😳
I may have not seen the live video, but this one was great
Everytime Oversimplified uploads, it feels like Christmas
Do the Sengoku Jidai!
THE LEGAND IS BACK
bro wake up, oversimplified just uploaded again
Y'know what's hilarious There's a lot of personal family history on the San Juan Islands. Like, my ancestors built the first house on Orcas Island and our family still owns it.
this feels like a normal situation on hermitcraft
7:57 OVERSIMPLIFIED ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD WAS GONNA ROLL ME
A new Oversimplified video!!! Can’t wait to watch this
3:37 it's my density took me out oof
Straight line? Straight line. Made me crack up XD.
This is the best oversimplified video ever made not going to lie
YOOOO ANOTHER UPLOAD LETS GO
BABE WAKE UP NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED DROPPED
Finally a new video
The King has returned
The way I’m not American and will never need this info but just enjoy his teaching style
10:00
Oversimplified as I live and breath
I loved the ending part it was too funny
Nooooo but I’m Canadian nooo
I love that you made this. I live near the area that this happened so this is quite interesting to hear something that happened close to me.
Yay favorite history channel
How can you build a pig food farm in the middle of a pig farm and complain when said pigs eat your pig food.
Finally, I keep rewatching old videos waiting for the new ones
This is the greatest video of oversimplified
If a war broke out at that time, the UK would completely obliterate the US
American with AK, never saw that coming.
Entertaining but so, so painfully unfunny, sounds like a 30 year old trying to do fifth grader humor
Hi
I agree let’s invade Canada asap and finally take it from the U.K
So this is the war of 1812
When "I will go Home by Christmas" Come true:
Oh boy, this one really went off the tracks
He lives! See you in May when the next two parted comes out.
Yeesssasss new oversimplified
I don't know man 🤔 Canada can get stupid cold.....but I do like maple syrup....but Canadians are cool 🤔Nah, glad it's the way it is now....but now I want some coffee with two spoon fulls of Maple.....
What was that ending lol
It should be noted that oversimplified uploads a video every six or six and a half months. That means he might spend a month and a half for research, two to three for the animations, and two and a half months for a script.  It should also be noted that this video is the one episode video and the next will be a two partner.
So good!
Oversimplified: We're coming to invade Canada!!! *A few months later* Oversimplified: I miss the days when Canada had free healthcare, incredibly nice locals and there was a Tim Horton in my local tundra. Time to move to Mexico!
He's back
My day: :( Oversimplified upload content: :)
LESSS GO NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO!!!
Just what the fuck was the end
I laughed my ass off on the american description of the pig's death
So he made just made this to spite his canadian audience members.  Nice
Americans definitely in the wrong here
I'm hawaiian, and it's cool to learn more about my history that I didn't know about yet
YES
The National Emblem March is a veery nice touch
Quote and quote, "I did not see this coming."
NEIN WAY
Yes! OverSimplified
Straight line?
TeChno blAd
Love the vids
Holy shit the best concrete creator posted
OK OVERSIMPLIFIED OUT OF CONTEXT MAKERS YOUR TIME HAS COME
do one on the opium war and i’ll tell my kids you where jesus
Finally you posted
Fun fact my last name is Buchanan lol
I love the All-star reference at 7:58 very sneaky.
Hahahaha greatest ending ever!
This video is probably the closest Oversimplified has ever gotten to a shit post and I love it
When is Oversimplified Vietnam???
Grubby*
I was getting worried not getting anything from you bro
I actually heard of *a* Pig War - except it was from an episode of Hey Arnold! Since that series took place in New York, it's probably coincidence.
Annex Canada?, no i dont want to play fallout irl
33:29 another beautiful cut scream
25:00
POGGERS Oversimplified uploaded!
sory rn
Sounded like the mermaid man and barnacle boy narrator and the end.
They are back!!! Made an average day a good one
Definitely one of the best videos you made!  More.
I've been waiting for this day for months 😭😭😭😢😁
I just gave a standing ovation to the way he advertises nord vpn . He's good ❤️
ah yes OverSimplified is back after 5 months:)
The ending is simply beautiful
As a Canadian, I can tell you there is nothing we love more than pestering people in the YouTube comments about our country.
The amount of patriotism at the end has filled my heart with joy. We have manifest destiny on our side! Also the most technologically advanced military in the world, but that doesn't matter here. Just the manifest destiny.  I now understand why people love it when others take their jokes seriously. I take enjoyment from the people in the replies arguing because of this joke.
"YOU SWINE" "N-no the swine is the one i killed, I'm lyman" Pure gold
You are so awesome oversimplified!
Can’t wait for the next time a youtuber tells me to prepare for war against Canada.
I have been waiting for a oversimplified video so long, and this is worth waiting. My favourite YouTube channel ever.
Oversimplified. Thanks for the upload, I needed this.
BY FAR ONE OF YOUR BEST VIDEOS YET
Who watched this more then one time ?
Oooo
As a crent resedent of orcas island this is more information then I leared abot the pig war in school by a long shot. thanks for the vid
…hey why did you forget about Vietnamese and Korean War
Can you also maker your videos closer to get her like for example every 3 weeks like if you agree.
So... the next video is the War of 1812, then?
I love how every comment on oversimplified has like a thousand likes  (Do that here too please.)
This was a great video.  So classically yours
Finally!!! After 1 year of waiting he has posted again!!!
For a second I dead ass thought it was gonna be: “Star wars - Oversimplified”
29:18 Silly Buchanan
It's My, Density!! America lookin dense!
You know it's a made up story when dude pumps a musket
The king is back!
OS losing his goddamn mind really showed me how much of a good voice actor he is.
I'll give it a like for the Steamy McSteamface ship....
Babe, wake up! Oversimplified just posted a new video!
I couldnt help but to notice how you drew America's legs and florida's placement
the United federation of Canadamerica or the UFC Will become the one true worldwide superpower
At least Canadians soldiers can grow a beard
So where is this marshaling of an army to invade Canada taking place? I am in, only due to getting their change back all the time and not having a US quarter when I need one. Sincerely all of south east Michigan.
I was here 2 hours ago haha go cry.
Welcomed baaaaaaaack!!
I'm glad that UK parliament doesn't change that much
37:40 just DONT
Aye the god is back
The more I watch these, the more I wonder what could start a war Maybe one day in the future a war's almost going to break because someone picked their nose the wrong way
Absolute funniest one yet. Couldn't stop laughing. "YYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
All those Canadians badgering Oversimplified broke him
The end of the video was funny       I am canadian
Oversimplified... are you okay? You seem to be getting a bit deranged in the holiday season
Do a Irish video, just imagine all the drinking joke opportunitys
Drake v Kanye Presidential Election
That ending tho 😂
Rest in peace pig, you will be missed.
What an ending.  Did Oversimplified just give Biden an idea that would actually be the only correct thing he's done during his administration?  It could be brilliant.  Can't wait to put poutine under American Cuisine
This video is just one big meme.
I think I shed a tear at the end
Pin?
YES! New video!!!
so, i've been eagerly waiting forever for the next video. you've no flippin idea... dude..... uncool.  anywho... amazing as per usual, fantastic work, hilarious content and quite educational. Thank you for making these days way better. dont stop!!! :)
for me the funniest part about the ending is that there are several pro-american secessionist movements in canada right now, some of which actually have a chance of succeeding
wait, was that Morgan Freeman?
Canada will never join the United States 😍
Next video can you please make Korean war and the Vietnam war if not already and also AWESOME speech
You're a comedian and a history teacher my friend. Been watching your videos for a while. Bro I don't think you know but you've actually inspired me to go back and get my history degree so thank you!!
Amazing Thumbnail ive seen
31:00 Wut?
Let’s go i live in Vancouver and have been waiting so long for this war video
Legend himself is back
“I didn’t say they were white people” 😂😂 omg
2:35 If oversimplified made a video on this,  my social studies mark would be saved from disaster
Damn There was a war over your mother? Sad
Vietnam War when?
3:57 - 4:25 Americans in a nutshell
That ending could rally millions of soldiers 🤣
As a Washingtonian, this is the best telling of this story lol
Honestly, I feel like Oversimplified does one “real” war and then turns 180 degrees to explain wars started over things like emus, buckets, and pigs
The ending made me want to support Joe Biden
DRAKE FOR PRESIDENT!
As a Canadian, I would like to respectfully say.  I like America, but I would rather not have trump be my president
Its been 6 months since un uploaded glad to have u back and u improved
I just wondered the past few days when OverSimplified will upload new videos...
This is holy 1:25
YES YES YES NORDVPN NORDVPN YES YES YEA
Next is wild west wars pls
That ending was nothing short of sublime. I'm British and I want to invade Canada with you XD
Vietnam war please
Thank you! My evening just got better!
Canadians talkin mad shit for someone in manifest destiny range
Pigs no way there’s a war named after yer mum
Welp time to invade Canada
We could also ask.  There’s a 57.512% chance they’ll say yes to joining the US because Canadians are too nice.  Except for a select few who are bigger assholes than I am.
OUR NEW CELEBRITY PRESIDENT: DRAKE!!!! 1. Trump (success) 2. Kanye (failure) 3. Drake (???)
I thinks he’s lost it at this point
OHMYGODANOTHERVIDEOYAY
I love these vids
Finally something aboot Canada!
I went to the san Juan islands and saw this battle site in person. It was sick. We saw the british and american camps and got a junior ranger their. So glad you made this vid.
Yay
Very nice day when you upload :D
the ending had me crying
Finally
Do a video on the mexican revolution! The character design would be so fun to watch.
You happy Canadians
I’m gonna have nightmares about that pig standing on its hind legs and talking like Morgan Freeman
lmao pig war when the right fights the cops.
i hope the next video is war of 1812
I am Canadian and I live in Vancouver but I didn’t know the San Juan islands existed until this video
If the us wasnt controlled by biden then yeah an invaision would be nice
Well 1890 will be best Year of their lives Philippines american war happened In 1899  Well swine and son of a pota ina
Lets invaded Canada 🇨🇦
As a Washington (the state)  resident, this was really interesting to learn about!
Great video, still waiting on a Vietnam war oversimplified
I liked this video before even watching it
Bro, you don't talk about Brazil enough....  .... Please don't kill me.
Missed opportunity to have Buchanan hide in the closet
I start watching this guy again, and he releases a new video right when I do
i feel that every oversimplified video keeps getting more funny as they come out
Hola

Please do Balkan wars
Peak Oversimplified.
My goodness. Good luck canada.
Christmas has come early! Just what we all needed to complete our lives!  Woohoo!!!
gotta wait so long yet so worthy :>
This is his magnum opus
can you do the seven years war soon?
Yo
He needs to do the civil rights movement it would be so cool and awesome.
You should remake some of your older videos into this style, especially the world war videos.
Okay, time to take Canada
The dude didint even exist for 6 months wow tho this vid was great
me: alright, let's sleep a bit earlier tod.. oversimplified: no
Aaaahh, new video!!!
29:12 easily the best part
That ending though
3:54 Someone whispers "I hear voices all the time!" when he asked who spoke to God lol
FINALLY!!!
Ah, yes, it’s our good friend, oversimplified
I do find it hilarious how much beaver hunting was crucial to Canada's founding
Let's go
5:56 just made me die laughing 😂
13:13 The great-great grandfather of Goat Boy? Theodore Brewer.
9:38 *”If you can’t pick one channel, why not pick all 3?” - prob some crazy British or American dude*
we do call them 51st staters for a reason
I would like a deranged rant at the end of all future videos. All in favor say "Aye"
Please post the Vietnam or Korean War or maybe Afghanistan since it’s over
Oversimplified Singing All Star: 7:57
That ending made me want to die
Man I wonder what sources he uses for research
It's pronounced "barkshire."
Yes, more knowledge
For christmas we need a christmas-Oversimplified
HARNEY!!! I could see a series like Gomer Pyle starring Harney as Gomer Pyle and Winfield Scott as the Corporal.
ö
37:08 based
ITS BACK
Great stuff!
Im so hype, fav channel ❤️
Still waiting for vietnam war
From Emus to Pigs, History repeats itself again!

Well, someone has to teach the Canadians what real bacon is.

War pigs
knowing how dumb biden is i feel like we would actually invade canada
WTF WAS THAT ENDING LMFAO
Finally you never upload
Finally a Video 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🙏🏽
That tirade at the end had a VERY new voice for you.
MONTHS OF FUCKING SILENCE! THE SILENCE IS BROKEN! REJOICE!
Ohhhhhh I needed this ❤️
THE END IS SO FUCKING BASED
Damn, as a Canadian, with the current political climate, I have to say the ending is getting more and more my biggest fear mate! XD
30:30 Kyle Rittenhouse trial be like
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
Huh. If Winfield Scott had become a diplomat instead of a general, the Civil War might've gone very differently.
Their wait  Trenches dug and guns aimed If they go down they go down fight
My teacher at class be like: 10:24
Nord vpn
That’s a rat with a combat rifle lol
You have the best sponsor adds ever and I love it
Oh
It was a pretty good video but there were too many gags/jokes imo
pure beauty. just pure beauty.
How to you fix anything in line Straight line? Yea definitely a straight line
Bad Piggies music plays*
Vancouver in Canada is the true Vancouver
Holy shit that ending was great
Let’s gooooooooooo
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
YESSS
Bruh the plushie is so simple!!! I’ll take 12.
Babe wake up oversimplified uploaded again
I think he has lost it, bud I think you need to take a break from work, and start ignoring those damn Canadians with their free but poor healthcare
Pork wars
Come get some Canada we own your crap now Canadians yeeeee haw
To all Canadians upset about the ending, just remember the final words: "Biden's coming! And this time, he's coming with a vengeance!"  That's the joke. The idea that Biden would be taken seriously by ANYONE is literally THE JOKE.  (Seriously, it would be hilarious if it wasn't so tragic.)
His uploads aren't often, but he can hold your attenion till the end.
We were running low on OverSimplified, thanks for giving us more supplies
yessssssssssssssssssssssssss a vid
HOW DID YOU GET MORGAN FREEMAN      Oh
That. Ending.
YOO HE's BACK
Btw your videos why do you make them so far apart
This is the type of channel that constantly improves every video.
I'm getting the idea that Oversimplified wants to run for president of the US for the sole purpose f invading Canada
33:30 Holy sht watching Scott beating up whilst berating Harney was the funniest and most satisfying thing I've ever seen, especially in Oversimplified's booming voice and Harney's scream throighout xD
I've been waiting for months
Oversimplified is torturing us with Vietnam war oversimplified.
27:27 the island actually changes colour. I respect this man’s attention to detail
I like how the Canadians \British still tried to negotiate lol
Apparently Oversimplified uploads are so infrequent,  YouTube doesn't actually bother to let me know about them. I only found out because VTH commented about how Oversimplified had a new video.
I waited for 4, no 5 thousand years
30:45 God has blessed this man and his video !
7:58  *and they hit the ground runnin' ;)*
god is back to bless
HOW DOES THIS MAN MANAGE TO SNEAK THE SPONSOR IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
Press F for Porky... He'll forever live in our hearts...
This man is a legend even though he uploads only twice a year
every new video is 50% funnier than the last one
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
I just made this joke on the bus yesterday 😐
LOOK OUT CANADA!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YESSIR
Yessss! He uploaded
And now all the Canadians are scared.                  (The last time I posted that same sentence on a video, those representing Canada in the replies were literally getting ready to blow up something, so I feel like that might happen? Please don't blow up anything...please...I'm Canadian too-)
I'm gonna cry.......thanks for coming back😭
Still here waiting for Vietnam War Video !
LETS GO MY BOI
The funniest one yet ! keep it going, love it
the ending is GOOD
It's been so long. Finally inner peace ❤️
We canadians at the end be like: Hah, funni... They can't do that!       Wait-
We need a face reveal
oh boy he is back
OverSimplified: "Biden's coming, baby, and he's coming... with a VENGEAANNCCCCEEEE!!!" Me, a US Navy Sailor: "um, I don't think Biden even knows what year it is"
Well I wasn’t expecting that ending
Sweet a new oversimplified video.
when next video?
The Americans thought that their destiny was manifested by God because, reading their Bibles, they saw that God clears the field for winners by giving their enemies diseases and calamities (the only thing that can thwart his designs are chariots of iron, and the Amerindians weren't riding those into battle), so it seemed obvious to them that the west was being deliberately cleared of heathens who could only be redeemed through conversion.  I'm not endorsing the idea, but I think we should understand it.
I live in bc and now I know why it’s named bc
To think, even back then Americans knew that West coast was best coast ;)
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED WOOT
Ah the sweet taste of a new oversimplified episode
Bruh
Can we please see that mole now in a new video
THE KING HAS RETURNED
So it's all Germany's fault eh...
Use me as the dislike button (the video isn't bad)
3:35 big america dong
Maple syrup pass now if they had oil...
wooo new oversimplified
Was anyone else expecting an Alternate History Hub collab when he started on the What If’s?
HE UPLOADED!!!
WE MUST INVADE CANADA RN
History has kinda been whitewashed a lot,  as pointed out in the Thanksgiving-Episode of 'Some More News'.
USA
Yes another Video
I freaked out when I saw the notification like already?
Was that Morgan Freeman?
Is this an early Christmas gift, I see?
Best thumbnail of the channel
Moral of the story: Never let a British man draw your country borders.
@OverSimplified you need to do either Vietnam war, Ancient Rome, Mexican American war, Canadian Revolution or Sino Indian war. This really should have been a mini war and a waste of an upload but still a great video
THE KING HAS RETURNED
What 🤣🤣🤣
Oversimplified for President 2024, who's with me?
the end was just glourius :D
😩
7:57 I love the reference to ‘All Stars’ when I heard it I was like “that sounds familiar”
Omg. The legend is back!
The ending man ww3?
HES BACK !!!!!
Next: america-canada war (a war caused by youtube comment)
Biden sucks trump is better
Best ending in the world
YOOoO he’s alive!
Your freaking me out a little with the end there, and I’m American
Lessgo
Finally oversimplified made a new video after 6 months
And it keeps getting better abd better. I played many parts over and over for fun! What a wonderful way to learn History!
Why do the pigs look like waddles
i love your vids please post more they are fun to watch
chinese civil war pls
They just keep getting better
OverSimplified uploading a new video? CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY! By the way dude, VERY COOL! Those who like this vid... will be rewarded greatly, also those who don't... will be punished severely.
Well I guess Monday Night Football can wait until the highlight reel tomorrow morning.
"And who was it who spoke to God?" It was Joseph Smith! Where is he?  Oh, umm, we killed him.  (Joseph Smith never said anything about Manifest Destiny, as far as I know. But he did know the Mormons had to flee West, like the natives, due to murderous neighbors and an apathetic government.)
I am soooooo glad he is making vids again and I love his humor. oh shoot ur a biden supporter damn never thought. I honestly don't care thou I try not to let politics get in the way of me loving things keep up the good work and keep that sense of humor
I love our northern neighbors. They're government tho... I have a bad dragon for all of them.
Uh oh I'm in Canada
Holy sheep he's back
I’d start a war for my pig Pablo Escobar.
yesss
I feel like Biden wouldn’t be able to do it, but Canada is definitely America’s divine birthright
HE UPLOADED OMG HE F DID PPL LETS CLAP TO THIS BEAUTY
Your isp can’t see your traffic but now you can pay twice for internet and for slower bandwidth and a vpn company spying on your browsing history.
I can't believe you made a 40 min video about the pig war 🤣
Is it just me or this guy becoming even more funny
Wow, first we got a war over football, then a bucket and now a pig?! What’s next, a war over a feather ha- oh right…
When vitnam war vid
2:50 eyy it's the smalguy from last episode
That ending had me laughing more than anything else recently
babe wake up oversimplified posted another vid
YESSS
Yes the return of the best editors in the game ( life is a game ) One of my goals is to work with you, can’t wait for the day
LETTTTTSSSS GOOOOo
33:29 OMG I LAUGHED SO HARD😂😂😂
YEZ LETS GOOO
…  *Straight Line?*
A fun video as always, nice going. I hope to one day see a video about Louis XIV and a similar style to your Henry VIII or Hitler videos.
Fucken sensational
Yayyyyyy he's finally back
What we learn from oversimplified history is that every country’s history is equally  ruthless selfish and nonsensical thanks oversimplified you’re the best!!!
I was expecting a Vietnam War. Hahahaha
18:40 *pumps slide on double barreled shotgun*
bro i got spoiled due to sponsor
This was unexpected
Hes back less goooo
OverSimplified uplooooooaad
2 hours. Early?
"But here's the kicker... my letter will take 6 whole weeks to get there."   (Shows letter going through central America to get to DC)  I lost it at that
A recommendation for the next video is the Texas Revolution. Not just because I live there, but because the history of Mexico and Texas is deep and would be a perfect concept!
Absolutely loved this, the humor, the crazy ending, but especially learning about a historical event that I had absolutely no knowledge of. 10/10
Next video: The history of Joe Biden grand invasion of Canada
10:20 from what I’ve seen of the British parliament this actually kinda looks accurate as hell
you should do a 2-3 part series on the Roman Empire
Algorithm comment
Yay a video released on my birthday!!! 🥳🥳🥳
After bing watching every videos for 6months, he's finally back.
Im Crying This is BEAUTIFUL
I feel like you have some unresolved issues with canada
New animations and faces I saw:  Yee-Haw shooting  Evil laughter  Evil ganster for pig  And pretty much it
that might have been the greatest outro ever
Video was fantastic both in topic and quality. 0/10 Mounties in American colors caused allergic reaction and I nearly died.
Next up, Vietnam war - OverSimplified (Hopefully).
LOL THIS REMINDS ME OF A VIDEO I MADE A YEAR AGO COVERING THIS TOPIC!!!
As a Canadian I am now scarred for life
That ending haha.
first
This is by far my favorite OverSimplified episode...
This war is so stupid and pathetic
The president behind the curtain screaming made my night 🌃
USA Baby
VIETNAM WAR PLEAAAAASSSE
Of all the ways for this to conclude, I did not expect it to be with OverSimplified declaring war against Canada on behalf of Joe Biden  This man deserves more subscribers
37:10 chaos
he post finally yayayyayaayyaayayayayayayyaayya
I've been rewatching OS all day, glad we got a new video!
Canada can keep being a hat for now~ LETS GO BRANDON  Thanks for this video! I had no idea this happened!
The United Kingdom still own that island.
37:12 or we could have joined the axis in WW2
The ending is the most patriotic thing that i've ever seen
3:54 "I hear voices all the time" had me dead
You should do the Texas revolution
You like Biden, and Canada will be ours!!!!   Like so oversimplified can see this
they've killed Waddles :(((
The Pig War? You mean, the Great Potato War with Technoblade?
33:29 Had me rolling, especially because I can actually see Winfield Scott doing this. Despite being a seasoned veteran, he was normally very kind and gentle in manner... unless you managed to piss him off.
That ending God bless Acandemerica
Epic
BEST ENDING EVER HAHAHA
His determination in the ending tho.....
Yessss I’ve missed these videos
Best friggin channel on this whole damn site
Hate do to this but I gotta unleash my canadianness and please, we burned down the white house and held our ground when *you* attacked *us* , we won the war of 1812.
Where have you been oversimplified
I've watched that canadian thing three times its just so funny
He's back
Oversimplified may not produce often, but when he makes content, you can guarantee it'll be a banger.
Just a pig died potatos: am I nothing to you?
HES BACK!!!!!
Watch your backs Canada, uncles sams got your number
This is my favourite oversimplified video to date
Of course he had to post this during finals season. Should I study for my finance final or watch oversimplified?
More vids pls ❤️
nice
Go ahead and Invade us, you’ll only release a horror that we have kept contained. For without Canada… Quebec will be free
Ok he's done the emu war and the hog war, so are the cod war next?
Finally
See you in six months guys
37:49 What the hell am I watching
Imagine having that Oversimplified plush alongside a FlorkOfCows plush Twins. absolute twins
Animation is very good really liked the improvements looks great
"Just a pig" *Vegans have emerged*
I feel like we need a full fledged video about Canada's history
Its good to see the notification about the new OverSimplified video and what an ending. Oh boy
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE! Also Canadians, sleep with one eye open, Oversimplified might come with his army and a Pig that has cool wings and shoot flippin' lasers (y'know what i mean Oversimpllified watchers)
I’m from Washington, and this is one of my favorite bits of local history. Thank you.
this could not have ended better
No but seriously could we invade Canada?
Absolutely banger
3:55 "I hear voices all the time" lol
Oversimplified proves that good things are definitely worth waiting for. <3
Northern ireland troubles when
"That be how it will, is it?" 😂🤣  I don't know why, but I completely lost it at that.
is that Morgan Freeman on 31:07
The ending LMAO
I’ve waited 6 months for this 😃. So worth it
YAAAAAAAYYYYY
"Woah, Woah, Woah, I didn't say they were white people."
30:50 was so heartbreaking i just wanna know what the pig's wishes were 😭
He's back!
So....what im learning is when the pig was shot, he reincarnated as Morgan Freeman with his smooth voice of the Gods? Got it.....historys cool
Me at the end 😳🤷‍♂️
So good!!! Sad for the pig :/ but the friendship between the armies and the war being stoped gave a wholesome vibe about it... Good to see people reasoning
Finally it’s out
When Oversimplified Posted  someone: so uncool  and the fans punished him severly  also we totaly wont send another telegram to mexico that will get intercepted by briten to force america to declare on germany because WE WILL USE NORD VPN!
I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO AND HERE IT IS, LETS FUCKING GOOOO!!!!
its been such a long wait..
I already knew I was gonna love this when I saw the thumbnail
Loved this:)  Shows how a long simmering issue non of the higher ups care about can blow in their face.   The times never change.
But the americans keep running and they don't stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running, didn't make sense to keep sharing Oregon, when they outnumbered the brits 6-1.  Nice reference you got there :)
worth the 6 month wait for sure
You need to do the Vietnam war next please
All right boys… who ready to go to Canada
THE LEGEND BACK, BOISS
Iv been waiting patiently for this
Scary fact: animals in ancient France is put in court
The ending is hilarious
Yesss new upload
Alright another video
Catchphrase of the day: Straight Line? Straight Line.
Oh wow your mom had a war named after her
I had a feeling he'd upload soon :D
That ending was the most unexpected and ridiculous thing I have ever seen. Drake 2024.
Cringy video Yt : yes History  Yt : hell no
Upload!!!
AWWWWW YEEAAHHHH NEW EPISODE
And never again would the British Navy be summoned to defend a few remote islands full of sheep... oh wait.  😉
Why don’t you talk about Australia
It’s been 10000 years….
Biden's not coming the immortal queen is.
Omg he made a new video time to grab the lotion
Wtf  he finally uploaded!
His voice changedca lot at the end...
Every time I see a new video from you it makes me happy @OverSimplified
ohhhhhhh yeah Canada were coming for yooooooou
Out with a nother banger dude love it
Fantastic video! That ending made a whole lot of sense! 😂
Watch out Canada... I hear yall got natural resources
People back then just really hate animals don't they?
You’ll never know what this comment said
0:42 our Third, fourth and fifth presidents in the room together
This is the best oversimplified video of all time and that ending was goated
genghis khan next video
As a Washingtonian I can safely say that I'm glad not to be a Canadian
Yay another video!
0:14 THAT IS THE CUTEST PLUSHIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Manifest Destinyyyyyyyyy
My siblings love watching this Video (Their Favorite part was when Winfield Scott Beat up Harney in the Office  33:29)
I think Oversimplified has just made the case for Canada being annexed
"curves"
Clock is 4am but fuck it!
Love how they came back and now they got a sponsor
As a Canadian I'm not gonna be sleeping tonight.
Free health care
Pls don’t invade us
7:56 what song is he referencing
LIMAN shot the pig 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gonna be a good day
Ggtrrtgrr😬😨😰😥😢😖😣🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Someday, there will be an oversimplified video on the Wars of the Roses.
i thought it would be the Vietnam War video
I instantly broke down laughing when he said "Our Glorious president, DRAKE!!!" Seriously, we need to get this dude more subscribers FAST.
WHERE'S MY BATTLE OF AGINCOURT VIDEO
Wayne Gretzky Fourth of July
The legend of video has came
Early Christmas present lesss gooo
Biden’s coming? Pffff Biden ain’t done shit not will he do shit, he’s just Putin’s stripper.   But the Canadian invasion has never made me laugh so hard, props to you!
The outro is so gold
The thumbnail is SUS
the animation quality is great but the jokes have gotten more and more tryhard
he's back with nordvpn
Thank you
See you in 4 months
With Biden in charge all the Canadians would have to do is put some stairs in Biden's path to stop him.
Thankyou for uploadingg😍
OMG! OMG! it’s happening!
Yay you uploaded
bro i need more uploads
basically, this whole thing happened because america was a douchebag.  world history in a nutshell.
straight line
Interesting enough one of the bays on San Juan island is named after Griffen which is neato
We will take over Canada one day.
8:57 i live on vancouver island crazy to finally see it somewhere
32:30 got me good
All in favor of starting an invade Canada club?
Just wanted to say that @OverSimplified much like crazy General Harney does not speak for most Americans.
Canada is better
Yoooo new oversimplified video!
As a British "person" I give full support to the USA to invade and annex Canada
Based on how it went down I’m starting to think Harney really was trying to blow smoke to obscure that whole southern secession thing..In an alternate universe Pickett gets arrested and hanged and Winfield Scott Died in a shipwreck on the way back and I just visited the capital of the CSA, Richmond because that’s the only reason anyone would every visit Richmond..
Welcome back 👐🏾🤘🏿
I've been waiting for new video and here it is!
I think  I’m the 330228th person to watch this
I guess dumb assess persist throughout time and space
Finally, an epic video.
“Their not white people” oh man it got me dying laughing, such true information for the time being I love it😂
Dude then ending had me ROTFL
I just watched the end and that was fucking sus
I really did not see that ending coming.
I went to the San Juan islands a couple of years ago. Such a fascinating history and I think this is the only big YouTuber that has done such a good vid on the subject. Kudos to you man.
7:58 Can we talk about the All Star reference here?
YES FINALLY A NEW VIDEO!
“ When the world needed him most, he- *was punished severely.* “
4:11 average day in American schools
You are hilarious thank you for always making me laugh
i thought you died
Finally  a new video miss  them ❤
well now we need the chicken war
FINALLY
What DID Henry mean by “Duckies?”
YESSSSS
I'm actually worried about the ending.
Damn he really hit us with the Affordable Insulin 😭
Waiting for the Great All-American Invasion of Canada in 2069.....;)
Been a while!
Ya
YEEESSSSSSSS
Oh hell yes
Everything else it now irrelevant, this is all that matters now.
So gud
"It's my density".
Lmao I just started learning this time period in history😂 Great vid btw
My history teacher just used one of your videos!  He is awesome
I clicked the moment I saw this
I always knew you were funny, but this is whole new level. Please, never stop what you’re doing.  Very few people I will click so fast on 😅
Can we appreciate the fact that Oversimplified is so accurate with maps that he even included the cut off town of Point Roberts 9:23
OMFG!!!! FINALLY ❤
"An unrelenting negative outlook on life that affects everything around me."  Get out of my head.
America literally grew “Florida” when it ate the burger at 3:32
the lord has returned
Never clicked on a video so fast in my life
Yewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
straight line? straight line
Finally!!!
THE KING IS BACK
🐷
From the creators of hit game Bad Piggies...

Yoooooooooooooooooo NEW VID LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!
i love how whenever the american settlers show up their on shopping scooters and they always throw down a mcdonalds
God bless America
you will never find success in invading the great north.
LEzz go
lol at the end you are insulting canada ! bruh i feel bad...
31:47 Oversimplified making a character actually walk is one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever seen
I guess since no one is talking about it the pig looks like wobbles from gravity falls
This. Is. Beautiful.
its nearly 2am when im watching it and i have to wake up 7am, thanks for offering the plushie
Straight line? Straight line.
33:22  - 33:35
the US officer who talks with sheep looks like Charles Sumner
You upload every time dinosaurs go extinct 😹😹😹😹
God created Canada so americans won't feel they are exceptional
Vietnam War oversimplified when?
This is the funniest Oversimplified video. Great video
When is the Vietnam video coming out?
That is literally the greatest ending to a video!
Yes he finnaly POSTED!!! :) :) :)
I wish he brought up a joke about Quebec in the end
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED
"Straight line?" "Straight line." American borders in a nutshell
I love oversimplified
Just when all hope is lost, a Phoenix rises from the ashes. His name is oversimplified!!
That ending be like: hey you know that miniature island group thingy there that you ceded to us? Well we’re still mad about us killing your pig so time to get annexed
5:54 oversimplified. thank you for this.
Your are the best !!! Mmmuurriiiiccaaa!!
YEAH HE POSTED FINALLY
christmas comes  early
getting a little unhinged there, OS? eh?
I have never heard his voice with so much emotion- so much dramatization! I am legitimately impressed dude
That was incredible
love the ending
I love the Ending!!!!!! Good Job Oversimplified!
an almost 40 minute video from oversimplified? *grabs popcorn
When the world needed him most- He returned
Can american survive artic winter?
This is the funniest oversimplified videos yet lmao
Just when you think he can’t outdo himself… this happens
yay he's alive
The White House appears rather flamable again.
it's been so long u finally uploaded how long do these vids take anyways quality over quantity
I'm AT LEAST glad that dude recognizes that colonization is really just and invasion with a side of genocide.
*Operation Manifest Canada*
Put the gun violence and McDonald's downtown near all the Native Americans the Native Americans now be like well I guess we are in a casino now
Vietnam War pls
you should do the American Mexican war
this is the DLC to the american revolution
7:57 smooth my friend, smooth.
USA USA USA BIDEN SEIZE CANADA
ITS HAPPENING AGAIN
I love this one
Happy to see new video of Oversimplified  my fav history channel
Well it seems that he has gone bananas by oversimplification of history that he’s over exaggerating the future
FINALLY
One of the best, his videos just get better
(sees title)  mmm... yes  **PACIFIC NORTHWEST HISTORY**
I was about to go to sleep, but I saw the thumbnail for this and thought: I gotta see this! Well worth staying up for!
The ending caught me so off guard that I fell out my chair and trembled from the sheer amount of patriotism flowing from his mouth.
At least he admitted Banff is better than all American parks! Eat that Yellowstone.
Every time he uploads it makes my day!
Out of curiosity - does anyone know why it takes so long for this channel to upload videos? I love the content just wish there was more
Your mother’s fighting over me
I knew ewe would use the word “ram” for that sheep pun.
When we needed him the most, He uploaded
les go
When I opened YouTube I jokingly thought “Imagine if Oversimplified posted” and yesterday I looked at oversimplifieds acc hoping he had posted and I just missed it
FINALLY YOU POSTED SOMETHING
That ending 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can you make video about the 7 years war?
I live on Vancouver Island, and I had no idea this war was a thing.  Thanks for covering it Oversimplified, and great video as always!
Okay, but what's a canada again?
When products got more better than the main vid
Imagine if Canada would actually somehow get invaded tomorrow. Oversimplified would feel so awkward if that would happen
I want that Plushiee!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Did anybody else notice the pig is from Gravity Falls
Seriously though Canada did have a big part in both world wars and you didn’t mention them
Such a happy day!!!!
me I hope he makes another video mmmmhh normallllllll!!!!!! What!
Am I the only one that noticed the All-star by Smashmouth reference at 7:57?
His recation when the person tore off his skin and became nord VPN
But without Canada, what would keep the snow off our head?
37:18....very patriotic....
Thank god, I thought you spent 6 months working on a Vietnam war video like what people were asking for, that video would just end up be 5 minutes of talking about the Ho Chi Minh trail and search and destroy missions…
PLEASE show his videos in schools history lessons, make history great again!
He’s back
Minnesota Territory! *Finally, something about my state!*
This helped me at school im more history aware and even corrected a teacher and oversimified you should do imperialism or industrial revolution
I know it's a pretty low bar but lets all hope that our second gay president is better than our first (Buchanan).
Lol. I live in canada!!?! Good vid tho
16:01 but, but that's that's a Russian gun ;-;
PIGGIES 🐷🐷
So that is two of Buchanan's wars lets round it out with the Utah Civil War aka, Buchanan's Blunder.
I loved this video, probably your best video to date imo!
I missed you so much
Who's eagerly waiting for Vietnam War..
Plz do one for the sepoy mutiny
1:24 *Apply Cold Water On Burned Area.*
JOE BIDEN IS COMING!!! hahaha im not a Patriot of america but I'd gladly like to see canada become part of America😅
yay
I don't think he talks about Canada nearly enough
My day has been made. Thank you Oversimplified.
I could see America having control of Canada someday, but imagine all that power going to the president. Then maybe Mexico and you got the whole North American continent as US property. The US would become the largest country and pass Russia and China for the title of largest country.
38:45 I can imagine Adpocalypse 1: Part 2 (Dont confuse it with Adpocalypse 2.0)
7:58 "and the americans keep coming and they don't stop coming" "Hit the wagon and they don't stop running"  ¿Is that a swampy smash mouth reference?
welcome back 🥰
4:13 me and the boys when the enemy is alone in one building
I’m so glad I have notifications for this channel on
Hehe boiiii 🌝
Favorite video
Oversimplified do the mexican american war
good, more.
Alright time to wait another year for another upload
FINALLY!! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MAN?!
Petition for a U.S "expedition" into Canada...
Personally, I'm pro American-Canadian Unification, but I don't think we would need to bomb our little brothers to the North.
Oversimplified can never disappoint
Please do one on Vietnam war
Well that was really satisfying after 6 months of waiting.
Biden couldn’t invade his own potato garden much less another country. 😂
That Ending!!!
a new oversimplified video feels like an early Christmas.
I loved this. Never heard of it before. Thank you ❤️
Good video
When I saw that over simplified posted it made my day
Falklands 2 Electric Boogaloo
At first, Smashmouth amused me. Then you pulled your heel turn at the very end with that prime WWE style rant, and I'm just...so happy.
YEEEHAWWW!
When one of your parents is from Canada and the other American the end is just so much funnier
OS: "Over whether the US/Canada border should look like this... or like this: Me: Nothing cha.... *Looks at tiny island in nw and remembers the routing despute* "Well played, OS, well played.".
YOOOOOO! Its always a good day when Oversimplified uploads.
LETS GO BABY LETS START WW3
10:29 wh
Fun Fact! After the Civil War, President Andrew Johnson appointed Gen. Harney to the Indian Peace Commission, which he served on from between 1865 and 1868. There, he sought to prevent violations of existing peace treaties with the Native Americans, and he (allegedly) became known as “Man-Who-Keeps-His-Word” by the Sioux. However, he was also dubbed “Woman Killer” by those same tribes in reference to the time troops under his command massacred a Sioux village in 1855, with the vast majority of victims being women and children.   Basically, this guy was Manifest Destiny personified.
Oversimplified you have outdone yourself this video is soooo good
Could you the Mexican-American war next. Or Vietnam.
Finally another upload! Good Job.
Finally U come back
My heart skipped a beat when I got the notification that OverSimplified uploaded a new video
I think the ending question should be left to alt-history-hub
To me this is the best channel on Youtube, great jokes and awsome animation
I love the Morgan Freeman pig
I love the ending
19:32 perfectly cut scream
May you do 6 Day war Please
Shut up babe new oversimplied just dropped
I like oversimplified but he jokes to much in  a history video
now begins the three month wait
Me awake at 9:30 at night knowing I have to wake up at 4:00 am
Bro thank you for coming back I’m so happy
Finally!!!
I hope that ending was all a big joke
That was funny as hell
oink
OH MY GOD THAT ENDING! The video was already really good and funny but that ending and your revenge against Canadian commenters made this video your greatest video yet! XD
19:25 this scene killed me lmao 🤣🤣🤣
Joe Biden is too sleepy to invade Canada, you guys gotta wake him up first
I swear if that ending gives any Americans any ideas. Canada does not need any war, and if America actually attacked Canada under the reason of “Manifest Destiny”, no one would actually side with America. So please don’t give morons ideas. Plus have you seen Canadians in war, we a terrifying. Still a hilarious video though.
I swear to god if you get cancelled for the Canada joke, I will be mad
I loved the ending. It was hilarious
Yes! A New video. I love Oversimplified.
This is amazing! This helped me so much in social studies! Great videos! Oversimplified is the best!
As homegrown Washingtonian, this made me very proud. Thank you, oversimplified!
One of the things history has taught us again and again is it only takes one death to make history.
I love you 😍
What was the battle of hill 3234? Idk if you do battles but I think it would be fun to see it in your animation. Or when the soviets tried to make a port in Afghanistan? I think.
Based Schizo ending
“British North American”  Brilliant name
Are you kidding me? Joe Biden could not even come in his own pants!!! Weakest Presidential puppet ever!!  LOL
THE ENDING, HELL YEAH
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER: OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED!!!!
Do ataturk
WHAT
Wow cheese that hurts my ears plz talk about how Germany was a country that’s history
YES FINALLY
The Live Chat at the ending lmao
That's not Pickett, that's Ian McCollum!
That ending was funny! LOL! Also don't give Biden any ideas. He probably would do it.
Jesus-Christ, Oversimplified uploaded on my birthday! BEST. PRESENT. EVER.
Oh naaaiise
I never thought that b2-spirit exist in the past!
Hard to believe it’s been half a year since the last one
how could ian mccollum from forgotten weapons do such a thing, im shaking and crying rn
Did not expect this one
4:07 what the Bible really means when it says "You shall not take the Lord's name in vain"
Canada is the mother land
Return of the King
He just kept goin 37:17
Finally
Scott beatin the shit out of Harney is weirdly cathartic.
I am just happy about he uploaded
Hello from San Juan Islands!
Thank you
'Murica
Bruh
bro rlly hasnt posted in 6 months lmao
Lets GOOOOOOO Oversimplified has uploaded I am excited
Oh Jimmy B...
Oh thank God I was so bored
They should use nord vpn for extra stealth while invading canada
I am literally learning about this is AP US history RIGHT NOW. What excellent timing
"I hear voices all the time" lol
THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN
I just wished you mentioned Breckinridge switching sides to become a Confederate general.
4:10 “Let’s expand god said so “  God: No I didn’t   Also god watches them as they kill others just for some land “ ok I have nothing to do with this “
Just plzzz Give me vietnam war
2:00 *Looks at map of the US* "Oh yeah, it's all coming together now"
Can you please do a video on the life of Alexander Hamilton?
its funny how americans still think they can invade canada, sure alone we are outnumbered, but you forget that canada has a lot of allies.
Everyone: OVERSIMPLIFIED IS BACK   Oversimplified: alright guys I’ll just go and disappear for another 6 months
YESSSS
Yet another Saint Nicholas day present for me.
You mean the war of 1812? Didn't find the part about the war
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Only place biden is going is to the bathroom in the nursing home.
He is back!!!! Now there’s more funny and easy history.
The King has Uploaded
When the world needed him the most, he returned....
32:45  This is pure artistry
The king has returned
THE ENDING 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Ahhhhhhh. Finally!
32:32 I've actually heard this joke before. It was on an SMG4 episode.
Oversimplified amused me once again with a masterpiece. 🔥
We waited 6 months for this         It’s beautiful
When you see a oversimplifed video posted you stop, drop, and watch youtube
Hey, how come you don't mention Canada in your videos?
where is veitnam war
Can you do the Philippine Revolution
bit at the end was hilarious
The quality is amazing. I did not know this happen. Great video
i think a lot about how canada is basically "we did a genocide to have some cool hats"
I’ll never sleep again, thanks to you 38:09
here before this is on trending lmao
I ,for one, completely support an American invasion of Canada.  Those damn, smug syrup drinkers have had it good for too long.
Myth : oversimplified uploads at random time Truth : he uploads every 5 month
Can you do: The Zulu War The Vietnam War The Mexican American War The Gilded Age The Crusades Símon Bolivar and Gran Columbia The Renaissance The Paraguay War The Civil Rights Movement Jone of Arc and The Colonial Age Please???
bro that ending tho.
U should do the industrial revolution
A lot of channels with an irregular upload schedule and large following end up having a lot of hype surrounding new video uploads and because of this, one mistake can end it all. A single bad or boring video can end a channel for good in the eyes of most people. Because of this, I get nervous every time an OverSimplified video drops; the hype is usually built up naturally as the fanbase realizes that its been several months since the last video, and when it finally hits, I'm worried it might not stand up to the hype built. With this video, I finally concede. OverSimplified has grown from a small, basic channel describing historical battles and wars, with interspersed jokes throughout, to a major player in the Educational YouTube genre. I am no longer worried about potential flops. The time and energy devoted to these videos shows on many many levels. The new animation details, increased video length, and overall growth of this channel has put some major studios to shame. I hope to watch these videos for many, MANY, years into the future.
when are you gonna mention Canada?
Honestly, the ending was amazing, your content is amazing, keep it up (but don't burn yourself out)
Oh my god it's happening, a new video!   Miss you.
Was doing homework then saw that you had a new video. Keep up such good video making
A suggestion, since you made an entire almost 40 minute video about a war that almost happened because of a dispute over some tiny islands over 150 years ago, you might consider making a video about the israeli war of independence, since that could be a 3 video series (War of Independence, Six-day War, and Yom Kippur War ).
Its been a while
A BLESSING FROM THE LORD
The Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming  Head in your wagons and hit the dirt running  Didn’t make sense not to take Oregan The British my big but we’ve got guns  So much to do so much to see So what’s wrong with taking the right to be free You’ll never know if we don’t go  So grab your bows and get on the go   Hey now your in the pig war, get your wagons, and go west  Hey now you’re in Organ get your guns on and fight brits
That ending though omg 😂
Canadians arm ur selves we have a White House to burn down and a capitol to storm
How does the animation glow up every time? Like you’re so good and I’m so happy for you!
Every new video Oversimplified makes is my new favorite.
Merry Christmas Canada. Hopefully next year it'll be an American one
that pig is soooo cute uwu
yyyyyyyyyyyyoooooooooooo
OverSimplified content has greatly evolved, it is extraordinary how far Oversimplified has grown over the years. Keep up the good work man!
So Americans have been "american" for generations??
Hate to be that person but James Douglas is looking kinda whitewashed
its been 84 years
7:57 Don’t think that Smash Mouth reference didn’t pass unnoticed to my all seeing Shrek 3rd eye
LETS GOOOO ANOTHER VIDEOP
Just when you wonder why it’s only 2 episodes a year 😭😭😭😭😭
Omg it’s hereee
Let’s go to Russia
Yes!! Another oversimplified video
Really glad you had the balls to say who the president is, given that is a hotly contested political issue for some people
Keep up the good content! But could you do the Texas Revolution and American Mexican war as well as things that lead up to the conflict with Mexico's independence? I have lived in Texas all my life, so has up to my grandparents.
You make us wait only to bless us.🤌 I get it now. Great video, dude! I love your content.
Yis other vid yeah
Finally
Back when america had balls!
I paused it to smoke a doobie, because I definitely wanted to be high for this one
As a Canadian let me just say, "dude, uncool." Just kidding, loved the episode, and yes WE ARE READY FOR A FIGHT!
bro i just remembered you existed 3 hours ago and was looking on your reddit for when a new vid comes out and here we are this has happened twice this week what is going on
being Canadian that joke was very funny
i was genuinely just binging your vids thinking “it’s around the time oversimplified would post a video. hopefully we get one soon because I’ve seen the romanov family circus so many times at this point” and here you are, granting my wish.   i own you, oversimplified. i made this happen.   nah but ily great vid 💚
8:00 Mans LITERALLY driving a Volkswagen….ok il’ll leave…
2 great powers almost going to war over an island... seems very familiar.
"YOU SWINE!" "N... no, the swine is the one I killed. I'm Lyman." "AaUaAUauAuRrrRgGGhHh!"  One of the best exchanges in oversimplified's videos.
Watch Biden’s approval rating go up after this video
*What   the   fu-*
What if he did the greek wars, or the roman empire, the Mexican American war, the gulf war, or the Caribbean revolutions (like Haiti)
Indians:Hey you can't just come barging into our lan- Americans:MANIFEST DESTINY
Crusades oversimplified
I, I am complete. This is just amazing and now I'm happy.
That was the most accurate and perfect representation of the manifest destiny
If the US took over Canada, that would have been chaotic. To much land and population to maintain. Even with our decentralised goverment, that would have been a lot of work and a lot of mouths to listen to.
no way
Love the Hudson’s Bay jackets the natives were wearing. Half of being Canadian is seeing how fast you can point out that pattern on anything in a hbc commercial.
Video: random crap but is history  My history teacher: it is... acceptable
After 38 minutes I watched the pig war. I realized the pig war thumbnail is referenced from star wars episode 6
YESSIR
Best christmas present
Wheres vietnam
I have just be binge watching jis stuff today and wondered when a new vid was coming and wish came true
Early :)
Asking GERMANY to be an unbiased  international mediator?!
The place was rammed with sheep.
Vietnam?
One day British Columbia will retake the entire Columbia River. I spoke to God and he said this is our destiny.
That poor potato, TO WAR!
ITS HERE ASH FURDFJIMGOFM
Been a while since he uploaded
The legend has returned
The return of the king
Next video idea for Oversimplified: 7 Years War
That poor pig, TO WAR!
-slow clap at that ending-
Oversimplified is the funniest guy ever and he has the best youtube videos
Anybody else the pig looks like Waddles from “Gravity Falls”? 😂
As a Canadian, I am offended at the end. Biden's approval ratings are a dumpster fire, Trump almost started a Second American  Cival War, and America is made of a bunch of idiots with lower academic and freedom of the press ratings than Canada.
Finally oversimplified uploaded a video
After the ending, I have only one question: who wants to go invade Canada with me?
7:57
Babe wake up
Oh boy eh thought we taught you enough during the war of 1812 guess we’re gonna have to burn the White House again you damn hoser
Why are you so biased against America
hmmm, maybe oversimplified maybe try do a southeast asian country history like the philippine revolution and the philippine american war
PIG IS BACON
I love the ending and wholeheartedly agree
Scott got the balls to call the enemy idiots in their face
Maple Syrup is ours!!!!!
Great video lad, now, let's be prepared for the "History teacher reacts to OverSimplified" videos on our recomendations
As a Canadian, please don't invade us
Ending lmao
ham
Sister: OMG they stole that song from tik tok Me: 33:29
15:51 and other time is show an Vietnam war map in the corner maybe that the next video?
I wonder if they brought those rams to a ranch….maybe RAM RANCH
Here before 3 mil views
The animations look much more fluid!
37:22 Lame? I think you mean "publicly known"
31:02 didnt expect the pig to go all Morgan Freeman but here we are
Eel slap
no need to invade Canada. US already did that with NAFTA
HES BACK AFTER MONTHS
Did you know a barrel of maple syrup sells for more than a barrel of crude oil by about 28 times
Oh man finally! 😆
That ending was beautiful 😂😂😂
Jesus Christ Oversimplified. Don't give President Drake any ideas.
Woah woah woah. I didn't say they were white people. Has to be one of the best lines of any episode of this show.
Thank you for new vid I’ve been waiting for this forever I’m so happy
This is the funniest video yet.
Hea back
The ending….
You know, for some reason griffin feels an awful lot like mabel.
31:03 Holy shit is that William Morgan Sheppard
The only story where Winfield Scott is the hero.
and the animation is more creative
Haha I'm dying after the end of that
I never expected that ending, but AMERICAN maple syrup does have a nice ring to it. It sounds glorious
The legend has returned
This is hilarious
His voice got a little deeper
Now that got political
The ending was absolute gold.
POGGERSSSS
Man, get over your anti american history crap. People had, and still have good reason to be well armed. They had countless dangers on the american content to protect themselves against. They were not the only ones willing to use violence when necessary. Get over it. And stop attacking american history. For good or bad, its our history, and some of us dont see it the way you seem intent to infer, lately. Your not fair to the dispositions on those you make stereotypes about. Its all jokes and normally that would be fine. We can laugh at things like anyone, but you have a bad habit of taking the characterizations too far one way lately, and its not appreciated. Youve become more and more radical in your tone when covering american history. And its not appreciated. You've just lost a viewer.
Me during the video: New stuff pretty cool Me at the end of the video:        What the fuc-
Pogggggg the memes r back
I am still laughing on the epic ending, you made my day.  I think you have one of the best channel on youtube. Keep up the great work man. Two videos a year makes us realise how much  time is requiered to do the research, the writing, the animation...   and all the illarious moments. Thank you for that.
When are we getting the Vietnam war?
Love the ending hahaha
Finallyyy
Hand to God, thought he was gonna go into a Victoria 3 Spiel at the end since that games set around that time and alt history is kinda paradox grand strat games jam.
"The pig eat my potatoes!" "Keep your potatoes out of my pig"  This alone enough for war but still relatable once my father roaming around with sword around the village in search of cow who eat his cassava.
yesterday I was watching the oversimplified American civil war, wondering if he would ever come back, today, this arrived  I waited six months, and today, it rained gold  Especially the suit pig and the ending
How could he kill Waddles!
Let’s gooooooooo
You should make the next video about the Spanish American war.
no dislikes lol
So that's where the CIA, FBI, & others got their ideas from.
It’s funny how America is about freedom all the while coming up with bogus reasons to start wars and commit genocide against any non white Christian people in are path so we were sort of the nazis of the time.
Finally another one!!!!!
Me- doing homework My brain- I don’t need grades, I need answers. My mom- *stares* Me- IM STUDYING
Well Biden can’t invade Canada bc he left all our equipment with the terrorists…
Entire video: Hehe me shoot pig End: THIS IS THE MOAST WHITE BLODDED GOD DIDLY DARN MURICAN BASEBALL HOTDOG HAMBURGER LINCOLN KISSING PIE COMMIE ASS KICKING GOD BLESSED MOMENT

Noice
JUST YESTERDAY i though to myself... Haven't seen oversimified in a while. Like clockwork here he is :D
"but, being an american, he emerged from his tent with four pistols and a giant knife."  god bless america
i literally just moved from ohio to Oregon after watching the video on who should get Ohio from someone else and now it’s important    bad news, I joined and our sports team lost a lot  Cincinnati curse
Hey, is the next one is Vietnam War, i saw the indochina map to many time
Where is the Vietnam war video
The best part was the in the end,I know oversimplified was just making fun of the people who think invading Canada is a good idea but men that way oversimplified say it was awesome
USA USA USA
he returns.
Best ending ever
Pig
Oversimplify the reason why that unites it doesn't invade Canada one it will be, since we're alliance with them second off it'll be bad since then if they invade us weren't there screwed as it's not worth it for how many people are going to die it's not worth it even out with Manpower it's not worth to invade us cuz of how much trade Canada and the US make it's ridiculous oh yeah that's why the United States won't invade Canada and because they don't really care about people and most of us just freezing cold and for how much stuff they could invade they would probably not care to invade us
IS THAT THOR’S HAMMER?!
Babe wake up oversimplified video oh wait it don’t have a gf :(
he's back!
we're coming for you Canada  - Florida Man
It’s 1:30AM where I am right now, I have to be up at 6:30AM, I am staying awake to watch this no matter how tired I am
Mom, oversimplified uploaded again!
Your back!
were is oversimplified the Vietnam war please do it
The best Christmas present
I laughed way to hard at that glorious ending.
I thought he was sharing his cat
It’s extremely exciting once you see a new Oversimplified Video
Oh my god, what happened in 4:10 XD
this is the falk lands all over again
This was the greatest ending oversimplified did
Oversimplified seems to be doing well in the pandemic, totally sane, he's not going crazy, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong here. Right?
K everyone, see you in 2 years.
Oversimplified's speech at the end was amazing lol
Here before 500,000 views
"I'd worry less about Canada's curves, and more about your own curves, Benjamin." ...relatable
DAY 1 OF REQUESTING VIETNAM WAR
The American settlers were ruthless, blood thirsty conquerors that ran the natives out of their land and killed wildlife by the thousands every week. Truly, they had no shame as they invaded other peoples territory.  And speaking of shameless invasion, we've got a special message from our sponsor!
About time
Daddy's back
When I needed him the most, he delivered
Only one comment: the border treaty, in addition to setting the line at the 49th parallel, also gave the HBC transit rights on the Columbia, similar to the 1815ish agreement did.
Go torment China also
Who's down to take Canada with me???
the legend
It's been too long. I've missed you.
36:57 i feel like i just had a fever dream
Can't believe one of his blocked videos got 20m+ subs
Best final minute and a half ever
Yay your back
Can't wait for the oversimplified over the oversimplified war between the US and Canada
The king has returned!
This video has been demonitised  Reason; inciting violence  This video has been removed Reason; hate speech Inciting an invasion may not be suitable for all advertisers
As an Freedom-Lovin-destiny-beliver I really love the end of the video.
7:57 oh my god i didn't expect that to show up wth
pig
4:42  Love the towel detail
American War
12:30 Ireland: Waltzing with pigs since the 1850's
You know this could be bad because maybe a war will happen because you're inviting canada series going to be a war or maybe all country code just think ok over simplified vedas war happened!
real
classic american moment
This Ending is all Wrong.  The Americans and Canadians are now in Peace.  They become Allies in North America.  Don't get me wrong about this, I'm a Filipino, I like both United States and Canada.
ok so in 50 years gen Z will be like, aye remember that time a historian on youtube started a war to overthrow Canada
Where da Vietnam war video at
As a Washingtonian I can say that this is accurate and amazing
Ohhhhh
Gotta love the British Capts for not following the orders, truly the Chads.
HES BACK I TELL YA                                  kiss me
I LOVE HISTORY ❤
That last bit startled me so much I had to watch it again
incredible to see where the traditions of twitter came from
Part of being an OverSimplified fan:    Getting very happy when he uploads, then forgetting he exists for a while
Huh. My dorm’s literally right next to these islands. Like, on the bay. Wasn’t expecting a video that took place right outside my window.
He’s backkk
Straight line
The US getting the islands after all that is like the villain winning at the end of a movie
Can you make cc back again over
Oh, OverSimplified... How I missed you, buddy!
you don’t know how long i’ve waited for him to upload another video 😂
This is literally the best one yet. I cannot stop laughing.
YAY ITS MORE HISTORY VIDEOS I CAN GEEK ABOUT
I wonder saw that person roast Benjamin Franklin
YOOOOOOOOOO the legend is back !
Randomly looked at his channel, new video 😎
Top tier
I didn’t spot it immediately but now I am happy
average nordvpn enjoyer
American independence was a mistake. I wish Canada was larger by annexing America by Britain winning the Revolution. I hate the Revolution.  Coming from a America. I hate complications.
BUCHANAN!!
You should do the 100 year war next
That ending was uhhh quite something
Finally
Always a great day when my mans posts Face reveal?
0:49  🌝” I didn’t say they were white people..”  I’m tossin and turnin
When did this become a kids channel man
The return of the king
Oversimplified post - 🙂 I’m hungry - 😀 My mom got pizza - 😄 I HAVE TO POOP - 😆😆😆😆

Finally, a new oversimplified video
So basically, The Pigs War, is just a less violent English version of The Falklands War.
Return of the king
I love your vids XD
7:15 I’m sorry he’s got a what
*Finally Vietnam war wait a minute pig war.*
37:19 I can hear J.J. McCullough getting excited
I think we can all agree that this is Oversimplified's best video by a wide margin
Buchanan is considered one of our worst presidents ever.
POGGERS
14:35 there are no more ways to phrase that sentence 😂
Honey and NordVPN are the closest allies of Oversimplified
After 6 months he uploads. And it’s not even an hour 😭.   Don’t tease me oversimplified.
I waited almost the rest of the year for this!?!        I actually don’t mind at all, you take your time OverSimplified.
Babe wake up new oversimplified video
Perfect as always. Loved the ending
Honey wake up, Oversimplified posted.
Oh my God finally I've been waiting so long for this video!!!!!!!!!
Nice to see you in the feed again!
Nord VPN needs to make more money. Bro these videos are so good. I spent 13 hours at school came home to relax and immediately clicked this
YOU ARE ALIVE!
I have been waiting for this and now it’s finally out
Somethin to finally cure my depression
SHEEEEEESH
as someone who lives on vancouver island this video is the most patriotic thing to ever happen to me
MY DAY'S COMPLETE
I’m scared pls don’t invade us we will give you ketchup lays chips
All I can say is WOW - AWESOME video!!!
This made my day
That ending is golden
It was no draw muwahaha
Finally I though you would never come back.A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
Is oversimplified ok?
The Brits attending a Fourth of July celebration sounds like the most American thing we would ever do  *but it was the Brits*
shrersh
This is a really good video
He has answered our prayers
Nice king
its not an OverSimplified video if it isn't sponsored by NordVPN
“I never said they were white people” [OOF SIZE: MEGA]
This is the funniest video you’ve ever made
Best. Ending. Ever.
A NEW VIDEO YESSSSSSSSS
I love that ending
1:52 YOU GOT ME DYING HERE IDFK WHY
I had no idea where this was going, but I couldn’t stop watching.
I LOVE HISTORY
Pls upload Daily
Benjamin: Look at those curves. A random Brit: I’d worry less about Canada’s curves, and more about your own curves, Benjamin. Everyone in the room: *OOOOOOOOOOOOH!*
this one was so goddamn funny
Wooo more oversimplified videos
3:42 made me laugh out loud!
Yeees been waiting for a new video and its here awesome.
This is good
A YouTube video has never made me so happy
I got heavy Fallout vibes from that ending.
*Poinky ate Lyman's Potatoes* This enraged Lyman who punished him severely.
Would love to see Vietnam war covered.
I call it, the maple syrup war. See you soon funny man. We will welcome you with open arms, even if we're trying to strangle each-other.
random stranger: Do you like to be tracked?!?! Me: Wha.. no, what are you talki- NordMan: THEN YOU MY FRIEND NEED NORDVPN!!!!!!!              (i only watch your sponsors)
GODBLESS AMERICA ALSO CANADA WE ARE GOING TO FUCK YOU UP
33:30 LOL HE’S SCREAMING MADE ME LAUGH 😂
Got DAMN!!!
He proticing the future   And gave biden a idea:)
Where’s the Vietnam war video
Man I can’t wait for the Oversimplifies video on how America and Canada went to war just because of some stupid YouTube video in 2021
Let’s go a new vid
How did his voice over get this good?
Excellent.
Yess a update LETS GOOO
THE GOAT IS BACK
anybody else noticed the smashmouth reference
The G.O.A.T is back
2:30 - 2:40 man that was the fastest oversimplified episode ever!
New Oversimplified is amazing
Its official! Oversimplified’s upload schedule is 1 video per 6 months so that means by 2030 he will only have uploaded 8-16 videos.
AN UPLOAD! The lord has gifted us with an upload!
Thank you for posting 😄
I live in Washington, and I’ve actually visited Fort Vancouver! Very interesting to learn about the history behind it. Great video!
Everybody- wants history from over simplified Oversimplified- *I wild great youtuber has appeared”
I remember going to there when I visited the San Juan islands
Da end do
I have but one question Mr. Simplified what was that ending?
Papers please
God loves you
Vietnam war man was waiting so long for it
Great vid 👍🏻👍🏻
Finally the King is back
Discount
THIS IS THE GREATEST YOUTUBE CHANNEL EVER!!!!! I have watched his videos since the beginning. The quality has only gotten better. Whenever he posts, it’s like Christmas, my Birthday and Halloween COMBINED!!!
i wish drake fast a prident the world would be a better place rich people trying to go to mars and that would take 30 months even tho they could end world hungar
So Spider-Man drops soon and oversimplified is back omg 2021 is ending beautifully!
It just shows that concession always leads to defeat. US has been the aggressive one in the whole case, and they got the island after all. Perhaps Brits really should have gone for the war.
7:56 oversimplified suddenly turned into smash mouth😂😂
oh mr.terry where art thou
Hey. Could you do a video on the Taipei Rebellion or the Sengoku Jidai Period in Japan? That would be really cool!
after watching this: .....  straight line?
WAKE UP OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOADED!!!!!
Americans trespassing on British grounds?!?           *Yeah, there is a tax for that*
I wanted to comment first and here are 6.5k mfs before me...
HOLY SHIT
Dude still mad about his video being blocked, love it
Well now that we know you're coming, we can prepare to fend you off
My last name is Harney so watching this was a little weird
I know that last part was a joke (I hope) but he does reslise that we have the united nations supporting us
Make a Peace in North America
HOG RIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AT LAST
So that’s how it is huh?
the only problem with history is you know all the spoilers
someone slap this man for his patriotism, we don't want a ww3
37:19 he went all out!
Ah yes. “But, being an American, had 4 guns and a big knife”
Dankeschön Germany🇺🇸😘🇩🇪
Invading Canada? Have fun taking over the French in Quebec! 🤪
Cooooooooooool! very coool
This was the best
Looks like Mabel's pig
Nice video!  I like the part where you threaten the entirety of Canada with total domination
when is the next video
Dear oversimplified pls make a video about Vietnam War or Philippine history
We need oversimplified shorts
Yess
Get well soon ❤
Yet the Americans would run out of materials to fight since we supply them
He’s finally posting
Epic
Did...did Oversimplified just declare war on Canada?
That thumbnail would make a good movie poster!
Im a simple man, i see an oversimplified video, i click on it

As a review I will leave poggers
As a Canadian, I don't mind if you guys take Quebec
Can you do the Texas revolution next?

3:36. The US got a club for a cock

The god has come back
I'm ready to invade Canada! We can take'em.
babe wake up oversimplified uploaded
I love the happy cheers it's funny
Do I smell a mini war.

Love the vids
Another fantastic and educational video, every time you release a new vid I go back and rewatch the old videos!
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I love how the biggest tension pause weve ever had in Oversimplified history so far was about shooting a pig
i’ve been checking everyday for the past week to see if the new video was up yet, alas, the time has come.
i wish they would upload more every time i see a new one i get excited
When the world needed him, he came back
Zamn
FINALLY ANOTHER UPLOAD! THANKS
Yoooo

CANADAAAAAAA
This seems like the country equivalent of siblings fighting over the bigger half of food
I was about to do my homework, but it seems god had other plans Manifest destiny babyyyyyy!
NordVPN
Oversimplified: imagine if we started a war over a pig Also oversimplified: Yo Americans let's invade Canada
I love your videos O S I tried not laughing this entire video It failed after the I’m covered in poo and I’m the happiest man  alive part Also I’m Canadian so uh… Ima sleep with a shot gun under my pillow tonight
Easily the funniest one yet. Great job!
What’s up my 1st day viewers
I was just thinking today its about time for a video....
Watch out Canada we're coming baby
I really like how oversimplified talks about canada
New Video
It's here
Canadian: Shoots American pig (with pop gun) *ONE WEEK LATER* Canadian: O America! *weeping* Our home and native land!
Yeah. Don’t give em any ideas eh?
By far the best video on your channel, animation is great too.
You...you just made my week 👌
wasn't there a "Hey Arnold" episode about this?
OMG HE REPLOADED
AYYY
These are amazing, because my sisters know very little about history but now they like to watch these with me and always ask the question “did that really happen....?”   . Like yes sisters. History will show you how silly humans can be
this is the kurzgesagt of history
Wattles
37:48 Thought this one was a face reveal 😅
Good to see another Oversimplified video. For you're next video, might I suggest the Golden Hoard's conquest of half the known world?
Spoilers! I've opened my Google Maps and it's now in American hands
I love oversimplified His content is so funny
Favorite part is when america takes the Indians stuff
Incredible ending. I now hate Canada 👍
All I’m saying is Canada only has 6 submarines
First a bucket, now a pig... What's next!?
Any chance we'll be getting Vietnam War soon?
37:11 37:23 Wait... No... NO! NO NO NOOOOOO!
I mean, you certainly included Canada

YES
"Uh, why are you doing this, Harney?"  Harney: _Medic voice_ "I HAVE NO IDEA!"
YAY ANOTHER HIGH QUALITY VIDEO!
Finally!
Tried to sneak in those Smash Mouth rhymes there.   I love this channel.
The end tho🤣🤣🤣 That was American🤣🤣🤣USA USA USA USA USA USA USA
54-40 or FIGHT!
canadians really over-estimate their presence in the world. the toko metro area has a higher population, california has a higher population. we dont mention you because theres really not many of you around, and not really doing anything that matters internationally
Legendary ending
The quality just keeps getting better!! :D
I've always felt we should unify the continent
HE IS BCK
YAYYYY NEW VIDEO   awe only 1 part    YAYYYYY NEW VIDEO
Hold up
Pls do Operation Barbarossa
No fucking way I literally yesterday was like "He should be uploading a new video in a few days."

This is like an early Christmas gift
18:45 is beautiful

I got an advertisement for the Bay while watching this 😂😂😂
I love when this man uploads
He back 👀
Oversimplified. Thank you. I don't even need to start rolling comments at this video. Its just too good. Please enjoy your day, as you made me enjoy mine now, also my favorite history teacher will see this. Mr Evans! Hello.
In where it says it's my destiny it says its my density not sure if it was intentional or by mistake
Watching the last part being a Canuck, was quite funny
I was so ecstatic when youtube recommended this. I had been watching the catalog for the 1000 time and watching other history channels in great disappointment, longing for this day. Today I lay in bed a satisfied man(pause).
learning this in english (ik) well mainly the railroads
did i just see Americans want to invade Canada? Oh hell nah
Pog
Straight line? Straight line
POV:you can't make a bad video
All this time I thought my batshit uncle was as crazy as a methed-out mime but it seems there really WAS a war on cops!
The same month and day that was my bday
That moment when you don't even realize 6 months have passed since the Napoleonic Wars because you just watched it last night. And every other week.
After many years he is teaching us history again
As a Canadian I don’t know if I should be scared
The *British* burned down the White House? No, the *Canadians* burned down the White House
Your content keeps getting better and better
??? Omg new oversimplified video, lets go!!!!!
Canada will win
Wow
So cool to see a small focus on my home around Vancouver Island
Return of the king 👑
HECK YEAH!
0/10, too much detail to be "oversimplified"
Every once in a while I get a sudden urge to re-watch over simplified videos and once I get satisfied, and my thirst in quenched, EVERYTIME a few days later he uploads a new one. Is like as if my metabolism is synchronised
Lol
Just me who’s on their 3rd time viewing?
The thumbnail, the plushie, the video quality, its all I could ever want
Is that Waddles acting as the pig?
This is great.
That McDonald's logo at 4:14 lowkey defamation fodder, no?
Finally..
Let’s go finally another video
FINALLY
The chosen one has returned!!!
Hey OverSimplified...I don't think you talked about Canada enough...😛
0:49 The Natives could have been replaced by white people in that scenario and the expansion would have still happened and they would still would've had their ass kicked out
You can snuggle with me
impressive as always
I hope NordVPN or Honey never run out of money to support oversimplified
5:56 What the f  Perfectly cut
A grey waddles
Thanks for the birthday present man :)
Thank you for everything that you do you have helped me you have made me laugh this is about the best YouTube channel I know
what is that outro 10/10
USA USA USA USA
This video was absolutely hilarious. I love history
The King has returned
12:10 WADDLES !!!!
You know I feel like sometimes oversimplified actually hates Canada for maybe he is Canadian and just hates it as a way of hiding it
Wow what a day
Yes
Wow what an ending
Mmmmm. FartNickle
Who wants to place bets that when the south tries to secede again that Canada will occupy Michigan and solve their housing problem by fixing Detroit, meanwhile Biden personally leads the charge down South to break the news to Mitch that Trump doesn't love him
YOOO, I NEED THAT PLUSHY
yay
It's funny I was just wondering today when oversimplified was going to upload next.
37:20, the most emotional I've ever heard Oversimplified In a video
you don't know how much i missed that outro song
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!!  NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!!  NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!!
immediate classic. Well done
AND HES BACK
37:58 affordable insulin? Is Oversimplified a type one diabetic? Also as a Canadian Diabetic I can say the insulin is cheaper but literally everything else is expensive as hell
Wake up babe, new oversimplified video
He finally posted! For a long time that he hasn't been posting, he, finally posted.
3:32 America expanded its schlong
The feeling of excitement over new Oversimplified uploads gives me that nostalgic feeling of Youtube
Always wondered if you were Canadian or American, this video pretty much answered that mystery
The sky in Oregon wasn't grey so it cant be British, You nailed the Houses of Parliament though.
If Biden invades Canada I actually boycott your channel
Darth Piger with his Pork Star
If you can kill all the mooses I'll let you but these things can run over cars so
Yes finally
I think most Americans have wondered at some point why we never annexed Canada.
Everytime you upload, my brain expands
When I say that America and the United Kingdom would go to war over anything... IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, I SWEAR TO GOD.
Such a satisfying ending. 😍
Oversimplifies videos are so educational and so funnny
fuck dude ... now I want to invade Canada
OMG ITS BEEN 6 months
I only just realized that the nordvpn guy was actually the nordvpn logo, not a guy with blue hair
Next episode: The seven years war
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Siummmmm mm
Disappointed
Its beautiful
AMERICA WILL INVADE CANADA
Welcome back Oversimplified
The king is back
when the world needed him most, he returned
Bro please do the Vietnam war
280k in just an hour, can’t wait for this to be 15M views in 1 month
He’s back!!! That’s… cool. :)
Holy shit that ending was amazing 10/10 video
I can see where they got the John Wick story from...
The Return of the King
Kinda scary but funny how even the tiniest thing could start a war I guess there is merit to the saying “wars have started for less”
I hope they sell little outfits for the plush so it can be Napoleon or Marie Antoinette and stuff
Always a good day when you post
Omg finally after 16 years my absent father returned
The end tho
"Need someone to snuggle?"  Fuck you OverSimplified I came here to laugh not to cry.  Subscribed.
Seriously though, OverSimplified should make two or three videos about the 7 years war
Bravo OverSimplified! This is definitely one of your greatest videos!
Hey oversimplified, you should make a video of the paraguayan war, it's a very unknow war but it was very signifcant, i would be happy if you made a video about it
Ah yes, the Emu is back!
I hate how many idiots reduce western expansion to the most brain dead, child-like interpretation possible
This is a good video
LETS GO NEW VID
I came as soon as I heard!
0:47 racism
I laughed my ass out with that ending. Oversimplified lost it.
*“Yo wake up babe, the new oversimplified that dropped”*
USA, USA, USA!
F*CK yeah new oversimplified
THE KING IS BACK
Fuck Canada. Let's do this thing.
We're about to be blown into brits
Yey oversimplified is back making videos
Yo skedadudlers
*1 hour ago*
next is 7 years war or WW0
You know its a good monday when oversimplified uploads
Brilliant
Nothing could prepare me for the sheer intensity of Oversimplified's ungodly patriotism at the end.
1 hour an 3.8k people already commented on it.
I think that Oversimplified is losing it, guys. He seems obsessed with Canada.
Good storytelling 👏👏👏👏
Punic Wars?
"What If?" But the watcher is actually OverSimplified
I hope you make an Asia history video
One of your best
Yeeeesssss greatest YouTube channel of all time for me
this wait has taken too loing BUT FINALLY WOO HOO

Ring the church bells, for the lord hath come!
This may be the best video you've ever made lol
Should be ours 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
When is the Iraq and Afgan War going to happen?
It's been 84 years...
Merica nough said

Crazy how level headed minds prevented a war
Americans always forget it looks like Canada is butt fucking the states
31:46 imagine an anime cat girl reading that dialogue
Lets gooooo here before 3 hours.....
Yesss. An oversimplified upload!
Dude for real U.S is scary af
U.S. eh?
As a great genie once said "it's time to destroy Canada they've had it to good for too long".
OverSimplified  always makes epic content.  But, this video is the BEST one yet!!
He's getting better and better!
Press f to pay respects to spuddy
Bruh we got a russian winter ; we'll burn the White House before you get to Kuujjuaq ;)
At long last
Hail Columbia!
OUR KING HATH GRACED US WITH ANOTHER VIDEO!

Uploaded after 11 years
"Poos my pants in canadian"
Peak irony is getting a The Bay ad during this video...
YOOO THE LEGEND IS BACK
I love the story telling, It’s funny and I understand the events
Let’s goooo
Please use this comment as a dislike button (like this is gonna be disliked)
Us Canadians are sorry bud
the 6,156th comment
Ok, that ending was kinda cringe.
Bro it’s late and I gotta go to bed for school, but I have to see this video. Thank you much
America always win!
as a Canadian, i give that invasion 2 weeks before the US turns around after freezing half to death
You should do the Haitian revolution next
Return of the king
You should be a history teacher in school😊😊
What’s on my mind is that someone was payed to scream into a mic
Why do I feel like this video teach me more than my history teacher
At some point In time there will be a dead body in an oversimplified video. Someone will mention data security and the dead guy wil open open to reveal the nordvpn demon and then the now rpped body will onterrupt saying: dude... Uncool
FINALLY
As a midwesterner I fully support Canadian manifest destiny
My family came over from Scotland and thought they were living in Canada by the NY border and then when they came around to sure up the border they were actually in NY… barely
HE UPLOADED
Imagine if America Invaded Canada
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO!
Just when you think Oversimplified can’t get better, he drops this…
Annex Canada.
can you do a video about the pastry war?
I think I'm too old for this channel now
You dont talk about Canada enough tbh
YAY! over  simplified!
🐐
got caught cheating on a test today, this is a good thing to come home too
Still waiting for the Vietnam war but oversimplified dropped this masterpiece instead
NO I MISSED ITTT
3:32 so we're gonna ignore how america just grew a di-
IM SLIGHTLY EARLIER THAN NORMAL
37:19 Manifest Destiny speech that rally a new revolution
I also love how no mention of Point Roberts was made.
Christmas came early baby
Everytime this man posts its like I was given a gift
I don't know how Oversimplified keeps topping himself, but every video he puts out is such a banger
re
yall didnt need to violate ben frank like that
As a Washingtonian thank you for giving justice to this stupid funny war :D
more goddamn videos please
Okay, everything was great, and I didn’t even know about this war…..but the end about USA taking over Canada…….that’s not going to happen pal. I’m Canadian…..and it might take years for that to happen…..but Canada ain’t going nowhere.   But….if they did….what would the new continent be called?
When the world needed him the most, he returned
Nice way to start the first few days of December
Do Vietnam
As a Canadian, I believe that such actions would be unlikely and rather stupid. Our relation is great and we mostly get along, to try and disrupt the peace would be reckless; even if you did succeed you could then have a civil war within your country of people who still want to considered Canadians. The big picture of this video is to not be a dick trying to cause a pointless war that would lead to suffering, destruction of land/relations, and debt.
finally the history boi uploads on youtube
When I saw this I clicked faster than Usain Bolt
You have gone insane lol 😂
I'll donate when you put out your excellent videos more than twice a year.
I've been waiting for this.
Hey oversimplified I'll take over Canada
Remember folks, straight lines fix everything.
I refuse to recognize "canada" as a sovereign nation.
I like the accurate depiction of James Buchanan.
Make a video about Hans Island
"Wake up Honey, Oversimplified uploaded"
Oversimplified video!!!!! Let’s gooooooooooo
finally yes
Finally, the legend has returned from the grave, and has brought an epic video as a gift.
OMFG HE IS BACK WITH A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!
Well can’t wait for the Great Canadian war
Hey oversimplified I would like your take on the opium wars I know many have already covered it but I would like to see your own spin on it
Its a good day when oversimplified uploads :D
man i miss this live chat😊😲😲😲☹ but is fine i love this😎😎
I always thought the Pig War was just something from a Hey Arnold episode. I didn't know it actually happened.
all i hear is HOG RIDER as their battle cry
WHAT IN THE LIVING HELL DID YOU DO AT THE END MAN
One hour oversimplified
Pog
8:48 enough said
Just yesterday I was wondering when would you upload again and here you are
Ohhhh boyyyy
what the heck    edited : PS, Like the native skin
LESS GO
Oversimplified, I honestly think this might be your best video yet. It was ridiculously funny, informative, and just all around really well mad (even more than your normal ones) 12/10 dud, honestly
One of your best videos to date. Awesomely done 💪😎
I love your videos keep making more please
I literally just found this channel an hour ago, stop this witchcraft.
Wow it feels like ages since I last saw a new video from you!
i love this youtuber, I've watched most of his videos at least 4 times
Me as a British watching the ending: *Laughs in WW3*
As a Canadian, that ending has given me some... fear.
YESSSSSSS A NEW QUALITY VIDEO
HES BACK WHEN WE NEEDED HIM!
geez canadians, you really wanted him to talk about your country THAT badly? well....here you go i guess...
1:21 That Burn LOL
Can't wait for Druwwu to give commentary for this one.
wtf is the end of this video
37:00 find out on this episode of what if?
You can tell when he runs out of content when he is doing wars on pigs and tiny islands.
What was that ending ? Lol
This is dumb  Hahahahaha
The return of the king
Oversimplified,your next video should be about the confederate war
The final speech is better than the Gettysburg address
And when the world needed him most, he returned.
This might actually be the best oversimplified video ever, and that’s putting aside the ending
I love how he still upload the same content in 6 months!
Hell yeah new video!
Oversimplified? More Overkill
9:02 I see a face
that final part with Canada was soo patriotic that it had me saluting until the end
great video every vid gets better and better
Everybody gangsta until OverSimplified uploads a video.
The Hudson Bay company was the reason the founding fathers insisted that no corporate charter should be renewed after 7 years…whooops. Only took the monied interests of the 1850’s north to solve that by abolishing that article while subjugating the agrarian south to their industrialized capitalism and going to war when the south said they weren’t gonna play the game of being economically subservient to the north.
The Legend OS is back!
We missed you so much oversimplified. Thank you for gracing us with your presence you glorious man.
(Sheds single tear in American) gawd bluss ’Murica, that ending got me patriotic
Yeeessss Edit omg that ending is so horrifying.
5:53 when you see something you can’t even explain.
When the world needed him most, he returned
At the moment  I can barely walk but now that I am watching this video I could probably run I am so happy
Yo? Got any plans to do a cover of the war of 1812? My family has an officers sword heirloom and it's made me interested in the war overall
You literally stole this storyline from an Elwynn quest in WoW
YEAH!!! I AINT GOING TO SLEEP NOW  NO WAY IM NOT SLEEPING ON A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO
This is gonna be the next oversimplified meme 31:03
Feels like a miniwars episode, ngl
Those USA people who live North of Lake of Woods are landlocked. They must use lake( water or ice) to visit family. Other than crossing the lake, they must cross CDN border, which may be disallowed if it is closed for any reason.
THE KING IS BACK
Fuckin finally
Oversimplified Nobody: Oversimplified: Time to disappear for 6 months
Well now I think oversimplified is on a Canadian secret service list.
HES BACKKKKKKKK
finally!!!!!
5:51 I expected a joke about using someone elses wife ngl
This is an especially cool video for me being from whatcom county
The next video should be about the russian civil war like if you agree.
That was fricken great holy pig
As someone who lives on the US-Canada border, I am armed and ready for the order to invade. Just say the word.
After a long day of work, a new oversimplified video is a blessing
Let's gooooooo Oversimplified is back  Btw im learning about canadian history so thanks
the natives lost, cope and seethe
When it’s not even Christmas yet and oversimplified already released a video
That ending tho
Today just got better with a new OverSimplified video
7:38 REPUBLIC OF TEXAS BABY
The ending is weird
You gotta love the upload schedule
I claim San Juan Island as an overseas territory of Arizona
He uploaded letsss gooo
As a Canadian, I can assure you we have you over a barrel. You won't dare invade us. We control the maple syrup production, think twice before you make us scorch that earth.
Not what I expected but I'll take it XD
The pig war saga will live on!!!
Yay finally a new video. :)
OMG
KSP music at 12:30 lmao
Great video! I was having a bad day until watching this!
FINALLY A NEW UPLOAD!
The long wait is finally up🔥🔥
🇨🇦👀🇺🇲
Can you do the Irish Revolution next
Gosh, this is akin to the Shrimp Boat event in TNO.
I agree, let's invade Canada
can we just pay respects to the pig and poor Spuddy
You forgot the potato in your casualty list.
OVERSIMPLIFIED OOEN WOOHOOOO! great content
For the past week I’ve been thinking that is about time for an oversimplified video. Idk what it is but I can feel an energy whenever you are about to drop a video. See you in either may or June. Maybe April
IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY!!! I feel honored
Love how the video was made like 3 hrs after a assignment on american expansion
This whole video was violently American. Wow. Lol
Man this channel use to be the best.
The god comes upon us once more, to gift us a exquisite video.
The British throughout history caused lots of destruction sadly enough  These problems still exist today just look at Pakistan and India 🤦🏾💔
Well it’s interesting to see that apparently Pickett’s main military contribution at all points in his career was to go out and get exploded
I thought oversimplified quit YouTube because he wasn't posting anything for months thank God he hasnt
So happy to see Oversimplified post again! <3
Hey OverSimplified, make a video of the Voyage of the Essex please
Thank you for existing
Now this is true Oversimplified, we're gonna be seeing clips of this one all they way into next March!
Bruh, biden would fall asleep on his way to Canada, then he would forget why he went there and then he would blame Trump 🤣🤣
I did it I did it
yasssssss
Finally a new vid
OMG OMG OMG FINNALY MY FAVOURATE TIME OF YEAR  When oversimplified posts a video
Always great to see you in my notification box
Again the only other basically channel like this I watch is Drew I love your channel it is a great pleasure to watch and I am so happy that I subscribe to this channel I found it out
i don't think it is physically possible to ever predict when he will suddenly start talking about his sponsor
Let's goo new oversimplified upload hypeee
YEEEEeeeee
The pig sounding like Morgan freeman killed me 😂😂😂
that was amazing
America is kinda dense
Yes you back you is my favorite YouTuber
Yeaaaa so worth it
Finnaly a new video
32:30 You're an idiot. You're an idiot You're an idiot You're an idiot You're an idiot You guys are fine And you two are the most mind-numbingly-brain-ding-dong i've ever encountered in all my life  I laugh so hard about General Scoot impression about their idiocity
Brandon and the Canadians and the great Britain war starting Jemery Clarkson James bond and a bloody tank
the return of the king
Early tickets here
Weird to see the lake I grew up on, and mentioned on OverSimplified. Lake of the Woods is also a weird place to cross the border.
My favorite part is when the natives bitch about losing. Not our fault they had a collective iq of 5
33:29
As a Canadian, I don't know how that ending made me feel. Stellar video as always!
This is the perfect definition of quality over quantity
Aaaaaand now the wait begins all over again.
Best one yet
Nobody is talking about that amazing Morgan Freeman impression
I almost blocked this account at the end, seriously XD
the wait was worth it
That was great my man from Canada 🇨🇦
The legend uploaded
How to trigger brits and Canadians in one video
I as a german was very suprised to hear, that the german empire decided in the end who will own the Island.
Bidens comin baby and this time hes comin with a vengeance... Just take that phrase out of context...
Biden doesn't know what day it is. He likely thinks Canada is a state.
7:58 Good one.
Forget Kanye for President,  DRAKE FOR PRESIDENT
“I thought it was Sharon’s cat” 3:54
The morgan freeman voice was amazing! comedy gold
omg yes a new video!!!!
fun fact: if the U.S. and Canada unified into one country they would become the largest country in the world and have about 1 million square miles more land than Russia.
Now everyone knows my plan to invade Canada!
i wouldnt even be surprised if biden started a war with the Canadians, he's that bad of a president.
I know it's not international enough, but ever thought about covering the Toledo War?
Let’s goooo
I missed u
This is such an awesome video! please keep making more!
This kind of show what nationalism will do to people, both sides are very nationalistic about their nation and about their nation owning the island.
No thanks. Don't want Canada or it's voters.
I LITTERALLY JUST ASKED MY BROTHER "WHEN WILL OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOAD???"
I can see Biden accidentally starting a war tho
Ah oversimplified uploaded…. So Christmas has came early let’s gooo
I liked it before when OverSimplied was 95% serious and 5% comedy. Now even with its seriousness, it feels like the humor is forced and corny.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Seems like they're getting along.
FINALLY!!!!!1
BABE WAKE UP OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED
A new video to watch 50 times until the next thank you
hes back YAY
37:28 this is probably the thing Canadians wouldn’t want.
I’ve been waiting my friend, so, so so long
James Buchanan, top 3 worst President in history, depending on polls.
I have never seen Oversimplified so passionate than I did at the end of the video
The Canadians have taunted Oversimplified for too long, and now he has responded.
Let’s gooooo
YOOO ITS HAPPENING
The legend himself is back
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VID LETS GO
Finally
That bit that went into the NordVPN was so smooth that I watched the ad
that ending lol
YESSSS AN UPLOAD
Dude oversimplifieds segues are sss+ tier. I've never experienced a segue this smooth
If America invaded Canada it would start world war 3 No joke
I have a feeling “straight line” will become a running gag
As someone who lives 20 miles south of Victoria and has NEVER heard this piece of PNW history, thank you.
The wait was so worth it, I was in stitches and crying from laughing so hard. Excellent thanks!
Can u make a video on indian revolution just like u made on American and Russian one
Holy shot holy shit holy shit
We all know this will be a certified classic
Didnt knew they had stealth bombers back then
That ending was too good😂😂
Yes after 6 months!
UPLOAD DETECTED!!!!
omg another vid
New vid let’s watch my tv now phone
Nice to know humanity was always full of idiots
I have been waiting so long for a new upload. Great job as usual Oversimplified. 👍👍
Nice
LETS GO NEW VIDEO
THE LEGEND BACK
As a Canadian, I feel attacked and will sleep with one eye open….
hello father
Have you ever thought about doing the Utah War (aka Buchanan's Blunder)?
Great vid man but one inaccuracy is that Newfoundland was a crown colony and not part of the BNA
The Buchanan part killed me 😂
Wow, loves it, hey, can you talk about the civil war that not so civil in China after ww2? Or the third Taiwan strait crisis in 1996?Or maybe the gulf war ??
Rick Perry did refer to Canada as North Texas in a state of the state address.
A 40 minute oversimplified videoo lesgoo
Awesome video so close to Vancouver!
Ngl the Manifest Destiny to get Canada at the end of the video was hype 👏🇺🇸
I'm honestly really upset about the pig :/
Less gooooooooooooooooooo
did not expect the declaration to eventually take over Canada
God I hope the plushie is still available Friday- Payday
Biden’s coming yeah alright we all seen Afghanistan if you want to invade re-elect trump
It’s finally here
less gooooo he uploaded
This was amazing;keep making the good stuff OverSimplified!
Best channel ever, when I needed you most. you came.
It's been soooo longgggg. Missed you my guy
MY MAN HAS RETURNED WITH A NEW VIDEO!!
Just check this morning hoping you'd have an upload. I was early lol
What a masterpiece, these just keep getting better
37:08 maybe, they could have gone to war. I think I remember hearing a nasty incident in the UN Korean demilitarized zone called operation Paul Bunyan. It was that North Korean troops kept kidnapped South Korean and American troops in the DMZ. This was a problem and there was also a tree on the border line which was blocking the view, so to better see the one spot of the zone, the South Koreans and Americans tried to cut down the tree. When they saw this, a fight broke out between the two sides, but never blew up into another full scale conflict. So if fighting did break out, it would be localized to the island and both sides would probably have been court marshaled.  Edit: the mention of operation Paul Bunyan was because a war like that would be localized to that island and would be similar to what happened in DMZ as in there would mostly border skirmishes.
Its bac k mfs
babe wake up, oversimplified uploaded
Awsome dude I love how your animation has improved. I can see why it took six months.
I am felling sorry for canada
15:53 Thank you! Finally, a voice of reason. Like this to praise this genius Brit. Too bad we Americans screwed that up, again -_-
Oversimplified...are you...ok?   I would also like to ask for a video talking about the perspective of what the aboriginal population thought of everything America does through the ages.
Before 6000 gang
WHOOOOOO YEAH BABY THIS IS WHAT WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT’S WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT! WHOO!
IT HAS ARRIVED!
22:51 Okay that way of explaining was smooth as butter!
Best ending I’ve ever seen in a piece of media
i wait patiently every six months just for another video love this content keep it up see you in six months lol
I’m happy that you finally made another video
Next time its gonna be a movie alright!!
HE'S ALIVE
Lets gooooooo
Epic video
yes finally the legend is back!
37:20
Republican Americans be like: 4:10
best oversimplified video ever
See, America?  You've _always_ been obnoxious brats.
not gonna lie you’d be a really good politician
Ayayayayayay
18:44 That just good
I would really like him to be my History Teacher :((
I swear, you’re videos keep getting funnier and funnier!!  Also, don’t worry America, I’ll be sure to lock my door in the event of your envitable takeover ;) Just be sure to look out for polar bears.
I thought the griffins lived on the east cost and not the west cost
UPLOADD
Bro my Concept Map Countries are having a conflict over Curve or Straight lines
Dude’s gotta grudge on Canada.
I can only support the strategic annihilation of Canada after watching this video
This video was worth every second of waiting
In true americano fashion: (verb) GUN (literally anyone)
OMG YES YES YES OTHER VEDIO YESSSSSSSSS
Publishes video - Dissapears for half year - Publishes new video - Repeats cycle - Giga Chad-
37:47 Did anybody else notice the Egyptian eagle on the flag with black wings?
PERFECT TIMING FOR THIS VID. I just got back from shopping for my dog and I got this cute pig squeaky toy that I'm giving him on Christmas and all the sudden ... OVERSIMPLEFIED???? NEW VIDEO???? PIG WAR?!?!?!?!
Fort Vancouver was on the wrong side of the Colombia River, it should be on the same side as Rainier, not with the pesky Oregonians. Unless Fort Vancouver=Portland. But there is a city called vancouver in WA
Masterpiece!
HERE BEFORE 1 MILLION VIEWS AND HERE BEFORE ALL HISTORIANS YOUTUBERS MAKE A VIDEO REACTING VIDEO.  Tbh I’m learning a lot of history wars than school do, I think this is going to be my favorite war of all times
This channel has mostly just taught me what a plague America is and has been throughout history
Do the war against Iraq next
Please do the Sengoku Jidai!!
It's actually written in part of the constitution that Canada is allowed to be added the Union as a state should they want too
That ending will never be beat eh
That feeling when Oversimplified does a video about your home
I’d like to see the Spanish Inquisition Oversimplified.
So happy to see you again!!
"I didn't say they were white people"   I have a funny feeling this was the foundation for many of America's most destructive moments in history. For the rare few that it wasn't, I bet could be covered with religion.
upload!!
Next video : how oversimplified started a war between USA and Canada (which the canadians definitely won)
YES, finally more stuff, we miss you
19:31 I think this man was high .-.
omg u're back
That was by far the most American ending I could have ever seen.
A draw? Lol the Americans goal was to take Canada. Canada's goal was to defend off the attacks. Sounds more like an L for America and a W for Canada.
Lessgo
Aww yeah, he's back, baby
Ayo that last bit kind of sounds like fallout not gonna lie
Wait I think he means north Montana, hasn’t been called Canada in years
lol
The what if Canada bit at the end actually made me laugh. It was so funny and the voice. Pure perfection
You know you did the right thing when even your enemy general told you're fine while calling his subordinates mind numbing idiots.....  Heck the British navy captains remind me of Vasili arkipov, the Soviet officer who potentially prevented the nuclear war in the height of cold war...
Oversimplified ready to annex Canada
Got one of those plushies, can't wait to get it.
I want the plushie so bad, but I can't get it cause I'm a teenager. I don't think it'll still be available in like 3 years either.
The Pastry War: "Finally! A worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!"
Like a wise man once say: "Well, i'm off to destroy Canada. They had it too good for too long"
:]))))))
I may be an American, but I felt some sympathy for the British side after the conclusion.
AMERICAAAA!!!!
7:57 Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb so much to do so much to see so whats wrong with taking the back streets
THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!
K as someone who lives in BC, I’ve never heard of this before. I’m so glad I know now cause this is hilarious 😂. And the ending is so ridiculous I love it!
The legend is back!
HES BACK
Christmas came early!!!!!!!
I was sad Then oversimplified posted Now I’m glad  CUZ OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED
Now we wait for the reaction channels to roll in.
Honestly that wouldn’t be surprising if Benjamin actually sexualized a landmass.
3:50  That was literally what I was thinking right before he said that.
way to add politics to it and force half ur audience to hate u. big brain.
This was worth the extra 3 month wait
OMG NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED WAR

OUR LORD HAS RETURNED PRAISE OVERSIMPLIFIED!!!
7:57 Oversimplified be droppin bars
Oh wow I was just rewatching Napoleon
Great video, you really improved in the last months like better animation and voice acting.
You should do the Texas Revolution next
:)
Not a draw, An American loss to Canada!
Has america ever been chill?  They are always in war of conflict
That ending is the most patriotic thing I have ever seen. Jesus Christ o_o
But why do you have to disappear for ever before you post again? We miss you 😭❤️
lord
Dude im laughing so hard at that ending LOL
I am a simple man. I see OverSimplified I click.
7:58 HOLY THAT RHYME
7:06 The flag in the background is upside-down.

Hook me up with your plug after that outro, my god
Next video: “How OverSimplified started a war between the USA and Canada because of the legendary ending to a YouTube video about a pig”
Go get em joe take over Greenland Mexico and the rest of Latin America while your at it god bless
OverSimplified: “Now I’m off to destroy Canada. They’ve had it too good for too long.”

You know it's a good day when oversimplified makes a new video
ANOTHER BANGER VIDEO BABY
Straight line?  Straight line
Baby wakeup new Oversimplified vid just dropped!
I like how a war almost happened over the shooting of one pig, which was caused by a vague border description. And the nation to solve the issue was the German Empire, which they would both be fighting.
im one of the first, praise me.
28:45 This is the reason why James Buchanan is the worst U.S. President ever.
You don't need to explain this, I played through Angry Birds already.
Daddy is back
Christmas just came early
Im willing to go forwards with the N.A.O (if you understand this reference ily)
Hey im early

You can REALLY see simplifieds improvement over the years
I’m your biggest fan, I watched each vid 5 times
A PLUSHIE? Where do I order?
This is the best day this month, oversimplified just dropped a new vid
That ending was great, beautiful and powerful on every level…😂 If only Trump was there instead of Biden… Let’s go Brandon lol
I was just rewatching the Napoleonic wars today wishing for a new video. You give us hope for a better future
He has returned
THE RETURN OF THE KING!
Keep talking, yank, we're the ones who've never lost a war, while you've only won one since WW2.
Oh, yes
13:30 America taxing the British over land disputes? How ironic
oversimplified uploaded in december .... it's a christmas miracle
And thus, the nation of Cascadia was (almost) born!
Thumbnail looks like it would come from starwars
YAY FINALLY YOU UPLOAD
God bless this channel. That is all I have to say.
Amazing! As always. I lost it at the wild twist at the end! Love everything you've made
Best vid yet!
29:18 that shriek was so full of emotion i never heard before from this amazing man I LOVE IT

Great ending
But Canada.

Hes back!

37:08 Single best ending to a video ever 🤣     His narration just makes me feel so empowered and patriotic.  *“U-S-eh”* indeed 🇺🇸
YOOO OVERSIMPLIFIED POSED 😄😄😄😄
Wake up honey; new Oversimiplfied video just dropped.
Every Canadian is shaking right now...
Where our vietnam video
Vietnam when?
My only critique: I can only like this video once
This would have helped me a month ago. I'm sad now...
Babi pun diajak perang🗿🗿🗿
Even as a not Canadian, as an European, this ending was absolutely terryfing and the most American thing I've probably ever seen. Anyways, GREAT VIDEO, loved it!
I don’t know how, but OverSimplified has successfully made me want to rally behind Biden to invade Canada.
I’ve been to all those Islands that’s crazy
the tumbnail lol
I was just chilling, and then im like, what the hell is this, AND IT WAS OVERSIMPLIFIED HELL YEAHHHH
First buckets now pigs
Canada will invade America. With Russia and China
to respond to the end as a Canadian, no thanks :)
the tumbnail lol
The return of the king
Pig war= emu war
Our boy has escaped purgatory now he just need to help mount a rescue mission for sam o'nella

Iejfjdjdueuehdu
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL
As a Canadian, gross, Benjamin. Gross.
big fan here and love your videos
Next time: Korean War, Vietnam War, Chinese Civil War
Bro don't make us burn that white house down again homie.
I love you
- Um... Mr Biden, why did you suddenly send hundreds of nuclear warheads directly to Quebec? + Think about it Greg, we'll have all the maple syrup we'll ever want!
Straight line? Straight line.
Absolutely brilliant, 10/10 sexy pigs
Wow that outro was amazing thank you oversimplified
Yep!!! Oversimplified the champ!!!
Yes his back
I’ve already watched the ending more then any oversimplified video
Hearing oversimplified’s voice get intense might be the most patriotically cursed thing ever. (And I’m kinda into that)
Me: *sees another Oversimplified video* Pig War Me: *Attempts to hold in laughs of excitement and wonder but fails* After watching: “This man is a gift to the world.”
dude just what i need for apush
I love all your videos man but I only got one question, when’s the Vietnam war video coming out?
and thus, the supply of new memes has arrived
29:37
3:42 destined to multiply "like rats or disease"  Lol that was a good one
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Really thought this was gonna be Vietnam
As somebody from Washington I’m happy this topic is getting discussed happy that A barely known piece of history is being told
One sentence: “I’VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS!”
18:44 nothing more American than pumping a double-barreled shotgun lol
When the world needed him most... he disappeared....         *AND CAME BACK.*
the official award company has officially awarded the official oversimplified with the official best ad segway award.
Amazing!
I love how he went from war with brittan to war with Canada
This one is really 😆
Yes
Can you make Turkish War of Independence??
Scientific name for a pig is sus so that means it’s called the Sus war
THIS EPISODE MADE ME SO ANGRY....WHA....NO...UGHH......BAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
The invasion of Canada is imminent.
3:38 beautiful use of a back to the future reference 😂
Man, I just... don't know. The ending. What? 11/10, do recommend, but the ending. What a banger.
FINALLY HE HAS POSTED A VIDEO. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR ENTERNITY OF GENERATIONS!!!
Congratulations this is your best ad Segway ever 18:42 and did he just pump a double barrel
A legendary video once again!
I...was not ready...for that opening joke...I'm dying.
yee
THAT EXPLAINS WAY TOO MUCH ON WHY ITS SO STRAIGHT UP THERE MY LIFES QUESTION JUST HAS BEEN ANSWERED
every 6 months he comes back
When's the Vietnam war video coming?
Always a good day when Oversimplified puts out a new video
Still a better love story than twilight…
"Plot twist Canada wins the war and America is annexed"
He's back
29:54=Guy who can't mount a horse
I really liked the reference about the song « all star »
Nice title/screen cover looking thingy reference.
Oh my godddsssss
YAY!!!!!!! New video!!! HORRAY :3
I'd be down for a canadian invasion. also, please do the Mexican American war
This is the best ending to an oversimplified video ever
7:56 love the all star reference 😂
37:08  As a Canadian: don't get any ideas
One video mistake - Communists are the ones supposed to take over everything with ruthless collectivist imperialist tendencies!
At last. The Legend uplaods again with an educational video better than my online classes.
Ok
The ending was pure gold
ah yes, whenever people needs him the most, he returns
Technooooo
Did he just use smash mouth" all stars" there
today is a glorious day, oversimplified finally uploaded
Yes, Drake the 48th president of *"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND CANADA"*
Drake is from Canada
"Why not snuggle me"-OwO also upload pog
“I’m covered in poo, and I’m the luckiest man alive!” Is a sentence that previously was only said by over enthusiastic biologists.
My favorite history show what is it
Dear Oversimplified, please stick to the history first and foremost!  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE your content, but today's history lesson felt very different from what we are used to, especially the crazy outro!! I feel like this video was full of extra scenes and gags that took away from the learning experience. The video was very long despite this being a short story that could have been condensed into a mini-war. I think the lack or historical subject matter, mixed with your desire to make a full length video added some unwelcome changes to your storytelling! Given your channel's status, we want to see more central history videos such as the Vietnam War, the War of 1812, or the English Civil War. Your old style was perfect! With your next release, please grace us with the likes of your masterpieces, such as Napoleonic Wars, Prohibition, and the Russian Revolution; sticking to the history while not refraining to add the necessary fun we've all fallen in love with!! Thanks for hearing us out!
What the f 5:54
That final  part made me like this vid
OVERSIMPLIFIED MADE A VIDEO REEEEEEEEEEE   btw like that smash button
God, the end of this video really makes me want to invade... I dunno, Canada or something.
Securve curse
Damn bro dumb genrals
UwU new video
I'm loving these non-stopping jokes. So f*cking entertaining!
NordVPN  What the f.   Same buddy.... Same
I feel this video was only made for the bit at the end
SoverImplified
THE KING IS BACK, ITS THE HOLY GRAIL!!
That ending was insane lol
“Watch out Canadians JOE BIDEN IS COMING… AND HES COMING WITH A VENGEANCE!!!!!” LMAO that’s fantastic
Hay now you a rockstar
This is dinner worthy content
You never know how long 5 months is, till you follow oversimplified
We love your videos, please post more often!
TF was that ending 😂🤣
With that ending, I think he could be a president XD
The incredibly outdated rage face needs to stop.
Manifest destiny absolutely sucks in moral hindsight, but as a beneficiary of the existence of a single nation that stretches coast to coast I have a hard time arguing with results.
10:08 The "Middle" Strait obviously, the west Island should be owned by Hudson Bay Co. and the other two Western islands should be ours. You would thing that this was obvious, the treaty said "Through the Middle"
oversimplified means quality over quatity
It is extraordinary how far Overspimplified has come. Their content is great, the animation is great, and the jokes are great. Truly, this is the best channel ever.
I watched the premire over uploading my new video.
This is just beautiful
Oh my god he's here when I needed him
I love this channel!
And thus the great North American war started because of an oversimplified videoclip on YouTube
Such a good Youtube Channel and then there is advertisement and desinformation about shitty Nord VPN.
Everyone: Do the Vietnam war! Do the Korean war!  Do the crusades! Do a remake for the first world war!  Oversimplified:  *PIG*
Also because of Alaska we could technically corner Canada
Any chance you would be willing to present a War of 1812 video?
His talking and editing has goten so much better its amazing
Omg omg omg Oversimplified upload!!
Man i dislike the gringos when they go full nationalistic, but the ending was awesome! Hahha
Your forgetting one thing Canada never lost so we don’t stand a chance
yes yes yes yes yes yes he uploaded
9:40 You guys remember the ReallifeLore Video about the Part of the U.S where there isn't even a school, so they have to make a bow through Canada and a 1,5 hour drive just to get there? Yeah, thats right there. Rest in peace the people from there.
you r a wokester mo of ronsville
The ending was powerful, too powerful- Great job!
We missed u man
After all this time
dont be a dick OS... the second you start looking up here, we'll invite China and Russia to come hang out XD. real talk for a minute though... those Mountie's.... i will never unsee them.... so wrong....
Finally
Imagine not making a video about the Cuban Revolution
I lost it all. Can't stop laughing
finally, nord vpn guy is back!
Because I live in Washington state I actually knew all this from history class which is nifty
For YouTube math
Please remake WW1 and WW2 like the Napoleonic Wars 🥺🥺🥺 you can make 3 parts because of the depth
5:34 me wondering why the flags are blowing in two different directions
I missed you so much thanks for coming back
Just woke up and I find this😌 Now I'm truely woke
MURICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg yes omg yes. I audibly gasped when I saw this
9
I am a simple man. I see that Oversimplified has uploaded a new video, I press like.
Genuine question, what countries can’t get the Adolf Hitler Video?
What if oversimplified was my history teacher...
Buchanan crying in the curtain was funny asf
Finally another video
I have checked oversimplifieds YouTube channel everyday for the past months since the Napoleonic wars, and it’s finally here. Thank you
OverSimplified please do the Vietnam War!!!
*chef’s kiss* the return of the king!
The 51st state does have a nice ring to it.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Finally, another video.
This was GLORIOUS.  And I cracked up several times, thank you.  XD  Yeehaw, pew pew!
That ending was amazing
Yay my history teacher is here
Lel
No we have more land USA
That ending was a piece of art
Lmao I love how at 16:45 they have mobility scooters
This gave me vibes from Mabel and her pig from Gravity Falls LOL
As a Former Canadian myself all I can say is that I *might* have moved Antarctica so I could escape the wrath of Oversimplified, not saying I did but just stating a *possible* fact
Oof, all that "Manifest Destiny" talk made my stomach ache. Great video though
Nice
This video had amazing quality, I guess it might be because the last video was 6 months ago before this
4:10 had me falling out of my chair 🤣
Please don’t take this long again to post!!!!
Who wold have thought a pushing so uncomplicated would be so great
I loved watching the pig war parades on Friday harbor. This video brought me joy
as a canadian i found that ending really funny
Ok guys, level with me, am I the only one who burst out laughing like an idiot with picket was using his iron as a phone? Damn your comedy has gotten so good in these recent videos.
Wow...you really hate Canada
ngl that piggy is worth a war
He's back! Missed you.
Our Savior has Returned
Yoooo, a new oversimplified video
245K views in 90 minutes?  Amazing.
U-S-EY
FINNALY
What next
And thus the great North American war started because of an oversimplified videoclip on YouTube
At the end when oversimplified was the most powerful he ever was.
Come at me I got a .44 now in my room
Is there gonna be a tax for this?
He’s back! In pog form!!
You know, it honestly wouldn't surprise me if we did.  It just might happen if Trump gets elected 2024...
pig
Straight line?  Straight line
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RbOOOOOO FIONNNALY :D XDS BROOOOOOO BUT FINNALY JUST AS I SHOW MY HISTORY TEACHER TEH PROABITON VID AND  THISSSSSSSSS OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH FINNALLLY >:DDDDDDDDD XDS
Ahh The good ol' times at Emu War flashbacks....
Could you do a mini war video about the cod wars between Iceland and the UK
Yeah it will not make a war where the us and the uk are Allie’s
Sheeeeesh he’s back
37:22 Unsubscribed due to that little stunt you pulled.  (Jk I was never subscribed to begin with mostly cause I didnt want so many notifications in class)
Best. Oversimplified video. EVER
We all know that in the deep depths of the hearts of all americans the desire to annex canada, we just make sure to keep those desires push deep down where it can't hurt anyone
WE NEED A WARS OF THE ROSES VIDEO
I would agree on the Canada stuff, except that there's a reason why Britain doesn't own it anymore. Canada isn't worth the bullets to own
Thank the lord Oversimplified is still alive
I'm not the first to say this, but...  When the world needed him most...  *HE RETURNED*
Its OUR DESTINY TAKE CANADA🇨🇦!
A great segway to NordVPN once more.
Yay
This video is just a Technoblade reference
get your before 1M ticket here
1:15  As an American, this is exactly how I feel about Canada.
Why does the plushie look like a snowman without the carrot
Alight, you damn yanks, invade all you want. Sure, you'll take Toronto no problem. Once we mobilize the Newfies, your whole country is screwed.
HE RETURNED AAAA
funny pig
Bruh, I had a test on the War of 1812 that was 5 days ago, and now...

I’m still waiting for the oversimplified holy text merch
United States and Provinces of America or the USP(A). The name for a joint USA and Canada Nation.

It’s about time
HESFUCKINGBACK

That outro was the best thing I’ve ever witnessed
You know one day all of these war hardened animals are going to overthrow us. It’s just a matter of time.
That Buchanan bit was hilarious
DING DONG!
I love the thumbnail keep up the good work
Oversimplified: uploads. Me: Must drop everything to watch.

Gombe chimpanzee war when?

Ladies and gentlemen, HE DID IT AGAIN!!
Im always excited when a new oversimplified video comes out, its like a new halo, thanks for making history interesting man.
Amazing video⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

37:55 affordable insulin... those were the days till Joe Bidens 2021 day one executive order removing a affordable insulin executive order.

WAKE UP  ̶B̶A̶B̶E̶  BEST FRIEND, OVERSIMPLIFIED POSTED A VIDEOOOO
its been years
America got that DUMPY
YEEES NEW VIDEO
Oversimplified just a straight up genuis, not only does he give us immensly entertaining history lessons, he also shows us timely themes like the abusurdity and dark side of humanity, imperialism, corruption, and gives us smart, funny and thoughtful satire
Restart the 6 month count guys
Welcome back Legend!
ahh finally done with the video now i have to wait another 20 years for another one
6 month? worth it
The battle of marathon would be a great video!!
Oversimplified, I am a big fan, I’d like to thank you for this GREAT video! 😀
This one it's a banger. The quality has improve GREATLY. The little effects, animations and the dialogue/script use it's so good!
I saw your videos in my recommendations yesterday and though "huh, when will he upload next"   Good timing
do the mexican american war
When is oversimplified coming out with Vietnam
The return of the king
thanks for the new content!
The ending bit about taking over Canada but completely unironically.
HIS MIC SOUNDS FRESH LETS GOOOOO
Oh my goodness I laughed so hard throughout the entire video. 10/10 will watch again
Watch out Canada😈
That ending killed me
Yo, that's cool! I'm been waiting for so long.
I needed this after a long time
Ah. Good
That ending was WILD!
Weird that you didn't talked about the battle of new orleans An epic battle of even more epic proportions that could've changed the course of human history... if not for the little detail that the war was already over and the battle meant absolutely nothing
I missed your videos so much!
38:12 god bless america🇺🇸🦅
Hwn I saw the end with the usa invading Canada I was like " but I want to move to Canada "
To the north! To the south! Let’s conquer the whole damn hemisphere! United States of the west!
That ending was so good lol
Can you please stay where you are ? Stop looking at Canada as your property please it is infuriating
TOOK A DAMN LONG TIME
16:01 AK-47 does not exist in the 19th Century until the 20th Century was the AK-47 was invented
Oversimplified: and what if America does invaded Canada?  Me: Oversimplified, no
As a Canadian the ending is the funniest shit I’ve seen
That ending monologue is amazing. 10/10
Was expecting one
I would really like to see how their neighbours react when they hear some strange dude talking about invading Canada xD
That ending was the best ending to any video I will ever have seen in the past, present, and future. Good job!
Can you please do the Vietnam war?
Not the McDonald’s on the tepees ⛺️ 😂
that ending broke me
I know a Austrian guy that speeks like that. Good dud 37:43
Should have never surrendered the island could have easily slaughtered the yanks
yay!
Oversimplified voice acting is good in every video, it's even better now.
Always a real treat when Oversimplified uploads again :)
He creates good  intro's when he's about to talk about the sponsor.
Yo these vids make me want to study history😂
The return of the king
ngl if usa would invade canada the whole world would have canda's back XD like no joke canada's is nice and all but they still will always call for aide
By "pig" i thought you were talking about British and american people themselves.
I was waiting for another upload, but I am disappointed. The video is amazing, but you STILL HAVEN'T DONE THE 7 YEARS WAR!!!!!!!!!
That ending was strange…
I’m a take a wild guess and say that oversimplified is not Canadian
malta
Nice little vid on a VERY LESSER known piece of the VERY COMPLICATED Canada/US history.  THE ENDING....Is OTT!!! Love it!
The legend 😍😍
wow still doesnt mention canada
That last part
When you think Oversimplified videos couldn't get any better, THERE'S A REFERENCE TO "ALL STAR"  FROM SHREK! OMG I love this channel! 😍😍😍😍
I’ve never been more inspired to invade a foreign country! 68-80 OR FIGHT!!!
“Look out Canada, Biden’s coming!”  -Actually said by one person          If someone doesn’t make this into a tee shirt I will.
as a Minnesotan i am as Canadian as I am American
Welcome back oversimplified I missed you
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I AGREE, LETS DESTROY CANADA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7:57 Was that an All Star reference? owo'
Wow, I like your poetry there. https://youtu.be/QLq6GEiHqR8?t=682 "As far as he was concerned. Those islands were not only british, but prime agricultural lands.  And given the chance those glubby yanks wouldn't hesistate to start pitching flags, with their grubby little hands."  A+ Good sir. Lol.
yay
Es ist seit einer Stunde draußen und ich habe es schon zweimal gesehen
That ending was the strangest thing I’ve seen today
As someone who lives in Canada, that ending was 👌.
Fans: Make a video on the Vietnam War (Or any other war or anything people want)! Oversimplified: *PIG WAR GO BRRR*
I’m all for it. Let’s invade Canada!
Highlight of my week! Best content on YouTube.
That’s ballsy to make the first 23 seconds of the video straight up advertising
LETTSSS FUKCIHNG GO K
Why no TECHNOBLADE?
I literally looked earlier today at Oversimplified's channel and wondered when he was going to upload again 💀💀💀
I mean, if America invaded Canada pretty much every global superpower would make a alliance too take them down. And there is pretty much no reason so I'll enjoy my free healthcare and you guys enjoy your 20 daily shootings in Chicago alone.
4:11 American history oversimplified.
To think OverSimplified was not uploading and hits us up with this amazing video 😢
Never ask A Woman her age A Man his salary Or Oversimplified about Canada
16:01 it should be m16 instead of ak47 lol
what if this video started the war between canada and the usa?
Had to watch soon as I saw the pic
Finally you post it again this man and his non-VPN  He went insane at the end. 😂
Hands down the best history channel on you tube
We missed you, buddy ❤
It feels like a decade oversimpelified not uploading video
Scott: You two are the most mind numbingly brain dead ding dongs I’ve ever seen in my life!  Also Scott: We could wait for the the Confederates to come and apologize.
Like Canada and America are best buds now
Oversimplified’s production time explained  1 week: researching  1 month: animation   Rest of time: coming up with random thumbnails, having how should I put this naughty no clothes parties, and playing hooky with joe      Joe who    Joe mama
lol good job man i really love all of your vids they are all amazing <3❤❤
3:53  i thought it was sharons cat
1:21 apply ice to burned area
Teddy Roosevelt: Oversimplified.
Hero of history class
OverSimplified can you make a video on Abraham lincoln's death. This video was awesome by the way
Oversimplified spent nearly the entire video making fun of America and it’s people, all for build up. Build up for a joke that is simultaneously so gosh darn American but also so hilariously absurd you can’t help but laugh. Absolute madlad, I salute you.
I love your content. Im subscribed since world war 1 videos! Its amazing to see how much confidence you gained in your videos! The humor and the story writing is really amazing! Hope you best wishes on your youtube career!  P. S maybe theres a video coming about the balkan wars? I'm not balkan, so it would be very interesting to see how the conflict started and ended.
General Scott busting down the door to beat the crap of of Harney is simply the best schadenfreude.
VIETNAM
YOUR BACK yayayaysyayyasyya
Oversimplified sure got very passionate while making this.
I have to say it. As a Canadian, we DO NOT want or need the Americans to lead us. Fix your political system, then maybe we can discuss it. Besides we have the power of GEESE.
Honestly this is one of the most comical videos he's made for this channel. But it's still educational. You get the basic ideas despite it being simple and exaggerated for comedy. I've never heard of any of this haha. Also some people have pointed out he's seemed to have improved his speaking skills over time and I gotta agree. Great job Oversimplified!
Spotted dick
Pro gsmer
That ending was epic, oversimplified has never spoken that powerful before.

Benjamin Franklin "but look at those curves"   Canada: 👁👄👁💦
Must... resist... technoblade joke...
When America expands, it also grows a Florida in a private place. 😁
LETS GOOO NEW VID
I'm Canadian and I'm scared
These videos just keep getting better
*OVERSIMPLIFIED* is back baby, LET'S GO!!! Time to get some history *knowledge!*
the legend its back
I don’t know what the hell happened between this video and the Napoleon video but HOLY SHIT. This was no contest the best Oversimplified video ever. Hats off to you Oversimplified.
That ending surly was something, but, yeah, could I please have some of that health care with my puteenburger please?
This is honestly one of the funniest Oversimplified videos I’ve ever watched
The only channel in over 150 subs I have the bell clicked for!
I'm sure Canadians are really worried about Brandon
Also the ending was beautiful
This was the wildest video yet. And 30+ minutes long!
im so happy your back
Let’s just make the excuse that Canada has weapons of mass destruction (somehow) and needs liberation11!!!111!!! We are coming for you Canada, we will force feed burgers and fries down your throats!
Thank you for making the pig in the style of Waddles from Gravity Falls
Havent even finished the video yet, just got excited when i saw the thumbnail
Dude that ending tho, wth. I’m Canadian btw
3:43 Someone get me a gif or webm of this whole scene pronto.
Biden's not gonna invade Canada because of Biden-Trudeau bromance that began all the way from Obama administration.
This one was really funny
OHHhHHhH NOOOOoOoOOOO
*bad piggies theme starts playing*
He has returned
As a Washingtonian, we thank you for this video
I thought this was going to be a star wars history episode
Most Canadians would rather go scorched earth on the whole country rather than let US have it
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY = OVERSIMPLIFIED 👍👍👍👍
When oversimplified uploads , I get a sigh of releif
straight line
DO VIETNAM PLS
Did he just call Americans plague rats 3:39
i miss you oversimplified.

Amazing
38:10 lol
Finally he posted
Can you make one about the Islamic revaluation?
Dear god that ending.
15:28 A Ford Mustang and a Mini Cooper does not exist in the 19th Century
A war started by a pig and some potatoes being planted
OUR MANIFEST DESTINY CONTINUES NORTHBOUND BROTHERS! I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DISGUSTING BOARDER THAT'S TRYING TO PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING OUR GOD GIVEN GREATNESS!
I love how the voice acting gets more and more enthusiastic with each video. Very good video.
OMG I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD
*US army defeated in almost every battle, white house burnt to the ground, US humiliated by British troops parading on US territory* OverSimplified: "Eeeeeeeh it was a draw?"
Oversimplified's sponsor transition is much smoother than every game's graphics
1 HOUR BOIS
I saw the videos in my notifications and creamed immediately
Yeeeyeyeyyeey
“Get your potatoes out of my pig” !!!!!

NOTICED ME SENPAI UWU (this is a joke but yes bbg notice me)
Like always, very smooth transition
ngl i like the old voice record setup better. his voice sounds too different lol

"Go suck an egg!" I don't know about anybody else but I found it very funny lol
Well that escalated quickly
This was great lol
I'VE BEEN WAITING AND MY WAITING HAS PAID OFF
Ok...OK... ending though.
He has returned
Eh, our history has a total of 80 years worth talking about
“I’d worry less about Canada’s curves, and more about your own curves, Benjamin.” Best roast of 1783
Amazing video
33:34 How do you even make us die of laughter?! 😋🗯
The poor pig
I would just like to say, he is not going to invade Canada, we are not going to invade Canada, maybe...
Y'know, Oversimplified's representation of 1800s parliament is very accurate to modern parliament.
Yo I love your content so keep up the  good work
Whelp that’s oversimplified for the year, time to got into hibernation until next year see ya
I’ve never been more terrified about living in Ontario
14:02
This comment is sponsored by NORDVPN

Best outro ever
Best ending I have seen!
Hell yeah, New video that I'm gonna watch over 5 times, lol
7:57 love the rhym and the song

thanks man your videos always become funnier and funnier, it's amazing how every video looks better then the last love what you do man <3
Has anyone been noticing that Oversimplified is a BTS fan /Army? I am too!
Me and my fellow certified lover boys enjoyed this video
Why… I was literally going to sleep when this dropped
I want to bring James Buchanan back to life just to show him that he may no longer be the worst president in our nation’s history.
Christmas really came early
Greatest ending ever to any video on YouTube
A new OverSimplified video, I could honestly cry! Hopefully the Vietnam War video is next 😭😭🙏🏻

37:14 Ferb! I know what we're gonna do today!
HES BACK BABY
why tf has oversimplified made a vid on the pig war (that wasnt even a war) and still hasnt dont the vietnam war or the spanish civil war OR ANYTHING INTRESTING
I just want to mention how goddamn good Oversimplified's voice acting has become.
Straight line.
Damn a 38 minute Oversimplified video? What a treat!
The scary thing is that Biden would probably start a war over something so stupid like a pig because of how senile he is lol
I thought the end was an ad for rise of kingdoms like: Do you think you could have beaten Britain? But no *AMERICA*
My 5 year old screamed (with joy) when I told him there was a new upload.
People: we want Vietnam war! Oversimplified: P I G S
We have Harney Street in Omaha, NE and it's named for Gen Harney. For shame....
its 5 am here in my counrty and i got a homework to do but screw it oversimplified uploded a new video! <3

Best twist since Darth Vader was Luke's dad. America invades Canada? Drake becomes president? 2023?

Taking everyone's stuff, bible bashing without really knowing what in the book, and killing everyone who disagrees....yep thats America
I have never seen so much energy out of Oversimplified before
Get this on tending
This was the most comical yet
15:50 On the table I see the map of North and South Vietnam  Is this a hint for future video?
It's a good day when Oversimplified upload a new video..
Look Oversimplified, I get it, Canada has oil, something no American can resist, but allow me to present two reasons we don't want Canada.  A: the French, specifically Quebec. B: It means we have to invade Mexico to establish the C.U.M. zone.
A great war
Get this on tending
Oh a new video
Hmm
I just started dying laughing when I like watched the ending because I'm from Canada I do and I don't think you would survive the cold especially right now  Right now in Fahrenheit it's  Negative 8ﾟ So I don't think any of your troops could survive that soon that's like warm to me it's warm outside
Imagine if this war started

Oversimplified always doing a smooth transition to their sponsors 😉😂
Okay, I love all your videos, but I mean, SIX MONTHS!?!? It took you six months to make one video?!? You’ve made two videos in 4 months before. Next time, you owe us a BIG topic - like the Vietnam War or the life of Julius Caesar or the the whole history of South Africa!

Straight Line? Straight Line
So every border dispute that was done back in a day was straight lines? And war could have started with a pig ah yes human beings at it's finest Lmao
As a Canadian I've already signed up for the military
You left out that the US had a significant bolster to their claim - A old Spanish spoon was found on San Juan Island and the US argued that it had acquired Spanish territory and that included those islands.   It was first in time basis claim and Spain was there first and USA piggy backed their claim that evidence.  (sorry could not help the pun).  A similar claim was done for the US claim on the Oregon Territory when in 1792 Captain Gray of the US Columbia was the first person to sail down the river and walk along its banks.  He got there before Captain Vancouver who tried to beat him there unknowing that Gray had already been there.   Spain and Britain almost went to world over the Pacific Northwest in 1790s and it was resolved by the Nootka Sound Convention.

If there's a word, there's probably a war for it.

Can't believe oversimplified just threatened my entire country with war over a pig :(
37:12 and just like that, Oversimplified single handily created  a lot tensions between the United States and Canada
The Emu War, the Pig War, the Soccer War…  OMG, CAN YOU DO THE CHICKEN WAR NEXT?!  You haven’t talked much about Spanish colonization of Mezo-America and their conflicts with the French, so this would be a fantastic opportunity for you to explore that! Plus, ya know, chickens!

Technoblade starts wars across all of time, even in 1812.
I've been subscribed for almost half a year, this is the first time I've seen a new video show up in my subscription feed
I’m having a pretty bad day today, I just got in my first “car wreck” (it wasn’t really so everyone is fine) but it’s not just that it’s the fact that it is preventing me from going to watch my friend in a game that I promised her I would go to. So now I feel like an asshole. The point is that this has come at a perfect time, thank you so much for this and all you do
23:04 look at the table, ‘NAM VIDEO CONFIRMED!!!

FINALLY
I figured out Oversimplified’s uploading schedule. After a 2 part series it’s 5 months until his next upload and after a single video it’s 6 months. So I’ll see y’all again around April-May.
i imagine OverSimplified and NordVPN must be homies after all these years of history together.
I grew up on San Juan Island and the pig war was taught for a whole 2 months. This video makes me feel seen.
Wake up honey Oversimplified just posted
FINALY he's backkkkk
Yay
Before one mil views card dim what u called it....
I like how progressively through our the video the American flag keeps changing
I waited months for your new content bro hahaha
Oh this is awesome.  I've been looking forward to another vid.
They really have to do a video on the Mexican-American War next.
As a Christian, I can indeed confirm that our peaceful and just God meant for us to expand westward, by burning, pillaging, ransacking, and annihilating native American tribes.  edit: yes this is a joke, don't take it seriously.
I love the realistic portrayal of Americans, wielding gunsall the time and plopping McDonald's down wherever they can, shows the exaggerated swagger of America
Me: happy because oversimplified returned with a new video  Also Me: sad because i have to wait another few months to watch another video
Best history teacher
I love how the outro starts to not even sound like oversimplified anymore. He’s A S C E N D E D
"...Under our glorious leader- Drake"
As a Canadian, burning down the White House is the biggest achievement

1369 is the number of lightbulbs the narrator had in Invisible Man
the ending was unexpected lmao. Well done OverSimplified!
yayyyyyy finallyyyy.
I love the fact I live a ¼mile away from a river that has some historic significance. Finally something in Washington matters to HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE. Oregon has the trail. Cali has the gold rush and rail road. We have a coffee box. Now a dumb river.
Historical content aside, just as pure writing/editing/acting/animating... this is by FAR the most incredible video on this channel, and that's saying something.
The king of YouTube has spoken!
Our savior has come
i am not gonna lie although Canada's healthcare looks good on paper the long wait times to get said treatments have left many people dead. If you want even a simple mri which in the u.s you can get in a week and pay a proportional amount depending on insurance plan can be life saving. This is why in New York as an example we have many Canadians travel over the border for medical treatment although it is obviously the wealthier Canadians with the costs of passports and transportation.  And to even poke more fun at the northern neighbors their law has it where someone who is biologically male can sue for not getting a Brazilian wax job meant for females due to lets say for certain people in the comment sections delicate body parts and win as a precedent. On one hand yes people can identify as whatever they want but when it comes to procedures that can do harm it was either you get sued if you do or sued if you don't.  If any and all criticism of modern United States can be made that would easily be a 50 paged single space essay with 12 point font on Microsoft word, but my biggest gripe at least within my countries own borders is our taxation and overspending. If taxes for middle and lower income families were reduced federally better insurance would naturally be more affordable, and with a reallocation of how we spend our money in government as a you need to spend your whole budget this fiscal year or else it is cut is screwy too as if anything if they have a remaining budget the smart thing to do would be to give a smaller budget that equates to what they initially got subtracted from what was left over. Then other programs are such failures there is no need to spend on it at all similar to how it took the DARE program around two decades to run its course out of tax dollars despite the evidence showing an increase in drug use during its run time. Then there is the manufacturing and use of resources which is too regulated to make it anywhere near substantial for the population as if you go too loose corruption will rampage, but to restricted leads to an equal loss for not only the U.S government but its people as anyone who lives there can now look back to two years ago and think man i remember when i was paying two dollars a gallon for gas instead of almost four if not more in some states. Essentially everything is a clusterfuck of a mess that has continued to downward spiral that makes me think of the 2008 recession except if you were to give that steriods with political violence, use of fear of disease as a political tool rather than a health problem that should be worked against, and the millions upon millions of dollars used to rebuild cities that were burned down the past two years harming people that much everyone else involved in this video escalated to such an extent where i am now convinced most of the U.S is mentally retarded in one form or another from a medical standpoint of an IQ below 70.
JOE BIDOME                                     why i say dat
An Oversimplified video!? A good week it is.
OMG A NEW VID

Honey wake up, Oversimplified uploaded
It’s always a better when oversimplified uploads
I waited months for this
Dislike
Did good bruh
Lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
LIMAN SHOT THE F***ING PIG
Christmas cane early! Love your videos!
Glad you uploaded new video

The Pigs Strike Back:
ANOTHER OVER SIMPLIFIED VIDEO LETS GOOO
This is a certified hood classic
"it was pretty much a draw" damn yanks never concede defeat
that ending made me laugh so hard hes probably insane enough to do it 2
Technoblade be like
Berkshire is pronounced bark not berk because spoken language was long agreed upon before standardised national literacy hence all our weird spellings but you were really close saying sh'r not shy-er
Straight line?
10:24 this is the most accurate representation of the British parliament I have ever seen
No way you actually made a video????
I like the new oversimplified
Just woke up and saw that its 1 hour ago
69 min old, how ironic
Elbow room, elbow room…
Very cool video as always, also, do you think you could do a video about french history? Cus I'm sure there are some interesting stories to tell
The video is over 🥲. Gotta go another decade without a dose of laugh.
Islamic civilization is full of important events and numerous battles such as Qadisiyah, Yarmouk, That al-Sawari, the Persian Islamic wars and the Byzantine Islamic wars. I wish a dedicated episode on these wars.
And right before my APUSH test!
Lovely downplaying of Manifest Destiny.   Meanwhile, tribes had been conquering each other all over the world for thousands of years.   But when it's accomplished while using nice ships, firearms, and other inventions, it's somehow more 'evil'.    GTFO.
Yes!!!!! Finally, a new video!! This is gonna be great! It’s an early Christmas gift.
This channel is quality>quantity
He lives!!!!
4:10 - Westward expansion 7:57 - Smash Mouth - All Star
Why didnt I hear this came out
But… but… They’re americas top hat…
WHAT A GEM!!! Thank you.
Meanwhile, Canada and Denmark, both too polite for anyone’s own good, are disputing an obviously Greenlandic island, waging war by removing flag poles and leaving each other drinks <3
First
FINALY A NEW VID!!!!! its awesome i love it xd
I'm gonna be honest, I thought OverSimplified was Canadian until this video. He just seem so Canadian
god is here
WE WANT VIETNAM!!!
Babe wake up, oversimplified posted.
I gotta thank Oversimplified for helping me, because I aced my History exam yesterday. I wouldn't have aced it without your amazing videos
FINNALY, ive been waiting for this video for months
Bout damn time you post!
Seriously. Don't make us burn down the white-house again.
Benjamin be looking as straight as a cube back there...
I'm so happy because he uploaded a new video 😀😀😀
Video in the first 5 seconds. America only attacks non whites. 5 seconds later. America defeated great Britian. Those americans truly are racists. 😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶🙄
U.S.A.!!!! U.S.A.!!!! U.S.A.!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO LETS GO!

no way hes back YAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYYAYAY
Vietnam war
You know it's good day when oversimplified uploads
I was on the road towards the hospital to meet my new born child when i realized you just posted a vid. I arrived 38 mins later than expected
that came as a surprise to me 1:24
Harney is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, so they considered him still a "hero". Typical Murican.
Finally you up after half a year I’m so excited to watch it😃😃
Guy was gone for six months😭😭😭
Rip point roberts
Finally a new oversimplified video, my day has been made. <3
lol, what the hell was that ending?! xD
That’s cool and all but what about Canada? You just mentioned the British in this🙁
Love these videos, so awesome and fun to watch. Would love to watch more North American content
At least Biden isn't coming for kids this time
I WAS JUST HOPING YOU"D UPLOAD
We were all confidently requesting all kinds of events like Vietnam war, etc and he's just like heckkkk no y'all get pig war and y'all like it
Straight line? Straight line.
Typical America, I’m surprised this didn’t happen in Florida.
I find it interesting that Breckinridge is shown being concerned about southern secession when he was literally a Confederate commander
A new vid to rewatch whenever I’m bored
Honestly not a fan of the comedy part of this vid. Video quality improved thou
Release that Vietnam war video plz .
Lmao, sheriff badge on skin
I figured this would come one day. It was only a matter of time. Those are the San Juan islands by the way. Edit: I see that you eventually mentioned that.
Woah… this came out of nowhere
imagein the man in the bed was OS
Biden’s comin baby
Finally
11:56 nice
Good vid!
As a British person This still has me laughing for over 10 minutes
Babe wake up oversimplified uploaded
USA USA USA
Omg he’s back
Merry Christmas Too Mee
NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....soo....Falklands war 2 or 1812 war 2???
WHERE COMING FOR YOU CANDAD🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That trembling of the earth you're feeling is the sound of all of OverSimplified's viewers storming the Canadian border and stealing all the felt hats.
"Hide the Pain" Harney, anyone?
Do Irish civil war
As a Canadien I can insure you that that ending was terrifying.
Oversimplified fans : Vietnam war would be great  oversimplified: pig war take it r leave it
do some Canadian history
Yay, you’re back!
Was not expecting to see the word pig war today but if it's an oversimplified video I'm not complaining
Yay im early
The ending was a little extra, but cool video
All I can say is 😂🤣😂
YESSS A NEW VIDEO
Technoblade fans be like
The ending actually scared me a bit and I don’t know if I can sleep tonight, I am Canadian by the way.
brunei
Can you do a video about the 7 years war? Its like pro-world war, fought on Indian, American and European soil and has some of the most important figures of history like Fredrick the great, Catharine the great etc. Also its not entirely covered by many people sooo...... please?
Finally, after a long time it’s here!
Literally the rest of the world would side with Canada if the US invaded.
Did you think we are going to have so many wars/battles to the point where we don’t even know what to call them anymore? Like the Pig War? What.
this ending was too good😭😭😭😹
I would worry less about Canada curves and more about your own curves Beijamim franklin 1:24
YES YOUR BACK FINALLY
BTW there was another war with no casualties also named ,,The Pig War" (1906. - 1908.) between Serbia and Austria-Hungary.
Ya you are back
Me: in a sleep over That one kid in the corner: 13:06
Trending page go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Pig War sounds similar like the soup war where they went to war because of some soup getting spilled
ok, the fact it took the freaking Germans to End the "Pig War"  between the US and British-Canada dispute over islands between Washington (state) and British Columbia is honestly kind of hilarious. it's like we can't decide so we pick a random neutral country and Germany it was and they choose to give the island to the US,
That ending had my sides aching from laughing. The delivery on it was great 🤣🤣🤣
I personally believe that when the two border guys aren't arguing over the border, they're just playing with their NES in their man cave.
I wait for OverSimplified: Vietnam..
i nearly jizzed my pants when i saw oversimplified uploaded again.
Oink oink 🐷
Oh? Is that the pig! From Minecraft!
THE RETURN OF THE KING
21:27 Ian Mccollum
Well now I have to report this so we can prepare for war
just 2 hours ago I checked for new videos :[
HE RETURNS
Let's go new video
Oversimplified: uploads a video  Me: EVERYONE MOVE!!!!!!!!!! I NEED TO SEE THE NEWEST OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!! AND I NEED TO GET HOT CHOCOLATE 🍫 TO WATCH DURING THE VIDEO!!!!!!!  (True story)
LETS GOOO
If america tried to invade Canada imagine Vietnam but replace dense jungle with small amounts of inexperienced troops imagine freeze info cold the Americans aren’t used to and large amounts of Canadian forces much more experienced and much better at the cold than america so america would be absolutely embarrassed
The ending caught me off guard
thats the cutest pig I have ever seen
18:40 Lyman: *So lazy he cocks his double barrel like a pump* Gun: “Works for me.”
YOOOOOO HE POSTED!
YESSS
I still waiting for vietnam war
Bless this channel and its creator
US of A, BAYBEEEEH
4:14 Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit does not exist in the 19th Century until was Introduction in the 20th Century
Hry oversimplified, please please make a video about India. IT'S MY HUMBLE REQUEST TO YOU.
YES A NEW VIDEO
Freedom is the only way no
3:40 “IT’S MY DENSITY!”  Actually very accurate lmao
Yea let’s go new vid
OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO BABY TODAY IS THE BEST DAY

"Then you my friend, should use nooord vpn"  " *what the fu* "
USA might always get their way ... But at least we got gun control and free health care in Canada 😏 I know you jealous America
He returns!!
the pig war  technoblade: 👁👄👁
One more video for Youtube to eternally reccomend me no mather how many times I've seen it.
Bout time
The production quality and creativity gets better ever video
I thought this episode was about War Pigs by Black Sabbath.
The part about the British and American armies actually getting along and enjoying one another's company reminds me of how, on YouTube, the only conversations you see between Americans and British are petty, fractious bickering about whose nation is superior. Yet, if one meets another face-to-face, everyone has a good time.
Today i was litrealy thinking hmmm oversimpelfied should make a video right around now and boom there it is it even has the war of 1812 in it a bit
Christmas has come early
Best channel on YouTube… change my mind
Excuse me the what war
you know it a good day when oversimplified uploads in the middle of covid 19
*scrolls through recommendations*  Hmm not much *sees new oversimplified video* YES YES YES YES
I missed this..
These videos get better everytime
WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST HE RETURNED
O America! Our home and native land! True patriot love thou dost in us command. We see thee rising fair, dear land, The True North, strong and free; And stand on guard, O America, We stand on guard for thee.   (Refrain) O America! O America! O America! We stand on guard for thee, O America! We stand on guard for thee.   O America! Where pines and maples grow, Great prairies spread and lordly rivers flow, How dear to us thy broad domain, From East to Western sea! Thou land of hope for all who toil! Thou True North, strong and free! (Refrain)   O America! Beneath thy shining skies May stalwart sons and gentle maidens rise, To keep thee steadfast through the years From East to Western sea, Our own beloved native land, Our True North, strong and free! (Refrain)   Ruler Supreme, Who hearest humble prayer, Hold our dominion within Thy loving care. Help us to find, O God, in Thee A lasting, rich reward, As waiting for the Better Day, We ever stand on guard.  Please don't kill me
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED LETS GO BOYS
oversimplified is going all-out in this video
Just when I thought the great Emu war was crazy, America raises the bar again.  Bravo.
Been waiting all year for this
Please cover Vietnam next everyone is looking forward to it
I love that to show how idiotic Harney and Pickett were, they are using a banana and an iron as phones in a time where phones don’t exist. M’wah
1:27 lol
rip pig
ccomment
11:08 it's been so long
babe wake up new oversimplified video dropped
Omg the ending is so funny watch out Canada
Thomas Jefferson: All men are equal. Natives: Not based on their color and origin right? Thomas: *looks @ them intently* Natives: Not based on their color and origin.... right?
4:11 Tommy Guns and McDonald's does not exist in the 19th Century until which is invented and founded in the 20th Century
I'd love to see one of your vidios about the Balcanic wars
That first bit was gold
He needs to drop more videos we always just wait for him to drop something on I love I've watched most of these videos twice three times four times so I would love to see more
If ur an American u have guns
Every time i here pickett all I think about is Pickett's charge
Why set up a McDonald’s?
LETS GOOOO
I missed youuuuuuuu! Yaaay!  Gosh this is just what i needed right now !
You threw enough woke jargon into the narrative to destroy the video.  Unsubscribed.
Oversimplified dropped a new video!!!!
You never talked about Mexico
I love how it's getting more and more chaotic, and its awesome.
BIDEN IS COMING TO CANADA
Premiered **69** Minutes ago
Why does the editing look a lot cleaner and smoother 🤔
That’s not a nice name to call Americans
NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED
The shooting of this pig is more emotional and dramatic than that of Franz Ferdinand.
I was just thinking "its been a while since the last OverSimplified video i wonder when he's going to upload another"
FINALLY, A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO!!!!!
This video seems a bi- very bias
Oversimplified and Bill Wurtz should collab. It would be so brilliant :D
O my god been waiting for the pogg pig
Is this a dream, I just woke up to oversimplified uploading!!!! I've been waiting for 6 months. I'm glad you're back! :DDD
The character movements and expressions improve so much in every video and I love it
Canada, watch out.
meow    i just wanted to see if anyone would like a comment that was literally just meow
Ah yes, time for him to disappear for another 6 months.
31:03 LOL that's an instant classic
that ending
I wish these videos existed when I was in middle school....
could you please do the vietnam war next
Oh an Oversimplified upload? My week just got way better along with the Camila Cuevas and Dead Sound uploads!
Finally a new video
“Killed your pig” (doom music plays)
Oversimplified? There's a tax for that.
Claim your 1h ticket here
another great episode
That was the most legendary ending ever in oversimplified history  Edit: damn I wasn't ready for this amount of likes, thank you
A surprise to be sure, but indeed a very welcome one
Yeet finally
i swear we were learning about this in school today 😳
look at those curves what happend next was savage 1:24
19:35 would say that he shouldn't be fighting over a pig, but as someone who shows pigs he is perfectly rational because my pig is like a son to me
“Honey, come to the hospital! Hurry!” “I can’t rn, OverSimplified just uploaded a new vid” “I am literally about to give birth to our firstborn!”  “Did I stutter?!”
I have waited so long for his new video.
Fact check the Canadians burnt down the white house
7:57 oversimplified is a legend, he snuck All Star into his script
Long time no see, now, get rid of this dumb ad Youtube and GIVE ME HISTORY! OR GIVE ME DEATH!
my favorite part is the your an idiot
POG
3:42 is that a combat shotgun from fallout 4 hahaha
Time to conquer Canada.
‘MERICA
HEESSSS BACKKK
Sheesh
You know it's a good day when Oversimplified uploads
Can you make a video about Puerto Rico 🇵🇷😃
Can you make a video bout indian wars?
Yay
During the premier of this vid, so much of the live chat was "USA" "USA" "USA" like they didn't watch the first five minutes, which explained the stupidity and hypocrisy of USA policy and philosophy, particularly at that time.  Honestly, I'm embarrassed for my country.
I’ve been waiting so long thank u so much
7:57 best cover of all time
Finally a new video
37:09 reminds me of Fallout.
Dude… VERY COOL!
34:06 Forget Santa, Queen Victoria gotta travel the world to make an appearance at all her Birthday Parties🤧
I fully support the invasion of Canada
Lemme predict what the pig war is about,   It’s about the North West corner of the Country/Oregon/Washington
I Missed this channel..more videos please
I think oversimplified is starting to lose it
Should we be worried about the ending?
Given Biden dementia This might happen
sup
PLEASE DO CHINESE / ASIAN HISTORY OF SOME SORT NEXT!!!!! Reply and like if u agree
yay
Oversimplified has mastered introducing ads in an interesting way.
is this just the prequel to the bay of pigs invasion?
W upload schedule
Love the 54-40 reference
New oversimplified, yes!
So this was the Bay of Pigs my teacher was talking about!
Great video! See you in 5 to 6 months
Oversimplifies 2 sponsors 1 : Nord VPN 2 : skilshare
oversimplfied uploads me fck this i need to see this glory
You used waddles from gravity falls as a draw reference for the pigs didn't you.
BEST VIDEO EVER. PERIOD
Americans: I'm awesome Brits: I'm not too bad. Obviously I'm bad because, life, but I definitely have room to be worse
OGMOGGMGMMGGMGMG
he finally came back
3:35 Manifest destiny is also another word
OverSimplified - This is QUALITY!
Lets goo hes here
3:35. Holy shit, Florida!
How about the Boxer Rebellion next?
Praise every form of religion I must say has returned
I am cooming
I'M CRYING! THAT WAS AMAZING!
Biden's coming for you had me dead.
I dream that he uploads, then he uploads. Coincidence? I. THINK. NOT!!!
0:47 “I didn’t say they were white people.” 😂
58 mins late
Is it just me or is his videos becoming better with each upload?
Ah nice to see I HATE MY LIFE join the ranks of straight line for memorable oversimplified quotes.
It’s taken so long for you to upload finally!
Can you do vietnam next
YAAASSSSSSS
We have a Pig War, an Emu War, all we need is a Meat War (you can guess where that’s taking place)
been waiting 6 months for this one! excited to watch it :)
Oversimplified for US President 2024.  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 He will spearhead the annexation of Canada as US territory. #Oversimplified2024  Btw, Hudson Bay Company still exists today as a Canadian clothing retail company.
I love you oversimplified! Please marry my pig, he is called Brian. X
Hi
Always a good day when oversimplified posts.
Good
your editing has gotten so much better through the years :D
Oversimplified plush???        I N V E S T
at 3:41 . Thats not a rat I've ever seen.
NGL, that ad placement was smooth af.
Can we get like The Texas Revolution or something with USA and Mexico maybe the American And Mexican war?
The youtuber i was thinking of
Fun fact:There are still those in the U.S. that still believe that Canada is still allowed with "No strings attached" to join the U.S. if they wish. As much as I laugh at the BS differences between the U.S. and Canada... (the U.S.'s favorite hat and family)... we will never give up the West.
The guy's pig looks like wilbur
WAKE UP BABE! NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO JUST DROPPED
7:57 Yeah i was not expecting to hear smash mouth in an oversimplified video
This is the best video you’ve ever made!😂  That ending was pure gold!  USA USA USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Since Australia was British when they declared war on emu's, Yes the answer is YES we would go to war over a pig 😎
Could you do German and Italian unification next?
“What is the pig war?” “IT’S A WAR ABOUT PIGS YOU UNCULTURED SWINE”
bruh i swear this happened with my friends and I in our Minecraft world
This isn't a YouTube video, this is a full on show
see you in 6 months
Hands-down the best video you got yet.
LETS GOOO, New oversimplified video
This video has the best oversimplified ending
4:12 literally the best idea ever🤣💯
I'm late :(
Someone please tell me,  Why is the pig so CUTE
“Lyman shot the pig”
new vid yay!
the Pig part... WELL DONE XD
I live in Victoria soo.. yay fort Victoria!
Yes it's been months!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yay u posted
UPLOAD! YAY!
I was on live
Welp gotta prepare for war now
LETS GOO
Oh great this is a falklands war before the falklands islands were a thing yet
FINALLY OMG OVERSIMPLIFIED YESSS A NEW VIDEO
The return of king, seriously 38 minute video!?!, this going to be awesome
Got my chicken nuggets ready!!
As a Washingtonian I’m extremely surprised @Oversimplified covered this. And appreciate it very much
38:00 Canadians do have a better wellfare system and are completely diverse and totally Anti-Racist and theres less gun violence (unless your favorite hockey team loses). America is Racist, Sexist, and Xenophobic, and theres no word to describe the amount of discrimination, its almost the norm over here. Adn don't get me started on Gun Violence, this year, we faced 2 school shootings in 1 year and lots of riots and gun violence. Not to mention, American politics is insanely competitive, you can take a look at Joe Biden and Donald Trump as an example,. If we lose people like Canada, this world is doomed
AN OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO JUST DROPPED? WHERE IS MY POPCORNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
This video is a blessing, I’m waiting  for the bills patriots game, this video is perfect to waste time
33:28 that actually felt relieving
"America Won World War I": Canada: *Nothing* "America Won World War II": Canada: *Nothing* "America Won The War of 1812": Canada: "YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH"
Troops instantly freeze if they take a step north of the border and our elite beavers will finish the survivors on the spot!
Wow it’s really been half a year since he last uploaded, glad your back man
OMG HE POSTED :DDDDD
USA USA USA
THE KING HAS RETURNED!!!!
What country blocked the Hitler video? It's available here in Canada
Oversimplified makes his sponsors so good that we don't even skip them
Thanks man!
Finally
What
I thought he died
That ending might have been the best thing I have ever seen
The last time I was this early Zanzibar was still at war.
Like for those who waited this long for this spectacular video!
YOOOO AN UPLOAD
Ooh what a way to wake up and see a new Oversimplified vid!
a new video :eyes:
Make something about 30 years' war
Well that escalted relativly quckly
I was not expecting this
Me watching the entire video before his speech: "God did I miss this guy"  Me hearing his whole speech about the US invading Canada, Drake being president, stateing legitament facts throughout those 2 mins and addressing the Canada exclusivity: "JESUS CHRIST LMAO"   Hearing him talk with his patrioticly scary VOICE and the outro playing at the very end of his speech while watching and reacting to the entire live chat laugh their asses off and chanting: *" OH MAN THIS GUY A TREASURE"* 🤣😭
“Biden’s coming” is the worst threat of all time
hi
Do the Vietnam war next.
That ending tho
Hiiiiiii
Christmas came early
RIP Canada
Well i know who’s getting late for work today
Bruh the animation is so clean no wonder it took long
"Where Gretzky could wave the American flag every 4th of July"  Finnaly, Crosby's goal in the 2010 Olympics wont count! GOLD IS OURS!!
...What was with the starting bit?  Jesus christ, that was dumb.
Griffin pig looks like Waddles!
This video was amazing,  I loved every second of it
These are probably the funniest jokes ever! I love you oversimplified!
As  a Canadaian… I LOVE THIS!!!!!!
I live next to fort Vancouver and volunteer there sometimes and let me say it is a really cool place
I read this title and literally thought that pigs would have grenades! LOL!
3:35 That’s eerily familiar to the divine right to rule of absolute monarchy(either way, it’s a nice touch that you used the same effect).
I  cant believe that when an American raged he used a AK 47 instead of a beautiful american M249 light machine gun
Obviously the end of this is AMAZINGGG
USA USA USA U!S!AAAAAAAAA
Omg
Ending was good but Biden comment killed it
That ending was INTENSE, I love it
I thought he was doing the thing after november but he was acutually making a video for us
YOOOOOOO
I don’t now but manifest destiny part 2 sounds pretty cool
Pig war
honestly america should annex canada.   and before you ask, i am an american, with a canadian parent
Oh boi! Oh boi!!! A NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED EPISODE WOOOOO!!!
quick @technoblade
Bean
yey
Ancient civilizations oversimplified perhaps?
I swear, this guy is the definition of quality over quantity.
i’ve been waiting for a new video
God loves You.
glad to see that vancouver actually exists. I was starting to think the city I live in was irrelevant to films and shows
5:45 😂😂😂😂
canada's curves tho
I'll do you one better. How about WE invade you instead so you can have free healthcare? Plus, you'll finally do the world a favor and ditch the imperial system. Long live Canada!!! Long live Justin Trudeau!!! 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Bro I just creamed o little when I saw that he posted
Epic
He posted

I felt it in my bones he would post this week
This was your best video so far edit: nvm im canadian
One word YES
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!!!!!
Early!!
This makes me happy
ah yes, nordvpn hair to start off my evening
As an American I am very offended by this scene right here, 15:55 an American would not pull an AK-47 from NOWHERE at the slightest displeasure, An American would pull a M4A1 from no where at the slightest displeasure.
Best vid ever
HE RETURNS!!!!!!

When are you going to do the Vietnam war????
New Oversimplified!!! Yes!!!

Me, a Canadian: yeah right 💀
Thank you OverSimplified for this Christmas gift!!
After 6 freaking months  Well, at least we're satisfied it was definitely his funniest video😂
mom wake up Oversimplified posted
Is it just me, or did it seem like the American pawns in the video keeps being the one to start fights?
The Master is back!
when oversimplified posts me: lessss gooooooooooooo finally my sister: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED
Maybe The Isreal-Palestine Disbute or the cyprus disbute?
Invade Canada!  omg lol I almost died.  Jim Carrey, Ryan Reynolds, Justin Bieber, Mike Myers, and the amazing Celine Dion would be American 🇺🇸 I’m down

I remember being on a wiki link click binge and came across this. I was so fascinated by how close it was to the U.S. going to war with “Canada”; almost on Cuban missed crisis levels.. then I found out the U.S. did kinda have a standoff with Canada where one person died over a chicken coop I think
That ending was shocking! I feel like Oversimplified are gonna become their own government and take over Canada themselves
I'm just gonna insta like rn
All the wars have finally got to him He's gone crazy
Are you sure Canada isn't slowly assimilation America?  I mean, a lot of our celebrities are Canadian, alot of our movies are being filmed in Canada, and Canadians knows more about America than Americans know about Canada.
*talks a bout pig war  Me who lives in Washington state😀😀😀
Ahaha I was right, it was that time of season again
Yoooo after idk a year now?
9:19 is when the portable lock ain't workin.
CHRISTMAS IS HERE EARLY
Straight line?
This has the most cringeworthy scenes so far
What is the next video possibly about?
These are the only videos on YouTube that I will make sure to put on TV and watch like a movie.  Love it!
FINALLY, AN UPLOAD!! :D
Damn, late again.
Maybe next time (Yugo)slavia war? 🤔
Nice thumbnail
Finally
“Being Americans, they pulled guns on him” This is why this channel is great.
Your back i thought you were dead
You’ve heard of the Great Emu War now get ready for the sequel the Pig War
You're back
my dumbass was like "dear god, not another dsmp video in my recommendations"
Well, I had a feeling that I would die by the hands of OverSimplified…
made my day. Sincerely, thank you
Finally!!
So that one episode of Hey Arnold actually was based on actual possible war? Well I be damned.
The quality in these videos are getting better with each one.
The end made me cry
31:00 that dude just racked a muzzle-loader.
Aw yay!!! Christmas really did come early 🙏
but when the world needed him most, he came back
Medieval europe when?
As a Canadian I find the ending quite funny
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
is it just me or does picket look like a splitting image  of ian from ForgotenWeapons?
This is so gold lol the best video yet especially at the end, he has our humor!!!
It’s a Christmas miracle
The legend returns...
"What has borders given us?" - Solo Wing Pixy
I don't feel ok'eh
it all circles back to Canada!
Homie post some more stuff
Yes, yes, ANOTHER ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14:05 had me laughing 😂
OverSimplified should remake World War I.
NEWWW VIDEOoOO
Oversimplified is the only man who can make history even more fun
As an American, I'm glad OverSimplified included pieces on Native American lands and how they were forced out. It was a borderline genocide, and many states and cities in the USA have manipulated their school curriculums to scrub clean their role in the bloodshed. It's a bad part of our history, but its our history nonetheless.
Babe wake up OverSimplified posted
The wait is over!!!
Finally after 6 months
WOOO HE BAC
I would love a 3 part series on rome
Low key that ending sounds like it would be awesome in reality
Lol, this video was made by him while being drunk. I love it
That ending was... interesting to say the least.
All hail the return of the king!
Could you please talk about the south american independency campaign?It would be very interesting
10\10 vid YAY
I’m here early.
Insta-like. Gonna watch later. Ringing the bell for this dude. The first and only bell I've rang on Youtube.
turning 21 and getting an oversimplified video let’s fucking gooooooooooooo
I’m concerned that you can say Biden is coming with a vengeance “this time”. How old is he?
This is such a good video! I hope we can someday get a entire series of Oversimplified content. I don't care if I need to pay for it. I'M GOING TO WATCH THEM ALL!
FINALLY A VIDEO
LET GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I just started watching it right now
I think we can all agree that the Americans were at fault.
The thumbnail gives me an idea, how about Star War simplified?
Funny!🤣
Hi
I'm moving away from Canada. See you later fellow Canadians. I'm out of here!
A Napolean pin got me compliments from 3 different women. Thanks oversimplified!
we all rejoice when Oversimplified posts!!
One of the higest cuality yt chanels without a doubt.
The man, the lord himself, has returned!! Let's see what his genius can do to help us all remember The Pig War!
Fucking finally
YASSSSSS
Long live America😛😛
Pig
OH MY GOD OH MY OK EVERYONE OKK EVERYONE IT'S HAPPENING OK EVERYONE STAY CALM STAY FUCKING CALM
Where I live would have been split if amarica got all of Organ teratory
Is-Is this- Oversimplified posting?! It’s a miracle!!
Alrighty lads, time to Manifest some Destiny!
What ? Dude its a stupid pig kill them and eat on Christmas(Happy cristhmas)

What about making a video in India please sire
He is back!
Yesss a new upload!!
Vietnam war when
I'm not even Canadian but I think I pissed my pants a little at the end
I am gonna go to sleep happy tonight
hi
USA
Ah yes, what could go wrong invading Canada?? Seems absolutely, totally worth it! 🤩🤩🤩
I will never get how the war of 1812 was a draw. Getting your capital burnt to the ground is usually the thing that happens when you loose right?
I loved the poor person joke!
“I hear voices all the time” lol
Ah yes, OverSimplified.
FINALLY HES BACK
But Justin Bieber would be American
This is why I don’t like america
So what you're telling me is that those in power were... Pig-headed
1:18 OHHHHHH
just came back to youtube after 60 hours and boom
alright see you next year
Ok
The ending is the most american thing I see in my life. America will only attack for Oil.
Yes finally new vid
Thanks for mentioning canada lol
let’s gooooooooooo
Can you do The vitenam war :))))).
I'm so happy I subbed to this channel.
@oversimplified finally!!
Oh my God, he is back
Things I like about this video:  1. It’s oversimplified  2. It’s an obscure war I’ve never heard about 3. 30+ minutes long
HOLY SHIT! OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOAD! Great content like always.
its been forever
Certified Hood Classic right here
Second best video by far!!!!! Keep em coming.🤙
Wtf is that ending, I love it
At this rate,humanity could fight over air soon
omg he uploded WHOOOOO\
Oversimplified is the best history channel in history
ppl are weird we do we almost/go to war OVER A FRICKIN PIG!!!
I wonder how different American history would be if we went to war over a dead pig in the 1850s.. the Confederacy probably would have won, since the military would've been likely either depleted from fighting the British or would be fighting two enemies at once
Yyeessssss
10:24 as an English person i can confirm this is a 100% accurate portrayal of our parliament
Anyone else realize that Florida looks like America’s junk the way he draws it?
This the first time he's uploaded in half a year
Skyblock     I know you get the reference
I’m only 1 hour late, let’s go
Mildly early today!
Damn 60,000 people watched it live. It’s a bigger audience than some tv shows
Here I am 🙋🏻‍♀️ From 🇨🇦
An OverSimplified upload, IMPOSSIBLE
America moment
Can you do the Texas Revolution?
Woooooooooo yay baby that’s what it’s all about wowowowoooooo
Every day that Oversimplified posts is a good day.
Nice
Yeeeeeeesssssss oversimplified finally uploaded another video and I was tired of watching the napoleonic wars.
I've been waiting forever for a new video from you. Love u. 💜💙
Epic
It is beautiful
My daddy after drinking angry juice all day and coming home 33:29
What's upsetting is this dumb idiot (Joe Biden) may actually want to go to war with Russia because his feelings are hurt who wants to go  piss off Putin just So he could feel like a real man
I’m just going to say It  I think the war looked different  There is no way that they were stickmen
(Checks watch)  “Yeah, we’ve got about 2 hours till this hits #1 on the trending page…”
LETS FUCKIN GGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We all missed you! Your videos are amazingly overkill, especially this one. Just don't run for office in the near future
Finally another video
One of the first 3.5k comments.  Momma would be proud
Or what if Canada invaded the US hmm?
Was your Vietnam oversimplified video blocked here in the USA?
Yay
Canadians rn :🤬🤬🤬
Wowowwo
Best. Shit. Ever.
Yeah let's go Washington state!!!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
I love how all the Americans in this and many other videos of yours are always gun carrying crazies. As an American this is a portrayal I don’t mind and in fact enjoy. Born in Louisiana then raised in Arkansas I don’t think I’ve even known someone who didn’t have a gun.
God I love this channel
Christmas is early this year🥳🥳🥳
Finally another video
Spanish Civil War
THE RETURN OF THE KING
This happened in my state! We visited the English and American camps in the San Juan’s it was really cool and informational. I recommend anyone living in or visiting Washington check it out
OverSimplified sounding MANLY AS FUCK
uwu
I dunno but something seems off in this video. It's like smoother I think and a new microphone.
yay napoleon made a cameo
Me: *sees over simplified uploaded new video* Also me: clicking has been set to automatic
YASSSSSS!!! IT'S TIME TO INVADE CANADA!!!!!!!
just when I thought I was out, OverSimplified pulls me back in!
“Well, that would be a completely fair compromise that protects the interests of both parties. . . AND THERE’S NO WAY I’M GONNA AGREE TO IT!” 	American foreign economic policy in a nutshell.😎
U.S was very mean :), That island should of been U.K
nice to have this during apush
YYYEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Young Oversimplified: I want to be the indian guy on youtube Mom: ha! You aren't Indian  Young OS: dude... uncool... **becomes indian guy on youtube anyway**

NOOO I WANT THAT PLUSHIE SO BAD
YOOOO HE UPLOADED
I'm waiting for the subtitles in spanish for More videos...

Babe…wake up Oversimplified uploaded
do a video on Julius Ceasar i think it would be cool
That ending tho
All I wanted for Christmas this year was an oversimplified video…  SANTA IS REAL BOYS!!!
Claim your "here within an hour" ticket here!
OverSimplifed, if you see this do the war of 1812 (That's more detailed), that'd be really cool.
HE'S BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!! after 6 months
The first, last, and only time people wanted to live in Oregon
FINALLY!
12:00 THATS A FUNNY NUMBER OF SHEEP
What a dramatic ending for the Canadians. This has been the best oversimplified video I have seen so far.
As a Canadian, that ending was so fucking hilarious
In 20 years, people will think that going to war over a pig would be justified. Just because in 2028 the US invaded Canada over a youtube video
So the Amricans has invaded my contry TWICE...
HES FINALLY BACK! YES!
PIG also CONTENT
Epic clash 1:24
*I HAVE TO STOP NUTING BUT I CANT*

OverSimp
37:11 *Fallout noises*
Yessssss NEW UPLOAD!,,,,,!,!!!
That ending oversimplified: 🇺🇸
4:02 as if any native tribe wouldn't try to do the same. The natives lost to the superior forces and have been batching about it ever since
Let’s say the ending is unexpected
Welcome!
13:29 the most eloquently and civil way two opposing parties have ever argued!
Love the animation in this one
Hell yeah, history at 4 am LESGO
The Return of the King 👑
I think oversimplified has gone insane in the last part...
56 minutes ago = completely random commemt

YEA BABY
Yay!
Well I've unsubscribed
*Looks at the title*  Me: *"WHEN IS THE VIETNAM WAR COMING!!!!!"* ... Whatever, let's just enjoy this work of art.
8 mins in and I had to pause, this guys storytelling ability matched with the jokes make this so so so entertaining. Love oversimplified.
Nice
The pig looks like the pig in Gravity Falls... Nice
W
5:55
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
Amazing
For those wondering, the March at 7:30 is called national emblem March.
Among us is sus.
This makes me excited for Victoria 3
I love that slow transition when Oversimplified is like "We have the manpower..." with the quiet Star-Spangled Banner playing
Boys he’s back
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The legend uploaded
56 mins shoulda clicked when I first saw
Lets gooooo let's Annex Canada elected in the fallout universe it would be sooooo easy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
8:23 look at Florida ;)
Bagèl!
I still would like The Vietnam War
what was that end part
dang oversimplified, even though you don't upload often, i would rather have longer upload times. Everything you pump out a new video, it brings me joy. Been a viewer since you uploaded (I think) the first mini wars video. Can't wait to see more, even if you don't see this!
Was walking and I saw this!
Is your throat okay? If it isn’t just take your time. We can wait
As a canadian I love to see some spotlight spread on to the war of 1812
What the hell was that ending :D Love you man
Woooooooooooooooo!!!!!
Whoa whoa whoa he is back
That ending sure was something huh
Let's gooo! Another Oversimplified video!!
The Pig War is the last thing I thought OverSimplified would cover after 6 months, but honestly, I don't think we would have wanted anything else
this is radd ive been waiting for this for a min now
Canada time said by a true Canadian
Oversimplified can you make a ancient Egypt video
Y fight for motherland when u can for pigz??
*The year is 2027971:* American troops teleport into the Canadian School for E-Girls in an attempt to take back their prized prototype RTX-Tesla Gaming Computer. The brave team of Tumblr haired Pepe drones scout the area before beginning extraction. Suddenly, BOOM! The wall bursts open, and out comes Canadas Experimental super soldier, Wolverine-Man, the super Hockey Player, bursting into the room in a storm of glory. Using his Uranium powered Hockey Puck, sponsored by Vermont Maple Syrup, he sends the yankees flying away like a the bullet out of the American’s latest firearm, the Alienware M4A1. Suddenly, bursting out of the other wall, Wolverine-Man’s arch rival: Captain Zuckerberg marches in brandishing his very own Microsoft Brand M16. All this and more, here on Moose Puck Z Kai.
I swear, NordVPN or Honey needs to pay this man more so we can HAVE MORE VIDEOS!
Can you make your videos in clean edition pls
I loved the pure hatred of Canada. The most emotion oversimplified ever put into a video was expressing his desire to invade Canada.
NEW VIDEO YEAAAAAAHHHH
GUYS DAD CAME BACK WITH THE MILK and a pig?
...did he write the last part drunk?
Someone: Excuse me sir, it seems there are people already living out west.  The US: Oh no! Anyway.
I love how the manifest destiny scenes all include the construction of a McDonald’s
1:22 OH DAMN
Flaklands war
Canadian's:....NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Weird enough I just went to check OverSimplified's channel because he hadn't uploaded in a while, and now I see a new video just came out.
7:58 Dawg you can keep going
Check out the Nord VPN ad. Oversimplified knew that we were all expecting the Vietnam war, but he gave us this anyway after over half a year... goddamnit, I hope Vietnam war is next, I've literally opted out off watching any videos on it to ensure I get it all from oversimplified
is it christmas time already, this is too early for a present 😃
Haaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!
I missed you so much
HE HAS RETURNED! WITH THE GREATEST CONTENT IMAGINABLE!
BIDEN'S COMING BABY AND HE'S PACKING HEAT
Oversimplify be wilding at the end 😂😂37:08
We need an episode or two on the Mexican-American War or the War of 1812
You don't talk enough about Mexico!
Yay New video!!!
HELL YA NEW OVERSIMPLIFIED DROP. HYPEEE
Babe wake up oversimplified posted
10:19  ahem ahem *falkland islands*
Holy mother of god he really went a bizillion percent on this one 😭😭😭
❤️
Quality over quantity
Does anyone get the feeling that oversimplified is connecting all of he,she,or it’s videos in historical order….for example this video the pig wars connects with the revolutionary war and the civil war….and the napoleonic wars connects with the French revolution as well as the American revolution and Etc. etc. and YouTube
Yeah watch out canada
Your vids are amazing
At the end all I could here in my head was “USA USA USA”
3,238th
I think the ending tramatized me for life being Canadian
Now it's a Christmas
The amount of (joking) bitterness at the end though
yea
FINALLY, HE'S BACC
Aye another video
0:40 Best comedic moment of the video! I'm dying of laughter. 😂
Almost a year later, this was absolutely worth it.
God damn that Ending
Can you do t series Vs pewdiepie next?
3:38 "It's my DENSITY"
Please do vietnam
I love how oversimplified is becoming progressively more insane with each video.
“But the Americans keep coming and they don’t stop coming, hopped in their wagons and they hit the ground running”  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Asia eu antanica africa and black people: white people
N O R D V P N

OVERSIMPLIFIED UPLOAD LESSSSSGO
What tooked you so long:/
When the world needed him most…
Let's fucking gooooo!! I be checking your page every six months like a crackhead carpet surfing!
Yay! The Pig War. I was hoping you'd do a video on it. Love the San Juan Islands. Thank you! 🤗🖖💕
Amazing
“an unrelenting negative outlook on life that affects everyone around me.” As someone who is British all I can say is oof but it’s the truth 🤣😌
When the world needed him the most, He returned.
FINALLY!!!!!!!
Your best video yet!
I love oversi,plifed
Lmao yes we need even more Canada content
The legend has returned.
Please oversimplified, I have a test next week about Alexander the Great. Please help me out.
amazing as always
damn it im late :( but nice video :)
It's like a Christmas miracle
Anglo-Zanzibar war next, please! That or the Franco-Prussian war.
we can all agree the ending was the best part
Your back yes
Wow a new vid
YASS NEW CONTENT!!
finally he uploads
He has returned
Make video about Yugoslav Civil War
0:53: reference to  Star Wars
usa usa 🇺🇸
This really left me asking, what did I just watch
I really hope this man doesn’t live with anyone that can hear him   That last part would have made me question his sanity lmao
Mannnn, they rlly went ham on eachother.
The Emu Wars younger, less known brother
I don’t feel safe as a Canadian after the end
finally hes back
I shall consume
Finaly You Upload And Can The Plushie Be Delivered In The Philippines ?
Straight line?  ......reply
this is great since im studying the pig war
HES BACK
I think the belief in manifest destiny came mainly from the fact that we actually managed to win the revolution.  And I think it was about reaching sea to sea, not owning the whole continent. But seems like something Biden would do if somebody put a pen and paper in his hand right after he wakes up.
Quite the tangent at the end
53 minuts and 28k likes... nice.
bacon
That ending though
YEESSSSSSS  FINALLY A KUNG HAS RETURNED
Love your video
Wake up babe, OverSimplified just uploaded.
yes
early af
AYEEEEE
I feel like every time i come back to this channel to see if a new video has came out a new one appears 2-3 days later.
POV your waiting for Vietnam war  uuuuuuugggggg
This is really well made
Oversimplified subenuevo vídeo Los memeros: A trabajar
This is hands down one of or THE funniest video Oversimplified has made.
oversimplified wouldn't upload for six months so his father punished him  severely
yo
This video was amazing thanks
absolutely pog
I must say I fully support US occupying Canada. That'd take all the attention and then we can get our Alaska back! There is so much oil and gold there that Putin could afford a new billion dollar mansion (he does have one in Gelenzhik) that's even bigger. Minimum wage would still be $100/mo though
Personally I blame Canada
there were white people out west though lmao, i guess even oversimplified has fallen to liberalism
Oversimplified uploads Me: a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
The one time Canada is mentioned....
Amazing thumbnail!
FINALLY YES A NEW VID LETS GOOOO
I think the best part is 10:32
Wait berkshire pigs looks similiar to the pig in Gravity Falls
1800 governments: A strait line is not only the fastest way from point A to point B, but also the best way to solve a border issue.
Woooooo yeah baby ! This is what i been waiting for this is what it's all about
Ladies and gentlemen , he is alive !!!!!!!
Can you do a video of the Transcontinental railroad
Can you please do the Vietnam war ? ( btw love your videos )
Jesus OverS ! I thought u were hurt !
That ending tho
Another banger.
pebis
I saw. I came.
Hooray another episode!
It's always the American wanting more and more. Typical capitalist (not in any offensive way, just the way it's xd).
This is the greatest video yet
Wait…so Hey Arnold was accurate???
This is by far the best video to ever be uploaded on Youtube
Ah Yes... another masterpiece.
NEW EPISODEEEEE
Question: does the plushie also tell you everythings alright while cuddling?
The end was just beautiful
finally a new video
Yay he posted
I wouldn't mind a bigger America     But do we really want French Canada ?
JOE BIDEN IS COMING BABY!
The return of the king
Pig physics
Damn! Really stepping it up. This is awesome.
USA USA USA USA. 🇺🇸
That last part was the 3rd stupidest thing I've ever watched, and I loved it
I pray America liberates is from Trudeau
I literally checked on the channel yesterday to see if you guys made a new video.
Nordvpn must love this man
This is genuinely one of the funniest videos I've seen in a long while. OverSimplified keeps getting better in every way with each upload.
Pig war
great video
America 🇺🇸 is
Holy shit that mic.
NEW VID LEZZ GOOOO

Straight Line, Straight Line and here he is! but clearly yall i didnt know that they had B-2 stealth bombers in 1859  wow
America First 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
And with 1 video, Non-Canadians' knowledge of Canadian history increased by about 100%
YAAAAAAAAH BABY THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Holy cow, I just decided to rewatch OverSimplified today, and he reuploads? Amazing
Just when we needed him most,         He   R E T U R N E D
It was a historic moment seeing the live chat spam “USA” at the ending.
Hope we get a video on Theodore Roosevelt
Looks like you found your password...
Oversimplified: perhaps we can still invade Canada and we can do it Every Canadian watching this video: (chuckles) I’m in danger
Finally
Man these ad segways get crazier every time
I hated the beginning but the overall video was great
Here with in an hour
no one disliked yet 0-=
Props to the “I hear voices all the time” dude at 3:54. Same lol😂😂😂 Also I love the Star Wars themed poster. Obi wan would approve…
Why does a war about a pig and some potatoes sound vaguely familiar?
Great video!
Where’s Vietnam/Korea war?
FINALLY i love your content plz post more
Finally you upload
Happy
I forgot to sub then I missed the premiere-
3:40 skaven be like
Yes
This episode was hilarious. I especially liked the ending; the ending was one of the funniest things I've ever heard in one of your videos. Keep up the good work.
They laughed at Biden in America, now let’s make it all Biden’s America.
I was watching the Napoleonic wars when this was released
Christmas is early this year.
Yes!
I just called 5 people to tell them there's a new oversimplified and now I'm gonna watch it. You rock!!!
Charlie Hopkinson- Voice of the pig
i love oversimplified’s passive-aggressive remarks about his hitler video getting blocked
Not gonna lie... Wasn't quite expecting that ending but... Cool.
I’d love to see a full video on the wars between Native Americans and white settler, I learned about it in history and it briefly touched on in this vid but I still think it’s an interesting topic and also not talked about enough.
Pig moment
pig wars the final hog
If someone really want to request a video about there country history to oversimplified I swear he will come to your house in a second just to slapped you so hard until you hit a wall
I love this!
Can you make a paraguayan war video?
Opened YouTube and when I saw this video I ran down stair to tell my family
HOLY MOLY HES BACK!!!!
Next video Philippine revolution 1896 to 1898
HE IS BACK
The only thing more unexpected than this video is the Spanish Inquisition because, as is common knowledge, *nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition*
Yes new video!!!
We need more videos plz
*Canadian gang represent!*
Do a video about Brasil and paraguay war
I live in the San juans and I'm so sorry other people have to know about the pig war
How long does it take you to typically make a video?
Oink
SUPER GOOOOOOD
I was actually wondering today when is he going to post a new video lol
“This commentary is sponsored by pig VPN”
finally a new video!

you better watch your backs you canadians, you did absolutely nothing!
POV: the pig war in clash royale  HOG RIDEEEER!!!!

You should do videos on the war of 1812
Fun fact: The is an ongoing law in America that states if Canada ever asks to join the U.S. they are obligated to accept.
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one" - Me when I saw this in my subscriptions

Claim your ticket for being early to the video here!
When Oversimplified uploaded, Napoleon is definately average height for the time.
You loved the first few: the emu war, and: the football war. NOW PRESENTING: THE PIG WAR!
I love how people call European explorers "immigrants" to justify modern immigration while at the same time demonizing those immigrants. Really says a lot about modern society's hipocrisy
I was having an awful day, now is much better
POV : OverSimplified upload a new video   Me : Chaaaaaarge !
lol "Earl of Jizzingham" :-P
Great video, good on including Canada.

Looks like Christmas came early
Oh cool! A wild OverSimplified video has appeared!
Okay guys, next uploads gonna be a two parter. Im still hoping for the Vietnam War.
Scott is my favorite
pog
Honestly as a Canadian I wouldn't mind merging with the USA we could help revolutionise the healthcare system and you could finally start saying that your best hockey players come from "America." and totally not traded from Canada.😉
Awww, the plush looks like a snowman
OMG HE I+UPLOADED IDC WHAT IT IS HE UPLOADED
Bruh compare that ending to the first video he made for ww1.
​You may thing this is a joke but no this is a threat watch your back Canada
Hey babe, wake up. Oversimplified uploaded
We really should take over Canada 🇺🇸
*Epic*
Petition for Oversimplified to cover all of Manifest Destiny History and the Spanish American War and others,
HE CAME BACK!
1:19 Benjamin Franklin toast was funny XD
29:19 BUCHANAN!!!!!!!!!      *cries felt that

Dope

Yo i live on skull island in a small hut
Bruh I get so excited every time I see him in my sub box
“I’d worry less about Canada’s curves, and start worrying about yours.”
U
All the Canadians are terrified now.
Hi! Love your vids!
the legend has returned Great Video!
Its out! He finally uploaded!
Here in the first hour
The ending is so fucking funny
Now this does put a smile on my face
I love how Oversimplified introduces us to wars that most people have never heard of.
Newwwww video
At 2:57 there is map of Vietnam and other parts of southeastern Asia
Do Greece 1821 revolution
We missed you
Finaaly
The Man Is Back!
When the world needed him most he returned
LOL, Biden gets lost in the White House Rose Garden.
The return of the king
One of the rare channels where every video is gold
Oversimplified I thought you went all out but after that ending damn you freaky girl
U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A
Any evening is a good evening when you open YouTube and there's a new video from OverSimplified.
Christmas came early. Thanks Oversimplified!
where vietnam?
"You're an idiot, You're an idiot, You're an idiot, you guys are fine" 😂
I'm surprised he didn't mention that General Winfield Scott was also a Veteran of the War Of 1812, I know it's not all that important, but, I thought it was an interesting piece of information, in what almost became "The War Of 1812 Two: Pig Got Shot Boogaloo".
Waaaaddleeeeeees
DAY HAS BEEN MADE LETS FUCKINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG GO
Yay!!!!! New video!
Um... Is Oversimplified okay? I have never seen him talk so passionately about invading a country before.
It’s been 6 long montha
Man spent 6 months with one vid 😭
> 00:23 Before the pig > 18:35 Pig >  20:07 Military escalation
P I G
straight line
……is spuddy wearing sonic shoes?
40 min? we've been blessed
Holy shit that ending made me proud to be an American Im from New Zealand With Afghan heritage
Lest goooooo
This is ur funniest vid so far
That ending was the best thing I’ve ever watched
Thank you for this.
The governments of Britain and America freaking out  The Canadians: they shot me pig
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!
Another banger
As someone who lives next to Fort Vancouver, I find it funny because there are literally many islands right in the river as well and now the highway connects all of them
YES!! For the next 48 minutes and 42 seconds life is worth living Hooray!
HE'S BACK BOIS!!
Bidens coming baby
The war of 1812 was a British victory 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😎
Pig war? GIB PIG IM HUNGRY
Lol I’m from Canada btw
Oh my !
Noice video
Finally! Thank you for uploading.
I was just thinking about you
You thing this is crazy? Wait till the people on mars declare independence.
was legit talking to my cousin yesterday about how oversimplified hasn’t uploaded in a while
32:29
Pig wars: revenge of the men
I'm still waiting for the vietnam war video you promised in the cold war video
the american war
nice
With presentation like that, imagine what the Balkan wars would look like on a video, it'd be priceless
USA USA USA USA USA USA 🇺🇲🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲💕🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲💕🇺🇲
Christmas is here
I need someone to clip his rant about invading Canada please god
A Canadian POV:  Oversimplified going on at the end about a rant to take over Canada —No worries folks, he’s just going to make a joke now. Continues talking about manpower and nuclear weapons and a glorious united nation  —Aaannnyyy second now... MAPLE SYRUP WILL BE THE GREATEST AMERICAN *FOOD*. BE VERY AFRAID, BIDEN IS COMING!!!     *VIDEO ENDS.*   Haha. See, I told you! It’s funny because    *there is no joke.*
Very cool.
YES YOUR BACK ITS BEEN SO LONG HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
this video made my day, thanks OverSimplifed!
I wonder when is the spanish civil war video coming
omg omg omg A NEW VIDEO
I like how he made me feel like a United States: I feel like the u.s.a
hallelujah,hallelujah Over simplified did it again
Thanks for the early Christmas present
The legend FINALLY uploaded, this is gonna be a banger.
Cool
yooooooo
I love pigs
Best channel! ❤️
48 minutes since this was uploaded and already he has over 100k views. Hot damn this community is fast!
3:34 AMERICA HAS A D👍
I remember reading this from Washington State history textbooks. It really...It left an impact on my mind, reading about a conflict over islands landing into a tense situation that nearly landed the most powerful nation (Britain, of course, at the time)...Over a pig.  Which the Vancouver governor really wanted at the time too.
The king has returned
this will be a banger
no
i had to be in school when he uploaded
My fav moment 32:09
37:28  me who's Bri'ish: da f*** they doin' over there?
Ok, as someone who lives on one of those islands I must say this is great.
Let' s goooo!
goes to show that with war there is a good vs bad with idiots being the bad guys
That ending 😂😂😂 👏👏👏
Babe
I learn't about the westard expansion in my 4th grade class!
pictures of nicki minaj’s friend’s cousin 😭😭
A new video??? It’s a Christmas miracle
WELCOME BACK WE'VE MISSED YOUUU
His spotted WHAT
Wasn't a US invasion of Canada a major event leading up to the Fallout series? ANOTHER REASON TO TAKE IT OVER, I WANT MY POWER ARMOR BABY!!
finally
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My last unit in the army was 1-4INF which is the same unit that responded to the Pig War. Crazy to think that the same unit is still around and it's currently in Germany.
19:32 Longest cry and loudest in oversimplified history
Yes
What a great day, the best youtuber of all uploading another history video. I can already hear the " he was punished severely "
The best surprise of 2021
For a moment I thought this was a Star Wars episode
Claim your "in an hour" ticket.
O I N K
YIKES
Ah. He finally lost it.
USA USA USA USA
that ending was funny as im a canadian
27:26 saddest prediction i ever heard
Clicked on this video so fast, I’ve got arthritis in my left index finger
what the fu—
Merica Fuck Yeah
POG
4:00 - greatest 20 seconds of animation every made
I love that ending
7:56 Smash mouths reference xd
48 minutes best time I've gotten on one of his videos.
Now oversimplified we are going to war thanks a lot this comments is for the future
At the end when he stretched his voice out I was like is this the same person- No but great job OverSimplified, I'm getting myself a little present, your merch ;) Worth the wait ☺
Thank you for telling me about this amazing war
The only thing Joe Biden is coming for is the second scoop of ice cream.
Yes finally!
WE WANT OVERSIMPLIFIED VIETNAM WAR
HE'S BACK EVERYONE
Leave it to this guy to send a call to mobilize the boys to overtake our friendly northern brethren
last video of the year lets goo
i can already see this getting trending
@3:34 I love that Florida is the "dick" of the United States.  It's so fitting...
Only 47 minutes
ANOTHER GREAT OVERSIMPLIFIED VIDEO!!
Literally insane at making these videos
Funny that this idiot general called on Pickett, a future idiot General that would lose the pivotal battle of Gettysburg by sending his men full charge up what he thought was an undefended Hill side and got them shredded by union muskets.  Edit: I'm gonna start watching the full video before I comment, should have known he would have mentioned this.
I got a 6 pack from how hard that ending made me laugh😹💀
Please do the 7 years war.
4:09 mercia
FINALLY A NEW UPLOAD!!
YAY
I'm glad your back
Hes finally back
*OverSimplified uploads* Everyone: WOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAH BABY! THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT WOOO-
I swear to god the jokes about the sponsor gets funnier every time
I am confused. Canadians making jokes and laughing at that USA but at the same time  they support them in an argument against Europeans. Anyway I love both of them. Btw US doesn't need the cold vast territory of Canada except Joey Biden wants some gulags there.
FINALLY
😂😂😂🤣
ending kinda sad, im Canadian
when you realize its been 6 months since the last vid (hair turns gray)   pls dont take this as hate oversimp, take your time. You come first.
Did that dude just pump a musket?
HE’S BACK!!!
NEW VIDEO LETS GOOOOOO
Nice plushy
That ending should have been left out. There are enough humans who would take that seriously. WW3 is pretty much around the corner and we really don't need more things to speed that up.  As usual still a nice fun video.
as a canadian, i would like to say we have Ryan Reynolds so don't mess with us
So does that mean Canadian music would be American music? Nope, not worth it. It'll be a cold day in hell before I assume responsibility for BNL.
Sorry but I think other countrys would side with us Canadians. Would be the start to ww3. USA doesn't wanna be like Germany and Canada does not wanna be like you idiots down south of us. Seriously guys $70000000000 for meditation?
Finally new vid
I think Oversimplified dont like Canadians
Was not prepared for that ending
Man really explained manifest destiny
That last part was the best part of the vid and no one can convince me otherwise.
If we invade Canada, we will officially live in the Fallout Universe
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!! Finally we canadian exist in the oversimplified lore and are gonna become america's breakfast,if that's not recognising canada than i don't know what is.
YESSSS NEW VIDEO!!!
pogggg
Well I’ve watched all the other videos at least 20 times so this will be fun!
YOOOOO
Mexican American War next?????
HE UPLOADED!!!!!!!! YES
I’m a simple man, I see an oversimplified video I click
Finally!
finally my gift has arrived
had a test over this :(... today
It must be done, The US must invade Canada.
Average Emu War Fan vs Average Pig War Enjoyer
I’m a humble man I look at a new oversimplified video I click
“Straight Line?”     “Straight Line”
Love your content, really funny while staying accurate. keep up! Also the thumbnail reminds me of Revenge Of The Sith.
pogers
It's like you knew just what we wanted for christmas
Jesus is the way the truth and the LIFE. Come to him this is your sign!
I love how the tone of his voice is completely different for that finale
He makes a convincing closing argument
I am ready to run through a brick wall after that ending
He is back
I I WAS GONNA GO BED THEN THIS WAS PREMIREING LOL
4:10 very American
Canada has 230 nukes
Great vid oversimplified
This video is a flex of OverSimplified’s animation skill. Also, the invasion of Canada is as inevitable as that 6 mil sub.
It happened.
I love the subtle Florida penis loool
Yaaaaaaaaaay
No joke, the greatest ending ive ever seen to a video
I find it halarious that every 5 minutes I found myself out loud saying “MURICA!”
LETS GO
The ending surprised me
THE SUN NEVER SETS
Fun fact looking at the war of 1812 the Americans lost
Yes let’s gooooooo another oversimplified vid, just got off worm
Omg he’s back
Another great video by oversimplified
WHY DOES EVERY PIG LOOK LIKE WADDLES
Eh eh eh give plushie plz
After months of waiting. Finally!!! And I am getting a plushie too!
YeSSSSSSSS your back LOVE you guys!!!!!!!!!!
I always somehow think of oversimplified, and then they post
Certified Lover Boy Moment
Probably one of the most accurate representations of President Buchanan ever made... Lol
The end 😭
A story where the British (Douglas aside) did everything right for once.
He’s backkkkk
humans the only animal on earth to start a war over animals...2 TIMES BRO
BRITISH!!!! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
ive been waiting for too long lets gooo its finally out
This show is very specific...
Frick I better run
Has it been half a year already!?!
USAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSA
That ending was 10/10 we are gonna have some fallout stuff going on        Also      AAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!
U.S.A
USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA!!!!!!!! USA WILL TAKE OVER CANADA                                                                                                                                   jk
oversimplified best content on youtube
See you in another 6 months
HES ALIVE!
The ending was hype as fk. USA USA USA
Hudson’s Bay company still exists!
Finally another vid
Here before it is trending #1.
Though I think of the time that goes by with the effort of these videos, it is always worth when you see it.
best end ever
Man do I love this channel
Straight line? Straight line.
sus
Australia went to war against ostriches, it was HILARIOUS America: was it now?
YOO
finnaly you guys are back
You xant invade Canada, we don't exist, it's our whole thing
On June 3, 2072, the United States will officially annex Canada in response to a pipeline dispute.
Well….he finally talked about Canada lol
I literally went “Squeee!” When i saw this in the feed
RETURN OF THE KING
Well here’s to me rewatching this video 50 times before he upload his next video
As a Canadian, I highly doubt you Americans can even compete with our army of Canadian Geese and angry hockey fans
Amazing Video! Can you do the Vietnam War next?
this epic man produces the weirdest history videos
No one: Me when Oversimplified post SIUUUUUU
The ending just killed me🤣🤣🤣
Oversimplified: "The War of 1812 was pretty much a draw"  Canadians: *Furious typing noises*
HE POSTED YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Yeeeeeeee HAAAAAAAA 😂
Oversimplifed goes beserk talking about America invading Canada, 2021
Finally an upload,
That ending though
3:43 This is, without a doubt, the single most historically accurate depiction of Manifest Destiny that I have ever seen.
As a Canadian, I honestly found that end scene kinda funny
when’s the vietnam war coming?
When YouTube is so broken it days the premiere is still streaming
Did we just get All Star'd?
the legend has returned
*Super Cool :)*
"My Fellow Certified Lover Boys" oh nahh I can actually imagine Drake saying this😭😭
That was the greatest ending to anyone of your videos ever   God bless America 🇺🇸
my favorite part: 37:07
ALAS THE KING IS BACK
Yes he's back
Hi
THE GREATEST ENDING EVER
The amount of American stereotypes in this video is astounding. I’ve never felt so patriotic.
XD the ending killed me!
1:25 It is in fact historically accurate that Ben got fat shamed by the British in Paris
Finally! We thought you needed up like Adam O Nella
38:08 I'm not Canadian but I'm suddenly really scared
Wow that ending took a turn...
I was literally watching Oversimplified videos wondering when the next video was coming out and I saw the premiere moments later
oversimplified make a video on the black plauge
I was positive Oversimplified was going to do the War of 1812, when America fought Britain. I was half right
This is to accurate
US MOTHERFUCKING A
bruh this video was amazing
I've never seen Oversimplified yell like this  😂
The end is just 😙🤌
ey bois he is back
You heard it here first folks! The new manifest destiny!
did you finish reading "we stand on guard"
America:lets make the world better Meanwhile america:having a civil war
ha
the plushy looks cute and look like a snowman
Vietnam war next?🌚
That ending tho
Straight line- Straight line.
Me when the
I actually love this channel so much
Technoblade will love this
Just when you thought, people couldn't fight wars over anything stupider,        ...pigs
Yay Over simplify uploaded!
I need oversimplified to make every president at this point
Based
Cod wars should be next
The ending is legendary
Because of a pig in the 1800's, biden will invade canada
If trump saw this video in office, he would think invading Canada is a good idea.
yay
38:19 No one: Absolutly No one: *Biden* :
Please cover Indian history one day
I love the whole video is just him talking to himself.
Im early
Hello
*The king is back*
A new OverSimplified video... and on my birthday too?! All I need now is a pin from OS himself, and I'll be forever happy :)
10 years from now: how a YouTube video started the annexation of Canada - OverSimplified
People keep saying he left us, but he was always there in our hearts
cool
I smile whenever you upload
bruh.. agnry bird real!
Manifest Destiny. We should heed Oversimplified and take Canada 😂😂😂
They say Christmas comes early for good people   Now why is this here
Id had a feeling Charlie did that impression, that's awesome
I live in modern day Oregon and I love this video. This was amazing to learn. Thank you.
“IT’S MY DENSITY” do you mean destiny?
Third World War soon? Russia and Ukraine might make it happen soon…
Me a Canadian: o_o
Well… that was an ending 😂😂
I always watch each new video, thinking "There's no way it can be better than the last video, the last video was almost perfect." And then OverSimplified does it again.
Worth the Wait
He returned :))
This video makes me proud to be half British (by identity)
He is not dead
OverSimplified: *declares war on Canada to make a video on the Great Canadian War in 20 years*
Can we all take a moment to appreciate this is a 40 minute video on something that’s not even covered in AP US History.
R.I.P porky
“I didn’t say they were white people” *America 100*
USA! USA! USA! USA!
im joseph r biden, and i approve of this message
Its both really weird and cool to see how much the animation and humor have evolved over all these videos Like damn I swear some of the animations here look better than some in the Napoleonic Wars videos Very cool, guys!
oversimplified you really come in clutch with these vids :D thanks for the oversimplified videos
I thought you were dead
The legend is back.
ho ho ho
Im mexican and if canada dissapeirs  tell me ive got a plan
Looking forward to Biden invading Canada
“I promise I won’t get all political”  3 Beers later: 37:10
This is going to cause a brawl among Canadians and Americans Lmao
This is undoubtedly the best video on the channel. Technically, the U.S. wouldn't have go go too far to invade most of Canada. Most of their population is below Edmonton, which is only 350 miles from the 49th parallel.
Surely people would invade Mexico first since that would require more manpower
Da glorious yt channel of all time has returned!
oh canada so voluptous
Well Canadians, you asked to be mentioned. Hope you are happy.
You are the greatest
America forever
"You don't talk about Mexico enough." Some Mexican guy probably
The audacity claim to invade canada made me freakin laugh, oversimplified you're a madman
first 200k
Random US History Teacher: "I'm sure you guys have heard of all the great wars in US History, WW1, WW2..." Me: Oink
I guess the USA always was this way...
THEYRE BACK
POV: You're a canadian 38:12
"Lyman, I'f you spare my life, I'll grant you 3 wi--" *Musket Shot*
German Empire supported us and we betrayed that trust! Are... we the baddies?
And when everyone needed him, he came back. JUST ON TIME WITH MY HISTORY EXAN
I like how his longest videos is about a war about a pig.
Okay but like...                       are we stopping at Canada?
62K people watch your premiere. Holy poop.
AT LAST!
Straight line yea straight line
The lord has returned
Les go
Are Lord has Returned
Ha, try to get me in nwt
Good, I live Germany, wait...still banned :(
Nice
I just love how at the end oversimplified just goes on a rant threatening to invade Canada
As a Canadian, 37:09 is a genuine fear I think most of our “measly” population has.
Brah best ending ever bro also if America did invade Canada and conquered it then we’ll ww3 but everyone and I mean literally everyone against America but if it’s “agreed” by both countries for America to engulf Canada then ppl might just be shocked and piss off ig Canadians for sure pissed to and extreme but other than that nothing we’ll see u in 8-10min the with a new video with me watching it
Lmao the end of this lovely, how his voice changed in that segment was hilarious
That pig deserves justice. Rest in peace.
LETSSS GOOOOO
Hey OVERSIMPLIFIED
Ok
LETS GO
The last thing I expected was that ending
What the f did I just watch
This video by itself is longer than both WW2 videos combined
You went pretty insane at the end there, huh?
28:59 James Buchanan was a bit of a wimp but  hey take at easy on Americans first Gay president. Oh yeah you herd me correctly
Christmas just came early boys
Ok bubby, I think Manifest Destiny has literally "hogged" your brain.
Boy, that COVID isolation hits pretty hard huh oversimplified?   Lol great video as always!
When will the Vietnam War come out?
ngl ben got roasted hard
Amazing as always
America got a dump truck after manifest destiny
we have waited for centuries for another story by you my lord
It’s a great day when oversimplified uploads a new video
Great video as always, in each video giving more information with more personality 10/10
Me:  studying for exams. Oversimplified:  new video in two minutes. Me: stop what you're doing, put down all your work, and watch.
And at the end this is how oversimplified sparked the canado-american war 162 years later-
I was watching the Napoleonic wars episode hoping another would come soon and would you look at that
Finally
We have had the war of the Bucket, the Pig war, now we just need the Dog War/Stray Dog Incident to complete the trilogy.
Finally
It would be amazing if you do the Barbary wars next
WTF was that ending.
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
he has RISEN
Most Sharks don't attend church
Oversimplified has officially came out against Canadians..
Nothing says more about human conflict especially the American one than two countries going to war over a pig.
Aussies: First Time?
Great video
Respectfully, WTF IS THAT LAST SKIT, ARE YOU OKAY MAN?!
Australia: declares war with emus  United States: almost declares war because of a pig
You have made my holidays so much better! Thank you! My husband and I love your videos!
See you guys in the next 6 months with a Korean War video
THE SEQUEL; DRAKE EATS CANDIAN PORK AND JOINS WITH BIDEN WITH NUCLEAR WARHEADS TO UNLEASH A NEW WEAPON AND CONQUER CANADA. BUT CAN THE MOUNTIES STOP THEM AND CAN THE PIG RETURN TO IT'S RIGHTFUL PLACE ON THE San Juan ISLES, FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON PIG WARS!
Claim your within 1 hour ticket here
This was the most unhinged Oversimplified I've ever seen, this was fantastic
yay
thanks for doing that, if that happens I can go and see snow   (From florida)
37:21 AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER
Honestly, he improved his speaking skills a lot. His skills were always good but I can see a huge improvement in this video
Bro the ending was perfect
Lol it says it’s my density
I’m almost sure he was drunk when he made this, so we need to get him more booze
CANNADA CANNADA CANNADA
Good lord that ending had me crying laughing
Damn, that final bit had gusto. Didn't know you had it in you
The ending was the most patriotic thing i have ever seen
You acted like Biden declaring war on Canada was a joke but I wouldn't be surprised if in his incoherent ramblings he accidentally declared war on Canada.
MERICA
Thank you for the early Christmas present Oversimplified!! You always give us what we want😁.
Canada is feeling very threatened
Man I learned so much from this channel
Mhm, Murican Canada
You do realize that the last time your precious USA tried to invade Canada we burnt your white house to the ground. Come at us. See what happens.
1:20 roast sessions
“You should worry less about Canada’s curves and more about your’s Franklin”
Anyone else look at the title before clicking on it and thinking "what the hell am I getting into?" Also... yay, another oversimplified!
No. How about lets not invade Canada
Oh the great man has given us a great novel again!
YOOOOOO I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
That end was too manifest destiny
ITS ABOUT TIME.
Lyman: “I kind of just killed your pig.”  Griffin: “you SWINE!”  Lyman: no I killed the swine, I’m Lyman.  Griffin: *AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH*  *begins a fight
YES FINALLY
Seven Years War next please
I’ve been waiting lets goo
that was possibly the best ending to a youtube video that i have ever seen in my entire life
Oh the final 2 minutes is now my favorite Oversimplified moment
I like how this has been out for like a hour and has over 100k views
God has blessed us with a 30+ minutes long video from arguably the best educative content creator
Yes yes yes yes ues
Canada, Canada would be the one to enrage OS. Ironic anyone?
That ending has to be the most chaotic ending Oversimplified has done yet. I love it!
me : make a vid about Tunisia next please :D  Americans : what's tunisia??  is this something you eat??  xD
Yes          He’s back
A masterpiece with an epic ending befitting this great channel
NEW VIDEO LET'S GOO!
WE’RE COMIN’ CANADA
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND IS BACK!
That ending tho
kinda mid ngl
As a Canadian thank you, but also we are superior to America in every way possible love you guys 😘😘😘
Americans deciding their Western Borders: 1:54
0:47 Should I unsubscribe?
the ending had me dying-
WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE!
0:53 best Star wars movie yet
What the fuck did I just watch
Man really made a 40 min video about a pig war and I watched every minute of it
That ending tho lmao
The legend is back
At last
I seriously recommend you don't invade Canada.
🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲All hail to emperor biden!🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
glorius
22:00 Some of you may die, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to pay
They should never stop making vids. Great Channel!!! PLEASE BRING BACK THE NAPOLEON PIN PLLLEEAAASSSSEE!!!
Straight line? Straight line.
WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH ANOTHER AMAZING VIDEO.  HAZAH
Hey Oversimplified, why don't you do a video on the 1848 revolution in Hungary? :) (Y)
I literally was just scrolling and thought this was a joke!! I’m sooo excited! 😭☺️
Was gonna spend tonight reading the book I have to write an essay on, but than I saw oversimplified uploaded.
Canada should absolutely be afraid of Biden man Have they seen what he did to Afghanistan?!
f in the chat for spuddy
AS A CANADIAN i RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU NOT TO INVADE US, THANK YOU
I see live is cool
Legend of an ending
GOOD LORD THIS IS PERFECT
it's time to invade Canda
"I didn't say they were white people"  😂😂
I hope the next one is about the Vietnam War.
New video?
Nice video
As someone who lives on the San Juan Islands it’s cool that someone is showing this interesting part of our islands history.
"I didn't say they were White people" lmao
One epic educational vid          Canada and USA just be friens pls
Canadians after watching this: 😉 😴
I screen recorded the whole thing so I have solid evidence that I was the first person ever to watch the video
The production value for this video is absolutely insane! Outstanding video, once again, Oversimplified!  MWAH!
Lmao watch out Canada
Dude that end part was funny
funniest video i ever seen lmao
See you guys again in May
Lets go
Canada, the 51st state, thanks for joining Canadians!
Best one yet!!!!
That last closeup shot of Joe Biden looked like he was a sleepy vampire.
China 🇨🇳 Taiwan 🇹🇼 USA 🇺🇸 vibes right here
Another fabulous video. Well made and alike always hilarious. I love learning about little known events in history.
The ending had me shook LOL
Oversimplified : Uploads Students that needs to study History : OUR GOD HAS DESCENDED
That ending 😂
Well that ending made me as a Canadian feel targeted especially since i live in Vancouver and this whole video is a bout a war that almost happened an hour away from me. But finally oversimplified talked about Canada!
The chosen one is here
Nice
You're going to have to upload more. Your schedule is not working out for me.
Next video is about the Canadian-American war, because some YouTuber angered his Canadian viewer
Another amazing video. Thanks OverSimplified!
Nice
can we get an f for canada
God bless the North American Empire where Americans and Colder Americans walk side by side.
That ending was beautiful.
Alright boys, I'll see you in another 6-8 months when our lord and savior returns, happy Holidays and happy New Years 👍👍👍👍
C̶a̶n̶a̶d̶a̶  New USA
Nice early Christmas gift from Oversimplified
Cooll
Probably my favorite oversimplified video by far
If a war can start over something as trivial as a pig, then I wonder how long we can keep diplomacy going...
drake for president
You should do a video on the Anglo-Zulu war!!!
Hi
Was…was that Morgan Freeman’s voice when the pig offered three wishes????
Another 6 months later
Lets go oversimplified 🥰🥰🥰🥰
*shows American*  *American pulls out ak74* Oh I wish, those fuckers are impossible to get here
*shoots the pig* Pig: I didn’t die! I merely failed to live!
Alcohol 🍺 is delicious oh I’m sorry malicious sorry Wayne I’m kinda drunk right now
LOL
Funniest video ever!!! This is an a perfect way to learn History!! I never knew the Pig War existed.
Sorry to disagree with you but I believe that America should not invade Canada please.
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU CANADA!!!
CANADA
Biden coming!
GOAT of Youtubbers.
Watch as our favorite YouTuber, Oversimplified, explains a war over a shooting of a pig for almost 40 minutes.
OverSimplified Has the best videos I've ever watched I love history and he makes them 100x better

The ending justified the entire video.
That last part was great
Cool
Well done.  It was an honor to watch that live and enjoy the belly laughs.
MERICA
37:21 Most Patriotic Moment Of All Oversimplified
The ending 😂😂😂
Canada wanted a video. This angered Oversimplified, who punished them severely.
Glad to see you post again, I always enjoy your videos
Looks like destiny is back on the manifest.
sooooooooooooo want to not take over Canada i kinda live in it
I grew up in Washington State and you covered this in way more detail than did our 8th grade history class.
That ending has me wanting to storm the streets of Vancouver. Never felt so patriotic in my life.
My Christmas is complete now. Thank you Oversimplified!
THE LORD RETURNED!
The last bit about invading Canada sounds EXACTLY like Pre War America in Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas
I love it when Oversimplified uploads!
Quality as always
I love Oversimplified
"voice of the pig"- greatest job ever
Damn, it’s been six months since last upload?!
Wow, that Biden comment might start the next civil war
Haha "Biden's coming baby!!" Haha Well he does hate England!! 🤣🤣
The end of the video is the most amazing thing I have ever seen USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA
That end was fantastic. Canada loves you Oversimplified 😂🇨🇦🇨🇦

Biden’s coming 🤣
USA USA USA USA USA USA!!! (if you know, you know)
Oversimplified (in the live chat) USA #1!! (Vietnam Sits in the corner)
"I for one welcome our American overlords," Canuk Brockman.
Love how half of anything an American said or did was related to guns.  Love the accuracy.
That was some ending Oversimplified made.  I don't think he's ever spoken that powerful before
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
Ahaha, USA will annex Canada  wait... (checks address) (lives in Ontario)  OH GOD, THE US WILL ANNEX CANADA
Best.oversimplified.of.all.time
On the behalf of Canada. Drake would sound like a good president
31:35 I never knew an Oversimplified character with legs could be so cursed
Hi I'm late
Ya lets do it invade Canada
Very agreeable at the end of the video
dont hurt us canadians, we can give you drake but thats all
Probably the most passionate you’ve ever sounded in a video
That last bit was hilarious! I’m Canadian and that makes me smile. I’d like less gun laws and taxes. I say come on in!
epic
​United States of North America??
Well I definitely did NOT see that wrap-up coming.  USA! USA! USA!
Rip porky😢
Please to Marawi war in Philippines happened in 2017
Pretty sure the ending of the video is enough to cause a diplomatic incident
I think he’s mad at Canadians eh?
I did not expect the end when USA now owns Canada
As a Canadian I find that outro.... Concerning?   Oversimplified do you need to talk about anything? Have you been eating enough potatoes?
Its been six months since napoloens episode…
Wtf was that ending
Can you do a video on the cod war
USA invade Canada? Step one to the American empire.
VENGEANCE!
Welp now he's arrested for nearly causing a war. 😜
That was a pretty good stream
WOW GREAT SHOW!
🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸

Glad to see the Canadian rep coming in such a level headed and non-biased way :)
Local news reports that 500 thousand troops have entered the Vancouver, for the glory of America 🇺🇸

POGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOG

#comedygenius
EPIC!
OH. MY. LORD.   THAT ENDING!!!!!! LOL
Pig is pog
Well. That ending was…   …something.
This video was perfect, it was just as stupid as the actual conflict.
Ending of this video instills me with pride. Watch out Canada, you only exist because we let you!
... angry about us Canadians? If you knew what us Canadians did during WWI, WWII, Korea, need I go on? We have less, but we fight like we have more... which we do: we have more land lol
He’s back!! My day is better immediately!!
And that's it
Why do I here marching outside my door
This was chaotic and wild and I fucking loved it.
LMAO the ending
Bidens coming baby.
amazing
You know it's a big brain move when 160 years later, historians are still trying to figure out why the fuck you did it.
As someone who considers Buchanan to be this nation’s worst president, I appreciate the shade you threw his way.
YUS
I just joined at the last 30seconds and was so confused
Christmas came early.
HE'S BACK
Best speech ever
Greatness. Just greatness.
The best call to arms ever
Amazing
He’s coming
got here like 5 seconds before it ended ;'C
Everyone's gangsta till America actually invades Canada
No war is too ridiculous
I…I think I’m in love with you
Is this something I’m too Hawaiian to understand
thank u man
yep
MY MAN IS BACK!!!!!!!
LOL
USA really should annex Canada ;)
Why you gotta do Canada like that? We just like different things :c
Worth the wait 😮‍💨
dude wtf
canada is gone
Can you do the war if 1812?
North American Empire when?
NOOOOOOO I LIVE IN CANADA
This was great
After that ending I'm getting the feeling Oversimplified is starting to become Overworked
Canada
I loved that thanks for making these by the way.
Good
LETS GO NEW VIDEO
Well, that's an interesting ending
Amazing as always 👌
Warmongering
Are you Canadian?
The end made me Laugh in  Australian
"So...Is it a war?"  Oversimplified : *"Well yes, But Actually No"*
Me: not even an American Me at the ending: Canada is 'merica now cowboy
The ending is GOLD!!!! Let’s do it!!!! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
YOU'LL NEVER TAKE US ALIVE AMERICA!!!!
W
Ummmmm, ok?
Patriotism 100
👏 👏
One of my favorite episodes
What was that ending
My favorite video so far, great work!
That was an unexpected twist at the end.
That Biden ending is... Horrifying
I love that the personification of the us expanding even represented Florida as the geographic equivalent of a penis.
...
Why you no talk about Canada bro?
The man lost his mind
Lol
The end got me😆
Truly America
CANADA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That ending tho! holy crap

San Juan must be bolivian
Poggers
Dont look south
Let’s invade Canada!!!
Daddy came home with the milk!!!

oversimplified got very patriotic at the end...
I really don’t understand why people complain about his upload schedule.  He’s covered centuries worth of history in just a few years!  Truly impressive.
Fun fact: one of the islands in the San Juan Islands is name Skull Island.
the cold war but bought from the dollar store
Like
Who would’ve thought, Germany was going to get involved 💀
Excellent video. Well worth the 6 months in between uploads.
He had returned
poor piggy tho
OF COURSE I HAD TO BE TAKING A NAP WHILE THIS PREMIERES!
The parliament sketch is quite accurate
Poggest Video Evar
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
Yoo nice
Cool heads finally prevailed
I really wouldn't call have our capital burnt down and failing to push into canada a draw
Bru do the Vietnam war
Of course an Irishman made a sheep farm.
Yeeeehaaaaw, Merica!!!!
Pig Lives Matter
He's back! :DD
I kinda just... Killed your pig
Nice
Whoa yoh

"Whoa whoa whoa, I didn't say they were white people"        ahh the chorus of history
I just jumped out of my chair to watch this masterpiece
its always happy when you upload
Don’t mind me, just editing this comment to show that I was here on premiere
Thanks
“I didn’t say they were WHITE people” sad but true
I thought he would never upload again…
I mean just imagine Mabel Pines losing Duck. War must happen! 😂
It always felt like a holiday whenever oversimplified upload a vid
Should've made Harney the American "Emperor of Elba" maybe like the "Governor of Niagra"
OMG yes!!!!
Oh yeah
Long overdue
man its ben so long since the last over simplified vid i thought this channel was dead
Do the Mexican American war next !
Chopstick
Yeessss!!
Who needs sleep when this goat uploads! Love your videos! If I was a history teacher I would use your videos to help. Genuinely have a smile throughout your videos! You make my day
I didn't know what you did to the animation but now it's looking a little bit more realistic with the changing faces
Why are most American generals completely crazy?
when it says oversimplified but the video's longer than most other videos on yt..
But the Americans keep coming  And they don’t stop coming  Hop in their wagons And they hit the ground running Didn’t make sense to keep sharing Oregon  When they outnumber the brits  6-1   Oversimplified, you madman
This is amazing
Please make a video on the Mexican-American war or the Mexican revolution
We need to learn about these kinds of wars during school
pog
These screams are everything.
I literally almost lost my supper when I found out about this.
all those days watching  your old vid I finally see a new one This is gonna be awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've bin waiting since summer BRO!
Hey. Great job editors. But what happens to the other guy? Who? Oversimplified. Never heard of him
You know you're a good teacher when you have 64,000 people watching your history lesson
About me going to sleep at a reasonable time
You could've  chose the Vietnam War  or anything but no
Let's go new video baby!!
You should do the goat war to
HE'S ALIVE!!!!!
I like train
He has returned to bless us with funny history videos…
Man do we know how to over escalate things apparently
FINALLY HE UPLOADED
I was rewatching the napoleonic wars (again) and had the gut feeling you would upload. The next day this happens. BEST. FEELING. EVER
☃️
When history classes needed him the most he returned
Poor Lyman he just wanted some bacon
I love the pre-show ads. Really makes it feel like a movie. Me and the boys are watching with great interest.
Noice.
Who else is here in Germany, watching this live at 1 am? 😅
Filipinos love you oversimplified
I did not expect the tommy gun execution of buffalos and SPIRIT bombers as God’s intended Will, along with the totally era approved Macdonalds and trains.
So you see, General- I feel like I have heard that from somewhere.
I have waiting a video for 5 months, and those 5 months were worth it
Man I feel bad for Charles he just tries to have a nice farm life and gets his pig shot and his sheep stolen
Live chat i going off like a concert
The wait is over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Vietnam war please!
No wonder this took over 6 months to make. The editing is so much better!
Yeah!
When the world need him the most, He returns...
THE RETURN OF THE KING
5:33 is that Florida or are you just happy to see me?
Christmas came early
The pugs you drew are so cute-  *And then it started to stand yo*
Oink Oink
This guy is the master of smoothly transitioning to ads
As a Washingtonian, I can confidently say the Pig War is one of our proudest achievements. I hold the San Juan Islands over every Canadian's head every chance I get. Never forget the day all of Canada lost to 1 angry Washingtonian farmer.
Please make a video of Vietnam
OverSimplified has return from hibernation
Very epik
This is great
Is this the origin of bacon or something?
VIETNAM WAR next 💖💖💖
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

¡EPIC!
"BUCHANANNNN!!" *muffled screaming*
Pig moment
Good to see a new video, always love seeing new history videos from him.
I love this pre-civil war history!!
What’s more stupid? Pig war  Or Emu War?

Happy to have a new video. Would have preferred a different topic though.
It has been so long since you have made a video.
Wow, six months for one video. How impressive.
Can you do a war of 1812 that would be awesome
I thought he died
this better hit the trending page
Literally was getting anxious about when this would get uploaded. The wait is always worth it!
I was just wondering the other day “It’s been 6 months that means a new Oversimplified should come out soon”   Sure enough it did
damn
Steamy McSteam Face is a magnificent name for a fine vessel.
Dude we have missed u. Glad u r well enough to be able to make vids and function in general. These are hard times
I could be going to sleep but I'm watching this instead. My body is ready.
Oversimplified is live!: dude…cool
Yes
Love your videos!

"Woah woah. I didn't say they were WHITE people." Lol

Me: *Turns on computer and sees new Oversimplified video* My brain: *Explosion*
Pig is ez 🥱
OMG OVERSIMPLIFIED HAS DONE IT AGAIN
Finally
Lyman shot a pig, who was punished severely
E
Nord VPN for the win
So basically Americans keep violating borders and illegally immigrating in complete defiance of foreign immigration laws... but they are mad when Mexicans do the same?
Why is the pig Waddles from Gravity Falls?
Ah yes. Wether it’s French or British occuptation, Canada was always about those damn beavers.
I like how he uses the nord VPN as hair
I'm from Washington and most of these names are familiar
Polk! Not a great president but his presidency saw my state enter the union
Almost every sponsors from oversimplified are always NordVPN & Honey.
I love this. Keep up the good work.  Could you do the Vietnam War or The Bay of Pigs Invasion?
Your channel is the best keep it up man
i heard pig war,and immediatley started thinking about angry birds vs the bad piggies
Why is the depiction of parliament so accurate
Oversimplified is the one thing we  needed before Christmas 🎄⛄
Me when Oversimplified uploads: This does put a smile on my face - Thanos, 2018
This is the best one yet
Oh man, I feel for that pig 🥺
*RULE BRITANNIA, BRITANNIA RULE THE WAVES, BRITONS NEVER NEVER EVER SHALL BE SLAVES* 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧

The animation on these has gotten so much more detailed over the years. It’s really cool to see.
Yo
Went there for a navy league cadet trip in 2010, pretty nice place with a good reenactment community there to show off the battle of the pig lol
When the world needed him most, he returned.
Dude. _Very_ cool.
The animation is so much better sense the last video! Nice job Oversimplified!
Period
Yugoslavia wars
Fun fact: San Juan island is home to one of the few places where American government officials raise a foreign country’s flag.
All  I can say , it was wallpole
Wow at least they got some bacon
Hello marry Christmas

OverSimplified always makes my day When he posts
So interesting to understand US and Canada issues about the west , I lived in Vancouver ( Canada ) in 2019 . And I have no idea how messed up the West issue was .
The emu wars have been pretty quiet after this upload.
So that’s where Orwell got his idea for animal farm
I’m so excited for the videos!!!
