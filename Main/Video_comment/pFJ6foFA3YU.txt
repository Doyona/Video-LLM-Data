chunkz + filly = 10/10 content 🔥
Fillyyyyyyyy😭😭😭
Skinnyesta
Lmao missing reel😂😂😂😂
Filly standing in goal makes it look fking enormous 💀😂
These 2 together are hilarious
Bro why is chunkz acting so zesty ??
Chunkz cheated at the end with the last dribbling challenge Started way sooner, didn’t go around half the cones on the way back, and he’s decidin that’s a draw?? C’mon chunkz, u gotta know how to take a loss like a grown man
If they both were match fit chunkz would be better
Bra fully bare o raga masepa papa
Why did they keep playing on the turf
Why're they kicking from loose mats though, did the pitch not want them to damage it?
What is the beat called from 0:40-0:48
chunkz in good ass shape
Please let filly bag a free kick first attempt 1 time......🤘🏽
You are both a whole vibe bruda. Thanks for the laughs 💯
Filly obviously won. I've never see so much cheating in a dribbling challenge before thanks to my man chunkz 🤣🤣
Chunkz "ohH mY GaWd" when he saw the man from the back was fucking hilarious 😂😂
Loved this😂 also beta squad content please
That last crossbar shot from Filly was beyond cold!
The budget was low on this one with these knacks patches of grass 😅 Nah just jokes PD!
Is Jesus Christianity as controversial as Muhammad Muslim?
love how you can hear filly say “wallah” every now and then
Hey guys what’s the name of the jacket that chunkz is wearing .it says New balance .but what’s the actual name of jacket
Gooo Chunkz 📣
Chunks has 2 left feet when dribbling lol.
Nice of JustEat to give the number 1 customer a jacket.
Yooo filly with the CLUTCHNESS at the end ahahahahaha I'm dying 🤣🤣

Editor, you gotta grade the footage dude. Three clips left in Log.
Fillys like the gal in hpe when the ball comes his way 😂😂
Why is it so hard for Chunks to say "Jesus Christ"?? 😂😂😂 Every time he goes by " Jesus Christian"
Looking good BOI z
Let me keep it real, how can Chunkz be the better football player if he can’t keep up with my man for a celebration😂😂
Soundtracks take content to another level
Man London boys r just absolute doves 🕊..filly is a bad footballer..
icl that cross bar at the end was colddd
The new “Ant and Dec”
The groudsmen making them do this on that horrible bit of 3G has to be busiest guy ever
Chunkz will never get out from under that soccer aid shot 😂😂😂
Bro by seeing their run up ik they miss 🤣
What the fuck is this fake grass all about!!!👎🏼
Next video feature me . Thank you
Who brings a rug to the pitch
Sunday league side not allowing you to touch the grass 😭 waste men. Still sick. GGz boys
For anyone wondering chunkz enters the vid at 0:45       Nah jk luv chunkz progress is mad bless
Mad colab never thought I’d see these 2 together
Chunkz hella cheated, too competitive last round ran at the count of 3 and then on the way back ran through no cons, then lastly ad the fact that Filly scored a no look pen.
Wtf is that grass
Wish this video had more transitions
Looks so forced 🥶
Brooooo Yes chunkz He's in good shape man
Chunkz looking fione ! Great video
Chunks is the uk druski
Filly is the better player 👏🏾💯
Il do it for you,  AYYYY MANN. YHHH eyymannyhhheyhhhyh
chunkz voice crack was dirty
why’ve you put a layer of grass on the grass?
Should’ve just done the challenge in a park. How they got you doing it on some cut off carpet lol…shocking
Well done camera man for recording the crossbar hit perfectly at the end!...shit editing too!!!😒
“Wallah you got good technique” 😂  (Yung Filly)
Too much talking
0:01 0:47 8:09  Please don't Use God's name in vain bruv  Please  3:58 As well as the 'Walahi' thing, which is 'swearing to God', please stop   There is only one God The God of the bible  He has a Son, named Jesus Christ   Him and His Son are ONE   Jesus is the King of all Kings and he is wants us to Repent, leave any sinful living, believe in and follow him for he IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE   Jesus Christ died for our sins, and rose again   Jesus is Alive
ik this is old news now but f*uck me chunkz looks skinny
Why don't bbc give these 2 a show mad funny
Why they playing off some dead carpet
Next time employ me as the keeper lol make it more interesting 🦾
Not Guna lie they did you guys DIRTY with that Astro shit on the floor was almost no point in playing.
What’s with the mats like there not trusted on the pitch 😂
10/10 BUT 🙏 add HP LIKE SAUCE  👍 👌
U know what I love about these guys is the banter!! Filly needs chunks,they can offend each other in the name off making us laugh without falling out like LV 😳🤣👍
smoked the loudy before hand or nite before 😁
Why they on a carpet?
Their pure vibes 🔥💪🏾
chunkz is still doing content? his youtube channel is dead dead. he's slacking
Chunkz and Filly as the new FreeStylers 😎🤣❤️
Soccer ?
Dope
What chunkz said (jesus Christianity) o my dayys wtf are you saying pro 😳
These lot have got Chunkz saying Jesus
🐐
They smacked
PENALITES OR PENALTIES? Come on editor.... great content though and great editing :)
Dead video and they know that too
They both was really dead at shots! However Filly was better than Chunks! But both great vibes and bants!
Chunkz is just bad at Penalties 😂😂
Pro direct rationing or what where’s the goalie
Shocking from the Bromley FC not to allow you to use the turf. No doubt they charged the production a substantial location hire fee aswell
Chunkz and filly need a show on tv Netflix where ever it is streamed they are the new modern day Kenan & Kel
Was this filmed in Belgium? With all this waffle.
"Put the foot behind to know where you.." Filly strikes: no foot behind JAJAJAJAJJJAa
Weak content man
The video is dry
tthe name of the beat
okay, i'll bite - why are they playing on a grass pitch with astro down?
Why let them use the pitch just to make them use that dangerous fake grass 😂😂😂😂
Lay off the nandos u lot and you might not feel knackered
jesus Christianity???? Chunkz?? WTF
Filly and Chunkz both know that Filly is better than Chunkz🤣
If Filly & Chunkz had a show, I would watch it everyday
Someone tell Chunkz to lose the non existent beard! Almost compliments his non existent hairline.
Filly looks like the bad guy from Powerpuff Girls alie
@3:10 you should of put the penalty vid
Was gonna watch the vid but pretty sure this was where the guy made those racist remarks about the wall, who needs my view anyway
Why they on that messed up ground?
The "Missing Reel" edit had me SCREEEEEEAMING! 😂😂😂😂😂
I LOVE HOW THEY ALWAYS CELEBRATE EACH OTHERS WINS <3333333
My sons home ground YEAH! COME ON YOU BECKENHAM JUNIORS
Filly and sterling has something in common?
chunkz + filly = 10/10 content 🔥
the video quality is so bad like sport direct didnt provide them with a keeper and they even got them a mat to shot from man wtf worst video of the year but saved by chunks and filly
When chunkz said ‘i’m feeling a post and in penalty’ then fucking blasted it over made me crease😂😂😂
That last Cross bar Shot WAS CRAZYYY
that ending was a top 5 moment
Whats that song it goes hard
Everyone know king Kenny lose faze up
Chunkz is a Ward Prowse from couple years ago type man only useful from set pieces n Filly is decent but they make up for it with their vibes n energy looooool😂😂😂😂
Yeh love the “Penalites” 😂😂
I don't care what anyone says, chunkz and filly have the best chemistry in all of youtube and they're both so genuinely happy and full of life and energy, it's hard for me to imagine anyone hating on them
That floor is mental, so dangerous
All these videos are dead food
These bruddas never fail to put a smile on my face
If I were chunkz and filly I'd cancel this shoot, can't shoot on the grass? You give me something that looks like it's gonna break my ankle? F that! What club is this they think their f'in grass that precious
Why is there carpet down? Who do this football club thing they are the meedy tinpot club.
Chunkz saying that's what I can do on the penalty pitch Pov: thinking of his miss for england 🤔
3:24 did he say "jesus cristiano" 😂
Can’t lie chunkz has been looking so good recently. Really looks like he’s at the right weight for his height and build
Na chunks is shaped like a choc ice
did chunkz say jesus it was alamdulah
Best duo
that crossbar ping at the end madness!!
Bro that pitch is so weird....CHrisMD's pitch looks way beter
Chunkz cheated when he ran slalom 9:56 Look carefully
Ya chunkz be careful of the things and speech you say regarding eesa ibn maryam alayhis salam.
Filly is 10x better lol
You spelt Penalties wrong fyi
Biggest fan in Kenya 🇰🇪 but wallahi this was dead. This wasn't it. We need Filly in beta Squad 😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Chunkz my guy is better
MAKE FIFA VIDEO, THE LAST ONE WAS HILARIOUSSSS
Their Chemistry is unmatched
Showed this video to a friend he said they ain't even good ballers. Bro you don't watch these 2 to see amazing skills u watch for laughs and vibes 😂
10:48
Could you not.get a pitch you can touch the grass.on  loool

Would help if you weren’t kicking the ball off of a piece is carpet boys
That pitch is horror
the technique, the sound on filly shot of the crosbar mauuuuud
I'm so proud of chunkz man.
Why is Chunkz built like that? his body looks funny 😂😂😂😂

1:49 look at that yung filly spray lol
mans using me as rest - Filly
BRING BACK MK AND A PDS PLS
Been waiting for a footy one sn
Realistically the better players Filly
Get some footballers aswell
This video idea was dead
Maybe, it’s me. Tell me if I’m wrong, but Filly doesn’t seem like he was in the mood for this video and the last mean comments videos. I don’t know if he’s just tired or having an off day because he’s usually very hyper, running laps while laughing loudly in these types of videos. It’s like he’s showing his off camera personality over his more slightly exaggerated on camera personality.
Why not just let them play on the original pitch? Or just film on an Astro turf? It definitely hindered their shots.
L editor'
looool the carpet did them dirty I can just tell
these need to do a football video with sidemen
Fully is better
filly looks kinda cold in that jacket uk
I'll be honest, both dead ballers but great presenters and good vibes 👌🏽
6:17 ☠️☠️☠️
finally
When the groundsman bops out wid the pop belly uno he really cares for the pitch
Why can’t they kick off the actual pitch what’s up with the patches of fake grass??
Pro direct got caught slipping with some of the color grading. Just uploaded some raw flat footage from your BM6K? Mental..
Wow my girl said filly is the most disgusting thing she ever seen
it seems like filly wore tight clothes all his childhood which hampered his below the neck growth, only head could grow. :D
I had a big night, cried all night, saw this immediately, 5 seconds in I’m smiling. Please know you save so many by PRESENCE ALONE. Big love always.
Grass on grass?
3:24 man sent the ball back into the managers office
Chunkz seems very arrogant lately
When they shout ‘LOVE’ after a dead shot 😂😂😂
When I see Chunkz and Filly I see pure love💯
Chunkz playing in moon boots with those shots
Finally!!! It’s bout time.. I missed the boyss
If Filly & Chunkz had a show, I would watch it everyday
I wonder when their contract ends with pro direct if they’ll start posting more of these on their own channels
Man I love both of you guys 🔥🔥🔥🔥Please keep posting and keep the hard work❤️❤️❤️
These two need there own show on tv
