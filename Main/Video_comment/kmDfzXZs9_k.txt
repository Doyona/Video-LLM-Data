Wonderful one
Cares more about drama and headlines than actual athletic pursuits. The team Harden played for after the Rockets didn't see much improvement. They should practice more properly. Teams are beginning to understand this. Stephen A wants to take on any major free agents.

James Harden in Miami is the team that would fit him perfectly  I’ve always said that in Houston they should’ve jus surrounded 3&D players around him
Nice video
Good

0:26 nooooo, no, N FKN O, NO!!!!!! Let James Harden NEVER darken our locker room doors down here!
Very nice
Good
james harden is 1 of the goats , if he couldnt win with embiid n maxey its over
Awesome
Sas hating on black men again
As many have said (including ex NBA players), Harden may get a lot of assists but he does nothing to help other people score. He will pass the ball and then stand there, he won't go and run screens or move around to make spacing for others. It's below him to do anything for anyone else. Unloading the ball isn't enough for his passing to be a big upgrade over an above average player that will try on both ends and help facilitate an offensive system.
Who is this loud mouth old white boy on tv
Harden has been to a finals but clearly this expert has forgotten that lol
I bet  that him, Durant, and Kyrie  wish that they stayed in Brooklyn.
So now you want to go to Miami? GTFO! Im so tired of bro 😒
HAHAHAHAHAHA WHO D FUK IS THIS WHITE "WANNA BE STEPHEN A" GUY AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
james harden on the clippers with pg and westbrook would be an all time choke job, 4 for 30 from the three point line 😂
Actually that s a great point
Chiner
Dude don't deserve to go to another contender
He lead the league in assist why wouldn’t anyone want him . Helped a guy get MVP this isn’t easy
Nice video
😂😂😂 Harden to Miami?! the I don‘t defend or „play off the ball“ James Harden in a Spoelstra Team with Pat Riley mindset? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.  Ya better trust Doc Rivers when he pretty much said… there is no changing James Harden. he puts up stats and he changed from Points to assists because he cant get by defenders any more, but he might be one of the worst off the ball players ever.
Harden played in Finals with OKC…..Dog incorrect on that
4PF James Harden be in Miami not Tyler Herro
Stephen A is talking about Harden being immature, while acting like a fool with Max Kellerman and Terrell Owens
Only the knicks would want  harden at this point 😭 well orlando is desperate too
Stephen A Smith thinks every player should go play for Miami 😂
It's an insult this guy was on the Top 5 SGs of all-time.  Dude is the MOST selfish player in NBA history.
mad dog is awesome haha😂
I hate wen ppl yell tryin to get they words across as if it makes ur words hav more meaning
I love mad dog on the show his passion and voice are great
Harden to the lakers
The NBA would be better off without crybabies like Harden
Great rant by mad dog. 😂😂
Any team that gets harden will regret it.
Bruh, how do the Sixers front office end up in the same situations over and over again
If there's 1 team that should never pursue Harden, it's MIAMI. 🤣🤣🤣🤡
Jame Harden just retire. Nobody care about u no more!
SAS.. being loud don't make you a prophet or even smart!!
Good day h
Stephen A - hit the nail on the head - 100
Very nice and good
owo ki joss❤❤❤
Chiner
good
Miami better not even entertain this.
That is great
why this dude is still in the NBA is crazy to me. Zero defense, zero heart. He would be a thrill in street ball.
Great
👍👍
Perfect❤
stupid analysis..  miami's culture would force harden to want to leave again. lol.  It's not going to 'fix' him.
Wao amazing person I really like it
Seriously. Butler wouldn't want JH in Miami as well.😂
James harden isn't the 3 time scoring champion that he once was because once the NBA stop calling  anticipating fouls, he stopped going to the free throw line 17 times per gamr
Good nice
Дэкор
Nice
Good jon MAD DOG
Keep Harden out of Florida!  Period!  He's a cancer to any team he plays on!
Lakers should 😂😂😂
Interesting take by Stephen A.! It's all about finding the right fit for the team's success. 🏀👍
A lot of people in YouTube nba comment sections only watch basketball when bleacher report or ballislife post something
Send him to charlotte or Detroit or euroleague
Lucky....   left Nets. Seed #7. For Seed #3.  Last Season.  Seed #3.  Again... And Now.... Got all time defender Pat Bev!!#21!!   Nets Big 3.  Was a Talented Gift.   Oops
It's almost impossible to listen to this bloviator. He is totally into himself.
Don’t sent him to phenoix, ffs
Harden needs to be with Kawhi and PG. Harden and Russ will completely unlock Kawhi and PG
I finally agree heavy with SAS. 1,000%. James Harden being in Miami might turn Jimmy Butler into a Ken from Barbie. This is a great team
He played in the finals mad dog but it was with okc and he stunk
FIRE MOREY HE BROUGHT US DRAMAAAAAAAAA
Random but dude sounds like Joe Pesci from Goodfellas lol
James harden nba career is over
Harden is Kaepernicking his career
I'm done with James Harden, I wouldn't trust him if I was an NBA organization.
No one cares about basketball.  We just got out of it. CB we talk football now PLEASE
According to SAS James harden is acting like a child for 'putting his business out their' for calling Daryl Morey a liar BUT THIS MAN PUTS PEOPLE BUSINESS OUT TO THE PUBLIC FOR A LIVING...Such a hypocrite!!!!🤦‍♂
Harden is a hack.
harden deff went to the finals lol
Nice
Stephen A always respects everyone, maybe he shouldn’t every time.
Actually that's a great point
StephenA, you the same guy who acted that way against Max Kellerman when you stabbed him in the back🤨... why would you put yourself in someones personal business. Talk about sports, don't make it personal. Cause if/when he come at you, you deserve what he gives you🤔
Just trade him to the Wizards at this point
Harden never won anything ??? Is he not an mvp did he not go to the finals?
James Harden in Miami would be a tragedy. LMAO
Good job amazing
He wants another scoring title 😂😂
Miami would be the best situation for Harden’s career. He’d have to be in shape and held accountable.
Goldenstate would be crazy and ideal
Mad Dog Is So UnFair And DisRespectFul Lmao SMH! James Harden Is TOXIC But Not That Toxic!!!!!
I love this game ❤ 🏀 ❤
SA is good at complementing you in the same insulting you😂😂😂
Harden cries himself out of every situation he gets himself in
"In chiner" 😂
James harden is a big baby. For him to call out the guy that gave him a job is st****. The dude is a quitter. He likes the money but not the work. For anyone to talk about he GM is hilarious. The guy has proven he is a lazy man. Easy money harden lol. Talking about this guy is a waste of time.
The media's hate on Harden is real.
The media's hate on Harden is real.
The media's hate on Harden is real
Harden should have never came to Philly Philly ain't with all his flamboyant girly ways we knew he was a cancer before he came and all hes doing is proving more of how he's a coward
James Harden in Miami? He’ll be in Tootsies every night! Lol
Harden quits on every team he joins. If he joins the clippers he will quit on them too. He’s a perennial choker
What do yall think about this? James Harden to Indiana for Myles Turner, McConnell and Nembard. It works on the NBA trade simulator. Also Indiana will make the playoffs with their new big 3 in Harden,Haliburton and Brown. 76ers has more size against Bucks and Celtics.
As a Heat fan I don't want Harden in Miami we've lost so much already in the offseason plus Jimmy Butler isn't going to put up with his BS it's going to be Draymond and Jordan Poole flashbacks all over again if Jimmy gets his hands on Harden.
Harden is never happy.
lmao, lets not forget harden is still an all start caliber player n give u 22/10 a night. He can definitely make Miami better. he always did good with shooters around.
He Would Be A Better Upgrade Than Kyle Lowery 💯
Mad dog was spitting on this one 💯
Calling Morey a liar from China is just a good business move
Well he was crack addict  for a while😂
Only plays when and where he wants to.
Wanting James Harden on your team is like wanting Mad Dog on your network
The only thing that they got it wrong is Harden played in the nba finals
Of course not! The dude sucks as a teammate. His playing style don’t win ships! What’s the point to him in anything?
Dwayne wade is a child abuser and should be in a cell
James harden is a cancer.   Stay away
Mad Fog did Harden a major disservice; what's Harden's plan? I thought Harden would play in China. Aedin
“YOU WANT HARDEN ON YOUR TEAM GOOD LUCK!! HE’S POISON”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏿‍♂️
He did play in finals nd was the main reason they beat the spurs to get there just a correction
Send harden to europe.
James Harden is literally the polar opposite of Miami heat culture
Boooo!
The lakers going to get James harden
3:41 dude said Harden’s never played in a final lololol. He did in okc.
“In CHINER”???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If youre the clippers you would be an absolute idiot to prioritize westbrick over harden, handycap, blind in 1 eye harden would be a better pointgard than westbrick
‘Chiner’
I like him in Chicago
Stephen "Chiner" A Smith
Harden in Miami is the worst fit. They'd kick him out before he gets a chance to force his way out
Indiana would be a nice landing spot if he was humble enough to know he’s not going to be the primary ball handler
James harden is sorta similar to Dennis Rodman
James Harden and Jimmy Butler would be tough 💪🏿
No team is listening to Stephen a 😂
He has an expiration date that will never get your team a NBA championship.
Look where all those skills Harden said he has have gotten him 😮
James harden did play in a final though? 2012 okc vs Miami
I skip every part where mad dog the racist talks
He will go to milwaukee
Mad dog always talking like he inhaled helium before ranting
Mad dog is awful. seriously never brings anything of value to the convo
He was the best PG in the Nba last year, 1st year at the role. Show respect.
Mad Dog Said Harden Has Never Been To The Finals? That's False, He Was On The OKC Team That Lost To Miami
“I’m a fan of him as a player and a person…. I just don’t like any of his actions or choices”….wow. The mental gymnastics.
Harden was on the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA finals team with Durant and Westbrook!!
Why is he always against players, he's obviously against James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine etc., this is more beyond than just basketball
Wish James Harden Would Have Joined The Team When They Went To Boulder Colorado To See Coach Prime....
Miami?!? As if Pat Riley and Spo want to put up with Harden's nonsense? No.
I was thrilled when Harden left Houston, as a die-hard rockets fan, that was prob. the best day outside of the Dream era.  Harden is exactly what MadDog said he is, terrible teammate, selfish player and a quitter on top of that.
Chiner?😂
I mean he’s wrong harden has played in the finals during his thunder days when he was 6th man but yea he’s never been the leading man of a finals team and he’s right about everything else.. if you want harden on your team you are crazy because he doesn’t play winning basketball in the playoffs when it matters.
Day Off to VEGAS!!?? DOES HE THINK HE IS DENNIS RODMAN😂😂😂 ONLY RODMAN CAN DO THAT COME BACK AND HAVE MORE ENERGY THAN REST OF THE TEAM ( BULLS 🤩🤩🤩)
He is not a Allstar no more a role player at best. A All Star player is someone you can depend on.
I agree wit mad dog
Harden is to blame here for sure, although i feel like they're completely rewriting history if they think his "style of play" was never conducive to winning basketball. He literally was the best player and offensive engine of a team that won 65 games and was one CP injury away from beating possibly the greatest team of all time.   During those MVP-caliber seasons (2015-2019), his teams were consistently Great. Its not at all like Dame in Portland or Russ in OKC, bc lets be real those guys were never close to leading contending teams, but the Rockets were always in the mix and were only overshadowed by the Greatest Dynasty of this era.   Not defending Harden in this situation, but disrespecting his legacy like this is egregious.
So okc didn’t go to the finals? Puppy dog don’t ever know what he’s talking about
He is not a big time player he always shrink in big moments and disappears when the playoffs come
Harden is delusional asf Bro you only got 1 MVP no rings no finals MVP
“James Harden has never played in the finals!” The long term memory loss is insane.
From late great Kobe Bryant: he call it!
Still an All-Star? 😂
Chiner
As a Rockets fan, I bow down to Stephen A. Smith.
I can’t believe Harden is still in the NBA.
Is James harden missing ?
There is a team that will turn the blind eye for Harden,Chicago, Minnesota and Clippers seem like those
Send him to a dead zone like the bulls 😂😂😂
Investigators believe this was a suicide not a homicide.
SAS is wrong James Harden is selfish a cancer and doesn't respect sh%t.
"James Harden needs Miami." - SAS The last places James Harden needs is Miami, NY, and LA.
Clippers getting him before end of the year for bums like Marcus morris picks
Personal medicures😂😂😂😂
In Europe we don't tolerate that no club love...the last years what a expensive h.....
Send him back to okc. Maybe they will give the sixers some picks. Harden don't belong on any team that's trying to compete
Only teams that should pursue James Harden is a team that wants to put fans in the seat because he still has a fan base but a team that is also tanking because he is the opposite of a winner.
If heat culture is real Harden will NEVER be a Miami heat
No one has that’s why he’s in this situation. Not consistent enough to help a  true contender, not mature enough to help a young team grow and get better. I think him and Embid fit however, I don’t think Maxsey fits he’s a baller, plays a hard and will get better. Miami doesn’t want him, come on dude, this is a team for dudes who work that’s a disaster waiting to happen. Think about his epic collapses and no shows, JB, Bam, Spoelstra ain’t going for that nah. He’s with the right team, paired with the right player. It’s no secret that no team really inquired hard about him I can guarantee you that Ty Lue, Spoelstra, and Darvin  Ham want no parts of that. Teams that might deal with him Charllotte, Washington, 🤔🤔🤔.
James Harden a grown man?? He acts like a teenager!!
I usually don't agree with Mad Dog, but he is SPOT ON!  Who honestly wants Harden now? He doesn't show up when it really counts and empty stats.  He just wants to ball and get money and doesn't care about championships.  He's not a bad player, but he's NOWHERE near the max player he was.
He should retire. He do this to every team he play for
Do I think the Sixers should have somehow compensated Harden for him taking a pay cut last year? Yes, absolutely. But Harden should also realise that he opted in because of the lack of suitors. And as much as Harden is a talent, it was Morey who saw potential when he was coming off the bench in OKC and put together multiple teams that maximised his skill set and got him all those all NBA selections. So, I understand he is upset but having some floozy come out with a "Daryl Morey is a liar" sign is stupid and disrepectful. Bellicheck and Bardy had issues towards the end but you don't see Brady come out with a "BB is a poopy pants sign" after Tampa won the SB.
whatever it is, it just doesnt seem like a good idea to pick him up...
James Harden lied to the teams he signed contracts with. 0 sympathy for him.
The US sports media care more about drama and headlines than actual athletic pursuits. This makes James Harden the goose that lays the golden eggs.
You love to see anybody in Miami,, SA is more of an of the Heat than Knicks . All because he wants to be in South Beach to cover the playoffs
Harden need to stop team hopping and getting in his feelings and grow tf up .
He’s done he can’t play the whole season he should retire
im calling it now either he remains in philly (which I doubt) he returns to houston or y’all ready for this … phx suns 🤔
I cant defend how harden has acted for the past 3 years or so jumping from tram to team unhappy when he himself hasnt been that player he once was but still acting like he is.   But i dont like the people who say hes never been a winner or you cant win with him i disagree. Hardens rockets took the KD Warriors, who many consider one of the best teams ever assembled, to the absolute and some believe if cp3 doesnt get injured they win that game 7.   To me its unfortunate for Hardens career that when he was at his best and finally got another star on his team in CP3, thats when the KD Warriors happened and yea that ultimately means he didnt win the big one but hes an all time great still lets stop disrespecting Harden when we look at all time great players.
This dude always says Miami cause he wants to vacation while working 😂
Where exactly is Chiner???
He is poison. He will never win a championship. Hes trash
SOMEBODY gonna sign Harden that's for sure 😂
Not sure who purple tie is I actually didn’t hear much of what he said at all but I could listen to him rant for hours😂🤣
James harden should go to China
Harden wants a ring 💍 given to him! Sheesh he's ran from every team he's been on and he's played with Big Dawgs! I would not want him on my team.
In Chiner
Where ever Lil baby is thats where youll find Harden
If this was Kyrie doing this SAS hairline would have taken 2 steps back from all the yelling and name calling he would be doing. Smh
Harden is one of the top 2 most overrated former MVPs EVER.
Miami aint touching Harden
Maddog is funny 😂
For a grown man he acts like a petulant child.
Actually that's a great point...if he doesn't want to play with MVP Embiid then who does he want to play with? Harden is too much drama and if I were the 76ers I'd let him ruin his own career sitting out games
It's hard to act the way he's wanting to act in today's NBA there's way too much young talent now and the way the league is structured Harden btr get where he's going and fall in line or he could be playing his last couple years in the League it's a young man's game and you got to have major output to act like that he's just not worth it in my opinion no trust he doesn't got a leg to stand on.
Jimmy and James can share fashion 😅
Saying a 12+ year veteran needs structure to handle him is a wild take. James Harden has quit on Houston, Brooklyn, and now Philly. Harden has consistently flopped in big moments (9points in a close out game). He still wants the ball all the time as well.
Miami? You want that man in more night clubs and more out of shape
No reason to shout like that lol
He did play in the finals 😂😂😂
Nobody wants this guy anymore. He's a virus, unreliable, and selfish. Teams are starting to see that isolation basketball doesn't work.
Who cares about the NBA. Harden can always play in China. He can get whatever he wants, own the league and there is nothing Chinese Communist Party like more than sticking it to Morey for his political stance.
Harden wants out every year on every team
0:35  That's because he's NOT a all star caliber player. What have you been looking at.. his rockets highlights?
Mad Dog 😂😂😂
Mad dog is insufferable. Who enjoys listening to him?
Send him to Orlando 😂
daryl seems like a cruddy person and phili seems like a shitty place to play pro sports. lets be honest daryl and his ilk only do "good things" and "looks out" for harden because it benefited himself in houston at the time to do so. stephen is talking about daryl like hes a saint and not just another narcissistic self aggrandizing NBA businessman succubus looking out for number 1 (himself) . oh i wonder why you were soooo nice to the 3x scoring champion, you must have suuuuch a big heart daryl, give me a break smdh.
Stephen A getting paler by the day.
If he joined Miami and lost a playoff series he would request a trade
Years of this harden is not About to Change for Miami
Miami will never sign James harden he is the opposite of Miami culture
Harden is like Carmelo, he score a lot of points but don't help anyone win anything. The Knicks were better with Jeremy Lin as the top guy than Carmelo but because they were paying him big money they had to hand the reigns back over to him.
He has played in a final doggy not saying your point is wrong but he played in the finals you can’t take that away from him. Thunder vs heat
If you don’t want to be in Philly why sign the extension?  Do you understand what a contract is?
Miami is the worst place for James Harden because they’ll actually expect him to show up and workout   James just wants to hoop and party with little to no expectation or effort towards making the playoffs or the finals. Send him to Orlando
Respectfully, retire doggy
if only we had c.j mccallum, or jj reddick present there to shut this nonsense down ...
Mad Dog is right.  James sucks.  He'll never win. He's fat, he's lazy, he's a problem, and he's a liability.  It's really as simple as that.
Anybody that trades for him will just end up losing after giving up assets just for next year to come around and harden expecting to be paid max dollars next year
4:07, 🤣😂He pounds the ball!🤣😂Mad Dog is nuts!
Mad Dog was preaching.
The fact that sas thinks harden will change because of miami structure is laughable
Sir... you cannot say "respectfully" and proceed to dis someone... you are *NOT* Stephen A. Smith.
“In Chiner” 😂😂😂😂
I need to see Mad dog Vs Skip debate. I got Mad Dog
If Harden really wanted to win, he would have stayed in OKC with KD and Russell. They were so close to getting a championship. A few tweaks and the following year they would’ve. But he did not want to be a role player and thought he could be the man. Well, now we know he can’t be that man. He is not Curry or Joker. Nor is he has smart as Aaron Gordon who agreed to be a role player to get a ring.
if he lied to harden?   wait a second, wasn’t the new player movement, trade demands etc all justified by the idea that “it’s just business” guess what harden, you shouldn’t have opted in to any contract for a handshake deal, that’s just bad business beardyman
How dare he say those things in chiner
You guys need to back up off of James HARDEN,  man he got a right to work where he want to be ,, And to do what he wanted to do he still a prolific talent in the NBA so just leave it at that change the subject
There is no freaking way that Philly would trade him to Miami.
To see a persons true colors, just tell em no just one time. Darryl Morey told James no just one time and James went off and acted like a spoiled daughter
STEVEN A WEREN'T YOU WORKING WITH SKIP BAYLESS AND YOU LEFT SKIP BAYLESS BECAUSE WORK GOT IN THE WAY YOU GUYS COULDN'T WORK TOGETHER   WHO'S TO SAY THAT JAMES HARDEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSTON ROCKETS  SO HE NEEDED TO LEAVE  JUST LIKE YOU LEFT SKIP BAYLESS
Pelicans
"Over there in Chiner" 😂
I can't believe this mug suggested Harden would be a fit for Miami. The last person on the planet putting up with Harden's garbage on a team is Jimmy buckets. Harden going to get that beard slapped off
Stephen A also said Kyrie should retire….
Send Harden to the Bulls we will take Zach Attack Lavine
Man out here speaking nationally about basketball but didn’t know harden played in the finals before
he did play in the finals
Pat Riley is the godfather of basketball period
Harden has been running from defense and team ball since he left OKC.
We not a fan of you Sas all the lying on t.o all your business out plus getting Max fired after need him then threw salt to get him fired hypocrite
He's a joke!!! Bro not hooping! He a drama queen dude not tryan hoop!!!
Bro who is Stephen a smith to say somebody should stop another man from getting money
Best place for harden is the strip club 💯 he’s the biggest choke artist in nba history
Sas just lost all credibility 💯 he’s saying a team like Miami who’s trying to win playoff series and finals games should add harden 🤦🏼‍♂️ anyone who has this take shouldn’t be speaking about basketball on any level 💯
I'm happy the media is starting to speak facts about James Harden.
we all know Stephen A is the popo
Our last memory of James Harden in the playoffs was so bad he’s desperate to prove he can still win a scoring title, even on a bad team
Miami is a terrible idea
Why?  Does Stephen A. think Harden is too intelligent and not white enough?
Distraction plus zero defense skills I’d give him league minimum deal nothing more
People talk trash about Harden like he didn't turn a lottery team into a top 5 team in the league while he was in houston. The man gets no respect and it's shameful
Harden is a team cancer. Would not touch with a barge pole. He is also getting old and was already a defensive sieve before.
James Harden only cares about 3 things. Strippers , Food and Lil Baby lol 😭
Harden what a coward
Yep. This is why SAS brought doggy in.  Max would have shut all that down
Stephen Smith is often loud and obnoxious with the hot takes, but he's sensible this time.  It's probably not a good idea to acquire a player who consistently demands trades, leaves his current team high and dry, pressuring them to make potentially disadvantageous trades, and dissing the executives.  Like "Oh, okay, I'm a GM / owner, and if I acquire Harden, then next year he's going to tell people that I should be fired.  Sounds like this is going to be a good career move."  By the way, sometimes chemistry helps win championships.  You keep shaking things up and you're not going to ever have the chemistry you need.
Harden and Kyrie  both need to retire. C'mon bruh , Harden isn't gonna suddenly straighten out. Listen to Mad Dog.
Do u really need to scream to emphasize an argument ? Shame on this people!
Jimmy Butler and Harden will never mesh 😅
Stephen a not holding James harden accountable for the destruction of Brooklyn is very inconsistent
Come heat we can use him
Mad Dog is wrong about one Harden fact. OKC made the Finals in 2012 with Harden on the roster.
Molly 'riddle me this, Batman' Qerim
What happened to the end of the video?
Harden asked for and played with: Dwight, CP3, Westbrook, Kyrie, KD, and Embiid.  All 6 of those guys are going to be in the HOF and he STILL is not happy with his choices or destination. If you can't get it done with any of them then he should realize that he himself is the problem.
James Harden would get kicked out of heat practices by Pat Reiley and Spoelstra. He isn’t in good enough shape to play in Miami. Heat check your body fat throughout the year and you must be in good shape. 305 don’t want him & don’t need em. Harden would be good in china lol
Chiner?
Nobody wants a out of shape flopper
Harden might as well go play in Chiner at this point…
The problem with James Harden is has a Hot Chick Mentality Like a men, pursuing a hot chick, the NBA has let Harden get away with selfish, bad behavior for far too long, and no one has checked him, so he keeps acting like a spoiled brat. He needs leadership. He still thinks he's the girl with the curl.  He thinks like gurl.  Let's see where that gets him.
The white dude can outscream screamingASmith .. good grief
It ain’t over until the stripper sings❗️🗣️💃🪩🕺
Is it really fair for someone to say "no one should hire him", its just a sport and that man has a family. Black man lynching another black man on behalf of the slavemasters, classic Steven A'. Mad dog is the slavemaster's racist son, so ido t expect anything but "poison" from him.
This comes from the guy who tells everyone business or makes it up
Anyone who peruses this drama queen deserves their failure.
Westbrook can run the second unit and excel, no reason not to have Harden set up the offense to start the games
CHINER
I dont know if harden wants to be held accountable  like how jimmy gonna hold him
Miami needs someone who has heat culture and will actually show up in the playoffs like Donovan Mitchell, not James Harden’s big beer belly
Like Shannon Sharpe says don’t be a slave to Loyalty! Who cares what DM did for James . It’s about now not the past!  These old heads are just miscerable  and got there Panties in a bunch!
Murray lied and cheat the man out of his money, so y are they just killing James Harden like he is the one at fault.  He took less last season  n wasn't given what he was promised.
James better be careful cuz he could be out of the league if this keeps up
Couldn’t agree more
I agree with mad dog
Harden will never get paid again unless its a HEAVY incentive contract. Every team he's been on, he's wanted out/forced his way out. He'll be a minimum salary guy soon enough
hes fit for some chinese team
Harden wanted to be bk and Steve taking it easy on him shows that despite this scathing criticism  he’s still taking it light on him.
Where's Unc Shannon? I need to hear what he has to say about this
James for Lowry
Build around Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey as your two foundational stars.  This James Harden talk is a bunch of constant nonsense.  He hasn’t helped Philly - or any other team, for that matter - win anything.  🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
Na Harden stay out of Florida...
Miami ? Jimmy not playing that
Harden is the problem clearly
Darryl Mowry is not gonna Fk you bro. Chill, Stephen
He Had A Few Super Teams And It Didn’t Work Out He Should Just Retire Don’t Seem Like He Want To Play
IN CHINER!!!
Poor Lebron will get mentioned in things that really have nothing to do with him
Harden should just retire honestly, or go to china, somewhere.
Miami needs someone who is going to show up in the playoffs  Edit: Consistently
STOP PLAYING THE MUSIC AT THE END OF THESE
Dude wanted out during by Christmas. Leaked his internet in Houston right before they tipped off Xmas day. Team was playing great at that point and he leaks that bs. Always had an exit plan just no plan to execute lol
He's a very selfish player that is only about self, no wonder others don't feel the need to help him because he won't help you.
I like to see him out the league he's quitter. Also, he should've stayed in H town.
Nobody should support first take
Nobody wants to see this dude play
He's played in the finals at OKC mad dog. Lol
The way Stephan A pronounced China lol
Harden is just there to collect paychecks and flame out in the playoffs.
Is it possible that Harden might change in Miami?
Miami would never make a move for that loser
Trade harden to a strip club with Lil baby so they can chill. Thats all he literally wants
James Harden used to live down the street from me as teenagers and none of this during his career surprises myself.
I agree with everything Mad Dog said….not one lie was told
It’s wild somehow Philly had two of the games most toxic players in harden and embiid and even held it together enough to make the playoffs
Pacers should make a trade for harden best deals for philly buddy or Myles
3:46 that beat hard af
clipper fan here. ill PASS on harden no thank u
raptors should go get harden
I’m not a James harden fan but the fact that nobody corrects mad dog when he says he never been to a finals is crazy
Did Stephen A say “Chinar” ? 😂
Chiner huh
No team should want James harden unless you want to watch him dribble down the shot clock then travel with his step back three
Who edits this? Why did they cut off Stephen A at the end when he's making a point. Just end the video after "doggy" made his point about Harden. Makes no sense...
"China-er"? 😂😂😂
No team should want JH on their team
He’s been to the finals !!! Okc vs heat
I'd love to see Mad Dog and Joe Pesci on a debate
The heat doesn’t want him he doesn’t play d
There’s no er in china lol
Glad Mad Dog went off on Harden.
Ask those teams that rarely go to the playoffs for a year of James Harden.
Harden is overrated and everyone needs to admit it 🤣🤣😂😭 SMH
Talk about Pat Riley not putting up with Harden's mess, imagine what Jimmy Butler would do. Harden would leave the gym in tears every day. 😂😂
Stephen A: Chin-er
Stephen AZZ Whole Smith Speaks out of both sides of his Neck flip flopping all the Time 😂!!!
I've never seen a franchise messing it up so consistently over the course of several years. The 76ers could have had it all but, they passed on Tatum choosing Fultz instead, they could have kept Butler, instead they decided to go with Harris, they got themselves into a amateurish dead road twice, first with Simmons and then with Harden. Incredible. The final stroke will probably be Embiid rightly asking for a trade to go play with Butler in Miami or in New York.
First time doggie made sense
Cry me a river 😂 🗑️
riley would never go after harden
Doggie... Harden has played in 1 finals series. Not "zero".
Harden to Miami. Lmao bro would skip games and training practice to those exclusive Miami strip clubs 😂
Miami is already running a skeleton crew in terms of talent. All they got Herro, Butler, and Bam. Everyone else is a role player, most of which are players other teams dont even want outside of C. Martin. At this point, to get him, the Heat would have to give up so much - he wouldn't have a team to play with. You think Miami's bench is thin now? Now? Look at it after this trade
Clips and Heat would be perfect fits for Harden. Teams that has Established defenders and who also have a need for a playmaking pg
Harden is a donkey. Worthless in playoff
Molly always looks so detached from the conversations
Harden will not survive in Miami with Pat Riley there and his philosophy.
Doggie was spot on😂lol
Mad Dog off half a gummy
He doesn't care because Harden knows he got China as a fall back. China loves him and he can play ball there at 50
Harden would cry real tears if he landed in Miami.  He lacks the discipline required to be there.
SAS: “ Over there in Chinar”….
Chiner🙃
Clippers want him but 76ers won’t trade him
Harden has Kaepernicked himself in the NBA. His next team will be in China.
Harden needs to reture
bricc ross is a bacteria that turns in2 a parasite that goes around infectin franchises an players. it's no longer bout basketball w/ this clown. if how to ruin your career was a person. trill burgers aka honeybuns needs a 1zt class ticcet out the league.😑😑
Chiner?🤔🤔🤔
All he’s going to do is ask for another trade. I say let him stay home no GM should want him on their team.
Miami didn't want Harden, but now that they lost out of Lillard and Jrue, they're suddenly dateless on prom night. Harden's suddenly looking real good and they're talking themselves that Riley and co. can control his antics. There's a chance Morey can steal Herro from the Heat for this.
Harden has played in the finals. Mad dog needs to get his facts right
SAS be lying and fabricating narratives about people all the time and he called Harden a petulant child for calling out Morey for lying is hilarious not sayin harden is right or wrong but SAS just gotta no better sometimes SMH somebody gone catch him lacking oneday he runs his mouth to much and be wrong alot!
Imagine if Denver gets him! It's game over...
Good job MAD DOG👏🏾
It's time for Harden to GO!! Many entitled players got ousted with b-ball left in him. He is a virus wherever he goes with little upside. Lesson time. But he will land somewhere
Doggie is so fking relentless and funny
Harden need to get it together and stick with a team smh.
If this man gets traded to Miami Jimmy Butler is gonna have a serious grown man conversation with him one time thts all it takes for Jimmy to talk to u and then flip the script and start cussing at u and James Harden is just too soft for tht he doesn’t play defense and the light work he does on offense he thinks is gonna save his career not In Miami thts the wrong place to go thinking your not gonna work and u just finna sit on the beach all day
rather have harden than Bradley Beal wit kd
Stephen A. Always talking out Both sides of His Mouth, And We dnt want James Harden in Miami!!!! Lol
James Harden deserves to get Carmelo'd for a season.
That white guy is spitting facts but he so passionate with the shouting, that I gotta turn down my speakers 😂
What Doggy talking about, Harden did play in a final,  they lost to Lebron, D wade and the Heat
We in Miami don’t want, need, value, or care of Harden. Who cares if he needs us
Send James harden for CJ and picks to the pelicans and they might make some noise
Who would want a headache on their team?
Harden has brought nothing but burden to every team he has played for after the rockets. I wouldn’t want him on my team and teams are starting to realize that
Harden in Miami would be a horrible thing. Harden misses games, and chokes when he does play. Jimmy Butler would NOT let that sh!t fly. Polar opposites in terms of atittude. Just no.
He sucks and should retire
Id like to ask SAS where on the planet can we find " ChinER " ?
He should just go to China
Let him go play in China
Please to Mavs! Luka, Irving and Beard would be most iconic trio😂😂😂😂😂
Ducks of Beijing strip clubs only 😁
I realize Embiid and Butler got along well, as did Embiid and Harden, but somehow I can’t see Butler tolerating Harden.
Why does even wanna leave the 76ers! Jus run ur back wit embiid
SAS - you are out there in Chinar 😂
Lets get this str8 so yall blame players when they can’t adapt then when they do treat them like they not good anymore😂Soon as harden left the rockets everybody said it would work with the nets so he turned into a pass first player ….if somebody the media loved did the same thing(cp3) they would be showering him with praise
SAS is a liar
Stephen A wants any big free agent to go to Miami so he can hopefully be there during the post season. Sole reason.
“No wonder should pursue him”   James like wonder of U 😭
Stephen A Smith is horrible for saying no should pursue Harden..
SAS calling someone else a petulant child should be a wake up call. The audacity.
A "professional" journalist said James Harden would fit in with Miami Heats team structure and rules on national TV. 😒
Harden will come to Miami when he shaves his beard 😂
I want Harden out of Philly
They should ship him to Orlando or Charlotte lol
See this is the reason they need to stop letting anybody be an analyst and talk sports especially when you've never played..
Memphis
We ain’t that desperate for Harden they can keep him we’ll settle with what we have in Miami and accept a play in exit
Why would you end the video like that🚮😑🤨
He has played in the finals stfu Mad dog is mad annoying
He'll pursue a deal whenever he doesn't get his way is my problem with him. Happened in OKC, Houston, and Brooklyn. Its happening now in Philly. And you're telling me to mortgage assets for him. Not a chance.
I'm okay with SAS "destroying" his own credibility, touting this nonsense to the public = Harden's not a good player, not a contributor to any team's success & he's not going to a good team that wants or needs him = it's OBVIOUS that SAS has some form of "investment" into MIA, otherwise he wouldn't be trying to get EVERY SINGLE "FA" there for no reason = the know-nothing media needs to STFU ASAP
Careful Stephen A x Dog. You know when you tell the truth they gonna say it’s hate. 😏
“In Chiner”
He not getting traded to Miami they not gonna help the direct competition
He’s right. He’s a minge
Fool me once, twice, thrice?
You think Harden would fit in Miami's system? No chance.
Trade James Harden To the Drew League 😂
He is stronger than Lilard actually just Docs forces him to pass the ball to Embiid.   Morey wants to save 1M to use him again using tricks and now playing him.   Actually he is an innocent。   Lets see the final epidose of it.  Hope he can be trade to clipper immediately.
Harden: Morey is a "LIAR"  Morey: Harden > MJ  It looks like Harden was right all along...
dude we known the story of russ westbrook, that dude plays well when there's no pressure surrounding him, allowing him to play his slam dunk basketball. As for harden, dude is washed. No one should trade for him.
"In CHINERRR" lol
Yeah send him home. He can kick rocks. Forced retirement
Toronto, Miami, Lakers, Atlanta, Pacers, Kings or Warriors
“In chinurr”😂
Night clubs will still pursue James Harden!
The one player who doesn’t need to be in Miami whether he plays on the team or not … is James Harden lol
Stephen A is contradicting himself .He first says no one should pursue him and then he says he should go to Miami. Stephen A is an embarassment
Harden to Miami? What about “Heat culture”? You think Jimmy is going to put up with Harden’s BS? That’s a horrible fit.
If Harden wanted out he shouldn't have exercised his option...That simple.  Any team to give a big package for this guy is nuts after what happened in Houston, BKN, and Phili...
Hate the new music at the end and hate the awkward cuts in the middle of the speaker's sentence.
Talk about black ball … but yea he’s a diva overweight and old … I wish he came in the size of him rookie year to prove people wrong and with his money and access to trainers he should’ve been in the best possible shape ! He will regret not being a better player later in his career  and wish he can play more basketball once he retires
F* NO!! We dont want  Harden Miami do not trade for Harden!!
Harden a laker
Pat Riley can do it
Nah i didn’t even think about that 😂 harden don’t gaf who a mvp he want out 😭😭😭
James hardens future is playing in tiwan with Dwight Howard and I like Howard as a individual but his time in thr nba was up
You gotta admit.. James Harden demanding a trade during a press conference while rocking a beer gut is a hilarious power move.   Dude turns into a mall Santa every off season and wants to make demands.
Throwing stones and you Sambo lives in a Glass House
Harden to Miami 😂😂😂😂😂 they will be fist fights and let’s be real here Daryl Morey did not cost James Harden money James Harden cost James Harden his own money so people need to stop. What has  James Harden done in the past 3 to 5 years for him to receive a large bag?
Steve out chea sharp as a whistle 😂
Harden to Miami 😂😂😂😂😂 they will be fist fights
Dude in the white done know what he talking about son said James harden never went to the finals
Homeboy is a toxic ran thru ex nobody wants 😂😂😂
