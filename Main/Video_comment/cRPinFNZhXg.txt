What do you think of Rhea Ripley's decision? 👀
JD has such an big head😂
In hindsight they never shook on it
0:30
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shut up Rhea ripley  Who cares about you anyway
Bros head is unproportional to his body
Daniel Vargas 🎻
I’ve never noticed his about JD but his head is big asf
Deep down you could tell this made DP happy and was perhaps rooting for Truth to win.
The cultural diversity in this group is pretty underrated
They need to have JD go back to his nxt gimmick and add Logan Paul to judgement day
Finn:  Wants JD in the Judgement Day more than anyone  Also Finn:  Trolling TF outta JD as he's about to get kicked out
Love the Judgment Day, a combination of badass Rhea and Priest. The talented Finn and the goofiness of JD and Dom  * Plus R-Truth*
Honor judgment day, uphold the truth.
JD became an imposter to Judgement day on this day and he show have been expected to be honest and uphold his word especially in a group like this.
I love how Finn fought so hard for him and now he’s laughing at JD and waving by to him.
LMAO @ JD begging to stay like Damien is his daddy! "Daddy please don't kick me out of the house" almond head azz! 😂
Truth joining the JD made dreams come true and I love laugh and live too just like The Judgement Day
I think the Judgement Day is going to break up 😂.
Guys can you explain why is wwe trying to make dirty dom look weak
Shainalopez
I thought JD was Finn's boy, he seriously don't want him in Judgment Day, after fighting so hard to bring him in?😂
brynely shoaf      Fiht  DMaaian  Prioet  NO Rha  RiPleye Ugly WWE   COdy RhOdeS
jd mcdonagh worked to be part of the judgement day
Wwe nxt judgment Day
I love how Rhea treats jd like the annoying younger brother 😂
Wwe next judgment Day
Why is Dom laughing? He had as much to do with the loss as JD
Fin Balor is the prince of raw and the only guy with powerful finisher to beat Gunther but truth is viking raiders run Monday night raw tag division they ran through them all accept 🧐🤔🤔🤔
R-truth might as well from this here be the downfall not only of the group but his contract as well.
He really do be looking like a funko pop with that megamind sized head
aND THEY DEALED!
I use think Damien priest was a real man, but lately he has proven to be Ripples little BI__CH,  when she stopped him from booting out the little worm from the judgment day. You'd look better in a pink to-to Damian.
JD is a future main eventer. Maybe like a future cm punk
"I still have splinters in my back"😂😂
Man if this was old fashion WWE we would be seeing Rhea versus Damien but I know we can’t have nice things cause I know that match with the fire in all honesty.
say what Uu want bt JD putting in that work🔥💯
JD is out of the Judgement Day R-Truth is in
Dom costed him the match tho..
Omg
JD is there to take the bumps and pin falls instead of Dom. WWE can’t build Dom if he’s always the fall guy.
It would be lit if Jimmy and solo won the tag team championships
JD is one of the most cerebral wrestlers to come out of NXT. The fact that they're treating him like a scrub is almost insulting.
Malarky!  Truth won fair and square!  he deserves his spot in Judgement Day!
Priest is going to be a cool babyface when they kick him out of judgement day
Jd looks like a grown version of hornswoggle
And Finn is suppose to be JD best friend 😢😢
JD looks like a girl with that freaking headband around his hair
Is that a new couch?
I’m not going to lie but it was kind of funny when Dominik was laughing at at JD 😁 but to be honest I don’t want JD to leave the judgment day and his best friend Finn Balor 🙁
Lame
Judgement day is slowly turning into 1998 dx (with the jokes and roasting each other) but with a more serious and talkative Chyna
Whys Dom laughing he lost too lol
I think Next Year Damien will be kicked out and he will be a Face
Finn puttin the L up😭
Balor is the worst friend ever 😂😂
"okay guys, its time to get serious" somewhere, a Lance Storm has been serious for more than time itself.
JD is wearing some serious shoe lifts lol
😂
Why TF is Finn Bálor happy about JD McDonagh being kicked out?
They should have just kicked him out either way he lost
kinda love JD ❤
Been loving them since WWE threw them together 🌹
Haven't watched in 12 years
Rhea is still the leader... I think Dom may be having a face turn coming when her and Damien start being at odds over who the real leader is.
I didn't want him to be part of judgment day in the first place. They should have written a different storyline
Still think JD is what happens when you order Finn Balor from Mercari
that dudes head IS huge though
Dom we’re is your title and your talking about jd
What is going on 😭
They are trying to push Dom into becoming like Edge. Rey Mysterio is friends with Edge so it kinda makes sense for them wanting to do that, given that Dom doesn’t have the characteristics to become like Rey. Priest will probably become champion and then get backstabbed by his group members. They will have a feud after that is done; Damian will slowly fade into the midcard.
Why can't the judgment Day just have R-Truth join them, why does JD McDonough have to leave? Is Vince still booking these shows?
Is JD in Judgement Day like Sami Zayn in the Bloodline?
finn is laughing
Look at them bullying JD 😂😂😂😂
Another star giving another big humiliating loss for the sore loser bully stable hahaha. Hope this is another step closer to judgement day shattering and losing everything and randy giving rhea a few deserving rkos
Hey W.W.E.  kick Judgment  Day out  of W.W.E   Can't stand them
Jd is the weakest member of Judgment Day. All hail the OG of the old 24/7 champion 😂😂😂😂😂 R Truth
Rhea just screwed over her own team by allowing that big-headed munchkin, that really isn't that good, on their team, in which he is causing division?
Rhea needs to shut her mouth
Jd sounded like he was in a movie 😂
Underdog blues.
of course they were never going to kick him out but it wouldve been funny if they had him stressing the whole night just to mess with him
Dominic actually was making jokes
I like how Finn was the one who brought JD in but he is like waving bye bye to JD
judgment day has become a pretty funny faction but rhea ruins the vibe
Wwe smackdown live Friday Judgment Day
JD is irrelevant. WWE needs to let him go.
Lmfao the way they all stood up when Rhea entered the room 😂 get 'em mami
You didn't hear this from me but Vincent Kennedy McMahon is secretly buying another 3 letter wrestling company.
Pushing Satanislm on our  children.😢
Soooooo R-Truth ain’t in the judgement day?
No, there is no second chance is over move on. You guys went way too far. You need to stop right now in the bloodline to have to stop I know why it was the bloodline  And  Paul Hayman Roman reigns will find out next week SmackDown that is going to happen because you guys made a deal so I take out John Cena. He will come back he will be because you guys want the truth because of John Cena because solo made it worse everyone else is coming back ready Orton is back return SmackDown, CM punk is back return raw. Everyone else is coming back AJ Lee, his wife for next year. next week I hope so CM punk will have his revenge Paul Hayman he did to him that is going to happen for next week. Friday night SmackDown.
They're making fun of JD for losing to R-Truth but yet didn't Dominick Mysterio lose his North American Champion to Dragon Lee doesn't that make him the weak leak of the group they should kick him out too
Why was balor waving bye? Ain't they best buds?
And everybody is forgetting the most embarrassing thing in the Judgment Day about Dominik losing the NXT Championship 😅😅😅
I thought Finn and JP were friends lol
Rhea losing to ivy would be lit asf tbh
Lol 😅
Finn really out here just laughing. He's definitely having fun with this.
I’m hoping that JD can go back to Jordan Devlin and they can let him be the Irish Ace that he is and stop taking Ls for no reason
I Love you MAMI 💕
Finn and Dominik waving bye bye to JD was hilarious! he's lucky for now that Rhea saved him can't wait to see what the newest member R-Truth does this is getting interesting.
Filler
Poor Ace.....laughing stock
Poor JD
Lance storm’s pick up line.
😅😅
Damian Priest's laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
R thruth should be in judgement day…would make it explode …very solid 4 man team
I'm so gone 😂
I thought Finn was JD's biggest fan & supporter.  Why laugh at him losing & potentially being kicked out of the group?
JD can be the live action Prince Farquad in Shrek. Just cant unsee it.
I love the feminine Goddess energy Rhea brings to Judgement Day
Damian Finn and Dominik break character 😂😂😂😂 0:03 0:00
Let’s be real priest didn’t want JD in the group in the first place but out of respect for Finn Balor he put him in the group a few months later since Fin and JD go way back 20 years.
DP getting mindf'd by Rhea
They keep this up Judgement Day might end up faces by WM
5 clowns
I'm sick of Rhea, she needs kicked out
The push from RR at the end did it for me.
Faction members making fun of their brothers for losing now huh? Well at least wwe is adding all different elements into their game. You would never see something like this years ago...> The guys would be threatening him or just cheering him up...>
Dom should no be talking he lost his title to dragon lee
This is why I watch Aew, Jd has been here since Enzo Amore was cruiserweight champion and he can’t get over, They are using him as one of their clown characters.  I’m not a fan of Jd or anything, but  I can still see he’s very deserving of at least the USA belt
You can tell Priest still doesn't like JD and was willing to kick him out.😆😆
Once Priest and Balor explode JD is going to be moved over to comedy skits with Truth.
Shut up JD (insert Peter Griffins voice)
Damian priest is slowly being babyface
😂😂damien priest you actually lost to truth
thats not fair he LOST R truth should replace him in the Judgment Day
What total clowns!
Rhea says enough! And they all stand in attention like soldiers. Would y'all stop with this foolishness! 😂smh 😒
Priest with his chest thong. 😂
Jd got a midget body and a big head.  he belongs in the oddites not the judgement day.
What does a non binary samurai do to their enemies? They/Them.
We like reah as well she cool  Damion cool fincool Damion gotvthecmonryvinthe bank still we l I ke fundamentals misspelled bad sprler
We like damoin and fin
I like damoinpreist  very cool.rita can u justvshutvup
Ok
That was nice to JD said to Rhea Ripley, when he talked to Damian Priest, he has a true Heart
Miss Ria’s old haircut
Jd looks like lord farquad
So is truth in? I hope they do for Truth like they did for Sami. Man, I know R-Truth is up in age but would love to see him on some type of run and have match at Wrestlemania!
Sami worked in the bloodline I can see Truth working in Judgement Day
Judgement day is 100% entertainment!
Audience should start chanting"you lost the bet"
Even Finn wants JD out 😂😂
I think jd deserves the second chance he already did a lot for then
Jd can’t wrestle I was cracking up I couldn’t stop laughing 😆 😢😮 all night r truth would be great in the judgement dayl
Definitely can see Dom and JD winning the Tags team titles
Its official Rhea Ripley is the BOSS😊
I love when Mami gets the mommy voice,.. Damien? enough.
I think Finn is gonna turn on judgment day
I would mind Rea pushing me like that lol 😂 JD lucky he prob love it lol
Why did jd headbutt Damiens shoulder
WWE should've stayed with the segment and storyline of Truth being in Judgment Day...
Rhea vs Ivy isn’t something I expected to see so soon
JD is half the size of Damien and has a bigger head 😂😂😂😂
JD looks like a Oompa loompa for Willy Wonka lol 😂😂
JD is the Meg Griffin of the Judgment Day.
JD has to take out R-truth permanently or put him in the hospital. That’s the only way he can make it up to Judgement day and earn his place again.
I think it would be even funnier if damian goes on a looseing streak and gets kicked out.
HOW STO[ID ARE THEY BECOMING?
R truth is gonna do to Judgment day what Sami Uso did to Bloodline 😂 i love this
Love Ivy! ❤ 👍🏻
I’m sorry but that just show how much the boy respect Rhea more then Damien. When she enters the room, How Finn and Dom stand at attention to her. They’ve never done that to Priest.
I like how they not saying anything about        R Truth anymore in this 😂
R-truth told them from the Door last week ya gotta kick jD out
In a steel cage
He needs to against   randy Orton in a table s ladders n chairs match
Jd sucks
Is he a dwarf?
No one seemed AT ALL concerned about JD getting kicked out 😂😂😂😂
Dom over there trolling 😂😂😂
Damien laughing😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 they were all laughing including JD and Truth😂😂😂😂😂😂
It'll be shocking if Ivy Nile defeats Rhea out of the blue....
It’s really a toss up of who was a worse pick to have the brief case between Otis and priest at this point. I have never seen a guy who needs to force speaking so badly.
Leave Meg Griffin alone 😂😂
Finn clowning JD is priceless 😂
Rhea should no be in authority
Rhea ought to be the leader of the group.
Little Jimmy can't catch a break
I can see JD being the reason the judgement day falls and thats what starts his main roster push, bc at this point whatever he does to them the fans will feel it’s justified
Man Rhea ain’t sh** man!! 🫤😐
I fully expect truth to be an official member of judgement day now. If not then none of the members of judgement day are solid. They agreed to the loser leave match and now they wanna act like it never happened. Kick jd and Rhea out of judgement day for this bs Damien.
Corpsing Finn is the best lmao
She's right. One. One of them loses it reflects badly on the whole group. Dirty Dom lost the North American Heavyweight championship. Why is he still in the judgment day?
Dom and Finn actually making fun of jd☠️
R Truth will be a better addition then JD
JD looking like a little boy 😂 Kick him out already lol
JD sales it so well
JD just dont fit in, nothing about him does
No one can beat Mami but Jade cargil could
Truth can't be in judgment, being too kind😂🤣🥴🙏🙏🙏
JD a leprechaun
It's only a matter of time JD is going to get kick out of The Judgement Day
Why do they keep being made to look like the biggest idiots in the company.
JD is a little twerp
Lol Finn waving bye like he didn’t bring him
R-Truth is in, right!?
Damian Priest is way too good of a wrestler to be putting up with them!
What's going on with Dominic in judgement day? No serious story line? He needs to get out before he becomes second thought to JD
JD lost to a former 2x NWA World Champion  So why are the Judgment Day laughing
Jd put his head right on priests chest like thank you God 😂
Reah push JD M😂😂
"I still got splinters on my back"
Finn and Dom played the background perfectly 😂😂😂😂
At this point I’m willing to admit….. I’m a fan of The Judgment Day
So there was absolutely no point in the match
Why does Damian wear backwards suspenders?
JD getting hazed is probably one of the best minor character development plots rn
Rhea looks so cute right here ❤
Priest needs a change of gear….he’s starting to look like a Gimp
Is Damien priest wearing Rhea Ripleys gear? 😂😂💀
Rtruth in judgement day could have a similar impact as sami zayne was for the bloodline. Would lobe to see it
Can't wait till they all kick priest out 😂
I hope JD can go back to his NXT gimmick soon. That version in the Judgement Day would be badass
Why is she acting like mother hen? A bet is a bet. If Rhea made a bet if she couldn't pin her opponent in time limt and would give the title to her opponent and won't ask for rematch
Really JD you lost to truth how embarrassing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’d be nice to get heel R-Truth.
JD and Finn gotta go. They can go be Newsies with Butch or som'n idk. But they drag Judgement Day down.
Everyone feuding with Judgment Day: It's obvious Rhea runs things in the group.  Judgment Day: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat? Noooooooo.
Nxt dominik and Rhea
HEY HE LOSE THAT'S NOT FAIR TO TRUTH!! HE WON FAIR AND SQUARE!!
Don’t get why the tag team champions carry 2 belts each…makes no sense since they aren’t put on the line separately
What's the point in having official matches like this if there not going to follow stipulations Adam Pearce do your job kick him out
Bobblehead JD
Istg finn balor is lame asf
Lmao can we get some American accents
Why Fox uploading videos at 720p?  is this like 2002? 🤔
L manzzz😂😂😂😂
Story wise Damien is having the slow telling of getting pushed out. Dom rides with mami, and JD is only there because of Finn. Priest is losing his ally in Finn over JD, and the power struggle with mami is putting him on the outs. It'll be interesting to see how they work his cash in. They are however, very close to booking themselves into a corner of not being able to tell the story out.
Damian is the funniest member on the judgment day 😂😂
Here's the thing with the Judgement Day, right. It's the same story every other week really. Someone loses a match, "You better not lose another match," they win their next match.
Rhea is so gorgeous-
I dont like Rhea's hair at rhe moment. Looks like the hairstyle greasy Yu-Gi-Oh players used to have in the 2000s. Aside from that, I really want R-Truth to join the Judgement Day.
but is R-Truth in the Judgement day now!?
R Truth buries talent. It's honestly a shame that he is back.
Damien getting the boot before RR
Poor jd always being the push around
Paul logan would made a good edition to the judgement day than JD
Wrestling is such a joke anymore
Worst decision ever
They need to stop the BS and just acknowledge that Rhea is the leader of the group because she does the most ordering around out if her and DP lmao
Finn with the backstage reactions is just hilarious 😂
I thought the group was supposed to be spooky
Fin is one of worse on the mic seriously.
R truth is a legend perhaps bigger than priest will ever be ..they need to put respek on his name
Jd M needs to be in the group with truth
He needs to get kicked out of wwe all together i cant stand his face
Truth in the judgment day could be good in storyline have him show shades of his old Ron Killings Truth with The Core of the character still comedic. Rhea could have start training Truth to bring out his aggressive side. Once the judgement day faction splits Truth can break free of Rhea influence and it allows him to be taken seriously and comedic
Hope JD is the one that ruins Priest money in the bank cash in.
I think JD is going to become face. Real soon
I like how Dominik he's laughing at and making fun of JD Mcdonagh when in fact he always "fails" and let's the group/Faction down all the time. yeah right like Dominik can make fun of anybody when i'm pretty sure here that out of the five of them he's the one who "loses" and gets pinned the most.😂
So we ain't gonna talk about the fact dom cost jd the match
The groundwork is already being laid for Damian’s eventual expulsion from the Judgment Day and subsequent face turn, and I suspect they’ll have JD be heavily involved in that process.
I feel like Rhea says the same thing every week
R-TRUTH WILL KEEP TRYING 😂, HE DOESN'T GIVE UP THAT EASY
Well, I guess Finn’s friendship with JD is gone.
I thought Finn was the leader after they betrayed Edge 🤔
Jd Mcdonagh looks like Lord Farquaad from shrek 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
Chris Benoit in the Judgement Day!??? 😲🤯
0:59 Hey! I've heard something like that somewhere before?!
Booooo. Kick him out 😅😅😅 Truth won
Where's Truth?? He won, so he's a member of Judgement Day. 😅
Kick the monster out
😅 I was hoping truth was seriously going to be in judgement day
Coward
I'm just happy that they're accepting JD into the Judgement Day
JD still lucky to be their bag carrier.
JD head is so big dude. Looks like Lord Farquad
JD is so lucky that he is still he in Judgment Day, even though he lost to R-Truth in a loser leaves Judgment Day match, and Rhea saves him from getting kicked out 😮‍💨
i hope ivy nile takes the womens world title from rhea ripley shes been holding it since april not really defending it against any real competition.
Priest gotta relax. We all know that Rhea is the leader.
Dp be looking a little sus his hair outfits
Shouldn’t have dom then been kicked out for loosing the belt??😂😂😂
Rhea being a bit of a hypocrite. I don't see her coming down on Dominick when he lost his title.
Something tells me JD is going to have a part on Damien's eventual removal from The Judgement Day. Tbh at this point Damien soon needs to go on his own. He would make a great future Champion and would make a good face as well, especially for the Latin community. I'm of Mexican descent but I do enjoy Priest's work!
JD needs 2 get a backbone
Yo i likes when Mami came everyone straightened and stood up, like the boss she is !!!  All rise for the judgment day !!!
Balor nodding like a little yes man in the background while Rhea barks orders is really sad. He started the friggin Bullet Club! Judgement Day has pushed him into the background.
Rhea calling shots in Judgment Day. The Great Chyna RIP would be proud.
JD is a joke. MAKING  Truth beat him. Comic relief. Eats pins
R TRUTH NOT IN THE JUDGEMENT DAY WHAT A BAD MOVE THAT IS,
I think Truth should be in and JD out. I'm sick of this dude being on TV. He looks like he should on some Teen sitcom 😂😅
Truth's unlucky. Thatsnotwussup.
Everyone knows mami is the boss 😂
Why is Finn waving bye? I thought he wanted him there? Lol.
JD deserves to lose for that atrocious fit
For JD being Finns people him not holding him down
Ngl this whole faction is a joke, it’s not like factions back then like evolution, legacy, etc.
I kinda hope they jump Damian out
Domi can make someone laugh
The bosses approved it Rhea and Damian so it should be in  And it should be a rubber match
JD was badass in nxt they need to bring the energy back
I hope this leads to JD turning into Benoit Wrestling wise
At this point Damian is the leader lol
DP is NYLA rose of the wwe
JD a goofy lmao 😂
I still have no clue who the Creed Brothers are 😂
😂 It was gonna be such a great moment seeing JD leave the Judgement Day.. 😡 til Rhea Ripley screwed it up! 🤦🏾‍♂️ Who's actually the real leader of the faction? Cause there can't be no other way
Finn phony😂😂😂
We know why they’re still sticking with JD even though he lost the match. If they subbed him with R-Truth, Judgement Day would immediately be the most over and most powerful faction in WWE, sweeping all the belts and basically ruining WWE’s roadmap to Wrestlemania.
I love priest but that titty tee he has on is wild
I don’t know why Dominik laughing he lost the North American title to dragon Lee💀
Finn instigating ...
we all know damian is going to split from the group and this is just another piece from that puzzle.
Why was Finn so happy?
😂😅 Yo Finn and Dominik are wrong this is like JD is the friend and the family is just clowning him
the laughter of DP and him shaking his head 😂😂😂 Dom and Finn trying to hold their laughter in while Finn doing the L on his fore head
Judgment day issa joke
Dom and JD are best friends fr
Finn and Dom clowning JD 😂😂😂😂
So reah’s retaining the title
Poor JD 😂😂 I died laughing when Damien Priest started laughing at JD you lost 😂😂
Let’s be honest everyone wants to see Truth interact with Rhea and Dom. Let the hilarity ensue
It's pretty funny to see JD taking a lot of L's in the judgment day 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Judgement day greatest thing since slice bread
🤬🤬🤬THE JUDGEMENT DAY
JD is gone take over Judgment day somehow some way 😂
Judgement Day break up incoming
Guess Mami is leader of the Judgement Day
I need the NXT JD back, that’s the perfect gimmick for him especially since he’s in Judgment Day
Finn waving bye to jd was funny 😂
JD has put his body through so much since being with Judgment Day. I kinda feel like it's barely even giving his character a push.
If Dominik thinks that his REAL family the Mysterio family can give him presents now, he is sadly and poorly mistaken.
I wish rhea would shove me onto the couch like that...😂
The way they all stood when she came
Me: You go have yourselves a merry Christmas, Judgment Day Scrooges! Rhea Ripley: And a "Bah, humbug" to you too!
the only thing good about this is R-Truth lol
Jd is just a trash wrestler nothing more
Wwe nxt dominik mysterio and Rhea Ripley
Wow amazing performance by Rhea congratulations on crushing and destroying for the win tonight. She totally deserved the beatdown and you definitely deserved the win tonight.
So....Truth is in??
Now why is Finn Balor kayfabe so happy and laughing about this and waving bye to JD after trying for like half a year tryna bring him in 😂😂.
so what was the point of the stipulation
Finn and Dom are not making this any better😂😂😂 especially dom reminding jd about Randy and Damian choking him😂😂😂😂 dom is a funny dude
That's B.S.😮
We see who's in charge Rhea is 😅
I wanna see cm punk put into stories with the judgement day
honestly, they should've let truth in because he won the match fair even with dom dom being there causing distractions.
JD is the Meg Griffin of judgement day.
R   TRUTH  IS  NOT  A  MEMBER  OF  THE  JUDGEMENT  DAY
JD Mcdonagh = Punching bag of Judgment Day
Damin was having fun with JD.
Aw, what?! JD agreed to it! And at this point, R-Truth is the better pick anyway! 😄
Jd baby face turn coming
At least R-Truth is in!
So Who Is The Leader? Damian? or Rea?
That push 🤣🤣
🖤Please don't play R-Truth💜
I knew it! Damian is the good guy in the story!
I’m confused here 😂
WHYYYYYYYYYY?! 😭😭
Good move stop doing JD wrong man make him into the badass he was in nxt
Second
First
What do you think of Rhea Ripley's decision? 👀
