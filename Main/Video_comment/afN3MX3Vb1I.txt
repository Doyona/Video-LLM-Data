whats the song called at 7:19 time stamp please
going back to this video after making a terrible mistake. Slowly working on my self-growth and so far things have been going good for the most part. This is inspiring for me to not let others define me
what a stupid video, 'hard video' but with 800 different cuts lmao
Idk why i just love coming back to this video
Though I haven’t messed up like Albert has, this video continually serves as an inspiration for me to do better and be better, fix my habits. I find myself coming back here often
Lowkey, 4 years later, I still think this video goes hard, I love the way he filmed it, the camera work, the story telling. It's a banger. I also learned that the internet is not such a good place to vent, because we move on, we create new things, but the internet, the internet never forgets.
Hey Albert, love from Surabaya, Indonesia. I cried watching this short-movie. You deserve all the love. I've loved your videos playing violin years ago, but never subscribed (I didnt subscribe to anyone either) thus I lost you, where is sleightlymusical? I found just now that u've change into "albie". Much love, always apreciate your talent, your love of music &art. I wish everyone will love u too, as u deserve to be loved. Looking forward for more music/creation ❤
Damn bruh he didn’t cheat on yall 💀
What a narcissist
Not trying to excuse cheating but the fact that during that time when he was in saying "yes" to everything, it makes you wonder if it was the social pressure that eventually made you derail...  This video was so deep and genuine - I'm sure your second chance will come!
This is a good apology
There's cringe, cringe premium, and this.
At the time I saw this video and sat there wondering what the hell was wrong with you and figured that despite apologizing you were a piece of shit and you always will be for cheating on someone. I really did not want to give you a pass.  That was 3 years ago.   Right now, I’m sitting finding myself in probably the same position you found yourself all those years ago. I cheated on the love of my life. And I will never ever regret anything more in my entire life. I hate myself.  Then I remembered this video. You made me realize something, something that I needed to hear.   People can change. I can change.   I made a mistake, and I learned my shit the hard way. I may never forgive myself for what I had done, but I won’t let it define who I am. I’m gonna keep moving forward. I want to be better. I never EVER want to hurt someone I love like I did with her. I refuse to stay the person I am right now.   Hope you’re doing good Albert. Much love.
Damn people still hating? People need to learn to chill everyone moved on already lmao
bro think he’s coryxkenshin 😭 💀
title: "hey it's been a while" first line: "hey... it's been a while"
I respect you bro this was such a good experience everything happens to a reason
He's right about one thing. This video is selfish. You're not a victim, you've created one.
i fucked up today. i came back here.. idk maybe for some comfort  I still feel like shit, but this helped a bit. im trying to do better
Where's the part where you're actually sorry for what you did? This is just an indulgence piece, made to stroke yourself off.
Y’all really ate this up huh? 😂
There's always an Asian that will apologize better than you
Hey the mistakes are still unforgivable to this day but i wish you the best if luck cuz all of us as a person can change no matter what
Aye man. Keep up with filmmaking.
its been a year, but i still can't believe what you did. but i hope you have a great life rn.
keep crying
come back buddy!
Okay...anyways
Hello, not sure if this comment will ever reach you Albert. But would you ever consider looking into Christ? Becoming a Christian from a potential Atheist for me allowed me to understand the brokenness of the world and true forgiveness that stems not in our identity from ourselves or the actions we commit, but from the love of God. You could even find a church community. What God says is that no matter how successful or broken we are, there is no true hope in this life as it will all fade away eventually, and that you can find true fulfillment, freedom, and purpose in Christ as well as an unconditional love & forgiveness. (While still enjoying life of course!)  I am a recent college graduate and volunteer special education teacher at a church, and I personally have seen love and kindness in the most broken of circumstances, no matter how hard. I’m mean like really painful things like depression, family issues, and life-threatening illness.  Don’t get me wrong, working on yourself is a wonderful thing as well as finding new hobbies! But ultimately, what is the point of everything? And what if history repeats itself? (No offense, but it is always a possibility) Many beautifully broken people find true forgiveness in themselves through Christ.  Wish you all the best and Good stuff making this incredibly crafted video! From a fellow human being.  -Durn
The impact of this content is substantial. A book with like messages redefined my approach to life. "A Life Unplugged: Reclaiming Reality in a Digital Age" by Theodore Blaze
It is not me, but my wife cheated on me but i feel all the shame because it was arranged married, I could have said no to it. I fucccked up, I am working on myself to become more of peaceful person. Cheating is not a crime and or should be a legal issue, but it is mess up in moral level in many ways. I re- watch this video every three years to remind myself that I can still live one more day without point a gun at my head and ready to suicide. Thank Albert by any mean.
He even ate his pet yeast.. the betrayal 😂
These are some L fucking takes dawg
Can someone tell me what he actually did?
I don't know if you will read this but, although you fucked up in the past i believe that you've changed. Everyone is not perfect and even if people condemn you.... I must asked the other people why you still hate the guy after years? What about you people who've fucked up in the past do you think you deserve the same treatment you gave Albert?  Even so Albert is not perfect he's just a dude who made a mistake but he want to move on. I love his content because i just enjoy music but i swear how long you gonna condemn the guy? The other people already have their happy ending but what about Albert? Bro can't come back to soc media without people bringing up his past fuck up. Bro did not commit a federal crime yet you guys don't even dare to give him a second chance even doe he only cheated. Yeah cheating sucks but how long?  How long should yall hate? Regardless, i hope you still pump out more content Albert and i hope other people can forgive you too. The video is very cinematically pleasing to watch and you are also self aware that this video was a bit selfish but then again it's ok because you're giving yourself a second chance even when others dont
he's talented but this whole video comes off narcissistic and not genuine in any way. I just see it as he wants to try to rebuild his social media presence without truly owning up to what he did. nothing about this makes me feel like he would never cheat on someone again. tbh he should just go into film making.
damn.
Loserrrr
Until he can forgive himself.
When I first watched this years ago, I thought it was over-produced and more a commercial for himself than anything. I think that even more now. Sourdough and pour over coffee? Bruh, him and literally every other dude in America. Not that it is relevant, but that bread is flat as can be, which means he didn't even really learn bread-making. This is and was complete posturing.   Obviously what he did doesn't mean he should be cancelled. Lots of people betray the trust of their partners. Most people have been cheated on. Turning that into a commercial is weird. Like a PR firm came up with it.   I think there was a mystique to Albert, how quiet and self-possessed he was. This shows that he is just a terminally mid dude who puts way too much time and effort into how he is perceived. Again, not a crime but just.. lame I guess.

I wanted to send some intense comment but I can't find the right words and thats because this shit isn't about me or his veiwers or lily's veiwers its about them so I don't know why I'm trying to say something about it
Washed
ayo anyone know where hiking spot 10:53 is
everyone be tolerating a cheater lmfao i could never
I come back to this video every once in a while for encouragement. I too struggle with guilt, shame, and self loathing, and but he teaches me to work hard towards self-forgiveness.
You’re right, Albert! You don’t exist to fill your haters’ curiosity!
I love Lily don’t really know you bro, but I do know struggle and pain in extent detail and you need to tell all that to f itself. You have to be a man of morale and righteousness  bro but the whole reason I’m writing this is to mention that this is a great video and edit you really got something bro chase it and destroy the past with hustle best of luck breh.
Wait is albert dad disguisestoast from the past
How did you knew about what did he do? I can’t figure it out, where did you all got that information, who’s lily? Why they broke up? How did everybody knew about it?
Wow.... really love this video, be strong !!!
I'm sorry for what I've said 2 years ago.
We’re proud of you. You’ve done some shitty things, but at least you recognize it and are working on it, rather than asking for pity or taking it out on others. We love you king
3:55. It's true. (ffck that)
Thank you so much for this video. It is so powerful. Thank you for sharing how you picked yourself up with the power of music and art. It is such a redemptive process. You are given so much talent and gifts as an artist. With that power, you began the journey of self-healing. And with this journey, you are empowered to heal others, as this video is to me. I am encouraged by how music, healthy routines, and close relationships helped you. It reminds me of how I need to connect myself with these things too to pick myself up from the pit I am in. Again, thank you. Although I only see this 2 years after it was uploaded, the power remains. it is an artistic piece for all who are struggling and isolated.
Just get the new update bro
U didn't deserve to be canceled lol
Can't wait to cheat on my girlfriend, get caught and make a redemption arc out of it
Was learning about the drama again and went to the channel at least you know you f-upped
well Lily forgave you and its best to focus on your life to be better again. wish you an awesome life
The fact that he shows the flower Lily to represent Lily is just so freaking smart
Cringe
lily only wants what’s best for albert and for him to take care, we can only move forward and if you’re a real fan of lily you support her decision and not spread anymore hate the albert. you can dislike him and just leave it be. let him learn and grow from the past and create a better future for himself 💗
He cheated. Honestly I don't care. I just waited for him to return. In America people treat marriage as dating. They fuck. They break up. They're used. But they're another person trash. No one gives a fuck. Just drama to ruin someone, it makes them happy. Everyone just mind their bussiness. By the way, Hi Albert I didn't realize you were back.
I remember watching this video in the midst of the heated tea spilling. I thought it was interesting but kind of scuffed it off. After making regretful mistakes in my life, I came back to this video and everything makes so much more sense to me. I didn't expect to tear up this time. The video was artistic and very well crafted.
Albie. I wholeheartedly wish you well on your new journey towards self awareness, love and respect.
Interesting…I wish you the best Albert!
Albert i wish youre still happy its been a year i wish you happiness
Why do people’s life lessons have to be derived and cause from someone else’s trauma?
0:35 emotional damage
Damn this was very thought up and edited. Amazing, hope to see more.
Albert, Though I'm sure you'll never see this comment, I want you to know that you've taken the time to change and grow as a person. You recognized that what you did was wrong immediately. I remember watching this video back in 2020 when I had no clue who you are and what this video was about, so I clicked off after the video ended. I'm back today in 2022, and in all honesty, you're an inspiration. Your words and advice are really useful and you allow us to learn from your mistake. I don't feel that it is my place to speak on what happened, but I just wanted you to know that you've taught me a lot just through this video. and everyone deserves second chances.
This is how you do an apology video. Other youtubers take notes you sociopathic narcissistic fucks
Tbh to us viewers with neutral point of view, its more of like a motivational video So i feel good seeing this great productive visual video that turned out to be a motivational video in a way..maybe it just me but uk when uk lol  Also best of luck in your life
Redemption arc?
Making this type of video he never needed any of them 🫡 you’re content is now better cause you can now work on yourself☝️
Idk if it made itself as an apology video to that person but it's a motivational video for me, I come back again and again when I feel shit or feel like giving up.
I love you -JesusChrist
BUT U HAVE NEW CHANNEL
imagine cheating
its been a year :)
I'm back to this film masterpiece
being the guy who sits right in the middle of a gamer and a fiilmmaker,photographer or an artist... I love you so much
Every now and then the old YouTube Spirit shines ✨️ Thanks again ✌️
AWESOME VIDEO I hope I can be as talented and understanding/mature as you are in my next life. Thank you for sharing this video. 🙏 😁  even though it comes from a place of pain. I hope you and your significant other are happy. 🖖✌️
great vedio, hope things go well for you.
What you did really wrong aside, taking this video, no, this art form as a whole, it really inspired me to move on and live life to the fullest because of your words, delivery and the fact that I relate to you in a way. Congratulations for owning up to your mistakes and living life, and thank you for the art.
At least your video actually seems like an apology versus how fed’s was like “haha guys look at me I’m still ok”
i hate cheaters and they know what they didi and it cant be an accident I am in noplace to forgive because its not my job to but I hate him lol
0:52 is this.. Lily?
This is a timeless piece of art. It looks like albert's story, but it has much more. Guide and encouragement for hard times for me. Good luck everyone, keep it up.
We human have made lots of mistakes. You made a f**king big one and regretted   from it. I do believe in second chances but not much in the next next chances. So cheer u and step up from this.
I'm hoping you'll create more cinematic stuff like this. 💖
Whats the music? 5:15
Whats the music 6:08
This is actually a pretty solid apology video, and Lily forgives him too. Completely accept this happy for him working on himself
6:41 it's not clique it's only clique because everyone has to go through it :)
Rip grandma
Hey I respectyou This is actually good o7 buddy ill miss you o7
YOU GOT MY PILLOWS
Atleast you didn't pull a fed
what’s going on some one tell me plz
The fuck is this
You know what? Everything you said here could help a lot more people. Thank you for saying and sharing this. ♥
did he really own up to his mistakes tho if he barely even addressed it
ARGENTVM
.
I wish you could talko more about those creative projects
Honestly people all fuck up!! it's life. You have to remind yourself you are no better than the person watching this film. Just because you have views and numbers behind you doesn't place you higher or lower than anyone else. You are human. You are you. If those who disagree with you and tell you are scum, fuck em. Just know that you have to be happy for you. Enjoy it one day at a time. Also i know i am a lear late but know all of this will be different and have a different out come every single time.
As much as I want to dislike this man I can't. I just Can't.  He regrets what he did to such an extent that it STILL effects him, nearly two and a half years later. He is witty, somber, and somehow, seeing as I personally, outside of the music aspect of my life, am nothing like him, he is relatable. He has clearly put so much time and effort into a video that doesn't ask for forgiveness and that doesn't try to reason with the viewer, that simply tells the story of someone who flew too high too fast. Of someone who didn't take into account the mental fatigue of the lifestyle he chose. His story of wanting to be better is reflected in his recent social media posts and his clear desire for self improvement is something I can honestly say that I wish I possess.. This is a content creator that I will be happily picking up again in this new year, after a long two and a half year hiatus.   You've done well man. You've done well.
I don't know all that happened and it's not in my place to judge you based on what's on social media, but this made me really emotional. I'm proud of you. We're all trying.
Honestly I got bored watching this. Dont think we will ever forgive you for what you did to Lily.
your spacebar upsidedown
I just rewatch this cause of the amazing cinematic
0:52 nice touch didnt realize on my first watch thru
What's up with your space bar?
1M pog or whatever
Albert > Michael
Well.. gah dayum.
Lily is doing better without so it was probably for the best
I'm not your fan. But I know what you did and  I hated you for it in behalf of the person concerned but damn, this made me change the way how I see you completely. You were the first person who really gave life to the phrase, "Your mistake doesn't define you." So kudos to you sir and your path of redemption. I'm rooting for you.
Bunch of incels trying to justify his behavior lol
This really gave me the motivation to do things, thank you so much for influencing me.
It's not an apology video folks. He said it in the beginning that it's a reminder, it's a video for himself. This video is about him rekindling his passion in music, content creation, etc. It's about restoring himself.
Wow. Best apology I've actually seen
It's weird that a video claiming to "take responsibility" is chock full of excuses and subtle deflections. On the surface he apologizes but there are so many subconscious ways he's manipulating the viewer. He literally starts out the video by shaming the audience for being interested in the drama. This is to "spread" the blame so the audience feels guilty and makes his actions seem less egregious by the fallacy of "well we've all done flawed things thus we're all equally flawed." There are also so many excuses in this video, of course its a sob story and of course he has depression. I had depression and during the course of it I was trying so hard to not lose my s/o because she's the only one that really made me happy, and I lost her anyway and it was the hardest thing in my life. The concept that he's trying to justify, that "depression made him make these choices," a choice including to forsake a good s/o,  is so foreign to me that I just can't believe it. He stops short of directly trying to excuse his actions through his sob story but the fact that they're in the same video is a conflict of interest enough for me.   What this video really is is a character rescue. Its fantastic production value, surface relatability and apparent apology will easily convince the average vapid Youtube user to forgive and forget. It's incredibly well made and targeted in that regard. Y'all can decide for yourselves if based off this video you forgive him, or I guess in this case continue to watch his content because the "forgiveness" of someone who wasn't victimized is in my opinion largely irrelevant. But I think it would have been so much more genuine if he just made an apology and explanation (even if that explanation is that he can't explain why he did it), not an apology coupled with his pathetic life story that is subconsciously meant for us to use to excuse his actions.
Actually, we don't have any right to judge him. We're just strangers, walking and slipping through the internet. Not the one he hurts, or even someone related to this.  Above all, Lily forgave him and moved on, so why don't we just forgive him and let him become a better person? He didn't make excuses or hide about what he did, he accepted it and trying to move on. It's good, isn't it?  I really hope that you can turn yourself into a better guy, find another love (and don't repeat the mistake in the past ok?),  I want you to comeback with your violin and make great music for us, again.  Wish the best for you, Albert.  Sincerely.
I’m rooting for you.
You really go to the fastest way. The correct answer when one mistakes is just recognizing the wrong things and be brave to go to the best way at that point. This video shows the depth of yourself. I don't know what you did since I know you today. But even if I know something about you I can't blame anything about you since I also make mistakes. I just thank you for your video.
Did just put a sticker on a seal 500 lol?
I'm huge fan of lilypichu but I like this  video very much. Now, I just wanna make a video like this. I don't mean about what he is talking about. I just mean this video's quality. It is the best quality I have ever watched before 8 years. I am looking up you Albert as a content creator. I hope you will become good husband and boyfriend.
never come back lily is better with michael
Im sorry I know im late but I just noticed at 1:58 the things say fucking "Joe Mamma" and "ElonMusk21"
3 minutes in and this is sort of unrelated but I think it’s so cool how his parents had him play an instrument. My family never encouraged us in any musical things, sports, etc. so I’m kind of jealous of that
Cheating wasn’t a mistake, it coming out was 😅 but good to see him becoming a better person and trying to take accountability.
I hope the future has better things for you in store.
Bro really tried to blame cheating on depression, stfu
This is the stupidest shit ive ever seen
just dont cheat lol
I still dont like albert but no one gives a shit about that. Anyways, that shot at the beginning when he said he had hurt the people that close to him and it was a shot of lilies lying on the ground DAMN creative.
Support Albert on Twitch!!! :   https://www.twitch.tv/thealbertchang?sr=a
Damn this video is really fucking good.
At least he’s not fed
This is just a good video
Am I racist to think for some time now that albie was box box?
what a master piece.
I respect you for having a very mature outlook on this, and I hope you'll be able to achieve your goal. Props to you for being able to aknowledge that you need to own up to your mistakes, and letting yourself become a better person in the process. Looking forward to seeing you in the future in a much better light :>
Yo, that camera shots were amazing as hell, well done!  And ye, u fucked up, you lost a lot and U deserve a chance in your career. I bet Lily would not be happy if that shit you made to her, fucked u up for life. I'm glad that you made health decisions to change .
I can't stop coming back again & again!  It's the best work that you've done 'till the day!!
Sorry to be here a year later Yes I hate you but you do need to woke up and do what ever you need to do, to live Like my favorite magic card say "Life goes on"
I look up to albie, stop disliking him. Hes a good person whos learning from his mistakes.
Don't cheat then.
So basically he cheated, disappeared and made a video saying shits that doesn't relate to what he had done...? Nevertheless, this video is really well made and show how talented he is.
Some of you guys really love hating and rejecting an apology video, where you werent even involved personally in
I mean, i don't care what happens as long as people make content
What kinda trailer ass shit is this
I'm late and I know, And I'm also not the type of guy who gets into the drama, but you made a mistake that sure is unforgivable, But I've never thought you'd go through this much trouble for both of your life and mental health  Tho, I don't really care about whether accepting your apology or not, neither Be forgiven or not, but I'm glad you took the right path and stood back up with your feet again  All I'm saying, I may not forgive but I don't hate you either, you did your mistake and you absolutely regret it, but at least you sincerely apologized and let us knew you're doing fine with the new life you've built up  not to mention, you did much better on doing an apology than fed doing one
Thanks albert,i know you wont read this,but you gave me courage to start a new life.Thanks
Beautiful
Well at least you feel remorse Still a piece of shit though I respect you for owning it though
I see this happening to myself. In fact it already is happening to myself.
'A video for myself'  thats been professionally directed, produced, edited and posted on YT...Only 1 in 10 people dislike you now...time is clearly the cheating content creators friend... this is just a film you've had made where you figure it's been a year now so hopefully people will have moved on and I can start over...perfectly fine and understandable, but it just proves YOU STILL CAN'T BE HONEST IN YOUR MOTIVES...last time I saw someone with your personality they were still claiming they'd been cheated out of the Presidency...
Huge respect
5:30  For those wondering the song is  “it goes on” by Albie himself. And its actually my personal favorite song I’ve heard from him.
he did everything your friends told him to...  did he sigon hiz friendz nutz?
Quite a well shot video, love the look
bro this cringe
Cancel culture go brrr
I searched Albert Chang but it showed a Film Score Composer😅
cheating will always be a shitty thing to do but the fact that you owned up to your mistakes and didn't let yourself be defined by it forever says a lot. You taught me a lot
this is such an insanely well made video, regardless of what you did before. but the b roll, transitions and camera work are so well done. would be cool to see more stuff like this
Even though I’m late to this video I can definitely forgive Albert it has been a long time and I think he has learned and grown from it :)
ay at least he admitted it in a video and hasnt deleted it still a fucked up mistake he made
l0z3r
2:38 you cared about people?
Atleast he is honest and truthful in this apology unlike all the other "influencers" that deflect the blame on everyone else
ok
As a die-hard lily fan I don't think I'll ever get into watching Albert again. I respect where he's coming from and I wish him the best in his endeavours. Good luck man, hope therapy helps you like it's helped me and you become the person you wanna be.
Albert > Fed
I always come back to this video. I don't know why. It makes me kind of emotional and it has a quite the simple message "i messed up, and i don't want to be forgiven. I take my life back into my own hands". I want that. I have to do that. Find a job, a girlfriend, have fun
Albert, you’ll probably never see this but you really inspired me to try to improve myself, live for myself and take control of my life after I thought it was destroyed. Thank you.
I look forward to whatever comes ahead for you
you know albie i was never the person sending hate or trying to make you feel like the slimy slob of scumb like everyone else but i did feel sad because i genuinly loved you and lily together and you and the dinamic you give to otv and i also feel i detected a tint of anger towards you for making a mistake but at the end of the day we are all humans and not a single one of us has ever been perfect EVER so i am glad you made this video and if it means anything i am proud of you and the self discovering you have done  im happy for you :)
This is quite an exquisite creation, well filmed, well edited and most of all, well said.
5:09
for what you did, this is a well made video
Such a good fucking film well done with the script writing and editing im blown away!
I know how serious this is but this seems like the start of a movie, it's not bad just an interesting approach
This is incredible
Ok but u still u still haven’t said y you cheated on lilly
No matter what out of the 7 billion people in this world, people will keep supporting you!!!!!! <3
What you did is unforgivable, but I hope you can learn by your mistakes.
anyone who wants to know Albert and watch redemption arc with a lot of inspiration should watch these videos. It's very emotional journey for me that lasted 4 hours.  - start with this video - his first stream "Albert Chang aka SleightlyMusical's first stream back on Twitch" - Dr.K Interview "Moving Forward ft. Albert Chang" - his album "albie | reboot.exe [lofi album]"
I ain’t even gon cap da cinematography lit
we will forgive you if you beat mykull in arm wrestling haha jk
THE TWO OF WIVES? Excellent choice
so fucking manipulative
you've earned a second chance from everyone who's willing to give you one. you apologized for what you did wrong and have shown for actively trying to change your ways and better yourself as well as your mental health. i hope your journey from now on is filled with happiness and fortune.
Heyy :) hope you are reading this Albert.   It‘s been a while since you posted this video but i just watched it now. I recently started watching OTV and after watching all the good and entertaining videos i landed on watching all the videos about the drama that happened. The things that happened with Fed and the things that happened with you. It’s a fact that what you did wasn’t okay and that it hurt people around you but you are just human, we all are just human. Everybody makes mistakes some are small some are bigger. The important part is to learn from the mistakes and after watching this video i’m convinced you did. I can’t speak for the people involved but from my point of view i feel like they all managed to move on. What i want to say with this is “try to not be so hard on yourself”.  Anyways the MAIN MESSAGE here is: This video was dope in terms if video editing and filming and all. I would LOVE to see more videos where you can show your creativity. Your Song videos are pretty dope too but i would love to see videos where you use your camera and your creativity as an artist.  Yeaah the text got a bit long but i wanted to let you know what i was thinking :)
10 months already? Shit time is fast..
did anyone else search his name after the video ahhaha
I think lily forgave you 😁😁😁 plus I think it is not completely your fault 🤔 yes, you f* up but I think you just misunderstood your feelings when you made your mistake.😁😁 I'm not a psychologist but as you said you cared more about making people comfortable but you haven't made yourself comfortable😁😁 I know this a little because even though im an introvert I always made sure my friends have a smile left to show😁 even though im the one who makes the sacrifice🤣
almost made me cry
All that to find out his name isn’t Albert Zheng
Im sorry but this title is acopy
this video is art.
Comment
So you've noticed the lilies and Liberty Hill. But in case you've missed it, at 1:41 that looks like the lego statue of Liberty Albert built a few years ago with Lily.   When I saw that, I felt a mix of sadness, nostalgia and awe. A lot of thought was put into this video.
Make the proper changes to yourself can help how you act around others. Good luck.
0:48 to 0:54  watch this part Notice anything? Idk if it was intentional but :O
this is jjk and feds video is boruto change my mind
Not gonna lie, I searched up your name looking for some kind of gossip story. "Whatever happened to that guy?" I watched the entire video and found that it's not my place to judge, we all make mistakes and we all can improve with time.
so.... basically you spent the time collecting excuses and make a video to somehow justify your actions.... cool cool cool cool cool.
Y’all.. Ima be honest. Respect for Albert for actually taking his time and doing so quick and so truthfully. Honestly he just cheated on someone and he took the time to reflect on his decision. Honestly you don’t have to but, I believe he changed. It’s time for Albert to find happiness again. Either in an old or new way.
Weve all made intentional and unintentional  mistakes. All have. Its life. Nobody's perfect. I've seen and heard a lot. Your personal life is yours.
Anyone knows the name of the music that starts at 7:16
Just come back ..
make more cinematic videos like this, It's hella good, keep it up
he has absolutely no fucking remorse
20/10 video
The more I rewatch this the more I think about how this is one of the greatest comeback videos ever.
Here to cleanse my pallet after Feds god awful return
🤨
that was deep.
You're doing good, Albie. I hope you become happier.
This is so off topic but isn't the poster at 6:35 the same poster from boss baby back in business ( I have to babysit my siblings and I refuse to let them watch cocomelon so boss baby it is )
3:14 his dad kina looks like disguisedtoast
Shut up
forget the apology, this is a cinematic masterpiece.
So anyone can come back nowadays if you make some cinematic life coaching shit?
Honestly, nice.
amazing video
its not good what he did  but this video is edited very well
Only narcissists turn a camera on themselves to film how sad they are. On top of that, he put korean drama novelty on it.
Awe! I feel like you didn’t really like her to be honest. Maybe you just like her platform and that you find someone else you really is interested in. That the other person with the big platform you couldn’t really reject her because she successful and liked you. Honestly be true to yourself and your feelings. I’m not a fan of the big streamer their group seem kinda toxic as a person who used to stream it was toxic to health.
A really well done video 👍
yeah u really deserve it there's not too much to defend from you, maybe a second chance but... i still hate you, this is not a hate comment but karma is always at the shadow of someone.
I'm starting to like these kinds of videos, because they're not cheesy apology videos. Albert recognized what he did, and he recognizes what he can control so he started from there, and now he's trying be better. Best wishes and success in your growth and life Albert
Honestly, there's something very fake to me about this video. Now, I'm not saying he's being dishonest or insincere, but this cinematic format is inherently impersonal.   The words he says are true but they've been repeated over and over again while recording this that they've become laden with apathy. I think he should've just sat down, pressed record and started talking, nothing more.
Ya ummm, just watched feds… this is how to make a comeback, not feds
This shit is better to watch than fede by far lmao
Way better and sincere than Fedmyster's.
The like/dislike ratio here is much better than Fed's video. Seems like people are more forgiving when it comes to cheating than sexual assault
K...
anyone knows the song at 5:31?
I honestly don’t care , people are disposable Albert
Yo, your the guy that 'taught' me how to throw a card into an apple, I watched that VOD so many times to watch your technique from your shoulder to your elbow and forearm, thank you for teaching me. You are pretty dope even though that other shit happened, good luck man, most of all of will need some luck. :)
2:39 trickshot lol
back from fed's "apology"  this is betrer.
I'm back because of Fed's bs video :/
Inspirational
D
This is the best apology video/improving themself video I've ever seen.
Atleast albert made it clear he made this video for himself where as fed on the other hand...
whos here after fed pretty much took this video and replayed it on his channel
thank you for trying to forgiving urself<3 this was awesome
Yo wheres carsons one?
ily
I forgive you Albert.
I was already hooked the moment he held himself accountable (literally 18 seconds into the vid)
corniest video on youtube
Half of the reason this feels so genuine is literally just how much fucking effort he put into all the little details. Thoughtful, that’s what this video embodies. No wonder anyone trying to imitate this falls so flat
What a loser lmao
Bro cheated and made a movie about him LOL
A-tier apology video.
well this one is much better than fed KEKW
ngl man did comeback with quality
Forgiveness is a very powerful trait to wisdom.
At least this aged well
I've watched it many times because I find it extremely visually pleasing but today is the first time when I saw the "lily" reference.
Damn fed really did just steal this apology but stripped it of all the sincerity or creativity.
This video is like Fed's, but it's actually good and seems more genuine
Who’s here after seeing Fed’s discount version of this?
dont care lol
Yo Albert. You win. This is a much better video than Fed's.
hm
I dont really know about the drama but DAMN this is a high tier level of movie making
Now this is the way to do it, take notes fed
Its a lot better than fedmyster’s uni presey
Wow that was amazing
Sorry I'm a little late to this video, just wanted to share some thoughts. In around August of last year I started watching Lily's videos. When I had first found out about the drama surrounding albert I was angry. Angry and confused. I was for a while. Sometimes it was all I could think about. But then 2 months later this came out. I think not only did this video help me understand from his point of view, it was also 1 million times more useful than a bad apology video. I like how albert incorporated his love for filmmaking in it and acknowledged how hard life is and how it truly is a balancing act. much love & support to albert.
well i believe everyone can have 2nd chances so right now im gonna give you that chance so dont  fuck up anymore
Can anyone explain why he’s apologizing?
TRUST ME BRO I CRIED LIKE A FUCKING BASTARD. simply so damn relatable
why did i cry
Can't believe you break up with Lily, I thought you two were a perfect match. But I guess such is life, they're unpredictable at times. Great video, I love it.
If he was to make a movie I’ll 100% watch it just saying!
my man made a whole movie n shit bc he cheated on his gf and got repercussions from it 💀
Great vid but sorry to say your career will probably never recover
As much as came for the drama.  THE EDITING IS LIT BRUH.xD
ElonMusk21
i can say that is the best apology video a have ever seen
damn the editing tho
I feel like I am close from absolute rock bottom, but I still have high expectations and insane goals... this video helped me be my own therapist and thats exactly what I needed. Thank you so much
It’s wierd because I came back to rewatch this and when he talked about his grandmother a month later I lost mine and this is a wake up call to be closer to my family and I will be forever great full
Every now and then I rewatch this, nothing is more inspirational than change
Shouldve stayed gone
lily forgived him so i cant give a fuck. but he kept- avoiding saying what he did? he said "i fucked up" , "i made some mistakes" atleast tell what u did.  im sorry i cant take u sincerely if u cant even admit and say ur mistake out loud?  maybe im reading too much of this, i like the camerawork but id be disappointed if its all fake lol.  just to avoid any more repetitive discussions in here: i did not realize this isnt an apology video when i made this comment. someone brought it up and that is when i realized indeed there was no "sorry" or any bs. hence so this point is invalid.
This dude has me up at 3am about to put lofi music on and clean my room knowing I have Scholl tomorrow .. like ... Good Video .. also hope you come back and for everyone seeing this .. be a better person whenever you can and do the things you love ..also be yourself!
No wonder the Reboot.exe lofi was sounded so familiar I had a feeling it was from the video.
hopefully there is an alternate universe where i can see micheal, lily and albert be crackheads together
.
what he did still leaves a bad taste in my mouth but good luck on getting better! still wishing you the best.
i love how the road he was running across at 7:11 was called "liberty road"
•)-(•
Ok but can we just talk about how well made this is like this is just soooo good
U see theres nothing wrong about these "bad" people, it's just they're past that is.
bruh my eyes is sweating. i hope his doing well
Excellent production / editing, and a very thoughtful message, good work, thanks for sharing your life progress. A question, which keyboard do you use?
i'm so proud of you for doing this.
Sounds kinda like an excuse video to garner pity but its the smartest move from a business perspective so i gotta respect it
i like how he’s not apologizing. he already apologized to those he hurt and he doesn’t owe the audience anything.  cheers to moving on
Idk why I tear up watching this Hits so hard
Even if Albert did dumbass things he still holds himself responsible...Other youtubers have to use their fame for their advantage.He isnt even making those sappy apology videos He actually wants to be better and gain his friendship back. Thx for coming back a better person...
you are amazing
Omg, I hardly know you and I cried so much during this video. Why is this so fucking relatable to me. I got depressed since lockdown and this just motivated me🙂
damn fed could never do this (im sorry thats just a joke, very good work on the video and himself)
Thanks for your story. Its motivating.
Don’t listen to this guy. Literally everyone says different then him and he says that you can’t do what you love just because he couldn’t draw the line and is trying to subconsciously have us excuse him from the shit he did even just a little. Fuck off.
Thanks
I hate the internet because I already know that many people arent going to forgive you. Same thing with Fed, people make mistakes and lose friends in the process, but its so toxic and useless to keep going after these people. Imagine living a life where one bad decision can just end you like this, it isnt fair. I refuse to believe that everyone who does a shitty thing is just a one dimensional horrible person with no nuance. Its sick how onthe internet, a complex human being with emotions just as real as anyone elses, gets defined by and reduced to just the mistakes that theyve made. Let people grow and move on.
watching this for the third time and sobbing lmao, much love to you albert
Welcome back and I wish you success. This video inspired me to come back on my feet, I will always support you
Glad you seen your mistakes and are capable enough to own up and to take ownership of it and to learn from it. I hope you continue to take care of yourself and keep doing what you love. Wishing nothing but great things for you 💗
hMmmmM
Hey Albert, this was an amazing video! I only knew you from the music medley videos and nothing about the canceling. I also have recently been going through some things that severed relationships and definitely hurt people. This video inspired me to work on myself not only for myself but for the others who are unconditionally supportive of me. I want to thank you for making this video and hope you are doing well :)
I would Forgive you if I could but I’m not lily  Hope your doing good in life albie.
only a true man will have the guts to come back from his downfalls, be it just a trip-up or a horrendous fall. the community welcomes you back with open arms. keep rediscovering life albie.
Why is this so relaxing? I hope he's doing fine now; mentally and physically healthy.
I’ve never laughed this hard in my life
I personally love albert, I'm gonna support him until everything became alright place again. Love yourself albert!
I was just watching some offline tv vids and remembered this guy...
Damnnnnnñnnnnnnnnñ
this actually is amazing man, I'm proud of you. I've never heard of you before what happened and I don't deserve to sit here and judge you but you made the right call here and this video spoke to me a lot. Idk but this hit home.
Whilst this video is made by a person who messed up, this video is truly inspiring and bro this video quality is fire 🔥 his editing makes his video so interesting, this guy got some talent.
Damn, I feel you. I hope you have a great life
I can really feel albert rn. I've been accused of something I didn't meant to do, my old "friends" despised me and slandered my name so much that others think of me as that, I lowered my pride, apologized and left them (it was online in a server). I thought I was a horrible person yet this really helped me grow as a person and made me accept myself they called me shit, a nobody, tried to doxx me, made fun of my appearance but now? I dont give a fucking shit about them, i've made new friends and i've moved on from the problem they still mention me and try to reach out then make me feel shit but now i've let them go. So if you know someone who is willing to change? Help them, criticize them, accept them, support them. Be a fucking badass
2:40 the subtlety of having bojack horseman play on your tv while talking about how you distracted yourself from facing issues was a great little device to showcase the struggle you are going through. Bojacks struggle kinda reflects yours (self sabotages and distracting himself from facing his problems) and here's to hoping you improve better than he did.
I cried lol 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Haters gonna hate no matter what. That's just the life cycle they run with. Nothing they say can stop you from changing who you were then to now.
Yo I honestly almost cried watching this holy shit. I didn't really pay attention to what happened, I just heard that Albert cheated. You always see these shitty "apology" videos filled with fake tears and lies, but this is just pure, honest regret. Truly touching
Welcome back!
this felt like a 2 hour documentary
Bruh why is the cinematography on this vid actually cool.
Hope you can be the man you're grandma want's.
Never saw a comment section as respectable as this. This doesn't usually happen to someone who came back from getting cancelled, some would still hate or comment unnecessary stuff and make fun about the video. Like every statement is genuine and shows care to the video and the person.
to be fair, after watching this video from start to end all I could think of is "I don't know"   Lily moved on and some probably haven't, who knows  people in the comment section are either congratulating and so called "forgiving" Albert or still angry because of what happened,   did he deserve the hate? yeah, maybe to some degree I guess, why did I say yes? do you really think people would change if people had no reaction? if we did the world would be in a total chaos already does he deserve to be forgiven? Lily had moved on but forgiven? it's not my place to say nor assume, but for people who have been watching? personally, there's this unquenchable rage, undying hatred for this kind of evil(cheating), once I see a person cheat on their significant other I despise them til the end of time, til my last breath, everyone is entitled to their own emotions, their own feelings but to force their own opinions and feelings on others isn't right.  However, Albert goodluck on your career, please take care of yourself, I don't know you personally but what you did left a scar to many, some moved past it, some hold on to grudges, but you deserve a chance to prove yourself that your no longer the person you were in the past
Im not even gonna lie, this is actually relatable. Albert is pretty amazing for being confident enough to make this video.
Oh my god... what a beautifully written piece. This was really impactful.
You know what. I wish you all the luck. :]
Albert, I hope you’re doing just fine. I’m glad seeing you again.
People can't be perfect because people are profound, you can look deep into anyone and find an endless world. Change yourself by looking at your own world, discover what there is to change, then look deeper and change yourself again. It's never ending work, but it is worth doing.
still love u albie.
Lily forgave him......so you can to
damn, i dont even know who u r
NGL It was literally like 40 minutes ago when I found out about what truly happened and I was so mad at Albert so I checked his channel out to see what he’s doing now...  and man... I went from cursing him to rooting for him real quick. Damn!   This is a well-made video. Yep, our mistakes don’t fully define us so keep going, Albert! We’re human and I’m just glad to know you owned up to your mistakes.
A very well made video. Self growth is much more important than caring about people who doesn't even know you say negative stuff about you. Stay happy bro.
Hey Albert, you probably don't remember but you allowed me to use your cover of warriors for my own video all the way back in 2014. I still know you as a musician and since I lost interest in doing youtube I also lost track of you and your channel. So imagine my surprise when I randomly found out what happend in all this time. I don't realy know what happend exactly, I briefly looked it over but after all it doesn't matter. You've cleary grown and you have an amazing talent not only as a musician but also as a filmmaker. Both professions I aspire myself. I have the highest respect for you and want to thank you again for beeing so kind in the past. I wish you all the best for the future :)
Damn, this looks like the opening to a movie or something. Very well done
why does this feel cringy
I didn't see Albert before or during the cheating. All I see is this beautiful artwork and a truly sincere dude who has gone to hell and back. You deserve absolute no hate and I hope you reconnect with Lily and Michael
To think that I hated Albert, I never thought about what he feels and contained my anger on him. I was stupid that I still carry the disappointment while Lily is looking forward ahead, I am now disappointed in myself. Albert wanted to change for the best and that's the best thing I've ever seen, I want to help him rise and I want to support him not just as a fan but I want to support him as he make the happiness he wanted.
A lot of you are mocking and saying stuff like “hurr durr I cheated because of mental health issues now I need therapy.”  1.) He didn’t say what he talked to his therapist about, just his mental issues. But if you actually listened, he said most of his deprived sanity came from his switch from fun hobbies to work hobbies. It basically drained him. I’m sure he talked to his therapy about cheating, and I’m sure he didn’t say that he cheated because of mental issues, but he simply admitted to it and feels shitty.  2.) My point is further proven when constantly over the video, he is literally PUSHING himself over, calling himself shitty, self doubting, always mentioning that he fucked up. Whether that’s true self loathing or, pity digging, you choose what you believe. But the effort this video took, and everything he’s brought up and said, I think he’s actually trying.
You mightve done something wrong but thats okay, thats in the past, moving on is important<3 everyone makes mistakes some big, some small, but aslong as one moves on thats the past♡
6 months from the date of upload . I knew something happened between the otv drama and stuff but never cared today , I wanted to know what Albert was up to out of the blue . This made me cry no cap . I love him
PICK A CARD ANY CARD
I’m glad to see you’re doing well
Damn, didnt know this video would help me.. I have been struggling through a break up recently and relizing that self-growth is achiveable is so important and helpful
I love the cinematography of this video, but I just can't ever get myself to watch some one who has cheated. For me, that is one of the most unforgiving things a human can do. But I gotta admit the video is well done. Hope he creates more art. Goodluck.
honestly, people do stupid shit, it's how you move forward after that really matters
It's a whole cinema masterpiece, so much feels and hard work put into it🙏
hey albert, all of us have fucked up. some of us in addition to the knowledge that we've messed up, have the great misfortune of being dragged for it publicly. but time heals all wounds. and i hope that you're able to do better by yourself.💗
Everyone makes mistakes. And while that’s a bumper sticker kinda thing to say it’s true. I’ve done things I shamefully regret and wish I never did. And while I’ve never done something as bad as cheating, I can recognize that people deserve forgiveness for their mistakes. Keep moving forward, keep growing, keep changing, and keep making yourself better. Also, this video actually was insightful to me because when I hear about celebrities getting cancelled I sometimes have the “oh boohoo rich person sad” response. I’ve posted telling people to go cry into their stacks of cash before. But I didn’t actually realize that Albert isn’t some huge streamer or content creator, he isn’t rich. And I guess that changes things kinda.
Beautiful, inspirational video. I wish you peace.
Good lord this video is incredible
I cried.....
I genuinely am happy to see/watch this.
and when u search "albert chang" good: Albert Chang is a former professional tour TENNIS player.
For what it's worth, as a lily fan, I forgave you a year ago
Watching this back again and it still feels like a biography of a character you'd meet at the beginning of a movie like Scott Pilgrim.
im proud of him. thats all i have to say. ik it was his fault everything turned out like this and he knows it too. however, he made a whole cinematic masterpiece for us to let us know he's evolving as a person and getting slowly better in his mental state as before he was in a very bad place. this is way better than just a shitty apology video with fake tears. and as far as ik, lily has forgiven him long ago. so if lily can forgive him even though he hurt her badly, then we can forgive him too. so albert, welcome back.
gay
i loved this video, very good views and it made me think about myself too
Not only was this such a powerful video in all aspects, its good to know that he pulled himself out of that dark hole and is trying to restart from scratch, fully knowing he cannot completely fix something he himself shattered, good on you Albert, and good luck in your endeavors.
I’m honestly proud of Albert for changing and discovering himself
This is well done and the people here are nice did not expect that lmao
pseudo intellectual trash
Mans so talented how can I not forgive him
If Lily can forgive you so can we. Welcome back
Lol dude we r so same but im in process of becoming u but a little different but idk wht to do
Lesson: Girls aren't toys, they have feelings, emotions. They aren't soulless dolls that you can cheat on.
He looks like lilly pichu's old boyfriend
u can tell that he is really talented
I still don't like you but whatever
This was so fucking cringe 💀
The part about the yeast is hilarious 😂🤣
yeah your a gamer you played lily
I dont even know who you are
Yow can you check bible for God just check it out a little.
This is kinda inspiring.
are we gonna talk about how he put a lily when he said "many other people closest to me"
esse video ficou do caralho
Felt this.
Nice
I know that this is suppose to be a serious video but... he uses twitch light mode
RAULLLLLLLLLLLLLL
dangg how did he get that high quality camera
poor lily she deserves better 🥺
Yes this is a serious video, but 1:54 Joe momma
You're a good man.
dude posted this and just left
I like coming back to this every now and then, it's actually thereputic
Regret builds character.  Everybody, and I mean everybody, has done something in their life they wish they could forget.  Especially those who insist on throwing stones. There is no greater forge of genuine courage than the crucible of shame.  As for being cancelled - that's up to you.  An audience awaits and we're not all that interested in judging you.  For, as you have learned, the only judgement that matters is your own.  Meanwhile, speaking as one member of your audience, I'll be here if and when you decide to play.  As for the heat -- let me offer this: words spoken face to face count.  The rest is just ASCII.  You don't owe me or anyone else on the Internet a damn thing.  But it would be nice to hear you play violin again.
Can someone tell me how the mix of his personal life and work lead to cheating his girlfriend?
I just realized he changed his YouTube channel name to represent that he changed and to show his new found identity
In someways, we cancelled him. It is somewhat also an apology to us for disappointing us viewers. Nevertheless, a 2nd chance is important to have. If you have no 2nd chance, you'll suffer forever. Let Albert live. As a Catholic, Jesus said that whoever has no sin may cast the first stone. We all have made mistakes in our lives, some worse then others, but taking away his career and with that maybe his life too, we aren't going to be any better than him before his change. Let's support him and keep the past in the past. Only then can a man show how he really changed.
this comment section looks filtered / altered, like the negative comments were deleted
1:28 finally someone understands it
it's all about you. man...
Love the music, but man this cinematography is sick. Its so good, I have watched this video so many times in the hopes I myself can learn from this masterpiece. Thank you
This is a good video, Albert. Pull yourself together...
Ok i will forgive you so please Don't disappointed me and everyone who Support you
forsenCD Clap
plot twist, it took him a year to make this video
n word
You have shown so much improvement and I hope the “certain person” accepts your apology because of how much you have grown
4:12 balisong videos when, nice naut btw
what he did wasent good but it wasent horrible seriosly he got way to much hate i still dont like him but he got way to much hate
Yo I respect you so much for what happened like, Keep going man dont let people tell you anything because they were not apart of what happened. I love you and there's only one way to go and it's up, Stay strong Albert👍🏽
I wish Shane Dawson will reflect to his mistake and do the process of admitting, healing and return like Albert does. We fucked up in life, those YouTubers/Streamers got everybody watching it online, that makes it 10000000x harder than it already is. I fully respect Albert's growth here -- and actually reflect to my own self. Thank you Albert, welcome to YouTube.
i watch this over and over. just learning the art. scene by scene. thanks albert
Do whatever you want if you messed up take responsibility ask for forgiveness and try your best to better and you did it take longer break if you must, be happy
Life is all about moving forward, as long as you learn from the past mistakes, that is the important part. you may not e ale to change the world. but you can change yourself
You improved damn good
Good luck dude I hope you well get better.
holy what a cinematic piece good job!
2:25 " I slept 8 hours a day" Thats a good thing bruh.
I almost forgot to watch this today.
I know dat I'm late to the party but welcome back Mr Chang
ok setting the drama aside, this vid is an asmr vid you cant change my mind
Genuinely didn’t think I was gonna watch this all the way through. It was very beautifully done. You did what you did and you regret it. Now your gonna work to erase the “Albert is a cheating asshole” image. I hope your future is bright! And I’m so sorry for your loss!
I’m rewatching this and I just realized he lost 200k subs
bruv my OCD!!!!!!!!!
This isn't a redemption arc in a show, it's not character development, it's a man admitting guilt and wanting to rebuild a ruined lifestyle.             Over the past year we have all been through rough patches, school, work, family, social life, etc. As much as my friends jokingly call me a "hipster" or "snob," coffee has been a point of control in my life. Something I can do with my hands and create a sufficient product with. I'm proud of the coffee I make and, at first, the precise measurements I went through to brew the perfect cup were holy ratios and sacred texts. When someone asks for a cup now, I find myself no longer worrying about whether or not I think it will be the absolute best coffee they have ever had. I find that the perfectionist in myself will allow me to make coffee for others without worry. I still don't know why. Maybe I've mastered it (although I know I haven't). My own tastes are satisfied with it. As each day passes, I've been allowing myself to mess up here and there, as it may lead to a different profile. I thought early on, this was just a passing hobby I'm getting way too into on account of my addictive personality. Instead, I find that I feel better after each cup brewed. It doesn't just feel like the latest hyperfixation, I can move at my own pace. I don't have to have top of the line equipment or watch 100 videos to find the perfect brew. I drink what I like and experiment with new things as they come to me.            To anyone reading this, I hope you're doing well. I hope you can find it within yourself to forgive but never forget. If we forget the experiences of the past we may never remember to forgive in the future. I'm no sage, nor will I pretend to be. I'm simply a man who will one day admit to his own guilt, and attempt to rebuild a ruined lifestyle he once knew. It may be something as small as skipping out on my gym day, or not finishing coursework on time. I may also royally screw myself by cutting off ties with a family member, or wishing upon someone's downfall only for my wish to come true. Whatever it may be, we will all constantly be rebuilding and learning from our mistakes. There is no reason to forget, but there will always be a reason to forgive.  If you are still here, thanks for reading. Please, have a wonderful day, and work towards forgiveness.
I don't know anything about Albert but this video is so amazing and inspiring.
hes really hurt...damn
when their there today doesnt mean there gonna be there tomorrow.
This Asian always so serious from the start of the vid😆👍 Good luck with the new start bro
Hey and welcome back.. hope you could do well today in your comeback
Holy shit, this was inspirational.
There are many people that have done what Albert did. Many don’t feel remorse for it. Many don’t apologize for it. Today many people shame each other for their past regardless if they changed. Personally, I think Albert changed and learned from his mistakes. We need to stop trying to this “cancel” culture we have become accustomed to. Majority of the time it’s none of our damn business. None of us are perfect, but that’s what makes us... US. Albert I’m not sure if you’ll see this, but I hope the best for you. Take care of yourself, man. (Ik this is very late but still)
just noticed that you put a lot more video on Twitter than here, really hope to see more videos from you. Everyone all had fucked up here and there in their 20 and/or 30s, glad to see you again on twitch. carry on!
0:58, Albert wrote a letter to chat. Sharing because if he put it in there he probably wants some people to read it. @Albert the only issue I took with this letter is you beginning sentences with "And". Best of luck in your redemption arc.   A: Hey, I've missed you so much. All of you so much. Its been what...Half a year at this point? But come on, really? You're pausing this video to read what's on this piece of prop paper? Do you get off on internet drama at the expense of actual human beings who don't have the support structures and PR teams to handle these kinds of shitty situations? Dealing with these matters privately is difficult enough as is, let alone having internet armchair psychologists scrutinize every interaction you've ever made and every word you've ever said, without having any of the meaningful context.  C: Then give us the context! So, we can go decide if we want to wave our pitchforks at someone else.  A: No one owes it to you. Imagine everything you've ever done in your life and may potentially do in the future. Is it a realistic expectation that you'll never fuck up, that you'll never hurt people you care about? We're all just human beings that inevitably will do stupid shit at some point in our lives. All we can hope to do is to own up to it, accept the consequences, and move forwards. And if it's strictly a personal matter, then it's none of your business.  C: Fine. Then fuck you. You fucked up and hurt a lot of people that we support. That makes you a terrible person. Forever.  A: ********t that. I can guarantee you no one hates me more than me. It's only taken half a *************n of therapy to even get myself back to a normal operating state again. I keep *******g through my self-loathing and public hate or kill myself (which i'm sure would make a lot of people happy based on comments I've received). But there's still too ******** *******************et if this is the end of my story, so I'm starting over in many ways. If *******************pport me, that's your choice. If my actions from here on outwards change your opinion of me, then move right along. Go live your life. Clearly, we w******* *****************d that's okay.  ***************** is this isn't a reality TV show. There are no producers. There are no actors. There are no scripts. We're all bad at faking our emotions, so anything that happens feels more *******n a reality TV. You get direct access to our thoughts, our feelings, our personal lives. And the amount of mental fuckitude that does to one's psyche is hard to qualify. So when we succeed, the high is exhilarating, but when we fuck up, the fall is soul crushing. We online content creators are for the most part, normal human beings that have learned to be vulnerable and open to people who we hardly know. Which makes it easy to hurt us as well, even if we don't outwardly show it.  A:So as someone who has nothing left to lose and nothing left to hide, feel free to speculate, gossip, shit-talk, or whatever helps you fill the emptiness you feel in your actual life, because for the first time in my life, I've accepted who I am and what I want to do. Whether you continue to follow my journey or not doesn't matter to me
Sometimes I come back to watch this. It's beautiful
You deserve your comeback, Albert. I’m praying that people treat you better.
no shitty excuses, no attention-seeking fake apology. Somehow very on-point and authentic, i think this is well-made and i wish you the best
jesus people, those 9k humans who disliked you guys are heartless
Good on you mate... Even though LilyPichu is my favourite streamer, but the person who broke her heart is not you anymore. Both of you grown. At least, you got the balls to face it... Better than walking a path of self-destruction.
lol
I dont believe mistakes, I believe in choices. But sometimes you can make crappy choices and its important to make that right. I hate cheating but its evil as how much love you take. What I mean is everbody thinks something but thats doesnt give you the right that interfere someones live. Job life and personal life is too different and that why cancelling people is just bullshit. I hope we can wake up to a morning that everybody minds his own buisness and who makes crappy choices can solve it personally with that person.
you make me cry
Thats some good shit.
Holy Sh**, This was really well shot and very powerful. You have my utmost support and I have subscribed to your channel. I didnt know you well as a content creator during offline tv but you can be sure that I know you well now.  I have never seen such a powerful reflection of self as i have seen today.   Good Luck, you can be sure that you have one more fan than you did before.
Omg this is amazing
five months later, and this video still slaps. its really inspiring, congrats
I feel bad he had done regrettable things but he has been forgiven by who he has hurt and he did things to hurt others and himself but he should not hunted on social media but given a second chance
Yeah, i felt that...
I've seen many people who were determined to change their lives. Some kept it up for almost a year, others didn't even last a month. Since then, I don't believe that people can change. The only thing you can change are the people who're surrounding you and the environment you live in. Control what is influencing your life.
Rauuuuulll 🎵 gillette 🎵 the best a man can get 🎵
cant agree with cheating on his part, but honestly, lilly is happy, mykull is happy, albie is happy-ish (and doing what he can to get help, get better and move on) and slowly but surely everyone is startig to forgive, messing up so bad and trying to make up for it is ever easy but i am glad to see albie getting back on his feet again and i do wish him the best, as long as the pst stays in the past and albie doesnt give up then what more can we really ask, unlike other people albie is actually trying to get better and fix HIMSELF and NOT the past, learning from it so he doesnt repeat it  go albert! you got this dude!
8:55 mark?
champion?
This is some quality content. I’m glad you’re in a better place Albert! ☺️
Fking amazing video so happy your back!!
I fked up too and whenever I feel down and hit rock bottom, I always come back to watch this video and feel so inspired to be better
i have no idia ho you are or ho you where but i wish i can change like that
I love this introduction to your new beginning. I was the opposite of you, in terms of how my relationship ended. I fell into severe depression after my ex-girlfriend of 4 years cheated. After a year of mourning, I decided that I won't let the pain of my past dictate my future. I started a similar journey as you, but I deleted my social media (excluding YouTube) in the process. I feel a lot better working on myself and living in the moment.  Although, I have decided to subscribe to you because I rather support you on a new journey than dwell on the old one.
I don’t understand this but ok
why is everyones excuse for cheating their "mental health"
O

poor egg , he got mixed to the pancake mixture :(
:(
Man, I only discovered OfflineTV recently, but, after doing a lot of digging, I intend to follow your projects too. This is well made piece. Good on you, man. You exemplified in this that the only play that guarantees failure is quitting, and you have not quit yet. Keep playing, Albert. I'll be watching.  Thanks for this. I know it was for you, but it's helped me too.
respect brother
I’m not ok with him cheating but I think it’s weird he got canceled for it. Especially since there are youtubers who are legit predators and still have a platform and large fanbase. Cheating on a significant other just doesn’t seem like something you should get basically kicked off the internet for.
So, I'm a bit late to this and I just wanna say my part. I became a fan of Lily's when among us grew large. I found out about her breakup with Albert a couple months ago. This video is amazing in both ways. He isn't giving excuses for what he did and also the cinematics are amazing. The thing is, he didn't hurt you so you aren't the one who decides to accept the apology or not. Lily forgave him and moved on.
This was truly captivating
Honestly, this might be the best thing you've ever done
im scared because he overwatered the suculant. 10:44
Is no one going to talk about the amazing camera work and symbolism put into this
So much unnecessary 🎭   Your mistake was getting into the spotlight too close.
I hate you bitch how dare you hurt lily
good
In other words he's hinting at all those people that can't calm their minds to see a therapist and fuck off bc he's a grown adult and he now knows what he did wrong so don't blame him because he's also human.
Literally cried watching this. It's difficult being a content creator because you always find the need to please others that you end up depending on those others' validation for your own happiness. Although it's helpful to have some encouraging comments from strangers, you have to find happiness & meaning in the work that you do and the life that you live. I find it helpful as well to stay off the internet for a while and just take a break to introspect. It's important to not just put a specific type of content just for more views and revenue all the time. That can really destroy your happiness and make you forget why you are doing what you are doing. Really enjoyed this powerful message. I'm glad you're finding strength and courage to change for the better.
4:38 i just relize that was miidle finger
Watching this video you'd think he shot up a school or something
Exceptional quality video, and even greater message. You got a subscriber
Damn!! You are a filmmaker
some of you act like he committed mass genocide
i wish you the best, albert.
I believe in you, Albert. Welcome back.
I'm having a hard time why people are giving Albert shit rn. I get it, I personally hate people who cheat, but none of us were involved in this. When the person who has been cheated on forgives the person who cheated, how could we, the people who are not involved whatsoever, be mad.
Just found out about this bro I'm happy your back I loved all your stuff even tho lmaooo I'm kinda new
this is a very random comment but a random lady from the internet  that want to tell you that I really respect the effort you put in this video, context aside, the video is well put together, the angles, the editing, the effort can definitly be seen and I just wanted to say that I really appreciate it. (ps the message can be felt in a much more sincere way with all those considered and ofc i'm just a random person on the internet that is neither a fan nor a hater, just a regular person.)
all the best man, tbh i didnt know anything about the drama and only recently discovered offline tv. but you have a subscriber who will watch every upload without judging. loved the your music video btw.
Only watched a couple of minutes but this was pretty gay
Hey damm dude u had some tough times i hope i can see more content
I don’t know this man but this cinematic masterpiece hits me
gillete
Hope you’re doing better, Albert!
I believe in you albert
What
wow when I clicked on this video I did not expect it to be this good. You sure regret what you have done, and it's important to forgive yourself. We all make mistakes, it's how we learn. We cannot change the past but we can always  work to make a great future. Don't listen to all the people hating on you, noone is just good or jsut bad.
I’m still disappointed in you, but you are very talented. I’m sure you’ll continue to do well. Please do well by the people in your life, in turn.
Welcome to the Champions Club
I never knew much about Albert besides the fact that he cheated on one of my favorite twitch streamers, Lily, so I've always seen Albert as some degenerate asshole who lacked any sort of empathy. Now, idk about anyone else, but after seeing this video, I've kinda opened my eyes. Albert's actually a lot more self-aware than I thought. He's working towards bettering himself and it's not just for show but really for him. This is the first time I've seen someone make a quality self-improvement update video rather than a cringe tear-jerking apology video, and it honestly says so much about this guy already. I send you my best regards on your path to recovery and success, Albert.
Sounds like he got exactly what he deserved, nice
Failure Give you 50% Success, it's up to you if you want it. If you ask yourself and you say "Whats wrong with you." And you get an answer and the person hates you agree to that answer, Congratulation you manage to Move one step again.(not physically tho)
This is honestly so much better than those cliche fake tears apology videos
Hey man. I hope you come back. I dont know what you did but come back fo sho
People do some messed up stuff, but hey, at least they change, they try to improve.
Simply put; Excellent.
RESUBBED.
2:32 try drugs
your visuals match your content. it is very hard to do, and you have to think of what image fits every line. kudos!
It’s crazy because none of the viewers will ever be friends with lily yet the internet behaving as if she’s their own child. She forgave him, so should you. There’s no point in continuing the hate. He messed up, he recognized it, he apologized for it, now he’s trying to fix his life. So instead of exiling him, lets hope him the best on fixing himself. If y’all are so angry for what his old self did, why would you want to keep him as his old self?
I was a big fan of yours back in the day, I really really identified myself in your work. I even started learning the violin because of you. And after what you did what you did I was genuinely disgusted.  But I don't want you to be depressed and I was really pissed when I saw you being treated as you were. Hell, even she forgave you, who were I not to forgive?  Everybody makes mistakes, some bigger than others but we all need to be wrong sometimes to learn to do right.  I'm looking forward to your future work and recognition. Keep loving.
I started sleeping 8 hours a day. Only an asian would think thats a sign of depression.
Lol
I don't know, I hate this video
so I only watched OTV because of Jae of Day6 then somehow got hooked. I saw Lily and Michael then later learned Albert used to date before cheating on Lily. I wasn't there for the trip so I didn't think much of it, but genuinely this video made me shed some tears. I loved how beautifully shot it was and that Albert is fixing himself. As people say, learn from your mistakes and it seems Albert's doing so.
Everybody makes mistakes and he even says that he truly regrets for being selfish and hurting lily and others, but tbh everyone deserves a second chance to fix their mistakes and i hope people dont hate him much cause that might be putting pressure on his career. Hope you're doing okay tho Albert (Albie;)) plus that cinematography is just *chef's kiss*
This video helped me gain more perspective and for that I thank you
get well broo
lmao people cheat all the time why was this a big deal anyway
Beautiful
yeast ❤
albert man your so fucking inspirational bro idgaf what people say. keep doing you❤️thank you for helping me
Damn what a nice video man <3  What camera are you using and what lens pls! I need to know! Damn bro!
Here for you man
My Albert strong, he broke an egg with one hand
The music used is really good, I wished he linked it
10:05 music?
3:54 a quotes for my self.  dont mind it random stranger on the intrtnet.
This is a really well shot video damn
I use to think Albert was just a huge dick because he didn’t say or do anything for over a year but know ik y and this vid was better then some have ass apology that normal ppl do that y I can say with confidence he has change
Videos like this make you realise more about life and wisen you up.
There's so many people in the spotlight who've made a lot of mistakes in the past, for example X and everyone forgave him for what he did over the years because he was changing for the better. How would this be different? Lily already forgave him and moved on. Albert understands his mistakes, he's doing his best to improve himself and become a better person. PEOPLE CAN AND WILL CHANGE! Much love to you <3
I really want u to say scrw off but I just can't, pls NVR do that to anyone again :(
Ik he cheated on lily and I’m not a fan of him but people have feelings and people make mistakes at least he learn from the mistake he had done thank u for reading if u are!!!?!!?!??!?!?
This is a very well shot video
I’m still not fond of him, but I’m glad he’s reflected and is trying to do better. Here’s to learning & growing🤝
7:43 this aged poorly...      because he just got a puppy as he's in a new house!
It’s fine man we learn from mistakes
the production quality of this video is epic tho
say what you will but you've got to admit he's a great filmmaker.
So glad to see this isn’t a shitty non genuine video. You genuinely took the time to better yourself and it really seems like you’ve changed. Plus this video was a cine-fucking-matic masterpiece. Welcome back, hope to see more of you soon❤️
I'm happy that you are here again .. i love your videos .. I usually say yes just to make people happy too I don't know why .. mostly i end up alone when people get what they want .. anyways I'm really happy that you are doing good .. I'm sorry for your grandmother lost .. I have a good friends too but I wish I had friend like you .. I'm trying to learn an instrument is the Violin good to start ?
CHEATER
the best people who know right, are the ones who did wrong.
holy shit the cinematography is fucking amazing, I don't know you as a person so I'm not gonna judge you but seems like you're actually changing for the better. this video was actually fucking great wow.
you're not the main character
coryxkenshin vibes
Albert I am glad you have changed 💘😉
These communities are so quick to condemn people who they don't even know personally or know all of a person's situation. Sitting behind the screen obsessing over other's lives and talents. Meanwhile doing, experiencing and being surrounded by the same thing they condemn for. I guess it's a price of being in the public eye. Everyone is holier than God from the comments section and chat I guess.
i love my 奶奶 too
This is so well made its crazy, well done man
Late as fuck but I’ll get to it. I never forgive, I’m one of those people. I thought your Twitter apology was half-assed because you got caught, but seeing this changed my mind. Cancel culture is so toxic when they threaten you and tell you to kill yourself. After watching this I see that you’re one of the few people who doesn’t give petty excuses and actually tries to get help. I respect that.
Socrates thought that if you do something unjust, your souls gets harmed, not just others. Nice to see him recovering.
I Just Looked For The Youtuber Flamingo, But I Found This, And I Can Say The Apology Was,.. Perfectly Acceptable, You Need To Take a break When You Want To Just Keep You're Fans Up To Date And If You Want To Take A Break Do It And Make a short Video unedited Or Post On Yt If You Want To Make A Video For youre Fans just Try Not To Over Work Yourself And Do It No Force Needed And I NEED To Aay This: Im Sorry For You're Loss, Someone You Loved Is Now Gone But We Wont Forget Her, but Deep In Our Heart She Still Remains As A Memory We Won't forget Rest In Peace Albert Mother I Hope You Have A Happy Afterlife And is The End Of This Comment And I know This Is 3 Month's  Outdated But Its Alright
God loves you. And doesnt abandon you. Hevwill help you cure
3:52 facts
Actually the best apology video ever.
Thousands or maybe Millions of People make such Mistakes EVERYDAY and dont do anything about it. Nobody gives a shit. Then there is Albert who makes this Mistake and really regrets it and apologises for it and People hate him and send him Death-Threads. What the Fuck is wrong with you People?
Well done video.
:(
Albert should be a director, this is amazing.
This is actually a quality video. Love this.
Good luck. From one coffee lover to another
Albert is the song at 10:05 something off your new album? I'm digging it
It might be little but thanks for making the aspect ration 21:9, it's been a while since I experienced true full screen on a YouTube video. I disliked you when shit was going downhill but I think you regained my respect as I see a lot of myself in you. I hope you will notice me following you in the future. This video has been quite inspirational. Keep working hard.
0:43 honestly, the most heartbreaking thing
This was so good it made me cry
ur a human humans fuck up no matter what thay say ur a 1 human beng and thats all that matters u can be messd up 1 day...... and butiful the next year ur not messd up ur like a glass broken...... not like glass..... it can reepard......... work on ir self and i ant gona say it will get better GOD KNOWS AINT THAT EZ but it can get       .  ezer ur cool keep it up :)
This is a great video. Good job Albert.
I've only been following the whole OTV fam for a month and had recently found out about you. I've heard a couple of things and was curious when i saw this vid of yours. I then preceeded to check out a different video instead about the timeline of everything that happened to you and the others but got so confused  instead with the whole context of that vid so i then tapped yours. I was actually expecting a mediocre 'sorry' from this video but instead i got to see a story told genuinely by a man who is working hard not to redeem himself to and for the public but to find himself and chase after his true happiness. I'm glad i saw this. I'm glad you're getting the help that you need. I'm glad that you are working hard to 'gain' but most importantly, I'm glad you exist.    Nobody's perfect but everybody should opt to be "a work in progress.". As REBECCA SUGAR would say. And i say this is a very good example to that.  Hope your doing fine and wish you all the best on your endeavors.
you're a great person Albert . I will always support you no matter what happen :)  Cheer up!
Albert just watching OTV videos had me. Liek biiiijs.
ngl the first time that i heard about that drama and what happened it really pissed me off...it's 3 month late but now after this video i realized yeah that was a mistake and it can happen to anyone but the important thing is how you dealt with it i kinda had same experience but it was about drugs...after 2 year of wasting my life i decided to pull myself together and i did the same thing you mentioned all i want to say that i'm happy for you and i hope you continue this lifestyle  you have my sub man
I swear to you every second gets me on the verge of tears 😢
The difference between him and other content creators is that he owns his mistakes. Didn’t try to push it away and bury it to make people forget and salvage himself. He took his mistakes and held them close to truly feel them. And then he learned from them. It taught him about himself. The most dangerous of thunderstorms still water the flowers. I am in awe at the sabbatical and evolution. Much respect. Stay blessed.
This piece was extremely beautiful. It's one thing just creating a half-hearted apology video and the other is this. This shows that you, Albert are growing from this and seeking help. And that takes a lot of courage to do. And the self-growth is astounding in this video. For the people that came here just to flame Albert or just dislike his video without actually watching it, are you children? If Lily was able to forgive Albert for what he did and move on and you are not, you are children. I wish you the best in 2021 Albert!!
To get mean texts is mean, people act like they never cheated we all know people go though things and mess up its human life but wat I seen in the video was that he was apologizing for wat he did lily already forgave him so people shouldn’t be sending such mean word
You said it best man Mistakes don't define you its what you do after, take time for yourself bro I believe in you.
This is so great. Sometimes you need to set aside the society's whims and prioritize yourself. You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. Find happiness cause I know that you deserve it despite of the mistake you have done.
ma hart
This video honestly was so well put together and the entire time i was just in awe at the amount of thought and effort that was put into this video because the story he told and the imagery that he presented was just so wow. I truly was moved by this and not a lot of people are able to admit their mistakes and reflect on themselves with their goals being to improve their own self. So this video is inspiring because it also made me want to look deep within myself and reflect because everyone has done something in their lives they weren't proud of and it is indeed what you do afterword that is important. I really enjoyed it.
Pls just be happy and don’t listen to them.
I found this video after seeing his comment on a collab cover he did with Lily (yikes)... but man this was interesting, emotional, inspirational, and makes just wonder "huh, he did something like that. but can I?". Loved the great use of filmography which made this video incredibly more entertaining. He does seem to be a bit humble since I do believe that the progress he's presenting does give off that there is so much than what he's giving himself credit to. Best of luck on being back on the platform!
I really enjoyed the video, your film making skills are really good and talented. I found myself relating to the dark parts  too, my grandmother passed away from suicide and I couldn't say any last words or spend anymore time with her. I am glad that your nai nai is loved and cherished. I am glad that you did not succumb to the social  media pressures and not develop suicidal tendencies, it was really difficult being alone and I hope that you will gain a new friend/fan base who appreciates your work and not judge you on your personal life.  I find myself watching the old otv videos because I found that your editing/filimg was enjoyable and unique. I am glad that you are back and I am looking forward to more creations! Thank you for being alive and staying safe Albert.
I'm a new fan of OTV and all of its members, particularly of Lily and ma boi Reeves....but when I found out about what had happened and done some digging, I was at first sad at such a thing ever happening to Lily, but also respected how Albert took full responsibility for his actions, publicly, even if it meant fueling the flames of cancel culture by a landslide.......when I watched this video, I really saw how Albert truly felt about the whole situation, and how he recognizes his mistakes, and really took initiative and took steps, one by one, at his own pace, to recover and become a better person than he was.  What happened was very depressing and disappoint but Lily has already forgiven him and there is no reason to stay stuck on whatever happened before, as Albert is also taking steps to improve himself and to move past what he'd done and what had happened.  Stay strong Albert, and I hope next time I search your name, I'll be scrolling through pages about your new videos and releases
This was very enlightening. As someone else said, this goes way farther than any apology and i wish you the best. Thank you aswell for inspiring me.
I mean im not mad at Albert! He pretty much helped get Lily and Michael together so im not complaining! Im super happy!
the video so cringe
SUBSCRIBE SUBSCRIBE SUBSCRIBE
Just wanted to say thanks! I'm going through a lot right now and this video kinda helped to become more hopefull! The video itself was also great! Thanks and I wish you the best!
Lily lied to Michael in Among Us anyway. Dunno why she’s allowed to when you weren’t. Smh
This was amazingly shot. Made me tear a bit ngl. This shows that people can change from mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes all the time, some worse than others. But what we have to do is learn from them and better ourselves. We can still hate ourselves and etc, I know because I still hate myself for things I've done but we can't do anything about it than to move forward.
Sh*t happens.. keep moving forward. Were all humans we make mistakes.. i Salute to you.  Keep making things you love. These are just words i thought to encourage you.  Ps love the video!! Your amazing keep it up ☺️
this is like a documentary but better.
sorry to hear what has happened to your grandmother. hope it doesnt bring you down too much. :)
I wish ypu good luck :)
The directing of this video is why he took a year to come back
For some reasons, I find this video inspirational✨
As much as I hate cheaters, being cheated on three times in a row myself, I understand that people change over time. Since I was not in this situation personally, I can’t really be upset with you for your past actions. That being said, I’ll support you and hope you only grow more in the positive direction you’re going in. Good work, Albert. I proud that you’re bettering yourself.   Side note: this film was really well made!!
Hope you're back for good.
I'm really happy for Albert, for what he has done to help himself, you are a great bro
Now this, I love this
Those flowers are the same as the one on lily pichus channel art
You fucked up and i watched it all and seeing how you took time to actually grow and fix yourself and not do a *sigh* and then que bullshit apology. I'm proud of you man, Keep that head up and continue growing.
One of the best Apology Video!
This is an apology video I can get behind
I'll support you,i hope you become better than before
Now we need to bring Sarah bsck, she deserves a comeback too
I hate you albert for hurting lily but if you could do something good I'll forgive you. You cheating bastard
I don’t know you I was just shocked to find out you were cheating so blatantly when you’re such an ugly mong
Thank you I really don’t know you at all until today, but a lot of the things you said during this video really I could resonate with the cancelled, cheating, etc. it was an amazing journey really seeing everything played out it was like seeing my own journey through your film! I’m happy to say I’m also on this path with you as well and have strived greatly in personal growth, I hope the same for you! I’ll keep in touch, you have me as a loyal subscriber, I can’t wait what’s next for you, Albert Chang.
F's in chat for yeast boy
This is like the beginning and the end of a movie love dis
8k dislike HOLY SHEET dude
The person winning isn't the one who won, it's the person who is having the most fun
Not lying, nice video.
just do what u want to have fun
lalala
i like this.
What a beautiful video. Made me giggle and tear up. I'm a new fan but I know the drama. I don't think its fair for people to hold grudges against you when she already forgiven and moved on. Wish you best of luck in becoming who you want to be. I like you music too so ill stick around.
you and sarah had some real chemistry tho, just remember leann rimes did something similar but she showed the setback just makes for a greater comeback!
really crying bc of this @ 3 am ;-;
Hi I saw this video today and you made me get emotional this is the most beautiful piece of artwork. Thankyou
Hey man, Logan Paul wasn't matured back then but guess what he came back owning up his mistakes and learned from it.  Life moves on and I really believe you can be a better than someone in the past.
I- I almost cried 🥺🥺
I think this is the right step foward for Albert. He put a lot of effort into this video and I think he put even more effort in reflecting on his actions, who he is, why he chose his career, and who he wants to become. Great job Albert
I think this was better than any apology video he could of done.   I never understood why apology videos bothered me so much and it's for the reason Albert said at the very start - it re opens old wounds that have already started to heal.   And while he did apologize for fucking up in the video it was a very very short part of the video. And at this point I have no doubt he's remorseful - but that certainty comes from the self improvement portion. I know this impacted him because of the changes he made to his life afterward. I hope he continues to be a better version of himself.  In some ways this inspired me. Maybe I should give my room a good cleaning. (Not that it's messy, but really pull out all the stops, Vacuum, dust, polish the wood on my desk etc).
This is so encouraging to watch! It’s amazing to see the self growth and development that Albert has done and is continuing.
Yo cool trick shot what’s it called the no looker throw piece of trash trick shot
This was beautiful and inspiring💜💜
Ummmmm...i dont understand what did he do?
Thts such an entrance compared to an apology video with half of the video being heavy inhales and exhales. Could be the level of a Netflix documentary
yeast boy 1# also im still a bit mad which might make no sense cuz i personally dont know u or lily but liy is so nice and pure and so sweet but she forgave u shes happy so ya
bonk u u are forgiven by lily so u are forgiven by meeeeeeeeeeeee
The fuck this videos is on another level. U should be applying for legit movie making Albert!
Yeast part made me genuinly laugh-
God this made me cry and I don't even know why- I barely watched albert but wow this is sad.
I dunno But I though this was an ad for a car or something
Glad your back Albert, everyone makes mistakes, & I forgive you, no one deserves to feel this way nor suffer because of the mistakes you make. Glad you've be working on yourself. KEEP IT UP 😁❤👍
We have seen all the memes and know what comes up the instant you search his name but this was a truly inspirational video. Hope that you are successful on your journey and thank you for sharing your story to us. The work that you have started to do is amazing and I'm sure that lots of us want to see more from you!
Dope vid tho. Good luck to your life 🥂
oh goodness I'm crying so bad
I've fucked up too. Many times and I still haven't forgiven myself once. This video kinda helped me see and validate my own growth over the years and work towards forgiving myself.   I know I'm late and I didn't really know about this guy till now. I just googled him because of the memes but, Albert, thanks!
Yeast
Blegh
I like how Albert says “hit the gym if you’re depressed” reminds me when Michael said in a stream” I workout when Im depressed, which is all the time” to explain why he was so buff😫
Say what you will about the person, that was really well made.
i've been watching this over and over again... It doesnt look like an Apology Video... its like hes telling his feelings like a poetry. . . its so good and touched my heart...
Albert’s arc > Fed’s arc
Okay video aside , Thomas burning was the funniest shit I've seen today.
I like sykkuno much better
hey I don't know you man and neither did I watch when you got "cancelled" but anyone can see that you suffered as well. You spoke my mind and this video honestly motivated myself to be a better me. As I said, I don't know you but I'm proud of you and I hope you're proud of yourself for growing out of being a selfish fuck to a better you. best of luck buddy
Damn what keyboard did he used?
Still a better character arc than Fed's
Damn bro, you made the best trick for last, *YOU MADE A WHOLE CAREER DISAPPEAR*
Welcome Mr.Al, to champions club forsenCD
2:22 uhh i thought thats good? i mean i cant tell i sleep like 11 hours a day
It's hard to do this albert❤️! Will support you all the way.
Something this highly produced/scripted feels extremely disingenuous but I guess it’s working for these people 🙄
Hmm This somewhat a Good Plot in a Rollercoaster Anime with a Sad ending, wait me up 1 year I'll be back at this
11 min Video without ads yeah I'm sold
What you did was fucked up, just keep getting your shit together.
It’s been a while and I can tell things have changed for you :) I hope you get better.
It’s not my place to “accept” his apology considering I wasn’t someone he hurt, but coming from someone who never really watched Albert or Lily at all I do believe this is 100% genuine. Although cheating is something utterly disgusting, growing from your mistakes and learning from them is a whole lot better than a shitty 5 minute apology video with fake tears and lies.
Oh god stfu
im really happy for the guy honestly, its great that hes changed and i hope hes doing even better now  best wishes for albert from some random joe on the internet who cares
Can someone explain to me why is he apoligizing ?
I really miss them playing together with music
LilyPichu
This is..... The best apology video that could ever exist. I don't even really watch you or others that you were connected to in the content creator community, but from this I can tell that your feelings are genuine and how much this means to you. I might not know you at all, but I'm proud. I hope you can keep improving yourself, and I think most, if not all of us, can relate to everything you've said in this video to one extent or another.
The cinematography of this update video is surprisingly stunning.
Do better lol
What is the music at about 06:00?
I don't no how bad your fuck up was, but as someone who has fucked up plenty n been fucked over by ppl n life, I love this video, self growth &self love is so important, i hope u chose to keep healing and b the person u want to b. I hope all involved see the world in a happier frame of mind. N we all heal in our own sweet time, the main thing is to feel day by day that the sun will shine &u want to walk in it. I think this is the first time I've commented on here, I don't tweet &try to go on fb as little as poss, so if I offend I'm sorry, it must b hard to deal with everyone up in your lives n bashing u, coz we humans r a bunch of negative asses.
I'm not hating but I think he did this video during this time of the fed incident so he wouldn't get backlash
Good video
At first when I saw this video I still hated him, I didn’t accept him coming back and I disliked the video, but now I came back and I’m happy he saw his mistakes and change himself, I’m proud of him.
You have to admit, even though if you don't like him. The production was insane. I hate when apology videos are just people either flex how rich they are or crying in front of a camera with a hoodie.
*This is one of the most beautiful personal pieces I have ever seen in my life. This is definitely for himself.*
Good luck man.
“ you can either learn from your mistakes or you dont. “
Best part is that he regained control of his life. Some don’t realize how hard it is to pick yourself up and forgive yourself of what you did because of the hurt it caused others. Albert had the confidence to apologize on YouTube and continue with his career.
Have a good day, Albert
This is a great video.
Welcome back
I believe in change just like my own father changed for the better never held a grudge or hated him instead I forgave him and now we are closer than ever. I hope you find that happiness ❤
sourdough gang
The egg 😢
I can't believe I was going to write something potentially hurtful. Man, it's not our place to forgive him (the viewers). Everyone thinks they're an expert on someone's life behind the screen. The dude said he's changed, so all we can do is assume he has and watch what we can of him grow into a better person. Best of luck to you Albie, I know you can do it.
Making mistakes is normal and part of how we grow as people. Don't shame a man who is learning from his mistakes. He's bettering himself, and from this video it seems like the person who is having the hardest time moving on is himself. Hoping to see more content that you enjoy making in the future Albert
I watched this randomly on new years eve.
7:22 ForsenCD
What you did was wrong. But I see that you are trying to change and become a better person. Like you said, it’s what you do after your mistake that defines you. Love you albie!
This was so beautiful
This video is beautiful
I will like more of your content
All scarra wanted was friends :-(
I dislike the cancel culture.
Doesn't matter if others forgive you. Forgive yourself, and write your path.
Nah still sucks
As always be safe guyz~
5:28 unexpectedly albert has quite a fancy skincare collection
I don't care if your mistake bc one mistake won't blinded myself from all your goods
I keep watching this video, thinking I want to be like that. He’s changed and deserves credit for everything he’s done to be better.
You know what you need to do albert? Stop talking and move on
When he made yeast Boi I thought “Oh so he’s finally lost it” but it makes sense
Nice try
This is such a beautiful video. Amazingly shot and directed. Being able to show growth and sincerely committing to it is such an important thing. He’s apologized and been forgiven by the people he hurt, and strangers (the viewers) on the internet shouldn’t keep trying to get rid of him for something that (1) did not actually affect them and (2) is really none of their business.
fuck...i'm crying!  I really hope you learned from your mistakes and I wish you all the happiness and success you deserve!
Calls the video selfish, Made the most relatable movie on youtube
U know what, this dude might have cheated years ago. But he change, and that shit is hard. And thats what matter! Yes, change.  Congrats, Mr. Chang u gained a new subscriber! Im waiting for ur new video~
Holy shit i haven’t watched this channel for like forever you look different ngl and looking good
dude.. I used to be his fan, I love his violin covers. But since everything happened, I was a bit upset. AND THIS VIDEO CAME TO MY HOME PAGE, this video is just like a short film. I really love his editing and cinematography. So, I decided to be his fan again:)
I think he showed a lily when he said "it cost me many of the people closest to me"
Albert messed up, but he took his time off to truly re-evaluate his life choices and determined how he can be a better person to everyone, including himself. No one is perfect; we all make mistakes. Both Albert and the ones he hurt made amends and moved on with their lives, and now they’re all semmingly doing great. If you still think he isn’t being genuine, you need to stop and re-evaluate your own outlook on these situations. I respect Albert for making these strides, and I’m wishing the best for him and everyone else in his life.
This was an insanely beautiful video. I’m so happy for you and wish you the best Albert <3
Im glad its a self improvement video over an apology video. Wish you the best. Looking forward to seeing that new content
❤️❤️❤️
Good luck on your journey, my friend.
Wowwwwwwwww, yo glad to see you back Albie! Can’t wait to see you produce some content. Your cinematics are amazing! Honestly this suits you. Welcome to the darkside. Can’t wait to see your down to earth content.
This is a positively supporting comment.   I just don't know how to put it in words because... well, my emotions and language disconnected.   So I'll keep it simple. Go Albie!!
Great. A very sentimental comeback. Welcome back cheater
Dude, this is fantastic. I could watch a full feature about your story,
That was really cool to watch
You won.
I love the editing in this vid
A sad anime back story can make any one switch sides faster then usain bolt
It's kinda sad that ppl are still calling Albie "Two of wives great choice" "Cheaters will always be cheaters" " Cheater".I really want to scream at their faces and say " You have no right to say that you weren't the one who was involved in the cheating, plus lily already forgave Albie so you have no rights to be mad at him and also sending death threats to him, now stfu"and slap their faces
People will make fun of him for this and hate him for cheating on Lily but I feel sad for his Grandmother's loss.
I used to be fan but you messed up but Lily already forgive you so we'll try again don't worry many of us still love you so pls try to do what you want and maybe many people will love you more so do what you want
YAY YOUR BACK!!
Massive hats off. I don't know if you will read  this comment or not. I absolutely love it, the amount of work that went through is insane, what more insane is the honesty.  No one is perfect, and trust me people who scrutinized you have done way more awful shite than you could ever fathom.   You are a beyond exceptional artist. Your film making in this one truly shines.   Keep living.
Making coffee? This kinda reminds me of re:cafe. If you know what I mean. But yeah. I hope you're doing better Albert
this is such a cool video
(っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ nooo 🥺 look at you , look at how much you are repenting .....you are already forgiven , you might not get the words 'you are forgiven albert' but you yourself should know that you have repented ....so move on ! Start fresh and I swear you will be much better 🥺 all the best !!
Hoooly Mooly! This almost made me cry for some reason... First of all 10/10 for the editing, it was amazing and it goes straight to my top edited videos! I really hope you will follow your journey and become who you want to be.. I'll be here... watching with a thumbs-up! - A fan <3
Hmm so sad to bad
i was extreamly dissapointed when all the drama happened, hopefully you can change and become a better person.
That was really a vibe check for me
The amount of time and effort put into the sound design and camera work is simply astounding! I've honestly never seen anything with this much quality.
Rip Nai Nai ❤️❤️❤️
I thoroughly enjoyed this, despite my preconceived notions of you. I'm glad your working to change yourself for the better. That's what anyone with two functioning brain cells and a drop of empathy were hoping for. Good luck.
first of all, we don't need to forgive Albert because he didn't do anything to his fans but to Lily and his friends. his apologies are not for us but for Lily and his loved ones. just because he fucked up doesn't mean we have the right to forgive him because he wasn't apologizing to us but to his friends. he is trying to become a better person and his apologies were not for us. he already knows his mistakes and trying different things to make it up to his friends so please don't say you forgive him because he didn't do anything to you. instead we should congratulate him for trying to become a better person and we should also be apologizing for making it worse  by flaming him. lily already forgave albert and fans shouldn't keep looking down on him for his mistake. so Albert congrats on trying to become a better person. you just need to take it one step at a time.
It's not our place to demand an apology if we weren't directly involved. No one can deny that he fucked up horribly. No one can predict what will happen in the future. Maybe he'll change for the better, maybe he'll screw up again, who knows for sure? No one does. However, Albert is admitting to his horrible choices. It's clear from his recent streams on Twitch that he's trying to change, and I respect his effort. If you're publicly shaming him even after he's trying to change, then you're discouraging him becoming a better person. Frankly, that's just low and pathetic. Even if Lily hasn't forgiven him in public, that doesn't mean she hasn't forgiven him in private. She even said that they are on good terms now(go search it up, there are clips). Albert has already apologized, so why should he have to again for the sake of the internet? And honestly, telling someone to end their life for cheating isn't funny, nor is it okay. We've already seen from the Reckful situation how our words affect others on social media, even if those words are meant as a joke. The least we can do, in my opinion, is judge what he does after his horrible choices, not before. It hasn't been too long and people are already saying "oh, you cheated on lily, don't come back." People change, and Albert is trying to prove that. Anyway, good luck, and looking forward to your music.
Is this the guy that cheated on Lily? New to the drama here
This is showing how he tried to change himself without an apology but he manage to give us the word"I'm sorry"
Keep talkin shit everyone.  He’ll end up like reckful.
I am not defending anyone but everyone knows you deserve a second chance
The cinematography is beautiful in this video.
Aint gonna lie this video is really REALLY good
Honestly a really good video. You can tell this was months of writing and shooting. Seems extremely sincere. Well done.
this video made me a fan....
unrelated to the video i realised he used his new album music as bg music in this video and im loving it
Your filmmaking is incredible the detail in this video, the style. Fuck your past your videos are amazing
Also, sorry for your grandma , may she rests in peace, brother.
Nvm the dislikes. There's dislikes in every videos in youtube channel it doesnt matter in some points. There's people supporting your change : m happy you learned from your past, dont get discouraged, stay strong. I hope you'll be able to forgive yourself.  And to become the person you are hoping for. I cried watching this video. Because for sure anyone can recognize himself. Human is not perfect, we are made of mistakes.  But some just thinks they re bigger than their size and they judge u
No pain no gain.
Stand up albert
I'm crying :(
U basically emotionless and I was mad and feel bad for u :-(
Albert, this is honestly one of the greatest films I've seen. The amount of time and consideration you put into every shot, the sound design, lighting, editing, and storytelling - it really shines through this work of art. But more importantly, the amount of time you've put into reflecting, seeking help, and improving yourself impresses me even more. I can't wait to see what the future holds for you as you shape it into what & who you desire to become - one your 奶奶 would be proud of.
I don’t rlly care but Lilly was such a nice girl u rlly fucked up dude
It's not my apology to except but thank you for trying to better yourself. I takes a man to own up to his mistakes and realize the stuff that you've done wasn't right
Hes gonna grow as a person again ya got this fam ❤
You know, people who made mistakes and changed for the better are better than a person who never did a single mistake. Because the former already learned his lesson while the latter are still there to commit mistakes. Really glad to see you learn your lesson :> I hope I can do self-love for myself just like you. Best of Luck, Albert Chang!
Well it's not like he killed someone.. Things happen
Atleast he's not like other people who cheats and not change at all. I hope he sees this but its okay if not lmao.  Some other content creators would sit in the center with a white backround and tears apologizing after few weeks prior to their issue, but through albert's creative side he showed us how aware he is and how he regret those mistakes. Its good that he took 1 year break after the issue, he had more time to reflect on things without the distraction of soc med. We can also see how he wants to change and show us that he has learned something from that experience. When u did something wrong in the past, you gotta live through it. You did the mistakes and now u gotta face the consequences whether u like it or not. I am not in albert's situation rn but imagine how much courage he gathered up to make this video, instead of just permanently quitting everything. Albert, i know you f'ed up in the past. A lot of people got mad (including me) but you still have a lot of time to change the wrongs, and you should do the things you want to do. Take your time, i know you are old enough to know that change doesnt happen overnight. Thank you for doing this video and i hope people will still forgive you, and i also hope that you wont do this ever again.
Everybody makes mistakes because we are all humans
This made me cry. Mostly because it really kicked into me how much I haven't been true to myself. I loved it. All the best to you Albie!
Ayo, cancel cultrue is dumb. Cancel someone over one thing is stupid.
Welp human I don't really know all the drama in details and i don't really want to know more because it drama from a year ago but I'm glad your getting yourself together and for your human grandma i wish they could see you off on your Journey
I know what he did is, somehow, unforgettable because that was selfish, I know. But everybody changes. I'm not telling you guys to forget the things Albert had done, but since, like the other comment said, "Lily forgave Albert" and that is why we, also, must stop hating or bashing him... Albert had to take a break in the online world for so long to really show that he regretted doing bad stuff, because not being active for a streamer or content creator is a hard thing to do... Don't just look at the point of view of most viewers, look at the point of view of those who are involved...
Damn this is one of the best redemption arcs I've ever seen
You might have cheated man but everyone deserves forgiveness and you have a talent I hope you can bounce back on your feet :)
Much love Albert
This video is a whole masterpiece, it feels like a pat in the back for people that think they don't deserve a second chance.
"When you do what your love your life becomes your work"
The way I cried with this, I just know him because I watched him in other youtube channels but I was so immersed in this whole story. His talent is undeniable.
It's my first time visiting his channel and I'm in such an awe, his talent just blew my mind. I'm a new fan now.
I'm rooting for you, Albert. You are so TALENTED and a good person. Wishing you the best.
That was a whole movie and I loved every second of it. I'm in tears.
You burn enough bridges, the only direction to move is forward
anyone knows the keyboard Albert's using in this vid?
aight, i'm new i don't have any say in this, and i'm most definitely not the person he hurt most so i can't accept his apology or some shit but even if he made a mistake you CAN'T send death threats.
honestly THIS is how you come back from being canceled. aint gonna lie, i cracked jokes at the time. but im glad to see potential growth hope he makes it.
Also, Albert, I have made many mistakes in my lifetime but, they did not change me that much, and if they did they made me a better person. The only reason you felt that once you did what you love was turning into your work is that you stopped loving it or you are now doing it for love anymore but the appeal for other people like viewers. It changes once you are not doing it for your elf anymore and if you want people to see your talent you will have to make sure that it makes you happy too since it won't feel like work anymore.
you are a good person Albert, I know I don't really know me but,  the saying you broke in your video meant that if you do what you love, it would not means that you are doing it for work but for the pleasure of feeling happy which then means that you are not doing it for money, fame, or your ego. But once you change the thing that you love for money fame or other things the saying is changed it means that you are now doing it for other things besides love.
I bet 1/4 people don’t know what happened, but that’s besides the point :) I kinda thought you died...
This is probably the best produced/thought out thing I've ever seen! You're amazing man.
Nice editing yo
I can't help, but saying this was really well thought out and said. I really like the path you are going on and I hope you can find the light at the end of you tunnel. It sounds like a lot of work and I can see myself in some aspects. I totally respect you are working on yourself. Hope to see you in the future despite all the faults. It'll be a long journey really.
This hits me hard. For me i got myself into depression for over 3 years but the effect shows up in the fourth year. It causes me to prolong my 4 years undergrad study into 7 years. I distance myself from my family and friends. Everytime i got contacted, i always says i am fine. I got angry when people actually try to help me. It was such a mess. But i'm glad i went through with it and graduated last month lol. Never give up to find healthy happiness and never stop to improve yourself ;)
Aight imma slap myself everytime i think about dying. ow.
the quality and messages in this are so good
I Will be honest i meet by your beatiful covers And violín songs actualy i listening ,i don't know what's happenend and i don't care really i love your músic and i Will continúe listening no matter what's happenend , You Start the self improvent Journey an thats si increidible and very Nice maybe the Best choiche of your life i like the self improvent i Start My Journey some time ago , an i can recommend You read books , meditating , trust me help You a lot
I am sorry for your Nana. Take care Albert. I wonder why you change your channel name now I know.,. I was actually missing your medley and decided to come back to check your channel. Some of the medley you created I love them a lot they stick in my mind. Your parents trained your learning ability, they pushed you, did not spoil you when you wanted to give up learning violin so that you can go far and enjoy violin. I love this video a lot and watched from the beginning to the end. I always don't mind your quantity of videos, coz I know your video have high quality.
welcome back albert!
Everybody deserves a second chance
This is kinda inspiring
Damn this gave me goosebumps. Honestly couldnt give to sh*ts what you did but its what you did after which is something you should be proud of. Becoming someone you want to be not what your told to be. Awesome Editing. Loved it. Keep up the awesome work
This is better than an apology..I’m glad your back and actually changed yourself.
look man hears what you do you accept what you did and go pray and ask god if he can forgive you.
He just cheated people do it everyday
Ah yes, the only drama I love on YouTube.
man i love this video so much
i still cried even tho im mad at him...
You know even though you did something bad, that never changed what I thought of you, I liked your music, and your magic, every month I keep checking “when will Albert come back” and Lo and behold he’s back. It’s good to see you back, and good luck out their it’s kinda been a shit show lately
ya’ll this video looks so good it looks like an actual movie but a short one 🥴
be well soon, albert. i am counting on you. see you again soon
i cried......this was truly motivational even if it wasnt the notion of the video.....glad youre doing better albie and hope to see you again soon as a content creator
HES BACK YES THE MAN IS BACK WOOOOOOHHH
The flower one and the piano one reminds me of lily
Me with head phones: *THIS IS A MOVIE THE SOUND QUALITY IS JUST MWAH*
<3
I've never seen a more sincere remorse than this. I was really inspired by the part where you rekindled a flame inside yourself by remembering what you wanted as a child. I strive to get back to that spark too. I wish you all the best Albert.
This made me genuinely happy
We get you, this video was enough for me! But this apology I can't forgive because it isn't mine to forgive about. I do hope once I search up your name in the future that you will reach your goals and become the man you hope you are. Everyone makes mistakes, maybe the person reading this did and doesn't know they did, just because you made a mistake and your famous doesn't mean the people who make mistakes and aren't famous worst. Lily is a kind person, she will forgive you to what you did, since you haven't said why you done it, we can't blame you. I hope too see more of your videos in the future!
People are willing to give him another chance. I wonder if that is the same case for that girl avocadosomething.
Good vid
I’ve been cheated on and it sucks. I was bitter and insecure for awhile but eventually, to move on, you have to let go. You have to just forgive eventually to get that weight off your chest. I hated what Albie did to Lily but WE ARE ALL HUMANS! I’m not saying what he did was okay but look, I’m very happy that he’s come such a long way. I don’t hold his mistakes onto him. Every day is a new day to change yourself to become a better version of yourself. You can be a new and better person mentally if you are always wanting to better and strengthen your mind. I don’t like what he did but I respect him for what he’s been through and who he has become and is becoming. Welcome back Albie! Humanity hasn’t changed much but you’re not missing out on much hahah your video was beyond amazing. You owned up to your mistakes and you bettered yourself. I’m very happy for you that you’ve found happiness from within yourself and enjoying you time. Be so happy with yourself that one day when you are ready for a relationship, it’s to share who you are with them. Love and respect the you today.
But damn the effort on the vid looks like a movie trailer   But i missed you bro
can he just tell why a got fucking canclled nobody cares about ur story we just wanna know what happend stop be so "quirky"
So dramatic ..
We love you Albert ! we're glad you're back ! thank you for the motivations
This is so relatable
As a former photographer, I can definitely validate that doing what you love for work does not always make you happy. I can relate in that I ended up being at my unhappiest during that time. This video was honest, raw and creative and drove me to hit subscribe. I hope your journey takes you to where you need to be.
Sooo if we can take something from this its when you hit rock bottom you can always start from zero and the only thing you can do its get back on your feet go on and be better and im glad Albert its doing that.
btw liking people and wanting to spend time with your friends isn't being extrovert.. you can still be an introvert and enjoy spending time with your friends and family and gain energy from that
Hey dont lie, you cried.
U know he was trynna not to smile when he finnaly got that papper in the trash
I just wanna say,Almost all the time I've been on the internet, comments wouldn't be very nice or very smart but in comments of streamers and stuff, there are so many people who help the rest rather dumb people see the reality in quite a nice way. I thank all the people who actually helped hold down the fort in this comment section. You guys are smart
"started sleeping 8 hours a day"  umm isn't that what you're supposed to do?
Deeeeep
Am glad u took some time away and realized all the things important to u...it just proved that u actually deeply care about people and dont just use them... thank u for this...thank u for improving...all humans fuck up but not all humans are this courageous to own up their mistake and improve themselves.. Welcome back Albert..
Wow I'm moved This isn't a apology video but a life lesson for all of us
Better than pokimane’s apology
All I can say is wow, just wow.  Welcome back, Albie.
The message aside, I just wanna appreciate the cinematography and clever timings and details albert has put into this video. Not only this video is motivational, but its also pleasing to watch, I can see myself watching this over and over again if I'm ever in dark times and in need of inspiration again in the future.  Anyways, you called it a selfish video but I think this video has resonated a lot to a lot of us, so thank you, Albert. As you said, it's very rare to see cancelled people coming back in better shape, so seeing you again in good shape is very refreshing and relieving, and honestly a perfect reminder that anyone can come back, even at the deepest depths of rock bottom, meaning that we should never give up too no matter how bleak things may seem.
i don't know why my eyes is crying
The editing is actually really fuckin pog
brro i literally dont care man, all i want to say is how good his film making is like damm jesus christ. this video is so creative and so good, kudos to you man. i love your vidoes like this really
Yis hes baccc
Dude this made me sad and happy at the same time. It's sad seeing someone slowly become not as happy as they were before, the bright smile is not there anymore, his words, at some point, felt so painful. However, I'm kinda happy that he decide to make himself better, that takes a lot of courage and effort because most people would say sorry but still do the same thing over and over. Saying sorry is easy, but changing yourself to not make the same mistake is far more difficult. So Albert, I just want to say that you're not perfect but it's okay, everybody makes mistakes but I applaud you for being strong and being brave. Hold on to hope and your passion and I hope someday you'll be able to forgive yourself.
HE WAS RUNNING ON LIBERTY cAcKlEIng
Though I didn't like him at first re-watching lily's old videos made me realize he's such a good man, and I know it's just a mistake he's done, I look forward to the new you, and yes I will support you.
i really liked the video, we all make mistakes. we are human. Working on it will probably be hard for you. but working on it  today means your one step closer then yesterday. :) keep it up! @albie #albie
this is exactly what i needed to run into today. i’ve been going through such a hard identity crisis. my passions have turned into a routine online for an audience to see. when hardly anyone pays attention, i try to work more harder to the point that i pricked sewing needles into my fingers and sang with a hoarse voice over a stage. i just feel captivated by this whole message. i too was cancelled by a fandom. and i’m only now realizing i never did anything for me. with what was your phone calls of requests was what i think of as opportunities in my eyes; things that i cannot pass up or else i could lose the fortune. i’m still in the process. but i’m getting there  and this is exactly what i needed to see
i know u  . u are better then this before that .i dont know what make u do what u did i think someone planned it idk somethings still hidden, and you know that u just dont want to reveal them and hide it in fact you were the one who damaged more and they did not see them a day crying or something because you are serious with them anyway i will support you when ever where ever how ever and fk ppl who hate u if  everyone look at his mistake they will show demons in front of you ..................
i wish you the best albert
the cinematography of this video, seems ingenuine, and just weird... but that's just my opinion. i dont know albie, but i wish you the best, as well as everyone else involved. mistakes create the better people we become.
I'm glad to hear this and hear things are getting better in your mind. Support you all the way man.  <3
im happy that he is trying to better himself and that is all that matters.
Don't get me wrong, what he did was fkcing terrible but cancel culture is so toxic and he did not deserve those death threats.
“Fans” can be disgustingly toxic and would give ANYTHING for some drama that doesn’t involve them. I’m not put on this Earth to tell people what they should or should not do with their life, but cancelling Albert for one mistake (which was forgiven by Lily) is basically what people on Twitter do all the time. Before replying, think to yourself: Did this situation involve me and why should I be obsessed about other people’s problems when I can’t solve my own?  Now, we know who the fake fans were, and could move forward. Let’s appreciate Albert’s new music
8h of sleep is considered healthy, but i consider it depends on how much you actually need.
This was really well made
i liked ur video :)
YEEEEEast
Great video, welcome back
Wait so wht happened
Why does this sound like a shitty Netflix angsty teen movie?
Wow, that is realy nicely done video. The best thing to know is that Albie learned something and he will be much more smarter for the future. I hope that Fedmyster will do the same.
you cannot stop making large mistakes in your life, we are here albert still supporting you,  can't wait to see more astonishing videos
Wait people hate this guy because he cheated,  on a multi colored hair, immature twitch streamer that can barely process and direct a full articulate sentence? yikes.
I honestly don’t believe that a mistake someone made a year ago should haunt him for the rest of his life. He fucked up, that’s true, but yet again everyone makes mistakes and it’s good to see that he is changing into a better person. You have to move on, if you get stuck in your past, you won’t achieve anything.
Good on him to admit he fucked up, doesn't change how wrong he was.
The cards scene had a missed opportunity to show a 2 of wives card to subtly hint on what happened and own up to it in a more somewhat joking way
The Gryffindor lego girl when he say "hurt people" damn that easter egg...
Atleast your able and have means to take a year off be able to watch TV plays games all day etc damn I need to start a youtube
I’m glad you are trying to make up for your sins Albert and also glad to hear that you’re doing ok I really look forward to seeing a bit of content ☺️👍
Dude cheater or not albert is a fcking talented. Great production btw.
nice filmmaking dude
This is actually beautiful to watch and know. Hope ur doing well Albert, people fuck things up in their life no matter what, the best you can do is get better and move on. We're here rooting for you.
You fucked up. Made a mess... But... But at least... You've regretted it. Ans changing for the better. Hats to you pal!
Honestly, damn ok.
Not gonna lie, I know this is supposed to be a serious video, but That coffee and bread scene was amazing
All the drama bullshit that is irrelevant to this video and I'm just here amazed by the damn cinematography. gg.
Coffee hmm
You did a really shit thing, and though I know Lily has already forgaven you like the blessed soul she has. But you better change and I really hope you can, good luck.
This was made extremely well.
Ah...yess, a man and his yeast. Name a more iconic duo. I'll wait...
This video was so cute and yet so well made. Loved it for a first time viewer
I wish you luck buddy
Not really related to the actual vid but those cinematic are fire lol
POKIMANE TAKE NOTES
I didn’t even know he was gone lol 🤷🏼‍♂️!!!
PLOT TWIST: months after the incident, Albert missed his day with Lily. He just realized that it feels empty without Lily around.    Sometimes things like this happen to some people, just admit it.  Nevermind. Ignore this.
Stupid landlord, he's trying to change and adopting an animal is one of the most emotionally enriching thing ever and you are also saving an animal's life
I'm not taking sides but I genuinely think  that frogs are cute, like what the heck they be like "wibbit UwU"
Just because he committed a mistake, that doesn't mean that there's no good left in him.  Him and Lily gave us good memories, actually fun contents that we've seen them doing together. He made a mistake, he chose to cheat, made the dumbest decision that he knows could potentially destroy him and his career. But I think this man is willing to change for the better. Lily has accepted him and forgave him, so let's forgive him as Lily knows him better than we do. Lily and the entire OTV members knows Albert is a good and kind-hearted guy,  but that one mistake dominated all the good that he did and people instantly thinks that he's ruthless.  If the world is like this where people just ignore all the good things we've done and instead look us by our mistake then this world would be a terrible place to live.
I will support you Albert even after the break up. People has the right to change. Please live a happy life
The fact his dedication goes so far as to lay in a trash bin full of garbage to make a video about him trying to be a better person and learn from whatever things he fucked up on is incredibly impressive.  people who are still trying to degrade him for cheating or whatever honestly need to imrpove their own lives
With the drama aside can we just take a moment to appreciate how good of an edit this was?
subscribed
Man, I feel so bad rn
i cried watching this
i missed your content
I wish the best for u man
This video is so well made holy shit
As a man who've also fucked up really hard I support every word you say and wish you luck in your way to becoming a better version of yourself!
Fedmyster taking notes
Although hurting people around you and who are closest to you may be one of the worst things you can do, it doesn’t mean you’ll stay that way. People on the internet don’t personally know these people, they hold grudges and deny change. But no matter what someone has done, they can always try to change and others must accept and help them to do so. Albert May have fucked up pretty badly and I was hurt for Lily and their friends, I’m happy to see him changing for the better and I wish him nothing but the best in future.
Take care <3
The effort put into this is insane. Every shot is tied to the story Albert's  telling, there is no excess talk about what already happened. He can't do anything more than admiting his mistakes and saying sorry, and he's aware of that, allowing him to try and better himself and not dwell on the past. The internet isn't forgiving, so it won't be easy, but I really wanna see how this story unfolds.
Hey =) we spoke on discord way back, barely :) what i wrote then still stands, come back strong homie :)
8:41 is that your "ex-girlfriend"
ForsenCD
good job.  i’m crying.  gg
This video hit different and I give props to Albert keep it up u can do this
1:58 elon musk said that? How dare he
Bruh. This whole video is relatable as fuck. You’re on the right path my man, much love ❤️
This is a masterpiece!
You know, I’ve never really subscribed to the kind of content you made when you with OTV. But this video is so well done, and can be applied to any one of our lives. People should really watch this empathically, and truly see that mistakes are made. But steps to move in the right direction is makes us ultimately grow. This was supposed to happen to you. And I’m glad to see you growing into a more happy, and more complete person now.
we were all dissapointed at him(albert), but a person reflecting on all his past actions is a life changer. you're doing well albert. Its nice to see you being healthy the moment you publicized this video. You really fucked up big time. But I'm still proud that you're managing your life the right way. Just remember you don't have to prove yourself to the public all the time just because you're a content creator. Its more important to be human.    You're doing great man, walk forward, from now on.
Good video
you are great at directing, wow. Honestly a really well shot video
LEGENDS NEVER DIE!
He changed and Lily's fine now with mykull. He learned a lesson from it, Let's accept the reality and it's normal to be fucked up because nobody is perfect and in the end, no one will win because both have different POV and OPINIONS, if I'm wrong I'm wrong its just my opinion. I'm happy that Albert is staying strong and accepting that he messed up, he did change and deserve a new page for it.
Damn this video is so cooooollll
People don't understand that he has pain a lot of pain in his heart and u can rlly fucking see that people change under pain. He felt no happiness. For a fucking year he felt that and people don't even care
I support you, I hope things get better <3
Yo this was actually amazing it was very Buetiful and I really liked the symbolism you added throughout the video.  10/10 very good :D
I feel so bad to say this but I was so mad at albert after what happened but this video melted my heart and I am not that mad but still very little although I wish you all the best and hope you do well 😃
wow .
I'm a bit late to everything. But you know, I've been in his shoes and I've seen plenty of people in his shoes. Albert is the first person I've seen actually change from mistakes he's made. It makes me hopeful for changing myself from my past mistakes.
Hi, Albert. I think it's time we met the new you. :) <3
this is what people need to do after they mess up. hats off to you albert and the amazing production quality!
I must say, I'm genuinely impressed to see someone respond to being canceled with acceptance of fault. You moved forward and actually reflected on yourself without trying to pretend you were the victim. Since the whole practice started, I've waited for the day someone would actually take it, own up, and roll with the punches rather than going down in a fiery wreck of denial and finger pointing. You did that. You weren't exonerated like a Projared or James Charles, you took your lumps and moved forward. Finding this video after Fed revived his own terrible bullshit to effectively do nothing but drag down the people who used to be his friends, I gotta give it up. You've shown there's a way forward and demonstrated why it's worth having you back in the public sphere. Good fuckin' job.
Lily forgave Albert  Why haven’t you?
You know i wont lie I didnt like you after whole drama but your indeed right sir everyone can change. I hope you find your passions mate 😊 not bad my friend not bad at all.
whats with all the profanity tho... lol
Im not
I love how everything you do is so high Quality. I hope i can see more from you.
Albert, I may not know you but I do know that you are a great person. Humans are bound to make mistakes and no one is perfect. Mistakes bring individuality. Unfortunately, you are cursed with fame but please do not let these people belittle you, you are everything you are because you are great. The only way to progress is to move forward and to attempt to better yourself every day, as we all should. I know what you're feeling and will feel maybe for the rest of your time being as it never fades away. It will always be a reminder and it will help make the change permanent, some days it will haunt, other days it will humble. Continue to do the things you have always been passionate about and enjoy living! the future awaits you! Lastly, stop putting yourself down, the road of self-deprecation is not the way to go about things. Love yourself and learn to love as much as you can to everyone around you!
it was very good video... it's like watching a moral movie. and best wishes!
This is seriously motivating
As a film maker, DAMN these shots are fire. The storytelling is 10/10. (this comment is opposite of the point of the video lmao)
masterpiece
Growth. Great video.
hey buddie i believe in you okay
This is so beautiful and inspiring thank you, Albert!!
Awesome video man. It's not in my place to make a comment on your situation, I'm just a dude who still liked you since the beginning, but I still don't know you.
The fact that i can imagine how many "kill yourself" to albert was on twitter. Social media gets way too much on things with personal matters. Ok maybe cancel him. Sending death threats to someone who cheated is not good. You would pretty much be worse than them, hoping someone would die. Theyve moved on and so why can't we, internet?  People cheat all the time and dont get better like Albert is attempting. People abuse their special other. Pay more attention to the online ppl who do that instead of him. And my last message to whoever is still triggered at Albert: You dont know them personally. You are not the person he hurt irl and the most. Dont accept an apology that isnt yours.
wow the quality of this video is amazing
Thisbis the best apology video I've ever watched
Why are the females from OTV so manipulative causing the men from their group always commit "errors"? Anyways, I'm glad you're back do your own thing.
Keep doing you Albert! You have my view and support!
@4:42 those fingers represent, Lily, Albert, and Michael I think
its about him and her, doesn't have anything to do with us. welcome back albert
I wish there were more people like you who are willing to change.
I personally haven't kept up with your channel and only got to know you through your appearances in OTV a few years back. I didn't really have an interest in getting to know you through your channel / live streams at the time, and I guess it was from a weird hunch that kept me away. I felt something was wrong, and, I guess, last year proved me right. Anyway, not the point. I'm glad to hear that you're not only feeling better but doing better. Despite all the shit you still might be getting, you're still deciding to make a change- A difference to make it right. I'm happy for you because of that. You're owning up to your problems and doing something about it. That's all that matters to me. Being vulnerable, opening up, and talking about personal growth, I got to know you better as a person, and I'm glad I did. Your talk about doing what you love as a job and how it takes away from personal happiness spoke similarly to how I felt when thinking about pursuing my artistic hobbies as a career. I never knew someone would understand how I felt. That connection alone changed my perspective of you. If I had never given this video a chance, I probably would've lost the great opportunity of getting to know someone. A human, like me. I can already feel you've changed from watching this video, and despite not knowing you personally, I trust you're already on the right path for self-improvement. I'm happy for you to bounce back and will be rooting for your progress, either it is by watching your videos or live streams or just silently supporting you as a new viewer. Keep doing what makes you happy, Albert!
Liked the video.
I... i felt hate for what he did, but i was just curious to see what he had been up to and i just made me think about my own things and Man! i kinda needed to see this. So i hope he overcomes this and im glad to be able to it for myself.
This video prove to me this person is being better person and I respect him Tbh the feeling is delivered very well ✨ Hope everything going well for you
I was upset at first that as soon as the incident happened that Albert disappeared it felt like he kinda just left us after the scandal and abandoned the internet to escape hate? Its nice to know he was taking time for himself and improve upon himself instead of just disappearing off the internet, we appreciate you Albert and your efforts, ignore the hateful comments ^^
Hope that we can see more of you in te future Godspeed to you man
Welcome back Albert, it's good to hear from you again.
Message aside, this video is so good from an artistic standpoint. There is so much care put into every shot, and each shot resounds with what's he's saying. Definitely top tier editing and production by far.
just looked up what was the story was abt, i have concluded that sarah lee is prettier
as a person who didn't unsubscribe to your channel due to what happened in the past hoping that you might change if you still have had one person who still didn't lose hope that you can change "for the better" I hope this change is for the better and for the good of you and people around you, mr chang.
I am one of many judged you for what you've done last year. A terrible doings yet a great decision(for taking a break).  You're helping yourself for the past year, i know ur not there yet when it comes to "self healing", but doing a good job. And by that.  I WELCOME BACK :)
where is this? 10:54
we are all human, we can all make mistakes.  and since life is always lived for the first time, these mistakes help us to be better.  and if Albert did what he did, there was certainly a motivation
What cheat u using?
Gotta admit, this is better than MiniLad's sorry vid
0:54 😢 lily flowers
I love this video, outstanding flim quality. It's same good as a movie. I bet you've motivated a lot of other people who are in similar situations. Looking forward to your future video!
But how did man's pay rent
this was a better apology video than literally any other one omg       and it literally wasn’t even an apology 👁👄👁
What's your skincare routine man? Plz i need help
People make mistakes, but to know how a person truly is you have to give them a second chance to prove themselves. Sometimes, they can suprise you. Goodluck to you, Albert.
I'm glad more people choosed to forgive him for this
7:40 He's jogging on Liberty Avenue
There have been thousands of people who have done the same fucked up thing he has, but the difference is that those people act like it was nothing and he used it to learn and become a better person. Still upset he did that shit but he’s trying to be better and I respect that.
the yeast part got me, im so sorry-
hi :D
This made me cry, and gave me inspiration at the same time
We shouldn't still leave hate to him for a mistake. People make mistakes, and they deserve a second chance.    You guys shouldn't leave comments such as 'I forgive you since this wasn't an apology and also it's up to Lily'   Overall, Albert deserves a chance and we should support him
Wow.....great vid. You gained a sub
ngl, this is gonna be one of my favorite yt video of all time. At some point, albert was lowkey motivate me to become a better me
Welcome back
You know you messed up and thats not for us to tell you but I'm proud that your working on yourself.
nicely done I guess
Talented, still has bright future. Learn from mistake, good luck!
albert is a cool guy!
I love your storytelling and the way you handled the camera.. Please make a movie.
Good luck man
Honestly beautifully put Albert, like many others i joined the Albert hate band wagon when it started. Without really seeing what’s wrong with myself, watching this has really made me think about what I really want in life and how much of my life relates to yours. My biggest goal is to make sure that I myself can find the problems before they start. Now I know that sounds stupid but if you really take a look at yourself and I’m talking to anyone who stops and takes their time to read my shitty YouTube comment. If you really look at yourself you can find little strands if not huge similarities from you to who your canceling, now I don’t want to track this back to “our society” but it’s kinda true, today it’s all about if your right in the public’s eyes and not about looking deep and seeing everyone’s opinions and information who is actually related to the problem and everything becomes a game of telephone. I don’t wanna be playing telephone for the rest of my life, and this last year has helped me question that myself, and this video was my answer. So from today on even if I fail to follow up with my own ambitions or to fail to stop something to happen because of my own self pity I won’t beat myself up about it, I’ll find a way to come back better and stronger than before.
Honestly put I think that if lily has moved on and forgave Albert why can’t y’all? If your still trying to cancel him a year later your just sad...
This is amazing video, I am so happy to see again
ah i had an ultrawide monitor watching this, very pleasant
Yeast Boy 😂 I never knew about offline tv and stuff at the time period when Albert and Lily were dating, but after watching this video I have respect for him.
I have the same issues but I didn’t come to a clear conclusion.. it’s boring when it’s easy and depressing when it’s hard.. god bless us with his mercy🤲🏻
This feels like a movie.❤️
Omg u made me cry🥺😭
I very much disliked Albert but I’m proud he came back in this respectful way, unlike Fedmyster just did. Good job Albert I hope you really did feel bad, but you still deserve happiness.
Wish good things for you Albert. Is hard to shake off the dust and come around. And you doing great so far.
When the grandma part got in the video. That really hit me. My grandma and my grandpa too died and I know what you feel.
Welcome back Albert, I love you. :)
Glad go see your back and doing better
For better or worse if he wants forgiveness do it through action not words prove to us that you changed and you become a better person for me I forgive him because I believe everyone deserve a second chance. A chance of redemption. Now it’s your turn to prove me and everyone that you are better now.
Yooo I just found this out from a youtube recommendation. I'm so glad this guy is back. Redemption Arc boiss.
Your mistakes does not define the rest of your life. I mean every one deserves a second chance. We all have done a mistake at some point. No one is perfect and if you think you are, take a moment to look at yourself. Actually our mistakes are the one who lets us grow, we are all meant to make a mistake and it’s fine as long as you learn from it.
Jesus Christ the cinematics
just be glad lily is in filipino crackhead's caring
It’s all coming together
everybody makes mistakes dude. Hope you can forgive yourself and move on loved your content before. Honestly all the shit you have got is kinda fucked up dude don't let the haters let you down there are people out here who don't care about what you did but love you for who you are. 🐢
Love you bro
that mechanical keyboard though...
Beatiful film man
what you did was not the end of the world and I’m glad you’re moving forward
lol that... was awesome
Pog
you made your sorry man! cheer up mistakes are in the past now... you can move on forward <3
I needed this. Thank you Albert.
why does this look  like a prelude to a school shooter/joker moment
damn you are soooooooo good at what you do
Wow
Hey man this is just one voice of many... but don't be so hard on yourself.  You cheated, yeah it was a fuck up, but everything is working out.  You guys weren't meant to be and thats how it goes sometimes... its sucks but its a story as old as the first love story ever.  Anyway wish you the best & good luck.
my take on this is that those who are still hating on him a year later are pathetic. this wasn’t an apology video, and he said it himself. he is just trying to show the steps he has taken and is taking to better himself and make a good comeback. lily and co have already forgiven him so what gives the haters the right to still be mad at him, attempt to cancel him, and condemn him? he hasn’t done anything to you guys and he has already asked for forgiveness for those he has really wronged, not you guys, there isn’t a need to apologize to you. lily herself has also come out and say that she condemns those who are still hating on albert and attempting to continue to cancel him. support him if u want. don’t support him if u don’t want but don’t try to still hate on him a year later for something so trivial at this point.
Ngl he looks like Vina sky
What is this a movie? lol glad ur back man
Goddamn this is beautiful
Can I just say this is the first video I've watched of this guy and he's giving off the OG albert vibes.
WHY DID NO ONE FKN TELL ME YOU'RE BACK!!!!! YAAAAAASSSSSSS
When he said he had a passion for film making, damn right he wasn't lying.
Since some of y’all can’t understand, these “I forgive him” comments are HILARIOUS, you don’t accept an apology that isn’t meant for you. You shouldn’t accept his apology, you should support and agree with Lily, not just a simple “I forgive him”.
This is saddly beautiful.  I think that you're evolution and growth is really admirable. The truth is we are human beings at the end of the day, we fuck up, we hurt people, we get hurt, we learn, we grow, we disappoint. The must hard thing to do is realise it and have the courage to change and do what it takes to be a better person. You had that courage and took the time to learn about yourself and who you are. To me it's  inspiring. This was a beautiful video, I really enjoied it and I'm very excited to see what you will do next.  PS : Sorry if my english is not very good, I'm french :)
Nah fam, go back into hiding pls
i am alone in my bed with all these thoughts in my head and living silently inside
i never had a grudge on him if anything i felt bad when soooooo many people said it was his fault i know some of it is but com on man he didnt deserve that i look up to albert the first time i saw him and still am i will never change my mind about him especially now that he is trying for a better life
I hate that people have to go out of their way to hate on people. Like. It’s not our problem. He cheated? He cheated. It’s not our problem.  We’re hurting lily too because she doesn’t want anything to be public yet we still hate on people and “cancel” them.
People are saying that this isn't an apology but it's not us who needs an apology   A & L I think have gone through a lot and enough is enough   I think even somebody like Albert has learned from the past and has grown from this  Albert, it's been a hard year on you but I wish you the best of luck
I personally don't know him nor Lily but what you did was still horrible and I hope that you wouldn't do that again to Sarah. Lily forgave you and so do I but to be honest even if both of you are friends, I don't want to see you alongside with Lily for some reason. It's like a feeling that maybe something might happen again.   Even so, Lily is happy with Micheal now. I hope you and Sarah are happy too. :)  Amazing video by the way!
Welcome back Albert Many people are glad ur back
Bro i don't know shit about him, but this man's talented af.. this video is soo freaking good
I genuinely cried 😭 it’s amazing to see you become a better person. I hope you are doing well.
The fact that he made a clarification video like it's a movie
GODDAMN! I’m crying sooo much!😭 There are some people who mess up and say “they’re gonna change”, and they never will... but I believe that Albert IS changing for the better! You have my full support Albert!
Just saying YEAST BOI POG!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats to you what you’ve achieved so far, seriously. You inspire me so much thank you.😭💖
The time and effort put into this message was like none that I have ever seen before. The dedication is real. Thank you for sending us this message Albert. I wish the best for your future endeavors.
THOSE CAMERA WORK THOUGH!
Yo I saw you using Omnisphere my guy.
Mad respect for Albert, it takes a lot to go back after being cancelled. Stay safe and keep playing.
if that was his commonapp essay he woulda got into harvard
8K people still doesn’t understand but 10x that supports and forgave you
Im new to OTV gang.  And found out about albert and the issue. Felt bad about lily. Then on utube recommendation i have watched this sleightly musical dude and loved the medley of beauty and the beast,searched for more of the covers. Loved them all. and found out it was albert = sleightly musical right? Then i was like woah. He's talented regardless of the issue. I walked to work listening to the covers. And now i have watched this. And i find you amazing. I felt everyword. May not have been in the exact position as u are right now. But i understand. And support this. Please do what u love. Hoping that involves playing violin. Cause im a new fan!!!!
wish you all the best, Albert
If lily is willing to forgive him then no one has the right to hate him, but this was inspiring, how he came back from being called the worst and made it out of the box he shut himself in, I'm just waiting to see him and his friends together again someday
music bangs
i really, really, really loved this. it's so hard to own up to everything you've done. the bad, the good, the ugly. accepting it all. recognizing how great you can be while not getting a fat head so acknowledging all the times you fell short or really fucked up is possible. It's a journey. a lifelong one. im sobbing LOL life is easy to get swallowed up and spit out as something we aren't. im happy you remembered who u r. never forget.
You know he fucked up yeah but the parts involved are willing to move on and become better so yeah good luck on everything man, hope you reach that level and achieve your ultimate form.
Albert it's ok..... The past was the past, I think Lily had also forgave you so that means so will I, I might not really watch your videos, but I will support you by not hating you.... Thank you for changing, and thank you for coming back.
Holy shit is all ur vids like this?? Ur edits op :D
Beautifully created and wishing you the best!
grow up, act your age and please forgive your self
Hey man, I really hope you're doing ok . I'm  glad to see that you're self reflecting and just trying to improve yourself over the past year. We hope the best for you! You're so talented and you still have time to just start anew.
The fact that he showed lilies in the video just- ouch
This video is so good. It must be the most motivational video i've ever watched or maybe the first one i even related to. I lost my granny this year too and this video was the thing that got me out of my depressed mental slump. Thank you for this Albert, we, i* especially needed *this* in quarantine. Lets keep it going i can't wait for your next video :)
this is redirection. this is good.
I need the music 5:23
As someone who has made regrettable and irreversible mistakes in my life, hearing your perspective of your own mistakes really gives me some hope for myself. Thank you for sharing this.    Also side note, to anyone who leaves a negative comment, imagine if the world judged your entire existence and worth based off of the worst thing you’ve done. All of the good you’ve done and any attempts to redeem yourself from that mistake are outright rejected by hundreds of thousands of strangers. Not saying that the wrong you did was justified, but most people would say that it it doesn’t define who they are. Try to think of that before writing anything negative.
Well I wasn't here for the canceling and I don't know what happened... I hope you find your joy again.... I'll be your friend if you need one, I don't have many
insanely well made video
lovely!! hope to see more from you! welcome back man <33
what?
“I ChEaTeD CaUSe I’m a DuMbAss”
The fact that is has 8k dislikes is crazy you people are something else
People make mistakes. Everyone has either made mistakes or they will make mistakes, both big and small ones. Albert also made a mistake, he walked away from everyone because of it. The parts that was hurt has recovered and even though everything about what happened is sad it is the past now. The video is meant to be something for himself, something to help him get back into life itself. He is on a better path and he is trying to change. Albert isn't a bad guy, yes what he did was bad, but it was a mistake that so many people has made before. The only reason why people are judging him harder than most is because he is a public figure and for some people it makes them think they can judge him. Yes, just like us humans he did do something bad and horrible for that matter, but just because of a mistake, there is no reason for him to still be judged over something that is in the past. His life isn't over and it shouldn't be over. He should be able to get back into life even though he made a mistake, but it's really sad how people comment on him like he is such a horrible person. He is not. He just made a fucking mistake. Let him try and climb back up from his distancing from everything. If he manages to get back up, then accept him for what he is trying to become.
Rooting for you,  Albert!
Anyone know the songs he used in this video? Especially the one at 5:37 when the things are burning
Big respect for you man
I know it’s not my business to pry, and I only had learned of the situation  So I completely understand on how you feel, and people should forgive you. I don’t get why people keep saying that they can’t forgive you for.. that. It’s not our business, and it will never be
A split second decision can destroy a mans whole self worth, and even complete persona. The decision made made can change peoples whole mindset of you, when truly this action doesn't make you. Yes what he did was very wrong but truly we know he is not a bad person even in the act he wasn't a bad person. Truly he was in a misguided mental state that he allowed to control his actions to form him into a person to cause harm to himself and others. He can't take back what he has done, but he used his actions to wake himself out of this per say "trance", and used it to make the right decisions to make the right choices. A truly progressive person that steered himself back to the right path.
Make a video to try to get some people again ...dude you are pathetic , the only good of this ... lily found a real person and a real love and you are another idiot try to save her ouw ass.
I know it doesn't mean much coming from a random person on the internet but, I'm proud of you. You're doing so well by working on yourself. Just remember to keep going and keep to doing your best, also take breaks if you're going too fast. I know that one day everyone will be proud of how much you've changed and how far you've gone since last year. Best of luck to you, dude.
This looks like the trailer for a movie. I hope he keeps making music even if he does stop streaming.
Guys dont date any "influencer" just dont
In my honest opinion I really think your an amazing person for not looking down for too much time but for looking up and realizing what you had I know it’s a hard thing to try to change in things personally I’m still doing that but the fact that you admitted what you did and changed for the good is inspiring and I’m grateful for you I really think your an amazing content creator but not only as that as human being your amazing and never give up I will always wish you the best. Thank you Albert
um this is actually amazing from a film perspective.
i hope one day you'll become the person you've always dreamt to become :)
This video is very dapper. Good job.
This is me rn
The quality of this video is really pog !!
Please comeback
ok cheater
People just need to stay in their business. Not your place to shame someone you don't know.
Love the editing of this video! It's just pristine, imaginative, and spot-on. Also, we don't need to forgive you as we were not the ones you hurt. Those who say otherwise are delusional. Besides, they already forgave you. Bridges were burned but nonetheless can be rebuilt to a certain extent, if not, make new ones. Good Luck to you and I look forward to more of the same quality vids!
I’m just wondering how he got income this pass year.
I can see he has and is making a genuine effort to be better, one mistake doesn't define a person. That being said I'm not here for his personality, it's no longer something I feel I can trust as being genuine, I'm willing to separate the art from the artist and hope to see some cool stuff in the future, but if he wants to try selling an internet personality again I don't think I'm buying.
As if 2020 coudnt get any worst
This is how youtubers should apologise . It takes alot of courage to own up to your mistakes and u shew the world how everyone should take in and deal with their mistakes. I hope u can find the salvation you are looking for and know personally i respect u alot for this video. I wish u the best in ur journey and if u ever need someone to talk to ( Ik im a stranger but ill still lend out my hand to those o repect) i am here just message me or something.
This video is freaking rad! Genuinely beautifully made.
great vid mate
He made a mistake, which i am glad that he took the time to think about which led to him thinking all about his career and everything that he talked about in this video, so in a way that mistake (while it was wrong) was a gift in disguise so now he has had time to reflect on himself and hopefully become a better person, i hope to see some more of his videos soon.
i can relate a lot. i didn't really know about offline tv until toast became known for his among us playthroughs. took a glance at the history of offline tv so i can't fully sympathize with the fans who experienced the entire journey of offline tv. but last year, around the time albert cheated on lily, i was toxic to this girl i liked. we were never a thing but we thought we were kinda. so when we "broke up", that's around the time albert recieved the hate and the time i was ashamed of myself that i couldn't talk to any of her family members. i couldn't share it with anyone because i used to share my problems with her. but i screwed up really hard and hurt her feelings. i may not fully understand what he had to go through but i had a similar experience. it was freaking tough. you'll start to look at yourself as the villain of the story and face the fact that you ruined a person's life. all of the shame, guilt, sadness, fear, pity, anxiety, and all of the different hardships you have to face while trying to live a normal life in front of people who dont know what happened or what you've been carrying behind your back. man, its extremely heavy. the weight of these emotions will literally suffocate you.he probably had it a whole lot worse than me because more people knew about it but man, even if its just between two people, its still tough.  i currently am a fan of albert, not because of what he did since i never knew him until recently, but i am a fan because he has improved a lot and i want to watch his journey and be a part of it so i can improve myself as well.
Damn this 11 min felt like an hour good shit tho
Really good video, good editing, script... Must have been really hard, but you've been strong enough to endure it and take something possitive out of it, that's something all should do and appreciate.  Also, I'm sorry for your loss, my grandma also passed away this year and I feel your pain, just keep going I sincerely loved ur content  and I love this video so you definetely got my support ^--^ you can do this!
I wish people never cancel, I wish we forgive
Bravo Albert great to see you change
Some people Fk up
Some people Fk up
This video was beautifully well down, despite what he did in the past, its in the past. You can see he has reflected on his life for the better
This truly is a Beautiful video and good luck my friend.
:)
ok i never normally cry at short films but this made me cry.
I don't typically comment on videos, but this was really beautiful. Good luck on your journey and I hope you find what you are looking for at the end of it.
I really love this video, its amazingly made, its quality in camera work, editing and screen writing  is just beautifull and i wish he does more videos like this.
TBH,I'm disappointed on you,but who am I to judge,I'm disappointed in my self too,I really loved your work so looking forward to your vids
This dude should work with matt d'avela, damn what a great cinematography
dang this was such a nicely made video. Somehow, I always knew making a video this  great was possible but I never really saw a video like that. Glad he's back though. I wish him a happy life.
ok but why does this have more quality than all of otv's videos after fed's drama shit
I wonder if Sarah comes out with a vid similar to this one lol
You are only truly forgave when you forgive yourself.
(y)
9:58 respect the fucking grind, hope all goes well
2:36 wait what =/ Bro the editing and stuff this is so cool man
Thanks for coming back Albert. I mean it.
7k dislikes? Ouch man. Have some heart, those people probably didnt even watch the whole video
I genuinely want to know why people who can’t ever seem to be happy with someone even if they’re changing for the better. What do you want to do, stay mad and see them suffer the rest of their life?  And before you say it: yes he did still cheat... but lily forgave him. Why don’t you want to?
Damn, I’m going through the same thing but I’m finding it a bit harder to recover and what I did was worse but this video made me feel like I have a second chance thanks Albert. This video is amazing.
Though I never watched him, I can still feel his emotions from this video. Somehow I can understand him even though I don't know him.
this made me cry
La película de un funao deconstruide. Viva Albert Chang
i am glad seeing him having a personal growth, this vid explain everything like how he's been feeling. and i get it, he went thru a lot, everybody went thru alot. it would be great if we forgive him, because lily alr forgave him, so should we.
Hey hey 😊. You just earned a new subscriber.
Seriously talent flowing out of ur content, please keep creating and inspire people.
No hate or dislike, but just from one video he posted doesn't prove anything that he is already a better person or a changed man. It needs time to prove it. The future will tell.
I'm believed in you Albert. Just take your time slowly.
I love how he realize the mistake and express it in whole different way..it is total motivation
Yeast part: RAP GODD
I started to crying ..idk why but i am crying
Anyone know if he released the background music on this video. Finna use it in the future for school
I can relate to this video so much. Thank you for sharing Albert
No more liberty l
Some of the best film making skills I've seen on YouTube and more importantly a great message. I'm very impressed.   Great video Albert!
Hi fellow lily lovers, lily is fine and at a good place. please stop spreading hate to a dude that's trying to made up for his past self :)
although im still upset if what you did, we didnt know how bad it could be for you too. you made a huge mistake, but im sure we will all one day. im sorry albert stay safe.
What's the song starting at 5:25?
I just recently got into the OTV thing and I found out what happened... It was awful (everything that has happened to Lily, at least) and I realized something... We all make mistakes and fuck things up. I don't want to imagine that this amazing artist is not a selfish scum bag or something. I don't want to imagine what Albert had to go through... It's a lot, guys, do you imagine being hated by hundreds of thousands of strangers? or even receiving death threats and stuff? I probably would never be able to recover from that. Words can tear you apart in a few seconds, I was the target of bullies for all my teenage years... I just wish that he can genuinely change and do something better in this world.  I know Lily is OK, she's a loving human being full of compassion and kindness so, why would I hate Albert? It's not my responsibility to hate him or love him. He is just another human being like me and you. Just a human.
damn good video
at the very end, I swear Albert bought a new keyboard just for this video because those keys had absolutely no shining on it.
this is awesome
Welcome back
He created a movie in 12 minutes, I’m glad to see Albert changing for better and doing good I actually enjoyed his content and I am glad he didn’t permanently quit
7:13 Liberty hill :)
I'm just happy Albert is doing good and that he is walking out from the dark. Lily has already forgiven him and is living happily with her friends and Michael so everything is being solved :)
thanks for this awesome video, hope to see more of your creations in the future   and also thanks for those vocab :>
I'm glad he's back... The shit he took was way more than what he did in the past. And I'm ashamed I was part of that hate trend.
No one has the right to judge anyone leave personal matters to those people goddam it. You will do just fine albert keep going
God is just the best. Look at albert, he cheated and was an ungrateful person. But, from that mistake, God gave him a chance to inspire people, help himself become an even better person and most importantly have a better life. Because God gives us punishments as a blessing, a blessing that would prepare us for reality . You are doing great Albert, keep up the great work and enjoy your life while you still can!
tbh i'm trying to forget what happened since lily is over it now, so as a viewer imma try to forgive this dude, just don't do it again to other females or i'll taze you
A self-growth update is 1000% better than a little apology video. Here's to self-betterment, Mr. Chang
Amazing man. Amazing.
For everyone who has hated Albert, it seems like he has changed and wants to change for the better. Everyone thinks that hate is not really affected by people *IT IS* like everyday I think really lowly of myself and think everyone hates me, I’m sure Lily and Albert both are on separate ways and are living their own lives and seems like they have made up. I hope Albert becomes better and is slowly learning from his mistakes :)   Edit: And comparing this to the fed situation, What Fed has done was literally way worse than what Albert did in my Opinion-
You honestly deserve a second chance.
What is the song at 5:20, the lofi sounding one?
Albert has probably made the single most remedial and self-aware recovery I have ever seen out of all the content creators that have gotten into controversy. I know some will never forgive him, but I know that he is at least changed.
SICK CAMERA WORK AND NARRATION. very powerful/relatable/empowering/ and so on. IM GAY FOR YOU ALBERT I LIVE THIS AND I LOVE YOU
I honestly forgive him. As long as he knows that he did wrong, and is trying to change.
Hey good luck with your second chance ..... We all mess up sometimes it's what makes us human and i don't think that what people think of you is what actually defines you so you do you my man and i hope you ll do better
Guys, we need to stop hating him. Sure he did bad things and he deserves a punishment but he already got those punishments maybe too much. We need to move on, lily even forgave him and move on, why can't we?
Sounds and shot like fight club
Well, I didn't know you before this video so whatever happened is null. You've got skills, dude. I'll be your friend. Stay true, man. That's all we can do. 🤘
I forgive you
Everyone makes mistakes and poor choices in life. What matters is how you as a person and am adult learns from those mistakes and how you're able to pick yourself back up and come back. Accepting responsibly and knowing that your choices were wrong are steps in the right direction. Keeping this matter private is also the best step to take for you and all parties involved. I commend you on being able to take the time and reflecting on things and making changes In life to come back. This is not a situation or choice that you should be tormented or  ostracized for forever. It's going to be tough at first coming back, but if it's something that's passionate for you to do then don't let anyone hold you back. Keep on pushing forward, and best of luck.
As someone who has gone through (and to an extent, still is going through) a rather similar experience, youre an inspiration Albert and though this video may be selfish, that doesn't mean it can't help others like me.
2:05 he was filming this all the way back in February
This was probably the longest 11 minute video ever and not gonna lie, It was pretty motivating to watch (for me at least)  I hope you can live a nice life from now on my friend
I never hated u it's ur relationship not the viewers relationship fk y'all that judge him u all are more selfish bricks that don't care only about ur favorite streamers/youtubers  EVERYONE did some bad things in their life so u became crazy after one person do it ur truly are disgusting creatures.  albert pls start again with new Friends  Gain the courage to talk to older friends  I support ur carers people you've hurt forgive u they no longer getting hurt by this wound but it well always be there to remind to do the right to no more hurting people u love u respect albert some fans have changed but some didn't some are wanting u we still love u albert
There was a lot of effort put into this. Not some lazy apology video and I respect that
We still love you Albert.
putting all drama and memes aside.. this video looks so well done!
what did he do?
We all made mistakes, but we dont get reminded by the internet everyday.. All derserve hate and forgiveness.
Regardless of what happened, this is a well shot video, i'll be awaiting your return. See you soon.
This is a banger of a video. Love is out here for you man❤
What he did was not good, but i truely believe that he is willing to change. I dont know you personally, but I just want to say that please stay strong, you have the willpower to change and that is really admirable. I once was friends with someone who lied to me all the time (not saying you did this please hear me out) manipulated me constantly and he never admitted that his behavior was wrong. So please know that what you are doing is great. You probably already do this but regarding the last couple of shots, do keep in mind the person whos feelings are hurt. In my opinion people deserve second chances , but others often see that different. Stay strong and keep on fighting!
Undeniably, that was the worst thing u can do to any individual. Every mistake has a price to pay. Since its already been paid. Lets move on and been happy with your life. Everyone has a comeback in life, make that comeback counts.
Ngl this is hella inspiring
0:52 ouch, that hurt. that was a really nice touch
Nice one. forsenCD
Really good video
Cheer up
YOU HURT LILY. THAT IS BAD.
This video is amazing
What a waste of a egg;-;
Ngl I feel bad for him glad to hear you're changing
this was shot so beautifully
At least he isn't fed
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
8:59 is that a lily reference
You should make a movie trailer this edits doe
he had playing with puppies on the list. 🥺
glad to see u back, better than before.
What a great video.  -Self making clips for each sentence you say is hard.  -This video definitely took a couple months.  -it took him a lot of courage to make such a comeback -you can see he’s been through a lot probably more then lily went through -Drop a like on the video cause it highly deserves it
funny how people can judge others, just let them live ffs
this is just a hidden e-commerce ad
Yo whats the song that plays at the end
jesus christ this was gud, you can really tell the talent that ouzes out from him, wow bro. Good job & the worst things in life tend to lead to the best, keep growing 👊
Whatever you feel about the dude, this was a well shot and edited video. Still think he doesn't feel THAT bad, but whatever. You know his fans are still gonna watch and haters will watch and comment (he still gets your view count). Either way, dude is making money off of you. Doubt he even really cares what anyone says.
The bread yeast looks good!
Those who enjoy putting down a man for trying to become a BETTER person is honestly the WORST type of people.      So some of you guys in the comments.
Be strong my guy, i would love to see more of these super well made films. I wish you the best moving forward :P  I've come to stay.
Don't be so hard on yourself anymore. We make mistakes, we learn from them and people move on - in fact, they have moved on. I'm glad you can too. Now the community can also move on. Anyways, theres a lot more wrong in the world than this.
I dunno why but this video made me tear up. It's hard to get back up to your life when u've hit rock bottom. Seeing how Albert have been making progress for a year being a better person makes me wanna start on doing the same thing for myself.
miss you  ＞︿＜ stay strong !!!
i barely know you or the struggle you been through or the mistake that u made, but i feel grateful today that i watched this video. thank you
this guy is ultra tryhard..   still deciding if thats a good or a bad thing.  "... So I began sleeping 8 hours a day (he says this like thats a bad thing)"  .. That concerns me.
Damn. This is a crazy and deep video. As much as I didn't like what he did. The quality of the video and what he said (including the hundreds of puns) seems so thoughtful and well over what I expected he could do. Rooting to see that change in this guy.
Random question but how did people find out that he cheated?
Can we just take a moment to appreciate this video?  Like everyone’s talking about the drama and how big of a change happened but here I am in a corner crying for this beautiful video
Everything aside, the editing looks like EFFORT
Hopefully Fed does the same.
Pos
I hopped onto the mykull lily stuff and when I heard about your whole situation, I often wondered what happened to you.  Your apology was genuine.  Your repentance is enough.  Your punishment even continues, as the demons rage on in your mind.  You’re okay now, Albert.  We hurt people.  We do things we regret.  And we continue to live on, so that we may right our wrongs.  So, even when the internet rages and bites at you...  As long as you’re willing to change...  Welcome back, Albert.  Let love flow, over the endless hate.  Until the world is perfect.
Shits very relatable
this feels like such an artificial apology
You should feel ashamed. And you shouldn't be able to come back into the scene. go get an office job.
Song at 5:11??? Anyone?? HELP!!
Rest in peace that one egg that Albert cracked at 0:34
Beside the meaning and everything- the cinematography is REALLY GOOD
I'll never understand why someone would choose to cheat, but I honestly do respect him for working hard to better himself. Mistakes can't be taken back, but they can be learned from so we don't repeat the mistake again and come out a better person. Lily and the others have moved on, so hopefully the internet can cut him some slack. His entire life shouldn't be defined by a mistake that Lily already forgave and moved on from.
Hey Albert, I hope you're doing great nowadays. Just wanted to let you know that I've been through similar shit by fucking up my 1st relationship and having some problems with close friends too. This video motivated me to change and keep moving forward. 🙏
Albert next gen games are here would be nice to see some gameplays on twitch or yt! New Spider Man looks cool af.
Hey man whatever happened is over now. I'm happy to see you come back and I hope you get along with the community again and have a good time with people who really wishes the good for you (like me) and have a good time forgetting or at least pretending to forgot all negative thoughts and having a fresh new start. Look forward for your contents and GOOD LUCK!
Anyone here from doc k's video 👀
Fed: write that down, write that down.
This is a real apology, not crying infront of the camera and makes excuses about their mistakes. Albert it's okay we know you changed, we're not gonna hate you and we will support you, because we know you're changing for a better life. Ignore those toxic trolls in the internet telling u to end urself. They're some matured fans and I'm one of them and majority of the comment are as well. We we're waiting for this video, thank you for apologizing. 💕✨
Miss you foo
That is one cool bedroom
Good for you Albert
Forgiveness and continual support are different. I forgive Albert, I probably wont support him further just because the lingering idea of his actions. I do wish him the best regardless. (This video was very well done)
Looking forward to seeing albert on coming back stronger and happier, lets wish him all the best for his future endeavours and support him wholeheartedly.
hello albert, and good job for learning from your mistakes :)
I know for a fact ill be in your corner
Nice video ... Good luck, have fun. Keep swimming.
Poor guy.  You can tell the weight on his shoulders are very tiring.  Don't feel bad for him at all but glad he's able to move on.  All the best for him.
0:52 this frame alone was painful
We need you albert, please
It's good for Albert that he is changing and turning to a better man. God speed with your career, Albert.
A lot of people cheated in this world.. Does they deserve punishment like albert?... Stupid internet
your cinematographie is amazing
This video is so aesthetically pleasing. I hope that you'll make tutorial videos for making this type of videos. Also, goodluck uwu
I support u, and I'm willing to give you a second chance. I think others should too, because u can do whatever u put your mind into.
*sniffle* IM NOT CRYING. YOU ARE
ok i know this is the tea and reconstruction of self...but this is beautiful
Omg why doesn't he talk so much  Ur grandma died ok why are u telling us about that  This video is so fake
So u needed more money
Let's be honest, if this was a woman, people would still be calling her a whore and cancel her left and right.
Mate everyone makes mistakes, just move forward and learn from it. Hope everything works out for you man.
You may have cheated, but you’ve learned from your mistakes, you’ve spent a year alone, no career, people saying horrible things, what is most important is, what the mistake did to you, it changed you for the better, Lily is happy and has moved on, now it’s our turn to move on and learn to forgive
ya, one fuk up doesn't define who you are, there's always the opportunity to bounce back and better yourself, and this shows growth as a person.
7/10
Holy shit, am I watching myself?!
Ohh man keep going, you do have skills. Story telling and videography are cool
You are the best video editor i've seen.
I've learned so many things from this video.
Yes yes yes yes
That ending tho😭I just cried so much lmao from those little words "May the person you find, be the person I resolve to become"  I loved how the whole video was shot as well! Really good work!
oh sh*t
It's really hard when a single mistake defines us. I know,  what he did was wrong but both sides already healed those wounds. Lily is now happy with Michael and Albert is working on his passions. I'm happy that he's recovering and doing what makes him happy. Please, let's just both support them on their separate ways and stop hating Albert. Past is past. Make the world a better place.
You have my full support bro👍 We learn from our mistakes and become a better person.
tbh i never gave a fuck about what happened between you and Lily what i wanted to know was what happened between you and Scarra
Regardless of everything, that's actually a really well directed and well-shot video. Amazing
I am not gonna like or dislike, any of his videos.
Legends comes again....
Bye.
Life lessons...
Nah
we need videos :) i love ur content
You know, at first I was watching this with immense hatred because of a recommended video on youtube that brought the event (which I was not aware of). I've been cheated on, several times ... My mother also cheated and my father too maybe. I was surrounded by them, that I developed a deep seeted resentment.   But your video made me open my eyes, we're all humans and we do make mistakes. But that's okay, because you learn from it.  Now I'm seeing things in a different light, my deep seeted hatred towards all cheaters ... Reduced. Sure, some are unforgivable because they don't regret... But you, you truly are a beautiful soul and your video made me realize this and much more.  I can say that, from the bottom of my heart, I feel truly happy and proud of what and who you became.   Thank you for sharing this with us, and may I say... Welcome back? ❤️
good for you albert im happy that you have accepted that you have done something wrong and im happy that you are willing to to change cant wait for your next vid
This was such a beautifully done video, probably one of the best update videos ever. No false promises, no loophole apologies, I actually had to watch back,
didn't think that he would come back this is very surprising.
It's been a year; for those who still hate him for what he did a year ago, then okay, those are your own feelings. Don't go sitting behind a screen and typing hurtful messages to someone you might not even know personally. People make mistakes, people mess up time to time.  Watch this as a video (and not based on his past mistakes/choices) and to that, it's actually pretty well-made IMO. Glad to know that he has been able to work on himself the past year; that's something most of us take for granted: our own happiness. We should be happy for him that he's doing something most of us don't do. We all can't be people pleasers unless we please ourselves. So kudos to Albert. Good luck.
We all fuck up sometimes big time but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the end
I don't think we're giving enough credit for the editing and pacing of this "video". Fuck I can't even call it a video I'd call this an amazing short film.
This guys lost everything
This was written and executed so well. The filming and edits were incredible.
this is so cool man, its really cool to see that people really can start to change themselves. also, this video editing is amazing
Don't worry, Albert. We're so proud of you changing for the better for yourself by yourself. 💖
You know, people cheat and break up everyday. There are a lot of people like Albert that do apologize and genuinely want to get better, and there are people who are still crappy no matter what happens.   The internet is so freaking entitled and I hope people understand that youtubers or streamers or celebrities are entitled to their privacy and to handle their matters in a peaceful way. No one has any right to tell you to kill yourself or judge the integrity of an apology. Everyone makes mistakes and the important thing is that Albert is willing to change and is changing and Lily has forgiven and moved on.
0:54 are those lily flowers?
Hey man, I really want to see you in a built up body so keep working on yourself pls
Welcome back buddy... all the best for future
aside from the serious mood, the filming and editing in this is wonderful
hope you've been doing better
8:53 i think i know who he is talking about
If you're not the person he hurt than none of his apologies were yours to accept.
0:52 the lilies
that was a damn good video
At the beginning of this year my best friend lost a fight with depression, she committed suicide. Needless to say my life shattered into a million pieces. I've been struggling with depression and social anxiety after it, and I don't see light at the end of the tunnel, yet. As hard it is, I'm trying to overcome it little by little. This video gave me hope. Don't get me wrong! I'm not happy that you got "cancelled". I want you to grow and overcome whatever you're going through. I wish you that as much as I'm wishing it to myself. You are not alone 😊
Doc Cheated and people forgot about it, the only reason albert is still getting shit is because it was lily its fucked up. Good luck on the return.
Sadboi na manipulative
If this guy can make up for his past mistakes and be a better person than I can forgive him. I would be happy and forgive him if he can change for the better rather than being a person lower to bring others down(he did wrong but wouldn't it be more worse if we curse and ruin their lives)?
I see a lot of people saying "It was just a mistake." No. Cheating is not a "mistake". It's a choice. It's not something you do accidentally. It's something you choose to do.  Also i saw a lot of people say that Lillypichu forgave him so we should do, or we shouldn't care about it at all because it's not about us. Doesn't matter how talented he is or who forgave him, I personally can never bring myself to enjoy someone's content who made that choice of cheating.
Oh shit what happened?
Ok but the cinematography.......
inspiring
The creativity in this video is amazing. It's extremely hard to create visual representations of abstract concepts such as thoughts and emotions
albert redemption ark?
Great. A tragic anime backstory for a good redemption arc
To be honest, I didn't know if I would watch this. But after recognizing that Lily and the people around him forgave him, I realized I should give him a shot too. This isn't an apology video, but an update, and I think it's incredible that he's no only recognized what he's done wrong, but actively stayed away in an attempt to better himself. Regardless of it's "fake" like some people may claim, it's an incredible message that he is sending forward with this video of repentance and mental care.
I don't understand , it's not these people's business. He shouldn't have to apologize to you snowflakes
You know, you kind of remind me of me.( even tho you are older ) I do things I love and am trying to get better at them. I started many creative projects as well. I love playing the piano( tho I’m not good at it ) people like to hear me play what I know. I love music and other things like that. I started playing tennis and it is really fun.( despite me not thinking it was at first ) I think it is great what you are doing with your life and I hope you achieve the best in life for trying to better yourself. Even tho you are older. I think it would be nice to be your friend. ( even tho I wouldn’t be able to see you in person ). I think it could be fun. I don’t think anyone would read this far but Good Luck. And I hope. You can make the difference you want.I may be a new fan but I know that I will stay one, for however long it takes.
The people who forgive and the people who ask apologies.. Both have great hearts. They deserve to stay. And come back home. Because they genuinely want to change for good. I have enormous respect for them....For being brave enough to say "I am sorry". And for being brave enough to say - TAKE CARE AND STAY SAFE. ❤
POV: You are a dirtbag
And here i thought i had left a comment the day this came out, apparently i didn't.  well then.  May god bless you on your way albert. No human goes without sin, it is about how you act according to your sins that is important. Some may never forgive them, but one will always do so. Hold your head high for you are also only human.
Honestly I think I dislike Albert because I'm such a Lilypichu simp but once lily got over it I was like we in the clear. But personally I'm not hating on him because Lily forgave him but I don't support him. Lilypichu fans like me, let's not leave hate comments just stay don't search "sleightlymusical" anymore this would be better for everyone. Lily feels bad about it and forgave him and is happy with Micheal so let him have a second chance.
U can do it man.
This made me think about my actions honestly, i remember making jokes about your breakup and i feel bad because you still are a person, and its something that is so hard to remember when you are just looking at a computer screen. People including me really should not stick their noses into other people's lives, and i fail to see that more often than i would like to admit.
Prob one of the best ways to redeem yourself after fcking up on the internet, you did something messed up, but atleast your are getting better.....keep it up
i don't know much about your background but i would love to see more of you. i'm a fan albert : )
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!, Albert is back ive been waiting for this moment , enough with the issue everyone. All of us made a mistakes evertime. you thaught albert is a magician but albert is the magic. I Started magic because of albert, and also i started violin because of albert. ♠ 🎻
ok but like the photography of this short film is sooooo Good! damn
When he said “work towards a day I can forgive myself” I fuckin bawled like a bitch. I hope he can be happy again and hope he truly has changed for the better.
I know this is really dumb but the fountain pen lover in me noticed immediately that at 2:32 albert is using a fountain pen called the lamy 2000 in what I assume to be a EF or F nib sorry if this is dumb its just my personal passion   Also since he got that I will say he has great taste in pens
What did this guy do?
Despite everything its still you. Glad to have you back Albert and its wonderful that you want to change for the better and to do things for yourself. I hope you find what you need <3
I think people failed to understand that this is a self-reflection and just an update to his life currently He already apologised to Lily months ago and this vid is for him to realise that he needs to be better and happy
Damn man. I honestly was one of the people incredibly upset with the events that occurred last year. As anyone would be with something like that that involves people they admire and/or look up to. I never wished for bad things to come to Albert, just extreme and utter disappointment and anger. People are people and we will always make mistakes and stupid decisions, no matter how big of a platform we're on or how big of a reach we have. My heart sank watching this because that fact completely dawned on me. I'm aware that content creators are people and they all have their own lives, but I feel we all alienate ourselves from them at least a bit and put them on pedestals. I really do hope Albert continues to grow and learn as a content creator and as a person. This was an absolutely beautiful video and I wish him the absolute best.
I'm happy that you learned from your mistakes and recovering from everything. Still supporting you
bruh i dont see any hate comments what r u guys on about
I think it's clear that you feel remorse  and want to improve yourself. I'm sure your mom would be proud.
The yeast part got me good 😂😂
Welcome back!
As said by a great YouTuber “keep that same energy”
Bruh everyone cheats you might cheat or get cheated on we are just people if you can't understand that ur not ready for the  world
My dude came back. Let’s fucking go🙌
This really fucking moved me man! Not the things that you've tough yourself but more of what I've not taught myself yet.. Im glad you're moving towards a better version of yourself and hope that I can start to do the same soon.
0:52 the flowers shown here are Lily's, incase people missed the hint.
the 7.5k dislikes are from the virgin whiteknights
happy early birthday
youre so stupid lol
Holy shit. That mightve been the best video i‘ve ever seen
Everyone has a second chance for a reason and forget the past because it’s like a dream or nightmare so wake up and don’t let the dream or nightmare control you let you be you. Welcome back Albert it’s nice to see your doing a bit better☺️
Yes, he made a mistake but he is genuinely working on being better and that what we can ever hope for people. How can anyone grow from their mistakes when people stay mad and remind him of their past mistakes while they're actually trying to? Some of y'all need to take a hard look in the mirror and learn how to be compassionate.
here from XQC. take the L and move on bud
Cheating doesn't make a person a sociopath... Wtf is wrong with people
I just hope that this won't be one of those videos that aged horribly, and that instead he does go through the right track to become a better person
welcome back <3
Idk it kinda bothers me how this looks like a movie trailer But it's a good video ig
honestly im sorry.   im sorry that I jump the wagon when people were attacking him/you, I hope that your doing better.
Yes he's back
bro i cried for the whole video
This is one of the most beautiful realisation video i have seen till this date. I dont care about the drama that happened. I am just happy that a man is actually taking steps to realize who he is
telling someone to end their life for cheating itsnt funny..
ngl I avoided watching this bc I didn’t want to give him views for what he’s done. however after watching this y’all gotta give props to Albert. It’s a really well made video and I’m glad he’s changed (changing?)
I don’t get why y’all still hating let’s say a not famous person just a regular dude cheated he would get no hate what so ever but when a famous creator cheats all of a sudden he has a to apologize to us I mean we don’t even know him he shouldn’t even have to apologize if u look at my example there both men and there both human so stop hating on him when he clearly said he would become a better person
Even if you have done wrong, there are still people who enjoy what you do, all you need to do is just be you and do what you love to do. Take your time thinking about what you need to do to make yourself happy, there are still people out there having fate in you. I'm very sorry for your loss even if I am a stranger on the internet, we are humans after all and we humans have done mistakes. It always takes time to realize the scars that we have inflicted on others and ourselves but know that time will heal it so don't give up yet.  Hope I at least gave you hope or happiness in this comment.  Edit: I don't know if you'll be able to read this since there are so many comments 😅 thank you for reading this tho   "Smile because frowning doesn't do anything"
and yall still hate on him he already apologized to his ex gf and to his fans stop making his life worse than that :/
Most of y’all wouldn’t even admit to anything  And this guy is clearly being real Albie  Just remember that’s it’s destiny  You wouldn’t have been who you are if all these would’ve never have happened to you  I think you’re strong enough  Stay strong mann  Everything will be alright 🙏
What happened, happened. Its a personal matter between them. Im hoping to see more from Albert tho. I liked his stream with the whole atmosphere of being kind of very comfy. Alot i can learn from this guy despite of what he did.
What if fed and albert joined up and decided to be  "online monitor screen"
Y E A S T B O I
Amazed how raw and honest your video is. I'm so glad you are doing better and learning. You have grown to a much better person. Proud of you and keep it up!
Thank you for this video. It’s hard to trust someone again but, it’s never too late to change.  I look forward to your future and your newfound happiness.
I have nothing to say,  i mean, Lily and everyone else forgave him. Everyone involved forgave. Despite the damage he caused, everyone is happy and is slowly starting to heal from the damage. If he comes back, I think i will be happy to watch his videos and support him. What authority do i have to choose whether I want to forgive him or not and what authority do I have to tell him that he has no way to redeem himself, when i myself was never involved in this.  If he tries to redeem himself and makes sure to not make the same mistake, sure I'll be more than happy to support him and watch his video in enjoyment in the future.
I believe that Lily has moved on now that enough time has passed, all you have to do now is get to the point where you can forgive yourself and be a better person in the future.It is obvious you put a lot of thought and time into this video so we know you’re coming from a good place.I miss hearing your music, so here’s to getting back to yourself
Hey man, really nice video. If you did it yourself, you are really talented. Also i wanted to say that you don't owe the internet anything. The only person you owe for probably the rest of your life is Lily, that's all.  You are just a guy who was stupid and happened to be stupid publicly. Don''t apologize to the internet for making mistakes in your life like any other human. We are often stupid especially when we are young. The only thing that matters is that mistake made you wiser. I'm glad you were able to bounce back, good luck man, take care.
Respects. To be honest I don't really know what happened to get you cancelled but, if what was said in this video is true then I don't see why anyone can't appreciate what you did with this video. Really moving video actually made me tear up a little bit and I don't even usually comment on any videos at all
i know this is harsh but for all the people saying "we all make mistakes." The guy who killed George Floyd also "just made a mistake" doesn't make sense to say sure we all make mistakes but some mistakes aren't something u can just brush of
Still sucks what you did, but we’re only human. What an awesome video, beautifully created hope you can grow and continue from this
"Take time with a wounded hand.  Cause it likes to heal."   - Scott Weiland 1992
okay to be honest,i'm really mad when you and lily..welp let's not talk about it anymore,but now it's different,we're happy to see you again and what i'm about to say is everyone make a mistake,tbh i once cheated with my bf too,he was a really good guy but one day let's just say he turn his..belief with something else,i told him about what happen,i was so young and stupid the next year he broke up with me bcs he found someone else that *Just like him* i respect that,and i got my lesson,they still dating until now i didn't even care but he completely change,he thinks that i'm still in love with him but no,sometimes even someone that old than you are not immature enough so people stop sending stupid comments he got enough already let's just hope you'll do better in the future,and stay healthy people💕
Yo like this video is good and I am happy that Albert is coming back. His music is really good and he is a great musician. But this video seems a little off. The first half of the video was him talking about his past life, and saying he was an amazing, genuine person. And that he felt he was obligated to listen to people and do what they asked. I don't know, I think the video would have a lot less dislikes if the first half of the video was removed. He made himself look also like the victim in the first half. At least that is how I perceived it.
Tbh idc if he cheated 🤷 😭
Ive been looking for this channel since forever and I cant believe I finally found it
People need to be more forgiving. No one is perfect. You’re not perfect.
Things aside, the choreography is real good!
Tbh Albert man keep up the achievements that u already successful granted yourself and wish to achieve more.
看了评论才知道你出轨了？你竟然出轨了  舆论迫使你离开的吧
I understand this greatly.
Albert comeback we miss you, people may fucking hate you but there are still others who believe in you
did he broke up with the girl he cheated with
I'm happy to hear you're doing better and seeking help.  I hope you continue to work towards a better you and find yourself happiness! As you mentioned projects in your video, I look forward to seeing what you do if you grace us with them.  Good Luck, Albert.
i appreciated the implication of lily at 0:54 when he says he "lost the people closest to him," and showed an image of the lily flowers
you're changing, and that's what matters.
Honestly, this commercial is weirder than the cheating.
This is the most genuine video that I’ve seen in a very long time. As someone who has made a mistake and lost everything from it I completely understand where he’s coming from. This video is extremely empowering for me at least. Whatever you’re up to Albert and whatever you’re doing, I support you.
haha so albert is the mastermind
I want a pet yeast now 🥰
I missed this production quality, hopefully this is the start of a new and great carreer.
He does make great videos.  He cheated on Lily and really paid for it when it comes to his livelihood.  He will have to work hard to get back to where he was.  But lets be serious people, he cheated on someone.  While shitty, it isn't like he pulled a Fedmyster.
i was already an emotional wreck and tbh this video almost made me cry
0:49 bro don't do that to a violin.. D:
This video was actually... Freaking... Amazing. Welcome back, Albert. Luv ya mate.
I forgive him =)
Did anyone else notice Bojack Horseman playing in the background? 2:40
Claps for this man that is trying to change and IS IN FACT CHANGING FOR THE BETTER
This was a beautiful video. Such a great and strong character development Albert. The true fans forgive you Albert, but the cancel culture will always stay that’s the truth. But this is one hell of a good step in the right direction my friend.
"Love me at my worst because that's when I need you most."
You'll do great Be strong🌼
I don't really get people who still hold grudge to him. I mean lily forgave him and moved on. At this point as an audience we just have to do the same, that's it. Besides, his content is really good, like the quality of this video is so good. 10 min felt like 1 since the quality is there.
Honestly I do dislike when someone did what you did. But I am also of the mindset that it isn't on us to ruin your career. Cancel culture sickens me to a much larger degree than being dishonest to people around you. So while I wont actively support you, I wont judge you for your private affairs either as long as they aren't illegal. I will watch your content if i find it good. We need to learn how to separate a public figure, (no matter their size) from their private life. We all fuck up to some degree, but we don't lose our jobs over it. Why should they?
At least he realized his mistake. He tried to apologize in the past and his “ex” forgive him. People make fun of his apologize and now all of the internet want his apology again. It much better to make this video than another cliché video saying “I’m sorry guys” “Now i realize my mistake” “sorry i will never repeat it” so much cliché. And for most of you haters you likely don’t know the story and if you know the story “did you never make a mistake at all!? You haters,I bet you don’t have the guts to admit your mistake”  BTW this video is not an apology just a reflection of what he been trough. in the start of the video “is is a selfish video” and this tells about him self.
Imma be honest Yes he made me angry cause he cheated to her Yes he made a very big mistake but everyone deserves to be happy 😊 he already know he made a big mistake he knows he fuck up he knows that he hurt so many people yes he knows.But he suffered enough and thats my opinion sorry if i would get hate but look at the bright side Lily is veryy happy and has many loyal friends 😃
I'll be coming back in 2 months... I hope he can re establish himself as a content creator
Anyone know the sound track for the last half of the video?
Not sure what really happened but I’m not without sin to judge his mistake. It’s not as if he killed someone.
Glad you're back Best of luck to you
I'm glad your back :)
I think when all things are said, he was a human who like everyone made mistakes. And too many people acted like he wasn't. Like he was infallible.
damn bro thats crazy              bottom text
as the Old One would say  “What is better ? to be born good or to overcome your evil nature through great effort ?” welcome back, i am not proud of what you've done in the past, but i am proud of how you overcame it! hopefully it will get better and better soon for you and everyone involved
*yeastboi* pog
man....... i know what he had done but hey...this video is high quality
this is a really good video. congratulations
I BELIVE IN YOU
As a human being that has made many mistakes it this is awesome to see someone make such a recovery. Lots of love for people working to grow no matter where they are in life.
Albert, Im not gonna lie, I was one of the people who antagonized you, I didn't send any death threats and shit like that, I was shocked and hated you. I felt angry and upset that you did what you did, but after some time, I understood that, this had affected you greatly, at the time, I didn't realize or, even tried to think about what you would go through, how your family would react, how other people would treat you, and how you'd feel about it, I didn't, and probably will never know your side of the story, but I always thought that what you've done could never be forgiven, and honestly, I was kinda mad at lily for forgiving you so easily. I took a break from Offline TV and twitch, I didn't wanna dwell in that drama, but when I cam back, I found that lily found someone new, I don't know if that hurts you, or stings you a little bit, and I'm sorry that I brought it up if I did, but I was glad to see that she moved on and found a new path for herself, and that she's happy right now. Albert, I can see that you got hurt just as much as Lily, especially from the backlash on the community and the pressure of your everyday life, I'm glad to see that you overcame that and sought out help, and that you're doing better. I'm so sorry about the hate and comments online, sure what you did was completely wrong, and no one should ever go through it, but I'm sure you wanted to end yourself, like actually. I'm glad you didn't give in, and that you're seeking to be a better person, and not for the sake of everyone else, but also for yourself. I'm sorry for thinking you were a piece of trash, I'll support you on your way back into social media, I always loved your content, and I missed it. Thank you for learning from your mistakes, and thank you for having the guts to come back, you're strong as fuck, good job on everything you've done for yourself this past year, also this video was really well-made, I can tell you put a lot of effort and heart into it. I'll support you, not with money, since Im fucking broke, but with some positive feedback and comments. I'm glad you're here. Welcome back Albert
If there will be another fight or something Michael can just tase them or use robodog
I don't know what the actual beef and or problem and I know this video would not give me some a pie filling but this gives me  a suicided note vide
Can’t wait to see fed make like this
Albert is a changed man.
Albert you have more guts than anyone out there, this seemed so understandable and I feel like you shouldn't listen to what others say focus more on what you want to focus on. Even if it hurts to keep the burden on other, mistake happens just leave it even if it was a really bad one, I believe you can do it. Make something good out this good time we have I believe in you and I am leaving this trust with. Albert Chang
this guy messed up really bad and actually showed growth that he’s becoming a better human. this really is a rare case, most of the time they just make some apology video and come back in 2 weeks.
k
Man is it just me or is this well made
I agree Lily is the only one who can hold the grudge, but having an opinion (as irrelevant as it may be) is something we are all entitled to. When are you doing a collab with Dr Disrespect eh Alby?
All the Best!!!!!!
This is actually a very good apology video, I hope you will slowly gain trust from people because we all can understand we make mistakes but your mistake made your carrier gone so if possible we can make a carrier for you.
I truly hope I don't get hate from this but I have been in a free fall like Albert I may have not been raise the same way or even walk the same path but this has help bring me out of that fall and face my fears head on cause it has been awhile snice I had. It gave me that hope to grab the ladder I was falling from and bring my self back up and work my way from there. What I am trying to say I did not fall the same way but this gave me hope I could pull my self up. I hate to be one of those people who say that a Youtube video help but this truly did. All of us do bad in life. All of us do good at some point. Stay safe Albert. All of us fall its about catching yourself on the way down.
I just want to here one last violin 🎻
Well done. Love bro love
Big Respect
Dont get me wrong.          Give him a another chance. So he could build himself up again...    _no one is born ugly, we just live in a judgemental society._ -*RM*      Albert.. i missed u.
This was honestly really amazing
I genuinely hope the very best for you Albert. I hope to see a bunch from you again. Missed those old times with your amazing magic tricks that I so loved and couldn't get enough from.
I missed you man
I'm proud of him I don't care what anyone says I'm glad he came back stronger
Next best thing from Dog I was thinking: "fish?" Albert: "YEAST"
HES BACK
I truly wish the best for you Albert.
oh no.
well made video really
It really pisses me of that it takes things like this for people to develop intent.(myself included.)
Welcome back man
damn, this was lit.
Hey Albert, I don't know you and I wasn't around when all that stuff happened. So, as a complete outsider, I wanted to say... You have an enormous amount of talent and creative mind. Your skills, which may seem simple to you, are incredible and uplifting. Sure, no one agrees with what you've done, but it's now about what are you going to do. The past is past. There is a time for mourning and a time for joy and joy comes in the morning. The start of a brand new day. So I hope, with this new path you're on, you find joy, happiness, and peace. You've gained a new subscriber. Not because of you who were, but because of what I believe you're going to do. All the best! Can't wait for the new content you're going to put out there. Time to show everyone who you really are, now who you used to be.
glad you moved on
Good luck mate
Awe what happened to him?? Why did he get cancelled? 😭 This video is so fucking good, it's so pleasing aesthetically and cinematically while it also holds a good value. It brings me a TINY bit to tears because I'm kind of going through this as well. I like being alone but I know it's not good for me in the long run, I need to socialise and keep my shit together because I promised myself and God I'd work hard. Thank you for the reminder God bless you so much!!! I feel less alone through your video.
Damn this video's production is extremely good
As much as I loathed him for what he did, I don't think it's wrong for him to change for the better. In fact, we should be encouraging this. The internet needs to stop defining someone by their mistakes because Albert is clearly trying his best to pick himself back up, and I don't see why he has to be shat on for doing so. Lily forgave him already, so now I'm willing to as well.
I just really like the vid man. Your a great content creator and you have a bunch of talents. Sure you messed up but everyone makes mistakes. And honestly the ones who makes the most mistakes are the ones who get the furthest.
I just really like the vid man. Your a great content creator and you ahve a bunch of talents. Sure you messed up but everyone makes mistakes. And honestly the ones who makes the most mistakes are the ones who get the furthest.
Honestly I don't care, he is both a good and bad person and I don't know the whole story and he is honestly a good person but simultaneously a flawed person so he is everyone yet know one
Man ya played yourself.
I'm glad he's doing okay. He should be happy too! But I personally do not think I can watch his content. I've been cheated on in the past and it is a terribly feeling. I dont personally know the guy, but I know he's trying his best to change. Isn't that enough?
do you post vods?
Good luck, Albert.
even if he made this mistake, I believe he's a good person, don't hold it against him.
When I first watched this, I teared up at the end. I think each and everyone one of us would be lying if we all said that everything we've ever done has always been right or forgivable otherwise. One time or another we've all been on this path to betterment because of a fault that has haunted us since. You don't have to forgive the man, but his efforts and desire for good, honest change should at least speak deeply to you.
Damn that was a well made video
I didnt know who you are or what you did but... i hope you can be better and forgive yourseld
hello, I just wanted to ask about your coffee set and if you could post links of what grinder, kettle, and pour over set you use
His film making is amazing
damn...to be honest this video alone gives me hope for him. i look forward to hopefully doing as he says and searching his name to find the person he wants to become. hopefully he is able to really learn and better himself and gain that resolve. welcome back albert, do this for you and i hope you are able to find light in yourself and grow.
Support
Good guy, bad decisions keep up the good work and the good decisions.
man that is a sad story ...
I just wanna know who did the storyboarding and directing?! checked every box of making an impactful comeback video! props to the production team...
song name? 5:30
why did you make a very cinematic video literally just for this
The only thing im curious about is how long did it take him to create this video
Honestly people grow, people change. Mistakes shouldn't define you, who you decide to be after it's happened is what should. Keep moving forward Albert. :)
it's almost been a year holy shit time moves fast
Man I am impressed. I hope people understand.
is abert = boxbox ? or any relationship ?
All i can say is i just found out that Albert actually cheated on Lily and i knew Lily before Albert and all i have to say is i cried hearing this video and i think those people that are defending Lily i just want to say pls Albert is also a person you don't know what he is in real life and all the greatness he has done instead of talking about his mistake why not talk about his greatness and kindness he has done, stop hating him for a mistake that he F*cked up because just imagine you in his shoes wouldn't you feel bad for your self and the hate and you would be in the depths of despair but what i am saying is a lot of people already has hated him don't you think he has heard enough give him time to change people can change if you believe in them stop hating and start believing god work in strange ways so pls stop hating him
Even though he fucked up, you can't deny this man's talent.
albert please go back to lily and say sorry, they miss you, they don't despise you. They love you no matter what. Even if you did something very very very bad, it doesn't matter, just keep going and to everyone
Am glad this comment section is nicer then the one on twitter, people can be so mean
I dont even know this channel... But hi i guess
Plot twist: He made a Drama just to make a good apology video    Kidding aside as long as you can prove yourself that you are better than before then dont listen to people who wants you back down again yes you made a mistake but aren't we all make mistakes?
Man i hope you have a nice day
Say what you will, but the guy seems like he’s doing a really good job at life. I mean, everyone fucks up, everyone makes mistakes, and everyone plummets to rock bottom. But this guy recovered. Instead of staying at the bottom, he rose back up. Now, isn’t that truly what matters?
Come back brooo!!! Its been too long, but take your time easy steps so that you are confident in your self and ready to hold your self up   bring your ideas and dreams so that we see the beauty of film, music and magic you bring to the world  May you grow strong, wise and full of joy in your work once once again.
What a beautiful message. You're trying Albert.. we all make so many mistakes, some bigger some smaller. But noone can ever say they are faultless. I'm not faultless, you're not faultless. You're trying your best and it's all you can do.  I wish you so much from the bottom of my heart. You're a good guy <3
Im proud of you.
0:58 Pog
I think the reason he took such a long break was more of 2:39 taking months
To be honest this was really unnecessary.  We have all moved on especially lily who was hurt the most too! I appreciate the effort but i really got bored 3 mins in. I dunno if its just me but it felt like he tried a bit too much. I still hope the best for him and i am glad he is well. Peace :)
Good luck my man
You are finally back!! Missed you streams
Noone gonna talk about how much fucking story boarding this video must have taken.
hey
Take care, man.
I hope you will find true happiness in your heart. You still deserve to find peace and do the things that you love, no matter what, as long as you do things right this time. Cheers to the new chapter in your life Albert Chang! 😊🥂
Thanks, Albert, I am depressed right now for how I was living, but after I saw your video I felt some spark of motivation again, truly thanks. And btw this video is some high-quality shit yo!
I am in love with this video
BRO i actually thought he cut his hand but, im sorry about your problem and also why are you cancelled?
this man thought about releasing this video for a long time. his phone says February 3rd, and that means he recorded the video a while back, and didn't want to release it until he was ready to accept it by himself
good actor
Great Video. I subbed!
This was a great short film, I loved it.
The cinematics tho, this was well edited, and well thought out.
Sympathy is hard to come by But when you turn someone from hating you to filling forgiveness  That’s when you know you have succeeded  Congratulations  Although your not here to please me Rather you don’t know I exist  You have my sympathy
Everyone makes a mistake in life. Let's give this man a second chance in life, if he fucks up again then grill him like no tomorrow.
I didnt know about OfflineTV before I started watching Albert on Twitch. I started watching Albert when he was recommended to me on Twitch and found his streams and him really interesting. I loved his magic streams and it was just nice listening to him talk about random things. I also started getting into OfflineTV because of him, mostly watching Lilypichu.  When I heard that he cheated on Lily, I was disappointed and angry. I dont know why, but I always valued loyalty more than others might and I am even possessive of things that are mine. So to know that someone, who I found cool and admired for his amazing work, cheated on his girlfriend. I found myself disgusted that someone would do something like that, especially to Lily who really loved him and who used to and still suffers from self esteem issues.  After a year, I have come to realize with the recent comeback, that my anger and disappointment are gone. I wasnt the one he cheated and the one who he cheated on forgave him, I cant stay mad at someone who is trying to become a better person. He owned up to his mistakes and is trying to better himself, I forgive him and I will support you in this journey.
I'm kinda new to OfflineTV and its history but all I can say is that I wish for you to find your happiness because everyone deserves it and hoping that you could be able to forgive yourself one day. It is great knowing you have been doing good and is on the path to becoming better physically, mentally, and emotionally. As a total stranger, want you to know that there are people like me who are proud of what you're doing to be better. Best wishes in life! :))
I really dont like what albert did. But I dont think that the internet should crucify this guy bc of it. Bc besides the cheating he honestly doesnt even seem like a bad dude. If lily forgave him, I dont see why we cant either. I just hope he actually grew over the time he was away from the public eye. It seems like he really just questioned his whole entire life for a year and has actually tried to be a better person for the sake of himself and everyone else. And I commend him for that  Also note: this video was amazing, I was so captivated by every shot. The cinematography and narration was *chef kiss*. It was probably the best way he couldve come back tbh
I believe Albert is a really genuine person, please realize that he is apologetic, don't hate people's past.
This video just makes me realize how much of a failure I am, how much I can't fix myself no matter how much I try but watch others being able to rebuild and make themselves, I have no future or life I have never been able to live. life isn't a life till you live it so I haven't been living and will never live.
god this is the best redemption vid ever
If we can all forgive dr disrespect then why not forgive albert... or not .... I have my own issues to worry about
don’t worry albert we all forgive you
i'm so glad you came back, i know a lot of people saying bad things to you but i just want you to know i'm here
This makes me understand more of Albert and cleans a bit of marks he left behind :)
Cool cinematography
this really made me cry, I just started watching offline tv and found out about Albert but soon after found out about what happened and i hated him for cheating and after watching this I shed a tear seeing how much emotion this video had. Yeah Albert you fucked up but like you said what you do after will show if you changed and i’m just happy for you  and sorry for your lost ❤️
Actually really happy you’re back. I can’t imagine the kinds of cruel messages you have received from people.. We all know that everyone makes mistakes, most people can make them in private but the minute you’re in some kind of “public eye” people will hunt you down no matter what kind of mistakes you made.  I love these kinds of videos, the quality is amazing and your voice is so calm (podcast worthy✨)   I hope you can adopt a cute dog one day and I’m looking forward to see more of you!  Only by looking at this video I can tell you’ll make it big☺️💕   Stay safe and healthy!
Good luck to you.
This just shows how strong Albert is as a person, it's not easy receiving lots of hate and death threats and still comeback from it all to continue content creating. Happy to see you back Albert.
Im still mad at albert but tbh this video is well made
The editing is very cool
Man the hate will always come just keep looking forward. Lot's of love.
Nah, once a cheater always a cheater. yikes.
A goddamn GREAT apology video. This is how it fucking should be done, admitting you fucked up saying sorry, and making an effort to be better. As for whether the 2nd part is true only time will tell, but either way, good luck! I wish all the best for you.
Hey Albert,  Not sure whether you will read this or not. But know that your mistake was just one of the many that will happen and that is okay. I support your step to take a different pathway. Good work and keep on fighting. Take care albert.  From Nobody in particular.
Just got recommended this no idea who you are or what happened but this was a fantastic video and good luck! What ever you’re going through it won’t last forever!   Oh and I can also vouch for the working out to help with depression did wonders for me too!
Welcome back Albert
Name of the music in this video? The song choice is insane
I never though I’d watch a video like this I mean never watch this type of video completely  I watched this from start to finish
I dunno what happend but good thing that ur back :0
THE PRODUCTION VALUE IS INSANE
At 3:14 it kinda looks like toast when he’s grown up
gotta admit, that was one hell of a well made video
being blatantly aware of what he has done, knowing that he can never make it right, accepting the consequences, working toward becoming better.
Fine i give you one more chance
Welcome back. beautiful filming btw
She still loves him
This video is fucking amazing. Shooting, symbolism, editing its really beautiful.   I am really glad that you're not making your mistakes define you but instead what you can learn from it being a better person.   Beautiful video man.
Welcome back time never stop
i wish you good luck for this change you want to make
I cant tell if its an im back vid or a michael reeves reference sorta thing
Even if you have done something wrong that wrong doing is gonna disappear one day and I forgive Albert
I didn`t know what was the reason for this apology, but I can genually say,  It`s the best apology in the whole youtube ever, cuz it`s not just some whining that makes you vomit. It`s just self reflection and change of heart. Wish y luck.
You can do it man, you become wiser from the flames you passed, good luck.
Even if he made a mistake, it doesn’t mean he should a hated for what he has done.
We all hope you changed
lmao.
XD I took me 3 months to see this, but this actually doesn't just help u. I'm sure it helps other ppl in some way, too,  and I think this helps me! And yeast is a good friend in all terms, so I don't blame ya for friending from yeast.
Hey Albert, I don’t know if you’ll see this or not but I’m sorry. I’m sorry for judging you for a mistake you made that did not affect me whatsoever. I’m sorry for talking bad about you when I don’t even know you. I’m sorry for letting social media and drama cloud my judgement and see you as this villain when your just human. I wanted to tell you that this video has helped me so much understand my path in life and that I can change, I can make my life better if I live to forgive myself.
Good to see you again.
If you're here to talk shit to Albert, you're not welcome here
i always forgiven you and I always believing in you.
the video editing though— ★★★★★ hang in there!
Aprender del error es lo que importa, thanks for the vid tho
People make mistakes, he's obviously learned from his and people should stop hating on him for one mistake. Nobody's perfect and people deserve a second chance. This one mistake shouldn't be the end of his life. People have fked up way worse.
Phenomenal Video, I dont know Albert i only recently started watching otv when Micheal joined and heard about Albert cheating and what not. I didn't hate on him because well I wasn't there I dont know what happened but I was thinking I would not ever watch his content because of what happened and probably wouldn't like him. I decided to search his channel and see what happened to him out of curiosity and behold he just started uploading...now what he did before was wrong definitely but from what I've seen he seem very genuine and honestly I think I'll be watching more of his content. Also I saw his coming back stream and also felt he was very genuine in it, he didn't make himself seem like a victim or says that he's grown past it or whatever one thing that he said that made me believe him was when he said "im worried if in 5 years from now I'll think about this and say "yeah that wasn't so bad" " something like that  To summarize Good luck Albert in this bumpy journey you fucked up bad but I do hope you bounce back, you seem like a great guy ill be watching
"I started sleeping 8 hours a day" .... to me that seems like nothing ;o
Ah the two of wives, excellent choice🍷forsenCD
<3
Think before doing it
Wow this was powerful. I don’t think you could have handled this any better. You know you messed up but you also know that you take full responsibility and are working to improve. Good on you.
You can pull it off man.
Dont quit. And thanks I also fucked up. And this video showed me that this is not the end. Thank u. And keep going
I didn't knew you before and only really got presented to otv with the joining of michael and i admit that i kept many bad felling for you since when heard ur story... BUT I hear your comeback and agree with you. I'll be knowing more from today because i'm now a follower of you, and respect the person you are and its still to become. I admire ur thrive and support you on ur path, with i'll be watching closely as for now i really root for your sucess and hapiness  Welcome back Albert.
It's none of our business in the first place to hold grudges.  If y'all ever held a grudge, you shouldn't have.  And don't act like you welcome him back if you clearly held a grudge for him for leaving.  You say "welcome back" because you wanted him to return.  What happened between Lily and him isn't for us to judge, because that is his personal life.  While this video is mainly for himself it's hard to carry all that hurt in the first place, and trust me, I know what it feels like.  You feel like you'd rather end yourself than endure all the hate.  You feel alone.  I don't know if he really felt all that but it really doesn't matter because it's still wrong in the first place to make him feel like that.  He was never looking to be happy, he was looking for joy: where he could wake up in a bad situation in difficult times and feel good about it.  Happiness will always have an end.  Playing music for him gives him joy.  He didn't come to YouTube to do anything else.  We shouldn't involve ourselves in judging his past.  Go never judged me about my past so neither should anyone else
As soon as i saw yeastboi, all was forgiven
Road will bee long, but hey .. Welcome back.
I never thought that Joe Momma would actually tell someone to kts O_O
So proud of you, dude. You're on a righteous path and I wish you the best. Every day is a challenge and I'm excited to see how you handle those challenges. Much love, man, and never give up.
He had the guts to say sorry and admit what he have done. That part of it was already impressive..i can already tell that these people you have hurt already forgiven you and moved on from it. i wish everyone have forgiven you. and you have learned your lesson..im counting on you not to do it again
still hate this guy always remember actions speak louder than words ://
I'll be clear.   Beautiful. We all do mistakes and stuff, but what you did is amazing. I'm truly hoping that you'll find happiness. Keep going, you're amazing.
Apology Video.  Done Perfectly Right.
Yo, I never comment on videos or even get emotionally attached to "online personas" but just wanted to tell you that I got you. We are living a dark time right now and regardless of what any of us did in the past, I'm a big believer that no one should be "sentenced" for life for a mistake. You fucked up, you know you fucked up. What is important is that regardless of how fucked up our actions were in the past, today, we can be the light to someone else's life. I hope you can be that light now  because everyone, and I mean everyone will eventually turn the lights off and need some guidance. Hard work ahead of you but I hope you remain ON. Cheers
Bruh who else cried watching this
To all the people that are saying this is cringe, this video is an excuse, he doesn't deserve to come back, etc.  What was your idea then? Did you expect him to be cancelled for the rest of his life? Did you expect him to end his life? Be a human and think like a human. Albert is JUST like us, I reckon there are many of us in the comments who have done something as outrageous or even more than what Albert did.   Albert went into his own hole to reflect and learn from his mistakes. He didn't just disappear and do nothing the past year just waiting for a "cooldown" before he can start up again, he was really working hard on himself and call me naive but I believe him. I WANT to see a changed Albert and I believe he has changed. You can even see it in the way he speaks in the video, if you really watched.
Good luck!
Bro, fuck everything else, how did you get your hands on the "500" Fontaines
Nice video man
wait.. what did he do?
Ngl lie half you are jumping on the ban wagon.
I dont get why everyones calling this an apology video, he never even said sorry. This is meant to be an update on how hes becoming a better person, which we all wanted to hear. Tbh Albert's change is actually unbelievable, it's actually very rare to see this happen. He also shouldnt have to apologise to us, we decided to get involved in his personal life. Hes apologised to the people who hes hurt and that's enough. We should really be the ones apologising for making this situation ten times worse than it should have been for Ablert, Lily, and pretty much the whole of OTV.
Dude's a freaking talented film maker I'll give him that! The video writing and shots were amazingly well done. Love the bit about following your passions, though I wish it ended with a bit more complete foil to that notion.
Anyone can change mostly guys like you
It's not an apology video... He's just recapping what he has been doing. He literally said that the video is about himself.
The quality of this video is crazy good. Putting the past aside, it's clear he's been working his ass off to better himself and his videos.
I legit hate cancel culture, people act like they’re so nice but as soon as somebody makes a mistake they are prepared to ruin their life just for entertainment. I don’t know what you think but that’s not very nice to me
Am I the only one that thinks this video alone is better than half of the movies I have seen?
I wish you an extremely good life Albert.
You can tell he spent effort on this video and to be a better person.
Do mistake but don't  create habit. Again don't create regrets it will burnt u forever like a Lava🌋.
Can I just say this cinematography is pretty damn good?
This is the most edited sorry video I've ever seen
gl
It's a powerful video: from the stunning cinematography to the message of self improvement. Celebrities who are viewed to have everything tend to venture down dark paths. We view this success as a way out of a miserable life; but as we've been learning throughout covid: if you're not happy with yourself, nothing will cure that except self improvement. I've looked up to you for your creative mindset, and i'm glad to see what more you have to give in the future.
Welcome back albert XD
Hope ur in a good place  good luck mate
will the other cheater address her part as a snake too?
I'm glad that your feeling better now. I wish you the best in life, may the universe be grateful to you.
damn, he knows his skincare (drunkelephant)
This inspired so many, welp im glad Albert put aside his fear and overcame the internet's thoughts. He created a new start as viewers were proud. gg wp
my question is where was his income this past year
yikes
*this is honestly no joke the best apology video ever uploaded on youtube. NO the internet*
I'm just speechless, this kind of videos makes me think so much of my current life decisions and how can someone actually stand back up after hitting bottom. I really like this and I feel a spark of truth to this. Time may actually heal some of the worst situations out there. If you read this Albert, hope you do amazing in everything you want to achieve for your own good.
3:34 the rubik's cube at the back is actually a very expensive gan cube.
ngl, i almost cried when he talked about his grandma.  Albert we forgive you, welcome back <3
I can relate to this way too muche
I’m glad you are doing alright Albert. The way you made this shows you are taking this seriously and want to do better. You want to forget the old Albert and transform into a better one. I can say I forgive you but I’m not the one you cheated on. I’m glad you and lily are in good terms. I wish you good luck not only in your career but also in life. People can call me a simp but I frankly don’t care. I’m not like everyone in this shit platform being toxic. I say live on and have a good life. In this world everyone will make mistakes and wish for forgiveness. Thank you for being better and owning up to your mistakes.    ~~~Have a wonderful life Albert. May you continue to grow~~~
Just so you know you didn't deserve her, Michael loves and appreciates lily more in 1 stream than you did in your whole relationship ...
I actually was mad when I first saw the video in my recommendations... But I still watched it and I've come over to the conclusion that, yes we were mad, yes we had all the reasons to, but life goes on, so do we.  What about we move on?
I was just sitting here, watching the Asmongold reacting to this and while watching it I got a: This is the next step/This is my diary vibe. This is really relatable for me bcs I did something terrible in a girls life ... And really understand the extinguished fire .. so I find this movie inspiring and motivating. I love that you pulled through and found a way. Please do stuff you love to do, makes you satisfied and we will love watching you.
Good on you pal
I’ve subbed
Anyone noticed the lily at 0:52?
This is definitely the best apology video that I have ever seen
All the sad stuff aside (not in a fucked up way), this was a very cool video. Sup Albert.
Welcome back Albert, you don't know me, and you probably never will know me other than a viewer but I am proud of you for working on yourself and welcome back.
4:53 *Yoshikage Kira would like to know your location*  PS I respect the video and its purpose but this is just too good to pass up.
It's so hard to believe Albert did this. I wouldn't even think this was possible. He got so much hate, so many death threats, and he somehow fought against it. I can't leave with any "well done Albert". Albert, you did the impossible. Please just know that even with all the people who spread havoc, the people that start drama, the people who want to dead for something you did, and the people who won't stop hating, we will keep supporting you. It's stupid really, how so many people invaded your privacy, only to keep the checkmark by your channel name invisible. People shouldn't have even questioned what happened back there. In the future, I can imagine apologies from every comment section to you. This message could help lots of people.  Thank you for this, Albert.
Holy how long did this Video took to make?
yo drop music and make shit like this holy shit this is g000d
this is an amazing film
Very heartfelt, anyone deserves a second chance. Yes, he made a mistake but... Bad things are guaranteed to happen in life.
great video, as always. was about time you came back. hope you are well. peace
Welcome back
8:52 I'm like 90% sure that's Kyle Landry there. He's a crazy good classically trained Youtube pianist.
omwgalul
We make horrible mistakes. I know I have. All you can do is learn from it and move on.
0:48 i love how he used objects and videos of his own to express the things he lost that where the most important to him
LOL, HOW DID HE GO FROM DOG TO YEAST?!
I hope your grandma learns what you did while she's in hell
This was amazing, Albert.
Why he's gone what have he done
its been a while since ive seen him , he was a genuinely good person and a great content creator, yes he fucked up, big time,but the man has suffered  a lot and got through it,  and even lily has forgiven him and he wants to become a man worthy enough to forgive himself. Thats all its to it, and I respect that.  Welcome back Albert , hope we would see you for a long time.
apology and drama aside, this video is so visually pleasing and well written. I'm sure it took a heck ton of effort. also who is cutting onions here?
I'm just happy that the top comments are just showing support, bravo guys we're growing bit by bit to becoming better people
Welcome back
ElonMusk21
what you did is for people you hurt and yourself to either forgive or not. It just pains me that all these random ass people get so negative about it when its not even their problem.
good video
skeet skeet
I wish I had the financial capacity to sleep 8 hrs a day and play video games and eat so much food for a year whew
Ngl the bread looked good
I’ve never seen anyone make their own stock footage before
Chief go make a movie!
this was a really good vid man im glad your looking for ways to better yourslef and live for your own person. I think your setting a really good example for people who may be a little lost right now.  Seriously I hope you succeed with all your striving towards and continue to make your life and the lives of those around you better. Im sure your grandmother would be proud. <3
I'm a big fan of Michael, Lily, and OTV. But, ngl, I relate a lot to this.
I dont know Albert at all but this video is so high quality I subscribed
Really appreciate the effort Albert. Effort in regaining control, learning from mistakes, and effort in improving to be a better person. You’ve earned your second chance, so really value your connections this time.   I can feel your passion in this video, and you couldn’t have said it any better. Thank you for the message because honestly, a lot of people who have F’d up in life also need to hear about this side of reality and learn from it. Often it’s hard to forgive or listen at all, but you’ve shown us your sincerity in all of this.   Keep growing and striving for the better.   Welcome back Albert.
You know i really dont give a shit of what he did. Ofc its his mistake but hes a content creator that i like and that makes my day better so ye good job Albert happy to see you back
I'm really glad you're back :)
2:33 did you really get high (point 19), amazing video, happy to see you come back
I only have three words... Good shit Albert, Good shit. glad you could recover
fucking amazing video...
i just subscribed, i don't know what exactly happened but THIS is sincere:) em just a random person don't mind me this is just my opinion, u have yours and i respect that
Idk you Albert. Never watched any of your stuff. Heard about what you did. From experience, these tough times become a trial and its wholesome to see that another individual is finding that sign of life back again.
Bet you if the roles were reversed you wouldnt persecute the other for what they did. They are adults and know about forgiveness, and hes been forgiven.  Now the rest of yall assholes should hop of the albert hate hype train
I really like the songs in the background. Does anyone know the names? Also, great video :)
Come on guys, we dont need to hate on albert anymore... we need to let go of the past and start of a brand new future, we need to give him a chance. We need to forgive him, lily already forgived him and its time we forgive him.
yeah its ok to mess up sometimes and thats not an excuse to mess up but its about learning from the mistakes you make so that you better yourself and dont make them again , in the end we are all gonna die so being scared of messing up is just a bad mindset
Damn,this video is so fucking high quality,I was just thinking about it the entire time.
The only apology I ever watched until the end. It was visually entertaining and thats what kept me going while it still delivered a strong message. Keep going Albert, wish u the best
keep doing what you do albert, i respect you and i relate to you. all the best
Welcome back Albert we will support whatever you choose to do with your content
I'm glad your back Albert. I'm glad you took the time to reflect over your actions. Please don't repeat mistakes after you learned why you caused them. It's like playing an instrument, and I know full well that you know that. I just hope you can move on in life.
hey, that's pretty good) good video, man. pretty inspiring video. take care of yourself and have a great day)
Welp.... Now, it's time for Fed to make his come back in this EXACT SAME WAY. Lol
This video was gorgeously made.
my mans got shit erg form    p.s. glad to see you back
I really love your content and I don't really care about what people are saying about you being a bad person or anything I just want you to keep making your content and do what you do best
You socializing yourself is my everyday life and that's when I kinda felt bad bc I don't enjoy it aswell but the only difference is that I've never been into relationship but I can relate to everything else you said
Thanks for the inspiration
Welcome back!
I forgive you for the bad things you did and i hope this will be a new beginning
We aren't in the position to forgive, but lily and I think she already forgave him (she's also very happy with Michael and I love that) We shouldn't do unnecessary things, sending threats, rude messages, hateful comments.. Tho he really fckd up and I just hope he changes
This is surprisingly top tier apology video.
Welcome back albert 🌟
Albert welcome back! It's ok please be happy I know it's hard but you can do it you have to keep a good mindset and stay healthy physically and mentally you matter to us your a content creator no less you are also a cool genuine person so take care and have a good day you value the same as other people.Welcome back!
I just thought I should write this as a more broader perspective about Albert's return to streaming and YouTube.  So the guy did cheat, which is a terrible thing to do to anyone, and I do not think it is something to be taken lightly. But, he acknowledged his mistake and took time to reflect on the situation and did a good job tackling it from many avenues.   It is not simply doing things, the man is literally changing his lifestyle to one which many lack. A lifestyle which involves your loved ones. But most importantly, a lifestyle which teaches you to love yourself. Albert is doing what many streamers lack, which is spending time alone with your thoughts and understand them. That is something no regular person can do. He built up his awareness about himself and it is something which he should be proud of doing.   Think about Tiger Woods. The best golfer in the world at his prime. An unstoppable machine in the game, but he too fell into the trap. He too was also not in the right head space, and it showed in his performance that he was not in a good place. Though he had other major injury set backs, he did let the past plague his love for the game. Rather, It fueled him to perform. He out performed JT, DJ, J Day, Rory and many others. 2018 Tour Champion and 2019 Masters champion at 46 years old!  This video serves and his return not for us, not for his fans, and especially not for the fame. It is for him and that is something only the strong willed people can do. Others can hide and talk behind their backs or behind their screen. But, reality is, this man is back, and he is stronger than any of the top streamers combined.  So Albert, when I google your name, I can guarantee you that it will say "The streamer who didn't let his past ruin his life."  Let your fire burn within you and let your success flourish.    And to the haters, exit the chat, there is no need for you to be here.
I hope this doesn’t come off the wrong way, but I really felt this apology video. I screwed up back in middle school and I’ve been living with those mistakes for a long time. Seeing you come back ready to work and stream really gives me motivation that I can do something similar. Thank you for just being here and deciding to be brave enough to come back!
This video is probably the most worked-on one I've ever seen on YouTube in my whole life, it somehow makes me really proud of you that you put so much effort in doing this video, and I hope you that you will come back safely and unharmed
bruh what you did back then was super fucked up but people do change. Good luck to you andIi hope you really find something you don't fuck up in. Cheers mate, to self improvement and learning from old mistakes
wb, al.
I legit don't know who you are, but I got you on my recommended
at first when the whole "Albert did somthing bad to lily" thing i was kind of a hater not really a big one but after some time i just started understanding him a lot i also saw how truly sorry he is and how weak he became after that  and now i truly understand and i don't think albert should get this much hate for a video he did for himself i no longer feel that i as a viewer have any right to feel mad cuz the important thing is LILY FORGAVE HIM!!! WHY SHOULD WE AS VIEWERS STILL BE MAD??????  the thing is he is not our sweet little bitch that we can be mad at for something that  he did to someone that we basically don't know at least most of us cuz yeah lily is pretty famous but i don't think that just cuz she is famous all her fans should feel something for her that she already passed from so what i'm saying is that all this hate is really stupid and i really am happy for albert that he is getting up and strong again  so GOOD LUCK ALBERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you have all of mu support!! <3
"when u do what you love, your life becomes your work"
this is the most edited apology ive seen lol
I dont follow you much but i enjoy your clips. When the news came out I was more of a shock but didn't really pay much attention to it cause these thing happen everyday and its not my place to judge. Sometimes I wonder too, that mistakes we done define us? Idk, but if we overcome it and be better, that is an accomplishment in my book. Welcome back Albert and looking forward to seeing more of your content.
Why do i feel like it's a movie
Respect
17 seconds in, is this a Deadpool trailer?
This is a high quality video. I still don't like him for cheating but now he has a 2nd chance and I hope that he won't waste it. Sure there are still some people waiting for him to trip agian but I hope that he continues to be good and keep walking forward to be a better person.
Man Albert Messed Up But We Need to forgive him
Hey Albert, not sure if you'll read this but I really love your music and I want to say I can't wait to see and listen to more of it. Your music has been sorely missed from my subscriptions feed
I tried my best not to laugh, but the "play by play" got me. soz
Work of art
Don’t get me wrong I hate cheaters, but this man lost his family his friends his job/career he lost his absolutely everything because of a mistake. It’s kinda messed up lol.
welcome back!
I'm a nobody but I genuinely hated you for a while after what you've done to Lily, but I'm really happy to see this as opposed to a half assed apology video. You were always so creative and talented and the 10 year of league music was one of the most amazing things I've watched on YouTube. I genuinely hope you achieve your goals and you forgive yourself.
NAH
I wih you luck and happiness in your pursuits as one flawed human being to another. May we all learn from our errors and lapses of judgment as you aim to do.
My only problem is the people say stupid stuff and act like they know what tf they are talking about. But in reality a lot of people have done fucked up shit. I can confidently say that at least one of the thousand dislikes and at least one of the  people who didn't forgive albert majority of you have probably done something messed up weather you know it or not. Its also crazy how you talk about albert as if you know him personally. Like if some one walked up to you and told you that oh this random person that you don't know cheated on this other person that you don't know. You would probably say something along the lines of that person is bad or a piece of garbage. But in reality you probably don't even give a shit about that person I doubt you will go out of your way to trash on some rando that you don't know, cause its a waste of your time. But yet you sit here not forgiving albert even though its not your apology to forgive or reject. Its Lily's, and she already forgave him so Why still trash on him. All though what I think he did is messed up and everyone has there own opinions. I don't think that you can just go and fuck up someone else life unless that, that person has done something personal to you, and at that point its no ones business but yours and the other persons. I say this cause telling someone for example to kill them selves is going to far especially if that person didn't even do anything to you or anything that effected your personal life.
0:52 ummmmm, yeah.
You have my respect good sir.
Welcome back Albert!! :) Looking forward to what's to come.

Hey, Albert, I think this is great! I really liked hearing your story (especially with this caliber of craftsmanship). I never knew your channel if not because of Lily, or Michael, or William Osman (Geez why did Youtube brought me down here). Naively, I appreciate any wisdom from a strong person that you seem to have become. Cheers!
You got this, good luck Albert.
I just recently discovered you and went into the rabbit hole of well... Past stuff. I cannot judge your past because we’re in this current chapter of life. The story has yet to end, but I will say one bad chapter doesn’t mean one bad story. I like to see where your story goes if you continue it.   May Your Heart Be Your Guiding Key~
out of context, this video play is epic
holy fuck how did I cry
This was really well made
man this made me cry and ion even know who this guy is i was watching/listening Vocaloid and this came up-
so proud of lily and albert!!!!
Albert, you probably won't be reading this but a Dr.K stream would be good content if your like the idea, also this was incredibly introspective and I loved every second of it
I enjoyed this video so much it opened my eyes and made me realize that we are truly not perfect. Even the fact that this video is so well put is amazing I love this video, I truly do. Thank you for making this video and help me understand the situation of mistakes, wrong decisions, etc. Thank you so much for this video I loved every single second of it<3333
Yes Albert messed up, but I’m still willing to give him another chance. If we were all judged by our worst past mistake then life would be pretty awful.
The amount of quality in this video parallels the deep reflection and thought you put into yourself. I hope you become happier and truly live an honest life. Thank you for being transparent with us.
:D
Redemption Arc about to be unique always gotta learn to love yourself keep moving forward bro
👏
Anyone notice the street he was running on? Liberty Street
One fact is clear, Albert is better without OTV, no distractions no bullshit. More time and energy to focus on himself and making high quality content that he likes.
Now, we just have to wait for Fed.
This is top notch videography
This was really well done. Welcome back.
I don't get what some people want from this guy. Most of the time all you get is some shitty "I will change" and fake tears but this guy is literally showing you how he has and is changing. idc he should be forgiven imo
Somethings i noticed   0:53 lilies 0:58 read the script 1:02 mug with lilies 1:36 pillow with lilies (i think) 1:43 statue of "liberty"  2:37 lily painting 7:12 "liberty" hill      Add if you have noticed some
Hey man just want to say you seem to be doing well, and i hope things go good for you!
We are Human.
Albert thank u, you help me in some way, you don't notice. You give me encouragement 🙂😆 🤗.                          Albert welcome back, we miss  you 🤗💕(◍•ᴗ•◍) ｡◕‿◕｡     (*￣(ｴ)￣*)

Lily is more happy now. Its faith.
Wow  .Albter u will probably never see it but this video made me kind of sad but It gave me some motiviaton to work on myself now.
That scenery right at the end looks straight out of a movie!!! 😲
HAPPY YOUR BACK
ive just recently found out about the whole drama that has been going on about albert and yes he has done some fucked up stuff that some of you may not be able to forgive him for, but despite all the mistakes he's done he used it instead to better himself, which i can clearly see. this man is genuine and i hope things get better for him in the future 👍🏻
Ok yes he fucked up, never have been a fan of him. Kinda hated him for a while but holding grudges on things that I’m not educated on sucks. I let it go, i move on. And so should you. This is one of the better apologies i have seen, not denying it but instead he took it and used it to better himself and you have to respect that.
Quality is dope!
this is my first time watching ur vids the transition... continuity.. soooo satisfying
DAMN THIS OPENING HIT DIFFERENT THO FR
You know what?Apology accepted.This is the most sincere video i've seen in a long time!Feel better and DO better from now on Albert.Take care<3
Beautiful work Albert.
Damn this shit dank
I just want to say great video love your return and you don’t know old friends may forgive you...you just have to wait nice return👍
Cheater.
I don't know if it is my position to point this out. But at 7:39, the sign of the street name... Albert has definitely put effort into this video and I highly respect that. Hope to see you posting more vids soon :)
lol 6.9k dislikes
Boys, I think it’s time. Let him out of Brazil.
Yo this video really well made though
Look It's NEVER ok to cheat. Albert took time to change himself. Unlike other people who have made mistakes in the past and apologized for it without even embracing their mistake, Albert did not ignore or sugar coat what he did. He knew it was wrong. As he quote: "Mistakes aren't what ultimately define you, it's what you do after." I've watched his 3 current streams before commenting this and I must say, that he's doing his best.
I just discovered this video cause the algorithm buried it  it's an amazing video, to begin with, and seeing him move on brings many people the joy I think he's the one who suffered the most from the tragedy I can't give him sympathy over what he did during that event but I hope his goals will come true.  also, it is pretty well said if you understood what it is then its an amazing video well, I wish that big tragedy was the last since I want to listen to more of his content.
I hope fed could also come back with this self-reflection/sincerity, his reputation may be totally destroyed, but he could still pull this back up.
Hey dude I think that was really nice. I hope your doing well. That made me tear up a little. I hope you get back into creating things. I would love to watch your videos.
0:53 omg he meant lily 🥺
Guys even though albert messed up big big time he’s human someone who says to end their life well that’s unforgivable it’s ok to hate him for what he’s done but he’s trying to rebuild himself at least it’s not like he did a crime that sended him to prison *note I did not go to prison* we only have one life so let’s make it count let’s go on to a deep sleep with happiness not depression maybe u will come to understand his situation *note did not cheat on a person before in my life*
Damn when i saw the memes on this i thought he made a shitty video but it's pretty decent good on him
I don't know if you will, but I really hope you see this Albert. I truly respect you for this. I don't condemn you for being a cancelled content creator at all. We are all human who will always make mistakes. In fact, we share very similar goals and I see a reflection of myself in you. I'm going through a journey myself, battling depression and it is very clear for me that you have grown a lot. I want to remind you that what you have achieved in terms of is self development is no easy feat. I wish you the best of luck on your journey and that one day you will be able to forgive yourself.
I never cared for you or your content before, but this is an amazing video. Everyone fucks up, and I have a lot of respect for you for being strong and motivated enough to come back and move forward.
I'm so happy for you! Good job! ❤️
Everyone is going around talking about forgiveness, for me that was settled up when Lily forgave him. Can we just admire for a second the cinematic quality of this video? Pretty fucking dope for something coming from a streamer.
This inspired me to be a better person. Thanks for creating such a genuine, relatable video. Wish you the best of luck in this crazy ride called life.
4:03 @sleightlymusical i know a rama when i see one 😍
This video is oddly satisfying lol but I hope you the best and for your happiness to come. Glad you're doing a little better. Even though you've done some things that are hurtful I know you could still change.
Really mixed feelings about this, but I’m glad Albert’s prioritizing his mental health now
this is beautiful can’t wait to see the new man you have become
The problem was never truly him. It was because of the online community.  Ppl think that just cus they are on the internet means that they can trashtalk and destroy others because of sth that they did. Its not your problem so dont worsen it
This is the best “apology” video that any youtuber has ever done before, keep up the good work!
Albert, you’re such a beautiful and good person. I love you so so much.
Idk why people are still hating him so much like he killed someone while Katerino litteraly cheated on 70 guys and is already forgiven
Vl đầu cắt moi 😕
Good luck.  I think a lot of people may take things from this video and learn how to gain happiness in their own lives.  Society could use more stories about personal development instead of cancel culture these days.
Ur gucci in my eyes
Yeah, my man! I like the progress you said you've been having, and I wish ya all the luck while walking down this path, believe me, every single one of us are walking down a path to self evolution and progress that can only fit ourselves and no one else. And all of us have our own challenges, and we fall and get back to fight one more day, and everybody should be given the chance to take another crack, a chance to do it again, and hopefully better. And don't pay a lot of attention to bad comments on the internet that have "inflicting you pain"  as it's very purpose, no one here is at a place where they can judge you. We are all here to learn. But for the time being, you wanna show us stuff, and we are all here to watch you shine, booooi!! I'm glad you're back!! 😆
the internet is a harsh place. one little mistake and people will remember you forever. they never focus on the good, its always the bad that tends to burrow in people's minds.   but this was a better apology video than half of the streamers who merely sit in front of their camera and say a simple 'im sorry'. mad respect for that.  i hope you can come back stronger, and i hope that you wont make these mistakes anymore.
Man someone get this guy a mind set of pure joy and love. No lie ppl can fuck up now and then yall who dislike this vid, yall acting like yall don't fuck up what so ever. Welcome back and I hope u have a heart felt welcome
This is a beautiful film, but Omfgg he looks so much like Amber Liu. I finally realized who he looked like.
almost cried
You are not a piece of shit. You're human, and human make mistakes.
Hey! If you're a viewer in this comment section, your opinion probably doesn't really matter in this situation. This isn't your apology to accept or reject.
I did not expect to feel any sympathy with this video. I was wrong. Good luck, Albert. I wish you the best.
Damn that roasted duck and red hongbai gave me feels.
Wow did I just watch a movie or something... that's some next level video production quality, hope to see more great content from you and good luck on your career. I'm just generally impressed...
As long as he knew he made a mistake it's alright. Everyone makes mistakes! Albert welcome back!
i say vent u say ✨⭐️🌟vent🌟⭐️✨
I like how he only said sorry to us but not lily throughout this apology video
He should become a film producer, this is super cool, and very inspirational, this is a good piece of film and I feel very proud of him. I really hope he’s having a good life, and feeling happy. Stay true to yourself and keep yourself mentally strong! If you ever need to talk, I’m open!
Welcome Back, Albert!
The past is the past. You can’t change that no matter how hard you try. However, you can change what happens in the future. Glad to see you’re truly happy with what yo doing now. Welcome back.
Idk why he making a cinematic tho
I'm sorry. I'm new here. Can someone tell me what happened?
I forgive you if that means anything XD
respect+
You are your own happiness and I wish you the best to become whoever you want to become ✨
By doing what he did in the past, he left a really big scar on his reputation and burned many bridges which will probably never be rebuilt. In my opinion that's enough. I understand that he hurt Lily a lot and both his and her friends, not even mentioning his fans, but we have to remember, that punishment he got, was really big. And the remnants of last mistakes, the scars left by this same punishment, will never go away. And in this video, he presented that he understands all of this and is taking steps to better himself, even tho many would give up after that, or not change anything. So I think he deserves a second chance. Or at least that's my opinion.
There’s definitely still people that can’t forgive him and he definitely doesn’t know what the future holds for him but whatever it is I can’t wait to see what the future holds for Albert
Damn only 500k views, Doc got like 900k viewers when he came back. Step it up champion.
I envy the change you have gone through and continue to make to your life. Respect
This video inspired me, and so i thank you..
I've only been a fan of yours for two years and i love your videos and think you're pretty cool, so i hope you're able to be happy and make more stuff for us that still watch you
It's freaking YEAST BOI
so talented <3
Rower here: lmao his erg form baaaad
This is honestly the best video I have watched in a long time its so dang well made wtf
At least he actually admits his mistakes, a respectable decision
Beautifully made, huge respect.
I wanna make high quality stuff like this
7:14  Liberty hill  YIKEZ
Honestly this was made really well
I hope everything get better its all the pass lily happy and I hope thing go better I loved your music so hope you learn what happen and not do it again and probably do what you want to do but big talk this reminding me of Tokyo ghoul the mc
Ok im gonna say this and hope this get pin so all of you f-er that don't read the description know what's this video is about.  Albert apology is and has already been said on twitter check that shit out. This video is made main to sump up for the whole times of why he was gone, and what he was doing for the past years to clear up the question for the people may ask in the future. And also he going to do his best to improv himself. That's it !  (NOT AN APOLOGY VIDEO, IT BEEN A YEARS, OR 2 IDK, LILY ON GOOD TERM WITH HIM. MOVE ON !!!!)
Hope things get better.
Lily has forgiven Albert but i think we should too.
I cried
Rip Yeast Boy...
Hi ! I'll like to translate this in french, cause even if it about a comeback i feel like a lot of thing said in this video could be apply to anything else and it might be an idea to make it accesible to people !
This is such a great video. Honestly, good luck! I'm going to keep watching.
So much love to you Albert, stay strong, for yourself, you deserve it. It doesnt matter what you have done, you should never have to feel the pain and loneliness you felt, and people with depression suffer from most days xx
Didn't know who the hell were you before all of this, but I'm glad you're back man
welcome back i miss your streams
love this vid awesome man
It takes a man to agree with other mans problems
The fact that this man learned to redefine himself in one year is astounding.  Personally, I think that Albert is a man of many talents is a one in a billion that is capable of anything, this including fixing his own mistakes.  I love the progression he’s made, something I don’t even know if I’d be capable of doing if I were in his shoes.  I’ve always respected Albert since I knew that he was always a good person at heart, but now, I’m so glad that I get to see an even better version of him.
This video has better composition than some Hollywood movies
People these days are so irritating. I had a best friend that got cheated on and you know what she said to me? She said don't hate on her ex she moved on so I should too. If Lily already did you should too.
I hope the best for you :)
This guy... Has to go back to OTV
Not here to defend or to hate, just giving my opinion:  I can understand to a certain extent to why people are so mad as to why you are making this video instead of an apology,  I get they aren't satisfied but overall it's not going to effect them as a person. I think you completely justify why you made this instead of an explanation and apology video. I get that people fuck up and they change. I think everyone deserves a second chance if they're showing that they're changing, which you are. The people who this actually affected knows why you left so there is nothing to explain. Yes, you did fuck up and since most of what happened was made public I do see the reason as to why you should put up an apology video, but it's not the public who's life stood still or who's life was canceled. It was yours and the others directly affected by it. I do think you shouldn't have made this grade a video with a small apology in it. I think you should've made a video and directly sent it to the people you hurt and caused problems with cause at the end of the day it's you and them who were affected. I don't think people should be sending so much hate considering you are trying to better yourself. I get what you did was really stupid and fucked a lot of things up, but life is fucked up so people should get over it. I think you did an alright job with this video and coming back. I don't throw any hate towards the fact of you showing yourself again. I do think that you did a bad job at expressing to the one's in the problem how sorry you are though. Overall I'm kind of on both sides. I think there should've been something apologizing for the mistakes made, but on the other side I don't think it should be public to those who just want to be in other's problems. I get what you used to do was letting the viewers into your personal life but some things don't need to be made public. If a parent is financially struggling, I'm sure the parent wouldn't want the child to go around telling everyone at school or in the neighborhood. Or if someone pees the bed, I'm sure they wouldn't want their parents or siblings going around telling friends and family. I really think people just need to let some things go. Again, I understand why people are upset but the only one's who should be able to forgive you or not are the main people in the problem. People fuck up. That's it. Very little people win at the game of life. All the people who are sending hate, I'm sure you'll find something that you've fucked up at and that will always be there. But you either run from it or learn from it. Simple. He's learning and rebuilding from it. Wounds heal but scars may last a life time. He may have fucked up this once and the people hurt might not may never forget, but he's a person too. I don't think people should keep you from finding peace with yourself and showing your face again. I think you've learned from it and you wont make the mistake again. I'm not going to support you in the future for what you may do or how you may grow. I will come back and watch future content but I'm also not going to throw hate and put you down for getting over past mistakes and growing as a person.  ***My opinion***  Not here to start drama in the comments or get people to agree and add on. This is simply just my view of things and I felt like sharing.
Its okay, albert. Everyone fucks up, ya know. Atleast you can change for the better. Dont pressure yourself too much, dont overthink too much. You have great talent, just keep doing what you love :) ignore the hate. I wish you the best.
Yeah. I agree. Mistakes were made, time to work on one's self and learn and grow.
holy shit, i thought i would get a shitty apology video but this guy gave us a well edited masterpiece.
Make a full on movie or series, do some Mr. Robot type shit my dude, this is fucking cool. Regardless of the reason for this video being made, it's cool none the less.
This feels genuine.  Everybody fucks up and as Albert rightfully said "Who you are depends on what you do after you've fucked up". I for one am very curious to see what the Albert Chang of the future is going to be like. I wish you good fortune in your striving to become better.              Also: the Video editing was fcking fire
I still hate Albert for what he had done, because he cheated on Lily. But Lily found a much better person now and Albert has been heavily reflecting. At least he genuinely knew what he did was wrong and not give some half-ass apology.      Nice film though
Meaning behind this video....        Epic, I'm excited for this comeback!!
There’s no reason to not give this man another chance.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Basically Albert Chang to Albert Change
Nice video. Actions speak louder than words. I'll sub and expect some awesome content. Have fun so I can too.
"I failed to balance them all"
WELCOME BACK !
Before you dislike, watch the whole video with a mindset of Albert, not his friend's
You've reached good conclusions, hopefully to follow them. Good luck walking forward, I believe in your dream. Let's see if you do too.
Thank you for making this video. It really brought some insight for me about my own life. I hope you grow as much as you can from this and do great things Albert. and if you ever wanna talk you're more than welcome to send me a message.
I mean... it is an amazing video. Like wow, talk about effort.
10:01 God that ending is something I needed to hear...something I never could put into words never knew about you till now after I began watching lily a few days ago made me tear up
How can we trust you ever again?  You BETRAYED YOUR OWN FRIENDS AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND like tf???? I can NEVER trust you ever again. I am not going to spread hate or anything but this is the last video I'll ever watch from you .You can do your thing but I just can't- The audacity tho....damn. And the fact that cheaters are only sorry after they get caught is just... Wish you a good luck in life. This is a goodbye from someone who used to watch your covers and videos in the past.
The cinematography tho
He is inspired and trying to be a better person, he is very regretful about what happened.
yeast.
Wishing the best for you, Albert
I'm surprised people care so much over the internet. Relationship problems happen literally everyday. But just because he's an internet face, it means random people online can judge their lives.
i wish you happiness albert.
I feel as if people forget that these 'content creators' are also human and that we humans always make mistakes some maybe not as easily forgivable but overtime are forgotten. And not only that we thrive off them, as we don't let these mistakes define who we are. We choose not to give up but to grow and blossom into something new.    So to the people who hate Albert, please learn to not judge him off his past but what his future holds.
Honestly, who has never made mistakes in their life before? We are all human. Let this guy grow and move on instead of dwelling on his past.
You earned a new sub and my respect:)
wait i want a yeast boy too
PICK A CARD forsenCD ✨ THE TWO OF WIVES? forsenCD ✨ EXCELLENT CHOICE forsenCD ✨
Welcome back Albert. I'm glad you're okay. I'm really glad you're back.
what a way to come back. + respect
As much hate as I’ve seen Albert get. I really truly hope he’s happy man. He fucked up, but he owns his mistake and is being honest with himself and others. Albert man, I wish you the best. I’ll see you on twitch when I’m famous 👍
damn everyone has to admit that this was some fire camera work and pretty solid script writing
so well made....good luck ahead in life
Ok, i personally believe in 2nd chances. I also did fucked up in my life, not as bad as you, but it did costs me a fortune personally. I received a 2nd chance, and im currently moving forward. It's good that you are starting to change. As a former fan, i can't go back to be your fan, but maybe i can be a fan to the new you. I only wish you good luck Albert Chang, peace.
Thanks for posting this dude, this is super inspiring and humbling
I hate what you did to Lily, and it's inexcusable, but the best thing you can do from now is being transparent with your viewers and also with yourself, most importantly. Good luck.
Welcome back
He's past made him a better man now I understand what is to be gone because of a bad thing don't cancel people, show them what they did wrong.
That was powerful... literally all I can say–
Good Job :)
Welcome back man
I'm just hoping where one day, Albert and OTV can just come together, forget the past. Reunite as one. That would be cool. Hoping Fed will be coming back soon as a news man like Albert
Cinematography is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now, waiting for feds video.
I liked this video and I support you.
does anyone know what camera equipment he uses? ✨
I dont know who the fuck this is but I wish him the best
This editing is amazing man
6:40 yvonne XD
I think sleeping 8 hours a day is probably a good thing?
This was fantastic!
hey dude! i want to say that life is life. And its hard. I tried to suicide but there much more to live for. So go do you thing but not in a bad way, just believe in yourself. i have suffer a lot but it not worth it. just find something you comfortable with. come back as a twitch streamer, youtuber content creator. i dont mind. just want to let you know i will support you.
Loved the video
Being mad at someone you dont know for something they did to someone you dont know which that same person has already forgiven him for? WeirdChamp
Sorry long rant coming.    Honestly when the whole drama happened, I was angry. I was so goddamn angry about what he had done to my favourite content creator. Of course I never sent a comment to him or publicised any dislike towards him because I knew that he was going through utter hell with so many other people - braver people - shitting on him.   So when Albert came out with this video and his Twitch Livestream, I honestly was skeptical and yet at the same time, glad that he came back. I used to watch his music streams since they were so enjoyable, so when I watched his livestream, I was shocked by his remorse. As I grew up I had always learnt that cheaters were horrible people, selfish people even. And although this is true, there is a point where they learn about their wrong doings and Albert had to go through this process over hundreds upon millions of people telling this to him.   And I know most people reading the comments are tired of looking at these types of comments, but I want the best for Albert because he came out as a 'new' person. Not 'new' as in ENTIRELY new, but new as in some of his morals are new. He knows he fucked up and he acknowledges it. He takes time to pick himself up and after going through this rough ass time and truthfully, Albert has gained a supporter. I know he probably won't look at this but know that you have gained the acknowledgment and support of many people in the community. Don't ever forget that you're not alone. There are people beside you, supporting you.
I hate you as a person and wont support you but i think you should have a platform for the people that could actually forgive you despite the tremendous amount of pain youve caused, i just hope you learned from your mistakes and wont do anything even slightly close to your past mistakes
Happy you're back, Albie. We really appreciate you making this video. Yes you've done some stuff that some people hate you for, but we forgive you. Thank you for mustering up the courage to make this video. You were, and still are my favourite violinist, artist, magician and most of all you helped me to do what I love. So thank you, Albert, for being an amazing and inspiring person and creator.💕
We can forgive but cant forget
I don’t know why people are still being press about a situation he committed from the past and get so much backlash from it until this day. That was literally last year and lily already forgave him but albert himself haven’t. This is none of our business. People needs to stop acting like they are involved in the situation like albert cheated on them. Seriously, they need to stop crying like a baby.  And for those who are saying that this video is very manipulative and making us brainwashed or whatever the fuck it is and that he just wants he’s career back. Obviously he would want that to happen and IT’S NOT BEING MANIPULATIVE. This video is simply just a message from albert himself that he is learning from he’s mistake and showing us that he is changing. He literally got he’s career taken away from him. His passion for music and he’s talent, all gone.  Also, for those people who keeps saying that he doesn’t need a therapist for cheating, you are wrong. Just imagine all those backlash he received from strangers around the world, even going too far like death threats and etc. I bet he is still receiving a lot of those until now. All of this crashed him mentally. “He should know the consequences that will happen after what he did. This is normal, he needs to deal with it.” Yeah, whoever you are, you have a point but getting death threats from people is NEVER normal. What the fuck? You never know how much this can damage someone both mentally and physically.  I just wish everyone would just let him live in peace. I’m not saying that you need to like him, i do not care whatever you think but just stop hating on him and leaving unnecessary comments that won’t probably give a good effect on anyone, especially albert. I also hope that everyone keep in mind that lily forgave him and is now with michael which is really good to see.  I just really wanted to voice out my opinion on this situation and thank you if you’ve read until here. Please respect my opinion.
<3
Dou
Not talking about the message you gave, but the video itself was one of the most well made videos i've seen in a long time! Keep it up and I'm curious what you're gonna upload next :)
welcome back man
7:15 is it just me or does the background music that is being played sounds like sunshine and butterflies from comfi beats if it is , is it some kind of message from Albert .
Some people are Hating the Guy like they are some PERFECT being, at some point of life things go Wrong and we make Bad  choices but what the important thing is YOU REALISE WHAT YOU DID WRONG AND LEARN  FROM IT.   That's why I Admire ALBERT, with this video i realize he Suffered and paid the price of his wrong choices and most importantly he Corrected his ways.
Well we are human beings after all that's all I want to say. PS: I wanna learn how he edit so good.. ALBERT MIND TEACHING? XD
So when is Fed going to make a video like this?
I wish you the best Albert.
You know, many people do some crap, and the consequences of their actions are not something we should all gasp about, because it's predictable. But we all should just let bygones be bygones and support Albert in his recuperation, 'cause it hit him also really hard... Viel Gluck, Albert.. Stay safe in this trying times
Look if Albert wants to redeem himself as a content creator and do what he wants. Changing for the better is much nice than staying exactly how you were no matter how many mistakes you've made
Not many people support you in these times. Make you look inhuman and its the worst for people who admit they made a mistake. You don't deserve to lose your career over this. I'm subscribing and supporting you to get you back on track. Get back on your feet.
I know you made a fcked up mistake but I still welcome you for coming back. Your a human like me I also fck up sometimes. So if I were you I wouldn't hate him cause that's not gonna help him. Don't waste your time putting a hate on a person. As a human being help each other. Try to welcome him as a new man.
I don't know how to feel about this, I still feel very hurt from what happened to party involved but he seems like he's changed a lot and turned over a new leaf.
Albert is such a good videographer
Hi stranger vibes
the production on this is great holy shit
The only grudge I hold against Albert is that he ate like there was no tomorrow and still looks like that.
Love the cinematography. More life my dude 😂😂
To be honest... This video... It's really amazing... It's not an apologetic video but a self-reflection one. Dude, He did a lot of bad things and good things. He did fcked up a lot but one thing for sure that this video really hit me hard to be honest. It kind of made me realized what he was doing was also the right thing about social distancing. Not staying in social media for a while and just self reflecting a lot. If I were him, I would not have survived from the guilt of what I have done to my friends and family. I think people should start letting this go. I am not saying that we should forget what he has done in the past but we need to stop saying sht to him about it. Lily has already forgiven him and has moved on. He started finding new things to do and changing himself is one big important thing in life. We really need to stop bashing/flaming people about this unless you don't have a life and just want to keep doing that cuz you are not able to forgive. At least he's a human being able to know what he has done and who he really is...
Best wishes on your self growth, I know you've probably heard a bunch of different things already and my voice is probably going to be among those but may your resolve be strong in acting upon your wish to be the man your grandmother believed (my condolences to her).
Albieeeeeeeeeeeeeee, we mishheedddd youuuuuu
Albert you proved that you fucked up by making job and relationship too close to each other, yes. But you also proved that now you have the power and the confidence to change and make really freaking good content 👀 That video alone, taking out the context of it (which I did because we all do mistakes...) Is really well written and edited ! A huge bravo to that and I can't wait for the next projects !
I have no background info on what happened or what he did but all I know is that this video was very, very good
Bro, this is the greatest apology video I have ever seen on YouTube. Hands Down. Also, this feels so much like a Wes Anderson short film. Big respect, man.
everyone's shitting on Albert but not sarah? Lol
5:20 That's a bit too exact
I’m genuinely happy for you, good job albert. (Eee totally not tearing up)
well thats a good video good on you Albert keep moving forward.
This is how lily felt now you and lily are even I still don’t forgive you
This is well crafted
Hey Albert, you don't know me but I've been a fan for quite a while. I just want you to know that your mistakes does not make you who you are, everyone makes mistakes, even/especially those who tweets or posts crap because of what you've done. This does not justify your mistakes but this opens an opportunity for you to improve what is left to be improve with yourself. It is really brave of you for bringing out this video to let people know how and what you're up to. Some of your friends still probably hate you for what you did but your real friends, no matter how stupid your mistakes were, will still be your friends in the end and they won't hate you because they would rather see you as a human being more than your sins.   Pull yourself together. Keep on doing what you do best. Strengthen your relationships with the people you have left and gain more real friends as you journey ahead. It's not over, nothing is too late. Start fresh.   I hope to see you wherever you'll stream again, but this time I hope to see the brand new Albert Chang. Hopeful, lively and happy. You are not alone and never were.  "When life leaves us blind, love keeps us kind"
Did this man just make an apology, a return and a short film *all* in one amazing video? This is great.
We are all humans after all, mistakes are a part of us and we have to know how to accept them.
ive never done what albert has, but I've been where he has. it's honestly dark, and while the things you do are inexcusable, you do terrible things when you're lost just to find something to cling on to again.
Good luck Albert.
welcome back, king.
Good for you lad I respect your drive to be a better person and hope you achieve what you set out to do.
I understand your pain and suffering idk why, I’m glad you are going to a rebirth. Your pain feels so unbearable
“It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation but you can lose it in a minute”  As long as he is willing to spend the rest of his life to fix his mistake, then i see no problem in reaccepting him onto the internet
Man Albert. Gotta respect the man, both how he handled his return, and this pretty cool video, I hope his community will support him on this new path, the man deserves another chance after trying this hard
I feel bad but you never have this problem if you never have friends or a career because you can't lose what you don't have
I was never part of this drama but lately I learned about it. I'm glad you're learning from your mistakes and I hope you'll not make them again. All the best in finding your happiness.
why is this like  a movie idk maybe thats how he likes to make content but it seems a bit much if its just a apology but if this a story then this is good
Welcome back, Albert. <3
as someone who fucks up all the time too... I get it :) this is the way and youre doin good
I have no sympathy for cheaters. Ew.
Song at 5:10 ?????
welcomeback :)
Can someone please tell me what he did wrong
Firstly, I want to say the production quality of this was through the roof. Glad to see it. Secondly, i personally think he deserves to come back and prove who he really is. I have friends that I know have done the same thing, but I actually see that most of them are happily married now. Not to say it right, but unfortunately, it is quite common. I do believe the overly used belief that you can define someone by how they get back up, not by their past mistakes. I think Albert is going the right direction, and am keen to see what he creates and how he grows. I still am a big otv fan, but I also am a fan of sleightly musical, because they create things I enjoy to watch
if Lily can forgive him, then so can we
This is the 2nd worst apology video of all time
hey, im supporting you
Hey i missed you :(
Forgive and Forget. :)
I'm sorry for the loss of your nainai.
Do you think fed will make something like this?
I really wanna see Albert Vs two set violin tbh , is a great content to begin with.
I am genuinely happy you are back, and it's not like I don't believe everything you say in this video. However, it kind of felt to me like this was an extremely well-produced way of not taking any blame.
possibly the best comeback video ever made, you gave everyone enough time to move on which i think they did, everyone fucks up in life and i had people doing me way worse and never get canceled. Just because you're a public figure shouldn't mean there's no coming back, so welcome back bro, good to see you.
I am legit mad at youtube for not putting this video in my recently uploaded or recommended section two weeks ago. Shit happens. Lilly forgave and moved on and he didn't forgive himself and still trying to move, cut him some slack gl bro.
Ngl thought he was gonna say cat after no dogs.
Im gonnabe honest, im glad to see albert again
im proud of you.
I feel like we were all with the intention  here to make a hate comment and I still am but I hope you get better .ok have a good day and good luck
as a fan of offlinetv, i do admit i had a really hard grudge against albert. i was slighted when i saw this video recommended to me. however, after watching it, i feel almost near to tears. people make mistakes. what matters most is if they work on redeeming theirselves through self-reflecting and acknowledging their mistakes. i feel like that is something albert has done and will continue to do.   thank you for this video.
He still cheated on lily tho
this is self indulgent bull shit
honestly I wanna see lily react, as well as the rest of the otv crew
A problem with the internet is they see everything as personal. "My favorite person was wronged, I feel wronged myself". They are enraged by things unrelated to them, even more than the people involved. Even when the parties involved in it has already moved on, the "fans" still hangs on to that anger. I was like this a few months ago, until a youtuber pointed this out. You should never focus on Dramas, Getting Triggered, etc.. I use to hate albert just because of the accident, but Why? because he made a severe lapse of judgement that cause to hurt someone I was a fan of? Yes, that was the reason. Which looking back now shows how the internet works or rather, how fanbases work. We view them as Idols, celebrities, GODS!!!!(JK). When they are just people who makes mistakes and grew from them. Glad you're back Albert. I may not be a fan before, I am a fan now.
Im just here for the talent not the personal life
It's good to see you after a year. Loving the way how you accepted all your mistakes. Keep moving brother! There's a lot of us who wants to see you to feel happier!
This video is fucking amazing. The editing, camera work, voice, pacing... I mean wow. We believe in you Albert! Keep on keeping on!
Nice video Albert. Waiting for a lot more from you!
Good job.    Also, awesome cinematography!
some of yall have the audacity to be all "ok he still cheated tho"  if his friends, loved ones, and lily can forgive him, why not us.  dead ass, tf did albert do to yall to be this mad lmao   did he steal yall's cookie or smth
tell me, what happened? I don't know this dude so what was his fuckup?
It was never my place to despise you, hate you, or, well, say anything about a personal issue that should stay personal. Lily forgave you. It isn’t my place to say that I forgive you, since you haven’t done anything to me but- you’re working hard. Working hard to be a better person. You’re doing a good job, Albert. You’re doing the best I can and that’s the most respect that. I hope you reach your goal, Albert :). I’ll be here- supporters will be here too. Can’t wait to see the rest of your journey bud :).
Anybody know where he got that coffee grinder from
i know this is late welcome back albert. i dont think any of u have the right to hold a grudge against him if lilly had already forgiven him.he fucked up but who havent thats what makes us human
T H E   B O Y S   A R E   B A C K   I N   T O W N
fed taking notes lmao
I can forgive albert for everything but...... 5:38 how dare he burn thomas.....
dont worry about it once i heard about micheal and lily i forgave you i just wanted to see you again
Mr Robot Vibes.
Welcome back, Albert. You're human. Everyone makes mistakes. Happy that you're doing okay.
As a person who just started to followed the 'group' recently and started to dig in the past, curious what happened with the members, I'm happy that you've learned to forgive yourself. Because as much as we've yearn forgiveness from the people we've hurt, the first step for it is to forgive yourself. Good luck on your future plans. You'll do great Albert.
Albert, I rarely comment on videos and I doubt you'll read this but I genuinely wish you all the best. One mistake isn't worth an eternity of condemnation.
Damn. Gotta admit this vid looks sick.
Welcome back! I've honestly been waiting :D I dont know what else to say but I'm really happy that you're back
" It was then I understood, without my career and people I cared about in my life...I didn't know how to *be happy alone.* " This. THIS. This is the sentence I've been looking for when talking about self-help. Life is a multiplayer game for a reason, self-help is just another resource for you to grind.
Albert as much that you were a jackass for cheating on lily. You were willing to admit that what you done is a mistake. but it is not for me or people on the internet to forgive you. People would always talk shit on you for cheating on lily. But i wish you good fortune on making your life better. If you prove yourself to become better then that is enough and learn from your mistake.
Maybe im a literal nobody in this and maybe Albert wont see this but im actually really happy that this is happening and i wish you all the best
This video...is a top notch quality video...the content, the narration, the presentation, all just so, so, amazing. Albert you've got so much talent, its not my place to forgive but I'm ready to start watching your videos now, I don't know if we'll ever forget this mistake, but I'm excited to see more content from you. Just from this video alone I could see just how much you've changed since, and I can't tell for sure if it's a good change but time will tell ❤️
This video is so well done. I relate a lot at the part where he said that a passion can be burnt out if it turns into work.  Its something that people that pursue their passion doesn't tell you. And i know the drama of him and Lily still has some of you angry but Im happy to see him come back as an improved version of himself. He is changed for the better and learning from mistakes and thats really the best case scenario that could've happened.
okay I know what he did was "wrong" but I don't think people like us should give him shit for it, he cheated on he's girlfriend, he probably had a motive for it, like he probably didn't like lily anymore or something far beyond that, I'm sure there's over like 5k gamers on twitch and YouTube who cheat on there girlfriend, like Dr disrespect HE CHEAT ON HE'S WIFE, LIKE HE'S WIFE WIFE, that's worse then girlfriend bc they swore to love each other, but the internet let him off like it was nothing and it only lasted like a month I think, Albert has been punishing himself for like a year, and he's still getting hate for it till now, all I'm just tryna say is that shit like this happens all the time, people become "girlfriend and boyfriend" it never last forever so don't count on it, eventually someone of the lovely couple is going to do something, like  Albert did, the internet just takes it to a whole other level like it's there relationship.
Holy crap, so i didn't know about the breakup and aftermath until maybe 6 months after it had all happened. I didn't know OfflineTV enough to dig and find out what happened but eventually pieced it all together. I enjoyed the videos where everyone was together, including you Albert. You've already explained in the video that you know your mistakes and are working towards a better version of yourself but goddamn bro, you just made 90% of content creators in Fiji cringe at their work because this videography was top notch! Hope you get back on your feet as soon as possible and there will always be an audience for you, good or bad, we shall support you since everyone makes mistakes, it was just unfortunate that you were popular enough to get global hate for it.
We are here for you albert you made mistakes but your matter was handled very harshly and many people said something they weren't supposed to it was not right of them
When he said " and many other people closest to me" at 0:52 he showed Lily. Love the details of this.  Amazing videography and editing. Hope you're doing great 🤙🏻
Dang... that’s it... that’s all I got to say.
4:45 oof
Whoa
Very good video, really liked the editing and tone, good job.
Good production quality.
i literally don’t understand why albert is getting so much hate for his return. the point of his video was to let him vent and was for himself. this isn’t for the viewer. this isn’t an apology to you. it’s about albert, and his effort to be better. people shouldn’t be hating on him for something that the viewers shouldn’t have been involved in. the only people involved should’ve been the ones affected. everyone is trying to claim that he fucked up and that he should just make a “normal” apology video. he made a formal apology on twitter when the incident happened. this is albert’s way of apologizing to himself. us viewers shouldn’t be involved in the first place. he even apologized and accepted the fact that he fucked up both in this video and his original apology on twitter. it’s been a whole year since the incident. lily has gotten over it herself. it’s time that everyone else should. sorry for the small rant, i know i’m a bit late to the party, but welcome back, albert. i hope you find happiness and success to come.
SlightlyMusical  I want you to do better. I want you to change the story and change yourself for the better. Because we need, I need, more examples of people who make awful, terrible decisions and find a way back from that dark place inside ourselves. I’ve always liked the idea of redeeming the antagonist because I don’t believe people are cruel or terrible for the sake of making others suffer.   To put it bluntly I’m trusting you to prove to me that people who have made bad decisions can change themselves into something they can be proud of. And I truly. Genuinely hope you succeed.   Good luck Albert.
Nothing else to say than this video was a master peice. Some people may never forgive you, but as long as you rember what u have done and learned from it, to never repeat your mistakes. Then you have grown.
Keep the hair.  Reflects your new maturity.
When you hit rock bottom... the only way left is up.
No hate, just love. I've been following offline tv a few weeks ago and I'm late on everything, and I agree you really fucked up and hurt a lot of people, but I just want to say that you made good decisions after what happened, you did good. I can see where you're coming from, and I'm inspired of how well you managed despite being a target of hate that is much more greater than the average.   Hope you find happiness, and please  keep on doing what you love.
dude i always forgave Albert because everyone fucks up in life one way or another, big or small. and seeing this makes me super excited about him coming back. Keep doing what you're doing man. You've got my full support
he got cancelled for cheating? lol.. not really anyones business
In my opinion, I believe that Albert wants to change and become a better person. So, we have to help him by believing in him that he has changed and wants to learn from his mistakes. Let’s just acknowledge the fact that he took his time to realize what he did and what needs to change. It’s not in our position to forgive him but what we can do is help him. Welcome back Albert 😁
Telling someone to go kill themself for something like this is the lowest of the lowest thing you can do...he didn't rape anyone he didn't kill anyone! Ok he cheated but the punishment doesn't fit the crime.
We're all human we all make mistakes the fact that you acknowledged your mistakes and are willing to make a change means that you are already better than when you started. I hope you find what you are looking for in life and that you find happiness in whatever you do.
You are very welcome back. Remember you only do mistakes once unless you wanna fuck up even more. Lesson learned I suppose.
Yo, I completely forgive you, i wasn’t really aware of OfflineTV or LilyPichu until michael featured her. and then i figured out what happened. I got a little furious, but then I remembered that I don’t resent people who make mistakes. This might have been a good thing, and you learned from what you did, and I respect that and respect you. So play that violin like ur life depended on it, you are an awesome human being.
The highest quality apology video I’ve ever seen
You can do it!!
You got this!
Keep going!!
You can better yourself!
I believe in you, Albert.
Hey! I am clearly in no position to hold grudge to you but what you did is really a meh but if you really did change then that's a super wonderful thing! ill happily join you in your new journey :)
Tf cheating little snake.  How dare u show your face again.  Michael is 100x better than u and he’s addicted to crack.
I know what he did was bad but this is a very good video that he has put his heart and lots of effort into and I hope he can get back up to being one of the best streamers
Honestly, if you cheated you deserve that. *"you reap what you sow"*  Although I don't pity you because of what you've been through and all the other karma, still, you've made a great video and you've regretted - that's deserving of a second chance.
Gorgeus
Amazing! work and can't wait to see the real you
Honestly this kind of mistakes happen it never justifies anything saying that but it doesnt define people the internet blew it out of proportion everyone felt for the respective parties and life always goes on. Yeah her friends her really good friends will probably dislike you for however long the deem worthy but it doesnt mean their arent billions of other people in the world to be your friend and understand you made human mistakes and like you said some friends still cared when everything fell apart.
This man just earned a subscriber.. I've never cared for his content before in the past personally, but I look forward to seeing who he becomes and learning from his faults!  To all the people that are still for whatever reason pissed off or are incapable of forgiveness for whatever reason... get the fuck over it! Liiiike seriously, this guy has done nothing to you, he still deserves to live his life and improve himself and you have no reason to be upset in the first place!! Its not like he took someone's life.. if you've been cheat on before, get over that as well! Life goes on and no one is stopping you from moving on..  All I can say is, this man deserves my sub.
All the sentimental important stuff aside, the shot at 11:54 is absolutely stunning.
I don't want to play down what you did, but everyone makes mistakes. You shouldn't jugde someone for something they have already regretted and suffered for. It is over, the best thing to do is move forward with it in mind so that you don't repeat it and try to regain the trust you lost
Why does this remind me of Joe from the Netflix series "You"
Hey Albert, I fucking loved the movie. Hope to see other projects like this in the near future. 🔥🔥
Goodluck on changing Albert, welcome back to content creation
It was honestly really rough watching Lily go through all this but she forgave him and found love again. And even though it was really bad, everyone fucks up. Some harder than others, but I don't think the public reaction was appropriate. I'm not a fan of the whole cancelculture thing, more often than not it's people arguing about something that is none of their business. Success is worth nothing without failure, I hope he can find his success again.
Ok the reminder note was kinda funny.
Good job man, good luck again and hope to see more of you, also can you share the recipe for the bread? 😅😂
i feel like im watching a netflix series
You know thisbis from the heart and just wants to share it, no ads , THIS MASTERPIECE has no ADS
This is the best video I've seen all decade.
I'm still ya fan ❤️
I despise what you did.. But sincerely, welcome back. I hope for great things, chin up, and positivity for you moving forward.
Depressed albert makes better content.
Proud of you Albert and your resolve to striving to becoming a better you. Welcome back. You're in my prayers and intentions.
this is some quality
Why did you have to make my cry my fucking eyes out
this was worth the 9 month wait! Welcome back Albert :)
ITS OK BRO...START FRESH
This such a well done video.. it is hard to forgive and forget.. But atleast learn to move on and just vibe and have fun..
Aw. This is so cinematic and full of soul. You'll get lost watching and listening to it. Although I don't know his past, well only a little bit. I know that the girl he hurt already forgiven her and I'm glad that he is forgiving himself too.
ALBERT I MISSED YOU MAN, Ngl this video inspires me to find what I can do to make myself happy
super dope video
One thing is for sure he is DAMN GREAT at making Video.  Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect and this world certainly do not need more hatred! I Wish you all the best Albert in your future endeavours.
This is so inspirational.
no matter what has happened, this video's editing and quality is pretty awesome.
In all the footage I have seen of this guy he seems like a massive arrogant douche. This video just confirms it for me.
Man, that was moving. Keep it up Albert!
Future, Fed and Alber made a group called online TV make better videos invite better friends better streams better things and better future! :, )
Welcome back mate 😁
Good Luck with your future endeavors :)
this is amazing
the editing tho
We all know what he did was bad but why are people going so hard on him?!?!? Your good friend sitting next to you might have a cheating issue, cheater or being cheated on, it’s a ridiculously common thing. So why is this dude who apologises for his mistakes getting so much fire? just because he owes it to the world being an “ online” person?.
7:12 liberty hill kicks differently.
im really glad that albert changed. i wish him a goodluck on the road he's gonna take now. and please  don't hate albert now, lily had forgiven him and albert already change. im sure that albert wont do it again. and i wish he wont
I've misjudged you man... I thought you were a complete asshole after you cheated on Lily. But now I see a guy who made a mistake. We all make mistakes, it's a part of being human. I'm so sorry man.
I luv how He puts Lily's on the "LOVE ONE'S"
everyone makes mistakes... dont overcriticise yourself
I really love the video. At first when I hear the news I was shock between you and Lily. I grown to hate you but when I thinking over these past few years it’s just that humans isn’t perfectly that you and I wanted it to be. Human may fallen in depths failures but we as humans never gave up because us humans learned and strive to become better not perfect but progress. And I’ve grown not to hate you but to understand you more Albert. Thank You 🙏🏻🙂🙂 and Welcome Back!!! ❤️❤️❤️
This was a cinematic masterpiece first and foremost and I'm pretty sure that everyone is more than willing and ready to forgive you, now we're just waiting on fed
I know people are probably gonna get on albert's case first, but im just realizing that THIS MAN OWNS A FONTAINE 500S, THIS MAN IS A CARDIST.
Man maybe all the shit happend but still this video looks so god damn good
1:58 the name of the users XD ElonMusk21, Joe Momma XD
You did it albert, you evoke my emotions, ngl I felt annoyed at the beginning of the video but by the end I find myself holding back tears.
Ngl I’m glad ur back
Glad to see you were able to move past your mistakes and started making awesome content again! keep it up
That mistake you made, just made a beautiful chapter in your life
Dude all this time he was gone he was just making this video chill.
If there’s ANY way of coming back. It’s this right here.
I know that what albert did was horrible, but omg this video is straigt up a masterpiece. I really think that albert improved as a person. I could really feel his resolve through this amazing video. I believe that people can change. If you read this I wish you the best albert. cheers
10:18 not gonna lie looks like tyler1s kitchen
Ill be honest I thought Albert would look fat or buff as hell but he still looks the same
<3
Albert deserves a second chance. Though what he did was terrible, it was a personal issue that didn’t need to turn into career ending drama.
Dear Albert, you are so talented! I`m glad you are back, and wish you the very best! Cheers to a new beginning!
Good shit
Great editing, cool video, love the thought process, glad to have you back. We all make mistakes and if people around us are able to forgive than we are given a second chance. Looks like you are on a good path. Be yourself. Good stuff.
I was a "ghost" fan for a while, tuning into the streams when Albert was on and just having it run in the background. It was my source of comfort listening to his streams while struggling to survive life in general. When shit hit the fan, I couldn't help but feel disappointed, shocked and removed him from my list of followed content creators. But, the fact he's owned up, he's striving to become a better person and the one he hurt has forgiven him, I feel like Albert deserves a second chance. Take care of yourself Albert, I and many others are excited to see you grow to become the better person you strive to be from here on out.
Forgiving oneself is hard. Sometimes you may take forever...and still don't. At least that's me
I remember talking to a therapist sometime ago when I had gone to therapy and I can distinctly remember her telling me "everyone deserves help. no matter if they have done "horrendous" actions, I'm here to help them become better people and resolve their issues that they have.
holy shit this vid so high quality its like a fuckking movie
Welcome back Albert!
This video is a masterpiece
This is a 5/10 apology. A bit too cinematic and overproduced and even then it didn't touch on the reason why he was at fault much. Taking accountability is one thing and telling your tragic side of the story for 10 minutes straight is another. For example, Jenna's apology. What Jenna Marbles did was taking accountability. She presented what was wrong and said sorry. He made a blanket statement, disappeared just to reappear again to force your sympathy with a well made sob story. This is far from an apology and more like story time to be honest. So unlike the death threats, I'm going to say something constructive. Post your hour long Twitch stream here talking about it in detail instead of this Draw My Life video you made.
Wow this is really great Albert . I've learned a lot of things from this and we hope you get better and start again anew.
I Wish the best for you and any one who wishes to be a  better person
Jeez... that part about the gym hit hard, and is really motivating after seeing how much you have improved in the past year.
You are a world of talents, do what you do best for yourself and others who actually recognize you. I wish you the best and will stay as a ongoing subscriber. I'm also very sorry for your loss & wish for you to stay strong and stay safe. - HangingWithDan aka Daniel
The best way to come back from being cancelled is by creating positive and high quality content like this. I think your brand will be better than ever before because of the cancellation. You reflected and have the courage to making a comeback, for that i and i believe a lot of people will support you!
so like... you doing a short film now? thoses are fun to make
This shit made me cry and honestly it's making me reflect on myself as well. I think I really needed this too.
Albert we believe in you.
God damn the production quality on this
That was actually inspiring. You dont need to do the same things he did (which it wasn't a crime) to know the feeling of rock bottom and to try forgive yourself and have acceptance from others
Albert you fucking got this bro take all the time you need! Well always understand
Welcome back
I don't care about anyone says! This short film is awesome! I want more.
Don't know who you are, or what you've done, and i think its fine that way and not to know. Cuz this was a great first impression. I wish you the best of luck, Albert. And if you don't know where to go, look toward God.
Had never heard of you before this video. This was so well edited. Wow. Subscribed!
Any one who dislikes this is just outright toxic! He said sorry and he even sounds sorry. If that is not enough, then you are the most toxic person online! Have some sense!
KYLEE
The return of the great forsenCD
Welcome back King

I thnk albert is a nice genuine person apart from the lily incident but i have forgiven him for that and hope he can start a new life and make a name for himself again looking forward to watching more of ur videos 🖤
i respect albert , even tho he made a mistake , its normal , everyone does , so pls everyone stop hating him ...
7:11 "Liberty" Hill
Yall are too invested into others personal lives. This shouldnt even be a youtube issue to begin with. OTV wrong for making it youtube drama
i'm so happy for you, Albert!
Nice man it’s ok we aren’t human if we don’t make mistakes  So I forgive you Keep up the good work  Nice vid man  I know what I’m saying won’t mean much but DONT GIVE UP 😊 ✌️ 👍
Welcome back!
yo im actually crying rn welcome back
Here to show some love, and you deserve a second chance. Good luck bro, and keep your head up.
7:40        not trying to be weird but liberty hill (?)
U know what whosoever is ready this ...life's short.death is inevitable.so do what really means. If it's u Albert ,stop reading other comments (if u don't want to).Do what u think is good.This video is a great first step. If it's u Lily,( chances are as most people are saying u just don't care cause u've already forgiven him I think).Do watch this .If u wanna support or not it's completely up to you . My message is mainly for us fans to spread happiness and positivity .If we support he will comeback for sure and even if he doesn't that's ok. .We are humans we all are fucked up .Time is less .Stop fearing /thinking about your future and past but be afraid to never take steps to do something good ,to not live a fulfilled life. So that in just b4 the moment u die u have a smile.😊  Spread happiness everyone. Love, Moon❤️
You all guys forgive Drdisrespect so Forgive him to
As most I never liked him, this has incredible quality
This isn't something to flame either parties on social media about; this is their problem alone,  and what matters is that they've both moved on. (hopefully but idk im not lily or albert)
not gonna lie chief this is wholesome
Damn dude, this actually got me in the feels. Thank you for the video, thank you for your genuine feelings and thank you for showing me that things do get better.
Those are Pegasus 36s or are those Pegasus 37s? Running shoes do be kewl.
Welcome back. I am in no place to say I hate you, nor can I say you're forgiven, but I'm glad you're back.
I'm new to the drama. So is the sauce that he cheated on Lilypichu?
That was so well made I actually felt a person could change.
Welcome back
Damn this is the sickest comeback wtf?
Beautiful and inspiring video, I'm glad you've been working on yourself. Like really good edits. Really good.
Welcome back albert we missed u ❤❤
I gotta give it to you the edit is amazing, i dont agree with ur past choices, but you know, everyone deserves a 2nd chance, so good luck from now on, u do have talent.
Give a Ted talk will you, that was inspiring. Respect
ily bro itd ok, we all make mistakes
When I also made terrible things and hit rock bottom. Thinking about many things. Losing your passion about everything. I realized when we are child we have no dream and one day. Boom. We have a dream. So I started by desiring to dream again. Doing "something" again . You don't know me but we shared the same brokenness. But the main point here is. "Welcome Back"
You and Lily were my biggest inspirations and I was hurt after hearing what you had done. Its not my place nor anyones place to hold a grudge against you, In the end, Lily was able to forgive you and its clear that she moved on. Out of respect for Lily I believe that her fanbase should respect her opinion and forgive and move on from the past. Its very clear Albert has become a changed man during his hiatus, and hes growing as a person. Someones past doesn't define themselves, and Albert has learned from his mistakes. Overall your actions and mistakes do not define you as a person. Welcome back Albert.
To those people who were lost as of the moment need to watch this video.  I love how this guy managed to survived from the storm.  You deserved to be happy too.
Wish you the best luck!
i love you albert, be a better person than that fucked albert i believe in you. and pls learn from ur mistakes, ur amazing and ur growing. life is what u make it. 🧡
???:?:)2$)3); why did i cry watching this
I don't forgive you, but my forgiveness means nothing to you, so welcome back and try not to severely fuck up someone's trust in you again.
Everybody makes mistake. We're always here for you sir albert
Zayn Malik cheated on Perrie Edwards and broke up with her through text but didn't get cancelled, and Albert gets cancelled smh
He's happy, Lily's happy.  I don't know why people are angry. Live a life dude...
This is a perfect Wong Fu video lol
that yest one was wholesome.       until he ate it.
you made a tear in my eye and i happy for your return, this video was great it is a perfect restart, this is one of those motivational videos i will be watching whenever i feel down, thanks albert and wellcome back if i could i would hug you.
While I’m sure Albert is a better person now because of his past mistakes think about where we would have been if no one found out about the affair.
well I don't know you that much, all I know is the memes about you and you know, I'm gonna tell you this, If you're really sorry for what you did and swear that you will never do it again, then you're all good don't let others dictate your life, If you want to come back sure, if not that's ok too. Basically what I'm trying to say here is.. be you (Even though I don't know you that much).
Aww
Hey, it really has been a while, we're glad that you're back~ I hope that you can find your happiness soon.
why does it feel like he was the one cheated on lol i missed this guy this has inspired me to change.
Fuck, this made me ugly cry
Good luck
Just be a editor
ive never really liked this guy and this content and what he did with lily was pretty bad but for some reason, this is fucking awesome. Im subscribing lol. People make mistakes, I for one know the best but im all for this self rebuilding self improving stuff. keep doing you Albert!
6:47 Yvonnie punching the air rn
Man I freakin love this comment section. Everyone is positive af
Short film featuring Albert and his Yeast boi? Yes pls
ppl judging albert like they are the perfect human being, trust me if you never did a huge mistake in your life its not because you will not but u just didnt yet, and he is right what define a person is what they do after a mistake, he already got the punishment let see he build himself a new identity
I really enjoyed watching this video as this gave me a lot of insight in regards to making mistakes can lead to consequences, but in doing so we're all human and we all make mistakes because we're not all perfect we don't know the boundaries that can lead to a big fuck up. It's a process and that big year can either benefit of the doubt or nothing will change. I wish Albert the best and hope he can become a better person and I wish that change can reunite everyone together :)
damn that made me cry
wishing nothing but the best for you man, everyone makes mistakes but the point of life is learn from those mistakes. Im actually so happy for you <3
I know that he cheated, and I still think it's not okay. However, I feel like he's at least trying to change, and I genuinely want him to change. I want to see the people who are his friends, and not his fans/former fanbase forgive him. I think this is a mark of the start of a journey for him, and I want to see him happy, changed, and stabler. I'm not saying I've forgiven him. He's done nothing to me, and any of the rest of his "former fanbase". The people he affected were those who were close to him, not strangers on the internet whose names he doesn't know. I barely even knew about him before the whole cheating thing. But I do think that even if he fucked up, I want to see him earn a smile and then spend it.  On that note, I've subscribed, so that if he posts anything else, maybe another sign that he's trying to be better, I can see that too and support him from an immeasurably far distance away. The people he hurt are okay now, and he's owning up to his actions. I look forward to seeing what he's doing now. I'm actually really optimistic.  I'll be honest, I kind of foreswore any content involving Albert in it before now. I couldn't see him as anything other than the guy who cheated. But I'm thinking of making a conscious effort to take a look at the guy people liked, and see the facade he had to put up, so that I can see the real person he's working towards being and see how far he's come.  Albert is probably not reading this. I'm fairly aware of that. On the off chance you are, though, keep up the good work. You may have made a huge misstep, but the road to redemption has been walked by countless feet, and I believe you can leave your footprints there.  Godspeed, and enjoy your coffee.
I’m so glad I watched this. At one point dance brought me no joy just stress. But when you said that you went back to see why you even started it made me realize that dance could just listen to my emotions better than many people.I started dance because it was what brought me joy, and I need to stop being to hard on myself. Thank you.
Reminder that he said this isn't really an apology video during a livestream.  Incredible respect to him for probably being one of the only people on YouTube I've seen to handle something of this caliber in such a well developed way. It can only get better.
do you mind if i steal your nautilus?
We all make mistakes. You made a big one. But people do change. Most of the people on the internet are mindless consumers who get a thrill out of canceling “celebrities”. They haven’t grown up, but people like you hopefully have. You’ve done bad things, but what no one is intelligent enough to realize is that this doesn’t define you. Much love brother
I mean.... he could have gotten a fish
welcome back. love the video content
It seems you left this behind mind taking it back 👑
This is a nice video.
Take note Logan Paul, this is how you ACTUALLY fix yourself
Welcome back Albert. :)
You may never see this, but... I want to be a therapist one day and seeing this video, I must say, you are doing so well. Keep learning from your mistakes and continue on the path you're setting right now. Don't give up on yourself and the promise you're making right now. You're a good guy, and it might take time, but it'll be worth it.
Omg I started crying. I’m so happy for him.
I respect that
Albert i hope that you in a short time will be able to forgive yourself and you dont really have to let those people hate on u the only person that can be hating on u is lily and maybe your "old friends"  Good luck
Why is his gym mostly black, he just lives in black lol
Man should make an podcast or some sh*t I’ll binge that sh*t
Hey albie, I feel you and i'm rooting for you. and yea the gym is an awesome place filled w people who don't give a #### about who you are.
I know I'm late, and this entire video is beautifully done, but I absolutely love how it starts with him searching "Sleightlymusical" and finishes with him searching "Albert Chan"
it warmed my heart... I have made mistakes
im not crying ur crying
isnt there a Wendy's you should  be working at?
Took better care of yeast boy than he ever did of Lily
u need to direct every youtubers apology video. i’m tired of seeing someone in a t-shirt and shorts bawling their eyes out with their dog an a video titled “this is the hardest video i have ever had to make”
everyone is acting like people dont grow from their mistakes.
How is the God that knows the lofi songs
Its funny how the person he cheated on forgives him and is on good terms on him, yet random strangers on the internet want him to kill himself.   The internet.
i dont really like what you did to lily but despite that i still love your music! :D so dont waste your talent!!
7:40 Liberty Hill, I don't know if it's intentional, but it's interesting at least
I hate how Albert cheats on Lily and offline tv shows hate towards him but Fed does something way worse and offline tv says please dont send hate towards Fed
I dont wish bad on you or anything but i don't think i can support or watch your content, atleast right now. best of luck you are very talented.
It was ridiculous how good this was.
Amazing video the story telling, the camera setting just perfection. And for everyone still holding on to their grief against Albert I cant understand how you can waste your time hating on someone for something that does not concern you at all. What happened was between him, Lily and his other friends. No matter how big of a fan you are/were this was never about you nor was it ever of your concern, move on and get a life of your own instead of trying to direct other peoples lives. Instead of talking down on other peoples mistakes focus on your own.
Bojack horseman in the background messed me up ngl
Probably the best apology video that will ever exist.
We don't owe content creators anything
This was a great film :). You can bet ur ass ill be here to support!
This video was inspirational as fuck. My god. Honeslty Albert man, you fucked up. Everyone does at some point in their life to varying degrees, but the strong ones are the people that can own up to it and make a change for themselves. Glad youre back out here man and good luck with everything
Lots of respect for doing something like this. Welcome back
netflix should hire him...
wow.
I wish you the best. I honestly feel so bad. I thought this was a just a normal problem but after seeing this video i can see it has really affected you, and the people around you. I wish you happy things  :> (I honestly kinda cried)
Lube your stabs holy shit
this guy deserves happiness like everybody else.
Cool video make another
On the list he has "Fetishize my own sadness" I laughed way to hard 😆  🤣
hey albert im glad you changed almost after a year. im actually quite impressed what youve done through all these days. this actually made me learn more about people, life and that people can change, but it does require a lot of time for themselves and i hope someday i will change too like you did. just take your time and live your life like how you want to albert ❤️
Holy shit that was a god tier movie. Never realized Albert was that good at filmmaking
what sound tracks / songs are used in this video? :O
Everyone that can't forgive Albert needs to look at their own lives and realize they themselves are not perfect.
this has to be the only honest apology video that I have seen...I didn't get to know him before what he did, but I know it was fucked up. But still, no pitty here, I hope he can be forgiven (I know I would think about it twice or more before doing it).
Amazing video! Welcome back.
xD
Good luck
Hate how people are shitting on you. Lots of people have made this mistake or had someone cheat on them. But as your grow you learn to forgive. People want to cancel you even though doc got no backlash when he did it to his wife. People are hypocrites
rofl look this mooove
I hope you are doing well, I'm glad to have you back
Its so weird after finishing this video dreamy night isrecommended   Welcome back sligh...  Welcome back Albert Chang
Really well done video Albert!
All the comments are the same. Lily moved on so its ok. Like what kind of bullshit is that. I agree that he should be forgiven but dont use that. If she killd herself it would have been worse in your opinion?
Thats cool but you shouldnt ever cheat on someone as cute as Lily ruuuuuude
I’ve been watching some other streamers and their chat react to this and most of them have reactions like “farming sympathy huh?”, but I think that they don’t realize that Albert is trying to become a better person. Honestly, I think that cheating is wrong but he should be given a second chance. I mean, everyone makes mistakes and the only reason why people are overreacting is because he is somewhat famous. If it were just some random guy cheating on his girlfriend, only about 15 people would confront him about it, but for Albert he has thousands of people judging him even though he is already changing into a better person. I just don’t understand how people can be so unforgiving, it’s almost as if they’ve never messed anything up in their life.
ForsenCD my man
You deserve a second chance albert. Mistakes happen. But never let that mistake ruin the rest of your life. Everyone moved on and is now time for you too. Your naynay will still be proud looking at you from above. Youre a great man. Sincerely apologized and learnt from your mistakes. Now stand up and show what Albert a.k.a sleightlymusical can do. Ignore fvcktards that bashes you, the important thing is what you see yourself not what others wants you to think you are ☺️ Sending love all the way from Philippines. 💕
Regardless of what he did, this fucking video is good wtf insane production quality damnn
Wow, that was beautifully done.   Hate him or not. You can't deny the effort and hard work that was put into that   New subscriber here
I see naut i forgive
I'm so glad you're back and very excited for your comeback.
People make mistakes, some bad ones and some really bad ones, but I do have to appreciate the courage you have to create this and restart all over again.
this was honestly just fucking beautiful..
Uh no it's 1%hate, 9%memes and 90% understanding peepol.  yeah he did something shitty but you need to understand that the man wants to change, correct he's wrong doings and be better, lily already moved on and she's happy now there's no reason for you to be salty or angry anymore not that you should've even done that because it's clearly not our business to begin with. If you dislike the guy just leave him be and don't be a fckin asshole everyone deserves a second chance.
Damn... this is a YouTube video? Or a movie trailer?
yep acknowledge mistakes , see what's wrong, and try your best to move on. Well done Albert. I'm not a passionate fan of you or you might know who and i got myself watching this thanks to pure random. Therefore i approached this video with the knowledge i had of what you did. ( note that i didn't know what you went through after this ). And i'm quite happy to see that at least the pain wasn't vain   Good luck in your future betterment  and achievments This was a nice demonstration of film making skills. Cya !
Best of luck dude!
I can’t stop laughing at the way he filmed this apology
So beautiful
No one is saint, everyone make mistakes, whats importantly is that we learn from our mistakes. Whatever happened in the past is his business between Albert and Lily. We are not them, we don't actually know them in person, we don't really know every detail of it, and even we do, who are we to judge ???
Insane
I really feel bad about albert why do people get to the point that they want him dead albert is a human to and human make mistake you dont have to make him suicide i mean this dude apoligize to lily and others like hell but people still roast him i hope one day people who hate him understands that mistakes are made to build a better you
Welcome back, Buddy
i understand too well what it’s like to hurt people and have to live with it. i’ve been a bully, a toxic friend, a girlfriend with both commitment and abandonment issues, and i’ve done some things to some people i really cared about that i absolutely should not have. that’s why when all the stuff back then happened i kept quiet, because it’s not my place to criticize someone who made a mistake just like i have and do. you never know what somebody is going through.   albert if you see this, i’m hella proud of you. i know what it’s like to mess up and be remembered as that mistake, not as you. it’s so fucking hard to live with. but only you truly know yourself, and only you will ever truly know how much you’ve grown or changed. so it’s up to you to find that peace within yourself, cuz you can’t get it from other people. forgive yourself and watch how you grow
Missed you so much bro....
Everyone make mistakes, some people regret and apologize, and some people just being arrogant and not open minded. You Albert already apologize and regret what you did, and that's what matter. Continue to pursue your dream, people might not support you but I for sure are here for you.
WE FORGIVE YOU
made me teary-eyed, good job my guy.    also my deepest condolences to yor nai-nai
NGL the video is shot pretty nice
Albert!!! your video is working yayyyy
simply a great video, all the best to you and the journey ahead of you
Be sure to live an honest life this time. And continue doing it. So youll be able to forgive yourself finally. And let those whom you caused pain forgive you too.
chile anyways
just wanna say i love you man. no matter what youre such a great guy and i cant help but support you in whatever you choose to do from now on
This some good videography
You've changed for the better man, Life is just heccin shitty sometimes that u end up doing bad decisions. It's okay, we'll be here for you! Also dayum is this a freakin high budget movie or what??? hahahaha You're always sooo good at making vids~ keep up the very good work albert chang!!!! -3-
We missed u bud :)
Victim Victor
I'm not gonna pretend I was a fan so ya, I mean I'm not particularly into the genre of your old content but I also can't see myself getting into your future content because of what you did. It's kinda like getting a tattoo, nothing wrong with it it doesn't concern others but it's still a fact that some companies will reject you just because you have tattoos. Enjoy your life dude.
how did this man as an extrovert live without friends??
I respect this guy
Ik I’m late but I respect this and this is a great way of returning u admitted ur fault and bettered ur self idc what people say ur better now and that’s all that matters good luck with everything and I’m now here to support u all the way.
I have done the same Mr.Albert  I know may no one give a fuck about mt story but i wanna share it maybe sb or maybe you Albert coulf see that your not alone....  My name is zhiwar and im 19 i was working towards being a doc and i studied hard i had good friends i had a btful girl friend whom had the same passion as me, life couldlnt be better for me but the storm hit and i couldnt get into medical school and my gf left me cuz she said ur not enough and yes i made mistakes we fought along the way alot but we broke up tho it hurts but i must move on now watever i do is just not getting right and idk why.... but i still have hope and just same as u im gonna get up oneday just dont loose hope my friend i believe in you and myself...
lololololol k
Everybody makes mistakes, Albert did one too, It's not our place to hold a grudge. If we don't support him now the world will miss out on his talent, only time will define who he is really    All the best Albert !
This shits deep man    Im not crying   You are
What a masterpiece I cried
idc alberts still cool in my book 😎👍
This is beautiful. I have watched this for 5 hours already
Are you open to questions Albert? I am curious how you stayed above the water financially this year? Only with savings?
Hate him for cheating on lily with sum ugly girl
I thought I was the only who didn’t believe in the do what you love notion
There were probably two general mindsets spread amongst the viewers prior to watching; an open mind and the willingness to listen and forgive or with the mindset of "there is no coming back." Honestly I fell into the latter category. But as I continued to watch, it became increasingly obvious that his reflections, regret, and respect toward the whole situation from everyone's perspectives, him, Lily, their friends, and even the viewers, were all painfully obvious. Even though what he did was terrible, he did his time and not only that but he worked on trying to better himself. I hope your old community welcomes you back with open arms, I hope you're able to reach a new audience on top of that- all for the sake of getting back to doing what you pretty good at; amazing viewers with your big brain tricks and illusions. It really was a feelsgood moment every time I saw you accomplish a trick for the first time and you kinda flip out and I'm sure most people felt the same.   On a personal note: This was amazing. From the message to the production quality, you could tell that every second and every word of it was thought out to every last detail. If I was told to abridge all the unimportant parts of the video, it would still be 11 minutes and 13 seconds and not a second less. You did an amazing thing for your Nai Nai. That little bit had the biggest impact on me and I even teared up because I understand those feelings of not being able to match unrelenting and unwavering love; having to play catch up and trying to deal with the guilt. It's unfortunate that she won't be here to see the influence she's had on from here on out but it won't make it any less meaningful so don't let your resolve waver and set out what you intend to do.
Good luck Albert
Amazing man. Personally I forgive you, and hope that you become a stronger and better person. Welcome back Albert ❤️
Ngl tho the way this video looks and was edited was pretty sick
You know you have a problem when you focus on the result of you being "cancelled" rather than the result of you cheating on and lying to someone 😒
Never let someone’s opinion become your reality. Never sacrifice who you are because someone else has a problem with it. Love who you are inside and out.   - Les Brown
Welcome back dude
great video
from watching this video and your live stream, i personally believe that you've improved. you've become a much better person and you took the best option to better yourself. i'm glad you've received the help you needed.
Yeast..........
CRINGE DUDE
soooo.... is he still dating sarah lee?
It's like half the comments didn't even watch the vid.
Anyone know the song at 10:05?
That's some serious shit! Go man GO!
Idk why I teared up. The video just felt honest I guess? Also, great production! you do really have a knack for it.
I love your content more pls continue the great work ❤️❤️❤️
i always thought you are so cool  like without no flaw at all  im actually glad "that" happen, you can rise again, try again  and to be honest, im still at my hardest time right now too, even if i said that rise stuff  i barely can rise at all, it took me everything just to go out,  your video always amazing, finally i can hear your problem, your story,   this one too is amazing, glad to have u back, Albert!
u can do it
niceee u come backkk
It's been a year and 6.4k haven't forgiven the man yet? You guys really can't move on in life if you're still holding grudges on people that have made the simplest of mistakes.
Wow, to be honest this guy is really good at filmmaking.
Very well edited video, I'm sure most of the people here know what you have done, and some may not forgive you but good work. You probably won't even see this comment but whatever. Just good work.
Way too talented and sincere to stay cancelled.
We live in a world where people make horrible decisions every day. Lily already forgave Albert and has moved on from the drama. Hopefully, Albert can start fresh.
Anyone know the song at 5:10 ?
Mans literally made a whole ass movie
Guys, this is Lily’s grudge to hold. From what I can see Lily has forgiven him a long time ago, has found someone that she genuinely loves and loves her back. It’s been a year, Albert made a mistake and hopefully he won’t do it again and have learned from it. He has a passion for music and he’d like to share it. If Lily is happy, you guys shouldn’t hold anymore grudge. Welcome back, Albert.  —Edit: So many people are slandering Lily, stop. The point of my comment is to literally stop picking and choosing sides. Cheating will always be wrong and should never be ‘just dismissed’. For Albert’s situation on the other hand, he seems to have learned his lesson. Him and lily doesn’t talk anymore and that’s the end of that.
all things aside. the quality bro, THE QUALITY
i'd rather seen a self-reflection and the aftermath of himself from what he's done before kind of video like this, than a video about apologizing and crying for 30 minutes
Welcome back Albert
I feel a lot of the shots are inspired from scott pilgrim vs the world and many other films from Edgar Wright. The production of this video is great btw!
The comments making Essays and im to lazy to read  👁_👁
Albert knows wat he did the u can see the difference between a bad apology video and this he means it I think he did the right thing going off the grid for awhile but also I don’t think he’s off the hook yet I really don’t but I think he has the right idea and if he continues this people will eventually forgive him
Albert, I really respect you for owning up to your mistakes, and not pretend like it never happened. You changed, not only for everyone else, but for your own self. It’s not selfish to try to be a better person yourself, and it’s not selfish to change and learn from your past mistakes.  As they say; you need to love yourself, before you can love everyone else.  What you did will always be present, but all of us will remember that you changed in order for you to be happier, and be a better person, so that what happened will never be repeated. That you owned up to your mistakes, and changed for yourself, and for others. That you didn’t start this channel for fame, or clout, but to share what you loved to do, and many of us are happy that you will continue to do so.  I am used to thinking “If he did it once, he can do it again.”, but this video made me realize all the progress you’ve made, and that you’ve made many healthy decisions recently, and I truly respect that. I’m glad you’ve re-connected with some of your friends, and that they didn’t hold a grudge.  I hope the rest of this community doesn’t hold a grudge either. I’m glad for this video, and glad you’re back.💜
Top 10 anime comebacks................Albert    missed you dude.
beautiful video. missed u albert!
Man the editing of this video is way better than many youtube videos and documentary that i had ever watched. Good job on moving on with the past. Dont worry,  you still have your old fanbase when you begun. As far as i know, you even gain more popularity with what happened and you will gain even more knowing that you changed for the better.
This was the perfect comeback video. Im happy to see that you're doing well and working on yourself. Mistakes may gave been made, but I'm excited to see what comes next.    And fuck dude,  We missed you
Thank you  This is honestly what I think most people want when someone is cancelled.  It’s not an “apology video” with lofty promises to become better. It’s not an excuse. It’s a genuine attempt at improvement.  Here’s to hoping that this can start setting a precedent for self-improvement and growth after a mistake.
Despite what happened in the past. We are proud of you, Albert❣ stay strong
Don’t come back to YouTube you cheater
Albert I forgive you 🥺
Anyone know if the BGM us his own, and if so can someone link it ?
When will you eat the yeast
Wait a minute... this isnt coryxkenshin lmao
That Bojack Horseman on the bg tho
yo, the production for this video...one of the cleanest vids I ever have seen on this platform. Like perfection.
If I was famous I’d be apologizing everyday, but people don’t know me..... I’ll do it anyways, I’m sorry I’m a piece of shit too.
Respect g keep up the good work king!
I'm glad you're back
forsenCD
This has been the longest 11 minutes of my life(in a good way) and I couldn't have been happier to see so much improvement in such a short amount of time. You'll get where you want to be and maybe even further if you keep on doing whatever it is that you're doing right now. I'm sorry for having been a bit aggressive regarding my personal views on you as a person regarding that incident, and I know this probably won't even reach you anyways. But I just want to tell you that there are people who'll be rooting for you, Albert.
👁👄👁 Oop he back
Can we just appreciate how he didn’t put ads in this video?
For the people who still blame Albert and ridicule him for the mistakes he clearly regrets, shame on you. Enough is enough! Albert made a mistake and paid the price. Learn to forgive and forget, lily did and if she has the ability to do so, you should too cuz YOU WERE NOT INVOLVED and it was none of your business. Albert, I wish you the best.
This was very impressive editing.  May you find the goals and future you can strive for.  You fucked up but you've shown you're making progress. But don't stop doing it, keep it up.   Also no one should be holding grudges against you since they weren't the one's to experience it. Only the victims should yet they don't feel that way
At least you’re trying to be a better person, and thats admirable to say the least.
Hey Albert, This reasonated with me, it somehow made me feel less alone when a lot of the feelings you shared I had at some point or another. I hope you continue to do better for yourself and I look foward to see more content from you.
Such a great video.
I wish you all the best buddy, im happy you've returned
Nice, wheres feds video now guys, amirite?
What do you guys want ..  For every person whose ever made a mistake to disappear and die .. ?
dude I just genuinely love this video, its sooo well made its shocking
The overall quality of this video is going through the roof. Nice.
love or hate the guy but i like the video and video editing
pog
Take notes, Logan
LETS GOOOO
Good luck Albert
You look horrible, truly. When you post a serious and well-made production like this, it's difficult to see if you've really changed or whether you've actually repented. It's not my role to bash you or tell you what to do but I sent my regards to your grandmother and hope you become the man you want to be. It's a great gift to humans to have been given the ability to forget and I hope time will wash away the sadness and scars left behind. Although I'm just some random on the internet, I hope this comment will serve you well and balance out the hate you might receive from some other random. Good luck.
Be better.
Good video and i hope you get to youre goal. O and r.i.p to youre grandmom
Its ok Albert,i know that feeling,i messed up too but i just changed my emotion and ignore like there dead but i change that because i was being aggressive then i became a sociapath and having no friends because of my pathetic attitude i was the same as you,i can't say no,i was blind because my friends was using me for my money and i was blind for it,there were happy but not me,i was so sure that they're my friends but no it was sad to know that,i was faking my smile until this day not even my own family know this,so i hide my emotion and pretend there was happiness on me,i was faking it all so no one was going to notice
We can forgive you Albert, but mostly you need to forgive yourself.
If only other content creators can make this type of apology video, those type of apology videos make me laugh and I take it as a joke but this just make feel bad for the guy, this guy's life is already ruined due to his mistake but he is trying to improve himself by therapy. And I don't see any other content creators doing that for being sorry.
I'm not sure if you will see this comment, but I hope you do because I just wanted to say that this video is a true piece of art and it never drew my attention away from it. You are an amazing content creator and I think your grandma would be so proud of you and what you are trying to accomplish for yourself. I may not know the whole story of what happened, but I believe that everyone deserves forgiveness. And you obviously are suffering from your mistake and care to better yourself so you don't do it again which I really respect. You are not a bad person, we all make mistakes. It's how you respond after that mistake that matters. You're on a path of healing and greatness and I wish the best for you and can't wait to see where it goes. Stay strong and keep doing what makes you happy :)
The cinematography, music, dialogue, and editing is 😔👌
This was beautiful :O
This part made me feel bad and cry 9:20
Wow, thank you for this video.
Goddamn. I started crying halfway through, because I felt like I was living the things as you. i hope you the best, and no matter what, i hope I can also be as strong as you. :D
damn the cinematography tho
Hello
Does anyone know the music at the end?
Welcome back... People make mistakes your community isn't gone. Some of us are still here and the past is the past. The future is yet to be known but today is a gift that's why it's called present. Right now at this current time, you're coming back as someone better than before and it's a good thing. That's all that matters.
I wish you the best Albert.
Ignoring anything else, this is a fucking well made video.
woah , this was purely beautiful :")
This is why you'll always be a favourite content creator and person. Looking inwards and genuinely wanting to grow. We all fuck up, the important part is how we react to that.
Finally you are back. Loved your music and videos.
The production value of this doesnt feel formal nor personal. Idk if i can say it was genuine because it feels so artificial. He admitted for his mistakes, but somewhat deflected everything.
those lillies at 0:52 hit me hardest
The message is clear. This is a new Albert. Let's see what's going to happen next.
We all make mistakes man glad ur okey
this video is so cringe.
You know, yeah, it's a mistake, and in life, mistakes like this one aren't the worst. Albert, I hope you can continue on, and I hope you enjoy your content again!   Stay safe out there.
When everything around us seems to fail and we even fail ourselves, God's grace doesn't fail. His grace is enough to support us in all our brokenness.
ngl the film is pretty good
Ayy he still has the gundammmmm
No matter what a hundred million people say, I, as a single human being, will support you.
whos this guy?
Welcome back, Albert❤️
You were my inspiration once, before everything has happened. When you left, I accepted it was a private matter. A silent drop, something shattered. Here I am again on this channel, watching a touching video, feelings that are unexplainable. Yet again you bring me inspiration, after a horrid year of matter.
This 11 minute youtube video is better than almost everything netflix has put out there we truly do live in a society
This man hit rock bottom but now has self improved himself to the point that he is a better person than those haters ever will be! Good on him! 💓
This was an amazing short film. You put everything together nicely.
Yeah of course some netflix type quality video can make up for whatever he did......
the poor egg =(
damn you are good
Hope you stick to it.
As much as I hate you, ngl this video was good. Welcome back.
Good job, good video, I hope you'll do better with your life
if you abstract from everything, you will see that the quality of this video is really good, espesially the analogies
This video made me want to be someone who achieves more in life. I've not fucked up, but I've had my foot off the peddle for too long. Thanks Albert.
I must say, this video production quality is fucking top tier m8. the clones, the text, the timing, the videography are *chef's kiss*. Welcome back Albert
Most genuine apology video I’ve seen.
Keep taking care of yourself :)
Reminds me of Casey Neistat vlogs but it's' like his own style of vlogging.
The important thing is lily forgave him and has moved past this so I think it’s time for him too. He is an amazing content creator who did a mistake. He never asked for our forgiveness but instead he shows us how far he’s come as a person. He has owned up to his mistake. And it’s not like he can sit in his room alone for the rest of his life. He is a human being who has a whole life ahead of him. A mistake shouldn’t be a life sentence. I hope to see you happy too Albert and am exited too see what the future holds!😊
Poki's apologize video aint got sht on this. Man's trying to start clean, in the other hand jz doing whatever sht she could to hang on to her 5m subs
I think a lot of people were pretty mad when they found out what happened between Albert and Lily, but Lily has already forgiven Albert and most importantly, she's happy now. Props to Albert for owing up to his mistakes. He deserves a second chance.
I wonder how much effort you put into this
I hope your grandmother rests well, goodluck albert you are someone I saw and see a lot of my self in
Welcome back albert
We all love ya Albert never forget
The pressure from the internet is way bigger than anyone can imagine, only those who experience it knows and understand fully. Yeah it's not all bad, but it's still something that can change everything for you.... let the past be in the past, people grow up, don't worry Albert keep doing what you want and what you believe!
As much as I hate what happened, I am quite impressed you took some time for yourself.
To those who are unable to forgive Albert, the ones memeing, trolling, and hating on him- One day in the future when you inevitably fuck up in one way or another (as all humans do), think back on this video and remember the comments you have made.
You can tell how much Albert has gone through. You can tell how much effort he put into this video. Big respect from me Albert, I wish you the best of luck.
Hey man good to see you've come far from that point. And good to know that you've worked hard to rise above your mistakes and made yourself better. I wish for things to go better.
If you do bad stuff, than it's not mean you're a bad person...I cheated girls and some of them cheated me, but nobody knows, because I'm not famous 😅😂 You don't need to be depressed, because your fellings are just brain chemicals...your head is fucking with you. Control your feelings and take shit about others, because nobody perfect and not will be. Keep up the good quality mate, cheers.
Welcome back ma dood :3
welcome back BUDDY we were been waiting
albert... you son of a bitch, i forgive you... you made me cry man...  :(
With all these other comments, I'm just curious what the background music was in the last scene?
Aside from alll the drama,wow this video is just amazing
“Mistakes make you stronger” hope u grow to become mentally and physically stronger Albert
💪💪💪
welcome back
7:39 nothing much just casually running past *liberty* hill
Thanks for this Albert.
Man after seeing this while drinking coffe Im actually crying but never then less It's good you came back I missed you <3 :)
Lily forgave him. I still hate what he did, but yall random online strangers have no right to hate on him. You can hate what he did but hating him as a person trying to improve is whack?
plot twist: lily and albert got back together
LOL
this is really cool. i just became a big fan of OTV like a week ago. i’m slowly unraveling their past year of controversies and this one is the one i found today. but honestly it’s really cool to see someone so serious about acknowledging how badly they fucked up and working their ass off the actually do something about it. this video is really nice and honestly not just a good apology video but a good life lesson video. idk albert and i probably won’t be subscribing but boy do i wish him the best in his journey and hope to hear of prosperity in the future
Hate fucking bandwagons are like “guys lily forgave him so we should to” why do you have to fucking forgive someone who you don’t know because someone else says “guys I forgive him” I know Albert and lily are content creators putting their whole life on display but Jesus Christ. I’ve been watching some old ass offline tv videos having Albert, fed, and some other people I had no idea were apart of offline tv and I thought to myself “Albert is really fucking talented” or “Albert is pretty god damn cool”. I don’t know what he did like did he just talk to another girl or did he do the birds and bees. But bottom line Albert is a good person. I’m really happy to hear some of his friends connected to offline tv even reached out. I just dislike people who don’t create their own perspectives and instead just follow someone blindly. I’m not educated enough into relationships and how cheating can hurt but who knows, maybe I’m in the fucking wrong.
i'm happy to see you're doing well. continue to better yourself and i wish you all the best
Noting to say but just one word ' Damn ' understand in your own way
This man is brave !
This guy is coming back stronger than ever. Damn such a good film, multi talents. You are special man.
idk why, got mr. robot vibes
I'm excited to see what you have in store for us!
Ay yo I miss you dude
I'm so proud of you
I like how this is not a video where he asks people for permission and forgiveness. Like it or not, it's a statement that he's moving on for himself and is doing so for self embetterment.
3:50 were you a cuber?
I'm not gonna lie when I first heard what happened with Albert I was furious at him having been cheated on myself but I can see even from this that he's not the same person, he's grown I can't say that I'll be keeping up with him but I don't feel any kind of anger when I hear his name.
nice
I was not someone who knew you at all outside the appearances in other peoples videos, so I can never say i was a fan, and i don't think i'll ever be a fan. But I genuinely feel sorry for you, what you did was shitty and terrible, but you never deserved all this hate for it. Internet fame sucks.  I hope the internet can move on and you can get back to doing what you love(just try to be a better human after all this).
hmmm
I mean do people actually still care about the drama?
Lol
One of the more genuine projects that I have seen on YouTube. You can tell he spent many many hours thinking about this and working through it.  @sleightlymusical don't let your mistakes define you. One of my favorite quotes of all time, which you may find cliché, is this "if possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. That is to say, if you have done what is within your ability to seek forgiveness from other people, and you have forgiven yourself, then live your life as if you have been forgiven. At the end of the day, forgiveness isn't dependent on you or your actions, forgiveness is a choice another party makes to begin to overcome pain that someone has caused them. You seem to regret what you did incredibly so, but don't let that be the reason for your change. Become the man that you are meant to be because you were always meant to be that person. Be at peace, go in peace, and  be a peacemaker everywhere you go.
Good to see him back just because some he made some wrong decisions in his personal should not ruin his life p.s. omg fucking fantastic video
I think watching this video made me forgive him even more, i understand his journey and he understands his mistakes and I'm open to support him even if I can only comment on videos or like every video I can, hope he finds that him happiness inside and wish him great luck
Wish you the best in your life 🖤
Sorry about your grandmother, hope you be well, and congrats on working on yourself man. Everyone make mistakes, the solution is not to be define by them and try to be better enough not to make the same ones.
I’d like to make such a cool video like this but we hope to one day see that too
I'm here to say you deserve the second chance! The public may know what happened before. They may blame you for it, but i think those kind of things are not something that the public can judge you for. I don't condone you for cheating. Thats not it. I'm just saying there may be things that we, the public still don't know about the whole story. I like how you're able to comeback from that or at least how you're trying to recover from it. Keep doing what you're doing! Just like what you said on your video. Whats important is what you do after you fvck up! Come back strong man! I've always admired your talents! Hope to see more of you soon!
oh my gosh
Rip doughboy
You literally only came back because of your "so called career" and realized can't live without it lol
Not at these people under the comments justifying cheating and being a bunch of enablers 😭😭😭
A bunch of Albert stans are literally cheater apologists, he's reflecting on what? Doing something he's clearly aware of? 😭😭😭 BYEEE   It's really true that when someone is too happy, they take granted for it and ended up becoming selfish.
I missed you Albert! Welcome back!
All the comments are about the drama but can we just mention how damn high quality this video is.  I'm excited to see more content from this dude.
People make mistakes, and mistakes make you grow, so we all got to grow and forgive the mistakes people made, and what we made. Albert does not deserve what he is receiving,  I admit what he did was wrong, but that is not something we can all forget.
I know this is not really appropriate, but does anyone know the song that starts at 10:06 ?
Just put a music on then booom music video.
Being able to find personal happiness and fulfillment and doing what you love for yourself is very liberating, it's just hard to isolate it when we're constantly overwhelmed and stimulated. Fully agree on the whole making a career out of your passion statement, it only works if it's passion first and career second, otherwise it'll burn you out. Good luck, hoping to see more content from you.
Best apology video on YouTube
Welcome back, Albert!
This a really well done video i hope you have good redemption
OH SHIT HE BACK
Now this is an example of what mini ladd should do, but he did something way more fucked up than cheating * which is still bad, don't cheat * what mini ladd did, he should never come back, I think we can all agree. I've never been a fan of albert because I haven't seen his work with Lilly, but seeing this video is a nice start, I'll respect him for growing up and him seeing his mistakes.
Everyone deserves happiness. But I am not willing to support and forgive Albert yet... I need to see his actions in the coming months to see if his intent is true. Actions speak louder than words.
Why does this feel like some shit that would play before a movie in the theaters
Bro this is a masterpiece... my condolences but I couldn’t hold my tears. You’ve grown up.
wow. that was a really really well done video
Mahō wa inochi
as a media student i love this but i only really know albert for the bad hes done...i kinda hope to get to know this albert
If poki and fed didn't post the drama to the public, none of this would've been that big of a deal. Ok Albert fucked up but he shouldn't have been forced to make the whole situation go public and then ultimately cost him a year of grief.
Ooooh boy can't wait to hear this brand spankin new excuse from a sexual assult perpetrator!   EDIT!  I didn't know Fed and Albert were two different people. I started watching OTV when Micheal joined, and so I retroactively found out about all of that drama. I remember vaguely learning about Alberts cheating but it mostly took a backseat to Feds literal sexual assult, so it's entirely possible I conflated the two, I'm sorry, my mistake.
Really great video Albert! There are many things in this video I can relate to. Everyone makes poor choices and I'm glad you're working on bettering yourself. That's something everyone should do
this video made me cry. ive been down for a few years and im still in the place of trying to get back up. its so hard. i need to stop being so afraid thank you for the motivation. i hope you are feeling better and coming closer to being someone you can forgive
yo albert well no matter what people have told you everyone deserves a second chance and i may not know how tough it was for you but i am really happy to hear that you have improved so much and i honesly just wish all the best for you even tho you have prolly heard this before i am here to tell you once again ok we are all super proud of you <3
This made me cry...
Honestly glad to know that you’re handling life lessons well but truthfully when I see ur face I’m still reminded of you as a cheater. Though i’m not ur victim, i know and experienced being cheated on is a different kind of pain than what you’re going through. It was not pleasant to watch this vid thou it was well produced, will be avoiding and not be watching anymore in the future sadly.
damn dude it still is hard to forgive you but this vid really gave me the feels. Honestly really happy that your back man. The world really does need you.
Wtf is with the editing in this video? The entire Avengers: Endgame special effects budget in a 10 minute youtube video about nothing in particular.
Honestly, that was an awesome video
Everything aside this video in and of itself is extremely well made and thought out
sleightlymusical more like radiopharmaceutical
i nerver doubted about you. You made a mistake,yes, but it takes more strength and wisdom to rise again dispite all the critics you received. This video inspires me to overcome my problems and as someone said "The hardest part of ending is starting again"... and you made it. I believe that from now on, your life will be succesfull Albert. Wish the best.
Borrowing words from michael reeves:"Good luck buddyyy!!!"
I like the video, I'm glad and hope you will continue to better yourself.  Welcome back and good luck.
I always believe in giving people a chance to grow and learn from their mistakes. I went into this video neutral, a little mixed in the middle but I really like what you said at the end; that when your name is searched in the future, the results will be representative of the person you desire to become. It really has been a while, but welcome back Albert, here's to a better tomorrow.
I don't know why, but this video is so fucking good. What the fuck
That was bad ass
I just realized...Lily is still featured on his channel 😢
Good Editing
can we just appreciate how DARN GOOD THIS VIDEO LOOKS? I love the aesthetic of this whole video
Hello uhhhh I’m gonna disagree that people should give him “slack,” cuz you can’t control other people (of course I don’t agree with people harassing) people are still upset, even if lily has moved on (and good for her) and Albert is growing from his mistakes. Of course it’s not there apology to accept, but they have the right to be upset- but I hope no one is and if they don’t like Albert, they leave him alone for himself, which is what I’ll be doing after writing this. Anyways if you disagree let’s have a civil chat! I’m open to here about others stories or opinions (tho I might not reply-) anyways good bye this chapter! And good luck to you all, remember usually who you are in the past doesn’t define you.
Nice video!
this was a great video, really! every aspect of it from the story telling, cinematography, and the personal analysis. i think it can be very inspiring for other people. good luck on your missions and keep learning~
See, this is self-reflection. Looking back and trying to improve yourself.
hi albie, i really loved watching this. glad to see you're doing okay.
I'm happy he has reconnected with Kyle Landry and I'm happy Kyle Landry is there for him💚 I'm glad he has acknowledged his wrongs and that he is getting the help he needs. Lily has moved on and while I was initially angry and disappointed that he did that to her (I knew Albert before Lily), I'm just happy he is doing better and that Lily has moved on and happy herself with Michael😊
When I Found Out When Albert Do Something Bad To Lily That Make Her Hurt So bad,I was About To Cursed At You But You know What....You Mistake Just Bloom Into A Miracle....That Lily Just Found A Better Person At You And Not Holding Any grugde.....and i think every mistake doesnt end with lost road...its endless and has a lot of space that you can create from there.....dude keep you head up and keep living bro...dont let other tell you what to do and keep up with your work...dont give up and stay healthy!! From Your Truly fans
I already forgave Albert infact I didn't even care what happened but holy shit the video editing is slick as fuck
you're just human
Maaan I want Albert back streaming I fucking miss him so much this actually made me cryyyy
I’m glad both sides of the story have moved on. I don’t get why any of them (Lily and Albert) get the hate from this video. Yes what Albert did was horrible, he apologized, Lily forgave and moved on and is now better than ever. Albert is moving on and is finally continuing his life. None of them deserve the hate.
Albert, was always a big fan.  Whatever happened, all I want you to know is that I'm just happy you chose to keep on going.   Really nothing else I can say. Sincerely happy you carried on :)
This is the wrong video for me to get introduced to this channel YouTube.       Or is it....
Lily really thought she found the one that was for her. And this was a "mistake"? no. its a CHOICE. Already know they were dating then do this? How is that a "mistake"?
Yo what is the music at the end? That shit bops
You got this, hang in there
fine i'll resub. saw his stream, i really felt his remorse and he is sincere. he did not downplay the mistakes he made, but instead he decided to confront it as is
Everybody should forget for what he did, I know it's wrong but event lily already forgave him, and even found a new man, so let's just forgive him
We all fucked up but at the end, we just have to forgive ourselves, work on ourselves for the better
That's a very good trailer movie actually, it's well written and thoughtful, let's just all hope that you finish strong mate.
Beautiful keyboard by the way Albert. GMK Carbons on a RAMA m-60, you really have a good eye for a custom keyboard @ 0:17 and 11:05.  I wonder what switches you have underneath. Wonderful cinematography with a truck load of subtle references throughout your video. Scrolling through the comments, I can definitely see a small handful of people who are still holding grudges. It's unfortunate for them that they're unable to let go of the situation, even if they are not even involved, and are mere bystanders that are too involved into other people's dramas. I hope you all the best and it definitely seems like you are on the right path to changing into the person you aspire to become.
YEAST BOY YEAST BOY YEAST BOY I NEED STREAMS WITH YEAST BOY
Goosebumps
is that a gan cube i see??
"All I can do is work towards the day when ALBIE able to forgive myself"
Look what the internet community has come to.. a creator has to make a 11 min long video to apologize to his fans... I mean why do we care about the fuck ups of his personal like. everyone fucks up, why so much hate???   Just appreciate the man for the content he puts up. Why do the online community have to meddle in everything in a person's life that he has to go see a therapist. I get that he cheated and it's a bad thing but how does that affect the people watching him. why do we judge him for the mistakes he makes.. A million people might cheat everyday.. do u guys hate on them too.. do they lose their livelihood because of one mistake??  THINK ABOUT IT (ONLINE COMMUNITIES)...
Hope you feel better soon man. Life's been harsh for you, but we know you can get through it!
I don't wanna sound rude but what's the song at 5:10
i really wanna learn how to film and edit like that
ALBERT.... WHY DID YOU MAKE ME CRY..
Even if I didn’t think Albert should be forgiven, it’s not really my (our) grudge to hold.
At 4:04 is that GMK olivia? If it is I'm jealous. Also nice message, I enjoyed your video and the effort you put into it. You are very talented and the fact that Lily forgave you means no one should come after you as it is not their fucking life or their business. I'm glad that you making an effort to be better, which is the only thing we as people can do. I hope maybe in the future you and Lily can make another cover video together not as a couple, but as friends.
ok but can we talk about how amazingly this was shot and directed
Why does look like a movie teaser
why does nobody notice how well fucking made this video is? like seriously, its sooo damn good.
Hey, welcome back. Hope you doing well, man
Ill give you 1 like for that nice editing
Things happen for a reason, no matter what is whether it be your biggest mistake or your biggest achievement, whatever it is it’ll change you for the worse or for the better. But that choice is up for you to decide.
this is such a nice video
Hes back but dang the production is still high quality
Whether you like him or not, this is one of the best thought out, high quality and well executed video that I've seen.
Everyone change, I can tell that Albert did change. Please stop hating on him, everyone is not perfect, everyone can make mistake even if it can hurt someone, He know what he did and he fucked up he already suffered from it, Fresh start is always an Option and forgiveness is what accepts it. Please stop hating on Him
I feel like albert become more real, more earnest, and really growed from his experience, he's not asking for forgiveness but I'm really looking forward him coming back slowly and steady and stronger, his talent can't be ignored not his past wrong doing, but what make human the better or greatest is the growth in their individual as they struggle these things call life. Super Proud of him to become an individual and learn to still challenge the life he's living in while still growing strong, You may not be able to build the bridges you burn, But I'm sure many who are far away can wish and see you grow stronger as A Person, that why i never unsubscribed, KEEP IMPROVING IN LIFE AS THE BEST YOU CAN BE!!!!!
ok can i just say the quality of the video is amazing and this guy might fucked up but he's slowly being himself again and enjoying life
Damn albert is a talented boi ejcbshdsb :0
Warning: most of these comments are essays. Just watch the video and understand him.
I think its really good that he emphasized his goal is to seek self forgiveness. I’m glad that hes separating it from seeking forgiveness from others and that mentality will really leading him to seeking real change. Its not our place to forgive him. I wish him the best.
this instantly reminded me of otasaka from the anime Charlotte! but apart from that, this is one of the most real, and amazingly accurate videos I've seen in a while. I've gone through very, very, very similar things man, and i gotta tell you, i know the pain. i still haven't recovered from my mistakes and i still regret many choices, but you got this brother. we will all support you <3
Props to alebert
0:52 regardless of anything, the editing is really top notch in this. Also the directing, showing lily flowers here
The part about family hit so fucking close to home. I'm glad you're back. I'm glad you're working on you. Stay up, man. Rest easy Nai Nai.
Wellcommmeee back Albiee! ❤️❤️
this video is really good. It really shows how it took you a long time
He showed a picture of a lily when saying “the people closest to me”
Im glad that most of us do still grow from our mistakes and learn for the better! I wish you all the best Albert! Goodluck with your journey!
Wow .. you are promoting yourself and farming sympathy .. engaging audience emotions. All that you are good at either for being a sociopath or for being truly trying and a talented guy. Only time can tell. Lily has a big heart and she’s an angel .. she can’t hold grudge even if she tried. She cried to Dr. K and it still pains her. Cheating isn’t easy .. you cheated yourself but to the other person, it’s usually a trauma that requires time to heal. It’s a shock and for you, it was dirty, public and just something nasty! I hope you actually spent equal amount apologizing to Lily. This video took lots of planning, editing and work .. you knew what to say and how .. you made it emotional so people get touched and get fooled .. you could simply be just playing your cards right here.
Just here to support
welcome back Albert.
We forgive you :)
This is gonna get buried but the thing is, you made a mistake, you admitted it, and then you faded from your platform. You have recognized your mistake and have grown as a person because of it. Glad you're back doing content but it'll probably never go away.
Beautiful video! Truly connected to this, Thank you
What a beautiful video
this video is fucking beautiful man, you're very gifted. you certainly  learned your lesson from your past mistakes. i wish all the good things would come from this self-reflection. hang in there!
Glad to have you back and better buddy
yo Albert since nobody else seems to be commenting this, I want to let you know that this level of film production is drop-dead gorgeous. This video is a piece of art. Excellently well done my dude. I can tell how much effort you've put into refining this craft!
I'm glad ur back and that you wanting to change. Don't give up!!!!!!
I don't care about internet drama and who cheated on who. but this movie is a masterpiece and an inspiration for everyone who is isolating themselves with crippling depression.
So. He cheated yea. But he was never a bad person. Like he didn’t kick puppies or *gaslight all his friends making them turn on eachother and lowering their self esteem like a previous member of offline tv 👀. With the position he was in he problem had a bunch of girls trying to get him even though he was in a relationship should he have cheated? No. Is he an asshole for that? Yes. Do people literally cheat daily? Yes. He just did it in the public eye to someone people thought “didn’t deserve to be cheated on” but who does? People in college cheat on eachother like it’s a sport. He shouldn’t have had to go through all the shit he has.
welcome back albert-san
Holy damn. Good work, Albert.
Seeing Albert happy with Yeast boy really got me emotional I wish you a good adventure Albert <3
Honestly IMO, this is one of the greatest videos I've seen on Youtube.
I don't know if you'll ever read these Albert, but I just wanted to say thank you. You have been a big inspiration for me, and I'm really glad you're back. Everybody makes mistakes, but not everybody learns from them. I'm excited to see what you do next!
good luck on the road champ
It's time to join the real champions club and not the 'champions club ForsenCD' with a new beginning.
Personally I'm mad about the wasted egg...
Listen guys. Albert has paid his price, and he needs to be given some slack. Yes, the thing he did was terrible and indescribably awful. However, he owned up to his mistakes and made a serious apology (take notes, Logan Paul) which not many people are capable of doing. Lily is doing great after the drama and I hope Albert is, too. I wish you luck, Albert, in your journey back to happiness and I hope you're doing well.
First step.. Forgive Yourself
People fuck up, we accept the consequences, evolve and move on. Journey ahead.
i still like you bro
it's not my place to hold a grudge in lilys place; i think i speak for a lot of people when i say i will never support you but it's no one else's place to be mad at you besides for lily. i've never been and never will be fond of cheaters but I'm glad to see you took the time to yourself and have (hopefully) grown.
This is the good YouTube apology video. Not constantly saying sorry, but saying it once and talking more about your growth, even if everyone hates you for what you did. I think this man deserves more than just forgiveness, but our respect for coming out and really talking about his growth and how he plans to really better himself.
YOOO!! Sour Dough Breads are great!
guys don't say u forgive him. You don't know him nor did he physically affect your lives. He's updating you on the sit. He apologized for what he did and has probably apologized to Lily and Co. So just stop being so condescending. Spread some love <3
Im glad to have watched the video as I feel very similar towards everything you described, family, life, love, emotions, etc. They had been haunting me, all the crashes from the past behaviour, and the feeling of losing ur past self----which is pure and simple. I felt extremely lucky to be younger and going through the same 'rock bottoms' as you did, more lucky when I thihk of someone whos at it is making it out. Thank you for putting out such a great video, visually and emotionally. :)
Nicely made video. Lots of nice looking shots.
All drama aside, can we take time to appreciate how well made this video was?
Albert, for what you've done in the past year is the most deppresing thing, and i know that shit, You Are Cool!!... you are cool because you rised up even when you fucked up and the thing that i like to people is that, when people fucked up in something and they REGRET it, they know they did a bad thing, i believe them and forgive them as they are a nice person .So Albert, Welcome Back.
So nobody is going to say how f*cking good this video is ?
And this is why I don’t believe in cancel culture.
I'm curious to see what content you produce and how people will react to it. You are gonna have a high hater to fan ratio so I hope you are mentally and emotionally prepared for it.
Hey Its been a while
U deserve the hate and should really just go away. Using ur mental health as an excuse is just avoiding
no matter what happens each person is RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN LIFE if others hate you, who cares ... you are not to blame you did not do anything capable only to one person only one but you do not need to carry the excuses of others, im not ok with  the things you could or did but as I say EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS LIFE, I only know that I like your content and keep going FORWARD subscribe !! AND LIKE !!
As much I despised Albert for what he had done, I found myself in tears watching this video.  This is growth. Welcome back, Albert.
Yall can forgive Dr.Disresepct who was married and had a child
I’m so hyped for his come back
Albert, we love you man, just keep your head up, we will always love you and support you through your endeavors.
lily is happy, albert is getting there. wats the problem??
Lilypichu reacted to this.
People who disliked this video are worst than his past mistakes :(
Don’t hold a grudge for lily when she has already moved on guys. At the end of the day we’re not involved. Personally I support this return to YouTube because he seems to have done his absolute best to change 👍
I’ll always support him bro. I’ve been watching him since middle school, and he’s clearly learned from his mistakes
Dude, this video was like a slap in the face, I never realized the importance of empathy and to look at everything from multiple perspectives.
I do hope you do grow
Happy 4 u man
Neon genesis vibes
Still a fan, and ur videography is awesome. Support is still here
No one should do what you did, but it doesn't mean anyone should shame you for that. It's easier to blame some one for one mistake they did and critisise them, than look at the good things the person has done and say a good word. The only person who can say something about you is yourself. Most of the time people who critisise or hate someone have some problems them selfs, that they don't want to live with, and when they see them in someone else, they automaticly push them away. So Albert, if you can forgive yourself, everyone around you will do the same. I hope you get back on track better than ever, while having fun at the same time.
so fed return stream or nah?
video was heat
The man made yeast! He has my approval of forgiveness ❤
I just want to say, this is beautifully made and hits me in my Asian heart, especially the death of nai nai. I love my nai nai, she cared for me when I was young and my parents were working overseas, and pampered me to no end. People need to understand that no matter how much you messed up, you are still human. The mistake doesn't define you. The mistake is simply one factor in a person's life, but amplified to the nth degree by those around who define it as who you are. Life is more than about your mistakes, it's a guacamole of things. That's what makes life bitter, sweet, salty, sour and unami all at once
I subscribed because of this
This Video made me think...     ✨YOU'RE NOT ALONE✨
I swear some people just have noting to do with their life’s and are writing a whole essay for noting. Just wish Albert a good life or something, yet people still haven’t forgiven after a year it’s so pathetic what one mistake puts on people’s point of view.
hey glad to see you’ve been improving yourself. What’s happened in the past happened, and the important thing is to make up for it, improve yourself, and move on. No use to holding onto a grudge when everyone else has already moved on, you’ll just be killing yourself.
i forgive u and goodluck with the new life
I'm aware how it feels.  I know how it feels to be concieved a monster by the very same people you shared a piece of lifetime with.  I know how it feels to destroy everything you've built by making stupidly poor choices, as a backlash and punishment.  I know this, becouse I've been the same, if not worse. Your statement showed me to just move on. To force yourself outside the shell of complete exclusion, and stand on your own feet.  Now, I will follow the path you've shown me to change myself
Hm, so he always puts others need before his own happiness, yet still cheated?
🤔
Gosh, I cried halfway in the video till the end. Oh my...I didn't experience your exact situation, but I very well know That vehement feeling of loneliness, self-deprecating, self-hatred ... which I can't seem to convey it in words, as this hollow feeling is still perplexing for me, but I've fallen into such a burnout, cynical state, in which I just wanted to fade from people's memories and wait for the sunlight to carry me away. Anyways, I sympathise with this video, as I'm also trying to build and love myself :) , so I can love life , the people , and the world again. Sigh, This is quite a raw humane and very well-made video.  Thank you, Albert, and I hope u achive ur goals . Have a nice day !
You now I'm just going to say one thing what a fucking good video man and you always do great videos and this one is awesome. Just keep up like this video and the drama just what you said is enough for me to understand what you have been up to make yourself better person so.... man good luck and great video I hope you post more videos like this <3
Good job and welcome back, we hope to see how you develop in the future
Seems like he understood himself better now. All of us have no right to judge you. So as long as you have made yourself better, we should be supporting you.
THIS IS HOW YOU TAKE A HIT LIKE A MAN
I never skipped a moment in this film, it was all emotional and very educational. I myself have been struggling after being "canceled" or have reached an all time low. You made me realize a lot of things, your voice and story made me cry. I want you to know I look up to you for this, your dedication is breathtaking. Keep being yourself Albert, do what you love. Some people may be too conflicted to say it here but by making this film you have helped many of us by your words and experiences. I wish you the best, you have a wonderful life ahead of you.
Welcome back we missed u
Damn I remember toast talking about yeast
basically what he said about trying to escape reality through sleep, food, gaming, binge watching is my whole life as an introvert
welcome back
I see that you have Drunk Elephant products. Now I need you to drop your skincare routine 👀
yo this shit hits
the way of telling story and color grading are soooooo freaking dope tbh.
I'm so glad that internet exists.
This video is really fucking good
This is so well made!
At first, I was like "why make such an incredibly high quality video just as a pseudoapology/I-fucked-up statement?"  I watched this 3 times, and as a strong OTV & Friends fan who also ended up accidentally experiencing all of this, especially when my heart broke watching Lily on Dr.K's stream, I expected to continue to house resentment and anger for his dishonesty. But watching this and picking it apart, I can really feel the tremendous amount of sincerity he placed into the small, background details.  I watched his stream too, and I really felt that same sincerity there as well. I won't thank you for sharing this video, and I can't say I was ever much of a fan of you in the first place, but I do feel as though I could become a fan of the genuineness you're displaying here.  This video wasn't what I thought it was. I thought it was a showboaty bucket of skill that you placed into a video shallowly concerning the sensitive topic that you left on, but it's not. This is the most pure form of you, and I really wish you strength as you continue traveling your path of reflection. - From just a random person who feels they can trust the sincerity they see here
This is a step in the right direction!
honestly, can we all not talk about what albert did, and talk about what albert has just given us right now? this video has taught me so many things in just 11 minutes that i didn't know would ever be taught especially from a content creator that was deemed "cancelled" a long time ago. when i first saw this video, i was hesitant on clicking for only one reason and it was because "i shouldn't watch someone who's hated by many". but, to my surprise, this video warmed my heart.   this video taught me that there will always be someone for you no matter what you did, this video taught me that a person is defined by who they are and not what they did, and most importantly, i learned how important the smallest moments are in our everyday.   albert, i'm so proud of you. i hope you come back happy and content and i hope you come back strong.       sincerely, a fellow and passionate fan of music.
imagine losing everything in your life just for the nut      Ps: don't worry we forgive you
Goodluck Albert :) we look forward to hearing you play the violin again.
I had extreme anger on albert on what he did to lily but after watching this video I realized he also is a human and makes mistakes, the details he told on this video makes you wonder.
I watched this very seriously but fcking cracked up at 2:47   Then the seriousness continued.  I don't stand for what you did but I always stand for changing and better one's self  I hope you'll do well
this is such a beautiful video...thanks Albert
Gonna be blunt, I'm completely fine with Albert coming back... Dr. Disrespect cheated and he's still one of the biggest streamers on Twitch
whether you hate him or not, you gotta admit this is a really polished and introspective story of his life. good for him for working hard towards finding peace within himself, i hope he finds it someday
HE'S BACK
I'm just gonna forgive him.  Lily moved on and got a crackhead lover.  Albert is trying his best to change himself/get better.
Everybody makes mistakes more some than other some worse but who says you can’t have a second chance we give people many chances little or quite big so what’s the difference that he’s popular really people just want drama not peace we can’t just live in a world of peace because of these types of people but it doesn’t mean we don’t have to be like this he’s trying to change so why can’t we give him a second chance but to others we do??
God bless you, Albert! Praying for success in your endeavors! And I'm happy to know you've owned up and grown up after that situation. You inspire other depressed people to move on and move up.
We may all mess up sometimes, but as long as someone is willing to change, I’m sure they can at least become a better version of themselves. Cheers to you 🌻
You weren't cancelled, you literally just left. If you know a video like this is selfish even after already making an apology then why even make it in the first place?
ayy man.. it's good to see you back! gradually it will be okay bruv. Cheers have a nice day :D
Take that Albert ;-;
Im here because i like music and shit
Soooo.... When are we gonna see the same video but fed edition
i still don't know what happened, but truthfully speaking, that was a really well made video, the tempo, the visuals, the voice over, the music, everything.  As much as I want to know what happened, sometimes you just have to let other deal with it themselves, there are people out there that will still support you and what not, but being happy is not easy. I hope you get better, and you inspire me to want to be better and help myself more and do things for myself.
I think this deserves a resub
I'm proud of you.
Albie we forgive you welcome back!
just like fed, albert is another content creator i loved . mistake were made price has been paid, just that as a influencer it hits them harder. i will not judge at his past and look foraward to their future
Atleast Albert said he fucked up and now he's changing for the better. Everyone deserves a second chance even the worst people in the world and Albert isn't even the worst.
Well I don't care I'm just happy albert is back
I am happy for Albert even if he made mistakes. Everyone does and it is fine so nobody should be disrespecting him for one mistake he made. Just think how many did you make and how people still care about you
He doesn't need Lily's permission to return.
Glad to see you are back in your feet, keep up the amazing work man, you got this, never give up and keep walking straight
Mistakes are life's lessons and not a death sentence we carry every day.  Forgive yourself.
Forgiven but not forgotten. Welcome back, excited to see all the cool shit you're gonna do
damb, it'd be sick if more people made videos like this, and didn't freak out about a person trying to get back on their feet. Yeah, he fucked up, and broke the trust of many of his friends, which is never good, but its  really sickening to see how some people reacted, So what if he ended up hurting his friends, bu people need to learn to shut up.
Good Luck!!!! I hope you well in your career.
I can't express how happy i am to see you're slimming down is the fact that you're hitting the gym, relief <3 live in the present, for yourself <3
welcome back  i hope for you to comeback stronger
I'm so lost.. what happened??
Don't worry Albert. I believe that you have grown a lot and I hope you are doing better. I know Lily has forgiven you and moved on, and I will do the same. I hope you are doing better and I am looking forward to what will come. :)
People, please don't go hunting for blood, you can clearly tell that he regreted his decisions (look at his latest stream). Do you want him to write a back to back 10 page apology with his own blood?
Apology not accepted. Once a cheater, always a cheater.
Welcome back Albert!!!!!!
i can tell you are trying to get better. i think this is better than dropping off the face of the earth. i supported lily as a viewer and still do and i can tell from everything that has happened this year that she just wants the people who've wronged her to get better and seek help. youre a brave man. i hope to be able to search up your name one day and see things are changed. not forgotten but better.
I'm actually rooting for him cause I can tell his sorry and hes been through hell. Albert if you read this than I hope the best for you and your health (P.S sorry for your lost)
Your cool Albert. We always be here for you
I’m glad your back Albert ☺️
Hey, you did a really fucked thing, but I am really happy you are getting on the right path. Work hard and move through it and I believe you can do amazing things.
This is actually really well made
you¨re da maan albert, if you are fine that´s all
Im literally crying , i can't imagine how mean i was when all the otv shit happened , sorry , REALLY SORRY
The 6k dislike are probably from people who cannot let it go, no problem with that but it's just wasted energy, or people who didn't bother watching it fully.
This is a good story to tell :)
Mistakes do define you. And since the whole internet knows and can know about yours specially seeing that you are a bit of a public figure. I do hate you but that's me. Out side of that I hope you have learned from this. If you are actually getting professional help, congrats! Just like Moma RU says "don't fck it up", in your case, again. Good luck
This is a crazy good made video ablert, holy shit.
Impressive video, your skills are amazing.. I found the video to be also very inspiring.. so hey thx :D
This is how an apology video should be done. Not crying in front of a camera, not begging for forgiveness. Acceptance of mistake and asking if they are allowed to grow and move on. Well done albert I hope the best for you
hey whats music is in this video?
bruh people cheat all the time, yall really blew him up just to hate
i'm just happy you're back... because if you can do this, i can too. or something. idk. this video makes me feel better.
6:16 "I am an artist"... hell you are
Hi, good to see you back here. Hope everyone can move on with their own life. I can see myself enjoying your content though.
At some point I stopped cheking if you are back I thought it wouldnt happen and now im here watching this video glad that you are back ^^
Come one people the point of the video is to move on so just move the fuck on and either support or just don't send hate and ignore. Anyway the presentation here was really well done! Welcome back Albert!
Welcome Back.
All the drama aside, this is actually a well made video
Did this video made anyone else cry? Just me? Okay.
What got me was the part where he said he lost those closest to him and it was a picture of lilies
Well I know this isnt the point of the video but nice Nautiulus
ima be honest... yeast boy
Albert, I believe in you. Stay strong!
This is beautifull albert i know you fucked up but im sure you are a way better person rn keep improving....
Get well Alby Even when mistakes are made, as you said its what you do after think your life choices carefully next time WELCOME BACK!
Yoooo
Magic Man !!
Dude you made me cry.
It's feels so good to see people taking responsibility for their wrong doings. Lily is happy albert, so move on, find happiness :)
Good luck!
Cheating is scummy, and cheaters suck. However. It should never be a death sentence.  You are a really talented guy Albert. It really does seem like you thought a lot about this.  On top of that you legitimately took a year off of work to let others and yourself heal. Real talk 99.99999% of your haters wouldn't be willing to lose a single day of work. You literally put your money where your mouth was.  This my friend, is at the very least a start.   Welcome back Albi........... no, Albert Chang.
great video, looking forward to the future content.
never knew he could narrate why he cheated then change into a general subject like passion and hobbies
Should values teachers show this to their students .-.
doggo
Rip egg
This video looks like a movie and pretty damm good one.
This is so creative and touching 😭
This is so much better glad to see your ok, this was the best apology I've ever seen .
bro wtf are we hating albert bro people make mistake bro
Hope you are doing better mate. Best of luck
welcome back!! this is the best video i've ever seen ever
You made me look at my own life with this video and helped me realise that Im in that moment where im not happy my hobbies are my work now and I have to change something thanks Albert :)
What a great video man :’)
"No tea, just coffee"  I wish this guy happiness.
To those who still hated Albert, please... try to forgive him, i'm not trying to defend his choices. yes cheating is a bad thing to do, but trying to become a better person is something not everyone does when they make mistakes.
Well done, Albert.
Glad to finally see your doing okay bro I pray and wish you the best man. Keep your head high and keep pushing forward no matter what come your way. I'm rooting for you all the way :D
jokes aside the video editing and cinematics are masterpiece though. you could make a movie outta this, we humans always make mistakes right? keep up the good work!
Honestly, still kinda disappointed at what you did to Lily. But I’m glad you’re back. Lily forgave you already and is happy with Michael so there’s no reason to hate on you. It’s not my place to do so  Hope you and your girl are doing well if you two are still together   Goodluck on ur future endeavours
Regardless of what you are right now, this is probably one of the best videos I’ve seen on YouTube. Welcome back
Welcome back
nah fam.
Bro putting the past aside, this is some of the coolest cinematography ive seen in a while. I wish you the best of luck for the future and excited what you will come up next.
Humans are disgusting, going through these replies and seeing people still trying to hold him down when he's trying to grow and move on is so gross. If you don't like him why even bother coming just to spread more negativity instead of ignoring him and blocking and moving on?
A great apology video
How long did you take to make the video
YESS FINALLY YOU ARE BACK :)))
What impresses me the most about this—even more so than the quality of the video—is the level of self-reflection and honesty that he has taken on himself. I understand a lot of where he's coming from and the reason that he has now decided to talk to a therapist about his problems. The fact that he wanted people to like him and wanted validation from others but simultaneously had zero regard for the love he had for himself makes sense to me, and I don't think it's too hard after that to see how it could lead to him deciding to cheat even while knowing how wrong it is. Sometimes people chase the wrong ideals and suffer through them and end up letting the overwhelming pain get the better of them; sometimes it's hard to see what it is you're really doing to yourself. To be honest, the fact that he has realized this so well and has accepted it completely makes me respect him more than I respect most people that I ever see. This kind of self-honesty is hard and painful, but he may be handling this situation better than I have ever dealt with my own uncomfortable truths if I think about it. The people who make mistakes and know they are capable of them but still make the right choices afterwards have far more of my respect than the ones who think they are a good person because they've never done anything wrong and think they are incapable of doing anything wrong. Albert is a guy who has made a tragic mistake and understandably so, yet he has reflected on himself and is changing for the better. It can't get any better than that.  I don't even watch him, but I'm just impressed at what he's saying here. This is infinitely better than a simple apology; an apology was necessary, and everyone expected it, but changing for the better isn't necessary, and no one asked him to—if anything, some people basically tried to rip him apart. And yet, he's doing just that. I genuinely hope I can see this man smile again one day, and especially smile for himself.
We don't need to forgive but we also don't need to keep hating. He's already had enough criticism and Lily has moved on. Why do we need to keep hating on a person who seems like they genuinely want to change and better themself. Just move on and stop clinging onto something that's been done with.
Lily has moved on and living a nice and peaceful happy life so I hope you'll live a nice and peaceful happy life too, even tho there's still some people that can't move on about what happened just, ignore them I know you already accepted ur mistake so I hope people that hates you won't affect you that much, welcome back :3
We love uuuuu!!!!!!!
So cringe...
I forgive you  I hope everyone else can do the same
youtube recommending me dreamy night by Lily after this video is just fucked up man
People always acting like everything someone does is their own business. Leave the guy alone its been a whole year FFS xD
0:52 wow. i just love the details man. good luck!  kinda hope fed will do the same
I honestly don't have any single idea why are you cancelled but I've watched some of your videos before and this video's great, it's kind of inspirational.
One might not deserve forgiveness, but everyone deserves a shot of redemption.
welcome back <3
We are so happy for you albert... you are truly inspiring in a way
I can feel the sincerity. I really wish all the best to him. Welcome back :)
what happened is in the past now, both sides took their time to heal and improve from the situation, glad to see your back
I knew you weren't a bad person.
This video was really well-done to be honest.
this is pretty cool
welcome back dude, we forgave u
Welcome back Albert 😄, You sorry video was so good so much effort towards it. I know over the past few years you done some bad shit but the past is the past. I honestly feel sorry for what you going for but whatever happens, I hope you enjoy the rest of your life and I be here to support you, a viewer 🙃
E
lets all relax about what this guy did in the past, people can change
I'm not holding a grudge for something that didn't happen to me or concerns me However, I'm also not gonna continue watching, but I wish you good luck in the future man.
2:02 , literally the date when michael and lily dated       I wish you well very soon albert.
I am glad that you didn’t suicide.
Your records of your effort to change for yourself have really touched me, and I hope you will be able to focus and develop more things solely for the purpose of what you wanna do. Keep on creating, Albert!
Besides all the stuff you’ve done this video is really cool I’m excited to see what you do next
support given
No matter who people are just know he isn't the only one even we can do this. An innocent person can do a genocide. I forgive Albert since time has pass and he put effort in his apology, same for fed even if he did something horrible.
honestly, this is... amazing in production, in honesty, in everything. i care about the past, but man does time change some things. also you can’t deny, he had talent. this is one of the craziest arcs of ones life i’ve seen ever. i know i am one of the many anonymous and random voices on the internet. But i wish you the best Albert!
I cried, thanks.  :_)  Keep going strong Albie.
You've given hope for those wanting to seek out a better self and in that, I'm willing to follow this man's endeavours. Thank you for slowly finding yourself despite the incorrigible horrors that have induced and deduced your life whereas to go as far as to make you mentally and socially question your choices. Despite such horrors, you've come to try and give another shot at content creation, thank you for your resilience
I love that all of the comments I read so far is about forgiveness and move on and the video is so good..
The number of references to Lilly in this video seems to me as if it's his way of paying tribute to her, how she has influenced his life and how he will learn from his mistakes and become a better version of himself. I had no idea Albert was this talented with making videos and although he made his own poor choices I believe people should simply wish him the best, as like all people he is human and isn't faultless.
A+ video. Welcome back.
Good to see both people have moved on and decided to make new memories with family,friends and others. The viewers should let go of the past as well since both creators did.
Welcome back i hope :)
Amazinf video man best of luck 🙏🏽 I’m in the same position
You suck
Don't give a shit. You do you mate. Good luck
I've never been a fan of you for the simple reason that i found out about you after the whole drama and obviously what i heard about you was'nt the greatest, but even tho i didnt know you has a content creator nor a person i hope the best for you and im very proud to see you reaching for a point where you'll be happy to be. I'm looking forward to you becoming a better person and also, this was a very good and inspireing video.
Why am i crying😭
There’s one thing that pisses me off about this video, that form on the ergo meter was so poor it’s actually harmful I couldn’t stand it.
This is so well made and I'm glad that you strive to improve yourself as a person by reflecting and acting upon your mistakes.
im just here to see the perspective of someone coming back interesting
this was so good from albert this experience actually made him realize so much more congrats man
he got this
prioritize yourself make yourself happy man
Coop dude, 5 stars
Setbacks are what they are. But they also prove that you can move. I hope you continue to make those gains and not lose yourself in the process. Good luck out there.
Mistakes happen.  Fix yourself and come back stronger and better.
I am so proud of you.
Welcome back Albert. We missed  you.
Stay Strong! Glad you're back Albert!
10:21 He's producing music.. on the left screen it's omnisphere ( a plug-in mostly used to make atmospherical pad/bell type sounds) on right screen he has logic x ( a digital audio workstation)
It's so weird seeing this after being gone for so long.
This is beautiful Albert, Love you buddy. I'm really glad you're doing good, you're a great inspiration.
Hello Albert. Welcome back.
this video is the embodiment of im 14 and this is deep
ok its time for Fed to comeback
Every scene was meticulous and thought out. Love the cinematography. Mistakes do not define a person. Bounce back strong 💪💪💪
This reminds me of Tommy Trinh's from JK Films video on his second collab channel Formula Arts, called Dear Thomas. Also,  are you turning into Sojiro from Persona 5? Making coffee, getting active and social
Damn....that was literally my reaction at the end of the video but Albert can Loki no more like hike make a movie
Shieeee
Shxt. Now this is one helluva standard for an apology video. Srsly doe, Hope you're doing well and doing better.
i know what he did was bad and of course you can't just ignore the fact that he did what he did but im really glad he made it through it. The internet can be a really rough place especially if you do something bad, its so easy for people to say terrible things normally but then everyone jumping in on it because they assume its morally justified that it can really take a toll on someones mental health. But from now on i home that Albert can try and make good from the bottom up and somewhat redeem what hes done.
Yayy he's back
I'm just now finding out about this surprisingly and I'm glad it's not being commodified as much as it has the potential to. People are bigger than their mistakes and while I was disappointed to find out what happened, I never thought that made you a bad person. I am glad that you took the time to work on yourself, to think deeply and to create something meaningful. In a way, this brief look into your life over the last 12 months felt more intimate than watching clips from your life nearly every day - you have the ability to connect while holding things back. I hope you are able to keep that up, it's hard to find a balance. I may never be a regular viewer of yours (to be completely honest, I never was) but you are talented and you have merit and value. And I sincerely hope that this leg of your career is filled with healthy authenticity leans more into your passions and less into people pleasing. Be well!
i actually cried
Welcome back Albert
love you my homie
Although I have no personal intention of supporting your work, I would like you to know that the path you have chosen to use in moving forward from what happened is a good one. If nothing else, it’s at least your best option. I will not be extending my forgiveness, because ultimately, my forgiveness does not matter in this situation. I hope that you, those around you, those you will meet in the future, and those you will never see again find what you all need in life, whether that be forgiveness, self-fulfillment, redemption, happiness, or whatever else.   Males in the US typically live to be in their late 70s. Given that you’re only now about to turn 30, I think you’ve got time to figure everything out. For my part, I think you’ve got a pretty good chance.
Good job on recognizing your mistake and improving yourself. What you did, yes was wrong. But you going out there, improving yourself, and overally overcoming your flaws for yourself AND others. I'm really proud, not many can step up and fix the wrongdoings. I hope people will forgive you for what you did, instead of sitting on their asses. Too weak to fix their own flaws. And while this isn't the best place to say this probably, I hope the same happens for fed :)
Well done, bud. I’m sure they accept your apology, they probably did before you even had to say it.
glad you're working on yourself albert. i'm genuinely happy for you, and please keep going <3.
Hey albert I know you messed up but that's what makes us human, what makes us special is our ability to come back, so we are here for you
we love you <3
The word they used to describe you back then was "sociopathic". Honestly? Good on you for working on yourself. Good on you for leaving for a year. Good on you for this well-planned well-made narrative. Many will forgive you, forget what you did.   But the rest of us? We remember, the word they used to describe you was "sociopathic".
nice video but now show everyone what you got.
That was both inspiring and truly honest, thanks for sharing. Maybe the Yes Theory philosophy will motivate you further, it certainly did for me, just search for these guys.
Cheating wasn't okay, yeah. I'm sure everyone knew that. So what's the point of saying it over and over again? I won't say cheating on someone is a "mistake" in life, but this video proved to us that he has moved on. It is perfectly fine to have your dislikes with people, but if you still want Albert to have his entire life ruined, maybe to go drown in alcohol and waste himself away (even after a year of probably, endless hate and death threats), you're terribly worse than the scale of drama Albert went through with the internet. I'm glad that he acknowledges working towards forgiving himself and that the future can be changed although the past can't.
I've been waiting for your return for a long long time. You are a great artist a special violinist. May you gain that strength to create even more awesome content. I'll be cheering!
Albert i hope you find success and forgiveness in the future because in my eyes you recognized and admitted your faults and seem to be working to be an all around better version of yourself and I have been in that situation where we can so easily blame others and say well they just don't get me but as people were revolving doors not regular ones that are fixed on a set path but an ever revolving and evolving one so I hope you find peace and happiness with your new outlook on life, and my deepest condolences 🙏 on your loss may you achieve to be the person your grandmother saw you as. I hope my favorite quote from Robin williams will share something with you "“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy, because they know what it's like to feel absolutely worthless and they don't want anyone else to feel like that."
Damn, that was so beautiful.
Let us become great together
This video is beautiful, through its message and the production itself. Welcome back Albert.
Omega lol
Keeping the whole otv thing Aside.  Storytelling Editing Narration are pretty darn Epic 🔥
AYO ALBERT YOU MY NEW FAVOURITE PERSON ONLINE FROM NOW ON LOL I LOVED LILY BUT I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE
I missed your content, Albert. And Im glad you coming back now ^^
I support you albert! No one should be judged for his past mistakes! Many of us believe in you making a change!
I believe he disserves a second chance. This is the real world, people grow from their mistakes, sorry cancel culture.
Look, it's pretty obvious that Albert knows that he messed up, and Lily has already moved on. This apology is clearly made with at least some truth behind it, so lets all try to forgive Albert for what he's done. Just imagine if you were on the internet your whole life and suddenly it all just turns on you for some reason, how isolating it would feel. I get that what Albert did was wrong, but both sides have agreed to move on, and so should everyone else.
It is a great video. I like both editing and narration. I am looking forwards to your improvements. But as many people said here, we can forgive but not forget. But I am sincerely believe you are working on yourself to be a better man. Good luck man.
Good people do bad things sometimes. It’s ok i still like u.
I would love to see you talk to Lily again
Tbh i think you were a great guy and still do ik u did something that alot of people couldnt forgive but im glad ur okay and what are u not good at u just made a k drama episode but overall im glad ur okay
Welcome Back :) Growth Mindset is a brilliant thing. Many people would not be able to reflect this deeply and have the courage to come back to something that could be extremely uncomfortable; this is really admirable. Well done Albert!
wish u the best
Honestly one of the video ever realised
Fair enough, you fucked up. You said it yourself and admitted to it, you owned your mistakes and you are also having help. Rebuilding oneself will take time, energy and a lot of patience for all those that you have hurt before.  But sure.  I will give it a try again. None of us a perfect and we all believe that we will always make the right decision under any circumstances. Only those who have walked some darker paths will know how wrong that statement is.
Happy to see you back!
I forgive you and I think lily too but forgive is a strong word for her but I think she moved on with it
side note from his return but his film-making skills are incredible.
albert really is a great person and even great people screw up but albert did the right thing and im happy to have him back. stay strong, stay safe, you still have fans out here.
I MISSED YOU
U deserve second chance  Can't wait for ur new content :D
Yall see the street sign that said liberty?
Amidst all this #MeToo, Streamers and Youtubers fuck ups, harassments and so on, with all of them using the "I'm gonna take some time off Social Media, and self reflect." - This guy here, seems to be the only one (so far) to have ACTUALLY done this. To actually have sought out help to better himself. I had no idea who he was before all the drama, but he has certainly done what he could and continues to do so (it seems), in order to "get better" for lack of a better saying.  Good for you Albert! This is what it means to take time off to self reflect.
Well done Albert, I support you all the way, hopefully this journey has helped you start over. It’s okay to have fucked up, it’s part of the journey, as long as it made you change yourself then you can always stand back up and start again, hope you’re doing well man ☺️
*Ah yes, the perfect pets are the ones that you can eat*
So there are 5.8k people who haven't made mistakes!!
This is such a wholesome video. Loved it.
Welcome back mate. It's nice to see you again
Al I found out is that he uses FL Studio
Now we just need fed to get over his regret and im happy, btw just be urself boys r shitty in the end but we play cry and learn
i got so emotional because of this video,you threw your life in a dumpster but im happy you genuinely realize your mistakes.this year has made you into a wiser man,good luck!
So, I was a fan of Albert long before he ever joined OTV. And it was because of his magic since when I first found his channel, I was very into magic. After I left magic behind, I subsequently left Albert behind and have only recently found out that he joined OTV years ago and left last year because of the situation that happened. I'm not saying that what he did was right because it wasn't. But jeez, it's not like he committed fraud or held someone up at gunpoint. I feel like being a "influencer" really maximizes any situation 10 times more than if it was just an average person. Cheating happens a lot, but average people don't get vilified by the internet because of it. Like seriously, didn't him and Sarah get death threats or something? Lily moved on and forgave him, and although what he did wasn't right, it doesn't warrant threats, it doesn't warrant the end of his career, and it definitely shouldn't stop him from a second chance at YouTube, Twitch, etc.
Technically it's that girls vote not Albert's or Lily's that girl was the one who supposed to be blamed
Albert, im glad you've grown or matured, i hope you can keep this up dude!
Good to see u back m8
Actually a fantastic film video . Editing and storytelling was superb.  Wish you the best
I have always acknowledged the fact that you fucked up, but for some reason I never could bring myself to hate you. Seeing this video made me like you more actually, I'm not saying that what you did was good with the excuse that it made you a better person, however, I couldn't be happier to see that you're doing better.
This is objectively a great video, good job Albert 👏
I came into the story quite late, only few months ago in fact. However I do see this video as a very sincere apology and a way to start fresh, I very much enjoy the format it is being told, it is real, cinematic and well put. I hope I can see more videos with this format from you, it certainly has the potential to grow as a different path.
I think he learned the working out when depressed tip from Michael, which I hope we can see them both hanging out again. Even if they switched roles, they were still good friends that cared for each other, Lily, and everyone else in their friend group
who is this albert chang guy and why tf is he in my recomended
Nice albert goodluck finding ur true ways of live
Tokyo Fckn Ghoul 5:15
It's a no from me dawg
I'm now your fan. Great video
Am i the only one fucking crying while watching it.This is the most emotional video I've ever watch on yt
This makes me want to make a video like this. Over the past year I’ve been working through a lot of emotions, just emotions that stem from facets of my life I’ve never really been okay with sharing. I’ve always been someone who wants people to know me better but I’m too scared to let people drown in the depths of me. I’m scared of showing everyone who I am because I’ve never shown anyone who I am. I’ve never really taken the full small step for myself and never had the guts to take the leap for mankind. Idk. Just getting stuff off my chest and this video is inspiring. It makes me want to let everything pour out of me.
I'm proud of you! Welcome back Albert!
Well everyone deserves a second a 2nd chance as long as they learn there lessons from what they did, and lily happy with another person so no more grudges hold and the people that are still holding it is stuck in the past or just Albert haters before the drama started
Genuine and mature. Thank you for sharing and I wish you the best on your journey of healing and growth.
Glad you're working on being happier, all the tough times will pass, and there will be more. But stay strong, and like what they say, "make yourself happy before making others happy"
I never was into your content, but I'm glad to see you back and well. Keep improving!
I don't know what you did wrong but this video was inspirational
This is one of the best videos I have seen in my life
He's learning from his mistakes and we should learn how to forgive.
I love sci fi movies
I'm glad to say i never had any grudge or hate against Albert bcuz unlike most people, i understand what a mistake is and we all know how good of a guy Albert is. Welcome back Albie, we've missed you.
He keeps saying he was cancelled, but he cancelled himself. This whole vid is just asking for pity “omg I pleased people and it hurt me. My nana died and she was important to me!”
I'm sorry about what happened with you're family but I think you're making amazing progress I wasn't commented to your content before but I'll try now
Hey albert! I been watching OTV since 2018 but when i heard you cheated on lily i got mad but i thought that you already have enough problem so i pray that you got better as a person and i think god answer my prayer greatly and you got better , i still think what you did is EXTREMELY BAD but i forgive you and I don't want to be like other who leave hate comment and be toxic and i happy ur back
almost cried
waiting for fed now
This is better then the 30 minute no editing "I fucked up" rant apologies  made by other YouTuber's.
Welcome back man... We missed you alot... Look like you doing fine... I always love your video man... Its different than others. I know life was tough but i believe you can cope with it. Hope to see more contents in the future
Humans learn from mistake, it’s what makes you stronger; Keep working on you Albert.
Okay, but can we take a minute to appreciate how well made this video is?  Also the grandmother story really hit close to home. My own hasn't passed but did have a big health scare in May and is likewise super worried about me out of love and I try my best to not seem like a fuck-up towards her. I'm hoping I actually won't be the next time I can see her after the pandemic.
No words.
This video is a work of art
Good to see you again, healthy first and foremost! Anything you’ll do in the future will be horrible for some parts. But it was your fault and I hope you can just ignore it. I’d be really happy if you would be coming back! Have a nice day, Albert!
Okay I’m sorry for bringing her up in here but when Lily said she knows everyone doesn’t deserve hate its true because this person will learn to live up to this persons mistake and thats amazing thats why I believe her I too think the same way.
We missed you, violin boy. You've been through a lot, and I'm glad to see you come out stronger and better than you were before.   Welcome back.
It will be beautiful if OTV watched this together
This video was great. Very very well done. High quality and veey personal. You were very brave on making it. "Changing is a life time process". Become the person you want to be. You are on the right path now. Look up to.the future and be responsible. Find the happiness you're looking for. I wish you the best of luck.
Everyone deserves a second chance
Took you long enough, glad you're back Albert!
hey bro, let this comment section be your supprt as well is u ever look back on this video like  said as a posted note for when u fucked up, there will always be a comminity backing up your process to be the best you, it takes balls to admit they were in the wrong, u did it before u left the world and self isolated, in a way you have already taken a bigass step to being the best YOU, YOu can be, and honestly i have mad respect for you, the gist of this journy youre on is all in this video, and being the one willing to change who he was is outstanding and i cant wait to see what new content your gonna give us and the futur of ALBERT CHANG. (also sorry for your loss, prayers for her and your family a nd you albert) keep your head up and whoop tomorrows ass. and for everyone else, please learn from this video alone and as an eye opener, there will always be hope for someone to change and better themselves we just need to look at tomorrow and finally do it, there will always be real people willing to dig you out of that whole you got in, so cmon, let's all grab some shovels, and lets help one another be more like albert to better ourseves for tomorrow, even if it's little thank you Albert, stay strong man and keep your head up and welcome back brotha :)))))))))))
AYO ALBERTS BACK
Stop ;-; i don't wanna cry anymore ;-;
This video is incredible, you're really talented. I hope you find happiness and become the best version of yourself 💖
There's something good about hitting rock-bottom, you don't have any other way but to go up am i right ma boi buster moon
2:00 ElonMusk21 lmaooo
What a comeback!!! Good luck restarting.
I enjoyed the video, it was well thought out and i know it must have taken forever to develop and make it, good luck on becoming what you want to be! And rest in peace to your grandmother <3
this is actually a work of art
My condolences bro.
fed ur turn.
people aren't just good are bad, they're just people made up of the good things and shitty things they've done. (Bojack Horseman)
great video albert. lots of respect for turning a new page in life. never forget yourself and keep your head up :) RIP nainai
These mf comments are long 😂😂😂
I understand how inconsiderate and selfish your actions were. However you and everyone else on this planet was born to make mistakes and be selfish. The fact that you’ve come from your hole and came forward with this video proves a lot, especially since everything you did was practically being watched over by millions. Only you know what your true intentions are, but at least you weren’t a pussy enough to just disappear forever and for that I congratulate you
We forgive you.
I’m glad you’re back. This was well made. :)
I get that was a I'm changing video I'm I hope you can see that and forgive me but DANG that was some good editing
I think this is way better then some half-assed apology most YouTubers give. Im happy youre taking care of yourself and i wish you the best of luck on your journey. Just know that yes, you made a mistake but youre learning from it and that means a lot. Im really, truly happy that youre mental health is improving. Just know that there are many people out there who love you and support you <3
People make mistakes, it's normal! Honestly, they'll people still hating you for it but who gives, at least you found your passion and love for content creation.
This... is very similar to how/what I'm doing right now. (except for the fact that I didn't get cancelled by others, basically myself) I hope you'll come back stronger than ever <3
7:39, he runs across Liberty Hill, I wonder if that was intentional
this video.. was surprisingly one of the best things ive watched in awhile.
Believe it or not, you are an inspiration to many, many people. This video fills me with joy as it makes me realize that there are people who build up to a better life and mindset after making a mistake, especially when the toxicity of cancel culture is absolutely infuriating and dangerous to one's mental health. Welcome back, Albert!
Good to see you're back. 🙂
what’s with this like to dislike ratio, I wanna know the people who disliked reasonings
AlbertCD
This video is at least the most badass insane piece of cinematography I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time. A amazing piece of work, I’m excited to see what will come in the future for Albert!
ok this shit is really well shot
That ending quote was beautiful and deep
This the greatest video recommendation YouTube has given me
I love you, you are so talented.
you did good albert, welcome back
7:11 liberty hill
Man come on.. You could've made the end exponetionally better by writing "Albert Chang-ed".. I'm dissapointed. Jokes and great criticism aside, I really believe you and believe in you to change/or have changed. I will happily give you my second chance. :)
Keep fighting on
Hey can someone tell me the soundtrack for background?
I am happy you are here today.
So right, everyone will make mistakes in life, and how you learn from them and grow as a person can be very telling. Glad you're seeing a therapist and glad to hear that you're taking care of yourself too.
If you have didnt cheat on lily youve never be Here now. :/
dude these shots are awesome like this was a lot of effort also welcome back! hoping for some cool new content to watch
I'm not trying to hate, but I couldn't help but think him saying he had trouble saying "no" was him trying to explain why he cheated.
You got it all man i belive in you.
Actual banger video
forsenCD Clap
When are you going to collaborate with FED?
now it’s feds turn to make one
Yeaa im down with this kinda editing. Its PogU
Everyone is such a bandwagon😂
regardless of everything, the production value of this video is redic
i bet he wrote the script for this video on a google doc LOL
This was really insightful. Glad you're puttin in the work to better yourself. I'm certainly not the best person and I don't think you're the worst for your mistakes. Thanks Albert
What everyone knows: CHEATERS SUCK.  But only a few that have made the mistake of cheating on their significant other will take the time to reflect on their actions, become a better person, and overall seek the help they need. It's not anyone's place to give and accept forgiveness except for the parties involved. Albert did what MANY cheaters out there should do after making their mistake. It takes breaking down your ego and accepting change to do what Albert did the past year after the incident. Both parties have stated that they moved on and opening wounds to please your curiosity and drama-loving brains are not their job and you're just hindering their healing and how much they have grown past this. All Albert wants is a new chapter and he's shown through his actions that he is ready for it.
What Albert did was scummy, and he dealt with it right away pretty poorly. This Albert is... pretty edgy LMAO but I think showing off more of who he really is will be interesting. Hearing him speak his process of getting through this was great.  'Learning to live for yourself' YES this is so hard when you're so used to being around others. I've struggled with it a lot and was a bigggg reason why I was unhappy all the time.  Take care. I do find it hard to watch old OTV videos, but hope I can keep watching your  new more personal content.
Being young and making mistakes is a right of passage. Good luck in maintaining that resolve and walking down your new path.
I like the video :) Thankyou for sharing
tbh I'm really proud of him
Welcome back <3
i've recently started watching OTV, and when i learned about what happened, i immediately felt spite towards you. this video reminded me that you're just a person. it's easy to write people off as good or bad, but ik how shitty life can get and how far from ourselves we can stray. i really enjoyed watching this video, it's obvious you put a lot of thought and care into it. i hope the best for you and your channel.
Good video. It's very well edited and filmed. Atleast you recognize yourself and i hope people don't hold grudge against you. It's nice to see that you change. Like you promised.
Hi Albert. Great video!
This was really inspiring. I'm looking forward to the new you <3
Oof. This videoclip is Good.
This is beautiful. You are an artist, and you inspire many of us.
honestly, at first, i was skeptical in watching this video. maybe i was holding some sort of grudge, one that was not for me, a viewer, to hold. but i'm super glad i clicked on this video. i can clearly see that you've been going through a ton of shit, and you deserve that second chance, the third chance, and however many more it takes because it shows that you truly recognized your actions and are taking the steps to do better, and be better. of course i do not agree with people excusing actions as "human mistakes", but what you are doing is not excusing your actions, it's explaining, recognizing, and repenting.  i resonated with your message you have put out. thank you for putting this out, and i truly hope that you're indeed doing well.  and? i'm insanely glad that when i search your name, it's just you.  congratulations on your growth. it's a tough mountain to climb, but you did it, absolutely. there's more to come, i'm sure, but when it does, i'm sure you'll do amazing. best of luck, albert.
From a filming point of view, it’s a really good piece of work. It’s nice to see someone on YouTube actually get to the point and acknowledge their mistakes in a video. Good job, keep doing what you’re doing.
Glad to see you back and strong💪
Hate him or not but you have to admit          This is a danm good film
I cried at the end fuck
"There as none so blind as those who refuse to see." If people can't see that Albert is truly sorry, then I am sorry for the hate comments but the fact this isn't a fake "im sorry" video like 90% of the platform does when something like this happens and he's taking responsibility is a big thing. Good on you bruv
So I never really knew much about him except for snippets of covers, but when I heard about him and Lily, I was surprised since I never had a negative opinion about him. Probably since I’m not much of an empathetic person, I was like “Huh, that happened.” I couldn’t say for sure he was the worst person in recent memory, but it was for sure a terribly thought out idea. They do say that communication is key, whether it’s between two people or yourself.  Recently, I saw headline about this video and was surprised since I honestly thought “this soon?” but that’s just me forgetting how long a year is as a month is already quite long enough for change. I ignored this since I just thought it was, “well, okay, now I know that” but a video recommended to me was about XQC reacting toward this about it being overproduced. I ignored that because I was like, “that’s a bad sign” but then when I finally sat down to watch this video, I couldn’t agree with him.  I think producing this helps it in making a message and thinking about what he wanted to say and what he wanted to think. I do this often, thinking about myself, who I am, and the people I’m with, or even concepts unrelated to me. Kind of like writing an essay, I think the production leads to a format that he wanted to bring forth to the table. Like he said, it seems to be a message for himself rather than others. I can’t say that he’s not a power-hungry selfish sociopath looking for social pleasure or gain, but I do trust that he spent a year trying to improve himself. Not for any particular reason, but just because of being human.  Like what other commenters said, being human is making mistakes, owning up to them, and striving to be better (or at least remember to never do them again). Although I probably won’t check up often what he’s doing, it’s something I’m curious about. From what I’ve watched (though that doesn’t mean much), he’s not in a weird grey area like Fed was, where he had slip ups and seemed a bit off multiple times, but seemed to have made a terrible mistake. Surprised excuses weren’t given, but I can see that as mature. Anyway, I hope the best for him.
hope everything workout for you man, truly, best of luck (and great video btw)
All I have to say is that this is a very good video in terms of production quality.
I started crying watching this.
I hope he heals and resolves all of his problems, wish him the best, we all make really bad decisions in our lives at some point, he will overcome this.
I'm glad you're doing better now, and I hope you'll stay happy. Take care and as difficult as it sounds, try not to be too harsh on yourself, focus on the people that care and support you. I wish you good luck on whatever you're doing in the future!
what's the song that plays at the end
I got to say i forgive him and first of all lily is now living a happy life with micheal also hes trying just live a life  man so stop attacking him for what he did try forgiving
<3
yes some may say this video is self indulgent, but why do ppl expect him to talk abt the cheating situation more? No lifers concerned more with someone elses life because their life is so empty, how about instead of looking for someone to look down on just focus on urself, he said at the start he didn't want to talk about things that is so private and he doesn't want to feed the audience with drama. People need to stop acting like this was meant to be anything of an apology.
i cant support you
I hope that other OTV fans specifically the fans of lilypichu will forgive him
People make mistakes. Nobody is perfect. Forgiving yourself and looking after yourself is the best thing you can do.
you betrayed that Yeast like you betrayed lily LMAOOOOOOOO
The video is really awesome, i liked the story driven aspect, well knowing that it is your story. I am impressed that you are taking your life in such a positive direction and hope you'll reach your goals without being lead astray again. I do believe change can happen if you truly want it and work for it. Im trying to change many things in my life as well and i really found this motivational in a way. We all make mistakes and hurt others, i guess its part of life too. So i hope you can really move on and not forget the things that happened, but remember them as they are part of your life, just as all the positive things. As long as you can forgive yourself and find peace for your own sake, while acknowledging the consequences itll all be good. I look forward to see what youll come up with.
Waiting for the redemption arc .
You do you man. Good luck!
Hey man I just want to say I wish you all the best for your career. I have no tolerance for the actions you comitted, but the amount of hate and emotional baggage you experienced must've really taken a toll (deserved or not). However, I truly hope you grew as a person and I'm looking forward to what you have in store! Good luck dude, this isn't going to be easy.
Where did he show lilies? Dont think the one at 10:45 were lilies..
Cuando haras stream en Twitch?   ya paso mas de una semana.
It’s a good video!
This guy could make a movie. Shits like the narrated scene before the title card.
This video is so great. Take care of yourself man, I hope you're doing good
i forgive you if anybody deserves forgiveness  its Albert chang  welcome back and i wish you the best of luck through coming back as i will be with you every step of the way
This was such a good video😭😭
Bro Stand up!
Wasn't a viewer before this one only vaguely saw Albert on OfflineTV, but seeing so much heart put into a video about working to being a better person. Makes me wanna join this journey.
Could someone tell me the name of the sweater at @2:26 and the jacket at @9:16 ?
You can move on forget about the past think about the future
I want to forgive him but it's not like it was a one time spur of the moment kind of cheating, it was planned and they were careful to not get caught. I mean they were using google docs to talk to each other and not get caught.
Kekw
Didnt even know what you did, but some1 said the video was fire, not dissapointed <3
I’m actually proud of the work you’ve put in yourself... good video
Albert learned and took time like almost a year unlike the other one who thinks one week off of YouTube means he’s A-okay
Welcome back Albert I hope you are well. I’m still a little pissed off at you but the main thing is that u have learned. I wish u all the best returning to the content creation world. It may cause you more pain and a bigger burden than now. Please be happy.
I forgave him as soon as I heard about what happened months ago, Humans make mistakes. Albert I'm glad you're doing better, Stay strong!
lol so calculated. social media 2020
I loved everything about this. I love seeing people grow and change over time. It's like watching flowers bloom in time lapse and seeing how they move and aim higher than where they once were. Thank you and welcome back!
Im glad you're doing okay Albert, I never held a grudge against you but I am really glad you genuinely and sincerely apologized and work on yourself, I hope you are able to become that person you straight to be one day.
Glad to hear that you’ve been using your mistakes to not turn yourself down but to make you work on making yourself a better person.
wait pls dont say that u got with friends who will be with u no matter what because the friends u lost would have been there for u no matter what but they dont because u made them cheated on them
cheating is not right and it will never be
I'll never forgive someone for doing what you did, but I also believe people deserve a second chance and that people can grow and change and learn from mistakes. I also don't hold grudges. So Godspeed Albert. When you start posting again, I'll be there.
This was actually a really good video! You seem to be better now
This video is truly inspiring and very well made
Sincere
Hi Albert, please whatever you do. DO NOT REPLY TO MESSAGE FROM LILY. It's time to move on. We all fucked up in life, it's important to learn to close the page and move on. You are not that guy for her. DON"T BE THAT GUY.
best apology video 10/10
Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experience. I'm glad you're on your way in finding happiness; wishing you all the best into being the person you want to become. <3
im happy your back man
This is one of the best videos and sense of storytelling I have ever seen. We love you.
this took such an incredible amount of courage to post, and I really respect that albert, glad to see you're back, and I'm working on loving myself as well! let's get through things together
Albert you did some stuff that people will  not forgive you but i do and I know you can do better
I'm still a new viewer but I always enjoyed how hard Albert worked on making his streams look so nice. I have no idea what happened when I saw Lily with another person but I'm glad that things are looking up for you Albert. I don't know what happened in the past but hopefully your future will look bright. Not sure what else to say, but just live your life my dude. Enjoy everything and everyone in it.
Holy fuck dude. This was a very well made video. To make mistakes is to be human. As you said, what matters is what you do afterwards. I'll be looking for your content in the future. Good luck
welcome back, albert.
Hey man, welcome back. Some people won't forgive you for what you have done, but you should know lily and us will happy to see you doing better
what is this a essay comments????!!?!?!?!? Aside from this comment At least Albert is doing better now.
It’s okay, destroy your grudges, he is now a better person. People make mistakes, not everything bad is a mistake but there are worst things in the world. FED’s violation isn’t something that may never be forgiven, but Albert’s can. Stay safe, be kind, and have a great day!
dawg you dont know how much i fucking miss you.
Cancel Culture is scary.
Albie I want you to understand that video isn't just for you as there are things in here that i can relate too and understandably learn from and i hope you get better enough to the point were you can at least bring some of your talent to youtube every few months
God, i was hoping for this video so many months ago.. rlly glad u got into therapy.. u need it.  Keep it up, we miss u.
I think both Lily and Albert have move on. When I found out what he did I was very disappointed because I really liked the content he posted and I was very unsure if I should continue watching his channel or not... however, I think that apologizing and accepting his mistakes was the best thing he could do and I'm really happy he did. I hope he continues  with the great content :)
Glad you're back
your still a human its ok to do some shit sometimes, im here to support you if you come back
This is the most satisfying apologize video i watched this year. Damn mental health is really important esp whrn u engaged yourself to many people. Thankyou albert!
I hope people take away from this is that humans will always be humans. We will make mistakes. We adapt and will continue to adapt, from there know that if someone makes a mistake and tries to learn from that mistake, don't cancel them. Be mindful  of what you say, be uplifting and positive. Just be try to be a good human being. Thanks for reading this lengthy comment, just putting my thoughts out there.
Okay, this video is so fucking good. It made me think about whether or not i'm doing things for my own happiness
Holy shit you’re back! Nice!
good to see you back
I don’t like you and I never will like you like I did before when I looked up to you. However I hold no grudge against you (as if I had the right to in the first place) and the things you said in this re-introduction of sorts hit close to home, and I truly respect you as a person who’s simply trying to better himself, I really hope you’re changing for the better Albert, and I hope this is all genuine, to me it very much seems genuine. This isn’t even an apology video and it seems more genuine than any apology video I’ve ever seen, But I can only hope.
I'm gonna be honest, i barely know anything about what happened here, but this seems like it could be one hell of a comeback story. Massive props to you for actively working to get better and grow on your past mistakes
At least you understand what you did Humans make mistakes all the time No matter how big it is When you understand why you did it And able to improve yourself
i’m happy for you and i’m sure lily is too
It's ok. Everyone makes mistakes. It's already been about a year. Just move on and take care :)
I love everything about this video, and I can tell how much work you put in on this video. Welcome back!
this is a good bounce
giving up on the talent you possess and skills you refined would be the real mistake. I just learned of you and I anticipate seeing more content from the authentic you. Fuck all the people trying to hold onto the past. Your present and your potential are what everyone should be focusing on.
But... What camera did you use for this vid?
great video essay :)
Still care for you albert ❤ 💙
I hate you a lot, but damn, nice cinematography........
If whos here checking him out for some bullshit just get out
It's sad, most people that disliked didn't watch the full video :(
Best apology ive ever seen tbh
This may seem kinda weird, but I want to see this concept turned into an anime. A character who is hated by their peers and justifiably so. The process of adjusting back into normal life, after having a luxurious life taken away. The story isn't about success in the traditional sense; contrarily it focuses on someone trying to make it back to being a human again from being a villain. The success when the goal is completed won't look like anything to anyone around, but internally, that's where the victory is. I would love to see an anime that is able to animate the inner workings of a mind and capture this narrative progression of growth, with flashbacks showing the reason for the viewer to hate the character. Creating this dichotomy in the viewers hearts, by not making it easy to empathize with a character, but still leaving room for you to root for them would be beautiful.
we get it dude, you like bein artsy
we were never angry with you. we were just disappointed. I'm glad you accepted the mistakes you made and you try to be a better person after that
You've clearly taken a long time to self reflect and you now know what you have to do to better yourself as a person. Welcome back Albert. Anyone who thinks differently lacks any maturity and needs to take a long hard look at themselves. Besides, why is it their place to hold a grudge against you without actually knowing you? The Internet is a harsh place and knowing this is what everyone now grows up feeding on is worrying..
See you guys in 6 months for Fed's video
You ruined your career by cheating on your girlfriend, why are you being so dramatic, what's with the cinematography and the music and the seriousness in the tone.  It's not like everyone thought you were Jesus before. "hey its been awhile" yo who do you think you are?  Who has been desperately waiting for your return?   Everyone flirts with a redemption story but this is just petty to romanticize your own redemption.
I can sense and tell by this video that he is really trying to work his ass off to become a better man. I appreciate the honesty and heartfelt vibe from this video. Good to see you, Albert.
off topic but this is really well made..  i still feel weird, but its not my place. i'm glad you're taking care of yourself.
you have realized your mistakes and are working to become a better person everyday. i have no reason to be mad as lily has moved on. its time for everyone to move on aswell. your bettering yourself and thats all that matters right now
Beautiful video Albert, you got my sub again for this. i hope you fulfill your promises to yourself and be the person you want to be, i know we all are trying to do the same.
welcome back!
This was honestly a very insightful video. I might start working out now. If it helped you, it probably will help me.
Great video! Beautiful compositions, amazing themes, fluid storytelling. A very well put-together film, thank you for coming back.
Catch up with the league of legends Covers or else we will never forgive you 😡
You’re actually trying to play the victim here
7:40 check the street's name haha
Love will always die out soon dosen’t matter in what or who you are, it just happens.
Wow this is so well made. - this is like Wong Fu level in terms of emotional feel
It's nice seeing you again, Mr. Albert. I like your videos and hoping to see more of you soon. It takes courage to start over again and it's nice to know that you are reflecting and changing for better. Stay safe. Cheers!
I may be late to the party but Albert I’m happy you’re back and I accept the fact that you made mistakes but that is the end of the old Albert and thus a new chapter will begin
thank you
I think everyone can agree you that the right of pursuit of happiness extends to youtube. Despite watching lily before I was even an adult and having a very clear bias, I liked the production a lot but I felt like maybe waiting a bit before going all out (showing the eggs and messages on the phone) would have let people’s guards lower a bit, but I can see artistically what you were trying to do and I’m sure statistically it was the correct move in a sense.
Welcome back Also never heard swear so much
Ok, decent.
The thing that happened between them 2 happened The annoying part was the community being over dramatic Yes he cheated yet why would u care about it its not like ure their friend U made the guy feel like his life was almost over with millions posting shit get a life kids if he harmed or killed himself it would've off been u social  justice warriors who did that Fkin dramatic kids these days Also Alby welcome back man I can't wait for the next video!
Fed is gonna have a hard time topping this
as someone who has been cheated on i cannot forgive one who has done it to another innocent person. but i do accept that he is getting help and i think it is good he is getting help. i do not agree with sending death threats or unneeded hate, especially to someone who is in pain for other reasons. i hope you're well albert.
The only unsolvable mistake is judgment without regret
Even though you did fuck up it’s good to see that you’ve found what was wrong and are making an effort at fixing things. Good luck on your journey and can’t wait to see what you do.
I don't know what happened (idc) but this video was extremly artistic and beautiful... woa
This man has some serious skills. This whole video, despite what it relates to and specifically who made it, is a work of art. Im glad hes doing better, that everyones doing better. I wish all of you well.
Good that you're back, I never cared about any decisions you make/made. Wouldn't judge you anyway, do your thing man.   You're skillful and that's entertaining to me 👍
i love you
To be honest I miss Albert
To be honest I miss Albert
Everyone got a chance but remember Albert that you gonna use this chance for your past big mistake, if you fk up again this time... You just fk down your life of trust from people.   Then, just start a new journey and be happy :D
Welcome back, sir.  Hope you enjoy your life to the fullest. I'll surely wait for your videos.
Yo Albert heads up, we've got covid to deal with
1:25 "you're a piece of sh*t".....looks like some people are ready to give second chance to let you show whether you've become a better person or still the guy who did that terrible thing.....😓don't screw up again man.....they might not give you another chance....im really not the person to say this, but if you had to face people from the past,apologise to them and dont run the other way...face it. ps:i just recently started watching offline tv and came across 2 dramas at the same day. fed and this guy.....and watched his comeback vid right after seeing the drama vid😓....oh my day can get worse if his fans roast me without reading the comment fully because i annoy people by writing a f*cking essay.those who reads it fully, thx.
Welcome back
I;m really happy your coming back. i only had found your twitch and YouTube a few weeks before you left the scene. and i actually started playing the violin because i saw one of your videos. so to wrap this comment up i wanna say. i wont hate it if you start posting violin videos again.
Beautiful video. Wish the day you recover from the pain comes soon.
You're clearly a talented guy. Don't let one mistake hold you back.
One of the best video quality on the Internet without a doubt !
Forgiving yourself is more than enough. Because by forgiving yourself, you'll get better and change; in turn people will forgive you too.
Welcome back bro miss ya alot
Everyone acting like he committed a crime. Grow up tards. Glad to see him doing great.
the amount of people willing to forgive this guy is insane lmao what the fuck is wrong with yall
Albert welcome to the champion's club
We do not know each other on a personal level. You apologizing to your friends and LIly is far more enough. Don't even give a fuck about us. If your friends have forgiven you or not is the only thing that actually matters. Internet's a troll. The people in the internet are just observers and not someone who were meant to interfere.
Lol crazy how serious this is. Dude made a simple mistake that his overly sensitive fans and hate watchers buried him for. Glad you’re bouncing back. Don’t be so hard on yourself though.
Cancel culture is so dangerous. A lot of people can’t handle it and their mental health suffers so much. Everybody makes mistakes, but cancel culture make us think that if we fuck up one time, our live is over. Nonetheless, I can see that to surpass it you have to look inside yourself and learn that the only opinion that really matter is your owne. I’m glad your okey. I really hope your career grows from now on. Also, I admire your video. The production is amazing, it seems you have a lot offer to the world.
dab         just wanted to lighten up da mood :)
the People Who Dont Wanna Forgive Albert i wanna Say Something The man Changed Became Better So if you Still Hate him after That Video I am Sorry But you are a Heartless Piece Of Crap
u have a nice keyboard
why did 5:20 remind me of scarra / lily / pokimane / fed / toast lol
This is a really well thought out video btw. Wow.
Well at least you came back Albert. Let’s just not dwell in he past and continue moving forward. Hope to see much of your videos later on. Just do what makes you happy 😃
I definitely think he shouldn't get as much hate as he does because so many people cheat, millions of people cheat just like mizkif said. But now all of a sudden since he has some sort of following, that he's made a mistake now people are telling him to end himself like that's not cool...but it's just how the internet goes. Albert I hope you do well and make a big recovery from all of this.
Its good to see that you wannt to come back. I still like you Albert and great Video
Hey, atleast he's realized his mistakes
Good job Bro  Happy to see you again
That "Liberty Hill" sign though
You've been forgiven by __ who are we not to. Fix your life and be good again.
wait no shit, this actually cool.
All i saw in this video was a person trying to be honest to himself in front of the same public he left on yt/twitch Your life is yours as much as you left it private and it's of everyone as much as you open up to it. Hope you find a way to stay in public. I'm not gonna support some things you done in the past, but i'm gonna support an honest person Be free
Fair enough...  This video was made very well
Beautiful video mate. You know, we all fuck something up at some point and this is just part of life, the only thing is that for you it was displayed to the whole world.  Hang in there and move on, that's the only thing you can do.
Welcome back. Good luck.
Egg
this is done real well
Well..You cant be mad at this guy because otherwise mykull wouldnt be with lily :P
i'm not understanding why people are under the impression that this is an apology video???? this is clearly just an update video on what he's been up to and how he has bettered himself. it's fine if you still don't like him, but to me it's clear he's not doing this for sympathy points. albert has balls coming back onto twitch, but to me, he's coming back because he's changed. i personally wont follow him on his new journey, but i wish him luck nonetheless.
8:52 Is that Kyle Landry?
cool, welcome back.
a none cringe apology video with actual signs of growth and appropriation for redemption and the right to happiness, wholesome.
Glad you’re coming back stronger then ever Albert!
I forgive him and idk why people are mad at him it's not their business and people act like its affected themselves also are we just gonna forget about Katerino cheating on 7 fucking people, probs more but either way she took like a 2 week break and made a shit storm of an apology video.         also all these people saying cheating is so bad I can't believe he did it I would never etc. are so dumb, yes it's very bad to cheat but around 25% people in relationships cheat its not that uncommon
those 5k people that disliked this is the cancelled people who never change
i knew toast from years ago, then began to find out about offline tv, and what follows.. all about the drama.. as i wasted alot of my time, i searched everything happened, i search for albert channel, and this video is one of the best video i watch on youtube.  "cancel" is a culture, most of the times people in it is a shame to be part of it. but you are who you are.. cheers.
Do some people in prison deserve a second chance? If they do, Albert definitely does. Even though Albert can be seen as a public figure, he still deserves to live the rest of his life in a dignified way.
This was...kinda bizarre.   It was really self-reflective, yet simultaneously self-indulgent. Did we really need an establishing shot of him in therapy lol? The editing at parts reminded me of Parasite. Its a well made video, but if this was supposed to be an "Apology Video", it was way overproduced.   Which makes me think this wasn't an Apology Video, not entirely. He's already apologized, anyone who didn't forgive him back then probably never will. This video shared his personal struggle and growth, while also showing he's still got creative drive. He made this video for himself, and I mean that in a nice way. To pick himself back up.  Time will tell if he can live up to the image we and his grandma all thought he had. Well wishes man.
I hope you are doing well Albert. I wish you the best of luck to improvements and being a better version of yourself.
btw can someone agree with me that this is the best apology video ?
forsenCD
..............
It is good for you to acknowledge and move over your mistakes.. We all fuck up at some point in our life. It is all good!!! We have one life and it is too short. Congratz for the impeccable film-making skills, looking forward to your next posts! <3 stay safe
was a good movie type apology i gotta say, hopefully the results could come soon, good luck
Great to see you back Albert
God I hate this video. Over produced garbage. He said al amor nothing in the whole 11 min.  I don’t care that he cheated on lily. Just make good content
Fighting!
love you albert stay strong
You are a talented person destined for and creating amazing things. You made a mistake and you apologized. But more importantly, you grew. I have no position to pass judgement and I hope you continue to flourish and grow as you have done
You could in the end rip on albert for putting a meme or two in this vid. Or you could rip on it just because of the production quality. But i think if he came back with a one shot one take "sorry i fucked up, im trying out new things though!" I feel if i did that, after so long.. I wouldnt be satisfied. But in the end, we shouldnt hold grudges on albert. Everyone makes mistakes..
Not my apology to accept, but I can appreciate the work you've put in to bettering yourself and living honestly.
I’m glad you’re staying strong
People are so quick to judge. But most people sitting in twitch chat judging is also 12. They don't know what life is yet. And oh will they be surprised when life actually starts and they start making mistakes on their own.
We need on of this off of fedmaster
No worries man Lily has moved on and she feels better with Michael
albert i missed you so much, i forgave you very soon after the drama. The internet takes hate too far and now they've defined new hate i'm so sorry
I feel the purpose was not to apologize but rather to show us his thoughts and feelings why he was gone. He even said it was for himself. Sure its really well produced but its doesnt seem fake at least not to me. If you tell your life like it is people are gonna judge so f**k it jus ignore them. His cheating obviously stemmed from a bit from his unhappiness with himself cuz only unhappy ppl rlly cheat. He his self development and motivators to change. Ppl say he brought up his grandma for sympathy but directly says hes motivated to change through her. Thats at least what i got from the video. Sure leave a hate comment if u still dont like him but i respect him at least a lil bit. We all f**k up. But we all know the internet thrives on hate
Really good apology video.
When someone makes a perfectly excuted update video and there are STILL fucking delusional andy's in the comments saying " I think we can forgive him now " or " let's not hold a grudge against him " so it's either the women who have been cheated on and/or all the OLTV fans triggered that Albert dared to resurfaced. lol suprise .. HE DOESN'T OWE YOU ANYTHING !
Albert, life is a marathon, not a sprint. Take your time to live and look forward to another tomorrow. You're really strong to be able to stand up and make future goals to help better yourself. There are several people out there who love to hate on you and bring you down only because they couldn't do it and they cant bear to see someone succeed. Yes you messed up BUT you learned a lesson in the chapter of life that you call yours and thats the most important thing. Its not how you start, its how you finish. ~ Good luck
Albert made a mistake. Everyone does. He cut himself of from social media because that's what amplified the pain. So he has made a recovery. We shouldn't hate him for what happened in the past. We should support him for what comes next.
A genuine, well made video.
Its not my place to hold a grudge over the things he has done. Be proud of working on yourself but as of now I can't say that I can continue supporting you like in the past.. Best wishes.
So it’s ok when doc does it, but people try to cancel Albert when he does. Cheaters are not always cheaters long after
Look, I was mad at him too but everyone has moved on and it seems like he has apologized. Keep moving Albert.
This guy's apology surpassed what a lot of typical YouTube content creators failed to achieve, and that personally makes me laugh
holy i forgot what this man looked like or maybe he changed his looks
Albert you’ll probably never see this but we love you and just do your best to make yourself better. Love yourself <3 and can’t wait to see you come back bro love you man
I've seen this video 11 times...  Regardless of the message being said, I cant stop appreciating this mans talent with a camera...        Love you Albert!!! always have, always will... hope you get a fresh start.
You both messed up BAD yes. Backlash simps gave was immense yes. At least you're sorry and trying to change bro Your true fans missed you A LOT man, we're glad to see you're getting better         This video was nutty, can't wait for your next drop  <3
Great video
Eh. Kind of victim Andy, but also a bit of honest and battling Andy. But also some trickster Andy. I would hold my reservations about this dude. Hope he does change for the better though.
F to pay respects...
he is lost, but he will find his way forward.
We'll give you a second chance. Stay strong Albert.
Did u know fed got kick out in otv because something he did of lily and Yvonnie
Regardless of what happened, I don't believe it defines you. Since I've discovered you, you've remained my favorite content creator. I'll support you in any path you choose to lead your life.
Your filming skills are impressive :D
Never was into your content, i just stumbeled upon your channel again today and saw this. I wasn't there before michael joined so most of the Drama got past me but I went back to it later. Yeah, you fucked up, but you SHOULD absolutely move on by now. You clearly regret it, you payed your price, let yourself move on and the internet will hopefully do the same.   Also this video is fucking beautiful, shut up about not being a great artist, this shit's fire!
Tbh I think he should get a second chance, but  can I just say camera angles on point
All people who hate him need to stop because every one of us makes mistakes that is what makes us human and from the mistakes we grow as a person so stop the hate.
you will always receive criticism and backlash for choices and mistakes i hope the best for you moving forward and i hope the internet can forgive you
Although i am not really comprehend your  feeling , as a christian i want to bless you
This is a beautiful video.
Welcome back Albert, most of us are probably still mad about what you did. Looking at how you have grown though, makes me Happy, and I know some of us missed you a lot. I hope you're taking care of your self I can't wait to see what you have in store for us <3
I can't talk for everyone but as long as you understand your mistake and understand where your mistakes were and forgive yourself and imitating your faults and grow. We forgive you and just hope you'll start feeling like you again. Make sure to take care of yourself.
This video was very empowering. We all make mistakes. It's time to bounce back.
Yo I saw that Kyle cameo. I love that guy.
I don’t like cancel culture. Never believed in it because it’s the same as saying “You’re not allowed to make mistakes.” But you can and you should be because that’s what living life and growing is. I’m glad to see you’re doing better. Thank you for staying strong even in times when you felt weak.
I went in ready to dislike but as I watch, I think I'm gonna like it.
Welcome back. I wish you all the best for the future
This is a well done video, good job Albert.
7:40 street sign says liberty hill. Dam.
He cheated, that’s human/emotional mistake. He should have taken a different path if he lost feelings for Lilly in the past. He however did not murder anyone. So for people telling him to hang himself and stuff, shame on you, you are apart of the problem. He knows he messed up and now he must change. It makes me sad that society can cancel someone in a blink of an eye these days. Snowflakes ❄️.
Dayumm Albert, u did good son. U did good
this video highkey quality :O
I cried
HONESTLY IT WORKED OUT CAUSE THEY'RE DOING BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. idk yall so uhh....great fucking video :D. P.S: to the otv fam, if you see this (ik at least one of yall watching this shit), do secret signal. slap elbow, L shape arms, both sides ;)
Hey Albert been a long time viewer and I just wanted to say you got this homie even tho shit seems like dogshit right now i believe in the to rebuild from any situation your a smart and very talented individual and the true fans or supporters got your back bro stay strong my man.
WAIT DID HE BREAK PUT HIS PHONE IN WATER 2:06
Welcome back Albert!
This is how apologies should be made. Beautiful editing and excellent apology. He did nothing to me and I felt like it was an apology to me. That's how good of an apology it was.
This video was actually really helpful in understanding what kind of person albert is. I had written him off as an asshole after the drama but after this video, i'm starting to understand. Yes he did some fucked up things and im not saying any of it is ok but people fuck up, some times really badly. its a part of being human. But after watching this video its clear to see albert isnt a bad person, he just did some fucked up thing. You cant write him off for the rest of eternity for some dumb fuck ups.
Nobody is perfect and everyone fucks up once in a while. That doesn't mean that your done though, it's just a minor hurdle that's between you and the finishline. In a couple of years from now it will become just another part of your so so precious life an you'll be able to remember the good aswell as the ugly for the things they helped you to achieve. How could anybody learn without messing up. In the end it's all just a game of ups and downs.
This one is goodddddd, damn good
change of topic- editing skills ten out of ten
Great time to comeback everyone has shifted their hate on fed noe
Amazing video
Welcome back Albert
forsenCD PICK A CARD ✨ forsenCD ANY CARD ✨ forsenCD THE 2 OF WIVES? ✨ forsenCD EXCELLENT CHOICE ✨
You gotta admit this was one well-made video
Stay strong Albie♥️ This video is a masterpiece!
Holy heck. This was an amazing piece of work and made me feel things for ol' albert i didnt think i could. we are all continuously learning, fucking up, and growing from everything we do. I wish you the best if you ever read this. Good luck. You can do this.
It's kinda funny to see people still judging you in the comments... even if they're saying good judgements they shouldn't. Just say "happy you're back hope you're good now" and go think about you and your imperfections god damnit.
as a viewer we don't know everything that happened but i just hope they resolved it, he genuinely apologized and lily is healed from the hurt (seems like she's been happy so that's good)... i won't be able to follow albert anymore since i'll always have those doubts and trust issues in the back of my head but i hope he truly realizes and regrets his mistakes and will do better in the future. seems like he's been working on himself and people are ready to accept him so that's good i guess. all the best to his career, everyone deserves to be happy!
We all make mistakes Albert,  we are allowed to fail, we are allowed to make mistakes, I look forward to seeing you streams and content in the future. please smile :) whoever keeps asking you if you regret it, just bann the shitt out of them.
You don't really see people as strong and brave as Albert owning up about what they've done wrong and getting out of that void. This has motivated me to be a better version of myself.  Thank you for sharing and good luck.
The people who disliked did not understand his message. I too was about to go in with a negative mindset. Man cheated, what could be worse than that? Then he made me realize, that's what being human is all about. Making mistakes, even big ones, happen, but it's what you do afterward is what makes it important. I hope Albert can become the person he aspires to become.
Here's my take on it: this is not an apology video, it was never meant to be. He's already apologized, and saying sorry more won't do anything. This video is to prove that he's been working on himself, seeing a therapist, and changing. It provides substance, such that you know he didn't just say Oh sorry and then go right back to content creation. idk, just my take. feel free to respond if you disagree tho.
Find a physiologist that willing to help you. Figure out who you are. At the end of the video you are still trying to please someone else. Put yourself first. Than you will never do something you dislike again.
Hey what's up man. Everyone makes mistakes- it's how you correct those mistakes that determines the quality of you character. Relationships grow stale over time- I've been in your shoes before. You have to put yourself first no matter what- You weren't engaged to her or had kids. You cheated on her but you manned up and told her. You knew you were going to get this type of backlash, but you manned up. Don't beat yourself down- you don't deserve it. You were only going to be unhappy for the rest of your life if Lily wasn't the one- and everything worked out for Lily.
Just the effort on making this apology video  is enough to see how much he regretted his actions...
I need mi self a yeast boi.
imagine other people making parodies of this vid
Everyone's worrying about Albert but what about the other girl who fucked up. Wonder what she's up to....
Keep continuing on making yourself happy, Albert! I wish you the best.
It pisses me off that many of the "oh so understanding people" are the same people that were canceling and shitting on him.
Glad to know people can actually forgive. I  don't get why people think that content creators need to be the best people all the time. They're humans, they fuck up, some much more than others, some because of their circumstances.  We welcome you back Albert. We hope you'd grown from your mistake.
I might be wrong but I think you should reach out to lily if you haven't already
Holy shit this is such a good film. From what you've shown in the film it looks like you're tackling your problems in the best way possible and I think everyone should be super happy for you for moving in that direction.
Dude. I've been waiting for your return for so long. Been checking in on your twitter every now and then and hoping you are in a better place. Weirdly, the video made me feel like I'm sorta capable of forgiving myself of my past actions. Thanks a lot and hope to see more of whatever you're doing!
Uhm I dont know whats going ont his just popped up in my recommendation but this video is VERY well made like its reaaaallyy good.
You know what. Kudos.
If I don't sleep 8 hours a day I feel like shit.
Somehow hypersensitive and emotional Lilly came out of this better than albert
❤
man what a beautiful video essay. Truly, good job on this.
You messed up but you really reflected on it. I really respect you. Welcome back
We all have the capacity in us to cheat. Why are we holding him to such a high standard. People cheat all the time. People make mistakes. He didn't do anything that your loved ones didn't have the ability to do. Before you paint him as a monster, sit down and really think about all the horrible stuff you've done in your life and more often than not, it pales in comparison to what albert has presumably done. Cancel culture is going out of hand. I've cheated multiple times before and it was because I wasn't in a good place in life. It was a horrible thing to do but, If I had my entire career finished because of a small mistake, personally, I'd commit sewerside and that would all be thanks to how the internet handled the situation and blew it out of proportion. I bet you many of your favorite streamers (that you idolize as literal gods) have also cheated on their significant other; the only difference here is that they were fortunate enough to not have their unfortunate circumstances made public. Quit crying and give this dude a smooth transition.
"Sometimes good people make bad choices. It doesn't mean they are bad people. It means they're human."
Katerino take notes LUL
Welcome back 😁
Do your best :)
welcome back,i miss your magic so much
Damm this dude is in pain. You good Albert?
I mean everyone does mistakes, but is it ok to hate someone more because he/she is known on the internet?-No!...There are so many people out there cheating..maybe you who are watching this are cheating right now, or you are being cheated on. OTV moved past this and so can Albert. I started watching you because I love the things you do and I'll still watch you because of the same reason.I don't care what you've done or who you've hurt, as long as you are honest to yourself and understand what you need to do to better youself there's no reason for me to stop watching you.  #freeAlbert
Genuinely the best comeback/apology or whatever this is video i’ve ever watch, these 11:14 minutes just passed in no time. Insanely well made short film.
Pathetic
This video is inspiring, people will judge you no matter what, but what matters is that you stay true to yourself, we all make mistakes, we just need to learn from our mistakes and grow as a better person. The Internet is just scary, since we're free to judge people and leave a comment about their judgements. Just keep on doing what you love Albert, and be happy with your love ones. :D
I missed u glad to have u back
I hope to see more from you man this was a great Video
Welcome back, my guy!! loved the video and the quality can't wait for more of those! Subscribed
Welcome back Albert!
I pulled off my biggest "YEEEEESSSSHHH" when Albert showed Lilies.
Why comeback? Not gonna follow u tho u deserve what you have now
Why not make a video apologizing and that's it? Why on YouTube no one says "I'm sorry, I was wrong, I made a big mistake and I assume the consequences of my actions. I will try to be a better person, although being human includes making mistakes, I hope never to make a mistake that harms or includes others people. Thanks for listening to me "and that's it.   Anyway, I also think that it is an interesting apology format and that, if all that is told in the video is real, it is brave of him to document it in such a personal way to bring it to his followers.  (With this I do not want anyone to jump on me, I am not a follower of this man, I only know that they threw themselves on him for an infidelity - which by the way it seems sad to me that you send death threats for an infidelity, I don't see you doing that with the jerks on Big Brother or garbage tv shows like that - and he declared himself canceled.)
Plot twist:Why albert started going to gym so he could beat Michael in arm wrestle
How can you end up on good terms with someone who cheats on you? It's the one person you dedicate your life to?! Lily is way to nice...
Godbless, Albert!
7:13 Might be a coincidence or on purpose but "Liberty Hill".
My friend talked to me about you and the drama that happened a year ago. It's awesome you're changing. Keep going forward man.
Nice keyboard btw.
Is it just me or were the memes about this the funniest shit ever
People who disliked haven't watched the full video
Late to seeing this. Lemme guess, some guy got banned for asking Lily if she watched the vid.
At least he owned up to it, and I'm glad he did. I hope people will forgive him though, he seems like he understands his mistakes and will change. I will continue to support him through his tough times.
DAMN SO EDGY MY EYES ALMOST GOT CUT FROM ALL THIS EDGE
This video was very moving and beautifully presented. The message behind it is also very wonderful and I hope you’re doing well now and in the future Albert!
this is the weirdest, most self-obsessed piece of media I have ever seen and I will use it in my research about parasocial manipulation, thank you.
Being a cheater is one thing but being a cheater that has realized his mistakes is a whole other thing.  Hope your journey back to the light becomes a fruitful one.
You and I fucking up makes it more relatable with others, on different levels, to surrender our “inner demons”... most of us slip up an do something that either changed the subject or changed the life. Weird how that is but I think this is much needed to recalibrate ourselves. We have to remember what we know and love to do, especially when we don’t have much time on this planet, earth, this era, etc.
Do you want to play genshin impact?
0:52 and many other people closest to me.. *shows Lily*
Hope you'll get blessed one day.
nah dude the thing u be doin in the past year is making the quality of the video sick af
Jesus fucking Christ, this video is so well made.
I want lily to see this
2 time ForsenCD
Keep smiling
Yes. Asian David Blaine making his greatest Anime Comeback. Let's see what you got.
its been a while, welcome back buddy
7:39 The signboard actually said Liberty Hill. *sob sob*
I think it’s really good that you’re striving for change, striving for something better.
This video is cool
gg my g  u got me on ur side
Editing is on point, ngl
Okay besides everything that has happened. Can I just say, his film making skills are amazing
Is that Kyle landry at 8:51 ?
Glad to have you back ❤️
Good luck.
hey albert i thoght i hated you before how you fliped up from beiing the boyfriend of a lofi creator/streamer/youtuber that is double your sub count but after this i hope you can do a better job restarting your life all over as a new person i know your old gf @LilyPichu is now with somebody else AKA @Michael Reeves but i hope you finally restart as a better man i wish you luck
not gonna lie but ive been waiting for this- you to come back and you came back strong thats for sure
Did this man escape the gulag
The video is astounding, it is more of a special way to express yourself, please keep up.
It's okay Albert. Keep practicing and may Ling Ling be always with u
Good luck.
You fucked up but we all make mistakes. As long as you learned from it and better yourself then its fine. I wish i could be like you. I still need to atone for what ive done. Though i do not support what you did in the past i support what youre doing in the present. Safe keepings mate.
I just dont understand how some people keep thinking this is a apology. PLEASE understand that this is about him coming back.
This was a really beautiful video and I can see the growth in this video. We all make mistakes but we must realize that these are the consequences but which we can learn from after building ourselves up again. Keep working on yourselves not for others but for yourself so everyone can be happy. *heart*
This is Deep.
what he did in the past doesn't define him and his music.
jiayou
Hey, everyone deserves a shot at forgiveness. Dr. Disrespect also made a major mistake, and he was generally forgiven. Do you, we always mess up on this journey of life.
not a fan of whatever you did, but always a fan of your content. you're so immensely talented. all the best, albert!
Albert I wanted to say I’m sorry for what happened all that shit happened I admired you but when I heard what had happened I was like one of those guys that said kys and shit I apologize even tho u probably didn’t notice me I didn’t know what pain you were going through and I didn’t care but I came to check on you and saw this video I’m sorry and be strong
The production quality of this is insane
For all of you guys who think this video is a horrible “apology” video keep in mine he never stated it was. People can change, just give him a chance. Lily has already forgiven him, so why can’t you. If you still don’t think he changed then I totally understand.   Thank you for listening.
This video is well put and high quality holy damn
Dam I came to see comments with like 4 words nah all I see is big a** paragraphs 👁👄👁
This is how "apology videos" should be - not an attempt to stay relevant, or an attempt for people to still like you, but instead a commitment to everyone that you are willing to change. Nothing else.  We believe in you Albert, and we hope you do well.
I have to admit, I got really, really disappointed for what you did. Solely because I look up to you so much and to see what just transpired, well, I can't help but be hurt from it all. I felt hurt for everyone, especially Lily. So for a while, I too was one of those who went along with the cancel thing (but never in my life would I ever tell anyone to kill themselves). Hate is a strong word, and I never liked feeling it or focusing my attention to doing it. So, eventually I came to not just give a damn about what happened anymore. My thought was "It's happened. Wherever he is, I don't really care anymore. Best I hope is he's getting the help he needs", because Lily, ever the person full of love for everyone, wants that as well. In the recent issue with Fed, her take on it includes the lines: *"... I want to help him (Fed), the same way I want to help Albert"* . Glad to see you are getting help and continuing to get better. Better than not do anything at all and choose to rot away forever. I now feel proud  you're doing this.  No one knows what the future upholds, but that doesn't mean we should just stick with what happened in the past. You chose that and so you'll grow, and I hope things can finally become good for everyone, including you.   Good job, Albert. This was a great video.
I look at Youtube comments and I just love how everyone is nice and respectful and even supportive.. then I go to twitter and I just get depressed holy shit why do we use Twitter again. Also why the fuck do random people think AlberT OWES THEM AN APOLOGY... Like what the fuck it has nothing to do with you.
He’s doin this now that he’s realized funds are low he should have just said sorry I cheated and continued doing content and took on the hate from the community but rather he just ran away and hid until the hate has died down and now wants to come back.
I'm happy you're back.
hey man its good to hear you doing ok. If u see this just know you still have people who are here for you.
Forgiven
powerful stuff, man. Thank you for sharing. This philosophy you've acquired is something I truly admire :D
Saw you on an old Offline TV video. I hope you're doing okay
Post when you want and if you have time we will support you. :D
This might not be the best thing to ask. But are Sarah and Albert couple or no????
Good to see your back
more than anything, i hope you've forgiven yourself
Welcome back :)
My friend can't sleep without you streaming on twitch, hustle back again, we love your content.
I feel like this should be all it takes, an apology and proof that he is trying his best to do better and move on, best of luck and I'm sorry for your grandmother
we shouldn’t hold a grudge on Albert. He’s grown and owned up to his mistakes. He’s not asking for forgiveness from us, he’s just here to show how far he’s come and what he’s been doing during the time he’s been gone. It’s not our place to hold a grudge on him for what he did. Lily’s moved on and is happy. Welcome back, Albert.
Man that production quality is so good. I miss this in content creators. Excited for you to come back despite your complications. Hoping to hear some music
For my own opinion, what albert truly need right now is forgiveness/acceptance, not just from his fans but from all the people that has been affected by his actions. True what he did is fucking stupid but I believe he can become better than what he was. We all make shitty mistakes all the time but that's why we ask for second chances to prove ourselves to the people we disappointed. Redemption. Even though not everyone might agree to my statement but the point is im sure there will be a time when some of us will forget about everything and move on. Keep pedalling albert, take your time take it slow, it's okay to go alone.
you can SEE how much effort he put into this video.
just stopping by to say that I enjoy the cinematography and style of this video. That is all.
Really good video. Looks really professional.  I hope you'll return with great content.
Good seeing you again dude, hope you became better. Everyone makes mistake.  For people that makes mistake, yes it is a burden that cannot be thrown away but we can change for the better  P.S, don't roast him for what he has done in the past, but support him today for him to become a better person. He realized his mistake in the past and wanting to make up for the time he did and that is a good thing.  It takes courage to tell the mistake that you done  So Albert, if you are reading this, keep moving foward and become better in the future👍
I've been feeling the same with albert for 6 months, but yes, friends and family are the only poeple I could talk to
How to regain respect
I know it isn't my right to say if I forgive you or not because I wasn't the person in this situation. But honestly I see huge improvement you did seek help, you did change from the looks of it,  you know you made a mistake and honestly everyone can have a second chance.
This hit me the worse "I can never say no" that also defines my whole life.
That's amazing content creation and you have a bright future my friend! Good luck in your endeavors! P.S. I follow your music too. Really good stuff.
Thank you Albert. You’re alright man. Thank you. Much love
really looking forward to seeing more content from you !!!!welcome back!!!
I’m very shocked it was a very good video I’m happy for albert  that he starting to grow and move on to his next chapter this is giving me inspiration to do as well I hope everybody  Albert and fed grows and learns more im happy for them
I forgive u bro
🙏❤️I’m So Sorry To Hear About Your Loss. Sending My Condolences And I Hope Everything Will Be Alright Soon❤️🙏 I Hope You Can Come Back. As A Better New Person! I Wish You The Best! Stay Safe!
I’m really surprised this didn’t get spammed with dislikes.  Good to see people still have sympathy or and just moved on
you gotta go litsen to  Comethazine - Derek Jeter
he's been workin' out to defeat michael in arm wrestling.    its a joke pls dont cancel me
I believe in you Albert your the greatest person to ever have even if you did fucked up because I to was that person and It’s hard to have that person or the people you loved forgive you but don’t let the hard times get you and I know all of us people has made mistakes and that’s part of life but don’t let the people get you when they say I never made a mistake in my life I’m perfect I’m the high ruler of all and blah blah, honestly don’t listen to them just because they said that because they’re a low life person who has done something in the past and just don’t wanna bring it up. I didn’t do what you did but it still made my ex be upset because of what I said to her friend and that torn us apart. We can do better, we just need a better Albert, a Albert who’ll be at the top of the food chain and I or we all believe in you Albert 😁
hey congratulations on coming back!! so proud of you!!!! after everything that has happened, even though you were wrong, atleast you know what you did and trying to be a better person
Yes, you did, but everyone deserves a second chance. Best of luck to you Albert here's to the future.   Truly inspirational to see that no matter how hard you fall, you can always get back up.
video:  -losing joy old hobbies not working  -learns about coffee and making yeast -goes back to old hobbies  it's kind of like women, the one you stick with then the ones you take a break to enjoy just to realize they aren't as good as what you already had. deep video good message man omegaLUL
First of all this Video is so good and second of all it's rly inspiring because i myself fucked up and need to work on myself and this videos gave me some good ideas to try  i hope you continue this good path
I dont know who this guy is, but damn thr quality of this video is crazy
The cinematography in this video... Dude my eyes are out wtf. Amazing job man👍👍
The people who were effected and hurt have moved on and so should the rest of the internet. I have new found respect for Albert now as a person and a damn good director, even if my level for respect started at zero. The video it's self is incredible and the message/meaning behind it the same. He seems like he's genuine in his words and actions so I don't see a reason for people continuously berating him, especially people who don't know jack shit about the situation offline.
I'm so glad he's back, I've been so worried
hope youre doing ok!!
I'm glad he's back
all this cuz Albert cheated once, i cheat 5 times a day and sleep like a baby
imagine if we just lived without judging people for their personal lives, we would've had more of theser sicks videos the past year its a shame.
why not delete all ur socials like that girl did and start all over somewhere else
Albert Is so talented Holy shit
Omfg he’s back?
The filmmaking in this video is just amazing. That's all I have to say
cool production
Fuck man... I wasn't watching your content when you got cancelled but recently I've learned about it and I'm really upset for you man. From the clips I've seen, you seemed like a genuinely interesting guy and watching this video pains me to see you in this rough patch. I hope you can fix you life up and head back on the straight and narrow. I believe in you.
I am really happy for you, and I admire the fact that you’re working to grow!!! You’re really very courageous to do this: acknowledge, apologize, move on. 🙏🏻 Wish you lots of blessings Albert. :)
As a simp, we don't care about you no more. We are more focused now on Fed's return. Have fun, with your life, lol.
If Lily has forgiven Albert and moved on, then people who are still hating on Albert are the idiots and the true horrible people here.
I wish all content creators did the same thing as Albert after whole "Canceled" thing. I hope we all will be able to see him raise once again
This video was really well polished, and i hope for the best 🙏
By the way great video dude like for real great production.
Let's move on who here hasn't fuck up in life that's how we learn I'm a big believer that god works in ways we dont see maybe if albert didn't fuck up who knows how there relationship would be, she would have never got with Michael who seem to have a better fit things happen for a reason. Take a look in the mirror and judge yourself before you judge others
I've been waiting for you, welcome back
I don't support the shit you have done but I'm glad that you're doing great, I believe that people can change so please don't do it again and welcome back.
Everybody makes mistakes and you admitted to it and I support you everybody makes mistakes
Wow. Thank you Albert for sharing this Video. I'm sure you worked hard since November, and we all can see it. Im really curious for future Content. Stay strong.
MY MAN forsenCD
Bro really said “deez nuts”
Waiting for the next upload
This is a good video, recovery is a difficult thing for such a public figure.  Good on you to find the strength for a rebound and strive to the future
Elon be talking shit lmao no hate😂
Wasn't subscribed before crisis, (crisis meaning break up) nor during crisis, but I am now a proud subscriber
Props to you for eating the one that you cared about wish I could do something like that 😂😂
Welcome back
Victim victor
Honestly, this video is well executed and I can acknowledge the hard work, even if the person who made it has fucked up big time.  It’s not anyone’s place to forgive or cancel, unless you were the person involved. It’s been clear the past months that she’s moved on, and so will he.   Welcome back, Albert. good luck :)
even though i hated you for a while, glad you’re back. missed ya, not gonna lie.
LETS GOOOOOO i missed ya albert
Bruh
Weirdos on the internet legit think you shouldn’t be allowed to do what you love and make a living if you cheat on someone. But then they go and watch their favorite streamer, Dr Disrespect!
Welcome back! Everyone fucked up once, but I think you are on the right track! Hope you have a nice day and wonderful days ahead. Keep doing things you love
I am some what glad that he's okay I don't know if I can forgive him yet but I hope he can fix up him self and make his mistakes in to a lesson. PS nice "I'm sorry video" (0u0')
What you did was horrible, and you hurt the people who truly trusted and cared for you. But that doesn't mean you can't work to make amends. It's good to hear how you have seeked help and centered yourself. Hope to see you pursue your goals in the future.  By the way, this video is extremely well done. I don't know how long it took you to make it, but it is so aesthetically pleasing to view. Keep it up.
He was a shitty asshole but that was in the past, you don't hold grudges for too long unless they hurt you you mentally, think you are useless, or just an asshole just like what lily went through, but she can just as easily release it just like us who has no hearsay in their relationship or their lives.
Is it just me or is this incredibly well shot
the scenery in the end was beautiful
you got this :)
I’m so proud of you. And I know that might not really mean anything from some random person on the internet but I truly am even though I don’t really know you. I would like to say we’re here but we (the fan base) arent very comforting when it comes down to it considering anything you tell us will circle around and you will no longer have privacy. But I’m glad you shared this. It was the perfect amount to make me so proud of everything you’ve done.   So.   Good job, Albert.
Good for you Albert... Hope you really become the person u want to be ...  She moved on ... you too have to...  move on to be become a better person ...
This is your bounce back story, walk tall my friend. It's not going to be easy, but I believe you can do it
Ayo. The last thing this man want to hear is about cheating. Just congrat him on a great video
We missed you albert Every one makes mistakes Some Will forgive you and some will still hate you. but be yourself improve your life
Ayyyye. Feds is coming next.
please tell me that was a fake violin that he broke
Its fine bro at least you didn't commit suicide.
I like Yeast boy
After among US, I learned about the dramas XD. But wow, he is a brave boy.
The Internet likes to choose sides and demonize people.
Damn he plays the clarinet?? 😍
Its okay.. i also improved and i learned to not hold grudges..soo your still a good person since you realized about your mistake and wanting to forgive.. Its okay Albert :)
In the end of the day we are all human and we all make mistakes
Stay strong brother, we all cheat on our girlfriends, its ok women dont matter
Always in awe of your trix, glad youre back on yo fix Loved the vibe of your stream, time to take back your dream
At this point if you make good content I'll watch for the content if you genuinely feel like your better than I'm down to watch your content you know you fucked up and it's good you took so much time to figure out how to be happy with yourself or a little happier than you used to be
Before you dislike this, maybe you should watch the video and also learn from this. Not only from you and his mistake(s), but your own. Life is a learning experience we all fuck up, very badly or not. What matters is what you do next and learn from your experiences. Yes it's hard to re trust someone, start something new, and fix things. But you have to try, at least a little to see what it's like, cause it can help you and others. Don't be selfish, no one's perfect.
masterpiece of a video
It's okay! Welcome back!
this video was beautifully made albert. and as much as i was so sad because of your past mistakes, this was such a unique and personal way for you to demonstrate your own growth. i only wish the best for you albert, and i know it is not my place to hold grudges for someone who is not myself (please keep that in mind ppl in comments)!! thank you for this albert. proud of you 💗
The symbolism tho.... 0:52 7:40
Albert we will forgive you if you forgive yourself. Stay strong
Thank you for making a video for the people who think they fucked up and their life is fucked and they cant do anything about it. Like you said change does not happen fast its a lifetime process ! So I hope people do not  lose faith and hope and be brave enough to challenge their life and try to make it better. MORE POWER TO YOU MAN!!  People make mistakes but people who own their mistakes never fails!
this inspired me to continue my passion.
No matter what i tried i felt no happiness. Call the chick to suck you off thats a good way to start  you fraud. Love the two monitor pictures but i am missing the google doc there that would be dandy.
Just be faithful to people plz.
That's a big ass mistake but I won't hold a grudge. Good luck my dude.
It's a whole thing in itself to make a video like this, we all make mistakes, some get into an even worse habit after it, but it looks like you've actually learned from it, which can NEVER be NOT accepted. Goodluck.
8:51 KYE LANDRY
So the redemption arc begins
It's good to hear you are being proactive about everything.
@sleightlymusical - what you did was wrong yes, but if you get anything out of this is learn from your mistakes and move on. Im sure you are not fully back but I wish you the best and can't wait to see the new you... Albert 9.0
If I'm being honest I really didn't want to like this, but it was a really good video. I like how you focused on yourself and were so vulnerable yet creative. I also thoroughly enjoyed the metaphors. I think you're right and it's a waste to let one mistake ruin everything else we stand for.   As someone who is also going to therapy for the first time recently, good luck on your journey.  I'm sorry for your loss.
the followers, i understood the reference i dont get the onions i like ur editing
Welcome back ^^
I am crying 🥺
Thank you Albert, I needed this.
Yo Albert. I need help with Google docs, will you post a video walkthrough or I will ask Michael then.
Glad ur back man
U know ur good just don't cheat again
I just want to say this video was really well made
This is not an apology video. This is not an apology video. This is not an apology video. He has formally made an apology on twitter. Stop saying this is an apology video because it about alberts life and dealing with the consequences with having fucked up a situation
Everyone messes up. Big or small, everyone messes up at some part of life. Doesn't mean we shut down entirely or end our lives. People are hypocrites to say bad things about the flaws of one person and applaud the same flaws of another more famous person. We're nobody to compare, we're nobody to judge. We don't even have enough brain cells to sort out our lives to live in a perfect way and yet we go around guiding, blaming and making rules for people we've never seen. Grow up folks. Welcome back Albert.
One could say this was your greatest magic trick but I hope many aren't fooled by these smoke and mirrors.
I'm pretty sure this is an update video not an apology...
Welcome back.
Honestly, i won't stick around but this video is great. I wish the best for you
Shit man that's hard
Hey i'm glad your back. But still i am gonna say this veeerrrryy bad advice. Forget the dramas and live your life without chains. Were all going to die anyway so might as well have fun with it.
It is sad to miss out on someone this talented. Great to see you back.
he just cheated bro, why we acting like he gunned down children?   check your own family and see if anyone's ever cheated
We are supporting you, Albert, do your best and find your own happiness. We're glad you're back :>
I believe in you man.
this was really well done albert !
We need to respect Albert, he realized he made a very big mistake and he’s trying to become a better person
Forgiven👍🏽
good shit cheating on that treesh bro
The effort you put into this video demonstrates your desire to push forward. I'm not ready, and I'm sure many others aren't ready to forgive you just yet, but you're doing things right so far.
As much as I hated him before, I'm a bit envious he can move forward. You just gained a new subscriber. I never condone what you did, but I am both glad and jealous of what you are now, of what you're trying to be.
I hope you're doing better Albert, and I hope we will see a lot more of you in the future. Love ya <3
My man, good wishes for you career
if u want to be happy than apologize to lily and play among us with michael and the others oh wait he already apologized  play games with the OTV members and others  *gasp* why did u burn Thomas! mxr is coming for ya now  R.I.P grandma 🥺
Well come back
cinematography is so goot tho tf
I just wish him well. that's it.
Welcome back, wonderful video glad to see you can accept your wrong doings and acknowledge them and build from there. Keep it up bud
TBH i fucking hated  you after what you did. one of my favorite content creators showed me you were an asshole, and you hurt one of my favorite content creators while I had barely known who you were in their life. (I got more into them after this whole thing went down, and it went unmentioned for a bit)   However... Lily would not want hate sent your way. Hate is a very negative and dark representation of the feelings that I have for a STRANGER. On top of that, cancel culture can be pretty ridiculous. You made a mistake when trying to juggle many difficult choices in your life, and many other young men do the same for less reason.   I think that even though I didnt' really know you before, I've seen your content since then and I'm glad that you're back. I'm glad you worked on yourself. This was an extremely tasteful video that I hope more youtubers take note of for the future. Being under the spotlight as a content creator is probably an unimaginable pressure compared to the rest of us. I'm glad, too, that you've set this video as a reminder for yourself for the future. Also the flower was a perfect acknowledgement.
I’m more worried about fed tbh
Regardless of what actually happened the screenplay was actually really good
Welcome back!! I look forward to see more content from you.
I believe in second chances, you do you homie. Best of luck to ya. Really liked the quality of this video.
Holy shit this is deep.
Damn this video is inspiring.
Hes no social repose, he made 1 mistake. People need to stop investing so much hate into other peoples online lives.
In my honest opinion, it's not the internet's right to forgive Albert. It's Lily's. I've seen all the Twitter people continue to harp on Albert, and I don't think it's our place in my honest opinion. The pain he inflicted was on her, and if she's forgiven him, which I think she has. We should learn that his business is not ours.
Just like miz said, twitch community is full of hypocritical retards as audience. Stay strong, Albert.
hoping you all the best of luck, man.
I don’t care about anyone’s opinion on what he’s done, in fact I’m not really sure myself  But this video’s style is an absolute fucking masterpiece
Stayed a subscriber, never justified what you did but I didn't really care I just liked your content. Glad you're back dude.
I’m really happy to know that you haven’t given up. I was sure that you did for a long time and it made me feel pretty bad, even though I was never one of your fans per say. I believe in you, a lot of other people do as well from reading the comments. You’re doing the right thing
I like this vid, I just wish him the best and to everyone who may have fucked up in life
Good to see you Albert can’t wait to support and help you if you need it!
jeez the production quality on this video is ridiculous
I really appreciate this and am so glad you're on the long road of self-improvement and that you're creating again.
Having lily react to this would probably fix the hate 🤐
4:12 yooooooo he still has a nautilus
It just me or is video entertaining strangely
This is incredible work Albert, you are amazing man
PICK A CARD forsenCD ✨ THE TWO OF WIVES? forsenCD ✨ EXCELLENT CHOICE forsenCD ✨
I don't who you are or what you've done but this video is so relatable
Nice video. Still think you're not that great of a person for cheating. I dislike cheaters period and I doubt they can change that part of them. Glad you're concentrating on your mental health and trying to be a better person.
I was never a fan of albert, i met him through offline tv and i came across this since is one of the "current topics" on many streams. Most likely i wont watch albert's content, same as before any of this happened, but people who come here to throw hate at a person u dont know, in behalf of a person you also dont know says a lot about themselves, specially since a whole year passed and they still hold a grudge. I think the only opinion that could possibly matter here is lily's, and if she is fine with it then so am i.
Welcome back King!  Cheers to a better you, better day and better future.  Forgiveness is the strongest weapon and all you can do right now is forgive yourself. All Love Homie!
Who is he and what did he do
Why am I getting this notification now?
Proud of the apology good to hear the honesty
You used to be one of my favourite streamers, and i wish you the best and hope you've learned from your mistakes. I'll be checking in to your channel and streams and hope I'll enjoy them as much as I used to, but I'll always keep in mind that things are going to be different from before.  Either way I loved the comeback video, and I hope you'll continue working on yourself to live a happy life!
This is probably the best produced apology video I’ve seen. Good Job Albert and good luck on your future!
Come back I'm bored
I hope these comments give you a boost. You are a good human, you have things to offer. You just made a really stupid heartless mistake, some would argue the worst thing anyone can do to another person. But, the past doesn't exist right now. Neither does the future. What matters is what you do in the moment. I struggle a shit ton with living in the moment myself and Albert, it seems that you've really started to live for the moment.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
"and many of the people closest to me" *shows Lillies* yikes...
Holy shit this was such a high quality video. Good luck on the comeback
Hope things turn good for you and thank you for taking the time to become better. While it isn't 100% better, we can see that you're trying.   Thank you Albert.
This is the perfect example of when you fuck up, you don't hide and you don't ignore it. You own up to it and work on yourself and fix your mistakes. I really respect this video and your effort to improve yourself. We as people are bound to make mistakes but as you said it's what you do after making a mistake that matters.
Is this a Netflix show?
I wish you the best of luck man.
look at how long he’s been gone after making a mistake and how he’s been working through it compared to fed who IG’d a month later after his incident was opened up. it’s obvious one actually learned their lesson and the other didn’t
I’m not going to say anything else. People will feel how they want, but this is a really well made video.
This feels like a movie trailer but good for him on gaining some confidence
Welcome back Albert!
Mad respect for you dude! And i hope you become happy in life because everyone deserves it. People need to relax and this blew up way more than it should. Also to everyone hating, your not a saint either grow up come on.  We all know you have things you don't talk about in your little closet.
Are you gonna be streaming again? I really enjoyed your streams and I'd like to support you again
This basically sums up what everyone during covid went through.
Alright now where’s fed?
Good on u man
can someone tell me what this guy did wrong?
This edit it fuckin clean AF
"Hit the Gym if your depressed"       Im depressed that Im Lazy af
I really hope people can understand mistakes are made and people grow and change.
More power to you Albert!
People should be held accountable for their actions. And cheating is absolutely a shitty thing to do, but if you’re not in the public eye, It doesn’t usually ruin your life as much as it does when you are. People shouldn’t blindly defend their idols, but if you believe that people are irredeemable and can’t grow and change EVER— Literally no matter what— because they cheated on somebody... I’m sorry but that’s just not a fair standard to hold over anybody. This was a beautiful and artistic video that still managed to be tasteful. I love Lily’s and offline’s content. I support her and her healing and her new relationship being much healthier for her. I’m also happy that Albert is working on himself and can also create beautiful art. We should all work to be a little less judgemental, because we are all flawed. No that doesn’t excuse shitty behavior, but we need to know that we’re all capable of doing shitty things, and also doing good things. If Albert is trying to do good things now, power to him.
POG
you and i are quite similar people. your dedication to everything you do can be your biggest curse, but also the only thing you feel you really have. what you did was shitty. but im certain literally everyone else has done shitty things too- some shittier than others. you know that already. im sorry you had to go through all that albert... we're only human, after all.   that being said, im genuinely looking forward to your future. after all. we do things best when we hit rock bottom.
honestly people should have empathy toward him, he wasn't happy in his relationship and it was public, how many of us would have been cowards like him.
Gotta give him credit. This film was amazingly made.
hey toshinori ... you know when you are stuck always remember your .. Origines ...
Wow this is really depressing...
Keep your head up! Remember, everyone makes mistakes. We live and learn from it.
Nice video.
You should play Among Us with OTV.
Congrats, you cheated on someone who cares about you, and all you had to do was lay low and put out a video and people forgave you. It will go down as the greatest trick on your channel
I wont see more videos like this!
if y’all want an apology video go to his twitch he did a full livestream going face to face on what happened over the year
God why are there people who still don't understand? He acknowledged that he messed up, he went to therapy because its the worst thing that has happened to him,  yet some people are taking information wrong "he's using his grandma for sympathy points" "imagine going to therapy even though you cheated" he was telling us what happened to him after the whole thing, he went to therapy because he know he messed up and he's filled with regret You guys also need to keep in mind that its not easy to open up, you have those days where your mental health isn't that good so it leads to bad decisions  C'mon man don't try to kick him down while he's trying to get back up
welcome back!!!
Glad you’re back
Lol all this production but all he did was cheat on his girlfriend? I was expecting he took part in covering up sexual abuse or some actual shit
damn this video is really a masterpiece
NICE VIDEO DUDE. Look at the likes and you know that most of the people are able to forgive, we might not be the most heard part of the internet, and it's easy to only hear negativity. But i'm glad that you are glad, that you are doing great, and that you were able to find peace and happiness by your own. And STOP SAYING THIS IS AN APOLOGY VIDEO. It's not. It pisses me of that all the random redditors or twitch chatters are out there saying "VICTIM ANDY OMEGALUL" "WELL PRODUCED APOLOGY WEIRDCHAMP". Fuck you. Why on hell would he make an apologies video for us? We where not his girlfriend. Twitch chat is so dumb. But hey, they can spam all they want, they are only a small fraction of retards that don't represent the whole viewership. Likes and numbers say it all. Mizkif said it really well. Lost a lot of respect to xqc honestly. Welcome back.
Good for you? I still hate u :)
While what you did is still considered unforgivable, you are learning from your mistake. To know that you've created this video as a forever lasting reminder for yourself and that you're working yourself to the bone to make a change is wonderful. My condolences for your Grandmother's death, I'm sure she's watching your progress and is proud. I hope you will never make that mistake again nor will you ever make any more as huge as it.
I've been waiting for you to come back
How do you know its a Yeast BOY tho ?? Anyway, nice to see you alive and kickin Albert. Welcome back.
He fucked up really bad but honestly he don't deserve so much hate
How did you make money during the hard times?
This is amazing and the massage is even better nice job albert
a lot of people don’t really like you including me... but i do believe that can change
I've missed you
Welcome Back Albert!
I wish you the best Albert.
victom viktor :)
Welcome back. I hope everything goes well for you in the future.
I screamed at 0:53
tbh he could say "Sorry" a Year ago and nobody will care today. I Care about his Content, if he cheating or kill someone, is not my business.
:o
Also this Video is f*cking Master Piece this is the Quality of CONTENT that I wish all YouTube video was like.
Am I welcome in your Community even if I don't really watch twitch and Only watch comps of you? I support bruh no matter what. Everyone make mistakes "No One Is PERFECT". Love you bruh wish you good luck.
Welcome Back!!! Albert. Please notice me. I really like you and I really look up to you. Damn this video made me cry.
Hey, I knew you'll be back. Bruh I've been waiting for you. I'm happy that you are here now. And This video doesn't just show that you've learned a lot and it's also for other that's experiencing the same situation. This what I call content creation damn. I'm so shock how the video is this good. I hope all the Video I'm watching is in this quality. Bruh you've just setted a high standard for the video that I want to watch.
I'm proud of Albert for taking the steps to better himself, even though we can all agree that the things he did are not favorable. we can all agree that this is a really strong thing to do, putting things behind, looking to better himself, showing himself to his friends and the public. It doesn't matter if he would've apologized in this video or not. Like the video says this is about him, this isn't about drama.
You got my 110% support!
7:11 The sign reads "Liberty Hill". The fucking attention to detail. (For those of you who don't know, Lily and Albert's ship name used to be Liberty)
I wish Pokimane's apologies were even a fraction this good
Welcome back! I loved the video. And to a certain extent is I relate to you. I wish you the best man!
Hey Albert, try watching Thich Nhat Hanh videos. Also, when will be your next upload?
amazing
Welcome back!
I don’t think I am in a place to forgive you. I don’t know you, nor do I know the whole story. I’d just be glad to have you back since I loved your playing. Do what you love and if we like it we stay. It has worked once already, hasn’t it? Why wouldn’t it work again?
you're a really good filmmaker dude
you deserve consequences for your actions, but everyone should be able to support themselves. You're allowed to continue with your life even if you fucked up. You don't have to be a youtuber or have a presence on social media. You're a great cinematographer so you could work behind the scenes. You should make movies. Life has to continue, you're allowed to continue.
You don't owe everybody an apology. I don't know why people think you should to apologize to everyone who was not related to what happened. Welcome back!
yo the imagery, narration, pacing and format of this video is S-tier. Albert you're an artist in a ton of mediums, welcome back!
:( im just sad...
Bro, straight up this video Made me respect you soo much and you have earned it congrats on the progress and good luck with the future
5:20  Left to right: Scarra - Lilly - Poki - Fed - Toast
What u did Nothing next to fed
Very relatable, minus the working on yourself part
you've shown maturity and self growth, in my opinion i think you just made a mistake and now its a mistake you'll think twice about doing again.
Tbh the whole thing was just majorly exaggerated, like 20% of the population cheats in one way or another, it's shit sure, but no need to literally destroy someone's career for it. Besides that, this video is very well done and has good editing.
Most people here act as if they never made a mistake in their lives. People make mistakes, and Albert really seemed to have learned and work past his. Great job Albert. Really proud of how far you've come.
I was curious to see what would happen if he came back, was not disappointed. Actually, I’m very proud of him! He learned his mistakes, owned up to them, and worked hard on making himself become a better person than the person he was when he dun goofed. Good job, Albert!
Although what he did was inexcusable, I respect his courage to step, admit his mistakes, and look forward.
Jesus.. so much work went into this video.. just not somebody crying in a sweatshirt.. didint even know about the drama but every little hint etc was just beautiful, amazing video.   Good luck in the future, if your future projects will look like this concider me a subscriber.   I really do believe in change of a person, since ive tried myself, its not easy, but you get there, one step at a time, and this video is one of those steps.
Albert i Hope you gET WELL
Best edited apology video 2020 so far
Lol thank god 😂 let’s move on from this “drama” the internet handles shit like a fucking freshman in high school
omg. this video is a masterpiece of edits. love the cuts and pacing. <3
Absolutely amazing Video and very inspirational, good that you're working on bettering yourself.
Welcome back mate ❤️
I forgive.
Wow... umm... hi... hope you doing well...
Glad to see you're back, man!
How did albert get cancelled? I know he cheated on lily but thats about, im confused because he said he fucked up his career? And forgive me for asking this but how does cheatimg on one person fucks up your entire life lol? Its not like any other severe cases like hashinshin or fedmyster or yellowpaco, those are a completely different story and they deserve to be cancelled. But cheating? Really? Even losing his job AND friends because of it? Seems a bit childish by everyone.
Wow kinda inspirational ngl
GO Albert Chang, I’m fucking rooting for you!
You done goofed it. Goofed it real real hard.
Yes, what albert did was wrong,but I believe and I believe in you, many people haven't move on yet from that incident, but many peopl have also forgiven you, and I am one of those people. We forgive you.
ALBERT!!!!!!!!! I’ve missed you!!!!! 😭😭😭  Wait I’m crying this was beautiful 😭😭😭
I dislike the certainty when he speaks of himself but I feel the same way when I talk
wait albert is chinese?
kinda weird but What keyboard do you use? It looks good
Let’s be real here this is a genuine apology video. You can see the date on his phone saying “February”. Unlike any other people who made their apology video with messy hair looking hella depressed, Albert took his time and perfected it. Welcome back Albert
I've recently begun taking a "understanding film" class and I'm overwhelmingly astonished by your work! Mistakes happen. Arguably that's what makes us human and while hate is everlasting, so is your potential to evolve and improve. I can relate to a lot of the points made in this video as I'd also fucked up in recent times, had my grandmother pass, and begun my self development journey. As you stated, it is most important to learn to forgive yourself rather than letting the perception of others consume you. Ultimately, you are you and so long as you stay true to your fundamental beliefs, you will grow. Welcome back and let's improve together :3
after watching the stream today, can't help but feel bad for Albert.  even though lily said not to give hate the internet keeps providing.   looking forward to more streams <3
Good vid
Welcome back Albert.. it's okay everyone make mistake... The past is past.. at least you know you're wrong and you healing ♥️
Shiiii bro
Albert, this video was amazing. I do believe that you are stepping in to become a better person, I can't say the same for what others think, but I can wish you good luck!
I genuinely hope you can come out of this as a better person.
Bro, i missed you so much
It’s alright bro. You admit your mistake. You are recovering from it. Everyone make a mistake. We will still support you. You are a nice guy deep down, we all know it. ❤️
It is ok Albert. You are very brave to make a comeback. And that is what is important.  Your music is what is important. You have a purpose and mission. Just do it. I count amongst my friends  drug addicts,  all of them  rejected by society, their families. My job and my life is caring for the rejected and the broken. You will be hero to many with this video. Smash it mate. And if you can please like this podcast created by my very special boy. A broken dude but so good in front of his microphone. Thank you.  www.perthcitymusic.com
Now this, this is growth and that’s anyone should’ve hoped for you! Welcome back, I hope you can spread your smile and newfound appreciation of life to the people who look up to you! Life is about learning, you’ve done just that. This right here, this guy can become a real role model :)
Glad you're back Albert. ✅ I started watching your  violin videos with Tiffany your sister since 2016. 😊 💜 I almost cried watching this.😭 You're one great musician and film maker. Even if you hit the rockbottom, the only way is up now!😁⬆️ Stay strong, Albert! 📨 From Lovely, 📍Philippines🇵🇭
ForsenCD the boy is baaaack
hey man do what you need to to get back on track
Im just gonna start off by saying that I would never cancel you because I grew to like both you and lily very much. So it disappointed me to hear what had happened. But with that said, this video was really eye opening for me and I wanna say thank you for sharing. You could have been very private about your feelings but being open and vulnerable to the internet is really powerful right now. I really think you are changing for the better Albert and I am very happy you are back. I hope you are able to love yourself the way you want to. Welcome back !
besides all the other shit  holy dayum the editing is SO GOOD i want to learn how tf to do this
the video was great!!
good luck
I subbed for the music vids.  Had to google what happened.  Time will heal wounds. Memories last a lifetime.   It was a costly lesson but youll rise again.
Albert your an inspiration, pls don’t give up and keep grinding.
Avacadopeeled (Sarah Lee) likely making a similar video like she copied his apology.
Congratulations on seeking help, working towards your goals and NEVER giving up on becoming something greater. I think I can safely speak for all of your supporters when I say that we are incredibly proud of you and cannot wait to engage with your projects in the future! Everyone is flawed, no one is perfect, but we can all be compassionate and work towards the greater good. Welcome back Albert
Yo the editing and filmmaking in this vid was amazing dude  finally something good happened in 2020 I look forward to your content
516k people were waiting for a redemption I think you got it
I’m glad you’re admitting your mistakes and moving on, it’s nice to see people who even when their entire career was destroyed they can pick themselves up. Although I don’t personally like judging anyone, I appreciate people who take a step.
This could be turned into a anime story about Alberts life...
This video made me cry... you are so strong Albert for keep walking forward to be the man you want to be. And believe be, you will make your grandma really happy one day!!!!
頑張って
At the end of the day, we're all human. Mistakes, are just a part of life. We all can relate to him on a greater level than some can realize, and forgiveness is earned, just as respect is. Not only have you inspired yourself to change, but others as well, just by speaking about the struggle to. What always will matter most, is changing for yourself. Learn from your mistakes, not just Albert, but everyone else that may read this in the future.
My take away from this was that, that dog probably would have had the same fate as yeast boy
Make sure not to overshare on stream. We are not entitled to knowing about what happened, your feelings, or how you feel about recent events.
those bigshot youtubers in the beauty community should take notes from this
moral of the story is you can do a lot of good in the world but it only takes 1 mistake for it to define you and this shouldnt be the case, even though you did mess up really REALLY bad im glad you are safe and moving on to better yourself
thank you for coming back Albert
Back from the dead
yo glad to see you back... we know its been hard and its gonna continue to be hard, people are gonna keep bringing up the past, but you are so strong for just getting back on your feet. give yourself time and space, yes its been a year but healing can be a lifelong process. keep pursuing your happiness and success in your own definition. from a fellow human who makes mistakes to another, i wish you the best in this life.
just keep your chin up! fighting for your own sake God Bless You
Honestly after what Fed did, this guy seems alright lmao
This video is for very good for everyone wanting to keep up, awesome work on the video, and welcome back.
Welcome back
5:31 that drunk elephant really distracted me
The video production is so amazing and the storytelling behind it is amazing!
Background music at 5:10 please...
I don't get the dislikes... I can't see how he could have made this vid better, we all have to move on, even lily did...
Epic
It doesnt look like you ate much
Now do better
I am fellow representative of the comfiest channel on youtube and twitch and all I can say is. Welcome Back Albert, hope you're doing well.  If you see any negative comments about Albert then know that they are not a part of the comfy squad and should be left to rot in their own hate and ignorance, thank you.
this video is just... incredible. you're so talented, welcome back!
I started watching OTV 2 months before what happened. I thought of you as a pice of shit. But I see you grown and I hope you find inner peace.
I'm prolly just going to be another comment but I'm glad you're back. Everyone makes mistakes. Things just get a lot worse when many people you don't even personally know are stomping and beating you for it. You took the time to heal <3. Thank you for sharing your experiences, especially the struggles that many refuse to acknowledge. I may not understand what you went through the past year, I'm sorry if it might be the most depressing time, but you're now embracing yourself - your very soul. That's what's going to matter now. My condolences to you and your family. I'm sure your grandma will always be proud of you. This was an amazing piece - excellent work. I look forward to seeing more contents. Again, WELCOME BACK ALBERT!
I actually found out about this from Lily's stream. when IT happened, I had just started to watch, I fell in love with you, your content, and your friends. when I had found out I was really hurt for Lily and mad at you, and I didn't want to forgive you. but over the past few months, I've just been remembering the past and wondering how you were, and hoping that you changed. I'm glad you're back. And I'm glad you changed
please don’t hate on him. in lily’s stream, she said that she would not like any of the fans to hate and attack albert. they’re on good terms and she wishes him the best of luck.
Yo dead ass in tears :) welcome back brother
To be honest, I’m glad there will be a new Albert. It’s nice to see and Albert who is more Albert. There has been a major change in a year and I respect that
I was waiting for Albert to come back since he got canceled. I believe everyone makes mistakes and i liked what albert did. Its selfish of me but i missed his content
I feel that they have already forgiven him its just they are not ready to have him again and their trust won't be easy to get but don't give up instead rise up and don't do the same mistakes you did and live happily and live how you want to 😁 (Sorry my english is bad)
You did a really messed up thing and its good that you realised that and learned from your mistake it will be a long process till you gain everyone's trust again you'll never have the same fanbase you used to and some people hate you but out of respect for who you used to be before everything happened ill support you throughout the journey👍
Honestly I wasn’t there to be a movie just form how well this was produced
God damn that was well made.
I glad you change chang
This is a wonderful step for anyone. As someone who's starting a journey of self-care, It's inspiring to see one of my favorite content creators being open about the same thing. I hope your journey is a fulfilling one and can't wait to see what you have coming. Also, I see you flexing that M100 ~ tasteful! Can't wait to see what 2021 has for you!
I get it, you've done enough and personally i think it'd be cool too see you make more content before this i had no personal opinion on you other than the knowledge of what happened, but with this video i see what kinda person you are and i think you deserve to do what you love :)
Your mistakes drive you. Don't let them weigh you down!
We all fuck up at some point in life. It’s a lesson we learn to make us stronger as a person. We may not have our same routines and same people in our lives anymore. But that’s okay. That’s how we learn to start over again and become better. I’m really glad you’re back, Albert. I look forward to seeing your future projects you have in hold.
I can't focus on thr content cause of the filmic quality. Just wow.
ITS LITT!!!!
Man finally Albert's back. I hated seeing the internet rubbing mountains of salt into his wounds I mean it really isn't the internet's job to go the extra mile to straight up abused people like that
some people on the internet act so weird, they act like they never did wrong or something bad, or did any mistake at all... so I guess Albert made this for them... for the judgemental assholes that used to tell him over and over again how low of a person he is(or even worse) for doing what he did... cheat on someone they didn't even knew or really care about...
What's up Doc
we all love a redemption song my friend... just keep working on self.... if people never forgive you f them ... this one mistake does not define your lifelong journey.... this too shall pass
lol, the number of people writing essays in the comment. Anyway, cool edit.
I think it's brave to own up to your mistakes, especially on a public platform. I hope you find inner peace one day and learn from your mistakes because, as you said, mistakes don't define you, and there are more important things to pursue in life than constant self-deprecation and hatred.
had to watch this withot anyone reacting, chat is just WAY too toxic
I think. You will be okay. And it will be okay. You handled it good.
anyone know the names of the songs he used throughout this video? the last song was very soothing and fit well with his story I think.
i like the video and it's very well made. it made me tear up too. one thing i want to know from him is how him monetizing his passions lead to somehow him deciding to cheat on lily? is the reasoning he couldn't say no when another woman propositioned him? or was it like the lack of joy he was getting from work was compensated with an illicit relationship. asking for this much detail is probably an invasion of privacy, it's just some apologies that don't address the very core of what a person did explicitly rub me the wrong way a little.
And that's what we call emosheenl maniplatin
this was great. although this doesn’t excuse your actions, it’s good that you’re changing. similar to a wongfu video. glad to see what’s coming.
Cheating is not that big of a deal to ruin someone’s life over. They weren’t even married. Equivalent to high schoolers dating each other. Nosy ass people
( ^-^)
Welcome back Albert! For the greatest I hope!
You won't receive forgiveness but you will receive a bit of acceptance and respect. I hope you will continue doing YouTube and I hope you will somewhat be back on track.
I have to be real. You are playing it off as a mistake. I do not think this was a mistake, you were just upset when caught. At the time. However now that you've reflected on the past you realized that the choices you made were not good. You have grown as a human. Thats the part you should take away....Not apologize for a  mistake that wasnt actually a mistake, but a choice. you knew what you were doing when it was happening was wrong. Hope you take this chance to grow yourself and plan for a better future. Here to support you through healing.
forsenCD
This is a million times better than any apologies video I ever saw
hope you've changed
Albert, you messed up. But at the very least it looks like you have actually taken time to try and improve yourself and I hope you actually mean it because I have hope that you will come back better.
same but without the part where u find yourslef new and start liking yourself xD
This is very inspiring 👍 I'm sure we all here will always be here to support this channel
Very good work this Video is amazing
hey, I admired you for so long. I hope you actually become a better man. Welcome back.
Welcome back to the champions club forsenCD
Well for an apology video, the level of editing and effort put into it is S tier.
This isnt about forgiveness. But, I forgive Albert. He really tried. I hope he does learn to forgive himself. He's doing his best and trying, and honestly for a lot of people that's enough. He can't erase the hurt, but he can try to amend what was broken. And that's what matters the most.  Thank you for sharing albert. And welcome back.
0:53 hit hard...  people make mistakes...  the only difference is your worth...  thats what made things worst...  hope you can reconnect with OTV...
hey lets make a disney movie and pretend all the shit you've done didn't even happen
Shameless, once an offender, u gotta put him on the registry.
👌
Homie really survived the gulag
It's good to see you back.
your back, don't worry.
0:52 lily flower, it's a nice touch
People make mistakes man, not everyone is going to forgive you. I think as long as you acknowledge your mistakes and address them, and apologize for what you've done is all that matters man. Not everyone is perfect, everyone makes mistakes. Hang in there man, all you can do at this point is to move on from it and learn from your mistakes man.   The cinematography in this video was so good, and the story board to tell your story was phenomenal. Keep up the great work, we'll all be here to watch you better yourself.
keep your head up albert, you'll get there
7:11 sign says liberty. Hmm
woah i’m a net otv fan and i just came from finding out abt this tea, this is one apology and self reflection video. lowkey motivates me to get my life together.
Grow well.
The Hardest thing in life is recognizing your flaws and mistakes and acknowledging them and do your best to move forward.
Not gonna lie. I hate what you did but, yeah, you're right. Change is life-long. Good luck, man.
Lily has moved on and is doing better than ever before, and I'm certainly not going to hold a grudge for her. It's not my place to do so.
This is so sad. T^T  This is not an apology video. This is his real feelings. :<
It's ok to fuck up once in a while.... We aren't perfect so the only thing we can do is accept our mistakes so Albert if you're reading this it's ok to fuck up we all fucked up at least once and awhile this is a message to everyone..... It doesn't mean that you failed once you give up...... You stand up and recover from what you done it's never to late to change.....
❤️
After seeing this makes me want to see a therapist as well.....by the way, welcome back Albert!
God damn this is really good.
People think its good to shit on a person that they dont know wow so cool ur a cool kid dude
Albert: I wasn’t that good at the violin Also Albert: Doing vibrato at the age of six
I wish you the best. I hope things go well for you. You helped me see a different and new view
This is the effects of the Codependency Syndrome man
Did you catch up with fed?
wow
Les go squid squad : p also nice keeb man what switches Albert?
All the best Albert!
You were never “cancelled”. As a content creator you were competing for attention on the Internet, and people found you so abhorrent that they decided to take their business elsewhere. Get over it.
Honestly it's great he's trying. But this video format doesn't help him. But it's a great netflix pilot.
Fun fact: the street he is running on in the video is Liberty Hill.
Nobody talking about how the street  he is running on is Liberty Hill??!?!
7:40 Liberty Hill Street
This vid made me subscribe
YES! finally
In my opinion, seeing a scarred but new Albert is so much better than never seeing Albert.
I can just dream the day Albert is back friends with OTV and Fed becomes a better person and Joins OTV again
Honestly, people need to shut the fuck up about the lily and albert thing, its such old news. It was a year ago, shit changed. Both sides became better. Both had good outcomes, especially with Lily with michael and all that stuff. And if you’re still salty about it, then just drop all of your friends and leave your family cause everyone fucks up. And apparently you can only be around perfect angels who does nothing wrong and I can say Every single person around you isn’t perfect as you think they are, they fuck up or going to fuck up. And if you forgive them or make amends. Then that makes you a piece of shit also. And thats a fact if you like it or not. And not saying to forgive albert, just don’t fuckin give a shit about it.
He is not a superhero , if you guys still blame him just see your self you are human and albert is human too , human can make a mistake sometimes.
No one can do more than be the person they always wished they were. For most people that means finding the wrong way, hitting the bottom, turning around and starting over. You are doing that for yourself. If nothing else comes of it, you are doing what everyone should have started doing ages ago. You will reach a point one day where you can forgive your own mistakes because you will have learned from them and grown from them. No one but you is ever going to know that day came and went. If you are honestly trying to be who you wished you were, then you have support from those who have always loved what you do and enjoyed sharing that journey.   There will be haters; this is the internet. Never let others define you with their limitations. Good luck Albert.
2:40 bojack horseman is a nice touch. Your strive to recover is extremely admirable and brave!
I feel so bad for content creators. I just spent an hour reading comments on reaction videos and such and boy do people have their opinions. No matter what you do there will always be people saying unimaginable, horrible things. This video was honestly probably the best thing he could possibly do. How people don’t see that I will never understand. Please remember to be nice everyone!
idk they way he sounds his voice sounds like something that isnt trustworthy  but not my problem and personally dont care for him as he doesnt for me either interesting nonetheless i hope you do better and get better
LETS FUCKING GO I MISSED YOU ALBERT!!!
Things happen, many more will happen, the good can you be working on you and not judging someone else's mistakes/growth.   Point fingers is easy.
Although I am a new guy of offline tv community ,i can still see Albert also did tons of good thing in offline tv  And I think it's the time to forgive Albert and let him to shine (The quality of this video is really good)
This is so fucking good. I am still kind of mad at you but I love this video. Be strong and take care :3
dude i needed to hear this so badly rn... im in a really fucked up place in my left... rock bottom if you will and its everything to hear someone elses prespective
bruh, you cheated on a chick, it's not that serious. you can be with as many people as you want to try to find the right one, it's not selfish, it's just logical. you're not committed until you sign a paper with 2 witnesses, another person, and a justice of the peace. honestly disgusted with how many idiots think this is such a big deal when it literally happens every day, all around the world, in every country, and has happened since the dawn of people.
I’m not happy with what Albert has done but I’m inclined to believe that he will be a better person
Don't let your mistakes define you.
Bro ignore all of the negative things around you ok? Smile and say this to yourself that i can change and i can do it
Honesty is the most important virtue. This video, it shows good evidence of understanding that.   I wish you well, Albert Chang. May growth find you.
This is a good apology, if it can even be considered as such. I hope it shall be proven reliable, for that'd be a good honor to a good video.
This is by far the best apology for any youtuber/streamer I've ever seen. The attention to detail, the tasteful acknowledgement of wrong doings, and actually apologizing for his actions and not for getting caught. I started watching the group when the situation was at it's climax so I didn't see much of Albert, but seeing this makes me hopeful for his future. I may not subscribe and may not agree with what you did, but I see that you've grown and your going forward accepting your faults in the process. Very impressive for youtube apology standards.
Do what you want to do man, people grow. People make mistakes. If others don't accept that then they have their own unresolved issues. Im not a Christian man but I do believe "he who cast the first stone shall have no sin of their own" is correct. The ones judging you so harshly have done their own mistakes. So fudge them and live a good life.
good to hear mate
I feel the sincerity in your video. I hope that it is true. I am willing to trust you once again.
albieeeeee
Ah man the production quality is so good happy too see you back!
Poor Violin chan Stay strong bud
Stay strong my guy
it probably took the whole 11 months to edit this masterpiece
What happened? What did he do?
I almost cried when i saw the lily😢😭
It’s all what makes a life for a person, whether it’s good or bad,  Still, it’s good to have you back Albert
I'm simply crying, i feel the same way.
welcome back albert <3
i wish offlinetv just calls you and says "come back albert, its okay" :'>
If people can rewatch a man who recorded a D**d B*dy I believe we can give albert a chance to regain what he lost. I don't know much about albert and what liberty really was but I believe that one day he must move on to a better future.
I really think he made a mistake before and i still now, but I think he really changed. He became more wise, and more importantly, more happy. I believe in you Albert, may the future be with you!
Welcome back Albert! You seem to be doing well... and that is good. I accept your apology like what everyone else should. I know that for some people it might be harder for them to accept, but I’m glad your back!
Albert think he big bad don't he?? I bet fed could beat you up and make a better video than you! fed more big bad than you!
probably sleeping with his therapist too
he's trying to be better, and i'm hoping he will be.
once a cheater always a cheater
i’m so happy he’s back and okay. i thought he was a piece of shit at the time of all the drama and felt bad for everyone involved. when he didn’t upload for those long months i got worried because i was still a fan. now that he’s back i think he’s actually changed is healed and i’m so happy for him and everyone else! :)
I have recently felt very down about life as a whole and can't find true happiness,  this video connects really deeply with me as i've been through many of these things myself. Thank you for making this video as it gives me tears everytime I watch this video. "Mistakes aren't what ultimately define you, it's what you do after you make them..." "So, when you search my name in the future, may the person you find... be the person I resolve to become..." Thank you Albert for everything
I, alongside others, are really proud of you Albert! Its great to see you grow and come out with this video, which was beautifully, explaining where you stand and your future. Everybody makes mistakes, and deserve a second chance. You have my full support
You know what? I needed this. Thank you Albert, "mistakes dont define who you are, its what you do after". Let's get better together!
I fucking cried?
I never hated Albert for what he did to Lily I was just super disappointed when I heard. Though I guess I never really starting watching otv shit until like 2 months before it  happened, however I still binge watched a lot of their shit. So I was still super fucking disappointed when I found out.  Same with the fed shit that happened not to long ago, super disappointed and I really expected better. Though I say I am super disappointed in the two what I want is to know that they're changing for the better, and to actually get a video from Albert talking about this is really nice. (Would like one from Fed to but that probably wont happen for a bit, he probably still needs to come to terms with everything.) So to all the people who just joined to dislike the video I say just try to give it a chance, I know you guys are probably still really upset at what happened a year ago, but I say that he should get the opportunity to try and redeem himself.
I like how this video was made. I am still kinda scared though for if he starts streaming, I feel like there will be a lot of toxicity, maybe even his chat trying to get him to watch clips of Lily and Michael
I’m really glad Albert is coming back i have always supported him and I know is still a pretty cool guy. I honestly have been waiting for you to come back for a while and I’m really happy that u did come back hope ur doing good.
It's okay Albert
strong video
Humans do mistakes it's not something bad it's something basic of life! You discovered yourself and you were looking too high at the moment, I hope your life as a person and in your "career" will improve and you will get rid of your past! Good luck I'll be there to look at your content!!
your back albert :)
The only genuine apology video on YouTube, also moet creative. Welcome back dude , i was sure a  smart person like ur self will know how to learn from his mistake.
Damn. Good thing he's getting a therapist for all the mental anguish he suffered from getting cheated on... Oh wait...
To be fair, Lily is the one who always puts other people's needs before her own. Not here to hate, Albert is obviously talented but puts his energy into the wrong things. I won't support him anymore bc I don't think he gets to be selfish twice in a row here.
Holy shit thats a really good video, welcome back
I thought he was going to recreate the video: “Hey it’s been a while I’ve missed you...”
This video was incredible. Start to finish, the composition of it all, the fluidity - sound design and story, holy shit. I usually have a really hard time focussing on one video for too long but i was completely absorbed into this, literally speechless. I'm really glad you decided to come back.
Show the world what you learned
I tend to breakup before going for another girl. I dont know the statistics but i think the number is very high when it comes to cheating regardless are you a guy or a girl. So there is nothing special about to make fuss and thinking that you are a bad person. Chin up.
Good job man
We all make mistakes.....welcome back and keep it up.
8:51 Is That Kyle Landry?
Honestly this video is a masterpiece, what you did was wrong, However you went through a lot... pain, suffering, depression. But you are a intelectual person, you realize what was wrong with you, and tried to make a change, you work really REALLY HARD, maybe thinking if you worked that hard you might get the slightly chance of being forgiven and putting all those emotions you had in a single video is truly amazing. Albert i really never liked nor hated you I just knew you because of all of this drama. Im no one to say if you should be forgiven or not. But i truly hope some people forgives you. Thanks for making this video, people made mistakes A LOT, everyone watching this video had atleast made one mistake. People usually think their entires lifes are over when they fuck up and most of them just gave up... But this video had shown us that people can change. CHANGE CAN BE MADE, everyone can change if effort and deep thinking is made, I really think this video will help a lot of people too, so even if you fucked up and no one forgives you, you've already made a lot of good thanks to this video. I really hope you get what you want, I really hope people will eventually forgive you, much love.
This is better than an apology. This is change. I've resubscribed, and look forward to seeing what you have in store for us :)
Good for you man :D
I will agree you haven’t made the best choices but I hate the fact that your bad choices got splashed all over the internet. Your whole situation should’ve been dealt with privately, but I’m so glad you used this time to work on yourself. Life is too short and I hope I see you in trending one day.
im happy you are getting better i hope to see more of you soon
I am so proud of you! I wish you the best of luck on this journey 💕
Always knew u had no motivation
Without context, this is a beautiful, jaw-dropping, true to the creator, work of art.  With the context, this is a heartfelt message, by a humbled man that bows down to his past and experience in gratitude, and shows the audience no tricks whilst doing so.  Not even because I had been a fan before all that happened, but I'm really happy that Albert chose to come back, and that he has grown from what he did and what happened. This video is the product of and screams raw talent, and I look forward, as always, to what "sleightlymusical" has in store next.
This is a good video, and it's obvious that a lot of work went into it. You talked about a lot of things you realised and worked on, many of which I should be morr aware aswell. So in a way I thank you, maybe this video is the motivation I need to begin my own journey.
I'm glad you're back
Dang....!! He got cheated or something ??
with Albert being depressed for almost all his life and all the hate he got must have been like hell I feel bad for Albert even him cheating on lily that’s what started all this I’m happy for Albert that he is back on his feet again
People who don’t understand this videos concept are brain dead
Welcome back, missed you bro.
Welcome back
Welcome back.
this video wasnt for you guys in the first place. it’s for him
Almost made me cry
Keep going glad to see u
I think you have definitely made a step in the right direction. Recognizing your own faults and failures is easy, acting on improving yourself so they don't happen again takes strength. If you read this Albert I think you are at the start of a new chapter in your life journey and from what you've said I think you understand better than anyone how much of an uphill trek you will be taking, but the goal at the end is worth it. Do I forgive you for the stuff you did, no; because that is not my right as just a fan/viewer, it is up to you and those who were affected. Do I think you are on the way to redeeming yourself, very much so. Good luck, I look forward to the amazing stuff you will do!  PS. Loved the symbolism in the video, especially the flowers ^.^
This is quite emotional for me. I am very glad that your doing well now albert
I see a piano and a melodica... Hmmm.
Man when i heard about what happened between you and yknow who, i was quite criticizing, i believed that people couldn't change, that they'll make the same mistakes...but after watching this, I believe that change is possible. If you put your mind to it, and geniunely want to change yourself, then you will. The past shouldn't define us at all, but rather, it is what shapes us into being the person we are today, for better or for worse. Honestly man, i wish the best of luck for you, i'm glad that you're getting better now and i hope that soon, your career will start to flourish again. I know that not everyone will forgive you, some will continue to hate either way. Even so, remember that there are still people out there, that have already forgiven you, and wish for you to get better. People like me.
Countless random people have done this shit too the only  difference between them and Albert is he's well known and they're just random people. I'm not saying what he did was right but who tf in their right mind would tell him to kill himself? That is one toxic fanbase.
Just as I imagined it would happen. Welcome back. You're still (a champion).
Dammit even if it’s not a music video, his videos still feel like high quality 😍
I guess all people can have a second chance
Probably run out of cash, and looking for a way to make a quick buck
You are a good person  You are a good person You are a good person  You are a good person  You are a good person  You are a good person  You are a good person  You are a good person  You are a good person  You are a good person
I hope all works out for you albert. The internet gave you enough shit (me included) , its time to lead as a good example and show everyone you changed. Good luck!
oh, the flower
Honestly, I'm glad he's doing well. Lily's doing well too, so there's nothing to be mad about anymore
Finally he realised, the copy paste bullshit apology on twitter is not enough lol
It makes me so sad seeing xQc talk mess about this video like its an apology. This is clearly him just sharing what he's been up too, he already gave his apology on twitter like a good year ago.
Bravo Albert, tu ne me comprendras certainement pas, mais je souhaite te féliciter pour cette vidéo. J'espère un jour voir ce génie moderne transformée qui a su nous faire vivre tant d'émotions. Sache que tu sais toujours le faire, si ce n'est mieux. Tu as fait un beau chemin jusque-là, la route qu'il te reste sera sans doute hardu mais je te souhaite de la franchir. Bravo encore pour cette pépite de sincérité. Courage pour la suite !
I'm really happy to see this humble Albert again. When I found your channel several years ago I was impressed with your creativity and approachable feeling. Over the years though, it seemed like you'd grown a bit more distant. I have no idea about the back story, but after the pain and sorrow, I think it can be a very good thing when we hit those reset moments. I'm glad to see that you've thought it through well, and are taking steps to get back on your feet.  I know it probably sounds weird, coming from someone you don't know, but I love you man, and whatever you choose to do, I wish you the best.
You should have just made an another Video like nothing bad has happened because that is exactly the situation. If this wasn’t made for money and for recognition then I don’t know why it was made for. Jeez, let us know if you are having diarrhea so we can throw our two cents.
I felt really bitter looking back at your old videos back then after everything happened, just like everyone else or at least a lot of people I was really sad, disappointed in what happened. But with this video, I have come to respect your growth. There’s not always a happy ending for everyone.. but I think that this truly was the best way of doing things after what had happened. Just like other cases, we can’t forget them but what we can do is acknowledge them and grow from it. I hope more people learn to understand each other.
I think it's fairly inspiring to see a creator do something like this. It's not necessarily an apology, but a mixture of that and a redemption to himself. Creators today think that when they fuck up, they have to apologize and acknowledge that they were wrong before they can normally move on without showing that selfishness to go back into content creation to make their living again. I think what albert did was heinous and despicable but what's important is that he used that to become not a better person (we don't know that) but a different person (hopefully). It's one thing to apologize for your mistakes, it's another to publicize that apology, and it is an inspiring thing to tell the world the real reason for their apology is not to prove to the world that they are going to change, but to tell the world that they are ultimately selfish. I think the best takeaway from this is what albert said in the beginning of this video. "Mistakes don't define you, it's what you do after them." And the fact that things that he did after the mistake that cancelled his whole career was for himself, really is epitome of humanity.
WELCOME BACK ALBERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
He used the platform that was given to him by people he trusted to be a complete terrible person. I still think he’s a socio path that’s going to take advantage of more people, on the same fucked up wavelength as Fed. These creators that had TRUST/power abused it. Only came to this video to comment this. Hope he actually got therapy if not nothing has changed. He should go on Dr. K he can really out an Ass/from a reformed/from an incel.
This is a beautifully constructed video. I’m happy you are feeling healthy enough to even touch the internet again. I hope one day you will be able to google yourself and see the man your grandma saw.
You’re such and asshole to make me kinda like you again. Great vid and I wish you the best of luck
Good video
Wait what did he do? I've googled it and all i can find is he raged a bit in chat and showed gorillas having sex? is the world this pathetic they cancel someone over this and he has to make this big ass apology video for doing something most gamers do every day? someone please explain what he did that was soo bad?
ok but who asked
Welcome back!!!
Whats that song playing when he started burning stuff 5:10
Life doesn’t seem the same without you many of us have missed you I hope that you’ll find happiness in your future and do what you love not what people want you to do.
I'm glad both parties have found happiness in their own ways
Your past cannot be changed.  But your video has a good message to redemption from being broken to being happy
I dont think I've ever seen such a comeback from a big mistake online.. This video seems really genuine and I cant imagine how difficult it was for Albert to get to post this. We all fuck up sometimes and we all know he made a BIG mistake but can you even imagine the difference between making a big mistake and making it in front of the internet? I dont think I'd be able to deal with it...
I hope you achive what you desire for
Yooo tbh the cinematography soo damn lit.. great job dude.. you are a good person keep it up and do not bother what others think about you just live your life at its best
Welcome back, hope you change alot
Albert i now what your favorite Movie is after watching this Video. Let me guess...oh i now American Psycho👍
tbh it feels like a publicity stunt to promote himself
You are a SOCIOPATH you get no sympathy! The entire Video you trying to make us feel bad for you. Not once did you say sorry or talked about how was it wrong to do what you did. Not once...JESUS
Welcome back albert, do your best to gain what you did its wrong
Lol bye
Let get this straight. I don’t have to like you to enjoy your music. I don’t believe on cancel culture. I see content in a different light. So get your Paganini Jacky Chan ass back to making videos.
As somebody who had Depressions, i have to say you disgust me. You pulling that Mental illness Card to justify your Actions🤢
So everytime you cheaters get caught you gonna do this and say that your guys are Mentally ill i see i see.
this guy got more hate than fed lmao
Oh by the way deleting my Comments wont change the fact you cheated you coward 🤣 you are a joke!
Welcome Back, i'm glad you see a therapist.   And for the ones reading this. Cancel culture sucks, people can learn and grow up. We love both who was onvolved on this... situation, and i Really love Lily, but she is fine now, making her life and albert have the oportunity to do the same.  idk if i say this well, my english is not so good, but i'm trying to use my words and not a translator, because is what i feel.
Mykull > Albert
Your simps might come to your defense but i wont.
You should be ashamed of your self! Here is a Story from my Childhood now feel sorry for me 🤢 you make me sick..a big Content Creator helps you and you betray her. And then you what want us to forgive you? Because you made a 11 min Video talking about your hard life? I had the same Parents to, who would push me to the edge, so dont give me that. I don't feel sorry for you. You cheated on a really sweet Girl. But hey guess what she is gonna have trust issues now, thanks to you good on you 👍you feel sorry huh. Prof it, that you changed. Then we'll talk about you redeeming your self. This Video just scrams I DID NOTHING WRONG.
Albert I am so proud of you coming back and I appreciate that you never gave in.
"I started sleeping 8 hours a day." Man I thought that was normal....
Wow it’s Albie :) can’t wait to see you back in action, I knew you from offline and after what happened, I listened to some music and it was good, if you make more content I will be there to watch it
You will reach "it" again someday.
Why is everyone so against him putting effort into an apology video? I swear everyone can never be satisfied.
This video is amazing. Not only as a genuine apology that shows growth, but as a film and work of art. I've recently gotten into filmaking, and seeing such a well shot and well done video, with actual meaning behind it is amazing. Keep up the great work man.
Bro just make contant and we will watch. Welcome back😊
Ayyeee whassup albert welcome backkk
the thing is, people that makes mistakes needs help not hate. i wish this thought can be normalized
If this is a video for yourself then why did you publish it on a public platform? Genuinely curious
Come on guys he is not a bad person at all. Plus he's filming skills are lit
Would have been better if he just recorded himself trying to say hello and trying to be friends again to lily and offline tv not this cinema style video about his life
Is there any songs in this video that can be found somewhere else?
Thank you so much for this, Albert. It was nice to see your work again. I hope everything works out well for you <3
Still can't forget what you done, but hey welcome back :)
once ur ready ill be here buddy
Thank you for being strong Albie, thank you for doing your very best. Thank you for being better. We love you and I genuinely believe that we'll meet again one day. Best of luck on your journey buddy. God bless you.
*Albert has left the champions club*
Say what you will about the guy  but his editing skills are daaammm good
You say your a shitty artist but this gave me very much Wes Anderson vibes. Cant wait to see what else you will do.
Good. Day. Sir.
Im gonna give my honest opinion on the video. No matter how well and beautifully crafted the video, I, and obviously others, still will have resentment(hate). What i absolutely love, however, is your crazy good, non-cliche approach to fixing yourself. Ill give you respect for that. Cy@
I think the saddest and cringiest part of this video is the little kids spamming forsencd under JVNA's comment thinking it's Sarah. Like ok buddy, you're already braindamaged saying that classic "this didn't age well" or "welcome to the champion club" after 10 months. When you crit the wrong person, wow I lose all respect for you even through all the garbage Lily had to go through. You help no one, you exploit people's weaknesses and shame, and no matter if they did the same, its not right. Shut up. You're not funny anymore. Just shut up.
He learned how to live From a girl who was going to die.
Youtube comments were real thoughtful and seemed like everyone who typed it has a brain, but fucking twitter? jesus christ it’s a shit show
high quality shit right here. couldn't care less about what you do or what you did but the video was amazing. yea and i also stan lily and mykull
Wait who?
This sounds very "I'm 14 and this is deep."
Nice vid man, welcome back!
The whole breakup drama only lasted 3 months for me prior to when it happened, hell i even forgot why i was infuriated in the first place
WOW just fucking goosebumps, im speechless
We're all human beings we all get fucked up one day but to prove you're a person is to stand right back up. Good to have you back!
Why does this play like a movie
The guy cheated on a girlfriend, not exactly a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I never understood why he got so much heat over it. The internet blows small things way out of proportion. Good to see you back Albert, can’t wait to catch a stream.
WHEN HE SHOWED HIS GRANDMA I FUCKIN CRIED
You have my support
Hope the wound healed, and the scar isn't a reminder of pain, but a lesson to be better.
🔥🔥🔥I missed u broooo
People do mistakes. Move on. Let him live his life. If you don't want to support him then don't. And leave the people who will still be fans of him alone as well. He didn't kill anyone.
Stay strong, we all do mistakes :) . Happy to see your vid again :) .
We can get better albert it's nice to see you back
*this is kinda cool shot btw*
Everything happens for a reason Albert, even if you went down the wrong path initially, your path was designed for you to change. Whether that would be for the best or for the worse, it has changed the perspective of the old Albert I’m sure. And even though I don’t know you personally,  a human wanting to make amends with himself knows what’s it like to suffer. Things can only get better from rock bottom. Remember, Sympathy is on the surface, and empathy is on the inside. Believe in yourself and those close to you, and you will find peace no matter how many mistakes you make✌🏼. This goes for anybody.
I'm not going to lie when i saw this pop up in my subscription box i was a angry. I had always just sided with lily and after everything i heard i was disgusted by him and i now know i was wrong to think that. I used to make mistakes all the time big ones at that and i was always told mistakes happen but whenever someone else would make them it would anger me. Watching this video has actually really opened my mind about things. Its not my place to forgive Albert but i hope he can forgive himself and others hes hurt can forgive him as well because much like i've been told mistakes happen move on, make it twice though and its no longer a mistake. (also rip doggo)
I am glad you're doing okay and that you're working hard to change. Stay strong.
Is it just me or am I getting a bit of Mr. Robot vibes here? awesome video
Éxito carnal
I hope u feel better take care of ur self

Sorry, but for me, personally, cheating is UNFORGIVABLE. It's my personal pov, and the morals I carry within myself.  Good for you, you have your fans's support. :) I'll just do my best not to watch any video with your face in it. ;)
This isn’t an apology video. A lot of people in the comments are completely misconstruing the message of this video. The consensus wasn’t to shame “cancel culture” but to disprove the notion that people don’t change. Aside from the toxic side of it, cancel culture condemns your mistakes and doesn’t let you hide from it. He took this year, and he changed. Not just for everyone’s sake, but himself, too. This wasn’t an apology video, it was his reintroduction and even though most people don’t like what he’s done, we should celebrate the change. Mistakes don’t define us, not if we work towards bettering ourselves.
Redemption arc.
Damn
Best comeback video. Welcome back
This is probably the most well done 'I'm sorry" video.
I never really knew about albert back then and i just recently found out about what had happened and yeah it was a big mistake that he made. But I feel like he changed and man was social distancing before the pandemic. But the one reason why I am writing this comment is because of the symbolism in this vid.      Holy shit, this video's editing and symbolism used in this video was good
People make mistakes, we all make mistakes sometimes. There's nothing that will comes up really good from hating, bullying people really hard because of their mistakes, especially when the person that do involves with the problem have already forgiven and moved on. Because you'll never know how much and how long it affects them. There's no good thing from hating or holding a grudge to someone that we honestly don't really know their back stories. It's time for us to reflect and move on.  Welcome back Albert! Glad to see you back! Can't wait to see your next video! 🥰
dam compared to Twitter everyone here is more positive. That's good cuz I hate twitter. If you want to live happily just delete twitter.
Hey. I feel ya. It took me 7 yrs to overcome what I did to my ex. I am changing, healing, and growing stronger.
Just a reminder to all the ppl wondering.   Lily won't be responding to this video probably honestly I'm not sure but I don't think she will. It would only attract attention good and bad. And we don't want drama on this. Also another reminder  Lily wants everyone to stay comfy so don't start hating on Albert, you don't need to actually support him for Albert but more so for Lily. Lily has been through a lot as we know so I think she would just want everyone to just be comfy regarding Albert
This was honestly so inspirational and beautiful
Welcome back albert  We understand now. Thank you for telling us.
Im glad people stopped to some degree cancling people. that shit is toxic af and does nothing bad harm. glad you didn't let your mistake stop you from doing what you love man!
It’s still nice to have you back man
this be shot pre cool
this video is incredibly well produced dude, welcome back
Glad to see your making your way back to your feet. I used to watch and ask for advice from you. When what happened happened I was disappointed,  but I could also immediately tell you despised yourself as well.   You are working to rediscover yourself and your forging your own way forward. You may have lost, but you’ve started gaining. And honestly, that’s what i always hoped you would end up doing. Not trying to rebuild, but to start anew in your own way.
forsenCD ✌️ nice
I hate social media.
7:11 hit a lil different...
A very well made video
I know this is gonna get dislike bombed or deleted but I couldn't take him seriously after he said "I GOT CANCELLED."   There's a difference between being cancelled and facing a consequence for an action.  Now if someone stalked you called your employer every time you got a job or threatened you then that's being cancelled.  However the things you listed wasn't cancel culture.  Cancel culture is people who take that extra step from leaving mean comments and harass you and your family for a mistake you made. You admit you made a terrible mistake that cost you a lot then you go on to say in the same paragraph you got cancelled.  No you didn't you faced the consequences of your actions.  Imagine if Fedmyster made a video claiming he got cancelled because he was kicked out of offline TV for sexually harassing women.  People would be furious.  Not only that you said that stupid line FOUR TIMES.  The rest of the video is good and I'm glad you're taking better care of yourself but you need to realize that you weren't cancelled you faced a consequence.  One that was a pretty big one and you need to overcome.
A lot of people are still telling you to F off or something like that but I hope you grow as a better person, good luck on your journey
Now, this is cap. Check is league history bruh
Glad your back
Sorry but I will never forget what he did to Lily ಠ_ಠ , that's just my opinion
ALBERT LMAO WTF ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE
Even though what happened, happened. Things happen, keep your head up and move forward. Thank you though, even thought this was meant for yourself. It helped me self reflect so I can also better myself. A bunch of others and myself will be waiting patiently for you to start your journey again Albert. <3
I think Lily would want you to be the best you can be and I support that too. Good luck Albert, make this count.
Welcome back fella, wish you a good and steady improvment on becoming who you wanna be
Sure people screw up, but the people who don't give people second chances are even worse. We've all been given these second chances and love it when they come our way, so give others a second chance because they would give you one as well.
This short film is setting a good example
This is just proof that cancel culture utterly destroys people and those around them,  I honestly wish their was more people that understood when and when not to give an opinion on something. Albert is strong for doing this and putting himself out there even when he knows that he'll get unjustified hate. <3
Albert it's okay. I think doing what you want to do i important, and in time you will learn to do what you love. I will always support you and am happy that ur back.
Bruh, how much money wasted on this? I don't need a Wes Anderson mini movie.  Just be you and show the people what you want bro.
This is one of the best videos I’ve ever watched. Keep ya head up
i ont care if he chated ill still watch his content
To be honest, I don't know why people hate Albert so much in the first place. Sure he completely f'ed up from his mistake but I think the biggest problem is us as the viewers. I think we as the viewers were being more of a douche than Albert was. One of the main reasons why Albert stayed in seclusion for a long time is because of the comments and posts people made to smite down Albert. If this is your first time seeing a person cheat another person, then I'm sad to tell you that you are diagnosed with a medical condition called "living under a rock". It is more unacceptable on how the media reacted to something that we should have no say over than what Albert did. I'm just glad that Albert is physically healthy although I don't know if he is mentally healthy after being rejected by most of the media. I hope you can build yourself up well not only as a content creator, but also as a person. Although I don't know how much this means to you but, God is always with you. “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at [him] first." -John 8:7
This was really beautiful. I wish you the best of luck.
I can't wait for people who said that he hasn't changed after being alone for a year to be proven so wrong.
Its hard to say sorry, but its even harder to express your sorry. this video no matter what reason you decided to upload it, really shows how sorry you are and how much pain you went through. People will make a joke out of this despite how sad you are, you know you will still be rejected by the mass media, you know you will be constantly assaulted by the media for returning, but I personally can respect that your taking a leap of faith coming back and just simply apologising. Hang in there you can be forgiven, it just takes effort to receive it.
I watched the video and saw that you did a lot of changes to work on yourself! I do wanna say that I am proud that you have done that. Many people don't have the courage. I wish you all the best! And good luck! May you find happiness! :)
Was bever fan but i will always support those who are truly working being the beat version of themselves... stay safe and dont stop working
I wouldn't mind seeing you make coffee
ive made a lot of mistakes, some also distanced myself from a handful of people because I broke their trust. and as much as I want to make it up to them, they looked better off without me. but I did find joy elsewhere and got back on my feet, I really hope you do too
Cheer up Albert we are here to support you again I forgive you hope you stay well.
People that expected a apology why? Why should he apologize to the internet he should have just apologized to the people that were harmed
Everyone makes mistakes. You are and is still one of my favorite content creator. You're not making excuses but is admitting your mistakes and trying to walk forward again. Take care and goodluck. Will be looking forward for your future :) much love
Im still going to support you,  no matter what people tell me, you didn't see or understand when watching this video, go ahead reply to me just know that im here supporting him still.
Such a well made And Genuine Video. I hope you can find what you’re looking for. *Self-Redemption*
Still one of the greatest creators
Albert, welcome back. We’ve missed you! Can’t wait to see what future projects you’re working on.
This shows that smart people (in our eyes) make mistakes but unlike ordinary people, they try to make a change in their life. Even though you did something wrong, I still managed to learn something from you just like in the old days. Don't give up and try your best!
This is some casey neistat level shit, great video man
Welcome back. The type of event that transpired is a strong catalyst for change and I'm glad that Albert is directing that change in a positive direction. Our minds are fragile, easy to deceive, and easy to influence. I mean, that's what Albert's magic tricks demonstrate right? We constantly remind ourselves of how we came to be, who we are currently, and who we want to become.   Now as for the video itself... wonderfully done. I honestly had no idea Albert had the potential to create a short film of this caliber. He has demonstrated his creative editing abilities with the Austin (formerly Rajj) talent show and his camera know-how through various occasions, but this is new to me. I really appreciate the camerawork (making good use of that camera slider I see), creative transitions and sound design that went into this. The amount of attention to detail is spectacular. So so SO much work was put into producing every shot because it isn't just random footage. It's footage that helps tell a story, which is the most important part of film making.  0:48 did he purposely destroy a violin for that shot...? As a violinist, that is sacrilegious. 0:58 Albert brings forth a stack of papers when he talks about the "details" of the incident, but it isn't just random words on that paper. 2:38 how many pieces of paper did he have to crumple up before being able to make that shot without looking? 3:43 sick and creative transition with the sticker placement on the front lens element. 4:48 creative use of EQ to make it sound like phone call audio...  I know I'm definitely not the only one who can appreciate these things. Albert, your work is inspirational. We know how much effort you put into them. I hope that moving forward, you're able to walk between that fine line of not doing things solely for self validation, but still have people acknowledge your work because you deserve it.
I feel like people take these things out of context. I understand cheating is not justifiable but to the point where people constantly harass and target Albert is worse. These things can take a toll of a person’s mental health and I am glad he did not let the hate get the best of him. He decides to improve himself as a person and learn from his mistakes. Cancel culture is sometimes necessary but for a person like Albert, this was not necessary.
You’re lucky to have Destiny as a friend, he seems like one of those friends you can always turn to no matter what. I’m looking forward to see future music collabs with guys!
I kind of hated you for causing such pain to Lily but boy did you get me with this well-thought video. This is not the usual apology video we get after someone got 'cancelled', and while you did this video for yourself or to update us, I still honestly love how you put so much thinking and symbolism into making this, as a sit-down video is obviously not enough 🤧😭 Hope you'd do well from here on out!
Uhm, that bread looks really nice
Well at least he didn't do something illegal and give off rape vibes -cough- fed -cough-.
This is really well made.
go for it man
Such a good video
He cheated on his girlfriend, it's not like somone died ffs. People are such snowflakes.
That was so inspiring. Thanks for that Albert! Hope u achieve ur goals and become the best u can!
You know I was very critizing at the beginning, I thought a person could never change. But watching this, changed my mind, it even made me cry. Taking a year break was clearly beneficial and I'm so happy seeing the changes made and the growth in just the past year. A person can't live isolated from everyone and everything like in beginning. They need to return to your hobbies and career. Overtime things will get smoother, it is always a bumpy road at first. I can't wait to see your new projects and if you get back to streaming. But most importantly I can't wait to see where your personal growth leads you to. I'm scared to read the rest of the comments but I wish you the best, happiness and a bright future. Also let me just mention is the cinematography is just chef's kiss 👌🏼👏🏼
We all have mistakes. Just please do better in the future.
Im sorry about your grandma, this was a good video.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
When will you be coming back?
Acknowledges a fuck up but doesn't talk about what happened. Nice
Good for you buddy. Good luck with all. Peace
Can't wait too enjoy your content again will support you in coming back too the scene !
I'm so happy your back Albert and I hope your doing well now, remember we are here for you 🙏
Devil's advocates likes to talk alot, but i bet they're gonna stay here until the first video, get bored and leave forever.
YA YA YA YA WELCOME TO THE CHAMPIONS CLUB
It takes a man to apologize, but it also takes another one to forgive     Come on guys.
NGL I was here for the memes, but this video was made beautifully. Inspired me to create. I wasn't even a fan of you before what happened because I never got into your content. But this video was amazing.
Jesus the quality of the video, I tip my hat
Just try albert we will all way be there also your nai nai will watch you if your doing good we are all watching you.
I won't lie,I despised Albert for what he did and yet I find him likable and I appreciate this video...I also am sickened by feds actions...
Omg that was intense. I hope everything gets better for you albert.
Once a cheater always a cheater, sorry dude ur still out
I’m crying lol
though what you did was wrong i feel bad about the sheer amount of hate you got. Nobody really deserves that, i despise cancel culture because not every situation is black and white and there is a reason and a story behind every person. I dont support what you did because it hurt many people, but i feel bad for what you had to go through
Most of the people are here for the drama, and the Albert comeback, but the only thing that i want, is the fucking name of those songs in this video.
If the people you wronged forgave you, then we as audience will only need to say welcome back.
Gotta admit i loved this video and how it has recorded and all the scenes and i actually cried and i will continue being your fan everyone fucks up and  i have fucked up too
Let’s go Albert is backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bro this shit is sickkk
We are all flawed Humans,we make mistakes and screw up. People who learn from this are the Ones that you want to be around. Those who Virtue Signal and act all perfect while spewing hate on the rest of us are the True Enemy and should be avoided at all cost. Stay the Course Albert and ignore those who spew Hate. They are lying to themselves and the World.
I am a new fan of offlinetv and lily so got a lot of info at once (it was a lot) i got lily's promised neverland recommendation (it was beautifull)  and saw his yt channel.. jst came here to check and man i am moved... we all make mistakes the fact that he is accepting and changing for the better is really good and beautifull..like we cancel people for their wrong we should also open our heart if they are geniunely changing themselves to be better...
Every one deserve a second change
20% of men cheat at some point in their life. I's only natural, and he's only human. Welcome back.
man what are these comments, I just wanted a quick glance but everyone wants to write an essay
mans looks dead inside
I was so mad when I heard Albert did... That.. But I can relate to wanting to please people, and everyone makes mistakes and he claims to know he did was fucked up as hell so... I think he changed for the better
2:36 Anyone noticed Bojack Horseman in the background? Such a nice easter egg that suits his situation very well.
Everyone F*cked up at some point. you dont have to forgive him, but you dont have to keep harassing him either. He knows he messed up real bad and he messed up other people  too and his trying to change that. Just let the man change for the better
can someone pls tell me what happen to him
This video was very meaningful
What is the last song that played?
Nice video and excellent production. Keep it up man, you totally got this!
Albert. I don't know you. I am a random observer. But I respect you for this decision, and for looking to improve. This one of the more mature things I've seen in this world right now, even after such a rocky road on your part and that of the others who were harmed. I appreciated this video a lot though and I want you to know you made a random person cry over this video and everything that has gone with it. Stand tall sir.
Its sad people are gonna start supporting now after he fucked everything up just because he made a short film like video.
I’m just going to say it. I don’t like you and don’t think I ever will. I know humans make mistakes and I forgive you. I don’t believe in abusing you when nobody really knows all the details of what happened. I hope you move on and become a better person.
Why does he think that making a high production video will make people forgive him? LMAO
Don't worry king in life we have highs and lows don't give up the high of your life is soon to come king
He used his dead grandma for sympathy. Yikes.
interesting how Bojack Horseman was playing at 2:39
Is that Riley Murdoch from Linus Tech Tips on piano?
Fuck yea dude
Thank god this comments section isn't full of dumbasses who can't let go of the past.
I'm amazed at how strong you are, coming back from what happened. And honestly I'm feeling inspired for self improvement, since I've been having frequent bad thoughts lately. Wish you the best of luck!
Careful where u step A lotus will float itself on a mud But it only take one push for a coin to be completely drowned by the mud  U can let the wind lead your way And even ride it  But don't let it blow you to a hanging cliff.
Forgiving others is hard Asking for forgiveness is harder But forgiving yourself is near impossible  I'm glad you're back. And now that you can finally start all over again, *we got your back, don't worry.*
This video really really moved me. I'm really glad you were able to switch your focus to positives rather than negatives.  Everyone makes mistakes, though that doesn't make them okay, it really does happen to everyone. I'm excited to see new things from you and see where you go from here. :)
I wonder what he thinks about Fed lol Ey on the real tho thanks for teaching us a 5head method to speak to a girl on the DL.
Welcome back
You did nothing wrong bro
damn the production tho
cancel culture should be canceled itself
Huh, I honestly didn't think I'd like this video, but, well, I did. It's kinda inspiring to see your journey, and very distracting from my class, as some who isn't having a nice time, showing how people, you, can change with effort and how life keeps going. The video itself was awesome, like, the cinematography is really nice and the story itself. Anyway, I hope you get better, and well, maybe some people won't forgive you, but, you have showed you can change.
Here is the thing. He fucked up. He got cancelled. He knows he fucked up. Not just knowing, but deep down, the place where the pain cuts deep, he acknowledged and has begun healing. He knows he can't move forward with the past holding him back so he put it out there, selfishly as he said, and is ready for doing things that once brought him passion. What he did was a piece of shit move but I can respect this. He wants to move forward, I don't think anyone has a right to tell him he can't. Everyone makes mistakes, learning and growing from it is how you get past them. Look forward for what he is going to do.  Also, fucking phenomenal cinematography here. He really has passion for film. I would love to see short films from him. These cuts and details were making the movie buff in me kreygasm
Good for you, Albert~
Albert, I support you and I am so happy you're back!
Now you know when people recognise their mistakes they are the best kind of people
Welcome back Albert. 👍
mat davela
I like your funny words, magic man.  Jokes aside, I respect the effort you've put into bettering yourself. I hope everyone is willing to give you a second chance.
Whatever opinion yall may have, this video is well made and i enjoyed it
People just mad they to ugly to cheat
He really got cancelled because he cheated on someone ? Bruh
Dude the video is moving and Great. I learned the hard way that it takes time to change and everyone makes mistakes the test how you move on and learn from them.
You were my favorite content creator back when I learned about you from OTV. I was QUOTE_ME_IF_GODBERT on twitch. I never really hated you; in fact, I went back and watched some clips and vods because I missed you.  But I definitely understood the opposition. I'll spare the majors because they've been said time and time again. In any case, welcome back, Albert. I hope you make good on your word and redeem yourself. I'm not necessarily 'in your corner' so to speak, but I'm definitely rooting for you and I look forward to seeing what you have to offer moving forward.
next time don't get caught
cringe
Why does everyone write a para here...
We are expecting good things in the future, dont let us down
Your love for your work and  hobbies were always admirable. I hope everyone's is a better place rn. Welcome back.
Very well made. Love and positivity brother!
Yo whats up with everyone supporting a guy who cheated on his girl for so long? People keep saying its a "mistake" but it was only a mistake when the man got caught like he would have kept that shit going if he was gonna get caught im so confused man wtf
It's good that you're making the effort to be better. Good luck.
Hopefully he changed for the better. Welcome back boy.
And dont worry your grandmom will be proud and smile watching you hardwork so keep working hard and hang in there
R.I.P to your grandmom may her soul rest in peace
Welcome back.
I can't say I know who you are, what you did, but this video and your words hit me harder than I ever thought possible. I struggle in my daily life with many of the things you mentioned here, I hope someday to find my way out of this dark, lonely tunnel too.
0:52 thats a fucking Lily, im crying
Can't change the past, but can change the future. Best of luck to you.  Edit : side note : this is the first time I've seeb an apology video in this style. I can see that you put alot of effort into this, and that just shows that you mean it.
Whatever your controversies are or even if you are a bad person i dont care as long as you entertainment or motivate someone to smile by your videos.
Such a great video honestly
it’s hard to believe this man did those things but maybe he might just recover
Respect dude. Respect.
Absolutely beautiful and incredibly inspiring. As always, you are your harshest critic- i've been following your work for years, and the content you produce is truly S+. As you continue to work towards fulfillment, we will be here cheering you on!!
This video is emotional terrorism
We believe in you, Albert. You deserve a second chance just like everyone else does. Your friends and fans will support you wherever and whatever you do. Take care and stay safe!
Welcome back Albert!!! I still waiting and love you no matter what💕
I still like you bro
He’s getting made hate for making this video but he legit said the video is for him for his own desire he didn’t do it for the people but for himself. Like just let the man be he fucked up and that’s that he even stood up to it in like some other people who played it off and kept going * cough cough* FeD
I'll admit that I hope I can hate what you did, but I have no right to. . . .                   as I watch the video all I can think of was is there a painless way to realize all of this.
am i wrong or is the song around 7:00 a rerecording of one of lily's songs
PagMan
Cheating is shitty. I think most people will agree with that. Doing it even once is bad... but if you learn from it and shy away from it in the future because you remember the hurt it ultimately causes... I think you should have another chance. Screw up the same way again however and I'll be bringing my own pitchfork.  I personally did not know about you till this was reviewed by Asmongold, but felt like sharing my 2 cents here.
wholesome
Good luck
Can we normalize apologizing for your mistakes and moving on? I can't understand why people should have their whole lives ruined because of a single mistake they made. Apologize and do better in the future. Good luck Albert, you're on the right track now.
This videos good
i fully welcome albert back with open arms, yes he fucked up and he admits it and shows how hes striving to become a better person when he didnt need to be, but this is a really well put together video, this is just my opinion here but i dont think what he did was that bad, like other people have cheated and came back in less time with little problems like doc, but what he did was really cool explaining what hes been doing and going out on his own to become better
Also want to add ur music collabs with other content creators and the league community were AMAZING, ur very talented and I know that many people also enjoyed ur streams and music videos. I'm glad ur staying safe and healthy, cant wait to see u return to stream.
Thanks for sharing this video Albert, we all make mistakes and from those mistakes we grow. This video shows how you've grown from this experience and I can relate to you as being born from an asian family as well. I can't wait for ur return, ur music and creativity was one thing that I enjoyed watching. There will still be haters and toxic people that will try to bring u down, but just know that there are more supporters than haters for you. And ur community will be there to support u.
Add buff to the list of music, magic, and photography.
Man he took these things so heavily to heart, the community needs to chill.
Welcom back! Im so happy.
I’m happy that i clicked this video.
just, glad that youre back and well
This is a real apology video
Hoping for the best for your return. I'm not in the position to say whether or not all of us accept your apology and mistakes. I don't want to remember a person for the mistakes they made but the changes they make to improve on them. I hope this becomes a new chapter for your life and hope you can take a break whenever you seem is necessary to spend time with others.
This is poetic ....i just love this, Stay strong.
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
Hey Albert, I truly did enjoyed you're streams and YouTube videos, I just wanted to say that I'm in the same boat. Ngl but this is going to take years to overcome, like to find happiness etc. And all we can do right now is to just keep moving forward and here's a quote I take to hart, " It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer. "  Good day. uwu~zero
Whether you support him or not, what a well-made video jeez
Sigh.. I still wished you could've just broken up with lily instead of cheating man or spoke up but oh well you explained yourself a bit
You can forgive but that doesn't mean you have to forget. But supporting someone who is trying to do better isn't a bad thing.
It's more important to be back!❤️  I know you'll shine❤️
I dont give a damn about what his personal life went, if he did wrong or whatever. I nevwr followed and watched him because of his real life relationships, I just enjoywd his content. Why the fuck would I care about what sneaker or makeup a streamer uses? I just like the content. People are too empty these days and they look for everything that can fill them.
well we’ll see how this goes...
Hmm . I will be the real asshole if i didn't give you another chance . You realized the effect of what you did. You were punished. Even if the punishment is more than it deserves. I don't like cheating but I hate smashing people because of their mistakes. This makes me worse than them. It makes me despicable. So I am looking forward to your next content 😄  ( I apologize for my bad english ) + To the who gonna be bothered by my words , I apologize for being pathetic, forgiving, sympathetic, and vulnerable. I apologize for being just a human being and not an angel like you
internet is ruthless, good luck. Glad to see you're doing your best
Albert whats your job since you left
Im glad u left otv. They are talentless and were holding u back. Avocado was clearly the better choice. No regrets bro!
This reminds me of that meme with the Russian dude crying on the beach
Lesgooo
I'm not to say this, as I didn't really care that much about the Lily-Albert-Michael drama. I just went by it everytime. I skimmed everything but I knew Albert wasn't a complete piece of shit as made out by the skin of media.  I'm glad I was atleast half a smart person at that time. Had I unsubscribed, I wouldn't have seen a heart warming conclusion to a not so beautiful story.  Edit: I wrote this?
Welcome back !
Not gonna lie, when the thing happened I really got mad and sad that it happen... because your content was godlike and you were a cool guy, and by the looks of it you still are. Lily is an amazing girl, so precious and sweet that it made me think so bad of you! Of course it was a mistake, everyone does mistakes... even though your mistake was a big mistake, but you still have a shot to make it right! I hope everything is going well Albert, I no longer will have anger over you! You can do it!!! Welcome back!
im glad you are back!
Damn people are really falling for this and forgiving him lmao
Don't know what you did. Don't care. Sick video holy shit
I am really glad he is back and not shackled by the past. I hope he better himself moving forward.
I’m not crying, you are
10:21 yooo is that omisphere?
So, @sleightlymusical has comeback? No. Albert, right? Albert, it feels like yesterday i just found out your video and your friend (?) *I hope they are still your friend* about Beauty and the Beast musical. And you know what? I feel so regretful to find such beautiful performance years later. It took me 6 years to find it. And when i just find it, it doesn't take a genius to read between the line, what was happening. But me, i'm no one, i'm not a judge though i know that something must be wrong, and then again, it's not my business, it's already someone's privacy to be exact. And i just didn't get it how people so thirst for someone's life. My life is mine, and your life is yours, not anyone else. Truthfully I have been watching the clip for nth time, i even downloaded it and convert to mp3 ver <sorry for that, i didn't ask first, because you're away from social media and seems like no exact time when will comeback again, which is now> i have been listening to others but you & your friend's version was waaayyy better seriously. Like you can play the instrument alone which is cool but playing it together giving a harmony which is beyond anything. I like the arrangements, the cinematography, the costume, it just so on point, and I can feel that you guys made it with so many effort. I have been listening to it for nth time. Now that you have coming back, I will not ask anything but hope. I guess you can differentiate it(?) I hope you forgive yourself, you can enjoy your time with your family and friend again, and hopefully you will still playing with your violin and not leave it as your dark past, because I know how much you love playing violin and create a short movie perhaps(?) from the way you play and the arrangement of course the cinematography you put on your beauty and the beast musical and this, I guess it already tell everything. So, I hope in the future you will continue to showcase your creativity. Just one thing, ignore people who throw anything bad to you.  *Don't let people ruin your life*
Pog 4k
Welcome back...
This was honestly a whole lot of nothing, basically a glorified 'draw my life' rather than anything that seems genuine. Its meant to be a fairly sad video but he sure as hell seemed to have fun on the editing and the props smh
Albert, i'll be honest. Im at that point of my life too this year and having the same view points and fuck ups, i pray we both will see this through together.
the visual story telling tho
HE IS BACK
I've been waiting for this, i really hope that you're doing fine and that you can become friends everybody again...
Let's go dude! <3
That's some professional filmmaking right there. Good shit.
Now we just wait for Fed to....
come on man realize people do worse things every day than one fucking cheat
As long as Lily and all of other members of OTV forgives you,I will forgive you too  Everyone deserves a second chance but just don't do the mistake again or else we will get you cancelled for whole life.
Welcome back to the champion club forsenCD
🤣
Video quality is So good!!!
Everyone cheats first of all. Its life. Second of all people who are hating are gay and virgins
what did albert do? i dont know anything
Everyone deserves a second chance, I guess. Good Luck!
Welcome back your community missed you Albert.😂
Albert where happy your back
Glad to see change unlike the one that starts with Mini and ends with d... Welcome back Albert
I came back to your channel to taste that stuff you used to make just to discover this. Welcome back Albert.
We support you !! Have a nice return at your pace ! (Btw love that kind of video format)
what you did was really really bad and as a fan i wont and i will never forgive you. but as a human being, you got my respect and i hope you can enjoy life and learn from your mistakes. welcome back.
This video is better than most apologetic videos you see out on YouTube. You put 11 months of thinking and bettering yourself into this video, but I also saw years of friendships you had, destroyed by yourself. I know people probably don’t care about my thoughts but I cannot forgive the fact that you hid the secret of you cheating and also ended up having them both meet each other. Overall I think you should think more about them forgiving you first before thinking about you forgiving yourself, you are not the victim. Time will tell if you are sincere or not, time will also heal wounds. Maybe the wounds are already forgotten by the victim and healed.
insanley good video! awesome attention to detail!
Can i just say that this really helped me. I dont yet fully believe it, but seeing you get past all that shit, makes me lean slightly more towards the fact that there might be light at the end of the tunnel
Good seeing u back and love ur😊
Your still a good person.
The part where he said that he reconnected with old friends means that he's still friends with Lily? Well he showed us a pianist and a melodica soo..
eyy reverse space bar gang
We are humans, we make mistake. Albert made a mistake and he will come back greater than ever.
i wonder when fed's "uncancelled" video will be up...
very well made video, welcome back Albert.
The Video Quality of this was amazing and even though the meaning behind it was sad. You'd be a great short story maker.
Good luck my dude 👍
it's a dam good short film ill give you that
Not exactly an apology video. It's more of a.... Life journey. It helped us learned more about who Albert Chang is. And it's absolutely beautiful. The edit, the shot, the music. I always knew you're talented at movie making but this is really something else. Welcome back Albert.
Welcome back~
You are way better than fed as a person and he badmouthed you...I mean like if he does make a video like this for his return it's gonna be funny  "I've tried to keep my urges in check these past months"😂
When I saw you on offlinetv I never watched you, something felt odd. You were good at everything you did on stream, but, I didn't saw you beyond your talents. Now with this video I feel more related to you, as a human being. Good luck on the next step.
I wonder if your future girlfriends will be able to trust you.
fuck it, i always liked Albert. Still do
Ahhh Albert is in the house yo. So happy to see you back :)
I think this was a great video. Believe it or not, Mizkif has a really good take on this video. Btw, I don't think you are a shitty violinist albert. You are alright, and I hope Lily gets to a point to forgive you. I also hope the internet forgives you. The internet can be a bad place, but it isn't horrible everywhere here. I don't believe that we should cancel people who have made a mistake unless they refuse to  think about their mistakes. I am not going to justify the things you did, but we are not our mistakes.
I don't care what happened back then, as long as you come back a better person. I would support you.   We are all humans, we make mistakes. Big or small, we still make them.
miss u ma dude
YEEEEEEEESSSS
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
Really impactful, thanks for sharing
let's go.... I was thinking about this literally a week ago
Imagine michael came here and said "HEY BUD!"
Whats the use of this? its useless  He still cant move one?
welcome back Albert! btw this vid is actually so good, great job dude.
we know you made a mistake but you are a person to we are not perfect we our just a human being and the good thing is you learn from your mistake. I dont know if im the only who miss you im always thinking if your ok hope offline tv will  still be your friend specially lily welcome back albert<3
proud of you Albert :) no matter how small the steps, forward motion is always progress!
Jesus the cinematography holy crap
I have the same light switch.
Old Friends the ones that are with you NO MATTER WHAT! that shit hit close to home welcome back man and good luck!!!
Honestly I felt mixed emotions at first... but after watching this video, I can say it was very raw, mature, & introspective of him.. he’s still a human being who’s made mistakes but that doesn’t mean he can’t look towards the future & decide what he wants to do moving forward
Amazing video, wish you the best luck in becoming who you want to become
seggs
2nd chances are earned.  This is a step in the right direction.
Albert! WELCOME BACK MAN. It's really good to see you. Great video, beautiful.
Holy bleep xQc was right this guy is a complete narcissist. This is one of the most bizarre apology videos I’ve ever seen. A highly-produced video trying to sell the public that he was “cancelled”.  No you weren’t dude. You cheated on your loyal gf, people were furious - and you chose to log off and run away.   I get it. You are trying to turn your life around. You are seeing a therapist. All of that is great. But this weird movie-level video is just bizarre. Should have just made a raw apology with the facts and moved on.
I support this Albert. Stay strong.
good to see your doing well i wanted to listen to some of your old music and realized you uploaded again great video btw
damn, this redemtion arc finna be good
As a viewer, that's all we can ask for. Do your best. We're not obligated to the pain you've caused nor do you owe us an apology, that's for the victims, not us. I hope sincerely that you have changed since then and live virtuously.
Albert will come back strong and get better Good Luck on your journey Albert.
Clearly couldnt say no lmao
DAMNNNNNNN ITS THE 2 TIMER  THE CHAMPION IS HERE
Welcome back albert!
simpily awoswem
Welcome back, take care of yourself and those around you. Keep fighting :)
We all care about you Albert
This is an amazing video through and through, good to have you back and know that you took the time to work on yourself and still are working on yourself.
WE MISS YOU MAN
this made me cry it was so moving
So why was he cancelled? Genuinely curious.
Wow I swear y’all are some insecure petty losers if you still hate him for what he did.  Welcome back Albert 👍
Just watched some old OTV stuff and saw albert and i wanted to see if he somehow came back to youtube/social media or somewhere else online. Seeing this video makes me happy. We all do mistakes and sometimes it might be right to be angry about persons and their mistakes, but not forever. If we weren't angry, people might not understand that they did something wrong. And people deserve to get a chance to change themself, because mistakes and how we work around those mistakes show who we really are. This video is a proof that Albert noticed his mistakes from the past and is on a really good way to be a better person, or maybe he already is a better person! I'm happy to see u back Albert and i am hyped for new stuff that might come from you, but it just makes me happy to see you beeing able to overcame the mistakes of your past! :) PS: I hope i found the right words to say what i meant to say, english is not my foreign language! :D
Such a hipster video
Welcome back :)
As someone who has been cheated on, this feels like the same emotional manipulation that my ex did on me. I mean he can make content and he can strive for forgiving himself but this feels kinda weird. Second worldly in nature. Just because how it is edited, it feels like he disconnected himself from the audience and just relied edits and cliches to gain sympathy. I know manipulation and this is it.
this is a video that has also inspired me, im glad to see that you are getting back on your feet:)
we'll see
With this video I've forgave you its not much I never held much against you I saw that you cared and you made a mistake but this really moved me, the grandma monologue almost made me cry. I hope you really do achieve the goals that you have set for yourself.
Bruh we all make mistakes its normal just know that you reflected on it and that makes you a good person..
Proud of you dude, I think you did the right thing here. This is a beautiful video and it really seems like you've changed for the better, I'm looking forward to seeing your work in the future!
i wish you the best of luck in your journey
My guy just apologise and move ahead. You keep saying your work life and personal life got mixed up. You cheated om your girlfriend. Stop making excuses for that and admit you messed up and move ahead instead of saying shit like 'my work life and my personal life'. If you are in a relationship that person is supposed to be part of both lives not just your personal life. You made the same mistake by making lily part of your work life and sarah part of your personal life. That's not how it works.
“The person I resolved to become...” So another Matt D’avella ripoff?
Love the way you made the video, good luck on your recovery ^^
This is actually a really good video. If you still can't accept him, it's understandable but I do think you should give him a chance. It's obvious he meant everything he said and truly feels sorry.
Man all UHS students are messed up.
Welcome back
I didn't cry you did D:::
💿✌️
when are you going to cheat again?
hey Albert! glad you're back and it's great to see that you're getting better. this video was super well done, i forgot i was on youtube still and we're looking forward to what comes next
ratio’d
I like a lot of what you said, but i (personally) think that the style of the video, its filmlike nature (which is well done), is misplaced here. I understand not wanting to do this to a black screen or something similar, but the film aspects severly downplay what youre saying. Again though, I like a LOT of what you said and am glad youre getting help and working on yourself. Take care.
forsenCD this champion is on the right track
Controversy aside, this is a really well crafted video
glad to see you doing good man
Welcome back we miss you     No im not crying
Victim andy lmao
respect on standing up in your own feet again
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Honestly tho, blown out of proportion. Cheating is an everyday occurrence (which is a bad thing don't get me wrong) but to cancel someone for it is atrocious. He deserves all the support
I’m glad you were able to dig yourself out
Welcome back. :D
im sorry for your loss. i commend you for your efforts in becoming a better person. this video inspires me and I really loved the videography too hehe. ill continue to support you and look forward to what you can make in the future :)
Idk why I'm crying while watching this
Only time will tell if he gets caught again. What's the purpose of this video? Sorry then say fucking sorry you don't need to make such a good video and manipulate people and play Victim andy
Welcome back Albert! You did a really good job
I just new lily because of Pokimane playing among us I heard lily's vlice and I was curious who was that so I searched for the name lily and lilypichu channel showed up then I was super late knowing her. I saw that she was with albert then watching other videos I didn't know why she was with Michael (I was just watching some of her random videos not watching in order) So I still continued watching her contents but my curiosity keep growing so today I just searched it why did they broke up. My idea was they are far from each other and just ended their relationship but I searched and I saw that he cheated well I didn't know how but then I was curious what was his(Albert)channel. I searched albert offline tv and it didn't show up but I saw someone credit and it says the channel so I came here so the subscribers 500k but I saw that he posted a video 1 day ago and 11 months was the last time he posted his content. I wanna say keep fighting and its okay you did a big mistake but the bigger mistake you do the bigger the things you will learn and realize but the bigger it is the bigger lost will come to you forgiven or not you shouldn't forget what you did and make it as your inspiration to live and achieve your dreams you shouldn't just let yourself drown in all of your problems stand up and make all the things become great and clear.❤️
Hey albert, I don't know if you remember me too well, I was a mod on kyle landrys stream, Danny. I would love to have a talk or catch up or anything at some point to see how you're doing. I understand drastic change like this... It's hard... but not impossible, we all make mistakes, not saying they're ok, but they are human, thats not an excuse, more saying nobody needs to hold onto these things as if they define who we are. I'm proud of the fact that you made a video for yourself and made something FOR YOURSELF, although the pain you inflicted may still be there you owned up to it for yourself and that's something so few people do. Anywhooooo I'm rambling now, but despite what you did and what's happened I hope the best for you and the best of luck in the future C:
I never really new except for the "situation" but at least ur not keterino.
Strive To Be Someone You Want To Be. If There Was No Change Life Would Be Easy. Your Human Remember That.
ur so cringe lollllllllllllll
This is one of my biggest problems with not keeping things private. There's a lot of people who don't understand boundaries and think they have the right to judge you and say what you should do or not, even though they don't consider that they're also human beings as flawed as the people they're criticizing. There's a lot of people that act like this and they eventually come together to "cancel" someone or something and usually don't know when to stop cancelling.  People change with time, and of course we can only see real change through actions but, they will change for better or for worse, we just have to give them a chance to show it.  I hope that Albert gets to show how much he's changed and is changing, not only Albert, I still hope that other people that want to come back get the chance that they deserve.
This is probably the best video I have ever seen - on so many different levels. Congrats, Albert!
Congrats man, I will continue to support you. I relate to you since there was a time to me not so long ao that I also realized how toxic of a man I was, I fucked up, overcame it and became a better person. We man need to work together to fight against toxic masculinity by bettering ourselves, and you showing that, being as courageous as you are, not denying your past mistakes, but learning from it and moving on. I think we can all learn from it, and relate to your story.
this video is so dammed well made, the amount of hard work and creative vision it took to put this video together.
ayy welcome back just make sure you improve man
Who cares if he cheated on someone? Everyone cheats, even women.
Redemption Arc
pog
Welcome back! 😊  video film is  made really great! So proud of you keep on moving forward we'll always be here to support you!!
Not been this touched by a youtube video in a very long while. I don't even know what you've done, just recognize you from offlineTV but damn dude... all the best =)
I was disappointed after what Albert did. I enjoyed his content and what he brought to OTV. I kept thinking that if he just ended things normally he could still be a part of the OTV and friends group. He messed up but there are clearly more messed up things one can do in this world. I don't know what went through his mind to make him do the things he did. Hopefully he learns from what he did and truly becomes a better person. Time heals all things. If people are hating on him for Lily's sake, remember that Lily wouldn't want that. We need more kindness and empathy in 2020.
want a fresca
Albert is back!!! And with a new friend YEAST BOI!!
forsenCD welcome back Champ
I wish you well on your road to redemption.
I don't see how people can justify being *that* upset about what occurred in a relationship they had no actual involvement in. Especially when the party that has the only right to complain has moved on & is in a much better relationship and stage of their life  now.  I think you could have come back without these theatrics but I do appreciate that you were honest enough to admit that this video is selfish and mainly for you.  At the end of the day, you mean nothing - just like the rest of us.
we got something good out of the bad... and lily already forgave him.
Oh shit what's up albert
You're my inspiration, has been since before all the drama. I'm so glad you're back, stay strong & Welcome back~
actually a good response
Look dude, I wish you the best luck. You cheated on Lily but now she has been so much happier with Michael that it makes me realize that flaming you doesn’t change anything. Lily got her happy turnout so I hope I can the growth you’ve experienced over a year
Imagine cheating on someone and then making a video to get people to feel sorry for you. What a psychopathic loser.
For some how i cried and understand that making decision is hard
We all fuck up.  We all make mistakes.  We all hurt people.  We all are humans and we're all trying to be a little better than we were yesterday.
Yeah albert show a photo of flower by lilipichu that makes me sad
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
this made me cry, honestly. Im not the type of person to cry at most things but, this just touched me on another level. I haven’t done anything like this but, its just nice to see albert genuinely change himself for the better.
Welcome back albert!  Honestly I was really hurt on the mistake you made but We are all humans, we make mistakes all time  You fucked up but that doesn’t mean You’re Going to be always a bad person who makes mistakes  I hope you’re fine and doing well
Ngl I'm kinda looking forward to see more of a side of him I haven't seen before
8:58 holy crap!! It's the same piano that SHE used in a certain con before
It's still nice to see you again.
Will sykkuno get burned next
I’m glad that you’re doing fine!  Take your time and I can’t wait what you will make!   Ps I know it’s a short comment because I’m filled with a lot of mixed feelings but! We all move on so jia you!!
Welcome back friend. uwu
7:39 liberty hill pepelaugh
glad to hear from you, hope you keep improving and being good! Insane quality video btw, it blew my mind honestly
We missed you
I think you don't deserve a second chance
I miss you
New fan. Good job 👏
Damn, the fact people sent you death threats is utterly ridiculous and disgusting, I personally accept your apology but I cannot say the same about those people. You don't need to apologize to the disgusting rats of the internet that send death threats for clout and then forgive you for more clout. I hope you're doing well and will continue to support your work.
Good video, much love.
Stay strong, we all do mistakes.
I didn't even know about Albert before the controversy, but I'm actually happy that he's back. The people he hurt have moved on, and I hope he can too
This videos was so well done I would support such format heavily
not going lie that shit almost made me cry. Wellcome back Albert
Good luck!
i just wanna say i really enjoyed watching this video , the story of your journey that you went through to better yourself and cinematography to present the story is really well done ! We welcome you back Albert !
hiii albert!! welcome backkk :D
Dogs :)
Eh people cheat, people get cheated on, you live and let live, lets just hope you learned from your mistakes
7:11 he runs on Liberty (Road) Hill :'0 .... welcome back Albert. We all make mistakes, posting on the Internet doesn't allow anonymity, surprisingly, the people we turn to it for "validation" are anonymous. Forgive yourself, and stay strong (:
Some people say “just do a genuine I’m sorry video, like Logan Paul”   This was more effective, made you sympathize, informed you on the things he did to better himself, etc.  The best response he could hav had, excited to see your stream m
It's not my place to say, but this helped me a lot, despite being new, I never hesitated to make this comment. I have never been too open, that I'm longing to be noticed. I just want to make people happy, yet in the end, I always find myself suffering. This video made me see a better picture of courage, which I find the frame quite wonderful, made me see a point in life, and made me want to live.
Welcome back boy!! It is good to know you are healty and trying to rediscover yourself... Wish you the best and I will continue, even if isn't much, supporting you. ❤🇦🇷
7:11 Was that shot of you running on "Liberty" Hill on purpose? I kinda like the subtle references you sprinkled in this video. Best of luck in your future!
A person that puts himself out there after hitting rock bottom for a long time in my eye deserves a chance at redemption. Well made video reflecting on the past wrong doings but not letting it define who he is.
It's good that you're working on yourself, I hope you find your happiness again.
Welcome back Albert, I am happy that you could finally come back. Looking forward to everything! :)
I hope people are not still caught up in what he did wrong but focus on what hes doing to change himself to be better. I am willing to have him back as content creator, I wonder who else will.
This video was amazing to watch. Nice work Albert
We are all human and we make mistakes, as you mentioned in the video is what matters is what you do after you make the mistake. You are not the only one who have ever cheated personally have done the same, very cool that you started to forgive yourself and improve. Enjoy life mate
We believe in you Albert! Actually a good quality and sincere video unlike some other ones
honestly a beautifully shot and edited video I don't really know much about you besides the drama but this video was incredible.
<3
I would say some meaningful shit but it seems everyone else has already said it for me, I’m glad you realized that mistakes aren’t the be all end all, I’m glad you were able to pull yourself up and Everyone here will be here rooting for your push forward.... Your doing great Albert so keep pushing forward.
This is soooooo like a movie intro beginning type of shit this is amazing
I’m so excited to see what you have in store and I’m glad your back! Your content was so good and I remember watching clips of some cool things you did while streaming and I can’t wait until you get back to doing what you love doing!
THE 2X IS BACK BABY!!!
i hope he just doesnt cheat again
You made a mistake, took time, and are making a thoughtful and genuine effort. In my book, that’s the right path. Plus, a hell of a lot better than others that stay online
As it's been said so many times now, we all make mistakes. I'm glad to know you're learning from them. As somebody who has fucked up a lot in my life, I know all too well what hitting rock bottom feels, along with the importance of owning those mistakes and not pretending they didn't happen. Taking them and learning from them is what you need to grow and become something more. To transform into somebody *you* can be proud of.  I've been working on myself a lot more. For so long, I've been so selfless that it eventually became selfish. That statement may be hard to understand if you haven't lived it. It was so bad that even just the act of somebody loving me made me hate myself that much more. Happiness can never be external. Which is why games and music and other hobbies may not work now. We may think that's what makes us happy, but we have to look deeper. I always derive happiness myself by making other people happy, too. But that happiness isn't sustainable, because you just can't make everyone happy. So when I ruin relationships or I upset somebody, especially somebody I care about, I see it as a failure and I internalize that pain. I see it as I can't make *anyone* happy. I know that's not true, but in those times I can't think about it any other way. That's why working on yourself is so important.  For a lot of us, looking at ourselves is too hard, so we look at others and judge them or compare ourselves to them. It's easy to say we won't be like that or do that. But in all actuality, that's an impossible statement. I'm not you. I am me.  But then, who am I really? Well, I don't know. And honestly, that's the scariest thing. I'm 31 and have no idea who I am. My friends will tell you I'm a sweetheart with a heart of gold who enjoys doing things selflessly, even to a fault, if it helps another person. But the truth is... I just want to find happiness. My mental health has made that impossible for me, or feel impossible. My broken mind knows this which is why pleasing other people don't bring sustainable happiness.  Sorry for the essay. Just saying I know how it feels, Albert, to lose yourself. The journey we make to find ourselves is arduous, but needed. I don't exactly know what happened, either, but I truly hope you find that inner peace and one day that both of us can find a way to look in a mirror and be proud of who we see. Good luck, man. And good luck to everybody else who finds themselves here at rock bottom.
Honestly, I shit-talked you into oblivion when I first read up on what happened but, as incredibly fucked up it was, I realize you're still human - with your own emotions and struggles, too. I don't condone what you did, and never will, but I am happy that you are taking care of yourself. I always thought your production value was the best of any streamer I've watched. I'm looking forward to a comeback and seeing you happy again.
Let’s get to work Albert!
The people who still cant forgive Albert for what he's done, the past is the past. Stop reminiscing in the past, it's the present. At this point and time in the present, you're just trying to find more excuses to hate him.
Hello again. Good that u are getting back up on your feet.
I mean what happened is still fucked but respecc none the less
Cool so great for a such fucked up person (No hate). It took a great and a lot of effort to fix life  Good job albert.
I think we can all agree that actions speak louder than words. If 11 minutes can capture these actions, I'm sure as hell you have done done a lot more then you give yourself credit for.  all parties appreciate this, and I'm proud of you for capturing Albert. I believe in you!
dont care came to dislike
Hey , welcome back glad to hear ur doing good .
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don't even know what happened but this video is really good for an apology video.
Waaaaay to overproduced
Glad you’re back. Hope you’re finding happiness
Hey I dont care what u did. I still love you for who u are!!!
What did he do
Using his most beloved interest as an outlet for his emotions has to be one of the most genuine acts of asking forgiveness I've ever seen. This video, if anything, tells me how genuine you are.  Welcome back Albert.
Everyone deserves second chance
It’s great that he acknowledged his mistakes,and that didn’t stop him.
:) missed your content, great video, best of luck for the future!
If ALL apology videos are like this,it will be 100× better than crying infront of camera and 1000 cuts
Welcome back man! Take care bro.
You are talented as fuck.
This is a motherfucking redemption Ark
Treat people like shit and laugh about it karma will come around and bite you in your ass as it did before, do it again you won't get a 3rd chance.
Welcom back
Omg, I thought my eyes deceived me. Glad you are okay. Stay safe and keep going. As long as you are alive there will be hope.
LETS GO ALBERTTTTT!!!
wait, someone enlighten me, why was he cancelled to begin with? cheating? for real? are viewers that degenerate these days?
I'm going to be honest for a while I felt that what you did was unforgivable and I still feel the same way but I know what it's like to make a huge mistake and get and practically feel like a piece of shit so just because I've been in your very same position I know what it feels like to regret something Beyond anyone elses understanding. And so I asked you not anybody else but you to forgive yourself but to forgive does not mean to forget remember that mistake you made and hold it as motivation to not make a mistake like that again so when you're about to make a questionable Choice you'll think to yourself but what will the consequences of that be.
Dear Albert,  I'm really happy to know that you are looking foward into becoming a better person. I missed seeing the notification of *sleightlymusical*, it sure has been a while,  but i'm really glad that you came back to tell us what you've been doing irl. Usually i'm not the type to cry because of an "apology video", but the problems you have are very similar to mine, and the way you're trying to make the rainclouds go away...it's just touching to me. I'll be always here to support you, life is made of choices and sometimes you make the wrong one and, although that sucks,  it makes you become a more mature person. Anyways, i hope you keep working on yourself so that you can become the man your grand mother knew that you could be.  I'm sorry for your loss, may Yueh Jaw Chang rest in peace.  Take care Albert.  With love, Sub, a random guy that enjoys your content.
Welcome back albert. With no hard feeling or anger
this is a very thorough and honest apology and it is acceptable. being unfaithful should and wont ever be forgiven.
You are all normalizing cheating in relationships. Albert still has not actually made a proper apology for cheating on Lily. An 11 minute hype return video is vain as shit, and shows where Albert's mind lies. This is highly manipulative, and you are all eating it up.
fuck the people that are saying he doesn't deserve a second chance when the people he hurt wanted him to come back after he took time to reflect himself. Now that time (after a year) has come and people still be assholes when the people actually involved already moved on.  I think this video is a great start to prove one can change into a better person.
Least you didnt inappropriately touch your friends
A handful of mistakes should not define a lifetime of betterment.  Believe in change. Everyone is capable of it.  Good luck Albie
JESUS THIS VIDEO IS SO WELL MADE , YO HOLLYWOOD WHERE U AT? COME GRAB THIS MAN :)
Welcome back ! Good to see u again :)
i freaking cried
i got no problem with you coming back but stop saying i cared so much about other people if you are gonna change accept your failiures
now lets wait a year and fed will come back
I stumbled across this video not knowing everything that happened etc. and was not previously subscribed. I’m sad to say that we demonize people that make poor choices as if we’ve never made a bad decision ourselves and act “holier than thou” and refuse to give others a second chance when in reality we do that to ignore our own transgressions. I used to be one of those people. I’ve made decisions that I will always regret but as you said, hopefully the next time you search my name I’ll be who I aspire to become (paraphrasing a bit) regardless of what you did I believe in a man (or person) that looks what they’ve done in the eye and does not turn away, but work to never be that person again. By posting this video you’ve helped me realize that while I’m better I need to take more action to be who I want to be and stand where I want to in the future. I thank you for that. I know that you may not see this comment, or ever talk to me, but thank you for being a better person, because you’ve now helped me. I respect you. Thank you again.
Welcome back Albert, hopefully, see you soon more often and past will be past everyone forgets about the past one day.
In the past i did get a lot of joy from listening to your music and I am sorry that you got into a position where you and a lot of others were hurt. I just wanna say that I still appreciate you and hope you come back some day to bring us the content you enjoy making so we can enjoy it too. <3
This was a beautiful inspiring video
Damn my eyes are watery cause of the brightness of my phone being so close nothing else
There are so many small details that reference why he fucked up in the first place. This may be an apology video, but I really appreciate how much effort he put into it, and I personally welcome him back.
I’m glad you’ve been getting help, and wish you luck in future endeavors.
Looking forward to seeing you again Albert. Stay strong and ignore the haters.
I've found logan pauls apology video more appealing than this. just the tone of his voice eegh.
Can’t wait to have you back man. Btw the first apology video I’ve seen where the person actually is sorry.
Even though I'm disappointed in the choices you made in the past (I don't even know full the details, so who the hell am I to judge?) I chose to watch this video to see if you were going to make a generic shitty "I'm sorry" video or make it something else. At first when I saw the carefully placed violin, the bouquet of lilies and the rubik's cube in the background that's what I thought this was. Instead of immediately closing my screen I choose to change my screen and listen to your words. For the time you took to make a video actually talking about the changes you made in your life I thank you, I hope to see this continue into the future. Even though we don't know each other and I'm just a random ass person who has a youtube account I believe in you Albert. Change is hard but it makes life so much better.

You were never canceled, you got caught cheating on your girlfriend and left. No one canceled you.
Really happy you found yourself and grinding to become a better human. Take care man!
Cancelled? You cancelled yourself... you chose to go offline and make it a bigger fuss than it is... in the end your fans weren’t hurt.... people close to you were.
Honestly one of the most sincere apology videos. Good job and keep up the good work.
You got this homie!
Its human to make mistakes, nobody is perfect. Glad to see you are back Albert.
The worst part of cancel culture isn't even when innocent people are targeted, or when the guilty are bullied too far, its that the uninvolved mob think they have any right to an opinion on the matter and bully the target, or the supposed victim. If you are a viewer of a person, that's all you are. You aren't involved, and you don't get a say in their life or the lives of those close to them. Remember that.
Welcome back
"He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her." You know what you did people, stop getting on a high horse. Give humans who are made to fail a second chance, or at least don't be supprised if you wont get a second chance yourself. I'm neither this mans judge nor executioner, just a fan that hopes he wont hurt others, himself and the fans that just wanna like his content again.
Everyone likes a comeback.
Guys. He is trying. An indefinite cancelation is not what we should do here, and instead, we should try to welcome him back, and allow him to prove he's become better. Don't fault him for the stylization of video, because scenes we "staged" Ofc they were, its a fucking video.  I don't expect him to record his actual sessions. Also yes, going to therapy for his mental health is good, and he didn't do it because he cheated, but because of the reaction, and because of the mental state he was in. He was told to kill himself by thousands, and his life was crushed,  by a mistake. We make mistakes, but as a society, we should learn to accept people after their mistakes. Grow the fuck up, and let this man breathe. his first video back and you ignorant fucks decide to harass him again. Don't you think what we did as a community was enough? If you care about anything related to the situation, then you would know to shut the fuck up and be happy for the man. He opened up to us, and showed he was vulnerable.
this is the best apology video i’ve ever seen from someone! you don’t tell us that you’re a “completely different person”, you hold yourself accountable, and reform yourself into a better albert, and i’m so glad you’re taking care of yourself. even though you did make a big mistake, you’re able to pick urself up and begin living a better lifestyle. it must’ve been hard to come back to a place where people still haven’t moved on, but we’re here for you, and excited to see you become a better, happier self. good luck dude :-)
Good video was a risky and sensitive move but u pulled it off good job boy
Hey welcome back cheat on people more often so we can have this banger content about making coffe
could you also help your boy fedmyster out with a return video?
coming from someone who has made a lot of progress personally as well, i fully hope you make a comeback. loved this video. great production, you're a natural filmmaker. subscribed hoping to see more like it soon.
good video, Albert :)
Welcome back Albert. SUPPORT!
man is speedrunning creating the best produced yet worst apology video ever
PICK A CARD ANY CARD THE 2 OF WIVES?! EXCELLENT CHOICE!
Cheating is never forgivable.
So pretentious haha. I can not take this seriously. Well good luck Albert definitely won’t be tuning in anymore.
I have no clue who you are or why you are apologizing but this video is amazing! Good luck and good job for the work you have done so far
ForsenCD
movie
Your life is much bigger than the big fuck up you produced. You won't be able to recover all the things you have lost but you can for sure build new connections and a new type of happiness going forward. I will be cheering for you and hope you can fully understand that being a happy person is the same as being a good person.
This is insanely impressive. I'm not talking about the production (though I want to say that it's crazy good too), but the personal growth and the honesty showcased in the video. I 100% agree with Albert in that what he did was wrong and hurt a lot of people, but also in that it doesn't define him for the rest of his life. In the end, we're all human and we all make mistakes - some worse than others - but what's important is that you acknowledge them, learn from them and, crucially, actually take the steps necessary to improve. That last part can be really hard.  To me, this video was inspiring. Ignoring what caused Albert to improve, working on oneself is something everyone can find difficult and intimidating - myself included. Seeing this process so well-narrated with such a frank point of view was eye-opening and again: inspiring. I truly wish Albert and everyone else involved the very best. And though as a single viewer, my opinion might not mean much, I welcome him back as a content creator.
the denial in the comment section is unreal.
Damn didn’t need to flex so hard. Like DAMN this was a great video man. 10/10 production. I’m so Glad you’ve finally/is in the process of forgiving yourself and actually is working toward being a better person. Do you for you.
me cheat me sad me victim
Hello
what a beautiful video dude,  i loved everything about it, your audio/visual narrative it's over 9000!  keep up the good work and keep evolving, you are already on the other side... time to have fun
cringe
everyone hating on him for coming back and making this video needs to understand what happened between him and lily is between them not our business so stfu and let him be he apologized and that’s it we all make fucking mistakes yes cheating is something that has no excuse and i’m not excusing his actions but i’m saying that we don’t need to hate him for coming back
Honestly, this video shows that he doesn't look for forgiveness in the people who hate him for what he did. This is a reminder for himself and everyone who hit rock bottom in life that you can always bounce back if you wanted to and if you really tried to. Welcome back, Albert Chang.
Damn. Thats some epic story telling of what happened on the last 11 months into a 11 minute video. You should be directing movies.   Not gonna comment about the obvious (your private stuff is not my affair). Life goes on, we move on. Glad you were able to find your footing.
hope you can forgive yourself one day, till then I'll silently support your shit.
Hey man nice video, thanks for the watch. Don't let the past define who you are as a person on the inside. And the outside changes as often as the seasons and weather does... As you grow older, you'll realize in 5-10 years? Will anyone really care what you did 10 years ago if you try to be a bit better? I think at this point in my paragraph, the answer is pretty obvious. The only opinion that really matters.. The one that truely.. really matters. Is the opinion of yourself, subconsciously  or consciously... Your opinions of yourself will reflect your outward actions and emotions in more ways then way regardless of how you think they do. If your opinion of yourself is overally negative then your emotions and actions will match the beat of your own drum. Humans struggle with heavy emotions because we are emotionally teather creatures. Suicides are ever higher because the younger generation struggle with self validation over happiness. I'm Glad to see that you're looking with your toes pointed in the right direction. It's a long round but if you take it one step at a time you'll reach a place that a decent portion of society can't say that have in an entire lifetime. Keep struggling to better yourself and the gravitational pull of your positivty towards yourself will in turn reflect with your friends and family around you. I don't have any opinion on what you did outside of things you've probably already read a thousand times. I struggled with low self worth for a long time myself through awful and sometimes illegal parenting that isn't anyones business. I'll sum it up to say i stood up to my abusers and have since improved to be my own man in my own life and both parents and proud and treat me much better... well at least one does. Life gets better in most cases the longer you live if you want change it'll happen, just takes awhile. Patience is truly a virtue.  Stay strong and more importantly, stay happy.. not all the time.. But a decent majority is all anyone can ask for.
Welcome back buddy and ignore the children who are clearly not experienced enough in life to understand your perspective. Just do what you love. Awesome video <3
Strange that he got cancelled for something like this, sure it was an asshole move but still its a part of life. get over it
This is a movie man welcome back!
Redemption Arc. lets go
Im glad you Back ❤️
Never thought I’d see a video from you again
PogU Albert is back
Glad to see you back
people really believe he sees a therapist? lmao
Welcome Back
Why not just come out with a video of you sitting down in front of the camera and admitting to what you did. Say sorry properly. Why make a big show of it with the sad music etc... just to make people feel sorry for you. Grow up.
Hope the new start goes well Albert!
Did anyone notice the liberty sign on 7:40 ? 😭😭
I understand that Albert may have made some bad choices and decisions, but it seems like he has reflected on all those past mistakes. I hope that he can be forgiven, and let back into the community. I DO NOT believe that anything he did wrong was right (like hurting Lily), but I believe that if he is given a second chance, he can change. Life is all about making mistakes and learning from them. It satisfies me, seeing that he knows that he did wrong. I wish Albert the best.
This is a good video. You have paid more dearly for your mistake than other ppl might for a similiar feat. I can't be mad to you because i know you have been throuhg touch times because of it and you've been punished enough. Of cource it stiff effects you and things won't ever be the same. Anyways it's a new start and things have started to turn back into their places in every community.  Good luck in the future, you're a talented man. I'm sure you will be alright.  Ps. delete twitter it's not good for anyone
@5:01 "I valued the happiness and approval of my peers, friends, and loved ones far above my own,.."   Well seems like u didn't... before... well I hope that statement is true while in the process of becoming a better person.  I guess.. I might as well silently watch you grow as a better version of yourself.. even though my image of you is a guy who cheated on this girl.
This has all the marks of a political ad. Ivezeen a lot of political ads. This is the same. Albert. Just go into politics.theres a lot of money in it. You'd be great at doing this for other people, but for yourself? Eh. It reeks of narcissism.
Holy shit wait that was really good
tbh it really doesn't matter any of us forgive or not Lily already did forgive him all of us are human and human do make mistake and learn no matter how bad was it the most importantly is he need to forgive himself for what he have done if he really do feel he really done is really unforgivable  it will takes a very long time to finally able to accept it
My man took Apology video advice from Patrick Bateman
who is this guy?
hey man, we all make mistakes.  I forgive you.  Welcome back.
Omg I am still seeing so much unnecessary hate comments and it really is saddening to watch. Lily forgave him and moved on with her life. Why don't you guys just do the same. I pity the people who still keeps hard feelings towards something that happened long ago, that doesn't even concern them directly and that thinks they deserve to forgive/not forgive him. If you hate him that much at least don't spread that negativity in the comment section especially after watching this video..
Really missed you bro I hope you are well!
Nice vdo!! Hope you are happy in your future...
Cool Edgar Wright meme at 6:56. :)
?? bro just say sorry and move on this high production video was so unnecessary.
Man, good for u. hope you introduce yeast to us in the future
"When you do what you love, your life becomes your work." This was it Albert.
I have missed you, your magic tricks, your camera work, and your violin. This will be the great return of the Albert Chang, welcome back.
The return of the second king
Actually really appreciate that he's being really real about what he's going through and his thought process through it.  It's good that he's endeavoring for self change.
lol wtf
Welcome back Albert. Glad your growing and not wallowing in depression like all these trolls are wishing on you.  Next step is to make 40 minute video with no cuts, talking your differences out with lily and burying the hatchet so all these trolls can finally shut the fuck up. (Or don’t cause after all, it’s none of our business what happens in your personal life)  Also it really blows my mind how people are still trying to cancel him even after lily forgave him and everyone is happy and moved on with their lives. It’s over. Move on. Shut up(kindly😊)
People who still talk about the pass are people who can't move on. So stop thinking/talking about the pass and move on.
bruh I forgot I'm still subscribed to him on this channel xDD and I'm surprised people took this positively?
This guy fkin makin a really long ad
forsenCD  PICK A CARD ✨ forsenCD  ANY CARD ✨ forsenCD  THE 2 OF WIVES? ✨ forsenCD  EXCELLENT CHOICE ✨
Good luck Albert. Of course nobody is going to like what you did. But that doesn't mean you can't grow or learn from it. I'm glad to see you're truly bettering yourself.
Deep.
im with you! growth up
WeirdChamp
The forsencd memes will probably never go away, but youre a very talented person. People are entitled to their opinion of you even if they werent the victim of your actions, but if you make some damn good content theyll always come to consume it. I personally look forward to seeing more from you, because i think no one deserves to be cancelled forever, and i know youre a great content creator. Hopefully youre strong enough to not let shame keep you from what you love doing forever because the world is a better place with your content regardless of your mistakes.
"Mistakes Aren't what ultimately defines you, it's what you do after you make them." Straight facts
Why is the internet such a negative place that just treats everyone like shit man... what have we become?
My man forsenCD
@sleightlymusical More music please? :)
kind of an ass move making a whole professionally produced melodramatic self-flagellation turned redemption arc video...  ... but that's just me.
You seem genuinely sorry for what you did and have used that experience to improve yourself and try and become a better person. This, and because you do make fantastic music is why I will continue to follow your work and remain subscribed. Chin up Albert, the past is the past.
We all make mistakes, but I'm glad you've taken taken the steps to forgive yourself and try to change yourself for the better. Welcome back and all the best for the future.
high quality video just shows how fake you are
Everyone makes mistakes. And we can resolve them. Just like Albert did. I'm glad your doing okay man.
Well I'm definitely open to some pour over videos or atleast a breakdown of your set up.  Do you water your plants with your stag always? 😂
Please forgive him... bruh its so genuine
I hate apology videos, so I'm glad you made it like this. People always look to see if the apology is genuine, or if it was just said to calm people. By showing what you've done during all this time, it isn't simply an apology, but also an improvement video. No one's perfect, but people online with a great following are judged far harsher than normal everyday people. Keep ur head high and do your best man.
Doesn't matter who you are, everybody deserves at least a second chance in life. So I will give you a second chance. Focus on yourself, and be strong. Everybody in their lives can make a mistake, nobody is perfect.
This is a great come back video, I wasn't really a fan of you but welcome back albert
This was a solid apology it was easy to consume and you made no excuses you said outright yeah I fucked up good job gold star
words don't mean shit. be a man and show you have changed through your actions. your in action speaks volumes itself
a very nice easter egg, in the scenes where he was running, he ran across liberty road. lots of attention to detail in this vid
A little overproduced, but honestly you sound more down to earth than most of these children raking in hundred of thousands from randoms online. Look forward to seeing what you produce in the future.
i have no clue what happened but good vid...
I’m surprised y’all supporting this, can’t wait for everyone to give fed a warm welcome back
8:51 Kyle Landry?
Imagine ghosting your family over some highschool drama.
Comments are for sure being deleted
Welcome back , much love 💫🖤
SOOOOOOO This is random but I don’t care welcome back
GOOD PRODUCTION = GOOD APOLOGY OMEGALUL
It's true what he did was very "fked up " and is still hard for people to forget . But you know there will always be a full stop for every sentence maybe its time for this one and start a new one😶. Anyway all the best Albert
Love you, Albert!
welcome back to champions club
Welcome back to the champions club, drip in.
In this video I already see an amazing artist. Glad you’re back Albert!
Anyone want to TLDR because I only got through 2 minutes
2x
I’ve watched this video like 5 times already, it has a very important massage and his film making is crazy
He needs to collab with Fed for his return. CancelledTV
It honestly amazes me how people feel they are entitled to a public apology like he cheated on them like bruh focus on your own life, if you don't have one and are obsessing over him not bowing to your will get one...
Welcome back
good video
WELCOME BACK ALBERRT  I really thought that you’ll never comeback and it made me sad because i have always thought that you are a very talented person and i enjoy your content   And now you’re finally back❤️❤️❤️
Good luck bro 😊
WE MISSED YOU SO FUCKING BROOOOOOOO!!!!! I LOVE YOU MAN THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK PLS STAY ❤❤❤❤
Honestly I would say you have grown up
5:37 D: YO WHAT THE FUCK, HES BURNING THOMAS. CANCEL HIM D:    Nah just kidding <3 :), hate what you did, but I like you albert, everyone should get a chance to change, and I hope you did. Also props to you on this film, it looks fucking cool. Welcome back albert ☺️
forsenCD
Welcome back Albert hope you keep your head up and start streaming again
Welcome back to the champions club
that picture 5:20 is that offlineTV? Scarra, lilly, poki, toast, micheal/fed?
The mistakes u made were in the past and u bet ur ass that weve all done mest up things, every mistake u made is a learning proses and i have seen a growth in ur life, and this video is not a basic ass apology video and i know that you could always do better
7:40 Liberty Hill street sign, also the ship name for Albert and Lily
Every body can change his self but not every one can accept his self i wish u Albert the best we sit in the same boot. ;  /i hope i ll forgive ur self and accept it one day  <3
Ngl I hoped he came back sooner, but it makes sense why he took this long. Welcome back Albert :)
Although we might not be the people that were in the core of the matter. Speaking from myself, I forgive you. Not for what happened in your private life but for the high expectations that were crushed. We can all tell that you have grown, we should all look at Albert through the lense of a human being. He failed, but we all do. Everybody does different mistakes and believe it or not, cheating is not the worst mistake you can do. This video is really inspirational and I can't wait to see you come back
This was fye
Good to see you back,
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺
I don’t get why people are harassing him for making a well made, maybe even cheesy, video. It’s a fucking video. Sure he didn’t bluntly say, “I made a mistake and fucked up” instead he made those few sentences and made it into paragraphs, explaining his hardships, explaining what he fucking did, and most importantly saying sorry.  People who shit on people because of the past are the same fucking people who say “Forgive and forget”. It might not be everyone, but there are definitely people who are like these. Its not even your story.
hey b hope you can get back on your feet well know you messed up but you can get back up, not a supporter of yours but dont think you should live a life labeled as a cheater.  you make good music
F
What a great film! Great editing, great filming, great storytelling! But I hope you understand that I will not support you anymore because of what you did. For me cheating or creating unnecessary harm to others is one of my pillars of big no. But I'm happy that you're alive and well.
ALBIEEEEE!!!!
this dude really made himself a movie trying to be a victim andy lmao
As someone who suffers from depression, this made me cry. A lot. I'm hoping I'll have the courage to visit my therapist again. I'm tired of destroying my relationships with other people.  I'm glad you took care of yourself while you were on a break. I hope people will stay out of your business. (Highly unlikely, eh?) Lily has mentioned that both of you have talked already and I hope people will respect that.  Looking forward to your content. Stay safe, Albert.
Ah yes 2020 just became x10 better. Welcome back albert, i hope everyone forgives you too <3
Albert only cheated on his girlfriend once! yahoooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!, Albert only cheated once on his girlfriend, yahooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
He felt he had to make this for cheating on a girl?  I'm positive that MOST of the people watching this video have done the same, if not far worse, and probably don't even realize it because young people's values are so backwards.  Who cares if he cheated on a girl, who cares if the girl cheated on him...lol.  Move on.
This was good... Very good! Good job and good luck, you got this man and the video it self was impressive. Subbed! Liked! Will watch more in the future
Alright mate. Now its time to stand back up.
Even tho I won’t be watching or support u personally hope that this second chance will change u for the better good luck
Why do people take cheating as such a HUGE mistake, you almost take it as bad as abuse. Chill, is a mistake that can happen easily to anyone since we live in a society that taught us that monogamy is the only real thing. It hurts but is not that big of a deal and it's a problem that only concern the people involved, not a reason to cancel someone (Perpetuating this mentality about cheating make some people believe hurting or kill their exes for this reason is okay). Stop pretending you are all perfect.
Quality of this video is outstanding, to the top! Welcome back :)
not yeast boy... T.T
WELL, FROM NOW I'M ONE OF YOUR FAN AND SUPPORT.
Good to see you back. And stronger than ever by knowing how weak you (we) are. That was an amazing video. I wish you all the best in this journey.
Genuine question who is this guy???
Welcome back
This just made me smile. I'm glad you are trying to find yourself!
Good on you, don't let mistakes you make when you are young hold you back. Learn from them and you will be a more genuine good person than the people who think they have never made a mistake. I don't know you well, but this is a very good message.
Dont be so Hard on yourself Albert, we learn and educate ourselves from our mistakes, its sad that a private matter should define your career
welcome back men, cheer up... every one makes a mistake, the important is you learn from that mistake and dont repeat the same mistake again.... use it as your fuel to move forward, to be a good person... yes you fuck up and there where still some people whos going to bash and pull you down, what you need to do now is to prove them wrong, prove them that you change, you change for the better... honestly im a big fan of offline, but every person deserves a second chance... once again welcome back albert, and hope to see more contents from you.. just always call up above if you feel lost... from one of your fan here in the philippines, GOD BLESS!
WTF!! WE ALL DO MISTAKES... OMGGGGG JUST BECUSE HE IS FAMUS THAT HE HAVE TO PUNISH?? WHAT ABOUT UNKNOWN PEP WHO WILL JUST MOVE ON....??
Welcome back Albie, can't wait to see more content
Hey ALbert!!! I loved your video!!! Much strengh to continue, bro. A big Hug from Portugal
can't change what happened but it never is to late to try and change to be a better person to yourself and those around you, good to see you're back!
Guys u need to stfup and or only say welcome to albert, he alredy asked for apologies and you have no right to tell him anything
2:22 I thought sleeping 8 hours a day was normal..
Ok cheating is all bad and all but i don't believe anyone should get cancelled for cheating on somebody
Good to see you back :)
This is the weirdest most manipulative short film ive ever seen, wouldn't even call it an apology.
Welcome back Albert, is good to have u back <3
y
All this guy did was cheat on his gf? So what! It’s not like they’re married. Doesn’t even count. Grow up people.
This is an amazing video. We all forgive you, and it's time for you to come back online homie!
Sup Asmon?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. This is what i waited for! The return of Albie. Him. Faults were made. Second chance it is.
This is kinda cringe right but everyone gets a 2 chance
I mean at least he isn't the worst otv members anymore
DUDE COMING BACK STRONG!! I SEE YOU! ^^
Pog
ESSAYS IN THE COMMENT SECTION WutFace
Holy shit what is wrong with people in here acting like this dude ruined their life cause he cheated on his girlfriend.  Cheating no matter what is fucked up and you should never do it but its so stupid that someone loses their lively hood over one mistake that thousands upon thousands of people make.
Its a shame you have this ability to make a good video but didn't use it to make an actual apology.. something that actually meant something versus you explaining why you did what you did and your back story. That isn't going to fix anything neither would the apology. Its like fixing a broken plate but it would have meant more. You are just trying to get views now, off of your mistake..
inspiring :D
Damn that camera and editing work was so good
Can someone tell me what happened?
fried chicken is fire
this has to be the most high quality "im sorry" video ive ever seen
Welcome back. This video is very well made and it felt genuine. I look forward to your future content.
Hey man, glad your back, i hope you will make better content for the future and live a happier life, good luck and glad to have you back
I forgive you. Everyone makes mistakes and like you said its what you do after them that's important. And so far it seems you've been taking the right steps. I'm happy for you. Keep it up.
Holy f now thats the way to comeback to the internet
Welcome back albert
Happy you're back <3
I got to be honest, I'm not a fan of you, and when I met OTV I knew something was wrong with you, I didn't like you, and I can't say I do now. But I hate cancel culture and I believe people can change for the better. From the bottom of my heart, I hope you succeed and that your career and life get better
As long as he changes im okay with him being back
Cool.
2 minutes in and Im already crying... I can’t speak for all but I do know that behind those aesthetics of video editting and story telling, there is this broken guy whose trying to piece himself back.
4:12 I didn’t know you flipped balisongs I saw that nautilus
All things aside, that video was VERY well made. I got goose bumps at the end lol
Hi Albert I don't know if you'll read this or it's just gonna stay here as just another comment but after this video I think it's worth a shot to get this through. You've always been a cool person and the art you've created has always met a certain standard. This video is no exception idk where you have been and what you've been doing but I think what you said in the video and the subtext of it does make me feel more at ease with all of what happened I uh... Saw a video of yours recently on my feed consistently crop up and I avoided it every time it had too many bad memories for me because Idk why that particular time in my life just was bad and all the drama added on top of that made my safe space " the internet" a little less home for me I unsubscribed at that point of time.  I'm not sure if what you said is what you believe and trust issues are something I hope you expect for a little bit but I'm gonna subscribe again another chance is what I want and what we need more on this beautiful interconnected maze of a home  You've got our attention man... Now show us what you've got
Nice!
You have a great talent for film. I'm sorry to hear of your past but happy to hear of your growth journey. Keep truckin'!
we missed you <3
Fix that rowing posture. Legs back arms, then arms back legs, not legs back arms again like you are doing.
Welcome back Ailbert!!
Welcome back Albert. Hope your new journey bring you a new happiness.
I don’t care about the Drama. From a film making stand Point this Video is a work of Art.
Never give yourself to the faceless, gutless trolls on the internet. Glad to hear you're healing, welcome back.
i like how he describes his lows and how his life has been for the last months and its literally the life of an average person xD. Oh no he has to cook his own food ,what a tragedy LOL
this is good, very good, you don't deserve all the hate you got, some of it was of course deserved, but progress is always good, wish you luck for betterment
Really good video, hope u get better
Pathological Narcissism and Emotional Manipulation: The Movie written, directed and starring your neighbourhood sociopath
Forgot about you
I don't even think you'll read this or even care, but I forgive you. And I wholeheartedly believe you'll continue to takes steps in the right direction. You've shown me that people can change with the right circumstances :)
This was such a well put together video. You have an amazing talent.
White Shirts lives matter too 😔
Honestly... I wasnt actually mad at Albert. Yes I felt bad for lily and what she was going through but I wasnt mad at him, i was actually dissapointed and i didn't hate him for it. I let him and lily do what they had to do. I'm happy that lily is now better and that Albert tried his best to  fix his actions. Good luck Albert and be careful!
Welcome back!
Respect for acknowledging your flaws and trying to become a better person ✊
I missed u so much albert!
1:58 Elon Musk doe
This video is very well made, very impressed.
This is pretty neat
Here before 1mil
Don't worry she is happy now with a much better man.
U don’t need to come back until u forgave your self bc we scene what happened to others that did the same thing but they dint try to change that’s why that failed make sure u can show how change I am just young teen that cares for others mental state bc it feels bad to now that you could help rather than destroyed I believe that if you should get second chance but no more bc you’ll be noon that guy f up two times
Alright people, listen up, THIS is how you apologize, you prove you've grown from that experience, and genuinely put your feelings out there, i always hoped albert would come back, and i'm so happy he did it in this way, talking about what he's done, and how he's stronger because of it. The scars can't magically fade away, but noone can disagree that an apology is better than nothing.
Creator burnout, it happens. One has to learn from it. One can grow from it.   Live on, Dream on, Love on brother
Welcome back champion 😎✌️AlbertCD
SO THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT this was one of the best im sorry videos i have ever seen like what else could he say.
I've spend time thinking how much of a ''bad'' person he was. It takes time and maturity to understand people make mistakes, people have their own demons. He is bettering himself and that's always inspiring to anyone struggling with anything.
Glad you're back. No one should mendle in matters of the heart. It might have not been the best way to handle them but there are never bad ways.  Good luck on your comeback.
WOW AMAZING
That was beautiful
Now I'm just waiting for Fed's video...
Second chance.
You get a star from me!
Lmao this is the fakest shit I’ve ever seen.
everyone deserves a second chance. if there's life, there is hope. it's alright to make mistakes as long as you learn from it. never give up on ourselves. it's never too late.
HEY THIS VIDEO IS SUCH A ✨Aesthetic✨ GUYS SHUT UP ATLEAST HES TRYING TO CHANGE
how you gonna live an honest life but the thing that caused this was lying...
Well everyone or everybody deserves a second chance, even me, a nobody, got a second chance even when I fucked up.... 😊
honestly 10/10 execution of a video nonetheless
Everyone deserves a second chance, Albert is a good guy yes he might have done bad stuff but he changed (or I believe so).  Cancel culture is the worst
All the best
Lovely video  Albert even tho you would see hate comments you should always know that some small number of your community will always love you and care for you and support you whatever you had done  Be well soon hope we will soon see that beautiful face that always smiles or laughs whereever is on twitch or youtube or some other some other social media.  Best regards , ItzAlex
Welcome back
I don't understand why people hate on you so much for this, it was bad but it doesn't define who you are. Welcome back! I hope this year is much better for you then last 😊
thank you for reminding me that i need to be more forgiving
this video showed me the genuine you, the real you, have never known this side of you. this is who you are, I hope you can use this as a source for future projects. from the bottom of my heart,  all the best for your future! :D
those things you've done in the past will still be out there. fucked up things dont fade, they stay, and they age. but who cares about that. its up to them to forgive or forget what he did, especially as an otv fan. open mindedness is really needed in the internet nowadays. lets just hope albert the best about his second take on this kind of life.
Hey, life is like that and its a thing we all experience at some point I believe, I personally hate "'cancellation" but it is nice to see you truly did a reset on your life, that you are able to move past on where several have just resorted to commit suicide and not live a life they wanted, may their souls rest in piece. 2020 is truly a shitshow but its nice to see that you are able to look past at and do the things you love and that are important and care for the people you truly have a connection with. Sometimes a flick of a switch, a turn of a key to finally press that reset button is all we need. I also have struggled over shit I have done and mistakes that I still at times melow with, but I learned to move on and just take the lesson, soundly enough someone I loved died this year and our meeting was only sort but the connection was strong, I plan in her honor and the countless others who have saved me to better my life and become the person I always wanted to become. She may have died but I still promise with all my heart to rewatch Howl's moving castle one day, probably when I am old and the calendar full of scheudles, deadlines, and meetings have finally rested and I can just stop and relax at the fruit of my labors. People may scoff at things like "yeast boy" but it is truly the little things that makes our lives fullfilling and make us happy inside, I wish you the best Albert, and I hope for an amazing person to binge watch videos from everyday, you do not need t fullfill that if you still need more time to rest, keep on that self improvement grind and you will get an achievement, and that achievement is called "inner peace". Good luck mate, and may that journey be full of smiles and fortune, I am rally hopeful of the future.
i respect you are taking the steps to become a better person, not a lot of people can do that and its very good of you to do so
This was super well filmed
You're Back!
Leave Yvonne's Starbucks alone.
As a fan of yours and Offline TV's before the split, I am proud that you were so blunt about the fact that you messed up instead of giving a plethora of excuses right of the bat and never really addressing the issue. Persecuting you till the end of time won't do anyone any good but honestly, as fans, we still don't fully understand why you did what you did and what was going through your head as it happened and as cool as the video was it doesn't change much because there are so many apology/comeback videos like it. But what will is your actions going forward from now on because I take everything you said in the video with a grain of salt but honestly hope you are working on yourself and that we will see the progress you say you made through the stuff you put out.
He returns yessss!!! We love you fuck the haters who will try to drag you down!
I was honestly hesitant to watch this video but I  respect it. I feel like you genuinely know you fucked up and are striving to be better. Very well done video.
ALBERT IS BACK
This is a very well-crafted video in all honesty. It won't be able to change the minds of those who have already burned their bridges but it does show that at the very least he acknowledges what has transpired and what he did wrong. Whether you forgive him or not is ultimately up to you and neither choice would be the wrong one. Albert is now searching for his redemption and it's ultimately up to him whether or not he is successfully able to continue his craft while also earning back the trust he's lost not just from others but also in himself. And while I won't tell you that you should forgive him, I will say that continuously bombarding him with what he already knows won't change anything. And if you simply can't forgive him then I ask that you please not bring Lily's name into this. She has already moved on and is in a happier place.   The ball is in your court now Albert, let's see what you do with it.
welcome back Albert!!! Those shots were amazing I couldn't even focus on the dialogue xD
This a good video because of the courage this imparts its viewers. To those who made mistakes or wronged someone...it's all of us.
anyone else see the street sign at 7:11?
I may hate what Albert did. But I was in the same position. I've done the same exact bad thing. Multiple times. But to see someone trying to become better, reconnecting, and realizing how to value the real people that are there for you no matter how fucked up you are makes you wonder if you have the same strength to pull it off if you're in the same situation. People make mistakes. People may not forgive you for what you did. But fuck them.  Albert, when comes a time that some do you wrong. I know you will forgive them. And help them to become a better person.  Cheers for being strong.
I'm rooting for you. So many people can't come out of the place you've been and I want you to know that many people will think the same.
welcome back Albert 😊
you were never cancelled. you did something despicable, understandably got a lot of hate for it, and took a break. personally i have no problem with you returning but this video tries so hard to gain you sympathy and it feels very disingenuous.
What did you even do lmaoo
1:57 those comments are too far.. asking someone you don't know to die is just messed up.. y'all are more angry to Albert than Lily lmao the issue happend last year and they both moved on :)
when feds version of this comes out its going to be so funny
I found that what the people on the internet do are often hypocritical. They hate others on making mistake, sometimes ones that wasn't even severe. And when you try to own up to your mistake and apologize, they don't listen. The truth is, they're there to hate. That's why drama channels exist. They simply hate because that's all that's important to them, that's all they do. They value nothing, so they beat others down so they can feel better about themselves.  What these people on the internet don't realize is that they themselves probably made some mistake, and that's why it's hypocritical of them to do so.  When I learned about the drama, I didn't even hate anyone. Because who am I to insert myself into someone else relationship? I think this is between lily and albert, so if they had forgiven each other then it's fine I think.   Everyone makes mistakes and as long as you continue to improve as a person, then all your mistakes can be forgiven, it's what I think. So let what the people on the internet affect you.
Welcome back Albert
Hi Albert, I don't know much about you but I think its great that you've changed. Not everyone is able to admit their own mistakes and change for the better good. Anyways, i hope anyone who's reading this please show your support to Albert. He's human and human makes mistakes. Cheers!
I subscribe to this channel because of the nice music. Even tho it's suck when he do the "oopsie" I still miss his content music when he gone for a while. I know the past can determine what kind of person are you, but the more important things are what's you doing in now and tomorrow. I know people often only look back because they're afraid to get hurt again, but if we try to make ourselves better each sec, hours, days we can make things go back to the way it is or it can even be better than before. We can't change the "oopsie" in the past, but it's also part us to remind ourselves to not repeat the "oopsie". Accept the "oopsie" and move on by starting to forgive yourself, it's hard but you need to do it so you can let people in your heart. Sorry if my english bad, just want to share to Albert and people who did a "oopsie" but hard to move on. Love you all no h*m*😀👍
Albert, I'm sorry the internet sucks.  I hope you can continue to be happy no matter what you do.  If streaming and making videos makes you happy then do it.  No one should have to give up their friends, career, and the thing that brings them joy all because of one mistake.  I'll be tuning into your streams and vids more often now.  And to anyone who is still shitting on him for this.  You are not lily's bestfriend, you are not even close to her in any way.  Stop acting like she needs you to defend her honor.  Lily forgave him and moved on.  Its been a whole year and you are still butt hurt about something that happened to someone you watch on the internet.  Albert's career was taken from him because of a mistake he made with his significant other.  He lost his friends and was afraid to show his face in public.  He got death threats and more I'm sure he didn't share with us. Stop being a garbage human being and think.  If you cheated on anyone right now would your career be destroyed?   Would you get death threats from hundereds of people you have never met?  Would you be afraid to show your face in public?  I hope you have a good life Albert and I hope people can stop being terrible.  Albert you deserve happiness.  💜
Great Job, Blessings !
coom, get beeter
cheating on lily WeirdChamp
Nice
you have like 0 self awareness lol
Better movie than twilight!
There's a part of me,  that wants to know albert's opinion on the fed situation
Dude, I'm so glad you're back. I know so manypeople are still gonna shit on you, despite how good of an attempt you make to move past/evolve from your mistakes. But ultimately all this is just noise. You should keep on. There are still so many rooting for you. Waiting to see more from you. Welcome Back. FeelsSrongMan.
I never really looked into what happened, but you seem to be doing everything right on your path to being better. I hope you are coming out stronger!
my man
WELCOME BACK!!!!!!!
i think you at least understand what you did and I believe others would understand where you’re coming from. Just keep doing you dud.
ah yes, yeast boy was born.
Such a great video showing what to do when you screw up, the mistake will forever be there, but it will not define you, real change takes time. It's important to see a therapist and talk to your family, they are there for you, even in your darkest times and especially due to 9:12 :)
You did well, happy to see you again 💚💚💚
missed ur stream as backgorund noise, hope u cam back to twitch
W
Weirdchamp what a bad way to try and hype up your next stream just weird dude
Well, good luck. That's all i have for you...
Oops
Welcome back Albert, we missed you
I wont say that i understand what happened because i came into the streaming and OTV community around when this happened but i am glad tat you are working to better yourself, and i hope you become who you want to be someday.
I hope you become the person you truly aspire to be. I know after many screw ups that it is hard to become a better you. So good luck to you and thank you for sharing.
I'm rooting for you! From one person to another, I truly hope your journey is met with kindest because it takes true courage to not just say the things you said, but to live it too. Much love and well wishes from Malaysia.
Everyone asks how is albert? And I totally get it but what about thomas the train he was just burning there
So when’s the Dr. K therapy session??
I feel like content creators should delete Twitter tbh
I'm glad that you started learning to love yourself again. I've been your subscriber since 2014 and I do love all of your videos. They inspire me a lot, they really do. Well, bad stuff happened but you grew up from your mistakes and that's what really matter. I still remember I drew a poster of you and Tiffany on facebook and you did comment on that which made me really happy. You're the motivation that I still keep up with playing the piano and you should be proud that your music do bring joy to people, at least for me! I'm proud of you, Albert, and I know you're gonna be a great artist! I am looking forward to what your upcoming videos! I really miss your collaboration with Tiffany!
I'm glad u have made peace with ur spirit and mustered up the courage to forgive urself. It takes a man to admit and take responsibility for his mistakes and u did it perfectly and I'm proud of u Albert. I'm a nobody but I look up to u as if ur my brother. Much love bro, may ur peace reign eternally :)
you are loved. you are home.
Hey Sleightlymusical, that’s some hard road blocks right there you just mentioned but what’s in the past and all those private matters aren’t something I’m interested and I can only speak for myself. This is my selfish intentions too, always curious about artist fine tuning their skills in their unique ways. I’m keen in seeing content from your awesome music, great cinematography and magic. I’m happy to see what this talented artist gonna bring looking forward and hope you will find that happiness too. Yeeewww 😄
Good to have you back Albert.
WAIT did you actually cut your hand off??!!!!
good luck man
Welcome back No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes but it’s how we own up to it is what truely matters.
People are identified by their mistakes, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Many will see Albert the same way they did when the drama happened, but hopefully some of us will see him as a different person that grew better
3k dislikes are the tier 3 pichu subs
This was an amazing piece to watch. You're right, the world doesn't value growth or change, everyone will always find a reason to shut you down wether it was a mistake a year, ten years or thirty years from now. I can't imagine how much it takes to get back on your feet again but I welcome you back. Your editing seriously dragged me in.
You may hate the guy but artistically this has to be one of the best videos ever made.
The addition of just mentioning lily by only using the flower rather than name dropping her was really tasteful. I appreciate an apology video that isn't just being sorry you were caught, this seems really genuine. I feel that your return will be bumpy but know that at least one random person won't be jumping on the hate train. Good luck!
well i'm fine with any thing he wana do so i'do sit here and watch and maybe support him if possible then.
It's your choice whether or not to support him but it's definitely not anyone's place to punish him for what he has done, especially when the "victim" has moved on. There's no need to constantly remind someone of their sins. In fact, if you don't like him, it's better to click away. Hate is still views and views are still revenue. After all, the opposite of love is not hate but indifference.  If you choose to support him then it's no one's right to judge what you find entertaining. This goes for every cancelled person out there who are planning on making a come back.
Prople don’t realize the title is “hey its been a while” and not “hey i’m sorry”.
this was his alberts way of saying sorry i cant believe there are so many people hating just because he made it a well made video. maybe thats his way of being genuine, maybe this was his way of showing that he really does wanna change and he thought if he didnt put in this much effort people would think less of him but people dont think about that they instantly attack him and call this a publicity stunt without watching the entire video and hearing what he has to say. do well albert. everyone deserves a second chance, no ones perfect let him try again.
please like this comment if you agree, i really hope people can see my opinions and read through.  OTV. Stop being a toxic fan. Say, "wtf no im not?" Why yes, of course you are. Who asked you to speak on behalf of Lily? who asked you to send rumors flying over the internet? Who asked you to defend her by arguing with everyone who liked this video, who comments "this aged like milk" on every liberty comment? Who told you to fill comments sections in his social media, saying "cheater go kys lmao". No one, that's who. No one.   Seriously, hey, people mess up. Let's see. Albert is trying to change, even though he's pretty much been completely cancelled. Not asking for complete forgiveness, not to become bffs with otv again. But to get back to doing what he loves. Why are you asking why he's doing therapy? Why is it a shameful thing to admit going to therapy? Admit it, you're a toxic person who blames people when they are looking for help and change in their lives. Yes, he's not the victim of cheating. He's the victim of pressure and stress.   Generally, don't assume you know what others were going through. "oH i wAs dePpiE aNd i cHeaTed" undermines how much pressure is on when you have a large viewing base. Being depressed isn't a good excuse for hurting others, but we need to try to understand him. btw, again, who are you to comment something like "lol how tf are you supposed to be depressed"? Unless you're Pewdiepie or someone, what basis do you say that off of?   Additionally, if he and lily aren't giving out complete details, STOP ACTING LIKE YOU KNOW COMPLETE DETAILS. s,h  I know I might be really going for it: who are you to say these things? Who are you, sitting in front of your laptop, feeding off of online drama? I'm ashamed to be part of OTV's fanbase because of you. I love so many streamers, they're so funny and wholesome. It's the fans who drive me away from literally every fanbase. So chill out, okay?  Thanks.
I was actually wondering about you a few months back.. "What happend to Albert?.. Is he doing ok?". I'm happy that you've been working on yourself and you seem to be doing good/better..  Resubscribing :)
ok, another thing to add to apologies videos, make them godlike quality and people will get mesmerized and forgot about the hate they wanted to type. nice done albert
The thing about this is that this isn't a simple apology video, you can tell the enormous amount of effort he put into this
ALBERTTTTT
I can 't even dislike this video cause its just 2 well made😣
Only time can tell
welcome back champion!
Hope your doing better. This will probably get lost in a sea of comments but wish you well.
WeirdChamp
haahahahaha cheat funny
looks like you are on your way to become who you want to be. just give the internet a bit of time and i think it will work out just fine, much love
Say what you want, the production value is real high
I ain’t got time for long comments... but boi we will cheer for you until the end
yo this probably took years
I agree with everything you said about starting over, but I believe that the way you expressed yourself is not correct. From my own point of view it looks like you are trying to gain trust by guilt-tripping people into feeling sorry for you. As I said, I think you are absolutely right on wanting to start over and everything else, but the video feels too 'fabricated' and planned, it doesn't feel genuine: you did what you did and you suffered the consequences, just simply admit it and focus on it, not on making it look like you were the one who was suffering the most and lost everything you had. I still believe in fresh starts and I believe it took you a lot of courage to make this video, so kudos for that.
10:07 SONG NAME?!?!?!
I don't know why people are making this into a big deal. Yes he cheated, so what. Dr disrespect did too, and somehow his return stream was bigger than ever. The only reason people care is due to the fact that he was in OfflineTV and was dating another streamer, which complicates things and makes is very "public" even though it shouldn't be and shouldn't have been. He would've been dating a random girl no one knew about no one would've cared. Is cheating ok? No. Is it our business what he does in his personal life? No. Cool for your if you're working on yourself and you're coming back. Never really watched you, but I just think people are making the cheating bigger than it actually is.
Pick a card ✨ Any card ✨ forsenCD welcome back to the champions club 💿
Just do what is right, therefore I forgive what you did last time. It is just unacceptable in both sides. So, in your new start, keep up Albert..
good luck albert, you are not a bad guy, you just fucked up and it's okay
People fuck up, but that doesn't mean they can't change for the better. This video hits home a lot. Welcome back, Albert!
Really glad you took time to yourself and reflected a lot. Of course you don’t need any of our validation but it’s great to see you back and that spark again :) Looking forward to the future my dude!
oh shit peter was talking on his stream a couple of days ago that he was at the otv house  because and old friend came to visit them, hmmmmmmmmm
0:51 i think the flowers are lily reference
I'm glad to see you're still alive and even getting better too! I think you could actually become a better person and I hope your journey produces a lot of growth Albert!!
Pretty damn risky, but good luck man
I’ll be honest, I have no idea who you are only until my friend sent me this video today. This is truly inspiring and gives me hope for my own future of social media and streaming.
More like sleightlymuscular, am i right?
what a coincidence, i just searched up you as I was curious as to how you were going, on a whim I guess I'm just glad that you have taken the time to reflect, and wish for you a fresh start and to continue working on yourself :)
This is some really amazing film-making
hm
Good stuff Albert, nice to know you are still ok. Thanks for the update G
Damn bro this photography is on point!
2.8k of the people y don’t ya give him a chance
I'm proud of you
Wtf i just saw a vid of u and came to check if u came back and here u are
Welcome to the champions club
You got caught xD nice job cheating on someone who really cared about you. A true shame.
this is amazing  the message, the cinematography, everything  i hope you keep moving forward, albert :)
Don't wanna over analyse this but when albert said reconnect with old friends and showed a melodica (i think), thinking that it meant lily made me kinda happy
lmao these people hate albert because of cheating but drdisrespect literally cheated on his wife many times and still “ohhhhh its fine” or like that lmao such a hypocrite
And here comes the comments that saying he's still unforgivable for his past actions.
ew ADULTERER 🤮  a liar will always be a liar, he will probably find another musician bigger than him that he can lich off of
I'm going to put this quote as a reminder.  "Broken bones, destroyed buildings, these things are easily repaired. But broken friendships, broken trust, wounds such as these take much longer to heal."
That was beautiful and I'm really happy that you started to live for yourself. Your happiness comes first, you made a mistake but it doesn't mean your integrity needs to constantly be compromised. Be proud of the work you've done in the past year. You truly deserve it!
What does it mean to be human? Only liars pretend like they've never made a mistake and learn from it. Yes, we should be responsible for our actions, and bear the burden of guilt and shame but to reach out your hand at someone who is trying to humble themselves and be better is also human. Welcome back Albert.
I know we all hated your guts when the shity decisions you made affected a lot of friendships but this is an apology i think most can accept and with the way it was filmed put us in your shoes which showed us an angle we never thought of i have to say i accept your apology
Is that Kyle Landry 8:53 ????
I truly believe you are changing. We are all humans who are still learning and growing from their mistakes. You've fucked up, but that doesn't mean you can't change.
welcome back Albert :>>
Yes.
Maybe we can still see you as a camera man at offlinetv
Basically dude ran out of money and wants his easy job back.....
No ones perfect. It seems Albert has learnt from his mistakes and is well on the way to being someone people should look up to in terms of bettering themselves.
He realized that without his career, he didn't know how to be happy..... Nah fam. You just want easy money for playing sub par violin. Something you don't deserve any more, but will probably get with this woe-is-me video. This video just screams sociopath. At least you got the selfish part right. Your apology showed that you have no remorse for what you did. And this attention grabbing video only solidifies that. I'm sure you'll be fine because the offlinetv community is pretty nice, but I honestly hope you don't come back from this. Like your mistake was on a different level than that of people like Dr disrespect. Lily is the ONLY reason you became popular on twitch. The only reason you had an easy, high paying job. Cheating was much more than just cheating. It showed what kind of person you really are. I could care less about lily's feelings at this point tbh, but you don't deserve this career. People just mistake your shy, loser personality as being nice. Once you got a taste of popularity, that went out the window
welcome back bro
Made a long ass video just to lie and deceit people into thinking you are the victim in this situation
Regardless of what people think it’s not our job to forgive him. If lily and her friends moved on we should too. Nobody can improve with the past being forced on them. Not to say that what he did was good but if he is seeking help that is all he can do.
We love you and your work bud, glad to have you back!
this video is so good idc if youre a super fan of his ex ... you still got to admit that killed this
Welcome Back Albert💚
I didnt think you would come back to youtube, I personally feel like its a bit presumptuous as you could have gotten a normal job, but many people here seem to support you so it will work well for you in the future I guess
This video is gold, everyone messes up at some point in their life but its what route you take after is all that matters and not the mistake.
welcome back albert! glad to see that u are getting better 😁
Glad to finally hear something from you. Best wishes in new projects!
actual eye porn of a video, i didnt catch the drama but im guessing its. cheating all the people that judge are just humans aswell we arent perfect. but i took some nice points from youre video to maybe apply them on myself aswell. again Absolute work of art. i wish you good times and health take care:)
I know we human made mistakes in our life, we are not perfect in the slightest.   That tragedy was the downfall of your carrier, but worry not. If you persist and work hard enough you will get your life back.  This new chapter is a new page in your life, a new opportunity for your life. So Im happy to see you again and to see you doing what you like now.
say what you wanna say, albert swearing is the weirdest thing i've ever heard, but tis cool
Actually a pog storyteller. This content is kind of cool. I mean, the whole cheating stuffs bad, but hot damn would I watch more of these videos.
BRUH nice edit
I never really watched or knew albert but i did hear about the cheating thing. I don't know what it feels like to do such a thing and i don't know what would motivate a person to cheat on someone. I don't know if everything can be forgiven, but i do know that everything can be accepted. So i'm very glad that you have accepted your mistake and are trying to live your life. Just because you made a mistake, doesn't mean that you don't get to live a happy life. This video seems very genuine and even though i don't really know Albert, this video does put a smile on my face.
if someone makes a good apology i'll forgive them, don't fuck up twice
I'm genuinely impressed by the video, I still think you fucked up, but at least you're holding yourself accountable for what you did and I hope you find you own way going back to content creation
I mean the cinematography here is really good, I'll give him that
sometimes I think about Katerino and whether she's doing fine.   now, I think about whether she's watching this video.
was that @kyle landry at 8:51?
Welcome back Albert. Just happy to know you are alive.
Regardless of the past, this video was inspiring yet beautiful.
Peoples changes, but what was the cost?
And now we wait for Fed’s
As someone who was on the receiving end of the same kind of wrong you did, I hope you find the greatest of success in the little things as you work your way back into becoming the person you want to be. Making mistakes is part of being human, but so is learning from them, growing, changing, and turning over a new leaf.   Looking forward to seeing the things you do next! Don’t ever give up.
Yo! So you come back because that mexican guy is deported right? Nice
I Fucking crying watching this.. Welcome back Albert !
Literally using manipulative things for sympathy when the reality of it is you're twisting the scenario to make yourself "be the victim"
What is yr keyboard?
Welcome back Albert.
shoutout to Yeast Boi
Lifes though, we fuck up, we destroy relationships, we hurt ourselves, we grow. You are on the right track and you are inspiring. Being alone with yourself sounds like a horror scenario for me and seeing you do that, tho its not willingly at first, is amazing and like i said inspiring. You got this man. You cant do more than to apologize, whats in the past is in the past. Its a part of your life now but what you make of it is in your hands and it looks very promising :) take care!
Yo Nice Video, But i still wont forgive you for what you did but i probably will watch you again because your streams where good fun and some of the content you make is pretty good. Come back when you are all good.
stinky poo poo head man
Your public image is still tainted, but If you are true on being a better person, I'm sure it will work out. Goodluck Albert.
That was a great video
1) you did a shitty thing, I hope this growth is for real, learn the lesson, don't repeat. 2) this was some excellent storytelling and film making. It feels honest and shows talent. Well done Albert.
I feel like doing an apology video without this kinda effort of production would still be the same thing.
All being said and done, at least he learned from this. One mistake, big or small, does not define who you are. It is what you learn from the mistakes that define what ur personality is like. Everyone is so quick to jump on the hate train of streamers just because their life is more known than others. Streamers aren’t perfect at the end of the day. Everyone has fucked up at some point in their life, so stop bringing up the past. If they learned something from it, that is what really matters. Personally, I really liked Albert, and like everyone else after the incident, my viewpoint was changed. But I’m going to support him again because it genuinely seems like a legitimate apology. And honestly, the Internet is just really thirsty for drama. They bring up stuff that Youtubers and streamers did years ago. Yet I guarantee you that if they had their life broadcasted as much as streamers do, they would get cancelled equally as fast. I’m not saying to forget this or forgive him as it is all ur opinion. All that being said though, I’m glad your doing fine and I hope you bounce back stronger than ever alby!
8:51 Destiny :)
IDC what u did and what u have done. I just care that u r alive and can continue what u were doing.  #Albert_return
Welcome back, champ
wow. I didn't expect that. You are a person I admired back then, I wanted to be like you, and like many others I got disappointed. Recently I've noticed that I was still following you on Twitch so I clicked to unfollow. Forgot about Youtube. Still I wanted to see what you had to say. I don't know how I feel about you now but being in a complicated period of my life, this video made me feel things. Anyway good job on this video it is very well made. And it must've been really difficult to post. Also it got me motivated somehow. I'll try to stay motivated for once. I hope everyone can be happy.
0:52 I know you know
The 2 time is once again forsenCD
I've been following your music for a lot of years from YT. It's refreshing to see your craft again-content wise, past personal matters aside.  I hope you find redemption and what you seek for in your new journey.
Mini Dr Disrespect
fontain 500 dud
People deserve redemption, glad to see Albert working hard at it
ForcenCD
Wait why am I crying
I came in the video expecting to hate it but it really was inspiring.   We all make mistakes and Albert's was a very big and very public mistake.   He is young and I hope he keeps on learning and growing.
I think everyone deserves a second chance, use it wisely and be safe
Aight. Cool. I like you again
hey albert, its been a while
Looking forward to seeing you back man, we all deserve forgiveness and a second chance.
0:51 wait aren't those Lilies? SYMBOLIC Anyways I hope everything will be ok
Good work Albert keep it going
im glad u come back <3
Simply Amazing
ayo how did you edit this these edits are clean
this video alone.  I'm subbing to this guy. I can relate to him too much.
I feel uncomfortable but.... I hope you can do better
I personally can say, I Forgive you. Welcome back
I don't really care about the events you are talking about in your video. After all, everyone makes mistakes, it does not mean we are all terrible people, far from it. I just enjoy what you do and post on YouTube and support you on that if you want to continue. Your life is your own and you are free to live it the way you want.   So keep up the good work, my opinion on you is not going to change, whatever happens. You're a good guy doing amazing things, it is all that matters.  PS : the idea of stickers to encourage children to practice their instrument is a good one. I'll use it with my kids.
its good to see that you are growing from your mistakes and not letting it define you, I look forward to what you have instore for us.
What's the song at 10:33 ?
You're going to get a lot of shit, and honestly, some of it is deserved. It sounds like you know this, and humility is the true path to wisdom. It really seems like you're doing your best to put the pieces back together, and I'll be here again when you're ready to keep sharing your art with us. I can't promise, but I can predict, it will get better, as long as you keep at it. The hardest decisions are normally the ones most worth making.
Wish you luck in your way.
missed you Albie. Any thoughts of coming back to twitch?
This vid just kinda seems so overproduced and dramatised. Like he’s trying real hard to save his image in the most ingenuine of forms. Won’t send hate to the guy but don’t see myself supporting someone who knowingly brings the girl he’s cheating with over so she can interact with his circle of friends and girlfriend (all kinds of fucked up)? Also the amount of people downplaying the action of cheating in the comments make me lose faith in humanity lmao
This is how people should act when involved in drama or after making a mistake, as Albert said its how you act afterwards that matters and take actual time out not a few days or weeks but a significant time to truly learn what needs to be done and start working on it and some people may not want to forget what happened be it to hold you and others accountable or to be dickhead trolls, so well done Albert I hope this sets a good example on how to act in the future
Honestly, I was sad to see Albert go, but the amount of change that he has achieved is incredible. The past is the past and we really can't daunt over those times, we need to start looking forward. A lot of the old friends he had might look at this as a bad try for forgiveness but I can tell that this is genuine. Albert has changed for the better and will continue to get better with time. I'm proud to see Albert back after all that happened and I really respect him for this. It was an incredible way of coming back and showing that you have improved yourself for the better. Welcome back Albert we missed you.
forsenCD HES BACK forsenCD HES BACK forsenCD HES BACK forsenCD HES BACK forsenCD HES BACK forsenCD HES BACK
Welcome back dude
He claims he wanted to please everyone and then cheated to intentionally hurt someone. These holes need some patching.
You can say what you want about his mistakes. But you cant say hes not a brilliant film maker!
we all do dumb shit, sometimes really really dumb shit. Just gotta make it up and be better. Good luck on your journey bro.
I'm genuinely happy that he's back.
Didn’t know you before tonight but I’m looking forward to getting to know you.
When he puts more effort into his comeback vid than his apology. Man I remember that apology being like a halfass overdue homework kind of apology lmao. Sad that I had to give this dude a view.
0:52
It's so weird hearing albert swear a lot... Because im used to the calm persona from him
the lilies....
Help fed too
0:52 and many other people closest to me. with a picture of a lily flower, I love it.
4:00  Entitled much? The reason this might bother you is because the value of your work isnt actually determined by you, and that is what bothers you. Try a shitty 9-5 doing stuff you couldnt care less about, maybe even have a long commute, and then see how happy you are.
AYYY HES BACK
If you had watched it you can clearly see Albert is now starting to TRY and move on from his mistakes. And yes, people DID cancel him for making a mistake that literally EVERYONE makes.  (Not saying what he did shouldn’t deserve consequences) but it’s the fact that he’s a public figure THAT’S why it was such a big deal. Honestly, this video was FULL OF CREATIVITY. Probably one of the most creative videos i’ve seen in a LONG time. Like what did you all expect him to do? Make a basic ass apology video to then have everyone STILL CANCEL HIM?! Because cancel culture is pretty much THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY of this generation. PERIODT. No matter what ANYBODY does, this generation is learning that you can NEVER be forgiven. You can never grow as a human being and as a individual. Like is there a fucking age limit to where you MUST KNOW EVERYTHING AND NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE?! That’s childish and elementary thinking. @sleightlymusical you take your time to grow man. DO NOT let people think you can never be forgiven for your actions. Keep being creative and I can’t wait to see what you have in store. ❤️
Problem is, this could be 100% bullshit. We can't tell over the computer if you've changed or not.  And we wont be able to tell no matter how long time passes unless you fuck up live.
I love how everyone here are very positive, and I go check the Twitter. It's all death wishes there. People can fuck up. People can also work to fix themselves. I was disappointed in Albert. But what's done has been done. Everyone moved on, except those some lowlife people who are watching from afar. So what I can only say is, good luck on your journey of improvement!
Great film, and welcome back.
Glad to see you moving on with your life. Some people might not want to forgive, but hey, they have right to do so. And you also have right to improve yourself and keep living on.
This is insanely cringe. The production quality and effort is too tryhard, it makes him seem very ingenuine. I'm all for apologizing and moving on from mistakes, but this just seems so prepackaged and fake.
Next time he should be even more secretive and use snapchat chat instead where messages are auto deleted. He found a creative way to hide the conversation from her. It was perfectly calculated by him. He got caught because his mistress flashed it on stream for a brief moment. Lets be honest here he didn't want to break up with lily because he thought that would severe ties with OTV. He had ongoing problems with lily for months and he choose to bottle it in. She didnt know there was issues until he got exposed with cheating and they talked it out. Why would he choose to ignore communicating and solving his problems with her and continue a problematic relationship? Why not just end it? He wanted to keep his career and the new girl its selfish. I will not forgive Albert until he admits to why he really did it. He admitted he cheated but thats not the entire puzzle. I won't send him hate but he needs to come clean to his audience who still enjoy his hobbies and still want to support him. I want to support him but he needs to come out truthfully.
HOW WAS THE CHAMPIONS CLUB BRO
Welcome back! Hope you comebacks from everything!
Seeing the lily, that made me feel a lot
Hey Albert, great video. Welcome back!
welcome back
So refreshing to see someone getting 'cancelled' and having a good comeback. At the end of the day, we're all first timers in this so called life and we have the right to fuck up and recover.
I don’t get some people here are saying this is a apology video trying to earn sympathy. This is straight up a video he said is for himself. For his own selfish reason to remind himself he fucked up. This in no way, shape or form, is an apology video after a whole year to the public. His apology was towards Lily and those hurt by his actions.  This is a video of his self reflection. More importantly for himself, another step towards working the better person he wants to become.  His past cannot be erased, it cannot be changed now or ever. This video was to show the self reflection he’s done, more importantly his own reminder as he continues to move forward.
Really good video get well soon
This is kinda cringe
Albert. Thank you for coming back. Thank you for taking care of yourself. One more thing.  Please be happy.
return of the king
Nobody cares you cheated you absolute clown, you also canceled yourself. Now you cry "my mental health" doing a highly produced video showing how bad you have it. "The internet is always hungry for drama" therefore you create a video that is gonna create drama because of your stupid actions (and I'm talking about the things that happened after the cheating, I don't think even 10% really care about that at all since it's a personal matter)  This whole video is just as you say, self pity, self pity for no reason at all, what absolute stupidity.
Every shot of your keyboard looks great, but that last enter click sound I hope was from a different keyboard because lots of rattle. Gotta lube them stabs :)
💿
We still miss you Albert. Your story still goes on and most of us wish to continue going a long with you. You are human.
I bet that fed is going to do the same thing as you did on this video 😂, but all jokes aside that video is really dope and inspiring keep working hard and dont give up💪🏻.
I don’t know what to say
lmao victim andy
"We are not defined by our past, we are shaped by it" I hope you are good.
Woah Bro, that was touching. Wish you all the best!
I’m glad to see you again. Missed yah
Congrats, dude. Best of luck with the new path you're on.
Most people will claim that Albert could rot in the darkest pits of the world. Yet, we’re all human, we all make mistakes, small or large. No one is ever going to be perfect. It’s an incredibly good choice that he had decided to reach out to his audience and explain instead of hiding his face forever, he even took the time to recollect himself, which is incredible! Props to him honestly! I wish you the best of luck on your journey dude ^^
Hey you probably won't read this, however I really looked up to you, I picked up cards because I saw you and the violin too, and one day it changed but you're too right if you didn't come back then I think I'd be more upset so I just wanted to say thank you for setting a good example not just for me but to so many others on what being sorry truly means
I hate you, but I can learn to forgive you.
Self care is the most important thing, and it's good to see you putting yourself first, which is so incredibly hard to do. I'm not an avid fan of your content but I have do much respect for your change and our looks on life. Gl out there again
Bro people actually believe his bullshit. The dude spent probably his whole time off just thinking of how he should film this video. He made this high quality to get him more attention and more subs. He already gained like 2k just for saying pure bullshit in his video.
hey man cheating aint a big deal
To think this was the same dude I binge watched hours upon hours before is actually back. Glad things are looking up for Albert, Welcome back we missed your projects, talents and mostly you Albert.
Holy shit, how can you make such a masterpiece. I want to become a filmmaker one day
I'm glad your back albert
At least we all know that everybody makes mistake.....no one in this world is perfect :)
Well at least he's trying to be better. The only thing I can say is welcome back!
It's absolutely amazing to see so many people being supportive of Albert. Too bad there are still many who keep holding grudges for no reason.
1. Amazing storytelling and cinematography, truly an amazing skill you have there! 2. Sharing this, with cancel culture prevalent, is important, regardless of the type of mistake it shows both how it effects a person and how one should deal with this in a constructive and positive way and come out a better person. 3.  Distinction: What you have done nobody would support, but I will (and I think everyone) support your passion for quality content and genuine effort to become a better person.
Albert slowly but surely you will become a better person
Taken from a reply below:  This is amateur film school applicant/reject shit. Overusing narrative reflection, constantly giving out of context examples of what is being described in the narration, the overtly dramatic monologuous exposition only works in the context of fantasy, it's incredibly cringey and unsettling when he talks about a real-life event like he's a fucking anime character. This whole video screams narcissism.
I sincerely hope you actually develop some form of integrity, because honestly, this whole video still stinks of impression management to save your image.
Interesting

Logan Paul 2.0
I came into this like "eh this guy's probably a douchebag" but this was a really well made video actually. Maybe he's full of shit, maybe he's a man who's learned lessons and grown. I don't really care as long as he keeps putting out content of this level of quality he can be whatever he likes in his personal life.
The quality of the video is some fuckin high end electronic announcement shit
This is some logan paul apology shit. Nice manipulation though, people are now making this kind of apology video instead of the classic sitting down, deep sigh and pandering. Effort, but no. Dont come back.
Look who's back in the game .  Welcome back champion 🥇
Hey Albert, watching this was extremely eye-opening and quite moving on how much you have reflected. No one is perfect and everyone is subject to make mistakes in their life... at the end of the day, we are all human. It's a relief that you have taken different measures to help your mental health. I am truly hoping for the best and will be looking forward to your future content!
everyone fucks up the difference is how people fix their mistakes i believe that you will be able to continue making content once again stay strong.
Take it easy on yourself, and keep learning from your mistakes. You got this Albert :))
I belive that you are good man at heart and wish you all the best
the time and effort put into this video and the story behind it made me shed a tear
The best comeback video I’ve seen in a while. Not just the video but the message it has.
Everyone fucks up. For us to admit our mistakes, learn, and change is a one big step forward into becoming a better person. Everyone deserves recovery even for people whove caused hurt. There is always space for improvement and self betterment.  Congrats Albert! I wish you the best of luck on your journey:)
Yes Albert ur back lets go baby
Welcome back Albert
Glad to see you back Albert <3 Can't wait to see what's to come for you!
tldr: Albert learned how to make coffee and is now super sayan swole
would be better if you just didnt come back
Mistakes happen. Sure this was a big fuck up, but it's a lesson. Welcome back, and I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother. I pray for you being able to return :)
Bro THIS is not suppose to be an apology video, but a video of what happened to him after the controversy and what he has done to change and become a better human being
great to see you back, can't wait to see more and music
That's was a amazing video to watch
missed ya bud :(
i never watched you but this is what i call content from the heart
Great production value. What a narcissistic and emotionally manipulative video though. Not impressed.
This is such an incredibly made video. I can relate to every single feeling you shared, the highs and the lows...always know that you are not alone. Comming out the way you have, gives all of us, who are going through/ went though the same thing as you, some hope that things will be better in the end. Stay strong.
Really artistic! Enjoyed watching!
This is wierd
Kudos to your redemption, welcome back.
I mean am I missing something? You cheated on your gf right? Like that happens to millions every day. I don’t expect you to apologize to me for having a life and making your own choices.  I’m being legit. What is a detail I’m missing? It’s hilarious to me that viewers can be so weak minded that they expect an apology from someone who will never even speak to them on a personal level.
Amazing video Albert.
I loves the video Albert. Happy to see you again, welcome home❤️
this is art   amazingly edited and a great story   you have my respect
Wow youve changed so much, went from not liking hugs to getting a dirty dog!
This was good ngl
Honestly this was so fuking good!
Ok I agree to the part of him making a huge mistake and cheating on Lilly but that's it? I thought it was more than that.  I Should really stop looking at twitter. The video was so fucking good
we are still here, we believe in you. everyone makes mistakes dont forget that. :)
I think it's very manly of you to come back and speak out and opening some subjects to the public that are personal to you. We all mess up on different levels all the time some big some small it creates chaos no matter what yet we have to overcome those to push on. I hope if your to continue content we can support you as a community and I don't mean mean simp, but as a small southern community would their members. Thank you Albert for this video and hope you smile more and more each time you look in the mirror the positive reinforcement helps so much as well 💜 #sleightlymusicalarmy
This was actually awe inspiring to watch. We all make mistakes, we're only human.
OOOOOOO, what a year. And people say 2020 can't get any crazier!
That was a damn good video.
Thank you for coming back Albert.
Wow Albert is so cool. This is actually inspiring. Believe in healing yall and show em that you can become a better you
Im not gonna say anything else besides alright
You’re a good dude no matter what
Damn.  I needed to hear this at this very moment.  Thank you Albert.
I'll take Albert, amidst everything that has happened, over XQC any day.
i mean im seeing alot of hate comments but come on no matter what he did people where gonna make fun and meme on him
hi
better apology than alinity
i don't really know but i don't wanna disrespect him in any other way but... can anyone tell me what happened?
<3
Welcome back Albert!!!
U know ur true friends only when ur going through ur toughest period in life.
Welcome back BAABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
U been Working on This vid for awhile
holy shit
This is the first apology video that actually felt real. Not the same 5 min bs you see with every content creator. Well done man, but like you said you have more left to go.
MY MAN, THE TWO TIME IS BACK ✌️😎
Yes Albert!!!!!! I miss your covers!!!
I'm so sorry that lily pretended to not like hugs and other forms of physical contact with you for many years while she was sleeping with a friend behind your back. This video is right about one thing and that is you are indeed selfish and playing victim to your fans that supported you and lily , without giving us a proper apology.
i think he really mean it from the bottom of his heart for making mistake and hurt people’s feeling. but to make it into an apology video (kind of) where he edit it a lot is a lil too much for me whether he’s being sincere or not. Don’t get me wrong I do find the video is pretty good to watch and i like it. I hope he will learn through this experience and move on.
Welcome back Albert. Glad to be back.
There’s instagram and youtube who will support you... And there’s twitter... Fucking. Twitter.  Anyway, good to see you back Albert. Let’s move on from that.
Welcome back
Welcome back Albert. Good luck with your future endeavors
So inspirational.
how self absorbed do you have to be to make this type of video. I could only watch 2 mins of this cringe fest. Before people say "Oh but DrDisrespect did the same and he is still well liked" yeah he owned up to it, took a break and came back. He didn't do no "look at me i'm the real victim also here is a high quality production of why you should like me again." This narrative feels manipulative. Just say you fucked up and move on, some of the internet will still talk shit and troll because of what you did. That's how it works. It's an inevitable flaw. Also you didn't get "cancelled" no one created a thread on why you are "cancelled" or did a #AlbieIsOverParty. They just shit on you because you happened to cheat on someone who some of the internet favoured.  Just get over it.  . . . . .  also  forsenCD PICK A CARD ✨ forsenCD ANY CARD ✨ forsenCD THE 2 OF WIVES? ✨ forsenCD EXCELLENT CHOICE ✨ . . forsenCD I LIKE HER 🌸 BUT I ALSO LIKE YOU 🥑 WITH MY MAGIC SPELL 🎩✨ I CHOOSE TWO 👰👰 :)

What’s with all the essay in the comment section?  Like chill the fook out and say it like YUP I CHEATED AND NOW IM MOVING ON
Honestly, Albert, good for you. I can only imagine how you must have felt getting all the negative comments. I'm by no means condoning what transpired, just saying you probably didnt quite deserve to be treated the way you were. I'm glad you've sought out help from a health professional, and am happy that you're spending your sessions effectively! Good luck with your journey. To the core, i believe you're a good guy, and you'll become a better you.
it's nice hearing from you, welcome back.
Umm how could you do that... He is closest to you and you eat him like that, he trust you D: . . . . . Welcome back Albert. Hope you be better man. Looking forward for it.
Welcome back Albert. I'm happy you're striving to become a better person for yourself first. Healing may begin small but the first step towards it is always the most important I think. Awesome video and thank you for sharing so much with us! <3
Twitter is more toxic than youtube and instagram
Hey does anybody know the end song?
You weren't hanging out with the girl you cheated with during that social isolation?
I’m extremely uncomfortable
;v; these comments are so wholesome compared to the twitter ones bahaha
No cap i just want to see violin videos
you should delete this
victim andy
this felt like i was watching a movie. very well crafted video. even if he just worked in a different field that wasnt his own content creation he would be very successful in life. this is just another hurdle
We believe in you! And by "we" I mean the people who believe that you changed and realized what you did, and that you can come back as a new person.
it is still ur fault anyways
Damn its look like a trailer for a 2020 movie 😂
Welcome back albert
did you just brag about making coffee?
forsenCD My man
It's good to know Albert will be back and will try to be a better person next time. Hopefully he won't make the same mistake again.
Filmaker, magician, violin master and most importantly , member of Champions Club , welcome back Alber forsenCD
This is the most narcissistic shit I've seen in a while. Well done.
This gave me chills Albert welcome back!
hey Albieu should have learnt to cook her dishes, it'll be a crying shame if u don't
I really want to believe this video was sincere so you'd stop making bad choices. Because living the life of a coward is no life at all. I know from my own experiences.
Welcome back buddy♡
Best of luck to you Albert. May you find happiness again one day.
Sheeesh mans made a whole ass movie

redemption arc
There's no harm supporting a person who's changing for the better. But continuing to remind someone of his/her past mistakes, only increases the risk of them falling back into their dark past. That's why, forgiving is always the better option. So forgive others, and forgive yourself.
Welcome back albert Keep doing things that u like and love  Don't forget some people still forgive u that's why we still love u, support u and we believing you WE LOVE U ALBERT CHANG!
I discovered you, and your past mere hours ago. I came here to see what your prior content was like to find out you uploaded a video just 18 hours ago. Dude, this video moved me. Everyone has a skeleton in their closet and when you open your life to the internet your closet comes with it. Your action of posting this video shows so much strength and courage, and I'm excited to see what comes next.
People swear like this guy fucking killed someone lol.
ta bien compa, usted solo tome aguita <3
We forgive you, Albert.
Ya know, part of me is still disappointed for what you did back then, you really did fckd up, but part of me also been waiting for you to come back, cause I never hated you in the first place, even after you fckd up And I shouldn't have any hate on you, we all fckd up sometimes But after seeing this video, I'm so glad I got to see you again, welcome back Albert
i honestly couldn't care less about who you sleep with, great to have you back
oh. hm. did not expect this.
ooooff, cheating and trying to gaslight youtube

Great job, Albert! This video is beautiful and heartwarming and you are a true artist. It takes a lot of strength to be able to recognize areas of improvement. I'm glad you're continuing to move forward and I hope you know that there are people here to support you! We all can improve. Thank you for sharing your story!
Nice video Albert. Very emotional and well made. I missed your streams and you in general. Its been too long since you left the picture, but I am patiently excited for your return. I hope you are doing well during these times, and of course I wish you the best on your big return back to streaming!
Welcome back
People make mistakes, no one is perfect. welcome back Albert
FUCKKKKKKKKK I've been waiting for this missed you
Hey. You fucked up. But it's always nice to see someone recover and be better
Ok but the cinematography is so great!
Wow, amazing Albert.
I support you, support this. Canncel culture is stupid a lot of the time, granted you deserved it, but what's important is that you grow from it. Good luck man, I hope you are well and do well.
almost a year
Jesus this a bad video, just make an apology and move on
I don't know why, I know I shouldn't feel this way but I feel like I can't let go just yet. His presence still sicken me somehow. Is it the phrasing? Is it the editing? Is it just my bias? I feel like this is, again, strangely insincere. I can't. I will leave for the time being. But I really do hope someday I can listen to your music again. You were my favorite.
Don’t really like what you did but this video is very good film making so good job man
it take balls to admit your mistakes and strive to be a better person, we love you albie!
I’m so happy you are back!!! Your music makes me  so so happy 😀
hop everything go good all love to you <3
Good for you man, for real.
He got dealt a pretty heavy blow for cheating compared to the everyday person who's life is not publicly on the internet. That of course gave him a bigger lesson learned then most. It was between him and Lily, and everyone here who is leeching the emotions of that are just fishing for fake connections and drama. Leave them both be.
forsenCD Welcome back
May you reach your goal, keep up with what you're doing. We're proud of you, everyone makes mistakes. And as you said, what matters is what you do after it.  It seems that you learnt your lesson and we should move on from it all. We love you Albert❤We truly missed you as well! Glad to have you back
The grandma part really rubbed me the wrong way. Christ.
Welcome back albert. You got this man!
Keep the spirit up Koko Albert, dont lose the hope
Hope things work out for you, as you seem to be now. If you really meant everything you say in this video, that's cool with me.
The moments of elitism over things really threw me off, like bragging about coffee and shitting on starbucks lol But glad he's working to better himself.
SOCIOPATH LULW
Tf is this
wow this video is inspiring tbh currently im in a depress situation and same as albert i always keep people happy but not me so i decide to be gone from social media and then focus to my self and yeah is quite struggle idk what i want to do idk what make me happy but maybe after watching this video i finally can get a fresh start and what to do thanks albert and good luck
Your creativity and art is very very wonderful, Albert. Look at this video, look at all your creations. I wonder if you had fun creating this :) I can see lots of your splendid ideas and styles in this cinematography. I see a lot of YOU in this whole autobiography. And I really like that.
This. Forever this. Albert, your talent and creativity are as clear here as they have ever been. Even back in OTV, I know we all saw your potential as a creator, and to see you return eager to work again is truly an inspiration. It's good to see you doing so much better and seeing it has brightened my day for sure.  Here's to a new beginning and great content!
Everyone deserves to be forgiven. Welcome back albert. I will still continue to support you and your work.
Welcome back Albi
I support you. No matter what!
It's great that you're back and the comments really should be talking about it, but this video quality is nuts wtf?
Welcome back, buddy. I missed you.
Ooohhh nnnooooo  Anyways...
Albert I'm not that familiar with your content or who you are but I am a big fan of otv and I know what happened not to long ago and I just half to say it's ok time has passed and I hope you doing good I believe you changed and I hope you can live a nice life from here on out learning from your mistakes
i cheated. feel sorry for me.
Some Patrick Bateman type shit lol. The platitudes in this video are numerous and wtf was that performative shit at 0:52. Even if the video was top quality production it just feels wrong to imagine this guy filming himself being sad and shit.
Needed this.
2:19 This is a mood. *Welcome Back, glad to be here to see your new chapter*
I subbed to this channel after you won a Mismag contest — and I didn’t know how large you or your following had become. I think that this video shows your humanity and personality better than any other. The flaws are right on display, but you’ve made them a meaningful part of the art.
This is so well made!
Welcome back we missed you
So well put i wish you the best
Welcome back
Now how will feds return video turn out . It def won't be as eloquent as this .
We all screw up in life. And sometimes the memories of what we did wrong haunt us. But I found a solution that worked for me. It helped me wipe the slate clean, as it were. What worked for me is the exercise of retrospection. If done properly and consistently, you can accomplish more in one life with it than it might take you multiple lives to accomplish without it. Read about it here:  http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/magen114.htm  You don't have to go through life carrying your burdens forever. We all have our crosses to bear, but there is a way out. If you "clean" the seed atom, then you will truly be free. Good luck in your journey. I hope you can find peace.
This is like an art project created by a high schooler. A highly edited video filled with metaphors and of course, Victim Victor. Actual pain coursed through my veins.
I'm glad despite it all, you focused more on you. I always looked up to you, people make mistakes. That's easier said than done I know. But I care more about what makes you smile and happy everyday, and not the people who wishes down on you because I don't think anyone deserves that not even you.   This video is for you, and ur reflections. But it is also a video to help push through and start a new beginning. Ur talented Albert, and I hope you keep doing more for ur own happiness.  Love ya
8:53 IS THAT STEVEN FUCKING BONNELLI
I'm not really that in touch with the events and the controversy that got you here, but I just want to say, that was really bloody good. The cinematography and the symbolism presented in this felt like it was something I wanted to analyze that I wanted to reach inside and look for every detail. Disregarding the details though it pains me to do so, reveals a video that forces empathy not in a way that is overbearing but that conveys the emotions portrayed in a masterclass of story telling, the ability to not manipulate but guide gently the viewer down the path of redemption along side you is cathartic. This is a video to be proud of, redemption is a long and hard path, but if you keep going you can make sure that you have improved as a person and as an artist.
I'm so sorry you got cheated on Albert. I hope your road to recovery wasn't met with to many challenges.
Welcome back Albert!
i can support anyone who owns up to their mistakes and tries to do better. hope to see more from you in the future
Man just make the apology video and move on stop using this shit as content
Albert, this comment is directly to you.  Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone deserves to be able to move forward with their life and grow as a person. People absolutely can change for the better and make amends for what they've done.  However, cheating is not a 'mistake'. This was a decision. This was MULTIPLE decisions to actively lie, deceive, and manipulate someone knowing full well that what you were doing was wrong. This is the kind of action that has the potential to create lifelong trauma, emotional scarring, and self-doubt within someone which will never leave them. Luckily Lily is strong and was able to find new love so soon.  You have done a lot of thinking during this time. You recognize that what you have done is wrong and I am convinced that you won't do the same thing again. I am glad that you are seeking therapy. I am glad that you are working to improve yourself. I am glad that you are trying to become a better, more empathetic person.  Yet this situation happened *LESS THAN A YEAR AGO*. Working out, brewing coffee, making sourdough bread, and finding a few new friends is not enough to transform your worldview.  You said multiple times that you made this video for yourself. If that was true, why upload it? Are you still seeking validation from others in order to forgive yourself? Have you indeed truly changed if that is the case?  I offer my condolences to your grandmother. I wish you felt more regret about not telling her the truth. You can't hide behind lies in order to protect those around you.  You are extremely talented. You have more skills in violin, cardistry, and filmmaking than I have in any facet of my life. I hope that you continue to follow your passions and find satisfaction in your work. But I would be disappointed to see you try to come back as a public figure and try to return to your previous life as if nothing happened. Especially not so soon.  All that this video has proven to me is that you are more talented in making videos than I previously thought. Very impressive quality and storytelling.  Although if this is meant to be some "I am well on my way through my redemption arc" video... Good luck in your endeavors, but I will not be supporting you.
First off, this is an amazing video. Probably one of my favorite videos I have seen in a while. It is well-edited and well organized. With that being said, it is just a story and a youtube video. I am really happy with the thought that Albert has put into this video and the compassion he shows for the things he loves. I really hope he is true to his words and has changed. I believe that everyone can change for the better but in some cases, it is harder for others.
I'm speechless. amazing video, hope you're getting better!
Okay without all the memes, this video is shot and edited fucking beautifully. It's like a short movie.
...
Anyone else get Mr. Robot vibes from this for whatever reason or is that just me?
I’m waiting for offlinetv reaction, I hope they accept you back and be who you are.
I know this isnt really a good time but holy fuck this editing is good.
For the record NOONE HERE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT ALBERT, HIS LIFE, OR THE COMPLETE STORY. Its amazing how some can come back from a fall, both lily and albert. But a psa for people who are trying to prove something,  we can comfort and understand the person, but  do not make a  controversy, or argument over someone elses situation.
Wow, cheating on Lily was the best thing that ever happened to you.
The champion is back pog
Lmfao
I came in here wanting to hate it, but I can't. It has amazing editing, great camera work, and looks great. However, it's beautiful in that it is just a man talking about owning up to his mistakes, finding what he truly values about life, and wanting to become a better person. And I think that's all that matters now in this situation, whether people dislike it or not. Good luck, Albert:)
Very inspiring and insightful video
Where's the sigh???
Guess he truly did level upped
Yessssssssss he is backkkkkk😭😭😭😭😭
We all make mistakes You have the choice to change Or to remain the same And there are some point in our lives we f*ck up But not everybody realize that so Knowing that you made a mistake Will make you know what will you do next time You are a great content creator and keep moving forward!!! Wish you all the best
Welcome back Albert :)
I believe in you
Albert please don't be hard on yourself and I'm a new sub here but I am familiar with offlineTV I'm a fan of all the members.
Dude. What?? Just lay out the facts and apologize, the people who’ll forgive you will forgive you. Go unfiltered and apologize to all parties involved. Better than making this. Bad apology video, but cool video.  Edit: He’s forgiven if he acknowledges his mistakes. If he truly wanted to change and did change, he’s forgiven.
idk whyyy but i love his voiceee. it's so soothinggg

ForsenCD pick a card
Welcome back, Albert! Good to know you've been taking care of yourself after what happened, and thank you for sharing your story with us again. I, too, have recently been going through similar circumstances. Really heartwarming to know when you're not alone in dealing with personal issues. Looking forward to seeing more from you!
Psychopath
forsenCD THE TWO OF WIVES
What you did was wrong, but I don’t think you are a genuinely bad guy. I believe you actually learned from what you did rather than just make a bullshit apology.
Dear Albert. This was a great video. The first time I had heard what happened I wondered how you felt. The fact that you didn't throw more flame into the fire made me worried but at the same time happy that you didn't stir up more drama. This video made me realize how much of a great person you are. Even though what you did was bad, you and anyone can come back from it. We all just have to find our plan. Much love Albert <3
Everyone makes mistakes, all that matters is that you understand what you did wrong and grow from it. I don't expect everyone to forgive you, but I believe in you, I've always loved you and your content. I'm hopeful you'll become the better person you want to be, and I'll continue to support you as a viewer <3
I am just so proud you being able to get up and doing your best to move forward. We will look forward to your future projects.
this is what we should strive to be. we acknowledge our mistakes, and walk forward. they will always leave scars that you can't hide, but thats okay. with every shadow, theres a light. welcome back albert.
ur heart reveals more than anything can. fight for it. god bless, much luv bro
straight from the sociopath's playbook, garner sympathy, seem relatable, manipulate audience into guilt. good job albert, it worked.
Holy shit this video gives me fucking Katerino vibes. Bringing shit up that has nothing to do with the problem and play the victim card XD
I like this
Good luck, I hope you do it.
as serious as this video was, and how happy i am for you that you've turned your life around, i was just waiting for him to say something like: "but hey, at least im not fedmyster"
just found out about you and idc what you did, nor do i even care to find out. thats between you and her and ii hear lily already forgave you and thats what matters most. i remember seeing some of your clips on twitch compilations now that i think about it... glad youre back bro, cant wait to see you on the site again - subbed, and following now
Never hated you. Or disappointed in you.
Ok new day new life and let the past be past
When people hit they lowest point They open up to change
I gotta say the production quality and film making that went into this video is actually pretty damn good
<3
Albieeeeee ✨✨😻😻😻 Ohhh Im happy 🎉🎉😭😭🤍🤍
We are all imperfect and blinded by emotions. Mistakes happen, but the next step after receiving forgiveness is repentance. Remember that.
so in the last scene Albert says "may the person you find be the person i resolve to become" if this is for part is for lily then that means Albert has to work to become a cracked out midget  robot maker gamer boy
7:18 what is the name of the song?
that was beautiful
I hope to see good things from here on out  Don’t prove me wrong Albie
is it just me that finds this funny and cringy NO HATE or maybe, it's an indecisive opinion y'all
Just know that the public image of you being this wholesome person was shattered. Continue doing what you love keep showing off your hobbies and talents just don't pretend to be someone you aren't. Be the real you.
The reaction on twitter vs youtube is outstanding wow
This is just great storytelling.  Even though I didn't get cancelled like you, a lot of what is in this video is relatable and things that, even myself, needed to hear. We all have troubles, we all become sad. We all at one time feel like we have nothing left like we're worn out from work or school but in the end we all make mistakes along the way. No matter what it is.   I failed going to a study abroad trip in Paris last year, before the pandemic even started. Around the same time troubles started for you. Needless to say, I also spent everyday oversleeping and overeating in self-loathing. I'd get up everyday, get on my computer to play games so I didn't have anything else to feel and eat in between when I needed just so I could sleep and do it again. I've avoided graduating with my bachelor's degree due to owing my school money for my visa trips and plane tickets to Paris. I quit my job just before then and never went back. Nothing changed for a long time. When the pandemic began, it gave me more of a reason to continue being a shut-in and distance myself from others because it was actually a requirement now. I've been living the same boring life for a little over a year now.   I'm glad I watched this video. It's given me reason to get back to being myself, to find motivation in starting over and to forgive myself.  Thank you Albert, I hope you continue to grow and thank you for reminding me that I deserve to grow as well. I'm sorry for your loss, that part made me cry because I also lost my grandmother and all it did was make me think of her and how I wish I spent more time with her before she was gone.
Albert 😭😭 welcome backk... I've been waiting for so long... really really glad to hear you again >_<
Besides what he did, time passes and the mistakes will always be there, and its normal, he made a mistake and he payed for it, now, lets see what he is going to bring to us, forgive his past, and see his future. Btw, a incredible video, keep it up, you are really talented and i hope will see more of you, even when everyone was among you, some people are here to support you again. Not as a OfflineTV member or as Lily boyfriend, we are going to support you as Albert, Sleightlymusical.    Make you grandmother proud.
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Good to see u turned into like this.Good Luck and Atb in future
I've been waiting for your return my King
Ew
Thank God you are back! Missed your contents.
Glad to hear you're doing good Albert and glad to know all the process you've been doing to be a better person, I'll be looking for your return and your future projects, love you Albert
lol cheater
We support u even u fked up
weirdchamp
The artistry and finesse within the creation of this video just reflects a conceited/pretentious personality
Sleightly yeast boy 😀 really good video look forward to your content in future.
👁👄👁
i hope fed can do the same
Hi Albert!  I'd just like to say...I was one of those people that hated on you very much when that event first happened. Even though what you did was bad, no human being really deserves the kind of awful words you received. I'm really happy for you. It's amazing how you were able to turn such a horribly negative situation into something positive. From the bottom of my heart I hope you'll continue to work on finding a place that will make you happy. Also that you'll keep on learning from your mistakes! I'll forever miss you and Lily playing music together but I'm excited to see what you do in the future ^^
Welcome back :D We miss you I don't care about the drama and more we're humans we make mistakes, its normal to be hated and loved as long as you moved on and become a better person. No matter what you do i will always support you. you give me calm with your music, you give me amzement with your magic, and you give me happiness with your videos, like this 1, keep up the good work. And I support you until you become a better person <3
You already know fed is going to make a video like this
So I searched up Albert Chang on Google, and I got some Tennis player.
It’s good that your back
YAYYYY ALBERT'S BACK! WE MISSED YOU! MUCH LOVE MUCH LOVE!!!❤❤❤
ur a complete psychopath bro this is so obviously meant to manipulate people into feeling bad for you. using your grandma’s death for an apology video is so gross it makes me so sad that people can’t see what ur doing
I can't anything except the fact that this video was so well produced. The quality is incredible. It made me cry, and I don't know why.
A truly badass apology video, if I can call it that. It felt like an exclamation of renewal. Something new and better rising from what once was there. A man who is ready to set off a new journey of self exploration. Not forgetting what he has done in the past, and learning from that. He didn't just use that time to forget about what he did and move on. He used it as a fuel to better understand what was wrong to begin with and to propel himself into a new way of living. The internet is a cruel place full of people who think that their opinion on someone else's life matters just because that person chooses to make it public. All these people who said some pretty dark shit that would make the strongest willed person question whether or not they really are strong willed. He took that and ran with it. I have nothing but respect for Albert. Although it isn't my place to judge, I forgive him. I won't forget it, but that's not a bad thing. It's a basis for judging his growth in relation to his lowest point. When he's grown so far from that point that it feels like just a miniscule point in his life, that is when I will forget about it. Because at that point it's just dwelling on something, which isn't healthy. So to anyone who still feels the need to try and bully him back off the internet because they're STILL butthurt about it. Calm down and reflect on what that means about you. Why your opinion about someone else weighs so heavily on you, and fills you with so much anger and hatred towards another human, that you feel the need to cause them that level of pain. If the person who was directly hurt by his actions can forgive him then why shouldn't you? You don't need to guard them, it's not your place. YOU don't have a duty of care in this situation. This is all theoretical because I haven't seen any comments like that yet. However, I've been on the internet long enough to know that it's in there somewhere. Its just inevitable. Anyways, I've said a lot, but I've got an assignment due in about one hour... why wouldn't I procrastinate? I'd rather write a thesis paper about existentialism, entropy, and growth as it relates to an internet personality and content creator than sing in front of a camera for 20 minutes. So if you're reading this then you must be procrastinating too because why the hell would you want to read this much on a YouTube comment? Jeez dude.
My only problem is that the cheating wasn’t something that just happened. He actively tried not getting caught and the way he did it just sucked. Also this video is of course nice to look at but I fail to see the point. If he actually made some changes that’s good for him but it feels like he’s trying to make people pitty him it’s kinda weird to be honest.
Welcome back.
This video makes me want to apologize for getting cheated on.  lmao
Fed taking notes...
Aaaaaaaa finally !!! Welcome back broooo
My only problem is that the cheating wasn’t something that just happened. He actively tried not getting caught and the way he did it just sucked. Also this video is of course nice to look at but I fail to see the point. If he actually made some changes that’s good for him but it feels like he’s trying to make people pitty him it’s kinda weird to be honest. This cancel stuff is also bullshit no one deserves to get shit on and talked about like that online but yeah I don’t think I will be back for his stuff any time soon
The most important part of this video to me is that Albert shares that he is seeing a therapist and they are helping him through this. Everyone, and I mean everyone, could benefit from talking to a good qualified therapist. Not every therapist is a perfect fit for everyone, but I encourage you all to walk down this path of strengthening your mental health. There are lots of free resources online as well to get started. Thank you for sharing Albert, I'm sure we'll be seeing each other around.
So when's the return stream?
emotionally manipulative cringe.
Life is always full of surprises. You can never expect someone to be perfect. All of us has our own good and bad qualities and thats what makes us humans. We make mistakes to learn from them. We earn achievements to remember them. Life is full of surprises as one should say.  Once you make a mistake, it doesn't mean it'll stay as a stain in your canvas, thus you can turn it to a beautiful artwork which all colors of your life are involved. I believe in you Albert. If you feel bad about it then try to repent for it. We all deserve to be forgiven... it just takes some time though. Good luck to you Albert and to your career in life.
When he said his grandma died, the part reallly got me
Nice to see you are ok
I somehow watched this video, but let me tell you something: if YOU cheated on SOMEONE, your video should not be like "I WAS... I AM... MY PAST...". Do you realize that YOU hurt SOMEONE and not the other way around? WHAT IS THIS VIDEO? When I watch this video, it ONLY shows me that you have learned ZERO. YOU STILL don't understand what YOU did wrong. You try to justify your wrong-doing and gain empathy by talking about your passed away grandma and all the other shit while you have ZERO empathy. This video is so narcissistic, at best it apologizes that you got caught... So my advise for you: Watch this video, there you have it what is wrong with YOU. THIS VIDEO is not apologizing anything. I am not mad at your or anything. I don't know you, I don't know who you cheated on. But everyone deserves a second chance. And that is why I tell you the truth: You need that in order to change. Because this VIDEO shows that you have not changed. Good luck in the future
U did what you did and you can't change that .. we are all  human .. we make mistakes .. some live and learn and some don't .. i just hope this is a learning and turning point in your life.
You are so talented, don´t let the judgment of the third people (social media) get you, not doing nothing and judge is always easyer
Hope u recover
I’m glad your back, it’s the best thing that happened this year. Welcome back
It's honestly stunning that you have learned to stand on your own two feet again after all what happened. You've been trying changing yourself to get better after all that drama...  I'm a strong believer that (almost) everyone should have the possibility for a second chance. People can change and, as you said in the video, they'll do a life long.  I'll be honest, I unsubbed and unfollowed after I heard what happened but I'm ready to forgive, even if I shouldn't be allowed to forgive since I haven't been part of what happened.  You're working on yourself and so should we. Welcome back, Albert.  May this be a new start for you man.  Don't fuck it up, because people are putting their faith in you.
Welcome back
We missed you Albert, nobody from social media could ever understand the reality, they souldn´t judge at all
bruh
I mean, this is pretty hardcore manipulative.
I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.
No matter how much he screwed up, we all have to start from a blank page once! :)
Came back from being cancelled and put down by many people. Respect. 💕
F off victim player
7:42 Look at the road sign.
This man is such a manipulator lmaooo, he really depicted himself as the victim when he’s the one who caused harm.
The editing good good
This apology video is so good it's almost comical and in a way that makes it bad and makes it seem less genuine, kinda like an expertly crafted piece of propoganda.  At the same time, it does speak for his filmmaking expertise but yeah not exactly what you're looking for in an apology.
Wow. This video is so good and full of content. Incredibly masturbatory.  Love it! Pour over coffee and bread making are real signs of self improvement. This was a great ad. You will definitely win people over with this great content with the perfect amount of sympathy fishing. You should look into making political campaign ads because this was great emotional manipulation. He has my vote!
Welcome back!
Next time don't use gdocs :)
i was mad at u for the longest time bc i saw myself through you and saw that  you fucked up and went silent. but now to see this it’s really great i hope for the best in ur journey
I mean cool but you kind of just tried to get sympathy the whole time.
This is by far, the best apology video I've ever seen. I'm honestly impressed how much you have grown. I believe that you truly do deserve a second chance. Welcome back Albert.
Hey albert i just wanna let you know that  ive been waiting for your return and im really glad that you are doing better now. yes i know you f up but everybody deserve a second chance SO PLEASE KEEP WORKING HARD FOR WHAT YOU LOVE AND WE WILL ALWAYS BE HERE FOR YOU. WE LOVE YOU!!!!
This is the weirdest video I've ever seen. I mean, it's incredible, but also... very Patrick Bateman.
GASLIGHTING, CHECK SOCIOPATHIC HEART STRING TUGGING, CHECK USING BOTH DOGS AND YOUR DEAD GRANDMA TO FARM EMPATHY, CHECK
YOU NEED A PSYCHIATRIST NOT A THERAPIST
Straight up sociopathic tendencies served up on a plate. The emotional manipulation is insane. Grow up dude, this is baby-ass shit.
This is emotional terrorism
This dude is not ok in the head. This is emotional abuse. He cheats and then presents himself as a sociopathic victim.
WeirdChamp
damn you really outed yourself as a sociopath in this video. how hard is it to just apologize and move on?
great fucking apology
I can't believe he got cheated on, this must have hurted you so much, glad to see you're recovering, cheers!
a cinematic portrayal of emotional manipulation
Why does it feel like Albert look like he got cheated on not the one doing the cheating?
Im so glad you are doing better. this video is amazing, I cried alot :)
what a psychopathic video
Ok I have a lot to say and think about in regards to this video.  I doubt that anyone doesn't know about the situation by now but I'm gonna firmly say that yes, people do make mistakes but yours was a very colossal fuck up. While I still don't forgive you for the situation, even though that those involved do, I'm glad you are seeking help wherever you cna find it and are looking to be a better person from here on out.   Bye Albie.
Video hit deep, im glad to see you back
no just go away
Literal psychopathy
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG ALBERTTTTTT
Great video! Almost makes you forget that he cheated on his girlfriend through google docs.
Good to have you back Albert. I hope success follows close on your heels and despair fall wayside.your fuckups don’t define you your comeback does
the internet sucks dude.. I know you've heard this before but - you didn't hurt any of us and frankly what you did was never and never should've been our business.Keep doing what you've now started again.
only albert would think sleeping 8 hours a day is abnormal lol.  i've known depressed people to sleep 14 hours a day.
Everything I’m saying is visualized on screen
Damn
forsenCD MY MAN
"Hey Albert could you not cheat on Lily?" You could say no to that tho.
You are forgiven my good sir! Time to start a new... I'll be following your journey to prove your grandmother right! Post notifications on! Hahaha.. you have our support!
lmao
Honestly I'm convinced you can do better, I never truly hated you but I did disliked what you did but I believe in you to change and come back better
that street name at 7:12 ...
For the fans that give hate just stop, leave him alone let the man breath. He trying to get through this
We're all human and we make mistakes. You owned up to your mistakes and you knew you did wrong and now your trying to be a better person. Thank you I wish you all the best and hope in the future you become a you.
Good filmmaker, terrible person.
Cringe
PICK A CARD  ANY CARD THE 2 OF WIVES?  EXCELLENT CHOICE
Anyone know the song a the end ?
Damn...this camera work.
Welcome back, I can’t wait to follow and support you on your journey :) I have so much respect for you because of the way you decided to handle everything and even how you expressed your situation to us. Thank you
Still a self-indulgent prick. Cool.
I hope you can forgive yourself completely. I'm here for you!
Great video, I cried. Lived a similar experience. Welcome back dude.
so cringe
On another note, HOLY SHIT THAT CINEMATOGRAPHY. I REALLY LIKE HOW YOU FILM YOUR VIDEOS.
Love you bro..
This video is amazing. Good luck in the future.
Wow this video was good. You can tell the amount of effort and time that was put into it. Honestly good job
Holy shit this is such a well made video, I think we're all ready for you to come back and see if you've truly grown because it really seems you've started!
This was a very well done video, amazing work Albert. I’m glad you’re seeing a therapist because mental illness has been extremely terrible for today’s world as of lately. I hope you do forgive yourself as well as the people that have been hurt in the process forgive you as well. I lost my grandma last year after my 6 month relationship crumbled .. and going to gym was the best answer to it as well as being with family and friends like how you mentioned in your video. Take care of yourself Albert, you still have fans here for you, and can’t wait to see more of the content you decide to give us!
im happy your back albert but at 1:46 is it just me or does anyone else think that he could have scooted his name over just a tad bit
honestly top notch apology/video.
Welcome back!!!
Welcome back! This was an awesome video, youre an awesome person.
I'm so mad about what happened but now I'm so hopeful about what you'll do from now on. Welcome back!
Yikes.. Don't try to play the sympathy card. You're not the victim and you're not selfless. Shameless..
Yo, what's your keyboard setup?
XD
godaym this video was amazing cant wait for that return man hope everyone forgives you and you can move past this.
Damn those filmmaking skills tho
Great video and very insiprational.
As a recent OTV fan, I wasn't there when the drama happened, but this video, I don't know what it is, brought me to tears. 😭
Welcome back, Albert! I'll still stop by and watch when you're back streaming.
Lmao
I wonder what he made with those eggs
Proud.
That incident almost a year ago was shitty but we really can't speak for both parties with exactly what went down behind the scenes.. but this video just shows how youtubers or any influencers in diff platforms really are just people. This isn't some movie where one person is the designated villain and then "The End." Life goes on for them too and they are capable of realizing their mistakes and personal development. We don't have to feel the need to subscribe to him or accept him as our social media influencer now or even at all, but respecting him as a human being is more than enough to move on from the toxic cancel culture.
as much as i and many others are still upset with what happened, i know that those involved have forgiven you and that you clearly are working on bettering yourself. we all make mistakes and what’s important is that we learn from them and that we work on ourselves from there on. this was a beautifully made video and i sincerely hope that you continue on this path of maturing and understanding yourself and your mistakes better.
Everyone makes mistake why can't we give everyone a chance to fix that mistake? Welcome Back Albert <3
Bruh, his erging form is really bad
We're glad you're back Albert ! All ppl make mistakes hope you're good
THE BEST A MAN CAN GET
You can go ahead and leave again :D
This video is so good omg, glad you are back albie
i was so focus on this video i didnt even listen to what his saying. Well made video. Welcome back
All of this because you cheated on some broad?
Banger
No idea what you did; I don't even remember why I subscribed; But this video was transporting !
What happened to that chick tho...I think you fked her life.
Yikes
Welcome back 👋
Learning to forgive yourself is harder than forgiving others
Welcome back I can’t wait to see how you continue to grow
long time no see, in the same mood as you, I hope everything is all right
i dont really comment but damn this was very well put. Also if those involved already forgave him then we should  also move on but everyone is free to have their opinions.
This was amazing, congrats on trying to lead a better life
Welcome back Albert 🤗 You were missed!!
Welcome back, Albert!!! we missed you
1.3k people still hatin
Your video is such a fancy meal to the eyes. Thank you Albert. You are doing great man, keep becoming better.
It's okay, past is past.
Welcome back! I’m proud of you for working hard towards your own goal. Humans will always make mistakes, and although you can’t just fix them, you can change. I will always be rooting for you!
Welcome back Albert.
Welcome back albert we missed you    (>'_') >
Ppl are judged for the worst thing's they've done. Even prisoner's are given a second chance. Hope you get a fair chance, this vid is amazing. Stay stong 💪😬 I was mad at you, but I'm excited to see where you go from here
“Legends never die.” The video that came up right after this video. Welcome back man.
It's a pretty well put together re-cap. The effort you've put in making this video shows that you still have that fire, burning inside you. Hopefully it works out for you.

I think this was a bit dramatic, but then I got to yeast boy, so you've earned my like lol
How is Fed supposed to come back after this video, he's not gonna be able to top this level
Forgiving oneself is such a powerful thing. Thank you for starting on this journey,  not for the fans or other social circles but for yourself! Best of Luck Moving Foward.
Albert it’s been a long time , I haven’t seen you a while!
I believe in you, and the future you will create.
Meh.
Welcome back bro. Good to see you back. You're not scum you're human.
Whatever you think of him, Albert really put a lot into this video.
welcome back!
I was watching this, and trust me I don't cry. But this video, this video got me. I'm just glad you're back Albert!
Welcome back Albert!!!! So happy to see you took the long and healthy road!!! I was so worried for your mental health I’m ao glad you manage to come around and started to be a better version of you for you so you can be there for others ^^  The video wow! Like everyone is saying it’s just amazing 👏✨😊 I was starting to tear up of happines/proud feelings and then the lilies came into to frame I started crying :,)  So beautiful so well done the video and you growth as a person 🙏✨  Stay strong, stay safe be happy 😊💖
Welcome back !
This is really well made
This was beautiful, moving, and inspiring
This video is very impressive. Like the whole set up and this Storytelling ist so good. Wow I want to be able to do that too

This is such a good video, glad you finally gave us an update
I still think you're a fool. A damn fool who never realized what he wanted, nor what he had until it was all gone and impossible to get back. But I believe in second chances. You've hurt people, but you're not a psychopath. I won't say anything arrogant and condescending like "prove to us that you've changed", but I just want you to know that I think you CAN become the person you wanted to become and that you won't lose your way again. Not many people get past their failures and their mistakes, but those that do can grow into the greatest people.
Albert you’re a great person and I hope that in the future you can control yourself and don’t doubt yourself pls cause it hurts you and me
Welcome back Albert 🙏♥️ missed you for so long.
Love you Albert so happy your back  This video is great by the way
That's the quality I've been missing these last few months. Good shit, Albert.
Ur mistake was bad but this is very respectable so pls be better and not make same mistake as last time
I really enjoyed this video ❤️
Im so happy your back !!!
I felt it pretty hard when your grandma passed away, it's the same thing with mine who also passed away this year. I can only hope that they will find a better life in the next one and be proud she left a legacy behind for us to remember. Welcome back, Albert
Everyone makes mistakes, that's why we're human. Anyways welcome back, we missed you.
Looking forward to your content!
This is the sort of apology that really shows the development of the individual. Not that shitty, "I'm sorry, what I did was wro...zzZ". Happy to see you back Albert :)
Wow.
Yes, you really, really fucked up. But, I hope you can change yourself to be the person who you want to become. Good luck, and stay safe -- some of us might just stick around to see it happen. :)
im glad you're back :)
Welcome back! 🔥
Welcome back.
what color is that desk  tho at 4:04
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND forsenCD welcome to the champions club
I missed you. Its been a long year. many things will be different now, but that's life. May you find happiness and success in your works. I hope people don't spam you asking you to make more videos. Good luck Albert. May you have long life, we'll be here for you.
Iam still here albert iam still fan bro just keep it up
Those who can’t forgive others are hypocrites because at some point those people also needed forgiveness in their lives. I will admit I was a hater at first but time heals all wounds. it’s how you prove it to yourself, not to others will determine your goal to move on and be accepted back into society. All the power to you man.
Great cinematography here! Welcome back!
Please don't get into a monogamic relationship if you want to have sex with multiple partners.

Stepping out of the champions club we been waiting
You coming back to streaming? I really miss the late night magic streams :D Hope you are doing well, and found yourself finally again.
2020 is the strongest timeline
This was such a mature and professional way to come back , I didn’t like you before but this changed my mind , welcome back
Welcome Back Albert, hopefull to see what you will do now.
this is a really great video, it brought me to tears. As a viewer and as a person i have no right to judge or forgive you, i can only wish you happiness and success for the future. Keep it up.
wow damn im fucking crying wtf
welcome back Albert. we believe in you!
0:51 that's a "Lily" flower
Putting aside the past and issues and everything. This is a masterpiece.
"and many of the people closest to me" *shows picture of a lily flower me: lily :((
I’ve never seen anything or even known of you. But the amount of work and honesty put into this deserves a sub. Cancel culture is the stupidest creation amongst the internet. Keep your chin up dude.
Stay :(
Vv good vid, inspiring.
again, albert fucked up. i know we were all mad because he messed up and he hurt people, but let's take a moment to think about ourselves. he doesn't owe us an explanation for the simple fact that it was a very personal matter that we shouldn't be involved in. i agree, even i was upset, but i wasn't a part of that matter so i just learned to move on and forget about it. let's all be glad albert is back on his feet and he is willing to accept and move on from his mistakes, and hopefully is able to forgive himself one day. from now on, we should be willing to support him even if he is still clouded by hate.
Its ok, If you need me you can Google Doc me :) lol
Is he on good terms with the rest of offline tv?
i love you
Glad to see you come back. This film/video is amazing, looking forward to the projects you have coming out
10:51 Ok where TF is this??
WHO OMEGALUL
Yo. I just watched this on Mizkif stream and I was boiling with rage, the chat was absolutely idiotic and disrespecful, i seriously wanted to block em all if I could. Anyways, I hadnt heard about you before this, thus I dont know what happened to get you cancelled but this video really got to me and wanted to come and tell you that what youre doing is great, I hope you can come back strong and keep on working on yourself, Much love man.
Yo waddup Albie, welcome back
Love you man, the only way to learn is to fail. Unfortunately your fail made people very mad. I think cheating is bad but who doesn't, I don't think it was something to get cancelled or threatened over. I will always know you're a good man, you didn't intend this but your willing to face the repercussions for something I don't think should be that terrible. Stay strong brother
Cheating is a choice, it is NEVER a mistake. But, in this case, it looks like you've accepted that sharp end of the stick of that choice and made sure you learned from it, and because of that I don't think anyone can keep their forgivness away from you, but who am I to say, you didn't really do anything to US personally, it's just to the people closest to you, and because everyone knows that Lily already forgave you, then yeah, it's best to move on. Welcome back Albert, sorry about your grandmother, and i wish you luck from this day forward and we hope you never make the same bad choice/s again.
good video felt like a movie
Thank you for sharing this. It’s very insightful. I understand all too well. I hope to continue watching your future projects.
Owww shitttt omgggg he posted
twitch chat in unban forms
i love you
tbh. it is great your back let me be the first but not last Welcome back Albert .
you cheated, you didn't kill someone jesus christ start making videos again and if people hate on you for doing so stay off social media and only post to promote your content
absolutely loved this video keep doing you keep doing what you want what makes you happy
I have no idea who you are so I guess you were successfully canceled.
Bro... you weren't "cancelled", you were held accountable.... lol
Amazing video! Glad you are back!
I used to be a fan.             and still  and always be :)
Didn't ask
You made some mistakes, but everyone should forgive.
man went to the gym for a rematch with michael
It's so fucking funny how there is so many people that is willing to defend a legit trash person, fucking hilarious.
0:52 Lily.
I think it was a good move to leave the house and everyone part of it 😂
As a creative this is painfully relatable. Didn’t think he could ever make a comeback but this is pretty good
Yeah I don’t know who you are or what you did but I’m glad you’re back😎👍
I want to see your journey continue
honestly this video is pretty inspiring, the music, the scenery, the narration and cinematography is all very motivating. Im glad to see albert back, looking forward to new content!!!
Thank you
This was a really inspiring video. Very glad to see the growth you have made and am so excited to see everything you resolve to achieve in the future!
bojack playing in the background. i felt that oof
I know this is an apology video and all, but honestly, I think it's just what I needed to hear to get my own shit together so thank you!
kaneki
Dude ! Awesome video. Im the same  !!! We learn from mistakes !
Let’s be real this incredibly well put together, everything had meaning behind it and was honest. We are all excited to see how you grow and overcome a new you Albert.
Don't come back lmao
8:12 so happy so see him smile again
POGGGGG
This man spent a year studying how to make a successful video but it still feels so.....cold, so from concentrate.....scripted like Dexter trying his darnest to convince me he's not a murderer. But really I dont give a fuck, I loved the streams of you, Greek, and Lily making music. That shit with the beatboxing with Greek and that freestyle music around it was so fuckin insane, literally one of the best Twitch moments and I've been on Twitch since 2012.
this is an incredible video. I don’t believe mistakes define a person, and I agree when you say it’s what you do after you’ve made a mistake that matters. welcome back Albert 👏🏻
Hi Albert, wow I did not know what's been going on but I am glad that you are doing okay...I am glad that you are self caring yourself in which the world has forgot to do....Albert, you are one of my favorite youtubers and just seeing you play, made me happy...I am sorry that you went rock bottom but rock bottom can really help people stand up in many ways. Also, making mistakes is part of the life package, but I want to tell you that your mistakes does not define you, it what you do after matters. I am happy and proud that you are taking right path of a new change!! I am rooting for you!!
My boi Albie.
I did not know how much I needed this video.
No way he jus pulled a cory
<3
:D
This is a gold standard of apologies: doesn't reopen wounds and spread drama, admits his faults in a indistinctive style, and lastly, adds small comedic skits that help watcher empathize and relate with Sleightlymusical through the use of rhetoric.  YouTubers should honestly learn from this, instead crying with their cats -_-
Been around since your routine of , "Shape of my Heart."  I didn't follow OTV, but I always appreciated your content when it came out. Glad you're taking steps in the right direction by rediscovering your personal joys, friendships, and family. One day, I hope you find it in yourself to forgive yourself.
I LOVE YOU ALBERT!!!!!( no homo) I BELIEVE IN YOU!!!
We can all clearly see you've learnt from your mistakes, many people including me can forgive you
Cancel culture is stupid.. You made a very human mistake and shouldnt have to redeem urself like this. I never cared for OTV but just thought you were a creative musician and magician.
9:05 shupport 😭
Stop hating worry about your own life
"ill be' = "allbie" smart
So happy to see you back my guy. Hope you've recovered from the incident and are doing better!
I’m really glad to see you back. I actually only discovered you through your YouTube music as you and Tiffany have really guided me through my violin journey. I didn’t even know you’re a gamer until recently lol, but regardless, we all reach really low points in our life and the important thing is to acknowledge, accept, and move forward with a better mindset..which is what you’ve been doing. We’re glad to hear updates from you and to see you’ve been doing what you can to take care of yourself!
As i looked up to you when it came to music this is so inspiring... i know people make many mistakes but having the courage to make this amazing and thought out apology and coming back when people still resent you is so amazing. I am so glad that you focused on yourself more and took time to think and reconnect with what you truly want to do with your life. We will be here and wait for you to grow into the person you want to be! You got this Albert
I'm happy you've recovered and my condolences for your grandmother
Hey there sleightlymusical/Albert! It's been quite some time since I've watched your streams and videos ever since what happened. I'm happy and glad that you are back now! :) What I want to tell the ones who are reading this and to you, is that whether this will become a good path once again will be completely up to you. Things will happen along the way now that you've come back, but now it's completely up to us to make up for what has happened. I'll be here supporting you! Cheers! Hope you'll keep going! :)
Sidenote. I didn't think of you as being cancelled in the same sense of Chris and Fed. Both of those guys were cancelled rightfully and should remain cancelled. Yours was a matter of a failing personal relationship and an extremely abrupt and public breakup... it wasn't you trying to wriggle into bed with girls while they sleep.
Snake 🐍🐍🐍
Yo. Yeast
It's good that you're taking care of yourself. It's good that you're working on projects.  The truth is, there are 2 options you have here. You can take the Doc approach, where you embrace it, where you know people are going to meme you about it. And just not rise to other peoples taunts. Or you can try and paint over it. That second option doesn't work. So if you want to be in the public eye (at least online with Twitch and Reddit) you have to be prepared to be meme'd about it till the inevitable heat death of the universe.   With that, welcome back.
An Artwork.
I’m so glad you’re back Albert!
_Sadly because of the internet this private matter became public. It isn't our place to "forgive" him, this affair was between Lily and Albert, not you. If Lily has forgiven him then you have a choice whether to continue to support his content. It isn't your place to feel on Lily's behalf._
Simply put. Amazing video
I really love you and lily, your piano and violin covers were amazing. I also really love you as a violinist myself. I'm really happy that you're getting back up and learning from your mistakes. You dont need to apologize to us, perhaps, just to yourself. Wish you all the best!
"when you do what you love, your life becomes your work". I can relate to that 100%. Studying game design made me immensely depressed and I wasn't able to enjoy video games (my main hobby) for about a year after quitting. I'm so glad I chose to go down another path and keep my hobby a hobby.
That fake hand is fucking scary bro
Welcome back to the champions club brooo
Albert, let me just say I find this video very powerful. I feel as though many people watching who are also dealing with their own issues can take this as an example, that screwing up and being depressed doesn't always have to end down a bad path. Fuck cancel culture, and fuck the internet. Those who want you cancelled don't truly care about you anyways, so screw them. There is always good in people like you said, and it sounds as though you've picked yourself back up and are taking great strides forward to improve yourself and ultimately you're the only that can know that. We'll be here waiting for some more content if you decide to keep making more. Take care brother
Well I feel the same way but I never give up I continue to walk the same path I took. It's really hard retri ng rejected by everyone it makes you feel super  suicidal but I know that I don't have the courage to do it. And continue the worthless life we have.
Good seeing you back Albert, nice video can see how you self-reflected during this time, stay strong, keep up with your progress
7:41
Everyone isn't perfect. There are far more worse people that don't even feel regret or guilt for what they did and have done worse. He already did everything he possibility could and now we should forgive him. That was an amazing video!
7:39 An easter egg
The filmmaking in this was so spectacular, that I almost started to want him to get his life back on track
It's oke Albert, we all make mistakes  We just can try and become better people afterwards as well as make amends.  You feel guilty which is a huge sign of you being a genuinely good person and this means that you actually won't make the same mistake
Everyone: "We forgive you, Albert" I: "I have no idea who you are"
destiny on the keys tho 😪
really good video
I support this 100%. You show strong stoic values of steady self improvement and remembrance of death. Both parties are achieving a fresh start through honest measures, and I honestly can't see how anyone can go against that.
I hope you find some happiness.
Let’s see how Pokimane reacts to this 😂
Your story has really made me reflect on the personal growth I want to have and seeing you start the journey towards change is really motivating. Though our circumstances that may have led to a desire of change may be different, it’s cool to see that at the end of the day fame, fortune, etc doesn’t take away the fact that we are all still human. Thank you for sharing and welcome back 😁
Video was well made. That's all I'm here for
Welcome back. Just be yourself and be happy for the rest of your life.
Hey Albert. You're going to be alright, missed your content. You were pretty cool! I know we all make mistakes. <3 It's okay. My ex cheated on me, but we still became friends after, he's just a human and I forgave him. We're all humans. We all make mistakes. Keep pushing forward.
Did anyone else notice the road he’s running across at 7:40 is called liberty hill 😬
Glad to see you back, Albert. Looking forward to see your content.
That grandma part got me
he back
I don't think screwing up and cheating is a good reason to be cancelled and I don't think he really cares as much about doing it as implied. I think the real sadness comes from the loss of career.
imma make this message short and brief, I don't care XD
I subscribed to this channel just to see how he would address his return. Curiosity satisfied, I can finally unsubscribe now.
Wow this is a work of art 👏
You do what you gotta do man.
Really beautiful!
Welcome back! It's been a while.
you're way too hard on yourself.
i hate cancel culture, everybody gets cheated on. yes its terrible, but does it mean you have to live under a rock for the rest of your life? absolutely not.
Welcome back Albert.
8:19 straight bars
IF MIZKIF SEES THIS KANSAS EleGiggle
"i dont know if the people i hurt will ever forgive me"  That fucking hit hard bro
Some will laugh from it, some will create memes from it, one side of people will still blame Albert for what he did, other side will most likely forget and forgive but what matters the most is that Lily already forgave Albert and moved on from it with a fresh start and new people, I wish Albert the same.
Congrats on joining the champions club
Good for u👍 hope u come back better
I'm glad to know he's okay. Hope that things go well, Albert!
Let's fucking go Albert. You can do It.
Wow
bro i wanna. cry. vrooo
I am glad that you're strong enough to keep moving forward.
you were and will still be my favorite streamer and I just wanted to send my love and support your way with this video coming out.
You know, part of me will never, ever forgive you.... But part of me also knows that you can't change the past. You came back to.... Restart? But you can't. You are what you are, and that won't ever change... But I do hope that you continue bettering that future, for yourself. One year was enough time for me to see those you hurt grow, and flourish, but not enough for me to ever see you the same as I used to.. Love you, Albie, I hope you find peace, and find love in what you do, from now on.
its good to see you back albert!
Anyone notice when he said "the people closest to me" there was a flower, I believe they were Lilys.
THE TWO TIME IS BABY HES BACK LETS GO THE TWO TIME CHAMPION THE TWO TIME MAGICIAN IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE MAGICIAN AND HES ARRIVED
Wow, this is amazing. We are all not perfect, each one of us have different experiences and different faults, his was just recorded, he already learned from his mistakes...
Wow, quality od this video is amazing.  Yeah, you fucked up and it's good to see that you know it and you work to forgive yourself bcs this is hardest. Someone can forgive you or not and you will be able to live with it, you can run away from it but you can't run away from yourself. Good luck bro.
Thanks for coming back Albert.
this is actually a fantastic video
tbh i still dont know what happened.. i enjoy the music on this channel thats why i subed
Now this... this is a return video, welcome back albert
Them pull ups are not real ones, he's not working hard enough
imagine if he makes a colab with fed online tv
dope vid. Wish you the best
Good video.. Very good video
Fuck yeah albert is back; also I love that fed liked his Instagram post; offline tv outcasts rise up
That was unbelievably powerful for me
To call what happened a mistake is likely a poor choice of words. But similarly, to act as if a single event defines an entire lifetime is a poor choice of concept. People can change, and while past choices cannot be changed, a person's future choices can be made accordingly.   You've got an entire lifetime ahead of you- dedicate it to proving to not just the world, but yourself, that you can be a good person. This video proves that you have accumulated incredible talent in cinematography and music, and it would be a shame to let that talent go to waste. Move onwards towards greater things, but always remember these actions as representative of the consequences of terrible deeds. Always remember how you felt, how those you hurt felt, and how those who loved you felt. This doesn't have to be an end; it can be a beginning.
Extrovert, really? This man got the personality of a rock LOL
i can see you changed
OH MY GOD
albert i’m so proud of you, i never thought i’d say that.
Trying to make yourself the victim Weirdchamp
King Shit 🤠
Glad to see you’ve changed for the better.
Welcome back dude, i kinda missed you glad to know youre doing better now
I really love your video. It shows what YOU want, and not what the viewers might want to see. Sometimes it takes to fall deep down to finally open our eyes. We all make mistakes, it is not about making a mistake but how you react to your mistake. Wishing the best for you in the future. I will keep supporting you! :)
I missed you ;-;
yeah yeah drama but yeast boy is the cutest thing ever and i love him
Really, really amazing video. Welcome back.
This video was really inspirational, I know a lot of people are depressed or sad because they are stuck inside or they don't know how to cope with things. You just sharing your story and what you've been going through and what has helped you could be super beneficial for someone who is in a low right now, I know it helped me. This video was extremely well made and we are glad to have you back. I know a lot of you are binging youtube/twitch as of recent months(me too), but you can be active while you watch, doing little things like a few pushups or jumping jacks can overall improve your mood for the day. Just try to remember you are not alone, we are complex humans with emotions that we may not understand use your support systems, talk to friends, family, therapists, etc. It does get better and its okay not to be okay.  Check in with people you care about, you never know when someone could use somebody to talk too. The national suicide prevention line is 800-273-8255 or 899 they are there 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I love you all, take care of yourself. <3
Welcome back dude and wish you the best on your journey. It's good to hear your story and how things unfolded. Hope to see more content from you, your skills are pretty impressive!
Movie budget andy
Look, I don't hate Albert. I'm perfectly fine with him coming back, but like this? Holy shit dude, this is the most narcissistic shit I've ever seen. The shot of a bunch of lilies was fucking yikes so was using the dead grandma to farm symphathy. There is no reason for that to be in this video. Just turn ur stream on and ask us to pick a card and get back into making some dope ass music. EZ Clap
LETS GOOO HE BACK
Enjoyed how well put this video was put together. He understands what he did was a shit move and did a good thing to be off the internet for a long time. And even lily said to not be giving hate towards him so I don’t understand why y’all holding a grudge over it. If you don’t like what he did then simply just don’t care about it because by you commenting dumb shit is obvious you got nothing better to do
This is really genuine, and I am glad to see you back in the most proper way. Hope you have success, cancel culture is always stupid, but I am glad you are back personally, and doing well
Honestly I'm proud you were able to find a medium such as gym and bread making however I would have appreciated a properly apology not only to the ones you hurt personally  but also your fans who placed their trust on you. Anyways I will still support you and condolences on your Nanay and I look forward to your future self best of luck
This just shows how bad cancel culture is, the dude cheated on his girlfriend so what you know how many people cheat and get cheated on every day? Millions. I don’t think he deserved all the hate from the start and he definitely doesn’t deserve it now.
This videos hit home run but at least your doing well.
PogU
how does a apology video make me cry
I don’t think I’ve ever shed so many tears for someone I don’t know personally before watching this.  Stay Strong. Thanks for sharing, Albert
8:10 I laughed, real hard:’)
He really likes to hear himself quite a lot huh
Ppl are gonna forget what happened and this is just gonna set a dangerous precedent i can only imagine Fed coming back after a video like this smh
HELL YEAH!! He's back!
forsenCD
I missed you from the first day you left until now, and this looks awesome, keep going!
Are you just swearing for impact? Or have you always just swore this much?
I'm so proud that you have been working on yourself and taking it slow thats one of the best things you can do. What I'm really proud of is not "reopening the wound" and just moving forward and telling the world how you have been trying to change to become a better person. Hope you can make it there one day.
I wish you the best on your journey to recovery and happiness Albert
Albert, I wish you the best and I am glad you are ok. The quality of this video was really good! I liked the content, the way it was filmed, and the editing. It probably wasn't easy getting back on your feet but I am glad that you did.  I am looking forward to future content!
Either stop playing the victim card, or stay gone. Please.
Thank you a lot Albert for sharing your thoughts, emotions, and making it to a great piece of art. An amazing message I can heavily relate to. This really motivates to create a better me :) thanks
Get well, and bring us joy with creating stuff only you can make.
♥
Actual good apology video damn.
Resubscribed.
I miss you Albert
WE BOUNCIN BACK BABYYYYYYY
The king is back
I can empathize with this so much and honestly after being one of those people who despised you. but now a year later I can honestly feel you on so much of what's wrong. I'm sorry for jumping on the band waggon and I'm sorry you're feeling the same pains as me
i don't believe this trash for a second. you just run out of money
You keep saying nothing brought you joy anymore. Did you try spending more time in bed with Sarah? Selfish prick.
Selfish cheater makes an entire video about himself. Shocking.
That is cool and all but the real question is why does this feels like hyping about something? I just don't get it. Just say you fucked up and move on. Why make it some sort of a trailer? Like dude you are fine just own up no need to make a movie trailer about it. I feel so weird rn like it feels like the cheating was part of a PR movement for a movie.
Yoooo Elon musk be tweeting him
Only cheated once PogU
Wait so wut happened

your apology/movie trailer can't stop the memes
wait who asked lol
Hmmm better than hypocrite Pokimane apology
Not enough apology too much quality. Its an apology not a movie. Just apologize and move on. Some will forgive and some won't. You canceled yourself. You left twitch. You left twitter. You left youtube. If you actually got canceled you wouldn't and couldn't make this video.
Love you Albert! Supporting you from afar!
Lol
Danm man all the feels i know what that is like and i had to go though the same stuff :(
great video albert. very well made video, and looking forward to the future.
Yo why this make me cry tho.
Xqc
You were never cancelled wtf or we are not on the same planet
I'm glad you're coming back

why is produced like he killed someone lmfao

You cancelled yourself.
Playing the victim btw
Damn, the picture on this videos is amazing.
Besides  everything The video editing is sick af
My Man forsenCD

1:02 This is exactly what I've been thinking about the whole situation; getting canceled is stupid. This dude messed up in his personal life, so all that should've been dealt with there. Something like "that" becoming public and him receiving backlash from hundreds of thousands of people just doesn't sit right with me.
Hey thanks for reminding me to unsubscribe, cheating trash
best "apology" video ever
This video is speaking on behalf of a lot of cancelled people, interesting.
It's okay to mess up once in a while. We all do it. Don't beat yourself up too much for it.  We are all here for you, Albert. And it's great to see you back stronger !
The latter half of this video is an extremely accurate guide on how to get over depression. Rediscover old hobbies, friends, exercise, talk to family.  And despite the public scrutiny, it is okay to forgive yourself when you feel ready to do so. We give forgiveness partly because we know one day we'll need it ourselves.  I don't have any investment in your personal life, but I'm glad you're taking care of yourself. This video is very well done, and, honestly, I might point to it at some point if I wanted a concise reminder of what to do to get myself or someone else out of a slump later.
Welcome back man. Can't wait for the tech-wear content.
Thist makes me to learn more about piano hehe
Everyone deserves a second chance and I cant wait to see what you have in store.
you know i hated you more than anything when the news first dropped but i didnt say anything because its not my buisness. i never thought i would forgive you, but look at me, here i am actually enjoying this well made and 100% hardworked for video. I have never been a fan of yours or cared much for you outside of who your partner was cuz she is a childhood hero for me. But i now do care, i want to see you grow into a better person, constantly not just now and not just better than back then, a new better you every day. cant believe im saying this, but i hope for more video from you to come. Good luck Albert and also, good job
Omg i miss your videos bro
Kyle Landry !!!!!!!!!!!
i know this is a serious video and i trust that you are going to get your life better than how it was before   but now I want to make yeast my pet too
I dont know why people cancel themselves. At least there are some of us that dont care about that stuff and just want to see the content of talented peeps like this guy.
7:13 anyone notice the street sign?
let's go king pick your crown back up
That is some perspective man and thank you for sharing this man, this is something that I am sure helped you heal yourself and honestly listening to the video put into perspective healing for strangers as well who watch this (myself included).  We all make mistakes and while definely everyone has an opinion on the matter, glad you found the one that is most positive for you, how to approach your life.  There will always be something we all have done that we will never be proud of, but if your learnt from it and made yourself a better person thats a positive.  Very glad to see both you and the people involved finally found that support group that allows both to move forward, there will always be those people on the internet that is negative, but as long as you have your friends and loved ones its simply just a stranger voicing something without knowing it completely.  Take it easy Albert!  also great video man (the message and the editing, also the aesthetic ;))
I  truly don't know whether I'll support you going forward... but I have to say, respect. You have to respect a man for doing something like this and putting it out there.
Your work is amazing. Never give up.   To the over obsessed fans... If Lily can forgive... So can you.
Interesting how a flashy video can get people back on your side. Helps to let everyone slowly drop the problem out of their mind first.  I'm more inclined if you just went in front of a camera and say you fucked up bad. I don't care for nice looking pretentious videos. It doesn't need to be that hard to figure out.
damn, welcome back
NGL this is a good video man.

Only this generation still talks about his mistake a year ago and fails to see how amazing this video quality is
The fact that the comments here are way more supportive just show’s how toxic Twitter can be sometimes
Glad to see you back :)
holy shit the production quality in this video is sublime
Everyone has to work on themselves, and everyone makes mistakes.   Cancellation is a part of the growth.   Great on you Albert! I'll always support you mate, work hard so I can google Albert Chang the god tier violinist :)
Hope you find that person you want to be Albert
This was extremely well done.  Welcome back.
I have missed u man
The most cinematic apology video on youtube!
Okay that was a real fuckin banger. Welcome back, cheers to growth and new beginnings
Yes Albert we all make bad mistakes just so you know we all make mistakes your not the only think positive keep going stay strong
I actually got more into magic bcuz I watched you 😁
Welcome back 💜
Truly was a shame with Cancel Culture affecting you because you were one of the people changing Twitch as a whole, especially in IRL.  Shame what happened happened.   Still support you as a fan nonetheless!
The return of Not Albie but Albert can’t wait to see your future projects have a great day and best of luck in 2020 and beyond
i haven't watched the video yet, but im about to. while youre going to get a lot of hate for this, there are going to be so many people along the way to support you. we all mistakes, some worse than others, but what truly matters, is how we recover from them. we believe in you albie :) <4 im gonna do my chemistry test now, wish me luck xD
DUUUUUUUUUDE FINALLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE CONTENT CREATORS IS BACK WITH ONE OF THE MOST TEAR JERKING VIDEOS EVER :(
My boi is back🤘🏾🔥🥺missed ya Albie
i wonder if he is still with that girl he cheated with on lily? not to be hateful just curious
This was an amazing film I think everyone deserve a second chance
...when he was running on liberty hill
Crying in the club rn
Im just happy he's back and this video was filmed really well.
I miss him even tho what he did.
Alberttt!! I missed you so much !!! really great to see you back :)
Good job Albert
This dude's voice changed cuz or the breakup, i mean...
I'm glad to see you're doing better, welcome back.
We all make mistakes Albert we know your a great person keep it up!
Welcome Back Albert, we missed you. Some mistakes take a long time to heal. I hope you will be able to forgive yourself and start making some great content like u always did. Your an natural talent, i wish i was as talented as you. We love you - Your community
lets goooo albert
10:07 what’s the song?
I'm so glad he's back and hopefully for the better.
probably one of the best film making videos i’ve seen
whats the last song?
Look, I don't know if you're going to see this comment, but if you do, we can all change. We're all humans, we still have emotions and we still make mistakes. We can change and people do. You can too. Although you were bad a couple of years back, but hey! Look on the bright side, things may just turn out good again. Who knows. I'm an Asian as well and I know how it feels. I've been in similar times before, but I'm a changed person now.
i love you ALBEEE  ♤    glad your doing good
We all make mistakes and bad decisions. I'm glad to see you back. We all go through things that put us in similar situations. I have felt probably in a similar way that you do and did. Over time learning to forgive yourself will really help. It did help me too. But it takes time and dont let that discourage you  l.   I would really like complement you on your video. It was done so well. Really a piece of art. I couldnt take my eyes away from it the whole time.
Yo nice editing.
I mean Dr disrespect cheated and people welcome him with open arms soo yes a second chance
This is some pretty inspiring shit
Lily already forgived him a long time ago so idk why people on Twitter are still hating when clearly it looks like he changed a lot
I’m gonna be honest this impressed me but I’m not sure I can forgive for on apology video not for you to make another one but it may take time for me and others to forgive we don’t know you as well as your friends or as your family but we are just people on screens typing and giving feedback and most of the time it’s not good people make others feel sad and bad for what they did but I think he end if they made the mistake how would you feel-me
Sorry. And sorry
Hey, just talk infront of the camera and admit to mistakes next time, no hate, no drama, just admit, people will only get angrier .
For me personally welcome back and I hope what happened doesn't become a habit. I was never a fan, before or after what happened, I just didn't think of you at all really so it was easy to go "oh that guy did something shitty fuck that guy" but plenty of people do what you did and keep going. Stay happy and keep going man just learn from your mistakes Edit: super stay away from the obvious peeps tho for sure nothing good can come from going back there
I'm happy that your back and your getting back on your feet
Sooo good wtf?
You've gained a subscriber, that was amazing! and from the heart i hope you'll achieve your goals.
Good times become good memories, but bad times make good lessons. - Uncle Iroh
The comments here are so wholesome... Welcome back Albert. We still love you.
bu bruh
This is beautiful I’m subscribing
This was a very interesting update. When it first happened I thought to myself "why would he do that?" But when they bandwagoned on Fed I realized that everyone at the Offline TV was was basically fake. They were never your real friends. I think you realize now who your true friends are. LA people are pretty fake, so fuck them. Do what you want that makes you happy. That fulfills you in a way that those LA people seek every day of their lives but never achieve it. Rock on Albert. Be Happy and life life to the fullest. I wish you luck in all your future endeavors and hope the best for you. Rock on bro...
Hello Albert. Despite the past events, you're still a really cool person that inspires me to be better. You'll still always be one of the very first streams I tuned into. (One of the highest production quality too!) I mean, look at this quality video you've just released. It's very touching. (Especially for me, someone who feels cancelled as well.) Anyways, I'm glad you're back with us again, and I can't wait to see what's to come in the future.  As a fellow filmmaker, and as someone who fucked up, you inspire me.
Glad your doing well :)
This is a work of art.
3:36 this is so satisfying
a video to finally come in terms that you are a cheater lmao
I was already hooked by the story of what he did for the last year, but it made me really tear up when he started talking about his grandmother.
8:53 its kyle landry!!
Ok i get things should stay in the past but don’t try to make a career again after you admit that it was over
Honestly I did hate you when the whole thing with lily occurred but now that I watch this I hope you go forward with it man good luck Albert 👍
Wow Just wow
I gotta admit, having been on the receiving end of this I don't forgive you and I don't understand it. But I'm glad you're finding a better you. I won't be returning to the fanbase but I hope you do great things.
wow
Great video man, was falling off the grind and this video is putting me back on track
Missed you man <3
Never really understood why Albert got it worse than Fed. Both are shitty for what they did but imo what Fed did was worse than what Albert did
Takes a lot to make something like this. Hope you find it in your heart to forgive yourself. You've got my support.
I feel as if the quality of this video really speaks to a new level of dedication to his craft which is something I wish I could find. Evryone fucks up, but I am a firm believer that anyone can rise up from rock bottom. Best of luck in climbing back.
SOOOOOO...... how's avocadopeeled (Sarah) ? should we look out for her comeback video as well ?
This just made my day and expanded the way I see life
Hi Albert!
Great video
🐍🐍🐍🐍
I like this, this is great
I am not sure of myself, but the piano might be lily
This is actually such a good fucking video
Society undervalues growth and development from horrible mistakes. You challenged it. Welcome back, continue to improve.
Hello  I got to "know" you because of Lily. Because of OfflineTV. I can't like the video. I can't dislike the video. I can just hope you mean each word you said here. I believe you know how much hurt you've caused. I believe you can change. Don't forget to be careful. Words and actions hurt people. But also, do not hurt yourself. If this is an honest video, like I hope it is, then I believe you've suffered enough. You are very talented. And deserve a second chance. Lily was hurt the most and is moving on with her life, and so should you. You also deserve to be happy. Be it alone or with someone you genuinely like.  I like the music you make. I like the magic you do. I hope this is honest and you can eventually be happy with whoever you've become.  Good luck. (:
Man you used google docs to cheat on your girlfriend
Impressed by the high quality.
Holy shit ... that was one of the best contents I've seen on YouTube to date. I thought this guy is just dead forever on the internet but dam ... that was one hell of a comeback video. Loved the point about finding a job that you love and just the overall tone of self-discovery / reflection.
This video is so well done. Thanks for sharing your vulnerable self even though you don’t owe us anything. I feel many people I personally know, including myself, have dealt with depression, sadness and loneliness. Glad you are building toward being a better person.
2 of wives? Excellent choice
<3
great video man 👍
Go filmake you are insane
This is what everyone needs to know about 2020 for the internet. So much awful shade being thrown at so many. The internet needs to see this and be reminded that just because we social distance in real life, doesn't mean we need to virtually outcast those who still try to move forward for themselves despite having made mistakes in the past. Its great to know you're doing better and living for yourself. A lot of us wish you the best in your endeavors to live a long and joyous life.
Respect. Keep moving forward sir. <3
Part 2 will be at fedmyster:( maybe.. he wont have brave to upload..
It’s okay to move on and this is something we all have to realize. It’s okay to make mistakes. We don’t have to forgive. But this isn’t our situation.
When is fed coming back?
Why do people always blame physical and mental health? Just say you fucked up and leave it at that.
I wish you the best on improving yourself and im really not just saying that because i think its nice but because seeing you play the violin made me feel something that made me want to finally pick up my own violin once again after several years and im so happy because that was my very own first step on improving myself so i hope that youre gonna achiebe what you aim for wholeheartedly that is
No Mans Sky made the biggest come back ev-  Sleightlymusical - “Hold my beer”
omg. u know, we all make mistakes. don't worry, there are still people who believe u can be better than your mistakes. i still support you and your content! i constantly watch your vids from time to time.  awesome comeback video tho! hoping to see more soon!
Hi Albert, you don’t know me, and in reality, I don’t know you either.  However, this video is beautiful and you have always, to me, been a very honest, grounded, and good person.. that hasn’t changed.   Your content is always done to perfection, and I feel like I can tell the enormous amout of effort and time you truly invest, even despite financial yields.   Albert. If anything, please go and know that a 23 year old guy from Denmark is incredibly glad to see you back!  Keep your head high, much love <33
High quality.I like it
We all make mistakes. We hurt people. People hurt us. We are young and we have a long life to live. Do what you want to do. Create what you want to create. Yes what you did was wrong, no question about that. But you are more than just your friendships and relationships. Live your life, and learn from your mistakes. I still love what you do and always have. Keep your head up.
this was so good, glad to hear your doing alright
All the best to you man, do your thing!
that was so... good so emotional... dude, keep  trying your best and i´m gonna take that advice about the gym man
In the begging, when it happened i really thought you were a really bad person. But seeing this for the fucking 3rd time today, idk man i want to believe that you are a good person, i loved your streams and i genuinely think you are a  kind, passionate and loving person Albert. So from a stranger from the internet, i wish you all the luck in the world on your journey to become a better man!!!
holy fuck this production is so god damn good
I'm glad to see you again! Stay as long as you want!
Pick a card... Any card... the two of wives? Great option
Dude you didn’t kill someone !! Welcome back and I hope you move on and up . Good luck !!
Albert I'm glad you're back. We all make mistakes and what matters is how we grow and learn from them to do better. it's none of our business to know the entire story. I'm just glad to see that you're working on yourself and doing better! Wish you all the best Albert.
Just dont fucking do it again and we’re good
you got this
"good luck"
holy crap that was amazing
If Lily can forgive him and move pretty quickly, surely he can come back now
Not gonna lie... I cried. Not only because one can prove to the world that a person is willing to change, but also to the fact that... I also feel similar. Not exactly the same... but nearly there. Now im taking this year to do my best to be the best version of me. Thank you for inspiring me to keep the hopes up that I can. Welcome back Albert
People don't know how much it hurts to be the one who fucked up... Great video and all the best!
Dude runs out of money so makes a pity video to relaunch his streaming career to farm free money of retard donators. You aren't special everyone goes through this shit.
Welcome Back men great to see you!!!!
Welcome back :)
Wow, this was the greatest video I have seen in a long time. I don't know what happened but you deserve peace and happiness! Wish you all the best, you're an incredible filmmaker
All this drama aside, the quality of this video has made me awed the entire time watching :D
good luck man
no words can explain how I feel about this video. wishing you the best
Why I suddenly wake up at midnight and open youtube?
The two time has returned hehe
It’s really good to see you back, and working on yourself. Honestly I think this is someone everyone should watch, because everyone should know that everyone deserves a chance to learn and grow from their mistakes. Cancel culture is way too impulsive imo
I'm so glad you returned man, I used to watch you all the time
I am really glad you are here with us again
Glad I watched this video, my view of u has changed.
Alright, not gonna lie, I was a bit hesitant but honestly, hooonestly, good job Albert. Be the best you that you can be and just keep getting better. You're doing an awesome job.
Glad you're back homie
forsenCD
Welcome back Albert. I hope the year off has been redeeming for you
It good to you see back :)
cringe.
Glad to hear that you are well and taking care Albert. We are all individuals in a world where we find who we are and what feel we must do with no certain direction. Climbing a mountain we sometimes take wrong steps and fall, but we work to improve ourselves and prevent such instances through our experiences. Like broken bones that heal stronger than before.
Glad you're back and congratz on such an inspirational video, it's all about improving each and every day not to make the same mistakes <3
glad your back albert 💪🏼💪🏼 proud of you
ok I don't mean to be mean or anything but...  7:12   THE STREET NAME BRO THE STREET NAME
welcome
Ngl back then i hated your guts. But things should move on. Everybody fucks up and everybody needs a chance to pick themselves up. People change with every mistakes and dissapointments they face. You're no different from all of us and it took me a quick look in the mirror for that hate to dissipate. So, welcome back. Safe to say. That video made 2020 slightly better.
<3
Welcome back Albert. Though right now no one else’s opinion matters but your own, you’re doing good. You’re working on yourself and we’re proud of you for that. I hope you’re safe, and having fun. I hope your coffee tastes just right, I hope you wake up well rested, and I hope that you’re happier. Even by a little bit. Everyone deserves second chances, and you’ve recognized your mistakes and you’re willing to learn from them. A strangers approval is worth nothing compared to your own, but I just wanted to say.  Edit: the video is amazing 💕
Welcome back
Nice.
Dr. K stream?
WELCOME BACK <3 🥺
Hey, I know you probably are not coming back to any sort of livestream right now, I and so many more will welcome you back when you do.
✨Pick a card any card✨ Card of two wives, great choice
the reason you don't feel happiness is because you don't deserve because of the hurt you've done to other people that used to trust you
Albert, we all have missed u so much. Were so glad that we got an update on how you are doing. You were always an inspiration to me. You got me into a lot of hobbies like Gundam. I hope you fully get better. We all learn from our mistakes. Remember That.
we missed you all so so much I hope you will stream soon again
Thomas has never seen such bullshit before
You're an inspiration! Thanks for all the great content you put out while remaining such a humble and reflected individual!
Good to see you back
Welcome back bro
this vid was so surreal I love it!!!!   p.s welcome back Albert!
Welcome back Albert. It is very clear to me and to all of us that you're truly trying to fix what happened. Hope you're having a good day
No way. You have the audacity to come back. Lmaooo
I hope people dont get convinced by this bullshit
Honestly an inspiring video. Hope people, more importantly you will be able to forgive yourself in the future.
I believe in you, Albert.
Damn i can relate with this video, not in the sense that i fucked up majorly, but in the sense of self improvement. also the production quality is spot on, gonna love to see what you got planned for the future
People online crucify cheaters waaaaay too fucking hard. Being cheated on sucks and cheating is obviously scummy, but the vitriol towards content creators who make that mistake is nuts. Hope Albert lands on his feet, seems like he's doing well.
Welcome back! It must have been really hard for you to take this step but I’m glad you’re making content again
bruh and the street he was jogging on is called liberty hill:'(
Honestly Albert you're a great guy despite what others have said about you. People constantly make bad mistakes it just they don't have a magnifying glass on them.   Its easy to point at others their faults but others refuse to see their own. Continue being an open person and allowing yourself to develop your experiences. Do not allow others to treat you less and help those that need it. Cheers.
I can't wait to see what you do next!
<3
Welcome back =)
Just finished this video and holy shit I fucking love it and how relatable this is with my life. I know you're going to come back better than ever and it'll take time for self forgiveness. You're not alone Albie!
we're all humans we all make mistakes, your mistake was a big one, but it's nice to actually see someone try to better themselves as a person.
Fuck yes. Welcome. Back.
Alright Swolebert! What’s your current regimen?
Welcome back Albieeee...what a great video..
We are proud.
this is not Albie,  this is Albert
this made me cry so hard, yet it wasn't even for me. This video was for himself, and that's enough for me.
i genuinely fucking cried... welcome back albert
the apology was made sincerely with alot of effort which made it feel genuine.   welcome back.
Don't even remember what happened but  this video is really well but together, great film making great
I'm glad to be able to hear from you again, thanks for being selfish and sharing with us. I hope in the future we can be there to cheer you on in your journey, not as something to drive your success or happiness, but as people who can laugh and learn alongside you. Keep up the hardwork Albert
Holy shit, that was a really well made video! This is so raw and real. The ability to bounce back from anything is hard, but it's good that you have found your ways to do so. Welcome back and waiting to see more. The only thing you can do is be YOU that makes you happy.
I hope you are doing well.
Imagine a Dr. K episode with him
Wow that was insane!!!
Haters puttin dislike, did u never made a "mistake" in your life ? Would u have prefered all people around u to judge u for some crap u did and pointed u a gun to your head ? Don't be so judgy, u'll be a better person that way.
This is how you come back, big W
Amazing production as usual. Its good that changes and efforts are being made , for that congratulations. Personally, I will be watching to see if you really have changed and continue to. Good luck, I look forward to it.
i’m so happy you’re back !!
I’ve been waiting so long for this
I can’t believe how well done this was.  Welcome back! 🥳
0:52 ;-;
mistakes happen, and it's important that we learn from them and grow to be a better you. i hope that you've been well and that this break has helped you grow ! forgiving yourself takes time, but you will surely reach that point someday. i wish you all the best.
Great video Albert can’t wait to see what you make next
I've been following this story for so long, when I saw this that Albert uploaded a video I was like "Oh boy this is gonna be interesting" and then... I feel like crying bro, this video made me feel so many things, it's so real, so human and it's also sooo well made, the video itself is impressive and I even feel like I could be learning about life from this, wow dude, just wow
I'm gonna be honest, this videos is so satisfying to watch, the transitions and everything is so on point
I’m glad you’ve taken such deliberate steps to improve yourself.  I believe in second chances, and wish you all the best. Good luck! I will always support someone with the adicity to stand up for their mistakes!
😬😬😬
Welcome back, Albert!
He’s back! Also this was probably one of the most well produced apologies I’ve seen and that shows that you mean what you said
Everyone deserves a second chance in their life, hoping for a bright future for you ahead
can't wait to see what you have for us in the future, welcome back!
Wow your videos are still really high quality and filmed beautifully
It’s okay if people still don’t like Albert, but for me, this is a great example of what to do when you mess up. Take time and work on yourself. Learn from your mistakes and grow. I’m happy that he actually worked hard and improved himself. The scars from before won’t magically disappear, but I believe that I can say I forgive Albert. Good luck, Albert ❤️ make yourself truly  happy.
I wanted to watch you when you were gone. I'M HAPPY YOU ARE BACK!
For me being uninformed can someone fill me in real quick?
Still a joke lmao
He’s finally back I’ve been waiting a long time one of my biggest inspirations
Welcome back Albert! We don' t have to forgive you as you said...you have
oh shit, LOL...   Honestly, after watching the video, this is really well done. I hope you are doing better now.
Great video, but the choices you make in life catch up to you one day, that day was creating a certain google doc.
what a noob
I enjoyed this too much.
Proud of you Albert for continuing to grow as a human being! Stay strong and grounded and always continue to do what you love!
Well done.
PICK A CARD ANY CARD
i am looking forward to seeing more of your future development :)
what's that keyboard tho?
Growth ... Is a step by step Process ... One Day at a TIME !
Your past actions will leave a sour taste, but I will continue to support you. Good luck.
It’s glad to see you back Albert. Happy to see you’re still here, and you’re doing well. Everyone makes mistakes, but we learn from them, and that’s what helps us improve to become a better person. Again, glad to see you back, and can’t wait to see you more in the future, I support you man.
this is by far the cringiest apology I have ever seen
Welcome back!!!
I’m proud of you Albert!
I honestly was startled by the quality of this video. The effort put in really blows my mind. As some others I had not seen anything about a drama that surrounded you but I'm truely impressed by your comeback video. As someone who edits videos as a hobby I can truthfully say that this video is a work of art. I will continue to follow all of your future videos even if they arent movie level comebacks like this one haha ♥ I take motivation out of this video and it's not just very self-reflecting but it's also very inspiring to others (or atleast myself). I really appreciate you and wish you all the best. Greetings from Germany.
Me and my homies love yeast boy
Flagellation is not the requirement for absolution.  amazingly made video by the way.
The legend has returned
You're an incredible filmmaker. Don't beat yourself up too hard. I'm glad you still have people in your life that are there for you. Friends who aren't there for you when you make mistakes  aren't true friends. You're talented af, I look forward to what you have to do in the future.
Hey i forgive u now give me alot of likes
alright kb nerds, what keyset is that? I need it.
Can't believe he got "cancelled" by some snowflakes    Yes, snowflakes. Ever heard of dr.disrespect ?
well now 2020 took a positive turn
I actually cried T_T
TRULY A POGGERS MOMENT
THIS film making is sooooooooooooooo gooooooooood
We all make mistakes, great video
Damn, the flowers...
Loved the great quality of this video. Glad to hear from you.
Incredible. Wishing you much success and love. Hoping Fed comes back this strong as well 💜
Granted.
I love you bro! And so happy you're back!!!
i really thought my eyes were seeing things when i saw this: it's really good to see you back, Albert. you've been through real rough shit, but it's nice to see you and willing to change after taking some time to yourself and figuring out what and who you wanted to be.
omg I cried so hard, it's great to see you come back ;D
I dont get it, he is such a talented guy. If you like a girl who is not your girlfriend, why you just not breack up with her ? its absolutly better than cheating and then hide the trues. I mean if he do so he still have a good career , maybe just get some flames .
It's great to see u again. I've been waiting for u for so long. Proud of u.
Does anyone know the name of the song that starts at 8:00?
I was just telling my violin teacher how you inspired me and what a shame it was that your talent was going to be hidden.
had to watch it again just to make sure i didnt miss any of the eastereggs. still made me cry on the second watch :D love you man! glad to see you're doing ok
everything aside, this is insane
don't worry, I am with u
i haven’t seen one bad comment i hope he can make a good return to youtube
It looks like you truly reflected on your mistakes. Cheers to you man.
I like your words Magic Man
Welcome back, King.
Thank you.
Impressive
Hi, Albert. Welcome back. I’m not sure that us here on YouTube have the right to say “we forgive you”, since nothing was directed to us or related to us. And although it’s pretty difficult to respect what happened in the past, you’ve definitely changed. You’ve grown. This video alone is proof that something has changed from the Albert before that we’ve seen online. Good luck.
I am at a point in my life where I am starting over again since I lost the person I loved most. This video really inspired me to get on my feet and start working hard. You are definitly right that we have to focus on what we can do now and for our future. dwelling on the past wont get us anywhere. Thanks for the video man you really are an artist.
Very nice. We missed you! Make us some art boi
Welcome back! Happy to have you here again, safe and sound 💙
Welcome back!
Yooo this is a mad video. I felt like I was watching a movie. Can't wait to see more of you and this content Albert. I've missed ya
Thats the high quality content i subscribed for. Clean stuff.
Can someone explain what happened here?
14. “Fetishize my own sadness”  You know what, I felt that Albert
am glad that he is better now <3
in the running scene you can see that hes running on Liberty Hill... might be a little hidden thing
this video is really really really good well done
pick a card, any card... ah, the 2 of wives, brilliant choice.
I know this sounds crazy and all, but I’m hoping someday in the future. That lily and Albert will atleast  make music together. Like the old times. I think that would put it all at ease. I know that seems like some kind of crazy idea , but you never know what the future might hold. I’m looking forward to see how far you’ve come and such. I used to look up too you and I’m hoping that I’ll be able to someday. :)
As much as I dislike what Albert did, this video was beautifully made. If he is genuinely making steps to better himself and do what is best, I will not hold a grudge. I am not the one who was involved in what happened a year ago; it is not my business, it is not my place to hate or forgive. I am glad both parties are doing better and seeking happiness. Good luck with future endeavors! This video was great.
Im legit crying for no reason,im rly happy that u came back and im sorry for everything that happened for u,but u going away changed me in a lot of ways well i still am pretty young and there are lot of things i dont know like what will i do when i fininish with my school will i continue and become an artist no matter good or bad or will i become something else and I never found the answer to that but u helped me finding the starting point in finding it so thank you.
I am crying wright now and I don't know why
All i can say is thank you that you shared your story with us. Every Human makes mistakes but its sad to see that some people have to go trough so much more just because they are "famous" on the internet... no one has the right to judge other people just because they read or hear something on the internet. I hope one day people realise that it´s not ok to send hate messages to anyone no matter what someone did.  Albert you are the best
No one is perfect in this world.   Without a mistake we can't be perfect and we learn from our mistakes to be perfect.
hard to tell with it being the internet and all but he sounds like someone whos genuinely trying. props my guy.
7:11 streets sign said liberty. TT
Why can’t all apology videos be this sincere, genuine, and thoroughly constructed???? Albert I gotta give you props man.
First of the quality of this video is amazing, like really amazing. I just hope all that isn't just talk but that you really found a way to live your life a better way
This video isn't authentic at all, it's so produced. It's hard to tell you've learnt anything or improved your behaviour when there's no genuineness.
I’m an AVID fan of offline tv but I’m honestly glad you’re back..... your work is insane, and I really hoped you’d continue it. Hope you’re doing well man
Hey Albert, wonderful cinematography and great video. I just want to say the majority of people forgave you the moment you made a mistake, so keep doing what you do best regardless of what internet culture conveys. Just know there will always be people who will support you regardless of the mistakes you make.
Yo
Listen here Albert you were always my favorite but you messed up real hard and your growth is amazing I wish you great success if you ever need help don't hesitate to ask for it. Thanks for this video my friend and I have actually been worried about you since you disappeared also amazing skills you got there.
Well all I can say... Good luck!
not the biggest fan but this video was really well done and sparked many emotions. godspeed
ADULTERER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good first video after you came back
Ok but why is he saying violin like that?
I'm so happy for you albert, I've always loved your content, you've always motivated me to become better at things and I hoped you would come back. It's very genuine to take months off, make a nice video and not re-open wounds for our curiosity like you said. Much better than the other apologies I see on YouTube where they just instantly make an apology video and start making content again right away and act like nothing happened. I knew right from the start that people make mistakes usually cause of short sided tunnel vision'd reasons and usually it's not because they "WANT" to hurt their significant other on purpose, so I hope people have learned some things from this and we can all become more self aware and better people.  "It's good to learn from your mistakes. It's better to learn from other people's mistakes." - Warren Buffet
i'm looking forward to seeing the self-improved albert! (btw the video is so beautiful and inspirational- my eyes are a little sweaty)
I'm still here.
You paid the price and seem to have owned up to it. Thats all anyone can ask for
Made me shed a tear, welcome back man.
Came for the drama, stayed for the life lesson.
What a fucking comeback my guy. Welcome back
I was skeptical at first, but having watched the video, I'm glad that you're doing well. What you did was not acceptable by any means but I'm always confident that people can change, and I hold that same confidence in you. Looking forward to what you have in store for the future.  On a side note, I didn't know you were such a talented filmmaker... this video is INSANELY good
welcome back Albert. I think it's safe to say we can forgive you ❤
Welcome back Albert, I’m glad you’re doing well and hope to see more from you just make sure to try your best to continue making your dream of becoming a better person and just know in my eyes just by doing the things you did to try and redeem yourself and telling us, your fans, why you’ve been gone makes you a better person I’ve only been subdpscribed for a day I can tell you care about your passions and about bettering yourself so please continue doing the work you’re doing not just for your fans but for you.
there are no heroes there are no villians there are only humans.
I'm so proud of how far you've come. It destroyed me, when the news first unfolded, and I couldn't bear to think that my role model could, you know, fuck up this bad. I was destroyed, you know? You did some serious shit and I think it's within reason for those you hurt to never forgive you. But I'm so, so proud of how much you've worked towards. I hope I can see you grow into who I know you can be!  - from an Asian kid who liked magic and also sucks at the violin
Just gonna step aside from everything in the comment for a while and say "that was a Pog level editing!"
Welcome back Albert! Hope you find happiness.
Now even though you are back, you still have to block out the noise because it will honestly still be there.
Everyone do make mistakes and people who saw your mistakes either help you gain yourself back or throw you off a cliff, it's a difficult topic to answer others have mix opinions, others have the same opinions or really don't have any opinion at all and just agrees what the majority thinks because they think they might get hate and get cancelled for agreeing to a side they think is right, Everyone is different but through cancel culture people got harassed for their mistakes without even thinking of helping them gain that person back to their former self, if someone makes a mistake everyone will join in the drama and Albert sure did tell us, The internet is thirsty for the tea because they think that your a piece of shit and they are higher than you because of what you did, but in the end we're all the same, we hide things and lie so we can see ourselves as a better person.
Cant forgive him but hateing him is useless
AYYO 🔊 welcome back, glad you’re working on what makes you happy! ❤️
Glad that you F up, Lily couldn't be happier.
Great video glad to have you back albert 😁
I'm glad you're back Albert!
pretty cool video!
Damn you made me cry so bad. Human relations can be really hard, so we should be thankful for all those therapists, saving broken people. I hope you will continue creating good content we all love.
So glad your back Albert rly missed you buddy
Its so nice to hear that your back hope you continue on going over obstacles and focus on yourself more
I didnt expect such a video.. I really liked it. The words/Visuals you choose & how you edited it - Really well done. This Video is very brave of you. Never forget the mistakes you made, but dont let them stop you living your life..  I am sure your family and friends are proud of you and glad that you didnt give up. It is okay to take your time - but once you give up its already over.   Also, i hope you can get YOUR dog one day
I’m proud of you dude....I can’t forgive you for what happened in the past, bc one it wasn’t done to me, and two it’s not my place to. But as one of people that I looked up to in difficult times and seeing you come back with personal growth in mind, it  has givin me strength to move forward as well. Hope your doing well and I honestly can’t wait to see what you plan on doing <3
nice nautilus
Mans brought tha Y E A ST in da house welcome back man
A beautiful return. Welcome back, we're happy to see you again.
Now I’m just waiting on feds comeback        *Kappa*
Ive waited for this comeback so long, glad you’re back albert
Happy to see u find a path that foresees a good future for u
We all make mistakes. It's how we deal with & grow from them that matters the most.  Love you, Albert. Also for the record, you are a great violinist and musician. One of the best I know!!!
its nice to have you back albert, im really glad to see that youve been taking care of yourself. your still one of my greatest role models, and i cant wait to see where life will take you next :)
I look forward too seeing what you do in the future. Good luck with everything Albert.
This video was absolutely amazing. The feeling came right through. Albert you outdid yourself. I hope you come back.
Lily is way happier now get bent
u cheated it aint that big of a deal it happens everyday people just blew it outta proportion, this is why you don't have open relationships on the internet, either way i welcome you back. People should learn to separate creators to see them for what they are and not who they are with. glad to have you back :)
The production value go crazy in this one
Congrats on coming back and moving on. Nobody in these comments can really judge you for anything and obviously you know that it was bad and are working on it, so i really see no point in bringing back hate. Good luck with whatever it is you're trying to achieve🙏🏽
Bro I'm so happy for you, I'm glad you are doing all these things for yourself, and the community that you had is still here and waiting patiently, can't wait to see what's to come, much love man
Whatever it is you've done, this video is just amazing. Technically perfect and so much attention to detail...
More video plz, Albert, I really like your video.
Obviously, his decisions aren't mine to forgive but personally i feel like he genuinely is remorseful of the things he done and that he has grown since then. Looking forward to seeing content again.
Goddamn that's an amazing video
You still have respect
One of the best videos i had ever seen:D Good job Albert
Who tf asked
I can't respect your previous actions. But I strongly believe that people can improve, and if they do those previous actions stop mattering. I also think anyone should be given a chance to improve. I'm glad you are doing better than you were doing for a while and I'll make sure to stick around to watch whatever you put out there as your content has always been good.
Sorry to hear about your grandmother, may she rest in peace.  Just glad to see you back uploading again.
Holy this video production quality is sooo good
Nah you good stay where ur at :)
amazing video.  from someone at rock bottom, thank you for showing us what it looks like to get better. I'm sure your grandmother was a wonderful person, and if she saw this video, she would be very proud.
ngl, i know i'll probably get hate for this, but I MISSED U SOO MUCH ALBERT
forsenCD
This actually made me tear up.. Glad you're doing better! You got this!!!
Im happy youre back even though i was shocked and kinda let down and iguess also stopped supporting you for the mistakes youve made youve always been a huge inspiration to me for the way you were playing the violin and that hasnt changed so im glad youre back
What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. -sasuke uchiha I hope u read this and I miss u Albert
I’m not too educated on the topic but I hope everything turns out well for both sides :)
Welcome back Albert!
forsenCD MY MAN
good for you man, don't let a mistake define you, you're much more than that and i'm sorry about your grandma, wish you the best
Holy Shit. I wasn't even that invested in your story and I hate to say it , but I didn't even think I'd care enough to even watch this video. But damn this was an expertly crafted STORY, not just youtube video announcing his apology and return but an actual story that brought you along with it. This is just pure genius how personal yet professional this video was. This video could get someone to subscribe just for the beautiful film making alone, however the intertwined themes of internal struggle, self worth, and strong bonds made it all the better. I think it's safe to say that this is a man who has finally found his true drive and passion to do what he loves while also bettering himself along the way. ❤️
Fk I really hate you. However I hope you'll manage to redeem yourself.
You did well albert. You were honest, you looked at yourself in the eye and saw more of what you are. Keep being honest, and aim up, you have far to go.
Welcome Back! We'll keep supporting you no matter what!
You should start making short films
This came out of nowhere, and I have to say, it is one of the most genuine and amazing videos I have seen. The amount of work you put into it, it shows the amount of work you put into yourself. You really tried to start again from scratch, to look back, to grow. You can still see shades of the old Albert from a creative standpoint, the transitions, the subtle things, just like the amount of work you used to put into your tricks. I have to say I am happy to see you back, and looking forward to the future. This video was astounding in sending all the right messages.
i’m happy you’re back man. All the best, take your time, because we’ll be waiting. :)
welcome back champ
People make mistakes all the time. No one is perfect but if you notice the mistake and fix it society gives you a second chance. Don't end yourself because you and I are alike.
searches albert chan and finds a hong kong politician. damn k
This is beautifully shot. Very impressive. You've beat yourself up enough. Good to see you back, looking forward to future content.
I wish the best for you Albert. Welcome back :) We will be here to support, I mean we all are human.
Honesty one of the best apology videos ever created. I forgive you for all of your mistakes and i hope you find yourself again!
Ngl I definitely feel “forgive but never forget” but it’s super admirable that he’s trying his best to become a better person
Welcome back Albert, I almost cried when I was watching this. You teached me to become a better man by fixing the mistakes that you made.
you really did fucked up and I hate what you did, but in the end you're still a human who can make mistakes and not a content robot who always seem perfect, but damn this is so high quality and it made me realized how much I miss your contents, welcome back Albert I hope you really did become a better version of yourself than last year
ForsenCD
We were waiting for you buddy! I almost cried seeing that you uploaded and it filled me with joy just to see you pick yourself back up and how motivated you are! We are all here for you! <3
missed you buddy:D
Last year took an L but tonight I bounce back
this is the first “apology” video ive seen that seems genuine
this is what i expected to see you comeback.. damn this video is so beautiful!
"If you live your life chasing the approval of others, you will  always live in the shadows of other expectations."
We all love you
Really well made response with a good message. I'm glad to see you are back Albert!
Wow. This video is beautiful.   Here's to the next chapter of your story Albert 🍻🍻
I still think you're cool but you did mess up big time.
Nice shots
Great to see ya!
Such a great video. Waiting to see more of your work, not your dramas.
This is a wonderful comeback video.  Tbh I think offlinetv as a concept is a bit toxic. I mean right from the starting members have been leaving under non-amicable circumstances. Now, of course I don't know anything about what goes on inside the offlinetv house but it just seems that the members have a hard time separating their professional and personal lives. Living with the people you work with never works out and offlinetv is a prime example of that.
Welcome back sir it's good to seeyou
this was a good video. it let us know that you’re changing, and that you’re not the person you used to be. i hope this last year will be the lowest low you’ll face for the rest of your life. keep pushing forward.
PICK A CARD, THE 2 OF WIVES?
Best of luck Albert ! That was a beautiful video !
Wow. Good to see you back.
Welcome back albert. Im looking forward to your videos again! You inspired me with your violin and magic through the last year and love it WELCOME BACK
people fuck up it is what it is. Just because someone makes a bad decision doesn't mean that they're a bad person, in all honesty, a part of me wants to keep hating this Albert.. but another part of me wants to see him change and be the better person I know he can.
Wonder where this will go :0
This is a really nice video and reflection. I'm glad you are back. Keep making the content that makes you happy. Cheers from Perú :)
Welcome back
I Won't even lie. He snapped on this video even if you hate his guts, you have to respect the cinematography here.
What a great video... Welcome Back.
Forget the past and start on new... Plz we love u
What you did wasn’t even that egregious. Welcome back.
I missed you, welcome back
yo
Welcome Back Albert , I’m rooting for you
I hope people accept you.
this video is crazy
Albert! What you described and in here really has changed my opinion about you. During this year a lot of fucked up shit happened to me and I've done fucked up things to myself but in the end all we can do is better ourselves so that in the future we can help the people around us who have helped us in the past including the people we haven't met just yet. I can't wait to see new videos of yours, also video production was 💯😁 I never knew you could edit so well! Have a great day man!
I just randomly check his channel just to see he uploaded wtf
Wow.  That was a really good video.
this video was well done, i missed you.
big respect to you for trying to better yourself man. i know you fucked up, but you're trying to improve and move past your old self, which isn't something a lot of people can do. good luck in the future, and i hope you do well
We missed you good come back
welcome back man
im so glad you’re back and becoming active and better. im proud. we all make mistakes and not everyone will accept your apologies, but that’s okay! a lot of people are here for you. you admitted your mistakes and that’s already such a big step. those who don’t see that apparently are blinded by rage, which isn’t healthy. mistakes are there to teach us lessons and make us a better person, so im glad you’ve realized, accepted, and learned from that little bump in the road. stay safe and strong! 💕
Yeah what you did was really fucked, but I still believe you got some good in you. I'm glad you're coming back. You made a big positive impact in my life before and I hope you do well in this new adventure.
holy shit this video is good
This video is so high quality that I almost forget this is a music Chanel
Good on you man, I'm happy you've taken a look back at your life and decided to live in a better way. Continue to work hard to be the man you want to be, good luck!
You are clearly deserving of forgiveness. Glad to see you are doing better.
Welcome back Albert we all missed you
Love yours, always. life is progress .. good luck!
Good
Fuck, I'm crying, welcome back Albert, I missed you. This is a wonderful video, truly. I wish that your life's journey will lead to where you want it too. I hope that you manage to make the people you want to make proud proud, but most importantly I hope that you make yourself proud with every step that you are taking to become a better person. ❤️
didn't realize i'm still subscribing to him
Smiley
forsenCD 🤝albertCD
Omg that was so good,welcome back Albert.
I never cared about what happened but i can tell you worked your ass off for this video glad you are back keep up the amazing edits and great content
Shut up cheater
this how you uncancel yourself fr this man goated
Setting aside Albert's past situation and drama and bla bla bla bla, this is a good ass video. Good job
This is a oddly poetic video and I'm loving it
Mistakes are mistakes. As long as you don't repeat and learn from it. Just remember the rule of "Treat others how you would want to be treated" even if they do you wrong. Always know your doing you and do right. You won't falter that way. Takes time to mature and become a real adult. Now that you come to this realization, take that next step towards a new future. Good luck Albert :D
This is an insanely good video. Learn from your mistakes. Glad to see you’ve returned!
The quality in this video is insane. I hope the future is bright for you
not sure if this is intentional but the street sign on 7:41 is called “liberty hill”
Great video, probably the best one I've seen from someone returning after a "cancellation". Hope your personal growth continues and you find a space you can fully enjoy this time around. All the best and keep going!
that's how you comeback in style
The kettle is a 150 dollar pour over kettle. Yes, reflective of the average artist.
Welcome back! glad to see you!
Hi Albie, that's the nickname you had when I heard about you for the first time. It's been a long time gone, and I'm glad you're back and working hard. I always loved your content and I'll be waiting for what's coming next.  Everybody makes mistakes, but as your said, the important thing is what you do after you make one, cause you are not your mistakes. You have to learn from that and become better. You're very talented, and I think most of the people here knows that. So get that ass to work and stop worrying too much. There's a saying in my language which is "No hay mal que dure 100 años ni un cuerpo que lo soporte" Which means something like "there's no ill/pain/bad thing that last over a 100 years or a body that can handle it", wounds are probably healed by now, and if they're not, they will, give it time. Everything will be alright, we support you. ♥
I dont think a yt video has ever been as emotional as this one
idk man
yes yes everyone commented the same thing more or less and most of us all know what that is but i'd like to highlight THE VIDEO QUALITY and THE CREATIVITY and THE EFFORT IT TOOK IN THIS VIDEO. HOLY SHIT GOD TIER SHIT.    it's a super high quality short movie. great to see you back man. better and stronger then ever but what you did before was a little too much so you have to prove yourself on that. best of luck and keep going strong to make up for your shit so that everyone including you yourself can forgive you
"I didnt know how to be happy alone" and bojack in the tv that hits hard
all the best, keep going
Wow... I’m so happy you’re back Albert! I’m glad you’ve taken the time you needed and used it well. Welcome back man, we missed you!
So happy to see you back!!
It's not for me to forgive you, but for what it's worth, everyone deserves a second chance, no exceptions.
Legendary video
You're taking steps in the right direction.
This video is so well fucking made.
Im really glad you're back
The part were you speak on your grandmother hit so close to home. Right now mine just had her cancer surgery and the thought of her dying is nerve racking. I wish you well Albert! Looking foward to what you do in the future!
the day of one's death is better than the day he was born, for it is then that we see the reputation be brought to his name.
I wasn't there when it happened. But human always fucked up, welcome back man!!
Really great stuff, your an amazing filmmaker. Change sometimes comes from the darkest places but you've shown that you can rise above the darkness. Stay true to who you are.
Jesus Christ this is so hyper dramatic
Its Okay. It happens Albert. We are here for you.
Thank you for uploading this in actual 21:9
Welcome back Albert. I missed ya. What you did was unforgivable. But never I've and many people here doubted you were a bad person. The past is the past. Let's all move forward and strive to become a better version of ourself. Also, take care of yourself. :)
Im just a fan so imma stay in my place and say the only thing that counts on my end. Glad to see you again and looking forward to whats next!
Lily should take him back!
You know I'm was and still disappointed with the actions you have shown. But in this video I can actually tell when you work on your self because of the video.  There was so much effort put into this video. I hope that this journey for enlightenment goes well and I would follow you on this journey.
Respect for the introspection, looking forward to what's next!
I'm not here to say if I forgive him or not. I don't have a place in the situation. He's on the correct path of bettering. Continue strong and may you be happy.
We aren't born perfect, but it's the progress we make to achieve it that makes life so much more worth it. Welcome back, Albert.
Coolio, glad ur back!
Welcome back.
pogU glad you're doing ok Albert :)
People make mistakes, it's fine. Now it's up to the people to be more mature about things and move on
Everybody be commenting about the return of Albert, which is great and all, but my god isn’t the video itself amazing, from the cinematography, to the audio
I can't respect what you have done in the past, but I can respect this genuine growth. Having gone through similar self improvement (for a completely different context), I'm happy for you, and I wish you the best on your journey forward.

Welcome back, Albert! We missed you so much  ❤️ ☁️ take all the time you need and we'll be here for you!
it surprises me to even see this video. But i have to admit although im a rather drama finding person and want to know everything that went on in your past which i had after it happened. I'm really happy to see this video and see how you have changed and started finding yourself. I hope you'll keep improving on your way that youre currently making and hope that you will find great things.
I’ve never seen one of your videos till now. You’re an amazing filmmaker
I'm happy to see you're coming back, keep going!😭😔🌻
Gei
I'm glad you're back man!
Glad to see you back, you were the only person I had ever subbed to on twitch. Good luck on the journey that lies ahead of you.
around 7 minutes he was exercising around liberty hill and i'm not sure if that was just a coincidence with how this video was set up
Good luck to you
I really missed you so much, thanks for coming back and welcome back, Albert
welcome back, glad to see you uploading again!
last chance don’t fuck up man
WE WERE WAITING FOR YOU.  There is a huge community here for you. Every person makes mistakes. This is natural. "A person who didn't make a mistake, didn't try anything." Accept your mistakes and believe yourself.
Welcome back. 💜
Regardless of the situation, the video itself is really good. Your storytelling ability is quite incredible and the visuals were on point.
Damn, the production value is fucking phenomenal
Mistakes should never shape your whole life so let’s gooo Albert
Welcome back Albert! Just got a notification you uploaded! Be strong and vigilant. We are humans after all we aren’t perfect human or this world would be shit. Keep moving and keep creating :D
This is sick
Learning from your mistakes means you're growing as a person. Everything else will come in time, or it won't. What matters is that you keep learning.
Haters, the door is on the left. Please don't make any noise as you leave. Much appreciated.
Albert was the only streamer i can watch most of the time. It was so unique and entertaining to watch. Even though what he did was bad I'm still going to support Albert 100% for what he does as a content creator!
This was.... powerful, becoming a better person is the main goal on life, literally everybody do some lame ass shit, and I dont think you could be so fake at the point you make this whole video just to manipulte people. So, well done Albert, I hope you the best. And I  got to mention this, the production of this video, wow!
The production of this video is amazing
It’s definitely been awhile. Sleightlymusical has been one of my favorite content creators despite what happened. It sucks to have that kind of dirty laundry being aired out to thousands of people to judge, but it shouldn’t be a death sentence for your career. I’m extremely hyped to see Albert streaming soon, I’ve been keeping my hopes up too damn long.
Love the cinematography in this video. It has such a distinct style to it. Never seen anything like it before.
Just seeing him upload again puts a smile to my face.
welcome back
I admire you for sharing your flaws and being vulnerable to the internet about this. I'm glad you gained wisdom from your experience. I think you should keep going with that. Healing will take time. Eventually you will forgive yourself and stop thinking about how cancelled you were. You are beginning to truly learn from what you've done, so even more healing will soon come.
Don´t worry Albert, u don´t suck at playing the violin, I actually don´t like playing instruments or music theory but hearing you playing always made me smile cheek to cheek. The real important thing is that you know that what you did was a bad thing and dont ever forget that reaching rock bottom is the only way up                                                                                   Im Brazilian so hopefully you will let my bad english slide ;D  Used to love your content btw S2
I have missed you Albert. I really hope to see you on social media more often but if not I'm sure we all understand. We all make mistakes and those mistakes just help us learn and grow into even better people. You deserve kindness and support. I think some aspects of cancel culture are extremely unhealthy. I don't think you deserve to be canceled because this mistake is one a lot of people make including myself. We are only human. Glad therapy is helping you and im so sorry for your loss. Keep your head up. Sending you only good vibes.
Hooooly shit, this video gave me so much anxiety. I even teared up a little. Good luck, Albert, in this volatile world
respect,we are all waiting for  you,no matter what :)
Welcome back Albee!
Take the time you need and work on the things you love :)
I stan yeast boy
Lol
So any plans streaming ?? LUL am happy that you were able to find a way to cheer yourself up cant wait to see you in the future whether it is youtube or twtich .... take care :)
At least you didn't sexually harass someone
Proud of you Albert
Welcome back man and chase those gains! 💪
welcome back albert. eveyone makes mistakes, but the steps we take after them is what matters. you've shown alot of growth in this video and i wish you the best moving forward. take it easy and i look forward to your future content
That is an awesome work!
Albert, as we all know, humans makes mistakes. And by assuming u're a human, it's only right to say that u were wrong, but it's also right to give forgiveness and give you the strength to keep moving on. I was so disappointed when the news got out, but i am here, aswell as many others who have always supported and instead of just choosing to ignore the things you did, i choose to acknowledge your faults and keep on supporting you to become a better person. Your turn to show us how you have grown in the past year and all i have left to say is good luck my dude.
its been a while ;-;
Honestly, I couldn’t believe that you be the one to do such a thing, I defended you when everyone shooting their shots. When u came out with the official apology, I was really disappointed but what’s more than that was sadness. Sad that you were gonna leave. I really enjoyed your content. I thought you were gonna be gone forever. I’m happy for you, for figuring things out and for fighting your depression. I hope that you will able to achieve your goal of becoming a better person. Ps: dope video <3
I can't imagine how fucked up it must be to get cancelled over something that was personal to both you and your partner. How sad and weird for people to feel entitled to judge something they are not part of. You, and any content creators are yours only, if that makes any sense. The decision of not supporting a content creator because you don't share their views or life choices does not give you entitlement to belittle another human being. (Obviously, I'm not talking about people commiting crimes)   I can't support what you did from a personal point of view, but as I watch this video I feel hope for people to understand that mistakes don't define what and who you can be. In this age where many people seek instant reactions, to understand that we are not perfect and everyone fucks up, whether intentionally or not, is key to grow as human kind. To show kindness to those who are aware of their mistakes and are seeking redemption, not only for themselves but to not hurt anyone else, is a trait I believe we need.  All the luck to you in your journey to becoming what you resolve to be.
Nice to have you back
he probably put more effort into this video then he did with Lily
nice
I thought you were gone due to the drama. I was surprised it took this long to upload since that drama was forgotten after about a week.
Damn i lost my grandma recently too in crying :'( I'm glad you're back, can't wait to see all the projects you've been working on and focusing on yourself!
It’s good to hear your voice again man
That was a beautiful piece, great work!
I'm sorry, my english is bad. but I wanted to send you my support throughout the process that is coming your way. you're human, we all make mistakes. good luck albert.
8:58 a keyboard and the piano harmonica thingy - lily???
Glad you are back man!
Through i know albert never what this to happen but when his grandma past always I feel so bad for him But as albert you said you are reconnected with your old friends I know this is good but as he go on he should walk slowly to it until he reach to LIlyPichu at least and make her happy with joy.You don't have to become lover again you can become friends again and with the other offlineTV member. And what am i saying is good luck on your future and i hope you can become friends with Lilypichu again...
As badly as you did fuck up. As long as you are genuine about changing for the better, it's all good.
So glad to see you returning! This video is absolutely amazing and super insightful.
Lol
Ep 2 pleasee jkjk this is so well made and i miss ya
Glad you're doing well Albert. We all make mistakes and I'm glad you took this time to work on yourself and improve your own mental health.   Btw, the production quality on this video was amazing 💜
Controversy aside, you talked about you liked filmmaking, right? This video was insanely well done. You improved a lot. I truly believe that people can change, that they deserve a second chance if they are up for the challange of becoming a better person. Excited for you return dude, keep up with the good work. :)
i understand what happen but im still here to support you albert
Love you so much
Bro who's cares about the hate, lily was ugly anyways that other girl was way better
I didn’t know who you were before all of this but for some reason I felt like I needed this video. Very inspiring. I hope your return goes well.
Glad your back we all make mistakes and we're just glad you're in a better headspace.
this was one of the best videos i've ever seen, period. can't remember the last time i cried on a youtube video. welcome back, albert.
albert ;w; you got this!
Holy shit the quality, the message, it really made me rethink about myself as person and how I can do so much better you really inspire me to follow my dreams, thank you so much
This is so high quality and so well made. Besides this it is also such a brilliant message and it has honestly touched me to my core ... an absolute masterclass of a video BIG UPS man .. big ups , glad to see u back as well and haven repented and conformed ..
It's kinda funny how many of his fans go like: "Oh, everything is fine dude. Everyone makes mistakes once in a while! That's just human!" Dude took a big effort to cheat on his girlfriend with one of her friends. That's not just "some human mistake" or "slip up", it's a big fuck up you shouldn't just wave away. That's something that will stick for the rest of his live, to him but also his community. BUT if his ex girlfriend could forgive him, there is no need to try to pick up the pitch forks and attack him. Let it be his personal mistake. People are here for the content, not for his private life.
He countered cancel culture
Details: Doesn't show Google Docs. I'm disappointed in you.
Y'all can choose to support him, that's fine. What's not fine is saying what he did was okay. The only person that has the power to do that is the person he hurt. You guys are idolizing someone you don't know, forgiving someone you don't know. Support him, that's okay. Just don't minimize what happened to the people he hurt
It takes a lot to expand my attention span and this video did it. Never knew I could watch something until the last second. Well written prose and top notch visual storytelling 💯 i love this so much haha
Set up looks amazing ^ 2:19
Heeey
I hope everyone believes in you the way I do. I hope you change for the better and to also bring happiness to me from ur content.
This video hit different, the music, the camera and most importantly you, it feels more like i am watching a movie than a short video on you tube. I am glad that you are more or less ok now and I wish you the best for the future. I am happy that you are back  and I am looking forward to whatever you are going to do.
we can only try to get better little by little, day by day, and that's okay.
This video doesn't only help us realize the amount of emotions you have gone through but also the type of stages you have fought through. It makes others want to do the same and I am thankful for that. Love yourself first everything else will fall in place, Time Is Everything. 😌
welcome back :) we've missed you
Man, this made me emotional.
It will be hard for you to come back to state before drama but we belive in you, and we hope you achieve your goal
ngl this looks like its a 13 reasons why episode.
All I can say is rip yeast boy ;-;
I don't think anyone that has been hurt by Albert wants him to suffer. He's being respectful towards the situation and I don't see why a second chance can't be given.
this video was one of the best and inspiring things ive seen all yeasr
:'D
hang in there man we all go through tough times and i wish and hope you best of luck
Welcome Back Albert
Glad to see that you're comming back. I hope you'll be able to forgive yourself. I know that's the hardest part of everything. Everyone deserves a second chance and so do you. I'm sorry about your loss. I'm sure you're trying everything to make your grandma proud of you. I wish you all the Best for you're future
yooooo its the boi
This is so well done. I genuinely wish you the best Albert. Good luck in your future, and I'm looking forward to what you create in the future.
great video, welcome back
This was such an insanely well crafted video. Great job Albert.
出轨不让说？
Im actually so glad hes back
おかえり🤍
The filmmaking though. I hope to come back to this video and say this is the start of something amazing.
welcome back albert
notice how the road he was jogging on was called liberty 😢
LETS GOOOO
Welcome back king 👑
well i didn’t know elon musk messaged you
I'll be watching what content you'll put out next and see if i'll support you Gotta say you fucked up, but also aside from that you were always nice to me and created cool content.  Hopefully you make the best out of this second chance
I'm disappointed with you Albert.   But not gonna lie this video is good. Not a normal good... So good even my disappointment kinda died down and watch what you want to convey to us.   Everyone makes mistakes and like some individual with sunglasses and mustache said "Stupid fucking mistakes man" Take your time to reflect and grind that ass off to proove to people that you're not as bad as they said.  Good luck on your new "journey". You got my wish as someone who once disappointed in you.   P.S : I know bad english. But i hope you know what i meant. lol
Well I wasn't expecting this today
I leap of joy shot out of me when I saw this.
Am i the only one who dosent understand how or why this was so blown out of proportions? I know and undersand infidelity is wrong and can be incredible harmfull towards a partner, but realisticly it has nothing to do with anybody but the SO? It just shouldt change how people look at him as a, content creator, artist, general person, etc. That being said i am glad he took the time and opportunity to take a good look at himself and change for the better! Big up for that
A leap of joy shot out of me when I saw this.
I don't like how you describe your experience as "being cancelled". It trivializes the events almost as if some overly sensitive people on the internet are to blame. Granted, you have met your fair share of overreactions.   I'm glad if you're finding a path towards what makes you happy though. Best of luck.
I’m glad you’ve come back, we all make mistakes and you’ve got our support
I'm not sad, nor am I disappointed. I'm proud that humanity lives on still.   Stay safe Albie.
Get de-cancelled my boy , I hope you changed for good ❤️. I believe in you , don't disappoint us my bro ✨🥺✨
Redemption arc Pog...let's go boys!!!
We all make mistakes..some bigger than others. Hope you're doing well man, we do miss you 💗
What a insanely good video! I watched the whole thing without losing interest once. I was annoyed by you not going to lie but I can see you’re trying to do better so good on you bro! Glad to see you doing better things
This is so well done
Albert!!! ♥️😭 I was just relistening to our love song medley this week, and remembering how you were one of the few people to make me really feel the magic and beauty of music after years of competing and trying to live up to others’ praise and expectations. I’m so moved by your resolve and follow through - thank you for sharing your honest journey with us and making me feel less alone in my strive to amend strained relationships.   Cheering for you always 💓💓
Guys, neither you nor I should be the ones to forgive this man. It's Lily. He cheated on LILY, of all people. Yes, people do make mistakes, but you can't just brush it off like that. It was a huge mistake. A mistake that only Lily can forgive, not us. It's important to realize that he did only come back to make money, well obviously. I'm not going to be supporting this, but if you are, great. Just don't say "It's okay, people make mistakes" because you aren't in the right to say that.
Fedmyster x SleightlyMusical (Albert) cant wait
We love you Albert! We know we aren't perfect, people may treat you unfair but cheer up! You have people who love you!!!
I do think that what you did was bad but i will love to see the redemption arc
Wish ya the best mate
I’m glad that you are getting better. Hope to see you back and happy. Great video as well!
so are you gonna start streaming again or was this just an update video.
I’m glad that you’re changing Albert, into a better person
Good luck man
Glad you came back Albert! After a year, I'm glad you found the answers and got  help from professionals and family members.  I hope to see the new you from now on.
Lets goo finally an upload
Man makes love to bread
Even though I still can't believe what he did, i got disappointed cause he's the perfect guy until that problem came. Its fking 2:30am rn and I'm crying because of Albert. I hate u for being too good, do well and stay safe mate.
Now all we need is a comeback video from Fed...and im gonna be sooo god damn happy!!!!!
I thought you would never post again but seeing this made my day, week and probably much more
pogchamp
I didn't knew that the cancellation duration is 1 year, soon we'll be seeing a video with fed ?
Good luck on your journey. It's good to see that you're working on yourself in order to be happy.
nah shut up
❤️
I didn't know I was gonna cry with this video. Welcome back.
very methodical pity-bait mr. albert, well done
This Is a Masterpiece of a video!!
Miss you and your content hell a lot! When my instagram notification pops up, I immediately stop what I was doing and have to check your video right away. I am happy that I have chosen to follow someone inspirational since the first day. Best of luck and you have my support!
Interesting
not using dark mode on twitch is an L
I think if you see that you did bad and try to be better I think you deserve happiness. So you do 😼🥺
Albert, you have no idea how amazing for me is to hear you again. Also your speech touched my heart and I think in some way made me think a little bit different about myself, mostly about the fact that lately I can't get any happiness from things I do. I'm really really glad I can hear you again and despite the past i was never against you. I'm repeating again but I was so happy seeing a video from you. I'm glad you are trying to look forward and I hope I will be able to do so one day. I'm waiting for your next videos or projects if there will by any but take your time and I wish you the best. Since I know you, you were and you are one of the best person I've ever know and always loved your hobbies, photos, esthetics etc. Also for me you were the best violinist that let me feel the emotions and I could listen to you forever. Stay strong and keep going ❤️
Good you are back! Missed your videos bro!
I’m not gonna lie during it all dude it was hard not to express anger towards you, because I had gone through a similar situation. But tbh it’s really nice to hear your voice and see that you are doing good man. Welcome back to the internet
I MISS YOU ALBERT WISH THE BEST LUCK! LOVE FROM THE PHILIPPINES!
good video
<3
in my opinion u'r a great content Creator. I hope i can be a part of your journey, cause everybody do fuck up sometimes and thats okay, if u can recognize it and do yyour best to fix it.  keep walkin Albert. It'll be a long one
When I say I got chills, you better believe me. Dear Albert, welcome back! I just want to say, you've done good, you've done a great job and you are proving, improving, developing yourself more,and we're truly proud of you. We know you'll keep it up, shit happens but see, as you hit rock bottom, you came back up. You will get back up even higher than before. Please do know that we will be here to support you, so you do you! Take good care and can't wait to see more contents you would love to do, truly love to do. Take your time, we will wait.
Rooting for you,  the comeback is going to be strong
I will be honest when I say that I was one of those who berated your choice and how it harmed others. I believed you to be someone worthy of scorn and negativity for what you had done and it was rightful. I *believed* that, past tense. While I still believe people should remember their mistakes and internalize why what they did was bad the important thing to remember  about s*** from the past is that it makes d*** fine fertilizer for growth later. I also sincerely hope that when I look you up that I will have the privilege to see the person whom I adored as a goal for my own musical pursuits, the bacon for my interest in magic, and my touchstone for honestly sick-looking fashion haha once more. Stay strong, and always improve.
Also you don’t need others to accept you or forgive you ,the only person is you only you not others
Its beautiful seeing such an amazing video! Good luck with your 'start'
we're glad ur back, u got it
Good to see you back ❤️
Good to see u back.
Keep it up man, you can do it
I feel like we don't have the right to "forgive you" because you haven't done anything wrong to us but I can say so myself, I missed you man, it's great to see you are back
Such a beautiful video Albie, glad you're back and can't wait till you make more videos 💯 I'm very happy to know you're good and healthy 🙏 and I, personally,  do forgive you.  Everyone makes mistakes but it doesn't mean everything is over . Albie, just do you and us, the people who support you and care for you,  will be here 💯🙏
Welcome back albie <3
That was nice. Glad you're doing ok
YouTube Award for "Comeback Is Real" goes to Albert. 🤯
Amazing video. I really really hope for you to do well one day. Keep up the great work. You really are an Inspiration for people who did mistakes. I am happy youre back
Welcome back. We all have our fuck ups, but we really REALLY hope you learned your lesson. The amount of hate you received was understandable but i’m glad you bounced back and understand the situation within the past months. Continue taking care of yourself and we look forward to the content again Albert.
Hi lol ur back
This video inspired me so much into building my ideology. As someone who constantly feels like shit, i can tell how hard it is to live, so, thank you.
forsenCD PICK A CARD ✨ forsenCD ANY CARD ✨ forsenCD THE 2 OF WIVES? ✨ forsenCD EXCELLENT CHOICE ✨  anyway glad you are back
Been waiting. Exited
i missed your content and im glad to see that ur back. im happy that u took time off to self evaluate and grow. im really excited to see what youve been working on!!
Been waiting so long, glad to see you back!
I'm sorry for you loss.
<3
What a great video showing so much self-growth. Hang in there. :) You're doing great, Albert.
Albert  I'm glad you've taken this time to reflect upon yourself as a person, and pick up some new tasks for yourself. I always waited for a return from you, and I'm glad that you have an amazing future ahead of you. Keep fighting towards that goal. ✊🏼
I love comebacks :D
It´s great to see you agian Albert! I hope you are alright keep it going!
I feel bad for him and regret the shit i gave him
We should learn to separate personal life choices from (content).
I'm proud of you man Best of lucks on your new projects, this one was insanely good and it reflects how much you've been working on yourself to become a better version of you.
this is a great video albert, everyone makes mistakes, it's how you learn from it and act from it that matters. Good luck and carry on going.
should've just turned the camera on and started talking spontaneously. This high quality production bullshit sounds disingenuous
I missed you, still love you, no matter what
YES HES BACK!
I feel you a lot I also wanted people to see me and I never said no because I wanted to make them happy but was it?I was stuck always of myself making a whole depression I had but I never gave up on myself.I learned how to not give other their pleasure and I learned on myself.And finally I feel much more better on myself and accept my self and now I am more confident
woah
Who knew all you gotta do to learn how to become one of those new-age hipster edited videos is to cheat and lie about "I dont like being touched"
Lily already forgave Albert, the one who was hurt the most. Why can’t we do the same? We don’t know the complete story or got any closure like with usual YouTube drama. But, people deserve second chances especially when both parties have moved on.
Everyone messes up, but not everyone messes up in the spotlight. Maybe the people who cast judgment are just those that have yet to need forgiveness themselves.
wow an actual apology video, not one of those "i sit in front of a webcam with a hoodie and messy hair" ones everybody does.
Welcome back <3
Glad to know about your return! These past months were very difficult for you, and I'm glad that you are moving on from that. You've noticed the mistakes and emotions that were tainted in the past, and plan on fixing, and moving on from them. That proves that you are growing as a person, for the better. There will be hardships in the future, because there will always be people that remember. You can get through them as you grow, and then people will see you as a new Albert.
I FUCKING MISSED YOU MAN
I looked up to you so much since 2017, you made me get into music and sleight of hand. I was heartbroken when you I heard the news but I really wanted you to come back and show the world that you changed. I wish you luck and hope your anime redemption arc off camera helped. Good luck Albert and I can’t wait to watch your content again💜
All the drama stuff aside, that was hella good video. Well made and well done.
Its good to have you back sir, yes shit happens ,we are all humans. Don't dwell in the past, look ahead into the future, upgrade yourself everyday. Learn,love and forgive. You only live once, make it count, good luck sir.
This is the most sincerest apologies I have ever seen in a youtube video
What an amazingly crafted video
It's great to see you back after a year. I'm sure you've had lots of time to reflect and I believe everyone gets a second chance. Although the mistake you made was extremely hurtful, but I'm happy to see you bounce back and take responsibility for your actions by being here. Everyone may be harsh, but at the end of the day, there is no point in dwelling on the past, so it would be amazing for you to prove yourself from scratch as the amazing content creator we once loved supporting.
This feels genuine. I find myself wanting to support you. Now, maybe it is naive of me to trust this, maybe the support and forgiveness for this will cause hurt to the people that were wronged. I hope they can heal too, as long as it may take. "What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature with great effort?" I hope you're putting in that effort. You got this.
I'm proud, even though I don't know you and you don't know me, I am proud!
The mistakes we make in our life are often irreversible,  and the ones you have made are no different. However, if you let yourself drown in self hatred as a result, you are an even worse version of yourself than the one who made the mistakes originally. I'm glad your doing what it takes to move on, and I look forward to seeing the kind of person you are able to become as a result of all of this. It is still going to be a long, hard road, but I believe in you and wish you the best.
PogU missed u albie
What’s weird is that this when video came out I was just done listing to the music on his channel and reminded me to love everything life gives me.
he’s back
happy to see your back man, hope you're doing well  :)
“And this is why I cheated on Lily”
I have no idea what happened, nor do I need to know.  This 11-minute reflection is what so many of us need to hear; it's an example toward which we all must strive.  Evolving, learning as we go, this is life.   But those things only happen with courage.  You are demonstrating courage in ways that will inspire so many of us to live our best lives, too.
I’m so glad to see that you’ve been working yourself up to become a better version that you can be, everyone makes mistake and you are no different, and I know it’s hard to get back what you once had, but you’re stronger now, and that you won’t make the same mistakes again
people really hate this man for not being faithful in his relationship. But at the end of the day you are legitimately more mad than the parties involved. His personal life should not kill his professional life. Plus it’s not like he’s you know sexually assaulted any one.
PICK A CARD forsenCD ✨ ANY CARD forsenCD ✨ THE TWO OF WIVES? forsenCD ✨ EXCELLENT CHOICE forsenCD ✨
Miss you Albert glad you have you back I still watch your music vids and old live streams to inspire me with music and magic I hope you are well
i missed my boy qwq
Im so glad you're doing fine. Missed you
man thank you. you had a lot of us worried for quite a while!
ALBERT! I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK! ^^
I believe in you. Keep moving forward.
im so happy your back albert
The video was rly good. As far as i hate what u ve done to Lily I do think u deserve a second chance. The thing is u can t reset ur life, this will be sth that will be with u till the end of ur life and i feel like that s the biggest punishment there is. I hope u have changed for better and u are becoming a better person every day. I m wishing u the best.
Don’t worry u and fed were the only reason I bet everyone watch them in the first place keep ur head up king their a bounch cringe ass group of friends
Lilly ile aranızda yaşananlar üzücüydü ama kısa sürede toparlanman beni mutlu etti.  Hayat devam ediyor ve içerik üreticiliğine geri dönmen beni sevindirdi,Aramıza tekrar hoş geldin.
7:40 crossing Liberty Hill... deep
it must have been rough for u, that's what ive been wondering this whole time
its good to have you back,welcome home
i just search u btw and hi again Albert
I'm proud of you. We all are. You deserve a second chance and we're more than willing to give it to you.
It's honestly the best video I have ever seen
Glad to see your ok and it takes a lot of will to own up to mistakes you make and improve yourself over it keep pushing!
Hope you get better Albert everyone makes mistakes but you can always come back from them
yoooo albert
Glad you're back man
Very glad you’re back
you did some fucked up shit, but youre still a human, and make mistakes, like everyone else. and i love you for that. Youve been my favourite content creator, pretty much since you stopped, and now i'm happy you finally gave a sign of life. Thank you
i would be very happy if those aren't empty words, it would be healthy for the internet as a whole i think
Welcome back buddy
Life Has a Purpose. :) Stay Strong Albert!
Welcome back
I really didn't know why you weren't active all this time. I missed you 😭😭😭
Finally man good to see ya
Hi Albert, Thank you so much for acknowledging that you were fucked up and that's alright. I really wish you could be a better person and i know you will be a better version than the past. I wish you a good luck and welcome back to the internet <3. Hopefully you could start a new community that will love you and support you allong the way :)
I'm so happy you are back, thank you for this, this video is beautiful
Everybody makes mistakes. You're human if you do. Like you said, its what you do after the mistakes that matters. And to the people saying all the negative things to you about what happened... I can guarantee you they've done worse. Their life just isn't public. Keep it up Albert Chang. Sorry about your Grandmother <3
This was so beautifully shot and well presented! I think we all know what it's like to fuck up anything and I'm glad you were able to move forward and work to be better, it's a part of our unique lives - I'm excited to see what's next
Welcome back, Albert. It's been a while indeed. Very impactful video.
oh shieeeet.
I think that everyone can agree that you fucked up, but this was one hell of a way to come back. I'll support your endeavors as you strive to become a better version of yourself. I am happy to see you come back even if it's for just this video alone. Mistakes always happen and you deserve a second chance. I hope everything goes well for you man.
welcome back man! :)
Welcome back!  Those who support you are here for you!  We are here for you!
your my hero!! same interests and hobbies!!!
We are proud bois and gals
Simply great film.  Looking forward to seeing more awesome stuff from you. Everything is changing and the only thing I hope not to change is your creativity and you happily uploading on this channel ;) Missed your awesome work a lot, Albert!
What projects are you working on now?
this video is amazing not only in the words that he said, but also the way it was filmed
I won't say the internet condone of what you did, but that judgment is not for the internet to make. But what we can say is this was a sick ass video.
nice video
❤️ Speechless, that is a good way to come back, finding yourself
Good luck
It's nice to see how you're doing, I hope you're staying safe! When are you gonna teach us how to make yeast? :)
this video was simply amazing
I can feel when someone is lying and when someone is saying something they really mean and i just want to say that this is one of  the most deep and sincere things i have heard in my life. I believe that you deserve a second chance ....and if lily sees this i am sure she will think it trough
I'm overwhelmed by how supportive this comment section is. We're proud of the progress you've made.
Welcome back Albert
You fucked up, and you relised that, I respect that, wish you the best, stay strong albert
Amazing and touching video. You really seemed to have reflected and grown from your mistakes. All the best moving forward dude <3
I'm glad to see you got help :)
im glad you've been taking care of yourself and happy to see what you'll be doing in the future <3
I feel bad for the people you hurt that's true but your filmography, God its just so fucking good. I felt every emotion, every scene, beat for beat. I don't really know what to say but, good luck and be well
I’d like to see this video as well received as it is put together
champion’s club
really well made video man, gj
welcome back albie! we've all missed you so much! Can't believe how happy this made me. and right before my birthday! (now just do the return stream on wednesday and it'll be the best birthday i've had so far :D )
People cancel him like he just kill someone lol. Why
Damn since Albie joined the champions club doc made sure that he gets a cinema studio crew for his video. Holy fucking shit I don't know when I seen video quality like this from a YouTuber before.
i need to ask this.. did you see the memes?
i know this might sound selfish. but can i get a list of equipment used to film this video? :)
If anything, this video highlights your talents. I believe in second chances and am looking forward to your return. Minor feedback: Be yourself on stream more! I've always noticed that you seem reserved.
Welcome back Albert! Much Love!!!
You make your mistakes your mistake never make ya if you wanna come back come back man you fucked up but it’s clear you understand try I’ll support you hood luck
Thank you for such a beautiful and sincere video, Albert ❤️ I've always loved you. Count on me, OK?
Thanks.
Second chances are underrated. Glad you’re improving, honestly it inspires me to do the same. Ive yet to hit rock bottom but once i do, i hope to look to you as inspiration
Ahh man I cried alot watching this, and not just because I loved watching past content of his and Lilys on repeat (although seeing tiger lilys and knowing he bought those with her in mind to make this apology does break my heart as well), but you don't often get to hear what happens on the guys side of the story of the breakup, whether or not they were in the wrong.  I think this video may still be a form of looking for how people view Albert now, and how he can move forward, but none the less you can tell just how long and hard it must have been to make this. Regardless of your mistakes, I hope this stride towards recovery isn't seen short and you will continue to follow what you think is right. We still love both you and Lily, even if your paths may no longer be connected, stay strong 💟
Yo
for a sec i didn't believe my notification 😭
I was expecting a medicore apology video and I'm glad I didn't and I ended up seeing the struggle of a person I relate to in a very similar level.
i didnt remember having notifs on so when it randomly popped on my desktop i fucking jumped
Heya Albert :)  I'm glad to see you again, it's been way too long.
I'm so glad that he's changing himself. I've always idolized him and  tried my hardest to learn music and magic before the incident. This gives my really does give me hope.
Damn it's been awhile
Respect. For everything this video is and represents.
The topic aside, great video. :)
You're an actual legend, like seriously!
welcome back, we all know mistakes happen, big or small and there really isn't a way to patch it up, we can only learn and grow.
I was watching some old/random recommending videos of OfflineTV and I was actually just checking the channel being curious what content you've used to upload to see this video uploaded 5mins ago.  I know the story from what other shared but I believe that you really learned from the mistakes and that you are trying to get better. I really respect that and find it inspiring.  Cheers
Welcome back, Albert.
Hey man. I hope you're doing okay, this whole mess shouldn't be this big as it was, but... what happened, it already happened and I hope to see you'll play viola for us one more time <3 Keep up there
Damnn welcome back dudeeee, I still dont forgive you for what you did but its time to move on c: Dont make the same mistakee💪💪 I will support
danmmmmm so good
I'm touched, whether it is the point of this video. I really respect and appreciate Albert.
❤️
Amazing, and very honest video. Hope u keep working on improving urself <3
Gj albert. I hope u do come back though
It was about time. Welcome back Albert SleightlyMusical :)
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I dont know if you planned to ever come back to streaming. But i can tell you i really really loved your chill streams to relax and play some games and i still follow your magic tutorials i downloaded from twitch ;D Wish you the best.
Alright Albert, gonna give you a second chance. Hope you'll live up to your own words my guy. Here's to another chance. Hope things go well.
finally
Welcome back Albert! I wasn’t a huge fan before, but I’m one for second chances. Go on and show us that people can make meaningful self improvement!
hi
In every way, people have to acknowledge their mistakes and strive to do better, glad to see you again albert
Albiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii i missed you
I miss u bro I've really think u have learnt your lesson
Bro your young, you cheated on a girl. It happens. Welcome back.
This video was so well done 👀 Glad you’re back! ( R.I.P Grandma ) make her proud sir!
Missed u buddy
still here for you,
Beautiful
Hey. It has been a minute. All this shit takes time, and I'm glad you've been working on yourself and using this time constructively.   But we still here. At the end of the day, I subbed to you because of your content. Because of your talent as a musician, and a camera op. And because of that, I'm still here.   You can't change what you did, you can't rewrite history, but the future.... The present.... your actions continuing, that all still matters, and so do you. Everyone affected has experienced pain, but after pain comes healing. Let's work on that, together.
Trying to save face KEKW
Oh my goodness Albert. Am I crying
You are an amazing person and I used to be kinda like this but not on a level as you have. I’m glad you posted and you need to do what you want. I hope someday to meet you. You once commented on a comment I made and that made my day. I screenshot it and flexed it on my friends that you commented to me. You are amazing and you need to do what’s best for you. Work on you and don’t let others use you. If you never post again I will still always remember and watch the amazing videos you made. You are one of the most talented people I’ve ever met. Albert no one should be mad or disappointed in you. No ones perfect or can tell you how to live your life. Spend time with those you want. The viewers don’t matter nearly as much as your social life and your family.  -We missed you  But do what makes you happy :)
Yo we get to see a magic trick again
Good luck
Man, I’ve been here for a while. Ever since “Puffs of smoke”. That really touched me, and watching this video really reminded me of that. I’m glad you’re back and getting better. Just keep improving yourself, it’s amazing how you resolved this on your own and that is something you should definitely be proud of!
Im always gonna be your fan keep your head up
Welcome back albert. Everyone fucked up eventually. It's ok to be fucked up as long as you're coming back up again.
Good luck Albert!
PogU
Honestly I'm glad your ok man
We ALL make mistakes.
meh
That awesome personality was in you the whole time? You're awesome albert, the way you think, I love it. Good luck when life gets dark :(
I'm excited about your comeback I can't wait to see what you'll do because I have always loved your content.
Hey welcome back, we’ve missed you <3
good for you albert, i’m glad you’re doing what makes you happy again and flipping to a new page in life. goodluck with your new journeys and i wish you the happiness you deserve :)
0:53 .... lilies :(
This is why you hear everyside of the story before you talk shit. Albert, we all fuck up, not in the same ways but we do.  I missed you so much! It's great that you are back man UwU
F
Its good that your back man cause we all missed you
Wow, what a touching and well done video, keep your head up man. I forgive you 🙏
Welcome back, Albert. It’s good to see you’re working towards being better. I hope you all the best in working through this.
🥺
It's nice seeing you again, and happier
0:49 WTF THAT VIOLIN NOOOOO BRUH
the editing and everything is really good- <3
Welcome back Albert!
Nice video
Welcome Back!
We missed you Albert. Thanks God you are back
Yooo
Be the best version of yourself Albert, prove us wrong :)
Very inspirational
I’m glad you’re happier now Albert, I’ll always be supporting you no matter what, and I hope that you will keep being happy and keep improving yourself. I’m glad you’re back.
Regardless of what happened you’re super fucking talented and I hope you come back stronger
glad to know you're still well!
0:54 lilies..  Honestly, I was a bit angry and hurt by what you did. I really did like your content and supported you alongside the others but what you did was really shocking. Still, she did say to not give hate and I agree. People deserve 2nd chances. I'm proud of what you did; taking a break and TRULY reflecting on yourself and your actions. And as much as I hated what you did, I still wish you the best as a content creator.
take your time man, thats all i have to say :)
Fedmyster+Albert= the rejects club :(( i hope you're eating well
Wow
Hey Albert, you might not read this, but I’m glad that you’re back (and hopefully doing better). Although I still think negatively of you, but it is not my place to judge you as Lily has already forgiven you. I believe that people deserve second chances, and I hope that you hold onto that chance.  Good luck.
Good to see that you're okay.
welcome back man. missed you dude. and like everyone says, we aren't all perfect. :)
i'm waiting youuuuuuuuu 한국인 모여랏!
We all miss u man just know u can recover it just takes time and we will give you as much as you need
It's so beautiful. It's like a Disney short film. Welcome back Albie I'm glad you've learned so much from this <3
Albert, yeah you fucked up... who doesn't, everyone deserves a second chance and you're genuinely working on improving yourself, most people can't say that. All the best for you man, love ya.
Mistakes can happen  to everyone , but am glad your back Albert
yo this video's lit
Nice
lily watching like 👁 👄 👁
i love to see you back
hopefully u can find something that makes u happy
Pog champ.
I’m still surprised your back if the thing you did it wasn’t a mistake it was a broken hole deeply and it’s choice you should of came back a year after
LULW
im glad your doing ok  welcome back♥︎
I did a double take
woah
Everything that's wrong with cancel culture; bully them to death. Albert is right, eff all that.
I honestly didn't know what you did -- I had to search it up. And I have to say, it's ok. Mistakes happen, and humans can learn from them and evolve. I wouldn't classify what you did as "unforgivable", so... even if it's just a random person on the internet saying this, good job Albert. This video is amazing and it really shows all the self-reflection you did in the past year. I'll keep this short, but feel free to reach out if you ever feel lonely. Kindly, Alfred
HOLY SHITT 0-0
Welcome back
Glad to have you back :)
Everyone makes mistakes, but what matters is how you bounce back and better yourself as a person. It sure seems like you’re on such a path and I wish you luck in your quest for forgiveness and self-improvement.
Can't believe I'd come upon this right after it was posted, really missed your content! I'd stay up late just to watch your streams back when I was in secondary school :D  My most memorable moment was when you were playing a Mario game and was attempting the same part for many times, and I typed in stream chat as a joke that you were gonna fall and have to start all over again, and you actually did have to and replied "NemotheChibi u jinxed it"  Not sure if u remember, but it made high school me really happy that day :D
This video is also hella well edited
Albie, I still support you ❤️
I'm glad you are doing fine Hopefully we all start over peacefully
I'm glad you're back.
WE MISSED YOU
All the best to you Albert. Everyone deserves a second chance when they work towards learning from a mistake. We're all human and we're not perfect after all. Most times the hardest person to forgive is ourselves. I hope you keep on being a better you.
Side note: that’s some nice editing ngl but also I hope you make better decisions in the future :)
Yo I know that when things happens it happens so try not to blame yourself too much and hopefully learn from this and I'm really happy that you back
My man AlbertCD
🖤
Yess he is backkk
BRO I MISSED YOU SO MUCH, I hope you learned a lot through your time out of the media but I hope that you are headed in a right direction.\  Just a quite edit: Just a reminder, "Let he who has not sin cast the first stone". Let's be mindful that's he's human and makes mistakes just like the rest of us. We shouldn't condone such behavior that was displayed in the past but I do believe in forgiveness and genuine change. Try to encourage him instead of trying to kick him down!
Welcome back man, still watching it, but it’s good to see you make something.
