Just wondered how united let Dan James out,united had all the players they needed to keep,young and potentially capable of winning trophies
ZULU FOREVER
Matthew Bell is right : RUTTER ON 10 FROM NOW ON !!!!
리드 good
Rooney is useless   Hi....Rooo  Roooo Rooo !  please don't do coaching  because sice at Usa 🇺🇸 you do coaching you get ZERO score   this time tooo you will get ZERO  score.😂
Get Bamford put the squad he's worn out. Just because he's scored every leeds fanboy will be loving him until injury again
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Bamford scores one goal and now everybody who is stupid thinks he a great cf. He usually scores one goal each season after missing hundreds of goal scoring opportunities. That's just one reason why we got relegated.
Rooney for manager of the year
Two assists from Firpo🤔
what a c/f you have when he bags his first of the season in the first week of the new year.
adios rooney 😂
Bam Bam the saviour of Leeds and England. The beginning of a massive goal spree that will make Harry Kane blush.
Great win but the reality is Leeds are going to have to win 12-15 of their remaining 20 matches to get automatic promotion I should think
Happy New Year to Leeds and the fans. Victories: To PL
Ha! Love just having that piroe free kick on the end bit of a trolling of the fella, please just play piroe or bamford at 9 from now on and Rutter at ten,
Junior Firpo, remember his name and add GOAT to the end!
It is just a pleasure to see those young boys playing!❤
Bello rivedere Bamford in campo, abbiamo bisogno di un finalizzatore come lui... Forza Leeds! 👏💪🤍💛💙
Summerville is some player
Firpo on fire at last.
Gs vs. Fb derbisinden daha guzel bir mac.
Despite the win, this manager is garbage. If the team goes up- he is going to get smashed in the prem.
So happy for Bam Bam I love him to bits. Klaesson never stopped barking orders & organising the defence when they had a little bit of pressure ,Firpo with 2 assists & DJ was superb too. To all the cowards that ran away on loans ,the old guard that stayed proved what loyalty is all about today & took their chance .Don't even think about coming back. We are just fine & dandy as we are. MOT 💛💙🤍...
Why did Birmingham appoint Wayne Rooney as their coach 😳. He has been losing almost every game 😳
After two poor losses good to see an All whites win. Still not confident  about promotion.
GREAT PLAY LADS. GET IN.
Bamford opening Summervile space 🔥
Very❤
Almost half a season and the penny finally drops regarding Rutters true position ,Farke ain't our saviour
Great to see Bamford back on the score sheet!
Bye bye Rooney !! 😂😂😂
Rooney should be sacked.
We take win but Birmingham were crap, if we didn’t win this one at home, Daniel would have been sacked, now we need our home form on the road, I think we’re not going to make the top 2 but we need to keep trying.
Hope Mr Farke never shaked wazza’s hand, god only knows where that’s has bin and which old grand-ma’s! Disgusting
You lot will make the playoffs at best then do what you normally do and bottle it 👍
It's insane how much faster we move the ball at Elland Road than we do on the road.
Beating this team 😆. Leeds still look like a championship team 🙄🙄
Rutter is so good lol
Bamford🤩😍❤
Jr firpo... great knowing the guy remained at leeds regardless of being regulated❤❤  one day come bk ro barca bro
A must win so we're all happy again...let's keep it going now...well done lads. Mot.
Vamos Leeds , volvio Bamford  un gran jugador ganamos bien 3 a 0 , como me gusta esa camiseta es hermosa , vamos Leeds 💪 arrancamos súper el 2024 por más triunfos .
I don't support either of these teams, I'm just loving seeing Rooney struggle. I've always said great players very rarely make great managers and he's a perfect example of that. If he's got any humility about him he'll resign.
you can tell how much it means to bamford
Rooney getting sacked in the morning
Summerville is soon due for the orange lions
이 경기는 진짜 리즈가 더 강해졌단 것을 보여주는 경기다 너무 깔끔한 연계 플레이를 보여주네
Well done Patrick.Never have I been so pleased to see someone score
Here's how it is. We beat a shit team at home so Farke will say his selection of Bamford is justified. I don't want Bamford starting again. Why on earth has it took this long for Farke to start Rutter at No10 and why hasn't he put the far better finisher than Bamford, Piroe at No9 in this match? Piroe must be scratching his head. "Hotshot" Bamford isn't the answer and now he'll be first on the next team sheet. We'll be back to Preston & West Brom in no time. Seen it all before and its getting all too predictable...
Good to see sick note finally justifying his wage.
Even when in real bad scoring shape, Bamford knows how to stretch defenses, press, and defend. He should always be starting as 9 and Georgi as 10, makes more sense!  I like Piroe, but he is more of a poacher (also on poor scoring form) but does a lot less when defending.
Well it took him long enough to figure out Rutter is not a no 9, but feel sorry for Piroe played out of position then gets dropped when this manager finally realised his mistake but let's see against Swansea another away game
I’m legit so happy to see Bamford score again
All Bamford wants is confidence and hopefully that goal will kick start his season
A needed win...
New year,  Clean sheet 3 Goals  3 points  Happy New Year Everyone  ALAW 🤍💙💛MOT
I ONLY watch highlights on Leeds United Official as they're the only ones who respect the club enough to consistently call them Leeds United not just Leeds. Please be quick to let me know if I'm being a DH about this but it's important to me, and,I hope , most Leeds United fans.
That defender took one in the mush at 1.42, I got a similar one on Wortley Rec back in the day, I was attacking the wrong way for about two minutes afterwards.
Oh man Bamford scored. Made me very happy
Firpo & Bamford on form, that’s a Brucie Bonus for 2024. MOT.
When is Rooney going to get sacked he has won 2 of 15 games since he took over , Birmingham City were is in 6th place when he took over now they are in 20th place
Klaesson in goal! It's about fucking time! Where the hell has he been?
So so so pleased for Pat. He’s a lovely lad and he’s been out of form and injury issues. On his day he’s a hell of a player and gives a 110% every game
... Midfield line works good today, 🎉 Daniel James actions was pretty well 🖤
LEEDS OLE!..(Pantelis Ninis, Athens, Greece)
The return of Bam Bam Bamford?  Let us hope this is a sign of a goal scoring run, also his link play was excellent
Great to see Paddy getting one.
Good stuff, happy for Bamford, we needed that result. MOT, ALAW, Brighton White.
Both firpo and Bamford keeping all the neigh sayers quiet! Both had a great game
Good game filpo was great is going to be better this year
2 assists for Firpo👀
Nice to see Rutter today, coming deep picking the ball up and picking a pass brought the best out in bamford too!
WE’RE 7 POINTS AWAY FROM IPSWICH. Just gotta beat Cardiff and preston to get on a consistent run. How hard can that be. 😅
This club ❤
Crying out for Rutter at no 10 position all season😀 and what about Firpo 🤯
So happy for Bamford. Hope he can get back to form now...
STOP PUTTING THE F-ING SCORE ON THE THUMBNAIL FFS
A much needed win , but it was a desperate Birmingham team. Let's hope that win wakes our season up again.
Rooney doing an amazing job with Birmingham! Give him a new long term bumper contract 😂
Christ they were poor Beeston st Anthony s woulda beat them 4-0
Made up for Bamford, come on patrick get us winning away now  💛 💙 🤍  ALAW
they beat Birmingham Citaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Is every team we thrash at home so poor? Give the players credit for a fine home record.
Leeds win its Bamfords fault.
Rutters pass to firpo for 3rd somwthig else... class
So glad Farke has finally played Rutter in the 10, we need poachers uo top and creativity behind, and he certainly has that
Bamford les goooooo cmon Leeds!!!!!
Them losses to poor sides have cost dearly RN . That piroe effort at the end was pure lazy standards 😂😂
marshal mathers scored :o
Just watching the highlights alone you could possibly say leeds had borderline clinical Finnishing.
We still need to move on from Bamford, Cooper, Ayling and Firpo. They are not good enough for Leeds United. Even if we need to pay them off or pay half their wages at their new clubs we need to move on. They are liabilities.
WATCHING BLUES IS LIKE WATCHING A SHAKESPEAR PLAY ( COMEDY OF ERRORS ) MY GRANNY COULD HAVE SAVED 2 OF LEADS GOALS.
Birmingham Shitty 😂😂 UTV!🦁💪
I was at the match ….good break for Bamford and a much needed 3 points ( never in any danger) Let’s not get carried away …this Birmingham team is very poor RUTTER had a blinder …he was everywhere …they didnt know what to do with him apart from leg him up . Summerville is a menace to all teams …he takes them on and is always dangerous . BUT my favourite is James !!!…he scores …he sets goals up …he chases back and wins the ball  He always outpaces the opposition ….don’t underestimate his contribution . The others played well …but Firpo worries me every time he gets near the ball or somebody takes him on . I get nervous every time he’s playing tippy tap with Cooper and the goalie in their own area . Why do it ?? Overall …going in the right direction ….let’s stop giving Farke some stick and get behind him 100%
so happy to see Bamford Smile again
Birmingham absolutely woeful and Rooney won’t see out February.
Congratulations everyone.  Great start to 2024... here's to more of the same. 🙂🟡🔵⚪⚽️
Let's hope Bamford now starts the next few games. He looks hungry.  LEEDS LEEDS LEEDS ✊✊✊ MOT
Those who knock bamford don’t no football and a quick to forget ALAW
Well played lads ❤❤❤
Brilliant Save From Kristoffer Klaesson  The Norwegian Sensational + Goal Summerville, Daniel James & Patrick Bamford.   Start New Year 2024 After Defeat Leeds United Back To Winners Against Birmingham City In The Elland Road Stadium Score By 3-0.  Commentator : Bryn Law.
That 3rd goal was a thing of Beauty ... Juniors pass was sublime 👏
If I was Piroe I'd be feeling pretty disrespected by the manager. He's been played out of position this season then he gets benched and Rutter is played as a 10
Great to see Bamford score. Great guy, great player. Loved how he didn't try to claim Summervilles goal as well.
We start the New year on a good note. Happy for Bamford that he is on the score sheet and he was unlucky that hit the post.keep the consistancy Leeds if we want to be promoted. Happy New year to all.
Hard to imagine Birmingham were flying 6th in table  and out of no where they sack their manager because they want some one more modern and appealing to the public hmmmmmmmmmmm   thats worked out well then
All played well, firpo setting up some nice goals.
Blimey, thank goodness. Well 1st off, let's have it right, Birmingham were poor. 2nd Paddy showed some good awareness, and it's nice to see him break that duck, plus I think that maybe the 1st center forwards header from open play all.season. Rutter got every free kick going, he did play well, seems the gap between defensive midfield and center forward got filled nicely. Oh, and whilst firpo got 2 assists, my god, you wouldn't know he was playing left back for large parts of the game, can you imagine that against that lad who played on the right for west brom the other week🙈 we'd get murdered. Okay, and lastly, we know Byram can be a little bit injury prone, so, let's not ask him to play 2 games a week, he often gets through a lot of yards too. Let's hope Piroe studies Paddy's positioning and movement, and maybe paddy can study piroes shooting, though at their ages, I don't think paddy can really improve, but piroe can. Anyway, 3 points, thank feck
Great win today the team did really well 👍
Good old Bamfotd, Knew his would luck would change at some point!
Play klassen all the time
Bamford getting a chance and making a statement 😮
6 pointer today both Southampton and Ipswich drew today happy days well done guys
Statue in goal with T. Rex arms.
Kleason is miles better than meslier and darlow.
always in elland road. Away is completely different. Southampton and leicester win home and away and are favorites for the first 2 positions. Leeds need to be consistent away otherwise will go to the play offs
Bamford‼️
Commentator sounds as outdated as the marching on together song we sing
Wow,,at last Patrick is on the scoresheet,,well done lads,,MOT….❤
After the year of crap he has had I smiled when Bamford scored.  Hope the boy has found his way again. MOT!
Why did it take so long to see Rutter is no #9 and with one we will score more goals, Rutter is #10 all day long
Good Win pleased Patrick scored given his chance and it's paid off I would start Patrick again against the Posh just shows that Mr Rutter isn't a No 9 he played well in the No 10 role gave the big man chances to roam more on the Park 🏞️ pleased Dan James scored again and Two assists by Mr Firpo 🤩 come on the 49ers we still need a Left back and No 10 if possible but GEORGINIO you played very well in the No 10 position keep fighting Leeds our away form has to improve for the run for promotion brilliant Lads marching on together we all love Leeds 🦚🇮🇨👊✊🤍💛💙
The end 😂 nope
Sign a proper number 9 this window (basically someone with Bamford's profile but just better) and a LB and we get automatic promotion lads 👍
Glad to see bamford looking pretty good in the match
Great start to the year, lets get some momentum going.
Decent win but our fans still singing Saville chants are a disgrace.
Top RESILIENCE from the boys💪
Love my boy BB9 getting on the scoresheet. ALAW
Rutter number 10 from now on please, he was unplayable at times today. He's not a natural goalscorer but a damned good player ⚽👍
We need all of our games to be at Elland Road
👍👌
Glad to see bamford score
