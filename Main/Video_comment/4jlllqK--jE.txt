Pause at 6:22 there’s two diallo
PSG fancy winning the champions league? really? they were taken apart by Strasbourg's goals, and Strasbourg are a pub team in the grand scheme of things....what a joke.
The fact that messi chose to rot in the french league shows why CR7 is the GOAT
PSG......Founded in 1970.......The ultimate plastic club with no history!!!!
Mbappe is unfuckin real his movement foot work is second to none the best player for me on the planet and care if he's in a farmers league
why do other teams in the league even bother at this point
Never a yellow 🤦🏽‍♂️
Never was a sending off challenge
The first goal was offside 😂😂
The accurate, non-click-bait title made me click and watch this ngl
Mbappe what a game
With this PSG team, they should win all the trophies.
dead league
ngl I miss wijnaldum *I'm a Liverpool fan*
The French league has never been interesting - even now
what an atmposphere
First goal offside?
Didn't show poch once!
What a shame he chose this terrible league! England, German or Italy would have been a far more interesting choice!
Should have had their third great effort from Strasbourg
Messi looks like a cat looking at birds.
2nd division English league
Why was messi staring like that
Nice to see wijnaldum happy at Paris
PSG raised there ticket prices just for messi not to be playing if I were PSG fans I would be outraged and demanding refunds
5:44   Messi: 😳
Or on the bench
Hey wasn’t messi playing
a better team would've equalised
Nobody is talking about how the first goal was offside?
lmao all the plastic fans
Psg is the new Real Madrid and Barcelona
How come Neymar was not playing at least or Messi?
The only thing with PSG is they have an insane attack, insane midfield, world class keeper but I wouldn’t say their back 4 is top 5/6 in the world, could be their downfall
PSGs defence is joke, should have focused there rather than on messi
95 percent of these comments are anti PSG and yet as I walk around London I see more PSG shirts than anything else
How is icardi not offside for the first goal???
messi doesnt even play in the game and yet he is still in the title of the video, he's that type of famous
The standard of football is an absolute joke 🤣
Mbappe needs to enjoy his time with Messi and learn his football and wait for Ronaldo to join to.
Look how bad they are at the back. Once they face a decent side they'll crumble. Worst over hyped team in Europe. Mbappe needs to move on and prove himself in a tough league, not a 1 sided league like Ligue 1
The LEGENDS are sitting together
Qatar have a football team better than qatar
I'm confused. I thought it was qatar Vs Strasbourg?
We have to wait till champions league to see How good they are
PSG  Defence is still weak
What is the point of this league anymore. PSG are just gonna run riot!
*Why does their Short's like the same as Chicago bull's shorts*
How is that first goal not offside?
Messi doesn't like ikadi
Farmers league
I thought Messi didn’t like Icardi?
Keylor who?
defending is so bad in France
The blind school league!!!!!!
That "messi watches on" is the only reason this video is getting clicked on
This must be the easiest league to win 🙄
If Ligue 1 teams were premier league teams  PSG - Man City  Monaco - Chelsea Marseille - Liverpool/Man Utd  Lyon- Arsenal  Lille - Leicester  St Ettienne -- Aston Villa Lens - Leeds  Nice- Spurs  Nantes -Everton
Farmers league
Defending for PSG wasnt the best, shouldn't be conceding 2 at Strasbourg
Of course messi had to go to a mickey mouse league
PSG very good only in France 🇫🇷
Mbappe is class!  And I didn't realise how many Argentinians PSG have.
uno messi just thinking i cant waite to hold the ucl trophy this season. i have been watching psg games for the past 2 or 3 seasons and honestly their a well oiled team that can play very good football, this team is perfect for the goat to do what he does, he no longer needs to carry a whole team
I’ll say it now. Messi can have 60+ Goal contributions with Ligue 1 defence. Will not be shocked
I am from the future, they will lose to Chelsea in the last 8
Icardi offside
5:45 what’s messi been taking?
Pub league.
This league is awful 😩
What is messis face at 5:44 😭
This league is embarrassing
and the flag stays down here ..... well ermmm yeah he's recieved the ball from the opposing psg player he could of been standing on the goal line and still been on side
Still leaking goals though.....
They still seem to be struggling in certain areas of their game like last season. And these are not good teams they are playing against. Everyone's talking about this star studded squad but I wouldn't be surprised if they get undone at the champions league this year.
No VaR?
Cult...
Isnt there no VAR in the french league? First goal was clearly offside fml
How’s the first goal not offside?😂
4th goal my favourite choice of assists and goal I use on fifa
What an amazing result. Cant believe PSG beat them. Well done
*uck PSG, an absolute disgrace they can have about 600m worth of players not even in the matchday squad
No Donnarumma, no Messi, no Neymar, no Di Maria, no Ramos… I can only imagine what’s gonna happen when dem lots eventually play
what a goal that first goal
Imagine Strasbourg had 11 men... possibly may have got a point out of this. I hope the rest of the league takes the game to PSG and be as courageous as we don't want PSG to have it too easy.
Messi is licking his lips when he knows ligue 1 is fully with amateur teams 🤣
soon things are going to get Messy
Who love to see the books of the top teams. How PSG, City etc. stay within FFP regs is a mystery.
mbappe going past defenders easy, proper farmers league and pub team defending
0:41 First goal clearly offside. Is there VAR in french league?
After all the chances he got in this game alone, people will STILL overhype Mbappe. Honestly he's the most overhyped player in modern history. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤡🤡
where are all the fanboys accusing CR7 of playing in a farmers league lmfao.... this is a farmers league! the biggest actually lol
Messi could have competition in attack!
this might make me look stupid but why is neymar not playing
Mbappe is rubbish..his a player for a season or 2 that's it not long term players likes Messi and Ronaldo
5:45
The BT PSG wankfest continues..
Icardi deserved a yellow for going down like he had been shot more than the defender did for the initial foul
is it just me or is Icardi clealry offside for the first goal?
Clearly offside first goal. Not even close. VAR not on?
It's going to an absolute walk in the park.....sorry, I mean walk on the farm for Messi.  An Arab billionaire's show pony in a field full of donkeys.
Piss poor league full of players with no appetite for regular hard ball..easy Street , creaming in the cash from gullible french fans.
Best header I’ve seen
How has messi come from barcelona and not had to isolate? Yet every other transfer has had to do so?
Yeah they will dominate this farmers league.  But they won't even make the final of UCL this year. PSG just aren't amongst Europe's elite.
Who’s that put donnaruma in goal
They will win the domestic league and Cup but its the champions league can they win tho
Draxler is still hard
An embarrassingly un-competitive and unfair league with PSG as they are now.  Every win and trophy they achieve is bought and paid for, not earned.  Thats pretty much football in the 21st century though but its no more evident than here and now!
only if ibrahimovic stayed in psg
Most corrupt league in the world 😂
Referee saved there’s arse’s gave a yellow that wasn’t a yellow sent a player off just as the opposition were one goal away from drawing and had momentum he ruined the game
Pisses me off how all these top players are playing in this league
Mbape the gazelle!
Mess is face for the 4th goal lol
PSG will need Messi to beat the likes of the mighty brest and nice, Neymar and Mbappe aren’t enough 😂
League over already
Is there no VAR in ligule one, or do PSG pay the referees contracts as well?
Worst league   no competition. Players go here for the easy life
Was hoping to see messi -_-
Mbappe is the most overrated player of the last 10 years
1st goal clearly offside? Why wasn't it checked?
Terrible league. PSG are also terrible defensively
This league is to hard for messi
If PSG get Ronaldo aswell they have the best team of all time
Mickey Mouse league
Strasbourg are like a league 2 team .. farmers league
farmers league lmao
The old boys Messi and Ramos will reminisce about the good ol' days at their new retirement home in league 1 🤣🤣
Regardless of whos up top defensivley they arent good. Wont win a champions league.....
Ref had a stinker with that red reckon PSG would’ve lost if strasborg didn’t have 10 men
6:27 the flag stays down, well obviously it would the psg player passed it back
wait wtf is going on at PSG did they buy all the players in the world or something? Messi, Neymar, di Maria, Ramos, Paredes, Donaruma etc who did not even play this match but the bench damn that's some bench
Welcome to the worst league in Europe
I can’t see Poch lasting at PSG - he’s not the type of manager those marquee players need neither does he have the winning experience at big big games - I can see Zidane in there by mid season
PSG = Career mode on fifa!!! Totally forgot they had Icardi too
The French league is so poor, no wonder Messi has gone in his twilight years. They won't win the champions league either
They are still not going to win champions league!
What a farmers league. PSG is more like an exhibition 😂
Psg are a bunch of weapons in a bad way but
Lol leaking goals against Strasbourg ... Ain't winning no champions League playing like that.
First goal was offside
Messi thinking of a 40 goal season when he gets started 😂😂😂😂
Genuine question. How does one defend against mbappe his legs move at lightning speed ⚡️
First goal was offside wtf
What a boring league
Messi 🐐
Mbappe has got so much hate it’s got to the point where he is underrated
Still with all that talent they’re conceding 2 goals at home to Strasbourg 😅 Even conceding a goal in this league should be embarrassing considering the gap in quality.
Don’t know how Messi & Neymar can start in this team let alone make it on the pitch at all?
"The flag stays down here", pass back by a PSG player and he weren't even offside anyway
Everyone looking forward to see Messi, Ramos, and and Donnarumma.  But instead we got Hakimi and Wijnaldum debut instead LOL.
0:40 surely that shows clear offside for the first goal!?? Am I missing something?
If Messi doesn't beat his scoring record this season, I'll be disappointed. Ligue 1 is a shambles, theres really no excuse for PSG to not win the league unbeaten.
Psg with that team still conceded 2 to strasbourg 🤣🤣
Can’t wait until all the new signings play together
Messi has won the champions league once in the last decade. How is he going to win it for PSG? Lol.  Ramos is the one who’s won it four times in the last decade.
imagine if they got railed like 5-0 infront of their new signings
Psg defence is shocking
Imagine if PSG go all out to bring Ronaldo in for 2 seasons or so to join Messi, Neymar and Mbappe. 😏😌😂 It'll be the greatest attack line up of the decade and awesome to see them guys play together! Just imagine it... It'll be like watching a Pepsi or sports advert.
Mbappe is going to have multiple assists this season.
If the manager looses and doesn't win any trophy this season his coaching licence should be removed
First goal was offside, red card harsh. Say no more
If they don’t win any trophies with this superteam, that’s just embarrassing
First goal offside? The worse defending I've seen in competitive football. Now I get why I see so many people calling it the farmers league.
First goal was offside definitely i really wished messi would of came to the premier league so much more competitive but maybe he's just looking for easy goals and better statistics 🤔
Tbf to Strasbourg they are 2 fantastic headers hahaha
KIMPEMBE IS SO TERRIBLE
All the players taking turns to sit next to Messi 😂
With this psg team I consider any goal they concede to be a defeat.
They just don’t look convincing too me , I dunno ..
No one gunna talk about how Icardi was twisting his face and holding his leg like he had just been bitten by a shark? Players still cheating and deceiving and no one blinks an eye
How the hell the VAR did not step in for the first goal? Clearly offside, don't they have in in France?
Poor league, zzzzz
5:22 “messi watches on”
I'm looking forward to seeing Messi playing for PSG for he will have a great time playing against a lower standard of football defenders.
Nothing like Ac Milan, Seria A at the time was the by far the best league in the world and in 91/92 season they conceded 21 goals. Not saying this PSG team isn't going to dominate the league this season, but there's no comparison to that Ac milan team
Mbappe winning the game off deflections 😂
Dont icardi and Messi doing get on ?
Seeing Gini in a shirt that isn't a Liverpool one is making me feel some type of way.
They didn’t even have di Maria, pastore, messi, neymar and Sergio Ramos on the pitch 🤯
Criminal if PSG don't win the UCL. Their squad is lethal 🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥
I'm thinking they have beaten a team 4-2 without Messi neymar and Di Maria imagine what's it gonna be like when they all play 😲
imagine not needing neymar, messi or do maria and still clapping your opponents 4-2  this team on fifa 22 is better than any ultimate team but can think of
Mark my words they will still not win the Champions League
How come he didnt play
1st goal offside.
Good attack defence is poor
👩‍🌾👩‍🌾👩‍🌾👩‍🌾👩‍🌾👩‍🌾🚜🚜🚜🚜🚜🚜🚜🚜🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽
It won't be long till there will be reports of training ground bust ups, and people not liking each other.
He went to psg for money and not a challenge unlike Ronaldo..he should have moved to toughest league just to cement himself
If PSG doesn't reach the final of UCL with this team I will be shocked.
The first one was clearly offside
If they were in England that side they would be in the championship
Absolute joke of a league. Commentators are just as bad. How was that first goal not given as offside
Conceding two goals against what even is that club
Wonder who going to win the league boring
Harlem Globetrotters Vs French  farmers week in week out...
All those money…a they are not even that effective…I mean they just managed to get through..first 2 goals lucky as well…Red card for opponent it’s just a joke….so they have got referee on their side as well…PSG it’s like a fifa player putting his settings at 100 and opponents on 50…and let’s have “real” challenge…no wonder they can’t do a thing in Champions league…cause they su***
If they don’t win the champions league this team will be considered a failure. I’d say the french league is a given
wait until messi makes his debut the world will be watching
Messi needs to win one if not two minimum CL cups
5:42 messi r u ok ?
I want to sit next to messi, neymar “ but thats my seat” di maria “ move i sit by messi”
No player who wants a challenge would play in the French league, literally 2 - 3 decent teams in the whole division and the gap between PSG and the rest is massive, the fact Lille won the league last year shows how complacent the PSG players are.  To me this is what separates Cristiano Ronaldo from the rest, he's done it in nearly every top league and has always challenged himself. The likes of Mbappe, Neymar and Messi don't want to play in the EPL because they know they will struggle  and their stock will drop, they would rather play for the PSG Globetrotters knowing if they perform at 70% they will look like superstars, unfortunately when they play decent teams in the CL they don't look anything special.
Great team......some wage bill though....
Watch them crumble against city and Bayern lool
Defensively shambolic at PSG
Cant see them wining anything more than domestic trophies
Chocolate league
Strasbourg was Messi’s toughest test to date with Brest & Lorient also troubling the wee man
Lille won ligue 1 last season most ppl saying ligue 1 is like beginner on fifa u never know its football
kimpembe is so bad
Damn the defenses on both teams are SHOCKING...
The new galacticos!
Scottish league is higher quality.
Wasn’t it offside for Icardi’s goal?
Very dangerous going forward but if there conceding against these teams champions league trophy ain’t coming back to Paris they gonna face a strong Bayern chelsea Liverpool Manchester City and united & CR7 just to name a few heavyweights it won’t be a walk in the park as they have experienced already season after season and Messi can’t help the defence as we’ve seen for years whenever Barca have been knocked out the competition so this season should be interesting and fun to watch but Messi fans and PSG fans better not just expect CL trophy
Probably score 8 with Messi & Neymar in the team
First goal should have been ruled out for offside.
whits the goalie dain tam
Crazy how psg get away with spending that amount of money on players wages but when barca do it its illegal. Double standards when your a 1 team league. There reserves get paid more than most newcastle players
Farmers league
Il faut travailler la defense.
Scottish teams can forget it.our top 2 teams Rangers & celtic are nowhere near good enough to compete with teams like PSG.
Is pep is going to PSG as manager. ..??
That second yellow is a joke. Also they not have VAR in France? First goal was offside surely?
6:25 “the flag stays down here” wow i could easily be a commentator if this is how clever they are
Psg have created a World x11, this team if jelled correctly will dominate europe
Man Mbappe is literally Thierry Henry. His movement, pace, confidence, precision are just so killer. I really hope if some eternal spirit allows, to please come to Arsenal and fulfill the prophecy.
6:26 'The flag stays down here' when he can't be offside from a back pass from the opposition. Do the commentators even know the rules?
Why isn't Messi playing??
First goal looked offside
Mbappe was playing like scouts were watching, man was trying to impress Messi I feel it tho 🤣
Messi really signed with PSG to play against pleb teams like this week in week out?  If he had signed for City we could've seen him play week in week out against teams like Chelsea, Liverpool, United, Leicester, spurs 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️.
If Messi was as good as Ronaldo, he would have gone to a tougher league like the Premier League or Serie A... instead he chose a Mickey mouse league for the money. Messi is nowhere as near as Ronaldo in terms of talent.
Bro why is the French league so sick?
If the PSG bench formed their own team they would finish second in the league 😂 wtf
All that money spent just to wi legue 1 🤦🏿‍♂️
This could be the best team we ever see, sit and enjoy
Messi neymar di Maria and ramos sitting in the stands they are going to be frightening this season
Chelsea can still beat this side
Donnarumma would have kept a clean sheet
Header looked like it reshaped mans forehead
Iv got a feeling this the beginning of a bee era for psg a couple of champions league title runs and then back to normal but if they don’t win it with this all star team they never will
Messi: *sits in the crowd to watch a game*  Messi: *makes the headline*
Kimpembe is a liability..with Ramos arriving hopefully it's his last game
Poor Icardi.... say hello to the bench soon 🙄
This Paris team is dumb. What a squad …
Mbappe footwork for 3rd goal is world class
4-2 even without Messi, Neymar, Ramos, Di Maria, Donnarumma and Veratti... damn PSG gonna be mad this year.
Mbappe is like a mix between ribery and ronaldo.
PSG defence definitely has a loophole a lot of good teams will exploit. Don't see them winning the UEFA league this season! Still weak defensively.
PSG are overrated, conceding 2 goals to a team fighting relegation, getting luckily deflection goals too. They won’t win in Europe.
Messi should finish the season with atleast 50+ leagues goals no excuses
Wijnaldum..Liverpool legend.
Mbappe just lacks the clinical finishing of a Haaland.
What a header from Ajorque!
Messi is licking his lips. Even at 50% he's dominating this league.
Kimpembe 🤡 😂😂😂
It’s got a to a point that if PSG conceded in any game that’s not a CL side in Ligue 1 it was an embarrassing game… if they don’t win the league, it’s embarrassing. There’s no excuses for them now
Straight after the Qatar World Cup (21 November to 18 December 2022), PSG will be in the group of clubs pushing for a European Super League.
Jesus PSG are awful defensively
I reckon psg will do well in the CL but the defending could let them down. But they have messi so just hand them the trophy ig
Messi should have a field day with this league
BT somehow managed to include Messi's name in the title. I have the feeling all PSG's games will somehow have Messi's name mentioned in it.
At this point they should start the season by handing the ligue 1 trophy to PSG. I know Lille won the last one but this is getting ridiculous. The gap is too immense. I bet Messi's salary covers the entire Strasbourg's players salaries.
the reserves are messi ramos neymar and di maria we are in trouble
It's a shame the worlds greatest player has gone to such a terrible league but I guess money talks.
6:22 What does he mean "the flag stays down" ?? It was a PSG player who kicked it back. He cannot be offside. What?
What an absolute joke of a league, gone are the days players want to be remembered as legends,all of them  just after an easy pay cheque.. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Winjaldum is hard worker, he show his energy the PSG... YNWL !
Ref having to step in and save PSG,
“The flag stays down here”.  Well of course it does, it was a PSG player who made the pass.
Messi thinking “there’s like 12 Eibars in this league “ 😂😂
French teams are all rubbish no caliber cant win in Europe lol
Ibra scored 50 goals for PSG when he was in his mid 30s. Messi will score a hundred. Easy.
PSG win Ligue 1 21/22: Of course they will win it with there team PSG don't win Ligue 1 21/22: How did they not win Ligue 1 this year, there team is so good and they lose to farmers PSG can never win
Wow big surprise they won, Stop milking the Messi signing ,it's still a low level league, that know one gives a toss about
I’m surprised Messi was there, thought he’d be at home counting his money...for the sake of football, this nobody team with Arab money, should never have given this mercenary a job...
PSG are still behind Chelsea, City and United
No wonder PSG always crumble in the Champions League. They play such terrible quality opposition every weekend that when they actually come up against good teams in the Champions League they panic and get overwhelmed. The only reason PSG got to the final 2 seasons ago is because of the 1 leg knockout rounds and no fans due to Covid. Even with the 1 leg knockout rounds they almost bottled it and got knocked out by Atalanta I think it was?
Donnerumma  Hakimi   Marquinhos    Ramos   Bernat                         Veratti            Paredes         Wijnaldum         Messi    Mbappe     Neymar
The easiest league for a team to win by far.. PSG is going to demolish this league by far
Pub league
First goal offside, second took a wicked deflection and the cross for the third took another wicked deflection that left took the keeper completely out of it and left Draxler with an open net.
Good team, but individuals don't win trophies. A team does. PSG won't even make the final of the champions league. Need a year to adapt.
Mbappe is good no doubt. But starting to think he's over rated. It takes him over 5 attempts to score. Haaland over mbappe for me
Farmers league
Psg have bought the league
Poor standard in ligue 1. Messi took the easy option 👌
0:42 he's offside 🤣👏👏👏💯
I think Messi will allow Icardi back into the Argentina team.
Messi to score 100 goals this season
Why is Messi not playing?
Cannot wait for the full squad to be ready
french league is boring and nowhere near best league in world
If Lewa can score +30 in the budesliga then imagine Messi in this farmers league
Messi may have to double up his tally of goals and assists to get Ballon dor...this league is maybe lower ranked than others...
It's the equivalent of seal clubbing in the French league
0:19 has pastore retired?
OMG PSG FLAMED THIS SHI UP 🔥
Anyone know if the pink and purple PSG shirt is still available? Been looking everywhere but can’t find one
Didn't think Messi would go to the farmers league
they may have the best attackers in the world...but that defence needs some work!
Mbappe going back to looking amazing now he back in he farmers league, where was Mbappe in the Euros ??
If this doesnt showcase the kind of league this is....
Messi knows Mbappé is great player
How did they concede!!!
I don’t really understand the commentary sometimes. 6:22 he says ‘the flag stays down here’. Why would it go up? It was the defender who passed back. Are the commentators not watching the match?
Joke club. Hope someone absolutely hammers them.
Narr Messi is probably thinking, "why did our super team just concede two goals from the farmers who work down the street!?"
Psg will struggle again in CL with that defence. ..
kimbempe was awful
It’s the french league. Like Man Utd playing in our championship.
Messi should have just come to Man Utd
Most of the comments are negative... Guys don't show your frustration ans jealousy too much xD
FOR those who say Messi wouldn't be able to do it in the premier league name one player better than him and won as man ballon dors as him in premier league no one that's who
Wheres Ramos?
00:40 How is this not offside? I really don't get the rules anymore. He's clearly offside.
5:45 wtf is messi doing
I dont rate Kimpembe, the only weakness in psgs team is the defence except for Marquinos.
Mbappe what a plurr
When Ramos comes into the team kimpembe better look for a new club.
5:37 Why is the defender moving away from the ball 😭
Messi will tear this league apart playing against binmen n takeaway delivery drivers
Chelsea video?????????😒 Eroupen is blue 💙
Hopefully Mbappe will leave this boring league
Crazy how people think messi needs to prove something especially in the PL.. how many times has he scored against PL teams in his career in champ league!! Guys won nearly everything and getting older might as well cash in
Messi is the new player/manager
Mbappe is definitely a winger, just not quite as clinical and a haaland
Mbappe was class
The first goal was offside…?
Bet the fan boys say this is a hard league when messi plays when PSG’s second team have just won a game😂😂
PSG need to sort there defence out mann 2 goals conceded is bad
4:27: ALLEZ PARIS *concedes*
Messi is a coward imo he went to the french league the only team in it is psg they gonna win it should have gone to the prem where he would be challenged every game he took the easy option ronaldo is by miles a better player and person he is
They conceded 2? Eeesh.
FARMERS LEAGUE LOL
The league needs more quality other teams need to invest, who even is the best player there that don’t play for PSG?😂
All money no heart or history, hate PSG but can’t deny there gonna play some good football.
Really feel for Messi, going to be tough for him to find form in this league.
Messi is licking his lips and this and thinking “if this is the standard then I’m having a field day very day “
It was offside for first goal wasnt  it?
First goal offside and a soft red card.  Anyway PSG will win the league easily so... didnt really matter.
Strasbourg lost but lowkey gassed that Messi didn't play surely 😭😭
Mbappe very good attacking player very skilfull but misses so many 1 on 1s I mean so many
Psg's defence is shocking
And people were buying tickets for this match for crazy money thinking they’d get to watch Messi play 😂
Mbappe once again showing how skilled, fast, agile and powerful he is with the ball, incredible
The quality of defending across the EPL German and France is utter rubbish.
Mark my words Even with Messi they cannot win Champions League.
1st goal offside?
Who'd of thought they'd beat a bad team
If this team don’t achieve anything it’s a shambles honestly
Damn PSG might actually win something outside of ligue 1 this season 😳
this is a farmers league messi went to this club bc its a ez league if he went to pl he would struggle
😃👌🏾
Lol, kimpembe looking lost again, captain aswell? Is marquinhos injured? Why ain't Ramos playing lol
Was first goal not offside?
Everytime I watch the french league I’m dumbfounded by the lack of quality on the lower league teams. Goals conceded were some sunday league defending.
If they don't walk the league and win the champions League it'll be hilarious. Well tbf they will walk the farmers league but when it comes to the champions League there's actually decent teams to play against.
PSG has become the new AC Milan with this mega team they’ve assembled, if they have a trophy less season I will be dumbfounded
If PSG lose a 22yr old Mbappe to accommodate this circus they will regret in two years when Messi leaves for either the US or retirement and Neymar heads somewhere else for certain eventually .
As good as PSGs squad is they just seem to lack the mentality, not to mention the defensive stability. One of my least favourite teams to watch, which is incredible given the talent they have...
Poch isn't winning the ucl. Not this year anyway
I miss Gini🥲 It makes me smile to see himself happy
psg need to keep mbappe selling mbappe for messi is the most stupid things psg can do  messi is not the same messi he was 5 years ago
psg need to keep mbappe selling mbappe for messi is the most stupid things psg can do  messi is not the same messi he was 5 years ago
People were reselling these tickets for thousands to see Messi and…
psg need to keep mbappe selling mbappe for messi is the most stupid things psg can do  messi is not the same messi he was 5 years ago
psg need to keep mbappe selling mbappe for messi is the most stupid things psg can do  messi is not the same messi he was 5 years ago
I’m only here to see my Gini 🔴
I miss gini at Liverpool already :(
Scary,,, no   messi, Newmar  , di maria,  ramos, marqiniois,  parades,  verati,  and donorama.   And still look  awesome
PSG in the worst league in the world and still struggle to win games it’s embarrassing 😳
Talk about a welcoming reception for all those signings☝🏼
The amount of views are gonna be people hoping the messi would’ve played
Correct me if I am wrong but Icardi was surly offside?
6:00 mbappe pace boost
This be the hottest ticket in Europe, because there will be guaranteed goals when PSG plays
First goal clearly offside.
PSG need to sort out that defence if they have any chance of winning the CL. Doesnt matter who they have up front they'll get found out like they have been the last few years.
Kimbempe back at it again with the 💩 defending🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️I knew they conceded 1 because of him before I even clicked the video
I’m surprised PSG didn’t snap up Stewart downing on a free but this messi guys is alright
of course they somehow managed to get messi in the title😭
Somehow found a way to get Messi in the title. Bt Sport understanding the YouTube game
wow messi didn’t even play and still got mentioned in the title, not neymar tho
Psg gonna dominate for the next 3 years
Can’t even keep a clean sheet against some farmer team nobody’s ever heard of smh lol
J P Return To PSG
Lionel Messi Legend
