💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
1 sec into the video and cash carried, double dribbled and travelled
HAHAHAHAHAHA! Does Cash think he's actually good? There's no way
These guys are both terrible. The one in the Pelicans jersey is bad. Fortunately for him, the one in the white tee is really bad. They both suck. Just one sucks worse
First clip that boy cash carried like a mugggg
He did it you ewcwnt game
Got sleepy on leg day I see !
Around 7:30 he dribbled it first so he could control the ball it was a bad check
Damn I wanna play cash nasty one on one!!!!!!!!
0:16
Who’s here after cash and Flight 1v1 today

🤣💀🔥
W
Man disrespecting kobe, wears the shoes but dont have talent
Cash Vs Flight is the greatest rivalry of all time!

Flight suck but we love him funny Af
Flight is ass why niggas talk about him like he nice 😂
7:20 was not a travel cash thought he could finesse a mfing finesser
Let's goo Cash
flight carried like mf the whole time
Someone tell me what shoes cash was wearing please(I think it may be the Kobe grinch’s?)
Smh they had practice??? Wow they both light work🤣😂🤣
To be honest if I knew flight as a friend I would honestly try to help him get better he looks like a beginner.
0:01 did you just double dribbled??
NO HATE But it’s no reason flight should rip you bro , That was disappointing to see
6 months later and I’ve watched this 12 1/2 times
That was the most ugliest game I've ever saw
10:57 Dude aint all there in the head bruh.
Flight is always going to be delusional
*Flight moves* Kenny: ooo
Two of the WORST Shooters i ever saw play Ball!
Double
Flight was breathing heavy
Flight will call everything and still loose
False calls with multiple cameras? How????
Yall bothh are terrible terrible at this sport
flight looking like the salamander from geicko
even after all this time they still suck
this game had enough bricks to build a city
You love to see it
Flight be tired after 2 minutes of playing dawg 😂😂😂
Bro, I see people talking about how good flight is...I never seen him ever play good.
Flight is beyond terrible lmaooooo 😬💯
In 7:20 sec. that was a double dribble from flight
That intro lmOooo its coo but also cringe af how flight voice just screamed in there😂
Do you and flight play with the cameras off
Cash double dribbled lol
4:24 when he unlock them sigs?😂🔥
How is this fools name flight. More like grounded
Flight looks like a 2k PG
Y’all didn’t check up
Can someone put me & cash on a court like irl bc I will embarrass him I don’t want it to be on video neither just want him to tweet he “lost bad today” then y’all gonna know he lost to me ‼️💯
flight thinking he's stronger than cash is fucking hilarious💀
Here we go with flight making excuses again.
I need cash to come to New York or i pull up to him! He would not beat me 100%
Really low shooting percentage.  Most shots were uncontested too.
Nootrofoic lol
Flight is terrible 😭😭😭
Yikes. Wtf sport they playing?
Bricks are Life.
Poopists 💩🤡
I must said Flight has me impressed with how his stamina hasn't improved.
Cash thats a check up not a double dribble. Cmon bro you don’t even need to lie man you’re playing against a bot.
Flights ball no trouble
Flight always has an excuse for everything and anything
Why they not playing on neutral court that's damn not fair lol cash was bricking as well they just be throwing shots up lol
These niggas gonna be 40 and 50 playing 1v1 every year lmaoo
Simply stepping on the court agaisnt flight is bvllying 😂 lol
WHATS GOOD WITH A 1V1?
Fuck once a year, once a day would be better, flight might actually improve
wet like water = dry like sand
The glass breaking sound effect tho 💀 😂
If I played flight I would leave him open
Cash if you beat me 1v1, I’ll subscribe to your channel
content. 🤣🏀
Flight always manages to make cash and everyone else laugh even when he’s not trying to be funny🤣🤣
Da nigga cash said travel but explained a double dribble😂😂😂😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️

Flight too much excuses lol, flight really needs to work on his shots :)
You Called The Wrong Call Anyways It’s Not Travel It’s A Double Dribble.
Why cash look like kyrie  👀
Y does flight's js look like he playing leap frog
Lol this is hilarious. My guy can't play at all
Do another 2v2 with flight!
I’d love to play either one of them really I’m down in Jacksonville FL👀
Straight travel
man had 13 months to practice and said, “fuck it ima work on my between the legs for 13 months straight…” 😭😭😭😭 man didnt even improve that much😭
Flight ain't beat cash once and they been playing eachother for years
Kenny needs to coach flight on shooting again 😡
I love when flight bricks 🤣
Is crazy cause I wanted flight to win but I knew cash was gonna win
hello CashNasty you are doing well, where do you live, good health to your family
Ion rlly dnt kno how he lose to cash🤷🏽‍♂️

We may not have Magic vs Bird anymore, but we have Cash vs Flight
With all these bricks they can build a nice house.
3:00 When your abt skip the sponsor and your name is Roman
Flight freaking sucks he needs to try a different sport
he thought he ate that putting a commercial in the middle of the vid like i can’t just skip it😭😭😭😭
Man nothing against flight but bro is not good 😭
U always gone catch flight catching god breath
“That’s a problem lowkey”😂😂😂
Racist
CASH YOU NEED TO ADD MORE ARC TO YOUR SHOT CAUSE IT'S THERE JUST A LITTLE HIGHER💯💯
Cash TRAVEL 9:21
That 5th point was a travel not a euro lol
there's no way that anyone watching this isn't rooting for flight..... right?
Cash a goat for the zoom ins lmao
The two most uncoordinated basketball YouTubers out there lol 😂
Bro cash....what happened to your twitch...stream live bro
That dribble flight did though when he caught you reaching cash was kinda nice 🤣🤣🤣
Dawg. Flight said he is used to being down by double digits by half time. Isn’t half time 7 points? Lmao 😂😂😂😂
Flight did travel
Cash who did you Euro my guy😂
We all knew who would win
8:10 real cash fans I’m back I had that 1000 like comment in the cash reaction to flight basketball NO CAP FLIGHT FUNNY ASSLL “32 overall euro step”
Flight always finds a way to make excuses after losing
Damn flight crossed cash  nasty😭?At 4:25
i watched them get more rebounds than buckets
lol
Cash jump shot wet like sand paper!
Its not june thats why he lost.
Flight getting better. His bag is deeper than last June
4:20 cash was in😂
I didn’t think I had a chance to be a basketball youtuber till I saw this game. Yikes! That was tough to watch. Flight literally looks like he shoots to miss and get the rebound smh
Anyone else saw the travel in the intro by cash
Cash said euro but he didn’t euro through anybody, my guy went no where
Why he said nootrophobic? It says nootropic bro 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro can yall stop the rim cant take it no more
Flight basketball is not for everybody 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This man wearing polo socks😭😭
besides the 2 airballs, flight had no luck with the 3s. everything was in and out
I literally liked it b4 I even watched one second lol
OKAY FLIGHTT!
Super travel on Cash before the stepbacc 3 pointer during the intro.. Big Big feet shuffling going on..
Went through Traning and still suck lmao
That’s a nice house, full basketball court in the back yard
I had to roll a bacc wood an watch this 😭😭😭😭😭
bruh what is flights jumpshot
That was a double cash
you should put the 2k score board and the fouls. Maybe even a shot bar
Can Flight go pay someone to coach him how to shoot a basketball, 5th graders have better form!
you got to shoot and than look at the camera right away
Flight smoke too much weed 😂
Flight handles worst den his shot percentage
Camera men lame asf
Wait hol up did Cash really show a double dribble in the very first clip of the video lmaoo
Yoo
Why tf do I keep wasting my time watching flight hoop
Idiots that say Carlos could beat flight 😆 Carlos would foul half the time to give him extra points
I was here for the very first it’s wild to see how much time flies
Flight yu kan not be serious bruh yu been playing against these dudes for years & you still shxty how ??????

Why is Royce O'Neal playing Flight?
Flight 🗑

🤣🤣🤣2v1 and I would cook them 🤣🤣like lord
Cash really can’t shoot it’s crazy
Bro how do people watch flight mans is garbage 🗑
I like how cash plays like James harden
Cash when you get dribble moves… that step back 3 was kinda clean 😅
this belongs to the circus
His jumpers like a robot, thats cool😁✌🔥🔥
Bro the little change in flight’s game is heartbreaking, I thought after you train your supposed to get better XD
FLIGHT TEAM STAND UPPPP🤣🤣🤣
Imagine getting excited everytime you score.
This gotta be one of the most pathetic videos I’ve ever seen
Flight really the type of dude who just sees what he wants to see😂
They 1v1 every year since 2016
5:20 flight doing a normal floater without hook shot
cancel flight this aint entertainment
Flight is like an person you can bs around and not take him seriously lmao 😂
Nice
1v1 me cash.  I’ll pay you 5k if you win. I’ll teach you a few things about hooping
1st clip was a double😭😭😂😂
Hefty vs Glad. Who will win.
I would put A LOT of money on myself to beat either of these guys 😂
That nigga pockets out Bc his shot broke
They tired after the first 2 minutes of the game 😂😂
Hes honestly improving in a slow way.
7:23 needs an explanation 🤨
Trashketball at its finest
Flight gotta stop playing basketball
Flight should never be allowed to touch a basketball in public. His jumper is enough to scare children or break windows.
This man flight said the rim was only 9’9😂
it’s the shoes for me
Bad basketball lol
That’s carrry in the very first clip
Get well kris
All the bricks 🧱 I seen you could build another addition to your house cash 🤣🤣🤣
Thought cash was advertising bud for a sec
Flight needs to use his height as an advantage bruh
2 BOT
I don’t think there is anyone in the world that is as bad at basketball as these 2 🤣🤣
Yo, flight looks like starting to get it a lil bit tho
This is the worst game i done saw😂😂😂
Flight ate the cap cap fruit from one piece
Cant wait for cash to react to flight reacting to cash reacting
Flight the Goat… he actually makes every shot that he don’t miss!! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
They covid rusty, Did that man just say Newapoortic hahah

Who house is this ?
😂😂😂😂
flight ss irl
REPENT AND BE BAPTISED IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON AND SPIRIT. PLEASE JESUS CHRIST IS COMING, REPENT AND BE SAVED!!!! I PRAY THAT EVERYONE READING THIS MAY GO TO HEAVEN!
7:22 BRO How TH you gonna call a travel right there Cash?? You clearly don't know basketball lmao. If anything you could have TRIED to call a double dribble. But that would have been a reach also because he was taking the ball out lol
Both these dudes dumpster juice lol
Flight shoots with his elbows
Flight plays with his pockets out…. Gotta name for people like that out here
Bro has Flight won ONE 1v1 yet 🤣
WE LIKES THIS
Flights go better at dribbling no cap 😤😤😤
Cash really isn’t good at basketball
How is that they never get better
🔥🔥
Y’all niggas breathing hard asf 😂
that was hard too watch
Cash you got something in your hair stuck and it pisses me off take it out
Flights handles could use some WD-40 but overall descent
🔥
Flight has to be the worst basketball player on YouTube
If anything it would be double dribble😂
I don’t even have to watch the whole video to know who wins 😭
It’s always good to see a good 1v1 with Cash and Flight!!
Both their shot percentages were under 10% lol
he stay wit the excuses
7:22 its called a double dribble not a travel and no he's good cash
cash look like a legit mycareer player
9:21 holy shit you cooked this man like bbq chicken
It's amazing how bad these guys are and it still had over a half million views...
Flight still one of my favorite YouTubers tho
worst 1v1 ever documented 😩💀
If I stayed in Cali I would 1v1 flight
We need another flight and cash team up
I gotta see flight vs swae lee
Cash but not adin..
What an excuser flight is
F light ball not cash
I  want flight two win and make a come back
Flight ball handling looking better
flight crossover man, it somehow worksss sometimes
We need a cash and ash update no cap
The match we all been waiting for
Both y'all will get waxed by me.
Bro I would honestly win against both of y’all like it’s nothing y’all wouldn’t even score more then 2pts
Cash played with his food....
Flight gets worse every year but we still love him
stop capping you don't use roman, You can't finesse a finesser 🤦🏾‍♂️
There goes them bricklayers again
My man cash looking like drue holiday with them step backs God dammmmn 💥
That was a travel
Bro why does he always have his pockets out like that. That shit not clean
Flight just Throws it up and hope bc he can’t drive
bro cash u litt double dribbled at the start
Coulda named it building a house with flight with all those bricks
Both these guys play way too much 2k and think they can actually hoop.
ad starts at 2:59 & ends at 3:58
First clip wasn’t a double
I see great potential on flight
Cash is straight up built like draymond green 💀😂
BALL IS LIFE.⛹‍♂️
Them grinches lookin cold
🤡 fest
Loving your content ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️
I'm not taking any hooping channel seriously if their taking Flight seriously,
That boy with the white tee is the trashes brotha I’ve ever seen
anyone else notice flight carries on every single dribble
I like how at tha end of tha day is all love🖤‼️
God is good .
Well safe to say we all kno when cash reading a promo 🤣🤣💀🤦🏽‍♂️
Love the content but man both of you can’t hoop. Cash more of chance then flight, flight turrible
I want Carlos vs Flight . That would be hilarious 1v1
BALL IS LIFE.⛹‍♂️
Cash bring da ball back😭😭
Cash you are a cry baby
8:50 WET LIKE WATER
Take shot every time they miss a 3, you’d have liver failure by the end of the video.
3:51 worst fit in existence..
4:24 good move flight use that more when u get more consistent with ur threes
WTH is that peanut butter plaid shoulder cut bottom up?!!!!!!
7:23 “that’s a bullshit callllll”  Burt Reynolds voice 🗣
BALL IS LIFE.⛹‍♂️
9:23 what was that cash?
This was hard to watch, from both of them. Looks like they just started playing 3 months ago.
Love this
this is brick fest
Damn cash how u start the video wit a double dribble
i swear flight has the right ideas but physically cannot execute 😂😂😂
CashNasty kinda plays like Harden
Cash tried hiding that hairline but fuckkk you could still see it from close up 😂💀😩
Winded for a 15 min game
Спасибо автор
7:17 u called travel.... That's p*ssy ish 😂😂😂😂
If I was a betting man I'd lose I rooted for  flight 😔
5:07 ayo that sound effect killed me 😂😂😂
I was surprised when I seen flight do what he did at 4:24 but missed 🥲
This is the Worst thing ive ever watched 😹😹 For a Second I thought they were pretending to be this Awful at Basketball
Does travel mean double dribble where cash from or am I tripping?.
Lmao Flight has to stop playing Basketball
Cash needs to stop doing that same rhythm step forward step back into 3 because better players will jump on that and pack him
I see flight still catching Ls.
Flight's trolling level is at an all time high
they did cash dirty with that art
That’s crazy flight actually that bad bruh he don’t care if he’s down a lot by half time u should be ashamed of yo self flight
Damn I thought cash was Chris sails on the thumbnail for some reason😂
Idk why flight keeps playing cash he ain’t ever beating him
Went down to read the comments and went back up and they at 2-0 tf
6:46 “Irish “ brick lmaoo
Flight suck
Jesus both are terrible 😅🤣
Come to Memphis and get the 1vs1
They need work they process the moves slow they be tryna play like 2k to much
Ayoo why flight got his pocket like that lmao if ykyk
When did Carlos get tattoos 😭
8:04 the most useless uro I have ever seen in my life both of em L’s
Both of you take the shoes off😐
Flight carries a lot
now i may of said this about a 2 years  ago this is how many 13 yr olds can beat flight in a 1v1, now its this is how many 15 yr olds can beat flight. skill went up with handles and his defense but his shooting is still floppy in the air and long shots feel like they didn't go anywhere if not worse.
Why the hell is youtube here
Easy travel
The sound affects tho 😂😂
2 ppl who cannot shoot, shooting 3’s the whole time😭
8:36 😤😤😤
This is tough to watch.  Definition of Trashketball.
Id drop cash off inna 1v1
Bro is flight actually trying ??? Bro taking stupid shots this ain’t 2k😂😂😂
Pick in ur hair while ur hooping?? I can dig it
Cash vs flight will never get old
Cash look buff not flexing xd
Cash ain’t bad but there’s no way he actually believes he’s a shooter.
Cash trending
Flights shots just needed to fall couple of em went in and out
Go to 7 next time
Hey cash what cobes are those
That travel call was petty 😂😭
Genuine question: do they try to Be this sorry on purpose?
High-key two of the sorriest hoopers I seen in a while 🤣 cool video tho
Cash hair don’t grow my boy 😂😂
“we can instant replay dat ik u gonna do it anyway” 😂😂😂😂
This is the most unskilled 1v1 I’ve ever seen
flight is terrible😂😂😂
God Damn Cash that play after half was jaw dropping dude you got alot better and flight is well flight xD
I'm not saying Flight is not bad at basketball its just he needs to work on his jump shot and get some drippling moves.
Had to get an easy dub after the nick fiasco 🤣🤣
Cash been working on the jump but let’s see cash 1 v 1 mal
Bring back the 2v2s you and flight
Boi u gotta drop dat top of da key merch
pure comedy, GOAT duo
Mans carried in the Intro💀
Aint no way flight is 6”3 how tall is he actually he looks maybe like a few cm taller than cash
Flight getting big tho no cap
In a short time, the video was seen by many. I envy you. I would also like more people to see my videos. How did you get to this level?
Cash stop taking Long 2’s 😂😂
I think it’s about time we get the Duke Dennis 1v1?? 🤔
Cash still lost to Ricegum though. Get that rematch now.
Cash Loki went crazy
Swish 🌬
Ben Simmons shooting 3’s
Goated.
It’s funny how cash says “wet like water” but goes 2/11 on 3’s😬
Wet like water!!!
But he wont vs adin ross
BALL IS LIFE.⛹‍♂️
This is like these dudes 8th time playing eachother
Flights character is perfect for him i don't care what people say about him lol
Halftime in pickup!?!? What in the world 😂😂

The sound effects whenever flight missed🤣
Boy flight be shooting prayers
Idk if these boys new the ball was suppose to go in the rim 🗑
YouTube commented 💀
They carry waaaaayyyy to much, the whole dam video
I found there are lots of sound effect back there
Is flight good? He driving away from the basket like he has 10 strength
One of the best duos in YouTube history
His foot was on da line when shooting for ball
For people that live and breathe the game of basketball they are both very uncoordinated and sloopy asf(flight just suck for real)
Why u look like James harden @:23
this shit hard to watch
Cash did improve a lot he hit way more shots now
this was much needed, flight was getting a lil bit too comfterable talking about cash in his reaction videos lol
Holy shit cash how fucking bad are you that you actually have to call a travel on fucking FLIGHT????????? and ur jump shot is garbage no cap that top of the key shit is all bs
7:27. U gonna call that? And that’s a double dribble nigga not a travel🤣😭🤣.
I don’t wanna stand up😂
cash hit a hooper hooper move and said nothing
Dudes got this whole court to themselves but play like straight DOODOO.
Them kobes 🔥
@7:39 cash tryna finesse😭
7:35 Can somebody please tell me how the hell are you “not paying attention” if you’re literally recording the game?! Come on Kenny you’re not that slick baabeeyyy 🤣🙌🏽💯
Win doesn’t count the rim was a bit too high rematch
Cash this embarrassing how you gon let flight get 4 points fly me out ill skunk em ngl probably take you 11-5
What Kobe’s are those ?🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Only person cash can dog on court is flight get some real comp 😂🐱
Flights handles got better
@7:00 minutes in and barely 4 points scored.   Would rather watch a 15 second AD about your 1v1 then this shit.
Flight be attacking the rim like he got someone on his hip at all times 🤣
The rematch we all needed
I NEED MY 1v1 next 🔥👀
More than double digits ain’t halftime like 6 points or sumn lol these niggas smh
Flight got Mexican legs
Bro where is Ash haven’t heard or seen in her in a year.
First clip is such A DOUBLE DRIBBLE!!!!
Flight improving though
Honestly Cash needs to drive more he is clearly not a good shooter
Always good to see these 2 old heads 😅 Glad they don't got no bs beef or something
flight is a straight bum
Cash was 2/8 from the top of the key not counting the other missed three pointers that he had form other spots on the floor… it’s safe to say that cash is NOT A SHOOTER FOR SHIT LAMO Cash never say your a shooter bro honestly I’m sorry
🌊🌊🌊

He did do double dribble!!
4:08 and 4:29 was not out on cash
Flight really ain’t learn nun from June this is crazy
Flight petty for that
@7:20 cash Thts not a travel ball was not in play yall just checked it up why u tryna cheat flight
Bro I love watching Cash and Flight vids.  Between their 1v1s and reactions of reactions of reactions they gotta be the most entertaining duo on the internet.  Always delivering fire content!
It's not June 🗣️🤷🏾‍♂️
I been waiting for this lol
Nah

BALL IS LIFE.⛹‍♂️

Flight shot selection is horrible.

Flight 3 pointer is a d and cash is a b
Who else watches to see if flight will actually win
Wet like watta is better then Irish spring green
Flight x cash vs jesser moochie
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
Next time i wanna see a real flight June bro...
Yo that was travel hahahaha
All jokes aside. They both improving, great to see. Also cash, that hezi you did at baseline was not it bro lol.
Cash should shoot more 2s
🔥🔥🔥
If only he done him 12-1
My 7 year old nephew could beat flight 😂
He doubled
Anybody reading this keep grinding your almost there 💯
Flight the only n**ga i know who can train and get worse lmao
I wish flight would work on his inside game. This man has at least two inches over cash, you should be running this lil nigha over every single play. Cash been working on his shots , big improvement
Welp, looks like it’s time to play Dreyahh again...
Carlos vs Flight
Irish Spring Green🧼 x Wet Like Water💦 = TEAM CLEAN 😭😭🔥🔥💪🏾🐐
WET LIKE WATERRRR CUZZ!!!!💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
I could beat cash 1v1 11-0
why does flight run during his jump shot?
VÁ TOMAR NO CU. VAI ARRUMAR UM TRABALHO SEUS VAGABUNDOS.
only IRISH lol
Can we just talk about how cash is working on that step back!🔥 Great work my man respect was only a giannis type player now a Lebron type player🔥
Cash x flight = bron x Westbrook trynna hit a game winner next year
🔥🔥
Bro cash you shot 30% from three bro you can’t say you a shooter no more your just a shoot
pick cash different
Is it just me or does anybody else rock with cash's fro
Ima keep it a buck. Flight had a lot of in and out shots, I feel like this was one of his best games overall. If those shots ended up falling, would’ve been a more intense game. Still airballed but y’all get what I mean 😂
these guys are gonna have a new house built by the time this video is done w/ all those bricks they are throwing up.
man who has the basketball court in their backyard? i'm jealous..
I think top of the key is not your spot
If only flight can just hit his shots, he has great hustle but that jumper ain’t it. He would win more games and probably beat cash but who know 👀👀
Best duo on YouTube
We all know flight lost
🤣🤣🤣 good game but both of y’all  🗑 much love
flight can dribble now lmaooo
What exactly has flight been practicing? Cus it sure ain't the shots or handles. Dude is good for content tho!
Gotta love dis duo lmao
No cap flight shoes are 🔥
mans said travel you  mean double dribble lmao
No haircut cash going crazy💯
Both there videos are trending
What kobes did flight have on?
Y’all should do a challenge atta this
good game
Flight shot a crisp 3/19 FG% 👀💀
Cash was going crazy ‼️
Bruh flight really letting me down 😔
2:40 they said "we gon back to back"
Cash went 4/15 from the 3
This man really put a commercial during flights hook shot knowing that shit was going to miss
Am I the only one who witness cash travel on the last bucket 😂
Green sayings CHICKEN NOODLE KRABBY PATTY I'M TRAE YOUNG YAAAAAAAAAA
Imagine cash anxiety during games with flight because if he ever lose his career is over lol
That travel in the first clip tho😂 good game tho
Wet Like Water !
Flight had a couple that should’ve went in Ngl y’all should’ve played to 15
9:22-9:30 is Cash’s CLEANEST bucket ever.
Cash I will respectfully say u r still not a shooter good game tho😂
Flight shot good shots goal just 1inch to high how is he post to hit dat
Cash for all his practice still is, and likely will always be a terrible shooter...if Flight gets more confidence, he’s gonna be a problem shooting on the outside. His form and release is better than Cash’s
Flight trass asf 😂😂
How many times have they 1v1’d each other and cash has won
I think at this point flight just gotta play the people that’s commenting 😂😂😂😂💯
Flight gets ran by Cash EVERYYYYTIME 😂😂😂😂😂😂
do a 2v2 ricegum and adin vs cash and flight
Flight's form is not really the best if he fixed it he would be more consistence and better at shooting
Imagine calling travel in a 1v1 come on now
BALL IS LIFE.🏀⛹🏽‍♂️
Ooouu dat whole sequence for 10 was nasty‼️😤 i luv seein u progress like dat💯
Cashes travel at 9:25
Time to smoke
Why does cashes picture look way off
" what it do flight crew ftc flight team stand UPPPPP Ftc the strongest its finally AUGUST
In my years of watching both play ball, I’m just here appreciating how far they’ve come. They both still sorry though
flights swears he going to the nba every year
Cash:Irish spring brick!!
I think if flight called cash out in the beginning it was fair to call the travel
Jesser you should wash your court damnn😳😳😂
dirt on the camera lens 😩
Watching this video : -_-      Watching YRG react to this video :  : )
Flight doesn't even follow his shot when he shoots 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
Flight breathing hard// the flight conditioning is real

Question why does cash keeps playing flight when you know flight is a walking bum/scrub smfh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Flight all you gotta do is take it to the whole back him down and use your body you got the height on him dude
Cash tryna look like denzel Washington in “for the love of the game” or sum shit like that🤣🤣
U Possed To Do Him Worse Den Chris Did U 😂
I think all YouTube 1v1's should only go by 1's... specifically because the games are hella predictable... they all just try to take as many 3's as possible and the the game is over after 6 or 7 makes.
Tired of seeing u play flight tbh ..
cash think about getting dreads
Cash wanna call double dribble my boi you could’ve hit flight with a “carry” EVERY PLAY!!!
8:05 who was cash Eurostepping ?

4:24 watch that in 0.25x 😂😂👌👌
Flight the only person ik to start the game 0-10😭😭
I know Cash a Bron fan, but he plays like Kawhi XD. Evem his shot looks the same
Kenny is such a good Camera man tho fr
I’m watching the rivalry between Lebron and Steph again after 13 months.
Flight let u win 😂jokes

#✈️ 💀✈️💀✈️💀✈️💀✈️
They hate each other but both are sorry, airballs are just inexcusable, flight should have never played in enemy territory, he should have had some of his fans around.
HAHA NC ONE FLIGHT HAHAHA
If Bron get away with travel flight get away travel kings make their own rules
Cash grow out the Afro cut my boi
Flight is 🗑
Flight is the type of dude to drink a energy drink after the match💀
Why was a house building video on my recommended
Yea cash a 1v1 2v2 guy. He ain't shit in 5v5 tho 🤣
That is a great video to do in life right know today
Stop shooting!For both
Flight is still a better rapper than gento
Cash reminds me of jrue holiday
Good defense an hustle towards the end of the game flight 🔥🔥play d like that you winning every game
That boy cash 3for10 Three-point percentage

I likes watching ads on this channel for CASH to pay the bills
9:26 travel to Mars
Cash the 🐐
BILLS GETTIN PAID!!!
No lie I think Flight actually put on a bit of size.
Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He was buried and rose again on the third day
The rerererererererererererererematch
He double dribble
flight is actually the worst 3 point shooter ive ever seen
Flights release is as bad as his release in 2k…someone hacked him and changed his sliders
Bro it ain’t June no more that’s an advantage for you cash and you know that 😂
It’s honestly fascinating how little flights game has developed despite how much he is around the sport of basketball. Like he is unfathomably bad and still manages to look like someone who’s hardly ever picked up a ball even tho he's made hundreds of IRL videos and watches games and stuff. Like you wouldn’t expect him to be good but you’d think there would be SOME improvement at least by now.
Cash Nasty WET LIKE WATER
Cash always had a pretty good left hand
Damn. Cash tried to finesse flight on a travel but got outsmarted by flight himself. Props to flight bro! 💪🏽
I already know imma watch this like 5 times
Bro is flight actually that bad?
Aye cash great game not hating just listing percentage you went 30% /4/13 3FG ( 3 point field goal ) 66.6% / 4/6 FG (Field goal) great game cash but let’s be real y’all it was no challenge for cash dud could have went 6/6 look cash will be the goat and always the goat we know top of the key is wet like wata
Love this

Cash looks like a teletubby with that thing 😭
Cash follow through shot looking better…keep it up cash💯
Cash got the +5 Grinches on. 😂😂😂
2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. (‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭43‬‬:‭2‬ KJV)
Flight didn’t look bad, just missed a lot
Bro flight broke character at the end when him and Cash boyed up he laughted after all the excuses

But Im pretty sure y’all live somewhere else I would even be able to do it
Shit at this point I want to 1v1 cash and and flight 🙏🏼
7:18 cash you can’t finesse a finesser 😂😂
Lowkey, that travel call that cash try to do made me mad. Like you have the overall advantage and you’re wining .
All that dribble training just to dribble like a Walmart brand Gio Wise
Flight didn’t dribble as in play he dribble the ball towards him for he can grab it

That hoop isnt regulation man too tall
Who won the last time

You have to retire from playing flight
It would’ve been a double dribble not a travel 🤓
Now they both gonna react eachother for like 3 different videos
Still can’t play adin tho
you cheated him the rim was too low
cash why u tryna turn around and walk of the court after shooting and saying "wet like water" like it's your 1st shot and it's not even close to the final game ending shot c'mon man u just making yourself look dumb
Both of you been practicing 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Stay saying “ouuu” when flight dribble guy doesn’t even go anywhere with his dribble 😂😂
B4 I watch u better win wit dem kobes on...I'll comment again after the video

At 7:20ish when you called that travel that’s slick a false call bc it would be double but he got it back anyway 😂
Flight is a 60 overall stretch big
The two of them would’ve built 4 houses with all those bricks
Over 200k in 7 hours sheesh gotta pay those bills cash
Cash has to use his size to his advantage. He almost always get shoots
I can beat both of y’all !!!
How many rematches y’all niggas gonna do
Flight shooting form be bad
That rim messed up flight like twice 😂
4:08 I love that zoom in edit my boa

if cash had any type of ACTUAL bball iq hed win 30-0😭 stop shooting lmfao
9:22 this nigga cash was in the Duffey 👀😤
Flight said “you were 20%” 😂😂😂 he never give props
Believe in JESUS, we are all sinners deserving the wrath of GOD, because we sin against a holy and just and perfect GOD. Therefore we all deserve the punishment hell, but GOD in his rich grace and mercy by which he loved us sent JESUS to die  for us on the cross to leave  his throne and suffer for us. To  be the perfect  sacrifice for us because he  himself was sinless and perfect. That  if we would have a repentant heart and believe in JESUS and place our faith in Him, we will be saved from the eternal punishment which is hell, and be given eternal life.

First game to 16 second game to 13 I will personal fly myself Down there for this 1v1
When your name is flight but u can’t dunk 😂
flight won in my opinion
8:02 Euro for no reason.
I gurantee you b4 I watch after 2 minutes the pick fall out once minimum.
Cash really said y’all not skipping my AD TODAY
What kris talking about? Your foot wasn’t even on the line @8:48
I already know the outcome of this vid without watching,, but I want to help cash pay his bills
How does flight have a basketball channel with subscribers? He is not physical enough, and it is evident his cardio is poor. Good job Cash.
9:12 wtf he sayyyyyyyyyy😂😂
im not tryna be that guy but cash go from heel to toe every time he pivots
All’s imma say is you weren’t playing like that agains super cuts 👀👀
lolol the first shot flight takes *air ball  Flight : "fuck!"  i knew it was over
fireee
He said halftime I usually be down double digits… but halftime start when the first player gets to 8…. 😂😂😂
4/14 from three= wet like wataa
I like dis💪🏾🏀
Cash: ima get a haircut Friday Me: Today is Friday
We need more
I'm better than the both of yall.
Flight needs to get on a shooting gun
I’m convinced flights training makes him worse
You can alway count on the friends watching to hit you with the “idk I wasn’t paying attention”
Cashnasty literally check the ball up then flight just picked up the ball and  cash  tried to call that a travel dumbest thing I've ever seen cash do
Flight vs Carlos???
Ayeee
Gotta love Flight’s confidence 😭😭
Wet like water x Irish Spring Green!
More bricks than a prison.
The Kobe’s outside is illegal
I recall Cash beating Flight with a hand tied behind his back. This matchup has no meaning any more after that.
cash get that pick outta your hair 😂
7:19 ima have to take Flight side on this one LMAO
These edits got me rollin
Wow wonder who’s gonna win this one 😐
Pick in the hair whole time look dumb
Ayyyy flight still ducking adin we need that 1v1

Flight lowkey played good he just couldn’t score
Yeah it was the rim. 100%
Flight 🌲
cash its called a double dribble lmao not a travel
2hype vs nick briz rematch is what we need
Flight has no jumper and has no Handles
Cash really called game like 4 or 5 times before it was actually game🤧
How many misses we gonna see from both sides?
9:24 that’s called the cash money hesi if you watched cash enough any time he does that move muscle memory kicks in when he does the behind the back then slows down the left hesi he normally hits that step back three that’s his patented move and I realized oh that’s going In just off seeing him get to that move it’s like his highest percentage move cuz it’s a setup for muscle memory and it aligns him
at 9:22 was that a Hesi bc that looked like a double dribble
flight has gotten better i can see it . but that jumpshot 😂😂😂👎🏾
The first 6 minutes looked like a shoot around after a 6am workout
who let cash wear them grinches on an outdoor court😪
Hi
Dam cash you brought out your best moves in this game plz keep that same energy I’m on your side cash
Hi
u gotta admire the fact that flight doesn’t quit

Gotta love flight ✈️ Idc what anybody say 😂😂 Irish spreen green greeen
If we are playing by the rules then everytime flight dribbles it is a carry
i see you cash paying them bills with that sponsor 😂😂
I gotta give to flight man the guy is not nearly as rough as he used to be, still not the cleanest ball I’ve seen but he ain’t looking like a deer flailing around anymore
Double dribble
Cash really finessing paying bills with that sponsorship 😂💀
Flight look like he Been hitting the gym

Cash try Harding with the calls
Can't wait to see cash beat flight once again
Cash that step back move was nice and hit the three wet like watttaaa

Flights stats vs Cash Points: 4   Rebounds: 12   Airballs: 4 FG: 3-22 (13%) 3PT: 1-12 (8%)

No matter how many times they play against each other cash is always gonna win flight just doesn’t get better
"The rim was 0.1 inches too high" was what got me 🤣🤣🤨
Anyone else think the more flight trains the worse he gets?
Kenny gotta stop sayin "shEeEesH"
Hof rebound chaser - flight
Why is Flight actually doing not bad wtfff

Damn cash destroyed him
Calls a travel then gives the definition of a double dribble lol
Cash didn’t even try on defense cash the goat he will never lose to flight ever 🔥

the day flight wins against cash, the world will be purified
Flight got his Menace to society badge on HOF
tbh flight wouldve had hella points but he kept hitting the rim and getting in and out the rim
Cash getting hyped playing flight😂
