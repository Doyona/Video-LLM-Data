Cried my eyes out whenever you have your moments with your nan. I've never had a close relationship with mine as they lived in another country and now both my mum and dad's parents have passed away over the last 5 years. Hope your Nan can live a long and healthy life to see you grow into a wonderful woman and one day a mother too 💚
I love your videos.  What's your moms youtube channel name?
You and your nanny are just the absolute sweetest people I have seen 😢😩🥰
Atticus is growing up so fast.. he is growing more mature by the day
