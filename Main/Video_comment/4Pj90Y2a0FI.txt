Keep it up and all the best for you career Ben!

Why a part 2 😭
Scenes!!!!!!!!!
2:49 what's that?
Brilliant!!! Congrats to The Hornets. Honestly, Ben, your videos have really encouraged a lot of fans of other clubs to become a little invested in Watford. I deffo have a soft-spot now, and as a United fan I never have had a ‘second team’. If we hadn’t withdrawn from the Super League I was set to become a full-time Watford fan!! 😂. Can’t WAIT to see the premier league content as well as all the regular cycling bits and bobs. Awesome work.. love your positivity. You must be a great person to have around the dressing room, which is probably why you’ve had such a long and successful career.
Class
