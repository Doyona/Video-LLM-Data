Hi gabrella
@4:57 OMG
I always take a B3 Niacin Shake during a pregnancy scare.
I miss baby boo Collin.
I love watching twining out
RACHEL IS RAGGING TOXIC
Ok but seriously they need to drop Rachel!
Jwoww at 13:32?
I thought gabi with her chubby cheeks was so adorable I am sad she got hate for that. You could tell it was health related 100%
I hope the niki and gabi channel never dies 😞😞
Yasss ! So would love to season 2 ! It wa a just sooo good ! ✨🤍💫 & omg niki your album was so good hope you keep doing music & you truly keep killing it your amazing at it all love ! 🪴🖤💗
Is it just me or are they starting to look so much alike again???
9:20 that laugh was so unnecessarily extra😭
i really used to love u guys.... but umm shit is just plain weird now wow so yea 💀
It's Niki's full lips and BRUNETTE hair for me (hairdresser) xoxoox 💖💖
Wish they would react to Luke Alexander watching their show. He made some really good points
Bet Niki and Collin have been messing around too💀
I thought you looked beautiful!!
Hi Niki and Gabi I love the game I piay it all the time
I’m about to die.
I’m about to die.
I’m about to die.
Arfan ali
Let her do a family channel and her music
Gavin always looks so u comfortable and it makes me sad 😢
okay but can we talk about how Nate deserves better
My question is, is Gabi bisexual as well? Or was she just curious when she chose to hookup with Rachel?
Wait y’all both bisexual or lesbian?
@iamtherohan
I LOVEEEEE HOW THEIR DYNAMIC NOW IS 😭❤️
When your not  allowed to have Snapchat☹️
Why is she now blaming her face on steroids when she has admitted it's from plastic surgery?
If you guys love that game you def should try Covet Fashion!!
I love Gabi's eyebrows
Yall are AMAZING
Please do more Challnege videos!!!
I feel like for the first time you guys actually look like twins 😘
i feel like niki wants to keep up with the tiktok trending looks
I am not trying to be rude/send hate but it feels like niki is being to selfish
BRO I HAVE THAT GAME  I GOT IT LIKE 4 months ago
The show was more annoying to watch on Snapchat.... I prefer when it’s on YouTube
Y’all should make outfits on the app and then try and recreate those outfits in real life
omg thank you i love pocket stiller
Nikki I love your hair that color 😍you're so beautiful and talented!
Pls buy from shein and do a haul
Did niki come back from l.a?
i love pocket styler!!
What’s yalls pocket styler user names?
Glad to see Nikki with her beautiful brown hair. Love Gabi's beautiful blonde hair.
YASS we need a season 2
Is there going to be a season 2? If so when
OMG I love and live for your hair style in this Nikki...
Are you guys having a giveaway soon? Btw, love your vids 💕
Very cool video!
I play pocket style
Love you ladies
NOBODY is talking about how fcked up it was for gabi to basically tell niki that if she moved SHE’LL MAKE IT A FAMILY CHANNEL FOR HERSELF. 😤 LiKeEe wtf that doesn’t give Gabi the right to make a decision, it’s a SHARED channel!!!!!! That’s on periodt 😌
NICKIS HAIRSTYLE IS SO CUTE, SO EDGY ITS GIVING SELENA QUINTANILLA/POPSTAR. U BOTH ARE GLOWING. 🤍
ok so what if you did a mary-kate & ashley inspired video? niki could be mk & gabi could be ash - new york minute vibes????
Love this video perfect
What do you think mannn
🙂
What do you think about this?
Subscribe to Bolt Gamer
Got it!!
Gabi looked identical to Alex when she was wearing that Fendi headband
ONGGGGG YEEESSSSS
Ive been playing pocket styler and never knew it was played by my favorite youtuber 💖💜💙
Is there any other way I can watch this without Snapchat?
Okie but the air quotes around “chemical pregnancy” 😒😒
Why tweet snap chat??? Why not get a Netflix series???
my sister loves you guys
You should let your camera man/ girl pick your outfits
I'm begging you to do a video 9f your first time horse riding , if you haven't  rode a horse yet. If you have the do oneof riding horses again
nice
OMG A NEW REALITY
You should make a p o box
HOW AM I OOOOONLY JUST SEEING THIS?!
OMG YESSSS i’m so excited for the birthday trip show!!!!!
Start recording S2 !
It is good to see your growth, good for you guys
Pocket styler is really similar to Covet I’m curious to know which one people like better. I’ve personally been playing Covet for years 💖
Collin and Nate be like, these 2 r crazy
2:25 is when it starts
Where can u watch the show??
So Gabi is bi too? I would love a video on this
Niki looks so pretty
Nate’s only job is Niki’s cameraman????
i got a weird feeling with rachel joining in putting herself all up on nate 😀
Niki I just wanna say this is the best your hair has looked, the bangs look so cool and edgy!!!
Gosh that’s embarrassing
Reality tv-shows are kinda fake lol. It's the only way to make the show interesting. They have to create drama to keep interested/invested in watching. I really like their challenges, advice, tutorials and vlogs more.
the show felt fake. sorry 😐
is the show on snapchat for free?
IG: @suri_almeida
It amazes me how much these girls look like Billy Joel!!! Does anyone else see it?
THANKS FOR THE VID GIRLS LOVE YOU BOTH.... I SEE YOU NIKI🥰😍😘
It was your choice to talk about sex on the internet and since you knew your family is watching your videos why are you surprised?
Well said 💋
These Guys should do a Podcast!

What if you did a my parents react to our videos/socials 😱 might not be the best idea but good content lol
I’ve been watching your YouTube channel since 2017!!
I didnt really like the snapchat show because the episodes were about different things everytime and the episodes were so short I personally like the youtube show
Why does Niki look so FIRE in this vid
It's unfortunate to me that societal beauty standards are so high that women feel like they need to explain why they look a certain way to negative people/commenters. You both are beauty in your own special ways, we are so excited for what's to come with both your individual careers and the N&G channel💖
I really hope your friends aren't fake.
Niki being Bratz ✨💜 and Gabby being Barbie💖💓
Nikki looks stunning!
💙✨
Can could already imagine how gabi will be a great mother ❤️
Cringin hell
The editing on this video is amazinggg, actually loved this video
“Me and Rachel” 😂   “Rachel and I” is correct English, you illiterates.
omg i didn't know nate kissed rachel in the shoot im dying lol i wish i had a friendship and relationship like that. my bf wouldn't want me to kiss a girl ugh
Plastic surgery
https://youtube.com/shorts/L0GLI4ZNJ7c?feature=share
I am watching niki and gabi since the begging. I had crazy panic attacks back then and they made feel like myself
👉https://youtu.be/2IkoKhr6Tss
ka nyanyi genjer genjer
We want a Niki & Gabi Podcast!!!
Not Colin railing her 😂😂😂 I love how they grew up and talk about adult things now
what drove me craziest in the show was that Nate never actually said he would go to LA with her, he said they would "have that conversation then" as in decide when it comes down to it. But she spent the entire show saying he agreed to go with her 😂
Wow Rachel getting them both
Niki and gabi take the jersey shore
Omgg I loveee the new concept for the chanel
Gabi:The snap story will entertain you this summer Me:lol I live in Australia and it’s 15 degrees
Gabi looked soo much cuter in the reality show , love her both ways❤️
Tbh I didn’t even notice you guys took a break 😅 but glad you healed from it!
Ngl I like the snap stories cuz u guys feel safe with the producers but i liked the series on YouTube before , gonna miss that :/
At 15:15 when Gabi said “You see what you can change physically and emotionally” it broke my heart cause you can see the hurt in her face…
Only 1k left till 10mill 😍😍😍 Congratulations 🎊
I literally had to rewind the first few seconds over about three times to make sure I heard correctly lol
Do we get a second season? You guys look so much happier now🤍💜
WAIT WHAT ABOUT GABI'S NETFLIX SERIES. WHAT'S HAPPENING?!??
Wait so Niki, Nate and Rachel are all dating each other? I’m confused can some one explain or are they a thurplet?
https://youtu.be/10Mq9HNUUlg
I was on prednisone for my ovarian cyst. Mine had reverse side effects and I was more irritable and was constantly sweating
"Literally" doesn't mean what you think it means.
Awww yay I’m happy for you guys!
You didn’t have to be excited for her and her pregnancy but you should have been supportive.
THE WAY IT ALREADY BEGINS WITH THE HOOKUP STORY
Omg Gabbi Looks so cute with the Moon Face. I Love both looks.
IM ON PREDNISONE right now gabi i fucking feel you, everyones too quick to judge
Her finding the engagement ring is the fakest thing I’ve ever seen. Like wtfff. Are you joking? Do you think we’re dumb???
Spank bank
I was so confused about the proposal episode on the Snapchat show?? BC Gabi and Colin said on YouTube that she was sad one day, and he just took her to the ring store and told her to choose a ring and that’s how he proposed?? But on the Snapchat story it seemed like he already had the ring 💍

I love how much you both have evolved so much!
everytime I watch the niki gab reality show I cannot stand Niki, but some how in these videos she redeems herself
So happy for niki her new song is coming out at midnight and Demi posted WHATTTT!!!!!!!
Rachel thooooo ❣
I am so excited for the next videos!!
Nate is just my face 😂
I was binge watching your series 😍❤️ Gabi has always been my favourite.i love her relationship with Collin. They support each other. I'm obsessed 😩🔥🧡
wait im so confused niki is dating both Nate and Rachael
Where will the snap series  be posted?
Niki is SO AMAZING! I love watching her thrive 💗
Niki please go back to your red hair I loved it pleaseeee
I LOVE U GUYS SO MUCH BUT I ALSO MISS THE OLD U PLEASE DO MORE CHALLENGES SOON🥰🥰
I felt like the season wasn’t long enough. Like 9 episodes wasn’t enough 😩
fingers are crossed for a season 2 because lord knows i need it 😂🙏🏽🤞🏽
Definitely a season 2 but as long as there is a follow up video like this for season 2
Niki would make the perfect aunt!!!! 😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg I totally love that Gabon finally upgraded her camera and she’s found her passion again I used to watch her videos a lot and recently I started watching again and there was just a major change but I totally loved it
Niki plz go back to red hair we really miss it and Niki rocks in red hair......
this was so nice to see 🥺 you both have grown so much in your own way but together 🤍
why did nate kiss rachel
Niki looks exactly like Leah Remini rn 👀
FINALLY YOU GUYS MADE A REALITY SERIES ON YOUR OWN CHANNEL!!!!!!
THE WAY IT ALREADY BEGINS WITH THE HOOKUP STORY
it was entertaining , just soooo much talk about nikis  music music music and nothing else every episode . it was the whole season. I understand the passion about it but it just got repetitive .
Nikki looks gorgeous 😍😍😍😍
Yall have grown so much
anyone else shook to see jwoww????
I’m obsessed with twinning out!!! My new favourite thing
Rachel is... something
U guys will hit 10 mil btw
What do I search to watch it???
Will we never be able to watch it on YouTube
Such a fake show.
I’m glad you stopped stressing about LA so much, it was driving me crazy in the show. LA is not the only major hub for the music industry and when you live SO close to NYC, another music industry hub, why wouldn’t you give that a try first. New York’s music scene is booming, it’s way more your vibe PLUS you wouldn’t be far from PA. LA is not the only place to be. And this is coming from someone who works in the music industry.
I love u guys😭🥺💓
WE LOVE LONGGGG VIDEOS!! Love ya 💕
It made me so sad when Gabi said, “You see what you can change physically and emotionally.” ❤️❤️ ily Gabi and ur so beautiful and such an inspiration
You can literally SEE how much closer you girls are to each other in your relationship, just by the fact that there isn't a giant rift between you two when you sit next to each other. I can also see in your eyes the care for each other when you look at the other when she talks. It's refreshing to see that and please, if you need a break, TAKE A BREAK. It's so important. Much love!
I allready have it so fun lol
They both look so fcking goooodddd
I love how well edited this video was. Really liked how you addressed all the Qs I had when I watched the series. Loved the series and your glow up is goals ❤❤
Dang they were so toxic, i hope they're healthy now 💜
Yes  season 2 like it's literally so fun to watch twinning out❤
PETITION FOR NIKI AND GABI TO START A PODCAST

Oml I literally just downloaded that game last week 🤭
Omg yes the different is so there❤️❤️❤️Love you guys!!❤️❤️❤️😘
So they not gonna talk about the Netflix thing Gabi kept talking about during the snap show?

They both are glowing and look stunning as always
THE TEAAAA i gotta sit down for this
It’s the glow up for me!
I enjoyed this video
Ig: ari_g23♑️ nikiandgabicomebackzoom
my insta handle: nikki_chong_  🤍🤍
GABI HAD SUCH A GOOD GLOW UP OMGGGGGGG
Prednisone really saved me once!!! Fluid in my ears. Couldn’t stand without the room spinning!! But it helped me so much!
Niki and gabi: we’re gonna go to the Jersey shore   Fans: omg I live in New Jersey to when are you going and what day
I’M SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT NIKI AND GABI VIDEO!!!
This makes so much sense! Hope season 2 comes soon?❤️
Thank you so much for making this video! I needed the answerssss, i was so excited to what would happen in the next episode
Nikki and Gabby are awesome
wait i've missed alot are nate, niki and, rachel in a polyamorous relationship??
Plss because that is not the real reason you liars took a break
Not gabi didn’t talk about her Netflix show hmmmmmmmm
Congrats on the show!!
loved the snap series
Hey Nikki&Gabbi whasha up.Hey Hey.👭
How could you have ever called yourself a Christian Gabi, and then represent Christ in those vile ways?
They are both so pretty and they are so kind💖
Lmao I litterally said “that’s just nates face “ before he did it. I ment thats just how he is lol
in this u could tell gabi is way more mature like niki if u want to move to la then why not move and not make everything a bigger deal
not everyone needs to move to la to be successful
Oh my goodness you guys seriously are glowing!!! I loved this series and loved how honest you guys were in this video! I’ll support absolutely anything you two do I always will and always have since I started watching 4 years ago! I love you guys and this video!! I have just one question, you said something about how you felt about Rachel “at that time” does this mean you guys drifted?
niki hair extensions 😅😅
Twinning out was so good and I hope there will be more seasons. ❤️❤️
nonstop talking ab niki saying music career
I love u both but niki was very annoying on the series constantly going on about one thing or another
Same I like that game so much
Love the longer videos
this definetely cleared a lot up. thanks for being honest 😊 it's nice to see your relationship is better. I see as difference
OBSESSED WITH NICKI AND GABI
Love nikis hair
I would love for them to make a podcast and just spill all the tea on their lives!!
Omg love this so much
I wanted to know what was going to happen with Gabi’s Netflix show
Love u guys but the show wasn’t really good. This video is better than the show
Why can I not find it on Snapchat what do I do to find it on Snapchat
15:19 I luv how Nikki reminded gabi not to let haters mess up your mental state or anything  I love their new relationship💜
Niki I love your look today queen! You look hot!
You both seem so much happier lately! I feel like you girls have found yourselves and truly working on living your life for you & being happy n in the moment🥺 its so nice to see both flourishing! I cannot wait to see what the channel has to offer next 👏🏼💗💙

What's the update on the Netflix show?
I feel like you guys are both in such a better place. You both look the happiest you've ever been in this video. Keep thriving. 🎉🎉
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHY THEY STOPPED WITH THE AWESOMENESSTV SHOW AND DID A SNAPCHAT SHOW!
Gabi.. did I miss the jwoww hang out?! When did that happen?
Yayayaya another video
Yes love this
I really liked niki's hair in the snapshat show 😩
SEASON 2!!!!!
“Gabi had a threesome!?”
I did not just download that app… yeah I did
GABI DO NOT CHANGE A THING YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE THAT ANYMORE AND EVEN IF YOU DID YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL!!
So what would gabi’s sexuality be if her and Rachel hooked up will Collin was Railing her ? Or was it just an experience/ for fun?
Can Gabi please answer if she got the Netflix deal or not 😁😁
It is the Find myself After the big break for me😁🥰
wait but gabi's "moon face" is still pretty she is just overall really pretty
I- it started so quickly 😭😭
9:20 “uncomfortable looking” ahahaha same Nate
Yay kinda early
your relationship has so clearly grown so much, glad you took the break 🤍
I thought you looked beautiful

Hi niki and gabi
God bless you both for including us in your growth. We're all along this ride with you, I'm 26 next month and love growing up with you and laughing at literally age appropriate shit, convos I have in my head spoken out loud with you on your YouTube. I am so grateful. I know you both have good hearts and shit sometimes just does happen to challenge us. But I love watching your content shift and grow and feeling like I somehow know you guys because you do knock down a wall other content creators hide behind to look and seem perfect? Idk but tysm
love,love,love
It’s the both glow up after the Snapchat show for me 💫💜
Love you niki and gabi you both always look stunning
Season 2 please!
They both looked spoiled
i’m living for the ‘crazy, kinda hippie, eccentric’ auntie Nikki vibe 💖💖
I LOVE THE SHOW! and it’s okay to always take a break from here!💗
I download that game as a joek, and now i’m adicted to it :)
I just downloaded pocket styler yesterday and now y’all are talking about it today! Weird coincidence!
Loved this! You are incredible women 💛✨
I love ❤️ Pocket styler
You girls have grown so much and I'm so proud! 🌈😍✌️
Those bangs girl 🔥🔥
Niki you look like your mom
I love your guy’s content now!!! will you ever bring back the twins try series???
Kardashians🤷‍♀️
Hello I love y’all!!😃😄
When Niki was worried about moving to LA and that her fans won't be on board 🖐😭I'm just like sis WE WILL SUPPORT U GO!!!!
personally I hate how wlw relationships are always to please men - lesbian
That was really Interesting!
THEY NEED A NETFLIX SHOW PLSSS
How do you watch the series?Or episodes??
Why would Niki be okay w being in an open relationship? Tf is this
I feel like this was the one sponsorship that I didn't skip lol
i need to know what lipstick niki uses
She didnt address the netflix show...
It’s crazy how much your relationship changed and even shows throughout your videos. You both are considering each others feeling when you try to explain stuff, you wait until the other one finished a sentence and you look at each other while talking to the camera. That’s something I noticed since you came back. I can really tell that you both are in a better place now with each other. I’m happy for you!
Niki ur makeup looks better than ever, hair too!
where can i watch it
Idk why but it hurts every time niki says music is more important than YouTube
IM SO EXCITED FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY DOCUMENTARY!!!
This is better than the kardashians 😩
Why are like all questions to Niki? 😅
wait so are Niki and Gabi both bi sexual??
I LOVE Niki and gabi content.❤️
I love how they’re honest with us 🥺 love Niki and Gabi 💕
Wait a second. Did Gabi say Dumpledor? Lol
❤
YESSS oh my gosh I love you all!
The laugh at 9:21 was contagious! I laughed at Nate's remark, but the laugh made me laugh even harder lol.
Nikis hair look sickkkk
Niki looks STUNNING!
I love the snap chat series. I am glad to this video.
Gabi I saw that people were Tryna leak ur house bc u looked like ari are u ok
The way I cannot unsee Niki as Isabella from the Lizzie McGuire movie lmao
I loved the series, I want more episodes!
Early!
Yay I was waiting for this 🤩
✨QuEeN’s✨ <3
Niki, I loooove your brown hair!!! Love you girls so much. ❤️
Such a crummy day but your videos make it better watching nikis new one after this
Love you guys
After the birthday vids, you guys should do more videos with Alex!
me: "I was impatient and looked at Niki's dms on allday.Blue that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes
