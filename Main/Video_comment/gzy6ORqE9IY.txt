I wish btw for detective bank's ex wife should've been put in trap after cheating on her husband. She deserves to be terrified, and suffering major of pain. Like what bank's said "Women cheat, too. It hurts." People in life really ought to learn to appreciate their blessings, life and honestly, if they know what's good for them  "Those who don't appreciate life do not deserve life." John Kramer' words known as Jigsaw
This film is crack-a-lackin!
0:24 play me. 🙁
This was a really good movie
Excellent movie. Watch it
An abomination to the franchise.
This can currently be watched in Tubi.  Apparently, this movie wasn't promoted properly in spite of it being released during Covid. I read it didn't do well when it came out.  An actor like Samuel Jackson alone ... and with Chris Rock. The movie could have done better.   I was a little surprised to see Chris Rock in a movie like this one.  I could say more, but I'm not one to give spoilers.  I will say, ask this though: .... Have you ever wondered what  someone, or how many people it takes to come up so many horrifying details for movies like this? How many hours it took to come up?  I get that we all have an evil side, and the only difference is choice if we use the evil side or not ... To write something like this one has to tap into more than just a creative side, I assume.

Spiral from the book of saw is the cleverest and scariest movie in the world I love this movie it's my favorite movie
Honestly not a good movie. Lost the spirit of all the previous ones completely. way more of a crime movie than a horror one. The first saw got so popular because it was simple. this had way too much dialogue.
Never thought I’d see the day where Samuel L. Jackson is in a Saw trap. this is a crazy universe
I'll never forget the Transigsaw voice, my favorite!
This released on my birthday-
Before I started the film : " I bet Chris runs jokes like a stand up routine " ... 2 mins in he does the Jenny Gump joke. Turned it off and won't watch it again .
this was a masterpiece.
🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀
I'm a jigsaw fan Now don't get me wrong spiral was a good movie, it's just that the saw film series could/would start where last left off, except spiral, it was its own individual movie using jigsaw as a reference. Chris Rock was phenomenal!!! It just doesn't fit in the rhythm of the 10 film series. That's all I can say without ruining it with giving away too much info for those who haven't watched it yet  Jackson's roll really made the movie for me, it really cemented Rock's character
I can't take Chris seriously
i havent seen past saw 7 just finished it but seeing this made me think of the officer figg? who was obsessed w jigsaw + got his thrxat cut by john, this made me think how neat it wouldve been if this was based on his son or the child or anyone who lost a parent to jigsaw, considering the series is so centered arnd family + parenthood esp.
i can't take Marty from Madagascar serious
It’s like watching a drama with a talking zebra.
What a miserable actor!
that was rough lmao
0:41 that's the same kid laugh that they used on the FNaF teaser omg
This one is my fave in the Saw universe. Chris Rock was good in this.
Dumbest cop  movie ever its like watching KRK as Iron man in avengers 😂😂😂
Never even knew about these saw films.where av I been.😂
0:31 1:56
BaN AnTi SpIrAl
0:25 Play Me.
Anti spiral
horseshit
So it's a jigsaw copycat Who's following John Kramer's works why Doesn't he use the The original pig face mask
1:02
This one was crap I had to just fast forward to the end lol boring movie one of the worst.
“Keep my wife’s jigsaw out yo f****n mouth!”
Ending sucked, left me pissed off. I hope the people that made this movie are unalived.
Better than any Will Smith role he's ever done thus far. This move will be nominated at the Oscars. Chris Rock will stare at the camera as it slowly tightens up on him in the frame, while Will & evil wife watch with utmost animosity and envy !
After Chris Rock got smacked by Will Smith 2 years ago and he did nothing about it it will be hard to take Chris Rock seriously in this
a Saw / Seven mash up
The only saw movie that doesnt have any connection with john kramer... so disappointing
Man, this movie sucks.
Chris actually did an amazing job in a movie like this!! I would definitely love to see him in an actual slasher film with chase scenes etc.  Make a new halloween with the other story line with Danielle Harris and add chris rock!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is this new saw the lgbtq leader?
1:29
How come Chris Rock didn't realize that his partner was the kid that saw his dad get murdered?
IF THEY KILLED THE VILLAIN AT THE END WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME! CHRIS ROCK AND MARISOL NICHOLS OUTSTANDING
Пора говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, ЖИВОПИСЬ имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. СЛУЖИТЬ БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. "ПРИВОДИТЬ" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него.  МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое УПОМИНАНИЕ в этом фильме, и вообще везде, О БОГЕ ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), это обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО). НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ таких как ГОРДЫНЯ, ЛУКАВСТВО, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, и СТРАХ. И ВОТ ТАК, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ, ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» его рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И ЕЩЁ что КАСАЕТСЯ самого ФИЛЬМА. ПОКАЗАНО и опять же в виде насмешки, потому что мало зрителей понимает что реально происходит в фильме, ЧТО БУДЕТ ПРОИСХОДИТЬ С ЛЮДЬМИ В АДУ, но уже ПОСЛЕ ВТОРОГО ПРИШЕСТВИЯ ГОСПОДА нашего ИИСУСА ХРИСТА. Каждый будет получать от дьявола свой и всегда новый сюжет. Так что «в аду будет плачь и скрежет зубов». И при просмотре таких фильмов ЗАЩИТА тоже существует. ЕСЛИ СОГРЕШИЛ (даже только в мыслях, в данном случае почувствовал в своей душе проявление пороков записанных выше), надо сразу же ПРОИЗНОСИТЬ МОЛИТВУ ГОСПОДА нашего ИИСУСА ХРИСТА. «ГОСПОДИ ИИСУСЕ ХРИСТЕ СЫНЕ БОЖИЙ СПАСИ И ПОМИЛУЙ МЕНЯ ГРЕШНОГО». И ВОТ как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.  Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.  И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.  Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет "БОРОТЬСЯ" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА.   А ЧТОБЫ  "ПРИЙТИ" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.    Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, ВОЗМОЖНО даже примерно 8 МЕСЯЦЕВ, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ "шагом" будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻
Man i didn’t see that plottwist coming from a mile away
Bunun testereyle alakası yokkk
It was as if I was watching a snuff film. The deaths were too gruesome
Dreamcast 💪💪💪
is spiral any good
where is john cramer???😮
Whats that sound effect at 2:11
I like this movie. Dennis winship
Liked
If before 2021 you told me Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson were going to do a movie together, I'd have been super hyped. And then I would've seen this trailer and been confused and kind of disappointed.
sorry i loved this movie. the ending twist was predictable but i’m pretty sure that’s because they wanted the corruption of the police department to be the “real” twist and the real villains. i thought that part was well done. rock’s acting made it funny at times but it’s entertainment, i don’t have a problem with finding dramatic moments funny. SPIRAL 2 WHEN???
I don’t get how anyone actually liked this movie… this trailer does make it look promising but it completely sucked. I like Chris Rock as a comedian but his acting in this fell short. The traps were pretty good and the ending wasn’t bad but this did not have the same vibe of the other saw movies whatsoever.
Can tell from the trailer they have ruined a classic
2:04 dude blue himself
Good
Chris Rock should be embarrassed.  He did a good job in parts but the squinty eyes thing is pathetic. Trying to hard to look like a bada$$
Save some time dont watch this bullshit. Thank me later
Chris Rock is a Saw fan. Depending on how good this trailer is, will make the difference of whether I buy it or not.
I didn't see the point to this movie it's like someone brought the rights to the saw films and tried to make it based on the hood
Got to see this😮
I seen all the films Spiral is my favorite
Savage 21
Chris Rock going up against his ultimate nemesis...        *JIG SMITH*
this is one of the worst movies from the "Saw" franchies
The woke culture ruining every damn movie...this is the worst
2:11 0:38 1:38 1:42
The acting is pretty bad But somehow still a decent movie 6.5/10
Tobin Bell ❤
Couldn’t finish watching, turned it into an absolutely comedy, very insulting to all Saw fans out there. This shouldn’t have been released! Chris rock doesn’t fit for this, he sounds like a joker all the time. Don’t waste your time, skip this sh*t.
What is nick fury's do in this universe .. is that skrull
2:00 Are we watching this video I didn't notice the Billy the Puppet Picture right there the first. Aslo I'm watching this because of Saw X that came out recently, and watching this now is like boy I can't help but say GI Jane 2 can't wait to see it
Nice spinoff
THAT SPIN-OFF REBOOT FILM TO "SAW" FRANCHISE WAS HILARIOUSLY AWFUL BECAUSE THE ENDING WAS A TOTAL COMEDY GOLD, LOL! 🐷🎃🔪🌀🎬🎥👎😂
Cris Rock  so bad acting in this movie
troon voice jigsaw is the only frightening thing about this trash
Chris Rock is cool but i think he just wasn’t right for this role he’s a comedian at heart and with saw I don’t think that’s what you bring to the series
The worse Saw movies by far
Villain sound gay
I couldn’t watch this. Chris rock isn’t meant for horror. Can’t take him seriously. He carries comedy everywhere.
THATS A FUCKING LEGEND MOCIE
me and my dad were watching the movie on netflix, my dad left in 10 minutes because the “fuck”-counter was getting too high
Will smith shows up and slaps again😂😂😂
If you love the saw movies, you like this. I think this was a great movie.
I keep hearing circus Afro when I hear Chris rock
0:43 Are Thise The Laughs Of The Children In The FNAF Movie
I swear this is the wackest saw movie in the franchise. Couldn't even finish the whole movie.
I Think Dad watching Saw?
Chris Rock should play thrillers with Will Smith smacking the shit out of him
I thought I watch Comedy Central in funeral home
Worst Saw movie haha
How tf have I not heard of this movie before..
where can i unsee this BS
It was actually better than the last few Saws.
idont care what people say. even though it has a few trap and is comedy. saw for ever❤❤❤
LOL who told Chris Rock he could act?
Jigsaw in minds me of Halloween you can’t kill Michael Myers when you think he’s done with the movie, he always makes more and more and more that’s wassup
Can’t take this seriously 😂
I saw this and it was so bad
for me it was dogshit
where can i watch saw 9?
1:54 the ending is my favorite
I'm sorry. I can't NOT hear Marty the zebra.
I recently watched this movie and was very disappointed. This is different from the other Saw movies I've seen and loved. Although Chris Rock is a fantastic actor, the movie doesn't work for him. I find it difficult to take him seriously. Even if he wasn't in it, the film would still be horrible.
His voice makes it feel like a comedy
Saw X , show them how to do it.
This film is the definitive proof *why Tapp was THE ONE character that got killed off too early.*
The Swirls Look Like The Sega Dreamcast Logo
Didnt like the "jig$aw" voice... Lol
someone shoot the person who came up with the concept of putting a mini-trailer in front of the trailer
I wish I was dumb enough to enjoy this
So I take it no sequel 😢
The trailer was good but the movie was disappointing
Worst of the franchise
Who was the casting director, and never allow them to work in film again. Please, and Thank You.
Worst movie in mortal games I hope they never call this catfish Chris for the franchise again
I just love that Philadelphia is in this
SAW X (2023)
One of the funniest movie of the year
Not gonna say it's bad, but it's just....okay.
bro thinks he's serpico
Chris Rock is a HORRIBLE actor. Omg. Stick to standup.
Dam this was actually good. Specifically like the fact they didn’t give away hindsight clues as to who the killer was. R
Pllot twist: it’s actually a spinoff of Everybody Hates Chris
This is not the worse saw movie ok the wanted to try something different that’s all and sometimes people don’t like different things unlike me I actually enjoy watching this movie
трейлер кусок говна
2:11 BALLOON BOy
horseshit
damn
The last time I had this much bloody fun was in 2017’s JIGSAW…love this franchise…
Absolutely disgusting. How dare you substitute an alpha male like John Kramer with a guy from LGBTQ2++/---- or whatever name you call it? His voice is so disgusting that I didn't even want to see through the end. John would not kill innocent people. He would give a chance to everyone too. This BS guy who sounds like a guy over the gayhotline had some mental disorders. I am so sick and tired of seeing this BS LGBTQ2++/--- everywhere, in schools, Hollywood, TV series and etc. F that S man!

Just saw this and it was pretty damn good IMO. I've seen BAD movies before...and this is no bad movie..
Please, release Saw X teaser trailer
2023 and now I’m going n watch this 💀🥲
I didn't know they made a saw 9
Why this looks like a SNL parody trailer?
Cris rock .. Samuel Jackson this movie was one time watch
Damn i waa doing time in 2021 i got to watch this
1:25 minute: Nick Fury always appears in your home when you least expect it.
That saw voice is phoned in as hell.
Chris Rock as the lead on this for me doesn't suit him, sorry but horrid acting for me.
21
Just watched I can tell U I'm impressed need a sequel
I watch it on Hulu and expected it to be terrible because of  the bad reviews, but I was surprised and I thought it was actually good!
Its a good movie.
"Pilates doesn't even exist" 🤣😂🤣😂
Shitty movie, glad to so him do something different, director is to blame, and writer, could of been way better. Not Chris fault at all.
Deserve a sequel
Is this movie worth watching? Isn't he scary?
Chris rock's serious face is actually really badass looking. I'd watch this movie just because I'm interesting to see him do something out of his usual. ❤️
Just saw this movie and didn't think I would like it but it was great...please watch it...Chris rock was funny but serious and the plot twist was crazy. They keep you guessing all the way.
Slap slap... 🤡
Why the hell did they have to go choosing Chis for this film. Now I'm gonna be distracted the whole time I watch it trying to guess when he's gonna make me laugh.
For me jigsaw was the last chapter
This was good I can't wait until October to watch spiral 2
Well, this movie was shit. Will Smith's slap to Chris Rock was more exciting than this.
Dead by daylight just got a new survivor
Terrible movie. The Story is so low, stupid..waste of time.
Here’s what the Fibonacci Spiral sounds like in music - perfect for this film!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2P7si9_g_ow
Meh… definitely one of the worst movies in the saw franchise.. would be alot better without rock as main character as well
It's soo freaking, when we get to know the real killer at the end🫠
since will smith's slap
All his screen time made me laugh hahahaha
I honestly didn’t watch this initially because I thought Chris being in it would make it not serious enough to enjoy.  But I finally gave in (as a fan of the Saw series Im general) and I have to say Chris somehow managed to pull off coming off as very serious while also having a sense of humor that didn’t overwhelm the seriousness of the movie nor his overall character…   And I say this as one who’s not real big on Chris as an actor nor comedian… 🤷🏽‍♂️
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿
Did the producer who made this garbage ass movie even watch the other saw movies first? Like wtf is this shit? Saw is not a comedy
Goddamn piece of utter shit. They should’ve never let this crap see the light of day.
I got absolutely pissed when I saw 2:05 in the movie. oh, they bring this in, but then... Oops, completely discarded two seconds later.
Next saw movie will have Chris Tucker

Let the games begin…..
Kylo Ren recorded the tape? 😂
This movie is boring... First to mid movie of saw was the best.
Good movie. Recommended.
Watching Chris Rock trying to act is like watching a squirrel trying to play violin.
That saws gonna smack Chris Rock like Will Smith
Was surprised to see Chris Rock being in this movie, but he did a great job putting the comedy aside and giving the right thriller/horror feeling instead. Great movie.

New films have totally ruined the series... Older ones looked scary as straight out from dark web but newer ones are just too modern or over-stylized, just like any other film these days... Jigsaw was all gore but not that thrilling and spiral too
This is the worst movie ever in 'SAW' movie series Don't Make This Movie's Sequel👎 Make the Old Movie Sequel✌️🔥🔥🔥
Is this as violent as the other SAW movies?
Oh sweet baby Jesus it's Max Minghella.
Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson seem miscast in a horror movie like this.  It also feels so empty of this being the first film not to feature Tobin Bell as John Kramer aka Jigsaw.
Emphasizes on the hidden noir elements of the first couple of Saw Movies (especially Saw 2 and Donnie Wahlberg's detective character), that owes serious debt to Se7en.  I kinda liked it but it felt less like a torture horror flick and more like a dark and twisted detective thriller (think Se7en or Bone Collector).
Chris is not for that kind if movies! I can say that they should have use other guy for that role! Sorry Chris but you almost destroy that movie .
Chris Rock is little bit funny, was so funny legend.
Let me guess the girl is jigsaw?😅
Sorry for saying this but chris rock wasn't good in this film. Everything is good but him.
Trash 💩
Samuel L Jackson should call the avengers
This movie was a GD joke.
10/10 so fucking good!
why did I feel like everytime Chris Rock speak, is like he is about to deliver a punchline.
Is this saw 9?
I think thr guy that asked him "when was the last time you seen your father?" Jigsaw
This movie SUCKS.
I quit watching this 2.00 minutes in. WHY? WHY? Why are you doing that?  Because they wouldn't have a movie.  Yeah but it's so stupid.   And I turned it off. Can't.  JUST CAN'T!  Only two minutes in and already we're in Stupid Ville.  I just can't.
The trailer was better than the movie. Why did they cut out certain lines though?
I watched this last night and I’m watching it again.  It’s actually a really good movie. I like the use of pigs as this whole movie is about dishonorable cops.
Marty why u have to do this🤣
Chris Rock SUCKED throughout this whole fucking movie. The idea thàt SAMUEL L. JACKSON WAS HIS FATHER WAS EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS. Like give me a break. You couldn't get John David Washington as the main and Denzel Washington as his father? (Which literally is father and son) Like two SERIOUS actors who definitely could have made this a way better movie? You had to go with Chris FUCKING ROCK??? Yea, no. Liked the movie minus the choice in actors.
Wow it's hard watching Chris in this movie.  Terrible
spoilers : it was the new detective hes partner: the person who said i thought the jigsaw was dead
If it’s October, it’s not longer Saw ;(
Mantén la máscara de jigsaw fuera de pu## mano 🤣
I never know there saw 9
You see, there are two things that are true for comedians, in way over 90% of the cases. Almost each and every comedian is an outstanding actor overall looking and judging. They can act practically each serious role! But this is where the catch comes. After becoming a successful comedian, and you stay successful for a period of time, all people get,already have formed, a very structural and solid image about you. And based on it,  it's extremely hard (in some cases, even impossible) for the audience to see you in a serious role. Especially if the change is sudden, not gradual. It's simply a fact of life, a cultural phenomenon, and the way our brain reacts.  After a period of time, and a series of roles, which must be chosen very methodically and carefully, a comedian actor can begin to be accepted by the viewers as a complete actor, who does all kinds of roles (which he is, to begin with. But remember, we are talking about the viewers' perspective) and does it really good.  And that's exactly the case with Chris Rock From being Chris Rock all his life, to suddenly become a detective who will deal with Jigsaw murderer?!? That's a very hard and tough pill to swallow, let alone digest it, no matter how great he portray the character! People expect Chris Rock to do a parody of Saw, not the real thing! That's why I can't expect a huge success and turnaround for Chris, and the franchise it self - which has lost its credibility for some period, big time! And having Samuel L. Jackson as a side-kick in it, the man for whom people won't be surprised to see him even in their own, old home videos... isn't a very strong injection that would help the movie!
This film was utterly  shit, I  think if the the lead was played by Chris rock it could have been a lot better.  Until this every film has been brilliant,  and no!
Rubbish
Somebody PLEASE tell Chris Rock to leave SAW franchise alone.. you fucking ruined it man
This movie is more funny then thrilling and it dims the light of the Saw series by saying "from the book of saw" LMAO this film and its acting  is from the book i use when i take a shit!
Where is Will Smith?
Have to say it was the best Saw movie since the first one, not sure why people disliked it so. It even made Chris Rock tolerable for the first time. The killer was telegraphed super early but good movie.
Filme horrível!!
This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's written and acted like a bad high school drama production.
Where is the part 2 of this?
Bull Sh!t
واحد من أسوء افلام Saw افشل فيلم في السلسلة
Great movie but sadly ended in a pathetic way .
Bullshit movie ngl
How come the bad guy gets away??!
where is spiral two'
Want to play games m***********
horrendous acting. its so bad ,its unwatchable
It’s a good story line but Chris rock can’t act in this he’s only good in funny films
Is we getting a part 2
Jesus after about 20 mins of watching I knew who the killer was. Lo and behold I was right. Way too predictable
Billy the puppet: Game Over.
Once again we get over acting, over compensating, long drawn out almost tedious to watch; fodder. 👀Actors in the wrong roles, bad management re characters played by them AND just another reason why Western movies these days; suck.😗
this movie was so mediocre.. not good nor bad just.. forgettable
Will Smith behind all this
Jeeeeezz.. I did not expect that ending 😨
Wow best one yet! I honestly didn't expect much from this movie from the trailer but Chris rock was amazing! Give this a chance
Awful movie, biggest pile of shit I've seen in a while.
I really enjoyed the movie but the start of character development annoyed me.. I thought we gonna have another woke movie lucky dropped it and I really enjoyed it, I do love the actors in this
Just seen it pop up on Netflix, I then came here to see what people think and now I'm away back to Netflix again to spend my day off work watching some "Spiral" Sounds like time welll spent
Chris Rock - not an actor, not a comic. Movie could be way better with a real actor not this asshole..never liked him even before oscars with Will Smith.
Usually the first thing you hear is HEEEEEEELP!!  After Saw 3, I was out - it just got too scary...
Done watching it on netflix. 10/10 masterpiece
I find it hard to take this seriously cause it's Chris Rock.. LMAOOO
GOOD MOVIE. WORTH WATCHING.
This movies is very very very bad … i don’t recommend to watch it ever
Not used to Chris Rock so serious. 😂
He’s right in front of u the whole time good movie but it could have been better
Chris Rock is not a great actor. The script wasn't great either. I still enjoyed it though 👍🏻
Careful. Will Smith might pop out of nowhere
The plot twist in this movie is just *chef's kiss*
This movie slapped Chris, hard.!
*chris rock and sam l jacksion* dam
I liked it :D And i m very picky...
The worst and the best Movie the ending is so dumb bro watch it yourself this movie is fokin' dumb
i guess the villain acted by will smith? lol
it was worth watching for AND hoping for a  continuation for Zeke's story here.
Jigsaw might as well be Will Smith
Tbh every time I hear Chris Rock speak I can’t get the image of Marty from Madagascar out of my head
Marty the zebra/Mouseblood the mosquito/Osmosis Jones and Frozone are in this movie
Spiral is officially 1 year old!!! It's another worthy entry in the franchise  Chris Rock is able to be serious and not just funny  It's a shame Samuel L. Jackson isn't in the movie enough  The gore is still plentiful next to the elaborate traps but I wish they were more focused on  Like Saw 8 this turns into more of a police procedural  It's noble tackling police corruption, dirty politics, broken law enforcement, race relations but it doesn't really go anywhere with it  It's very short too  Still the urban culture feel is appreciated by director Darren Lynn Bousman whos worked on multiple films before I'm still wondering where they can go from this point on   IGN gave it a 3/10....damn  But Rotten Tomatoes gave it 46%
He talks like a robot no emotions at all.
Not gonna lie it disturb me very much, have it to you?
this was the worst movie in saw series ever, it was more like a comedy movie than horror
“Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth"
Bu zenci ye kadar ABD oyucu yokmuydu ?
SAW   9
The best thing about this movie was the 21 Savage song at the end😂😂😂
i didnt watch the trailer BUT THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY GETS 10/10  ,  20/20 TO LOL PLEASE GO WATCH❕AND AT THE END OF THE MOVIE (   21 SAVAGE   ) KILLED THAT SPIRAL TRACK  'I MEAN THAT'
This movie slaps!
Lotta weirdo Haters and children in this comment section…  Spiral is the 2nd best Saw series movie.  The female captain and all of the Police hate in this movie were the only bad parts.   This movie made it seem like all Police are crooked.
Good movie but to easy to figure who dun-it
I just caught the end of this movie.  It was a pretty good ending.  I can't wait until I see the entire flick.
What's your favorite scary movie
I’m mad at spiral because they’re killing my favorite character and the main character Samuel Jackson
The Woke brigade decided to make Saw into a black gangster movie, Does this shit ever end, it has to right.
So will smith slapped him
This movie sucks!
Chris Rock in a serious movie feels really odd. lol
This movie is giving me lots of "Se7en" vibes!
Horrible decision to bring Rock to this movie... not that he isn't a great actor, he's just not fit for these kind of movies
This had to be the worst movie of the series......
Awesome, a woman protege of Jigsaw? What am I talking about, I haven't seen this nor any of the originals. 🤣
Plot twist: will smith was behind all the traps
Wait is that Osmosis?
Next victim would be Will Smith in Spiral 2.
Chris won't be able to star in Spiral 2: Saw due to the slap that Will Smith gave it to him. Further announcements will be notified!
SKSKSKS I NEED TO WATCH THESE MOVIES
he better not get slapped by jigsaw
Will the next saw trap be The Will Smith Slapper
i can’t take Chris Rock seriously 😭
Great actors! Chris Rock is cute, also Uzumaki
Just imagine one of will smith's characters hits him
Who's here after Will Smith slapped him
who else to see chris rock after oscar slap🤚🏻
Went back here after Will Smith slap Chris Rock at the Oscars 😑
Watching this trailer on the 1 year anniversary makes me wish Will Smith slaps Chris Rock for trying to do serious acting roles because no one takes it seriously. Lmfao
1 year today
Trailer is comedy gold, 10x funnier than the movie. Made me see the movie when it came out.
it was a GI Jane joke
Looking back months later, the trailers make Spiral look more exciting than the movie itself, I really wish I would have done better, it's not completely terrible, but unfortunately it's just what we had hoped it to be
Everybody loves Chris
I’m here after that slap
in this movie will they also give him a slap?
spoiler alert: will smith is the new jigsaw killer.
I hope Chris Rock Iwill be present in the next SAW! I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED wit Will. His job in this movie was amazing!
Brodie got smacked awl😭🫡
Lionsgate ❤️
Whos watching this after chris rock got punched
who's here after the slap?
“As you can see, you are in a room with Will Smith. In front of you is a paper with jokes, each of wich you have to read out loud. If you don’t, this needle filled with acid will inject in your arm. Wanna play a game?”
Is this will smith new movie?
Will Smith will definitely want to star in the next Spiral film
Who comes into here because he was slapped by Will😅
Who’s watching this after the slap???
Key and peele got this covered Hahaha same jigsaw voice too
Damn! Did you see the post credit scene where he got slapped?!
Spiral 2 : Will Smith
Chris Rock is more afraid of Will Smith
21 SAVAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Que porcaria de filme!!!! Na boa Crhis Rock, seu negocio e comédia pai, num inventa!!!!
Chris Rock is the only one who make this good movie weird and cringe af. So disappointed
Also visit our vlog, don't forget to like and subscribe, thank you in advance😁
Ruined the Saw franchise. Why does the new voiceover sound like a 12 yr old w/ a shitty voice changer instead of Kramer's voice? Stupid decision. Chris Rock is an awful actor outside comedy. Most of movie was focused on trivial shit instead of the actual games like in Saw 1-5. Way to ruin it you jackasses.
if you are a "SAW" fan , . . . please stay away from this garbage called "Spiral" . . .  it's nothing but pure disappointment. .
THIS IS THE FRST TIME IM SEING CHRIS ROCK AND IM NOT LAUGHING... WHT AN AWSOME TLENT
The Batman
The new Batman movie literally used this as it's plot
The killer is too obvious like i knew who it was since the first time I saw him
The worst acting I’ve ever seen… seeing Chris rock trying to act like a “tough cop” was hilarious…. Jeezes…. Just cringe… watch it if you’re looking for a good laugh. The guy can’t act..
Boring...
After watching madagascar can't never get afro circus zebra out the head when watching Chris Rock polkadot polkadot can't even be serious in saw laughing all the way
I watched this crap and now I feel like Amazon owe me money. Rock should continue using his "acting" to do Zebra voices
1:20, 1:31
🤔🤔🤔
probably one of the worst saw movies ive seen. i was disappointed...
This movie is shit
Had never heard of this. And I can see why. This shit looks wack af lol. I luv Chris Rock. But sometimes u gotta know ur limitations. I can't take him seriously as the serious, hardened detective lol.
Crap
The script is weird.
I personally think this was the best one since the first 3
Shit movie LOL, idk why you would give this movie to CHRIS ROCK of all people LOL. has he ever done anything like this no! what a waste of time
21 Savage has come a long way bro damn
One of the worst films I have ever seen.
Chris Rock? I can't wait to laugh at this comedy movie.
can't take Chris Rock seriously 😂😂
Wasn't brilliant PLUS it had BUGGER all to do with the Saw films because all the flashbacks were nothing from the previous 8 films!!  (I don't see why they couldn't just let it finish on 7 films because even that Jigsaw film which was before the latest one was NOWHERE near as good as the rest.)
So this the new make  of saw movies
Wow so not used to see sam L jackson with two eyes.
Is this is one who was in Gotham
I don't care what the critics said. This is a good addition to the saw universe. I even liked it better than Jigsaw. At the end, I wanted to root for Chris Rock. But I really liked the copycat. His play at the end there was perfect. Would love a sequel.
_0:05__ how lovely. A gift from Tiffany’s._
More black ppl Please xd
My ✊🏾 for Chris , this guy make me laugh for years until tears , see him in this different role , was incredibly amazing.
I can’t believe Samuel l Jackson died so brutal even tho he’s a bad ass in saw too
I like Chris Rock but this movie ain't funny.
I’m sorry. But the only thing I can hear is Marty…
Nothing will ever equal or beat the original SAW.  This isn't anything worthy of SAW.   Very disappointed.
One of the worst movies I've ever seen, it has nothing to do with the "original saw" and it's so boring that I thought I've lost 4 years of my life just by watching this. Really, boring, unexciting, and obviously not interesting. The traps weren't even as good as the old ones
Saw 1 is way better
Chris Rock screaming...not the first time.
_I just watched the movie a few minutes ago.Its a masterpiece 👌🔥 Those who haven't watched it till now.I would just recommend it for sure ❤️_  *Thanks to the whole crew for this movie*
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I saw this movie, yow, it's fck up bloody crazy.
i know a movie is good when i want to remove the whole swat teams limbs (at the end)
0:01
Pigsaw
I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but it's a really good movie, if you haven't seen it yet, go ahead and watch it. is very good
Bring back Billy the puppet
It’s weird seeing Chris Rock in a horror movie when you just rewatched grown ups
What a piece of trash this movie is, they shat on the Saw legacy
Chris did a amazing job man thought it would be hard to take him serious but did he bring the emotion
want to play a game?
First Rodrick, now Nick Fury. The multiverse really is real after all.
L
blm? :D
Is this a Saw spin-off??
mannnn Chris Rock is a versatil actor..
I imagine Marty the zebra and I'm dead.
This movie sucked ass.
😮😮😮😮😮😮
Well Samuel l Jackson won't be saying Mother f***** line for a long time. 👍
I just can't take this serious with Chris Rock in this role
WORST OF ALL SAW SERIES. WORST! U gonna regret watching this. I could say just WORST.
Chris Rock stand up is fire.....but dude cannot act to save his life...His acting skills are so trash.....He has 2 facial expressions & 0 acting range, and I couldn't get into the movie....It was straight for $1.75 at the redbox, dont feel ripped off, dont feel satisfied.....
Climax... Superb..... Significantly adore...
I dont like the story its good, but i hate that actor of zeke, so fucking overacting ! Never again gonna watch movie with that actor on it
It was the partner 😔  damn y’all my bad
SPOILER: IT WAS THE NEW PARTNER
This movie went in way to many directions that it didn't know which way was the right way to go.
I think the police need to not chase these jigsaw killers anymore. They do society a favor honestly.
Here a suggestion.. can your all.. create spin-off / canon / missing chapters / Side-Story.. titled as "SAW : Amanda/Red Scarf /Junkie" or anything else..   after hearing Amanda theme song.. we need those disciple story..
This is the second time Samuel L Jackson portrayed a corrupt cop  The first time he played was in GTA: San Andreas as tenpenny
1:20 reminds me of " C.A :winter Soldier"  Fury is that you....
Razz it up
... and then it starts all over again.  film after film after film as in a spiral.  however, I think the doll is incredibly scary.  awful and a little cute somehow.
It was SO BAD!
Ahhh just finished! It was so good! 🔥🔥🔥🌀
The actor spoiled the whole goddamn movie.
It was a great movie minus Chris Rocks goofy ass voice
Bruh Jigsaw has been dead since Saw 3. How long they keep trying to capitalize of this franchise?
After watching it I can say...not a fan..i love most of the originals but this..just kinda felt like it had a agenda..also John Kramer was a much more intriguing character who had alot of depth to his origin..the plot twist was easily guessed as well..I feel I would have liked this a bit better if the saw franchise wasn't attached to it..all the characters were unlikable to me and very unreal..its not a horrible movie but its not great..but thats my opinion, hope you all like it more then me
In the book,it was a boz full of penises instead of fingers because there are so many perverts.
these greenscreen movies feel like they were filmed in my grandmother's basement.
Bro every time I hear Chris rock I picture Marty from Madagascar 😂
Oooo
According to director Darren Lynn Bousman, a trap consisting of someone getting their face cut off had to be cut from the film in order for it to receive an R rating from the MPAA.  Chris Rock is a fan of the "Saw" franchise and pitched the idea to Lionsgate. As a result, they made him one of the lead actors, a co-writer, and executive producer.  The first film in the series not to be released in October  In order to secure an R rating, the film had to be submitted to the MPAA 11 times. All other attempts resulted in a rating of NC-17.  The first "Saw" film to not utilize the annual October Blood Drive with advertised poster models.  Darren Lynn Bousman revealed that Detective Drury originally had a bigger role and a "horrific death scene", but they cut it out for being "too much".  Marisol Nichols' second horror film, following "Scream 2" (1997).   This is the third film in the franchise where the phrase "Game Over" is not used; the other films that do not include the phrase are "Saw V" (2008) and "Jigsaw" (2017).  William Schenk marks the fourth Jigsaw Killer that had a family member killed. It is revealed that John Kramer lost his son, Gideon, in "Saw IV" (2007); Mark Hoffman lost his sister, Angelina, in "Saw V" (2008); and Logan Nelson lost his wife, Christine, in "Jigsaw" (2017).  Even though a photo of Tobin Bell is shown in the film, the actor did not receive any credit.  Is the second film in the series to be framed at 2.35:1. The first film to be framed in 2.35:1 was Jigsaw (2017).  Darren Lynn Bousman revealed that he was very angry during the finger-skinning sequence, knowing that they lost so much of it to the whims of the MPAA. "You saw every finger break, every bone pop, every knuckle snap."  Darren Lynn Bousman wanted a subway tunnel, but he was told the logistics just weren't in the budget. He held his ground, and they eventually built a subway tunnel set to meet their needs. It's a tiny set that uses forced perspective to make things look bigger than they are  The previous working title was "The Organ Donor".  According to Chris Rock, two films that were the inspiration for this film are "Seven" (1995) and "48 Hrs." (1982). Chris Rock's first horror film.
Terrible ended 😪 dam like seriously this movie incomplete seriously dang where the rest of the movie at .
do yourself a favour if you love the original movies. don't watch this. it absolutely sucks. i could spoil it by saying what happens, but i won't.  traps arent particularily well made. reasoning for what happens is good enough just that things were hardly fair. its amanda all over again. but not in a good storytelling way
Plenty of comments on Chris rock but not enough on how absolute ass the new voice for the tape recordings is. Sounds like Kermit the frog trying to muffle his voice or something. Really wish they would have gone with something slightly intimidating
Dame I love these movies , You twisted f@cks, thanks for making sick ass movies❤❤🙏🙏🤣🤣
I like Chris rock but this movie is really bad
Surprisingly good ! I’d recommend for sure
Trash!!!!
I actually enjoyed this. I didn't realise it was part of the saw franchise and went into it not expecting this, so quite enjoyed it. It also leaves it open for another film. I think maybe chris wasn't the right choice for this type of film. Someone else would have done more justice. I did actually predict who the killer was right at the beginning, though i didn't guess the motive.
Its a series of 8 parts now i found it gonna watch it
For me this film is 10/10. Enjoyed all the twists, jokes and classic SAW style.
Chris is not a good drama actor. Doesn't fit
About to watch it. Skeptical.  The voice of Jigsaw is weird sounding, they should have gotten a better voice. The Saw franchise is a really good one. Love Samuel L Jackson and Chris rock, but not sure this looks like it’s going to stand up to the same level of gore we are used to. Fingers crossed.
A Jamaican nanny tho ?  Is he crazy ?
Is this still a jigsaw??
I’d like to see this. But I’ll keep my expectations low. Sam Jackson is badass, but Rock is a comedian. And always will be. CB4?
Is theres a game on this movie saw?
Melhor filme de todos os tempos!!
It’s funny nobody will complain about the racism in this movie but will complain about the racism in Karen.notice how black racist jokes are “just a opinion” but white racist jokes are just “racist”
I hear chris and all I see is a zebra
Its not a bad movie thanks to Chris and Samuel,  the voice of the killer on the TV/recorders annoyed me so much, I fuckin hate it
Ok no this needs to stop im a saw fan since the first movie but im done now for sure i can't take this b.s anymore. I love chris rock as a comedian. Now they put him as a detective and the name went from Jigsaw to spiral... What's next tricycle? Or pigmask? This movie trailer saved me 60-80 bucks from going to the movie theater like i used to for all the Saw movies and did for Jigsaw. Jigsaw wasn't that impressive, the only reason i paid to see it first hand was to see Tobin Bell (John kramer) and his connection to the plot. But now he is dead the story wont change so im officially done.
I thought the killer would have had a connection to Kramer and the last trap 2 trap was shit
Very disappointing
It was interesting but it was so obvious who the killer was.
Any movie where they are killing cops...white cops is a dam good movie....
ngl this is probably one of the best trailers recently. sad the movie was mediocre af
BEEN passing this movie I had no idea it was a jigsaw 🧩 yay watching NOW on Hulu
The entire time watching this movie all I could think is why on earth would they get Chris rock to play this role… he did absolutely horrible lol
Why is it called "From the 'book' of Saw." What does that mean?
I just saw Jigsaw and there they showed that John Kramer wasn't in his coffin. So where was he? Was he still alive? Will Spiral mention what happened?
There’s a war in America right now. Police detectives vs JIGSAW COPYCATS and Jigsaw copycats HAVE GOT TO GO!
This movie is better than I thought Rock delivered as well as the rest off the cast...
This was trash, especially Chris Rock’s performance
I think it’s gonna be that one girl that said she was gonna continue Jigsaws games. That’s why the voice has a voice changer.
Best ending, just watch it !
"You said the n-word on Twitter 10 years ago, for that reason I've hooked your nipples up to a falling anvil."
I've seen it. Good plot actually but its hard to take Chris seriously with his cute voice and googly eyes. Damn.
Oh neat... who was working with JigSaw THIS time?
This is a movie as if they want you to mix ice cream with sausages and they want you to like a flavour You distorted the original saw movie, especially the voice of the one on TV
i love crhis, but damn his acting is cringe AF XD
JESUS CHRIST, I KNEW THE SEGA DREAMCAST WAS THE KILLER ALL ALONG!!!!
Avoid this complete crap. It ruined the Saw legacy. Honestly, I kinda liked Jigsaw in 2017. It had problems, but I still think it brought something new. This was horrible, just...horrible.
" he could be anywhere , he could be anyone ...he could be Trivago!"
Chris rock in leading role.. what were they thinkinggggg ffs
I just watched this movie on STARZ HD  (Oct 8) and the ending threw me completely OFF! The guy gave all the clues and no one caught on. Chris is good in this movie.
As soon as this movie ended, I immediately named it number 1 on the list of worst movies ever. It should be called straight to voicemail or Dumb Ass A Cop! Never have I ever seen such a horrific horror!! Goodness gracious that was dumb!!!!!!
Chris actually... rocks.
I Hated movies with sad ending😭🙄
I prefer Chris doing horror than comedy.
God loves you so much 💞
God loves you so much 💞💞
God loves you so much 💞
God loves you so much 💞💞
So realistic but scenario really just ok ...
I think that it would be awesome if Javier Bardem performs in upcoming chapters of the movie.
This episode is worth all previous episodes. Final of the movie is amazing. The single negative side of the movie is that there are lots of swearings. Congrats! Great Job.
I enjoy the saw movies but I can’t take this movie seriously with these actors lol
I love movie so much
This film is utterly crap, they needed to pick a better actor for main protagonist, bar Samuel A Jackson, the " acting was dire.
he did a great job!
It's kinda like scary movie, but unintentionally
It’s about time Sam collabed with Chris.
Bad start with Chris Rock whom never stops running his mouth, and annoying terrible radio rap music...
Good
I've had a little theory about this film ever since this trailer. My guess is Chris Rock didn't want to just be cast as only a comedian so he went to the studio and basically asked to be given a movie in a known property that he could stick his name in, play a serious character, and just kinda coast off the fans of the series. So they gave him saw since there isn't much you can do to mess with a series in the ninth movie. At this point the title could describe the story overall.
I would like a second one please & thank you
I love Samuel L Jackson! He always brings a cool sense of humor no matter what the role is
Not as good as Japanese's Spiral aka Uzumaki 2000. You should see the comic version too to give you the creep.. This west movie look so boring .
?? Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson is superb
Damn why Chris Rock he's such a shity actor.
Chris rock is nick fury's long lost son
It could have been great but it was like watching a soap opera from end to finish. I hope if there's a sequel there is a different director that actually knows suspense and horror.
ending iz BAD
I just watched this hopefully a part 2 comes out
what is this trash
Chris Rock being serious, for once? Lol
Seriously , they got Marty to do a horror movie . I can’t watch this seriously
Freu mich schon drauf, nächste Woche ist Kino angesagt 😀👌👌👌👌
Ehh, idk. It just doesn't have that eerie skin crawling terror that Saw1-7 had. I won't judge it until I see it though.
Ouch, the acting was so cringe in this. It’s a shame because the story and special effects were totally on par with what we have come to enjoy in other instalments.
Voll schlecht
Jigsaw right
Everyone thinks it's weird seeing Chris Rock serious but I just finished watching fargo so it dosent really bother me
So they make Saw into "comedy horror drama" movie!😂 And where's Logan??
Algum Brasileiro 🤣🤣😅😅😅😅
This movie was garbage.
Good movie...  The ending is awesome! It was a good revenge!
So it turns out I am the only one not put off by Chris Rock being in this.
I wanna think this shit never happen. Da hell was this movie? WTF Chris Rock lol
first part is good like Saw. the rest is rubbish with Chris Rock trying to be funny. it's not funny it's boring.there all low budget now because they aren't making any money.making stuff like this for Netflicks.
Our childhood horrors back to haunt us again
Watched this today..The ending of the movie 😳 omg
is this really connected with SAW?
Movie is good .. the ending was a little off ...
Great to see Nick from HMT in his first movie yay 👍
I can't take most of these comments seriously that so many positive reviews are being written here lol. The dialogue, script, acting overall was so dull that it most seemed like a parody Saw in general.
Chris Rock acting serious in a horror movie... Eww no!
This movie was evil
The zebra became the prey. Good movie! Still clever each time🤙
Say whatever you want about the movie, but this trailer was amazing!
That's not a good idea to make a copycat of jigsaw he plays better than this
Funniest film of the decade…….is in the comedy genre isn’t it???
Chris Rock was hella good in this movie, tho some lines were kinda comedy. Can’t believe the villain was the guy from The Handsmaide Tale. 👀
0:53
Why do comedians obsess about making depressing ass films towards the end of their careers? Ai
Just finished watching this movie. It was really good compared to the Jigsaw one. Though I gotta say, some parts of it were somehow predictable but what makes it different is the characters and the actors portraying them. This is actually the first time that I laughed on a gore/horror movie. Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson really managed to do well on their role; as they also applied humor on it.  All in all, it was really fun watching this. And by the way, I was kind of expecting Sam Jackson to say his well known "motherf*cker" on this one LMAO
it's so bad it's good
Chris Rock and serious acting just don't go together
Algum brasileiro q possa traduzir os comentários rsrsrs
STUPID SAW WANNA BE! just watched this movie and they dont even use the Jigsaw voice and they do flash backs to times you dont even know! didnt even use any of the old story lines! 😡😡😡😡
I saw the Movie... I am annoyed by Chris Rock's over acting (mouth and eyes)...
Hey listen, after a couple times watching this trailer, I don’t mind his voice. I think it’ll be good.
this is the zebra guy
This is a joke right 🤣🤣 ill laugh to death.
In can't believe Chris Guy is the one of the hilarious friends in Grown Ups.
IM THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER!! OHHHHHHHHHHH
WHO told Chris Rock that he can act? Wtf ruined Fargo and everything that he touches.
I can’t believe his partner was shown in the trailer
So no one is gonna mention the soft voice they used to play the killer?? 😭😆
A DISAPPOINTMENT
Reminds me of a talking zebra
Kill Count:  The Spiral Killer/William Emerson: 7 Rooftop Cop: 1 Det. Finch: 1 Pete Dunleavy: 1  Total: 10
I dont know how I missed this loving the saw series up until 3D. I am not sure how to feel about the last one and this makes me wonder even more.
This is a really underrated movie. The 5.3 rating it has right now on IMDB is absolutely crazy and the only explanation is people not giving more importance to the plot than to the acting. The plot was really good. Better than any other saw sequel. The traps were really creative and pain-inflicting. The only bad thing I see in this movie is Chris Rock's acting which was really awful. The rest was great. It was very entertaining. For the genre it is easily an 8.5 out 10. If you like a  "horror" movie with a good plot and can ignore bad acting by the lead actor, it's a must-watch.
It won't be that scary as previous movies all because of one voice.
they just can't let this series go...lol
Looks like it was made by any kid low quality
I burst into a laugh as soon as I heard Chris Rock's voice
Chris rock should stick to comedy, this is his biggest joke yet !
Saw original done by Aussies was good yanks ruined it as per usual
So disappointed 😞 the voice of criss take away all of the "seriousness" not to mention the terrible voice of jigsaw. Lame
This is by far Chris Rock's funniest work.
1.27-1.32 - Did Nick Fury show up at the wrong house and not Captain America’s ?
Really good. Better writing than the last 7 movies and the end is awesome
Seen the movie. It was great. Pretty predictable who's the killer is. But great.
Was a good movie ..
Looks like he is gonna do something and make us laugh
Rock still sounds like Pookie when he's not doing comedy but I guess I just saw that movie a lot of times and can't get it out of my head
There is a plot twist zeke partner is jigsaw he kills zeke dad to get revenge
this movie has a straight to video feel about it
Don't waste your time on this. Its not good. Its not even a horror movie.
Chris Rock did AMAZING! Great movie! ❣
Why is Nick Fury here? He ain’t speaking to Captain America!
I think everyone in the comments who are talking about not taking Chris Rock seriously really need to get over the pitch in his natural voice. LOL A voice is a voice. His jokes aren't only funny because of his voice - it's his delivery and how he makes the jokes. I'm taking a chance on this film without bias.
Film was ruined the minute Chris rock was included , love the saw films but can’t get into this with him as the main guy
1:41 spiral spiral spiral spiral spiral
Тупейший фильм
This movie was very disappointing, the actors screamed their dialogue all the time. That being said, Chris Rock in the Saw universe is a hoot to watch.
the song started getting badass at 1:55

Good film!
Movie last scene super duper 👍👍👍
This movie was horrible. What a waste of my time. Go watch 2019 parasite with subtitles for real cinema.
GREAT FREAKIN MOVIE!!!! omg 😳 the ending gave me chills🌀 definitely recommend to watch 10/10 !!!! Sheeeeeesh
The voice won't allow me to take this seriously.  Maybe Steve Urkel would have been a better choice.
It's hard for me to watch Chris Rock in a role  where he's not being funny. Also the movie plot sucked I had it figured out 15 minutes in. It's nowhere near as good as the other Saw movies. That's just my opinion though.
People can’t come up with their own ideas smh
waste of time
This movie was fucking amazing
Brutal movie and hilarious performance of Chris. But, in my opinion, Samuel (though he is also a very good actor) wasn't suitable for this type of movie.
This movie was amazing! I loved it from start to finish. The emotions, the twist. Amazing. Didn't expect any of it.
First off, great story! Cops definitely got what they deserved!  Second, Chris Rock SUCKED in this movie! His acting was horrible!  Third, the "SAW" aspect of the movie was spot on, great torture devices! Fourth, Chris Rock SUCKED in this movie! What's up with his face? Botox? Fifth, the music sucked!!!!!! It could've been a really good movie......
🗣"When was the last time you seen ya father ? Yup that wasn't racist at all!  😭😭
That spiral symbol is similar to the pedo symbol those sickos use
Man that was a bad movie,and i enjoyed al first 7 saw movies 😀
Chris rocks voice and sam Jackson’s “motha fockarr” just nahhhh they wrecked this with the cast. Also does Chris rock just scream every line? Does he do it to try get the comedy out of his voice?
*All I Can Hear When He Talks Is Marty Lmao😂*
waste of time
Chris rock has the most irritating voice ever,it's for more the biggest mystery why they made  this man,the main character of this movie. Just as the killer,  that guy has all of the time in the world to create those dead traps, especially the one at the police office, very ridiculous indeed...👉🤡👈
Official last part of saw
And i was thinking, Chris Rock was just a comedian!! though it hard to imagine him as a cop, but he really did well!!
Worst movie in whole jigsaw series. Full of bullshit. Plz stop making jigsaw movies. You all are defaming John kramer.
Well I never expected this shit for Saw, it's ruined.
Ending is not satisfied
Love Chris Rock, Love Saw, but the 2 should not be mixing like milk and Mountain Dew
MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE THE ACTING BY CHRIS WAS FORCED AND HORRIBLE NO CHRIS STICK TO COMEDY MOST OF THE TIMES YOU LOOKED CONSTIPATED.

Awesome everything a saw had add some humor with Chris rock, awesome
did blm write this? saw: defund the police edition
Yay a full black cast and a female killer what more could 2021 wish for 😑
Marty is really going to need Alex, Gloria and Melvin on this one.  Shame that Danny Glover didn't last
Stupid movie doesn't make sense 🙄
Chris Rock did way too much yelling in his Chris Rock voice
better be hoffman as the bad guy!
Killer was Chris Rock new partner. His dad killed by cops when he was 12. BS movie ends with Samuel L dies and Schenk (chris rock partner) gets away.
I don't understand why people enjoy these movies. Why do y'all like this type of shit and draw the scenes it's weird
I haven’t seen this yet, but can someone tell me whether casting Chris Rock for this was a mistake? My gut tells me it probably was.
Movie was eh.... The Killer was Zeke's Partner
I saw the movie and i just couldn't take Chris Rock Serious. I found my self laughing most of the time when he talks  or acts. i give it a 4-10 stars.

Love how they give every detail away in the preview.  Worst installment in the series.  I thought nothing could top SAW 3D in worst in show.  I stand corrected
A Zebra solving a crime is gona be worth watching!!😅
Chris rocks young partner is the killer
when i saw the face of the actor i thought this will be a parody movie
I don’t know why but my favorite line in this trailer is cris rock saying I NEED EVERYONE ON THIS CASE  it just makes his character so Serious about his mission
I cant wait to see this
Disaster movie ever
So nobody during that entire pre-production process went: You know... yeah... Chris Rock...  I mean, this is not for him, man.
Just watched this movie last night. In preparation, I watched Madagascar just to get into the Chris Rock mindset. I'd say it helped me enjoy the movie even more! I'd give it a 7.5/10
Putting comedians in horror movies is so offensive to a horror movie lover😭              -offended horror movie lover 🤣
Guys before watching "SPIRAL" ..  RE-WATCH All SAW Serie and end it with SPIRAL ... TRUST ME.
big oinker
I give it 6 it's not really bad but the ending he could have kill his partner to save his dad too bad ending kinda like cliffhanger we need a sequel
His voice doesn’t fit with the genre of this movie.. if that makes sense.
Why does the jigsaw guy sound like that? 😂 that’s not scary that’s funny
Samuel L. Jackson playing the father of Chris Rock just feels right in so many ways
Not stoked on this one. Anyone see it? How bad was it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Predictable. The twist is Meh!
GOOD LAWD I HATE CRIME!!! 😂🤣
Worse movie ever
Without John Kramer it’s just not the OG jigsaw🥴
Its weird at the same time that chris rock is so serious in this movie

Yeah nah.... at this point, this franchise is over!
A great trailer for a bad movie
Zeke was the only good person in the film.
It wasn’t bad I could tell who the killer was from the jump
The killer was Chris rocks partner. He got away in the end. There saved you all the time. Don't bother watching this shit. It's not even a creepy voice and the doll looks stupid as fuck. The traps are highly unimaginative and this movie lacks true gore. Not to mention chris rock clearly can't do a serious role.
Fan of crisis rock but terrible casting  Pathetic acting from the costars as well Worst saw ever
Madagascar & Saw,  the most ambitious crossover event in history.
Chris Rock is 56 !!!!! Wtf 🤯
I feel like I should be laughing when Chris Rock speaks
Chris Rock = Over acting
miscasted
Just finished watching it, the movie was just okay 2.5/5
The only slasher series that never disappoint me is SAW
Worst Saw I've ever watched, wrong actor for it.
THIS MOVIE WILL SUCK AS MUCH AS NEWEST FF9
Nice to see Lawrence Fishburne in a film again.
WRONG CAST, not even going to bother seeing this....
Zebra in a Spiral, never thought I'd think of that...
How come I haven’t heard of this movie yet
why Me?
"What... you woke now?" lol
It was a good movie
Maybe it's me but all I can hear is Marty😂
Is it worth the 20 bucks for rental?
is that the voice actor of marty from madagascar?
Just watched this and honestly it was actually nice seeing a SAW film with some actual story and character to it. It isn’t simply a gore (bore)fest of a film that was just like the last 5, it actually was worth the watch. Now as for Chris Rock I must say... he actually wasn’t to bad in the roll! Even with his previous record in films as a funny guy he actually did a pretty damn good job all things considered. All in all I’d say the film is a 8/10 the ending was a bit predictable which doesn’t surprise me but the story and kills definitely put this on top with SAW 1.
Why do they keep making Saw movies?  Because idiots like me keep watching them and hoping that just for once, they'd be any good at all.  I really need to stop watching this franchise.
Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson,   Plot twist!  Chris Rock is the one doing all the yelling.
His voice😂😂😂
I bet they took the symbol from the Epstin Island. How was the fun over there mr Rock?
Its obvious you just wanna make $ off of the Jigsaw franchise - you changed the voice and Billy, and it is painful obviously with the change in music that this movie was made to cater to a certain group , at the expense of messing with iconic elements that made the franchise so riveting - shame on you ☹️☹️
This movie trailer I don’t like it’s not the same saw franchise that I grew up with and still watch to this day. Very disappointed the voice wasn’t good and the pig on the tricycle replacing johns voice and billy the puppet Sacrilege
saw movie starring chris rock? i gotta see this
This movie was a let down
this is not chris rock
Please dont watch this movie you're just wasting your time worst movie i've ever watched
Yo the ending had me SHOOK
“Chris rock “ horror movie W or L
I hate the new voice on the recording. When I don’t here Tobin bell, the true jigsaw isn’t around. I know they’re copycats but it’s not the same vibe. It never will be
Why is the main character a black actor again
No offense but who is chris rock??
When it will come out??? Can someone tell me
More excited to see Chris Ramsey in this more than anything else.
damnn
I love Chris rock but he made this movie corny.
Lowkey went to see this with my friends and I called who the killer was before he even showed
I can’t take this movie seriously … with Chris rock involvement
Soon as I saw the "new partner" I knew it was him and I knew the motive. Too easy. Good movie though
Does anyone here for Chris Ramsay ?
Chris Rock can not do drama . Atrocious acting . He should stick to comedy
i cant wait for SawCon im ready to buy tickets to it
Too many black actors in this movie. One of the reasons it bombed at the box office.
Could chris be going brok to take this roll
I do not how but I already saw the entire saga till now, even though I do not like American movies. Let's join through the topic again...
Tobin bell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Watched last night really enjoyed it gripping not for the faint of heart must watch for sure !!
How to stop the intent to harm:   Google: You should never! That isnt the way to solve thing   Bing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Movie sucked ass. The bad guy was lame as shit.
Chris Rock ruined this for me, his acting was utter s***, he was way out of his depth, and I couldn't take him seriously because of his silly voice and facial expressions.
0:55-0:56 nice airsoft glock :).
Chris Rock is just as amazing at portraying dramatic characters as funny ones. And his voice is amazing!
Is this a sketch from SNL ?
Save yourself two hours, extremely predictable from traps to killer. (Should’ve said game over at the end, not good if real series fan)
I'm halfway through the movie and it's soooo bad so far
Jigsaw Matters
Movie was really bad, but Chris Rock? What was that? Never seen such a bad actor.
I love this this jigsaw but more better.
This movie was absolutely shocking. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I've seen some pretty bad ones 🤦🏽‍♂️
I been living up a rock . Didn’t even know this was a movie.
Just watched it was actually pretty dang good
omg NIIIICCCKKK!!! I'm definitely gonna watch this coz Nick/Max is here! (#Handmaidstale) And I've watched all the Saw movies..gotta watch this one too!
Despite the movie not being that good, I honestly thought Rock gave a serviceable performance.
Idk maube it’s coz I haven’t watched a lot of chris rock but I watched the movie and actually thought it was amazing and I acc loved chris as the main character and I thought his acting was amazing idk tho
Watching Chris Rock act is like watching a man have a baby...it ain't happening.
This shit has 39k likes and 2k dislikes. You either have no taste or youtube is lying at me.
imma let them spin like a spiral
Spiral From The Book Of SAW Hostel
5/10 movie screams cheap just in general i fell asleep halfway its just like a repeat of all the other jigsaw movies props to Chris Rock in his acting trying to portray someone who is serious even though most of  his other roles in films/shows hes more of the opposite, TIP: srsly dont waste your time

I can't take Chris Rock seriously lol i can't be the only one.

Im a huge fan of SAW . And love all parts. And this one is the worst. Its ok but not great or any special 😊
It was so predictable that it was the partner...  These movies are predictable.
if u r a SAW fan never watch this movie. i repeat never!!
I really thought that Gordon and Logan Nelson will return in this movie. Actually that's not gonna happen. Anyway, this movies was great.
This movie was trash lol..a disgrace to the saw movies
Chris Rock just can't pull of a serious role. Idk why,. But he ain't Robin Williams.
looks like a parody
i hope this has the 3 main things that make the saw franchise good: gore, a confusing storyline that makes no sense at all and the "there was another person helping john all the time" plot twist
This frenchise has finally been ruined new actors new everything def not watching it unless its on hbo max or netflix smh
I dont like the new actors :/
Yay! 2 of the loudest men in show business, in one movie!
Hmm... I think this is a saw movie
Now this gonna be a good one
Of course the black man grew up without a father.  Such racist writing
Up
Cleaver pure Saw  I didn't see the end coming at All .. & I luv how u subliminally put it out there about 50👍 that shoot First.Pure Genius..Br.Rock I get it...✊
I can’t take chris rock seriously and he can’t really act. But I kinda like nick from handmaid's tale. Still watching the movie though.   UPDATE : I personally wouldn’t recommend watching this movie. I mean I couldn’t even finish it and i’m a saw fan. I absolutely love all the saw sequels but this one definitely wasn’t it🤬
This is an awesome movie man highly recommended
I can’t do crooked cop movies much anymore. Reason This wasn’t disappointing at all. Finally some true justice and I’m not mad about it ... hell that type of mentality could work. If they thought corruption could 🤷🏾‍♀️. Article 8 🙄

Watched this earlier I did , but 15 mins into the movie I already knew who the new Jigsaw was.. So movie was ruined a bit...5/10 I'll rate this one .
I stopped at minute 30...
This was so good hated the ending tho
0:50 *OH MY GOSH IS THAT A ZONAI SWIRL?!?*
Unfortunately I will not be watching this movie because whenever I hear Chris Rock yell or scream I think of Alex from Mada-who-ha not who-ha ascar lol
What movie theater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=2s
There are some trailers that make you wanna see the movie, and then there are some that are crappy enough that they cant convince you to watch the movie.
First time seeing chris rock being serious

But can't believe in the end how the Villain went away... And cannot believe that he is the fucking villain.  Don't want to spoiler this awesome movie ❤️ I recommend to all watch this movie it will change your thinking level 🔥
Just unbelievable movie ❤️🔥 A big live from Bangladesh ❤️🇧🇩(Asia) Want it’s part 2 in 2022 ❤️🔥
Next stop: another Jason movie feat. Ryan Reynolds :D
Greetings you fabulous Earthlings and Happy Friday!👋👽 I bring thin crust pepperoni pizza for everyone. Enjoy! 🍕
Chris in a serious role? This might be interesting.
This was so awful the torture scenes but the rest of the movie was alright in my opinion! Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson did phenomenal in it though!
Is this for kids
2021 made even Chris Rock serious
I think Chris Rock and Samuel l Jackson should have switched roles Chris Rock playing that serious role LOL overall movie was dope
Ivan Duque aparece en varias escenas

not bad movie, not much different from Saw but good watch.
just watched it today. I can't recommend. It's not the worst in the saw series, but it's really not good
I always thought he would do a comedy bit
Worst acting. Everyone seem like amateur. Can't finish the movie, have to giving up. Story line is good, but the acting make the movie seem like stupid horror.
All I can hear is Marty The Zebra
This looks like shit. Chris Rock was funny, but he ain't an actor.
Chris Rock's expressions in this film are all over the map. It's like he decided to try and improv each reaction and just went with the wrong instinctual choice half the time.
Not worthy the band used...
I love Chris Rock but don't wast your time with this, his voice and acting just ruins this movie.
Cris rock, annoying voice, bad acting, wanted his character to disappear from the movie as soon as possible, but to my surprise it was the main thing.
Why does this movie have the spiral symbol  used by pedophiles all over the world,  Many that have been put down like the dogs they were?  I pray that all Pedophiles either come to Jesus or Meet there maker  and end up with there god soon"
He was ok in Fargo for me but this was really bad acting from Chris, and add the fact that it's not his first role as a cop. But it's nice to see Nick of The Handmaid's Tale and Hermione of Riverdale 😀
One word.... MISCAST.
Someone tell me if hoffman is going to make a reappeance!
Casting sucks! Actors should stick to roles that suit them the most, and not try to explore other genres in the name of fulfilling their creativity. That way its a win-win.
it wasnt like other saw movies but it was good enough
Chris rock ruined the movie
WHY DO I HEAR MARTY FROM MADAGASCAR UMM
Kracka lackin'
I'm kinda 50/50 this movie being honest, it didn't have Tobin bell I'm sorry but he's the og jigsaw.
movie was good..some moments with chris was cringey but the plot twist was epic lol
Chris Rock absolutely destroyed Saw,average script,terrible acting all around and just a bad movie.
Just saw the movie.. It's pretty good! I am not disappointed.
One of the guys in this sounds like Martie from Madagascar
I saw a pic of my man in there
CARALEO nunca assisti um filme tão ruim na mrl, os cara parece as criançada de hj em dia, só fica no CARALEO do celular! Judiação de quem vai assistir! Não vale a pena! EVERYBORY HATES CHRIS!😎👍🏻👍🏻
good stuff
saw 9??
Excited to Chris rock in something instead of a voice
His acting skills are amazing but I think he should stick to comedy....his voice alone says that much!!
When technoblade has gremlin children:
He kicked ass as a gangster in Fargo.....I have a new respect for his acting prowess.
old saw series movie's is steel the best
What’s with the voice on the tapes 🤷‍♀️
really wasnt as good as the other Saw movies
Chris rock should not act anymore after that performance
This looks like an amazing movie
I liked this movie, hope it gets a sequel it be interesting.
Could have a director's cut with Chris Tucker replacing Christ Rock, would have been both a fun and horror movie.
سنشاهد 💪🤷‍♂️🔥
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
is this the guy who act as the donkey at shrek?
One of the worst performance of Chris Rock, he should stick to comedy even his voice doesn’t fit this genre!  Regarding the movie is full of bad jokes and non sense things,  it has absolutely nothing to do with the SAW franchising! This is so embarrassing and cringe to watch smh
This movie is a great follow up to the saw legacy, please please please make pt. II
Worst fckin SAW movie ever I cant even imagine wtf was Samuel L Jackson doing in a movie like this. Chris Rock doing some goofy ass grandpa jokes I dont even know to say. The movie was never perfect but you made it even worse...
Dont worry.  Just in case you dont figure out who the killer is right away at the beginning, like I did, theres a part half way through that really gives it away. They really didnt want anyone to be surprised at who it was :P
IS EVERYONE IN THIS MOVIE BLACK? EVEN THE SONG? seriously wtf is this, the Saw series is dead and you killed it.
Do not waist your money on this!!!! It’s so terrible of a movie and is not a saw movie at all!
Samuel Jackson was in the wrong movie! A great actor with all shitty acting
This was by far the worse saw of them all! Jigsaw was even 10 times better than this crap
If you decide to watch this you will get terrible acting in main lead characters. Chris Rick was awful in this! Shit captain actress in his chain of command, a lot of passive SJW events in this movie! Story is good but all the side actors are way better then these terrible actors and actresses
Couldnt Enjoy The Movie With That Marty Voice Of His.
plot was too predictable.
Christ ! I waited so long for a new installment into Saw franchise and this movie sucked.
Why the hell did they choose Chris Rock for this movie ?
His voice do not help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
"When's the last time you saw your father?" When he went to get milk
My bad after realizing watching the movie now I see why and I really should check it before I see it
Save your time. Movie was dumb as hell. I was excited to see Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson but this was just 🥴🥴
SAW 15? cool
I had a HUGE hate-love relationship with Chris Rock in this movie. I loved him being a different character tho compared to his more funny characters.
Chris rock acting and voice almost turned this movie into a comedy horror
Haven’t seen the movie, but I’m predicting that the actor from the handmaids tale is the jigsaw copycat🤷🏽‍♀️ we’ll see if I’m right
is it a comedy?
I didn't like it. How is it possible a young woman like that can be the head of a police department, she was next to useless in her role anyway. The other issue i had was the believeability of the killer policeman. The elaborate contraptions of death would take an almost mastermind of engineering to create. It looks like 'Saw' will return for more police brutality, defund the police virtue signalling and npc i want to eat my shoes, scenes. On the plus side, i thought Chris Rock was pretty good in some scenes.
this so shit lol, thats the problem with movies nowadays they dont know how to make them wtf was this hahaha!!!!
You think it’s over just because I am dead but the games have just begun.
HOW DID I NOT KNOW OF THIS. SAW IS MY FAVORITE FRANCHISE HOW DID I MISS THIS
You know where they all died...when they thought the jig saw killer is dead
Less goo
I just watched it. Very suspensful
*Que filme 📼 bom da porr@ mano pra quem curti suspense tem que assistir!*
In the future I can see the WWE wrestler Undertaker being in a Saw movie or Ben Affleck or Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill or maybe Adam from original Saw film returns.

Cop bashing movie, I’m wondering if BLM or Antifa produced it.
Chris Rock was awful as a detective. I just can't get past his voice.
Garbage, apart from certain death scenes that make you weirded out 😝
Cliché plot, lack of traps, pig's voice was annoying, bad acting of Chris Rock
Chris Rock is terrible actor yoh
its a shit movie specially with chris rock shouting like a lil b i t c h
*Chris Rock was NOT the right choice for this movie, THEY F UP!*
They cast the role for Chris Rock only to make Jigsaw angrier,this is more than enough even for him...
Hit like if you came here after watching Podcast and chill😂😂
Was a nice story but really pathetic acting. What a waste of what could have been an awesome movie apart from some really annoying scenes. Totally regretted watching this movie
I just watched the movie and all i heard is marty's voice in my head  😂 l love chris rock he makes the horror movie worth to watch
Man I hate Chris Rock.
Por favor, qual a opinião dos brasileiros sobre o filme?
They choose a wrong lead role actor..LoL
Famous actors in not so big budget movies after corona. But i will give a try. Pandemic take its toll.
All. I here is a zebra
Looking like se7en part 2.
Expected more tbh. Overall not bad.
a USB is also oldschool a vlog would have been from this time :p can you see the doll from saw vlogging ? :p
It’s gonna be good with Samuel L Jackson
Hey Donkey - Is that You?
I CAN'T BELIVE 21 SAVAGE GOT IN THIS WITH HIS AMAZING MUSIC!!!
I enjoyed the movie. Super happy to see Saw/Spiral continuing. I thought the F word was completely over-used and came off really really cheap though. I don't mind swearing whatsoever, but it was literally in every single sentence from every character especially in the first 30-45 mins. Great movie though. Saw the twist coming, so hopefully if there's a Spiral 2, the twist is more hidden.
I watched this. Nice story but unrealistic. Angies murder is bullshit. 😂😂 how can a murder happened inside of a police station.  No realistic at all!!
When India release ...
Great movie.
whoever wrote this movie have something bad on his mind!
Terrible movie 👎
Movie could’ve been better with a different leading actor… Chris Rock is an excellent comedian but he’s not convincing at all in this type of role… he looks weak and his voice isn’t appropriate for scenes that require certain level of stress and drama. I really wanted to like this movie since the plot is ok (very predictable tho) but it didn’t really got me involved. There’s no real emotions and all the characters are super plain (not even Samuel Jackson got it right) it was like watching a boring bloody comedy.
Liam Neeson was gonna make  a perfect jigsaw voice , imagine him saying "I wanna play  a game"
I feel like Chris Rock should have made Candyman now
I’m just saying the movie was pretty bad I can tell you rushed The movie I also put a little heart into it I know how hard it was to do it but still jigsaw and saw were kind of better  I did like the whole crime in case but it just ended with him getting away Lionsgate did you rush this movie or did you even try but also good movie but still did you even try I know how hard the movie is to make but 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤 did you even try
What the hell is that The whole movie ended what are you got away and he couldn’t  save the Dad The whole movie ended him getting away that was a piece of crap we could end it happy but no that wasn’t even that good but it was a good movie by the way but still you call  The movie ending. Responsibility for the another movie for that because they just left us off I could tell that they rushed it
I cant take chris rock seriously
This is a New Jack movie with POOKIE!!
Watching Chris Rock playing a serious character reminds me to Aubrey Plaza playing Andy's mom in Chucky.
Who can tell me where i can find this movie??
Chris Rock in serious role is really awesome, i think he should start acting in horror movies
well just saw the movie its hella sick u'll hv to be mentally prepared
Looks like detective Butters there got himself a hard case
This movie was so Bad! everything about it, including the acting. I'm surprised Samuel Jackson decided to participate in this mess. This was an insult to the original "saw" movie...Just my 2cents.
The End of the world is coming when casting directors make Samuel L. Jackson  Chris Rocks dad...but the movie looks really good
THE VOICE USED FOR THE PUPPET WAS SOFT NOT GOOD FOR THIS NEEDED LIKE THE PREVIOUS VOICE OF TOBIN BELL.
HOPE THE PRODUCTION TEAM NEXT TIME WILL GET SERIOUS ACTORS LIKE BEFORE FOR THE SAW SERIES, PLEASE DONT UNDERESTIMATE THE  THRILLER OF THIS FILM BY SELECTING JOKERS LIKE CHRIS ROCK
EN COMPARANT À LA VRAIE VUE, C'EST LOIN EN DESSOUS, ET AUCUNE IDÉE POURQUOI L'ACTEUR JOKER COMME CHRIS ROCK A ÉTÉ PRIS POUR UN ACTEUR SÉRIEUX QU'IL NE PEUT PAS ET IL N'A JAMAIS FAIT BEAUCOUP D'ACTEUR AVANT, IL EST BON POUR LE TYPE COMÉDIE, POUR LES FILMS SAW, BESOIN DE GARS COMME TOBIN CLOCHE ETC. FILM D'ÉCHEC TOTAL À CAUSE DE CHRIS ROCK !!!!
COMPARING TO REAL SAW THIS IS FAR BELOW, AND NO IDEA WHY JOKER ACTOR LIKE CHRIS ROCK WAS TAKEN FOR A SERIOUS ACTING WHICH HE CANT AND HE NEVER DONE MUCH ACTING BEFORE, HE IS GOOD FOR COMEDY TYPE, FOR SAW MOVIES, NEED GUYS LIKE TOBIN BELL ETC. UTTER FAILURE MOVIE BECAUSE OF CHRIS ROCK !!!!
Nothing like the saw movies,crap that they associated it with saw.cant stand Chris Rock,sad that they had Samuel l Jackson in this,he is a good actor,if you love the saw movies,this is a massive let down.
The acting is so... questionable.
Big. eye. roll. 🙄Another one? Spiral? Pfff... just stop already.
Saw: Madagascar
Chris Rock in a horror - BooYah!
This a good movie 😂😂
1:55
Chris rock in a serious movie and he's playing a detective! comedy gold!
This was just a ACAB PSA
He did pretty good but I couldn't take him too seriously in the horror movie world but....I'll give him this one
Is Spiral a comedy/parody of the Saw movies? Or is it Chris Rocks attempt to play a serious role?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
This movie is really bad. Filled with bunch of bad actors.
Movie wasn't good at all. Chris rock is not the person for this movie
Good God. Chris Rock as a lead in a horror movie is awkward and doesn't work. Saw franchise jumped the shark with the 3 film, its a dead franchise, leave it alone. Come up with something original already. Why is Samuel in every movie? He can't be the only middle aged black man available in Hollywood.
is the biggest filth of the movie don't forget, nonsense like that should be banned a miserable movie shit with a nasty ending
1:44
Holy shhhhhi i've been waiting for this
R E F U N D
I just hope Chris Rock doesn’t play the next Superman
I am glad they did a spin off, I am not one for spin offs but I feel like saw BADLY needed it

Normal People See: a Spiral Gamers See :  Ubisoft.
Wow this really does not do the previous films justice and I can tell just from the preview.
OK, so I was really looking forward to this movie, especially due to having both Samual L. Jackson and Chris Rock in it - "you wanna play games mother fucker?" - however, I realised early on that it is a Chris Rock movie and had Samuel L. Jackson too, in a similar vien as to how suicide squad is a Will Smith movie, there was far too much comedy in the film for the dark subject, unfortunately when you have a movie with these actors in who are known for a phrase used or the comedy they are related to, it takes away the feel of the movie.  It would have worked better with 'unkowns' like the saw frachise.  It was great to see Cary Elwes in the original line up and Shawnee Smith who are known for other things but not at the top, A list celebrity status at the time which I think helped with the success of the first films.  With the two main actors, already there are expectations before watching in due to their previous work and those expectations were met but for the wrong reasons, it is almost taking the franchise into dark comedy in the way Bride of Chucky did for the Child's Play franchise which is great if that is what you're looking for.  There is nothing wrong with a spin off if done right, I mean, look at Frasier, then look at Joey!  I don't think a TV series would work for the franchise as the TV series can't go as graphic as the movies do.  I won't be watching the sequel if there is one, it took years for Chil'd Play to get back to being a serious horror and then it still failed.  I am not dissing the actors, they delivered a great performance, I think the writing should not have had the comedy elements in there and both actors mentioned can deliver dark, serious performances.  As much as I wanted to hear "you wanna play games mother fucker", I feel it shouldn't have been there.    I also think that even better twist would have been to have Samuel L. Jackson as the antagonist.  Unfortunately, I feel this film, Spiral: From the book of Saw (not to be confused with Spiral 2019), is too much Hollywood.  Thank you for reading, I apologise if anyone has been offended, this is not my intention.  I have been a fan of Saw since the beginning, yes the franchise has had it's ups and downs and this isn't the worst installment but it's not a great start for a spin off either.
bro Chris Rock needs to give up on acting. just finished watching the movie and it was mostly bad because of his acting.
No need to show trailer.. Jst all black.. Crz
watch platform instead
waste of time.
The acting from Chris Rock sucked ass and so did the movie. He should stick to comedies.
Who let Nick out of Gilead 🙄
Chris Rock horrible acting in this movie, actually everyone was bad acting acting. Tons of unnecessary curse words, Horrible movie.
Movie was pure ass
When his rookie partner called the meth dealer a snitch I knew he was the jigsaw killer.
One and a half hour I wasted. Music, sucks. Plot, so simple it became dull. Plot twhist, the most predictable I've seen. Even a fart after tacobell is more unpredictable. As soon as the rookie showed the family picture, i suspected him straight away. Why? Because who the f#*K has his family picture with himself cut out of the picture? I mean look at the picture. It's not even folded. It was cut! And when he was on the phone while the baby is crying... I mean c'mon! I'm  not a father but i had a younger brother and when he was crying and my mom was out of the house, even if i was on the phone i could multi task. Ok, need both hands? Speaker! I won't say everything that made me hate this movie and loose even more time because of it. Chris ramsay on this movie was cool to see though. But yeah, in the end, for me, flop. And i usually don't make "hate comments". I genuinely dissapointed.
Well, in my opinion the direction of the movie was good but the acting sucked, especially from Chris Rock, also, the voice of the main Killer should have been more deeper, not exactly like jig saw but similar
Isn’t that the pedo gate symbol officially confirmed by the FBI?
For anyone wanting to see this but are not sure... GO SEE IT! It is a fresh take on the series while also paying homage to the classics through its cinematography and stylistic editing. This lays ground for a whole new spinoff series.
The voice of the pig is basically the voice tik tokers use in their videos insted of their own. Dialog and lines are cringy af...basically the worst part of Saw, ever, made.
Bad bad bad. Chris rock was terrific however this is just another example of where we are at today. Take a name n make a movie to make a buck cause they know the name will sell.
Great trailer terrible movie!
Did this fly under anyone else’s Nose and there just now finding out ?
I’ll always imagine Marty when I hear Chris Rock’s voice
It’s pretty good to be honest. I wasn’t expecting Chris rock can be that good. Good job
The special effects were fantastic...but the actors sucked big balls!!!
Who's seen it? Is it good?
Yaaay another saw movie 😐
Another psycho sicko movie
This should not be a part of Saw and any way Chris is yelling an over talking most of the movie  the cast look like they're an a newly update version of Hawaii 5-O  only thing that was half way done is the start of the movie so... Good luck with that 😉💯
Maduro con ño de tu Madre
Is dreamcast making a comeback?!
big shit énigma movie not horror movie
That’s by far the worst movie EVER what a waste of time🤦🏻‍♂️
I really wanted to like this movie...but I just couldn't do it.
This was good
If Spiral's voice reminds you of LANCE: THE PULL OUT KING -- you're right.
Rock's voice is sooo good
Great movie but it didn't end well ❌
why on earth chris rock made this film??? no doubt the mortgage and bills....
Once he said it can be anything or anyone I automatically assumed it was him 😂I hope I’m wrong but I’m about to rent it now
Donkey is all I hear lol
Marty?
Saw 1, 2, 3 Spiral. Perfect. The rest su#ks.
This is not a good movie ☹️☹️ Too Disappointed....
wow, what next? sam jackson doing stand up?
This is why I dont eat pork...
This is amazing!
Lol I can’t 😂. I won’t be able to get over chris rock. It just doesn’t feel like it’s going to be scary or intimidating with him playing the lead roll.
I cannot take this seriously with Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson in it. I'm gonna give this a pass. Also milking a dead franchise for money is getting lame and desperate... Big turn off
Not worth the early access, seriously $20 for that new j just watched.. This movie should only be shown in dollar theaters
Oh my, I needed a box of crackers to go with all the “cheese” this movie dished-out!  Holy actor turds Batman!
Jigsaw voice, is from an effeminate male fit for this generation. Doesn't even feel like saw. This was a terrible movie, messing the saw series
Marty! Alex is searching for you!
Not really  a saw movie,  just a detective movie. Really predictable and not true to the SAW  movies. Disappointed to say the least.
Make a flick for a buck!
I can't wait to add this movie to my collection
I dont know why chris decided to make this movie. He probably binged watched the whole saw movies during quarantine, got inspired. Thought he have something special but this movie was too predictable, i already know who the killer is right from the start, even when they tried to make it look like he already died. Its a new movie but with old themes, chris tried to insert his old jokes, its 2021 already, comedy like rock or chapelle have no appeal like how it did in the 90s.
Rush Hour 5.0
Didn't like it
It scares me how good America is at making these horror movies and all the twisted thoughts that goes into these movies
Entertaining and enjoyable watch but I worked out who the killer was and why in the first 20 minutes
This movie was Bad, the acting, the dialogue and to top it off, Chris Rock with his screechy voice trying to be serious 🤦🏽‍♂️...not to mention his weird facial expressions
Everytime he talks, I'm hearing a zebra talking
My Brain keeps expecting something FUNNY from a very serious movie, is it Chris Rock effect??
Putting Chris Rock in a horror movie is like putting the Pope in a porno.
I feel like a lot was removed from the movie, taking away the breathtaking experience. Too many lines in this trailer were not used in the movie, therefore cut as well as a whole trap being cut.
Not sure why the Reviews were below Average to Average, I didn't think it was so bad.  Atleast 6.5/10 and worth a watch.
there is a camera error @ 39:29 minutes in this movie,did anyone notice it?
i really hope the movie is better than the trailer, because im not impressed, and am sad to say that, because i love the saw movies so much. i dont think they picked the right actors for this movie. this is just sad.... btw i do think L. jackson makes a good fit... i am going to watch it tho.... but i dont have high hopes....
Chris Rock is the killer calling it now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Huhu watching it right now. I dont know but everytime the main actor talk i dont look at the screen 😅
When the class clown gets serious    But in this case he sound pretty good
It is worth it to be watched on the big screen. Let's keep alive the cinema 🙏🏼
Saw the movie, and I'm pretty pissed off about the ending
saw 1-8 are amazing. I dont even know what this movie tries to be. It's way too focused on the police part, not enought and too short traps, the twist was obvious 10 minutes into the movie... I dont know how to say it, its just not a good movie.
Chris Rock’s acting is awful 🤣😂.. his facial expressions are awkward
In every fucking movie that a black person is playing the main character there is always a goddamn Hip Hop song. Why don't they add some Ragtime and make him dance while they're at it.
They should have put Denzel or someone else I’m not hating but that’s not a detective voice for me
I just can't take this seriously...
The casting couldn't be worse
Thank Christ for the mute button, hearing 21 Savage was brutal! I miss the way rap used to sound.
This movie sucks the movie went to fast you can tell what going to happen next
I'm a BBBBIIIIGGGGG FAN of Saw. Biiiiiiigggggg fan of Samuel L Jackson... Jesus! That was easily the worst SAW I've watched. Acting was soooooo bad. I mean Chris Rock wasn't gonna scare anyone. The story was trash. I deserve a refund
Most horrible performance I’ve seen in a while. CR is a cringe drama/action actor. His voice and his shit eating grin does not work.
I can't help the laugh every time you trying to be serious. This is going to be the funniest scary movie ever
When the original saw music came on it sent chills up my body.
Movie story was good but the actors are so babies very annoying acting but the fact is even babies can do better acting than them except S.jackson I wonder if the actors even realize they are acting in a movie😌
GAS
can't wait for Jerma to see this movie   make your choice
Saw 46 lost in Madagascar
What else? Adam Sandler?
Its difficult to get past Chris Rocks voice. To be fair that’s my problem
What the world needs now is some PO PO poetic justice.
Just saw the movie. Wasn't what i was expecting from a SAW movie, but nevertheless, the creators can give themselves a round of applause, would definetly recommend it, worth watching
ZEBRA - '' How did you get in here ? '' Samuel L Jackson - '' You forget who the landlord is ? '' ZEBRA - '' Yeah but that doesn't give you the right to walk in here anytime you want. Renters got rights. '' Samuel L Jackson - '' You start paying some rent you can get some rights. ''
His partner Schenk is the killer.
It's good to see Chris Rock in something new.
It better be good bruh cause I LOVE SAW
i don't recommend this movie waste of time worst movie ever
Dude the killer got away
Watched last night. It was ok, not bad just ok. It needed more and was short. Chris rock was spot on though!
Seen it. 3/10  Trash movie... idiotic rap music, drug bust scenes... Chris Rock cannot act as a detective, amateur mistakes during filming, obvious killer, horrible saw voice... doesn't seem like a horror more like a comedy.
I cn't wait to c @ChrisRock present us wth his versatility nd/r crossovr frm Comedy. It seems like it's gonna b a heck of a performance nd extremely entertaining.  Tht tks a lot of courage, confidence nd talent.  Gud job, Chris 🙏🏾👏🏾
chris rock is too funny to be in a saw movie
Chris Rock was awesome and showed that he can be so much more than just funny. But this movie was way too woke. It seemed like they just wanted to show cops getting killed with a message behind it. And way way way too obvious. This was as bad as an M Night Shyamalan movie. But again loved Chris Rock. This is not like the other saw movies where u will be genuinely surprised.
I thought it was a good movie for a saw movie it did what I expected! 7/10
Just watched it. Terrible movie. Half-assed plot, dialogue full with comic relief that just comes of as cringy rather than funny, and Chris Rock is horribly miscast.
worst film ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
me: a dream smp stan   also me: *technoblade*
Fantasticaly forgettable. 3/10
Chris rock is shockingly bad in this. Raspberry award should be on the way. Or is it racist now
Even from this trailer, i already get the funny vibe from Chris Rock.. 😂😂
I saw the face of Samuel Jackson and decided to watch and I've realised that I have made a mistake.
Chris Rock never been horror movie before but o well lets get over it and lets play with new killer
Very very good movi one of thé n'est Saw, good story....god bless Floyd
Holes in this movie, 1/2 was plot 1/2 was acting, ouch.
Ghettofying the saw franchise now? Does Hollywood have anyone left who says "dude that's a terrible idea." Or are they all yes men?
Saw this trailer and realised I had way too much ketchup on my grilled pork...
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
Shit movie.
Looks terrible.
Can't help but laugh 🤣
I don’t get how the twist was predictable ?

Currently watching spiral and I cant take Chris Rock serious. 🤣
Nah...I just watch it, I am a huge fan of Saw....Chris did an ok job, felt he was pushing it to hard, serious roles dont go with him, you see Samuel L Jackson like 5 min in the movie, the plot was weak...Saw based, but you see it coming, it lacked that unexpected factor, like the other Saw movies where all is revealed at the end, in this was like yeah I knew that already...I rather watch all Saw movies again than to have to watch this again, its a forgettable movie.....and in the gore side, amm also weak hope they dont go for the second part and rather do another Saw movie....20 millions on this? and dont start me with the voice of the new killer....cringe!!
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SAMUEL JACKSON DIED IN MOVIE 😂
just finished watching the movie. So awesome
Yeah. IDK, I switched off in the middle of the 'Hox Wax' trap. Chris Rock gave it a good shot but just couldn't nail it. Perhaps not his fault because the writing and dialog was terrible. Early on i was thinking are they really going to do the cop getting chewed out by his boss routine. Sure enough it was the "Im partnering you with the rookie" trope. Something so cliched that you only ever see it in parodies now. With each trap I just kept thinking 'I really don't want to see another torture porn movie ever'. I enjoyed the original Saw (if thats possible) and even movies like 'Hostel' and 'I Spit On Your Grave' but the world is horrible enough theses days and its getting worse. Give he something that at least makes me think or makes me feel better. I just can't do these movies anymore. Movies that turn pain into spectacle without having anything else to say. I guess I grew up.
Look how they massacred my boy
Dam
It must be easy to write the script to these kind of movies when nearly all sentences include FU, F this, F that ... But maybe its done for a 15 year old who think reality is fake and movies real. And then the always screaming detective. NOOP, that aint good, just tiresome. 👎
i just finished the movie  its trash waste of time
the black guy officer has new partner and hes the killer
OMG Nick from Gilead is here
Well....    ... if you miss this movie, you ain't missing much.
This was absolutely GARBAGE!
FILM ini jalan cerita nya kek teteng, yg bikin TOLOL, gampang di tebak dan ending yang buruk..
One of the worst movies i ever watched! I prefer to think SAW series ended... Tobin Bell's work was a masterpiece.
I recently watched all the Saw movies. Seeing this gave me the chills. I hope Chris won't disappoint. I really mean no disrespect, I love him and watched everything he put out there, from stand up to movies, but can't picture him in a horror movie. Let's hope I'm mistaking.
Good movie but bad actor
Every time I hear Chris Rock yell something, all I can think of is him yelling "no sex in the champagne room"
i have seen the movie in the movie theaters yesterday .. it’s CRAZYYY , %100 RECOMMENDED
ow common you combine saw with Chris Rock please  do not do this
"when was the last time you've seen your father?" My father left before I was born.. wow, jigsaw. I know you're a psycho, but that was mean.
bad movie, don't waste your time
This feels like an SNL skit
Bagus SAW ato ini ya?
Officer tenpenny!
first - to all the people unfamiliar with Chris Rock taking on a serious role, i HIGHLY recommend Fargo season 4. He kills it.  but this ... i just watched the first thirty minutes and it was so bad I had to turn it off. Rock, Minghella, and Jackson are good, of course, but it's like they spent ALL their money on those three and didn't have anything left to hire an even somewhat decent supporting cast or writers, etc.
wow this was horrible lol
Spiral: From the books of Madagascar
Afro Circus, Afro Circus, Afro Polka dot, polka dot, polka dot Move it!
I just watched this at theater's today. It wasn't that great. But is was better than some of the previous, Saw movies.
id love to see chris rock with kevin hart on this kind of movie.
Chris just lacks that.. oompth when it comes to acting
Man the "do you want to play a game" voice ain't even intimidating, the voice of the bad guy literally sounds like a bisexual vegan hipster...
The “scary” voice they used for Jigsaw sounds cringe asf
why is Chris Rock such a horrible actor? anyone?
PLEASE STOP PUTTING A TRAILER BEFORE THE TRAILER!
i hope this movie is just as good as the others Darren directed! especially with no Tobin Bell. Please live up to the trailer
Can't take it seriously with Chris rocks voice lol. This movie is already a flop.
Should have get the avengers, Ironman can solo the entire case.
i watched this movie yesterday and its not reall that good
This was shit and the plot was so see through as for  Chris Rock's acting it was pathetic 2/10
This had a lousy ending
Among us movie looks good
Why?😂🤣
That was good, enjoyed the saw series.
ya i just SAW it was the worst it impossible to take Chriss Rock seriously ...kept picturing a giraffe... waiting for a joke all along lol and his face cant...well he just cant .
Chris Rick doing this movie was horrible idea.  Stupid story about dirty cops  Waste of time  Horrible movie  Destroyed the whole trilogy of saw
Samuel L Jackson is going to kick ass in this movie. This is an exciting addition to the franchise that I think might actually be.... good? Oh no
That was a great movie. With this many sequels, I didn't think it could be done.
Why make this garbage? Let the franchise die already..
Worst decision ever to cast Chris Rock lol It's just too immersion breaking but maybe kids who don't know him can still enjoy it.
really christ rock in horror film.  da fuck  not good
The word "SAW" brought me to view. fr. cape Town.
Is this shot in my home town ?  Minneapolis
Wrong actors for this film
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
This looks terrible
Worst Movie stop making this kind of fucking movie.
se esse filme for tao ruim quanto o trailer vtnc
Humanity is in trouble when they start to enjoy sadism as entertainment. Horrible movie. boycott.
Bein a RAT is in police job description...they ALL fkn rats LMAO
Do you wanna play a game?)
Just watched it. Trust me, don't waste your time with this shit.
When the zebra's in the zone,leave him alone....What a damn twist ending..shitttt
look up the spiral logo according to the fbi.  weird man.
from the teaser trailers i fucking thought it was a comedy movie lolololol

I know I'm not the only one who started bumping when the 21 Savage track came on in the background lmao
Where can I watch on internet?
Just saw the movie! ... VERY diabolical - and true to the entire Saw series.  Lots of "twists and turns" that you won't figure out ahead of time.  The "gore" was incredibly realistic ... enough so that a "feeling of dread" encompassed me several times.  5 STARS +
The movie what’s great but the voice of the killer what’s bad but it might be my favorite saw movie because of Chris rock
Good lord that's alot of sequels
This movie The Conjuring and A Quiet Place II   all look very good for horror fans.... ; - )
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
dude i'd actually put this movie in my summer bucket list
I’ll admit, Chris Rock gave a pretty good performance.
Who has a USB drive these days?
Just seen this tonight. Chris Rock actually killed that role 💯🔥 Y'all gotta see it.
I didn’t even know this was a thing, saw used to be my FAVORITE thriller movies in high school, I was excited AF for jigsaw to come out but that was TRASH I  might see this hopefully it’s better
Is this on prime
Movie wasn't that good 😔
Great movie. Wish they had more traps. Chris rock did a good job!
I love Samuel L. Jackson.
maybe 🤔 this one’s a good show for you cooler
Dope ass movie 🍿
I CANT FUCKING WAIT TO WATCH IT
It’s lame that they what happens to the train guy
Somebody should make a movie....about how bad this movie was
this is a great movie honestly. dont listen to the negative reviews.
Your Turning Mean Very Fast
Just saw this and thought it wasnt as good as the other ones. Mostly because Cramer was so badass and the new guy that plays it is god awful at it. Cant believe thats who they casted for that
Sounds like an effeminate Kylo Ren.
Chris and Samuel playing father and son they're 17yrs apart in age!!
No I don’t see him in action
- bad story, the director got complicated, they talk a lot, rude character, things changed, this movie is a mockery of saw.
I can't wait to see this movie, but I CAN wait to see Chris Rock...  FFS, Chrisk Rock?   C-H-R-I-S R-O-C-K?  In a Saw movie?  Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
Why does it seem like all the Saw movies take place in Gotham City?
all i see is that damn zeebra...smh
I’m going to see this tonight
odd tv machine: call me
Chris rock still sounds like a comedian lol
Happy Bastards
Spiral Still Matrix
Still matrix
chris rock trying to act tough and cant.he's so...i dont know....kid comedian like.
Racist Critics: *THERE SHOULD ONLY BE WHITE PEOPLE!!!*
I love the handcuff scene where you could see him thinking, "WTF they want me to do with this saw?  Saw off a limb?  Heeeeeeeeeck no.  Let me pick these cuffs with a piece of metal"
Isn't that Dreamstime logo? :D
Just saw it, not really worth a watch imo. Too predictable and you cannot take any of the actors seriously.
Can't wait to see a spiral number two
This movie was good as hell
Saw this yesterday, not a fan. The traps were boring, not very gory at all, and the voice of the killer is HORRIBLE. It literally sounds like a girl trying to talk like a scary man. It's literally funny. I found the whole movie boring and predictable.
They put the spiral 21 savage in the trailer😂
It’s ruined
You think you will walk away you think the games are over just because I'm dead I promise my work will continue.
Ooh Hoo Hoo, SNAP! I can hardly wait to watch.
Anybody saying chris rock cant be serious. Check out the latest season of Fargo. Amazing performance!
i can see a lot of chris rock meme potential just from this trailer
I can't not laugh at Chris Rock

21 SAVAGE LESGOOO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I’m gon give it a chance even though I don’t think Chris is suited for this role 😂
I m a superfan of saw
I love Chris rock☺️
i don't watch new movies I'm a old movies type of gal but because I love Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson I'm going to watch this movie
Okay so I’m throwing this idea out there about a good, loyal addition to the Saw universe. We’re like 9 movies in.   How do we continue John Kramer’s mission and legacy without the bullshit of “maybe he’s still alive” or “there’s additional tapes/evidence undiscovered” and Properly expand the Saw universe from here?  We’ve gotta stop using all of the flashbacks, maybe leave the new cop storyline open-ended, (they probably won’t since Saw X has been announced) and focus on something that’s already been alluded to.   A cult of Jigsaw.   Kramer was training all sorts of apprentices. The good ones were Dr. Gordon (Saw) and Logan (Jigsaw), and from Jigsaw we learn there is a community out there that’s fascinated with Kramer, his games, and his ideology. Hell, even that one girl in Jigsaw was a big fan of the traps and learning all she could about it.   So, moving on from Kramer’s convoluted storyline, moving away from the new cop storyline, we’ve got a new series of murders going on, and a cult.  This cult will be a bunch of fanatics who follow Kramer’s intentions religiously. They want to be the successors and bring change to the world.  Hmm... okay so I’m coming up with this on the fly.  The police think this cult is out there killing random innocent people who have no real dirty backgrounds or scandals, which surely doesn’t fit the motif of Kramer or the ideology.  Meanwhile, either Gordon, Logan, or both are busy running their own games and training up a new apprentice, and they smell something fishy in this new cult.  The cult is doing it all wrong, and recklessly, the same way Amanda and Hoffman were initially doing it for personal gain.   So here’s the first question, the leaders of the cult have to initiate new members, right?  How will they do it? They will offer people a chance to join if they endure their own trap, the idea being that if they are willing to suffer, and find their will to live, and survive their trap, then they can be “reborn.”   So Dr. Gordon and/or Logan will need the dirt on the cult.  They will discover that the guys at the top of the cult have not endured their own traps (like Bobby Dagen), and they just want to murder new initiates for sport, and if someone does survive, well they’re in the cult now.   So these murders have actually been people trying to get into this cult, and failed.   At the end of the film, one or both of Kramer’s actual apprentices put the leaders of this new cult into their own games.  None survive.  I want to break that staleness of the multi-movie storylines that jump back and forth in the timeline and actually sit down to create one good mystery. Like, in the beginning, it’s this big, shadowy underground organization and you actually think they’re out there running games on the public, so you only have as much understanding as the police investigating this monstrous conspiracy.   Then.. you get a glimpse into the inner workings on the cult and it looks fucking brilliant.   Next you get the perspective of Kramer’s real apprentice(s) looking into it and seeing all’s not good in the hood.   So the whole movie will allude to this super secret underground cult that’s actually making moves in the public psyche and looks as if they’re carrying on Kramer’s legacy, when in reality it’s a bunch of dudes recruiting and tricking young, impressionable, obsessive fans into trying out the sadistic traps they create, and if some survive, “shiiit, you’re in!”   And Kramer’s actual apprentices are like  “Oh hi there, bitches. Let’s show you how it’s Really done.” 😂  It’s basically the real successors vs the posers.
Don’t listen to the critics this movie was great!
See you at James in Dead Meat this year!
saw it. its trash. chris rock died
I’ve never seen a SAW movie. Do I need to before seeing this?
i kept thinking this was a skit from key and peele

Chris Rock and a scary twisted it film its going to snow in Memphis today. This looks interesting. I never seen Chris Rock and a movie like this which means he's development his craft and stepping outside the box like Tom Hanks and Jim Carey did when they started out.
This looks legit
Is this a comedy?
Are they serious with this? Chris Rock playing a detective but really just playing Chris Rock? I can't take him seriously with that classic intonation of his.
this movie was “everybody hates chris” the movie
Bad casting with rock. All I see is new jack city crackhead. “This shit be callin me”
It seems like Sam L goes to do a scene for one movie in one studio, then goes to the studio next door to a scene for another film, and on and on it goes...!! My favorite Sam L Jackson is Darth L Jackson...for real!!!
Sometimes when I hear there is a new SAW I want the twist to be that all of the movies were a dream and Jigsaw decides its not worth it and really does just shoot himself in that damn bathroom.
James a Janise: aw shit here  we go again
...Chris Rock?  What? I mean, HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTT, now I have to watch this fucking thing.
Can't wait too see this movie I loved the saw movies is this a one off film or is it going to get some sequals
I’d rate it 4/10
Ima see it tomorrow after work. If it's good, I'll stream it 1st day its available.
Is this saw?
Here bc of 21 savage. Heard it when it first came out, just never took the time to watch the trailer lol. Def going to watch this weekend
This looks sick!! Cant wait to see it. - horror nerd
why didnt Mace just use the force to discover the identity of jigsaw?
is there anywhere i can watch this movie online?
how scary is this pls let me know if u have seen it scale of 1-10 thanks
I think I've never seen Chris Rock in a serious role
Lame, this ain't an Uzumaki film.
So the killer is a cop right?
I keep thinkin Marty!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How is this movie? Seems predictable based on this trailer. Any fun?
oh shit..... OH SHIT.... No movie, has ever, or will ever surprise me the way SAW did, with their ending. I AM A SUPERFAN

Clearly the comment section hasn’t seen Fargo season 4🗣
The current cancel culture has killed comedy so movies are the next best thing.
Why does the new Jigsaw sound like Kermit the Frog?
Just watched this - the storyline was amazing, couldn't keep your eyes off the screen. BUT DAMN this shit is revoltingly horrifying...
Jim Gaffigan became a struggling taxi driver to a baby kidnapper in a drama movie, Jim Carey became an amnesiac crazy killer in 23, and now this.
Can't wait for this
Chris Rock gets put in the saw traps by his dad for wasting 12 cent worth of milk back in 1998
it woulda made more sense if instead of samuel l jackson it was about chris rock's character's brother played by chris tucker.
Does he get to say in this movie “but I hear it calling my name”! 😃
His dad died at the end
I'm in!!
Reads more like a thriller mystery, sort of like Seven, rather than a horror movie. Still looks interesting.
21
I just finished watching it and gotta say it was pretty good I easily predicted who the killer was but his reason for killing was actually decent twist
Worst movie ever...
Wasn't this one of the subplots of Gotham season 4 ?
Jigsaw is creepy as
Chris Rock trying to be Denzel now
A Saw movie without Tobin Bell, is not Saw movie...
Why does jigsaw sound like a lady boy?
Где русские?
I'm definitely going to have to see this because Chris Rock is a funny guy
Disappointed from this movie alot... It wasn't saw at all... Totally different from saw series.... A totally flop movie.....
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Being honest with y'all this movie was pretty good. From my opinion it is. I hope there's a sequel
If u follow the Saw franchise within the last 35 minutes of the Movie you will figure out who the killer is. The movie is meh and I hope it just gets better
Really bad casting choice for the lead character
I’m bored so I’m go see it today 🤣 oh if it’s stupid y’all sure will know I’m good judgment of movies I love watching all kinds of movies 😂🤷🏾‍♀️
I liked the movie up until the last 10 minutes. I won't watch it again not even when it's free on YouTube.
The pig is the killer as always the pig is a politician in human disguise 😄🤣😅😆😄we should kill all the politician pigs and thus will be a better world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=190s
wow SAW sequel or prequel, here
AND THE JESUITS ARE OPENING THE PORTALS OF DEMONS "THE SPIRAL"
His voice just doesn't fit the movie
Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson were some great picks. I never thought I'd laugh as many times as I did during a horror movie. Also couldn't imagine anyone but Marty throughout the movie LMFAO
Can’t take him serious 😂
so this is a remake of saw movies? i'll pass
were can wach it
Lol I can't take that man serious they should've chose someone else 😂
I’ll be going to watch this film simply because of Chris Rock lol! I want to see how he pulls off this movie
It’s VERY frickin’ weird seeing Chris Rock being serious for once.  EDIT: *DAMN!* I didn’t expect to reach “2.2K” likes!
Never knew I would see Marty in a Saw movie.
this was such a great movie guys!!!
Uzumaki
Who the hell is Chris Rock?  All I can hear is Marty's voice
They totally screwed this series up. The voice on the tape doesnt sound right either.
This movie was soo bad Jesus Christ. Hands down one of the woorssst movies I have ever seen. They took a giant steamy sht on jigsaws name.
This movie looks good.I want to see it. But it does remind me of that movie Seven.
William Schenk is the killer (the white cop)

Yo guys, back in 2006, I made a parody of Saw that is politically incorrect featuring an awesome African American young rapper trapped in the game of SAWED. See the full movie of The Dumbest Horror Flick Ever #TDHFE on my channel for some laughs of our parody that actually fits with Spiral! - https://youtu.be/5ls06vZaxak
Is anyone else kinda sad about not having the old modulated voice? Like, I preferred when it was just deep, it feels like they’re trying too hard to make it seem like something else.
Reminds me of when Number 23 first came out... People: Shocked 😲😳
Chris Rock did not belong in this movie at all. he was so out of place and other time he look wasted. Chris Rock is wash up, stay retired dude. The movie could have been better if Chris Rock was in it.
the man with the blue lips @2:08 was that even in the movie?
Chris Rock's acting from the trailer doesn't look convincing at all, looks like he is trying to be funny instead. I suppose it's just the voice?
Sounds like you had multi dollar budget.
Shout out to Chris Ramsay cosplaying Eifel 65 at 2:03
Wait where logan and billy wth
1:14 - 2:15
At first I thought it was trailer of  spiral 2020 until I clicked it's spiral saw I was like didn't they release this spiral 2020 movie why are they releasing it's trailer now
Fuck… SAW gone Hollywood 🤦🏽‍♂️
I can’t unsee him as a lion 🤣
I dont like horror movies but this movie looks pretty good
Spoiler alert Samuel Jackson dies at the by a bunch of cops happy days 😊😃 overall the movie 8/10
No one can take Chris Rock seriously with his voice lmao...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=162s
Раша тут?
That voice for the Jigsaw copycat sounds like a woman. She’s asking when he last saw his father, sounds to me she wants that child support back pay.
Chris Rock playing this role is like watching the Wayans Brothers do  Dramatic Romance
I can’t take this serious if Chris rock is in it
oh dear lord.. worst "saw voice" ....
Of course Mr Jackson is his father.  Who else would it be 😄🙌
What's the name of the song at 1:20?
No spoilers, but the movie is absolutely incredible 🤯
best saw movie in my opinion gorey, sad, nail biting, scary. I thought Chris rock was a good portrayal of a detective in a saw movie hands down best movie of 2021
Great to see Chris Rock having a big comeback 👏
Anticop propaganda
alo kad ce biti ovo u bioskopu jel zna neko
2:04 Chris Ramsay fans 👇🏻
I have seen all the part of saw series except "Spiral"
who is here after Chris Ramsy
Do you have to watch the previous saw films to watch this one?
I like the look of this, but It's come at a point in time where Saw has been dragged out so much that i really can't figure out if i want to bother.
Chris Ramsay fan here
Dailyvlog@Willy Willy
All I hear is Marty
This movie was soooo good imo. For me best the best saw movie out of them. I liked the more investigative side to it!
i don't feel scared im just waiting to laugh but that never happens
Mmmm omg Chris rock is looking so sexy in his age. Great movie he has always played well as a serious actor
Wait…. I have to go to the movies to watch this??? I can’t just rent it on On Demand?? I’m COVID spoiled now! 😩
I hear Chris Rock voice and think of the Blame Game 😂
don  t  waste  your  money  on  this  movie  it  sucks  badly
So basically this is Among us but in real life? Someone is really sus.
Spiral- 10/10   I’ve just left the cinema and I may have just watched my favourite addition to the saw franchise,great story,great traps and a fantastic cast all came together to make a really solid movie.. I will definitely be rewatching more than once.. truly was blown away by the movie..
Who recognises Nick from The handmaid's tale series ?   Ok🥴 just me
I hope it's as good as the book...
And I swear to god if they really have the card domino and poppy the performer mask and Lily gonna freak out
No think about it this new pig pig of a puppet is actually really stupid it’s just they took away my boy l billy the puppetAlso they ruined the pig mask I was so normal from the old movies
First the black man does comedy now is experience horror movies what the fuck is going on right now hold the hell did this happen goodness I am so confused that’s just wild and stupid but why I’m a little stupid like stupid bitch and It’s just a joke I’m not that stupid but it’s just like a song that I made up ripped off goodbye long
I love me some chris rock and sam jackson, but they picked 4 leads, all nonwhite, as protagonists. They then painted the entire police force of ALL whites as either complete morons or actual antagonists. This movie might be good, but don't be fooled- this is just another cog in the forced diversity wheel.  Look at the IMDb page for this movie. 90% of the main cast is nonwhite. You either agree with me, or think I'm a racist. That's what this country has come down to.  Do you really want the country to be one big diversity hire? Imagine pilots being that... Not based of merit or qualification, rather your skin color. Lot of crashed planes headed our way...
Chris Rock is a decent comedian.  Who the fuck cast him for this?!
Anyone else scared to watch trailers because it ruins the movie a little ?   I stopped it at 15 seconds, will For sure be seeing this movie
it was terrible lmao
Never thought i'd see another Saw movie produced tbh
I hope the soundtrack will be fire like the ones from 2004-2010
If Adam Sandler was the killer, just stop making movies, we’ve reached the pinnacle
can someone please talk about 1:17. Its a shot of Minneapolis MN. Hello? corrupt cops...police brutality...2020
I can't be the only person that hears Chris Rock and sees a Zebra 🤣🤣
Can't take him seriously 🤣
Black characters taking over all the white movies now huh lol jk anyways movie was not bad but the I wana play a game voice is horrible sounds stupid lol
I just saw this tonight, and while I can’t say it’s the best movie I’ve ever seen, it’s still pretty damn good. Not as gory as the other Saw movies, but the jump scares and plot twists are insane.
Here before the SAWcon comments😭
Nopppppppppeeeee
For anyone planning to watch this; it’s very gory compared to the rest but all and all it’s pretty good
wait why is the pig mask dude there amanda is dead
This movie was horrible. I haven’t wanted to walk out of a movie in a very long time but this one almost forced my hand
I just saw this movie in theaters and i loved it i thought it was another great saw flim great cast great story Chris rock did great in a horror flim worth seeing
is samuel l jackson even old enough to be chris rocks dad 😭
The Billy laugh sounds like flowey...
Marty in some deep shit now
Its not saw its pig saw ha ha
I’ve watched this trailer like 20+ times, I’m so excited for this fucking movie. Got my tickets for a showing today!
They really gnna make these forever, then reboot it
Much love Lionsgate!!!!!!!! Chris Rock!!!!!!

Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson telling Black people to take the experimental biological pathogen the vaccine that's not a vaccine they're selling their souls for an entertainment career SMH
Love this movie!! OMG I didn't think it'd be my 2nd favorite Saw movie!! :))
What next? A sequel to "A Nightmare on Elm Street" starring Jackie Chan?
This movie was TOOOOO good bro
Bro I’m not gonna enjoy this movie while thinking of a black zebra the whole time
Just SAW this movie yesterday it was actually really good and Chris did a fantastic job I recommend this movie 💯
Funny the pedo symbol all over this movie.
SAW: the Blaxploitation
That’s some cold shit
the moment chris rock raises his voice even a little, it already sounds funny 🤣
Any malayalees
Pookie is back!
i can’t take marty from Madagascar in a horror movie
This movie was great beginning to end a must watch !!!
Didn’t know New Jack City was getting a sequel. Pookie still smoking that crack! Might have to check this out…
Saw the movie and Chris was 👍 great.
i’m going to see this today 😭🌚
https://youtu.be/XaWeQYOGxzI
Please some help me with a link online so I can watch
I just saw it and its not a 3/10 like IGN said it was
Movie release date ???
my boy osmosis
For those of y’all wondering, yes this movie is 2 hours of Chris Rock yelling every line lmao
Really bad movie made even worse by Chris Rock
Sorry but chris rock is not a good actor.
Great movie with good attention to detail. Chris Rock, Samuel Jackson and Awesome job adding Chris Ramsay (best YouTube puzzle solver). This was really close to the first Jigsaw in quality.
Fuck yeah my boy morte from warzone
"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka!" (1998)
Man saw this movie yesterday it no where near as good as this movie trailer makes it out to be if your expecting something like saw one and two or anything decent it ain't here i feel like if they use the saw name to sell this movie id say to anybody wait till it goes on streaming
Osmosis jones in real life.
Best part of the trailer and most beleivable .. Chris Ramsey's Scream 🤟
And you thought Billy was just a creepy puppet guess again.
This movie is going to be funny and scary at the same time because of Chris Rock😂
2:07 great movie but you need to get a better person doing your trailers because of this it made me know for sure what was going on and kinda ruined the movie for me.
I had the copycat Jigsaw Killer pegged when I saw the trailer and I was right. Very underwhelming twist to be honest. In comparison to the other Saw movies.
so Now people sayin biggie smalls got Assassinated. people sayin Tupac got Assassinated.........JFk got Assassinated  Martin Luther King got Assassinated ...Tupac and Biggie then niggas GOT SHOT.  LOL  CHRIS ROCK
stop with these moden saw movies becuase they are ruining the franchise as they arent as good to near
The killer is shown in this trailer
This is supposed to be a horror movie from the book of Saw but the sound mixer made it Goofy and Chris rock didn't help
Everybody hates....
Idk bout this one. Looks like an indie film at best so far
I can’t watch this without hearing Marty from Madagascar
I’m only watching to see Chris rock try to play a serious character. This will be interesting
Spirals??? *uzumaki flashbacks*
Yes! Now were talking 💯
The trailer is 10 times better than the actual movie
This movie was good and chris played his role amazing 10/10 movie
Sam Jackson and Chris Rock of all fucking people starring in a Saw movie. These are strange times.
There will be Justice served!
Disappointed, this movie ruined the whole series, they should’ve never revealed the jigsaw and they should’ve focused on the killing more than the police brutality and stuff, only 4 deaths in this movie, don’t recommended tbh
I watched this movie yesterday I enjoyed it a lot       *there’s quite a bit of gore so be careful
It's going to be really hard to take Chris Rock seriously 😕 Not sure I'll like him in anything that isn't a comedy!
The officer said the same thing “tell me detective banks , when’s the last time you saw your father” , and at the end jigsaw said the same exact thing with his father strapped up 👀 am I on to something???
This is so cheesy?!
SPOILER ALERT: Samuel L. Jackson dies in this movie!  Me: Uh, he dies in every movie he's in. What makes this movie any different?
Officer Tenpenny getting what he deserves
Great Movie excellent acting: Chris Rocked it
I couldn’t believe the ending of this at all
This is a great movie I watched it already I give it a 10/10
I'm I the only one that can't take this shit serious at all with Chris Rock in it?  Man I thought it was a parody or something. 😂
a saw movie with chris rock and samuel l jackson with a soundtrack from 21 savage and gunna? it’s gonna be so funny
Remind me of Red John from the mentalist. The symbol I mean
Sad you got rid of Billy. Was the best character in Saw.
Samuel L Jackson and Chris Rock.....the New Pulp Fiction Horror team...
Oh shiiiiiit
I thought this was a GREAT movie #SpookySznYearRound
Ill tell you my reaction after i watch Spiral (21st May)

Went to go see it with the family tonight !!!! It was so good 😊
oh more woke trash..
No cap this movie was trash lol
Just seen it!! Worth going to see huge plot twist unexpected. 😊
I just got out of the theater from watching this, man it is crazy, mind bending, also the kills are crazyyy realistic
the ending of this movie got me so triggered
Did this trailer feel like an SNL skit to anyone else? 🤣
Some one is a huge SEGA Dreamcast fan!
I kept thinking of Chris Rock in Dogma while watching this BUT I think he could be outstanding and same with the movie if they all get it right
I don't ever recall Chris Rock in a serious roll. I think he has the ability to pull it off tho.
Pogggg. It's the 14th of may
Seen spiral last night an I mean wow the movie is A1 top shelf👌🏿🪂
My friend wants me to come with him to see this tonight. It looks pretty terrible.
Jesus Christ how big is this franchise
Sounds good
Sega Dreamcast
how do I tell my mom I wanna go see this movie without telling my mom I wanna go see this movie
21
The way that Chris Rock says "we're gonna tear this city apart" is so satisfying for some reason
no f way
I’m watching this.
eehh i donnu about this. One thing that did the Saw franchise for me was that they had alot of unrecognisable actors
Okay but in Canada, ONT where can we find it to watch?!?! im actually upset no movies, Landmark, Cinplex is open or have it for rental to watch at home, where can i watch it :( ?
I thought jigsaw was dead, well you still alive
Bruh I kept waiting for Chris Rock to make a joke or do something funny
I love saw, but this shit is going to be DOGSHIT
اليوم نزل الفلم، الزبدة اذكر قبل سنة كنت انتظر هالفلم وبقوة عشان واحد يشتغل بطاقم العمل، لكني نسيت مين بالضبط.
A Saw movie with big name talent. Interesting.
never would i have ever expected 21 savage to drop an EP for a horror movie
anyone know what song played during the robbery scene?
i really feel like chris is going to be amazing in this movie
Can't wait to see Nick!🥰#THT aka Max Minghella
So hyped
Can’t wait love the saw series ohhh and is 21 savage I hear
It’s gonna be Chapelle and Bobby Lee as the killers lol 😂
Just pay attention to the words people say.
It was decent Samuel l Jackson kinda made the movie
Ima just watch this movie on mute
Bruh his voice I can’t 😂😂 it’s to funny
Everybody hates Chris
Looks ok.
They should of featured the song Smoke Screen by night Lovell because at the very beginning he says “spiral” 🕸 his voice is very menacing so it would of sounded sick in this.
All I hear is Marty
Marty on the case
who is going to see it tommorow?
Chris rock? For a horror movie? Idk
Ouhhhhhhh this finna be a good ass movie
This is giving me such mixed signals... Like, it's clearly Saw, but the tone seems so different. Or maybe it's just the way the trailer was made, but, it looks good, just a bit off from what the previous ones have been. Definitely excited to see it though, don't get me wrong.
Chris Rock in a drama? I'm sold.
Can’t wait for the shrek memes to come out after this.
This is just a big ass Dreamcast commercial
*high pitch voice* "IT COULD BE ANYWHERE, IT COULD BE ANYONE!"
I honestly thought it was gonna be a live action Uzumaki
This is real????? will be released in theaters tomorrow ????
BROOOOO ITS COMING TOMMOROW WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTtT

We all want to see this for Chris Rock having a serious performance.
Whos dumb idea was it to have Chris rock as the main character in a saw movie
I never clicked on this video wth
''so tell me detective banks...when is stranger things season 4 gonna be released''
I just hope it is as good as the others with the traps and gore
I can't take Chris serious on this one lmaoo
I can't take his voice serious hahahhaa.
I just can’t picture Chris Rock anything but funny
looks bad
I thought they defunded the police.
Why does Chris Rock Look like Fifty Cent in the thumbnail?
I cannot wait to see this!
The new disguised voice sounds dumb
Great movie. Bad / evil / corrupt cop deserves punishment
Tabin Bell !(((((
Is this fucking black saw .?
Only thing that will make this worth watching is if they do reshoots for Chris Rock's scenes with another actor
Obviously you're going to watch it as I am so why look at the comments, foo.
Is it just me or when I saw this new saw trailer I felt really odd for some reason... But still excited for the new , Saw movie.
Afro Circus, Afro Circus, tadada tadada tadada...😅😅Sorry guys.
Osmosis Jones is solveing crimes
uzumaki?
Tommorow this movie will drop
Im sorry but im sure I won’t be able to take chris seriously when i watch this movie😂😂😂
Im waiting for Chris Rock to speak some nigga chronicles in this movie 😹
Let me guess Chris Rock will get captured then whoever the serial killer is will win.
What if the new jigsaw is danielll 😧
It just hit me, but why has it taken this long for Samuel Jackson and Chris Rock to be in a movie together???
I thought for a second it was fake because of Chris Rock’s funny ass
If SLJ I am all in
Great yet another unoriginal movie.
We best be getting a detective banks skin for DBD
Is this really only in theaters or will it come out on HBOMAX
I wish I could watch it but it is rated R ☹️
Yo my high ass thought it was about Shaq lol
Oh fuck it’s the Sega Dreamcast
This movie will be very interesting
Omg yes Chris Rock is gonna help save Jigsaw
His voice is just soo comedic
Hopefully if they play this song or trailer I can't wait to watch this movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait for the reveal of another Jigsaw apprentice.  We going to find out that Samuel L. Jackson is the one that gave Jigsaw cancer?
Is this a comedy?
I just realized there was 21 savage spiral playing in the background,whn Banks entered his dads house
The penguins are going so why can’t I? 🦓
Title should be black saw
Sam L bumping 21 lol
*Let the games begin*
I know full well that Chris Rock can play it straight from what I've seen of his cameo in Louie, so I'm excited to see what this movie has to offer
SYMBOLISM WILL BE THEIR DOWNFALL,CHECK OUT THE FBI PAEDO SWIRL !
Where those place located now
this week
Another saw 👀 no just no and chris rocks voice is not selling it all I hear is Marty from Madagascar music polkadot afro lol
This is what happens to all the people that didn't buy a dreamcast in 1999.
The voice sounds terrible compared to the jigsaw voice
I hope this is a great movie but I fear it won't be that it will just be a terrible horror movie with the saw tag on it  to sell it
Cant wait!
“I need everyone on this case!!! Now get me my big piece of chickeeeeen!!!!”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=199s
The Jigsaw killer is DEAD   John Kramer: (Looks down from heaven) Oh- its just getting started...
Chris Rick is one of the funniest comedians in the world but he CAN'T act his way out of a wet paper bag in my opinion. Dramatic horror.....NOPE!
Why did they use the Sega Dreamcast logo?
Looks like yet another bad chris rock comedy
The last time i watched i saw movie i stopped watching after 15 minutes and i wasn't in the theatre. Judging by this trailer I dont know if i should watch this in the theatre either!!!😬
i just cant take Chris Rock voice seriously

Chris rock have a funny voice that's no good, for a terror movie. The tapes voices don't have charisma at all, sounds like a teenager prank. Gonna the worst "saw" movie ever made
This actually looks good! The original creators of Saw and Chris Rock were executive producers so that at least seems promising. I hope it comes on to streaming soon as well so it’s not forgotten about while COVID continues.
My partner wants to watch this movie with me, I want to watch it because it would be interesting to see Chris Rock in a serious role. I don’t like movies full of gore honestly, someone tell me how gorey the saw movies are and can tell me what I’m in for.
I've got one this to say: I get Jigsaw aka Tobin Bell is getting old and Saw has been around technically a long time but it cannot end here of the Saw Series...I don't care if it hasn't been released to the point I cannot have an opinion. This trailer tells enough..WE NEED MORE SAW!!
Seriously  Rap in a horror Metal vibe movie ?  In the original saw we had a beautiful soundtrack, now this shit ?  The only saw it’s the first one and maybe saw 2
Hell yesss
the new voice is awful
If he dies he has to say “oh sugar honey ice tea” 😂 iykyk
I had to do a double take,  is this like Scream to Scary Movie type thing.  He was good playing Pookie in New JAck City so maybe he'll pull this off. I hope it works for him.
Pookie done come up!
Mômmmooolpomokmblpnommo.
Let’s play a game
I really dislike the voice they used for the "Jigsaw" recordings. Doesn't even sound like they tried to mask their voice.
Just when 2021 couldn get worse
I  can't  wait  to see  this  think  Chris  Rock  is  going to bring  a  fresh new  approach  to  the   series
Marty and Nick Fury in an R rated movie. I gotta see this XD
Can't wait for this movie!! Coming out this week going to see it! Glad chris rock is making a shift from comedy to horror drama!
Stg if I see a long ass car chase I’m done. 😔👍
Chile, I'm *ready* to see Chris's versatility. 🙌🏽
It’s eyebrows. He’s the killer.
Oh, Lord...not again. 😭
mandado
Pokie got off the cracks and turned his life around
Chris Rock's voice is so synonymous with comedy, it's gonna be a confusing time.
Me: “Chris rock?.... okay let’s try and take this serious... hmm .. so far so good.”  *sees Samuel L. Jackson*.   Me: I can take Chris Rock serious but now I can’t take Samuel L. Jackson serious 😂
This looks so bad.
Everybody saying “cris rock transitioning to a serious role” has never seen New Jack City R.I.P Pookie
this coming out on may this should be coming out on halloween 😂😭
Chris I’m sorry but I can’t take you serious 😂
*..*
Changing jigsaw's trademark  distorted voice?! Oh yell no! I'm outta here!!!
I've only seen the first saw movie. Will I understand this movie, or do I need to watch the other movies?
I *_CANNOT_* take his voice seriously!! 😂😂😂 I'd probably take SpongeBob more serious that ChrisRock... sorry. 😂😂
I think GrownUps2 was scarier than this. 😖😖😖😖
I like the saw theme song is much better
gledat ću ja to
Vivi you there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Glad they’re having fun with the story clearly.  A real reboot is what the franchise needed. Can’t wait to see this :)
I can’t take this movie seriously if Chris Rock is the lead actor.
Wow it's going to be a comedy horror fusion
EVERYBODY HAATES CHRISSS
Is that Chris rock? Wtf
This remind me of movie seven 1995 brad Pitt Morgan Freeman
I don't know why i keep hearing donkey from Shrek 😆😂😅
geee i dunno... chris rock the GOAT but not sure if i can take him serious in a horror
I was actually tired of the Saw series but this looks like it could breathe new life into the universe and Chris Rock seems like he's ready to bring his A game lately. I'm down for Spiral
Chris Rock sold out and got “woke” just like Chapelle... and wouldn’t ya know they are both getting work again. I’ll pass on this crap.
Hi
Madagascar 4 Looks Crazy.
All I hear is the hamster from dr Doolittle 😭
0:01 I already laugh
I can't wait for this to be released cuz Samuel L Jackson and Chris Rock are gonna be so damn good
I need this on bootleg nowwwwe
It’s basically that pig guy from Gotham
Philly 💪🏾
21 savage
Fuck yeah love it Toosh
I can never take Chris Rocks Voice Serious 😂
Chris rock is hilarious, but he’s a terrible actor. I hope he’s improved his skills a bit
Doesn't matter what this dude does, he will always look and sound like that crackhead from New Jack City......also his voice is like the male version of Fran Drescher... unbelievably fucking annoying!
need hoffman and dr gordon ! or its not saw
They had to ruin the franchise somehow I guess
I’m trying hard to think of a worse actor than Chris Rock to cast for this film. I guess they couldn’t get Steven Seagal, Hulk Hogan or Pauline Shore?
21 savage in movies now?
when the roblox game "piggy" updates-
None of the recent Saw films compare even remotely to the old school ones but this one looks good with actors people have actually heard of. Last one was trash hopefully this one won't be.
Wow parece que esse filme vai ser ótimo
Hollyweird has run out of ideas I see.... 🙄
Everytime I hear Chris Rock's voice, all I hear is Marty the Zebra from Madagascar..
I dont know guys....is like watching jim carrey in a horror movie...like...things dont FIT...lol.
Can’t wait to watch Chris rock scream in lower case for 90 minutes
I hope Murtaugh and Rigg come in at the end to help Butters.
Is Sam l Jackson supposed to be Chris rocks father in this?! That seems weird
I can’t fucking wait
1:00 "How can I catch this guy...if there's no-one on the BUS acting SUS?"
🛑
Only 4 Days till release.
Jesus Christ, I am an avid saw fan and I think this looks absolutely stupid. Seriously why do they have to go take a shit on a good rememberable franchise?
This is embarrassing
I thought this was Junji Ito Spiral..
Wtf is this...
I love how they had 21 savage do a song for this and they used it in the trailer. Oooo  :o
Me only watching this because of Hermione in Riverdale Lmao 😂
Hollywood looks so pathetic still spewing out this Satanic horror shit…
I’m ready, I’m ready I’m ready! 🧽
this is a joke right ?
My guess Chris Rock been outta the game so long since “Top Five “ and “Madagascar “ he hoping that the younger generation will know him for this. Or that we old heads forgot lol
Idk but I’m exited to watch this movie and I’m not a big fan of scary movies! 😭
Yes please
Who’s the lady? I forgot her name but she a baddie
Love it
Fun fact: The Orginal Title For This Movie Was Called “The Organ Donor”.
I was not a fan of that mascara it was very over rated. It was to clumpy.
I thought we were done with these movies.  I quit watching them years ago.
This one actually looks like one I wish to see! After the second, I kinda gave up on the franchise.... Will go see this!
I’m not a big fan of horror movies nor the saw franchise but this looks sick ngl(oh here is a small spoiler somone is going to cut off a god damn limb again🙄)
Haven’t watched the saw movies in awhile but this looks real good! I’ll definitely have to check it out!
Its refreshing to see Chris Rock play such a serious role....i guess he’s ready to transition
2021 When in doubt fill the movie with minorities that don't belong in the roles and have demonstrated a history of not being able to play those roles.
I'm So excited.
OOH GOD another fucking Saw Movie let this Garbage die already wasn't there already like 30 of them MADE.......
Jigsaw is still alive because if you back to those saw movies way back you can see some clues...
spiral gonna be astronomical
Not liking the new Jigsaw voice 😬
No Tobin bell?
Im sorry i can’t take Chris Rock with this type of acting lol
Fuck I can’t waitttt
This comes out on my birthday! And those who want me dead
The actress looks a lot like kate Middleton imo
I saw the trailer at the movie theater last night and I didn’t like jigsaws new voice on the recording I like the old
I can’t wait, I love both Tucker and Jackson. I’m interested to see how this plays out. ^^
Just let this franchise die. This looks like a joke film, Christ rock and Samuel l Jackson in a saw movie? It's barely even saw at this point
I have a theory, could be possible spoiler but it's just a prediction. Chris rock's partner is jigsaw. At around 2:03, you see a quick clip of a kid with Chris Rock looking like he's earlier in his career as a cop., The boy, Chris Rock's partner, probably witnesses Chris Rock maybe kill his dad or something by accident, and Chris Rock doesn't tell anyone. So as revenge, the boy grows up to become a cop at the same department as Rock and kills off all the crooked cops up one by one, until he gets to Chris Rock. Plus it adds up since in another clip, Rock talks about killing a crooked cop 12 years ago and his partner is relatively young so. Just a theory
Pretty hyped for this movie! I loved Saw. Haha. Just the first and second one though. Then it kinda got weird.
aint this uzumaki
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
I'm gonna have to watch the series now 🙄
Its so werid how chris rock who is funny plays in a very serious movie
No acting is going to change the way we see Chris rock… a movie like this is for someone else but I may watch it anyway
Looks good
I'm excited as this will be my first movie in theaters since the planndemic....$44.50 for 2 tickets ...definitely smuggling in my snacks but I'll get a $6 icey 😉
Who can PayPal me money the day it drops
before i see the movie i’m calling it hermione lodge was another saw apprentice and she’s the killer. based on the jigsaw voice
I’m ready for some scary shit ... bring it on!! 🔪
They got Chris makin’ those  Pooky faces again 🤣
I defiantly would NOT of put Chris rock in a movie with a serious role. Nobody is going to take him seriously. We’re all going to be waiting for him to say something comical. I seriously wouldn’t of put him in this movie. He needs to stick to what he is amazing at and that is comedies. Maybe use the guy who played Freddy Kruegers character in this type of roll. I think he would of been a much better fit. Well unfortunately my expectations aren’t very high for the simple fact that they used a comedian in a serious roll. I’m hoping that it meets or even exceeds my expectations but time will tell
The story has just begon
How old is Bryce and Elle
song name please
HAHAHAHAHAHA! Nope!
I thought this was an Uzumaki trailer for American audiences but I love saw too so that’s cool too ig
Never thought I’d see another installment to the series, and never would’ve thought that two of the best actors around would star in it 😩🙏🏾💯
I feel like this is gonna have such a huge plot twist at the end
I hope Chris Rock didn’t get killed in this🥺
I’ve waited a lifetime to finally see Chris  Rock play a serious role. Thank you it’s about time. This will be his best performance in years. He is a great actor.
Idk, I don’t think it will be that good
A decade later
This is going to be hilarious smh lol I could never take Chris Rock and Samuel L. serious in any movie so this one will be a classic lol
Chris Rock already helped ruin The Witches movie for me...now Saw? Way to go🤦
This looks hella wack
Chris Rock in a Saw movie? Yea thats gay
Spoiler: daniel (son of eric mathews) is the one who is making these games.
Chris rock better fucking survive
dreamcast, is that you?
Looks terrible.
I cant take this seriously. Chris rocks voice is hilarious and he always looks like he is about to smile or laugh. This isnt going to work
Me watching the trailer:this couldn't be any better. 21 Savage start singing🔥
If a trailer could win a Oscar...
Chris rock? really ?
They are never going to let the Saw franchise die I aren't they?
They really are squeezing every last drop out of this concept. Now it’s finally gotten to Jigsaw ‘N Tha Hood. At least they skipped over Jigsaw in Space.
20 years and he’s once again, a cop. Except it’s not Osmosis Jones 😂
Pookie getting dramatic n shit
"He could be anywhere!" Me: Lmaooo "He could be anyone." Me: Bahahah "We are gonna tear this city apart." Me: OMG IM DED 💀 🤣 CR is hilarious!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
My thoughts about this movie: 1:27
New Jack City Junkie to Cop.... Niceee
Chris rock will die at end of the movie
I believe this will be one of the top 3 or 4 best Saw movies easily.  I love almost all the saw movies as well
I’m excited to see Chris Rock extend his reach out of comedy
Spiral sounds like a concerned mother
Chris rock acting looks terrible
May 14th is my Birthday
SAME OLD SHIT!
2:18 before he went to the gas station to get milk
This is trying way too hard to be SAW
Looks like the last 5 saw films... with less white people lol
Yes I like that Chris Rock is gonna be in a horror movie and this will be the only reason I watch another saw movie lol
i thought its A saw parody when i saw chris rock but after watching the trailer, no it not a parody holly shit what if its IS a parody
Finna be so good
So this is what happened to Tremendous Repeat after losing to Supa Hot
This trailer has basically spoiled everything basically
Hey, here’s a joke. What does this franchise, a dead horse and Saturday night live over the last 4 years have in common? They all involve beating a concept into the ground.
It’s gonna be hard to not focus on Chris rocks voice but I can’t wait to see how the movie is gonna turn out
This supposed to been out this old
hahaha still don't give up saw
That 21 savage song is really good I won’t even lie
Something VERY different to see C.R. in a serious movie....
Osmosis, more like Osmosus.
I was hoping this was based on the ito manga
Did you make the back version 🤣is that right? Geez man....this got stupider.
Chirs rock is going to rock this moive
Chris Rock in FARGO was great!
Oh no...Dreamcast has returned to kill again!  (Am I the only one who immediately thought that when they saw the red swirl?)
ALRIGHT!!!  😃😃😃
I want to see this so bad! Can't wait until the 14th I love Chris Rock!!
it looks so insanely stupid, i can't wait to see it!
oh this one is gonna be good
Kinda wish they at least got Tobin to reprise the Jigsaw voice even if we never saw him on screen. Otherwise this looks dope.
I miss clicked I was watching creepy doom wads
Naruto
Hey
A Saw movie without Tobin Bell a.k.a John Kramer? I hope they don't ruin the legendary story built upon years of effort.
No sex in the champagne room
Chris you’re gonna have to do something to stop being the funny guy man. Good luck
Ya'll discouraging me because of Chris's voice 😂😂😂
Aweeeee look at Hollywood trying.   Bless your hearts.   You even put in some pedophile symbols.  Hollywood is DEAD AND WILL STAY DEAD no matter how hard you try.   🖕
It's hard to take that voice seriously.  Everything sounds like a punch line
CR is a standup comic performer he can't be a serious detective like Morgan Freeman in Se7en. When I hear his voice I want to laugh because I remember his hilarious sitcom about times when he was young :) It looks like a big joke or something
Im not going to be able to take this movie seriously lmao. I will be thinking about a damn zebra.
A copy cat killer.... Why... Just ressurect John Kramer
Where is billy?
I really hope old characters from the saw 1-7 come in and from jigsaw
21 Savage - Spiral
Not going to lie I like the old puppet than this puppet
.aa
I don’t think Chris can sell this roll. I’m definitely interested to see how it plays out. Just based off the trailer, he was trying to hard to be serious and that can detrimental to the role. I hope I’m wrong and the trailer doesn’t show his acting range.
Marty came a long way from Madagascar
Ok for. Person who watched all jigsaw movies..... Nothing can beat jigsaw bro im sorry jigsaw  is like a trama movie for me but i'll still watch it aftwr i do im honna watch all the jigsaw movies
Chris rock looking like pookie in the thumbnail lol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Terrible...
Everything Chris says sounds like he's telling a joke.
Movies are still a thing? 🥱🥱🥱
21 savage song in background is awesome (it's called spiral).
Nice acting
Anyone hyped after listening to 21??
Looks like a good movie, but tell me that’s not the Dreamcast logo spray painted everywhere.
I can’t wait 😝
Where's adam sandler??
dude all i hear is a zebra
Me waiting for the Afro circus scene
This movie is going to be crackalackin
chris rock was such a perfect choice but his voice always makes me laugh bc of memories and other roles but his acting really came through
This is a first for me.  I don't think I've ever seen Chris Rock take on a serious role like this and it looks good 👌
WOW🤩 Not Chris Rock I have to see this one!!
Cuervito ya se dieron cuenta que somos vecinos aquí en Boston 🥰
1:19 21? LMAO
When I saw Chris Rock I thought this was a spoof!
21 21 21
I haven’t been big into horror movies, but ngl the title and imagery just straight up steals from both uzumaki, the title is the exact same as uzumaki, like how do they expect to release this movie in Japan without getting in trouble unless they just call it spiral instead of translating it. Idk I could just be a salty fanboy, I just really hope that they don’t try to incorporate the spirals into the horror because then that would just be straight up copying and honestly just probably wouldn’t be done the way it should be.  Honestly just a little upset because I thought it was an uzumaki adaptation when I first read the name and that would be gooooooooood.
Another load of shit
been itchin for some more saw     YES HAVE SOME
I am sorry but his acting just isn't good here at all.
2:12
Chris Rock looking like Pookie! 😂
Lawd...I do not like Chris Rock...but because of my boy Jackson Ima watch❗
"Jigsaw didn't go crazy, Jigsaw went Jigsaw!"
I’m actually exited to see how well Chris rock acts in this movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Hard to take Chris Rock and Sam Jackson as anything but hilarious.
So they are making a woke version of saw? Fuck this woke Hollywood BS I’m glad nobody watches these shit movies anymore.
Idk if I can take Chris Rock serious in a role like this but we'll see
Every Saw movie ever made since Saw 2: “Wait, I thought the jigsaw killer was dead”
Why am I laughing as soon as I see his face?? This is a horror flick, right ??😂😂
This looks like both 1970s and 2010s
I already know who the killer is it’s the old man who said “have you seen your father” cuz the saw killer says that
FINALLY ANOTHER SAW 🪚
All I can hear is grown ups 2
Was that my dude McMurphy from Letterkenny???
1:20 21's rap is gonna be at this scene then..
He playing alll of them
Chris rock will ruin this reboot!!!
I'm hoping this will not be a disappointment, most modern horror movies aren't the best nowadays
For some reason his looks like itll be a very censored version of the original saw movies, way less on screen violence
“So tell me Detective Banks...where is Madagascar 4?” 😂
ngl, im curious to see chris rocks performance
⭕️⭕️⭕️ June 14th
His voice is still hilarious.
When i first saw this i was expecting a comedy like Scary Movie....
my guy 21 savage made a song to promote this movie! :O
I saw him, The Jigsaw
Can't wait to watch this omg
Not going to lie kinda excited to see Chris Rock act again
It hard to picture Chris Rock serious haha Donkey from Shrek
should be funny as hell!!!
Wow this looks like the best one wow
21 savage on the beat ayo?!
Never in my life was I expecting to see Chris Rock in an R rated horror film
All I heard was Donkey, sorry Chris Rock.
2:02 the bathroom from first SAW :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
W movie
This looks fucking awesome another one to the collection
By the time this movie finally come out part 2 should be coming out with it
Anybody but Chris fucking Rock terrible actor and overrated comedian
Another bad trailer that reveals too much.
It looks excellent.
Yeah I’m definitely thinking the same as most that I don’t think I’m going to be able to take Chris Rock seriously when he’s yelling 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ it’s an awesome concept and story with great actors but I don’t know how to feel about Chris Rock in a serious role and a cop too. 🤔🤔🤔
2 things I want in this movie:  -Billy The Puppet Coming Out and Saying "I want to play a game." -Flashbacks featuring John Kramer
I'm scared and this a part 2 to a different one
expect samuel character to throw down many mother fuckers in this one
“Jigsaw cannot go down in lifestyle! He can’t!”
I swear if this trailer just gave away the entire twist of the movie already I'm going to be pissed. They have one of Chris Rock's agents ask him "When was the last time you saw your father?" and the voice on the tape also happens to say the same thing word for word. SMH that doesn't seem like just a coincidence to me.
Chris Rock voice is not ment for a horror movie.
Can you do a video on MoonJuice? Chuck Norris just backed it in a video. It’s the first energy drink backed by crypto. $MOJO
That siht like it's have you looking like this 😲😬🤫🥺
Im so happy for Chris Rock :) love seeing this side of him!
I can’t take Chris rock seriously, especially after playing a zebra on Madagascar
This shit looks good
why chris rock? why not will smith with all in his life he probably seem a better lunatic. sorry chris nothing against you but shit you suck at horror..your a comic relief when you are the main protagonist.
Oh yes!! I’m down with this 🍇🥝🍉🫐🍋🍊🍐🍎🍏🍓🥭🍍🍑🍒
You've been told
Good cops obey the law including traffic laws bad cops don't phariseetical fine them another episode no cops the self appointed police deserve tickets as well as self appointed pillars of the community rather than cut breaks they should be charged double we the tax payers make 1/2 the money they do. That code blue is corrupt drag them to court just like everyone else they won't escape judgment day neither will ior you
Starting Samuel L Jackson as Samuel L Jackson. Chris Rock as Chris Rock
STOP CAUSE THIS LOOKS AMAZING
Me *look at the thumb nail 👀 Chris rock 👀 Chrisrockk!?!?🚶🏽‍♂️
I wanna watch this. But Chris Rock...
This looks like it will be the best movie of the Saw franchise, or not
It's Thinking... Dreamcast2
21 savage brought me here lol
Bruh I was just watching Saw IV last night.
Sorry but I just cant take chris rock serious. I just cant.
Chris Rock: oh sugar honey ice tea  *running away from killer*
wow the remake of sev7n looks good :P i kid, i like gritty thrillers (opposed to horror) i might have to give this one a watch
I can’t wait this looks awesome
im just now knowing about this!!!!
when’s the last time you saw your father ? 🤷🏿‍♂️
I can’t take Chris rock seriously
@1:07 is that lela Starr???😂
The very first saw movie was actually pretty interesting .. almost noir vibes
Sega Dreamcast
I like that chris rock has been taking up more serious roles as of late
I can’t take Chris rock serious I’ve heard his voice in to many comedies and his voice is just funny😂😂
Imma watch, but idk if I can take Chris a rock seriously
Callin it now, Samuels the bad guy lol
Ohh shit time for some binge watching.
Sorry I just can't take him seriously! He doesn't fit the drama rolls..and his silly voice just doesn't help..im still gonna watch the movie though...
Chris Rock is playing a police officer.
So Sam had Chris at 16?
Why Chris? Why??? I get it but,  whyyyy?
Can’t wait
This shit look 🥂🔥🔥🔥
Chris Rock must need a 3rd swimming pool in his yard.... ffs. Bring back Farley 😫
1:07 just screams sus or it’s the chick working with him. Just a guess because when was the last time you saw your father could be a clue to say hey he’s in the room, and it feels too much like a red herring.
I CAN'T WAIT
Quit making these crap movies! No wonder our world is twisted!
If he had never done comedy would you question his horror acting talent
Finally dead by daylights Amanda young “the pig” is actually a proper solo killer
Let's let the man grow.  If you missed Rock in Fargo check it out. He's actually really good.
Even in one of the most gruesome iconic movie franchise i I know Chris rock is going to make some funny jokes
anyone notice the newer trend of incorporating hiphop into spooky trailer theme music? this comes probably at a time when more black writers and directors are taking space in the horror and thriller genres....love it
Rock soft acting chops
I want to say bro wtf to the Chris Rock casting decision but then I remember Running Scared with Paul Walker and I will vow to keep an open mind until the end.
come on Chris Rock can't do non comedic stuffs
Pog champ
Lol,I laughed through most of this. Idk if that's good or bad.
Samuel l jackson and chris rock. Really hope its a good movie. Gunna watch it anyway tho.
I kaint take Chris rock serious
Uzumaki
Todos deben ser tratados igual
Is he getting more attractive as he ages ?!?!? It’s a yes from me
A ruthless gangster in Fargo Season 4. Now this? I love Chris Rock as a dramatic actor!
Got my tickets ready 😎
I hope they won't screw it up with this movie, as they did with the last one ... Why don't they continue with the main story, where did Saw 3D end?

Ugh Chris Rock in a dramatic role???? Im just waiting for him to yell AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK ITS SATURDAY NIGHTTTT LIVEEEEEE
SOOOOOOOOO glad they are making a push for the jigsaw series to go super legit. The lead actors being legends and all, plus McMurray from letterkenny is in  it so that’s dope too, he’s like by far my favorite character
I just can’t take Chris rock voice seriously in this movie 🤣🤣🤣
1:02 I was crying 😭 🤣
Billy the puppet?
سلام این فیلم کی پخش می شه اینو خیلی دوست دارم
They love to ruin a franchise
YES!!!! I’m really pumped to see this movie. I’m so glad that a new version of Saw is coming out. It looks like it’s going to be an awesome movie 👍
Uzumaki vibes
I just hope it’s not one of those movies, whos trailer gives then entire movie away.
Padre gabriel
I’m ready...
This is gonna be trash. Horrible but ridiculous and stupid somebody should of told him not to waste his money. Making it Samuel can't save this
😂😂what the hell Chris Rock doing
ayo its marty
This was the only way to bring back SAW is with the legendary black actors !!!!
This looks really good but I feel like they showed too much. Seeing Chris rock and Samuel Jackson tied up and handcuffed feels like endgame stuff. At least Chris rock. Maybe I’m wrong but I don’t see how that can’t be very late in the movie.
Man, will somebody please tell Chris Rock that he sucks as an actor and to stay out of movies and TV shows. Thank you.
How much for a order of ribbbbs
I can’t take this serious lmaoo the fact that I know we will be dealing with pure comedians
Why do I feel like this gonna be really shit and tame like Saw 6 and Saw The Final Chapter. It’s like they’re trying to make it kid friendly
Ghana paaaa you all should be arrested by now oh Ghana where are we going Ghana police 👮‍♀️ why hmmmm is very sad, because I don’t think you are doing a good job 👏
I’m here cuz of 21 Savage!!!
“I have had enough of these mothafuckin traps in this mothafuckin game”  - Samuel L Jackson
I kinda wanna c this ...not because i think it’ll be scary (doesn’t seem like it)... but because of the story... who is jigsaw? In this movie.
1:13  I figure he’s the villain, because that same question gets asked at the end of the trailer.
I thought of the manga uzumaki
Finallyyyyyyy I’ve been waiting
Man this gone be a comedy 😂😂😂
They need to stop focusing on the detectives so much. That’s where the series went downhill
yooo movies gotta be lit if we got 21 on the soundtrack 🔥🔥🔥
Mace Windu: Your under arrest
There's Hope for the saw franchise
Where is the Jigsaw voice👎👎
I just saw this trailer in an ad and I am wondering if anyone else thought of Junji Ito's Uzumaki.
I cannot lie, this is dumb the fact they changed the masked pigs and the voice overall of the "imposter".
"That Jigsaw speaks so well! I mean he really, really speaks so well."
The movie looks great I’m just worried on how Chris rock is gonna play a serious role
New jigsaw killer I wonder if there gonna show the killer
The scary movie edition of saw?
*Hello detective banks. Do you know where your officers are at?*
Bet you its the girl.
Man I really don’t like these new trailer styles like how much dopamine do you need to sit through it bruh, constant need for loud noises etc so lame
I’m calling it now. The killer in this movie is going to be the other detective who asked Chris Rock, “when was the last time they saw their father”. Because at the end of the trailer the killer asks him the same question.
one thing SAW fans don't want is happy ending.
Playing that 21🔥🔥
..should let the sam.l.jackson do the yelling
This actually looks good. At first I was skeptical with Chris rock being in a movie like this because he’s always the funny guy but it actually looks good. A different side to his acting ! Looking forward to watching it.
Can’t wait for this movie love the saw series this is gonna get good
I feel like Chris Rock is the killer tbh
As long as he remembers.....There’s no sex in the champagne room...
Samuel L Jackson is gonna die in this film and imma be upset
Soooo his dad is the jigsaw copy cat cuz he won't talk to him???? Lol
They should have voice over dubbed Chris rock
If this is the new voice of jigsaw I don't want it
سااد
How much can they milk Jigsaw before they admit killing him off in SAW 3 was the biggest mistake the franchise ever made?
Chris Rock 🥰
I can't take him being serious serious. But I'll watch looks a bit suspenseful.
Hey is this going to be on hbomax soon?
Jigsaw is a female now? Please
Donkey tripping these days
Damn.... this going to be awful....
😍😍😍
I can’t take Chris rock serious at all😂 I like Chris rock but they should of picked someone else
adam with uncut gems chris with spiral  they really challenging themslves
21 savenge 🔥
Please add Mark Hoffman don't remove he 😭
Can't wait
Sounds like more about the cops side vs all the gore from the victims perspective. I’m not one for gore so this will be worth a look for sure. Anything with Samuel is a good bet
Looks stupid. Typical Hollywood trying to squeeze one last drop out of a series that is way past its prime 🙄🙄
F Chris
That guy with the blue face looks like Chris Ramsay
Man finally ive been waiting for them to bring back the Scary Movie franchise!
Вау
Aquí viene 21 savage... Here comes 21 savage💣
Holy hell this is gonna be good!
No one talking about that 2:22 trap?! That looks like some sort of a Marionette Device.
They got that 21 savage playing in the sound track 🔥💯
I both hate and love these movies and this is just gonna make me love them a bit more. But Chris Rock is gonna make me see a whole new side to him and his acting and I am so ready for this movie.
Can't believe that they still making movies bout this shit didn't he die 5 movies ago lol
I’m sorry but no one will take crock seriously with that voice
I think I’m the only one that thinks this movie is a joke. I can’t take Chris Rock seriously. And well, it’s not the same dark twisted genre feeling. 🤷🏻‍♀️
If there's a scene where Samuel L. Jackson calls Jigsaw a motherfucker, this movie is already a 10/10 for me
Everyone is talking about Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson, but where’s the love for Darren Bousman? His first entry in the franchise since Saw IV and I’m so stoked he’s returning.
Chris: "How can I catch this guy; if there's no one on the force that I can trust?" (serious voice) *insert imaginary laugh track* Me: Lol
already calling the killer its the dude who said when was the last time you saw your father
so it looks like rush hour 4 took a dark turn
Nick Fury: Jigsaw I m here to talk to you about your arrest initiative
So Nice Fury vs Jigsaw. This is going to be LIT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
This goin be a drama movie with Chris Rock and Samuel. L . Jackson Spiral: From The Book Of Saw Movie Also Got 21 Savage it's Litty!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I’m interested on watching this!!!
His voice is just too fucking comedic, I don't if I'm watching a horror-comedy or a comedy horror.
2:03 something tells me this kid grew up to be the Jigsaw copycat
This looks far better than Jigsaw. I really hope it tries to stay somewhat true to the original series, while avoiding the MESS that Jigsaw was.
I still cant take this movie serious with his voice 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pookie was doing so well.
Is everyone afraid to criticize this movie because the leads are black?  Bet jigsaw is a woman huh?
I don't care what genre they say it is, if Chris Rock is in it then it's a comedy
Wow so is this the social justice BLM saw?  Good god this is gonna suck
HBO max?? 🍿
this doesnt seen like saw anymore, cause he targeting cops
Looks like a $5 DVD purchase.
I ain't sayin' he did it............but I understand.
every time i hear chris rock i can’t unhear madagascar.
Jigsaw was terrible. I hope this film makes it non-canon.
Cinematography is looking pretty flat and basic. God forbid we get a lil style and contrast.
I can already tell Chris Rock's acting is gonna be pretty spotty. Not that it will be anything new to this franchise.
The Saw movies are genius in their own terrifying way. I feel like the last 2 of them weren't authentic to the previous ones but still watchable though...
Can't wait for this!
Looks more like an Action movie then...horror
Damn. I’ve gotten used to HBO Max now. I don’t wanna go to the movies.
Gives me a Se7en type vibe
2:00 hey look John Kramer
I can’t take Chris Rock seriously. every time I hear him I want to laugh.
Oh look Chris Rock, the comedian famous for his number joke about black people v N words... who then disappeared much like Chapelle (who also had similar views) who was forced to go woke and political and now voila, he gets serious work in Hollywood(again, much like Chapelle). Must be a coincidence.
A must see for me . I'm a Chris Rock fan.
I like everything but the voice. Tobin Bell set the bar high but this missed it by a mile. Not even a close second to John Kramer asking if I want to play a game.
Plot twist chris rock is jigsaw
This is going to be awesome!! I love all the saw movies
i dislike the fact that Chris Rock is in this, kinda seems like this is the nail in the coffin for the SAW series. What a shame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Calling it now. This is gonna shit
it’s marty in jigsaw universe
Looks like a fan made satire trailer lmao
This better be a good saw movie cause if not I’m going to start playing games with people
Calling it. The white police captain is going to be the bad guy in the end. It can’t be a women or person of color because of actual Hollywood writing room standards in place right now.
I already guessed it’s Chris rock himself
Confeti ft. Saweetie Friday, April 30th🔥🔥
I don’t think I’ll take Chris Rock seriously in this film lol
Everyone in here talking shit on Chris rock. Y’all see the movies in the past, having Shitty B grade acting is what it’s always been
Chris Rock will be fine just cause you start as a Comedian dont mean you can grow stop Stereotype hes electic funny or serious
Hollywood is killing all police in a movie. Convenient huh
Saw: Let's play a game? Chris: What? Saw: How much for "just one rib"?
I collect the saw series, now more to add to it especially with Chris Rizo!! Awesome, one love
I feel like this is satire. Too good to be true. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait to see what the absolutely unrealistic illogical twist ending is. Turns out jigsaw is chris rock's adoptive father is my guess. You?
What's the song
I honestly thought Samuel L Jackson was going to recruit Chris Rock to the Avengers when they met in the trailer.
YES!!!!!!!
cops chasing one lone nut while working for the biggest criminal organization of all time the government lmao
I can’t help but laugh Bc it’s Chris rock I love him but like everything he says is funny
Can’t take Chris rock series in this type of movie
I’m imagining Chris rock in a trap, wearing a Afro and is forced to say           RA DA DA DA DA DA DUN DUN DUN DUN AFRO CIRCUS POLKA DOT POLKA DOT AFRO!
Jigsaw may be dead, but his legacy will live forever in forms of sequels and spinoffs
Call of duty Modern warfare Halloween
This comes out on my daughter birthday awesome
Did this movie come out already help
YES
Yo I’m actually excited for this
😂😂😂 please tell me this is a joke. I cannot take Chris Rock serious for this type of role.
Omg pleaseee can we let the saw franchise die? We had enough,I thought it was the end at Jigsaw
Oh, buddy!
Looks good but I can’t take Chris Rock’s voice seriously 😂 It always sounds comedic!
Im in there
1:14 is the killer. “When was the last time you seen your father”
Chris dun gave me chills
I can't believe I'm dying to see another damn Saw film lol, but here I am. This looks good
Tik tak tow Scp-1918 Play game saw kill all ☠📈
I just told my dad we gotta see his. WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING SEE THIS MOVIE I SWEAR TO FUCKING GO-
I can’t take take this movie seriously with Chris rock in it , thought it was a parody film at first
Kinda hard to take seriously as a horror movie when they have a 21 savage song on the soundtrack and Chris rock as the lead. I hope I’m wrong but I guess we’ll see.
Was this the U.S. adaptation of the Japanese film "UZUMAKI"?
Im watching saw rn whatsup
lionsgate is sponsored by the CCP. you go watch this movie you invest in chinas military...
Chris Rock looks so damn goofy 😂 I don't wanna see him be serious
Idk..never imagined these two being in a movie together. Especially a SAW movie lol. just odd
If Chris Rock doesn’t learn to keep himself out of movies! I hate seeing him on the big screen or even just hearing his voice come from that annoying, unfunny zebra. He’s talented but there’s just something abt films that Chris just compatible with. His best work was when he was Pookie or the mailroom guy in Boomerang.
Hell yea 😈
I just.... can’t take Chris Rock seriously. I’m sorry guys. lol
Deepfry
Find my comment!
Jigsaw: Put up a tupac shakur street sign in howard beach
jigsaw ? nah, *NARUTO*
D. O. P. E 💯💯
Brave move casting Chris rock as lead
Can't take him serious he is goofy
2:08 is that my pillow guy?🤣
Well Chris rock was pookie in new jack city.. that was kinda dramatic.. I’ll give this a shot
It’s gonna be so hard for me to take Chris rock seriously 😭
Live out your dreams.
The killer is the lady cop!
Look
So it’s saw but with a black lead. Gotcha. 👌🏻
When Chris starts talking I start laughing, lol smh how can we take him serious?
The trailer seems to me that it’s mostly about Chris Tucker and Samuel L Jackson staring in the movie and less like a “Saw” movie.
So Samuel is the new saw
Chris Rock doesn’t have the voice or voice inflections to do drama.
To understand the series should I go back and watch Saw 1? Or does it not matter v
When someone told me that they were making a black version of saw i said oh really? Is it called Seent....  after watching the trailer. I will no longer talk shit. This looks good.
I’ll wait for it to be free on TV. Refuse to support some people.
sEeNt
Does he ever age? He somehow looks younger than he did in Grown Ups
Cant take chris serious
I JUST CANT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY AS A HORROR MOVIE WITH CHRIS ROCK, IT FEELS LIKE A SPOOF OR LIKE CHRIS RICK IS GONNA CRACK A JOKE EVERYTIME IN THIS MOVIE
I’m so excited to not watch this movie!! 😂😂
Looks good. So watching this!
Showed too much in the trailer. I feel like I already know who the killer is
What if it’s not a copy cat but jigsaw had a twin ???
Chris looks great in the role but it’s gonna be hard to take him serious 😂😂😂
Is that you Pookie?
Rona out der ain’t going to dat bih
Oh man I can't take him seriously with that voice.
I can’t take Chris rock serious
Looks good! Gonna watch it!
Elated for this
Plot twist: it’s Hiram lodge.  Welcome to riverdale
All I saw was the thumbnail at first, I thought this was some kind of New Jack City sequel lol Chris lookin like Pookie in that shot
Why Chris Rock 😕 LOL
I love every single Saw movie but they always looked a bit cheap, the cinematography and everything looks way more professional in this movie. I can‘t wait
Box of doodoo movie
YESS
Even though I doubt it dr.Gordon took out Hoffman for John he’s still out there it’s a stretch but he could’ve been an accomplice and in saw 8 they don’t even mention him so idk
One of the people playing the game should be a crackhead named Pookie 😂
Super hyped for this, but god damnit I cannot take Chris seriously. “I need everyone on this case” and I’m just seeing a Zebra looking at lions paw prints.
They might have spoiled it lol
Chris Rocks the same from I’m going to get you sucka
is this about the shea dreamcast
Those "Pookie" crackhead eyes did it for me @1:58 😆😆😆
Can't wait to see the lazy writing involved in this storyline
Calling it rn samuel jackson is the killer
Getting osmosis jones vibes from Rock again and ita awesome
🍹🍸🔥I cant take this movie seriously for some reason...I never seen Chris this serious ...Ever  I cant...this movie look to good...and his father is .... The "Samuel  Jackson" .... Definitely a must watch... #Jigsawback  I cant
Chris Rocks voice doesn’t fit the movie lol. It’s distracting!
🔥
I cut my toe off one time to save my finger........
I love chris rock but i don't know about this roll lol. We shall see
I just see the donkey from shrek...
Pookieeee
All I know is I better get a mf from Sam Jackson🤬
Yea, would of liked it a lot more without Chris Rock. And I Fukin love Chris Rock stand up. Top 5 for me. But this looks like a bad ass carefully thought out movie. WHO THE HELL CASTED CHRIS ROCK???
Song kinda goes off 1:20🔥
CAN'T WAIT!!!
Hard to take Chris rock seriously. I just laugh everytime he talks
His voice is going to ruin this movie for me.
They spinning nigga they spinning
SURPRISE! IT’S ADAM SANDLER!
I can add this one to the saw collection that I have yes lord
I’m sorry but all I can picture is Marty the Zebra when he talks 😂😂
So we not gonna talk about my son 21 Savage music in the background
F Covid-19, I'm going to see this!!!
I gotta see tis😮
HBO Max?
Woot, more boring movies with black people in them for the sake of having black people in them. Saw 1 was good. Then it wasn’t. Stop this. Stop this now
Pookie turned his life around & became a detective
Damn im hype
Easy. Take off the blade and use the metal thick part to break the cuffs.
Ahh the boy love symbol. Good job holly weird.
I enjoy the Saw movies, but I find it nearly impossible to take anything Chris Rock does seriously.
I’m sorry but I can’t take Chris rock serious in a scary movie. I’m expecting him to be funny asf
This almost feels like a parody movie with Chris Rock in it
I’ve always thought Chris rock deserves serious rolls , I’m sure he killed this. Chris rocks
I got a theory that it might be the little girl from Saw 3 that might be the copycat killer or it might be Saw 2's Detective son . Might be one of them and maybe they involved Hoffman ...? Anyways I'm hyped for this film 😍it seem more focus on the characters . And my other theory is that they won't find the killer at the end and that there where they open that car is the ending and it'll lead into a cliffhanger for the sequel
Whoever thinks this looks good couldn’t have been alive when the first SAW came out 😂
It's kinda hard to separate that voice from comedy.
The concept for this actually seems pretty decent. It gives me Zodiac killer vibes. It’s nice to see Chris Rock making a comeback too.
This looks fucking ridiculous
My comments coincidentally have forced itself into mafia13 once again, precariously placed posición above the tagnamed" primadonna," how in the fudgesickle did i do anything  instigating murderers and whatnot When  the bloody occultists you all are positively talking about is you all
What the hell did i just watch
Im waiting for him to say “Motusin!”
Sorry but I could not talk Chris Rock serious if he was yelling at me
I can’t take Chris rock serious, not saying he can’t act, but every time I here his voice I just start laughing
Aaaaaand every sequel after this wont be as good
Why am i laughing
Chris Rock hasn’t given us a movie and years...and THIS is the movie he decides to take??? I’m still going to watch it!
Chris Rocks voice is a bit obnoxious for him to play in this type of movies
Chris rock kills his father sam Jackson, spoiler alert
Forensics Team: "the bodies have been mutilated in methodical ways, each ripped apart according to the bad shit they did when they were alive.  Looks like we got another Jigsaw Killer on our hands...  My God, I thought it was all over...  I don't know who could possibly track down this sick son of a bi-"  Chris Rock:  *WUS KRACKALACKIN'??!!*
This better be good
I Wonder How Many Times Samual L Jackson Will Say Muth******* 😂😂
I’m Watching This Trailer With My Eyes squinted ...Wondering Can He Pull This Off ??   I Think He Can Pull It Off
Chris rock and Sam Jackson ?!?? Movie of the year
Wtf man I can’t take this movie seriously when the main character used to voiced that talking zebra from Madagascar 😂😂😂 this is the worst
Had my attention until I saw Sam Jackson. Pass.
New 21 Savage Song?
Pookie & Gator. Cheers
I SUPPORT YOU CHRIS ROCK!
Looks stupid
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😤
Another Samuel L Jackson movie 😂
Hard to take a comedian serious lml
Chris Rock? Suspense?
This movie looks like its going to be good!
This actually looks like the first good Saw film since, well...SAW.
Why Lil Jigsaw sound like Lil Yachti??
Yeahhhhh skip
Finally a movie with black people not being oppressed, victimized to systematic racism and or drugs or hood violence, lol looks good
So now even saw has to please them n go Urban. Disgusting MAGA
Why is everything getting released in may
Oh hell yea....I can't wait
Wow I’m late but this movie is deep... generational curse. Will be watching 📽
Chris rock still acts like Puki in the movie New Jack City🤣🤣
Donkey vs Jigsaw
I predicted awhile back that the only way for Chris Rock to really take off is to act in dramas.He never had that presence to carry a movie;he always need an ensemble cast.And when you see him now,older,that whiny voice don’t cut it anymore unless it’s standup/comedy!my humble 2cents.
Hope they put the on hbo
Dope
This trailer actually makes it look pretty interesting. Glad to see Chris rock in a different type of roll!
This seem like turning a cheesy horror flick into a psychological thriller/detective film and I'm all for it holy wow
Chris Rock I can’t
I’m gonna watch this even though I don’t think it’s gonna be as good as the previous ones, I’m not a big fan of Chris rocks acting outside of comedy 🤷🏾‍♂️ but Samuel L always bring it 💪🏾
Finally Osmosis Jones 2
This is a comedy movie right?
Sees "a new game begins" Sees *red spiral*  Thinks "ah ha.. Dreamcast homebrew!"
SAW! Oh  man this is awesome
Chris rock is the killer maybe idk some stupid twist at the end
"We don't need no Jigsaw control! We need bullet control!"
When he said “get everybody out of here” I started laughing 😆
Stop with these shitty saw movies
Is that the kid from art school confidential? Wtf lol
Looks interesting enough 🤔
Chris rock is gonna ruin this movie lol
https://youtu.be/vmw7LAdGFdU
Well, I {saw} this coming ..
IS THIS ANOTHER FAN MADE TRAILER 🤷‍♂️
I can’t tell if this is a horror movie or a comedy
Oh hell nah
That movie looks pretty dope the last one was horrible
The theme of dirty cops and pig masks fits well during these times
The writer of this movie is the director of the worst parody movie ever made called The Hungover Games.
What’s in the box?
SO excited to see this! I can only imagine the tricks they have up their sleeves!
I can already count on dead meat to count the kills and I can watch the movie
Looks amazing have to see this and Chris rock with a more serious role 💪🏾💯
All im sayin is if i have to sit in horror watching chris rock go through the pain of sawing his arm off i cannot watch this😂 i just cant
Chris rock playing in a serious  role I want to see it
Why’s Sam Jackson always just letting himself into people’s homes lmao
Chris rock could face off against saw as MC Gusto
After Fargo I think Chris could pull off other roles. This one kinda seems off. I think it's him yelling is what makes it a comedy.
Chris already has played a cop before and did great in Letal Weapon
Every time I hear Chris rock talking off camera I expect the the camera to pan  over to a zebra
Chris rock is going to attempt to save this film then I saw Samuel Jackson and realized that everything was all good  😌
Man. Chris Rock going drama is such an career evolution for this individual. Going the Jordan Peele route from comedy to horror drama.
This movie looks so beautiful shot WOW
Why does it feel like Chris Rock made a student film?? Also I was laughing throughout this trailer. Even Sam Jackson sounded like he thought he was in a comedy 😆
I wanna see this movie as I love the Saw movies, but Chris Rock?? I dunno how this is gonna work out.
Just knowing who Chris Rock is made me laugh I hand to take his acting seriously
Problem is I can’t get pookie out of my mind when I see him
Is that fucking McMurray?
Not sure how I feel about this, I always liked Saw because there were no super famous people in it so I could focus on what was going on, Idk if I can take these two serious in a movie like this lol Both good actors but for example if Samuel L. Jackson says Motherf****r even once I'm gona die laughing and won't be spooked by the movie anymore so it defeats the purpose lol
They ran out of ideas so they just decided to Kirby up the major actors and get them to do a Saw movie and I, for one, am with it.
Horrible cast never gonna watch it
I’m scared 😱
So acab the movie and only black cops can be redeemed?
Oh god another fucming saw movie.......get some new ideas
Rap for the theme of a thriller movie... yeah... That’s... uh, just terrible.
All I picture is Marty from Madagascar screaming at a bunch of cops 🤣
Looks like the corniest movie ever.  But I'll watch it because Chris Rock and Sam Jackson.
Man being strapped up like that is a whole new level of freaky 😵
An urban thriller Saw spin off(pardon the pun) where the victims seem to be exclusively cops( potentially corrupt cops) releases in 2021... This will cause no issues whatsoever
I shy away from the actors like rock. I can only see him as a comedian 😂
Hell yeah 💯🔥
Congratulations, you've made the first SAW property I have zero interest in
Chris Rock Looks dope in this! Deff will be watching this.
Damn that looks good 👍🏿
Ok Marty
O look the bad guy is the female detective... there movie solved
All I’m hearing is Marty’s voice
Batman should be in this finding jigsaw
Ewwww this new jigsaw voice and pattern is not it
I’m not gonna be able to watch this because I keep on tuning out thinking about Madagascar.
I can't take the new saw voice seriously
I can understand why people dislike it but the killers voice changer in this movie just sounds so much more unsettling
This shit fye Chris Rox lol 🕺🏾🌀🖤🎭
We still doing this franchise?  SERIOUSLY?????
Remember when Saw 3D: The Final Chapter was the last movie?
Looks like typical satanic garbage to me, no thanks.
I think this intesity of emotions will be under estimated in this movie..seems like it will start off humorous then get very very tragic and be a true anxiety roller like the previous ones.
SNL said this movie was gonna be called Seen’t 🤣
I am very excited for the movie
Mehhh
I accidentally clicked on this at max volume and the loud screeching in the beginning scared the shit outta me
Chris better not make me laugh during this shit
This is gonna be terrible. Flop written all over it.
👀 interesting can’t wait 😁 I like when Chris attempts 2 b serious 😄😂🤣
I saw the truck and my brain thought......mmm Dreamcast
Ohhhhhhh this....THIS is gonna be a good one.
This is going to be the first good Saw movie in a LONG time
Honestly, I couldn’t even watch saw. I was a little bitch...😂 i gotta watch that movie with like 6 people. 2 people ain’t enough.
All I hear is a zebra.
Wow
I am not feeling this at all. Putting two actors known as comedians in a  huge scary movie like “Saw”... not interesting at all.
YOOO
I know it’s gonna be a lot of “mothafuckas” from Sam L on this one lol
First Adam Sandler, then Kevin James, now Chris Rock with a serious role. Who’s next? David Spade and Rob Schneider.
This is the happiest moment of my entire life.
The trailer didn’t really tell anything but  a fan of both Chris rock and Samuel Jackson so I’ll watch
Did anybody else notice that he could have just used the saw to cut the cuffs? That type of saw is made for cutting exactly that type of material.
Lol this shits so fucked up
Mumble rap, Chris rock screaming, worst voice actor in the known universe as Jigsaw...can Samuel Jackson save it?!
Omg they made the zebra from madagascar into a real person
We don’t need more saw movies. But I’ll be Damned if my not happy as a clown to see some new saw movies!!!
Good to see black Americans leading rolls like they should be 😂
Sometimes a comedian should stay a comedian lol
Gonna be trash just like the last 20
Im sorry I can't take his serious face seriously 🤣🤣🤣
Samuel L Jackson plays Chris Rock's father... Yeah I could believe that. Lol
I could never take Chris Rock serious! 🤣
They should just ignore saw. He will just get bored
No way i can take him serious in a horror movie. Hard pass!
That looks like it's going to be good
The Fucking ZEBRA Has Got a Movie.....sometimes you can't just do all Movies.....
Looks really good but I feel like the emotions displayed by the characters vocal projections is gonna throw the movie off...like the lion king
Chris rock? Really? Guess grown ups 3 was put on hold
I can't take Chris Rock seriously.
Can’t wait Chris rock already looking like a great actor
max minghellas character is the bad guy i figured it out already. (or alternatively in a twist it could be chris rock) either way movie looks kinda shit
"when was the last time you saw your father?"- the movies plot twist...
Bruh the zebra from Madagascar grew into his own
I can't believe osmosis jones gets to play cop again!
“Buy tickets now” Yeah, if you’re lucky enough to live in an area that still has theatres. I’ve seen every single Saw movie (including Jigsaw) in theaters the day it came out and then covid killed all the theatres in my area.
Jjsimpson
I don’t get what some people are saying about this newer trailer...I think it still looks pretty decent. I haven’t enjoyed a Saw movie since the 2nd one (with all of the people locked on the house together) and this one looks more similar to what drew me in about the first two instead of what drove me away from the franchise with the rest of them being mostly focused on twisted gory visuals and less so on the plot. Not that there wasn’t any creative choices in writing ever in any Saw film after Saw 2 just that the twisty turny mystery was kind of secondary after the extremely gory death scenes that felt like someone with real mental issues and desire to kill came up with them.   So I am crossing my fingers this reboot of the franchise gets back to the roots of what everyone liked about the first couple films! PLUS I LOVE THE CAST!! Sam Jackson, Chris Rock, and the incredibly handsome Max Minghella (from the Handmaids Tale).
Oh nooo, he’s just always talking like that XD  I thought it was just played up all the time
https://youtu.be/slMub4NtrSk
Is this an SNL parody trailer?
0:37 Sus 😳
It feels like a different movie and I feel Samuel's and Chris's acting styles will do more than enforce that. After mr rocks performance in fargo I know drama and serious roles aren't a issue with him.
It’s going to be the female detective/captain. If it’s not good use of using a female voice for spiral when it’s a man.
I’m rooting for Chris rock to take a role out of comedy. Hope it’s successful.
Killers a woman.. possibly the lead characters mother. Movie end. 😎
More demonic movies...
Omg Chris he could be saying nothing! 😳and am still 😅laughing
I was gonna say “I can’t wait for dead meat to do a kill count” but then I saw that dead meat already commented
Soon, the games will begin to spiral out of control...
Can't wait.
They just can’t stop making Saw movies even though only the very first one was decent. 😆
Chris rock tryin to act tough is hillarious 😆
It’s so weird seeing Chris rock so serious
This looks really really bad...forreal
nick    kaleb kelly viriyavong's friend ( saw 4  2007 comedy movie bell )
Boring repetitive no new ideas crap
"He could be anywhere!  He could be anyone!"  *Doesn't notice voice changer can't cover female inflection*
First trailer I ever fast fwd thru due to CR voice.
Seent!!!!
“I thought Jigsaw was dead” is starting to get up there with “I want to play a game” in terms of quote usage in the saw series
I'm sorry but Chris Rock can not be in a serious movie with his voice.
Butters
plot twist: the dad is the killer
I never thought the Saw franchise would land a casting like this. Very impressive that it got there. However, I'm pretty sure there's a massive spoiler for the entire movie in this trailer, which I won't point out. I hope I'm wrong.
Running down the stairs like a Spiral......spiral spiral spiral Spiral..
How dumb do the police have to be? There's an unknown package left out front of the police station. They are clearly terrified of it. So Chris Rock creeps up to open it with his hands. No EOD unit, no attempt of bomb disposal.  Hey, let's open it right there in the police precinct so if there is a bomb, you get maximum casualties. The problem with ALL SAW movies is that the mastermind is the Devil, with unlimited power and budget, and all other characters in the movie are special needs people with no brains.
2:22 Is that Jigsaw's personal favorite trap "The Rack"?
ler's play a game
SO EXCITED HOLY SHIT
I bet all this is being done by Gideon Kramer.... and at the end it's gonna show that John Kramer was raising him all along to carry his legacy
Not to be a conspiracy theorist but 1:13 and 2:17 are the same word for word. Inside man maybe?
cant wait ... i think it'll be epic ><
This is a new saw movie??
what a way to ruin the trailer with that rap shit
please tell who was the stupid guy who created the "trailer for the trailer in the trailer" thing, so i can punch him in the face
cant wait for this one..kudos to those movie producer that keeps showing new movies even the possible box office resulrt will be affected by covid..
I can't believe Marty Became a Cop.
Hey isn't that guy comedian
I Knew it i see that picture is John Kremer
2004 - 2021
Evolution Of Saw - Spiral
The games reboot
Another franchise entry I didn't saw that coming
Spiral may top the first two entries of this franchise. Zeke and Marcus remind me of Detective Matthews and his son Daniel, but more complicated. The nods to revisiting old locations of traps is so cool and it keeps the legacy alive. John may be dead, but one scene from Jigsaw clearly has me thinking... on how this copycat killer will outdo his engineering. The music and story plot are brand new, it will likely be very scary compared to the mindless gorefest sequels of 5-7. This entry will likely end on a cliffhanger, as Saw 10 is currently in development. May 14th will be a great day in this miserable year. 👮‍♂️🐷👤
Everything is q remake these days. I guess this worth my money
Day 5 watching this until the movie comes out
junji ito was here
Dude, they got Bonzai Buddy to voice Jigsaw, sweet
I was worried, but this actually looks really good
日本人おる〜？？✋
Hold up when they say the jigsaw killer is dead does this mean they found Logan out or Logan’s game still hasn’t been found
Samuel L. Jackson in a SAW movie, hell yeah!
I just watch this movie for his voice.. marty's voice
all the movies I seen with Samuel Jackson in them he's usually the one that's done it
I’ve always knew Hermione Lodge was up to something... 🤯

Day 3 of watching this until the movie comes out
Trap Song? 1:20
Add this to another series Jackson is in😂
All i hear is marty from Madagascar
Day 2 of watching this until the movie comes out
Marty + Nick Fury + Saw ("This is gonna go sideways fast")
show de bola !!!!!
YESYESYES 🌀🌀🌀
I feel like Chris Rock's still telling a joke when he says something.
The dad did it
I can't WAIT for this to come out.
Does the new voice remind anyone else of Linus from Sharkboy & Lavagirl? LMAO
The most unbelievable thing about this trailer is Sam Jackson playing Chris Rock’s dad. They're like 15 years apart in age.
OMG CHRIS ROCK HOLDING THE HACK SAW I'M SO EXCITED
Day 1 of watching this until the movie comes out
I saw this trailer before watching king kong vs godzilla and it was amazing
Why no Tobin Bell? >:C
👍🗿 ждем !
I'm gonna give this movie a chance. This movie will give Chris Rock & Samuel L. Jackson the chance to do something out of their normal comedic and action roles. I actually look forward to seeing this and seeing what Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson bring to the franchise.
The new voice of jigsaw is just a text of speech girl version but they made it more deeper
And they said this wouldn't have any connection to the SAW movies or its stories. This def is connected to the other Saw movies and the storyline. I hope the killer is not John's Wife getting surgical faces put on her to commit the crimes or somehow the killer did some weird surgery to make himself look like Chris Rock's father to commit all the crimes.
2:03, does anyone think this could be the door to the bathroom!?
So.. when does he start telling jokes in this?
NO MORE SAW MOVIES. Also we need new black actors/comedians from the US.
I'm callin' it Tiffany Hadish is Jigsaw
I hope Hoffmann will come back, if not in this film, at least in future films.
The bl4ck seinfield.
when I saw Chris Rock I thought this is a parody movie like scary movie hahahaha
🤔Is it just me or does Jigsaw/Spiral's modulated voice sound like Bill Gates? 🤪😂
Imo the persons voice in the tapes sounds like a girl maybe it could be Amanda Ik she got shot but maybe she some how lived Idk I’m prolly wrong
why am i waiting for a punch line whenever chris rock talks in this trailer?
1-4 movies are good, 5 is ye ok, 6-7 are bs, 8 is meh
Let me guess, Chris Rock is the new cop-killing villain because they are racist and he can't do anything with them otherwise
too bad Tobin bell isn't in this
Looks nice, waiting for this! Hope it will be better than the last movie about Saw (Jigsaw).
did he buy the voice changer from Wish or...
Great! Now, I’m going to have to re-watch all the Saw movies. I have a full-time job and a family. I ain’t got time bro!
Ayo that 21 savage song go hard
Two of my favorite actors playing in one of my favorite series. Can hardly wait for this.
retribution derives from a personal motive? so the new villain is just Jigsaw wanna be
The voice of the new jigsaw is soft :(  I was expecting a strong deep voice like the previous parts..
Admittedly this would be a bit stretched but my brother had a theory that what If this is actually taking place in the events of saw 3D and the twist at the end is Chris rock character goes to the bathroom opens it and sees mark Hoffman in his chains, stretched yes would I hate it no
Omg, I wanna watch this! This looks so amazing! I've been waiting for a movie from you guys for awhile, but the only thing is, I don't like how that guy sounds with that deep voice in that tape.
Oh please, PLEASE let Chris Rock be the same cop from Lethal Weapon 4, on the case because Jigsaw killed Riggs and Murtaugh...
Looks interesting. Before i saw the all episode (1-7 and jigsaw) of this movie.
Excited for this one Chris Rock doing something different!
marty(madagascar) & nick fury(mcu) vs jigsaw
all i hear is marty from madagascar
1:51 Is he entering the original bathroom from the first Saw movie?
Wow chris rock is shit
I'm always down for a Saw movie! Bring it on. Looks decent!
What has the world come to where we have mini trailers of a trailer before the trailer?
So y'all showing love to downtown Minneapolis
Why does the entire trailer feel so robotic? It is so generic like wtf
The new voice sounds WAY more creepy and unique. it sounds completely normal, thats why
Looks crap
Please Tamil dub  I'm waiting❤️❤️❤️
Isn’t this supposed to be a reboot?
#Wewantindianlanguages
Now if the threw Samuel Jackson in this and have him as the Spiral Killer that would be a twist no one would see coming.
The director has watched too much naruto.
Did it come out already
It’s gonna take some getting use to not having Tobin Bell’s iconic Jigsaw voice but the text to speech voice sounds very uncanny and terrifying so I can get behind this change.
I honestly can't tell if this looks really good or really bad. I almost wish the roles of Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson were reversed, and Rock was like the comic relief friend or something.
So... we not gonna talk about how nick fury is in the movie as Chris rocks dad okie dokie
That voice ruins the little chance this movie had to be scary
I hope there is no vengeful background for  this new Saw
Is Lawrence finally coming back for this one??
What happen to Hoffman in bathroom?
Ok, i just hope that what we heard ISN'T the actual voice from the tapes.... Because it's really pathetic. And also, please, don't let that photo cameo be the only Tobin Bell we get in this movie.
I liked the SAW movies, but for me, 7 was the end.  It bookends the series well.  Then they just wanted to keep going on with it so we got Jigsaw and now this.  I bet it won't do all that well, especially since SAW usually came out for Halloween and this is a summer film.
The trailer looks amazing! Where was this movie filmed?
Dont know if Chris Rock was the right man for the job. Some of the acting in this trailer is cringe, but I'm going to watch it anyways. Hopefully he proves me wrong but Denzel seems like someone fit for this type of role.
what happened to the original voice of the tapes
Wait, what.... I would have never, in a million years, associated Chris Rock with the Saw franchise
I've been watching the trailer four times and I think I know who is the jigsaw copycat. 1:13 to 2:16 that guy might be the jigsaw copycat, you wanna know why? because they have the same line "when was the last time you saw your father" I don't know if I'm right or wrong but I guess that guy might be the jigsaw copycat. If Detective Banks (aka Chris Rock) saw this trailer he would go "ah ha I finally know who's the jigsaw copycat you may spoiled the movie but you solve the case and I thank you for that" and I will say "ahh you're welcome it was just a guess?".
So Samuel L. Jackson is supposed to be Chris Rock's father?! It's mathematically possibly I suppose but kinda absurd. They could be brothers.
I never care for the "saw series" so don't suspect me to see a spoof of another jigsaw classic so I'll sit this one out

Do you know what's striking? The return of the director / screenwriter Darren Lynn Bousman, who co-created Saw 2,3 and 4. The camera is operated in a similar way, with traps and atmosphere resembling the first parts. This can be a very good part after bad "Jigsaw" from 2017 year :D
I'm gonna keep an eye on this one.
Why is chris rock in a horror movie though
Looks pretty good, buuut WE STILL DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO DETECTIVE HOFFMAN !! Last thing happen was he got chained up in the saw 1 bathroom
Max Minghella = <3
That last shot- I can’t imagine how he’s supposed to get out
everyone saying Chris Rock is comedy to serious movie, has never seen New Jack City and it shows.
There'll never be the death of this franchise. Every time they create another, they have loads of source material to work on for years.

I’d never pictured Chris Rock in a serious role
This looks SO GOOD. From what I can tell, it'll be a really nice mix of new characters and story while paying homage to the universe and style established in the series. Can't wait.
Interesting , before 8 parts was good 👌🏻👌🏻
No way I'm gonna take Chris Rock serious in this movie
Kinda wished the used a voice changer to make it deeper like in saw, the high pitched thing isn't creepy
Never seen Chris Rock in a horror movie before
jigsaw: Let the game begin! Samuel L Jackson:  Join the Avengers.

Wtf is the puppets new voice 😐
this feels like a low-budget film, but it ain't.
I saw Chris Rock and I had to click immediately
That was just a diversion to get us out of the priest thing!
There’s still no sex in the champagne room
There’s still no sex in the champagne room
I swear Chris Rock needs to start smoking 12 packs of cigarettes a day to change that cartoony ass voice that he has. lmfao  GREAT ACTING! Hilarious voice mos def
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
tfuj stary
I can’t get Marty from Madagascar out of my head after hearing Chris Rocks voice.
Spiral comes out in my birthday
It’s Actually a Comedy
Live or Die Make your choice  The game has begun
I hope that Alex, Melman and Gloria are ok. Marty doesn't seem in a good shape here.
Hell yeah . . .
I'm sorry Chris Rock don't fit in this movies
I Know One Thing... They Better Not Cancel This!!! Cuz Im Tryna See It!!!!
I saw the pig head and I internally screamed.
How can i take this movie serious with Chris Rock's voice...and his obvious acting to make his face kinda not funny..
_new games that I expect from the movie a lot of deaths, action and horror. do not change the doll. are ready to play live or die
que bien actua romeo santos
I can’t take Chris seriously without seeing a zebra.
Spoilers for Jigsaw     But we already know that there's another apprentice at the end of that movie who just so happens to work with the police So why wouldn't we assume it's that same person continuing Jigsaws work in this movie? And I'm sure that the twist will be it's someone totally different But like why set up a new apprentice if you aren't going to use him
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THIS SONG IN THE BACKGROUND IS CALLED
I can’t take Chris rock serious smh
Anyone thinking the new killer is Chris Rock's Partner? And he's Detective Eric Matthews son, Daniel? (The young white guy) (the kid from Saw 2) ... They're targeting police, and the new doll is a pig and a cop uniform. And then he's targeting a son and a father. Maybe he blames the police department for letting his father die?   Let's see.
0:57 Yeah, he DEFINITELY found a body in there...

21 savage sound trackk😳😳😳😳
Plzz dont change or jigsaw
Looks like Samuel L. Jackson is headed for another Deep Blue Sea...
Oh yeah!!
Idk why people r hating on Chris Rock he looks clean af in this
SAW in Da Hood
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING ORIGIONAL?
I love all the saw movies 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don’t forget Dr.Gordon is still out there
I cant help that everytime I heard Chris Rock's voice I remember Zebra from Madagascar.
When I heard about a new saw film I was disappointed.... but after watching the trailer, it looks promising!
Spoiler alert. It's actually Lt. Butters from lethal weapon 4. 20 yrs later after his wife and kids have left him. Riggs is dead. Murtagh is lost at see with leo fishing and catching tiger sharks.
looks good i'm betting the copy cat is a woman though
Zeke (Chris Rock) and his partner are basically Adam & Dr. Gordon but as cops. And Marcus (Sam L. Jackson) is possibly the new Tapp in this movie.
I've never been excited for a saw movie in my life until now. I like different stuff. To see Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson in a saw movie is very new and different.
Yikes ... Chris Rock just won't do it for me as serious protagonist.
LMAO WTF IS THAT SOFT ASS JIGSAW VOICE💀
I think the killer is the mom from riverdale.
I thought this was gonna be a comedy or a parody.
Everybody Hates Chris  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
its max mingella or his partner. he robbed him and his family while he was a kid and now he grew up and wants revenge for him killing some of his family, as we can see the little kid that chris rock tells to be quiet looks exactly like max mingella.
So this is a continuation, and not a reboot?🤔
This looks really solid, maybe the franchisee has hope again from the director of 11 - 11 - 11, but crazier things have happened. So, let's see.
21
I think voice in the tape is creepy as hell. Looks like a.i. generated voice, with wrong and strange intonations a bit. Good choice, really.
Huge saw fan. Enjoyed all 1 through 8. This is going with my collection 😤👍
so awkward SLJ playing Chris Rock's character's dad
Can’t wait to watch this.       On the Kill Count
If the accomplice is somehow in this movie I'm thinking its the rookie cop cause he just magically appears and is working alongside the main character, the accomplice is going to be the person what you least expected, or it's going to be some minor character that'll have one or two lines or that's in the background.
I wonder if it's the jigsaw accomplices from previous films. The only ones that are alive are Dr. Gorden and Logan that we know of. I still believe Adam and Amanda are still from the first few films or it somehow connected with the videos games either way I'm all in for it
Wow this looks shit, and as always Chris rock plays shouty Chris rock, but this time looking like some old dude who thinks they are street. Chris rock was always a very embarrassing black dude, like the one who would get picked last at a cool black dude party.
Let me guess Chris Rock saves the day... no thanks. 🤮
Voice Changer sounds awful but the Movie still looks great.
💜
New saw hell yeah 💪🏽
The edit in this trailer is beautiful!
This could be good, this could be garbage,”
Looks pretty good
the new voice is so fucking bad, but is saw so letsgooo . PORTUGAL
I did not expect this. It’s weird seeing Chris rock in a scary movie.
2:00 ok, we good.
1:52 Gentleman?
Somehow the kermit voice is even the scarier then the smoker voice, and I don't know why.
I am SO excited to see what this has to offer!!!
Watz the name of that 21 savage song
THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.
Great!!!!
I hope this movie does well because it seems goof. But ONLY in theaters. That's bold Lionsgate.
So from the trailers, I think the new jigsaw is targetting specific cops. In the last trailer, chris rock said that the victims have all been police officers. Knowing jigsaw has never targeted randomly, unless they were all complicit in a crime or disaster together.  I think jigsaw is killing corrupted cops who really messed someone up. And Detective banks was the one in charge of committing those crimes. And now someone wants revenge.   I think it's the partner.
WHO TF IS THATTTTTTT!!!🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨😕😕😕 0:31
This actually looks so stupid lmfaoooo
YES ACTION.....
I prefer the original theme of Saw.
5 millions of visits in less than 3 days?  "Samuel L. Jackson: this shit will go sideways fast"
Is the whole movie gonna be his white coworkers gaslighting him the whole time? He shouldn't have to convince other cops to help catch a cop killer.
Should’ve called it “Black Saw”.
I'm calling it now, Detective Banks (Chris Rock) is going to be the Jigsaw copycat, I hope I'm wrong tho
OOOOH DAMN !
I NEED EVERYONE ON THIS CASE
I can't wait for this movie
Wait, this isn't an April Fool's joke? Damnit...
Ich freuhe  mich 😍
Why can't I stop laughing tho😆  This will either be all a joke, or none of it is😌😂
If any of you all remember the the last Saw movie from 2017, Dr. Logan Nelson was revealed to be Kramer’s successor. Obviously he’s Spiral! 🙁
I'd really thought this was a April Fools joke. This movie really happening?
Can't take Chris Rock seriously...I'm sorry
another good saw movie 👍👍👍👍
looks shitty
Shit is teasing me
never thought i'd see Marty from Madagascar and Saw together
Osmosis Jones in a saw movie.
Dude, how long until a real life copycat of this
I know Master P biopic King of the South movie Coming soon 2021
I know this is possibly scary or whatever but honestly the funniest thing about this trailer is the dude boys it sounds like bang from Batman the dark Knight and it’s just  Funny to me
I'm all for a movie with Chris Rock and Samuel l Jackson but this saw movie franchise has to stop at some point...I think I stopped watching them after like #4 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ and to be honest I'm only CONSIDERING to watch this one bc of CR and SLJ
I am Turkish
I am from  T Ü R K İ Y E
Turkey ❤
I love you jigsaw 😉
21 savage🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥))
Will this also be released on a streaming service anywhere?  Most movie theaters are closed in Ontario.
they are many jigsaw like dr Gordon and dr logon and dr Elenore suspect
like detective Hoffman : in my legacy will become yours
Play On TV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me guess they all gonna die and game over
I can't wait to watch this trailer over a hundred or two hundred times between now and the release
The movie should be related with gordon, hoffman and amanda. Without adding them into story the saw myth is meaningless
I swear, if it's his partner/captain/whoever the guy was that asked him "When's the last time you've seen your father?", I'm gonna pissed that they gave that away in the trailer.
This looks creepy! What a great pairing.
saw 6 is the best out the series..agree or nah?
Max Minghella is the killer. For sure.
IM SO EXCITED SAW FRANCHISE IS MY FAVORITE I LOVE THE SAW MOVIES MY FAVORITE IS SAW 1 I LOVE THE NEW ONE
It’s hit if Chris Rock in it.
I'm really sorry but all I hear and see is Marty the zebra 🤥
I feel like every line Chris Rock says in this movie would just crack me up lol
This might be good, but Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson in a Saw movie really sounds like a Whose Line is It Anyway prompt.
Then a Sonic puppet comes out on a tricycle telling the contestants that they gotta go fast.  Twist ending, Doctor Robotnik is the killer.
Marty? Alex? Marty! Alex! MAAARRTY! ALLLEEEX! -A Zebra
Pootie Tang 2 looks weird
Yeah Chris Rock. Impressive take on a serious role for a change. This looks great.
Hope Tobin Bell is back in this somewhere somehow, otherwise it just looks a cash grab and nothing special.
In Chris Rock's Donkey voice: "Jigsaw, I thought you were my friend"!
21 savage ❤️
#Gematria
I know this might live up to the hype, but they gotta let the SAW franchise get its well deserved rest. what is left untold after all those SAW movies anyway? still gonna watch this though.
when i watched the part where Chris Rock says "he could be anywhere, he could be anyone" in my head after that i heard "he could be shaking the Tambourine!"
I’m calling the twist right now, Chris Rock is doing the killings in this film.
At least Chris rock is in shape unlike Martin Lawrence
I'm lookin forward to this. All other SAW movies were awesome.
is .. is that a pig puppet.
this will never not read as a spoof to me. I will watch tho
If only Marty the Zebra from Madagascar was in it then it would be original and worth watching. But it just looks like the same old bullshit! 😂
in theaters may 12?   im not going to any theater
21
Can't wait to see❤
They're should've gotten Laurence Fishburne to play Chris Rock's partner.
Chris Rock sound ridiculous, like delivering a joke with no punch>
Who came her because of ramsey 👋🔥
Yawn
Probably should've choose different actor haha.. can't take him serious
at least we all know its a girl whos talking
1:21 what is that song ?
Looks TRASH
Aye das hard but I don’t imagine Chris rock as a serious character 😂
Nick stop trying to find copycat Jigsaw and go protect June and Hannah!!!!
The cast was enough for me yaaas!! Samuel L was enough for me lol can’t wait!
Yo is my boi chris ramsay in this movie?
Chris rocks serious acting is kinda cringy but the saw franchise was hardly known for its acting anyways. Hopefully it has some good shockers!
Stood in the kitchen hearing the tv from next door and all I could hear was the zebra from Madagascar in distress.
I thought this was some kind of comedy spoof. There is just something about Chris Rock's voice I can't take serious. 😂
Damn it I thought we were going to get a serious performance out of jackson, rather than that cardboard "fictional version of himself actor" he's become.  I want more from my favourite actor than just the typecast you have become. I think your performance will degrade Chris rocks attempt at doing a serious roll
Lowkey doesn’t seem the same anymore y would they change the puppets laugh
What's the bet Amanda isn't actually dead or Hoffman survived the whole time
Stop the Asian hate
20$ it’s the female cop all along  so yea  boom seeetru
Nick Fury , Mace Windu... Jigsaw gonna get you
I wish this movie will be in Hindi and Telugu language....  Love ❤️  from india.....
Oyyyyyy
very awesome can't wait I've been a bigfan of SAW / JIGSAW
Not really interested in the saw films but this looks more interesting like saw meets seven
Bruh tell me why I thought it was a comedy  at first
Chris Rock is gonna have to do some _fantastic_ acting to overshadow his hilarious voice lol
It's going to be hard for me to take chris rock serious in this movie but I want to see this.
It's gonna be a bit weird seeing Chris Rock in such a serious role, but I have really high hopes for this movie. Crossing my fingers
He keeps saying "HE COULD NE ANYBODY" but it's obviously a woman.
Y'all really expect me to take Chris Rock seriously? LOL
Ulan baya iyi he keşke Türkiye'de de bu tarz filmler  çıksa
Struggling to take Chris Rock serious.
if the cops were genre savvy: "ok everyone draw long guns.  Stay together in full gear in groups no smaller than 10 people.  That includes the bathroom.  Don't let the killer take one of us.  Let's call the FBI for help."
Not gonna knock it til I try it. Looks like a refreshing take on this series. Let’s gooooo
That laugh in the end creeped me out
Looks wack the same isht as the others. SAW jump off.
Oh man, look at that diverse cast, not one competent white man in sight!
Nope over this series
This looks really good I love everything saw

This should be funny
i thought chris rock was supposed to direct this
is it Will Powers?
i didnt know Darren Lynn Bousman was returning. this is gonna be good.
This actually looks good!!! I hope John makes a small cameo 🤞🏽
John Kramer promised his games would keep going on and he was absolutely right.
Looks like Saw 1 vibes
It's weird seeing Chris Rock at a horror movie
Holy shite!  This looks like SE7EN!
Who is here after citizen z
Hhahahahahhahaha just wowwwwww...Hollywood 100% out of original ideas
When was the last time you saw your father?
I am pretty excited about spiral
Is it just me who's tired of these ads with the same structure and already feels like not watching the movie?
I only hear donkey
The police puppet dressed as a pig at the end, interesting!
This feels like an SNL skit featuring Chris Rock
LETS GOOO
Executive Producer?! 😀 YES!
"I'm tired of these motha fuckin games in this motha fuckin warehouse !!!"
Looks like Amanda Young who was Jigsaw's disciple is getting her own movie finally which seems appropriate after all she is Dead by Daylight.
1:13 and 2:17 Same line
Is It' going to be a cult this time? That's the vibes I got from this.
Jigsaw would have put lionsgate execs in a saw puzzle for milking the franchise like this. Just put an end to this already. It's been 2 decades guys!
Hoffman 🤔 I know they said he was dead but he was the only FBI agent left
This actually looks pretty solid.
“i thought the jigsaw killer was dead”  when will they stop saying that fucking line we already know...
I hope it’s clever and not gorey
I gave up on the last couple Saw movies but this one does look intriguing,Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson being in this does make me want to watch it.
Been waiting on this movie for forever... did they even release the new Candyman yet? It’s like the trailer was floating around then it just nothing
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
The Dreamcast confirmed! SEGA rocks 🪨
How the heck did they get Samuel L Jackson and Chris Rock for this movie.
Jim Carey thriller. Chris Rock thriller 🤔
They showing too much.
It looks damn amazing...cant wait to see this after a long year of extra waiting...really looks like Chris Rock and Bousman created something very special with this one.
Everybody hattttteeeeeeeres Chrissssss
Hard pass for me bruhhh
Chris Rock’s yelling made me lol
It’s gonna be weird seeing a former Zebra as a serious detective
It's gonna be hard to watch chris rock dying in a brutal way lol
lmao
Whoever the killer is, they must be a huge Sega fan to use the Dreamcast logo as their calling card
Suco de fruta virou policial é? kkkkkkkkkkkkk
It looks stupid.
FLASH FACT: Both Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Rock were offered to play the lead roles in a Sanford and Son movie during the 1990s.
I love this but in the back of my head it’s screaming...”MARTY” 😭💀
I deadass can’t take it serious at all with the new robot ass mediocre jigsaw tape voice lol, or the fact that billy isn’t in it anymore.  All I know is the theme song better be a new badass version of zepp
To be honest, I didn't feel scared by this trailer, like the last movie. I think that part of what scares the audience is the dark, dirty and claustrophobic envyroment that the other 7 movies have.
Using the Dreamcast symbol is quite laughable
I'm sorry I can't take chris rock seriously
OMFG THIS COMES OUT ON MY FRICKING BIRTHDAY AHHHHHH
Bravo Hollywood another sadistic filth for the mentally deranged society
Chris Rock is the new diversity hire? Wow like stop please. Stop
If this was a portrayal of Junji Itos uzumaki Spiral, would’ve been sickkkk
Girl, who ordered this movie? And why?
Lookin like Tech9
I can’t trust nobody in this precinct!!!
Never saw saw hopefully never will. Don't like puppet things being weird.
just saw this on a youtube ad, I am STOKED
chris rock = commissioner gordon... better call the batman

Chris rocks voice.... I just can’t take him serious. lol
Chris Rock is one of those comedians that can't do different genres, mainly because he's so good at what he does his voice alone recalls memories from his past performances in comedic roles. I'll just never be able to look at him and believe that he is that character
Need a Tupac I get around scary version for the background music like they did the US movie
The puppets laugh reminds me of Marx from “Kirby Super Star Ultra” anyone else?
Philadelphia!!!
i always think of chris rock as the zebra ALWAYS!!!
Damn y’all this movie is gunna make house party look like house party 2!
Wish this was a ring sequel
muito bommm
Chris Rock & Samuel L Jackson in a horror movie? Take my money.
Yassss I can’t wait to see this saw was the best horror movie every last one
Apakah ini film komedi?
Kinda looks like shit honestly 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope everyone enjoys the upcoming Passover and Feast of Unleavened bread, Halleluyah.  Numbers 9:2  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.  Exodus 23:15  Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty.
Idk his voice makes me anticipate a joke.
I bet this will set up the multiverse and show how Nick Fury lost his eye
Why do I feel like I have been waiting for this film for forever

This new Jigsaw voice is so uncomfortable and unusual, only John Kramer's voice gives me *the* chills. That aside though, seems like a nice movie. Can't wait!   P.S. I miss Billy the puppet :(
Max Minghella is the only reason I clicked  😍😍😍😍😍
It's so funny that Jigsaw was dead for like over half of the original franchise and these guys are like "i ThOuGhT hE wAs DeAd"
I wonder what is happening at 2:05 it looks like he is covered in some kind of blue substance
or yea a new game starts
Movie looks good, however the editing in this trailer does not. Who puts hip-hop in a JIGSAW related movie? No one until now...
I can't see chris's rock as a serious actor. It just looks wired and kills the vibe lol
They gave away who the killer is in the trailer tho imo. Or it's put in on purpose to make us think its the guy who says "when is the last time you saw your father?" It's him or the girl. Hands down.
Why do they keep making these movies!!!! But I know I’m going to watch it like the good saw trash goblin I am. Like fuck!!!!
I wonder what funky traps we're gonna see in this one
It’s hard seeing Chris as a serious character after all his comedies
Where is the original soundtrack?
It’s obvious the mastermind killer is a woman
I honestly thought this was a movie based on the Junji Ito manga series.
What it’s called: Spiral: From the book of SAW What it actually is: SAW 8: But possibly better
Looks awesome but Tobin Bell better be in it even for just a cameo
can't take chris rock serious or that voice on the phone
I'm definitely gonna watch this.
This killer will speak for the deads?
I can only think of Marty when I hear his voice.
Samuel L Jackson continuing his job as the guy in every movie ever
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I guarantee u Chris Rock is going to be The jigsaw killer I guarantee u can see blood on he’s shirt when he walks out he’s going to be the jigsaw killer also don’t forget he’s the producer of this film he’s very fan of jigsaw last jigsaw movie when he the man walk up he had blood he made it seem like it was another person but it was him that decided to do that game does it make sence now
I was thinking that the movie was gonna end by revealing who the guy was that Amanda killed in the reverse bear trap game. I’m doubting that’s gonna happen now.
Wow, the CGI looks so good. They somehow made Marty look so different in this!
Chris Rocks voice makes saw sound like a comedy.
Plot Twist Samuel Jackson Is The Killer.
Come on! This looks stupid, all I can picture is a zebra in a trench coat looking for clues
They really gonna do my man Samuel L. Jackson dirty like that, smh
Let the games begin...all over again.
8s the original Jigsaw actor attached to this? Didn't sound like the OG Jigsaw
I just can’t take Chris rock seriously.  It just sounds like comedy when he speaks lul.
That voice can only be one person.   Jordan Peterson is the new Jigsaw.  "I'd like you to tidy your damn room... DETECTIVE."
Can’t stop thinking of Madagascar
I’m calling it now... It’s Adam Sandler
Was anybody else waiting for a punchline
I respect their restraint to not have anyone say “I wanna play a game.”
Off offf
Eh, probably would have been better with a different actor for the main role. Chris Rock can't do serious roles, he should've stayed within the comedy roles.
Spiral: In Madagascar
This actually looks like a good movie, not just entertaining and sadomasochistic like the first few. And let's be honest, after that they were terrible. But this, the actual meat(no pun intended) of the movie looks good.
We have good faith in Darren Lynn Bousman.🤞
Oh no this film is doing what terminator dark fate and Star Wars the force awakens did
we don’t really need another saw movie, but this looks pretty good. i’ll definitely give it a chance!
Not trailer if Sam in it and don't show him cussing. Lol I'm in Chris and Sam its worth a watch
I hope Tobin Bell makes an appearance in this movie.
Close your eyes and you'll here marty
This trailer is literally Chris Rock shouting all the way through it. I feel like he's the wrong actor for this role.
I can’t take Chris Rock seriously in a serious role. He must be joking?
Actors been acting to long, that they start producing/directing.
Why u waited us too much
Chris Rock shouts a lot doesn't he
I forgot about this CANT WAIT!
I am fucking hyped. Saw is my childhood favorite franchise
Chris Rock and Sam Jackson. I wonder if anyone says the "F" word in this...
This movie looks promising ! 🔥
Honestly I find the new voice changer really disturbing for some reason. I love it.
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you still can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
This trailer for Uzumaki looks cray cray     And oddly not Japanese.
Can't wait to see it in The Theaters!
Chris rocking trying to sound serious just makes it sound funny my nigga too much of a comedy icon
Ho-wee-sheet!!! Ho-wee-sheet!
Is Tobin Bell gonna make an appearance?
It's an interesting take on Saw
Chris rock is the new jigsaw I’m calling it now!
If anything its gotta be better than the last movie we got
I’m sorry but Chris rock needs a deeper voice 😂
Kind of a lame name for a movie, but I’m hopeful!
Is it just me that isn't sure if this is a parody or not cause of Chris Rock's performance?
I wanna like this movie so bad but the bad screaming and acting makes it hard
Wow this looks twisted
New Jigsaw killer?  *Covid-19: Hold my beer*
I hope we get some Tobin bell action in this, that guy is great
I always wanted to see another side of Chris Rock, without the funny.
This looks dope. Chris' facial acting looks great, but his voice is so friggin ICONIC that it takes me outta it tbh...

After seeing theses me waiting after saw 8
I like the new voice for the killer. It’s just slightly unnerving, which is what you want for Jigsaw.
Damn looks pretty good
Not gonna lie...this looks terrible
It’s always entertaining when comedians get into drama roles.
You can tell that the distorted voice is a woman’s voice.
Badass hell yeah definitely gunna have too see it weather it’s good or not so good I have faith it’s good. 💪🏼🔥
I’m just waiting for the Dreamcast memes
I swear if they pull some “omg this person from the first few movies has been John Kramer’s accomplice this whole entire time 😱” bull crap, I’m gonna commit a hate crime—
all i hear is marty from madagascar when chris rock talks
Broooo this looks so good!!!
They should have made it a stand alone movie and not a Saw movie. It looks decent but literally the last thing we need is another sequel. God damn sequels. There was a time when people made movies because they had a story to tell, not because they wanted to cash in another IP.
Hell yah can’t wait for this. I hope they continue to make these on a yearly basis again it was so much fun going every year.

Oh yeah been waiting for more traps and life changing decisions🦅
Looks amazing, fresh and dark! Can't wait to see it!
That is one seriously rotten bad guy.
Huge saw fan but this looks and sounds horrible :(
I really like Chris Rock but he's doing his comedy rant voice in this so it's hard to take him seriously.
Lemme guess; Chris Rock figures everything out and in attempt to apprehend the killer, end up in his OWN spiral and dies an agonizing, untimely death. 😒 These movies have been beat to death.
this movie is racist!

Ok som... it’s re a thing? Cause the last GOOD one i was ... i was a kid dammit , i’m 28 now . DO NOT MAKE THE KID I WAS ,WHO LOVED SAW 1 , SAD CAUSE...
I hope it is more thriller/detective than just another slasher with tons of screamers
Hopefully this becomes a series like the Saw movies!
This looks awful
It’s been a while since I’ve seen Chris in a big film like this I’m glad he’s getting the attention he deserves, I just hope it’s worth the watch. I’m a busy man
I have all the Saw movies and love watching them. I can’t wait to watch this new movie!
no way im gonna be able to watch this without constantly hearing Marty from Madagascar
I'm still finding it weird that the magician chris ramsay is in this film, covered in blue paint near the end of the trailer.
WHAT'S IN THE BOXX??!
I can’t take Chris rocks voice seriously
So is this not in another universe or not? Because they mentioned that "the jigsaw killer is dead" so does that mean that this happens in the same timeframe as jigsaw? Idfk anymore
show de bola """""
Can’t wait for the theme to inevitably play in the last five minutes of the movie
How is it possible that Chris Rock is still funny when he yells
The Chris Rock lines are so cringe that I think I will actually go see this movie. 😐
Is it me or am I the only one that doesn’t find Chris rock funny.
Everybody gangsta til Chris Rock gets serious
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular? 2. Save the whales. Collect the whole set. 3. A day without sunshine is like, night. 4. I don't find it hard to meet expenses. They're everywhere.  5. Bills travel through the mail at twice the speed of checks. 6. If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried. 7. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges.  8. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep. 9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  10. It's been Monday all week.  Editorial:  Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
Why Samuel why... I mean sure for money but why.... WHat a shame for such an actor
1:13 Lmfaooooo
Spoiler alert: the black guy always dies first but this horror film might change history.
Looks amazing. One question tho, where’s Billy?!
bruh I can't get over Marty being part of saw
I’m such a huge fan of the original movie series. I can’t wait for the next chapter to begin! I’m going to be honest about who I think is behind the “Spiral” character. Just based off this trailer, I wouldn’t be surprise if it isn’t Samuel L. Jackson’s character who is behind all of this. I mean, they show him in one of the contraptions, but that could have been perfectly set up by him. That would be a pretty good twist, especially if he knows that his son would definitely succeed in rescuing him. But I’m just going off a few quick scenes, and just super hyped for the film!
como eu esperei por esse video
Get ready, it's Dead Meat Kill Count time!!!!   (Once this comes out on Blu-Ray)
This movie looks like it's bringing a new take to the Saw movies so I'm very interested.
Do the Saw movies take place in Philly at all? I am not as familiar with all the movies but this trailer clearly has shots of Philadelphia (though I can not find anything in promo material or info stating that is does). A lot of movies and shows have used shots of Philly for {insert fake city name here} but you see a brief look in this trailer of William Penn's statue on top of city hall which is a very distinct landmark (not something you find or would feature in Generic City A).
at first i was like "heheheeheh another SNL PARODY !!" and chris rock"s shouting confirmed it somewhere........... but no....its a godamn movie !!!
I can’t take Chris rock seriously after seen pootie tang lol. But looks interesting
Love Chris Rock 👍💖
316 spirals in trailer
I bet jigsaw’s son ended up living and boom that’s who it is
https://youtu.be/sDAzpO2Boo8  Hey there! I know we don’t know each other but idk if you’ve seen me posting about this recently or not but this is the YouTube series I’m starting. We’re in the process of filming episode 2 soon. I’m super excited about it! If you haven’t done so already you should subscribe to the YouTube channel and follow the IG page. Thanks 🙏🏼   @bmoreindi
I am here for Chris Ramsay! 2:04
I just cant take C Rocks voice serously...
SA山見ながら飯食うまでしてたわ‪w 日本公開は来年くらいかな
everyone’s glossing over the best chris in this movie... chris ramsay
I can't believe I'm going to witness Samuel L Jackson in a Jigsaw trap.
The cast is impressive. Perhaps we will get something interesting.
I love that Chris rock is throwing his hat into a whole different genre.. can’t wait !
My problem with Chris Rock is that he had the same tone of voice in every line from this trailer, idk how serious this guy can sound
Listen to the voice the killer is a woman
it feel so wierd hearin 21 on this💀
😧
It’s gonna be a woman
Last time I saw Rock in something serious that wasn't like a dramedy was New Jack City. Here's hoping for the best out his performance in the movie. Also, will Samuel Jackson get a very nasty death scene?????? He looked like he was in for it based on the last few seconds of the trailer. Yikes! #YesTheyDeserveToDieAndIHopeTheyBurnInHell
The last one was great
ansioso pra ver
Is this Hollywood's adaptation of Uzumaki?
Wow. Chris Rock is actually not a good actor😬
it's gonna suck.
I hope it better than the last saw movie
If you close your eyes while playing the trailer you could almost hear Marty speaking...(da da da daa afro circus afro circus!!)
What’s that song?
Can’t we just let this series die? It was wrapped up after 3d. Just beating a dead horse now.
I LOVE the Saw movies. But I hate those two terrible black token actors! I do not like race hustlers and I do not like black racists!
Impossible to take this movie seriously with Chris Rock in it
I can only think of Marty and a zebra when I see him
Didn’t get a lot from this trailer but I looks really nice
It's the partner cop. Wife and kid died by Rock and crews hands and is seeking revenge
Hmm so chris rock wants to act dramatically so his agent told him to do a saw movie. 1. Because they are oddly successful. 2. No one will remember chris rock did this movie if it kicks off more roles
Ok I’m excited honestly. Hope it’s good and bloody.
Chris Ramsay I see you!!!!!!
So it’s definitely Max Minghella’s character right?
Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross for us 2021 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! Repent and surrender to him. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
Not gonna lie when I saw that the victims were cops I didn't care
Is there gonna be any white actors in the movie?
I REALLY hope, that it'll be just a new Jigsaw Praying, that it won't be Logan, cause this peace of movie called "Jigsaw" should not exist Please, God, let it be a good part of franchise like first 7 films Please, forget about the 8th Please....
Props to Chris rock to bringing saw back into the light
Looks amazing and I was never a huge Saw guy
THAT WAS JUST A DIVERSION.  TO GET US OUT OF THE PRECINCT.  Love it! Chris Rock!
I NEED EVERYONE ON THIS CASE.  HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.  HE COULD BE ANYONE.
It looks GOOD LOOKS GOOD TO ME 👀
Woooow
Chris Rock just doesn’t fit.
eu quero assistir
i can't take chris rock seriously
Thumbnail looks like  NEW JACK CITY 2021  In Pookie we trust
This trailer was phenomenal which means the movie might be compete shit
I bet 5 bucks it’s his partner in the trailer
It’s taken a yeah but worth it
Even the way chris rock speaks, its just so funny. It will be a new experience to see him play a serious character.
*GAS*
muito ansioso pra assitir
Garbage
Junji Ito approves
When Samuel L. Jackson is waiting for you in your living room, it's either that you're about to live the last moments of your life, or that you've just met your future best friend. indeed!
Well, I speak from experience that the best kind of horror is when a comedian does a serious horror movie. So I can not wait to see this ❤💀
Not saw without Tobin Bells creepy voice
so this is after saw 4 i think
„I thought the Jigsaw killer was dead“ ah shit here we go again
Tobin Bell better be in this movie.
This looks so good!
It’s hard for me not to laugh at Chris Rock. Everything he does is just so funny to me. Especially his voice 😂🤣😂
Okay this looks alright
I saw the picture of jigsaw so does that mean it is set in the same universe as the other ones?
🤮
I really like the idea of focusing on the police involved with jigsaw. I feel as though the original 7 movies would have greatly benefited from having a lead police officer opposite jigsaw to help guide the series along
Chris rock, I'm here to play a game.
Tht voice sucks tho, n why tf they changed the doll into a pig doll or sum shit
Hope this connects all the Saw movies in some way that's something we haven't seen yet in the newer films. But that saying all I know is that bones will be crackalackin!!
Hello Detective Banks, We are Dedsec. Join us, the choice is yours.
Good Lionsgate, Remakable Making, keep it in Your every movie......don't want colorless movie
So how many times have we seen Samuel L. Jackson die in movie history? 🤔
looks really good - eager to see Chris Rocks take on this whole universe! love the throwback to the first movie with him chained up with a saw in his hand :P cant wait to see it next month :)
ABONE BLISS
in my head  CANON this is  Sgt. butters from Lethal Weapon 4,  23 yeras later...
Love the color grading and Nice work cinematography! Beautiful. I’m looking forward to watch this.
21 21 21
I’ve been waiting so long for this ! I am so excited
I am with this. 😯
Kinda looks like a spinoff of SE7EN
Just let the franchise die...
Lol how many Saw movies is this now? 10?
*Yeah the horror is back💀*

We already know it’s the young cop, it’s always him in every movie he’s in
it's the guy that murdered George Floyd that's who he is John 8: 44-45🤔
:0
ngl the spiral killer’s voice sounds hella robotic and unsettling, its actually so terrifying
It's that chick, the scrambled voice is clearly female, and she's the only female in the trailer.

Looks Awful.....New Puppet Looks Crazy Weak.....Jigsaw Copycat's Voice Sounds Horribly Dumb  & The Acting Looks & Sounds Bad...Plus There Are Parts That Make It Seems Like A Rehash Of Part 1. Lastly It Will Only Have 1 Week To Really Make Any Real Money Bc There Are Other Better Movies Coming Out On May 21st(Army Of The Dead) And May 28th(A Quiet Place 2) And June 4th Sees Conjuring 3 Coming Out.
1:09 Philadelphia!
wow Chris Rock cant act for sh***t
I forgot about this completely. Will be watching though.
21 21 !
Looks like shit
Tell me why i think Samuel L Jackson is the New Jigsaw
Hope to be able to take Chris Rock seriously when he's yelling.
The movie looks good.  but what's so crazy is the "Spiral"  is a child molester sign.  look it up.
i have a bad feeling this movie is gonna suck
Am I the only one who just realized the trap that Smauel Jackson is in, is puppet strings?
This looks kinda bad but I'm a watch it anyway because it their passion project so it's guaranteed to be entertaining, better than most movies
lol...nah.
OH MY GOD!!! It is so good😍
This movie will either make or break the series!
Wait, I didn’t know Max was in this! I was interested from the start, but now I definitely have to watch it.
1 - WHY DID YOU NOT USE HELLO ZEPP !!! NOTHING ELSE WORKS !!!  2 - WHY IS THE KILLERS VOICE SQUEAKY !  3 - ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS USE HELLO ZEPP !
I almost laughed at every dramatic scene shown with Chris Rock just now... so bad
Rewatched all the saw movies a while back because of this movie and the storyline is like a soap opera
ngl, it looks bad. I mean Chris rock's dialogue alone is really basic and 1 dimensional.
Normally I’d give this film a miss if the virus didn’t ruin the cinema experience, but at this rate I’ll give it a go just to be back there and who knows this film might surprise me
I think the copycat/Jigsaw follower might be a woman because the way how they annunciate their words sounds a bit feminine even with the voice changer.
Sorry I can’t take Chris Rock seriously for some reason I don’t know what it is, his face or his voice is making me laugh
1:14 that guy and killer both asked him when the last time he saw his father. So now I wonder whether that guy is the killer or saw is recording people and altering there voices to mock the detective. Hmmm
Is it just me, or is the killers voice OBVIOUSLY female, with a shitty voice changer? Cause that shortens the list down to one person
I really have this weird feeling that SLJ will die in this film... and Chris also.
Wish they kept the jigsaw voice.
John Kramers Pic is something we see from him and THATS something. the trailer is much more better than the 1st. one
I can not wait to watch it.
When a comedian do a serious role , i just cant take it seriously😂
Imagine miscasting yourself...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa me and friends were just talking about having a saw marathon
I've watched the trailers for some time now in anticipation but I'm still having a hard time accepting and believing Chris Rock's character role due to his great comedy performances. But hey I'll have to wait and see🤷🤞☺️
You see there's 2 types of murderers, there's serial killAS and then there's serial killERS
Samuel L Jackson and Chris Rock.....in one of my favorite thriller franchises? Please tell me this is an April Fools joke.
I wasn’t expecting this to look so good!
I can't take Chris Rock seriously, he's acting like Tommy Wiseau
Why the beat sound like Robot Chicken towards the end lmao
Ok chris rock, get it then.. a serious role. Imma def watch this
Think they will kill it... but man i cant take Chris Rock serious with that voice.... I wAnT EveryONe on this cAase
DREAMCAST IS BACK BABY!!!
I'M IN.
lol Chris Rock
I just hope not plays Everybody hates Chris ending chorus when hate Chris rock dies in this movie 🤦🏾‍♂️
Looks interesting, but seriously….. who TF edited this trailer?
The laugh sounds awful, the voice is like some rip-off anonymous shit and Chris Rock... I just can't take it seriously. It doesn't sound like he's acting, I'm just waiting for a bad joke and then I realize the joke is his acting..
Naruto signs
Is Jigsaw using a text-to-speech generator? At the very least, no one's going to be able to scramble his voice.
This is a must see for sure.
Probably, a new killer is Markus Banks
Song name?
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I really enjoy that they keep making movies from saw, such a great series.
Really looks great
Pretty sure it’s the cult group pigs from the end of Saw 7. When Dr.Gordon stops Detective Hoffman. He has other recruits with him wearing pig masks. So I believe it’s them carrying on the legacy as some cult.
Chris Rock? Nope.
They filmed this in Toronto , I used to work in the film industry and one of my coworkers told me how it ended cuz she was on set. This seems really interesting !
Audio mixing on this spot is excellent.
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you!  = ) Never give up on your life!!
I'm there! This looks real good.
love this
(Saw Alternative Black Version)
looks horrible...
Definitely better than the first trailer.
Something about that Pig Puppet dressed like a Cop makes me think there's something in this film that's gonna make us think twice about who we're rooting for...
This better be a early April Fool's joke...
The ONLY issue I have is Chris rock's voice.. How could I not laugh??
It's Sam Jackson, case closed
I love Chris Rock but I can't take him seriously without laughing
What song is in the trailer
This looks really really good!!
Why  it sounds like the mystery box when it shows the teddy bear and dips on you.
I like that this one looks different then the other ones
The fact that Chris rock is doing a drama suspense is amazing ..obviously Mr Jackson has to be there too
Looks amazing, can’t wait for this!🪚🩸
One can hope that it's decent but... there were a lot of bad Saw movies.
They could have made the voice better
Polka dot polka dot Afro
So the new puppet is Balloon Boy?
Chris Ramsay is Spiral!!!!
Not bad for a "reboot" ? Sequel/reboot? They showed original jigsaws pic.
Alright Marty the zebra.
Dude that track slaps! What is it?
McMurray how're ya now
This movie better be gory. Jigsaw was a disappointment, felt like watching a pg-13 movie.
frankly you guys should pay the saw quotes  twitter for all the marketing theyre doing for you lmao
Can someone explain to me the trailer before the actual trailer is about?
Killer is the girl cop 👮‍♀️
🔥soon the whole world will be listening to my songs
Gracias Lionsgate por estrenarla en mi cumple xd
They got the atmosphere and colouring correct. Def looks much better than I expected
I like how it seems more like a mystery and less about the traps
Pookie and Officer Tenpenny teaming up to face Jigsaw
Are we going to pretend Jigsaw never happened? Because there's already a Jigsaw copycat lol. Unless this connects both movies? Jigsaw was great too. Really hope this movie lives up to the hype of the original series. Wonder if Tobin Bell makes an appearance at all. He was one of the best parts about the original story.
I'm sorry when Chris Rock yells all I envision is Marty from Madagascar
Intense . When was the last time you saw your father?
Jesus H. Fuck! I'm so damn excited to see this movie! 👍👍👍 I love SAW!
I’m hyped, but they did Billy dirty
Ohhhhhh maaannnn I can't wait!👍🏿
Lions gate is a trademark of unique quality films. This seems promising too.
It definitely looks like a way better production than the original ones
fuck is veronica lodge doing in a saw movie
Bad guy is actually a girl
Rocks voice is just too goofy. I can’t not hear the zebra from that one movie.
This is sequel jigsaw ?
Chris Rock’s voice does not fit in this movie lol 😆
This and halloween still getting films while F13, Nightmare, and texas chainsaw are left in the dust, crying.
I’m not sure who’s voice that is but it certainly isn’t even close to Tobin Bell’s. Still excited.
So Im going to speculate already and say its a cop, do to the pig mask. I do like the tone of this. Doesnt look too gory but more of a mystery movie.
When i watched the trailer i see a new sequel from Saw, So why you change the name why isnt it called SAW 9 or maybe because the last movies werent good🙂
Damn the new chapter of Riverdale is surely going serious ways
I cannot wait for the dead meat kill count for this one 😩
Finally a good movie
Sorry but i wont take Chris Rock seriously
Awww this shit gone be good f what yah talking
Great to see Chris Rock in a serious film.😀
Sorry Chris rock but I can’t take you serious...
What in the Kylo Ren?!
I'll watch it. Did I see the Law and order chick here?
Uh where’s Tobin bell. Seriously where is he he’s the only good thing about these movies!
It's coming the day of my birthday
The first trailer was better
Im not a fan of pig head i prefer the creepy doll which is nowhere in this film but i am so excited to see this, most of the saw movies aren't even that good but i always get a kick out of them
Imma miss billy the puppet and the voice of tobin bell saying "i wanna play a game"
God I can't wait.
Pookie the cop
I like how it's an actual copy cat and not just a pupil because it makes it way more interesting even tho the twists in saw was the best part.
Jigsaw must be a huge sega dreamcast fan.
It's like covid doesn't exist when these movie nuts shoot a video. They attack me for walking in a store without a mask but it's fine for hellywood to shoot a video. Niiicee.
Wow, I was so excited about this, but the voice mod/actor for "Jigsaw" sounds HOOOORRRIIBLE to me. If you replace him, you need to have someone who sounds really good. To me it sounds like a Youtuber making a horror movie who doesn't know how to use Premiere.   Hopefully the movie is good enough to get me over that, but it sounds pretty bad to me unfortunately.
No billy puppet or classic Jigsaw voice? Maaann come on
The pig cop marionette is a veeeeery cool touch
Dude what if Daniel matthews was the one behind all this???!!! Think about it saw 2 ending Daniel was found alive and after all these years what if it was Daniel who could be the new jigsaw killer?? Or dr Gordon’s daughter Diana Gordon (played by McKenzie vega who is now 27 years old) would be a excellent surprise cameo to find out near the end it was one of the two characters!! Just my theory
Some trap speculation 0:40 Looks like he has something clamped around either his tongue or his jaw. My guess is he has to jump down and rip something out of his mouth to escape. Also note the tv on the tracks.  2:05 Classic chained to a pipe with a hacksaw  2:07 Not enough shown to really tell anything. Although I'm willing to guess this actually is part of someone else's trap. They have to try to save that guy from being machine gunned.  2:22 Looks like some sort of Marionette trap. Based on the lighting and location it might be related to the guy getting machine gunned. Also worth noting one of the posters has a line that says "Who's pulling the strings?" It looks like he'll be making things happen to other people below him.  In the first trailer we saw the aftermath of the train trap. We saw another one with someone getting their fingers pulled off. So that's what we know so far.
Looks Promising!
Corny  lol
The guy at 1:14 and the tape at the end say the same thing, so i'm assuming he's the killer.
All I can think of is Marty from Madagascar speaking
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
i can’t see marty from madagascar playing serious
I can't take his voice serious. All i hear is the zebra from Madagascar.
also known as black saw
2:21 I would not do this if I had Samuel Jackson Networth
I can't wait for this!!!! My reaction: https://youtu.be/QBwF4gQdsF8
I am legitimately interested in seeing this movie.
Chris Rock should have bought some GME shares instead of agreeing to star in this crap.
This pre-trailer stuff is getting on my nerves!  ( They need to make a seperate ad trailer for Youtube)
Samuel L Jackson and Chris Rock!? I'm in!😁 Not sure about theaters tho...
The Script A Mafia Story! The Novel That Is a movie for the Mind...
I wonder if it's the wife
Maybe dr gordons daughter is the new jigsaw killer
Sam Jackson is a teenage father in this movie because he's only 16 yrs older than Chris
2:22 gonna assume that trap just rips apart limbs or twists them
2:07 look someone’s walking away from him looks like his arm is chained up he didn’t cut his arm off he lost the game the killer came to confront him say game over or something and leave him there to die
Bro the new traps are BUSSIN!!!!

Is that the balloon boy laugh from FNAF 2? Lol
No billy the puppet gay asf 😕
Saw movies were great. I have high hopes for Spiral🤞
Damn bro donkeys police career appears to be going well.
Sorry cant't take chris seriously in this with his goofy ass voice.
Looking forward to watching this when it comes out
Everybody loves Chris.
21 savage at 1:22
i'm genuinely excited to see this. i'm surprised.
i cant take chris rock seriously. the whole time i would just be waiting for him to say "wachu want a cookie?"
Can't wait!!!!!! Yeeeeaaaahhhh!!!!🤩🤩👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Sega Dreamcast is killing people?
Happy that Chris Rock is doing more serious movies, he's a really talented actor. Wish him the best of luck here! 😁👍
Now I’m going to see this
Call me crazy but this beat reminds me of Billy’s laugh listen 1:48
Anyone else think the ignorant rap song already ruined this movie?
Why is Jigsaw's voice not the same like in the previous jigsaw movies?🙄
If they don't pull off the same twist for the 9th time I'ma be pissed. That's why I love this series.
Saw: black pandering edition
I literally typed into YouTube 'new saw movie' just to see if anything would show up! I had no idea a new trailer dropped today.
There was something off about this trailer. Like the audio was badly edited. Was I the only one who thought that?
John Kramer knew his legacy would live on.   It’s like his gospel.
It's really difficult to take Chris Rock seriously when he uses his loud angry voice which has been so iconic for him as a comedian.
Junji Ito taught me to fear the spiral and holes shape liked me.
Producers: How many saw movies do you want? 21 Savage: ALOT
2:16 they picked a voice that sounds in a way kind but also so robotic and creepy
Affirmative Action.
That voice on the recording sounds so stupid
1:01 LELA STAR 😍😋

Thanks for ruining the movie!
This whole thing is on some Saturday Night Live shit. It don’t feel right at all
They got a different pig and everything 😳
I'm sorry, but I can't help but hear Marty from Madagascar.
I wanna play a game....
I feel like this showed me more than I wanted to know going in, but what I saw captured my interest at least.
I’m sorry but I cannot take Chris Rock’s Vice serious in serious movies...
Of course his dad from Chicago  More of capitalism taking advantage of the poverty and gang violence from the inner city...
When you are casting a horror movie you best come correct. Oh Yeah, they comin' Jesus,  they comin'
Plot Twist: its Rock the whole time...
Trailer looked good but not a fan of the new jigsaw voice
Please for the love of fuc**ng God stop the idiotic pre-trailer BULL! STOP no one likes it. When are studios going to understand it looks sh*t!!?!
I love the saw series so much. Really hoping this is another great one!
I can’t wait 😜
Doesn’t really look that good  . But hey who knows it might be .
I thought this was a comedy
Hello Angry Grandpa..
Seems like... the same old shit. Come on Hollywood 😒
I really hop Chris Rock does well! It’s always hard for top tier comedians to gain respect from the audience in serious roles, which is unfair to comedians. Personally I always try to separate the career from the actor when I watch somebody in a role where I know that’s not their main thing or they’re more known for something else...but others don’t think that way. I think he can pull it off though I guess we’ll just have to see.
Why are they revamping this franchise again? Let it go please
This looks like its gonna be good! Can't wait to watch
Low key hoping at the end of the movie the Spiral Killer gets caught by Logan or Gordon and is put in a trap and killed for trying to be a bootleg jigsaw.
1:55
Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson  Marty and Fury *_Heck Y e a h_*
The only thing I’m not liking is that Billy the puppet isn’t in this one😢
I can’t take Chris serious😂
Let’s just hope that this one is going to be better than the last few
I'm looking forward to this
Looks really good, this was #3 of my anticipated horror films of last year. My #1 would be Antlers and #2 is Candyman.
that one girl looked like lela star
A movie that looks intriguing without wokeness being shoved into our faces
Amazing
liongate is beyond desperate having chris rock a racist / h8ter in there straight back to hvs 📼 😴🙄👎🏼
wake me up when its May 14.
I lowkey thought they we're about to use "Welcome to the Black Parade" at the beginning of this trailer.
Yea sorry I just cant with chris rock in a serious role. Doesnt work for me
Ah yes Hollywood, just what we need right now. More violence and bloodshed. Bunch of hypocrites.
I really hope this succeeds. This looks great.
They kill Sam Jackon we riot in the streets
I'm game, looks like fun 😁
Please don't let Samuel L Jackson die! Please don't let Samuel L Jackson die!  Please don't let Samuel L Jackson die!  Please DONT !
I'm glad twisted pictures are still making  the movie
no thanks.. they need to let this series end.
Jigsaw screwed me over, Chris rock plsssss save it
The song playing is absolute trash, but the trailer is thankfully better than the first one
Plot twist:His father was the bad guy this whole time
The killers in this film have another motive than just killing.
This is the shittiest trailer I've seen in a while. Poor editing, terrible audio and no coherence at all.  A real letdown after the awesome teaser trailer.
A Full 7 days before my birthday!
Who gives a fuck man ? Why can’t we just continue with Saw 8 and have Hoffman and Gordon return....but who knows ...
I cannot wait for this! The moment I found out Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson was like yessss. Then finding out Chris Rock is a fan of Saw it made my whole day. This is going to be good.
Tyler Perry’s Saw
I’m tryna hear 👂🏽that song 🎧 tho
A dramatic SAW film that isn't over the top and just gore porn? This can't be real
Mmm...looks interesting. Alright, Chris let's see what you got!
Chris Rock makes acting look really difficult,  and this is a reminder to me that not every legendary comedian can be a good dramatic actor, but good on him for challenging himself and taking risks this late in his career.
Yes!!!!!!!!
Idk if it’s just me, but I can’t handle my man Chris Rock doing horror movie cus of all his standups lol.
Omg this looks fucking brilliant
😂😂
A porca do DBD
this actually looks fucking awesome I’m so pumped rn
This trailer just made me miss my sega dreamcast :(
Now gives me a sane reason to watch the films again so I don't look crazy for watching them for the enjoyment...
only watching this for the 21 savage
Chris rock channeling his inner pookie ha ha
Chris rock getting these serious roles he's been asking for.
Looks like good acting from Chris!👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
I only want to see this for the following reasons: 1. The 2 leads 2. The soundtrack 3. It will either be really good or awful 4. I don't need to see the others (cause I don't want too)
Looks like they are tying Pighead (Jigsaw and his acolytes' disguise) to the insult of cops being "pigs," as the new puppet is a pig wearing a policeman uniform with spirals in his eyes.   Wouldn't be surprised if either the new killer is a cop himself or someone whose loved one was killed by a police officer (which is seeming to play off the current political climate involving police and civilians today in the real world).
Sam Jackson probably going to be the twist killer
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you still can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
I see influences from  "Seven" 90s movie with Brad Pitt
Oh *sugar honey ice tea!*
looks good. not too cheesey like the previous sequels.
I wish they would go back to showing an entire trap prior to the release to hype up the film.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16
1:20 21 Savage 🔥😂
Chris Rock has done so much comedy,  it's going to be weird seeing him playa serious character
Hoffman or Gordon or Daniel or the girl from jigsaw elenor
Pookie can't be taken seriously.
Please don’t kill Uncle Sam. We all need Uncle Sam. Please Jigsaw. Don’t do it. Take me. Take meeeeee.
Let’s watch a trailer that may just spoil some important scenes. SMH.
Is it me or is it odd seeing Chris Rock playing a main role in a scary movie? You're a comedian.
I can’t take Chris Rock seriously 😂
Chris Rock in a horror movie???
Looks good but the voice is kinda of weird and sounds like a 911 dispatcher lol
everytime Chris Rock Shouts or Yell, i can't help imagine Marty from Madagascar, on the side note I'm going to watch this movie, looks interesting.
Oh Shit!
Dead Meat fans, eat ur hearts out
This is going to be awesome!
Excited to see chris rock do a dramatic role
Monokuma: Let's give it all we got. 😈
1:13 & 2:17 🌀
Ayo it’s that zebra from Madagascar
Oh yeah, that's the one for me. I cant wait
Well of course I'm going open day to see it. I've already sunk way too much time and energy into the Saw universe.   🪚🪚🪚🪚🪚🪚🪚🪚🪚    9th Saw
Watch the new saw will be Tiffany hadish ..... Fucking cultural appropriation....
Some of the cast just dose not do it for me
I’m always here for more Saw 👌👌
As a Sam Jackson/ Chris Rock fan Im watching it even if its trash. Sam is a little young to be Chris' pop though
I'm Looking Forward To This New Saw Movie , Hope Chris Rock And Samuel L Jackson Make This Movie Lit🔥🔥🔥🤟🏽👍🏽🤘🏽💯🤞🏽🙏🏽✊🏽😎🤔🧐
I don't know why but I can't take Chris Rock Serious... he sounds like he's doing a stand up
is this supposed to be a horror movie because it looks like cops are the only victims here
Jurassic/Jack Ryan/Die Hard/Shaft/xXx/Robocop/QT/Star Wars/MCU  and now SAW        SLJ = Franchise King
{R rated}    no shit
i think chris used the same tone for every goddam line. Im passing.
It’s gonna be trash.
You can check out my covers if you want to! It would mean a lot to me❤️😊
I can’t take Chris Rock seriously! After every death the whole theater is gonna yell “Everybody Hates Chris!”
Is samue l Jackson the one behind everything?
Samuel L Jackson is the new jigsaw just watch.
ill never get tired of saw movies, im for it
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos♦️
Dreamcast is back baby!!!!!!!
Why does jigsaw sound like a 12 year old pre pubescent boy now
Really bad Trailer. Chris Rock can't act.
Is this horror-comedy? or am I just convinced Chris' voice is always funny
I said this in the last trailer, I think the killer is Hoffman. Imagine if they did that, think about it. Yes we saw Dr Gordon chain him up in the bathroom but we never saw him die. And the killer is targeting cops, Hoffman was a cop. If they do that I’m sold!!!🔥
I’m so excited for this. SAW is back!!!!🔥🔥
I love how it shows the traps without showing how it works or how to escape it
cheap jumpscares incoming LOL
OMG :D
Один из немногих официальных трейлеров почти в 4К 😄. 1080р на ютуб уже невозможно смотреть
2:02 Tobin Bell?
0:38 How're ya now?
Okay wait a second. Did they just use the fucking Bonzie Buddy voice for the tapes?
The pig is wearing a cop suit...
ODM GEAR TRAP AOT 2:21
liking this. looks way better than the Saw remake using cgi instead of the practical effects and props for realism. Hope they stick to their roots in this one but of course being a sequel with a new character playing  "Jigsaw"
I can't wait to watch this. SAW is my favorite horror movie franchise and I wanna see where this goes
This trailer is awesome! Salute to Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson. Excited, to watch this! 💪🏿🔥🔥
I hope they dont just completely forget about the previous antagonist?
Good to see Chris Rock in movies again. This looks good.
I swear if the guy at 1:13 ends up being the killer im gonna be upset with this trailer, just cause of what he say's to much spoilers 😤
Hindi please
YESSS Lions Gate Heard My Cry Thank You Lionsgate
This better come "Mothaf0cka drinking game" friendly...
this is def something i’m gonna see for sure ...it looks great
Why so comedians are so dope when giving a non comedy role?
and in the sequel we will learn everyone was working for Jigsaw all along!
I’ll still enjoy it but anyone else gonna laugh just a tiny bit because Christ rock and Sam L Jackson are in it? 😂
I couldn't hear, what was the voice saying when was Samuel L Jackson on a trap?
the first film is one of my favourite horror movies ever, all of the sequels after it have been pretty bad (if you like them that's cool, it's just my opinion), and this new one looks pretty good in all honesty. i'm excited :)
Cannot wait to see this! Charlie Clouser will deliver his amazing score again that's for sure!
The saw is SEGA DREAMCAST
It's gonna be the female cop, isn't it?
why so fucking yellow?????
this is one cheap looking and cheap sounding trailer. trying so hard lol
I hope we finally get closure for Hoffman. No way he just died in the bathroom.
This is so real!
Chris Rock??
Why is jigsaw look Weird
1:13 2:15 hmmmmmmmmmmmm
I'll be honest, I was burned a bit by "Saw 3D" and severly burned by "Jigsaw"... So I was a bit skeptical about this one. This however has restored most of my trust in the series and looks like the right direction for this series. It seems to be more in line of what I hoped "Jigsaw" would be, a copycat killer, not a convultated other apprentice "we just didn't know of". Hopefully, the traps in this one don't require omniscience like in "Jigsaw" and the film has an overall better story than "Saw 3D". But this makes me hopefull, not everything looks perfect or like I would have wanted it but it looks still interesting.
Huge saw fan they need to fix that tape voice tho its iconic like amanda ... Tobin...hoffman im dying for this movie but i dont dig that voice even logans voice
Fin del juego
Wonder which black guy dies first?

allot of one liners for Chris...
My man Darren Lynn Bousman is back!!
This looks so good!! So excited
Holy molly, that trailer looks very amazing, i waiting to see the movie in cinemas, See You in 14 May everyone.   Great work Lionsgate
Chris Rock: Jigsaw be shoppin!!!
What if samuel l jackson character is jigsaws childhood friend lol
I never imagined Chris Rock playing a serious cop, but could be good to extend his portfolio.  The fact that Samuel L Jackson is in the film, surprises me, but makes it all that more appealing!!
Billy is retired? well hope the new kid brings it just as good as he did
is that jake peralta's ex girlfriend from b99????
Sawseiro do cacete!
Please release in indian languages telugu Tamil
Omg
Damn... Tiffany Co. already prepping their lawsuit for using their blue on the box.
I can't wait to see this!
Only thing I don’t like is the Jigsaw voice. Not as good as original guy.
Looks worse than expected.
Wow. This looks incredible
And if you go watch the movie this time you can actually die!
Im gonna guess and say Mr. Jackson is the killer. And the last clip we see is him in a trap, getting out, and turning into the copycat. Because I have a feeling he knows more about the Jigsaw murders than the trailer indicates.
1:13 - "When was the last time you Saw your father"
At 1:14/1:15- Guy asks "What's the last time you saw your father?"  At 2:18- Killer's voice asking "What's the last time you saw your father?"   This guy is the killer.
What is that voice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ayyy it’s Nick from A Handmaids Tale, Donkey from Shrek, and Mace Windu from Star Wars! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
i can’t take chris rock as a serious actor, like at all.
In 2:00 there is a picture of John Kramer and Billy the Puppet, that convinced me this movie is happening in the same universe and is going to be good. And again later on the "pig mask on tv" is a thing John never did and would never do, which hints that our new killer has no ties with John Kramer and is a real copycat, not an apprentice like Logan Nelson in Jigsaw.
This looks insane, definitely going to watch it
welp time to rewatch all of the saw movies
Chris Rock being serious is something I didn't expected :D
HOLY SHIT! It's really happening! So hyped!!! 😁😁😁
That CZsWorld guy is gonna have a field day with this one
Omg this better actually be good if they put Sam Jackson and Chris Rock in a flop I’m going to be so mad lmao
Hello Zepp???
Hopefully they don't make 347 more trailers showing the whole movie. 🤦‍♂️
Why is nobody talking about the badass spiral song on this trailer? What is this song?
Where is the puppet? We need the puppet.
I want to see Gordon and Logan(+Eleanor) again...or at least the mention of them
I ll ignore it.. too many Ns.
That's an easy case to solve. Find any officer who got screwed over by the force (like in Speed) or anyone who had a friend/family that was shot/treated wrongly by an officer.
А следующей франшизой оживите пожалуйста ещё и Пункт Назначения =*
oh my god it's a             dreamcast
Looks great
Wait a trailer uploaded with a quality higher than 1080p, IMPOSSIBLE.
Song name please?
Nick Fury has a son!  Spider-Man and SAW crossover confirmed!!!........  😅
Saw 9...🔥🔥🔥
THIS LOOKS AWESOME
Looks good but why would you not put the Saw music in the trailer?

2:14 is i the only one that thinks that kinda sound like bonzi buddy
I gotta say i had my doubts about Chris rock but now I'm sold really looking forward to it
Bet its John Kramers daughter
Yes! This is the New Saw not Jigsaw sorry, awesome trailer and the final trap in the trailer, looks brutal poor Samuel xD
You have my curiosity 🙂
I dunno man, they lost me once the Spiral rap song came in lol. And I just can't see Chris Rock outside of comedy.
It gives me goosebumps 😍
why don't you bring Eddie murphy too if your bringing comedians on horror movies
I would like to see Jean Claude Van Damme as jigsaw I'm sure with his voice would be darker than john kramer's anyone agree
I NEED IT!!
Jigsaw: "Let the game begin" Tonya: "Momy, Chris lost the hands" Rochelle: "Take the robitussin"
I really hoped there was a Tobin Bell voice changer, also I hope Logan, or Lawrence shows up again and not yet another successor.
Looks really cool  I wish we could hear the iconic jigsaw voice  on the tapes this one sounds strange but we get a picture of John Kramer,  oh I hope Tobin Bell will have a small cameo in a flashback or something  #spiral #saw #jigsaw
Best Jigsaw scene ever: "I know how much you don't like smelly smells.   I know how much you think it's disgusting, beetles and bugs.  You wouldn't touch them when you were a child...  Now you must.   Because if you cannot be in this room for more than one minute,   {Gas}   will start flowing  Only after you puke though, I gotta make that really clear  I've been talking for a while  Only after you puke into that toilet  {Gas}  will fill the room.  Make your choice.  Will you stand the smelly smells for 10 minutes?  Or will you puke into the toilet, filling the room with   {Gas}  Make your choice"  RIP Michael ya never stood a chance
This looks good! This looks really really good!!
HOLY SHIT IVE BEEN WAITING AGES
🖤🖤🖤
Seeing Chris Rock in a serious movie, funnier??
Lol I’m having a hard time taking Chris Rock seriously
2:05 a nod to the original scene from Saw 2004
This look sick!!!!! Can't wait !
Looks promising
I miss Billy
#RestoretheSnyderverse
😍😍😍😍😍
Jigsaw ended off on a cliffhanger, I think this will tie in to that movie somehow and the killer from Jigsaw will make a cameo here.
please stop the mini trailers. have some faith in our attention span
I appreciate the focus on mystery and secret plots from the shadows, SAW was always at its best when it was about that, rather than solely the traps.
HE'S EVERYWHERE  HE'S EVERYONE HE'S JIGSAW HE'S         The spiral
This looks awsome I hope it retarts the franchise unlike jigsaw
Hell yeah!!!
It’s his dad
Alright, can we just appreciate how good this actually looks, and how much effort Chris Rock put into creating this project?
The villain is the woman cop.
wow, hell
OMG YES DUDE YES I can't stop watching this
Finally i waitting the new trailer
been looking forward to this!!!
as a saw fan im soo excited to see this movie it looks really good
Cant wait!
The voice of this new jigsaw copycat looks the translate voice, weak.
WHAT'S IN THE BOX!!!!  WHAT'S IN THE BOX!!!!! NO!!!  NO!!!!  NO!!!!!
Interesting
I'm excited to watch it in the theater but I bet Samuel L. Jackson will be the new killer, and the main lesson will be something about how in nowadays people don't care about family and friends.  Btw, I don't like the new Jiggsaw's voice.
Everyone: Can't wait to watch this   Me: I can't wait for Dead Meat to cover this one
damn, he's so funny
Imagine if Hoffman never died in Saw 3D and hes back with an entirely new plan, persona, and motive. Could be why the new killer is mocking jigsaw as well🤷‍♂️
Didn't Boris say cinemas don't open until 17th May at the earliest?
good Trailer will watch again

NICE!! I just missed the original SAW theme song in this one. And the scene I'm most looking forward to watch is the scene where the detectives are analyzing the photos on the panel. There must be a LOT of the old movies there. And I loved that John/Billy pictures!
Is is weird that I miss Jigsaw's Billy puppet, because that new marionette is FREAKY AS HELL
It's good to see a diverse cast for once, but I still see no transgenders...
After years  Finally!

Boy look at that... Right now waiting is not my strongest Suit.... ❤️❤️
it gonna hurt seen chris rock and samuel l. jackson die in this
Is that the Bathroom at 1:52?
Brooooo the new puppet is so AMAZING
I miss Billy the Puppet :/
yawn
Looks fire but it revealed way too much. Now I know that Sam Jackson is gonna end up getting tortured and Chris Rock prolly has to saw his arm off.
STOOOOP!!!!
Where is Billy the puppet😤
I'm going to watch this of course...but I cannot take Chris Rock seriously. It's his voice, you hear it and just start laughing.
This looks like it’s gonna make up for the last 5. Except Jigsaw, I liked that one.
2:00 John Kramer and Billy the puppet  The new Jigsaw killer is definitely inspired from John Kramer Maybe the new killer is Hoffman or Logan

I feel like I have been seeing this new trailer for several years now.
This looks so good... My biggest "movie blue balls" ever, I've been dying from anticipation since last year
*I want to play a game.*
One of my most anticipated movies of the year!! Looks incredible :)
Looks great a new jigsaw killer a new doll,  and in the same universe, ı hope this will have sequels like original saw movies.
Growing up on SAW idk about this one. How can ya show an image of Tobin Bell but not use his voice for the audio? It’s not the same anymore. 😩 Logan at least used recordings of Tobin and put them together just like Hoffman. Come on now.
Is this like, Racist Saw or smth?
i'm feeling the first Saw vibes not gonna lie, really hyped for this
Can't wait! Has the vibes from the first 3 Saw films. Fresh new take on it. Yesssssss
This looks hideous, like a discounted Saw spin-off. Nothing will encapsulate the vibe of the original Saw franchise.
The only movie from "SAW" I saw was jigsaw. I seen Deadmeat videos soo I'm pretty much catch up. The movie looks good like Jigsaw
I hope they change the voice on the recording to the jigsaw voice! This one just sounds silly.
I usually can’t do movies like SAW because watching them takes years off of my life, but I’m sold on this if it has Chris rock and Samuel L. Jackson
BLM?
2:00 - The real hero is here that we all lookin for
...leave the #saw alone, it hurts to watch how squirm over the project.
Can’t wait to see this new chapter ! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Why does his voice still sound funny lol
lets go i can't wait for this film going to be an awsome film
looks damn good! wish the trailer had kept some of the traps hidden...wouldve made the surprise better.
Nick Fury(Avengers) and Marty Zebra(Madagascar)
Are we finally getting the Saw sequel the series deserves?
Hopefully better than that fake wrong turn
Chris Rock & Samuel L. Jackson have to each escape a Jigsaw deathtrap in  Spiral: From The Book Of Saw!
Mark my words, I'm almost 100% sure that the lady who says "You can't do this alone" either is the killer or she's involved in the murders.
Name of the song???????
Let's. Get. TO THE NUMBERS!!
I can’t wait to listen to the new 21 savage song
Its obviously a woman on the tape.. So the only woman on the trailer must be it. Unless she's being manipulated by someone else.
Looks interesting! I'll give it a shot. Recently binge-watched all Saw movies again
I feel like the twist could be that whichever Jigsaw made this murder thing the least likely to link back to him and made them think there’s a whole other killer,
Can't wait for this! Didn't really like that Spiral song though lol
Chris Rock has done so much comedy,  it's going to be weird seeing him play a serious character
Samuel L Jackson.. Do some read it.. I'm waiting
So this guy at 1:15 says “when was the last time you SAW your father” at the end you hear “jigsaw” say “when was the last time you SAW your father” at least that’s what it sounded like to me. My personal prediction and opinion is that the guy at the 1:15 mark is jigsaw. You also see him a lot in the background of the trailer if you pause at the right moments
Chris Rock is clearly not meant for serious roles, because even as he raises his voice in this trailer with that tone, all I see and hear is everyone’s favorite funny comedian.
That new puppet look strangely creepy also his laugh,ain’t gonna mess with that doll...
the puppet in the tv unfortunately gives me Jigsaw flashbacks but thats the only negative thing about this whole trailer
Im scared, im not gonna like it... Nothing will be as good as first few Saw movies... Love first 7 movies and story behind it... Dont like Jigsaw and im afraid i will hate this... just leave Saw alone and dont make just another trash movies using Saw name...
Awesome 👏
HERMIONE LODGE DID NOT LEAVE RIVERDALE TO BE KILLED BY JIGSAW
Actually excited for this one
What the fuck is the discusting voice at the end ??? 😭😭
oh yes baby
Waiting for this movie.
To me this looks leagues above JigSaw imo I feel jigsaw was uninspired and completely basic traps this at first glance looks amazing but don’t get me wrong JigSaw is a ok watch
Can't wait to see this, looks promising. Can't wait to SPIRAL. 🌀
"motherfucker"- Samuel L Jackson
Liongate, please add subtitles on your trailers, please.
Even though it should have stopped at 3 I’m still interested in watching this
Wow, there is that one guy from Horns!
This looks awesome
Yesssssssssssssssssssss🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍
Damn, you got me!
Now this is an actual movie that everyone have forgotten about during the quarantine.
1:06 I thought she was Noomi Rapas
Well then
Holy crap, this already looks good, best cinematography of the franchise so far, I love how it looks nothing related from the first ones but still having the old elements, full like-Seven investigation going on yet got that interesting vicious traps! Gonna watch it the first second it drops!
John Kramer will live Forever. We Honor the new Jigsaw ✋💀
I am *SO READY*
SAWの大ファンで新予告編をずっと待ってました。 楽しみすぎる。アスミックエース日本公開の情報早くしてくれ。
MOVIE THEATRES ARE BACK BABY
Ho-lee-fuck. This looks like it’s going to breathe new life in the series.
I'm missing saw theme here.. Badly!!
This movie goes to 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This certainly looks like an improvement from the previous films. A new look and feel and definitively a more close appeal to the first 3 films of the franchise. COUNT ME IN
2:04 That's me!!!!! GAHHH!!!!
We've all been waiting for this trailer
1:06 is she Lela Star
Was waiting for the "do you wanna play a game" 🥰🥰🥰🥰 great trialeR CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. SAW IS BACK

Sounds like it’s going to be the female cop as the killer
Ohhh my GOD! 💘
The same day on my birthday
No one *S A W* this coming
Trash
❤❤❤awesome❤❤❤👍👍👍
If Samuel L Jackson doesn't say "motherfucker" atleast once in the movie, I'll be upset by it 😂
О даа, мурашки пошли по коже. Надеюсь фильм будет крут. Крис в этой роли отпад
Oh it's so great. Big fan of the franchise. And now another one in a few weeks. Any plans how we can watch it in germany our cinemas are close due to the pandemic;(
to bude psycho
Lessgoo
That voice is dumb as hell but the film looks incredible
This feels like Saw, but cranked up to 100.
Looking foward to this and how it plays into the SAW universe. Great hob to Chris Rock, Darren Lynn Bousman, Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger for keeping the SAW/JIGSAW movies alive even in 2021, Can't wait for it!!!!
who new puppet
I'm really waiting for this
I was not particularly a fan of this series. Until now.
We need this trailer.
Não da dá pra leva  a sério
When Chris Rock stepped out of comedy and try to do serious roles, he really shines. I hope that this would be a good Saw movie
Very excited to watch this movie
love this so much!!!
