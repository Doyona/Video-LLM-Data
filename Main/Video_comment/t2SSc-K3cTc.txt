gaming but make it ✨ educational ✨
0:16 That one didnt age so well 😬
Are you an engineer
If you go into the water menu and click a water dispenser it shows flow of water with arrows.. much better for observing.
the shape tho
Oh, you’re gay
Not really a Tesla valve but your solution does look "veiny" so I think it gets a pass!
Real civil engineer be like kiss my as$
WHY THE HECK IS THERE A PAIR OF NUTS!?
"I heard a concept but I dont know what I am doing" type of video.
Maybe a reservoir tip?
5:27 ayo!!!!
Good video and all... but i can see here in the comments that I'm not the only engineer feeling yanked by there being no tesla valve presented.  This looks more like the cross section of a firearm supressor.
Anyone still here 2025
‘Such a child’ famous last words 😂
as a physics student, this is the only fluid dynamics eduction that hasn't made me want to jump out a window
What interesting shape 5:27
Hi
Instead of building many km of fancy valves would be far easier to close the gap 18:36 in that wall with far smaller amount of material.
Saying your making the strongest shape as an excuse to make THAT is insane.
An idea is to add a hydro electric generator on the intake to power a booster in the return direction to further make the forces of evil destroy each other. ☯️
Falsch gebaut ☺️ sorry
The design😂😂
6:37 I look back at my screen after a moment and just see the absolute PEAK tsunami funnel
am I the only one hearing him say electhrizipy? At 0:03
fun fact, there is no such thing as "water physics" in video games. water is just a solid terrain object with some lighting effects. it would be so cool if you cold actually make a game with proper fluid simulation, but were probably  15-20 years away from that being available on a gaming pc.
also design flaw: the tesal valve would only work with continuous flow of water, but the tsunami is a burst of water. therefore this design is not  though for this
5:25 im I the only one that noticed that?! 😂
5:30 What's thatttttttttttttttttttttttt
Education or tesla cars???
that is not even a tesla valve and tesla valve is not meant to stop the initial flow
5:30 pause
That is not at all like a tesla valve.
That's not a tesla valve
5:22 Uhm...
Curious why you choose to create the valve symmetrically when Tesla's design has offset channels. It would be nice if you demonstrated that more true to form.
Was this made on April 1st....lol
Based on the schematics, the valves should be uneven
I can deal with the puerile humour, but I am disappointed that you give such little importance to accuracy. 3 out of 10, and I am being generous. I hope I don't inadvertently end up seeing too many more of your videos.
perv
Woah! I bet this title really triggered some weak minded individuals.
The water dynamics doesn't take into account bulk up into narrowing's.  Fun, but not educational.
5:24 did you mean for it to look like genitalia?
Tesla didn’t invent electricity, he discovered it.
You could've just added an enlarged prostate then it would've dribbled into the city
i love the authentic traffic behavior in a  rush hr crisis is spot on where i live.
my head hurt as soon as you said "inventor of electricity" x.x
What a novel way to get a dick on YouTube 🤣😂🤩
is engineer proceeds to NOT build a Tesla valve
Oh youtube, I wonder why those algorithms decided to recommend this one today of all days...
creator of toribash Valve at the beggining
Wow a gentleman’s finger valve
7:40 😂 a complete full functional pp
This just doesn't make sense at all.
I feel that cities Skylines is calculating amplitude and keeping the spread of a constant speed while diminishing the amplitude only
Flow only speeds up in a tube not a trough.
.....bracing piers?
... no
for this to work u need to keep that much space empty...but in real world we r expanding into sea... if enough space is left then mangroves can save cities for free...  but it seems impossible so u need to provide solution considering that much space can't be left...
Not a Tesla valve. Lame
you diabolical POS you designed a weiner that can't bust 🤣
“were gonna add these structural supports…yeah that looks good” *literally just a dong*
You should try this experiement with a tesla valve.
That is not a tesla valve I'm pretty sure
Well done Tesla!
Blue balling but engineering.
Its the yellow liquid coming out 7:02 😂
could you do this in city skylines 2 to see how diffrent it is?
Any excuse to act like a 10yo on YouTube and draw a YUGE willy!
5:24 the hair on the balls was a nice touch
Gayest video I've seen in some time.
That's not a Tesla valve. It's just a pulse buffer. Tesla valves have cross-path diversion.
Corpus cavernosum simulation
This looks EXACTLY like a cross-section of a gun suppressor. Instead of water, it uses a stack of baffles like that to slow down and trap the expanding gases from the bullet.
You forgot the offset. That is important
the tesla channel is designed to split the water into two rivers, and head-on smash one river straight into the other. it's like clapping hands. what you designed is more like a gun barrel that silences the bang, similar concept
5:24 when i saw that structure. I noticed my mind is beyond saving
Oooooh it's a recursive effect that uses pressure to reflect the water back unto its own flow, kind of like a straw shooting water into itself and stopping its own flow. Yeah, Tesla was a genius.
How can I down vote this enough so that I never have to see a video as bad as this ever again...
my arse was like what a terrible gusset for the entrance... 3d Chess my friend... 3d chess....
That's not a Tesla valve.
That's a really interesting draft of a proof of concept for, at least, flood control in costal cities with major rivers  that cut throug then.
an anti-ejaculation cosmetic surgery
Next time make a Tesla valve when you're going to test a tesla valve...  Just like most engineer's they are nothing without the designers to slap them upside the head to get them to MAKE the thing they are supposed to be making.
Riiiiiiight, bracing pairs... ROFLMAO.
Please do this again, but alternatingly eliminating half the valve walls, then adjust their angle so they overlap as you look at the city from the sea i.e. you shouldn’t be able to see the city.   TLDR: make it a Tesla valve, not a baffle
Your setup looks very... rigid. Well played.
Tesla Valve? Naah, It's just a HUGE water supperssor :)
They look like… baffles… for a suppressor.
This is not how the Tesla valve is supposed to work. Tesla valve does not have straight passage thru the center.
Turn it into a suppresser for a gun
Ackchually, that’s not a Tesla valve.
Very cool educational video. Thanks for posting this.
Tesla's modern reputation is so weird. He did a few real engineering things. But the guy was a crackpot.   No one: Tesla: I made a death ray, it goes to another school, in Canada
I've become the stereotype watching this at midnight instead of sleeping xD
The Bernoulli principles you're on about apply to closed pipes, applying them to an open system like this is way more complex.   Apart from anything else, the wave can and will get higher in the narrow part of the channel, which is another way of storing energy that the fluid in the pipe does not have. Thinking of things in 2D, it effectively makes it compressible.  Also, a tsunami wave is very different from a consistently flowing fluid in a closed pipe. To be simplistic, there is nothing behind the wave pushing it forwards, nor is there anything in front of it pulling it on, as there is with a fluid flowing in a pipe. The only thing that keeps it going is its momentum. A tsunami near shore behaves as q breaking wave, in other words a mass of water that continues on just because nothing has stopped it yet. You would be better thinking of it as a mass of bowling balls than as a fluid in a pipe.
Should be rated X video
17:00 why do you think the wave would move slower down one path than the other? Im not an engineer but i can't see why it would change speed
This may be the most elaborate dick joke ive ever seen
More discount on the British sugar😊
Considering that a real tesla valve is actually a one way valve in surprised you didn't put the valve on the river.
Can we get accurate physics in Cities: Skylines? This would be useful to answer such questions for real life by simulating it in the city builder sim.
You're a Richard
A dick of simulation...
thats not even made right
9:50 nice interference pattern in the wave fronts
Why is this video still named Tesla valve?
Did you do ANY research on what a Tesla valve actually looks like or how it works? This is one of those videos I just shake my head at the stupidity.
5:25 I think I might be dirty minded
you should redo this test in Cities Skylines 2 to see if they have improved the water pshyics at all between versions
video could have been 4minz
Hydrolic speed is building up in a closed system only...
I think the thing this game *really* simulates effectively is "what if humans had no self-preservation instinct?"
Math can solve this. Find the volume of the value areas total, then the volume of the tsunami wave.. if yes, then the potential is a yes. The only problem may be the center, but physics can predict that.  You don't have to run physical experiments, you can just calculate.
jesus, I guess this proves that Ds get degrees since you fully fucked up most of the core engineering principles for the valve whose proper design you even showed off.  The lack of sharp angles and OFFSET of the  diversion channels was a key and crucial part of the design. You just made something that would cause unbelievable turbulence inside the valve mechanism and cause the inner walls to break off and damage the line constantly.  if this is a real civil engineer, it certainly puts the sorry state of most western capitalist cities into perspective.  could never be Shenzhen
I think overlapping the last lines by alternating their angles of them could help even more? (I have 0 experience in this)
pls dont talk, thanks
Literally not a tesla valve.
Nicola Tesla didn’t invent electricity, he discovered it.
Bro just needed to connect the second channel to form an arrow after the first so the water would really go the other direction
That's not a Tesla valve. The geometry is way off. There is no direct line if sight though a Tesla valve.
Why do I keep watching this? What has my life become?
Make tracks for wave races
Can it be possible to steal the salt from the wave to make it lighter?
You basically made silencer baffles.
5:24  AYOOOOO MEN ONLY UNDERSTAND AND 7:40 and why 9:27
Oh cool, a neat question. 19:47 runtime.  oh no.
You didn't make a Tesla valve. You made a silencer.
Stagger them
Not sure youll see this.  Wgat about off-set the tesla valve? one coming from the left and then one fronm the right to stop the foreward motion of the water?
I love to see that everyone likes a good constructed penis
Miquella Tesla?
You need to pay more attention to your example figure. 😋
5:23 you sure this is how Tesla designed it?
So living un the bellend is not good as far as tsunamis go?
5:23 had me cracking up man. You say you are an engineer? I have seen some variation of that design drawn on the wall of every port a potty at every job site I've worked on. I guess it's something about working in the trades.😁
im a simple man, see penis joke and upvote
I just spent 20mins watching someone turn a Tesla invention into a penis in a video game....
That's not a tesla valve they cross the center line
Reoccurring themes are you building penises. Crazy.
A whole Different genre of educational video!... Kudos!!❤😂
There's no line of sight through a tesla valse. You made an inefficient pipe lol.
When you zoomed out t 13:30 you didn't seem to notice that the bottom "control" had spread out, which would slow the overall speed of the water down. You also had a picture of a Tesla valve on-screen and then made something that didn't look like it. It's an open book test and you're supposed to know this stuff, but this IS an old video so maybe ya learned something since this video?
#5:24 Been flashed by the earthes spikey testicles
NIKOLA TESLA FROM DEAD RAILS (just joking)
I dunno prolly
Or maybe  beachfront property is so expensive, stop building houses on the beach you idiots....
Fluid dynamics is clearly in the mechanical engineering domain!
yeah... that's not a tesla valve.
Glaze Elon challenge:  Level Impossible /eyeroll.  FOH with that
I think the main reason it didn't work as well as a real Tesla-Valve would, isn't because it was symmetrical. It probably was because a Valve is constructed in such a way that it blocks a continuous flow of fluids and a Tsunami is one "wall" of water. You can see it in the construction:  When the water that flows back reaches the Tsunamis main wave, it's already further ahead and isn't really affected. The Valve with a continuous water flow would start to block the water that would come afterwards.  Maybe something to consider...
DEAD RAILS
That wide open space in the middle nags me. Adding Alternating small line, tear or triangle shaped walls to further break the tsunami would be better.
As a 3d animator, water physics working slightly realistically is magic.
isnt the thing with the water velocity, that it would only highten if it was a closed system where he water cant go upwards?. so in this system where theres room, its realistic for the water not to speed up?
Wtf is that shape💀💀💀 5:24
That isn't a Tesla Valve, wtf.
How can it be both a dick and a vagina at the same time
Just like the simulations
You should make it a giant funnel, then a real Tesla value. They use them in real water projects because it curves the water back on itself. You'd only need 2 or 3 to minimize the energy.
Wouldnt it break the gulf if you put a pillar near the end of the corridor in the middle stream?  if placed right it could force the middle flow into the tesla valves.
the corners need more consistent sizing to allow the water flow to optimize
Ayo why did you make it look like that?😂😂😂😂 5:25
it looks like a🍆 7:00
Maybe take this idea to tsunami prone countries. This is cool
5:25 if yk yk
5:28 sir... sir...  I need an adult
1:08  GAMING VALVe? 🎮🕹️🚰
My immediate thought on the speed of the tsunami is that the tsunami has more in common with a shock than normal fluid flow, so the primary factor determining wave-speed should be wave height. That said, it's not like this matters either way since the simulation used a constant wave-speed for everything.
Do necklace Teslas one who made the brand that the other one who’s a little Roblox boss, which is not little and a giant
shows a diagram for a tesla value, procedes to not build one.
👍
Bro, this thing was invented to slow down water currents. This is not the concept of a dam or breakwater.
you have a leak at the Tip.
I love your channel
TSUNAM|🌊🌊🌊|
TSAA
thought this was a tesla car not an actual valve
Why can't you put a maze for the tsunami in city skylines.
Anyone know the music in this video, reminds me of ratatouille movie music but I want the genre can someone help. Great videos I love this guy
And we’d be able to watch this video for free because of him, if it weren’t for corrupt corporate magnates.
Dude uses the P.E.N.I.S. steps and then built a uterus inside it😭
14:56 I would say it worked
Isn't the Tesla Valve offset by 1 rung?
Look, the Ideas Are great but the Game/Simulation is trash
9:03 bro predicted tidal wave on gd
them structural supports are very... defined 😅
5:27 Wow… I didnt see that coming😂
What is the name of this game?
Is a non-engineer and someone who didn’t take fluid dynamics I can still confidently say you failed miserably at what you were actually trying to achieve
5:25 Got me
bruh made a dick joke
I see what you did there. Well done
Simulation starts at around 16 minutes.
i don't understand why he built it like this and not as an actual tesla valve. this is like some weird tesla valve baffle hybrid.
Hair curlers are the things you chose. How about the Altenator. No one could drive there car without him.
I’m rather disappoint in this video. You didnt actually end up making a tesla valve at all, but some weird symmetric version of it that doesn’t take into account some of its obvious design intents. The waters meant to loop and then be able to continue with the stream but with less velocity, so each successive valve isn’t actually aiming at stopping anything but only to slow its momentum.
Do you think if you put multiple tesla valves, smaller ones side by side, and further away from the coast, it will slow down and reduce gradually the amount of water that the first waves have ? Meaning that the bottom part of the waves will slow down and the water trap in the valve will leave less water to move quickly at the same time. Or put them the other way around to slow the receding of the water... I dont know if you see what I'm trying to explain lol
7:00 scientific proof that pee isn't actually stored in the balls
please do it again with a real tesla valve where the mainforce will directed backwards
The amount of things he got wrong is so insane you could make a drinking game out of it
Hahahaha.  TTP = 5:00.  Guess we can call that the tip.
I just bought the game, and wanted to know what mod is this?
5:24 😮😧🧐 That is very sus
5:25  Why is no one talking about this shape?😂 Also 7:38 ayo? I'm a bit dirty minded you know?
5:42 - 6:00 ua gave your obvious drawing a prince Albert 😂
I feel like I am stupid, but the fluid mechanics he is trying to explain should be restricted to closed systems and it should be within expectation that the speed of the water measured on both sides of the gate should not change. Like how wind blowing into a funnel does not speed up the wind.
Works great until the next tide washed it away
This doesn't work like a fluid, since on this scale it's only single wave, not a fluid. The valve to protect the city should be treated like a suppressor for a firearm rather than a fluid valve, since **ON THIS SCALE** you don't have a "fluid", you just have a single wave of energy essentially. But a tesla valve would probably make a good suppressor too, so. Kinda wrong work right answer deal going on here
5:23 "OMG that looks like a giant.....Tesla valve"
I’ve only seen two videos of yours but both contain numerous references to the penis… either you’re extremely immature or you’re just in the closet. Maybe it’s time to just be honest with yourself.
It looked like a massive male thing from the top after you deleted the roads and tracks at about 5:20
can you engineer something without a hmmm?
YouTube hi (:
The D. I love it!
Great idea!
Not only that but the tesla valve also works BETTER overall than them
Civil Engineer calling a Tsunami a Tidal Wave, hand in your degree 😂
interesting!
Prince Albert City.
YT Really wanted me to watch this video. It's been in my recommendation for weeks.  5:26 Bellend
Would be nice if you tried to actualy lewrn your homework and make the valve correctly   So water going against itslwf when going from the ocean
No offense but it is a wonder youtube hasnt cancelled you because of how many “knobs” you create
Ttp, you pulled it off
That was not tesla valve
Waves do not speed up when the passage narrows. The flow of water speeds up, the speed of waves stays the same.
I hate how important this city skylines video could become in the next decade.
_"Have I been watching the build-up to a d*ck joke this entire time"_
😂 🍆
5:27 being inapporopriate i see
Why don't you just redirect the water to the side completely once it's channeled into the main section? Also disregarding this isn't an actual tesla valve (i am not an engineer in any capacity)
Now imagine if he cut off the center-line like in a Tesla valve
You sound like your exhaling smoke all the time.

Maybe if you actually used the Tesla Valve and not whatever stupidity you came up with.
The program firms around here use to model floods is HEC-RAS
So what if the... Girth... of the city is much wider?
That's not a Tesla valve!
5:29 AYO💀💀💀🤨🤨🤨
WTF 7:39 😭🙏😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So this was a great watch, I'm just getting into your videos so maybe you've already done or are working on something like this, but, something shaped like common mufflers with baffles or chambers, maybe even some high flow stuff like those aftermarket delta chambers, just to see what the wave looks like going through. Your automotive enthusiast viewers might get a lot of information out of your results
5:25 after thousands of years of design, the cock and balls remains the gold standard for tsunami control😂
Good job you just made a suppressor
What Do You Mean When He Invented Electricity No He Just Figured Out How To Use It
Everyone is the comments:  actual sciency stuff  Me: it's so veiny
or just make a wall
this is more of a Tsunami suppressor than an actual tesla valve, there's a straight shot down the center for it to go down
So its basically like a firearms suppressor or car muffler but for water.
Congrats you made a liquid suppressor
No, you did not want to make it structureally sound you wanted to use your dam acronym word
You didn't make a Tesla valve at all. Not at all. You had an actual image of it. You knew exactly what it SHOULD look like. What a waste of a video.
You literally showed the original patent image of the tesla valve and then proceeded to make something that looks clearly different. You also have discovered that water pressure isn't a proper concept when you have an effectively infinite pipe volume due to height, since the waves can go higher instead of increasing their velocity. You are also using a pulse of water instead of a continous flow so the valve can't get working properly since the main wave has passed before the backflow kicks in.  All that said, the main issue seems to be that the physics engine here isn't suitable so all you have really done is bleed off some % of the wave with each set of walls and that's why it's smaller. What you've made is the same as just making a series of your initial narrow->wide "valves".
5:25 didn't see that coming.
I would argue that just closing the wall would have been a lot more cheaper and effective than the valve itself. If you need to have walls of 1km high over 30km long, this kind of defeat the point of having an anti-tsunami system. Just make a wall or even easier build the city on a mountain.
Who is here in 2025 🎉
Came here for the engineering, stayed for the dick jokes.
Ah yes, an extremely efficient pathway for the water to flow
Tesla probably had no inkling that his valve could be used for tsunami abatement, but knew it was important for mankind in the long run.  Seems this is feasible, but I think it’s safe to note that the channel wouldn’t need to encompass the whole city.  If you eliminated half of the channel (from the last value to the city), even reduced one of the “valves”, instead of the water continuing to be channeled all the way to the city, the remaining water could dissipate over a more vast area of land before it reaches city.  I mean, who wants to live in a punch bowl anyway?
The tsunami won't slow as the velocity is not provided by flow, but by a wave
Somebody get Japan on the phone
5:24 ayo☠️☠️
Can everybody please stop pretending that tsunami is a “technical term” or something? Yeah, alright, tidal wave is inaccurate. At least we knew what it meant. Let’s replace an inaccurate English term, with an inaccurate term from a foreign language and pretend we improved something. And just to be clear, yes, I know that tsunami isn’t foreign in Japan. If they want to use that word, fine. But I wish people outside of Japan would stop arguing that it’s somehow an upgrade. We all know it means harbour wave. If it starts or ends in a harbour, fine. Anywhere else, stop using incorrect language and, worse, insisting other people use it.
Bro made a suppressor
The valve should also start closer to where the water is entering from not about halfway like you currently have it at 1804 because you want the most protection you can get so it would make sense for it to be earlier in the channel which would allow more distribution of the water through the valve because you would have more space and places for the excess water to hit, and also before you hit the city should have had some more Tesla valves but having openings to let out outside of the whole channel and walls so that way the water would have an exit so it wouldn't hit the city anywhere near as much as it does by 19:30 almost like a exhaust vent for a car with a x shape side exhaust where or even a smokestack where you've got the little slits to let excess smoke out as it goes up
A tesla valve alternates from side to side, not mirrored on both sides.  Also the angles of flow line up to the next section.
... you didn't even make a real tesla valve, you just made a wedge valve, that's not the same thing
Who is in the year 2024 or 2025?
It’s a giant supressor….
Unnatural disaster is the best mobail physics But it costs about $7
This could've been really cool...
Im so mad tesla invented electricty. The world was fine before we had lightning and storms
"I think I'll just add a circular end.....  Me: sounds good. Adds to the challenge.  " Now these 90 degree corners here aren't very structurally sound... and we'll add these bracers.... Me: Neat bit of engineering that. Hmm. Looks good.....  Wait... Wait wai wai wai wait....  *Face plam*
Make thisnthe most liked comment pls
Fluid simulation is a nightmare to program
Tesla: brilliant   Also Tesla being my first cousin, four times removed: has me in distant relation and I can’t do shit 😊
Why did you say “electrithity
Well it’s a wiener joke.
The Sunami Supressor
Not too different from suppressor technology
The outline is sus
Pennies!
Wow, mature comment section 😅
You didn't make a tesla valve... your valve is  symmetrical down the shaft...tesla valve is asymmetrical down the shaft
Thats a penis
5:25 that’s the best engineering I’ve ever seen
I |guess| this isn’t a Tesla valve. That valve doesn’t let you flow directly from one point to another. At each iteration it tries to subvert the flow direction.
I just seen the thumbnail and came here to say that's not a tesla valve.
You're Welcome
Not tesla but Eddieson. Eddieson is responsible for most modern technology
My favorite thing with these are the flood systems that would cost more than the cities lol
The bracing is what did it for me. 😂😂
Making physics fun 🎉
I actually didnt expect the dick joke, i took the supporting piers thing at face value and stopped considering things
Is the Tesla Valve in the room with us?
In the first ten seconds I questioned if I was having a stroke
Yo 5:30 is a masterpiece 🔥✨
“There’s a bit. There’s a bob.” 😂🤣
No actual Tesla valve?
Cums simulation
I love the aesthetic design, very climatic. 😂
5:24 I like the design
TTD - about 5 minutes 50 seconds. Not bad.
This is more Bernoulli effect than tesla valve tbh
Not a tesla velve
The amount of computer power you need to have real world physics in a simulation is high and I could already tell that the water in this game doesn’t react at all like water lol more like goop or something
Precisa fechar um pouco os muros de contenção centrais que não estão ligados as laterais pra forçar mais pressão no fluxo que retorna ao mar
👑
This didn’t at all test what it set out to; the software was completely insufficient and that wasn’t a Tesla valve.
I saw the word "Tesla Valve" in my youtube front page and almost scrambled to check the news for the worst buyout imaginable.
I mean must sub😊
Ewery onebmus sub right now real engineers are osow watching
thats not really a tesla valve tho
The road shoulda went through a tunnel at the top of the tip.
Is this the city they call Bell's End?
What waking up in the morning feels like.
How about just build away from the shore safe enough from any tsunami
Dude makes this whole video and then completely botches the actual shape of a tesla valve lol  Still fun to watch
9:30 does not work cuz it is not isolated from “world”. Water speeds up not cuz of narrow output but higher hydrodynamic pressure.
These types of videos don’t need to be 19 minutes
Tesla was certainly the architect of our electrical grid!
Worst Tesla valve Ever.
It would need to be enclosed to work
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
Looking at this again what the shape does is effectively cut out 2/3's of the wave and then spread the remaining wave and then cut out 2/3's of it.  Basically if you take the energy of the initial wave it's multiplying it by 1/3 (0.333~) over and over until the remaining energy is negligible.  Every two times it does this it reduces the power by almost 90%.
5:24 it’s weird that nobody LOL here😂😂
Yes but tesla couldn't predict where they'd hit and neither can you or anyone else.
Uhhh pretty sure this a vertical valve that’s activated through air flow channels and gravity 😂idk how this will work on a flat surface
10:34 this is also how the baffle system works for firearm suppressors
MISSED OPPORTUNIY: delete bridge in front of train / watch train derail into water. Come on man. 2/10 making cock and balls in a video… 9/10
That isn't a tesla valve you build nor that's an tsunami - it ist only a big wave.
Crazy how much this guy talks
Unless I'm dumb this works the same way as a firearm silencer.
anything can stop a tsunami if its tall enough
Unfortunately, I just don't think this program can accurately model the physics of water well enough to demonstrate the Ingenuity of a Tesla valve.
Not quite a Tesla Valve but it does the job.
1:08 I know that valve I  saw that in left 4 dead
Alternate the valve locations, like the model
the "valves need to be staggered not across from each other. This would cause the waves to fight against each other on the rebound. your design is knocking it down, but not as much still to much energy.
Me with an advertizement degree hearing "Hello fellow engeneers" be like:
correction, his name was co-opted by one of the shadiest car manufacturers
put a crescent hill near the end to entirely cut it off from going further in XD + 2 curve stopper hills redirecting it back behind the crescent
Why cut out a hole in the middle of the wall? That's idiotic!
Yep! The dick shape was childish and in rather poor taste ...
Who would build something like this around every costal city insane expensive as opposed to building in a way that works with nature
5:25 I’m not the only one who didn’t see a city plan right? 😂
“Fastest growing car manufacturers ever*…” *Due to the Obama administration’s auto bailout.  It’s literally the reason Tesla was successful.
The valve is right you designed it wrong... There is not a straight unobstructed flow...
Balzz
I couldn't stop laughing
Is that a penis
13:41 considering theres a big whole down the middle yes yes he said it
The tsunami shouldn’t slow down, just a dissipation of energy… so smaller.  If the volume was restricted, so the wave couldn’t increase height, then it would speed/slow accordingly. The physics engine is correct.
What would happen if you applied the tesla valve theory but instead used deep trenches/tunnels. Essentially going down instead of up with the land.  And or combine the two? Make sure to start shallow and end deep when making tunnels.
Poor Tesla .... Americans ruining the world once again 😅     Only jokes guys dont be too triggered
Drew a penis wall
That is not a Tesla valve
6:54 "we have the tsunami going up the shaft..." Lmaoo bro wtf 😂😂😂
The physics you're using are for partical flow, the physics for this tsunami and how the water here moves is based upon wave physics. That's also why the water is not speeding up when the inlet narrows. Bernouli's principle does not apply for wave physics.
I like the videos! I'm subscribed
I hate to say it, but that's not a tesla valve. There in no through line, it's constantly fighting against walls on it's way down
Tesla valve is not valve - it's not works as valve
You need to take flow from one of the traps and redirect it back onto the flow going forward. There should not be a real visible straight through path visible. With water I would make each trap lift the water up then change direction and return back on itself.all while having to go over repeating ramps. Generally turning linear flow and momentum into chaotic turbulence.
5:24 look at it And he calls the top the tip
All that effort to save your city from a tsunami just to be obliterated by a meteor strike. 😢
5:25  Is that the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon?
makes me wanna write a simulation with particles so the speed thingy is represented ... but prolly just a thought I won't get to anytime soon ^^'
@5:25 Giggity
Bro didn’t even build a proper Tesla valve after continuously showing us a pic of a legit one 😂
So, not a Tesla valve. Why even bother
2 years on, and there are tools inside engines like Unreal that can simulate this a lot better. Maybe not full scale, but you could make miniature versions that would allow for this with greater realism.
this isn't a Tesla valve??
5:30 we all know what that looks like
Could've been a short
thats not a tesla valve though lol
how is the top comment not about the fact he just drew a penis?
Should have sent a wave through with no valve as a baseline for us.
Rice definitely called it a shaft.
5:24 that js looks so wrong😭
vito used to build better tsunami base in minecraft. unfortunetly he doesn't build bases now 😢
matt showing you how a vasectomy works
A real tesla valve is offset and staggered
You should call it the d**k valve 😂
I thought the valves were supposed to be offset
To be fair, a tesla valve stopping a tsunami aalso requires walls that could stop a tsunami without the valve... Kinda curious to see how well it does with like, half height walls.
Nice cocktail and balls, good form sir
First defense was a giant Penis! Sorry, mind in the gutter.
Structural braces, you say? I might have to try those on my next outing to the.... BRO!   the most subtle meat and potatoes joke ever
The design of this valve is… confusing
Water going up is very very sussy
5:24 why does that look like a dick💀
You should of just made the river a Tesla valve. They follow fast in one direction but slow the other.
Your Tesla valve design is wrong
I can't not see the dong
THIS VIDEO IS A TARP!  beware

The reason it work as it should be because maybe, the tsunami on coming in 1 wave. In reality the water keep coming
Dude left a huge gap down the middle. Did he even look at the Tesla valve at all what he made looks nothing like it

Don't smother each other. No one can grow in the shade.
the irony of Tesla level physics being programed into the game.... but not geology/material science...
I think the reasom the velocity didnt change is because you just forced it to compress in 2 dimensions, not in 3, so if you made it more funnel-like with it not being a slit, but a hole/tunnel it may work better
he just made a cock and balls, with veins, not an actual tesla valve, omg i can't with this sh*t
yu ain’t right for that 😂😂😂😂😂
17:50 if you came here for a simple yes or no answer 😐
5:24 is defo no tesla valve... can't believe you had to call out the tip too lol!
I think you are a bit confused. When waves "clash" against each other, they don't neutralize each other or push one another. They go through each other. This valve doesn't make sense when considering waves as it was made for fluids flowing inside tubes.
VALVe
5:24 idk abt u but that looks kinda sus... 😅
6:53  I’m sorry, HEADING UP THE SHAFT????
That’s not a Tesla valve. Aren’t you an engineer?
I thought tesla valves do not have a straight path in the centre?
Just wondering why you made this a huge penis with hairy testicles?
5:29 Ay Yo
Wait, so, add this to the mouths of rivers in Japan
Here’s where he actually tests his “Tesla Valve” (even though it’s a baffled suppressor design and not what he says it is) so you don’t waste twelve minutes and ten seconds of your time.  12:10
Given it's....'unique' design. I feel like it should be called the Stopcock
I feel like given the look from the air someone should mention the importance of using protection to avoid emergencies 😂
No! Fluid mechanics is a CHEMICAL ENGINEERING discipline!!

Nice work! The issue is that in real life it's infeasible to build talk walls like those. The closest thing would be the Dubai linear city.

Bro didn't realize what he had made at 5:28
Engineer trying to built tesla valve accidentaly built suppressor
9:39 no the hydraulic theory definitely doesn’t mean that. It’s like a reduction valve without the pressure
A tsunami isn't just one wave, it happens because the sea level is higher than the ground level or beaches..... So a Tesla valve can't do anything about the level of the water it's still gonna teach it but it can remove the force behind it significantly also delay it a lot more to give people enough time to evacuate.
Why did you leave the space? 🤔
i saw him draw a cock and balls this man is not an actual civil engineer
Definitely built the valve wrong. 😑 c’mon man, you had a picture and everything… lol 🤦🏼‍♂️
5:25 💀
The thing about the tesla valve is that it allows water to flow almost freely in one direction but almost entirely prevents water to go in the other direction
this all looks so dirty lol 😂
5:25 this looks familiar to something     || ○||○                                                   BALLS?
Did you hear about the guy who dipped his testicles in glitter?          It’s pretty nuts.  Nice commentary and …
5:24 Great Design
"I guess we can call that the tip", he says.
The fluid sim is pretty accurate… A tesla valve slowing down the flow happens when a pipe is full of water, by reducing the flow that passes through it.  A smaller wave IS A REDUCED FLOW.  In a pipe, there’s no air to fill the vacuum when some of the water keeps flowing forward and there’s a giant fucking gap between that water and the rest of the water.  It isn’t the game sim being inaccurate.  Your applying knowledge from one test to a separate test where water behaves differently than you would expect.  Also, Tesla’s wedges clearly interlock, and cross the centerline of the pipe in the photo YOU showed.  So you were not testing a Tesla valve, in a non pipe.  With a pretty solid simulation software that you were bashing for giving pretty realistic results that were contrary to your expectations.  Because you’re an idiot.
Too sad game has no good hydrodynamic simulation
Isnt this a more like a simplistic gun supressor (not a tesla valve)?
6:00 Kinda looks like u made a Tesla Penis to stop the Tsunami haha
i live up a river channel where weve had a number of tsunamls flood up it in recent years. albiet small tsunamis (1 metre high) not mega ones... the main difference is that the waves dissapate but the tide doesnt... the river level rises and falls like a tide coming in and out every 10 minutes... it does this for like 24 hours untill the sea settles. The currents are really strong and rip boats off their moorings
What an odd question it was never made to stop flow
Jelly in corner? 17:25
Essentially, what you made was a firearm suppressor, not a Tesla valve, as many others have mentioned.
9:43 the water isn’t going to increase its speed due to the wave energy only transfer to increase the amplitude of the wave hence it is the reason why the wave will seem higher when the wave approach at the end. Diffraction won’t change the frequency of the wave
5:24
Got much more invested when got to know the Tesla in the title refers to Nikola tesla and not the brand lol
we need Jschlatt reacting to this
6:06 I bet.

Oh yes, Niko Tesla, one of the most famous American innovator/inventor👏
I dont get it. Litterally a 10 second search result shows this isnt a true tesla valve.
TTP for this video was 5:30 not disappointed
Tesla valves are supposed to have an offset entrance...
Given that actual tesla valves don't have open channels in the middle but instead alternate the pathway, I reckon this could work a lot better.
Still funny
I like how they all just kept driving to their deaths 😭
You got us at 5:23
I'm not watching this trash video because that is not a tesla valve in the thumbnail. No one should take anything you do seriously ever.
This is not a Tesla valve. A Tesla valve doesn't have an open channel straight through the middle of it.   I see you did another video one week after doing this one, where you make a proper Tesla valve.
5:29😂😂😭😭😭😭
Yeah lets go nikola tesla is from Croatia
ce jeu est un alien WTF
Or maybe... just maybe... don't make an opening in your wall at the beginning. That will keep your city bone dry ;-)
I have a question, sorry if it's stupid. Is there a reason you didn't make the loops alternate like it was on the figure?
Goddamn, Pirate Software was right - TTP (Time To Penis) really is a thing.  In this case, it was 5 minutes and 25 seconds.
5:23 *sighs*  *opens comments*

Why waste all the energy of the initial wave...
I hope the residents of Bell End City were grateful for your intervention
"Nikola Tesla, one of the main contributors to the invention of electricity..." I have never before bailed out of an video this fast. Couldn't stand that phrase.
Completely wrong shape….
5:30 bit weird
Tesla valve is just an over engineered check valve
Judging by your understanding of Tesla valve, I hope I'll never have to be in a building that you've helped design.
Was the big cock and balls accidentall?
Bro seriously made a dick
You were surprised at the smaller slower wave test you expected to speed up, but most valves are under pressure, and your wave isn't. So it creates, and you can even see, it creates feedback x. The water converges, fights itself, and because it lacks pressure, kicks back against the rest of the forward progress. Your fluid mechanics are based on pressurized hydrolic flow, not unpressurized forward motion fluid mechanics. Like a reef breaks waves.... Not like a valve forces pressure my guy
am no gonna say it but it looks like my dads JUNK IN HIS TRUNK. ABIT SHAVED THO.
At 5:25 it looks like a long dildo with hairy balls 🤣
Its sad that its not free cus i want to play it too Like this comment if u want too
Here from ludwig; great stuff!
Edison invented d c current nicole tesla invented alternating current dc current is good for batteries
you should show us non tesla valve result
The philosophical nature of the structure and the tsunami is incredible
5:26 haha
Halfway through, you made a blood vessel! The shape of the open valves help speed up the flow of blood. Biology, bitches!
One type of valve, fears number 3
giant penis 😂
That's hilarious he made a dick and balls with hair.
7:11 there is a specific shape
every time i'm like oh ok i learnt sth new and then he zooms out and.. GOD DAMMIT
It always confused me that "valves" are devices that let you turn a fluid flow on/off, but _also_ "valves" are devices that prevent backflow.  I know that when a sealed pipe increases or decreases in diameter that changes the linear speed to conserve the volumetric flow rate, but does that even apply to open channels? The water getting deeper or shallower handily accounts for the same volumetric flow in the same cross-sectional area to have the same linear speed.  Also I'm a bit sceptical that the "tesla valve" is actually having any real effect on this, by the time the water is flowing backwards out of the baffles, the main wavefront has already passed. I suspect that simply having a bunch of piers sticking out into the flow _without_ looping backwards would have the same effect.
So the name has nothing to do with the electric cars. Good
Shorter, multiple channels? Also, angle them slightly so you have more deflection?
What would happen if the city wall was circumcised?
Interesting shape haha
Look at a tesla valve then look at yours, you valves were set in pairs and not staggered
5:23 nah am i the only one seeing this
Game name
What’s to stop the people at the waterfront selling their houses to aquaman?
これはTesla valvesの効果ではなく、単純に一段目の防波堤で水量の3/4程が返されたことで津波の減衰しただけですね。 なお、Tesla valvesは流体(連続する波)に対して効果を発揮するものなのでpulse waveの津波にはほとんど効果はないと思いますよ。
😂 you made a suppressor baffles
That is an interesting attempt to experiment a "tesla valve-like" contraption to stop the tsunami advance.  However, like what the previous YT user pointed out, it is not done correctly, hence it failed to stop the tsunami from reaching the city.
Bro ... come on 8===D
Hi
this must be an adult only city because the bracing piers
you need to make the middle walls longer at both ends and you need to make the first wall shorter
This is not a Tesla valve???
Can you transform the design for power generation
I’m sorry but am I the only one to think the walled channel looks like a giant cock and balls??????
The hydrau.ic force of countless thousands of tons would likely rupture the walls of your theoretical tesla valve but i like the idea!
😂😂😂😂😂looks like big willy and balls with spikie hairs on them,,😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:39 Whyyyyyy Why did u have to?? WHY
I think you're oversimplifying when you say wider = slower and that the game is not simulating this correctly.  Just think of a wide channel and add a wall parallel to the flow, but nearer to one side.  Ignoring the friction at the edges, the wall does nothing and it clearly will not affect the speed on either side. The narrow and wider parts will flow at the same speed.  It's only when you restrict a flow that it will speed up, but then if it widens again after the restriction, it also slows back down to maintain the constant mass flow.  Further more, here you're open from above, so the water can also pile up *instead* of speeding up, again maintaining the constant mass flow.
Didn’t invent electricity, 😂harnessed it in a different way but look outside during a storm and you can see the invention of electricity, the almighty God!
You did not make anything remotely similar to a tesla valve
Hi
This is not a Tesla valve. Google for it and try again. Results may be interesting.
"We'll call it the tip"!
Not a tesla valve, not good simulator \
And you couldn't make tesla valve even when you had picture of it.
why is it so addictive
More like a suppressor than a tesla valve.
discovery not invention
Tesla valves work better with continuos liquid flow.
5:26 bro what is that
I'd like to see this on more sophisticated software.
This is a dick joke.
All the children: "if China makes a bunch of stuff what does this city produce?"
Tesla doesn't deserve to have his name dragged through the mud by the failures of the muskrat
I think doing a tsunami double slit experiment would be awesome
I hope you know that it can never completely stop the water from floating.
that shape tho 5:27
Tesla vales dont look like what you made. A wave is not the same as flow. I hope you're not actually an engineer. waves dont slow down by expanding or contracting. Utter nonsense.
7:15-7:51 Kinetic energy is no joke.
How did an engineer try so much without offsetting the sides?
5:23 ok let's not get ahead of ourselves now😂
Now we need a time machine to take this design back to ATLANTIS
My thoughts:  The volume of water in a tsunami wave will still be trying to get through the restrtiction but at a slower rate.  A 40 ft tsunami will still flood the same area to the same depth but the water will rise slower - maybe..  Water waiting to get through will rise above the 40 ft initial wave and will probably overtop the restriction.  That's why a tsunami in the open ocean may be only 3-6 ft high until it reaches the shoreline.  No place for the water to go but up.
tesla dong 🤣
5:25 wtf
Tesla valves are great but they are too easy to get clogged up with blood you know how it is.
You know that tsunami stopper City thing you made looks like a giant cock and balls right?
mans allergic to monetization
You should have your diagonal Channels overlapping alternately which would work better.
that's,, not a tesla valve but i doubt it would have mattered with the games physics lol
The description of the speed of the wave in smaller spaces is completely wrong.  What you were describing is true for pipes where there is nowhere for the water to go, but not true for a wave where there can still be upward displacement.  Instead wave speed is governed by the shallow water wave equations where you can show that wave speed is related to water depth.  i.e. the shallower the water the slower it travels.  This is why waves traveling at an angle to a shoreline will still refract toward the shore and often end up breaking nearly straight on.
Tesla valves are NOT symmetrical.
Brother, you got education, gaming and humor all rolled into one. That's how you get subs.
Tesla Valve??? waiting to see one lol
Простой стеной было бы проще и дешевле защитить город.
VALVES ARE VALVES
You drew a penis😂😂
after watching this i realized you have no idea how to build an actual tesla valve.
16:20 aaaand this is why physicists joke about engineers 🤦‍♂️
Why not building a wall without any openings but have a door instead?
Is he trolling? He just drew a dick 😂
5:23 ayo this looks a bit sus
How about if the shaft widens along the way, spreading the energy from a point to a wider area. The opening can be narrow, the end point is wide.
This does not work like a tesla valve at all even though it kind of looks like one.  You could have done so much better. It is the spirit of the tesla valve that is important if applying it to something like a tsunami. And that spirit is to turn the energy back on itself.  this design basically just uses partial blocking and spreading the wave of what remains.  your first step should have just been some outer ramps to divert the outer edges in wards to create a low pressure on the flanks, then the second step would be a central pointy island making the water go from the center to the outer. the idea is to split the stream in two and both are starting to S flow.  The third section would be outer ramps again but this time a slightly tighter turn so that the two waves smash each other by hopefully at least 45 degrees.  Your design is absolutely massive and leaves very little flow rate for other uses.  I have never used this game or any engineering programs. It is not my field, I am into climate science and the inventions that can help. (bespoke, not mainstream sheep stuff).  In the real world, where we would want to use all of that land for other purposes, we COULD actually make a really clever design based on using half a tesla valve on its side as a line of trenches.  picture yourself aproaching land from the perspective of the wave.  As you get closer, in front of you a massive hydraulic trapdoor opens upwards in front of you. it can be small,  in the sense of depth, but it would need to be the length of entire beaches to catch a tsunami.  But this trapdoor opens upwards and the design it to use the weight of the wave above and the forward force, to ram scoop the undercurrent of the tsunami into pipes that ARE designed to speed up the water to make it get ahead of the main wave, to then do a u turn and come out as high pressure jets blowing exactly the opposite way, so to the top part of the wave, it is now rolling over a surface of water that is jetting back out to sea far faster than it is heading inland.  practically a high speed water escalator for the wave to run on until it plays itself out.
Nice simulation but one thing I’d like to point out is that you left a straight channel down the middle while the Tesla valve has the curves offset to each other. That will create the most effective reversal of the flow for you. I would say try offsetting them and rerun the simulation. I can 99.9% guarantee you’ll stop the tsunami entirely and maybe reverse it. It should not make it past 2 or three of those curves. Just an observation hope it helps 👍🏻
I dont need t see the entire video, you just build it WRONG!
He did not invented electricity
Yoooo cool
In a middle of a video it looks more like flat gun suppressor)
B=====D
The valves are supposed to be offset
You could put a pump at the end to keep any water that DOES make it at bay
5:31 that shape…….
what if your first set or two of valves start in the water?
How to build your own suppressor. 😂👍
@5:24 congrats you drew a huge dick.
That’s not a Tesla valve that’s a muffler.. why did it take you so many tries to still fail at this?
Why is your tsunami wave so narrow/short? Tsunami videos I have seen show a much wider wavelength, where the wave length is many times greater than the amplitude, causing the water to attack the shoreline for a much longer duration.
Not a Tesla valve, needs to alternate with the baffles so the wave needs to swing and can be disrupted. This is just a silencer or muffler
Saw this a while ago then realized the simulation here is a little inaccurate. The center channel of the valve is not supposed to just be straight. That would a center stream to be the fastest flow with only run off going through the side paths. The actual Tesla valve as actually shown in the beginning of this video has the main channel go back and forth so the main channel directs the majority of the water towards the redirecting path.
Could large counter-vortex generator towers in western Texas, western Oklahoma and western Kansas impede tornado development across much of central and eastern U.S.?  Maybe 400-foot high wing-shaped towers made of steel, aluminum and/or carbon fiber.  No moving parts, no energy requirement, would just induce vortices in the moving air mass by their aerodynamic shape that would be counter rotational to tornado development vortices.  May sound like a stupid or crazy idea, but is there some possibility there?
@5:24 I’m an adult I’m adult I’m an adult
This is obviously a copy of the famous engineering team of Dick and Harry Balls.
The water shouldn't get much quicker should it?  The pressure isn't going to rise because it's an open system.  Shouldn't it just get deeper?  I guess the pressure will rise closer to thr ground and spit out slightly quicker, but as a whole it'll just rise, right?
im curious whatd happen if u connected those middle flood walls and they blocked the middle forcing the tsunami to either side @RealCivilEngineer
Tsunami silencer.
Thus doesn't prooves much. You should do the same experiment with the Tesla Valves reversed and then measure differenses (in amplitude after the output). And then only reach conclusions.
With this setup you need a fork diversion (or single) after the "tesla valve"
That’s not a Tesla valve.
w a l l .
Feature meeee
Reminds me of the valves in human veins. I wonder if that's where Tesla got his inspiration?
i missed the part where you build a  tesla valve
Thats NOT a Tesla valve, you're no real civil engineer (degrees do not make you an expert)
What an interesting question!
you could have used a height map to import  your design more easily than hand drawing it in game
Awesome
Is this how a vasectomy works?
for now we know how Dysuria looks like from inside
sigh... reverse the last one you made and give that a shot. like rather then build it from the sides in, build it from the center out.
literally has a diagram of a tesla valve and builds something completely different.
You don`t understand how tesla valve works at all, there is no reduction with a single wave in your  "tesla" valve, because bypass is 2+ times longer then a main passage... All we see is spliting front wave several times, without waves collapsing each other
@5:25 Looks like the part of a male.
5:24 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 bro built my Jonn😂😂
Get on with it! - an inpatient man
You aren't getting the effect of the valve because the short straights do not channel the water back into the main flow, you have the water crashing into a sharp corner, losing the entire effect the valve is designed to produce. Are you not that bright, or are you intentionally being dim? The water is supposed to speed up make a sweeping curve, and flow back into the main wave, effectively reducing it's power, with itself. What you made, can hardly be called a Tesla Valve. none of the flutes are staggered.
You made the loops to long also. It is like you don't seem able to understand the hydrodynamics of water.
If you stager the loops, then there is no direct attack path to the city, why are you dragging it out so much?
I just remembered this was my first (or third, same difference) video of RCE (⁠ʃ⁠ƪ⁠＾⁠3⁠＾⁠） AH the nostalgia of discovering you 😂
When you do something like that again each time you make it again make it smaler bc youre just throwing the water that went through tesla voul in another same tesla voul. its like throwing water through a cleaner of the same tipe 2 times
5:21 nice cawk 😊
If you really wanted this to work, you'd put a wedge shaped wall in the center. It would split the water into the Tesla valve and force it into the channels.
I feel like, instead of a third being the gap here, to account for the less realistic wave flow physics, going to a quarter (even 28%) would be sufficient to prevent the water from reaching the city. The larger curves to the valves should also prevent the overspill, which, while not rebounding as fast as in real life, still adds enough reverberation to limit the wave's flow. Definitely an interesting experiment, and a credit to the game designers for this being even remotely quantifiable.
bro built a cross section of a silencer for water
5:30 hmmmmmmmm nice shape😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:26 giggity
Whatever you do do not look at 5:28
A point for trying to make it educational but you have no clue about hydrodinamics
It looks like a silencer from a gun
Built a distinctively *not* tesla valve. How excellent
This guy has the original tesla valve blue print but created his own. How nice
05:17 🤔
you talk too much
I think we all saw that coming.
Thenpeople in this game drive like people inn toronto
But, but, but the narrow gap lets a third through and two thirds is stopped by the walls (same height as on the beach). Then a third of the third makes it through the second valve and a third of a third of the third makes it through the third valve.  So there's a twenty seventh of the wave still heading for the city and you claim it's because of the design of the tesla valve.
Have you tried it in Timberborn?
The Tesla valve is not intended to stop water but to slow down and reduce the flow.
a tesla valve doesn't leave an open canal in the middle, good video though!
Another to try might be "Waves hitting a Sierpinski carpet" there's a youtube video with that title and a follow up in 3D...
Not the correct shape.
NOT A TESLA VALVE. IT LOOKS LIKE A GUN SILENCER

Why does he have to make everything upwards down T shaped?
Not a tesla valve.
You need the arms to stagger into the middle, there shouldn't be a straight path. Cool to watch tho
This is not the TESLA VALV
That’s a terrible Teslas valve
When you think about it, electricity is a kind of very fast fluid dynamics with lots of equivalents like resistance being like friction and relative charge being like relative pressure.
5:23 You couldn’t resist, could you?

The only reason u made it "structualy sound" was to make that shape  I cant believe utube agreed with this
Tesla valves work on steady flows.
You should have built your tesla valve along the river. Problem solved.
Sure doesn't look like a tesla valve.
WOW that is the best idea i have ever seen. Nice man!
5:25 dude for real?😂
You didn’t make a Tesla valve dude. A Tesla valve is asymmetrical and staggered loops that weave the water. You have an open channel right through the center. As an “engineer” I’m surprised you could call your attempt a “Tesla valve” without hesitation, because you’d think you should be able to tell the difference from the picture you showed and what you made.
Not a Tesla valve.
waste of time. not even a tesla valve
bro drew a huge dong
It looks nothing like the Tesla value.
Not a tesla valve it has no height restriction
Mmmmmmm, this shape reminds me of something...
Everything about this video is wrong, Except for the Fact that the Tesla valve does exist.... The valves are meant to be staggered hahahaha. You would get exactly the same result if you just had straight lines the same length in place of the valves, at those angles. They are  just dissapating energy. The other fail is that a Tsunami has its greatest energy in that first wave mound, its not like the rest of the ocean behind it is the same height as the face, so therefor once the first wave passes, there is no " back pressure " to make use of the vavles affect, as they are only affecting the water behind the main wave. So the valves directing the water back towards the sea aren't expending energy against the Actual Tsunami, That's already well past the valves.....
It's a giant Johnson!
Telsagasm
5:23 - 😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, this is hilarious, it's Nikola Tesla's concept valve which requires no moving parts; basically you install this valve & never have to touch it again! However us men can't but help ourselves turn it into complete clown show lol. Who said thinking with your penis was a bad idea!
haven't watched the video yet but i guess it won't stop the water cause the physics aren't simulated accurate enough
Actually Tesla created power plants that mass produce, and spread electricity. Of course the idea was stollen by someone else. Like how someone tried to steal the patent for the radio.
His example tesla valve had the structures offset from side to side instead of symmetrical. This would increase the forces going from straight to the city to going g side to side.
Cities Skylines II is out, so I wonder if this would work in that.
Say a city has a giant wall like this, would the water even stay a giant wave or would it flatten pretty much instantly
Check out integsa
frustrating that he never actually made the Tesla valve.....
You have to stagger them
5:29 the good old fashioned cock and hairy balls design
cool, now we just have to build big walls everywhere‼️
Made a 20 minute video about a Tesla valve and then never even used one in the simulation 🙄.... What you made is a firearm suppressor baffles which works on water the same as it does air because both are fluid...... A Tesla valve is entirely different and it should be specifically noted that a Tesla valve is a one-way valve.. There is no straight through path on a Tesla valve like You made in your simulation game
Definitely a better entertainer than the engineer, still a nice one 👌
As you see, the reverse wave needs longer to come back than the forward wave to go through, wo the tesla valve should be optimal for constant flow, where a little spill at the beginning doesn't matter, as the reverse pressure needs some time to be built up.
You didn't make a Tesla valve.
First, he made a weewee, at 10:42 he made a cervix. This is a very naughty video.  🤣
The Dutch is watching this intensely.
Offset them and should be more efficient
5:24 SuS
Future me did the Tesla valve stop the tsunami?
The first man to put a TH in the word electricity. Lolol silly fucking brit. 😂
builds a "tesla" valve but builds it wrong.... the tesla valve has no direct line of "sight" down the middle
We need one of these long Johnsons on the Washington coast!
Doesnt work cause it wasnt correct. Youve made a straight path through the middle. Something you dont want
Bro drew a d1ck for a valve and city and we just aren't gonna talk about it... lol
Isnt the opening the to the tesla valve incorrect? The front itself is cutting 2/3rds of the flow before it even enters the valve where in other tesla valve examples, it shows them using the entire flow from a source.
that jew joke.....
これは津波ではない
You make silencer?
imagine trying this in CS 2 , impossible because of the shitty game. THey really ruined it
Это не клапан Теслы
Мдя... Смыс тестить етот тип... Одиночной волной она на поток ращитан....
7:38 If you hadn't fixed that major issue, I was just straight going to report you...  Next time gadget, next time
Wave needs to be larger!
Should do this again, but start the valve close to the water’s entrance.
I think if you off set the top and bottom parts of the valve with your flood walls and narrowed the long parts of the wall a bit, so they nearly overlapped, you could prevent the Tsunami from even exiting the second valve.
The more often you mention being an engineer, the less I believe you actually are one. You would be only half as annoying if you stepped back on that crap a little.
Everyone we need to thanks to Tesla because he is the reason why we are living
This should definitely be marked NSFW haha
How about trying the double-slit experiment?
flood river or dam...
Stupid reasonings
So we have a penis shaped water defense system. Interesting
05:02 i know where this is going🌚😂
Can you really call it a valve it depends on pressure and flow to stop anything otherwise water will just flow through and it will never stop water just slow it down
I love how he didn't get the part where there aren't supposed to be a straight line though it but a diagonal one
So basically: Tesla invented the foundation for gun silencers? 😮
7:40 no reason to apologize we all wanted to see it 👍
&z

5:25 nearly wet my pants :D
¡¡¡ No Tesla valve !!!
That is not a Tesla Valve, look similar but angle and ratio size all different
Dude made a suppressor for a wave
Would the results be the same for just 90 degree baffles spaced at the same distances in this fluid "sim"? To me it just looks like Cities: Skylines is just reducing the volume of the water by about a third every time it reaches a baffle and then it spreads out the remaining water horizontally. The water being redirected backwards in this way doesn't seem any different than if the water was being redirected backwards from just a straight wall.  Not criticizing Tesla here, since the sim in this obviously isn't real water physics. I'm just doubt CIties: Skylines is realistic enough where the Tesla valve actually works as well as it ought to.
Hi tsunami
Someone please tell him that Tesla valve have no effect on first wave. This wave is getting smaller only because he adds more side ways for water. Tesla valve works for constant stream, but not for 1 wave...
5:23 You just made a giant cock and balls. lol
WOW
Telsa Valves don't have a clear line from front to back - There needs to be a redirection that forces the flow from 1 direction to run 180* the other way. Each portion of the valve is also staggered as well.  It was entertaining - But this isn't really a Tesla Valve!
Im the only one that can see massive shaft as he put it and big Balls at the base . Look at location of the city😂  love it.  The long and veiny of it 😂🤣
The path through was not straight in the Tesla design. That is the flaw in yours.
I don't know but I'm pretty sure a Tesla on fire can destroy the Universe
I saw your updated Tesla valve. I would be interested to see the whole tsunami steered into a single giant Tesla valve lobe but it is ramped so when the wave is steered around 180 degrees it is ejected back into the bay from a height.
Looks like the inside of a silencer can.
You realize it looks like a giant punishment don't you?
This is not a Tesla valve kids
5:31 thanks for the laugh
Not actually a tsunami.  Just a big wave.
Why wasn't this actually designed as a Tesla valve? It's just letting smaller and smaller sections of the wave through and spreading them out.
Only… that is not a Tesla valve… Its more like a supressor (silencer)
19:43 Tesla valves are offset so the water constantly fights. Why did you make yours completely symmetrical
Giggity…
Shape of Tsunami is not a short hump. The highest portion of the wave continues at least for few hundreds of meters behind it .
Stagger the left and right side; not symetrical (mirror image)
Looks a lot like a firearm suppressor.
Tesla made AC current and made inventions for both direct and alternating currents, but pretty sure Ben Franklin discovered it.
you don't know how to build a tesla valve. Check the plans and try again
fluid flux v2 might make real time fluid simulation possible to this level in games eventually, and for a price of few hundred bux
Your opening statement is an understatement. Tesla discovered alternating current and made long distance transmission of electricity possible. Edison lost the competition with his inferior direct current system. If not for Tesla, you would not have a YouTube channel. No one would.
Not the Tesla Valve I was expecting. I want to see the more common version that most People are familiar with.
HAHAHA I was thinking "Am I the only one feeling like an eleven year-old looking at a cock&balls?
Why am I so late 😂😂
hehe Penis
But do we realistically have anything that could withstand a straight hit from a tsunami? That we could hypothetically build this from?
That shape looks suspicious🤨
You did this with elements of the Tesla Valve but not a true one. Great first step though. Cant wait for your video of the whole design.
I'm not sure if you realize what the shape of your Tesla valve looks like LOL
At the time 5:55 it says “jelly fix” why? Don’t know
Bro use your brain and make a wall
Guy literally said 8=======D
Hello, Correct me if im wrong, The tesla valve is used to accelerate not dissipate
Big company n****s be branding regular words so much I thought a Tesla Valve was some sort of bizarre collab between Steam and Elon Musk for a sec
invention of electricity ??
Bro what 5:20
The only thing realistic about this are the cars impatiently tailgating the tsunami.
I love to see more City you make king😮
You should try in a water simulation game
At Start it Looks a Bit sus or is it only my Dirty mind
it's not hard to google how an actual tesla valve looks like
I'm so glad Nikola Tesla created Cities: Skylines
you can’t compare waves to water in a pipe! Narrowing the area where a wave can go through will do exactly what the game simulated and not make the wave go faster, like you said! That only applies to Liquids in a pipe
Skip to 17:53 for the test!
Plus cardiac (heart) valves.
Do this in Cities: Skylines II please 🙋‍♂️
Stop a tidal wave with Tesla valve principles*  Would be cool to see what it does designed the way Tesla made it (with the staggering loops, rather than right next to each other)  I think it would affect the back pressure.  And cudos to this city builder game
My brain sees the valve version no1 as a phallus.  I hate myself.
I can clearly see by the thumbnail that's not a Tesla valve
Interesting and, I think, familiar shape
Just add a wall
You should retest this in city skylines 2 as we know the water physics is not accurate. The reason the valve is not behaving properly is because down the small channels it is not speeding up. Which should hit the curve, and push back against the main wave in the center.
Are you seeing what I’m seeing 5:24 nah bro 7:40
Engineer ... have u ever seen Tesla Valve ? . This video is like comparing horse to a car
at the city limits you should have had a canal/trench for the water to run into leading either to a lake or a hydroplant
Not a proper Tesla valve.
Me @ 5:14 "it's a dong isn't it?" Me @ 5:23 "yerp"
I wonder if they've improved the water physics in Cities 2.  It would be interesting to try this again.
That’s a suspiciously phallic looking city you got there
Hmm... that's an interesting shape for a brace... oh, I see what you did there.
Seeing how this works on Skylines 2 would be interesting
7:40  "Sorry, sorry everyone"  You're not sorry, don't lie
5:24 bro this thing is sussy
Did he not realize he made a PP 5:24
I just noticed the shape at the end of the video 💀
Wave has superposition so waves coming from opposite directions won't cancel each other. The dampening of tsunami wave demonstrated here is probably not due to Tesla valve, just dispersion
5:23 my dirty mind can't handel this
omg I laughed so hard 5:24
he knew what he was doing with that shape lol
Cheeky supporting structures there at 5:30. Well done sir.
5:30, you got me sooo good lmao
We need integza to see this.
The beginning has such a familiar shape.hmmm🤔
5:29 📸🤨🍆 that is not sus at all💀☠☠💀☠☠
I hate that tou made this video knowing that the segments should always be  overlapped to the diagrams spec. But hey. If you show how wrong it can be versus how it should be you wouldnt have a video
Judging by the thumbnail, that isnt the correct valve
this guy is gay jk
ok,  you got me
Can you make one which is actually a tesla valve? Put the real shape to the test.
the game seems to use the shallow water equations which have a lot of limitations because it's height-based, one of them is that it doesn't follow the Bernoulli principle, the only pressure taken into account is the hydrostatic pressure so things like the negative gradient of the pressure of the Navier-stokes equations also are missing, viscous forces and shear forces are also ignored and velocity is conserved(as long as (∂h/∂x, ∂h/∂y)=0 ∀x,y). the SWE is great for large masses of water like seas oceans, and lakes but not great for tesla valves  because velocity is purely dependent on (∂h/∂x, ∂h/∂y)
It’s a big ball sack
16:23 but the water in the narrow part has a longer way, so it wouldn't necessarily have to be in the same space earlier than the rest, would it? 🤔
You did the valve completely wrong
5:23-5:27 balls rewatch your video lol
it busted
7:35 👍
*No nut november starts* Him:
Did he just create a massive land penis…..
5:23 it’s looks like a 🍆💀💀
Great excuse to build a giant penis.
Electricity wasnt invented, it was discovered.
So, a Tesla valve could reduce / prevent the Tsunami to protect the city? Yes.  But.  A civilisation that could build sea-walls that high to make a tsunami Tesla valve could just have built a straight sea wall without the Tesla valve and stopped the water without all the extra construction of the valve.  Lesson?  Don’t get so caught up in cool complicated things when the simple solution is as good or better, and much easier / cheaper.
Tesla's wireless electricity tower is the basis for modern day Wi-Fi. He also invented the first florescent bulbs. He is never given enough credit.
Everyone in the comments being scientific and I’m still laughing you made a penis will walls and said we will call this the tip
You do realize what that looks like? 🍆
Kind of looks like a straight banana
E
Should be possible so long as both structure and Tsunami wave does not exceed max potential.
5:30 🥚
me thinking the tesla valve is a car model 😆
Dong valve
I love that the mere mention of Nikola Tesla brings the crazies out in full force.
I think you may have missed the operating principle of the valve. I believe the center path does a zig zag
In the beginning it looks a little sus…
Elon Tesla is an inspiration to all.
The wave in a canal doesn't work as a wave in a tube. In a canal there is nothing to limit the height of the wave that why the energy in the wave will push the wave higher without affecting the speed too much. In a tube it's different the energy in the wave cannot push it higher so it will push it faster.
respectfully, you have not made a tesla valve
Although successful, isn’t the Tesla valve more for a constant flow of liquid?
From how I know what Tesla build to look like this does not look like a Tesla valve it looks somewhat like one but this thing is like two of them together but parallel with one another weather supposed to be offset in every other
thank god this video exists  now i dont have to try it myself
THE TIP?! man that really is sus same as the shape
is no one gonna acknowledge the fact that it looks like a P*NIS! xD I can't believe no one will even mention it!
Family friendly approved by nickeh30
16:38 here ya go
My profile pic is mood
5:24 lmfaooo im dead
Hi=)
You should go and watch the tesla valve again there should not be any straight pass through the valve the curves in the design are there for a reason
5:30 You got to be kidding me mate!
5:26 💀
5:24 sorry nut what….
This isn't a tesla valve and that isn't the theory behind it. The wikipedia page explains it very well if you want to know how it should work.
Ok, whichever one of you gets the next Dubai contract.. you know what to do.
5:25 are you aware? 💀💀💀
Bro this is just wrong😂
You should try this again but with a Tesla Valve.
It kinda sus
Is it just me or did he not actually build a tesla valve?
5:24 thats surely uhm nothing
Scrotumopolis vs Mega Tsunami 😂
What if we kissed 🙈 at the tesla valve tsunami beaches 😳
Busting sea water 😂
my friend my man my fellow engineer        JUST ENCIRCLE THE CITY WITH FLOOD WALLS
why not do sue na me vs sue na me
Is that a P-
Yea I Never liked games like this neither Understand wtf to do Or Playing it its just so Boring because of it  but you made this all so freaking fun i had 2 days off from Work and i used most of those hours watching your stuff ,  you really made this game fun as hell
@7:40 I was ready to unsubscribe if you didn’t do this.
I'd love to see you try this on Timberborn, the fluid dynamics should be interesting.
Love your vids but I feel I have to say that it supposed to top a constant flow and not a waves or tsunami in your case
The wall wasn’t tapered so wouldn’t speed up much anyways tbh
What if you reverse the valve?
You built it wrong!!! if you did it right no water would get through, there’s not supposed to be a straight way through, it goes from left to right to stop the water smh learn how to copy an image, not hard 😂
bro I bet there's at least one citizen licking the "tip" of the path🤣
Technically the water needs to meander in a tight Z shape pattern through J shaped valves forcing the water to not only double back on itself but quicker lose it's size and velocity.   For what tools you had to hand, I guess...it actually wasn't that bad of a simulation, and agreed it was a sort of decent success.
Too bad you actually didn't make a tesla valve.  Look it up.  The loops are arranged in a staggered pattern alternating sides.
...Только вот по схеме Тесла данные узлы расположены не парами, а поочередно + имеют определенный размер относительно трубы. Построив по схеме, у тебя повысится эффективность торможения банально из-за того, что просвета для потока воды будет меньше + сами узлы дадут больше обратной силы.  И да, привет из СНГ
10:28 keyword here is pressure, the wave actually slows down
Water physics looks goey in this gaùe
Imagine a Game exactly Like this But More Realistic, THE CAPABILITIES ARE INFINITE
Why does the design look so Sus
Geometry is first-class in tesla valves... Sorry but the "thing" you've built ain't no tesla valve. Try again...
Dear Engineer - your fluid dynamics suck... you created a diffraction experiment and narrowed the opening to 1/3 of the width. A narrow channel only speeds up the flow if there isn't an easier path.  Basically a Tesla valve divides the flow in 2 and reverses the direction of half the flow. Your first 2 semi lobes are basically doing all your work. - Stagger these and angle them and you'll get better flow cancellation. Sadly, not a Tesla valve.
You could offset them so the longer bits can come past the middle
Average boosie fade
I like your videos keep up the good work
Looks like an anatomical diagram…😳
Yes, is a penis. xD
what do you mean sort of? tesla invented the ac current we use every today(among a shit ton of other things). he should be remembered as a hero and should have lived a life of extreme luxury. instead tomas edison robbed him blind and killed a shit ton of animals to try and hide the fact that tesla's method was infinitely better. also elon musk is a giant douch and him naming his car company tesla is a slap in the face.
Did anyone notice the pp?
I’d love to see this in CS2 when it drops.
Need to offset your spouts
whats the tweeting noise?
You have my subscription for the simple fact that you chose the Tesla valve as the theme of this video
7:03 wtf :DDD Giant ejaculation.
10:48
5:24 love how he just made a you know would😂😂
asi funciona el cervix
That escalated quickly. lol
Thanks
18:09 for tsunami
That wasn't a tesla valve though..
5:24 why is it so daum long xD
The Tesla Valve reminds me of the way baffles in a suppressor work to reduce sound from a firearm.  It's still fluid dynamics but with air rather than water.  Cool.
i cant tell if you did that... umm... trouser snake on purpose or axidentally
This is not a tsunami, this is a rouge wave.
Son: Dad, what is puberty Father: Well son, 5:23
great work of enginering man 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Leave it to him to create the strongest shape perfectly!🤭🤫
lmao looking at all the valves I'm like "Oh my dad has made these parts before" and he used to take home defective pieces from the line and give them to me as trinkets and gifts. I loved cool metal shit.
Just block the entire tsunami ✋🌊
🤨
Water physics are definitely the weakest part of Cities Skylines.
It was literally painful to see how terribly you implemented it... IQ80
That's not a Tesla valve? Did you even look at a picture first? Dummy
19:00 Blender has some nice water simulations too
I love the educational part of this video! But maybe just because I'm in a field very close to engineering
The problem with this game's water physics is that the momentum of the fluid is constant when travelling parallel to the ground. Does anyone know of any game that has fluid physics that incorporates that?
The moment I saw what he did 😂😂😂 5:12
FfffffffffffffffffffffffffffYou🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😠😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
A solid wall/cliff would've worked better
A couple of points to note: Tesla valves aren't straight, they kink as they go along to force flow into one of the traps - you could model this by making one of the arms twice the length of the other and then alternating them; Also, Tesla valves are one-way - should be perfectly feasible for the river to drain through the Tesla valve even while it stops the tsunami.
5:25 sus
-_- wait a minute
What if engineers and architects work together to make it look cool and be structurally safe
"Today we're going to see if a tesla valve can stop a tsunami." _proceeds to not build a tesla valve_
5:23 wtf is the shape
What did Tesla ever do to you for you to mock and butcher one of his ideas
Wow, what a graceful dick joke 🤣😂🤣
but teslas don't have valves
There is no center path in an actual tesla valve.  An actual one probably would have worked
Well as I know a common tsunami is just flooding with nonstop coming water so theres nothing to absorb. And a mega wave tsunami is so huge weight and amount of water that any artificial structures will be as a joke.
The citizens of the City of Glans are saved!
This is no more than a sound suppressor for a gun. Long shift with baffles. Any idiot with a penis or genius with a penis could build or designed something more grand.   It's Obamaish.
NOT a Tesla Valve...
When she rubs her hand down your thigh... the water is the erection
Nobodys gonna talk about the image the barriers make? 😂
Title should have been can penis valve stop the flood from comming
"Babe, it's just structural, don't worry. Just the tip. We do this in engineering all the time.
LOL good luck, It would have to be IMMENSE in size and actually be at the point of contact - got a crystal ball?
The mistake you've made is that in a Tesla valve the channel should go directly into the valve, not be choked into it.
Even though you didn't make a real tesla valve (as noted by others, the flow is forced into either direction), it does look awfully similar to the inside of a firearm silencer/suppressor
5:25 It looks like a penis lol
Was it designed for large scale use like this? Because it seems very... wasteful of space and resources to try to do something like this. Also, isn't a valve meant to be able to be opened and closed? Or the flow be directed wherever you want? I mean, cheers to Tesla for having the idea, I guess, but there were already regular valves at the time he lived, which did their job took less space and were flexible in their use.
5:25 😂 I mean come on… is my mind forever in the gutter? Am I imagining things? 😅😅😅
least expensive and most safe solution = do NOT build anywhere near the sea 9min. 5 miles inland
you know, you would probably observe the change of velocity if you made it a 3d tunnel, not just sidewalls. And it only works for a continuous flow, not an "water impulse". Fairly wrong imho
this looks like the interior of a firearm suppressor with baffle stacks
@5:29, LOL!
At the start is a penis ahahahahahahahahaha
I new exactly what he was doing as soon as he curved the top part
For what games can be good. Interesting simulation
I would say... your Tesla valve isn't really like how it should be. the main channel goes a bit in a zig zag as the "valves" alternate each others. the very first one, the entrance of the loop is there, but the exit should align with the entrance of the opposite side one and vice versa. creating a snake pattern in the main channel. that pattern makes it that the water would mainly want to go into the valve, although with the game's water physics, it wouldn't change it that much
ID be really interested to see a real world experiment of this or a simulation in something a little bit more realistic
it's worth noting that the context here is different than the ideal case of a constant high velocity flow. The whole turning-back-on-itself bit is less effective in the short term since the water doesn't have time to loop back around and slow down whatever's part of the initial wave.
I have never seen a worse interptation of a tesla valve in my life. Back to the study room !
no one is going to mention the giant cock?
Hi 💕
What if the barrier walls can be made hollow (and cheaply) and made strong by filling them with water that is channeled inland as the water recedes from the shoreline just prior to a tsunami. Using the same hydrodynamic principle of pinching and elevating water, ducts would fill from the movement of the receding water and flow into the shoreline defense wall. This would use less land.
No because that's gonna take money out of my bottom line....
The Tesla valve doesnt have a direct pipe from start to finish. Its zig-zagged
Come on now fake engineer 51T30 here.    Do better the water would have crumbled the weak points with no movement.     DO BETTTER FAKE
Whats teslas nationality. Answer now🙂🙂🙂
i think the thing he missed with velocity is that it is not  a pipe with a set section and the water level can change this mean that when it get narrow instead of going faster the waves just go highter but with the same speed
That is not a Tesla valve! A tesla valve does not have a straight path down the middle. The sides are also staggered.
Sire, you can have my like for that amazing clickbait
I would have liked to see the tesla valve diverters placed along and outside of the side walls, thus retaining the original width of the channel.  I believe that would have been a better way of seeing the effect, and better represents the way that the valve is intended to work (by not restricting the width of the original channel)
While the speed of water flow will change if it is going through a nozzle or diffuser, the speed of the waveform will not.  This is because the water can simply go up, thus increasing the height of the wave.  If your channels were contained (had a lid or roof), then the water speed would change according to the cross sectional area of the channel.  But since there is no upper bound, the water just changes in depth instead.
It’s literally a suppressor… gasses and water flow similarly.
Tesla IS the man.  Edison was a thief.
would probably help if you followed the actual design of the valve it would be alternating and would probably have stopped the water by the second valve
No
What was the software called? not the Game.
Do you have eye problems? That doesn't look anything like a Tesla valve!
Not a proper Tesla valve, not bashing you or anything but in a Tesla valve the fluid is being scooped up from each side in alternating pattern and redirected back into the flow. it does not have dead ends that block the flow all together. But good try never the less :D
5:24 bruh...☠
I think you should compare it to the same width simply being spread out to that same width. I don't think this quite shows the effect you were looking for. Possibly the games physics not sure. But to me this doesn't seem to show it without accounting for the other effects you are having.
they killed him for safe tsunami
What software program is this? and where can i get it?
a tesla valve is not symetrical for a reason that you didnt got.
Tesla Patent 1,329,559 "Valvular Conduit" means that the noun is conduit while the adjective is valvular. Proper specification would be "Tesla Conduit." The patent specifies that the device employs both expansion and contraction together with redirection to destructively interfere with the propagation of wave impulses in one direction. Key attributes include at least 10 degree alternating deviations in the main channel flow path which direct the main flow into a bucket thrust reverser on the opposite side of the channel.  This necessitates that the repeating walls are offset along the channel by one full stage length. The video simulation shows them opposite each other. Properly constructed the Tesla anti-tsunami channel would not allow a view of the city from the beach. Additionally, the Tesla conduit has a top plate which would prevent any overtopping.  IMO Tesla designed the conduit for fluid flow in opposite directions. It's not clear why simple flood walls would not suffice. If the intent was to limit tsunami penetration up a river, then that would make sense.
If suggest doing a coned entrance to increase the velocity before any valves
Hey, you should LOOK VICTOR SCHAUBERGER, understanding nature . Curve it and let it reflow in diffrent direkton, + stones.
how can you call yourself an engineer on any level?
so funny  Can a Tesla Valve stop a MEGA TSUNAMI in Cities Skylines?
Do 3 parallel walls with a few slots cut out of them where the waves destructively interfere. The walls won't need to be tall enough to contain the wave completely
Is that toaster Paul Hibbert?
(👁👃👁)
This is not what a Tesla valve looks like and cannot function as a Tesla valve.
it would have only took you 1 minute to look up how a tesla valve looks like. youtube these days, full of trash information
good ol Tesla.
you dont understand why this work
16:43
for that valve u need something that can keep up with the outside and innerside pressure at small scale can work but at big scale remains to be seen
idk shit about engineering or tesla or valves and yet im here and this is quite pleasing to watch dfiosakfopsakfsaopkdas ty
Well the velocity will only increase if it's the same amount of water that's going into a narrower section. If it's a fraction of the water that's being split from the main branch, it'll just carry on at the same speed.
Are u all seeing this?😂 5:26
Some people shave their bracing pears
build a full wall
the first valve shoud use the water on the left and right to make the first risistance instead ob a dead end
Not a Tesla valve
This is really just a, does cities skylines crude facsimile of macro physics line up with actual physics via mechanical principles. Way more entertaining than it has any right being
Not only is the valve made improperly, it isn’t designed to completely stop a fluid or gas. It merely slows it down substantially.
When you unintentionally design a firearm silencer
This works for all the wrong reasons
Oh... and I always thought Vavle would be resposible for Half Life 3.
Вообще-то, если попробовать изучить как работает клапан Тесла, можно легко понять что он работает с ламинарными потоками, и не работает с импульсами. Поэтому и не обязан влиять на волны
why live on the water if that's your view though o.o
Isn't this essentially how a gun suppressor works?
Now delete this video, try to make an actual tesla valve in that game... and then repost.
Dude this is awesome!  Here's what I'd love to see [my potato computer cant run these sims ;'(. ]. a channel as thick as just that central portion at 17:59 but smooth with no tesla valves and/or just equivalent regular outlet channels along it. I'm curious if the reduction in damage is the result of the valves, or if its just (in cities skylines) distance + outlet that = wave reduction.   Example:   B二二===||==||==||==二二D vs B二二========二二二二D   instead of   B二二⥢⥢⥢⥢二二二二D vs B二二二二二二二二二D   (the first diagram those are outlet valves not walls btw)
can you do this again but actually make the tesla valve and not a rendition of it.
How do you invent electricity? …
Did you just make a firearm suppressor but for water
Wth was that device over the guy's mouth in the opening?
5:25 yo 😭🤣🤣
ATF: 🤔
That video did not need to be as long as it was.
The part where yo y we’re reinforcing the corner with a spherical wall then adding the lines I was like “hmm interesting” then you zoomed out and I realized I got got 😂
My man skipped hydromechanic
Okay but can it protect your city from Titans?
A single small wall along the road will be enough to stop the leftover water... maybe.
Pretty awesome physics on that water. Not perfect but nice. RDR2 has some great water physics on PC if you crank it to max setting.
The inside pegs need to be longer then the front ones ☹
that wall looks kinda sus ngl
Would the refracting waves cancel out the second and third waves of the tsunami ?
Try it again, but using an actual Tesla valve layout
Like the effort. Plenty of kinks, though.
@17:42  I don’t care about a wave coming in right now , we have a deadline to put up this building peeps
You just wanted to draw a man's organ, didn't you? :D
i a pipe water gets faster, if the pipe is smaller, but if there is no vertical restraint, it could also go higher
calls himself a engineer yet cannot even follow a simple diagram. defeats the purpose and debunks his own "qualification"
I don't understand why the water should change its speed? - This is not a pipe system with a fixed cross-sectional area. If the path gets wider the water level simply decreases; there is no need for the speed to decrease.
Open channel flow is very different from closed channel flow. An open channel like this shouldn't really constitute a valve.
This is how a suppressor on a gun works too :)
Thank you for spreading knowledge of this man! He was amazing, as are you pal!
i think the channel  is offset in each row on the Tesla valve so its not a straight shot down the middle is you look it zigzags
Sort of? Huh
Just clicked, better hear country roads while the flood ravages the people!
The best way to control the ocean is to manipulate the moon. If you can't do that yet, just live inland.
5:27. What did he just do😜
You did even build a tesla valve
gate valves have high failure rates in home settings. ball valves 4 lyfe.
Kinda missed on the design but that should show just how much his would have worked
I'm sory to say that, but you didn't get behind the idea of the teslavalve at all. What you've builded works but isn't the valve.
as much as I admire the dedication, C:S is a game with fluid simulation so rudimentary that I absolutely detest playing on any maps with running water. You can suck a river dry with just a few pumps or create flooding with sewage outlets placed too close to each other. The tsunamis are doing their job as far as catastrophes go, but they are definitely not there for wannabe amateur physicists to experiment with. :P
i watched the whole video waiting for him to put a slit in the top of the shaft, as added drainage for the tsunami........but he didnt, an now im dissapointed
like srsly its okay to misstake a single wave with the expectation of it beeing slowed down by any means you need a constant input and not a single spike, therefore i call for a complete remake!
You drew a giant penis with balls, dude. Bold.
so what about the roof of the valve?
Lovely city you were errecting there
I thought a Tesla valve required a closed tube, whereas your surface path doesn't have an enclosed roof. The speed of the water would probably work as you specified if this was a closed tunnel instead of an open path with no roof.
it's not a true Tesla valve, look up a picture and redo
The video would be nice if the simulation would be more accurate but like that it’s pretty boring tbh
pretty cocky making a joke like that
Your bracing piers definitely deserved my like
Great video! Unfortunately this doesn’t show how the design is superior to other methods. For instance what if you simply put the same amount of obstacles within the canal (like horizontal walls), as comparison. In other words your experiment lacks a control group.
tesla valve 10% bullshiting 90%
cool, but that is not a true tesla valve. there should not be an unobstructed path directly to the city, the baffles should overlap. still cool tho. you should also prove its effectiveness by flowing in the opposite direction.
You never really created a tesla valve though, your center path didn't zig zag to direct the flow into the reverse paths and gave it a strait path through.  Also, it would be many times more effective if you staggered reverse valve along that path, you have the picture of one but didn't truly  make one.
IF you just hit 0 over and over he says the n word ehehhehe
oh i learned alright, i learned how big of a dick and balls you can draw in city skylines lolol
18:13 You said the water will be forced to move faster through the narrow gaps compared to the wider gaps, but the water appears to be moving at the same speed through both of them.
you could rebuild 100 cities for what it would take to make walls around even one coastal city >:/
Such a RICH environment
I wouldve liked to ahave seen you alternate them down the alley way, and extend their length further across the alley way to about 55-75%.
Very nice 🤔 but does  it havet to look like a giant rooster 🐓or a 🤔 🥒🍆🥖🍄🌡️🙃🧐
Was it really necessary to create those circles at the base of the shaft and an opening at the tip?  Kind of ballsy design.
The problem with trying to use a Tesla Valve against a Tsunami is that a tsunami's problematic part is the initial wave which will make it through the center of the valve because there's no push back from the sides.
This looks very similar to the baffle system inside a firearm silencer.
this whole time i can't but think this is kinda pointless or won't prove anything because there just simply no way a game like city skylines would put incredibly realistic water dynamics for the off chance your dealing with a tsunami hitting your city in a game that generally is about city building, not water physics. Would be cool to see you do this in an actual program that simulates actual water phyics instead. But I guess you at least learn how water works in the video game, not real life. I think only reason it worked is not because of  the telsa valve but because each time it squeezes past a tiny section it expands again and lowers in height so for city sky lines all you would have had to do is make a row of like 10 narrow points for water to pass through and watch wave spread out past each narrow hole reducing in height each time, because all the other effects of water speeding up/slowing down and coming back on itself clearly had no actual effect here.
I think you didnt understand the tesla Valve correctly. just take a nearer look at the constuction plan and build it again. you will see way more efficiency. but nice vid
Sorry to burst your bubble. I'm an engineering scientist in the field of electrical engineering...no, Tesla did not invent or innovate ANYTHING relevant in terms of electricity or electric transmission. That is an urban legend and a myth. Tesla is widely irrelevant in the history of electrical engineering. The people to thank for being able to watch this video are Werner von Siemens and Michail Doliwo-Dobrowolski.
Aren’t the tesla valves offset? And wouldn’t that help with what is trying to be achieved regarding the original design? The design on the simulator isn’t what was shown in the tesla valve graphic - which may have more effect in stopping the tsunami.
@5.24 :p
Thats btw the design of a silencer
Not quite a tesla valve.
14:40 Traffic is most realistic in the simulation
I was watching that  thinking "oh yea thats cool, suport for 90° corners with pillers and I guess a round city is something you can do... oohhhh"
That wasn't a Tesla Valve. You can't draw a straight line through a propper Tesla Valve.
5:27 am I the only one seeing this? 😅
I'm in awe of the poor programmer who had to write a tidal wave simulation algorithm for this game. Hahahahaha. I bet that was some overtime.
Judge not from appearances.
"not only was his name the inspiration for one of the fastest growing car manuifacturers ever"   .......  just had a to find a way to make a video that had nothing to do with the car company mention the car company......
16:42 You're welcome
NOT A TESLA VALVE, ONLY LOOKS LIKE ONE
That isn't a telsa valve. Not even going to watch the video cause the premise is wrong.
You essentially made a firearm suppressor without realizing it
And to think Nicola tesla didn't even have cities skylines.
the velocity isn’t affected because there isn’t a top on your tesla valve, which allows the water to get higher instead of forcing it to speed up.
rocket science XD
i think you can do a wide version by cascading shapes similar to the nike logo alternating it's direction each row, and maybe half as high just for fun. but i think you'll need a good cpu and gpu to pull it off
Got a dislike for being ignorant of what is a real Tesla Valve Civil Engineer my A$$ :D
What your should have done is same thing next to the tesla valve, is just put up 90 degree walls with the same size pathway in the middle. Because I'm convinced its not doing anything besides making the tsunami smaller because you have giant walls to slow it all down...
Instead of the wall with one valve channel put a series of the valves along the coast.
For structural support I'm going to add two fuzzy orbs to this long cylindrical structure... for support.
Son...Is there some reason your valve looks like a giant penis with hairy balls? LOL
sry i dont have engineering school but i think entering walls where water need to make a circle should be more wide on entrance to speed up water and make it hit middle wave faster before middle wave pass the exit point ?
hate to say it dude but you FAILED sooo hard on using the valve right lol
Really needed to level the floor with the sea floor.
In summary, NO. IT DIDNT WORKED.
lol... "i guess we can call this the tip"
I don't think the maker is right that the speed should change because this "tesla valve" is not capped in the 3rd dimension (height). The reason the 2 d tesla valves increase speed in narrower channels  is because there is no third dimension for the water to stack up. 2d dynamics do not = 3d dynamics . The reason the 2d diagrams work is because each layer stacking in the 3rd dimension is assumed to be exactly equal to the other layers. The fact that there are height differences in a tsunami wave invalidates the 2d treatment.
Except... this is not a Tesla valve. At least do some basic research before making a video. You sure you are a real engineer?
For incompressible fluids velocity is proportional to cross sectional area. The wave doesn't go faster bc it's not constrained in the vertical dimension, so it deforms and gets taller and the cross sectional area stays the same. You'd need a pipe or something for the cross sectional area to get smaller
You know what your construction looks like...?
No idea why you've made a symmetrical design with a clear path right through the middle, that isn't what a Tesla valve is at all.
Your eyes must be fucked because that was not even close to a tesla valve.
Tesla autos is NOT one of the fastest growing car companies.  It is, however, one of the most over valued, and consequently, financially vulnerable, car manufacturers around, that's for sure.
OMG you actually managed to incorrectly replicate the valve!!  There should *not* be a "clear sight" between the inlet and the outlet.  You didn't make a valve, you instead made the equivalent of a resistor
..except that this thing, while being successfully penis-shaped, is NOT a Tesla valve.  A Tesla valve doesn't have a straight unobstructed flow channel down the center.
In order to wrok, you need to make each step asymmetric. The one that takes the straight path must expand so that it travels more slowly, while the one that takes the bendy path must contract so it speeds up and makes it to the crossing point at roughly the same time
I'd like to see this but use suppressor baffle designs
why do you leave in the middle nothing. Pu these valves more right then left and right etc.
hehe peepee
From my limited understanding of tesla valves it seems like a tsunami is the wrong way to look at them. I think they work better along a pipe of constantly flowing water as this allows the swirls to cancel properly. Whereas in a tsunami the initial front of water is always going to be ahead of the water thats taking the longer circular path
Tesla valve in title. Talks about tesla valve throughout the entire video. Makes something else. Didnt bother watching the whole video but i guess he explains why?
teslar valve is left right not like you did both sides ... its actualy with a off set .... why make a fake tesla valve ?
This isn't a tesla valve ffs 🤣🙄
That is not Tesla valve.
where do you live?  i would not want to use anything you've made
I'm sorry but that's not Tesla Valve
I'm going to test a Tesla valve!  *proceeds to not make the required shape for 14 minutes, then still makes it a different shape *  Yep, this is a YouTube video.
so a critical part of a tesla valve is that there is no straight line path through the valve. to make it properly, the 2 sides should be staggered, so the freestanding walls are opposite a wall connected to the outside of the valve, and the freestanding walls should cross slightly past the center of the valve.
7:57 what is wrong with this engineer please just stop with these “jokes”.
11:01 this one that's what?!?!?🤨
Stop calling it a Tesla valve!
For those who only want to watch the result, here it is 17:52
I like how he’s like let’s game it out but he makes it mor educational and less chaotic
Clearly the water's simulated viscosity is wrong
Love the attempt for sure, but the valve was constructed incorrectly. A real valve doesn't have a wide open spac ein the center.
Are there open source water physics simulators?  Seems like the perfect open source project.  You get much more value by paying developers instead of those massive license fees.  Would get a ton of academic contributions too, since a good fluid simulator would be an invaluable research tool.
This is NOT a tesla valve, literally zero thought went into replicating the design of the actual tesla valve.
Yep you're a civil engineer for sure.  Calling things Tesla Valves that aren't even close to what you were trying to imitate. Coming from a Machinist, you're about as helpful as Human Resources
Can confirm, "hrs to run simulations." Literally running an SPS hydraulic model right now.
You built it more like the baffles in a suppressor rather than an actual tesla valve
17:10 i believe the water flows the same because of the heightened flood walls. I think the game doesnt recognize the walls underneath the flood walls as walls. Could be wrong tho
next video: Can a Tesla Valve stop me from committing *VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER* in Croatia?
Lol! Structurally-sound... Phallus? ;)
Your Tesla valve isn't a Tesla valve. It's more like a suppressor. Tesla valves don't allow direct flow through backward. The flow is forced side to side.
You made a rifle suppressor.
I'm just saying, if I was civil engineer, I'd totally make giant penis shaped infrastructure on purpose.
I subscribed @2:48
The fact I didn’t catch you making the shape with those “bracings” on the wall until you did the overhead view I lost it lmao
Bro I love the design 10/10 I died when I noticed what it was😂😂😂😂
This is not Tesla Valve. This is just how suppressors and mufflers work. Bad Clickbait
Your valve is wrong... if you look closely at the tesla valve, you will notice there is no straight channel all the way through. First water is directed to the left, then to the right. It has to zig-zag through. It doesn't go straight. Too bad the water doesn't do what it's supposed to do.
Anyone want to tell him he didn't actually make a proper Tesla Valve? The real design would have done much better.
contributor to the invention of electricity?! how about inventor off the induction motor!!!
You didn't make a tesla valve though lol. You showed us what one looked like and then didn't make it correctly
Okay... So it's actually simulating light..? Constant speed wave, can't slow down or speed up, and it looks like it could accurately do two-slit type experiment...
build a proper tesla valve
The water simulation is actually based on a thesis/paper written by either a friend or a professor of one of the programmers.
🤣🤣🤣🤣, next level dick jokes!! You're awesome dude!
I don't think the valve actually worked the way it should.  I think what happened was every part of the valve merely took some water away from the wave.  Then when the wave exited the valve, it spread out again to cover the available space, but with less water than it had before.
That city got the shaft
Because the game treats the water as a wall I’m sure the easiest way is to put the walls gradually closer together to leave less space for the water to go through
That is NOT a tesla valve. You had a picture of one in the beginning but what you made is not that. You would have more interesting and and unintuitive results if you made a real tesla valve. Dont skimp on details. Spend a few more days on your videos. You seem like you put little energy in your content. Youre channel is right in the middle of good engineering and intellectual content, and screaming teenagers who play minecraft on twitch. Idk dude. Not trying to be rude just "commenting"
5:24 do u see it?
IM goona ignore the shape
Who needs fluent when you have  Cities Skylines?
5:24 looks sus
Some comments below mentioned off-setting the side channels to enhance the effect, but on top of that I think you should also make each side extend a little more into the center channel. I'd be interested to see how much of an impact these two adjustments would make in this game. Also I was sure you were going to build it on the existing river to show how it handles directional flow.
5:35 hold up
5:24 BIG PP
When it takes a big prick to get the job done 😂
Came to see a Tesla valve and didn't see one at all, for shame. Look at the diagram and copy it properly next time.
5:24 pp
5:24 SUS
5:30 and 7:38 why
It works here mostly by cutting a wave up. A wave becomes wider => cut in half => wider again.
I would have liked to see how it would have stopped the water if you had made a Tesla valve.
Excuse me, but this is not a Tesla valve that you created. There is no straight line through and no chambers on the opposite side, it should be a zigzag for any fluid.
Tsunami Supressor 5000
Just make a wall
Why does it start out looking like a wang?
4 minutes In still babbling , and plugging his store with bootleg shit , thumbs down , don’t recommend channel again
it really baffles me that nations with major cities on coastlines arent building these types of sea walls to protect against rising sea level, huge international projects that would involve multiple countries and help diplomacy between nations. I also wonder if we could engineer underground resevoirs which would direct sea water underground
The Telsa dong
Makes me think of the inside of some silencers.
As soon as he started rounding that “support” I knew what the fuck was up 😂
"So if you have a series of these along your shaft..." Then you might need to see a doctor.  That impatient traffic is pretty realistic... Ever seen how many peoole drive through rushing floodwaters?
cities skylines has bad water ...
The the f#@*
Waterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*******rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
city is die rip city 😭
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rce likes funny things
Rce likes
Bad testa value
Bro I think my heart skipped a beat silently when you zoomed out of the finished landscaping 💀
You should have staggered them like they are in Tesla’s valve diagram!
The tip
the fluid mechanics at 16:00 arent right, the channel becomes narrower, but the pressure doesnt increase because youre also reducing the mass flow rate entering the channel, so the velocity would stay constant
I don't know how I never see the knob coming..
you kindof ignored the tesla valve and just made a bunch of triangles that had no effect on the central flow you needed to offset each of them so there was no flow that goes straight down the center
Yes we will call it the tip 🤣🤣🤣😅
That structure kinda funny😂😂😂😂
I love how you build complex tsunami prevention system that would have been done by building 2 high walls at the shore. I would have build that tesla valve where the river is.
I think the issue here is that the fluid mechanics you mention work when the channel is pressurized, but because this is an open channel, the waves won't speed up as flow rate of the channel is still the same (the waves increased in height). And while the Tesla valve worked, I think it's not because of the principles of mentioned. The water backflowed into the ocean, which wouldn't be if the channel was pressurized. Personally, I think it was just because there was far less water that came out of it.  But this was an interesting experiment indeed. Mildly satisfying to watch.
Imagining the guy on the dev team who’s whole job was water physics watching this video. You probably made his day!
Your geometry is simply wrong, the Tesla valve wiggles from side to side and this is essential to its function.  Its also designed for bulk fluid flow, not gravity wave propagation.  The geometry details are everything in this kind of device, just as in a turbine blade.
Very unnecessary. Just use a normal wall.
I think a Tesla valve only really work once the water is flowing, so it won’t do it’s thing with the first wave, but if there’s a lot of water steadily flowing in from the sea, as happens in hurricanes, it’ll help more I think .
Ok, what's with the wall design?
You realize you just created a silencer?
So you're just not going to build it?
City skylines needs to make there water flow more realistically, at the moment it’s more like jelly
So ... Really just a big c...k and balls.  🤣🤣
That aint no fucking Tesla valve up in this bitch
😏
Nice try.
This video is enough proof of him being an engineer   Is the contraption finished? Yes!  Does it do everything as we intended? No.. Does it get the job done? Yes! Amazing!
you would need a constant push of water, like out of a faucet to work with this at all. a tsunami is essentially a one time pulse, which has way more space infront anf behind the wave for error
Doesn't a tsunami draw its power/height by pulling in the water ahead of it? If that's true, what would happen if you constructed your flood walls out on the ocean floor tall enough to prevent a substantial volume of water from flowing out towards the base of the tsunami?
How do you get this tsunami
Chemical engineer here. Nahhhhhhhhhhhh
You can slowly compress the wave to make it higher in the middle and to make it spill over less.
You have to test this in dwarf fortress... I bet its got the best water of them all.
In what way is the backflow having any effect on the initial wave that keeps on going? It only opposes water rushing in after the tsunami. Really, this needs continuous flow of water rushing in to have an effect, not a single big wave, right? I'm no engineer, but I don't the mechanism this valve relies on adds anything at all in this case.
great thanks to the editor of the day; vury nice visualization of water :P
Your valve is missing a key feature of actual Tesla valves, namely you can’t just look down the middle of one
Why the tsunami wave should have slow down? A wave is a wave. Exactly like a sound, a radio wave or a light wave. Putting walls in their way isn't going to change the color, the sound or the radio station.
I don't think your statement "the wider the water, the slower it is" is not necessarily true. If a wide channel is funnelled down to a narrow channel then I think it would be true, but in this case the effective depth and wave amplitude would increase. It is also true that to get the same amount of fluid through a narrow channel compared to a wide one, flow must be faster. Of course all this assumes constant depth and depths differences will change the flow speed. If your statement was true, then the wave speed over the sea would be much slower than down your channel.
Nikola Tesla made the first hydroelectricity plant, it’s located at Niagara Falls. He got inspiration for it when he was a kid and invented a “water wheel” little did he know he had made an invention way ahead of his time
Big wave
One thing is that I don't think the intuition for fluid in a pipe (with no air) is applicable to fluid with a free surface. On the simplest level, continuity equations don't work the same because height can change freely, so you don't have the same flow vs cross-section relation.
Just had flash backs left for dead game iykyk
Anyone else with a dirty mind and thinking stuff you should not be thinking In something like this 😅
5:30 sussy?
😂💣💥💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
5:33 you know what you did
The thing why city skylines is doing right is bec theres not any top
Physics of the game is right. The speed would be faster in a closed pipe. Some of the energy became kinectic and some became potential.
5:25 pp
He was just drawing a dixk
The Venturi effect is more important and ubiquitous than I would have thought
Cities skylines updated announcement: water physics
Kya tumhe bhi vahi dikha bade map me jo mujhe dikha 🤣
Nice, but .. bad model of valve, it is more like zig-zag line in original ...
8:54 funny shape
"wouldn't happen in real life" Is a bold statement considering this experiment has never been done to this scale, when you get to this size, a LOT of things change.
When dealing with water in extremely large quantities, the "flow" is actually just being powered by water cycling under and over, in other words, it speeding up wouldn't happen, it would provide more force then immediately dissipate, much like what you saw, because the force provided by the water behind it is weakened.
This is how rocket engines work except when you squeeze the exhaust too much it stops going faster, thats why the bell nozzle exists, as the exhaust spreads it gets faster only if the narrowest point on the bell is properly optimized. Neat rocket science for ya
The exit/ entrances of one valves should be staggered, right?
Is it only me or did the thing start as a diagram of a dick
I'm now on the edge of my seat when I see MEGA TSUNAMI
I don't understand, why would you think that a Tesla Valve would work with waves of energy? Wasn't it designed to work with pressure?
So, I hate to say it, but you didn't understand the assignment. If it was a true tesla valve, were you looking from the sea toward the city, you would not be able to see the city at all. The most efficient track the water could follow toward the city would be a zig-zag not a straight line, and the tributaries are designed to create an opposing force to that flow. Your design, while it worked some by chipping away at the waves flanks and reducing the volume in the center, does not redirect water back the other way until well after the main flow has passed already.
5:24 think of the shape
SELFIE TOASTERS!!! I worked for the selfie toaster people!!! I used to grind faces!
Nice vid
I think a Tesla Valve works best with a continuous flow, not so well with a pulse when the back flow comes too late to hit against the main wave.
5:24 As a fellow engineer, I, too, have used this design.  It's very robust
"I'm an engineer" Proceeds to build worlds biggest cock and balls

Can everybody stop making those discusting f***ing thingi!!!!!!!  (Sory for my axent im from philipines and like speaking english)
He's sus
Nobody actually saw what  drew at the end
Looks like a Man's Privates @5:24
Long story short. Kinda
Why must you?
That was not even close to a Tesla Valve.
I did know he dabbled in fluid mechanics. He did make the first hydroelectric dam at Niagara Falls after all.
*YOU AREN'T MAKING A TESLA VALVE AT ALL! WTF?!*
it's a penis valve.
Could this create a reverse tsunami?
You want the two sides off set a bit, not parallel
Wow... a genius... look at our veins and arteries... how do they prevent backflow?
What if you funnel all the water to the center and build an actual tesla valve design? You know off set loops with the center channel being fully directed down one side at a time.
Not at all the shape of a tesla valve....
5:30 My serious not a child brain was giggling for a minute here.
How to waste 19:47 seconds of your life...
It should be illegal for Musk to use Teslas name when he(Elon) can't even invent anything
7:55 what do you see?
nvm 5:25 pause it and what do you see
5:30 pause it and what do you see?
I think the main problem of this one is the fact that it's just too cramped. There should be that 180 degree turn. The whole point of Tesla valve is that you redirect waterflow without basically loosing the flow speed (well, as much as you can) and that redirected flow fighting the main flow slowing it down. I guess you understand it now judging by a small preview I see on the right of this commen.t
He makes all the tiny details (like the bottom of the tesla valve) look like a d*** and i find that funny 🤔
10:00 Hydraulics wasn't my favorite subject in uni, and I barely remember things even though working with hydraulics at work, but bare logic says that when you make a jet nozzle-ish structure in your channel it only speeds up inside the said nozzle (without counting the friction and stuff) so after exiting it it would slow down proportionally to the difference between nozzle tip and channel width. With a shit ton of turbulence on the sides because it has two dead zones on the sides. I forgot how this law is called.
Just casually build wall Maria XD
Nobody noticed the giant dik?😅😂😂😂
Oof.  That ratio.  Maybe try again and make an actual Tesla valve.
they travel to Cape Canaveral to watch
This isn't a Tesla Valve at all.  Lol.
“iTs NoT a TeSlA vAlVe”
what's you PC specs? i want to do this too
Instanly going to comment section after 5:23
This isn't a Tesla Valve. You can't leave a STRAIGHT central channel and call it a Tesla Valve! But considering that, the Cities Skylines is not best fluid mechanics simulator then I can forgive You this simplification.
TESLA DICK
The speed should change if the flow is uniform. But u are dealing with a single wave front, so it doesn't change
I love these videos but I was waiting so long for you to actually build the tesla valve and you never did :/
I also took some Hydraulics classes in college.  It's the Conservation of Matter equation that typically yields the increase in a fluid's velocity as it goes through an orifice. Namely, Q=v*A, where Q is the flow, v is the velocity of the fluid, and A is the cross section of fluid at any point of the flow line. If you have fluid flowing through a rigid container, like a pipe, shrinking the diameter will shrink the A, forcing an increase in v to preserve the same Q. However, in this example, A=w*h, where w is the width of the channel, and h is the height of the fluid. When you shrink or increase the width of the channel, you're not changing A, you're changing w. A proportional change in h (the height of the wave) leaves A the same, which also leaves v and Q the same, leading to the wave through the channel maintaining the same speed as wave in the parallel river.
Tesla valve is not about waves. If you wanted to suppress waves there are cheaper and simpler means to make tsunami bounce off the walls of the canyon and suppress itself. Too bad it'll take a while longer than 5 minute Google search.
A civil engineer, ey? You ever read that manhwa about the Real Estate Developer?
Bro mad sus
Like a suppressors baffles
The invention of electricity? Ok bud whatever you say.
If the water traps would have been off set none would have gotten through. A tesla valve doesn't have one straight hole its staggered slightly to not allow gas or water to flood straight through.
Love this
Fluid mechanics is somewhat analagous to electricity. Although not a perfect analog. Its similar enough that expertise in one area can intersect with the other. It just requires a bit of translation.  For example. A narrow channel is analogous to a resistor. A capacitor is like some kind of pressure buffer.... elastic in its  effect... similar to a balloon. Something that can store pressure and release it when the pressure drops. But its weird to explain. Transistors are like valves which can open and close. (Although tesla would not have known about transistors.) The same concepts typically apply to both fields. Etc etc.
Tesla had a romantic attachment to a crow.  Which is super fucking based.  Get rekt society.
That does not look like an accurate representation of a Tesla One Way valve
this video is great on showing how tesla is the best. just imagine if you stagger them ever so slightly
Love the design 😅🤣😂
This whole thing was just too long to see the Tesla valve work on a tsunami only to see that the games engine is lacking in any realistic water physics so the whole experiment is moot at best, now I'm going to have to search youtube for a actual test of the principles of such cause this didn't help at all.
What's coming up the shaft is a reduced tsunami. A technical term could be seasurge minimalization, or sea-min for short.
Why didnt you build an actual Tesla valve like in the diagram?
7:00 ayo
Would be even more effective if you followed the original design and didn't align the openings of each consecutive valve.
hahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
this video could've been 2 minutes long
Water not speed up because crossection is what means, when you make channel narrower, crosse tion stay constant by changing height.
at 5:24 was it just me who spotted that shape or sombody else?
7:50 nothing of value was lost.
That's not a Tesla valve dude
That wall after adding the thing to absorb the impact kinda sus
if 9:50 is the cross section of an enclose pipe ,  the water go faster, haha, in the above case it actually slow it down
A short of it would've been better
"Bracing Piers" huh? LOL!
It’s w0rkinggggggggg
5:29 it do be looking sus
The only thing I learned is that kidney stones were made by Tesla
So painful to watch, the original Tesla valve was asymmetrical and also didn't allow directly looking through it without some bends
Ayoo 5:24
Subtle testicle joke nice
8:30 that is not how hydrodynamic motion works, it would need nowhere to go in order to speed up, in other words instead of a canal a tube, as the area it can take up decreases but volume stays the same, it would increase the pressure, the way you made that and the in game reaction are about right, in other words your understanding of hydrodynamics was incorrect, not the game physics engine.
1:08 bro you real engineer? 5:26 ayo. *rock eyebrow raise*
thank you chris fix 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
thats.. not a Tesla valve
Bruh made the 🅱️enis 💀
Is this rage bait? Why did you just make this from memory? That's not a tesla valve, that's shit. Would have been so easy to google the topic of your video and just copy an image, but no, you had to go about this in the most lazy way possible. This video is piss.
ribbed for our enjoyment
Why didn't you stagger the off channels like in the diagram?
Sooooo.... awesome demo, and it totally works, but this isn't actually a Tesla flute. It's shaped like one, but Tesla flutes work by redirecting pressure back at itself. If you send two waves at each other, they'll pass through each other with minimal interference. This works because it spreads out the force of the wave across a wider area. Each of your barriers will spread the force of the wave out by roughly half, and the last one reduces it to a third.  Fun video, though.
I'm disapointed. Not actual Tesla valve :-(
Your valve is a bit wrong. It shouldn't have a straight open line.
look like pepe
Instead of a whole tesla valve, try just putting 'notches' in the sides of the canal.  I've seen them used on long harbor entrance, the sudden widening/ narrowing as the waves pass the notches does a lot to dissipate the energy.
This guy explaining tesla vale with resonability but in a game with out water physics
You could reduce the volume in the shaft and simultaneously reduce spillage at the valve points by building a channel toward those nuts.  Then just add a lock mechanism to reduce the blue ball effect.  The city would receive way less jizz to the level of an incel's lovelife!
@5:25 & @7:39 Very cute, Sir. Very well played indeed 🤣🤣🤣
If the game isn't educational then you simply aren't playing it hard enough.
You pasted fig of Tesla valve and made something different...
Real Civil Engineer... you don;t know a bit about physics or fluid dynamics, you just read some internet pages and watched some videos. And now, you don't know, what's going on... it's always so funny to watch guys, who were average in Math in high school :D  Waves always travel the same speed, no matter what is the shape of your container. You are talking about fluid dynamics in what situation exactly??? "Fluid in a constrained channel"! Your "channel" is not constrained in the vertical axis, and you don't have a constant pressure gradient generation, you only have a single wave. Instead you could have tried the double slit experiment.
Save your time guys - start from 16:30
In 20 years anything called things like Tesla-coil or Tesla-valve will be thought to have been invented by Elon Musk, when Elon Musk didnt even invent Tesla cars.
Tesla valve?? Or zones to cummulative water volume
2 things i think made this unwork,  first, a tesla valve have a limited section, so the fluid can not escape by going "higher" if they're someting on his road t secondly, the tesla valve work for a flow not a wave
This is not even a tesla valve. Google what it looks like. This guy made something that is nothing like a tesla valve
17:38 Venice gameplay
9:34 if you saw it you're as mentally disturbed as I am
Sry, but this is not a Tesla Valve...
By the look of it, this design would benefit from making the central gaps progressively narrower.
You didnt do a tesla valve, the tesla valve does not have a gap in the middle, its all angling and diversions.
I mean it is not even a real tesla valve lol
Just move the people in the city to somewhere else 😂
You constructed the tessla valve wrong. Each loop is not oposite each other as you build them, they are varying from left to right to force the fluid to move in to new loops. Teslas valve doesnt have a straight open line down the middle.
Thank you. I will keep this in mind next time i build a very important multi million dollar city that will constantly be bombarded by tsunamis
Why not build city a little bit away from the coast?? What's the point of staying at a coast and try to stop tsunami.??
Love how you're obsessed with dicks. I am too 😏
*Listen closely on the first thing he says, " Mikola Tesla "* Yup he said *M*
5:23 You guys all realize what he just made at that moment... Right?
At 15:06, couldn't you just close the edge of the middle one, so it has to travel down the outside ones, round the curve, *then* back into the middle?
What I have learnt from a couple of episodes; Engineers loves Penises...
Building a non tesla valve in a game with pretty shitty water physics 😁
Would have been nice to have a second empty canal with no wall to compare the height of the tsumani
Just build a concrete wall in 100 km tall and 5  km thick..it maybe can withstand mega tsunami or super mega tsunami👍
Peace, love, and tesla valves!
What an awesome experiment- i went to school with his great great great great grandchild - gotta share it with him 🥳
I think Tesla's valve works in the continous flow limit
Game physics aren't wrong you're wrong
Can't apply flow principle to wave, the water only slows down if there's shit in front of it otherwise it'll just propagate forward like a wave
5:24 Nice
We would have had free electricity and internet with what he built but the government shut him down
Great experiment! And great effort as well, ty for the video! Also want to point out maybe tesla valves are more effective against a constant flow of water rather than an impulse ( or vice versa, idk actually) that would be a good addition to this experiment, maybe a short video?
5:24 IS PRETTY SUS
Am I the only one that thinks he drew a huge dickshaped contraption, and passed it off as engineering? (sorry didn't watch all the way through, maybe that's the point?)
Way to down play Teslas contributions
5:26 🤨
It would have been cool if he'd built a tesla valve
that's not the tesla valve
This reminds me of the construction of a firearm supressor a bit
Peeeeeniiiiissss
A tsunami stopping ding-dong. Congratz!
5:24 🤨📸
you make learning fun
7:38 com on
AI traffic? Or Florida traffic?
Very similar to the designs of firearm suppressor baffles.
@5:24 I think that’s pretty sus…
Lol schoolboy humour cut to 5:23
You did not create a Tesla valve in this simulation, you merely set up resistance walls. The same result could have been achieved using spaced out breaker walls on alternating sides. The unique dynamic of a Tesla valve is that the water feedback loop slows the overall flow rate. Admittingly, it's difficult to imagine how that would have any effect on a single wave that has already passed the return point, but you could have at least built it correctly.
New to watching your content, but my goodness the amount of knobs included in these videos makes me absolutely die of laughter every time. Such efficient engineering sir!
This Episode absolutely showing that you are Not an engineer
5:24 he even left an opening at the end of the “valve”😂
Man. U made a mistake, u made all the walls on the side but gave freeway to water in center . That wasn't gonna work anyway.. U should have built a V Shape wall in center first followed by the thing u made on side.
Did you mean to do a cock and balls? I missed the commentary.
Don't even need to watch the video. The answer is no you Elon musktards.
Just show the clip, why 20 mins. Thumbs down too long
I feel like it wouldn’t speed up/slow down because it’s not actually a closed valve.
Although this is similar, I would argue there is much left to make this a Tesla valve. Specifically the fact that the waters return is to a straight channel when it should be angled at the direction of the waters  inlet offset
your walls should have reach the middle... to capture more in the loops.
That isn't even a tesla valve
Wow i need this
Wtf, it isn’t even a Tesla valve.
The Video **OPENED** My Eyes (at 5:23 and 7:40 ) 🤣🤣😂😂
"Bracing piers" looks like some hairy balls to me. :D
You need to put more effort and research, thats not the exactly how tesla valve looks like, you miss a few principle
The second he said "up the shaft"... ded
We all ignoring that it’s the shape of a penis?
5:25 yeah, phallic
Lol
Nice how you designed it! Looks like a rocket
This valve was designed work with a gas not a liquid.
5:25  Hehehe.....
Just before you cut a hole in the tip …. The child in my was thinking what about the tip😂
do a concave wall in front of the city and u saved humanity with a tesla valve and a barage wall :D yayyyy
Not a great Tesla valve lol. Should be alternated or offset from side to side, and the middle path should not be straight and open. The water should be almost curving back and forth between each point. That valve needs work
Is that a giant fucking cock! That’s fucking hilarious! Fucking brilliant! Fucking Love it!
No idea why this showed up in my feed today.  Not going to pretend to be a civil engineer nor any kind of expert in tsunamis, but I think your starting assumption is wrong.  If you watch the tsunami videos, it really does strike like a *tidal* wave.  I mean, "tidal wave" is actually a good name for it.  The water level suddenly goes up, but it doesn't go away, and then it goes up again, and doesn't go away.  It just pumps and pumps until it floods over everything.  It's just not a huge wave in a big wall of water that crashes in.  A system designed to dissipate energy isn't going to work.  You need a valve that actually shuts closed and stays that way until it's over.  Think of it this way... the first warning sign for a tidal wave coming in is that the water level in the bays goes *down* and it stays down long enough for curious people to wander down and get in trouble.  Long enough that people are warned not to go near the water when this happens.  Well, when the water comes in, it comes in for just as long, longer if it spills over into areas that don't naturally drain well.
Funny. Big male member finishing. Maybe you didn't see it.
This design is 🤨
Do I have to point it out? Lmao
Bro has to know what he made
Looks like the baffles in a firearm suppressor.. Amazing!
Those aren't mountains...they're waves            being attenuated by tesla valve mountains
Anyone Else thought he drew a Dic
He didn’t capture the dynamics of the tesla valve, but he did try edit- he did post another video that looks better. he listened to these comments.
Funny how you use a Tesla Valve in your video title, show what a Tesla Valve is, and then do not actually design or render a Tesla valve at all in the video...
The valve should have a smaller gap and few more channels.
Musk doesn’t deserve his name.  One was a genius.  Not so concerned w $.  One is megalomaniac F who wields his financial power like a weapon.
5:26 … Penis?…. And the city on the….
Why didn’t you add any diamond shaped, triangle, wedge, X or C shaped, center line blocks/obstacles before the baffles?
The structural improvement at 5:23 is hilarious!
I wonder more about vortexes and government denial
🙈
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is this the city of Bell End?
It was close.
The video begins at 12:50
I watched the video and enjoyed it BUT..I wanna be that poking little goblin and say, that the title is kinda missleading, because Teslas valve was never designed to actually STOP liquids, but just drastically slow the current. So it was futile from the beginning. :D And here you go.. My inner physicist goblin unleashed.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can you do the double-slit experiment /w tsunamis plz
5:23 i know we were all thinking the exact same thing
squirt
wang
nice
Remember when the government censored him and stole all his pattens remember sounds like what Biden is doing with anything fossil fuel related to push a false narrative
I like this but I don't like how you show the Telsa diagram but then don't build exactly what the diagram illustrated. You made your own version of it which is not as good but City Skylines probably wouldn't of made a difference.
If you compare what you built with Tesla's design, you should notice that the water does NOT have a straight shot up the middle in Tesla's design.  All water in BOTH directions is diverted one way or another, but flow in one direction is hindered by the geometry, back into itself, but not in the other direction.
Tesla valve works with continuous flow. To stop the tsunami? block it like your first wall! that's it! no over engineering it... why allow water to come in? it's a NO - NO...
glad everyone else already jumped on the not a tesla valve issue... little unfortunate given your channel name and all.
H m m m m m m m m
When you build a valve, but it turns out looking like a dick at first.
lol Genius
This is just a diffuser tho
5:30... you mean to tell me that it was "just the engineer in you"... that had you draw an appendage with hairy accessories?... sure. lol
Brilliant 👍🏻
Shouldnt a tesla valve intersect in the middle?
9:30 wouldnt the choke point only make the water faster if the water was under pressure? nothing is pushing the wave through the gap and so the reflections resulting in loss of wave height (and no gain in speed) make sense to me
You sir, owe me a whiskey & coke along with a new keyboard for the 'bracings' section...well done!
i believes the valves should not be directly opposite to each other but alternating on both sides
There is a hint of a Tesla valve in your design, but this is definitely not a Tesla valve.
Sussy shape
I’m watching this with my kid and when the bracing piers got finished and we saw the shape I said opp and rolled my eyes.   They clearly didn’t pick up on it and were frantically like what what what did I miss.🤭
At th halfway point, wouldn't it be better to start redirecting the water left and right with a wide opening at the ends?
This is not a tesla valve ... at all, the design is really different.
I love how you utilize the P.E.N.I.S. structure theory 🤣
Designed a  d*** to stop a tsunami. 😂
oxford accent over-rated.
5:24 funny how utube allows d. pics, as long as its science.
Sort of? Lmao. Without him we have no AC, transformers, radio (marconi stole it and after him and was inferior), wireless charging and the rest. Greatest inventor of all time and maybe in another 100 years we'll realise our current EM calculations are wrong and he is right.
Tesla does what Edison can't
Hentai enginering

May I suggest Bell End City as a name
Is this guy really an engineer ? He doesn’t seem to understand the basic functioning of the Tesla valve…
Nikola Tesla is Serbian 🇷🇸
The tesla valve is stored in the balls
This game might have the worst fluid dynamics I've ever seen
This is in no way a tesla valve. You need to take a better look at the picture
the water does not decrease the speed is due to a preset to not let the water stop, so we left its speed as constant to never stop
5:05 - 5:28
I think it would've been way more effective if you shorten the length of the valves to give the nonpressurised water to turn around faster and counteract the main "shaft" faster. But super entertaining I never knew I could get these mods for city skylines I'll have to try it out!
5:19 “bracing piers”…. then got me spitting coffee laughing.  Ah thank you for that one
I thought the bleed off gully at the tip was a great idea for releaving physical stress.  This area is particularly prone to building up fatigue so regular release would be necessary.
Those 2 big scoops on the side of your valve center should be the intakes for the valves.
That’s like a suppressor valve
Where can I get this map
This turned into how to make a suppressor really quick.
Bruh, you didn’t even make an actual Tesla valve. 🤦🏼
thats not a tesla valve btw.
just make the city behind the wall you psycho lol. you already won, dont make the only path directly to your city
The water física are completely correct  just study a little bit , great video
You need to follow the original model => curves !!
you didn't make a tesla valve. you just made a uterus.
As a non-engineer, all I saw at the start was a giant knob and balls…..
He never even made the Tesla valve correctly. The channels needed to cross cross through the middle
velocity is only affected if the water is in a pipe where it cant get taller or shorter
Nah 5:23
5:23 LOL
If Telsa was so smart, how come he's dead?
Lol I see what you did there.
Cities Skylines
Why leave the gap? Kinda defeats the point of a tesla valve. They need to be set up like counter points. Shouldn't be a huge gap down the middle. But to each their own.
You still left a straight channel through the centre? Hardly a tesla valve
Good test to see how effective their physics engine is.
yes im immature.. and yes i noticed the phallic shape.
Would it help the water not overflow the top on the first set by letting it flow onto the first return?
Civil engineers, turning rat traps into cities.  Or was it the other way round?
Your final design reminded me of the baffles in a suppressor. I wonder if the theory is similar.
The great Wall of Payniss
it wasnt a tesla valve tho
12:32 - that’s not a Tesla Valve. That’s just a big wiener.
12:32 SUS
Inconclusive if a Tesla valve will stop a tsunami…. Because you absolutely didn’t create a Tesla valve.
The Tsunami Tsuppressor
And that boys and girls is how you build a suppressor.
That's... just a giant penis.
genius
5.25 hehe noice
The physics engine you speak of won't be expensive forever. We have games that are moddable like kerbal space program for realism now, that's better simulation then the world had when we first landed on the moon.
I got it…..giant bathtub drain.
I wish this game had water erosion physics.
Thumbnail doesnt look like a real tesla valve, those are connected, they don't have an open portion that goes straight in the middle. This looks more like the inside of a simple suppressor.
noted: penis valve not effective. or very effective, depends on the wanted outcome.
When does he make the tesla valve?
7:13 Really? No one is going to address the giggle in the mind of the civil engineer? My 14 year old adolescent inner child is crying laughing.
U didnt make it right.
This game's physics are much different than the real world.
This seems more like a sound suppressing device for certain noisy mass drivers, some of which borrow from Tesla’s design
someone should revisit his physics books ....  16:10 hy should the wave speed up there ... a increase in speed is happening if THE SAME VOLUME of water is forced A SMALLER PATH. at this point the incoming wave is cut in pieces in a width equal to the width of the narrow paths .... i.e. there is no difference in pressure. if u force the WHOLE wave into such a small channel, then yeah. but only if the wave has no way to dissipate the increased energy by a bigger amplitude of the wave. i.e. flow velocity increase would happen in a closed tube, but not an open valley.
You have engineered a suppressor not a Tesla valve
Shouldnt it be asymetrical?
Lol engineering the perfect sausage
a bit weird shape tesla made
you made something more akin to a suppressor baffle, you have to stagger the baffles and loop them back on themselves with a teardrop shape in the middle
D but educational
so, that's not quite a tesla valve, and all the talk of hydraulics is I'm fairly certain wrong because that's not a pipe, it's a trench.
Dude he was adding the hairs i mean reinforcements and he was like yeah we use this all the time to absorb impact and i was like hmm interesting.. *wait*
5:30 🤣👏🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👏🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Where is the tesla valve?
that's not a tesla valve! the flutes need to be at alternating angles, so that water does not have a direct path through
The Water Physics in CS is great and funny
5:23 - Yep, totally normal. Nothing suspicious going on here. 😂
Life within walls- AOT
🤦🏼 How can you work from reference pictures and build something that looks absolutely nothing like the original? Just how?
Your tsunami defense is more like a flash suppressor than a Tesla valve. Because the Tesla valve implies an asymmetric arrangement of damping nodes and a curvature of the central channel.
hey, your fluid dynamics theory from the beginning doesn't apply in the first part, you're not looking at a fluid stream but a wave. Not the same thing
Big Dick City 🗿
I'm glad I skipped forward to the end to see how you made a 20 minute video without building one single Tesla valve. Saved me a lot of time.
The funnel works because it's not a river, it's a tsunami. In a river, you've forced the same amount of water into a narrower passage making it incredibly fast and dangerous because it's still got the entire river behind it pushing it forwards. A tsunami is not at sea level so the funnel introduces so much wave interference that much of the wave actually dissipates under it's own force. And because it's just a wave (essentially) it hasn't got a whole waterway behind it continuously providing force and pushing it forwards.
5:22 ok... well, I wouldn't call that a wall, but fine I guess
Sigh really  A pwnis or a dildo qoth ridges
Tesla also went crazy and tried to marry some object
You've got a bit of QM occurring there!
aaand in 5:30 we achieve.... demonetization!!! fifth grader in me could not resist....
A) That's not how the tesla valve was designed.  B) The tesla valve is designed to operate under a constant pressure.
Maybe it's because I am tired but for a moment I thought that Elon bought Valve when I have read the title.
In a pipe the water can’t expend energy by escaping vertically…
just gotta ask, why didnt you actually build a tesla valve?  you used some of its ideas, but would have been nice to see if it works as it does in real life.
instead of putting a lot of effort int to enlarging the shaft why don't they just make a protection over the entire hole?
Reminds me of a suppressor
The speeding up and slowing down of the water isn’t going to work the same way it would in a pipe because this is an open air system where there is no pressure affecting the narrowing or widening. Instead the wave will just become taller or shorter. That being said, I would expect the narrowing to be a bit faster, but only because of the pressure from gravity. The widening water will probably maintain velocity as far as the momentum can carry it.
So 5:23 is a reason why Youtube comment this video))
This isn't a tesla valve.  Its close, but the middle being a straight shot makes it not.  You are close, though.  That said, its kinda clear that it wouldn't matter much if it were an accurate one, because the game says "fuck off" to accurate physics.
Bro idk what you think a Tesla valve is, but that ain’t it 💀💀💀
You built it wrong...... I waited all that time and you never fixed it.... I was waiting for you to fix it.....
he made something dirty with his landscaping tool
Leave it to an engineer to repeatedly show a schematic of a tesla valve, but still manage to not build it correctly.
how does this arrangement compare to simply a shaft that is the width of the opening?
As to the speed issue the equations which uses cross sectional ares are true in a pipe network but if it takes less energy for the wave to fight gravity (climbing up and increasing the cross sectional area) than it takes to accelerate, because of the larger area the flow rate would not slow as much as anticipated.  I think..
this could easily be a 2 - 5 min video
that's not even a fucking tesla valve 💀
Tesla Valve would only work in a confined space to force the water pressure against itself, preventing it from expanding.
somting sus minute 5 27
This is very similar to blood vein (the ones that return blood to the heart).  Inside each vein are elastic pieces of tissue that will close when gravity pulls on the blood and will open when the heart pumps the blood up the vein.  The elastic tissue is inverted (compared to your design) in veins because they need to catch the fluid (blood) instead of repel it.  While your "Tesla valve" gates don't close, they definitely are representative of the same design (although inverted).
Educational/Engeering video turns into an adult video😂
You made baffles like a suppressor, not a tesla valve. I would love to see the offset of this in action so it's a real tesla valve.
You never actually built the valve
7:01 1st December be like
U didn’t do a tesla valve
I wish we had a tesla valve like this (※not a meaningful railgun) in front of my town.             ↑I know I have created an atmosphere of futility, but I was living in Osaka at the time, so I have no experience with tsunami damage. m(_ _)m However, most major cities in Japan face the sea, so I guess I am not a stranger to this... Thank you very much!!
* Sees that he made the valve into a pp shape * *s i g h* * goes into the comments section *
Ide like to see you do this again but offset the valves like a real life Tesla valve to see how much water you can stop.
if you do the Tesla valve more correctly, which mean asymetric, it would even be better
wow thats so cool its amazing what you can do in some video games with real world knowledge definitely checking out more of your Videos 🤩
Guess what the water broke
5:23 In terms of maturity.........  We have no maturity

this is not a tesla valve

I was sold on the bracing pillers. Hook line and sinker. The zoom out was perfectly timed humour.
damn I literally watched the other tsunami stopping video and thought "what about a Tesla valve?" then I saw this
In reality it would be difficult, as it would have to be extremely high: If the mass of water is prohibited to move forward, it needs to be able to rise up. If te valve design would not make it high enough, the water will spill over, and the stil incoming water of the tsunami will push it forward with high speed, basically making the consequences of the gsunami even worse
Suddenly relevant again, the Tesla valve is a great thing to use for the entrance to your nuclear bunker as well. You'll still need a pretty good door but it won't have to deal with the full force of the blast wave.
Shoot a Tesla valve at the speed of light and time/space will be warped creating a space of perpetual existence/nonexistent/black hole Create a magnetic field between two Tesla valves and you have time travel Narrow for future,wide for past careful of wide/past as you can become stuck and you can also alter the present and future time stream  I EAT ICE CREAM AND FIND HAPPINES I.E.I.C.F-H Ionizing Electrical induction Conduit Funnel = Heaven or Hell Also referred to as the great Halo Harbinger Harkening Hemisphere Horus Hades Hydra Hermes Helius  Happening Herald Hope Ect ect
Not to be confused with Elon Musk, a credit grabbing rich guy.
yeah...about right for a civil engineer.
5:30 you made me spit my drink man! HAHAHAHA
i mean.. its also not a actual Tesla Valve... but close enough i guess
Um.. Not to talk shit about Tesla or anything.. But.. The reason any of us are sitting here watching anything is.. DC power.. AC may be delivered to your home.. But almost every single device that uses power then converts that AC into DC and it uses that...
This guy doesn't build a Tesla valve, it's not even  nearly looking as tesla valve xD  Man, do it properly one more time.....
Ok are we all pretending this guy didn't just draw a weird looking diick
this is crazy! lol i was just watching your last tsunami video was like i wonder if you built a tesla valve if it would work with the ingame physics
You basically created a silencer. Have a watch at how silencer are made inside, it's really similar to what you did :)
Epic engineering at it's finest. Great job
5:24 You son of a b!tch 😂
"will this tesla valve" yea that's not a tesla valve lmao
after the valves, because the water is so low, you'd just need to have like a water canal divert incoming water in a more controlled way from the front of the city around the sides, maybe back feeding into another river or something that is sloped away or at a different altitude of the city, and then you'd be good
Actually placing a tesla valve under the surface of the ground undermines the tsunami above it. It doesnt need to be walls.
The reason the water speed isnt affected is because you arent changing the volume of anything. Changing the cross sectional area is meaningless because the flow rate can always be modulated by the height of the wave. For changes in speed due to that kind of thing it has to be a sealed system
5:19 xd
Not a Tesla valve
that's a dick of a move hahahahahahahahaha
Bernoulli would be disappointed
I think I saw something inapropriate
The valve can't "stop" anything but the can slow down and weaken one direction quite well, and with no moving parts!
Looks like a giant ladies fun toy.
źle wykonany dławik kierunkowy tesli
Dislike
i feel like you really didnt make the tesla valve correctly.. need a redo
Nlkinda late on this but doesnt a Tesla valve required full encapsulation for pressure to increase speed of the water
Tsunamis are stored in the structural piers
Ah, Yes, the great almighty penis valve tsunami blocker
Umm, why did that long canal and the two things at the base look like a cock n balls?  lmao
That's one very efficiently designed Tesla valve. Very strong, too.
If you go into disaster view you can see the velocity and direction of water flow - it'll make it easier to refine the design.
Make a City on a hill and make the wave go up the hill
Good ol Bernoulli’s theorem
In my experience the Tesla valve is much more effective if used to {encourage flow} than suppress one. Made of Al. and set in the right orientation is excellent at heat sinking.
But…. I thought the Tesla valve was asymmetrical? You made it symmetrical
If you use that much dirt, just build a flat wall...
Where can i get the flat map ?? Link??
Really wish I could post the screenshot of you showing off the uh…… shaft…. Of this Tesla valve, accompanied by the ad for Siemens I received before this video…. The synchronicity is uncanny.
Matt was that one kid who used to draw Dong's on the tables 🤣
you didn't test it tho
Why dude why did you make that
WOW YOUTUBE FR?
Could this be utilized in the design of a city in real life to make tsunamis less tragic?
i meant to just pass out to sleep to this video (which i did, thanks for helping) but then in the morning, i got some breakfast and now im learning about physics n stuff. picture me impressed, i knew tesla was a gem, i did not know about the valve.   dankeschön, from germany. off to the next video 😀  ps.: subbed <3
The design is perfect
Who saw the Penis?
Do you own a bird all I can hear half the time 😂
When the teacher is smart but fun and every day learning is fun and are parents wondering what going on 😂 (why do I want you to teach in my school)😂🤩😝🥰
That valve is sus
Hey ive worked with those valves before! :D (not tesla valves tho)
take a look again at a tesla valve
Itd make it  go quicker if there was nowhere else for the water to go right?
or yk just build a wall
10:30 really gross error there. the flow speed slows down when a fixed volume per time of fluid is passing through widening cross sectional area. In this case, however, the cross section of the water doesn't necessarily increase because it gets lower while also being wider, and the flow speed could actually even be quicker depending on friction parameters because the water gained energy by falling. A similarly opposite is true for the narrowing case.
Water suppressor
13:02 that's basically how gun suppressors work and look like as cross section
bitch the Tesla valve is not symmetric
Как по мне данная конструкция по принципу больше напоминает глушитель для оружия, но в принципе работает.
I feel you made it easy for yourself, you should of curved the wall you put across to increase the water flow through the "shaft"
5:23 sort of looks like uhmmmm, use your imagination
Well it's possible in better shapes than on pic and also more efficient w other structures
Electrility?
There shouldn't be a straight line through the center.
YOU DIDNT TESLA VALVE!
You should make this again but actually making the Tesla valve design properly
But the main water has to like turn, so how will this work well?
Wow, this is a channel full of mature people. How did he make a perfect dick and not even point it out
Ok but this is not a Tesla valve tho.
If im not mistaken it works on preasured pipes, that means it shouldnt work, but... Lets see the video hehe
7:57
At 5:24 wth did you mean that?
If the wave move faster this will success, but how if it's slowly raised 🤣🤣🤣 have you think wanna build tunnels for decrease the amount water and split it back to another side ocean 😅😅😅 tunnel is the best solution for water, we cannot HOLD it but we help it flow to another's side directions 😅😅😅
any else freaked out  thinking they heard a mosquito on 18:40
That was not a Tesla valve.
I really wonder how it would work when build more accurate. Your build doesnt really look like a teslavalve.
If you would disturb the phase of that wave in the tesla valve, making the walls unsymetrical left from right, then the city would survived from the beginning...
Dude. No talking and hold camera still.
Quick someone make a skylines mods for fluid flow simulations. Preferably one that doesn't cost $5000 a year per user
hmm.. how do I make a city to test a tesla valve? Easy, just make a giant dick shaped city XD 7:12
"Cause I am a child."  Yes. Yes we are.
Would have been cool, but clearly the game doesn't do the physics right, and the design isn't really a Tesla valve. Feels like bait & switch.
Nicola was Croatian
the test channel was wider.  You built inside the test walls narrowing the path.  Shoudl have built the valve outside the test walls, keeping the same wave approach width
Electrithody
the picture of the tesla valve  in 1:21 almost looks like how the inside of a suppressor on gun looks like if you cut it in half, so does that mean that should also thank Tesla for suppressors?
I love Tesla, but I also kind of hate him. He was a genius, but he was also genuinely insane in the later decade of his life, so there are all kinds of ridiculous ideas he had that people hang onto and you can't point out how stupid they are, because they'll just play the 'misunderstood genius' card to completely ignore reasonable doubts.
this is NOT a tesla valve. such engoneering needs more precision. for example, the central part is surely not that wide and straight
One of the most famous serbian scientists Nikola Tesla!!!
Definitely not a wiener....
Real Civil Engineer says that the input fluid velocity is different from the output fluid velocity when the cross-sectional area doesn't change
Dude drew a dick roflmfao
You didn't build your Tesla valve properly it should be offset and overlapping
I have a question for engineers...how can you design literally anything to fix any problem but we still have to go to work?
You should put a drainage point at the back of the city so that any water that does come will not get collected in the curve. But will drain out and enable the drying of the city
What is said: tesla velve in city skylines What it actually is: I called a suppressor a tesla valve and thought it would work
So the Tesla valve is just a vasectomy then...
senilykS :seitiC
is that a.....P****s?
Fun fact: the same type of valve shown in the diagram in the beginning is used in modern day suppressors for firearms to disperse sound and the muzzle flash.
Matt I have a teacher so old he helped Tesla at Niagara:)
Dont forget perfume salesman too
I'm a bit disappointed.  I thought you were going to build an actual Tesla valve, like a replica of the black and white Tesla valve picture you kept flashing on the screen. Oh well, slightly misleading.
expected tesla valve, experienced gun suppressor
.?
Kinda looks like a suppressor...
That literally isn’t even a Tesla valve
Bruh, this is not for children. I thought I was watching something about Tesla and then, 5 minutes into it I was watching something completely different
Ayo that way he made it 💀
great idea ! As this valve is way dependant, you should make another, parallel to the first, in the opposite way to demonstrate this.
You failed the tesla valve, it isn't just curves equidistant side to side, the valves alternately come into the middle, which would significantly more effectively deflect the wave, try more of alternating side to side as opposed to just symmetrical valves...
bro where chalk up u been, it is so cool
That is not even close to being a tesla valve. 1: A tesla valve isn't straight. 2: The loops should not be mirrored on both sides, they should alternate (look up tesla valve to see what I mean).
This entire video is a d joke...
good job mr builder
Sus
A Tesla valve is staggered, not symmetrical like u had
Boner City
secret phone calls looks cool af why is this not a thing?!
Thats not even how it looks
Why not just build a wall
As many others said, that’s not a correct Tesla valve. There are no unimpeded straight shots through a Tesla valve.
I like the Prince Albert Parkway that runs through channel walls.
Great possibility, but that is not a Tesla valve.
The penis valve
5:30 looks kinda sus
Damm i must have a perverted mind. No one else sees what he drew. Pause it at 5.25. Just saying. Was it intentional?
Nice SIM. Great illustration of the workings of a Tesla valve. However, a tsunami wave has ha wavelength of over 10 km.  If you have a wave of that length the fluid dynamics will change considerably. I also thinjnyoubwoukd have to adjust the valve dimensions to account for the wave length.
Why aren't the sides offset like in the diagrams?!?! Probably would've worked better if you built it properly.....
you needed to offset each inlet and outlet, but other than that, pretty cool.
it's been a LONG time since I've encountered this, but isn't the speed/pressure thing input _cross-sectional area_ and not just the linear gap such that your constricting valve isn't slowing the water because it has infinite area  to adjust into?  if someone could point me to an explanation I'd be grateful.
yep the city will always be wierd ofc
This is closer to how a suppressor works then how a tesla valve works
Well done.
My face when I saw the design 😐
This made me curious if this idea of yours could work on controlling violent river floods let's say in flashfloods caused by typhoon or much worst, dams? And if it can be applied in real life?  Edit: I saw your Beaver video but I am curious for its applicability in real life
That’s not a Tesla valve…
The shape was totally intentional, no way it wasn't
fun fact: 11:00 this is a suppressor channel
to anyone not understanding: a tesla valve works by dividing the wave(or water flow) and using it against itself. the baffles turn some of the flow to collide with the opposite flow. much like noise canceling headphones work (soundwaves collide with each other cancelling each other out)
The best analogies for water and electricity flow are people during black Friday going through the main door, and kids in a pool with two basins and a small channel linking the two
Probably already said, but couldn't you make a small tesla valve for the river? As it's a one-way structure, it would allow the river to flow without allowing the tsunami in, wouldn't it?
alternate title: Does a surpressor stop a tsunami?
Never actually made the thing. Shows the right design as a reference. Proceeds to do his own thing. A real Civil Engineer without a doubt.
In the Tesla Valve, the main "road" is supoused to be in zigzag, facing one of the deflection canals in each corner. If you let the main road straight opened, you're not puting any defense against water; the only "thing" that is slowing it, is distance.
My wife who works in marketing looking at me funny while I'm watching these videos.  My response: one day you'll be grateful I watch these videos 😂
... the valve is wrong... Ahhhhh 😂
7:01 Ok, I see what you built there. LOL
Grrrrrrrr!!! traffic control concrete!!!! I hate civil engineers!!! Your monsters!!! let me turn left!!!
C’mon.. waves does not speed up or slow down..  It’s a WAVE.
The physics does not say wave should speed up.. it will move to the dicrection of least resistance - and that is upwards.  Speeding up the water mass would need extra energy, and just by narrowing the path, it does not provide any new energy.
Lord man, Health Class just received a bit of inspiration for the next class.  :)  That's funny
The shape is a little sussy
5:29 🫣🤫
This is the worst water simulation that I have ever seen. Minecraft has better sim lmao
Pp
0:04 electrizity
Susssszssssy😅😅
You're Tesla valve is kind of.... off.
5:30 anyone else somthn
5:26 it looks like a long sword
So your comment about the flow going faster when in a narrower place is correct but it doesnt work here since you have extra volume in the vertical. in pipe flow, it would behave as you said, but you probably know that. if you put a roof on this channel, and redid the test(not sure if this game can do that) then it might increase the velocity to maintain the same mass flowrate
I was watching, and saw 5:24 , and was wondering: why it took a so suggestive form???????? (polluted mind)
5:20 This work was made by a professionnal. Don't reproduce at home...
The velocity of the water was kind of affected in the last one it was further back
sharft
your bracing pears that absorb the impact in 5:23 are looking like 😳😳😳 and also 7:39 😰😰😰
This is a 30 minute video about a cement dick...
ong thats how i am right now
“Electrility”
The concept might be more valuable for greening the deserts by lowering the energy of of flash floods and getting the water to hang around long enough to sink into the land. Deserts often have small rocks to make the walls, otherwise like it cement or just shaping the land like swales... Tesla valve swales 🤔
tl;dw - Water still reached the city.
Lol 5:25 Kock’N’ballz!
If you moved the valve closer to the beginning of the shaft would it help?
At the beginning, the walls with the bracing just looks like a set of male genitalia. 😂
I couldn’t help but notice how sus the time spot 5:30
Beats the Musk valve which drowns kids.
I thought it was called an Edison valve
5:23 Its the pp
amajing even tesla theory works
Not a Tesla valve, but an amusing video regardless 👍
Haters gotta hate, albeit funny you upheld the mental picture I have of engineers. They go to school for years and still do their job wrong. All you had to do was copy and paste the design and then you go ahead and make it wrong...now I have to load the game and do it right...thanks...my OCD is strong with this one.
Well it’s not a Tesla valve AT ALL or even RELATIVELY close to one. But I mean, I guess this was fun?
Is this the same way a suppressor on a firearm works?
I think this can stop several megatsunami coming close to each Other. Can you try? It Will not avoid t'he city to be flooded but no Big wave will ever hit t'he buildings.
Beautiful shape
Bruh that first design LMAO 🤣
I just can't with you right now... incorporating dic drawings in an engineering video...  /sigh.  However, 14:45 is 100% accurate.  I'm a truck driver of 30 years and that simulation WOULD happen irl.  The general motoring public is in fact that impatient.
You could run the river down a Tesla valve to stop the upstream incursion but, people being people, who would avoid build a city so far from all that unused beachfront?
I can’t believe I fell for his excuse for making a ball sack
Tesla valves don't have a straight path....
the water looks nothing like water and the scenery isnt helping
Yes, the giant penis is absolutely a structural thing. Super important for integrity.
It doesn't speed up because you left it somewhere to go. It gets taller because the narrowness requires it to conserve energy by storing it in potential energy. If you had something to restrict the height that it could store it at, that would result in an increase in pressure and then you would have your increase in speed.... That's also not how Tesla valves work. Tesla valves work in principle by wave cancellation. They essentially reflect the wave onto itself which reduces its strength. They don't slow the wave down... You keep saying that the simulation is wrong and that that wouldn't happen in real life... But the physics simulation actually looks extremely accurate to me. Wave speed has nothing to do with the width of the channel. You're confusing Bernoulli's PRINCIPLE with Boyle's law.  However, it is the Lagrangian that determines wave speed and that is dictated by density, and temperature. Since both of those are constant in your simulation, the speed of the wave is also constant. Notice, that if you constrict the wave, you're increasing the pressure and therefore slightly increasing the density and that would increase the speed. Notice also that as you increase the energy in the wave and the wave gets taller, the bottom of the wave gets faster because of increasing pressure. This is essentially making the speed of the wave more diffused thereby preserving the gaussian function and keeping the bulk speed of the wave constant.
I would love to see this test in From Dust, which is all about water. There is even a map in it with high waves :D
Easily it won't stop it, since it doesn't stop flow but it does resist the flow  So it may reduce it
Great
Not very attractive, but interesting idea.
Kinda pointless, but fun
I'm pretty sure most of the theories and mechanisms talked about in the video only work when there is a constant flow (of liquid) instead of a single wave. And how is the Tesla valve supposed to slow down the single wave when the wave has already passed the point at which there should be reversed flow? The theories talked about in the video are true, but the experiments are flawed. I'm an engineer, too. I did my thesis on computational fluid dynamics simulations.
So Tesla invented the gigantic dick?
Funny, add Tesla to devices name and 99% of population thinks it suddenly gets magical properties
A little sad that you didnt try a true mono path testla valve, but very interesting to even see this style work as well as it did
for the first part, the reason it's not speeding up or slowing down is because this is not a high-pressure system. so yeah. that's it. also, the gap is to big in between, make it as thin as the gaps on the sides.
Okay, so maybe you can clarify this, but what you build was not actually a Tesla Valve, was it? The core design of the Tesla Valve as I understood it, is that the design is not a mirror one, but that when left has entry to a reroute, on the right side it would have ones exit, to force the currents/tides against each other to weaken them. Whereas your design was perfectly symmetrical, potentially creating the opposite effect of where the water would build additional momentum.
Tesla was killed because he wanted to give too much to humanity for free
Electricity is owned by nature. It wasn’t invented. Nobody gets credit for that. We simply just figured out how to harness it for everyday use. Typical humans. Trying to take credit for any and everything 🤦🏾‍♂️
That's one giant   Weiner weiner for sale buy one get one Weiner for free 😂
what if you would offset the opening of every valve to the sides so that the water cant reach the city in a straight line
bro, you failed.
5:23 I'm 12 btw :)
did yall see that guy was putting impact help things but when he went to bird's eye view we all know the true intentions behind it lmao
5:23 insert male anatomy jokes
You were supposed to stagger the inlets
I am not that interested in Cities: Skylines game but totally appreciate the educational value of learning by doing. It is most important to develop an intuition before getting down to math.
Not much of a tesla valve but it's similar to a muzzle suppressor. Keep adding baffles and you'll stop the wave.
Are you a bad enough dude to save the city of Bel-Ende from a tsunami?
The design is wrong as you put the structures on either side parallel and symmetrical. This isn't a tesla valve.
That's.... Not a Tesla valve at all
This is more realistic than real life🤣
That’s not a Tesla valve.  That’s…. Something else.
"The invention of electricity" what...
The water in the first valve didn;t need to accelerate because the energy was displaced into extra height. Your understanding of physics is slightly flawed.
:D:D:D you f*cker, made me look at a di*k pic on a work computer :D :D
'car manufacturer' is really pushing the suspension of disbelief
Looks like a suppressor
Its too inline needs to be a little offset so the resistance wave hits the mainstream therefore creating the resistance your looking for
The Tesla valve was designed to handle pulse waves, not continuous flow. Also the internals of the valve are offset so that in the blocking direction there is no clear path through the center. Would like to see it done again with a correct placement of the baffle walls.
Tesla once again impressing me with his genius. This man was on a whole other level.
"The main tsunami heading up the shaft" yeah none of us were fooled with the buttress explanation.... :D
btw the physic here is mostly nonsense :D so please don't bring too much real physics thinking into it... the new generation is braindead enough.
He real had to call it the tip because if you are not 10 years old the I think you can figure it out
Your venturi at 9:20 only works in a "closed" system like a pipe, or the end of your garden hose when you put your thumb on it. The taper must leave no room for outward expansion for the fluid to accelerate, as it's expansion, at that point, would be, as you said, from right to left. That's why your wave got taller. You have the right deal you were just trying to use a 2D drawing within a 3D system. Also, the Venturi is used to create a vacuum at the point of acceleration. That is how the car wash sprayers with the soap container on the bottom of them work. Your hose water sprays through a Venturi which creates a vacuum that sucks up the soap from the container into the spray nozzle, mixes it, then sprays it on your car.
Pretty sure it's just doing the simple 2D wave equation, not actual fluid dynamics (which would be too computationally intense to do at this resolution and this speed). So wave velocity is constant.
5:28 LMAO
This video, should be 5-6 minutes long, FFS. 20 minutes doesn't help drunk people like me focus.
Funnily enough this really reminds me of a suppressor’s baffling, and it seems to work in a similar manner to it too
The ramps leading up to the tunnel are probably a cost calculation.  Your walls get thinner toward the top, so it's probably finding the breakover point between the expense of the tunnel distance vs the expense of the height of the ramp.
Your valve is not a correct tesla valve design, it's close but not correct. You should try making it correctly and it should work many times better.
Halflife 3 confirmed.
Was this one big Dick joke?
Hmm interesting....but Id liked to of seen the other "overlapping" style of tesla valve....mainly as a side by side to determine which is better and why that might be as it pertains to fluid morphology, hydrodynamics and general physics.
Would probably work even better if the valves were asymmetric instead of even on either side like that. Like staggered back and forth along the sides.
You want to create a device to stop an incoming tsunami I say use shape charges you could develop a system that detects the incoming wave calculates its size and velocity chooses the proper explosives package and creates a wave from shore towards the incoming tsunami wave to create a cancellary state between the two waves you can't tell me this is not a decent idea I mean it might not work The technology might not exist it may be too difficult or even impossible but you got to admit it's a good idea
I'm so glad the narrative changed. When I was a kid it was Edison this and Edison that.
you did the tesla valve wrong...
I love how everyone in the comments are professional engineers lol
Yeah. Not a Tesla valve. I am greatly disappointed.
why not stager the valves like the real one?
"I guess you could call that the tip".....I see what you did there 🤣
Aww, who else was hoping he'd build an actual Tesla valve and not whatever this is?
Which came first the Tesla Valve or the Maxim  Silencer?
you're hilarious bro lol
a bad engineer ...
Tesla valve works only in constantly flowing water, that way the curved wave hit the constantly flowing water, stopping it, and it does not work in one big wave. whereas when the curved wave hit the main stream back, the first wave is already past the junction having no stopping effect whatsoever for the first wave.
With all due respect, this doesn't look like a Tesla Valve. Love videos but if you could try an actual tesla valve I would love to watch, even a shirt vid.
That is NOT a Tesla valve
That's more like the design of a suppressor for a firearm than a Tesla valve
I see what you did 😏 Great video, really fun and educational. 💪
5:24 ???? really?!?!
Way to draw a peen at 5 minutes 28 seconds
How to screw up making a basic tesla valve 101 nice work!
I got a ad for city sky lines
What about putting a triangle Island just before the valve right in the middle I don't know like 15 ft before.
This absolutely did not need to be a 20 minute video… the information density in it approaches zero. 95% is just an inordinate amount of irritating babbling and reiteration of the thing you just said over and over again. Like, you need to be interesting if you’re going to go on and on like this. For fucksake.
done right it would work with responsible geological application
5:30: You "guess" we could call that the tip? Dude 😂
I feel like I got Dick rolled, and that sorry was hollow!
Truly heart breaking that the velocity didn't get affected, kinda makes me sad that we didn't get to see the first arm of the valve stopping the flow 😭
You used properties from a tesla valve but you didn't actually make a tesla valve
The  River Thames authorities should look into this when it comes near time to replace their tidal barriers.
Looks like you made something similar to a gun suppressor it would be interesting to see a real Tesla valve simulation and which is better at slowing down the water.
@7:02 - bro what you making?
That traffic is like Atlanta.
Is no one gonna comment on what it looked like initially? xD
I guess that's 1 way to dick-tate how fluid mechanics works😎
how about some strong pillars in the middle?
You need to do this again. That wasn't a Tesla valve. Disliked.
That's not a Tesla valve tho
It would be interesting to see what would happen if most of the valve was under water
Well, I’m 5:52 in & initially I thought why not put the Tesla Valve in along the river to totally prove the concept, but…. I see what you did, and my childish side approves lol Edit 1: I rest my case! Edit 2: A proper Tesla valve alternates sides for return and they slightly offset allowing max flow out but minimising flow in. Think if you did that You’d save the city getting wet completely
This neglects the fact that valves can break. And would certainly break if you tried to push a sodding tsunami through them
Engineers in Venice, Italy are busy searching for the terrain menu so they can copy this.
That should be called dickhead city. Lol
It’s probably best to keep your camera shots right on your.. structure.
This is a split tesla valve, a real one doesn't have an opening in the middle.
The island walls in the middle of each valve need to be extended towards the centre more than the main walls. Also the first walls the tsunami contacts should be island walls too.
Real funny teenager humor you got right there, pal. Couldn't even finish the video.
And here I thought that you'd build the Tesla Valve around the river, the natural point where your flood wall HAS to be opened, and take advantage of its mostly one-way properties.
reminds me of a suppressor for a rifle
A wise culinary teacher of mine once said "Water doesn't flow up"
I think the face that this tsunami is a very rapid "pulse" of water means that it's not exactly what the Tesla valve was designed to be good with.
5:23 I was umm.... then I was like Ohhhhhhhhhhhh lol
Why not just make the actual Tesla Valve? You did everything but.
Can you maybe try building a Tesla Valve instead of whatever that was? The design is way off...
does not look like a tesla valve at all..... Its a big fail. Tesla valves are not straight!!!
did it need an open corridor down the middle? the valves could be protruding to create a chicane or zig zag for the water.
Part of the genius of the Tesla valve is in the staggered nature of the design.  I’m surprised this worked at all.  Nicely done.
Didn't do anything a wall with a slot in it wouldn't have done. Terrible simulation.
5:23 LMAO 😂😂😂😂😂
The traffic opting to not leave any space on the road rather than avoid the flooding water I feel is very realistic to how actual drivers act these days.
Nikola Tesla is the inventor of electricity, not “sort of one of the main contributors” to it.
make a the valve have veins like tesla turbine to take advantage of the drag.
.... what Tesla valve?
So it’s like a sound suppressor on the muzzle of a rifle?
I wonder why they didn't code in Bernoulli's principle for fluids.
I actually think the valve isn't too bad. It isn't a Tesla valve, but since it's symmetric, there are two waves coming in the opposite direction of the main wave (instead of one like in the Tesla valve), so the effect for each individual loop is smaller, but there are more loops. Pretty cool!
You are not flinging the water back at the main wave faster. Yes the path is more narrow but the path doesn't narrow down thus pressure does not increase. You're just cutting off a part of the wave along a straight path thus you cannot have it speed past the main wave and hit it back. Some slight adjustments to your itteration of the valve and it should theoretically be possible it's just that in practice you'd need an extremely long path for it to work or you'd need to have the path itself progressively narrow down to a really really thin jet. If you are having problems with visualising this look up how High Explosive Anti Tank rounds work. Also known as HEAT/hollow charges or metal jets. Besides that I cannot think of anymore improvements to the design at all.
You have the walls of your Tesla valve parallel, try it again with them offset, or an exact copy of a Tesla valve, and where the water curves in the valve the diameter of the walls should be the same diameter of the curve that way you don't lose water pressure and it pushes back, on this model you could slightly decrease the backflow by narrowing the walls so there's more power as it pushes back.
Any fart joke videos like humor bagel?
But.. you didn't make it anything like the tesla valve..
For a not-Tesla-valve valve, it functioned exactly as expected.
Me when your mom.
The bracing piers were a nice touch  I think there needs to be little bridges going in weird directions, like a veined network over the canals
You didn't follow the model! You can't claim to be using a man's design, when you spent most of your time slowly coming short of actually using the setup right
5:25 "Sorry Sir, we can't follow through with building the walls: public opinion thinks it all looks like a phallus from an aerial point of view; so therefore the whole design has been deemed too offensive to pass legislation."
I implore you to look at a picture of a tesla valve next time.
That’s no tesla valve as it should do a zig-zag in order to work
Not exactly a Tesla valve but properly the most practical version of one that could find application in the real world.
5:25 I see what you did there.
It looks like the Valves in a rifle suppressor
wow. how to stretch 1 min content to 20 min.
You had a diagram and still built the valve wrong. What you have is a baffle.
Am I being trolled...
Just make the wall straight
A funnel would increase the velocity of flowing particles of water, assuming constant flow rate through an enclosed pipe (not an open channel like we have here), but it doesn't affect the velocity of a wave propagating through a medium. So the wave should not have sped up at all going through that funnel. And the side wall friction would have slowed particles, reflecting the wave, adding pressure, and increasing the height of the wave, while reducing the flow rate of water towards the end of the funnel. The game correctly modelled all of that.
cock and balls city?
peace, love and plants
"We'll call that the tip"🍆
The tesla valve cant actually stop the flow of water instead tremendously slow it.
Am I the only one that noticed that massive wanger
Assuming the laws of physics are programmed in cities skylines.
The general theory is correct, but your main channel shouldn't just be a straight line. In the example you showed, you'll notice that the main channel will wander back and fourth leading directly into the side channels. It'd still see SOME reduction of flow but not nearly as much if you're relying purely on your liquid 'spreading out' over time, especially the smaller in scale ya get. TY for the video though (:   Edit: OH I just saw your updated version. I hadn't even read through the comments. Honestly, good on you to run it back and admit a mistake
Tesla rolls over every time someone plugs in a battery. Thus, he is spinning faster than a mag motor in his grave.
Continuous flow dynamics and impulse dynamics are definitely not perfectly equivalent. What you have is an impulse, what you're basing your hypotheses on is continuous flow.
I noticed how much space in general inside the curves from the end of the separator wall was too wide. If it was maybe made closer to the partition end, it would have made increased blowback against the wave faster, making it much more productive and much less work with the design in general.  Also, if I'm gauging it correctly, the Tesla valve did a slight overlap behind eachother for a much better effect.  Thought that might help a little.
Yah, but... wouldn't a bunch of dots do almost as well? Like, they wouldn't even need to be as tall as the wave itself, just being obstructions removes energy from the wave. It's the whole reason Mangrove forests are so valuable for coasts.
wrong shape, The tesla valve does not have a straight open channel, front to back. try again. it will 100% work.
Haven't watched all of it and am avoiding the comment section. But inb4 this is all an elaborate penis joke.
Isn't that design meant to slow down constant flow not the initial hit of the water?... Whereas the Tesla one is designed to slow down the initial flow due to it moving the flow back and forth?
This looks like a "fuel filter" for water
YOU Need to shift them not to be Exactly facing each other for more efficiency
17:57 is when the real action start c:
I think you could improve your design a little bit. In the tesla valve, the islands are alternating on each side. On your valve, the islands on both sides are identical. The sides are mirrored. If you alternate the islands I think youll get a better result
Mad how water electricity and air all seem to act the same way
Wow, nice hair on the twins.
The hairy buttress balls, I mean walls were absolutely structurally critical.  Stay sophomoric my friend, you have to grow old, but you don't have to grow up.  :)
The Tesla valve is meant for continuous flow,  you are dealing with a transient flow.  Also flow that is narrow is not faster, its flow that's been narrowed that is faster.   So your diverted flow paths need to narrow, then they would speed up.
I always was amazed how damn good the water physics were. They have no business being that good
What was the name of the software that you used to work with?
You could also call that the Vagina Valve? Because it pretty much looks like the opening of Uterus/Cervix.
There is a very good reason why the Tesla valve isn’t used anywhere. Can anyone guess?
Lost me at "inventor of electricity..." That's like saying "Archimedes was the the inventor of water."
@5:01 Thats a record for how LONG it took for you to start this MONSTROSITY, atleast this time its fairly wide...might even use the word GIRTHY.
Ima point it out Just pause on 5:24 And you’ll see what I’m pointing out
so basically... you just wanted a excuse to build a big ribbed dildo in city skylines.
5:24 - U dirty dawg hahaha lmao
5:24 coincidence? I think not
well that’s not a tesla valve so
the wave speed on water wont change for a gravity wave. you'd need to simulate a mass flow
Not exactly a Tesla Valve you did there, but you got the spirit lol
You built a silencer for a firearm. Good job 😃
5:25 when Tesla valve be *_actin up:_*
that is most definitely not a Tesla Valve.
Your shaft doesn't have enough girth
So why not use this along dammed rivers in the event of dam breaches?
what is the point of this valve???
Me just now realising what he made XD 5:25
I got a use for that valve and it ain't this.
You overlay a Tesla valve as you build nothing like it.  Bravo.
Lmao 🤣 the traffic
This would be a fantastic way to have a harbour entrance or a river outflow through a tsunami defense wall🤔 Open and closed at the same time. 😏
Wouldn’t it be easier to just deflect the tsunami? If you have the resources to build an intricate valve how about simply building a wall to block or deflect?
This causes me to wonder if it would help to place little pillars in the openings of the channel walls as well as a smaller channel on each side of the main channel to build up more speed then the og tsunami and curve it back at the very end to help diminish the very last of any water that may make it through
Is that Jelly fx or jelly fix? I'm thinking it says Jelly fix 🤔
the valves are supposed to be closer together and staggered
at the end you said we'll never get real-time fluid simulations in games, but I'm 90% sure that AI research is going to crack it within the next year or 2, if they haven't already. it's coming soon, either this gen or next.
Your design is not like a Tesla valve
Great video about ejaculation :)
the design is a bit different. it looks like tesla valve but it isn't. am i wrong?
Want a game to have full accurate physics simulation like tens of thousands of dollars of software.
How tall is that
I like the Idea of these vids but I am tired of  youtube putting people I am not subscribed to into my subscriptions.
Sorry, this is a wrong design, please check the Fig.1 ( 1:20 the ture Tesla Valve ) out.
Super fun video! You should have had longer valve sections over lapping R,L,R,L. Instead of having that big open channel in the middle. No?
As soon as you said in the first 5 seconds that Tesla was a main contributor to the "Invention'' of electricity''  I stopped the video since No One Invented Electricity, it was only Discovered.
10:07 , I’m afraid I’ve been single too long for where my brain is going while seeing the *ahem* points of compression
Having a 40' levee around the city would have kept the water out completely. Good demonstration.
At 5minutes and29 seconds the wall definitely did not look suspicious
What’s this game
Someday this experiment will save millions of lives from Tsunami.
Elekdridity
I mean, it's not a Tesla valve. Maybe try making it correctly and retesting.
"The hydraulic theory" lmao. Making water flow through a narrower nozzle only speeds it up if its actually narrow. making the walls closer together without making a ceiling that compresses the flow as well doesn't do anything.
I think if you had offset them, the way tesla had designed, you would see an even greater reduction of water, even in cities. It would concentrate the pressure more for each loop it comes across.
or you could just curve the top of the wall
For some reason the overview of that map reminds me of something. Well played. 😂
That isn't a tesla valve you made. For one the tesla valve has no change in the channel total width, so the water should maintain volume/height the whole way. For two the valve uses smooth walls to turn the wave.
5;30. I see what you did there.  Hairy balls.  😄😄
how about if the valves on the left arent symmetrical to the right like it's a bit off
If the water was to speed up when the channel narrowed, I don't see how it could conserve momentum (mv) *and* kinetic energy (0.5mv^2). Because it's free to get taller, that seems like correct physics to me.
Impractical
I am sure Elon musk could figure this out
This is such a dumb experiment
Dunno if you realized this, but the entire thing from the start to end is shaped pretty much as a d*ck. Just sayin'.
What you've essentially created here is a model of a gun silencer or "Baffle" (which did a very good job of reducing the sound/water wave). Tesla valves don't have a straight channel through the middle by design.
Thank you for tNice tutorials, tNice tutorials was a huge help.
Looks like a supressor!
Cool model but tesla valves don't have a straight center line. It has offsets that help cause a disturbance through the center line.
Am I the only one who noticed he drew a big Willy with the sea walls
You totally missed the point of the Tesla valve, this was more like how a silencer in a weapon works, by taking small parts of the force and slowing them down and trapping the kinetic energy by use of individual baffles. if you looked at the shape of his drawing, you'd see the water flow is diverted in a zig-zag motion.
If you had made a bigger valve on left and then on the right it would completely stop
I think the game is correct when not speeding up the wave going through the converging nozzle Indeed the hydraulic theory tells us that the flow rate remains constant In this case, this is no classic hydraulic problem since we have no pipe bit a channel with free surface So what seems to happen here is that the wave going through the nozzle gets narrower but also higher so the flow section remains constant and so the flow rate (which equals speed times section) and the speed can both remain constant
This is one of the most elaborate knob gags in human history. I love it.
thats not a tesla valve though
With all due respect...after your very first experiment failed to mimic real world physics? Every subsequent experiment is meaningless.
I love your humor lmao.  Absolutely amazing! 👍🏻
Did.....did you just say "I gotta do this because I'm an engineer." And then proceed to draw a dick?
But i love this video Keep up the good work!
You might want to try staggering the return channels, and making the walls intrude into the  central channel so that the wave doesn't have a completely unobstructed path.. Interesting attempt, though, as you say, it doesn't really model the physics very well.
"Check out my invention being tested in Cities:Skyline" - Nikola Tesla
Got a like as soon as the cock and balls were revealed. 🤣
pause the video at tesla valve so im guessing it design to hold the water in area by area till no enough force behind the eater
💖
Welcome to Bellend City
Well played
5.23 that's a penis
This makes me think of a muffler on a car.
You have no idea how grateful I am for tNice tutorials series
So, you're statement about the physics makes faulty assumptions.  The water will only move faster as it narrows if the pressure on the water is continuous, as it's the pressure, not the water that's causing the increase in speed.  Instead of that, the water was moving forward without continuous pressure, which meant they were losing momentum the further they traveled up the shaft, which is why without any sort of walls, the water already lowered enough that only the smallest buildings in your city were damaged.  Also, how did you manage to look at that diagram over and over and not see that your walls looked nothing like the Tesla valve?
Now do it again with a tesla valve
Gee im glad my urethra isnt a tesla valve
I would think they would need to be off set on each side
take your fluid dynamics class again.  wave propigation does not follow the same rules as fluid flow.
5:26 this looks really inappropriate was this intentional
20 minute video without a single tesla value :(
I dunno- can it?
Why are you asking us?
this was engineered backwards this guy is daffy, you got no clue dude
commit something harmful Civil Engineer.
Mfs from england: "electrility" youre braindead
Looks like the baffles inside a suppressor.
Rip
Not correctly designed valve tho
Theres a saying that you could get an engineer to build your house but you wouldn't want to live in it.  I have an appendation ti that saying. You could get an engineer to build you city, but you would not want to live there.
This would be a good anime story argument, an apocalyptic world where cities gets hit by tsunamies all the time, and every country or city has their own valve to stop the waves
@5:23 it was at this time when he realized he done messed up! Lmao! 😂
You gotta permit for that wanton destruction of wetlands????🤔🤔🤔🤔
Did he just troll us with a 🐓&🎾s
Look on Tesla Valve one mor time please
Fascinating. Your design 5:25 might be a bit cocky
That is not a tesla valve, one of the key features is that the loops are offset, so the returning water from loop 1 will crash with the free flowing current going in to the second section, slowing it down, so it uses the force of water slowing down water, here you just have water crashing into walls with a small opening in the middle. Also your loops need to divide the flow in 2, not just make a hook for water to crash in. I recomend you to study and understand how tesla valve works and then redo the experiment.
The left 4 dead valve made me laugh tbh 😂
Theoretically we could prevent real-world Tsunamis from destroying civilIizations with this?
8:00  you could decrease the land in the middle so the wave does not shrink (as of now it is going uphill )
i could be wrong but the consept of this has bveen applied to gun suppressors
Hello.
I'm pretty sure someone has told you that the design you did is not a telsa valve configuration
This design looks like it would work really well, to quiet and slow rapidly expanding gasses.
Can a Tesla Valve stop a MEGA TSUNAMI in Cities Skylines? I don't know, and after watching this video, I still don't know.
5:27 bruh ☠☠☠☠☠☠
5:29 Is that... what I think it is? XD
Try doing your wave strike and flood simulations with DualSPHysics, it is an open source engineering SPH code for exactly this kind of problem. It is a research code for GPU based SPH, so it is likely to be ahead of the commercial code you used at work, wrt simulation speed, scale and accuracy.
You are such a child making a D on a kids video game.
Twig and berries
This dude didn't even make a real tesla valve, he just made incomplete versions of it stacked, expecting them to work
The final design became more of a baffle design like a surperssor than the alternating lobe design of the tesla valve.
The vains on the shaft saved the people!
I'm sorry but u haven't build it correctly. If u look closely u will see that the Teslavalve has no straight Chantal. It pushes the water from left to right permanently
Firstly thats not a tesla valve, second a tesla valve speeds up the medium flowing through it! This is utter rubbish 👎
"Bracing piers" he says... that's a bellend mate
I actually think the simulation was more accurate than you gave it credit for. The reason you mistakenly thought the water should speed up is because you were thinking of a closed tube system with a constant input of water versus the open three dimensional tunnel system with intermittent waves of water. In a closed tube, water fills up the entire circumference of the tube and therefore has nowhere to expand except going forward along the tube. Therefore if you want the same amount of water to go through a smaller section of tube, it has to move faster. But in your simulation, the water is free to expand upwards as well as forward, so it can get the same amount of water through the narrower passage by basically stacking the water higher. And since the water is coming in waves rather than a constant pressure like in a tube, the water that bounces backwards isn’t being met with the same kind of resistance that it would in the tube scenario.
5:25 Alternative title: How to cockblock a Tsunami
Ugh your design is ugly 😆😆😆 but nice job
Somehow i think about a fire arm silencer..
I'm sure hundreds of people have said this already but that's not how the valve works. :D
You had a diagram of a tesla valve, so why did you not make a tesla valve?! LOL
Stagger the arms, that "hole down the middle" shouldn't be there. Check the valve design again. I would subscribe to that.
The front of the tsunami isn’t affected by the water turning around since it models the water moving at the same speed. Meaning by the time the water deflects. the tsunami front has already moved past that area. So the reduction up front would’ve worked the same if you just made straight walls.
I need to call ATF for this gigantic suppressor...
I reckon the best way would be to have the clear path down the middle narrow slightly, going towards the city. That way, the loopback channels closer to the city should catch more of the wave to channel backwards and slow it down even more.
that's not a tesla valve, its a silencer
Do the double-slit experiment!

So many valves! (leaves out check valve, which is what a tesla valve is)
You are confusing a wave with mass flow. The tsunami is always the same speed, just height changes, simulation is very accurate in this game. The tesla valve is intended to create much more flow resistance in one direction than the other, not to break waves!
😂
Alternating sides would be better and along all the shaft. I didn't like the ✨aesthetics ✨ but it's a work of art, and it shows exactly what you wanted. So it was 100% profit, 9.5/10
With baffles like that I bet the tsunami was virtually silent
Yes the tesla valve will save your city. Now you just need to call God and tell him to pause the Tsunami and build a giant tesla valve for you in front of your city.
isn't it supposed to be staggered?
Pipis
This wasn't a true nickla tesla valve
Cool idea .  If you reverse the valve direction,it should speed up the water.
You haven't got the pattern right on your valve. there isn't a clear path down the middle as you have it. It's asymmetric.
The thumbnail isn’t a Tesla valve, is it? There isn’t supposed to be a straight channel through the middle.
Thanks for making this video!  I felt that my question was answered! :D. It certainly functioned slightly differently because this is a wave front simulation instead of a persistent current.  But AMAZING nonetheless
I'm a bit annoyed that you didn't actually make a Tesla valve.
just add two or three trenches in front of your city with a proper drainage and you are peachy
A better demo would be the Tesla valve on that river.
Tesla valves aren't straight, so the returning liquid can kind of "fight" the ongoing one. But worked nice
If you add smaller walls down the middle lane to slow the main current, it would work even better.
So a Tesla valve is basically a giant penis.
God I hate my mind
I'm way to tilted that you made it wrong. No lie.
As for an engineer I expected you to be able to follow simple drawing of a tesla valve.  It is not a tesla valve.
I must have a very dirty mind. n. e. v. e. r.   m. i. n. d.   ......
My dude that’s not even what a Tesla valve looks like there’s curves and turns, I have no idea what you claim to have created but a quick google of what a Tesla valve actually looks like would’ve helped you in your design process
Are you an actual engineer?
Knowing the water physics, it wasn't really the valve making the wave shorter, it was just that there was something kind of blocking it.
das a peenus
I'm taking my first fluid mechanics course in uni and this is the video I needed
Kinda butchered the Tesla Valve, but entertaining non the less. The Tesla Valve doesn't have a straight channel through it's center, which would have done a lot to dissipate the flow in this case.
Why didn't you make an exact tesla valve ? It was interesting tho. Do another vid, and madel it exactly like the real valve. 0 water will make it thru
This video is just explaining how a firearm suppressor works.
Just wanted to put this out there as I think you got some hydrology stuff wrong here!  In response to your claim about the water speeding up when the flow path is restricted, this happens because the flow (also describes the energy) of the water wants to remain constant, though the morphology of the terrain can convert the total gravitational potential/kinetic energy of the water back and forth).  Flow is measured in cubic feet or liters per second.  When a river constricts, the entire amount of flowing water is effected, because less water can fit through the space at once it must speed up for the flow to remain constant.  In this experiment you have divided the water up, meaning that the volume of water flowing through these channels will be proportional to the size of the channels and the velocity change will reflect this relationship rather than that of initial speed or total flow to channel size.  I think their water simulation is better than you gave it credit for!  Otherwise very interesting and cool video idea.  -whitewater guide and nerd.
5:23 REALLY ??? LOL
Sus
Did Tesla design cities skylines?  No.       👎
Tesla valve doesn't have the middle open like that, this isn't a tesla valve.
So your going to build these on every coast/city susceptible to a tsunami….. ridiculous!
The map looks, worrysome. But a man of culture
You looked at a picture of a Tesla Valve, then didn't make a Tesla Valve...
interesting city skylines has atleast some level of physics engine thats rougly accurate... next...a 3d version that redirect the water back completely?... (u flip it 90 deg and burrow it into the ground...)
A sea wall after the valve would keep it safe and dry I reckon
This is engineer porn, and I'm all for it
Nicely done, I wonder if the returned energy would work even harder for you if they were off set?
Electricity wasn't invented, it was discovered.
that isnt a tesla valve, there isnt a straight line in the middle.
From the moment I watched this channel for the first time I knew I would love the videos. Welp. I was correct
Not an engineer, but aren't tsunami waves longer? Your peaks here are relatively short in relation to its height. Videos from Japan iirc show water rising an flowing in.....and while still high, flowing in more, maybe 1/2 mile long before the ocean relaxes briefly.
love the effort but this is just not a tesla valve, i can’t blame you for not perfecting it though, it’s not like this game has the most top of the line water simulation
My eyesss IMAGINE SOMETHING HAHAHA
is this the same concept as  Bernoulli’s Principal?
This was in my recommendation and I am very pleased to meet your channel
That’s not a Tesla valve…. You just made your own design😐😐
In what wave theory does the wave slow down if another part of the wave is diverted?
Shaft City
Oh lort
I shoulda seen the peen coming XD
who else is here because of Ludwig's video?
Did you consider to move the city up the hill :D
so you showed us what it is, then built something different. ok.
not a tesla valve but okay
it looks like a penis, is that by design, or subliminal?
Really interesting shape
i would like to see you try the same in a game called from dust
You need to make the front a funnel.
you didnt make a tesla valve
Some of the water buildings show the direction of the water and indicate strength with arrows. That feature could help illustrate where the water is going in these simulations. Great stuff
i wish we had a Tesla nowadays.  He was so far ahead of his time.
5:22   🤨📸
Oh this woulda and coulda been so cool but you sadly didn't make a tesla valve
im NOT gay hiding on the comments
e
Satisfying to watch
Nice! Can you also pls try a 【REAL TESLA VALVE】 with the 【proper OFFSET】 (from each side), can't wait to see how the REAL one performs vs this one! Cheers!
Me thinking great minds think alike at 7:38
If you was to remove all the flood gates and replace it with high landmass it would Fix it! Your welcome
I wonder if this would be useful for protecting shipping channels where they meet the ocean. They would need to be built incredibly sturdy because of high erosion forces, but I could see it working as a good passive alternative or supplement for something like the Thames Barrier.
I was like- “why is he doing inverse radii on those 90’s? That’s not as structurally sou… oh.”
The thing in the thumbnail is not a tesla valve.
You never created the valve properly, the Tesla valve does not leave a way straight through the middle
Yeah but you did it wrong
Ludwig watched this video on stream and posted a video :0
ludwig
This is a cool video but where is the car
Selfie toasters?
The problem is that these aren't pipes. The height is open so the water doesn't speeg up in smaller canals cause it can just extend in height
I knew the strongest shape was coming the second he made the two lines
I woulda just gone with a reverse river, start with the middle shaft as before but slope the shaft upwards and split in the middle, then curve both splits back towards the main flood barriers and have them run behind the wall towards it's corners to be emptied back out into the sea, as long as the river/drainage is above the sea but below the wall tops then any spillage up top and from the corners will just flow back out anyways
5:24, me thinks that was deliberate XD
yeah that was nothing even close to a teslavalve, you even had a picture of it, and FAILS to build it... yeah no more comments on this FAIL "real civil engineer"
5:23 = .I.   XD XD XD
How would this compare to the valve flipped the other way? I suspect that it might work similarly well.
5:24 lol
Man only if they supported it instead of dragging it down 😅😳
imagine in real life there is a stunamy and god aka Real Civil Engineer just blocks it ha ha
Did you even look at a TESLA valve when you built this? If you did, please convince me it had a giant gap running all the way down the middle.
there must be lower cost ways to stop tidal waves ./
ELECTRICITY WAS NOT INVENTED!  it was mearly discovered.  as it's a FUNCTION OF REALITY and you can't INVENT those nore should you be allowed to copyright or patient
17:30 so far your doing good!!!
well if elon aint good enough with his stuff, wondr if the prime TESLA akak nikoa stuff could do better!!!, let this video find out!!
Uses tesla valve backwards: still works
No one expected that at 5:23 🤣
I’m like 5 mins into this and have no clue if this is a joke video or not. 10/10
Emirates gonna go "We need this for the line*
Engineering the Penis Valve?
Why not build a funnel to give the wave more power going into the valve? Show how much it can handle?
The first build look in weird shape i suppose
Electricity isn’t an invention, it’s a discovery. Sus
the water physics reminds me on how conways game of life works
Top shelf engineering dick joke….Bravo
Would the velocity slow in that system? The volume/sec has slowed. I think if the valve wasn't just a cross section, then the slowing in volume would translate to a slowing in velocity. Right?
You ever going to make this as a proper Tesla valve.
Ok as an ME I am a bit rusty, but this isn't  a closed system like you would see in a valve. In other words this is not a valve but an open topped cutaway of a Tesla valve. The way I see it the Bernoulli equation has a term for potential energy (due to gravity i.e. the height of the fluid), and that if you increase the speed of the water the pressure goes up. You can't increase pressure since the whole thing is open so the water goes up and down rather then speed up or slow down. The simulation looks spot on to me.
Wish you would have copied the actual design. I'm curious about how that would do in comparison.
Or you could just, make a wall
5:26 there’s no way he didn’t know what he built lol
Build a maze for the tsunami
"Invention" of electricity? I don't think that word means what you think it means. Also, look up Faraday.
anyone else noticed he built a giant dk?
isnt it just cheaper & easier just to build a wall across the coast? you literally built a huge wall across the coast and then left a small bit open and let all the water in thru a much larger engineering project that makes a tesla valve using up valuable land & resources when u could have just filled that gap with a wall
so all you need is a trillion billion million tons of concrete to make a billion huge tesla valves pointing in every direction for 1000s of coastal cities in tsunami danger zones and we will all be safe.... oh and the squillion bazillion bajillion dollars needed to build them all
Huh.... so the tesla valve is kinda setup like a flowmaster exhaust.... kinda cool.
That's not a tsunami. A tsunami is not a massivly high wave...
also the portal valve *ba dum tsss*
I think that the flaw in this game's water physics is that water travels between map cells based on its speed, which is probably the easiest way to program flow, but as you can see it's not accurate as it is heavily simplified. But that's just a speculation on how it works. If I were to program this (having no engineering degree lol) I would make a powder toy where cells have two values: amount of water and speed vector. Speed vectors of two cells decide how much water is going to be transferred between them. Cells transfer their speed vector to all cells in the 180 cone in the vector direction. Cells adjacent to ground reflect water in all possible directions. Based on the amount of water in a cell it will also try to spread out a small proportional amount in all directions, so waves and ripples gradually die out by themselves (which is obviously not a thing in this game) A lot of tweaking would be needed to make this even look realistic but I think that's the right way to go.
After watching the video and reading the comments, I'm wondering if you plan to redo the test and try to correct the tesla valve method? I'd really like to see(as harshly as this sounds, sorry!) a better attempt at this. It was fun to watch but I'd like to see it done more properly if you don't mind
Imagine building a Tesla valve where a river ends into thw sea to prevent storm surge flooding
Obviously, as has no doubt been mentioned multiple times, your 'valves' are symetrical, whereas Teslas were not. Are you doing another video with the valves spaced left to right? The obstruction of a single flow to left/right would also dissipate more energy.
5:24 Neo Armstrong Cyclone Armstrong Cannon
You built it wrong. In Tesla valve there is no way you can look down one end and see thru the other
Hey... HEY!!! I SEE WHAT YOU DID!
You didn't at all make a proper tesla valve. The idea of a tesla valve is to impede the flow and use that pressure to create a backward flow to impede it further.  You had a big gaping hole down the middle which does nothing to impede the initial flow.
So around 8:50 mark you created a venturi :)
you just made a slit experiment... lovely crosses of waves!
If you added some basic floodwalls in the centerline of the valve after the split off then it might slow the centerline enough to let the flow of the sides get a bit ahead and have more impact.  Also, Tesla valve is supposed to stagger the pattern, to force each 'valve' to blockade the following valve.  Good videos anyway!
Your assumptions for a tesla valve are assuming that you're in a closed pipe, where the water cannot rise in height, the only variable in a pipe is that the speed can increase or decrease as the aperture decreases or increases respectively.  In your tesla valve, the compression horizontally causes the wave to squeeze in, and because its not a closed pipe, the water volume is instead pushed up vertically to compensate for the reduction in horiontal space, as thats more physically natural for a fluid than an increase in speed (i think gases work the other way around.) Increasing a fluids speed with pressure actually puts quite a high strain on pipes and I believe Barlow's formula is what's used to calculate this pressure for a pipe, even in a transformative section such as a tesla valve, and I imagine is probably the biggest source of strain on a piping material.  So cities skylines is actually simulating fluids reasonably well, as a tldr, its just not a closed system so it might appear counterintuitive.  Very interesting viddie though, definitely got me thinking!
True engineering, the canal and the geometry very pro!
Love the design process.  Boss: “Team, we’re going AGILE on this design” Team: “How will we test?” Boss: “We are AGILE, we will fail fast… and many many populations suffer our design cycle wraith, with our failures but we will learn! It’s only five of six cities…”
FYI Real Civil Engineer that's not a Tesla valve. Guess someone failed college.
The moment the rounding came in my head went: ah *bad word* here we go again
You should of had a hole at the tip so it squirts at the city if you built it afterwards. Missed opportunity lol.
Dude doesnt know the difference between a tsunami and a tidal wave. Failed to replicate a tesla valve. Engineer.....sure.
This might just be complete gibberish but when you said that the speed of the water should get faster as it moves through a narrower path, wouldn't that be only when there's a constant flow of water? And waves would be affected by gravity so even as its moving forward, some of its mass is being pushed backwards because its being pressed down from the top against a hard surface?
Are you really an engineer because wow everything you are doing looks haphazard. Firstly, you did not make a Tesla valve in any way shape or form. Secondly, a single Tsunami wave is a pulse and pulse behaviour is much different from a continuous wave or flow.
Don't Tesla valves cross the center line? They don't have the sections next to each other either.
Soooo it's a pecker
9:35 i dont think, what i see is what i think it is.
Could this still work if *much* broader? Say, so broad, that the city won't have an occluded straight-on view of the ocean at all? I.e. the narrowest part of of the center of the valve would have to be as wide as the city
the people in the city be like... The tsunami is coming!!
You should probably get the planning roads mod. They do allow you to zone next to them but they don't count as a road connection but they are free
I think what makes the Tesla valve work better is alternating deflections.
He’s not the smartest engineer. He can’t even accurately read a design and recreate it as intended.
wow
I really like how you condescend to the water physics multiple times during a video in which you didn't even do what the title says, namely: build a Tesla valve. The best part is that you learned from the comments that this isn't a Tesla valve and then had to do another video to try and do what could have been done in this video had you but done an image search for a Tesla valve. Where is it that you're a civil engineer? I only ask because I'm compiling a list of unsafe places to travel.
@ 5:24 lol
Why on gods green earth wouldn’t you have used a unidirectional VALVE to allow the river to flow out but stop the tsunami from coming in? You ruined my morning!
Sob pulled us along for 5 minutes for a dick joke to start the video.  Kudos
"just because I am an engineer..."  *Proceeds to make hairy balls alongside a shaft*
Pro tip:if someone made a Tesla valve with that kind of walls The velocity of the tsunami would be too strong and break through those walls
Is this exurb1a's gaming channel?
You should build wall in shape of funnel to gather more tsunamis
Curve the channels that are going into the curved areas
This is a fairly accurate depiction of a baffled suppressor. The tidal wave acts much the same as the gas expansion being slowed down in the geometries inside the tube. Interesting outcome as that wasn't the goal.
Why does shape of your walls look familiar
Electricity was not invented it was discovered. That is like saying Newton invented gravity.
I just realized tesla is called tesla. because, of course, Elon, a genius, likes Nikola TESLA, a famous genius like Albert einstein.  Me = 0 IQ
Not much of a tesla valve innit?   Cool idea to make the water change course after the curve tho!
Wouldn't it be better if one side of the valve was slightly farther than the other? Instead sof having both sides in the same spot?   I don't know if you know what I'm saying
7:10 You really should have created an outlet near the tip of this to relieve the pressur~ 7:39 ahhhh, nice 💯
In this role there should be an option two😢😮😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌪🌪🌈🌪🌪🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈😮
You have a special brain ... kudos for even thinking that one up :¬) Bracing pier lmao ... up the shaft lol ... is it going to "spurt out of the top"? probably, knowing you ... yep! lmao
Glans City.
Ribbed for your pleasure
how about just build the city on the valve
Is there water testing games?
Interesting video, but if I could build that, I would build a high wall instead. Maybe a double door like mechanism :D
5:25 he had us in the first half not gonna lie
the first minute  of the video  is the most educational  part 0:00
The video is a little distracting.
we are getting pretty close to real time simulation of water for games though.
00>26 Mechanical Engineering. Civil and Structural engineers suck at Fluid Dynamics (and pretty much anything that has motion on it).
This isnt Tesla Valve!!
These should be offset from each other and the wall on the inside extended to capture more water earlier.
For a guy who set out to make a tesla valve, with a diagram of a tesla valve in-hand, you sure did NOT make a tesla valve  lol  Like at all
it may be helpful if you actually built a tesla valve but this was entertaining
came here for dickjoke comments, such disappoint
"Because I am a child" oh, I figured that out long before you ever said that..>.> (The VALVe wasn't even built right..)
Technically humanity was built from the tip
Nature's strongest structure
Numbnutz built it wrong..i'm out.
Stevo: This is going to be another of those “hold my beer and watch this” moments, isn’t it?  Me: Oh, you betcha.
I can't believe it, I really can't.  Is nobody going to say anything...  Well?   Okay  I guess it's up to me then?   Surly I'm not the only one?  (i hope not anyway) Alright here goes nothing, Well it not nothing, it's huge for crying out loud....  P e n i s, there I said it.     Whether you know it or not,  Your Tsunami Stopper looks like a giant penis.    No Envy Bro!
is it true that nikola tesla and elon musk founded the company together?
Hahahahahaha
Not that it looked like male genitals at all...
Erm... I thought you were going to test a Tesla Valve.
Mixing tidal wave with tsunami.  A tsunami would have a mass of water behind it, not just one big wave.
really shows that you're not a mechanical engineer
"invention" of electricity? hmm... try "discovery". Creating a path towards our modern world of electrical equipment, sure.
Engineer gaming
dude, did u paint a giant cok with 2 hairy bals right there? :DD Typos are intentional.
Your "tesla ... "valve"" is pretty much sadmade and dont makes me wonder anymore why you are not a engeneer anymore.. if you had be one. however. ... Good thing first soo.. I like the idea you came up with to stop the Tsunamy with an oversice landscaped technicle part... I also like you explain how you build it.. even if you overpush it a bit but I guess its not meant to watch with full focus on it anyway. and well.. thats it on the good part sadly.  The not so good part is.. you may imagen you build a tesla valve but this are just wave braking funnels which force the mainwave into o biger space 5 times in a row. Then you imagen a valve designet for stop the flow of a liquid can stop a wave. next you think your system is enclosed. while the physics you are explaining about funeling liquids into tighter space pressure and spead them up is totaly right but you forget you cant enclose your system in all 3 dimensions. you will always remain to have no roof on your valve and thats to main part why it properly never works even if you Design it corectly with shifted bows along the canal.  I understand City skilines is not a professional 3D designe thingy where you easily copy past landscape and stuff. And everything have to be hand craftet and the physic calculation for flowing water is actualy a pretty hard job for every program simulating it. well thats way you tsunamies need days to come for you in CS.  but still my main critic is on the inacurate teslavalve attempt Tesla should come out of his grave and mock your personaly for it and na its unfair to critice your long talk.. i can skip it gratefully.^^
I guess you would need a roof to make it work like the actually valve, so it forces the water in just one direction (forward) instead of two (forward and up)
Did you mean Nikola Tesla's valve? It is not Tesla valve!!!
But it's difficult to build
Watched the whole video...never saw a Tesla valve.  Not sure what the janky thing you made was supposed to be.  But, I guess it did at least sort of work.
ah.. making it round at the top... what a shame that's such a great opportunity for... nevermind forget it im big adult *10 seconds later* uWu🌸 nice and structured for her pleasure
Lmao
Well the outline doesn't look like something that is supposed to impede flow...
ATF would like to know your location
City is just like: Why aren't you making a huge wall?!?!?!
just wall it off lmao
you even had a picture of the valve, why didnt you just follow the picture?!? the tsunami would not have made it if you did it correctly with the games physics
Should put a a few more canals at the centre of the city and go through the wall, to make it more realistic and spectacular when the water hits.
I'm pretty sure I saw a nice huge dick at 5mins+... made my day, LOL
Congratulations, you just invented a Firearm Suppressor. Police will be kicking your door in shortly.
5:24 he must of done that on purpose
11:35 but how do you mess up the design of the valve when you're copying a source image...
When you made the nozzle I stressed. Were you trying to spray them down faster? I guess the hydrodynamics aren't spot on.
No, because that's not how tsunamis work.  They are a surge not a wave.  It's not about their velocity, it's like a big flood.
I wonder if he's actually an engineer or is he just lying for that as revenue? Does anyone know? Google knows what a Tesla valve is as well so that proves nothing.
Each "lobe" of the valve should be offset from the next.  Thus, the flow is forced to enter one of the lobes.  The way you have it it is not forced to enter a lobe.  The point at which the lobe feeds back into the main channel is the point at which the next lob branches off on the other side.  So you have a series of V's that feed into U's that lead back into the main channel.
I am sorry to say this design only is intended to work with a steady laminar flow and it is not 100% effective but a very good start for a non powered flow restrictor. Additionally, if you made the inlets to the flow reversor longer than the outlet by a 3:2 ratio with the inlet being more narrow, thereby causing flow to retain more velocity and attack the flow it work work better. Lastly, you must have pressure and fluid dynamics intact, and as such have a top of the system. You can't have that with a water break(ake?). Love your content though. Drunk physics are the best physics...
5:23
Bro...its like YouTube was reading my mind...I saw a tsunami vid while scrolling and thought I'd watch it if it used the valve ...and then boom here it is
Title is about a Tesla Valve, you show pictures of a Tesla Valve, and then build something totally different. The physics are quite impressive, but this is not what the title suggests.
5:23 thank you for proving that my sense of humor is that a a five-year-old
5:25. Perv
Interesting shape you chose. My mrs eyes lit up !
you are clearly not an engineer, you should be ashamed of claiming what you made as a tesla valve. there was no redirection of the incoming "reverse" flow to counter the progress of as much of the rest of the flow as possible. you made a giant muffler, you are just an architect.
my guy made a penis and played it off like he didnt know perfectly well what he did.
An important note, making everything perfect symmetrical is how you fail to stop the water. you aren't giving the water blind alley to go down or paths that slow the flow. You literally gave it a very wide straight line down the center to accelerate through. A real civil engineer would have tried to stop the water.
Maybe create a V shaped sea wall with the outside edges shaped like Tesla valves. Could do like 3 layers of Telsa valve walls so waters that tops the first layer enters second layer.
Valved for your pressure
Fact. Thats not a tesla valve😅 i mean. Not identicaly one
tricked my teacher into showing this to the whole class
This is not tesla valve it’s testi valve 💀
The ATF is looking questioningly at that cover design…
Disaster-proofed for her pleasure.
Cool
Now do one with a Tesla valve
Your thumbnail is not a Tesla valve.
you are such a fraud, thats not even a tesla valve, your only claim or gimmick is that are a "real engineer" yet i never seen you use your knowledge so for all i care you are just a random schiz
"I'm and Engineer" yet you can not understand a blueprint drawing....  was still a good watch Edit: Tidal wave and Tsunami are not interchangeable terms my dude.
<3 Nicola Tesla <3 One of Great.
Why does the design have a striking resemblance to a giant wiener? I can't be the first to notice this!!
First of all it is not build right
now this is how school system should have worked
Hang on. Could you adjust the angle of the two unconnected floodwalls relative to the main walls to make the openings tighter? That should speed up the waterflow in the ‘kidneys’, delivering more power. Well, not in cities skylines apparently, but irl?
how u make this big tsunami? I have only maybe half that high or 1/3 .... is there a Mod? the basegame DLC don t give me that big thing to kill my city^^
"loads of different valves" was laughing when valve appeared
Phallic!
ur valve its not asimetryc
this planet is a slave planet they put deceases and cancers into out food and water so we use the hospitals and they can find cures for it because this planet is ran by satanic vampire witches who are look for eternal life by using you all as their test subjects they thinks its funny to keep track of their slave by making dates and time.. everyone on this planet have been slaves for 2022 years now and i think its time for truth to be herd

*Gets on trending*  *Makes NORMALLY shaped city*     Me: Now that's Roman engineering at its finest
That was one massively strong shape. Well done mate!
Should have made each consecutive center opening, half the size as the previous one.
The design is very human👍
That's not even remotely close to a Tesla valve
Are you seriously making a channel that looks like a male genitalia?   Lol frigging hilarious.
What happens if you put a channel in the middle?
I haven't started the video yet, but I'm going to say the tesla valve won't stop it and water will glitch through the walls; not a dig on what i can see of your design in the thumbnail, just because from my experience, water is a glitchy mess in this game sometimes.
A Tsunami is not simply a flow of water that can be held back by a valve. It's a mass that have to be dissipated by free space.
not a tesla valve...
That is a unlicensed suppressor. Atf is coming for your dog.
You know you legit just built a gun suppressor, right?
Videos appear on the YouTube trending list  Still designs a giant dick.  Absolutely brilliant.
Butterfly valve , popcorn shrimp , butter shrimp ,all kinds of shrimp forest
That is not a tesla valve. You made a muffler or sound suppressor.
You got me hahaha. 😂😂😂🖕
THIS INTRO....LOVED IT
You didn’t quite build it properly
Instead of having the valves on just the sides have one ported on the bottom with the feedback routed under the incoming wave to kill its strength and momentum. Also, the ones you have on the sides should be biting off a quarter or a fifth of the force at a time and routing the force back against the incoming wave.
That channel reminds me of a slit for the double slit experiment. Light can act like a wave like water so I wondered if it would have deconstructive interference
Not to be a negative Nancy, but, the valves are staggered and offset from the middle for a reason. There is not a straight pathway directly down the line in the valve. I would have liked it if you had done an actual demo of the valve you showed in the photo earlier in the video.
Oops, you made two mistakes in your Tesla valve.  1.  The redirections are supposed to 100% return to the center, none of the back flow should go through its(redirect channel) entrance.  2. The redirections are supposed to be alternating, not directly across from each other.  I'd love to see a second iteration of this design with these adjustments.  :D
There is an 82 cities mod and you could totally scale this up to the width of the current city.  3 cities wide, so you can put in the valve back flows on each side.  Then as long as you want before the city actually begins.
You need to off set the turn arounds and have the points slightly past center, and it would have worked like it should have. The gap in the middle is making it so inefficient. You dont want to have a straight shot in the tesla valve. But not so tight it couldnt flow fine backwards
I don't think that the Tesla valve like construction was the main contributor to dampening the main tsunami wave. The reason being that the Tesla valve only works because the pressure of the incompressible fluid pushes the main flow back. Ignoring the friction (usually coming from when the wave starts to splash and mix with air), the main tsunami wave and the "coming back wave" should not interfere with each other. Right? I am just interested to see whether you could achieve the same result by just making straight walls with as big as the ones you just had.
Your converging diverging thoughts are backwards -- narrow->wide decreases pressure, and increases velocity, wide->narrow increases pressure, decreases velocity.
5:24….. I see what you did there😂😂
Do you engineering nerds actually use Tesla valves? As a machinery nerd, I think it's cheaper to make 20 normal check valves then one of these.
I don't believe that's a Tesla valve
love that you grew so much, i sware you where at like 100 k last year or two so wow good job dude
That's not a real Tesla valve.  They offset.
Not the engineer we wanted but the engineer we need
But if you invert it, does it go forward without pushing back? Also, we didn't get to see a true valve.
A tesla valve does not have a straight path down the middle. Was really looking forward to this video, but then you didn't build an actuel Tesla valve. A Tesla valve basically always split thw water into two ways, one that curls in on itself, and one that goes to the next split and so forth. The reason your "valves" are working, is because the wave spreads out and flattens a bit after each valve, decreasing the height, but not the speed. Love your videos. Looking forward to see you build the real one :)
Yo yo the TIP, questionable outline. It is where the city starts. Fiction from the edge of walls
Shoulda just made a Tesla valve
I'd love to see you widen the entrance to the valve, funneling the full width wave into the valve channel
5:24 lol
That is pretty epic
5:24 can't unsee
5:30 is that a Tesla dick and balls🤣🤣
The tesla valve is a one way valve its not a true valve that stops water
When the "bracing" was added I didn't know if this was actually going to test a tesla valve, or if I was just getting trolled.
"The water went the same speed down both sides, which wouldn't actually happen"    What do you mean the city building sim game didn't properly model the Venturi nozzle effect on fluid dynamics? Heresy!
Tsunami's are stored in the balls.
He thought he was being so subtle with the shape of the walls
NOT A TESLA VALVE. DO A TESLA VALVE.
So Matt is an Engineer and a Scienist  5:24 perfect engineering 😎👍 Tesla would be proud
10:21 and we can’t just close off the gap so no water gets through at all?
5:30 so we’re not gonna talk about what this man just created? It’s even got hair on it.
I like your vids and stuff but can u please stop putting dildos in your builds
5:24 ... Are you gay?
OMG love you for this !!!! Watching now!
Please tell me this place is called Pen Island.
5:30  he had me in the first half
Another freestanding island at the front before the first curve may have helped.
Imagine how well would a tesla valve work if he actually made it in the game
In a Tesla valve you cannot see through it there is a side chamber that will continue down the valve at a smaller volume and the  part where the main flow will try to go through it is significantly wider and will go back on itself and it's a rinse repeat on that entire thing
Also, a Tesla valve was designed to stop constant flow, not a surge.
That's not a Tesla valve.
I think if you made the gap narrower at the back of the turn-around portion of the valve it would work better as far as water speed.  Which the game obviously doesn't handle all that well anyway.  When I was looking at your layout, I was thinking this might not be a bad idea for piers on a river port.  They may not work for a true tsunami, but they'd help lessen the impact of a tidal bore wave.
There is a huge error in this. The length of the shaft is itself part of the problem. The map itself increases in elevation away from the beach. The wave itself would eventually diminish in height regardless of any "engineering" done here.  This needs to be redone with the shaft itself having it's interior elevation uniform from the beach all the way through to the tip. Otherwise the results of this test, when combined with the improper design of the Tesla Valve itself (as addressed by others) presents far too many oversights that aren't addressed.
so you put a city at the tip of the penis?  i would have put a hole at the tip lol . i mean fluid mechanics stuff.
That's not a Tesla value. Sorry
this wave of likes is putting you on the trending page, wow
Why not the starting wall without the whole in the middle? ^^
It’s a bloody cock-up.
I love how eager the cars are to drive into the water. Boss be like: "So you're still coming in, right?"
you didn't make a Tesla valve, uou you made a gun suppressor
Tesla valves are not symetrical... it just doesnt work properly when its double sided... you didnt make a tesla valve you the the chamfering of the inside of a guns silencer....
Well-hung design, my friend. Cheers! 😂💜
The issue with your first 2 tests is the tsunami it one push so if something holds up to the initial hit it bounces the water back
8:20 speed will increase only in "flow" of water - closed tube entierly filled with water, in this case the tsunami wave is "wave" but not a flow of water. And it behaves as wave, what can be seen in 9:34. But i think physiсs is still not idial, but it becomes much bettter if tsunami is considered as a wave.
isn´t realistic fluid dynamics one of the most extreme things to simulate? I don´t think they will pack it into a game like City Skylines. No normal computer will be able to run it realtime
i like the educational bit a ton, keep it up
What a great simulation of the city of Bellend
18:00 leave a like as a form of thanks.
16:18 .. I think you maybe wrong about that, it's a straight line while the side has more length for water to travel.. Before the water from the side even reach the middle, the middle one already goes through..   Edit : Or maybe it's just the game.. I'm not engineer tho.. Just using logic and common sense..
Skyline physics
@5:20 caught me by surprise and now im in fits of laughter
that Valve shut be un-symetrical.. you just create small, tight fast-flow trace you shut let discharge whole energy of wave on bouncing side to side.. even on picture is NoT SYMETRICAL  and have NO DIRECT path.. man.. pls.. use some of your skill ..
I'm not an engineer, but my guess is you create an underflow in the reverse direction which is not modelled( haven't fully watched the video, so sry if mentioned)
5:24 uh ohhhh
Query: Would putting in dog legs help? Instead of having it be a straight line have it so the water doesn't have a direct line of sight to the city.
Strongest tesla valve in existence
5:25 sus design 🤣🤣
Wavelength in the game is 1 maybe 3km at best while tsunamis have wavelengths in the order of 300km. Though I really like the experiment; this valve is nothing for an actual tsunami
Where in the video did he build a tesla-valve i don't see it.
Tesla valve, but send a stream of sewage towards the tsunami to create the opposing current? 🤔🤔
Vừa vào đã nổi cả da gà 藍giọng a Phúc hayyy quá, mong sẽ tiếp tục cover ạ ❤️
I... can't take you seriously anymore... not after 5:23😂
Would tesla valves of asymmetrical length work?  So that there is no directly visible path from the city to the ocean.  By asymmetrical what I mean is one Long one on the left, the a short on on the right, the next would be opposite, with a short one one the left them a long one one the right. On the long side, it would be longer than halfway of the channel width between the two sea walls.
5:23 I cant unsee
Im no engineer, but I was in ap physics 2, and I think your ideas at 8:12 were right, but in a closed pipe. This obviously isn't a pipe because it's open at the top. Good chance in wrong tho.
Not a tesla valve.  Try again.
1:08 I was thinking of Valve when I saw the thumbnail so I was fully expecting to see it
You made a suppressor, for water.
You sound suspiciously similar to the spiffing Brit
Very interesting, and I'm impressed with how tbe game handled it, but yes, ultimately if the games physics simulated water speed output to increasing by forcing it through a choke it would simulate almost perfectly.
Got stoned. Watched this video for some reason…
I would suggest a few things:  make the tesla valve along the river to save the inbound/outbound roads and make most of the map usable; make the valve segments shorter than the outer walls to avoid spill over; construct the segments in a tear drop shape to increase the resistance to forward flow; and alternate segments from left to right and reduce that giant gap down the middle.  A primary component of the tesla valve design is that each segment forces a significant amount of the forward flow around the tear drop to create greater resistance to forward flow.
I'm not entirely sure I agree with you that those narrow parts "should affect the speed".. At least not by much; It WOULD be true if it was in a closed pipe, but.. when talking about free-flowing water, it's a matter of what would be the easier option; To speed up/down.. or raise in elevation..  (more water pr second can either be done by speeding up, or by increasing the diameter of the "pipe"  at the same speed, and if it would get higher waves, you will in effect be having a bigger cross-section of water, so it may be transporting the same water..   Also; with the first "wedge" you created a bit of a back-draft, which will slow down the water (The direction it had was straight forward, but sooner or later entropy will make the water notice that there is some.. areas behind it which doesn't have water, and the pressure of the water lower down- from the potential energy of water that is higher up- may mean that instead of staying in the direction, it will actually be a lower potential to turn direction to fill out the gap.. and when you turned the direction of SOME water.. it will be a bit of a suction effect on what is left as well, but either way.. the wave loses energy.. which you could see in the form of a lower wave.   I think the main question is.. how the formulas of fluid-dynamics work out with this type of "force" (well; Momentum).. How "difficult" would it be for the water to actually speed up (remember; There is no engine making SURE that it will keep it's momentum), compared to how much force would be needed to "increase the intersection" by raising the height of the wave. I suspect a tsunami waves move at (well; Close to) the speed that the interaction between water-molecules can handle, at least not within a short distance.. (if you were to prolong the narrow channel all the way to the city I suspect the situation might be a lot different.. IF the physics engine is "good" then it should change the speed, but either way it will stop the back-draft-effect from the hidden compartments behind your wedges)
No one gonna talk about what he put near the start of the thing
This tsunami wave is just one wave of water. Tesla valve needs continuos water flow to work properly (also main canal is not straight). Reverse flow is created after the main wave, so it's not pushing main wave back, it works more like suppressor. I wonder maybe would it work on river in cities skylines?
The valves within a tesla valve also have to be staggered on each side to work properly, not symmetrical on both sides.. not that this games water physics is even accurate at all
My personal favorite valve is the portal valve
looks vaguely similar to a firearm suppressor, each manufacturer has differing designs, but sound waves and liquid waves are still waves
even looking at a tesla valve you didnt make a tesla valve....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
well guess that valve can keep serious damages from happening but   it won't completely prevent damages
Your voice makes you sound so professional and fancy but your humour it’s the exact opposite, I love it
Hello it is very ambitious to call me an engineer... but appreciated
I was really looking forward to seeing a Tesla Valvular Conduit simulated...and I still am, if you want to build one next time.
This is why we keep civil engineers busy. This is what happens when they have too much time on their hands.  But really, great video, Matt and team!
60k for 4 years for a engineering degree. Best thing you can think of when someone ask you to design something is still a cock with balls.
5:25 pretty phallic don't ya think? 😂
You missed a classic blue ball joke at 6:45 lmao
To expensive to build human life is cheap. Way of government boys
5:17 You should probably shave your bracing piers. Its the right thing to do.
Lol that beniizer with balls
Part of the army pushing you up the algorithm
This, is a work of art 👌
The tesla valve  free standing  walls are wing shaped which would speed  up one side and slow the other exacly as lift.  Helping to turn the water back into its self
Why would we want to stop a tsunami it could cleanse the the stupidity from the whole west coast
How is it that you've got an actual diagram of Tesla's valve and you've still done it completely wrong? there should be no straight channel down the middle. it should force the water into the side channels with no option to bypass, every single time. that's how the valve works. it has nothing to do with expanding space.
This game’s water physics get so much hate, but honestly I have not as of yet discovered a game with any better.
Amazingly engineered dick! Bravo!
Did you build an arc? Reminded me of Bruce almighty 2 lol
Tesla valve ha more like Teslas D
I clicked on this thinking it would be a legitimate experiment... only to find it became a pathetic excuse to draw a dick in a video game.  Classy. Channel blocked.
This is not a tesla valve. Please build one and show it again.
That's not a Tesla valve, it's a series of Maxim baffles.
5:25 POV
Trump’s wall stops water, bullets, and immigrants looking for a better life
Are you sure you're a real civil engineer? That wasn't a Tesla Valve
I don’t think the middle part was supposed to be straight through but offset…
It would be fun if you actually made a proper tesla valve As a proper tesla valve has no straight line between the start and the end. it's all a bunch of curved "tear shaped" tunnels.
congratulations you have made a penis in city skyline 🤣
5:25 beautiful design
lalena
this is what I've been thinking when I saw this series first time
You could even reduce the height of the walls by 1/2 height after the first set of walls and taper the height down to ground level before you get to the city. After the valves the walls don't really even need to be there anymore. Would be interesting to see how little wall material you could get away with using while keeping the effectiveness of the whole system.
Better solution: add a second wall so if anything spills over the first wall, it gets trapped. Suck up the river into the city's drinking supply so you can have 0 holes in your wall, and a lot of water.
Looks like a giant genitalia to me...
What if the entire tsunami came in and have multiple tesla valves to protect the city?
Do like a tsunami double-slit experiment.  See if you can destroy a city with an interference pattern.
The Tesla valve has a totally different design that would probably work far better than the one in the video, I would like to see you try it.
Why didn't you do an actual Tesla valve?; you had the drawing that tells you how it's supposed to be designed and you still didn't do it right.
5:26 This was too sus lol, couldnt help posting a comment.
Are  you kidding me Lmao what the hell man...I ws like i dont think he will mention the fact that his prject looks like a ummm and then i was like does he notice and then the tip I was like wow wowo wowo he is wow he really did theat LMAO
5:30 "Ah a man of culture"
This is a traditional wave with a crest, however a tsunami has no back as it effectively a step increase in level. That's why it just keeps on going, Can the software manage this type of wave?
5:30 NOO
you need some classes on physics or waves .. you can not change the velocity or flow unless you have the tsunami on a close contanier, tube, so you can forget about velocity.  Also you should have the fins more apart to get better output, and forget about tesla valves, it dosen´t work, you are only fighting one wave!!.. only three fins more apart you will have same or better output, than you tesla thing with 5 fins....
This doesn't look anything like a tesla valve, a real engineer would have built a proper one
Wonders: "Why is this trending for the masses..." /giant dick joke /no longer wonders
It took me until about 6:30 to realize what he drew with the walls. 🙄
well, he also worked on a death ray, so this water ray system is pretty close.
It would have been nice if you'd use an actual test for the valve design not a bunch of tall mountains evenly designed it left the center to open and the water did not flow right with a Tesla valve you have a teardrop on one side and then it drops down to the bottom of teardrop and makes another tear drop shape
This is not how u make a tesla valve. Do it better. Are you a architect??? Or are you a engineer??
Tesla valves are not in line like that.
You accidentally built cumtown.
A Tesla valve is only meant to stop back flow through a system. This video literally makes no sense as you’re trying to use it for something it wasn’t designed for. Of course it wouldn’t stop a tsunami as it was made to keep water flowing in a singular direction. Your content is lackluster and could use more research. The fact that you use big words throughout the video and improperly reference the design while completely disregarding the design is laughable.
Next time, try building a Tesla valve.
The valves are too steep and they have to be offset from the valve on the opposite side of the channel
**looks at the thumbnail** That's not a Tesla valve
bro. you failed.  go back and look at the picture. you built it wrong
The application of Tesla Valve is not really working because the game doesn't accelerate liquids when funneling - the water in those little bypass channels doesn't stop the flow in main channel because it actually needs more time to reach the same spot. Could work if there was a continous flow but tsunami is just a single pulse so the only effect is just blocking some of the water and trapping it in a reservoir.  So not really working like a real Tesla Valve at all.  You could probably try to put some parallel shafts and compare efficiency of different designs.
Around 4 minute mark. Why didn't you make the walls  a little at te angle making a funnel of sorts leading the water to the channel you made?
5:23 sus
It's not even a real tesla valve SMH some engineer you are
Tip: at 12:22, instead of letting the flow enter along the green path, make that “path” be the return wave, meaning enter one before on that side straight into the corner shifting the return curve towards the ocean and stagger the valves from there on by also making them asymmetrical where every “entry path” is a tad longer than the “exit path” of the water flow.
20 minute wiener joke…awesome!!
Why am I reminded of the US Navy F-18 skywriting incident?? Hmmmmmmmmm
This dude just trolled us this whole video just to draw a weenier.
The water physics are so bad that a few overlapping square spaced walls would do way better than this.
I know your a engineer but in my school we don’t call that bracing walls we call it a Co ck and balls.
Ummmm sooo, anyone gonna talk about that shape 💀
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I COMMENTED THIS IN THE LAST ONE YESSSS!!!
At 9:45 I feel like you forgot the game is 3D not 2D, While yes the velocity of a fluid with a fixed density and temperture will increase if area / volume decreases the issue is in this the water increase in internal pressure expanded upwards not just outwards - so you lost some of that pressure to the vertical direction, not only that the area on the left is equal to the area on the right - you need to ensur it's narrow the entire direction otherwise the internal pressure of the water leaving quickly disperses/ drops off as it expands.   So don't forget;  - Game is 3D not 2D - Keep the left side narrow for longer - Decrease D (Distance from City to the pinch)  This should help - although not sure how you can cover things in Cities; skylines without filling it in.
He has child brain. But yet don’t we all?
5:25👀
Stagger them just like tesla valve
It would be interesting trying this with a more accurate Blender fluid sim. I might do that.
we demand a new video with the real tesla valve
Ayooo we trending boiss
Tesla valve doesn’t have a big gap in the middle
Louisiana needs to watch this
I'm sad to see how poorly designed this "Tesla valve" is considering you mentioned engineering programs. Hopefully you aren't an engineer
Ah yes,  the strongest shape is also the strongest testing platform
A tesla valve also works on continuous flow.... I think a continuous wave if possible would show different.
RCE: "I don't think you'd ever be able to get a game to run this in real time"  Two Minute Papers: "Hold my coffee"
The perp. "dam" will not hold at all! Save yourself the trouble of your hypothetical drawings. Just ask the Dutch! They really know how to do the math!
Homie your comments got lit the frick up
I feel like I’ve seen this design before.
You could probably cheaply test this design using water physics in Unreal Engine 5.
Tesla came up with the valve for use in a pulse jet engine where it only needs to block the majority of a high pressure spike from back flowing.
Show us again with a program that's that's much better related to fluid dynamics. Your idea is very sound though.
as soon as you added those circular things next to the valve it look a little inappropriate!
What a glorious question lol wait what microphone
My prediction is no edit: i am presently surprised i was exspecting city skylines water physics to not work at all with a tesla valve
Phallic much?
no need for 9 ads during a 20min video
Penius
Was going to point out a few things but people have already mentioned them this is not a Tesla valve .
I'm irrationally angry that he's saying tesla valve instead of a baffled suppressor. Which is what it is  (not actually angry. Just a bit of my nerd brain getting irritated lol)
This video got me watching Lesics' video the tesla valve!
You'd want to try this with a river or something, rather than a sudden surge of water (I think?)
I guess you could call it the tip 🤣
5:24 Dude, I know a dong when I see one.  Good job!  I hope the shape does not get you demonetized.
You are aware that tidal waves in real life get taller in constrained spaces as well...
Play the create mod on minecraft that would be fun
I was wodering through out the video, if you kept the valve the same width at the ocean side as it is now, but reduces the width of the opening closer to the city, would it have a greater effect?
0:04 "electiminaty" swear I went back 3 or 4 times to make sure I heard right XD
all hail nikola tesla lol
Experiment with the space engineers engine a bid. I bet you will like it
I am sorry, but isn`t that a silencer and not a tesla valve?
Why dont you run some of your professional software once in a while and show it off, it would be interesting
What would have happened if the center of the shaft had not been left wide open like that, but instead shifted the opening of the valves off center in opposite directions?
I'm actually more insterested in the secret phone call microphone, Where do i get one of those?
Doesn’t Bernoulli’s principle clearly states that as pressure increases, the velocity doesn’t change?
Pervert!
9:41 That can only work in an enclosed space and under a constant pressure. The games engine acctually made it look really realistic i've work at a breakwater/ wave breaker and the waves when coming from the side at an angle will gain height and "bounce" right back which means they would be joinning itself either the second wave behind breaking it or staying constant it all depends on the angle of which it hits. When it comes to an open space the only way to make water go faster is by using gravity/some kind of a turbin externally powered to make the water go faster/ or simply by wind but its a time consuming procedure as the wind only touches the waters surface and some time has to pass for it to really speed it up. (Sorry for my english its hard to explain it and having to translate it in my head at the same time) As for the tesla valve itself you didn't even replicate it as it should be when it comes to schematic such as the one you're showing every angle every "inch" matters and lets remember a tesla "Valve" is a valve which again is a closed space with 2 ends and it technicly works only with a costant water pressure, the first "squirt" of water will always come as fast as it was released before it hit the valve cause its the water itself stopping the water behind it  :)
i am actually going to do engineering in college lol
Great explanation of the Tesla Turbine and how it works...mostly.  Part of the genius is the fact that the effects multiply because the edges of each loop or flute if you will, align to the end of each opening along it. I think, you might be able to get away with less, by having a larger flute, where all the water diverts, and then is pushed back along the lines. If you have the save, I'd love to see a cost comparison video of each of them, or at least maybe a multitude of different tesla turbine designs, all along the beach, going gradually up the shaft and see which one or how much you'd need, to have it work.  Also, someone tweet this to the devs, so they can use this to make a better water mechanics engine. We all know death by poo mountain is what we're all here for in CS lol.
This is how suppressors for firearms work
5:24 lol totally randy marshed it
You sir achieved nothing then showing us how strange you are by drawing a cock 🤦 and doesnt have anything to do with a tesla valve
4:14 try making the double slit experiment
are there any good water physics games out there to try this out in?
5:46 Can we appreciate how he makes our days?
the tesla valve tested in the most realistic water simulator!
wasn't expecting to laugh so hard @5:20
Come on. Build an accurate Tesla Valve. This is what Nikola Tesla deserves.
Simply not a tesla valve, but this would definitely work with a decent flood wall at the end.
Well this was a waste of time
U didnt off set the flutes like a real tesla valve but it was close enough
boys never grow up – they just get bigger and wiser
You kinda made a suppressor at first
Tesla is one of the people of all time
Missed opportunity, At the very last part of the strongest shape it should have had a hole in the montain ridge, So when you water was all done goin in and out of your town, the water would be pushed out through that 1 tiny hole....  ;Edit: Oh NVM... jeeej
You need to occlude the centerline, and offset the valves.
8:58 in a real-life scenario, you would not see this much water get faster in a situation of THIS scale. a tidal wave that freaking big is already pretty much as fast as its going to get. when waves get this absolutely colossal, it takes *exponentially more* energy to make it go faster and faster, because its just such an absurd amount of mass it's not even funny.  as well, at least from my understanding, the general idea that water gets faster in a situation like this is assuming the water has nowhere else to go, but in this situation the water does have somewhere else to go, more up. in order to get more speed out of it, you have to have this area completely sealed so that the water has nowhere to go but through the funnel, which then pushes more water through it, because there is less water to push back in the opposite direction of the funnel than there is pushing into the funnel, thus faster because less energy is wasted on other movement.
5:29 really brux...brux it's a dang Tespenis....the best valve of all time...😅
That not
gw mh simpel liat k*ntol design enough to pique my attention XD
Nice attempt but its not a tesla valve
I feel like a wall would be more effective 🤓
I was waiting until he build the right valve design until the end~
Arms should alternate, there shouldn't be actually any visible gab
Instead of drawing a penis like you did, how about one that gets narrower as it gets to the city. Then we will see the wave forced higher and faster and hitting the city
Electrithity
Lol
Looks like a vein valve in the beginning
🤣 1:06 Is NOT a Pinch Valve (Its a Wafer type Single Flap Non-Return Valve at best, actually looks more like a inspection End Piece)..... my gawd is your editor an Architect or what!
Peen City
5:25 recommend
Imagine you see this on trending and get 5mins in and there's the strongest shape.... cracks me up
anyone else think that this looks like blood vessels?
Part of the idea doesn't work. It's supposed to create a bigger pressure drop on a continuous flow. Curving part of the flow backwards is the genius idea. It removes the pressure applied by that part and uses it against the rest of it. A water bender or Tai chi practitioner will appreciate that especially. Here the curving doesn't work. Even if it was shaped nicely, alternating sides and using enough room to curve backwards, it's energy would be directed at the water after the tsunami and the front wave would be unaffected.   What did work is the serrated ( sawtooth ? unsure of the translation) pattern. Basically you stop two thirds of the tsunami by cutting the sides of. The remaining third gets widened again, maybe doubling in width by the time it hits the next split. It doesn't go all the way to sides or you'd have reduced the water to a third again. But halving it a couple times sure is effective enough.   It would be nice to see a very minor pattern on the sides, like a few dozen steps reducing the water by 1/10th or less. Then you'd get a remaining amount of (9/10)^n, which becomes very small fast. With such a wide gap in between it would be way more effective than you guess at first glance.
You did it wrong. You wasted 2/3 of the wave's power by making the first obstacle a wall instead of a valve. Sad.
The valves are supposed to be staggered I believe.
5:25 Does NO ONE else see it? Or am I still mentally a child? 😭
waves does not move like this. natural ocean waves are not moving only in one direction. they moves in two directions at the same time. one moves forward the other moves backwards. that water is so fake. ocean waves are longitudinal and transverse at the same time. one part diverge the other converge. one goes outward the other part of the wave goes perpendicular. in this simulation the waves moves only in one direction at the time and then collapse eventually when it reach some resistance. real waves does not need any resistance to produce its behavior as its induced by a property of nature that is not based on resistance. those people that made that game does not know how waves really works.
for the "water goes faster" you forgot that wave diffraction also has an effect
0:11 possible face reveal
So translated into American, you created a suppressor…
XD that shape is a Lil suspicious
Here from the trend list. Pretty awesome videos dude.
My guy shows us an image of what tesla valve looks like but still managed to made it different from what he intended to by make it completely straight and symmetrical, that's next level of engineering.
5:29 bro...
This is my new favorite channel
Didn't finish watching yet, but I already see two fundamental flaws.  First off, the Tesla valve is designed to allow unimpeded flow in one direction, so building it on the river itself would've been the optimal choice.  Second is that without encapsulation it isn't really a valve, where the opposing flows intersect you'll get a spike in pressure and the water will spill over.
Love ur vids
You built it wrong
When you added the braces with the piers, you made a hairy peepee 😅
I like to think the creators of cities skylines see these videos and just think “we’ve got to fix that for next time”
“Invention of electricity” really dude, discovery and research not invention
Who else heard “Valve” n immediately think of Steam?
penis city
John at5:25
Ayo lil sus man
1:09 You forgot valve, the guys that made TF2 and Portal
Climactic to say the least.
It should really funnel it into the channel
Arrived here, watched until 5:26, checked the comments down and now I'm wondering how deep into fluid mechanics are all of you not to see that he drew a huge hairy dick, which is also something affected a lot by fluid mechanics.
Dude, that's an impressive desig.... WAIT, WHAT THE FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuu...!
best way was Front = High wall Middle = deep trench Last = do we even need that???  With high wall you defend from most of water coming with deep trench you defend from leftover water  Don't forget this game doesnt calculate the terrain destruction so for this game this was absolute answer to defending from a tsunami
Will a Tesla valve (cut down the middle) stop a tsunami?
To be fair, a tesla valve is one channel with partitions that feed back or forward on itself depending on the flow.  You created a giant, Johnson shaped system of baffles, more akin to a suppressor.  Try again.
"shows tesla design" Makes p p that has walls...
You definitely need a better physics simulation.
You had me at tesla valve
5:25
I'm just going out on a limb and saying the fluid physics in this game are probably not on the level to give an accurate result either way.
deam you RCE i whas happy not knowing how water dynamic work, now i'm all curious and with no good water dynamic program to test my theorys to satefy my curiosity i feal iritated.
as an engineer I can confirm said terrain bracing technique is tried and tested. 11/10
Laughed my ass off at the structurally sound edit with the "bracing piers", which we apparently see all the time in real life xD I know what you're talking about but had no idea what you were building up to LOL
could you redo this with a tesla valve
1:32 AT LEAST GIVE IT A [[bride review]]
Fun fact: without Aussies you couldn’t watch this because we Invented Wi-Fi
“His name inspired one of the fastest growing car manufacturers” which ironically is owned by the modern day equivalent of Edison
hey other subscribers, be careful, youtube unsubbed me from this channel when i didnt ask it to.
Civil Engineer’s sense of humour:🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆 in every city skyline build
Just found your channel the other day and have enjoyed making my way through them. I'm curious if you'd be willing to retry this one, with a more direct copy of Tesla's design. In his the "valves" or "channels" that redirect the flow are staggered, not side by side as in yours. Just curious as to how it might change things up.
Aaaand there's a dick. 5:25
The Tesla valve was Dysoning it up before Dyson Corp decided to leave away hitherto considered „key“ parts of devices.
Just ponder 5:23 for a minute.
NICEEE !!!!
OH, I LOVE THIS IDEA. You should check out Viktor Schauberger, he was an inventor who's every work was based on water physics. And he had some INCREDIBLE stuff that he came up with. I am sure you will be intrigued.
The intro alone deserves a like
fluid dynamics discribe a continuous flow of fluids. here we have a wave with a length in simmilar dimensions to the structures you bild. so its more like HF-electronics.
Well that's impressive
For the velocity to increase, your channel needs to have a "lid" to keep the maximum height constrained at a constant value. With varying height, the rate of fluid flow is still changing but it is doing so by a change in mass per unit length rather than by a change in velocity  The game is actually simulating correctly I think
For info: This are no tsunamis. Ingame they are called so. But they are only big waves. Tsumanis were waves with many km or sometimes hundred km lengh and so they are no wave for us, we see them as wall of water. And this makes them so dangerous. If they were a wave, we could build a wall or they will run out very quickly. But we can not, because its such a long wave, its more a wall of water and so they will also not run out. They will go so long on land, until they end or the terrain is higher than the waterwall. And your ideas are working with waves... but not if the game would simulate a real tsunami. A 400m tsunami for example on the east coast of the USA will not burst and run out. It will move till the appalaches hundred km behind the coast, because the flat terrain.  So yes, a tsunami is a big wave.. but much bigger and especially longer than in skylines and so many things work here, which will in reality never work.
Lol, "Bracing piers"
I think the water physics on this game only reduces the height of the wave when it spreads to other spaces when leaving a gap. You have 5 gaps by the end, so I suppose it would halve the height 5 times regardless of the shape on the walls.
Hairy balls...
As a fellow child (lol) im glad you saved Dixin City. XD
No importa el por que... no importa el donde... no importa el cuando... Siempre que un HOMBRE pueda dibujar, en algún lugar del dibujo siempre habrá un buen 5:23 xD
RCE please get extra landscaping tools mod!!!
Should’ve tried it with a slight incline and a bit thinner and where the water goes in and is meant to come out kinda flatten in to make an edge so water won’t push in both ways
Outside of the notated issues with the design of your valve, I would enjoy seeing you also remove the slope of the land to test the efficiency of the valve.  The city sits higher at the tip than at the base, thus providing additional resistance beyond the valve.
Make a artificial beach in this
Wait what? RCE is Top 50 in german trends 👍
Given how the waves work in this game, I think you could simplify this down to  just making a series of walls with a tiny gap in the middle. Each time the wave hits, only that portion of the wave makes it through, then it expands to fill the next area, as long as there is enough space for it to expand to the width of the tube, you can place another wall with gap to reduce the size again.
Its foi simetrical, put a offset on One side
Note that although the speed of the wave wasn't slowing down, the throughput was, because the height was getting lower. So I think the lack of change in speed is compensated for by the change in volume, whereas in a pipe there is a lack of change in volume.
Am here because of record of ragnarok
these are sick
with the tesla valve you want to go right left right left not directing it all through the middle
i wonder if tesla valve can in my ****. 🤔
Sweet. Now do it in Creeper World 4 ;)
Been watching your content for a while and really had a giggle with you "Jeremy Clarkson" inspired wave channel design. Also enjoyed the test. Would you try the test again and design the Tesla Valve though? The test, although similat, had the retaining walls mirror each other, which is not the case with the Tesla valve. It would really be interesting to see how the water physics  behaves.  Stay safe and thanks for the time you put into your passion.
you have not built Tesla valve. It does not look like this.
nice shape
In the diagram you showed in the beginning looked like the notches were alternating from side to side.  Kind of curious how that layout would effect it.
Something tells me this game doesn’t actually have fluid mechanics like simulating turbulence within the water body and instead just chucked a bunch of sine waves😭
You are on trending
Your so immature😂😂
Maybe I'm just a jerk but your build does not look like what I see when I look at the tesla valve, just my thoughts.  And I still would complain about the bad view of the ocean.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       !…
Aren't you supposed to offset the entrances of the Tesla valves?
This is cool and all but does skilines have actual proper water physics? Hm, looks pretty dang good though... Actually I dont even care if that question is answered honestly. All I want to know is what was that "secret phonecall microphone" device? That might prove very useful in loud areas, not so much a private factor.. Anyone?
Sadly you didn't make the Tesla valve
Imagine trying to piss...
Most people seem to have overlooked the elephant.
5:24 Wang Bob Twig and berries
Should have had all the roads and rails run out of the “tip” of the city. 👍🏼
a rifle supresser design would work pretty good
The Serb known as Nikola Tesla is an unparalleled genius. I'm sure that if the people he worked for did not betray him he would have slingshot us into the future another 200, maybe ever 300 years into the future as he did say confidently things that could be achieved such as wireless electric cars, planes and anything else that needed power. This I know to be true as making radio waves is the same as transmitting power since they are both in principle the same thing.
ribbed for our pleasurer?
Worst fucking Tesla valve, shame on you
Enyone notice the l4d 1 a valve on a head on 1:08
Reminds me of the science of a muzzle break
Jeremy Clarkson, I presume?
I hope not.
This is a little pointless with how it is located, as the whole point of tesla valves is to allow liquid flow only in one direction. However, if this was built in a canal, you could allow fishing boats to pass through. This could even be applicable in a real-world scenario where land needs to be protected from potential Tsunamis or water based natural-disasters, but has a high amount of boat traffic.
Lud bud
Loodwig
"I'll have to let the channel open so the water can flow out, annoyingly" * proceeds to build a tesla valve, which is literally designed to let water flow in one direction but not the other * * doesn't put it on the channel *
ludwig viewers here... WHOOP WHOOP
I'M A LUDBUD
7:12  uhhh hmm.
💉🫀💀💰👀
What a terrible civil engineer you must be, not even able to copy the Tesla valve exactly. Might as well be click bait.
Not a tesla valve
🗣 : Hello my fellow engineers!  Me : 👁👄👁
tesla having his name used by a scummy monopolist to sell cheap overhyped cars is nothing compared to literally being responsible for most electric appliances
Don't you need pipe or hose to use a valve.  You play too much games. :)
Testa-Valve™
Integza taught me about tesla valves, so no, I'm not surprised 😁
If you go to put down a dam it'll show you a water speed map. This will be very useful for demonstrating how to water works in game. C:
I love to see it. Thank you for reading your comments❤️
I was hoping you’d build the Tesla Valve in the river to keep the wave from flowing upstream but permit the river to flow.
Did I just hear "eish"?
I'm not an engineer yet I knew the wave would become taller. It's because water travels faster when it has no where else to go, like in a pipe. You're not dealing with a pipe though, it's a channel. Since it can go up, it does that instead. Another thing, a tesla valve won't work because it relies on particles interacting. Water in Cities Skylines are pure waves, they can pass through each other no problem.
I commentented in the previous video and still feel that creating a wall with like a half moon or curve back toward the ocean will stop the wave. So basically the wave comes in hits the wall and as the water goes up the wall, the wall curves back into the ocean.
thats not a tesla valve, thats more like a supressor
The Lesser Known Pingus Valve LoL
This games physics are nothing like real life physics
Its so sad his name is attached to that shit company
The Tesla vulva is very impressive
That intro was amaizing!! I thought I was watching a history documentary
seems like it would have been much more successful if you'd just not left the center line straight, the directional change seems very important to how the tesla valve works to me.
Tesla valve, more like testi valve… I’ll see myself out
This is how you should learn about fluid dynamics
Do you think you can mess around with the trains in City skyline and make something cool out of it please
Who cares. Things need wiping out and erasing. People also not need to live in fear.
maybe you can try that in timberborner, the physics of water are different there, if it gets a little narrower, the water flows faster.🤷‍♂️
Isn't the point of a Tesla valve to allow water to travel freely one way and not the other?   IE, in civil engineering, couldn't you use this along the course of a river to prevent backflow, like tsunami's, but allow the river to flow freely under normal conditions?   I kind of want to see you model that...
I too like to make my Tesla valves 8===D shaped.
5:25 amazing
If you add a 'Pack man.' You can gobble up all the water. Problem solved.
Petition to make him rebuild it exactly like a proper tesla valve (he built it wrong)
Waves are symmetric and coherent. The best way to counter that is the opposite. Provide a haphazard, non-symmetric, almost random path and the problem is solved. Like the incoherent path(gaps) of stack of rocks used to break waves in normal sea defense
What game do you reccommend me downloading
If the valves were offset in Theory they'd probably be more effective but nice idea still nature is ultimately unpredictable but sometimes energy or force can be channeled nice 👌🏾
I really like this idea, but that's not a tesla valve. It more resembles a suppressor. The main part of a tesla valve is that is doesn't provide a straight path to its destination, that it's forced to go down the loop path first. *for reference, the image that was used*
Humans didn't 'invent' mathematics or electricity, we just discovered and remembered them.
was wondering why there wasnt an opening in the wall behind the city, good thing you remembered
Tesla NOT going to save you from this rapture lol.
aren't they supposed to overlap, alternating left and right? i think the game would do even better that way, too.
The time for judgement is here. Repent of your sins while you can. Soon it will be too late. I have warned you time and time again. This time is the last.’
Sheesh cool
You could have moved the river into the tesla valve since the tesla valve only allows one way travel of water the river could seep into the ocean but the ocean would not seep into the city. Great video though!
This guy is obsessed with male genitalia. This channel has turned into a second hand dart board.
I'm surprised they don't have a water physics addon for this game.  They have addon's for literally anything else.  I bet if you search long enough you can find a cabs don't pick up black people 50% more addon.
gaming but make it ✨ educational ✨
around 16:20, i was very surprised to hear u explain something wrong ur normally pretty accurate, i cant remember any other time iv noticed that, im also no civil engineer expert so..   water speeds up in a small area, when its " "funneled from a larger area" "  not just if it comes from a larger source   it wouldnt speed up in that narrow branch   i just noticed u later also said, the wave wouldnt get deflected down both at the same speed in real life, it will tho man  in all actuality the wave will lag behind because it kinda had to make a turn, n it actually shows that, the wavefront travels as n arc, n that edge at the bottom of the screen is lagging the wave front close to the middle of the wave
5:24 XD
7:01 I can't believe no one is making fun of this shape.
You kept saying that the velocity of the water would be reduced, and while that is actually 100% true in a closed system like a pipe, there is no reason the water would slow down in a situation like this simply because it spread out. There is no pressure differential in this system, being open to the air, like there would be in a pipe. The momentum of the water should therefore carry it as fast as it would go until it is slowed down by the friction and absorption on the ground. It also wouldn't speed up in the narrowing channel so long as it has another direction to spread its mass that isn't forward... in this case up.   So in short, this simulation is even closer to reality than you thought, and most of the things you thought it would do are based on a closed pipe system that isn't limited on the 3rd dimension by only gravity.
I think the way this game simulates this has much more in common with the wave dynamics of light. You should make a diffraction grating or double slit or some other optical thing to see what that does.
Great Vid RCE!
Some people say that I never got over my obsession with Phil Collins. But take a look at me now.
I don't believe that is a tesla valve not exactly

look at the valve again... its not directly mirrored 😑 its an offset..  I thought you where an engineer... *shakes head in machinist*
ok so just to explain the game's water physics a bit (so you can abuse them better):  The game sees the water height as an X/Y grid with numbers on it. Water moves at a certain speed because that's the speed the devs have limited the math in the background to. Long story short, you can generally ignore speed in this kind of water sim, as it is constant.   What the game cares about however is volume. It knows there's a certain amount of water at an x/y location, and that it has a certain velocity (which is constant in this game as either moving in a direction, or not, in regards to waves). so you have the tidal wave map, lots of water (max volume) all moving in the same direction (all have the same velocity value). what the game does with this is for each 'square' of the grid it sees the map as (subdivided to make the math easier on your computer) it runs a check. "Do i have water" from there it checks "how much" and then check the cells beside it for where that water can go, biased by the direction the water is set to move in.   from there it can move a certain amount of water from each tile to a tile with less water in it. this is the speed limiter the devs have applied.  now when this hits a wall it knows it can't fill "wall" with water so it will raise the water height to a certain limit, based on how much water is behind the front of the wave. since the water can only have one direction out of 360 degrees, the game basically bounces it like a mirror would a laser. if two wave fronts collide, they will add to eachother, or cancel eachother out.  this is very rough in how it works, and i'm sure there's better explainations on youtube, but it should be enough to get the point across.
isn't the tesla valve some measure to allow a *_constant_* stream of water from one side, and cause a *_constant_* stream from the other to "block itself" by being forced to go "backwards" against the direction of the flow ? and that would even be better with a s-waving shape on the inside of that valve. but a straight canal along the middle is open for a single tsunami wave (the "turn back side channels" are just too long to have any effect on the single center wave that already went past), and thus that wave is only reduced by the narrow width and the opportunity for the wave to spread out every time, which has nothing to do with how that type of valve works.  to show how it works, you should build a river with a lot of constant flow (instead of a single tsunami wave) that goes through the valve. depending on the direction, the water should either flow almost unrestricted, and in the other direction it should generate lots of backflow and rotating currents that slow down the water flow and even (because of the general S-shape) force most of the water to go into the next "trap" where the same (backflow, rotation, etc) happens again. and thus in that direction, the water could no longer go through the canal "at full speed" but rise and possibly go over all walls.  as great as many other RCE videos were, and as nice this video is for showing something interesting with waves, as bad is this *_for demonstrating the tesla valve,_* not showing it at all :-( _just search youtube for "tesla valve" to see what it really is._
I did 2 bibliographies on Nikola Tesla.  Also day 14 of asking Matt to play more diplomacy is not an option
There's a mod you can download that gives you access to better landscaping tools. It gives you the tools from the map editor, meaning you can edit terrain faster, but you can also alter the sea level and place/edit water sources (fun!). I recommend you install it.
I heard valve and the fear of the bald man appeared and I just waited valve valve valve valve valve valve valve bald head valve and the i died
Looks a bit like the strongest shape…
I'm not sure if someone else already mentioned this, but I think the reason the velocity doesn't change in most of these cases is because you aren't working with a steady stream of water. You just have a single pulse of water, so there isn't much or any pressure behind the wave pushing it forward. It only has its own momentum. Also it's not enclosed, so it can go upward.
Does Cities Skylines even have an accurate fluid dynamics simulation?
why not just wall off the river spawn point
Fun fact according to the fbi Nicola tesla is from Venus yes official fbi records

Why that’s not ‘bracing piers,’ you have quite deliberately drawn a great big knob in relief, hardly what I call ‘civil engineering’! Tut tut etc.
19:05 just wait until quantum computing is available for everyone, games will be able to simulate so much more
5:25 you might want to change that
I realise it may not be possible in this programme, but what if you took one side of the Tesla valve and built it into the horizontal plane - ie. on the ground you would divert the water below the ground, around and out back into the wave, with several rows repeated - each effectively cutting into the base of the wave and redirecting it back. How many rows would be required to swallow the whole wave?
can you do another video doing an actual tesla valve? this is more of a baffle and im a little dissapointed
For the algorithm!!!!
14:48: Dallas drivers
Maybe look at a Tesla valve and actually build one. What you built wasn't a Tesla valve.
The flood wall is kinda sus

Nikola Tesla!!! My idol engineer/inventor since I was 10. And read his autobiography. Screw you Edison!
Prince Albert Station...
you did not make a tesla valve
You need to off set the left and right side
That moment when he tries to engineer a tesla valve, but instead architects a tall wall.
Yeah.. as a non engineer..  I was like.. what... Their are so many better ways to re enforce the 90 degrees bend... Lmao
Oh.. the Tesla valve... Let me save ya some time...  Yeah... Doesn't work.  Lol. Ok, so it helps to SLOW the flow A BIT... but that's about it.
Does he not know how to say the word... Electricity... Lol
Ironically, as you've noted in the past, you've perfectly illustrated that designers are not engineers. 🤣  Nice try at designing and failing, while literally using THE illustration. 😄  Somehow I see this as an attempt to set up a sequel video. 😆  I'm here for it though. 😄
OMG 😂
Love cities skylines! Awesome that you and it are being promoted
I can only imagine how high their insurance is in that city xD
2D solutions, 3D problem
I was burthed beside Nicola tesla and he started in the doctors face ngl it stank
Nice Video!
5:24 It looks like a dick.
Tesla valve, you say?  *Integza has entered chat*
day 49 of asking you to make a factorio serie,
RCE a true Tesla valve openings are off set which wouldn't allow ur simulated wave to travel all the way through and would work correctly I believe
I comented this in last video
Not a tesla valve..
imprest
I think you simply made some pockets to prevent the water from getting forward ^^ Nice video but your design is really poor this time.   You should have channeld all the water to the valve instead of getting rid of 2/3 of the full amount of water from the zunami
Nice for 12 on trending
many survived tsunami in Valdez, AK bcuz the inlet is shaped like that tesla valve. although i think asymmetry would help. I appreciate that the game moved sand with the wave.
That's a poor model for a tsunami. You're using a short impulse wave with a very narrow wavelength. A tsunami has a very long wavelength, frequently as much as 500 kilometers (300 miles) or more. As a tsunami approaches the coast, the front of the wave slows down, allowing the rear of the wave to catch up, building the height of the wave as it approaches the shore. It's why a tsunami can be a meter high in the deep ocean, but climb to 10 meters or more near shore.  The valve you use in your model would be overrun as well. As soon as the valve slowed down the front of the wave, the rear of the wave would catch up and spill over the top of the valve.
That's not a Tesla valve. That's a cockinballs valve.
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔴🟥
Looking at your use you clearly don’t understand the principle of it. First you left a huge gap in the middle. Second you are using current pressure of flow to deal with nothing as the wave is long past. Third you didn’t stagnate the redirecting walls.
I would love to see this remade in Timberborn. You can make a tidal wave, water speeds up in narrow areas, and The Beavels!
I think, that almost exactly the same amount of water from the initial wave will hit the city if you make a wall and make a hole the width of the narrowest part of the valve.
Ok, now actually make a tesla valve and do it again please.
"Tesla Valve" Me:OMG OMG ELON MAKING SOME VALVES OMG Also me:oh Nicolas Tesla
homie made it to the #8 in trending , damn .....
Tesla valves are staggered not parallel like in this video
the world needs all of what Tesla knew
The Tesla valve is under constant pressure. The tsunami didn't. Ur experiment sucks.
While I do agree with congratulating the game for even going this far with water physics which it completely didn't need to do, at the same time, that software you used costing absurd amounts of money to licence?  I don't think that really indicates anything, honestly.  Technical software tends to grossly overcharge.  A video game completely could do some pretty great water physics, if that was a thing it wanted to concentrate on, and felt like people would love it for.  That could totally be a thing.  Maybe it's not something you can use in a scientific paper, but it's the sort of thing the average onlooker couldn't tell the difference with.  Decent enough as this is for the game it's in, yeah it could be much better.  Just (very fairly for this game) wasn't something they felt needed anything more to it.  (although if they could go ahead and give me custom placeable water sources on console that'd be very nicely appreciated thanks)
The narrowing and widening of the tunnel wouldn't change the speed of the water in this scenario only because the added or lost pressure is absorbed by the empty space around the water. The narrowing of the tunnel showed this with the wave becoming taller. Whereas in a closed system like a hose, putting your thumb over the end of the hose would increase the speed because the only place for the pressure to go is still only out
matt literally makes everything possible the strongest shape in the world
the main thing is to insert the word Tesla. I feel sorry for you marketing victims.
This was really cool! If you were to integrate this design into Engitopia, I think those little quarter-circles on the coast with the reinforcing walls would be excellent places for mini architect islands *_~
what if you made a tesla valve but out of traffic and see how much it slows traffic down haha
Good job on keeping those architects down!
Came here to escape a day of Valves...
🧌
Matt, the Tesla valve is designed for continuous flow, not one-big wave tsunami...
I was thinking he should to a Tesla valve last video :O
ok ok hi like
two major problems:the physics of the game, the water isn't underpressure
This isn't really a Tesla valve my dude...
Stop applying constant flow concepts to a large wavefront, maybe your ideas would work on real tsunamis but this game is just modeling a wave function, does not seem to take turbulence into account.

I loved it when you actually taught us basic principles of engineering, before your channel became mainstream, so this was strangely nostalgic.  Don't get me wrong, I still like your videos, and what brings in the views for you can't be bad, but I sort of miss the days back in 2020 when you where at 100-200k and the videos where really interesting
For a not-Tesla-valve valve, it functioned exactly as expected.
@Real_Civil_Engineer What would happen if you pit 5 or 6 of thoes valves across the front? Can you improve on the valve design??
Would have been interesting to see 2 side by side in opposite directions to show the use of the valve (one way valve with no moving parts)
5:24 when you see it you’ll know. Lol.
You are not simulating a continuous flow. A tsunami is more like a transient event. I am not sure how well a tesla valve will work with those as well.
i don't know if you know the game "Scrap mechanic" but i think you'll like it
For some reason my engineering professor did not like my sketch of bracing piers...
Yes yes yes... All very impressive. Use the same materials to build a higher wall and forget the complexity of the Tesla design. Maybe a little more space also recovered to be useful?
You should have made a city at the entrance for the architects
I love how you used cities skylines as an alternative to CFD. If this game truly does simulate fluid dynamics to that level of physics (which I don't think so), I'll give praise to the game developers.
Nice d**k @RealCivilEngineer
The main reason why the wave isn't high is still that the town is a lot higher than the ocean - so the Tsunami starts alot deeper xD
Is there a fluid simulation game that people can get? I'd love to play around with stuff like this
The Tesla Valve is supposed to have the main path tilt back and fourth to the sides so the water gets set though each loop and not just have a giant hole in center that is completely straight
The tesla valve doesnt really work in real life. It restricts some flow, but no more than an standard bottle neck or low flow pipe.
I think the biggest thing you're missing is that the tesla valve is intended for continuous flow, so a single wave won't be affected nearly as much by the backflow.
?
Would you please try this in Timberborn? :)
Congrats on trending yet again, you deserve it for the awesome content!
It is technicly a silencer for waves
I'm kinda disappointed the tunnel isn't at the very tip. He could have called it the Prince Albert tunnel
I clicked without looking at the title and thought this was gonna be educational. Not to shame u it’s a great vid
That's not a Tesla valve. At best it more analogous to a silencer. Which absolutely is not a one way valve.
You keep saying that the water should speed up when the wave hits a narrow part of the channel. This logic is flawed. If you had a _closed pipe_ and no water around your initial "wave" of water, this would be true. In that case, there is a pressure behind the water, forcing it forward. Thus, as the water has nowhere else to go, the only thing the water can do is speed up. The energy needed for the acceleration is "stolen" from the water pressure, and acts a a resistance, slowing the total water flow.  In your case, however, you have a channel (open on top) and a single wall of water travelling through it. When that single wave meets a narrow part of the channel, there is little or no pressure behind it to increase the velocity. There is only the kinetic energy of the water itself. Instead of increasing the speed, the water piles up, as the simulation shows. So even if this is not a professional flow simulating tool, I think that the simulation is fairly accurate.
I find the strongest shape thing funny, but god do I hate the ball hair.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

"pretty much responsible for being able to watch this vide-" *my 12 year old laptop crashes for no reason*
Dark twist. He's also partially responsible for every electrocution out there.
I wonder if real civil engineer ever played from dust, that is a water physics game.
You sound drunk... on success. It suits you.
Seeing hes an engineer, why dud he build the valve wrong...
Fluid mechanics are just WILD
Funnily enough, the valve shown in the beginning of this video looks exactly like vein valves. The flaps are there to prevent blood from flowing backwards

Another name to add into the FlexSeal™ family of products!
I, for one, enjoy a nice curve in the shaft.
RCE is a genius just build a Tesla valve infront of every city wich is at risk of getting hit by a tsunamie
GAY
We're live in 3, 2, 1 and we are a go with the money shot!
With open bodies of liquid, games typically do not simulate the bulk movement of the liquid -- instead only simulating the propagation of transverse waves through a fixed medium. This causes the waves to behave much like non-relativistic optical waves.  Similarly, with things like pipes, games typically only simulate the bulk movement of the liquid and do not simulate any kind of wave propagation.
teslao
Well now we need to see how the Tesla valve works in Timberborners! It'd be cool to see since the water physics in that game seem top notch.
I find it funny that I never realized tesla cars are named after him it's fairly obvious bit I've just never put the 2 together for some reason until he said it at the start of this video then I go "ohh I'm an idiot" lol
This video would have been great when I was in college...
Real demonstration on how your D stops working
Gamer: "I want a rate of change physic where velocity of water increases as it's channel width decreases!"  Developer who just spent hours fixing a typo: "Let me just put that in the backlog..."
In addition to the wrong shape, the valve only works when it is filled with the fluid. This doesn't mean it can't deflect waves, but it's not designed for that I think.
"i dont think we'll get a game that can do it"  Careful what you say. As computers get more powerful, and games get more realistic, water emulation may peak in a game somewhere. Will it be good as your licensed program? Probably not for building dams and things, but it could probably simulate enough baseline physics to give a mostly accurate depiction of water

I believe it when you say you are a real civil engineer. Obviously, you failed mechanical engineering.  You need to look at your diagram properly. That's not a Tesla valve.
Without having seen the video i'm gonna say no. Not because it wouldn't work in reality but because of the janky water physics in cities skyline.
who told you that was a tesla valve ? that is a tesla water dissipater . a tesla valve  is staggered teardrops .
I think you may have an obsession
Are there any examples of this on rivers or similar IRL?
Hi bro 😁
I was hoping to see a Tesla valve, sadly, there wasn't one.
I see RCE's plan...he saw how the video got pushed to trending from all the comments last time. He does the Telsa valve wrong on purpose to get everyone talking about it in the comments. Pure genius.
Very much not a Tesla valve. Just a shitty facsimile.
5:22 well done sir. You made something spectacular...
Skylines water doesn't really adhere to fluid dynamics, i think it only has momentum and gravity working on it. You might actually be able to stop it by placing a few water outlets at the end of the ramp that just dump water down the ramp as an anti tsunami tsunami.
just found this on trending love it great vids
Suppressor
rad to see you trending
Gotta love the reference to Valve
2:16 RCE: Tsunami Me: *Thinks about the song named tsunami*
New rce viewers/fans believeng on his engeenering talk and bealeaved that the strongest shape realy is strong
How come the Real Civil Engineer never tried Space Engineers? It is in the name...
Try to make the biggest wave possible with a funnel lol
I'm surprised you didn't go for the Steam/Half-life Valve joke
Tesla Dic* better tittle
Yay, I comnented on testing the Tesla Valve on other videos. Loved to see it in action. (Though could be prettier)
I'm lernding
The reason that water flows faster through a narrower pipe is down to conservation of mass: dm/dt remains the same. Since your wave can get taller it doesn't need to go faster to get through the first valve with a constant dm/dt.
I graduated as more of an aerospace engineer but I always enjoy the more brainiac aspect of this channel
Also, the tesla valve works in a tube, not in a canal. Btw, the simulation DOES change the speed of flow of water based on the width of the canal, but only when the gravity is strong enough to keep the water surface flat, certainly not with a tsunami. And that's the same as IRL
GCSE results tomorrow. Wish me luck :P
Can you have a continuous flow of water?   Like 20 tidal waves.    I feel like its lost most of its oomph and cant deflect more water
At this point I'm surprised he hasn't made a city consisting ONLY of 'highly efficient' layouts.
Hey Matt you are one of my favorite YouTuber
so happy for RCE that these videos are doing well
Some things about how you build the Tesla valve versus how it actually works is the opposing sides are actually supposed to be offset for each other so is that the water doesn't get deflected evenly on both sides and results in more turbulent flow
A Tesla valve actually works with more Force so it might have actually been better to compress the entire wave down before it goes into the Tesla valve Maybe or at least more interesting
Time to see how Timberborn goes with the water simulation. >_>
Awsome
I came here to point out that he had an image of a tesla valve and still didn't make it but then I noticed there were a ton of other comments saying similar stuff so now I'm just making a comment to say hey, I too noticed that wasn't done right yay where is my super suit? I mean cookie...
The valves look like little hairs on the city penis
I would say I'm a bit of a kid-brain adult and without fail you always make me feel a little better knowing that an engineer loves to put "very efficient" shapes everywhere you can 😂😂😂 thanks Matt
Should have called the city 'Prince Albert' after what you did to the end of the tsumani defence with the roads...
5:24 ayo ??2?2
Looks like this game has turned into a dumb YouTube joke.  Glad I never bought it.
People depending on YouTube for happiness is pathetic and sad.
But Matt, you didn't build a Tesla valve. 🙄 What you built was symmetrical. 🤔 I don't know... Redesigning things to look better, he's turning into an architect. 😆
…It’s a wonder that young women often don’t feel comfortable in “engineering” spaces. 😒 Definitely not an inclusive video for all audiences, which is disappointing because it is an interesting subject and otherwise a good video
You made the "valves" parallel to each other. The actual Tesla valves are offset
Congrats! You explained how a suppressor works on a firearm. Well done
Where is the bit with a Tesla valve?
that look like a suppressor
I m only half in the video, but isnt a tesla valve more for constant streams than for waves?  Also would love to see a challenge for you where you have to stop a Tsunami with structures which are only half the hight of the tsunami A other thing you could test would be a curved structure, like nature before humankind made every riverstraight for ships and created floods when snow melts. But in general as its my firt comment at your videos. Im studing car engeneering and i just love your videos 💚💚💚💚💚💚 Go on like this, the combination of easy entertainment and still some education ist just perfect to chill but not be bored.
I feel like theres supposed to be an offset
omg it another tsunami vid
When after playing cities skylines in a few videos. He still hasn't installed a better world edit mod.
dude you rock
Yaaay I suggested this a couple videos. Im sure I can’t be the only one.
I learned how Tesla Valve Works with someone Messing with a game and Explained it Instead of Old Professor in Class  Peak Education Matt ILY
pretty sure the tesla valve is made for gas, liquids work on it but is still pretty inefficient, it still lets water out the other way
Obviously the water physics have some issues, but technically linear flow rate changes based on the cross-sectional area. So it's possible that since the wave height was changing, that it was actually accurately modeling flow rate
Lol,  a couple of days ago I saw your first tsunami video and thought: " hmmm is it posible with the tesla valve? " And know that!!!  Thank you!
People who believe in capitalist lies: "People won't invent stuff if we switch to communism because nobody would want to make anything without being paid for it"  Einstein and Tesla, both Socialist/Communist scientific ideologues: "Lol, lmao, pay? We invent because we want to improve life!"
Regarding water flowing faster in narrower channels: Bernoulli's principle only applies to incompressible fluids. Your tidal wave is not height constrained, so the wavefront is highly compressible. You would have to fill in a rigid roof on the strongest shape and prevent it from expanding when the fluid gets excited.
This one was a banger man😤❤️
btw if you want to play around with water physics take a look at creeper world 4 ^^
Not good engineer hahshs
💚
you can do similar on timberbourne in the map editor but only on a smaller scale
Tesla Valve, ribbed for pleasure
I love how the wall is just a dick
you're assuming the mechanics work correctly in game
Im going to University of Engineering but my parents wants me to the Draft Architecture College, I have no choice I have to choose architecture or else my parents will drown me

The moment i heard circular I knew it was dong he drew lol
Omg YouTube knows what I want and it scares me
GAY
If you open up the info tab and click on water you can see velocity vectors in the water, would be great to see!
Congrats for #9 on trending!
So the factor that the game was taking full advantage of which RCE was concerned about no overall change in speed was because the same volume was passing through, just with a different height. Had he had a way to force the height of the wave to stay the same it absolutely would do the exact things he described but the game went for the simpler option.
Day 9:Dear Matt,  I have a very good video idea  Gather all your editors and make them all have a fight on like a PvP game (e.g. Minecraft,Rust,Ect,ect...) And see who is the best editor and is worthy of the rank of a classified engineering. From me.
That was really interesting.  Are there any real life examples of a Tesla Valve?
Just had a Tsunami in my game last night, and these videos have been so helpful. I was able to put up some defenses, not enough to totally protect but enough to reduce the damage and although my city went from 7mil in the bank to 900K, the damage was light enough I could get people out of the rescue shelters and back to work and after a short while I was back up to 3mil in the bank.   Any ideas on how to deflect meteors?
you and i understand tesla valves very differently
I don't know why but the tesla valve you just built kinda looks like a cervix drawn as a diagram.
Velocity may not be affected however in a typical Tesla valve you also have it closed off. So the ONLY place the water has to follow is the valve channels. Also it can backflow on it's self. However in your case there's a lot of "air". So the loss of volume in your simulation is the amount of water that was pushed back into the ocean So the valve is working but instead of loosing speed your loosing volume.
you always have a way to get the most powerful shape ever, don't you?
When I hear "engineer gamer" this is what I think. Interesting (even though it may not be as realistic) to see what a Tesla valve could/would do in this scenario. Would LOVE to see of more of this but either way I love your content and appreciate all you do 🤙
The picture in the thumbnail isn’t a Tesla valve it’s just a suppressor
At this point you could just build a teardrop shaped wall around the city with the narrow part towards the ocean. If you made it long enough I suspect the water will gradually be pushed outward in a way that won't spill over the wall.
5:24 oh no, he just wanted to brace it
Ey! You're in Trending again, m8 (cool for you), keep it up!
Maybe using the real alternating valves?
What you tested here? Tesla valve or a gun silencer?
The shape……….
You made a baffle system not a tesla valve
It's good to see how much you've grown since the days of polybridge
More than anything, this is an exercise in how the gel physics of city skylines does NOT react like actual water
is this what's happening in your shaft when you get older and start shooting blanks? Asking for a friend
Ive been watching your videos for YEARS, and I’m glad to see that(for atleast this video) you can hit half a million views in just 12 hours, that’s insane!!!
The valve you did is wrong, it should be in a zigzag formation, with every side opening is locate in the half of other opening, as the current is not head straight, but force into every cornering side pipe and limit their speed as they continue hitting itself.
Canooter valve
Even if water physics of this game we're realistic I don't think it would behave how you might think. Textbook valve examples give the cross-section and assume the volume of the whole pipe is filled, whereas for this the wave can just get taller or shorter.
the valve needs way more consistent fluid to have its full affect
Squash at the wall
The peen joke got an instant sub, good job
Cô Mây hướng dẫn bài tết đong đầy đi ạ
Wow...you read my comment and do the Tesla valve...thank you
this episode is misleading. i wasnt expecting to learn how to make knob veins in skylines
#9 trending lets goooooo!!!! congrats brotha love ur videos
Why not try copying a firearm suppressor?  Their job is literally to slow fast moving fluids, the valve just seems like a less efficient method of the same idea.
I prefer the subtle dick jokes over the blatant "haha penis" jokes
You forgot to mention the valve his device was trying to recreate ... The CHECK VALVE. Typical civil engineer
If only the water physics in the game accounted for things like friction and viscosity.
What software did you use at your engineering firm?

Please redo this video with something that actually looks like a Tesla valve. You had the blueprint right in front of you.
love the strongest shape mixed with the Tesla Valve
I can’t believe you took my comment seriously! Love it!
instead of making a flat wall all the way across you could try a funnel shape leading into the tesla valve. it might stop it all
The water physics doesn't allow convergence/divergence to affect velocity, only height.
7:14 "We're nearly there" 🤨
The shapes in this video gets wilder and wilder
That's not a Tesla valve, but, hey - maybe you can buy some research material about Tesla with your ad sense from this video.  Congratulations on your clickbait.
How does an engineer mess up a project I made out of clay in the 7th grade.  All the solar engineers I work with f’ing know what they are doing and have no observation skills. I have no faith in our education system.
is that what I think it is, 5:25
7:26 Those taller buildings survived because they were designed by an ARCHITECT FIRM (VIA ARCHITECT FIRM), an *not* by an engineer.
Now I finally understand the Tesla valve. Thanks 👍
But… that’s not a Tesla valve?
Oi mat, there is an amplified disaster mod if you want to protect engitopia
5:25 no context
The rotation of earth really makes my day.
Missed opportunity for the roads….                Coming from the tip:p
Can you do some more Minecraft videos? Thank you!!
The third dimension seems to be an issue here. Also, need a way to look at the steady state and not just an impulse.
is that your 1st of April fools attempt ?
5:26 did not see that coming.
Tesla valve has it's inlets offset.
Tesla Inadvertently created the suppressor.
very much not a tesla valve.
I remember back what, like, two years now? I saw your stuff on poly bridge, and really liked it. Kinda stopped watching for a while, but I come back and now you're on trending? You're doing great and I hope you do even better!
just an excuse to make pernis for 20m.  :P
Aren't the valves supposed to be offset and closer to each other
man testing the accuracy of fluid dynamics in a city planing logistics game...
the best part of RCE'S videos is the bridge review or the strongest shape
Trending again 😄
Anh đức phúc hát hay quá 😍😍❤❤
As the video casually hits 9th on Trending-
It's really interesting how this turned out, however the offset of the right and left sides of the Tesla valve was missed in the design. I'm curious how that would have affected the water in this. I know in real world physics that adds to the amount of flow reduction, but how would it have gone in the game?
nice
I learned something. I feel a touch upset about that.
Its really not a worthy test, mind you- City Skylines don't have very good water simulation, and not that it needs it-  Mainly just that water velocity barely slows down, like as if it's consciously pushing against whatever it hits.
I think Nikola Tesla would be proud of this mighty strong structure that improved his valve design!
That was an incredible intro, just gotta say
Congrats on being on the trending list RCE :)
I think this engineer misunderstands fluid physics.  The speeding up of fluids as they enter a constricted space happen only as long as the fluid is actually being constricted. With your valve channel the water can still be raised up in level in response to compression.  This means your valve is working the way it should according to real physics while if this was water in a pipe with a tesla valve, it would have no room to be further compressed and thus speed up.  Basicly every part of this replaces increased speed for increased wave height.
I think the ability to move up and down accounts for the energy changes which you are expecting to be in the form of speed. When you are thinking the water should slow down it's actually falling down which turns into extra speed. When you think it should speed up it simply rises instead because the height isn't capped like in a pipe. That being said it is possible that in real life it should be some combination of both results
Your demographic targeting is spot on. How the hell am I supposed to pass on a video with a title like “can a Tesla valve stop a mega tsunami”  Goddamn
Yeah... Not a Tesla valve. A series of flat walls at the same points as the tips of your sloped sections will perform ~95% the same due to how water is simulated in this game. A narrow gap into an opening slices the wave in half, then it expands into the new space. Do that ~3 times and the wave is gone just like your "valve" does. If you shape them semicircular with the concave side towards the sea, then you will still get the neato deflections. This game's water system lacks a lot if you want realistic funsies unfortunately.😕
?????????
I'm so glad this series is trending! Your humor and wit need to be shared!! Oh and knowledge, of course!!!
The "narrow pipe flows faster" principle depends on it being a closed, full pipe. The speed increases because flow rate has to remain the same throughout the length of the pipe, so the change in cross sectional area results in an opposite change in speed because flow rate = speed x area. But the tsunami in your scenario has room to conserve flow rate by changing it's height - basically, the cross sectional area is allowed to remain constant.
You made the worlds first suppressed city
...yeah dude, if you alternate between left and right offsets I think it'll do a better job. But what do I know, I'm not an engineer, I'm a courier.
I would love to see how Timberborn handles the tesla coil. Perhaps in Season 4?
Tesla valve is not good at being used against 1 wave,  as you can see it reverses some water and its energy backwards and this water should collide with next wave and lower second wave energy. It can't eliminate stream completely but can significantly lower pressure on the end of the valve.
I love how dedicated Matt is to building penises into his videos! XD
oh wow I bought merch just before he made this discount code  well guess I'll have some more:0
Love these keep it up been watching since 500k subs
I'm so glad I found this channel, I'm learning so much. Haha.

#9 on trending. Well done Matt.
Love how he slyly gave a shoutout to valve inc 😂
Your Videos and commentary is so amazing, your videos make my day so much better.
Congrats on trending 👍
Congratz on the Trending man!!!
Who would win?  The power of engineering? Or The game’s wonky water physics?
Literally stop the innuendo
5:14 RCE: *Explaining engineering* Me: *Taking notes for college* RCE: *Reveals the strongest shape* Me: *Facepalms*
A plain wall is more effective.
I hope those ball shaped structures never bust.
You missed an opportunity to have the roads shooting out the tip....
TSUNLANTIS SHOULD SAVE IT AS
U did it the most innefective way
Made a water suppressor "silencer" with baffles and all.. brilliant!
If you make selfie toast. You're exactly what's wrong with this world
Basically a muffler that diffuses the velocity of exhaust. It results to a lot quieter exhaust but fairly expensive to make.
Can I have 30$
Isn't this missing the main factor that the Tesla valve doesn't have a straight path right down the middle?
Does this game not have a realistic water mod? If not someone need to make it for you
#9!
CIVIL ENGINEERING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m loving these City Skylines videos lately! I love how they’re not about you making a town, but doing other things in the game that people wouldn’t usually do. I’m excited to see whatever you do next!👍
Top 10 trending 🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥
Cities Skyline is the last thing I would think of when it comes to fluid dynamics simulations lol
419,986 views, 25k likes, 1k comments, 1.3M subscribers, #9 On Trending. Nice!!
would it be so hard to copy the diagram of the valve instead of making your own version of it completely disproportionate? The walls you used for the valve are the wrong thickness, the valve segments arent alternating, and the "curve" you added is too far away from where the wall ends, so it doesnt maintain the water pressure uniformly through the entire channel.
To all those dirty commenters, if you see a p3n1s that's obviously on you this is a professional channel and these are just commonly used structural marvels used by Engineers on a day-to-day basis 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Dsmn josy hdu hsabt uister?

#10 in Trending!!!  So glad to see your channel grow.
Its crazy how Matt is getting on the top 10 trending of all of youtube. Congrats!
If you enjoy these high quality videos with natural disasters then watch Sharknado, amazing cgi, perfect story, best acting.
@RCE, i saw the expiriment they did on the tsumani, according to their expiriment, the best thing do in that situatuon was to create multiple speed hump long the shaft and it will slow down the waves as it goes through the hump.
That is NOT a Tesla valve.
Is anyone else irritated that he doesn't use the real shape of a Tesla valve?  It's like a Tesla-valve knockoff......  It should have alternated the channels and loopy-bits from one side to the next with a lot more curve than he used instead of straight lines.  This video was technically just clickbait.
Every day I'm more convinced that you are too obsessed by the strongest shape. Stop it. Get some help.
How comparable is the water physics to real-life water physics properties
Love Sim City. Also, the Tesla valve was one of my favorite discoveries throughout studying electrical engineering and it’s not even an electrical principle. Hope this channel can inspire some people to become engineers and learn the laws of physics and see how engineering uses them to achieve impressive inventions.
You're so trendy, and you didn't even plan to be. Congrats, and keep it up. Cheers!
I think if he drew the balls first i wouldn't have noticed the shape
As soon as he drew that curve I knew it was going to be the longest and strongest shaped valve
It looks like a cross-section of a suppressor.
Such a strong shape
You could have made multiple valves next to each other
:)
Way to slip that one in
Nicola Tesla: one of the main contributors to the invention of electrithy, sort of…   RCE I love you so much, but it’s just nice to see people make mistakes. It just reminds me that despite how successful people are, we’re still human and are susceptible to making mistakes. I’m not dogging you for having an error in botching in saying the word electricity, I’m just drunk and it made me laugh.   Thanks again for the amazing content <3
Now do it properly with the arms of the valve alternating in length into the middle of the flow
The simple fact is your game doesn't have the Tesla Valve module installed.  You have to purchase that separately.
#9 on trending!! How you have grown!!!
Your Tesla valve design is trash and you should feel bad.
That looks sus
im personally offended as a mechanical engineer that you just said fluid mechanics is a civil engineers job
Tesla valve in Timberborn because water physics when?
I love that we get to hear you say valve in this like in Infra 🤣🤣🤣
you got me with the stuff about bracing piers, I didn't realize what was happening.
How did i know that when he rounded up the top he was going to make a D***, ive watched to many of his videos....
This would probably work even better on the river
I don't have the math to back it up but I think you may be giving the simulation too much credit. You got this wave of a certain height and when it passes trhough the first slit, it spreads out in a semicircle and the mass that the height represented is also spreading out so when part of that arc-shaped wave hits the next slit, it's that much less and then spreads out in a semicircle and so on.  So sure, after taking a quarter of the wave and a quarter of that wave a couple times, there's much less left.
But you didn't make a Tesla valve? Lets see a real Tesla setup.
HE GOT THA BASS PRO SHOP
yes no.9 for trending lets goo
heloooooooooooooooo
Can y’all show my friend “DirtInMyBeer” channel some love? He’s been going through a rough patch lately and y’all would make him smile😊
I thought a tsunami was not a wave but more a long period ocean flood.
5:23 yes, I am childish. Hit the like 👍
this is how car mufflers and gun suppressors work
good luck on youtubes trending list love these videos cant wait for more.
Nice
Idea: a Tesla valve shaped road. See how traffic flows in that!
You can use the water info panel to see which direction the waves are moving and at what speed!
I'm this game water physics has a terminal velocity
I need to make a model of this to test it 0-0
I actually made a really effective one at home! It was really cool! Such a fun project!
Great interpretation, but not really anything like a Tesla valve.
It still blows my mind that cities skylines is still making noise after all these years! Proud of this amazing community
You should build the city below sea level and use the tesla valve to stop it. It should also prevent the wave from getting smaller as it moves inland
Remidner that all those hydraulic theories (the ones you're thinking of, I think) and tesla valves are for when it's a tube that is filled all the way, without a vertical dimension for the fluid to go when pressure builds up. That's why the velocity isn't changed much; water surface wave group velocity is only roughly dependant on the depth, not wave amplitude or whatnot.
Love your videos keep it up
The problem with this plan is Matt is treating the water like it is in an enclosed tube and not as a wave in the open. It does obey normal wave/water physics when you think of it like that.
Congrats you just re-discovered the suppressor.
The first "funnel", as you put it, that you built was not accurate. It would speed up as it went through the funnel, but at the opening the volume increase. This means you built an Orifice. In engineering school you should have learned (but probably forgotten unless you use it frequently) is that you created an expansion device. Restrict the flow, then allow it to go back to the same volume as before means the pressure decreases and speed decreases between the start of the orifice and the end. (in the middle of the orifice the speed will increase)
And this is why you'll never make it as an architect. You can't even make a simple tesla valve. I'm just joshin
“It’s not like a normal valve that doesn’t have space issues” This single statement may have triggered submariners young and old.
This dude gave the in-game giant pepe a Prince Albert  ouch
Oh yes, one of the 3 good things that Serbia made Nikola Tesla, Novak Djokovic and Nikola Jokic
That's not a proper tesla valve.
how to gets this map plz tell me
maybe a canal to deal with the residual flow after your valve mock up?
This isnt an accurate Tesla valve.  They off set on the middle. Some what staggered
I've literally been thinking about this exact thing since you've started this series
Hello RCE! Ive been watching your videos for a long time now since my teens, know as an adult i work at an engineering company that inspects bridges! Granted im not the engineer, but it a start
Use attack on Titan City design to stop the tsunami
You're genuinely hilarious, just found your channel and instantly up there with my favourites thanks for the laughs.
how about pumping a deep hole in the ocean (not a wall but a single big hole in the middle before the tsunamy) in theory that should remove the entire tsunami before it ever reaches land, i know it's not very engineery, but i think it'd be fun seeing how the game handles that kind of water physics and you'd probably find some way to include a couple round things with a stick or something
Wow I wasn't expecting it to work as well as it did. Pretty impressive
Play the theotown it's a great city building game which is pixel-based
Matttttt help me with my homework
Bloody love your content Matt. Thanks for all your content. Especially city skylines stuff. Always makes me laugh and relaxed. 🙌🏼
the strongest valve...
Aren't each effect tunnel staggered from each other?
This is probably one of the most epic intro, rce has ever made
Actually forgot this is an RCE Video, I didn't expect the strongest shape, and there is a lot of people behind me watching T__T
gooj dma
Mmm yes Cities: Skylines my favourite fluid simulator…
This tsunami map is definitely matt's favorite thing about this game
This feels like an Integza crossover
shamelessly stealing that valve chart, i work in the chemical industry and thats gonna come in handy if i need to explain Something in English
You made suppressor baffles not a Tesla valve
When RCE starts teaching fluid dynamics by using rifle suppressors.
Lol
Dude, how did you look at a Tesla valve and then produce that filthy imposter shape instead?
You may have been an engineer, but surely weren't the one to engineer within design. That's not a tesla valve 🤦‍♂️
I wonder, is it possible to make a mod for this game to give the water more realistic physics?
5:28 looks sus
TRUSS ME IM NOT AN ENGINEER
thanks mate, I've learnt something
Recently found your channel and love it.  Could you make a tesla vale where there isn't a direct central channel, but instead a channel that alternates between left and right channels (staggered as such)? Hopefully you know what I am referring to!
7:00 hmmm this is sus enough for me
Definitely not a Tesla valve. Tesla would be so disappointed.
Granted, I'm asking a question that only here relates to game physics...but, does a tesla valve require constant pressure to see a drop in pressure. It seems like there would be a quick "spurt" from free(er) flowing fluid before the pressure obstructions occur. Is that the case?
10:40 ish there is no pressure so the water will not speed up instead it will force most of it back to the ocean and the remainder nder will dispurse as it masses the tiny gap.
you should do a final version of this where you merge a couple of techniques.
Dude pronounces electricity like twizzlers
I thought it only works on pressured close flow, like in pipe
Double slit interference in cities skylines?
I'm doing my part!
dude... the flow is the velocity of the individual water molecules. they don't speed up.   The pressure changes in the tesla valve, which means it gets higher elevation (moves towards lower pressure).   I can't believe YOU are the engineer here..... :/
i have heard NOTHING of this tesla valve until action science labs (i think thats his name) posted a short like a week ago, now i only hear about it
RCE can no longer stop making tsunami videos, he is already addicted to this
5:24 this shape looks vaguely familiar to something, I just can’t put my finger on it.
i bet you he wont like this comment on this amazing content
The Tesla valve redirects air back onto itself to make a lot of resistance and turn the air’s own energy against itself if it is going in a particular direction through it
that was really cool even if the physics weren't 100% realistic
19:13 your CFD simulations only took hours? Rookie numbers Motorway Matt. Rookie. Numbers.
The "Tesla valve" was actually invented by T. E. Slaughter in 1877. It had nothing to do with Tesla.
I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH!!! dont stop!!!!!!!!!
You said that it only works for a small area, but you could definitely use a whole bunch of Tesla valves working in parallel to protect a larger area
ah yes, the strongest valve
If you made the two sides of the valve staggered and overlapped it would probably stop all the water (more akin to the original design)
Sorry to say this but that was made for a pulse jet engine… for air intakes, not drainage…
Not a Tesla valve 🤣
someone please make a RCE building knobs compliation
Testing a Tesla valve using the game with the worst water physics ever. Hooray.
I notice that unlike a traditional tesla valve, you built yours fairly symmetrical, though I doubt a proper offset from one side to the other would have much if any effect given the flaw in water physics you are dealing with here.
Tesla valve does not really have a straight way from one end to the other. It has alternating obsticles on both sides, where the «main» funnel of liquid will split and collide into the other paths, slowing it down even more. What was made here was basically just a way to make the wave lose kinetic energy by using stop gaps.
i would use a mod called more landscaping tools to help you make these faster
I have no idea what a Tesla valve is, but I DO know that looks a lot like a gun suppressor cut in half lol
I wonder if there should work in a river that experiences flooding to stop water from turning back around
This is cool. The tsunami went from, Holy shit we're all gonna die, to meh, just some minor flooding, no difference than Australia during storm season.  This would be cool to see in action
Tesla is not a car company they are a data company. Every thing you do in that car everything you looked up every inch of road you drive is recorded and that data is sold off to hundreds of companies who make money to a very degree of ways. It’s not a car company it’s a data company
I was thinking at first you were going to use the roundness of the base to shoot the water back at itself right at the opening .. but nope hahaha .
The velocity of the water would only change relative to the volume so when you have a smaller volume going through a smaller gap it wouldn’t affect the velocity. But the same volume through a smaller gap should affect the velocity.
you should do a tsunami test in Timberborn!
Aren't the Venturi tunnels meant to work only with gases? Gases can be compressed or can expand, unlike liquids which can't compress or expand. In my thermodynamics classes we study that for jet engines and a nuzzle at the exit of the engine will affect the speed of the exhaust gases and the pressure of those gases too. If you can't change the pressure of the fluid then you can't change its velocity too otherwise you're messing with Bernoulli's principle (at least that's what I think I remember lol). Fluid dynamics studies both gases and liquids which kinda bothers me because although some things work for both, other stuff, like the Venturi effect, works only with gases.   Otherwise great vid! Always enjoy watching you!
matt, you WILL get games that can simulate it in real time.. Unreal engine 5 has an amazing water physics pack to it for a few hundred quid.. simply amazing what it will bring to gaming possibilities.
You didnt make a tesla valve.... you made a firearm suppressor....  a tesla valve redirects the fluid back on itself, this merely allows expansion of the fluid through reduced openings....  and the water seems to be behaving properly, in a restricted pipe with no other options a fluid will speed up as you stated, but in an open environment it will merely expand into easier paths...  You made a suppressor though, which is an excellent way to reduce the intensity and power of a wave ~another real civy
I always find it interesting when you give us all that knowledge about engineering with examples using games. Thanks a lot for enlighting us.
Bring back fly corp
Your valve was built wrong. It should be straight through.
That valve was ribbed for Matt's pleasure
Why can’t I get enough of the Mega Tsunami Series lol peace love and deleted bridges
I can't believe I didn't see the strongest shape coming, of course they were balls!
Tesla was a hack
you should play terra tech so i can watch you solve the problems i cant
Hmmm, given the game physics, what about something like a sink's waste trap to stop a tsunami? Given that the game keeps the speed constant, the water might have trouble going back to go further forward, even if it'd do it in real life.
Why not put a wall
🇷🇸
you should try the ps4 version
It’s not a Tesla valve tho it’s not offset and that’s way it’s not slowing down
Stagger the valves
Thanks for proving that tsunami are stored in the balls
I actually was aware of Tesla's contributions to hydroelectric power. Granted I do live approx 25 minutes away from the Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant
Next time, do this on a larger scale.  Either the full width of the valley, or have a bunch next to each other.
I'm not sure the Tesla valve works the same way with open channel flow vs pipe flow. The speed of the wave doesn't slow down because the height (pressure head) goes down instead of the velocity head. Though realistically it is working to slow down the wave, but not sure more effectively than just sequeezing down the width of the channel and putting in a disturbance to act as an energy loss. Essentially you are back to the isolated wave breaks like you'd have to reduce energy at the end of a spillway.
Invention of Elegdrisee? Dont drink and narrate :)
You can test if the game was modeling the interference by diverting the flow from the off shoots and leaving only the flow from central path
I feel like inversed half size would achieve better results
9:27 one thing you are confused about here is wave propagation is not a steady state condition such as water continuously flowing under pressure which would increase as the pressure dropped and width of the channel reduced. However, steady state conditions are not the situation here as waves behave differently then steady state flow and cause reflections which is what you are seeing. the model in this game actually look very similar to real physics which is understandable as waves are not a very difficult thing to simulate. The propagation speed of the wave would certainly not change as that is an inherent parameter based on other factors such as viscosity or pressure which are constant in this simulation. what you actually created here is an impedance mismatch so some of the wave is reflected backwards toward the source with the remainder continuing which is why it was smaller coming out of that channel and had a similar effect regardless of which way the walls were sloped. You can also clearly see all the reflections in the smaller waves that are all spread out instead of being concentrated in one large wave which is why the height was so reduced so actually this method of creating just a bunch of funnels in series would still reduce the energy in the wave propagating through as they would reflect energy back toward the source at each stage.  and again at 13:36 that is very realistic since that center part of the wave remained unobstructed through the entire channel so why would you expect it to slow down? Again the speed of the wave remains constant but the energy is being reduced since must of it is reflected back toward the source.  you could retry this experiment with steady state condition i.e. a river but I suspect it still will not work because this is not a tesla valve since tesla valves are fully enclosed so pressure can actually work. Instead what would likely happen is since the flow rate of the river would be constant instead of the pressure being constant then it would just force itself over the walls as it is not enclosed, but it would be interesting to see what happens anyways.
Why did you make a thing
Hhahahahha i was going to tell you to do a video using Tesla valve technique, predicted
Cool #9 on gaming trending
ENGINEERING IS JUST PHYSICAL SCIENCE!
SRBIJA DO TOKIJA!!1 😂
Sup
Funfact, the T on the Tesla does not mean Tesla!
I don’t see how splitting water from one large hose to two hoses of equal total volume would increase its velocity.
Real engineering attempting to apply constrained flow concepts to a wave simulation
Seeing the original wall deflected the S.. wave, should the complet "original wall deflecte the wave without needing to build the extended Tesla valve?
tesla valves are more of a zig zag configuration with loops at the bend point of each part on alternating sides, rather than the straight valves you did.
this is a comment about the video
Aw I fell for it
Remember we don't even fully understand fluid dynamics irl never mind trying to simulate it
Best way ever to learn water physics tbh 😅
I like valves a lot.  I appreciate this list of valves.
Is it just me or does it look like a, You know what😈😈😈
I wonder how well this works on a small scale, using the constant water source like they are in rivers in the game. The Tesla valve is not really meant to be used with "impulse response" source anyway.
This one earned the sub for me. Love these videos. What happens if you add some vortex generators on the beach head? Or just below the normal water line on the beach?
See what you've done there is create a visual of how erections work.
@1:00: A backflow preventer value.  It's used in fire sprinkler systems. :)  Also used in plumbing systems too.
@5:10…. “Because I’m an engineer” 😏😂.   I think your channel’s description is more accurate 😂😂😂
Proof that water is not stored in the balls
Love how you showed a tesla valve numerous times, then proceeded to ignore the basic geometry of the valve. 3/10 youtubering there
“The cities completely fine!”    All the small houses and cars, “ Are you a joke to me?! “
Sorry guys but this resembles more a sound dampener the a tesla valve.  You need channels of different width and stacked rather than parallel to each other...
Hard comparison of a flow valve vs tsunami protection. One has constant pressure and flow, creating ideal conditions for control valves. Tsunamis are tsunamis
poggers
Heheheha
I don't understand why you didn't just build the entire wall at 3:50?
You actually need to make a hi-vis vest with Bridge Review printed on it... That would be cool haha
it should have been staggered and stepped.. zig zag just like the patent. Shouldn't be able to 'see' the ocean from the city XD
That isn't a tesla valve. A tesla valve doesn't have a straight channel down the middle. The principle of the Tesla valve is that the water would need to continually bend to get through, where it can either continue "straight" down the channel which gets turned back, or need to turn to go to the more direct path.
Its not a valve, it's a handwheel!  Oh wait, wrong video.
Me thinks you need better water physics lmao
You made less of a Tesla valve and more of a silencer.
I love how one could've just built a high enough wall to keep every drop of water out of the city and still would use less material then Matt. I get the point of course but it's hilarious
does it not slow because there is no tube? or constant pressure?
Am I wrong or did you take Nikola Teslas valve and make it a cats barbed penis
Yup, classic engineering bracing piers 👌
Where do I get that toaster?asking for a friend.😄
You should make more appropriate sized silicone molds, convex and concave versions, of the Tesla valve and sell them on your merch store. Ones to stick in the bedside lamp table drawer.
Premature inundation is kind of a theme isn't it?
is this how vasectomy works?
Matt for the love of god get the Extra Landscaping Tools mod
all valves have moving parts.. except the company. you ever heard of Valve time? 2 months= 20 years
Glad you're trying this out I wanted to recommend trying a tesla valve the last time you tried to stop the tsunami, but I straight up could not remember what it was called
Missed opportunity to run the roads and train lines from the end of the canyon, instead of from the sides. Thank you for the fun video!
Electricity was discovered not invented
So did RCE just teach men how to last longer
nikolai tesla is my hero, except the crazy weird part at the end. he got weird :(
Matt, your website for buying merch kinda sucks..... Especially when trying to use Paypal.
Fun concept, but it's important to note a tesla valve only functions in a state of constant flow (river). Bursts of flow (tsunamis) will struggle to simulate a tesla valve response.  Mostly just commenting to show support.
As soon as you rounded the end, i knew what you were going to do
Loved this video!
electrility
huh... the Tesla Valve looks like the inside of a Suppressor.
your shit is such A grade intresting stoner fodda fully aprove 💯
1:08 list of valves
Glad I don’t have a Tesla valve down there, imagine peeing with that.
So a Tesla valve is designed to work in a system where you have water flowing through a pipe, and you want the water to flow one way but not the other. In a case like that, the water is likely being moved by a pump, which creates pressure (or said differently, adds energy) to push the water in the desired direction. In the case of a wave, the mechanics are completely different. Here, most of the energy is actually used to move the water particles up and down. The illusion of the water "pushing" toward the shore is the same as watching a crowd of people "do the wave" in a stadium; no one is actually moving from their seat, but you still see the crest of the wave travel. The game doesn't seem to recognize that the tsunami will dissipate once it hits shore and literally runs out of water to make waves with, but it does seem reasonably accurate with how the waves reflect, diffract, and lose energy as they hit a barrier.
Really the pine
i m thinking ab becoming a engineer, should i become a civil or mechanical engineer? (taking all opinions)
This guy over engineering: Me just not making s hole in the wall:
He literally drew a dick and balls and said "this is engineering." Incredible. This is the immature and intelligent content I subscribe for.
Fun fact: high flow baffled mufflers use this same principle.
pretty soon you'll be streaming COMSOL
I'm never going to get bored of the strongest shape. You never know when it's coming yet you ever overuse it. It did make sense to me until I saw it and then I was giggling like an idiot. never change!
Those buildings that survived were some wonderful erections.
RCE can you play scrap mechanic it is a fun Engineering game about creating cool things
Makes sense. There is a little bit of crossover between how electricity and fluids work.
Croatian looking like whattt
I'm curious to see one where the baffles are offset. Maybe I'll build a model...
Looking at the two angled walls, getting rid of the water, I think I figured out how the water physics work that are so wonky; there isn't actual pressure on the wave from the water behind it, pushing it forward. IRL, the whole of the water behind the wave would still be impacting it, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of "weight" to the water, so when it hits the 2 angled walls, it pushes that water at a very acute angle, simulating the physics, without the water behind continuing to push it. I don't think I am explaining this well, but essentially, the water that doesn't get forced forward instead goes back towards the exit. Water seems to be able to flow back THROUGH the water flowing forward.
You should find another game with better tsunami and water physics. It would look so much more satisfying.
Small note for you if you don't mind, individual curves of the tesla valve are supposed to be offset, not mirrored on each side, and it's more effective against a constant flow i.e. the river not a single tsunami.
Play satisfactory. You wont
I love fast cars so fluid dynamics is my favorite science.
Physics grad student here: I've never heard of a Tesla valve even after taking thermodynamics. Is that something only engineering classes would talk about? LOL
Love the channel!
728
How about making the water passage offset for the next video?
I feel like those bracing piers might not be a real engineering thing.
ok, now I have to demand basic microfluidics, or in this case macrofluidics. (Science puns go brr)
Hoping this expands into a series of other disaster
So the Tesla valve is responsible erectile disfunction
It looks like avacado
You should play some kind of fluid simulator
Today i got into a bit of an argument on discord about buoyancy and at some point we got to the point of the other party claiming that a lead ball can never float I then replied to them by saying that it can aslong as the weight of the ball is equal to the weight water it displaces that can be made posible by filling it with air. They then told me I am an idiot what is your opinion?
Tsunami map is a growing favorite of mine
Sussy anti tsunami
Hi man could you please make a new universim vid I really like your content especially that video:)
Bernoulli!
This is the kinda content people are here for!  Using your engineering prowess to not only teach real-world ideals but also with your creative spin on it.  And of course, showing someone doing something they do irl but they're doing it for fun?  That's when you'll get the strongest shapes ever when life's too serious to not allow people to be silly without judgement.    Ever going to get back to Freeways or did you complete all the levels?  That series was my favorite of yours.
5:04 "One thing I wanna do, just because I'm an engineer."  Oh, we know what you're "engineering" all right.
You can add an island at the beginning of the shaft, for more efficiency
This was so much effort to have an excuse to make the strongest shape ribbed/veiny.
I love your work!
Nikola Tesla: *Creats Tesla valve* RCE: *"let's use it to save a city!"*
nice "not Tesla Valve"...
The water physics in this game are crap. Also the tesla valve does not have a straight hole through the middle...
im surprised you ended up not making a tesla valve...
Love it calls It a Tesla valve then doesn’t make one great one Matt
A storm drain at the edge of the city would completely capture the residual water. And probably helps with the strongest shape. lol
CHILD! please make this test "fair". Your past tests are at the beach level (basically), where this city was substantially higher in this test.  It is better to at least level the pad to where you were before so you can ‘compare’ tests.
Tsunami!
this is not really a Tesla valve if there's a direct path for water to take to the city, it should alternate left to right as in the illustration
Looks like their using a simplified wave mathematics and ignoring a decent chunk of fluid dynamics. So it's more like a model of sound waves or something.
The engenier is better   -truless architect
You should have allowed in more water at the base.  That would have given your tsunami more energy & volume, the channel was rather long and the tesla valve was too far towards the city.
Shoot, there's a dev team that just watched this and are gonna release "water physics simulator" next year 😂 we don't need no stinking $2000 simulator system!
You should take a closer look what a Tesla valve actually looks like. The loops on both sides should be offset.
Amazing piece of work! Still waiting for u to turn this tsunami into a wave pool 😛
Use tsunamis to conduct a double slit experiment
Found this channel on accident, been obsessed since
Good video keep up the work😁😁😁
Need "can poop stop a giant tsunami"
Reminds me of rifle sound moderator baffles.
5:25 what the hell
This guy is inspiring me everyday to be an engineer
Hey I also have a map that you like Real Civil Engineer. It’s this piece of land detaining (hold back) a giant sea. If you want the map it’s called Milcana Atoll Taxhaven Exile.
The tsunami physics are different to normal water physics and there is a mod on the workshop called water spawner and read the instructions
Correct me if im wrong but is this not like Almost the Same concept how Supressors work? Because they have like those small things to Stop the Gases from comming out so, this thing (if you take it rough) is a Massive Supressor.
So what I'm hearing is that we can't try to recreate this experiment with beaver technology? The mention of water physics made me think of how timberborn has some pretty good ones, and now I get to wonder if how it would measure up. Very fascinating video, though, I was not aware of the tesla valve!
So THIS is what civil engineers do? Muck about with a genius idea and straighten it out, just a little bit, thereby completely removing EVERYTHING genius about it? Now I do hope that architects will do a better job at it than a real civil engineer. Because architects have to be able to follow plans, instead of trying to improve on perfection. 😁😁😈😈
Aren't the loops where the fluid turns back on itself supposed to alternate between one side and the other?
The angled walls at about 10min is how a suppressor for a firearm works. The baffles slow down and dissipate the blast so less comes out the end
Maybe a stupid idea.  In the first  blockage  1 or 2 small pipes or tunnels so the water don't spill over?
I had a tough conversation and this video really helped calm me down. Love a virtual tsunami.
I am so glad you're doing well here on youtube! Love watching your videos, keep up the good work!
Imagine someone going on the hashtag tsunami and seeing his vids
OMG, I commented this suggestion haha
not dissing any other youtubers. but I find rce muuuch more entertaining then LetsGameitOut and GrayStillPlays
History lesson:Tesla was born in Serbia
That's probably more of a suppresser (or silencer as it's sometimes called). Tesla valves loop around so they hit each other, as opposed to there just being baffles like a suppresser would have.  Edit: I don't know why, but the loops being kind of hidden by the straight lines messed me up because normally the loops kind of go away from the main line of what the "pipe" would be, It just looks more like a suppresser, but it mostly acts like a tesla valve (or it would act like one, if the water physics worked like actual physics). The main thing is in the actual tesla valve the loops aren't right by each other, they are alternating, and there isn't a hole going all the way through in a straight line, I don't think.
I totally didnt expect the structural wiener lol
Pretty sure teslas was offset on each side
Offset the valves on each side for better results so they are more like a Tred on a tractor tyre
A normal tesla valve has a roof so the pressure pushing the water up instead pushes forward that's what speeds it up irl.  The fluid isn't under pressure since it's not in a tube, so making the channel much less effective. (Though since its not a real fluid sim who knows what would happen in game.)
i love that mat explains it thats just me but i think it makes the video beter
bro do you read my mind? I asked this myself yesterday
Two problems with this simulation: (as you say at the end of the video) 1. A tesla valve works against a constant flow of water. This wave is a single narrow surge or wall of "water" (yes, with a secondary resonance wave behind it) which leaves a shallow film of "water" behind it that immediately starts moving in the opposite direction (receding). In order for flowing water to speed up as it gets constricted it has to have water pushing it from behind, which is not the case here. 2. (Why I put "water" in quotes) This is not a volumetric fluid simulation with all the dynamics of actual fluid. It's a particle simulation. Each particle has a local warping or "vertex displacement" effect on a 3D mesh "skin" representing the surface of the water shared with other particles. The particles are assigned physical properties like *friction, mass,* and *elasticity* to be effected by environment gravity and response to collisions with other objects. Particle *attraction* equates to fluid viscosity - how faithfully one particle "sticks" to another. Generally, this is good enough to simulate water flowing constantly in a river or through a structure like a sluice, but in truth it's more like low friction marbles rolling down a trough with a thin veil of elastic film covering it.  Where the particle simulation misses the mark in fluid dynamics is in simulating wave physics. In particle physics, each particle supports the mass of the particle on top of it as long as it has a solid surface below it. This means the initial, full volume of the wave can travel endlessly across a flat plane until it collides with an obstruction or the tiny amount of friction eventually erodes the bottom of the mound of particles. In fluid dynamics and wave physics, the full volume and mass of the wave is supported by an equal volume of fluid beneath it. It takes at least 10 feet of water to support a ten foot wave making a total of 20 feet. As soon as a 10 foot wave runs into (say) a 5 foot depth, the wave will break over it's top and reduce down to a 5 foot wave. If this was real the initial wave should have crested and broken down to churning foam as soon as it hit the shallow depth of the channel. Your set up is simply taking successive bites out of the total wave volume or total number of particles moving forward. A true volumetric fluid simulator takes a mega computer to calculate in real time.
This is a prime example of "envisioned" vs "reality" because....you didn't make a single tesla valve my guy. Overlay the diagram in the beginning...over what you made, and realize...thats..not the same at all.
You can use Extra Landscaping Tools mod.
Loved it
Can I be pedantic and say Tesla didn't invent electricity, no one did. It's always existed for as long as there's been Earth and probably longer elsewhere in the universe.   More accurate would be to say he developed ways to generate electricity.
it's hard to make unique (and easy to follow) cities skylines videos, but these are dope
Because of you i decide to study engiring.
0:11 Who is that, the guy from the science team??
5:20 I almost believed
The valve is made from the most powerful shape
Your tesla valve is too symmetrical, something an architect would design.
Teslq straight up stole inventions and named them after him
I would like to add that setting the game speed faster also heavily reduces water physics, which mainly causes a lot of water to disappear. That means that if you want the best result for a potential next video on the same subject, I suggest putting it back down to x1 speed.  Sorry if that was said already or if you already knew!
Holy moles, I love this concept! An entire video series of inventions by Davinci, Tesla, and more used in practical ways in games would be a joy to watch (only if narrated by Matt & Patty)
this game has changed from city building to tsunami test simulator. pretty sure the water physic is not the best but RCE manage to produce a great content anyway.
Quality videos mate. Carry on.
This is a beautiful idea
could you do without the side walls and just have rows of tesla Valves beside each other? kinda like this \\ // \\ // \\ //
More to point campus
That's a very strong and long lasting shape! Ah! the power of engineering
LOL I showed the tsunami a dikpic and it ran away!
Venice needs this
Funny how you're trying to add real life things into a game that is clearly not coded for it haha
This is the same concept as a silencer?
crackerbox
As the Tsunami is not a constant flow some of the principles you mentioned do not apply. You could try to stop the river with a Tesla valve but even if it works it would probably just cause it to overflow as there is no roof to fully stop flow
i perdict that the  stargey is going to work
Love the tsunami series
can you stop a tsunami with a tsunami
Tesla Coil Tesla IRL  Coil in GTA  Why?
I seen Paul Hibbert on toast!
Shoutout to The Action Lab whom I learned about this from.👏
I love how you were making baffles for a suppressor lol
casually using city skylines as a physics simulator…
can we see an episode with a proper tesla valve. without the central openin and properly zig zag patterns. city skylines probably isnt good for it, could the timberborners do it?
Would probably work better if you actually made a tesla valve
Why is there just random chirping (like birds tweeting) every so often in the video?? Anyone else hear this or just me?
Don't forget to like and comment everyone. Let's get it back in trending
okay so given that the wave front moves at a set speed can you get it to actually reverse the flow such that the water never even reaches the city?
9:45 The formula A1 * v1 = A2 * v2 (for an incompressible fluid like water we can ignore density) works only in one directional motion. When the canal narrowed, if the only direction that the water can go is left, then yes your velocity would have increased. However, the water was able to move upwards, meaning your cross section area of the water flow pretty much didn’t change, which is why you see no change in velocity
I'm legitimately impressed that the water physics work well enough for this to function, I honestly thought it would maintain a wall of water down the middle, while the remainder completed a simple rebound. I'm familiar with the Tesla valve and have seen on a small scale how it functions, just wasn't expecting it to be so effective in CS.
Now you have to try it offset and with a entire width of the tsunami.
"Peace, love and Tesla valve" - kinda rhymes :D
I'm curious, what would happen if you had one side of the tesla valve along the shoreline?
STOP calling this a tesla valve. You even showed a picture of one, and what you build is NOT that. Neither in look, nor in funktion. All your "valve" does, is split the wave in roughly 1/3s every few hundred feet. Let it spread out and then cut it in 3rds again. But so long as there is a straight line path to your city, they are gonna get wet. What you want to do is have the path zig zag a bit, so that (traveling against the flow) the majority of the wave travels straight into the loop section of the valve.
Fun fact, those valves look a lot like the valves in veins :)
Works much like a suppressor. Pretty cool!
Hi matt i'm a BIG fan and have been loving these video's! Keep uo the good work!
How often do you really use those bracing things??????????
Hours to calculate water, and it was probably done with a FirePro or Quadro.  Yeah if I can barely keep up with a huge population on a 16 core cpu, there isn't hope for accurate water physics lmao.
15:33 There is a problem, you are trying to split the wave into three, as you split it, the the smaller path of least resistance, actually loose force so you need to split it into two with each entrance, this also helps water flow the opposite way easier.  causing water eddies in the path of half of the water. Each valve is offset for maximum effect.
Seriously let’s all take a moment to put some respect on Tesla’s name. He was an honorable man and asexual icon. His genius paved the way to our society
Should I be concened that the final product doesn't resemble the Tesla-valve image he had shown in the beginning? The original wasn't even symmetrical... O.o
Day 7 of asking for Auckland in Mini Metro
Erosion.
Theres game, relatively old now, but fun fluid dynamics. "From Dust" It was an XBLA game about guiding your tribe to settle and fighting the angry seas, among other natural elements
City at the head of the strongest shape. Did not call it Tipton
Funny thing, that professional software to simulate actual fluids is only so expensive because they don't expect many people to buy it and because they often have a monopoly on the product and can charge any price they goddamn want.  Some things like gravitational simulations can be done better, faster and cheaper by some video games than by professional software
your obsession with the "strongest shape" is a bit worrying sometimes.  btw you can raise or lower road elevations, and if you drop it enough it goes into tunnel mode and you dont have to worry about the weird raised tunnel thing, you can make roads go underground pretty dang far, just start the tunnel before the wall and exit after and it should be fine.
I think the issue here is that the tesla value works on the premise of the water in the "catches" will travel faster than the water in the main channel, but the relationship between volume and speed isn't simulated in the engine.
Tesla...Matt...what do these names have in common? ....Tsunamis. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh well, there's no delete button.
i wonder if you could somehow do this in the Beaver game.
Your thumbnail baited me. Im only here to comment you built it wrong. For shame Mr. Engineer.
if there isnt a constant pressure you can make the valve scale smaller with each tier of the valve. so first loop is big, next is smaller next is smaller etc, as you do that you can reduce the height of the wall and the width of the inlet. This should let you cover more ground and reduce the length of the shift, while enhancing its girth.
I'm really glad he made this video because it's hard to find people to read my comments. I am trying to become a walrus I'm already half way there. I live both on land and at sea, I eat fish most of the time and I'm 300 POUNDS. All I need is my flippers and walrus teeth. If everyone can just send me .01 Bitcoin I'm sure the doctors in Venezuela can do the procedures needed for me to become a walrus!!
You can basically draw an outline with roads, and then use terraforming tools to make really accurate things
now, i wonder how Timberborns water simulation would compare to this.
The probably unintentional pattern at 9:44 looks really cool!
"I guess we could call that the tip" :🤣🤣🤣
makes me wonder how that design would do in timberborn, since its water simulation does seem to handle volume as well as velocity
Mhmmm pp land? N why just why of all the things just why
I think it might have worked even better if you had made the valve get smaller the further in you went
INFO: Tesla considered most natural elements had a "natural" way of controlling them, and said he thought most things like electricity, water, and wind, control mechanics were interchangeable in some degrees, this valve was one of the pieces he was commissioned to make to reduce the need for complex one way valves, which at the time were difficult to manufacture. Of corse the people who commissioned him to build this one way valve thought it was ridiculous, even thought they knew nothing about water works.
SO YOU NECER ACTUALLY BUIy been tested T A TESLA VALVE... clickbait much. seriously though. water dynamics aside this could have actuall y been tested
After see this I realize how many it's your knowledge about fisic and also you know nothing about tesla valve
Really RCE, really? A benis? Are you serious? An if the so-called „bracings“ are really helping, why not put them at the tip? *HMMMM?*
Early in I see a design flaw. You should make a deeper channel up the middle and a relief hole at the top so if any water DOES get to the top it has a safe release area.
Dunno why but this video's thumbnail is a dark grey slate. Even after multiple refreshes and looking at it from the channel.
Isn’t a valve supposed to let you control the flow?
I'd be curious how it does if you just make a 3 layer curved walls at the shore instead of just one valve how much area you'd have to build and be safe
Tesla is one of my favourite people in history, his designs and inventions are amazing, we wouldn’t have alternating current without him.
Ahhhhh not a good sight being a bird 🤣
I LOVE THESE!!
I think a wave behaves differently than a mass of water, all with pressure behind it?
the weenie got me subbed! just wanted to say that   'ducks away'
I demand a new review show. You need to review water physics in games, give them scores, with your knowledge it's interesting
what's up with the shape  like is it just me or is it looking kinda SUS
I’m confused by this mostly because im half way paying attention but sounds like fun
isnt the tesla valve offset rather than parallell?
sory for that hahahaha XD
if there wasn't strong shape it wouldn't work
:D
Given the water physics in Timberborn actually speeds up and slows down with obstacles, I won't hw these flood measures would work there
can you do smartphone tycoon
I have to wonder if Oxygen Not Included would simulate this effect better. They focused a lot more on fluid dynamics.
Your videos are very fun to watch although why are u not using more landscaping tools mod
A very old game with surprisingly good liquid physics, was a game called *From Dust* ... unfortunately, it was a very quirky game, and they never did anything further with the liquid physics of that game .. a shame really. But it had water and lava, and you could change the ground, by picking up dirt and placing it in new places .. which would then be eroded over time, and create new sediment flood plains, whereas if Lava and water met, you got lava rock formation. The last map, I think it was, there was even rain fall, which was incredibly well modelled. It was really too bad they didn't do more with that game engine !
So from the thumb nail just a reminder that tesla valve is offset braking line of site rather than a straight shot
OMG how can't you see that the center line has to be blocked by every single arms on q real Tesla Valve ... engineer ??  Love you tho
I’d love to see this again with the Tesla valve off-shoots staggered.  I’d be willing to bet you could remove 1-2 of the valves (depending on the water physics).
Big wave
Since how the game renders it, by having a wider entrance at first whould also stop the overspill on the first one, then shrinking the gap, however this means there whould be needed atleased one aditionall valve
I don't know what you have built there, but it's definitely not a Tesla valve. It barely even resembles the reference picture you put up at the start.
dude. there's gotta be a game you can play that renders water physics correctly. it kills me to see you do all this when the water sim is SO bad 😂
You've essentially created a gun silencer.
Jurassic worlds play through
Testing a Tesla-valve on a tsunami. Reasonable. Thats just how i know Matt
Was that a beardless Simon Whistler? 0:11
I think you missed the part where there's no open channel down the center of a Tesla valve. Not that it really matters in this game engine tho lol.
Interesting how engeneering works!😂
Leaky tip town
Next time try to build the silencer mechanism. I think it might work
The ultimate edging tool
i was waiting for the valve logo to show up.. you delivered, you earned 10 meme points with that move. good job.

Is it really a coincidence that everything you make to stop tunamis look like a large penis?
What if you narrowed the valve as it progresses?
He's talking about not-a-real-fluid-simulation and I'm thinking... maybe in Creeper World 4?
I need more engineering content asap
Your elevation from the beach to your city was much lower hence why the first static run dissipated the wave by the time it reached, should try putting the city below sea level and see what the physics give you as far as speed and height goes.
tesla valve, YOU HAD ONE JOB SIR,
If this works in this simulation, has it already been made in real life for flood control somewhere?
Some minor pedantry: this design is a baffled suppressor, not a tesla valve. A tesla valve doesn't have any single straight line through the valve. Then again... I doubt this game's fluid sim could tell the difference. Excellent video either way
Can we get more timberborners pls
Maybe a huge muff could take on a giant tsunami?

I do like all those flood walls along the shaft. Almost like there's veins of wall or something...
You should try that in Timberborn. Have you seen how good is the water physics in this game?
Make each individual "runner" shorter, make the tips closer to the other tips (narrowing the passage) and scale the whole thing WAAAAY down, you should see more lively physics from the game
This would probably work really well in tue game is there was a 2nd tidal wave behind the first
theres a small problem tho... thats not a tesla valve, YOU HAD ONE JOB  tesla valve works so well cuz it curves the water back into the main stream,  using the water itself to stop the water flowing down,
Mate, you didn't make a Tesla Valve, you made a Rifles Suppressor, the central channel is dead straight, look at Tesla Valve images again it's more S bendy
5:19 “bracing piers” saw it coming, still laughed 😂
This wasn't a tesla valve... they aren't straight.
*City floods, hundreds of people are left homeless or with power.*  Real Civil Engineer: "That's a success!"
10:15 So if you usually call our pepe the strongest shape, is this the weakest shape?
10:43 don't think this game will simulate vorticity (?)
8:40 So first we have an ejaculating ponis and now theres a Veginja as well lel
What an introduction to the Tesla valve. BRAVO!
RCE that is a veiny shaft
Dont fluids slow down as pressure builds? It's been a while since I've had fluid dynamics but I remember something like that being a rule
Come on RCE, in Tesla valve the sides aren’t symmetrical. One side is “moved forward” compared to the other one so the water coming back from 1 side pushes the main stream into the other side and so on.
Ngl when i looked at the thumbnail i throught it was a gun supressor, its interesting how similar they are
E
This is just a physics lesson in disguise  Not complaining tho
That wasn’t a Tesla valve, also Tesla valves stop continuous flow, no idea if they can stop a pulse like you are trying to do.
I love how Matt is talking about water mechanics and sais stuf like "narrower ergo more speed"... With a sunami XD. Dude, those kinds of things work only under pressure, like inside of a water system, not on an open river, the water wont accelerate if the path gets narrower, where the does the energy come from for that?. You are an Engineer!!
the invention of electricity? lol
I loven your videos
You could probably make even finer walls if you used single lane roads (unless it changed since I played last, roads also keep the terrain beneath them at level when you change the terrain around them)
Love this tsunami series! love to see such concept on timberborn as well!
You should see if it still works with continuous water flow (multiple waves? Or a below sea level build?)
I feel a lot safer now, knowing how civil engineers are working 😁
If i may make a suggestion: you already know of a game made for water physics! Timberborn! I tried some of these the other day and found it easiest to do in creative utilizing pauses and instant terrain modification.
Dude. You did not recreate a Tesla Valve. What would you rate your Tesla Valve (TV) in a Tesla Valve Review...? I recon your TV doesn't measure up to the Dev's bridge in Hydroneer. Honestly. Your TV is not at all good.
2 things: 1st, you should see if offsetting the curved parts and forcing the water to zig zag its way through does anything. 2nd, can somebody please make a "speed up time" button
Your city has schools and churches, those buildings have bells to announce things, something, something, bellend.
You may want to consider the lack of volume constriction for the tsunami in the vertical direction. The pressure that would have otherwise driven the Venturi effect you described seemed to be used to just elevate the water over those cliff faces as opposed to apply to the flow ahead. That may be why you didn't notice any velocity change whatsoever.
you know the sewer grate in the town in idleon click to walk in front of the sewer grate then click on the sewer grate itself with the bolt cutters the you get from the green slime in your inventory then you enter the sewers(Warning the enemies there are strong)there is also a boss in the sewer somewhere but i wont spoil where and what it is for you also the little gem icon on the map is actually where the boss is in idleon world 1 that boss gives the gem to fix the portal in town in world 1 to get to world 2
I will never not see Tesla valves as veins.
RCE might be the first person to construct a vasectomy in Cities Skylines...
How can you call that a Tesla valve when it has a straight path all the way through? I guarantee you if you had built it correctly there would have been no water with just a few sections
That structure be looking sus
ah yes, another video re-valve-ing around the Tsunami Map.
That is not a tesla valve. That is just a narrowing with something that we could maybe call a suppressor.
Since the first time i watched this videos i was waiting for this!! Great idea
because it is a moving mass of water not a flow driven by a steady pressure the simulation showing it not speeding up but getting taller is (mostly) correct
Woohooo congratulations
A very effecient shaft indeed.
Yay
I would watch a PPV of this guy playing SPORE Creature creator
The way games usually simulate water is by generating a mesh of semi-random vertices, then connecting those vertices with edges that work like springs (they literally use the same formula). Some post processing is then done to make the surface look better and smoother but, under the hood, it's still a cloud of floaty, springy points holding hands.  You could try out Blender's fluid physics to check how much more accurate they are. Staring at Blender's grey shapes is probably not that fun, but you could probably get someone to build a cute playground.
lmao finally some engineer lvl content, great stuff man
Bro use common sense
Well, as a fan, I would have been disappointed if he missed this opportunity to make fhe strongest shape in the world... But he fulfilled the expectations.
I'm extra stoked on this one, I work in a winery and valves are life. Fun stuff
Just Bild a water supresser sry for Bad Englisch
And now try that in Timberborn please!
The strongest shape, once again appaers
i never felt like how it feels to be pinned...
the water mechanic doesnt do justice but thankfully i learned water and air flow movement through venturi tube already and that makes it that i can understand what matt says
But now the question is: could you make a city that could survive 3 or more Tsunamis back to back?
I believe, an important feature of the tesla valve is, that the water flows back into the main stream, blocking it. But in this case, the main wave was faster than the waves at the side, neglegting this advantage. So with an extra curve for the main wave in order to match the distance traveled by the second wave, this walve should become even more effective.
I think this would be a lot more effective if you built it correctly, the Tesla valve doesn't have a straight path with a bunch of outlets to the side, it's a zigzagged path with outlets made to force the water back into the path of the flow
The thumbnail is not an actual Tesla valve!!!!  A Tesla valve alternates loops! And has no center channel  that is clear through like this Matt.
This looks nothing like an actual tesla valve... unfortunate title
Im suprised RCE didnt notice that the channels look like dong hairs.
I love these videos they're great keep going with the tsunami
I knew what you were making with the strongest design, and yet it still caught mw off guard.
What RCE is doing?  Saving people - that's good. From a tsunami he created - that's bad.
Absolutely phenomenal design choice! 10/10 would watch again!
Tesla valves don't have a central channel though. Isn't it designed so that ALL the flow in one direction gets forced through sequential loops in a zig-zag pattern?
I was gonna suggest a tesla valve! You're awesome! Edit: (watchs video) The symmetry you made is detrimental to the tesla valve. I know it's a natural inclination, but almost everything in nature that "works" is staggered, oscillates or is uneven.  Simple example: put your 'symmetrical' feet side by side touching. Now, stagger them. They will fit together like puzzle pieces and take up less space. The tesla valve wasn't Tesla "dabbling" in fluid dynamics.  It was him applying the same principles to different fields, and pointing to a possible Unified Field Theory.
Day 7of asking matt to play scrap mechanic
This aint quite lookin like a tesla valve. look at the drinking straws people 3d print they give a good simple depiction. the middle channel is too strait. and some other things. same idea as the tesla valve tho.
the buildings that were destroyed were made by architects  and interestingly enough, thats kinda similar to how a guns suppressor works
The fluid mechanics in this game are very simple. the fluid will not move faster or slower, it just keeps moving at a constant speed and bounces off obstacles. Therefore, the best defense against a tsunami is simply a few horizontal lines, each subtracting its height from the height of the tsunami. and we need to add some small staggered channels so that the water can drain back into the ocean.
That tesla valve thing looks more like a silencer
Man has heard about a tesla valve, but never actually seen one.  Got to say it. but this doesnt look anything like a tesla valve.
Need I remind you that you build a poo-cano and generated infinite power from poo, you already knew the fluid dynamics of this game weren't true to real life!
0:03 invention of whaa?
Use the airport zoning tool to quickly level land. It's 100x faster, though it does make for rather ugly edges.
You forgot to off set/ stagger the sides! :(
not to be picky or anything ... but this was not a real tesla valve a tesla valve doesn't have a straight way in the middle
Unfortunate that the wave isn't made of water physics and more like a jelly  Would be really cool to recreate these with water physics
Not a tesla valve
12:17, that also bears frightful resemblance to the baffels in a suppressor/silencer, except a suppressor is always connected to the walls, this catches gas, which lessens the noise
You should take the MoveIt! mod and turn that Tesla valve around to see how badly it works in that orientation.
If it's the software I'm thinking of (ANSYS), there's a few channels out there that are using it to model things like what happens if you shoot a tank with a battleship shell, or how well does armour stand up to a BB being fired at the speed of light.  Wonder if you still have access to it? How well could ANSYS model a bridge built out of rubber bands? :P
5:23 that sus bro…..
The landscaping mod allows you to turn off water spawners, fyi  also, there is a 9× speed mod
12:33 Not that sorry. Arent you?
Really amazing
one more thing, a tesla valve doesnt have a straight line, that would just compromise the effectiveness
The game is Just spliting the main wave...
ok, so tesla valve works like a ejaculation... seem neat
Those videos are so nice to see! 😊
Very freaking interesting !!!
This is epic watching you defend tsunami and really entertaining I particularly enjoyed when it failed! 😃
Yes water dynamics is preety hard to simulate
you say loads way too many times in this video lol
Can you play satisfactory
there is a mod that makes brushes a lot bigger
Obviously real tesla valves have a lid, so water pressure actually make sense. It probably wouldn't make a lot of sense for water that is open to the sky, other than in terms of height. Also, a tesla valve do not actually stop the flow. Because it need flow in order to operate.
That is looks more like a supressor than a tesla valve. And you got some parts wrong about the curves that redirekt the waterflow in a tesla valve. I recomend you watch a video from integza on Youtube.
Can a poop tsunami stop a tsunami?
Yo
i'm a little disapointed by your tesla valve, i have to say it... There is no longitudinal gap in a real tesla valve !  However, thanks for your work, i enjoy every of your episodes
Could you try to make a railroad engineering marvel which also includes a variety of trains from both steam and diesel?
I love the city at just the tip of the rock hard tube....the circular supports are particularly inspired, we just have to watch out for the turning blue from the repeated fondling from the hot tsunami-chan
i liked it
How i can put anywhere bridge
should get on trending
very nice
cool
How about sending 2 or 3 more waves after each other so you can see if the trap thingy is working.
Day 1 of waiting for RCE to play Team Fortress 2
Just when I thought he was being serious about engineering he builds another massive dong. Lmao
Can’t lie I like these educational videos
Im so tired of eggplants.
Try move all water from tsunami to one canyon. good luck :)
Matt goes to make a tesla valve. Ends up making a silencer/suppressor. Wrong kind of engineering.
I really enjoy coming home from work and lean back in my gaming chair and watch your stuff its entertainig and realxing 👍🏻🙂
Guess We are not going to talk about how his walls look like a cock and balls imagine? lololol
Tesla valves aren't straight like that.
Wooohho
There's a bit, there's a bob.
Anno 1800
But but. That isn’t a Tesla valve. There isn’t a gap in the middle of a Tesla valve.   You showed a picture then didn’t actually make it like the picture!
7:35 When you started the test this was all I could think of.  "Come on RCE! how could you overlook that detail.... HE DELIVERS!"
Watching the water physics reminds me more of light waves then hydrodynamics
Hugest p p ever 😎
You know, you almost got me with them "bracing peirce"
I am Early... kind of
5:04 why i believe that "90 degrees isn't structurally sound" ???!! u brainwashed mee
I'm so glad he made this. I was wondering how the tesla valve would do in this game since his last video.
love the videos
Wow. That is big boy wave
Turn the tsunami into a poo-nami
This thumb nail made me go. "Oooooooh"
Thanks for the knowledge but I’m on holiday
LOL crazy  idea but it seems work.
Bruh, that wave goes annoyingly slowly
you forgot  the most important valve - the devs of steam
Comment for the algorithm
Good video
nice
Bit dull that the walls where so high but still fun!
Never though I see an YouTuber use an creamapi lols
Finally watched one of these videos since the title was really interesting and what do you know...     It was indeed just as clickbaity as expected from videos that look like this. The video even includes a picture of a tesla valve at 11:33 , and yet that picture isn't even slightly followed in the video... Guess I know a bit more not to trust channels with content like this.
Just imagine, that would be actual anatomy.
You built something similar but this is not a resla valve the tesla valve has the tips of the diverters sticking into the center line in a stagared fashion instead of a srraight shot down the middle.
it would cheaper build straight wall
Hopefully it was a video with the strongest shape that made the trending
Are you absolutely sure the water physics scale up the way you think? Most valves etc are designed for pipes,  which are significantly smaller scale than a tsunami, and where things like the hydrogen bonds of water have some small impact.  Essentially increasing scale would effectly cause the fluid to have less surface tension and change the domain of things like Reynolds number etc.  Ocean sized mechanics probably rely far more on wave dynamics.  With that in mind,  you could have actually ran in parallel with multiple different valve designs simultaneously to reduce render time.    Also the final design of the Tesla valve also has slightly  overlapping and alternating lobes or valves.
5:29 never change rce Never change
I regret wasting 20 minutes of my life waiting for tesla valve and realising none was built...
tsunami
You could also do a Tesla valve on the river! Blocking the tsunami while the river can flow normally.  And I am curious how it would effect two tsunamis after each other, or a river; trying to block a continuous flow
love the content keep it up
there shouldn't be a single large path down the middle, the valve should alternate channels and allow a single main ess-curved route
What if you extended those smaller Islands to the center corridor?!
Please play IncrediBots!! It's kind of like Poly Bridge and it's just your thing!!
What An  Amazing Intro    I ❤️ RCE
This is like the design inside a gun suppressor that catches and redirects gas
Very cool Series
Try this in timberborn
Timberborn has better water physics
Nice video, but that's not a tesla valve
Share you didn't build a reference channel next to it. Just to compare how much the water lowered.
There’s loads of different valves, and none of them has issued Half-Life³.
You didn't really create a tesla valve as your iteration allows fluid to travel straight through, looks more like an experimental suppressor.
Apple
Sue the tsunami
do IT engineers count as engineers or are we just architects?
Was going to say your first test where you wanted to see if the water speed increased when you restrict the canal (it didn't) pretty much means your Tesla valve won't work as intended, since the point is to funnel off some of the fluid that'll move faster and end up pushing back the wave front that created it.
That's not a tesla valve. The center path of a tesla valve zigzags, with each corner  'splitting' into a loop that forces the fluid around and back onto itself. There is no straight line path through a tesla valve in either direction. I'm not even an engineer and I know that what you built is just a series of baffles with a channel in the center more akin to a silencer for a gun.
use extra landscape mod. its so much faster. you get larger brush and stronger brush too.  matt forgot the one principle theres no pressure of course its not going to go faster.
Neat = I'm almost positive it didn't stop due to being a tesla valve and more because of magic skylines physics, but fun to watch
A further adaptation would be this: instead of having a big wall all the way across the bay with just one Tesla valve channel, build a set of Tesla channels, all the way across the width of the bay.  But closer to the ocean with more space behind for the city.  The Tesla valve sea defenses thereby break up and dissipate the energy of the water before it reaches the city.  THEN, you only need a very small wall in front of the city itself to ensure that it keeps the city perfectly dry.  And that's only really needed due to the deficiencies of the game's water physics.  It means the inhabitants get a good view of the ocean too, instead of one down a narrow channel (although it is a strong efficient channel).  It also means the river can flow out of one of the channels, relatively unhindered.
Now to try it in timberborn. They are supposed to have great water physics
That's what they meant by Hank Hill having a narrow urethra.
7:37 As a fellow child, I would have been deeply upset had you not done this.
Since I understand Tesla valves as flow. What would happen with a tesla valve in a canal or river?
i was here
guys i have question, if i download some mods in my cities skylines, and delete it in steam and download again will my world with mod save? Or will something change in that world or no? or what will happen?
I feel like this would work better in timber born
The whole idea of water speeding up when constrained only works when constraint is on all sides. since your channels were open at the top, that isn't going to happen. Skylines actually did a decent job simulating how the water would work in these situations.
Hi rce, you might remember me from one of kosmos videos in the comments. I love these videos. I have cancer tho and will not be able to enjoy them for much longer 😔.  It would make my life if you can shout me out in your next video.
i love your videos
In all the time you spent being an architect with this strong looking shaft, we could have hade a few more strong shapes made from buildings, streets & trains 👁👄👁
MATT USE THE EXTRA TERRAFORMING TOOLS MOD FROM THE STEAM WORKSHOP!
My man .. :D  Ez sub lol
Su nah me
I think the way this game simulates this has much more in common with the wave dynamics of light. You should make a diffraction grating or double slit or some other optical thing to see what that does.
Real Civil(Phallic) Engineer
Why do u love that body part bruh
You need to call your followers "The Pen-15 Peeps" 😉
Can the strongest shape defend the city tho
Love it🌚🌚🌚🌚
Instructions unclear, built a Tesla valve, now I have ED
5:10 don’t forget to cup the structural walls😏
Very educational and very good 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🙃🙃☺️☺️☺️😁😁😁
Unfortunately the game doesn't know about fluid dynamics. It works only because it effectively keeps spreading a narrower wave of water to the sides and the backwards water flow doesn't slow down the wave in the middle
Typing...
I don’t know which editor did this, but I really liked the arrows! (like at 12:20)
The janky fluid physics means it kind of chops the wave up into several smaller waves which can't go as far, which ends up working really well to save the town.
Nice
You videos like this have resulted in me crashing my computer trying to run all these mods. XD
Pecker jokes 🤣
Before the Test, shouldnt we ask if cities Skylines is an adequate fluid Simulation?
I think to really make this a good flood defense , you would need to put a canal straight across the channel,  quite near to the tip 🤔
I would have loved to see the valves on the outside of the channel you made instead of inside.  that way you wouldnt have that initial 2/3 being blocked by the valve.
Love it!
Lol
Aren't the top and bottom halves of the valve supposed to be staggered to get the full effect and allow them to be over lapped?
geniass
Can you increase the tsunami height in this game by funneling the wave 🌊 into a increasingly narrow canyon?
What do you mean Tesla was ONE OF the main inventors of electricity? He WAS the inventor of electricity and it was T.Edison whom STOLE Tesla's work because Edison already had a major company and money. It's the same with everything. If you have money and power, you rule the corrupt world.
Bro i want this software 😍
I'm not a fan of how you pierced the tip like that.
Now try it in timberborn
Corporate boss: "Can you tell me who the hell in here used our ANSYS software to draw a giant, veined d*ck?"  Engineer: "That's not what you think! It's a project to save the humanity!"
Does this game still have the mechanic where running at high speed makes the water wall move faster? There might be less intensity of the wave at normal game speed.
How do i find this map?
can you do a video about the valve with the Fluidsimulator?
Before starting, I'll guess no. Wonky fluid physics  Edit: I stand corrected! The fluid physics are definitely wonky because they probably don't account for the changes in velocity, but it does behaves like a wave, as we can see the interference patterns before the valve set, and the diffraction as the water gets past the narrower section. So it doesn't works as intended, but achieves the goal, which in my experience as a programmer, is pretty par for the course. Once again, well done Matt
Ribbed… for our pleasure ;).
There is a mod for the cities game that lets you use the edit level terrain tool settings in game, it has much more options and lets you change sea level, great water sources et cetera. It's called Extra Landscaping Tools
God loves all of us so much He came in the flesh to die and rise so that if we choose to accept Jesus as our one true Savior turning from our sins we may be gifted eternal salvation through Christ’s perfect sacrifice on the cross. Have a great day
Stopping tsunamis with wiener shaped walls @ 5:30
Dear RCE would you ever do something like a user-submitted bridge review video/stream?
Invention of electricity... a yes, when we designed a natural force.
hey do you know the name of the map in the steam workshop bro
You could have rounded the base of the shaft, instead of rectangulr edges, that would cause less of a splash and you could have gotten a more powerful tsunami.
It would have worked better had you built the valve correctly with the offsets though. You could have likely stopped the tsunami in game with just three valves with offsets.
Which mod do you use to activate that 'mega tsunami'?  As far I know the Ragnarok mod is broken, or does it still work on 'command'?
It would help if you actually built a Tesla valve, which you didn’t in this demonstration. Seriously, look at how what you built is only partly like  Tesla valve, but lacks key features.
Um his name is Elon Musk....here's. engineer he says
Valved for our pleasure.
Next episode the Tesla turbine 🤣🤣
As pipefitter i found this video very good 10/10
Play tf2, theyhave an engeneer class (character) please!
Electricity was a discovery. It always existed, they just figured out how to harness it.
We need a whole game dedicated to surviving tsunamis
Yes only engineers could make something like this yes also do you want to collab mabye and I know you’re most likely not gonna see this but still
This is one of your better videos in my opinion, well done.
I love this series.   I have never shouted at my screen more :D :D :D :D
Love it! The Tesla valve is so simple but effective, and has no moving parts to maintain. I think it's actually used today in a few applications. I do feel you could make offset parallel valve streams, though, to cover the width of  the land area.  I know this was probably mostly for fun, but I'm interested in the practice of the valve in such a scenario. So...  One good defense approach against a wave/tsunami is a concave wall. The Tesla valve is pretty much a series of offset, mirrored concave walls. I wonder: if we just take the one side of the valve, flip it so that the back-flow is facing down to the ground, and build it leading into the ground as a series of back-flow funnels (no top/roofing), how effective that'd be. It'd take up a long stretch of land to do, but you'd essentially be chipping away at the underneath of the wave at each back-flow point. This way, you wouldn't need to build up, you'd just need to dig down. Has something like this been tested before? 🤔 I'm not sure if my explanation was executed well enough to be understood, but I hope so. lol
This background music is incredibly annoying. Makes me anxious.
these videos trending on youtube?  outstanding!
hary balls
10/10 Nikola Tesla 10/10 Civil engineer
I think with a little offset in the openings in the valves it would have been even more effective
The valves are suppposed to be offset as the water can just easily go down the middle
9:30 -technically the game isn't wrong here- ok it's not 100% correct but also not 100% wrong :D - the reason water speeds up when a pipe has a constriction is because it has to to keep the same volume of water per unit of time(litres per minute, or whatever). the game still keeps the same volume per time by piling more water vertically as there is no way to restrict the flow on the vertical axis
yo hello my dude
I like how the textures glich out at the floodwalls
the shape haha
Wonder when Breakwater (in Early Access) has their Creator mode, I wonder if you could do this sort of test with it? Apparently it uses more realistic water physics (it's also harder on GPUs) but it be interesting to see if you could do this sort of thing with that and it's water!
I just got a mini lesson on fluid dynamics using a giant penis in a game about building cities.
The tsunami ang mini motorways videos are the best
🔥
_
"Lets build Tesla Valve!" - builds a giant dick....
More Planet crafter episodes asap🗣
wouldnt it work even better if you do a split befor the actual valve ? like just a triangle pointing at the wave directly :D
Others :- Let's test tsunami in a quarter scale. RCE :- YESSS. 😈
One thing I think you are not accounting for is that the water can still get higher so the horizontal force is strong enough to overcome gravity pulling the water down. That's why the speed doesn't increase.
I mean, my snorkel has a much better method. Just have alternating barriers that extend over halfway across so that water is always having to hit a barrier
Do this again but offset the valve properly! You got it wrong mate!
Did matt just destroyed the bridge that the train was on??????????????????
There should be a mod that makes the waters speed a bit more realistic, cause it wasn't really changing speed at all even from going up a slope, which is all it really needs
A Tesla valve is supposed to alternate sides too so it is not hitting two at the same time.
It's like a firea*ms suppressor only using water as the fluid instead of combustion gasses.
5:30 why does all of his designs look like a spaceship
Watching from the euro tunnel (in the tunnel underground), they added mobile data antennas down here!
Watching from the euro tunnel (in the tunnel underground), they added mobile data antennas down here!
hi i love your vids
We need to get you a game with realistic water physics
can a tsunami stop a tsunami?
tesla valve is ok but in the strong shape..... perfect balanced.
Hey Matt, you should try the Tesla Valve in Timberborn. Great work!
Wow I am early
Very cool Matt, But perhaps a more constant flow would be better for a tesla valve? Perhaps something poopy? Do you have something like that?
Water physics simulation accuracy: 50%. Traffic / driver behavior accuracy: 100%
I would like you to do a series about water physics in different games. For example the narrower/faster flow didnt work in cities skylines, but will it in Timberborn?
19:00 there is a lot of free, open source software which is used in engineering, physics research etc., that simulates fluid dynamics correctly, and is used in real science. The on that's used most in engineering afaik, is OpenFoam.
Isn‘t it much more of a difference in speed, if you have a pipe with fixed area compared to a open canal, where the Area depends of the hight of the water?  Because in a pipe, the formula Q=v*A with fixed Q means the velocity is directly antiproportional to the area. In an open rectangular canal, the formula Q=v*A can be written as Q=v*w*h, so when changing the with of the canal, the water gets deeper or shallower, but the velocity changes only little
I think the physics are actually correct, what you expect applies for sealed pipes, where a reduction in area increases the speed and reduces the pressure. In this case most of the water is at atmospheric pressure-ish, so we won't see the effect of dynamic forces. What we saw in the area reduction example was an increase in the head (height) of the wave, which can occur as there are no volume constraints.
Comment
Here we go again, Matt the Mad designing a realistic city design
im not a engineer... I AM A SPACE ENGINEER
Tesla valves are offset
Please keep uploading City Skylines! Feels like these videos come out once in a millennia!
Shouldn't one side be longer on the inlet alternating breaking up the main wave more?
Just imagine how well it would work if you staggered the pockets and narrowed the gap
While the design idea is right, that's not quite the proper design for a Tesla valve. There should be no straight through-and-through channel down the middle. It should have a slight winding curve that won't allow water to pass straight through. This is made by having the diverging channels staggered against each other on both sides and having the walls extend past the center point. Essentially, each turn of the winding center channel is forcing fluid down these diverging side channels to create a blackflow and turbulence. It's this created backflow and turbulence that makes a Tesla valve function as one-way valve. Theoretically, a proper designed Tesla valve should stop the constant pressure of an elevated ocean, not just a single tsunami wave, and thus make a city below sea level possible.
Can you try with an "actual" tesla valve? Means not symmetrical and the central corridor not in a streight line
🌚 if you know you know
I new you would do that shap
This is a certified tsunami moment
You could honestly create a video called 'rate my bridge' where the viewers send in there own bridge creations on various games and you just review them. And the best ones will placed in the hall of fame. P.s love your vids
I want the real Tesla Valve.
What if you inverted a tesla valve.  Imagine if you will it staggering/overlapping walls so it 'slices' off sections of the wave to fling it back out to sea.  So instead of looping water to inside the wall, it flings it out.  Then waves start hitting each other and all water energy is redirected outwards.  Something that could be built along the coast that way.
I feel like every city should have flood walls shaped like this. 8===========-)
Just a quick point - tesla valves don't really work well with pulsed water - they're made more for limiting constant pressure.  Very much not what this is!
given that your tesla valve is enormous, it doesnt give us average sized tesla valves the perspective we need…
I never expect it to be an penis, and every time it’s a penis.
Someone make this man a water physics mod.
Do you know about the mosquitoes in the underground that don't feed on humans
You made the strongest shape noice
thanks for doing my suggestion awesome vid
He’s the last person I thought who would make a non-moving valve
When RCE fools you for a moment with engineering talk before revealing he once again drew the strongest shape. I guess I really should have seen that coming.
I’ve been loving these tsunami videos
15:45 I think it works better in cities skyline because it behaves as 3 backwards valves you made before, and not as much as the intended way. But still a great video
RCE: "This is just gonna strengthen it up." Me: "🤦 here we go again..." 😂😂😂
Slightly disappointed that it is not a proper tesla valve.
Matt...you already did this in Engitopia, but you can use seawalls to make a straight guide line for your landscaping walls, y'know?  XD
Nikola Tesla invented electro motor that's why Elon wont that name 💪
y'know, I put up with all the genitalia jokes and all the not-really-very-funny architect hate, but a thumbnail saying "tesla valve" of something that is very obviously NOT a tesla valve is either ragebait or just bad understanding of the engineering, and I'm not here for either of those. Unsubbing, see ya.
Just add some drainage canals along the shaft and the water may not reach the city
This is not a tesla Valve
Love the cities skylines videos
holy jesus last time i was here you where at 100k congrats man
i think the water might have been programmed as effectively massless, behaving more like light wave interactions rather than matter interactions
Like a blood vessel!!!
You can do this with either a maze or you have interlocking "teeth" coming off the wall to the middle. The teeth can be well spaced out and then put a bowl at the end. It'll speed the water up, but it drains a lot of pressure.  Also, it would be cool if someone were to actually make a tsunami simulation game. You could probably do some simplified version of a CFD program. It won't be super accurate, but you're also not using it to sign off on a design.
beautiful layout lol
wrong design of the tesla valve. sadge, tesla would be disappointed
Nice, I’ve seen a howl vid regarding the Tesla valve. Interesting mechanics. Real feed of engineering.
Schmichael did a good job with the intro. 10/10 would recommend
I can’t wait to aggressively explain a Tesla valve to my friends and family
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!   Please do it again but put in channels/canals (elevation drops) to help channel the water into the baffles, should require less baffles if you use elevation properly to divert the water.
I made one of these out of polycarbonate as a science fair project once
Such a strong shape
12:17 Matt... You basiclly have made a gun suppressor
This is the first time ive actually learned something from his vids👍😅
bro this ENJINER just said the INVENTION of electricity. It was DISCOVERED.
It looks almost like the water simulation is using a modified wave simulation to calculate the height speed and trajectory. Maybe next you could try using sound proofing geometries to cheese the game? If the theory holds up it should work even better
Nice 🐓. Tho I'm glad the real ones do not have Tesla valves in them
Should have built a shallow channel through the center of the town. If any water had gotten to that point and could successfully be channeled through the city and exit, it would have saved them the minor flooding. You didn't quite build the gutters in the city big enough.
Isn't the "wave gets taller, keeps speed" behaviour kind of ok since we're talking about an open channel rather than a closed pipe? In theory we're keeping the cross section, right?
The world may never know since you didn't build a Tesla valve...
If you want to see a Tesla valve in action irl the YouTuber Integza built one.
5:24 i did’nt see that coming…
Try the fluid simulator in Blender
you can't slower velocity, only decrease
RCE, you have misunderstood the idea of Tesla valve: it should not work with a tsunami wave at all! The real idea is that the reversed fluxes hit the main flux "head to head" and thus stop it (or, at least, greatly increase the hydrodynamic resistance of the valve). And note that this implies having a rather prolonged push of water! But when you're dealing with a tsunami wave, by the time the reversed fluxes could be pushed back into the main channel, the "main flux" exists no more there: the "direct main wave" has already gone forward and there's no water to push back.  Tesla valves work when they are initially fully filled with a liquid/gas and there is a PRESSURE wave incoming, not MASS wave into an empty system!
Can't you turn on flow arrows in City Skylines?
You should make more  videos with tsunamis
oof. i love you matt, but the inaccuracies when you actually try to explain something really hurt
No opening at the tip of the city for emergeny ejac..evacuations?  (commented literally 1 second too soon, I'm proud of you)
5:24 you are such a troll :'D
This would be much more interesting if city skylines' water physics were more accurate to real life
Can you stop a tsunami without building anything taller than the tsunami.
I prefer it when the water goes faster along my shaft to save time.
I think you build more of a silencer than the Tesla valve 😅
It's 3 in the morning, perfect time to learn a little bit of engineering.
We need a proper tsunami simulator game :)
quite the strong shape you got there lol
Love the tsunami gameplay
Saw this in the first hour! BTW, I love your videos. Keep up the good work with some supports!
This would be interesting to restrict a water spawner to simulate flow.
Love them
What compelled you to be the dick humor guy?
From 2 months ago to 27 minutes ago, that’s how your videos kept me waiting for more 😂
TESLA IS CROAT!!! NOT SVERBIN
You should try these water physics in Timberborn! Not sure if there is a sandbox mode, but that would be amazing.
so the the narrower the water the faster the flow isn't quite true in cities skylines but as speed is just another form of energy a more generalised the narrower the water the more energy would be true as the narrower areas have proven to cause higher waves to move through them
Does anyone have the link to the Tsunami map?
I'm not sure if the wavefront would actually slow down IRL, because the wave is not like a 2D-fluid or something. It can get bigger or lower which is not possible for 2D fluids (or confided 3d fluids for that matter). So I think that reducing the height of the wave is actually the more realistic way of reducing the energy of the wave. I wouldn't really expect the group velocity to change that much in this context. Perhaps in other words: As far as I understand, the tesla valve is primarily designed to stop a constant laminal flow. A tsunami however is a singular wave-packet, which is also not really confined to the tesla valve like a 2D fluid would be. So it still makes sense for the valve to reduce the wave packets energy, but for me it doesn't make intuitive sense to change the dispersion of the water waves and thereby change the velocity of the packet. (I would never expect a wave of lower energy to be slower, I would always expect it to have a lower amplitude.)
instead of having a big wall then one tesla valve could you have a wall of tesla valves for the same effect?
I'm sorry to say it Matt. Although you're a great engineer, you kinda try to use 2D solutions in a 3D environment. A venturi will speed up the flow, but not if there is still other places for your fluid to go (like up)...
"... And because I'm a child"I would have done the same thing LMAO
Thanks to this clip, I understood how the silencer works
I bought this game recently and have been playing it a ton. The water physics are good for hours of fun.
These Dong jokes are trending on youtube. Take a moment to recognize that.
Hi
Timberborn
Algorithm thins one right here
7:40 WHY?
commenting for the algo
RCE You need to join up with some devs (but no architects) and build a game solely designed around protecting cities from a variety of natural disasters... with a much more realistic physics engine and more intuitive terraforming tools!
Finally Early
Can you try this with timberborn water mechanics?
5:23 I laughed, probably too hard.
Pls make ur vids a bit longer like up to 25 minutes. I enjoy them soo much that it only feels like 2 minutes i watched they rlly funny and nice. sorry if this offends you in any way
Excited Integza noises
Amazing video!
wow
A couple of points to note: Tesla valves aren't straight, they kink as they go along to force flow into one of the traps - you could model this by making one of the arms twice the length of the other and then alternating them; Also, Tesla valves are _one-way_ - should be perfectly feasible for the river to drain through the Tesla valve even while it stops the tsunami.
I was just watching your Engitopia series and you’re posting a new video for this game sir 😂
Day 26 of asking RCE to play Satisfactory
I would have liked to see youndirect the entire width of the tsunami thru the valve.   In this setup you only allowed a small portion of the tsunami thru, and the had another choke point that only allowed 1/3 of the wave thru before hitting the valve
I love how dramatic his intros are and how anticlimatic and funny the video afterwards is xD I never regret subbing
I know that you probably won't see this but I've been going through a lot this year and my declining mental health isn't helping. I'm in college right now for engineering and I considered dropping out completely.  But your videos have motivated me to keep pursuing to be an engineer and they also cheer me up by showing just how cool engineering can be. I just wanted to thank you.
you should use a water source instead of a tsunami
Yes yes ys, omg, i want more this game!!!
These irl engineering videos are really interesting,  I would love more education focused videos
At this point i think I am convinced that one of RCE's guilty pleasure is abusing the game mechanics of cities skylines using different simple and complicated (mostly over Engineering) processes to engineer the perfect disaster management system , cause in real life there's no re spawn or pause button or Strongest shapes to use about . Whatever it is , I'm loving it
Its a surprise you didnt make s small slit at the end to leave out some of the spill over water in case of the city taking a hit. Edit: nevermind lol
Code of life
So this is what happens to a certain part of the human body when it takes on too much water on a massive scale. Glad that you added the meatus.
#1 on trending?
lets get this trending bois
Just found this channel and I am loving it
Tesla is one of the most important but underated engineers in history.
Love your videos but sometimes you remind me of the long lost British Hardly Bro.   Love it even more just be careful with your clues
the vine boom at 5:22 got me  lmao
Tesla = Engineer Edison = Architect
Hi
You  are awesome real civil engineer
I like the idea. But it's not a correct tesla valve
i heard timberboners have smiliar map to tested as well, why didn't you try it, sir Matt?
I guess I was not the only one suggesting this last time. Nice floodwall engineerign by the way 😄
Hitting Like and leaving a random comment really does make the algorithm happy. You should do it for your favorite creators, helps a ton!!
XD
Day 1 of asking Rce to play Space Engineers
Thanks for making video i love tesla and his inventions Tesla= pro engineer
When you mentioned water physics a game about controlling rivers and each path  controls every other river and you can buy stuff needed for future levels and there could be secrets you can unlock with that stuff improving points production and the layout is like freeways. i wish a game like that existed and i can play it for free.
Love ur vids rce
Wow
6,761 views in 13 minutes? Wow. Good for you RCE!
Hello
Well THATs a new level of Birth Control
:(
MATH AND PHYSICS
Its the strongest valve!
RCE, ty for the hard work you do in your IRL job, as well as the work you do making videos and maintaining your channel! You’re a real inspiration of dedication!
The Japanese should hire matt
maybe
Day 17 of asking for more super auto pets
You should try to make the tallest bridge ever in city sky lines G wagon G wagon G wagon lol Love your videos
…Nicola Tesla
Viewed in first 6 mins
Your strongest shape has a case of the prickle pears
Elon says he loves Edison, so he uses name tesla for marketing. Pretty architect move in my opinion.
Cool intro
Good job! Keep up the good work!
how to stop a tsunami: what if you stopped the stunami before it happend?
Don't ask me why but i trought the name of the vid was:Can a Tesla Gate stop a MEGA TSUNAMI in Cities Skylines?. I like SCP:SL....Maybe that's why...
Love the city skylines vids, when is Engitopia coming back?
6 mins
can you do a review on the natural bridge in Virginia?
Best video idea ever
i love how nicola tesla created this amazing thing and here we are, making toasters that can imprint an image of whatever you want on your toast
timberborners😩😩😩
Get 10% off my entire merch store with code "tsunami" now!! https://www.realcivilengineer.store
Surprised no one is talking about it but Blitz call you a Real Civil ARCHITECT defying the laws of engineering about 13 or 14 days ago in a Forts video  Just check the comments of that video they go wild
day 35 of asking RCE to play satisfactory huhuhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Love your videos
First
i love it when you play the city skylines game
nerd
Hi
I sent u $5 on your last vid
Every day i wathing your videos from my favorite games!
Day 3  of asking RCE to play BeamNG Drive (It's crazy cuz it's a car game and has little to no engineering involved)
You should try making a 3d version of the Tesla valve
Booosh!!!
never been this early
Here before the bots starts copying comments
Wow!  12. Comment!!!!!
Love it.
well well well what is this
Like please 😘😘
Real tesla vavle moment gaming
I'm the 11th, i was first just now too for another video
I read Tesla valve, I had to watch :D
He’s really farming the tsunami map
nice vid like always
ANOTHER TSUNAMI VID WOO
cheese
Hi
YES
Hi people
Love your content♥️
Hi
Day 151. Play scrap mechanic. Please (Edit: RCE if you want me to stop just ask.)
Wasss up
Let’s go!
