Who's here after Liverpool lost
Mark and other United fans can say they aren't fussed about City winning the league but the fact of the matter is they do
Young people  , Man Utd Vs Liverpool. I remember the 70,s 80,s  Arsenal 90,s Who gives a f . Liverpool for ever?
Blackburn fan, come on Arsenal. Come on Newcastle.
Imagine having to watch at arsenal fans if they win the title. I am not sure if i will be able to stomach it 😂
Its incredible how transformed our gunners are. Pretty much the same team as last season, just with 10x more hunger and passion.COYG! Top 4 is the main goal, but since we are here why not go all the way!
If Arsenal Win It I Will Be happy if they win it over city
Man U haven’t had a rivalry with Arsenal for over 10 years yet goldbridge is out here saying it’s is their biggest rivalry 😂 fergie left so long ago
I wouldn’t be surprised if City beat Arsenal away, they have done constantly for the last few years and always seem to get a result at Old Trafford too….everybody writing City off except the bookies
Not they’res yet till it’s they’res
Saying it’s Arsenal’s title to lose but City will win it comfortably makes it seem like you’re just eager to call them bottlers.
Forest ain’t going down chief
So wath United can lose 🤣🤣🤣
I'm convinced ten hag is planning his revenge on man city😂
See what happens after tonight’s result!!!   🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
To be honest I'm  probably going to the final arsenal (and my first ever arsenal game) of the season to maybe watch them lift the title
This was very good! All arguments for all the teams and all the manangers were spot on. Brilliant
I think after 16 games it's too early to say it's Arsenals title to lose.
but Chelsea bought that amazing striker, you know that one that was released by the top team, yeah that's his name Ohbangyamam.
Arsenal will finish with 94 points, if you want your team to challenge, that is the total you need to aim for.
your lot will not get top 4 that is for sure.
arsenal title to loose but man city are favourites😀😀😀
Mate your spot on with Chelsea situation!! I am a chelsea fan and the problem lies deeper then our manager, needs a massive over haul of the squad from starting in goal all way to the attack
I'm holding my hands all the way up. I thought that Arteta had absolutely no managerial nous - signings of David Luiz/Willian stank to high heaven and Arsenal is too big for a rookie.  When Arteta came in, he practically sidelined all the youngsters bar Saka and after a year was forced to rethink his strategy (remember promising Willian that we'd win UCL in 3 years!) Idk why, I predicted 4/4 wins at the start of the season and we got it. After that I predicted us going to the World Cup top and we did.  I'm saying we will win the league with confidence now. And I pray we do.  If we do, I'll be eating a massive slice of humble pie through ugly crying at my heart's desire.... A LEAGUE TITLE. COYG!!!!!
@goldbridge let's wait till April  For now gathering points and momentum is necessary We the Arsenal, we focus game by game, not the title... the points we are able to gather will reveal our position on the table...till then, everyone focus on your team
Everyone saying Arsenal will win but Newcastle will win the league. Only 1 defeat by lucky Liverpool and they will trounce Arsenal tonight
Youtubers hahaha, you guys are going to finish the year by just extending your expectations Arsenal to lose! Surprise
The problem with Arsenal is that as soon as one of our main players are injured, and with the europa leage; we don't have the players to be able to keep up compared to top depth teams like City where one injury can be easily replaced (except maybe Haaland and De Bruyne)
As a Gooner I think Arsenal are playing with real freedom as nobody has or had high expectations of us this season. Whereas City and some others have I feel much more pressure to succeed than us as they have more depth in their squads on paper. Add to this Arsenal's re-found fighting spirit...If we beat Newcastle tonight....We'll win the league.
Mark changes his mind quicker then chelsea change managers
United being the only team to beat Arsenal this season.
Respect to arsenal for maintaining top spot the fact they are holding it without buying the title is a great thing for the prem
No team has ever had as many points at Arsenal at this point if they don’t win it massive failure
I was born in the days of man united vs arsenal the day I found out we were enemies with spurs I was confused 😕 because I never be knew them kkk
I think Newcastle are playing some of the best football in the league at the minute but games like the Leeds game shows that teams will now try to earn a point against us and will park the bus and we need to learn how to counter this which is part of the project and development. It’s what seperates us from teams like Man City
We aren’t even halfway through the season! I wouldn’t call it “theirs to lose” just yet!
To Sir the truth you were right
Liverpool lost Mark☺️
7 points is such a big gap nowadays, it means if they draw 3 games they’re still top, and that’s if their chasers win every game from then on
Arsenal are finally title chasers after three seasons under Arteta but nobody wants to talk about Eddie Howe's Newcastle sitting at third after being in bottom three last year? Scandalous
I love it when plastics like Goldbridge, (not his real name), try to give detailed justifications for their 'alliegance'.
Rember mark you say they haven’t got experience in being a title race but remember they have Jesus and zinchenko who have experience and you could say arteta because he was at Man City when they were in the title race so there is experience
I think top 4 will stay as it is right now, in the current order.
As a Arsenal fan I hate the term “Is Arsenal’s League To Lose” we have not won the league since 2003/04 that is nearly 20 years ago, how can it be ours to lose if we haven’t had it in so long…? I think the term should’ve been “This is Arsenals League To Win “
5:21 Did he just say never been in a title race before come on Mark we have 13 premier league titles what are you talking about...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Arsenal can keep injuries to a minimum, they've got a great chance. Take out a few key players and they all of a sudden don't look like a top 4 team.
On behalf of a lot of Chelsea fans, thank u for speaking so much more sense than half of our fan base rn about Potter.
What a story it would be for arsenal to win the league when there was such a contentious debate whether they would finish in the top 4, if arsenal win the next 3 games (new castle) (tottenham) (man utd) the title is ours surely.
Calm down.
This idiot changes his mind every 12 hours 🤣🤣🤣  United can now get top 4. Yesterday they couldnt
This PL has been decided man Arsenal has won it man the Res a just playing for second man
As a Liverpool fan I never expected to win the league this season I knew there would be something with arsenal after seeing Jesus in preseason and thought Newcastle were a threat for our top 4 race as they got top 10 and spent again while we didn’t and I knew man United would be better Man City the problem is they just have loads of dodgy games and rely on haaland for goals but before when they were forced to use sterling as their main goalscorer they were better and I think many will agree
Very Unbiased Sentiments,keep it up Gold bridge
Dont worry Mark we will have Jesus back in April.
I dunno why there is a debate over Arsenal ! They are a better team compared to the big 6 and hope they challenge all the big 6 every year ! ❤️
Arsenal have to spend big in January in order to get the squad depth to win the league. They need a new 6, RW, 8, and a CB.
Arsenal will run out of steam and finish 3rd.
Thinly veiled attempt to add pressure 🤣🤣 arteta mentality monster 🤣
Here an Arsenal fan. Let's get Man Utd Arsenal rivalry back to the Premier League!
who is artetar ?
As an Arsenal fan from India, I'm with Mark regarding the rivalry between Man U and Arsenal. Wenger vs Ferguson was something else. I consider them more of a rival than Spurs. And also Chelsea is right up there regarding rivalries. We got battered by Mourinho so many times!! 😖😖😖 Ronaldo and Drogba will always haunt our history.
Same thing with me goldbridge, being an international fan I hate united and chelsea way more than I do tottenham, they're irrelevant and always have been and I'm not from london so they don't bother me
Few loudmouth arsenal fans printed “Arteta out” tshirts, others just repeat the mantra, “it’s about squad depth, man city are favorites”. No original thoughts. Why they cannot enjoy the journey, too busy parroting what they hear from pundits and naysayers!
Interesting, intelligent commentary
Liverpool dropped 3 points today so dropped behind even more
Would have loved a reaction video to Brentford beating Liverpool
Bit rich Mark…..Utd fans constantly trying to kick out every manager every two minutes…
I wudent sack potter they got no striker
I honestly think Chelsea and liverpool are a bigger mess than Spurs.
From arsenal have no chance they’ve had an easy run when they get harder teams they will fall away to its arsenal title to lose lol all of you so called football experts are pathetic and embarrassing
I have the same tot as u where i see Man U as our biggest rival of all times.
GP is not the kind of manager Chelsea need
Liverpool are exploring a deal to buy Portugal midfielder Matheus Nunes, 24, from Wolves in the summer
Man City are the best team in the league with the best squad and are the current champions they are definitely still favourites to win the league, I can’t make sense of this video
If Potter goes, imagine they bring Jose back.
I agree it is Arsenal’s to lose, they’ve been the most consistent team by far this season
According to many acounts ronaldo has a release clause to join newcastle if we get champions league football and we don't want him is there any chance you would take him back ?
i think liverpool will beat brentford
as much as i would love city to win the league, arsenal deserve it out of everyone so far
Mark you said ole was better than Arteta, stop trying to look smart.
To say Potter out is ridiculous, as a Chelsea fan Im embarrassed that our fan base is even suggesting it.
Oi mate, shouldn’t you be supporting Nottingham Forest seeings as that’s where you’re from and currently live? Stay local, stop talking about us Man U fans like you’re one of us, haven’t even been to Old Trafford 😡
Cristiano Ronaldo has a clause in his Al Nassr contract allowing the Portugal forward, 37, to join Newcastle United on loan if they qualify for the Champions League this season
Don't forget this geezer also called teta  at the very beginning the pound land pepe but than he changed his opinion before others as he saw something
Stop it Mark. Arsenal are not favorites. City have way more experience and quality than us. We have a great team and a great chance to win, but we’re not favorites.
It’s been a long wait
I genuinely don’t know how anyone listens to this guy, his views on football is woeful. He’s not even right about his own club let alone other clubs
I was Arteta out now I love him... 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
I'm going to say this here and now so I can point to it. If United keep and stick with ten haag, they will win things again for sure. I hope for arsenal's sake your fan base becomes inpatient and gives him the sack.
You weren't the best team against Arsenal
I see Mark you are a classic man u fan - support them only because they were top of the league. Newcastle are a sleeping ginat the guy is worth 3 times what the guy at man city are worth... just watch..!
Where is gold ridge from in England the way he says laugh gives me northerner vibes but he sed he not from Manchester so idk. Anyone know?
Newcastle will not finish top four, team is not good enough as it stands. If they buy well in the next window they may make it just. But I think Liverpool, Man City and Chelsea will spend big and better.
Manchester United fans thinking Arsenal a derby team than City.
surprise surprise the one who have been praising Potter all those years ago is the one who said to sack him after 10 games...
I’ve backed Arteta from day one non stop. You don’t become Pep hand chosen protégé for no reason
Ooops, Liverpool do very well, said Goldbridge just before they lost to Brentford today. Anymore Mystic Meg predictions you wanna make? Anyhow, I'm not having this "the title is for Arsenal's to lose" when you refuse to give them the heads-up. You can't have it both ways, Goldbridge.
As an arsenal fan if we beat Newcastle and Chelsea beat man city I think we are guaranteed the title, although it seems weird  wanting Chelsea to win 😂
Couldnt ignore the praise Arteta got from the Man City squad when leaving for Arsenal. Super Mik all the way LFG!
I want to win Europa I feel we should play the majority of our first 11 from here on out in Europa but can start players like Tierney and Viera Elneny who are more than capable
As a Chelsea fan, Mark is right about all his points made this video. Bohley has said he is building a team for 2030 and most people miss that.
Mr, correction.., when Manchester beat Arsenal it was not because Arsenal was naive,  it was a help handed to you by the referee and VAR, honestly speaking you did nothing in that entire game, the only thing you did right, was playing 12 players inclusive of the ref.
There are at least 5 players who are flirting with being world class in the Arsenal team right now.
love it mark, legend
I remember the 1979 FA Cup Final, now that was a game!!!
The 2 stumbling blocks are europa league and the fact how bad they bottled it end of past season will it be psychological
If Arsenal win it it gives me hope any team can win it.
Im not impressed  with  Antony  signing  ,most of all the prize tag is  overwhelmed  considering  his style of play.
Arsenal have two huddles to overcome if they are to win the league 1. The next 3 games 2. The 6 games in April  If they can manage 7 Wins out 9 win the league.
This one is Just jealous . Man u fans
Actually mate, its Arsenals to win
And why is this idi*t claiming Arteta didn’t get the kind of Money Eddie Howe will get to spend? How does he know how much Eddie Howe will get?? How come Arsenal are still outspending Newcastle?? Clown!
As an Arsenal fan and being as unbiased as I can I saw what Arsenal wanted to do when appointing Arteta I’ve never been Arteta out but I have been on the fence in recent seasons but what they wanted to do is working 🔥
Hey Mark.. i think thats where Jesus and zinchenco will come in. The later stages they’ll be pushed by the old pep boys to continue what they’re supposed to do. Jesus is hungry to be the leading man to a PL
If my mind serves me wel ur earlier prediction was arsenal not in top kkkkk eat the humble pie ma man
Lol can't wait to see arsenal bottle the premier league.
We’re still 2-3 players away
Very long way to go I think you could only really have this argument after 30 games
Anybody who doesn't want Arsenal to beat City to the title this year was clearly born post oil money in the prem. Either that or they're so used to a 1 team league now that they just don't care anymore
Technically, it’s City’s title to lose as they’re the holders right?
Look as a United fan I dread to think what Arsenal fans will be if they win the league but if they win it’ll be because on a very rare occasion, like Leicester a team has put faith into a manager and his project and that’s the way teams used to win. Better that than Saudi Arabia Vs America which it will be in 6 years
We want top 4.
cant wait for nkunku in the prem
Absolutely agree about the last 10 games when most players struggle to shoot as though they are wearing wellies.
Harry Potter is a very good coach at Chelsea.
Can't wait until the Arsenal squad hits their 20's and really start playing
Arsenal win it > city three peating the league
United might get a chance if they got backed in Jan. Arsenal obviously is going to collapse around April and city will remain inconsistent.
Last week it was Arsenal won’t win league, this week it’s Arsenal’s title to lose. Come on guys make your mind up.
Potter is not a top 6 manager its that simple this job is a bridge too far( pun intended) he will get the sack
Stop being a hypocrite. You were Arteta out too.
When teams that have owners with unlimited funds aren't winning titles gives the rest of us hope.
Zinchenko gave the premiere league winning assist last season him and Jesus know exactly what it takes to win the league.
Mark goldbridge loves potter (english manager)😂😂😂
Rather it went Finsbury park than anywhere else. Not coming West London way; bang on about CFC!
Am form Ethiopia and am an Arsenal fan man untied is our rivals
Stop forgetting Chelsea spent 270 million pounds in the summer. ZERO EXCUSES !!!!!!!
i was scared for poter😅😅😅
If man utd when all their games left They will win it
we saw this with United under Ole in 20/21 season - 4 points clear top of league in January, and it all fell to pieces come end of February cos no other team can match City's squad depth when the games start to pile up, I mean come on their bench is a top 4 team starters! I hope Arsenal do win it but I think only Newcastle cash flow can contend with City's oil flow sugar daddy...
Arsenals to lose after 16 games absolutely not come back after 25 and lets see about a serious challenge i prefer debating the top 4 thats much more interesting.
😀😎👋
Logical bridge
The title is not arsenals to lose we came into this season with the aim of getting top four and we have been taking it game by game and have found ourselves in a very promising position and now rival fans are not tired of calling us bottlers and they are hoping that we bottle the title and that's why  rivals are  saying it's ours to lose creating that notion that if if we don't win it we are bottle jobs
Let's be honest spurs only got top 4 last season because we (arsenal) threw it away
As an Arsenal fan I hope Chelsea are dumb enough to sack Potter.
Arsenal play as a team and play for each other and the manager ,looking good
I would appreciate Arsenal more then City If they win the league. They build a team not like Pep who bought all the world class players.
I'm an arsenal fan n still see man utd as our rivals
As a global arsenal fan agree always seen utd as our biggest rivals, spuds who NLD is a small game 😂
Like Ten Hag has been great for United, l feel like Arteta has been great for Arsenal.  He worked with Pep and I think that is massive.  Arsenal I believe can find a way to do it...
Thanks for your honesty mark
Mark i am a local and i put rivalry in this order: Liverpool, Leeds, Arsenal then City
Arsenal will win ❤️🤍💪
I dont mid arsenal winning the league over city.. its more entertaining but God arsenal have unbearable fans🤦🏽‍♂️
Y’all believe after couple of years the old rivalry arsenal against Man Utd will be back ,cuz both have amazing managers which they will control the league in the next 10 years,cuz Liverpool’s and city’s era is about to end ,while the Chelsea is too early and tottenham have no plan to win the game except using only son. And Kane
United are still the only ones to beat Arsenal
As a Arsenal fan I thought October would be a month where we would crumble a bit. There was a huge overload of fixtures with both prem and group stage games for europa league. We lost 1 game and drew 1 that month. Shows me this team is cable of riding through the next few months.  I dont belive we have the depth yet to compete in all these comps and it's where I think we may drop out of europa league if our gap on City gets bigger. Got to start believing its a possibility now if we strengthen in January. Love the content mark. Keep it up👍🏼
tottenham football heritage is barren, conte is an elite manager but this probably the hardest are among the hardest jobs he has ever had for a team to win things mourinho was on cusp of getting a trophy  but unfortunately he lost his job before the finals of the FA cup a major domestic trophy
Potter out would be such a stupid move.  Chelsea's problems aren't his fault.
This man just completely slept on Fulham.
Tbh Chelsea fans are so toxic that they are unbelievable btw this is coming from a Chelsea fan
There can only be patience at Chelsea if history doesn't repeat itself with the manager losing the dressing room and player power forcing the hand of club ownership. The history there is players know when they want a manager out, they can get their way, and while that was all with Abramovich some of the pre-Potter players there will still think the same way, so we will see how Todd Boehly deals with that.
you forget against united we didn't have party he's so vital to us. If we keep party fit we win the league.
I’ve always thought of Man Utd as rivals ever since I was a child
I really enjoy your content, I’m chelsea fan and I feel you always give very unbiased opinions on other clubs other than Man U. This is the best take on potter/chelsea I’ve heard, all the chelsea supporting channels are to invested to call it how it is. Great content
As a North London-born Liverpool fan, if we sell out and take the Oil $ I’m out. Will be happy to support Arsenal as they’ve done it the right way
Goldbridge you've been consistent about arsenal since last season which was why I subscribed to your channel.
Exactly how I feel. It's good for the league
If Manchester United can’t catch up to win it 😮which I hope they can then I would rather arsenal than Liverpool or Man City. Think Man Utd will finish 3rd this season
Even as a united fan I'm rooting for arsenal to win the league It will show that you don't need oil to win
Here we go Arsenal fans, this was always going to happen. Rivals continue to gas us up more than we are, trying to apply as much pressure for if we don't end winning it all, so they can say we "bottled it" when even they themselves had us FIFTH PLACE maximum. Our goal is Top4 until March then we'll see where we are then. Comical
If Lampard is smart enough he will realise that persisting with a 5 at the back could be the key to Everton pulling away, if they play that every game I could see them in the top 10, they shut down the champions and pretty much nullfiifed Haaland in a way I've not seen any other team do, they can do that against any team in the league if they did it against City.
Dont jinx it mark..
Newcastle are winning the title
Arsenal have 2 (jesus and zhinchenko) big players and a manager that knows what it is like to win the league.  That should spread through the team.  So that should be consider instead we have a team that don't know how to win a league and chased by teams that do.
U too were amongst those who were bantering arteta and arsenal😂😂😂😂😂 hypocrisy at its peak fr
hail your comment on  "man utd and arsenal are bigger rivalry than Man City".. yeah i was old enough to experienced that as well... the magnitude of the game... it was pure rivalry... the fact man utd, played with guts and swift counter attacking.. made the games even more intriguing...
Arsenal will be even better next season.
It would be disappointing if we lose the title but it's not a disaster. Even city and Liverpool losing the prem dont call it a disaster season.
Did Mark just claim he was a teenager in the early 90's 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tottenham fan here.  I would be happy if Conte leaves and Potter signs for us in the summer.
2:50 waw, the arrogance! you thought you would never see Liverpool winning the title? you aren't 80 years old mate. So you thought Liverpool wouldn't win the premier league for about a 100 years huh? here is a fact for you: by 2030, Liverpool will have surpassed man utd in English titles. I say 2030 to give myself some room, but it could be sooner. as soon as Pep leaves, that title is ours again. hmmm.. you aren't from Manchester? you got that accent though, you have that annoying habit of using "Sat" and "stood" instead of "sitting" and "standing" like people from Manchester do. Arsenal will bottle the title, it's what they do. Liverpool has that annoying habit too by the way, not singling Arsenal out, but they will bottle this, just watch. If Liverpool doesn't buy a midfielder, you can rule them out. Gakpo was not what we wanted for January, we need at least 1 midfielder this January or we will lose out. I cannot take another 18 games with Henderson in midfield, I just can't. I wouldn't normally want manchester city to win the champions league, but if man city go ahead and win all 3, the premier league, the FA cup and the league cup. Then and only then would I want them to win the champions league as well. To be able to waste the stain of 1999 from football history forever would be great. I'm sad Liverpool weren't able to do it, but hopefully man city can.
As an Arsenal fan I can honestly say I always had faith in the bosses vision. It was almost instantaneously visible what he was doing. Maybe not distinctly but the fact concepts and tactics were been outlined. That said I would be lying if I said my faith hadn’t been shaken at times, it has. I’ve said since the beginning of his tenure I could see a plan at the very least. Like Klopp Arteta  put his stamp on the team from the outset. It’s Arsenal’s to lose 100%.
We can predict  league  winners  chance by Feb
You say that about arteta out but ole did better then ragnick
Potter hasn't even had a transfer window yet. Let's not forget most Arsenal fans wanted Arteta out early on and look at them now.
It’s not about spending money it’s about buying the rite players and having the rite staff example chelsea West Ham wolves have all spent more than Newcastle and look who’s doing the best
Arsenal at this point need to get into the top 4 at least
Will pep stick or twist if City go deep in the Champions League? It will be interesting to see what he priorities if Arsenal are still leading the league.  The City Arsenal head to heads will be fascinating.
I'm a Liverpool fan and as painful as it is and has been all my football supporting life I'd sooner see united win the league,or anyone else, than the plastic clubs we all know and hate, city chelsea and soon to be newcastle.
If the saudis owned both clubs (Man U & Newcastle), which one will ended up getting the worst deal. I bet Newcastle 😒
I was never arteta put I was thinking that I would give him 5 games after the city game to turn results around and he did and he has always been my manager
Normally halfway by this stage
Boxing Day 2020, Arteta injected youth into the team that faced Chelsea that day, after that win, I said to a friend of mine (who's also an Arsenal fan), watch what Arteta does with this group of youngsters in the near future
Mark are you going to do a watch along for the caraboa cup game against charlton?
arsenal will finish 3rd
Same here, Man United biggest rivals to Arsenal, because of the Wenger v Ferguson, Viera v Keane era
lol if you had a manager who took you as low as 15th you'd be screaming to get them out no matter who they were - just tells us you didn't watch Arsenal back in 2020/21. We were diabolical under him.
Liverpool FC ~ EPL champion season 2022-23.Cheers !!
Spurs = 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
I will agree with you as far as biggest rivalry, as an arsenal fan for 35 years, Man United will always be our biggest rival to me. Chelsea and City don't have the history we have with United. Spurs is just a local rivalry.
Spurs brought in Richarlison, Romero and Bissouma so I'm not too sure how we can say they can't financially compete. I'd be fuming if I was a Spurs fan,  hearing my manager talk the way he has been. You've seen Howe improve players that were in a relegation fight and give his squad and fans belief.
Bro, he's spent more than anyone in 3 seasons
Arsenal have spent lots of money and rightly so under Arteta.
mark you are exactly right. arsenal vs man united, during the wenger and ferguson peak was the best rivalry the prem has seen
As a Chelsea fan, we need to backup  Potter, a tone tone of patience for him least till December 2023, give him money, trust, hope that hell give us the identity, the strong starting 11, till then hope to finish in top 10
I hate MU the most eve though I watch Goldbricks.
Strangely the Chelsea 's ' Potter plan ' went haywire by their heavy loss at Brighton of all clubs.  Potter was a hero at Brighton.  Now he is Judus Iscariot..Selling his soul for 30 pieces of silver...
Newcastle not having European football is irrelevant. Liverpool and united are getting knocked out anyway
Just need to add another comment here. You said Arteta hasn't had the money that pep and howe have had then caveated that with utd and Liverpool not having as much. Utd have spent more than city since fergie left
I dont understand why you says spurs cant compete. They have the money and had chest at the start of season as the best transfer window between the Top 6.
Potter wouldn't have bought anyone that tuchel bought that's the biggest problem. Complete madness to give tuchel so much money only to sack him.
City has been chasing down very good Liverpool sides to the tail end of seasons many times. The mentality required to do it is tremendous, no denying that. I think they can do it again this season. Until it's mathematically impossible to catch Arsenal, City is going to be a threat.
Arsenal to finish 4th again🤣
Yeah it absolutely is theirs to lose , and they likely will.
Brighton 1 point away from Chelsea  I am about to laugh Mitoma is top lad
As Liverpool fan I do not car who win the title as long is not Man Utd .And of course Man city to never ever win the Champions league.
Man Utd are 100% going to finish in the top 4 along with Arsenal and Man City
So many predicted we wouldn’t get top 4, now rivals are getting ready to mock us if we don’t win the league? 😂win or not we have improved amazingly this season and with all the young talent we have we have more than enough to look forward to in the future than just this season. No matter what happens all arsenal fans are proud of our boys COYG
Rubbish is this to talk
As an arsenal fan i agree 💯 with you on the rivalry between us a lot of people are stunned when i say i dont see Tottenham as our rivals its Manchester United i see as our rivals, dont get me wrong the north London Derby between arsenal and Tottenham does have a big emotion attached to it for me  but it doesn't feel the same as the united one i hate losing to united it burns more i dont watch match of the day i get the right hump 🤣🤣
The point with Arsenal is that the players they have have all become 10x better than what they were last season, they have not purchased their way to the title race, a number of their players have grown into world class talent worthy of winning a premier league title. When you look at players like Odegaard, Xhaka, Saka, Gabriel and Saliba ect all of which have stepped up their game massively, its not a surprise to see why they are where they are at the moment. Keep it up, Arsenal. From a Crystal Palace fan
personally i think chelsea players is more the problem back potter with the signings and watch the team improve, i want arsenal to win the prem its nice to see how well the youth are doing and the team chemistry
Arsenal is winning the premier league
Man City should do it unfortunately   No team hates them enough to consistently give them hard games every week
Arsenal should just sack off the Europa league and focus 100% of their efforts on the prem.  Just play any non-starters in Europe, the champions league is basically a guarantee at this point anyways and winning the prem is more important in my opinion.  The chances of pulling off the double doesnt make the risk of losing both worth it imo.
Arsenal won't win the league, whilst looking very worthy of top spot now, they always find a way to bugger it up. City always find a way to make up the points.
You say the 'club' Arsenal hasn't experience of winning the league, I assume you mean the current team or squad not the club. This manager and these players know they represent a club with a history of winning trophies.   As a Gooner, I have to admit that it is good to see United getting back on form. Love the rivalry.
The amount of spurs fans that said they was gonna be title contenders this season
Gunners looking strong and playing probably the best of the lot.
Aren't we seeing the pattern already? "Spurs can't compete financially", "liverpool can't compete financially" with the likes of city, New castle and Chelsea. This all falls to richy rich owners buying the best talents and best scouts. Just get rid off those richy rich folks and bring the clubs back to reality. Ban those clubs and strip them off their trophies.
Don’t write off Newcastle lost 1 game all season rock solid defence and can bang goals in
So u win mancity and arsenal 🙄
Id have no problem with arsenal winning the league if it wasnt for arsenal fans
Arsenal fans are unbearable now, and they haven't even CHALLENGED for a PL in nearly 20 years. If they win the league, we will not see peace.
Arsenal will win a premier league before even a Fergie less Manchester United? Never could have seen that coming.
Arsenal definitely bigger rival to me than City
what a disaster haaland has been, ruined citys defense
Am I the only arsenal fan that thinks we can't win it? I'd be absolutely over the moon if we did but I would be extremely over the moon if we got champions league football again. We need more depth we need transfers this window
Nah Man every top club has a striker Chelsea don't have a striker since 2017
So many pundits are using reverse psychology against Arsenal; at the start of the season, top 4 was Arsenals goal, anything above that is a bonus.
Chelsea should have kept tuchel otherwise they would not be in this mess plus firing him 3 months ago makes them look even more stupid 😝😝😝
Agreed that the 97-05 rivalry between Arsenal and United was the best in PL history.
I am an Arsenal supporter & was always wanting to persevere with Arteta & Edu, but I still think City are favourites for the title - it’s all about *_squad depth_* .  Arsenal have a chance but so do one or two others - it’s all to play for !
Up utd
Yess as a chelsea fan one positive to be out of the top 4 is get a conference league place so we can be the first english team to win 3 trophies from 3 difference european conpetition
I thought it was City's title to lose
SOUTHAMPTON ARE NOT DONE
Arsenal not worried about non - significant people.  Rivals should be ashamed of themselves. Arsenal played more away game
Possible end of Pep and Klopp era in EPL, and start of Arteta and Ten Hag?
Why didn’t Manchester United go for him ?
Upcoming run of Newcastle Man united and Tottenham will bring an idea of if arsenal can win it. I still reckon City are just have the know how of the pressure. (Man united fan)
As a gooner I don't think we should fear anyone. We're playing the best football, and even when we concede, we are scoring nearly straight away. Our defence is so much better, than in the past decade. I think we will win the league.
Every team should support Arsenal you cannot BUY the league. If every team has a billionaire this levels the playing field.
Newcastle to beat Arsenal this week to make the title race interesting 😉 ⚫⚪
We are going to win the league. It's simple Mark. City will drop point's.
Liverpool didnt beat Leicester. Leicester beat themselves.
It doesn’t matter if he hasn’t had a transfer window, he should be able to beat Forrest
This is another season like when Leicester won it. None of the bigger better squads are consistent in winning their games and I've already conceded defeat this season (Man City Fan) I think it's Arsenal this year but might put a cheeky bet on Newcastle too. It's frustrating to watch because Arsenal's squad isn't that special. But what they have is team spirit and belief. They work hard for each other and that beats a team of individuals any day
Not ours to lose yet, still not even halfway through the season and I still have City as favs right now. Next 3 games will show who is in the title race, if we beat Newcastle they're out of it, if we beat Spurs they have no chance anymore of catching us and if we beat Man Utd they wont catch us either. If we beat all 3 thats top 2 guaranteed I think, then its all down to what form City find, they also have Chelsea, Utd and Spurs in their next 3 games. If we do win all of our next 3, then City have to do the same I think. I don't think we will win all 3 games but I can see City winning all theirs and that makes it wide open with there still being 2 games between Arsenal and City. 7 points clear after 16 games is nothing when the rivals are Man City, a team that has shown they can go on 12, 15, 18 game winning runs, theyre monsters.
Sean dycheeeeee
Potter out? You got me to click well done mark  No way Chelsea fans are asking for his head 😭 surely not
Liverpool will be back
Arsenal will win the league comfortably. No team is playing on their level. It would be a shock to see them crumble. No manager is better in the league. Best goalkeeper ramsdale best defender saliba best midfielder odegaard and best forward Saka in the league...                          ...(Reverse psychology hopefully)
If Newcastle get top 4, the purse strings explode.
Everyone calling us favourites but its still too early 😒
Potter has it like Ten hag but Potter has money and ten hag no
"Chelsea don’t have a goal scorer”, so what is Auba then? He was supposed to return to the premier league to prove to Arteta and Arsenal he is still a prolific goal scorer and see what they are missing.
If City can win the league, Man Utd is four points behind the title eventually  :)
Top 4 main aim for Arsenal. Relax
May 31st: 1. Man City 2. Arsenal 3. Liverpool 4. Manu 5. Newcastle 6. Chelsea 7. Tottenham 8. Aston Villa
Nufc will take points of arsenal tomorrow battered  them at home last game of last season
I just wonder why dont u banter chelsea Mark? You were bantering Arsenal when we had bad periods and many of us wanted Arteta out, but you are not doing this with chelsea. Chelsea most exciting project???? Mark wtf Arsenal, Lfc, even united all look better than these russian mafia merchants.
Until I see Arsenal beat City in both fixtures I am still putting City as favourites. Arsenal are doing really well but I have a long enough memory to remember how they buckled under the pressure for top 4 last season. I hope I am wrong because City winning it again just makes this league even more like a yearly procession.
City are still favourites imo. Once it gets to a 12 point gap I'll be more confident👍🏼
Tbh I don’t mind arsenal winning the league but to make it interesting I would like to see Newcastle as well
1. That's weird, just like a week ago I remember you saying City will win it, no prob.🤐  2. I do remember your "Arteta out!" banter, I agreed with you then, now it's just obvious.  3. I still can't 4get your famous "Who loses to Arsenal?" Hah!
Arsenals target was top 4. Obviously now things are different but it’s not a disaster if we don’t win the league. It’ll be a great achievement to be anywhere in the top 3 - which is doable   For all the big teams this month is huge
Zein gonna be happy 😃
ARSENAL's TITLE TO LOSE? Didn`t you say that Man City are favorites alongside bookies? I guess its Citys title to lose
As a honest Arsenal fan, the Emirates can't hold a candle to The Emptyhad.
I dont think Arsenal will win the league, until they prove me they do in fact.
Still two games left with Man C, lots can happen
Hi
Cheers Mark. Even tho I am an Arsenal fan I still dont think we`ll win the title. Our goal this seaon is to be top 4 if we get that im 100% happy. I will be hoping for the best, but im not sure if we have a good enough squad depth to become the champions. As said top 3-4 is our goal and I`ll be very happy with that.
Arsenal have  had such a turn around
Great show Mark!  Arsenal will bottle it!
We need to stay patient with Potter, let’s not be like Arsenal fans with Arteta out every two seconds
If we beat both arsenal and city we are on 38 points and if city draw their next game before us we draw level to them
Remember 2018/19 season where Liverpool were 51pts & Man City were 44 pts at Christmas after 19 PL games & at the end of the season City finished with 98pts & Liverpool with 97pts... Same is gonna happen to Arsenal this season
Newcastle will shake up the standings by beating Arsenal
7:43 I definitely agree and also it’s not always the manager to blame because sometimes the players can be playing really bad ( e.g trent ) and they still blame the manager
As a Tottenham fan I knew Arteta was building something special I just didn’t think it was going to be this season I thought he needed another window to complete the team
Mark you should be doing the old firm watch alongs on this channel as it’s a football channel. It’s the biggest derby in Britain and is up there as one of the biggest derby’s in football.
Potter seriously needs his contract terminated. I don’t know why the new owners are trying to ruin this club. I seriously don’t understand it. Potter isn’t even fit to coach Chelsea or any big team, he seriously needs to be out of the club. I miss Tuchel and know he can’t come back but find at least a coach who can help, and knows what to do. Clearly Potter isn’t that coach. Which Tuchel we always that sense of excitement and pride, with Potter it’s just like eh. It’s sad mate.
Nice vid Mark.  As an Arsenal fan, looking forward to playing your lot again in the next few weeks. I think we suffered from a lack of familiarity with some of your new signings (Antony debut etc) and focusing on Ronaldo above all else.  Be interesting to see what happens now the situation has changed.
Mark what do you think of Fulham?
If only Mark did this exclusively and didn't have the united stand. I like these little chats he has now and then.
Arsenal beats newcastle and we beat bournemouth plus game in hand - top 3 here we come baby!
City don't look that good this season tbf
Be honest guys a knitting club is louder than the Emirates. I dare say even the Emptyhad.
I'm an arsenal fan and 7 points is nothing..and we still have to play City twice..United Liverpool Chelsea spurs again..but on saying that those teams mentioned haven't been great this season..
Has a Manchester united, i would love Arsenal to win the League, but we all saw how they reacted against Brighton when the pressure was on, they're kids, it's feels like they will learn the hard way this season, Manchester City are freak of nature every second part of the season, they will go on their unusually 18-20 unbeaten with 17-18 straight wins in the Premier League
With Mudryk 🇺🇦 Arsenal will be technically stronger and Gunners is the better option for him than Chelsea or Tottenham. I want see gunners on the top of EPL and title of course
Let's be honest Emptyhad is louder than the Emirates.
Is Toney fit enough to start today
Arsenal v Newcastle is a huge game.
Arsenal winning it would actually be better tbh
City will not win 🤣🤣
Love having these vids mark. Arsenal fan here. Much love
Potter out is absurd.  However, he needs to do more and become more pro active with this weak bunch of players.
