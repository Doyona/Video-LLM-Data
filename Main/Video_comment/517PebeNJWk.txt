I thought you had to be a certain distance away to see the glint
How do you make your kar look like that
Why leave a slot open
Which scopes have glint? And only on snipers use?
Yesir
How tf can I get it
When I was new I always thought the Kar98K looked dope af
Is this still accurate??
Hey JGOD does the susat multizoom still have glint after the recent patch?
Where’s the hdr then
is this still working?
this is good job video
Nice
Glint is the worst but I hate when I’m running around being aggressive an some noob wit a 703 snipes me when camping
So when using variable zoom on any kar it has no clip on warzone?
Please stop telling everyone bud there a lot of hackers out there and that gives us normal players a bit if a vantage over them for ones
I have a question, which is better kar-98k of the HDR?
My kar98k has no laser attachment slot at all. I dont know why...
Should be no Glint anyways unless the Sun hits it
Is this fixed?
Let’s talk about the physics of a glint.  This is just lazy programming. The direction of the sun is what determines glint.
Is this still broken?
Is it still broken ?
Amazing video
Is this still a thing?
Bro @jgod why would you tell the community about the no glint
I just debunked this last night with a buddy. There still IS a glint everyone.
how is so much of this game broken? sweet jesus.
Patched?
Great update 👍👍👍👍👍👍
JGOD is sacrificing his KDR for us 🙌🏻
Wait what ? U say variable zoom doesnt have glint ? On the description it says theres glint though
There's no glint if your aiming at an enemy with a scope to make it so the glint doesn't effect your aim..... That's why some of the ones that are supposed to have a glint aren't showing one because the enemy is using a "scope" optic
i usually run a thermal but not as of late
summary: MW snipers have no glint with variable zoom scopes.
doesn't glint go away at close range?
Is there glints on the spr
The CW ultrazoom scope thundra now has a glint.
How can this be that hard to fix... make all the scopes have glint already... the BLOPS integration was ages ago...
Is it no glint when only low zoom (@3.5x) but glint when high zoom (@8x)? By the rules he stated the variable at low zoom shouldn't have a glint (<4x). Didnt see this addressed.
I'm pretty sure sleight of hand still works...i use it on my mp5 n there's a big difference
Does this work for the ar's?? In particular the fal and the fr 5.56 because that could get broken quick... the fr 5.56 having no damage drop off and a variable scope
Am i the only one thinking he contradicted himself like 50 times?
Is this still happening as of 4/12?
good luck
Did this get fixed or still bugged?
hey jgod i been trying to use the royal kross optic but i find that the sway when you dont hold your breath is insane
Still work or been patched?
HDR has no glint with its own scope!!!!
Lmao the KAR with no optic is ironsights. Why'd you even test that. 2:14
Show us all your Loadouts
Please fire raven and get the guys from infinity ward...
They really want people to stop playing warzone 😂
Hangman scope has glint for Cold War snipers
I use the kar. So, any scope will have no glint on it?
can you please bring light to the sleight of hand glitch for mw weapons?
Do not make videos showing how to do this...
This 1.34 update was the worst update yet. I was never experiencing these weird bugs before. Now I experience all of them..... Plus I have to reinstall my MW game cuz after downloading update for WZ my MW deleted 2/3 multiplayer packs. So rediculous
Do people realize that in the real world, there are scope attachments to hide glint? I think it’s hilarious that people immediately assume it’s a bug and not a more realistic update. In the real world, you won’t see the glint. Keep moving and don’t leave your melon hanging out there and you have nothing to worry about!
Variable zoom. Got it! Thanks
Has it been fixed?
They also broke the adverse barrels on the finn
cold war ruined warzone
I’ve used zoom lenses since day one time to pog
Owh, so it was a bug, i just think the enemy has a hax. lol
What is a glint
I just died from a no glint then i turn on YouTubes and the first vid i see is this one! Thanks for the help
I have em all and I don't tell ppl about it 😏
Is this fixed yet?
Another grade A video!! Keep it up JGod
what about the spr does that have a glint @jgod
Is this patched yet?
Ram.  That is why wz mw cw are breaking... Skins.guns.colors.dying effects.ytacers all take memory. And most dont have the memory/Ram in their system to load it all properly. Hence it breaking down graphically. While adding lag and other issues into the game.  I've dealt with computers since the mid 80's. If you guys had to deal with what I did,you'd understand what's happening overall with the game due to lack of hardware. Consoles have no chance as they are 'locked' on internal memory amounts.
So just to be sure....the Kar98 variable zoom has no glint?
They dun goofed the game. Cmon guys...
You’re channel ruins the game.
I think they should just remove the glint all together, and I also think they should add the Cold War card that allows 3 extra attachments, @JGOD do you think the meta would include more guns overall, and widen the variety if you could go 8/8 attachments on any gun?
the model 680 6r mag is COMPLETELY BROKEN and not in a good way pls check it out jgod because nobody wants to
Gotta say I am loving the No Glint SPR
can i use a tac láser with no glint ?
This is why I deleted the game. People don’t stop playing they’ll keep being lazy af. Activision the new EA
why make a video about this... games full of campers now with variable zoom
So what scopes on the spr have no glint
Do the Merc Thermal optics have a glint?
Bro I always used that variable zoom scope  Haha that’s why I rekt those noobs
Lol raven and treyarch ruined this game had to stop playing for now
Im taking a break playing WZ rn, the game is so broken atm.
Wondered why I was having fun last week popping with a Variable AN-94/Amax/AMr
This game is fun but so frustrating. Every time they update something a new bug appears
I only see glints when i’m not Ads’ing
Vulture Custom Zoom and the 20X have glint, didn’t noticed until yesterday; and now MW snipers with variable zoom have no glint. What are they doing to this game ?
Next update roze skins are now available in the item shop and campers will get paid for every 20 seconds of camping with lmg’s
What’s a glint? And are the various MW guns different in the multiplayer?
Tf is a glint?
the amount of bugs in this game is just ridiculous. And most of them don't make any sense. Why would they even touch the glint, it was perfectly fine. I'm not sure if I'll continue to play the game because it's no fun in this state anymore. I hope the next Battlefield will be good.
Its just a gut feeling but I think the kar and hdr is gonna be next meta
"Which is cool or whatever" 😂
So this is how I lost a game and didn’t see where I was getting sniped from..
178 haters disliked smh
Lol everyone cool with the insane quick scope of this but complain about burst ars smh
we all know about that men lol. just for the content
Activision 🤡
raven gonna try to sue jgod or give him some hush money at this point lol
Next Vid: *THE FFAR NOW SHOOTS RPG MISSILES AND HAS ZERO RECOIL...!*
Meanwhile, Cold War snipers not having scope glint since launch...
Is anyone elses warzone very laggy but only on verdansk?
It really seems like they’re purposefully sabotaging the most successful game they’ve had in years.
Why do all my variable scopes on all snipers and marksman rifles have a glint?
COD Community:  No glint snipers! Can you get rid of that it’s broken!?  Raven:  Proceeds to fix no glint snipers but aCcIDeNtLy puts infinite stim back in.
The answer is used Variable Zoom Scopes to not show Glint
Wow no Glint on the Kar? I might actually reinstall war zone now
Oh god please no haha
New to Warzone lol I definitely appreciate anyone that checks out my Channel !!
You know what else they broke? My game.
Next video: AK47 meta weapon. No damage drop off, Hit Scan, Fastest TTK, ZERO RECOIL 😱
Infinity ward might have to fix this, ravens never touched a mw gun have they?
War zone is getting out of hand . Everybody using the same guns. What’s the point of having all those guns if u can only use one . Stupid....
Did they fix it in today's update?
And here i thought i was crazy when i noticed a high zoom scope killing me with no glint from time to time. Just thought it was a glitch in those particular matches
The effort you put into testing this game is insane. What would you do if they actually fixed everything and the game just worked.. I'm starting to think that the Raven "bug team" are actually content creators and they are keeping themselves in business with all these broken patches.
Broken broken broken,  kar98 will get nerfed...
Buff the Rytec!!!!!!!
If you are zoomed in with the variable is there glint ?
Has anyone suggested doing private lobbies to test things like this a little easier for you? Love the videos man, keep it up!
Yo! Isn't the "glint-effect" stronger the further away you are? Might be to the point of being non existent if you're too close, to avoid it being a flashlight blinding effect in close range. I also think it's a quite narrow cone where the glint is showing so the clips where you don't look directly at the enemy might have a glint that he just couldn't see, please correct me if I'm mistaken!
Which optic on the spr doesn’t give you glint?
Maybe instead of showing everyone the glitch and using it urself, you should tell the gaming company off and to not encourage this, and if you tell me your not your sadly mistaken. You and practically all other youtubers show this and they say it to be aware of it when in actuality your encouraging the use of the glitch for the time until it gets removed so don't show it. (That goes for all youtubers not just you)
oh god. Annddd this video is trending :)
TL;DW: Use Variable Zoom optics, they don't have a glint atm. It's the same for any gun (even Rytec) but it adds ADS.
We ready for the rise of stim glitch 5.0? Or 6.0 idk I lost count
Fixed?
ColdWar is ruined bro that trash game ruined this game
Raven are always breaking the game in some way or another, for every fix they do, 5 things get broken, I still remember when they broke hitmarkers, and now they have broken sleight of hand and some other gun perks, and also the glint for snipers
Now I really know what to use now 🥴🥴
New update: Hacker is buffed!
Didn't you say yourself that the glint is for scopes above 4xZoom. I don't know if you tested for the two different zooms but one of them got the zoom of 3.5 which is lower than 4.
I was using kar98 with variable zoom last night and i can still see the glint
These bugs are planned to give youtubers like him content throughout the season. If yal cant see that at this point I dont know what to say lol
Legend
From how far do you see the tac laser?
Raven should hire JGOD to test their game before each update.
The update also broke mw maps on console we can’t play certain maps it just kicks us out of the game
I’ve always used the Rytec with Variable zoom/explosive rounds 😂 I had no clue people couldn’t see my glint.
Why🤦🏾‍♂️
Just makes me literally not want to play until it’s fixed, and they ruin something less game breaking, may as well call it sniperzone for the next to weeks  This has really upset me
Should I replace presence of mind?
This game has got so bad that they are releasing new bugs and glitches just to keep people talking about it.
This is true dedication.
Nothing new here. Cold War scopes almost have never had a glint. Starting when they integrated them into WZ. Variable scope has NEVER had glint. I appreciate the exposure but it’s been broken for a long time.
At this point, these bugs and mess ups are some deluded way of attempting to throw challenges into the game.
Wow, just wow that's crazy broken.
To be honest I have no idea how this happen. How broken this game must be that MW guns are bugged.
So awesome 👍 I noticed using the aug yesterday I was 3-4 bursting people at 59metres and didn't down them. Everyone using M16 now. I'll stick with Kar98 and SPR 👍🤪
RIP to your KD....we thank you for your service
does solzero have a glint on spr atm? i really dont like the variable..
Is there a chance that the glint shows up only at certain distances depending on its zoom power?
Hasn’t the 3x VLK acog never had glint??
Jgod, TGD, Ace, Immortal, Drift0r. You guys are basically Activisions R&D dept.
Cold war snipers have been broken for months, and Raven does nothing about it. Then MW snipers are broken for a couple of days and they have put up on their site that they are working on it. The company is a joke, but people keep spending so much money on the game anyway.
yup, had at least 2 instances where I noticed this yesterday with some friends. sux
Idk why ppl hate the rytec   Its a weapon that requires skill to use (im talking without explosive)
Ahh yes. Another breaking update. But SBMM is alive and well
Its curios that jgod needs bad game developers to eat. So sad
This was really informative
lw3  1*10 optic glint now !!  cw sr changed
I actually never played a game with more flaws then warzone. Only reason this game is still alive is "Call of duty" in there name. It seems like people that play CoD do accept everything in a game and would never try anything else anyway so why do they need to give us good patches. Player base will play anyway.
Activision/Raven should be very happy that this game have no real competition. This game has so many flaws that I don't even play it even more, it's just a comedy.
Let’s be real they don’t care about warzone bugs, hackers and broken Cold War guns. They want you to buy Cold War.
Please work together with Activison an show them all the mistakes in the game..
What’s glint ?
Okay I'm convinced jgod and truegamedata honestly..for real work for them..they tell them how to change the game and keep it interesting..and keeping cod warzone  getting played .and our clicks..getting them paid. 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
alright no warzone for 2 weeks lmao
The irony is interesting. Raven did a great job for the Cold War Campaign but the way they are currently handling WarZone is just depressing. It's the same way 3arc is mishandling their mp. (Adding fixes while introducing new issues) _its just perfectly balanced_
Raven Devs: "What can we break this week for JGOD"
I don’t get why they are interfering with a game they didn’t develop?!?!? They were supposed to be fixing Cold War
Maybe it is just a Killcam Bug? The Heartbeat is also bugged there. Even if you have ghost, it will show you on the enemies heartbeat.
I have used the Cronen Scope for my HDR for MP and Warzone since day one. Never fails
the fact that you went through all of this just to test weapons is an amazing thing, my guy
I thought that people were hacking 😂
cold war just messed up a modern warfare
This shows again they only care about money
Aug nerfed 3 Times but still played by everyone u couldn't Say it better to show how good they nerf those CW guns
Good.  Long range AR's shouldn't compete with snipers over 80m.
I use the Kar98 as my go-to loadout, so you get a like within the first 50 seconds buddy! Cheers for your work!
Make a Pellington load out with max bullet velocity. Trust me on this one
I think the glint should only be visible is you are outside and facing the sun, you know like in real life. It makes no sense for me to be in building under the shade and the opponent can see the glint on my scope...
It actually baffles me that yall don't know Raven has always been the lead developer for Warzone. If IW was in charge the whole game you would have x999 the amount of doors and way worse glitches.
You know what during these times using the Rytec explosive without glint will be really funny 😂
This is how many times he said glint 👇
Raven is just useless, they made the game almost unplayable, and whats worst on ps4 if you bought a cd it actually deinstalled your multiplayer and campaign. I bought a game for 60 € just for those idiots to deinstall it for a free to play mod? What idiot decided that that was a smart option???
Finally something for Cold War fan bois to complain about. Long overdue. Just level them up in plunder guys! Isn't that what you said?
@JGOD.... you sure there's never been glint on MW snipers prior to this? I've been rocking the HDR with the cronen optic (pretty sure thats the name) the 3.25x one? And haven't seen any glint in any killcams when I die, and also hearing death comms of people saying they had no clue where I was. Been using it for like 3 months.
I think they just need someone who knows to program. Not just "people with ideas"....
Please check my videos my Warzone plays
not only did they not do anything to change FFAR or AUG or M16 significantly, but also somehow managed to break something completely unrelated
The MW optics are the ones that are wrong, the "3x" optics are 2x, the "12x" is like "6x". Also are you sure about no glint? Killcams are notoriously dodgy, I'm not convinced
Hey JGOD, would be happy to help you test weapons in the upcoming future.  Your work has helped me so much in the past and I don't miss out any of your videos you post. Continue your excellent donation to the COD community!!
WOAHH JGOD!! ALMSOT HALF A MILLION VIEWS AND #32 ON TRENDING!!!!!
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

Amen
Sleight of hand does work
No wonder I was getting snipped so much out of nowhere, it’s almost like their ruining the game on purpose
Thanks jgod for ruining the game even more now everyone is using it and it’s annoying
It’s like they don’t want us  Playing
WEIRD!!
Does variable thermal have glint?
jgod should make an onlyfans and upload videos so treyarch, raven and cod in general cant find this out and patch it.
I came across this a few times, between the ffar, M16 and this in warzone ive just been grinding out some camos in multi until they sort their game out. Poor form. It’s just a what next situation
Oh!!! I just thought  I was in a potato lobby
lets all abuse this  and exploit it as much as we can
Does anyone know if they fixed the finn lmg barrles
Do the cold war weapon have glint?
The Vulture custom zoom now has a glint since the update
I was wondering why no one was shooting me when I was ADS for a long time with HDR variable zoom.
hey JGOD, why  are you testing snipers after the aug and ffar got nerfed for the 2nd time?? we want a new class setup for both after the 2nd nerf!
the guns he was killed with in testing can be counted on one hand amax ffar aug and m16
JGOD Talk
Jgod Talk
Jgod Talks
Man JGOD DESERVES RESPECT
This is what happens when you layoff your staff to pay your executives and then hire from Fiverr!
People need to stop spending money on this game.  its broken and they refuse to fix it properly.  The developers dont care about the community, just the sales in the store.
I really don't mind no glint snipers tbh. I think it's dumb to have glint to begin with... just have a high muzzle flash
Next Update: Crossbow is hitscan, fully automatic and has 20 rounds
Jgod will go dowm as the mf who knows it all....stories will be told in future of the one and only JGOD
At this rate, I'd imagine a gitch that makes the Kar98 burst the whole 5 bullets it's coming soon
Luckily im always using variable scopes 😊😊😊
We need a new game period
Yea it broke it I can't even play warzone. It freezes and then crashes my system right away. I'm playing on xbox one s all digital.
so this is why...
J god can u make a video on testing the grip attachments especially on the ffar, especially after it got an ads nerf.
Sleight of hand isn't working plus a lot of attachments are not working when equipped. Anyone else having these issues?
Does presence of mind still last a minute???
I’ve been doing this for months
If it's not broken Break it Wait that's not right
No please...
So glad i never purchased cw they don't deserve my money
Great. ..... Ive been labeled "super annoying" lol
Broke? If there's no glint then I'd call it an improvement. That's what I liked about pubg, you had to rely on sound & skill. Granted WZs sound isn't pubg sound so it makes it rougher but you have the kindergarten friendly hit markers, so not a big deal.
Does anyone know what pc system monitoring overlay he is using?
JGod needs a job for a big cod company to break down their game hes so good at it
THEY REALLY MESSED UP GAME DIGITAL VERSION WONT DOWNLOAD AND DISK HAS COPYING DATA LOOP ISSUE
should of done from sameish distance
Ffar nerfed, Aug nerfed.. Me: "I wonder what madness is around the corner."  Raven: No glint Kar98s for everyone!
It’s funny because snipers having glits is actually a new thing games have been doing. If you go back not even a generation later but a few games no snipers have glits. Glit was only added as a complaint because newbies couldn’t play with the big boys
You said glint so many times it lost all meaning in my head
Why does the cod community keep giving them money lmao everything is always broken or op
BF6 coming but do not, I repeat do not preorder .  James Bond BR coming too.
Nooo now everyone is going to abuse this thank tou jgod lol 🤣
Another bug is the FINN LMG bugs, your arm takes up the whole screen when you use the chainsaw grip and the adverse barrels do not increase the rate of fire
He alway shotks
Wonder how long it will take them to fix this....
Glint is a joke anyway even on a high magnification scope. If you’re in a window with the sun behind you, there shouldn’t be a glint. It’s 2021 not 2010 games should have moved on by now
Starting to wonder if these devs are actually devs...
Let's go he's in trending
It’s so weird to see JGOD get slightly more and more frustrated with every “update” and “fix” that is being implemented. If you can get this man annoyed, you are really doing something wrong
I love having the extra Cold War weapons but nothing was this broken until they tried to add them to WZ lol. Thanks JGod, FFAR / Kar98 loady just got better. lol
They make it so hard to enjoy this game.
Ayyyye he heard my comment
It sucks because, as a programmer with nearly 15 years experience, I've dealt with my fair share of "changing this thing shouldn't affect this other thing at all, but it does" scenarios, so it's a shame that it's biting them so hard.  I can imagine how frustrated the devs are on the other side, while probably also being told by a product/project manager that these things are "not a priority".
How has CoD not offered this guy a job...
Jgod is low-key sus and camp 😂😂😂
Slight of hand is also broken on kar98 💀
Even more of a reason to use High Alert perk
If u buy a blueprint and you dont have the gun unlocked will it unlock if u buy blueprint
You should try to look into a video about lethals and damage! Like Molotov compared to a Thermite grenade. Would be interesting to see.
I was warning up on plunder before all this and I knew there was someone snipping me from  the hills behind storage and I was like wtf🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ but now I know thanks again man🤘❤️
Activision does not care to check what they modify on the game, as jgod will check it for them, so they just adjust the broken stuff in the next update. You should get payed by activision man!
So many little rats running this now I wondered why everyone was sniping RavenSoftware are tw@s
messing up the game as they go lmaoo
I wonder if warzone would be in the state it's in right now if infinity ward kept maintaining it instead of raven
Did you mention the no slight of hand bug and the finn barrels not increasing fire rate?
Already noticed that it is broken now and for a while. Jgod, why had you to make it public... now everybody is running with no glint snipers through the zone. :-/
Well no wonder I was getting a more ragey rage when I was someone guys.
They probably broke the Mac 10 unlock challenge as well because it doesn’t count any of ur progress
Also been finding when I hope in vehicles they are bugging out and not accelerating.
Oh my god, this is sabotage, they are doing this on purpose, can't think of another reason
Wow that’s why I been getting picked off my past couple games earlier running out in the open
Lol so kar 98 is still meta weapon. Has to be the most consistently GREAT weapon throughout the seasons lol
Warzone is full of hackers man! That game is ruin
Who cares about glint? Mw2 and Cod4 didn’t have glint. This game is trash compared to those.
I have downloaded the 1.34 update and was able to play fine for a day or 2 and then had to download it again. Played again fine and today turned PS4 on and it is making me download it again. Something that I’m doing or something with the game?
I like Jgods videos before he even starts talking 😎👍
LOL I was wondering why my SA87 with sleight of hand suddenly started taking longer to reload that I took it off. Thanks for the explanation mr JGOD :)
This was not an accident
Brooooooo i though i was tripin cause i kept getting killed by a guy witha kar and i see his body but not glint
Put on the bullseye reticle on the 3x optic it makes the game run at 20 FPS when it’s in your hand
Jgod do you know why summ maps don’t work for Xbox ???
A list would be very nice at the end of vod
I feel like they should just remove glint for consistency, leave the laser appearance though
Kar 98, the one gun that in no way needs a buff or a nerf - gets a huge buff as nothing to stop campers now if the glint can't be seen! 😂
With the variable zoom scope, does it seem to make a difference with what zoom setting you have chosen or no?
Sleight of hand is also broken :/ Stupid game
Ok. Now i understand a lot of things about today's matches on Wz....
In JGOD we trust
they just buffed @its_iron
Dear JGOD, I think You should’n upload videos like this because you are giving people ideas. Lot of us wouldn’t even know or wouldn’t even notice these things, but after watching the video the majority of the players will try to profit from these bugs and use them for their advantage. Love you man! You are the COD President!
Um gnna go ham till it get fixed err maybe nvr😛. Thnx
good info as always. Thank you JGOD.
Weel, IRL modern warfare now we have honeycomb like anti-reflective devices that get rid of the optics reflection.Perhaps they try to simulate this in the game 😊
Man this small indie dev just can't seem to get it together.
The glint shouldn't be there until You've been hard scoped in for a set amount of seconds or a random number of seconds to simulate the sun moving in and out of cloud cover
Honestly id rather get rytec'ed from half way across the map than aug beamed from everywhere
I don’t understand how people enjoy this game after all the recent detrimental changes.  It has literally made 90% of all MW weapons irrelevant and you can almost guarantee they will patch them all out at some point.  A once Amazing game that is now trash.
I hate glint. Not realistic lol
DID THEY FIX THE ADD-ON DOWNLOAD ???
keep up the good work
Kar 98 feels nerfed
Poor regression testing by Raven. Did not have these issues with Infinity Ward.
great day to you as well
I thought glint shows when the player is a certain distances away? If you’re in range there won’t be glint.
Curious if there's any variation with distance from the target?  Some of these you're pretty close to the opponent and if it were to show scopes at a certain distance, you might not see one in may of these scenarios.
that explains why my squad got wiped with a whole squad with HDR no glint
@jgod not sure if you tested this and i missed it but is it possible that the glint appears when you use the higher zoom on the optic?
Is it just variable zoom scopes I love the spr 28mm scope does that have a glint does anybody know?
I thought at close range snipers never had glint? Am I the only one who knows this?
this man deserves all the success
this game is an absolute joke. Raven is a bunch of incompetent children.
It's all David Vonderhaar's fault
You can't complain the guns aren't balanced now.....
JGOD I love you bro I literally look forward to ur content often and it makes me feel better I have anxiety so truly bro ty for everything u do u help more then just me in that way take care goat
sweet went and try the variable on kar98 and after couple games i got shadowban 350ms lobby searching...do not recomend to try them xd
Does the Susat multizoom still have a glint?
We are all beta testers....LOL
Petition to change your name to JDOG
Rytech has no suppressors though  right?
The saw lmg has a hand bug. All I see is my arms when playing with it
JGOD the GOD
Wow
they should hire JGOD as community manager
We don't deserve this guy he's too good to us
Hey man yourmomslover88 from xbox here have you seen the hilarious 680 shotgun glitch it literally breaks your arm behind your back or looks like you are pointing at someones face
So now they just buff snipers instead of an AUG nerf, ok..... thanks??
Why everytime i start my ps4 and try to load warzone it has to do the 1.34 update everytime which takes an hour?
The devs are having kids play with the game balancing.
Nukes going off in warzone...... followed by  message to seek shelter
what about the fact that sometimes the killcam doesn't show what's really happening? maybe in game the other player does see it?
Devs: *inserts yakety sax song* Yep nothing wrong here!
JGOD will have endless content thanks to these morons 😂👍
Incompetence to the Nth degree.
it feels like every update breaks something
How do you get that fps counter on the top left of your screen?
I know I wasn't going crazy yesterday.... i made a Sleight of Hand MP5 just to use it again since i rarely used it because I stay away from meta guns, and the gun was reloading at normal speed not with the perk equipped... I only use MW guns since I don't like the CW guns (Except the Bullfrog) and now they are fing up the MW guns which should not be touched.  I don't know how can they even achieve that
Raven is seriously mishandling Activision biggest money maker... does Activision not care? It makes zero sense...
F up after F up!!!!
Is it confirmed focus perk not working anymore? I used on my Kar last night and seemed to be working. Then again flinch might be minimal on it to begin with or maybe I'm used to it. I don't wanna use a wasted attachment/perk.
This is not good news lol
This game is so broken
The Rytec meta has come
I'm done with this game for a minute, this is getting so obnoxious with all the broken stuff and foresight and Warzone is just not in a fun place right now with the cheaters on top of everything.  This sucks, I loved MW2019.
Jgod u are a god. How u have the patience
I know it's not a super viable Warzone weapon, but the FiNN's adverse barrels (aka the ones that are supposed to increase the rate of fire) aren't working properly. They don't actually increase the rate of fire for some reason.
JGOD could you please mention the fact that people are getting unfairly banned due to a bug on CW zombies and Activision refuses to acknowledge it or help, they even censoring zombies reddit
You know Cod hates this man for always calling them out on their bs 😂😂
What is the difference between the two zoom levels with a variable zoom? Glint at full zoom and no glint when backed out?
Thanks now everyone is going too be using this now 🤦‍♂️ why?
This is why Warzone needs to be completely separate from modern warfare. Literally can't use sleight of hand and now this...
You'd think that after being out for over a year they could at least learn how to not further break things in their game
How could they mess up the MW weapons too? ;(  They should just go back to the pre-Season 1 version of Warzone and start developing the Integration from scratch...
Yay now the ppl who sit on top of mountains with thermal hdrs won’t have glint YAY
what secondary is the best to run with kar 98???
I mean its not suppose to take place in like the 1960s so none of the scopes should have glint
Why do you release videos like u just want lil rats to be even more annoying
2:29 i killed jgod
Ugh raven software literally has never managed a big game before why would infinity ward hand off warzone to a noob developer like they see whats happening dont they? Raven is killing this game, they don't know how to balance guns, don't know how to fix bugs, don't know how to do anything, why can't infinity ward kick them off charge if you notice warzone was in a much better place before they handed it off to raven
Alright, I'm calling it, we're absolutely not getting an anti-cheat, or at least not one that works if they can't even get glint right in this game.
Well the whole game is broken because I can't play warzone it's 6 days now it's copying addon
It's A FIX! ... Think!...
???Reverse Boost???
I thought the glint had to do with how far away they are from you or you from them....seems like the further away the more apt to have a glint. But I am just a car audio installer that plays games at night to forget about the day. Haha.
Finally something broken that will help in my favor.
I agree, the CW 4X should have glint
Imagine killing JGOD then realizing he was just testing for a video
The god has given his testament
variable has no glint when it zooms at 3.5x (that's normal) but what about 8x ??
So Kar98 with Variable Zoom scope tonight.. say less lol
Seriously what the f**k is wrong with Raven.
Did you test with variable zoom low and high zoom. Maybe high zoom has glint low zoom doesn’t
Raven acts like when patrick made another giant paint bubble
finally something is working towards mw players favour :D
In my eyes, they just balanced MW snipers to compete with CW snipers 🤷🏻‍♂️
Warzone needs a quality of life up update badly before any content, this happens alot to live service games I feel, the constant adding of content either breaking the game with glitches or balancing issues and the games becomes to frustrating to play. Issues that take weeks or months to fix to then have another update break something else, HOW DO I REACH THESE KIDS!
This game is so broken 😆
God has spoken.
Also I noticed yesterday that sleight of hand isnt working on my Modern warfare MP5
Love the way he roast the killcam players
Me who been using variable zoom since ever: 👀👀👀👀👀
Does this work only for the hdr/kar? Or does it work also for the spr?
They get paid too much money to play checkers, this is chess, they're slowly controlling the meta. Everyone's feedback is keeping it fresh to a degree without alot of new content. Like dope that is never as good as the first hit, we just wait for it.
WarZone is slowly killing itself. One good BR away from dying.
Yea happened to me today, guy in firetower watched him, went to challenge him and boom headshot snipe kar98 no glint.... was really confused..
I’m at the point of just unsubscribing from all warzone content creators so that I can just forget about this trash game.
At this point I feel like raven wants warzone to fail
Imagine after they patch this they accidentally bring back the one shot Famas shotgun barrel
I’m so over this game. Haven’t played in a week, and looks like I’m gonna coming back. Even if they fix the aug everyone’s using the m16 now. Even then, it feels like there’s always something broken with the game.
Wait is there glint that close anyways?
I don’t think the the 2x 3x 4x scopes and any thing less than those should have glint but the 4.4x and above from 6,8,10,12.5, or 20x and variable zoom should al have glint always
Time to apologize to my buddy for when I went off on him for not seeing a glint that was extremely visible in the death cam
They messed up the FIN lmg barrels which should increase the firerate.  Don't know why..
So, are you saying I don't need to run with a Tundra and Kross for no glint anymore?  I can go back to my kar with a variable? Awesome.  ALSO -- JGOD, is it possible that they made it more realistic depending on where you're aiming if the Sun is hitting it or not?  Great video BTW --- per usual.
Lmao
So when will Activision or Raven hire you? Seems like they need it!
Sleight of hand on mw mp5 does not work and sometimes i have sleight of hand on mp7 but i didnt equiped it its so buggy and i know very well sleight of hand
okay now they're just trolling us
The variable scope on the kar has no glint?! I use that one the whole time and I think there is glint
I'm so glad I've stopped playing this game. How can a developer continue to ruin a game with so much potential.
I know this is off topic but I just wanted to raise an issue. There are so many people, like me, who have had their activision accounts hacked. This issue is only this big because it’s activision. No other game has this problem. Many people like me have tried contacting them to fix it but no reply or resolution has been made. I’ve lost account. It had many camos, lots of time played and so much more lost. I’ve spent money. I’ve lost it all. All I ask is that we as a community raise awareness towards this problem. As a multi billionaire company they should be doing better. Ty for reading this.
Good job JGod. These types of error annoy me. It is easy to solve. If using a scope with glint. person A is viewing person B, within a range (angle), show the glint. Else Don't.
Did you check it once it was zoomed in at the full 8x zoom.
Thx Jgod
now everyone is going to decide to run a scope with no glint lol thanks man
Can these guys do anything right? Seems like they fix one problem and cause 10 more!!!!
I went back into Battlefield 5 Firestorm. Honestly I miss it. Looks so nice and the destruction was a very nice addition.
Since the cw intergration this game has gone downhill. Pretty pathetic.
pretty sure because its modern warfare weapon it will be patched in 2 hours, but if it was a cold war glitch, it would not be fixed ever or in the first 3 days
what about if you zoomed in with the variable unzoomed is lower than 4 right?
I thought something was up yesterday when I was playing. Guess I was right, typical Raven
Good.  Glint is stupid.
Get these raven clowns off warzone give it back to the year one team.
I knew it was bugged
This game is trash 🗑
I've been using the variable zoom scope on my HDR since I first unlocked it way back in season 1. Are you saying they removed the glint just recently?
wait.... the perks don't work? Like Presence of Mind or Sleight of hands? ...
I'm the only one that likes the rytek
Yo shut up class I’m trying to listen to the COD TEACHER.
Jgod I hate you for this 🤦🏿‍♂️, now every lobby is going to be full with these snipers
He sacrifices his K/D for us. Bless this man.
This is getting out a hand man
JGOD I have not been playing the game much but I do continue to watch your vids. DUDE! I gotta say that I'm super duper proud of you man. You've come a very long way. Wishing you more success. You deserve it. Hope your kid is doing well too. God Bless You both🙏
Raven   is on a mission here, now they destroy Infinity Ward weapons balancing.
To add to this, the barrels for the Finn LMG are broken as well.  The adverse versions do not change the fire rate at all.  Because those are broken, have to wonder how many more are broken as well.
I seen zoom on a variable hdr earlier today? Are u sure when the scope is toggled to high zoom there is also no glint, there might only be no glint on the low zoom mode and the 12.6x mode has glint?
Use the Cronen 4x scope on the kar 98
I noticed this cuz I was using old Dusty blueprint and when enemy was killing me
What is this operator skin JGOD using at 4:54 ??
This game never fails to make itself worse 🙌
This is starting to remind me of the 5.2 TTK downfall that BFV went through. WZ is slowly dying w all these changes.
I noticed my sleight of hand is not working in multiplayer
If they ain’t fixing CW snipers I’m really happy for this... if it’s going to be broken, atleast make it fair
Please stop supporting this awful game. They dont deserve our time and money anymore
i swear any update make the game even worse, next video, aug nerf: +500 dmg and recoil decreased by 99%
JGOD u gotta talk about heartbeat sensoe detection while having ghost perk still being seen on radar
I’ve been using no glint for ever, since bf3. Cronin for kar98, y’all welcome.
They want their own game to fail for some odd reason
Done with cod until its fixed
Great. Just another reason for me to hold off and not play WZ. Im getting kinda bored with the old bo3 engine in CW
My dad works for Raven. I was blind on one eye so he poked out my other one to help me.
The new electric bullfrog (power coil) dont work cant get it to show up only  gives me fists
Us: Can You Fix The Weapons Please?  Raven: Sure Here Can You Buy Our Operator/Blueprint Bundles.
If anyone is still using their hard earned money towards this game, please stop lol
Jgod is cracked bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥 keep up the good work much love from Cali
The dude with the ASVAL, was TERRIBLE!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is the first time I won't agree with JGod regarding COD. Westie posted a KAR98 video a few weeks back showing him using the Cronen scope. Since then, I've seen many folks using that scope , and as I watched the killcam, there was no glint on these scopes. So this wasn't new with the 1.34 update.
"messing up war zone as they go" That's been the narrative for the past year now lol
Only person I've ever seen who'll sacrifice  his K/D for statistics
Like the snipers aren’t broken in MW now let’s them not glint when aiming at someone yes that’s the fix ...
how do they manage to mess up the mw weapons? the cw ones are already broken
Why every month we got a new bug?
poggers
Are you sure it doesn’t just disappear at short distances ?
Everything seemed fine until CW, they should just remove CW until everything is fixed
Glints should be realistic in real life you see glints when the scope is in the same direction as the sun. It’s dumb having glints in dark areas etc not realistic at all
Broken broken it is a broken game. It is broken, totally! But hey, still playing this season! However, it might be my last season, because I am done with this mess.
At this point raven should hand over warzon back to iw
Can we just revert the game back to before the CW integration?
So variable zoom does not have a glint?
Does the glint appear if they zoom in further when using the variable zoom?
As if the snipers were weak in this stupid game😂
Haha obviously
Does this work with the spr cause that’s the scope I use.
I just wish they kept investing on MW Multi-player. CW just broke the whole atmosphere. Why sell a downgrade of MW??
WHAT
We all appreciate your videos, thank you!!
Watching Raven slowly destroy the game is like watching your child slowly die in a hospital bed
Lol wtf is a glint?
Why can’t the glint be dependant in light? You wouldn’t get a glint in a building but could outside. Would be more realistic.
Knowing Raven, they won't fix this for another 2-3 months.
Thank you for taking the time to explore, test, and create this.  Now i got some class editing to do.
They broke maps for special opps and stuff
Glad to see I wasn’t crazy
No flint, On JGOD
Im french. What is a "glint" please?
Unrelated, but anyone on Xbox not able to play some of the MW multiplayer maps?
Did you test if the variable scope has glint if you use the higher zoom on it, like low zoom has no glint and high zoom has glint?
Seems that the PS4 WarZone players had 52GB of bugs 😂
Now when I play search and destroy, snipers will one tap me before I get a chance to challenge
👍👍👌
So does the susat 4x scope glint or not ??
Could the laser possibly be blocking the glint? After a certain distance the laser disappears
I just got obsidian for my rytec, whilst using the focus perk for the past two weeks. It definitely had little to no effect. I tried multiple optics and builds, still felt like flinch was too much to handle
How does this happen!?
They have to be doing this on purpose at this point
Yo instead of making no glint for MW to make up for messing up the CW guns...why not give the snipers glint like they should
Ive been using no glint for a long time! I still do! HDR 3.25 ZOOM NIGHT VISION! I HAVE HAD OVER 400M KILLS!
I feel like since Cold War has dropped it's been nothing but cold war meta even as bad as you have two cold war-ar meta
Is the 6th sense/high alert perk still working? Because I've been sniped a few times but not had the alert but when aimed with ARs it works
Awesome,  can’t wait for this to be fixed in 6-8months.
Cant even find any lobby with out any kind of cheater fml
3:14 is so hilarious
By the time I’m done grinding for the variable zoom they’ll have already fixed it 😂
Garbage
04:25 mentioned Kar98 w/variable zoom shows glint. I am confused.
Can’t wait to get dropped by kar98’s even more now
Of course. Of course they did.
awh sheeit
Ill stick to my cronen sight like the faster reloading
Snipers were used a lot more in warzone before CW. I don’t think they are in a rush to fix this because maybe it brings in more snipers to lobbies
This man is tanking his K/D to get us the content we need. What a chad.
Jgod do you ever check ur findings on the Activision website if their aware ,looking into ,fixing etc
Such a amateur company
They’re actually just trolling at this point
Id love to be in the board meetings what exactly is discussed money money or how can we fk up a game today
Man... You should be on the payroll of these places for the amount of work you put in.
Is it possible that results found in plunder would vary from results in actual BR modes? Similar to there being stat differences in custom lobbies vs. normal BR lobbies. I think TGD showed that a while back.
This is a travesty  Proceeds to immediately equip variable zoom  scope to try and get easy kills
Svaka čast JBože :D
I think we can all agree that since Raven has taken over the game has been basically in shambles
early
my daily WZ lecture
Could it be that the no glint effect is in the low zoom configuration of the optic as it has a 3.5x magnification?
1000 comment
Im baffled by how bad this Raven team is... I wonder what they're doing on a day to day basis besides brainstorming reactive bundles for people to buy from the store.
I always use variable zoom on MW snipers so this is gonna be fun til they fix it.
I know this might sound dumb, but does it still have no glint when you zoom in with variable scope, since when zoomed out I think it’s less than 4x but when zoomed in its like 8x
Well no glint is good . But when when light hits it then to to glint . But there should not be any when in shade or darker local .
You should have kept this a secret. Now they are going to fix issue. :)
Let me tell you a joke                Warzone
Dagummit.  If it ain't one thing its 5 others. This game is always having issues.
i thought it was just me
There are people out there running classes that aren’t JGOD approved classes. Smh
U think with how popular warzone is they hire some ppl at least competent to know snipers have glints and it’s the scopes not just the guns. lol still can’t believe when they had the iron sight snipers glinting haha
Bro, why don't you post patch notes updates anymore? We miss it :(
Is the Cold War 20x scope still no-glint?
‌
idk variable zoom is all I use and when I miss a shot they always seem to notice my glare or glint
It was the worst decision to take Raven Software on board.  Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Next Video: They have added glint to all optics
Which would you recommend, Tundra or HDR?
Fmj only works in half, it does go through walls but the damage against vehicles doesn't
I think the wounding perk does not work... I think true game data tested it i can't remember for sure who it was... maybe I am wrong
Why expose my meta 😂😂
No better feeling than opening up YouTube and seeing JGOD right away
What if you zoom in with the variable zoom does the glint turn on? That’s the answers we need
The game sucks like Cold War both broken
TIN FOIL TIME: Activision is ruining warzone because they want to go back to yearly releases and hate the idea of supporting a single game for years on end.
I have been using HDR for 6 Months. I do think it is pretty Powerful and has a nice range.
no cap I was testing it out wif my squad earlier on. there's literally no glint :) only the tac showing
I really was wondering last night. I was so confused. My opponent was prob wondering why i was staring right at him for so long not even aiming back O_O
The amount of research effort you put into these videos, even though Warzone is just a game. I can certify that at this point with so many videos, you are basically doing service to humanity in general.
Hdr is nerf?
This is done on purpose. Theres only so many “mistakes” one can make before you start lifting an eyebrow.
Imo glint should only happen with optics when the sun is facing ya
They fix one thing and break 5 others. IW and Treyarch should work on this game since they have more experience than raven
Well I was waiting for the CW glints to get fixed before moving back to the HDR,  this works to.
The actual state of this game
One step forward and about a mile backwards.. Welcome to Warzone ladies and gentleman
JGOD, presence of mind doesn’t extend holding breath for a minute anymore. Seems like maybe 10-15 seconds
lol no wonder since update i was using spr with variable zoom and for some reason people werent able to pinpont me. lol now i know why.
Do you even see glint that close range?  I thought you had to be a certain distance away to see glint.
Thanks for everything you do man
I dont know if it has happened to other but when I play MW multiplayer then one of the hands when using the model 680 shotgun is broken. It flops around and blocks my vision. I´d like that to get fixed.
If it ain't broke, it ain't Activision...
Well be using this with Kar lol
what kind of reverse cyberpunk is this?, game starting to broken day by day lol.
Does it matter how far zoomed the variable zoom scopes are? Those MW variable scopes toggle between two zoom levels; maybe the lower zoom level is below 4x and therefore doesn't show a glint?
It so surprising how the devs have never broken the in game store
Einfach peinlich...🤯
These poor plunder players thought they were killing bots, but it was really just JGOD using them as his test subjects
Wait if u add the tac laser to the kar does the glint shows ?
This is why you use the scout optic on your Kar 🤫
Yeah I noticed this the other day and I was really confused
They mess up the game on purpose
Activision/Raven/IW/whoever else...employ these YouTubers to tell you how to do your job properly. 😠
I pretty much always run the HDR variable so this is great, thanks for messing up again Raven!
So as long as it is a variable zoom, there is no GLINT? Bruh..
and this will cause hard scoping in multiplayer 🙂
All those players : I KILED JGOD! JGOD: your just a test, a statistic
JGOD, cold war 10× and 20x NOW have glint!
Devs need to get fired! This is a multi bilion dollar game🙄
I have the same shirt 🙌🏼
"They have now broken warzone you can now pack a punch your load out
Wtf this game is a broken mess
JGOD is really doing the Lord’s work out here, would love to see the stats on his test account though, all this testing has to hurt that KD
I always use the dual zoom on the kar98, I noticed lastnight whenever I sniped someone and only when I smiled someone they would spectate me I wonder if this was why.
im surprised warzone has lasted as long as it has considering how broken and messed up it is.
Lol this is getting ridiculous
why did Raven even touch the MW guns? I don't get it, they keep finding new ways to ruin this game. Activision give WZ back to infinty ward
Can u please make a vid on the 74u
No glint ? An issue ? You’re joking right ?  It’s modern warfare. Emphasis on Modern. Like snipers don’t put thin cloth around the scope of their rifle so there isn’t any glint. Ya know... like they do in actual warfare.
Are you sure I feel like I’m still being seen by everyone when I aim at them with variable HDR
yeah, this happened to me yesterday
Guarantee activision is watching JGod for all the broken things that need fixed
I was wondering why I was getting shot with explosives rounds yesterday even tho he was missing I didn’t know where I was getting shot from
The man puts in all this work and ppl watch it and copy exact classes could at least leave him a like!
They really need to have a test server and let people play it. Before they roll out updates and patches
Strike strike strike!!!!!! No more play for the bug game!
Can we just go back to the modern warfare days before cold war. I promise I won't complain anymore :(
Too much time on your hands bro
I dont understand. You get no glint using the kar 98 with the variable scope.
How is it possible to both like and dislike a video? :D
I’ve been using sleight of hand in multiplayer for a few days wondering why it’s not working 😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Man I feel bad for raven... they are only like 250 total in the company and thats ALL the man power that warzone is getting..   Thanks for this Jgod
Raven just employ this man to test before an update and literally nothing will ever be broken again
“This could cause a tone of issues” .... proceeds to make a video for hundreds of thousands to learn about and abuse. 😂 I support what you’re doing but this is a fowl 😂😬
Are these ‘no glint’ MW weapons new after the update? Because i know people who have always used variable zooms but pretty sure (almost 100% certain) they used to have glints.
I can not begin to understand how they can mess up this bad. They "fix" one thing and breaks 10 others.  Things that were working fine end up beeing broken as rhe fix something else.  At this point I ask myself if they are doing it on purpose, like putting rcxd below loadout.
Wtf guys. Like for real?!? Get a grip, Raven or Activision I don’t care. They’re killing the game
Aye guys I was wondering if y’all’s modern warfare ain’t working in y’all’s play station
you should figure out the update 1.34 bug that makes the game virtually unplayable by making players update a 72 gb update every time they close the game and reopen
They break everything , But why can't they break the RAAL lock v.v I want to play with the RAAL in Spec.
i will believe anything this man says
Raven is way over their heads. There hasn't been a sound, bug free update since prior to cold War.
Jgod finds another issue which everyone now uses. And warzone dies a little bit more.
Jgod can you do another M4A1 video?
Adding bug is part of commercial plan. U talk about them, we use this glitch, they fix one, they create an other, the ridiculous meta always for the most recent game, etc.
It's still 1st April on their calendar.
Why is it so hard to just update a game?
The CW integration has ruined warzone and they just keep digging the hole deeper. Raven is incompetent.
These mfs can't roll out an update without breaking 5 things in the process lmfao what a joke of a company
I think glint shows on some snipers for certain ranges
Just a broken game...and btw the 3.5 on hdr always had no glint
I can’t believe how broken this whole thing is. Uninstalling
Can we all applaud JGOD for his KDR sacrifice?
By now you should know, Raven breaks the game on purpose. so they can fix it, And seem like they're good at listening to us players.
Bruh, now the MW weapons will eventually have their attachments unreliable too 😩
Warzones been trash ever since cold war integrated with warzone. 😐😐
lmao I saw people using variable and thought it was just a choice instead of a tryhard abusive tactic
game feels like its getting worse every single patch... like SWtOR.. every patch they fix 1 thing and break 5 other
That’ll do Raven Software, That’ll do .
3:39: "They are still using the AUG, even though it has been nerfed 3 times, this tells you something, about how well it was nerfed"
Finally I’ve been tweeting him about it
I’m sure this is the same at both levels of zoom on the variable zoom? I didn’t catch you mentioning that if you did already
I see you reverse boosting  LOL!!
What’s a glint
As this point it’s on purpose don’t care what anybody says
so many bugs
You the man jgod! I check your channel everyday. Thanks for your info.
Activision made 3B last year on a game held together by duct tape. Shoot for the stars, anything is possible people! 😂
It could be that the glint just comes up when the sight is facing the sun ?
Imagine some of JGOD's viewers who don't often understand what he does all the time, kills him in plunder and be like, "YO I JUST KILLED JGOD, I'M A GOD NOW!" Just a thought.
I have the same shirt JGOD 😳
Pov: your equipping the variable zoom
Just cause you pansies keep getting sniped doesn't mean the 4x or any other scope that doesn't have glint should. There isn't a glint in real life lol
When it comes to Raven Software, "breaking" things is always done intentionally.
At this point the devs should be glad they're not Japanese. Because their work is so shameful even seppuku couldn't save them.
Raven keeps ruining this game
So there’s now no glint for the MW snipers? Great because I needed to be more afraid when I have to cross open areas 😂
Warzone QA is insulting
I wouldn't be surprised ifthey fix the glint bug on the MW weapons without fixing the CW glint issues. We've been so ignored as a community, we're just taking all the punches now.
it is terrible.. I hope warzone will die soon, they deserved this
Dude sent u the clips so u can post and have cod patch it..dudes a real bxtch and snitch
It’s a shame this game has devolved into a complete joke
I prefer not having glint. Glint ruins Ghillie Suits
Did he say focus does not work?
Sleight of hand is not working!!
Can you do a video on the best SMGs with the latest nerf?
shouldn't have showed me this lol. sniping in solos bout to be toxic
I think Cold War is the most garbage game in the entire call of duty games 😤
Yeah I was getting destroyed in Resurge by snipers you couldn't see. 100% there is an issue with this just now.
Not related buy i tried the m16 last night....its the real deal
these F'ing devs.
Glint is not there when you are so close.. Your testing is flawed. Test at 100m!
They're not broken, they're doing it on purpose
Raven has absolutely no clue what their doing. They can't balance guns properly and this game has become soooo stale
Why are you crying about mw snipers being broken cold war snipers have been broken since they came out
Had to like this video for the energy and effort he put in
I just want to know what you were saying in the hotmics lmao
They’re not to be messing with MW guns.
What is going on with this game man? Why is it always so broken
Weird , i use HDR with variable , i can see my glint on killcams .
M8 ur too close
What about the Finn lmg tho
Hey man🖐️🖐️🖐️ great to see u do all the research..... I think that the perks for the MW guns are not working as they should..... The MW smg, we usually add sleight of hand for quick reload.... But it doesn't quickly reload.... The gun reload as normally it does.... No quick animation..... So if u can look into that; it would be really appreciated 🙏🙏
When JGOD shows you a class set up , you put that class as your main
I have been using the kar with a merc scope since day one.  I know it used to have a glint.  Not sure if it does anymore?
I'm now 100% they're not doing this by accident anymore
That RAM-7/Kar98 or SPR loadout is lookin pretty tasty now
I’m about to have fun in search and destroy
When you're testing these things out which are specific to one class of attachment, why don't you _only_ use that class of attachment and remove all others? Remove all other variables. XclusiveAce does this too where he tests while using other attachments (like the green laser) that could alter the results.
It's almost as if it didn't is a good idea to have multiple game devs working on the game smh, goodwork JGOD!
2:08 and  2:20 you died exactly the same way as me. vs same weaphons. Same place
Imagine how many dudes walked away thinking JGod is a bot
I don't understand why Raven can't watch JGOD vids and fix all once and nice....
I slowly start to think they mess this game up on purpose, I mean wtf?
I think they just want you to use Cold War weapons 😤
ATP this game is pathetic 🚮😂🤣
Warzons: Is in a balanced state where all guns are somewhat viable. Raven software with their cold war integration: We don't do that 'round here😎
Raven could break an anvil.
If COD ever dries up, jgod is still sorted. Just retrain to be a science teacher. Your a natural, you just need to add a jgod  corduroy blazer jacket with patches on the elbows to your merch store.
Remove everything to do with cold war, the game was good before the integration
My MW constantly uninstalls it’s own multiplayer
All these broken weapons and attachments are getting boring now. Just sort the game out already
You know what's funny, I died to the No Glint Kar98 and thought I was stupid for not seeing the glint xD well Cod is at it again! Wohooo
Did you test glint for both zoom options of the variable zoom?
5 perks? Tipa?
That explains alot..I've been using variable on the kar
They want cold war to become popular so much that they are now breaking the balanced weapons of mw so that it can be on par to the cold war one. Funny thing is mw weapons should be superior to cold war weapons as those are developed in modern times than cold war's and improved upon.😂😂
Hope Raven and Treyarch both go into administration
WHAT ABOUT THE AX-50 ?!?
"hey uhh i think the cw snipers scope some don't have glint,you know how to fix it right?"  "Say no more"
I guess this is activision trying to get people to use snipers again instead of the Aug
Warzone was a accidental success, they dont have any idea how to manage and balance this game
I DO think that there should be a PERK that removes glint, but it should come at the cost of a slot... That's just my opinion though.
Jgod scaring bot players and then in return them thinking jgod is a bot.
Switching to variable optics now!!!
Im officially done with this game at the moment. Going to take a break until the reskin map drops
found the best new SPR class
Iron's wet dream comes true
Jgod can you test it again but use the higher zoom of the variable zoom scope
Slight of hand on the HDR not working therefore
So basically just snipe people until they fix it...got it.
Fully loaded perk is broken, had it on my amax but had no ammo
Serious question: Were you zoomed in with the 8x or were you testing this at the 3.5x focal length? I possibly missed you covering  this (sorry if so) but isn't it conceivable that the 3.5x wouldn't show but the 8x would?
why is jgod teaching this cancer? doesn't he want cod to be at least a tiny bit enjoyable?
Kar needs a nerf honestly
Can you make a vid on all dual wielding pistols then rank them beat to worst? I’m really curious how the not as popular ones preform
Next update. Automatic AR with explosives rounds ON EVERY ROUND!!!
The 20x scope has glint now. Not sure about the other optics. But 20x definitely has glint now.
so i dont need tac laser on the kar98?
I’m late, but hi jony
They fixed SUSAT glint, other variable zooms having no glint is probably a byproduct of that change.
Changing the HDR as I listen, thanks Raven! :D
I think the glint is stupid.  In blackout there was none and made it very challenging.
This isn't new! I've had one on the Peligton and the Kar98 for 2 months
3:45 Typical tracking of a plunder player. The most annoying part is they play that game mode seriously, reach the money cap quickly and don't let you level your guns. I guess they feel accomplished with so many plunder wins.
It is only fair. CW glints have no glint. Thus MW shouldn't have glint. Warzone is Balanced now, as everything should be
Game's a joke.. switching to apex
so did variable zoom get broken? or is this an intentional change?
Does the hangnan rf on the tundra have glint?
What about if you zoom on the variable? Like you said anything over 4x is a glint but a variable zoom not zoomed in is a 3x...
Everyone: If it ain't broke don't fix it. Raven: It was fixed, let's break it.
I knew I wasn't crazy.... I was in final circle in the hills and got kar98 shot in the head. Reviewed my death on Nvidia highlights and no glint.
I’m convinced Activision doesn’t know what they are doing and they watch JGODS videos to fix broken things 😂
I'm sure we always had these bugs the difference is that now people are taking a closer look, especially after finding out that weapons work different in Multiplayer compared to Warzone
Thank you so much for uploading this video! It was really informative
@JGod Heavy Hitter is broken also. One hits people, no matter what, when you're plating up. That is, of course, if you can pull it off.
And now everyone will be running no glint snipers,  I like the good ole days where people had to figure out good weapons for themselves
Since CW integration this game is a mess....
Sleight of hand ain't working too.
They broke the textures too, pop in is terrible now.
Did clicking L3 and changing zoom level make a difference? Thanks JGOD!
As I already told yesterday in chat, stopping power on Modern Warfare Weapons REDUCING the recoil. I tested it out. You're welcome
U r amazing bruh
Half this game is broken. GG man thanks for the effort.
No jgod what have u done
yep... as expected. warzone at this point is one big joke
No better than watching JGOD on my birthday
JGOD deserves a warzone nobel price ...
Ah yes. Finally some realism. Too bad it’s bad for balance.
I dont think this came with the update the HDR with variable didnt have a glint since last season
That game company is really pathetic
lol this happend to me i was guning down some1 and they just aimed at me doing nothing then i get headshoted
I swear this was already broken. I died to a guy in plunder with no glint on the hdr came back killed him picked up his gun and he had a variable scope
cant wait for the exploding smoke grenade bug
Imagine this guys in the lobbies you was testing. “ omg JGOD got turnt on” 😭😭😭😭😭 and the young god was just making test for the community.
Looks like everyone's using variable scopes today then! 🤣
It’s becoming more and more embarrassing how the patches and updates released in Warzone always break multiple things within the game.  There QA team needs to have a better checklist before confirming fixes have been made. They rely way too much on the community to point out issues and are extremely slow to address them
Is anyone suprised? Probably brought back invisibility and stim glitch as a package in the store
This will be fun 😂
Raven ruined this game.
Pls jgod stop you have a lot of power
WHERE MAH CX9 and RAAL AT RAVEN???
What about VLK on KAR
omg can Activision hire some competent studio to take over warzone ? its clear that Raven are just a bunch of amateurs
I thought this game could not possibly be more rewarding for campers.
Game has become to big for Raven to manage...
Already know I'm going to be triggered when i get sniped without glint
Next update: Helicopter rides YOU
Next patch to fix the m16... the rpg is now full auto with infinite ammo...
Been using the Rytec, with explosive rounds, as an anti-vehicle this last week. Works pretty well for me to disable vehicles. Also fun to plink people with it lol. Been running the AMAX and the Strella for end game in solos to negate the vehicle advantages. One shot to the front of a Bertha disables it. Second... well we all know what comes after that :)
Plot Twist: Your own optics determine if you see the enemies glint
Listen to the teacher guys
Kinda confused. So variable doesn't have a glint in wz doesn't matter on which gun.  Does the default hdr have one? So spr, Kar variable should be fine to use? 😅🤔
Kar is now even more op? Lol
Did you check whether no glint is only when it’s on its lowest variable zoom level
you beast. screen shot that, LETS GOOOO
Raven are completely useless. Thanks JGod.
Big ups to jgod tho for doing all of this
Jgod always dry snitching. This why we cant have anything nice. 🤡
This game is just a big joke
people who always used variable scope be like    We're gonna have a problem here...
I wonder how long that’s been going on. I’ve used variable zoom on the K98 for a LONG time.
These clowns can’t do anything right 😂 every update even playlist update they break the game even more
39k views in under a hour, now everyone is going to be sniping. 🤬
THis game sucks so bad now
I've gotten like 4-5 different updates in the past 48 hours. I think they see your videos and are trying to fix before others figure it out. Hopefully they pay you !
So that's why I couldn't find where I was getting smacked...
It's not activition if it doesn't break more stuff each time they try to fix anything lol 🤣 That's their thing
Yo people are lazy af if they didn’t know about this already
I only play bf5 now cause wz has gotten wayyy to messy
Yo, so I'm pretty new to playing games that get updated. I'm used to playing games that just had all the content in disc and that was it. Is this normal for a game to have so many issues whilst being updated?
HOW COME HE HAS GLINT, BUT NOT ME?!?!
Anyone noticed when you down people on a zip line they still continue to go up?
Kind of bad, although I am on the 200 kills using the variable zoom reticle challenge 🤔🤣
Hi louis
My issue is more that the Modern Warfare weapons don't have enough zoom.
JGods a winner we like him if we don't have him we wouldn't win
The FINN LMG adverse barrels are broken since the recent patch update, upvote this so JGOD can see this and make a video about it. Hopefully devs see and take note to fix this soon.
I think the glint only shows at an mid to long range
Battlefield 6 please come and save us
THE CODFATHER
Is the glint there when you are ADS at the player? In you're example at 4:22 it seems not which might explain why so many don't show the glint in the first half of the video
What is a glint??????
Short answer: use variable zoom optic for no glint
Cold War has been nothing but a disaster. Just get rid of it, and keep warzone with modern warfare
Thank you for all your work!
So in summary, all the variable zoom scopes have no glint. Are there any other scopes as well? Couldn't watch the whole video pls lemme know
FMJ has been nerfed. It takes 2x hits on vehicles and streaks now compared to pre-patch.
"BREAKING THE GAME AS THEY GO"  -JGod  Couldnt have said it better myself
Next Update Title: 'FOV'S Cannot Be Changed From 80, BUNDLES Can Be Bought With Bit Coin'
THE FINN RAPID FIRE BARREL IS BROKEN!!! IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE AFTER THIS UPDATE
dragunov ist 1shot headshot guys switch ur loadout now
It’s snipe city then
In our language, JGOD means God but with a J
Everyone is going back to the m16
Whats the count on how many times he says glint hahahaha
Hangman rf also now has glint like wtf
Do you post any of this info on Reddit? I feel like that’s the only place the Devs are researching to get info from because you and Ace and TGD have been posting videos about broken stuff for months that gets no recognition.
Or they intentionally broke it so it brings it on the level of cold war🤯
Activision need to recruit JGOD lol
This is broken but who's gonna use a variable zoom scope on the kar? The ADS is terrible with that thing
Sleight of hand doesn't work? My goodness!!!
i used the var zoom before it was cool
I remember my past naive self thinking "Well, CW weapons may be a mess, but at least I can be confident they won't touch the MW weapons" 😩
Man Ik JGOD was tryna not laugh this entire video😭. Warzone is turning into a joke man.
I’ve been running variable zoom since forever so, dub!
This game is so broken
This game being so broken must be the most frustrating thing for you to be able to keep up with. But thanks for putting in the work!
When JGOD talks, things get nerfed or fixed.
the god as spoken
I love that this game feels so much like Battlefield.   Every patch ruins the game. Until the last one, then the game will work great once everyone leaves.
Imagine you realize that you killed JGOD himself and then you watch this video.
This explains so much. I kept getting sniped last night and never saw glint. I was so confused.
A summary would be really helpful. It's really hard to find the 1 sec where you state the gun being tested
JGOD sacrificing his KD for the Warzone community  Bow down to the GOAT
Yooo they keep breaking this game, the last update got me fu*%ed up.  Dev Errors when attempting to play multiplayer with Picadilli, hardhat and other.  Whyyyyyyyyy?  Full uninstall/reinstall did not help.  What a joke!!!
Would the variable zoom matter if your zoomed out ?
I swear they are doing this on purpose to test JGod...
Anyone else’s finn lmg chainsaw attachment make it so there is no cross head
"If you wanna test this yourself, you can even go into MW multiplayer..." except I can't even do that cuz they broke my multiplayer with these stupid data packs.
We can't play the game without you JGod, thank you for all you do ❤️
Glint or not.... I'm taking you all down 😏
I m pretty sure i got killed by a guy using hangman rf and i could see his glint before dying
Should’ve just kept warzone as part of mw and not tried to integrate it with future cods... game would be so much better
My question is, when will all this bugs end? When will we be able to play Warzone normally again? It seems like there's a new glitch/bug everyday
These are the worst developers ever
CoD CampZone.
Delete this
Your dedication to providing accurate data and the intelligent testing methods are very much appreciated!
All of the attachments with all guns should just be a few tables that are easy to edit.  Not sure why they keep screwing this up and it really says something about the build.
Can someone give me a good tundra class?
Stop crying
Sleight of hand doesn’t work neither
I've got a feeling they're gonna release some reactive snipers in near future. Geez what a shitshow..
Tbh glints have been pretty inconsistent for me for quite a while now. Sad.
I recently got killed while i was using the Hangman RF scope on the Tundra, and i saw glint on the killcam, and when i got killed using the SUSAT i saw no glint, so i think the CW scopes have been reworked aswell.
When you are in a class but you prefer watching jgod
Snipers shouldn’t have glint unless your facing the sun anyway
I don't think they should have glint unless they are looking into the sun
Dude you are the doctor of warzone, you talk, we listen 😂
Videos like this just kills the game for me. Yeah let's show everyone the new broken gun.
How inept as a developer do you have to be to remove an essential Feature on accident? AGAIN Wtf
Imagine killing JGOD and then you later realize it was for a "does this optic have a glint" video LOL
Does it work in the variable thermal scope?
Haven't played the game for 3 months knowing the game will never be free of glitches and broken guns/attachments.
This is why I’m playing Apex rn over warzone
Is it possible that they only show glint at a certain distance and beyond?
JGOD is no nonsense hats off man
Just waiting for Activision to make Raven sit in the corner for their stupidity.
Was the no-glint scopes also tested beyond 100m?  If my memory serves me right, both CW and MW glint disables when you close a certain distance on the target  but fr tho, it should always have glint in WZ no matter the distance to avoid confusion.
I'd be super embarrassed to call myself Raven or activation gaming right now.. Great helpful vids thanks again as always well done JGOD
I swear they must have a dev in the back named Tim, that intentionally adds glitches and bugs into the game, and he spreads the words to his friends !
Raven: We have broken something  Also Raven: We have fixed.... The Self-Revive in Plunder   Ah yes who knew we needed that? Wow.
From playing last night and thinking people were throwing thermites at me it all makes alot of sense now wow lmfao 🤣😂😭
If it wasn’t for jgod snakeshots would still be meta
JGOD has full influence over my loadouts at this point
Wait so the variable zoom kar 98 doesn't show glint?
Go outside
I heard they nerfed the aug and ffar, I’m on vacation for a while, is this true boys?
I went up against a guy before the second update that was using the kar98k variable zoomscope and had no glint
Honestly I think you are part of the problem JGOD.... If you don't make a video about this legit no one would figure it out!
The only thing they don’t ruin is the store bundles 😎
But what about changing zoom level in the variable I am certain people see my glint when zoomed in
Hangman RF does have glint, at least on the M82 in Warzone.
O my god the explosive Rytec-AMR meta. YES 🤣
JGOD Is Activisions customer service department ☎️
does slight of hand work on non-snipers?
JGod out here sending "warning shots" at people; me (lower tier head shot player)
CW integration moment
Guys they broke snipers, the iron sights don't give glint... new meta?
father JGOD we praise your name
If everything is broken, nothing is broken.
Could you ad listof these glints to your bullet velocities list?
Man I can already hear the Jimmies spamming the rytek to my heli while i level up my guns in plunder
BF6 is going to end Warzone and COD...I can’t wait.
PLEASE LIKE THIS COMMENT... THE COLD WAR RPG SCIKENCE CHALLENGE IS BROKEN ITS MY LAST FOR DM AND IT DOESNT WORK
Unpopular opinion. Scopes should only glint when facing the sun.
Modern warfare shotguns are also broken (visually). I haven’t tried them all, but the non full auto and semi auto shotguns have around a 30%chance every game to load in extremely glitched, with the character model’s left arm flung in front of their face. It’s funny, but it needs to be patched.
They gotta keep you producing videos some how, amirite?
Community: “These no glint CW snipers are kinda unfair, can y’all fix it?”  Raven: “Don’t worry fam, we have the perfect solution!”
Keep your head down moving across the map lol
He's the only person who can reverse boost and I'm totally cool with it since its for "research purposes only". Love the vids bro keep them comin
JGOD is actually a god
Definitely gonna abuse this😂
Curious what % of the player base have gotten fed up now and quit? Balancing has been poor for a long time now and fixes are slow if at all. Personally I still play but less frequently, I’m ready for a new BR to take over
on the aug comment, you said you can tell how well the gun has been nerfed because people are still using it but isn't that the point of the nerf? the game is boring if everyone uses the same thing all the time and I understand that the aug was OP so everyone used it but nerfing it into the ground would just take it out of the loot pool and therefore mean one less usable gun. Like I think the aug nerf is now in a decent place if they buff some of the other guns (krig) to be usable and that's where we should be
love this man. love the content J!
I've never sniped before, but it looks like I have to now lol
SoH Needs a F Fix !!!! How can u F up a Mw guns???
Raven have to be doing this on purpose now. Surely they can't be this stupid.
Could the variable not glint when you're at 3.5 x but visible at 8x?
Ayo quick question, can I get away with running LC10 or is it bad?
I knew I saw someone using this
If they fixed slight of hand, I can care less about everything in these updates.
We're pretty much a test server raven is making us test broken weapons for months. It's a joke smh
It’s almost like watching the three stooges . Every time they tried to fix something, they broke something. I wonder what would happen for the season 3 update, there’s a very good chance they’re gonna ruin it.
How does that happen? Did someone just delete the game file "weapon glit" for the lolz?
Bro why would u even make a video exposing this
Hate the fact these amateurs are breaking MW mp also now.
Running the Oceanographer HDR, does this also apply to blueprints?
No wonder why my head was blown twice as much today
Take a shot every time he says glint
4:22 ouch
Raven is not a real company they’re just trolls
I just used the krig 6 and  won the  game with 16 kills
looks down at Kar98, slowly pats it.. yes my trusty friend we about to bring some pain.
It's only the VARIABLE ZOOM SCOPE RIGHT???
WTF is Raven doing
Next video: Kar98k is now fully automatic and has infinite rounds.
Honestly... Just shelf the game at this point! AUG gets nerfed, but M16 stays untouched. FFAR finally gets a miniscule nerf so I decide to run MAC10 with an LMG. Except I can't unlock the MAC10/Groza because apparently the patch reintroduced the challenges not tracking.  So I decide to just jump into Solos with AMAX/JAK12 - lose 2 rounds back to back to obvious aimbotters in like gold/plat lobbies.  It takes these guys months to fix even the most basic bugs/balancing issues. Warzone will never be in a playable state again at this rate.
Is it possible on the low zoom setting the glint is gone for the variable zoom, but high zoom it’s there?
Since the most recent updates, I haven't been hitting shots I'd normally hit with the Kar. Anyone else had this issue recently?
The reputation JGOD has built in the last year and how much his channel has grown are both INSANE.
This game started messing up since they added the CW intergration.
Vulture custom zoom has a glint now
So variable zoom scopes don't have glint? What about when you zoom in to 8x?
JGOD sacrificing his KD to help us, a true man!
raven sucks
3:38 Jgod be roasting activision🤣🤣🤣
Wait u didn’t show the hdr loadout
Petition for Jgod to use the FixWz clan tag
They day you reached xclusive ace subscribers
That implies that they are tweaking optics. I'd guess they are fixing it soon
COD should just hire him before the game completely dies because of bugs.
M16 or aug?
Mornin J
Bro I literally thought this but I thought it was a fluke. I thought my tests were wrong
So all thermals got glints?
so recap . the variable zoom scope has no glint?
I feel like they’re never going to get this CW integration right...
While many content creators will share these types of issues to get views, JGOD shares in order to get them fixed. We don't deserve him.
...stupid Cold War adding more issues and breaking things that works ... great job activision/ Raven you played yourself
Well, other then getting oneshots with my dragunov on full hp guys with 3 plates for reasons, this makes me want to use it even more...
Take a shot every time he says glint... *DEAD*
Yeah I won't be playing warzone with broken glint...
The Stim and Invisibility Glitch are probably back too after that update lol
It’s laughable that they can’t get this game balanced. I’m starting to think it’s done on purpose
Cyberpunk and warzone will fight for most buggy game award.
JGOD roasts everyone he spectates **Period**
Nice job.  Activision needs to hire you as a QC analyst.
Maybe it's just a killcam bug?
Why do we even play this game
Why TF would you post this?
Next update, glint on vlk sight and all iron sights. I'm calling it now.
JGOD, our lord and savior.
I stopped playing the game 2 weeks ago, every single time I see they broke the game even more and the meta unchanged (even after "NERFS") Just makes me feel like I made the right choice
Call of bug
How bad is Raven software? Honestly. How fuggin bad are they?
Fully Loaded didnt work for me lol
Finally I can use the rytec for once
Wait, wha
I’m easily the first one
What a disaster this is going to be.
Idk anything about game development, but it’s amazing how many new bugs they create with every update
This is a joke..
Great, more good news.
Uninstalling the game tonight
I listen to JGOD more than my school teacher in class
Yeah I was playing some Ground War last night and I swear I kept peeking windows and getting my head taken off despite never seeing anyone aiming
This game is utter garbage
Sieght of Hand isn’t doing faster reload because I use the MP5 with sieght of hand and it’s reloads it’s like if it never had sieght of hand
JGOD, What are your actual thoughts on how this game is being handled by Raven?
A no glint Kar98?  Time to play something else...
JGOAT
Why not just make this complaint to Raven, instead of making a video showing people how to use exploits?
"How can we make Warzone less fun?"   "Let's add no glint snipers."  -probably Activision & Raven
I think it might not be a bad idea to have the variable have no glint in the lower zoom... but for balance it will probly need zoo. Slowdown or worse ads... I'd prefer the zoom to slow down since you could have it already zoomed or not before ads-in and you dont want to nerf the kar98 ads.
The more patch updates we get, the more broken the game becomes
Whole game is just a complete joke now, and these people are still employed
you know they shift metas on purpose right ? go run buy bps
Warzone has become an absolute joke.
But how reliable is the killcamfor this testing? , It's shown in the past to show incorrect heartbeat markers and sped up gameplay.
No glint=headshot
that explains...
The Cold War integration was a bad idea!
JGOD is my shepherd i shall not want
This been happening for months in multiplayer no glint
I feel different the Fal, idk if they changed recoil or visual recoil, also the damage feels a bit different
Really poor patch testing, again... Another opportunity for JGOD to prove his worth, again... Thanks as always J!
5:25 do you guys know how to do that
lmao what's next Activision?
why do i feel that mw just does this on purpose to force people to use new metas
I wish Raven wasn’t involved with this franchise anymore.
I've come to the conclusion that the devs just don't play the game. Anyone who's played WZ in the past month or 2 knows how everything is broken.
I’ll try and have a great day after finding this news out 😢
This dude just live in a square in verdansk
😂 😂 😂 😂 It removed 5 kills streak  cap for CW camos 🤣 Got gold ffar in a day in KingSlayer
This man is honestly the goat
Dang son now I’m waiting to see what breaks when they “fix” this.
JGOD, can you go over the "copying add-on" issue for PS4 players. I haven't been able to play at all since the update. I've also tried all of the "fixes" on YouTube. Thanks if you see this :)
At least it's fair between CW and MW snipers both are broken equally....
I am GENUINELY SHOCKED that a company like Activision is still in business...
Activision needs to be paying you commission for all the testing you do!
Didn't think glint showed when looked at through scope in any case?
Activision best decision ever would be hire JGOD as Quality Assurance Manager :)
Well here we go again
I think the Hangman RF for Cold War does properly have glint now when it didn’t before. I don’t know exactly when it got updated, but I tested it in plunder and see glint in killcams
I use the variable zoom and there is glint, you tested some of these up close blank and well when your up close blank there is no glint unless u see some one at a distance
FIXWZ
Gonna get sniped across the map with a hdr now.
As I was thinking about playing some WZ again these kind of videos help me not to.... A documentary about how people work at Raven studios would probably make for an excellent tragic comedy.
ay jgod  I hope u see this can u play warzone normally I wanna see how smart u r at it
Mac 10 unlock challenge bugged is mad annoying
Like they want us to use certain weapons
How did they mess up the MW weapons? They weren’t even touching them. Wtf Raven
Ι am new here but i watch all your videos bcz i admire your work @JGOD 💪❤🔥
Warzone never fails to impress me how they break the game every patch.
people only switch loadouts when a new JGOD vid releases
Yes. True balance. Why only CW weapons have no glint. The person that is in charge of these be like Thanos. Everything is perfectly balanced and reality is whatever they wish it to be.
I really wish they ran tests on their updates before releasing them. It would take 3 days, 2 days for testing and 1 day to put all the data together and prioritize game breaking issues.
What about ar/lmg. Do those variable zoom scopes also have no glint?
Now they will release another patch where they will secretly bring the aug back to it’s no recoil state and make more skins for it. War zone = money for the devs.
This game is just broken
I'm sniping all day today
At this point I'm convinced they have a bug development team.
It’s crazy how bad the cod developers do there job that YouTubers have to do it for them it’s so sad
Jgod doesn’t use guns.          Guns use Jgod.
Fmj didn’t work for me in mp lol
No hate, but does anyone feel like this is the beginning of warzone’s downfall?
I think they wanted this, I mean it didn't happened in one year and it happens now, wtf
yoooo
Raven needs to fire their entire staff and hire a new set because they fix one thing and break 50.
There’s no way a company full of computer savvy people can do this type of stuff on accident it’s all on purpose..
This is a big yikes.
They fix one thing and end up breaking the other
I love this game but I just recently deleted it off my Series X. Too many hackers. Too many broken guns. Xbox forced cross play. Sbmm....ect.  Fired up Battlefield 5 to start getting ready for BF6 and wow it feels different. 😬
Wow thank you jgod you just ruined the game again
JGOD, I’ve seen nobody mention the reticle issue on Cold War guns. On the 2x,3x and 4x about half of the unlockable reticles are blurry and are unusable.
Good idea that troll rytec lol
Are there any weapons which arent broken? Everything is bugged. Didnt even fix the MW perks...
This sucks, cuz when Raven fixes this, they'll probably fix the Tundra too. No Glint was the best reason to USE the Tundra! Otherwise Kar98/HDR are just plain better
Hey Maa. Come quickly, look, look, I killed JGOD!
I died, didnt see the glinch and didnt undertand... thx for this
So I can use an spr with variable zoom and have no glint? Bettttt.
WOW LOL so that explains why a guy in ATC I was trying and failing to hit with HDR/Variable  from the mountains yesterday didnt turn and shoot back. These devs are hilariously bad...
in my opinion u r probably the most respected person in the COD community I hope people help u with these I really do appreciate It
BOCW scopes have glint now. Vulture Custom and Hangman RF for sure do.
RAVEN, APRIL 1ST IS ALREADY OVER
Agh. Another thing that’s broken and another dumb thing I’m going to die by. Is Raven ever going to fix warzone.
This man doesn’t miss!!!!
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS BROKEN! I kept getting hit my HDRs with no glint
The effort in the plunder testing tho we appreciate u j god
Without JGOD Warzone would have not made it this far
Well this is great, just great 👍
Basically use a variable scope on snipers and marksman rifles for no glint 👍🏾
I'm cracking up because I literally tweeted you on Tuesday "what did they break this time JGod" 🤣😂🤣😂😭
what about variable thermals ?
This about to be OP
They should’ve never merge Cold War with Warzone
glint was already inconsistent af
I've always used variable.. this explains why my deathcomms literally had people losing their mind saying "from where!" Multiple times.
Man every update more bugs....
"still using the AUG after its been nerfed 3 times. that tells you how well it was nerfed" lol
Fun fact: Saying MW has the same number of syllables as saying Modern Warfare. No shortcuts there!
Its funny how all of these problems started once raven took over
Jezus
This game is so bad lol
Every warzone update is 1 step forward, 99 backwards
Modern warfare was the best cod. Warzone war decent they had some things to iron out but I enjoyed it UNTILL the Cold War integration and now we have issues like this. My god man, I’m glad I put the game down a few weeks ago.
That explains the random Rytecs in my solo matches and why I couldn’t find them
Couldn’t this just be a killcam glitch like the heartbeat sensor?
The more they add/fix the more problems we get 🤣
I love you and appreciate you jgod just letting you know
Thanks... I think... lol  No seriously, thanks JGOD. Would never know about this stuff if you didn't post it.
literally to the 1% who’s reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true stay safe and have a wonderful day (:
Yo 7 minutes agoh I’m finally early
Can you provide a list?
“Here we go again...”
Dang that crazy
Im abouta busssss
I want sleight of hand back. MW MP5 reload is so slow
Dang JGOD is just roasting everybody when he’s testing the glint on killcam lmao
I really liked your shirt in this video JGOD I love Spider-Man and his comics. I also love the Hulk shirt ive seen u wear its cool
No glint kar 98 is the only cheat i need 😋
ENOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUGH OF THESE NOWWWWWWW.... COME ON ACTIVISION COME ON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lol
I work a full time job now and can’t be a hardcore gamer, real adult now lol. So I appreciate your videos keeping me in the Meta so I can not get pooped when I play. Thanks dude
ah yes the cringey comments have started
Almost at 1 million subs 🔥🔥🔥
Oh lord, I'm about to abuse this so bad. I hate myself for it but I never used the DMR and I've barely used the AUG so I've earned this 😂
Pin me plz
What about the Thermo for the tundra?
Fix the cheater problem. I have proof that there's thousands of people using cheats. not every cheater rages and makes cheats obvious. most just use walls to pass as good players. message me for more info.
So does this work for the AX-50?
Next update: "MW Guns doesn't do damage." "CW Ak-47 TTK drops down to 0.83 milliseconds."
With the variable scopes were you zooming at max zoom?
do you think the day will come, where this game isn't broken in some obvious way..............yeh me neither *sigh*
"How well it was nerfed"😭
They broke slight of hand in mw multiplayer somehow.
Why listen to activision when you have Jgod
Make a video about slight of hand I want my glory back!!
I noticed this yesterday and I kept getting sniped but I didn’t know from where and it kept pissing me off
🙏
This was happening pre 1.34 update.
Of course.   How can Raven not attempt to fix something, fail, and then break something completely unrelated.
How do they even break this stuff, like there's no way this just happened on accident
Thanks bro just died from a camper
omg this guy hase more motivation to do his videos than mine for just getting up from bed
Wow.....
Jgod is a legend in the cod community
Hey tough stuff. Some other changes that have been made appear to include some netcode changes which are making gunfights more of a lottery. Have you considered reinvestigating battle nonsense style?
Lol watch everybody snipe u with no glint
Early😀
Fun fact: There are more planes in the ocean than submarines in the sky.
Time to get back on that obsidian grind for the K98
Game over man.
Thanks for the Kar update thats all i need lol
Oh almighty JGOD I have to ask, did the ram 7 get a nerf
I like how nobody finished the vid yet (I didn't either) lol
Activision should just hire JGOD for real
Man, quality updates! Fix one, break two, bring back old bugs!
I just wanna go back to the Kilo/grau meta with the r9o shotgun
FIRST
My daily dose of JGod😌
I've been reported so many times for being good with these. This is the first time I've been up on something before JGOD! My team feels special lol
JGOD is the GOAT
new meta
When JGOD talks, you listen.
Wtf this is gonna break the game specially if this is in any good snipers hand
Everyone is gonna be saying “WHAT WHERE DID I GET SNIPED FROM” for months
