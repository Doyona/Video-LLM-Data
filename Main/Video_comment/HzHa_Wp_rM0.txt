I know my stream schedule is stupid and dumb, but I'd love if you followed my Twitch so you can be first to know when I stream <3 Might stream today/this weekend https://www.twitch.tv/circletoonshd
It's been 3 years and the ending still makes me laugh.😂😂
Then there's the games that have glitched quest items that take up inventory space and you cant get rid of after the quest........you all know the game I'm talking about.
Saints Row 3. The very first mission is raiding a military base and getting a drone strike laptop. You can only keep like, three ammo on you at all times, but when it only needs one shot to full-clear half the game's content, it's a little moot.
reminds me of the m60 you get from the helo mission in GTA vice city. as far as I'm aware you can't get more ammo than what the game gives you, not even with the in-game typeable cheats, but it's nearly as potent as the minigun. great emergency tool early game.
How did I miss this video?
it’s either that or it just takes up space.
You actually were supposed to return it by finding your uncle in another spot on the map after you completed the mission. Yeah the devs didnt know how to remove an item from your inventory at the time and just slapped in an extra version of the uncle once they figured it out.

What’s the quest to get that knife?

This video literally reminds me of that one meme template where some guy pulls out a rocket launcher in front of a robber. It's like that final scene was inspired off of that meme template or something. I'm not sure though.  EIther way, inspired or not it's super hilarious and I love it.
Honestly your characters would probably make good nfts
borderlands in a nutshell
Im dying, this is amazing
It’s like playing mgs4 and just getting every story weapon in existence by end game.
Just never turn in the quest.  In Borderlands2, take the Marcus gun test quest and don't turn it in and you've got a permanent maliwan pistol that scales to your level and doesn't take up an inventory slot.
people suffering from psychosis are multitudes more likely to be harmed by neuro typicals than the other way around; throwing around "psychopath" is harmful
But what if it was the other way around. The weapon was shitty and take space in the inventory and you can't remove it
Doing those kinds of movements without fingers is pretty impressive 0:32
Walking around Detroit open carrying an RPG7 is the only way to keep shit in Detroit
And here I was thinking this was a sneaky way to frame you for.... Well I guess what you did indeed actually do.
Hello Gordon! Nice RPG, you've got there!
Mafia 3 for example when you complete a DLC I think you get a dart gun and can like instantly knock out people
You forget the part where you just start the mission just to steal the story items
I was expecting that when he kept it, it was going to get nerfed so bad its useless
the Nataruk in Warframe be like
UTTER PERFECTION!!
Warframe. Nataruk.
That explosion is looking immaculate :)
This is kinda like when you get skippy in cyberpunk then just… don’t return him…
Stabbin' knife sam is a memorable first boss.
Anyone remember that time when Far Cry let you keep a bear?
"Boom,(foreshadowing) have you ever been mugged before!?"
Or it is an amazing weapon in the cut scene, then you get it and it is absolute crap
Alternatively: getting a sick quest item... then never turning in the quest so you can keep it.
That last bit gave me serious fallout vibes.   Just, a raider charging someone that has a rocket launcher is like, the norm

I would play an entire game styled like this with this same humor.
Imagine keeping the James Bonds Aston Martin DB5 un GTA V. The one with the guns and spikes. But nope, when you buy it it is disarmed for "safety".   Some might say you can arm it again in offline. Here's the thing: I can't play online (PS3 user here and I refuse to buy the game for PS4. Aaaand my PC is a potato, won't run it). So no, playing online won't cut it. I want to troll NPC's by making my car shit spikes and they get their wheels popped. A simple desire, man
that scream at the end killed me lmaoooo
Hahaha lmfao, thx
The 27$ was not the reward. The real reward was the RPG BOOIIIIIII

What about never progressing a quest so you can keep the story item?   Looking at you Skeleton Key.

yea cool rpg but did u see that knife movement
I’m remember keeping the Skeleton key in my Skyrim playthroughs. Having an unbreakble lock pick was just so convenient.
Okay okay okay, as a knife enthusiast and person who likes to do knife tricks, this was a total nightmare

The RE4 instant boss killing rocket launcher
Best item from a mission I can think of: The Grog Nozzle in Borderlands 2. It makes you drunk! It has a really high slag chance! It heals 65% of all damage dealt while held! IT MAKES YOU DRUNK!
And that's the only rocket you will find for the next 20 hours of gameplay
Damn, i thought this was gonna go a different way. Like how the RPG will have infinite ammo for the mission but after you keep it you don't have that anymore and RPG ammo is scarce or limited.
The only thing that ran through my head at then end was "Parry this you filthy casual"
or you're to scared to use it/get rid of it because you might need it later

I hate when they let you keep it but it is no longer the same.   Gets monstrous weapon that doesn't need reloading and has infinite ammo.   After the Level  it's broken in some way but is now just like any other weapon besides its looks.
Eminem said it best
Alternate version: You get to keep a story weapon but you can't find ammo for it until the endgame.
Or when a game lets you keep keys that are used for one door
I love he was using the normal knife as a butterfly knife
Finished Halo Infinite enjoyed having the bosses weapons.
I spent 100,000 gold to duplicate a main quest ring you have to give to the duke in dragons dogma dark arisen, after it was stolen by a crazy sorcerer dude, there's a guy who runs a shop in the kingdoms alleyways who can make a fake of every item in the game for certain prices, If i give the duke the fake one he won't be able to tell the difference, the guy in the shop is good for duping upgrade materials that are hard to come by, or items you can't normally get, essentially anything can be duped, if it's an item with a unique affect however the fake version does diddly squat, which is why I gave the fake to the duke, so i keep the original ring, the ring boosts casting speed for the sorcerer and all other casting based classes by 10%. It's worth the the 100k gold though.
Unless it’s Splatoon 2.   Then it’s a rip off.
that yell at the end was so perfecT
THAT IS A WAR CRIME DO NOT DIRECT IMPACT INFANTRY
It's actually the opposite most times, the story item is only useful in that specific story mission and they force you to use it and then immediately after you just switch back to your old weapon because the game expects you to be at a certain level that you probably past just by doing a little bit of grinding

Rocket launchers are kinda bad to be honest

That's misleading, most story items are completely useless and a waste of space.
I love it when I'm caring a story weapon.
*cough cough* HALF LIFE 2 *cough cough*
does it bother no one that he's probably level 3 after that story mission and the level 12 he just killed didn't take him to level 12, it took him to level 5?

Just Cause 3 in a nutshell
As a game designer, I like to let players keep their story weapons. I want people to have fun. Your uncle gave you something cool? You can keep it.
This is fine. I’m more concerned about that “Memento” key item that sits in your inventory and is never mentioned by anyone ever.
Some people bring guns to a stabbing... well and than there was Shawn with an RPG-7 ... let's just say he realized half a second to late that firing this thing at a target next to him, wasn't his smartest but his very last idea... before he of course respawned and continued doing stupid stuff and dieing endless more times mostly by his own hand.
we all know that rocket launcher doesn't do squat after the mission.
usually by the time you get the gun out the npc kills you already
Eat your cereal please
When you do all the side quests before the main story line
ye... sure. fire a rocket launcher when standing right in front of the guy. thats smart.
Just Cause
Them knife skills were scary but the rpg is scarier.
I absolutely loved it! Creativity of this animation shines through vast majority or YouTube content and humour is like a deliciously sweet cherry on top.
Bad ass
love the explosion
that's a awesome glitch. Go tell the speed running community about it, I'm sure they'll find it useful.
could of went ether way. after the mission could of been nuked in power or kept its power

I love when games have weird quirks like these that allows you to become overpowered so easily.
oh whats this? skeleton key? cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool... what? you want it back? haha
The Grog Nozzle.
Look at those knife skills, I've never seen anything like it
Gta story mode be like:
The Elder Scrolls 4, Umbra, the best sword in the game, if you don't turn the quest iin, the sword will stay a quest item and can't be taken from you, even if you're thrown in prison.
An acceptable response for being mugged
In farcry 3 there's one mission where you get the flamethrower to burn a WEED farm and you get to keep it, but that doesn't mean the flamethrower was good,     There were about 5 other missions where you actually get an op weapon for free  BUT YOU DON'T GET TO KEEP THEM I could really use a goddamn grenade launcher 30% into the story
Inaccurate: the new comers would be blasting everyone with rockets and abusing it making the game a total warzone
Gta belike
I loved the ending
Yeah ive played one of those games before but theres a lvl cap that you have to be lvl “some random number” or higher to use this
Speaking of rpg (not the gun the game .which he is using an rpg in an rpg lol)  but does anyone know any good rpgs that resemble any of his rpg videos? I want something fun like that to play
DID YOU USE YOUR phone camera to film your monitor wtf is this quality
You sure did terrorism back there, here's 27 bucks.
why did this made me remember when eminem pulled a rpg on a robber https://youtu.be/r_0JjYUe5jo?t=75
“Great job kiddo, y-you sure committed terrorism back there”
the scream at the end
You know, he needed to be level 12 to unlock that knife taunt. But only need level 1 to be blown up by story locked rpg
This is like Indiana Jones when he shot the swordsman. Ya look at my mad skills u must be terrified but gets shot
Those knife skills had me dying 🤣😂
Ye like Johnny's gun in cyberpunk,but it sucks ass
Yeah, that's gta online in a nutshell.
As the old saying goes: Never bring a knife to an RPG fight... Or something like that.
Not quite the same, but there's a mission reward in GTA 3 that was effectively a Bulletproof Jeep.  I had used it in the prior mission and part of the reward was to keep it in your garage.  I immediately jumped in to take it for a personal test drive, but the garage that it spawned in had some strange edging on the exit ramp that caused the front tire to snag and forced me into a hard left turn accelerating up the left wall.  The car immediately flipped over on its back, burst into flame and exploded killing me and leaving my garage inventory forever.  Still kinda stings.

Like Aryll’s Telescope from Wind Waker… only she gets kidnapped before you can give it to her and it’s pretty useless… Nice animation tho
i.e. skeleton key
To quote Eyezayar: “if you try to rob someone and they pull out dynamite for self defense, the best course of action is to run”
i'm just a nigga with a rocket loncher
I absolutely love games where they show you a crazy weapon that you immediately fall in love with. One that might even have utility even if it gets outclassed later. For some reason I keep thinking about a rail gun. Like the one Fortune used in MGS2.  The important thing is that eventually you get to keep the weapon and use it whenever you like. For me that makes a game fun and rewarding. (Comically powerful shotguns that ragdoll enemies like they are crash test dummies are great too.)
"You cannot discard story-related items"
I was expecting it to be stupidly weak and useless after the story quest it was used in
I thought it be like on sunset overdrive that u make a superpowerful sword with powers, but at the end of the mission it just becomes a normal sword
This reminds me of the Gary 23 glitch from Fallout 3 Aid the Outcasts.
The only keepable story item I remembered was a phallic rock
0:23-0:26 That short interaction got me. Just the look on Uncle's face and the text popping up every time he ignored Nephew...small details but made me laugh.     Also perfectly cut off scream at the end.
Borderlands says hello 👋🏻
in gta when you get 1* for being a vigilante but dont have time for the street cops shit.
I dont undestand the enemy in games    Like in genshin   The human anemys see that you have the arcgon puppet in your team and yet still attack you    They hide it by saying there stupid and thats how they become thieves or just poor as fk poorer than Mona
I remember my grandpa gave me his flamethrower…..he’s now in a vase

Imagine trying to rob someone only for them to pull out an rpg. Then again you don't really need to imagine that since it's in the video
Just cause 3 ending be like
and then they both died in the explosion, the end.  This is why even with an infinite rocket launcher; you really don't wanna close the distance with your enemy, unless you're doing a kamikaze build.
ACCURATE
Basically Half Life
the sad thing is  limited ammo or onetime ammo
So here is this super cool item that transforms you into a dragon for this quest just give it back to me after you finish the quest. ... Hey where are you going... The quest is still active... 5 years later: i don't think he is coming back
Not very relatable. wasting an RPG missile on a single enemy is super overkill and not worth it unless you have unlimited ammo on that thing
You should have just made the ninja dude stare at your RPG in the end then blow him up. not immeaditly blow him up lol
That was some fine knife wielding
Npc: Where the hell does he keep all the weapons another NPC: yeah now you mention it didn’t he died like six times
You forget about the times the game guilt trips you by giving you a weapon that you’ll never use
Then they make the ammo impossible to find
Fake that legendary RPG should deal damage equal to a peeble after 1 hour of gameplay
The lack of top comments about those knife moves hurt me.
That's some good errorisms, keep it up champ!
I half expected the "powerful in quest" item to be completely useless after the quest is done and like wtf why is this not working-
This is like being given the plasma cutter in dead space

I watched your vids for a while now and you need to make your own game with all your oc game charecters from these animations it would be so sick
Maybe not intentional, but in fallout new Vegas, if you do the introduction quest for Boone, where he gives you his beret as part of the quest, you keep the beret in your inventory if you equip it, and he will have a duplicate. It's a pretty cool head piece that pares well with the Elite Riot Gear

I know I just watch this channel but I got a video suggestions it's called "When the boss is too hard" Where the boss skill is very hard and no way to dodge and when you finally in the halfway in turn to phase 2 Where it's the HARDEST and you quit. I think this is not gonna get famous but let's see
It's even better if you get an overpowered weapon towards the end of the game that you can carry over into New Game +

Never show your knife skills to a rocket launcher guy .
In watchdogs 2 after the second story mission there’s instantly a quest were you steal a car, you keep this car afterwards and no longer need to waste half a million bucks on any others because it’s the best car in the game.
Great also was this a gta reference if not what game

This is like the Eminem meme lol
Been a long time since I un subbed and I’m not regretting it
Gotta be lvl12 to do this kinda shit baby!
The last part is just Indiana jones
Naw he wants it back but the item is too powerful so you never complete the quest but keep the item.
Reality: (fart sound effect when the story quest item does less damage to an NPC than some random item drop that you picked up) ... Well, brick.
Every Developer looking over the story and side quest reward, yep nothing will go wrong perhaps doesn't even need a patch.  That foreshadowing :
I laughed 🤷‍♂️
Or in RPGs, where you keep the story item, but it's literally just an icon in your inventory and does nothing.
That ending was FIRE
far cry be like
Reminds me of that one Gta game where you get a pistol with unlimited ammo but if you never complete the mission you can just use the unlimited ammo pistol forever
Ok this might have been the best one ever
"you gotta be level 12 to do this type of shit" proceeds to get blown up with rpg  sounds like a lot of games lets be honest

Aren't there cases where your epic story item becomes yours at last but is only as good as the 2nd most expensive weapon in the shop?

Kalina Ann wants to know your location.
When you run into an early side quest you missed halfway through the game
Can you make a game it’s would be really fun
This feels like the Eminem meme reimagined with game logic. I don't know why my brain thought of it. Just felt it should be noted
You know the game is good when you get to keep all the over powered story weapons
The twist is that the mugger is so over-leveled that you barely did any damage to him :v
ohhhh no a knife if only I had a weapon to instantly kill them *slowly pulls out rocket launcher* oh wait I DO *explosion*
reminds me of Umbra from Oblivion. One of the best 1-handed bladed weapons in the game, IIRC found in the first optional dungeon you see and counts as a quest item so no carry weight (and probably can't even be confiscated).
In my experience story items are only ever useful in the context of the mission you got them in and sometimes not even then. An RPG is usually great for taking out single heavily armored enemies or does hardly any damage through their armour because "elite enemies are supposed to be strong", in which case an automatic rifle or a shotgun are usually better for getting through the damage reduction.
They have to make a Mackanic where if you don't return the quest item they obviously want back that they gave to you after a certain period of time, the Character personally Hunt's you down anywhere in the game. Doesn't matter if you're paused or in another mission, or even an umpassible doorway without the key. And they do enough damage to make the Rock Hard Johnson weep
I genuinely don’t know how people click the dislike button on this
WAIT DID YOU SAY FAIMLY
i'm the mugger when i find a player who looks easy to kill
That scream of pain at the end XD
You just pull a gun on a guy with a missile launcher
It do be like that.
When you're still doing a thieves guild quest and realized that you have the skeleton key in your inventory and you're in a jail. You: time to escape Guards: must've been the wind You: gets caught Guard: found you 100+ bounty added

thats cool and all, but sometimes the item is completly unecessary and the game forces you to keep it, real pain if i do say so myself
The Just Cause series in a nutshell

It’s usually crappy and the good item breaks
This like that one mission in far cry 3 where you have to torch fields of weed with a flamethrower and you get to keep said flamethrower

I managed to trcik the game into letting me keep this sniper in far cry 3 Explosive Sniper rifle and I was able to use the orig sniper too so I had a silenced anti tank sniper and then a real anti tank rifle
Don’t bring a knife to a rocket launcher fight.

Who brings a knife to an RPG BATTLE      Rocket propelled grenade Not the  Role playing game  Will fit too
The knife animations look 🤌 fabulous 🤌
My pals down at Big MT have a thing or two to say about that.
man
Morale of the story here never a bring a Knife to an RPG fight lmao.
And that was the only rocket the game gave him after finishing the quest. The rocket launcher then sat on his weapon scroll wheel for the rest of the game until the final boss where it then gave three rockets, all of which were instantly outclassed by his level 30 knife skills.
When you get a new knife skin 0:33
To be more accurate the RPG has to become nearly useless and barely able to do a significant amount of damage to the next ennemies
All this makes me think of is Skyrim and the Skeleton Key. I never completed that story quest once I got it. I don't even know what the final cutscene looks like. I just ran off with my unbreakable lockpick
I knew what was going to happen and I still laughed   Better than what I was imagining even
I'm reminded of final fantasy 3. See, there's an item you get early on for the story in final fantasy 3 called an Elixir, and it restores all your health. you need it to cure someone's illness. Thing is, there's an item duplication glitch in FFIII, and you can duplicate and use the elixir, meaning you have infinite uses of a story item that fully heals you right after the start of the game.
Hey man. Youtube unsubbed me to your channel. But I'm back and resubbing for  awesome content
It's been awhile since I laughed out loud. Thank you, that scream had me dead
Of course there's the item that's op for the story, but when you actually get it it's not the same effectiveness
The scream at the end, its sooo good.
lets be honest.. the thief had some sweet knife skills
I was fully expecting the rpg to bounce off his chest and do exactly 3 points of damage. One of those 'We grant you use of this weapon, but we do not grant you the power it had when the boss used it against you.'
we ALL had that one person in a vidio game that said one smug comment to much and we just unleast hell onto before reloading
had the same feeling back in the days when i first started destiny2 and they gave me a grenadelauncher
Don't Bring a Knife to an RPG fight - You'll Lose!!
Thought this was gonna go in the direction of theyre always bad in comparison to the weapons you already have equipped
Do you know actual animation?
This is literally me after i get the bazooka in hl2
Alternate title: when you get the most op weapon in the game at level 1
The fucking scream at the end is what gets me
Pewdiepie be like 0:33
Those moments are the best because then the ability to play around has only increased.
Pog terrorism
Thank you for these animations really puts a smile on my face
This video sponsored by the USA
sadly I can't use the story item after the mission is completed, but it stays in the backpack as garbage :')
Perhaps in the final mission when a rival family attempted to kill you but instead killed your uncle which then keads your character to go on a murderous rampage but halfway through the weapon starts to malfunction and can only launch one more rocket; if you save that last rocket for the boss then you unlock the hidden achievement-Uncle's Memento....
Those knife flips were super skilled.
Thank you for shooting that mugger. He was a really shitty character.
“Here’s 27 bucks” lmao
Dont u hate when it takes sapce in ur inventory and u cant even scrap it
1000 comments
I see, the mugger must have been PewDiePie with those sick knife skills...
That bandit reminded me of this guy https://youtu.be/YQTn1QxCZ2s
It’s all fun till you realize that it has limited ammo and you can’t get more.
Holy hell that's good
What I hate is when you can't get rid of it and you start carrying dozens of "important items"
Me: Why am I suddenly moving so slow? Oh! I’m over encumbered! Imma just drop this—  *Story item cannot be dropped.  And a mob approaches.  Me: ….Fuck.
I feel like most weapons you get after missions are not the right type of weapon I mean you'll get daggers or something when you are a mage
But there's like 7 Rocket Launcher rounds scattered throughout the map.
Lol, that's the feeling I get when I rush the Grognozzle in Borderlands 2!
Thought this was about how weapons are much weaker when you get it, but this is still damn accreate
I'm still mad about the Dark Souls 3 storm ruler.
I liked the hoodie man's voice
Yes
Woah…  How did they get Danny Devito in this?!?
When you play soldier and there’s a spy
If i heard that scream 1000 times, id laugh every time
Then you realize the explosion does next to no damage so it goes in a box forever
Hehehe
I've never played Far Cry but this seems like Far Cry
When you try to show that your better than someone but you fail
"Yeah of course, anything for family "
And then they update and nerf it  XD
Just like new vegas
Dying light:
"You gotta be level 12 to do this kinda sh** baby!" is now my new favorite quote.
keep the story item but they become garbage from then on ex: Stormruler
Now he can take the knife, if it wasn't  blown to pieces.
Hey I wonder what are your thoughts on halo infinate
Don't forget to nerf it to the ground so it's just an another ordinary rocket launcher, with a naming that refers to the quest so you can feel good about yourself 😀
I love your Channel can I get a shout out
Just cause 3 when you get the mini nuke launcher:
Not sure if beard or chest hair or a combination.
Give us real foodage of ur shadow demon that watchs you sleep his name is HDHDBDGDS and likes to play checkers You know that one right ya real foodage
You could rename this  “When you get an overpowered weapon from the tutorial” And it would still make sense
In a normal universe, that thug would be unstoppable. Pity he came too late. His time was way before that story mode
Borderland be like:
Story Item: Useless Pebble Item Description: used at quest 5837382 and takes up a whole row of inventory  Player Attempts to Drop Item: “This is a undroppable item”
me, in genshin impact ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Such a well drawn explosion
When you bring a knife too a RPG fight😏
Every hour I have to watch something stupid at  daytime
You should do when a game makes you a bad item from the store. That would be good
When the game lets you keep story weapons there either op or underpowered when you get them
Woah
hey circle could you pls make a video on paper mario and the thousand year door i love the game too and would love to see it cover'd by a true fan
You should do one where the game introduces a new mechanic that can only be used in one mission and is never acknowledge again for the rest of the series
When a Game Lets You Keep the Story Item 333,369 viewsSep 10, 2021 i have landed a good view count
Saints Row the 3rd. The second mission ever just gives you a drone strike computer. There are then multiple missions that you can one-shot complete.
*0:39** looks like oversimplified history of Russia*
LOL
I just don't do the mission and keep the weapon
I wish my uncle gave me a rocket launcher :,(
Halo
such great attention to detail @ 0:18. he gives $27 as a reward, and hes holding six bills. a 10, three 5’s, and two 1’s.  $10 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $1 +$1 = $27  also those bills look like the most crispiest crunchiest dollars ive ever seen in my life.
Then proceeds sell/dismantle this family heirloom  a few levels later
Videogames 102: If you're not man enough to nuke a guy two feet in front of you, you're not man enough to use it at all.
We might have to break down that epic knife handing at 0:33 haha. CircleToonsHD never misses.
Me: Slowly turns to Breath of the Wild
Is this pixel gun?
I love your art style 🥰❤️
Clash of clans be like
I remember getting the infinite durability armor from operation Anchorage in Fallout 3 by glitching a body into the pod and putting all the gear the game won't let you keep in him.
Your videos make me so happy when I'm sad
Loud = funny.
Lol
YouTube says to keep clean but I heard them say the word shit this is not clean and it is promoting violence My comment to this video always get this crap off my webpages and don’t put it back on here anymore I am deleting emails and I don’t ever want to see this kind of stuff on my YouTube channel again I hope YouTube understand sis do you wanna just want to promote violence promote it somewhere else I’ll give you a thumbs down totally👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😖😖😖

The story item either has a super-cool design and is really useful, or the most common situation, it has a super-cool design and is immediately outclassed by your other upgraded items.
0:39...Rocket Fuel gadget in a nutshell
Plsss make another friday night funkin video trust me you gona get a lot of subs and viewers if you start making friday night funkin vids :).
50 on trending
It's either a random thing that takes up space or a weapon that is amazing at the start but unless half way through
Ngl that old guy looks like trevor phillips
CircleToons sounds soo similar to Barry the Chopper from Full Metal Alchemist it's scary
Reminds me of in HL2 when you get the RPG you can jump off the cliff onto the hidden path and just skip that boss entirely. Leaving them to die against combine aircraft with their only RPG in your hands.
Marvelous knife fighting display!
I haven't played Skyrim in years, but I'm preeeety sure I never gave back that unbreakable lockpick.
🤫 https://youtu.be/-n8MWhhzAWQ
I love when games do is. I remember my disappointment when Resident Evil 6 didn't let you keep the rocket launcher after completing Leon's Story
The mugger said level 12 meaning he was playing a online game, that’s pretty realistic
the animation get me everytime i love it
23 hour
This just speaks skyrim
but you only get 2 extra ammo that cant be found anywhere else
I played this time travel puzzle game in poptropica where you had a time machines clock which sent you to different time periods to fix the future. When I finished it, I somehow got to keep the flying machines and other ancient gadgets, INCLUDING the time machine. Sometimes I got sick of playing other games so I used the time machine to go to another time period and exit the game from there.
Me with my pencil: 0:34
Was that a PewDiePie cameo flipping his knife?
Love your content!! It's so well produced. Stay safe everyone 🌞🌻🍒
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Oh noo, anyway.
Gotta commit any type terrorism for that yummy yummy 27 bucks
The flamethrower in GTA III 👌
This is just Trevor. I swear Trevor gets the highest amount of weapons out of all characters from the story alone, including the RPG.
RPGs do indeed solve many problems.
That knife trick was so realistic. XD
Well I mean, that's knife skills is certainly something I've never seen before
That was a good laugh 😂
"You sure committed terrorism back there." That line got me.
Than the game will make a lot of money
Far Cry 5 be like: yeah, you can have my amazing 'Murica truck with heavy artillery that I love so much and my son that somehow survived a civil war on Indian something that I think I don't hate
That's true talent (knife spinning) 0:32
When things goes free to play:   Me:This is where the fun begins!
I swear, Rawr's claw literally saved my life in Dead Money, whoever in Obsidian thought of making his claw from Lonesome Road a quest item is a genius, those Sierra Madre ghost people were no joke
knife amongus
This is literally Far Cry
In game tutorial “don’t use heavy artillery on weak enemy’s” every player ever: rocket go boom
Then there's the other side of this, where the story item isn't a weapon or anything useful, but it stays in your inventory taking up space and time. You might think "well, it's still there, maybe it's used for something else", so you don't want to just throw it in a box or drop it on the ground, but it turns out it's never used for anything ever again so it just stays in your inventory for all eternity.
Your robber impression kinda sounds like Stamper, and it caught me way too off guard for a second
This is just Just Cause 3
It's the simple things.
Remember when Eminem said "you just pull a Pistol out to a guy who has a missile launcher " this is that scene
So that guy wearing yellow got an rpg when he was seven?  Lucky bastard I got a minigun when I was 9!
Lucky he was not level 13 otherwise it would be the same outcome
Im a spanish BUT ONLY SHIT THIS IS AWESOME
Reminds when in Cyberpunk 2077 Panam Palmer gave me that OP fucking sniper. Literally one-taps anything. I didn't need to buy another sniper for the entire game.
Yes
I got mad when I couldn’t keep the Jagged Crown in Skyrim, it looks sooooo good and perfectly matched the armour I was wearing
They always give you a good gun but never enough ammo learned that from resident evil 4
Have a great day everyone
Pretty much the same thing when you beat the game and then go to the next playthrough and they didn't off the difficulty
0:33  *Plot Twist* It was the knife that was talking all along.
lol
I remember the most awesome one from GTA on the PSX, you steal a firetruck and the mission replaces the extinguisher with a flame thrower,the flame thrower back then was also considered certain death so imagine the fun of driving by pedestrians
I really f****** hate it when it just uses up a slot in your inventory and you can't sell it.
The mugger didn't have his shivving liscense, so his murder is 100% justified
Damn, this video reminds me of some actors taking home of there props or costume.
*I can confirm that his father is a psychopath, and he was the joker.*
FAKE!!! Everyone knows the story weapon becomes shit after you finish the story mission.   Jk great vid.
Killer Queen has already touched that bazooka
farcry 5 be like:
Half expected it to not work in any other situation

Weird how you can't keep someone's virginity even after you take it
To paraphrase the late great Eli Wallach “When you’re going to stab, stab don’t talk”
Fallout 4 fat man😈😈😈
Hehe nice
This is so relatable in the Spider-Man miles morales except it’s not a weapon it’s an special electrical attack and invisibility he does with his body
Remember for close quarters engagements while holding a rocket launcher face the back end of it towards you target and fire this is called back blast it's designed to keep the person firing a rocket launcher from flying ten feet back by pushing enough energy to shoot them 10 feet forward so if someone was infront of the back blast there health is probably isn't gonna be good for long
The scream at the end was one of Circle's best. Absolutely incredible.
"Guardian Down!"
Rick and Morty in a nutshell
i think its even worse when the story items are useless and just wasting space in your limited inventory but youre scared to throw them away because u might need them again later in the story
I actually just notice he doesn’t record his hand puppeteering the drawing anymore  wow such technology
That last bit is kinda how fights in Yakuza: Like a Dragon go
Lol
If only he had an acog scope for his knife, that was his first mistake
This is true cough# cough# borderlands but the weapons are shit
Talking about terrorism just hours before 9/11. You truly don't bow down to youtube's algorithm!!!
Then an hour later you scrap it cause you found a rocket launcher with better stats.
Quest weapon during mission:Doom BFG Quest weapon after mission: Netflix adaptation BFG
Dude! There's a glitch in Far Cry 4 with the melee kill option where you pull the pistol of the guy you just stabbed. If you die with the guys pistol in hand you respawn still holding it and it works just like the melee kill as a one shot kill on any enemy in front of you, except you can carry it around, reload and keep firing! So much fun
Holy s*** everybody get down that butter knife is fully loaded!
Example: The smart pistol in titanfall 2
"You've gotta be level 12 to do this kind of shit baby"😂😂😂
But then the item turns out to be weaker than the loot you find in the same story.
That dude had some serious skills with the knife
This is me using the Mortal Blade in Sekiro.
Relatable.
Every video of yours is gold
Had this happen in an old game called Draken. I completed the quest and the item was some really crazy gauntlets I think. I remember the quest glitched and when I "gave it back" it didnt remove it from my inventory. Rest of the playthrough was a breeze
I listened to the last explosion five times and I still don't know if there's an overlayed fart
DO.WE..GOT...A..PROBLEM?!   if you get it, you get it.
I love most everything this channel puts out, but this one was exceptionally funny
*Skyrim*
Thing is that you don't turn in the quest
Those finger animations when the guy was tricking with the knife were sweet af!
Sadly. His dad was a psychopath
The RPG then proceeds to do like 5 damage because it's a story item
Punk should have learned their place when the see an rpg sticking out the back of a guys back
How did you like Psychonauts 2?
This is what happened in Half life 2 with cournal cubbage
You got admit though that mugger’s finger work was god like with that knife.
rpg go brrrr
Imagine mugging someone and they suddenly pull out an RPG from their pocket
God the knifeplay was some next level shit. LOL
Dem nife scillz doh!
What game is this supposed to be because I want to have it
"You sure... committed terrorism back there." ROFL goddamnit...
This will be the last video I watch until I die to Judgement Day
Yes
sadly the guy had all the moves to impress before dying
Player: I mean, you are indeed very skilled with that knife.. TO BAD IT DOES SHIT AGAINST A FUCKING MISSILE *BOOOOOOOOM BABY*

Yuo*
oh god
The rocket launcher definitely gave him the advantage, but I'm surprised he wasn't intimidated by that mugger's pure skill
"This great sword was passed down through generations and is extremely valuable to me, but you need it more, hero"  *sells the sword instantly to save inventory space*
I never use strong weapons that have rare ammo, because what if I need it for the end boss? And then I beat the game without firing a single time
Those knife skills were on fire
I hate it when a game lets you keep a story item but makes it possible for you to lose it with no way to get it back. :( Looking at you, GTA: Chinatown Wars.
Hahaha the knife
Pickle.
usually for me the item  barley has any ammo or durability left after the mission
0:34 my friend when he bought a butterfly knife for himself
this video just didnt show in my notifications youtube is broken
It is pure joy to find your new uploads bro. Just pure joy
just like farcry 3
Truly amazing ✨
When you spend days unlocking game content, fighting bosses, influencing individuals, walking miles to unlock an area. You find an optional quest there and do it, and then  a random NPC from starting location casually shows up
Is that Resident Evil's rocket launcher?
So Jak 2 and 3
Oh c’mon man, he was just testing out his Winter Solider cosplay, just took it a step further with the knife tricks too.
Yes. Just yes
Nice
Ngl that knife do be schmovin
Trinston was here..
Resident Evil 4 Ganado: *Te voy hacer picadillo* Leon: (Pulls out infinite rocket launcher) *Where did everyone go Bingo*
Far cry?
Circle tried WAY too hard on the explosions.
''Excuse me, i would like some napalm, for... Huh... Killing weeds... In my lawn, as far as you know.''
Whenever I get an op story item, I always feel like I shouldn’t use it because everyone gets it.
Ever play a Yakuza side quest that gives you a weapon? Spoiler alert.
The voice acting with the knife movement is so good XD
Hi
Me when I find diamonds in minecraft
XD
This finna get you canceled
That moment you realize that RPGs are for destroying vehicles and tanks but you have been using it on infantry
When you put cheats in mission 1 in gta games
Ło
ok
Them knife skills he would never lose. Oops that guy has a quest item. Damn
Something about the scream at the end made it x1000 times funnier
the awkward moment you get the BBEG's gun that was used to murder 2,234 orphans and you have the moral dilemma not using it because itd be wrong or using it because the stats aint bad lmao (the stats always win)
And then they games that let you keep the story items but are 100% useless
he makes animations with click and drag..im speechless 🔥🔥🔥
The True Storm Ruler in Demon’s Souls that was absolute trash outside of that fight
I thought the quest will take the RPG, so to keep the RPG; he would never finish the quest.
omg I can't stop laughing at that scream at the end LMFAO!!!
Giovanni
Those knife tricks were really impressive, I would have gave him my wallet
Lel
I'm looking at you Zelda with your Bow of Light.  I wanted to keep it.
Mission complete  *obtained awesome spinning knife*
0:17 My favorite line in the world "Great job kiddo, you sure commited terrorism back there".
Or you can just never turn in the quest
What about games that don't let you keep the item. I never forgave Fable for not letting you keep the ultimate weapon they hyped up for longer than the 7 seconds the boss fight took with it.
man this is just fallout 4 in creative mode
roblox
you got limited ammo tho
Lol
Yo somebody call Gabe Newell because that knife play was sick
Pretty much me playing games
Its really funny to kill grunts with a roket launcher
Anything for family
"You got be LvL 12 to do this kinda shit baby" 🤣💀😂
This happened in bl3 skag dog days for sure
I still remember keeping that tiger taxi from GTA Vice City in my garage even though its driver being only eliminated by exploding it yet I still managed to get it after many hours.
Me: Are you taking this back? Game:.... Me: :)

"This is a priceless family heirloom that my family has spilled blood over for countless generations. This heirloom has seen not only wars and genocides alike, but human atrocities that make the most hardened of psychopaths weep, and you're asking me to just give it to you?"  "Yes"  "Sure here you go"
Nice
Ouch
Too bad I’m level 13.
This made my day. COVID isn’t great, but videos like these get me through it.
Pure gold😂
Uhh yeah, Passing the Whole Terrorist thing, $27 for Blowing something up?! That’s a Rip Off.
@CircleToonsHD what art program do you use? It looks like Paint but I don't remember what year. Loved the video!
sick knife moves bro
0:21 DOM TORRETO!?
My man destroyed his whole family tree with that rocket.
Her before this video is 1 day old love the video
Me with the overpowered sniper you get in Cyberpunk 2077, lol
That muggers knife work was on another level
"You have to be level 12 do do this shit BABY !"   - famous last words
That guys knife handling is NUTS!
I am only level 10, so that was indeed scary. Thanks for saving me, adventurer.
Great sound effects on the RPG by the way.
ah classic american
Guess the ammo must be scarce
That's vegas baby
my man looking like Danny DeVito
Your animating skills are still suprising.... Ly..... Beautiful.  Brilliant😂👌
I was sure you were gonna sell it the moment the mission ended
Me : So you're telling me that your great great great grandfather has passed this magic crystal jewel down each subsequent oldest child for generations?  NPC : Yep  Me : And because of this it's a priceless family heirloom that holds more importance to your father than anything?  NPC : Yep  Me : And despite all of this history, you're ready to just hand it to me, a complete stranger, to help save the world, just because I, a complete stranger, told you I would  NPC : Well that and the fact you killed those two orcs who were blocking the path for the casing of the gem  Me : So anybody capable of slaying two lvl 3 enemies can just lie to you on a bad day and steal you family's greatest treasure  NPC : ... well at least I'm can say I tried to help you save the world  Me : Homie I'm gonna use this for two areas at most and replace it the second a stronger crystal shows up  NPC : ...  NPC : ... I've neve been the smartest guardian of heirlooms ok
yes
reminds me of a certain game       perhaps far cry 3
Sweet
He waited his whole life to amaze you with those knife skills...
Prison is, essentially, server admins telling people to not use USAS-12 or shotguns in general.
He actually could cry in agony after getting shot
Rip level 12 mugger.  He just wanted to show off
reminds me of gta vice city
"You gotta be level 12 to this kinda shit baby" said every throwaway henchmen ever.
I keep every story weapon in Dying Light like Tahirs sword or just a gray machete i get in missions
That's not a knife... that's a- ... hold on... eh! Screw it...  *RPG launching bang*
Comment:  Why do people put edit
Most OP gun in borderlands 2 that have life leech effect is a quest item lol.  Of course nobody complete that quest. Everyone and their cat uses it...  XD
Fallout in a nutshell
Close fight
Ah, I see you're a fan of Indiana Jones too.
hello skedadudlers
Anyone who used an RPG in game would know, your own RPG shots are a bigger threat to you than they are to your enemy.
they always have only one bullet left though
I loved the ending, that's especially why you don't bring another knife to a knife fight.
That mugger looks like a guy who would poop in the shower.
Better than the games which gives you an awesome weapon, but only at the very end of the game. So you only get to use it for like 20 min or so before the boss is killed.
the cost of that rpg is about $2000. It would have cost  you less just to give him the wallet then to waste the ammo
Protip: don’t launch a grenade to someone standing right in front of you
Me with the king ring in FF15 xD
Can’t believe you reused the explosion, just pure laziness to save time. How fall you’ve fallen.
if this was COD the mugger would have won and after being shot twice!
Still got my Skeleton Key in Skyrim. never giving it back
Did he just animate the knife part??!!? OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOUR
GTA is such a great game
Those knife tricks were almost as wicked as that skeleton's skateboard tricks.
Just like Shishkebab in Fallout 4
My dumbass holding on to the grognozzle from bl2 dragon keep, because the game WONT let me keep it after the mission.
Boop
That's fine and cute until the game have a weight system and you cant drop the item :(
Check out those knife moveeesss
*Meet the Soldier*
Was that you screaming at the end? That was pro!
that's the good version of this happening. the other possibility is they let you keep it, but "surprise" the quest you just did damaged the weapon so it get's downgraded to "acceptable" levels.
those knife trick skills tho!!
Level 12 looks pretty dope ngl
When you get arrested and all items are confiscated. Story item: Cannot be removed from inventory. Me: oh GUAaaaaaarrrrrrdds~
This was majestic.
fake, i horde everything considered "big boy weapons" in case i need them later, regardless of the sheer amount of ammo for said weapon i am given
Thanks for the laugh :)
Lmao
Never bring a knife to a gun fight.
Oh yeah. Totally did shit like that.
Probably the best thing ever
Nie etwas noch unlustigeres gesehen. Und film es mal ruhig und nich so rumzappelnd meine gühte da bekommt man augenkrebs
If I ever mug somebody that's absolutely what I'm going to say haha
B O O M
Just Cause 3
I've done all the Vampire DLC main quest in Skyrim yet I'm still stuck with these huge, heavy, and useless Elder Scrolls in my inventory.
i remember there was a misson in kingdom come deliverance, where you had to catch a knight as he was running away on a horse. When I make him surrender he dropped his weapon, then there was a cutscene and then he just walked away leaving his stuff behind. I was like " are you gonna take them or..." anyway they were better than mine so I took it.
Plot twist: its the knife, who was speaking.
Farcry 5 in a nutshell
He was standing pretty close Did he died in explosion too ? :D
Also, it’s still listed as key item. So happy trails with it literally chained and welded to your backpack
Sometimes I just never finish quests if the quest item is cool enough
Should've never brought a knife to a rocket launcher fight.
"You sure committed terrorism back there." That line got me.
Thing is, when you get that unique story item, every enemy seem to have the same item equipped also 😅
That guy had insane knife skills
yes
The mugger: "What's the matter, you ever been mugged before?'  Him: _I'm about to end this man's whole career_
This is how my first play through of Fo4 felt, I found a rocket launcher and some ammo early on and I breezed through the game.
Your style and voice acting sure has Improved over the years
Oh my gosh that's exactly how the story driven games always reward you with those very powerful weapons or items that after beating the game you really just don't know what to do with them 🤷‍♀️ except go back on a boss level and test out the weapon on an big boss or a small boss and well... that's about practically it but I guess after all it is rewarding to earn it though you just don't know what to do with it after the journey and story is over eh💁‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤣
Damn they better nerf it in the next update
This game let's me live my wildest dreams which is terrorism    Oh wait I already lived that
never bring a knife in a RPG launcher fight
the scream
This is just the song to go ballistic on You just pulled a *knife* on the guy with the missile launcher
The knife he picked up from this guy had better stats
No one talking about those sweet knife skills
I'd be scared too if a guy was able to twirl a knife in his hands with no fingers
I’m surprised that CircleToons hasn’t made a video about hames where treasure hunters go half way across the world, commit mass genocide, and fight gods only to just let the treasure go because “family and friends”
Too bad all the other kept mission items are taking up all the inventory space
Fallout New Vegas be like
I feel that
The sniper slingshot and spudgun of bully come to mind. Rockstar know how to please their customers
9/10/21.
knowing the gamer playerbase only 1% of it would be worried storylinewise to return such a item.... everyone is a fucking raider/thief and gives no shit to anyones family.
Love it when you get a cool looking story item that's immediately outclassed by an item you find around the next corner
tho it's gonna a skyrim thing, where ure forced to carry a useless item till the end of the game using inventory space :P
Alternatively, start then abandon a mission right away for infinite rocket launchers
I thought it was about how you can never throw away the story item when it becomes obsolete so it has to waste a space in yoir storage
Gotta love far cry games for doing that
0:34 Lol Powerpuff Girls physics.
Heh, nice. I actually chuckled at the knife part.
No body is born cool, except...👋 "Developers who allow gamers to keep an awesome weapon after a mission" 😏
0:29 Literally same energy as the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when Indiana Jones shoots the guy with the sword and ends it right there.
Fucking awesome
Games hardly let you keep the cool items but sometimes force you to hold onto a statue piece the size of a large dog in your backpack forever
Fallout 3 when you get to keep the Fat Man after killing the giant super mutant while saving Sarah Lions and her squad early on in the game.
Nothing beats an RPG and family
Ha! Jokes on you, at that minimal distance the rocket would have a safety trigger to not explode! The knife guy should have won... Well if he can catch the rpg.
Muggings in turkey be like.
Dorderlands 2's grog nozzle is the oposite of this :( one of the best guns in the game and its mission locker :(
I love the rapid stabs
5 minutes latter, the rocket launcher can’t even kill an ant because the level scales too fast
The developers who code the game to allow their players to keep story items probably have some of the biggest hearts in the industry
GTA: *Relateable*
Too accurate
Far Cry 5 be like: yeah, you can have my amazing 'Murica truck with heavy artillery that I love so much and my son that somehow survived a civil war on Indian something that I think I don't hate
The person with the knife is definitely a noob. A professional would easily be able to deflect the rocket.
Reminds me of the spray paint mission in GTA SA. After the mission, I had so much fun spraying random people and seeing them cough until they die. Good times.
The knifeflipping was relatable.
But that Stabby Stabberton was awesome you gotta admit!
The knife thing was pretty impressive. Even moreso considering he did it without fingers.
That's pretty powerful, using an RPG in an RPG
Dark Soul 3 Stormruler. An absolute menace to tall people and giants in general. Its straight up bullying with how powerful that beast of a mighty weapon is as it summons the power of winds to fell the greatest beings.   Its a wet fart against everything else in the game.
This is pretty much gta 5 in a nutshell
Best weapon ever
It is satisfying to blow up thugs though.
He flips that knife so quick, you can't even see the fingers.
story item = :)
Me at the start of RE2 blasting everything that moves with the infinite ammo AT4
Hmm, by the name of the channel you’d think everything he draws would be a circle.. the opposite of Minecraft..
Ever get to keep a mission item, but it's like 5 or 10 levels weaker than whatever you already have
It has no knock back i see
No kill like overkill
It fells like the bfg in doom
That scream killed me
nah then it does horrible damage
058y4 vum.fyi
BOOM
I legit love it when you get to keep story items.
Alternative plot: When the game makes you store the useless story item in the main inventory. And now your inventory is full of random useless sht that can't be used in combat
Noice!
"Ohhh what's this?! Have you ever been mugged before?!?!"  *Player takes out RPG*  "... I want to apologize."
then about five minutes later you run out of the really rare ammo it uses and never use it again
Dat scream tho
nice ,like always
Holly s.it that explosion was sick
My lovebird was in my mobile phone and choose to watch this video. So this channel has a parrot seal of approval.
Ah, ya see the problem here is that the Thug wasted his surprise round on earning Style points. Classic mid level knife specialist mistake.
The good old hide my weapons in my ass technique.
never bring a knife to an RPG fight
What level was the first guy
I mean usually the npc will say something like “and why don’t you keep the rocket”  Or something to that effect. But regardless, that singular enemy that needs to try shit with me after usually learns a valuable lesson in not testing my patience.
kinda reminds me when i kept the skeleton key in skyrim for a very long time before completing the mission and abusing it
Plot twist: that was the only ammo you get in the game.
gta san Andreas vibes intensified
I know my stream schedule is stupid and dumb, but I'd love if you followed my Twitch so you can be first to know when I stream <3 Might stream today/this weekend https://www.twitch.tv/circletoonshd
More typically, the old quest items clog up the inventory and overburden my character. And can't be sold, dropped or recycled, of course. In the case of a ranged weapon, there won't be any ammo available for it anywhere, either.
Those knife tricks are the reason he has "HD" in his name
0:30-0:41 when the spy tries to butterknife the soldier in TF2.
I just love the violance in the end, the scream was perfect.
I thought it was going to be like "random twig - Story Item" and having the existentiall dread of trying to find whoever the fuck it is that wants this stick...   Can't say I'm dissapointed with this though, great video!
Every single upload of yours surprises me with how great it is.
That knife looked like it was coming out of a tenga.
"Lvl 5 RPG kaboom lvl 12 knife skills" - The Beast of War, 1988
Who needs a gun or a knife if you have a RPG
All fun and games until the mugger opens a uhaul and points a nuke at you
Finally now i can do some war crimes!
that robber got outplayed, shouldn’t have brought a knife to a rocket-propelled-grenade fight
its not accurate that mission must be a side quest and when you finish side quest you lose that weapon too cuz of that you start the side quest and you get rpg but you don't complete the mission so rpg stays with you thats the real thing
That guy is now a certified soldier main
RIP the man with the knife
Is is just weird that I burst out of laughter hearing that robber goes "arrrrrrrr" after being hit by a rpg
Finnaly.. New video.. Ive been sleeping in 1 am since last week, its time to rest..
This is why us brits don't go to America
Don't bring a knife to a rocket launcher fight
perfectly cut scream be like 0:40
This is good, imagine him going to space with that thing earning 27 B per alien kill.
0:28 the Krauser boss fight in re4 in a nutshell
It's either this or now the rocket launcher fires a mildly explosive finger that pokes him then disappears in a stock fart noise
Did you see those movements with the knife and that animation of the hands. WOW that was Amazing XD
0:33 I can't believe he's not surprised with those knife skills He's not even useing his fingers he just has a nub
I love that explosion drawing!!
E
0:40 That's the exact explanation of OVERKILL.
"You sure committed terrorism there, here's 27 bucks"
GTA Cheats activated
The final scream is just..... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!! ( H3NtAI moan)
I am only one comment among thousands of others who will soon drown in the endless void that is the comment section
Rip level 12 bandit Still, he was no match for that level 50 bazooka...
Never bring a sidequest to a main story item
Too be fair, those knife movements were pretty intense. Clearly the rocket launcher was the only answer in that situation.
when you get a Legendary weapon at Lv 4
0:39 How I argue with people
Lmao
Mugger: **spins knife** You gotta be level 12 to do this! Circletoons: **pulls out rpg** Why do that when I can do this at level 1?
Y is it so accurate
The hands of the almighty sunflower item
I guess it really 'blew' him away.
peepee poopoo check ??
Inaccurate.  You blow yourself up along with the mugger and then lose all your stuff.
lol 😂
And then there's quest items in skyrim...
Now imagine if you had to find ammo for it
$27 for terrorism?  Sounds better than retail.
You should create one where you accept the quests and get an overpowered weapon but don't turn in the quest to keep it.
Funny and amazing as always, Great job!
Ah my day is now better.
The relation to gta story mode is uncanny
But a person giving a 7 year old a rpg isnt considered a psychopath
when you play skyrim
Mugger: oh you have to be lvl 12 to do THIS kind of shit! So give me your money and I'll let you Liv- Me: *fires the RPG I just got from the previous mission* 🤣 I just love it when Games give us OP items Littearly early as hell especially if it's a story mission weapon 😂🤣
Everybody dancin till its the only item you need to pay for ammo to use
I've never seen animation as good as the knife fighting scene lmao
Can’t wait for future games to have stuff like that on the GameCube 2 being released this year
I love these
Gta in a nutshell
This is exactly like that one scene in Indiana Jones where he just shoots the guy doing all the tricks and stuff lmao
Man those last 12 seconds got the hugest laugh out of me. Great stuff man😂😂😂
0:34 - 0:38 Jeez I wish i one be able to do similar thrics with knife
Something something something Afghanistan.
ahhh, there are no human problems a nice rocket launcher can't solve...
He was lucky to have an rpg against a man with at least lvl 12 knife skills anything else and he would have been done for
This
Ah! Good old RPG. It never gets old
Now I'm thinking of using an RPG in an RPG to blow up a level 1 slime
I can keep this but I can't drop it BECAUSE ITS STILL CONSIDERED A QUEST ITEMMM
Hi guys
“You have to be level twelve to do this kind of shot baby!!!”whilst making the knife float across his nub hands
This feels like just cause 3 when you do a race mission in which you drive the formula 1 car and then after just keep that shit XD
Whats funny is that i just got off from playing far cry 3 which was free on uplay and i just got a shotgun for a hunting quest and got to keep it, then i proceeded to destroy a nearby pirate camp.
Knife flippers around the world are floored
0:33 his knife skills are truly astonishing, I didn't even see his fingers move
The story item either has a super-cool design and is really useful, or the most common situation, it has a super-cool design and is immediately outclassed by your other upgraded items.
You thought I was gana say second but it was me DIO!!!!
I want expecting the video to end there but it was perfect lmfaoooooooooo
Man, those knife moves are lit!!
Play undertale
When the story item is one of the most powerful weapons in the game.
"What's a matter bitch? You never been mugged before!?"
*yes, I like using heavily explosive anti personnel weapons on thugs*
Epic
The knife animation without fingers was too good 😂
0:33 this is some high quality knife tricks.
epic
dad!! i have rpg
And the item is either great and you'll use it a ton, or it's shit and you use it once.
You talkin’ mad shit for someone in rpg distance
I too would be scared of a man that has no fingers that could flip a knife around at fast speeds
As they say, never brink a knife to a RPG fight
Press(x) For TRUE
oof
Poor timmy , he just wanted to show off his knife skills 😞
It either does that or it just keeps it in your inventory and can never be used again
The story item is too powerful
Those knife skills were pretty legendary though. Surprised he didn't win  EDIT: (thanks for the positivity everyone! You all have a wonderful day!)
Always take a RPG to a knife fight
And They Give, Out Amazing Or Expensive/Exclusive Items Too
I never really realized how much your art and coloring has genuinely improved over the years
This feels very similar to forza
Ok so now the sequel where the guy survived the RPG blast and it's something like, "RPG damage in an RPG"
Man just solved the UK children carrying knives crisis
RPG cheese, the best kind of cheese
just restart the game and you'll see it's a bug
The true monado in ng+ plus in s nutshell
When you get a story item at a low level end up selling it then at end game finding out it’s actually one of the best weapons in the game and you can only get it once
To be real tho, those were some cool knife tricks
Little did you know that knife was the best weapon in the game
Potato
Why does it say 2 comments
too bad it was a level 13 rocket launcher
That ending though it was beautiful
The glory
"Dont bring a knife to a Weapon of mass destruction battle"
Lmao this is good
I do hate it when you're stuck with a quest item after the quest is over. I mean like they keep it in your inventory and you can't ever remove it. like a key or some type of stone or something. Like baby the quest is over, I'm not obligated to keep this in my inventory and yet you force me to not ever get rid of it.
69th comment 👌🏽
Commit warcrimes and terrorism for only 27 dollars
Damn he really wanna shank me
0:34 *YO HE GOIN’ SICKO MODE*
yes
Lol
The Swiss army knife animations there 🥵 🤣
It just works.
Hi from Brazil
Here's 27 bucks   Bro what a steal
Impossible
Sick knife tricks
What about when you DON'T actually want the item? Basically every glitches quest item in Skyrim
Perfectly cut scream at the end
When the game gives you a rare item and lets you keep it
Hello
