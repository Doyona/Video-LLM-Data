lol cant take it on a plane sell it worldwide lol
If you cant take it on the plane, then you just buy it at your destination, sales!! sales!! , once you get the marketing and distribution right.
Kelly is grumpy miserable women
2025 update: company got acquired by Likewize and Oliver remained managing director up until July 2025. Congratulations to Oliver!!
HE IS WELL OFF WITH CRUELLA De VILLE, SHE IS SMART, AND DOES NOT GET EXCITED ABOUT 99% OF THE PRODUCTS WE SEE.
I feel like a job offer would have been even better
I'm sure that kiss on both cheeks still resonates with Oliver.
Even when she is interested in something, Kelly just sounds like she is bored out of her mind with her monotone delivery 😂
Kelly is a soulless demon
..... polite... wearing suit ... very well groomed....didnt say LIKE ...perfect !!
A bag of rice does the same job! 🤷‍♂️
Mobile Handset, wild!
Kelly: “I’m really upset about that” with all the emotion of someone who hasn’t left the couch in days
Jenny phoned in to say that she was taking Peter’s advice, so she’s out.
Handsome, smart young man.
Does anyone realise that this gorgeous boy mentions i-pods thus must by now be a hopefully wealthy middle-aged man with children & grandchildren?!
all these years later and phones are now water proof
Kelly has -10 charisma
Most phones now , are waterproof
I was convinced peter was going to make a offer when he said that but noooo
He's hot
Too bad, might need to work off a couple of points with Kelly over a couple ot late nights.
where can i buy this item today? or
Kinda messed up for Peter to tell the other dragons to drop out so he could have it, only to drop out himself. Dude makes more than £50K per episode just to sit there; even if the proposed business isn’t all there yet, he could def afford to take a long shot every now and then.
"cant buy it at an airport before you fly"... how about you buy it when you land how that woman is on dragons den or successful
its when he said in his mums utility room with gloves on that he lost them.
ever heard of a $2 bag of rice?
Practise what you pitch!
Basically a bag full of 99% ipa and a bag full of silica gel.
Once again the thieves (vultures) are circling the prey. When is an investment an investment? I am not sure about that. But I do know a bunch of "legal" thieves when I see them.
4:10 - the only flaw is her limited reasoning here. The goal would be to get this product in every airport terminal in all popular holiday destinations.
Kelly Hoppen's nose is MASSIVE
I lost a track of how many phones I broke. Since I started using shockproof and waterproof phones, it has been only 3 losses in the last 5 years. Easier to keep a track.
Bit naughty of Peter to suggest he was interested and therefore wanted everyone else to drop out, only then to drop out himself.
Nice product, but nowadays most phones are waterproof to some extent with some people opting for accident insurance. Pretty limited market in 2023 imo.
Is this product even relevant anymore considering that phones are waterproof now?
What happened with PJ first wanting to dive head in and then he became super sceptical.
Aunt Kelly took good care of that handsome young man.
Lmao Peter said he was gonna negotiate then heard all the other dragons rip it apart and backed out 😂, don’t blame him though. Glad the lad is doing great with his business now.
This is such a punt, can't believe they didn't drop in some money for a high return
we never saw it working, people use rice same thing
Peter sucks
Garbage, most phones 5 years or newer can be put in water for a certain length of time and be fine
I think this is the first time I've ever seen her invest in something. Like even less often than Jenny if I'm being completely honest. Must have been his charm
Bag of rice costs about 30 pence 😂
25% for 50k seems steep. I think he definitely is young enough and smart enough to make it on his own. Selling a quarter of his business just for accelerated growth... When most chains have their own buying dept, you don't even need doors opening.
They should sell them at airports for new arrivals to buy, not for those departing.
WOW she's made an offer
Peter Jones should have said the product is competitive and can be added to smartphones at the store level
Peter go home and do it himself and keep 100%
I'm confused, why couldn't you buy this at an airport?  Obviously not because its liquid because you'd be buying it after security just like you would a bottle of water or alcohol.  is it because its flammable?  You can take a disposable or zippo lighter in your hand baggage and alcohol is also flammable.
Deborah greeden
Now she has a chance to sell the product in the next destination.
You may not be able to take it on a plane, but you could buy it at your destination.
Peter jones wants all Dragons to be out so he can invest!  Peter Jones:  Im out
But phones are now water proof ?
Put it in rice, muppets
She fancied him and wants a bit of after show nookie.
And nowadays phones are ip68 😭
12:19awkwardness
What's with the title ...Peter dropped out
This guy seems like a great guy and entrepreneur. Although the product doesn’t seem very useful now with most modern phones being water proof up to a certain depth.
11:23  If someone asks this question to Indian Sharks they would go berserk with their ego crumbling.
peter jones is thinking i can legally do this myself.
kelly hoppens nose wa wa we wa!  it's enormous!
Kelly rose in my mind
Buy it on the airside
No way he owns WeFix now after brand change of name. They partner with Samsung and come to your door to fix it! That's nuts!!
Kenya biggest Dragon 🐲
Horrible creatures are angel investors...   Avoid at all costs   *Mavis*
Peter: I want all dragons out so I can invest Dragons: we are out Peter: Gotchaa im also out
isnt it the same fluid used to repair computers
Quackery
kelly is always on  shopping channels and i see this product being demonstrated and sold on a tech hour show
First time I've ever seen Kelly make an offer that was accepted lol
Peares Linney should just declare himself out before hearing the pitches😄😄😄 Get it over with.
I dont get it. Even the cheapest phones today are waterproof?
God watching this compared to shark tank. Dragons Den is so dry but I still love it tho
Kelly, if that product becomes global, you can just buy it at the airport you're arriving at.
Great idea 💡🤠 from a fluid to another fluid recipe (interesting idea 💡) . Hopefully it works for this young man .
If I want to be free, I should not be intimidated, but once you are, then it is part of the job description.
sad that this type of buisness will become void soon enough when all phones become water proof
He was so impressive. If they had young capable people like this on the Apprentice, it would be more of an interesting business show.
Well done Peter, I noticed the name has been changed to WeFix but is excellent, that's fab!!
I’VE BOUGHT A SECOND CAR… just in case my other car stops working!!!! 😐🤦🏻‍♂️
This was lovely
Total shocker! " I really wanted Peter Jones".  I hope Kelly backed out when she saw this.
no one asked about waterproofing or cloud, shows how good the future is
But most phones are waterproof
This song is absolutely perfect !!!
I need this... 👍👍👍
Kelly is a star. She went to jail in South Africa for breaking the apartid laws, she was a musician.
If I had to rank my top 5 people I would least like to be sat next to at a dinner party I think Kelly Hoppen gets a spot in there
iPhones are waterproof this is 2022. Not 2000’s lol
For some reason, despite the trepidations on its fairly easy duplication,  the dragons, especially Peter, know that right before them stands the beginnings of a truly explosive idea. The one that got away.
Disappointed from Peter Jones and shows never ending trust, glad to see the good win for Kelly on success of this product
Exciting business partners
Peter the man love him a top man and dad
useless product, al phones are waterproof now, its just a gimmick
Glad the young entrepreneur got investment 👍
Peter Jones do know one or two things about mobile 📱 phones 🤤
Computers winning sales at least 5-1 , not one penny more
How much money does P.J actually want ? GREED driven B's the lot of them.
So this was 2013 . Last I Found was that the Business was successful it became a company called WeFix a mobile repair service he bought our Kelly's shares And got a 5 figure investment in 2017
guy made his millions until all phones are water resistant up to 30-60 meters now lol
What is P1G? A Devil ba5tard.
It's not early stage. I think he has ideas wasn't fully mapped out to crush competition. He instead off he I informed about product creative possiblity. He should needs to know how to understand packaging
This recording is not recent at all
Piers is so boring with his approach. Could fall asleep listening to him 😂
Kelly must have been his last choice of dragon, though.
OMG!!! Here it is!!! I’ve found it!!! The ONE deal where Kelly Hoppen actually MAKES AN OFFER?!?! 😮😱🤯🤩
Kelly is quite tasty!
This is brilliant
Most smartphones now are water resistant
Far to many adverts
Even if it was the only offer in the Den, I just could never ever go with Kelly. Something really obnoxious about her. She doesn’t win much either.
That was a low percentage it should have been close to 40% for the amount of work that has to be put into that business
Kelly says after he receives her offer, "I think I now want to drop my s**t down the loo and see if it works!"
Kelly can still ride my monster ❤ 🚙
No one:  Duncan Bannatyne: IM OAT
She was very generous with the offer. She could have asked for 40%
Hello dragons🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🌊🌊🌊🌊
Deborah is copying Donald Trumps hairstyle
He's got his main investment from The FSE Group, which provides tailored funding solutions and support for ambitious and innovative small and medium enterprises. 2015 sales/turnover 250,000 pounds. Trivia - Kelly's only investment.
Praise God! Good on you, Ms Kelly!
Something about the pacing of this episode seemed like a GSCE drama performance where they couldn't really remember their lines
I've dropped several phones in water & dried them quickly. This is completely unnecessary. But great pitch & idea for the people that think this is needed.
BUNCH OF BS
I know I only have to show my kit a drop of water and its gone.  A very  very odd reaction frompetter and deborah etc  Kelly was spot on right .
i better get on with that idea quick then. lmfao
Expect the unexpected fit very well for this case 👏👏👏
What a sneaky thing to do on the part of Peter Sulky Jones; asking his fellow dragons to not make any birds only to turn down the young entrepreneur.
oliver so fine for what
Is this still a problem with the number of water resistant phones now?
WD40
I think this deal was fair to be honest. 50k and he giving only 25% of his business, kelly didnt ask for a whole lot, and he got a dragon that can actually open doors for him. I think he is lucky.
Stop spoiling the segment in titles
What a really nice lad. So much emphasis on bad news and the “younger generation” good luck mate I hope everything went well.
I see this product must o have in campers, boats summer places etc, But if its highly flammable i think it makes a hazard specially in boat. Boats run in diesel mostly bcs less flammable than gasoline.
*Breaking news* Oliver arrested for selling Crack. And smoking dope
He's a cutie🤗
Isopropyl alcohol is his magical solution 🤣 industry standard
So sadly the only thing they can buy into today is how greedy and cheap Peter is
he's cashed out and sold reviveaphone/WeFix company to Likewize last year.
I've watches evey episode ever made or aired,, like if you have too 👍
Probably the least enthusiastic offer and acceptance from a Dragon
Just checked this company out and he is still a director and the 2020 accounts show a £10.5 million turnover with nearly half a million profit. Even spotted Kelly's 25% allocation from 2013.
Peter soon change his tune
This is the first time I've watched a dragon's den video that wasn't uploaded a year ago
I wonder If Jenny’s strapping young lads would like this product
Shame it's useless now with phones being water and dust proof.
Kelly has a nose for investments.
Kind of sucks when you think you have an Ace in the beginning that says I'll wait for all of them to be out so we can negociate a deal.
He's awesome, what a pleasant young man 👍
Kelly has the most extraordinary nose.
My man from Ratatouille is exploring new avenues 👏
Kelly made an offer???!!!
Rubbish product, rubbish pitch. I'm out.
Yes indeed…The presenter Evan Davis is out…about time the others came out.
This was only one of two or three offers kelly ever made
Kelly is so posh it hurts 😂😂
I wonder how many projects the Dragons have stolen from these people.
The million dollar question is, did this product fit Jenny's product portfolio?
Unfortunately for Peter not all the other Dragons are Jenny
How to do a pitch in Dragon’s Den:  “Hello Capitalist Swine, I am here to get an investment of £50,000 in return for 20 % equity in my business which combines office space, cycling and textiles”.  *Camera quickly cuts to a shot of Touker’s bemused face*.
