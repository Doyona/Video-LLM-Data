25:37.. content ideas, something more calm.. can be “what we eat in a week”.. or “declutter with us”  or even a family mukbang.. remember there’s many of us who enjoy watching the chaos of real life as well as some love watching others eat!
Ep. 3 ✅️
Hi
Love itt❤
❤❤❤
Everytime I watch a dvd video I look for Sophie she is so funny and so cute and I'd love to see more videos of her she's adorable. Should do a day in a life of Sophie that would be brilliant. Love you guys so much this podcast is great. Can't wait for next week's videos!! Love you guyssss
Sarah you need to get the name 'Daniel' tatood on your hand aswell 😂😂😂
When you were saying hey siri or Alexa both mine went off 😂😂😂
Been here watching since I was 16 I’m 21 now(soon turning 22) never change or feel the need to impress! Keep being yourselves 😊
I agree with Sarah on the vale thing. My other half is the same and can’t live without it and even when we don’t have a lot of money he will till manage to buy a vape. P*sses me off
Sarah has such a business mindset and I think she has such a strong head on her shoulders, I am absolutely loving this podcast guys ❤️
I love your pod cast 😍
Fully set my Siri off 😂😂😂😂
Get Kaci or grace on the pod
Can you please do the Easter egg hunt, a big one like Brandon and Erin do yearly. Think that would be really fun, even do it dvd vs little piggots ❤
When are u guys going to get grace on here haha x
The vape bit killed me😂
Luv them Stay Puft chairs
Joel i feel ya i never smoked ever, had a vape on a nightout and been addicted since 🤣 tried to stop n i cant 🤣🤣🤣
I've been here from the start and I'm now 22 and still love your videos ❤
I love you I have watched you since like I was two I seen your first video and now I am 10 like i have watched all the kids grow up I love you all so much I wish you the best look❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I got 18 minutes in and it was mum talking, every time our Joel spoke she took over, and then she tells him to not act like a child, then gives him shit for not getting her water🤷🏼‍♂️
Me, a 25 year old mum, with my reminders on my fridge 🤓 how else am I gonna remember parents evening 😂😂😂
We need longer podcasts, go on give us some cheeky 2hr long ones😂
Love the podcast
Been watching since the very start and I still love your videos, it’s mad how much everyone has grown up❤️
I tried to get a couple of tears out 😂😂😂 hahah love you guys keep up the great work, we are all so here for it !!! ❤
This is my favourite podcast I look forward to this all week
Why no dvg video today
Love that you had to message to get the full arnswer 😂. Loving this pod cast
Loving this podcast!!! So interesting!! And also yes Sarah, keep on Joel with quitting the vaping! Especially if he has really bad asthma it’s soooo bad for that!!
It’s the fake tan mitt for decor 😂
Joel not washing his hands after using gradual tan moisturiser👀🤣
I’ve been watching for years and never usually comment but I am 25 now and watch you with my little girls now🥹they’re 3 and 1 and LOVE you and your girls, makes me feel not as weird still watching 🤣 xx
When they were both talking about how they are both good at apologising and joel said “yeah some more than others though” and looks outside the studio 😂
Live love laugh is a pod cast lol lad baby
I listened to this episode today while I had weekly run practice and enjoyed every second of it. This is what I needed. Thank you so much Joel and Sarah for Dad V Girls After Hours. ❤
Love the pod cast love the chloe and logan challenges
Thank you guys for enjoyable Podcast, and very educational as well XOXO
Sorry Joel but I have to say your hair is looking a bit ginger😂 are you trying to beat angry ginge
You should do dad v girls vlogs channel because I love those videos in comparison to challenges. I love all but definitely love the more chilled vlogs ❤️
My nephew was born 3 months early he only weighed 1 pound 10 hes now 12 and turning 13 this year and i cant totally understand with sophie he is exactly the same ❤ he has autisum also
Really love these!
I would love to do if u done another guess the child to the parent again i loved watching it
I loved this episode! My favourite one so far, also love how real they are about Joel vaping! X
i started watching at 8 now im almost 14!!
Absolutely obsessed with this pod I love how open it is ❤keep it up we love it
I never felt it more than when Sarah said “only 3/13 of us vaped” and Joel says “well it felt like everyone” 😅
I really like to hear/watch you talk about Sophie ❤ Its very interesting and it helps us as viewers to understand her more! I understand of course its probably hard to talk about, but I appreciate it 🫶🏻
i love you guys so much. but hearing joel vapes suprised  me. i hate vaping. and some of my friends do it. please just quit fully. its horrible. and addictive. honestly will always love you guys and not sending hate.
Love these podcasts. Addiction is so difficult, especially when you're in an environment that triggers it and you can't avoid it
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
really enjoyin this podcast❤❤
if you want to record things for the girls to watch back on youtube but not for everyone to see you could make it unlisted so yous keep the link and only people with the link can watch if
You turned my alxa on
i’ve been here since the first ever dvg video, and whatever you post will be such an enjoyable watch!
Loving the podcast 😊xx
As a mum seeing your day to day vlogs are nice to see. I am fairly new to the channel as discovered your family vlogs. You all seem lovely. Keep going you’ll think so something soon. But one thing from the video. So funny hearing it called WKD. Just called wicked here lol X
Usually I listen to podcasts while walking or at the gym but I have to watch this one on here definitely my favourite!!! ❤
Sarah hair looks so cute in this episode 💕
if i opened a des vu order and found a personal not from kaci i could literally cry!xx
i prayyyyy this doesn’t turn into faith & ethan’s growing paynes podcast where they just argue 24/7 🥲
I am almost seventeen and I love all the content you guys post!!!!! <3 <3 I have been watching for many years:)
LOVE reading all these comments.. THANK YOU so much ❤
I’m so happy you had a wonderful birthday! 🎂  You all seem to have so much fun with it as well. Sophie was so sweet about her birthday. I love that she wanted it filmed that is so neat for all of you guys to have. I see how the forgiveness is there from Sarah from Vaping but so proud of you that you have quit. It’s nothing to be ashamed of because so many do it but vaping now can be used with CBD! ( for medical purposes)
do you find that having businesses together strains ur relationship a bit?
I put it on my calender lol
I started watching you when I was 4
I will watch  any  video
I’ve been watching youse since 2019 and now I’m 16 and regarding the content stuff you were talking about, trust me fans who have been with u from the start are happy with any type of video, we love the vloggy vids coz as Sarah said we get to see more of what you guys are like. We never find youse boring don’t worry joel!!!
Episode 3 and this is already one of my favorite podcasts ❤
I’m 25 and I’ve watched every single one of your videos and still do! My favourite YouTubers
As a wife and mother of teenagers, I absolutely LOVE seeing you two chatting like this!. We forget who we are sometimes as parents! Love that you two make time for each other! I’m with you!! X
Not me sitting here vaping like a addict and feeling attacked😂😫
Not me sitting here vaping like a addict and feeling attacked😂😫
Not me sitting here vaping like a addict and feeling attacked😂😫
As one of the older subs that grew up with DVG (24) that's what I like about the channel most, I'm at an age where I'm thinking about children and love the content with the younger 3 but also love the more mature content with Kaci & Grace as it's relatable.
this is my favorite ever! i look forward to it every Tuesday! 🫶
I swear Joel is just a natural at this ❤ he talks so flowingly. And you two are so cute together haha x
Joel and sarah if youve ever watched "the goldbergs" youll understand more about the mother in law thing😂
Sooooo I added it to my calendar haha
i want coco on this podcast as a guest🥰id love to hear sarah and joel try have a adult conversation with her
Wait so does that mean in the video that grace hide a vape it was Joel’s… (Not to be rude !!) {tell me if I’m wrong !!}
More content with the older girls ❤
We all just love watching your family, it doesn’t matter what you do, you always cheer us up.  Especially Sarah’s laugh 😉🖤
I use to hate Tuesday but now I can't wait for them ❤
saw someone wearing a des vú puffer coat on the tram the other day x
Definitely you guys have watched The Therapy Crouch with Abby Clancy &  Peter Crouch lol, especially with the Dilemmas talk 😂👍
What farm???????
Loveeee the vlogs of your life!!! Its an insight to a lifestyle some of us will never be able to experiance, your family it so funny and amusing to watch! 🤍
I love everyone in your family iv watched you for many, Just being yourself is great ❤ I would love to meet you all ❤
Please do blind, deaf mute baking with you Sarah and grace x
Joel please can you put on a polo shirt for the next podcast please asap 😊
love this pod! video idea for dvg if you need it? - reacting to old vlogs / recreating old videos! :)
Im sure youve tried this- but a chart on a wall that shows pictures of whats coming up can really help- like a calender of the week or a day-to-day breakdown and flash cards. My son can be overwhelmed easily by heightened emotions and i noticed it helps him have the visual understanding as well as the verbal
I love u all sm and will watch any vid u do
Sarah and Joel😂 you two are just like me and my other half.   Do you do a visual timetable with Sophs? Im guessing you've probably tried it but it could help with the anticipation and knowing what the day consists of. If something comes up that isn’t on the timetable you could have an 'oops' card.  You can do this with pictures/ symbols/ photos or words just on a whiteboard or you can make a board.  You can also use a now/next/then board which can be portable.  A timetable doesnt work for every child, it's what works for her. ❤ I'm sure you both know all of this as you are so great with Sophie and know her best.   Give me a shout if you ever need any advice or support xxx
A good video would be something like what will they do like you did with chloe and logan but do it with chloe and maddie
I have a 7 week old baby and I am constantly thanking my partner/baby’s dad for being so hands on and helping out so much. He always gets so confused and says the same as Joel that he is just doing what a dad should do😂
I honestly love your vlogs, your challenges are interesting and especially funny when you have other guests in it but nothing beats your good old vlogs where you get to see you being a normal family
Low-key my Alexa woke up and did the blue circle haha
Got to love tuesdays for a podcast and wednesdays for a Dvg upload
1 like=1 push-up!!!
joel pls just fully quit it’s horrible
i started watching you guys when i was 10 (4 years ago) and i love seeing how everyone has grown and how the family have expanded and changed love you guys❤

Favourite days are Tuesday and Wednesday 💜🩵🩷
Love this pod sooooo much I usually don’t watch podcast but when u saw you made one I clicked on it straight away 😊 I love your pod and alll the channels ( Kaci, grace, family ect.) I look forward to Wednesdays and Tuesday just because of your vids ❤
I love this podcast and I would also love to see grace and Kaci on it when Kaci get back also hoping she is having fun ❤❤
Omg love this pod sooooooo much! Are you ever going to have any guests such as kaci and grace??? Love u sooooooooo much ❤❤❤

love your new podcast! And I was thinking you should film another match the child to the parent I really enjoyed that.
53:48 this bit got me creasing😂😂
Love this ❤
I've been watching since u first started YouTube and you guys are amazing I love you all time is flying by I love watching u all grow x
I started watching when i was 8 and I’ll be 15 this year, I couldn’t be happier to have grown up with a better YouTube family ❤
Thank you guys for enjoyable Podcast, and very educational as well ☺XOXO 💕
That’s why you’re my favourite YouTubers though Joel, because of the fact you are such a perfectionist, every video you have ever done is soooo good. Like I have other YouTubers I love that post daily or a lot more than once a week and I still enjoy it and so often I wish I could see more videos of you all each week but 1, it makes it more special. Every Wednesday I’m like yay DVG fam video tonight! But 2, I can always guarantee that whatever video you make, it’ll always be top quality content and I think that’s what makes you all stand out from so many other YouTubers. So I think it does pay off to be a perfectionist. Maybe not at the expense of you being overly stressed but you do a great job and you should all be really proud of your achievements. I’ve watched you since you started YouTube and never missed a single video and I also watch back my favourites sometimes (especially challenge videos!)
Love this pod 🎉❤
I have been watching DVG since I was 13 and am gonna be 18 in march 🥲🩷
So proud of you Joel ❤
MAKE A DVG IS THE BEST CHAINN
