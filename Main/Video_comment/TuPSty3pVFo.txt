katie my cousin had this good idea for a pov and i thought it would be cool to see u do it! u makr physical contact with someone (it can even be as little as brushing their arm) and a song plays abt what ur future is with them (like with ur bf it could play a breakup song and a random guy it plays some wedding bells) FULL CREDITS TO MY COUSIN THIS WAS HER IDEA NOT MINE ILY CUZ ❤❤
Why is everyone referencing Heathers/
Did she pick herself to go or did she stop herself in time?
part 3
Your a mean fucking person People can change
Is it just me or does no one else I’m their life think that emotions are temporary like everyone else. I guess what I’m getting at is life sucks sometimes so why make a big deal about it idk I guess that’s just what I think of when I think of petty revenge
"I'm not just getting my revenge, they're getting what they deserved"  Well judging how you got that choice that's pretty much revenge and not them really getting what they deserved, They learned nothing from it the only thing that happened was you got rid of em.  Not really getting what they deserved if they don't learn from it (not unless it was one of the coincidental deaths)  Remember that people even with this power it'd just be best to forgive and try your best to move on, They'll get what's coming eventually
Pt 3!!!
Are you in stranger things are u" Brenda"?
No worse your killing people
You r getting revenge your a terrible person your as worse as they are
I feel like she just chose the people she dosent like to go.-

Joey literally the only thing he did was not want to go to home coming with her so you kill him wtf
😛
she just chooses to KILL everyone? maybe they were raised in a dysfunctional family? and they did something minor, she's a murderer. and when someone else comes (not knowing it's her) she just kills them.
