Pure electric goosebumps when that beat hit at the end with the big reveal! What an epic frame and what a crazy journey this has been! Can’t wait to see it in person 🙌🙌🙌
I feel like your the personification of my humor
the frame ruined this entire process
10:33 bro really made poop holders for his pocket vag's
6:54 - id stick it in there.  that too i guess.
This dichoric plastic thing is amazing.
What did you line the wooden boards with when using the epoxy clay? Parchment?
5:42 Crooks and Nannies 😂😂😂
The power of their source..the crystal
This collab was my introduction to your channel and the amount of smiling and laughing these two videos brought me was astounding. Also the way you make your love for what you do shine through is inspiring! Wewd!
“Master procrastinator” plus “I hate waiting” truly sums up the dichotomy of the ADHD experience 😂😂
The ridiculous skits contrasted against the calm project narrative had me laughing like a freaking maniac. blah blah blah SMASH 😂
gtfr
The work you put into this thing is just impressive
All of the artists involved in making this one of a kind did a fantastic job!!!  You are all amazing!!  What a journey!!
Not me thinking he was literally gonna grow crystals 😭😶
The amount of work that you put into this project and the entire video is amazing. Seriously! This must have taken so much time and effort and I really appreciate watching someone work so hard on something they are so passionate about and so talented at! Thank you!
Bobby really has that adhd brain energy he said no..i want it MY WAY EXACTLY and proceeded to make each. Individual. Crystal. EXACTLY? im shaking in my boots
Brilliant ❤
Wow the final result is awesome!! Well done!
LOL something is wrong with you😂😂
I am loving this picture with  the crystals  congrats❤😮😅😮
A bucket load of talent makes you a crazy artist.
Looks Awesome
Not lazy. Its ADHD.
The fact that you made exactly (flawlessly) what was drawn is simply mind blowing. 20 out of 10 would recommend.
With over 4mill subscribers I can’t believe I’ve never seen you.  Like most brilliant artists,you are fu@&ing crazy but right on time. Thank you for sharing your sh!+!  I’m super inspired!
Whats the music you used at the end??
Me too😅 1:03
know one needs to be that smart hehe
Despite what some other people might say. I absolutely love the music choices.This guy puts in his videos.They're like relaxation and touch of msar with comedy throw-in. Good on you, B😎obby Duke Arts. 😎😎😎👍🤙👌🤘
I don't know how I came across this video but I had no idea that I needed to see a grown bearded man doing a hair flip and butt-shaking until I actually saw it. Yeah, I need this. Thank you.
2:50😂😂😂😂😂
6:47 absolutely insane reference
11:32-11:34 is the funniest part
Whats the name of the music when he's showcasing the final product?
Omy that was a lot of work does ur wife ever see u lol
0:00-0:30 was just the stupidest and funniest thing ever seen
Are you a fan of The Midnight Gospel? That “I love you” reminded me of the way Clancy says it in one of the episodes LMAO
Im stupid late, but your editing is god-tier. Im screaming over a prop foam tree (waiting on an order) and this has convinced me the art IS worth it.
I can’t fix myself from one thing 😢 story at five likes
Thats so awesome! Its so cool seeing some of my favorite youtube creators randomly making insanely sick stuck together! way to go
Came back here to rewatch this whole series. Bobby, it was already a masterpiece at the end of part one, but you found room for addition without making it cluttery. Back when I first watched you guys, I wasn't very artistic. Now you guys have inspired me to just start, and not think too much.
why is bro good at everything
I've never laughed so much, watching and artist be so funny! Loved watching this be made very cool art frame 😎🔮💜
Your perfectionism and attention to detail is absolutely amazing dude! Came out so rad
I really like that shirt and went to the online store to purchase it and it is under maintenance. It is not displayed in your YouTube store. How can I get the shirt you were wearing in this video? I really like your videos and want to support you making more.
Im in the middle of watching all your stuff again and i love it everyyime. Watching you create things that make me want to make shiz and i thank you for that, i couldn't really say anyone imspired me or made me want to create before but i can proudly say I have an inspiration and its you, thank you for giving me that. :> <3
Awesome now two years later and it seems like this type of creativity is scarcely seen now these days if possible can anyone let me know what this amazing retro song is at 2.36 would jam to this all day long amazing even though I'm two years late 😂😅
I love how you pronounce words! xD It gives me full on Megamind vibes too.
Love the content and creativity but the delivery is really irritating
Oh shi@, that looked way better than I thought it was going to and I thought it was going to look great.
What is the voice replicating at the very beginning? I had such a visceral reaction but can’t place why!
You’re an amazing and wonderfully crazy artist, love this so much !
It looks awesome. I would surely like to purchase the crystal cluster mold , if u could make one for sale . Can also keep it in ur shop plzzz
I subscribed less than 30 seconds into this video.
I just found you on YouTube and you a awesome. Never laughed so much in my life. I also love how talented you are
I've watched this video over and over. I LOVE this piece. Could say so many positive things about each step. Will make this comment instead:  6:40 - Bobby makes "adult toys"
Gotta love watching a crafting video and slowly hissing to yourself "oh he is a MADMAN" alone to yourself in your room
That looks amazing in the end. :)
Geezuz!  The editing on this video is amazing!  I love everything about this video.
Bet you were breathin out you ass after all those victory jumps.😆
Can’t fool me Bobby, I know a Dark Crystal shard when I see one 😂
It’s the first video I saw of this channel - IMMEDIATELY SUBSCRIBED !
Thank you for being yourself
Beautiful 😍🤩👏💪🤝🫶
Easy peazy 😳.    Nooootttttt 😂😂😂.      Fantastic work ❤❤❤
The volume difference between you talking and your music is super annoying
So much talent went into that. Beautiful work
When I first saw the thumbnail I thought the frame was attached to a monitor. I got so excited. Great job btw!
You can do it smeggalishous
Oh that makes sense. The molds in the cups had a lid that sealed them so they didn’t cure properly.
Wish i could like this video multiple times
This guy is absolutely insufferable. Talented, but insufferable. Heavy Theater Kid vibes. You don't ALWAYS have to be talking in some silly accent
"RAUGHHHH"  -bobby
Bobby Duke is a human anti-depressant! Thank you for being you!
Shake that butt
Hi
😎😎😎
Love that British butler accent
Can't wait to see your fursona
As im watching all videos in antichronological order I really appreciated the 'previously' recap. Time to go watch the first half
Holy crap that whole piece is insane. The frame is just, wow.
Dare I say Bobby’s frame may have been the best part of this colab. I hope he gets to do the frame for the other two 10 hun projects
I look at you with the most pathetic puppy dog eyes possible and say, MORE MERCH BOBBY!!! ….in a sweet way ☺️
I need to know the names of all of the songs used in this video. Please Tell Me.
The intro 💀
Love how this project is something that would describe how I want to decorate my home
If you're over here in Florida or over in Texas or Cali, PLEASE stay safe for us ❣️ Much love from America's penis 🌴✨
Bobby is basically Jazza, but with humor
That frame was so god damn impressive. The patience you must have! Absolutely mind blowing!
Your work and this video are amazing!! P.s. Your Helper has a rly sexy voice :D
Please trypophobio warning
Badass frame it'd be dope if you could use real crystals on your next one!!
Holy cow how cool im so happy I stumbled upon this video. I cant wait to see more videos.
fuq i love u dude <3
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I guess I can't argue with the overuse of accents due to your clear success but man... sometimes less is more xD  Absolutely gorgeous work
That frame is so amazing!!! Will the resin yellow over time?
I was as entertained as I was impressed. You are inspirational, sir.
Bobby, you’re freaking amazing. I have never seen a video of yours I didn’t love.  Amazing work as always!
He did it. He figured out how to create the crystals from the underground Hallow biome.
really love what you do Bobby, keep it going please :)
that's 15 minutes of my life I can't get back.
I saw a tutorial for this on 4chan way back in the day. I always had everything I needed in home, but never got to actually make some
just : WOW
I want this all over my room  or just make a room with is would be a dream come true
Wow the YouTube algorithm just spat this out, so late
Your neighbors HAVE to think you’re insane. 😂 Also-“How to stop eating batteries” in your search history?? Should we be concerned? 🤣
Does anyone know the song that played at the end with the final review  Edit: nvm I found it, it's called AGST - Flaw for anyone who's wondering
wewd
Bobby really makes me think of vsauce, lol They’re both slightly insane
4:48 - 4:58 *me for every possible project*
Honest question. Why not just 3d print the crystals? the way he did it seems much more expensive
Now THAT is a painting i could see sell for 100 million dollars and understand why.
This is very cool, but imagine this with a monitor, that would be so epic!!
wow that frame is amazing! i want it <3
I'd been wondering what I could use to cut facets. Polymer clay chips too much. I gotta try this.
You are the Stanley Kubrick of crystals
Bobby: *spends an age carefully turning a nail into a sword* Also Bobby: you might not know that I'm a hyper-perfectionist... It's ok dude I think we got it 😂❤
I like content like this, I don't know why. I guess it just feels satisfying.
3:56 how is that even possible.
2:49 hilarious. 8:55 also hilarious and this 9:01 is also hilarious. 10:45 you've twerked like 7 times in this video.
I love plate wall
More Bobby and peter
Trypophobia ass molds
That's a beautiful piece, but my god, you're annoying!
alr walter white
If I was rich I would buy that
Walter White did first
His wife and kids are saints. :)
I subscribing with pleasure  ❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
If someone told me that today I would see Bobby try to twerk, I would believe them. 🧐🧃🧐🥃
14:12 "I had no idea a frame would have taken so long to finish!" <--- Animation be like  Also amazing job! It looks epic!!
WOW 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Two words! A mazing!  You're a hoot, man! LOL  Thoroughly enjoyed these videos!
so sick!!!!
I feel like you had the hardest part of this amazing piece of art work. Lol. So entertaining!! Loved it!
i lost it at "crooks and nannies"
I've really gained an appreciation for sanding from watching your videos, i used to dread it, but not i actually think it's fun. Ty bobby for inspiring us and making amazing content and art!
2:51 best transition ever
Love it🙌👍And you are hilarious
I love your video's! You are so fun too watch. I am happy that i find you. 😊
HHHHIIIILLLLLAAAARRRRIIIIIOOOOUUUUSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love to be master in art so that we can make something together ❤
1:24 *”AND THE WAY I DID THAT IS”*
this is the definition of "Dad stop! your embarrassing me" 9:02
Bobby is my spirit animal
Procrastinators unite...some other time.
Are you selling this or have you already sold?
Thats wicked cool man you did so well on that frame
One of my personalities relates to you so much...
You should collaborate with Weston Lambert one day…yall would make a killer piece
You sound like papyrus
If you aren't keeping the epoxy blanks, I'll gladly take em 😶🙄 I wanna paint em
Just wondering how much it would worth after a century 🤯
That’s one of the best things I’ve ever seen someone make, seriously 👍
Beutiful
what is the song from 2:37?
So much work goes into the editing it's amazing really enjoy watching these videos
Wow! Wow wow wow
"cone that is sili" 😂
I relate so hard to how your brain works 😭😆
This is the most EPIC frame i have seen in my life!!
13:37 music name please 🙏
This is kinda deep, but lately I’ve been really down sad and what not, but it’s videos like these that just really put a smile on my face. Thanks so much for lighting up my day man, you’re videos are just what I need at this moment ❤
You’re my new favorite! Hilarious and brilliant artist! Wow!! This collab brought me here.
We need frames like this in the art community 😍
I love that frame
Stunning I love it thank you Sir
Is the one green plate on the wall made out of uranium glass?
I can’t help but to wonder a few things… One- is the shortness of breath related to resin use? Two- you were in the garage, where it could easily ventilate the chemicals from the resin and mold making process, why did you suddenly move to a less ventilated area when you needed the ventilation the most? Three- do you know the potential side effects to using resin and epoxy? I am only trying to make you aware so you can take the proper precautions and not end up sick from resin exposure. Please just look into it, for the people who love you.❤
WHY IS HE BREAKING STUFF
The quantity of work you put into projects is mind-boggling, and the results are incredible
this is criminally underrated, great work bobby!
One of the coolest things I have ever seen in my life, commission? Lol
2:50 and 8:56 10:46
He's going to make a million Cristals by hand? My Gahhd he's insane
that looks amazing!!!
Bro is mister maker but for adults
The only thing I can think is 'shiny'
I feel so bad I forgot daughter, Bobby Duke for a whole two years
You are indeed a perfectionist. And that video edit, it's next level. Amazing!
I was milking my turtle the other day while eating batteries. Luckily shipstation helps me mail turtle milk to all of my customers
This is the most incredible achievement. By everybody, of course -- it was remarkable to go back through all of the videos, everybody involved is so great -- but also just your part specifically; it can't be easy to come up with something that is both a total showstopper and still manages to enhance the painting instead of upstaging it. I don't know how you managed to walk that fine line, but you nailed it. I have a CRUSHING envy of whoever wound up lucky enough to give this piece a home.
Oh, the animation and .montage scenes are WEWDTASTIC! Seriously, Bobby, your channel has only gotten better over time, while still being you at your silliest. 💖💖💖💖
When he was making the crystals it reminded me of that one episode of the land before time when the triceratops, little foot, Peetree, and the other guys had to get similar crystals out of an erupting volcano and almost died doing it. Just a random thought
The finished product is to die for 😍😍. You are so talented and resourceful please keep up the good work, while us minor artists can dream of one day achieving all this 😂😂. Again thanks for your work it is truly inspiring 😍😍😍💕
I love your work!
Bobby why aren't you posting as many videos as you used too?
*Calls self lazy because he wore the same shirt two days in a row* *Also literally made exact replica model of hand drawn crystals piece by piece in ridiculously complicated process*
You're. Fucking. Amazing. Man that whole thing is just... wow...
It’s been a year I’m back
nice twerking skills
WHAT THE ACTUAL FVCK?!??!?! THIS IS INSANE!!!!!!!!
Idk why but this video was so beautiful I cried.
wow thoroughly impressed just amazing, mahalos bobby duke!
This is some of the funniest content on YouTube 😆
Holy fucking shit you've put so much work into this, it's amazing. Wouldn't designing the crystals in 3D, then 3D printing them, and making a mold out of these prints also be an option?
What sorcery is this?
The work you put into this is just incredibleeee
I was told not to trust the YT algorithm, and now I know why... this channel should have been recommended to me ages ago! *subscriiiiiibed*
6:46 i died laughing
You should do a calab with even  and katelyn
Clayton bigsby
How much money did the finish piece actually raise?
wede
Crystal d!¢|<$ haha
You are officially one of my favorite Youtubers of all time, congratulations !
Bloody amazing guys! All those artists! Well done
12:44 is like the worst puzzle ever. Pieces dont fit, there is no pattern, yet there is specific order.
Wewd does art gewd
Epicly amazing! Incredible job :D
honestly beautiful
randomly found your page from your comment on leon lush video: ""Dude, you're so funny 😂  your commentary and reactions always make me LOL."" and im glad i clicked on you!
I would love to have those gem molds
STFU, that is dope! 😲😲
Not only am I entertained, my ADHD feels epicly represented
Dope💯

So satisfying.... Good job man!
Wewd
Sorry
I love Wendt
It looks gorgeous✨✨✨✨😍😍😍
Lazy and disgusting 😂
This would be so rad around a computer monitor
@BobbyDukeArts  5:37 you ate it didn't you 😂
Fuck NFT this is the real art
Sick!!!!!
The intro was pretty much bobby out of context
Awesome
Wow so beautiful 🙏❤️🇳🇿🇳🇿
Holy guac its so beautiful and the way u grind its funny hahaha
I can't find the link to part 2 in the description
Sometimes your narrator voice sounds like Frieza from Dragon Ball, and now I can't stop imagining Frieza on his ship showing his troops how he's making the most fabulous art projects
This is what I’d call art worth millions of dollars.
3:31 that alone must have taken longer than any cashgrab video on youtube and bda just casually has that as mid-vid entertainmet.
superior crystal that got stabbed up their arse
Absolute MASTERPIECE.
really really cool! also is there any way I could get a playlist or some song titles that you use in your videos me and my family are a big fan!
did anyone else notice that the search history looked a little weird?
🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟
"In order to cut the crystal *bleeps* from. 😳 Lol Bobby?! I love how he'll just catch u off out of nowhere.
You... might've wanted to clear your search history...
new fave youtuber
The effort you go into to make it entertaining is great, glad i found your channel, its well worth it,  found your channel via the Genshin Impact vod.
Make the crystal to make the molds to make the crystals.

I want to know the budget for the stuff that bobby throws and smashes
I was howling in laughter and saying "Woah!" at the same time. This is insanely INCREDIBLE!! 🙌🌟
"Then after reestablishing dominance..." had me in tears. 😄 good stuff, man.
Oh my gawd...  Your second name should be "patience". The frame is stunning, a masterpiece, the crystals are just perfect, better than one could ever imagine before making them.  Thank you for the video, so damn inspiring.
Honestly, your art is amazing. Its something that I hope i could achieve someday.
How does this only have 4k comments? It's amazing

Hey buddy I read below that you're battling some stuff. I'm sorry to hear that. It can't be easy, but take one step at a time, one day at the time, one moment at the time. We all miss you and hope you are well. <3
When we needed him the most he folded
Is everythung ok, bobby, you have been gone for a long time
You should make something where someone is fighting like a squid  ore something.your videos are amazing.

Miss you and your content! Hope you and the family are doing well ❤️ can’t wait to see you back on your channel whenever that day comes. Lots of love! 🙏🏼🥰
Hey what happened to you ? 🙁 Just checking u posted anything 😓
Where are you bro?
I don't work with resin or anything, but I wonder if you could have saved yourself "mold" time by just making resin blanks with your initial sizes and then cutting them into sections for your multiples, before you shave them down to your ideal image you had.  Nonetheless - you never fail to amaze me, and this is just... amazing.
u already have the easiest job in the world and u cant post for 6 months lol ppl with real jobs have mental health issues too and they go to work
All *I* want to know is how to stop eating batteries.... xD  P.S. - This has got to be one of the most beautiful pieces of art let only F R A M E that I have ever seen. The thought behind every detail is beyond wonderful! I hope you are doing well and a sincere *incredible job!!!!!!!!*
Please news video
This is beyond incredible. I LOVE the frame and I LOVE the artwork. It was a super fun idea to do and it panned out incredible. Hope you're doing well Bobby, miss your awesome videos but I can always look back :D Wherever your journey takes you, thanks for allowing me to be part of a small portion of the ride.

I miss u Bobby Duke, comeback plss :´)
Hey Bobby Duke arts I got an idea what if you made a garage that can store cars miniature size cars and you can decorate it like it's been abandoned there's a hole in the roof the garage door looks all bent and the inside there's a couple paint splashes grease marks tire marks a table that has wood all over there and a bunch of tools if it's too challenging just make it not too overdone have a good day!
Come back to us booobyyy
Hey Bobby, haven't seen any new posts in a while. I hope you're OK.  All the love
Let’s take a moment to acknowledge how long the stop motion of the clay crystals took
Wow this is fantastic! 😍
Booby, where are you? Are you creating a masterpiece, stopping YouTube, or dead? Please, please send a video. You’re my favorite art YouTuber, and I just hope you are okay. I’m also speaking for other people, not just myself.
The amount of effort he puts into his videos is tremendous! Bobby definitely deserves a subscription
Br must be working on sum big his last upload was 5 months ago
"i've been procrastinating because i didn't know where to start so i think we just need to start.... aaand now it's night because i procrastinated"

Its so cool. I have seen the youtube video ( I think it was Jazza), that painted the rocket ship segment.  I thought it was actually cool then. But now the frame is so much cooler.
Can't wait for the next project! Always off the hook! Huh... there's an idea....

You are one crazy SOB and I dont think much of your safety precautions with resin etc and no mask especially working at such close quarters...but my god you are a master crafesman Bobby Duke!!!!! Your work and ideas are brilliant, amazing, awesome....you really finished off this fantastic 'one of' piece of art which will hopefully make a squillion $$$$ for a worthwhile charity.... thanks so much for sharing  your craziness with this 69 yr oldchickie from Western Australia 🇦🇺 🦘🦘🦘🦘🦘
Hi Bobby, we're checking in to make sure you and your family are doing alright. You don't know us  but my family and I are here if you need any support.

Hey!  Just wondering if you're doing alright Bobby!  Miss you!  Been a while!!!
Dude where are you i miss you  Hope everything's okay and if it's not i wish it will 🌷🌷 love u dude
Im convinced the way bobby is so relaxed is he takes out all his rage by yeeting a mug full force at a wall every video.
dude who are youuuuuuuuuuuu????? crazzzzzzy great
Is there a new video comming soon? That would be awesome and amazing 😀
This was one of the most epic art pieces I've ever seen. Those crystals look amazing.

Hope you're ok. We miss you <3
Miss you Bobby D

It’s been 4 months since the last video.. Bobby, get a move on, we need you.
I came here to wish you, from the bottom of my heart, happy times and love, much love. I don't know if you're struggling with something, working on a big project or just taking a break, it doesn't matter, I still wish you love and happiness.

so much work, beautiful result.
Hey Bobby! Hope you and the fam are doing well. Can't wait to see what jaw dropping piece of art you come up with next!!!!
Don't use wood stick in resin it creates bubbles because it is porous.  I learned the hard way
First time on your channel, but so glad YT recommended you.  Loved, loved, loved your very artistic, entertaining and unique style.  I had sat down with a cup of coffee and forgot all about it! Honestly, this is what you call a 'Masterpiece'.  You're an absolute genius, Bobby.
I can fly! join me!
Thank you for taking the time to share you're amazing abilities.
hey, weird question. so, I just found your channel today, and freaked out. I saw a guy the other day and realized he was wearing one of your shirts, he looked just like you. Were you traveling anywhere in PA? I just found your channel and felt like I might have seen you lol. I feel really stupid now bc I wanted to tell the dude his shirt was cool, but didnt. I spotted the shirt guy at an amusement park zoo. literally sat across from him.
where you at bobby? hope all is well!
Hey, it's been a while ! Hope you are good !!!
Where you at Bobby no content for some time .?????
Thank you ☺️
Thank you ☺️    I think you Artist see things differently then most and that’s a good thing for us as viewers 🤟🏻❤️

So theres this youtuber from norway that does great content called StreetmanTV, super nice guy but he didnt get his playbutton even though he deserved one
Yo Bobby, you should make a bottled ship some day.
Binged watched a bunch of your videos yesterday with my 4 yr old. Today he comes in and asks, 'Can we watch some more Bobby Wewd videos?' lol
Sir...Sir! Grab me those silicone molds. But sir you don't have any resin. Grab me them silicone molds!
Where’d you go Bobby? I need you!!!

Dichroic plastic where can I get that?

“Twerkin hard or hardly twerkin”  🤣😏
Please stop the gay act
I love you too, bobby
Holy fu....
Dayum Boy!   That is pretty darn impressive!  And here I thought it was going to be an EASY way to make the crystals.. Yikes!   But they turned out AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!  Alas, I'm just a girl and don't have HALF of the fancy tools you got there.  But hey, I liked and Subscribed because a girl can learn a thing or two..  ; ) Great job!!!!
I don't know why but I am delighted by 'the cone that is silli' (6:29).  I can't tell you how many times I've watched this video just to hear that. Is it just me?
Bobbyyyyyy!!! Its been fudging 2 months.
Hey bobby r u ok haven't seen you on here in two months i miss your videos but dont be pressured to make them .really hope you and your family are doing great .
Wtf was beeped out? Lol
man that song taps at 14 mins ish
2nd time I've seen someone used total boat,  1st time being that giant screwdriver That Jackman made
I don't have money so I don't by shit. Send me money so I can buy some shit. Whhhhaaaa hhhaaaa!!!!!! Whhhhaaaa hhhaaaa!!!! Boooo Haaaaa!!!!!
an afterthought:  ever think of tapering the long blocks that you cut down to create crystal shapes,, so that every crystal is a different size from the start? Totally groovy and gorgeous finished picture.. thanks ,,, great work
I love you Bobby Duke. You're a great entertainer.
Hey Bobby why haven’t you made more vids
Hope you’re well, Bobby.
Wow that random dude was right. You’ve got yourself a new subscriber!! I  Context: I was watching another Youtube maker..Maker Youtuber? And someone in the comments mentioned you and him being very similar(awesome projects but entertaining), so I decided to check you out and I am crackin up at that twurk 😂 I subbed. Thank you random dude on NZs channel for mentioning Bobby! So awesome!
out of ideas????
4:15 Him spraying the glowsy finish near the flowers made me unreasonably angry lmao
You are hysterical!!!!!  Jolly good job.
Insane editing. You’re a savage broski!
One of the most beautiful hand made creations I’ve seen💗😊🙏☃️
You know you have a fan base…obviously, why go this long with making any content, anything for Christ sakes. Jump on here and say, “to my friends and fans  I’m taking a short break”.       That’s all.  It would be nice!
Amazing
The opening montage STILL makes me laugh.
Hey, I have something massive for you... you must comment here if you want to see the surprise
D I D Y O U E A T T H E F O O D

Hey bobby, wouldnt it be cool if you made an elden beast out of resin?!(?
i came from ten hundred's channel. this was amazing! keep up the amazing work <3
5:33 reminds me of that suicidal meme
Can you make a keychain of the Milano from Guardians of the Galaxy
You should make knuckles from sonic 2022

Can someone please tell me what the song is at 12:54 I’ve been looking forever and I can’t find it, it’s killing me 😭
I wish Bobby was my imaginary friend
Love it!!!!
Dude, you’re a madman! The amount of work and precision in this made my bussy twitch!…that’s a good thing ;)
That'd be such a cool frame to have!!!
Dude that's gotta be your bestest yet
Crazy good😎👍
damn hes a good artist
it's very difficult for her to record this part 8:39 to 9;16 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
You are ama-ZING!
I love your videos!
The insanity/genius/artistry of custom making these crystals has blown my mind
Hey man! It’s been a while hope you’re doing good and just planning awesome arts and taking care of yourself! We’re all thinking of you and can’t wait to see you next :) ❤️
Ok just watched both videos. That wood shop is in Arlington. I live in Crowley. It is so cool that a YouTube lives so close to me in the DFW area!
Those are some juicy crystals. Does Anyone else just want to eat them?
“Twerkin hard or hardly twerkin, am I right?” I’m absolutely dying lmaooooo
Make sonic the hedgehog movie 2 characters out of clay
Hey Dukey, it’s been a while since this vid came out.  I hope you’re doing well, man.  I struggle sometimes too…it always helps me to know everything will be ok when I hear that someone’s thinking about me, so I’m paying that forward.  Have a good one, brother.
Hey Bobbers, I recommended hotones gives you a call. Get your bowels ready.
Insane! Love it!
Omg u are HILARIOUS!!! But I have to say, this is GENIE-ASS!! I love it! Thanks for sharing!
I got such a chub watching this.
2 months bobby !!!! come on m8 i need you !
I'm so glad I cams back here
Bobby, I just lost my mom and I was wondering if you did mourning jewelry
Anyone else see his search history?
I totally didn't name my d&d character Wewd
:0
Greeting from Fresno, California. LOL love ur video  and the Crystals.
OH MY GOD! what an amazing finish to such an awesome collaboration! Well done everyone!
I know it takes a while for you to get projects done but I would really love to see you post weekly instead of monthly
Exactly how long do you have to have the wig on for the wewd to harden?
Bobby is my spirit animal
Not many artist I watch intrigue me and make me laugh
Man I love the way you edit and pit in all the little skits. I know it's a lot of extra effort but it's definitely worth it. Really brings it all together and makes you that much more loveable
i’m ur biggest fan pleade i have lung cancer and my last wish is to have you added on discord pleas
You're like the zefrank1 of the art world!
Just wow!  Finished the piece perfectly
Are we sure the donk method was silly cone it looked a bit suspicious
Are you sure????   😂 Lol
This was in recommended and I am happy I clicked on it 🤗🤗🥰
if you use "," and "." to move frames at 5:38 you can see the silicon move into his mouth as he brings his tongue into his mouth at the last frame before the cut.
I wish you made more videos
really good video Bobby Duke Arts. I killed the thumbs up on your video. Keep up the solid work.
OMG That looks like (the real diamond) ok I will give it 1000000000000000000000 star but l want to know what is the liquid that you used?
Thats crazy, I stumbled upon this video not knowing what it was, but I've actually watched the other artists make this. I came here for the crystals but when I noticed which piece of art it was I said OH HEEEEEYYYYYYY
GREAT *now make it better*
I feel like latex gloves and luscious wigs are a hazard on a belt sander
Highly entertaining and I now want to make things with crystals. That frame is awesome!
since u used a song from undertale in part 1, the "GET DUNKED ON" method :3
Anyone else down here looking for a “Give me a second eye” at 2:22?
tell michael reeves to get on a normal uploading schedule
I know you are serious about your art. The art work you did is fantastic and I loved watching the process, you really added to this project. I just didn’t enjoy all the tom fullery in this video, sorry.
You sound like Frieza from DBZ! KEWL AS!
Make a mini forge for your tiny tools and tiny weapons!
YOU=) Crushed it Broheem!!
Bobby Duke is pure talent. He's inspired me to do resin and wood art. Skills that just need to be seen. I got my Bobby Duke/ten hundred shirt and I'm putting that bad boy in a frame.
Wouldn't it of been easier to make like cuboids and then sand/grind them down to crystal shapes?
I love the frame that you did, I bought the 16 x 20 with the frame and the signatures, you did as phenomenal job and it made that picture come to life!
I can relate to the "and now its night because I procrastinated, and now its the next day..."  that's just part of being a perfectionist, sometimes its not the perfect time to start.
WUUD
That is so frigging cool!!!!!!!!!!!
6:44  thank you, mater is my hero
I pray that you are doing well.
This is literally one of the most beautiful pieces of art I have ever seen.  I never thought that I could be so entranced by a work of this style.  But I am.
Do you read over comments because I really need some help!
I'm always ready for a gOOOOOOd time with you, Butt I came in to this episode on a whim and didn't expect so much crazy fun immediately. Like ADD rampage! Awemazing. Honestly you always bright my day. I can't do that for you, expect by thanking you for your channel! THAWNKU!
Was not expecting him to put on a wig and start twerking🤣
@5:01, gimme the t-shirt link
Dude you are one of the best artists I've ever seen and you are so funny you have me in tears. And now I find myself using words like wewd all the time thank you for all your entertainment.
OH MY GOD!!! I F***ING MISS YOU BOBBY DUKE!!! THOROUGHLY ENJOYED YOUR VIDEO AS ALWAYS. GREAT PIECE!!!
Great as always! For the caps I would have checked the video. I did and realized you put the caps back on wrong bottles of resin. Big one had blue cap before you opened it and had green cap later. Heidi
Who remembers when he used to start his vids by going to the shed on a motorcycle than always falls
That was very sick! 😎😱
Does anyone know the song at 2:36, it slaps
Some rich person is going to love having this in their gallery/home
I'm lost for words...this is totally amazing! 😱👌👏
Incredible work not to mention you are hilarious. You got yourself a new subscriber!
Icing on the cake man!   That finished it off perfectly!  This has been a journey!
7:48 nobody saw the history😂😂
5:35 words I said out loud earlier in the video appear in video. He really does the saying words funny too. The whole time huh. No way this guy is married unless his wife is a "Disney adult"
Good vid, were can we buy yr shirt? Its awsome
Fun fact: If you look up “wewd” you get Bobby boys channel!
This whole piece came out breathtaking. wow   PS.: does anyone know the names of the used songs in this video? The piano piece especially
That pterodactyl plastic added to the resin really makes those crystals pop.
Not gonna lie, I never thought I would live to see the day that Bobby throws it back in a video
amazing work . . .
What was that one thing you did where you painted your sanding belt with some kind of magic crystal? At 12:17, not in the morning, on the video. That was giggledy-keewl.🤨😶
Have you ever thought about doing something in black locust wewd?
That is pretty AWESOME! Well done Bobby! 👍 (I think my biggest "take away" is, I need to TWERK more. . . Maybe that will help my DEAD channel.)
I don't know why... but instead of crystals,.. fingers... yeah, fingers 😌
Oh dear… I misclicked the dislike button… If you recieve a notification saying to you someone didn’t like this video IGNORE IT, IT’S A TRAAAAP !!! Let me undo my mistake and click the Like button like I always do.  It’s done, thank you for your patience and your forgiveness Bobby Duke 🙂❤️  I like this and actually… I think… I WAANT THAAEEET😳  With love… An unknown subscriber❤️   PS : Don’t you dear to look to my username, I SAID I’M AN UNKNOWN SUBSCRI…hum
dude your production quality is insane!!! i love what you make and hope i get to see more for a long long time!!! :)
So pretty
DEAD at your "eh heheheheh ryan" intro
I want that. I want it now. Not even joking.
oh... that kind of crystal...
“Light up the runway with something from my personal collection…”  I know who this is.  “Don’t sleep on it!”
this Guy Is The Most Crazy Genius I Ever Seen..... I wish u were my Cousin
Great album on your desk.
Man the stuff this guy makes is really cool but I wish he wouldn't feel the need to talk so seriously all the time!
11:34 made my cat wake up from a dead sleep to gag NANSNBDBXNDNBXBX
You remind me of an old Smosh video energy in a creative man and thats a compliment. Very cool.
3:58 if only cleaning up messes was this easy
everytime I see you pick something up at the end I always fear you'll drop it XDD
Bro did u die u haven't posted any vids in a month
Hey Bobby I love your art and how funny you make your videos. But I have a suggestion for what you should make on your next video. Can you make a frog on a rock but carve it form the same rock it is on?
That reveal gave me goosebumps, absolutely amazing and it all comes together perfectly, also you're hilarious so added bonus.
just found you and im obsessed
I subscribed at "lazy and disgusting." But mostly because you're funny 😁
when Mr. beast reaches 100 million subs. you should make him an award like you did for pewdipie
First time here watching this ship station of the arts thingy! Let me tell you whaaaauut I'm hooked like little on Debbie brother!  I also see that you are David Blain's family as well with the floating on  air!!!!!! Lol
This content is what I want rather than some green guy doodling and giving away money without respecting his fellow artist
Well wasn’t expecting a full on sage stick being burnt
Your so inspiring I stopped making art for a while because I was getting so stressed but I found your videos again and I'm already making more!!
This guy is so amazing he spends hours moving little plaster crystals to make a cool video for us.
I enjoy your kind of craziness. Subbed.
👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 My art and design tutor always told me that I put sooooo much more than needed time into my work!! I get the same vibes here.. although both finalized artwork of mine and yours definitely shines much brighter given the effort put in......must say VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!!!!👌👌👌👌👏👏😁🎖️💯
TEN HUNDRED + BOBBY DUKE ARTS = MY NEW ADDICTION Thank you for the inspiration and entertainment!!!!!!!! Love both of you!!!!!! :)
This shit will be worth millions one day...odd
If Aunty donda could paint but actually funny.
the inlays look like semi legitimate opals and thats a FAT W
Monsieur Dukie,  AWMAYZIN JURB MIY GEWD MAYN! You are Talented Beyond Belief (as well as "Crafty" in every sense of the word) !  I continue to love all your videos, and most of all, your delightful personality! KEYP OHN KEYPAN OHN! PS: can people be spirit animals?
Bro, the very first two comments I see are from ten hun and doke.... Show me that path to this level of rad! 🙏
lol crystal dukey!
who is this strange man and his mystical creations, how delightful.
Bro you did so well on the crystals that I thought the thumb nail was photoshopped into the picture
What was the music used in the ending? Would love to add that to my playlist.
"It's not like plastic or wewd." 😂 idk why that got me lol
I appreciate you as an artist and as a stranger lmao- your artistry and humor are so well balanced amen 💀💀😂😂😂
Bobby finally learns how to make crystal meth!
Art is amazing but the comedy is fantastic
Would love to have a crystal boarder around my monitor that would glow everytime I turned my pc on
This could be a nice nft collection
I think girls would absolutely love this as a frozen themed mirror
The chaotic energy is strong here. It was beautiful.
Now i need a set of Dice that are Crystals.... yay
I may have said this before, but it bears repeating: You are hands down my favorite person on YouTube. Also, I’m pretty sure you’re the only other person on the planet with a sense of humor remotely close to mine. My only complaint about your channel is that I wish you would put out more videos. However, as a 51 year old adult male, I get why you don’t. I still think you’re an awesome human Bobby Duke. Keep up the great content!
2:36 Sounds like Stranger Things music.
Crystals lookin 99.1% pure
Awh man I wish I had one of those. It's so kewl❤️❤️❤️❤️
Boy this gave me goosebumps
damn I had to mute this
My man legit sat here making a stop motion conga line of crystal molds for 10 seconds of B-Roll. Holy shit
“The cone that is silly”😂😂
This channel is my happy place every bad day i have 🥰
i really appreciate the fact that after not watching your videos for a while and forgetting your channel name, all i had to do was type "wewd" into the search bar, and you're the first thing that pops up. lol
Make a tiny supermarket shopping cart. 1/10 scale.
Amazing video
all the crooks and nannies huh
what video editing software do ya use ^-^
Get with the times bobby I've been making crystals in my basement for years now, and I've only been arrested twice.
silicone, the forbidden bubblegum
this was a fucking fever dream, I will be back for another the next time you post
Least insane artist
Amazing!
Can we appreciate how much work not only went into this piece but into the video itself? The editing was really good!
Now THIS is how you do a proper collab! After ZHC's exposure thanks to Jazza it's nice to see a proper collab between creators that focuses on what's important. The WORK, not some stupid 'side games', or scammed giveaway nonsense.
now you have glossy flowers 4:21
You made crystals and didn’t make a braking bad joke bit
So.. what you're saying is this is the guy voicing the next Frieza arc?
MY MIND IS BLOOWN. I LITERALLY GASPED.
I actually cried watching this come together holy cow...
wow you are so gifted! amazing work
Wish I was creative and artistic
Awesomeness
Bobby: keeps things for future use Also bobby: we are going to do something totally new and unique Love it
Bomb ass work on those crystals! An my God at the editing work you put in!
Bobby I’m new to your channel And I’d like to say your content is amazing! High quality, perfectionist tier stuff!  Your merch is ugly tho. I’d buy everything you make but not your merch.
lub the content bobydew
the lateralus record on your shelf is perfection
Why does no one talk about the Ryan vine cameo
6:45 if you know it you know it. . . . . i hate myself for knowing it.
Absolutely stunning
I didn’t watch the first video this intro is the most confusing thing I’ve ever seen
This looks like Berried Alive merch
and the answer was... WWOOOOODDDD of course!  Another awesome vid :)
my toxic trait is thinking i can do this without practice or knowledge
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Amazing!!! Loved watching the video, funny, creative and very entertaining!
That is AMAZING!! I have been a fan of @DokeTV for years. Just found your channel. Great collaboration 💖
6:28 O- ohh- ug Ag.. OUG n- no Duke🤢
Such a nice piece
Cool. Now do crystal meth.
it hasz ben so lon suns i havsen you
W
tbh the frame needs a better picture to match its level of awe
Videos would be better with out the gay voices he does
Gorgeous work 💠💠💠 please wear a protective mask next time you pour resin, the fumes are super damaging (even though resin is deceptively not ‘fumey’)… don’t want your lungies getting hurt 🫁🥲
battleblock theater guy is that you??? glad you're ok man
Please never twerk again
what if you do that on computer monitor
quality content
i would sell my firstborn for that frame, ngl
reminds me of megamind
A masterpiece
Oh man thank you for exposing me to this project. I just watched all the videos, what an amazing process!
I’m less confused as to how I got here, as I watch Evan and Katelyn, but still very entertained! You’re really hilarious actually 👏
Aaaaah those turned out so incredible!! ♥.♥ Well done!
This is a weird Breaking Bad episode.
OMG that is beeeeeauuuutiful the twerk was OKKKKAY (more butt, less back) lol
Love the editing style! Good job!
"Wow, that slaps."
... xD YouTube was just like: *gives video with no context*  THANK YOU!! I love it xD      7:29 pog (lol my name is Peter lol sorry)
Bobby: “I don’t know what I’m doing / I have no idea how I’m gonna do this.”  Also Bobby: *does it perfectly*
love this, but pls pls pls use mask/resp when using totalboat resin 😩😩😱😱😱😱
God that's so cool. My guy. My guy. Props to every holy shit.
By the way tell your wife I think she is so bless to have a silly,artist with a very rare way of making people laugh, I wish I could find a guy like him, God bless you an your family
The wings video was the first video I watched, great video it made me want wings for the back of a human, but make it on a stand were people could stand an get pictures taken in some way that it look like giant wings  I think you get the point I hope
I would love to see you dabble in PMC3! Great video, the piece came out amazing <3
First time seeing the channel and video. Now this is quality entertainment !!
So two things: 1. I friggin love this and how fantastically intense you are about making your art the way you want it. It's insanely inspiring and so much fun to watch.  2.  All I hear is the "teddy has an operation" (type it in YouTube if you haven't seen it)  narration whenever you do that voice. This makes me that more happy and exited to watch this video.  Okay I said two but one more thing... 3. I'm so happy I found your channel! Yaayy!
Part 1:How can i create something that does not stand out from the frame? Part 2:Inserts a led strip so that the crystals glow.
Now take a picture, destroy the art and sell the png as an nft. :3
WHAT A WAY to become a new subscriber ... this collaboration was EPIC. OMFG Bobby ... THIS FRAME. You made me cry dammit !!! 🥲💜
That is absolutely the most ridiculously beautiful thing I’ve seen, unbelievable amount of work, fun presentation and incredible result!!! Love it
You sound like the alien from resident alien... i luve it :>
Oh oh 😳 umm, geometry & uhh, probably several, algebras, & **cough** 😱😱😱😱😱  AAAAAAaaaaaAAAaaaaaaaaahhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhHhHhhhhhH!!!!!!! 💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️
This isnt the crystal i came for
wow the energy in making this whole video definitely shows. also great camera work and editing.
I sure did miss ya Bobby boy, let's get it Poppin👍🏽
that painting goes SO hard
This video was entertaining to say the least
YT us strange i swear I keep subscribing to you
super cool irl nft bobby!
you can get tablets for that !
As always….Jaw dropping and phenomenal. You consistently raise the bar far far beyond expectation and imagination. This came out absolutely amazing. I love a good colab but this literally is the top GOAT colab of them all. Everyone involved has brought their very best skills and put their hearts into this. Gorgeous work folks.   Hey Bobby, you are not alone in bing anal retentive/OCD about things being a certain way when it comes to detail and sizing of things for projects. I swear it comes with the creative gene us artists have. 😉 you’ve created something absolutely brilliant and captivating yet again that nobody expected. Keep raising that creative bar man, cause you inspire the rest of us feeling we can do the same.
Bobby: 1:01 - "You may not know this about me, but when it comes to art, I am a hyper-perfectionist that wants things to look exactly the way I want them." also Bobby: 4:24 - "And it's the next day! Yes I'm wearing the same shirt, but that's because it's an awesome shirt. Also I'm lazy and disgusting."  Sounds about right. Truly, captured the dichotomy of the perfectionist.
Your energy is my favorite energy.
This is so awesome!!!!!!!!!
That would be soooo bad ass for like....a computer frame. xDDD Imagine it jutting out from the side of a computer screen man? ASTHETICS.
This popped on my recommended. Never seen this channel. Know absolutely nothing. Has to be the most chaotic energy I've ever seen.
6:46 DONT SLEEP.
The frame was better than the art tbh :/
This was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen! Bobby you shold try to do a diorama!! I'm sure you would kill it!!! Hope you're okey and taking care of yourself! :)
So I finally got around to watching this, and OMG it is INCREDABLE
sounds illegal
i would say this art piece alone worth several millions of dollar
I need this but as s monitor
Are you going to make more videos
The stop motion animation of the sculpted epoxy crystals was dope, must've taken a long ass time
5:33 actually gets some in beard
THE EDITING ON THIS VIDEO
This was such a cool project! I follow at least two of the other artists in the line-up and this makes me wanna go check out their contributions, along with everyone elses, in more detail!
11:58 The eye-widening when he realized how much work he had ahead of him got me 😂
that edit.. those camera shot ! this acting ! my god bro this is insane !! haha verry happy that i just discovered you !
Day: 124 of asking for attack on titan sculptures
Respect for the crystals!
What was the song at 10:36 and the other one at 11:07?
😂 I loved everything about this video, especially the fact you found time to inclue stop-motion animation!  The finished piece is stunning! 😁
Bobby so glad to see you back! Your videos truly make me smile and even on my worst depression days, you make me laugh. That is truly hard to do honestly. I miss your face, know that you are truly a greatness among men here on YouTube and I don't say that lightly. Your family is so blessed to have you and I am so glad to have found your channel when I did. God bless you and yours. You talented wud worker you!
I don't care if I can retain all the knowledge bestowed upon me, The Duke makes me laugh.
Needs exact dimensions - uses imperial meassures xD
Title is very misleading
does the piece have a name?
I could easily watch that final reveal about a million times or more. 😱🤣💖
Make Thor first hamer
Jesus christ Bobby. That was so so amazing and seriously this was just dope to see. Keep up the dope work.
Insane !
I was drinking when the fart sound came out of the last silicone mold. I almost died. Thank you.
Color me impressed there, Bobby Duke
I'm such a child I laughed SO HARD at the air compressor fart joke 😂. The finished product is beyond cool. I can't believe you carved like 70 unique crystals for this but I think it was worth it.
hey bobby do you still do fan mail?
What's the value add of him mispronouncing every word?
Bobby’s creative humor gets me every time 👍
i dont know i think you mite need another channel for all the funny stuff
A 'buttload' huh? Heteros say 'boatload'
God damn!!! That's THE best piece of art Ive ever seen!
Bobby I love you not for what you do but your personality I love it !
Chester V from cloudy w a chance of meatballs
The gooey molds were probably the result of a chemical incompatibility.  Check the silicone that stayed gooey and see if it's platinum cure (platsil).  If it is that means the Apoxy Sculpt probably has sulfur in it.  Sulfur and platinum silicone don't play well together.  Make sure you use tin cure silicone instead.  Sulfur doesn't bother tin cure silicone. That'd be my guess.
No offense to all other artists, but the Frame looks better than everything else
I love your videos you are so expressive and also i like wewd -_(.-. )_-
the amount of unnecessary time he puts into his art is rediculous...ly great
That was some sick ass editing with that screen tear man. I don't know who edits these videos, but that was awesome.
stunning  would love to  purchase
The Google searches 😂
what is the voice changer you use
I am a licensed massage therapist that works at a hospital in Kentucky. I have a patient that I see daily that loves to draw and has been stuck in the hospital for several weeks. I introduced her to your channel today. And while I might help her smile for 15 minutes a day when I give her a treatment, Your shows gave her the ability to smile all day. I know how good it feels when somebody tells you that you're doing good when you don't even know it. I just thought you should know how awesome you are.  Thanks for the beauty and light you bring. You Rock!
Wonderful beautiful
I haven't seen part one and I thought this was some awesome thing to fit on to like a computer or laptop top screen and clicked because my kid would love that.. but my god is it still beautiful! Guna show him anyway😂❤
That Thing! Is Awesome!
Dope, Dukey. Dope.
you are nuts! in a good way ^^"
The actual picture is cool, but the frame is breathtaking. Easily the most incredible part of this piece. Well done, Bobby. Well done 👏
Amazing artwork. A masterpiece
You sir, have the patience of a god.
Hey bobby, can you make a mini fender stratocaster? please do!!!
what's that song playing at 11:10?
wait why does it say this was uploaded Jan 31... 2022
Remember resin is not your friend, use mask and extractor hood above while drying, cause once you inhale it, a tiny slice of resin gets in your lungs and won´t come out again... Amazing work by the way 😇😁
🥲🤍 WOW  !!!!
bobby duke yyou cray man
Lovely work I was wondering why there's jazza head behind
Amazing! As all your art and silliness is. I LOVE this crystal frame and the artwork. I love the entire freaking video in every way. Love that you shout out all those that helped. Lol it's a good thing you saged the crystals for positive charge and cleansing, appreciated that lol. I WANT THAT frame and I just wanted to flood your comments with love..because I love all that mentioned.
That is one AMAZING PIECE!!! I'd definitely put that in my house! Bobby don't play when it comes to his art and perfection! Also, his personality is insanely funny! 🤣🤣🤣
“Then after re-establishing dominance” Proceeds to do The Roof on his table
I finally got my sticker is going straight on my computer
Just DOPE
😅❤🌹
This would be really cool as like a monitor frame/case for a gamers setup
The tweaks LMAO 🤣 😂 😆 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
looks amazing
How many bikes do you need XD
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cant tell final product because of stupid bouncing of zoom, camera angles..etc.   Set it on a wall, turn down lights, turn on frame..hold camera steady..  really that simple.
Great artist. Too bad he's so annoying
*pulls out wallet* how much for this beautiful painting good sir?
True facts: Bobby duke edition
His intro and he has 4m subs
The level of fidelity between the sketch and the final is WILD. You really just went "If I can draw this good, there's no need for an alternate design". I'm inspired. Let's be real, the hand-drawn version is always the better version if you put confidence into it and trust it. This kind of thinking could really cut down on my workload as an artist.
Bobby, AMAZING. This is absolutely museum quality. I don't know where it's going or who gets it, but it should make the rounds at places like Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art and galleries & museums like it. I know I personally would pay to stand in front of it to look at it. Really an amazing job. Kudos to you, sir.
HEY MAN! WHEN ARE WE GUNNA GET THAT DRAGON IN ARMOR YOU PROMISED US? IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS...YEARS, DUDE! COME ON!
Are you still sober
Grow them.
See how awesome we are when we create things together!?!!
Meh, boring
Finished the Playlist....AMAZING!!! ABSOLUTELY OTHERWORLDLY!♡♡♡ (tell me why I'm CRYINGT^T.....why?!? lol so beautiful it brought me to tears lmao wtf...)  so awesome all the pain staking work & love that went into this jaw dropping piece!♡♡♡♡
loved the vid and especialy the reveal the music pulsated through me.!
er
🎶Painting the roses clear
Definitely worth the wait
Damn... I wish I had the money to buy it.
I came here to find meth crystal.
We've measured the earth, theres no curve anywhere. We see mountains from 300 miles away, thats not possible on NASA's globe. Theres no proof the earth is moving. The 2nd law of thermodynamics says outerspace isnt real. Cannot have gas pressure next to a vacuum.
This is so dope!
Bob
you give me stereotypical gay mad scientist vibes, and i just love it
🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏😘👌
Haha, only made it 5 minutes when I had to say. This Is awesome. Love the way you made the video of art an art of making art! Thanks!  Inspired
I wanna put a space themed picture in this. Amazing.
12:53 song?
Amazing work - your level of commitment and effort to bring this to life is impressive.
wow what a great finish for this piece
Definitely shoulda started singing “give me a second I, I need to get my story straight” when you started beating the square rods lol
Damn everything about this is amazing. from the actual art to the video editing. amazing.
Insane amount of work that goes into each video, and so much fun! Thank you for sharing yourself with the world
for some reason I thought it was going to be a fancy monitor bezel either way this is very impressive
Man you so fan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:19 this is a pretty good producer tag
How many carats are those?
That is amazing!
Man, you're such a joy to watch. Your attention to detail just creates absolute magic.
So awesome.....great job everyone!!!!! I particularly loved the crystals. They are gorgeous!
Those crystals look sensational! 💜 You make it all look so easy!
Hey Bobby, I just wanted to say in my opinion you are the artistic YouTuber, BUT what if you took it to the next level? maybe by chance in VR? or just the way you do it honestly I don't care which one you pick, just keep having fun, and who knows maybe you'll do a family project someday, not trying to shoot a idea, but if I did then sorry I think, but nonetheless, I was actually think on becoming a YouTuber someday, don't know where or when, but even if people tear my wings off, I'll still soar through the sky, reaching for my dreams.  So what I'm trying to say is don't let go of your dreams and I know many people say that, but this is coming from someone who made a lot of mistakes in my life, and if any get stressed out at school, work, or even at home playing games just remember, you have the power to fix the world, and maybe even wars, so let's heal this once beautiful and turn it back to the land it once, and stop all of the dangerous groups out there, so let's all make a change by donating anything, and if you find someone in need, maybe talk to them, they would probably like a conversation once in awhile, so come on let's fix THE WORLD
Channeling his megamind Haha
your video quality is so so so so exceptionally incredibly you... a lot of people don't procrastinate but few produce what you do
I only realised what project this was right at the end when I saw Martina’s painting! Truly epic finish to an epic project.
silly cone CROOKS AND NANNYS
You make me feel so much better about my chaotic ADHD energy some days are so good and some days you just cant get your stupid brain to cooperate and it frustrating sometimes
Baddassssssss
That came out amazing
And at 5:11 in to the video I have realize you are my spirit animal
I’m gonna bypass the creepy face but what the hell are you smashing
my ears are bleeding after this video
4:30 ‘I’m lazy and disgusting’ *proceeds to spend hours upon hours on minute details*
Bobby Duke has the personality of the annoying kid brother and I am LIVING for it
I like how he’s like adult funny but also family friendly LOL
Dude. Talent doesn't even come close to what you -- and the other Art-Tubers -- got, both individually and especially collectively. 1,000,000 times Ten 100 / 10.👏🏾
Love your addition to this fantastic project. And . . . I got my Bobby Duke 10 Hundred shirt today! Woot Woot 🎺
HEY,I DONT KNOW WHAT LEAD ME TO THIS VIDEO BUT I LOVE IT! GREAT MERCH BTW... NEW SUBBIE!!!!  cause I want a t-shirt 😊🇨🇦
Dear bobby, can you link things you use in the video? Like the total boat resin? I tried looking for it on amazon and such, and kept getting it with mixed reviews. If anyone can lead me in the right direction,  it would be much obliged.
The stop motion efforts at 13:30 were the sublime perfect addition for the big reveal, and with perfectly selected music.  What CAN’T you do?  😄👍🏻  I mean besides not twerk?  🙈
666k views!
holy keyframing
Its always a great day when bobby uploads. Its a rare TASTY treat
My absolute most favorite thing about Bobby Duke is that if you don't really pay attention he's making really cool things, but if you do pay attention, he is absolutely and insanely talented and his creativity is unmatched.
ART FABRICATION IS LIFE
A great title for the intro of this video would be "Bobby Duke Arts out of context"
Make it a NFT and sell it for $3M 😀
Binging and seeing the journey this piece has made and watching it evolve was just amazing and really made that final reveal something else, I think this is truly what you call, a masterpiece.
3:10 where can I get that mask? I really need it because I've been getting into woodworking and it also looks dope
Your enthusiasm, talent, attention to detail, and goofing are a joy to witness. Bless you!
I had been looking forward to this video and the previous one for so long, I didn't even watch them immediately when I saw they were up, but saved them for a perfect moment, just enjoying the fact I knew that I soon would. So funny, man(!). And that final result. Wow. Just wow. Beautiful! The perfectionist-ism😄 that you put into it and the way it goes so well with the painting without detracting from it, like someone said below. Pure joy! I love it. Without exaggerating. ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you. 😊
What is the name of the song at the end?
i admit- i have add and i watching the ENTIRE VIDEO- and i would watch it again-
Glad you wore the shirt two days in a row, I didn't realize it was a Ten Hundred shirt til then! Happy to see two great artists supporting each other :)  Also this build is INCREDIBLE! Well done!!!
This video was very enjoyable love how it turned out.
great result but such a dull video, its hard not to skip through it when its so cringy..
2:50 umm ..... danm he has some cake sorry ;-;
This is wild to see bc I did a crystal mold project last year having never worked with resin or casting before, and came up with many of the same solutions you're using, including putting eye screws in the bottom of my crystal pieces and painting on silicone cocoons (i used hardware silicone tho lol)  Awesome video <3
Wow really great 👍  😁
hey bobby can you email me
thats fuckin amazing 😍🔥
that is amazing and love all your work and watching your videos
Now we just have to wait for 100 years so that Baumgartner can restore it
You are one incredible artist... what you do never ceases to amaze me.
One reason some of your silicone molds failed to cure may be due to inhibition caused by your spray-on coating on the epoxy blanks (especially if it was polyurethane based).
3:36 can we just appreciate how much time those 10 seconds must have taken to make?
is that green plate bothering anyone else?
5:24 I'm in tears...LOL.
You were such a good account :(
Now this is pure art. Compared to those ugly ass NFTS
This is true art
And now the flowers are glousy:P
Would you be willing to please do an updated tool and shop tour?  It's been years, you probably upgraded tools by now.
This guy single handedly destroyed the momentum behind this whole project.  He's had it for what, like 4 months?   Get your shit together dude.
13:26 i was not expecting the transition to be this clean. i can see this took alot of effort... and it just shows ur passion. Even though i am subscribed already i wish i could subscribe again and like ur video twice for this. this encouraged me also to not procastinate cause i want to be glad about my final products just as u are.
I NEED THIS AS A MONITOR
This editing is so good
Got butterflies in my tummy when you turned off the lights and we could see the frame shine
The only frame that may have taken longer to make than the actual painting, and look equally or more so stunning! The frame just elevates the whole thing!
This is just wow!
Cure inhibition. If your epoxy clay has sulfur in it, many silicones won't cure completely when coming in contact with the sulfur in the Epoxy.
Sankyu wewd
So, do you eat it 🌚
Couldn't you just made the blanks from scrap wood?! Instead of expensive epoxy clay
I have 3 words for you: WOW
Wow I’m a first time viewer and yea just wow that’s amazing!!!
Bobby please help me, I’m looking for the video where you ride a unicycle on the roof.  Please tell me I didn’t dream it. 😂
I don't care if you hear this a lot, you can never be told enough that you and the art you do is amazing! Truely inspiring to me and my wife.
Truly the best ending for such an epic collab.  The talent from every single artist is astounding and I'm glad to have witnessed it.
ᶜʳᵒᵒᵏˢ ᵃⁿᵈ ⁿᵃⁿⁿᶦᵉˢ
That's stunning 🎆🎆🎆 Shame, I couldn't like it million times 😍
did he just gloss his flowers..........
10:58
This seriously belongs in a museum. Like when is MOMA gonna call?
Twerkin' ain't easy!!
Rome wasn't built in a day!
You worked so hard on all that, and I'd definitely say that it paid off! Great job!
3:37 how long did that take to do?
IF THIS MAN CHANGES THE THUMBNAIL ONE MORE TIME
Now you just gotta rig it to descend into an integrated wood chipper immediately after the auction.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamazing!
My daughter loves watching this guy she's 6, she goes around calling everyone goobas
You're awesome 🥰😘
This is amazing, you are hilarious and I  LOVE the channel!
Super fantastic
Sorry but there's too much Satanism is your videos.
dfs
Looks insane good job
it almost feels like God forgot to put creativity in 1000 people and counteracted it by putting it in bobby.
This is so beautiful! I honestly love the crystals, I would even love to make molds like that it's so neat!
13:30 praise the sun
Bro I love you man 😂❤️
For all of work you put in from the art down to the editing, I watch the ads without skipping Bobby D 😎
The amount of effort put in all these videos🤧 i love u man
He has insane stop motion at the beggining and end like Robby said
Is this guy's vocabulary going backwards
I work with the wooooood too, its been a while since I've watched ya, I forgot u were funny lol
on to the question that I've had ever since this whole thing started... who will have this?
For anyone who wants to know the song at the end of the video, it's called Flaw by AGST
I agree with every positive comment. Your video making skills and attention to detail is impeccable. Absolutely beautirifiness.....  And you're hilarious, I can't quit laughing. Don't ever stop.
That, is impressive
shinanishits
OMD LOVE IT!!!UR THE BOSS💪
Great work! The fart sound effects kept making catching me off guard so now cinnamon toast is on my pants XD
4:24 Phenomenal transition
Does he have a place he just displays all the things he’s made
Bobby Duke is my spirit animal
this is hard to watch
Pure joy watching you work amazing
ерунда. по большому счету. Кривляется как клоун
Very cool project, as usual.  Do you think in hindsight it would have been easier to make the crystal blanks from wood?  Just wondering.
How does this not have millions of views by now?
that twerk  im dead😂😂😂
I will buy that painting off you guys for 100,000 dollars
It was 100% the icing to the cake. Everyone who worked on this is so talented, I and speechless!
This is not just art, it’s a true, once in a lifetime masterpiece!!! 💙 A true collab + and epic frame made by this crazy artiste!! Epico!!! 💖💖💖
Dope 🔥
Why was you showing off your unique, distinguished porcelaine plate collection in such a humble way the best thing in this video
😂 I missed this goofiness. Haven’t come back to this channel in a long time, and while I’m being lazy about my own projects(and thinking up others) I decided to watch this.
2:22 give me a second I
I want to ask something since I couldn't find anyone else asking. since you finished the frame in 2022 but didn't sign it for 2022 but instead 2021 does that mean you signed it for 2021 because that was when the whole collaboration was being done or was it a mistake? please let me know.  :/
Not only does he put lots of effort into his creations but In his videos as well. Definitely a new comfort YouTuber<3
You’d be a good voice actor I feel like
Make a Pot of Greed
Two minutes in and I can't breathe. God. Killing me. XD This was just so amazing. I wish I had the patience and that skill.
12:08 Sunglasses
6:29 The cone which is silly
4:15 Bobby Duke unknowingly begins to murder a plant 😂😂😂
My fav "Things making" guy😁😅
I can't believe YouTube lets me watch Bobby Duke videos for free.
Draw jopping  This is literally my favorite thing you’ve ever made. You are a literal god. Like the reveal and with the lights and the everything Holy shit
its really cool, you should get a 3d printer if you plan to do molds that exact! I would gag at just the thought of making all those crystals by hand, but i respect de craft
Huge undertaking for a fantastic Finnish, looks amazing😇
what's the music at 13:24 ?
this isn’t cool.  this isn’t even amazing. this is the coolest most amazing thing ever i love it i wsnt it
Can you make Naruto in god mode
Ficou maravilhoso!! Parabéns pelo magnifico trabalho!!
Wow wow amazing work! A frame that is a masterpiece 💖💖👌👌👌
Hmmmm, I’m happy I’m not the one who has to clean up after you LoL 😝 Nice to see exercise your back and butt. Keeps you healthy. LoL
This was amazing work and an amazing collab-series... Now for the serious question. How do you pack and send this safely back to Ten Hundred?
I think you made the biggest effort on that art.
I have never seen anything as epic, beautiful and overall awesome in my entire life. You did a very good job on the frame and I love the new merch as well. Keep up your awesome work Bobby 👏
Can’t wait to get paid so I can get some of that merch! Anyway I really love your channel so much, always brightens my day when I get the chance to watch your uploads!
Oh my god I want to eat it
It turned out absolutely amazing! I'm assuming Ten Hundred gets to keep it. Lucky guy 🙂
You are so talented! I know you hear and see that often, but dang!! Your amazing! This frame and artwork…..stunning! Stay safe out the Bobby!! ❤️❤️
Bobby: you may be wondering… how am I going to make the crystals? Well give a warm welcome to out guest, Bryan Cranston!
Bobby Duke jak zwykle montaż 10/10, jakości wykonania dzieła 10/10, całość 2/10 XD żart XD Polish people say goodbye.
It's a tank please you will be the first person on YouTube to make it I think anyway out of wood please do it I will do   Enything of gerand
Bobby can you make kb44 🥺🥺🥺 I'm a huge fan
6:46 was funny asf
That is absolutely gorgeous. You did an amazing job man.
6:45 that's a deep cut 💀
I get a lot of Paul Rudd vibes from you lmao
Totally Cubular
UND BOBBE HOW AR YOU GOHING TO GET ZE NEEW DIEPA?
Remember your crystal isn't real.
I don't say this very often, but.... I'm Impressed.  Seriously. That was way cool. :)
💜💜💜💯💯💯👏👏👏👏
wtf bobby why are u changing title and thumbnail again and again
"I want that" lmao SO awesome!
Not only did you do it justice, you elevated it to a whole new level!
That is insane.... Such and awesome collab and what an outcome.  The frame fits in so well with the overall piece and it is just stunning.  Great work done by all involved.
Dude, honestly I absolutely love you and what you do....but this vid may need a trigger warning....My wife suffers real bad with tripophobia and got massively freaked out by your molds...🤣🤣👍
Does anyone else have this problem???  When I sit down to make my own resin miracles with Bobby’s channel on… I just sit there for HOURS… forgotten brush in hand… bottles of resin on the desk, gathering dust… thinking to myself: this is the most delicious edutainment on the whole internets, and it is WRECKING my projects because I can’t tear my eyes away long enough to actually get to work! 😂   CURSE YOU FOR BEING SO WONDERFUL
I hope you stay relevant forever, I'm always here for it
Lol, when does the NFT of it go up for sale?
Mr. Duke, I must say that I completely enjoy your videos.  Man you are nucking futs and I really like that.  Your skill and talent are beyond measure.  Just wish you could turn out more videos.  They make me smile all day.  You are fantastic.
Sick dude 🤯
We now know the secret behind the dude who built the Fortress of Solitude. Bobby Duke is from Krypton.
Yea we did the
Y I’m
Man that is out of this world!! No compliment would do it justice.
this is the kind of thing you see at an artists house and they tell you they bought it for 40k
so beautiful 💖💖. hope there's more somethin like this next time.
He's like the Paul Rudd of youtubers, super entertaining and yet so talented
Cool!
Love from India 👍🏻🙏🏻👌🏻😊❤🇮🇳💐 👑King of detailing Bobby Duke ❤
If there was any sulfur on the original crystal shapes made from the wood, then it will inhibit the silicone from curing. The orange one was probably formulated to be more forgiving since it was made for molds, but the clear can be used for all sorts of things and most likely there was sulfur in the paint.
Booby duKay... it is bee-yootiful. Love the work, never stop. I mean, stop if you need to for mental or physical health reasons, but otherwise, please never stop.
can someone please tell me what this sounds like 12:04 - 12:07 because it sounds so familiar
What a sick wall piece thats gona be
I love the commentary and editing.
I couldn’t place who you remind me of sometimes until you said “twerking hard or hardly twerking” and I had sudden clear visions of Zaphod Beeblebrox from Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy 😂 idk, similar intonations and quirky humour? Somehow it just fits.
Can you make a bone dagger?
Calling it now. Best piece of Art for the DECADE. Absolutely fantastic job by all involved. Anyone would be proud to display this on their wall. I highly suspect if people are still here in 100 years, this work of art will be one of the most valued pieces. Yeah I know resin ages, but that's good for stopping the forgeries. 👍
your work is always mind blowing
Bobby has the best outros by far
This man talks like Chester V
This is intense!!! Bravo to everyone!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Can't believe we went to Part 2 after Part 1...
I wonder if the other molds didn't cure entirely because he put the lid on and cut off air. Does anyone know if it requires oxygen exposure to cure?
Why isn't this man on dancing with the Stars

In regards to the crystals, how is it that the colored plastic seems to have incorporated into the resin instead of looking like bits of plastic suspended inside the resin?
6:36 forbidden corndog 😈😈
It's beautiful
This guy is funny, creates the most stunning art from nothing, and puts so much attention to detail into his videos, it's all too incredible!
Stoonin!
Bobby, hun, that pull edit. *Chef kiss*
Can someone tell me the difference between apoxie and epoxy? (Please don’t say the spelling 😏) Also, I’m seriously impressed at the time that was put into each singular crystal! Wow.
Love <3
The amount of effort he puts in his videos is so inspirational and just y out can tell he loves what he does
light up the runway with something from my personal collection
This whole collab is out of this world, I am blown away ❤️
Amazing vid!! Really love your content, keep up the good work
11:39 BROO WHATTT
Great job Bobby
WHO IS THIS GUY? And why am I only discovering him now? Where have you been hiding him youtube? Hilarious, creative and did I mention hilarious? Immediate subscribe, and off to spend several hours of my day binge watching his previously posted videos!
OMG!   I am scarred for life! 2:51  Lmao 😂
13:30 Praise the Sun!!
"charging" the crystals got me good. Well done
10:58 My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.

And that piece is sick! I had no idea so many of you worked on it. So damn awesome!
Dude! I love everything about this video. It is so well produced and it’s clear you put the same amount of effort into everything you do. So awesome!

Amazing work 👏👏👏
I can’t decide what I like the most: your frame, your skills, or your comedy. Amazing!
you are the master TouTuber creator master. jeeeeayyyzzzooossss
Shut the front door... this is SO dang DOPE.  Bless all who are part of this world.
Bobby.. OMG, that was simply incredible. No words to explain how I felt watching you bring your vision into reality 🙌🙌
I thought that the joke about eating the orange stuff was going to be a transition into another Hello Fresh sponsor
Good ol bismuth crystals.

"And now it's night because I procrastinated." MOOD.
What museum is this absolute beast going to end up being displayed in?! I need to go see it.
10:52 he does it better then me
This is AWESOME!!!
5:38 going frame by frame you can tell he definitely got some of that shit on his tongue :'D
NGL, I actually like the frame more than the picture...
That is epic! True art! not Banksy sh1t 👏👏👏👏
W😍W
This is so sick! It turned out amazing!
YOU SHOULD MAKE ONE OF THOSE ART PIECES THAT ARE SPREAD APART AND IS CONNECTED BY A STRING FROM THE CEILING YK??
Here we see the Duker in its natural habitat  The Duker is a creature that is in reclusion most of the year and when they finally emerge they do so with great splendor.  Unfortunately the Duker is endangered due to its habit of confusing nutritional food with silicone and other toxic materials. You may find a Duker in your average tool shed, any creative materials store near you or in places you would least expect. About as rare as a unicorn sighting the a sighting of a Duker is indeed almost never heard of , in fact there are tales of the majestic Duker only showing himself to a select chosen few that are said to be pure of heart, hardy in their creative pursues, carry materials (especially rocks) or if they carry food, more specially  if they carry coffee
Not the niche @mlazri reference
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's wonderful,T-T it really is. I hope to see it in real life one day.
The way you pronounce *pro*crastinate makes it sound like a flex
All things aside... that tape still bothers me lol .
NOT THE "light up the runway" BOBBY NOOO
ok, eating the orange silicon part made me lolz
this would be way better in person 🔥
Such a fantastic work of art!!! I love your videos Bobby.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The frame just made the work something else
Wow Bobby you REALLY out did yourself. (Whatever that means).  Eather way it is fantastic. Thanks Tim
This is a masterpiece work of art from all the people who put in the work on the project. love it
its amazing
this makes me feel a lot like this one too and I don't know what to do with my life is a good thing to do with it but I don't think it will be a good day for me to get it to you tomorrow but I don't know what to do but I don't know what to do but I don't know what to do but I don't know what to do but I'm going back and I can do that but it is not a banana
You are AMAZING !!!!! <3 <3 <3
DUKE, BOY YOUR ART IS CRAAAAAZY.....LUV IT  !!!!
I'm glad I am not the only person who still uses MS Paint haha.
That frame.  Speechless.  I wish I had the money to buy this painting.  I'll have to enjoy it from afar.  Stunning job Booby, you've outdone yourself.
I just learned about this. Was there any update to the art? Did it get auctioned?  EDIT: Oh holy wait.. this was just posted 4 days ago! Looking forward to Peter's review!!
Respect
you need one of those vacum chambers like the dude who does... more or less the same shit as you XD
Excellent Bobby, the truth is that you are a genius in art, Your videos are not only good because we can appreciate your mastery in art, and in the use of different techniques, but also because of all the humorous content that you add to it. With all due respect, a warm hug from Uruguay!!!
Omg that frame Bobby!
the dedication this man puts in these vids is insane, amazing video as allways
Absolute special artist
The frame is the best part of this piece of artwork! Perfectly executed Bobby. Loved these last two videos
"also i'm lazy and disgusting." Same, Bobby. Same.
Bobby Duke you are Super Talented and Super Funny!
Bravooo
Chef's kiss
WOW! 🤩😍😎 That is such a beautiful frame and artwork in itself, along with the collab art. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼🎨💖
Sick frame 😍 it brings everything together! 💗💗💗
2:40 I skipped 10 seconds from this time stamp and never knew what was coming 😭
Where'd you get the fancy plastic sheeting?
So glad I followed Bobby duke and so glad to see a new video!!
2:22 -give me a second i-
I am living for the 10hun/Bobby crossovers 🙌
God i was waiting for this for so long!! this is my 3rd time watching this episode! LOVE THIS, LOVE YOU!! so worth the wait!
Dude this thing turned out so amazingly awesome! Super proud of you for everything you did. Those crystals were super crazy. The time it must've taken to make those alone was incredible. Only you could've done this. My wife and I love your videos. Keep them coming.
2:51 my fav part
Wow that looks amazing awesome job 👌👍😁
He said 🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟
Wow
This is so epic y’all are truly talented
i love you Dobby Buke!
Loves it ! Now let's brake it ..jp sick art bro
This was just perfect for the painting, it came out so stunning! Loved the choice of colors in the bubbles as well as that beautiful wood, it's incredible!!
Here’s on from my personal collection 😂
His wife is so lucky to have such awesome artwork all over their house!
Bobby, your video production quality is absolutely god-tier! Keep up the wonderful work, good sir.
I’m here for the drama
Super disappointing end to this project.  This is way too cringy to watch.   To each their own.  But ya big miss for me dawg
first of all, this frame is so beautiful! so impressive! how much does it weigh? secondly, it hurt my heart a little because it looked like you sprayed that gloss finish all over your rose bush:/ i’m a new to your channel & started following you when nerdforge & jazza did their part for this artwork! anyways so im not sure if you’ve said this but… is that fiddle leaf fig real??? if so, it’s so big & beautiful!
It looks awesome. You did a great job.
This is frickin AMAZING! 😍 Love it!
6:45 if you know, you know 👀
As a fellow artist... I understand the pain of being extra with my pieces.. this turned out beautiful. <3 you've always been a huge inspiration.
ahhh...no need for shrooms anymore
This is Epic.
i love your videos. The talking like a idiot thing is getting old though :(
8:40 my trypophobia
IN-SANE!
SICK
Sometimes I say "crooks and nannies" by accident
It's absolutely stunning! Never seen something like that!
I feel like this belongs in a meusuem. Also please be safe with the ice in texas!
Good God man. You are a genius. I cried.
Wewd
Very nice 👍🏽
I can't believe he actually went by the concept picture- like to the T. I usually make a concept sketch and I'm like ok time to wing it lmaoo 🤪
@4:18 also Glllooosy is the flloowers
@1:57 hahaha lol I want an infinity gif of that.
Wonder how much this piece will cost…
I want to know…. Bobby, did the devil leave you when you blowed those O’s of cleansing sage? 😮‍💨
somebody get this man a vacuum chamber.
Bobby duke makes me feel amazing about my art and the crazy art that he can make
I love the frame!!!
you have a pure soul
If there was anyone who could have pulled this off, well it's definitely you Mr Duke Arts
Your work on this is too awesome for words!! The entire project is simply FANTABULOUS!🎉🎉🎉 Kudos to Everyone who participated!!! Bobby... I can't say more about your dedication to your art and the LOVE you have for it... well done!!
Holy shitballs that is aMAzing!!! I want it so much. Too bad I can't afford to bid on it. I hope whoever wins the piece appreciates what a collaborative magnificence it is.
yhh its alright 🤷‍♂👍 aint subscribing tho
It was so awesome to see the final reveal! Totally never saw it in my head even after you showed your idea. But now that it's all come together, whole other VIBE! I love it! Awesome work :D
This is insane holy cow
You sir are a gentleman and a scholar...of the ministry of silly walks! Amazing work dukeman
i love this man so much
A Pick Of Destiny reference from the Wewd Man himself. Glory to this day
Grasshopper? Mosquito?  Idk why I'm laughing so hard at that
Круто, блин! Шикарная работа всех участников проекта!
THAT IS ONE SEXY PIECE OF ART
So stunning! The way everyone shines individually and also together as a group is so great. It's a symphony of cacophony! (Did I just name this legendary artwork? Haha)
Have you ever made a wewd fountain pen?? I know that's kinda lame in comparison to the rest of your art..but I wewd like to see how a wewden fountain pen wewd look made by you!
11:22 best moment
i love this guy's approach to art because it's less like an artist and more like an engineer's  it's as if a master architect of the 13th century suddenly decided he wanted to be an artist and doesnt know how to freehand so he put together a scientific theorem on how to "construct" art.
Bobby such a stud!
AGST Flaw is the song at the end in case anyone immediately fell in love with it like I did.
also This is THE MOST WHACK THING I've Ever Seen !!!!!  it's so rudiculous/weird it feels like total Nonesence . . whitch means: . "You Have Gone Too Far with this one"
You've done this to yourself. I want to donate. I really do. BUT. Every time I have some money. I BUY CRAFTING SUPPLIES! DAMN YOU BOBBY DUKE! I bought wewd through the mail! See. See what you've done to me. Oh and the frame is amazing!
why do these vids get more silly / stupid as time goes on ??  it is getting quite anoying :((
Beautiful.
beautiful and ideal for complementing the art itself with art
Bobby a mix of piss pants funny n extreme talent n hard work !  You're the man Bobby !
Oh my gosh Bobby u truly went crazy with this piece it's amazing !!!
Frame detracts from the actual art. It's hideous. I'm glad you're done being associated with this art endeavor because I've found your content exceptionally annoying with your fake accent and how you articulate. Good riddance, take care now. Won't be subscribing.
This artwork will go down in history !!!! <3<3<3<
"the con that is sili" that made me laugh so much :D
DID ANYONE ELSE GET THE 6:46 REFERENCE?!!
WOW!!! That was super cool!! You are an amazing talent Bobby Duke!!! Can you even put a price on that frame??? It's just gorgeous!! This piece is super epic with all the amazing talent that went into it!! The journey and all the different styles yet melding together was so beautiful!! Great job to all!! Congrats!! And the fact that it will go towards a good cause is truly heart warming!! @tenhundred you are such a blessing to all ❤
НАКОНЕЦ ТО Я ДОЛЖАЛСЯ ВЫПУСКА! 😊
Woooooow
ur wierd .......... i like it😜
Do a NFT of this! 😂😂 Amazing!
2:22 “just give me a second I, I need to get my story straight”
Funky, beautiful, intense.  Bravo, everyone!  That's an amazing piece of art and self-expression.
what a fitting, electrifying end to this inspiring collaboration. its fully sick i love it
I hope someday i will be just as good and passionated for art as you are. You did an amazing job - again! Thank you for sharing your hard work with us.
This is amazing. Everyone did an amazing job. This must feel so prideful getting to be apart of this. You matched the peice so well
the frame of the painting literally grabs the attention more than the painting itself! supurb!
You did it again.. Damn so beautiful..   😊👍
Absolutely beautiful work. Such attention to detail, sooooo impressive. Well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Took long enuf!!
Awesome frame. The best collab ever on youtube. Thanks to Ten Hun and all the others. You guys are amazing.
Why does Bobby feel like Bill nye of art in both content and video editing
I want
This is absolutely amazing! I love how all the crystals turned out, it’s really beautiful!!   I work with silicone and resins for a living, one of the reasons your dunk moulds didn’t cure (were gooey on the inside) is because some addition cure silicones are very picky and may not have liked the glossy spray paint you used or there was some thing on the crystal surface that it didn’t like, so it wouldn’t cure where it was touching (there are two types, addition cure and condensation cure and they each have their own pros and cons).  And when you’re pouring any resin please wear a respirator and use it in a well ventilated area as most resin fumes are really horrible to breathe in!  But I love your work so much and you really are an inspiration to me :)
6:45 Don't know if anyone got the reference but there is a guy with a bunch of Pixar themed fleshlights. The line right after this one is, "As far as i know it's the only one in exsitence."
i was thinking bobby duke stap away from the plates on the wall i repeate bobby duke stap away from the plates on the wall
I live near the wood shop. If you ever want a good place to eat in DFW I work at blue goose cantina. I’ve been following you for at least 2 years. Possibly more.
mommy duke arts
I keep hearing him say “raisins” instead of “resin”
bobby duke farts, i will never cease to be amazed by not only the beautiful art you make, but also your editing prowess. truly touching and uplifting.
wow it looks so amazing
I loooove this !!! It’s soooooo beautiful and it really fits the theme of the painting . Fab collab from allll of you !
Anyone know where that music he used for the end came from I want to listen to that on repeat
This is gorgeous! I've watched this twice now hahaha keep it up my dude.
Wow the frame turned out amazing. U did a amazing job. Love the Cristals.
You pronounce things abonormally. Got it. Formally requesting a new "schtick." Don't get me wrong, the frames end result is dope, but yeah....maybe some dialogue that's not beaten to death and less predictable would be nice.
suddenly, he was soldering some wires and the music changed.. 12:53
Your talent is truly amazing! Watching this painting come to life has been phenomenal and your frame is next level stunning!!! The artistry and skill involved to create such a masterpiece to showcase a masterpiece is beyond this world! Awesome!
Saw this just in time for my birthday, thanks so much Bobby duke arts!
Let me light up the runway with something from my personal collection 😈🥴🥴😂
So very epiclly and awesome! Amazing work Bobby and your wewd and crystals. I'm going to get some merch haha.
9:00 "is that stupid"
You are a big brain. Be proud of yourself I love watching you.
Where can I buy one or have it
I definitely heard “Shit more in less time” 😂  Also - as always LOVE when a BD video comes out!!! Love your work Bobby
That’s so dope. But good luck getting that level on a wall haha
It is actually ridiculous and insane how much talent you have. You are a gift to this world and I hope you never forget that.
Bobby duke arts is 100% my favorite YouTuber, and one of the only YouTubers that I would be glad to buy his merch and display it in my house, I see so much of myself in bobby duke and I live every second of your vids. Much love man.
Bobby's videos always feel like those "____ on CRACK" compilations people make, but it's like.. just how he is.
That's a good one TOY with arrow pointing towards DOKE 👏 😁
Bobby deserves sooo much recognition for the time, effort, silliness, & love he puts into his art. literally fuc***ng AMAZING.
Ayyo 💀 “personal Collection” ima need that ASAP 💳
HE thinks HE IS GOOD at procrastinating!!! I’ll have you know BOBY I am the the PROCASTINAKING!
That is epically awesome!!!! Your talent is so far beyond phenomenal!!!! Love everything you do bro!!! Wow!!
I like that your wearing ten                                          hun shirt
Wait! Noooo come back I need mooooore art!
Is the painting going back to 10hundred or will you keep it?
Beautiful job
This is absolutely INSANE. What an amazing accomplishment from all involved. I can't wait to see what happens with it next.
That came out sick
"Is it as thicc as that twerk" 🤣🤣🤣 this is the humor i live for!
Dagnammit Bobby...that's some fine work there. 😀
I usually don't comment much but I love this
Freakin Genius Bro this is an epic achievement from all who excelled on this project. More funky rock carving please. As always inspired cheers.
Finish the Chappel reference bobby 🤣🤣🤣
You are my son, Shelby's (6 11/12 yrs old (his words)) absolute hero. He loves your videos and spend half of this one cackling and laughing and the other half entranced.
WOW!!! Just AMAZING!!!!!!! All of the artists are very talented!!!! I could just sit and look at that for a while. That turned out really good.
Ten hundred shirt!
Coooooowelllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Real life NFT🔥
Genuinely interested. Why did you do it the way you did? Did you consider casting all the crystals in one piece was it too finicky doing it like that? And why did you resin instead of wood or some other material when making the moulds?
Wow..  100% worth the wait!
7:48 turtle milk is actually one of my favorites! if you milk your turtle right, the results can be really delicious! 😋
“Is that stupid?” No Bobby. It never is
Amazing work!
I made crystals for a project with tinted UV resin in a piss sample tube, knocked the blanks out then sanded flats onto them with belt sander, put LEDs under them and bish bash bosh awesome glowing crystals
Just....HOW?! How have you managed to harness your creativity like this? How are you able to pump out so much work? The artistry, the perfection, just HOW?! Absolutely amazing piece. 🖤💜🌌🌠🔮💎
I'm also a hyper perfectionist when it comes to art. It takes me like 20 minutes to draw a simple shape the way I want
GAWD DAMN BOBBY!! It's INCREDIBLE! You're frame elevated the rest of the piece. I'm, as a loss for further words. Just, WOW.
Was he saying ShipStation or something else
DUDE! Where did you get that dichroic plastic from?
Yeah, get some twerking lessons from your dad. Great job from all involved!
Holy cow! I can’t believe how beautiful it came out. Like, I had a feeling you would impress me but I wasn’t aware of that level until now. I hope you know that you are so amazing and talented and I know you struggle with mental health issues but you are really talented okay? Whenever you don’t think so, I’m telling you that you are. I’m sure you have people tell you also but it’s like applause, the more the better. I’m proud of you.
So beautiful
You're INSANE! ;) I LOVE IT! :D And OMG, your videos are an ADHD brain's idea of paradise... Now shush, I'm busy drooling in dopamine watching a dude making his ass dance to a retro synth beat. 😮💨
6:46 bruh I cannot believe he used that clip 😂
You outdid yourself on this one!  Your process for making those crystals was a sight to behold.  It's impressive how much you get done even with the all too relatable procrastination breaks!
If there is an artist on TikTok that deserves to have made it, it’s Bobby.  I remember watching his Majoras Mask video years ago and thinking “if he sticks to this, he’ll make it to the top.”  I’m glad he stuck with it! 💪
Glad to see ya back. You one of the goats. Straight killing it with that frame.
I gotta say, that edit at 4:00 was clean as hecc, really nicely done
hey bobby can you do a short vid about what those plates are and what makes them special enough to put on your wall are they the kind of plates you see on antiques roadshow worth 10k +
I love pick of destiny <3 and I love your frame <3
Bobby's da man!
Bobby:" I made a thing, now I'm going to sleep for the next two weeks".
Awesome!! Such a cool concept !
2:21 is that looping footage?
I was such a great journey to watch the artists paint it......BUTT!!!!  You are so FREAKING talented and that frame is beyond epic!
4:28 same
YOUR STILL UPLOADING
it's beautiful!
Now THIS is how you do an art collab
2:22 I really thought you were going to burst out into a musical number or something :") but daaang! This look insane!
THAT CRYSTAL STOP MOTION WAS EPIC AND WORTH IT
Oh hey, cool.
lesgo
What did u put inside the crystals?
MS ppppp PAINT!!!!   Heresy
The amount of work that has went into this whole thing, it’s going to be worth a mint. But...whoever is able to pay that mint is going to be one lucky wee💩!🥴😂Because...look at it! It’s absolutely stunning! They get to have that!😩Well done to all who took part! It’s gorgeous!🤩🥰👏👌
"not only so they feel superior"🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or does he sometimes sound like dub Frieza
The procrastination part is so relatable
This is beyond perfect 👍🏻
So awesome!!!  Thank you to all the artists who have shared this amazing series with us
It's finally finished, this is a historical moment
That was so worth the wait!!!
Beautiful

hello
3:37 just putting this here to show appreciation for this part that was over in seconds but no doubt took hours to make :0
my god this guy is just so talented, and if people complain about how long his vids take are just not understanding the length he goes too, he did this 3:37 for what a few smiles and chuckles out of people, he makes his vids pleasing and fun to watch so god knows how long he did all this just to make stop motion with all these tiny parts .   keep up the good work Dukie and hope your well, your a massive inspiration to me and others from around the world   ~Cameron from the Uk
Production Value took another level in this video
Bobby went super hard on this! I love iT!
Nice

Amazing , Wonderful ... as usual piece of art ... WOW 🤩🤩🤩 Thank you so much for being such inspiration to the Art World  🤍
Not only is anything you make amazingly done, but it's worth watching just for ur dad silliness! Not many people can pull of trying to be funny, but u pull it off every damn time. Fuck this channel is GOLD! 😃🤣
Wow, the time and effort you put into this. It looks amazing. It's almost as if no painting is worthy of that frame.
I’m procrastinating watching you procrastinate, hmmm?! WeWd! But seriously cant wait (I hate waiting) for the next project Bobby. You’re awesome and a true inspiration. Thank you for sharing.
Amazing. The amount of work you put in every little detail is incredible. I'm in awe of how beautiful the frame is. The editing is insane and I love your sense of humor
Anyone else not get a notification for this??
The best part of that art piece is the frame and I'm not afraid to say it.
You silly-cone he he he he
The sheer amount of crazy and awesome in this video is astounding
Tenacious D rocks!🤘🏼
I've been waiting for ages, and now.. it's here! Man, that was reeaaaally awesome
07:48 those google searches were the funniest part of the series
Wow. You are still crazy,and that is an crazy amazing frame!!! So impressed over all the work you and the others out into this world traveling picture/frame.
Your attention to detail is astounding! Your creativity is out of this world! Your personality is crazy. I am absolutely blown away at your contribution to the art project.
Creative genius!!!
That was dope af 👌🏾
Damnnnn
Gorgeous! Wow.
What was the art piece from because I saw draw with jazza
Bobby Duke, you are a master of your craft
Frame reveal song?
Sometimes i wish we could comment on specific parts of the video, like on soundcloud, because Bobby drops A LOT OF GEMS  This dude not only makes physical art, he does digital audiovisual art.  Damn.... I'm keeping this video on my watch later playlist to watch it on the tv. AMAZINGLY INSANE, SO SHINY
Holey sheets that looks B-E-YOU-TIFUL 😍 Well done, everyone!
The frame turned out amazing!  The way the dark wood contrasts so well with the reflecting colors in the resin, and just compliments the whole piece in general is stunning!👁👄👁
All through both the videos I kept forgetting that it was supposed to be a frame and just started glaring at Bobby's work in appreciation and awe. I honestly think he's on of the people I admire the most on the internet. You the man of the wewd my guy, peace and love from Brazil. <3
I love that not only are you making art, but you are making art to show your process at making art!! Your videos are beautifully edited and you put so much work into making them exactly what you want, I love the videos AND the art!!!!
1:56 stop it Bobby you're making me blush
Fanboytasticlyamazing oooh you guys make YouTube so cool I feel young again.
Ok Who else laughed really hard at the fart sound?
more patrick!
The editing and attention to detail here...wow
Bobby please give me this  .... Im in so love with this masterpiece 😭
I like the beard.
Wow. That is one hell of a frame. I don't know which is better the artwork or the frame.
So dope
Bobby this is absolutely incredible! You are amazing!!
This made me miss making jewelry with resin and holo cellophane! I forget how beautiful it can be.  Your work is stunning as usual!
It feels a combination of amazement and sad that this art collab is finally over. But we felt so blessed witnessing all your efforts and talents put together for an awesome+magnificent work of masterpiece. Thank you guys ❤️
One of the most talented and funniest people ever!
What did he keep chucking at the wall?
I like that you still use MS Paint 🎨
Did you think of a name for the piece? Maybe every artist that worked on it could come up with part of the name so as to make it an ULTIMATE collective creation.
ijust finished watching the playlist, even subbed to a couple of the creators, but after this video ended.....why is there a video about the 9 levels of hell. i mean, i always thought that dantes inferno would make a great comic or piece of art or something....i just didnt expect to see it in the playlist. i watched the full thing.
I personally like the frame better than the picture.
The only YouTuber whose videos keep me riveted from start to finish! The frame took my breath away!!!!!!! (Nice twerking by the way lmaooo)
You are amazing sir
I love you too Bobby.
The editing of this video is insane!! The art itself is so impressive but the amount of time and effort the editing would have taken brings it to the next level!
Bobby, please wear a respirator when working with resin and spray can things D: I want your lungs to survive.  For your health and my peace of mind.
You should make the main knife from red dead redemption 2
Hey Bobby, got an idea for you. You ever heard of a Infinity cube? I would very much like to see you try to make one of these. Like I said just an idea. Love your work, keep it up
That frame is gorgeous!! I'm in love with those crystals!💕
Now donate the picture to the clever art museum 🤣 haha but all jokes aside I love this it has given me ideas.
I want that
How the hell did you ship that?
Master piece
Gee bobby I never knew you worked with Jazza!
Let's appreciate the insane stop motion work in this vid cause it's deserve appreciation. that was 🔥🔥
The finish game me goosebumps I been waiting for a while for the finish and finally seeing was way past my expectations. Props to all the artist who put this together. 🙏🙏🙏
No, I love YOU! Brilliant work mah dude! Lucky is the person who gets to put that on their walls...
EPIC! and such fun to watch. You are a great person Bobby, thank you!
Holy smokes man the sheer effort! This is amazing……sooooo gooood!!!! Awesome

that looks seriously unreal. I love it!!
A stunning piece! incredible creators and artists working to make a master piece of their imaginations. Well done!
Wow! Maximum Bobbytude! Hats off, good sir.

man turns into freaza for a bit 5:23
BOBBY! Bobby Bobbeee Bawbeee! Legit UH-MAY‐ZING!! Best collab I've seen ANYWHERE so far. It's just beautiful!
I stopped watching your channel for two years mainly due to memories I had with my grandparents watching your content until I decided to cut them of my life, I’m glad you are the same, even better and funnier, talented I love your works so much thank you
Обожаю родственные души😁😁😁
What's the song in the end
Did he do a Dolly Zoom? This guy is insane.
WOW! I am blown away. This project has been an epic journey to follow. So many talented artists and I am so inspired by all 🤩🤩🤩🙌🙌🙌
soooo much plastic in one video.. 😖
That's so cool! :D
gay
AMAZING! Been with this piece since the beginning and, I have to say, you have done the most incredible work!!!
Sooo amazing!!!
complimenti e bellissimo
lol how many times did bobby have to film twerking?
El Dudarino!  Can you make the "Dwarven Sphere" Robot from Skyrim? There is not a shingle soul who made it (not properly anyways).  Even if you don't - thanks for all the videos! You're AWESOME!
sen bir efsanesin ,muhteşemsin dostum.Türkiyeden selamlar...
Bobby, you handle that clay like a really experienced clay handler who has obviously handled a LOT of clay.
Got out of surgery for my mouth today and now I'm laying in bed watching your videos, Bobby, to pass the time. I've watched your videos for quite some time, and I'm glad to have your art and your humor as a nice way to relax and heal up. Thank you!
Holy heckers, this is AMAZEBALLS! :D I've never seen such a marvelous creation of a frame before! Well done, it fits the painting like .... ehh... [insert something really fitting] <3
the final reveal was awesome👍
It has been awesome watching you the past couple years and seeing how you have progressed as an artist. I am so happy with all you have accomplished! BTW, your wife kicks ass!
The final result gave me goosebumps.. You finished the piece perfectly! And I love your editing style :D
Damn! 🤯
11:33
holy shit, that is the sickest thing I've ever seen. i audibly gasped when it lit up
i am in love with this piece
4:55 The most relatable thing he's ever said
Bobby, I f*¢{‰g love you… I could literally hear👂a magical enchantment from the crystals✨.   Your projects are always a FULL SEND with  honest emotions captured.  We, your fellow procrastinators salute you!!!
Thank you for this video, it is the best look into the mind of someone with ADHD I have ever seen. : ) Seriously your art is amazing and I appreciate the special gifts you have to make it.
11:20 HOW!!? 😂 haha — gawgeous work !!! 🧡
6:46 That reference caught me off guard 🤣🤣
To anyone wondering what's the reveal music is  its  Flaw - AGST
That is Ah-MAZ-ing!!
Well done duke I hope that art work will one day reach in art gallery’s and the other artist did awesome as well and I think this is the best art work u have done in all of ur art work ☺️👋
What a loving thoughtful frame for a piece of art that had just as much love put into it!
Lol no wonder this video took ages to come out. He was doing Stop motion with the crystal pieces 😂
That looks absolutely amazing 🤩
I was wondering what was taking him so long, now I know.
When u had to wait for part 2 for not very long............
That was *AMAZING* ! The artwork was great and the effort put on making this video was also great. Enjoyed watching it so much.
holy shiyza, my brain hurts just from thinking about how the phug you edited this. I mean i've heard of editing as you go ''ooh maybe i'll stick a jumpcut here, maybe a little special effect there'' but this is like a whole nuther level.
I can't sanction your buffoonery, but there's no denying your incredible artistic talent. Your work is truly second to none. The frame came out beautifully.
This piece was amazing to watch.....so many talent artists, that came together for one beautiful piece art! Thanks to all of the artists that contributed ...the frame was definitely the icing!!! 👌🏽
That is amazing!
2:17 i was about to sing call me maybe at 2am
I see you have GREAT taste in music my friend 7:12 🌀👁
Now that's how a calab is done  with an epic ending
One day I'll get a minute into a video without smiling/laughing. Although, I hope that day never comes.
Cara, você é meu youtuber favorito e minha maior inspiração para a arte e para criação de vídeos. Poste mais vídeos Bobby, tu é um gênio que faz meus dias mais divertidos e motivados. Muito obrigado!
Bobby its unbelievable! seriously man, your work stands, it simply rocks!
Pure electric goosebumps when that beat hit at the end with the big reveal! What an epic frame and what a crazy journey this has been! Can’t wait to see it in person
Being a perfectionist is painful but holy mother of cake you're on another level Mr. Duke, and so are your creations 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗 beautiful
🔥💕😍👌👍
Admittedly a bit sad when I would check back within the weeks leading up to see if he finished the frame, and nothing. This made up for it and some. Glad I found this wewd content and creator.
Holy Macaroni, this project is amazing. All the editing and stop motion segments are insane! The final frame looks so cool and tasty!
Absolutely amazing work, Duke, you rock.
Just one word…….. SENSATIONAL 🤩
Fookin' Fookin' AM-FOOKIN'-AZING! Congratulations to you and all.
This looks mental though
Those crystals are crazy gorgeous and I really just want the frame, cuz, damn. I kept waiting the whole time for some 3D, some resin and electricity and you delivered it all!!! You're a trip with your word pronunciations makes me smile
Hi
Love love love it!!! This video is on another level and the finished fram is awesome😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 thanks for this video❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
reppin 10hun!!!
Silicon: The cone that is silly :D 6:29
Cool your dog =))))
Even this video was a work of art! 👏👏👏
Worlds most valuable frame? Might be, but I know for sure that it is the worlds most badass frame! Amazing.
holy fuckeroni I am speechless. This is incredibly beautiful. 😱🖤
It's amazing...Goosebumps..!!!!
When you turned the light on, with the frame assembled and displayed?  I audibly gasped, think I woke someone!
2:33 Love music drops like this! 😎
Bobby I love that u do art but I absolutely love that u do different kinds of art like sculpting drawing painting carving like u do it all and u do it all great
I think the frame is almost better then the art itself - good job! At first I was like.. how will this look? I couldn't wait to see what u came up with, the challenge was finding something cohesive and u nailed it
Me replaying 2:29 over and over to hear wewd.
This has got to be the absolute most gorgeous piece of artwork I've seen, because it is absolutely the perfect finishing touches this needed. I am speechless!
Dude you should put all your arts in a museum !! Love all your works of art. Keep going forward. I wewd that!
Grasshopper mosquito lol
You should make some “ hey guys it’s ff done ” merch
It is not lost on me how damn long that stop motion shot of the crystals must have taken to make. Geez.
Freaking awesome!! Another masterpiece. ❤️
I caught Covid a few days ago and right now I’m going through the worst part when u have all the symptoms but this really made me feel better. I got a much needed laugh out of this video.
Phenomenal! ⭐
"It's Dookie Time" You could make anything and we'll love watching you create. You are so funny, I laugh so hard.  Glad you put these videos out, always anxious to see each one.
FINALLY!!!!!!!  I've waited since LAST YEAR to see part two!  Well worth the multi-year-spanning wait, I might add. ;)  I'm always amazed not only by your artistic skill, but also your improving video editing and strategic placement of fart sounds. Don't ever change, you big weirdo.
Congratulations on making the top 30 trending, Sir Master Doctor Professor Robert Dukington, first of your name! Have you thought about doing anything with recycled plastic? Number 2 plastic is apparently pretty simple to melt down in an oven without creating toxic fumes.
Not me thinking he said shit more in less time..
The last was blast💥🔥.
I love you too Bobby Duke! 😭😭😭 Epock Fram! Angelic float to reveal.. was perfection. A Stunning conclusion to ultimate collaboration. But, who gets to keep this?
Hey Bobby! I don’t normally comment on videos but I just wanted to stop by and say I loved this video and frankly I Love all your videos. I appreciate your craft and all the effort you put in. I am a carpenter/framer and your attention to detail and incessant need for perfection encourages me to build better everyday! Keep being you, because when you are you it’s the best version of you!
:O Wow that frame looks amazingggg! It really tops off the whole piece
the round crystal moulds trigger my trypophobia but this is so cool!! 😭😩
The greatest collab on YouTube is finally done. It looks amazing ❤️❤️
This is phenomenal! Well done Bobby and all the other artists! Brilliant work
Uh-friggin’-maize-bawls! Without a doubt, _turtle-tutorial-2016-Bobby_ would be suuper impressed!!   Can’t wait to see what u do next!!  I’m hoping to see more Wewdworking!  I always get hyped on hilarity whenever u put out an upload which shows u *Gittin’ Weird Wit Wewd!* <[merch idea?]
Bro that's nuckin futs Great job👍
Yeeeeeaaaaaaeee !😌
All y'all the  most beautiful mfs ever.  Thank you for this!!!!
I absolutely love apoxie sculpt for crafting  and probably won't go back to any other air dry clay unless a specific project MMMMUUST call for it. It is pretty expensive but SO WORTH IT BRO
Mad Fucking Genius', one and all....EPIC
Wow the frame looks amazing. I had no idea it took so much work to make this happen. Thanks for showing us your process👍
Laughed hard and had a big cheesy smile the whole video amazing all around
I'd love to take part in something like this, but I have very little patience for crafts and most of my work is digital.
Every time i think bobby is a man of culture he comes out with another quote
0:27 that is just how i feel at all moments
You are so hardcore. lol
Absolutely awesome!!!!!
THE EDITING, THE TIME!!!!!
You are amazing.
This video and artwork was already fantastic, then the Princess Bride scene made it even better! Awesome work!
Antisepticeye? Old news. Darkiplier, who? Bobby Spook is here to stay.
Bobby is the best. He always makes me laugh when i need it most.
Love it!!!
Twerking hard or hardly twerking killed me lol
Simply the most epic piece of artwork ever! I have thoroughly enjoyed the journey! Congrats to all who collaborated!
Trypophobia trigger warning at 6:54 and again at 8:36
That frame is amazeflazeballs ☄️💎☄️💎
Pretty
NOBODY could do this better than our legendary artist "Bobby Duke" 👏👏👍
“All the crystals encased within the cone that is silly” LMFAO THAT KILLED ME
Dude that frame turned out amazing! It compliments the picture so well. Absolutely incredible.
Whats the song at 11:20? I need it in my life!
Baby got back
The perfect frame 🤩
Your humour is broken and we love it😂
Your “twerk” looks suspiciously like a Filipino dance called the Otso otso
finally.
LoL
You're at 2021 this is a day ago Then you should have wrote 2022
Yes yes yes the frame is nice and all but that vine reference was truly impressive
Wewd
GUWD WUWD
This is truly amazing. What a piece of art - the frame is a perfect match to the other artists’ works. This video was hella fun!
Idk if I'm wrong but his video feels like watching PewDiePie
Absolutely stunning work sir! I tip my hat to you!
I laughed so hard!!!😂 11:33
14:02 - what's with the piece of tape on it?
Okay, Bobby. At about minute 12 there is a portable belt sander on its side that you are sanding with.....and there is a metallic nozzle attached to a yellow handle - what the heck is it ?! Is it air pressure blowing dust away, maybe ?!
This is absolutely stunning! I've never wanted a picture frame more in my life! All of the artwork in the painting and the amazing frame you did go together beautifully. It makes my heart happy to see people work together to create such an astonishing masterpiece.
Well done everybody, well done.
are the crystals you make buyable? My daughter would like to have a few
You taped, tickled, turned, twisted, and tinkered that one but good, Tex!!   The power of rat fink is deep in you, sir..LOL
Bobby, I'll teach you how to properly twerk!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
All I am going to say is...."I WANT THAT!!!"
Bro! Cheese and Rice, that is awesome!!! Bobby, you rock my face off!!
Holy HECK, the amount of skill in one areas creating a COLLAPSE in reality it self!
Great job! Bobby, sometimes you really amaze yourself!
In 20 yrs that’s gonna be in a museum like Picasso’s pieces
Awesome where is it Now??
omg the editing is fire!!! the stop-motion is so smooth!! and the result is gorgeous
Bobbyyy. You trending! Yesss!!
that is absolutely stunning :O i need it !
No words…..other than amazing!!!!!!
The epoxy slaps harder than my dad's belt
Those crystals are, of course, the rare and precious Dukite.
Speechless.
Im always so excited to watch your videos because of the fact that they are hilarious 😆
I felt that time lost procrastinating in my soul.   The Wind-Up to Do The Hard Thing. Amazing job, you should feel super proud of yourself!
10:14 This is not the best frame in the world, this is a tribute!
Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion to join,god loves all and forgives all, god can help you through what ever you are going through,you just have to believe,be safe everyone,have a nice day,i hope you have a good day..
This adventure was epic! 😍
That crystal stopmotion would have taken so long! Way cool!
WOW!! I knew you would do an incredible job, but this blew all of my expectations! Beautiful work Bobby! ❤️
Beautiful addition to that amazing piece of art!!! Always blown away by your art Mr. Duke!!!
Oh wow that is so so so beautiful! It‘s perfect!
Wow absolutely amazing. Really a one of a kind piece of art.
Breathtaking. It's so beautiful. So well executed. Stands alone on its own merits and yet enhances the artwork itself. I'm in awe. Congrats Bobby.
Holy actual crap this is my new favourite!!
Was that stop motion with the crystals ??! Damn
Looks awesome... but i wouldnt pay over 2 million dollar for it.
Beyond amazing! Just wow.
I absolutely love your energy, art and video editing... Best YouTuber I'm subbed to
Oleeeeee🙌🏼✨
This bloke do be making the most perfect of things
🤯🤯🤯
That is one epic frame!
This is so incredible! You never fail to amaze and inspire me! Such a beautiful collaboration 😩🖤
Making each crystal must have been so tedious. Wow.
It looks awesome!!!!
absolutely amazing
The attention to detail here was soooo enjoyable to watch, and the end result just takes this piece to a whole different level. I can't believe how cool this is hahahah, thanks for doing it WAY MORE than justice!! So proud and happy to have been a part of this
Love it! 🥰🥰
OH my god.  The amount of effort just for the crystal building montage is amazing!
The art is wonderful but that frame! The frame is the best part! Great job!
Wow… just WOW 🤩
So awesome
What is the putty resin you used? Please let me know as you don’t have a link for it.  Thanks Bobby 😀👍
3:37 I know how hard stop motion is, nice job!
Amazing!!!!!! So beautiful I feel a bit teary-eyed 🥲😍
It was worth every second of waiting.  You can just upload one video a year and It ALWAYS delivers.  An amazing piece!
Daaaaaamn! That's amazing!
Love it 😍😍😍
I’ll take it!
The most beautiful frame ever made 🧮🪚🔨👏👏
Stop the cap this ain’t the most valuable
It is impossible to hate Bobby and these are some if not the most entertaining videos ever
Looks awesome!
Man, I don’t know what I love the most about this channel…. The arts or the humor. Awesome content😃
The time and effort this man puts into his videos is absolutely astounding, and I can't express properly how happy he makes me with every friggin' project he chooses to make a video on.
People don't realize how hard it is to do that stop motion! The amount of work this guy puts into work is unreal!
this is sooooo cool! hahaha, this is by far the craziest artwork I have seen so far, every single artist put so much energy and effort in it. Damn, you nailed it with the crystals at the end! Really dope! It was a little bit painful to see you sawing the artwork and drilling a hole in it, but the light is like the cherry on the cake! So dope!
Dude.... despite the fact that you may possibly be crazy, you are a brilliant artist
This is SO COOL OMG YOURE AMAZING!!! It’s awesome to see how much effort you put into not only the art piece, but also the production of your videos!! Incredible all around❤️❤️
Oh Shot, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! My eyes watered not even kidding 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
i feel your hard work 😂✌🏻
I was so happy when this video got recommended to me
Really well done, love that it looks awesome but not overwhelming all the other art
bobby you've outdone yourself
That “twerk” was just a straight up back workout 🤣smh
Craftsmanship 👍👍
Awesome and inspiring!
9:47 Nicole's joke made me laugh so good! Love when she's featured in your videos because I love how you two joke around
“It’s really hard, I don’t know wot to- it not like plastic or wewd”  That’s what she said
Beautful
Sometimes I feel like a like and comment can not express enough how I appreciate all the work, creativity, humour, and genius level editing.. I wish there was a booster button when video's are absolute exceptional...
This is the best thing ever! All artists are fantastic! Love this collab
Nicely done! Like the way that shiny plastic looks inside the resin :D
When you described how you were going to make the crystal mold, I said aloud "...No. No. Surely not."   You are a living testament to the power of adhd hyperfocus
Can't believe its at 43k likes and not a single dislike!!
Martina will love this...
shut up and take my fu***ing money!!
Fuuuuk  that  cool crystals o_o
You nailed it!
How minimalistic and discreet  💎 I WANT THAT 💎
Amazing work , really made it come together, loved the proces and kinda hoped it would end up with you. Just amazing. Epic release video, good job
I love it so much!!!😍🤩👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Whaaaat?! Holly F this looks amazing now!!!
AMAZING end to an amazing collaboration!
Oh my holy bjezuz that's ***************************************** and so ********************************** amazing looking..
What’s the finale song at the end that shit was dope
I love all the love given in this project and how everyone gives credits when it's due  no need to talk about the passion and talent of every artist that participated in it  thank you trn Hundred for giving us this beautiful project and Bobby for the hard work omg the time spent on that frame 🤯 the results 😍😍
That stop motion bit was cool!
Oh my goodness, Dukey, you're #21 on trending!! I've been subscribed for 3 years and have never seen that before. Congrats!!  ...4 years actually Also, wewd
Holy eff balls batman. That frame is bloody amazing. I wish I had the cash for materials & set up to make stuff like that. So effing pretty man. Ps love all your silly edits & stop motion bits.
love how during the ad, every time he says Ship, it sounds like S**t, love the molds, though. This helps me find a way to make crystals for my artwork too! Keep being a perfectionist to help us small-minded peeps make big-minded artwork like yours!
Love your art and videos Bobby 🤘🏻😍
Just one word EPIC !💜
I feel like this is the type of thing a pirate would hoard-- Sir Bobby Duke this is indeed the bootiest of booty. Bravo!
You are the best artist on youtube that I know of, I have been following you since the very beginning and I admire everything about you from your original ideas to your meticulous executions to your editing skills and your one of a kind personality . Keep it up and good luck in your future projects. I wish you all the best
My grandma said baby where can I but this, that’s how you know this guy is a legend ❤️
See, if it was me I would have just bought the crystals.  I think that is one reason you have 4.43M subscribers and I don't have a Youtube channel.
Best collab ever, since chocolate and peanut butter!!! Everyone is so talented!
this whole thing, painting(s) & frame, looks so f'ing cool - i love it sm !!
That´s Mr Beasts´ dad right?
Why isn't there a reaction video from the paint artists? I bet Jazza got reaaaally jelousy that he wasn't the one playing with resign. lol
Over 2,300 comments after 20 hours? Sure, I'll add one too... why not? For everyone who impatiently bellyached while waiting for Bobby Duke to finish the frame... uh me included... might I ask for a collective mea culpa? Not since Noah was provided a football to spike in the form of rain, have so many proved so wrong. After the same question, "Why is it taking so long to make a £*#$%&! frame?" was collectively asked for months on end, we finally have our answer. He wasn't making a frame. He was creating an art piece worthy of containing such an epic painting. As each artist added their signature vision, the character and scope of the artwork expanded exponentially until the only thing that could possibly contain it was what Bobby Duke conceived of, drew, and then painstakingly crafted into reality. To paraphrase Gandalf, "An artist is never late, nor is he early, he finishes precisely when he means to." Bravo!!! I can hardly wait for the next chapter in this art saga... hopefully not too long.
The recap was a perfect refresher
Organic gemstones that are found in the ocean are coral, calcite, aragonite, and pearls. They are created by animals – mainly corals and mollusks.
Fantastic work the frame finishes the painting off perfectly.
Art projects just don't get better than this, Awesome!!!
6:45 BOBBY PLEASE-
"I promise you won't have to wait long for part 2" 👀
Mental illness is no joke. Are you sure that you can be trusted around tools?
DUDE that looks absolutely incredible! I love how the colors and materials shine in your frame contribution, but don't detract or feel disjointed from the rest of the piece. Excellent job, and excellent artistic contribution!
Duuuuuuuude, that is so awesome!  Or dewd?
That as* 😘
Silly cone: “🤪🍦”
I love you n your content, its funny and goofy AND super beautiful interesting and impressive art.
Now i fully understand that it's the way that matters and give you satisfaction, not the result alone. Which is fantastic a.f. but you couldn't be this dedicated and be that precise when you don't have fun doing stuff. Thanks to Bobby and his lovely wife nicole the duchess and to All the artists involved!!!
just one word... FLAWLESS... I''m following this art piece and the last but not least must to be Bobby! A M A Z I N G! Looking foward to the auction.
9:00 looks like a cat throwing up
No twerk for you!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ja assisti 3x esse vídeo!!!! Awsome!!! Vc é muito engraçado!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What an A M A Z I N G. result you artists produced. Bobby Duke as always crazy good in both your wewd art, as your video skills. Lots of love from the Netherlands 👏👍
Your narration is why I subscribed. Congratulations. And thank you.
This is so INCREDIBLY COOL
Woah this is most beautiful and coolest frame ive ever seen, the time and effort put into that👏 great job!
Every time I see them, Im jealous of the plates and how they’re out on the wall. It’s so beautiful and artistic.
Beautiful
This is so awesome, I'm lost for words!
You did a good job making the frame blend beautiful with the centerpiece(is that what it’s called?), it looks awesome ✨
You amaze me
Sir bobbert of the dukey do you have a 2nd channel of you doing zee shanaynays between your vids? If not WEEEE DE PEEPELS NEEDS MOREEEE DUKEY
Absolutely INCREDIBLE JOB TO ALL THE ARTISTS!! I’ve followed the trail of artists, and watched some creators I loved like Nerdforge and finding DOPE new (to me) creators like freaking BOBBY DUKE!!! SUCH an awesome job, everyone. And that is the sickest frame I have EVER SEEN! I want those crystals littering my ceiling.
EPIC

😂😂 & 🤩🤩
THOROUGHLY impressed! Well done, my man. This thing is epic.
Hola!! 🌞 I'm an artist from Colombia, since today I know your Youtube channel. What an incredible manual work, editing, humor, processes. The stop motion was brutal. I congratulate you for your great work and quality..
you are amazing and an inspiration. grettings from argentina.
You did amazing artwork! It’s perfect! Oww, sorry, it’s buttfect ✨
I laughed soo hard when he started pooping the crystaals out of the molds.
Keep up the beautiful work!  I love every video!
This turned out sooooooooooooooooooooooooo sick!! Frame was a perfect final touch 👌
This gave me the chills. All of the artists involved are great at what they do. I'm glad to see Graffiti artists like Doke and Smoe involved as well. I've been subbed to almost every channel included in this project for about 2 years now
I have been having a particularly hard day today. My depression is high and the inner monologue is loud and mean... But seeing you be... well ✨you✨ just absolutely made my day. Thank you, Dukey.
I would be incredibly nervous to accidentally ruin a project that has been through all of those hands.
That's amazing🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩
Hey Bobbyduke how is it going with quitting smoking 🚭
without a doubt my favorite youtuber, one of my favorite since i started watching in 2007
Bobby you did so good
Bobby Duke clearly has ADHD. Which… Goes to show that even if you live that life, you can make unique and amazing work even with that.
Amazing!! I’m so happy to see the finished piece! I watched nerdforge’s video when Martina painted her side. I love your videos. You are my favorite artist. I giggle the entire time watching your videos.
How much is mona lisa worth it? Double that and it may be close to what this painting is worth it
I'm amazed that how much this guy is hard working, I mean look video editing skill + art skill he's really talented ❤❤
When you launched the crystals out of the molds with the air nozzle I lost it.haha.😅 Also, what is that wood and brass tool you had on the bench toward the beginning of the video?
Love it ❤️
My gawd. IT IS SO FRACTURING BOOTIFOOL!!!  Now just imagine in the next few dozens of years this wonder 's being auctioned off and the person with the winning bid wants it without the frame. :O
I will own this. Thanks Bob
ive been waiting for this for so long and i love it !
i love
yoy
This turned out amazing. I'm really glad you got to finish this awesome atrwork! The frame really brings the whole piece together very well.
You forgot to skip part2 how love part 2
Long video just for nothing didnt finished
Insane and amazing! Congratulations to everyone involved in making this astonishing work of art!
Salute to Every artist who was part of this wonderful project ♥️
He swapped the caps... THE RESIN CAPS
...it's very important to use the right sillycone...! 😅
Wow, you are a perfectionist! Love your fun content. You make me laugh. You so crazy!
Can we also talk about the artistry of the video? You did so many amazing edits. The stop motion, the clean up green screen, the jumping flying scene, etc. etc. Not only was the art of the frame amazing, but the video was a joy to watch as well. Great editing and great frame!
Did you just fart in my direction... How very dare Nah that was funny! Did you just fart in front of my Wife... Sorry I didn't know it was her turn :) Awesome job by all involved, thanks for taking me on the journey! TFS, GB :)
Gimmi the gimmick.. 🥰🥰
4:48 This is me with everything
*Bjord*
Thats a very nice vinyl copy of Lateralus you have in your office there Bobby.
How amazing are all these talented people wow what a journey this was and the end so extra thick! Thicker than the twerk. Bravo 👏👏 and geniously entertaining
That's a truly awesome frame, Dorky!  Wow.  Great job.
dayum
Awesome work Bobby Duke. You are a legend. I am buying a wewd shirt immediately
I’m not gonna lie that reveal made me cry… For two reasons.  One because it’s gorgeous, it’s so beautiful and so much work. I saw it and tears were streaming down my face.  Two because I know what it’s like to be that kind of a perfectionist and the amount of mental strain and hell that you put yourself through to get to that point and still feel like you could’ve done more. But I think that you are one of the most incredible artists, But never feel like you have to one up yourself all the time everything you do has been nothing short of a labor of love.
can you make a naruto in god mode
Woah what a fantastic job, you really are amazing, hope to see more of your video's this year
Actually no joke one of the coolest art pieces I’ve ever seen. I hope it gets a fortune for charity. Cause it surly looks priceless.
Dude it is ridiculous how good you are at art and creativity Totally awesome, sick and dope stuff I say
9:01 breaking news, quirked up bobby busts it down, sexual style
Watching Bobby struggle with his adhd is such a mood. Bobby, if you read this, you aren't lazy and disgusting for not being able to beat the adhd paralysis and executive dysfunction! Love you!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.                       .-.-.-
Bobby Duke, the little frame that keeps the world sane, with beautiful things........
Number 1 reason I watch your videos: you are crazy nutty funny! Second reason: your talent and creativity is stella! I totally swooned over the reveal of the crystals. Awesome! 😁❤️
i wonder if it would have been easier (and cheaper) to make the crystal sculpts out of air dry clay or so, but it still looks amazing
That thing is amazing and no other words for it
That's just awesome 👌   👀  Love they way you, pulled the page of your current scene n transition into another scene just like in the cartoons  😂
11:22 😂😂😂
I'm looking in the description and can't find the part 2?
I think it is going to be an auction correct? I got three grand ready to drop on that so people better be ready to bid 😊
Epic...
No idea why, but “Crooks and Nannies” is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard
WoW! that is some Nedrforge Shit right there dude! Looks cool as ...ice?
This belongs in a museum
I never thought that throwing something into a corner could be so funny
Bobby never fails to impress, entertain or amaze
Amazing!!
I love watching this man when I’m down with a touch of sad, or a case of Dey blews. We need a Bobby Duke SSRI. And then all the world is right woance again.
Omg it's beautiful!
I couldn't stop laughing in this video i am literally crying. I can see you put lots of effort into this video Bobby well done I loved the video!
The future archeologists are going have fun with this one
The frame is amazing 😳
Another fantastic video from Bobby 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻✌️
It's amazing Duke🤩😍❤✨
Wowowowow I cannot have imagined just how amazing this whole thing would be by the end. Bobby made the most fitting frame, it looks fantastic
YouTube needs to buy this and hang it in their front office!  👍🏻❤️
This is the most incredible collaboration I have ever seen. And the coolest frame ever.
You are remarkable.  I can only imagine the level of attention needed for you to focus on your art.  Your sacrifices create visionary and simply, genius work.  It’s a thrill to witness.
On top of the genius framework, your editing skills are beyond comprehensible. Wow. Just wow. Great job.
Jesus he used the personal collection audio from the pocket pussy guy
Amazing work Bobby! Literally made my day to see this posted and hoo boy did it deliver! I literally can't get over the finished piece with the photo and the frame, the colors are loud and proud like the rest of the art but not distractingly so.  The glow was an amazing touch, it really gave an otherworldly feel, plus with the whole piece the brain goes to the center and works around the piece before your eye follows the planet up to the crystals in a perfect harmony! (Sorry for the long comment but I had to art nerd out a bit xD)
Knocked it out the park Bobby. Amazing finish to an epic piece of art.
Excellent video! Question, are you a Zfrank1 fan? I get the same narration vibes sometimes.
bobby, i love you. don't forget that. i've been going through a rough time with depression, and watching your videos helps me so much. and hearing you say that "i'm disgusting" joke made me laugh so hard, bc i havent showered in like a week lmao. love u bobby, keep doin you. wewd4lyf.
Took him long enough
totally amazing
Wow, just wow. You've outdone yourself again man that's gorgeous
It’s probably the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen!! And honestly it looks like a movie poster…. I would see this movie!! Lol
I freaking love Bobby lmfao from the commentary to the art and just watching your channel grow over the years congratulations 🎉 Bobby on a job well done!!!
this is the coolest piece of art I've ever seen. incredible work guys!!!
Bobby needs a pressure pot for his resin pours!
amazing
I've watched from start to finish.  Wow. I tip my hat to all that have been involved in this. Wow. I'm happy to say that everyone that was involved in this I all ready had followed. How can I get a print?.
Dude, this is insane 😳 I just  have no words, no words🙀 You are not human!
His voice over voice 10/10 😂
You are freaking fantastico!!
13:21 Did u mean to put 2021
Bobby once again showing us that making incredible art can be accessible to anyone with a little ingenuity and a lot of incredibly tedious work
Wicked Apoxie beat bro!! I was tapping along wit ya.
Was the "Previously" part a "Hollywood High" reference?? I sure hope so. Hahaha!  Also, the finished product is absolutely stunning!
Most epic reveal!! It turned out amazing - all your time and attention to detailing certainly paid off!!!
You've outdone yourself this looks amazing the frame definitely brought the artwork to the next level
It must be hard trying to film him without cracking up. 🤣
Hell yeah
That is you best piece ever
Hahahahaha damn boy!!!! 🤍
I would of never of thought to make the crystals by sculpting them out of hardened clay,I would of 3d modeled them and printed it then molded them
Well Bobby. You’ve done it again!! It looks amazing!!! And i love watching you work on everything you make!!!! I swear your name will go down in history as one of the greatest artists to ever live !!! 😇😁😘
I forgot about this...it took you this long to make crystals...you had enough time to put a string in water and make actual crystals...
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
100% brings me so much joy the way you talk and mispronounce words on purpose! Gives me all the megamind vibes makes me stupid happy lmfao 🤣
I can honestly say it was worth the wait. Everyone did they thing!!
It is beautiful!
woah. awesome! great work! Bobby!
I was more impressed with the stop motion bit than with anything else, lol
Wait how u made the crystals is honestly similar as the ones when I made a geode pot in art class lol. Of course I used the scrap clay and a knife but it was close enough lol.
🗣Work of art mmm...ma😙🤌
Oh Bobby this is next level!! The patience and hardwork that went into this. 🙏 Plus the video production in this is also top notch. ❤️. This project turned out so wonderful.!
BEAUTIFUL frame, Bobby!  PS, I love your plate wall!
me: im a pro Someone: oh? what are u a professional in? me: what? no, im a procrastinator
@Bobby Duke Arts we don't deserve you. Your videos bring me so much joy.
praise that sun bobby!
Ship station? More like shit station. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Labor-intensive, to say the least.  Nonetheless, very cool.
that stop motion!
I thought I was the only one who said "crooks and nannies".
That turned out amazing!! I expected nothing less from each of you!  Super duper collab from some phenomenal artists!!!
Wow
Yay part 2
MAN, it turned out wayy better than I thought it would, I did NOT expect you to make the crystals the same way you drew them on paper, Well done!
I caught that Lateralus album at your desk! That's what's up!!!
Bobby's been getting crazy with the special effects lately and I appreciate that
Bobby you are a goof ball and some times a little bit cringe lol but you are a genius you most definitely did that art justice  and putting the lights on it  wow just wow amazing! thank you for being you!  i would like to thank your lady for being supportive of you!
O M G
Oh jesus the stop moton must have taken for ever...
This man is loosing his grasp on reality, wewd is his only consolation
Incredible Bobby, your work is always worth the wait.
Your wife's comment was comedy gold 😂
and the twerkin~! ^_^
wow i love this so much ... and all the ARTISTS on this too... and them transitions !~@@@@
Epically epic epicness.
Amazing work as always! You never disappoint 😁
3:37 i dont want to even think of how much time this took to make
I don't know where it comes from, or how you do it....but I love that it does and you can!!  HOLY DOOKIES!!
I love it
The stop motion at 3:45 is insane!! 😳
Whoever edits your videos needs a fucking raise!!! Very smooth and creative good job editing ghost!!!!
holy CRAP that looks amazing!
Literally breath taking. I wish I lived near you so could collaborate with you on art. I  love the design and I think you did a top notch job on it all. I'm always waiting with baited breath for your next creation. I hope you're feeling well and life is being good to you. You're looking good so whatever is working over there, keep at it. Mutch love from Canada.
YES! All Hail Bobby Duke! It's an epic frame for an epic painting!
Board imported from Sweden is called Björd. Good to know, Bobby, good to know!
absolutely insane! 🤩
Hell yes
I needed this video right now Bobby!  Thanks for being so awesomely open!
gordshus
Beyond Wewds.
13:36 song pls
Pure genius… just genius!  I could be having the worst day and watch one of your videos and it can make me laugh no matter what!!
well baked editing Ü
Im just blown away by all the work you put into this videos!
Wow! Perfect to a great painting wouldn't be the same without u bobby 💜
This guy is like most of us, but productive
LUV UR VIDS!!!
I think. All of as agree that the frame is much cooler than the drawing
13:29 was that an intended Dark Souls reference?
People without ADHD "Man that seems like a lot of work and could have been done so much easier"  People with ADHD "AHHH, A TRUE MASTER OF THE PROCESS!"
Cant wait for your next creation Bobby!! Love watching your videos!
13:36 song?
nothing starts my day off quite like watching Dukey while dropping a dookie...those molds really trigger my trypophobia...
It looks gerät! But i think there should be more Crystals on the site of the Frame
the frame really ties everything together. Awesome work sir Duke of Bobby!
bobby duke arts deserves ballon d'Or. 😂🔥
“When it comes to art, I am a hyper perfectionist.”  Me too, honestly. :)
Hii..enjoy watching. Nice to meet you
Beautifully done Bobby!!!
Im right there with ya on the cleansing part dawg.
Brilliant. So good.
Wow so much work went into that frame but it turned out absolutely beautiful!  The whole collaborative piece in general is amazing and this frame is totally the cherry on top that it deserves.  Well done to all involved, it's gorgeous.
Probably sulfur in the paint you used for the crystals which is why one of the silicones didn't cure.
I wish I was rich enough to buy this fucking masterpiece
That is truly amazing.
Bobby, you knocked it out of the park once again!!! I know the painting is going up for auction but what about some crystals on pedestal for sale/auction?
Ive loved this whole project! It really was amazing
Super awesome...way awesome than the awesome word itslef... The frame really enhances the awesomeness of the meticulously designed artwork...such a great piece of art...
The painting is cool and all, but that frame is amazing!
why is there a tape
It actually looks so much better than I thought it would
Imagine you make all of that and its the wrong size
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Bobby Duke Arts videos when youre watching them vs. when your parents walk in
You could hide a chocolate egg in there ya dungle
Wow!
I am in total awe of your skills, talent and sense of humor. Great work!!
Purely amazing work, Mr D.
This is so God Damm dope
What an insanely COOL project! 👏👏👏🤩😎
i fell in love with both the art and the frame.
I want to see the serious side of duke
I aspire to be this productively chaotic.
those crystal, oh my! love the new merch, I'm still hoping for a Wewd cap, especially a dad hat as my head is tiny
you should make nft’s
Truly an amazing collaboration. And what an epic finish.
"Into the cone that is silly."😂😂😂👌
You always say that anyone can do what you do but, no one can come up with designs that you do. Making them might not be hard but it  envisioning them is the thing that keeps you apart from the rest of us. Also, your videos are always fun to watch
Tengen Uzui: excellent 😏
I absolutely love love love the artistry and skill you've poured into this, but the look really isn't for me.  But who am I kidding I wouldn't be able to afford this in a 100 years, so...
Bobby you are so talented that sometimes I really think you should be father of my children for your hyperperfectionist genes.   I'm a male btw.
Masterpiece! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Mona Lisa who?...
Bobby, the amount of work and effort you put into this is just UNREAL! 🤯There is absolutely nothing lazy or disgusting about you. You are a hero Bobby...a bona-fide DukerHero. Bravo!!!!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Aaaaaammmmmmaaaazzzzing!!!  You did an awesome job!  Every artist involved  made this extra special 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✨✨✨✨✨✨✨💫💫💫💫💫💫
Это шедевр! А ты - прекрасен! Помню тебя еще маленьким младенцем, гуляющим до мастерской то так, то сяк. Растёшь, зараза! Так держать!
" ehahah Ryannnn" 🤣
God Bobby, what has the world done to deserve you. You're a fricken national treasure.
Who else feared for the safety of those plates during the twerking ? 😅
It's beautiful, Bobby!
This was a masterclass of how to make creation entertaining! Will have to pick up a print 🥰
Great work everyone, you made the community proud ❤️
That looks incredible.
Loved every minute of this whole project. 💯
History making
Incredible work!
That looks SICK!
MADNESS!!
The frame definitely finished off the art piece! You really did a fantastic job!
My only regret is that I can't like the video more than once
4 minutes in and convinced you are an artsy fartsy mad genius!!!……I like it!
That mold triggerd my tryhpophobia ngl
been waiting for part two! I am truly speechless 😶 art is made out of anything & beautiful!
bobby how are you so funny and how can you make that epic arts
@BobbyDukesArt needs to do a cross over video with @Evan&Kaytlin.
Amazing...
11:22 replay button 😂
The perfect ending for the perfect art 🖼🤤😍😍😍
YOU PROMISED US YOU WOULDNT TAKE LONG!
@Bobby Duke Arts  dude u need a vac chamber . and if u plaster cast the the outside on the molds they will be sturdy and less susceptible to distortion (applies to bigger molds
It's so cool!!! Those moves are- I mean, the frame, yes, the frame is so awesome!
Please throw more mugs at the wall.
Not most valuable, but damn cool!
So the pedestal crystals _were_ better.
I hope this get bought by a museum so the public/fans can see it. It would be such a shame for it to disappear into a private collection...
Mmhhhmmm
Stop motion, nice touch <3 love to see it
Checkmate ZHC,,,, 🤗🤗🤗✨✨❤️💕
Insane!!! 😍😍😍 By far the coolest piece of art I've ever seen! Everyone did amazing and this frame takes it to a whole other level! 🔥🔥
Would someone please send Bobby a 2x72 grinder?  You know he would use the heck out of it!
I feel like The White eyed Duke should be the new villain of the show. That was genuinely creepy! Haha
That's a million dollar art piece i swear, forget about stupid Crypto punks
”Link to Part 2 in description”? Isn’t THIS part 2?! 😅
I guess one could say, you fingered it out! 😎
That whole shebang looks amazing on my crappy screen. I can't even encapsulate in my minds eye what it would look like in person.
Friggin absoulty gobsmack drop dead amazing!!!!!!!!  this is so flipping cool and im so happy that i got to watch such incredible artists make something truly wonderful together!
Even the stop motion took waaaaaay more time than I can imagine
beautiful
Everytime i watch your videos i completely crack up and have the best laugh of my life, it can't be topped
My dude!! Your work is amazing 🙀
masterpiece
Amazing!! Some point I would have been questioning my very existence.
👍
Wow....just wow !!! This is amazing !!!!
Can we just appreciate that not only did Bobby work his butt off but also: THE EDITING! There‘s stop motion and it’s all so smooooooof. 😍 Love you Bobby! Edit: eff, that artwork is sick too,, 😍 Edit 2: Do you and the duchess ship together?! I want it all! 🤣 Edit 3: That’s just a beautiful project, y‘all really did some magic here.
Duuuudeeeee what!!!!!!???? INSANE!!!! you must be god
The editing is better than ever and the stare while gluing the crystals was badass
To be honest, the frame gave the art life.
wtf is this clickbait? You can't just claim that you have made the most valuable frame. I thought that you were better than that, Bobby.
Now do another one.
Why are you an awesome YouTuber/actor/artist  It's really inspiring
that is a truly beautiful piece of art
The amount of effort he puts in is commendable
totally framed it
It’s so cool!
7:12, lateralus vinyl.. nice.
Beautiful job man.
Turned out absolutely sick! It is so incredibly cool! Absolutely great, I love it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow! This was a cool finish to this amazing challlange. Now how to send this without completely destroying it...? 🤔
Me: " Oh shit !! The frame looks damn good.... How more awesome would it be with LEDS lights?" Bobbyduke installing LED lights. !! YYAAASSSSSSS
Epicly epic epiclepsy !!!!!!
It turned out better than expected and I had high expectations...Great job!!!
Why do you think the silicone dunk method didn’t set ? Do you think more time would resolve this or ....redo ?
He is the living embodiment of dad jokes
I LOVE YOUR WORK AND YOUR CHANNEL ❤️♥️💜
Spectacular job as always Bobby. 🖤
13:29 that was unironically insane
It was worth the wait! So majestic!
Thats fucking awsome
I was waiting for it omggg it's a masterpiece!!♥
Bobby's videos are so infrequent now that when I get a notification I literally squeal, clap my hands and yell YEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!! Oh, and surprised to no one, it's PERFECTION!
Not only is the frame amazing, but your videos are legitimately funny. Multiple times I laugh out loud at some of your bits. Inspiring work and great content as always!
At first I didn't know what was this video about. But when I saw the painting I remembered the collab. It turned out amazing. Didn't even thought that you were making a frame for it
You and your fellow artistes are the awesomest dudes EVER!! Bobby that frame is beyond cool!
Bobby never fails to impress me more and more each time. the amount of work, patience and dedication is incredible and the result is absolutely breathtaking. i'm a huge fan
Damn! oO  Now I wish I were rich for a whole new reason! <3
God so much of hard work, but possible to Bobby.🤝🤝
I have waited so long for this?  I am not disapointed 😍
Oh my god, this a hella lit project I have ever seen! A perfect end to a great art collab!
🐐
MASSIVE SPOILER:                      This is the last part of him making the frame :)
Awesome process
Looks amazing! You could have done some asmr popping those crystals out of the modules 😅😜
👏
I can't every time I see that vine that he did at the beginning, I literally die of laughter because my name is Ryan
👍👏👍👏
Amazing work Bobby! 👍🏻 You really are an amazing artist! It was definitely worth the wait!
Honestly, if Bobby and his wife aren't relationship goals I don't know what is. And of course, the frame is absolutely insane (in the best way possible). It complements the collaboration piece so well while still being unique in its style. I am in awe of your creativity and tenacity to see it through exactly the way you envision it.  Also: That sequence at 3:37 must have taken forever to film and I would like to point at that it is very much appreciated.
this is going to be the mona lisa after 400 years in the future.
YESSSSSS!!!!!
Holy buttcheeks, this turned out amazing :O
I cried when he did the reveal x'D <3 It's absolutley awesome!!!
you are awesome!
Dude, this auction will easily go over 100k. This is such an amazing art work
Imagine him while editing his videos..pretty sure he questions his sanity
Finally, after a month
FINALLY ITS HERE
Congratulations BD... Hey, can you design me a tattoo :) Something theatrical :)
👏 🙀 😯 😮 😲 Amazing
good job, it looks great!
Absolutely incredible! 👍
Thats a solid peice of epoxy
OMG!! This is the frame of all of my magical dreams come together!!! Glorious and gorgeous... stunning and fit for that epic piece of art!!
I followed the entire journey from start to finish and.. Bobby Duke made it from 2D art into 3D art! It already was special when the painting came to Bobby but he is just...... an Artist from another Planet!  WOW! 😲👌😎
Ur dogs are cute. And that unexpected kiss from one was funny
Epic!
My favorite thing is Bobby asking (in a serious tone) "is that stupid?"
What a THICC video!
Nice seeing Lateralus @7:17
00:27 shout out to people who feels that all the time 😬
Sooo good!
Top das galáxias 💚
What a great video!!!!
Wow, that is so perfect 🤩
This is just epic!!
absolutely crazy, great work!
wah this is so cool!!
One of these days you need to do something using the shards from the dussin of thing you have broken in your shop.
Ooo uii woa 🤯
I need an epic frame like that for the big diamond painting I just finished . But that's a job I'll start working on tomorrow.
Should have titled it "I make a $1m frame and gave $100k to the best comment" meanwhile giving absolutely zero credit to the amazing contributing artists... ZHC style lol
AWESOME VIDEO !!!!!!!!!!!
I love your energy. I love your art. Please, for the love of the art, buy an actual belt sander. Before you lose  finger or toe.
A perfectionist? PFFT, I would have carved solid stone and waited thousands of years to grow real quartz crystals.
I am proud of you and all of the collaborating artists for how amazing the finished piece turned out! But also, holy **** that was a lot of work! From evey single contributor! I could never! I've done a lot to contribute to my friends art pieces and they've similarly done a lot for mine, but no where near this level and I am amazed! Great job!
Beautiful
At last !!!!!!!!!! Love it
AMAZING
Mate, your hilarious! And so talented I love your videos
Dope
So dang much fun.
Wow this art makes me feel
Its just beautiful
Awesome. Lots of love from Iran. U pro 💎
This is mind-blowing amazing!!! 😱🤯❤
The effort you put into your work is incredible, and it's always a pleasure to see your progress and the humour that tags along with it.  Keep up the amazing work Bobby, and I look forward to your next video
This is incredible 🥰 the amount of work you put in is amazing and the results are stunning!
Holy shit this is AMAZING
Not the personal collection noooooo 😂
That wipe was amazing! I’m sure the frame comes out great too. That wipe tho!
The music, editing, idea, comedy, and the art everything on this video is perfect!
im so glad i came back to this channel
"Twerking hard or hardly twerking? Am I right?" lmao
Well worth the wait for part 2. This has been the most entertaining/interesting collab ive followed on YT
give me it to my , thank you.
I got goosebump looking at that, I think your final touches brought the piece all together, absolutely beautiful work.
😍😍
Unlike some NFT art, this one deserves to be auctioned for a BIG sum of money,  because it came out AMAZING and is being sold for a good cause! Great job everyone!
Does the artwork have to please? Of course it doesn't have to. It doesn't have to at all. It is simply a matter of personal taste. And if we all had the same one, the world would be a very boring place. But: you simply have to admire the craftsmanship and skill that is necessary to create such a masterpiece. And yes, I very much admire the craftsmanship I see here. 👌👍
Bobby, I love watching your creative process as much as the final product. You are a super cool human being and your creations are unique and beautiful!
Wow that turned out amazing!!
13:37 Ouh.... yeah...  *________* Every time I watch one of your videos, I am blown away a little more. :D
Beautiful!
Hey Bobby I love watching your YouTube videos because one you're funny and too I'm a bit of a perfectionist myself and I'm way too harsh on myself so yeah it's okay plus I love all the amazing things that you do really nice 👌anyhoo🦉 hoot y'all have a very blessed day🙏❣.
🙇‍♀️ 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️ 🙇‍♀️wow thank the heavens for an artist like you amazing 🤩
i love watching you, funny cool artist master
It’s giving hella production value. I love it, Picasso *chefs kiss*
dMe what a hell of a collaboration
pls u don't hav to be too weird
Is it just me or is this man a freaking art genius, look at that frame it's Soo beautiful
this is truly a piece of art, and the person that gets to put it in a wall, will be the luckiest person in the world. Hope one day it goes to a museum and people get to enjoy it as a piece of history
What a brilliant creative mind!!!
How talented can one man be. Incredible dukster.
I think it may be time to upgrade ye belt sander, my lord. Hehe, just me recalling that collab u did with Alec Steele and his reaction to ur janky belt sander setup🤣🤣🤣
Despite the amazing crystal frame part, 13:30 is the best thing I’ve ever seen
Love so much WELL DONE TO ALL THE ARTISTS 🎨 👏 🙌 ❤
Absolutely amazing bobby!!
When frame is better art than actual art hahahah No, all works are amazing, painting is great...and frame is fantastic...good job guys
While some in the realm behave like an overdose of cotton candy. The Crystal farts inspired air drums. That's how I know I'm in the right saloon.
...and I love you Bobby! Keep up the great and inspirational work, at any pace you feel good doing so! :) <3
Hi from Kamchatka🙂🤝
love you man
I wow! 😂 I want that
The amount of work you put into this is just crazy. And the result is even crazier. I am so proud to be a part of this GREAT Project!
That art piece and frame are absolutely gorgeous!  I mean, wow!  You guys are very talented. Thank you for sharing with us.  🥰🥰
So did you finish this in 2021??
That's freaking Amazing!
The clear silicone didn’t cure because it’s platinum cure, which is inhibited by epoxy. I had this happen to me once & just gave up on the project for a whole year haha 🤦‍♀️ such a nightmare.
WOW!!! Bobby first off , the amount of effort you put into your videos is simply amazing , and secondly that frame you created is beyond amazing , really awesome and very inspirational , keep up the amazing work ... you creative genius!!!!! :)
Finalllllyyyyyy,,,,!!!!!
Are you kidding me? Holy crap, you're a master at this.
Alec Steele really needs to hook you up with a new belt sander :D
This madman not only devoted all of his creative force into the frame but still finds the time to skit and make a picture animation. Big energy
BRAVO!!! You all did amazing work! It’s been so fun watching this whole process. It’s beautiful!
Can we appreciate how much time that stop motion part must have taken 3:40
I liked it when he said "butt load"
You make my day
Should’ve wore the same shirt for a third day to exact dominance ;)
Has Alec still not delivered on that grinder?
5:35 It would be so funny if in the end he ate real food of the same appearance.
Woooooooow! 😲 I wonder what's gonna happen to it now. I think it should go into an art museum! Like this is 100% a masterpiece and should be out there for the world to see! 😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It turned out amazing!!
I literally looked on your channel yesterday to check if part 2 is up. Thank you Bobby! <3
I'm just here for the random stuff being smashed
You can never go wrong with some crystals! 🌴🎭
wow this is truly an amazing piece, watched all the process but still got impressed by the final result, great job!!
The best collaboration i have ever watched!
Not gonna lie, I mostly dislike the resign designs and artwork but this is dope as heck, god dayum!
Yeee
Totes amazeballs
Thank you bobby for your all videos we get a lots of pleasure watching you❤️
This looks extremely amazing! What a finish!!!
Sir Bobby The Duke!!! yours are the only videos i still get excited about, thank you for being you
You’re the jack sparrow of artists… I love jack sparrow :D
The artwork is great and but holy shit that frame..... that has to be my favorite thing you've have made. I would just hang the frame, it's that good.
the silicone didnt cure because it didn't get enough oxygen for the reaction
Dope
Brilliant!
how can he do that infront of his wife XD i feel embarrassed for him lmao
Mr Duke you are freaking jean-i-us. So funny and so clever.  This collaboration has been the best thing in YouTube ever.  So good
Wow this turned out bootyfull!!! 💕
Man you outdone yourself… never let down that’s for sure!! Can’t wait to keep seeing the content you got in store for us!!!!
Thanks fucking epic!!
Been waiting for part2 cause the frame itself is apart of the artwork!
Bobby, you have an enormous amount of skill and patience to make art like this. I have no idea how you keep your sanity. . . Oh. . . Sorry. . .
Amazing
Woow 😮🤩
What a epic finish for a epic piece of art. I have been waiting so long for this video and was not disappointed with the end result 🤙🏽👍🏽🤙🏽👍🏽
bobby duke gives off such dad energy
Bravo! Bravo!))
bobby duke's editing is superior
Absolutely amazing!!
Bobby’s expression when he realised the camera can talk
4:48 these were THE funniest cuts 😂🤣
Duke you don't know what did you done with that ending sound🤦‍♀️😭 I was in teacher room during the break watching the video and their was a student talking with other teacher when she heard that sound she turned at my direction her face turned to red and she was trying to hold her laughter she thought I farted😔😭😭
That is the most bicthin frame I've ever seen. Holy crap that is awsome.
AMAZING 🤩 Absolutely love it!! And as always sooooo entertaining.  Just makes you want more…. Pleeeeeeeeeease 🙏🥰🙏
Love you too, Bobby Duke Arts.
“Also I promise you won’t have to wait too long for part 2” Part 1: 1 month ago 😂  Twas SO worth the wait 😍
Epic 🔥😭👏🏾🤯🤣😵‍💫😱🥳
The big reveal was funny and  incredible
Inigo Montoya made my day ;)
Let´s take a moment to appreciate all the video editing here. Fascinating. What is the music on 02:40 ?
One word: DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!! Love it!
you are absolutely amazing
The cleansing/charging of the crystals was immaculate 🤣🤣
I wyant some of those crystals!!!
You bloody NAILED IT! The frame really suits the art works. Just like the painters working together to make a cohesive whole, you've wrapped it all up in a labour intensive gorgeous frame. Awesome work I love it!
Before I thought picture frames... boring. Now I'm reevaluating my life. Thanks Bobby
You're amazing, Duke!
Amazing ending to an awesome project!!!
Your video is so beautiful, you're making me cry :')
Amazing. .. and hilarious
That frame looks amazing ! The whole project was such a great idea and fun to watch. Thank you to all of the artists ❤️
That is so frickin cool!
This guy is beyond impressive. The art is one thing, but to be such a character and also have the chops to edit together an extremely entertaining video showcasing himself and his art...well done Bobby Duke...
The attention to detail on getting the crystals to match the sketch... DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE
What an epic collaboration.. every addition is a masterpiece. The most epic collaboration I've ever seen. I wonder how much it's gonna go for ..$$
Bobby made a frame that just stole the show. Probably put the most heart and soul into it. Incredible…
Such a crackhead I LOVE IT!!!!!
Bobby can u make me a hatsune miku figure please i really like figure
I was here !
EPIC!!!
You are great, man, go on 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🙏🏻🌹🎊🎉
The stop motion... insane effort for a gag
Bobby once said.... "NOBODY LIKES THE PART NUMBER TWO"......  Well, here we are, smashing the like button in a rage....😂😂  Luv u bobby ❤❤♥
wow that end result is just stunning bobby always good entertainment watching this channel. "parp"
epic
Absolutely amazing! Beautiful. The amount of work. Wow. Brings the whole collab to an epic and masterful conclusion.  Your acting, directing, producing and editing skills are superentertaining. Thank you for sharing your talents. They brighten up my day.
Boboi Dooook , nice work 😎
Ohhhhh my .... Speachless.....
Just freaking WOW.
That intro felt like an acid trip lol
Wooooow!!! 😱😱🤩
a very amazing work, I always wait for you to upload even though it takes a long time but with amazing results like this I think it's worth it, and include a little humor it's an amazing thing that makes us watch will not get bored, greetings from Indonesia👍
Pro tip:don't watch Bobby after a sesh🍃
0:05 I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣
No disrespect, but it's annoying the hell out of me to watch this video despite the fact that I've been waiting so long to see what happens to the collaboration Ten Hundred started.
جميل جدا حبيبي.
YES, WE LIVED TO SEE THIS DAY! That's some savage work of art! I was happy to follow it from video to video, excited to see another and another great artist get their hands on it! I hope I could participate in a similar project somewhere in the future, this sure must feel soo satisfying for an artist! 🌴🎭
Glad you didn't go to too much trouble 🤣🤣🤣
A w e s o m e !!! Leaves me speechless... 😍👍
the patience that woman has :D
Finally!!!!
Bobby, I love you, but wouldn't it have been easier to just carve out resin crystals instead of clay from the beginning?
My God that's amazing!
Amazing dude, I wewdent and cewdent have done better if I had had twice the time and resources. You da man.
Bobby dukes is what Jimmy from Ed, Edd and Eddy became after they grew up change my mind
Smashed it
Love ❤️  ya Bobby!
Reveal song: AGST - Flaw
Omg that frame is  absolutely astounding
Does anyone know what the final music/song for the reveal is? I'm pretty sure it starts 12:54 and the slow build up is awesome
The amount of effort put into is insane ❤
I always have to watch your videos twice. Not because I'm slow, but because the first time I just watch your shenanigans and realize I have no idea what you just made, so I watch it again to see what cool and magical item you have come up with. Thank you for the laughs and the beautiful art you put out.
Awesome work, I love what you do keep up the amazing work.
Wtf... Wow... I'm having a brainfart from watching that... This is absolutly beautiful😳
Your vids make me smile. Thank you. ♥️
What is the music played at the reveal?
The frame turned out to be sooooo good and it is so much cohesive with the painting. It is like Jazza's Saturn ring was blasting out of the frame and forming crystals.
When I saw the final result only one thing came from deep heart "Satisfaction". It is soooooo perfect. I can't hold myself watching the result several times.
Flippin amazing! It’s perfect!!!!
😻 oh my... I was shivering twords the end this is BEAUTIFUL!!! I can't wait to see the video of the original who started this 🤩
I really like this guy he reminds me of me when I was a kid and I still feel like that sadly I can’t act like that in public lol even if his videos take forever to upload and everything I still wait and hoping he’ll make some thing new and very cool I like him a lot he’s cool and funny just like I used to be I hope he is doing good
This is my comment
we love you too ❤❤
WOW!!! 💜 :D you did such an amazing job!!! love how it turned out 💜💜💜
3:37 I don’t know how much time that took moving every freaking piece and making a stop motion of it,    but it’s an awesome scene! Thanks for making me laugh too, I needed it!
Dookie you are amazing and amazingly talented... i wish you wouldn't overwork yourself but i also need more of your insane stupidity and endless creativity... love your stuff 💞🤩
Loved it 😍
God's almighty that is absolutely stunning
this is sooooo cool! hahaha, this is by far the craziest artwork I have seen so far, every single artist put so much energy and effort in it. Damn, you nailed it with the crystals at the end! Really dope! It was a little bit painful to see you sawing the artwork and drilling a hole in it, but the light is like the cherry on the cake! So dope!
Can't get enough of your videos, love all the work you do and love your humor....thanks for another amazing video.❤🤟
this was STUNNING. the piece is indescribable- my jaw is permanently fused to the floor after this one. send help. you're a josh dang genius, king dukey!!
As someone who grew up in their family‘s art gallery and frame shop, that is the most amazing frame I have ever witnessed. Utterly amazing!
Nice Lateralus record you got there Bobby :)
9:03 he does the ocho ocho
Amazing work! And great video.
9:48 "Was it as Thick as that Twerk was" lol. almost spit out my water. stop it you two are too cute!
My goodness bobert you’ve completely outdone yourself bravo good sir🎩❤️
That is amazing! You did a great job!
4:26 Blues Clues
Stunning
Completely AMAZING
is that a tape 😂
the amount of hardwork you guys do in your videos and the level of creativity is extraordinary and freakin amazing and much funny too literally got goosebumps when the completed frame got revealed  hats off to you guys  definitely i could say that you guys are the best artist in the world thank you for making such a piece of art and showing us on YouTube🙏🔥🔥
Yooo, thats SO sick dude!! I especially love how the crystal portion came out!!
I really want to know if your family is glad you found an outlet for your creativity OR if we feed your insanity and it drives them crazy. Either way, keep it up!!
12:35 THAT was SUCH a drummer move. I haven’t played in 20 years and I felt that.
You know Bob's on God mode when his eye starts to show the divine glow.. Bless me Bobby, bless us all......
This is epic! 👏🏻
Amazing.  Entertaining.  Great collab.  What a way to finish this journey .... I can rest now.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 soooooo amazing
Damn the Duke does it again! I'm super impressed by everyone's great work and collaboration. You all killed this project! Duke im gonna be needed some custom framing from you sir!
You've Outdone yourself man, Hands down the Greatest Craftsman of all of the YouTube. Phenomenal Work.
Amazing work!!🤙
So amazing!
Respect the process
When you come up w some wild concept but then no more delaying can be done and it's time to realize it... Past me, why
I've watched you create many things brotha but (excuse please but) Damn!!! That frame with that art is truly amazing. I watched each artist as they added their own and can say I'm speechless. Well done one and all. Really there are no words adequate enough to express the respect I have for the time and effort that went into this.
😮❤
Dude! That is AMAZING! I love the whole thing, but that frame!
Man you absolutely nailed it. That frame is perfect. So unique and holds its own against such an awesome painting but doesn't distract from it at all.
The fact he did that many measurements for the crystals is crazy impressive. I totally would have just guessed like the dangerous edge living person I am😂😂 also the stop motion was mesmerizing
PROPS to the MEGA COLLAB, yall are awesome for doing this so well!!!!
I don’t think I’ve ever cried tears of joy whilst holding my mouth slightly agape in awe of such a more gorgeous piece of artwork made by all my fav artist🥺😭❤️
I’ve been following this collaboration from the beginning. You did everyone proud, the frame frickin took the painting to another dimension. I almost cried at the reveal, holy crap lol WOW!!!!!
is it just me or is anyone else IN LOVE with Bobby's new merch design💘💝🤎🤎💜💙💞💗💟💛
This looks so damn amazing. The frame really does it justice and blows the uniqueness of this piece out of proportions. Not only is the entire art piece a really cool global collaboration of talented artists, but the frame being a PART of the art piece is just phenomenal. Well done, Bobby. That frame is a master piece.
Song at 12:11 and 13:59???
I love Bobby duke art
Bobby, your art always amazes me. You are so creative and you have very smart ways of making the project turn out exactly how you imagined it. This is one of my favorite projects you’ve done so far. It looks stunning. The fact your art is so amazing, combined with how funny and entertaining your videos are, makes you such an amazing YouTuber. I’ve literally watched all of your videos, some multiple times even. I love your content so much <3
Absolutely incredible Bobby! And the camera woman is brilliant too 😀
This is the best thing I have ever watched
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Sorry Bobby, but your Frame is better then this ugly drawing, without it, the Picture would be even more useles.
That stop motion reel is what he was really doing while he procrastinated for 3 days
This is absolutely amazing. The frame is gorgeous 😍
Killer frame!  You knocked it out of the park.  It’s perfect for the painting and it has the Bobby Duke pizzazz.  Which means it’s freaking Awsome the whole thing.
looks amazing!!!
When it comes to making art there can be a split between pure design and pure spontaneity. We can see that in this video at the climax when he is struggling to make it unified. The final product is pure balance. Well done sir. Executed like a true master. Bobby, this project made you a better artist and a better person. The Duke has Risen!!!!!!!
loved every step of the process. also bobby your editing game is tight lately! everything you present is just so FUN!!
Someone who is just learning English must be very confused watching this
That is the perfect finishing touch to an amazing collaboration! Well done!
wow
It sounds and looks like plaster 2:20
2:21 - I just had to rebuild my overclock profile and just solidified it after some system issues and this made my heart sink for a sec.
Thank you!
Drinking iced cold chocolate milk while watching a video that I’ve waited for patiently is a good feeling. Thank you, it’s beautiful 🥲🦢
That frame looks legendary 😃😃😃🤩
So todays lesson is  how to twerk 👍😂
I do not like this guy, so obnoxious. So glad he finally finished this, now I can never consume his content again.
That is absolutely gorgeous!
Been waiting for this masterpiece after part one
I would like to enter my critique. You see every critique I had you addressed and made better, so I had no critique to use. This upset me since I am a shallow angry person. I need to judge others and make them feel less, but you have taken away my ability, This makes me angry and I blame you for taking away my joy. I hope you're satisfied.
Thick frame, thick resin pour, and thick twerk!!! Chef's Kiss **  This channel deserves all the subs!!
I like how the entire art collab ended on a fart joke
This thing turned out amazing. The crystals really brought it together.
One of your best video/projects ever! Great job all the way around. Thanks for sharing!
God damnnnnnnn !!!!!!!!!!!!
Some things should just be hung in a museum tbh
The most beautiful piece of art..!
Finally
🙂👍
Not gonna lie, i almost started clapping when i saw the frame and picture mounted. And the level of this video editing is just too much for my soul.🔥🔥🔥
Am I gjr only one who sees orange molds not pink?
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏👏Wow!!!!
Holy heck that frame is amazing.
Bobby with that bundle of Sage looking like a true Cheech and Chong moment. Man I love this channel.
Bobby, you are SO fun to watch! I am amazed by the talent you have, not only in crafting, but also in your editing and camera work. 😄❤️
You sir are truly a Master of your craft!
I love that the frame isn’t overpowering the artwork but adding to it, amazing work Bobby!
Oh wow, that just looks amazing and is the perfect frame for this piece of art. What a journey it's been on!
8:18 - Sh*@ more in less time...  sounds dangerous... let's try it.
That is ASTOUNDING!  Love your work so much!  Wow!
wewd 👍
My favorite Youtuber. Stunning artwork, creative solutions, relatable hiccups, transparent problems, comedic editing, intriguing personality, and overall superb product cannot be beat. Thanks for another video as priceless as this artwork.
"encased in the cone that is silly"  Haha
The crystals came out great Bobby. Cheers from India.
Well done, awesomely well done ✨
Hi
really awesome work as always Bobby... Had wondered a bit when I saw you mixing the resin but didn't add any dye....but then you stuffed in the dichroic film and I knew where you were going ...It really turned out nicely!
Stunning, and beautiful 😍🥰🥰🥰well done Bobby😃👍👏👏👏👏greetings from the Netherlands 🙋🏽‍♀️🇳🇱
i love you 2
lot of work went into it
Spectacular  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am gonna right click and copy :)
Very nice
One of the bestest art pieces I have seen so far . . . When this piece shows up in the Louvre's Museum for auction, I m definitely taking it home!!!   Also i am broke AF rn😂
Your videos make me so happy! i broke my foot today and im so happy i saw this today!
I can't escape shipstation today 😂 I love it, we use it at my job but holy shit we had so many orders and I was the only one on shift who knows how to process them
"Also I promise you won't have to wait too long for part 2".......well did I forget about it after a month? Yes. But was it worth the wait? Absolutely
Wow it’s glorious.
Fantastic! Such a fun collab and loved watching this!
mayhaps the reason your silicon molds did not cure well was because of getting the ratios wrong, also it could just take longer to harden, or the temperature can affect it as well. IDK, it could have just been the silicon mold gods deciding to mess with you for all I know.
Amazing 🙌💯
This Videos are the lidel bit of normal in my I need
This guy never gets old 😂 love his sense of humor!
9:03 dumpster be THICC
i wasnt able to find this channel cuz i forgot the name (sorry)  i used my brain and just typed in 'wewd' and the entire channel popped open!!!
is that a butterfly rc plane in your work shop?
I want this piece of art so bad, but I know it will never be in my price range. What an incredible masterpiece, by some incredible artists. Bobby you took it to a whole another level.
Hi
That is sooooo sick!
This is honestly one of the most beautiful pieces of art I've ever seen! The colors are so vibrant and make me happy, and the sheer amount of work and effort that went into this is astounding. You have my undying respect and admiration~
Once again, AMAZING!  Mind blown!
As usual, you've gone so extra no one will ever top it. Great work!!
you are one of the reasons I got into resin I hope to one day get on your level. DUDE THAT FRAM MAN DUDE!!!!! SOO GOOD !!!!
LOL… you’re SO ridiculous, it’s HILARIOUS!!  I love your humor!!! 🤣🤣🤣  By the way… you could ABSOLUTELY sell those raisin crystals! I’d buy some! And, you already have the mewlds made! Easy $$!
I cant wait for Ten Hundred's review. The frame came out awesome, my favorite part of the entire piece is the hyper realistic piece of tape I had to just look up who did it haha.
I absolutely love every video this man makes. He’s a literal pro at humor, and being an awesome content creator. Thank you man for making my day, and for adding a little more happiness into this world. 👏👏👏👏👍🥳👍
I always love your creativity and excitement in your videos but the fleshlight dude audio took me tf out
I always love your creativity and excitement in your videos but the fleshlight dude auto took me tf out
WE LOVE YOU BOBBY 😁😁😁
It was worth the wait! This is super awesome, you truly create masterpieces!!!
Youtube cant get any better
Wow, that turned out way more beautiful than I originally thought when looking at the drawing. Amazing job, Bobby - Just enough glamour to be eye catching and beautiful, but not so much to be distracting.
Christ it's like a real life Steam frame.
Damn that's a Hot frame ...
How have you not made a sick-cured joke yet for resin?
Was there just a teeny tiny escapage of gas upon drilling into that frame??? or was it just me 😮
This is insane! You always somehow top your last video. It just blows my mind!
That's a painting I want to bid on! Or in other words...  _I wawnt thayt._
Bra!!!! That stopmotion bit was insane. So much time !!!
I hate that I knew where the “light up the runway with something from my personal collection” voiceover is from 😂😂😂
That is absolutely amazing!! It completes the artwork perfectly! I am speechless with its beauty 🤩🤯🤯
6:46 if you can use that there are pills you can buy 👍
Absolutely fantastic Bobby!
Wow, just wow!!!!!!! It is beautiful
My man maxed out the artistic tree on his skyrim run
coolest frame ever
The mold... Hear me out...
That is so cool oh my god and your frickin hilarious 😂
🙌🙌🙌
I see you. I am also lazy and disgusting. Its good to be in this space. We save water
For me, if I could pick any painting in the world to own... That would be it.
I actually gasped out of fear when you talked like a FNAF character lmao  Its looks amazing Bobby, breath taking, the effort you guys put into this is what makes it so special
@6:46 I know what you did there
Just nailed it Bobby it's wow
Absolutely frickin amazing! So so so clever. X
LIGHT UP THE RUNWAY WITH SOMETHING FROM MY PERSONAL COLLECTION HAD ME CRYING
Every piece of work bobby does amazes me every time. He always has an outstanding idea for every project he does. Keep up the fantastic work bobby
A short time... seriously? It was a MONTH to wait.... UGH.... Need the video.... Love the work. Great idea.... wonder when it will go up for sale.... Hugs from Esquimalt. Now ssssshhhhhhhhh
All the stop motion scenes are beautiful
It would be so cool to see more projects like this. All the artist that were involved did amazing job.   I love the frame mainly because I'm a crazy crystal lover.
This turned out so amazing.. I cant even imagine how much this would go for at auction. Im guessing A LOT.
Maaannn this is beautifullllll
That was mind blowing!
Wow you didn't even have to make a full stop motion crystal mini parade but ya did anyways, love it
where can i find that shirt you were wearing at 4:48?
Did no one see that bobby got epoxy on his tongue.
Hoooooooooooooooooooyeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,
7:15 I see that lateralus album
How hard was the epoxy to get out of your beard? I know tasted it!
FINALLYpart two is here,i was waiting for a long time!!!!!!!!!
wow this is just breath taking.
Unreal
OMFG bobby so thicccccc
Quality content absolutely need time..
Love Your Videos Bro ❤❤❤
yes! im not the only one who's seen princes bride!
I made some resin crystals a while back for a Sea of Thieves skull, and I used this EXACT process. ApoxieSculpt, sanding to shape, dunk method, the whole nine yards.
Just wow
Very simply put, that is "FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!"  Looks like all those craft classes at the institution paid off, glad they let you out, most crazies never get released. LOL
Gaaaahhhhhh this is INCREDIBLE. I've been watching this art saga unfold for a while and this is such a glorious finale
Every buttby Duke appearance (for those who need idk why I did this it's 3am-) 2:50 8:55 9:02 10:45
The Sage ends, on a HIGH note.
I literally can't get over the DEDICATION, I mean not only did he make this absolutely gorgeous frame but the video as well?? STOP MOTION??? All the editing??? I'm convinced he is simply not human
Crystal ***** XD
That’s insane! I didn’t think you could pull something off so amazing- but I did.
Great job man 😍😍
You are a fucking beast mate !! 👍👍👍
Fuking amazing
Best art collab ever! It's amazing how well all the styles fix together in this beautiful work 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
your editing has gotten so good, dude. And the actual ways you transition from frame to frame is as creative as the rest of your art!
Fantastic art piece!  You are so talented!
Awesome sauce!!!!!!
owo
That frame is amazing...You are amazing!!
Wow, that's beautiful! Also, Bobby always has the best music in his videos ❤️
6:47 😭😭😂
Unbelievable job from everyone involved. To have Bobby finish it all up was the best.
Duuuude!! That's an epic project and it looks amazing!!!
A-ma-zing! I have followed the project all the way. It has been a true joy to see it grow.
Finally!!!! It’s better than I think anyone expected!! Great work to all of you! 🔥🔥🔥
While Bobby was making the crystals. I can only think of Crash bandicoot out in the world, trying to find them
this guy makes adhd look like a horse sedative
"Wets take a dip in the stwawbewwy wiver" -Sasquatch
The real question is what is it that he keeps smashing against the wall🤔🤔
Wowsers the amount of work that has gone into this piece is astounding. Bobby  love seeing you back on YouTube
Your videos are an absolute joy to watch. Thank you for good content. 👍
Anybody know what music he used in the video?
How to make things a hundred times more difficult than you need to:
The moment I’ve been waiting for 😍 soooo cool that is a million dollar project 🙏❤️
You totally killed it! Amazing! Watching your process for this is so cool.
wheres part 3??
fabulous
whos the girl with sunglasses and orange hoodie on bobby's shirt?
You really are amazing.  Just…. amazing. Incredible. Awesome. Fantastic. Funny. Talented.  There just aren’t enough superlatives.  My most favouritest person what creates stuff ever.   Seriously, you are so damn talented and fun to watch too
Holy garbage of the deepest reaches, what a great thing.
TIL Bobby Duke and I are the same age.
mind blown
Bobby you are the best and Peter definitely chose the correct artist to finish this project.  I was already following a number of the artist but now all of you guys are on my Playlist. What was decided to do with the final piece? Love ya Bobby and thanks for sharing.  Give a hug to the family, Stay safe and be well 💙 ❤️
NGL this title rubs me the wrong way
I don't remember subscribing but I somehow know why I've already done so.
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss finally
This is legit a masterpiece. Art world take notes
You should make a shirt that says Reisin, kinda like the WEWD shirt
At 0:27 you can see Patrick looking concerned at Bobby through the door😂
This video is such a journey... loved seeing your process.  Great music choices and editing.
You absolute maniac
Good grief Bobby Duke, you've gone and done it again.
I love the way he entertains us and salute to hi creativity and hard work which he did . He deserve claps(sorry for my english :) )
it looks so cool. im so glad bobby was picked to make the frame. i dont think anyone could have done it better.
Holy WOW COW Bobby.
I wawnt thayut
Does the mint green plate next to your head @ 10:26 does it glow under a black light
You're art and dedication to the process is truly an inspiration Bobby. I'm doing mine own art and seeing you go from nothing to a finished product keeps me going. Can't wait until next time.
Amazing work, i would love to see that in person. And amazing video as well, you make thousands of people laugh like crazy, thank you!
That was a buttload of greatness!!
Simply amazing Bobby, as always.
the best
Utterly Astounding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    !
be Dukie in all things.
Bobby is so funny. I love all his videos
I love how 75% of Bobby is just silly while 25% serious
Umm?!? I have no words lol can we all just take a minute and not only admire Bobby's beautifully done art but to also admire his Google search history🤣🤣🤣 "how to stop eating batteries", "can you milk a turtle" and "what to do if you poop your pants" the time and energy Bobby puts into his videos is very unappreciated!! I just have to say I love you and your videos and I can't wait for the next one!! 😘😘😘
Electricity bill be like ↗️
Does anyone know the song at the end of the video?
100% the best and coolest frame I’ve ever seen. Blows everything else I’ve ever seen out of the water. Stunning wood choice, master design work, and EXPERT use of the ‘raisin’ 👌🏼 Keep it up, Bobby!
He doesn't upload a lot but when he does it's worth it
Absolutely incredible. Even with all that procrastination, you still can make gorgeous art. Thank you for showing us the journey!
Truly amazing
Omg I’ve been waiting!!!!
Man, you are incredible
Awesome work B. Duke! Master of sculpture and twerking
This work is next level❤️❤️
And I love you too Bobby 🥺🥺
Weeee
Bobby has his own language

This is probably the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. Hair on the back of my neck stood up at the reveal. Incredible collab. You brought it all together perfectly.
AMAZING!
Oh Bobby you really went and did it this time
Awesome montage and music Bobby-pins
EPIC !!!
Who gets to keep the finished piece???
Outstanding! It's gorgeous

So cool 😆!!!!!!!! Awesome work everyone who worked on this magical piece
AMAZING!
Doood upload more
Should sell packs of those crystals in different colors
YES! BOBBY! IT'S PERFECT!!
Okay the artwork/ frame is a masterpiece. But let’s not forget the artwork that is this video. Hilarious. Beautiful. Storytelling. Just top tier Bobby!
God I love you Bobby. You are literally the best. Like,  you make me laugh so hard. And your artworks are phenomenal.  Keep up the good work Bobby ❤❤
I'm not sure putting on 6 pairs of regular glasses = safety glasses but.... seems legit
Ok
Holy shit dude
NEVER USE FAKE CRYSTALS  JUST USE REAL ONES
The humor is just as good as the art. Great work. Love this channel.
Amazing. Gotta get a bobby Duke t
Amazing
My favorite thing about you is first you make AMAZING ART and secondly your just not afraid to do something that people consider embarrassing    Your jokes and little stunts and movement across your house, yard, or lawn just makes me laugh everyday and I thank you for that Bobby Duke
amazing, soooo worth the wait
I think the lids on the cups restricted the air flow needed to cure.
Love it just Beautiful!!!
I was eating and choked hard when the crystals sent flying out of the molds.
Bobby great work love it you are very amazing stay safe and stay strong.
Bobby is a national treasure. Protect this man at all costs. Love ya Bobby 😌🤟🏽
The amount of work this man puts into a project and the video is just amazing
Dude, thanks for being you!
Damn the editing in this video is outta this world. The time it mustve taken to make that stopmotion thing with the epoxy clay crystals
He definitely ate some of that brush on silicone.
to the museum
13:31 ME AND THE BOIS  AT 3AM LOOKIN FOR.... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNSSSSS
🧑🏽‍🎨 VERY NICE 👏....  THIS WORK OF ART (DRAWINGS AND FRAME) IS PRICELESS! WHOEVER BUYS THIS....I HOPE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WILL HAVE ON THEIR HANDS... HISTORY AND...AND. I WISH IT WAS ME 😭
Dont know how this guy is thanking to us for watching his videos... we should thank him for lets us enjoy all the true art he has made all this years for free incluiding this masterpiece FFS im speechless ... You deserve every single subscriber you have and more ❤️❤️❤️ we don't care about the time you need to upload 1 video. we will be here always to support you ❤️
I have watched this piece of art go from channel to channel. Every artist leaving a little piece of themselves behind.... It was so cool. And now, my favorite Artsy-Fartsy guy ever is the one that finishes it off. I have never been more happy to be a Dookie :) This is truly beautiful.
Who keeps the art when now that its done
hoping some out those crystals are JO crystals
This is arts
The timing of that first ad was perfect
2:50 bruh that caught me so off guardddd wtf
This looks amazing! The final result gave me chills!
Where is the picture going now that it's complete? Who gets to keep it?
Just Amazing !
I never think bobby can one-up his editing and then he always proves me wrong. His consistent originality with editing Is insane!
I am so happy he has merch now. Especially that it’s called wewdshop 😂😭
Bobby. This is one of the coolest things you've ever made. I could tell it was difficult at times, hence the procrastination. It's super difficult to deal with sometimes. But your perseverance is so admirable. Also: your editing is an art form in itself. Every vid you put out has the perfect balance of silliness, kickass soundtrack and sound effects placement, creative angles for filming, etc. It's SO MUCH MORE WORK, outside of whatever piece you're doing. I hope you know how much we love and appreciate all you do to make these vids. ❤❤❤
Dude, you are an adorkable art monster! This is awesome!!!
“Is it as thicc as that twerk was?” Literally stole the video. I'm dying lol
You sir, make me want to try new things, and build all the things, but i draw the line at stop motion - that shit was guano in the best possible way.
Amazing but thats going to be hell to ship best weuishs !
The comedy and editting in this is unreal
Always a treat to watch your videos🙌🙌
Your videos are the most funniest and the most creative on YouTube!!!!!!!
So wonderful to watch
Ummm WOW!
Can I buy on ebay for $250.00? Am a bit short this month
Just WOW! Too boss for mere words
Incredible vision and beautiful work!
Okay... I will never doubt bobby again. I have to be completely honest from what I saw in part 1 I thought it was gonna look cheesy and I just wasn't liking the crystals with the cellophane or any of that reflective stuff. But seeing the end result I was 100000% wrong. That is incredible
I have now saved the clip of papi dukes twerking for “personal reasons”
9:50 NICOLE😆
I'm gonna need some of those frames for my family pics  <3  Fantastic work!
I want it so bad!!!!
this is amazing! so pretty! also random note. the platesw on your wall are so cool i like the white one with orange flowers lol, but seriously, this was so fun to watch the process and to see how you created such an amazing frame. kudos to the artists involved. the entire journey for this painting was so inspirational and so fun to watch! well done!
:0 woah
The amount of effort you put into all your work is astounding
You spoil us with how much fricken work you put into these videos. The crystal still Frame montage. Like comeone how are you not bigger then t series
I'm not sure how to feel about that intro given my name.
Bobbly puke artz
You guys are Amazing!!!
Bobby please tell me you’ll have crystals and mini frames in your shop soon! OMG I NEED IT
They should make a no man's sky 2 with that art style
What an absolutely amazing piece! I love the transition from wood to resin. Thanks for sharing your genius with us
Thanks to you!!!+
Absolutely amazing, you were the perfect person to tie this piece together!!!!
Just wow!! I remember subbing to Bobby back when he was making a necklace out of a rock on a Harbour Frieght belt sander just a few years back. I feel lucky to have been able to watch him grow his channel and as an artist.
Wont the resin go yellow?
Okay, that's a sick frame!
FAN BLOODY TASTIC. Excited every time Bobby.
Also pour those crystals and throw them in your merch shop please!
That frame is EPIC!!! And all of the work that you put into this video (editing, animation, etc) is nuts! Also you are hilarious! I’ve gotta show my boyfriend that clip of you twerking 😂
At 6:46 i died laughing, sad that I knew this reference from tiktok. If you know you know.  Your videos always make my laugh. The videos are as much art as the project.
14:50 that "heuh eheh...." feeling of "ohhh i dont know where to start." I SO FRESH IN ME RIGHT NOW. doing big projects and finishing them is bound to have lots of "IM OVERWHELMED. LET'S DO IT TOMORROW." and ending up procrastinating 2-3 business days because OVERWHELMED. and only then kicking yourself in the booty to finish it.
Lmao the sage xD
Omg I could weep that came out so beautiful!! And you didn't drop it!! You've outdone yourself!
That frame is spectacular. Almost as good as that twerk
the fleshlight joke. Lmao
Your a legend!
Mans has grey hair now🥲
Bobby your amazing, your art is inspiring, your videos are perfect for whenever I'm having a bad day. Watching your videos always brings a smile to my face.
honestly, this whole ✨masterpiece✨ deserves to be in a museum for people to look and enjoy. What a journey!
Coolest collab ever!
This man has outdone himself.
This is so amazing!! I love your videos so much, not only for your mind blowing art and creations but for your personality and spirit!
Yay
Love the pacing of your videos, like: jokes, jokes, jokes, beauty. That's the world I wanna live in!
Crazy to see the sketch come to life. And to be exactly perfect!
Amazing stuff as always Bobbert. The finished product looks great   Have you heard of the YouTube channel Evan And Katelyn? I'd love to see you guys do a collab, cause I think you would complement each other really well.  Again, well done.
I mean zero disrespect to any other art YouTuber but damn does Bobby put 150% effort  on everything he does and just kill it Everytime
Bobby you're an actual legend and you fill my soul with determination xD awesome job!!
Sir Bobby of Duke Best hands in the game Don't call it a fluke Cuz he's done it again  Built a frame out of wewd and splotched it with stain Left some room in the middle Big enough to contain  The art of the many The skill of the few Had to spend lots of money On resin and glue  So go buy his t-shirt And leave a like too He's clearly deranged Look out, he's behind you!!
Bobby, this is beautiful.
Wow, Bobby! Just. WOW!!
Flippen awesome
The transition where he pulled the screen from one side to the other was really cool.
💯👌🏽
Wow just found your channel yesterday. Literally watched Part 1 and was disappointed I’d have to wait.  And..... 4... hours.... later...   YAY!!!!!!
So much work in that.  I love the myriad of crystals with dichroic bits.
EVERYONE SHUT UP THE DUKE JUST POSTED
Love it I been following the whole start to finish on this n it’s just amazing how it turned out
Is there a way I can appreciate your work without having to go through all the unnecessary lame jokes?
You definitely ate some of that silicone
I love Bobby, he’s like the universal cool uncle😂
So awesome! The colab with such amazing artists and to have the artwork in your hands knowing that so many have put their spin on it must be so cool
Impeccable editing as always Bobby! And the final product is STUNNING 🤩
Holy shit Bobby. Thats fucking amazing. Well done my guy!
The Duke hath crystallized. Yay!!!🤩
Wow that reveal blew my mind and the finished art was incredible! Your guys are amazing!?
11:38😂😂🤣😅😅🤣😂
Yo Mr. White, you wanna make some crystal?
You Are My Favorite
Your editing is so fun. It matches the energy you put into your art
I said it before and I'll say it again (atleast I think I have). Mr. B. Duke makes the best artistic / educational videos around. So frickin' unique. That whole collab project is epic as heck!
That is one complicated project well done!!
are we going to ignore the fact that he just threw it back in our face
"the cone that is silly"  His autosuggestion on Google during the ad  😂🤣😂🤣😂
I woulda used some transparent purple dye for the resin for the crystals, personally, but think that they still turned out amazingly! Nicely done, Bobby.
I'm laughing so much at the "and now it's night... Because I procrastinated. And now it's the next day"
i actually think this is the best piece of art ive ever laid my eyes on
Your the best guy ever mate
I just want to know what the ending song is called.
Well worth the wait. Minus 2 weeks. Sorry Bobby,  but I just can't wait for the next video. So creative, and funny. So much talent.
Holy heck son!  Sheesh, I didn’t realize how perfectionist you are.  My good golly Mr. Bobby!  That came out beautifully and PERFECTLY!
Question, what made you go with the apoxie clay if you were just going to use to make squares that you then sand down? Couldn't you have used wood for that? Especially since you coated with clear coat before making molds.  (Please be kind oh wise Dukey, I know you have your reasons, I only ask so I can learn)
Nice princess bride reference
Bobby duke's posh voice kindof sounds like stolas
this mf weird (in a good way)
This art frame is absolutely beautiful
It’s always a huge treat when Bobby posts.
You always surprise and delight with the little things you add to your videos!  Like the stop motion crystals moving around
I always love tge editing. It keeps the video fun and fresh!
The Dukey is getting serious with those diamond glowy eyes and voice drop!
Most awesome!!
Always love the Dukey!
Best vid 1 recap.
Nice and amazing end for the best Collab
A Dukey upload, a Dukey upload!!!  The internet and economy stalls to watch
Dukey, my Dukey. Thou art truly a national treasure, of art… artistry… artist… something with a.
Holy shneikies that's awesome!  Amazing work as always dude!
This is fn insane!!! You KILLED IT!!!!!
Beautiful! How do you keep the skin on your knuckles.....on?
Yay new video!!
Great Work!! 💯 Turnout Amazing. 🤩
Absolutely beautiful piece! my dad and I always look forward to your videos and they allow us to bond over something we both love and can laugh together so thank you for that.
Amazing!
This is legitimately the coolest thing I've ever seen. The video, production and finished product. Pure genius at every level. 👏
I swear ship station sounds like something else maybe a high fiber product
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
It's picture frame porn. I feel naughty. Thank you my good sir for leaving me entertained.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME DUDE?! You smashed this. Everyone smashed this. This looks so damn beautiful 😭💖
2am brain, I was looking away and heard shit station, shit more with shit station
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
so many years have passed since part 1 i don't remember who you are....
oh men! if i have money i will place bid no matter how much it is... just to get that master piece! ❤️
damn thats sick
anyone know where i can find that shirt bobby's wearing?
I know that stop motion section at 3:37 took forever lol
I’m sorry for the evil things I ever said😢😢😢😢😪
Hnnnggh! HHNNNNGGGHHH!!!!
That silly cone looks like orange mandarin yogurt, I want that. Just bought 2 Shirts, I will hardly ever wear one of them, but the other will go on my wall, cause your art is awesome. And I want to see more of Bobby duke arts. Love your goofy ass. keep making me laugh, and I'll keep buying shit from you.
That looks absolutely amazing! :0 The skills are unreal bro
Nice job.ww
happy chinese new year sir :0
Dude, you and your art are amazing!
"Oh yay" *click*  *yt premium ad comes on perfectly timed*
Just Beuwtiful!!👌
Holy crap this is freaking gorgeous!
Incredibly stunning ❣❣❣😍👏👏🥰
Epic!!! Who keeps it now?
BOBBY IS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKK I LURV U
W.O.W. That is freaking amazing! Not only is the frame straight up gorgeous, it is a lovely thematic extension to the painting. It is less a frame than a final 3D component of the art. Wonderful. Well done.
And yes it’s an NFT…
you're an absolutely incredible artist-God bless you!
Not to take away from the piece, but can someone hook me up with the music?
Wow this turned out spectacular!!
Absolutely amazing! I literally gasped when you lit it up...incredible.
i cant believe the work he does
Why is there a piece of tape on the painting? What is the meaning of the painting anyway, if it has one?
That is the coolest thing I have ever seen.
That is INSANE
Wow just wow bobby crushed it mate!
I’ve been waiting for this!!! Nicely done, sir!
Holy cows this is amazing!!!  This is absolutely the perfect end to this epic collaboration.
You seriously outdid yourself on this one duder, gorgeous work.
The way you strive for absolutely perfect and detailed results, put an insane amount of hard work into your craft and still find time to do and edit in all those fun shenanigans is insane!   We're incredibly lucky we get all of this, thank you for sharing it with us💛  (The frame looks freaking fantastic so far, I'm not even done w the video!!🤣💛)
Bobby of all the fantastic and amazing things you have made this frame is by far one of my personal favorites
I cackled when he shot the crystals out of the molds with the air gun and scared my dog 😂
I can’t imagine how much work into making that stop motion of the crystals moving, it looks spectacular!
FINALLY, only 3 weeks later...
"Thick as that twerk." I love your wife. That was funny.
Why is no one talking about the piece of tape
Anyone else pause the video to buy merch or just me lol
hey bro, pass that cleanse here
People standing beside you must be able to hear the buzzing in your brain!  You are a genius!!
It's perfect, BD.
Hey Bobby, when you were planning did you ever think about the option of making the crystals out of the clay before the frame and pour into one piece before you made the frame so you could just pour one continuous piece of resin? I know there are downsides just wondering how your thought process went.
Glad you didnt drop this one on the shoot 😂😂 Awesome Vid!
Outstanding artistry,  as always,  Bobby! It's beyond beautiful!
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT Job Dobby Buke...... You are a genius mad scientist 🤘❤️❤️🤘
I don’t remember when last time any youtuber has made me giggle spontanious like Bobby did on this video 😂😂
Wow! The wait was so totally worth it! Bobby, you are amazing! And your editing in the video was beyond great! Absolutely amazing job!!
bobby always awesome work love it and love the jokes you're my top artist channel on YouTube
best YouTuber ever I love your videos
See you can’t get this level of quality hard honest work from an NFT.
Well worth the wait great job.
Bobby. We need to talk. Its important. I would really like to give you some money but the merch shop doesn't have my size as an option. please. please please tell me there's something we can do about this.
I love the final song, does anybody know the name of it?
may i ask what song that is when you start sanding the crystals?
Godddd it's so bloody beautiful
awesome stop motion
Finally!!
This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen and that’s saying something
Such an amazing idea
That thing is effing beautiful
Holy shit....
Why did some have duck tape on them?
I’d give this another like if I could. Fantastic production values in the video, and the frame itself is incredible and a very fitting addition to this collaborative project. Congratulations to all involved. I look forward to the next one :)
Got damn, that's cool af
11:39 me too brother
Wow, Bobby, you did it! The frame is definitely the best part now, like dayummmmnnnn
Omggggg it is freaking Amazing!!!!! This is absolutely gorgeous in every way! Who ever can afford that is the luckiest art collector in the world!!!
Hey all, I'm not on any socials - can someone fill me in on where this amazing finished product is headed? Is it a charity piece or getting auctioned or perhaps a bday pressie for the Queen? This is the exact opposite of an NFT and must be worth a fortune!
Bobby you did it again. Masterpiece
Wow! Just wow! It looks so amazing! You were trying to make a frame worthy of the artwork, now I wonder if the artwork is worthy of the frame! Complements to all the artists that put their time and effort into this project!
“Is it as thicc as that twerk was?” 😂 That’s a mighty fine wewd and raisin frame. Beautiful! Edit: also, the reveal was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen
That is the greatest piece of art I have ever seen. Bobby... you've done it again! Off to the merch store
I knew it would be good, but still you have surpassed all expectations! It flows with the content of the painting so well it's hard to believe
I hate it when his videos are so good that i know I'll like it before even watching, so i usually press like just as the video starts, but then after the video ends i press like again because i forgot i already pressed like, then I'll have to press like a third time because i want my like to stay.
my jaw DROPPED when I saw the lit up reveal
Duke did not mentally breakdown during the making of the Frame.
Yeah...the Obvious Truth is...there is Nothing you can't make....Bobby Duke is The Magic Man
truly one master piece of the channel!
That google search history!!! LOL
I make things the way I want them to look too, I guess we have that in common mr duke. Ha Bobby?
I’ve been checking daily and finally you did it!!!!
one of the world's most valuable frame: over 2 millions (us$) with at list 10 000 diamonds on it  this frame:  clickbait with led and a lot of resin  just to ruin this amazing painting
Sick!!! Man that is the coolest dadgum piece of art 🤘
Definitely one of the strangest and most entertaining creative content providers on YT.  👍🤪👍
Talent, humor and a role model I am proud for my kids to watch. I get giddy when I see a new Bobby Duke video has dropped.
Seeing the process of the things you make is so amazing. From idea to final piece, it’s honestly so cool!
I want copies of the crystals or their molds omfg 😭😂😭😂😭😂❤️❤️
Bobbert, you have outdone yourself👏🏻
the frame and art is gorgeous, but that stop motion. GOSH DANG, BOBBY
That's amazing! What is going to happen to this piece now that it's complete? O_O
Just absolutely mind blowing, the talent and mastery of materials & techniques put into this painting and it's frame are from another planet. Thank you for sharing.
This was so cool
I always feel like I'm hallucinating when I watch this channel then a split second of horrifying editing 1:24 shakes me to my core and sets me on edge for the rest of the video 😅
After watching most of your videos, it still stuns me just how good of an artist you are. All I have to say about this frame is, "Holy ****"
That is the most beautiful frame! I love what you did with the crystals!
Totally acceptable to wear a ten hun shirt multiple times in a row 😂
Extraordinary work Bobby!
OMG OMG OMG!!!! 😜
I've considered going pro, but right now I'm still amateur-crastinating.
Wow that is so sick! You are amazing that frame is incredible 🤩🤩💜💙💜💙
Wow ! What a special surprise. I think you did some amazing job on the frame. Whole lot of time. I enjoyed every second of it. Thank you all for making this one of a kind truly amazing masterpiece  ❤❤❤ Thanks for many giggles.
This piece is like the super duper concetraded nectar of the best artists on youtube now. You guys are in another level of reality. Love it.
soooooooo cool
worth the wait
the final result is so fricken amazing, is it still being auctioned for charity?
Yeah that's cool but... is there an NFT version of it?
He, the embodiment of creativity and all the skills to make it happen, is the actual dream of all artists
Worth the wait. It is epic❣️❤️❣️❤️❣️
Man I wish I could buy your art!!!! Or had a house to put it in.....
Poderia ter legendas em português
awesome work !
😂 Lmao! Gold, brother 💚
This.  Is.  E.P.I.C.
I love this channel so much
That is absolutely awesomely insane. Well done Mr. Duke, well done. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Watching this project progress has been an amazing experience. Bobby this frame is fantastically epic, the perfect proverbial cherry on top!
Bobby just keeps one-upping his work and  you can see how much hard work goes into each segment for the content and spice of comedy and I love that so much.
Love your goofy antics always helps me when im feeling depressed thank you and hope your doing well with your depression
This is amazing!!!!!
DUDE, THAT IS SIC!💥💥
I love the way his brain works.
Crooks and nannies if my new favorite term
You are honestly one of the most talented artists of our generation. And this piece is truly stunning, the effort you put in to make it makes it even more special and valueble, it is just mindblowing how patient you are and how vivid your imagination is!
hello sir i think you have adhd
I haven't even watched the video to the end, but holy shit you've really put A LOT of work into this.  And I mean - just the video itself, the little skits, the editing, THE DAMN STOP MOTION PART - it must've taken weeks to put this whole thing together!  Love your work. And love your weird cuts and humor. My short attention span thanks you.
OMG 😱 😍🤯So incredibly gorgeous.  Please do a collaboration every year.  So much talent came together for this amazing project.
Brilliant 👍🇦🇺
That looks  so good. Keep up the good work.
I would buy the shirt but the fact ten hundred get's a percentage. Nope. He made over a million dollars on Patreon. All the profits should go to Bobby
Never disappointed
Hi Bobby, it turned out awesome as expected.  In one of my comment on your video, a fake Bobby Duke Arts. was asking me to buy cryptocurrency😂
Whoa! That is an epic art piece. You framed the artwork beautifully.
Your artistry is insane!!! 😍
How to stop eating batteries Can you milk a turtle? What to do if you poop your pants  Thank you for sharing your search history with us
I'm new here, just too impressed with the frame AND those video editing skills!!!!!  Awesome job.
💜💜💜
Outstanding!
جميل
I didn’t think it was possible to make frame that would perfectly compliment that piece but dang flippin’ floop if you didn’t knock it out of the galaxy! Absolutely incredible!
This is pretty much the most impressive video I have ever seen by any YouTube creator ever. Much respect. It´s an incredible piece!
Look out Logan Paul, Bobby is coming for that glass breaking record.
I am always left in amazement with how you manage to mix the arts with the farts😂 top notch!
What happened to your heterosexual twin brother, the one who made the first videos in the channel?
'is that stupid?' yeah, your whole channel, thata why i love it
Ever made an apple head lol
I wish he would make these crystal molds purchasable. I would love to have them.
havent watched you in forever man, glad to see your videos come back up in my recommended agin
the crystals are amazing!!!
I really thought the frame would outshine the artwork but it fits so seamlessly with everything else’s work. Everything goes together so well that it works as one piece but you can still see everyone’s individual skills and style shine through. I loved how it all turned out! And I love the crystals on the frame!
I don't know what's better: The frame, or your epic editing!!!
I to am lazy and disgusting:)
This is fantastic. Thank you for giving everyone proper credit
My heart stopped when I saw you put the artwork on the routing table, but the LED strip looks awesome!
The Bernadette Banner vibes were real for a bit, love it lol
So awesome. It is one thing to have a vision. But a completely other to make it come true with the abilities and tools which one has. I always like to watch Bobbys videos since they are funny and creative. A rare gem to find. Thank you for sharing this.
holyyy fudge... that's amazing 😱😱😳💗❤️
Oh my God. I had high expectations sir. You exceeded them. Absolutely stunning.
Gotta thank Ten Hundred, we got two videos out of this one project 😍
CAN SOMEONE PLS TELL ME THE SONG THAT STARTS AT 13:34 . also this turned out so sick worth the wait for sure
For every project you should make a mini plate version for the wall 👌
Finally sir bobby wewdy upload part 2...and the result..always epic..
Bobitty bobs! you knocked this out of the park, such a dope frame
This was so worth the wait, I love this so much
Pleeeeease can you forge the One Ring from LOTR?
Genius
A Bjord.
Bobby it’s 2022 not 2021
Would love to see reaction Videos of all the artists who were a part of this Colab. If we were awestruck by it imagine them. Amazing work Bobby when i saw part one i knew they couldnt have chosen anyone better to finish this off and this just proved it!
amazing end to an amazing mega-collab!  Epic!
You make the voices in my head chuckle. Thanks for the great content.
Ok, now start with a frame and go backwards. =J
Your talent is UNREAL !
I wish you could relive experiences, because this piece's journey has had me hooked for months, all the way from the first Ten Hun video. What a beautiful creation!
I dare you to do a timelapse with the minecraft speedrun music... Do it Bobby.
Awesome video, very well done!
Bobby Duke, now as Whiskey Grampaw!
It is gorgeous just like you Bobby
The Frame is so pretty!! So is the art!
Can you slam resin like brownie batter in a pan to get the bubbles up?  Don't do it to a baby, though, they don't like that.
I used shipstation for my mom for a little bit, and I can say its really good
Your frame is absolutely glorious! They picked the right guy. I was framed once. It wasn’t as pretty.
Your frame looks amazing and really sets off the picture collaboration.   Yeah!
Good job Bobby :)
Some really interesting, entertaining and truly bootyful collab content.
6:46 BOBBY NO, That caught of guard, if you know this audio
When you casually mention the pic of destiny like wow day made
Dude...every frame is fanfunkintastic! Of the video....every frame of the video...and the Frame, it's great as well ;D
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!! AMAZING!
You need to set up a live as you work so people could supper chat you Bobby
That is really beautiful
That is amazing that frame you did just was the icing on the cake for that panting good no grate job to you and everyone who did their art it just blew me away to see it finly done
3:38 is incredible, can't imagine how long it took to make this awesome clip
👍
Love from india
@ 2:50 LoL!
I wish I could hit like a hundred times on this video it's so awesome keep up the good work
How to stop eating banananas? Y'all right there, Bobby?
Praise The Sun dookie-boy.
Sooooo... Titillating..!? The holes, crystals, and foil complement the color palette of the piece so well! And that dark wood with the lit up crystal corner balance perfectly, chef's kiss. Wish I could own this.. to light up the runway with something from my personal collection. kek, nice one.
You inspire me. Your videos, your channel, your job.. Thanks, Duke! And greetings from Brazil.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! It's FINALLY HERE!  Omg Its beautiful! 😍💜 Such great work, we appreciate youuuuu!
6:46 funniest part of the video if you get it
he wrote 2021 even though it's 2022...
Bad ass.... that is all
Bobby, I would say that you should run for President of Procrastinators United but the voting is always postponed for some reason. Maybe tomorrow.
WOW! What a finale, what a painting, what project -  It is AMAZING This is such a fantastically produced mastah piece  *chef's kiss
Are you willing to trade Chik-fil-A sauce for it?
I don't know what is more impressive the actual frame or bobby Duke's filming/ editing, but either way great job on both for part one and definitely the second part for this epic project. 🔥🤘🔥
It looks awesome, Bobby !! Thanks for sharing
Probably like the best video ever made 👊🏼💯
3:38 how long did that stop motion take to film?
The only word that uses to describe    this is ( wow)
That truly is a feast for the eyes , 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
I love how Bobby doesn't settle for things. He puts the time and effort into making things. People usually go for easy and okay. Bobby goes for perfect which is hard. I also love how he talks about him procrastinating. It's common but people usually only show the actual work so it shows kids that they are supposed to be able to do it without problems
The editing is beautiful and the hand crafts are flawless! Beautiful!!!
wa sus!
This should be sent to a museum
"and now it's night because I procrastinated" Relatable af
The video editing is just glorious
So who gets to keep it?
That 2:52 sequence is so satisfying...
Bobby and his wife have such a great relationship! Honestly goals.
My jaw is literally on the floor!!!! You were the perfect person to create this frame!! What a fukin masterpiece!!!!
I was waiting for this so much!!! It turns out amazing, Bobby!!!! So happy you took part on this project!
Yep you added the twerking music too
The frame matches PERFECTLY dude! Huge kudos omg!!!
BADASS!!! great job Bobby !
He so naughty hehehe
🥰 Soooooooo Loving your channel Bobby!!! You work so hard on your content! Thanks for giving “goofy” a home and sharing it with Us! Oh and then your Artistic🤩ShutUp!!! You talented Bastard!!!! 🥸😍
@Bobby Ive always loved your videos, but  have to tell you brother, the quality of your videos has been going way up with every episode. I watched some of your old stuff yesterday that I still enjoy and then seeing this one today, its beautiful to see how you've evolved,  Good job, thank you for keeping us entertained!
Big fan of MS Paint. The project turned out awesome.  Great use of wewd and not wewd  Resin time, resin time, do do do do, resin time
That is sick!  In the positive trendy young people’s way…  I should hire you to frame my paintings!
Perfect !
How he designs something and then he sticks to the plan and executes it perfectly using MS paint blows my mind... I am an engineer and I am impressed, I usually end up improvising more using way more complex tools. Amazing
Can we all agree that Bobby needs to edit all YouTube videos on YouTube from now on.  Love your work Duke.
Not plastic or wewd...plewd?
Priceless work of art
man. thank you
7:14 TOOL - Lateralus vinyl on the shelf. Respect.
This whole entire piece. Is UTTERLY priceless. What a beautiful collaborative result. 10/10
m a g n i f i c e n t
Wow 👍😳 you really hit this one out of the park.
For all your merchandise needs you should use bunker branding, they are based in Texas and is youtuber merch made by youtubers
I know you wont see this Bobby, but the amount of time, effort, and comedy you put into your videos never ceases to amaze me. You are able to create things that I couldnt even begin to THINK about and after hard work make it into something amazing. Thank you so much for posting and spending time, not cutting corners, and making a hilarious video every time! Love ya
The stop motion of the grey crystals makes my brain SO happy you've no idea. If you ever asked yourself while making that if it was worth it
Awesome
This looks amazing! The pearlescent effect in the resin turned out really cool, good job!
Toàn đá quí
EPIC. As per usual Sir Bobby Duke.
YEEEESSSSSS!!! So happy im nat 3 days late on this video!!!
That turned out wonderfully, as always Bobby Duke. Freaking Fantastic sir!!
That...is...AWESOME!
Ooooooooooh amazing work of art!
You... Yes You Bobby Duke are the most superduperpeemypantsfunniestmostamazingartist {this is now a word}! Who knew that mixed media art and comedy would be so Fantastic together!!! You are a natural.
Amazing, Fantastic well done bobby
The procrastination joke got me deep 😂😂
I knew you’d knock it out of the park. The whole piece is amazing, I’m so glad they asked you to complete it.
I always saw Bobby as a funny pg13 YouTube until I saw the "light up the runway with something from my personal collection" came up, I about died laughing I freaking love this dude
NO WAY THATS THE BEST AD SEGWAY IVE EVER SEEN NO ONE HAS EVER GONE FROM A MERCH PLUG INTO A SPONSORSHIP YOURE A GENIUS
Holy sh$t wewd you look at that!!! Epic. Just epic.
What a way to kick off 2022. You absolutely out did yourself Bobby! The way it lights up the crystals so nicely is incredible!
This is incredible! not only is the frame and art absolutely stunning, but I also love bobby's humor. thanks for making me smile!
You sir, are an artsy craftsy madman! That is 100% the coolest frame I have ever seen!!! I bought 1 of your new t-shirts and can't wait to wear it!! Love you Bobby, Mrs Bobby, Bobby Jr's and Bobby critters!!!
Well this is truly epic🙏🏼
It's like my mom, I don't have OCD I'm a hyper perfectionist but I think they're the same thing LoL 🤣 Edit: I love your videos Bobby, you're so good at art and also hilarious 😂
Brilliant!
It’s absolutely perfect and amazing. It completes it.
Who's going to keep it? It will go a museum of some kind? It's fucking beautiful.
I love you to death, Bobby, but this project disgusts me. Not sure if anyone is aware, but people of COLOR are part of the YouTube art community too. This whole thing was just another white guy ego boost.
You were the only one I watched it involved with this project
is this piece for sale? :o  i want that.
SO HAPPPPY WITH HOW THIS ALL TURNED OUT!!!! LOOKS AMAZINGGGG!!
6:46 After googling what this reference was, all I have to say is, why.
Can we all agree that Bobby Dukes just freakin' amazing? Not only is he extremely talented and artistic but also hilarious and adorable?! The frame took the art piece to the next level!!
thank you but its still not over it needs to be sold to the highest bitter and donated and live on in history lol the world keeps spinning lol life goes on and on and on. we must stay healthy for moments like theses keep it 100
So… who gets it?
Wow Such a magnificient art and frame, and you did such a good work at complementing the painting with the frame! The wood and water being in the same corner, The wood stopping at the crow's height and similarly at the leprechaun head on the other side. The painting is great but the frame really helps accentuate this curve-flow from the top left to botton right, with space above. I don't think I've seen many frames complement art like that much often at all, it's insane! Loving the final result, well freaking done to all of you, really!
A frame is as important as the artwork. Different frames are doing different jobs for the art. This frame nailed it!
Aaaw shucks ...  it's over now ...
Stunning frame! My favorite piece on art on the whole piece!
Nothing like watching some crazy obsessed wood person on the internet make shiny rocks and put them on a picture frame.
Love the totally secure photo session at the end there. Jab jab.  Seriously tho Bobby you are amazing. Your talent, attention to detail, artistry, and hilarious videos make me so happy. Thank you for sharing.
WOAH!!!
It was the cleansing for me 😂
The amount of work that went into this... wow!  The final shot of everything together... absolutely stunning!  That raisin is looking good✨
10:25 my man made a Clayton Reference
😁 Happy to see this. Awesome frame and video 👏👏👏
holy SHIT Bobby!!! i thought i was the biggest perfectionist who always chooses the hardest possible route because this is the only way it will be B E A U T I F U L but nah you outdo me by several acres. Fucking beautiful man
No Bobby, you cannot eat a turtle.
That is the most epic frame ever. The whole art piece is just awesome. I can’t wait to see what charity is going to benefit.
Your merch should be good photos of your art...... duh. I'd buy shirts with YOUR art on them.
Thanks for making me smile 😃  What a beautiful frame for an awesome piece of art, great job everyone 👏
Amazing frame for amazing art! I love the shiny paper in the crystals - it makes them so SHINY! And the reveal with the lights!!! You know how to make a great moment on film. Great work - to you and all the artists involved.
did bobby praise the sun
Hugs.
Love the crystals
2:23 "Give me a second, I need to get my story straight"
You were clearly the right person for this collab. The panting is amazing, and the frame doesn't take away from anyone else's work, it highlights and enhances it. That's the mark of a true artist in my opinion, great work Bobby!
Best joke at 6:46
That is so cool and beautiful, and I would like to take this time to appreciate how long this took and how amazing it turned out!
Absolutely beautiful!
Amazing artists! Amazing piece of art! It should be in the permanent collection of MOMA
Omg!!!! The fraim looks so damn cool! Bobby you have out done yourself it looks incredible
Holy I bet that stop motion took almost as long as the frame 🤯
The featured art piece is pretty cool, but it doesn't deserve such an outstanding frame. Nothing does. It's a total masterpiece all on its own.
The crystal montage music was banger!
I know exactly what you mean when talking about the turnout being exactly like you want it. I call it ocd about adhd arting. I’m learning to not be so critical of my work. When you get into something, I know it will talk to someone. Every person like something different. Your work is beautiful. The frame couldn’t be more better suited. The frame itself, wouldn’t look right on anything except what you made it for. I love the humor and attitude that you put across. The goofball is definitely strong within you. Don’t change it for anyone.
*WEWD is Love WEWD is life*
I wonder how much this piece would be worth. Could probably make a lot of money at a charity auction
magnificent
Amazing 👏👏👏
4:00 Wow that was a REALLY cool effect!! Never seen something like that before!!
I realize you put your life into your work, but damnit Bobby we need you to post MORE! 🔥🔥🔥
Was it worth the effort? Yes. Yes it was. Subscribed and blood pledge made.
OH MY GOOD GRACIOUS LORD HEAVEN ABOVE!!! THAT IS LITERALLY THE BEST.... That is all I can say! Ok one more thing.. AMAZING 😍
E P I C ! As always ;)
see what'd I say? t'was some of the best 6 seconds :) no joke though the fact that you took all that time to do the stop motion just for the video is next level dedication to your craft
I first saw the piece on NerdForge and followed the progress - and this was the perfect ending! Absolutely the most amazing frame I'm ever likely to see!
I can totally see this hanging in the Louvre w/ the Statue of David... Downside is that it's hanging off the end of his penis, but it's still in the Louvre.
The video editing itself is entertainment at its finest!
How's the Universe?  Screaming "Wait" just before the commercial stopped every ounce of joy in it's tracks?
Ahhh the Bobby Duke itch has been scratched.  Excellent video.
ULTRA SICK!!
2:50 iconic
We waited this long all for him to make that stop motion portion of the crystals lol. Love it!! ❤️
1000% worth the wait!!! This is the loveliest crafted peice of anything I've ever seen!!
Awesome
Outstanding Dukie outstanding!
They say nothing is perfect in this world.... Guess they haven't seen this artwork yet.
2:21 🎶Give me a second I... I need to get my story straight🎶
Does anyone knoe what song plays in the end? I really like it
I love you Bobby
Amazing
Mrs. Duke "Is it... Thiccset?" ;-)
Dude!!! That's amazing!!!! One of your best projects yet!!! Nice job:) also bobby, nice dance moves ;)
9:16 I love the new Breaking Bad season
ME:  (TALKING TO THE BETTER HALF OF THE UNIVERSE TO DIVERT THEIR ATTENTION FROM THE TASTY MEAL I'D MAKE) I wanna watch this vid of this amazing artist ...  I've got to see the most World Famous thingy  ...  (I burst out laughing hysterically, hardly getting the words out, thinking about my own online persona) ... He's had a nervous breakdown or two on the internet (I carry on laughing hysterically before going dead quiet realizing I'm in an empty space ...)  ( )
4:04 rip lamp
Phenomenal😍
This turned out SO COOL 💖✨😭✨
Bobby that is amazing so beautiful well done everyone love it 😍
It's so cool!!
I love your videos! You make these projects and videos seem so effortless when they really take hours of hard work.
Bobby Duke asking if something is stupid must be a rhetorical question....but those are the most we find the most entertaining
WOAH   I waent that
Great job once again Bobby! And gives me great ideas for my current project. Thank you for sharing your awesomeness.
Imo the frame is the best part!
I had high hopes it was gonna be dope and you definitely didn’t disappoint Bobby !!! You da man
Fuckin dope
You are simply the best
Bobby is the epitome of quality over quantity.
As a custom framer by trade, may I say HOLY BALLS?! Seriously, I got chills on that reveal.   I initially started following Ten Hun after you gave his BD art that shoutout, so it feels right that you would bring this home. I never doubted you would do it justice, but you truly knocked it out. 3ff yeah, Bobby Dee. Forever a legend!
I’ve been waiting for part 2, this is exciting! I feel like this project was a lot of stress for you Bobby lol. Maybe next video you could just call “Some wewd fun” or something and just make a bunch of little creations out of wewd. Since that seems to be your happy place haha
Anyone else get tripophobia from the molds? no, just me?
Holy Shit!!! 1 of the few times where the frame is almost more impressive the the artwork it frames, also the amount of work you did on stop motion sections is crazy.
I'm a professional custom framer. This is the sickest thing I've ever seen.
I can relate to 4:48 so well.  Bobby makes unimaginable art while also keeping it real. ♥
Just like everything else you make, i want it so badly!!!
Yaaaay! I LOVE when your posts come up on my feed! Bobby, you’re incredible. ☺️
Awesome! Beautiful! Wow!!!! I love it, what an amazing idea, combining the creative talents of so many awesome people who share the process of this piece's journey... So special, and Sir Bobbem of Duketh is most certainly the icing on that twerky cake
10:59 I agree with that guy, I hate wait too XD
Maybe sell that thing for carity. It is amazing!
This turned out perfectly!!! 🤩💜
This is absolutely amazing and well worth the wait
No I didn't try to pause the screen at the exact moment Bobby's suggested search results populated.. but if I did.. 10/10 would do again 🤣
thats fucking awesome
That frame is outstanding! The video content is just as brilliantly creative and entertaining.  Bobby, you are a genius my friend.
Hey Bobby, I want you to know this isn't something I'm in the habit of saying to people I've never met, but you are pretty damn awesome. You give me maker envy, and inspire me to build more crazy shit to blow people's minds. Keep it up!
Wew
this guy is so fun
"and now its night, because i procrastinated" ~Bobby Duke  this is probably the most relatable thing i've heard today
That frame is the perfect balance of art piece by itself, and craft worthy of the art it frames. Really cool to see the final icing on the cake for this massive collab... Unless someone is going to be building a display case to put the framed piece in.
That frame is SICK. It's also amazing and really, really good.
How you pluck your visions from your head and near flawlessly compose them into existence is mind boggling. Wicked awesome project. 👏 👏 👏
Perfect
The most epic ending to this amazing project!
Absolutely gorgeous!! ❤️👍
HOLY SMOKES! That's *disrespectfully* good man!
damn you really went all out
I love watching your videos! And love your artistic work. Looking forward to more videos
*drops it*
Incredible work, Bobby! Just awesome all around. I think you're so great.
This content never gets old. The comedy is gold
I won't be able to get it on the auction, but I swear I will become rich enough to buy it from whoever wins the auction
Really smashed it on the frame, properly brought the piece together! Would love to see more work with you using that iridescent foil!
satisfying to watch you work as always ( ~w~)
insane
0:28 Patrick sitting in the doorway watching you is pure sadgeness
11:30 Dude, all the fart sound effects are cracking me up.  I am a child.
13:37 Oh my god this is really beautiful❤❤❤. I love you Bobby D.
"One question:  is it as thick as that twerk was?"  I wheezed :D
Dude, I've literally never clicked on anything quicker.
Wow Bobby that frame is literally perfect for the art work shit what am I talking about I mean the art work compliments your frame well done buddy your videos always give me a smile.   Keep up the good work.
Absolutely love how the frame is made very unique and beautiful! also loved to see you twerk lol
I stopped following this painting for a while until this popped up … this is the coolest , honestly , the coolest painting
I wants thayyyt!! Bobby, you're a G D national treasure and we all love you 😍
I feel like your shirt (which is really awesome by the way) looks like an nft. But hey, I’d buy the nft if I had the money
Dude.... Incredible shirt ordered 👍🏻
Stunning!  Not only is the frame amazing art on it's own, it does what a good frame should, takes the thing it's framing to the next level.  Awesome as always, Bobby!
The stop motion though!
Yesssssssssss!.. Wewd....
6:45 appreciate the joke there lmfao
Bobby, the world always needs just a little more of you.  Much love from Israel.   This has been a rough time and I’d say you made me smile, but you made me pee myself laughing several times in a single video. ❤️🇮🇱
That frame is freaky! Came out great. Superb craftsmanship. Really suits the artwork
Amazing work Bobby! But I have to say that I was having flashbacks of the bucket sculpture toward the end when you were holding it up.
You always have the best videos!! Had to go back and re-watch part 1 before watching this one!! It's absolutely insanely gorgeous!! Your talent is above and beyond!!
Looks like if it was made by the Gods. Also you are so funny, love your videos.
I aspire to be at least half as skilled as you are one day, amazing stuff. Also thanks for showing your methods of making custom epoxy crystals, that's super helpful :D
Don't forget the like!! muchos likes!!
Holy moly that stop motion clip must've taken FOREVER to film, I'm as impressed by that as I am the gorgeous frame!
damn that stop motion be SMOOTH
It's freakin' SICK!!!!! OMG this is AMAZING!!!! Peter should be shocked!
Yeah, when it comes to making crystal stuff, you're basically left with two options, you make them or you grow them. And ... i think i know two people on this planet that can grow crystals into existing structures, both quit out of madness induced anger.
INCREDIBLE!!!
Amazing artistry, worth the wait
I can't believe how well that frame ties the entire piece together, it just fits so well with everyone else's work
Insane...
Camera woman is on fire, can we have more of her? <3   Love the final outcome, it really ties the whole project together!
Absolutely stunning! Wow! Wasnt expecting that
They look like the crystals from Crash Bandicoot 😭😭
Bobby you are amazeballs
How many mugs were harmed in the making of this video? Also loved it so much, keep on making great stuff and somewhat tolerable dad jokes lol
my jaw ACTUALLY dropped when I saw the final product. It is beautiful!
It was alreay an amazing piece and now it's spectacular.
Wow you're extraordinary Mr Dukey, what an amazing frame!
this is f***ing awesome !!! <3
The frame ties everything together so so well!!! Just absolutely killing it!
There's no link to part 2 in the description here
Super sick but doesn’t feel like it fits the overall piece to well
The drawing was just a reference, you maniac.
What a master piece, kudos Mr Bobby 👍😊🗿🦖🦤😻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Don’t know which part I loved more… the stop motion crystals or your wife roasting you! LOL Either way, thank you for adding your wonderful brain smarts and wewd working to this iconic piece! I’m a huge fan of Peter too, so it’s a thrill when my fav makers collab on a piece!
Bobby could make his own language and no one would stop him
Oh man. That process was long and so detailed! The finished product is amazing!!!!!! I love all the crystals!
I have trypophobia and was not ready for 6:54 🤢  (The fleshy pink color isn't helping either)
3:00 and 11:20 what are those songs?
bobby is truly my chaotic internet dad, he makes me feel so good about myself as a fellow adhd ridden artist, feels like looking into a mirror and liking what you see :)
4:55 S tier content
Omg you're a legend
Where can i buy the picture?
At first your vision was a bit foggy, but now it's crustal clear. Awesome
This frame is just as breathtaking as the piece itself! It is an absolutely incredible piece of art!
Just A M A Z I N G !!
Thank you for being the best content creator on this platform, Your videos are the most entertaining, inspiring and joyful here ^^
Much respect all of other artists are dope as well such a great collab
So who gets to keep it? 👀
your perfectionism is crazy... but worthy it, its amazing
Bobby twerking has got to be the best thing that i've seen in a long while.
Soooooo... That artwork is clearly a one-off. Will it be sold?
Amaziiiing as ever 🤩 Sooooo trippy 😍 ❤️👍🏼
Hello Bobby, how are you doing today?
Being on this channel since the 100k sub and seing how big and far Bobby have came to be is making me feel proud somehow that I've been part of this journey ❤ ❤
i wish i could get my hands on it, but due to all the colabs in my opinion the best way would be to do charity auction and donate the results of it
Lazy and disgusting? No. nada. never. More like flipping amazing, talented, genius, and a superior artist.
Finally  The Rock voice*
Over the years, his raunchy him our has got more clearly and but more sly. at an abundance at this point. And I got to say, it’s why I love these videos 😂
Epic
This dude is equal parts weird, creative and super sweet. It's so good.
Dope video + twerk lessons. Bobby Dewk never fails to entertain us.
This is amazing!!! You are an art God
This dude is awesome.
This is insane! Absolutely gorgeous work! Every step of this was so tedious to complete and he went through all of that for the vision he had, and I just have so much respect. No shortcuts were taken
Your videos are amazing.  I laugh every time you say “wood”.  Keep making stuff and I’ll keep watching!
Hey Bobby...have my kids.
That was so cooooollllll
amaaaaazing <333
4:50 Man he jus like me fr
You are so incredible at what you do!! You spend so much time making your art and also spending so much time making your videos really funny to watch❤ really  do love you Bobby ❤😭
3:37😍❤❤❤.
Good lord... I don't know how you managed to make it even more beautiful and impressive than part 1 but you did. The attention to detail is insane... and idk why I wasn't expecting the lighting but somehow I wasn't, and it was such a delightful surprise! This is incredible and fits absolutely perfectly with the art. Fantastic job, my dude!!!
👍💫✌️✨😎
Phenomenal job!!
The re-cap was amazing, getting to see all the best bits from the last video set the mood perfectly.
Nailed it!!
Oh poor Bobby , why fear bubbles when you get a pressure pot ?
Thank you for the video!!!
dude your videos are such a joy to watch.  You are absolutely amazing, and your artwork is unbelieveable.  Thank you for sharing your work.
After Jazza’s most recent exposé, I feel the need to say: **THIS** is how you do a collab! This is how you elevate others while also showcasing your own skills! This is it, my good sir Bobby of Dukey.  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️
absolutely stunning! i am drawing as a hobby,i am not good at it bc i lack patience... everytime i see a video of bobby i am mesmerized. how much effort. i am blown away. not only the art itself but the video aswell. at some point,i would just say "nah ... good enough" but seeing this... i should probably work on myself lol
What is the music used at 12:30?
Holy shiz... This is amazing
Bobby slowly be transforming into how to basic
Awesome 👏
Worth the wait as always
It's Finished......🤓
i love how just when you think hes gonna say an entire sentence in proper english he throws a curve ball at you. love it XD
I'm speechless....how does one say stunning without actually saying, 'stunning!'? I could list synonyms but that's not enough! Bl00dy brilliant will have to suffice 💕💕💕
This project is beyond epic and this was the icing on the cake! Hats off good sir! You killed it!
I don’t know what this channel is. I did not watch part one. I have not finished the video yet. Someone please tell me what happened in the first 30 seconds. Is this man ok? Dose he need help? Do I need help? What just happened? I feel scared, should I be scared?/hj  Edit: ok I finished the video and that was actually really cool the art is amazing /srs /gen/pos
Amazing, i love it. Bobby you are a legend, the amount of work that goes into your projects, the crafting, artwork. making, filming, stop motion, editing, audio, its really amazing work, you are an inspiration and a hero!
this man is a gift from whatever deity u believe in. uploading when i feel super down and brightening up my... night lol
HOLY SHIT was this worth the wait. Absolutely spectacular and a perfect compliment to the artwork as well. Incredible job man! We need more BDA!!!!
That stop motion clip is so kewl. Probably took a buttload of time to do. 🙌
Bobby Duke is the most awesome art creator! He is a total genius. So creative and makes videos that are fun to watch!
Bobby! this is amazing! i have tears in my eyes! i have been waiting for this !!!! <3
Love it Bobby!
Wow....very nice😎
Bobby you are amazing, this is amazing 🥺  You inspire me
The whole video was a work of art
wheres the painting going now?
It looks absolutely amazing!!! I love it!
WOOOW! That is absolutely THE perfect frame to showcase the painting while also adding to it. Kinda sad the journey is over, but the final piece turned out so incredible
I was expecting a Waler White to show up
The song for the reveal is: FLAW - AGST which fits so well with this absolute Masterpiece
Next year at the local fair:  Silicone wrapped crystals on a stick.
God, this is the most insane looking final product yet
Whoever edits these videos needs a raise
I need more Bobby Duke videos in my life.
"Is it as thick as that twerk was?"  Good one Nicole! 😂 Great job, Bobby, as always! Looks amazing and heavy.
The chaos in this intro rivals the strength of 1 Jazza video and that is saying a lot.
Love this channel so much!
Love the mlazri reference, had to do a double take
PART TWO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely amazing work Bobby! Great work
🤯🥳💥❣
Wow! That looks amazing
Hell of a belt sander ya got there Bobby!
Dude that’s amazing 🤩!!!!
You're doing great Bobby keep doing what you love!
I'm honestly in awe of how cool that looks!
I know that stop motion with the clay took FOREVERRRR
can this somehow be part of a traveling gallery? I see a lot of folks wanting it to be auctioned but that would leave all of us peons without the ability to see its majesty in person!
Looks awesome!
Bobby, love your vids, you're a true inspiration and awesome human!  Silicone doesn't cure if it's not exposed to air, if just a little so they didn't harden because you more or less made it air tight with the lids 🤗
ITS FINALLY HERE! I HAVE WAITED SO LONG!
This is insane
Why you so good at Art and funny
wow dude, that is truly a frame to bring the art to that next level
Soooooo good. I can see the frustration but it was very well worth it! Good job Mr. Duke!!
This is pure art Bobby ♡ thankyou for being you.
Send it to another DIY guy, and have him alter the frame
and that´s giving the world perfect a new meaning
On one hand I think it's safe to say Bobby probably needs some meds. But on another note... a more realistic note... Bobby is awesome the way he is. The crazy messed up super silly incredibly talented artist way he is.  In all seriousness,  Bobby, your silliness us only matched by your brilliant artistic talent. Don't ever change.
You outdid yourself with this one! Compliments the paintings perfectly!
You are hilarious!!!! I love your videos so much!!!!!!!
Super sick!!!   🤘🤘🤘🤘
Friggin stunning, amazingly cool
epic awesomeness!
the man is a true wizard <3 what a perfect finale to the project that took a butt ton of time to make ! i hope i can get a print, im sure their going to be amazing !!! the winner of this art piece will have something truly beautiful in their home !!
so a month is what he meant by not weary long ? hmm
so so so freakin sick
AT LONG LAST IT'S HERE
9:47 now we understand why you and your wife work so well 😂
I couldn't wait.  But I did.  Worth it.
Had to go back and pause to read his google search history,  worth it.
Wow Bobby lost a lot of weight
What a great end to this project. I think the frame turned out really sick!!
I bet half the time between this video and the last was making the stop motion…
The frame is the nicest part of the whole project. LOL By the way, what did you throw into pieces against the wall?
First time i see this channel and man you'r lovable.
It’s soooo prettyyy also I forgot the tape wasn’t real
Absolutely stunning Bobby ! Ten 100 knew you were the only one to finish this amazing piece. Love the video & your insanity its right on my wavelength. Amazing job dude! It's Freaking  Faultless
The 3D mind is strong with Bobby. Just fantastic work again.
This is absolutely lovely! Super gorgeous work, thank you for sharing with us
“I’m Bobby, could I BE wearing anymore shades?!” Me. In my head when he put all the shades on.   Frame is super sick. The detail is crazy
The most epic and perfect finishing touch. Wish I was rich enough to bid on the final product. It's going to be insane😮
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
I missed you! I hope youre well :) i love your knife making videos but this is just as great!
A. You make me so happy! B. That frame is the greatest thing my eyeballs have ever beholden!  Thank you for everything you do 😊
Bobby Duke farts smell like play-doh.
I was expecting this to be awesome and honestly…. This exceeded my expectations! The perfect frame for the art and a perfect frame just on its own! Don’t ever change Bobby!
Wow!
So beutifule❤❤❤❤❤❤
And dude you're b-roll is the greatest
9:03 My cat does the same thing right before he barfs.
That is INSANE. The amount of work. The range of colors & textures. And it LIGHTS UP.   Love it. 💕♥️💕
The work - amazing. The video - super enjoyable. the stop motion - much appreciated, the music jokes editing etc .... - thank you so much! Great job and great finish to an epic art journey.
The song is Flaw - AGST For anyone who wanted to know !
very cool
Bobby I just wanna say that no matter what, you always make me laugh in every video you make. Please tell Mrs. Duke and the kids I said hi!
6:45 mater this you?
Bobby your imagination, talent, artistry, humor and creativeness is out of this world. You make me smile, thank you.
Oh my gawd, its PERFECT. I can't imagine anything better to both add to the painting, and also complete it! I was skeptical when they originally said they were going to add a frame that nothing would possibly do this, but it is exceptional. Its been soooo cool to follow this project, and Bobby just made the whole thing more stunning 😍
When I saw his original sketch I though it would feel like too much but it turned out so incredible!! Your art is ic redouble and it turned out better than I could thought, perfect🤩🤩
“You won’t have to wait too long”
AMAZING!     I’ve been waiting for so long to see how this ended.  It was well worth it and all these artists (whom I follow) are extremely talented.    Well done @Bobbydukearts you did not disappoint!
This gave me chills! It looks absolutely amazing!!
Yooo I got that same Tool - Lateralus Vinyl! Glad to see you not only have good taste in art, but good taste in music as well. :D
Aw, so sad it's over, can all the artists start over from scratch and do another one? I fully enjoyed this journey. Bobbyduke was the icing on the cake at the end. Bravo, everyone!
I am always amazed by his art but this had me speachless. It is so beautyful amd it made my cry hahahah. You nailed this one
Dude you literally saved my f****** life and I will forever love you for that
Omg this is soooo good
this thing is beyond amazing. I don't even have words
Glad to see a community come together like this and create a masterpiece that will out live us all. Inspirational 🙌
6:46 👍
Dude. I'm not sure the best way to frame this, but you rock. ...or rather, crystal.
I didn't realize when he said he wanted it exactly like his drawing, he meant EXACTLY like his drawing 😂
You go GIRL!!!
I just wanted to say thank you so much. For your hard work, time, and just to videos in general.  I quit art a year ago and refused to get back into it and I let my talent waste away, but you inspire me so much I got back into it. So just thank you so much Bobby, like really ❣️❣️❣️❣️  And you're so talented it hurts XD
Absolutely stunning 💗
Absolutely amazing frame Bobby   Well worth waiting to see the end result 👍  Keep on bring your awesome videos  they really brighten so many peoples day  ❤ 💕
The music near the end of this video sounded familiar and reminded me of another piece, so after watching this I went searching and found what it was that it reminded me of - The Brazilian by Genesis.  Brilliant track.     P.s. brilliant artwork as always Bobby Duke (pps, as a brit, it’s funny hearing you say ‘bloke of wewd’ because of course ‘bloke’ is british slang for a dude)
Please team up with Rachel Maksy.
This is so worth the wait and a beautiful finale to this awesome project!
"I've been procrastinating because I didn't know how to start doing the thing" "It's now the next day because I've been procrastinating" "Now it's night because I've been procrastinating again" "And now it's the next day"  Yup. That's my creative process as well.
Amazing! 💖
The only thing that could make this frame better, would be if it had our wedding photo in it Bobby you big sexy man. Great work ⚒
I love you Bobby and all the art you create it’s inspirational. And I guess all the thingy-ma-doo’s are cool too.
Jeez I love that guy
i just took a hot steemy Duke in my pants when i saw this in my notifications!!!
8:53🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is the coolest frame!
:)
I am DISGUSTED by how freaking talented this guy is. I hate you so much, Bobert.
Compressed air helps poop out stuck crystals. Good to know.
So, so, so amazing!  Those crystals!!! 💜💜
I watch  TONS of you tube videos. And I have a few favorite people. But you are by FAR the best!!!!! Thousand times better than the best one!
this is SO COOL!!!! blessed be thou who gets this f*cking thing!!! <3
Great turnout, but holy crap my trypophobia was being triggered so hard by some of the molds.
You always do so much for the art and your videos and I genuinely appreciate it. It does not go unnoticed.
are you the real meme?!
Really enjoyed this Bobby! Fantastic job! Still holding out for the twerking "how to" video.
The personal collection bit got me lmao
It's beautiful. Even my cockatiel liked it. She kept trying to eat it through the screen.
BRAVO!!! What an outstanding finish to this project!!! That looked like an impressive amount of artistic struggle. And not only did you flip graciously through the air like an twisting gymnast, you wonderfully landed on you feetsies. Good job! Standing Ovation!
This is stunning. I need a reaction  video from all of the contributing artists!!!!!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
FINALLY
It is beautiful. ❤️ I kind of want to see the reaction video....
He tweeks better than me
Hey i have that Tool colored vinyl :P
Mind blown!!! Truly incredible Bobby
good job
Every time I watch super creative content like this, I wish I could do something as cool. But the only thing I'm a pro at is crastinating and I have the attention span of a fruit fly. To the point where I often struggle to get through videos longer than 2 minutes without moving on to something else. (Not with Bobby's tho, cause they're frickin a-MA-zing!)
Bobby your creative mind is just a pure joy to get to experience even an iota of! Thank you for making such an impactful finale to this amazing series. The art community of YouTube is truly such an inspiration, thank you thank you thank you! 🪵
That is awesome and how is your Argus monitor lizard
Beautiful!!! I came into this from Jazza's video. So I had to watch from the beginning. And now I just watch a lot of art videos...
No wonder this took so long
Dewd...you have outdone yourself yet again! This is easily the best art collaboration on YouTube. I have watched every artist contribute and...Bobby? You put the artistic epoxy finish on this MASTERPIECE!
09:00 my cat at 3am trying to throw up
You sooooo got that in your mouth! That's why you cut that part short at the end! O and I love your videos!
''Video to part 2 in description''  Me double checking what video I am watching
Hi
You have outdone yourself Sir Dukes-a-lot! 👏👏👏
That looks amazing!
@6:08 uhuh, cool art bud, but please stop drilling towards your hands O_O
😎😎😎😎💖💖💖💖😍😍🤓🤗😂😉 COOL!!!! AS ALL WAYS !!!!!
BOBBBBBYYYYYY!!!! OMG! AMAZING! As a creator myself...I MUST tell you that its okay to take time on a piece...be it the piece itself or the editing of the video...we are human ... ive had paintings take me months, weeks, one has been in the works for two years. I am in AWE of the final product here dude... just better than expected. not that i had doubts. been a viewer for years, cant wait to see what you come up with next!! BRING ON THE WEWD!
That’s insane. I love it. ❤️
It’s beautiful.  Your perfectionist ways are worth the wait.
You are so fucking crazy
Bobby needs to do a master class. What a freakin badass frame. I wish I knew more about stuff to make stuff from stuff to make it look like cool stuff! 👏👏👏
I sincerely think you're a genius. The time and effort you put into your projects is exceptional. Your creations are unique and beautiful. You do all this while presenting it in a very enjoyable and humorous manner. Thank you.
This was gorgeous!!!!!
Man I love you XD
3 words describe this A-MAY-ZING
Omg I checked if you updated the second part  And there were no update And then this video showed up in my recommendation page
n'eokay bye
14:48 I love you too man
As if it couldn't get any better on its own, here comes Bobby farting all over it and making it a masterpiece!
So cool <3
Wow man!!! A-MA-ZING!!!! Worth the wait. And I just LOVE your sense of humour.
Wow the frame is the best part it's gorgeous.
WOWOWOWOWOWOWO AMAZING
On the merch: Is that Plank Plank...........You live? Plank LIVES!!!!
OMG....that was sum funny watchin.....my back button is broke! That turned out amazing!
2:51🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok but what are they going to do with it now? Would it go to a museum or back to the person that started it or is it just going to stay with Bobby
You're amazing. Your art is amazing. Your videos are amazing. Keep it up 🤙
Hello, I have to say that I love your videous, your mastrpieces and your humor. Now that I do my own art and put hours into it. I can see how fulfilling the work can be. Please continue recording. Byeee *farts quietly and leaves*
The smiling plank of wewd on your t-shirt reminds me of Little Wooden Boy
Wouw…
The frame blended with the painting so well!! Absolutely gorgeous work, Bobby!😍
Dude!!! 🤣 you’re tooo funny 😂
This is beautiful!
I love the almost Ditko's dots appearance of the lower wewden part.
BOBBY! How is anything man-made thus beautiful!! It looks amazing🤩 And those are probably the prettiest epoxy crystals I've ever seen🙌🏻
6:46 Naughty.... I love your humor.
Awesome!!!
Dude... Amazing!
6:45 was hilarious
Such a majestic piece. Thank you  to all the Artists for that inspirational collaboration.
You nailed it man!!!
This guy has got to be one of my favorites if not favorite content creator out there
We have prayed for an OCD clown to bring us light and laughter, and yea tho we walk thru the valley of the shadow of debt, we shall fear no weasel WITH BOBBY DUKE AROUND TO SLAP A SMILE ON OUR FACE BITS! 💖
Big ❤️to your wife. I would love to hang out with her!👏🏻👏🏻 and the frames awesome too😉
Good. LORD!  This is STUNNING!! 100% the best part of the whole piece.
Absolutely AH-MAZING!!! You absolutely killed it, Bobby! The painting was spectacular before now, all together in its frame... 🔥
That's... pretty dope. Congratulations to all involved.
That dumpy though 👁👄👁
I saw Lateralis proudly displayed on your Book shelf. Does that mean you are a massive fan of Tewl?
Absolutely f***ing genius! So much of the paintings mirrored in the frame with nice aestethics and then your spin on it all - bordering on kitsch but in a cool way which actually fit.... What a feat! Truly a worlds biggest art collab worthy of that frame! 🙏🙏🙏
I love it but Bobby! Where's your mask when handling the sillycone and raisin?! That stuff will scar your lungs!
Absolutely amazing!  It just brings everything together perfectly! 😍😍😍
Yeah, the continuation to this art piece!
the best nft ever
Freaking awesome. Sooooo much work has gone into this piece of art, it truly is amazing. Thank you to Ten Hundred for initiating the concept and for all the other artists who have contributed to it - you rock!
I don’t think many people will know the reference at 6:45, but I do and it’s great!
Which took longer? Stop motion shooting or the pulling the green screen down editing?
You don't gotta throw the fake fart sound in, Bobby. We all know your farts don't make a noise anymore
You spent more time on that stop motion bit than any other part of the project and filming for parts 1 and 2, didn't you?
So phenomenal! It’s stunning and you really put the most beautiful touches into it!
Nice job BOBBY DUKE! I personally think I need to see more videos per month. 🤔
OMGosh!!! That is perfect Bobby! I loved watching each installment from all the artists and I'm so glad they asked you to finish it.  Happy Ending.
Respect
I wawnt thayut
Yeah Bobby,  that's the icing on the cake.  Everyone did an amazing job
Thank you Bobby, for always putting a smile on my face. Your art videos always get me out of my funk. I hope you continue to have fun, and that life treats you well. Im always checking your channel just incase I miss the notification. Best of wishes to you and your family! Also, this frame is God dang beautiful! O.o *cant stop staring*
I love his voice, and his art
Bobby I hope those pedestal crystals feel more superior constantly throughout their lives
“Let me light up the run way with something from my personal collection” if you know you know
Soooo worth the wait! What an incredible finish to an incredible collaboration 👏🏻
This is utterly amazing. Fantastic work! ♥ I looove how much effort you put into each part of the frame.
Holy smokes. This frame is absolutely mind blowing.  😱💜💜💜💜💜👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Wow...  magnificent it is.. Indeed
This is fantastic
It's beautiful. I love the holo
WOW just.. WOW
Just wow!  I had to pause the video and admire the finished frame for a couple of minutes. We can buy a print, but we won't ever get such a fantastic frame for it.
Bobby, that is absolutely incredible! It damned near made me cry
Stunning! Marvelous! I thought I was a perfectionist, but Bobby really takes the cake with attention to detail. The arts student in my feels very happy rn ❤
Amazing, jaw-dropping. I love it
So good
The masterwork is finally complete. Wewd you believe it?
It's priceless
Your creativity is just BEYOND!!!  The time involved in making the frame ALONE is INSANE not even considering making this video!!  It’s like eating a whole pie and then digging into a giant cake. I’m in awe!!!  You bring it every video and I don’t know how you do it!!!  Love it!!!  You’re AWESOME!!
Bobby is a normal person a good person a very very good person but...    Artists are normal in their own way. ❤
I had a smile on my face during the whole video 😄 awesome outcome! Love you too 🤙🏼
Beautiful
This is absolutely awesome!!!
Bravoooo 👏👏👏👏👏👏
This came out so unbelievably good. The fact that you made the crystal shapes from SCRATCH to get your perfect vision is incredible. I know perfectionism really sucks to experience but gosh it was really worth it for what a beauty this frame is
Pure electric goosebumps when that beat hit at the end with the big reveal! What an epic frame and what a crazy journey this has been! Can’t wait to see it in person 🙌🙌🙌
you knock this out the park bobby
that's visually stunning the frames not half bad either ,no really the  frame is  stunning
so good! Duke worthy!
This has to be the best thing Bobby has ever built
My favorite YouTuber in 2022
7:48 I also need to know how to stop eating batteries as well, anyone have ideas?
Love the humor and the silly voice :>
God! I love your work!
The wait was worth it! Me the whole video: oh my god! wow! what? no way! really? Wow! The art, the creativity, the editing! and the fun. No wonder why second part took so long. I’ll watch it again and again. Thanks, Bobby and Nicole! This really is, as Ten Hun said, the cherry of the cake. Congrats to all the artist
Totally Awesome Dude🤘
So beautiful 😭😭
Bobby, I would love to buy one of your t-shirts, but man... unfortunately 30 dollars in my country (Brazil) is more money than I could pay. But I hope you guys can sell a lot! See ya in your next video and I hope you and your family be safe  Amazing work btw lol
This guy is a comedy genius
I am a mere rando of the net that is inter and I love and appreciate the joy and hilarity you bring to your videos. However, for me personally, the mesmerising part is the passion, perfection and dedication you put into every project, something I could watch for hours. Once in a while, God puts a beacon of light on the outside of a person for the whole world to see and the day when your light finally goes out (many, many years from now), the world will be a much darker place for it. Thank you, to you and your family, for the time and energy you put into your work and for gifting it to us so that we can share in your joy <3
Dope
Bobby it’s 2022 why did you write 2021 on the back
it's been A MONTH.
Yay! Another video from Bobby Dukestrial Light 'n Magic! I'm sure man and Gelfling alike will appreciate the masterful craftsmanship put into making shiny creestals that may spell certain doom for some worlds, yet provide others with something neat to look at and say, "Yah. That's pretty all right." Fantastic work. You are indeed a wizard of wewd and cutty things. Ow.
Came for the art. Stayed for the twerking.
Damn! That opening sequence was insane dude 😲 Fantastic editing BTW. Glad I read the description, was about to blow up the comments to know who the hell made the art work as looked amazing. Then I see 10Hun on there and I'm not surprised one bit 😂 then I remember the huge collab due to following nearly all the creators. This is a crazy project my man 👌🏼
It isn‘t only frame for a painting. It‘s a part of the art. Just stunning how everything came out
You should take the design on that shirt and NFT it. I mean NFT is stupid and predatory pretty much, but your design there is exactly the kind of original excellent art that should be used on NFT.
The One and Only Bobby Duke! I love your videos and the artwork is friggin awesome! I love your whole family-just an awesome bunch! Love the Frame!!🔥💙😘😍
Bobby Duke has a habit of making the most enjoyable content on the youtube platform, and then just uploading it like its no big deal.
Bobby at end of part one: “ I promise you won’t have to wait very long” December 31 - January 31 …..💀 Jk, I only had to wait 2 seconds because the algorithm sucks and I didn’t see part one until right now.
Those plates on the wall are awesome! Is that green one so close to the other one at purpose? Kinda driving me slowly insane :P
Was well worth the wait. Love you Bobby.  Hilarious wewd man...
Been waiting for this video for EVER!
Hi
finally it's done it took you so long 😊
Stunning and worth the wait
Bobby... after making this, how are you supposed to get better? You can't get better than perfection.
The addition of the inverted lighting you placed into the frame is so dope! All the detail is killer and really blends perfectly with the entire vibe of the painting. Maximalism to the... MAX. More is more baby!
Is have been waiting...SO LONG...and I am in LOOOOVEEEE
I was NOT ready for that reference at 6:51 oh lord-
In fairness you are a genius
It used to be great to watch this channel but not now. It has gone downhill a lot because of the stupidity.
It's perfect 😌
Finally!!!!!
Let me hit that sage
Patience is a virtue! Next time do not complain about him taking too long. Its not long ago that part 1 was uploaded.
Casualy nailing a damn hard stopmotion... Cause why not
Laughed and laughed and then got all emotional at the end there.  What a beautiful result!
is there any opportunity, to donate money once, instead of patreon ?
heeheehee all the molds look like pink hairless Ball Sacks XD
Wow! That frame is absolutely perfect!  And that whole procrastination bit… I think I related so hard I pulled a muscle!
7:48 How to stop eating batteries Can you milk a turtle What to do if you poop your pants  That was very sneaky Mr. Bobby 😂
Awesome. Really great to see you back. Hope you're doing well.
Wow
The frame is Stunning. O_O amazing fit to that piece of art and makes your own statement. What a great idea and execution.
This collaboration was awesome, it introduced me to so many good creators, including you <3
That's a stunning piece of artwork to crown the painting. Top notch as usual. 🥰❤‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
please, give this man a prize!!! The determination, ohh is superb🙏 💯
Absofreakinlutely Fabulous & Magical-- Just like YOU!
Wtf
I've been waiting for this video, thinking "Geez, Bobby, what's taking so long?!" But now I get it. Now I know. You just can't rush perfection, can you?😌
I was so happy when I got this notification and it made my day Thank you
Man Bobby, this turned out amazing! And the way you make videos always has me in stitches. That bit about procrastinating I felt in my heart. I do that all the time. I do it until the last possible moment and then I almost have a nervous breakdown because I'm so stressed. I never learn from it and usually joke about it when I'm not in the middle of it because crying isn't gonna make it any better. It's good to see someone so talented and *seen* just openly say "I procrastinated". Makes me feel so much better about my own issues: If you can succeed despite the habbit of procrastinating, why can't I?  Thanks for all you do Bobby. Truly. Your content always makes me really happy.
that is surreal
Hot DAMN it turned out well. Thanks for the magnificence
Love
It looked cool even without the 3D crystals and the leds, but with them it is truly the very next level! Congrats man, a mighty contribution to a mighty collab!
I want thahtttttt
this is literally, the coolest thing i've ever seen.
Less than two minutes in, and I think Bobby's got a lot of pent up frustration to vent with how frequently he's yeeting breakable objects at the wall.
But wait...you skip the other part twos and now this is a two. You've changed Bobby. I'm only joking   you and Nicole are hilarious. You made such an amazing video. I just sent it to my sibling because we've been looking forward to this vodeo coming out. I really love how much the fram adds to the pice its self
Pretty cool result :D
Anyone know the name of the song that plays at 11:07?
Can I come to your shed and angrily throw things at the wall? I've got quite a lot of rage inside this tiny body and I can tell when you throw something it feels gooooodddd 😭✋
I said "Ryan" out loud in time with you at 0:07 in case you worried no one would enjoy that at least one person did.
Why not make epoxy cubes instead of clay cubes and then cutting instead of making molds?
Where is the (wewd) gang
Finally!
Bobby: it shouldn’t take very long Also bobby: takes 2 days to finish a freaking Mona lisa
yay!!!! i have been so excited to watch this, looked for it everyday since part one, and you never disappoint, your videos and art are always worth the wait. ^_^ me and my daughter love watching them.
Sand works well to hold your molds that don't have flat bottoms. ❤️ You Bobby!
silly cone
Dear Mr. Duke Arts,             You've outdone yourself...       Well, at the very least you've  done yourself....ew gross
yyyaaaAAAAAAAAaaaayyy
What an amazing looking frame, Your a legend Bobby!!
I think you are completely crazy with lots of humor and I love it!!! You are an artist and I love all your creations!!! Great job!
I've always loved your art; it really is amazing and magical, and I love to watch the process, with your signature character!
Holy moly…… 😱🤩👊🏽👏👌🏽 can not believe how stunning!
Good GOD!!!!! That is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!
Breathta.kingly stunning artist  Bobby you are f'ing amazing and made each  artist  shiine
I'm high af watching a Bobby Duke video while eating a cookie cake thingy and how that frame came out just improved that sh*t 100%. That is some b-e-a-u-tiful sh*t.
Awesome finish to a really cool and inspiring project!
idk why but you sanding those crystal shapes is the most satisfying thing ever
Crooks and nanny’s is my favorite
I do wonder if you can milk a turtle now
Thank you - we were all excited and anxious waiting for it. It's awesome.
hi i'm indonesian
nice stop motion  the art is so dope  and the frame is out of this world
Lmaooo, I saw this notification and immediately said BOBBEH!!
Me: "This video took a month since the last one goddamnit I wanna see the frame what took so long" Bobby: has a stopmotion scene of the crystals moving around in a line, coiling around themselves, lining up and then gliding off screen Me: "ohh ok yeah that makes sense"
Hi
That shirt’s original design is how I first found Peter and it was the best suggestion from YouTube since that time you made Cody’s Lab his thing.
Best thing I could come home from school to.
Amazing! That will sell for millions <1 <3
"Is that stupid?"  Yes, Bobby, it is. And we love it, ya goobus. Never change.
Bobby, I'm 35 now, but can I be you when I grow up?
Yooo it looks to cool
I love this video so much❤😂
wow, that's an incredible frame!!  you're so frickin talented, sir.
Amazing! You crushed it
This looks absolutely amazing!
6:29, "The cone that is silly" Gosh I love you Bobby
I have been waiting for THIS!!!
I've been following for so long and I just love this channel so much
So what happens to the piece now?
My God that thing is Hella Awesome y'all!!!!!!!!!!!  Damn fine job everyone involved!!!
NERD FORGE!
You motivate me and cheer me up more than you can imagine bobby! Love what you done with the crystals man! :)
That stop-motion of the crystals probably took so long but imo it was worth it
Your intro sounded like a Tomodachi Life miim. 👥🌁  Take care Bobby, I love your frame, altogether an amazing ethereal piece. 🌌   🪵
You are absolutely incredible. Most breath taking frame the world's ever seen and the art inside it is pretty amazing as well.  Kudos
couldve grown ur own crystals ofcourse :) good to see u back at it. keep going! very nice craftsmanship and funny as ever ofcourse!
Best thing about your moulds for crystals? You now have a bunch of unique crystal moulds that no one else has and you can probably reuse for cool projects like I dunno, a crystal lamp?
This is so amazing Bobby! You are a true inspiration to us all.
4:50 „And now it‘s night, because i procrastinated“ Know that feeling, bro. 😂
What's the song 13:36
My brain went "n-gons!" And realized I've been working for 15 hours lel
That frame is so F-ing cool. Totally worth the wait!
Clayton bigsby lol
Suppper coool Bobby!!! The ammount of time and thought put into every second of your video is so amazing!!
Your creativity/imagination is absolutely amazing!!!  I always watch in awe ♥️♥️♥️
Bobby, you're not disgusting for wearing the same shirt for 2 days. It's not disgusting at all. I regularly wear the same shirt 3 days in a row. Please, someone tell me why it's disgusting.
Last haha i win im last
Yeeees
YAAAYY.
These crystals remind me of the skylander figures!
you make us wait too long, but such a great video again!
Am i weird for liking the frame the most?
6:45 I was not prepared for this, and I love the Princess Bride reference, this whole video is great
No wonder part 2 took so long to come out, dude made a fricking perfect  stop motion in the middle of it... well done we love it!
Its so amazing when the art community makes something together! Love this! ❤️
whwn i get rich, i hire u for some artworks, because u deserve a lot money for ur individual Masterpieces
Anyone know the song at the end?
i wawnt that
Your editing is INSANE. I replayed the crystal stopmotion like ten times!!! And— literally blew my mind when you pulled a green screen (?) and transitioned to a cleaned workbench.
FINALLY¡!!!!!!!!!
dude that stop motion 3:42  must took forever.
Yes! I’ve been waiting for this! 😍👍
Spectacular! You have always impressed, and this was no exception. Well done! Thanks for sharing.
wo
ROBERT DUKE!! It is AMAZING!!! I mean, expected nothing less from you.. but it’s EXQUISITE!!!
His attention to detail is amazing. 🖤🖤🖤
Every time Bobby makes a post, I get a huge smile knowing I’m going to have a good laugh!😁🤣😂
Awesome.
I am so amazed! The amount of work you put not only into the frame but also the video is incredible. The transition between the wood and the crystals is so beautiful, and the light you added at the end makes it even look more beautiful. This is just amazing man! You are amazing!
Ahhhhhhh it's heeeeeere 😁
And now it's night because I procrastinated.... And now it's the next day 😂. freaking relatable!!
this is fucking awesome Bobby!
Now make a wewd nft
Bravo, just like always, you managed to amaze us yet again Hats off to ya Dukey
AMAZING 🥰 AMAZING 🥰 AMAZING 😳🥺😭 BEAUTIFUL 😲😃 PERFECTION 🥰 😳shiny😳  😙🤌
Absolutely epic piece!
Yaaaaaayyyy i’m so happy you finally made a part 2 I’ve been waiting for so long thank you 😁😁
Amazing.........i......I..........I WANT THAT! <3
That is soooooo gorgeous! A masterpiece in every sense!
NICE WORK!! 😍
Dude I literally got chills when you revealed the result! You are so dang CRAZY at what you do it's amazing!
Give this man an Oscar
Bobby has a talent for creating satisfying moments even more satisfying than the scene in Toy Story 2.
the amount of work thats in that B-roll alone is already respectable xD  but the entire artwork is sublime like always ^^
3D printing was make this project mach more easy.
Took him a bit but u can't rush true art
That's awesome..so amazing when people work together to create joy
How have you been with smoking? Still clean?
I'm so glad to be watching this video but Bobby, er Mr. Duke, could you please be a little less smash smashy out of nowhere? Scared me and my cat and now I have a cut down the length of my thigh
That frame alone is absolutely gorgeous, and the finished product is phenomenally pretty! This is such a cool project and I'm glad to see it finally finished :)
It's 1 am... I am here
Holy shit that's so good ur a master of ur arts Bobby
Pointy crystals
We should clone Bobby to get a new Bobby making more Bobby videos... Was already wondering why it takes such a long time. Stopped wondering after seeing him crossing off eeeevery crystal seperately xD
Congrats on finally finishing such a beautiful piece, you’re amazing Bobby. As well as the other artists involved in this project!
Absolutely amazing!! Your work never ceases to amaze me. I've been watching the journey of this piece from the very start. It's amazing to see it finished! Everyone did an amazing job!
You never cease to amaze me, Bobbily Dukeily!
Woooooow it’s beautiful!
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS IT IS AMAZING LOVED IT
It's perfect!
You never cease to amaze and inspire me, bobby. It's beautiful, and it compliments the piece perfectly.
waw 0 dislikes
bangin. always happy to something by bobby duke.
It's perfect. Worth the wait, for sure. Thank you taking us along with you on the journey!
It's incredible, Bobby! Inspiring! And it shows how hard work yields beautiful results - I love it
This is absolutely killer! Wow. It's literally perfect for the painting.
A
🤩😍
I love the fact Jazza was worried to touch and mask off the other artists work but Bobby just throws the thing on a table router to add LED stripe.. amazing
Wait...Someone's into Retrowave like myself?! o.O  Is Bobbieh Duke muh spirit animal?...And why do I have this sudden urge to shatter things via throwing them into walls?..
sweet.
i absolutely love your work  wow
INSANE :O
Incredibbble 🤩 worth the wait
I love how in the first video you said you don't want the frame to over power or distract from the artwork.... You one up'd them good Bobby Duke.
Incredible very good better than the actual art.
There’s no way my man put in the “light up the runway with something from my personal collection” joke 💀💀💀
Omg I love it
Until we meet again Bobby. What a damm good job you did man. Thank you
Fantastic work, Bobby!! Wowwowow👏👏🎉
The crystals you made are fantastic, unfortunately the picture is crap. I expected better from so many creators collaborating.
The first thirty seconds needs to be snipped and used forever as a visual recap of 2021. A+ work, as always!
Even more amazing than I could have imagined. Kudos to all artists involved. Just beautiful!
bobby... just... how much more amazing can your art be? i'm speechles, i know how beatiful your art is... but it ALWAYS surprise me the finish result.
is there any chance you sell some of these crystal molds?
Siiiiick!
That's friggin' awesome!!! Good luck shipping that without the crystals breaking, be a total shame.
Famous quote from Bobby "that's because I'm lazy and discusting."
Laughed my ass off! Thanks Bobby
woah it came out beautiful, worth the wait for part 2
I have to stop to say WOW! I'll keep on woaching!
OMG Bobby its amazing!
the stop motion was so smooth a cool lmao
'His Lead Production Time from Even Back-In-The-Day', you are Genius-Like.
YASSSSS SO READY
Ermeegewd!!! It's perfect!! Sooooo worth waiting for!! 😱😍
Great twerk form bro.
I think I can speak for many when I say Bobby is hands down my artsy hero, who may or may not wear capes... I mean, those edit sequences alone are artistry!!!
That is the prettiest frame I have ever seen. Its so stunning, im  afraid I'd only look at it and not the art lol
Make Halo sculpture
Absolutely stunning! It couldn't be any more perfect! Like everything you make!
I keep thinking you can't impress me anymore than u already have.....and then you do! : )
That whole thing is dope
Bobby, you out did yourself. Absolutely stunning!
Hardly twerking LMFAO
It’s 6 am and I am glad I’m awake to watch this Truly amazing art process. Great work!!!
Id rather it take a while and be a perfected piece from the Duke. The anticipation is all part of the art scheme you dingus
Happy new year to you and your familly, Bobby. Thank you!
Bobby you are so talented and its just great to see you make things. Awesome work!
Been waiting for so long!  Instaclicked this one. Looks stunning!
Ive been waiting for this video, its already a masterpiece but now we get to finish and its truly amazing, might be your best piece that you've done so far, im in awe over this
Apparently I got here in 47 seconds and there are 44 comments. No views though.
Worth the wait! Keep up the great work!!
It’s been a month
WOW 😲💖
Super smooth stop motion you got there Bobby. Well done
Fuck yes, Bobby Duke u smashed it pal, took this to a whole new epic wwddddd level
So Cool 😍
To the great Bobby Duke and his magnificent WOUD. my 8 yr old daughter Isabella is so inspired by you and your beautiful works of art. She is an inspiring artist who started at the age of 2. Thank you for what you do and how you inspire others including my daughter. 💕😊❤️ A fan and her inspired daughter!!!
❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️😱❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh wow!!!! That is incredible!!!!!!
YESSSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THREE WEEKS AND MY DREAM HAS COME TRUEEE!!!!!
I know this might be biased, but I really love your part in the project. You did an outstanding job, Bobby
Ps your TWERK IS SUBLIME 🤪
Yasss princess bride is one the the best movies evveerrr
Very nice Bobby
Which crystal is your favorite
Imagine at the end it just didn't fit 😂 Love it and all your other work Bobby
Your skill is so impressive! Truly inspiring! :o
I think Bobby put in more hours than all the others combined 🤔
Amazing
Incredibly ridiculously gaw-juss
Calling Doke a toy is like calling Ferraris grocery-getters
Wholly crap that frame is INSANE
15 min gang
Sir Teren, you both lose and win at 'Butt-Load of Crystals'.
The final frame and picture was amazing and gave me feels. Amazing work!
Anyone happen to know the music he used at the end ? 👀
Please... Pretty please don't broke this one
That stop motion animation must have taken awhile, it was so smooth looking
Only thing I would’ve added is a bit of iridescent mica powder into the crystal epoxy. Just a hint. Different colors. A few with color shift pink/gold, blue/purple, green/blue… just so there’s the slightest haze of extra extra mess haha. But why mess with perfection?!
Been waiting for this in excitement since part 1,  and my God you never disappoint.  Pure class, standing ovation sir 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❣
This is incredible Bobby! 👏👏👏👏👏
this video made me laugh so hard i cried, and cry so hard i laughed.
@ 3:36 My little pretties.
Amazing!. Thanks
I WANT THAT!!!
"The cone that is silly" hahaha, I can only imagine how much fun it would be to hang out with this guy haha
all i can say is that one beautiful peace of work
Nice
Spectacular
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Okay make it a NFT!
Omg you did that painting JUSTICE! THATS BEAUTIFUL! BOBBY you have yet again done somthing amazing with Wewd
That is unbelievably beautiful.. liked the little omage to Doke. That guy is so talented.
I know the feeling dude
I feel you... procrastinating on a project where you need to wait a day after every step ..... so exhausting
I love YouTube magic! Lol
It is freaking stunning, love it and the journey😭❤
Okay that’s sick 👏
Sheeeesh
"I mounted the crystals on little pedestals, not only so they can feel superior" lmfao. I shot snot out my nose. You're one random, hilarious guy. I freakin love this guy.
You pretty much did more work than the artists combined, the frame is the masterpiece
Absolutely a creative and amazing piece of work
I missed your videos so much!!! They're so amazing and entertaining 👏🏻👏🏻❤️❤️
ALWAYS worth the wait, you hilarious, hilarious, charismatic human.  i want thayat.
Just one word... *"Masterpiece"*
Incredible
OMG I’ve never been more excited in my entire life!!!
you say often that you will make video more often, but I don't care waiting 1,2,or 3 weeks if it's for videos of that quality, you truly are the best  and yes cones are silly
Looks so good. But what is this full art worth. And should it belong in a museum for all to watch.
I love this
I’ve been hooked since he got the block of layered paint
This entire project was so fun to watch.
How long did it take Bobby to stop motion animate all those crystals moving ?!  A lot of work for a very short segment !
Only a few minutes in, but the energy of these videos always makes me feel so much better, genuinely
Send it to ZHC
I've been checking your channel daily for the last month 😭 you promised it wouldn't take long😂❤️
Holy cow this is too gorgeous for words, well done man 🥰😍
Wow that looks very beautiful
@DerekFromMalden !!! 👍🏻 Representing Bobby Duke! I love you videos and art, and your wife's humor!
Never disappoints..
I love you to
2:22 ngl I thought he'd make it into a song but ig we can't have everything :((  3:36 But he made up for it when he did this awesome stop motion crystal view!! :))
Amazing!
Words cannot describe the anticipation I've felt for the last month
I've been waiting for a new Post and it's here
Oh my o o my oh my o o my
Why doesn't this have a billion views already?! ..gAahhhhHHH!!
Hallo from Denmark and i love your video 😍❤❤❤👍
I'm scared that one day Bobby has to shave his beard, totally... his beard is perfect 😩
imperial measurements will never make sense to me a new zealander, i can’t believe americans haven’t switch to metric and still use fractions to measure things
Oh my oh oh my oh my oh oh my oh my oh oh my
gregory.
You are my inspiration. I hope to one day be as amazing of an artist as you!
oh damn
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Sick stopmotion though?
the stop-motion with the apoxy crystals? are you kidding me?? :o that's so much work just for that little section alone wow
Nothings thicker than that twerk
Finally
oh yeah
So dope
The stop motion looked so good, Bobby!

Finaly! I've been waiting so long for this! I love your art Bobby!💙
The Hog Rider card is opened from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is an exceptionally quick structure focusing on, scuffle troop with decently high hitpoints and harm. He shows up very much like his Clash of Clans partner; a man with earthy colored eyebrows, a facial hair growth, a mohawk, and a brilliant body penetrating in his left ear who is riding a hoard. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to send. Procedure His quick move speed can help forward smaller than expected tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. Simultaneously, he can likewise work as a tank for lower hitpoint troops, for example, Goblins as he actually has a considerable lot of wellbeing. Most modest multitudes supplement the Hog Rider well, as they are close to as quick as him and typically power more than one card out of the adversary's hand. The Hog Rider battles with swarms, as they can harm him down and overcome him rapidly while impeding his way. Savages specifically can completely counter him without extremely severe planning on the safeguard's part, however be careful about spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits whenever put right on top of it. Nonetheless, on the off chance that you place something before the Hog Rider, the Hunter's sprinkle will harm the Hog Rider and hit the card before it more. The Hog Rider related to the Freeze can amaze the rival and permit the Hog Rider to bargain considerably more harm than expected, particularly assuming that the rival's go-to counter is a multitude, or multitudes are their main viable counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will quickly be crushed by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low sufficient wellbeing to be crushed by a subsequent Zap or Giant Snowball. Nonetheless, this technique isn't exceptionally compelling against structures as the Hog Rider will require a significant stretch of time to obliterate the structure, giving the rival sufficient chance to express another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can bargain a great deal of harm during the freeze time, however this can permit the adversary to set up a huge counterpush. Consequently, players ought to either possibly go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have different units upholding it from a counterattack, or then again in the event that the match is going to end and they need to bargain however much harm as could reasonably be expected. It's anything but smart to send in a Hog Rider just to annihilate a structure, particularly in the event that it is the main structure focusing on unit accessible, as overcoming Crown Towers turns out to be significantly more troublesome. Spells or basically holding up out the lifetime of the structure are more powerful. The exemption for this is an Elixir Collector put before the King's Tower. On the off chance that a Hog Rider put at the scaffold, he can annihilate the Collector for a positive Elixir exchange, however the harm from both Princess Towers will normally mean he doesn't make due to bargain any harm to them. In any case, assuming that the rival sends in shielding troops, it very well may be a chance to acquire spell harm esteem. In a deck with a few minimal expense cards, everything will work out for the best to just send the Hog Rider against one structure. These decks mix their card turn adequately speedy, that they will show up to their next Hog Rider before the following structure shows up in the adversary's card revolution. Since quite a while ago ran troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can kill those structures, protecting a portion of the Hog Rider's wellbeing, conceivably permitting it to get some Tower harm. Whenever there are structures put in the center to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the arrangement of the Hog Rider and the sort of building set can help the Hog Rider to sidestep specific structures. Detached structures, for example, spawners and Elixir Collector have a bigger hitbox than cautious structures; and that actually intends that assuming an inactive structure was set 3 tiles from the waterway in the adversary's side, then, at that point, it is outside the realm of possibilities for the Hog Rider to sidestep that position as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that structure. Cautious structures have a more modest hitbox than an inactive structure, and that implies if that assuming a protective structure was put three tiles from the waterway in the rival's side, a Hog Rider put at the exceptionally left or right half of the Arena might have the option to sidestep it because of its more modest hitbox. Assuming the player has a structure previously positioned down in the focal point of the field, and the rival attempts to sidestep it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the field, they can utilize specific air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the structure as it gets around the stream, adequately denying the detour endeavor. They should be now drifting over the right arrangement, as extremely fast reflexes are needed to accurately play out this procedure. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be set directly before the Hog Rider when it is sent. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stun the above arrangement one tile to the right in the event that the Hog Rider is put on the left half of the field, as well as the other way around. They can likewise utilize ground troops to accomplish a similar outcome.
