I think I’d go for Cantona .. mainly based on consistency
2:40 Gary Neville to be fair at this particular moment in time doesn't even think he picked his
Turn your volume up guys, 3:07 Gary farts
Jeremie Aliadiere now there was a signing
No Aguero?
The disrespect to Bergkamp. Ugh
Vardy 💪🏻💙
Kante???
Ronaldo
Ronaldo is the greatest player of all time and therefore is the greatest signing of all time. Not sure what there’s to debate
How can CR7 one of the greatest footballer ever not get in overall.
450k Mahrez easy
Ronaldo is, let’s be honest, the things he did for united
At one point only cats will hear them 2:31
Jamie "ya talk about" carragher..
It’s Henry and no one else
How did Kompany get on the list over Keane who won 7 titles and 4 as captain, including a cl and treble
Vardy hands down, from Fleetwood to winning the league
I won a LEEEAAAAGUE!!!
Sheared full stop
Nope it's gotta be Ali Dia to Southampton for an absolute steal.
I switch the video off when I hear Carra slurping and smacking his lips like an imbecile.
Aguero?!?!?!
All I’m gonna say is the best ever signing in football was Messi. Everyone else is worth millions all Barca had to do for messi was give him hgh.
Ronaldo did more than Kompany. Won more, including the Champions League and was then sold on for a world record fee and massive profit
The biggest thing wirh cantona was the season he moved to utd he had just won the league with leads utd.
Sol Campbell for free.
Babel honcho hypia cara
Its clearly kante. The three of em almost said but just carried on talking over each other about goals scored. Kante took Leicester from 17th to first. Then took Chelsea from 10th to first. If he doesn't play at 8/9 nowadays everyone panics like its not the same kante..  This debate is trash
Kompany didn’t play half the time for city
No Zola? Zola brought new lift the premier league. @Drogba? Drogba won more than all these.
How's Gary Cahill not in this? 7m from Bolton in 2011. 2PL, 1CL, 2FA cups, 1 UEL, 1League cup. Should at least be in the consideration
All the talk of rivalry with Leeds and United over Cantona... Sol Campbell was literally Spurs captain and became an Invincible at ARSENAL come on.. how’s this one been missed
Seamus Coleman 60k
So its between Cantona and Vardy... 1.2m in 1992 or 1m in 2012...  thats what swings it in Vardys favour
Can you class Vardy as a perm signing when he was signed when Leicester were in the championship
in that league winning season, it should be Mahrez over Vardy, but overall I'd say Vardy.
Carra thinks mane is a bigger legend then Ryan giggs.... pathetic
Kompany and hart and aguero all need to be up there (and yes obviously I'm bias)
How the F is vardy a premier league signing? They signed him when he was in the championship. Big error by sky here!
Salah and Robertson were the best bargain of the modern era!
Have they ever agreed on anything? Oh wait, that doesn't make good TV does it.
It's Henry. Not even close
Surely Coutinho has to be on Carras list! Not only was he just £11m but he was sold for £142m and funded VVD and Alisson
Aguero?
CR7 the best signing ever in the Epl, anyone else thinks otherwise is delusional. 3Epl medals, 1champions league medal, 1 clup worlcup medal, Ballondor, Europe best player, Topscorer, Pichichi Trophy. He won everything that was there to win.
Coleman? £60,000
Spot on with the Wijnaldum shout...nowhere near the calibre of those players mentioned
Torres give his best years to Liverpool when Liverpool was in the worst time and Torres not evev on the list,what a shame
Signing fees should be inflation adjusted
No knowledge on leicester at all n we will win it again top 5 side
Jammie and Liverpool are crying
Gary Neville and Carragher are a couple of half wits. Football fans,mute is your best plan
I am a liverpool fan and i'm shocked Peter Schmeichel is not even listed. Possibly the best signing ever.
I don’t care who you support, how can you not put Frank Lampard on that list?!
I swear Dennis Irwin cost 450k from Oldham
Mahrez was only 400k and won the  PL AND PFL and had the highest combined goals and assist for Leicester that season if he was English it would be mahrez on Not vardy
How Schemichel never made the list is bizarre.
Terry an lampard were the backbone for 10 years of domestic domination?  RVP at Man U   Rooney, Rio ten years Apiece at Man U
Ehhh? Peter Schmeichel??? Transfer Fee: £505,000 from Brondby - Trophies Won at United: 15 (including 1999 treble).. You guys are WAY OFF
You missed the HEATED DEBATE headline
It was prior to the EPL, but to me the most important MUFC signing since I supported them in 1979 is Robbo. Before that it always seemed like the best players signed for other clubs, not us. Then out of the blue we broke the transfer record spending a million quid. Robson proved worth every penny. It was like the club finally showed some ambition. Things went on an upward trajectory from there. Current owners spend, but they had spent daft over half the time at least, instead of building a well rounded squad.  I am not sure Ole will ever be the best manager in the world, but he does seem to have an idea about how to sort out the mess the previous three had left him. Just what we needed.  I'd still like to see supporters at least half own the club and elect board members though -- kind of like they do in Germany. Less of this clubs having to pimp themselves out and become a billionaire's plaything (A capital asset too. If you own an investment bank you can leverage against these assets to create huge sums of money with the click of a mouse, i.e., fresh lines of credit they use to acquire more capital assets etc. It's like a magic trick that only they are legally allowed to do)
Lampard ??
Back to seventh and eighth carra
It’s funny that Jamie carragher says Leicester won’t win the league again imagine if Liverpool never win it again in his life time 🤣🤣
Where is lingardinho?
Torres?
What a boring and inaccurate row Same cliches - repetitive and stale ideas and you can’t get away from their Liverpool and Man Utd allegiances A proper and professional presenter would be fair to all clubs in their new career and not let their past be so dominant  Why can’t we have impartial professional presenters change around instead of this boring ex-defenders  At times it reminds me of the MICKEY MOUSE and MINNIE MOUSE cartoons But at least they were entertaining  And it’s been reported that they each get around £1m a year for their average contributions
CANTONA. No discussion here!
I'm a United fan, but Suarez was just unbelievable in his time in the Prem.
3.6 million was the world record transfer fee in 92? Damn, good times
Is no one gonna talk about 60 grand Coleman. The best right back of the last 10 years in the Prem no cap
I know this is to do with the Premier League Era, but everyone has this misnomer that Cantona changed everything at United. It was the signing of Peter Schmeichel in the Summer of 1991 that changed everything at United and made us competetive. Also Kanchelskis that was signed at the same time. Cantona was the icing on the cake.
Where is Lampard? I’m an arsenal fan and he needs to be included on the overall list vardy was signed in the championship not the premier league your titles are misleading
Henry all day. Chelsea fan
Anything other than the king Thierry is wrong.
Anything other than the king Thierry is wrong.
Legend has it if they keep arguing long enough, theyll produce a sound so high pitched  only dogs can hear
Can't argue against Cantona but the one signing that never gets mentioned enough is Dennis Bergkamp to Arsenal £7.5 million.....hated at first by the fans but he wound up being one of the most influential players in his time at the club
How is vieria not on any list 3.6m was in 6 pfa team of the years in a row
Just English players.
FRANK LAMPARD NO DEBATE  STUPID GARY JAMIE... CANTONA ? HAHAHAHA
Stop smacking ya lips together when ya talk carragher please
0:31  Jaime: This is pound for pound best Khaib: Send location
Nevilles list was much better than Carragher’s. Especially with the price tags
F. Torres from Liverpool to Chelsea was the best ever
So many amazing signings not metioned here... two fannys
Alan Shearer is only up there because he is English. He won just 1 piece of silverware...
All those bindippers over 20 years were so good that they won ONLY ONE EPL title.
No Frank Lampard,the all time leading midfielder goal scorer
Honestly don't know where Carra is coming from with his "Leicester won't win the league again" claims. Has he seen them this season? Easily a top 3 team.
Embarrassing that lampard isn't even mentioned on this list..   211 career goals  Only midfield player to score over 150 premier league goals 102 assists Over 10 goals in 10 consecutive seasons.. 3 premier league titles 4 fa cups 2 league cups champions league and europa league..   Signed for 11m.
No Aguero??
Missed Newcastle signing Santiago Nunez. Quality signing the lad.
To be fair can't believe Steve Finnan has been snubbed
My favourite is James Milner for £0. What a bargain.
Ever liverpool old stars try to hide salah legacy ! Jealous
VARDYYYYYYY!!!!! 🙌🏻🦊💙
Eric was very special but Ronaldo for me was very special and continued to be one ......
Cristiano for 12 million.. won 3 leagues in a row.. 1 champions league.. another champions league final.. FA cup and league cup.. 1 Balon d or.. Golden boot.. took Manchester united  to next level in terms of fan support and commercial powerhouse globally.. Changed the sport in terms of training and athleticism .. and finally when he leaves for real madrid makes his club 80 million..
Not sure how Keane doesn’t make that list. Or David Silva. To name just two.
I think Keane at just under 4M should be in there to be honest.
I get the ‘pound for pound’ argument completely, but even as a Spurs fan I can’t ignore the fact that Henry is one of the greatest signings of PL history and shouldn’t be almost excluded from this discussion because he was bought for £11m and sold for £15m or whatever it was.
"The reason Hyypia is on this list is because he's my mate, which is the sole basis for all my punditry"
Two muppets
Ole. £1.5m? Signing of the century!
None of those 5 won the champions league. That has to be a factor. Lampard for £11m was better than signing than Kompany for £6m.
salah is
Only thing i could argue about would be is Vardy a premier league signing? oined them in the championship. Of course a massive impact and has been amazing in the premier league but wasn't a premier league signing so id have Kante in that spot.
Surely the answer is actually Roman Abramovich? 😜
Where’s Sergio Aguero? Arguably the best striker in PL history
Honourable mention for the man united list has to be van Persie 20 million. Pinched from arsenal and top scorer in the year they won the title back from city. Don’t think enough people mention him when they talk about the great premier league strikers. He’s right up there for me
How on earth has Vardy done more for lester than Henry for Arsenal
Vardy?
They argue so frequently like a couple - Neville as husband and Carragher as wife
Where’s Torres? Torres was awesome and we signed him for 20 million.  these two are mad. Sorry if they’ve got Suarez up there then Torres should be there! He came in and lit up the premier league. 33 goals in his first season. Jokers.
Keane £3.6m and Vieira £3m
vards is a championship singing
Thierry Henry is the greatest ever signing in the premier league
Henry, without a shadow of doubt.
John Mcginn 2.5 from Hibs ain't a bad one in this day an age
The witty cannon immunohistochemically wink because colony concomitantly taste plus a grumpy hate. nostalgic, apathetic slipper
blackburn=blahbern
Gary is just not talkin sense. Thats why Valencia didnt do well. Gary doesnt know that much honestly. Carragher knows Hyppia was good. He played alongside him. Wtfish..
No Lampard to Chelsea on this list? Ridiculous. Highest ever goalscorer for club, highest midfielder in prem history, champs league, premier League titles, Europa, cups. Signed from a local rival. Come on lads
Hello everyone from Belarus!  I am very ashamed to make that, but I have no other choice, because in a couple of days my family will be on the street. I'll mortgaged my house and invested in my project, but due to the current situation in Belarus, the investors who were going to invest, refused, now the project is not finished, there is nothing to pay the bills. If some $ doesn't mean anything to you, then it can save a lot for me. I will be very grateful for any help, and I will pray that your kindness will return to you.

Vardy was a Championship signing
As their voices go higher, my ability to understand them decreases
So basically united and Liverpool and talk about rest of the PL for like 2 mins.
How is mane not on the list for Liverpool??! I’m not even a Liverpool fan that’s mad disrespectful!
I like how for vardy they put 24 goals in a season, and didn’t put took Leicester to Champions
Aguero is the greatest premier league signing ever because , he’s been consistently getting 20 goals a season for 8 years
Rooney
Don’t think carra understands how inflation works 😂😂 hyypia over suarez do me a favor
How about torres
1:57 "I thought Jordan Henderson would be in there."   - Gary Neville, 2021
I think the 2.5 million Hull paid Dundee United for Robertson was just as important
Roy Keane. That is all.
Guys how about one of the greatest gk of all time..peter schmeichel?
If its about PL club to PL club then Rooney is hands down the best and its not even close to be honest.  Multiple trophies and top scorer of all time, all while becoming his countries top scorer ever. Speaks for itself.
So biased man, shearer has to be the best, best striker to grace the prem
Is he putting Van Djik last?!
As an Arsenal fan, the fact they didn't mention Aguero and D.silva is absolutely criminal
Henry huge signing
But back then Liverpool never used to challenge for the Premiership...they were a cup team so I disagree with Jamie!
Bobby Zamora??
Aguero ?
Just came for Man United and u know who
Vardy? Lol the chauvinism is big here..
Bergkamp should've been included in the overall list, ugh, results-oriented cats
Where is Frank Lampard!???!?!??? 3 PL titles  8 domestic cups 1 Champions League 1 Europa League Chelsea all time top scorer Highest scoring PL midfielder ever £10 million (from rival as well like cantona!)
5:48 Madisson enters chat
£60,000 Coleman for Everton
How on earth can you not have Phillipe Coutinho in Liverpool’s best premier league signings? Bought for £8.5 million, sold for £145 million a few years later and funded Van Dijk and Allison signings. Indirectly Coutinho is responsible for getting us a Champions League.
sol Campbell for free  Thiery Henry for 10mil Bergkamp for 7.5mil  top three for me
Shock😂😂
Lampard to Chelsea ?!
wheres bruno
One name- Thierry Henry
Harry Maguire should be number 1
VVD
We all know the best signing in history for United was Alexis Sanchez.
👍🏻
I can't understand why is vardy ahead of Aguero and  david Silva ..
Kompany in 2008 cost just 8 million euros, best signing ever.
"Neville and Carragher disagree" What does that even mean? Do you mean they "had a heated discussion"?
Joao Moutinho
Anelka Henry vieria??? Amongst many others.....
Peter Schmeichel should be up there too - bought for nothing and ended up arguabley the best goalkeeper thats ever played.
Henry end of debate
No Fernando Torres?
When they go high pitched 😂😂😂
Jamie Vardy '' Roy Of The Rovers''  C-A-N-T-O-N-A walked on water and he was cracking at Kung Fu god bless him.😈
Vardy was a championship signing, not Premier League.
FRANK LAMPARD
Cantona 1m
Vardy all the way
Ronaldo over Kompany
Jamie Carragher you muppet. Cant listen to a word out of his mouth, poor old bellend. Fancy that one then you muppet.
cup treble........................
Shearer end of debate.
Neville not putting in schmeichel or van der sar is a joke
vardy was a  class signing but they signed him when they wasnt in the prem? so is that classed a premier League signing, i know it says premier League Era, But not for me
If it was around the world. It be Glen Kamara £50k!!!
A better Title would’ve been “Most Cinderella signings of the epl era”. With the exception of Henry and Cantona (who has a Cinderella angle himself that is probably the tie breaker vs other multiple title winning signings), I can name more accomplished signings in the same position. Vidic over Kompany, Rooney  or even Drogba over Vardy or Shearer
Who cares what they think..
Sell Anelka for 20m and buy Thierry Henry and a new training ground with the money...10m for Thierry Henry xD
Shocked you didn’t pick mcallister tbf Jamie
Lampard from west ham to Chelsea?
Salah and Virgil?
Is this the sky sports liverpool & united channel?
Where on earth is Frank Lampard - west ham to chelsea 11 million
they both sound the same when high pitched
People need to get out of there head that Cantona for 1.2 million was expensive for the day. Truth is most transfers no matter who you are was around a million. Even if you were a squad player you were looking at 800k. The same year Dion Dublin was 1 million, Paul Stewart was 2.3 million. Seriously. I mean Paul Stewart was 1.7 million in 1988! Plus Vardy was signed in the championship. If he had been signed in the premiership his fee would of been higher so the "cheap" argument is nonsense. Kante for 5 million in 2015 was just as good a signing for Leicester and they would not have won the league without him either. Cantonas achievements, impact and legacy completely overshadow Vardy for what was even in 92 cheap.
No torres on the liverpool list?
What about,, Great Dane ,,,? Peter schmeichel
Dennis Bergkamp- not just transformative for Arsenal but the whole league!
It’s Thierry Henry, buying a non scoring winger devoid of any confidence for 11mil, converting him to a centre forward and scoring 228 goals and getting 74 assists in 7 1/2 years is just unbelievable
best 2 pundits .. they always take both sides,so cover things well
Easy, Jamie just choose his best partner in CB.
Can't believe a list without Hazard ... The Man carried Chelsea all by himself
Drogba
Ronakk lol so was a better bargain than some if these 🤷🏻‍♂️
Man U will win leagues no matter the manager, big statement and yet to be proven 😂
Jimmy Carragher always spewing lots of nonsense! Total bullshit
Kante was 5.6 mil, should be on here.
Mahrez was like 400k
The Evertonian had to mention the Dirtie's plastic treble didnt he!!
Cesar Azpilicueta
Take a shot every time Carragher smacks his lips together. Wake up next Thursday.
mane is the best signing hahahahahahaha you guys
Robbo is good

DROBGA!!!! 💙
Damn kante should be up there! Without him leicester wont win the title
Has a Leeds fan I'd hate to admit it has to be Cantona. The final piece in the most dominant domestic team of the last 25 years. Fact the year he was banned for the Kung Fu kick was the only year he never won the Championship.
These two are so biased its unreal, barely ever any talk about any other team than liverpool and united 😒
Lol. No Lampard, Cech, Kante, Aguero, Silva, Rooney... this list is a poor fanfic imo
Coutinho should be on there without him there would be no Alisson and Van Dijk
Ronaldo has to be the best signing in the PL era. What he won, for the team and individually.
How can’t be E.hazard top 5 he is one of the best players had Epl.?!
Dennis 'bergkamp for me, he changed the way arsenal played and started an era of dominance
I am eagerly waiting for the heated debate🔥🔥🔥
Leicester paid 5mil for Kante in 2015
No kante?
Mahrez n Kante both more instrumental than Vardy in LEI’s success. Neither were expensive signings either
Err no smichael (peter)!!!??  Kante over vardy (look what happened when he left).  Bale should probably be in the conversation too
CANTDOOOONAH
If you're talking money wise Coutinho because of the profits but for an actual signing easily Salah or VVD for taking us to that next level
Rvp was good signing for united
Ooooh sami sami <3
Nicolas Anelka for Arsenal 200k from PSG wasn’t a bad signing
What’s that sound @3:07 ?
I swear Leicester bought Vardy when they where playing in the championship does that even count.
I’m a man united fan and I think gini wijnaldum is a bloody fantastic signing for Liverpool . Rarely loses the ball, can dribble, pass, score, defend and gives you everything. If he had a better shot on him, he’d be talked about as one of the best midfielders in the world. Cantona number 1 though, vardy number 2.
Frank Lampard???
This is such rubbish that Didier Drogba doesn't make the cut for top Premier League signing.
They could have adjusted it for inflation
Coutinho for 5million?
peter Schmeichel....£505,000 for the best goalkeeper the premier league has ever seen.......there's a better signing than that????
Salty carra doesn't pick torres because he went to Chelsea
what a disagreement....
Outfield players only it looks like. But if you're adding a GK, it's gotta be Petr Cech, no? 7mil he cost Chelsea from Rennes. 15 yrs later a shed full of trophies.
peter schmeichel and eric cantona , were united most important signings ,form 92-97 those titles were the foundation for united s future success and ability to attract players , but  really Schmeichel was major factor in uniteds success in 90s ,,
"Leicester was the hardest one" And you still got it wrong ya idiots.
Surprised Neville didn't have Pogba on there
Carra reckons leicester wont win the league again... bit strange opinion to be honest maybe shouldn't state things like that when the teams joint 2nd more than halfway through the year
Ronaldo has to be in the top 5, absolutely ridiculous!!!
I think chelsea signing hazard was one the best premier league signings ever
cantona Lampard Vardy in that order  edit Henry before lampard my bad
Leicester will win league again
On value for money I think Seamus Coleman has to get a mention. 60k was a bargain for 300 plus games. Albeit not winning anything but in this day with the mad prices its a bargain
These man really putting these guys over Henry 😂😂omg my man came took arsenal to invincibles, golden boot winner best foreign player and player to play in the premier league
coutinho should definitely be on that liverpool list. he kept liverpool competitive with a waning gerrard balotelli and an atrocious back line
Vardy wasn't a premier league signing 🤔
The discovery of Vardy is a masterclass, put any of the other player in leicester, even cantona and they may not have win anything. Vardy should have moved to a bigger club during his peak after winning the league for the fox, it will put him in a better position to be a better player. Leicester don't have the $$$ to build a team big enough to really compete for the ucl and focus on the league at the same time.
Gary Neville is losing the plot lately.  Wijnaldum over Hyypia LMFAO.  Wijnaldum scored those two goals against Barca and that's pretty much it. He's a decent, functional midfielder that has otherwise made little difference over any other midfielder that would have started if he wasn't there.  Absolutely no drop-off in performance at all when he's out injured.
The disrespect on Lampard and Dennis Bergkamp though smh
Agueroooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!
Was getting Kanté, a totally unknown midfielder from a SECOND DIVISION French team for £5.6M not one the smartest transfer in history? He was THE player in that title winning side.
HEATED discussion
1:48 and the room goes silent.
Thierry Henry- He was bought for £11 million by Arsenal, and went on the be one of the best ever premier league players ever.
Torres should be in the liverpool top 5
The best signings imo are: Vvd Salah Robertson Bruno C. Ronaldo Van Der Sar
wheres the liverpool god andy carrol
What “success” did Liverpool have under Houlier??
Saurez hands down
Controversial call but I'd put Allison ahead of Robertson only because Liverpool hadn't won a trophy for seven years before we signed him.
Theirry Henry. Henry was unbelievable and he came as a nobody and sort of failed at Juventus. The player he became has to be the best signing.
Kante obviously #1
Lampard to Chelsea from West ham ahead of Kompany
Cantona all day
For sheer impact on the Premier League I would say Dennis Bergkamp, first world class talent in the Premier League and triggered a complete change in the philosophy of the professional game in the Premier League. From when he signed players started getting coached better, sports nutrition got better, sports science started getting better. From that moment the professionalism of the players in the Premier League got better, and the game in the Premier League shifted from being mainly based on physicality, after he signed the game started to flow to the technical ability of the players, all the above are reasons why the Premier League is the best league in the world now, it was lagging behind Italy due to the lack of professionalism of the players and coaches and the game is far better for it.
@3:07 one of em drops their guts
Lol vardy being picked over the greatest to grace the PL Henry
Keaneo
Ronaldo.
But they end up agreeing in the end??
‘Leicester won’t win the league’? Give us 5:6 more years and we’ll be dominating premier league
Eric Cantona
It was quite a “heated” disagreement
vardy wasn't a premier league signing
‘Leicester won’t win the league again’ - came 5th last season and sitting in 3rd this season. Not far off at all.
As a Liverpool fan, it's Cantona. He began the Fergie era of dominance, most important signing in prem history
Can we get a Gary Neville Ooooooooooogasm compilation?
Nuno Espirit Santo donated £250,000 to feed the children fund, so Jamie Carragher are you still in?
Two Brits trying to get as many Brits on the list some loads of bollox
No Irwin? Come on Gary.
Lampard ??????
Denis Irwin?
As a Leeds fan still gutted we gave Cantona away to the red side for 1.2 million WTF! no league title for 25 years we gave cantona away then 4 titles in 5 seasons :(
How no coutinho? 🤔 cost about 10 mil and sold for like 140 🤔
I reckon Ashley Cole should get a mention
king drogba!
Frank Lampard to Chelsea should be on that list
No Frank Lampard?? 😳
kompany no.  silva aguero ronaldo etc
the disrespect to henry and campbell is mad!!
How on God’s green earth has Carra left Henderson off his list?
Gary donkey Neville. Best manager ever yeah? Valencia?
Neville talking some nonsense about the Liverpool players here.
how lamps isn't there is beyond me
Why isn’t Roy mean too 7 prem titles?
This should be uploaded to the Sky Sports HEATED YouTube channel
How Bergkamp isn’t mentioned is disgraceful, without him Arsenal would never have gone on to win the 3 titles we did or sign players like Henry, Viera and Pires, it all’s started with Dennis. Very similar story with cantona and United
If you're a united fan you have to say Peter Schmeichel for 500k in 91. He changed goalkeeping in the PL.
Here for “where’s heated” comments
How seamus coleman isn't in this for monetary value alone is shocking. He was bought for 30k ...   That's the price of an extension
Dennis bergkamp
Don’t understand how Vardy is in here when he was signed by Leicester in the championship. I agree with the other 4 though, I’d maybe include Aguero though
Henry just got disrespected in this conversation, so biast.
Irwin cmon
1. Rooney 2. Lampard  3. Ronaldo 4. Vardy 5. Cantona The fact United got all that out of CR7 then turned over £60m on him could arguably put him top.
Kante should definitely be on the list
Frank Lampard done more for Chelsea than any of those 5 players did for those clubs🤔 Only Vardy and Cantona you can factor in the fee to argue they’re better deals
Peter schmichael.
Shocked that this never had ‘HEATED’ in the title
Cesar azpi was 2 mill and unreal
HEATED ARGUMENT
Toré Andre Flo!    Signed by Chelsea in 1997 for £300k helped the Blues win an FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and 2 European Trophies before being sold just 3 years later to Rangers for £12m   Making him, at the time, the most expensive Norwegian player, Rangers record transfer AND the most expensive player in Scottish history
Cantona every day of the week and twice on Sunday, Cantona changed the entries club, most influential player in United recent history.
When they put Alan shearer 34 goals in 94-95 season, was that all comps or accidentally put it for Prem.
Do they ever agree with each other?
I'm not even a city fan, but the fact Aguero isn't on that overall list is shameful
HEATED
Vardy 1m kompany 6m aguero 32m
How much did United pay for CR7?? Ballon D'or winner
You are probably looking at Ronaldo. You got to ask the question, would he achieved his greatness had he stopped at Sporting Lisbon? Moving to United was a masterstroke from Fergie and ultimately the best ever signing.
Should have adjusted the price for inflation.
Didn't they agree? I'd call that an agreement at the end.
I'm a Man United fan but shouldn't James Milner be there on a Free?
Lampard to Chelsea? Over vardy...
Kay 99 makes post gets 450 likes, phone makes exact same post an hour after Kay 99 and gets 750 likes. That hurts bro
Vardy?! Yall high lmfao.
Denis Irwin has to be on that list. Agree with Eric. Shearer sorry way down on the list.
I can't believe there was no mention of Jessie Lingard
It's Ronaldo easy.....he was sold 6 years later for 85mil
Thought Cuntana was a farmer 🚜
Suarez was a great player but as a signing for Liverpool what did he achieve for them before biting off matey's ear
Eric Cantona won the league and two doubles and one near enough single handedly.. He scored amazing goals matched with iconic celebrations, the man was a film star, rock star and footballer rolled into one and started the kick it out movement at selhurst Park.. Long live Eric the king.
A disgrace Dennis Irwin wasn’t mentioned.
£ for £ Arsenal signing anelka
Should had eric djemba djemba on that list
Oh no it isn't , oh yes it is , classic children's pantomime
If city win the quad Dias has to be top as most Influential
Where's Coutinho??? £8.5 million and they sold him for £142 million or something stupid.
Aguero has to be up there for me.
What’s that bubbling sound at 3:08?
Mind blowing that Sky the biggest football broadcaster in UK aren't aware that vardy wasn't a premier league signing!
Joe Gomez for a about a tenner from Charlton
a dont do ifs buts and maybes i do absouloutes
Lampard ?!
For me it is undoubtedly jamie vardy
No Peter Schmeichel? Half a million from Brondby and goes on to become the best keeper in the world whilst playing a major role in the procuring of a champions league and multiple league titles and FA Cups??
No mention on henry even if he made the list..hmm..
Jamie “Broooknow Feenandez” Carragher
Proper heated debate this
Where is Bergkamp? He was the precursor for change at arsenal and the philosophies adapted by clubs who tried to follow the arsenal footprint of foreign creativity.
Peter Schmeichel
I'm a united fan but Dennis bergkamp should be in.
Eric Cantona, all day. 👑🔴
No Alonso !
No mention of Titus Bramble?
Did someone fart at 3:07 right after Neville said Leeds. Anyone else hear that?
Many PL signings can be considered the best for their own reasons but for the way the PL era was formed & dominated by Man Utd in the early 90s, it has to be Eric Cantona for £1.2m
Kante could go on the list twice. He went to two mid table teams and got them titles the very next year.
Why isn’t cr7 in overall best signing ?  The guy won everything and the ballondor with united. None of the others won a ballondor
Nah I'm sorry how is Ronaldo not number 1. Come to United for like 12 million.  Won everything in 6 years and become world player of the year the went for 80 million. Impact he had on United was different class along with prime Wazza
Where coutinio
Eden Hazard has to be there.
Neville: I think those are right  Carra: Thats why you put them there
Sergio Aguero?
Please someone at sky sports clip that moment Jamie said Leicester can’t win the league again
Where is Gary neville podcast this week
vardy doesnt get talked enough because he doesnt play in the top 6
Where is Peter Schmeichel on your list Gary? United got him for free almost, and his impact was almost as big as Cantonas bringing United to the top.
Ryad Mahrez > Jamie Vardy
6 minute debate and not mentioned Thierry Henry once even though he is on that list is a disgrace to football. Say no more
Arsenal fans are like, what about Ozil?
Henryyyyyyy
seamus coleman.
Eric Cantona 4 PL titles in 5 seasons. Nuff said.
No Lampard? Baffled
Surely its jordan henderson.  16 million. Captain that won all the cool trophies
Henry allday
Thierry Henry is the best ever premier league signing ever for how much Arsenal paid and what he achieved
What about Schmeichel....
Cantona. Best signing.
Shocked theres no HEATED in the TITLE
Van Persie to United? Carried them to the title too
David silva sergio Aguero are the best signings
Pretty sure Leicester weren't in the Prem when they signed Vardy!
Was it heated?
We claim 3 of the best ever signings:   • Luis Suarez  • Mohammed Salah • Virgil Van Dijk
Can wait for sky sports retro to upload this when leicester next win the prem.
Vardy for me all day, for what he's done not only with the team but own personal records is unbelievable, the type of player you see come around once every 100 years
They're getting paid to disagree each other. What do you expect.🤯
When will we get sick of these two muppets !
wouldve said keane by a mile tbh
Lampard? Drogba? Cech? Ronaldo? Aguero? just a few names that immediately come to mind.
They spoke about everyone except Henry I’m not having it 😡😡😡
Jamie & Gary have heated debate over best ever premier league signing
Lampards gotta be in there
Come on Sky, Jamie Vardy wasn't even a PL signing!!!
David Silva and Sergio Aguero not even being mentioned in this conversation is criminal.
Were Leicester in the PL when they signed Vardy?
Oh yeah because ??  Oh I forgot he’s white  He was no way a better player then mahrez that season or Kante
Petition for sky sports not to mention man u or Liverpool for one day
Seamus coleman
That Manchester United 5 is GOAT AFTER GOAT 👏
Vardy wasn’t a Premier League signing lads
Karius and Maguire best singings for both
Best signing(s) of the Premier League era: 2002 - Youri Djorkaeff and Jay-Jay Okocha (Bolton)  Changed the culture of an entire football club.
Definitely Bruno or Cantona
It is amazing that 'HEATED' is not in the title when there is disagreement at Sky Sports.
Cantona for me. At the time he provided what we needed to take us that one step further and win the league. I don't believe alot of what happened afterwards would have done so without that signing.
Cantona. And I'm a Liverpool supporter but what he brought to Utd was the final piece that laid the foundation for their entire run, and not only that, but living through that time, he was a total poster boy and media headline that brought more eyes to the Premier League (or Premiership as it was called) during its early years that seriously helped the brand.
No discussions of Chelsea signings like Lampard, Cech or Drogba but they mentioned even Jordan Henderson in passing? Definitely a bias lol
Carragher is just a tad deluded
Carragher has turned into a puppet now
Firey and heated debate gone wrong
Where is HATED debate??
How is Mané not in the best singings The turn over of Liverpool started with him
Am I on the wrong channel? Where’s heated?
£1.2m then was loads.
Ronaldo for 12m has to be one of the best signings in history
This has got to be the worst video on the Internet, so ignorant
Eric Cantona, a million quid. Done
Imagine not including lampard in that list, hilarious
Sky sports =United Liverpool sports so boring. Other clubs exist
No Bergkamp?
Hazard? 30 mil from Lille bargain
Not putting Ronaldo? He won every single individual trophy in the world in 08 and 3 titles plus cl undefeated including fa cups and carling cup. None of those players won what cristiano won
Cristiano Ronaldo is number 1. Bought for £12m, won us 3 League titles and a champions League, entertained the crowd, won the balondor, cemented Man United status as one of the biggest teams in the world, then sold for a £70m profit. Will Never happen again!
No mention of Vardy's 11 out of 11 record goal scoring? if he had played for anyone but Leicester there would be no question of who is the greatest signing. But good old Sky asks an ex Liverpool player and an ex-Man United player.  No wonder no one watches SKY anymore. So bias and out of touch with the vast majority of football fans. They are hemorrhaging subscribers left right and center.
Frank Lampard for 11mil, absolute steel. Should of been ahead of Kompany. Dont think the guy played a full season.
Without a doubt ronaldo should be in the overall signings
Surprised they didn't talk about Ronaldo more. Ronaldo, Henry, and Cantona for me.  The PL is a complete bore compared to the talent we used to have.   We're now watching Sterling, Jesus, Werner, Lacazette, Rashford, Martial... talk about shite.  Salah and KdB are about the only two I can think of at the moment that light the PL up. Possibly Bruno Fernandes too.
Vincent Kompany lol
Thierry Henry!????? 😂😂😂😂 Number 1. Fact.  Invinvibles. A feat never done again. GET OUT
If Thierry Henry is the greatest premier league player to grace the league, wouldn’t he not be the best greatest ever signing?! I’m confused they didn’t even mention Henry.
Is it me or does the Wolves logo stand out among the other clubs in MNF's panel?
How can you not have Schmiecal or Lampard
Not putting Ronaldo? He won every single individual trophy in the world in 08 and 3 titles plus cl undefeated including fa cups and carling cup. None of those players won what cristiano won
If azpilicueta is not in this I’m unsubing 😒
Famous quotes,   “I come to win,” “Lingard inspired me to play football”, “Oooooooooo”, And  “THERE”.
that was the most disgusting fart ever at 3:08
Vardy wasn't signed in the Premier League. Leicester were in the Championship when they signed him so it doesn't count.
Wijnaldum? Neville is a joker, I can never take him seriously and he's so biased usually
As a United fan, Cantona was the best signing United have ever made in terms of impact on the team. The best signing overall in the premier league in terms of value, impact and contribution to the team has to be Vardy though. World record transfer fee in 1992 was £10m. That makes the Cantona signing equivalent ~£20m today. Vardy was signed for £1m from a non-league side and was the focal point in a 5000-1 Premier League championship campaign and has been the main man in the side ever since even winning the golden boot last term. Best ever signing by a country mile.
Man united got Cantona, Ronaldo, Keane , Rooney & vidic for 50.9 million . Liverpool got Van dijk for 75mil. hahahah
Carra left alonso out of his Liverpool signings ????????
Kim Kallstram
Bruno ferandes
Got to be Vardy
JC: “Leicester won’t win the league again”  …Neither Will Liverpool 🤣
Carrager is worthless, please fire him
Jamie 'Vacuum Cleaner' Carragher
Bruno Fernandes has to be up there for Man United
Noone said the magic h word yet?
love robbo but we got Coutinho for 8.5m
Lampard overlooked once again
Denis Irwin? I think Sir Alex said that was one of his best ever signings
I appreciate the more frequent uploads ...... Thanks guys
As a Chelsea fan I'd have to give it to Cantona. The deciding factor for me is the fact that on top everything else they also managed to disarm a direct rival, Leeds haven't won the league since. I think Chelsea are looked as always. Lampard for 11mil? Hazard for 35mil? Because in my eyes resale value is a factor as well. We got outstanding service from him, he lit up the league. Then we go n get a 100mil or whatever, at the age of 28/29. Excellent business. Obviously Ronaldois way up there as signing. There's so many really. As others have pointed out, vardy was signed In the championship
Why don’t you discuss teams not in the top six?
well, since Henry is the greatest ever PL player it has to be him, but Cantona is a special case no doubt
Bergkamp has got to be in there, one of the first major stars to come in an international transfer. Man was top 3 in the Ballon D’or twice
What would a bang average ex football player like Carragher know about greatness? He never even won a league title🤫
How is bruno not there he is the best
3:08 Jamie Farted!
C'mon now Frank Lampard to Chelsea from West Ham. So much value there. Greatest scoring midfielder of all time. Titles galore.
Patrick Vieira. Leader and legend. 🔥
Arsenals most important signing in the premier league era would have to be Wenger. He completely reinvented the game in England at which Fergie also adapted to.  Wengers first 10 years in charge have to be considered the most influential for any club in the Premier league era. Some of the best football this league has ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The 2002-2004 Arsenal sides played football beautifully.
What about Ngolo Kante?
Vidic over kompany all day wtf
Schmeichel for 500K. End of.
I’d say pound for pound Coutinho was Liverpool’s best premier league signing, bought for cheap, sold for a fortune, it financed the VVD, Alisson and Fabinho transfers. I’m not saying he was a better player than Suarez, Torres or Salah etc. However signing him, lead to them buying the players they needed to win their first premier league title.
Could make an argument for eden hazard 32 million to be one the best chelsea players for 7 years and still be able to get 70 million profit for him
Why when they put Ronaldo stuff they don’t put the ballon dor there ? Bro is the only Player that won ballon dor since 2000. Also how can you put anyone above CR7 in premiere best SIGNING? What hasn’t he won in England ?
Petr Cech 7million.
The best transfer was Man Utd signing Alan smith
Ruud Gullit on a Free, more so for what he would do as player-manager and the list of players he would sign, Zola, Vialli, etc. Even credited bringing other internationals like Bergkamp to the PL
Denis Irwin was a good buy!
I think Roy Keane has to be Man Utd's number 1 signing of the PL era. The fans are absolutely obsessed with Cantona and rightly so, but it's important to remember the long term impact that Keane had which included captaining United to a treble winning season and instilling the winning attitude in that team which took them to new heights.
Hazard is not in their list BTW and Suarez is in their list, it’s not making any sense at all, Garry Cahill is not in that list but Andy Roberson is in the list, I do not get it all. Sky sports is not for two teams and they are not working Man U and Liverpool Televisions.
I wish Gary put pogba on his list just to see carras reaction 😂
How is Gary Cahill not there
Ronaldo?
They really saying liverpool won the treble 😂😂
Seamus Coleman would be here if  Everton had achieved anything in the last 10 years
Amen
Not these two muppets again!
So it's Liverpool and united propaganda once again
60 grand Seamus Coleman doesn't get mentioned
Best signing : Ole Gunnar Solskaer.!>*
I can still remember my dad going crazy when cantona left Leeds for Manchester United or in my dads words Scum united  😂😂😂
Seamus coleman
Jamie is very very deluded. I think this is pretty obvious
Should be David Silva there. He was an absolute bargain just 25m and the greatest midfielder I've ever seen and the key of City being the best team the last decade. Of course Kompany was the captain and a leader but in the field was completely David
How is Nemanja Vidić not on that list!!  - £7 million. He won 5 Premier League titles and a champions league
Lampard should be there. 11m from West Ham.
Virgin van Dijk has won 4 major trophies? Champions league, Club World Cup and Premier league. What's the 4th one?
They’d argue over who has the most £millions if there was nothing else to debate
Coutinho needs a mention
Absolute levels in what the Manchester United players achieved compared to Liverpool’s.
Sky the garbage pundit always mentioned about former team mates. Henry, Vieira, Berkanp, Drogba, Lundberg, Aguero, Periz, Ronald, Mane, Ginola, Dicanio, Vedic, Yaya Ture, Zola,  etc.. The best signing for English premier league foreign players.
Sol Campbell!
N'Golo Kanté would be a better shout than Vardy. Kanté was brought into an almost relegated Leicester City side from French Ligue 2 team Caen for £5.6 million in August 2015, going on to win his team's POTY award & the 2015/16 Premier League in his only season there. He was the difference between the team that struggled and the team that conquered. Also Vardy was a Championship signing.
Oh Sky Sports taking about Utd and Liverpool again....shock
Wait??? No Cristiano Ronaldo in the best signings of all time in the Prem Era?!
You cant have Vardy in there wtf hahahahahaha
Wijnaldum is soo under rated
not sure how Irwin is not on the united one, even Keane rated him
Neville is just a joke, this hyypia story proves his limitations
Bollocks.  How is lampard not in there?
Thierry henry definitely the best 👌🏽
Fully expected Neville to put Pogba in the list.
kante over vardy imo
Not saying the best ever, but Mahrez to Leicester was a great signing.
No Lampard??
Give some love to keepers. Schmeichel to United for £505,000, Van der Sar to United for £2 million and Cech to Chelsea for £7 million. Three insane signings considering what they went on to accomplish
Lampard for sure ??
the most HEATED arguement i've ever seen
Jamie Vardy didn't move to a premier league team when he joined Leicester so I wouldn't count him. Surprised Agüero isn't on that list
Roy Keane for 3.5million, record signing at the time but still a amazing deal.
Ssssshéerra? Shearer 🙌
When their voices go high pitched it’s too funny😂😂😂
Carra and Neville arguing  Keane : it's their job!
5:46😂
Vardy was not a premier league signing wow sky.
cristiano ronaldo......any other answer is the wrong answer
Carragher picking Vardy as the best is predict able cos he is still playing, he's not gonna shag you mate. Not a Arsenal can but Henry by far, even Eric or Bergkamp cos they influenced top quality foreigners to come to UK and in doing so made the game better. Every kid in London even rival fans wanted to play like Henry, his right foot finish was iconic  BTW can we stop hearing about Liverpool n United all the time I know you love sucking them off but there is other teams in the league like Palace lol
Paul McGrath was the best signing ever 4 Aston Villa
Can anyone translate Carra for me ? 🙌  😅
Laughable really having Kompany ahead of Drogba, Lampard and Cech. As others have said about Vardy..was signed in the championship so doesn't really count. Cantona for sure has to be no.1 though.
The Overall.... The calibre of players on that list for the price that was paid, compared to what you get for your £££ in todays game..... Woooooooooooooooooooooow!!!!!!! Wtf has happened!!!!!!! Cantona also should be top, not shearer.
Such a "HEATED" debate
This channel is just about Livarfools and Manchester unishit  👎👎👎
What succes is Carra talking about. Succes means winning PL
Vardy by a mile
At some point their voice pitch will be so high that only dogs will hear them argue
Its mad how aguero hasn't been mentioned in this video  And I'm a liverpool fan saying this 😂
fair play for adding Vardy to the list but he was signed when Leicester were a championship club not a premier league club...
Thierry Henry and this is from a Liverpool fan.
Patrick Viera is always one people forget about. The price Arsenal payed for him and then for him to go on and be one of the best midfielders the Prem has ever seen plus all the trophies. (I'm not an arsenal fan btw)
no Schmeichel  on Gary's list 😂😂
sky contradicting themselves. A weeks ago said that ronaldo is the best signing, now they don't pick him for top 5. Absolute joke
Frank Lampard has to be there. 11 mil, and the rest speaks for it self.
I don't know, sounded like a heated debate to me.
Aguero
pires   drogba
2:30 When they start arguing in high pitched voice
I think my take is van dijk is more important than MO SALAH. Just my opinion. I think without van dijk no prem or champions leagues.
Best signing ever is Henry and best player in prem history
Frank Lampard? Won everything there was to win and became the clubs top goalscorer
Aguero robbed.
I don't know how Carragher didn't put Torres. Torres made us title challengers it was only the defence aka LB and RB that cost us the league 😒
Jamie “ermm” carragher
Im a united fan and the best signing by far is Vardy United were already decent with huge support and finances, an institution. Second would be Ronaldo. As he is arguably the greatest player to every play the game alongside messi.
How can Jamie Carragher leave out James Milner & Gary McAllister on free transfers for Liverpool best signings of the history that give 2001 & 2019 squads a winning mentality.
Was it not HEEEEAAAATTTEDDDD 🥵🥵🤬🔥🔥🔥
He said pound for pound, I'd have replaced vvd for torres. Vvd was the record signing for a defender at that point in time.
This makes no sense u do realise 5 grand back in 95 is now worth 25 now this is silliness should've thought about this
Cantona is overrated
£1.2m for Cantona....end of.
Ronaldo not in the top 5 for the PL? Blasphemy.
Jamie Vardy for me.
Can we please not forget that Thierry Henry is the best player to ever play in the premier league
Blah blah blah HEATED
Ronaldo for me, 5 years in England, helped united win the league and CL, became one of the best ever and ultimately left seeing united receive almost 70million pound profit. Yes it’s a boring answer but for me it’s Ronaldo
Got to be cantona
Vardy wasn’t a premier league signing tho. Signed him in the championship.
Sadio Mane???
It has to be ERIC THE KING 👑   "If ever there was one player, anywhere in the world, that was made for Manchester United, it was Cantona," Ferguson said. "He swaggered in, stuck his chest out, raised his head and surveyed everything as though he were asking: 'I'm Cantona. How big are you? Are you big enough for me?'"  Cantona's desire for extra training each day opened the eyes of team-mates used to clocking on and clocking off at the usual time. The manager, too. "He opened my eyes to the indispensability of practice," Ferguson said.
3:08 someone farted
Hows Vardy not number 1...1million in the modern era??
Vardy for me !
How about mahrez at few hundred thousand 😆 what a joke list
Carragher is an ill-educated bin dipper and I treat his opinions in the same manner he treats fans of any team but Liverpool. With disdain and a bit of saliva.
Does sky know the definition of disagree?
Muhammad Salah has to be top
Are we forgetting that Vardy was a Championship signing? Not an actual premier league signing, by the structure of the question Vardy can't be included amongst possible candidates. Simply change the question or remove Vardy as an option.
"Disagreed..." no they didn't 🤣🤣
Frank Lampard £11m - record Chelsea goal scorer, 3 titles, 1 CL and a million domestic cups.
I don't know when we will say another player win the ballondor while in the primere league
Wasn't Vardy signed in the championship?
He played against man utd in a friendly and by halftime all the guys were saying to fergie,sign this kid up he's the real deal. And ferguson signed him before the match finish and the rest they say is history. He won everything the year he won the ballondor and he was a winger,being top goals scorer,PFA player of the year,Fa cup,bpl,UEFA best player everything he won and finished that season with 40+goals and assists. Ronaldo was a top top player in football at united,he was up there with the very best and he did become the best.
Vieira. 4 Million
Surprise Surprise Gobshite Neville picks a Man Utd player 🙄
Cantona for me ,he is first iconic premier league signing since premier league started in 90s.
£12m for a 17 yr old who would turn into the 2nd best player in football history surely the best signing?
Request for Sky Sports/Sky Sports Retro to create the best “THEREE” and “OOOOOOOoooOo” compilation
Is FIFA World Cup really a Major trophy? I understand that the winners of CL is the only team in Europe but come on the competition is terrible in that tournament
How can this be your top 5 all time primere league signings list and Cristiano Ronaldo is not in it??????!!!!!! He's the last player to win a Ballondor while playing in the primere league and at that time was the best player in the world
Sol Campbell on a free from Spurs. 2 PL titles and 2 FA Cups in 5 years, as the leader in defence of Wenger's 2nd great team.
what about sadio mane??? criminally underated
Best signing has to be kepa! So much disrespect
Kolo touré has to be there imo
Henry or Keane for me
Xabi alonso?
Carragher's British accent god damn 😅😅
Jamie Vardy has to be the best signing in history
If Jamie fancies Sami hippya why not nominate himself
It's impossible to make a list like this with so few players. notable absences: Dennis Bergkamp, Edwin Van Der Sar, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, James Milner to Liverpool, Santi Cazorla, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Petr Cech, Sergio Aguero and on and on and on.  edit: Jay Jay Okocha.
To imagine people compare bruno to cantona in 2021. Smh....
What a boring and biased selection.   Vardy is easily the best of those mentioned. You have to gauge it against cost.
Liverpools is klopp utds is Cantona
Bruh where’s Coutinho we bought him for like 12 mil and sold him for 142 million
Leicester weren't even in the PL when they signed Vardy. Don't know how he counts.
Vardy isn’t a premier league signing I swear Leicester had him in the championship?
Aguero. Literally transformed City into the serial winners they are currently.
The grrrrrreatest
Vardy is soo underrated. Massive respect to the guys for picking him.
I'm sorry but ronaldo over vardy for sure
Can’t argue with Eric. Perhaps Henry, Schmeichel, Keane
One could say this is HEATED
Has to be CR7 Mam United made 68mn in profit and won 1 UCL 3 EPL 1 Fa Cup. Pound for pound he was the best. After that it's Vardy. He helped Leicester get into Pl and perhaps into Europe
Frank lampard 1000%
What about Vorin (Paris) lol
Vardy 🔥🔥🔥😍🎸🎸💙
Shoulda called this best bargain signings in history.
Lampard should be there
It has to be Vardy
Imagine a signing that over 6 years scores 118 goals as a winger, gives you a huge help in winning 3 PL 1 CL and 5 more trophies and his cost buy/sell is +£70M.
Neville and Caragher have a HEATED debate over the best ever signings
Before watching my first thought was cantona so im sticking with it from an Ipswich fan !
great
Two players i would have loved City to have signed would be Roy Keane and Cantona both immense players.
Vardy was signed in the championship get your facts right
Coleman 60 grand
No Lampard or Eden Hazard?  Blasphemous
How can Ronaldo not be in the top 5 all time in the premier league? He won a bal on dor at United we wouldn’t win the champions league and league double in 2008 without him and he then earns us a world transfer record when he left. He’s number one for me.
Lord Harry maguire is the greatest signing ever
Hyypia run slower than a blackpool donkey ! 🤣🤣🤣
Leicester won win the league again 🤣🤣
Leicester were in the championship when they signed Vardy. . .
Mad aguero didn’t even get a mention
Eric contana
Wouldn't be MNF without a good old Neville - Carragher disagreement
Actually, it's Thierry Henry. Came in as an unrated winger, ended as a top striker, an invincible, the highest foreign scorer, season goals and assist record yet unbroken (only matched by Messi).
"Manchester United signed Schmeichel on 6 August 1991 for £505,000,[17] a price described in 2000 by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson as the "bargain of the century."
Eric Cantona. Rant over !
and Yet thierry Hemry is best ever premier league player , cantona couldnt make it into to france team
This got a little HEATED didnt it?
Carragher and Neville disagree WTF... never thought id see the day!
No way he's put Hyppia in there 😂
Seamus Coleman for 60k has to be on the list
Frank Lampard  £11m 🥱
Frank Lampard for sure is one
Sol Campbell to Arsenal free
It wasn't 'HEATED'?
Where can i watch the full thing now?
cristiano ronaldo was not the greatest prem signing, if you think that you know nothing about football or the prems history... but you can say he was the greatest player that was signed from the premier league for real madrid because he was an absolute monster a different player when he went to real madrid
Vardy broke Van Nistlerooys record for scoring in 11 consecutive games, galvanized the team from the front to fight and press at levels they have never experienced before, cost 1 million and has since become a golden boot winner against some serious competition.
When Gary Neville argues with his wife, it’s his voice that goes higher
Heated
They never even talked about Henry
Thiago?
Coutinho was a great player (for 5 years) and was sold for £130 million in profits, and not on the list?
Ronaldo from Lisbon?
BREAKING NEWS: Neville and Cara disagree again
Both carra and gazza's voices must be 'heated' due to the high pitchness
Best signing has to be one that Man City have made - Kompany, Silva or Aguero
The disrespect for Pepe is appalling....
‘Jaime and gary disagree’ no
SOP CAMPBELL !!!!!
Mo Salah and Bruno Fernandes have to be right up there, at least in recent years.
SOL CAMPBELL !!!!!
King Eric 👑 One in a million, words can't even describe ❤️ Never ever will be forgotten, ever!!!! GGMU
SOL CAMPBELL !!!!!
Man United getting Ronaldo for 12 million that's the best
I think vardy being cheaper the cheaper transfer out him and Cantona even after 20 years just pips it for me. Has to be Vardy.
SOL CAMPBELL !!!!!
HEATED debate?
Ronaldo
Surely vardy
£75m for one of the greatest signings idk about that one boss
Who would you rather have like for Van Dijk comment for Vidic
Can you imagine either of these arguing with their wife's? What a scene that'd be🤣
Man like Henry 🤘🏿
Ever since bruno came in i think united were reliant on him but not the GREATEST signing of all time probably ronaldo.
aguero.
Vardy! :/
Not heated Bros,,this time disagreement
I’d argue Bergkamp was a more important transfer to Arsenal than Henry

Roy Keane Podcast  Make it happen Shky
Veron was good...
Forget best Liverpool signings, Salah’s one of the best prem signings.
Roy Keane. Hands down.
It has to be Andy Robertson for 10 Million for Liverpool and then Overall it has to be Jamie Vardy for 1 Million. I hate Manchester United so I won't comment on there players lol.
The match on the Dyche v. Klopp undercard
Ronaldo is the greatest signing
Can't believe they didn't mention sir Harry maguire.
