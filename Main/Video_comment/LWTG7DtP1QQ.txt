Omg
You have the cutest kids 🥰🥰😍
The wine bottle thing is for travel cause you don’t want your glass wine bottle to break and make a mess and spill everywhere 😊
I know I’m seeing this video like a year later 😂 but.. those wine things. I got one for my step mom for Christmas at Walmart and I LOVED the one I got her, it was like a red plaid and I fell in love with it. Well a bottle of wine fits in the larger bottle. But so does like a lot of coffee.. so my husband bought me mine and he said something about coffee and , in terms of wine, I think it would be nice to keep a bottle of wine cold if need be. Cause the stainless steel and all. But, in turn, keeps stuff hot ya know. Coffee. So that’s all I’ve used my wine set for, I love that the cups are smaller cause then my coffee doesn’t cool down too fast as a huge cup. A small cup is easier to reheat/toss if I need to.. so I know you’re not big on wine but you do like coffee!! And Flynn may be into some sports soon when/where you may need some coffee! Lol 😂  My son is just a little younger than Flynn so I definitely have to put in a little note cause I honestly don’t know how I would have made it through the last few months of my pregnancy with him if I didn’t find your videos from being pregnant with Flynn.  😘
the goli is a weight loss company
It’s not a Colleen video without a burp video in it 😂
I love how she said that it is sexist and I have bras with pockets lolllll
RACHEL TESTED THE PAPER SOAPS
You are the same as my mom she has one oldest son and 2 twin daughters
falling behind on your main channel but keeping up with vlogs and coming back to this video it's wild to see how much the twins have grown since this video was filmed!
Why is she so hyper? She makes me nervous.
Aww <3
does anyone else think her mum looks like Maggie Baird???
go gurllll
I love you
ummmm they're PAJAMAS. meant for sleeping. so why would you need pockets if all you're doing is sleeping? i swear colleen finds every excuse to call something sexist. its pajamas for crying out loud, not a pair of everyday jeans.
The 3D picture that Colleen got  I have some of those at my house
No pockets= sexist
I'm a middle girl my I have two brothers no sisters 😅
It’s to keep the wine cold
YAS POCKETS!
the funny thing is that I know someone with 39 kids while she says 3 is alot
Omg we had paper soap in the 90s I use to carry it to school and put it in my purse incase the school was out of soap or went to a public bathroom without soap
I have to remind my kids that my mom  was mine first!
I feel like the wine bottle is more for decor if you want it to be??
The volcano candle has been my moms go to scent for a few decades or at least 10 years and I loveeeeeee it
THE FAMILY PICTURE AT 3:22. EVERYONE’S GETTING SO MUCH OLDER WHAT THE HELL. I REMEMBER THE KIDS BEING SO TINY WHAT
Your babies are so cute
The wine thermos thing is for so you can travel with it discreetly or on the go It also keeps it cold if you like cold wine😊
love 3D glass photo of the baes soo adobe
What do you think the person who made the Miranda glass thing was thinking when they received the picture 😂
Colleen I would recommend the “BODY & EARTH Preserved Real Rose - Valentine Day Gifts for Her with Love You in Rose Gifts, Enchanted Real Rose with Jewelry Box Gifts for Mom Women Her Wife on Birthday, Anniversary, Wedding”. It’s more useful than plain roses in a round box!
That’s the famous Anthropologie candle, that fragrance is sooooo good😍
My dad is obsessed with candles
For that last gift, i got one for my husband for last Christmas of him and his mom! She passed away last September and he absolutely loves it, 10/10 recommend ❤
I think it’s funny when people say they have a lot of grand kids when they have like 8 and my grandparents have 32.  This is not meant to be rude.
“It smells cheap but in a cute way!” Too funny! 😂😂😂
2:36
I love colleen but I’m trying to decide how valid her ratings are seeing as how she didn’t actually use or understand the products lol
I remembered when Flynn was a tiny baby about like the age of the twins and I'm sorry if I spelled the name wrong and I know how to spell his name but I remember you were the same shirt and it just made me go back to the memories I loved the baby gadget videos they were so funny 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣💖🤗
i don't like your attitude this vid.
I wonder if the “projector” is for the 3D blocks? No idea.
Why did I think that the cheeseboard will have actual cheese in it haha
the wine bottle thing is to store wine in the fridge because if you store the glass bottle of wine in the fridge glass shards can get in your drink
Everyone explaining to her how to use the 3D light box thing, but I'm here looking for an answer for what you do with those roses?
Totally clicked on this video because I have that same Barbie shirt 👍🏻👍🏻
my mom has 9 kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The psychic told u that u would be a mom of 3 and u gave her the craziest side eye 😒 gurl 😂 😂😂 life is hilarious! So proud of ur journey sis. Hope u had a great Mother’s Day.
I’m a big fan and I didn’t know you had twinsssss cooolll
They look cute 🥰
Are both of  your babies twins
Our family has that cheese board it is amazing you will love it
Girl all love but u know better than to not only shop on but promote amazon and their products
Reaction to psychic reading the twins video 😃😃😃❤️❤️❤️
Cute babies!
That day was my birthday  I was turning 10
I have the water bottle with a straw in that galaxy pattern (same brand) and have the marble watercolor one on my wishlist. I also have a black one with silver stars and moons that is metal on the outside, not plasticy. They are my favorite favorite water bottles and I get tons of compliments on them lol. But they keep drinks SO cold all day long. it's awesome!
It's really off topic but can you ask Eric if he can do a Patrick  impression if not it fine I thought it would be funny. Frome hatters back off please
you could use like those wine bottle   for water bottles
The reason for the wine bottles is because the cork will not go back in so you can put on the lid on the wine will not go flat
it smells cheap but cute!-colleen
Fyi the vegan teacher is after you again!
im just watching this today 5/25 lol 😂 but all i can focus on is the wittle wittle babies my c section for my twins are 6/1 (boy and girl) and omg im soooooo excited they are sooooooo stinken cute
Not really to exciting, Amazon kind of disappointed this time around…i would only want the mom sweater lol everything else was useless….better luck next time Colleen 😁
Use water in it
Happy late mother's day collen!!! I hope you have a great mothers day and I love your videoes!!😊✨✨
5:52 funny you say that, because I was dreading in a country that has public bathrooms without soap. that product would have been good enough to use in those occasions.
Omg my mom actually has been wanting those vitamins, goli is supposed to be really good. It improves heart health, skin health, and even improve blood pressure and things like that or so I read. I just know it's good, even there is apple cider vinegar in vitamins too :)  Honestly that set of wine and the travel cups are awesome :P super pretty. It's helpful for trips, or even when you camp because certain places don't allow alcohol on premises lol also that 3d printing in the block is a nice idea also
Loved this but Colleen, why do you need in a pocket in bed ? haha .. I have some very comfy pants I wear that everyone tells me are PJ pants but I explain that they can't be because they have pockets & why would bed pants need a pocket ! :)
Throwback to 5 years ago when we used paper soap in school to wash our hands everytime coz for some reason the soap liquid was always empty.
Colleen your looking beautiful as always🥰
Can someone please link the cheese board?
You should have done a picture of Flynn with the babies   That would be so stinking cute
The bottle is just because of the consistency because if you want for example a picnic in the beach and you have to drive it’s safer to have it in a plastic bottle than glass and it also keeps the temperature correct because in the glass it would be boiling in two seconds
Why do PAJAMAS need pockets?! WTF are you carrying while you sleep? The soap is great if you’re somewhere with no soap like camping…how have you never seen the apple cider vinegar gummies?!
the roses last like way more than a year
Why would u need pockets on ur pjs if you’re going to sleep?
the twin is so cute
You should try stars above at target, they are cheaper, have pockets,and are SUPER SOFT.
My name is Maisy
How do you spell your baby's name the girl baby how do you spell her name
We sell those spirit wine thingys at dollar general. 10 out of 10 for chocolate milk lol
The bottle is to keep the wind cool I think
Wine bottle thing:maybe bc sum places don’t allow glass also for keepin it cool for the beach or sum idk I don’t really drink 😂
I don’t know if you’ll read this but hopefully someone does. When I became a mom I got lost in it. Everything I did revolved around being a mom, which isn’t a bad thing by any means but my identity quickly became just that. A mom. I stopped doing things I loved to do so I could spend as much time with my babies as possible and in doing that I truly lost who I was without the MOM title. I love being a mommy more then anything but that doesn’t mean it has to be the only thing I love. Keep making videos if that’s what you love! Don’t forget who YOU were before you had babies. So.. yeah. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk OK BYEEEEE❤
All I’m hearing at the end of the video is hey bear music 😂
How do you not know what Capri Blue Volcano scent is?!?!? It was notorious at Anthropologie back in 2011 and beyond!
It took me a second to recognise the paper soap thing you used! My family in India has them and I remember using them years ago when I went out on a trip with them and my mom didn't want to use the soap available there for whatever reason so instead we used the paper soaps. They're not supposed to dissolve, just create suds and then you throw them away when you're done, if I'm remembering correctly. I think you can use them for more than one person though, but the ones you used didn't seem like that was possible. Possible quality differences. But still, very cool, thought I should share!
For the wine bottle thing… It’s aluminum on the inside so the wine will stay really cold… And also since it has a cap on it you could take it to go… So if you wanted to go on a picnic date you could take your wine to go, because not all wines have a cap at the top a lot of them have a corkscrew that you can’t put back in.
Lmao I was about to exit the video then you said “oh Erik got me a gift” so I was like oh I’ll wait to see that and then you said “gotchaaa” haha made me lol
you could put water or some other flavoured drink in the bottles to keep it cold
it's smart to buy the wine bottle, beacuse then you can oxidize the wine for the wine drinkers plus it's pretty. LOVES the cheeseboard
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Everything should have pocket ❤️😍
Okay, so, Coleen … you do know that the word charcuterie refers to a presentation of meats, right? You kept using the words cheeseboard and charcuterie as though they are interchangeable. They aren’t. And when you described what you would put on the board, you never mentioned any types of meat (that I noticed, anyway), so I’m kinda thinking you got your terms confused there. I totally agree that there isn’t very much real estate for a variety of meats (or cheeses). It could be perfect for a good sized snack tray for two people, but not big enough for a party.
i feel like the wine bottle in question could be used for a mixed drink you made at home
You’re babies, you, and your entire family are so beautiful! Happy Mother’s Day! ❤️❤️
so cute<3<3
I didn’t understand if you meant it as a joke that it’s sexist that skirts and some pants don’t have pockets or if you are serious. If you are serious please explain why you think that
I saw that you have 2 babies 👶 🤧??????
I’m going to start describing myself as cheap but in a cute way. Lol
Happy mothers day
who needs pockets on pj pants?😂😂 do you put your phone in your pocket while sleeping?
I love videos like this from you
So don’t judge but I haven’t watched her in a awhile… Can anyone let me know if those babies are twins?
maurices jeans have pretty consistent pockets... soma pajamas have pockets psa
Colleeeeeeen your lips look LUCIOUS queen love you sm
are they fraternal or identical twins???
12:44 I don’t drink any alcohol either but I’m pretty sure it’s to keep it the temperature u want it
Cold wine
I testify, there is none worthy of worship except Allah and the Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Islam is the only true religion in the world. Watch Dr Zakir Naik video from Youtube. Allahu Akbar, "Allah is the greatest".
the "pot" is a dutch oven. you can also make sourdough in it
The rule is you open the wine bottle you Finnish the wine bottle
Your the best I just got off an airplane to see you on tour
The drinking or wine moms like to put their alcohol into water bottles so people don't know they're drinking in inappropriate places.
Ms. Gwen is pretty I like her smile
your babies are so cute
Are you also Maranda sing’s ?? Cuz u sound Like her
My mom literally always asks for pjs every Mother’s Day
Omg they both look like Flynn in their own little way! Maisy looks almost identical to him, but Wesley’s expressions look like him! They’re so so so cute! I love them!
The gift I got for my mom made her cry😢
I love how your voice changes for your main channel vs your vlog channel it’s kinda like a customer service voice for your main channel and then for your vlog channel it’s like what you actually sound like 😂 idk super funny to me 😂 love you sooooo much ❤
i love how the twins are always staring into the camera
It's a decoration.
I've been watching your videos for almost my whole life and your one of my role models. Your videos always make me laugh. ❤
Did you not buy the lights to go under the 3d crystal engraved pieces lol. It looks even better with the lights! I loveeee mine!
Do another baby product one
Ps. Second comment. Does anyone know where she got her shirt?
My mum loves the juice 🧃 Perfume
this is probably not gunna happen any time soon but i see colleen releasing an album
PREACH FOR THE POCKETS
Chili and like ✨chiliii✨
correct me if I’m wrong but at 10:45 that’s definitely the same music they play in Hey Bear videos right? 😆😆
I feel like vlog channel vs main channel is like the private story vs public story 🤣🤣🤣 I love it
OMG those pajamas you bought I was in Mamma Mia and are Sophie wore the exact same pair i’m gasping oh my god so cool
Did any one realize when she said it get really did get in my eye or was that just me.
Do weird twin products !
I have wasted wine like that
Yes it is because the cork doesn't fit back in the wine bottle... save the wine for later
The wine bottle thing is good for camping or a picnic so you don't have to worry about any glass breaking. Probably keeps the wine chilled too.
I've bought men's pajama bottoms with no pockets. Typically I don't care if pajamas don't have pockets.
The face Wesley made at 9:59 reminds me of Erik
All of your children literally look like mini Ericks and I'm here for it lol
Her hair looks gorgeous
The paper soap is meant for like camping so you can wash your hands with just a bottle of water  Edit: I also literally own that perfume, I bought it last year for Valentine’s Day for myself
With the 3D glass things, you can put them on a light up base and it looks so cool! :)
Loooool caught myself saying out loud “ur sister tried this before how come u don’t know what it is” as u were talking about the soap sheets
1:53 thought that popped into my head: wow Colleen and Gwen are SO stinkin pretty 💖
omg i got a 3d print thing for my birthday that came with a light to go under it and i loved it, the twins are so cute!
No pockets in women clothing IS sexiest. I read once that it comes from the fact that a hundred years or two ago, women of a certain social class did not have to carry anything, because they had always servants to open their house (so no keys), and they could just refer all their bills to their husbands...
YES with the pockets!!!! Omg yes! I love everything with pockets as a mother so handy! Dresses even better!
I’m allergic to scents so the paper soap is so nice to me. I’m always scared in public washrooms that I’m going to have a reaction to their soap. You can get unscented soap, maybe a different brand than the one toy hot!
Very millennial of her those little sayings
I dont drink but my best guess would be maybe like to keep it cold loner if youre gonna go on a picnic or something?
The wine set could he used for camping/traveling no glass bottle that can break
I love that candle scent
It doesn't have to be for wine. I would make it a water bottle.
The wine bottle is so you can take it to the beach where glass isn't allowed
Oh my god I was baffled to see the Capri Blue candle. We sell those at my work (locally, woman owned shop). They do smell great!
The big bottles can be for wine if u r taking it somewhere like the beach or a park on a date or u can also just use them as water bottles or any other liquid it’s not just for wine
You can use the bottles and cups for like water or juice or milk lol idk
Yes but also because wine needs to breath and unless you buy the wine with the top you can put on and off those bottles will come in handy.
Colleen "like doesn't every bathroom have soap?" the girls bathroom in my old high school : nope.😒
Hit eyes when you said cheeseburg
You should do etsy!!! You’ll be supporting actual small businesses and not an already billionaire! 😒😒
Prolly for travel
It is sad that you don’t have a glas photo of Finn….. If it was me i would feel outstanding
OMG 😱 you just unlocked a 15 year old memory I have with those glass 3d pictures! I don’t remember if it was high school or college they had just a kiosk of these that you could get with a friend! and I remember the person I took this picture with and got a Glasss 3-D print of! But no idea what happened to the actual object! I have to go hit her up on FB to see if she remembers!
The bottle of wine and the cups are for outdoors use like camping. That way there’s no glass to be broken! also love you!!
Your wittle babies are THEE cutest Colleen! 💘🌈✨
Because this is America and we waste time dumping things into other things for aesthetics lol
My job was to make those glass laser etched photos for a while. We would get very interesting pictures haha😆
bestie the ghetto doesnt have soap
I love that most videos Colleen always where’s that barbi top 😂😂
And to keep it cold
Case you go to the pool and they don’t allow it you can just say that it’s some juice or something
I usually am all for pockets in pants, but what do you put in your pockets while you're sleeping? LOL
it smells cheap,,, but in a good way
You hair looks SO amazing and healthy oh my gosh.
I think u are sooooo awesome and strong Tortilla talk question does Flynn understand that  Wesley and Maisy have different genders personalities and are  younger than him  I love you so much you are the best YouTuber ever you are so strong you got this ❤️❤️😘❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕u p.s Flynn Maisy Westley and Flynn are sooooooooo cute I'm sooo proud of u  u have such a beautiful family love u all , and I love how the twins talk and laugh.
There are often subway stations or park bathrooms that run out of or don't have soap so I use those paper soaps then. Actually my students sometimes give me Hello Kitty versions (I live in Japan) as presents and they are wonderful!
Wine: because it's easily resealable.
You can get a little light thing that sets under the glass objects and lights up the image.
I think the wine bottle tumblr is for saving wine like you said but, I also think it's for traveling. Like the beach or camping. So you don't have glass with you.
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD  🔥
Nice video I can't believe how fast the twins are growing!
U can put water in the bottle  To be honest I also don't understand the wine think too
IS ERIK IN THE VAMPIRE DIARIES?????
It’s for picnics. White wine will stay colder for longer. But also then you’re not transporting a breakable bottle
The first thing i thought of with the box of roses: go get 2 white wooden letter Ms from a store and make it spell MOM on a shelf
Wes is looking more like Flynn!!!
Pockets 100%!!! Full stop!!!
Find a little round cutting board and put it over the cheese utensil holding area to put more cheese on
I have now almost completely currated my wardrobe to only pieces with pockets. I have officially boycotted any clothing without them. It was not easy to find it all and I completely agree that pockets are an absolutely necessary!
On a picnic you can’t have an open container. So it makes for easy pour access and no broken laws… on a technicality lol
That volcano candle is legit my favorite smell ever! I got it for Christmas one year and became obsessed!
The wine bottle, I would use it for water tbh and it’s yo bring it to places like park
An answer for the wine bottle question. Sometimes you aren't allowed to bring glass into festivals. This could be a fancy option for bringing alcohol along. 🤔
You can get little light boxes, they’re meant to hold the crystal cube and make it look extra beautiful
Happy Mother's Day, you SSOOO deserve this. 💞💕
What site is cooking pot on
Use them for water or something else on the go
i love how open you are about putting your kids into whichever school is the best fit for them. i really struggled in public school and no one really listened to me because where i live public school is the norm. i was actually put into therapy because people thought i was just mentally ill but it was simply that public school wasn’t for me. i started online school in 7th grade and i’ve been thriving ever since.
Why should pjs have pockets? 😂
The babies are so cuuuuuuuuuuute😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Some concert venues, like the Ravinia here in Chicago, you can sit on the lawn. Bring your own picnic basket and wine. Instead of bringing a bottle and glasses, you bring that set.
I would say the big wine bottle tervis thing is for like beaches that don’t allow alcohol and you can put the whole bottle in that to be secretive. Or like you said the cork doesn’t go back in and the tervis has a lid. Or just to be low key about having wine.
The no pockets thing is annoying, but those are pj’s you sleep in them. Then you wake up and put on clothes, that either have no pockets or tiny pockets.
I have the little paper soaps and after you first get them wet you have the really quickly scrub your hands together out of the water and it will get frothy like regular soap. The in between feeling IS really slimy though 😖
So I absolutely love wine and I would love that set because in a lot of states it is illegal to have alcoholic beverages in their original container in parks were you would do picnics and stuff you have to put it in a different container so that the label for the alcohol is not being shown so for wine that would be perfect especially chilled wine that would be wonderful it would keep it nice and cold the whole time you’re there and you won’t break the law
You are not supposed to take glass to a beach, some places even have laws against drinking in public. But yes the metal would mess with the taste.
To drink wine in places it may not be acceptable to drink wine 🤫
Oh Chartruce, where we have been......l o llllll
Colleen said: young teen who is trying perfume for the first time 🌸🌹  Me and my latina self: Since I was in this earth I used perfume🤣
Grandma is def going to regift these to the grandkids 🤣
2 out of 10, but I’m going to give it to my mom 😂😂
I just had prom and my prom dress had pockets and I was so excited
Omg. Volcano candles are my very favorite. I used to carry them in our shop and they flew off the shelves. And the “throw”/scent fills a really large room. Yummy!
I just bought the Capri candle for my mom smells amazinggggg
Some wines are better if they were put in a decanter before drinking (when beeing poured the wine mixes with air and that some how is good I guess). Im no expert. Or maybe its for wines like rosé that need to be cold 🤔
Out of curiosity is mothers day a different date in America then the UK as I swear it March after my mum's birthday I'm so confused with it lol can someone tell me if possible xxxxxxx
🤣 you just make my day better i broke my foot last week and just 🤣🤣🤣
The bottle is metal so it keeps it cold so that you aren’t going back to the fridge and you can put cold water in the big bottle and go on a picnic and bring the big bottle and the two little white two little glasses and like the big bottle with the field with the water it’s like just water or like whatever
The perfume is secretly a baby waking scent
ayyyyy I’m the 1,000th comment. no one cares. I know, but it made me excited 😂hope y’all have a great week!
Try using the bottle for other liquids like water
I had the same exact thoughts about the wine bottle container 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I *THINK* it’s for like traveling or if you’re going to the beach or someplace that doesn’t allow glassware? And it’ll keep the wine chilled for longer. But besides that I think it’s a silly concept too 🤣🤷🏼‍♀️
Not all bathrooms have soap! When I was in Thailand, many bathrooms didn’t have soap and I would’ve loved those travel paper soaps
That looks like a lamp for a projector tv.. we had to replace one.
I’m a wine dinosaur and I believe that the metal casks are for keeping chilled wine chilled on an adventure? I’m in SB and we like to bring a bottle to the mission to drink in the rose garden, you know you know, and if you want a chilled white on a summer evening, a cask would keep it cool on the walk from my apt. I think.
That is a lot I childrewn
THAT CANDLE IS LIFE
Colleen you should make a updated "my family music video"
Omggg Corey needs to be in more videos with you! He makes me LmAO! When he a Dollop of Daisy I about peed my pants 🤣 MORE COREY!! Love you guys
I've missed these Amazon testing videos so bad!
Happy Mother's Day Colleen!!!!  And to Gwen also! :)
The bottle and cup are to keep the wine cold, bring it outside, etc.
Id bring the whole wine bottle to the gym filled with water xD
I CAN NOT believe you have never smelled a volcano candle…the literal best candle!
The wine bottles could be cute for picnics with water 🤷
Happy mothers day!!!  I miss the Amazon haul videos.  I honestly get so excited when I find items with pockets, so I have to agree there.  The projector looks like something you put into a TV to make the picture.  Love the cheeseboard!  Great father's day idea lol.  Not all of us are wine snobs, some of us are just happy to have wine LOL!  Wine tumblers are good to hold any kind of drink on the go, in the yard, picnicking, etc.  I too got the 3D portrait add, sent it to my mom and she was creeped out.  How do they know what your profile actually looks like??  They did end up really good so now I'm going to give it a try, why not!
Lol I can only imagine what the person was thinking who made the 3D image of Miranda.
I'm pretty sure mens pj's don't have pockets either

oh my gosh!! COLLEEN you have to put a light under the 3D printings!!!!
It is so strange to see her husband play the role of a psycho killer after seeing him mostly as the goofy guy from Haters Back Off.  He. is a good actor.
I was turning on the TV this weekend for my grandma and I put on a show and saw Eriks face! and he was like one of the murders and I was like HEY THATS ERIK! I  thought it was funny and wanted to share!
my family uses the wine tumbler cups for water at night so the cats cant stick their heads in it!
The volcano candle is my favorite and if you ever walk into an anthropology that’s the store’s signature smell
I love these types of videos haha and don't know why but please keep making them💗
it's perfect on your Miranda shelf in your office! You should get one of the RELAX logo and put that in the podcast room! :D
It also won't break
Maybe because if you go on a picnic it will keep the wine cold  especially if you freeze the bottle.
This video 🥳🥳🥳🥳
SMELL THE ROSES.  Did they have a scent?
seriously considering buying that 3d thing
to keep the wine cold lol
For the “paper soap” I recommend Grove lavender paper soap (idk what it’s called) my mom uses it I use it 10/10
The wine bottle is good if you want to take on a picnic or beach..party..etc. it will keep your white or blush wine nice and cold for you to enjoy. 🥂
#GiveMePockets 2022
also if you were using a goon bag and want to pu it in a bottol
Me need pockets!!
The “paper soap” I have them I use them for travel or in school when the soap isn’t full they are meant to be used to those who have sensitive skin it allergies
Colleen yes the no pockets is a serious problem!!! And boys wonder why we get so excited when any kind of clothes has pockets
That volcano candle you got is my mom favorite candle and its the only one that does not give her head aches. so I feel like you well love it.
i’m allergic to red dye and can’t use the pink soap that’s in most public bathrooms, so i carry the paper soaps with me everywhere so that i can still wash my hands when i’m out! they don’t compare to regular soap but they’re so convenient and better than walking around with germy hands!
When you have wines that need to be served cold you can keep it chilled with out an ice bucket! It is also great for traveling like picnics, skiing, boating, camping being our doors and not worrying about breaking glass!
I love the twins as co-hosts! So cute
Why the actual frik, why hasn’t Miranda made a single video in a month?? I NEED those Miranda Mondays!!!
Who else wants to know where season two of haters back off is
With the wine question sometimes if it is fancy wine letting it 'breathe' makes it taste nicer. Its a whole thing.
I used to have similar paper soap sheets, I Brough them with me places because I used to be mildly allergic to foam soap and I didn't like that it make my hands red and sore and itchy so I used the paper soap instead
yes
I was wearing a dress today for a party, and I released it had pockets, I was so happy and exited
Hello
Should put the 3-D glass pictures on a small changing colour light ! They would look so cool !
Colleen is me when it comes to pockets 🤣🤣
Thank you for the comments on girls clothes not having pockets. A big annoyance of mine. Hubby and I have an inside joke about not getting pockets if you have a vaheen. LOLS
Maisy has a big head they are so cute tho
Today is Mother’s Day as I am watching this so Happy Mother’s Day to you ❤️
Wonder what the 3D factory thought of Miranda🤣🤣
Happy Mother's Day!
The wine tumbler would be if you were going somewhere and didn’t want the glass bottle.
Colleen please quit promoting amazon
This is the first time I’m seeing the twins look SO different! Wes looks like Flynn’s twin!
ROBIN AIR BASE, OREGON
I have the orange juice box perfume and it's the best
Happy Mother’s Day to you and your Mama Colleen 🥰♥️☀️💜👯‍♀️
Mother’s Day? It was Mother’s Day months ago for me
To save it for later and to keep it cold if its a white whine
My family has kind of started a thing where we get the 3d blocks with the light for the spouses or mothers of our loved ones that have passed and they love them
There are no pockets to promote hand bags
Capri Blue candles are my fave! Their Volcano candle is the BEST!!!!!
Also, for when you buy a box of wine, now you can just bring a bottle of wine with you to ur plans, not a bulky box!
I always wanted that perfume
‘Musty musky’ lol🤣🤣
hey Colleen.....not every bathroom has soap :D A lot of time soap dispensers run out of soap and when I've visited other countries, they did not have soap in some bathrooms lol
Happy mothers day to all the moms reading this
Im gonna miss your videos your so funny
Happy Mothers Day, Colleen! BTW, getting stuff from Amazon that you didn’t order is a common scam. It’s called “brushing.”
Colleen's video 10/10!
You haven’t been hearing how many years are in a week so I haven’t seen you in so long ma’am
i feel like we’re best friends
I have those sheet soaps. Mine are great and get super soapy. They’re great for keeping in your car & if you’ve got a water bottle on hand, *boom* you can wash your hands on the go.
OMG COLLEEN...ive been obsessed with volcano for years. They have perfumes, soaps, etc. I’m so glad you tried it!
Colleen!,, with the 3D glass block you are meant to put a light underneath them so that the pictures light up!! :))
It's good for places where your not aloud alcohol bottles
I think the wine bottle is for places that don't allow glass bottles. For instance, an outdoor concert that you can bring food and drink but only without glass.
Colleen nobody's pajama pants have pockets... Why do you need pockets when you're going to bed?
There is also a stand for the 3d print glass the stand can light them up
What would u do without amazon
My mom got this exact board for Christmas from work and it is amazing.  We really enjoy it.
I thought you  leftist women weren’t allowed to say mother , it’s birthing person according to YOUR leaders who can’t even define a woman. The term bimbo is coming back.
I don’t drink wine either but my parents love it… it’s for when you take your wine places to keep it cold. My mom has one for by the pool/to take to the beach.
Honestly so proud of Colleen for posting this before Mother’s Day
interesting vid. *thumbs up*
With the bottles and the tumblers that you bought the bottle can be use for your going on a picnic or somewhere not even a picnic but you’re going somewhere and you don’t wanna bring a glass bottle
Love your God so that you may enter Paradise.
Good digestive
Mom
I’ve been watching your videos for sooo long and I’ve found comfort in your ‘company’ for more than half of my life 🥺 I just found out I’m having my first baby and I’m just so happy I have you and all the wonderful moms who are always commenting on your videos. I love you so much and I appreciate you 🥺🥺💗
Hi I'm a big fan
The pyjamas you bought and rated 2/10 are great! I bought a pair for my mom (exact brand and type, but different style) and she LOVES them! She just bought herself another pair last week! They’re bamboo, which means they’re incredibly soft. And yeah, no pockets, but for pjs I think it’s forgivable! 10/10 haha
Jesus loves you all❤️
Happy Mother's Day!!💐🥰
You can put literally anything in the bottles 😅 anything that need to be cold or warm for traveling oder even at home if you like 🤷🏽‍♀️
The twins are literally the cutest I love them
The bottle are probably also good for if you don’t finish the bottle and it had a cork
nobody: Maisie: *hates the cheeseboard*
well, you can decant the wine into the bottle. For those who don't know, decanting means that you pour your wine slowly into another container and avoid getting the sediment from the bottom.
but even men's pajama pants don't have pockets. you don't need them when you are in bed sleeping. hahaha
Please don't support Amazon any more :(
Funny, I have that Lodge Dutch Oven in blue from Amazon, and I make…….chili in it, that’s all 🤣 Happy Mother’s Day.
for the roses they’ll be cute on a coffee table or nightstand maybe?
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
PJs are supposed to be comfy and not utilitarian.
The wine set is to keep the wine cold and to help bring it on the go. :)
Happy Mothers  Day Colleen!
What website did you get those 3d blocks from?
Has my favorite perfume ever …is roasting it.. 😞😞😞
Capri Volcano is the #1 best smell ever.
👍❤️
Those clear block picture things are pretty cool! My sisters and I had some of mountains inside when we were young! You can buy a special little light for it to sit on and then it lights up the block! That brought back so many childhood memories! Happy Mother’s Day!
Okay but why do pajamas need pockets??
the pocket mini-rant is very justified
That's the perfume I use... I love it
We’ll for the pjs Colleen most pjs don’t have pockets so I’m that case it’s just that most of them don’t have pockets but in other cases it is just sexism
I’m so excited for these twins to grow uppppp omg
The soap strips are perfect for when you're in the car you need to quickly wash your hands, let's say you get a bite to eat and there's no bathroom nearby. It's only nice if the soap smells good LOL. Personally I own these because they're perfect for the car
You on trending good job
Other then traveling I don’t see why I would but my wine bottle in that thing MAYBE…… a wine that is a little more fizzy and tastesb better chilled because it does go flat in the bottle and in the fridge BUT because I know that I normall drink the bottle no later then 2 days of opening

Happy mothers day to everyone that has a mom.
It makes the wine colder
The 3D gifts are so cool and unique I love it
So the wine can stay chilled and be closed, or taken where a wine bottle may be prohibited. They’re actually very handy! But could also be used for drinks you just want to keep cold (:
I love you
Love this type of video ❤️
"At least it's a famous anus" my husband upon watching this. Happy Mothers Day, Colleen!
I’m just thinking of whatever person received the order to make Miranda’s face in 3D🤣🤣
This is so cute and adorable
Did anybody else notice that she is wearing the same shirt she did whenever she did this with Flynn
A bottle could be easier stored and to carry around rather than boxed wine. You could fill the bottle with boxed wine 🍷 💃
That one thing is a projector bulb replacement
I don't drink either and don't understand the wine bottles. They also look hard to clean.
The reason for the soap despenser thingy is when  your on the go and there is no soap in like a public bathroom or something
i know this isn't your vlog channel but tortilla talk question!!! when are you reacting to when terry predicted about the twins???
Mother trucker! Happy Mother's Day, kiddo. Peace and Love.
Whats the link to the 3d photo block?
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Happy mothers day to you, Jessica, & to your Mom!!!! We love you guys!!!!
I have too many kids. 😩 same
Those volcano candles are bomb😍😍
I have that cheese board in my Amazon wishlist! 😂 I’m excited to see your thoughts on it!
Happy Mother’s Day, Colleen!!! Have a wonderful weekend
Yo the glass is actually cool
We can make you 3-d prints. ( I kinda want to do it for you as a gift)
15:01 i got so scared i thought a ghost was there but no.. turns out it was just cardboard-miranda
Capri Blue candles are sold at anthropologie they are usually bougie type of candles that you bought
Oklahoma would be a great place to tour. I traveled there recently and Pops has awesome drinks with good and weird flavors. My personal favorite is cotton candy.
women do need pockets cause whenever i do have pockets i am so surprised and happy
You can buy a corck
I think so it’s not in a glass bottle it’s really pretty
ok but is the little “projector thing” not the light for the 3D photo cubes??? i thought that was gonna be all the comments but no ones said it they just keep recommending you buy one🥲🤣
Please give the Miranda one to Angela for Mother’s Day 😂😂
the bottle are good for like taking wine the lake where glass is prohibited. I dont drink wine so if it was mine, I would put my pink whitney vodka in it😂
Happy Mother’s Day Colleen
I always like my white wine cold! If I bring it to a barbecue, there isn’t always room in the cooler for a bigger bottle so that’s awesome! 🤷‍♀️🙌
I love those candles
Happy Mothers Day Colleen!🦋 Hope you and your mom have a wonderful Mother’s Day!🌸🫶🏼
Colleen u better keep that mom mode sweater! You know that womans not gonna wear it! It's too short like u said.
Travel wine
I swear if Amazon doesn’t sponsor Colleen soon…. We’re gonna start a riot🤣 Love these videos!
For the wine tumblers, maybe it’s to keep it cold.😂🫣😅
FYI Amazon recommendations are based on algorithms they build from your purchases and browsing history
The wine bottles are great for on the go. Picnics, beach, pool, whatever. It’ll keep the wine cold while out and about. The stainless steel is also great for the pool and other places that don’t allow glass. Lastly, sometimes I only buy box wines and I may use it to take some wine over a gf’s house or anywhere else.
there’s no pockets in Woman’s pants because it keeps purses in use
It's for traveling purposes. You can bring wine to a picnic, beach, pool.. etc. The metal keeps it's cold and won't break :) I love my set - I use the cups all the time
It also keeps it cold longer
!
Why would someone need pyjama bottoms with pockets? 🤔
I’d use that bottle for lemonade or something that I want to take out and keep cold! 😁
What I do when I don’t have pockets on my pyjama pants is I place my phone at the elastic and pull my pyjamas over my phone then flip my phone(if that makes sense)it’s actually really secure!
Talking a mile a minute!!!! 😅
Hahahhaha  "It might go up on Christimas" I feel your pain 😂 new mom here. My sweets is 4 months today! Yay!
Instead of wine, you could just put water in them!
Musty = a damp almost mouldy smell Musky = a perfume ingredient that disturbingly is, seriously, scrapings from a male deer's reproductive organ 🤮
We have a store in our mall that does those 3D pictures! My mom has wanted one of my siblings and I for sooo long. It's actually a really good gift!
Maybe the bottle is white wine and it is to keep it cold.
Also it is good if you wanna serve a homemade wine and you packaged it in big plastic bottles or something not so presentable. So it's very good for that.
Your hair looks beautiful.
It's to take refrigerated wine to a location with no fridge. I don't have one personally because I mostly drink red.
Ya goofball, there are no pockets in pajamas cuz you sleep in pajamas and you don't want lumps in your pants! FYI when you're trying to figure out what the two piece is called, that is actually the definition of pajamas. They're called pajamas.
I bought some of those soaps but bought it for camping.
I think you are supposed to take the utensils out of the cheese board and use that space for cheese as well. Because you can stick the utensils into the items that you use them for. At least that’s how I would use it lmao
You made me freak out saying happy Mother’s Day when it wasn’t Mother’s Day queen. I had a heart attack
Woahhhh the 3D glass pictures were very cool
lol
Goli apple cider vinegar gummies are very popular. There's several videos on YouTube about it.
Not only should there be pockets but they need to actually be functional!! They are never big enough. Heck idc if you got make everything cargo pants/shorts. Give me ALL the pockets!!
I like how you said trying to force me to by
omg i love your hoodie! i found it on the target website months ago and didn't buy it at the time but i WISH i had because i love it and i cant find it anywhere! it looks great on you!
little Wesley is totally putting a Coleen here7:18
Your mom is going to love her mother day gift
Some people are very germ kinda ways maybe
You should try to put the candle under there Cute little button noses to see what they might do smelling something different I have done it to my oldest daughter and my boy/girl twins it’s cute to see what they do lol just fun stuff to do with the kids for a variety of different new things like and do ect lol sending love from Massachusetts 💜
This video sucked.....................
Put the roses in Erik's bathroom he made 🤣🤣
Colleen: Oh no! The babies are awake! Also Colleen: * opera sings the life out of her* 😂😂
I love Colleen but why does she continue to support amazon and give them so much business 😩
Not sure if it has been mentioned, but there are bases for those glass pictures. You can have multiple colors going or just one. Really makes the portrait pop!!! Some really neat gift ideas!!!
The metal bottles could be used for just cold drinks with ice for picnics or sitting near the pool because it's metal not glass
That looks like a bulb for the projector of an interactive whiteboard. I ordered one recently from amazon and it got lost. I wonder did you get mine 🤔
can anyone link the 3d thing? 😄
With the 3d print thing I feel bad for Flynn cause you got one of the twins but not one for Flynn
It’s supposed to keep your wine chilled longer.  While having it chilled
I think the paper soap is for camping or beach trips or if you go to a park of some sort and can’t make it to a restroom you use a bottle of water and the paper soap
The bottles could be used for wine coolers. Rachel did the soap things a few years ago. I wonder what the laser printer thought about Miranda?
Omg COLLEEN my dad is OBSESSED with the Volcano candle. You can get them in a bunch of different packaging/casing too. My dad doesn’t even burn them because he doesn’t want to waste the smell 😂 they have that scent in lotions and room sprays and stuff too!
my 1st time seeing the bbs i havent kept up to date and I LOVE THEMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM SO CUTE I JUST WANT TO SQUISH THEM awwwwwwwwwwwww
Okay the thing about the to go wine bottle is to keep it a certain temperature I think it's more temperature controlled take for picnics with your husband with the matching cups.
I love that Dutch oven and own several!!
paper soaps are very popular in asia in the past, idk ppl just don't talk about them or sell them in physical stores anymore
I like this voice than your very old voice
When there are pockets they are too shallow and stuff falls out!
"A mother of THREE children, holy crap, that's A LOT! Exaggerate, much? The Duggers have NINETEEN children; that's a lot. 3 is the amount of children the average family has. She's so ridiculously dramatic.  Why are those kid's heads so frikken huge?😳 They literally have adult size heads on baby bodies.
Wine bottle corks do fit back onto the bottles turn them upside down...
Didn't even show his reaction?! Ugh lame
Lazor gifts are great
I am gonna buy the wine set to make cold brew in inside my fridge. I definitely drink enough coffee to just constantly have a daily bottle full lol.
The bottles are very popular in australia because it keeps your wine cool on a picnic or something and if you going somewhere where your not allowed alcohol we always put it in these and use them like that 😂 doesn’t affect the taste
You can use the wine thingy as a water bottle 🤷🏼‍♀️
I LOVE THE VOLCANO CANDLE IT SMELLS SO FREAKING GOOD!!
pouring wine in another bottle also airrates the wine, so more flavours will come out of it.
Colleen your sister Rachel had the soap papers on her channel. 🧼 Capri Blue Volcano scent is the best in candles!! I love it!!
and i love your vid
and btw my birthday is on may 17
The twins are so cute.you make my day you are amazing.
Please please please read my comment, Colleen! I just really want to know your thoughts on buying on Amazon instead of independent smaller stores that I am sure have super fun and unique products as well? I just think we shouldn't feed anything into Amazon and should support smaller shops, and I thought you would feel that way too...:/
Tommorow is mother's day in South africa
Please redo the "my family" clip now that you're a mom of three !!!
Very very late
Your an awesome Youtuber..dont stop....
I so wish you would show Him the Miranda one on the podcast!!!
Hi congratulations
Yeah
Genuinely terrified of the Miranda 3D Glass thing😂
your frantic
The box of roses can be place on top of stacked fancy books on a coffee table or side table. Happy Mothers day Colleen from a mother to a mother much love <3
I’d say the wine kit would be great for going to the beach or having a picnic or something like that. Less chance of breakage and if you don’t finish it, you can close it.
Colleen I hope you have an amazing Mother’s Day I think your one of the best fun and prettiest mom I’ve ever seen. You remind me of my mom a lot. I love that if your doing anything and Flynn wants to talk you just act fulling engaged and you don’t even act like your not listening and I love that you take your time with the kids. Also loveeee you clothes unpacking little parts of the videosss ❤️
7:13 They're throwing their voices into Colleen! (͡๏̯͡๏) Baby Ventriloquist's! ٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶
Love paper soap if using public loo and no soap or allergies it’s great, mine are from’soap and Hope’ small buy from uk. The lady who’s company went though post partum depression and making soap was therapy.
No offense meant at all whatsoever but what is Erik doing while you are working that he can’t take care of the kids, I really don’t want to come off rude but it’s frustrating when you are doing so much and it seems like he isn’t helping you. Maybe I’m wrong and he also is working or something, but if that’s not the case then maybe you could set some working hours and Erik can help you. Maybe you don’t want that and that’s okay too and it’s none of my business really, lots of love to you all 🥰
OHMYGOSH. You can totally see the similarities with the twins so much when they are sitting on your lap side by side!
Love your vids Colleen!!
Totally felt the crazy busy mom vibe. ❤️ I would have been 6 months pregnant with triplets next week but had a unfortunate miscarriage in January that quite literally almost killed me. 😅 I’m still processing everything as a LOT has been going on since that kept me from fully processing and grieving what happened. Still not giving up on having more babies tho! Hubs has been my rock through everything ❤️ it’s kinda weird to think I would have had 4 kids…I freaked out when we first heard triplets but now? I really wouldn’t mind it. Ya it’d be complete poo n vomit ridden insanity but…I don’t think about the exhaustion or bad things anymore jus that I really want more kids because watching them grow, learn and getting to love on em that’s all I want. I want my oldest to have that sibling bond like I do with all 12 of mine. The inseparable bond that no matter how much we fight, argue or tease each other, if one of needs something or are in trouble we all come running together. Because we have each other’s backs. That’s what I want for my children. That deep unbreakable love n bond between siblings
The wine bottles because it’s a flask it keeps the drink hot or cold but it was just a normal wine bottle it would probably go hot and it’s also good for travelling and like you said it’s good because the it has a lid instead of a cork
Omg you NEED to get the light that goes underneath the 3D photo things!!!!!!! Thats the best part!!!!!I Really shows off the 3D effect.
My bf is a streamer and likes those apple cider vinegar pills! He said it has made him more energized after the first week of taking!
wesley really looks like flynn when he was a baby, they could be twins!
It’s mostly just to take your wine out to an event or picnic to keep it cold or whatever temperature you prefer. But you could fill it with juice or whatever for park trips or picnics instead if you’d rather. Since the glass/plastic bottles they already come in don’t keep them cold.
Okay so like I love you and your videos…but when you rush through and say things like “I’d rather be with my kids” it makes me feel like I’m bothering you and feels like you don’t enjoy it anymore. Obviously your kids are more important but I miss the friendship vibe that came with your videos :(
I love these videos:)
the cheeseboard is nice and the bottles and cups and those 3d sculptures are cool
they make these light up trays that you places glass laser photo things on that help light it up so you can see it better and then kind of makes it like a statement piece very cute my grandma has way too many 😂
I love the 3D pic of the twins!!! Miranda’s as well!
I do not drink at all but my guess that the wine tumblers are so you can pour/fill it with wine and take it on the go like to the beach or where ever and be discreet! It’s wine to go😂
HAPPY FIRST MOTHER’s DAY AS A MOM OF 3 🥰
The Capri Blue Volcano candles are my absolute favorite candle IN THE WHOLE WORLD, I’m so excited that you have it in your life now!!
Keeps wine colder for a longer time. I use the simple modern cups and I loooove them!! Keeps my ice frozen the whole day!!
🙂🙂🙂
Does anyone else have a hard time telling the twins apart, or is that a me problem?
“Oh no! The babies are awake.” (insert crazy vibrato lament) <— This took me smooth out 🤣
Oooo that lipstick color looks really nice on you. Really like it!
But like what do you need pockets in bed for
The soap is for travel. Pop it in your purse and you will always have good old soap and water. They are amazing. Too bad it didn't smell good.
I forget that Colleen and Rachel are sisters, do not see the resemblance then she burps and all I see is Rachel. I will forget again in an hour.
I NEED THE LINK TO THE 3D PICTURES!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
Keeps the wine cold. But you don't have to put wine in it. You could use sparkling juices, to make it look fancy....
go to 18:42 its the best
The aluminum would help it stay cold if you go out :)
Lol my family got one of those 3D crystal things done on a family trip when I was 10. We still have it lol. It cost like 200$ to get done tho, but we got it done at the top of a mountain in Banff.
its stressing me out that wes has puke on his mouth
💜💜💜💜💜💜
I’m totally getting my husband a 3D photo for our anniversary!! 😂😂
PEASE. COME TO PHOENIX
I looovve my simple modern stuff! Good quality for much cheaper than other brands
A LOTTA CHILDREN A LOTTA CHILDREN MY MOM HAD 5KIDS
Lol always pimping out your kids for views 🤣🤣
The dark blue version of the candle I highly recommend!! It seems soo much better!! 1 of the top requested presents!!
Okay I love the soap idea cause my highschool never had soap in the bathrooms. My sister works there now and still has the problem of no soap. Which is weird because you would think all throughout Covid they would try to have more soap but no. I guess that is what happens when you live in a title 1 area.
hi hope the twins strart carwling so and hope the twins start to walk soon
We love cooking chili......and chili🤣🤣
Capri blue volcano is the best scent ever!!!
The bottles are lent for travel. When you are worried about broken glass. Supposed to keep your wine cold too. You could use it for juice for the kids too
My dad had one of those 3D cubes made for my son of him playing baseball and it came with a base that lights up. Way cool.
bruh she said chili and......chili😂😂😂😂im laughing so hard rn
Does anyone realize how she's wearing the same top she wore when she was testing baby products for Flynn????!!!!!
The bottle might keep the wine cholled
I honestly don’t understand why you have your husband home and Cory and don’t ask for help while you’re filming… this is really hard to watch…
On the cheeseboard debate: 🧀 With the cheeseboard open, I'd place the dishes in the cavity where it swings open. Keeps the top half open, and give more room for meats and cheese! Also could use a piece of fabric over the utensil area and fill it that way. You're allowed to feel a little bougie! 🤭
If you want to see the 3D better put light under it to go through.
wait colleen dont be like those people. you cant say a brand is sexist because their pjs doesnt have pockets. Im a guy and i wear pjs as much as possible and my pjs doesnt have pockets. so colleen calm down. those are serious accusations.
its mothers day in australia tomorrow!! happy mothers day colleen!
Colleen makes me so happy
I can just imagine the person who had to screen print the Miranda photo in 3d just being weirded out lol
no one else could get the babies while you were filming a video?
Wesley and Maisy are the cutest babies ever
I’m laughing at the idea of that company making the Miranda 3D cube and probably being weirded out by it 😂
Maisy is a baby Colleen and Wes definitely looks just like Flynn!
I hope you have a wonderful Mother's Day, Colleen!
You put cheese spread in the dishes.
Is the projector thing for your projecter for your shows?   Cuz I thought you said u had projector malfunctions
3:30
Didn't like the roses
That glass figure, I have that it’s a picture of my great grandma.
i agree women need pockets in pants
I love the picture things! I've seen them on Tik Tok and I think they're soooo cool!
Aaagajdhdn The babieees😭😭❣️❣️❣️❣️
In ireland mothers day is in march
Volcano candles are my FAVORITE! I’m obsessed with that scent! 💓
Oh my gosh Nikki limo loves those rose boxes, she leaves them around her house and says they smell good!
happy mothers day 💓 💗
“Men” PJs always have pockets so it’s weird to me that “womens” PJs don’t come with it! I knew jeans usually did it but they can’t even put them in pajamas?!
The wine bottle keeps wine insulated while outside!! Mainly for picnics, beach trips, etc. (also disguises the wine so no one knows it's wine ;) )
Have a hugely happy well-earned Mother's Day!!
it's for mixers or places you can have glass bottles at
Colleen you’re always making videos. I love your vlogs. You’re amazing
Omg when is Colleen's babys gona have brown eyezzzzz
Those dutch ovens make the BEST bread. Look up dutch oven bread and i promise you will not be disappointed
You were washing your hands wrong I do it sometimes
Wine bottle prob for being discreet/travel/ not having glass in certain places (pools/beach)
I've literally seen these juice box perfumes in the store. They have different ones. I even insta-storied them cause I thought they looked fun.
Use them for sangria
Cute stuff!!  Great job!
The little soap packs are really nice to have in the car for when we are at the ball fields… they do not always have soap-especially by late afternoon games…maybe keep them in your diaper bag.☺️
Period
Picnics
“It was very recommended to me” 😂Also Is it me or is she really different on this channel versus the other channel she seems a lot more up and happy
BRUH THATS LIZZO"S PERFUME COLLEEN YOU QWEEN
"Is that a great idea?"  Sounded just like flynn! Love from ct
It's to keep the wine cold! A lot of people like white wines chilled and if you're taking a bottle on the go for a picnic or something, this keeps it cold like an insulated water bottle :)
Happy mothers day
the volcano candle is my moms favorite! we have at least 10 of them in our house!
Have a wonderful Mother’s Day Colleen!  ❤️💞
Duluth trading co, clothing store has the best women's clothes, pockets in almost everything, shirts included, pj pants, leggings, etc. And great quality
Social credit scores system CHINA way of money
Honestly the wine bottles in my opinion are more for aesthetic than anything else. But maybe I'm wrong. I could see a younger (21 to 30) wine drinker using these.
I’ve been screaming about pockets for years.
Of course she said Christmas her favorite holiday

That Miranda 3D block 😂
You could use the books for water upstairs to refill your cups or when you go on picnics or to the park to carry more drinks with you!! I loved the 3d things they where both great in their own way lol!! Happy Mother’s Day!!
was hoping to catch eriks reaction to the miranda block 🤣 also. the wine bottles could be for cold water. that was my first thought because i don't drink either.
me, not a mom, with a mom that doesn’t fall into any of the categories that amazon is promoting: hmm, let me spend hours browsing through all of these to see what to buy 🤔🤔🤔  i saw a thing on pinterest where someone glued a mirror to that (or a similar) cheeseboard and used it as a secret cabinet that looks like decor. it was pretty cool honestly lol
My story ? I don't tell  he ?  He and woman get wedding enegment ring!    Milo Ventimiglia  and myself story?
If women's bottoms with pockets sold better than bottoms without, they'd be made more often with pockets.  Companies exist to make the most money that they can.  They don't exist to keep women pocketless.  Your issue is with other women.  Get them to buy more bottoms with pockets then that's what you will see in stores.
the bottles are for picnics for chilled drinks
Wine thing: can save for later bc no cork, also, can drink in public ? 🤷🏼‍♀️ idk
My dads gf uses those gummies!! They’re great for digestion
Put the roses in the pink bathroom Eric designed downstairs 😂
Yes, def need pockets that are functional too!! <3
Get a wine reusable cork
I got one of those 3D photos for my mom. It was a photo of one of her kitties that has since gone to kitty heaven.
you should recreate the “my family”music video now that u have the twins or maybe when they are a bit older
The 3d things are awesome I have a few, and you can buy bases for them that have colourful led lights that make the image stand out !
Happy Mother's Day Colleen. All the Ballinger Mother's. Enjoy the Day! Mikalyn Daugherty WPB FLORIDA
You can get a light stand for the 3d blocks that make it much easier to see the image :)
Omg those poor kids, this stresses me out with the babies
Did she just call the Dutch oven a "pot" lol 🤣🤣🤣
That soap = yuck!
How did you order without knowing what they are? How is that even possible. And no not all bathrooms have soap. That's the whole point
You could always use it if you drink box wine.  I don't like box wine but,  some people do.
you can afford to buy from anywhere else that is likely to be more ethical, better for the environment, and not exploiting workers. what is the point of a massive haul of things you're never going to use nor care about?
girl why are you buying from amazon--
Lol I’ve gotten those tumblers and I use them for water lol!! Fancy girl water lol
Is it me or does she seem picky 🤔
Lol the way Maisy looked at Westley when she said cheese board
Thank you so much for the video it made my day better
Colleen you should do trying weird baby products from Amazon again but twin addition!🤠
The 3D portrait of the babies is adorable; the one of Miranda is terrifying. XD
My aunt has 2 identicle twin girls and 2 identcle boys
I think the soap thing is to carry around just in case a public bathroom doesn’t have soap.
Every time you touch your hair, I think of that crazy woman at cvs screaming at you not to do it😂
Where’s the 3d glass thing from??
You should have your kids decorate the outside box of the roses then make it a gift for your mom or for you. That way the kids have an activity to do and you get to keep the box with roses for memories and it won’t feel like the box is taking up to much space.
The twins are 6 months old time flies feels like just a few weeks ago you uploaded the video
Lol…love the 3D pics. You just need to get the little lighted stands they make for them. They shine light thru the cubes and turn at the same time!
I am only 8
It's true tho, the reason why most woman pants/bottoms don't have pockets is because back a long time ago, woman would were big skirts with multiple layers and they'd use the layers as pockets for money or other stuff and at one moment, some women used it to hide weapons and since then women were basically not allowed to wear skirts, they had to wear pants without pockets and for some reason pockets weren't fully added back to woman pants even today...so you're right when you say it's sexist to not put pockets 🤷🏼‍♀️ idk if you knew it but we learn something new everyday
💜💜💜💜💜
Who the Fuxk needs pockets in pjs
The wine bottle is like for a trip to the pool or something. Although you're right; I do think the aluminum changes the taste of alcohol!
For those who don't know about the present erik got her, HE MADE A TEEN CHOICE AWARD
“Pajama suit thing, I don’t know what you’d call it.” Lol literally just pajamas/ pajama set. Those are THE classic pajamas.  She’s such an oblivious person. Even about the smallest things. 🤣🤣🤣
Colleen has forgotten that glass wine bottles break?? A broken wine bottle _will_ ruin your picnic, while out hiking. 💕
It’s so funny to me that my dress has pockets
So you can bring wine to the pool or beach where glass isn’t allowed
You could use the bottles and tumbler for any drinks so that they would stay cold if you put it out somewhere or took it to a picnic
why would you need pockets when you go to sleep haha you do you girl
Coleen doesn’t know how to wash her hands properly
The wine bottles are prob used in place of a glass bottle plus those are designed to keep it cold, honestly you could put anything in them I suppose even hot things like coffee??
the wine bottle could be useful to people that make their own wine !! usually in that case it’s stored in glass jugs
Their heads so literally so square 😂
Can you please post more Miranda sings videos
Same here colleen literally I don't wear half of my closet because their is no pockets
I have those pajamas!!! I love them they're so comfortable!
I agree x
love pockets xxxxxxx
I love the layered 3d picture of the twins! I think that is an awesome Mother’s Day gift!
Omg omg can you please do another wedding dress video with different dresses I know there's so many and they've created more since you did that video I would definitely watch it please like this comment if you agree
Go watch jules and saud  they say what to  do  with the  roses 🌹
Maisy: mom why is there an arm going up and down in my face
I bought that exact charcuterie board off Amazon. It's nice,  but I never use the utensils & the swivel makes it harder to carry & wastes space you could otherwise use.
I’m only 15 but I think the wine bottle thing is for making your own  Like once u make it u keep it in the bottle
Pls video giving her all these gifts lol
I’m laughing so hard with the babies there i love them lol they r so cute. I love when u talk to us and ur holding them cus I love their faces when u talk to us😂
And here we go again we all know this girl will never ever say anything good about anything or give a good review she will always be negative about everything
Nauseating relentless & unnecessary jump cuts.....
To pour past sediments, usually older bottles are DECANTED before pouring into your wine glass. 😜
It’s Not Mother’s Day though so
Probably to store boxed wine in a nicer way to house or take around to a party or gathering or evening out.
Yes, pockets! And you can put water in the bottle and keep it next to your bed.
"I have 3 kids omg that's a lot"  Mind you your brother has 6 😂😆
I love you so much colleen. You make me so happy your the best
Love your shirt! I do wonder how you got that projector thing.
Omg the pj pants have no pockets because that makes them more expensive. It has nothing to do with being sexist.
Maisy looks so much like flynn in this video
I put my coffee in those little cups and people always ask me why I have my coffee in a wine Tumblr
10:31 Epic!!
Please help me understand why she would say that just because  something doesn't have pockets is sextist.
The volcano candle is the best. I worked in retail for years and it was hard to keep in stock.
Disappointed in Corey for the lack of a “recommended” counter 😂
Happy Mother's Day, Colleen! Your kids are lucky to have such an incredible mother!
“The 3D glass was kind of expensive” …. says the woman who spent $35 on a singular candle 🤣❤️
You put the wine in the bottle to keep cold while going on a picnic or outside porch for a meal...etc
I was just on amazon’s mom gifts and then came here and saw u did reviews!!! Perfect timing😍😍😍😍
Wes is starting to look so much like Flynn!
Lol 😂 Colleen I alive the fact that you got a Miranda 3D glass picture!! Also the twins looked so precious in their 3D glass picture- you can buy a stand for them that has a light source to make it easier to see at all times of the day!! Happy Mother’s Day!!
The wine bottle and cups would be nice for taking wine camping or something where you don't want to deal with glass maybe getting broken. Like I've been to beaches where they don't allow glass for that kind of reason.
If you have a wine the needs to be chill that is good for it to keep it cold.
the miranda in the window at 5:45 literally scared me 😂
The medal wine bottle is. To keep it cold if you keep it in the normal bottle it won’t stay cold if it’s not in a fridge or a ice chest
Girl why don’t you know how to wash your hands?! lol
did anybody notice that when she got the photos she didn't get one of flyn
I take those same apple cider vinegar gummies everyday
holy crap! I only got away for a while and now she has 3 kids and first baby is already so big wtf!😱😱
Happy Mother's Day, Colleen! Hope you have a nice weekend, thank you for making a crazy week brighter sharing your vlogs and your product review!
The soap is for on the go, or if your camping.
Aren't those bottles supposed to keep things cold? I would think it's for white wine to keep it chilled if bringing it to a party, the beach, etc!
Refile
Happy Mother’s Day! I loved these reviews! I’m excited to see you and your mom in the matching pjs, except with clothes under the sheerness!
when colleen said “this is niceeee” all i could think was “gorllllll” … anyone else? 🤣🤣
The soap is a one time use to help kids learn how long to wash their hands or to take on the go like when at public restrooms and it takes about 20-40 seconds for the soap to wash off I think. I saw a TikTok of the person how makes it explain it. They also said there are different scents I think but don’t quote me on that. LoL. Hope that helps.
I love you so much queen. You are the sweetest kindest most caring amazing talented human ever. I could never thank you enough for all you have done for me in my life. You are the best mom ever to the sweetest cutest toddler ever with the biggest personality and to Wesley & Maisy. Erik is so loving supportive and encouraging. You are the most beautiful person inside and out. You have benefited my life in so many ways and have had such a positive impact on me. Thank you for making me smile daily and bring joy to my world. I truly don’t know the person I would be without you. I’m so proud of you and all you have accomplished in your life. There are no words to describe how much you mean to me and how amazing you are. Thank you for being the sunshine in mine and so many others life. Thank you for getting me through tough times and making me so happy. Love you to the moon 🌙 and back. 💜💕❤️💙🌻🍪💛🌵🐢🚗
Love your family
Omg I'm cracking up at colleen 'Washing' her hands lol!
I work at a winery. Sometimes the wine needs to aerate the bottle helps with that. It's like a decanter.
Omg! I'm sooooo stoked for this!
The projector light could be for your projector in the podcast room that Erik ordered.
Or what about the wine that comes in wine boxes maybe so you don’t carry the whole box you can just pour some there and take it where your going idk lol that’s my guess on the🍷 😂
When you said “it smells cheap in a good way” I laughed so hard 🤣🤣🤣
I love these videos!! Lol I’m pretty sure I’ve bought things you had in videos
Hi Colleen!  The roses are pretty; the twins are so cute.  I like the pot so much; I love a cheese board; that's the coolest of the 3D photo; hugs.
COLLEEN!!! For the 3D photo blocks you have to get the light thing that you set the photo block on and it's so awesome! I love those and the light under makes them look even better!!! Can't wait to see the one you get made of the babies and Flynn!!
(mothers day products)” i think eric will really love it!”
That's a projector bulb.
i was watching friends, and miranda reminds me of janice....lol
So you don’t bring glass! And it helps it stay chilled
cheaper clothes often don't have pockets and also sometimes women's clothes aren't flattering with pockets.
Amazon is the worst. We shouldn't be supporting them. Please stop doing these videos. And watch the documentaries on how Amazon treat their staff...
Colleen: I don't know if this is going up before mother's day. ME: it is!
When you pour a bottle of wine or port from one bottle to another (decant), it helps it breathe and improves the taste of particularly red wine.
You look so much like Meghan markle
I LOVE Capri blue candle scent. I get them from Anthropologie.
The metal wine bottle keeps the wine insulated for like picnics and stuff. So if it's a cold wine, pour it in the bottle cold, and it'll stay cold. If you need room temp wine, pour it in room temp and it'll stay room temp. And then you also don't have to deal with traveling with glass.
This was hilarious 😂 Happy Mother’s Day 💐
Also about the pockets; historically women had bigger pockets!
Hey Colleen I love you so much. And love watching you and your family. 😀
The 3D glass thingny, put a light under it! It looks awesome! :)
I bought my mum one of those wine coolers for Christmas. Ideally it’s to keep cold wine cold. We go camping a lot So I bought it for her to keep in the camper. She has never used the cooler for wine though, just a s a drink bottle 😂 The cups are cool though
the roses are just for decor and smell
Most people have daycare or babysitters or a nanny for when they work. I admire you and get you. When my kids were little my spouse and I worked different shifts so one of us were always with the kids. Love YOU!
Colleen you are so funny I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
As a wino, yes it would ruin the flavor. I jam that cork back in the bottle idc and if I bring wine anywhere with me it gets opened when I’m ready for it and finished lol
I hope you have a happy Mother's Day Your Children Are So Beautiful
I miss your Amazon testing on your channel
All those would have got me too 💕
Amen!!!!!! Preach!!!!! girl pockets are everything and they are NOT in WOMENS clothes love you content and you 🥰
clothing companies should start giving "men" clothes no pockets to show them how we feel
Can you link the 3d thing? That is so cool I want to get my stepmom that!
I love all ur videos no matter what u do I just love listening to u talk lol
I have that exact charcuterie board and I absolutely LOVE it!!!! 10/10
The wine bottle will probably keep your wine cold for travel purposes and it won’t break in a bag like a glass bottle would.
Colleen I know you say the twins look radically different but they literally look exactly alike
Colleen, I just ordered a bridesmaids dress and IT HAS POCKETS! It was a complete surprise and i am delighted. Sexism at its finest without them.
Your hair has grown so long it’s beautiful
You talked about how women not having pockets is sexist. I learned in my fashion apparel and design class, that a lot of the time “women’s” clothes are made with lighter fabrics so that they buy more to stay warm.
Hiiiiii
The 3D is so cute!!!
Colleen. the video was going fine until u left a spot of puke on ur arm in was gagging for the rest of the video and i cant unsee it in my head
Colleen!! You should get an LED light base for for the 3D glass things! You like set the glass on top of the display stand and turn on the light and when it shines through the glass it’s pretty cool through the like 3D faces! I think they’re called like LED light pedestals or LED light bases?
Am I the only one who thinks the "wine bottle" doesn't have to be used for wine? Lol I'd put some ice cold water, juice, etc in there for a beach day/picnic
Yass the Amazon videos are back
my grandma had one of thoe glass picure things and it sat on light making it super easy to see!
i have those bottles.. the point is like say, a picnic..or going on a boat etc.. You want the white wine or whatever to stay cold.. Its a thermos basically
The Goli gummies are delish!
Real pockets and full pockets please none of this pocket flaps that are sewn shut nonsense and no like Chapstick pocket that even if you put a Chapstick in there it’s gonna get stuck and you’ll never see it again pocket
I think those bottles would be good for water or juice; maybe during travelling or on your nightstand in your bedroom when you're thirsty at night?
drinking game: every time Colleen says “it was recommended to me” drink! 😆😆😆
Maisy looked absolutely OFFENDED and APPALLED by the cheese board 😂
You and your videos are the best!!!
I wouldn’t use those tumblers for wine either. I also don’t drink alcohol cause lucky me I’m allergic to now. But I would use them for water, juice or something like that.
I love these videos!!! Thanks for making this!
Yay we are back with the Amazon testing video!!! Love it!❤️
Try dutch oven bread, soo yummy!
Capri blue Volcano is the best!!
Love your videos you are such a good mom
Elon Musky
love these videos
The bottle will keep the wine cold or even like a warm cider warm
🫧
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY COLLEEN <3 <3 <3
This is off topic. But call the midwife did an episode about Symphysis pubis dysfunction. It made me think of Colleen. Not enough people know about that condition. So if you have a chance you should watch it.
Volcano scent is THE BEST
"She's my mom" no colleen, she's OUR mom
The wine bottle is to keep all of your wine cold in you are bringing it somewhere like the beach or park or something! If you bring just a regular wine bottle, the wine gets warm ☹️
14:00 👀 COLLLLEEEEEN Don't even joke about it it's to early 😅🤣🤣🤣
Im pretty sure the cheese can go where the knives are if you take them off of the cheese board!
babe, you ARE Miranda in 3D.😂
this kinda felt more like a vlog channel video and i dug that!
Is smells cheap but In a good way - colleen ballinger 2022
Definitely a shopping addiction. You need help.
Happy early Mother’s Day!!! Hope you have a great Mother’s Day. Love your videos so much! That 3D picture of the twins is adorable. Love you so much Colleen!!!❤️❤️❤️
Capri blue Volcano is like the most viral candle scent of all time! 😂 I love it too!! Happy Mother’s Day to you and all the mamas in your life!! 💗💗
Yeah I definitely think the wine thing is definitely worth the purchase just cuz you get the cute cups the other bottle I don't know maybe I would use it for like a water bottle or something but yeah that's the only thing I can think of to use the wine thing for I do agree with some of the other comments like just pouring your wine into it and bringing it to the beach if like wine bottles are not prohibited 😁
Capri blue Volcano is my FAVE candle! Nothing can beat it!
Pijamas don’t have pockets. Guy pijamas don’t even have pockets :///
Maisey saying "meh" and then bopping heads with Wes is just adorable!
I take that goli gummies! They have really helped my tummy issues, but it takes about a month before you notice a difference! So if you try them give them time before you decide if they are working!
I think those cups and bottle are for drinking near your pool. Also, they’re insulated.
Happy Mother’s Day Colleen! 💜You are a super mom! I hope you have the most wonderful day with your family. (:
Happy Mother’s Day Colleen I hope you have a good Mother’s Day!! Love ya 🥰🥰
One thing to note about wine is that you can't seal them properly, when they are already open. Air leaks into wine (depending on how deep your cork screw went, it happens more or less) and it makes it go bad quicker than when using a bottle with a more traditional cork..  Also using a bottle with a more tradional cork is far better when outside (ala having a picking or being on a beach), because you can put cork back on more easily. That also removes possibility of wine sweeping through an opening on the sides of the cork or cork popping off when bottle falls down.
"You can see my entire anus" I love the way you word things lol
I have 3 siblings that means 4 kids
What pajamas have pockets lol
I think the wine bottles are for people who like take them to public places and you don’t know there’s alcohol inside 😂😂
More episodes on haters back off pleasw
It makes the wine cold.
the bottle is good for places that don’t allow glass love u colleen❤️❤️❤️
For the 3D pictures, get light changing stands. It will amplify the awesomeness of the pictures
I have those preserved roses, they serve as a decoration piece
They r not pants (pajamas) but i do enjoy my pajamas with pockets
What is the name of the item you had made of the babies?
I can't believe you have never seen the the 3d portrait blocks. YOU NEED TO GET A LIGHT BASE AND SET THEM ON IT AND IT IS MAGICAL!!!! I have dozens of them. They are in my curio cabinet. All my love from Michigan ❤️
I feel like they are good to travel with to an event or something like that, but also, I have enjoyed an entire bottle of wine to myself in one sitting before and I would just pour the whole bottle of wine that’s been chilled already and then that would keep it chilled the whole time I’m drinking it. I feel like that might be another reason? But I honestly have no idea lol
Hi u should do like what you did with flin but with the twins the wierd baby producs
These bottles and cups have a double layer of stainless still with a vaccum in the midle, so they will keep the temperature of your wine or whatever you put in.
I think the cup and bottle are thermal flask type things so it would be used with mould wine out and about
I think the wine bottle and glasses should be for Erik!
Their little profiles in the 3D photo thing is too sweet
I LOVE THAT VOLCANO CANDLE, I’ve been buying it for years from anthropology they have a matching lotion
yes
CONGRATULATIONS! On getting a Teen choice award! You deserve it I love you ❤️
I thought the soap thing was a vibrator cause it looks like one of mine 😂 I was thinking like woah THAT's a nice gift
I LOVEE your reviews SO MUCH Colleen! ✨💓✨💚✨💓💓✨✨💓✨💚💚✨💓✨💚✨
You can’t take glass on the beach so this way you can☺️
If they were mens pajama pants they would have pockets 😤
The thermo wine bottle keeps the wine cold and is useful for traveling with! Like if you wanted to bring cold wine to a picnic or to the beach!
Happy Mothers Day!
Omg I love Amazon SO MUCH! 🥰
HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY COLLEEN! Have amazing relaxing weekend and sleep in enjoy celebration and all about you and so amazing best mom wife partner and so beautiful gorgeous and fabulous QUEEN i love you ❤️
Stop putting them in the thumbnail. Cringe
HAPPY FRIDAY Colleen! Have a great weekend xoxo 😘 💛✨💛💛✨💓💚💚💓💚💚💓💓💚💚💓💓💚💓💓✨✨💚💓
Happy mothers day! You guys are wonderful, strong and amazing people!
Yay!!  SO EXCITED!! ✨💛✨✨💛✨✨✨
So those 3D glass blocks were all the rage in the 2000’s. My mom has one that’s a lighthouse. I remember there being a kiosk at our local indoor mall that had the blocks in different sizes and dog tags that were etched too. Kids at my HS would get their sports team or something on one side and whoever they were going with on the other. An etched picture of them. Also, the etched blocks you could buy with a base that made them light up. I think they could even spin and do a rainbow of colors.
I think the bottle of wine keeps white wine cool for longer so you can keep it out
Um but could we buy the Miranda and Daisy 3d portraits for ourselves tho 😬
Happy Mother’s Day, Colleen!!!✨❤️💗❤️✨ So excited to see you in Toronto in 6 days!!! 😆😆 Yes!!! We Need Pockets!!! Those 3D pictures are so cool and weird!!! They awesome!!! Perfect for the Miranda photo!
Hey colleen, i just want you to know i love you videos and your probably not gonna get to see this but it would be much appreciated if you were to. Thank you for making all your channels as a safe place means a lot, i get really happy:)
I cannot SCREAM my agreeance loud enough with you about pockets. #womenwantpocketstoo
Omg the twins get cuter and cuter every video
in britian mothers day was on march  27th
Whenever you took out the cheese board and Maisy wined Weasley and Maisy bumped their heads together like it's a thing they do whenever they are sad.
100'5 agree on the weirdness of the wine bottle.  I am not a wine drinker but i have def heard that metal would effect the taste in a bad way.  since it is a totally lightless bottle it would make for a great way to infuse water! Say you fill it with water and a couple of citrus fruits.  In an hour or so the water will start to taste like the fruit. The longer the fruit stays in the water, the stronger the fruit taste.  Could be a fun thing to do even with the whole family. do it at breakfast time and then try it out with dinner :D
Colleen Balinger is so different from vlog Colleen-
The wine contrainer and cups are so you can bring wine to a picnic, the beach, pool, or anywhere where you aren’t allowed to bring glass bottles but still want to have a glass of wine with your meal. ☺️ It also will keep white wine or champagne chilled and red wine from getting too hot in the Summer. Happy Mother’s Day everyone! 💗
Thank you for uploading this in time for me to use Amazon prime
At 10:15 mom mood 😂😂😂
COLLEEN!!!!! you say that the babies look like erik, and they do, mostly flynn but maisy DOES look like you! <3
Happy Mother's Day Colleen!! You are rocking motherhood!
OMG COLLEEEEEEEN LOVE YOU!!
You would use that bottle for wine where you can’t use glass, like by a pool or on a boat.
Colleen: doesn't go anywhere. Also Colleen: doesn't understand that the wine bottle is a thermos to keep wine cold when you're going somewhere.  Give it to Rachel for dates with girlfriend.
Looks like the bottle would keep the bottle of wine cold. Or mix gin snd tonic and ice in it and your sorted xx
For the 3D glass picture things, there's little light stands you can buy to sit those on and it illuminates them so you can see the picture better.
Put the roses in your fancy pink bathroom 😂😂
Thanks so much I loved the video I have a tortilla talk question: which one of the twins look more like you? In your opinion of course
Guys mothers day was in March... 🤔🤔
What is a woman?
Colleen, Goli is a partner of Hello Fresh, one of your sponsors. That is probably why it was recommended to you :)
some wine you can get in boxes instead of bottles, so i guess if you don't finish the box wine you can put it in a bottle.
Try wigs some time?!  🤣
The 3D things would be better if they came in color!
Please gift Miranda in 3D to Kory 😂😘💜
Don't you have one of you and Rachel
Put water in those wine bottles! Great for keeping ANY drink cold 🥶
Colleen, there were also 4 DISHES there to put cheese and whatnot in!! LOL LOLOLOLOLOL
Say you go to the beach and you want to take wine what are the chances or a metal wine bottle breaking plus maybe it regulates tempature of the wine
Take a shot every time she says “recommended to me”😂😍
I would think that the "galaxy"wine bottle would keep the wine cold longer than it would be if kept in glass bottle
Colleen, you inspire me to be the best mom when I get the opportunity to have children of my own. You are such a great mom!
Wine decanters are to keep it cold like for a picnic or event.
The glass picture of the babies is the best thing you got. I think.
Happy Mother's Day
My guess is the wine set is for the pool or somewhere that glass in a no no.
This is the video you were talking about in your vlog! Thanks Colleen and Kory for all of these amazing videos! 😊❤️
I've seen people use those little wine "glasses" for camping, and I'd assume the bottle is so you can take the rest with you on a camping trip and not worry about it being glass?
Omg, the babies are so cute!!! This was so fun to watch. Lysm, happy Mother’s Day
I love the 3D pictures!
Stop using your babies for content
I love the 3D pictures!!
Colleen I can’t even handle how cute the twins are😵‍💫
Wait it’s not Mother’s Day yet! SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN IM SO CONFUSED
U chill the bottle then put white wine in it to keep it colder for longer than a wine bottle in ice does also you can chill the cups too
That looks like it might be a slide projector. So probably useless for you as I'd assume you won't have any slides.
Colleen! I think you should put the box of roses in your pink bathroom! It would match it perfectly!
Wine person here!! A container like that is super helpful to transport wine to places where alcohol is allowed but glass is not.
There are literal emojis for her fam 👩🏻👨🏻👦🏼👶🏼👶🏼
🥊🩴👩‍🦲
Volcano candles are amazing!!
Insulation is the only reason I can  come up with why you would pour a bottle into a bottle and they are portable too!!!
Maybe the bottle is for boxed wine?...
I’m not a wine drinker myself, but I think it would work for people that like boxed wine for like a picnic?? Otherwise it just seems pointless
The wine bottle probably just keeps the wine cool?
I have one of those 3d things and they are kinda cool! the one I have is a picture of my daughter looking up from above and the way its oriented is really awesome!
HEYY COLLEEN!!
I really really appreciate the fact that you take time to make this main videos! Watching your blogs we can tell how busy you are every single day. You're super women ✨💜
The wine contraption seems insulated and so is for travel! Taking your drinks to functions/the park or beach maybe?
i love how in alot of the amazon vids colleen wears the barbie tee and shes bringing it back
who else loves when colleen posts! <3 love you colleen!
Ok, I don’t drink wine but maybe the wine bottle is for pool days? I know some pools don’t allow glass bottles for safety reasons. So maybe people want to drink wine at the pool so they pour it into a non-breakable bottle? I don’t know…
The reason for the wine holder is just because of aesthetic-ness of it that’s all people really want but it might be cause of the Cork but that’s all I know about it! I love you can you please come to North Carolina for one of your tour dates…plz plz plz! 🥺🙏
I agree, I need pockets. I'm getting married this year and one of the requirements for my dress was it needs to have pockets and I found it. Yes, why don't we get pockets and when we do get pockets they are tiny pockets.
For the wine - if the wine is cold and you pour it into that bottle it will stay colder for longer. Whereas if it in the org bottle will go warmer quicker!
The wine bottle you could take on a picnic... ext and no,one needs to no you having a wee glass or two and it would keep it cool on a warm day xxx
💖💖💖💖💖💖
You put your cold bottle of wine in that bottle to keep it cool
Happy Mother’s Day, Colleen!!! You are an amazing mom and your family is so lucky to have you!! ♥️
Amen to bigger pockets… I bought my 1-year-old son a pair of shorts… THEY HAD BIGGER POCKETS THAN MY PANTS. Manufacturing companies think a toddler boy has more important things to carry than his 30-year-old mother…
You can take the lid off flowers to see the more
Maisie was definitely pooping when you opened the projector thing.
Happy mother's day! ❤💖👱😍
For the wine bottle the container hold the coldness of the wine unlike the regular bottle
🧡🧡🧡
Happy Mother’s Day!
The bottles are good for bringing to the beach, park, poolside etc where perhaps wine or glass bottles are not permitted. It also would be good to keep your white wine cold if you were outside!
Goli sucks Hello Fresh sent us free stuff and it said its not FDA approved and that theres no real science behind their products
also happy mother's day colleen!! may you and your children be surrounded by love and light all day and all year round!
My grandma used to have some of those 3d things, but they were lighthouses that you put a light underneath and it would light up the 3d part inside!
Hey I know why some people might use the wine bottles!! Where I live you are not allowed to have glass containers on or near the rivers or lakes. So if you want to bring a drink it has to be in metal or plastic. ❤
Colleen, I feel you on the pajama pants and the no pockets, but GIRL, What are you needing pockets for when you're sleeping??? Lol just thought that was a little funny
Women should have been born with pockets!!!!
Happy Mother’s Day Colleen!! 👩🏻👶🏼👦🏼👶🏼💚
men are always astounded at how important pockets are to women but I would love to see them live their lives with pockets our size and see how much they get done!
COLLEEN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Dude why r u so negative about all the products 😂 i swear alot of then were really cute! Even the pjs! I feel like you are not fairly rating these products cause ur in a rush
I'm dream for that pot! So expensive.
"She is a grandma, first and foremost above all" No Colleen, she's a human with her own needs and desires, FIRST and foremost. You talk a lot about being anti sexist, yet here you are categorizing your mom in a very sexist way.
I would use the wine bottles for water or juice for sure x
Needed a new ballinger vlog
Colleen I been watching you for 3 years I love you so much and I read both of Miranda sings books😁😁😁
I saw that "Juice" perfume in Cosmopolitan magazine and I've been wanting to get one! They had samples of the scents in the magazine a while back and they smelled good.
Ugh love being part of the early crew. Love this video. You’re wonderful! Thank you for all you do!
Happy Mother’s Day to you too!!
"Like- I'll have 6 more kids by then."  ". ...That's not happening."
my dad says the wine thing is a THERMOS. it keeps chilled wine cold on a picnic. hope this helps!
Happy Mother’s Day💜
You put the wine in the other container for places that don’t allow glass. Like at pools
Happy mother's day to you
Mother’s Day is literally so underrated
I mean I have never drank wine or anything but I think the deal with the wine bottle is what you said the cork thing and maybe it keeps the wine cold? Depends on what it says in the box.?
I love the twins the are so cute and you are the best mom
My cats eat all my flowers, those roses would be great!! Plus it would be hilarious to see them try and eat my flowers through the lid!! 😂
Hhhhhiiiiiiiiiiii
Idky I laughed so hard when you said Maisey didn’t like the cheese board. 🤣 I needed that. 🥰
Those “paper soap” are great for people who love camping. My friend has them. My mom and dad would actually enjoy them. They have different scents.
Happy Mother's day 💐💐🌷🌷🌷💐💐💐

Hi Colleen, I've watched you for years and followed your journey over the years. Ever since I can remember I've always picked at my skin, my face hands and feet and hair so bad to the point I have horrible wounds all over. Yesterday I was diagnosed with dermatillomania and trichotillomania. I have felt so alone in it for years and then I saw you start talking about it years ago and it helped me to know that I'm not alone in the disorder. I know it's been a minute since you've talked about it but I just wanted you to know that you have helped me finally get a diagnosis with it and that I'm so thankful to beable to watch your videos and know I'm not a freak and that other people suffer from it. I am so beyond grateful for your friendship even though we've never met. I hope that one day you will come tour in Portland, OR so that my son and I could come see your show. I'm sending you and your family all the well wishes and love! Thank you for always being here.

No one is trying to force you to buy. lol Yes, they are trying to sell.  And yes they are recommendations, whether they’re good products or not, but no one is forcing you. lol That’s every company out there.  What’s even worse than them trying to persuade people to buy things, is the fact that these same companies DO try and force political opinions and ideologies down people’s throats. Now THAT’S annoying.
How is it mothers Day ??
Happy Mother’s Day Colleen!!!! I hope you and your family have a great weekend!
