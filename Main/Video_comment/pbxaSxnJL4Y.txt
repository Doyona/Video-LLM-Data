WE SAIYANS HAVE NO LIMITS
We saiyans have no limits
Watching this and pretending like it was this morning 💔
This might be better than the unfusing Vegito Blue and unmerged Zamasu
We saiyans have no limits
사이어인에게 한계란 없다......
16:16 bro said the n-word so smoothly nobody noticed
I can't believe we were this excited for MULCH
Its so sad to come back to this video, watching the vegito animations and seeing how badly they have aged... Hopefully, we get an EZA for them during some celebration after the 10th anniversary
And here is where it all began
These characters are so hype. There's no way they'll flop in the future
Sad the unit isn't as good as his original 18 Ki Super. Still the best Dokkan exclusive animation to date.
Only took a year to prove that those saiyans have limits
WE SAIYANS HAVE NO LIMITS!!!
lol i finally have it 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone talking about vegito: 🐻 Literally noone: Merged Zamasu has one of the best osts in the game.. and he is the first domain unit ever!
This music is so sick!!! 10:43
I came back here after gogeta and broly came out 😂
Coming back to the video to announce as of the anniversary, they still haven’t synced the versions.
It's wierd because their attacks are kinda mid until after they transform
I like how Vegito blue's ultimate slightly resemble Gogeta Blue's skill with the Stardust Breaker. They both use these two blue ki blasts that does tremendous damage and then use their signature attack coupled with it. Stardust Breaker with Gogeta Blue and the Spirit Sword for Vegito Blue.
I just now realized where they got the 18 Ki animation idea from for Vegito. It’s in the DBS intro during the TOP arc and goku does it outside of his house with Chi Chi next to him 🤯 love that animation.
8:50
The only thing that disappoints me about this celebration is that now there is a 0% chance we're getting a dual Vegetto anniversary 😂
🗿
The best celebration worldwide ever just the announcers of both JP and global United and of course new summons animation excellent fucking use
Dude the introduction of this Domain thing makes me wonder if we're gonna see something like the domain gogeta and Broly made when they broke the universe or whatever
I miss koto already
I got zamasu second summon, so far I'm 300 into vegitos. So my question is, which do you feel is better?
they gave vegito his giga pumch but not zamasu 😢 zamasu is the one who originally wins that scene
I got them and they are CLEAN👍
The 18k from Vegito gave me fucking chills
Yo follow my twitch @Cinex_smoove plz
nice ai vegito lines..
Dokkan should start animating the new DB series ASAP!!
Does anyone know the soundtrack that is being played during the summon animation?? It is fireeee!!!
What does lr means
Time stamps for the characters: 7:21 they start it, 7:45 Goku and Vegeta Moves, (somewhere around here) 8:27 Vegito Blue’s active, 9:17 Vegito’s moves, 10:43 (Fused) Zamasu’s moves/intro, 11:43 Zamasu’s (Domain) and moves, 13:05 Charater abilities and stuff
Zamasu really said “Domain expansion”
The animation looks sooooo cool!!!! They better give Gogeta that Dokkan original animation treatment
If only FGO caught us up to the JP version😂 we 2 years behind.  But Vegito SA makes me hotter than I was for summer barghest
"Supa saiyajin gotto supa saiyajin"
LET’S GOOOO!!!!  YOSHAAAA!!!
Let’s go! Ez early 9th year
Vegito’s 12 ki looks good, but it’s kinda off putting.
when is the worldwide celebration
MY BOI NANO IS TRENDING!!! 😁😁😁
they just created a fucking domain expansion for dokkan😭. this is great
Okay let’s make it clear this new VEGITO is NOT the best, LR Eza VEGITO is the actual best, and he’s just doing double the damage compared and he’s doing it at turn 5 where as this new VEGITO does half the damage at turn 7 😂 Dokkan did you forget how powerful you made the 5th anniversary Eza’s
Zamasu is just simply the better unit, best extreme unit we’re gonna get and is by far better than Vegito. Goku and Vegetas animations look like the LR hit and Goku and all the budget went to his 18 and active.
Lol you can clearly see where all the money went! That 18 key and active skill from vegito blue were beautiful!! All of his other animations were pretty lackluster though.
Bro JJK season 2 did so well even dokkan battle added Domain Expansions💀
Can’t stop rewinding 18 ki of Vegito.  Dokkan really killed it with this celebration.
Not gonna lie, Vegito's 18 ki brought a tear to my eye. I know what I'm dropping all my stones on
Finally they respected vegito and gave him an amazing quality animations like the fifth year gogeta lets admit they did not give fifth year vegito as good animations as gogeta
I heard omatsu would be taking over the dokkan now vids in the future NOOOO MY GIRL KOTO!!!!! 😢
I’m ngl if I’m Zamasu and I see Vegito pose on me like he did in the 18 ki I’m rethinking my life
That 18 ki might have been a Dokkan original but that combo better become canon cause god DAMN DID THEY COOK
after watching this it just makes me sad that we could have gotten both gogeta blue and vegito blue and they both would look so fire
THE POSE  V EGITO MAKES LOOKS LIKE GUNDAM EXIA FOR SOME REASON WTF
They went all out with Vegito's 18 ki...it felt like I was watching a new fight scene...but man they could have done better with the rest...Goku and Vegeta look very underwhelming...they are not necessarily bad but we have certain expectations when it comes to the worldwide celebration...a new Vegito was welcome it just needed a tiny bit more effort for me so the unit could be more memorable like how the 5th anniversary units were
Is this anniversary event or something? Sorry im missing some of the points because i missed tons of dokkan contents. Was just tryna play the game again like this week
Domain is such a cool concept to apply for Dokkan Battle. I'm already imagining cool applications for it.   Can you imagine a DBH Hearts who activates his gravity powers and cancels dodging for all enemies and allies?
Damn that 18 Ki was CLEAN
calling it now, next anniversary we get LR broly from super with a domain for when they fight on that mini pocket dimension
500 stones, nothing
Usually announcements are whatever, but this was a BOMBSHELL
Awesome!!! Congrats Dokkan players!
Yoshaaaa
Gleich beim ersten mal Vegito gezogen und beim zweiten mal gleich hinterher 😁
ok, i was not expecting Vegito's 18 ki to hit that hard. HANDS DOWN the best animation in dokkan history
8:46 as a DBL player this part made me VERY scared.
Vegito 18 Ki is the most Unique out of all Super Attacks because it is after all Dokkan Battle Original like we never see this before.  Round Applause.
Kinda surprised the goku and vegeta attacks are just basic kicks and ki blasts. Gokus rage and back hand moment, Vegeta pummeling Goku Black and Goku Kaioken kick with his Kamehameha that made Zamasu all gooey.
We've done it. Vegito is now simply HIM.
Ain’t no way nano likes these animations 💀 bro would be entertained with keys dangled in front of him 💀
There’s like no content in this part 1 🤦🏻‍♂️
Nano not saying what is the ost is the most shocking part
Got new trunks animation 2nd pull and got the new AGL VB, we out here
Finally we get new characters when they drop instead of waiting months.
YESSS finally we are unifying both versions
I don't play dokkan...                                          But those animations were better than legends :0
Vegito's 18 ki is the best animation in the game
Where is the damn video of you summoning you rat boy hope you had got shafted
I got shafted lol 420 stones and I got one lr
As a F2P i can say i got shafted as hell
Would I be lying if I said Vegitos 18 Ki was best animation out of them all?  Fusion itself was good but Holy Hell that 18 Ki lasted forever and looked So damn clean!!
The ssb gods have mid animations and i would have hated them if vegito's animations sucked ass but holy fk that 18 ki super and active skill look beautiful
Wait a moment gogeta and broly when they break the dimensions could be another "domain" Unite IMAGINE ❤️‍🔥
Legends is better 🤷‍♂️
*Bro my eyes are S E T on that vegito blue to go on that vegito blue because of final trump card*
me waking up, banners are out. But i have to warch nano screaming and reacting them first before i summon….
As of commenting i have pulled vegito blue on first multi with the new summon animation of trunks rewinding the summon. And got lr agl full power frieza and new mai as well as more worldwide is treating well wish yall the best
That’s actually is so cool I mean some of vegito’s moves is from legends but better 🔥🔥🔥
Fuck this game
Zamasu has a domain expansion
NANO please... I know I am one of the million subs you have and prolly I dont mean anything, but please there is one favor to ask in the sake of the million db fans out there, for our childhood... Can you find someone who can remix this dope banger song of the new Vegito animation? ---- >  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRWMq1eOvis&ab_channel=TheNeos         The remix does not have to change anything at all, just keep the same soundtrack but someone can add the Vegito quote from dokkan --- > ore wa vegeta ta kakaroto no gattai. Vegito da. soste kore da vegitoooo bluuuuuuuuue ( sorry for the broken Japanese )  but everyone understood what I mean!!!   Please Nano you can only do this, unleash the banger!!!!!
I JUST PULLED GOKU AND VEGETA (VEGITO) LETS GOOOO NANO
This reaction was insane 10:26
Legends should of dropped an UCZ aswell that would of Been crazy
Finally candy crush got a new update
Vegitos 18 ki was crazy but his first super was mad ugly 💀
22:51 I am so happy for this
That vegito spirit sword hit hard damn Dokkan listened another vegito let’s go!!
i wish they had zamasu crying in his active before going into infinite zamasu
AYO
The Unification is bad guys 😂😂 Now we won’t be able to save some DSs by being spoiled 😂  Before we knew exactly what was going on so we could say « ok im skipping this portal because there is this one » THEY RUINED IT now that doesn’t work anymore 😂😂
Why dont u upload raid shadow legends? U advertise it no? Paid shill.
Ok. If the Int Transforming Goku Black doesn't get an EZA in part two of this... I'm gonna be sad.
FIFTH TO SEVENTH TURN??????? 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑 Skip Don't try to reason with me, I'm just triggered rn.
BRO I SWEAR I HAVE NEVER SEEN VEGITO IN A POSE MORE GODLY THAN THIS   JUST LOOK AT that .. I am bowing seeing that
He doesn't even have final kamehameha L vegito
I GOT THE GOKU AND VEGETA FIRST MULTI
Can I finally friend my jp account for my global cause I’ve got great units to help out for both sides 😂
520 stones and didnt get them 😢
Y’all gotta give love to zamasu, he literally changes the map and looks as cool as vegito blue
I know it came out
NANO NANO I GOT THEM OKG I GOT VEGITO BRO I GOT A TRUNKD SWORD OF HOPE SCREEN CRACK AND THEN NEXT I GOT TIME MACHINE ANIMSTION I HOPE YOU GOT IT IM SBOUT TO WATCH THIS VIDEO BUT PLEASE READ AND THEN MY IPAD RAN OUT OF CHSRGE AND I CAME BACK AND I GOT THEM OKG OMG OMG OMGGG   UPADTE: I WENT ONTO ZAMASU AND I GOT SUPER SAIYAN BLUE TRANSOFRMSTION ANIMATION AND TRUNKS AND MAI SCREEN CRACK BRO TELL ME IM NOT LUCKY TELL ME I DONT HAVE NANOGENIX LUCK I DOJT EFEN KNOW WHAT A SHAFT FEEL SLIKE
so cool
Nano luck is real, w mans. Pulled him while summing in the background
I summoned for vegito blue and got them first try AND I LOVE IT
Holy shit.  Vegitos 18 ki is by far the best animation in dokkan history.  I can't even express my level of happiness. In literally shaking
Zamasu really went "Domain Expansion" huh?
Vegito making the animators surpass their limits in animating, the animations look so clean every smirk that Vegito does makes giggle inside.  Truly one the best celebrations because the union of both versions of the game
500 stones and nothing man, i am so pissed
oh English dub 🤮
Got Vegito on my first summon
AND THEN IN THE SUMMON AFTER I GOT ZAMASU
NANO I GOT THE BLUES ON MY FIRST SUMMON
Was not waking up at 3:00am for this but I just spent 750 and pulled a copy of Vegito!!
I GOT ZAMASU FIRST PACK AMD I HAVE 4 FOR GOKU AMD VEGETA
Vegito (and goku-vegeta too) is just shit, delusional, garbage, representation of mediocrity (animations)
Dokkan finally did it to me I’m officially free from playing this game 1000 stones spent on anni not one copy after that I said okay and gave it another chance and summoned on this banner got dicked again I’m out it was fun for the 5 1/2 years I played
1k stones and didn't got them😭
All I'm sayin is it's a good day to be a Vegito fan. Got him 3rd rotation
Just finished summoning got 55% VB and Zamasu with a dup, still have 800 stones left. Good luck with everyone summoning, hope you guys/girls get the same luck i got.
Legends pushed dokkan to make such a change, both games are pretty much at their prime right now we love to see it
Just summoned on them. First summon on vegito. Got the rift and then two copies of vegito. Best summon ever ❤❤❤
What are the chances Koto got fired bc they unified the versions 😢
I don't even play Dokkan and this looks fire.
THEY SAID TWITTER LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We all joked about how it would be nice for Global and JP to run at the same time, but we never expected them to actually do it. This is the most hype I've been about Dokkan Battle in a very very long time!
Thanks you very much for the newest LR @naogen 24:11
JP version is joining with global I'm so impressed 😮
bros cooked up a five star meal
I’m kinda scared bc will global not get discounts on banners or tickets???
I love these summons 3 multi in and I got 2 copy's of vegito lol
BIG W
Is it just me or did we not get the 60 dragon stones? :(
2 VB's in DB games this year? Seems like theres a pattern.
That was a great Dokkan now, but i got kinda sad because of Koto not doing the show from now on anymore. What a bittersweet ending :(
ちゃんと日本語で喋れやお前‼️英語で何言うてるかわからへん。
I may be in the minority here, which is not to say I’m not at all happy or anything, but I did enjoy the fact that Global was a bit behind because we could always look ahead at the jp versions to see upcoming banners and what was worth summoning on, and especially for some f2p players, what to start saving for.   We’ll see if this is ultimately the best decision when it happens, but it’s definitely big news and a big change.
That is awesome with the same time celebrations and anniversarys 🎉🎉🎉
Is Nano still going to play both JP and Global at the same time now that it's unified? I wonder what the dynamic is going to be
Zamasu is the best unit in the gane
Guys what  time they came out
Bro, Vegitos swag in his 18 ki is unrivaled
Not gunna lie this should have been the 8th anniversary characters this is more hype
Man, 5th or 7th turn sucks, most "missions" are done by that time really.
Nah I’m good on the unified, it gives me a reason to not play since I don’t know what’s gonna happen so I don’t get anytime to prepare at all
We all know vegeto blue hyped up more people than anything in db dokkan
YOSSSHHAAAA the hype is crazy rn. May RNGesus bless us ALL!
As a dbl fan that sometimes plays Dokkan, im so happy for dokkan, best celebration ever!!! Both games doing so good just gives me joy and happiness!
So they added domain expansion
When is the banner dropping
When will they drop on global??
Vegito is majestic.
GL SUMMONING IM SO HYPE THEY COOK WITH THIS EVENT
So it's going to be released today right?
Unifying both versions for the same date makes this celebration even better
now we need a new gogeta blue and broly lr revamps
When do the summons go live?
We're losing koto😢
We need more dokkan first attacks HOLY SHIT
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
that Vegeto is fucking nuts
By unifying the versions that means Truth doesn't get to double dip for the character videos but he has been preaching it for ages lmao. Insane news
Bro i hope vegitos ultra attack become a staple for vegito in future games, call it like excalibur rush or something and its def a classic
9th anni Sasuke and itachi confirmed
Unifying them is now scaring me that the 10th will actually be the end of dokkan making new characters but maybe not shutting down the servers. It's a good thing and I'm happy but it's just a thought I now have after hearing this big news....
As someone who started on Global and just never wanted to pull the JP plug. At level 920 with nearly every character in the game after 8 years, to now be told they’re merging.. I had goosebumps and tears in my eyes. Fuck yes
Bye Koto😢
9:36  Nano: Its Okay 9:40 Nano: Wait Yo! 9:54 Nano: OH MY GOD 10:16 Nano: *Howls at the Moon* 10:25 Nano: *One Last Wolf Howl then becomes speechless for a moment*
The fact that they are linking makes me concerned that the game is gonna shut down soon.
VEGITO BLUEEEEEE
THATS MY GOAT
Yeah baby slot 1 for teq eza vegito lets gooooo
Bruh this is literally the reign of vegito blue in both games
We hit 20k on the live right? i wasnt able to attend it sadly please someone let me know
Can you imagine something like this for Gogeta Blue?
Honestly seeing these custom animations is giving me hope that we might get a custom beast gohan sometime in the next year. They’ve gotta know how badly they fucked up their last attempt, and that making a good beast would sell like fucking crazy.
Yess 190+60 thank you
So when do the summons drop
Just based off that big announcement at the end I can almost guarantee you dokkan has 10 or perhaps more years in its lifetime. That is by far without a doubt the greatest W dokkan has ever had and probably will ever have.
the unification of both versions might make me redownload the game
Kinda sad that they will unified both now. I won't be able to save for specific units again XD
Let's gooooooiiii
Zamasu is gonna be an absolute tank.
Such a mid reveal, this is why legends is way better
Lets go the most mid looking summon animation
Vegitos 12 ki looks so subpar 😂
I really need the anime to come back so we can finally get Moro, Gas, Merus and all them in the game
Meh it not that good sadly
5:02 NANO: "Number of dragonstones will increase to 4 and 5 respectfully" 😂 basically the event will be in awe of our dedication and increase the reward later.
Nanos reaction to unifying global and JP was amazing 😂😂
when do they come out
超ゴジータの二枚目が出せてしまう
I always ask myself, how dokkan tops their animations, and if they can ever top it again, AND THEY ALWAYS DO BRO
The LR vegito blue is so innacurate that we could get ANOTHER for 9th anni 💀
Zamasu is much better than vegito
WHEN DO THEY RELEASEEEEE
Idk why but I really don't like some of the animations from Goku and Vegeta and vegito, except the 18 ki sup
Havent seen anything yet but giving it a thumbs up cause I know its hype 👍🏼
9:55 bro think he is ssj2 goku in buu saga 😭
I still need a standalone LR Blue Vegito, i stopped using the f2P years ago. That 18ki is straight 🔥   Edit: And he's also AGL!! I needed a AGL unit in my realm of gods, Dbs gogeta just isn't doing it anymore
So… full dodge then?
I was heavy leaning on summons for Zamasu but after seeing that vegeto 18 ki idk. That was crazy.  edit: Dont even care about that anymore. Global and JP together finally, hype
For those who don't understand domain just think of it as a yugioh field spell
Japan contend and global its no more now we call this World contend
So they're willing to give vegito original animations but not beast gohan smh
Dokkan is now United with the complete world oh yes men its about time 8 and a half years in the making now its Real what the F.....  🎉🎉🎉🎉
I BROKE MY PHONE BUT STILL HYPE
banners are dropping 1:45AM in united states central time! good luck to all?
Unifying the versions is like the worst thing I could have expected. That is what I liked about Dokkan, I could kind of prepare for what I wanted to summon for and now that is over. This is the worst celebration I have had on Dokkan.
This Zamasu Domain feels Like one of these field spells from yugioh
WHERE THE HELL IS MY INT TRANSFORMING GOKU BLACK EZA!?!
THEY ARE SYNCING JP AND GLOBAL HUGE WWW
Wen are they coming out?
How many more hours to the banner?
I was treated really good this past Dokkan Anniversary especially considering I’m a FTP player. I pulled STR LR GT Vegeta, LR PHY SSJ4 Gogeta, STR LR Cooler, STR LR FP Frieza, AGL LR Kale/Caulifla, TEQ LR Zamasu/Goku Black Rose, STR LR UI Sign Goku, and TEQ LR God Goku/Vegeta. I still wanna pull this Vegito and Zamasu if I can help it.
Then, vegito its better than tanabata goku sjj4 now?
The animations look fan made but this is awesome!!!! (I know it’s real but I’m saying the animations kinda look fan made but awesome)
Ok!!! Ngl, this actually is making me want to come back to the game
I WANT MORE DOKKAN SPECIAL ATTACKS!
GUAHHHH DAYUMMMM!!! COOK DOKKAN COOOOOOOK
I’m sorry Vegito>gogeta I just had to put it out there
I was expecting the same with Vegito's ultimate in legends, something unique and not the traditional final kamehameha. I wanted him to do something with the spirit sword and in dokkan that's perfect. If the same would have been in legends, it would've looked much better.
Animations was really not good at all, only vegitos 18 KI looked fire
Best celebration in gacha game history
I dont know which im going to summon on vegito looks beautiful and zamasu is the best unit in the game
18:18 its like a yugioh field spell, think of how the seal of orichalcos raises your monsters attack by 500.
THAT VEGITO 18 KI WAS FUCKING RAW! SO FIRE! FLAMES
As a legends and dokkan fan I admit vegito at dokkan is a little better than legends
Wow. Unifying both is so awesome 🎉
They just casually dropped info people were wanting for years like it was nothing.
So...when are these banners out?!
Mmmmm if we get 9th anni in January on global that means that the Worldwide units will return then?!
Finally Vegito has animations on par with Gogeta Blue
They have my boy  Zamasu a domain expansion 😂
Nano i just want you to know that i didn't underatand a single word you said when reading their passives lol. You dont HAVE to read that fast man.
I doubt the schedule is same during 9th anniversary.  Only because they said it would be noted at a later date. Which means it could be anytime from now and years ahead.  Maybe mid 2024 when they get it, but most likely not, because jp is light years away.
i dont get the little balls in the vegito attack
i’m sorry these units the celebration all the new things they said everything that was revealed destroys year 8 entirely
Phy ssj2 goku
When vegito blue and zamadu's banners gonna drop?
12:12 Zamasu's Justice & Order
Global W
Better than legends right??!!lol legends stepped down in the ranks. Dokkan came with the clutch.
12:00 Infinite Zamasu attack: The Light of Doom
BRO KOTO IS SO ADORABLE
11:42 Infinite Zamasu 👹👹👹👹
Now watch jp still get more stuff than global regardless of "schedule"
10:43 Zamasu's double standard
Vegito is just lr gogeta and vegito combined
The bombshell at the end... HOLY HELL!!
As a free to play, having 50% less time to save for the 9th anni kinda sucks, but I guess that will be the biggest hurdle, after that it will be link normal. Just no more future sight on banners
i liked being able to save stones ahead of time for stuff
I wish it was soh trunks :(
9:38 How epic it would have been if Vegito Blue used that in the anime!🔥🔥🔥
Koto noooo
They outdid themselves this wwc bro im goin all in on vegito
NGL, I found it funny that both you and Diddy have similar thumbnails but mirrored. Anyways I hope everyone has good luck summoning!
Bro if the 9th anniversary is coming sooner now for global I don’t got the stones man I went so deep in the 8th 🥲 as. F2P player i have done everything that can get me stones so I don’t see how I would even have enough stones for the these banners then the full power ssj4 Goku that’s going to come out and then the 9th year anniversary
Under campaign details.
Dude, the announcement for eza teq trunks and agl zamasu was in global as well...  Does anyone know how to read and look out for stuff?
Ngl they burned the whole kitchen
Vegito proving why he dah goat of Dragon ball  🔥
Vegito looks so clean😮‍💨
Blue goku and vegeta supers are very very lackluster ngl、but the ki on the 18 ki looks amazing. Vegitos super attacks look insane and awesome. And all of zamasus are..... boring.
when does the banner drop
Really appreciate Nano doing us Dragon Ball fans a service and reading the subtitles for us, we really struggle with that.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😊
When are the Banners gonna go Live ?
DUUUDE!! THESE UNITS ARE WAY TOO CLEAN!! Zamasu’s 12 and 18 ki supers are great, but Vegito’s is ASTRONOMICALLY better! Definitely gonna give summoning for them a try this celebration!
The intros are probably some of the worst ones weve gotten in dokkan tho 😭 (excluding osts)
We’ve received unification…but at the loss of Koto….😞
domain expansion zamasu
I feel like we can get a buuhan with a domain skill of when vegito gets absorbed. It can be like the inner workings of buu
Dokkan really pulled a domain expansion mechanic
Vegito 18Ki Dokkan Original Special looking so damn SICK is such a good sign for this game's future units.. 💥
THEY WENT DUMMY ON VEGITO
Very disappointed by Goku and Vegeta’s super attacks but I love how unique Vegito’s were. They tried their best.
Am I reading this portion of his leader skill wrong along with zamasu but does he technically lead super class 150% and additional 30% to realm of gods ? Then zamasu whatever his is or does super class just get 150 flat?
Vegito has a 170% for 3 catagories 2 more catagories to get to a 200% and then any other super class character gets all stats 150% bro thats insane.
I feel like the anniversaries will stay the same since global and jp released at different times. Everything else should be unified.
9:42 I cant they literly called the animation a "Vegito Special" which is hilarious.
sadly most animations are wonky as hell
No yosha !!!!!!!! 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
It lowkey irritates me how much zamsu's animations are done with MUCH less effort
The VB is really good and is the best unit in the game but this makes it the same as Legends as well as they made VB the best unit in the game. Then dokkan decided that they want to unify to make it a international drops for everything. Not sure what is going on but i feel like we will see more on Legends and Dokkan. As you can see from the VB they have been working long on the character probably just a little longer then the Legends VB. Plus both have something new with them. I wonder if they are giving each other ideas.
Now this is truly a YOSHA moment
I love one piece but omg XD Vegitos foot work puts Sanjis in the dirt. Dude uses his feet just as a brag that he didnt need his hands.
Vegito in vegito is lr cooler on crack
And like that Nano goes back to Global main
Zamasu's Domain Expansion is busted.
When is the banners dropping
koto got fired 😭
Dude the devs are so ugly
We have Domain Expansions in Dokkan now. Crazy. Waiting for Cooler Domain soon
Was at the live they were cookin Fr fr
Yup, this is Dokkan's year. The flames of hype are reignited. New original animations opens up a new realm of possibility for every character, the flames of the current WWDC will continue to rise, and 9th anniversary is upon US ALL!!! DOKKAN DUBS ALL OVER THE PLACE1!
This is unreal dude
Here hoping they fix the friend system
Nah they absolutely COOKED
I’m getting ready to start summoning
You going to donate your global account to a new user??
wait a minute…that transform and domain condition…”or there’s future saga ally attacking in the same turn” woah they can turn 1 transform and domain? that’s nut
I am HARD for vegito blue
Haha, that game catch-up announcement had Nano shook. I can't wait... it's going to be so cool to actually be SURPRISED and HYPED by units and celebrations now, instead of sitting around with "foresight" like dumbasses.
Vegito 18 ki is so elegant!! i love it
Wow- they actually gave Vegito 2 entirely new Super Attacks. Bravo Bandai. Bravo. But.. 170 and 150 leads for an LR? Wtf??
Am i the only one but seeing koto here makes me feel she's sad coz this is her lst global dokkan now, koto took an L so everyone on global can take a W. I really do hope she'll still work on global dokkan at a high position though.
So zamasu is basically the toon town environmental card from yu gi oh
couldnt care less about another vegito 😴 the only thing that im so unbelievably happy for is the unification of JP and Global
vegito's voice sounded weird
I’m hoping I get lucky with LR SSB Vegito can’t wait for the banner to drop !
What about Turles on global? Are we getting his banner and the next banner at the same time?
We erasing the universe with this one 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
WE CAUGHT UP TO JP FINALLY!!! LETS GOOOO. IF YOU SEEING THIS TRUTH I LOVE YOU LMAO
YES THEY ARE UNIFYING JP AND GLOBAL!!! I’ve wanted this to happen 🥹
When is the summons going to be available?
Ngl the animations left a lot to be desired
Forget Infinite Zamasu, AGL Vegito Blue is a must have!!
Not to be that guy but man if this is the vegito IMAGINE how they cook with the eventual twin gogeta card. And with a new broly 🫠😤🔥🔥🔥🔥
PEAKKAN BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOSHAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay, besides that fire Vegito 18 ki, they looked really janky, am I the only one who saw how fanmade they were looking? Reminded me of the ROF Blue Bois animation, which is okay but still. Zamasu was pure flames though
As a og global player from day one (only took a break for about 6 months after year one anni). I am so ready for the versions to be unified. But I'm happy I was able to take advantage of ticket summons while they lasted lol
nano should drop a rap album the way he reads those passives
Domain expansion
Vegitos 18 ki is absolutely beautiful. If you had told me when I started playing during the 3 year anni that Dokkan would look like THIS I would have called you a liar SO fast.
I’m really happy that they unified Dokkan.
This is the best celebration ever
i dont know i see so much references thats cool
Worst thing about all this is I got 700 stones ready to open but I got no space for characters anymore. I'm gonna have to baba my units. I don't know what I should do.
Vegito's animations got me screaming, I'm going all in for him.  This 100% the best celebrating in history.
400 stones saved up for this baby!
This seems more hype than the anniversary!!
Imagine an LR Hit with Domain skill where both allies and enemies cannot attack (Hit excluded) and Hit deals an insane amount more damage. Would go hard ngl
I’m gonna be honest, I’m a bit disappointed. I’m a bit disappointed from the units. It could just be from first time seeing it, but we will see from actual performance (I wish vegito had the melee counter and blast nullification)
So I’m spending on VEGITO BLUE and Saving
TEQ merged zamasu is ded. finally.
DOMAIN EXPANSION: GOD'S JUDGEMENT
First, Kai no longer appears in Legends Reveals and Stuff, now Kotto won't appear anymore, damn
Yo version schedule sync up is HUGE, makes me more excited than ever for dokkans future. No more waiting ages for JP anniversary to come to glb
Thats why he is the goat and g fusion
Easily the best celebration
Koto was becoming too popular so they're getting rid of her. Bastards!!
lets go world wide is fire, and Nano is almost at 1 mil subs!!
I guess it means that 5 months unitl anni i guess 😅
I have a feeling at some point dokkan is just gonna be like hero’s and create there own character and brand new animation.
they missed the opportunity to use final kamehameha in the end of vegito blues 18 ki but doesn't matter. This, this is insane! they cooked and we received 🗿
NOOOOOOO NO MORE KOTO 😢
I’m ready for my 1,000,000 mb download to unify them still hype though
9th anniversary coming 6 months early 🎉🎉
Even though I only play dbl and prefer it over dokkan it looks pretty cool
Now there's hope for stand-alone Beast Gohan 😭😭
the unified announcement brought a tear to my eye wtf LMAO
When Zamasu Laughs Nano Laughs as well makes me think is he a Zamasu of this universe 😂😂 so synced up
Literal fan-made but INSANELY well-made
10:15 My boy got so excited he had to call in the wolf pack 😂
All 500 of my stones going straight to vegito. GL everybody.   I'm also super happy vegito AGL. This is exactly what AGL needed.
And this vegeto blue
I'm new to dokkan. Does world wide mean the English version of the game?
Best reactions on YouTube like usual!!
for a wwdc LR w/ that hp restriction and from the 5th turn not even stacking atk or def is kinda disappointing
Can we please get an EZA for the Phy transforming for Vegeta please
That 18 ki blue vegito is the best animation in the game of all time, holy Jesus they popped off
Domain expansion
Just wanna ask when will the banner drop ?
When the banners dropping?
Was there for the stream. Was hyper as hell, it also was the first streams that I tuned into and loved it
So when do the banners drop?
Vegito: STARBURST STREAM!!!!!!!!!! 9:46  9:47 9:48
RIP "Cooperation Between Rivals." You were always there for us, but no longer :'(  On the other hand, those animations are lit! Also, you don't need to keep running two Dokkan accounts anymore with the Global/JP schedules being merged!
The duo super attacks give a nice glimpse of what the blue duo can do if they were to simply jump someone and it is beautiful
Just a question, so when actually is the banner release. They were a bit vague with it
The production value of Vegito's Dokkan original attacks just blew the doors wide open for any and all characters.. imagine what they will do for Z Broly, or another SSJ2 Gohan.. bro I am so happy we all get to play and enjoy this game
Curse domain ZAMASU
Its crazy how all their supers look like they’re gonna finish but unexpectedly added another blow that’s crazy
Honestly VB 18 ki carries the whole unit, every other animation was decent, but i still think ssj4 Gogeta has the better 18 ki animation.
That was so cleannnnn
Imagine they did super class red zone in part two. Like u ha e to fight vegito blue and sword of hope trunks
Bro the 5 year LRs are going to COOK on Vegitos team
After this i hope they keep making more dokkan original animations🔥
They were losing me for a while, then animations weren’t all that at the start. But gotta admit, they pulled through for the 18 ki on vegito and goku and vegito. Best 18 ki in the game, only contested by maybe 2 units.
Nano reactions are the best when they don't show the next part straight away aha!
I seriously can’t remember anyone’s passive anymore. I normally figure out what they do through a video lol
The REAL Fusion is Global and JP not Vegito Blue nor Fusion Zamasu.
THE ORIGINALITY HOOOMG
The only thing that sort of sucks is the 5 turns needed to activate the transformation. I want it now 😩!
When does the summons drop??
Okay... the new characters and animations and events sound so damn cool. But the best thing out of this whole thing is that we are FINALLY GOING TO BE SYNCED WITH JP LET'S GOOOO! NO MORE LOSING HYPE 🔥🔥🔥
Gogeta boys where yall at 😂😂😂  TEAM VEGITO
Why do they have to remove Koto though!?!?!?!?!?!?
That Vegito 18 ki is absolutely amazing,I have never seen such a badass animation before
Can we use the active skill in slot one then move him to slot two so we can have both passive effects?
Vegito legit pulled up and said... 'I got some new shit for ya!'
Hi
Is it wrong that i now want to see a Dokkan battle original animation of gogeta blue
If you pause at 10:15 it looks so sick
Seeing a very happy and excited Nano means this celebration will be AMAZING!
Hi
Love the creativity but I am personally not a fun of the animation
There merging versions too😨????
Nano is the reason I started playing dokkan and the reason I got back into legends. He is simply entertaining
Dude the fact that it changes the background is so cool!
8:44 imagine if UVB in his intro sounded like that instead of "AND THIS IS VEGITO ᵇˡᵘᵉ!"
I feel like a hater because these animations aren't really doing it for me
The 18 ki is the best part of the video!
I CAN DEFINITELY SEE WHIS HAVING A DOMAIN ABILITY🗣🗣🗣🗣
Vegito will have damage reduction plus stacked defence plus dodge plus an additonal super with a possibls super with 20 ki or more all while being the first attacker not taking into account the extra defnce from all his supers
YOSHA
Greatest moment in all of dokkan history, amazing looking units, new mechanics and the global catchup cant ask for me
I'm not okay with the schedule merger. No foresight, probably no tickets is terrible for Global. Gonna be summoning way less now.
welp im not seeing any new animations
Watched live on twitch and now watching it on here again love the content <3
Definitely on par with Legends' take on UVB.
I literally made a fan card of SSJ4 Blue Gogeta and I said that he nullifies all attacks directed at him. I made it like 5 months ago or something.
Yoo that vegito 18ki and active skill are fire!
Wait so now that JP and global are unified does that mean Global is gonna get the 9th anniversary just like 3 months after the 8th? 😂 lol
Hands down the best worldwide
I love how everyone is talking about vegitos 18 ki. IT IS JUST THE BEST 🔥
Who let them cook!! What the hell , vegito has gone beyond perfection.
I regret to inform everyone… someone cooked here
Diddy sauce title card????? 😂
Why didn’t they name him fusion zamasu half corrupted 😭
I just know Truth jumped up and started doing the Griddy when he heard this
This maybe the Vegito stan in me, but those animations blow away a good chunk of Gogetas without contest.
prediction they have a LR kidbuu that domains swallow when.super buu and then turns into kid buu after
Def hitting a mil this celebration
Zamasu domain just means a JJK collab is in the future 😅
When will the banner drop
yall think vegito 18ki rivals all active skills??
That vegito 18ki is 100% up there with Beast Gohan active, Gogeta4 Active and even Gogeta Blue’s 18ki!
VEGITO IS SO CLEANNN  OMGGGG
They popped off on vegito’s animations ngl
They could've put a drop more effort into the animations for the Vegito unit, but I still love it.
legends makes me hate Vegito blue dokkan makes me respect him🫡
W
W CELEBRATION
YOOOOO NEW SUMMON ANIMATIONS, YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
Overall good animations. Not super duper consistent but still great.
holy shit you already uploaded your video how tf
dokkan finally understand how to drop things don't do data download before so we get these reactions nano
Vegito Be Op
Should've been an LR Future Trunks instead of a Vegito SBB
Now when do the banners drop
that gundam pose in vegito 18 ki is so damn good
will be the greatest Celebration in dokkan history forever JP and GLB sync
WE EATING GOOD PEOPLE 🙏🙏
Vegito 18 ki super has took the crown for best super
So when is it coming
Syincing Global and JP > Vegito 18 ki dokkan original > LR TEQ Fusion Zamasu > LR AGL Vegito Blue
Dokkan cooked a whole buffet!!!!
Im a free to play player and i grinded 1050 stones just for this man. I hope i get em.
LESSSS GOOO
Best celebration in Dokkan’s history fr
Nearly cried from VB's 18 ki 😭
I came
Dokkan best never stop doing dokkan original super attacks CUZ WHAT
Meanwhile, I will forever never understand why Lr ultimate letdown has a 70% chance to super on 20ki.
9:40 that’s the best frame in dokkan history
vegeta and goku's animations are kinda okay. but if they didn't use the major scenes that's kinda good right?
That attack Blue Vegito does at the end of the 18 Ki that launches merged Zamasu into space makes me think of the attack Goku did to Kid Buu.
I love it
When you realize Dokkan gives more respect to Vegito than Super Dragonball Heroes
Bro gogeta with the DBS  broly artstyle with dokkan original animations will break dokkan battle if vegito looked that good
When do banners drop?
The day a gogeta unit gets this much love is the day I can die peacefully this Vegito looks FIRE
DUDE, LR AGL VEGITO IS LITERALLY LR TEQ VEGITO BLUE, BUT BETTERRRR
When does it drop
WE MAKING IT OUT OF ULTIMATE RED ZONE: DISMAL FUTURE WITH THIS ONE 🫡🔥🌟💯☠️🍻
We got caught up with the timeline, that we lost Koto 😔
Bruh vegitos 18 ki Made me have an orgasm like 3 times 😂
The animation looks sooooo cool!!!! They better give Gogeta that Dokkan original animation treatment
So hyped for these units, good luck to everyone summoning!
Vegitos eyes bro 10:23 😫😈
i wish zamasu's entrance was when he screams and powers up after goku kicks him
WE WIN!
catching the game up is the biggest thing ever done
Tchooooooow✌🏼
The animations are better than the 8th anniversary
Cooked
Watch them fumble the gogeta blue and broly celebration after this like lol 💀
Super Duper W
Vegito is going to slice through my wallet just like he did in his 18 ki
Unification of schedule. Y'all hear that? That's Truth fucking SCREAMING.
Love it.
Why is no one talking about how good this zamasu animation is, like without vegito 18 ki zamas might have better animations
A lot of people dropping JP to go back to their global accounts after the sync release, we back baby Dokkan is back! 🥹
They shafted my man zamasu didnt have his version of their clash  and his supers are soooo sorth compared to vegito
As a vegito fan boy, Im gonna fast for all of tomorrow because today we ate good
never thought i would see the day that I would lose global foresight
Holy fucking shit that 18 ki on Vegito is FIREEEEEEEEEEE
GLOBAL IS SYNCHING WITH JP WE WIN THESE
Don’t think the games catching up is that good, cause now Global players won’t know what to save for, and people who have played JP for all this time could legit just have played Global then
OH NAH THATS AMAZING
just when you think vegito's 18 ki is over, he hits you with a point black final flash
Bro honestly I just hope the give us a catch-up celebration on global dropping all the content+ maybe tanabata units
LET HIM COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK
Global getting in the time machine to go to JP's timeline!!!
Dragging out dropping the banners smh
All the animations except vegitos active and 18 ki was, put simply, ass. The VA sounded choppy and weirdly sounded like Vegito was oit of looney toons. But i love the fact that global is syncing with JP so we global boys wont have to wait 12 months for VB and Zamasu to return eyyyyyy 😅
Vegito’s 18 ki is IT. It is the coolest looking attack in the game! If only they put more effort into the other super attacks for that unit though…
I don’t play Dokkan anymore but vegito looks amazing, might have to start playing again🤔
i don't get the sync part, does that mean i'll be able to like switch language on my jap account?
The “dam it all” was so quiet for some reason
The unification is easily the best part of this dokkan now no question
Nano I was on diddy’s stream while he was making his thumbnail for his reactions and you made the exact same thumbnail as sauce man he was mad tho
this is why im a vegito fan boy
Bro jp and global on the same schedule  Dokkan literally cooked us a five course meal
I never knew that vegito was secretly Kirito cookin up that vegito special better than Sanji, Gordon Ramsey, and Souma combined
Nano been looking handsome lately
Zamasu animations are way better
Dokkan is entering a new era.
I'm a bit concerned. The intro was definitely Sean and Chris as Goku and Vegeta, but when they fused into Vegito that was not them. It sounds so fake, it's like a fan dub, wtf?
Lets go!!!
That Vegito 18 Ki is the best animation I’ve seen from this game in YEARS!
One thing that surprised me is that VB's 18 ki super is so long and cool, also the active skill it's just damn good
Am I the only one thinking some of these animations fell below their recent standard?
That's all the active is for vegito
I NEEEEED IT
Vegito's 18ki is sublime
THE VEGITO SPECIAL!!!!!!!!! LET DOKKAN COOK AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!       YOSHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!  Edit: Now that WWC 2023 is over. FUCK THIS GAME! PULL THE WHOLE BANNER EXCEPT FOR LR VB
ILL HAVE YOU KNOW I IMMEDIATELY LIKED THE VIDEO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
i have like 170 stones and a dream, i will get zamasu by the end of this celebration
Dude, that 18 KI animation for Vegito Blue is absolutely without flaw.
They actually snapped with the vegito animations
Whens this banner coming man
Vegito’s animations are mid
This is one of the best wwdc ever
GLOBAL AND JP Finally coming together as one. ✌❤
It started slightly rough but by the end i was just like Heisenberg thinking "someone cooked here"
That active skill saved my marriage
This is the BEST celebration in dokkan history ALREADY simply based on animations and the fact that GLOBAL IS FINALLY CATCHING UP LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
POV In Diddy's stream
I'm in love with vegito's active skill holy shit..
Bro they overcooked
All the budget went to vegito’s animation
If there was ever a time to use the Michael Jordan "I used to pray for times like this meme" it's now
Was just waiting for the reactions
Nano I too nutted to these animations 😩😩
Zamasu's Leader Skill is Better In My Opinion.
I CANT WAIT THESE GUYS LOOK AMAZING
THEY COOOOOKED
Vegito's active skill and 18 ki are the best I've ever seen 🔥also they did their own super attacks and looks more amazing!! Good luck 🍀 to y'all summoning and get em' in first multi ✌️
Dokkan fans eating well
Unifying both versions is probably the best thing in this entire presentation
We all agree that all of vegito’s budget went into his 18 ki super right?
Nano…..hear me out. Imagine a Gogeta and Broly with these kinda original animations. It’ll go CRAZY!!
nano published this video so quickly
Don't know what it is, but Vegito using Final Flash looks so weird to me
Bro stole diddy's Thumbnail XD respect to my dude lol
amazing thumbnail nano!
I'm hyper ventilating... this is too much, send help💀
I had to watch the dokkan now on YouTube during your zamasu reaction because I had 5 ads unskippable 💀💀

360 STONES AND A DAMN DREAM BROTHER
LETS GOOOO ❤❤❤
They cooked 😭😭😭
It’s a good day when Nano post a video😊😊😊
That 18 ki is the best 18 ki in the game, its not contest, every active skill in the game cant compete either with this godly animation
lets be honest the real huge W here is Dokkan JP and Global are both emerging with the same update in time (schedule). NO MORE WAITING 6 MONTHS- 3 months etcc
The animation for goku and vegeta are so cheeks omg and vegito is alright I guess
