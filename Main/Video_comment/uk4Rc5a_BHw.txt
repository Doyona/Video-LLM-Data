rip stressmonster101
gem looks like a cinnamon roll but could kill you and will kill you.
"I am basically a fish!" #1 best quote ever.. gem is the floppiest fish😅
Nah, Pearl should have won Demise out of pure principal. That is criminal having like 10 people gang up on one person to make sure they die. That is even worse than having one person pvp another to death.
GRIAN YOU ENORMOUS ANUS XD
Looking back, trapping Iskall’s house may have been for the best
I can’t believe she landed on a poppy, stoping her from a bucket clutch.. the chances….
Watching Gem do all of this fishing has made me aware of how derpy squids look. Like their head is a block. liiikee. What???
Y’all lynched pearl 😭
17:52 "and i have the Donkey (the) whole time (Don Quixote)"
Do it in VR 😂
I DONT WANNA PIVOT
rewatching all your hermitcraft s10... Absolute cinema
Gem: I have TNT minecarts but i dont want to ruin anyones base Joel: 78 TNT MINECARTS FOR XB!!
Heheheheh i love how a flower was the reason of your demise😂
13:55 bro was using multishot on a fishing rod 💀
are there any dutch fans here that thought of ter zee ter hengel en in de lucht with the fishing rods?
I was watching this a bit sped up and grians laugh sounds so funny sped up
I can't belive Grian kill her but..They are like best buddies!!
Who is here in 2025 happy new year 🎊🎆
i had no idea fishing rods multiplied force like that, thats soo cool
I’ve found your channel because I wanted to see a play trough of a trial chamber and I have to admit your absolutely amazing  Your manor is adorable yet very intuitive and inventive, I was only going to watch the trial episode when I had a sneak peak of your future base, which made me want to watch the whole series haha. I love the idea of a good horror base, but you took that idea to an whole other level!
13:43 massive W
The fishing rod shenanigans reminds me of bungee jumping it was hilarious
I just introduced my sister to your channel, she texted to say, "You were right. I'm hooked."
is it just me, or is this hermitcraft season 10 more like 3rd life?
I love watching Grian's decent into madness from other's perspectives
this is like minecraft avengers or smtg
10:30 ish I was laughing so much
Finished
1:02 Yoink! 2:49 Giving Etho a tour 9:01 Failed trap 11:56 Gem: “I want to kill somebody” Cleo: I get that” 15:33 Fishing Pearl 18:13 Fishing shenanigans 22:34 Hanging out with Stress 25:44 “Well, I’m a murderer!”  27:23 Watchception 30:55 Good vibes
Love how she dies via fishing rod and then completely forgets she can fishing rod Xisuma, despite it being in her hands multiple times while looking down at him
Empires session 3 pls🙏
30:17 adequate!! its gotta be scar.
Gem trapping X in a hole and repeatedly failing to kill him was extremely entertaining. 😂
18:01 Oh my god launching Pearl had me cracking up so hard I woke up my wife 😂
my dog's watching me watch gem watch impulse make a mob farm
not sure if anyone will see this but which level is the best to stripmine?  i always seem to get so little and see alot of people getting good amounts of diamonds
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤
21:08 why did he bounce im sobbing
I love how Impulse builds while Gem just watches him.
12:03 LOL was this the clip False thought they were talking about her (Brain cells)
Give it up for Brian the first to clutch!
Why don't you guys wear chestplates?  Or rather, why is it always the last armor you make.
The Hermit Fishing Slingshot is by far the funniest moment in Hermitcraft history!!! LMAO!!!
This video in an emoji: 💀
Thanks for always providing the cozy vibes Gem :)
skizzophrenia was very silly in this video
i kinda want to see someone change one of your signs to "Just Gem" now. am i the only one?
Dig a hole (in a doorway or hallway so they dont see it) that is about 20 blocks deep. Then put slabs, water log the slabs, and dogs. They fall in, hit dog tryna escape, dog kills thm
I love everyone trying to fishing rod everyone and Cleo is just like “guys my stuff,” and Etho is the only one telling her where her stuff is
The thing that is so amazing about hermitcraft is modding, it’s subtle, nothing game changing, just subtle modding to make it more interesting
Protection 4 is the best enchant for armour
ive been missing out in life not watching gem. I'm complete now!
Gem: very worried about how much damage 3 minecarts is going to do next to a base Meanwhile  Joel and grian: no regard for anyone’s safety including their own or tan tones bases
WITHER; DONT GO TO THE NETHER THERES A TRAP THERE
WITHER AND WARDEN; YEAH LOOK WHERE UP HERE HAHAHAHHAHAHHAA😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
“You don’t really want to blow up someone’s base” *laughs in Joel*
Fav part fishing trend X3  WOW from trying kill to just making ppl fly for fun! 😮Now thats my fav part!
1:07 the way i audibly gasped at this moment, my mom thought i was crazy
Really, the whole episode was a "string puppet"!!  And I LOVED IT!!!!!
11:00 uh, don't worry, I think Joel has you beat on that front, lol
They need to make the death message for death by fishing rod "___ was sent into orbit"
in gems defence, she landed on a flower
Lines that are so much funnier now: Grian saying he is just fishing a bit until he gets a mending book You asking if Grian's getting addicted to fishing
The real question is how many treasures you could get with doc’s episode one
coming and watching gem's POV after being fully up to date on grian's is REALLY funny because she feels bad about placing 3 tnt minecarts to kill stress.... and then grian and joel with 74 tnt to absolutely obliterate XB very funny contrast
Welcome to Geminibay enjoy your stay
We never knew the trendy fishing with groan would lead to his insanity
11:51  "Hi Cleo!" Cleo: "Hiii. How are you doing?" Gem: "I wanna murder somebody" 💀 Cleo: "... I get that."  Mood 😂
A little late, but in response to "Permission to come aboard", you could say "Come aboard".
The foreshadowing at the start of the episode was wild
Gem could have survived if there wasn’t a rose on the block she landed on
The whole launching people is a good way to find your home if you get lost
Gem- "I'm a murderer." *giggles* 🤣
That feather falling would have been helpfull half an hr ago lol
well... u can block a sign edition with some wax
Gemini slay and now Gemini betray
1st episodes are always some of the best ❤
On this day Geminitay betrayed her friend
1:23 that flower ruined the clutch, you were so close
Gem: Pleeease!!! Die?!?! Please!! XD
not the fishing rods XD
The rose stopped the bucket 😔
They def should set up a launch platform for when they all have Elytra.
gem: i wouldnt like to be known as the person whos bad at traps  grian and joel: 👁👄👁
<3 <3 <3
"Hi Cleo!"  "How yah doing?"  "I wanna murder somebody."  "........................I get that."  Just the best vibe.
"You are going to see the void " ~~GeminiTay 2024  😂😂
Oh if that flower weren't there the bucket clutch would've probably worked 😔
The way a Dutch mc server has figured this out way before them, and made it a whole game in their town
U are the best.    London Kentucky
His laugh is so effin contagious. Grian got way too much joy out of that
oh yeah watching all the first episodes is extremely much content, I decided to do so before watching any of the later episodes. I'm not even 100% sure if I actually managed to watch all of them and didn't forget any...  for the record, I set a limit of max 1 hour, so no I didn't watch Doc's (even tho I really wanted to)
Gem being like: "its episode 2. Time to get diamond armor" had me laughing
seeing gem be surprised at grian fishing with 2 lines after grian's latest episode is hilarious
Btw maybe late comment but scar sometimes does the buildings before the terraforming and terraforms around the build
The head noteblobk thing is vanilla, its just that there are more heads
rip, the poppy doomed you o7 (it was so hard to spot too)
Minecraft fishing: All the cool kids are doing it.
“I wanna kill someone!” “I get that” 😂😂😂
"I wonder if Skizz has any signs."  Flashback to his first episode.
0:30 why does this give me stressful school vibes “we are picking up RIGHT where we left off” 😰
Xisuma should know that dripstone spawns naturally on diorite. Nothing at all suspicious about that.
Cleo to LEO with that fishing trick.
THE FLOWER is what stopped you from clutching that water bucket
things you should never give grian (updated list): - an easy spot for a trap - literally anything explosive whatsoever - a fishing rod
1:05 3:02 5:35 8:35 13:50 15:53 17:48 18:08 18:56 20:05 21:05 21:25 22:00 22:14 22:28 25:15 27:22 29:50 30:30
They banned pvp for demise to nerf Gem specifically.
omg that hermit particle cannon was so funny I knew fishing rods could send you flying but I had no idea how much that many people using them on one person would add up LMAO <333
W
@22:10 you missed your chance to say, "etho is sqwashed up!" 😂 jk ofc!
This is my first season watching your series and it is incredible! I love your energy and creative ideas!
23:17, i hear that noise, i leave my mate to it....for 3 or 4 minutes
In terms of Demise, would placing a lava bucket be considered pvp?
£10 says you do smell, £100 say's it's a nice smell and £1000 says that smell sign was Bdubs....😂🤣😂
I was stripping mining when she was and we both found a geode at the exact same time
I had fun from a different pov :)
Hey gem after Grian got you did you know that you had a voice crack? I think Grian realized you didn’t notice it and was laughing at that.
if there’s anything we’ve learned from these episodes and the life series, it’s that fishing rods create their own content and i LIVE for it
the bounce 🤣
they seriously fished each other into space
When will you learn? It's not enough! He's so patient lololol
Human baseball
The fishing rod thing is giving off  “OH OH OH ME NEXT ME NEXT “ Type of vibes 😂
I'm glad everyone is taking it slower. Seeing everyone in nearly the strongest gear possible, starting mega bases and opening multiple shops with in the first few episodes of the series always put me off for some reason. Maybe im bias though because im an extremely slow Minecraft player lol.
Girly you should really build a fishing village on your side of the mountain, or maybe convince them to build an empire city on the hill idk 😂
Terrain needs to go first UNLESS you are Fwip in which case you can castle first ground later
The power of teamwork in that rocket launch
I did not know if you put a head on top of one of those jukebox thingies and makes the sound of the animal, that's cool!
Going with the "Boating and Fishing" theme... maybe your 'Mega build' could be a dry dock for ship construction and the mega base could be the ship the dock is building.
I’m SO glad everyone on the server is always such a good sport about things like that!
how to work together video!!
3:49  We finally have an answer to the question "What does the squid say?" (old minecraft video).
Nasa: *attempts to perfect space travle for years* Minecraft players: *uses a fishign rod to send half to server to space*
Y’all I’m a little slow so can someone explain to me if this is just her starter base then she’s going to find somewhere better to build her mega base at Orr is this blossom hill where her mega base is going to be at?😂
"It's getting exausting tring to kill people"  - Gem, febriary 2024
the secret of fishing rod is that someone needs to pull the person before the otherones so that they doesn't touch the ground any more, this happend all the time with Grian fishing just a little bit before you guys, that's also why he didn't launch as high the 1st time you launched him (the 2nd it looked like he hit a block or sth like that)
In this video you have the end of grians first episode, and the start of his second.
I love watching hermits get launched in the air <3
A mini game with fishing rods and hermit's golfing needs to happen 😂
Am I tripping or were there multiple times she has referenced Step Brothers...?
If no one else's signs are getting changed, I guess you'll just have to do that yourself. Be the (sign) change you want to see in the world
Those flowers will get ya, Gem.
"I can make tnt" - well someone didn't learn from cub To make sure they die, you also destroy all of their stuff. all of it.
" hes up, up, up, up! " " HES HIGH!? "
Poor pearl... Imagine you are just chilling at your home then suddenly 5 ghosts and 4 grim reapers appear to fish you through your roof... terrifying.
is it just me or am i the only marine who is watching gem
I think there should be a fishing rod game that requires hermits to build a team of fishers and fliers  1. How far a player flies (like javelin throw) (Waterbucket clutch fails, score is zero  2. How high a player flies (if waterbucket clutch fails, score is zero)  3. Chicken game, The player has to spam throw item individually while in the air. if the player feels like he is about to hit the ground, he has to equip waterbucket for clutch. The score is based on the number of items thrown. If player failed waterbucket clutch, score is zero
This is the new version of boatem and I am so here for it
Gem! Can we have a tutorial for the dredge boat please! I love it so much!
whats the name of the mod used for the mini blocks and mob/player heads?
Who started hermitcraft? I thought maybe grien but he joined in s6 which I find so odd 😂
We need an auto fisher that will cast a line solely so you can have a few of them attach to a person and launch them I stead of rockets
Great thumbnail
Well Gem muat have had quite some time mining in with people putting out almost 1 hour long ep1's, and Doc trying to match an uncut LotR movie.
don't worry gem reendow is already known for being really bad at traps
Gem's background music is actually so nice, started dancing around my room to her voice and the music without even realising
I like how you look at Skizz and Impulse talking ant think they're just hanging out when they're actually just plotting to kill someone
Welcome to the Minecraft Space Program 🤣 I can't stop laughing 😂
iam sensing noteblock+squidheads on redstone repeaters to give that 'at sea' sound effect.
you can wax signs with honey to prevent them being changed (someone can still 'break ---> replace --> rewrite' the sign)
the flower killed her :(
Whats the background music at the start of the scene
I feel like you could make the fishing pole tower a game later a competition if you will. You start of with certain levels and if you die your done. As the level gets higher aka the scaffolding gets higher so do the number of hermits. Level one could be 5 scaffolds high with 1 hermit. You increase by 5 or X amount. Everyone has to buy an entrance ticket 1 diamond block at least. Of course to survive, is the classic water bucket clutch. If you get damage you’re still in the game. No armor or just leather armor.
Grian's cackle when he kills Gem is pure malicious delight
4:21 Gem, your friends aren't talking, they are plotting murder. Literally.
loved the fishing funtimes this ep , between iskall's ep2 and this i've been cracking up
21:30 Thats the special thing about Hermitcraft that I love😂
And GeminiTay's "player slaying" strikes again! 😂 But you ended up getting somebody else instead. 😅 (That fishing rod hilarity though!) 🤣😂
1 dripstone is more damaga then 5 :)
Geminislay is a lot nicer than a certain fan of Cub on the server lmao
The communal fishing and fishing/launching was awesome!!
Great video Tay!
Noone geta signs changed quite like yours do..........me: think back to Hermitwars..remeber that it started over the same sign getting changed a few times on a prank....ohhh the memories...lol
Also Gem...u were Destined to die....skizz and impulse were about to try and get ya but then Grian did.....u might have aeen the vid..but still thats crazy...lol
GEM...." IM A MURDERER".....all her fans:...yes Gem we all ready know this..lol......ichanneling my inner bugs bunny......."NICE KABOOM GEM".....lol
I really want to make fanart for you but i don't really know your usual minecraft skin....😅😅  so i quite make a difference between the usual one and secret life looking
#49 on trending on 2/8/24
Grian's always been Fishy
The mob head music basics IS vanilla. The head drops are the only non-vanilla part which had an update at the same time as 1.20.4 for parody with vanilla mob heads
Anyone else start watching Gem to help get enough Etho in your day between Etho videos?
For the bayes u could even bring the water up like they do for dams and have a lock so that the water levels can be different
FISH
Your laugj is so cute
gem. i had mac and cheese today and can never unhear it
I'm a tiny bit disappointed Gem didn't put her trap inside the Monstrosity
Omg the slingshot fishing was epic !!!!!! I so needed that laugh today !!! Thanks guys 🙏🙏😁😁😁❤❤
I don't think I've really watched  a Gem video, but now I'll be coming back. I really enjoyed it!
structure then terrain then organcis in my opinion
24:38 Murder camel Murder camel Murder camel! 30:33 The discriminate signs against Gem might be out of fear of the murder camel vibes
"Cleoooo I want to murder somebody", Cleo: "I get that " 😂😂
Omg bro gem is so iconic I’ve been watching her since I was 13, I’m 17 going to 18 now. Love you gem!!
Someone should make the slingshot a game mode, make like a whole arena out of it and like host a weekly event for everyone
you guys did pearl so wrong
9:40 "you just tried to kill me, well done on that!" - A professional minecraft player (Xismua) 2024 🤣
The fishing scenes brought me back to the golden days of minecraft content ❤
3:50 Omg wait you could hide that note block somewhere with like a super delayed Redstone clock so that it just auto goes of every so often
Hello Gem. I have to say I loves hoe Grian 🦈🐟🐠🐬fished you out of your fishing spot like that. it was great. That is so cool that you also watch all of the hermits to. I love getting to see you all & I save each video to. With 28 of you now  it takes a really long time. I love this world to play on. 1 of the guys has the seed posted & I now have it to. It is so cool looking.  🐟🐠🐟🐠🐟🐠 I love Grians fishing pole I want 1 like that. 😹😹😹.
i enjoy the slower pace a lot! early game minecraft my beloved. and no matter how many people change the signs *cough*etho*cough*, gem will always be great!
You should change your minecraft language to pirate speak!
Well thats an execution
It's Fishing Season in Hermitcraft
The 'Grian'.... scream
I love how everyone enjoys fishing right now! Fishing is genuinely my favourite thing to do in Minecraft and it's exciting to see that the hermits enjoy it as well!🤩🤩
Etho -Oh no I let water in!  Gem -And then you close the door  Gem is so patient with the boys 🤣 I'm loving all the interactions this season, it's Hermitcraft: The Social Season
The incredible YEETs of this episode: 1:07, Gem 18:22, Cleo 19:13, SkizzleMan 21:26, Grian 22:30, Etho
I think you just found a new elytra launch with those fishing rods. I can see the synchronized elytra flight team now, or perhaps a launching competition to see how far you can toss someone
Gem is great! She would've clutched that if the poppy wasn't there. imo it's more death by poppy than death by Grian 😆
I love how all the Hermits are close together during the early days and interacting so much more on videos and streams!
how did she get launched that high???????
You guys should do a secret meeting room in the centre of the cherry mountain that connects your bases with tunnels
Oh no grain has had his break with wars and he might start one about FISH
I exist.
the irony of watching stress's video first and wandering over here to hear you go "i dont wanna set a tnt trap"
Ok, Gem is bubbly enough to earn my sub.😂
Steamboat Gem. The next Disney princess.
The 'grian stole gem's brand' bit is funny. tho I really like the idea of their bases (and possibly others) blending together. It's so cute seeing them fish from their own little docks together!
i actually lost it when skizz blasted off like team rocket
22:14 "Etho hit the Sound Barrier."
21:08 is Grian Bounce.
17:56 is the Fishing Launch section.
the funniest part in the beginning is that she would've ve made the water bucket clutch if it werent for that flower
Skizz mentioned the fishing rod incident on his stream. Great to finally see it!
Etho and Gem give Favorite Uncle and Favorite Niece vibes and I love it
skizz being flung out into space made my day XD
One Of Gem's Signs, After I Changed It:  <Insert Name Here> Changed Gem's Sign  Disclaimer: The Inserted Name MIGHT Not Be That Of The Actual Culprit
26:00  Iskall's house exempted in this SPECIFIC case.
Would be great if gem had changed all the signs without showing it in everyone's base
Deadlier Than A Kerbal Space Program's Sequel, Hermitcraft Fishing Rods Are.
I love Grian’s cackle
Me:  Puts Efficiency and Knockback on a Diamond Hoe, after pulling a G.O.A.T. and breaking the game to get illegal Knockback levels.
You forgot Feather Falling, Gem. You forgot Feather Falling. That's why Grian managed to get you.
Need to make a target!
Gem: just back to basic tools. Also Gem: using a diamond pickaxe
Impressive reflexes. If you didn't have a shield, you probably would have lived.
Are we gonna talk about how the hermits can just do all of the things in one episode that I might do in the entire world over the span of a week
You should get a fox and name it Annabeth
Im such a huge fan!
Hey GeminiTay....How about me you and some peanut butter?
Gem: I was a little worried about blowing someones base up or destroying their stuff. Cub: Get rekt scar
I think the rose prevented you from doing a water bucket clutch
Legend says grian is still fishing to this day
22:13
Stress dying to a trap that was set for another hermit is such a Stress thing to do
Etho reached terminal velocity.
HERMITCRAFT WATCH PARTY AT GEM’S BOAT!!!
When I saw the part of them doing the fishing rod thing. I automatically thought of that one scene (the soulmate series) when they did the same thing 😆
I 100% completed Dredge in just 2 days... 😅 can't wait to see more of your plans for this season! So excited
omg i love watching everyones diff pov of the same event!! for example i have watched all of the magic mountain residents ep 1 and they were all equally hilarous (especially seeing the pivot scene in grains pov and gems) 🤣🤣
Poor Pearl man, the sheer terror she must've felt.
Etho hulk smashed to death 😂
I absolutely love the creativity and entertainment that the Hermitcraft fishing rod scenes bring! It's pure comedic gold!
Gday Gem. Please change Iskall's ugly build a few blocks every day until looks decent! lol
The fishing rod scenes had me smiling uncontrollably
Which reaper got the credit for Pearl's demise?
That was an epic death. Sorry Gem.❤
How would you rate the video out of 10?
When you don't know what to do so you make your dad build your science project
This was an awesome episode! Thanks for showing us what Hermitcraft is about: fun, games, competition and camaraderie.
fishing polling everyone as an initiation is so funny tbh
🎣 op in pvp
that was eFISHient
she really said "I, I"
Look up up up up He's HIGH?
You should start changing all the signs on the server regularly.. 😏
so glad they didn’t jump into it insanely fast like normal with netherite and flying, etc on episode 1 or 2
This was so much fun to watch! Minigame idea: hermit darts, teams of hermits launching hermits with fishing rods with points for how close to a target they get + bonus for clutching the landing.
You nailed the thumbnail
It's so refreshing to see people taking it slow in minecraft. It's cool to see a bunch of stuff done after the first episode sure, but it gets old when it seems like everyone is doing that. Just like your hardcore series, I've really come to enjoy the slower, but more deliberate progression in your videos, and some of the other hermits here. Leaves more room for interactions too and thats really what makes smps special
The way the hermits had so much fun, just from flinging people in the air
Gem said she watched all the Hermit's first episodes, do you think she watched Doc's three hour long movie?
"let's see how much i can get done during a 45 minute video"...  My first thought hearing this was well that's def not doc's, lol.  Some of you can beat the entire game while watching his first episode lol.   Looking forward to what you all do this season.
hey im watching hermitcraft while also playing mc (not diamond mining but dye making)
26:36    Hey gem you could make a well in that hole like so you can have that leading up to the enchantment area ❤
11th on Trending! WOW!!
As someone who loves to fish in Minecraft to pass the time (you can get so many good items!) and was strip-mining in my singleplayer world while watching all the day 1 episodes for Hermitcraft S10, I related to quite a bit of this episode. I'm also already so excited to see what direction you go in this season! Dredge is a super cool game and I'm already so excited to see a water-themed (and perhaps underwater?) base from you, especially with a coral reef biome nearby for easy access to some cool blocks! I was re-watching S6 over the break and I missed when the ocean update was super new to Minecraft and everyone was experimenting with conduits and underwater builds. Also so wild that you're already in your 3rd season of Hermitcraft--I found myself getting confused watching S6 back, thinking "wait, where was Gem basing this season?" before remembering you joined in S8. It's hard to imagine the server without you now, you bring so much awesome stuff to it! Excited to see where your perspective of S10 goes ^-^
W
Love the pace of these episodes!😊
I just love xisuma reaction to the trap lol
That intro is very Joel coded
i didn't have the hermit space program on my bingo card for this season
1:10  Poor Gem, she would have landed that bucket clutch and survived if not for that poppy.
What are the essentials to become a hermit?
"Cleo fell off scaffolding" is a grave understatement, lol
New minigame: Hermit Hurl!
you should do the fishing rod trick on the april fools moon update
Gem with a diamond fortune two pick axe in the second episode “not the best …” me with a iron one in the fifth one😢
We need a Cleo / Gem alliance next limited life series. xD
Multiple fishing poles may be the funniest thing I have ever seen in this game.
I think credit for that kill goes to the poppy the stopped the water being placed instead of Grian
I love Grian maniacally laughing after killing Gem
I'm seriously so excited to see what you do with your base this season!! Building a bay from total scratch is going to look so freaking cool. Ever since you mentioned Dredge in your last video, I went and bought it and now I'm OBSESSED with the vibes and tone of the game. It's literally tailored to my tastes. I cant wait to see if/how you incorporate The Horrors into your builds this season!!!
I need to see the multi-person fishing rods used as an elytra flight launch system at least once please Gem
I loved seeing Etho launch and immediately get slammed back down to earth, that was hilarious
LOOOOL I love stress, she's hilarious 💀
"Well, I'm a murderer!" *_*giggles_**
omgg hermitcraft s10 ;o
13:00  Someone who traps Iskall, guaranteed to become his great friend eventually. Grian killed him a lot and created Sahara just like a sign of fate. Hopefully that happens too.
I'm just Gem, anywhere else... your sadness about the signs gave me Barbie vibes haha 😅
Gem: "I wanna murder somebody" Cleo: "I get that" lol 11:54
I think I woke my family up laughing at the first launch.
the best way to fish imo is to have the fishing rod in your offhand while swimming around and killing fish with a sword at the same time
You could've fish Xisuma like Grian did to you. lol
Hermit Space Program
Second episode lets go
am i the only one boggled at the thought of sleeping irl wastes time while sleeping in minecraft saves time
Doesn't help when Hermits like Docm77 extends the video to almost three hours long. [|})
Love how you show the realism, taking lower enchantments to build up, showing it takes time to do things and appearing to genuinely enjoy playing! It's great to see. Thanks Gem
Gems murdering people and Riding a Camel... its Secret Life season 2  Also has to be said "Murder Camel, Murder Camel, Murder Camel, Murder Camel"
Good old fashioned hermits utilising minecraft mechanics to place players in terminal danger.
You can try waxing the signs. So others can't edit them😊
Naw. That red poppy actually killed you gem. What are the chances that you try to water clutch on a red poppy
Sign trouble? Welp, time to get to beekeeping for some wax.
Xisuma congratulations Gem on the attempted murder was so cute
'Wait i bounced .....' famous last words
Hermits and their fishing rods, truly been a thing since double life. Now with Fishing (rod) duo, aka Gem and Grian this season...  I love the shenanigans. They sent Skizz into Orbit, truly.
12:50 Well, that sounded like Scar was on the 'strip-mine playlist'
8:54 it perfectly matched with the beat of the song.
I can't wait to see man made horror beyond human compreation
Hermit shenanigans are my favorite part of hermitcraft! Base progress is always good, but man, do I love the days when episodes dissolve into launching people into the stratosphere with fishing rods.  Good times.  All the progress us viewers have seen has been great!
Hermitcraft Space Program 🤣
fWhip said that a sniffer under a old boat is great cause it creaks ;)
That “gem smells lmao gottem” sign is the most Joel insult I’ve ever seen written lol. That’s exactly something he’d say.
"This season on Hermitcraft, Grian shatters everything you thought you knew about Minecraft."
Hahaha 😂 I knew it was coming from Grians vid but I laughed so hard at Gems demise 😂😂
Don't know if it is only my audio, but I had to adjust my audio several times, due to different volumes and some peaking of gem and pearl's audio. Loved the  episode
I am really loving the interactions between Etho and Gem. You can tell she's really earned his respect through their pvp training in S9, and she demonstrates a level of confidence that perhaps might feel refreshing to him, I've seen so many people including hermits say they find him intimidating and unapproachable (not derogatory just that hes very good at what he does and it makes them feel insecure) and it feels so wholesome for Gem to see Etho as just another human with whom she hang out and play minecraft🥰
We're blasting off agaaaaaaaaaaaain!
The animators are going to have such a fun time animating the fishing scene lol
we got the hermit space program this episode!
I was genuinely confused about what hermit would say "lmao got em" on a sign, and then you mentioned aka reminded us all about Joel being on the server and it suddenly made sense, that is a very Joel sign!
This episode: Fishing for content and building the Bayse.
I am you tuber  Mera Nitesh Kr sah 5687 hai Mera channel se Aapka help ho sakata hai   Nice video 📷
I am living for these early game shenanigans with so many hermits together!
If gem was fishing from her fishing boat she wouldn't have been fished lol
it's like double life all over again with these fishing rods
gem: "you dont really want to destroy someones base' cub: 'bet'
On Todays Episode: Hermit Space Program
They say the greatest fishing catch is man, better people say it's Gem
Will be fun to it again but you get elytra (fish your friend and send tem to orbite ) x)
30:46 on any-sign else she'd be a 10 🫡
Grian has to have best reaper kill for that; although, Stress being nosey with that chest is a contender.
Gem's new skin looks so cool.
Gems audio is not great.
Gem and Grian are just the most wholesome pair. 😂
Gem being the target of sign sabotage doesn't surprise me one bit😂. Maybe you got to find a way to pay them back🤔. Just so they know with whom they are messing with. I know that you've got the creativity for that😉
stress and gem are such a fun combo i love their giggles
The start of a new season always inspires me to start a new world. But playing alone is not as fun. Thanks for letting me live vicariously through you and all the other hermits.
I don't think anyone will look at the very bottom of your boat, so consider replacing a few blocks of the bottom with chests or whatever else you need more of
I didn't know minecraft had a space program. 🤣
"Skizzzz crack" took me off guard 😭😭
0:17 Doing it without a shield is easy. Getting the timing down with a shield in the off hand is the challenge.
These are my comfort videos 💙 - loving this nostalgia trip that you and the other Hermits are causing. Keep it up Gemini!
I enjoyed the episode very much, it was very entertaining to watch and cant wait for the next ep!
who all new about the fishing rod thing
Oh man Grian got her out of nowhere lol
21:10 “wait, I bounced” *splat*
My first season watching. Gem is actually the one who drew me in and omg. I am not sorry.
I'm sure that Scar would be happy to hear that you shouldn't explode someone's base.
I feel like y'all need to do the fishing rod launcher again but slime blocks instead of water. Extra bounce
Yall need to make a game of hermit golf with the fishing rods
How do you have the time to watch every HC players videos, plus play as well? I need a week to get through the 20 people I watch. Added I do watch other youtubers and play MC too. I have even had to speed up to 1.25 just to get all my things watched.
How do you make your character look like you? I want to but I can never figure it out
Thank you for another amazing episode. I'm enjoying the vibe of early season very much and am looking forward to the Bay slowly coming to realisation.
“Well, I’m a murderer!” I think we could tell from other series’s 😅
Extra Nice  💚💙🩷💚
I was editing a minecraft video while watching a minecraft video of someone who was editing a minecraft video while watching a farm getting built in minecraft.  (Edited video not on this(my) channel)
I love the Impulse and Gem have a big bro and lil sis relationship! ☺️
got em = cubfan
Gem is great
She would have done that clutch and survived if not for that poppy 😂 the poppy killed gem
Gem, you happened to choose the best schick.
#14 on trending! let's go gem!
More with Etho please and thank you <3
You guys should all make your shops inside the mountain and use the existing crevices as future ways for people to fly in!!
Fishing rod scene made my day for sure. I laughed so hard
Oh god Xisuma tanking everything Gem could throw at him was comedy gold. 😅  Edit: i take it back. I needed my puffer for those fishing rod shenanigans
“48 isn’t that bad!” lol Girl! 48 is what I dream of getting even with fortune 3!! Love you Gem, you make amazing content!! <3
The signs, the fighting with fishing rods… peak sibling
I wonder if Gem watched all of docs first video? haha
Hermits space program 😂
I feel like half the times Gem says "Grian" it's after he kills or does damage to her.
Glad gem is taking influence from my favorite 2023 game lol, tho i noted how she said she needs alot of water and a bay, im fairly certain shes taking influence from stellar basin, it just feels like a place youd enjoy and would look nice in a mc setting, if not, consider it a suggestion :p
I've heard of Hermitcraft before and I've watched Grian's videos but I started watching everyone since the last ep or two of last season because of your vids <3
I think building a fishing boat infected the server with fish brain, where instead of brain there is fish. First the fish noteblock and now extreme fishing
Oh that's so unlucky! Missed the water bucket clutch because of the poppy on the ground
I saw the first death of gem in grians episode and i was so suprised gem never noticed, but watching gems episode ut makes a bit more sense
death by flower
The taking turns at  fishing rod flying had me laughing so hard
A++ Hermit fishing content, both the footage of Hermits fishing and the footage of fishing for Hermits.
great episode!
Watching Xisuma's POV he said his face hurt from smiling so much after your demise attempt. So cute. He was so proud.
You can fit 5 Minecraft boats in the area of your house
ya-*YEET*
All the fishing makes me think the reward is villagers 🤔 maybe they’re restricted as a way to up the season difficulty
"PLEEEEASE DIE" 😭😭😭
This is your sign to spread silly signs to all signs. Fight with wit.
Like Grian said, it's come full circle. Demise inspired the life series, and now the Life series tactics are showing up in HC to get people to kill creatively.   That scaffolding is giving me serious limited life Skynet flashbacks! Lol
Gem, loving the slow pace this season. Also was super excited to hear that you really enjoyed, “Dredge” it’s such a fun / cute little game!
😂Oh my god I really love this episode it's so funny 🤣🤣 when you all use a fishing rod. It really made my day happy
i am BEGGING for yall to launch each other with fishrods again once you have elytra. its gunna be the hottest new fast travel trend
"GOT EM" is an anagram for "To Gem"
This season of Hermitcraft is just THE BEST!! Also, I love that you watched the other Hermits while mining.. just like the rest of us!
OMG!!!! Hermits fishing hermits had me laughing SO HARD!!!! 💕💕
That was some amazing fishing in this episode! Might be fun to turn that into some kind of game/competition later in the season.
“He’s high? oh MY GOD WHAT-“ ~scar 2024
To be fair, Gem, I think you actually did pull off that MLG water bucket clutch, but you landed on a Poppy, so the water didn't place properly. Had the Poppy not been there, you probably would have survived that landing. 😌
Fishing rod scenes are always hilarious and I am yet to be proven wrong
The Hermitcraft space program is fishing rod powered.
famous last words "ohh no i bounced"
What sound would a player head make??? Like grian or etho or pearl.
Anyone elese start singing "Down by the Bay~" when Gem said she wanted to put in a bay?
Considering what you started working on at the end of the video, I really hope you refer to your area as "Gemini Bay". :3
#13 on Trending! Let's go GEM!!
That fishing rod death while fishing was the best death i have seen in ages!!! The setup was hilarious and full of failures, the observation skills were utterly lacking and the perfection of that one hook was amazing...
The reel (haha) question is, can you hook each other, launch one person, at the peak launch the second person, and re hook and relaunch essentially flying
Smallishbeans, am I watching smallishbeans 😂 awesome intro
the camel's ears are so cute!
I'm so excited about this boat base. I feel inspired
this is such a good episode the fishing shenanigans are so good!!
Note for dripstone: If you are trying to drop dripstone on someone use smaller stalagmites they do more damage
this is all about fishing people
<3
Gem really learned a lot from Grian's Secret Life shenanigans
Goodd video ❤🎉
Fishing Rod: (exists) Hermits: *"COMMENCE   Y E E T"*
The lama head reminds me of winnie the pooh while she’s riding it😂
Anyone else want to see gem start a prank war with doc?
18:24 that's perfect reaction I was waiting for, omg she's high, but seriously in the sky  she's high. 😂
hmmm fishing rods and elytra's....
30:25  "i dont know if skiz has any signs" skiz has, in fact, about 2000 signs
I have not laughed this hard in a long time. the fishing poles...
gem is fabulous
Watching this after grian’s episode, this is comedy gold. Especially with gem feeling the need to prove that she can mlg😂😂😂
Haha! Gem will watch Impulse do Redstone here 2: electric boogaloo! 27:42 Love to see the soup group back at it 😆
You should make like 5 boat design and scatter them across the server to have a base everywhere
I love this pace of the hermits, everyone enjoying the early game and just playing normally
The silly goofies of the hermitcraft server is so joyful. I love it so much. Messing with Fishing rods is so silly
I never knew fishing was so powerful as a weapon.
That poppy was your downfall
when she tried to clutch after grian fished her a flower got in her way XD
episode 2 only 3 days after the first one? insanity
"you are going to see the void!" Grian so giddy to be flung into oblivion is such a happiness boost
The first video was so good so I can’t wait for this one😊
I love the chill vibes your videos give (not counting the hermit shenanigans, but we love that bit of chaos) so I think I'll add you to my hermit watch rotation this season  ...this does mean that I'm watching ALL of the magic mountaineers though
You need to get revenge for the signs
Glad this season got off to a great launch Gem!
I can’t wait to see Skizz’s honey wall
I don't have enough extra time ta watch everyone every upload, but I try to watch all the episodes 1. Usually I pick a few hermits to watch and watch a couple of the other hermits they interacted with.  Also, I want to see someone with elytra get launched by the collective fishing poles as a take-off
I think I'm done with HC. This level of aggression on Demise is just unfriendly. These aren't clever kills. These are people setting traps to destroy items, and directly attacking and cornering players.  The idea is supposed to be being clever. Not being a bully.
Gem Is Great!
That launch was like a Mach 5 rocket! So crazy!
30:08 that is 100% a joel sign
"I am not going so make some elaborate TNT trap" *fails one dripstone trap* *immediately crafts TNT*
Both stuck in the hole after the murder attempt hahah
GeminiSlay is like BeetleJuice. Chant MURDERCAMEL three times quickly and she appears. It's dangerous, however, as there aren't any sandworms. They can't shrink her head, but they can shrink her entirely with the generic.scale command whenever that command goes live on HC
gem! of all people you should know to look out for things trying to kill you while you're fishing, i thought you were theming off of dredge
This feels like old minecraft youtube and I'm absolutely living for it.
if it was this all season, id be thrilled. this is the kinda shenanigans i love
How grian did that is if you rejoin while fishing you get another fishing rod if it doesn’t leave your hand, I’ve gone up to octuple fishing before
When I heard gem say it’s just gem  I started singing/saying I’m just gem
Did it fail because she try to water bucket the flower?
Gem made me go binge watch gamers play dredge to see where this boat came from
The fishing rod launches were amazing
This episode reminded me of what makes HermitCraft enjoyable to watch. The fact that its a group of friends having fun
And thus the Hermit Space Program was launched!!
I did not know that you can stack momentum with the fishing rod, that is so wild ^^
19:17 i actually shouted out "you sent him to build height"
When you have the resources you should have one of the elven boats from last season visiting your bay.
The fishing was priceless, I now need someone to make like a target range that measures how far each Hermit on the hook travels, and trophy for farthest distance lol.
18:21 this is acc insane I’ve never seen someone fly so far from a fishing rod 😭
“Press the record button, Pearl, if you haven’t already.” Such a great villain line. 😂
22:21 Etho S bomb????
the fishing rod slingshot is the best thing I've seen in my entire life
some needs to chage Skiss's sign to "The Skiss Mark"
Ahhh i got "spoiled" on how you died cause of grian  first episode
Before you read it out loud, I thought it said gem is adorable, not adequate.
Hermitcraft S10 is amazing. it brings me such joy watching everyone have so much fun interacting with one another.
30:41 soooooo be the signchanger gem
actually loving this season so far and I'm also enjoying how the life series has brought out the sneaky chaotic side of everyone lol can't wait to see what else is in store
That's one way to greet a new member. Launching him to the moon and become a star with the wackiest stuff in Hermit style 😂.
the fishing rod shenanigans is sending me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The hermits being launched was awesome!  A minigame is waiting with that mechanic!  Fish in a barrel!  Launching your teaates into barrels that are worth more the further they are. Thatd be so much fun. Love this fishing arc and a fantastic new start!
So I really like ur plans for this season but I have one question will u be terraforming all the grass like what pearl did last season since u wanted to focus more on terraforming
reakky great video gem
Hc: *Figures out how to reach orbital velocity with a fishing rod*  Grian: DO ME DO ME DO ME!!!!!!!
THEY SENT SKIZZ to ORBIT!
Clearly GemniTay was quite the catch. ^^
its double life all over again
What really noticed on the rod incident is that the gem wanted to idle it whenever it happened.   She actually attempted it, but the hitbox of the red rose probably affected them putting it down.
18:22 CATAPUUUUUUUUUULLLT ZOOOOOMMBEEEEEERRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTR
Always love the Gem watches Impulse build a farm :D Also the sign is a very Joel thing to do. I definitely think he's the one who wrote it LOL
What an amazing season. So many good laughs
Gem; I don't want to use TnT... Gem when her reputation is on the line; I have gun powder and sand... 😈 never change Gem... 😂
Pat of the mountain part of the crew. Part of the mountain part of the crew.  Who will be the Davy Jones of Hermitcraft.
HEY GEM nice water bucket clutch!!!
Gem should build a giant squid this season! Potentially attacking a boat but even a chill one would be super cool!
I would’ve named this episode: fishing for friends. Just with that hilarious segment alone.
I loved the parts with you guys yeeting eachother with fishing rods 😭
If you watched Grian’s first episode you know what’s coming.
i LOVE this season's shenanigans already
This was such a fun episode it felt like it flew by
fishing rod rocket launch could definitely become a hermit team sport
Me watching the whoe fishing rod bit... "God I've missed the god its been a LONG time since hermitcraft was this good"
Hermitcraft space agency!
Poor Pearl! Five against one 😂
I wanna play Minecraft with you so bad 😢😢😢
18:17 - 18:27  Me: double life flashbacks
The fishing rod shenanigans made me think: "Yoinks! AND AWAY!"
Gem to Joe at the beginning, like a kid showing off a new trick in front of their parent:  "Did you watch me jummmp?"
I absolutely love how you made a reference to the beginning of Season 9 where Impulse builds a mob farm and you watch. ❤😂
it‘s cute that you‘re worried about destruction, you really should go watch the first demise😂😂
GeminiTay: we should make a game or something out of this...  Me: A religion you say?!
25:43 32 levels 25:46 none 26:28 theyre back
gem, not to make you play favorites, but if everyone on hermitcraft releases a video at the same time, whose are you watching first?
I want to see the fishingrod slingshot after getting elytras.
I'm loving how in hermitcraft 10 everybody is less get diamonds make megabuild more detail everything and take time! I love the megabuilds but I just love this as well. its different
Oh my
Putting a mob head on a note block to play its sound is a vanilla 1.20 feature but it only works with that mob heads you can get in vanilla unless you have the datapack
This was such a fun episode, I was cackling at the people getting launched by the fishing rods. I also love how fishing just seems to have become a Thing in this season's early game. :D
He’s High?!?! 2:01
💯
Someone needs to make the “I’m in the trees I’m in the breeze” meme with grian and his fishing rod
OMG, this season is off to such a good start!!
I just wondering what Hermits gonna do season 10. Well i see, nothing else that fishing or fishing another hermit. Yea, what wonderfull season is come.
A potential for using the fishing rod idea for something fun on the server: Competitive team fishing high jump. Basically set up a wall with measurements and compete to place a block the highest. One player on each team gets a block and a water bucket, the rest of the team fishes them as high as possible. The team to place their block the highest AND land safely wins.
What a lovely episode! I really enjoyed seeing all this interaction and cozy vibes. It had me laughing and just enjoying the entire thing.
poor gem, got done so dirty by grian.
2:54  You don't have to say “Aye Aye.”   *╲‹𝆳 ⏒ 𝆳›╱* ⋮ You have to say   *_“A Y E   ! ! !”_*   *𐒨⁽ ≖൧ ≖ ⁾𐒧*  ⋮ As we learned in Pirates of the Caribbean. ⺌‹´'⏒'`›⺌
Grian's fishing skill: Level 100
Love love this episode!!!! So much fun!!!
Somewhere in a birch forest there are two signs. Both have a similar story, stuck in the sod for a stolen diamond. It’s part of gem’s hermit origin, itll be here forever lol
Gem: Talks abt how great she is at water bucket clutching Grain: Launches her into the sky Gem: Fails to land water bucket 🤣  I love ur vids
18:18 yeet!
So stoked for the new season; love the starter build, Gem!
haha, this episode was awesome on so many levels
Let's Hermit Go!
What level are you mining on Gem? 5:52
You got rekt by the flower you landed on Ooofff
Why didn’t you use your fishing rod on xsuma!
I'm having Season 5 flashbacks with all the fishing this season
So much fun, loved it
So would the bay be called Gemini Bay? Or be called Tay Bay?
Oh the flower didn't let you water bucket. Poppy betrayal
This is genuinely already my favourite season of hermitcraft and it's only been a couple of days. But dang, it's just SO much fun! All the shenanigans, you all being so close together, the random obsession with fishing (which I love too) and generally taking it slow just makes it feel so much more familiar, like the way I myself tend to play the game. I do enjoy the epic megabases as well but this kind of stuff that's just you guys having fun is absolutely 100% what I love most about hermitcraft.   Also thanks Gem for being Great and introducing me to hermitcraft - I started binging your season 8 over a year ago and then  started watching a lot of hermits during season 9 (you're still my fav tho hehe) and now I'm here loving every bit of watching a season "live" from the beginning <3
Yessss another episode
Grian sticking that was amazing
this is the best birthday present ever !
FisherGem was Fishing Fish then got Fished by FisherGrian like a Fish
I feel like it’s gonna be so fun this season to see all of the cherry blossom mountain gang merge their ideas as they expand around the area and how their different themes kind of intertwined  So excited 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
this was soooo much fun! 🤣
Or there is always another remake of the free fall mini game of trying to go through all the hoops you could try fishing rods on that but the consistency would be rather hard
NEW EPISODE YAY
Okay here me out team parkcore... but you have a section that is slime blocks, and you fishing pole launch like this makes it extra hard and it would be really interesting with precision
everyone ganging up on you to change the signs is karma, for ganging up on pear, how dare you do that
"You dont really want to explode someone's base" someone should have told that to cub before he blew up all of scars items hahaha
this is a genuinely hilarious episode- love it! and the bay looks like it'll turn out really well :3
Gone fishing taken to extremes this season. A fishing competition would be an awesome Collab, 10 points for a hermit, 3 for treasure, 2 for fish, 1 for junk.
Idea: Set your language to pirate speak for this season because you have an ocean/water theme. I'm kidding of course that would be awful. Maybe one episode as a joke.
Gem:basic tools,  also gem : *diamond pick and shovel*
I love how this season has started out, where everything is a bit more relaxed and there’s an emphasis on player interactions. I’m so excited to see what happens with Magic (not magical) Mountain. Hermitcraft is at its best when the hermits are having fun, and I hope this season can achieve that!  Anyways, I’m loving Gem’s new aesthetic for this season! I’m super excited to see what she creates.
There was a sign that got changed once, in season 6, and it started a civil war.
this was such a good mix of chill and chaotic lol
I feel like this season, everyone is taking it a bit slower, and I quite enjoy it. Everyone is taking their time, valuing the saying "chipping away bit by bit is better than doing it all at once" and I feel as if no one will get burnt out quickly like this, it's just very calm and I love it
The fishing rod shenanigans had me dying 😂😂😂
The fishing rod stuff reminds me a lot of Double life shenanigans when they fished the warden
11:55  Gem: "I wanna murder somebody." Cleo: "I get that."  😂
The organic shenanigans are so fun! Thanks for showing these here in your episode :D <3
Well now someone NEEDS to make a team minigame and see which team can send their member(or maybe just a random villager) up the highest
Scar’s dainty little “oh💅✨”😂 Hermitcraft is really cheering me up after having 6 teeth pulled🥲 Thank you guys for being the funniest people on earth!❤ And I think I can speak for all of these amazing Hermitcraft viewers, that I and many others are honored to be watching this season of Hermitcraft😊🥹
Saw Grian's perspective on the Fishing Rod Incident already and the outrage in "You fished me?" still got me again.
Everyone fishing together was great lol
Grian's laugh has something super villain to it
Gem and Grian are the definition of a sibling duo and you can't change my mind
"I'll pretend that I wanted it" Sums up my life
21:33 Grian is now S+ tier.
:D
23:22, One might say he's HOOKED
I think a lot of us also watch Hermitcraft while strip mining, and I'm so happy you said that!
22:14 Someone definitely accidentally yoinked him when he was above them
OMG i could not believe what noise the squid noises would be. Its so surprising OMG OMG 6:04
loving the new pace, take your time, it means we get ore vids per season of happy Hermits!
30:44 The true cost of being great 😞
Fish Society.
Fishing in minecraft my seem boring but it's the wait and anticipation for something good
Watching taraforming. Is oddly satisfying, I love i, it inspires me SO MUCH ❤ ❤
The signs - It's not just you. Didn't the whole civil war in season 6 start by a changes sign...
Geminislay with the TNT minecart trap!! :D I love how everyone's taking it slow and enjoying the early game, and the fishing rod combination power is so hilarious!!
im so upset you didnt get to win. Im not like angry or anything it was really funny. I was just hoping youd win. You or pearlo
Gem, I recently revisited a minecraft world from a few years ago that I'd started after watching your old Legacy videos and it's like a mini city/town/village and I'm trying to make all the buildings feel like something people would've built as they're settling into a new land that they've gone to and it's just all so cute and aesthetic and I love looking at it on a map and I'm just really glad you inspired me because I'm having such a fun time
What do you think would happen if pirate Joe met hermet craft season 10 Gem?
Proud of you! ❤  You've come so far since I started watching (2020) and you deserve every bit of success you have got.  Thank you for making our days with these amazing videos
You and Grian should be fishing "partners" this season ;).
If you had let X pillar up and then knocked him in three more times, he'd have no space to dodge
30:45 You are Gem'nough!  😂
Give a hermit a fish and they will eat for a day.  Teach a hermit to fish and they will commit a murder.
There was something fishy about this episode.
the moral today :  water bucket is never be friend with the shield .
So many attempts to off X and only the trap one was effective but it wasn't even the intended target. LOL!!!  Also the fishing rod launcher looks fun to do.
Can I just say the bucket clutch didn't work because they were the freaking poppy flower in her way! That's probably what pissed me off the most. It was the flower!
The joy in grians laughter when he succeeded, he is like a playful child!
I think the Space Fishing Program shows exactly what Hermitcraft is all about: wildly spinning a bit out of control from murder into a minigame that still murders, and laughing uproariously all the while.
I wanna see the fishing rod thing again when y'all have elytras and rockets!
Demize, getting enchanted through fishing- this season is really in the season 6's spirit
poor Gem, Died by Fishing rod...
10:54  Your aKILLeez heel.
Gem, this episode was GOLD. I was laughing so hard the entire time. Seeing that you guys are really enjoying yourselves and having fun together makes it even more pleasant to watch. I'm absolutely loving this season already
That first attempt with X was really good Gem!  The rocketship fishing pole launching was AMAZING!
when you started over towards stress on a camel just after the clarification that deads can help reds i was thinking the murder camel might be back and was chanting "murdercamelmurdercamelmurdercamelmurdercamelmurdercamelmurdercamelmurdercamelmurdercamel"
also easier access to lvls?   iskall has a skelly farm right by your explosion hole.  im sure you could use it and get bones and a better bow cheaply.  love the idea for a base this season so far.  i like the fishing vibe.  everything has been super fun to see in the early times of the season with all the hermits.   and lol of the signs
Ep 2 already!!!!
Commenting for the YouTube algorithm.
Yall really did pearl dirty
lmao those fishing sling shots were amazing.  especially the etho fling.  was amazing.  i laughed so hard
Hermitception: Me watching Gem mining on Minecraft as Gem watch’s other hermits while mining on Minecraft, while mining on Minecraft.
Ngl this is my favorite season 10 episode ive seen yet. Great video Gem
My bf and i just about died during the fishing rod transportation scenes. Lmfao
Gem not wanting to destroy anyones stuff.  And then there is the kill on Scar where he lost all his stuff hahaha
This is my first time watching ur video and oh my ur voice is so cutie patotie in vids :)
Until this video I thought Cleo and Stress were the same person
I’ve been smiling so much at all the hermit interactions, loving this season so far!
impulse and gem are perfect
This is my favorite episode of the season, so far. So many shenanigans!
Grian: Wait, I bounced! (Proceeds to die anyway) Classic Hermitcraft
The League of Fishermen roaming about, making fish fly 😂
did you know a good passive way to gain ex isa giant cow frm and weat plus you can just build 30 by 30 wheat farm
Should add a little pond next to the zombie spawner so you can still fish whilst waiting for zombies to spawn
I haven’t laughed this hard at a Minecraft video in so long. The fishing pole launching was amazing.
I’ve been rewatching the fishing rod scene so many times
Grian fished the fisher fishing fish
Gem: I am basically a fish Me: Favorite line so far XD
I like the slower pace!  Idk if it’s on purpose. But it feels good
you could start changing other peoples signs :P
I’m gonna say it: Gempulse is a thing
Has Skizz landed yet?
Hahaha soo funny when grian had 2 lol😊 15:20
A new episode of hermitcraft is always exciting (๑>◡<๑)
Someone should make a (mini)game with the fishingrod feature
Tbh when gem started to make longer videos, the vibe faded away,sorry 😔. Old gem's videos were too good to watch.
The “GRIANNN!” Peak sibling behavior
Heck if you need a good mining video all you need is docs first episode that's over 3 hours of mining I mean you should have like a billion Diamonds by then
Yay GEM!
You living in close proximity to Grian is a perfect recipe for hilariously chaotic disaster...
Bruh, the fishing bit, has me in stitches 😂😂
The idea of watching hermit videos while mining is a really smart idea, just so you’re mostly up to speed with what has happened.
Really great episode, just what we needed! Good collaboration, taking it slow and avoid burnout. More of "friends playing minecraft" please, this is great!
the part with x 😭😭 equally funny and sad
I see the hermit rocket program is progressing nicely
25:45 best Gem quotes!
Gotta Love A Ruthless Gem
Dang. You guys went all lord of the flies on pearl. Scary!
The water bucket clutch didn't work because there was a flower in the way.
You can make a multiplayer game where a team of four has to be on a platform and one of the team members Hass to get launched with the fishing rods and whoever gets further wins
A fun navy fact for ya: "Permission granted" is the correct lingo when someone requests permission to board 😂
Skizzes Crack!
Of all the things to happen during demise, I did not have “sending hermits into orbit” on my bingo card but I am SO here for it!!! There has to be a way to turn that into a mini game!!!
"He fished me, he actually fished me. I am basically a fish" is BANANAS
I’m loving everyone’s hermitcraft videos their amazing
Absolutely loving every moment. lol So much fun!!!!! Love your face. :)
this is probably my favorite ep i’ve watched this year lol!! it was so funny!
Imagine five or six people charging at you with fishing rods
That exchange with xisuma was absolutely hilarious. Major wile e coyote and Monty Python black Knight vibes going on there.
The trap for Iskall reminds me of his death in the first game of demise
Yes another person who realizes the true power of fishing I've gotten some insane books from fishing some being books with 6 plus enchants the most recent being on a friend's realm which was efficiency III unbreaking III Protection III and since it's bedrock I know how to bend the world to my will and dupe items
You live in Canada!  We have actual strip mines in the tar sands areas.  What you did terraforming for the bay was strip mining. Please stop calling gallery/branch mining strip mining.  Usually, you make me hugely proud we share a nationality, and normally I'm easy-going, but you are so awesome, it's jarring when you make this error.  In return, I promise to do my best to not mess up NFL culture, and learn from my mistakes if I do.
21:40 should be a Zedvancement.
I’m new to Gem’s channel (literally came over from grian’s episode one) and I love how slow paced and calm it is.
I’m curious Gem, which Hermit do you watch first? ❤
I feel a lot that this was a pvp kill on pearl. Sure not with a sword but with the same mindset.
i approve of the hermitpult hahah
And thus the Hermit Space Program was born
11:53 that's a perfectly normal response to "how you doing?"
You have to play the long game with Grian.  Bide your time for revenge.  Great episode Too.
You are now officially a Stress killer.
The sounds of heads IS vanilla :) or at least will be @GeminiTay
I have actually been thinking of this demise game as hermit life. 20:00 Damn. I remember when like 5 people killed the warden this way in dubble life with like 2 hits.
im not surprised you watch hermitcraft lol. i kept seeing you in the comments of a few of the videos i was watching
Etho afraid he sunk Gems boat  by letting water in XD !!! Is what i believe !!
i think what happened to those weird stances with the fishing rod was lag, someone pull must be got delayed a lot by lag, making Grian bounce, and pulling Etho down
Geminitay is not fine it's gem is great might as well get this ball rolling again
Gem…. When you said you weren’t red anymore it said you were red😢
The fishing rod segment is like the one moment from Double Life but WAY better. If only Joel was there.
The way my jaw DROPPPED when you all used the fishing poles on skizz
Episode 2 already????? You're spoiling us, Gem! We love to see it!!!
New death message: “Etho hit the sound barrier.”
You should own the sign thing. Start placing signs everywhere with positive affirmations about yourself.
Gem, I believe the reason you didn't get the water bucket clutch in the beginning was because you landed on a flower. I could be wrong, but I don't think you can clutch on one.
Next season JonnyRaZeR should join
Gem is AWESOME! One of the best catches from Hernitcraft 🙂
I’m pretty sure “got ‘em” is textbook cubfan. (Tcg card too) Unless Joel wants you to think it was cubfan, but you were on to him the whole time!  Gem is great.
1:01 we all knew what was happening, and we were all waiting for it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
GRIAN BOUNCING LMFAOOO
Nothing quite like digging a big ol' hole, is there  (And nothing quite like the friendship of making your friends fly XD)
I died laughing at the Fishing Pole scenes. Who knew that was the answer to space travel all along?
That slingshot at 18:12 made me LOSE it  I am LOVING these episodes, you all are hilarious
The new seablings grain and gem?!?!
that awkward moment when you're stuck in a pit with your attempted murder victim and he's getting increasingly exasperated as your attempts get less and less effective over time
i have been waiting for a new ep... LOVE YOUUUU"!"
Some savage murderage there.
Dude. If only the poppy wasn't there 1:10.
Watch this video on 2x speed it wont disapoint
to get an instant kill you have to have at least 8 minecart with TNT.
Life series is for getting all their murderous tendencies out
I love you guys you're like college kids when you get together it's so funny
I would start changing other people's signs as revenge, but that's just me. Can't wait to see how the bay progresses!
grian making all those harpy fanarts count, man really soared
Nice to see the Hermitcraft space program coming along strong
I didn’t expect everyone to start flinging each other with fishing rods🤣🤣
What a delightfull episode :3
I'm thinking if Gem wanted to do something extra cool with the bay, she could move the bay up in altitude so it's a couple blocks above the river, build a little natural wall between it and the river, and have a little waterfall running over the edge of the natural wall into the big river, and maybe dig a big hole in the bay as a natural spring to feed the bay or something
poor poor stress monster LOL
poor stress lol
If only that flower wasn’t in the way. 😭🤣
in most of these interactions(especially w Grian and Etho) Gem radiates exasperated lil sister vibes and i luv it XD
You weren't kidding about ep 2 coming close on ep1's heels! This is all so fun, I love all the Shenanigans y'all get up to. It's okay Gem, YOU'RE the main nautical hermit to me
Love how the tail end of the video is "Let's see how far we can yeet our friends into the air!"
You could do a "fisherman's launch tower" thats a tower next to a boat launch. Then have a bunch of fishing rods and roof platform in the tower and landing targets/range markers to launch hermits at. Team sport game, winners get fish dinners.
Need to get water bucket king Bdoubleo100 on those fishing rods
Grian clutch God (he doesnt need elytra to fly😮)
Jim is great❤
This fishing thing could be turned into a game where somebody has to shoot a target launched into the air
Nice to see the hermit space program is making progress.
You should edit other people's signs too! Spread it around, make it a trend - just like you did with fishing.
Oh man you were SO close to nailing that water bucket clutch!! 😭 Grian is lucky lol.
so it was you who got Stress if you watch the start of her ep2 it shows her dying to your trap
thought demise 2 was no-pvp? fishing hook based murder seems like it’s a grey area on that
I love how bad of an influence Cleo is on people. It's been so fun seeing all the shenanigans this last week!
Absolutely loving the new season, everyone sounds so energized, and everyone taking it slow and keeping the interactions frequent is sooooooo much fun :)
I don’t know if you caught this and I don’t want you to be demonetized but some one said the f word at 19:22. Love your videos and can’t wait for more
could watch gem dig a bay for hours tbh
I'm loving all the small little things even up to your skin this season. The over all vibe is so happy and wholesome and I'd just like to thank you for bringing something good, something funny, something beautiful in to all our lives. Thank you so much Gem! Ever since you joined hermitcraft like four years ago you've been my favorite hermit, and that's coming from someone who grew up watching hermitcraft since season two. :))
All the fishing shenanigans are so funny, Hermitcraft 10 has been so great so far
I’ve had a rough couple of weeks. This video brightened up my day a bit
Gem video?? drop everything and watch, of course!! LOVED all the shenanigans, one of my favourite parts of watching people play with their friends is seeing them have fun and having fun with them!! what a fantastic chaotic start. sounds to me like someone deserves to go on a sign-changing spree...
I’m getting very Pirate Mermaid vibes this season since you are now officially a fish lol 😂 🐟
Grian is so good at fishing that Gem became the fish
You can tell this group are friends, standing around flinging each other into the air with fishing rods and probably laughing so hard about it that your side starts to hurt. it's just stupid/hilarious fun. of course now that fishing rod skill needs to be tested by xisuma on his test world to see if it scales and what are the height limits.
Ya gotta wax your signs gem!
wHOs tHE sUPEriOR FishER nOW?!?!? -grain
The fishing rod part is the reason to watch Hermitcraft!
Lmao poor pearl got swarmed by the mob
iskall should totally join the life series tbh
This start really has been the Life series haha
19:13 Not how I expected the Hermitcraft Space Program to happen, but a welcome development for Hermit-kind.... LOL
For flooding the area you should seek out Etho's help with his ice trick
Gem us honeycomb
that was a great interaction with X :P
Someone has to make a minigame out if launching players with fishing rods this season!
.
Was it that flower that prevented your water bucket clutch?
17:18 that ladies and gentlemen is called bullying 😭😂😂
Gem: “I can do a water bucket clutch” Grian: “so you’ve chosen death”
Fishing shenanigans were not on my HC10 bingo card but I am here for it
Grian’s is one of the best most manic laughs on Hermitcraft.
If anyone was going to start a Hermit Space Program, I would've thought it would be someone like Doc or maybe Cub, but when I saw that you guys were using fishing rods to launch people into the stratosphere, it made sense that Grian was the ringleader!
After a very long time a video that made me laugh but also smile for a very long time. Thanks for this content, I enjoy it very much
ironically it doesn't get much more Dredge-like than dying while fishing
I feel like a game could be made using fishing rods and elytra
You could turn the fishing rod launching into a challenge mini-game.
You need to have a target game with the fishing pole glitch thing. Launch people thru a hole in a slime block target...
my brain is still reslly secret lifey so this is nice to see things not as secret lifey
Gem and her emotional support Cleo
I think if the person being launched jumped at the right time to momentum would be added.and if one person does not unhook until the launched moving past them they are yanked back down with all momentum.

You really need to periodically "decorate" Iskall's base with diorite and birch logs.
Team rockets blasting off again,,,,!!!!
Joes skin trows me off😂
I'm really enjoying these type of videos so far, laid back and super fun seeing the other hermits interact as well, and getting to see more of the progression is nice. I malao really enjoying all the 2nd channel content we've been grtting from the hermits
I forgot to comment this on the last video because I got distracted, but Gem's little boat is so cute!! I'm so excited to see what adventures it's going to go on :) Also, I feel like I haven't seen Stress and Gem interact a lot in the past seasons, I really hope they hang out more this season!
Gotta start waxing the signs! Make them work for it, haha.
heyyy i watched this intro be recorded live on Joes stream
haha I was so glad when I saw this episode start with the bucket clutch because you can see Gem and Joe organising it in the server chat at the start of Zedaph's livestream and I really wanted to know if she landed it
That while fishing group thing is what i love about early season hermit craft.
the fishing rod "bouncing" is from someone pulling them when they're already above them so it pulls them down quicker and makes it look like they bounce
10:10   Even Canadian murderers are polite.  lol
@GemIsGreat hey Gem loving the videos. Just wondering if you have considered having a raised/lowered lake with locks connecting them?
Loved the vid
The size of that hole from the explosion...HUGE! Gem says, "It's not as bad as I thought it was gonna be, to be honest"...lol
you should make an xp farm disguised as a lighthouse to go with your boat
New hermitcraft episode already??? Gem I love you
"fell off scaffolding"? I don't think I've ever seen that message. It reminds me of "fell while climbing" (i think) from a purge server I watched years ago when a bunch of people were climbing ladders on a sand pillar and someone broke the bottom one and like 11 people died.  Also can you imagine doing that with an elyra? Do a no rocket challenge/race where you fling each other into the air with fishing rods then start gliding.
Hey gem just wanted to see how is Winnie ❤❤❤
Never realized some of the block breaking effects sound so wet and gross when you speed them up! Got a kick out of that
Poor Stress
fishing gang fishing gang fishing gang
Grian using a fishing rod to kill you wasn't a trap..it was purpose pvp kill...isn't that not allowed???
This episode feels so hermitcrafty 27:30 was so cute, love that you guys just hang out. Ah, the vibes <3 so happy Hermitcraft is back!
I love Gem more than fwhip, but imagine fwhip doing this bay
When grian said 'do me! Do me! Do me!' he sounded like a five year old who wanted to be tossed into the pool
"well, I am a murderer"
"Why do you have two?" "YOU SEE IT TOO?!"  I freaking died 💀
Love the fishing rod shenanigans, I've never seen so many fishing rods being used by so many different hermits at the same time I'm also so happy that most of the hermits have decided to take the early season very slowly, just enjoying little things and each others' company. It's just so cozy and warm and nice
"I wanna murder somebody!" "...I get that" :D
Great work as always, love watching the early game
gem is absolutely brutal as reaper. in other words, it's just business as usual for her lol
L , o , l , this is the first time i've seen jim build in like a flat planes with everyone else
i watched Grians video first and this intro made me giggle
you are worried about blowing up base or resources? Ask scar, he got his entire 1st episode base resources blown up by cub's trap.
“the only thing its gonna harm is iskall” oofda
I was so sure that you were going to win Demise.
The sign with 'got em' sounds like bdubs to me
The launching with the fishing rod was genius my husband came home and I showed this to him his mouth dropped while I’m sitting here laughing
Might just need to wax your signs.
your vids always make me smile :)
RIP Cleo's op curse of vanishing rod
If witches in Minecraft ever needed a voice actor... GRIAN IS THE MAN! heheheheee
That fishing rod catapult was the most entertaining and funniest Minecraft thing I’ve seen in a while. What a good episode.
L o l I love traps I am very chaotic I can sneaky
I found this channel through the last secret life. It brings me joy,
9:00 😂😂😂😂 thus interaction and pleads
That whole bit with X and the dripstone is SO good 😂😂
Cleo could have high-fived the moon! XD
I love the micro base so much!
that tugboat is just fanastic! love it!
Grian being the PM and saying when everyone needs to do better when reeling their fishing rods is great. I feel like he gains more confidence in it after his clutch water bucket placement haha
It seems like the hermits are enjoying it, but personally I hope that game ends sooner than later... it's not all season is it?
I watched the Pearl kill on Cleo’s stream, amazing to see it again
what do you mean episode 2 already :O
I wonder if you can detect if sign is being edited and make it into a signal... So you can place a strategic sign and prank someone with a sound of tnt explosion on a noteblock or something... Sounds like a good carma
Love how you can actually SEE one of Grian’s missed fishing attempts to the left.
If you wanted to trap Iskall, you should have just buried an observer inside a diorite pile.
Is gem cured now or not  idk how this works
If Gem is a fish, would that change her from GeminiTay to PiscesTay?
You need 2 squid heads and 2 note blocks setup on a Redstone clock and make the sounds of a propeller for the tug boat
Hilarious
Didn't know you fish people... that stuff was funny. Can't help but think that was a bit unfair to pearl though.
Some fun interactions and shenanigans is everything a perfect episode needs.
22:00 clay Hermit Shooting anyone?
Ngl, you guys need to make a shenanigans minigame later on called 'The clutch hutch' or something lol
Shields man, the both the savior and bane of everyone
Really liked how this episode felt a little slower paced when it came to the hermit interactions. The first episode was such a whirl wind and it's so much fun seeing everyone hangout and be silly.  Fishing becoming the new big thing was Not on my bingo card (/j /ref)
Can't wait to watch everyone's pov for the fishing yeet now
Gem making the Dredge boat has inspired me to actually finally start playing it.... I can't stop
I thought she would start the video killing Joe in the same way Grian killed her haha
gem i thought you joined the life series in secret life, not double life????????????????
Genuinly curious, why would anyone NOT want silk touch on a shovel? ;o only thing you'd get without silk touch is dirt and flint
i love watching hermitcraft while i strip mine too lol
Pretty sure that makes you a fish. Underwater base?
cleo and gem my favorite chaotic duo :D great episode wooo what a fun watch !! :D
Gem: "I wanna murder somebody!" Cleo: "I get that. 😌"
Etho: Washed up Gem: Fished up
The hole fishing thing seems like a fun mini game, have people in teams and they have to do parkour this way.
I just love how chill X was when you tried to murder him lol
I would classify that as a pvp kill.
Dear Diary: Today I witnessed the launch of the Hermitcraft Space Program
I love watching Minecraft content while playing Minecraft. It's so cozy and fun.
I love Xisumas reaction to his attempted murder.
Fishing rod shenanigans are my favorite!!!!
SPOILERS:           Pearl has 'avenged' Gem by killing Xisuma using a stalagmite trap, just about an hour ago on stream. Powder snow outside a portal, above dripstone.
Gem is like a mom warning her child stress that she cant open the present before crismas because is explosive(literaly)
Okay so what's with Joe's skin
gem dies on flower cue insane grain giggling
Gem u could be making a little octopus friend that comes out of the water and then it is trying to take ur friendly boat hut😁
I love a group project
it will be funny to see the hooking from gem's view lol X3
Hearing all this laughter amidst the excitement of a new season brings absolute joy to my soul. I sincerely love the group interactions and season ten seems feels like it's going to be vibrant and jam packed with fun.
I guess season10 is gonna be all about Fishing and Sea Life now lmao😂. Where's Lizzie when you need her LOL
gem that head noteblock thing is coming TO vanilla minecraft in 1.21
She landed that MLG bucket- why did she still die? It was really funny though how she calmly just scrolled to it
14:25 Grian is the Devourer Of Cods xD
Skizz got flung so far he went out of the render distance 🤣🤣🤣
Noooo she was so ready with the bucket too!!!!!! I think Gem may need to wage war on flowers this season, because that flower started it!
this was my absolute favorite episode everrr
Scar: He’s High?   This will make it onto Hermitcraft out of context easily
i LOVE gems positive energy
This marks the beginning of the hermit space program
Thanks for the episode Gem!
That view of Cleo YEETING. I couldnt stop laughing OMG
'I wanna murder somebody" Cleo:'I get that.'
Absolutely loving all of the hermits hanging out
22:14 Etho got a 5-star smack down WTH
gem wasnt in duoble life ss she had to live it in hermitcraft
I hope you keep up the paste you are going and put out videos! Looove them one of my fave hermits ❤
How to combat signs being changed, you put honey on the sign and it locks the sign so it can’t be changed.
13:52 that is the best glitch I’ve seen in a while
Gem: Be the other hermits' changed signs you want to see on the server.
From a sailor, your control room/ bedroom is actually named a “bridge” in the shipping industry. I don’t mean to be a annoying.. just a fun fact, have nice day :)
I vote for a "Fishing Hermits" contest.
Gem is Red for a couple of minutes, and immediately joins a gang of murder hobos.
I'd love for Gem and Etho to live near each other and hang out. Love em both.
YOU DID THIS TO STRESS???
super fast grass breaking sounded like the salmon noises lol
I want a Cleo and Gem team up in the life series after this😂😂😂 bravo gem!
Love this season so far! Your video was definitely the best way to start my morning, paired perfectly with a coffee <3  I really love the theming you're going for in this season, as well as how casual and how paced you're taking progress. You're doing great gem! There's so many of us that love every second of your season so far! Thanks for sharing your experience on the server with us, I greatly look forward to the next episode<3<3
you know it’s a good day when there’s a gem upload
Gem might want to study up on her nautical terminology. 😅  The Noteblock with mob heads is a vanilla thing. It's coming either in the next update or version. Can't remember which. 🤷‍♂️  The fishing together is so wholesome! Also, it's nice to see as many people just ignore it forgetting all the cool loot you can potentially get.🎣   Stress is now a cat. 🙀💀  Last season early Gem drained the ocean, now she's putting it back. 🌊
My ribs hurt so much from the attempts on Xisuma's life.
omg i love that you almost clutched it!!! Didn't even panic at first, just switched to the water bucket and nearly got it if not for your shield!!! Also omg burst out laughing when you tried to kill Xisuma the 2nd time akjdshf
Are the dripstone working..? Have seen it go straight through people without them getting hit like 3 times at this point
Maybe I've listened to too much Great Big Sea, but I'm totally here for the boat, fishing, and terraforming the river into having small coves and bays. Can't wait to see more!
That bit where you tried to kill X was so funnu
What a fun episode!!  So funny.
Fishing rods really are the gift that keeps on giving 😂
But gem really is great! That's why you need the signs to remind you. Lol
You think that Minecraft trap was too harsh You should of seen the original demise trap for doc
I love the slower approach :3 it’s nice to not rush
watchingg thiss in thee philippines and its already midnighttt
Flying cod
we stan gem so much
Love how everyone is staying early game, and just appreciating that part of the game.  All the fishing was such an underutilized part of the game and am so happy seeing the Hermits  embrace that even if its just a short term thing.
Wow! I never would have guessed Gem for the TnT trap! And it worked! True proof this is hermitcraft and not the life series lol
The whole fishing rod sequence had me grinning ear to ear! This season is shaping up to be a great one!
Hi love your video
I really loved seeing all of the social interactions this episode! :D
who would have guessed that fishing rods on players stack
Gem: Pleaseeeeee dieeee! Xisuma: ... No 😠
A new game has been invented. lol. Who can fly the highest and survive. =)
Hey
the reveal to everyone doing fishing is hilarious
You very quickly became one of my favorite hermits after you joined in season 8 and this episode just continued cementing that. Loving the season so far, can't wait to see where it goes!
You can wax a sign to make it uneditable
Woha I just saw the first episode and you drop another one! Love your stuff
This this good 👍
The way Stress got blown up was dynamite!
Gem was playing Minecraft, Grian was playing fortnite
30:25 you can lock the writing on signs with honey like copper
Episode two already? Yay! 🎉🥰🫶
Etho and gem ❤❤ so eveytime you go into your base you are always wet 😂
The bit with X was so funny- good try Gem!
😂❤ the dolphin tried to warm her
32 full unadulterated minutes of children learning about gravity with the use of fishing poles AHAHA i love this episode so much
Tssk, tssk. As a proper fisherwoman you should know it's "reel her in" not "fish her in". ;)  But that was so funny. Thanks for a cool video. Can't wait for more.
I now know why Stress's second episode started with her dying to a trapped chest and her own curiousity.
Poor Pearl! That's straight up bullying. xD
I wonder how many hermits it would take to launch a Warden with fishing rods?
gem is great!
It was the bloody flower hauhauahauau
The amount of hermits being neighbors and also just generally basing close together lowkey warms my heart, It's like it's impossible to avoid cool interactions
If I were Pearl I would be BEYOND pissed off. That was really, really, really uncool. This isn't Secret Life wth guys? 'let us have a bit of fun' Than gang up on the already dead people.
You are now Gemini Jones
It was such a fun time seeing the Hermit play that slingshot fishing rod players part, as far as I remember it was popularized, I think it was  Last Life when Etho boogie kill Goodtimewithscar or at Double Life where they did the same thing, for killing the warden. So good !!
NASA going to start using fishing rods after seeing this
You should go change someone else’s sign in the next eps
Yep. Grian and Gem are CHAOS SIBLINGS!
Gem, you're saying you're bad at traps, but I watched Secret life and you might be the only person in 5 life series to make a trap that actually works
Can't wait to see the VOD where they're doing the fishing/yoinking shenanigans.
Woah woah woah spoiler alert for skizz, at 7:50 his name is grey..... that means he got a kill on someone at some point.... can't wait to see who it was
its only been episode 2 and theres already so much death and chaos 😂
is it weird to say that I'm in love with your voice?
This episode is pure fishing and death lmao— pearl literally flew 😭😭
I love your videos (and totally agree that Grian stole your brand, how dare he, with the fishing)! I was thinking that on future projects that are similar to your terraforming one, it could be cool to show the progress from above. Especially on such a scale, I think having a POV over the whole area could help contextualize the project for the audience. I love your work, so happy to see lots of collabs, and I’m looking forward to seeing how this season will unfold. Thanks, Gem <3
Welcome to the Hermitcraft Space Program
I ment grean
whoop... hole there... that got me
5m34s in, no that is not strip mining.
Gem and X just staring at each other after she tried to kill him was so funny
I got Dredge and I’ve been playing it like crazy. Thank you Gem for introducing me to this great game.
I so so love these start of seasons episodes, and especially now that so many of you are taking it slower, really digging into the slower moments and like.. countless hours fishing (fish or each other)  Also i may or may not have bought Dredge because of this, oops XD
Always good to watch a gem episode!!
Gem watching Impulse making a farm is my favorite bit, like, in general on Hermitcraft. Glad it keeps happening lol
There has to be a fishing launch minigame. Have 2 teams trying to launch their teammate high into the air where they waterbucket clutch onto a gameboard and tally up the points in the end
Wow, Etho's armor vaporized when he hit nothing! Like when Doc killed Scar with an arrow which flew through nether. He had diamond armor, then BAM! Vanished with everything on him
Great is so naughty
HALLO GEM
I thought the mob head on the note block is vanila. The mod is just the drop rates for mob heads are better in hermitcraft. Am I wrong?
Love your videos ❤
WEOW IF IT WASNT FOR THE POPPY ON THE FLOOR SHE WOULDVE WATER BUCKET CLUTCHED!!!!!?!!!?!
CHANGE EVERYONE'S SIGNS!!!!
That was great. I enjoyed every moment of it.
Spaceprogramm on the hermitcraft Server 😂
25:45 "Well! I'm a murderer!~" Gem you don't just say stuff like that with so much glee-
Hello Gem! Where did you get your profile picture, did you draw it? did a fan make it? Was it made using an ai generator? As a digital artist, and a pro GeminiTay fan, I’m really interested! ❤
13:56 the ravings of the insane
I think the Hermitcraft fishing rod space program is the funniest thing I've ever seen! 😂
maybe grian is trying to go for a dave the diver brand theme to compete with your dredge brand
1:12 and that's why you should never have something you right click to use in your off hand when doing a water bucket clutch
Mumbo definitely has those mixed up. He starts out with a structure, realizes that the it isn’t on the ground, then adds a terrain.
Gem is great
Looking at what Grian did. Scaffolding should collapse when hit by an arrow. We need to lobby the developers.
It's so funny to watch them fly - I can only imagine race-car sound effects as they zoom up.
I'm so excited for your builds.
That's awesome Gem you watch other hermits I wondered if you all watched each other's videos
Was not expecting Hermitcraft to have a space program this season.
It’s so much fun watching everyone have fun together. Also, you and Cleo plotting murder is wonderful.
Such a cozy episode!  I joined in season 9 so it's the first start of a season for me, but I'm so glad hermits take it easier now~
the fishing rod scenes are SO funny, between skizz becoming a star, grian bouncing, and etho being slammed back into the ground, its all just absolute gold LOL
Gem watching Impulse building farms will never get old
watching thiis episode at 12 am, philippine time! it is such a really great episode yet again! <3
back to back episodes ....yayyy
GLORIOUS!
The hermit space program
Love the fishing arc
can you invite me to the hermitcraft server
As a Grian watcher that water bucket was so funny lmao
I love the beginning of hermitcraft it’s so fun.
The reason people sometimes didn't go as high with the fishing rods is because touching scaffolding slows down your momentum by a lot 20:53
Grian and gem having a sibling rivalry over fishing is great The starter area is like a huge family with cherry bell mountain in the middle :)
I wish I could enjoy an SMP like this! :(
I think you've managed to find the new fastest way to travel in minecraft.   And it's hilarious.
you shoudlve dumped lava in the hole when xisuma was in it!!! ik its mean but your a reaper, reapers are mean 🤷‍♂
Lollll I saw that intro on Joe's stream, I was wondering what that was for!
Getting to watch the fishing shenanigans live on Cleo's stream was incredible
Minigame idea, hermit clay pigeon shooting. using fishing rods to pull, and firework rockets in crossbows for the burst damage
OMG
Hiiiiiiiiii
Hermit Kerbal Space Program
Grians kill was so cool!
Gem, I love watching you so much! Your voice and your personality always make me feel better when I am feeling down.
Theory of what is the prize     whoever wins the demise will get to choose what to build And Everybody On hermitcraft will build it together
It is kind of ironic that Gem was killed by a fishing rod while fishing tho. Saw it on Grian's POV first, was quite disappointed, but you had a good run!
Every bit with Grian and Gem is absolutely hilarious. Fishing foes LOL
Nooooooo Griannnnnnnn 😭😭😭
I love the data pack they added that makes mob heads change the noteblock sound! It’s very cursed lol
was anyone else trying to find when grian launched her up into the air from episode 1?
The whole fishing rod sequence is so funny oh my gosh
you and ethos friendship is super sweet ^-^
I can't wait to watch this! I have to eat dinner now, but i'll watch it after!  after watching this video: * I have a huge stitch from laughing *
For once squids are useful
HERMITCRAFT SPACE PROGRAM
Etho older brother Grian middle brother Gem younger sister
W GEM!! HOW ARE YOU UPLOADING SO FAST LOL! Or is time just going so fast for me…
LMAOOO THE FISHING  Hermitcraft season 10 is going to be the best hermitcraft
grian at 19:36 : do me, do me, do me💀💀💀
"OoOoh! Wow!" I think that's how we all feel when watching Gem to anything. <3 (SO glad you posted i was WAAAIITTTING for the next episode!)
Poor Pearl, she surely did not expect that
I love that Dredge is your inspiration for your Season 10. I loved that game and you making it your theme reminded me that I have not played the Pale Reach DLC yet, so now I am going back and living all the Eldritch Horror again!
Hermitcraft space program
I love how gem made another murder team 😂
hi geminitay! love your vidios
🦆
You should change your skin to a ghost pirate
I'm in my binging hermitcraft era now
Gem is really living up to the “Gem is great” sign with that water bucket clutch
the kill on pearl got me laughing :D
I really like how everyone is taking the start of the season really slow and adding small details that are missed, like adding something at the entrance of your mine for instance. it feels like an actual settlement, realistic, if that makes sense, it has an actual purpose in terms of a visual story.
<33
This is me new addition x
That flower did you dirty
You could use a sign to stop the water from coming into your boat every time someone enters. (And you'll give the hermits some more signs to edit)
Gem's failed attemptings to kill Xisuma were soo fun lmao
geeeem!!
Canadian Reaper "Please die!"
He's high Scar - 2024 Hermit craft season 10
Did you watch cottage core king while you were strip mining 😂
For awhile I was really out of inspiration and motivation for playing Minecraft, but this season got me back into it! So happy 🥰🥰

Hi
Loving Etho and his “permission to come aboard” 🇨🇦 🛥️
5:49 How love how Gem is a Hermit but still watch Hermitcraft as a fan ❤
I saw that clutch on Joe’s stream! I was so confused lol. I’m enjoying this season soooooo much so far <3 Especially you guys, the fishing crew? Magic mountain? Cherry plateau? Ocean guys? We need a name for you all, haha

Wait so white names can kill other white names? I thought they were supposed to be peaceful.

Under 10 minute gang
i’m excited to see what this season becomes and though I haven’t watched the video yet I just know it’s gonna be a good video!
oh wow i don’t think i’ve ever been this early
ahhh, so it was you who set the "iskall" trap, wonderfully executed sadly it got the wrong person lol
LOL GEM SHOWING IN THE BEGINNING HOW SHE CAN WATER BUCKET CLUTCH CONFUSED ME SO MUCH BUT NOW I KNOW WHY
the casual interaction with gem and etho? i'm living for it!
4 MINS EARLY WOOOO
GeminiTay? More like GeminiFilet, amirite?
I hope you included Impulse reacting to you sending him Vine yesterday on stream Gem! :D
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I always wonder how Gem could build so perfectly and gorgeously..but seriously gem, i LOVE the season already because i know that your gonna build a bunch of masterpieces!
1:07  *You just got Grian’d*
hihihi🙂
If she dies i die.   Update!:she died 💀
I love Gem videos so much she always gives me so much build inspiration and she’s just so positive.
Its soo calming to watch you gem!
I’ve been waiting for this! I wanted to know what your demise death looked like from POV ever since Grian’s video.
2 min gang
Hiiii
yeahhhhhhhhhh keep up...<3
YAYAAYAYAY GEM GEM GEM, SEASON 10!
IM EARLYYYYYYYYYY YESSS IM THE 313th VIEW 🎉🎉
Groan was so lucky that the flower was there as otherwise she probably would have made that clutch (Been corrected was the shield not the flower apparently, thought you couldn't place water on flowers)  Didn't realise what the autocorrect had done to Grians name until i posted it, it's funny though so I'm.gonna leave it
I have seen someone build a huge pink tree and then live inside it  Do it it will be cool
