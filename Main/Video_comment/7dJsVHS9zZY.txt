Biden impersonation was awful.
FJB 2025.😂
I dont think i even heard Biden speak this much during his 4 years
When Christopher Walken almost cracks up ya know it’s funny!!
No
1:23 back of the ladder
Has got to be the stupidest skit. It made me remember how incompetent he was, lol. Dang I can't believe America put up with that just because they were Democrats
It's like they didn't try to get a good Biden impressionist. It's not funny. It's not even trying to make fun of the obvious. It's boring.
that laughter track of a woman was awfully close for comfort
4+ years of a fake, senile "president" and that's the best you guys could do?
NBC knew it then!!!😮
Chevy would have fallen from that ladder. I'm glad Mikey didn't. They say Chevy used to get really hurt doing all those physical stunts. Sometimes I admire the commitment to the bit, but I don't want them to get hurt!  Edited to add: Michael Longfellow plays an excellent creepy dude.
Reminds me of fire Marshall bill. In living color jim carry
Good skit. It was hilarious ‼️‼️‼️😊
Walken comes in and destroys!!! What a legend! Love that guy!
Even with Christopher Walken saving this skit, the Biden impersonation was too bad.  The Mike Johnson ladder joke was great though.
Walken feeling awkward about stupid "Hello" joke makes it even funnier than it should be.
I need more cobwebs
No sketch can go wrong with Christopher Walken!!
I wonder if Walken still needs more cowbell?
He reminds me of Tim Conway on Carol Burnette shows   lol
shmell.......😁
Wow,the ladder is sutch a giveaway
This is actually a pretty bad Joe impresssion.
4:28
I thought they would make a joke about Biden low-key enthusiastically saying, sure I’ll take a sniff of those feet! 🦶 How did they miss that! 😅
Joe wishes he could move like that.
Fake biden god66
disgusting!
Jesus is Lord.
Jim Carrey had a better vocal imitation of Biden than this guy
I'm not trying to be a contrarian, I'm really not but, aside from Bargatze, that opening was really lame. I mean, c'mon, if you're not going to put your full effort into showcasing your guests, especially one like Mr. Walken and if you're not going to exploit their talents so as to put on your very best show maybe you shouldn't have them on...because I'll bet you that SNL needs Christopher Walken a lot more than Christopher Walken needs SNL (If I'm wrong about that please don't eviscerate me or try to bully me into the corner with some kind of "insider intel" or cubicle-kung-fu statistics gleened from the pages of the National Inquirer, after-all, I'm just as uninformed as the next guy and who can believe anything nowadays, anyhow?) It's just that, I've watched him do his dance routine from "Pennies From Heaven" a thousand times and seeing him now, older and doing bad sketch-comedy with an uninspired cast and crew is distressing...painful...depressing...he was the GREEN GOBLIN!
Mikey Day is nailing it! 😂
Lamest ishh iv ever seen
Mikey Day is the best biden so far
Am I the only one getting little Nicky vibes😂😂
Only a legend like CHRISTOPHER WALKEN  would get that long of an ovation. Why this man never hosted again after 2008 is beyond my imagination.
Are you allowed to joke about the great leader?
I loved the skit I just don't understand why they were portraying Biden to be 20 years younger?
😈🏆🏆🏆Instant✨️⚠️✨️Classic🏆🏆🏆😈🎬
Sounds more like George Bush.
3:18 Longfellow would be a great pick for the next era of Weekend Update. And even sooner he would be a fantastic sinister game show host like Bill Hader was during his tenure.
why dont they make fun of biden like they do trump?
Only the first part was good
Apparently Mike Johnson never “legally” adopted his son Mike, he just kinda started taking care of him when he was 14. And it’s true he did compare it to the “Blind Side”. Definitely not strange at all 😂
SNL SURE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE HORRIBLE BIDEN IMPRESSION
The bit about Commander attacking secret service personnel got me good.
Watch the Italian Skit. Y’all are out of touch. Licking Chi’s Boots isn’t Funny. It’s Sad. Y’all have the same news reports as CNN it’s both a Joke.
3:01 michael’s so cute 😂
"Some of my closest friends, are ghost." LOL!
When liberal SNL makes fun of you,  you're no longer useful to the party.
Even sketches of Biden are worse than Trump sketches.
The only reason I watched this was for Christopher Walken.
You're speaking way too fast and clear to impersonate Biden..
Everything in the new Britney book lmaoo
Awful. Where's the mumbles? It could be done tastefully, but in a way that doesn't make it painfully obvious you are making leftist propaganda at the expense of comedy. #legacy
Its not as PATHETIC as Obiden... and pisses me off more than makes me laugh!
Schmell my feet 😂
😂 the same thing Kevin Spacey in jimmy Fallon
total shit
That is so cool, everything was perfect
Hint - you have to dumb Briben down about 60% more for an accurate impression.
holy shit this is terrible
Not funny, cancel the show
Funny they give him such softball jokes. But perpetuate unfounded criminal claims on Trump. I mean come on, we cant make fun of his sons drug use, use of prostitutes, illegal lobbying, etc. Now that would be funny.
Boo back booer!
this used to be a beacon of comedy TV.
The Biden imitation falls short: it makes far more sense than Biden does.
Walken is something else. Love him.
Wort impression ever, more mummy, more lost, more pedo
Only SNL can make Joe Biden not funny.
Yeah his portrayal of Biden was a lil too coherent. He forget to shake hands with ghosts and talk to desk lamps in the Oval Office. That and start to talk then trail off mid sentence and walk away. Also crime isn’t down the only thing that is up is cost and inflation. Worst president to ever get elected in the history of America.
Joe Biden knows how to pull down women's underwear. After all he rayped Tara Reade.
Joe Biden knows how to pull down women's underwear. After all he rayped Tara Reade.
Wow... Christopher Walken is 80... I hate to see my favorite actors getting old.
The acting is awful... just looking at cue cards and reading? SNL has really gone downhill.
god love this man
OMG, I have wanted to hear Walken himself say this Halloween  poem ever since Kevin Spacey did his classic impression of  Walken,  lol! Now I can die a happy woman! 😊👍
I can't believe this guy got his start spoofing David Blaine on YouTube and now he's one of the best cast members on SNL spoofing the president. Bravo and well deserved
extrremly funny if you love tunnels wiyh soiled dockers
Resident joe biden
And Trump was bad😂
Can we talk about the one female laughing, who if not laughing practically by herself, you can still clearly hear over every other person in the CROWD! lol  She is quite obviously deep throating the microphone like a CHAMP and still able to laugh out loud!! Impressive! LMAO!   You really start hearing her around the 4:56 mark and it just gets worse and worse! lol
SNL is terrible and so is this clip.
This would be be funnier if it was in any way funny . . . and not full of lies.
Walken deserved better material.
This is so bad. Who watches this propoganda bs?
Chris Walken is a gem man! 🤣😂
"Brainstorm" (1983) is the best!
poor mike johnson didnt know what he got himself into
Half the time he turns into doing a Bush impression
The dude on Gutfield is way funnier. Kyle sun Ivan is way way more funny
And writing is not funny
Not a good impression
Crime is definitely not down
This was desperate & not funny at all. Just to protect him. Actual footage of Joe is funnier than this.
I'm glad the kids got to see Christopher Walken, a nod to when SNL used to be funny. Of course, for Halloween, nothing beats David S. Pumpkins.
Chevy chase would have fell off the ladder
Christopher Walken: “The-“ Audience: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAUEUUEUWHHSHJDJAJJFBQJDB
It's so good to see Christopher Walken. Love him!!!
Some girls laugh is super loud like someone’s recording this watching it on tv in their living room and their laugh overrides the audiences laugh and her breath is so loud
The speaker is 3rd in line after the VP.
He’s speaking too coherently.
Trump 2024   SNL = 🗑️
Trash
Hair sniffer in chief 😮
You're finally half-heartedly making fun of Biden.  That's a change over recent events.  SNL used to make fun of everybody, which is what made it fun.  The difference is that you used to be creative about it and had comedians who were actually GOOD at impersonations.  This guy's just a douche.  The Mike Johnson bit was just stupid.  None of this was at all funny.  It was just abunch of random stupid bullspit.
Why does this sound like canned laughter?
I thought "Biden" was going to fall, like the old Chevy Chase Gerald Ford cold opens.
I'm voting TRUMP 2024....TRUMP 2024....TRUMP 2024...TRUMP
Holy shit this is unwatchable. I couldn't get past the 5 minute mark.
When was SNL last funny? If you can't make Biden sketches funny, you just aren't funny.
Wow! That was just entirely awful! Just really really bad….
Snl failed. They could go so much more.  Fail
Not a good respresentation of Biden.  He is too coherent and aware in this skit.
Doesn’t look like Walken, the makeup is incredible!
He got off easy
This is just awful
Baidrn is clown alive
Welcome to LiberalWorld.  As a parody, the jokes are not even on the radar screen.  The Halloween decorations in the Oval Office don't make any sense.  There's an awkward racial swipe at the new Speaker of the House, a pathetic attempt to mike Biden look cool?    Lastly, an ancient Christopher Walken comes into the picture.  I like him but what is he now, 90?
They should do a superman parody.    Feeble mild mannered president by day, crime fighter by night.
There was one loud annoying gaspy laugh that kept interrupting the sketch
saw it on The jewish propaganda channel.
I love Christopher Walken!!!
This Liberal show is being too nice to this embarrassing idiot !
in this episode i found the monilogue the funniest but also this one
Laugh it up fuzzballs...
Biden can do a better parody of himself than anyone.  No one can create new words better than he can.
Papa pumpkin baby. If that isn't a thing in South America, it better be now!
This skit was awful until  Christopher Walken walked in.
Dumb.  SNL isn't that funny anymore 😐
Stock market is up!
This is my favorite guy on SNL, ❤
Kinda seemed like Walken trying to do an impression of Walken.
Let me smell those feet, For America!
The laughing track doesn't make this less cringe. Amazing people enjoy this trash.
For me, the audience at the end completely ruined the skit. All I heard after every single comedic line was alot of obnoxious laughs. Love that they are supporting my guy, but they were over doing it. Who knew SNL would be taking inspiration from the Big Bang Theory for how to run a show!
Christopher Walken couldn't even save that boring mess. 👎🏽
SNL never funny.
Democrats love Hamas and hate Trump!!!!!!
Papa Pumpkin 😅.... Pamela Pumpkin🎃 😅
@ this point I'd vote for Hunter Biden before I'd vote for ANY Republican EVER! ❄️🌎❄️
The take on Biden was superb
That would be awesome if they did a skit with him and his daughter in the shower! And he can fall all over the tub! Hahahahaha Hahahahaha
I remember several years ago, SNL used to be funny.
You definitely did not pull it off because biden isn't that healthy
I lost it with just Walken saying “Papa Pumpkin”.
Worst President in American history
Apparently Christopher Walken was in this sketch. I wouldn't know, I didn't make it that far.
what in who in gods name in what who is that girl laughing too close to the mic
He doesn't talk that well. Come on...😂
most surreal cold open
That was a good Biden impression.
This is so great 😂
The real joe Biden on a latter would be funnier.
When a good sketch turns into a *_great_* sketch 🥲
Have any of u guys ever heard Biden speak? Dude can’t remember 5 secs ago. Isn’t making sense like this. Nothin funny jus woke ppl tryna not make him look bad lol. L
Biden isn’t that in tact to climb a ladder this is awful
Anyone else distracted by that lady laughing, that sounds like she's crying at the same time? Just me? Ok
sounds and looks nothing like joe .this was hard to watch
The Indiana joke about the woman ramming into a building that she THOUGHT was a Jewish school should have ended with with facts, and not about women driving in the middle east.  Why?  The "Israelite School of Universal and Practical Knowledge" (the building)  is in fact an extremist organization that is anti-Israel and antisemitic.  She told the police that she hit the building on purpose after driving by it several times.  That IS the joke IMHO. Thankfully, no one was in the building, so there were no injuries.   LOL
We definitely need more cowbell!  ❤️
Was I the only one chanting kamala while he climb the ladder? 😂❤
Way better and far less stupid than David S. Pumpkins
Unwatchable
Walken was great - glad he made an appearance - the rest of the skit was painfully corny and going nowhere.
SNL isnt even trying to make jokes at Republicans expense. They are just blatantly being political. And its so one sided that its just sad
Cringe
SNL is in the pocket of Demoncrats. They mock Republicans harder than Demoncrats. I am not even a Republican, but if a Republican was in the same scandal was in they would mock the Republican. Joe Biden is an scandals and SNL doesn't mock that.
Walken is funny. SNL is not. Good luck with the crappy Biden impressions
What is the big deal about his adopted son?
Props to the makeup department on Mikey Day’s appearance. And Walken definitely is a pro at timing his lines. But as I was watching Mikey’s walking towards the ladder, it got me to thinking about Tim Conway’s “old man” character. I wonder how Conway would have done as a dottering old Joe Biden?
That’s the best Biden impression I’ve seen.
The only good part of the skit was Christopher Walken, and that wasn’t even good. Is the laughing in the audience even real?
Terrible Biden
What happened to the guy that did Joe last season? He was much better but had a lot of prosthetics they probably didn't want to pay for. Nailed Mike Johnson though.
💜Vote 4 Humanity---Vote 4 Marianne, Nikki, or Vivek. Blessings 💜
This was so cute!  Ding Dong…trick or treat give me something good to eat!
The reason their impression of Biden will never be funny is they don’t portray him like he really is.  A drooling, incoherent fool with Alzheimer’s.  Every time they make him speak coherently, the skit automatically makes no sense at all.
Was this written by an 8 year old for 12 year olds?  Just plain bad.
Did they mic Swift laughing through this skirt?
This is a terrible impression. It's waaay too coherent.
Sudakis should be the only Biden.
Mikey speaks to clearly and sounds to coherent....not a very accurate Biden...it could be funnier.
ARABS ARE NOT KILLED AND DO NOT INCLUDE this, no one sees Israel has withdrawn all troops from Gaza since 2005, there has not been a single Jew, although Jews have lived there for thousands of years and no one notices this, they just shout that Israel is occupying them Israel gives them water, energy, food, they are silent about it and no words, more than two million Arabs live in Israel and no one touches them, the world is anti-Semitic, it’s just that anti-Semitism is being implanted in people everywhere, and in America too
SNL it's not funny no more they fell off 😒
Who is the annoying person laughing?
Wow, another new poll showing an amazing lead for Trump in the popular vote.  What is going on? Oct. 30-Nov. 5 Big Village  Biden	29%	  37%	Trump	Trump	+8
The only thing that would have made it better would have been better, is having Maya Rudolph as Kamala corasing her fingers while he climbed the ladder
I don’t think it’ll be much of a surprise if Trump wins. We’re fucking doomed.
SNL liberal writers don`t even know how to insult an insulting President. Biden is the worse President in history and the SNL writers are too scared to show the real Joe.
Super Inaccurate. We can understand him and and he found the ladder. Walken was amazing though
Where was the secret service for holding that ladder? Were they out back taking a smoke break?
Remember when SNL was dangerous, edgy and counter culture? Now it’s conformist, pandering and rarely funny.
Why was that lady crying
So stupid...
Julia Louis Dreyfus should spoof Nikki Haley on this show
This felt like a Mister Rogers episode ... but for adults, repeating everything. Trying to make funny 🤪
Was this supposed to be funny? I’m shocked by two things, one that people still watch snl and two that some people actually found this funny..
See & say the farmer says: how many roses at the presidential desk?
HORRIBLE 😮
Christopher Walken was great.  This Biden impersonation was awful.
CRAZY!  JOE BIDEN IS JEWISH ... (just as Ben Shapiro, Antony Blinken, and Mark Zuckerberg ... and, look at how that works out!)  It's Hilarious! - so, 100% of course, is he acting and concluding, as he is... It's his "brother-land" and he clearly loves being around and visiting the Israeli Apartheid-Regime's Leader!  So - why not just say it out loud ... Blinken and Shapiro is UNITED, in their Struggle for the Zionists!  Even more, many points out, that the Zionists living abroad, is the most extreme ... well, include Biden, Blinken, Shapiro, etc.!! What a laugh!  And, how depressing, that US has got NON-US at the very top!! (Biden, Blinken & Shapiro, should live in Israel - NOT in the US !!! ... because their heart is with the Zionists, NOT with western democracies/USA!)
Funny how they pun him now they were licken his boots in 2020.
Oh so close to making an actual joke about Joey B. Your show STILL SUCKS!
This is one of those snl skits which give me hysterical laughter at work just by thinking about it.
That was FUN.
Nate broke SNL....for them to get back to mocking Biden for his age is crazy!!!!

horrible
https://youtu.be/0-bFpwS0B_4?si=clZ4l2-YZLIDlcM8  IS THIS WHAT THE WRITERS WERE CALLING BACK TO???
Walken is great . The other guy sucks .
That was not a good impersonation of President Biden.
If America ends up turning  to autocracy, some blame will have to go to those who chose to continue these false and needless mockeries of President Biden.  Seriously dangerous humor playing into that false narrative at this time.
He sounds like Little Nicky… terrible impression
Joe sounds like Owen Wilson
Who doesn't love Christopher Walken! Classy and a true classic. If you haven't seen "True Romance" with him, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, and James Gandolfini, you should give it a watch. Great cast and movie.
I love how the ultra wealthy (of which the top 10% of the population own 90% of the stocks) has convinced everyone that NYSE / NASDAQ are the economy... THEY AREN'T. They are the economy only for rich people.
What woman was making all the noise in the background? She sounded like she was crying during the whole skit. Yall need to fix your audio.
He sounds nothing like Biden wtf
Wow, this skit was terrible and not a single part of it was funny at all. Also, the portrayal of Joe Biden was pretty bad and didn't feature his signature garbled words and half-forgotten sentences.
Good to see snl quality still is very very bad. Cancel this show already
Walken saves the day to make an unfunny cold open better.
Stupid and unwatchable.
This skit reminds me of why I haven't watched SNL in years. Amateurish writing and poor talent. I've seen better local community improv groups. Is this the best Lorne Michaels can do today?
I love Christopher Walken!❤
Let's go Brandon
It's so bad...
This is terrific!  LOL.
So much material and this is all that SNL can do with Biden? Very lame!
Please get the trump fraud trial transcripts and do 7 nights of the exact transcript played out word for word! All the witnesses played out by SNL actors.
Still more competent than Joe.
I never watch SNL.  This skit was not funny.  SNL never disappoints
No way biden is that smooth. He should be up there talking nonsense, like Biden actually does..
Sorry but this fell flat.
The clownish president. God bless America.
Too bad looser biden isn’t as competent as this actor…
Could this venue become any more cringy?  The audience sounds like the ones on Happy Days when Fonzi walks on stage.
absolutely terrible impression.  You can understand this guy.
worst prez ever
He's nowhere near this coherent.
Too coherent.
The Joe Biden impression is bad.
No Freaking Way.. Christopher Walken.. OMG I Love IT!!
It hits even harder the second time around
Bad. Totally wasted walken cameo, that is a sin.
NO TRUMP SKITS THIS SEASON ..I WOUNDER WHY..🤔.IS IT BECAUSE YOU WILL MAKE HIM MORE POPULAR🤭🤫
snl was way better when trump was around
Lmao
They really had that microphone really cranked up on some girl in the audience laughing constantly
"unemployment is down. crime is down."  What freakin country are you living in, Joe ?!?
Two words explain this man....      HUNTER     BIDEN
"I'm third in line to the presidency so I want to see more of this ladder climbing stuff."  Mike, WE ALL WANT TO SEE MORE of Joe on ladders
Oh gawd, that was awful.
Joe Biden isn’t that clear. He can’t string five words together without bumbling words or telling a lie.
This skit needed more cowbell.
Christopher Walken is older than Biden, which is funny.  Dude's a national treasure!  We all love the guy for a reason.
Way too with it.  Terrible acting.
5:49  .... Almost lost it...
These new cast members that read every single line should be fired.
Worst Biden ever. My god.
this biorobot is an ordinary fascist, who also stole billions of dollars from American citizens..The whole world doesn't understand what he's doing..Isolate in a cage..
foo FIGHTERS!!!
Wow that is probably the worst presidential impression from snl
Pete's dad was the lucky one
Comedy of Punkie too too much paired with Pete
Har Har Har AGEISM
Does anyone really find this funny?
Probably one of the WORST #SNL openings ever. Easy #ageist humor and #ChristopherWalken wasn’t even funny.
Christopher Walken our F national treasure! 😂
The only thing Biden is good for is an endless supply of comedy
Biden wants to sniff the HAIR, not the feet. Man,. the Dems are SO out of the White House if this walking corpse ends up "running" again. he needs to bow out and endorse the hell out of someone not named "Kamala." Or else Trump will spook their dreams and days again...
Leslie Jones should be the next guest show host
Did you see all those tweets that Joe Biden put out saying they were making?  No, no you didn't.   To be fair he's probably asleep by 6:30 p.m. every day....  but still.
Almost sounds like Harry Carey (Will Ferrell) to me 😂
SNL busting on Sloppy Joe Is proof positive that the Uniparty wants him gone.
I remember when SNL was funny
If ONLY we could understand the mumbles and bumbles the real Joe Biden spews like we can with this actor!
Was this supposed to be funny? I didn’t laugh the whole time..
Christopher Walken plays Christopher Walken so well
Missed a great opportunity to make skit funny by letting him speak his normal self which is speaking Bidenese.  He was so eloquent here. 😆  And we all know he would had fallen off the ladder.  Stop lying SNL and just be funny.  😆
That was terrible
Johnsons black child he adopted and raised.  But what do you expect from left wing trash. I wasn’t an snl hater I loved it 5 years ago now it’s orange man bad and take the jab over comedy
Besides Christopher Walken this skit was garbage
The lines were wrong.  Crime is up, taxes are up, overdoes are up, gas prices are up, national debt is up, unemployment and underemployment are up, illegal immigration is up, stock market is down, national security is also down
This is the worst impersonation I’ve ever seen. Wtf SNL?
I forgot the speaker of the house was next after Kamala. Oy.
So disappointed! Where was David S. Pumpkins???????
It's only taken nearly 3 years, but the handwriting is on the wall... If Brandon has lost the MoonBats at SNL, he's lost the election.
he definitely is a joke… and makes our nation the laughing stalk…
he definitely is a joke… and makes our nation the laughing stalk…
Shmell
What happened to the other guy who played Biden
Shpell
Ugh
This is more George W than Biden. He’s be way more confused and unable to remember where he was at in a sentence.
I guess SNL has left the building  🤦‍♂️ sad
He always forgets to mention the border and migrant crisis
Bout time they started making fun of old Joe like they could the entire 3 years
Come on SNL, let’s get somewhat real. Joe Biden can’t put that many sentences together at once by himself!
Finally they're mocking this clown president.
Mikey's Biden impression sounds like Jim Carrey doing Biden lol
Damn, that's one bad impression
Commander is innocent!
Not enough dementia gibberish or smelling small children
Weak
hilarious
I thought he was dead??? Christopher Walken of course,but I understand "Weekend at Bernies" Lyin Hiden China Biden!!! How bout a skit like that??? Biden takes a bribe at the beachouse mansion in Delaware from Chairman Xi and returns the favor underneath the office room desk!!!
Shut up and support the LGBTIQA+ 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
I like Mikey Day, but he didn't do a good Biden!
That was truly awful
They should’ve had Walken introduce the Foo Fighters again
That voice he has halloween guy
This is the most coherent he has been along time
Watching the Caravan of 5000 plus ILLEGALS marching towards our border.  Biden loves it!!! Without any doubt there are Terrorists among them!’ Biden you F*****G Disgraceful president!!!!!!
Walken looking like John Cramer up in here
Was listening on headphones and thought  “That’s an excellent Christopher Walken impression”  Lol
Well it almost took them the full 4 years but hey at least they’re being slightly honest about the status of the “president”
So this was a shot at mike johnson i see that wasnt even funny
Halloween needs more cow smell
Saturday nite live is not worth watching f9e many years lame acts
John Belyshi and Norm McDonald would be absolutely embarrassed by the lack of quality of this show in these recent years.
oooof. guess SNL is in another "rely on celebrities" era... the whole opening bit was really bad. terrible impressions, forced jokes, and pointless references.  **that was my first impression. however, by the end of said opening skit I found myself searching for a story, and angry at the waste of a talent like Chris Walken for a bit that made absolutely no goddamned sense. Its insulting to Biden, Walken- and the legacy of Saturday Night Live as a comedy powerhouse.   Boooooooo current choices/ direction!! Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!
Utter garbage
😂 I still like the Saudi version of SNL Biden / Kamala better!
Biden isn't nearly that linear and coherent
It’s a long time since I’ve seen SNL and I remember why….
This guy puts thoughts together way too well to be Biden.
How old is CW
SNL used to be great - the writing here SUCKS! Of  course it does because the leftists at SNL will NEVER write anything that is REALLY critical of Biden - damn tools.
I knew he wasn't going to fall off the ladder, because this isn't Gerald Ford, and this isn't Chevy Chase, and this isn't the first season of SNL.
God I hate how they do little cutesy skits of democrats… who in their right mind thinks this economy is good right now? Why is he getting a pass? He should’ve fallen on the way to the ladder, then off the ladder, then got lost on the way out, then talked gibberish… instead he makes cute little remarks about Halloween and how unemployment is down. Give me a break dude. Every week should be another skit where Biden falls or gets lost.
Christopher walker improvising as usual
Biden’s trick or treat. “Trick or treat, let me lick your 4 year old daughter’s feet. 😂
Did the writers fall asleep halfway through writing this sketch
Joe Biden can only wish he was that with it anymore.
Meh not even close its so boring without Trevor and rest of the crew!
Is it just the lighting or has someone been using the wrong side of the ladder?! The braces look bent a bit like someone was standing on them
I remember when SNL was funny.
JFC this show sucks so bad now. 😢
Been watching clips of this one and Nate is the best guest ever.  I hope the show got great ratings and SNL gets back to real comedy.  This skit flopped tho.  Walkin saved it.  Barely.
That is a bad impression of Biden, he’s more articulate and understandable than Biden.
Still unfunny, you guys need to get back to the days when Loren bought everyone drugs.
I am surprised he didn't JOG up the ladder like Biden always jogs up the stairs. Maybe he would not trip so much if he just walked normal and held the handrail
This is a bad impersonation of biden. He wouldnt be this articulate
Booo bring back James Austin Johnson
Remove Biden from office he has destroyed america.
SNL SUCKS BIG CHUDDY GONADS!
Mikey Day reminded reminded me of Tim Conway.
Che so slow he doesn't realize snl uses him to debase black people and he sits there and laugh like a goof. That's probably the only reason he's still there is because he's willing to be cruel about his people and watch white people laugh at him, knowing he's not in on the joke.🙄 Colon married a Hollywood has been who's nothing special. Ryan was there too and he's now married to a classy lady. Racism is never funny. Che better watch himself before he cancelled next. Kenan  is funny and not low IQ.✌️
Did someone leave a microphone on next to a girl in the audience or what? Pretty distracting
Walken is such a pro
If only the real Biden could converse that well. Oh, and that impression sucked.
I’m not sure what is worse this horrible skit, the Biden impression or the obnoxious studio laffs.  Anyway Trump 2024 MAGA👊🏼
That laugh track of the giggly girl is annoying af.
The Biden impression is great but Papa Pumpkin!!! He takes the pie 😅
The day will come when we leave this world forever, please be ready. I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes Him who sent Me (God) has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24 Jesus died for you, all you have to do is believe & repent.
Far too coherent to be a Joe Biden skit...
I remember a time when an artist wouldnt have to introduce their character the second they come on stage just to make sure the audience knows "heyyy guyss, Joe Biden". The impressions from most of the old greats could actually do good impressions; the audience didnt need the explicit reveal.   Fucking embarrassing.
Hey it’s shorty
Poorly produce shows bad acting skills SNL 2018  - 2023  you cant find another Person like Jim Carrey  to your show you might as well shutdown
Did anybody ALLOW my friend Britney SPEARS to seeeee this, Chris?
LOL. I don't dig Halloween, but this was funny.
With all of the material Biden has given them, ENDLESS possibilities...they barley touch him,  and then bring Walken in to distract us.
I just realized something. I have never seen a good Biden impersonation. This one is certainly no good. I guess doing him is just too hard.
could it be any less funny....ouch
Wonderful show, thanks ❤️
Yeah Christopher Walken my secret crush from 30 years ago or more and I'm still crushing on him
SNL should do a skit on how they helped the democrats get that tool elected.  Thanks for nothing SNL
The sad fact of this video is that the majority of the audience in the studio would RE-ELECT that fossil...again!
SNL just isn’t funny anymore
This is the worst impression ever. He wouldn't have said one coherent sentence..
Idiots, he's not the president stupid SNL, Jerome Powell is the president. WTF can't these morons get anything right. No wonder the show sucks now, they don't even know who the president of the United States is! That's pretty bad and totally unprofessional!! RIP America 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Let's go Brandon
Wow!! That is what is considered comedy now!!??? Lame!!!!
Never go full walken
😂😂😂
Nate Bargatze, Dave Grohl, and Christopher Walken in a single episode!?! I'm spent.
"You can't schpell Halloween without HELLO" had me laughing so hard I got a migraine. Canonically, Papa Pumpkin is Davis S. Pumpkins's dad, yeah?
You Tube Channel : Arefin Badal's TV DRAMA : Ovisopto Bari
That was possibly one of the most unfunny cold opens for a season I’ve ever seen. And you had so much material
What crime is down? lol
I don't like Halloween because it's SPOOOky! I don't like SPOOOky things!  -- some variant of Christopher Walken
Biden climbing the ladder had me in tears.
Trump2024
Biden to prison immediately!
7:03. That’s how the show SHOULD start.
Biden appearing and Halloween go together. It is when people say,"booooo" By the way, people in their 50s have never seen the economy and lack of jobs this bad. It is the first time skilled professionals became homeless. If the economy was good, why talk about government shutdowns, raising debt cielings. and the crime us skyrocketing. If crime was down, then what is the big deal about gun control. Biden must have a split personality
So funny! He reminds me of Tim Conway. ❤
Tell me why Johnson sound like that episode of Sponge Bob being “Normal”!😂🤣😂🤣
U left out all the bribes Bidens been taking in ur skit
Talks to well. You need to forget what your saying and stutter more
Loving Christopher Walken. Not loving the missed opportunity to mention the scariest thing of all happening right now: ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate carpet bombing in Palestine and mass displacement in the DRC and other crimes against humanity and old man Biden’s complicity really top any other Halloween scaries.
I am having a laughing  "O" rn😂 I laughed so hard My hernia popped out I'm screaming Oh Oh Oh😂😂😂😂😂
People laugh at The Senile Idiot while He and His Socialist Sidekicks Tear Our Country DOWN !!!
4:30
I remember when SNL was funny
Christopher Walken? NFW!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This must be Joe Biden 10 years ago. He's not acting lost and speaking incoherently 50% of the time.
I like that joke about how crime is down..
Be more realistic if you couldn't understand half the things he's saying.
SNL, needed Christopher Walken to save their lousy Biden Skit!  He was able to get the audience to respond just with his appearance!
Weird seeing Biden speaking without subtitles
That was fabulous!
Love Walken.   Other dude is more John McCain than Biden.  Yes, I'm allowed to not like it.
This guy's impression of Biden is terrible.
#MMTLP
Not written well. The Biden impression isn’t so good.  What happened to SNL?
it’s insane how unfunny snl has been for this long and still continues
Another year of leftist pretending like SNL is still funny, because they spend most of their  time bashing President Trump. Worst Biden impression ever. Tom Shilou is the only one who can do an accurate Biden.
Wow.  Snl finally making fun of that idiot biden?
This has to be the worst SNL president impression ever.
Zionist 666 Biden
Mikey Day is horrible like usual, Walken is a legend, SNL is so bad anymore i forgot it was even on the air.
This biden can actually speak English!!!
They could do Biden jokes for years and never run out of material.
Is that Mikee day as joe
Why does the audience consist of 10 ppl
Am I the only one who thought this was super average? I mean, seriously, this wasn’t even funny. I chuckled once or twice, but even Christopher Walken couldn’t save this one. I mean, it was…boring! It was uninspired and uninteresting. There was no risk or spark in the jokes, the actors were completely forced in their anemic, lethargic movements and gestures and lines. Just sad…
Wait did his adult black son say he was only 11 years younger than him
That was a lame open.
I don’t see Joe Biden, I see a tribute to Tim Conway.
Mikey Day's Biden has really come along.
SNL should have been goofing on Biden a long time ago. He's comedy gold. In fact, he's a laughing stock.
Biden couldn't hold a thought that long.
❤😂🎉
SNL: "Let's make fun of Biden without really making fun of him." Biden has done so many things that could be hilarious in a sketch. The man's a senile buffoon, but SNL softballs it again.
Worst ever. Zero on a scale of 1 to 10
This sketch needed more cowbell.
Dear SNL,     *YOU SUCK*    Love,    the world
He has a rubber mask on like the guy that’s playing Biden
The most unfunny skit of all time
So lame.
What happen to SNL!!! You call this comedy? Its more entertaining to watch flies get zapped on a bug zapper!!!
If crime was down and unemployment was down the stock market would be up.
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN I LOVE YOU AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mikey day doing his best tribute to tim conway as old man as old man biden.
What was up with that ladies loud laugh? LOL
" D O N ' T "   🤣            😂
"I have a fever and the only perscription.....more cow bell.
I guess this gem did age well after all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvrhVjn0BOo
Horrible impression
The world is a scary place right now... thanks, almost entirely, to me and my fraudulent regime...
Am I the only one that didn’t think this was very funny? Terrible Biden…
This skit was terrible until Christopher Walken came in to save it.
I know good ole WC was a pleasant surprise, but that ladder bit killed me.
Christopher Walkens' dry sense of humor is priceless. Hope he comes back again and again.
Want to master the Biden impression? Combine Clint Eastwood and Ronald Regan (post Alzheimer's )
Imagine an impression so extremely bad you need a memorable celebrity from the past to breathe life into this corpse of a sketch. Day should say goodnight.
This sketch was WEAK!!  It's pitiful how much SNL has declined over the last 10 years.
Mikey’s Biden is actually fantastic.
It's funny when Walken is silly.
Pretty dumb reality is much funnier
SNL needs to make creepy Joe Biden a little more creepy to make it more realistic.
Shouldn't Walken have said... "It's Shaturday night!" ? :D
Mikey Day doing an impression of Dana Carvey doing an impression of Joe Biden. I like it.
Christopher Walken is an ICON
Wow they didn’t yell “live from NY it’s Saturday night” and it was actually bearable and not annoying.
They try so hard to be liberal they ran off most Americans
👏👏BRAVO - standing O for Walken!  IMHO SNL needs to reach into their deep pockets for Special Guests Stars
Bring back jim Carrey back for this
People are easily amused I see. Pathetic
At least they didn't make Walken dress up in the David S. Pumpkins outfit.
This Biden is a little more sharp🤣🤣🤣
I love that he was touched by the applause to the point where he smiled.
id like to see Jim carrey do his impression of Biden. mikey nails it here though
Tom Schilue on Gutfeld does a way better Biden.
Did something happen with the story the blindside?
Boy, that was really a waste of Christopher Walken's talents.  It was neither funny or all that interesting.
Mikey's Biden works! I'm sure they made the switch so he can talk to James Austin Johnson's Trump as we approach the election in a year
Democrats destroyed America
Joe bidens America
All this skit needs is more cowbell.
This is literally me since my stroke, lol.
Christopher Walken has looked the same for years
Are you kidding me !!!! 😂🤣😅😂🤣😅😂🤣😅😂🤣😅
So, correct me if I am wrong, the only reference to the ethnic cl3ansing of Palestinians is "wars", right? Yeah... good ol' apolitical SNL... 😒😒😒
well, that was a liberal puff piece, no biden falling, no biden not talking in complete sentences,  no biden stopping mid speech and forgetting what he said or was going to say.
Has anyone seen Mike Johnson ?.. what about Mike Hunt ??.. anyone.. anyone ??
Who is the woman we can hearing laughing like she’s holding the mic
Christopher Walken played himself perfectly. No one will remember Mikeson John after this.
Way too cognizant for a Biden impression.
Walken saved this. The rest of it was not funny and boring
snl doing  this kind of spoof just says they are not supporting him for 2024.....they  should have had newsome coming in as the ghost  of halloween future as the antichrist
Has Christopher Walken ever memorized a single line from his SNL appearances? 🤣
"a lot of my closest friends are ghosts" is brutal
snl used to be funny now they are blind and stupid
This show how the audience is fake
Hey SNL, great job bringing national and international attention to the speaker’s son who specifically asked his dad to not involve him in politics because he has a family of his own and he didn’t want to be political.
I love Mikey Day, but this Biden impression is awful. We all know JAJ should be Biden.
Chris, my man Christopher Walken, legend!
This whole skit is hilarious - I can't blame Christoper Walken - well done!  They are all (AND THE WRITERS) are great!
biden doesnt need halloween to be spooky—thank god we still have walken to save the day 🏆
Okay, adored Christopher Walken but that Biden impression was GREAT 😂
This was awesome! Wish it were longer, hilarious 😂🤣
Man what a difference when democrats make fun of their president compared to when they make fun of America's president.
Mikey Day obviously has no idea how Mr. Biden behaves. Mr. Day's performance was very clear and concise. No stuttering, no slurring, no losing a train of thought, climbs up and down a ladder without issue. I mean, if you are going to play a part, you should look a BIT into the way the person you are portraying behaves. Good thing Walken was here!
This guy iz Good!👌
Yeah, this looks about right.
This clown got more Applause than sleepy Joe will ever actually get
Christopher Walken ...he is the awesomeness of all times..may the Lord keep you healthy, safe and the great entertainment's Genius.
Love you Christopher Great ❤❤❤❤
This was a GREAT episode!!   Nate Bargatze was awesome!!!!  After watching the highlighted episode on Hulu with Matthew Perry, it made me realize that they do not put the SNL band in the opening credits anymore...they haven't in a LONG time!  I think they should....they are SO talented 🥰 @LorneMichaels   he's for sure gonna see this, right? 😸😹
The bats😂😂😂😂😂😂.  And Christopher walken👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼.  Mike Johnson and his glasses😂😂
Just....not....funny.
Christopher Walken was great but Joe Biden's impression was even greater specially when he said "relax I'm not gonna to fall" 😂
He moving too fast for Joe Biden.  Slow down like...99 percent and you got it.
Christopher Walken corpsing, send for the man!
The girl giggling WAYYY too close to the mic is hilarious
Love how they still find a way to get at republicans when we have a President who doesn’t know his first name
Was a half decent attempt
One of the GREATS❤😂
Mikey Day is great but this impression is like Joe Biden doing an impression of Will Farell’s GW Bush doing an impression of Dana Carvey’s George HW Bush. 🫤
Omg so bad
Wow why is it like they are almost afraid to do a more accurate and funnier impression. This was more like an impression of how Joe wished that he talked and acted
Mikey Day should never be Biden again. And I love Mikey Day.
And there's even a painting of Christopher Walken on the wall in the hallway.
Christopher Walken!!! Papa Pumpkin!!!
Ghosts just like most of Buyden's voters
😂😂😂Haaaaaaaay CHRIS!!!
Why did SNL wait so long to show what an Idiot Biden is . SLN is controlled
Only Jim Carrey can play Joe Biden 🤣
Needs more cowbell
That sketch was tanking until Walken entered.  They need a better Biden impersonator, a caricature that's funny, like Dana Carvey's Biden impersonation
Boo
Why in the world would they pull the adopted son into this on national television?
Not a funny skit. Had potential though
Too funny 😂
This skit needed more cow bells🤪
OMG to Funnys!! 😀😅😀 GO SNL!!💗🇺🇸🇺🇸🗽🗽
7:04 I got shivers!!!
Liberal SNL finally did a joe Biden skit….. it only took 3 years
"Weekend at obidens"
I have to be the only person to not know who the Christifer Walker is.
I miss when snl had good impressions
Jesus...a monkey could do a better impression of Biden than that.
Good to see them getting back to Mr. Robinette’s Neighborhood!
I was at a dinner party and towards the end someone suggested we watch SNL. My friend and I tried to ignore the request but this guest kept insisting so we caved. I don’t think he will be invited to future get togethers as this was painfully unfunny and embarrassing. I can’t think of a more cringe and low-brow form of “comedy” than SNL. This show has been on a weird uncancelable life support for decades. I feel really sorry for people that can’t think of anything else to do on a Saturday night than watch this affront to comedy.
Of all the years of watching the great CW I have never seen him struggle to not break character… his cameo was hilarious. love him!
Does that lady have a loud laugh or is she REALLY close to a mic LOL?
god this is worse than will forte's w and baldwin's trump combined
Some of my best friends are ghosts! Hahaha omg that’s so bad and funny
I'm sure Biden even gets a kick out of this!
I think he had a fever and hinestly needed some more cowbell
Terrible show but Walken was great. They finally take some jabs at Biden but they’re pretty lame.
He's too easy to understand
The laugh tracks when it’s not even funny. I thought it was a live studio audience.
Sounds like joe biden doing jim carrey impression
Trump 2024
is not jim carrey and that is it
this was a hard watch not funny at all
So much comedic gold out of the Democrat party and snl like all late night ignores it, make fun of GOP so the mob stays happy
Writers must be on strike again. This was 🌽🌽🌽 and lame.
Someone was laughing too close to the microphone towards the end there, you could hear her chuckles over Christopher Walken.
His Biden impression is mediocre.
I really wanted to laugh at this but it wasnt funny. And joe biden is a funny idiot.
He did great!!
wait so the SOH's name is michael jackson??? that's crazy
SNL Halloween's most famous skit, David S. Pumpkins.  Trivia question:  What were the very first words out of David's mouth?
This guy’s impersonation of Biden isn’t doing it for me… The mannerisms work and the face kinda works but the voice ruins it.
Snl needs to be canceled it can't possible find funny ever
This is pathetically sad. Our country is in ruins and we are run by an illegitimate puppet president wearing diapers. I remember back in the 1970's when SNL was top shelf. Now its bottom sewer.
I see Walken, I give thumbs-up.
Sounds like Biden and Bush Jr
So unfunny it's not even funny
Is this what passes for political satire these days. Way too soft on Biden
Papa Pumpkin is David S. Pumpkin dad!!!
Walker would have made an excellent Trump, I never realized this until now!
“You mother duckers better take this trash down. President biden is doing the best he can with the mess the last president made 😡 “     ☕️ liberalism
Hmm. A rare instance where James Austin Johnson didn't play Biden.
Skit should have included biden sniffing children like in all those vids that are taken off youtube. They are on rumble still though.
I never thought I'd hear Christopher Walken recite Trick or Treat Smell My Feet... and I never knew before how much I needed to.
Joe isn't this capable.
This opening made no sense. It wasn’t funny, none of the jokes made sense. Walken looked confused. This show is terrible.
Joe Biden is not that clear sounding. Lol
Lorne Michaels is the too old person of SNL. But also "please dont destroy" is the worst thing ever. 3 white dudes aint even on the cast just be writing non live "skits" with that dumb shakey camera effect for self flaggelating trash that is. not. funny.
This network sucks like the people on snl
I don't find ridin on President Biden's age funny, but you redeemed yourself with Christopher Walken!!!!!
Biden provides so much material, I only wish they would have been doing this immediately. People would start tuning in.
I find it hard to believe considering the circumstances  That many people clapped and cheered fo joe bidien  Just goes to show you the  Magic of tell a lie vision huh  Programming the masses
What happened to SNL?? It used to be funny. 😢
This was supposed to be funny? Good god.
this is awful
7 minutes of nothing
If you squint it’s like you’re watching Dana Carvey do a Bush impersonation
Biden can't even find the stage much less climb a ladder
SNL has turned into trash!
Biden has never been this articulate for that long... They could have also threw in something about Joe Biden being a Jewish Puerto Rican from a African-American neighborhood.
Pretty funny, for the worst President in history
Joe is probably laughing at this. Donald didn’t laugh at SNL skits of him. He just fumed and became butt hurt.
Wow. Talk about cringe. SNL is so boring and unoriginal, what kind of depressed burntout loser can laugh at this dribble? Reminds me of some weird sexually aggressive uncle who thinks hes funny when hes just  old and cringe.
This skit needs more cowbell. The only thing that was remotely funny was Walken saying the Trick or Treat line you thought was funny when you were 5. Great comedy writing, SNL. 🙄
Thought David S. Pumpkins was going to show up LMAO
The Christopher Walken fanatisism in the comments is so cliche. This is a lame Joe Biden skit and there is much better humor that could have been written. Too many spoon fed bots 😒
If only SNL writers had the cajones to skewer Biden. Alas, boring.
His Biden impression is really bad.
Biden gives you gold to work with and this is the best you can do.  Come on, man.
He looks nothing like him, and sounds nothing like him…. Like AT ALL!!
Which one was the funny one.  Love him, but Christopher Walken was struggling.
I haven't gotten familiar with this season's new cast members yet, but whoever the new is guy who's  doing  Walken, his impression is spot on!
Mikey Day makes his first appearance as President Joe Biden from James Austin Johnson in the Cold Open.  He's awesome. Also, Christopher Walken is back on SNL, and he makes his first appearance since he hosted on the April 5, 2008 episode, the ninth episode of Season 33, with musical guests Panic! At the Disco. 😄 😀 😅 👍👍
what an underwhelming skit.
The forced laughter is cringe
Schmell my feet.
Was this sketch supposed to be funny?
Ya'll need to bring back Dana Carvey to do a real biden impression. His impression is spot on.
I bet his pants were wet.
Terrible impersonation...
SNL:  Cancel your show.  You stopped being funny long ago when you couched EVERY.  SINGLE.  JOKE.  AND SKIT.  as liberal, woke, victim-based attempts at humor.  Delete your account.
Let’s go Brandon😃
terrible imitation
Nobody in the comments is talking about the Joe Biden impression. I wonder why.
That's the Cristopher Walkenist Christopher Walken that ever Christopher Walkened.
CORNY
I thought the Speaker of the House was 3rd in line to replace the President, you know cause of the Vice President being second!
Love Mikey Day but this Biden reminds me of Little Nicky lol.  Biden should be so easy, see Kyle Dunnigan.  He nails it.
Lets not pretend that Biden could talk this coherently
One of the lamest bits ever!
carey was the best biden with the shades and the finger gun
Any line that's delivered by this man is pure gold. Bravo!
You can understand too much of what he says. You can’t understand what joe says half the time. It would have been better
wow SNL making fun of old man senile dimensia alzhiemers Biden. I'M AMAZED THE LIBBYS MUST BE DONE WITH BIDEN
The Emperor of the Known Universe has arrived!
SNL has not even been funny since the early 2000's , cancel it already
Good script.  Weak Biden impression.
99.99999% of the great comedy SNL could have created about Biden they spiked because SNL has no balls.
Joe is the worst president in American history.We are now involved in 2 wars andloves to give our money to them trillions in debt but giving 100 of billions for aid but people in Hawaii got 750$ a house hold atleast they can het a week of groceries.I cant even laugh about Biden anymore.What he hasdone and is doing is going to destroy us
Hard to even see a parody of such a Corrupt Warmonger.
Mikey Day nailed it with Biden.
It’s giving Jennifer Coolidge 😂
😂
Trash bit
lol people that voted Biden about to vote Biden again 😂
Black Pete Davidson 😂
Idk man, decent impressions but SNL's political sketches have gotten soooo watered down in recent years. They used to be more direct and incisive, esp around the 2008-2012 elections. The new speaker of the house is a literal christian nationalist naz*i* and there's so much they can and should do with that
Snl has not be funny for years, they can't do funny.
They all looked n sounded as those who they attempted to look like except the Christopher Walken guy.. Whoever played Chris Walken, yikes..
the left is sadly forteiting a treasure trove of material about which to skewer biden, but they won't do it; it's not politically correct for them.
wow, did they use a plastic spork for this supposed roast of an extremely incompetent guy?
Kevin Spacey did Christopher Walken reciting the same poem years ago on Jimmy Fallon's Wheel of Impressions.
Walken made me literally cry out of laugh. One of the best cameos in SNL. 😂
I know it's a cold open but wow that was terrible.
Trick or treat? Smell my feet was freaking funny man
SNL has never been funny
Biden fights the Grim Reaper everyday! Lol
All the material joe gives them to work with this put woke non funny crap together.   A skit of his daughter hiring security to keep joe out of her shower would be funny. The joe character could come up with all kinds of whacky excuses in attempt to creep on his 12 year old daughter.
I like Christopher Walken, but Papa Pumpkin is no David S. Pumpkins.
Lord, I wish he could be that coherent for that length of time.
Biden in dangerous situations and having him scream RELAX would be a funny reoccurring bit.
A wise man had the second thought to wait til later to hang the bat at a scary place!
love it, thanks for the laughs!
Yeah, what a Fudging nightmare this CRIMINAL ACTUALLY IS! Of course, they have to pretend they are covering Brandon and his DUMPSTER FIRE policies, pussies!
Why are the pretending Joe Biden is coherent enough to form full sentences and remember where he is or what he’s talking about?
Shit joe 1000% time worse than this If you think for a second he's your president your the problem with our country.
Free Palestine
WOW THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO DO A SKIT ON JOE BIDEN THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE SNL WHO TOLD YOU ITS OK NOW ?
This was the strongest roast of a democrat president ever, despite Joe being the worst and most memeable president of all time. How pathetic and shameful from SNL, it's just a propaganda mouthpiece for the left. Even after all these f**k-ups from Biden, this is the best they could come up with.
The new cast is absolutely awful, and nothing in this skit was funny except for Walken.
SNL sucks.
My favorite part of this Biden impersonation is when it becomes a Reagan impersonation
This is so watered down. They used to be edge and mock everyone. I just watched a old man walk up a ladder. Where’s canteen boy? It’s late night, stop catering to children and people who act like children.
They made him say the line.   Perfect 😂
Mikey will cherish this skit forever. Christopher Walken!
SNL just gets worse every season.
This show is just not funny anymore. I don’t understand how it continues. Nate Bergatze is the best thing to happen on this show in years. Dave Chappell is also watchable but overall they need to cancel this mess.
They've only spoofed Biden twice ever, you can tell how biased this show is.
Anyone else remember that 9 years ago Kevin Spacey did the same Trick Or Treat poem on the Tonight Show? Search for Wheel Of Impressions Kevin Spacey.
Imagine how funny these would be if SNL actually roasted Biden instead of pandering with old jokes.
I guess nobody noticed how unfunny and uncreative any of this was.
I can't believe SNL did a sketch on Joe.I thought they were scared to death of the ILLUMINATY coming after them.
Christopher is an American treasure.
hahah it's funny cuz biden is old. hahaha good stuff snl. burp. lorne michaels is 78 and still producing the show. the show's become pathetic.
hard to think this show could get any worse
I'm very surprised SNL thought this was a good week to poke good natured fun at a man who is actively assisting in a genocide right now
Geez, this is what passes for comedy these days? Awful. How the hell is this show still on the air?
That Bad Bunny episode last week was really great.
For how long has SNL been so unbearable? I haven't watched in years but I love Bate Bargatze so I watched a handful of skits and, outside of the monologue, didn't laugh once.  How is this still on the air?
tbh feels more like Mikey Day as Jimmy Stuart as Joe Biden
Luv luv luv walkin!
Christopher Walken Christopher Walks In #thesurprisewedidntknowweneeded
Saddest fake laugh track of all time.
SNL stopped being funny years ago - But this is a good one!  If they make fun of hid'n lie'n brib'n biden more often - more people will watch!
Funny lies Crime is down,  unemployment is down.  🙂
Christopher Walken's saved this sketch
How weird, I was told SNL was unfair to the former guy by making fun of him. Yet here they are with a hilarious Biden cold open and no one is having a toddler tantrum about it.
It kinda blows my mind that they almost never parody Biden even though he's a treasure trove of material. They'd rather roll out old worn out Trump jokes most of the time. It's a shame they favor agenda over comedy.
Unwatchably bad.
wow this was painful to watch...
Protect Walken at all costs.
lame
The joke should have been 'oh no that's not a decoration, that's a mutilated arm of a Palestinian'. Way funnier.
Kind of pissed they never went back to Chekovs stepladder there.
Can’t believe they let Pete Davison do black face! Awesome!
Biden been doing to help kill children in gaza and palestine
Wow, not just a writer’s strike but obviously an acting strike too! This is just sad to watch anymore. Thought I would give it a chance, but you may want to keep those laugh tracks rolling so you can at least feel like your funny.
This skit was stupid proving that the writers still suck,the skit should have included the corruption from this 80 year old traitor and Hunter smoking up his crack,and how about some skits about Alec Baldwin going to jail for murder...the show still sucks and has since the original cast left and it will never be like it was in the 70's,it should be called SNS "Saturday Night Sucks"
Walken is awsome 😂
That’s a great George Bush impression
Second in line for the crown … why can’t we just have someone less deviant … someone not so koo koo, senile or insane.   … someone we can be proud of and not hang our head in embarrassment.
That's the funniest Saturday Night live's been in 20 years!  Thanks, we need more slo joe biden bits!
It's good to see Christopher Walken.  🎉
Still not funny 😒
Sad fact this is exactly how it is and Democrat voters don't care.  Hate Trump as much as you want, but his America was much, much better, safer - in every respect.  Keep watching this dumpster fire embarass himself.
Holy hell! Youŕ handlers allowed you to make fun of  Brandon? What happened? You've had years to do this. 😂, when the jokesters are the joke themselves. Haven't watched this shit show in decades.
I like how his version of Joe Biden is like a calcified Owen Wilson.
So unfunny no wonder snl can't draw flies completely sucks shit
🥱
Most of your voters were ghosts too...
Christopher Walken. ❤❤
Nice to see SNL writers mock Joe Bidens weakness.
Gotta have more Cow bell
The Biden piece was hilarious. And accurate.
FJB
I see the writer's are working hard to make fun of Biden,when they could've just let them write themselves with the orange loser!
👏🏾👏🏾😆 well done! 🎯
Wow.. hilarious.....
Biden never makes sense because he's senile. Remember when you guys elected an 80 year old racist man with dementia?
Someone needs to tape  Martin Luther's 75 thesis on Biden's back !   Happy reformation day!!!  the other holiday that day.  Martin Luther nailed it that day.   In latin on the Wittinburg door.  Martin was both on the same day as St Martin  who was also tried in the 'Diet of wroms'   by the Holy ROman EMpire.  Thesis numero uno -  all of the Christian life  is repentance.    The list was translated to German and sparks they were a flyin.
And as long as Hispanics continue to grow in U.S., America's security will continue to be under threat from within.
Like idk what happened to life…politics and the way they make fun of things is not funny. They only consider the feelings of democrats but act external creepy and nasty towards republicans who r from the SAME COUNTRY!!!!! Snl hasn’t been good since 2000
Snl sucks life sucks cuz peoples character sucks cuz of TikTok the phone and cuz of the current woke democrats who have essentially ruined everything in a 3 year time span
Can't say "that dog woulnt haunt'  about Commander.  It's been Halloween policies with the Biden administration  from day one as Joe haunts the White House  not all there.     This is what saving the soul of a nation looks like?   ( question  So what's the skinny on skinny dipping Joe?  and another question why would feminists elect someone who liked to swim naked in front of female secret service and pushes unfair policies making girl bodies comete against boy bodies?      Answer  question one Jesus said you shall know them by their fruits and human tracking connected,  lie addisted,  drug addicted,  tampant nude selfies,  hookers,  money launderings through LLC's  say Biden can't even save himself much less the soul of a nation.  A corrupt DNC and DOJ that enriches itself and attacks others says one poisson apple  poissons the other apples in the basket.   I can help you with how to save the soul of a person or nation or even a president:   look to Jesus and be saved.   Answer question two    Sin makes you stupid.  Come to Jesus and let him wise you up.)
Biden skits would be funnier if he wasn't destroying our country right now.
Was the first Vice President, ancestor of Jamaican slave traders, Kamala Harris shaking the ladder?
Bet a lot of folks don't know, bit there used to be a time when sketch comedy was funny!  Guess you had to be there.  Nevermind, carry on...
Maybe do Trump with dimensions. Biden has been traveling the world working more hrs than this actor! A little disappointed!
Biden isn't that coherent. Wtf You actually make fun of him while making him look better...  Brilliant
They never do a skit like this making real fun of Biden. They did the same with Obama when Rock played Rock Obama. They showed Obama, but used it to make fun of every main republican head. Here, it was more of a shot against Mike Johnson. So many things to make fun of Biden and they choose the simple ones. No gaffes, no stroking little girls hair, no looking at his watch and not caring, no sleeping on the job, no whiny noises when trying to breath, no lies about corn pop or being in the senate for over 100 years etc etc etc etc etc
not funny but i am glad they are finally making fun of JOe
You can hear a girl laughing right into the mic it’s weird
C'mon. Let me shmell those feet!
Wow that was bad.  SNL is not funny anymore.
There should be a law passed where no one over the age of 80 can elected to the Senate, House or Presidency
Is Mikey Day taking over as Biden. I love his impression but I also love James Austin Butlers johnsons
Omg. The feeble walk looked great. They really didn't hold back making fun of him
I like how they some how twisted having a black son into something racist.  The Democrats will do anything to hide the fact that the Democrats are the REAL RACISTS.
Not a good impression of Joe, he made WAY too much sense in this clip. He is far more incoherent when he speaks in real life. He can never stay on topic, doesn't finish his sentences, and gets lost on a stage. They made him look way too "normal" and "mentally healthy" in this skit.
brilliant opening , SNL rocks
Why is JAJ not doing Biden? Or Jim Carey?
You guys could have come at Biden way harder, he's undeniably one of the worst presidents your country has ever had, he gives you boat loads of material every week and you just play on the "he's old" joke because you don't want to offend liberals lol. Just come for EVERYONE like south park does and maybe your viewership will increase.
They made fun of Trump consistently and they make this guy look like he can do a long coherent sketch
These comments: omg this Christopher Walken Night Live show is really good guys
What the F was that?  Knock knock. Who’s there? Not funny.
Give a ton of credit to Mikey Day.  Snl has found its best Biden for sure.  He was as good as Balwin s Trump.😅😅😅
The funniest cold open for last 8-10 years!))) made my day!)
Some really good jokes in this Open
I'm starting to realize that the government is imitating SNL and not the other way around. Also the impression of Joe strikingly resembled Tim Conway from The Carol Burnett Show. 😂😂😂😂
Ageism is so darned funny!
When does the funny start?
Totally gre😢!
WHAT was the deal with the woman who sounds like she is laughing directly into a microphone? Very annoying.
I love Halloween... some of my best friends are ghosts.
No dancing?!!?!?!  You can't have a Christopher Walken appearance and not have him cut a rug.
Walken has recited that poem before in a movie.   I just can't remember the movie.
On Wheel of Impressions Kevin Spacey did Christopher Walken saying this poem and now it's become real
Christopher Walken ages so freaking well. He’s 80 years old, damn. Good on him having a sharp and with it kind.
The *non-verbals* of this 😂😂
Joe Biden sounded like Owen Wilson lol
Lot of My closest friends are 👻, this latter was cutting edge technology  back in His day . 😂  Christopher Walken just an Icon.
Is there a microphone in some woman's face? I swear all i can hear is one woman laughing way way louder than anyone else
Hilarious Cold Open! 😂😂😂
4:58 what’s with the crowd mic directly in front of some girls mouth?  Hearing the individual laugh so clearly is creepy.
There is some chick fake-/force-laughing the whole time Christopher Walken is on and it’s distracting.
Holy fuck. What a goddamn national treasure Christopher Walken is!
"White Dad" I want my kids to call me this from now on. Great name.
That was so funny and the snl audience there for it  was really good too! 🍁🎃👃🦶🧛‍♀️ 😂👻
Funny!
Christopher Walken is the best part of that skit.  They are lucky to have him.
They finally did what had to be done.
Terrible impression I could understand what you are saying
Why in the hell did this bit not add more cowbell?!?!?!?
Horrible impression 👎
Close, the toilet.
Biden couldn’t complete those sentences
painful
Not enough people is talking about John Mikeson.
pretty unrealistic Joe Biden considering he's not making up words... also spoke clear sentences for over  a minute...
Walken is great, unfortunately the sketch is a dud.
Biden jokes are so innocent, no porn, treason, etc. He deserves re-election.
This was stupid even it was making fun of Joe Biden
Terrible
i don't trust either of the men who were on that boat with Natalie Wood the night she was killed .
walken... alrighttttt mann.. love you bro
Walken is always amazing but this dude doing Biden is horrible.
Now this is scary
As Christopher Walken's #1 fan, I'm irritated that I wasn't told of this.
Another completely garbage unwatchable episode of SNL.  When is the funny going to come back to a once great show?
If it wasn’t for Chris Walken I wouldn’t have laughed at all.
2:00 Good, Commander. Good boy.
Thousand of Palestinians are dying due to this President's foreign policy handling but I guess SNL is too scared to address that.
THAT WAS ZERO FUNNY
They really don’t want us thinking about the genocide huh
I just hope he does not suppose occupation - #ceasefire
.......SOTHIS FREE WORLD YS OURS.......TWO TRIBES FRANKIE GOES 2 HOLLYWOOD 1986
biden is the worst president in US history, don't matter how much lunatics on the left covers it up
I love Christopher ❤❤❤ hi daddy! Lol
Who dat 😆🤣
Another epic walken skit...they all are!  Imagine your cadence being so different than the world, and it being your signature.  He is a treasure.
Did they change audience microphones for the new season? Getting specific individual laughers in detail like never before, inhales and all
What kind of a leader of states pass laws that allow everyday citizens aka shoplifters,  to just walk in retail stores and grab whatever they want, then walk out the store with out paying ? What are you trying to accomplish with such a imbecile law? And you are supposed to be a good role model for the United States? You sure did accomplish making United States of America a laughing joke didn't ya? Pretty much spitting in the people's faces. Or shitting on them.
This could have been hilarious. The fact they basically showed Biden fully coherent was weak af. Even the Indians did a better job. And then only take time to shoe horn shitting on Johnson? SNL is for imbeciles. *obligatory gop is trash, and dems are trash.
We need more DAVIS S. PUMPKINS
more cowbell
All I know is eventually the Grim Reaper will win. Come on Reaper!
This has to be the only funny and not cringe skit i've seen on this show, and it was awesome.
Joe Biden has dementia his dialogue is too coherent
Great sketch, but I really feel it could've used some more cowbell.
I wonder if Pappa Pumpkin is David Pumpkin's father?
SNL sucks. Trump 2024!
Funny how the gop forget about middle class destroying Reagan who was brain dead his last term while the gop didnt allow him to give speech's..  You talk about an old brain dead POTUS! Look up Reagan.....
FJB!
Probably the weakest presidential impersonations in the history of SNL.
I would have never known about Mike Johnson's "adopted" black son if it weren't for SNL.
Ok cold open i guess
What happened to the other guy
Is Jim Carrey no longer available to do Joe Biden? This guy is awful
Anyone else hear that annoying lady giggling in the background
I saw it. It was painful.
More of this style of sketch, please
Walken saved this cold opening
Why 1.2 million views? I was looking forward to something that was actually funny.
Some really loud stoned girl in the first row.
They got it way wrong, Biden would just be saying random words and mumbling
Meh - same joke over and over. Yes - he is old.
dear god. not even Christopher Walken can save the crap of snl.   the writers i guess  are crap.
Not funny...
I had to force myself to watch this and I have to admit " it was lame " who writes this crap 😬 would have been funny if they would have made it realistic by falling going up the ladder, forget what he was talking about, turning a sentence into mumbo and just acting like the real clown he is. 🤔🤪🇺🇲
Biden was way too present to come off
why is nobody questions why James Austin Johnson isn’t doing this sketch
Slomo Joe
Christopher Walken doing a teddy atlas impression is solid gold
If Biden actually walked in on this, it would be a boss move on his part.
Needs more cowbells!
Omfg BEST surprise guest ever!!!!!   Also, what's up with this Mike dude having an adopted son 11 years younger than him. That's really f'n weird 😂.
It was awful until walken appeared
That had just the right amount of weirdness.
I’m sure the audio guy got fired after this sketch 😅 what was that ???
too little too late on making fun of biden. should have been doing this and more 10 years ago, not just when you want him out of office
So we're just not gonna mention him doing the exact words of Kevin Spacey's impersonation of him on the tonight show that one time huh
Where's David S. Pumpkins?
Is this the best of the best? Complete pathetic garbage!
Who gave that one girl her own mic to laugh into?
I hated the part when this started.
How long until John Mikeson names his adult black son House Majority Leader?
Every comment is on Walken 😂
Dude. Spacey did the same Halloween poem as a Walken impersonation on Fallon years ago…
Who was laugh/crying right on the mic
Can SNL writers get any lazier? So much opportunity with the poem and that is what they did?!?! Maybe they need some help from AI?!?!?!
Oh how the impressions of Joe Biden have changed. Just shows how the Biden of today is a completely different person to the Biden of 2012.
One of the worst Biden impressions on television.
They forgot the Alzheimers
Why was the audience microphone focused on only one woman?
The funniest part -- "Crime is down."
Sounds like little nikky
SNL opened with Dementia Joe?!
Why can't any of these new actors memorize their lines like others from the past 4+ decades? The cue card reading is so annoying.
It’s official. More people have played Biden than Trump.
Are the writers still on strike?  This was not one bit funny.
Inappropriate considering shit in Israel. Motherfucker should b in a skit bent over in jail for selling weed to dying grandma's. Cuck innuendo humor is soo ghetto.
Awful Biden impression.
SNL has lost the meaning of being funny. Chris Walken knows.
I half expected him to do a full Chevy Chase stage dive.
“Crime is down” 😂 That is a funny joke!
Christopher Walken is the Best!! 80 years old & still got it 😂😂😂
Wow, this was not funny at all. I thought that SNL was a comedy show.
I understood way too much of what he was saying for this to be an accurate impression. 😂
Now that was funny.
Everything in the new Britney book 😂
I am so glad that you uncluded "adult son Michael". Too few people know that aspect of senior Mike's resume. Never legally adopted him because "process was too arduous"
This is the worst Biden impression I've ever seen.  His voice is completely off.
Satanists favorite holiday where they can sacrifice children to Moloch
Really??? Biden, Halloween & Walkin, and this is the best you could come up with? The writers suck!
Man I was hoping for some more cow bell.
Wow, SNL acting has gone down hill in SNL.
Alright, here me out. Christopher Walken as the Ghost of Halloween Past, Tom Hanks as David S Pumpkins as the Ghost of Halloween Present, and Bill Murray as Steve Bannon as the Ghost of Halloween Yet To Come.
Thats not David S. Pumpkins!
Getting the "King of New York," Mr. Walken himself, is a pretty big get for SNL considering how abysmal it's been the past few years.
I knew the "I'm not done..." was coming with that look from Christopher Walken 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nah Jim Carey the only Joe Biden I know 😂
Creepy Joe Biden
A ladder? SNL missed the real scary predicament... a demented old man ushering in WWIII.
You can really see the sway in politics, SNL you sound like a DNC shill, no better than Msnbc.
Shout-out to Mikey Day for his excellent Biden impression. Probably my favorite since Jason Sudeikis (no disrespect to Woody Harrelson, Jim Carrey, or anyone else who's played him that I'm blanking on)
Terrible impression of Biden. We've got YTers that are 10 times better.
Don't focus on Biden's age and being out of breath. FOCUS ON TRUMP and his crazy comments - Like Jeb being president and getting Orban's country wrong.
Walken was funny. You would think with all the crazy things Biden does they could make him funnier. SNL is a bore.
Spot on.  We literally have an ignorant bozo for the role of POTUS, who can't seem to understand that Americans do NOT want to fund Isreal's military and genocide of Palestine!!!!!!!!!
Still not funny.
Eh. There’s only so much humor to be squeezed desperately out of “he’s old”. Colbert’s impression is way better 😊
DOPE Chris Walken!!!!
Damn they knocked it out the park with this episode.
"a lot of my friends are ghosts!"  Damn son.
I'm glad that I didn't read the description before watching the video. It was wonderful to see Chris be part of the sketch!
Papa Pumpkin’s got some pull He’ll yank Joe’s diaper, no matter how full
Love Mikey Day, just not his Biden😂
Mikey was a good choice, did a great job!
I'm struggling to find anything funny about this. And this is coming from somebody who hates Biden.
People actually get paid to write this non comedy. This sketch is nothing without Walken.
The funniest thing is, you voted for him and everything that came with him.  AND, you’ll vote for him again.
One of the WORST, most boring opens ever. I believe in Biden, but watching this monologue is like watching Biden trying to get through a speech. I always wonder: WHEN IS THIS GOING TO BE OVER? Sad to see Walken read every line. Just awful.
What a pathetically bad impression of Joe Biden.
Even when they pretend to make fun of Biden they don’t and instead attack a Republicans black kid. It’s called racism.
Christopher Walken is just so cool...😅i love that guy
😂
too coherent and didn't fall
Chris Walken saved that lame opening.
Christopher Walken just stole that entire opening!! I love the way he keeps mispronouncing 'spell' 'smell', making fun of him saying 'foo FIGHTers.' Not to mention 'comma-rad-ary.'
Everyone loves Chris Walken!!!!
hhahaha this was hilarious! bring back old prospector lol
Wow, these skits suck! Just horrible, ugh!😮😢
Was that a laugh track or a real audience, b/c. … I wasn’t feeling it, but the audience was …
"Everything in the new Britney book"
It’s amazing how bad SNL is… without a walk on of Walker this would of been the most boring bit ever… there are so many funny things they could do but they don’t want to go hard…
COST OF LIVING CRISIS.....
That woman trying really hard to laugh genuinely was annoying the entire time Christopher was saying his lines.
lamest opening in the nearly 5 decades I've been watching SNL
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood....
The laughing of the babe!!!!!
LMAO dog took arm off of secret service 😂🎉n grim reaper oh my i cant stop laughing ❤😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Did someone forget joe isn't allowed within 500 feet of children
Dang Walken, looking great! 🧡💜
He's got that whispy thing Joe Biden has. He nails it 😂😂
I love how Mikey *didn't* take a pratfall off the ladder a la Chevy Chase as Gerald Ford.  "Can't do Chevy as Ford while the UAW's on strike" - - Fran Drescher
I was hoping he was going to be David s pumpkins Sr.
Finally they are doing a skit on the worst president ever.
Impersonating Joe Biden using full sentences and coherent thoughts is like impersonating Sam Kinison while speaking in a library whisper. Oh, and Christopher Walken is a legend.
Finally ,,, C.H. has returned !!! Damn Straight America
what was this ?!?
The Continental is the ghost of all Hallows past… “Hello”
This guys Biden impression sucks
The girl with the gaspy laugh needs to back away from the audience mic. Quite distracting.
i think that mike johnson and michael (no last name), adult black son is going to age well...
That's weak.
Should have used Stephen Colbert as Mike Johnson. But Christopher Walker was a nice surprice.
Papa Pumpkin is the father of David S Pumpkins, right?
Picking on Binen...   I guess it's official they know he can't possibly win.
The ageist jokes aren't funny, @Lauren Michaels.  Let me know if you and the team need help with finding new material.
Not a good impression.  He needs to rush and stumble through partial sentences quickly, like he's trying to convince a cop he's not driving drunk.  Also, not enough vocal fry and not enough stuttering. Joe Biden isn't just some ancient, feeble, one-foot-in-the-grave-one-foot-on-a-banana-peel old duffer, he's an ancient, feeble, one-foot-in-the-grave-one-foot-on-a-banana-peel old duffer who has had numerous strokes and is trying as hard as he can to convince everyone that he's a sharp, vigorous, canny elder statesman who is not a brain-damaged, senile, moribund shell of the corrupt, racist, elitist, opportunist political prostitute he's always been all throughout his entire career.
Would've been even funnier if Biden was sniffin' Walken's character! Give me a writer's job SNL.
Ugh.  Still not funny.  Who are these lazy, ignorant writers they have on SNL these days?  Who do they think the audience for this crap is?  And do they not have access to YouTube?  Can they not watch videos of their OWN shows past--some of which were sometimes funny--to see how it's done?  Bottom line is that you don't HAVE to have a Cold Open if you can't come up with something ACTUALLY funny and you don't have ACTORS who are ACTUALLY talented.  Just skip the monologue and be done with it.
I have to say this is one of the weakest cold opens that I've seen since SNL started.  Did they get a group of third graders to write this during the strike?
This is funny if you’re an old hippy liberal douche who’s just now figuring out Biden is a geriatric dumpster fire.
Two-Face Biden supports Israel’s “Right to DEFEND itself” publicly while giving $100 Million to Hamas Nazis. -supporting Pure Evil once again!
I stand corrected...this skit.was just horrible... writers went on strike again?
So if Biden put on bronzer and some sort of extreme hair product to remove the gray, like a certain someone does, no one would call him old or make fun of his age? Aren’t there other jokes and parodies that can be made of Joe besides his age over and over?
SNL got called out for being too political and going after republicans too much.  Now that Uncle Joe is office and provides plenty of material this is what they come up with?  These people are ruining SNL and what it used to be
Things should get easier for SNL as Joe Biden continues to morph into Mikey Day’s impression of him.
How do Trump supporters celebrate Halloween???  Pump-kin.
The teeth/mouth are all wrong.  Until Mikey D gets his lisp sorted out, he'll never _passably_ do impressions – unless it's of someone else with a lisp of course.
Love how decent our potus is! What a difference! #Biden2024
FJB!!!!!!!! Let's go Brandon
Walken is a treat
Please bring Christopher Walken back to host SNL
I am going to cry like a baby when Christopher Walken departs this sorry world!
They really ought to bring in Dana Carvey for Biden. He played him hilariously on the Late Show and even cracked Colbert up.
I don't always like Mikey Day but his is the best Biden impersonation yet!
Anyone else want to back Christopher Walken as an independent candidate for President? He has to be better than the last two.
I still think of the gambling den scene from the Deer Hunter whenever I see Walken.
Dana should been called to do the scene
I bet Biden is cracking up. He can laugh at himself.
Please. More cowbell. I gotta have more cowbell.
Having Christopher Walken in the scene took shine away from the Biden parody, which was low effort.
That's the worst impression of Biden. For one, he's was to articulate. However, I am glad they finally are taking shots and his inability to function.
''Hallo''
Okay brilliant bringing Christopher Walken in.. best laugh I’ve had in awhile…
Could it be David S. And PaPa Pumpkin be an estranged father and son? Or long lost siblings?
Lemme schmell those feet!
That ladder climb sure did give him an adrenaline rush 😂
Thank Gawd Walker showed up to save this boring skit!
SNL killing it on script, skits, and guest this season.
The Biden opening was in bad taste.
What poor writing.
Is SNL good again?
Pretty poor Biden impression xD
the only thing i want for halloween is david s pumpkins
Walken,  turning brown tap water into GOLD.
Lets Go Brandon! 🙈🙉🙊💩🤑
Whaaattt....? The adult black "son". How obvious can something be?   And don't tell me, let me guess, homophobic?
The Spirit of Halloween is John Kramer? The guy who is supposed to be dead, but somehow keeps coming back
Where’s JAJ Biden?!?
Was wishing he was Christopher Walken as Colonel Angus as Christopher Walken
If he was dressed as his headless horseman character from sleepy hollow that would have been epic!!!
It’s not as good as Trump, but still good
I thought JAJ was doing Biden? At the same time, I’m 90% sure that’s Owen Wilson doing him, not Mikey Day
“Let me smell those feet … for America!” YO WAS NOT EXPECTING CHRISTOPHER WALKEN 😂😂
Really bad. Must be new writers!
Walken made some kind of high pitched noise before reading the poem. It was very odd. They edited it out on this video, and probably will do so on future airings. He didn't seem like himself.
Comment section:  Christopher Walken
The skit had a great potential. They shouldn’t have hold back on Biden’s immense success as the President 😂
that sucked, not as much as Joe himself. traitor
so weird the black comedian is doing his best Pete Davidson routine. So weird. Same mannerisms and facial ticks.
The most moving reading of that poem ever.
Hilarious!!>>>Making fun of of Joe and dems are laughing.... not planning a coup..
I wish we had this biden speaking right now, what an excellent example of how Biden should talk
Walken for President. He’s the only one over 70 I will vote for
SNL is so cringe now 😭 even the fake laughs in the background. So sad…
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Biden sucks, here we make fun of how weak our leader is in front of the entire world
Biden is impossible to make fun of/impersonate bc he has no personality or charisma.  All you can do is feel sorry for him and ipso facto all of us Americans.  Biden is total Zombie & couldnt even run a McDonalds let alone the most powerful country in the history of the world.
Not Walken's best work...
Sad
It's sad that you can't tell if this is a sketch or an actual live look in the Whitehorse
Dude is a terrible impersonator of Biden!🤑🤣🤣✌
Terrible Biden
Kind of unwatchable. Who wrote this? Biden is old, has gotten old. Try something new.
This show is gasping for air.
I LOVE CHRISTOPHER WALKEN !! ❤❤👍😂😂😂
Everyone is just star-fucking with Christopher Walken--not very funny
Christopher Walken makes anything better. Fact.
WWlll- war in europe.... Middle east..... Unsecured border..... Inflation.....
Look who walksin!
SNL seems to get worse every week. Every once and awhile they have a funny skit.
Whoever was laughing sounded like Ariana Grande
I expected Tom Hanks!
I needed to take my anxiety meds with Biden stepping up on that ladder.
Why was James Austin Johnson not Biden in this one?
sort of made the connection when watching....we like him cause he is sort of like Mr Rogers....makes us tolerate the slightly weird stuff in the land of make believe
Mikey Day is great! It's ironic the SNL pups make fun of Joe Biden's age, then bring on an 80 year old actor that makes their audience go wild. Have some respect, Guys! It was funny, though, and the kid who played Mike Johnson did great, as long as his adult black son! Haha!
The legend is back
Difference between this skit and a Chump skit is- Joe and Jill are laughing and enjoying it vs Chump and Melanoma getting so salty and offended!!😂💀
Offensive. Christopher Walken, however... awesome.
That was a better Bush impression than Joe Biden
wow, I did not know about the new speaker's adult son,and that he was black...ALSO, only 11 yrs younger than him, hmm..interesting  🤣🤣
Should have got Tom Hanks as Mr Pumpkin to round it out.
Commander, like a well trained GSD can smell fear and read people's body language. Hunting all the bad eggs in the White House!! Poor pup. I'm sure he's confused, like Major was
The ageist jokes about Biden are neither funny nor pro-democracy. Why echo GOP faux talking points? Where was the age humor for dEmented Donny?
the absolute scariest president of all time
A lot of my closest friends are ghosts 😂😂
Why does that black guy look like a really healthy Pete Davidson lol
Ohhhh he’s old. Good one
Just fire the writers already.  Even Christopher Walken couldn't revive this corpse of a sketch.
Jason Sudakis is still my Joe Biden
I enjoyed the show
stop giving mikey day things to do
The low very low rated SNL sure goes easy on Joe even after he’s destroyed the economy and brought 6 million unvented illegal aliens into America, oh and the WW3 currently underway.
think I peed a little when Walken came in. A true treasure, that guy.
Love Mikey but yeesh, that impression was not good
Mikey Day’s Biden is actually quite good!
“HALLO!”  Nice call back to “The Continental” 😂😂😂😂
Reptile humor...
If Biden were a terrible president as opposed to a highly competent one, sketches about him would be funnier. Biden trying to walk up a ladder and meeting the Spirit of Halloween? It's not like the sketch of Trump at the United Nations cafeteria.
"Slave"? No that black man over there is my son.
Хватит убивать Палестину! Займитесь своими делами. Хватит убивать людей по всему миру.
If I was his son I wouldn't want to be seen in public by his followers and that's exactly why he is doing that.. you can love and appreciate someone that brought you in but I would never promote his political career
And that’s a TREAT!!!!🎃
🤣😂😅😆😁😄🤪
If only he had worn a Cowbell around his neck!
Christopher Walken is  the best!
Dumbest snl bit ever
I wish they could have weaved in a joke that includes the fact that the economy is booming like crazy. Hell, Fox news had to eat crow and admit on their monthly report. By the very standards of the GOP the economy is absolutely kicking ass right now, Fuck it if the Dow Jones took a dip. 4.9% is killing ANY economy that a Republican resided over.
It seems like there is a lot more they could have done with Biden - he's a large target for parody as his presidency is a parody.
That new up and coming cast member is really shining thru with that Christopher Walken impression. Need to keep an eye on him ...😂
Its not David S Pumpkins but always happy to see walken
Christopher would be better in that office
Christopher Walken looks scarier without makeup.
Mikey Day's impersonation of Biden will not go down as one of the better ones in SNL history.
Sad how SNL is now. Pathetic. Miss the old SNL
Biden Himself is THE Halloween Decoration of all time. How Scary !
Jesus this is painful.
The Whitehouse must be really desperate, they'd rather Biden look like a harmless senile president than a war criminal. You know what's really scary this Halloween? White phorphorous
love Christopher Walken - but now I want to see him as the father to David S. Pumpkins...
The woman laughing into the microphone took away from this.
Nothing scarier than a dumocrat.
Mikey Day did great, reminded my a-lot of Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush in Vice.
That wasn't spot-on, but that impression of Biden is a pretty good one. I actually like Jim Carrey's impression of Biden, even though his wasn't even this accurate.
Papa Pumpkin is the relative I never knew I needed, lol
Turn down the mic on that girl you payed to hysterically laugh after every word from the cast, thanks.  It's super annoying
The meatloaf reference, anyone? ANYONE??!
the opposite of funny
All the bots here talking up WALKEN ..NO POTATO MENTION ???
Was the adult son played by Pete Davidson doing blackface?
The joe Biden impersonator was speaking too coherently to be joe
Notice when SNL makes fun of Biden he doesn't cry like a spoiled child.  I guess that's exclusive to the GOP
SNL getting DESPERATE.... NOBODY WATCHING their PROPOGANDA ANYMORE...
Joe wasn’t creepy enough nor confused enough. And all his words were too intelligible.
Bad bad Biden impression, jokes were not funny either.
Not bad, not great, the Johnson thing felt forced, didn't make alot of sense with the skit. Christopher walkin was the best part
Can you schmellll what the foot is cookin!? 😂
They're really pulling out all the stops trying to make SNL seem relativant again
Christopher Walken is just naturally scary.
Christopher Walken in any skit is gold.
That was painful
This Joe Biden reminds me of Dana Carvey’s Mickey Rooney. :-)
Wow SNL really has gone downhill, so much they could have done here, so disappointing
I want to laugh at this so bad. But there's nothing funny about it. I mean, I hate Joe and I wanted to laugh at this Saturday Night Live sucks
Itz OK.  Who is the woman who has her own laugh mic?
Did they just have one random female mic’d up just to catch her laughter? The hell was that
Ahhhhh snl trying to get they're balls back.....too late commie stooges
they got mike johnson too tall , he is like 5ft 7" little guy
SNL trying to appeal to the maga crazies. Cringe.
Boy, the girl in the audience sitting right next to the microphone really liked this one.
One of the worst openings.  Didn't really find any of it funny... sorry. Glad the writers are back {sarcasm}🙄🤔
What the hell even is this?
After the first three lines of his poem, I said audibly, the last three lines, not knowing they were coming. That is too good they added them. Absolutely classic
Absolutely horrible impression. Just awful.
Great call back to Dana's Mickie Rooney!
Paul McCartney is 5 months older than Joe Biden.
Let us not listen to war criminals!
The worst Biden impression ever.
I can't help but feel the truly great Christopher Walken was deeply Underutilized here. He deserved much better material to work with.
He nailed it so wrong 😂
The Biden impersonation sucked... Sounded more like George W...
I got a fever, and the only prescription is more candy corn.
#BooBackBooer✨✌️🎃✌️✨
The voice was way off. His impression didn’t cut it.
Hardly funny . Guy playing Biden really needs to work on his voice to sound more like Biden.
That woman's gasping laugh when Christopher Walken is talking is everything.
Stephen Colbert would do well as a renfield in my opinion. Not my beansiness though. In Jesus Christs name we pray amen.
3:25 2nd or 3rd in line for presidency?… 🫣
The lady in the audience must had a mic in her face the whole way through!
Was anyone else actually getting nervous when he climbed the ladder? 😅
The actor that plays Joe Biden on Saturday night NAILED IT ❤️
Some audience member is mic'd better than the cast lol
That laugh track is haunting cause these shows aren’t funny.  They could be but writers are hacks.
That’s Christopher Walken I thought it was Mikey day?
Huh another look at this man and not me  Moment ... Sponsored by biden
Remember when SNL used to be good, instead of just political propaganda?  I sure miss those days!
Who would have thunk it to pair Joe Biden and The Spirit of Halloween aka  Papa Pumpkins aka Christopher Walken?  Build Back Better-Boo Back Booer!  The adult black son with Mike Johnson does sort of remind me of The Blindside! Answer: SNL!
This was so bad it turned good :D
the leftist propaganda show is almost as bad as trevor noah
Garbage
Agree, agree, agree.  Dems have GOT TO step up and give us another choice.  thank you joe, but  AGE AND VITALITY are needed now.  We need a age appropriate Potus for 2024.
Anything with Christopher Walken is an auto-win.
Mikey Day doing an impression of Dana Carvey doing Biden.
Michael Longfellow was the perfect Mike Johnson. However, I'm darn sick of skits whose humor relies on the notion that President Biden is a doddering old fool. I was glad this one turned to more interesting material--not a moment too soon.
That Halloween poem sounds a bit on the Kinky side🤔
Genocide* not wars. Come on, SNL.. what happened to you?💔
His impression of Biden isn't terrible 😭
Magas still whining in the comments 🤣  Snowflakes.
Two 80 year-olds vying for comedy
That is on fuckawful Biden impression.
Criminally excessive use of the Laugh track.
I’m Here For Papa Pumpkin 🎃 coming from the 🚽
Biden is a creep
Crap. As usual for the woke SNL.
Its a scary in a way that it actually true. Bidens presidency actually scary at this moment.
Day's Biden is.... subpar. They should give Austin a chance. Granted, it would prevent Trump and Biden from being on the same stage at the same time, but  still....
Wow, even Christopher Walken couldn’t pull this terrible sketch out of the mud. Is this a new cast?
I’m EXCITED to SEE more of this whole LADDER 🪜 thing 😊!
Joe is famouse at the WH for dropping f-bombs. You'd think SNL could use that too.
Biden is such laughing stock, this is spot on.
He always has 'a poem.'
Who is performing as Biden here?
Could not stop laughing while watching this.  I'd pay money to watch a reaction video of Joe Biden seeing this for the first time
Christopher Walken!
I love the game set up at the beginning of this sketch: Biden decorating ornaments while standing on a ladder. Sounds horrible, but that's hilarious. Obviously, I don't want Biden to fall, but I could have watched five minutes of will he/won't he fall and the stakes of what that means. Long story short, I loved that premise, and I always think it's a shame when a great premise is pushed aside. Regardless, this sketch needed a story structure. Either you make it about the ladder, Christopher Walken, or you focus on Mike Johnson. I found this sketch frustrating to watch. It was a mix bag of ideas with no direction.
The mic is super close to one audience member 😂😂
that biden impression is terrible
Weak.
Christopher Walken!!! The Best Halloween Treat!!❤❤❤
Awful.
Girl laughing? Who is the girl laughing?
This Cold Open is so scary it's H O R R I B L E   🎃
Why, after the bit about the severed arm, does it look like Mikey’s right hand is completely fake for the rest of the sketch? It never changes position. I kept waiting for it to get chopped off. I wonder if that was a deliberate fake out.
Christopher Walken doing Kevin Spacey doing Christopher Walken on Jimmy Fallon
This was an all time bad skit
so cringe. the anti biden ageism is such cheap trash
Why is he mixing in Dana Carvey's SNL impression of Mickey Rooney?  "The world...the woooooorrrrrllld."
This actor is more qualified to be president than the clown he is imitating.
Should have had Kamala cheering him on to climb the ladder
Not a New Yorker.  Is "schmell" a gentle jab at Yiddish?
Let’s go Brandon 😊
Anyone notice that one woman in the audience that is laughing like she is trying to not pee herself?
Col ingus my man
Papa Pumpkin is okay but he's no David S Pumpkins
You could do so much with Biden, this is a huge comedy letdown
Can someone tell that girl to stop laughing into the microphone
I was waiting for Chucky to pop out. Missed opportunity
THE CONTINENTAL!!!!
This version of Biden is better than the real Donald Trump.
GDP is 200% higher than when #45 was in office.
I think the writers are still on strike…
it's like the continental dude.
The writers at SNL need to study their CIVICS and learn the line of succession
He looks like the Juiceman or Dana Carvey doing Biden.
That camera woman laughing during Walken was so annoying... Way to ruin a possibly good skit.. Couldn't pay attention with her laughing during s*x. -_-
Mike Johnson aka John Mikeson 😆😆😆😆 has an adult black son 🤣🤣🤣
I don't think SNL is funny anymore. 😐
The "Biden is old" schtick isn't funny (he's doing a phenomenal job) but Christopher Walken is always hilarious
Horrible sketch. how far SNL has fallen
That whole son thing is true.This guy apparently to get around his religious sects restrictions on homosexuality adopted his male lover.Yeah that’s republican leadership
This was a really bad Biden performance
The stock market is up 2400 pts under Biden
Someone has hired new writers.  These guys are funny and not just pretentious liberals trying to shit on conservatives for no reason and with no jokes.
So if Christopher Walken is the Ghost of Hallows Past, then David Pumpkins is the Ghost of Hallows Present? And what would the Ghost of Hallows Future look like?
who's that girl sitting too close to a boom with the crisp laugh.  come on sound people 😂
I really needed some cowbell.
Boring
Christopher Walken has such flawless comedic timing.  He knows just how long to pause for effect.  What a genius.
And your Congress just handed everybody a gigantor bag of Halloweenies #TricksnotTreats 🎃🎃🎃   So I suppose most of us are getting in the 🍑 this Halloween; didn't want it, I'm good thanks
Reps hate when SNL make fun of Trump but as a Dem I LOVE them making fun of Biden. Trump people just don't have a sense of humor unless it's someone they don't like
Lame & predictible old age jokes , even Christopher Walken couldn't rescue this one.
Walken's old man pants
Should of had Jim Carrey come in to do  Biden. 💙
He sounds more like George w bush. Biden way slower with his speech lol
These skits used to be good. Now just an empty shell of existence..  No longer relevant. Kinda lame actually
I thought Christopher Walken acted in worse shape than the guy they are trying to lampoon....   ;-P
Is Papa Pumpkin David S. Pumkins dad?? Is this some sort of not scary halloween gang??
In this trying and hardship of times…… WE all could use a little more Papa Pumpkin 🎃
Hilarious 🎉😂
Mr. Walken was trying real hard not to laugh. He saved the sketch, too.
LOLOL!!!!! For a minute, I thought Christopher Walken was going to break character, I could see a little smile coming!!!!
Severed arm... can only think of Gaza...
I was expecting David S. Pumpkins to show up...  Any questions?   ;-P
Let’s get Walken saying, “camaRADerie” on a loop.
SNL producers and writers could have done so much more, but they hardly even touch the complete incompetence of Biden.
I thought it was Jon Voight lol
He's still got it!
Can we just appreciate that NBC gave us the ACTUAL Christopher Walken saying "Trick or Treat..." after Kevin Spacey imitated it on Fallon all those years ago?
That ghost of all hallows past does a great Christopher Walken impression… could’ve used more cowbell, though🎃
Is it just me or did some of the laughing sound fake and added in?
Christopher Walken doing a spot-on Christopher Walken impression.
Where is James Austin Johnson
Praying that they move the audience mic away from this lovely, jolly woman before the next skit ❤🙏🏻
Speaking to clear and coherent to be accurate.
Chris Walken. We should either have him host every SNL, or have him appear on every television show being made. Better yet, just have a miked drone follow him around 24/7, beaming his every moment on a live stream feed. Even watching him go to the post office would cause tears of joy.
Every time I’m reminded that Christopher Walken is still alive, suddenly the world feels a little bit better.
Sketch sucked
Walken's the greatest.
Mike Day sounds like he doing a little bit of Owen Wilson
5 minutes too long
I half expected David S. Pumpkin to walk through instead of Walken.
Too bad the Foo FIGHTERS weren’t there too.
Love Papa Pumpkin!
..... Dear jb, don't even waste time on trying to help the evil purposeful -our so claimed minor ally in the desert! Please keep the mouth shut and mind more about the election. ".... words of a  cheat! dt just wants to taste the Potus life once again ...." .... Hamas is a terrible terrorist minded group of minority that started this bloody fight; however, 99.99 % Jewish population are good, creative and peace loving people.  Only the 0.001 percent in religiously bias, acting as extremist and without any regard to humanity, the present leadership of Israel has now become responsible for all these added crimes of killings with the aim of exterminating the other minority group (which will never be possible), all the foolish bloodshed and creations of further century-long enemies and hostilities towards Jews from the majority/other nations as collective global citizens .....
Not of the caliber of previous SNL’s.   Didn’t find this skit funny.
Lamest cold open I have ever seen.
The Biden part was great, but whatever they wrote for Walken was not. He did what he could with it tho
why is JAJ not biden....
Please bring back James Austin Johnson as Biden!
Extremely lame, SNL is but a mere shadow of a what it once was.
Jim Carrey did like 2 skits of biden then quit
I have tried to watch SNL clips but the joke just don't land...if there are any jokes. It is so corny and way out of touch. It has been stuck in this wholesome, cheesy format for too long.
More cowbell!
Omg don’t fall
why wasnt James Austin Johnson biden
So we're going to make fun of a guy for adopting a black teen and giving them a home? Way to hold a mirror to your insanity.
This wasn’t funny
more cowbell!
SNL sucks!!!!!
Sounds like somebody left a mic on
Who are the women who is laughing right into the mic? Thats annoying.
They forgot to make jokes.
Hello neighbor I was trying to ignore.  Ha, ha.  Who was those two kids leaving are they new to the neighborhood.
Great Biden
Mikey Day's Biden reminds me of Tim Conway's old man bit.
This sketch has everything....an old man hanging halloween decorations....Papa Pumpkin.....an adult black son.
They never make the Biden impression stupid enough
So many fake, AI generated comments. Of all the material available to make fun of Brandon with, this is the best you can do ? SNL is truly in the toilet
I've watched SNL since the days of Chevy chase and John Belushi( I'm 70;yrs old) that was a great impression of Biden ( whom I support) but I couldn't laugh, because I feel he is to frail to be president again ( I found it rather sad) there comes a time when we should no when to say, good night😢
Good one.
Not gonna lie, I would like to see more Papa Pumpkin skits in the future. Maybe a collab with David S Pumpkins
They mic'd up this one woman and her laughter was a little too enjoyable
This was pretty bad.
The return of mr Cowbell in person!😊
Christopher Walken cracking himself up gives me life!
I don't understand why everyone is applauding this bigoted attack on his age. Do they not realize that Trump is only fout years younger and after 70 that means pretty much nothing. Besides the fact which Trump shows far more signs of irrational unpredictable and downright alarming behavior. Let's focus on an issue subject that really matters.
U 🥫 👃 my 🩳 in ✋
The writers didn't do Christopher Walken any favors
Nobody says "Happy Halloween" anymore, but President Biden is going to bring it back.
The only thing funny about this skit,is watching Christopher Walken trying not to laugh
Wonder how many times the phrase 'Adult Black Son' was googled that night 🤣
Was that Chloe Fineman laughing at 5:20?
Clark Kent Mike Johnson
Too intelligible to be Biden
🥱Hollow Hell😱Chris!
Quite the pair: One of them is a child molester and the other one is a woman strangler. A perfect TV couple.
☠️?! 🐢 🧣 Mitch!?
If only Sleepy Joe was as smart and coherent as he's being protrayed.
where is Tim Conway when you need him
Not enough cowbell dough...
Lamest cold open I've seen. It had no point other than to "get" President Biden, with no regard for facts. It was like SNL was thinking, "Hey, we've made fun of Trump for years, we need to make fun of President Biden, whether it's funny or exaggerated well beyond anything truthful." LATER: After more thinking, there have been so many times over the last several months that I thought, "Man, I wish SNL was currently on to react to current events." Not once did I think, "I wish SNL was on making fun of President Biden's age, using stereotypical old schticks dating back to Tim Conway's little old man routine".
Dude has given them almost 4 years of material and NOW they’re poking fun at him? Way late
A Funnier Skit would be Biden forcing his daughter to take naked showers with him when she was 12 years old.......oh wait that actually happened💀
Doesn't feel like Halloween without David S. Pumpkins showing up.
I used to like this show more when they use to memorize their lines. Now all they do is lazily read from q cards which takes away from how funny everything is.
Crime and unemployment are UP ☝️ not down. Someone would literally have to live under a rock not to see that
I thought for sure we’d see Stephen Colbert playing Mike Johnson on this weeks cold open.
If only Joey was half as coherent as this
😂😂😂
Christopher Walken is a national treasure.
Wow, seven minutes and I didn't laugh once.
I didn't even recognize Mikey Day (a first). Why haven't they always had him do Biden?
Mikey day has biden sounding like Dana Carvey doing Mickey Rooney mixed with Jimmy Stewert
👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
A president who is complicit in genocide of Palestinians, and all SNL can come up with is lame jokes about him being old.
cheap laughs making fun of Biden's age. Walken's character was a relief.
I googled and he does have an adopted adult black son who’s nowhere to be seen!!
Way too coherent and snappy for a good impersonation
When you're dealing with ghosts-s-s-s and things that are spOOky, you need Christopher Walken.
Ha ha so funny 😂, Awesome 👏🤩
Fabilous and the great Chris Walken - priceless
The best part of the whole show, Christopher Walken
jim carrey better as biden
Whatever. I love Joe ❤
6:45 👻🍭🍬🍫
Man they don't have the guy who played Trump or Biden any more.
The toilet!!!!! And I just showered my laptop with Cornflakes!
Can we put Biden on a tall ladder with concrete underneath please.... lol
Christopher Walken looks amazing!♥️♥️
Few things are more disappointing as an American than watching that corpse publicly pretending to run a country
Did SNL get more writers? This season is freaking awesome so far 👏.  Christopher Walken is my favorite and him reading the poem that my brothers and I said as children is soooo heartwarming ❤.  It's also freaking hilarious 🤣🤣🤣, great show y'all ❤
Somewhere in the middle of Christopher Walker’s bit, some girl started her audience obligatory laugh sequence it seems directly into the mic and I gotta say… it was weird
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤
He's not a good enough impressionist of Biden. Sounds like George Bush
THIS BIDEN I LIKE HE IS SO REAL  MUST SEE MORE OF HIM THIS BRING JOY TO OUR TROUBLE WORLD THANK OU SNL
Wow, this is terrible.
HALLO! 😂
Walken barely saved one of the most unfunny sketches in the history of the universe.
Mike Johnson's actor is so creepy, he looks like a mannequin
Treat yourselves. See Walken reads The Three Pigs. Nuff said.
This show is no longer funny.  I wonder if the actor playing Joe Biden also showers with his daughter.
SAW X was the worst
So, apparently Mike Johnson has compared the experience with his “adopted son” to that of the Tuohys and Michael Oher. Given what we’ve learned about how the Tuohys also never formally adopted Oher, but rather tricked Michael into a conservatorship that soaked him for millions of dollars and led to a civil trial, all I can say is, Republicans really seem to know how to pick the worst of the worst to be their leaders.
Should've had Biden fall off the ladder then cut to Kamala stating she was now president then back to Biden actually OK and asking "scared ya' didn't I?"   Should've had Biden read "Trick or treat, let me smell your feet...If you won't, I don't care, I'll just smell your hair." Followed by..."scared ya' again, didn't I?"  None of that occurred to the "comedian elite" at SNL?  Or they're just too liberal to do actual humor about the Dems.  Their mission isn't to create laughter, but to protect the Dems.  YEARS of Biden denying granddaughter.  But just days and they imply Johnson had the Black son out of wedlock, like Hunter did.  No mention that he was actually adopted.
Sad.....Just so very sad...
many NYers in Audience walked out as they made fun of their Hero Joe Biden.
His hand looked fake.
What’s with the fake canned laughter??? Its distracting
2:40 so many comments on christopher walken I expected him. 4:42 okay!
Should've had Lauren Boebert explaining the Hall of Ween
Walken looked like he was having fun.    ;-)
Now do a skit where biden doesn't push for ceasefire in Gaza, we get into a war with iran, and WWIII happens
Walken has a hard time keeping from cracking up LOL
Someone listened to Countdown with Keith Olbermann for that John Mikeson joke. And still can’t get over Chris Walken who can’t get over himself
Papa pumpkin 2024
Papa Pumpkins delivers Poetry! ❤🎃👻
Relieved to see SNL Joe Biden not pull an SNL Gerald Ford with that ladder…
Mikey really captures Biden's face.
Every year we come together for this 🎃 Happy Halloween
Yup writing is still lame....ughhhh.
Snl making fun of biden and not trump? Cant be
A lot of my closest friends are ghosts LOL
CW - "cannot spell hallloween without hello" -lol
No 'Genocide Joe' reference with that severed limb? K.  #FreePalestine
Jim Carrey is the only biden for me
Walken was trying so hard not to smile during that applause and it made me so happy for him to receive that reception
"Who I PHYSICALLY FIGHT every single day!"🤣🤣🤣
Nothing puts people at ease like an 80-year-old-man hanging Halloween decorations LOL
Christopher Walken needs no introduction.
That was crazy when Christopher Walkedin
He's doing Dana Carvey's Micky Rooney.
Oh we gotta get Papa Pumpkin and Davis S. Pumpkins together!
shame what time does to a man, he is starting to look like christopher walking dead
Schmell my feet 😂😂😂😂
"Who wants to see the Ladders President go higher?"
Wow SNL is as old and Stale as Biden.
That skit was unwatchable until Christopher Walken showed up. Even then it kinda sucked.
my man, Chris! Luh you papi.
The Padishah Emperor of the known universe wishes everyone a Happy Halloween. Because Arakis needs more cow bell.
Gawd - even Chris couldn't save this horrid opening. And THAT was supposed to be President Biden? Please bring back Jim Carrey!
Christopher Walken is a national treasure
SNL dont forget Inflation is up, wars are up, so 2 out of 5 really sucks!!
Omg loveeee Christopher Walken!   God bless him & Mikey day!!!! Legendary
Reminds of Mrs. Whiggins on Carol Burnett Show
Terrible Biden impression.
Love Christopher ❤
This is the best your diversity hires can come up with?? They need to go back on strike... forevah!
Was there any joke in this?
Christopher Walken is hot. I don't care who says differently.
even in the impressions went to shit now,, SNL suckssss
Watching Christopher Walken break character is 🤌
HALLO HAHAAHH
Dumb!
I... Did not expect Walken. That was awesome.
Crime and unemployment is not down at all
Happy Helloween!
That was bad overall. And the jokes about Biden’s age are tedious and obvious.
Well done Mikey Day on his impression. Loving Christopher Walker’s appearance.
I dont think biden needs an snl skit. He is an snl skit.
Wow  they went way harder on him than they ever did Trump! lol snl blows these days. However they did a horrible job with his voice. He speaks way slower than that!
Christopher Walken what a legend 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
I can't see Christopher Walken without thinking of the Weapon of Choice music video, a legend I'm always happy to see.
I once saw an actor (who has since been disgraced because he was a monster) do an impression of Walken doing this exact poem.
Christopher Walken!!!❤❤❤
When he started singing what a man that was comedy 🤣
"stock market is down" is also a positive. fuck wall street.
Muuh..Walken saves the weak skit..
What a man what a man what a man
Why Mikey Day as Biden? Where’s James Austin Johnson?
Nice cape, Pappa Pumpkin! Thanks for showing up.
Walken doesn’t even have to try
Im pretty sure Mike Johnson is human trash but the non-adoption is totally normal when people take in teens. I see a lot of chatter about why they didnt actually adopt young Mike, but it is a very long process (usually several years with older kids) & it's very possible that parental rights werent terminated in time. It's also very expensive & i worked with numerous families who my agency recommended to stick with fostering officially & become a forever family without the court, it's extremely stressful to push thru an adoption in 3 yrs, which is counterproductive for kids in foster care. Some folks adopt kids as young adults when the 18 yr old can sever the parental relationship, others set up a trust or just write the child into their will. I have a feeling young Mike doesnt want to be publicly identified with those politics.
It first got funny at 4:33 when Walken appeared.
Mr. Walkens is such a legend!  Still looks great!
And Christopher Walken really is 80 this year!
I slept in the middle of the skit.. bad thing 😢
Is Sleepy Joe throwing the out the National's first pitch? or, will he trip?
Well done!!
They should have dressed him as a grim reaper for the Palestinian children murder he has supported, allowed and funded….. And his dumb plan to force the remaining one to an Egyptian desert! Why should Palestinians go to a tent city to an Egyptian dessert - why can’t Israel give them a safe passage to their own land and get out of the illegally occupied land and get back into its own border  The world sees past Israel and Americas ethnic cleansing of the land / give Palestinians their land and stop forcing them to another country / give them back their own land is the only moral thing to do
James Austin Johnson should not have been replaced in his Biden role, especially if the impression is just gonna be a one note “Biden is old” joke.
What was the point of any of that?
Stop coming for money bagg Joe 😂😂😂😂 he has my vote
"Mike Johnson, no one's going to forget that."  When you're gone, no one's going to remember it either
Sounds like Jim Carrey doing an impression of Jim Carrey.
That is a terrible Biden - It took actual Christopher Walken to save it.
Grow a backbone! Gaza is being bombed.
Mikey Day's Biden is pretty funny
SNL should have Alec Baldwin on. Remember him? He could do Joe Biden in a skit about ghost guns. 😂 It'd be killer. 🤣
I'd like to see trump get even one step up on that ladder. Biden can still cycle!
😅😂🤣😭
Free Palestine!!!!
I guess if I was seven part of this might have been funny?
That's a terrible Biden
Ladies and Gentlemen, FOO FIGHTAS!
No slurring of words. No losing train of thought. Yeah not exactly accurate of ol Joe right now
Did they give a microphone to a teenage girl, it’s very noticeable in the audience mix.
This Joe Biden impression sounds to much like a Bush impression.
No David S. Pumpkins this year?
Their writers still on strike?  This sucked.
This has me deadd. 😂😂
Truly unwatchable.  Who comes up with these sketch ideas, and then who approves them?
Piss-poor impersonation.
4:33 Thank you
Christopher Walken just out Christopher Walkened Christopher Walken! 😂 I was expecting David S. Pumpkins 🎃
Meh. SNL just isn't the same since McKinnon left. 😞 EDIT: After posting this I read some of the other comments and decided to watch the entire clip. I mean Christopher Walken! But no, even HE was unable to make it work, for me anyway.
Pretty sure that’s the wrong side of the ladder to climb
Horrible writing, horrible delivery. Walken pulled it off just cuz he's him.
And the only joke they made about Biden is that he’s old.  Talk about the low hanging fruit.   Again, we aren’t dealing with funny people.
Wow this show has really lost its ability to be funny. Seems more like a therapy session for left winger comedians. Happy they didn’t begin it with a trump sketch tho.
I don't mind them mocking Trump  But mocking Biden is great, you gotta find comedy on both sides.
Laugh track needed for this non funny skit? Oh well.
Walken’s poem is a callback to when Kevin Spacey did “wheel of impressions” on Fallon. Cool Easter egg
Well, that was lame.
Walken seems like he just strolled in off the street, delivered his lines, but his quirkiness is as hilarious as ever.
Feel bad for Christopher Walken appearing on this crap. SNL should have been cancelled years ago
Those who voted Boden should be drafted 1st if We go tonwar..   women, men and gender "fluid" ..
Yeeeeesssss! 🎃
Meh. SNL just isn't the same since McKinnon left. 😞
Mikey Day as Biden!
It is I guess a little bit funny but so true to life then it is sad that a guy of this age deep in the throes of dementia could still be running a country
That was the best cold open I’ve seen in years!
And just like that, a new holiday tradition is born: Christopher Walken as Papa Pumkin!
Adult black son,wink wink😂😂😂😂😂
Groceries are high price
That guy does a good Chris Walken impression
I remember a time when SNL was actually funny.
Worst biden personality ever
WOW! That REALLY... took me, by! SURPRISE!
Christopher is always great 😅💙
This sketch was as painful as watching Joe Biden deliver a speech...
I’ve been having a rough few weeks and surprise Christopher Walken was exactly what I needed. Made my heart leap. ❤️❤️
Humor is great because it is reality but in this case it is tragic and sickening
Papa pumpkin 🎃
It was painful to watch. The worst cold open in years.  Do we need more age jokes?   My guess is that the real comedy writers had little to do with this and Christopher Walken wrote most of it.
boy who needs some new writers
Crime is up...and I leave it like that. Back to our sponsor, Johnson & Johnson.
No one expects Christoper Walken! 😆😆🎃
I’ve never seen a moment where Biden was that perfect with pronouncing of words. Now his random changes of topic are dead on
Who gave SNL the go ahead to bash on Biden ? It took them over 2 years to come up with something funny about our national clown? Wow.
😂😂😂Loved it, but then I always do!
This is not great...
I need more cowbell
Ageism. Shame on SNL. Impersonation was good though.
Um, yes. This gave like three angels their wings. Great comedy. xD Smart af. Loves it ♥
Cold!  Reality.
We needed  V.P Kamala in the backgroud, crossing her fingers 🤞🤞
My 8 year old could do a better impression
Shoulda been David Pumpkins
Not. Funny. Feels. Something,something,something...
Lol
Christopher Walken, one of the funniest hosts/guest spots I’ve seen (cow bell!!!) He fully commits!!
SNL hasn't been funny since the 90's. Not fit to be called comedy.
He will be back as the ghost of snl greatest sketches for the Christmas special   More Cowbell and Colonel Angus
Who mic'd the audience, we can hear every breath this one girl takes....
More Cowbell!
3/10 mike day's words were too understandable for his impression to be accurate
Amazing props to Michael Longfellow. He nailed Mike Johnson’s voice and on short notice too
This skit was written by Chat GPT
Christopher Walken trying not to break the whole time was by far the highlight of this skit.
You can't spell Halloween, without Hello! 😂💀
Mike Johnson is just Jonah in real life
😅
That was funny. SNL classic gold.
Funny..liberals bagging on one of their own....clowns
Sorry if I‘m late to the party,  but have they got rid of JAJ? And if so, why?
"John Mikeson"... duly noted!
I swear most these comments are bots, this was not funny at all and it easily could have been.
If you listen real close you might hear real laughter over the canned laughter. SNL needs a reboot, with funny people., sad very sad ):?
On a serious note highlight trump & insurrectionists.  President Biden is doing an amazing job  which is a state of mind not an age unlike trump who was born bad . 😂
I'm waiting for the funny part?, ) :   . If Joe was a real president (not just a puppet) somethings he does might be funny, but because he has destroyed our country nothing he does is funny.
SNL should get Kyle Dunnigan to play Biden.
Finally some genuinely funny stuff!
“Relax, I’m not gonna fall” Oh hell he gonna fall🫣
Funniest sketch in a year.
SNL do better
the arm almost flopped .... as people thought it was a really poor choice, but secret service was fine!
Apparently, the writers are still on strike.
You can tell; Christopher Walken is SO enjoying this....😂 - absolutely brilliant....
I missed the Continental Man😅
Is that Pete Davidson in black face?
Christopher Walken was lousey, it did not make sense
Get Grump N Plump 2024
giving Mr. Rodgers vibe lol
That was great.   What a presence.    People are laughing before he even says a word.
Lame, dumb , boring comedy ???
This sucks. 😢
Pretty good
Unemployment and crime are up, not down.  Biden is horrible as president.  This was a great impression!
Great job, Mikey!
Christopher Walken will always automatically get a thumbs up from me 👍🏼 The man's a legend and always will be!  I hope he's handing out cowbells, googly eyes, and champawn-ya (adults only) for Halloween this year!! 😂 😉 Maybe later on he'll go all "Dead Zone" on us too!  Or remember the suave hotel dance number to Fatboy Slim?! Amazing! 🕺
… the toilet 😂
Papa Pumpkin!😂
SNL does plan to eventually write funny materials, right. If this is the best, sorry I'll watch reruns. 😊
Christopher Walken was the best surprise ever!!
Everybody looked short to me. 🤷‍♂️ Also, nothing like having a mic to close to a cast or audience member.
Joe Biden is a one-term President. His re-election campaign ended 3-weeks ago.  We wait and see how long it takes for him to notice.
Christopher Walken is one of my favorite people lol
Christopher Walken cracking himself up is the best!!!😂
Bidet is the walking dead cast member
I’m pretty sure Tim Conway did the same Biden shtick 40 years ago.
Msm mocking Brandon! Never thought I would live to see it
Go trkr treating as corn pop
bad imitation
Ladder were cutting age tech when i was a kid. Lol
❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂
Crime is down? Uhhhh…
THANK        GOD     !          AMERICA         NOW        HAS        AN        HONEST        PRESIDENT     !!!
Christopher Walken Saved an otherwise disastrous open   Guess SNL is going through a few more rebuilding years again.  Budget Cuts
I actually knew a “Mike Johnson” when I was really young, maybe seven or eight.  He was the next door neighbor kid a little older whose family was the first people that I knew of who got cable TV.  They had HBO I think, and the first movie we watched was, “Deliverance.”  But Mike was a total psychopath and so was his dad whose name was Guy.  But Guy got into an argument in a bar supposedly and another guy hit him so hard it broke his jaw.  I wasn’t unhappy hearing about that since Guy was a bigger jerk than Mike.  But my dad had an affair with Guy’s wife — her name was “Anne” — which I suppose I understand since, I’ll admit, Anne was pretty hot.  Anyways that’s my “Mike Johnson” story.  Hopefully this Mike Johnson is better than that Mike Johnson.
Thought he was going to reprise a Chevy Chase skit on that ladder
Crowd is GLAZING.
I think I have that exact same model of ladder.  A bit random but, hey.  At least I’m still “young” enough to use it.  Plus I actually have done some work in my life unlike Biden.
I was really hoping Joe would fall 😅
That’s not a good president Joe Biden he talks too well he’s not falling down he knows where he is Joe Biden does not he should be wearing a diaper they had to have Hunter Biden come in and do a big lien right off the presidents desk right in the middle of this
lol, now that all the damage is done snl can pretend it didn't support biden the whole time he was destroying the country
It’s pretty sad that this past 2 1/2 years all the material Joe Biden has given Saturday Night Live can’t attempt to tarnish their democratic, lover
Good to see Walken, worst cold open since Trump cancelled freedom of speech. Oh wait that's not till next year.
Typically I love SNL, and elected officials are fair game for satire.  Leave the kids and family members who don't seek to be in the spotlight, alone.  Shame on you SNL.
This is the first excellent impression that I’ve seen of Biden.
Why the f*** are they not using the guy who can already do a perfect biden impression?? James Austin Johnson is the best biden on the cast 😢
I need more cow bell and Christopher Walken!
Give credit to Saturday Night live for almost trying to make fun of a Democrat. Joe is a bottomless wealth of Comedy Gold. It is still very weak comedy. It seems they are desperatly trying to get back to being funny for the majority. I'll give SNL an "Almost nice try"
I hadn't watched SNL for years , because , it turned so manipulated by pushed deep  state talking points.  Most of all not funny.....I had hope...But good lord I couldn't even watch this.....
Why is my tivo not recording this?❤😂🎉😢😮😅
It’s literally not even funny.
This is not accurate at all. Joe Biden cannot speak this fast or coherently to make it more accurate. You need to slow down almost two and non-existent sentence and trail off from time to time to different subjects right before finishing each subject
He should get his dog Commander onto Trump
Walkin was the best part, snl is garbage bad Brandon impression.
Is Papa Pumpkin new David S Pumpkin?
Gonna be a hater and say that I do not enjoy majority of scenes with Mikey Day in general. I just don’t see the appeal. The other Biden impersonator they had was much funnier & more accurate I feel. I always feel Mikey tries way too hard in most scenes he’s in. Too over the top.
Bout time they finally did skit like this, too bad they're so late to the game it's as stale as the skit. Managed to drag Christopher Walken into it too lol.😂 Ratings!
AI writers would be better than this
And the Canadian version : "Not too big, Not too small, Just the size of Montreal"
He loves Halloween, in fact, most of his voters are dead.
I think this was the worst cold open to date
Pretty weak tea - get some new writers.
He said toilet!! He said underwear! Whoever this woman laughing is the absolute worst. “Ahhhh hahaha!” You suck, lady!
People rip on Biden for his age, but people don't all age the same. My 95 yo grandma is sharper than many in congress.
not 1 kid sniffer joke? dumb...
"Crime is down"...they even lie about it on SNL.
The forced laughter from the audience is painful. Trained seals prompted to laugh after every syllable.
That's a pretty good impression of Jim Carrey doing an impression of Joe Biden.
Why could I hear one female audience member like she was individually mic'd up
What an awful imitation of a prez best known for squinting  at a teleprompter and struggling painfully to get the speechmaker’s   words  out.
H. A. LL... Um...O...  OMG he's right.
The background laugh tracks are way too exaggerated during Christopher walkins part
Gotta love a country that can full embrace how utterly stupidly disgusting it's structure is composed and how the system repeats itself over and over again a d the majority accept it fully. And complaining and pointing fingers is their only resistance. All while the rich and wealthy continually take 5 steps ahead do to their control and manipulate of the system and structure. While the entire majority that completely keeps the entire country functioning. Yet they only gain baby steps every 5 to 6 years or so. Then they embrace new faces and new old lies and misdirection to lead them practically backwards all over again. Lmao
I thought  Steve Carell would turn up as new speaker Brick Tamland.
Mike Johnson!!! He's perfect for the job...NOT a joke!
Wait Mikey Day could do a Biden impression all this time?!
Hon joe
Fcuk apartheid
This bit has the Tim Conway "Old man" routine written all over it.
How do you improve any SNL sketch? "It's Christopher Walken for some reason!"
"Did you come in through the chimney?" "Close. The toilet."  Now, that deserved an even bigger laugh than it got.
It was a nice surprise to see Christopher walk in
He's channeling a whole lot of Dana Carvey...
Terrible biden impression. Thousands do it better on tiktok and we are stuck with this?
I feel like the stock market being down sounds like a good thing to me. So you mean to tell me the rich aren't capitalizing off of being already rich? Sounds great for the majority of us.
Halloween is all a Bout cowbell and you cant spell Halloween  without an el
Mikey Day is a talented man.  I couldn't tell it was him.
so worth it to hang in there til the end , was just about to shut it off
finally ....more cowbell baby.....good job..keep it up
Good one SNL!
SNL has been crushing these cameos lately I must say.
What happened to SNL 😒
Why is this talentless guy doing Biden? Where is that excellent comedian who was hired last year, and was a genius at doing impersonations (Trump, Biden, MitchMcConnell, etc .. ) Is he out? 🙄 This one is worse than mediocre
SNL has laugh tracks now?
2:19 😂😂😂
Walken is a national treasure that must be protected at all cost.
Palestine lives matters
Who voted for this war monger Biden ???
This is classic SNL, I laughed out loud like I did from my high times...
When I was a child ladders were cutting edge. They were our I-Phones. 😂
Is the girl laughing in the audience an off-screen character??? The way she was mic’d 💀
Omg lol on joe biden too funny
He looks more like jimmy Stewart
This was great but I could have used SOME creepy Biden whispering!
The Spirit of Halloween definitely works for Walken - especially when you consider he’s perpetually shrouded in the mysterious circumstances of Natalie Wood’s death. Not that it was his fault, but he knows more than he’s spoken publicly, and yet we just act like the weirdest thing about him is his voice. I wonder why exactly he hasn’t been forthcoming. Maybe someday we’ll find out. But for now, it seems we’re all just gonna act like everything is normal.  BTW: his friendship with a murder aside, I like the guy as an entertainer, cause who doesn’t? I just think think it’s bizarre how the entertainment industry ignores these kinds of things, especially after all the supposed changes they’ve made. This isn’t by far the worst of them (Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, etc.).  Halloween IS the best part of the year. Have a good one, you darling creeps.
SNL suck these day. Get better writers. Straight up. Crowds telling e when to laugh when something is not funny won't make it funny.
MORE COWBELL!!!!
I miss those continental skits  from back in the day!!
“ the grim reaper , who I physically fight every day “ 😂😂😂
Is it even possible to impersonate Joe Biden without slipping into Tim Conway old man mode?   😁👍👴
After that I want some.....Champanya!
This was written by a 33 year old.
*MAGA MIKE!*
We need more cowbell!
isn't the vice-president second in line to the presidency? so wouldn't Kamala Harris replace President Biden?
💙💙💙 *VOTE BLUE EVERYWHERE*  💙💙💙 💯 *"EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW"  Save our democracy!* *We will have to out vote both the Republicans AND The NO LABLES, 3rd Party, candidate!*
Little known fact: Christopher Walken is protected by UNESCO
Pretty darn president Biden could climb that ladder 🪜 a shit ton easier than trump can get off the toilet seat.  Just sayin 🤷 we can all joke about an 80 year old man running for re-election, but is there really another choice?  President Biden is approximately 💯 more qualified than trump.  Cheeto = (Insert wtf ever the worst fear anyone has ever had) cheeto = trump (just to clarify for all the cheeto loving folks.. when u eat cheetos, u are eating a tiny little twice impeached, 4 times indicted, criminally liable rapist former failed U.S. President's tiny little 🍄 🍆)
Holy crap. Walken is 80
I had no idea Pete Davidson is black now.
ATTENTION!!  Masks cause cancer. Google "Mask study published by NIH".
Wow this was so bad 😂😂😂
Walken  just  Walked in
I need to get a hold of Christopher Walken. When I was a young dj he hired me to dj at his house. I had no idea who he was.
Only Christopher Walken can breathe life back to SNL, smart move !❤
Eh, only funny line was the bit about the arm
Christopher Walken is a treasure.
Not a great President Biden character......disappointed. Love Mikey Day....but.....nah.....
Terrible Biden impression, he doesn't deserve this. Trump deserves all the mocking in the world but I can't stand him or anything related to him.
Girl too close to the mic
The best!!!
Love Mikey Day, but just bring Dana Carvey to do Biden next time!
Some girl in the audience is way too close to the mics!
Had a Joe Biden please donate money advertisement right before the video. My first thought was they nailed it!
when I was kid ladders were cutting edge technology 😂😂😂😂
Christopher Walken is 80 years old and still crushing it!
I'm in love with that one subtle female voice's laughter 6:15
Christopher Walken finally starting to lose it and nearly chortling over a campy script - priceless!
Walker, I got a fever a fever for more cowbell 🐄 🔔 😂😅🤣
SNL was great tonight! The whole episode was funny the host killed the monologue and Foo Fighters rocked the house.
What a treat, #ChristopherWalken! Too good!!!
Mikey Day Killed it
lol walken starring around at everyone to see if they knew how to spell halloween
This was terrible, who lied and told yall this was good.
Christopher Walken was amazing in Sleepy Hallow 🧡🎃
James Austin Johnson wasn’t available tonite?
Christopher Walken is a very unique national treasure.💙 Of course he gets a “Live from New York…” solo.
What happened to Natalie, Mr Walker?
How was that even funny
Halloween ................Its CrAAzy
Why does it sound a hint of Owen Wilson?  Hahaha
Christopher Walken was fantastic as always ..But that sketch was brutally unfunny
Bad writing. :( Do better. So boring. Walken is amazing but this even wasted his breath.
He sounds more like an old SteveMRE1989 than Biden
This was a bit cringy. Didn’t laugh once
This was lame. No wonder SNL sucks.
Always fun to have Christopher walken appear! Hilarious introduction 😂🎃🖤
Kevin Pollak!
Mikey Day’s impression of Jim Carrey impersonating Biden is on point 😉
I like how they captured mike Johnson looking 12 ,and 72 at the time.
I COULD READ A (SHOPPING-LIST) AND, READ IT (FUNNIER) THAN THAT COLD OPEN!!😮
John Mikeson
Check the expiration date on that can of laughter.
Who was the female that was laughing right next to the microphone?!? Sounded like it was part of the skit 🤔🤷‍♀️
Halloween's supposed to be _fun_ -- climbing that ladder was too _terrifying!_
This skit made my face hurt from laughing and I'm only 3 and 1/2 minutes into it!!
Christopher Walken to a bar….
This guy is talking way too fast for Biden and making way to many complete sentences. If this was the real fool, he would be talking a lot slower, mumbling his words, screwing up his words, trying to shake hands with someone that is not even there, falling asleep on t.v., and telling people not to jump.  Idiot!
Great job, Mikey! That couldn't have been easy.
Did anyone else legit forget that Biden was president for a moment? I missed having a relatively quiet president
Hey NBC find some new writers! The cold open used to set the pace of the show but it isn't even funny anymore! If not for the fake audience laugh tracks u play. There would be no laughs!
Where is David s pumpkins???
♥
Walken has a walk on!?! Amazing! My favorite host of all time.
And he's supposed to be the President?
This show needs to be canceled. Foo fighters suck!
Missed how mentally disabled he is by quite a lot still somehow
WORST SNL ever
Absolutely the best show I have seen in years
i was hoping for david s pumpkins but instead got              papa pumpkin. eh ill take it.
So I guess Christopher Walken is the new Vincent Price.
Walken saved the skit from spiraling down.  So much material to choose from with Biden this week and this is the best they could muster. More Walken. More cowbell.
Where’s James Austin Johnson?!?!
Mike Johnson didn't read The Handmaids Tale, but he DID hear a take on it through his pastor and he thought it sounded really good 😂
Christopher Walken is a national treasure who needs to be protected at all costs!! 😂😂😂😂
I feel like the writers are still out.
SNL certainly is not what it used to be. Real dry boring material. Not even funny anymore. Obviously hired laughers in the front row 😢
Mikey Day’s is the best Biden.
Whoever wrote this Cold Open - has recaptured the magic of SNL's golden past. Most Excellent.
And then came Cristopher Walken. He would make a GREAT DARK BRANDON!!!!
Christopher Walken always makes me happy ❤
Man... Christopher Waken is old. That's so sad.
😮😅😅
😅😮😊😅😅❤😅
What happened to the last Biden?
I’m not out of breath, I’m just excited because Halloween is the greatest holiday in the world.
I cannot believe a homophobic, climate change denying, racist, gun obsessed, religious fanatic whack job from my hometown, Mike Johnson, is now second in line for the presidency. What f'ing world are we living in. Now I gotta see this piece of shit parodied on SNL every week and be reminded of it. We are ashamed of him here, so we're so sorry that now you guys gotta look at him too on SNL. He's gonna be the most boring character since Pat ( who I actually did love though ).
I just want to know who the woman is that was laughing so close to the mics...😄
Ageist crap
Mikey Day sucks as Biden. Really.
Mike Johnson actually scares me. He's the kind of conservative who believes that born-again Christians should turn the US into a complete theocracy craziness. And he's second in line to become President...
umm, not the best Biden imitation
Kind of surprised James Austin Johnson didn’t do Biden? I felt like his Biden was so good last year lol 😅
James Austin Johnson was a good President Biden.
Wait... so it is bad to help a poc kid? -Michael was an adult with a family of his own. He asked not to be involved in their new public life.
Christopher Walken killin it !!
Walken for the Win.  Always.💖💋
Completely missed opportunity. At the end Joe Biden could’ve said “Feet? No thanks I’m more of an obvious underage hair sniffing guy.”
Christopher Walken  Dead Zone! Enough Said!
Having an incredibly hard time imaging Walken as Shaddam IV, Emperor of the Known Universe, but I'm sure that it will all make sense eventually.
I need more cowbell!
I made it through the whole skit without laughing SNL has gone downhill continuously
Cmon, Joe, you NEVER leave shit on top of a ladder.   Safety last.
Where else would you be able to watch Chris Walken read cue cards?
Biden is too coherent and enunciating too clearly to be believable
Crime isn't down.
That ADORABLE little laughing girl strapped to the camera is KILLING IT SO HARD AF
God this is awful....
First of all what I do find mildly amusing, is how they are poking fun of Congressman Joe Biden, just out of curiosity how is it that you have gone from making him look like a total tough guy, via when Jim Carrey was playing him. Two making him look like an absolute joke, which he always has been his entire career, but that's just my opinion:-) presidency
I never thought I would ever see Christopher Walken and Jack McGee from the dysfunctional home show on in living color in the same room together. This is a historical TV moment.
forever onward, the word is pronounced "schmell". so declareth The Walken
Love Christopher Walken!
I love how the jokes were very flat and mediocre, but the crowd laughed so intensively because it was Christopher Walken 😅
They’re still being too kind to Joe
Christopher Walken is a national treasure and I needed him tonight after hearing about the death of our beloved Matthew Perry! 😭
Gay couples "adobt" their partner all the time, it's a legal loophole that endows rights in jurisdiction where "marriage" would not be legal...
Its just not funny. He just doesn't do a good impression
The limb is actually that of a Gazan child.
A swing & a miss for the writers on this sketch. That was rough! Didn’t laugh one single chuckles.
SNL BLOWS! SO BAD
The writers are the only ones laughing. They pulled the best joke of all. Apparently the studios didn't put in the new contracts the jokes are to be funny.
"President" Joe Biden. HA! He didn't win.
my mans at 3000 ping
Yeah, Biden is old, moving on.
So the joke is Biden is old-very clever and original.
David S. Pumpkins is the true Spirit of if Halloween!  Not this Papa Pumpkin imposter!
Fire Mikey Day
I’m sorry. But Mikey Day’s Biden is terrible. Where is Austin?
Anyone else her a girls laugh that kinda stands out and it’s annoying?
Mike Johnson’s black son? SNL isn’t clever enough to make that up.
This show needs to be canceled already
Joe "Genocide" Biden
I seriously thought that was Christopher Watkins! Wow! He sounds just like him too! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This was great.
Don't care for SNL promoting MAGA crap about Biden.
The world is on fire 🔥 and alot of it is that we have a rotting bag of oatmeal as president. TRUMP 2024
This guy is doing George Bush when he's supposed to be Biden!
That was . . . flat.
He neglected to say "Here's the deal."
So the female laughing once Walken appears IS NOT AN A.I 4/7 OF HER LAUGHS...GG SNL
I guess I grew up when SNL actually was funny. It is a shame that people don't know what comedy is anymore. They should have had Biden and Hunter giving out 8 balls of cocaine and crack for Halloween at the White House . I think SNL needs to hire me as a writer.  Lol .... O ... but they don't poke fun at the leftists.
"Some of my closest friends are ghosts"😂
SNL is a tonic to AMERICA Most especially during these disturbing, horrifying and Unpeaceful times. In the 70's, we would plan the parties with our friends around Saturday Night Live. THANK YOU. XO
That one girl wet the whole floor drooling over... Christopher... Walken??!  OK, woman. Control yourself...
Biden is wealth of material and this is the best they could do? Pathetic.
There’s is no punchlines or jokes…it’s literally just sentences with occasional moments from old songs….yikes…
I didn’t like this sketch that much… I gotta have more cowbell
he does a pretty good Biden
I got a fever ...
That wasn't very good.
Walken is so good!
Lol so glad he will not be our next President.
God SNL has really gone down hill. Nothing was funny in this skit. Ironically Mikey Day makes a better president that our actual president.
I was hoping for more COWBELL!!!
I was hoping to hear Christopher say Foo Fitas.
This isn't Joe Biden, he speaks far too clearly ... dumb the act down a little more... this Biden sounds intelligent lol 😆 😂
This dude nailed Joe Biden . Funniest Biden impression I've seen.
Age jokes are not funny they are lazy
This dude should always play Biden😂😂😂
i would like to know who the girl is that is laughing to close to the mic....she sounds adorable !
YES, CHISTOPHER WALKEN would have entertained  Natalie Wood.... just with his COOL. ❤
No s*** Christopher Walken❤
Wait, Mike Johnson's son is only 11 years younger than he is?
Oh we finally got permission to make fun of the mesiah and leave the unfunny propa gando tds alone. People might tune in again. But oh wait yeah still got somw propa in there. 3:29
I recommend listening to each and every song ever recorded on their monumental albums. Jim was also very inspired by fellow L.A band Sean Bonniwell and The Music Machine, just in case you're interested in the band that helped define the sound of The Doors.
Already this Biden makes more sense then he has in any other situation or broadcast! Go figure it's not him, the real Joe could never Communicate this coherently. Let's Go Brandon❤   My brothers and sisters of the U.S.A. let's say it together!
I’m out of breath watching this lmao
❤ Christopher Watkins!
“On second thought we can do that later” lol
Half expected him to say: "I'm the spirit of Helloween: Christopher Walken.
Deux ex Walken is the best
Christopher Walken IS a National Treasure!!!!!!!
At this point Christopher Walken is not even in the top 5 Christopher Walken impersonators.
Who is the one chick laughing right into a microphone?
The real Joe Biden would have been funnier in this skit than everyone but Walken
no longer funny come on
This was dead until Walken, walked in.
Can you make a retro SNL channel so I don't get recommended the tame BS when I watch Chirs Farley and Norm Macdonald.
Needs more cowbell
The close laughing audio was a bit jarring tbh.
This sketch was incredibly discombobulated. And no James Austin Johnson as Biden??
What happened to James Austin Johnson’s Biden?
Wish they had gone from Biden on the ladder into “Weapon of Choice”.
It's so hilarious that any poke at comedy at Biden from SNL is all safe and uncontroversial, excluding the bike and Air Force One steps fails, and brain egg scrambles during speeches. Let's not forget all of the jobs lost right from the beginning with the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline, record gasoline prices during the Summer of 2022, food prices doubling, $5 dollars for a dozen eggs in November 2022, and now having to earn a minimum of $120,000 per year in order to afford the median home price.
I love Mikey Day, but he's not a convincing President Biden.  James should be cast for this, he can do anything :))
Mikey Day is the best!!
Love Christopher Walken!
Christopher Walken 💯👍👍 and I am so happy that everyone knows how many people have lost their jobs and minds when a two year old was elected President of morons because everything was awesome when Trump was the president because freedom of speech baby 🤠 yeah🎉... But seriously without a business man we have a disaster of a country so thanks Democrats or rats I mean 📖👈😑
The girl in the audience that sounds mic'd has such a good laugh.
Was Walken impersonating Spacey impersonating him (poem from Fallon's show)? Or did Trick or Treat à la Walken originate elsewhere?
Biden impression had way too much lucidity.
Garbage
I think we need more cowbell.
I'm eggplant!
When is SNL going to be funny again without a laugh track!!
Walken saved this lame-ass skit
Christopher Walken is a golden GOD. if I filed my taxes, and the IRS told me that one percent of my income must go to the fact that Walken is part of the United States, I'd be like, "...fair 'nuff." and PAY WHAT I OWE.
Why does his Biden sound like Fire Marshall Bill meets Jimmy Stewart. Walken is perfect…
Christopher Walken and Joe Biden are the same age. Do with that as you will.
:)
I think Mikey is so cute.... this is not the person he should be impersonating after we've had all the hits like Jim Carey
Why does this Joe Biden sound like Owen Wilson lol
Unfunny cold open two weeks straight
It's hard to make fun of Biden because he's a decent man, if not for Walken the scene was dead.
Oh man, that was a really good Christopher Walken impression.
This scene reminds me of the old man on Carol Burnett show. 😂😂😂😂 Damn I’m showing my age😂😂😂
Why is there a female voice from the audience really close to the microphone laughing?
Please make that girl stop laughing directly in the mic
Awesome!!!
Anyone else hearing ONE GIRL'S laugh
Who’s older?
Waiting for the comments from perpetually miserable conservatives talking about how sleepy Joe is an AI plant and SNL hasn't been funny since Belushi.
This guy could be Fire Marshall Bill's brother. #iykyk
Great to see Christopher Walken!!
Republicans have always complained SNL never parodies Dems.  Just whinny weaklings.
I NEED to see Walken's Biden impression!!!
Love chris walken!!!! Wheres david pumpkins!!!
Boring lol
Who's the comedian at 3:00? A hell of a stage presence! ❤
Nothing scarier than unpopular leaders Biden & Netanyahu on the war path towards WW3
Jim Carrey does a better Biden but I'll take this one.
Tired of the Biden is old BS. He could out run and bike half the cast. While trump is sweating, ranting, slobbering, not speaking full sentences, blabbering nonsense, gobbling down cheeseburgers at breakfast and KFC for dinner, and can’t walk straight or up and down a few steps… whatever 😵‍💫🙄
In Chalmette, Louisiana he's called "My Johnson".
Just...no. Couldn't get past the first 30 seconds. Dear SNL - please get it together.
81 million dead Americans in the grave voted for Biden, not counting those that are living right now.
SNL needs a much better Biden, that was incredibly *LAME*
Mikey Day makes a darn good Joe Biden... he has a breath-y, old-man quality that really IS Biden
I love that Mikey isn't doing a Biden impression, he's doing a "Jim Carrey doing a Biden impression" impression
truth is, the  assholes will still vote for the asshole.
Great to see Christopher Walken in the cold open but very disappointed that he wasn't in any other sketches.
Why wasn’t James Austin Johnson doing Biden?
Mr Trump please hurry
Walken with the CLASSIC "Trick or Treat, Smell My Feet" Poem and Mikey Day's Biden were perfection!
We riot if there’s no appearance of David S. Pumpkins this year!
Did they forget the 30 million bribes
time has come Walken plays Dracula😂❤
Worst Biden impression yet, too bad he's usually so good.
There are plenty of missing arms in Ukraine , Syria, and Gaza because of old Joe's foreign policies . How about being a diplomat for Halloween instead of a warmonger. I will bet that the Bidens have plenty of nose candy for Halloween. Trick or treat !!!👻✌️ and if you are offended by the comment 🖕😂
The liberal zeitgeist is dissipating fast Trump is a shoe-in✴️🇺🇸✌🏾
This Biden impression isn't the worst thing I've ever seen. Who's doing that? It's really not good.
I have just one life goal, to let Walken outlive me and become Earth's new leader when the Aliens finally come... out of the ground.
I love that Mike Johnson's adult black son is not even a joke, its just an actual insane piece of trivia XD
I was really hoping Walken would announce himself as "Emperor of The Known Universe".
That severed arm halloween decoration is fitting for Biden to hold,  the severed arm of a Palestinian child from Gaza after Biden supported military aid to Netanyahu to murder Palestinians!
I`m not worthy..... Thank you Mr Walken was quite a treat!!!!!!
😂😂what a trick or treat Chris Walken as Halloween
Is there some in-joke with the trick-or-treat "poem"? It sounded familiar so I looked it up and like three different comedians do that line when doing Christopher Walken impressions. Including this different-in-hindsight impression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvrhVjn0BOo
Christopher Walken as Spirit of Halloween Papa Pumpkin as a follow up to David S.Pumpkins feels on point.  I love this. 🤣
GET OUT!     😉
Nothing is more bone chilling than picturing the leader of the free world balancing precariously on a shaky ladder knowing an ultra MAGA republican and chief architect of the 2020 election insurrection is only 2nd in line to the Presidency!😲😳
Make him #angry lol.....lol...the real #joeB
Pretty lame, guys.
Makes it #funnier #5d
"How did you get in here, the chimney?"  "Close... Twitter ('X')🚽."
Should this also be recorded in the Archives of the Second Nakba?    How Bizarre  #DayOfTheDead #Nakba #Genocide
Why is JAJ not doing Biden though?
Christopher Walken!!!!
Christopher Walken needs to host!!!! React if you think so!!!
I hate to see Walken on his last legs.
This kinda feels like Mikey doing an impression of James Austin Johnson’s impression of Biden
MORE COW BELL
Pay me my gentle fee and let's fix this disaster of a show back to what it is supposed to and was always meant to be, the top Saturday event, or let it slide into the gone.
Even Walken couldn't save this weak, ageist mess - wow...
Christopher Walken is a bad boy who likes to play. If you haven’t seen him in a Fatboy Slim music video from a few years back it’s worth a YouTube search.
Walken nailing it again!!
Even Christopher Walken could not save this horribly unfunny skit. That is the worse Biden impression ever. Bad TV.
Holly shit skit was horrible.
That sucked!!!!
Snl needs to come up with better jokes about Mike Johnson lol, he’s squeaky clean and people are pressed about it
I don't even know how you guys have happy enough lives to sit down and get through a 5mi. Skit!  🤷 Aren't you suffering and paying the years property tax on rent EVERY MONTH? The Pantry's got to be empty at least. We keep our food in a box from the food line😢. ....so if u enjoyed this go outside take a walk and have some deep thought
Matt Gaetz adopted an adult son too. Conservatives are all mental.
Mikey Day committed to keep that right hand hooked.
I wanna see Walken do a Tobin Bell!
Oh dear.  That was one of the weakest "Cold Open"s I've seen in several years.  Performers were good; writing was dreadful.
You can't spell Halloween without "hello"? That reminds me, and I might be the very first person to ever think this - but you can't spell us without US - you know, like the United States? That just came to me out of nowhere. I'm like a stable genius.
I feel like Halloween should be canceled this year, anything that reminds us of evil scares us.
90s snl was so much better. This was not funny.
Christopher Walken - straight LEGEND!!!!
Christopher Walken Is Still The 🔥G.O.A.T.🔥...😂😂AWESOME Opening For SNL👍🏾💯👍🏾
Someone fix the audience mike
The scariest thing is someone got paid to write this sheet
Wait... There's a new speaker of the house?   Dang, I didn't even know this guy existed..😑
Biden isn’t this coherent. All the jokes in the world for Biden and they ignore it. Pedo creep with dementia who don’t even know he’s in the world. Trump isn’t too much better but stop the bias and be true comedy.
Wait, random adult black son...? Is Mike Johnson really Matt Gaetz who is really George Santos??
this skit is better without the voice....
I see SNL must have lost some good writers over the strike. That was one of the weakest cold open's of all time.
No JAJ as Biden? 😢
Christopher Walken's impression of Christopher Walken will never be defeated
For a second, I thought the severed arm joke was going to reference the Gaza Strip.
Hilarious!
Sleepy Joe is back for the most spooky night in Merica!
I hear just one girl laughing this entire sketch…it’s throwing me off
Schmell my feet. 🤣
Make your choice America! Frail old man or traitors who are intent on destroying democracy in America. I will take the old guy.
I miss Jim Carrey, playing Biden
Actually, the stock market is way up! Just saying... Doing great, Joe!
After seeing Christopher Walken it might be time for a The Prophecy marathon.
I gotta say, no offense, but I like Mikey Day's Biden better than James Austin Johnson's. Sorry James Austin Johnson! Your Trump (and many others) are the best! ... But maybe not here... At least now we can have two actors in the debates.  Note to the audio engineer: get that gasping and laughing person (female?) away from the mic. Holy shit her inhales and laughing were distracting.
This was the best episode they've had in a while! Nate was excellent also!
Am I the only one shocked to see Christopher Walken?  I thought for sure he died a few years ago.
A CWTreat...WOW!!!  Fully unexpected!  🙂👍
The only message I want to hear from Ol Gramps Biden is, "I'm resigning. Not a joke"
Terrible impression because I could understand every word he said.
Mikey Day channeling his inner Tim Conway 😂
Eh! It's Walken hear!
😂😅"When I Was A Kid,Ladders Were Cutting In To Technology. This Was Like An I-Pad."😅😂😂😂🤣
🇵🇸
Everyone knows Biden isn’t allowed to talk to anyone 1on1.
The poem is from a Kevin Spacey Wheel of Impressions bit, did not expect that lol
So... Funny!  Love you real Joe.. But.. 😂😂
Now hold up, where's Nate at???????????
i have a fever and the only prescription is more Christopher Walken!
we need more cowbell. even just one wack
I love how utterly random and unhinged this is, lol.
Christopher Walken was the best part of an otherwise pathetic dismal opening act for Saturday Night Live,so far the show has been a shit show except for weekend update, for goodness sakes when the hell is SNL going to be funny again?
What the hell is with the over the top female laughter??? so weird...
That looks like the old man walk that actor and comedian Tim Conway used on The Carol Burnett Show.
love that one girl sitting too close to the mic, honestly thought she was crying a couple times
The lady laughing in the crowd audibly louder than everyone else ruined the sketch
I wonder why they didn’t choose JAJ for this one
Christopher Walken ~ Hoyuukus  Poyulkus ~ He's worth Show ~ Schmell my feet 😂
I got a new word extinctionist.  It means fuck humans can’t wait til there extinct.  Hopefully a good genetic pool will survive this unspecified disaster.  But who cares the Fermi paradox is bullshit.
Love u Mikey😭😭
I remember when this used to be funny
It is so nice to see we can make fun of a Speaker of the House that would never ever associate with a black person, or a gay person, or really anyone that is not as wretched as himself. John Mikeson or whatever his name is (4:13).   🤣
Papa Pumpkin needed to find his estranged son David Pumpkins
Biden rides BICYCLES. Try pretending he can't walk is age-ist at best.
hes talkin likea GW Biden hybrid
Mikey Day is so booooooring 😮
walken is gold!!!
More like Christopher Walk-on.
Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Pedro Pascal and now Christopher Walken! Love these surprise appearances! Wonder who will be next?!!
Incredible job, Mikey!
is it jsut me or is the audience mic like RIGHT on top of one girl?
I wanted to see David S. Pumpkins!!!
Not a very good Biden 👎
The bit was good overall, but his Biden impression is mid at best.  Needs more time in the oven, I'm sure he can deliver if he practices.
Christopher Walken was the only real funny thing in this video.
Biden has to be the most influential politician of the past 50 years…and it’s not good
This was criminally unfunny until  Christopher Walken stepped in. If he isn’t the guest this is probably the only passably funny part of the entire episode.
Some girl is really close to the microphone
Love Christopher Walken
I fight the Grim Reaper everyday too man. That one hit home for me.
I feel like there were audience members micced during this skit. 😅
Best poem ever. Holy nostalgia! Even Edgar Allen Poe would be proud. Thank you Papa Pumpkin 🎃 🧡
mike johnson is totally the kind of name you would make up for a shitty fake name to get in to a bar with a fake id
When Christopher Walken said “spooky“, it reminded me of Amy Poehler in the Walken family reunion sketch.
Walken is such a classic!
Helloween. The day of the year you meet the neighbors wood stove fire 🔥 creekside ARKansas I saw a camouflaged light brown baby snake in the grass but yesterday!
That guy's Walken impression is decent, but not the best I have seen.
Walken asking to smell Bidens feet was not on my 2023 bingo card.
The adult black son🤣...super weird
were there jokes in there somewhere?
That impersonation of Biden was too Coherent, He would never be able to speak that long without saying something incredibly stupid, Mumbling something we wouldn't be able to understand or falling on something lol..  Glad to see Christopher Walken is still working though..
Great Biden impersonation. They should've had Christopher Walken play the Grim Reaper, he's good with deadly roles. Loved the ladder part 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
This guy makes trump Jr and Biden seem smarter than they are IRL.
Sleepy Hallow the MAD HESSIAN .....awesome ROLE  by WALKEN
Is SNL using laugh tracks now?  If not they should.
😂 Christopher Walken is perfect! Great sketch! Fun times.
Gots to be the most legendary cold open on SNL yet and growing up celebrating Halloween with that poem as a little kid good times, tears of joy and glory!!!
Gotta love Joe!
_LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GON DANCE_
did someone shove the mic next to 1 woman in particular?
Walken is such a class act!
I don't know who the very specific laughing lady who got picked up on the mic was after Walken was in, but her laugh just makes my soul smile.
Incredibly unfunny.
Welcome... To LADDERS!
Bring back James Austin Johnson's portrayal of Biden. Mikey Day's take on him just feels forced. He doesn't have the voice down at all either imo.
Dana Carvey does the best impression of Joe Biden!  Bring him back!
Is anyone in charge at SNL?  As everything so far this season, this is 50% too long.
Great to see Walken! Biden impression is promising. Laughter sounded automated.
Hilarious.  Thanks, just the stupid humor I needed this week.
Joe Biden impersonation LMAO was pretty accurate.
Lame
I swear to god Christopher Walken knows he's iconic. 🤣
That guy just came Walken in the room!!!!
Pappa Pumpkin! 🎃 😅😅😅!  Thanks i needed that!   And oh yeah!  More  cowbell!😂😂😂
I was really hoping this next election cycle they were gonna paint Gus Austin Johnson down the middle and make him trump and Biden at the same time
Think a girl was right up on the mic in the audience near the end 😂
... What was that?
The scene was dragging and then Christopher Walken stole the show! It will be a classic.
2/10 Biden portrayal, too lucid
Hmmm…Biden climbing a ladder trying to hang a Halloween decoration looks *_awfully_* familiar!
Just Walken right in like that
I've never seen Biden so articulate
This sketch needs more cowbell! ❤ Christopher Walken!
The arm of a Palestinian child…#genocidaljoe, #jimcrowjoe
Now THAT’S HOW YA DO IT!!!! W.T.G. SNL!!!
Please let Christopher Walken introduce The Foo Fighters
Far too energetic too be numb skull.
Rip Snl fjb 😂
Ahahahaha they brought back Christopher Walken!!!!  I love it
It’s getting to where a cameo can’t save a bad sketch,
I love how close that one girls laughter is. Glad she's enjoying her Saturday!
We need to see Biden decorating his Christmas tree this winter! This was great
papa pumpkin  😂
😂😂😂
Christopher Walken!!! You made my week worthwhile ❤
I'm so glad Mikey Day is getting the recognition he deserves!
About time you made fun of Biden. Was tired of the constant Trump attacks
Great surprise!!
If I were to picture someone to be the embodiment of Halloween, I would have pictured Alice Cooper.   Christopher Walken might not have been my second choice, either, but he would have been in the top ten.
John Mikeson
The only one problem is that I can understand everything you say and you make sense when the real Joe Biden does not make sense and you can't understand half of what he says.
I wonder why it's not James Austin Johnson anymore, maybe he's too busy with trump!  Mikey did an AMAZING job!!!!!!!
The Padishah Emperor!
This isn’t funny. It could’ve been, with a better actor and script and show.
“My closest friends are ghosts” 😂
I was totally not expecting Christopher Walken...    to read a poem 📜
Christopher Walken is a legend
Normally I’m all for fair game in comedy. But please stop making jokes ridiculing the man in office who stands up for democracy while you continue to make the fascist into a funny cartoon character. You’re normalizing him and condoning his behavior as you do so.
I don’t care about anything else. Longfellow is attractive
Beck Bennett should have come back to play Mike
I love Mikey, but James Austin Johnson has a way better Biden. Why didn’t they use him?
Hi
Walken stooping to this level?!?  Holy smokes!
Mikey perfect Biden! Ronnie Walken back! I want a full Walken hosted show (Trivial Psychic, The Continental, EVERYTHING!!)
I'm 63 and I'm just like that on a ladder. He's in great shape.
Christopher Walken is feeling the spirit of Halloween and I'm here for it! 🎃🎃🖤🖤
There's a female laughing and it's very noticeable after Walken walks in about 4:58.  I feel that she just pulled her seat up onto the stage and sat five feet from the actors.  Not bashing her, as she's having a good time.  But very noticeable.
Great Joe Biden impression
Mike (Longfellow) Johnson!
Much better Biden portrayal
Jim Carrey does a better Biden impersonation
The Legend Christopher Walken causally showing up
You do _not_ want to encourage Joe to smell your feet.
This is the best Biden impression ever, My ribs were hurting laughing at this
It’s a Halloween miracle, they made a Joe Biden skit.
Omg. Soooo on point!
No Joe!!!!!!!!!
😅😂😅😂
Thank you SNL for making me laugh in the middle of these insane times ❤
I’m the 1st one LETS QUIT JOE
