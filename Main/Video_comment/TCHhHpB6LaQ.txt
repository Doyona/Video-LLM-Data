7:53 level 8?
It was a 2 in 6 chance of getting archer queen 1 in 3 for each side
Your captions are saying hard to clean instead of archer queen
4:53 as far as I know, in case if there is one in three chance to get a certain champion in this spinning state in one card, then there is two cards, thus chance to get the same champion showing up on two cards in one in nine, and it happened four shown times in a row, so that brings chance on it happening to one in six thousand five hundred sixty one, which is pretty cool.
Can you Max my account😢😢😅😅
Bro lost so much with I just realised that

Isn’t it 2-3?
U betrayed me with ur archer queen Lets how much u like it getting nerfed and skeleton king getting buffed lol

Proves that the most op card is the credit card
Different type of pay to win..
Crazy, I spent $10 to get enough archer queens T.T
HOW MUCH 💲 for u to get some bitches
This is soo confusing
How many*
4:55  aRcHeR qUeEnNnN tHaTs fUnNy mY gUy
I think OJ was depressed after watching the Skeleton King drops :D
Bro get a life p2w
I got a clash royal ad while watching this lol
When OJ says “is over” you know stuff is going to go down
I maxed archer queen with just $10
He said Level 8 archer queen lets go
whaaaaaaaaat?? pay to win?? nooooooo
OJ every 2 minutes:  UsE cOdE oJ  Bruh dude, no need to advertise it so often.
Btw you didn’t waste any elixir when you activated the ability it gave it back to you because you went from 2 to 3 instantly
Mention that it's a freakin coc thingie
This is way worse than wasting money on cs go
How are you so lucky you get 3 champions
OJ: buy, buy, buy Me: level 8s vs level 10s
Me having negative gem🥲
So basically pay to win but not EA (*_*)
Hi
Since when was the champions update a month ago

Lmao when he said bustin

Royals hogs❌ piglins✅

Hi
Dude no way night witch over mega knight, mega knight is great, night witch sucks now
Forget the queen and golden boy. I love the skeleton king. I wish I had your luck and money lol
Why do i enjoy this so luch
The most powerful card in CR is credit card
I use code oj
I like how oj upgrades cards in his deck so casually that aren’t level 14
supercell could only give the right to buy things using money to OJ and still make enough money
Use code OJ in the item shop.or else E GIANT will destroy you
Yesterday I got sparky legendary from a silver cheat 😂
Brother know imma make a hole in my poket
hello OJ can please try playing this deck? Arcger queen, log, goblin barell, skeletons, valkyrie lightning bomber and archer. please
I'm litteraly crying seeing him totaly maxed out at only challenger 3,Bruh I litteraly hate battling all the maxed players at lower trophies in legendary arena..
bro the deathnote music
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
1
Also I think skeleton king should be buffed it’s like the executioner once it’s buffed it would be the perfect replacement for skarmy
Why is it every one thinking that it’s an insane amount of money to spend,he literally supports himself with every purpose so he gets money back and he probably made triple the amount just from this video
I wish they would update all character animation in this, co.pared to the champions, they're reeeeaaaaaalllly outdated
Listen to the backround trumpet music. It sounds so nostalgic and I know for a fact that I played a game with that music in the backround. If you know what game I'm talking about or the sound name PLEASE let me know.
11:59 Notice that his elixir went from 2 to 3 in a millisecond. Some kind of glitch?

The best card in the game?   *CREDIT CARD*
Why would you ever spend 300 dollars on this shitty pay to play game
Plees can money
There is a 1 in 2 chance to get archer queen if you are choosing which champion to receive, because there can either be 1: golden knight and skeleton king or 2 archer queen and something else.
Why u didn't pinned ferg
This is how nowadays this game is required to be played!!!!  Spending 💰 ! Piece of shit of a game.....
12:51 Oj: Its over its over! *Arrows* - Its was at this moment where he knew he phuked up
to be fair it would take u less to max skeleton king
oj is a legend he spend 70 dolars kanedian for a video
Wait OJ can you get champions before level 14 because i just had a battle and the guy was level 12 and he had a champion
4:00 Gayyyyyyy
To balance archer queen we just need some walls in the game bro
Quote oj on this ‘I am not a Xbow player’ continues to pick archers
Bravo OJ and also I love your videos and I laugh like 300 times! Love you OJ!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😃😃😍😍😘
Defenition of a pay to win
OJ : "who uses three musketeers in this day and age" Me who has a mean 3 musketeer deck : " you fail to see their potential, just like everyone else"

7:05 i loved the Jinxed one <3  Arcane is here
iFerg being the brand new "Just a guy without a moustache" 💀
Honestly I just found these games unfair. It's not neccesarily his skill that was good, but moreover just his levels were higher
I've played this game for so damn long. I've grinded since I was in like 4th grade and I STILL can't get a damn legendary. And no. I cant even get the legendary chest. I'm that broke and unlucky lmfao
Milk gang
Someone go back and count how many times he says Archer Queen
I want to be lvl 14 bad!!!!!
Nice
so they added, champions to this cash grab, wow. amazing.
14:03

Champions are from clash of clans
7:51 botw sound
Play more ladder
Couldve given me some of you gold bit for sure man, just spend it all for yourself 🙄🙄🙄😂
2in6 chance
I use 3 muskateers😑😑😒
Sad waisting about an amount of too much  Me: I had waisted 3000 on just to get 1 archer queen card
Wait what’s this game called?
Glad I'm not the only one who gets Fisherman's.
Pay to win
12:00 if you noticed when you activated the power od the archer queen and when she died you got your 1 elixir back
Pay to win
My clan mate got golden knight from getting to lvl 14 than from a Royal wild chest and used a book of books from last season then a book of books from this season to max his champion for 10 bucks instead of 200
These dollar will save someone's life
Sick!!!
Clash royale still relevant? I used to play like years ago i cant even remember.
Just use a book for the upgrade
they literally made p2w to max champions overpoweredd asfuck so p2w players can destroy f2p and when the f2players will begin to catch up with champion levels supercell will just nerf it "because its too OP"
Ur now the definition of a pay to win
Remember when a legendary only went to level 5
Level 8 Archer queen 👑 7:55 I didn't know it was 8 level Archer Queen
I played against 3guys who had lvl 14 queen a 6000
is he on an alt?
has 3 mil gold "i need gold"
jijijija
OJ at 12:51: “IT’S OVER! IT’S OVER!”, than the arrows to counter was hilarious.😂😂😂
my friend maxed out his champion on the day the update came out…
I upgraded my archer queen to 13 without spending cash but it was satisfying watching him open the chest
3:20 you thought that was funny
B-rad did it for 1600 dollars lol
You want some Dopamine? How about you start gambling?  .....i was talking about gambling outside of mobile games that focus on "whales" and "kids"....
I tought this game was dead 💀
Que asco, ya nadie es buen jugador

Fun fact : coc player can't understand this game

😱
Every youtuber i saw got so much skeleton king
Love how he uses sounds from zelds
Can you use book of books?
Pay to win is so not fair, idk why i watch videos like this it just makes me mad😂
I don't even play clash royale but this is really entertaining!
Archer queen needs to be nerfed

We gotta abuse her while she’s still strong - OJ
Pay to win??? Lol
Rip all on money
It’s actually a 1/6 chance to get archer queen
“Let’s see how many it cost to max a hero” -OJ 2021
Step 1: place archer queen Step 2: conect it to tower Step 3: activate ability Step 4: watch your oponets reality unfold😆
Alright I’ve got a problem. I was in arena 7 and never got dark prince, prince, and mega knight. Now I’m in arena 9 and haven’t got those 3 and ice wizard. And I’ve always wanted mega knight and prince. What do I do? How do I get those cards
The botw sound effect
Me with 1000 coins while oj with 4m coins
Level 14 with 5600 trophies bruh
Not tryna be racist but weren’t you in hang over?? KIDDING OG pls don’t kill me😭
Been a min since I watched Orange juice wow
The archer queen is the worst ... what does this guy mean
Him getting the skeleton king is like me getting the miner
I think it depends on luck
Someone in my clan remortgaged their house to max archer queen
he couldve saved so much time and money just by buying book of books :/
I got the queen on lvl14 took me 120 euros, its ok.
Bro I fucking swear to god bro I got one of these chests and I didn’t get a hero that made me think it was only a chance
And now it is nerfed😂
Did anyone see he used 2m gold
Arena 11 and 12 plzzzzzz
Who else here is getting 2 adds which you can’t skip and 20-30 seconds long for each
What the .... Since when cr had a queen ?
Level 14 archer queen is just op
I'm glad the book of books work on champions
I used code OJ
HEY OJ | HOW MUCH 💲 TO MAX A CHAMPION? ONE PIECE YOUR GET
CREATOR BOOST  CODE : OJ

15:23 that's a bit sus
Can you get champions before level 14
Oj we all know this isj ust an excuse to spend money on clash royale
7:01 didnt know u can lvl up a card to lvl 15 without mirror, pretty cool, that card was a good choice
nulls royal
The next champion should be the Dragon 🐉
You should make a cute baby oj plush
this game is officialy pay-to-win now and there is no way making it through mid-ladder anymore, as a 4 year experienced player i give up 🙌
15 dollars lol
£13.50 for maxed golden knight, 2 of the cheaper chests, 2 X book of books. 2+8+20 = lvl 14
Ñ
Hello oj I love clash Royale very much  unfortunately my mobile is too weak And I cant' afford a new one Hope you send me one so I can play it Thank you..😇
The money - the power.
Hundo stack!
No sure why no one is talking about this (maybe they are and I missed it) but the champions will not cycle while in play meaning that skeleton king in the back is a 4 elixer cost to make ur cycle 3 cards instead of 4 while he’s alive this will make some cycle decks absolutely terrifying
Member when getting a legendary felt special
that intro is aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....
who tf wastes so much money on a mobile game
I feel like the game involves a lot of real money and I’m too broke for that😂😐
who uses triple muskatier a mf in my lobys
"They really want that skeleton boy maxed out" - Oj 2021
That’s the main reason why many people quit Clash Royale ‘cause of this.. Pay to win, zero skills
Good job
Actually a good idea for a video!!!
Can you use book of books on champions?
Hakuna matata ragazzi ben ritrovati dal vostro cicciogamer89
Archer queen sincronise good whit sparky, destroying the electro wizard and E dragon
Just sayin rip money
Why is this game become soooooo pay2win related?!
oj having pewdiepie merch lol
I miss the old CR 😪
Djs
12:52 😂😂
Oj: I won't pick teslas because I'm not an X-Bow player... Then picks archers.
POV: pay to win ggs        It’s a joke lol
OJ after getting archer queen 14: "Clash Royale just isn't fun anymore because of how easy it is to max everything"
there is no way I just sat here for ten minutes watching a man max out champions on a school night
Game is so p2w
Love how ok checks if he’s using code ok after he buys the stuff
How much did u spend?
Now getting a champion level card feels as rare as getting legendaries used to be
Bro the golden knight is a walking king activation
To balance archer queen we just need some walls in the game bro
Bought the legendary chests in shop and used 2 book of books to max the queen.
You upgraded sooo many cards!😁
When he said: I think he’s 2 metas behind. XD
$1000??? WTF bro I can pay for new parts for my car with that money
Elon Musk hooked Orange up for this video.
Level 14 aq is definitely pay to win😂
Ok
I literally laughed at OJ getting the first two Skeleton King cards.
I got secondhand embarrassment watching this
7:58 HE SAID THE THING
one question,can you cycle archer queen for two aq?
$10 for me, used two book of books on my golden prince
The chance for an archer queen from the big blue chest is 2/6 +2/3*1/2 = 4/6=2/3
but im the queen 🥱🥱🤫🤫
I just played the archer queen cycle in the casual challenge and  it’s so strong and fun  Too bad I’m only level 12
OJ you should be ashamed for playing at such low trophy levels.
Costed me 10 bucks haha
Does oj realize that you get back elixir if the ability does not activate
it work on my pc thx bro vеry much
I would love to see someone how much it would cost for a new account to get to level 14
oj played ladder????
SKELETON KING SOUND IS GLITCH CHECK UR CR AGAIN SAME HAPPENED WITH ME XD
Guys lvl 11 lightning kills archer queen
Mad spender ..

A Lot - 21 Savage
My man needs to get some quality sleep 😴
Took me $15 to max my Golden Knight🤣🤣🤣
His bank account: AHHHHH OJ: “continues to spend money”    OJ: bye-bye money
Anyone think they need to add a shield card that shields spells for towers or cards?
"it's too easy". Bruh what did you think would happen if you used a level 14 queen in challenger 3
If you don’t use code oj that’s a sin
8:40 Track name?
Why did you stop doing clash royale card interactions
WHY DID YOUR MINER NOT HEAL THE TOWER
Seeing how many legendarys you are getting after not playing in 4 years is mind boggling, they used to be so rare
b-rad intensifies
3:21 This face looks so funny 😂🤣 And now its one of my stickers 😅😅
why the hell only archer queen this is the most unskillful one
“What’s the best card?”  Credit card
This is a great example of the  power of money
NGL the confidence behind the whaling is pretty cringe and convinced me that top ladder is literally just people like this. I'm off this game after 4 years.
OJ: pffft who uses three Musketeers in this day and age ME
Oj why do you spend that much money.
Man opens a magical chest and says "Not even a legendary"  F2P players are cringing, I feel it.
I used my magic items from the two battle passes and got the archer to lvl 14 after getting lucky with getting her lvl 12 from cheaper chest bought from deal
Me im poor Oj: spends 300 dollors getting ancher queen to max level 😂
Oj: i want ancher queen When oj gets Skelton king and golden knight 😭
Skeleton boiiii
“We gota abuse her while she’s still strong” sheesh OJ😳
Ask to cicciogamer😌
Og u should cheese mirror now as lvl 14 mirror gives lvl 15 cards
Gold crate?
Champion mirror?
0:02 *champions
Archer Queen do be a lil OOOPPP
OJ could I show you a deck I randomly made in elixer draft that’s turned out to be REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!!🙏 I think you’ll love it.
i dont normally watch your videos OJ but im legit dying at your gameplay commentary :D
Imagine spending 70 dollars on literally nothing

Today i got mi first legendary ,miner,
Supercell: today is the day  Supercell employee: what do you mean?  Supercell: Payday.
"Clash Royale isn't p2w"

B-rad: 1600$ wasted
I GOT 3 NIGHTWITCH IN A ROW FROM THE KINGS'S JOURNEY CHEST LOOOL
It makes me really mad when he said "not into tesla not a xbow player" you realize tesla is better than just being used for xbow decks honestly that just pisses me off right there
As a level 13 I CAN RELATE to That sh*t if You took Out the level 14 Archer Queen Out I woud Be That Black Guy to
Oj is the one and only that can make me laugh with the "bruhh" meme. The timing that he edits it is perfect and unpredictable
I love watching these vids.  What is the kickback from SC?  Should I use code OJ or code CWA this month for everything, you got last month for some reason.
I was wondering why you wanted archer queen then I saw the thumbnail and felt dumb.
I got Archer Queen lvl 14 with 9€
Too much
I love your videos
7:25 what
6:34 bruh as if you couldnt use him on its own pretty well , as well as earthquake with balloon für example
4:07 its a 2/3 Chance i think
Archer queen is in clan of clan game and I play clan of clan game
CAN YOU PLS PLAY CLASH OF CLANS PLSSSS THIS IS 3848TH TIME I ASKED YOU
1:38 Only the Level 14 one CAN drop them, and one is guaranteed from that.
How to turn off family friendly in clash royale.

I maxed her out with like 25 dollars with 2 book of books 📚
How much did it cost..? Everything…
Prince is better
Clash  royale has become so much more pay to win. Smh
Say bye to CASH Royale
can you clone/mirror heros or does anyone tried queen walk in CR?
🍊 Here is an offering for orange fellows
Soooooooooooooooooo! OP!
I need to take another shower after watching this...
Good Video 😉
B-Rad maxed out all champions on the first day
6:33 :- OJ-  "I use archers I don't really use tesla, I'm not an xbow player" 3.0 X-bow players with arches as key defending card:- Are we a joke to you?
MOLT wanted the skeleton King and kept getting the archer Queen and OJ wants the archer Queen and keeps getting the skeleton King, lol
Floris: €0
He spent many money for this video
I just wanna let anyone else who sees this know that God loves them and that it’s not too late to give their loves to Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior 🙏 ❤️
I think skeleton king is my favorite  Idk why but skeleton characters in games end up my favorite usually
Please make a deck that is just Archer Queen and 1-2 elixir cycle cards
I like how the Skeleton King being terrible is a meme
Wait when AQ dies she says "I'm the queen" in high pitch battle cry, but wait is she afraid to die, I'm so disappointing with that death cry sound
Clash royale:releases a new card OJ:You know the rules,and so do i
I love his f2p account.
oj spent more money in 1 video than i did in my entire account. Yet my high is only 400 below oj his 7013 mine 6627
When I realized he has 2.2M Star Points 😂😂😂
I think that Oj get so many skeleton king because yesterday was Halloween
Me being level 11, it's probably going to take at least a year of daily grinding to get to level 14 :L
Meanwhile B-rad casually spending 1600$ to max out all champions:
8:40 anyone knows how that song/beat is called?
can you clone or mirro a archer hero?
Im Pretty Sure Champion Will Got Nerf Since Its To Op
Is clash royale back or what?
Just use book of books....?
When archer Queen simps get the Skelton king: *intense screaming*
OJ GOT ON TRENDING!
OJ totally destroyed the ladder! (With ofcourse lvl 14 Archer Queen🗣️🎤)
Brad spent 1600
We need some BS video
This video told me oj don't love the skeleton king (no offense)
6:33 so he can get tesla or archers (both in x-bow) picks archers ˝im not x-bow player"
Oi. Do an all skeleton deck with new skeleton king. Like so OJ sees.
Fun fact:  On the Big shot song for deltarune sometimes we can hear : "oj leave the chunk" but  at 1:57 an 2:00 it's more oblivious!
Molt get so tilted when he get archer queen
I'm a fucking loser in this game because I can't upgrade my cards and my deck is useless now
comment number 1000
Its a good thing channels like this get tax breaks and write offs for things like this, otherwise this video would've done some damage 😀
Ahahahah im still laughing bc milk gang crash u
before in the archer queen won the game solo in a matter of seconds
I really hope ur code is oj bc I supported that in clash Royale so I wanted to know if I supported the wrong guy 😂
Btw u don’t lose the elixir if ur hero die after using the ability, it will just take a second to come back
This is the game you just want to pay.  What an injustice, I am very old in the game and now I suffer from the level of cards👎🏻
Archer queen in coc - best wall breaker Archer queen in clash royale - best win condition  This is unfair😭😭
Do 15 level card whit mirror
15 mins of a man wasting his money
Is it just me or is OJ getting sussier by the day? There were 4 out of context worthy moments in the last 2 weeks, and none in the years before
You only need 2 copies and 2 books
Let's go breath of the wild sound effect 7:52
x: How many money you use for max Archer Queen? OJ: Yep
OJ's Credit Card to him : Stop it Get some help 😂
10$ in Italy
I predicted this 2 years ago
This is the most p2w channel
If you miss the ability , it will return after a second . Oj might see that
7:49 level 8???
Just deleted Clash Royale yesterday, pay to win game is not for me. Cuz I keep losing and my trophy is at the lowest 😂
bro Zelda music when gets last archer queen
Can i get the champion from the offer if i havent got 14 level?
OJ there glitch of clone spell.... working on cloning skeleton barrel, Golem, may be lava hound also...can you try
Bro if i had the money u spend u will buy a new phone with a working not not laggy processor 🤣🤣🤣(for watching OJ'S live streams i would buy a wifi too)🤣🤣🤣🤣
I remember when getting epics and legendarys meant somthing
the skeleton king would be worth it if his attacks hit a larger area or had more hit points or something.  otherwise he is just a poorly placed graveyard with mostly less skeletons. even if they made them spawn faster, increase total count or making him always spawn his guaranteed count in front asap because he is under powered.
Lvl 14 barb survives hit from mini Pekka lvl 13
please keep up the videos
Pai Mădălin nu a băgat decât 25 de lei
We all know its 1600 canadian things because of Brad
B-rad: amateur
I didn’t get one out of the 2.99 or 3.99 whatever it is I didn’t get a champion
Who’s watching  when they didn’t even reach king level 14
OJ tell us that we need MONEY MONEY MONEY to max 1 champion
you should get Elixer golem to max because they were your last and hardest to get lol
How much OJ spent you may ask he spent 390 dollars 💵
OJ:And our championnnn is CR:BRUHHHHHHHH
Oj's wallet rn 000001$
2:48  let me clarify his not golden boy but golden Chad knight
It costed everything!
oj copy Brad video
only dream oj crush is his wallets
Some one told me your code ok and always I entered the code oj don't know who. Is he now i know who is he
Dog I got 3 skeleton king’s and 2 golden knights before I was able to get archer queen and she was the only one I wanted
do a lvl 15 card play with maxed out mirror
Oj : finally we got the archer queen after the torture of skeleton king 😂
someone please tell me what song he used when he was contemplating maxing out archer queen
Oj what is you from ?
Oj what is your country?
Please play clash royale more man we love your videos....
Archer queen with no walls. What sins will she commit?
6:33 - I use archers I don’t really use tesla I don’t really play xbow
One thing clash royale really needs to do is go to level 16 or 17 because maxed out players get bored (me).
Just saying that when I updated I got bumped from level 10 to 14
same level lightning will kill archer queen 😎😎
For your next challenge since shocktober just ended you should use a all shock deck 👀👀 the one I used was Electro dragon, Electro giant, Electro spirit, Electro wizard, zap, Telsa, zappies, and a sparky it actually got me a lot of wins
0:44 Anyone heard the background music 🤔🤔
I like when she dies and says “but I’m the QUEEEEN):
Clash royale has upgraded the game so much that even oj forgot that in legendary kings chest we can choose lol😅😅😅😅
How much to max our cards back??? Too much.
next vid you should mirror archer queen and get a lvl 15 archer queen
Top 20 trending
At the end of the video I basically learned that my dreams aren't crushed because I'm using code OJ! That's life changing!
Is an Archer Queen nerf confirmed?
Fun fact:Oj got Many Skeleton King meanwhile On B-rad vid: He got 5 Archer queen and he hate it lol
skeloton king is the best hero

8:42 this made me laugh so hard because it’s so true
Oj: Maxing archer Queen and being so happy While Shane: I am gonna max all heroes
poodiepie merch
The chance of getting archer queen from the king chest would be 5/6 right?
Does anyone remember when Oj wore glasses?
Oj : who uses 3m in this day and age  Me  a 3m main in high trophies : *PAIN*
The queen and the golden knight are so strong but the skeleton king is so darn weak it's strange
Clash royal has become so pay to win
Try it on the one card glitch
I like how the archer queen says BuT Im tHe QuEEn.
Challenger 3. All level 14. I honestly feel bad for the people you're facing.
dam thats alot
Love the headset 🐱
Dude OJ u on trending niceee
pay to win game yawn.
Oj so excited to get to get the archer queen to level 13 Asher queen, he said yes archer queen level 8
you know you can use the legendary Tokyo right?
11:55 if you use the ability but the champion dies before it was activated, the elixir gets refunded
"level 8 archer queen"
7:57 if Knight is Good Stats for the Cost and Golden Knight is Extra Good Stats for the Cost, is MegaKnight Super Good Stats for the Cost?
I think OJ forgot about the legendary wild cards...spent hundreds dollars on that...lol
You
also brad
imagine if archer queen pierced like the magic archer 😳😳
OJ it's using pewdpie's t-shirt
You Actually Didn't Waste the 1 elixir because at 11:59 from 2 elixir suddenly became 3 elixir
“archer queen is my win condition” pathetic i use miner as my win condition
the game is not p2w! the game:
Archer queen is so strong
I use archer I don’t really use x-bow, THE ONLY DECK ARCHERS USED IN IS X-BOW
But I'm the QUEEN!
OJ: ITS OVER ITS OVER! Enemy: Nope
OJ: I'm gonna pick archers since I'm not really an xbow player... Me: Oh... Wait a minute. A few seconds later OJ: I'm gonna pick Royal hogs since I don't use hogquake. Me: Wait a damn minute.
Right after I watched it I got my first legendary at pekka arena from my lvl up chest
THERE IS A NEW GLITCH if you use clone on a golem and the clone get shot at the clone's golem mites are regular golem mites.
And thats how OJs bank account cried in dissappointment of oj
B-rad paied 1600 cad to max em all

Archer queen is so expensive as but it is so op
What does the Queen says when she dies?
good video enjoyed it very much ive been here now from 2018
7:58 lol extra good stats for the cost
I thing that it’s funny how he ignores the emote
Tell me your good at clash royal without telling me your good at clash royal ….. O.J. Spends 1000$ to level up his cards
3:07 perfect use of cod zombie sound effect
Are microtransactions a tax write off for OJ?😂
TRENDING #17 ‼️🔥
8:43 Very smart 😂
”OJ: plays a new deck,” also OJ maxing it fullt out using 500 k gold and all his wild cards
To balance queen just don't give her attack speed with ability
Its 2/3 chance! :D
Skeleton King is Better
Can you mirror champions?
I'm pretty happy with my 6300+ trophies this season.
Do a tier list
"You can't beat cycle queen". No, it's possible, just can't beat money.
DON’T CANCEL ME I JUST NEED HELP!...Spreading Jesus in my new book…(Jesus Is God Scripture Proves It by Cary Glenn)…..available where books are sold.////
Oj fun fact you get Ur exlixir back if the ability didnt get activated
whats this one songs name, played when OJ says he wants to use the Book of books instead of spending money?
Mădălin max whit 5 dollar😂
loved the video oj🙌
One question if you got the chest that OJ was getting arena 12 would you get champions
Supersell lured the whales to the surface with this update.
Uh
Wait OJ isn’t a xbow player my whole life is a lie I am a xbow player this is an insult you didn’t get Tesla
_Because she is the Queen♕_
#17 trending on gaming
10:24 When you realise you just spent $300 and there's no going back...
Orange Juice is best.
I challenge oj to a battle
Feel like the skeleton kings ability should cost 1 elixir and the archer queen should cost 2
7:52 Ah yes, level 8 archer queen
are you gay?
POSITIVE MONEY TRADE!
Bruh my Archer queen will Max out after 2 years if I play continue after 2 year who know there pekka queen with wired ability

How u get dem chests
He said level 8 Archer Queen
To make her even more op revamp the healers Make it that they can shoot healing projectiles towards friendly troops and they cant attack
oj do a video on the golem and lavahound clone glitch it is so broken
Was it just me or did you hear the Zelda music after he got a champion
what was that last chest 👀
Can you make a tip and tricks for every hero
.....
"how much money does it cost to max out heroes?" Long answer: A lot Short answer: U won't lol
I got 8 legendaries in a row from the level up chest
When the speed montage is playing, the bgm reminds me of Fresh's video
The pewds merch tho
''But im the QUEEEN😫''
What a big bully
I got a legends   today
13:56 literally every Mega Knight player ever
what is the song? can you say, please
i feel bad for his enemies bc his a p2w
"bUt I'm thE qUEEn!1"
Skeleton king is way better than archer Queen
This game is going to die,they keep making the same mistake.They make the main part of the update only available to max level players.It’s like they don’t want new players,their updates are only made to please the top 1% instead of trying to expand to a big amount of new players
Orange juice pls call the magic archer the marcher for my sillyfriend
I am 2 metas behind according to oj. I use gob drill
Yeesh that much
I opened 3 of those royal chests and got zero champions…
Sheesh
man u need to sleep
Reminds me of molts video of "buying every champion" 😂😂
Ok you’re Asian I thought you’d be good at maths 😂
Loved the edits lol
1.5 chance lol
But I am the queeeeeeen!
The most overused joke has come back.   What’s the strongest card in clash?  The credit card
F2P players watching be like.. LV9😥😥
So basically, maxing out EVERYTHING from scratch will cost around $100,000? Sound about right
I know archer queen looks the best, but golden knight is a good source for defense and mostly attack
+Orange Juice Gaming at 11:56 you got it back.
OJ, asking all the right questions.
wild chest was my first in the cycle too
Who else laugh when Archer Queen die because of her quote😂
All now no hotfix
OJ knows more about the game then the devs he know every interaction to exist
OJ when you use the queen ability and it died it give you the elixir back
I miss old yarn🍊
Nah man we need how much money to get to level 14 to UNLOCK champions
Oj stop saying archer queen Is sooverpowered because supercell is gonna nerf her
Title to f2p : how many years it will take you to get champion into level 12   (I'm f2p)
You should use a max level mirror and mirror the max archer queen.  If level 14 archer queen is op level 15 will be cracked
There is actually a 33,3333333333333333...3 percent chance that a champion does not appear in a legendary kings chest
too bad the queen will be nerfed before I ever even get to try her :(
Dude I was just listening to that classic drill remix.
Actually the skeleton one is so useless 👎🙂
Basically your kidney.
Queen getting a sure nerf. Has to reduce her ability. Hit speed during the ability will get a nerf for sure. Skeleton king need a buff though. Maybe less souls for full skeletons capacity!  Playing max champions are simply out of reach for an f2p player :(
the level up chests made me unlock 2 legendaries
Supercell : If placed properly a commun card can outperform a legendary card. It is all about positioning and timing. Archer queen : hold my beer
Me: I need 300k more gold to max out my 2 decks which I use   Oj: hehehehehehehhehe let me max my skletons Me:on goblin fire 🔥
You should ask b-rad this question he probably knows
Alternate title: man spends hundreds of dollars on mobile game
So I randomly browse YouTube to see that in Clash Royale there is a new tier or whatever u call it, maybe I might start grinding again
Im just happy he not promoting the clone bug, doubles has become a legendary battle between twelve elxir golems and six Lava Hounds
I think Archer Queen ability should cost 2 Elixir as well as her DPS should decrease while ability is on
how are u challanger 3
Cool animation of Champion Cards
Really not a fan of this update. It just seems like it's a cash grab.
I'm a level 13 and I swear it's impossible to beat level 14s
B-rad: look what he need just to mimic a fraction of my power
Oj is a simp to AR
He said this is before archer queen got nerfed so I think oh knows that she will get nerfed supercell probably told him that
In Mega Lightning chest to madalin legendari is campions
Alternative Title: OJ showing how rich he is
4:15 i think its 1 in 2 chance
How do we enter the code
try raged archer queen it’s broken
Archer Queen not strong
oj تكلم ألغة ألعربية أيضا لأن ألعرب يشاهدوك 🌹
Fun fact I learned from Shane :if the ability doesn’t go of you get your elixer back
Well oj using a maxed aq against 5700s...
8:41 music?
12:55 "Wait how did I get the queen on the third one?" --> Well I guess you are gonna notice soon, but it seems that there is a bug, that appears randomly where the champion cycle is being ignored. Meaning that you might even draw the champion again right after he/she/it died and not after you played 4 cards (as it actually should be). It's f***** up. Let's hope Supercell is gonna fix that soon.
B-rad after watching this and spending 1.6kdollers
the archer queen sounds like michael jackson when u use the ability LOL
Oj Could you try make a video on how to use all the champions? :c
I think they need to make her base attack speed faster, and remove the attack speed increase and add a little extra damage instead for her ability, and I think she'll be balanced enough
“I’m not really an X Bow player” *happy B Rad noises*
I got 2 smelly kings 🥺😭
This just proves CR is pay to win
Madalin maxed out the Archer Queen without spending that much money
That moment when I realize I’m higher up in trophies than OJ
Hi Yesterday I played against you in grand challenge. U was with a meta lava deck and I was with a PEKKA
HAPPY HALLOWEEN BIGOTS!
Hey OJ, what card deck do you recommend for a arena 14?
How do I get champion
Dammmm, but archer queen is op
did anyone one notice when the queen died she said "but im the queen "
5.7k trophies.. damn midladder must be hard with all maxed cards huh?
8:49 me opening all those level-up chests when the update just installed
8:23 night witch spawn skeletons
OJ=Oh my goddess
Yes you could buy "skills" With money in clash royale.
10000000000000 dollers

WOW! yall supporting me so much 9k likes and 40k views  (Oops forgot to switch back to OJ)
Yo oj can u stream TF2

To balance archer queen we just need some walls in the game bro
The most op card has to be his credit card
This whole time I though OJ was doing the sound effects when the queen dies 😂 " but Im the queen!"
Remember when getting legendaries were rare?
7:42  Brad: My disappointment is immesurable and my day is ruined
Plz push live
Yo there is a glitch were cloned troops can turn into normal troops.
how can you spend this much money on a mobile game???
when he was about to use the book of books, what was the music played lol ?
Archer queen was nerfed?
I wanna see lvl 14 mirror lvl 15
I actually love the fact that clash Royale is getting less and less views. I bet that within 1 month, oj will stop uploading clash Royale and go back to brawl stars due to lack of content.🤩🤩🤩🤩
Did anyone jump to lv14 for some reason? I was lv10 and I'm lv14 is super under level cards 😭😭😭
If I know oj is gonna do something like this for once in a while then I'm too scared to get to the wherever arena oj is gonna go
Dani beter join milk gang So ya
I wished He did this in my id
I use code OJ can I lost against OJ :(
When you realize OJ is technically in mid ladder
Where IS best deck for arena 11?
if you buy one of those chests but you are in a lower arena (i am in 14) do you still get a champion
Listening to this I had to do a double take I was like what the heck you mean level 8 archer queen? I was like uh what?
I uninstalled the game because everybody and everything is Lvl14 while I barely can get my cards upto Lvl12
Terko hindi ati hai na kyunki tu Nepali hai to hindi Mai bak English samaj nahi ati apun ko😎
OJ whats a good for climbing area 12 im hard stuck area 12 :(((
OJ if you dont now when you use the ability and then the heroe die before using the skill you get the elixirs back
if you used the ability and your champion died before it taking effect you will get back elixir
Happy haloowen OJ
69 dislikes nice
Ice golem tanking for the archer queen, wonder where I've seen that before
Never give money to greedcell
Cool vid
3:07 I was not expecting that Call Of Duty reference 😂
I cannot tell you how hard I laughed hearing a random zombie noise😭😭😭😭 I played bo2 zombies every night for years
Archer queen: *He He*
I'm starting to watch oj more often
put archer queen in the pocket for ultimate destruction
7:52 Oj: *FINALLY, LEVEL 8 ARCHER QUEEN!* Me: Finally!          Also me: 𝑾𝒂𝒊𝒕 𝒂 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒖𝒕𝒆...
Did you know that the reason barbarian king was not added is if you used his ability it would spawn a lot of barbarians which is wayyy too op so instead of barbarian king we got skeleton king.
This game has officially become pay to win
all weak, (logable) anti air troops are female  Princess Rascal Girls Archers Firecracker (human)
Clash royale is not pay to win..
I don't think OJ knows that you get your elixer back if it dosnt activate, example 11:56
Oj doesn't know that you get your elixir back if your champion dies before its ability gets activated.
epic
Imagine Supercell putting a champion trade token in Clash Royale, that would be OP!
*wallet cries*
ok
There's what in this game now?
“Goblin drill is a few metas behind”
A lot
Happy Spending-On-Champions-To-Max-Them-Out-Ween!
Mirror archer queen clone deck?
Oj there is currently a golem clone glitch where the cloned golem turns into an actual golem !!!! Cheese the heck out of this before it gets patched
Oj pls max skeletking
Hmmm... I notice your headphone.... Cute!
I would recommend OJ to max out his inferno dragon coz it doesn't die to rocket level 13 Edit : I am a lavaloon player so I feel bad when inferno dragon was left out
I just waited for this video to come out
lol
MUST BE NICE!!!😁🤳🏆☝☝
Oj out here with a full level 14 deck and he’s level 14 and I’m at those trophies at 11 that’s how you know he hasn’t played
So clash royale got heroes also i played 2 years ago this game advanced a lot
Lame
OJ opening legendary king chest like I open my door,, 😂😂
Bandit is the best card in the game
b-rad : 😳
remember when legendaries were actually rare?
Star code OJ doesn't work :( for me ;(
lvl 14 musketeer doesn't die to a lvl 13 prinz charge btw
.
3:30 “finally, finally shes level 2.”  Nah brah, shes level 12 lol.
$$$ to win! Thanks for the reminder! Finally got almost my cards to level 13 and this BS. Not spending a dime more on this game.
Magical chest be like- TA TA RA RA RA TA TA TA TAA!!!!
Who Likes To Support Oj Code In Every Game Of Supercell❤❤❤
I see you're limited PewDiePie merch OJ
4:41 me:🧍‍♂️
Lol
OJ could sustain supercell by himself xD
Thank you for the friendly reminder that this game is pay to win
Clash royale's new update logic: if u face an enemie with +1 level just leave the match
4:41 "who uses three musketeers in this day and age" me who uses 3m for the past 4 years :,(
7:54 lvl 8????
There champions!!!!!
Watch Cicciogamer89 video
Amogus
OJ: spends hundreds of dollars just for cards   makes it back with code OJ  OJ: *Mwuahahaha
Where can I use your code idk where
Lol
Bruhbruhbruh
If you use the hero ability and the hero dies before it activates the ability it refunds the elixir :)
Spent my entire 5k gem saving and the $6 offer, bo archer queen, lvl 2 knight / skeleton king 😭
Y e s
The video was fun
Pog no money
i use code:oj on brawl stars and clash royale 🥰
Anyone else not able to play clash Royale because the game won’t open
The most spend money is clash royal 😂😂🌝🌚
Yo Ive been looking forever but can someone tell me what that song is called @ 8:40?
Yo Ive been looking forever but can someone tell me what that song is called @ 8:40?
I learned recently you can clone the champions, so that is quite broken
Will you do the golem bug with clone
And I thought that oj is skilled
Well B-rad already did that...
"Archer Queen...she's my win condition tonight" that was smooth OJ
Its funny how OJ just casually uses 5 legendary wild cards on his mega knight while I can only even hold 2
Oj: Finally level 8 archer queen 🙂
Archer Queen's invisiblity make it special
Its so satisfying (im a f2p btw😀💔)
8:49 this laugh makes me laugh so hard till i chocked on my food
I love you
*wassup wassup*
yoooo wassup
This update makes clash Royale 100 times better cause the hero chest gives you alot of legendary
290 dollars lol
Who else got a a clash ad
Well, B-Rad said he at least spend 1600$ on this so yeah
Man I felt bad for beeing a lvl 12 at 5400 trophies with my 4 cards at lvl 12 0 at 13, but after watching this I dont feel so bad
Lol
Satisfyingggggg
SANS THE SKELETON IS NOW IN THE GAME!
How to balance heroes: remove from game
hear me out... as a ex clash of clans player i'd try archer queen + battle healer
I'm jealous OJ...
i can't use code oj   cries in ftp
I think brawl stard is much more f2p But BS is becoming boring bcoz of no club update and they nerfed soo many cheeses
For The First Time OJ Isn't Maxed Out
What happens when u mirror a champion
2:57 that's not the real sound it's a glitch most probably😂
50k
This is a absolute scam  from supercell, not everyone can afford hundreds even thousands dollar for a game
this is evil
Only Dragon Celenge!
11:57 he got the elixir back?
2:27 that was so funny LMAO
I used the book of books during the slash Royale
This is how I would balance heros: Archer queen ability now costs 2 elixer, Skeleton king ability only cost 1 elixer now. Keep royal knight the same
Yor my favorite ok oj another. More juce
Only Legendary Celenge!
12:51 🤣🤣🤣
Yust cound how much trymax needed
M E G A K N I G H T
It's better to support small creators..
ال 14
Next video lava hound clone glitch. Check my channel for example....
When you just use archer queen and then destroy opponent's tower OJ:It's a HUGE POSITIVE ELIXIR TRADE
Did the legend comment?
Did the legend comment?
265 comment bet
Very nice
Sheesh
Clash royale is so pay to win
Oj I love your videos I just think it is cool you do this
This game is so p2w
I like 2 champions: > Skeleton King because he has the highest hitpoint among the champions. He deals area damage and summons skeletons like Witch. > Archer Queen because she deals a great damage. Her invisibility is really good.
early.
If you actually paid attention, after he used the Archer Queen ability and it failed, he got the elixir back for a positive elixir trade.
They're probably gonna neft her cloak to like 2s, or make her attack speed ability only 200%
spoiler: your whole college funds that your parents saved up for you
OJ DO LVL 15 MIRRORED CARDS OP
It’s so weird seeing OJ actually needing cards
This is exclusive 🔥
Is this game a pay to win now ?  - OJ : hold my orange juice 👌
🦖
"Potential satisfaction guaranteed! "
e
🌝
GOOD men  Yes Yes 🤩🤩
My favourite champion I the knight jis dash is op
oj: we gotta abuse her me: 👀WHAT DID HE SAY
If you are lucky enough, you can max out a hero without spending any
Oj : it’s over it’s over 12:50  Arrows : imma end this mans whole career
nicee
Can we just agree that when OJ uploads it makes all of our days better.
It’s a oj

When he got his last archer queen for level 13 I was play botw and thought it was my game and not the video lol
This would have been over $1000 if not for the book of books lol
Your lucky I suck at clash Royale
69$ x 69
Nobody: Supercell: S K E L E T O N K I N G
Woah f2p ded
Hope they gonna add a book of champions and champion wild card
I really love it when the notification says "someone liked your comment" and "someone subscribed to your channel"..
I don't like skeleton king because it has kinda low hit points (level 6 giant has more hp) and has a 2 elixir ability
The most satysfying video in the planet
3:21 lol 🤣
