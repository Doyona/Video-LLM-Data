Spencer looks like JD Vance
For me, SPENCER was GOATED in this one!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!
I have a very similar blink tick (pretty hard and always has to be 4 or sets of 4). Something about those jokes made me feel less weird about it.
Don’t even like jojos but holy shit dio Shayne is fkn hilarious
This is Olivia's finest work!
And without hesitation, both times
Please bring this character back 🤣🤣 14:19
Amanda's character perfectly depicts the "hungover heavy-eyed cis white male agent" persona incredibly well, I forgot it was her
Amanda's AL Pacino should be revisted.
Olivia’s bit was gold
0:20 Rachel 3:48 Olivia 7:46 Spencer 10:58 Amanda 16:18 Shayne 20:09 Tommy 22:42 Matthew  27:44 Damien
one of the BEST most IMPRESSIVE Amanda performances she's so fucking skilled and hilarious it's awesome
Can't believe Shez is fucking dead
This is by far the best funeral episode. Damien is a fantastic sport. I think he is so funny, so witty, and his timing is *chef’s kiss*
Everyone did so well but shayne steals the thunder. Liv and Amanda were just as good.
DIO Shayne made me breakout in uncontrollable laughter. It also made my break out in prayer for the first time in my life because it was so divine, the Lord must have bestowed it upon us (jk Shayne just abso-fucking-lutely killed it).
damien is my favourite omg i wish autistic people were real
i hope they're inviting damien to stuff now :/
I was so floored by the Voice Acting Agent but the tragedy of it is that it's completely over shadowed by Dio Shane. What an episode!
"Froze to death on a boat fire "
AMANDA that was incredible. Compelling, hilarious, sweet. It had it all. I was immersed🤩
Shayne dio is wiiilllddd
16:22 shayne's bit had me rolling
11:14 this amanda character is a big hear-me-out (amanda come back the kids miss u)
??? What happened at 27:35 lmao
I’m back for more Amanda. We miss you ❤
Amandas character acting is amazing
This goes into the top 10 Shayne clips
Shayne’s commitment to the character with the nails and top and cloak is wild
Amanda is so talented 🥹
holy fucking shit the meme review in that one assumptions video was NOT lying this shit is brutal and honestly hard to watch but in a fun way it's like a horror movie
Lyme disease for my ticks!!! MIC DROPP
Danggggg Damien came for them he was waaaaaiting for this moment and I’m so here for it tbh this is healthy lol
Honestly Damien is someone who I probly have the least amount of agreements on morals and views on things in life but I feel like we’d be good friends despite it all I like him it’s strange how I’d want to be friends with him although he’s not someone who has anything in common with me
Damien telling spencer to shut up when everyones jokes were about Damien not shutting up lmao, brother look in the mirror
This is such a good way of making fun of a super performative person, I'm taking notes
omg amanda KILLED
I loved Tommys roast. The salut and the snapps touched me.
The Olivia one made me really uncomfterable.
i love shayne even more after this holy shit, he was already my fav smosh person but this finalized it BAHAHAHA
Spencer knocked this out of the park omg
Tommy slayed with his first Damien-ism. Shane’s white blood cell line was kind of perfect, as well. 5 out of 5 stars, gentlemen.
2:18 she left smosh right?
im from the 8th of the audience that liked shaynes bit
This is how I learned who played Shez in Fire Emblem
Spencer absolutely slew this, holy 😂❤
Anyone else think the opening music sounds like it's saying "Damien phosphorus"?
“Dio Shayne isn’t real he can’t hurt you.” Dio Shayne:
Omg Spencer 😆 water gun Kelly? “hims was such a hekkin good boi.”? 💀
The squirrel bit was odd
Why is spencer dressed up as Charlie Kirk
I choose to believe Courtney wasn’t on screen in this episode because Shayne’s costume made them drool
I was crying laughing at this whole video 😂 loved it
Amanda looks like the guy that plays Dr Phil here lol
Jokes aside, Shayne is SO sexy as Dio it’s insane
Why did the saxophone guy not say anything did i miss something?
this was such a good video i should watch more of the funerals!
not the mic being unplugged xD Shayne killed the persona wow! sooooo well done
22:43 is one of my favorite bits. EVER.
Are the squirrels a reference to something or is it just a random thing that is happening here...? Like i need to know lol
Lol youtube pops up the skip/jump section suggestion for Olivia's whole bit
Racheal's eulogy - Proof autism, is nothing to laugh at.
god this funeral was so good. NO NOTES. the roasts, the comeback at the end oh man
kono SHAYNE da! 💫
this is the hottest shayne has ever been to me
oh sorry im new here and just realizing Shayne is kindof a baddiieeeee
Boycott HP, Disney, Kardashians/Jenners and Netflix🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
i'm so confused by how hot i find shayne in this
Sometimes I come back to this video just to hear Rachel tell Damien he needs to fuck an old clown. Her face just after the delivery is everything (also tommy's laugh is INFECTIOUS)
this was gold
And I read “Damian has dead.”
I’m still in so much confusion from Matthew’s bit
Spencer is insane
The voice actor agent looks so much like Ted Mosby
10:02 BRUTAL 😂😂😂
Shayne as DIO was CRAZYYYY 😭😭😭😭
Damian is too hot to die 😭 ❤
I'm sorry but this absolutely tops Shaynes funeral. Sucks that Damien had to die for everyone to finally get funny
few minutes in and.. strong start
Seeing the thumbnail made me happy in a very acoustic way
Shayne being Dio is too good to handle bruhh
“I’m autistic and also a bitch.” I need that on a shirt. And a travel mug. As an auDHD person who doesn’t like most people, I felt seen. 😂  Also, some of these comments don’t pass the vibe check. Ignore the haters.
11:01 omg is that ron staedtler from the hit series inside job
damn rachel got his ass.
Spencer was WILD, holy hell. absolutely slaughtered the entire time.
Tommy showing the straights how to slay a roast when they’ve all ALREADY been in beast mode is honestly what gives me the most Pride in our community 😌🫶🏻✨
Spencer came out the gates SWINGING lmao
Shayne’s makeup was so beautiful omg
god i miss rachel 💔
Damien's hair is purple though??
“It really was in the blink of both eyes really hard.” Lives in my head rent free 😂😂😂
Damien I love Damien
Im way too sensitive 😅 I just found most of this kinda mean
16:26  My first thought: Ok it's the grim reaper.. Oh My god is Shayne Brando
Oh that’s where that sound came from 😂
I've somehow never been more attracted to Shayne
it's concerning to me how much shayne looks like courtney with a wig and an eyeliner
Shayne is so hot in this one
We really need a reappearance of Anime Shayne one of these days 🤣
shayne is the best
Spencer held NOTHING back lmao
Shayne’s abs are amazing
0:41 not one minute in and laughing my ass off🤣🤣
That squirrel bit was so bizarre 😂
lmao i JUST got the “women in STEM” joke 😂 tommy is so smart. it took me months but i’m finally here
Kimmy over here being told how pretty she is in a video she isn't even in. God damn it she's pretty. 😍😍😍😍
DAMIEN ATE!!!!!
loving the "colourful haired guy blinks aggressively" representation  - a pink haired guy who blinks aggressively
Why was Amanda's character kinda hot 😭😂
20:04 I'm the eighth of the audience.
Okay, but whoever did Shayne’s hair, makeup and costume for Dio hit it out of the park. 10/10 Shayne looks straight out of an anime 😂
I think Damien is so sexy
Watching the other funerals I don't think the crew laughed as hard or were as brutal as they were here.
Shez!
Holy cow. Shayne's performance was so amazing. That DIO cosplay was near perfect.   Well done Shayne!
Shayne playing Dio is always top tier
I saw Shayne as Dio, I clicked SO FAST-
This video is giving me reason to live thank you all
I came here just for Shayne dressed as Dio, 100/10
God damn Amanda is such a good character actor ….that was amazing 😂
This one was the best one!!!Everyone nailed it!! 😂😂😂😂
i thought shane was cosplayimg courtney
This is the first funeral video I've seen and they are brutal
5:52 damn
Shayne was absolutely amazing
Amanda needs to do the Damien's Agent character even in non-Damien related videos.
Started out with autism denying. Jesus christ. Hope she never works again.
I watched this when I first didnt know much about Damien a few months ago, and now I'm rewatching after 1000 of previous smosh videos and the references make way more sense. Everyone was a showstopper and this felt like such a comfortable shoot because they all loved Damien. He also came in so hard at the end there. I can't tell how much of that was pre-written or improv, but either way it was flawless and so charmingly hilarious. i love this guy
I love how we can hear Shayne long before we see him.
Opening with Mozart was appropriate
Why did Shayne sound like Hisoka (from Hunter x Hunter) and All Might (from My Hero Academia) mixed lol?!
I’ve been watching through a bunch of funerals and oh my god I think yhe whole crew was gonna die of laughter
shaynes character study abilities will never not crack me up bc literally why
Shayne's character is the best thing I've seen from him. Fuckin incredible
does anyone know y they stopped funeral roasts was it any particular reason or it js came to a natural end? Either way it’s been my Roman empires for a while lol PETITION FOR THEM TO BRING IT BACK FOR NEWER CAST MEMBERS PLS
WAIT IS THIS WHERE THE ‘I’m autistic and also a bitch’ SOUND COMES FROM????? Or was she just referencing it???
Rachel, you SAVAGE! 😂
"I know we've all been devastated since Damien froze to death in that boat fire" had me rolling omfg
BRING BACK THE FUNERAL ROAST, Smosh!
Seeing Shayne in a bunch of other roles: okay yeah hes a good actor but I dont see the big deal Seeing Dio Shayne: Oh actually he is a god tier actor. The posing. The voice. Staying in character the entire time. The amount of PRACTICE this had to take. Insane
As foretold, the black smoth cometh
DIO Shayne has finally convinced me to watch Jojo. What a great roast.
Yoo I have that same heartless shirt! Fits the occasion :3
Damien haas died guys, so sad.......did u see my pun......?
Amanda was channeling Chris Farley, major Farley energy. Definitely needs to make another appearance.
19:09 MUDA MUDA MUDA
17:44 Shayne, a national treasure!
He died in the blink of both eyes really hard 😭🙏
shayne absolutely ATE with those nails
Spencer took no fucking prisoners 😭😭😭
Damien is the only person who didn't even try to sit still or pretend to be dead at his funeral lol
Dio Shayne is fucking insane and hilarious
I love u guys!!!!! Such a big fan 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Shayne looks so pretty as Dio
I’m autistic and he’s on autism TikTok 😆😆
8:01 Just your friendly reminder Marsha P Johnson was a self-identified male crossdresser who has openly admitted, on camera, that he was NOT at Stonewall until after the riot already started. Please educate yourselves kids :)
I love that Shayne is sitting in the back like a sith lord for most of the video until his grand reveal
Damn augustus was Olivia s character
I for one I'm a bit glas Rachel is gone
Damn Rachel just like me fr fr
2years later and i still watch this video when i have a hard day 😂
20:10 holy s
Yall are SLEEPING ON AMANDAS BIT
Ngl shayne looking kind of....
Hey, I’m autistic too…and a bitch so nothing to worry about
I was part of the audience that loved the Dio bit lol
21:59 I feel like this joke flew over way to many peoples heads 😭
Anime Shayne is so conflicting……
Damien's Voiceover Manager was absolutely inspired.
Damien’s “I got Lyme disease from all the tics I have.” — top tier!
My god, Damien is sooo good at roasting his friends back too…
Shayne missed the chance to say: "you thought it was Shayne, BUT IT WAS ME DIO"
I come back to watch shayne's every few months. Probbaly my favorite smosh moment
Amanda as Damien’s agent is so underrated! She killed it!
I was diagnosed with ocd and a subset of autism so I too show a lot of the symptoms of asd as well.
I can tell that first girl really makes mental disorder her entire personality.
I had no idea this is where that tik tok sound came from
Shayne Looks a lot like Courtney here no disrespect to court
Amanda was incredible. I could watch hours of her playing this unhinged character. 🙌🏻
GOOD GOD SPENCER
Oh my God Spencer KILLED
Was this roast in good fun, or did it cross any lines? Curious how Damien would’ve felt about it. Thoughts?
Damien's jokes at the end we're absolute fire!
Damien has Haas died. I mean Died Haas has Damien.
"There's no alcohol, no caffeine, and no bitches" killed me 😂
Spencer's set was SAVAGE  I LOVED IT 🤣
0:22 Comedy by Accident is the best. 16:28 😂 16:55 🤣🤣 17:28😂🤣 19:03 😂🤣🤣
I love Tommy’s bit too! ❤
Who gave Shayne the right to slay so hard???
OMG best funeral yet. Shane wins. ❤🎉
I started drawing everyone while I was watching the video. I did NOT KNOW I had to draw Shayne as Dio 💀💀💀🙏🙏🙏
16:27 "Wryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy" "It is I, Dio!"
its too bad he was a guy cause we need more women in STIM????  i think tommy is a genius
amanda and shane LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO
Shane slayed that though
I always come back to Dio Shayne
7:05 This whole part is too relatable
Everyone is moaning about Damien not playing dead but personally I always wondered how the rest could stand to not watch the bits so it just makes sense to me 😅
"I'm autistic and also a bitch" god that was so good
Spencer is the goat
shame on the editor for not adding anime sound effects into the video xD
hmm.. Shayne (Dio) gets Damien's body in the will, he died in a boat fire.. WAIT A MINUTE, THIS IS JUST PHANTOM BLOOD!
After hearing Damian’s roommates story, Damian’s main in marvel rivals is for sure squirrel girl 😂 also his voice is giving Schmidt from new girl vibes
Still one of the best funerals roast to date
shayne was really feeling himself in the outfit, and i cant blame him
I'm obsessed with Dio Shayne
This wasn't a roast they threw that man into the sun geez lmao.
I fully believed that Amanda was just young David Bowie for way too long
I absolutely need more people talking about Amanda's section - her bit was INCREDIBLE! The planning, the comedy, and the commitment to the character is genuinely impressive
bro i hate dio so much but shayne made me appreciate the fact that smosh invented jjba just for this bit
I can't help but notice that any voice Amanda does is damn near the same and always shows off that jiggly double chin.
Well it went from roasting to actual wth
2:37 Rachel missed the chance to say; "Like himself"
I really wish they would bring back Amanda’s agent character in something!
I love damien on this channel :>
SHAYNES DIO IMPRESSION IS SO FIRE OMG?
Absolute shayme
Why the f*ck is Shayne so fricking good as DIO?! 😂😂 I need more of this 😂
I dont usually find Olivia that funny but she absolutely killed this, that was hilarious
15:04 god Amanda does characters so well 16:54 holy shit Shayne, he is hitting the anime vibes so perfectly Edit 18:27 watching again this is still amazing character. I’ve since watched a couple hundred episodes of OnePiece and this legit could be a character in the show, gestures and all
spencer looks so different. he ages well.
Everyone killed in this one.
The blink of both eyes very hard is one of the best jokes ever written.
Y’all know exactly why I keep coming back to this video
STOP STOP HE'S ALREADY DEAD
THE NAILS. SHAYNES NAILS…
The funny thing is Rachel's roast of him being "autistic" can apply to 90% of the people who say that they are autistic. Rachel seems very autistic herself...
Is this where the 'I'm autistic and also a bitch' tiktok sound comes from?
16:23 I died when shayne came out cosplay as dio 😂😂😂
Damien's funeral roast, when Damien Roasts them all back
16:19 this is for me.
This is how you know Damien is Shayne’s best friend bc that’s so much effort and spectacle to go through
Didn't get the squirrel guy
Shayne put his entire dio bussy in this. Fucking insane
I love Damien/the persona he wears for smosh. And you can tell by these intricate roasts that his friends love him so much ❤️
2 years later and I’ve watched this video almost as much as the INSIDE the Bo Burnham special… Thank you for this comfort giggle fest 😊
I didn't get shit the squirrel story, what is that supposed to mean?
i also do the face scrunching and ive never heard of someone else who does it this is crazay i love you damien
19:36 omg! Shayne is hilarious
That squirrel deal was lame as f
spencer is genuinely hilarious 😭😭😭
"I'm autistic and also a bitch." has been my favorite phrase since I first saw this❤😂 Accurately describes me
Holy shit Amanda was amazing 😂😂😂
i love how open damien is abt his audhd+ocd combo, i have the same and it’s so helpful and hopeful to see someone living their best life and being comfortable and happy, our brains are exhausting and overwhelming it can be so hard to enjoy the moment but he does
0:41 I LOVE THAT THIS IS WHERE THE IM AUTISTIC AND ALSO A BITCH SOUND ON TIKTOK CAME FROM AAHHHHH RACHEL YOYRE AN ICON
Why is Dio Shayne kinda...
amanda rocked this episode
i rewatch this so often for Amanda's amazing impression as Damien's voiceover agent. this is truly one of her top moments on Smosh lmao. she nailed it so well! the exasperation, the dedication, the passion!
im crying about how much dedication and love Shayne has for Damien. True Best Friends. <3
It's soooo funny😂
i thought that shayne was courtney in the thumbnail for a second
Looking back on this, Amanda's character work knocked it out of the park. You almost couldn't see it was her under there.
The stare of Amanda and Olivia at 8:15
10:05
ok but why is nobody talking about how good shayne looks in that outfit? THE NAILS?!?!!
Amanda look like my unc that smokes newports and drinks miller lite
19:20 lol
I'm LOVING all of the so random! references !!!!!
Could’ve done without the zombie bit
Can I just say that one thing I appreciate about Damien - and I mean this genuinely - is that even after so many jokes about his "virtue signalling," he still ends with saying "Don't come for Rachel, she cleared these jokes with me first."   One could be inclined to react to that with eye rolls, like "oh no, Damien you're doing the thing! Nobody asked and you're still saying that stuff!" But I thought about it for a minute and realized that Damien doesn't care if he's perceived as virtue signalling because even though he knows he's a straight white guy with a ton of privilege, he's NOT saying that stuff for clout. He actually believes it's important even if he gets made fun of for doing it.   A virtue-signaller would stop if they felt they weren't getting the praise they were fishing for. Damien's willing to take one for the team though, and be the "annoying justice guy" because he actually cares about what he's saying. Even if the execution can be a bit over the top, he thinks it's more important to try and get roasted than not to try at all.   I believe Damien about his values and I don't think he's being fake. I think he's just an awkward dude who is doing his best, and I appreciate him.
16:20 just fast forward to the best part.  You can thank me later
Shane DIO gets included in so many compilations, but the whole video is wall to wall excellent bits
26:56
god dio shayne is so gorgeous
I love Damien. I adore him. An icon for neurospicy folks like me.    But...I won't lie...Shayne making me feel some kinda way...
18:00 Shayne put two more people in a casket here omg
Amanda slayed this
DIO SHAYNE TOPPS
I cant tell if Amanda is in Brad Garrett or Nick Cage (Leaving Las Vegas) Drag
They need to bring back the character of Damien‘s agent Amanda’s amazing as his agent
"in the blink of both eyes really hard" actually made me cackle as someone with eye twitches lmaooo
Amanda killed that agent
Dio Shane is everything to me actually
I gotta say I think damian and shayne are probably the coolest, most genuine human beings on the planet. I would do extremely questionable things to have a friendship like theirs/friends like that or hangout with them. Just a thought while watching, not specific to this video lol
Shayne is so fucking GOOD
hims was such a heckin good boi (>_<)
Does the rest of the cast really invite everyone but Damien to pool parties? 😢
The nails!!!❤
Look how freaked out Amanda looks after something broke after the first 20 seconds 😂
Spencer is so funny,
OMG I'M FAN GIRLING OVER SHANE DIO. HOLY SHIT
Is it possible to have funeral characters in a board game. Plssss. Like Damien's Voice acting agent....we need him back....and Dio...pls... Funeral reunion plsssss
Ever since I started watching Smosh (not that long ago), I've been thinking, does Damien know that he's autistic? He's my type of autistic, where understanding people, self development and communication are special interests. Because they're not seen as unusual interest, and it leads to having a pretty convincing mask, we go undetected unless we actually describe the way or inner thoughts are experineced to a psychologist
wait shayne looks SO good like that
Augustus is like a goat in human form
amanda as a stressed agent is so hot actually
WOMEN IN STIM NJDBSH
Amanda killed on this
shayne embodied pure autism in this one 😂😂 and killed it 🔥
OH MY GOD DIO SHAYNE
Damien kiiiillleed the comebacks
I couldn't take my eyes off the screen when Spencer , Amanda and shayne were doing their bits. Damn that was epic❤😮
I love how you can still hear Shayne's rich person laugh even when he's under the cloak and you don't know who it is yet but you do because of the laugh
Rachel is a POWERHOUSE
This is my favorite Amanda character
I LOVE DIO SHAYNE! That entire bit was friggin amazing! 🤩
"in the blink of both eyes really hard" is a hard ass bar
Amanda in this character looks exactly like Mark Duplass💀💀💀
Shayne is just the best
Augustus was BRUTAL.
More than s year later, i can finally say that I'm glad Rachel is gone.  Gatekeeping autism isn't a joke; it happens too much in real life.
Matthew Scott is a treasure
Spencer is insane
kono shayne da
22:46 for people who don't get the blink joke
Fucking DIO SHAYNE is something I will never ever be able to forget.
Shayne has made me laugh so much over the years, but it's hard to imagine anything ever topping this. I was clutching my stomach in pain from laughing so much. Goddamn.
I like how the bouquet is a spinach 🥬😆😂
Damien is SO HOT
okay but why is Shane as Dio so fucking hot.. lmaooo
Spencer that was savage xD
wait... they said P*ssy and didn't bleep it? huh?
I swear I’m gonna get abs from laughing, oh my god
if this was made a bit later Rachel could of said, I'm autistic, he voices Laios in dungeon meshi
Jesus Shayne being this unhinged is always a treat
Scott was mid, compared to the others.
I like Olivia, she's funny.
one of the funniest motherfuckers on smosh
1 year later and Dio Shayne still hits hard.
a terrible darnasty secrety
The Dio part was FREAKIN AWESOME
Spencer was the best, by far
I like how Rachel made all those autism jokes like they don’t also apply to her 😂
Olivia’s work is under appreciated here she’s so funny
I had forgotten how brutal this roast was... Jesus.
ok but why is gender bent Amanda so crazy attractive?
Spencer's opening joke went so hard, so fast.
Ngl, Shayne kinda sounds like All Might 16:50
I'm that 8th if the audience
damn shayne it was a roast not a scorch
DIOOO????
That "you would love it" was savage.
I love how Matthew Montgomery is here but everyone talk about Dio Shayne. It’s nice to see him outside of Disney, always loved his sketches in Disney shows
The dio part killed me
Tommy during Shayne's monologue: "I bet I could convert him. He's sooooo close. Just a little shove.."
I️ feel like no one is talking about how good Amanda’s character and bit were, TOO GOOD.
Does Rachel have the Hedwig and the Angry Inch tattoo? I've got it on my wrist 💜
The fact that Shayne's bit did not end with a Yes song is such a missed opportunity.
Dio Shane rules
game recognizes game 29:46
Mirror mirror on the wall, olivia is by far the lamest on smosh of all .....
16:18 "You thought Shayne was going to roast you... But it was I! Dio!!"
Damien’s voiceover agent looks like a Mexican version of my old boss. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 11:14 to 16:14
Tommy:”amen,awomen, anon-binary friends” was so funny Tommy will always make a comeback with LGBTQIA+ jokes
Hobbit Spencer is a bit I absolutely need now
Tommy takes the stand and everyone starts sweating
I think Olivia- I mean Augustus- missed the memo where Damien was already dead, and just proceeded to straight-up murder him with the cat comment.
If Damien does skin Shayne and wear him as a suit, then Shane Topp would truly be living up to his name in a whole new gruesome way
This is still one of the best roasts to date
THE 1/8TH OF THE AUDIENCE HAS BEEN REACHED 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭ROTFL
This is the best roast of all time!! 😂
3:12 Shayne’s laugh booming from the void 😂😂
Wide
Shayne ate tho
Olivia was WAITING for this moment
10:00 WATER GUN KELLY KILLED ME 😂😂
Guess I'm part of the eighth, I loved Dio Shayne
Wait… I’m autistic and also a binch… is this where the viral audio comes from? 😮
Who’s that guy?
Shayne😭
I just saw this for the first time and learned some things about myself seeing Shayne’s bit
I dont get the squirrel bit but it made me laugh
YASSS AMANDAAAAAA
Omg Olivia's bit was so perfect and well written😂
Looking like DIO in that thumbnail
Is that thumbnail shayne or Courtney???
Shayne had wayyyy too much fun with this role😂😂😂 and he KILLED in those nails! Slay sweetie 💅🏾🙌🏾
I have never laughed so hard as I did at Amanda's impression of Damien's voice over agent
OMG THE CANDYLAND DISS LMAO. I didn't realize he meant Lord Licorice.
Matthew Scott is a national treasure
“there’s no alcohol. there’s no caffeine. and there’s no bitches” 😭😭😭😭😭
As usual, skipping 3:48-7:48
Holy shit how have I watched this video but not to the Dio Shayne part. The costume, the poses, the voice, the roasts everything was fucking perfect. Courtney’s husband is hot af gotDAMN. I wish we could see more lol
wow, Courtney's husband is jacked
Why DioShayne just the hottest lol
Shayne's DIO voice is better than the official English dub. There, I said it.
This is one of my all time fav smosh videos. Just insanely well produced and the jokes are incredible
32:39 hahahahahahahaha thats really funny
rewatching this a year or so later and Rachel's bit about Damien being "as autistic as ____" made my jaw drop so hard and for so long that the underside is still cramping 😭😭😭😭😭
“I’m autistic, and also a bitch” - Rachel Evans 0:44
this is by far the best funeral roast. shit went hard
“Im autistic and also a bitch.” me too 😔
Ngl, Dio  Shayne is kinda hot. 😂😂
as an 8th of the audience, I can confirm I did love that.
They shouldve had brock baker with the Goofy puppet roasting Damien 😅😂😂
Autism is an adults choice to be a child. Stop it
Y'all having to constantly defend Rachel for her super outta touch and downright shitty takes is corny.  Other then that 10/10
Funny looking at it now with Damien’s autism diagnosis 💀
12:19 amanda looks like spencer from icarly
THIS WHOLE VIDEO IS A jjba reference
This is the hottest Shayne has ever looked lmao
Still the greatest roast so far. The characters? Mwah
Rachel is super hot!
I actually had trouble breathing from laughing so much at Shayne
This is my hundredth time watching but; day IDK of asking for a "Who Said That" segment because "Amanda is just Olivia with all the sliders turned to max" is SO wildly accurate.. 😂
The first girl w autism is CAKED UP 😮
Okay but Olivia and Rachel started off SO strong 😂😂😂 Honestly everyone absolutely killed it. Banger after banger.
I'm 1/8 of your audience. That was awsome
In the blink of both eyes very hard is iconic
Amanda looks like Dollar General Robert Downey Jr.
Tommy takes the cake 😭😭☠️
Tommy's line "Shayne will receive Damien's untransformed body so Shayne can get his rib back" IS FREAKING INSANE.  I saw Damien's first ever video on Smosh and they introduce Damien as "shaynes friend" so Tommy's analogy to adam and eve is  willlldd
Shayne as DIO should be canon
Is it just me or does Amanda low-key look like Jimmy Fallon as a man 🤣
tommy's roasts are always my favorite
This is my comfort funeral… is that weird to say? I’ve definitely watched it the most 😅
Tsugi wa jotaro!😈  Kisama-do : JoJo:yarō....Dio!😡 I love  that shayne picked dio as Damien is into anime and so is he😂👍❤️
Matthew Scott Montgomery such drunk Moira Rose energy in this video it's crazy.
That Damien pic - reminds me of Merrick Hannah.
Shayne's character was great- BUT HIS NAILS ??? LIKE DAMN BRO
Can we talk about how Shayne just looks like Courtney but shredded
DIO SHAYNE, I LIVE FOR DIO SHAYNE
Anime Femboy Shayne is doin something for me
Spencer, guy of all time
Amanda is so funny 😂
20:03 I'M THE EIGHTH OF THE AUDIENCE WHO LOVED THAT !!!! I LOVE SMOSH AND JJBA shayne as dio was the greatest thing of my life (also his "hm" were *so* in character I crylaughed. actually everything was so in character, he did an amazing job)
5:10 the jon hamm one caught me off guard omg 😭😭
Finding Damien has/had ocd harms my heart. You never think someone cool like him could suffer from something you do as well. When you have ocd is easy to be in your head and think there's nobody else going through that. It's so shameful and you feel like a bad person. That's why it's so important to be vocal about these kind stuff, so people won't feel so alone anymore.
Tommy* Amanda Spencer Damien Shayne Rachel Olivia MSM
Damian is so cute❤
I’ll be real I don’t get the squirrel bit
Tommy and Spencer laughing at Amanda is the kind of joy I want for my actual funeral😂
shayne as dio brando is the hardest i've ever laughed at a smosh video. i constantly come back to watch the clip. he played the part fabulously
13:00
I knew Shayne went to the gym but DAAAAAMN
This is some of Amandas best work
God Damian is so fine
16:15 - 20:05 Dio Shayne roast for fellow anime people.
THis was the HARDEST roast in history!
Amanda fucking cooked Damien😂
*the 1/8th of the audience that loved that*
Amanda absolutely won this
This is up there with the funeral roast of Anthony
"i got lyme disease from all the tics i have" absolutely killed me as someone who also has tics 🤣🤣
I sincerely thought it was Courtney in the thumbnail for WEEKS then I watched the video and would like to apologise
i love that we live in an era where you can roast someone for not being autistic
OMG YES JOJO ROAST
Hey im that 1/8
Shayne is amazing. That was incredible, the layers.
I don't normally like Amanda but this was great.
Spencer’s roast was brilliant!
Damn.   I felt this savage roast all the way from the African continent 😂😂😂
Anime Shayne should be in more things
spencer’s whole speech is pure gold
Shayne’s squishy squishy squishy 🤣🤣🤣 tht needs to be a meme 🤣😂🤣
Dio Shayne is now my favorite character of his, after dumpster wizard.
Rewatching this and just realising Patrick is wearing a Damien wig ahahaha
1st time watching these and 20:14 made me died laughing 😅 that is pure comedy also spencers was made for these omg 😂😂😂 and shayne jojo posing , everything about this is just peak 😂
Watching Amanda so deep in character is honestly enthralling, she’s such an incredible actor
Amanda’s Voice agent bit was LEGENDARY
Shayne was cooking in the back for a while. He looking like griffith after 😢 nvm bad example.
I'm sorry, but 20:14 is the best joke I have heard in ANY of these videos.
i need shane to be dio, again. i need it so bad.
Anyone else notice Damien chilled after his funeral?
I love Amanda
Shayne 😍🥵 😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵😍🥵
This funeral and Amanda's are top tier
Shayne's DIO was hilarious, but it felt more like Maximillion Pegasus
Spencer going on a run of some of the sickest burns in ANY of the funeral videos😂
I’ve never heard of a funeral with a live cremation before
Got owned by asian girl lol
i fucking LOVE amanda
shayne looks so fucking incredible like mama those nails???? slay queen
Spencer was made for this. wtf
My favorite Shayne character... "squishy squishysquishysquishysquishysquishysquishy squishy"
for some reason Shayne looked so pretty here goddamn 22:00
shayne portrayed dio so well i felt like i was watching the actual anime LMAO
WHY IS SHANE THE PERFECT DIO
"Siberian Desert"???????
Does Damien silent laugh or are they muting his mic? If so that's sad
Amanda really killed it here 😂
I love that when Shayne was hiding you could still recognise his laugh 😂
I'm part of that 8th ❤❤❤😂😂😂
Damien's psychology degree joke on shayne did NOT age well
What was sax man even there for? Was his bit cut or something?
One of the best roast episodes imo. Everyone just nails it and Damien’s counter roast is so good. I’m crying laughing so much. Gotta highlight Spencer’s brutal roasts, Amanda’s performance and obviously Dio Shayne. Boy really milked the scene 😂
Amanda makes a hot dude.
its crazy that all they could collectively joke about was damien not being an asshole to a majority of the population
I feel like Damien was trying so hard not to cry through half of this but maybe it was just me crying
Coming from southeast Georgia that eats squirrels because it's like kangaroo to Australia 😅
Shayne cackling under the cloak gives me life. This video is incredible, everyone killed!! Also I love that Damien didn't even try to stay in character lmao
Shayne even wore nails for it
WRYYYYYYYYAAAAAAaaaa
This was the ultimate competition in one-upping each other. Holy fucking shit.
Can someone explain the joke at 20:15?
IM AUTISTIC AND ALSO A BITCH 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯💯💯💯🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺
Good to know every group has a Grant O’Brian.
I love that one of the few things that visibly seemed to bother him was when Olivia called his cat "mid".
The "virtue signaling" jokes are overkill. Like, I get two or three jokes about it, but it just keeps going. I'm confused, it's not like the rest of the team loves to offend
Shayne should have said "he really meant THE WORLD to me"
I have no idea who any of these people are, but this is fun.
God Rachael is insufferable
I don't want to see Shane doing any other character ever again
WAS THAT A GOOD OMENS REFERENCE
Not the Halloween at 31 😂
if i was not already gay Dio shayne would definatly have turned me XD
19:41 my uh friend... wants book shayne to role play this like for a party while guests throw money at him similar to drag queens and exotic dancers again asking for a friend if anyone has his booking email lmk 😂😂😂
liv ate with this one
❤absolutely fucking unhinged 😂❤
NGL DIO Shayne is doing something for me 😂
Rachel destroyed it. She's brilliant! Everyone in the audience DIED
Timestamps 00:18 - Rachel Evans 03:50 - Augustus (Olivia) 07:48 - Spencer Agnew 10:59 - Damien's Voice Agent (Amanda) 16:17 - DIO Shayne (Shayne) 20:07 - Tommy Bowe 22:41 - Matthew Scott Montgomery 27:43 - Damien's Rebuttal
💜💜💜
This was ass
Rachael was UNHINGED from the first second
Olivia's roast was just her honest opinion delivered as a funny character lol
Amanda is giving Shane Dawson, and it's even funnier bc she has no idea
shayne with the nails and cropped topp (sorry couldn’t resist) was so cool pls marry me
can someone explain the joke abt Shayne getting his rib back? I'm so confused 😂
So many roasts in one video 😂
Damien and Garret's roasts were the best and most brutal
Olivia's performance as Augustus in this is so slept on
Olivia was just adam Sandler lmao
DIO SHAYNE DESTROYED ME
The first thing that I liked about Damien (despite the fact that we both apparently make the same "terrible" fashion choices lol) was that he was the first ever person I've seen to blink like I do 😅😂  I was so excited lmao. I was seriously like, "Oh my god! Other people do that too??? It's not just me?!" Made me feel so much better about myself and something I've always been super self-conscious about. After watching this and many other Smosh videos now, I'm realizing that we're actually a lot alike lol. So now he just feels extremely relatable, but I still can't get over the fact that we both have that same tic. I've never seen anyone else do it, even to this day and I'm now 32 years old. 😁
18:56 - 19:04 my favorite roast out of all of them 😂
I loved Dio Shayne because of how much he played in character 😭✋
Amanda killed it
Least talented member of smosh has the worst roast. Surprising nobody.
Why did shayne look damn good yk
I didn't realize Shane Dawson was gonna be in here
"Water-gun Kelly" is CRAZY
Shayne went all Patrick Seitz for DIO, and I love it
I needed this as much as the cast did. They have been putting up with his shit far too long, and now, a year or so later hes actually dragging things down.
This was my favorite funeral ❤
Never thought about how much I need Dio Shane until this video.
Why the fuck hasnt Keith had a funeral yet???!!!
this was such a good roast !! damiens counter was amazing, and so were tommys shaynes and amandas bits. i dont think anyones been roasted this hard ever but u can tell its out of love and that he loved it
Calling people a piece of Shit, is Shayne's love language
shayne is a national treasure god damn
Oh my gosh, Amanda is freakin phenomenal!!
Damien's list of the things you can't say explains why Shayne and Matthew's roast like that.
Actually died during Amanda's part. Just her appearance was enough lmaoooo
Amanda's physical acting is so incredible as this character I DIE
I didn't realize Damien's Agent was Al Pacino
lol
16:20 - Wait, is that Shayne or Courtney?
We love Damien💜
me and tommy are so similar. both enamored and strangely attracted to DIO Shayne
Damien seems to believe being white is a bad thing. Typical woke bigot.
GOODBYE DAMIEN
Rachel is awesome
Goddamn, Spencer killed it
I have that squishmallow!! Calio 🥹🥰
One of Olivia's best characters 😂❤
Shane actually slays so hard in that getup
28:41 I love how Shayne laughs in character here
11:10 - 16:13 Amanda’s bit was so good, I almost forgot it was all a skit 16:28 No. Way.
I miss Damien. Also, that’s Shayne’s best character performance. He should revive it.
I was hoping shayne was gonna go “Muda Muda Muda Muda Muda”
oh my god was that a jojo reference
I'm rewatching all the funerals and this might be the best one, everyone brought it so hard!
You Missed the Opportunity To Call the Video "Damien Haas It Dead." Get It? haas? Has?
why are there so many comments about Damien being considerate lol. it feels weird even for this series but maybe i haven’t seen enough. making fun of a person being considerate and thoughtful of pronouns and different cultures (only 2 of the things he was roasted for) feels wrong even for smosh
I can't get over "Being in half as many videos as me does not make you a minority", everything about that line is perfect
19:02 best part
I know nothing about Rachel, but did she throw herself in the middle of proverbial on coming traffic with that Clown comment? lmao
Why is 0:02 version of Damien fine as hell 😂
I never followed Damien's socials but he must have been pandering SUPER hardcore for them to go that hard on him
"Shayne was born white and wealthy in Florida and then immediately died white and wealthy in Florida." I don't know why, but jokes about this man drowning as an infant never fail to completely destroy my composure.
In Damien's defense, everyone at Smosh virtue-signals to some extent, some more than others (ie. Courtney and Shayne)
Amanda looks insane
19:02 squishy squishy squishy
matthew's bit was SO FUNNY, i was doubled over the whole time
Amanda is adorable 😍
Damien looks like he's holding onto the bouquet for dear life... or, I guess, dear death? You get the idea
Shayne is so perfect 😂
okay but like.. Rachel Evans might be my new favorite person on smosh and i want to see so much more of her. litterally she had me dying with her ripping into damien.
MORE JJBA!SHAYNE please lmaoooo <3
ZA WARUDO!!!
Shayne nailed it
This is why Shane is my favorite
Omg Shayne is so pretty in this! Makeup suits him lol
so good
here from the last smosh mouth episode where they talk about serving c*nt, and someone said shayne was serving here so i came back and HE WAS yesss
22:15 Sand people sounding ass
Matthew Scott what? Why?
Rachel has never displayed autistic traits at a level higher than damien so I really don't understand the autism gatekeeping jokes lol. If either one is actually autistic, they're obviously very high functioning and it's ultimately irrelevant.
This is so cool and so funny
This episode is so good!
Damien was right. As an eighth of Smosh's audience, I did love that
lmao the spencer roasts were too real and spot on
I forgot how to breathe correctly after Shayne’s whole skit. I laughed WAYYY harder and longer than I have in quite a long time. Perfection!!
HE'S SUCH A GOOD DIO STOP I'M CRYING THIS IS SENSATIONAL
spnecer on fire
Not me watching funeral roast content all this week to gear up for Anthony's funeral tomorrow 🎉 Also Amanda's character is my favorite thing ever.
Gatekeeping autism is actually next level disgusting
I’m new to the channel and didn’t know you were Autistic! As an Autistic, this makes you guys so much better in my brain 😂 also, why are you me with a different face ?? 😆
Kono dio Shayne 🥵
omg when she is in the audience Amanda looks so much like Jim from The Office I can't explain it
Amanda is incredible!! Banger after banger 👏👏👏
Rachel’s “I’m sorry that came off abrupt. I’m autistic. And a bitch.” Should be this decades slogan.
I love how they all checked with each other afterwards. Such a beautiful friendship
rewatching this before the anthony roast and just needed to say Shayne looks TOO good. impressive
"You thought you died from natural causes NO IT WAS ME DIO."
spencer violated him so hard ohnmy god and damn me too but DAMN
Shayne's character is just Courtney in a different font
I feel like Olivia doesn’t laugh at a lot of other ppls jokes because she’s jealous and really unfunny herself
SPENCER SENT ME IN THIS ONE LMAOOO
who up on they grub rn?
Spencer just nails it everytime. He makes it look easy 😆
I love Damien's laugh this whole video ❤ Amanda is so effing talented, and Tommy dying in the background was incredible
I would lose my mind if any of my friends cosplayed in a roast lmao
brutal lmao
So many great bits, but every single one of Tommy’s hit 😂
Augustus listing OCD traits is insane I was think she was in my brain
i need more Dio Shane
I don’t like Olivia she’s either fake laughing or looking like she thinks her jokes are better than everyone else’s. And not just in this video
Zombie Man Part 2
I've never seen a more accurate depiction of Dio 1000/10
SHAYNE AS DIO WAS INSANE
If anyone was offended by these roasts, please god never watch Kill Tony or any old Comedy Central Roasts lmao they will break your feeble mind
Damien was a much better sport than who was before him when he was roasted far harder lol.
I thought that the haas was a typo and they were gonna say “has died“ but thats his last name someone help! (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞
I'm not gonna lie this one. What's the most click Bay of all of no funeral roast? I just don't see why it's one was not the best.
16:26 KONO DIO DA!
I fucking loved Amanda the out of breath agent.
I'm confused...does Damien "want" Autism?
Amanda did phenomenal! Low key  Jimmy Fallon
16:18 - 20:10
Damien is my favorite
Wryyyyyy
the autism jokes are my fav 😂😂 (i’m autistic too)
I absolutely love a well put together roast, this was brilliant.
Shayne being Dio might be the best thing I’ve ever seen
he was gone in the blink of both eyes really hard
Who is this Matthew Scott Montgomery guy? Not seen him before
I just know Damien got confusing feelings seeing Shane looking like that
Shayne KILLED the anime role. Cast that boy in a live action.
The fact that Patrick(???) is holding a saxophone that doesn't have a mouthpiece is driving me crazy
Shane: *you were expecting an eulogy, BUT IT WAS ME DIO!*
Damien seems so exhausting to work/be friends with
This. This was the best one.
Shayne's nails are the best!
16:19, for anyone wondering
I love that Matthew Scott came.
Tommy's stimming jokes!
I adore Damien ❤
I haven’t heard the word woke this much since YouTube auto played a Ben Shapiro video
I love Shayne's Dio Impression. XD
I have to say that Rachel, Amanda, Olivia, and Shayne were my favorites. But fr, everyone was amazing 🔥!
I thought this was Courtney on the thumbnail. This is so disturbing how Shayne looks like her with makeup on.
Spencer always steels the spotlight for me 😂
Never thought there would be a day I would see Shayne with black nails a sports bra thing and eyeshadow 😂😂😂
My partner and I desperately need there to be a Phantom Blood live action movie with Shane as Dio.
shaynes cosplay is at peak preformance
Spencer is the Ricky Gervais of this. Hitting hard and living in it. He swung and hit nothing but home runs.
where is ian in this one(?)
this is one of shayne’s best looks, he’s so sassy with the acrylics i think he should wear them more often
Shayne fucking looks like Courtney with makeup on. Wth...
"I have lime disease from all my tics" Really got me, as someone who has a tic attack in a mental hospital and then the nurses drew my blood because they nothing about the type of tics i was talking about, long story shoer I was tested for lime disease and then had to have a long conversation with the doctors about what i meant
Amanda was giving such SNL vibes 😂😂😂 very Matt Foley😂
“Water gun Kelly” is phenomenal.  10/10 to Spencer
This is the best smosh roast of all time
OLIVIA IMPRESSIONS ARE ALWAYS AT POINT❤❤❤❤
Shayne was spitting 😭
when i’m depressed i come back to this just to watch DIO shane
i understand now. every minute of jojos my fiancé forced me to watch was preparing me to understand shaynes bit. it was all part of the training
my brain said "Damien has dead"
Im sorry whos the saxophone guy?
It's kinda funny that on other videos people are saying how brutal this was but here people are saying the cast clearly loves him lol. Like half of the roasts are just about how nice he tries to be. We love Damien.
amanda always makes me cry laughing
The taco bell line was a straight murder, the ian one really just shoveled the dirt on the grave
Olivia Augustus took him to the Crematorium!
Dio shayne gives me gender envy
Damn shane looks so beautiful here 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
I`m part of the eigth xD. Shaynes performance was AMAZING!
You can always count on Tommy to get a really good laugh out of everyone
Shayne is giving me bi panic please help
If you think a broken vase is bad luck,try breaking a condom....
Hahahahah the whole time I was thinking that someone should mention how hard he blinks and it happened and I nearly popped a blood vessel
Whoever played the manager. That was good. Dio was fucking genius.
I started screaming when I saw that DIO cosplay. He's so good. The voice. The poses. *the poses* I love it.
Shayne as Dio was the best thing that happened to me this year
Ohhh myyy goddd Spencerrrr went in hard I loved it ❤️
i had to take a double take when rachel evans came out cause i used to watch snarled lmao
Shayne not showing his face in the back for majority of the video
24:00 who the fuck is this and what is this bit
SHAYNE ❤❤❤❤
when his best friend  put on the recordings i cried in laughter  help 🤣😂😂
The squishy squishy squishy squishy got me 😂😂😂
I must say of all the cast, I think shayne is the best actor. He plays the role to the best of his ability and doesn’t break often. True professionalism.
Does anyone get the whole squirrel bit? Was it a reference to something or was it just a random bit he decided to go with?
Damn I mean Damien was alive when they started filming this but then they just roasted him alive for internet clout. What is society coming to?
Me: “Damien is probably my favorite cast member, he makes the weird offhand and quick references like I do.”  Damien: “I might have Autism!”  Me: *takes the RAADS-R* “Oh”
I’m sorry but Shayne and Spencer were the top stars in this one because god they were funny
16:24
Okay I knew I had seen Damien and Shayne somewhere other than YouTube and I was TODAY YEARS OLD when I realized/found out they were on so random!😱
Everyone brought their A game 😢  Damien would have been dead excited to hear them
Shayne and Spencer were freaking incredible, but Tommy killed it with ”It really was in the blink of both eyes really hard”! Not only was that just so smart, but it melts my heart they are all so open and understanding of these things.
Shayn'e magnum opus
Obsessed with Shayne as Dio omg
OMG ITS RACHEL FROM SNARLED????
god I keep rewatching this every two days
16:18  35:06
These bits really confirm Damian is as insufferable off camera as it seems
This may be the best roast I've ever watched
This honestly just made me love Damien even more
Damien definitely cried after this lol
"Jotaro,you are next"   -dio
😹😹I lost it at Shane’s dio
0:44 ME
YEAHHHHH DIO!
Holy shit. Damian had some fire comebacks too
i love how in all the other Smosh funeral videos the “dead” smosh member at least tries to act dead, but in this one Damien is just giggling and clapping like a toddler the whole time lmao
Why is Shane posing kinda 😏😏
Dude Damien is so fuggin funny. He absolutely killed me
Replay buttons for myself lol: Rachel: 0:36 DIO Shayne: 16:18 Damien: 27:43
Dude, Shayne’s Dio impersonation is INSANE
Dio cosplay was perfect
Amanda killed it!  She had me laughing so hard.
Dio Shayne can get it
Something tells me Shayne really liked having those nails 😂
I have never been more attracted to Shayne, lol
Damien almost single-handedly roasted them back harder than all of them did him 😂😂
Everyone was top notch for sure, but Amanda REALLY broke me :D She was waaaaay too hilarious here LOL
God, I love Spencer lol.
best jojo impression ever
it took me until tommy’s joke to realize where i knew rachel from,, literally my fav person in S4 😭🫶
21:59 I've thought about this every day since
Dunno if anyone noticed, but Amanda's joke about the desert is double layered, because there wouldn't be any camels in the siberian desert, it's an ice desert.
I hate every person take autism as a stupid joke 🤬! I m real autistic i don't find that funny! Wtf dude!
Dio Shayne was the best part of the video lmao 😂
Haha the best crew. I love ya damian. ❤❤❤❤❤
I can see Shane as a woman
I’m sorry you can see Spencer’s reflection in the frame of the podium and it made me laugh so hard
Rachel isn’t funny.
Ik this happened 9 months ago, but it would have been so funny for this funeral if it started playing the song Swing, Swing since it starts with the same music as they transition, since its Damien
"my coat tails can fly free" is such an eloquent slam
I can imagine shayne reciting his roast in his apartment for weeks
i'm so upset at how attractive dio shayne is HELP STOP ARGH HELP
who thought shayne was courtney for a milisecond
Had to pause the video, watch the first 4 episodes of the circle season 4 before coming back to finish the video
This was the best and the  funniest  funeral roast ever 😂
As an autistic person, I'm crying. all of these jokes were GOLD. 🤣🤣🤣
SHAYNE PUTANGINAAAAAAAA
Amanda truly is a gem 😂
I just realized Amanda can cosplay as Zachary Levi
Daddy shayne
Tommy was out for blood with that opening line my jaw DROPPED
JUST REAL QUICK I WANT EVERYONE TO LOOK AT SPENCERS REFLECTION IN THE BIG PICTURE INFRONT OF THE STAND
I love these they go harder then try not to laugh
Rachel's a /literal/ ghost buster the same way my 7 yr old cousin /literally/ gave himself a vaccine by saying, 'circle, circle, dot, dot, I now have a cootie shot'. She's so brave!
“You can’t eat squirrels!” Me: *stares in south Louisiana*
Anyone else think Dio Shayne is really hot?
Man i dont even watch jojo's but holy cow shaynes bit had me dying man Amanda too the charecter of damiens voice over agent had me rolling
What amount of times can someone watch the DIO Shayne segment before it gets weird? Asking for a friend 😭
I actually thought Dio Shayne was Courtney in the thumbnail.
“I’m autistic and also a bitch” me as hell.
i clicked because of the jojo reference, no other reason.
Months later and I still get jumpscared by Shez every time the camera pulls back
Dio Shayne is a joke for Damien and Damien alone lol😂
Wow they were all actually really good! Shayne and Racheal were the standouts for me though, Racheal fkn smashed it everything was funny! And Shayne’s was just absolute perfection I could rewatch that 1 million times. His anime character and poses were spot on, and I love that he even got his nails done. Damien’s roast back was so good as well! It was impressive how he could get refer back to them on the spot and make it work. The part about Kimmy’s pool parties made me a little upset though. Her roast was savage and it would have been really good except I felt like her jokes had a mean edge, it was an actual dig at him. From seeing her facial expressions when Damien was roasting her back, it really backed it up for me. I didn’t see two friends joking with each other there, it was like two people who pretended to like each other. She really didn’t like the coco melon reference. I always got a weird vibe from her.
this is my fav funeral video I keep coming back to it ahhah
Shayne should cosplay tengen uzui from demon slayer and all might from my hero academia!!!!
Spencer's roast was fantastic, probably my favourite in this episode
Omg the dio cosplay sent me. That was perfection. Only if Damian had blue and purple hair he could be star platinum. Lolllll
I love Rachel
the fact spencer hasnt got a funeral is CRIMINAL
amanda 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I forgot Shane is an actor and I was shook, that was so awesome 💜
Dio needs to be brought back more often
Oh my god, Amanda is giving me Jon Pinnete vibes and I’m LOVING IT!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damien sitting up and roasting everyone back is so Damien
i think about “it really was in the blink of both eyes really hard” every single day
KONO SHAYNE DA
Bro even got Dio's sharp fingernails
"damien, a squirrel eater?" is such a funny bit and i have no idea why
Spencer was on fucking point in this one
19:35 I didn’t know much I needed to see Shayne as Dio 😍
Shayne's performance was a glimpse into how Vegeta would roast Goku.  That was funny.  I liked Amanda's performance, too.
I still can't believe Damian ate a cute lil squirrel 😢
So they roasted him for.... being respectful to queer people? I'm confused
Matthew Scott acts like a skitt of someone pretending to be a disney actor who never stopped doing the disney humour bit.
Damien won't ascend to the heavens, he will condescend to the heavens
This was the funniest one! I couldn't stop laughing!!!
Being autistic isn't a personality...
My favorite roasts were Shayne as the anime character, Olivia as the Yelp reviewer, and Amanda as the voice actor coach. Everybody made me laugh, but these three made me laugh so hard! Keep up the great work, Smosh. You never fail to entertain me and make me laugh.
WATERGUN KELLY!!!
I think Damien would be tickled to know that his surname means 'rabbit' in my native tongue
Idk why but this one hurt. Like actually
something tells me damien might be a bit woke lmfaooo
shayne looks so damn good with those nailssssss; also  damn yall were BRUTAL, i loved it
The minority comment KILLLLED me, shayne’s bit was so good 😭
I'm screaming Dio Shayne is so on point!
Augustus is such a great character
“i worked my ass off to get him buried as the only white person in a japanese cemetary!”  amanda is so funny oh my god
Shane’s Dio impression was perfect! And he roasted his best bud in such clever ways.
🤣😭this is hilarious!
You might say Damien's voiceover agent is a real DVA.
Gotta love Rachel!!!
Shane did that FOR Damien.
😢😢😢
Shayne, I liked him at first. But with this….He can pull off any character if he really wants too. Favorite one of the cast now.
Honestly it would be funny to have shayne voice an alternate timeline version of duo for an episode of jojo
Dio shayne is easily my favorite character of his
The moment I saw the name "DIO Shayne". I stopped existing.
Open casket is wired
Okay, I liked Amanda before, but she absolutely KILLED that. Main cast material. This was my first funeral vid... I'm so sad I've been missing out on such good content! 😭
I'm so sad that courtney isn't in this video 😢
This video has me creasing
It’s me, I’m the 8th of the audience
I now see why Olivia was invited… what tf was that lol
Shayne as Dio was so good.
lol im autistic and damien is my favorite member of the cast
I've been goth since 5th grade and all the clothes jokes are killin me 😂
they should redo shaynes roast, since his was the first, he didnt really get any of the new fun stuff they added later
Shayne would definitely be a perfect cast for Dio in real life anime character
Convinced that they always laugh at olivia just to be nice
I aspire to be as good as Shayne at doing a bit that on point and perfect, memorized, with poses, the whole thing. Just perfect
16:25
Amanda as a man 🫣
“Damien is autistic in the same way Taco Bell is Mexican food” THAT’S WHAT COMBINED ADHD IS OMG
Shayne is my favorite character on Yugi oh
I will NEVER get over how hot that shirt abd the black sharp nails look on Shayne
DIO SHAYNEEE
DIO Shayne
Bro this was hilarious!!!! 3rd guy roasted!!! 😂
The laughter being edited in really makes me not enjoy it
Also what did Olivia/Augustus mean when they said “most mid-cat I have ever seen?” I don’t know what that is. 5:33
why does Shane actually pull of Dio so well... ☠️
NOT DIO SHANE 😂😂😂
I was waiting for shayne to say "You thought I was shane, but it's me DIO"
I HAVE THE SAME SHOES AS DAMIEN!!!
Would someone be willing to explain a couple of references for me?  At 17:00, why does what Shayne says seem so shocking to Damien?  At 20:31, what does Tommy mean? What’s “stim”?
Tommy's laugh is right up there with Shayne and Kimmy's ‼️‼️ it's so funny just hearing him so loudly throughout the whole video 😭😭
I loved Shayne’s whole thing. My cheeks hurt so much by the end of it.
Shaynes bit was some of the most work put into a Smosh bit I’ve ever seen
Amanda looked like Ted Moseby from HIMYM
This is the best funeral roast
This just doesn’t compare to what Smosh actually IS!!! So glad Ian and Anthony are back. This right here, what I just watched. Just isn’t Smosh. Not even remotely close. God bless Ian and Anthony.
SQUISHY SQUISHY SQUISHY SQUISHY
“He fired all of his white blood cells for not being diverse enough!” I fucking died
The squirrel one was so unhinged, big fan
Dio Shayne was so fine ngl
these guys erupting in laughter after the general room temperature becomes 0.1fh hotter
I have seen Amandas part so many times, she's absolutely hilarious! 😂❤
that dio impression was flawless lmfao
the dio shane is awesomely funny
Spencer was NOt holding back
nah spencer and rachel CARRIED
Dio Shayne got me..... Uhhh
Was abt to click off but then Matthew Scott came out
I love that every time they cut to the cast members, poor Shayne is shaking from laughter but has to stay committed to being mysterious and hunched over for the sake of his incredible Dio reveal
Best cosplay in The World.
okay Shayne's was perfection, like i've watched that bit 3 times now. but Spencer was SO GOOD. every single line was comedy GOLD.
this is probably the best smosh funeral till this day
Okay, Shayne appearing as Dio and making the white blood cell joke was absolutely everything
I guess I'm the 8th 😂❤
Rachel the kind off person to make a funeral about themselves
I love how shayne dressed up as dio Brando and did his poses but I would have loved to see him get super low with the last pose
idk about yall but shane in a crop to and nail polish doing these outrageous poses is doing something to me. no idea what but its doing something
It would of been funny if shayne said your were expecting shayne but it was me dio
this whole thing was a motherhecking massacre
We need more Shayne Dio. I have never even seen Jojo but Shayne Dio is the best
he  just like me for real
I swear Spencer kills it every time, I was dying and crying
Is Damien’s girlfriend no longer on Smosh? I was hoping she would show up as his internet Waifu character
How come there’s more testosterone in the ladies than in the dudes?
Why does Amanda kinda look like jimmy Fallon 😂
DIO DA
FINALLY!!! MY COATTAILS CAN FLY FREE!!! Best line ever!
I’m here for the 8th time to watch Dio. That hit so perfect
i think this is the best funeral episode EVER
As someone who only started watching them for a few days... The jokes kinda a hit or miss... But I'd understand how the community who've been a long time fans would love this theme of videos.
I just need more of Dio Shayne
Someone else definitely wrote Olivia's speech
Damn, I thought this is the funniest Funeral BEFORE Shayne came up :DDD
I wasn't ready to personally be roasted by rachel, this hurts
Shayne was really hamming it up
He plays a good Dio
That is one jacked DIO
"it really was in the blink of 2 eyes really hard" made me laugh so hard lmaoo
This shit was so corny I’m so happy old smosh is back now
Squirrel meat is actually pretty good
"KONO SHAYNE DA!!!!" Dio Shayne is the greatest reference and character ever created fusing a homosexual psychopathic gay vampire with Dio is brilliant, i love it "GOODBYE DAMIEN!!!"
The guy with the sax didn’t get a turn
15:40 I looked on the IMDb page for the fire emblem game and well the agent ain’t wrong
I thought Shayn was dressed as Courtney at first
Can someone pls explain the women in stem joke pls. I’m not “innocent” just dumb
I think Dio Shayne is my bisexual awakening.
Damien came back from the dead and chose VIOLENCE.   But then he started apologising cos he's really not that kinda guy, and he's only EVER been in two physical fights, I SWEAR.😤
Watching Shayne's eulogy, I SWEAR DAMIEN'S GONNA CRY
Amanda really does need several Emmys for her awards-winning series'
"water gun kelly" Damn that was good
Camels in Siberian desert? 🐪🚫
if only dio had his lipstick :/
yo we need more DIO Shayne
The squirrel bit was pure Georgia Milller
Why is Dio Shayne kinda…
30:55 Ah yes, "fuck!" that's a new noise that Damien made up.
After Shaynes skit, Damien: About an eight of our audiance will love that. No Damien, maybe an eight will know that ref. but thats about it.
This has to be the funniest one for me, every roast was amazing
Omg is this where I’m autistic and also a bitch came from 😮
Damien seems like the kind of guy who only owns cats because, the females he’s attracted to love em
Shayne is giving me  Sonya Blde From Mortal Kombat.
I think Rachel is the only person in the channel I don't like, especially after her Reddit story.
That WBC joke killed me
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THE DIO BIT OMG SHANE HOW???? He changed his face exactly like Dio OMFG
Shayne is a legend
Shane and Amanda nailed this one. 😂😂
one of those things is useful at our job...
13:27 “I’m talking blue, I’m talking purple, I’m talking plue, I’m talking blurple.”  I’m DISHEVELED 😭
Everything is a jojo reference
HAHAHA ITS ME DIO
i didnt know shayne as dio was something that i NEEDED to see
I full on thought Shayne was Sonia Blade until it showed he was Dio 😭😭
Shane’s characters are top tier 🥇it was perfect 🤣
i loved what Shayne did
0:48 she just like me fr
"squishy squishy squishy squishy" was so disrespectful im crying bruh 😭😭
Dio Shayne was PERFECT
I can't get over watching this video ... all of the Jokes were good,,BUT Shayne Slay it in his DIO's costume. 😂
HOLY SHIT I LOVE RACHEL
Matt scott?? What even was that??
Amanda can rock the facial hair though.
shayes has brought us Christ, the matrix, a bootleg wizard from zelda , and now dio 😂😂
DIO
I didn't know Damien had tics like I do! Musta blinked past 'em or something.
Damien is right. I loved that Dio skit. 😂
OMG .. Amanda kinda looks like Zachery Levi for some reason....
Damien's part was the most fun to me , you can feel he got them hard with the inside jokes !
I thought the shez thing was them making fun of his hair, didnt realize he was actually the voice of shez
Shayne's Dio is spot on🤣
The thing I'm most impressed about is how Amanda managed to button the shirt inside out.
All I saw was dio and now I’m here
ok but WHY does amanda look eerily like the bistro hubby guy on tiktok???? it is freaking me out /pos
If Damien wasn’t dead before Shayne got up, he definitely was after he was done.
WATER GUN KELLY 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
spencer was HILARIOUS
I only just learned that he voiced Shez. I can’t believe it took that long
When Dio shows up in a smosh vid😂
DAMIEN IS SOOO FREAKING CUTE😆💕💕💕 LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH literally couldn't stop laughing. Keep on being amazing and thank you guys for making my days better 💕💕💕
spencer did not come to play around LMAO
Shayne went there. Lmao the commitment.
Dio Shayne is SO HOT WHAT THE HECK
peak shayne
Bro Shayne is DIO!!! dafeq why is this not a thing?
I think to anyone who isn’t already familiar with Smosh, Matthew Scott Montgomery’s but was fucking hilarious
Y’all like this???? Cringe and clowns🤡everyone of yall😂
this is the funniest funeral roast I've seen. Hits on hits on hits
Im part of that 1/8th audience 😅 Shayne as DIO freaking killed with the poses 😂😂😂
this was the best front to back funeral i have seen hahaha
i see.... so smosh has turned out to be nothing more than a jojo reference
Olivia fucking killed it
Dio Shahyne was just too much! :D
Lmao Shayne did what i can only consider the best DIO impersonation ever he could VA
You thought it was Topp, but it was ME, DIO!
My god did I love this episode, but I have to criticize one thing Smosh Team. During the 35min I had over 16+ Ads, often in the middle of a joke/punchline. I dunno how much you can influence that, but it took me out of it a few times and actually grew pretty annoying at one point.  Cheers though, love the content
anime shayne is beautiful.
Shayne with those nails are actually amazing
Amanda 🙏🙏🙏 we are not worthy
You were expecting shayne but it was me, DIO!
i frequently come back to this video just to watch amanda’s bit— the way she actually sounds like an exasperated manager is so good
Duuuuuuuuude, the dio part! My god! That is the best!!
“It really was in the blink of both eyes really hard.”
that spencer, agent, dio shayne run was absolutely phenomenal
Oh my freaking god 😂 this roast was beautiful. Seriously, every bit was fire 🌈 and also, Damien you’re wonderful!
Shayne unironically did a fantastic job as Dio and had an amazing costume. Hes so short though XD
I have a feeling, a tiny part of Damien was a little turned on by Dio Shayne.
Holy shit, Shayne was fucking awesome on this, I want to see more of this so bad! Anime Shayne was incredible
"I'm sorry if that came off abrupt, I'm autistic and also a bitch." Is a line I need to start using more
Spencer's roast made me accidentally choke on my water 💀💀💀
Amanda does a great job at creating characters, but Shayne and Rachel were definitely the best!
AMAZING DIO IMPRESSION!!! He did the gestures soooo perfectly!
Chance’s transformations are so good, the only way I can recognize him are those crazy eyes
kono shane da
The dio from shayne was on point.
Holy shirt Damien's clap back was the best I've seen and I've been binging these all morning
spencer and amanda had me dead
Tommy’s laugh need an award for sounding like a fire truck 😂  I’m not making fun of you Tommy i Promis ❤
Fuck.
shanye slayed
Petition Shayne to be Dio in Live action Jojos 😂😂😂
Daimen Ha(a)s died
i really wish the world could see these funeral roast videos because theyre so FUNNY SO GOOD
Damien Haas really became Damien Waas 😂
This episode was quite "MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA"
I didn’t think shayne was in the crowd then I Hurd the laugh
Me watching this playing KH: DDD: 🤩
is it me or does Amanda look almost like Jimmy Fallon?
amanda nails it everytime lmaooo
As a Taco Bell employee that joke was on point
WAS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
rachel was hilarious
as an autistic person, i LOVED those autism jokes! thats how you make jokes about autism
0:44 me<3
Shayne killed it with the Dio act. It was honestly gold.
I only recently got back into this channel, what is the squirrel thing about?
The return of shayne as an anime brother is killing me
I just like how shez is just there just cuz he voiced him
omg I had no idea the tiktok “I’m autistic and also a bitch” sound came from this😭😭
dio shayne is perhaps the best thing ever
Rachel 🤝 Rachel (me)           Autistic
dio shayne was CRAZY
I don't think it's cool to tell someone they're not autistic. You can't know that about someone else.
0:45 I’m Autistic too😊
Why has no one said that Amanda is jimmy fallon as that character
Amanda looks like if Jimmy Fallon went on a bender
I know the main joke is Damien is "woke" but my god i would feel so safe in a room with that man
I have rewatched this at least 20 times!
Genuinely wasn't aware how successful Damien's voice acting career has been and I thought Amanda's whole bit was just sarcasm.
Nobody talking about the fUCKING BOMB THREAT JOKE IT HAD ME CRYING
They really missed the opportunity to name the video “Damien Haas Died” what a waste
Dio Shayne is too powerful and strangely sexy 😂
WAS THAT A JOJO'S REFERENCE?!
W dio brando Moment
Shayne should dress like that all the time tbh
WHAT!!! LEGS FOR DAYS GUY!!! HE WAS MY FAV SKIT!!!
is this a jojos reference?
Amanda and Shayne 1 upped themselves
He Damien haas, and now Damien Hassn't
Damien and Shayne are the best best friends
I’ve watched this a few times now, and the jokes that still make me laugh are “Finally! My coattails can fly free!” and “Yep, that’s Japanese.”
Rachel was the best one hands down Although Shane's white blood cell joke had me weak... just like Damien's immune system! 🤣
Shayne did not say "Ze waldo" 1/10 Dio impression lol
damien is so attracted to dio its fucking hilarious aksjaksjzj
Shane deserves more respect for this performance 😂
Imagine getting roasted by dio at your funeral
Shayne’s dio cosplay is great and I feel like that’s underrated
HA!!!!!
20:12 FINALLY someone fucking said it!!!!!
They have been here on Smosh for so long, I'm glad that it's the time for them to go. We will give the replacement a really warm welcome. Good bye, Rachel's Personal Brand ☠️
20:24 oh baby oh ya got me laughing me ass off
I want Shayne's nails!
my brain thought Damian was Tyler, who is or was part of Markiplier’s group for a bit.
i didn't expect shayne hahahahahhahahah  i'm fucking dying
"i got lyme disease from all my tics" absolutely killed me as someone with tourettes
Watergun Kelly is the hardest any Smosh member ever went
Amanda’s funeral characters are amazing!!😂
Yoooo! Why did shayne have to go so hard with that Dio impression? I was fucking rolling
Major props to Matthew Scott!! His whole story bit was so funny! 😂😂
OMGGGGG I REALLY DIDNT WANT SHAYNE’S BIT TOO STOP
ok first thing: thats a sick ass outfit shane. give me that. second thing:  i have never been more rosted in my life, are you sure this was not a roast towards me vailed as a roast towards damien.
Spencer always brings the laughs
Amanda is magnificent
Gorgeous haha. Love Damien so much. 💖
I always noticed Damien’s hard blinks and honestly ever since i’ve been a fan. Something about the way he blinks is just so darn adorable.
Was shaynes a jojo reference
IM the eighth of the audience
You can tell Damien really cares because, dispite him not liking it when its loud, hes still friends with Shayne
Spencer’s roast did not get nearly enough love. He was vicious
Spencer is truly one of the funniest people I have ever seen. His jokes are literal wordplay and the delivery is fucking stellar. Love seeing more of him on the channel these days!
Was Amanda doing an emo Phillips impersonation?
Not me just finding out that Damien voiced Shez 🗿 I knew his voice sounded familiar!!
Dude shayne as dio is amazing 👏
as a jojo enjoyer, dio shayne is pretty epic
Spencer really went for the kill. So I'm really excited to see a funeral roast with him, because Ian and him has  a bit where he was the usually the "black sheep son" or the unpaid- starved editor under the basement. Ian  would literally bury him
WAS THAT A JOJOS REFRENCE
I love Rachel with my entirety she’s just like me fr
This one was PERSONAL 💀 They roasted him to a crisp
Never watched jojo and I’m gay but OML Shayne looked hot ngl 😭🤡 that was hilarious. These jokes were BRUTAL
DIO!?!? GIRL, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN HERE!?!?
i love how rachel was like “damien is not autistic” and then augustus just starts listing off autistic traits
This actually made me check out JoJo's Bizarre Adventure for the first time.
Not the twitch emotes on Corporate Discord
This is the most brutal funeral roast of them all. My God.
I think this one is my favorite roast so far 😂
i LOVE amanda's reactions! holy shit her reaction to tommy's "blink of both eyes really hard" had me screaming... though the joke itself already had me crying! xD
Shayne was chefs kiss
SHAYNE IS SO FUCKING HOT!!!! <3 <3 <3
This is the best roast. It wasn't overly mean like Garrett's, the Grave Roast slaughtered right back, and LOOK at the views. I mean I know it's been 4 months but I'm glad to see it's in the millions now.
Petition Shayne to only wear belly cropped clothes
I come back for Dio Shayne once a week. A master class parody performance of a parody basically.
OMG DIO Shayne 😂  I love anime so seeing this was hilarious 😂
Rachel’s “I’m autistic and also a bitch” being a viral internet sound and me getting the reference immediately is glorious. (Esp as someone who is autistic and also a bitch)
To go from Dio Shayne's "goooooooooooooodbyyeeeeeee Daaaaamiennnnn" straight into Tommy's "blink of both eyes really hard" is just unfair. 🤣
If your friends' jokes about you are mostly that you were too nice, respectful and considerate, I think you've done pretty well.
bro how are people gatekeeping autism 😭
20:05 u were right man i enjoyed every second of it-BEAUTIFUL
Say what you want about Olivia...
this was literally iconic every bit was on point
The crowd roasts are the best parts of this
"I'm autistic and he's... on autism tiktok" RACHELLLLL
Ong Shane😭🤣🤣
the women in stim got me lmao
Man having just started watching jojo’s dio Brando is so hatable.
dude i wasnt ready for shayne DJSAJDAJASDAHSAHSDHASDHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
*Damien! As a person on the spectrum with tics, I didn't miss the Lyme disease joke 😉*
*When will Keith get a funeral roast?*
how many hrs did Shayne put in at the gym for this joke?
omg i found the tiktok sound love it
Damien died so suddenly it really was in a blink of both eyes really hard
This was the best funeral by far
damien always gave me the tism vibes and this just cinfirmed it
dude shayne is just the goat
I really like Damien
Everyone is so good in this one. I'm trying to decide who was giving more and it's a toss up between Amanda and Shayne. And Olivia is the queen of hijacking.
Courtney did such a good job playing dio Damien ❤
Okay but seriously... Shayne looks amazing.
i love shayne scream laughing at everything
where the hell is that donkey i keep hearing? lol
Goodbye madesto
Damien haas died
I don't think anyone has been roasted so hard, but this freaking slayed. Hope Damien's psyche made it out in one piece.
we need more cosplays at funerals
My little 4 person family have ASD and we found it hilarious 😂 xx
Amanda's bit doesn't get nearly enough love, that was great. Was giving hardcore Laurie Metcalf energy (which is a huge compliment)
I didn't get the part about needing more women in stem or stim.
Amanda is more talented and hilarious than 75% of the current cast of SNL. Her character work is second to none
I came here for Shayne, I stayed for Rachel.
Umm I didn’t laugh once which is crazy
Is-Is That American President?!
Damien explaining himself at the end feels so Damien
Racheal smiling with her thumb up saying “I’m autistic” killed me 😂😂
Everyone went hard nice job peeps
How is no one talking about Spencer’s eulogy 😂😂😂😂 it was so understated and yet filled with every zinger
The fact that this video isn’t titled “Damien haas died” is an absolute shame.
Why is Shez up there in that frame 💀
There was an ad for last fortress and it was a gay couple this time. That ad seconded Jennifer Coolidge’s quote “they’re survivors. Gays just know how to do stuff” and now I’m happy lol
“Watergun Kelly” is a top-tier roast.
I haven’t clicked on OR laughed at a smosh video in forever and Shane made it happen
16:22 be prepared
Damn shayne is ripped
Im that 1/8 thay loved that
Shaynes had to be the best one 😂
Shane’s dio laugh is also a good all might laugh
I want so much more of Rachel!!! She's funny af 🤣😂🤣😂
They should’ve brought Brock Baker back for this. Goofy would’ve roasted Damian and stole his money.
I don't understand the STEM joke
Was Damien’s voiceover agent Johnathan Silverman?
20:02 Holy shit, I never would've thought to see Shayne as Dio, but my God, it was amazing 😂😂
Oh my God the virtue signaling comment had me absolutely wheezing
Speaking as a trans woman... Not a huge fan of all these jokes at the expense of being a decent person.
you thought it was just shayne under a dark hood, BUT IT WAS ME, DIO
HOLY SHIT, THIS WAS BY FAR THE MOST RUTHLESS ROAST OF ALL
Not Sebastian Stan stung by bees?! Heart broken!
Shanye was great dude posed and owned that roast
KONO DIO DA
Give Amanda an oscar already, she's so fucking talented
These all were amazing, but Amanda CRUSHED this
It took breaking glass to make Damien come back to life😂
WATER GUN KELLY 💀💀
god, spencer is the goat. not a single roast in any video goes unnoticed
damien is one of my favorite cast members and i love the energy in this roast. you can tell everyone clearly loves him and that he loved it
NOT THE SHEZ FRAME IN THE RIGHT CORNER LMAO
The white blood cell joke had me dieded
I can't begin to explain how much I love this persona for Shayne (and I don't even know the reference)! This has surpassed the Chosen for me. Everything is just impeccable. From the roasts to the outfit to the voice to the movements. Just pure perfection 🙃
SHain !
Olivia is so cringe and unfunny.
Dhsjshshshsj I’m so behind on smosh videos, the picture of Shez in front of the podium is knocking me tf out 😭😭😭😭
Shane.. I take offense of you mocking me!
GOODBYE DAMIEN
His voice over agent looks like Andrew Garfield
0:17 7:49 11:00 16:20 24:15 27:44 30:10 35:05
YOU WERE EXPECTING EITHER SHAYNE OR AN ORIGINAL JOKE!       BUT IT WAS ME, DIO!
calling amanda "olivia with all the sliders turned to maximum" is a highly unique read and i can't unsee it
Shayne is an awesome anime villain
This has to be one of the best funeral roasts, if not the best
6:21 Just save my spot
Spencer was soo savage, honestly he's becoming a legend.
Shayne Dio is my new favorite character 🤣🤣🤣
16:28 28:00 God's last name isn't Damnit. Praised be the Name of the Lord!
Damien wouldn’t like me lol
This got me into jojo
That's the funniest Jimmy Fallon has ever been.
The fact that I didn’t even notice Shayne was sitting there until he stood up 😭
If someone doesn't bring this energy to my funeral, I don't want it
Rachel, Olivia, and Spencer came out HOT on this one. They lit Damien up
After watching this I really want to see Amanda parody Nicholas Cage
Tôi rất thích thương hiệu này
Spencers reflection in the picture 💀
I knew Rachel and shayne could do a reading but DAMN Spencer’s was underrated he read every part of him lmaooo 😭😭 had no mercy his bit was def up there 👏
No fcking way he got fire emblem?!?!?
I thought Olivia was brutal AF but then Shayne came out with the best bit in the whole series
Olivia ALWAYS shines at these 😂😂👏
I know SNL isn't really the big show it used to be, but it's still a staple of many people's senses of comedy. That being said, Amanda needs to be seen by the whole world and should absolutely be on it.
Amanda is S-tier comedian.
Damn, Tommy lost his touch in this one.😕
As soon as I heard Spencer say Martin Luther King Jr I knew something was about to happen
"It's just like my funeral except you remembered" I felt that🤣🤣
SPENCER NEEDS TO SHUT UPPPPP
rachel autistic SLAYER. we love you
No one explained to Rachel that having hobbies isn't the same as having a personality?
DioShayne killed me
I think the reason Rachel's is so unfunny isn't that it's offensive, it's that she made it all about her, instead of about Damien/the rest of the cast.
Shayne has had some good bits over the years, but gd if imitating Dio for a roast at Damien's funeral isn't the best of them all.
Shayne would fit so well as Dio in a JoJo's live-action
amazing
Man Smosh became a shitshow I don't even understand the format of their clips anymore I guess it's farewell for the humorous videos and creative sketch ideas and it's all about a couch group shitshow
Amanda is amazing at creating characters. I remember her irishmen in betrayal and now this....she is a genius sometimes. As always Shayne and Tommie were beasts and a treat to see. Still the best roast comeback ive seen to this day was Kimmy's she anihilated everyone that day.
Fuck. Let me know when there's a legit episode.
This is like my fourth viewing of this video and I just got a Twitch joke
I think Damien is a criminally underrated personality on smosh
Smash make a jojo video please
Shayne as Dio 🥴
The posing is fucking KILLING me 😂
"You were raised white and wealthy in Arizona and you've had steady acting work since the age of 20" "What the fuck are the muscles for soft-hands? you've never had to fight for anything a day in your life" Came SO out of left field for Damien why is nobody talking about this LMFAOO
Is that a mother fucking jojo reference
What is virtue signaling?   Edit: Also, does Spencer only have one ball??
Spencer was R E A D Y and armed HOLY SHIIIIIT
The soft hands comment at the end, well done. Shayne's was by far the best but everyone was great.
Spencer fucking went IN
Whats!? Hehe😆
0:19 lol Amanda already
I’d like to point out, that others have noticed but not really realized how impressive it is. But Shayne is jacked, dude has a high body fat percentage, but still had visible and pronounced abs, and visible striations in his delts. And more impressively, he doesn’t make working out his whole personality.
He didn't steal that first ladies gimmick of being the size of a SUV.
8:01 until 11:00 crazy good.
I’m planning on being buried with my one piece swords and manga collection
I hope my friends are as kind to me when I die😊
The squirrel joke was some how more dry and random than Seth Meyers... Congrats you out Seth Meyers, Seth Meyers 👏👏
wtf why is shane really good at those poses?
I love me some JoJo reference! <3
Can someone explain what Shayne is doing please?
Rachel is my absolute favorite, I remember her on snarled and she’s just as hilarious as ever
The fact that Shayne didn't break character is insane, he's such a talented actor and crazy lunatic at the same time
Also you should have definitely done shayne's bit last. It would have been the best cold close. Just for once.
We need a redo on shayne, it wasn't as brutal as the rest got it. We need the modern version for him.
Kono Dio ga?!
shane leaves = smosh dies
16:29 to 20:02 DIO Shayne
IT KEPT GETTING BETTER
Who is sax guy and why does he never speak but also doesnt play the sax?
I haven't seen a Smosh video in a hot minute. For this to be the 1st one back, I've very happy. Between the roast have been the best saga they have added in a while.
I keep coming back to this video. It's just so funny. This is the best funeral yet.
0:00
Damien is my favorite so I'm glad his funeral is fucking funny
That squirrel shit was lame AF, not even close to funny, just sad and lame
Amanda as Damien's agent was an acting masterclass
Spencer off the rails on this one lmaoo
Seriously why does amanda work for smosh.. she’s a freaking genius 😂 also yes. Shayne did that. 5 sthars. ⭐️😂
DIO Shane is almost as good as the chosen
damien is such a sweet guy so i rly didn’t know where they’d go with this one😭😭
What if you did a Courtney freaking Miller is dead? Or Anthony and have a empty coffin....or a Mathew Scott one?
just realized that the mic wasn't plugged in lol
Way more than an 1/8th Damien. Way more. Shayne deserves that merch.  Spencer's a excellent writer. Amanda has great character building.
a smosh video cracking 1m views is now such a rare occurance 🙁😔😭
I wanna see Spencer in that coffin
Shayne’s eyebrows during that whole part omggg
WHY DOES SHAYNE LOOK SO GOOD.
This was amazing. Exceedingly brutal
Just rewatched this. Just goes to show how our collectively love for this boy isn’t in vain. Everyone brought their AAA+++ game. Shane did EVERYTHING, Rachel SLAYED, tommy was at his Peak, Spencer did a Grammy worth set, Amanda showed everyone why she’s SNL (when SNL is good and makes their female comedians superstars) materiall, and even Olivia was funny.  Damien is the gem of this channel and it warms my heart that he is loved this much by everyone else.
"It really was in the blink of both eyes really hard" FJCJSJVKEKGKSKF
Amanda's bit, ffs 🤣💀
JOJO REFERENCE !!!!!!!!!!!!
I need to see more of Rachel omg, such a good start to this video!
Amanda is PERFECT~
Okay but Damien uploading his twitch channel’s emotes to Slack is a power move and I’m inspired.
Spencer needs his own Netflix special  And Shayne. Both of them  Ft. Damien
Amanda looks like Jimmy Fallon in the movie Taxi
Isnt it funny how on a Damian video Shayne is the most people talk about? I like the consistency
The FUNNIEST thing I've seen all year. Thank You guys.
Shane!!!!!! Loved it😂😂😂😂had me laughing so hard… waaaaaayyyyy to accurate
DIO Shayne is honestly a work of art 😭
Amanda is so damn funny, has been since she joined.
Tommy and Shayne have great humor. They are the stars.
Shayne's Dio bit was superb! Absolutely amazing.
Ngl...dio shayne...with an acrylic nail...damn.
goddddd i love olivia, her weirdness would perfectly mirror mines she is truly one of a kind in a world of clones never change olivia,never change ♥ ♥ ♥
....Tfw I like Damien Haas' bit the best at Damien Haas' funeral. And Dio Shayne. That's pretty fuckin' funny, c'mon.
This wasn't a roast, it was first degree murder. Absolutely brutal.
This was hilarious. Real shame Damien’s gonna have corporate force them into sensitivity training after this though.
love tommys loud ass laugh
Shayne actually did a really good DIO. 🤣🤣
Shayne's stand ability is subtle advertising
0:56 literally me
"It really was in the blink of both eyes really hard" was the single most perfect and violent intro to one of these speeches I think I have seen.
All my favorite people here  Keith:🥲
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
love this
The Dio bit had me in tears actually I’m fucking dead-
Shayne was walking a fine line with the delivery of "Do you understand?"
I didn't think it was possible to murder a dead person until I watched this. They took his core values and wiped their asses with them. Even the Apache tribe wouldn't be this savage.
Not titling the video Damien Hass Died is beyond a missed opportunity
I think this was the best TNTL, everyone went so hard from start to finish
I have to rewatch this, cuz it was flippin' great! XD
You expected Shane, but its me DIO
Someone edit in DIO's theme into Shayne's bit.
Taking psychic damage because I WATCHED THE CIRCLE EPISODE RACHEL WAS IN
jesus christ this was carnage.
it that a jojo reference?
Smosh always has this kind of college improv group type atmosphere, but Spencer consistently plays at the level of a full on comedian. He’s funny both with and without bits.
16:30
Amanda is giving pure Chris Farley. Good lord. I want her to say living in a van down by the river now.
this is the role shayne was made to play
That one picture of Shez in the corner alone was enough to make my stomach hurt from giggling, great job
Dio Shane means EVERYTHING TO ME
Olivia really just had fun with this
“olivia will get damiens twitch, but don’t worry theres meds for that” IM DYING LMFAOOO
This has been straight fire from everyone
I’m not even 10 min in and this is the most brutal, funniest video of this series. Holy crap.
Kinna wish Damien's "voice recording" was that TikTok voice.
ayo...why is troy deeney there?!?!?!?
I would die for Rachel????
Hes so adorable though. Like that's my type 😊
It's so funny to me to see Rachel's bit then see every other person come up and say he couldn't stand nois see and lights
Shayne is and will be the best of Smosh, it is both great that they have him and also sad nobody comes even close to his level
Shayne didn’t have to go that hard 😂😂 teenage me would have died over that performance 😂😂
Shayne was LIVING with nails
I don’t understand all the squirrel content?
Dio!
By far the funniest smosh video
So as someone who just started watching Jojo's...Dio Shayne is probably mor eDio than Dio lol
17:14 Wait that was Rubber Soul not DIO
DIO SHAYNE NEEDS A RESURFACE.
Dio shayne is just real life cortney XD
Tommy's laugh has me rolling😂😂😂
Like for Dio👍
Why does Amanda look almost identical to Ted from How I Met Your Mother?? 😂😂
16:40 HOLY FUCKIN SHIT!!! IT'S THAT A MOTHERFUKIN JOJO REFERENCE???!!! OOHHHH JOJO IS THE BEST FUCKIN ANIME JOSUKE IS SO BADASS!!!! ORAORAORAORAORAORA MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA WRYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I'm a Damien mega-stan
I love Rachel and Damien’s friendship so gd much.
Can we talk about how fucking amazing Shayne's Dio cosplay is? 10/10
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have rewatched just shaynes part at least 12 times already
How could I forget Damian hasn't died yet?!
Was anyone expecting to see Shayne dressed up as a woman? No…totally not. 😂😂😂😂
thank you Shane for reminding me why im bi
Solid job. Shayne as Dio had me rolling.
bro that DIO impression was way too accurate 😭😭😭
When Tommy said “Blink Too Hard” I died a little inside 😂
I love how MSM is like that one recurring character we only see every dozen episodes in a sitcom and I eat it up every time
Ian wasn't in this shoot so Olivia had to step up with the best bit 😭
THE VIRTUE SIGNALLING LINE 💀💀 KILLED HIM WHEN WE WAS ALREADY DEAD
Damien and Shayne are the best ones on the show with Garrett
This whole video also just kinda proves that Damien really does try to be the best him all the time, such a genuine dude
Shayne: "im suprised he made it this far. he fired all his white blood cells for not being diverse enough!" nah im ded XD
I wasn’t startled after this video
Shayne is giving Gundham Tanaka energy🤣
Spot on about Tommy being so underated. Where's the petition to make him a cast member??? It's got my signature!
Shayne’s bit was the best. He got all of the poses and the timing of Dio perfectly
Dio shayne is the best it’s so funny
I haven’t seen Smosh in a decade but this is what it is now? Some wannabe SNL. WHAT HAPPENED to the main guys or what
i get that amanda is suppose to be an agent but she just looks like sh*ne dawson
im still surprised that he didn't scream za warudo, or atleast say the world
24:19 needs more context, was he legit mad here?
Honestly, this might be the best episode of Funerals to date.
Jesus, the amount of skin you need to be roasted by smosh:<
the amount of love in that room for damian is amazing. like i know how close they all are and all the laughs just make me so happy😂💙
As another Rachel who's very clumsy and also autistic, I love her.
exactly. whats coco melon? i know chilling adventures of sabrina, castlevania, on my block you know the good shows
spencer was in rare form. didnt understand a lot of the references (shearing???? sherin? i dont get it) but he was HILARIOUS
just waiting for shane to give the best speech EVER
i’m sorry but tommy’s first joke made me curl up in a ball holy shit 🤣🫣
Amanda says oh no, but I don't think that's what she means 😍
This is the hottest Shayne has ever been
Dio!Shane is best Shane 💖
Shayne is making me more and more gay everyday
"What the f*** are the muscles for, Soft Hands? You've never had to work a day in your life" HAS ME IN STITCHES!
Shayne be moving like a damn Ace Attorney character
Damian Haas died... it was bound to happen, but who knew it was going to be so soon? Even Za Warudo couldn't stop this tragedy, but Shanye dressed up as Dio was my favorite, even though you saw coming the moment you saw this video
Spencer, Amanda, and Shayne CARRIED (with a well deserved nod to Olivia too!!) Honestly amazing, shouldn't have watched this in a quiet space lmao
Me. I'm one of the 8th.
This was great. But at 33:34, is Damien implying his friends can't post anything on social media that he didn't participate? That he has to be invited to every "pool party"?
JOJO
This is more brutal than most UFC fights
Damien may have not been dead when this started but he was when Rachel was done with him
Ok but why was Amanda dressed as Keith from the Try Guys at the end of his rope??? 11:31
That whale isnt even funny. Not a single thing that thing said made me laugh. Not even a chuckle
seeing shayne in dio cosplay was a BIG surprise. i’m part of the 1/8th that completely LOVEDD every reference!! ❤️❤️
Oh my fucking god, Dio Shayne MURDERED ME
This is the funniest Olivia has been
We have to give Amanda major props! Her character was so well built and executed FLAWLESSLY. Her acting skills are clearly phenomenal!
Shayne better be cast in the live action JoJo movie
I know shayne fuckin killed it, but amanda was close too
Spencer's funeral is gonna be dope
Shayne was in the zone when amanda was doing her bit. The dedication he put into his character was so damn good
Dio
Can y’all do one with Lisa????
Is Spencer missing a ball....?
Shayne be like: IT WAS I, DIO
Thank You Smosh and Damien for mentioning Kimmy❤️and her pool parties lol amazing Video and I can’t wait for Kimmy’s Next🥳💖✨
8:37 Hey all. Really awesome Daimein funeral roast. Really like it. I just want to know after watching it again the second time. Where is this video where he misgendered a video game NPC on stream cause I'd like to watch this video. I'm curious now...
"About an eighth of our audience is going to love that" Truest words ever said 😭
Can anyone explain the joke at 20:40? I don’t think he says STEM.
Is anyone like see pic of one guy look like dio?  (P.s he really being like dio from jojo bizarre adventure from friend funeral)
KONO DIO DA WRYYYYYY
I see dio I click
I should not have watched this. I'm recovering from surgery and laughing almost sent me back to the hospital!
Is anyone else questioning what exactly the sax guy's bit was that it was clearly cut out? Now i HAVE to know what he did and what happened there. He got up, clearly started heading to the podium, then it just cut to Damien waking up.
Koro dio da
Too lazy to watch it all can someone tell me where the Shayne as DIO part is? 🤣🤣🤣
I hope they do the funeral of Lisa or Garrett.
As someone who only remembers a few things from Shane and Damien’s time on so random, namely the anime brothers, Shane’s entire bit felt like nostalgic fan service. Kinda like Star Wars Episode IX, do with that comparison what you will
"Amanda can really pull off a cross dress-"  "Well yeah they're a A-Man-Duh"  "..." "G e t   o u t"
HAHHHAHA
Shayne is amazing, more of that character please!!!
Yess Shayne!!!! Omg this whole things was iconic.
I have such a crush on Amanda
Nice Jojo reference
16:29 Dio shayne
Shayne`s bit was top tier, but Tommy's first joke was so perfect : Damien died so suddenly, it really was in the blink of both eyes really hard. "Dead"
I just realized it says "My favorite coffin" on the side of the coffin. XD
missed opportunity to name the video as 'damien hass died"
The big reveal here is that Rachel needs more screen time.  She is hillarious!
My favorite Shane play, i just love Jojo.
“In a blink of both eyes really hard” got me to genuinely laugh out loud in public. Tommey doesnt hold back & notices everything I love dangerous roasters like that
Did anyone notice Spencer's reflection in the picture on the bottom right
Amanda (i think her name is) is quite literally one of the best actors on this show. She acts like she’s from SNL lol
Courtney be lookin like she hit the gym
Shane's anime poses are incredible.
If I ever joined Smosh, then who knows how well I would do.
Is he still dating her
I saw the artificial heartless emblem on Damien, and I thought I was gonna see a Damien Nobody.
The entire first time I watched this, I didn't realize that framed photo was of Shez, and had to double check the joke that Damien *actually did voice Shez in the English dub.* How is this the first time I'm realizing that??
Shayne's bit is what I'd imagine Damien's Bachelor party to be like lmao
Glad to see Ian in this video playing his role as Olivia
No way the frames shez fire emblem picture xD   I gotta finish 3 houses one of these days man. Edit:fuck i did NOT know he is shez!
Shayne die looks too fucking hot wtf
I've just binged through 4 of these these are so GOOD!
Shayne being Dio from JoJo was amazing lol xD
I gotta say, I think the reason Damien's therapist hasn't diagnosed him on the spectrum is because therapists absolutely cannot diagnose ASD. That's gotta be a Pyschiatrist or Doctor, and not just any Doctor, it would have to be someone experienced with ASD diagnosis and it is generally a very long process, even for those with stronger symptoms.   Self-diagnosis of ASD is impossible. Not unless you're a Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrician, and even then, that would be unprofessional.
i dont get the feeling most of the cast likes damien. he seems like a pain to work with.
They missed a chance to name the video “Damien Haas died”
Why did I never realize his Surname is Haas. In my language it means Bunny.
Dio came out of nowhere and he's being such a star, YOU THOUGH THAT THIS IS ONLY A SMOSH CHANNEL BUT IT WAS ALSO HE'S, DIO'S CHANNEL, HERE TO CLAIM DAMIEN'S BODY!!!!@!
Shayne was genious in this one. It was super fun and impressive at the same time
Damien currently figuring out that he’s possibly high-functioning autistic, literally at the same time that I’m figuring that out as well. I haven’t been properly diagnosed, but I’ve read the symptoms and it’s pretty obvious by now.
Spencer was by far the best. Lmao
The best one so far.
did they cut out the part of the guy with saxopkone??
WHY DOES HE SLAY THIS THOUGH💀
20:10 he was right
Omg watching shayne die under that cloak was everything
I thought that was going to be a young Al Pacino
Dio vs Josuke
Bruh nailed Dio's voice
im part of the 8th of the audience that loved that
This roasts, Damien comment about Rachel, and Who Memed it, really showed me how much of a soy boy Damien is. Get a back bone
Everybody hit their stride here!! 😂 more more savage join forward!
okay i’m sorry but why was dio shayne kinda
Why is literally everyones new character trait autism. 99% of the jokes were autism related. Such a funny joke
holy fuck shayne as dio awakened something in me, the crossover i never expected
The fact that Damien felt the need to say his twitch emotes "are cool" when Spencer mentioned he uploaded them to slack and uses them regularly kills me 🤣🤣
I don’t understand msm bit 😂😂
IN THE BLINK OF BOTH EYES VERY HARD
OMG, why isn’t Tommy Smosh’s official roast master?
Dio 16:32
I thought Damien Haas Been dead… 😂😂😂
Amanda's performance was an A++. Hilarious and so well done
Yo they went hard at Damien. I was legit feeling bad at some of these
Bro the jojo references were hilarious
damien was literally incapable of just laying there and pretending to be dead like everyone else does. i think his eyes were open more than they were closed lol
Dio fully took me out.  I've been drinking a coffee and when Dio showed up I fucking spit it all over my laptop. Was it worth the laugh? Yes. Is my laptop sticky now? Yes, also.
One of these times Patrick should just surprise everyone by going up as the sax guy and just absolutely killing it.
what if Mythical did a last meal, then smosh did the funeral roast the next day?
NO YOU GUYS DID THE UNDER THE MISTLETOE ON MY BIRTHDAY AND I MISSED IT im gonna go cry now
Idk if anyone else noticed and thought it too, but does Amanda also blik her eyes very hard on purpose? As if she played the role of Damien's voiceover agent, so she/he acquired one of Damien's main characteristics?  No one? Is it only me who saw it like that? Ok 🤣
It just kept building. This is the most roast ever.
why did Shayne look more like Courtney, then Courtney looks like Courtney
This one is funny
Probably my 7th time watching this roast. This is just such an amazing one! <3
Well fuck turns out people with OCD are all the same because all of this was way too fucking relatable
Dio Shayne is going to live rent free in my head for a very long time
not the way Shaynes poses were absolutely on point!  he also memorized the whole thing too! Perfect delivery, 10/10.
I loved bargain bin dio lmfao
Hims was such a heckin' good boy.
I wonder how much Xanax Damien had to take before this, either way possibly one of the best smosh services....behind Shayne's of course.
got dayum. spencer was going in though
I love how they keep getting more savage, also we need to make Shane an anime protagonist or antagonist please
Shane Fr just said “IT WAS I, DIO!!!”
Here I was waiting for Tommy to bring on some real top-tier roasting, but then Rachel come in and starts the show by slapping me in the face with the book of "Hold on to your ass and watch this shit"
I really like how Matthew's necklace perfectly fits the collar of his shirt.
I really want the next one to either be Jackie or Kimmy.
NOT SHAYNE ADS DIOO
if damien ever actually dies... the world is gonna drown in my projectile niagra falls style tears.
How can I get abs like Shayne!!! Just the abs, not the nails or wig or Dragonball Z pants.
the fact that patricks whole thing just got edited out is so funny
I love how this went from them mainly roasting the dead person to not only them roasting the other funeral attendees, BUT THE DEAD MAN STARTS ROASTING THEM BACK SO HARD😂😂😂😂😂
This entire thing was just a clever ploy by Shayne to be allowed to display his muscles for 10 minutes.
wow finally a smash not all about keith
Dio Shayne was not only drop-dead gorgeous, but homie had his roast DOWN PACT in his head. That gave him so much more flexibility to steal the show with his villain impression.  Everyone was awesome, but he was perfection. ✨
Spencer's the MVP of this one imo
Me: 😳 Shane: It was me, Shane! Me: 🫠💀
Damn Rachel dropped him like his name was Bam. That was kinda brutal overall.
Also not Damien possibly having a panic attack
Shayne in THAT fit is doing something to the bisexual part of my brain
From one neurospicy to another Rachel iflysm <3
Shayne looks so beautiful. Like wtf period Shania
22:52 Video ends here
CONO SHAYNE DA!!!!!
If there is ever a live action JoJo I think we have the antagonist.
Okay but why does Amanda look like Justin Long?
Shayne plays Dio so fucking well. I've been wheezing for 10 minutes
Shayne's performance actually made me think about watching JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
Dio reference! Dio reference! We have a JJBA STAN THERE!
I'm so excited for Keith's funeral roast
Shane is live action Dio confirmed
The roasts are hands down my favourite videos this year, and this one is chef's kiss.
2:13 bruh this girl whoever she is, is NOT autistic
Better than some drag queens on Rupaul
I like how its pretty universal that Dasani is shitty water
somehow tommy was the least brutal of the group............... how bout that ???? (also noticed how i said LEAST BRUTAL 👀 and not kindest............ i meant that)
Love Damien's style-not sure why they kept roasting that. But hilarious! Love Damien!!
As a long-term Jjba Fan, Shane did a phenomenal Dio impression. W for him hahahah! Wheres the Jojo fans at ✨??
Shayne as Dio Brando was a thing I never imagined, which made it all the sweeter when I realized how AMAZING he would be in that role!
I'm not familiar with the newer era of Smosh, but dudes performance and voice was on par with actual English DIO VA fr
i need more dio shane that was hilarious
“olivia with all the sliders turned to maximum” LMFAOOOOOOOAAAOOOAGDHJFGAHAKDJGES
This is my favorite Olivia bit.
Shane’s dialogue sent me on a TRIP. The poses and everything, flawless.
yall are getting really good at this...this one was funny as hell 😂
I cant stop rewatching this. ITS SO HILARIOUS!!!
Glad to be part of the 1/8th of the audience that loved the DIO part
I love that Damien came back from the dead momentarily to make sure none of his fans got offended at the funny.
This is easily my favorite of these so far🤣
Damien forgot he was dead
Watergun Kelley 💀
Saw Dio and Damien and I clicked so fast I think I could be legally considered the Flash.
I’ve watched the Dio Shayne 3 times and I’ve never even watched Jojo
Olivia as Augustus was discipline channeling chaos like an Archimedes death ray right at Damien
Holy crap! This is the funniest that Olivia has EVER been! Fantastic Job!!
Amanda's a future snl star
Who is Shayne supposed to be?
It was me. I was the 8th
It was me dio
Make Dio Shane a recurring character please
11:10 Mom can we have Saul Goodman? -No we have Saul Goodman at home The Saul Goodman at home:
"I'm autistic and also a bitch" now that's the kinda representation we need 😂
can someone explain please what's the humor in the "Who the hell is that guy" bit?
16:39 This is what I’d imagined Dio would look like.
Ive watched smosh for a few years now and never felt that I had a favorite, but this version of super shayne was fucking incredible and my favorite piece of material so far!!
That Dio laugh is unclockable.
15:45 the only white person in a Japanese cemetery 😂🙈
Everyone's talking about Shayne, but not enough people are talking about how hard Spencer killed this one.
Keep up the great work! I love the funeral series so much
wait a minute... is that a JOJO REFERENCE?? XD
"About an eighth of our audience is gonna love that" The eighth of the audience including me: GuYs He'S tAlKiNg AbOuT mE! 😲👉
I also love that Damien is wearing a kingdom hearts shirt on
I don’t know that I could look them in the eyes after they roasted me this hard.
damien hass died
Damn Spencer was ruthless
the fact that everybody was howling the entire time just really got me
losing my mind over how pretty dio shayne is
Ze worldo?
Good Lord Dio Shayne is a revelation
I love dio Shane with all my heart
These are always good but I think this one is the best. Everyone's character was amazing
Dio... dio... dio!!!!!!
The second i saw DIO Shayne I came here
Amanda has single handedly become one of (if not) the most consistently entertaining person on Smosh
I can't believe that Damien is the type of person to use the word "Latinx" unironically
Bruh shayne went HARDDDDDD 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Olivia went off, loved it so much
So many favorites😂 had to watch this over with my husband because he was wondering why I was laughing so much
Damn they came for him hard lol
Spence went IN on him 😭
Anyone know what happened to Paige?
I only get the Shane bit
“Damien is autistic in the same way that Taco Bell is Mexican Food” is absolute gold. The autistic community now claims this episode.
Spencer is SUCH a good writer and Amanda is amazing.
Damien not understanding the assignment and keeping his eyes open throughout the vid is so funny to me idk why😩😂
Is that jojo reference
That was my favorite thing I've seen Olivia do!
Rachel had me BAWLING she's so funny PLS have her back more
The Anime delivery from Shayne!! Fuck, must have been one of the best things he done🏄🏼‍♂️ hats off! Loved it YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I've never learned so much about someone, so fast.
This might be the worst thing on the internet..  if they weren't paid to laugh... Smosh is actually dead ..
Shayne wow
OMG DIO I screamed
Side note... why does Damien's agent look like the Wish version of Al Pacino
This is Amanda's best performance 👏
Oml, Doug looks like a completely different person. I need his fitness plan, lol.
At the end of Tommy's, I clapped too.
Spencer is fucking genius
I love when they roast in character. Shayne's and Olivia's performances made me so happy <3 And I couldn't even laugh at Amanda's because it was too good. I was just completely mesmerized with a sh**-faced grin the whole speech XD
Dio Shayne is something
I thought Olivia was gonna be ponytail Damien the way she was dressed 😂
Holy shit 😂, that was brutal, I like this Smosh
Ultra instinct shayne topp
Of all the funeral roasts so far, this one might be the funniest yet
Oh my God Shane killed it
Love Matthew Scott Montgomery, good to see him again.
Shayne was was amazing
They were waiting for this moment 🤣
Damien got violated way harder than anyone else! Took it like a champ.
You know what Shayne made a great dio I'm not gonna lie hilarious
Damit Damien it a funeral, shhhh, play dead, and wait your turn lol. one of the best videos I've seen in awhile
Nothing makes the virtue signalling jokes better than Damien telling people not to go after an autistic person who made autism jokes lmao.
Ok, this is absolutely the best one. Idk if he's just an easy target, but there were no flops, only bangers.
This one was brutal😂
This is my third time watching this, and I still die when Tommy says "it really was in the blink of both eyes really hard" 🤣🤣🤣
Can't believe Ian couldn't make it
This one seemed a little harsh. A lot was very funny; but damn... Damien is one of the most compassionate people.  Just to add some good back... Damien you are very appreciated!
KONO DIO DA
What his gf from Smosh Games?
Hey fellow 1/8th of fans 😁
Damien completely forgat, he supposed to be dead
Only watch this for dio
Every time I here Damien, I think they're talking about me, because our names are pronounced same. It's just my name has an O, instead of an E.
we get it rachel, you’re slightly autistic, but you don’t gotta make it your personality
As that 1/8 of the audience I did love that
THIS. IS. ART. everyone did so amazing
The subtitles mistitle my favorite line of the video - "Finally, my coattails can fly free!"
This roast was SO good!
Can anyone explain the joke at 20:40? I don’t think he says STEM.
Of course he would be buried in a kingdom hearts shirt.
Nah this was an actual funeral lol Each of them revived him and *murdered* him again and again with each turn ☠
Srry if that came out abrupt I’m autistic and also a bitch. I’m get that as a tattoo
Holy shit Shayne! Everyone was amazing but I can't even begin to describe how impressed I was with his impression. This made my year!
Rachel popped off. She got me every single time. 😂😂 slay 💅
While Shayne was good, he missed a golden "You were expecting Shayne? But It was me DIO all along" full the full effect
Shayne and Amanda were amazing. As always.
Most perfect dio cosplay
The energy in this vid 😂💜
My favorite line from the whole thing is “I know we’ve all been devastated since Damien froze to death in that boat fire.”
We need more dio shayne
I need more Dio Shayne
The "Tommy isn't in the main cast" joke is getting old... Stop it.
My god, DIO shayne.
i love being the 1/8th of the fans who got the joke :)
"IN THE BLINK OF BOTH EYES REAL HARD" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
That Dio Shayne monologue had me splits through and through
shayne as dio just looks like courtney
Even at his own funeral he got outshined by (DIO) Shayne 😔
That white blood cells joke took me OUT 🤣🤣🤣
I never knew I needed Shayne cosplaying as DIO so bad until right now.
If Shayne ends up doing more Dio stuff, that would be amazing!
Shayne did that too well🤣
Dio Shayne is so hot!!!
Is it just me or Shayne looks like Courtney whenever he wore makeup??? 🤔
Spencer is low key one of the funniest people at Smosh!
Damien Ha(a)s died
This killed, great job all!
holy shit this might be the best one yet. major props to damien for being able to laugh at all of that, and his revival bit was really good too! A+++
Yo thats another banger. Another banger By shayne topp from icarly
This might be the best roast so far
dio?
Where are Matt and Daniel?
Spencer is the best roaster ever. Like seriously the next Jeff Ross.
An eighth.. thats it..
This one was brutal 😂😂
spencer killed me 😭
I never watched this channel or smosh or whatever this is. But lets appreciate how toned and ripped Shane had to get to do this. That's dedication
OMG Shayne's Dio was so perfect, I got a cramp laughing at Damien's voice over agent and Dio
I haven’t watched Smosh in years and don’t know who any of these people are but Jesus fuckin Christ I laughed my ass off at this
Not sure but i think i detected a jojo reference
SPENCER !! 😂💀 PLS
If: you are stuck inside a walk-in freezer. When spontaneously a fire causes the boat that you're on to sink. Then: you could easily have frozen to death, During, a Boat Fire.
I feel like Amanda's bit was just her version of a Chris Farley impression 😂
I absolutely loved hearing all of this because my name is also Damien, he is definitely my favorite ♡
I didn’t even get Shane’s bit but it was still so damn funny. Shane never fails
This would have been a great opportunity for Saige's Kimiko from Damien's exes video
amanda is a fucking genius
spencer hit the nail on the head. i know they are friends, but damien for sure has a HUGE problem with virtue signaling and trying TOO hard to be overtly PC when its not needed. I truly think it stems from him having very low self esteem and wanting to latch on to performative activism to attempt to feel good about himself.
I hurt my hands clapping at Shayne again. Dammit Shayne!
WATERGUN KELLY?!?!?!?! noooo
dayam these are the best, how do we keep these going?
The jojo reference made me rise up my grave
rachel’s great! please put her in more vids 🙏
Ngl I thought Shane’s anime character was an evolution of Courtney Freakin’ Miller
Okay but how is Shane in that wig giving me Courtney in the best way?! 🤣Legit though this funeral roast was amaaaaazing, super job guys! xD
De los mejores funerales que an echo 😂
I could not work out if the vid was Courtney in a bad wig or shane in a bad wig... After this video, I'm still not sure...
these are always so good but god you all did not hold back on this one
This is the funniest regular content on YouTube, I love these and will be sad when they stop.
0:43 new record on how fast the dead break character
I feel overprotective over Damien but when he was roasting everyone at the end i felt like a proud papa 😂
Okay… for real though… is shaynes bit a Jojo reference?
All through MSM's bit, I kept thinking, "Viewer lacks critical information!"  Is there some context I totally missed, maybe because I never saw So Random?  Or was it just weird?
16:41 Listen, I don't know how to explain it, but this look is sooooo good for Shayne   The whole outfit suits him perfectly. Nothing more to add, he just genuinely looks amazing
living for spenser's funhouse reflection in the fire emblem portrait
You were expecting Shayne but it was I DIO!
Spencer giggling through his own jokes is everything
'You expected Shane- but it was me, Dio!'
Who knew Damien had to die for everyone to bring their A material.
Entire squirrel bit was weird and cringy and honestly just bad
Okay, _maybe_ I'm biased, but Shayne's bit killed me
Jackie Uweh roast 🎉
One of the best so far...
You thought it was Shayne...
Oh shit, Damien was Shez in Fire Emblem Warriors? Maybe I should go back and actually beat the game now.
Personally I for one welcome our new Rachel overlords
bruh "You were expecting Shayne, but it was ME......DIO!" Is just great. Loved it a lot.
17:33 I peaked here
I think the Tommy thing is why I can't force myself to like Chance. Tommy has been one of the funniest people on the platform for a long time.... so they announce they're giving a cast spot to some unknown dude?!? And keeping Tommy in the corner.... NOBODY PUTS TOMMY IN THE CORNER.... And I feel bead for kinda feeling like Chance put him there.
10/10 jokes. It hurt to laugh
Dio Shane slays, please make a re occurring bit lol
8 min in the video and poor Damien was easily roasted worse then anyone else. lmao
Dio Shayne was awesome, we need to see more of him, maybe in a try not to laugh video.
I first watched Rachel on dark 5 I'm excited to see her on here.
This was the weakest one by far
"I'm autistic and also a bitch" SAMESIES
Gotta say, besides the liberties taken thats one of the best DIO cosplay i seen, Shayne nailed his essense
I’m sad we didn’t get Shayne’s WWWWWWRRRRRRYYYYYYYY
This was well on its way to being the best one ever done until that squirrel story.  It was so unfunny and stupid that it completely killed the momentum of the video and brought the quality down tremendously.
" I'm sorry Damien, being in half as many videos as me DOES NOT MAKE YOUR A MINORITY!" Best quote, thanks Shayne 😂
Shayne's Dio was phenomenal. I almost missed some of the jokes while focusing on the incredible posing
I just realized Spencer looks like Cotton Mathers from the show Salem
Just gonna say y'all missed a golden opportunity for Damien Haas the dead
20:51 spencer's reflection in the bottom right is *sending* me
this one was brutal
Shayne always delivers top-notch acting. Might aswell call him Tripple A actor.
Kono favorite pizza place da!
Shayne’s part was the best 😂😂
As someone who is also the taco bell of autism, do some research into Sensory Processing Disorder. It cleared a lot of things up for me.
Best one yet
I need more Jojo Shayne in my life
Rachel is my favourite crew member, as a fellow autistic human I love her ❤
God please somebody do a dramatic edit with JoJo soundtrack and graphics 🤞🖖🤘👌💪🙏 *CommentComeTrue No Jutsu!* 👊
Shayne: Pretends to be Dio.  Damien: "about an 8th of our audience is gonna love that."   Me: gasp "They're talking about me."
The greatest JoJo skit on the face of planet!  I ain't even mad it's a godamm JoJo reference!
Holy spencer
It was me, DIO!
This was crazy, literally felt like the Michael Scot roast coz every line was HARSH
I love Damien buuut shaynies catching up 😂
🤣 did Courtney do Shayne's makeup I'm sooooooo getting Courtney vibe from him! This whole video was great!
Shanes part was the only Good part of this video
You guys, including the dead, did SUCH a great job on this one. Its so funny and amazing how yall perform and commit. All so talented.
15:13 spencer in the reflection of the picture frame made me laugh harder than it should
damn that DIO bit was INSANE
It always feels like Christmas when Spencer is in this series!
"About and eight of our audience is gonna love that" It's the reason I clicked the video
Damien is Shayne's heartless. Tommy is his nobody.
This was so hilariously brutal
Shane been hittin the weights hard. XD
Dio Shayne is my favorite character!!!
😂 Olivia: what’s Cocomelon?
fully knowing the mic isn't plugged in is both funny and infuriating
These videos are like a Festivus party, but everyone got stuck on the "Airing of Grievances."
We're gonna need WAY more of DIO Shayne
“Amanda is Olivia with all the sliders to max” I died.
Holy shit, Rachel didn't just start the roast, she built an entire bonfire and everyone else added nothing but pure gasoline. 🤣
As someone who doesn't really like Damien's whole virtue-signalling-30-year-old-man-who-paints-his-nails vibe, this was very good
I had no idea he voiced male Shez
By far the best funeral roast episode. No one held back
Damien Water Gun Kelly 🤣
Smosh is always there when you need a pick me up. They are always funny AF
you thought that i was shayne, BUT IT WAS ME, DIO
Shayne bringing Dio into this, yaass!!! 🤣😍
Is it weird that I found a picture of Shez from fire emblem to be the funniest part of this video
I HEAVILY enjoyed this one
imagine beeing sucha puss you get anxiety from thinkning youll offend everyone
i cant wait till everyone on the cast dies their hair color pink or purple and calls them self autistic or non binary. It must be hard to compete with other "funny people "
Okay but Shayne looks great in his costume
put a crown on rachel that was the best LOL
Is Shayne cosplaying as Dio kind of hot or is it just me? 😂
Shayne is a legend
Rachel fucking went in LMFAO
I'm three roasts in and I think this roast compares with Olivias or Noahs for the sheer brutality. Love it
…….fucking Amanda and Shane…..Jesus…..dude I pissed myself
4:00 is best place 2 start
Kudos for Shayne as DIO, I just died because they were so funny, Daimien was just a happiest boy i would imagine.
This WAS the best roast. I hope Damien's okay! ❤️ Lol
I knew Spencer was gonna go hard but damn.
Amanda absolutely crushed this, the funniest shit I’ve ever seen.
Matthew guy really killed the vibe it’s a roast you hit him harsh jokes not tell a long boring story
This has to be the best funeral roast they have done.
17:27 looks just like Courtney Miller!
DDIIiiiOooooooo!!!
rachel came in like a full on assassin, it was awesome
"Shayne will receive Damien's untransformed body, so Shayne can have his rib back" is an underrated zinger from Tommy that REEKS of religious trauma.
Amanda had livin in a van down by the river vibes
Dude, if Amanda was on SNL or something she'd be mega famous. I hope she stays for a while at Smosh tho. Everything she puts out is gold.
I love this
this was the first one of these that felt like was a no holding back roast lol best one yet imo
omg wait is rachel the buzzfeed satan person
The fucking Jojo shit was great
that was phenomenal, spencer and amanda had some real bangers there
KONO SHAYNE DA
Dio Shane is fucking incredible
I vote for Shayne to wear that outfit forever
Was it just me or did Shayne/dio have a major “Courtney” look
I think Rachel should be in more videos. She’s absolutely hilarious. As an autistic person, it’s really cool to have representation on one of my favourite YouTube channels. I don’t have any autistic friends so the only way that I get to see people like me is online. Of course make sure she’s okay with being in more videos. I’m just happy to see someone like me on Smosh.
Damien's voice-over agent looks exactly like Ben Forster
Okay but like shayne literally looked like Courtney
Can we talk about how BRUTAL Olivia’s roast was? Good goddamn
As the 1/8 I can verify I loved that.
OMG THE KIMMY COMMENT KILLED ME
THIS IS THE BEST EPISODE YET
How did they get DIO from JoJo Bizare adventure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amanda is male Shane. I LOVE THIS CHARACTER!!!!
ain't no way olivia called damiens cat "mid" 💀💀
Is it just me or Shayne Dio's make up looks really similar Courtney's?
I have never seen Shane look more like Courtney
Tommy killed me with his first line! Oh my God!
i- shayne just 🫠🥵 wow
Spencer's distorted reflection on the anime picture frame is killing me I can't pay attention to anything else
Not me and Rachel having the exact same tattoo in the exact same spot!
is it just me or does Shayne look more and more like a yoga dancer who's really into anime and takes his work to the max
Glad someone said it
Okay… I have no idea what the eating squirrel thing was. Like the cast members were laughing but I had no idea why it was funny
Dio Shayne is impressive. He must have a powerfull stand.
KONO DIO DAAA (in the clickbait btw)
This video really made me wanna give Damien a hug
Missed opportunity, “Damien Haas died”
“I’m sorry if that came off abrupt. I’m autistic and also a bitch”
Shane fucking killed it as DIO. But everyone else did an absolute great job! Best one yet!
I want more DIO shayne pls I was dying
I just wanted to tell you that Jesus loves you. He'll literally always be right next you. Even during the toughest of times. God will never turn away from you. He died for you, so that you can be saved. All you have to do is believe in Him and turn to Him.<333
Love how he cleared that spectrum jokes were okay so she wouldn't get backlash
Loved the DIO Shayne. It was beyond hilarious 😂
Amanda is Olivia with all the sliders turned to maximum 😂
Shayne character DIO is from an anime called “JoJo”, very good 👌
Omg the ad that popped up was for MAYO! LOL how perfect
Who else is waiting for DIO Shayne merch 🙊
Always look forward to the new funeral services
I clicked on the video for DIO Shayne
Okay but Shane pulls off at Dio cosplay very well
Didn't know I needed Shayndio in my life.
Anyone doing a jojo live action- you found your Dio.
In the future, their gonna have a real funeral
Dio Shayne is my favorite Shayne in the Shayneverse
Damien wearing a Heartless shirt for his funeral still manages to be only the second nerdiest thing in this video, and that's truly amazing
shayne dio is really good
Ian is very comedic tf who even ru
I'm not even halfway through this video and I'm thinking they may have to hold an actual funeral for Damien after this.
why was shayne dressed up as courtney? 😉😛
I love everything about this video. As I knew I would when it eventually came out 🥰
I love how Rachel says "one ball" like Spencer doesn't already fucking know. Lmao.
Damien didn’t even pretend to be dead 😂 he was just happy for the roast
Rachel with the autism representation ✨👌
Can't believe Damien haas died
WATER GUN KELLY LOL
Shayne's just been working out all this time for this exact occasion
"What the fuck are the muscles for soft hands?" Did NOT get enough appreciate that had me dyinggg
This is the hardest roast thus far, good lord. They massacred him
If I’m not roasted at my funeral like this I will be so so sad
THIS is how you make genuinely hilarious not disgusting jokes about neurodivergence, sexuality, social justice, and mental health!!! Absolutely crying from laughter this ia the funniest Funeral Roast yet. Amazing writing and performance by the entire cast.  Bring Rachel back for more roasting PLEAAAAAse
Instaclicked at the sight of Shayne Dio
Ngl Shayne's nailing being dio
Shane in Dio cosplay was so damn hot and everything he said was pure gold
nonononono, this was insane, INSANE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i love the entire Dio Shayne monologue
Damn they really went in on this one 😅
Amanda´s characters are all divorced. Mood
Amanda looks like Jimmy Fallon lol
"i'm sorry for being abrupt, i'm autistic and also a bitch" i've never felt so seen
Spencer and Tommy should be main cast, throwing it out there
Damien wrecked the whole crew lol
S ter roast
I wish he Said kono Dio da
Dio Shayne is best Shayne
Oh my god, Tommy’s “so Shayne can have his rib back” fucking SENT me
I think I was drooling I was laughing so hard at Shayne
I love the fact that Damien is super PC but fhe last time I heard that Olivia joke, it was Bo Burnham going, "say what you want about Asian people..."  The irony is absolute perfection. 👌🏼
Dio: poses. Tommy: Shut up.
omg Dio Shayne is soooooo goood!
I *need* Dio Shayne to make a return some day lmaoo
OMG!!! Lol!!! Damien is my boy. Shayne, Amanda, and Spencer had me crying. I luv you guys so much. I know i can always get a good laugh from yall.
I'm waiting for the day that guy gets a funeral. "I like to remember the good times. Like Olivia's funeral, Shayne's funeral, Tommy's funeral. ...I'm starting to see a pattern."
I saw DIO and clicked instantly
Was that a jo jo reference 🤔
DIO killed it
Kono dio da
Jesus Christ Tommy! 12:55 lol
Dio shayne made my voice go away from all the laughter
31:41 might be the best description of Olivia EVER
This is my favourite Shayne bit ever
Idk why but it’s infuriating to me that Damien hardly ever has his eyes closed and laying back like the other funerals. You’re breaking the immersion Damien! YOURE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!
16:29.... you're welcome
@19:45 merch popup shows right on queue😄
Dio shayne was godly
Between all the silly content and improv on this channel, one might forget that Shayne is a really good actor.
God y'all roasted the absolute dog mess out of him 😂😂😂 good on ya Damien, always a pleasure
Shayne's Dio impression absolutely sent me into orbit!! 🤣💀
I love how you can tell just how much Damian is loving all this. He looks like a kid in a toy store
Hello im part of the 1/8th and yes i loved that
i absolutely fucking ADORE Damien
I've never seen someone so perfectly encapsulate what DIO would be like IRL
I have GOT to see a Spencer roast with Shayne Tommy Damien and Ian
Shayne had me HOWLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shayne as dio... ya fantastic if a live action ever happened I'd watch shayne in it.
How light headed did Amanda get after that performance
I was sitting here like welp... nothing's going to top Shayne Dio. Then Tommy right out of the gate with "the blink of both eyes very hard" and now it's me who is dead.
7:16 - 7:36 I relate to all of this... 😅 Fun times
Damien can't pretend to be dead at all. Lmao
Oh my god this was my favorite one yet
Damien's jokes are wordy. Boom roasted I guess.
Amanda gave me some slight Chris Farley vibes. Also it feels weird going to a funeral without Keith stripping and twerking.
This was such a good video! I would love to see more content of people roasting each other back-and-forth, it was hilarious 😂
Shayne looks so good as Dio. Makeup, outfit, wig, everything
Best funeral ever.
Amanda needs and deserves an academy award.
Amanda kinda looks like Jimmy Fallon lol
Spencer's speech had me crying from laughter.
I saw so much (deserved) hype for Shayne's bit, but damn if Olivia and Rachel didn't kill me. Possibly best episode of the whole series.
Omg, amazing jokes.
Loved all of these, but boy howdy, Spencer went HARD. XD
Oh Amanda... She looked hilarious before she even opened her mouth.
Ah Christmas has come early!
Gosh I was waiting for this. I’m so glad a Jojo reference was made! 😂 Our BOY!!
Damien to Rachel is what it is to The Chosen to Spenser like
i really appreciate the subtitles
holy shit, spencer was LETHAL
That was one of the best smosh videos I've seen yet.
The way Matthew just randomly picks his voice up off the floor fucking kills me.
22:40 Non binary doesn’t exist
Rachel is my new favourite person ever 😭😭💀
Not me forgetting Damien is hella funny. 10/10
SHAYNE AS DIO IS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN OH MY GOD ??? i wanna know how long it took him to rehearse all those poses
I cannot get over this one. Everyone was so unbelievably on point. I might die from laughter by Amanda one day.
as an autistic ocd-haver w damien as my fav cast member (and the same blinking tic thingy!!! twinzies!!!), i absolutely lost it at like half these jokes, omg
not Dio Shayne!!!! lmfao i loved this so much omfg
I didn't know I needed Dio Shayne in my life until now 🤣🤣
That virtue signalling line was amazing
You know you messed up somewhere down the line, if RuneScape youtubers are getting more views in the first 24H.
Someone tell me why when Tommy was making fun of Amanda’s go to acting voice, he sounded like Kylo Ren?
Damn these roasts have been systematically have gotten more harsh 😂
YOOOOO Shaynes nails :O
What happened to his gf? Was it Paige? Or payge?
GOOOOOOOODBYE DAMIAN  the bisexual vampire said
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 for Shane
holy hell they were out for blood!
Man, Spencer was on fire.  Definitely the sharpest wit of the bunch.
Spencer: ... I guess, just like his true sexuality, we'll never know. Me: Don't.. Don't give me false hopes.
Spencer's outfit looks like he went to Yale and never stops talking about his wife but also cheats on his wife
Now we gotta add DIO in Shayne's collection of characters.
I know you all will probably do Jackie and Amanda at some point but idk ... Garrett's been looking a little sickly lately he might not have much time left ...
OCD squad rise up
Finally! Been waiting on the Damien roast!
Is no one gonna talk about the sax man? Was he just a red hering?
why did they all bring their A game for Damien's fneral ?
Just Spencer. Holy shit dude hahaha ya might have killed him
Water Gun Kelly is such a god tier line
Shayne as DIO was the only reason I watched this it was great
Not even going to lie, Shyne here is hot af
I wanna see the Funeral of “The Chosen” but he faked his death to see who was truly loyal to him and comes back to life and destroys everyone 🙌🏼
Best funeral
What is the woman in stem joke mean?
They are getting soooo much better. I almost wanna have them go back thru the cast again.
I love how hard they all went on Damien's roast, did not disappoint- I couldn't stop laughing!!! Everyone's bits were incredible and Damien's retorts were spot on. My favorite funeral right next to Tommy's!!
Olivia did effin' great in this one, loved it!
Amanda really channeled her inner Nick Cage for this and it was hilarious!! lol
I can't get over the portrait of Shez in the corner
About half of the fun of this vid is just hearing Tommy laugh
20:14 It's me, I'm the 8% of your audience 🤭
Amanda here reminds me of what Jackie said, she is so good .
Would love to see a Kallmekris one of these it would be so good
If Damien sitting like 👁👁 in the casket isn’t the most autistic thing I’ve seen- as someone who just got diagnosed in their 20s good luck with ur diagnoses broski
I'm about halfway through and my god this is BRUTAL, love it
Also Shayne is so funny In this 😂😂must be a privelege to work with him and smosh 😩😊😊
The video was so funny 😂 but Damn Shaynes abs😩
Olivia having subtitles whenever she talks.. Inside jokes.. 😆
idk bro shayne with the nails… did smth to me
For a moment I thought Amanda was Dunkaccino
Probably the funniest shit I've seen
Why does Shayne look like Courtney though
NAH SHANE AS DIO WAS ABSOLUTELY FIRE. OH MY GODDDD
I guess I'm the 8th lol
According to Augustus, Damien and I have the same menu lmaooo
I haven’t watched Smosh in years but I clicked on this for Dio  Edit: Okay that man’s Dio was insane!!! So funny wtf
I mean, Shayne's bit is great and all (definitely the most commitment to a bit), but the W of this roast OBVIOUSLY goes to both Amanda and Rachel. That shit had me in stitches.
Thank you so much for the subtitles XD
Holy hell this was hilarious. Brutal af. More please hahahaha
the Shez portrait is sending me
I kinda wish Damien would at least try to play dead. I'm a fan of his work, but he should have kept his eyes shut for this. Everybody else would break from the jokes, at their funerals, but they didn't continuously have their eyes open. He's great at everything but playing dead.
Why is this the funniest thing. Love you Damien. You're a champion.
DIO!!!
who clicked on this because of shanye's dio?
Shayne maybe have gotten the biggest laughs for his biting one-liners and anime poses, but Amanda absolutely killed her bit. Such an incredible character.
I thought amanda was Al Pacino💀
Spencer killed it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shane knows JoJos? 😳 WOW
Bro... Amanda being olivia with all sliders on maximum might be the funniest joke about amanda yet.
Olivia being subtitled was surprising advantageous to the bit
When shayne took of the cloak, i thought. What if he says "GoooooodByyyye Damien!!!" As a joke but it happen. I couldn't be more happier.
Holy shit these just get better and better.  Amanda, Smosh is lucky to have you, I'm SURPRISED you aren't on SNL regularly.  Yelp reviewer- you were a surprisingly  funny  person! Hope Smosh hires you.
Ok 1. GODDAMN RACHEL🔥🔥🔥 that shit was gold from beginning to end and such a strong intro. I haven’t laughed that hard in a while 2. 3:19 oh no, I know that face when you told a joke and you know it was funny but you’re also horrified that those words left ur mouth bc ur enough of a bitch that you thought of the joke but not enough of one to ever say anything offensive.
This was a real roast 💀💀💀😂😂
Wtf did smosh turn into not cool.
Shayne Had to have watched Jojo. That was just beautiful, Your movements were art.
It's kinda sad that Saige's Kimiko isn't on this roast, its would be hilarious.
8:58 Tha's how you know Spencer doesn't play online games. PC gamers' favorite pastime is hurling queer slurs in every competitive game they can.
this was the best funeral roast to date i was almost crying from laughing during shayne's bit lmaoo
These always crack me up 😂
gay
Good video!!!
Has to be one of the most, if not the most brutal one so far 😂😮‍💨 props to everyone fr, hilarious !
This was hilarious... until the squirrel eater bit, that went too long and just killed the mood for me. Olivia, Shayne, Amanda, Rachel, Spencer, Tommy and Damien brought their A-Game!
Damn, Shayne be fine as heck in this.
Amanda is a COMEDIENNE. Everyone was so funny omg
That was the best 👍 Shayne was amazing 💜 awesome roast love Damien, love Smosh .. keep it up 👍😁😂
I LITERALLY laughed myself sick to my stomach on Shayne's bit XDXDXD
Just a point of note, grey squirrels are edible and in Uk there was a campaign to eat them as they are killing our native red species
The *peak* of these videos has always been Tommi for me, but everyone served so much fire this time that I couldn't possibly choose a favorite!
I thought Olivia and Demian barely talked. So why she absolutely slaying this roast!?! So goood
Not going to lie, i saw shayne as dio and was like "yes, i will fail finals. i need to see this i don't care"
Amanda would have killed it during the MadTV years
Shayne is just the best I love him
Honestly old smosh was better
I would like an anime series based around Shane's character please thank you
I NEED MORE DIO SHAYNE IMMEDIATELY!! Funniest thing I’ve seen in a while. So good. Perfectly executed!
omg shayne's part was so great!
I’ve been one of Rachel’s 40 followers since snarled❤ I did a drawing one her and sapphire and Meagan and talked to them years ago on a livestream. Amazing people and I’m so happy to see Rachel still doing her thing
shayne's bit.... Omfg i couldn't stop laughing it was amazing.
GOD shayne looked so good!!!!
Amanda is a goddamn legend.
Dude the roasts on this one were top tier 👌👌
That white blood cells joke was about damien getting covid twice that too in short span of time between both instances OMG😭😭😂
"I'm autistic and a bitch." SAME OMFG
The firing White Blood Cells joke is so good lol
Dio Shayne made this hella amusing!  Like, everyone made me chuckle and laugh, then Shayne came in, in a Brando-way. lol like krish in earlier comments said, can we get that clipped copy of Dio Shayne moments in this?
PLS I WAS WATCHING THESE WHILE MAKING A SCIENCE PROJECT IN CANVA THEN SUDDENLY SPENCER SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT CANVA 😭😭😭😭
Shayne as Dio is giving me LIFE
Another Banger by Shaynee from ICarly
17:04 I think we just saw Damien actually die
This one was savage
WHO WROTE OLIVIA’S BIT
I want to see more dio shayne
I want to see more dio shayne
This is the best one in the funeral series by far
The conservative speedrun any percent had me SCREAMING
Shane is giving me major gender envy in this video and I just can’t deal
Shanye was born to play Dio Parody lol
Bro I need one of those signs to tell me when I should laugh
Amanda looked like Shane Dawson doing an impression of Tom Cruise lmao
Damien's Voiceover Agent = Jimmy Fallon  and I can't unsee it
was that a jojo reference
Genuinely one of the best , if not *the* best, of this series so far! Everyone really brought their A game
THE SIBERIAN DESERT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tommy is having a fucking blast man
I liked just cuz I saw Dio
The dio/shayne roast, my word!!!
where’s anthony?
Amanda and Shayne really did it for me this video. Amazing commitment to their characters.
The movements of Shayne are too good
Damn the roast were evil this episode
Damien is my absolute favorite so I knew this was going to be great, but it was even better. Love him.
This is one of the funniest roasts of all time
Shayne be looking like Courtney Baka Miller 💀
Shaynes bit made me vomit
I know Shayne is a star but Olivia as Augustus is just perfect.
Yes, I came here solely for Dio Shayne, just like everyone else lol
Sad to see where the channel has went to. Nothing will ever beat the old days of smosh
Kinda funny how the "deceased" in the first few funeral roasts were trying not to corpse (pun intended), and now they basically undie to re-die of laughter 💀
amanda killed as always. this roast is up there with her FBI agent character. so so so good.
This might be the first funeral where everybody just crushed their bits. I was dying laughing the whole time!
Tommy's "women in STEM" line was, by far, the funniest thing that has come out of these roasts so far... and I love these roasts. Tommy boy with the win, I live for humor like yours. <3
I’m watching this video again because it was so divine!!❤
Shayne should dress like that more often, it looks really good on him  Honestly Shayne would fit right in as a JoJo character
Shane did some good acting on this one
Shayne that was literally genius. Professional level comedy. So prepared, detailed, and well-executed. Very very good, and I laughed hard. Major props bro
How long did Damien spent apologizing to the cast after this video?
Imagine when they finally do Ian’s funeral and it’s the one thing that actually gets Anthony to make an appearance.
Amanda's bit was so convincing I was worried she'd keel over there and then
Best roast so far! This was so funny I showed it to other people who don't even watch smosh~
This is the best one yet!
Olivia killed it this episode 😂 Augustus was too good!
Damien was so wholesome, but still brutal!
“We need more women in stem” im spanish I don’t get can someone explain pls
I wonder with her being engaged that Kimmy will be next
Honestly, as someone who doesn't know much about Jojo, Shane was freaking glorious. I never saw the show & I was still SUPER entertained & laughing my ass off. Shane deserves a gosh darn Emmy after that performance!!
Serious question: Is Spencer a trans man?
that japan grave joke was AMAZING 😅
I'm so hyped that this video was #4 trending
Only Damien would immediately ask if everyone else is Ok after HIS roast 😂
Courtney being Dio 😂😂
I screamed and when Dio Shayne came out lmao
Normally Amanda is always the stand out when she’s on the funeral roast. So it says a lot when she’s the 4th-5th funniest roaster here. Wow I didn’t think Shane could top himself & I nearly choked with Rachel
please I DIED HEARING SHAYNE GO " SQUISHY SQUISHY SQUIHSY SQUISHYYY"
I'm only at Rachel's and she's KILLING IT....update they ALL murdered it
idk if i like what dioshayne is doing to me
the pure joy i felt when i saw shayne as dio
shayne’s dio was on point lmfaoo
HO?! MUKATTE KURO NOKA?
Smosh fell off
Nuff ads? Sheesh
Amanda’s characters make me suffocate 😂
Shane’s laugh was a dead giveaway (pun intended)
How does a dead guy have two stars in health?
Shayne's character was IT!
As someone who is high functioning, Rachel is so inspiring for me, and I'm sure for many others. I love seeing her and Damiens friendship!
0:55 straight off the bat probably one of my favourite jokes of all time now. “Sorry, I’m autistic. And also a bitch”
This was the best video I’ve ever seen on the internet
If I'm part of that 8th, Do I get a Prise?
i love amanda’s al pacino cosplay
This was a god damned delight
Olivia Sui's best performance
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!! Damien is one of my favorites!💜
I’m here for shayne as dio that is all
I love thé Way Shane fully commits to his characters. He doesn’t hold anything back and goes all in
This is - quite literally - one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed in my entire life. Get Amanda an Oscar for one hell of a performance!
I'm not sure if this was a funeral or a murder.
The best funeral roast so far 🎉🎉🎉
Olivia god damn killed it.
God i love this video
Can we please get a "after jo jo" cast cosplay 🤣🤣🤣
amanda with short hair is really doing something to me
Baby girl is original smosh, we voted for her
Spencer went hard in the paint lmao
NOT THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rachel's roast was so funny!! That moment where she went in and her face right after, I think that came frome a real place lol.
Very confused about that squirrel bit...
amanda and shayne frikking killed it i lmfao
I LOVE RACHEL AND IM ALSO AUTISTIC I LOVE TO SEE IT OMG
Damian claims to be a gamer... but he only plays on the WRYYYYYY!
just shayne in a wig is my favorite character
THE BLINK IN BOTH EYES REALLY HARD WAS ACTUALLY SO MEAN FUNNIEST SHIT EVER.
Damien woke up and choose violence lmao
Shayne sounds like Carl Heisenberg cosplaying dio
why does Olivia's Augustus sound like Adam Sandler? HAHA
Ya know, Damien does look eternally sick. I wonder why.
The rise of Spencer is something special. It's like Who's line, where the giggles are free, but the points don't matter.
IM 1 8TH OF YOUR AUDIENCE
Now I’m not saying that Shayne should only wear crop tops from now on… but that exactly what I’m saying
Was it just me or was that the most savage one yet !!!
I hope somebody can commit to me the way Olivia committed to the character
If Dio showed up to my funeral i would piss my pants even dead.
ffing God tier this was 💯💯 blown away by all of them
This was one of the funniest roasts to the point that I feel a little bad for Damien 😅😂😂😂. Also, why does Amanda kind of look like a young Jimmy Fallon?
I watch a lot of anime just not JoJo's. But with what I know about Dio from memes and clips that was fantastique
Nice 👍 death is a whole lot better than this
i love you all
THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE YET!
Should’ve started by saying “We’re sorry to say this, but Damien HAAS died.”
Had a Wawa ad come up during this video. When did Ian get hired to promote their free coffee Tuesdays? LOL
This is the best roast yet!! Phenomenal performance by everyone. Haven't laughed so much in quite some time.
I remember when this YouTube channel was good back in the old days
Wryyyyyy
Holy shit… everyone just went so hard on this… these keep getting better and better
all the jojo fans are crawling out of their crevasses  also why dose shane look good as a dio ripoff?
The best one they’ve done hands down
9:45 that's the german genes
damien haas haas died
36:09 - 36:14 DAMN
My possibly autistic, possibly OCD, no-alcohol, queer ass watching this: 👁👄👁
10/10 autistic humor. That was incredible.
at least someone replaced Sarah Whittle with the off camera laughs.
Dio Shayne was awesome.... lol
Holy shit that Dio cosplay by Shayne lmao
The squirrel bit was lame lol but I love it
Olivia's sense of humor has always been debatable, but there's no question, she was hilarious here
wahahahahaha iiyak na amp napipikon si monggi
Anthony-
This was my most favorite Funeral Roast ever!  Thank you for the laughs and the amazing characters <3 JoJo part was so insanely great XD
This was WIIIIIIIIILLD!
Kono dio da
Jojo reference
That one there was a violation
Olivia, Shayne and Amanda were the best! Olivia was a silent killer tbh.
Shayne as Dio is truly the best thing I’ve ever seen
Dio Shayne might be the greatest thing ever so far.
Hi it's me the 1/8 of your audience
F
22:10 damn
Can we take a moment to appreciate just how talented Amanda is?
I was today years old when I found out Damien voice acted Male Shez in Fire Emblem Three Hopes That's awesome, I loved that character and the voice work that went into him, good job Damien!
"Damien's life forever changed after discovering Halloween at age 31" so simple yet so perfect
The point is to act like you're dead
Spencer finally saying what we all wanted to hear.
Even when he's supposed to be dead he's woke!
Olivia freaking killed it in this one omg
True. Tommy is the best
Shayne as Dio was not something I knew I wanted so badly.  Also this was one of the best ones so far.
Wow- I NEED more of Amanda’s and Shane’s characters- soooooooooo talented!
sounds like they all think damiens woke and gay
Holy shit they went so hard hahahaha
Best one yet. Loved it
Amanda is so good at playing broken people for our enjoyment
This got personal so quick for me hahahahahaha Daemien's for life
dio shayne is the best thing to ever have happened 😭😭 his body language is so great
bro, who told them all to go 1000% on this one? 😂
DIOOOOO!!!
Don't worry. Damien didn't forget about acting dead through the roast. He was just dead inside.  And also acting dead is offensive to dead people and should only be done by dead actors
Shayne really went all out
Finally! Been awaiting his death for so long, wohooo! (Sounds so wrong but you all get what I mean)
The ultimate roast with a JoJo reference. Shayne nailed DIO!
WATER GUN KELLY
amanda makes me laugh all the time😂
Shayne’s performance oh mY GOD-
Spencer went wild
i think this is the funniest one yet😭😭😭 the ian one was gold tho even though it will never be on yt🤧
0:34 Mozel Tov 😂
FUCKING DIO!?
Rachel knocked it outta the park!
100% the best roast so far lol each person's bit was spot on!!!!
AS THE ONE-EIGHTH OF THE AUDIENCE, SHAYNE GOT ME CRYING 🤣🤣🤣
Dio Shane is if Shayne and Courtney fusion danced
I clicked because of Shane in cosplay LOL
Shayne’s commitment is otherworldly
They cut my boys Sax bit :( Support Patrick by watching his podcast Artists on Artists on Artists on Artists! (They have a very funny episode with shayne if that sweetens the deal)
Damn, each speaker was a 10/10 this episode.
Siberian Desert lmao
SHAYNE IS AN ICON!!!
Is that a JoJo’s reference??
Was that a motherfucking Jojo Reference?
shayne and spencer absolutely fucking destroyed this, holy shit
16:37
DO PATRICK'S FUNERAL
The fucking wellness check-in at the end is the most Damien possible moment and it was brilliant to leave that in
"AaAAh I BLINKED TOO HARD"  at the end got me
Damien can't even stay dead. The roasts revived him.
greetings from germany. i love the smosh team and finally damien died for this episode. thx guys 😘
Somehow this was the most relatable roast I have seen. I almost felt like I was the one be roasted. Best  funeral roast so far.
this is the best roast they have done so far omg
writer working overtime on this one.  these jokes were all fire
That white blood cell firing line nearly took out one of my lungs.
YOOOOOO THEY WERE NOT LYING!!! That was the best roast ever! Everyone was on point!
They did not hold back today
I fell from my bed watching Shayne scene and laughing my ass off
It's way funnier when the dead one actually tries to stay dead 😕
man this one is PERSONAL
Spencer is so cute
Amanda absolutely KILLED IT
I wonder why there were the non-Smosh rando's before Damien.
Why is shayne dressed as Dio
THEY'RE BECOMING SELF AWARE
As a JOJO fan, Shayne nailed the DIO impression and even had some in-jokes from the anime. The dude's great
SHAYNE DID THE DIO THE THING FROM JOJO HE SAID IT "GOODBYE JOJOOOOOO"
DIO Shayne has no business being that hot
Holy crap this one was just brutal.  Loved it, awesome job everyone.
Amanda 💯 shayne 💯I need a podcast with them as hosts.
I like to imagine Shayne practicing his monologue at his apartment with his neighbors wondering who the hell is Damien and what he did to piss off Shayne 😭😂
Shayne on makeup looks like Beefed up Courtney
This whole thing was brutal! Tommy's classy traditional roast was probably my overall favorite but WTFDIOI'MCRYING! And I love that we're seeing more of Rachel lately.
Damian consistently proving he’s the best with that Kingdom Hearts shirt 😂
I think with this funeral, makes 2022 the year that Damien and Olivia most have interactions. Like four times this year.
Damien after Shayne's bit: "About an 8th of our audience is gonna love that."  Me: I don't even watch JoJo and I loved it!
Ah yes...the Siberian Desert...in the middle of Russia.
Dio?
Did shayne take up sports because where tf did these balls come from
Im sorry,  I thought it was courtney cosplaying as Dio…
conservative speed run any %
I didnt realize how much I needed anime shane in my life til now
DIO Shayne is everything I needed and more
Second best funeral to Rhett and Link's. Nothing's going to beat theirs. But this was close. I don't watch the funerals for youtubers that aren't Smosh cast members. I don't know why they bother with people who aren't even affiliated with Smosh. I've never heard of them and thus don't get a lot of the jokes.  Kind of weird Courtney wasn't there since she's known Damien longer than say Amanda. But it worked. Everyone was perfect. I loved how they made fun of how nice he is constantly .  So funny, and even though i don't watch anime Shayne's bit was great.  I would say my favorite though was actually Olivia. Which is unusual for me, bit she nailed this one.
Olivia has to be the most unfunny person on the planet
Damien received the most brutal roasts out of ANY ive seen XD
20:25 just book marking this joke for myself because I have the same compulsive tic
I was expecting shayne to go "you wad expecting shayne, but it was me DIO!!"
I want a Dio Shayne shirt!
Amanda’s bit had a Chris Farley feel to it, I love it!
Oh my GOD DIO SHAYNE was out if this world 🤣🤣🤣
Early for my standards
Everybody was on fire on this episode!! Except Damien 'cause, you know, he froze to death in a boat fire LOL
My GOD Amanda we don't deserve you 😂😂 You are a phenomenal actress. You have transcended beyond YouTube comedy standards and past SNL alumni 🤣
Tommy, Ian, Shayne and Spencer carry Smosh now 🤣
1. I love Neurodivergence and LGBT representation 2. My brain doesn't know how to feel about Anime Shayne lol
i'm part of the 1/8th of the audience, loved shayne's bit.
SHAYNE YOUR SKETCH WAS ICONICCCCC!!!! I’m LOVING this new character!!!!!
best one yet
Not the dio shayne
Please give Spencer more screen time
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Shayne finally found a way to make every joke a hit.  Just put every punchline IN ALL CAPS!
SHAYNE!!!! THE NAILS! THE HAIR! THE ACCENT! <3 10/10 roast
I see DIO I click
Olivia funny
Who here clicked because they saw Shane as DIO? Oh, just me... Ok
Amanda's roast is next level! Need so much more of this
That Amanda sliders comment was *chef's kiss*
It's about time
I've never been into characters/roleplay so Shayne's RP comedy has never been my thing but that anime boy was lit af.
You can tell Shayne's been practicing those Dio poses.
So glad they used Shayne's ripped body for this
I swear this one is the best, my face hurts from laughing, this is so special (just like Damien)
Honest to god the best episode yet. All the bits hit and had such unique characteristics, but I think Olivia’s was my favorite. Tommy’s ball bit was hilarious too
8:19 Amanda's face is saying "I don't know if this is fun anymore." 😬 😳 Probably thinking "I was supposed to have my funeral next, I think I'll be sick anytime that is brought up..."  🤣
Shayne knocking it out of the park.
“I’m autistic. And a bitch.” My trans autistic ass is USING this, thank you Rachel!!
Amanda is fucking killing me 🤣
Damien wasn't roasted. He was cremated, he was roasted so much that even his ashes disintegrated.
Spencer killing it!
Wow, Damien had Dio at his funeral? Bravo
What's the big picture on the floor. Looks like a cosplay pic
People need to stop doing characters at these roasts... Except Shane lol
This was exceptional from everyone 😂 Gotta shout out to Rachel for making me cackle ❤
I'm the 1/8 of the audience
The legendary dio shane must continue to bloom
10/10 I knew this was going to bang
I want to see a video about the anime brothers they were my fav 🥺👉👈
As an autistic person, where has Rachel been all my life?
It's more important with each of these videos that Keith is the last one to be roasted
They should do Anthony's funeral and have it just be an empty coffin, or have in there and make the joke "At least now we'll know where Anthony is!"
God this was so fucking funny, i hope he got plenty of aftercare for the raw hard Comedy
Holy shit Shayne as DIO was awesome
The most genuine laughs I've seen on these. Multiple shots of people with legit tears. LOVE it!
This was epic.
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Damien's biceps are the size of my car?
But hear me out .. Rachel is kinda cute 😳
I don’t do well on camels!!! 😂😂
Why i do i feel bad at some point for Damien? I dunno HAHAHA just feeling that he's kinda hurt for the roast and try his best to laugh
I'm not even finish yet and this already in my top 2 Funeral Roasts. This one had bangers from everyone with a lot of genius lines.
As a JoJo fan, Dio Shayne has brought be the most joy I've Golden Experienced all year.
Damien’s pool party line was too funny
Believe in Jesus — the Son of God. «Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves those born of Him» (1John 5:1).
1/8 of the audience? Smosh underestimates the power of JJBA meme-worthiness. Even if you didn't watch Jojo you could recognize the memes and some characters from it
One of the best of the series. So funny.
23:13 DAMN
Shayne's performance was phenomenal
I like to imagine Shayne took an Uber to work that day and the driver was VERY nervous the whole time cus he knows what Dio does when he’s in the backseat
I don’t know who Shayne was supposed to be but in my mind he was Johnny Bravo
This was probably the best roast!
#4 trending!!
Are we sure this isnt courtney in a shayne costume
i know we want more DIO Shayne bit in the future 😂😂 this is the best roast ever!
I love how Olivia needed subtitles 🤣
Good riddance
0:30, off to good start!! 🤣🤣🤣
Make Dio Shane a permanent character!
Incredible
Everyone's on 🔥
Worst dead person I've ever seen honestly.
Think and Noah's funeral has to be my favourites now
"He fired his white blood cells for not being diverse enough" is THE funniest thing I've heard in all of these roasts
Honestly, as solid as everyone's roasts were, Damien's clap back was a righteous force.
I never want to see shayne wear anything else. This is a god tier fit
I never knew I needed DIO Shayne until now
amanda is SOOOOO talented omg
I fuckin died at Shane coming in and Damien just being so shocked and excited
love damien waking up and counter-roasting everyone lmao
this was hilarious, Amandas bit was amazing, she should be on SNL, and shaynes bit was so funny :D, great job
This is a masterpiece, start to finish. Everyone absolutely _killed._ I so admire & appreciate the thoughtful, compassionate presence Damien puts out into the world—and the lovingly brutal roasts that arose from it. Really feeling the parasocialism tonight 💙
What Ghost Hunting show is Rachel Evans on
Yey funerals back! Now they can damage Smosh members feelings harder than their careers! 😁
By far the funniest roast thus far.
this is the best one yet. damien wins
Shout out to Damien for being such a gracious roastee, a true ally through and through
best so far
That was the best performed Olivia bit i have ever seen
i have lost count on the amount of times i watched shayne’s part
Kore wa... DAMIEN-NO REQUIEM
Amanda is absolutely incredible. So much talent. So glad she was added to the cast!
Best funeral so far! I was crying laughing throughout.
Everything about this is perfect, I can’t even point out specifics because it was all so good Also I’ve never been so attracted to Shayne
I have never loved Shayne as much as i do in this video And Spencer's roasts were just brilliant
What’s happening, why is the Damien episode the most vicious 😅
Just clicked for DIO to roast this guy I don't know   10/10 worth it
i miss when smosh was just 2 guys messing around
Watching this again, Shayne's "do you understandu?" reference was sick.
I’m glad I chose this video to score my RAADS-R and CAT-Q tests to.
This one felt odly personal
SPENCER'S ROAST WAS GOD TIER
DIO SHAYNE IS AMAZING!! I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED THIS
Why does Olivia’s part have subtitles even thought I can understand her? The others don’t have subtitles on the screen.  *don’t get me wrong I loved everyone in there especially Shayne*
amanda is probably the most hilarious person i’ve ever seen
im not sure how i always end up watching these videos at night when i need to be quiet
Okay but why is Shaynes eyeliner so hot?
This absolutely the best one they all slayed and Damien was amazing as always.
Bro Shayne is too good
Shayne in eyeliner and nailpolish is 🔥😍
This was the best funeral episode so far 😂
bye bye to your bad arts LOLLLLLL EVERY LOSER N0 IS NO LUCK HAHAHAHA
Idk what’s funnier: - Damien clapping back from the dead -Spencer’s Roast - Shayne’s Bizarre Adventure - The Last Will of Damien read by Tommy - Olivia as Augustus and the fact she had to be subtitled because of the lisp - or MSM just improvising and adlibbing his ass off😂😂😂
"about an 8th of our audience is going to love that" *gasp* he's talking about me
Didn’t expect to relate to Amanda’s character. 😅
Holy crap, they didn't pull any punches in this one lol!
The fact I heard Shayne but didn't realise he was in front of camera until they zoomed in
This is absolutely the best one holy shit
shayne as Dio. never knew i needed it, SOOOOO glad i got it
KONO SHAYNE DIO DA
Holy crap Damien was Master Chief???
Now I have a crush on Damien and Rachel 😅
good, i get annoyed by damiens virtue signaling.
Is he still with that one chick?
Tommy's women in stim joke was so fucking funny
Wait...  coattails??
I'm not sure who's actually my dream waifu, Shayne or Courtney. Maybe there's room for both to squeeze in next to Rhett and Link?
oh my god!! damien so savage!! 😂 😂 😂 😂
HOLY shit...  SPENCER!!!
Shayne needs to be stopped. He's becoming too powerful
Shaynes costume is SERVING!! This Roast is one of the best!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS SMOSH FAM!
I wasn't expecting a Cocomelon joke in this; Amazing vid!! XD XD
Out of all the roast funerals, this one felt the most personal
Meh Damien is cool i guess
1/8th of the audience here, thank you Dio Shayne.
The whole episode was funny af
Rachel calling Damien a dumb bi*** is one of the most hilarious things I have ever heard
The fire emblem 3Hopes character at the front is killing me 😭
33:49, even Kimmy got in the roast damn 😂
Shaynes bit was awesome we want more
Best use of Augustus yet.
This definitely seems like they’re using a laugh track on this
I love that Rachel is getting more screentime. She’s really talented. Knew her from Snarled and I’m glad to see her at Smosh. ♥️♥️♥️♥️
You thought it was Shayne, but no! It was Dio!
shayne looked so good idc
Amanda's part was so good 😭😭😭
I need more Dio Shayne pls
These were all sooooo damn good!! Everyone killed it!
Shaynes's bit was just way too good, by far my favorite of all time.
This was start to finish amazing. I can't even begin to pick a favourite but for initial shock and awe, it was Shayne lol. I love how hard they roasted Damien and he got them back so good in the end. Olivia doing a Yelp review of a dead person, hilarious. Amanda choosing to be his voice acting agent, hilarious. MSM showed up and I cheered, he was... so random? Glad we could watch this roast to get in the holiday spirit lol
Thank spaghetti monster that Spencer was here to redeem the first 2.
SHAYNES WEARING EYESHADOW AND PRESS-ON NAILS OH MI GOSH
God dang! Absolutely savage. Bravo gang.  So funny. Good sport Damien.
This was Amazingly done.
Everyone went IN this episode. Savage.
I think they missed an opportunity in not naming this "Damian Haas Died"
Shaynes reveal being so obvious is a bit of a laugh
I loved the dio bit so much. So well done
Omg, Rachel from The Circle!!
Dear God Spencer and Olivia we're straight savage. Damien was a great sport too. Much love to the whole cast! 👻🤣💕
I know this videos about Damien but MORE DIO SHANE
I’m part of 8% of the Smosh audience
I still want Spencer is dead so Shayne can show up as The Chosen
The irony of how brutal everyone was to the boi who always worries if people are mad at him
Damien lowkey "roasting" someone who wasn't even there (Kimmy having a lot of pool parties) was freaking GENIUS
Much roast. Best boi. Holy &%$* the jokes XD
omfg watching shayne hide his laughter through four eulogies before revealing himself (and actually having to disappear for amanda's lmfaooo) was hilarious. and honestly made it even better when he made his dramatic reveal. everyone really brought their A game, this is honestly the best way to honor damien's memory hahaha
I don't care what it is, but I neeeeeeeeeed more Dio Shayne😂😂😂😂
Shayne truly slayed this one.  ... Also it was very funny in general but I think I'm close enough to Damien in personality that some of those jokes had me like "damn 😭".
This was such a good one!!
This has been the best roast so far
holy shit amanda killed it
I'm part of the 1/8
Shayne as dio is actually insane. That pose at the end was incredible
Man. Shayne an Spencer’s roast were INSANE!!
This was SPECTACULAR!!  Shane really should be booking more stuff, he an amazing actor *chef’s kiss*
Amanda seriously looks like Jimmy Fallon, but actually funny.
This episode hit hard!!!!
Those were some killer jojo poses
YO SPENCERS ROAST THO
Olivia ❤😂
dare i say this is shayne's best bit
“I’m sorry if that came off abrupt; I’m autistic and also a bitch” 😂 damn that’s my autobiography right there
i want more Dio Shayne low-key
ill pay money to shayne do more dio
This was the best one by far.
This was perfectly insane
Amandas bit tho... omg she nails it every! frickin! TIME!!! An amazing bit 😂  (Also does anyone else think she looks hot as this character???? Because i SURE do)   .....I literally gasped when Shayne took off the cloak lmao 😭  hes too hot in a crop top 🥲 AND THE MAKE UP AKSVDJJSIW AND THE NAILS AND ECERYTHING GOD DDDDDDAAAAAAAMN this man
Damien is a considerate genius
It's like  Shayne and Courtney were seperated at birth and CF Miller is the evil triplet.  🤣
I laughed so hard my chest hurts omg this is by far the best one, everybody brought their a game and absolutely killed it.
So funny!
when I saw Mathew Scott one Jane the virgin I was so shocked he was so funny
Damn everyone brought some A game to this one. So good
This was Olivia’s funnies roast by far
"Don't make any noise" while Shayne is his best friend is hilarious
This was abso-fucking-lutely awesome
Fun fact squirrel is my favorite game meat. It's delicious .
I don’t think Rachel knocking over the plant was intentional, but it was the perfect start to the video
No one cares get off the internet
I'm about to cry just at the fact that they gave Olivia's character in-video subtitles.
I appreciate Shayne's DIO. Perfectly camp and solidly engrishu
Olivia is just too good at these
DIO SHAYNE IS PERFECT
This is amazing 👏
Could have done without the squirrel bit
Remember when they at least made an effort to try and pretend to be dead lol?
its me. im the 1/8 of the audience
INCREDIBLE episode.
that dio impression was incredible actually lol
Where is lady Shayne?
Shayne's bit was way too good omfg
"About 1/8th of our audience is going to love that" Yes, hi, tis I. Part of the 1/8th of the audience XD
does anyone know when him and the pink haired girl broke up? I thought she would be in this one if they were still together
idk how but shayne's DIO look might possibly be the closest he will be to looking like Courtney
Everyone was so hilarious- but looking at garetts face reflection on the anime painting was funnier 😂
Dio Shayne 😂🤣
as an autistic person,  i could have sworn damien had autism and or adhd and was shocked to find out he's never had a diagonsis
The can’t talk about professional, personal, or private life part was not only hilarious but a good call on Damien’s part. This could’ve been brutal
DIO SHAYNE??!??!?!?! I LOVE IT.
Dio had me rolling 😂😂
Omg y’all top it off every time!!!! Y’all should do a duo with Patrick and Jeremy, also Ian AND Anthony!!!!!
Dude, Olivia actually killed me! This was by far her best performance!
WAS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?????
Shaynes bit had me in TEARS 😂 “being in as a half as many videos as me doesn’t make you a minority” I died 😂😂
also, damien could have at least pretended to be dead a lil bit
KONO DIO DA!!!!!!!!
amanda and shayne are so 😭 you'd think this was an audition for snl 😭😭
Omg, Olivia was fucking brutal!!!!!
Shayne's white blood cell joke was top notch.
0:57 OMG ME!
F#@k, apparently I make up an 1/8th of the audience!
Wait, they didn't even plug the mic in? I love the lack of continuity control in this series. It's subtly ridiculous and it actually suits the show lol.
How is no one talking about Amandas amazing performance highlight of the whole thing
BEST ROAST EVER 😂😂😂
we need more rachel content!!
Shane dressing up as DIO was defiantly not on my 2022 BINGO card
Spencer is ground type and Damien is Electric
This was the best smosh funeral roast😂
I think this is the funniest I’ve ever seen Olivia. I almost pissed myself from laughing. Scripted Olivia and improv Olivia are two completely different people
NOT WATER GUN KELLY OH MY
I thought I'd missed this from a while back because I saw a clip of it just now, but nope. Clippers are fast.  Shayne truly outdid himself in this one.  When Rachel starts with "That was a good *omen*" and no one laughed, it gave me a sad.
Im not even halfway and this is BRUTAL LMAOOOOOOO
Fully expected Amanda to dump the trash in the coffin!
man spencer is brutal in this one
I have been waiting for this
"Only white guy buried in a japanese cementary" then the  *camera zooms in on the only asian there*
I came for DIO, and that's it.
spencer’s set was one of the best of the series so far. that opening line was KILLER
SHAYNE WON THIS ROAST IN ANIME AWW MAN!!!! lol
Shayne was perfect just perfect
The hottest shayne’s ever looked
I thought that was buff courtney
Love the Shez picture in front of the podium
they were COOKING Damien Omg LMFAOOOOO
Uhh Amanda definitely was into Dioshayne
Miss opportunity to call it Damien Haas Die.
That was absolutely brutal and I loved it.
I just saw the pool party on Twitter so when he talked about it,  I was dead
Best roast yet, Amanda Shane and Spencer were PERFECTION
I LOVED Rachel!! I definitely would love to see her more often!
The squirrel eating bit was so stupid but so fucking funny
shayne as dio is ICONIC
Love that I got a mayo ad on this
Ohhhhh damn.....forgot they hadn't cremated him yet
Shayne is one of my fav person to watch on YT whenever he acts. So good, so funny.   Love the fact that shayne went all out for Damien.   Damien looked he enjoyed it.  True friendship right there
I LOVE THEM.
I found myself clapping alone in my room after Shane’s roast
Was hoping for Kimiko
That was the best one yet for sure
Dio Shayne, now I desparetly want to see a anime brothers reunion as jojo.
"Kimmy sure has a lot of pool parties" came straight from his heart.   Brutal 😂
Damien and Shayne are the dynamic duo but Shayne totally got him
Amanda is amazing as always, and seeing Shayne in Dio cosplay was wonderfully hilarious!
I'm speechless (more like breathless due to laughing too much). A masterpiece so far. Wish I could like more than once so here's something for the algo gods. Cheers Smosh.
Dio Shayne is Buff Courtney and I cant unsee
Damian was roasted so hard he couldnt even pretend to be dead
I couldn’t even laugh at Amanda’s bit simply on how enamored I was.
This wasn't a roast, this was the firebombing of Dresden.
The Dio bit was spectacular even adding in some of Dio's best engrish as well was icing on the cake
Probably the best roast so far.
Shayne is having way too much fun 18:14
WOMEN IN STIM
The true MVP of this roast was Amanda. She did a great job
This has been my favourite roast ever
Tommy always goes so hard omg
I miss when the person in the coffin actually tried not to look and try not to laugh and actually try to pretend they were dead
Spencer’s warped reflection in the picture frame the whole video is killing me
not the point but Shayne absolutely served in that cropped shirt-
Amanda is if Tommy Boy had a kid
What's with the crab claw in a coffee mug
Rachel was incredible. More on camera content from her please!
This has to be the most brutal roast they've ever done!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Holy shit SPENCER
Olivia's best performance yet.
As a damnien hater, this video is fucking hilarious, and easily the best roast.
Soft hands is my new favorite insult
This one is definitely on the mount Rushmore of funeral roasts
DAMIEN, CALL THEM OUT! GET TOMMY THAT MAIN CAST POSITION
this is like roasting Butters
I’m only 3 minutes in and it’s fantastic
This is the best one and why is SHAYNE SO PRETTY!
Tommy's joke about stimming is sending me 🤣🤣🤣
Dio Shayne is the best character yet.
Therapy has been going well for Damien, he can’t even play dead 🖤 And Amanda looks like the estranged third property brother…the one without property
Does Amanda work as a double for Nicholas Cage?
Damien is right, I loved shayne as Dio, christmas came early 😍
20:14 I’m that 1/8th
Can shayne just do dio more often please 🙏
Shayne absolutely nailed that Dio parody LMAO just finished watching all of Jjba and really loved that. Over all best roast I've seen!
amanda oddly enough looks like nicholas cage when she was roasting damien LMAO
Shayne is so cute i cant explain it
this was was the most unhinged roast yet. absolutely no filter n we all loved it
this one was good af xD
You expected Shayne Topp but it was me Dio!
How had they not done Damien yet?
So basically Damien is a good person
Damien Ded
Gonna be honest, was not prepared for Dio Shayne. That might be one of the best things to ever come out of these roasts.
Here to defend damien's twitch emotes and for his advocacy for neurodivergent and queer people like me. Love dames 💙💙
this one was brutal, almost hard to watch goddamn i had to take a few laps
I wanna see more of DIO Shayne. No Idea why but I do.
Smosh cosplay contest? Lol
Spencer is the dark horse of Smosh. Most of the time underestimated but will always bring his A game and deliver a banger.
This was the best one yet 🙌🏻 adorably brutal
diverse enough 17:36
Olivia's Yelp-themed roast was FIRE. PURE GOLD!! 🤩🔥❤️
Whenever Tommy GUFFAWS you know the joke is PLATINUM!
love this!
THE DIO POSES WERE SPOT ON
Shayne's bit was so perfect. The way he kept hitting those poses while saying "He probably fired all his white blood cells for not being DIVERSE ENOUGH!"
Shourtney tiller??! Oh no.. Just DIO again
Bruuuuuuuh this was like the most brutal roast yet
water gun kelly 💀
18:51 are we even sure if Shane is a boy anymore
I’ve never laughed so hard at a smosh  roast before 😂😂😂
Inazo Nitobe at 14:48 in the live chat replay. This is a callout to see if this person is correct. If watched you would know.
SCATHING how is he ever going to recover. they roasted him alive. he's singed
The Great Smosh Massacre of 2022 holy shit… also I got a mid-roll ad for mayo????? right before Amanda went on and I can’t help but to think it was somehow Damien’s voice acting agent’s doing.
This was absolutely good!! Shayne, Amanda's, Tommy's,  and Spencer's had some fire roasts my god!! I would love for the next funeral be for Spencer or for Trevor from mythical kitchen!!! Omg I can only imagine the jokes tommy would say
i don’t think DIO shayne understands the power he wields
Every bit got better and better and better. Phenomenal
22:02 😅😅😅
this was so incredible and weird cause it was like they were roasting me too lmaoo
Damien looks like what happens when you mix My Chemical Romance with Ska
Shayne needs to cosplay more
Holy shit Shayne as Dio is the best shit ever. HE NAILED IT. I missed the ZA WARUDO though.
Nice!
<3
Every single one of these that comes out become my New Favorite - they just keep getting better and better HUGE props to everyone in this video all their bits were so so good and memorable except patrick WOW a banger video
Amanda is the gift that keeps on giving. She commits so hard and even throws in body language and mannerisms. She’s brilliant.
I need more Shayne's DIO
20:23 can someone explain the blinking joke?
Um Spencer???????
I can’t imagine how much Shayne had to practice this bit in order to get the delivery, timing, poses, and voice as perfect as he did - there wasn’t a single crack he was fully immersed  Edit: Smosh has gotta clip Dio Shayne soon before anyone else, I’ve already been back 5 times just to rewatch his bit
god I love damien
I told my family I want a funeral roast for my funeral. They weren't impressed. Also,"I'm autistic and also a b!tch" is so relatable I laughed for five minutes. LOVE Rachel 😊❤
Amanda reminded me of Shane Dawson 😂
Everyone else being roasted: *doing their best to pretend to be dead  Damien being roasted: *alert and laughing because he thinks it would be rude not to
Shayne with fake nails, filled-in eyebrows, a karen wig, 1/4 turtleneck sweater, and the voice of george takei has me utterly speechless. i cant tell if i'm witnessing the greatest or scariest video of all time and its probably both.
Omg y’all went so hard on this one 😂
Omg Shayne KILLED IT
Love Amanda
I loved this but....the squirrel bit? Is that an injoke or something? I dont get it.
It makes sense. I always thought that Damien was Disney-princess-level too nice. He always created characters that were too wholesome and forgiving. I always wished he'd reveal his edgy-side. Its great now that I see that the crew and cast agree with me. Damien, we love you for the wholesome and loveable person you are, but please... be the edgy person we all want you to be.  Stop trying to appease everyone. That will never happen. No matter how safe the joke is, someone will always dislike it, but that's their problem, not yours. Let them be mad. You're not the keeper of their emotions! When you make a joke, as long as it makes you laugh, that's all that matters.  Edit: Damien, your comebacks were great. You roasted those bastards like we all hoped you would! Do to the general public as you did to those in this video.
Amanda kinda scared me, and Shayne looks like courtney with that makeup on.
This has been the best one
this one had me in absolute tears. I needed to blink almost as much as Damien does
This was awesome!! Angela should get a roast with a Starkid guest appearance!!
DAAAMN this roast was so harsh, which was really freaking hysterical. Amanda is so damn funny and so damn talented. Spencer killed it, everyone killed it. They all did a seriously freaking awesome job. Damien's clap back was epic too. Everyone was just ON. I give you all a standing ovation. 👏👏
the merch link popping up when Shayne said they made merch of his jokes killed me 19:52 😂
I never watched Jojo, but I don't think it is necessary.
GOD THIS WAS BRUTAL
gdi I'm literally shaking holding my laughter when MSM was delivering his speech. That was soooo good! 😂🐿️🐿️🐿️
I'm 40 and an 1/8 of the audience.
12:47 16:12 20:38 spencer's reflection in the frame picture lmao
I desperately need Trevor and Mythical Chef Josh funerals this season plz I beg of you
This roast was fucking brutal 😂😂😂😂😂 it was so shocking since Damien is like one of the nicest people on the cast😂😂
shayne’s dio was so fucking spot on it’s unreal
This was so violent lmao
So good! Amazing roasts all around. Can't wait for Kimmy and Amanda's.
Shane's roast is so perfect!!
Beautiful
SLAYED. BRUTAL. YASSIFIED FUNERAL. Best funeral roast so far! Been waiting for this LOL
WE NEED KEITH AND JACKIE
Amanda went full Lewis Black. Everyone killed it, outstanding. I feel that the first couple of them need to be redone, now that everyone is comfortable with the format, and going for blood.
Tommy needs to be in more main channel stuff, and recognized for it by whoever is in charge over at smosh
This was one of the best funerals yet! Amanda's commitment to the character was GOD TIER. I love these yay-hoos
Anyone a little confused by Matthew’s squirrel story LMAO what was that 😂
I never knew I needed Dio Shayne until now
I think the roasts have become one of my favorite videos on this channel.
Look how they all ate that 👏✨✨
MORE DIO SHAYNE PLEASE IM DYING OVER HERE LOL
Jesus Christ they OBLITERATED Damien. Best roast yet!!!
Shayne! Wow, what a performance!
dio shane NEEDS to be a reoccurring character! like pleassssssss💀💀💀
Amanda's part was like if Nicholas Cage was a Muppet xD /pos
Man this series is definitely one of my favorites, along with who meme'd it, I'm fairly newer to the channel but I enjoy the content you guys make it's really fun :)
I don’t understand Tommy’s Women in STEM joke. Can someone explain it?
😬 that was the harshest roast so far
I thought they killed him already 🤔
We know Damien’s roast would be glorious. This did not disappoint 😂
Shayne was  the OG in this one lmao!
This was the best episode of the funerals yet
Is still nobody gonna comment on the fact is says “MY FAVORITE COFFIN” on the coffin??
Epic! Absolutely Epic Performance from Shane lmfao
All i can think of is the eat or yeet episode where Damien talks about just having his roast. OOF!
Shayne doing an entire JoJo bit was exactly what I was hoping for when I heard Damien died.
Shayne sounded like Mr. Perfect Cell at times 🤣
Also Damien, I think MORE than an 1/8th loved the Jojo reference <3
Love DIO shayne so much Great reference
I’ve been waiting for this since before they even introduced the format
Nothing could have prepared me for Shane as Dio! Omg I’ve never laughed so hard in my life 😂
How much for the 18+ photo shoot of DIO Shane????
This is my favorite one yet! Oh my lord Spencer ANNIHILATED Damien I could not stop laughing
In my opinion these videos were starting to lose their flare as a video format but THIS went hard and I found myself laughing out loud in the middle of a café. Well played.
This was the video I didn't know I needed but the hype was SO worth it!! Everyone came packing heat this time but Shayne and Spencer launched nukes!
Why are Shayne and Courtney morphing together as one person? 😂
I’ve never seen JoJo, but something tells me that the Dio impression was ridiculously spot on 😂
This was far and away the funniest funeral video they've done yet. They really let loose.
I wonder if Damien got to fight all other dead Smosh members he said he'd fight with?
If Matthew Scott Montgomery is going to do one thing, it’s commit. 😭🙌🏾
This was ICONIC!
Watergun Kelly sent me to the fucking ether god bless you spencer
This was fantastic omg
Shayne’s Dio is right up there with Redacted as my favorite funeral bit. Third place is every will reading
IT WAS I, HOT TOPIC DIO!
I think Olivia gets to keep Augustus now.
THIS WAS BRUUTALLLL DAMIEN WAS SWEATIN
By far my favourite 😍
Damien will always be my favorite
The "Damien should stay on Smosh Games" one, but unironically
Is this a JoJo reference?
where Anthony
That’s not real recording
Spencer had me dying more than damien
Damn shayne looks good as dio 👀👀
I have never been more attracted to Shayne, than Dio Shayne. Holy crap.
woahhhhhh why is Amanda's character as a dude so attractive
I freaking love Amanda omgggggggg
Yep, Damien’s awful. The roast confirms it.
I loved the dio bit lmao
This has got to be one of the funniest ones yet 😂 They did not hold back and that made it that much better
i’m very attracted to Shane dressed like this….. and the nails, the hair, the eye makeup. pls shane
We know SHANE WATCHES A LOT OF ANIME
ngl that was probably the funniest olivia has been in a while
Shoutout to being in the eighth of the audience that Dio bit was aimed at.
i've only seen maybe two episodes of jojo but i'd like a reboot with shayne as dio please and thanks
We want Shayne Dio vs. The Chosen!!!!
I have no idea what Shayne was referencing but still funny af
A joke in honour of Damien's hair:   A purple man lived in a purple house, in the middle of a purple forest. As he was hungry, he open the purple cupboards of his purple house, in search of some purple food... but the purple cupboards were bare. He grabbed his purple bow & arrows from behind his purple door, and strode out into the purple forest that surrounded his purple house. He strode through the purple trees, of the purple forest, until he glanced upon a purple deer, of the purple forest. He notched a purple arrow to his purple bow; drew back on the purple bowstring, and released. The purple deer fell... dead.   Immediately, purple guardsmen jumped from behind the trees, and surrounded the purple man, forcing him to the purple floor of the purple forest.   "You, the purple man, have killed this purple deer, of the purple forest. The purple forest is owned by the purple King, as too are the purple animals. Therefore you, the purple man, have killed the purple King's purple deer. You must pay for your crimes," they scolded.   The purple guardsmen dragged the purple man through the purple trees, of the purple forest, until they reached the purple castle, of the purple King. They dragged him over the purple drawbridge, through the purple portcullis, through the purple courtyard, through a purple doorway, down a purple corridor, through another purple door, until they reached the purple throneroom of the purple King, where sat the purple King upon his purple throne. The purple guardsmen threw the purple man to the purple floor, at the feet of the purple King.   "This purple man has slain a purple deer, of the purple forest. Your purple forest, my King. Your purple deer," stated the purple guardsmen.   "You... the purple man, have killed MY purple deer, of MY purple forest?! Guardsmen... take this purple man to the purple dungeons!" yelled the purple King.   The purple guardsman yanked the purple man from the purple floor, and marched him out of the purple throneroom. They marched him down a purple corridor, through a different purple door, down another purple corridor, through another purple door, and down a long & winding set of purple stairs... until they finally reached the giant, purple door of the purple dungeon. The purple guardsmen pushed open the purple door, of the purple dungeon, and flung the purple man inside, and shouted... "INDIGO!"
Amanda does the best characters
God damn this one was good
The Shez picture
Amanda looks like ted mosby lol
Damien, you thought you shared your first kiss with Shane, but all along, IT WAS I, DIO!!!!!
As someone whose tick is blinking both eyes suddenly really hard…well. This.
Every single joke in this video landed _hard_  Also, as I'm making my way through to my own ASD diagnosis some of these had me in tears
*_"Lime disease from all my ticks"_*  Give this man an Emmy
God fucking damn DIO Shane took the cake for me
Still in the Racheal bit. I clicked for Shayne as dio. Can't wait to see it. That and Tommy as the will reader  Edit: We need more Dio Shayne. Last year, next year
Best roast yet!
Shayne as Dio was incredible. If we could get more skits of Dio Shayne I would love it.
shayne's dio laugh is wonderful
What about Courtney fucking miller's funeral?
DAMIEN CLOSE YOUR EYES MAN YOU'RE DEAD
The comment about Damien firing his white blood cells because they weren't diverse enough and Amanda being Olivia with the sliders set to Maximum absolutely killed me. Great roasts all around.
When did Amanda turn into a partial Gilbert Gottfriend?  She should play him in one of those seance videos.
HOLY HELL can Anime Boy Shayne be a regular character in any and all videos?! Thank you very much yes please
"Died in the blink of both eyes, really hard" I genuinely almost passed out laughing at this
Man I'm.. I'm gonna have to draw Dio Shayne. Needs to happen omg
When scripted, Olivia is actually really funny
Is autism like a new fad or trend? People, maybe more idiosyncratic or neurotic than most, now label themselves as autistic? Why?
He died the way he lived, being the funniest member of Smosh.
Everyone brought it today. I think this is my favorite roast!
Amanda’s Chris Farley energy had me rolling 😂
Matthew Scott's squirrel bit was so good. Like wtf? 😂
I didn't know I needed Dio Shayne until now omg that is a LOOK
Shayne freaking DESTROYED me and I don't even watch that anime 🤣
I was confused hearing Shane and not seeing him… then Dio showed up. I was laughing but tbh I don’t know what I should’ve done when Shane got it pretty damn accurate.
Kinda want my actual funeral to be a roast now
did shayne get a sick pump for this? probably
Is this a JoJo reference?
Ah Damien Haas, the voice of the only Fire Emblem protagonist that’s never getting into Smash. He will be missed 😔
Dio shayne is giving me a sexuality crisis and I’ve been comfortably labeling myself bisexual for 15 years 😂
I definitely DID NOT think Shayne was dressed as Court at first, not me, no way, nuh uh 😅
well shit, this was to damn funny.
Nobody can ever make a joke about Shayne not being Damien's best friend anymore, best friends for fucking life confirmed right here, lmao
Amanda’s was amazing
This might need to be added to the Geneva Convention for War Crimes.
"The only white person to be buried in a Japanese cemetery." -AMANDA 2022
Ive been WAITING for this one
OH MY GOD MY STOMACH HURTS IM LAUGHING SO HARD! this was so savage everyone was so funny
Shayne has no right to be that funny.
Can we make Dio Shayne a thing?
Raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by this roast even though it wasn't even about you 🤚🤚🤚  😂
love the Jojo reference XD
This roast video was so epic, everyone did such a fantastic job on their segments. Rachel, Spencer and Shayne roasts were my favorite and so funny to watch.
Does Rachel have an origin of love tattoo???? I have the same one ♥️♥️♥️
SPENCER OH MY GODDD
SHAYNE AS DIO!!! if i needed any more proof that i like Dio and jojo men, this was it
shayne has to play live action dio now its decided
Why are Damien’s so mean spirited compared to like..all the others?
Do you think Shayne contoured his abs? They look god tier.
I like the guy in the back  ( he is always there) this time with blue hair.
kimmy pool party
Is it just me or dose Shayne look really good with black nails? 💅
Dio Shayne is so pretty ✨
We need more Dio Shayne
Shirtless Shayne! Yessssssss!!!!!
not even five minutes in with rachel and I'M deceased
16:35 Dio moment
Amanda looked so so good
Amanda is so great at characters, I wouldn’t be surprised if she stayed up all night mainlining H and somehow grew a 5’o’clock shadow just for the bit 😂
you guys still alive?
Why is Shayne as Dio such good casting WHAT
I love how Shaynes roast is just him as a anime character. Not even the character, just him in a wig with an anime voice.
I like how "Shayne in a wig" insinuates that any other time that Shane is in a video it's him covering his true personality, dio Brando.
Amanda.  That is all.
That's it's. That the funniest thing I've ever seen on Smosh. Maybe the internet. Holy shit. You thought this was a funeral roast, but it was ME! DIO! Omg. That was the ultimate Jojo meme. Everyone was amazing. Amanda fucking crushed it. I had to pause the show for a second to catch my breath and stop laughing because I was missing jokes in my hysteria. Tommy was brutal as always. Spencer was peak ass hole and I loved every second of it. And God damn Rachel kicked it all of perfectly. Amazing. Just. Holy Fuck. 🤘
This is my fav one~! So funny, shane and damien was amazing. I love the big pic of Shez there too~!
quality roast from everyone 👌  wonder when sax man’s turn to roast 😂
Spencer needs to be tried for war crimes for his “scorched-earth” roasting policy. 😆
Alundra Blayze is keeping it tight
That's OK if Damien is 'squishy,' I want a Damien hug. His aura is amazing.
Spencers roast was the funniest most realist thing 🤣🤣 And Shayne as Anime Rival was top tier 🤣🤣
“If you visit Damien, you have to try virtue signaling.”  Omg 😂
This roast was 90% "he's too nice", 8% "autism and tics" jokes, 1% "WEEB!", and 1% Augustus. Look, man, if I die and the meanest things people can think to say about me are "he was too nice", I'm dying happy.  Oh, and as a non-weeb who's only watched a few animes, I've never seen Jojo, so my first thought upon seeing the lower third proclaiming Shayne as Dio was that moment when Matt Mercer and Marisha Ray were on "Um, Actually" and both hit the "It's me, Dio!" pose at the same time without planning it.
The only one I didn’t like was the first roaster sorry but I have no clue who you are
Alright, this was incredible on both sides of the roast. Arguably the best one yet.
The lack of appreciation for Oliva's bits in these comments ...
I can't stop re and rewatching Shayne's bit :D Also I really really love any joke or bit that does roast but is either phrased in a way that it doesn't seem like  an insult, and roasts that are indirectly complimenting the person, THOSE ARE THE BEST
Why is no one commenting on Olivia's roast as Augustus? It was genius and devastating 🤣
This roast was lethal. Up until Damien started firing back, I was genuinely on the fence of like..."is this cool?"
augustus is 100% autistic too
If this roast taught me anything (other than loving Smosh and crew), it’s that there is a difference between a comedian, and a comed-Ian.
God damn it Dio Shane was brilliant 🤣🤣
That is the hardest I've laughed at one of these. You guys keep stepping it up
no wonder courtney wasn't here, she fused with shayne 🤣
Bro I couldn't even imagine being in that room when Shane dropped the robe.
Honestly we need more Dio Shayne. id pay money for that.
There aren’t enough comments about Amanda. She’s a PROFESSIONAL comedian 😭😭❤️ it really reminded me of when SNL was at its peak. The great clear character types, staying in character and whenever she was about to drop she used it in character. Just so good.
In my opinion the most talented funny people on smosh no particular order are Shayne, Damien, Amanda, and Tommy
Everyone hit it outta the park this time! Loved seeing Matthew Scott! Shayne and Olivia's bits were spot on.
Shane is a comedic genius
This roast is making me realize the similarities between Damien and myself because I'm feeling kind of attacked  I might have worked from home today because my cats fought (they get really violent)
Was anyone else staring at Spencer’s reflection in the photo on the ground
Fun fact:  Real PC gamers don't give a fuck  about the opinion of the alphabet people.
im surprised they did one of these with damien, he does not seem to take jokes directed at him as well as everyone else.
Okay, but wtf was up with the squirrel bit? Did i miss something?
🗑️
Spencer looks like a handsome young man in this video. He cleans up well.
I adore the fact that Shayne did a DIO cosplay for this, but I must mention that he forgot the green lipstick for it.
It would be Damian that ruined the format. He didn't even try to commit to the bit.
Amanda’s character work though…hilarious!
Shane looks like such a good dio omg
Amanda really channeled Kramer energy
As an autistic person, I ADORED Rachel’s segment
This roast seems alot brutal than the other
Damien came back from Hell and roasted everyone with that fire 🔥 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Loved this episode, but the squirrel section was.... bad, unless I was missing something
The whole time I was just like  STOP, HE'S ALREADY DEAD
Spencer is an absolute roast Lord!!
This roast was sooo good, I feel like they all really kicked it up a notch here
Crews roast is always top tier.
12:25 Amanda is so wrong for this😭
Oooooooh noooooo Dioooo! Omgggg   Your welcome it was finally said
water gun kelly might be the best thing i’ve ever heard
10/10
love this, Amanda was hilarious.
Oh my God this was EVERYTHING! The back roasting at the end? Holy shit how can you be so polite YET ROASTING back all of your friends while simultaneously roasting yourself too? Also have to mention Shayne bc HOLY SHIT THE COMMITMENT OF basically learning every line? Wow! (Although I have to admit kinda missed Courtney and Ian from these people) ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We need more Rachel contentttt
Shane as Dio is the most amazing thing I've ever seen
best one yet!!!!
Look how they massacred my boy, my baby boy son, my kid brotha 💔
bro i was gonna be quite upset if i didnt see olivia as augustus 💀
This has got to be my favorite funeral roast ever! Everyone was fucking incredible I'm crying
9:51 Amanda saying baby is cute, she always talks like the fun aunt at a party
5:39 as a cat owner myself, I'm offended for Damien's cat
*WHY DID THEY GO SO HARD ON DAMIEN IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHERS? HOLY SHI!T!* Poor Damien.
This is my favorite by far I was dying the Whole time
Damien is the least dead person in one of these videos ever.
Amanda's characters are always phenomenal
Actually in love with Spencer
Tommy's adam and eve joke is so underrated. I died
Shayne killed it XD
“im autistic and also a bitch” MOOD
god the jo jo costume is absolutely killing me, and the constant anime vibes made me scream XD
Shayne as Dio has the same energy as Courtney Freakin Miller in the video where Courtney did their makeup. And I’m oddly attracted to both.
Spencer and Rachel absolutely killed this
Also Damien I just wanna say thanks for talking about your OCD, it’s still such a misunderstood condition and so seeing people shed light onto the everyday experiences of this condition is really great!
"I'm a literal ghost buster." So a con artist, got it.
Trying to imagine someone who’s never heard of Smosh watching this as their first video
Amanda looks like a stressed out Jimmy Fallon 😂
Almost literally 20 seconds in and Damien IMMEDIATELY frigging breaks character.
Shayne Jojo posing at every punchline killed me.
Matthew isn’t even funny
I'm in love with dio shayne, he so darn hot
What did tommy mean when he said it happened in the blink of both eyes really hard??
Wow! Another banger in this series! Legendary roasts from ALL!!
Everything was hilarious except for the squirrel thing, could've done with that
Dark Damien at its finest at the end
Oh... clicked on this Smosh video after not having seen any Smosh videos for about 12-13 years. This is..... different.
I think I view Damien as such a pure soul that I was genuinely worried everybody was gonna be too mean, but seeing him laugh just as hard as I was made that worry go away lol
In. Credible.
Not Damien secretly hating us squirrel friends.
I’m a person who has OCD and is currently exploring an autism diagnosis, I love Damien and Rachel so much
so good
This is absolutely my favourite one now. Especially Damien's resurrection roasts; I had to keep pausing to catch my breath
I'm a part of the 1/8th of the audience. So good
Damien Haas? More like Damien Haas died
Damien’s revenge tour was great
So true. Damian has become so fucking annoying lately
Can we have more Dio Shayne?
The Cringe is strong with this one. Everyone did amazing.
So. Many. Commercials :( Ever five minutes basically 😮
This is by far the absolute best funeral roast yet
HOLY SHIT IS THAT A FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE
Olivia and Rachel came SWINGING today, and damn, I will always love the Augustus shtick. I don’t even like Olivia much but she did great this time.  Spencer came out with some SUPER topical and AMAZING jokes, man. Goddamn he was good. “Hims was such a heckin good boi” KILLED me.  I sincerely think Shayne should’ve been last. Maybe like a surprise cherry on top of the roasts, cuz I like Tommy— but DAMN it sorta bothered me. Shayne is so fuckin funny with anything he does, and him as DIO was just phenomenally funny.
i'm autistic and i absolutely loved this! thank you rachel (and damien's approval of jokes) for showing how we can absolutely make jokes about it without being harmful. love y'all <3
This whole roast was fire! IMO every joke landed. Hope y'all can keep these going.
DIO Shane is perfection Thank you shane for this gift
Damien's Voiceover Agent is giving Chris Farley in a big way, I expected his van to be down by the river
impressive that damien could roast them all back in the end after rachel and spencer turned him into dust also god dang shayne im looking
Shayne's Dio was so accurate holy shit
they should’ve just titles it damien ha(a)s died
Shayne looks like Courtney
This was amazing lol.
Not only is Shayne's bit probably the best of the episode, he got literally every pose perfect, while still nailing his delivery. Honestly super impressive
Ngl as a fellow autistic, I've always kind of assumed Damien was on the spectrum as well.
Gold
HHOOOO MY GOD THIS WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE GAWD DAMN
Damien is by far one of the most lovable people
MSM's revelation was nuts. Does this mean Damien liked chippendale furniture?
This was the most BRUTAL roast holy SHIT. everybody went the fuck off. Dio was an EXCELLENT touch.
I didn’t see Amanda’s character for more than two seconds and I was immediately floored
Dio Shayne was an unexpected but welcome surprise!
Of course the roast of Damien Haas ends with him asking everybody else if they were good.
Not even a roast, but a straight up cremation.
Might just be my new favorite Shayne character
Damien <3  This was HILARIOUS! Good job everyone! :D
I will be saying the phrase "wtf are the muscles for soft hands you've never had to fight for anything a day in your life" at any chance i get
Honestly, it's such a compliment that they had sooooooo much material 🤣
Yes, Shayne as Dio was hilarious but more importantly props to the hair and makeup dept and whoever did his nails because I knew he was hot but the gender he served today made him even hotter 💅🏽
RACHEL WAS AMAZING!!!!
Shane's DIO is spot on lol  Like scary accurate to the point where he had to have watched moat of part 3 to get this down lol
Happy to be one of the "1/8 of the audience" who loved Shayne's Dio. IT WAS SO GOOD
Not enough women in STIM was an A+ joke
30 minutes of pure roasting. These guys are insane.
The one time the "roastee" could have died from laughing too hard, there were some brutally funny lines being fired!
The jojo jokes got me dying
HOLY SHIT this was a fucking killer
Damien's Voice Agent lost his wife? I know of a certain female detective who's super-divorced and she just wants to smoke in here.
Dio shayne was something i didn’t know i needed in my life till today
Damn everyone came out swinging!!!!
So, your humour is the same as star platinum
Amazing that Shayne did all that without a script/ notes in his hands. Bravo!
Amanda, Shayne and Matthew Scott made my day!!!!
How funny would it be if on the Christmas live show, we got Ian's funeral,  and a surprise appearance from Anthony. 🤞🏻😂
Everyone: "preceeds to praise the roasts and how funny they were"     ME: OMG SHAYNE'S NAILS ARE BEAUTIFUL 💅❤‍🔥
Petition for Damien’s voiceover agent to somehow be related to the Irish family from Legacy?  He needs to be recurring somehow. Love Amanda! 😂
Can we please see Jackie is dead funeral next?… I love these videos so much
Damien Haas is now Damien Haad. He haad a squirrel eating problem.
20:12 "About an eighth of our audience is gonna love that."  It's me. I'm the eighth.
So...the important question. What would be the name of Shaynes stand?
Shayne was too good. I need to see him live action Jojo now
The whole cast went so hard on this video. Probably the most epic roast they’ve done. Great job to everyone!
I'm ALSO probably on the spectrum and looking to be diagnosed!! And my friend also roasts me about it in good fun. You and I are one in the samien, damien
Okay but like...Dio Shayne can *get it.*
Give me Shayne as Dio merch please
Amanda looks like she's cosplaying as Al Pacino
Just when I think this series can't get any better, you drop THIS masterpiece Also, Augustus is now Olivia's Character, I'm sorry, she NAILED him in this and Damien could NEVER do that spit!
Olivia was so brutal
''Wtf are the muscles for soft-hands?''  wow
I'm going to be honest, I thought Saugerties would be roasting Damian too
Damians voiceover agent = Sandy Goodman
What the hell!Every single one roasted the heck out of him!I thought tommy was savage most of the time but this episode every single one of the roasts were savage.
RACHEL. SOOOO GOOD. WHAT AN OPENER.
*SMOSH!!!*
when Shayne did it al in Dio's look a like I did almost laughed so much I cried 😂
Just witnessed a murder. Goddam
I was literally thinking that Amanda just used the same voice she does for all other characters then Tomey hit the perfect joke about it😂
Why are Shayne and Courtney never on the same videos anymore?
hearing shaynes laugh the whole time was so funny
I love Damien so much 😂😂😂❤️
Yeeees! I've been waiting for this day to finally arrive! (Not the Damien part dying)
The theme of Damien virtue signaling , when you take the fact he works AT SMOSH, is kinda crazy when you think about.
Amanda has Chris Farley energy, so funny.
this is my favorite thing
Like if you’re part of the 1/8th that got the dio reference
You thought it was Shayne roasting Damien, but it was Dio!
To get ready for her role Amanda ran a 5k marathon before hand.
holy shit, olivia!!! when augustus said roast he means ROAST
I guess I didn't realize Damien's agent was Shane Dawson
You have to appreciate it when a lot of jokes were 'Damien lives his life trying to be kind to others, especially those in marginalised groups that people are often cruel to'.
This was truly wonderful. My favorite funeral... wait no that sounds bad...
Oh my God DIO Shayne needs to make a return lmao. Those anime villain laughs were to die for lmao.
0:30 Rachel 4:00 Yelp 7:57 Spince 11:09 VO Agent 16:30 Dio 20:19 TomBow 22:52 Matt ScoMo 27:55 gasp
The autistic representation we needed. May or may not have actually cried.
The most funny death-roast, and the most funny scene they have ever done in my opnion. its not ofter,EVERYONE killed it! Amanda and Shayne especially, as I've hoped they would. Wow! This one wil prob be my go to video for the entire 2023 when I'm feeling down for something...  Great Job!    Oh, and WHEN is IAN going to die and Anthony come back to roast the shit out of him? =)
Is Damien ok
Huge fucking props to shayne for full sending that dio character
i need more of dio shayne
Your supposed to murder him BEFORE the funeral, not DURING
Rachel coded and Rachelface were hysterical
I really feel the last year, and even more so the last 6 months - Smosh has come into a new "prime". Fantastic
AMANDA DID THAT.
Damien has a hard time staying dead
Damien has gotta be the least dead dead person ever
Phenomenal. Just. Brutal and awesome and everyone is DONE FOR. I knew Dames would come back for y'all with a vengeance but D A N G.
is it me or is there way more people laughing in the back ? it feels like a laugh track
Looool Damn Olivia and Spencer  And wow Shayne... Just wow lol
Can anyone tell me who Shayne was supposed to be? 😅
Why is Shane Dio just Courtney.
Anyone else wanna know what Damien wants to congratulate Patrick on? Or was that literally just a joke to get to Shayne? xD
Just off the bat “Damien is autistic the same way taco bell is Mexican food
This might be the GREATEST one yet.. Everyone from Smosh brought it
olivia OUTDID herself holy shît.
Shayne would be great as Dio in a Smosh take on JJBA
This is the HARDEST that absolutely EVERYONE committed to the roast. There were zero lulls, just have after jab. Rachel was an amazing addition and, as always, Amanda committed soooooo fucking hard to the character. This is the one to top.
If they ever make a live action JoJo movie, they better get Shayne to play Dio.
Shayne, the consistency!!! I can't!!!! and Amanda, you are always on peak!
Tommys opener oh lord 😂😂😂😂
ᗪㄖ　ㄚㄖㄩ　ㄩ几ᗪ乇尺丂ㄒ卂几ᗪ　？
I don’t think Damien was dead at any point in that video lol
Amanda was great
i swear i thought it was courney on the thumb
20:25 excellent
This was SO FUNNY
this one was too good 😭 Amanda and Spencer killed it yet again
Shayne killed me! Holy crap!
Shayne committed 500%
This roast was fire, everyone was amazing, but Shayne as Dio just wow, next level, I love every second 💜
damn this was a good roast
20:00 masterpiece
Long live Damien Haas
yoo a jojo reference dio roasting damien...good voice acting...
"about an 8th of our audience is gonna love that" XD
Oh my god Water Gun Kelly had me WHEEZING! This entire video from beginning to end is just gold. I foresee rewatching this an obscene amount of times. Bravo!!!
I literally just started watching Jojo 3 days ago,  and I'm 3/4 the way through Stardust Crusaders. So fucking glad i did because dio Shane is muy perfecto
Why is this video not called Damien Hass Diedd?
I didn't know Jimmy Fallon was Damiens voice over agent.
Tell me why Amanda straight up looks like Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest, when the aliens come to take him with them for the first time.
I think this is my favorite and the best roast yet. Everyone absolutely KILLED it. From Shayne Dio, to Spencer, Mathew Scott, Rachel and of course Damien's VA agent and Augustus. Even Damien's own roasts were hilarious. Reminds me why he's been my favorite the past 5 years.  Shame this video was so good it was over in the blink of both eyes, really hard. 😔
God those press on nails on Shayne are everything
Dude what has smosh become… i havent watched yall since before anthony left… this isnt even smosh anymore
Damien mentioning Doug made me desperately want him to show up on smosh somewhere somehow
Holy hell, they are really starting to get ruthless out here. My sides hurt from laughing holy hell
They really roasted him 😂
I feel like it should be called Damien Haas Died
if your best friends won't cosplay for your funeral roast, are they even your best friends?
Spencers roast was possibly the finest ive ever heard
I've never JoJo'd but this was still extremely funny 😂
I love Shayne trying to laugh in character in the back when tommy is talking
ngl Shayne pulls off DIO really well
everyone popped off i’m so proud
As a fellow Damien, this was very much our brand lmao
Damien Haas? More like Damien Haad
dio shayne is just buff(er) courtney    or perhaps yassified courtney freaking miller
how does shayne somehow look hotter?! he should wear acrylics and highlighter more often!
This is best SMOSH roast. Everyone did great. 💀💀
Kind of loving how hard everyone went on this.
They really said roast huh
Shayne could not keep it together sitting there waiting for his turn 😂
Having my favorite character from my favorite show be played as my favorite person from smosh is… incredible
that was the first time i've enjoyed a jojo reference since 2015
I know Shayne is cosplaying, but why does he look like Courtney?
Another amazing character from Shane
BEST ROAST EVER.
Shayne is a foot too short to be DIO; but I had no idea how badly I needed to see it until I did.
Loved everything besides the squirrel eating it should have ended before that.
You all expected a man named Shayne Top? Too bad! It was me, Dio!!
Rachel is so relatable. I too have autism and this feels like how I would roast.
I think this is the best vid in funeral roast!! amazing work!
Everyone killed it, but Amanda had me pausing the video to snort-laugh!
DIO!!
FUNNIEST ONE
Tommy, the dig at being Shayne’s other half was absolutely insane. thank you for this
This was one of the top Funeral Roasts! Damien, you were such a good sport and everyone was hitting so ffffing hard, but you can tell it's all out of love. Love this channel so much ❤️  Side note: So glad Noah intro'd the resurrection roasts as they have become a great staple, but it's a shame everyone before him never got a chance to do it.
We need more DIO shayne
Shayne's been putting in extra time at the gym and wants us all to know about it. I'm cool with it.
Shane as Dio was something I never knew I needed but was the thing I needed today
Rachel is the GOAT holy shit
Anyone else notice how they sometimes reuse laugh reaction clips in these funeral videos? Example: 3:27 and 4:40
Oh my God, I'm fucking CRYING!! 🤣🤣🤣 This roast was absolute top tier! Everyone went sooo hard, but manged to keep it so funny that it never felt mean. And that rebuttal roast *chef's kiss*
Learning that Damien is also on autistictok while not being it is so comforting to me 💜
Idk whats funner that Damien is literally like me or that im didn’t know him that well till now 😂. Oh man i feel like if i had met him irl randomly before he was on smosh we would have been friends
You were expecting Shayne, but it was I, DIO!
Blink of a BOTH EYES REALLY HARD is CRAZYYYY 😂😂😂🤭🤭🤭
Shayne being DIO was fantastic! Would love to see more! 10/10
SHAYNE!! OMG!
I feel like they didn't hold back on this one. Amazing!
Damien is my all time favorite smosh cast member. It's genuinely wholesome that most of the jokes were about how big his heart is.
Just don't forget the keyblades!
Phenomenal
How are you gonna make a joke about Damien using a phone recording of your voice When the Tiktok Voice-To-Text sounds JUST LIKE HIM?
Olivia went in HARD! So freaking good. Also, I just adore Damien. Maybe I need to get around to simping on his streams. Lol, I kid.  Kinda :P
Shayne and Spencer are absolute menaces to society
Shut it dead damien! I get DIOOOO!!!! unless im in the 8% hahah also i hope Ify saw this one, I know he is somewhere cackling
This was the best roast yet. Now I know why they were hyping it so much.
this was the best one so far omg
This was the best funeral yet
i feel like for inspiration amanda dipped heavily into chris farley's matt foley character. well done!
Damn this is the most someone got roasted here 💀💀
This one was the most FIRE DAM
Dio Shayne lmaooooo
Damn. This one had alot of mustard.
God damn it based on that yelp review he just like me fr?! 😨
This was the most savage one yet, I loved it
Olivia Is committed
WOMEN IN STIM
It's now official that autism is an excuse
Rachel’s roast was epic
Id kill some people to be friends with Rachel hope she sees this
My whole life up to this moment has lead to me watching this roast and I couldn't be happier.
This is by far the best funeral episode that we have had so far. Everyone’s roasts were amazing.
You thought it was Dio. But no! It was me! SHAYNE!!
Amanda had me crying
More Shayne Dio please
This has to be my favorite funeral so far. Everyone was in top form.
Rachel, Olivia, and Spencer were just amazing. Keep bringing Rachel back
Courtney Freakin' Miller's looking a bit different these days.
Shane looked way too good as Dio
Okay whoever made a big subtitle for Olivia's bit needs to go to jail.
Matthew omg yassss 😂
Damian should look into the color indigo, arguably blue and purple
I've been looking forward to this
The savagery
22:39 YESS
DIO
Amanda’s sketch characters are infinitely better than ANY on snl in the past ten years.
This was the most savage episode I’ve seen in this miniseries
Ah Dio Shayne. Wasnt expecting that
1/8 Represent!
Jesus christ, this was nuts. burned his ass UP!
I think Damien forgot about the Dead part in this. He had his eyes open 95% of the time.
I’ve been waiting for this
The Dio Shayne killed me!! And tommy just as always killed it lol😂
The fact that they roasted the hell out of him, they got some frustration out 😂
Fucking. Golden.  Spender went H A M, fucking FATALITY And we need more shayne DIO cuz god damn, also the cosplay fit all too well lmfao.  The jokes landed so hard, jesus christ.
TF SHAYNE'S COMMITTMENT THO OMG
Its time for Tommy to break character and become a jojo villain!
I was hoping shayne would have yelled “THE WORLDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
They may have joked he died in a fire, but damn did Damien get burned.  Has anybody seen him since this was filmed.  Can somebody check on Damien?
I know it's a repetitive comment at this point, but these really do keep getting better and better, I literally choked on my own laughter about 4 times during this one! And poor Kimmy getting lightly roasted when she's not even there, hahahah!
this is 100% my favorite one lol. "It was  me Dio the whole time"
Spence never misses
I never knew i needed to see Shayne as DIO in my lifetime but im happy were are here
AMANDA OH MY GOD insanity. I love her so much.
Shayne looks hot as Dio😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I'm autistic and also a bitch" I FUCKING DIED
Amanda in drag is kinda 😏
While Shayne didn't have the most savage roast, it was 1000% all about the presentation and he nailed it!
Is that a JoJo reference
LOLOLO Damiens shirt in the photo saying KawaII, lol super cuuute lol
Spencer's Water Gun Kelly joke was perfect 😂😂
Had to give a like purely for spencer's roast
This was brutal in the best way possible
Amanda is soo good at this omg
damn the first three already went hard as fuck........................ the most BRUTAL roast istg!!!
THE DIO PERSONA WAS FUCKING PERFECT
please tell me i'm not the only one who didn't get the squirrel thing at all.................
End the series here, nothing will top this!
Easily 15/10! Absolutely hilarious!!!
"sorry im autistic and also a bitch" im autistic and i died
This is probably the most savage one of these videos yet 😂
The fact that there’s a picture of Shez from fire emblem is hilarious 😂
Shayne's Roast was unsurpassed... until now 😂
Damien's roast of Shayne 🤌💋
That most likely the Best Roast so Far. Everyone knocked it out of the park. It started off Strong and continued through the whole video.
hes look like dio
This is awesome!!
I love how ever-present JoJo is!
This is the best one out these series love it Man if this one was a bit on the live tours it would be a hit Man I wish the live tours come back for Houston, austin, Dallas, would love it
Olivia did amazing
I do kinda feel bad for Damian. He doesn’t get enough credit for how funny his characters
Shayne you have to go as DIO for Halloween next year, please, you are necessary for THE WORLD!!!
Damien just like me fr
Why does Shane look exactly like Courtney
Damien literally laying in a coffin having been roasted to hell and back: I feel good, are y'all ok?
Shayne as Dio isn’t something I that I needed but I’m glad it happened
please when is rachel joining the cast she's hilarious
I NEED MORE OF DIO SHAYNE (or just Shayne in a crop top)
Man dark damien was unhinged😂😂
I love how Tommy always makes it an everybody roast 😂
this one was BRUTAL
I just gotta say, Shayne's anime bit is everything to me and must be protected.
This was top 3, everyone brought their A-game 🔥🔥
It’s about time!!!
Not the framed picture of Shez at the foot of the podium LMAOOO
Rachel I love you! Please be on more videos! You are awesome.❤❤❤
Genuine question; Is Spencer apart of the LGBT+ community?
This was one of the best so far
Damien is autistic the way Ian is a Comedian. Gods. That wasn’t a roast of Damien, that was just straight up burning Ian at the stake.
Damn 9minutes in and I thought I was gonna watch Damien's funeral not witness his murder
This has to be the best one yet 🤣🤣🤣
I SPIT my water out at Tommy’s blink of two eyes joke
We need KEITH
This was one of the best funeral roasts yet! Damien, you rock! I don't know much about anime other than they really lean into extreme exaggeration of every movement and expression and Shayne killed it! Amanda was awesome! I love when you guys roast the dead with one of their characters, Olivia's take on Augustus was great! Spencer was hilarious and Tommy with the reading of the will is always top notch.
I love Amanda's character!! I want to see more of it!
Nice
Omg Olivia was amazing! So funny! And Shayne was okay 👍 good stuff
20:15 It’s me, a part of about an eighth of the audience who loved that DIO bit
I'm sad that Kimiko wasn't part of Damien's funeral
Funniest funeral yet
Dio Shayne Dio Shayne
Rachel’s roast was amazing! I’m loving Rachel in these videos.
I didn't realize they were roasting me too!!!
Are there camels in Siberia?
My crush on Shayne keeps intensifying in spite of his best efforts uh oh
Smosh when their viewer count plummets because they made fun of the only subscribers out of the 7 million that watch their videos
Tommy be laughing a little TOO HARD at a lot of the bits jhacjsfvsgvd
The fact that if Shaynes voice was only a bit deeper he could possibly articulate to sound like Patrick Seitz
i feel so mean for laughing way too hard at all of these not because they were the smosh cast giving funny jokes but because they were funny 😭
These funerals are brilliant. I need more. Amanda’s. Garrett’s. Ian’s would probably just be one long Bleep but I’d watch it.
tommy being most funny , I AGREE
My very first thought: oh god Augustus
I feel like this is the best funeral roast yet. This was super fun to watch! Also I'm part of that 1/8th, I need more of DIO Shayne in my life. That was gold.
shayne slayed i fear
Spencer actually killed me omfg. All of them did great but that was fucking amazing.
This might be the best _____ is dead video yet. Absolutely hilarious
Most people did great.  Damian flopped it felt like.  And so did the squirrel story.  Everything prior to that was pretty good.
SHAYNE AS DIO OMG
Damien will always be my favorite...
Shayne absolutely breaking Rachel was amazing
All of these bits were bangers, and so so harsh! I love it!
DIO Shayne is all i needed today. my day is better today thanks to DIO Shayne!!
It's me. I'm the 8th
I like to imagine that Shayne has been working out this entire time _just_ to do that bit for Damien bc they're awesome friends
Did Paige and Damien break up?
Wait is that a Jojo reference?
This is my favorite one!!!
As 1/8th of the audience, I did, in fact, love it. Also here to give some love to (what I’m pretty sure is) Rachel’s Hedwig Origin of Love tattoo.
Shayne's body though!
You thought it was Shane.... BUT IT WAS ME, DIO!
Finally, it’s Damien’s turn!!🤣🤣🤣🤩🤩🤩
Ok true gold was the Shayne saying 'they made merch of mine,' then the merch pop up ad shows. That was pure gold
This was my favorite one I’m hurting
Spoilers:  It starts hot, gets hotter, cools and plummets...
I wish anyone else did Augustus that wasn't Olivia
I'm only 0:29 seconds in.  Seeing the look on Amanda's face I already know this is going to be an amazing ride.
I hope we see DIO Shayne again. Flawless execution!
The devil works hard but smosh funeral roasts work harder. Damien, you're a class act who can dish it as well as take it. This was absolutely iconic. 💜😈
This was by far the best one yet! These literally get better and better every single time
This is my favorite so far!!! Rachel absolutely killed this. I laughed the entire time!
Rachel needs to be in front of the camera far more often, for real.
These roasts are becoming my favorite. They really didn't hold back but Damien's return roast was gold.
Nah Damien's definitely autistic tho
Shayne needs an Oscar for that Dio performance LMFAO
Where are all the JoJo fans at? LOL Dio so freaking good 😂
Was this video a roast or an intervention?
Shayne's DIO absolutely killed me
Finally, somebody I actually know.
Oh man, I laughed so freaking hard. Fan-freaking-tastic!!
Shayne’s DIO is soooo attractive and sooooo funny! Holy shit 😂
Every cast member did a good job but special shout out to Amanda for 100% efforts 👏🏽
I’ll say what my therapist says, if someone is questioning whether or not they’re autistic, they probably are. Allistic people don’t worry about it.
How did we do this for non-smosh people before we did it for Damien
Fucking savage and exactly what I've been yearning for and waiting for, and I've not even finished the episode yet! Everyone really brought their A-game and Shayne fucking knocked it out of the park!! And it's the first funeral roast that I actually think the reply added to the whole thing rather than soured it. Well done, y'all!!
Omg these just keep getting better😂
I thought Spencer's roast was flawless and then Shayne somehow topped it... Jesus Christ
Damn. There have been some savagebroasts on this series, but I don't think anyone in the box has gotten as hard as Damien.
I'm the 1/8
He needed more training.
It’s funny how obvious the “clicks” are now.
Been waiting since he mentioned getting roasted a few vids ago 😆
This is, in my opinion, by far the best of the funeral roasts.
Shayne with painted nails is amazing
I can’t wait for them to do Ian is dead. Mans gonna get dragged.😂
As someone with autism 2 mins I already love this episode so much  Edit: THIS IS THE BEST ONE THEYVE EVER DONE
Rachel went fucking hard af
Lol I hope for damiens sake he gets invited to more pool parties. Lmaoooooo
Spencer 100/10
I doing the big claps
my life's dream to see shayne as dio has finally been fullfilled
Holy shit Spencer, Shayne, and Tommy killed Damien thrice over haha! Such accurate jokes!
Yesss Shayne Yesss
This was by far the best funeral yet
The best one yet. Damien’s roast at the end is iconic.
The Watergun Kelly joke was so fucking good
I think Olivia's Augustus is better than Damien's, and Damien's is fucking stellar.   I don't think I've seen a better emulation of an original character before, and Olivia would have been my last pick to do it so well.   I underestimate her, but she is an absolutely stellar comedian.
You thought I was a Kingdom Hearts villain, but it was me DIO!
Shayne as Dio..made me laugh so much ! ..im dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Didnt this one already happen?
Hey! Is that a Jojo reference?
Just want to say I love feeling included in Damien's greeting and it makes me feel special when he references nonbinary folks. I know it's all jokes and love but he's genuinely such a sweet dude and I really enjoyed him getting some attention!
This has to be the best funeral video so far. Everyone's roasts were HILARIOUS! Especially Damien's roasts at the end wow.
I honestly just appreciate how much Damian stayed awake and happy throughout his entire "funeral." He couldn't stay dead at all the way everyone else tried to just because he wanted to witness what all of his friends put together for him.
I like how Damien wasn’t even trying to act dead
is that DIO?!
Oh my god, Shane's bit was absolutely the best.
This was SO GOOD, as a neurodivergent gay, I loved it
As a fellow neurodivergent, Rachel’s roast made me laugh SO HARD. Also love her Hedwig and the Angry Inch tattoo!!!
Shayne is so fucking sexy goddamn, idk if he had makeup on those abs or what but holy wow
Should have ended Shane's segment with "omae wa mou shindeiru"
This was Shayne's best role in a long time.
One of the best roasts. Rachel, Spencer and Dio were phenomenal
As soon as Shayne dropped his cloak I screamed DIIIOOOOOOO hahaha so good!! Really enjoyed this one :)
AMANDA!!!!! (that’s the comment)
I swore Shayne was a reaper I wasn’t ready for DIO! 🤣
Augustus's was personal. 😬😬
Shayne looked incredible!
DAYMN!  Everyone really brought it! I'm lovin this! lol
Demian Haas died.
I love Rachel's Hedwig and the Angry Inch tattoo 😍
This was the best roast yet, everyone killed that shit! And Tommy is the funniest member at smosh, respek
I wanna see the insanity of Courtney Freaking Miller faking her own death. Cause she would never really die
Best one so far, gosh darn it, Billy Bob
DIO Shayne NEEDS to make an appearance on TNTL.
Moral of the story is, never eat a squirrel. Just don't.
Holy crap! Amanda is olivia with all the sliders turned to maximum!!!
This is the most brutal roast in smosh yet.
Amanda 🤭 my my my..
Best roast ever. 😍 Everyone did an amazing job. Damien we love how open you were here, it helped us with similar qualities be seen. Will rewatch this many times. 😂 Thank you!
Shayne lookin damn good here lol. The eye makeup was incredible on him.
Me when Spencer said he had no bitches: 👀👀👀👀
I screamed from laughter the whole time, this was amazing
Best funeral ever omg
Alright I’m aro/ace but Dio Shane is kinda…
Great video, great roasts! This was one of my favorite funeral roasts so far! Damien, you're amazing!
Let’s blow this up!
Amanda is SNL or MADTV level sketch comedy. Her expressions and delivery are on point.
This was amazing, everyone did incredible but I gotta show extra love for Shane 😂😂😂😂
Amanda. Doesn't. Miss. Edit: but Shayne won the roast
"I don't do well on camels!" Outstanding
An Instant Classic. So many good ones in here. The Amanda joke "Olivia with all the sliders turned to maximum" is a beyond perfection definition. Olivia continues to prove her greatest strength is doing a full character, and she just goes all-in on them brilliantly. Every one of Spencer's jokes hit hard, and every joke at his expense hit even harder! Rachel was a surprise, fantastic stuff to kick things off. Amanda always goes full-on in every character she creates. Tommy continues to be the funeral glue that binds all that cast together despite his "Cast-not-cast" status. He and Spencer are all but cast anyway at this point, for all practical purposes. And finally, Damien brings it home with that excellent "friendly-but-Imma-gonna-fry-your-ass" delivery method that he does so well.
asasas
Alright this was the best one so far 😂😂😂😂
"Noones really sure of his sexuality." I....this is quite true, never thought of it XD
Oh my gosh, I love this so much. 1) you can tell how much they all like Damien, but this is the HARDEST I've seen anyone roasted, lmao 2) so many of their roasts were just about him being so anxious about being inclusive and accepting
I miss old smosh, this is cancer and rapidly declining
i thought everyone’s roasts to damien were brutal, but then he just absolutely annihilates everybody at the end 😭
Shayne's performance was insane!!! 😂😂😂
Best funeral roast performance by Shayne yet
Sheesh that was a wild one... ,anyone else think Amanda reminded them of Chris Farley a little ?🤔
the god of war theme started on my Spotify shuffle when Damien started. Perfection.
This was Olivia’s funnies roast by far
So what you’re saying is Damien has adhd?
DIO SHANE
Watergun Kelly 😂🤣
We’ve been waiting for this one
I love how Damian just gave up trying to keep his eyes closed LMAO
I was wheezing through Dio's roast
I unironically think Shayne should do drag
Shane does a pretty good dio impression XD
this is my new favorite video ever. peak blank is dead for sure
This was hilarious!
OMG Shayne as Dio was the most needed and insanely funny thing ever for this Damien funeral!!
Is there a tusken raider in the audience at 4:23?
Damian uploading his twitch emotes into slack is so funny I love that
Holy shit the crew brought it real hard this time. My personal favorite in this series.
Love that he’s wearing a heartless shirt 😂
I didnt know I needed more Shayne Dio until I saw this video. You absolutely killed it my guy!
Some of the best bits in this one
Amanda steals the show. So damn good every time and keeps getting better!
SHEEEEEEEEshhh Amanda Killed it <3    WTF Shane  i almost choked myself to deatch
God damn Olivia lmaoo
This might be the best one ever.  I laughed so dang hard throughout this, everyone killed it
This was the most overdue and hilarious funeral roast and I'm not even halfway through the video
Shane you killed it as dio best part of the video in my opinion. Laughed so hard. Thank you smosh for another great video.
I wanna see Amanda do a Chris Farley character!!!
This is the BEST roast this season! Really glad to have the SMOSH cast back in the coffin
Jojo Shane was fuckin epic
I was so sure Amanda was gonna play Al Pacino
Spencer knocked it out the fuckin park
"Don't make any noise" while Shayne is his best friend is hilarious
Omg this is amazing 😂😂 this made me live damien even more
This was the best funeral roast! Both the gang and Damien was awsome!
My cheeks hurt from laughing 😂
1/8th of the fandom here we love you dio! So polite to do this make a wish presentation
Soooo good
TOMMY IS SO FUCKING FUNNY
Amanda is a LEGEND. No one can ever match her greatness.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO DROP ALL DAY
Shaynes DIO voice is on point!
Daaaaaamn 😂😂 Tommy did Amanda DIRRTTEE! 😂
Spencer slayed
yep. this is it. this is the one. so so good. every one hit. love
BEST👏VIDEO👏EVER👏
I have watched a ton of roasts like legit roasts, and this is by far the most brutal one I've ever seen. Damien was cremated.
Shayne as DIO is perfection
Not my Damien I don't want to watch his funeral. This is too hard for me. 😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another dynamite performance from Shane! Amanda is a great actress!
You guys were all good 👍 👏 😊
Infinitely better than the last funeral roast; like, who was that bitch!? It was insanely full of cringe.
I can't choose who went hardest. They're all so great
ZA WARUDOOOOO
With the context that Rachel cleared everything with him before, her roast was my far my favorite, so brutal 😂
DIO Shayne is just perfection!
Olivia plays Agustus so  fucking good
Is this a Jojo reference?
I feel like Jackie couldn't be on this, it would be too brutal
Dio shayne is perfect
I felt like the beginning of that one was really hardcore. Olivia daaaamn! xD
16:48 XD
Dio Shane goes hard
Rachel slayed 👏👏
Every time Damien tries to get diagnosed with yet another disorder I like him a lil less :(
Why are all of Amanda’s characters divorced 😂
Just got a Mayo ad while watching this. Seems too perfect.
Hekkin good Boi 🤣
"I’m autistic. And also a bitch."  I like Rachel.
This is the one I was waiting for and it did not disappoint
Everyone killed it! This is easily my favourite *blank* is Dead! ❤
Why does Olivia as Augustus make more sense than Olivia as Olivia? 😂 She kills it every time though 👌🏻
Bro, I need Dio Shayne to be a recurrent character from now on. I didnt know Damian could be this brutal ffs
This was the funniest funeral since y’all did Rhett and Link!! I was rolling!! 😂😂😂 love Damien so much! ❤
I think this roast has inspired me to attempt join the 1/8th of the audience
Imma be his pucci
Ok this was a seriously impressive video. I'm immediately watching it again 😂 Also I've mad appreciation for the fact that the camera keeps panning over to Rachel just dying of laughter throughout
Tommy - “That’s. InCREDIBLE!” 😂😂
This is so good.
So...This may have been the best one yet. Shayne, and this is said as a fan of The Chosen, may have done his BEST work in this one lmao. DIO Shayne was insanely perfect. I will admit, it was hard to focus with Rachel and Amanda in the same video....😍👀😍
Really hope Dio Shayne becomes an occasional recurring character
Dio Shane is just too perfect lmao
this video is 40% people just saying how good of a person he is
What's with all the muscles, soft hands? You've never had to fight for anything a day in your life! 🤣
How did it take me this long to realize that Rachel and I both have an orgin of love tattoo on our left inner arms
WATERGUN KELLY
Rachel's routine is the autism representation I never knew I needed
Bro they roasted this shit out of him and it was amazing
Shane deserves an emmy for this one.
Amanda is to dam good!
I dont watch JoJo but I did love that bit
I hope this becomes a reacurring shayne character
Spencer is a *_SAVAGE_* 🤣
Dio Shayne is making me feel things...
Damien "Haas" died
Dio Shane is officially my favorite 20:07
dio shayne had me in tears, absolutely beautiful stuff
Amanda lookin like Lewbert from I-Carly🤣
Dang, Shayne actually did not laugh at his own jokes at all this time. That's some character development
GOD THIS ONE WAS BRUTAL FUCKING HELL DUDE
if Noah was here, Damien would die for sure mmhmm
AMAZING ROAST EVERYBODY!! You’all brought your A game.
Just bring Anthony back for 1 more video
Rachel clearly was hiding her power level and finally revealed herself in this moment.
Holy crap, Damien got ROAAASTED I feel like no one got roasted to this degree😩😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
not gonna lie, i think this is the first time Olivia was funny on purpose
This was the funniest one. Good job.
There’s onle 2 genders
But amazing video tho. Hi Lizzy
Where’s his gf?
Damien will always be my bae
We need a blank is dead with both courtney and her sister and one with garett
I'm part of the 1/8 that loved Dio Shayne.
I wanna see more DIO Shayne lol
Oh this is i have waited for🤣🤣🤣
I also have Neurologic Tic Disorder, so I laughed way to hard at the twitch/tic jokes lmao
These funerals are the funniest
They went Hard... *whistle* we all love you Damien ❤️💜
Shayne looked FABULOUS!!!!!
I love how Amanda always goes all-in to every character. Genius
Spencer is an absolute legend
Rachel & Shayne are so fucking funny
Amanda is so talented!
Shout out to the 8th of the smosh audience!
Rachel really set the tone for the video. I love her sm 😂😂
Shayne's Dio is perfect
This was one of the funniest ones so far!
Everyone was amazing but Amanda had me CRYING, she's so hilarious
Damien is by far the worst at playing dead
I think this might be the best one yet! I was laughing out loud the entire time! So good! Love you Damien!
AMANDA FREAKING KILLED ME OML
"Who's in the cloak in..." -hears laughter "Oh it's Shane."
This was awesome. Everyone was just at the top of their games. Dude, Amanda is just so freaking talented. and Rachel also did so well! Keep up the good work everyone!
Shayne as DIO was top tier.
That tea spilled about Kimmy's pool parties. Gulp, gulp, gulp.
I also use my Twitch emotes as work slack emotes LMFAO self promo baby
YES SHANE!!!! bring the jojo!!!!!
I really hope someone ulpoads the BTS, I need more reactions to Shayne's Dio!
I could barely breathe throughout the entire thing 😂
Also how is Amanda’s agent character just Nicholas Cage
Amanda and Shayne are so consistently hilarious!
Shayne is DIO is fucking great and Spencer killed it like usual
i think i just lost 5 pounds of visceral abdominal fat halfway through the video from how hot this roast got!
Damn. DIO’s a lot shorter in real life
Good job on having Nicolas Cage on this one haha who knew he was Damien's agent
Dude y’all WENT for him 😂😂😂😂
I’m 1/8 of the audience
Holy shit Olivia's virtue signaling joke has me screaming
Tommy's laugh is absolutely contagious.
I think that might have been the funniest Olivia has ever been. That was incredible. Everyone brought it
im part of the 1/8th of the audience that enjoyed that
Let's all continue to say what we will about Olivia.
Shayne as Dio made me laugh so hard that hurts xD and the "Goodbye Damien" was just perfect
please tell me someone else noticed how warped Spenser's face looks in that framed picture on the floor
HOly fucking shit, they went HARD
Amanda is absolutely incredible
Holy. Crap. Truly hollering at EVERYONE in the video. Shayne as Dio, Amanda as the overworked agent, Olivia as Augustus, EVERYONE! Thank you for another great funeral video.
What a BRUTAL roast. I loved it
Olivia dissing Damien right after Rachel said he stole her style... x)
I'm actually jealous of Damien having an awesome friend like Shayne! The prep he had to do must've been insane!
This one was was a complete homerun from start to finish. Everyone had killer material and the characters were everything. Couldn't stop laughing and I definitely replayed multiple parts 🤣 Also special shout out to the video description of "Resident anime fan dies, not very uwu of him." 👍🏼
I loved this so much, you guys are awesome. Thanks for the laughs!
Aquafina bottle with Dasani insides DESTROYED this whole roast - 100/10
Why were there so many jokes on ASD
I'm only 4 minutes in and Rachel was amazing  EDIT: Everyone was hilarious again no surprise
I would do anything for Damien 🥵
This was the best one yet
16:14 YO I play Fire Emblem Heros and when I heard Amanda said Fire Emblem and pointed at the picture of Shez, I instantly opened the game and saw his name as the voice and heard his character quotes. HOLY SHIT!
You were expecting Shayne Topp... BUT IT WAS ME, DIO
Damn Rachel went all in with a critical hit, I love it
Anyone else hear someone from the crew at 15:52 speaking into a mic saying “oh my god” lolololol
Wait wait I just found out Damie voiced DENNIS from Fortnite in Save The World mode? THAT DENNIS???  Dude.
Damn this one was the BEST
Might’ve been the best funeral video yet
Shayne is honestly such a good actor
I don't get in the blink of both eyes realy hard joke
omg Spencer's whole bit gave me a headache cause the oxygen got cut off from my brain from me laughing at everything
I’m honestly surprised Damien even did this considering how soft he is lol
Was a bit uncomfortable with Spencer jokes as a queer person ngl, Kind sounded less like a roast and more like making fun of lgbt+ idk
Oh finally! I’ve been waiting for this one since this series started!
shane looks amazing as Dio damn
It was amazing and soooo funny until the last 2 open their mouth (ruined the vid)
Haven’t done a Shayne Died joke in a while
Amanda ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10🔥
I wish Damien would have atleast pretended to close his eyes during this, I'm not sure why but I'm upset that he didn't 🥲😂
Spencer's roast is 🔥🔥🔥
This was the best fucking one
SMOSH GAVE US WHAT WE ALL WANTED!!!! FINALLY!!!
he made the jojo reference
I really need to see one of these for Spencer
I have been waiting for this sins that started this show. HOLY SHIT so funny <3 loved Damien took it like a champ and the hole cast roasting was godlike. Shaynes DIO Cosplay was the best thing i have ever seen LMAO
My god Shane DIO was not on my weekly bingo card 😂
I mean this in the best way possible... he FINALLY died. Been waiting for this :D
I have never been more attracted to Shayne 😩
FINALLY THEYVE DONE DAMIEN
Honestly, this is one of the best roasts you guys have done! Laughing all the way through 😂
Spencer is the reason this video should exist  Edit: Also Shayne
This was an absolute slaughter from start to finish, holy hell Smosh. 100/10 👏  👏
Stop! Damien is already dead! You don't have to murder him this hard! xD seriously guys, I had a very good time laughing at all the roasts. Everyone was so funny
Damien KILLED it at the end
Fuck it's actually insane that this might be the best one yet because there's been a lot of these now. Well frickin' done.
They went HARD on Damien. But dude took it like a kink
I think this has been the best roast yet!! Shane as Dio killed me 🤣
Dio Shayne is now one of my favorite personas ever
This is so savage, nobody hold back, love it!!!
911 yes hello shayne is too hot to be left alive
I'm in the eight of the audience! I LOVE IT
you could've just titled it Damien Haas dieed
Really thought DIO shayne was going to end it with a classic 'You need more training'
Shane as DIO is the best thing EVER
we need more of dio shayne
“I’m sorry if that came off abrupt, I’m autistic and also a bitch” Rachel coming in hot with an instant all-timer
YAAAAAAASSSSSSS
Shane as Dio saying squishy squishy got me 😂😂😂
The best funeral video i have ever seen so far. 🤣🤣
I thought I was straight but then I saw Shayne dressed as Dio.
Repping that 1/8th of an audience
Shayne as Dio is beautiful. 18:10
Meta moment: I’m eating Auntie Anne’s pretzels as Augustus complains about the lack of.
Spencer cremated him 💀
holy shit shayne killed it
Hahaha Shayne's poses that was great haha
Easily the best Funeral Roast by far.
Damien just confused how Olivia is a better Agustus... She's really good as Your Mental Illness too. Olivia needs to make a Chaos character cause she can rock them.
Good news Damien. I'm part of the 1/8th.
I haven't even finished the whole video and I'm rewinding Spencer's part 🤣🤣🤣  he came with straight up FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
By far, my favorite funeral
Finally, my favorite smosh actor got his funeral 😌🎉🎉
This was SOO GOOD 😭 Fave funeral by far
Here from Shayne's post tbh
Olivia's character work is stellar
amanda and Shane were top-knotch brlliant
0:55 as an autistic person myself, I felt that on a personal level.
I just noticed that the funeral music is "Happy Birthday", yeah? Lol
After Rachel walking up to the podium, Damien threw in the towel of “guy who is supposed to act dead” haha he was alive and facially emotion filled the whole time 😂
I could see ashes on the screen from how brutally y’all roasted him. I love Damien so much 💖 Been looking forward to this one for a while.
20:14 “About an eighth of our audience is gonna love that.”  Damien. It’s JoJo’s. The WHOLE internet is going to love that. I will also now refer to Shayne Topp’s DIO persona as TOP.
Shayne's Dio is a little too perfect. I love this so much
This funeral needed more Kimiko
You thought it was Shayne…but it was me, Dio!
Great roast, an excellent first performance by Rachel!  P.S.: Anybody else was also kinda hoping Kimiko would show up as the guest? I knew it was unlikely but that it would have been awesome no one can deny.
Shayne's Anime Poses has work
crazy how hes supposed to be dead but doesnt close his eyes ever
Definitely one of the best episodes 🤣
the dio impersonation is top notch and absolutely fucking hilarious! 😂
I know this was all in good fun and Damien was a great sport, but it sounds like Damien has actually voiced how certain things made him feel in the office, like the lights and loud noises, and I think that's honestly really brave :) I have autism, and thankfully I work from home, but if I did work in office, I don't think I would have the courage to say something and would just wear my headphones as much as I could, so good job for standing up for yourself, Damien! We love you <3
Can't pick my favorite part, everyone Killed it!
These roasts showcase the very best of the Smosh cast and crew!
I don’t get the rib joke?
glad to see that damien haas come back from the dead to read everyone's comments as not even the sweet release of death could stop his ego and his insatiable hunger for validation from strangers on the internet.
I’m part of the 1/8! 🤣
I normally have videos like this on in the background as I do work but as soon as Shayne came on screen I could not focus on ANYTHING ELSE
What a BIZARRE funeral amirite?! 😏
God damn, I didn't think YouTube allowed videos portraying actual evisceration.
“It’s gatta be blue or purple or both “ me sitting here with both blue and purple hair 😳
Out of all I've seen i feel like this ones my favorite 🤣
Rachel was on FIRE!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 All of them were almost as harsh, but funny AF - best funeral so far. 😁😁
This was supposed to be a roast but they burned him at the stake
Beefy Dio is my new fitness/fashion goal. Lol.
i didn't know shayne was an anime character and just assumed he had genuinely dressed as courtney for once
Further proof that Smosh now exclusively deals in intentionally producing real-life cringe.
I related a little too much on that first bit 😅. Felt attacked but also seen . Very mixed emotions but hilarious the whole way through guys 😭💕 Also Shayne, thank you.
This video is the proof that you should stick to your own cast or crew members to get roasted.
I knew they'd get him eventually but I wasn't expecting to almost get sick from laughing too hard omfg. Favorite funeral video by far!
Dio Shane needs to be a recurring thing
This was the best one yet.
You thought it was Shayne but it was I, Dio!
Shayne is goodest boy. 10/10 😂
Amanda is fucking brilliant.
It feels like everyone dragged him so much harder than the other roasts! 😂😂 they were all so good
HMM
POV this is video you find out Damien voiced Shez. So proud but also see it now
This was the best one yet. I laughed my arse off.
Shayne and Damien roaster each other the way only two best friends could. It was amazing.
I think Spencer is the new Roast Master General bc woooooooow wooooweeeee 🔥🔥🔥
My cheeks hurt from laughing..... 😆😆😆 All of them were solid.... Probably the best roast to date...
The roasts were so brutal, I'm in tears.
Poor Damien got upstaged by Shayne at his own funeral. As eclipsed in death as he was in life.
Audhd ( autistic & adhd) with OCD… also not straight. Love how inclusive Damien is. He’s the friend we all need in our lives. Just a heart of gold
This is honestly one of the funniest roasts. I absolutely love this and Damien. Keep up the great work!
20:26 PLEASE KILL ME
Is...this?  The thing that gets me to finally watch JoJo?
Hands down one of the best ones:  (Wasn't expecting the Kimmy line lol)
Damien is such a beautiful soul💜
This was the roast I've waiting for and it more than lived up to my expectations. Love Damien ❤️
I don't get Tommy's blink joke. Could someone please explain it to me?
Shayne missed out on the chance to say, “You thought it was gonna be Shayne, but it was ME! DIO!”
Shayne + Dio = Courtney xD
omg shayne
Liv strait up savage
Olivia as Augustus is amazing 🤣
Nothing could have prepared me for Rachel to go up there and absolutely destroy it 😂😂
Damien just had to come back with both roasts to the cast and to himself. Deem is the only one strong enough to LITERALLY go to hell and back. Huge respect
Water gun kelly 😂
I always think everyone is so savage and then TOMMY just destroys everyone
I wish Shayne said, "It was me Dio all along!"
Another banger. Another banger by Dio Brandon from Smosh's Bizzare Adventures
I never realized that Augustus would be the perfect character for Olivia lmao
"I specifically asked to be buried with my Keyblades" Honestly goals.
We'd hire Damien's voice acting agent
I have never felt so roasted for someone on this channel like... usually I just laugh but this one??? OOF. I felt that
Yep. New favorite. You all rocked it on the character work. Damien got some great ones in at the end. Had a great time watching.
Shayne’s Dio poses and quotes were on point! I’m laughing at the top of my lungs 🤣
it makes me smile every time I think about the fact that shane put on a cloak and stayed hidden for like 60% of the vid just for a "IT WAS ME DIO!!" bit like THIS IS THE TYPE OF DEDICATION THAT MAKE ME LOVE THIS CHANNEL
Best episode yet. A banger amongstst bangers.
First line of the roast and Rachel already wins 😂
I know these are supposed to be jokes, but a lot of these felt borderline mean compared to other roasts. I hope Damien isn't too bothered by them.
they really gutted him in this🤣🤣🤣
Shane’s diversity jokes are insane…wtf…I almost choked to death
Please let Kieth be on the next roast
God damn I wish Dio would show up at my funeral like that lmao
"What the fuck are the muscles for soft hands you've never had to fight for anything a day in your life." HOLY FUCK
Amanda . . . un-f***ing-believable , , , ,
This was absolutely hilarious!
"Probably because he fired all of his white blood cells for not being diverse enough." I had to pause the video.
ngl Dio Shayne can get it
Dio shayne was one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen
Water Gun Kelly is an AMAZING joke
What was Spencer promoted to?
This might be the best one..... <3
That's HARD!!
Damn, Olivia went hard on this one
Great job to everyone who featured/worked on this episode, this is the best one yet!
Damn can we talk about how sexy Amanda is as trashy workaholic.
Wow, Shayne as Dio and his jokes were fire. Really loved Amanda's bit too. Dang.
It’s these kinds of videos where you can like it before even watching the video
Damien foreshadowed this
Always love seeing a long video
Good god, they went hard on this one. Holy shit.
Is Damien super woke or something?
Shayne as Dio and referring to Damien as his anime brother really is a full circle moment, I’m sure hey never would’ve seen them making this content back in the so random days, w Matthew Scott showing up just being the icing on the cake
LOVE how long this video is, i wish the previous funerals had been extended as well
Of course he's wearing the kingdom hearts shirt 👌
Easily one of Shayne's greatest performances of all time
"Say what you want about Olivia" lmaooo
Can we get Keith next or Amanda
Olivia as Augustus was perfect 😂
It's about damn time.
Why does Matthew look like soft spoken Eminem its Great XD
Rachel was soo funny 😂
Me: DIO Shayne can’t hurt me, he’s not real DIO Shayne: Hmmmm 🦹‍♂️🦹‍♂️
Shayneeee! No Muda or Wryyyyy. Wasted opportunity!!
wait so that wasnt supposed to be a shane dawson impression
10000% the best roast yet!!!
Shayne had me literally howling in laughter.
DIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOI
Honestly I don't know how Damien is going to recover from this...its a shame because it's super difficult to find a white boy with blue hair who also likes anime
Amando, Shayne, amazing character work, this video kept me laughing all along
Shayne as DIO was the best part of the video hands down
Shayne was amazing in this!!!
I mean this with love but Amanda looks like a muppet in this character..😅 very well done! But the eyes I can’t 😂
Dio shane had me in literal tears
This is … brutal
Shayne missing an opportunity by not being Cloud Strife... the Dio did irreparable damage to my psyche so thank you for that 🥴
this series keeps getting better each episode like WOAH yall are talented
Spencer really is the sleeper hit in all of these roasts. No matter the amount of jokes or time he has they all hit so hard
Shayne is doing way too good of a Job playing DIO. He nailed that shit
That was the funniest shit I've watched in a long time.  Watching Damien's roast was like a dream come true, and I must say that every each of y'all totally delivered. Thatnk you for your service 🥰🤩
omfg I knew he was gonna talk about pool parties or something boat related when he said post pictures of "yall hanging out without me" haha didnt think he'd actually call out Kimmy
Spencer killed it
The harsher they roast, the more they love ya.
damien you are my favorite tumblrina
Dio Shayne was awesome
Shayne segment was incredible
When does the DIO Shayne shirt drop?
This was good. Shayne, with the anime acting hilarious.
jesus, Spencer, that was brutal) the voice over actor joke is just chef kiss
Wow, Shayne manscaped his entire upper body for this! 😆
Dio shayne was so funny I cried
Easily top 2 most brutal and unhinged yet!
Women in stim 😩😭😂 TOMMY
As a POCH, we will surely miss the influence of our dear Watergun Kelly
A smosh roast as it should be. Unhinged, no holding back and everybody genuinely looks like they’re having the time of their life
Damien's comment about Kimmy's pool parties was hilarious. I always wonder where he is on their Insta stories.
We love you Damien!
I think this is the funniest one yet 😂 Brutal but in the best way possible.
Been waiting for this since Shane's Roast. So excited.
Lmfao absolutely roasted, murdered and demolished.
I like how it wasn't Dio roasting Damien but it was Shayne using Dio's persona to roast Damien. That made it more hilarious.
Damn it that was so good xD
Damien does seem like the kind of person to get invited to an event, making up an excuse to not go, and then be angry that the rest post pictures without him.
Everybody ripped Damien apart... I loved every second of it.
My god this one was kinda brutal 🤣
matthews part was weak as fuck. the rest were awesome, especially shane as dio
who is sitting there shane or courtney...
Why does he keep getting up
Water gun Kelly was actually so good 😂
I’ve been waiting for this one!
i was me! Shane!
Amanda is literally killing all the new characters and expressions lately, just bang on, so freaking funny 🤣
This roast was brutal! Omg, Damien took it like a champ.
ive been waiting for Damien to die! Now is my chance to slide into Shayne's DMs as his new BF!
20:16 Yes, I loved that LMAO
This shit funny as hell boi
Kono Shayne Da
Was That A Jojo's Reference?!
That was without a doubt the best one yet!
Someone draw Dio Shayne RIGHT NOW!!!
Spencer is funny , I miss courtney in director info.
shane is looking like courtney
Wowowowwww this is brutal! Amazing!
This one’s in the top 3 for sure. Great funeral episode.
The best roast so far
Some of these were just hateful and I’m here for it. Lol
olivia fucking killed that jesus christ
I feel like they turned the savage up to 11 for damien lol
damien not being able to keep his eyes closed
Wryyyy
I think Augustus is Olivia’s character now
Man they went so hard at the start, like cobra kai no mercy. Kind of softened by the end, but definitely a good one.
So long-awaited I can't wait to watch after work!
Just started this, can only hope there's a "Damien haas passed away" joke here.  edit: there wasn't, but still good bits all around. Shayne especially.
Spencer next plz!!
295 <3
This episode went visceral   👍
This was fuckin B R U T A L XD
! ! KUDOS ! ! From Canada. Good Stuff. No Courtney though , hmm
Olivia and I had the same face the entire time. Wtf did I just watch
It’s a good thing Damien is dead, because they were all actively trying to murder him.
Tommy!!!! Ahhhh!!! I’m dead
That intro only was splendid! lol
This is probably one of my favourite funerals so far lmao
All of the autism/neurodivergent jokes have me cackling
Shane as DIO is perfection.
This is a masterpiece
Shayne' s Dio is incredible, the little gestures and everything, 10/10.
That Dio impression was better than I believed any live-action Dio could possibly be.
Sweet Damien! I know he was very anxious for this! But it was a fantastic video!
I've been waiting to watch this. Finally. Thank you 🙂👍
Yo there’s some major hostility I’m not having fun anymore
WHAHAHA this one went hard
This is one of the funniest roasts you all have done in a minute. I've had bad couple of days mentally (and this is relevant because it's Damien's roast), but this made me laugh out loud so many times. 10/10 guys
The eighth did LOVE that
Following up Shayne's joke, I'm expecting Dio Shayne merch in the store within a week
DIO Shayne got me actin up
Damn.... love this sooo much
Shayne finished his bit so I had a moment to breath & drink water. Unfortunately before I managed to swallow Tommy came & gave his opening. Water went everywhere!
"Water Gun Kelly" 💀
In my opinion this it the worst one in the series at least in the other ones they stayed dead most of the time not in this one it looked like Damien was awake most of the time  I really don't want to sound rude but I don't get why u did a Damien onecin the first place he's least funniest out of all the members of smosh but again this is just my opinion
Amanda Needs A Movie. also, over all, this was a masterpiece. Smosh should just stop and change into the new Celebrity Roast.
Dude, the cast went NUCLEAR on this! Holy crap!
They haven’t laughed this hard since the Rhett and Link funeral
That was so funny! I can't wait for the next one these are so good!
Dio Shayne WAS EVERYTHIING!! HAHAHAHA
Good lord, a 40 minute and detailed roast 💀 But I feel like that just proves how much they like each other
YESSSS SHAYNE
HOLY HELL! This was so much better than I thought it would be! Rachel came so hard to start and it only went up from there 🤣 As always, Amanda’s ability to create and remain in character amazes me. Well done!
I wanted 10 more people on this roast this was hilarious and I've been waiting for the Damien funeral vid forever!!! 💗
Dio Shayne could have said anything with those poses and it would have been just as good, my goodness
Rachel 👑
I like to call these style of roasts cremations bc you roast a dead body
I’ve been waiting for this one 😂
This was quite the roast. Been waiting for this one since they started doing funerals. I’d say it was the best one yet!   They all did such a great job.
Roasts so brutal it turned Damien tan.    Kidding aside, this truly is one of the most brutal roasts. No one held back and delivered the best with what they have. Even the cosplays slapped with Augustus, Dio and the voice agent.
Damien forgetting he’s supposed to be dead
I would be in that coffin for Dio Shayne
shayne dio was surprisingly good.
As someone who just recently started following the live feeds Rachel has been running in prep for UTM I just gotta say, she is incredible and her bit in this roast was really funny and as a fellow Autist it made me feel seen!
this might be the best funeral roast yet, everybody was on their A-game lol
This was the best one yet 😳😳😳
Yesssss it’s here!!! I love Damian, I’ve been so psyched for his roast it’s insane!
Tommy killed it💀💀💀
This was the meanest and most brutal one yet. Absolutely magnificent.
The next one of these should be "The Death of Courtney Freekin Miller" Cuz Shayne didn't get a chance to roast people back.
Jesus Christ this was the most brutal roast yet. Everyone definitely stepped up their game to roast Damien. Rachel and Olivia as Augustus were by far the MVPs of this roast. Nicely done everyone!
Just finished it Live, amazing. Thanks for popping in Damien, always love these roast.
Also, Rachel cleared all jokes with me first. We’re homies. Protect her at all costs.
This was absolutely the most savage roast so far 🤣🤣
Dio forgot to scream The World
Comment
spencer had me cry laughing holy shit
That was… Gold 😂😂😂
Damien’s facial expressions throughout this are everything😂
Omg this is one of the best roast funerals EVER
Purgatory made me more savage than you ever thought possible.
Damien really came back from the dead to turn this into a Red Funeral situation holy shit my guy.
This was so good!
Best
The Saxophone Guy 36:19
OMG spencer
Iam one of the 1/8
This was insane. Good job.
Is that a JOJO REFERENCE????
I just came here to see Shane's performance 🤓
I'm one of damien's twitch subscribers and I think that made the jokes like 10 times funnier because they also roasted literally everyone in his twitch community
I love how both damien and olivia play augustus perfectly
OMG Shayne this was amazing
WOW!! You ALL brought your A game to this roast! Sooooo funny!!! I love!
Shayne looks like Courtney's buff twin sister
🐿️
i love the jojo references, Dio Shayne was a pretty good impresion
Should've ended with Tommy
This was BRUTAL 😂
Shayne as Dio is just Courtney 😂😂
They really just put up a picture of Shez from Fire Emblem Three Hopes and called it a day, huh?  Kinda love that, actually.  Edit: WAIT FUCK HE ACTUALLY WAS SHEZ FROM FIRE EMBLEM THREE HOPES
right I know damien isn't really dead but fuck me surely spencer just absolutely murdered him in cold blood
This is the best funeral smosh has done yet!!! Omg that was hilarious
Damien’s funeral might be one of the funniest yet, I love his deep breathing as he readies for whatever the fuck Shayne has coming 🤣
OMG YESSSSSSS
I cried with Amanda's performance, so good. Also everyone here was so good, Damien is loved by them all
There is no more Damien - Only the Haas and Haas nots
What happened to shaynes rib
Noooo not my poor Damien!! 😭😭 but that intro gee Rachel 🤣
Shayne proving that he’s an actor, above all
Oh my god you came for him!
The virtue signaling got me😂😂
Spencer kiiiiiiiiillllllled
i am SCREAMING. this is easily one of the BEST smosh funeral videos💀
Damien can't even act like he is dead lol
Rachel’s autism jokes had me DYING 😂
I can die happy now
Shayne as Dio omg xD <3
THIS EPISODE IS SO FUNNY
Finally. I’ve been waiting for Damien to die for so long.
I literally laughed so hard I started coughing and nearly puked. This is the best one ever.
this was so good and so bad and too far and not far enough. i wish they went this hard on everyone for real
This was BRUTAL. Damn.
Shayne as DIO is perfect. XD
Is it just me or was Amanda's energy channeling a bit of Farley's Matt Foley (living in a van down by the river) character?
OMFG I love Rachel!
Amanda is such a talented character actress, every time she’s on I’m absolutely enamoured. Also Spencer was absolutely scathing, everyone was so funny in the episode. Shayne’s Dio is just if Courtney was a man
FINALLY
SPENCER'S ROAST WAS GOD TIER
OMG Amanda. How is she not a movie star?
Dude Spencer killed it.
I appreciate Amanda accidentally cosplaying as Ted Mosby
I WAS CACKLING THROUGH SPENCER'S ENTIRE ROAST HELP???
Good bye jojo….. I mean Damien
Spencer brought 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Spencer was fucking savage lmao
You thoug Im Shayne Topp  BUT IT WAS ME, DIO!!!!
Epic! Really enjoyed this!😆😆
neat.
Gonna go out on a limb and say that was the most cohesive thing Olivia has ever done
Olivia come to play
oh my god rachel is absolutely BRILLIANT
Speaking as someone with aspergers, Rachel’s autism jokes are fucking golden.
Not Cracker Barrel Jon hamm
RACHEL KILLED IT
i love rachel so much holy shit
Calling it now, "you thought it was Shayne BUT IT'S ME, DIO!"
“I’m autistic and also a bitch.” LMAOOO
"I'm autistic and also a bitch"
Do Keith next
Heartless shirt, out the gate. Legendary
Get ready for some  Anime  Depression Emo Voice acting jokes
4 more minutess, when i commented this. cant wait
Holy stramboney was that a jojo reference(joke).
I wonder who will inherit Kimiko. I'd volunteer but I don't have blue hair....
Haunt me Damien senpai... uwu
Kono Damien Da!
"You thought it was Shayne who would read at Damien's funeral? Too bad! It was me, Dio!!!"
Shayne should do a dab in front of Damien a roasting type of one
ahahaha yessss..... Nobody can escape Jojo especially DIO
I never thought I needed to see Shayne as DIO until now
I never thought I was anything but straight but Shane as Dio got me questioning, I mean be was born a  Topp afterall
shayne as dio has me screaming in joy
Fuck my weeby ass i didn't believe we would get here
other : tries hard to close eyes damien : visibly anxious
This is the one I've finally been waiting for
I can't wait to see this man get dragged to hell and back
tbh been waiting for this
Shayne as Dio is peak cosplay🙏🏾
Dama moooo
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
DIO!!!!!

Shane cosplaying as Dio. I cannot wait for this!
My birthday is tomorrow, December 12. This is gonna be a great present from Smosh.🎂
Dio?
Finally, I've been waiting for Damien's funeral for way too long
Shayne as a Dio really look alike Courtney🤣
I wonder if there will be any surprise guests for this one 🤔😮😋
This video is awesome.
DIOOOOOOO
shayne looks absolutely amazing as DIO
AAAAHHHAAAHAH DIOOO
I cant even imagine what Shayne will do or say, like, hes gonna scream WRYYY as a douchebag, or use another dead ass JoJo meme, like, WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW?
Shayne if officially using the best makeup smosh ever made
Don't forget, it's bad manners to laugh at someone's funeral. 🤭
It must be funny for people, who haven't watched this format before, how comments under the video titled "Damien is dead" are all like yeaaah finally! Can't wait to see this, benn waiting for this for sooo long!  P.s Shayne fits Dio character so well that I'd actually believe that Dio exists and he is Shayne
First
You were expecting Shayne! But it was I, DIO!
I can't wait to see this!!!
But why isn’t it Damien Haas Died FOR THE PUN
I need to ready myself because all the roast that might be drop will deal collateral damage to me.
I can’t wait for this!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I’ll be ready
Why does Shayne fit dios look so perfectly.. OH GOD I’m excited
NOT DIO HAHAHA
This could end like Roger’s, from American Dad.
Incoming banger.
Guys, please shut down this channel!
Oh gosh, I cannot wait until noon tomorrow for this.
Please shut this channel down. This is insulting to the legacy of Smosh
hello jojo! wryyyyyy....
🔥🔥🔥
I adore Damien. This will be so funny.
I remember hearing Damien say they just recorded his roast on the Eat it or Yeet it with questions and I've been waiting ever since
21 hours. Why tease me?!
Hey Smosh Can You guys do KIMMY Next Please🙏❤️🎬✍️🌹🌟👑💖
I’m expecting a lot of Shez and Fortnite jokes in this.
Why does Shane look Like Courtney dressed as Shane 😅
You thought it was Shayne Topp.  But it was me, DIO!
You better not mess this one up
I expected something but I didn't expect DIO OF ALL PEOPLE!
DIO
The response roast is gonna be the darkest dark damien we ever did see
I'VE BEEN WAITING AGES FOR THIS ONE YESSSSSS
*WHERE'S ANDY*
Run Ian before they get you too!! 😨 and put you in YT Rewind 2022 like i did
Oh my God! It's the enemy stand user!
I'm on a mission to get Smosh 1M extra subscribers. Guess I may as well abort it because Smosh's content is worthy, classic and hilarious enough ❤️UwU❤️
Dying my hair purple in preparation
OH MY GOD THIS IS GONNA BE INSAAANEEEE
Love Damien
What on Damien’s neck??
I thought Shayne was Courtney at first glance
Shayne was Dio all along?!?!   This explains so much!
Damn, i was SO ready for this video and it's not out yet lmaoo. Heartbroken!
Damn it I don’t want to wait until tomorrow!
Shane and Courtney are slowly morphing into the same person.
I've been waiting for this one for so long, FINALLY, IT FUCKING CAME TRUE. This would be probably more hilarious than the other funeral roasts
omg I thought that was courtney for a second lol
Sad that I'll be at work when this premiers.
This will be the best one I can’t wait
Jojo
JoJo Reference? Must watch it
FINALLY, IVE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM.
Omg seeing Shayne as Dio is too much for my heart right now. Lmao 🤣🤣
What's up with all the thirst trap bots?
yas!
I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS ROAST CUZ I SAW DIO AND OMG
*Damien is FINALLY dead...*        Fandub reference!
Finally! 🤣🤣
...Is that DIO?!
i already know this one will be the harshest roast yet
Shayne as Dio was not how I expected to start my day but here we are.
Dio is here
Shayne cosplaying as DIO made my day. I can die happy now.
How much (if any) communication do each of y'all have with each other for these roasts to make sure you don't use similar jokes as each other?
Hopefully kimiko will appear huhuhu uwu
😂😂😂😂❤️🖤💙💜💕💞✨
This makes me scared but also amazed what everyone is going to come up with for our sweet boy Damien XD He UwU'd till he couldn't no more lol
Please explain to me why Shayne looks like Envy from Full Metal Alchemist…
gonna make some list of anime references here.. welp ofcourse it's damien
Is that fucking DIO?
How much (if any) communication do each of y'all have with each other for these roasts to make sure you don't use similar jokes as each other?
Oh this is gonna be good
I saw DIO and now I have to watch this
