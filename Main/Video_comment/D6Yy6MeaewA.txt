Alex Hall's ratings are always so high, mad sussy
yo the triple grab 16 was crazyyyy score should be higher tho
Harlaut such a lame style. Boomer still thinks boom bap is cool.
The judges in this event were garbage. Alex hall, Evan, Abm, and Henrik were all robbed in their scores. Why?
Petition for steep steep to announce the real stream next year!!!!!!
How did Quinn get invited? I did not expected him in the Big Air...
Woodsy has a unique style that is definitely overlooked.
No vinny cash also hurts my feelings
38 really made sense for that switch dub bio 18
Props to regettli
I love woods so fuckn much but my boy come on give us a 1440
Andri was a machine tonighit
All the ad money from this should 100% go to these athletes but it probably doesn’t
Where is Mike Douglas and Uncle E??
High levels of  dominance.  Greatjob by the ski big air super studs
wolfermans 360 was not a 360
I can‘t understand why they give 18 to antoine when he does 3 grabs
38 for Henrik on what was probably the biggest trick of the night. Good job XGames! Keep being stupid.
The thing about henriks tricks is the axis of them, there's not one other skier that can do those type of tricks that he does and being scored a 42 for a dub bio 1620 and then just a 38 for a switch dub bio 1800 just doesn't sit right. It's not all about doing the most amount of spins since we got aerials for that and style and being unique should play a big part in freesking. i do not however think he should have won but the judging overall in both big air and knuckle huck this year was just strange... Should have been 1Antoine, 2Andri and 3ABM as the podium (in my opinion) , and jesper for the knuckle huck (as said by henrik himself in interviews here in sweden)
Henriks 38 was underscored... but his baggy style has also been robbing others in past slopestyle/big air events. All fair after all, cuz x game IS about Robbing the best runs!
20:15 -> 1980
They need to require a switch hit or spins in both directions because this format is just a giveaway to Ragettli
10:54 BOOM!
why on earth would they do this at night with such poor lighting? Half the skiers were wearing black and got washed out by the dark sky. Terrible coverage.
nobody cares about  tiktok
Everyone looked like they were having a bad night except Andri... Henrick should have been scored higher.
Too much talk for a prerecorded event, get on with the event, nobody cares about all the extra bullshit talk,
MERCI   FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION !!!
John 3:16-17 16-For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Harlaut may as well not even wear pants.  Its not 2005 anymore man. Look like an idiot.
Aaron Blunck is still the man.
Henrik was robbed so hard
They're going way tooo hard this year sooo much history in one contest
That landing on the trip 19 was impeccable
geil gmacht, schön für d schwiz!
Tom is such a great caster! Legend
You guys are sooooo talented!! Love to see this type of skiing!
Henrik Harlaut first trick, Dub bio 16 Safety not switch at take off: 42 points  Hes second run: Switch dub bio 18 Safety: 38 points? Like What are the judges doing over there?!
The lack of audience and the tricks looking so similar made this year's big air kinda dull.
Saw people complaining in the medal runs video so came to watch the whole thing myself... the judging doesnt seem that bad to me? Sure harlauts and abms tricks were super sick and deserved a few more points but overall I think ragettli and adelisse were a clear 1st and 2nd with huge spins that were very steezy as well. Like how are you gonna say that ragettlis 19 was just spin to win when that mute was tweaked to the moon?! And adelisse with the triple grab and pre nose showed so much style as well, honestly cant really see where theres any argument that freeskiing is getting boring/not steezy
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I never understand how they can jump so high and land without there legs buckling or something like that. I mean if I jumped off my roof which is about the same height by the looks of it, I'd break my legs
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
wutang forever 👐🏼
Repent of your sins and turn to God
Sports were good back when crowds could attend.
Disappointed nobody did a 2520. No, but seriously, can big air go any further or has it maxed out now?
do one x games with computer judges
Can someone explain to me how the time (top left) and the amount of runs work in this contest?
HOPE  🏅⛷ Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John  🙂 ❤️🤍💙  🏅⛷❄️
no ski poles for first place raggetli? olympic aerials quad full quad twist next.
That’s sick, it’s looks like butter the way they slay the slope!!!!
No one talking about the insane dub 16 👃 from alex????
In my opinion Andri improved his style alot from almost only doing the huge spin spread eagle safety grab tricks in the past, definitely a deserved win here
43 for a trip with 3 grabs?? Come on...
Crazy performance from Andri, pushing the sport forwards!
lol who paid off the judges for this sesh
What about harlaut sw 1800? Judge gave the scores pretty low ...
🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🤙🏻
Alex Beaulieu-Marchand done the most interesting and complex tricks! Switch to switch, two grabs in the air - and then he got 18 for that trick. Unfair!
Antoinnes triple grab should have been a 48 imo
Good to see Andri crashing on his final jump. I was starting to think that he's some kind of skiing cyborg who just lands every ridiculous trick like it's nothing.
Henrikkkk
34:33 lead octo to trailing octo
What happened to Birk?
Song at 7:17 and 30:00 ? Thanks
Misteki Spaghetti boring spin skiier
Abms 45 was just disrespectful. Should have been higher.
ABM GOT ROBBED!
Harlaut wins the style
12:45 He jynxed the man hard! haha
i'm henrick fan but a big GG to the winner!
Shoutout to Alex Schlopy for the 1980 attempts in 2013, someone finally landed it
My phone died with 2 mins left and I nearly cried
This is sad to say but I feel like harlaut isn’t in his prime any more and won’t get another gold 😔😔
What’s the song at 46:05?
3 score i didnt agree,  2xbio1800 should have been 44ish Triple with triple grab was insane, at leadt 46 Triple front was also sick, should be more then 31, takes ball to do that
Wolf Missoula, Montana represent🤘 406
I don’t know what it was but this year just wasn’t the same. It wasn’t nearly as entertaining. You can even hear the lack of enthusiasm in the casters’ voices.
That Wendy’s promo was awkwardly long
Anyone know the name of the artist from that song that is playing at 30:21 - 30:37 , “They don’t understand I’m a mad man trying to get it.”
This ski big air definitely made history tonight. Felt like the skiers where pushing into the new boundary's and leaving the 2020 ski tricks behind and pushing to new levels. Watching this event kinda threw me off though. No skier can now do a steezy trick thats still very hard and be scored high its all spin to win. yes progression is great but I feel like its just not cool anymore and our levels have been maxed out.Goodbye to steezy creations and hello 1800 degree spins. And it wouldn't be an x games without whack judging but hey well done to the robots hope edollo keeps it real and still does his thing and shout out to Quinn for that triple front flip sorry mate but if andri had done that it would of scored a 50
I really enjoyed the 7 unskippable USAA ads tho
i wish this was a switch cork 7 contest :( spin to win. Remember when Simon hit that dub front that was so epic haha.
Henriks tricks are sick but they dont seem that technical or impressive, at least maybe when we have people doing triples.
Teaching skiing all day today, come home to watch more skiing.
At 24:28 even Todd Walnuts the pretzel man was confused henrik scored so low
quinn with the triple front flip throwback to slvsh?
I think Andri deserved the win but some of the scoring was wack. Antoine's triple grab 43 should be higher.
👌🔥
🇧🇷🇧🇷
Let's go Andri!!!!!!!  Sick
Harlaut got 38 for a worlds first, thats a joke!
Henrik got robbed smh
I was never notified :'( my heart's broken ugh 💔
Henrik did the same 2 tricks like the whole time and didn’t do any triples. Was spin to win. Felt like it was weird comp for him and I think he can def do better. Congrats to Andri. wutang 4 life 👐🏼
Forgetti spaghetti!
Wu forever!!
WUTANG IS FOR THE CHILDREN
ar ar ar ar!!!! harlaut ftw always
