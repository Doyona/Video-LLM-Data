Need to do chocolate pop it's again!!  This came up just now ❤ obviously I'm going to re watch a jazzy vid! I put mini marshmallows, smarties, mini eggs, all sorts aha ❤
I like how the smarties are all wibbly wobbly it plays tricks on your eyes and makes it look all bumpy and cool
I feel like the pickle covered in Cheeto crumbs would actually be good if you like pickles
Ketchup flavored Cheetos?!
That was so much damn honey
I LOVE CADBURY BUT I MISS GALAXY COOKIE CRUMBLE, it was the ONLY galaxy chocolate I would eat😭😭💔
ساس
7:26 That face lol 14:37-14:41 SO SATISFYING! <3 17:18 OMG LOVE IT!!! 18:49 Taking that glob and dropping it in some nice hot tea would be lovely <3
I was momentarily confused with the smarties. I am familiar with sugary disc like Smarties.
The oreos balls my Aunt makes every Christmas with papermaking candy in them and it's really good!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GRAPES D:
I love eating just plain frozen grapes as a snack. No need for the other stuff
put the pops in the freezer and the chocolate will harden as soon as it hits the balls
Very interesting video
Team dairy milk
We don't have galaxy chocolate where I live in Australia
My name is Daisy am a. Big fan
My dad taught me for the summer that green frozen grapes are amazing and that what I still do after years of him being gone green grapes frozen is my summer thing
Always galaxy creamy goodness ❤
So smarties are like tart in the usa so is it like sweet there
Me instead of baking the garlic I would just go and buy garlic paste 😋 it's basically the same thing 🙃
That silicon is unlikely to be food safe. You really shouldn't use things that aren't they can be carcinogenic if you ingest some which is possible if you cook with them.
im sorry... KETCHUP FLAVORED CHEETOS????
Your ignorance is bliss shirt reminds me of yohio and I love it
The best pickles are the baby dills with tons of bumps all over them. The bumps make them super crunchy and delicious.
You got ketchup Cheetos 🤣🤣EWWWWWWW
I’m in the UK you can usually find hot Cheetos in the garage but usually come in small bags or down the local corner shop
Video is very nice
amazing
It’s parsley you usually put on garlic bread not basil 😅
Ketchup Cheetos instead of flaming hot. The UK has been robbed.
Hi
I'm dying at your Alexa interrupting you 🤣🤣🤣
I'm not sure that's enough put more in! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😍🤔👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I think you're supposed to drain the pickle juice and then soak the pickles and eat them he pickles😂
Apparently Soft Cheese is "cream cheese" 😁. LOVE the smartie chocolate popper!! So happy you colour co-ordinated the Smarties 😁
You need an offset spatula to do the spreading.
Yup. Cream Cheese. Soft cheese could be a lot of things?
The US is the only place that measures butter in sticks. Never seen it in Canada. We go by portions of a cup, because yah...I haven't really translated to metric very well when it comes to baking, as most recipes are using US measurements.
I just freeze the grapes on their own, no added sugars or coatings and they taste grrrrrreat!
Could you please do amazon/ inexpensive  place try on haul of winter lounge/ workout sets?
i hope you answer. Did you put the chocolate pop it in the fridge or freezer?
Honey haunts me since I got food poisoning from it last weekend 😅😅
You should revisit the "Pregnant for 24 Hours Challenge"  and do a bigger belly and try on different outfits.  Maybe do a twin belly?  Loved your last pregnant challenge video!
Note, if a jar won't open just bang the lid on a hard surface a few times, nothing too hard. It will pop right off!
when you was squeezing the garlic looked like you was squeezing someones spots xxxx
You should try Norwegian chocolate. Thats the best chocolate 🥺🥰
Says galaxy is the superior chocolate while I’m currently eating dairy milk
I call it cream cheese and I’m from the uk I also can usually buy it off the shelf as cream cheese
Who’s been eating apples by the toaster? 🤣
Tip for cake pops: dip the sticks in chocolate first and putting the balls in  the freezer before you dip them, helps the chocolate set faster and giving a better finish. 😉
If you fancy making the garlic bread again, try using parsley instead of the basil! 😊
Wait, Smarties are not the same in the UK as they are in the US? are they chocolate?
If you run your hands on stainless steel after touching garlic, it neutralises the smell on your skin.
As soon as you said you were gonna do the one where you soak the crisps in the pickle juice I just thought WHY would anyone CHOOSE to eat soggy wotsits
We’ve been making “Oreo balls” for years. We call them Moose Turds and we put them on pretzel sticks. They are delicious
Ur meant to chop a slice of pickle then crunch the crisp snd dip the pickle in it
Plain frozen grapes are the best! Stick a toothpick in each grape before you freeze them, then you can suck on them like a lollipop until they thaw enough to chew!
Gaxlicy is the best tho
Just frozen grapes on their own no powder are amazing just the right sweetness and also like an icepole texture xx
Galaxy is the best sorry and the galaxy hot chocolate is the best
Love this video 😍
Anyone know where her shirt is from?
For the frozen grapes they work the best if you use lemon either lemon juice or a lemonThen coat with the Jell-O and put in the freezer they’re my fave 💖
Am I the only person on earth who hates Oreos? I don't mind Bourbons at a push but I'd have to be forced to eat Oreos.
👍
Hi jazz, I love your videos so so much and I love your bubbley personality, I wish you and nick the best. 🙂
What is your blender
I’ve tried the jelly grapes and you put wayyyyyyyyyyy to much on. You need a light dusting and their delicious 😋
Galaxy  best by far lol xxx
I'm not on tik tok, but surely pouring a liquid on crisps is a prank. There is no way any crisps wouldn't dissolve.
If you do a whole punnet of grapes and 1 sachet of jelly that would be better x
“what a game” reminds me of the show miranda. literally so many things jazzy says reminds me of that show and i love it lmao. galaxy is also elite <3 ALSO YOU NEED TO TRY THE PICKLED GARLIC TREND
Jazzy : “I like sweet thing but that’s too sweet for me” Meanwhile the grapes r drenched in salt
"this looks incredible" (garlic bread) Me:- cuz it looks like BTS sign 😂💜
Fyi your not supposed to SOAK the chips in pickle juice,….you just pour a little on top! Lol of course they will be soggy,that’s funny!
I always buy flaming hot cheetos from my local asda or tesco as there my kids favourite x
ketchup cheetos sounds absolutely awful. Flaming hot limon cheetos is where its at.
My mom has been making Oreo truffles just like those for years!! They’re always a hit and I personally like them with either milk or dark chocolate coating!!
But I can only find flaming hot cheetos?! I can’t find any others😂
Cream cheese is the soft cheese that you make cheesecake out of. I don't know if "Soft cheese" is what the US calls Cream cheese, but it would be whatever you would grab if you wanted to make cheesecake
Im from the uk and call it cream cheese :) everyone I know also does haha
You probably didn’t like the garlic bread because it was roasted. Fresh garlic has much more of a spicy bite whereas roasted is much sweeter and has a “softer” flavour 😄
Cracks me up. People have been roasting garlic in the oven forever and suddenly tiktok users think it's something new.
2:40 “I don’t know, don’t look at me” 😂😂 My confidence when trying to give advice to someone,
Galaxy chocolate gives me a headache
I used to think Galaxy was the best until I ate some straight after some dairy milk... now I can't eat galaxy because it tastes so foul to me! Dairy milk all the way! 😂
Does Jazzy remind you of pheromone from friends or is that just me :)
“i used to eat honey because I wanted to be winnie the pooh” HAHAHAHAHHA I DIED🤣
The way the garlic comes out really makes me feel uneasy
I wish I could try Galaxy chocolate 🍫 😔  (From Sweden)
I loved Galaxy as a kid, but as an adult I cannot find it anywhere locally!!! I'm sure somewhere in Australia sells it, so i'm gonna have to do some hunting
philidelphia cheese is Cream cheese, sorry americans, I can't spell Phillie properly, So shoot me, I've said I'm  SORRY
like
So I looked up Galaxy chocolate because Jazzy loves it and found out it's Dove chocolate in the U.S.!
You are so fun !  And fearless. I love the way you just go for it!  Amazing chocolate bar. We don't have those giant Galaxy bars here. They look awesome. Cheers from Canada 🇨🇦
HAHAHHA WHEN THE CHEETO DROPPED INTO JAZZYS MOUTH AND SHS WASNT READY
🤣🤣🤣🤣The sound you made while eating the honey... after you said "Oh my goodness" and coughed. The "Ugh ah uuuuuggghhhh" made me shoot my drink through my nose. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jazzy: maybe something I don’t know don’t look at me  Me: stare at her doing hack lmao
I make the oreo balls every holiday.... SO GOOD!! We call them oero truffles, because they ARE so sweet.
I just freeze grapes without the coating
i am gonna have to try the pop it chocolate thing cause that looks awesome!
excuse me, ketchup flavored Cheetos?!
You poor girl.
Butter by volume   Butter by weight       Quantity in sticks 1 stick of butter     ¼ lb (4 oz) / 115 g	½ cup /125 ml
Those oreo balls are soooooooo good!!!!
When you said you were using smarties, I was thinking ew why but then I realized that smarties where I am, the US, are not chocolate while yours guys are!
Why didn't you eat the bit that came off the popper chocolate!!?? 😂😂
Trending!! Go girl 💕
The garlic squeezing is like Dr Pimple popper
Forgive me because I’m from the U.S, but KETCHUP FLAVORED CHEETOS?? That sounds more American than British, but ok lol
I think your pickles are way different than American pickles. Our juice is green. Yours seemß very clear. That may affect the hack.
Frozen grapes are amazing by themselves. They've been one of my favorite snacks ever since I was a tiny kid. I can't imagine ruining them with sugar!
One stick of butter is 8 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 of a pound, 4oz or, 12 teaspoons.
Just dip in pickle juice! Or do the coating
Jazz you should try just frozen grapes without the jello coating. When I was growing up that was our summer sweet snack. The red grapes are the best but, if you can find green grapes that are slightly yellow then those are amazing also. We also have cotton candy grapes here in America and they are amazing frozen also! Grapes are nature's candy they definitely don't need more sweetness lol!
It was so satisfying to my OCD to see you color coordinate your smarties for the chocolate pop bar.  I can't eat handfuls of M&Ms (I think they are the same as smarties in the UK) like other people....I pour them onto a napkin or plate and sort the colors...I eat the color with the fewest first and work my way up in the number.  I might be a little over the top OCD.  I love your videos!  And we need a shirt that says "Mistakes have been made"....lol.
Hi
That color coordinated pop it is soooo satisfying!
I think people use 1 packet of jello for a whole bag of grapes. Lol you put wayyyy too much.
Where can I get the mould she used for the chocolate n smarties :(
try the crispy pasta  lots of love xxxx
Our family have always been big fans of frozen corn kernels. Great summer snack! Just get the packet out, pour a bit into a bowl, and munch away as they defrost. It sounds weird and maybe even a bit gross, which is exactly what I thought when I was told about it, but once you try it…yum. I don’t like super sweet things either, so sweet corn kernels are perfectly sweet enough for me!
My stepmom makes Oreo balls every year for Christmas, and the are rich. I can never eat more than one at a time. But they are so delicious!🥰💜🍫
oh please try the deep fat fried pasta
Tarragon instead of Basil for the garlic bread, it makes a huge difference in the flavor
oh the Oreo truffles are gorgeous, been making them for years but using light cream cheese makes them a less rich and adding chocolate curls on top instead of crushed Oreo
If you keep the Oreo balls in the fridge, they are much better and will make you eat a whole tray of them😂😂 Been making them for years and they are addictive😂😂
Loooooove the popit choclate, it looks like a fun project to make with kids. ☺️
I can't believe someone can eat so much garlic.... 🤢
Why would anyone soak Cheetos in anything?!
im a galaxy girl!! dairy milk is just not it im sorry !!
Frozen grapes in drinks are good cuz u dont dilute it like with ice🤗.....try pickles and peppermint stick..oranges with hot sauce...bananas with lemon juice...roasted marshmallows with chips(crisp)
this one was one of ur best, it was sooo funny esp the crisp and pickle juice
My first thought upon seeing the smarties was OMG, the mold is color coded! I'm too OCD not to have done the same exact thing LOL
I could eat garlic bread all day and night I love it my 5 year old daughter tried it for first time yesterday she hated it haha 😄
I've never had honey 🍯  I don't like the look of it 🤢
omg i felt sick when you were doing the pickle experiment
My mom always does the same thing with grapes but with a little sugar! I’m hypoglycemic and I dont particularly care for sweets at all so fruits are kind of too much for me but at least they last a long while.
Roasting the garlic mellows the flavor of the garlic.  Most of the garlic bread in the shops id probably done with powdered garlic.
All jars that have a lid if you smack the bottom of the jar 4 to 6 times will loosen the lid to make it easier to open.
Not you thinking you'd need 4 packs of oreos to get 18 biscuits! 😂
You are so cute you post your  Tik Tok short video
I just watched a video about the cheetos and pickle juice and this is what she did…. Put the flaming hot cheetos in a bowl. Pour all of the juice from a jar of pickles over the cheetos and sit for 30 minutes. Strain the cheetos out and discard them. Pour the juice back into the pickles in the jar. Close lid, refrigerate for 24 hrs,. Voila, flaming hot cheetos pickles to enjoy !?!
Jazzy: “I think I’ve over done it I think that’s too much” Also Jazzy: * continues to add more *
Mmm I now what to make Oreo truffles
Frozen grapes them selves are delicious. My family always did "frosted" grapes which is grapes rolled in sugar and then frozen. Also frozen grapes work as great ice cubes in wine if you like really cold wine.
Wait, are oreo truffles not that common?! I make them every year around Christmas for "goodie boxes" for family and friends.
The chocolate reminds me of the m&m chocolate bars, which are mars/galaxy chocolate 🍫 😋
For Christmas I make truffles like the Oreo ones but using gingerbread
We used to make those Oreo truffles allll the time in middle school! So nostalgic for me!!
also, easy trick to opening jars that always works, is to use a wooden rolling pin or spoon or whatever and whack round the sides of the lid until it pops a bit, then it’s easy to open :)
To get stuff not to fall off sticks you need to dip the sticks in chocolate and let them set a bit first, then dip the whole ball into the chocolate :)
UK cadbury dairy milk is horrible, Australian cadbury is the BEST
So earlier I ended listening to this with out seeing and as a person from the US. Those are not what I was thinking when she said smarties.
Hey Jazzy, do you have Sensodyne or a version of sensitive teeth toothpaste in the UK? I once had the same problem and my dentist recommended it…. Game changer! You may want to check into it, to see if it’s available and if it something your dentist may recommend!
Yummmmmmmm Garlic!!
Been eating my garlic on bread like you made since I was a teenager and I’m 40 now. It’s so delicious
I do the frozen grapes all the time, you definitely put too much on! I use one packet of jelly for a whole Punnet of grapes 😊
Ketchup flavored cheetos??? What
I can't be the only one that has known about the oreo truffles for years?! I made them in elementary school for a class snack one time! They are so good but yes very rich! I haven't tried it with different flavors of oreos yet but i bet that would be good too! The grape snack intrigues me just haven't tried it. Our 3 year old loves plain frozen grapes so thats the way we eat grapes.
What kind of tripod are you using for your phone? I think my daughter would love it for Christmas. Also the grapes/jello powder is something I’ve have for 20 years my teacher used to make them at school. Love love love them.
Sooo with the Cheetos and the pickles try eating one of each at the same time. That’s the best way to eat them.
That's a lot of sweets...my tummy hurts just watching.
Jazzy just always makes my day. I love her so much🥰🥰🥰
Pickle juice and chips...🤮🤮🤮
Is no one else disturbed by ketchup cheetohs? 😂
U should use “sensodyne” toothpaste.  Works well with people who have sensitive teeth
For the pickles your suppose to grind up the Cheetos and dip in a wash then roll roll the pickle in the crushed up Cheetos then deep fry or bake.
The grapes are so good!
Subway sandwiches rick #duckseason
Everyone who does the frozen honey is asking for cavities!!!! It hurts my teeth just watching!!!
Hi no hate but when you made the grapes the recipe is one punet of grapes with one pack of jelly crystals it's a slimming world snack, btw I lobe these videos
I feel like we swept speed past ketchup cheetos? What are those? Also why didn't you just flip the chocolate bar over and peel the popper off the chocolate  instead of peeling the chocolate off the pepper? 😂😂😂
I’m just flabbergasted at the foods that they don’t have. I never realized they were American only kinda things
I love that she goes “IM DEVASTATED” At the same time as she i smiling from ear to ear lol luv u jazzy❤️
With the honey, definitely need a much much smaller bite because it is going to turn to unfrozen honey in your mouth very quickly. With the grapes, you put way way way way too much Kool-Aid mix on it. You want them lightly dusted. If you don’t lightly dust them it’s going to be very much so too sweet. I’ve actually heard some people doing it with sugar-free Kool-Aid mix so that’s a possibility.
They put corn syrup in the honey that might help x
I may start freezing honey to use for cooking. Cuz I hate the sticky stringy mess everytime I use honey in cooking. Like when I make my honey walnut chicken with rice
When she got excited over the chocolate I got so excited with her. 🥺😂💖
That’s funny. I’ve been making Oreo Balls like that for years. They are amazing!
AVON, teleport NOW, Avon, now, I need teleport NOW, Avon!!!
I agree galaxy is the ruler of all chocolate, pity I can never eat it again as I’m allergic to dairy
Use lime juice instead of water to wet the grapes and they end up like a sour gummy sweets coating! It's so good
You are supposed to soak the chips in pickle juice then put the juice back in the jar of pickles for the pickles to get the flavor. Not eat the soggy chips lol
Great job girl
Just ABSOLUTELY adore you!
Wow the smarties chocolate thing looked amazing! Yummy
Ketchup flavored Cheetos?! I’m intrigued!!
You could also do jelly tots and smarties in alternate rows x
I don’t get why people test out the pop-it M&M/chocolate thing. There’s no mystery as to what it’s going to taste like. Just something to fill video time I guess. Like, what is anyone going to do with those after making them? Have it sit around for weeks as it’s slowly snacked on? Bleh.
You were close 200 Celsius is 392 Fahrenheit.
Anyone else thought the garlic squeezing looked like those videos when people clean out dirty pores 🤮 ain't read the comments so sorry if this is a repeated question lol
Freezing honey is not a good idea.   You can get bloating and diarrhea rom a lot of sugar consumption...and honey can contain botullism, and eating a lot of it is not good
The garlic bread may have been better with dried parsley instead of dried basil, Cream cheese isn't that just philidelphia ?
Fun fact: as long as the jar/bottle lid stays on and water doesn't get in, honey never goes bad. They have found jars of it in Egyptian tombs that was still edible :)
Please check the temperation of chocolate before doing chocolate bars next time. If you temper it will stay in its form after cooling. I recommend How to cook that by Ann Reardon youtube channel 😊 Also few tips: to open a jar put a butter knife between jar and lid and then just lift a little, air goes in the jar and it is easy to open. You can get garlic smell of your fingers by rubbing your hands on your kitchen faucet (if it is steel) with cold water, that takes away all the onion smell too. I would not eat those ”pickeled cheetoes” sounds horrible. And I think the best chocolate in the world is Fazer Blue by finnish brand Fazer 😊
How do you stay so slim with all this chocolate around!!!
“ I used to eat honey when I was younger because I wanted to be Winnie the Pooh” 😂😂😂😂😂
Galaxy vs Dove (US) vs Hershey’s (US) which is better? I’m from the US and would love to know what the verdict is.
I think Cadbury chocolates are much better than Galaxy, but that's just my opinion
I love watching jazzy’s videos they always make me smile and laugh ❤️❤️❤️
When I feel like having garlic bread I literally just spread some butter on a piece of bread and sprinkle garlic powder on and pop it the oven for 5 min super easy sooo good 😊  Love you hope you’re well ❤️
I've been eating plain frozen grapes for years they're amazing
Jazzy!! Your supposed to crunch up the crisps and then roll the pickle in the dust
That is such a jazzy sentence “i used to eat honey when i was younger because i wanted to be winnie the pooh”😂
We use sugar free jello for our grapes we did this way before tik tok
Fun fact, most of the store bought honey from supermarkets, isn’t real honey!
Your smarties are different than our smarties. Ours are not chocolate.
love the video jazzy, well done the stuff you did amazing the chocolate and smarties looked yummy and the chocolate balls looked nice to other things not to sure. x ❤️
Frozen grapes without the powder is even better
I couldn't do the honey one. Love ya jazzy 😘
Just a tip if you’re making cake pops and they’re not staying on the stick. Dip the sticks in chocolate first, before sticking them in your cake pops!
Wouldn’t have guessed ketchup cheetoes were a thing
I take my hot cheetos crush them a bit and put them and pickle juice in a bowl and eat it like cereal! SOO YUMM!! Soaking them just seems wrong to me gotta keep the crunch!
‘’That  is  villlle”
Frozen grapes are delicious on their own!
You did the pickle one wrong... Ur ment to crush the cheating n dip the pickle in the crumbs.
i knew it ! people are saying frozen honey "jelly" is much less sweet and i did not believe it for one second ! thank you jazz for being honest !! naomi jon did something with pickles and cheetos but it was a different way, is there really people who eat pickle juice soaked cheetos ?? ewwww😂
I am so sorry you have ketchup-flavored Cheetos over there. They sound horrendous. As for the rest of it, I saved this video because I'm definitely trying these!
Well that’s a coincidence isn’t it… I just made that garlic bread the day before last night 😂
Just putting normal grapes without anything in the freezer is delicious as a snack :)
Reading your description had me giggled asking to recommend you more tiptoes 😂😂😂🙊 easily please me 🙈
Noooooo the cheetos and Pickles! 🤮  You have to use flaming hot cheetos and just stick it into the center of the pickle and eat it that way.
I rhink that you did the grape one wrong maybe try to put less jello abd try a different flavor of jello like the blue one or sum. Also the chocolate pop-it looked AMAZING
You're right, Galaxy is the only chocolate I buy. 😍
The frozen jelly crystal grapes are popular amongst slimming world members! But yeah, way to much jelly! I would use less than half a packet of crystals on a whole punnet of grapes 🤣
Agreed.. Galaxy is the best chocolate!
The moment you said about eating honey because you wanted to be winnie the poo i started laughing my 5yr old wants to eat marmalade to be Paddington the only problem is he doesn't like marmalade haha xx
I love you so much and you will be glad to know I think Galaxy chocolate is the best 🤪 xx
I have been making Oreo truffles like that for years! They are the best sweet treat!
loveddd this!!!!
Excited to be watching this on my bday 🥰🥰
You need a rubber jar opener jazz
for the Oreo cake balls If you remove the filling  they won't be so clawingly sweet Jazz  Love Ya'
Next time just make the bread in oven with the butter on it and then rub a bulb of garlic on it.
Jazz cream cheese = philadelphia spread 😭 that's what cream cheese is
Jazzy to open a jar that won't open hit the bottom  and it will help to open jar when you opening I what take the jar to open  it 🤠😂
You said mahusive! I have been using that word since the 80s
The best chocolate 🍫 is milka it’s Swedish chocolate, soooooo yummy
Galaxy is definitely the best chocolate ever I don’t eat anything else it has to be galaxy everytime
Fun video!
Ketchup Cheetos!! I’m so jealous!!
Her: I feel like it’s to much powder  Also her: I’m going to put some more
We have Apple pie oreos in the US and made truffles out of them for my son. They are sooo good!
I'm British and always get 'flamin hot cheetos' at my local sainsbury, they also sell them at pound land! X😂❤️
I'm sorry, I was going go like the video but it had 666 likes so I could yet lol
Love you jazzybum!
To be honest, frozen grapes on their own are great
Galaxy IS the best chocolate, definitely!
omfg I literally have the same PLT top and bought it the other day after I got my friend to send me outfits hahahhaha amazing! Looks so good on you!
Frozen grapes taste sweet without a coating to make them sweeter😂😉
I've been making the oreo and biscoff truffles for years and I gift them to my neighbours at Christmas in a Christmasy bag with a bow always a win 🏆 ❤❤❤
Jazzy… thank you for making these vlogs and videos. Found you a few years ago. Love your energy. Love how positive you are. And I even like it when you’re not.  I had to look up Galaxy chocolate. I had to look up what dairy milk meant too.  I prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate. I’m in the minority when it comes to that here in the US.  Galaxy bar chocolate looks delicious.  So how are smarties, which are sweet and sour mixed with Galaxy bar taste? Could you taste the SOUR in the chocolate??
My treat for cleaning my disgusting bathroom....
Love these videos !!
That chocolate pop it was AMAZING....😁 I've heard eating frozen honey is actually pretty bad for you but I'm sure if one  doesn't do it on the regular its ok. I also have sensitive teeth and there's no way I could bite into frozen honey....
You make my day so much better💗
"Is that too much powder?"  "Let's put more"  *proceeds to put more in then the whole sachet*
You and Nick have a blessed evening
The garlic bit was one of those satisfying things to watch
You just made our hectic monday goood 🥺❤️❤️
I love you and your videos so much you and your personality is AMAZING 🥂💕
I just freeze the grapes
Happy Jazzy Day Everyone!!!💜💜💜
14….you stopped at 14!!
That honey would probably be really good if you had a sore throat. Love the chocolate super cool and your Oreos come in a different path than ours do in Canada. My husband and I thought that was pretty cool. Love you. We watched your video as a family my husband are oneyear old son and myself. My son literally has grown but watching New jazzie we all love you
I want a giant galaxy bar now, i love galaxy smooth😩😮‍💨🤤🥴😵‍💫
Yay we have Galaxy bars in Canada. They are so delicious
I used to eat honey when I was younger because I wanted to be Winnie the Pooh! 😂 Love that line!🤣🍯❤️
Need to temper the chocolate  You put in all microwave (expect small amount)for 30 sec at a time until melted then take chocolate out then add in the chocolate 🍫 you saved then stir the chocolate until all melted   Also have Suzette on hand to keep chocolate melted and runny
Chocolate looks AMAZING
galaxy chocolate gives me headaches and dairy milk doesnt so to me dm is the better chocolate. great video cant wait for the next one xx
I knew she was going try the frozen honey, hope your doing well jazz and love your videos 💖
"How thick is too thick?" That is the age old question.
Am going to try doing a chocolate pop it with my kids they have different shape ones xx
You are AMAZING, when I get a bit more money and my own place I will deffo be doing diys etc. You inspire me to do this, you make it look so fun and interesting
Jazzy chaotic energy is my favorite thing
In Liverpool they have the flaming hot cheetos
Galaxy is the best!!
Galaxy is defo waaaaay better than dairy milk!!!
I was freaking out when I thought you weren't going to arrange the candy by color!
No doubt about it. You made the best chocolate popper around!!
The amount of sugar jazzy consumed in this video ….. I consume that in a month 😂😂😂….  Things jazzy do to entertain us.. Love ❤️
Hey Jazz, great video! Always making me laugh! Cheers from 🇺🇸👍💜
Your smarties are soo different than ours. Your smarties look like skittles and our smarties are tart and chalky
It look like something else with the honey 😜😜😜😜😜
The garlic bread isn’t as garlicky because you roasted the garlic, which makes it taste sweet instead of having that garlic taste.
1:39 I feel like I did too much *continues to pour the whole packet* 😂 😂 😂
Oops but late but I’ll put post notifications on so I’m not late again hah anyways love ur videos they always make my day :)🤍
I freaking loved that rainbow chocolate popper thing omggg. I wish I could take a bite rn 🥺
The garlic 🤢 looks like a big pimple 🙈
No word of a lie when you’re microwave beeped, I actually had to stop for a second to remember what I’d put in my microwave, when I hadn’t cooked anything 🤦‍♀️
Try candy floss grapes
I love spicy garlic bread😋
🥰🥰🥰
First like and first comment woo hoo
Love your videos you are amazing
no need to watch before i click the thumbs up I know I will love this
I love you so much to the point that a day that goes by without watching your videos is a day that is just boring...your videos literally always lifts my spirits because I relate to you a lot actually personality wise😂💔they say laughter is the best medicine so it's safe to say that you are my best medicine 😂❤️ I love love love you 😘
Hi Jazzy! Love your personality ❤✌
You are the cutest 🌸💜
Yes Jazz
I love you so much to the point that a day that goes by without watching your videos is a day that is just boring...your videos literally always lifts my spirits because I relate to you a lot actually personality wise😂💔they say laughter is the best medicine so it's safe to say that you are my best medicine 😂❤️
I saw the garlic bread thing I want to try this
Its been bugging the life of me, what happened to ur kitchen draw?
💕💕 I love your videos sm !! The testing TikTok ones are really fun to watch !
I tried the garlic bread the other day. The garlic didn’t properly roast but it was still super good. We still have some of the butter spread for steaks and other foods. I love watching your videos btw ♥️
You could’ve used mascarpone cheese instead. It would work the same way as cream cheese
Your videos with food in it are always so much fun! 😋
You eat the hot cheetos with pickles and the juice like you eat cereal with milk. Lol 😆 love the face when you tried the worm
gwfhm vur.fyi
Not me thinking you said "make a *grape* snack" instead of " *great* snack" 😂 (p.s thanks for always making my day with your jolly personality Jazz :)
