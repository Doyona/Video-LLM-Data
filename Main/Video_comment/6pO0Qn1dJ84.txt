my problem is thinking i can do the same thing ....
😂😂😂😊😊
4:39 when Charlie says, "I don't know where it is" , I just about keeled over from laughing
Charlie has s great swing. He also has big feet which really helps him with his balance.Hopefully he can learn the other facets of the game and shoot low scores. I say this because I grew up around guys who had great swings but could never score low enough to earn a professional living playing golf. Time will tell!
Charlie is truly an extension of his father
I love this family.
Wow
Tiger will be the best dad to Charlie. This kid will be a stud and do it right way because of Tiger. So beautiful
Its so great to see Tiger at his probably happiest he’s been, you can tell he loves playing with his son.  Charlie is a little assassin. I got no doubt about that kid, he looks just like his dad when he was young on the course. Stone cold
Woweeee
A prodigy with wizardry, fierce young man. Hope I live long enough to witness his masterpiece. God bless Tiger, Charlie and rest of the family. Amen
Charlie is a natural golfer, just like his Dad!!
4:38 Charlie casually saying "I don't know where it is" and then placing it a few feet away! That's that casual Tiger style.
I think tiger has more fun playing in these tournament than competing anymore
That was great to watch. Wishing them both all success in future.
Charlie can really putt! Y'know?...& it mu$t b time to get Him His OWN LOGO...
OMG
What an amazing father son duo.
Tiger gets 6-8 more years coaching him, then he's the PGA Tour's problem
Incredible
wow
In the 2022 pga championship mito perraria ( I probably spelled it wrong ) blew his win by getting under pressure on the 18 hole and getting a water penalty. This kid had his first public shot  In front of fans with high expectations. This kid will be good
Well done Handsome Charlie 👍
was tiger that good at 12?
Tiger should have named his son Panther.
UD-OH!!!!!! Maybe the Woods dynasty has a new life.
Wow
Wow.  So you're a golf legend and just hope your son loves the sport as much as you do, and then Charlie comes along.  lol  Wow. ♥
we're looking forward to another tiger woods dr"g-induced car crash he always gets away with it
Wow!
Charlie is gonna be a legit problem for the rest of the golf world for then next generation... Would love to see it in 10 years him and his dad in the final group of a PGA Major going at it for a title.
There are thing in life that happens that makes you wonder if it was fate  along with hard work or what that's how I feel when I see 🐅 and Charlie Serena Williams and Venus but I can say with certainty you will never see it again so cherish the moment and thank  u tube  sign-in out
I noticed that Charlie modified his swing from last year's. Now, it's a copy from Tiger's swing. 👍
Tiger, I have always been for you, a Master Golfer! By, the way I'm a native Texan, and you made trash talk about Texas and Florida being slave States! This hurts because, one, it's not true and two, totally not necessary! Texas and Florida are conservative states and I am very proud of both. The slave States were in the deep South, where the majority of large plantations existed. When you made some really serious mistakes in your life, I felt sorrow for you. And, I was thrilled for you and Charlie and Charlie's success on the greens. My dad was a blue collar worker, he played golf with his railroad friends. We went to a lot of tournaments associated with the railroad, it was wonderful to hang out at the golf country clubs.  My saddest memory was when I asked my dad to teach me to play golf and he laughed at me because I was a twelve year.old girl.
For all the flack tiger got for his husband problems, its extremely obvious that he knows how to be a dad, and protect his kids. Just like his dad was there for him. Its amazing what an amazing dad can do for a son, just like an amazing mom can shape a daughter. We r losing our values even for raising kids as every generation goes on. To see him obviously teach Charlie to golf and sam in tennis is a testament to earl woods and Mrs woods. Forget about anything else tiger is a hall of fame dad just like earl and that's all that matters
If he keeps it up and is hungry as his old man  then we are dealing with another freakin monster here folks
They are so beautiful together !!❤️❤️❤️
We have a Goku and Gohan situation. Amazing!
Charlie, is a mini Tiger.  What a future he has ahead of him.  Tiger, you can tell how proud he is of Charlie.  Now, Tiger is the dad, teaching his son.  What a pair they make….
I'll let Tiger Woods on this one, but I don't believe he'll be the leader for this Stroke. Imagine this. Golf in Russia. It's Cold Outside. The Golfers need to wear a new jacket.
looks like we get 40 more years of Tiger
Tiger after his accident. Didnt he have a medal rod put in his leg?
I think Charlie is better because his dad got in a crash
Fantastic to see red shirts are back...👊
I seriously can't believe tiger can still play in any capacity after what his bodies gon through
❤️
Follow Buddhist and Meditation from Sri Lanka
Charlie Woods will break all his fathers records! Calling it now!!!!
This kid will be special someday.
Charlie's swing is amazing.
This should have gotten way more attention. Here I am seeing it for the first time one month later?
Happy to watch this father and son
I loved this.
Me encanta ver ese duo jugando El jiven con el mismo estilo del padre Pir li q vei sera mejir jugador q el padre
Since when golf had cheat codes
Charlie has great hands! Good to see Tiger in his element.
Arrogant kid.   I can see it.
Nice job Tiger and Charlie. I like how Charlie looks his opponent in the eye while shaking his hand. Very good manners.
Good morning. Wow' way to go charlie'
Legend  Legend in the making
Oh my word he's  the cutest player ever watching  golf just because of him luv this boy💪❤
Great golfer  , but if this was a white man that has done what he did then it would be a totally different story  ., GREAT JOB TIGER  .  GO SPIT ON THE FLOOR
Early 2000s Tiger and Charlie would be an insane combo!
If he is picking up his dad's game this fast, at this age, he is going to be damn near unbeatable when he does turn pro. Charlie Woods is scary good! ⛳️
This kid is talented….Period!
Never had a doubt he would play again I will bet tiger will win another major prolly masters in 2/3 yrs Charlie steal the show is so calm and cool, also very talented especially putting swagger
Tiger is awesome with him. He just lets him be him and stays positive in every situation. Kids game has really improved an year. We
Jesus that boy is good.
His golf playing and strategy appears to be fearless! He simply mentally controls his emotions and physically controls his playing, drives and putting, without a shred of doubt! And that folks is what it takes to win! So now,when players and sports commentators talk about " have you seen what Woods did"....it will be about Charlie! That is a pretty perfect circle to me!
Like father like son, Chip off the old block!!
Watching these videos I  keep remembering how Tiger was coached to play when he was really just a toddler.
Tiger you are so blessed.  What a beautiful young man you have raised. The Woods family is so gifted and should be so proud.  I wonder if you have a daughter that is as gifted????
Tiger woods is a Phoenix
Two great golfers ever!! ⭐🌟⭐⭐🌟⭐🌟🤩
Charlie will certainly be one to keep an eye on ! The apple did NOT fall far from the tree.
Day ones results lost it for them
I have a feeling if Tiger doesn’t reach 18 majors, Charlie will finish what dad started...great swing!
Charlie may be betta than Dad soon , Tiger Who ?
Tigers downfall was in lifting weights. It took too much toll on his body, resulting in too many surgeries. I hope he keeps his kid away from the heavy iron
Hellocharliesogood
That DNA is showing. Great round Charlie
This is a beautiful sight to see!  Welcome Back, Tiger, & Welcome to the Bigs, Little Man!
I just hope his son doesn't marry a CRAZY woman like Tiger did.......
Hilarious! The Father and Son are like mirror images at times!
What a fantastic duo!
The next wee Tiger 🐯 looks a good prospect if he wants it.
Tiger is the goat, and his son is right beside him. Great job to them both 😍😍😍😍😍
Wow..  5:05
0:36 Charlie throwing the pin to his dad after he sank that putt was dope.
I hope I’m as good as Charlie someday😁
amazing stuff that 💯
I can’t wait to see Charlie career really take off he’s definitely has a amazing golfing career ahead of him like his dad
Keep him away from the medias, they'll Finnish him
If you're going to pass down some DNA, otherworldly golf skill isn't a bad choice.
If only Tiger’s father could have met Charlie.
You do realize John daily and his son won!!!!!
Another legend in the making 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Charlie charlie woods yall

3:17 - not the stink face Charlie!! O no!! America, we are in trouble! There is a disturbance in the force...his name is Charlie!! 4:39 - "...I already know where it is..." bruh! Really??!!  #TW4L
Yes, Miracles are Alive!!!!!!!!!!!!
Charlie’s phenomenal… Will CLEARLY be a problem for other golfers in the near and foreseeable future. Whew.
Even at his young age, Charlie drives the family SUV while his old man rides shotgun.
like son like father maybe go down same road
Watch out world. We got a Tiger cub ready to take off.  Great to see Tiger back on the course.
Is this kid going to be better than his father?
Would love to see similar videos of other PGA father son duos, but we know that won’t happen.
응원합니다 💞  찰리ㅡ타이거^~^
We just getting started to enjoy the golf ⛳ of the wood classic
Charlie is 🐅 s mini me. Wat handsome confident almost 13 yr old. Wtching them 2 gether was a treat!
Simply lovely.
Charlie will break records in his career 👏🏿
Who won this tournament?!?
Great to watch.
I just hope people don't put to much pressure on him and he has a good head on his shoulders and doesnt act to cocky
how amazing would it be to have Tiger as your personal coach with the passion of a parent.
Shows what money for good medical care can do.
How awesome would that be for Dad or Son
So Cool!
I remember watching Tiger on That's Incredible. But I think Charlie is better.
🐪
Tiger and his son finished SECOND, also known as the FIRST LOSER. The JD’S also shot a 57 but no one cares about them.
I'm not a golf fan but this was a joy to watch LOL
That's was cool to watch 👍 Father and Son
To bad you’re not giving as much coverage of the winning team.
The most impressive thing is how this kid putted. Unreal
They lost!!!!
Too bad the team Daly win is in the Woods shadows...
I don’t watch golf at all but I just had to see tiger woods play with his son that’s pretty neat
At this rate, Charlie will become the greatest golfer in history, thanks to Daddy.
Would be great to one day see Charlie get a hole in one on one of these PNC Championships: with Tiger teaching him, and clearly very well, that day may not be far off and Charlie has a bright future ahead of him in the world of Golf. I see a Masters coming Charlie's way one day.
Yes Charlie and Tiger are good. But why all the nonstop coverage of their playing? They didn't win! It's like the media is hyping up Charlie and forgetting about all the other players on the course! More importantly THE ONES WHO WON!
When I heard crash tiger car   way it was reported. It was like legs bad way ripped apart  and here he is playing golf I was expecting wheel chair rest life  Stupid reporters
Charlie is a born natural..His swing is a clone of his fathers..👏
just made my night knowing Tigers swinging again lesssggggooooo!!!!
If only Sergio could putt like Charlie!
im on tears, what a magnificent moment.
Charlie's hip rotation is AMAZING. Dude is gonna be a force.
Like father, like son! Nó doubt
Wow amazing Charlie
NBA has Curry. NFL has Brady  MLB has Otani PGA has Charlie Woods in the near future. Best of luck young man!!👏
He looks just like his dad! His walk, his mannerisms, his game, it's uncanny.
Gosh.. incredible... ♥️
Is Tiger coming back? Surprise us all? If not, I’ve nothing to look forward to and I’m giving up golf altogether. But if he comes back......
I'm speechless... What an incredible display of skill so far beyond his years... WOW!!!! ⛳
L
watching this makes 1 wonder what might have been,,, sad stuff : (
He is so confident young boy wonderful to watch
So cool
Nice to see Charlie and Tiger playing so well but does anyone know who won?
Tiger Woods is a disaster
So nice to see Charlie and Tiger execute the coin toss, catch and fist bump so effortlessly. Tiger and poor ol' caddie Steve NEVER executed a single high five in their ENTIRE CAREER!
Once an adulterer, always an adulterer
The coolest thing about Charlie is how he seems like he's ice cold like his dad was when he was young lol
Hey Like Father Like Son. Wow!!!! I hope you are Able to See What i See!!! Almost Time to Turn Pro. Wow!!!😊😊😊😊
What is Charlies handicap?
Charlie is going to be a bigger star then his dad! That was pure class and he acted like he’s been there before such a great showing! Excited to see him grow
Charlie bout to smoke FR
Charlie your grandpa is so proud of you an your dad.
Beautiful
Its like Tiger playing with Tiger.
Loved  it!  Go Tiger and Charlie!!!
IT'S AMAZING Charlie wood make it look easy for a 12year old go Charlie
Charlie gunna be a pro for sure!
If Charlie can keep his head on straight, he might have a reasonable chance to match Jack N.'s 18 major.  Kid is going to be Tiger 2.0 in another 7-8 years.
Awesome to watch.  Between them and john daly (x2).   Not much better than seeing the kids of the legends following suit.
God dam that was brilliant to watch, really hope the young fella pursue golf
I was always a Tiger fan, but I'm now a Charlie fan. I can't wait to see what his golf future is like.
虎父無犬子耶 呵呵😄
No DNA tested needed for that kid.  He's like Tiger's "mini-me."  He's definitely inherited his Dad's golf gene and dare I say he's going to be very popular among the ladies.  I predict a golfing dynasty.  That kid is going to be winning PGA championships in places named after his Dad.
It's the same swing so good
まじでかっこいい笑
Absolutely love this!
@5.10 the famous club twirl 😂 What an amazing shot from a 12 year old playing with a crowd. I’ve got a feeling we’ll be seeing a lot more of Charlie in years to come.
Golf lives on!!!! 🐯
is it allowed to leave the marker when putting?? Charlie always picks the marker after a putt.. weird...
He's 12 you know, I get having Tiger as your father, but hey, he behave like a pro.
Nothing but love for Tiger. Always the comeback kid. Amazing. Golf is such a wonderful game.
My favourite part, is how happy Charlie is and he has to hide having a little giggle. Must have been magic for a father and son to have a day like this together.
Charlie is amazing at his age. Hope he continues to grow as a golfer.
Like father like son lol I can see the same EGO in Charlie that Tiger had and that’s what caused all his problems
In awe!!👍🏌
So?
They came in second, but the news I've seen has never said a thing about the father and son who won the match. I feel sorry for the little boy who didn't get much recognition for the win.
I hope Tiger's and Daly's kids end up perennial rivals on tour in a few years.
Talking about a "Mini Me". Wow!
Hey pga John Daily and John Jr WON!!!! How about covering the winners!!!
His putting🙌🙌
will be a PGA champion
Tiger l know how important is to joy with family, l know you have back problems is very difficult to do simple thanks around am glad you came back! I have 2 beautiful kids and l can’t play with them as l used to l need help!
This kid is poised beyond measure
Daly gets little pub? Didn’t they win?
My god what a boring sport.
Happy for Charlie, but sad for myself that I can’t play as good as a 12 year old 😂🤣
Let’s hope Charlie has several sons to continue the father and son legacy
That kid is nice! 👍🏾
Charlie might just be better than his dad
Like father.. like son.. they make a good team..
8 birdies in the row! Wow 😳 😁👏♥️🖤 Charlie is a goat someday!
GOD THIS MAKES ME FEEL OLD
All this attention on Tiger and his son must really suck for the winnner that haven't gotten any coverage.
God Damn this hurtz to watch😢 but it's great to see a father and son play together. I see why am depressed & life!🔗
I’ve had the true joy of watching Tiger throughout his career, but to watch him play golf with his son and see how incredible this footage is!   It just completes golf. I love it. What a absolute joy 😎🙌🏻  Tiger must be so proud !
Goat in the making
They only finished 2nd, wow, i want to see what team daly is like in that case
タイガーの息子さん、すばらしいです。あとはお任せですね。 How  wonderful!  It's great!
Great to see Tiger and Charlie play together. And hard to stop smiling. Thanks Tiger come back!!!!
Sometimes with older all-time athletes an injury can be a blessing in disguise.  Tiger's injury was drastic and will diminish him.  But by the time he had hit his thirties Tiger had so much mileage, with his training, his travel, his playing, his fame, his mishegas, his injuries, that he hit an unbelievable wall.  At 32 he was ahead of Jack's majors pace, then didn't win another major til he was 43, falling behind Jack.  That fact is almost inconceivable considering the thirties should be a golfer's peak.  In the coming 5 years he'll still be under 50, he'll play sparingly, and he's settled down.  Plus he's still Tiger Woods.  Poo poo it all you want, and we'll see how he looks when he's under major pressure walking Augusta's hills, but his swing in that final round looked fresher, sharper, faster and stronger, as did the shots it produced, than we've witnessed in over ten years.
That was just pure joy to watch. 👍👍👍💪💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That coin flip to dad👏 😂dope to see em play together! Gon bet on that kid when he grows up to win a tour
멋지다
Charlie's playing is a mirror image of his father. It wonderful to watch. We believe he'll surpass his dad.
How cool was that!
It's a lock next year. Healthy Tiger, and Charlie another year older (probably gonna add another 20 off the tee and will still be hitting from the same tee box). Bet the farm because the Woods' are winning PNC by 5 strokes in '22
Yes, Charlie is incredible, but I was amazed at how Tiger played.  He got tired towards the end, but for a 6-7 hole stretch today, he hit it as good or better than he has hit it in 20 years.
Who actually won the tournament? Haven’t seen one video about who ever that is. I think the only people playing were Tiger and Charlie.
So Cool
I don't even like golf, but I think this is pretty cool. Also nice to see that apparently, people have gotten over his "scandal". (Not condoning his actions, just making the point that it had absolutely nothing to do with anyone. It was between him and his wife)  Edit: And damn, I forgot how good Tiger was. The accuracy of his shots legit fascinate me. Kudos to him for making me even remotely interested in a game I couldn't care less about 99.9999999% of the time.

You would almost think that Tiger and Charlie won this thing by the bias coverage.  Congrats to John Daly and John Daly II
And this tournament  was mainly just for fun for them imagine how good Charlie  will be if he gets serious with like ole dad was
Neither are fazed. Crazy to see
Charlie’s swing is amazing
Just insane
Love them both! No matter what happens with Tiger's  career, this is the best!
That truly is a joy to watch. That little sweetheart will be as good as his dad.
I dont really follow golf. I enjoy it but its not a passion so I dont follow it. Are there any juniors in the same class as Charlie? The kid just appears to be on track to be a PGA star in another 10 years. Wonder if he follows his dad to Stanford or goes to a powerhouse like Texas or Tenn.
Just WOW
Wait, I thought John Daly and John II won?? Where's their shot by shot coverage? Where's is any dedicated video for them?? Oh yeah... Tiger nard hugging is more popular...
Came here to see video of John Daly and son John Daly II, the actual winners.
Incredible, what a great putting stroke young Charlie has, I suppose he’s got a pretty decent coach. Great to see the  on a course again.
Almost shed a 😢.  Tiger your the epimmidi of a good dad. 🎩  off to u 🐅
Tiger was a showman from an early age. Charlie seems a lot more grounded. Here's me hoping that he's got all that's good from his dad and none of the bad.
Chars and Little John are gonna be a force to be seen in about 10 years
I remember when I was a kid watching Tiger Wood's and his dad play together when his father was introducing him to the world of golf on national TV. And now it's so good to see that Tiger and his son playing golf together as well, keeping the tradition going. 💕
Tiger seeing his son play with him seems like its given him new life
Unpopular opinion but I think this kid has something special gonna be some player in my opinion
The boy might end up better than his old man. Well played kid. Great to see Tiger back.
Obviously great potential, I’d like to see him play in wet conditions on winter fairways and greens  when it’s just above freezing and you’ve four layers of clothing on.
Worst case scenario for Charlie, He makes six figures gambling on the road. Best case he becomes Charlie the GOAT. This kid is phenominal

Congrats to both. Tiger came back he is unstoppable. His son wow 😳😲.
Wow..chip of the old Block!!!
Charlie became a lot better as soon as Wonka gave him his factory!! Must be the glass elevator and the singing Amazing!!!
So what happened to this man?  Was there a ruling on why he sped off that cliff?
Outstanding for both of them. Tiger looks good playing here!
Charlie looks like his dad
An absolute joy to watch. Hard to stop smiling. As if having Tiger back wasn't enough, Charlie is class!
Stunning just stunning,  wonderful to see father & son in total harmony! So excited to see my golfing hero rise again!
For many years I've wanted to play like Tiger, now I wish I could play like Charlie.  Great to see them play together,  great to see Tiger playing golf again.
You can already tell his dad forced him to play, look at how unhappy that face is 💀
Imagine Charlie on the pga in a few years with Tiger as his caddy. They will be unstoppable.
Charlie has his father's greatness in him. The supernatural gift for this wonderful game, the inner belief, work ethic and determination like his dad. If he does follow his dad's footsteps into pro golf in the future Charlie at 12yrs old is showing very good signs he can be a major force in years to come. Tiger's looking so sharp, particularly his short game. Hope he gets his full speed back. He truly is on another level when he's firing on all cylinders. A pleasure to watch.
Charlie will be a great golfer just like his Dad!
Tiger was knocking down the flagsticks and Charlie was knocking down the putts. What a team, how long before we see Charlie in a green jacket?
Great round but why no Daly posts??
Go ahead CHARLIE WOODS YOU ARE GREAT LIKE YOUR DAD!♥️
Tigers dad would be so proud of his grandson!!!!
Daly and his son also shot a 57 that day, and won the tournament.
JOHN DALY and his RACIST son ,    #BLM
Man these two are pretty good...
I don't know if Charlie will continue his journey in golf. But if he does we will watch is progress with great excitement.

What a beautiful swing Charlie. Charlie is brilliant . Really joy to watch Tiger and Charlie . 👌👌
Brilliant golf for sure.  Is anyone else concerned that Charlies doesn't seem to actually be enjoying it though? I mean ... I don't get any sense of happiness or pleasure. Barely a smile passes his lips ... and he's 12 yo playing amazing golf!
There's a Chinese sentence says that "A tiger father never got a dog son"
Bring your kids to work day. These are fun to watch.
My channel will help you relax and sleep

4:37   Charlie Says "I don't know where it is."  ... Lands 2 feet from the hole
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life1
Tiger 🐅 and his mini me❤

This was awesome
How to I buy shares in Charlie Woods
타이거우즈가 사고이후로 샷이 더 좋아진거 같은데요 이런걸 전화위복이라 해야하나요 믿을수가 없네요 ㅋㅋ
This isn't normal! He is only 12
You would think that the Woods were the only ones there playing. I've seen one story and one story only about the winners, John Daly and his son. The PGA should be ashamed but they're not.
Brilliant. Great play Charlie. What a putting stroke. I'm guessing we have another 30+ years of Woods' dominance ahead.
So skillful already with powerful sound at 12.
Damn, what did team Daly do to out score this duo according to the score board at the end there? I should have watched the event. I'm going to assume Daly's son was much older than Tigers, maybe a slight advantage in that case?
Why not acknowledge that they lost in the title?
Tiger was swinging good, taking good hard cuts at the ball, and, of course his short game and putting was great. If his legs keep getting better he could be competitive again on the tour. Charlie is an awesome 12 year old golfer. Forget about him as an amateur, I see him being a winning player on the PGA Tour someday!
And Charlie's gonna be great!
It looked real good to see Tiger out there again!
NICE
Tiger is smart. He's raising a winner.
incredible
insane...
This kid is gonna make me get into golf
https://youtu.be/m36uOUSJFjE
This kid has a green jacket waiting for him.  WOW 🤩
There really couldn't be anything better than this.  I long for the day that I can play a round with my little guy
It is a miracle and joy to watch Tiger and Charlie! Tiger has been through a lot and it is nice to see him again having fun playing golf.
Golf! a game of absolute magic!
Wow like father like son.
Sorry if I'm not mistaken they said his leg broke
Tiger looks healthy that's great. Like father like son.
I want to see a Team Woods/Team Daly pairing next year.
So cool 👍
wondering if lamarck was right after all
And yet NO blood test at the hospital for a daytime , no skid mark crash. In broad daylight. On dry roads. How ?
Damnit that boy is good he is damn good!!! Has his father mannerisms I am looking forward to seeing him in the future
https://youtu.be/JhgKib3Wtss
Amazing to perform so clutch at that level of pressure.  🇺🇸
love it!!!
Was there any doubt the son of the greatest golfer wouldn’t be good??
I couldn’t do that in my dreams 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Talk about amazing 👏 ❤
https://youtube.com/shorts/n9PqPwE3nio?feature=share
So thrilled to see Tiger back playing golf!
The grimace on Tiger's face says it all BUT that smile on his face as well when Charlie is hitting it crisp and putting like "Vintage Tiger" is priceless
Damn. that hug at the 18th actually brought a tear to my eye. Fantastic stuff!!
that club twirl.  absolutely fantastic XD
The swag that kid has 👏👏. Definitely taking that Woods name and running with it
Absolutely a pleasure to watch
Charlies’s 17th hole gave me goosebumps. So talented.
Lot's of Tiger-esque mannerisms in his boy wonder. 12 birdies in a row? Charlie back at home; "Second sucks!"
Charlie is incredible! He makes the game look so easy!! Like somebody else I’ve seen! What a treat to see him play with his GOAT pops!!
Absolutely amazing.
Charlie the Star was born in 2009 let that sink in
Charlie is amazing. He should be on the pro tour immediately. Never seen a young player like him. Poise, calm, classy…he is the future.
My goodness.
I wish I had a dad like Charlie.....growing up, my dad used to punch me in the head all of the time
Dad, I just beat you, is what Tiger wants to hear. The rest will be history.
I think about all of the mental warring Tiger has had to do with himself, injuries, and with the media trying to destroy him. To see him do well and then have the icing of his son performing like this.....almost brings a tear to your eyes.
My God...this is incredible.  Tiger on his own is entertaining (just check the network ratings when he plays versus when he doesn't). But this is even more entertaining.  Charlie's game is just mind blowing.
First the Tiger and now Charlie Cat
Like father, like son. The next phenom.
Increíble cómo juega ese niño, da gusto verle
Ya just watch the next Goff super star Boys n girls....
wow...simply impressive!
So Glad I watched....Just Fantastic!!!
Can’t wait to see Charlie turn pro!!! He’s going to burn 🔥 up the field
DON'T JUDGE ME 🔞🔥🔥🔥
Kid will be a multi PGA champion in his career! He is amazing to watch
Charlie Woods might not be as good as his Dad, but he certainly will be who we talk about for years to come. Just 12 is amazing.
Charlie's phenomenal ... and the old man playing with him is quite good as well.
Beautiful to watch... The two making the best of an horrendous  year.

Welcome back tiger
Gee, Little Tiger has better form than Trump.
Man, I can't wait until me and my son can go play in a tournament and shoot a +5 😂😂 I missed this live but the highlight reel is amazing.
Lil Charlie is already a legend! That was incredible.
This video hits you right in the feels.. only real men shed a tear watching this
Maybe we'll see a young Finau out there some day! Been rooting for him since seeing him on that golf show called "The Big Break".
Let's see how big his head gets.
Every headline is Tiger and son.  Not one mention of who actually won or anyone else in the field.
Fantastic... Tiger and his son is best of the best golfer.
First its good to see Tiger able to play again, however, NBC and the Golf Channel acted as if Tiger and his son were the only ones playing. The announcemers acted the same way. If I were on one of the others teams, I would be saying, hey we are playing too. Nelly the only female got very little coverage. I actually muted my television because of the announcemers
I'll be looking forward to the PNC Championships every year more so than most tournaments now lol
😁
Take them off the Pro Course and see how they do!
I think he can win again and he’s got another major
Charlie looks like a miniature Micheal Jackson
Incredible playing, love the father son hug at the end.
I hope he turns out to be a better person than his old man !
Love when the kid throws the marker to his dad lolol
Not only am I impressed with Charlie Woods and how incredible his demeanor is on a golf course for a 12 year old young man how about tiger to see him on a golf course after his horrific accident just tells you he's built a little bit different go team Woods
Who won it?
He looks so bored whilst living every golf fan's dream haha what a legend
สุดยอด
Charlie has copied his dad's swing and his body language and stances while on the course. Fun to watch.
I wish you could turn the commentators off
phenomenal absolute joy to watch young charlie makes the game look so easy his playing partner looks ok aswell 🤣🤣
WTH
Life is second name of problem  https://youtube.com/shorts/1beW_rBPw98?feature=share
Man, Tigers obviously still got the game to compete. Hopefully we see him in the majors in  22. Guy is unbelievable
Should this golfer turn pro now, or wait until hitting puberty?
4:35 "I don't know where it is" since it's directly in the sun lol. Ended up being an amazing shot
Charlie's tee shot to 17 was the shot of the year. I hope I live long enough to watch him on the PGA tour. What a talent young man.
I felt more pressure watching this than Charlie did PLAYING this. Amazing
This just verifies the ancient Chinese proverb, a tiger father has no dog son.
Are you going to show the highlights of the winning team????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Tiger may still not match Nicklaus's 18 majors, but imagine if his son does!
when youre young like charlie you just had that balls to attack the pin regardless of its location and wind, he'll get wiser later .
Charlie’s putts are like his dad’s were back in the day. Firmly hit, no doubters with lots of confidence behind them
Tigers back !!!
Love it but find it odd how they didnt win yet I  get no video recommendations for the Dalys that DID win (shrug)
Charlie hit more great shots and putts in 2 rounds than I'll hit in 2 lifetimes... I smiled the whole time... 😁😁😁
love them😯😍😍😍
MAGICAL TO WATCH #GODISAWESOME
absolutely amazing putting from Charlie He is not a future star… he plays like a star already👍
For the boys n girls https://youtu.be/sActeCD-t0A
Tony
best thing i’ve seen all weekend! life doesn’t get any better for Tiger than this
Big shoes to fill
Knock down shot 2 inches from the hole. Wow.
How about John Daly?  Winning.
Uhhh, how can a 12 year old be that good at golf? It literally took me 3 years, as an ADULT, to develop a proper swing. God, I'm such a failure.
Wouldn’t that be something if Charlie makes it on the PGA tour. From the looks of things right now I don’t think that would be much of a stretch
what a great breath of fresh air this tournament was !!! thanks to all involved in making this such a success
I want to see Charlie get out of trouble the way Dad can.
both stuck in their mechanics, can you see it?
I’m calling it now, Charlie will win more majors than Tiger. I may be wrong, but from what we’ve seen, it’s a possibility.
It’s great to think we have another generation of stars in the rise like little john, tigers son and many others! Can’t wait to see how they grow up and play. Either way tigers son can already beat probably 85% of golfers today!
Charlie/Char has that young Michael Jackson look to him, a Thriller look.
This needs to be the final scene in the Tiger Woods Documentary. Greatest comeback ever!!!  💯
crazy
John Daly and his son one this event, Not sure why they are not getting any media coverage
I was happy for them, but the Daly's winning is a pretty heart warming story.
What is Charlie's drive averaging so far ?? Is he carrying it over 250 ..
Hopefully, Charlie will not have Dad’s Ego
Hopefully, Charlie will not have Dad’s Ego
Tiger is lucky to not be 6 feet under or ashes in an urn. Hopefully his automobile skills are better. His driving is a danger to all of us
He’s a great putter but he’s a little too cocky given he hasn’t actually achieved anything in the game yet. It’s a fine line between confidence and arrogance.
Incredible to see the GOAT back out there and playing so well! Charlie ain't bad either!⛳🏌️🐯👏🏼
These two, incredible. Everyone keep watching this kid.
6 years from now, will we be watching them both in a major?
TW & CW just phenomenal...what an accomplishment- something special...👏  👍✌️
You know John Daly and his son won this right?
There's a golfer that here today, and they call him Charlie A different golfer who thinks his way, and they call him Charlie Kind of young in the brow, Charlie; a year or two, you'll say "WOW," Charlie! The kind of golfer that's gonna stay, and he's here now, Charlie.
Charlie has put the rest of the pros on notice, and he’s only going to get better! Iron sharpening iron.
And they were not even in the lead, lol.
Welcome back tiger, that little boy will take your place someday, he's an incredible golfer just like his dad.
My opinion is that what keeps Tiger going is that one day him and his son could actually compete on a pro tour someday.
Tiger and Charlie playing catch with a quarter
And they didn’t even win? 😳
Old John and his boy John won this, followed closely by a 12 year old and his dad who turned in a score that was equally spectacular on the last day. Great stuff. Especially since both of the older partners in these teams have overcome some serious medical issues just to be there. If Charlie can keep a certain the love and drive to play this game, we'll be seeing him light it up in amateur and college play soon. Reminds us all of a certain 3 year old on Johnny Carson....
Love it!!!!  Good for them and all the dads!
top 5 at St Andrews next July , if not a win. his 2018 second to Molinari is in his mind, he knows he has what it takes to win a Major again   after winning the 2019 Master's. He's able to honestly downplay his ability/ chances due to his injuries. Not hitting long drives on the par 4's also plays into his strategy of course management at St Andrews. If he gets into that "old style" course management type of mode I think he's gonna be   there or there abouts come Sunday
First, I must say that this was a beautiful moment. However, it made me wonder about the people whose legs were amputated after accidents who could have still had their legs if they were rich and famous
It’s just brilliant to watch these two playing golf together. Charlie has a magnificent swing and what a putter! The greatest ever golfer to have lived now nurturing his son who clearly shows he intends taking the baton for the next generation to watch in awe.
great to see Tiger playing on Sunday again, felt normal....Charlie is going to be tough.
The kid has talent, just like Dad. Amazing game n maturity.
Can we just talk about how composes he is in front of a crowd?!? I hate having to tee off in front of the group that lets me play through!
I can’t believe I’m more excited to see Charlie hit than tiger
Unbelievable!
I am just happy to see that both of them are having so much fun. At Charlie's age, that is the most important thing.
Shhh ... let's not talk about the Dalys.
Fantastic! I want to be the first to congratulate Charlie for becoming my new favorite player! 😄 Oh wait, who's that..Little John! The future is bright for golf.
Watch Tiger put weight on that right leg - slow back up. 2:58
That clubtwirl tho 😁👍
The swing of a future major winner? It's getting refined already! 0:20
Like father like son good stuff
tiger should of called him LION 🦁
Super!!!!
Stellar stuff from the 3W and 1W
Charlie made like 8 or 9 birdie putts in one round, kid has a really nice putt game
Legend is back! 🤩
I guess it's amazing that Tiger Woods can play like that after a serious car accident, virtually no prep for the event, and legs he can hardly stand on for extended periods of time without lots of pain.  But his son Charlie is truly incredible, playing almost like a pro and hitting fantastic shots, putts, etc. with no apparent nerves. As a 12-year-old with a small, thin frame, he hits the ball better than many college golf team guys. He's like a mini-Tiger, or Tiger cub with mad game.  I have to say, though, that we shouldn't forget what left Tiger Woods like he is--car accidents that were his fault, the recent one and the one years ago when he was on pills and alcohol, as I remember.  He's a complex figure, but let's not gloss over the many negatives of his own doing.  I hope his son, whatever he does in life, learns from his father's mistakes as well as his many strong attributes.
Tiger has given birth to a Cheetah
The GOATS🐐🐐⛳🔥
You can see all of young Tigers attributes in him. Absolute joy to watch. He's going to be a future major champion if he decides to continue into professional Golf. Great to see Tiger back as well. One more green jacket before you retire please Tiger!
Is Tiger now playing after his car accident?
Charlie is 825/1 to win a major by the time he is 25yr. Well worth a bet!
Wow just amazing to watch!!
just 12? damn he's got game already
The Dalys won.
Jist give tiger another year to recover that leg, I still believe he will do whatever it takes to win again
Who cares. Could've used this  Air time to show missing and exploited children.
Charlie Woods is some player, absolutely incredible, that boy is going to be an outstanding golfer. Tiger, your not too bad either 😊
That kid is gonna be one great 🏌️‍♂️ golfer.
Charlie need to still take it up the notch to win Championship but he is definitely already qualify for the PGA at his age..
I haven’t seen Charlie before today. Putting the Sunday red aside, I was blown away by how much his game mirrors his fathers
Wait til he turns pro. The golf world belongs to him.
Watching these 2 is the closest we are gonna get to seeing Tom and Tommy Morris playing together.
I have a feeling we haven't seen nothing yet.
Amazing display by the Woods, but how is this young guy not happy on the golf course ? Is he being trained very hard by his dad, like Earl did with Eldrick ? Is he gonna be another troubled soul ? Let's hope not. Great golf anyway
Wow, they created a little robot. Good way to crush the child.
Man,,, Tiger is definitely finding fun seeing shots like that...... NOICE
A young champion in the making
i love seeing Charlie and Lil John. so cool
It's absolutely ridiculous how good this kid is!! He's killin the ball off the tee, his short game is awesome,he got the gift and his putting stroke is just crazy!!  His presence on the golf ⛳ coarse is felt, his attitudes and demeanor is beyond his years he was a total professional and Tiger should be extremely proud of this young man;!  Charlie Woods is going to be better than his father. That's exactly what Tiger is expecting of him. He says Charlie can be whatever he wants to be ,    The last time i seen greatness for the first time. Early    1980's  the first time I I've always been a sports fan and had a very good sens  for talent. The world was about to change and the the game that Michael Jordan brought with him outta college was nothing like anyone has ever seen!!  'sThis kid has the making of a true golden child. I'm looking forward to watching the kid handle himself once he arrives at the door step to stardom he is going to be the new standard. Tiger Woods was a star at an even younger age when his father showed him off to the world on the Mike Douglas Show.  Now it's time to unleash young Charley into the public and see how far he can market himself he will be worth more than his own father in my opinion Tiger groomed and prepared his son to be a great success and the sky is the limit. #tigerprodigy#
Love this kid!
Charlie on 16: I don’t know where it is… Drills it to within 6 feet… Kids a beast!
My dad sleeps around, a lot. He is not a good role model when it comes to being a devoted husband.  But hey, he is good at golf!
This is unbelievable
If Charlie decides to pursue golf,  it’s gonna be an honor watching him play.  So much like his dad already.  He could be something special for sure.
Why aren't there any awesome footage from the Daly Boys?
Damn kid is SAFE from 10 foot. like he's expecting them to drop. Good eye!
I remember watching Tiger battle Steve Scott for his third US Am in '96. Then in the '97 Mercedes hitting his tee shot to 6 inches to beat Tom Lehman in extra holes. I made my wife watch the shot and listen to the roar of the crowd, and told her this was the start of something special. Amazing that was 25 years ago, and now I'm watching his son trying to fill some very large shoes, and doing a damn fine job.
Who won?   That's right and what was on his shirt?
Yes, Charlie is incredible, but I was amazed at how Tiger played.  He got tired towards the end, but for a 6-7 hole stretch today, he hit it as good or better than he has hit it in 20 years.
Just WOW.
They're Flawless! WOW!
learning from the best and the best doing the teaching, doesn't happen often in that manner :)
Nice to see Tiger back , he has a good rapport with young Tiger
Haha tiger not even best player in his house anymore what a little player his son is brilliant
👍
Charlie's confidence is insane for his age 🤣 Love it
Earl must be watching from above with tears of joy in his eyes.
Oh great it's bad enough I have to deal with lebron james kid in the news
Talk about 'Tiger Line'!!
It's lucky he injured his right leg. If it was his left, with the mount of torque he puts on that during his swing, It's career over completely.
Man, can the kid putt!!
Dang, the putting stroke he's got already!
What a pleasure to see  👀
Charlie future major winner confirmed. Big Cat is back!!!
As a black man this like everyone mentioned is a joy to see and watch. I'm not trying to turn this thread into political but not a Obama fan, but like he said every household needs to have a father a positive one at that. Tiger has his flaws like any man as long as you keep stepping up to the plate when it comes to the kids an this shows. 👏👏👏 next generation
Future Ryder Cup Pairing!
Tigers son is good enough to play pro..I mean maybe he couldn't drive it as far sure that'll come in just 4 years or so...he strikes the ball very well as good as any pro and he's just a kid. Can't wait to see him playing on tour and to see what kind of records he'll break easily no doubt
HES BACK 💪
Hope Tiger continues to teach little Charlie the game. Just hope he hires a professional to teach him to drive😆😆😆   a car that is.
Charlie has one of the nicest swings I’ve ever seen
Charlie Woods the real sleeping dragon.  He will be the best there ever was!
The only question left in my mind is whether Charlie will win 19 Majors.
This makes me so happy
If i would’ve been watching this live I would’ve been crying the whole time
I'm still not convinced he won't be playing regularly on the tour.  This guy never quits, and if his health keeps improving, there's definitely a chance.
I could watch that every weekend think they need to add more events 🤔
Charlie is so lit 🔥 and so his daddy
Watched in person Fri 17 Dec Sat 18 Sun 19 Dec 2021…what a joy to watch.  TW limped some.  Lots of fans in red.  Thank you, TW
He looks like a kid who would be named Charlie haha. I just know so many charlies that have a similar facial structure.
What a beautiful boy , how proud can a dad be,  What’s amazing is all the pressure on him how he performed like a winner I hope tiger can cherish these moments he’s totally blessed
Best golf in years!! From anyone.
My God just superb golf
I’m so happy I’ll grow up watching Charlie in the PGA, he’ll be even more fun to watch older
Well, hello world. Welcome Charlie.
The more he grew up, the more he looks like his dad.
Can’t believe I would be saying this but who’s swing would you want! Charlie sure has got the Woods swagger!
So great to watch!!!
Remarkable...
Big F N deal.🥳 💩 Show
I see many of EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT!  in Charlie's future.
Tiger is GOAT, a true professional athlete to overcome the physical pain & mental health. He is everything that Simone Biles was too....until she quit of course.
Just seeing Tiger back is nothing short of a miracle.
Unbelievable. Tiger must be so proud of his son that's awesome to watch
Does charlie even like playing golf???
This makes my entire year
There's just too much joy going on right here. That's all I have to say.
Like his dad Charlie seems to be so cool under pressure.
Charlie is nasty!! Love that kid already. I love the mini Tiger mannerisms. Great to see the goat back out on the grass.
すげーよタイガー！ 復帰嬉しすぎる😭 息子はもう大人のスイングだ！
They Won...Charlie's only 12. He's half the size of all the other participants. Other pairs should concede they won. Absolutely fantastic!
This is awesome to watch!!!
Tiger the superman . This guy's unbelievable. Go for that 16th major now TW .
It looks like Charlie will be just as good as his dad.
I just can't imagine Charley feeling any pressure whatsoever. When Tiger Woods is your dad.
I'm so glad I decided to watch this today. What a round from father and son. I know he Tigers sin but you can see that Charlie has a natural feel for the game of golf. It's gonna be a amazing day when he takes his first steps officially on the PGA Tour. What a round! Holy cow!
Charlie has a GREAT swing.  And man can he putt.  Reminds me of how his dad putted in the early 2000s where he just made everything when it mattered.  This was awesome to watch.
5:05 what a shot!
Sorry to disappoint the Tiger fan boys but Jack Nicklaus will always be the hands down GOAT on and off the course.
That kid is ridiculous
Charlie is going to be a superstar golfer
Love watching Tiger and Charlie ! This kid is the FUTURE  ⛳️
Charlie with no fear. Usually when I say ‘dad I have no idea where it is’ it’s not next to the darn pin haha. What a talent! So much fun to watch. I don’t even want to think about the future etc etc because that’s just nuts. He’s a kid. He shouldn’t have to feel pressure but it’s just how amazing he’s been playing where it can’t be avoided. Amazing performance for team Woods. Good luck the rest of the way 👍🏼
Lovin’ it- father/son tourneys rock!
why do i feel such a relief watching Tiger play golf again???
Charlie's swing is money
Uh… they didn’t win? Second place? No mention of Team Daly???
この子誰なの😳😳😳タイガーとこんなに仲が良い！！
Tiger deserves it. All his hard work behind the scenes paying off
Can sense Tiger’s pain while walking but when he needs to make a full swing he still can stick it close. I’m sure his love for Charlie is motivating him too
Team Tger reel winner hear.man nn juvenile against too adults..knot fare.
Things just got interesting
Trust me golf fans will take a limping Tiger than a no Tiger at all. What a joy to watch golf this weekend.
Amazing to watch
Tiger is Miss Congeniality!
Well done, Charlie.
...love it !
Thank goodness for airbags, crumple zones and a five star crash rating. Buy Hyundai.
Okay, I don't know that much about golf but 15 under seems like an absurd score for golf. Is it because it's doubles? Is it an easy course?
Such a natural "that shot was so nasty" face lol love it
hey PGA guys... you do realize other people played right??
That was emotional to watch for sure
"Hello, world."
That was BEAUTIFUL
Wow, this is just so awesome! An absolute joy
you'd think that they'd force tiger and son to have a cart driver.
So great I love this. What a Christmas gift to watch
Chuck woods
Absolutely love it
All this hype and they got beat by a Diet Coke drinking, cigarette smoking, over weight Santa Claus looking dude and his kid from Arkansas.
Glad to see tiger back out there again we could of lose another legend.
Tigers not dropping that coin toss… seriously though Is there a better duo? Don’t think so… also if anyone is wondering Charlie is playing blades.
Charlie playing golf with such confidence man, unreal!
I feel priviledge to see the Woods playing together at such a high level....
Tiger showing class, as a father now too.
THERE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE MORE OF THESE TOURNAMENTS!!  Father’s day weekend for sure!!
Fearless just like his dad was back in the day. A Woods could break rhe Golden Bears record, it just might not be Tiger.  I know, it's too early for speculation but damn can Charlie play some golf!!!. Very impressive.
Its obvious to me that tiger has used the medbeds something most of the public has no clue exist.Hes showing no signs of the car accident where he had injuries that ppl never believe he would come back from.Get ready for a the impossible but your seeing it now
kid can putt!!
Good to see him playing but his swing had very little power can barely get off his right side and yes I love tiger.
I’m not even a golf fan or anything but this is really amazing to watch. Charlie is so so good for a 12 year old.
What a future that young man has. Pleasure to see Tiger on the field again.
I’m glad Tiger is back! 🦾
I don't know if it's good drugs or what but the swing looks good.
The telecast was AWFUL.   The press has such an infatuation with Tiger.  I'm sure he's a good dude but they spent 75% of the telecast covering him and his son.  Would have loved to see lots of ALL the groups.  Some very interesting stories there....but NO.  It's all Tiger.
So awesome
Your dad is a legend but you Charlie man, you stole the show
This is quite phenomenal
Didn't think tiger would ever play again, let alone be good
I give it 4 years and we'll see Charlie in a tour tournament.
I wonder with Charlie, how much of this is part Tiger genes vs. Tiger training.  Either way, hope this kid continues pushing and I'll be waiting for his college and professional career.
5:06  He's gonna have some fans.
Tiger needs this  - his son has effectively given rebirth to his golf game - these two together are special to watch
So cool...  Just ...  So cool
Not to take anything away from anything Charlie did, at the age of 12, he is a outstanding golfer, but to see the shots that Tiger made, after being out of the game for so long.  How can you doubt that, when he is back to a healthier Tiger, he will win many more tournaments.  I hope that Charlie sticks with the game of golf and go on to make a name for himself.
Charlie will win at least 25 Majors before he is done, what an amazing child...
Kids so clean with it
Wow wow wow! Just incredible to watch this! We all know about Tiger The Legend, but Geez Louise that Charlie is something else!!! Incredible what those two guys put together for 3 days. Spectacular! Can you say Charlie has swagger!!!!  Lol. Holy moly!  Starts walking towards his father’s putt just as he hit it. Just knew it was going in. Wonder who he learned that from? Lol. And Steph Curry too. Steph throwing it up and heading back down court before it’s even in the hoop. Lol. I would have paid serious money to follow Tiger and his son around for three days! Congrats!  What a show!😊🙏🙏👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😉😉
Charlie is a pro.
Maturing is realizing this 12 year old would beat you by 20 strokes
😢 wish I had a dad like tiger all I ever got was beat
He has his character...
Charlie got that swagger, hopefully we'll get to see him and Little John light up the tour one day.
Amazing to see Charlie playing this well. Tiger played well but keep in mind the pins were in the middle of the greens.
Charlie showed up dad on more than a few approach shots.
Sensational!
Tiger is an even Greater Father than he is Golfer, and I believe he would agree with that.
Inspiring! Go Tiger! Go Charlie!💗💗💗
Dad didn’t give that to him, he earned it.
Wow!! 2 for 2 .Good to watch.
Father and son Golf at its best 😀⛳️⛳️
there are literally no other videos on the rest of the field
🙏❤️❤️❤️
would Tiger ever play Champions later in life?
Like this is absolutely amazing! Kids got something not a lot of people have… but, where is the Daly’s highlights… they did win the dang thing! Kids got some talent as well.
Will there be a Daly highlight video tonight?
Everyone who rags on watching golf just doesn't even know. If Charlie keeps this pace they may be talking about which of his Dad's records he'll be breaking and Thanksgiving dinner in the coming years.
Charlie’s tee shot at 17.  How does a 12 year old have the best shot in this stacked field?  Unreal
Wow , a  woods might  get the record yet
Charlie may very well extend the legend of his father and finish what his father could not. It's just unbelievable what he can do at age 12. I thought I was looking at a seasoned professional playing. Outstanding.
Drive for show, put for dough. Charlie’s putter is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Black and red is gang stalking racist and scammers colors
So happy to see the 🐐 back on the greens. ❤️
Hope Charlie has a normal happy life and upbringing!
Where's the video compilation of the pair that won?
Was awesome watching the 🐐 play this afternoon. Seeing Tiger doing so well made me super happy too!
LOVE it, your both the BEST 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩!!!!!... AWESOME and I so!!! Happy for TIGER AND CHARLIE WOODS ❤💕🙏👌AMAZING 👍👍👍
So close
We all tuned in to see if Tiger still has it. I’m starting to wonder if we’re not paying attention to the passing of the torch.. Charlie has the potential to be everything his father tells him is possible.
nothing refreshes your game like a brush with your own mortality
Carlie 👍🏽.. next pga golfer
The start of something great. Charlie will mold a footprint in the game, exactly how his father did.
In the nba there’s called “the eye test”   Charlie passes the eye test and then some. He inherited all of his dads fearlessness and natural feel for the game.
Oh man that kid is good!!
I can't tell who's putting lol
I didn't know you could be that good at such a young age, he already has an array of different shots!! Incredible, Oh and Tiger is pretty good also, Lol
Feck me.this kids a million bucks already.Im going to be a real keen follower.
What a gift. Welcome back Tiger and  his backup.
That tee shot at 17… WOW!!!
You see a proud tiger going out of the picture to let his cub to shine on his own.  👏👏👏👏👏
Well, we have another 40 years of a Woods domination coming up! Lol
Wow. Just...wow.  The Dalys obviously played some great golf and it was a well-deserved win, but this was truly spectacular.  What is that, 22 putts?
Ummm, Tiger looks dangerously able to contend
Some time you have to break a leg to perfect the swing! 🥰 CONGRATULATIONS 🎊
father now son wow i mean wow great job mr woods
Well, it's now sure starting to look more and more like Charlie Woods will eventually break all of his father's PGA golf records and golfing achievements in the future. As the video highlights here illustrate, this is not exactly your normal or average 12-year old golfer on display.
Man I loved watching this 🔥
I Love to See This Videos 👍👍❤️❤️
proud dad,dna is amazing.
Love these highlights but can we get some for Team Daly? The ones from some past tournaments were a treat because little Daly plays just like his dad too.
Charlie will win 20+ majors, what a talent
3:30 Charlie’s walk to his dads putt. No doubt, no questions, knew that was going in. On the 11th in a row birdie WOW!
Note to self: Never bet a 12 year old with a swing like that.
Looks like we got the next tiger woods in the making.
Charlie is absolutely brilliant. To be as good as he is at his age, he will be an inspiration to any other young kids watching him that also want to get into golf. Cute kid, who acts so professional and seems to keep his cool
Both the Tiger and JD teams were awesome golf TV this week
Man I love it hope he continues to play golf love seeing this great for the sport father son Charlie woods has the it just needs time
Charlie is just amazing, he will be in the pga tour someday
Can't wait to see Charlie destroy everyone when he's older.
Damn that kid has a powerful swing for his age/ stature
Tiger is creating and absolute monster when he gets older. Wow.
Tiger woods is the greatest of all time! I hope to see them on the tour together one day competing
Team Woods finished second, right?  Why not at least give the winners name!
in 5 years time Charlie is gonna be right on all these guys
Was on the verge of joyous tears watching these two play together.
WOW this is incredible to watch. I’m glad Charlie seems to be doing ok considering all the public bs his family has been through. Wtg kid!!!
Iou uu7 hi⁸9b bb
The mental game with charlie is insane
Charlie bring back the swag in golf. Wow!
This was so wholesome and pure. Bitter sweet as it almost felt like a passing of the torch moment but incredible to watch to say the least.
Charlie gonna be special
Charlie is a problem and everybody can see it... Not every stars kid has that konda natural poise.
Sorry folks  this just isn't normal..... I expect to see Daily's son and Woods son go at it for a lot of years.
kid can putt
I don't know what he hit @ 1:32 but the average ball speed on tour for a 3 iron in 2015 was under 144mph. I know he is limping around (for good reason) but he has barely played any golf and still has solid enough speed
What a confident kid.The way he picks his dads coin up and throws it to him on putts.This was fun to watch in t.v.
Looks like Tiger`s leg is hurting, understandably so but great to see him back, and Charlie, WOW.
Even if he doesnt play full time, if he plays with the same joy he did with his son watch out. It was beautiful.
I love how they interact with each other.  Their course language
This is unreal…
Looks like Tigers already ready for the Masters!
Tiger is playing far better than he’s letting on. Sure he’s lost some yardage, but his distance control is fantastic with a slower tempo. Fantastic around the greens as well. Truly incredible
We may be witnessing the birth of the next "Tiger"....Charlie. His swing is amazingly good; technically nearly perfect. He's twelve and he hits the ball a mile for his age. What a great finish for these two.
O moleque e brabo
charlie is going to set records and be the GOAT. golf has some amazing moments coming
Tiger is raising a stone cold killer around the golf course. At this rate I would be more surprised to not see him in pga in 10 years
Tiger and  Charlie Woods on the Golf Course Together December 2021 Priceless
To be honest, even if he never played again after this, the comeback could be complete here. Being able to play a couple of full rounds with his son again must be amazing
That was awesome to watch. OMG like father like son!
Does Charlie have a handicap yet? He looks like he's scratch already.
I don't think grown men want much smoke with Charlie ♥️God dam he's good
Cant believe they gave the most dangerous celebrity behind the wheel a golf cart. Insurance around there must be jam up
this is amazing but what about team Daly?
The icing on the cake would have been a playoff between team Woods and team Daly!!
17th hole par 3. 179 yards, Charlie hitting off the same tees as everyone else for that particular hole. CLOSEST TO THE PIN out of every single participant on the course. AT TWELVE YEARS OLD. Kid just might have a future lol.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 love it keep it up Charlie
Hate all you want that duo delievered.
Hit and giggle golf looks good on Tiger.
Man in 6 years 🔥💥
Young Charlie is the real deal. Same swing as dad and handles the pressure so good. With John dalys son and tigers aswell there's a good future in golf.
This is a Christmas 🎄 gift 🎁 from the Woods to the world 🌎 🌍.
Remember to revist my comment one year from now: Tiger and Charlie will win this event in 2022!!!
Really how about a highlight of the winners???? #teamdaly
Damn I think Charlie is going to challenge his dad’s legacy when he gets a little older he might be the new goat playing like that
Best tournament of the year. I wish this had been 4 rounds instead of 2.
The fact that Tiger is even walking around is insane, let alone swinging a club again.
wow so amazing.
Vintage tiger with new age tiger
Team Daly won, shot the same score as team Woods and no highlights video from their round?
We’re all Blessed to witness such an occurrence. Tiger being physically able to play and his Son being a chip off the old block at 12 years of age. Absolutely Amazing!
It's so awsome to watch these 2 play together. Happy holidays all 🎄👍
A putting masterclass
Congratulations to the Dalys. On their fantastic win. Im as big a tiger fan as you will find. But I think the Dalys winning was very overshadowed!
It's unfortunate that the WINNERS didn't get as much publicity.
kinda wild they made 11 birdies in a row and still lost
Great comeback for Tiger. Charlie ? He'll be a Goat soon !
15 under 57? Sheeesh!
Hope to see Charlie on the PGA tour one day.  Hope he keeps it up.
omg so teary. wish my kid to be the same,
The king of walking it in
Literally my favorite sports moment since the 2019 Masters. Is that also because I'm a Mets/Knicks/Jets fan? Partially.
how about highlights from the actual winners of the tournament ?
Who knows if he'll even touch his dad, but we all need to get used to the name CHARLIE WOODS!
Dang... I was smiling the whole time.
Hello World 2.0
MAGICAL.
Imagine when he goes pro and Tiger caddies for him. It'll be the second Woods reign.
Omg, golf is fun
Wow just too beautiful 😍
Really enjoyed the last three days.  Very fun to watch.  Charlie is so talented and Tiger looks so good.  I was shocked when they announced he was playing, I was like, "Playing?"  Not 100 percent of course, he said he has only played about 4-5 rounds, but it is amazing that he was able to do this.  🙌👏👏👏
It's great to see a father and son creating good memories! It will last for a life time.
If that doesnt put a smile on your face than you're cold hearted.
Tiger is an inspiration 🙌🏽
If only Earl Woods was here to see his grandson.
Lets remember these moments when charlie is the youngest number 1 on tour ever
Such a tough course. ;)    Golf os a skill.   Tiger was forced ro play at 2. (Cherry picking only the 'good' shots)  [-25 and you come in second to "Team Daly".   Must be rough.]
Before people start saying Charlie will break all of Tiger's records they should realize this... before Tiger turned 12 he had already won over 110 amateur tournaments. #bornwinner #godonlymadeone
Glad to see tiger back. Charlie is absolutely incredible and wish him the best, but it would be nice to cover some of the other team highlights like maybe the leading team day one or maybe the team that actually won?
Are we already back to, if Tiger is playing in a tournament no one else matters? It was great to see he and Charlie playing well but they didn’t win and what’s more there were at least 10 other Father/Son pairings.
wouw ...between impressed and heart warming ..
Tiger was Dialed in on that front nine.
No video of the winners? Daly and son?
You can tell they play together all the time.   Just another walk in the park for the Woods family.
I wonder if Charlie is better than tiger was at the same age? It's amazing to watch them both & the similarities to even the smallest of details.A star in the making! Could be another woods dominance in the future.
Awesome
I can shoot 72 under 😎
Wow the future is bright for Charlie what a player
I think Charlie is better than Tiger at this age.  A little golf prodigy in the making.
He's definitely his father's son 😎
There's something touching and moving about Charlie tossing the ball marker to his dad after sinking a put. You can imagine him doing this until Tiger is well into the back 9 of his life.
That Charlie kid's golf is unreal!
Great to see Tiger and Charlie playing again!
Love seeing Tiger and Charlie playing.
kids insane
The way Charlie handles pressure at his young age, is incredible.   Son of the goat, that’s for sure.
Dammit the kid is good and I know nothing about golfing ⛳
Tiger can win again, we saw it this weekend, though he should never lift weights again. It does nothing to help his golf anymore, it only makes him worse, more injury prone. Hope his recovery progresses to walking 18 holes on hilly courses. Charlie, great player.
Ridiculous
So excited for Tiger 2.0
Charlie was pur highlight reel today. But that Tee shot on The Par 3 17th, when the ball landed between the hole and The Lake was thing of beauty. I think Dan Hicks said he was the only Golfer to land it there today.  Î
Tiger and his mini me.
Insane finish ... Wow!
Imagine being 12yo with the confidence to attack pins like that in such spotlight. It's going to be interesting in a few years if he continues to pursue golf. The U.S. Amateur will become the most viewed event in the history of golf. And the old guy Tiger will probably be back competing at the pro level again.
Golfer Father Husband  2 for 3 ain't bad.
Tigers face looks a bit puffy/bloated...hmm i wonder how he recovered so fast lol
For many years I've wanted to play like Tiger, now I wish I could play like Charlie.  Great to see them play together,  great to see Tiger playing golf again.
Tiger, after good advice, has begun getting lessons from Charlie.
The best thing that happened in 2021. Period
Earlwoods is smiling up in heaven
what happend to the guys wo won?
Amazing!
good God-al-mighty!
Clone
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
I love how aggressive Charlie is towards the pins, reminds me of old school Tiger!
Charlie plays and act like a professional already , every aspect off his game is amazing :)
Sensational,
congratulations Tiger and Charlie Woods they both played amazing! Tiger woods is getting healthier from his injury!🐅
Charlie will follow in Tiger's footsteps.
5:55 mark is the absolute best part of this match, the father and son embrace
This was so fun to watch
Charlie already as focused and dialed in as his Dad. Amazing to see.
Those 2 shots on 16 and 17 were juste unbelievable 🤯🤯
Wonder if we'll see Charlie and Little John coming down the stretch of a major someday?
An absolute joy to watch. Hard to stop smiling. As if having Tiger back wasn't enough, Charlie is class! 👌
So this is the first time we've ever had a "GOAT" with a child that could potentially be another "GOAT"... correct??
This was a great showing for both Tiger and Charlie.
The apple didn't fall far from the tree is an understatement,  wowowowowow 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
That shot at 17 tho lol
So great to watch Tiger and Charlie.
To the world, it's Tiger Woods. To Charlie, he's just dad. 👍
Holy S%&$%&$ Charlie is a LION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Charlie can flat out putt!
Charlie definitely gonna win some Majors in the future!
Wow!
Gonna be fun watching Charlie dominate the PGA in a few short years
Well looks like Tiger was exaggerating a little bit, 2 weeks ago he told us he may never be able to play and then he comes in 2nd place, Tiger played the media like fools.
Chuck is going to be a problem! Dang
dont ever count Tiger out, now don't ever count Charlie Axl out lol
It's helps if your dad is a living legend.
Incredible, what a great putting stroke young Charlie has, I suppose he’s got a pretty decent coach😂. Great to see the 🐐 on a course again.
Great to see Tiger and Charlie playing well!
The red shirt woods r unstoppable lol
He is just a joy to watch, and what a putter , lazer line to the hole, he is a special young man, a super star in the making,
Keep in humble, Tiger.
this is like top 6 golf event!!! lets go team TIGER
Magnifique
Charlie Woods was born in golf ⛳️, growing up in golf ⛳️, and will get old in gold 👏🏿
Me thinks Jack Nicholas's record is in serious danger.  And if Tiger gets it, Charlie will get his.
Is this kid for real!?!!
I'm so glad to see him back.
This was the best Christmas present that I could have ever imagined.
How do these guys putt so damn good?? I’m jealous af 😂😂. Congrats to JD & JD2 for the win. But the story is Tiger’s unbelievable return & Charlie’s ability under pressure. He can take the golf world by storm in a few years if he really wants it bad enough 🔥⛳️
Fearless. Just like his dad.
Golf World In Serious Trouble When Ole Charlie Turns Pro#New Monster
That was ridiculous
Obviously the course is easy, but you still have to make the putts, and this little kid makes them like it is easy
Nice to see the Dalys win.
Imagine Charlies level of play, five years from now.....wanna see him in The Open + The Masters, for example 2025 or -26!   Merry Merry Merry Happy New Christmas Plandemic Year to all of you! Ho Ho Ho!  /Santa Swede     (hi, Schwab, Gates, Soros, Rockefellers and Rothchilds)
That's really special...congratulations Tiger and Charlie!
This can genuinely bring a tear to my eye. Love seeing this
Tiger  the best golf  player  ever !
JOHN DALY WOOOOOOOOOO
Tiger is such an inspiration man. And to be playing alongside his son? What a feeling
Mantap pak
Charlie has a better swing then anyone right now in the world
They came in 2nd place! A great showing for Tiger’s first match since his accident. P.S. Charlie’s gonna be a beast, watch out for this kid.
Wow Charlie
Incredible how Charlie can play golf at that age without showing any signs of pressure what so ever, and playing to such a high standard
This is mesmerising to watch. Charlie is ridiculously good
First biggest fan
